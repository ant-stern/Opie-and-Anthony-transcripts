<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Nick Wallenda's tightrope walk, contrasting his successful Grand Canyon feat with New York City's rejection of his proposed Chrysler Building-Empire State Building walk. This segued into commentary on the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals, with Opie admitting his incorrect predictions.  The bulk of the early segment focused on intense and highly offensive commentary surrounding the George Zimmerman trial.  The hosts, along with "Little Jimmy,"  criticized the media's focus on the defense attorney's ill-advised joke, arguing it overshadowed crucial elements like the 911 call supporting Zimmerman's self-defense claim.  MSNBC's apology for using profanity during coverage was mocked.  The hosts also derided Harvey Levin's vapid celebrity-focused Twitter questions and offered cynical commentary on Paula Deen's apology for using the N-word and Al Sharpton's surprisingly lenient response, attributing it to Sharpton's own past issues.  They discussed Marsha Clark's appearance and predicted potential unrest if Zimmerman was acquitted, all while liberally using vulgar and offensive language.

The show then shifted to further comments on Marsha Clark's appearance, a brief mention of Marc Maron's impending appearance, and the anniversary of Michael Jackson's death.  They promoted their podcast, highlighting episodes featuring 8-track porn, Patrice O'Neill, and Scott Thorson.  Further podcast ideas, including Dave Rabbit's Vietnam radio tapes and a Tony Danza bit, were discussed. A significant portion of this segment was devoted to playful but pointed mockery of E-Rock, a staff member, for unexpectedly wearing a collared shirt. This led to speculation about his motivation, mainly whether it was an attempt to secure a cameo in Chris Rock's movie being filmed at Sirius XM. Chris Rock's presence and the movie filming were discussed extensively, with anticipation for the hosts' potential brief appearance.  The banter was punctuated by interruptions from staff, including Jackie the intern, delivering coffee and later napkins. The conversation eventually circled back to Marc Maron's upcoming visit, including discussion of Buffalo, his podcast anniversary, and a story about a shirtless Iggy Pop visit.  Maronâ€™s engagement was announced, along with details about his anxieties and unconventional proposal.  Rich Voss and Kenny were also mentioned.

Marc Maron then appeared as a guest. The conversation centered on his upcoming marriage to a much younger woman, his anxieties about fatherhood, and his complicated relationship with his own father.  He recounted his humorous (though thrice-repeated) marriage proposal involving pancakes and a hot ring. He detailed the challenges of the relationship, including a disastrous Washington D.C. trip that culminated in an argument and a temporary ring return. Maron's fear of large bodies of water was explored, leading to humorous anecdotes about his phobias. The conversation also touched upon his upcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, his experiences on other late-night shows, and the potential fallout from revelations in his book and IFC show.  He promoted *Attempting Normal* and his IFC show. Nick Wallenda's future appearance on the show was also mentioned.

The final segment, recorded live at the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on July 20th, featured Amy Schumer, Artie Lange, and David Tell. The broadcast was frequently interrupted by the filming of a movie, resulting in informal conversations between Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss, a crew member involved in the film production.  Voss's increasingly frustrated complaints about his perceived marginalization on set were a recurring theme.  A detailed and speculative discussion of the TWA Flight 800 crash documentary ensued, debating the merits of the missile strike theory versus the official explanation, with considerable speculation about cover-ups.  The hosts and guests used offensive and vulgar language throughout. The show concluded with further interruptions from the movie filming, including interactions with other crew members and more frustrated comments from Voss.  Numerous crude and offensive jokes were made throughout this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What the planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little.  What?  He's getting over here.  It only says he's getting over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, God damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes. Good morning, everybody.  Look at that. We're back on the air again. Wow. 
[00:01:30]  It's been 20 hours.  Thank you, Jesus. Lord, thank you, Lord.  Thank you, King of Kings.  King of Kings.  Jesus.  Under the authority of God.  That's right.  Jesus, thank you, Jesus.  And I want to pat ourselves on the back, because silly Nick Walenda,  he did the Grand Canyon thing, saying, Jesus, every other step.  Uh-huh. Wants to do that tightrope thing here in New York City,  between the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, 
[00:02:00]  which would be about 4,000 feet.  Pretty good.  And the city has already said, go find another city.  We don't need you. We don't want you.  No, we said that yesterday. They're just not going to allow that.  No. No.  I think it would be cool if they did, but...  That would be wild.  You know, I want zip lines, you know, from fucking skyscraper to skyscraper.  I think that would be cool as hell.  Well, get you through that crosstown traffic.  Sure.  They're too worried about him falling on somebody.  Yeah.  That's what they said.  They said, if he falls in the Grand Canyon, he falls,  but if it's New York, he's no random.  You just close some fucking streets for, what would it take? 
[00:02:30]  A couple hours?  Tell him to do it in the middle of the night while the city sleeps.  Yeah.  It's like, don't worry about one guy falling off a tightrope.  How about your cranes that are fucking toppling over all the time?  Wow.  Don't worry about one guy.  Right.  I just saw a picture of the Grand Canyon walk.  Yeah.  Look at...  I mean, that was not straight across.  You had to go downhill and back uphill.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Isn't that crazy?  That is fucked up.  Why is there a dip?  Is that to prevent it from blowing?  There's no possible way to stretch it out. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, that is straight.  That is a heavy, heavy cable, man.  It has to have...  All cables got some sag to them.  And what is it, about 1,500 feet he did, right?  With that heavy cable?  Yeah.  That is a dip, though.  I didn't realize he dipped that much.  That's from one end to the other, looking right down the cable, so it's really going  to look pretty extreme.  Yeah, but he's dropped down pretty good from where he started.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  So he doesn't get to do the tightrope thing here in New York?  No.  He shouldn't have asked. 
[00:03:30]  He should have fucking, you know, did the Philippe Petit thing.  Why not?  We're ready for a Philippe Petit thing.  I think those days are gone.  Yeah.  Going up and fucking stringing wires from building to building.  Yeah.  Fucking NYPD sniper team will be on you.  Jesus.  Fuck that.  And then I guess we've got to congratulate the Chicago Blackhawks.  Hockey is officially over.  That's it, huh?  We won the Stanley Cup last night, beating the Bruins in just a heartbreak of a game for  Bruins fans.  It was pretty much done. 
[00:04:00]  The Bruins were pretty much thinking, you know...  Game seven.  That's it.  They had, what, less than two minutes to go to force a game seven, and then the Blackhawks  turned around and scored twice in, I think, 17 seconds.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  And I apologize once again to everybody.  I picked the Bruins, and I did pick the Spurs.  Oh, boy.  For the people that keep track of the sports curse.  What happened?  I did it again.  Man, I fucking can't pick a fucking winner. 
[00:04:30]  And we're not even talking points or odds or nothing.  Just fucking trying to pick a team.  I can't do it.  Yeah.  Bruins, Spurs.  Those are good picks.  I guess.  They were good picks.  Hoisting the cup up.  Oh, nice.  Oh, the language. 
[00:05:00]  Gotta go with the language.  Yeah, fucking right, Spurs.  Fucking right, yeah.  Did this go out over NBC?  Yeah.  Woo!  Your mother's coming.  He just starts blurting shit out.  Black dick.  Fucking A, baby.  We want to apologize for that last segment.  Yeah.  You may have heard, it's very exuberant.  Oh, do we apologize, please? 
[00:05:30]  Oh, God, Jesus.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Anyway, in other news, here's 20 dead bodies from around the world.  Yeah.  In graphic HD detail of brains and skull and fucking mush face.  But we're really sorry for the fucking...  But, oh, you heard some bad language, ho.  Oh, my God.  We're all going to be fired.  Yeah, it was terrible.  Oh, God.  Quickly get to the mangled bodies from around the world.  Fucking...  We're just a stupid society, aren't we? 
[00:06:00]  We really are.  Can't handle the fucks and the fuck yous, but we can handle the dead bodies.  No.  That is a strange way to look at things.  So, there you go, man.  No more hockey.  Yeah.  No more hockey.  Finally.  That's it.  What's left now?  Basketball's done.  Yeah.  Hockey done.  And then baseball's just sitting there.  Just fucking stagnates for the summer until, you know...  The playoffs and then...  Weed out until the playoffs. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I'm fucking...  Yeah.  I just realized...  I'll say it again.  I am not a baseball fan.  No.  I was in denial for a long time.  I don't...  It's just...  Who gives a fuck?  It's just the river in Sweden.  Who gives a fuck?  162 fucking games.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  It's too many fucking games.  A lot of games.  I want to go to a Yankee game, though, this year.  I want to go to the stadium.  It's great.  I want to see the stadium.  I went.  Yeah.  And I loved it.  And I don't even know who won.  It was a social event.  Drink a couple beers.  Have some food. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I want to do that.  A few lofts.  Some lofts.  And then beat the traffic out in the eighth inning.  Old days, you do that.  Everyone's yelling and screaming at you.  Oh, fair weather fan.  But now you see everyone just trying to beat the traffic.  I'm a fair weather fan.  I love when the weather's nice.  Fair.  Go out there and sit.  Watch the game.  Fucking home run, Komiya.  Nice.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  I didn't hear that joke, but I heard he did a joke.  Oh, it was wonderful.  I want to hear audio.  I've only heard about it.  It's terrible. 
[00:07:30]  Well, both guys had a bad start in the Zimmerman trial.  Oh, it's terrible.  They both had a bad start.  Don West.  He'd have been better with that Don West.  Yeah.  Which one do you want to go with the knock, knock?  Or do you want to go with the F?  That's the big story that all the news channels are playing is the knock, knock joke.  Right.  That's the big one.  Defense attorney Don West for George Zimmerman gets up, and I guess he's trying to get a little 
[00:08:00]  rapport going with the brand new jury that was just seated for the first day, opening  statements of the trial yesterday.  So he decides to go for a joke.  A little joke.  Just to lighten the...  During a second degree murder trial.  Just lighten the mood a little bit.  Yeah, and if you've noticed during these trials, if you really do keep tabs and watch the trial  as it goes, like Casey Anthony was another big trial that was televised down there in 
[00:08:30]  Florida, you'll notice that a while into the trial, maybe a week or two in, there's that  nervous tension that sometimes can be broken with a joke, or there's an awkward moment that  can only be broken with a joke, and it's been known to happen.  But to just pull out this ham-handed attempt at a horrible joke the first day, it just was  a dumb thing for him to do. 
[00:09:00]  Did he get a big laugh?  It got less than zero.  Oh boy, it was not good.  It was such a bomb.  Not good.  That's the last thing Zimmerman needed, was a fucking bad joke by his attorney.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Zimmerman got huge, man.  I'm not...  Zimmerman is a chubby boy.  I'm not really following this shit that closely.  I didn't...  He's gained, what, over 100 pounds?  Well, the white Hispanics always will.  Chubby boy.  Yes, white Hispanic.  Wow.  That means, but... 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  So, he got up there.  Wow.  I can't believe that's the same guy.  I know.  We're seeing him on the TV right now.  I wonder if that's on purpose, if he's panicking, or if he wants to have a certain...  To look less menacing.  I mean, not that you planned that out, but is he just eating, or is he like...  Oh, he's stress eating.  I think he's just eating like a motherfucker.  Yeah, that's stress eating.  That's a lot of weight.  Wow.  I can't believe it's the same guy.  Anyway.  He's big.  Yeah.  The thing is, though, that's the clip that all the news agencies are playing, you know, 
[00:10:00]  all the fucking shows.  No surprise.  And it's, yeah.  It's that, but they're not concentrating on anything with the trial.  They're just playing this fucking clip and going, ah, that was bad.  The truth of the matter is, once the 911 guy got up, or actually the non-emergency operator,  who it was, it wasn't even a 911 call, got up there and the defense started questioning  him.  It was all about the defense.  Like, the prosecution, and he was, the operator was a prosecution witness.  And the fact of the matter is, the defense got so much more out of this guy that helped 
[00:10:30]  George Zimmerman than the prosecution ever could.  Right.  You know, they dispelled the whole thing of this big stalking and chase that supposedly  happened.  None of that happened.  And there's a viable reason now for George Zimmerman to have followed him for a time,  which he was doing, because the operator was actually saying, all right, well, tell me  what else he does.  And then he goes, okay, keep an eye on him. 
[00:11:00]  So now, in two instances, this operator is suggesting that George Zimmerman keeps an eye  on this guy.  And the defense was questioning the operator, saying, couldn't you assume that by what you  said that he would want to keep him in his vision, in his sight?  The guy's like, yeah, yeah, I could assume that.  And he goes, and there it is again.  And they're playing the tape.  And then he goes, all right, and there it is again.  You just asked him again if you could tell him what to do.  Keep an eye on him. 
[00:11:30]  And then you hear him get out of the vehicle at one point, and you can hear him moving  and the wind from the cell phone, and he's moving.  He goes, are you following him?  He goes, yes.  He goes, okay, we don't need you to do that.  And then you hear that sound, stop.  He goes, now, don't you hear that sound anymore?  And he's like, no.  He goes, what do you hear George Zimmerman say after you say, we don't need you to do  that?  He says, I believe George Zimmerman said, okay.  Like, all of this stuff that's been in the news about him chasing him down, and the police  ordered him to cease and desist and not to talk. 
[00:12:00]  All that falls right apart.  You didn't hear any of that?  Never happened.  I never heard that played before where the guy says, keep an eye on him.  They don't play that one as much on them.  Yes, in two instances during that call, he's like, all right, tell me what he does.  Well, keep an eye on him.  Where is he going?  What is it?  Like, all this can be, you know, it's not an absolute, but you can absolutely assume  that the guy was fine with George Zimmerman keeping an eye on him.  Right.  Because they want to know, and he's like, now, why would you want to know the location 
[00:12:30]  of this guy?  He goes, well, for the police, to give the police as much information.  Why would you need to know that he's black?  He was black.  The information for the police, the description.  Why would you need to know what he was wearing?  Police.  The police are being sent there.  We need to give the police that information.  So, all of this that was chewed apart by people that are working on nothing but emotion can  now see it in testimony that this is not the case.  He wasn't chasing down with his gun out. 
[00:13:00]  He wasn't stalking somebody.  He was following someone that he had called 911 on to give information to the operator as  to where this guy is for when the police show up.  That's it.  And his demeanor on the call, they kept asking the guy, who was six years on the job as an  operator, did George Zimmerman sound angry at this point?  Did he sound like he was upset?  Did he sound...  No.  His demeanor was very calm through the whole thing. 
[00:13:30]  There wasn't any indication that he had any ulterior motive to go out and kill someone  that night.  And this is one witness in.  Now, what you'll hear on the news is, knock, knock, who's there?  Which is a horrid mistake for that.  But they're not playing the other part.  And this, by the way, will only, if George Zimmerman is acquitted, will only rile people  up because the news will have fed everyone all this stuff that still makes George Zimmerman  look guilty.  And if he's acquitted on the facts that only the jury and people that are watching the 
[00:14:00]  trial see, the regular person that has watched the news will be like, how did this guy get  off with knock-knock guy and chasing him down and stalking?  So, because the news isn't reporting this.  They're going to be culpable in any fucking riots because they're not reporting this trial  as it's happening and being honest about it.  They're giving this presentation that George Zimmerman is guilty.  And if he's acquitted, the layman who gets his info from the news is going to be like,  how'd that happen? 
[00:14:30]  Must be injustice.  But the knock-knock joke is fantastic.  But the knock-knock joke is a horrible bomb.  It is amazing how they're...  Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying.  Oh.  So let me...  Didn't you start off your set like this back in 2008?  I think that's how you start off.  Sometimes...  I'd like to tell you a little joke.  I know how that...  Here it comes, Alice.  Night on a dog, Alice!  Night on a dog!  But I think you're the perfect audience for it.  Oh.  As long as you don't... 
[00:15:00]  If you don't like it or you don't think it's funny or inappropriate,  that you don't hold it against Mr. Zimmerman.  You can hold it against me.  What are you doing?  Can you believe this?  What are you doing?  Can you believe this?  I have your assurance.  You won't.  Here's how it goes.  Here it comes.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  George Zimmerman.  George Zimmerman who?  All right, good.  You're on the jury.  Nothing? 
[00:15:30]  That's funny.  After what you folks have been through the last two or three weeks?  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Boo!  This is going great.  Be more funny!  Oh, God.  Okay.  OMG.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  So? 
[00:16:00]  Is it Mr. Right?  That was...  Okay, fuck it!  What's next?  An incredible bomb.  That's why everything you just said doesn't matter.  Exactly.  Because they have to go with that.  That's what they're playing on every fucking news day.  You're giving the news way too much credit.  Right.  Dude, he started off...  Folks!  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  This is a joke.  Here it comes.  You might laugh.  You don't want to...  It's literally the worst setup.  It's a terrible situation to do it in.  Uh-huh. 
[00:16:30]  But to actually say it might make you laugh, it might...  I've never heard anybody set themselves up to bomb so terribly.  The setup was longer than the actual joke.  Yes.  Way longer.  Oh, God.  That was horrible.  Uncomfortable.  Yeah.  If he had just done it...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If he had said, look, I know how this has been going.  It's been crazy with the media.  Yeah.  You know, knock, knock, who's there?  George Zimmerman, who?  You're on the jury.  You're on the jury.  I mean, that's the job you guys have had.  Like, as an aside, not this big fucking grand setup. 
[00:17:00]  Sometimes you've got to laugh to keep from crying.  Sometimes you must laugh.  Laugh, clown laugh.  You put Velcro on the ceiling, ladies and gentlemen.  That's terrible.  Three, if you slice them thin enough.  But I digress.  I digress.  Yeah.  Guilty.  Will the defendant please rise? 
[00:17:30]  The warden.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.  But...  Wet his lips and stick him to the window.  Ladies and germs, I'm here all week.  Ladies and germs.  Why would he try to swim with all those chains?  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.  If you find my defendant.  Yes.  Tires don't sing when you put chains on them.  But seriously, folks.  You know.  You know.  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Very bad.  Bad start.  Bad start.  Bad start.  And, yeah, the defense team really has to step up.  The only saving grace is the fact that the prosecution has a horrendous job in trying to prove this case.  There's nothing as far as true evidence that this is any more than a self-defense case.  It's not second-degree murder. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, you just...  It's not.  And it's a viable self-defense case.  He's injured.  It's proof that he was beaten, most likely by Trayvon.  He answered with one shot at point-blank range at the last possible moment.  Where'd the shot hit him?  Right in the chest.  At the last possible moment.  And, but, you know, the defense has to steer clear of these traps that the prosecution will set 
[00:19:00]  to pull them into this world of static smoke and mirrors,  that whole peripheral shit that the prosecution's going to pour into this case  because they really don't have anything for the actual case,  which is what the defense should stick to.  So yesterday, the trial ended...  Yesterday, they ended with the prosecution playing a couple of 911 tapes  from prior calls that Zimmerman had made. 
[00:19:30]  And then, after the first call, the defense gets up and goes,  I want all that stricken from the record, and I don't want this being able to be played.  And then the judge is like, you were asked if you have any objection to letting these into evidence,  these two tapes.  Yeah, I meant the mechanics of it, not the content and that.  I don't want it in.  Wait, wait, who wanted it stricken?  The defense didn't want any unrelevancy.  He's like, look, the calls that George Zimmerman made prior to this have nothing to do with this case. 
[00:20:00]  So as far as relevancy goes, I don't want these in.  But he should have objected to that when they tried to put it in evidence in the first place.  She said the defense attorney fucked up.  The defense attorney fucked up!  It's like he should have just objected right away to having him even put into evidence.  So right after they played the first tape, which is George Zimmerman calling 911 and saying,  neighbor's been robbed, my wife saw some guy that fits the description of one of the people  that have robbed our neighbor, he's out there, I want you to come. 
[00:20:30]  And what this does, I guess, for the prosecution's thinking, is sets up this kind of pattern.  Profiling pattern.  A profiling pattern.  I mean, if you have 10 fucking 911 calls from George Zimmerman and it's 10 black guys in  hoodies, it could be looked at like, all right, is this guy just after black guys with hoodies?  Truth of the matter is, everyone that's breaking into that place is a black guy in a hoodie.  It's not George's fault that his description is the same every time.  It's the black guys in the hoodies that are robbing the fucking place that seem to be the  problem.  But the prosecution can present it as a pattern. 
[00:21:00]  Now, relevancy is, that is a fucking issue.  So they got to argue that.  So the judge is like, look, you fucking, you didn't put it in, you didn't object to it  when we put it in.  And she, but she is allowing an argument to go.  So they dismissed the jury yesterday for the, for the rest of the day as they discussed  this.  And then they decided they were just going to recess until nine today and argue it like  from eight 30 to nine outside the view of the jury and then start the case again at 
[00:21:30]  nine today.  So, uh, that's where they stopped yesterday.  But I was sitting there before it even happened.  I'm watching going, why the fuck are they allowing these previous calls to be played?  The prosecution argued that since in the tape that is relevant, he says, oh, these, these  assholes always get away.  Oh, these fuckers, uh, do this all the time.  He said it's relevant to see which assholes had gotten away in the past, uh, you know, 
[00:22:00]  and to play those tapes.  But the defense is arguing that none of these have relevancy.  And if they do allow this in, then some prior, uh, uh, records of Trayvon's can be brought  in.  By the way, this is what the post talks about.  This is what the paper says.  Yeah.  Curse of the killer.  Oh, Trayvon trial opens with an F bomb.  Like, but I mean, that's what the papers.  And that's the defense.  The prosecution opened with, you know, fucking.  The word fuck.  Yeah.  Again.  That's what you're going to see, though, in this case. 
[00:22:30]  We got the clip.  Yep.  Counsel.  Good morning.  Good morning.  The defense.  Fucking pumps.  These assholes, they always get away.  Those were the words in that grown man's mouth.  Point six.  Remember.  As he followed in the dark, a 17 year old boy.  Boy.  Oh, stop it.  Who he didn't know.  Ugh.  And excuse my language, but those were his words, not mine. 
[00:23:00]  Ah.  Fucking punks.  These assholes, they always get away.  Those were the words in that man's chest when he got out of his car, armed with a fully  loaded semi-automatic.  Well, we have decided that we have to institute a seven second delay.  I want to apologize.  Oh, my God.  Fucking.  Go.  The news should just go away.  That was what?  That was MSNBC.  And they're not even bound by the FCC. 
[00:23:30]  No, no.  Right.  Cable news.  It's obviously a huge trial, and as a news organization, you're going to fucking tap out  of real language that's going down in the courtroom.  That's our country right there.  Yes.  Dumb fucking Americans.  And then, like we just joked about, they'll go to a story where there's some fucking bloody  body on the street.  Wow.  It's in a court where...  Because for some reason, that's okay.  It's in a court of law where, you know, protocol and things are very strictly adhered to, respect  of the court.  And that's allowed because it's such an integral part of the trial.  Well, it's allowed on MSNBC, Jimmy. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  People get confused, but on MSNBC, you're allowed to curse.  And the context of it, though, isn't just, you know, some punks running around cursing.  This is testimony.  This is fucking, you know...  Oh, my God.  And they can't even excuse it for that.  They have to apologize?  Oh, Christ.  Un-fucking-believable.  It's disgusting.  It's embarrassing.  Our media is disgusting.  Dude, they're embarrassing.  Wow.  Wow.  We're very sorry for the...  Like, we don't mind you hearing about the 17-year-old being shot in the chest. 
[00:24:30]  Right, right.  Sorry the F-word slipped out.  Right.  God, they are fucking terrible.  The incident itself was horrific, what went down that night, no matter whose side you're  on.  That is...  But let's not curse on our TV.  How...  Dude, that's embarrassing.  It really is.  Embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  We're in an embarrassing country.  Ah, seven-second delay.  Oh!  We're going to tap out of the biggest trial in the country, which you all know somebody winds 
[00:25:00]  up dead in, because the F-word was used.  Legally, we don't have to, but we're such whores for the advertisers that General Electric  or General Mills or whoever the fuck else is advertising may walk away, not on the murder  talk, but on the F-bomb.  Right.  So being the prostitutes that we are, we're going to back out until we can somehow repaint  Zimmerman terribly again for you.  God, do they suck.  It's complete lunacy.  It's unbelievable.  They are terrible, man.  Holy fuck!  Our priorities in this fucking country are so screwy. 
[00:25:30]  It's insanity.  And the press is a disgrace.  I've got to hear that again.  They're a disgrace.  They are.  They are.  I've got to hear it again.  A total disgrace.  I would almost understand if it was a regular network, because like, hey, they don't need  an FCC complaint.  I would almost...  But the fact that that's MSNBC...  Not bound by FCC.  And the FCC would not...  Probably never know.  No, they would not.  No.  That was a live feed, right?  Live feed, news-oriented.  Oh, my God.  Counsel. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  Good morning.  Counsel.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Fucking pumps.  Oh, that's what I called the jury.  These assholes, they always get away.  Those were the words in that grown man's mouth.  As he followed in the dark a 17-year-old boy...  Oh, stop it.  ...who he didn't know.  And excuse my language, but those were his words, not mine.  My fucking punks. 
[00:26:30]  These assholes, they always get away.  Because they do.  Those were the words in that man's chest when he got out of his car, armed with a fully loaded  semi-automatic...  Well, we have decided that we have to institute a seven-second delay.  I want to apologize for that language that came out.  Oh, you fucking...  Oh, my God.  And it's too late anyway.  And it sounds like they're kind of moving on from that point.  Right, right.  So they can't even figure that shit out in their head. 
[00:27:00]  That's amazing.  What, they had to show some kind of responsibility?  Oh, with babies.  With what?  With what?  Like, first of all, do you honestly think, if you want to say we're protecting the children,  do you think that children are watching the Zimmerman trial?  Of course.  On MSNBC?  I don't think so.  The truth of the matter is, no one's watching the Zimmerman trial on MSNBC.  No one's watching MSNBC.  What parent needs their children protected from the F word?  I know. 
[00:27:30]  It's ridiculous.  I don't think there would have been one complaint.  I don't care.  I curse around my kids.  Yeah.  Maybe that's bad, but I'm not going to go down that road.  And I don't need TV to fucking raise my kids.  What the fuck is going on in this country?  Thank God they cut that off and apologized.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  That's why.  I watch it on the online feed.  It's so much better.  You don't get the commercials.  You don't get the commentary.  You just sit there.  There's no graphic on the bottom.  You get everything that happens in that courtroom. 
[00:28:00]  You get it pure.  Uncut.  Exactly.  Isn't that more pushing people towards the internet?  Totally.  Even cable is blowing it.  Yes.  Yes.  I was ready to make this point.  But the internet doesn't understand that everyone wants their shit real.  Real talk.  And they fuck up all the time now, too.  Like TMZ recently.  We didn't do the story because we ran out of time.  What was it?  The Kate Upton topless shots?  You know, they're advertising on TMZ, which is, you know, that's their world.  All that gossipy shit. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  That they got topless pictures of Kate Upton.  Who doesn't want to see that, right?  Hubba hubba.  You go to TMZ and you don't see the topless shots.  So what the fuck are they doing?  Yeah.  And they could show it.  TMZ could show topless shots.  Whoa.  Well, now they're showing it.  Why is she on a horse naked?  Well, now they're showing it.  That's pretty nice.  Yeah.  That's what someone said when they walked.  I always feel too long.  Knock, knock. 
[00:29:00]  Originally, they did not show the topless shots.  I don't know.  But now they're showing them.  So, okay.  I can't.  Maybe they got too many people going, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, where is it?  Because when it first hit TMZ, they did not show that at all.  Wow.  Now you get to see it.  Those are some hangers she's got there.  She's got some big and heavies.  She's going to be a huge girl eventually, by the way.  Yeah.  They're pixelated.  I can't stand.  Are they pixelated?  Oh, we can't tell from here.  Yeah, I think the nipples are.  Oh, well. 
[00:29:30]  If you look at your computer from six feet away, they're not pixelated.  They're not pixelated.  I hate TMZ.  I click on their links on Twitter all the time because they have a thing like that.  And you'll be like, oh, I want to see it.  And I refuse to click on it.  I still get bamboozled, though, every so often because I can't stand clicking on it.  And it's like, today we noticed that, oh, my God.  They have that over-the-top fucking shit.  Cartoon guy.  And you feel less of a human just for watching it.  It's terrible. 
[00:30:00]  Crap.  Kate, I mean, everyone's about gossipy, Gertie.  Everyone is all about Kate Upton, but she's going to be a huge fucking bitch.  She's a thick girl.  She's a thick girl.  Her self-life is maybe two more years.  That's it.  And she's going to be as big as that fucking doorway eventually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a thick girl.  She's got youth on her side right now.  She's a big girl.  Big through the hips.  Big roomie.  Roomie.  Can we see what's-his-name has tweeted lately?  It's one of my favorite things we do.  He asks questions. 
[00:30:30]  I know.  If we're doing TMZ, we've got to go to the Ask Questions segment.  Do you think?  What do you think?  What are your opinions?  Well, how about you?  It's your Twitter.  How about you tell us what you think?  Yeah.  Harvey.  And they're the most inane questions.  Yeah.  What are the questions like, who cares?  What are some of the questions Harvey's asking these days, Sam Roberts?  Chris Brown, accused of assaulting girl in nightclub.  What do you believe? 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  I believe he did.  Yes.  All right.  Now what?  How about Harvey, you tell us what you believe?  Nick Orlando, Grand Canyon Highwire.  Thank you, Jesus.  Was it Jesus or luck on Nick's side?  Oh, Reverend Al is looking terrible.  Well, we got some Paula Deen Reverend Al shit that we're going to do in a little bit here.  Wow.  What else?  Miley Cyrus rocks shortest shorts imaginable. 
[00:31:30]  I clicked on that.  What do you think of her latest look?  Oh, God, does he suck.  What do you think?  How about you tell us?  These are like the Dennis Falcone radio tricks.  He's terrible.  Engaging your...  Engage your audience.  Involve them.  And he's got like a billion Twitter followers.  For what reason?  He just asks dumb questions.  Because they did the fucking...  The people that like him, they're like, oh, yes, let me type in.  I don't know what I believe.  Because I think Harvey's going to read my tweet.  I know he's going to.  I'm part of this story.  Right.  People are going to have a lot of insight on this. 
[00:32:00]  Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus make peace for lunch anyway.  Do you think they will call off the divorce?  I don't know.  I'm not in their lives.  I have no fucking idea what's going on.  Who fucking gives a shit to the umpteenth degree who gives a shit?  But this is his thing, man.  Every day he just asks questions on his Twitter.  He's got questions.  That's like Troy Quang.  Anything else?  That's about it for today.  How about one more, Sam?  Paula Deen's ridiculous video apology for using the N-word. 
[00:32:30]  Do you think her apology was sincere?  Who cares?  Yeah, if I wanted to know what I thought, I would follow myself on Twitter.  Right.  Yes.  Right.  Right.  I would just read my own feed.  I've never even given this thought.  Yes?  What do I think?  Oh, my God.  James Gandolfini reportedly guzzled eight drinks hours before his death.  Could it have a connection to his death?  Well, all right. 
[00:33:00]  Now you got me pissed off.  I'm a medical examiner.  Let me.  He's a cunt for that tweet.  Yeah.  The guy wasn't guzzling drinks.  Was he enjoying himself and having a few drinks?  Yes.  But this asshole has to twist it because it's not tragic enough and make it sound like he's  just there like.  Hey, it's a very difficult situation.  Guzzling fucking drinks.  He wasn't guzzling drinks.  Guzzling.  Guzzling is very different than, you know, having a bunch of drinks at dinner.  Yeah, it wasn't like it was 40 drinks.  It was eight.  But he's saying guzzle like he's just like, oh, my God, I'm just slamming these back one 
[00:33:30]  after another.  Jesus Christ.  Paula Dane.  Oh, my God.  Waka Flocka says I'm producing Amanda Bynes' rap album.  She's going to kill the game.  Can she make it as a rapper?  I don't know.  How would I know that?  I don't have any insight to that shit.  I would guess no.  I'm going to guess no.  Okay. 
[00:34:00]  There.  Oh, that's it?  That was my, yeah.  So you're going to tweet Harvey and just write no?  Yeah, no.  Okay, that's good.  You could answer all of Harvey's things with a yes or no.  I think I might just start doing that.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Harvey's the one who's supposed to know the answers.  Yeah, you're the inside guy.  It's not even that bad that he's like asking questions because it simulates conversation.  I understand that part of it.  But the fact is, he never gives his own opinion on any of this shit.  No.  No.  Like, how about you ask the question and then give what you think? 
[00:34:30]  Harvey's Twitter.  Is it good?  Right.  No.  No.  Fifty Shades of Grey movie finds a female director.  What do you make of the decision?  Oh.  Wow.  He's simple.  That's terrible.  Wow.  But, and then he'll never tell you what he thinks.  No.  But they're not even interesting questions.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  About a female director.  That's not interesting at all.  At least phrase it better.  Director has cunt.  What's on your mind? 
[00:35:00]  We had a mom.  Go.  Discuss.  We had a mom once, didn't we, when he first started that TMZ thing?  Yeah.  Yep.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Peter King's Jizza teaches kids science with least lame rap ever.  Is using rap to educate a good idea?  Why slash why not?  Oh.  Why not?  Yeah.  Wow.  Complete sentences only.  Yes.  Show your work.  Wow.  He added why not on that one.  Usually it's just why.  Well, he's giving you two options.  Why?  Wow.  He's like, even if you don't think so, let's hear it. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  Let's hear it.  What do you think?  Harvey?  What do you think?  Harvey.  All answers have to start with using rap to educate is a good idea because.  Yeah.  This way you can.  Yeah.  You're running out of characters fast at that point.  Well, still.  He wants to know why.  Why not?  Yep.  Does he give one stupid opinion on anything on his Twitter?  Yes.  You found an opinion?  I think this counts.  Okay.  Slash.  No shirt.  No shoes.  No top hat. 
[00:36:00]  What do you think of his look?  He's not.  But he's not giving an opinion.  Oh, I was incorrect.  Oh.  I guess I was wrong on that one.  All right.  I have to know who wore the top hat.  I need to know now.  I got roped in.  I got roped in.  You got roped in.  Who did the top hat thing?  Is that Slash without a top hat?  Yeah.  He's just saying Slash went swimming and he didn't have a top hat on.  That's it?  That's a story?  But you know what?  What?  I wouldn't even recognize that as Slash.  No sunglasses.  No hat. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I'd be like, I don't know who that is.  Wow.  I never would have guessed who that was.  Wow.  Yeah.  You kind of see it if you look.  I don't know, dude.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not a bad one.  Good pick.  Good pick.  But of course he's not swimming with a top hat.  I mean, Jesus.  Of course he's not.  Ah, boy.  J. Cole, gun-toting Twitter fan investigated by police.  Should the fan be charged for the incident? 
[00:37:00]  What?  I guess there was a gun incident, but now he's asking his Twitter followers if legally this  fan should be charged for...  Why don't we just find out from the police...  Right.  ...whether or not he should be charged?  What?  Right.  No one cares.  All right.  Well...  No one fucking cares.  It was nice to see Kate Upton Topless, though.  I'll tell you that much.  Paula Deen, I've used the N-word, but I'm not racist.  Racist or not?  Share your thoughts.  How the fuck do you know?  Well, you don't know. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  I think how she used the word doesn't make her a racist, but I have no idea if she is  a racist.  30 years ago.  In that deposition, that's when she said nigger.  30 years ago.  She loses her fucking empire over something she said 30 years ago.  In the South.  Remember the...  A Southern woman 30 years ago.  Remember the time where it didn't matter what the fuck you did?  Ah, that's great.  Before you got the job?  The only people, by the way, who have stuck up for her.  Besides, of course, the radio show, are black people. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And fucking...  There was one black food network...  Why are they sticking up for her?  Because they know the...  Even they think it's ridiculous.  Hopefully they've had enough of fucking white phoniness.  Sharpton stuck up for her.  Yeah, we got the audio.  Sharpton had his own agenda.  But I'm saying at least, you know...  What do you mean?  What was his own...  His own agenda is how the fuck is he going to get on the news and criticize and want  her to have some kind of punishment for something she did said 30 years ago when he's got fucking 
[00:38:30]  a graveyard of skeletons from 30 years ago.  You know what?  But he still did.  I know what you mean, though.  I'm a stupid man.  That's right.  Of course that.  Because I was confused.  I'm like, Reverend Al is sticking up for Paula Deen because he goes after everybody else  for their little slips.  He knew he'd be targeted.  So he had to fucking come out and say...  He had no choice.  Yes, no choice.  But he had no fucking choice.  He's in Teflon with that stuff.  Like, none of those things have...  He's a master of deflection.  He's like...  And it's because he's black, but...  Oh, yeah.  That helps.  But he's also good at... 
[00:39:00]  He has not had to pay for that at all.  No.  Amazing.  Every time that comes up, he gets at you.  Amazing.  So I like the fact that he's stuck up for it all.  All right.  Why don't we listen to Reverend Al, then?  Sure.  His comments on Paula Deen.  Paula Deen.  She apologized this weekend.  Do you think she's done enough to regain her dignity and her brand back?  Well, I mean, I think that it was not just her saying that she used racial language.  A lot of us have, in the past, said things we have regretted saying years ago. 
[00:39:30]  Of course.  I think she has a lawsuit now about activities now, whether it was discriminatory  and whether or not she's engaged in things now.  It's not about her past and whether she's regained it.  I don't know.  I think they're still in litigation.  But she deserves a break?  I mean, she deserves what's fair.  But that's based on what she's engaged in now.  There's an active lawsuit now.  So I think you cannot deal with what is fair. 
[00:40:00]  Not fair until we see the outcome of the present circumstances she's accused of, not something  20 years ago.  I get it.  Oh, he didn't really do anything.  He was fucking skiing around all sorts of shit there.  He's excusing her for things that she said in the past because everybody says things in  the past.  That's because, back to your point, that they would go after him for the same fucking thing.  But he has to add, well, but what about the stuff she's doing right now? 
[00:40:30]  So he's still hanging her out to dry as far as...  And what is the stuff she's doing right now?  Whatever lawsuits are against her right now.  The sexual harassment?  Not a sexual harassment.  Some work environment shit.  Harassment, yeah.  Just harassment.  What was what?  I don't know.  Does anyone know?  It's got something to do with something work environment, like an unpleasant work environment.  Yeah, yeah, I think some...  Yeah, she would go around saying racial shit.  It's going to be a disgruntlet.  It's a disgruntlet.  Things like that, yeah.  But even though Sharpton had his own motives, I do...  I still like how he handled that because he still could have thrown her under the bus 
[00:41:00]  more.  Yeah, no choice.  I'm with Anthony on this one.  He couldn't throw her under the bus.  Yeah, no fucking choice.  He could not throw her under the bus.  And it bothers him to the point, that's why he said now a million fucking times because  he wanted to say a lot there.  Of course he did.  I'll tell you why he could have.  Because he's mad.  No one has been able to nail him with that stuff.  In all these years, and it's just farther and farther.  But it's because he does things like this.  And Jimmy, as soon as he does that, they pull out all the fucking tape.  Somebody will.  Yeah.  Somebody will, even if it's a dumb internet show. 
[00:41:30]  Like, oh, Reverend Al, remember when you said this about the Jews?  Here's your fucking speech during the Crown Heights problem.  Like, they would fucking nail him on what he said in the past.  So he's like, eh, that doesn't matter.  But she...  And here's how I fucking translate it.  Like, oh, she's a fucking racist.  Right.  And what she's saying now is just as bad as the past.  Fuck the past thing.  We don't even need to bring that up.  Here's what she does now, and she's a piece of shit.  That's what Reverend Al says.  Fuck Reverend Al and his ass. 
[00:42:00]  The key there was him saying now a lot.  Right.  That's him being fully fucking aware of his past and how this somehow can bring back some  of that old shit.  Yeah.  No, I think...  I disagree.  I think it was...  Wow.  Even though, believe me, I hate him.  How do you have faith in him?  I don't.  I only like that one moment.  And it's not that I don't think that his past would come up, but no one has been able  to nail him with it.  And Hannity has played it.  Everyone's played it.  Nobody cares what he said 20 years ago. 
[00:42:30]  Because he's black.  Because he's black.  And because he's Sharpton.  Everybody knows and nobody cares.  This one's a little close to what he went through.  Yeah.  A little too close, I think.  You know?  Yeah.  A little too close.  Oh, I'm Rivernell.  Yeah, fuck Rivernell.  Go Rivernell.  Look at him.  I'll be honest.  That's the first time I heard the clip.  I was surprised when I heard that he was speaking up.  So they bring him out commenting on the Zimmerman trial and stuff, too.  So, you know.  You're missing...  He's got that.  You're missing the horror show, though. 
[00:43:00]  What's that?  I was watching Anderson Cooper last night, and they had the whole George Zimmerman, you  know, discussion.  Uh-huh.  And they had Marsha Clark on there.  Oh, God.  Anderson Cooper said, Marsha Clark, so what do you think?  I'm like, I've been watching Marsha Clark for the last ten minutes?  You didn't know it was her?  Holy fuck!  Holy fuck!  What'd she look like?  Maybe we can find a clip from last night there, Sam.  That'd be great.  I couldn't believe that was Marsha Clark.  It was last night. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know if they got a clip up there already.  Day one, F-bomb and knock-knock joke.  That's what you get.  Wraps it right up, doesn't it?  That's ridiculous.  No.  Very good, Sam.  No.  Very good visual joke there, Sam.  No.  Nope, that's not it.  Ah, whatever.  All right.  We'll find it.  I couldn't believe it was her.  She's had some shit done.  Oh, yeah.  Good or bad.  Will work? 
[00:44:00]  Unrecognizable.  Just like, kind of, kind of just bloated face.  Whoa.  Just squeezing all her features away.  Love that.  That's what happens when you gain a little weight.  It squeezes all your features away.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just find it fucking ridiculous what they report, what they don't report.  And it will make people angry.  If, which I think, I still believe Zimmerman's going to be acquitted.  And then all hell breaks loose. 
[00:44:30]  All hell breaks loose because the media will not portray this in an honest light.  They have an agenda as they broadcast this.  Right.  And, and if people only feed off of the news, they're going to have a lot of questions as  to why he was acquitted if, if he is, again, as I said.  But you can't get one fucking guy on TV to discuss this.  What about Fox?  Fox, are they discussing it a little more honestly?  Uh, no, you know, they're all about sound bites too. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  So, you know, no one really, and fucking Nancy Grace.  That guy is good.  Oh my God.  She's on her show crying her eyes out.  What?  About, for Trayvon's mom.  Watch this.  Turn this up.  Turn this up.  It's great.  But I'm going to, it's great.  I'm going to start dry heaving though.  You're on TV.  I was speaking as a mother.  Look at her.  Look at her.  If I had heard my son cry out like that. 
[00:45:30]  Gene, what happened in the courtroom?  Look at these babbling cunts.  And I think they just started it.  Sabrina Fulton, who I saw Nancy, had been shaking.  Can it, can it, I mean, through the prosecution's opening, I just saw her shaking.  The only thing I want to say is like, you know, that would be a great moment if it was  real.  Uh-huh.  She's such a fucking phony.  That's why it's so disgusting.  She's a phony load of shit.  If that was some real emotion from a mother, all right, fine, I'll give it to you. 
[00:46:00]  But you just know that she's a phony and that she does this shit to get people to watch.  And by the way, let me also say something.  The prosecution is brilliant in this case, in what they did with this situation that Nancy  Grace is crying over.  They have a 911 call that someone made, a neighbor, when they heard a ruckus going on  outside.  In the background of the 911 call, through the person's phone in the house, you hear, 
[00:46:30]  help, help, you hear someone yelling help.  This has been argued since day one of this case.  Right.  Who is yelling help?  The defense says it's absolutely George Zimmerman.  He was being assaulted, and before he finally shot Trayvon, he was yelling help, help, help.  Other people have said it's Trayvon yelling help.  Meanwhile, why would he be yelling help if he's bashing George's face in right up until  he gets shot?  Whatever. 
[00:47:00]  They had experts from both sides that were determining who said it through voice analysis  and whatnot.  It was so inconclusive that the judge ruled, we're not having these experts testify.  The jury will never see these experts.  And they just can't figure out who it is.  They can't.  There's no way to figure it out.  Wow.  No way.  Wow.  The voice is so strained and stressed, and it's through a phone coming through a building  over 911 recording.  There's no way to tell.  We don't live in this CSI TV world. 
[00:47:30]  So, the judge even said, no, we're not having these experts testify as to who this is.  Either side, I guess, can claim who it is, but there's no expert testimony.  Wow.  So, yesterday, they play the tape in front of the jury.  You hear the, help, help, help.  Trayvon's mother gets up in front of the jury crying and leaves the courtroom.  Now, the jury will assume that she knows it's her son.  She knows her son's voice.  And fucking, now they'll be like, oh, it's got to be her son on the tape. 
[00:48:00]  She left in tears.  It's brilliant.  That is brilliant.  It's a brilliant way to make the jury think it's Trayvon without having expert testimony.  That's great.  It's brilliant.  What a smart move.  And you damn well know the prosecution talked to Trayvon's mom and said, ah, when we play  this, why don't you get up and, you know, if you're, they maybe not even said it like  that.  They probably went, if you're feeling a little emotional, you could get up and leave the  jury will see that.  They will see it.  Why don't we just ask George Zimmerman? 
[00:48:30]  He knows.  Of course he does.  He was there.  Why don't we just ask him?  He said it was him.  He officially said it was him.  He officially said it was him.  Imagine if they played it and then Zimmerman walked out too and then him and the mother just  walked out together, both crying.  Uh, uh, so that's what Nancy Grace now is talking about and she's crying and, and, and  reporting that it was Trayvon screaming.  She should know better.  She should be a little more open to the fact that it's inconclusive and report that it's 
[00:49:00]  inconclusive.  You fuck.  All right, let's play it out here.  Nancy Grace makes me dry heat when I see her on TV.  She's really tough to look at.  I really hate her.  I really hate her so quickly and a lady pastor who is there behind her got up immediately  and followed her.  And I heard the pastor say to the deputy, is she okay?  The pastor came back in.  Sabrina Fulton did not come back in that courtroom before lunch.  Jay Gasar is joining me there in the field. 
[00:49:30]  And listen, people, we're just in opening statements.  I got to hear the evidence before I make a call on this.  But I do know this.  You're already making a call.  If I had heard my son crying out like this on a 911 call, I don't know if I could have  stood up to leave the courtroom.  Listen to what this jury heard.  It sounds like a male.  And you don't know why?  I don't know why.  I think they're yelling help, but I don't know.  Send someone quick.  Say, stop. 
[00:50:00]  Okay.  Does he look hurt?  He can't see him.  I can't see him.  I don't want to go out there.  I don't know what's going on.  They're sending him.  Wow.  You know what?  I can't believe they can't figure out who that is because that's really important.  That's a whale.  Very important.  That's really fucking important.  Very important.  Yep.  And they just can't figure it out.  No.  And there's no other, like, tapes of that.  No, that was from 9-1-1.  From 9-1-1, Saul.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I understand.  But from somewhere else or... 
[00:50:30]  Wow, that's really important.  Because it's so out of the register of anybody's normal speech pattern.  Right.  So you need that sample.  It's just a weird...  Holy fuck, that's too bad they can't figure that out.  And it's been through so many different cycles of phone recording that you're going to get some kind of a bastardized version of it.  So, yeah, you know, that's why the judge said, no, we're not going to have your experts come in and testify.  Because obviously, when you get these experts, they're paid experts. 
[00:51:00]  So the prosecution will pay experts to come in and say that it was Trayvon.  Right.  The prosecution, the defense, will have paid experts that will say it was George Zimmerman.  And all it does is throw more confusion in for the jury.  So...  I got an idea.  Yeah.  Can we take George Zimmerman's dinner plate away and he'll start wailing and then they could kind of...  You want to...  I'm hungry!  And then they could kind of compare to see if it was him or...  I'm hungry!  Help!  Food! 
[00:51:30]  That was a wailing help.  Holy fuck, did he gain a lot of weight.  And where's he getting the big man suits?  Yeah.  And it is...  Big and tall.  It is true that...  And this will come out in later testimony when they start interviewing the cops that were on the scene.  George Zimmerman did, in his statement, first cops that came up, when he was running through what happened, he said,  I was yelling help, help, during that part.  So that happened...  That was told to the police right after this happened.  Right.  So a lot of things... 
[00:52:00]  Oh, Jesus.  By the way, a lot of things that are in George Zimmerman's initial statement line up with the evidence.  Right.  Uh, that was collected at the scene.  Right.  Uh, the statements that were made to police.  There's none of these huge holes in his story, uh, that really can bust it apart.  Again, I'm not fucking siding with George Zimmerman on this.  I'm telling you what the evidence is that the jury's gonna hear.  Not with the emotion in there, and not with fucking knock-knock, and they said the F-word during the trial. 
[00:52:30]  This is what the jury is hearing.  And based on that, the prosecution has a very, very difficult time, regardless of dumb knock-knock jokes and using the F-word, of proving that this is second-degree murder.  And, and George Zimmerman has a very viable self-defense case here.  That's what, uh...  Alright.  That's what I'm seeing.  Wonderful.  Will he testify?  I...  You know what?  He has to.  He very well might testify in this case. 
[00:53:00]  He has to.  He's not, he's not one of these witnesses that has anything to hide, really.  He, it's not like they could bust out this, um, earth-shattering TV-style questioning that's gonna trip him up.  All he has to do is follow his statements.  Mm-hmm.  Follow his statements.  And he has to let them know him as a person.  Doesn't look like Marsha Clark at all.  Thanks to someone on Twitter.  Sure, but, but the hair is now black, too, on top of this.  Yeah?  Oh.  Yeah, she has black hair.  It was black back in the day.  Glock guy 45. 
[00:53:30]  What?  Wasn't it black back in the day, Marsha Clark?  Then she got that afro?  Yeah, it was, it was black.  It was, like, dark.  Yeah, yeah, she got...  Wait, how did she used to look?  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah, okay.  O.J. Days, right, right.  No, now it's jet black, but, okay, I see what you're saying.  She was sporting the Sam Roberts before Sam.  Yeah, but she is unrecognized.  There you go.  She looks like Lady Di.  Yeah, that's sort of what she looked like last night.  It's like Lady Di, if Lady Di actually fixed herself up.  Wow, she's got a lot of work done.  Yeah, she's got a bit of a frozen face, too. 
[00:54:00]  If she hasn't had work done, she's just eating a lot.  Yeah.  Ladies out there, listen to us.  The Botox thing makes your fucking face look frozen.  I don't have that shit.  Turn you over and fuck you for the back.  They don't have that shit figured out yet, man.  Yeah.  Fucking relax on that shit.  Yeah.  All right.  That's your break.  I guess Marc Maron had to come to New York for something, and he's going to stop on by  and see us as well today.  Very cool.  Very good.  And there was something else. 
[00:54:30]  Michael Jackson died four years ago today?  Four years?  That's four years already?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Hey, Christ.  That's crazy.  It is crazy.  And one more plug for our podcast, because the feedback on episode number six has been  off the charts.  Oh, huge.  People are loving the 8-track porn.  They loved it.  They say it's beyond hilarious, and you get to hear Patrice O'Neill again.  And, of course, Scott Thorson, who is Liberace's ex-lover there. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And then the Opie and Anthony Nugget, but most important, the 8-track porn is killing  on this week's podcast.  They're loving it.  And if you subscribe now, then you'll get that one, plus tomorrow morning, the new one  just pops up.  Come on.  A brand new Opie and Anthony podcast, about an hour, hour and 15 minutes every week.  Here's the podcast.  Do you like it?  Do you like it?  Isn't it great?  Every Wednesday morning, it's available, the new episode.  Yeah.  We're thinking about maybe doing Dave Rabbit and his Vietnam radio tapes. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  We got that suggestion on my Facebook page.  It's not a bad one.  And then you came up with one.  What was the one you said?  What did you say, Sam?  I'm thinking for tomorrow's, we have Dave Rabbit, and we have the Tony Danza line.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Wasn't that great, people, right?  Don't you love it?  Did that bit make you happy?  Hey, I've failed if you're not happy, Sam. 
[00:56:00]  Fuck yeah, we got to do that.  Oh, we used to fuck with the Tony Danza line.  Anthony.  Anthony mostly, certainly.  What a load of fun that was.  That horrendous show.  Tony Danza.  An extravadanza.  Extravadanza.  Oh, that show stunk.  They got to keep shows like that on TV, though.  I know.  We have nothing to make fun of these days.  No.  Especially not E-Rock, who's so sharply dressed today.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Wait, it looks good. 
[00:56:30]  Weird, right?  We got to talk about that, but we got to take a break.  I already started eating.  You got to talk about that?  Fucking women.  He goes fucking women.  But he doesn't understand our perspective on this shit.  Why doesn't he understand our perspective?  You think this is dressed up?  He's trying to divert.  It's the first time you've worn a collared shirt in here.  Yes.  Exactly.  No.  He knows what he did.  He's trying to divert.  Exactly.  All right.  We'll get into it next.  Oh, yeah.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:57:00]  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body.  I know not everybody has got a body like you.  But I got to think twice before I give my heart away. 
[00:57:30]  And I know all the games you play because I play them too.  How many years ago was the first time George Michael was sucking cock in the bathroom?  I don't know why he's playing this. 
[00:58:00]  I don't know why he's playing this.  Yeah.  Maybe he just likes it.  Oh, it's his birthday today.  Oh, duh.  Stupid me.  He's 50 today.  50?  George Michael.  I just saw Chris Rock.  He's 50.  Yeah.  Big star in the building.  Some shit's going on today.  This is big today.  Are we allowed to say what's going on today?  I don't know.  Well, I think so.  Yeah.  He kind of talked about it last week.  Oh, yeah.  When he was in here. 
[00:58:30]  Chris Rock is filming part of his new movie here at Sirius XM today.  Yeah.  I don't want to give any details about the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're going to be part of it for probably five seconds.  They're filming us.  Yeah.  They're going to film us interviewing his character in our studio.  Right.  Yeah.  So he's going to come in later on after the show today.  And, you know, they'll have all their cameras and lights and all that happy horse shit.  And we'll be like, hey, what up? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  What up, guy that's not Chris Rock?  Hey.  And then what?  They go into shade.  And they do it there.  And then they go into, like, Al Q.  And they do it there.  And they go into.  Yeah.  And then they cut it all together.  So there'll be, like, one of us at some point going, so, character name, guy, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  Tell us about your new movie.  Is that what you're going to be thinking?  Like, okay, I've got to ask a question that they can splice in.  None of this conversation bullshit.  No.  Oh, fuck no.  It's got to be the sound bites.  It's all about sound bites.  Knock, knock. 
[00:59:30]  That'll be mine.  All right.  Jackie.  Yay.  How are you doing?  Oh, thank you.  Jackie.  Jackie, Jackie.  Look at that.  Just like I asked for.  Perfect.  Yes, you put it right in the right area.  Oh, more stuff.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Come on, Jackie.  Oh, I was bringing coffee.  What?  It's our intern, man.  I did that for like a year and a half.  Nice and hot.  Just the way I like it. 
[01:00:00]  We've got a new attitude around here, Sam.  What's wrong with you?  Get on board.  Don't be a hater.  Really?  Why are you a hater, man?  Pizza garbage.  Turning things around around this joint.  Really?  I had shit thrown at me.  She didn't throw me at me.  Right.  Yay.  Well, you should have.  Exactly.  You've been doing it back to us for the last eight years.  You rock.  Well, speaking of the movie shoot.  Well, yeah.  We all were kind of told to maybe, you know, like dress a little better than usual, so. 
[01:00:30]  I totally ignored that.  I noticed that.  I'm wearing exactly what I wear every day.  Why would I do anything different?  Because you just got a logo on your shirt.  No, but I have a shirt to cover it up.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  They said no logos.  Oh, they did.  I almost wore seven.  No logos.  But this is like, it's nothing.  You won't see this.  Right.  It's fine.  I think it's fine.  And, well, obviously, it's Opie, I, Jim Norton. 
[01:01:00]  Is that how you say that?  I don't know.  Technically, it would be Opie, Jim Norton, and I.  And I, yeah.  Well, I was just doing it because I'm, you know, here.  Why didn't you say me there?  I don't know.  Wait, if you'd say it would be, you know, you'd say Opie, Jim Norton, and me.  But what if he said it the way he said it?  Then it would be grammatically incorrect.  Then we all think he's an ass like we do.  No, I don't even think he's an ass.  I hate that me-eye thing.  I'm just like, it's me, Opie, and Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[01:01:30]  That's what it is.  There you go.  Yeah.  So that's, you know, but I guess some people came in knowing that this was going to happen  and assumed that if they dress the part, and, you know.  I love how you have a whole story and scenario in your head.  How do you know we're talking about you?  No one was listening, going to break, hearing what this shit was going on.  Will you let Anthony finish, please?  I can't even see what he's wearing. 
[01:02:00]  It's a shirt.  It's a plain shirt with a collar on it.  Well, I got a movie that, wait, wait.  Who's that?  We need to get him in the movie.  Oh, no.  Sam, what's going on?  It's exactly like yours, Jim.  Oh, right.  It's just something you would never.  Sam, what's going on?  Well, break it down.  This morning, I was diligently working, and Travis said,  Sam, did you see what E-Rock is wearing today?  And I said, is it a wrestling shirt or a Doctor Who shirt? 
[01:02:30]  Because that's his usual wear.  Right.  It's his uniform.  We all have uniforms.  Sure, sure.  Yes.  There's nothing wrong with that.  No.  And, uh...  Of course not.  It's his uniform.  Look at Jimmy.  I love it.  No one gets a fucking break around here.  You can't even dress nice for a movie without being ridiculed.  No.  Just constant ridicule.  Travis, let me know.  Of course.  You got to look at what E-Rock's wearing.  Can I ask you a question, Sam?  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Did it become a bit of a buzz around the joint?  Oh, yes.  Before 6 a.m., which is crazy.  A bit of a buzz.  You can't get a buzz going before 6 a.m. right here.  Everyone's just miserable and tired, but there was a buzz in the hallway?  Yeah.  It was me.  It was Travis.  It was Sal.  Everybody just figured out, look, what's he going for here?  What's he angling for?  And what do you think?  The same thing everyone else here is angling for.  Everybody's wearing what they wear every day except you.  Yeah.  Because you wear that dress-up denim shirt all the time. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, shit.  Roland wears pants all the time.  Oh, fuck.  It's not a dress-up denim shirt.  It's the same shirt Jim's made fun of multiple times on the air.  So, yes, I do wear it all the time.  Oh, wow.  There's actually a record of it being referenced.  I've seen that shirt a thousand times.  It's not a special shirt.  But now, E-Rock.  So, you're going through this.  I love the smile on your face with this.  He loves it.  I love it.  Don't lick your lips.  It's so fun.  So, E-Rock, what was your thinking when you left? 
[01:04:00]  It's so fun.  What was your thinking?  Right.  What was your thinking, Big Shot?  Well, there's something going on here today, so maybe I shouldn't look like a total piece  of shit and go for a partial piece of shit by wearing just a plain collared shirt.  Plain collared shirt.  You think there might have been a thought that, like, well, you know, sometimes during,  what if, you know, in the movie, they need somebody to come in and, like, take a photo.  And you can talk about your movie.  No.  That's true.  You can start a little conversation about two filmmakers. 
[01:04:30]  Or what if I'm having some small talk in the hallway, maybe?  What if all Chris Rock's character is in here?  One of you goes, our producer didn't bring us the prep sheet.  Oh, wow.  And then E-Rock comes in.  Mr. Fabasham!  Get Sal in here.  I'm sure he's enjoying this, too.  Oh, yeah.  Are you saying he's hoping for a cameo?  Yes.  He is hoping for a cameo. 
[01:05:00]  Do you think he'll be good?  Oh, no.  Walking in the door.  No.  Your prep sheet is here.  Sal, what's going on today?  I hear there's a buzz in the hallway.  About what?  E-Rock's shirt.  Oh, yeah.  So how did it go down this morning?  Everyone knows about it.  Well, I mean, E-Rock only gets dressed up, like, when he's got to go out for dinner or  something like that.  He's wearing a nice shirt today.  Or when he's going to make his Hollywood debut.  He looks good, though. 
[01:05:30]  He looks well put together.  I can't really see.  E-Rock, could you come in here for a second?  I haven't seen this shirt.  It's weird to see him in a collared shirt.  That's a fresh shirt, by the way.  Is it fresh?  He bought that yesterday.  No.  Just for this?  Check for fog marks.  Yeah, it looks pretty sharp.  Just for the...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, that's a really nice collared shirt.  What do you got, a black shirt under it?  Double shirts, motherfucker. 
[01:06:00]  That is nice, I gotta say.  Oh, wait a minute.  Look who's clean shaven.  E-Rock, and your hair is...  You've done your hair today.  My hair's always like that.  I don't know.  Sometimes it's blonde.  I haven't worn that hat in several months.  Okay.  And sometimes the hair is blonde.  Yeah.  For the summer.  That's been two years.  Fresh shaven.  He's always got a little stubble.  Yeah.  Someone's ready to be discovered.  Are you...  Oh.  Jim Norden. 
[01:06:30]  Are you returning the shirt after today?  Is the tag still on it?  Yeah.  You know, Cary Grant was a soda jerk.  That's right.  Yeah, when he was discovered, Gregory Peck was an usher in a movie theater.  Right.  He was discovered.  What about here?  Get E-Rock some tequila so he can fight back.  Oh, my God.  Was there a little thought that, like, you know, I might end up walking in on the shot?  No.  We need a producer character. 
[01:07:00]  I didn't want to look like a total piece of shit.  Who can we get?  Who can we get?  You're like Lucy with Desi trying to be in the show.  Of course.  I haven't said a word about trying to do anything with this.  No saying needed, sir.  I'm so glad Mars said, fuck the Hollywood movie fucking shoot today.  I mean, the same shirt I got.  The exact same fucking shirt for Mars today.  And could I have a...  Could Jackie or someone bring me a napkin?  Preferably Jackie, because she seems to do it well.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's just write what you need.  Boom.  Yeah.  Write in.  Write in.  A few napkins. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, I didn't see it.  Oh, that is...  Thanks, Sam.  So you got...  Oh, Sam.  Maybe we need a producer in the studio at some point.  Yeah, because what difference would it make if somebody looked like a total piece of shit  in a different room?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  If they're not in the room.  A guy wants to comment.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  On E-Rock's tweets.  Oh.  What's wrong with E-Rock's tweets?  I'm not going to beat him up for his tweets.  He does fine.  Where is he?  Ah, the phone might be frozen. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Yay!  Jackie.  Hey, Jackie.  It's a napkin.  Home run, Jackie.  Perfect.  Once again, home run.  I gave them to you already.  Thank you, Jackie.  What?  These are soft.  Yeah, no, those are better napkins.  I got to blow my nose.  Those are better napkins, Sam.  You can tell.  You can tell they're better.  They're softer.  They've got great hair.  It looks very 60s-ish.  Oh, E-Rock?  No, no.  But E-Rock does have great hair.  It really does.  I still have my hair, yeah.  I know.  It's fucking, like, nice.  Thick head of hair.  My kid. 
[01:08:30]  It's fucking Sam.  What?  Don't fucking Sam me.  This is a room full of people.  One of us is honest, though.  I'm being totally honest, but other people are making something out of nothing.  No, no, no.  I wasn't talking about you not being honest.  I was talking about me being honest about having a great time here.  Uh-huh.  Did you do anything before you left the house this morning with the thought that there was  going to be a camera crew in here today?  Yes, that's why I wore the shirt.  Okay.  Now, why would you do that? 
[01:09:00]  You're in a dark room.  Because this never happens here, so I didn't want to look like I usually do.  Well, what would it matter?  Wouldn't you want to present yourself nicely every day?  Because in the end...  Wouldn't you?  Because...  Wouldn't you?  What does it matter?  Unless you would think you're on camera.  But you don't dress nice every day.  I don't give a flying...  It's obvious.  I look exactly like I do every day.  I think the difference would be that Jim and Anthony and Opie are going to be on camera.  We'll be on camera.  So the idea is they would dress nice...  If you're saying that they are dressed more nicely than usual, it's because they're going  to be on camera. 
[01:09:30]  In Iraq, we see nobody and we do dress okay.  You are walking around with these assholes all day long.  So why wouldn't you dress nice in case, you know, it helps your fucking...  Your fucking career.  Because it ain't going to help here.  Why...  Why then?  Knowing you probably...  Not probably...  I already said why.  You're not going to be on camera.  Why would you get dressed any different?  You never know, though.  He's hoping for one of those moments.  You want a moment?  You need a thing brought in, yeah.  Were you hoping for a moment?  Do you have somebody that could bring Chris in and like sit him down at the... 
[01:10:00]  You know.  No.  Chris.  Take a seat.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Coffee.  Mmm.  Yeah.  Coffee.  Oh, you bring...  Oh.  Bring a coffee.  We need someone to bring a coffee into Chris's character during the interview.  Was that what you were hoping for?  This is a plain shirt.  It's not like I dressed up in a suit or something like that.  Well, no.  But you consciously...  You need a cup of coffee?  There's no way. 
[01:10:30]  There you are.  Wow.  Enjoy it.  That would be a good one.  See, Travis didn't dress up.  Who's the coffee guy in that movie?  Yeah.  Travis has got a logo shirt on.  Fucking Spielberg will be sitting there.  Yeah.  The coffee guy in the Chris Rock movie.  I've been looking.  Oh.  The best part of all this is that the entire crew that's with Chris Rock, they're all wearing  T-shirts.  Right.  Guy outside's got a flame shirt and shorts on.  Yes. 
[01:11:00]  I've been reincarnated.  Well, it's because none of them are hoping to get on camera.  So you're saying they're all okay being behind the scenes?  Yes.  Oh.  Firok, you just...  There was an inkling.  It's like, look.  It might happen.  Yeah, it might.  I better dress appropriately.  You never know.  Who knows?  You never know.  There is no other reason.  I hope he just starts laughing.  He's like...  You never know.  Well, I like when he's honest.  Yeah.  I do. 
[01:11:30]  I like that he started by saying it's the same thing everybody did.  Everybody's just dressed like they always dress.  There's no difference.  Everybody's wearing the same shirt.  Sal's wearing one of his terrible V-neck shirts.  Oh, man.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Sam's got a shirt that I've seen a thousand times.  Do you know who looks great today?  Jackie.  I thought you were going to say...  Really?  So, if Chris Rock...  I haven't seen her yet.  If Chris Rock comes in and says, his character says, hey, do we have any coffee in here?  Oh, man.  Who's going to bring in the coffee? 
[01:12:00]  Where's my cup of coffee?  Is there anybody really well-dressed that can bring Chris's character some coffee?  There he is.  But the question is, will Jackie get the part?  Oh, man.  Yeah, who do you want?  Jackie or you?  Jackie would still get the part.  How pissed would collared shirt Eric be if Jackie got the part?  Well, he's got a t-shirt underneath, too, just in case.  Because they may say, we want a more casual look.  Could you come to work tomorrow with a few different looks?  We need different looks.  Do you think...  He just takes it and goes, ridiculous. 
[01:12:30]  Do you think that Eric tried on a couple different undershirts to see what color were gray and white?  You absolutely put on a couple of things, took it off, was like, no.  No, because I'm not a girl.  I didn't imply that, but you're a guy that was very conscious of what you wanted to wear today  because this movie's being filmed.  You didn't just throw one shirt on and go, all right, I'm out of the house.  You checked, you made sure you looked and went, no, you know what?  I'm going to use this shirt. 
[01:13:00]  Or I'm going to change it to that.  Does that shirt bring out your dreamy eyes?  Bedroom eyes.  Bedroom eyes.  Do you think he gave himself a sparkle blink before he left the house in the mirror?  Sparkle, sparkle.  You're dressed up more than everyone else.  Oh, you're jacking off in front of the mirror like Dirk Diggler.  Come on.  Yeah.  No, yeah, he just stood up and he looked at himself.  What did he say before he left?  He's ready to go.  Showtime. 
[01:13:30]  You're a star.  You're a star.  You're a fucking star.  You're a fucking star.  You're a fucking star.  E-Rock's saying he's not dressed up.  I've never seen you clean-shaven, I don't think.  That's true.  Because you grow that shit.  Nine years, never.  You grow that shit in hours.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's hard to keep it clean-shaven.  No, I'm serious.  Once a week.  And I've never seen you in a collared shirt.  Maybe outside here.  Maybe at my wedding or something.  Right.  But I don't know.  I don't really remember the last time I saw you with a collared shirt.  Exactly.  I wanted to see you in one collared shirt made out of rope. 
[01:14:00]  Just kidding.  It looks like he might have got a facial, but...  Did you get a facial?  You are very fresh-faced today.  Yeah, your face is so fresh right now.  You think you went one showers and shaves in the morning?  Well...  Oh, so you don't...  No, you usually don't shower.  You don't shower and shave in the morning.  We've seen...  I shower in the morning.  I've seen you a little more grubby.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm very lazy with shaving.  It's once a week.  Not today, though.  Not today.  Yeah, you're a shaved kid.  Made sure today.  I didn't shave today.  I shaved yesterday.  No.  No, fuck that.  I'm starring in the movie. 
[01:14:30]  Very good question.  Very good question coming in.  Yes.  If you want to put your headphones on.  I'm sorry that we're going to mess up your hair before the big...  The big shoot, but...  You could use that in your character.  You've been doing radio all day.  Look how he's using...  He's never used his headphones like that.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want to mess that hair up.  He's been in radio for 17 years, and he won't put the headphones on.  He won't put the headphones on.  Joe in New York.  What's up, Joe?  Well, I was just wondering, is Ebrock going to leave his new movie laying around hoping 
[01:15:00]  he gets discovered?  You got a movie laying around?  No.  Do you have a script or treatment or something?  I'm a filmmaker, too.  Let me tell you about this movie.  See?  It's going to be like Kramer with Fred Savage.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's say hi to Justin in Ohio.  Justin.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm wondering if this goes back to Ebrock's tweets last night calling Anthony an ass for  calling him an elephant, and then shortly thereafter retweeting Dane Cook saying, 
[01:15:30]  some people give you motivation to work harder to get the hell away from them.  Whoa!  Did you retweet that?  Of course I did.  Oh.  Wait, some shit went down last night?  I was just making a joke.  It wasn't the obvious.  What happened?  Like, jokes.  What did I miss?  Uh-oh.  No.  It was...  Explain this.  It was just one of those times where I'm looking at something and, oh, there's something  from Anthony, and of course, it's never good.  Oh.  It's something that had nothing to do with me.  It's the character I play.  It's the character I play. 
[01:16:00]  And there's a photo.  That's funny.  Well, when you drunkenly...  But when you drunkenly told Ant that he doesn't like you,  Ant said he did like you.  I do.  I love E-Rock.  Yeah.  It was great.  What happened, though?  Why would you do an elephant joke?  Well, because everybody, you know, makes the joke.  Because I tweeted something about elephants.  I was watching a documentary, right?  Yes, yes.  And I just put a picture of E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  And a link with no other text or anything.  It was just the picture.  But E-Rock was feeling specifically sensitive because he was trying to figure out what he was 
[01:16:30]  going to look like for his on-camera debut.  You know what I mean?  And body image issues are not something you want to struggle with.  Yeah, I know.  It was bad timing.  It was.  That's insensitive of you, Ant.  It was.  I'm outside with E-Rock on this one.  I know.  He's trying to get ready for his big movie debut.  I know.  And you were kind of being an asshole.  Fucking sad.  Big movie debut.  I'm on E-Rock's side.  Oh.  Well.  What have you got here?  She dressed up, too, huh? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  Is she looking for a part?  No.  Those dresses are not flattering.  No.  They make you look way too fucking...  Yeah, she looks like she's a fucking...  Way too wide.  It looks like she's in India.  Did she just give us the finger?  I think he's shooting with the mashup, too.  Oh, really?  Oh, so this isn't that special.  Honestly.  But that's the thing.  Like, the people...  This isn't special.  It is special.  I thought it was a little special.  No, it is special.  Not if they're filming them, too.  All you have to do is perform well, and you'll be the ones who get used.  It's talking to you, too, E-Rock.  We're all going to have, like, a split second. 
[01:17:30]  It's going to be a montage interview scene.  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  I was going to say, we're all...  Well...  You three.  Let's go to Pete in Connecticut.  Pete.  Pete.  Hey, it's Pete.  That's me, anyway.  Eric, did you have a conversation with your wife last night?  And just, hey, this is my big opportunity.  See, they get it.  Does this make me look less fat?  Oh, Jesus.  Which color is most slimming?  I bought four polos.  Was there a discussion with the wife about this? 
[01:18:00]  No.  Really?  No.  See, he doesn't give in.  I bet there was a little discussion.  He doesn't give in to the bit.  I bet there was a talk.  You think there was a little talk?  So, Chris Rock filming a movie tomorrow.  No?  No.  Didn't even talk about it?  It was like one of those, like...  Probably nothing's going to happen, but you just don't know with stuff like this.  You never know when opportunity's going to come up.  Yeah.  You know?  And he said this.  He said, and I know, like, we're both kind of in entertainment, but I'm more on the performing  side of things.  The show business side of things. 
[01:18:30]  These fucking listeners, man.  I don't think...  I swear.  I don't think there's funnier listeners for other radio shows.  They just get it.  Nick in Alabama.  Go ahead.  Hey, see if you can hook E-Rock up with one of those casting couch porno videos.  To get him into the movies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe Chris Rock's character could bust a nut on his face or something.  Oh, wow.  Now you're going too far, sir.  E-Rock does not get that picture.  It'll make him a big star. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Maybe they need, like, a voice to tell everybody in their headphones, like, coming right back.  Right.  And then the shot will go to the producer.  30 seconds, guys.  Yeah.  Fumble with the buttons.  Boom, boom, boom.  Making it all happen.  That'd be great.  You see everybody with the heads, facets, and radios out there?  Well, he's also probably thinking, he's like, you know, what if the guys have to leave  early today or something?  They don't end up shooting.  Ah, boy.  They still want to do something.  Maybe it'll be me and Jim.  Oh. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Can we get that producer kid in the air?  He's good.  No, I love the shirt.  Don't sit in the wardrobe.  The shirt's perfect.  Send him in.  Is he?  I hope he's one of the Opie and Anthony guys, right?  Well, even if he isn't, he is today.  He's perfect for the part.  Why isn't he laughing? 
[01:20:00]  That's good stuff right there.  It's too funny.  That's good stuff.  All right, lights, speed, X.  Wait a minute.  What was that?  All right, everyone, clear the set.  Bring him in.  That shirt's perfect.  He's almost smiling. 
[01:20:30]  He's almost smiling.  You can see how absurd it would be when taken to that level, right?  Absurd.  I'm sure it's perfect.  Mr. Director, does he have his own trailer?  What do we got for him?  What do we got for him?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Renee?  Renee, you want me?  Yes?  Um, could you set up a trailer for Mr. Nagel? 
[01:21:00]  No, no, the one that's bigger than the Chris's.  Yeah, that one.  No, no, don't send wardrobe in there at all.  He's perfect.  He's already got the shirt.  He thought this out.  It's obvious.  Get him the big trailer.  A honey wagon?  Get him the honey wagon.  I want him to give him the big one.  And, uh, yeah, make sure he's back up here on set, because we need him.  Do we need to get him makeup? 
[01:21:30]  Makeup?  I thought he was wearing makeup.  That fresh face is perfect.  And who put that hairpiece on him?  Because it's wonderful.  It's the exact one.  Natural, that's his?  This is unbelievable.  Hollywood has missed this patch.  Look at that smooth skin and close shave.  It's perfect.  Get him on set.  Ask him what he needs. 
[01:22:00]  You know what?  I don't even think Chris is the right person to play the lead in this movie.  I think we found our new star.  Oh, E-Rock.  Unfortunately, Tony from Brooklyn has a perfect observation.  Oh.  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately.  That's right.  You'll understand in a second.  Go ahead, Tony in Brooklyn.  Yeah, guys.  You guys, if it was the total opposite, if he didn't get dressed up, he would have came 
[01:22:30]  in normal, like his normal shit.  You guys would have been bucking his balls.  Why didn't he get dressed up?  You guys had an opportunity.  Hollywood people come in.  So, E-Rock, unfortunately, you can't win in this movie.  Are you saying the things here aren't fair, sir?  E-Rock is the definition of the no-win situation.  That's right.  Yes, he is the Kobayashi Maru.  Yes, put that on the Wikipedia page.  First of all, there's a problem.  We really need...  Why hasn't the craft service guy shown up? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, he has.  Where's all the food?  That's unfortunate.  That's unfortunate.  Oh, my goodness.  This is exciting, right?  Well, you look great, E-Rock.  You look great.  You look great.  A million bucks.  Were you surprised that a buzz picked up so early this morning?  No, because you have nothing else to do.  Oh, man.  As soon as I walked past your office, I wasn't even halfway in the hallway, and I hear this 
[01:23:30]  twink over here.  Did you know what it was about?  Of course I knew what it was about.  Because as soon as I got down here and turned around, all I see from their office is Kyle  going like this.  I was like, of course.  This is where it's going.  How cruel.  Just gesture like he's leaning around the corner to take a look.  There's just bullying going on here.  Just producing a radio show, guys.  That's right.  I understand, Travis.  Good for you.  Oh, man.  When you show up for work, camera ready, that it might come up. 
[01:24:00]  Camera ready?  I'm not, like, oblivious to that.  You are camera ready.  You're in a different room.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, people are.  There's a hustle and bustle going on here.  That's why movies are so expensive.  Right.  There's so many people involved.  Everyone's got, like, fucking radio on their hip and fucking doing things.  They're all saying, I wish you would just get out of there so we can start this movie. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, jeez.  Do you want to take more phone calls?  Oh, look who's here.  Whoa, Kenny looking very sharp.  Kenny, how are you doing?  Kenny, you look good.  There's a rumor they changed the schedule.  They might be wanting to do you guys a little earlier.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  That means less radio for us.  Call time.  Our call time is earlier?  They bumped it up?  What time?  A lot of the crew here are big fans of the show.  They're very excited.  Oh.  That's what he rocked with counting on.  Chris, you've got to use him.  This kid's good. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  What time are they thinking?  Zero, nine, thirty.  Zero, nine, thirty.  Nice.  I like it.  Eric calls the shots.  What happened?  I just saw Rich Voss.  What happened?  Voss?  Yeah.  What are you doing here, Rich?  Hey, Rich.  I thought this was a movie set I was working on.  What happened?  What are you doing here?  I thought this was a movie set I was working on.  Oh, it is.  In here?  Are you in this?  This will be part of the...  Well, I'm doing things. 
[01:25:30]  What are you doing here?  I see you've got some sides over there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm allowed to say what I'm doing.  Are you an interviewer?  No.  Are you please acting me?  Wait, no.  Wait, what are you doing here?  I'm here tomorrow.  I don't know.  But I came early.  I'm supposed to be with you guys tomorrow, but I came early.  I am so confused.  I see sides in your hand.  This is like seeing your teacher at a fucking beach or something.  Out of context.  Completely.  Huh?  I'm happy to see you, but why are you here today? 
[01:26:00]  Maybe he's writing.  Are you part of the Chris Rock thing?  What?  There's...  What's going on here with Chris Rock?  Is there something going on?  What is he doing?  We're talking about it.  Are you writing on this movie?  I'm booked to be on your show.  Tomorrow?  Are you fucking for real?  You just said tomorrow.  I can't even keep up with this.  I can't keep up with this.  Yeah, yeah.  Obviously, you're involved in the Chris Rock movie.  In what way, shape, or form?  Are you writing?  Just doing some stuff, yeah.  Writing?  Yeah? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, that's nice.  Very cool.  Now Mark Maron's here.  Look at this.  E-Rock's getting pissed.  Every guy that walks in has one less chance of him being in the movie.  E-Rock is very lucky, dressed up.  He thinks he's getting on camera.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  They don't have a wide lens.  Oh, no.  So you're helping out on the movie?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, because that's what's going on around here today.  Is that Mark?  All right.  And you're on the show tomorrow?  Our show?  Yeah, I'm on your show tomorrow.  Can you do our show today?  Huh?  I'm doing your show tomorrow because I'm at Mohegan Sun this week. 
[01:27:00]  That's why I'm doing your show tonight.  Ah.  Nice.  Cut the plug in there.  Okay.  And this week up in Hartford.  But I'm doing this thing.  Look how good Norton looks.  Thank you.  Yeah, he's very slender.  So Rich Ross is here.  Mark Maron is here.  Mark.  E-Rock in his own brand new shirt is here.  Good.  Oh, we didn't ask him if it's a brand new shirt just for today.  Uh-huh.  I bet it was.  He said it's not, but he's lying.  He's lying.  I'm just going to say it is.  Of course it is.  It is.  It is.  All right.  Why don't we do this proper?  Let's take a break, and then we're going to continue with Mark Maron.  Nice. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.P.A.  Rich Voss. 
[01:28:00]  Rich Voss hanging around.  We got Mark Maron joining the show.  Mark Maron came in here and just entertained the hell out of us.  And I'm like, Mark, you've got to do some of this for the audience, too.  My God.  I will.  We got a private show from Mark Maron.  It was terrific.  Just talking about the podcast.  And flying and all of that. 
[01:28:30]  Well, that was the thing.  I was in Buffalo, and, you know, Buffalo is an underrated city.  It gets a bad rap.  Yeah.  No.  I lived there for three years.  I did not.  I lived there for three years.  What are you talking about?  Doing radio?  Yes.  So what my feeling was.  I felt like I was in prison for three years.  It seems like there was some trouble.  And that there's some economic problems.  Some strife.  Yeah, but there's a charm to it.  The people are beaten down.  They're beaten down.  They're very pleasant.  They're broken.  Yeah, they're broken and happy. 
[01:29:00]  If I was ever close to being an alcoholic, it was when I was in Buffalo for three years.  That's how they make alcoholics.  It's made in Buffalo.  JÃ¤germeister shots was the...  That was like taking vitamins in that fucking city.  But I know I'm not in a good place where I'm driving around.  Like, I rented a car because I wanted to go to see Niagara Falls.  Nice.  And I'm driving around.  And this is how I know I'm not in a good place because I'm like, I could live here.  Oh, wow, really?  You could get a house for a nickel.  I could probably make do up here.  I could work out of my house.  Very inexpensive.  But the hotel I stayed at, it actually had the personality of a recovering heroin addict. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, you know when you walk into a place and you're like, oh, this was bad.  Something happened here.  Like the whole place has an evil vibe to it.  Right, because they redid it, but there's some of the shit you can't cover up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What hotel?  The Lafayette.  Wait, I think that's the...  It looks like a house?  No, no.  It's this huge, old, glorious place.  Oh, okay.  Never mind.  But it feels like there was a halfway house vibe and smell that you couldn't get out of there.  Like I just pictured walking down the hall to my room that at some point, some woman was running down this hallway saying, he's got a gun! 
[01:30:00]  You know?  That's Buffalo.  And a bunch of junkies were walking by going, oh, she's pissed again.  I wonder what's going on.  But they got that one street that's kind of nice.  I thought it was nice.  Sort of near downtown where all the clubs are, a few restaurants that try to make a little scene down there.  New Street's great in Buffalo, Route 90.  Because it takes you out of Buffalo.  You were there.  You didn't like the city at all?  I like Buffalo.  I like the fans.  But it's like I couldn't live there.  Everything looked like it was built in 1984 because of the weather damage it takes. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, right.  Everything has to be rebuilt.  Everything is rebuilt.  It's like Winnipeg.  God hates it.  Just crushing it with weather.  And you weren't up there during the snowy season.  No, I was beautiful.  Which is pretty much nine months of the year.  It was beautiful weather.  Okay.  And, you know, but...  But we love Buffalo.  We love our fans up there.  No, they force you.  I've never seen someone...  I've never seen a town more committed and loyal to bar food as Buffalo is.  Yay!  Thank you, Sidney.  What is that, smoothie?  Yeah.  What's wrong, Sidney? 
[01:31:00]  Our intern, Sidney.  Anthony, thanks.  You didn't even bring him anything.  What?  You know what?  It's a new day around here.  She brought a little sunshine into the room is what she did.  You're a bummer.  That's what I'm saying.  You're a bummer.  You've got to change your attitude, Sam.  You just look at things on the surface.  You don't appreciate the whole picture.  Eric's been here for, like, how long now?  Nine, ten years.  Oh, wow.  And he just got smashed for wearing a shirt with a collar on it.  And all you have to do is walk in here and be a girl, and you get a yay! 
[01:31:30]  They're wonderful.  Girls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Generally speaking.  Exactly.  It'll march.  Generally speaking.  So, Buffalo was cool to you.  Yeah.  No, I was into it.  I drove.  I went to see Niagara Falls.  I rented a car.  And when you drive to Niagara, I've never, I don't think I, maybe I was there with one  wife, but I think I erased all the memories.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, they just got, I have a vague recollection of wearing a poncho and getting wet, but that  could have been anything.  The maid of the mist is something you've got to do. 
[01:32:00]  You do, right?  I loved it.  And I don't like tourist shit.  But did you drive through Niagara?  That is the saddest fucking town.  Wow.  Like, you literally drive through four blocks of this decimated, pathetic, hopeless town to  where, you know, it's a good setup for the falls, because either you're going to  be like, thank God, or I'm going to jump the fuck in.  You'd be like, so I get to the falls, and they're not disappointing.  There's no way.  No, it's amazing.  Some sort of cynical, you've got to be a cynical fuck to stand in front of Niagara Falls and  go, I get it.  It just keeps coming.  Right?  What next?  It's pretty amazing. 
[01:32:30]  But I got very, did you go on the tunnels and stuff?  I went on the boat.  Oh, I got to go on the tunnels where you're right under the falls, looking through the falls,  basically.  Next time, next time.  All right, sorry.  But I went to, the weird thing was, is that when you go to a tourist attraction, you start  hating people immediately.  Yeah.  Just like they're there with their kids.  They're horrible.  There's nine people.  Like, how many tickets?  You don't know how many kids you have?  You know, like, and I'm just, and I'm just hating them horribly.  And then as you walk down, like, I'm filled with contempt as I'm getting on this boat. 
[01:33:00]  And then you get to the boat, and everybody gets this garbage bag blue poncho.  So now everybody's wearing these fucking garbage bags.  And I'll tell you, man, you're on a boat with a hundred people wearing garbage bags?  It's hard to hate people.  Because y'all look ridiculous, right?  So there's almost like a great equalizer.  It's a garbage bag.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, but I was amazed at it.  That's what the world needs.  We just, if we all walked around with garbage bags.  When there's a problem, put people in a garbage bag.  Everybody look at yourself.  And everyone will calm the fuck down.  Right.  But it was nice, and you take the garbage bag off, and you're right back to fuck these people. 
[01:33:30]  But I, you know, but I did get stuck in Buffalo, and all I wanted to do was get home.  Yeah.  And it was horrible, because it was a nice day.  I thought I had it made.  I had to get home.  I had the 400th podcast went up yesterday.  My 400th anniversary.  Congratulations.  It's a big deal.  That is a big deal.  That's a lot of podcasts.  And I had Iggy Pop on.  I'd already recorded the interview, which was kind of hilarious, because I was nervous about that.  I love that guy.  And, you know, I didn't know if he was cognizant, or whether he could talk, or, you know, what he was about. 
[01:34:00]  And it was kind of weird, because I'm waiting for him to come.  One limo comes.  It's a publicist.  And she's, you know, she's got heels on.  She gets out.  I walk her into my garage.  I'm like, can he talk?  Is he all right?  She's like, yeah, he loves talking.  I'm like, fine.  So then another limo pulls up, and Iggy's road manager gets out.  His seven-foot girlfriend gets out.  And he's about to get out.  And I'm standing there.  I'm like, hey, how you doing, Iggy?  You need anything?  You need anything?  He goes, I need to refresh.  And I'm like, I don't know what that means.  Do you need coffee?  Yeah, coffee.  Black.  Great.  Fine.  I got that.  Do you need water?  Water's good.  But I need to refresh. 
[01:34:30]  And I'm like, okay.  I'm not sure what that is.  So we walk out to the back deck.  And Iggy just starts, like, he's standing there.  And there's, like, these four people he brought with him.  And he's, like, stretching on my deck.  And he's like, this is nice.  And he's looking.  He's almost doing, like, a weird dance.  And then within two minutes.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Then within two minutes, the fucking shirt comes off.  And I'm like, anyone else?  That would be like, what is going on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just getting into Iggy.  So then we go in to the garage.  I'm sitting there with a shirtless Iggy in my garage talking to him.  And it didn't make any difference to me at all. 
[01:35:00]  There was a couple of points where he just started tweaking his nipple a little bit.  And it was a little weird.  Yeah.  But I didn't bring it up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I didn't know if he was trying to.  I understand that from both of your points of view, actually.  Wow.  He's a strange guy.  No, but it was a great chat.  Yeah.  Why does he have to take his shirt off always?  He loves it.  You know, he's an animal.  I don't think I've ever seen him with a shirt on.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't take his shirt off alone.  He's got to be like 70.  And he's about five feet tall.  He's like five foot two.  Is he a small guy?  Yeah, he's tremendous. 
[01:35:30]  You know, just like seven foot tall, Asian, huge boobs.  Wow.  Yeah, he's doing fine.  Yeah.  But the panic was I needed to get back from Buffalo to L.A.  And they canceled my flight, American, because it was a mechanical problem.  And then you're sort of like, well, is there another flight?  No, that's it.  There's no more leaving from us.  You cannot leave.  Yeah, so then I rebook on Delta through American with my Platinum status.  I'm like, you don't fucking understand them.  Platinum, take care of me.  They rebook me on Delta through Detroit.  It leaves in like two hours.  I'm like, great.  Ten minutes after they book me on Delta through American, Delta calls me on the phone with an 
[01:36:00]  automated call saying that the one out of Buffalo's delayed two hours.  The one out of Detroit's delayed five.  And I got to record.  So now I'm fucked.  So now I start thinking, like, I got my equipment with me if I need it.  I'm like, I'll record in Detroit.  Iggy's from Detroit.  I'll just go out into the streets and do it there.  Like, that's how I'm thinking.  I don't give a shit.  All I give a shit about is the podcast.  And then finally I just, I bought a JetBlue ticket to New York.  And then they're like, that's delayed till seven.  I'm like, is it going to get out of here?  And they're like, we don't fucking. 
[01:36:30]  What the fuck is going on?  And the weather was clear.  And that's when I started hating Buffalo.  I'm like, can't you get your shit together?  Like, American Airlines doesn't give enough of a shit to fly a plane from Chicago an hour  so I can get another plane out of that airport?  Oh, boy.  So I bought one at Delta.  And this goes nowhere.  But anyway, so I flew down here and I recorded it in the fucking hotel room.  But this is not the news.  Oh, so you never got back to LA?  No, I didn't.  And now I got to deal with, you know, I got to call the girl.  Like, I'm not going to be back for another three days.  She's like, it's all right.  You're doing what you got to do. 
[01:37:00]  And then the next morning it's like, I only miss you.  Here's the news.  I asked her to marry me.  Whoa!  Congratulations.  Yeah, it's weird when it's your third time.  When people say congratulations, you're like, yeah, we'll see what happens.  You know, you've been with her for a while.  Yeah, I've been with her for like three years.  There was a lot of pressure.  There's been a lot of pressure.  A lot of holding up the finger with the no ring.  Oh, wow.  The waving of the finger.  And, you know, finally I did it.  I, you know, I took her out.  I said, okay, we'll go look at rings. 
[01:37:30]  I don't want to buy you the wrong fucking ring.  I can't live with that.  You know, because I know this girl.  If I bought her the wrong ring, it would have been just a nightmare.  She was not going to be happy with any ring.  Right.  So I take her to this jewelry store and we're looking at, she shows me one that she likes.  I'm like, all right, I get the idea.  And I wasn't even sure when I was going to do it or if I was going to do it.  But the next day I went and bought that fucking ring.  And I thought, like, whether it happens or not, I'll take the hit if I have to sell this back.  But I'm not going to give her a fucking ring that she doesn't want.  So she's got me by the balls pretty hard.  I can't believe you're doing this.  I know.  Is this your third marriage?  I know. 
[01:38:00]  How many times?  Yeah, it's third.  Help me out.  Wait, now let's talk about it.  Wait, what's that?  I'm trying to go back in time.  I think after two he said, oh, we got tapes of you.  He has horrendous marriage stories.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  What's different?  What's different?  What is happening in your head?  I'm terrified of this one.  Yeah.  I think you are.  I think that's what's different.  I'm terrified and I'm concerned. 
[01:38:30]  Man.  Yeah.  I don't think I know the difference between, you know, the warmth of rage when it surrounds  my heart and the warmth of love when it surrounds my heart.  It's the same thing.  I know that when the warmth of rage surrounds my heart, I'm thinking like, fuck you.  But when the warmth of love surrounds my heart, I'm afraid of that.  So there's some mixture I have to find in the middle.  But here's what happens.  So I buy this ring and I decide I'm going to give it to her on her birthday, which is three  weeks away.  She knew it was coming though.  Not really.  I mean, it was a surprise to her.  I don't think she really believed that I was going to do it. 
[01:39:00]  And I'm not, you know, I don't know that I did either, but I knew I was going to give  it on her birthday.  But it was hilarious because I bought that ring.  I put it in the drawer and that ring just turned on this scrutiny.  Like I knew it was out there and I knew I had it and I was planning on doing it.  So every minute of every fucking day, I was like, all right, this is it.  This is what I'm going to do.  I'm watching her eyes.  I'm watching her mouth.  I'm watching what she says.  I'm watching how she walks.  I'm like, I don't know that.  That's a weird thing that walk, you know, like it's like, it just turned on this thing  in my head where it's like, are you fucking sure you're going to do this?  You're never going to be sure. 
[01:39:30]  Everything's under a microscope.  And then her birthday comes and I didn't know how I was going to do it.  I thought like, why not just put it?  Because it's her first time.  She wants to be excited.  I'm a jaded fuck.  You know, I want to try to make it good for her.  So I didn't know how to give it to her.  I knew I had to do something special because she was talking about like, are you going  to put it in a champagne glass?  I don't know why.  All of a sudden I'm doing Dice's girls.  No, but she said, you're going to put it in a champagne glass at dinner.  And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do.  I'm not going to do that because obviously you read that somewhere.  So my thought was, why not just put it in the bed so she rolls over on it and goes, 
[01:40:00]  what's that?  And then my friend Jonah said, well, then she might think you fucked someone else in your  bed.  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  Yeah.  So I decided, all right, I'm going to make her pancakes and work from there.  And I said, I'm going to make you pancakes for your birthday.  And I didn't even know if I had the shit for pancakes.  It turns out I had the shit for pancakes.  So I make pancakes and I figure out I'm going to put the ring right in top of the center pancake  like that.  And, but the problem was she was in bed. 
[01:40:30]  I had put the ring in the bedroom to follow through with the rolling over on it plan.  So, uh, so now she's in bed.  I make these fucking pancakes and I'm like, why don't you come out and eat your pancakes?  She's like, I thought I was getting breakfast in bed.  No, formal breakfast today.  Cause I had to get the ring out of there.  Yeah.  So I forced her out, you know, I'm like, just come on, eat at the table like a person.  So she comes out and I run back into the room to grab the ring.  I put it in my, in the pocket of my robe and I come back out and she goes, why'd you  run back to the room?  And I don't know why I was caught off guard, but I swear to God, I said I had to get something 
[01:41:00]  for my cock.  That's what I said.  I don't even know why I said that, but on some level it's kind of true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then I go into the kitchen, I stick that fucking ring right in the middle of the pancake  and I serve her the pancake.  She starts crying.  She's like, oh my God.  And I take it out of the pancake.  I stick it on her finger.  I go, will you marry me?  She goes, ow, ow, hot.  It's hot.  So I got to take the ring off cause I burn her fucking finger with the ring.  I don't know if that's a sign. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That's a, so I had to re-propose.  I'm like, all right, let's do it again.  Will you marry me?  She's like, of course I will.  Wow.  I'm like, what'd I do in my head?  Is there a date or anything?  No, but like, it's like, I thought, you know, I always think it's going to buy me a little  time.  You know, she's fast track.  Amazing.  Now she's like, when do you want to talk about the thing?  But she doesn't want to have a big thing, which is nice, but I know she wants to have  a baby.  And I'm telling you, man, there's a feeling in my heart here.  There's a wall.  There's a wall that I got to get through here.  All right. 
[01:42:00]  Like I know, like I'm very easily angered right now.  You know, I just, she, I should be excited.  I'm getting married, but there I'm just fucking terrified.  And some people are like, why are you doing it again?  She's like 19, 20 years younger than me.  And I'm like, in my mind, it's like, what am I, what else am I going to do?  Just cycle through a bunch of like, you know, middle-aged women.  I guess with the occasional younger one that, that thinks, you know, I'm going to teach her  something or resolve some issue she has, you know, I'm just going to do that for the  rest of my life till my charm wears off and my game is gone. 
[01:42:30]  And I'm 65, jerking off by myself, napping.  Is that what I want?  With no one to leave my money to?  That sounds great.  That actually sounds perfect.  You're not going to have to turn Anthony.  Oh my God.  But I, so, but the thing is, is like, I think it's all going to happen and I have not had  a child and I'm terrified of it.  And you had one recently?  I got two.  Yeah.  My youngest is eight months old.  And you're my age, right?  More or less.  All right.  All right.  You might have a couple.  I got a three-year-old too. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  So like, and I just hope she, cause there's some part of me like with her where I'm like,  I'm still having issues with the girl, with the fiance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm still saying to her, are you going to clean up your room?  I mean, I say that to her.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So now my concern is I'm going to have a baby.  I'm like, what do I got to clean up after both of you?  Yeah, you do.  You do, right?  Yeah.  But they, they snap out of it, right?  They become mothers and they lock in.  Am I right?  Tell me I'm right.  Lock in.  Yeah.  They become motherly.  Sure.  Boy, but they do the thing, right? 
[01:43:30]  I'm not going to, what thing?  I don't know.  Which thing?  The thing with the baby.  They'll take care of the baby.  They will?  Yeah.  Very motherly.  You're going to have to get in there every once in a while and change the diaper or something.  No, no, I know I'm going to have to do almost everything, but, you know, they'll,  you know, like if the kid doesn't like me, she'll, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll gravitate toward the mom.  Fucking hell, man.  You know, Bobby Kelly just had a baby too.  He's my age too, right?  Isn't he?  A little younger probably?  No, he's probably a few.  He probably is like 42.  Did you always want to be a father?  No, I never thought about it.  You just never thought about it? 
[01:44:00]  No thoughts all these years?  I love this.  I always wanted to, but I was always with the wrong fucking people.  I'm a selfish fucking person, and I think I just learned how to care about some people  in general.  I think that, you know, between the podcast and the humbling from the second wife and  everything, it forced me to open my heart a bit.  Like, I really care about this girl.  I never really felt that before.  Like, it's almost like, like, I care about her in an unusual way.  You know, like, I'm concerned about, you know, I'm running around like, I have a hard  time with this.  Oh, wow.  You're, you're in. 
[01:44:30]  You're in deep.  You're running around what?  Yeah, just, you know, like, are you okay, baby?  Do you want me to go get you some food?  It's called love.  He's in love.  Yeah, but I mean, it's not like she's a, like a, she's not handicapped, and I'm treating  her like, I'm like, you don't want to leave the house?  Oh, you want to do things for her?  Oh, wow.  You're in love, man.  It's one of those things that seems codependent, but it's actually love.  Right.  I don't know, Jim.  You're in a deep level of love.  I say, fuck it.  Just go with it.  Just fucking.  You got to get out now.  Don't do it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:45:00]  Just fucking have a kid and just go with it.  We already had the horrible fight, you know, like, like, like, days after, uh, the engagement.  Yeah, it was horrendous.  Oh, really?  It was horrendous.  Usually that puts you in a nice fucking, you know, spot for a while.  Well, it was a good spot for a couple of days, but I took her.  A couple of days?  Oh, man.  What happened?  I took her with me on a thing.  You know, I was doing these book events, you know, and I wanted her to go because I thought  it'd be nice.  She hasn't really been to Washington, D.C., right?  So, you know, it was, uh, it was, uh, it was D.C. and then New York and then Boston. 
[01:45:30]  So we get to D.C.  And I don't know what it is about traveling, but we fucking ridiculous fights when we travel.  But here we are in D.C.  And I just want to show her around because, I mean, I've grown to really appreciate D.C.  Whatever the hell goes on, there's one thing.  But the fucking museums and the monuments.  Oh, awesome.  You've got to go check it out, right?  Absolutely.  So I'm like, I'm going to show you.  And I'm impressed.  This is not like an age thing.  I mean, she's 20 years younger than me, but it's not like, yeah, Washington's for old  people.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the fucking capital of the country. 
[01:46:00]  So we're walking around and, you know, and she had mentioned that she saw some Smithsonian  stuff in the museum movies, the night of the museum movies.  She said, yeah, that one of them had the plane from Kitty Hawk.  I'm like, oh, we'll go to Aaron's Mace.  You know, I've never been there.  It's great.  So we go there and I'm walking around.  I never knew what a fucking guy I am.  But, you know, I'm not even a plane guy, but you go there like, look at that jet.  It's a rocket.  Rocket.  It's all kinds of great stuff.  My dick feels huge here.  So we walk around there and then we leave and then I'm like, we got to go to the museum 
[01:46:30]  of the American Indian because they have the best food.  There's a food court at the museum of the American Indian where they have like indigenous  foods from all the tribes and it's like all very interesting and it's real good food.  And she's like, I'm probably not going to want to eat there.  And I'm like, because she's like, I'm not hungry.  But then she's vegetarian, but they're going to have stuff for you.  And she's like, I'm probably not, but we can go.  So in my mind, I think, well, she's probably going to want to get something to eat.  Right.  So this is as simple as it goes.  Oh, no.  So we go to this place and I'm like looking around because I love looking at food, you  know, like I can go just walk around and look at fucking food and it's great. 
[01:47:00]  So we walk in.  I'm like, oh, my God, look at all this weird shit.  There's squash and there's like maize.  Yeah, maize.  So you can eat maize.  It's vegetarian.  That's a maize.  Maize.  And then she's like, you know, I'm like, I'm probably going to get something.  You want to get something?  I got a lot of vegetarian stuff.  She says, I told you I wasn't going to want to eat here.  Oh.  And I was like, fuck it.  I don't want to eat here either.  And then the next thing I know, we're in front of the Museum of the American Indian  and she's snoring off.  She's like, I told you I didn't want to eat there.  I'm like, don't fucking run away. 
[01:47:30]  Like loud.  Like people are starting to look.  She's like, I'm not doing this.  I'm not talking to you like this.  I'm like, like what?  Like what?  You can't.  I just wanted you to see Washington and you're not going to.  You're going to fucking do this.  You're going to storm away.  And like she's like running away because I'm the yelling guy now.  And I'm trying to do it like, you know, like, God, don't you fucking.  But you're making a scene.  A little bit.  There wasn't a lot of people there, but she's making it too.  It's not all on me.  Right, right.  I'm not going to take that.  But I did not have to say, you know, I'm fucking done with this.  Give me the fucking ring. 
[01:48:00]  No.  I did.  You said that.  After like two days or.  Maybe a week.  A week.  Because when this happened, they both thought, is this what it's going to be forever?  Right.  This fucking asshole dragging me around in a shitty Indian place.  Right.  And you're going, I can't even fucking take her to some culture.  Right.  Right.  It was horrible.  I did a horrible thing.  Yeah.  I did a horrible thing.  She's like, oh, fuck you.  And she gives it to me.  And then she storms off.  And I storm off.  And now we're walking on opposite side.  She called you Indian giver?  That would have been like ironic.  Right out in front of the place.  I wish I'd thought of that. 
[01:48:30]  That would have been a good one.  Maybe break the tension.  So now we're walking on opposite sides of the mall in Washington.  She's, you know, crying over on her side.  I'm walking on mine.  Knowing I did this shitty thing.  And that now I just made it unstable.  And I did the worst thing I could possibly do.  And I'm like, but, you know, fuck it.  She didn't want to eat there.  You know.  So I'm just storming down the mall.  And I'm sort of pacing her.  I'm watching her walk away.  On the other side.  And then she texts me. 
[01:49:00]  She's like, I love you.  What are we doing?  And then I'm like, I love you too.  I'll meet you in front of the Capitol.  So we met in front of the Capitol.  I put the ring back on her finger and asked her to marry me again.  I did that three times.  Three?  In a week.  With the same ring.  In a week.  So what did you wind up eating?  Holy shit.  Is that great?  What did you wind up eating?  Oh, fuck.  What did we do?  We went to.  She wanted to go see the dinosaur bones.  And, you know, then we.  She wanted Chipotle.  What's that?  Chipotle.  Ah, yes. 
[01:49:30]  Daddy, when was the last time you looked at dinosaurs?  It's not nothing.  I love dinosaurs.  Like a month ago.  Really?  In New York.  Yeah.  Kids.  Yeah.  But it's amazing.  One in my yard.  Yes.  Do you?  Wow.  I got one of those, like, five and a half foot velociraptors.  Oh, you do really?  And I put it by my jacuzzi.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you really love dinosaurs?  I love dinosaurs.  No, he loves children.  Children love dinosaurs.  Gotta get the kids into the jacuzzi. 
[01:50:00]  It's terrible.  Dinosaur bones rule.  There you go.  There's his dinosaur.  Oh, that's great.  My little dinosaur.  I just keep, when you look at him, you're like, holy fuck.  And this was millions and millions of years ago.  It's hard.  It's a weird moment of, like, you're very impressed, but you're also like, oh, we're doomed.  Oh, it's sad.  Yeah, yeah.  If these fucking things die for whatever reason.  Of course.  Just imagine that they were actually there at some point.  They actually lived and walked around.  It's like, that's a monster.  That's a real-life monster.  Yeah.  And it was walking the earth. 
[01:50:30]  I just hate they put the dates on.  I'm like, oh, really?  This is like 80 billion years ago.  But also, when you see the ones that were in the ocean, that's why I don't go in the ocean.  Oh, man.  Because in my mind, a couple of them have to be out there.  They're still there.  They've got to be out there.  And they're, like, as big as this building, like, fucking giant teeth.  That scares the shit out of me.  Monsters under the water.  We don't know.  I can't even go into a pool at night.  We don't know.  At night.  I can't see the bottom.  It's fucking creepy down there.  I don't know what got in the pool.  You don't know what's in there when you go in the ocean.  It's like, you look down.  It's horrendous.  It's got this weird, you can see a little bit down here, but I'm not going to show you 
[01:51:00]  much.  The ocean does not tip its hand.  You're fucking in there.  It's all based on faith.  And the light is, what, only 200 feet, I think?  Like, after that, it's just complete fucking darkness.  Oh, it's horrible.  It's a horrible feeling.  Those people that can just jump off boats and swim around, I can't talk about it.  We took a lot of boats across Lake Erie.  Even in a lake, right?  We would stop in the middle, and, you know, the tunes are cranking, and we'd go for a swim,  and we would take our showers because it's fresh water.  And when you dive off that boat, you're like, what the fuck is staring right back at me? 
[01:51:30]  I was petrified.  I'm not even going to make believe.  And then I would swim around the boat, keep the boat nice and close.  I'm a real fucking wimp.  If you looked at where you were and how big you were, if you drained all the water and  just put you in midair where the water would be, you're like hovering over mountain ranges.  Sure.  And all kinds of goodies are down there.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  Big monsters.  You're a speck.  But if you close your eyes, it's all good. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I mean, you keep your eyes closed when you jump in.  Right.  The odds are with you probably in a lake.  Because I don't want to open that eye and see some blurry shit coming at me.  But in a lake, what's the worst it could be?  A giant catfish?  A giant catfish?  I don't know.  I think there's no sharks in the lake.  No.  There's no dragons.  They got some shit.  What's that show on TV?  The River Monsters Van?  Yeah.  River Monsters is a great show.  There's River Monsters.  With the zombie kids eating your teeth.  Oh, God.  What is that?  It's windshield wipers hitting the toes.  Nibbling on you. 
[01:52:30]  You see the alligator turtle thing?  No.  It looks like it's fucking a dinosaur.  Yeah.  I don't know the name of it anymore, but.  Oh.  They're out there.  What about the guys?  We talk about it from time to time on our show.  The guys that go noodling.  Would you do that?  I don't know what noodling is.  You've never heard of noodling?  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was a guitar term.  They fucking noodle around.  They go in these swamps and these riverbeds.  Yeah.  And they go for the catfish.  Is it catfish they're going for?  Catfish, yeah.  It's all kinds of.  And they put their arm in these fucking holes and the catfish bites them all the way. 
[01:53:00]  They pull it out halfway up their forearm.  That's how they catch these things.  Can you imagine fucking doing that?  I don't like when my foot hits something at the beach that feels a little like it's not  a rock or a shell or something.  You're like, I don't know what that is.  I can't get away from it fast enough.  And you don't know if it's just part of the larger thing?  Right.  Like, you're just like, oh, that's just the eyelid of something that's inside of a car.  Yeah.  You don't want to.  Oh, it's fucking creepy.  Something brushes against your leg, which was probably like seaweed or something.  But to me, it's a giant monster. 
[01:53:30]  I just wear crunchy shoes now.  Just crunch everything.  I don't give a fuck.  I think it's a good idea to wear those.  I like those scuba booties that zip up on the side.  Why the fuck would you go out there barefoot enough?  It makes you feel safer.  Even though it's the same danger.  I don't want to step on.  I used to be petrified.  I didn't even know where they are, where they're fucking indigenous to.  I was stepping on a rockfish because I heard like rockfish has those spines and they  put poison in you and you're pretty much dead.  I'd be at the beach just going, oh, I'm going to step on a rockfish. 
[01:54:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I always thought I was stepping on a rockfish as a kid.  Or even fucking jellyfish, man.  They hurt.  Yes.  I never got bit by one of those.  Never?  Those are terrible.  Oh, they fucking suck when it gets stung.  Or barracudas or mora eels.  Whatever.  All of it.  All of it.  We had horseshoe crabs, too.  They're not going to hurt you, though.  I know, but as a kid, it's that big spiny thing and your friends tell you they fucking  stab you with it.  It's terrifying looking.  It is.  But they're very slow.  Oh, yeah.  But maybe in the water.  In the water, you're very slow.  Try, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  And that's just another thing.  Like, you could be king shit on dry land.  Yeah.  You're fucking top of the food chain and everything.  You drop quite a few levels as far as the food chain goes once you're in that water.  You're a bullion cube.  Yes.  You should go diving.  And you'll realize that, you know, first of all, it's almost impossible to see a fucking  fish.  I don't even know where the fuck they all are.  I snorkel.  And if you do see a fish, you realize they fucking run away from run away.  They swim away from you immediately.  They're scared shitless of us.  But I went snorkeling in Kauai, and I like doing it. 
[01:55:00]  But, you know, when you get the snorkel going, you get out on the reef, and then you see that  drop off at the edge of the reef.  Cool, right?  And then, yeah, it's cool, but still, like, I can't stop from seeing something coming out  of that dark.  You look out there, and you're like, that's just a mouse.  It's never ending.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And something could just come right at me.  Right at me.  And what am I going to do?  And it's always huge.  Yes.  Right.  Giant.  Like, it's something that you've never seen before.  Like, you've imagined it.  You'd be looking, going, what is this?  Is that something moving?  And then before you know it, it's like, oh my god, it's a giant monster coming for me.  A monster. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Like, the whole island just lifts up.  You think it's a tiny fish, and then it's the big reveal where it's as big as a fucking...  Giant.  Yeah, the tiny fish is just on some sort of...  And he's just lying.  Doing that thing, coming at you, back and forth, swimming, and you're like, I can't fucking  out on this.  Yeah, it's just bubbles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just...  Moo!  It's a fucking petrified, screaming underwater.  It's just a cloud of blood. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Cloud of blood.  Watching your own blood rise up around you.  Moo!  Moo!  Moo!  Moo!  Moo!  Moo!  Moo!  That's terrible.  Half of you starts bobbing.  Oh, it's just horrible.  You're girl's like waving.  What do you die from first?  It's like the loss of blood for being bitten in half, or do you drown, or what the...  It just seems like something I don't want.  Either way, it's only a few seconds for you to think about it.  I would gather, right?  You can't breathe, and I'm half gone.  Mark, you've been busy.  Holy shit. 
[01:56:30]  I'm doing...  I'm here because I'm doing panel on Letterman for the first time ever on Wednesday.  Oh, nice.  Congratulations on that.  Yeah, it's been a lot of things where you spend your...  Like, I've done stand-up on there a few times over the 25 years, but not a lot.  Are you nervous doing panel?  Well, I know how to do it, but it's Dave, and he's like my guy.  I've been watching him since day one when I was in college, and as a comic, you're sort  of like...  When he moved, and we took a few panel guys with him as far as stand-ups, I thought in  my mind, well, that's over. 
[01:57:00]  I'm never going to do panel with him.  And now it's happening, and I feel like, all right, so I can quit?  Like, there's part of me that feels like that was some great goal achieved.  I mean, hopefully I don't get bumped or something, but yeah, I'm nervous because I want to...  You know, I mean, he's the best, so I don't think I'm going to flounder.  You won't get bumped for a panel.  I don't think so.  But, you know, I'm just trying to figure out what things to do, because I want to do well,  and I want...  Because I get a little...  I don't get nervous, but I know I'm going to be sitting there.  Like, I did Jay Leno for the first time ever, and I don't really watch Jay, but when I 
[01:57:30]  was pushing the book and pushing the show, I'm like, yeah, well, why not do it?  It was kind of interesting, because he came into the dressing room before I went on for  like a half hour.  Yeah, we had that.  We couldn't believe it.  Me and Ann talked about it after the fact, going, don't you have a show to prepare for?  He's hanging out, having a good old time.  I'm like, holy fuck, when does he get ready?  Yeah, he's standing there in his denim shirt.  We had all the same experience.  He was talking cars, and he was talking about, you know, shock jocks, and radio, and just 
[01:58:00]  whatever.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I loved that.  I loved that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he came backstage, he's like, yeah, I didn't think you'd do this.  I didn't think you'd do my show.  I thought you didn't like it.  Oh, yeah, the Tonight Show.  Yeah, sure.  I was thinking, well, he thought I was in Conan camp, or what, you know, like he thought  I was part of...  You know, on some level, I never sought to do it, because I just didn't watch it, and it  was not...  You know, and whatever.  I didn't.  I was not doing it on principle.  Right.  That was the truth.  But then, like, you know, when all of a sudden you have an opportunity, like, I'm pushing  the book, and I got the show, and I'm going to do panel, and I don't have to do stand-up. 
[01:58:30]  I'm like, why not?  It's still the Tonight Show.  And I have that moment, you know, the feeling, don't matter who the host is, where, you know,  you see people on TV, and then when you're sitting there, right next to them, and the  cameras are on, it's like, you think you're just talking to somebody, but you're not.  It's crazy.  Yeah, everything is heightened, and, you know, it's happening in the moment, and you're like,  oh my god, he's right there, and with Dave, I have to hide that shit, because you can't  sit there and go, oh my god, you're right there, you know? 
[01:59:00]  That would be a great way to open it.  Oh my god, you're right here.  You're right there.  That would be funny.  I see this on television.  Yeah, I saw you on the thing.  This is crazy.  Yeah, but I do have that feeling.  The weirdest thing, you're right, because you're sitting there looking at the face, and  words are coming out of your mouth, you're talking, but you're thinking, like, holy shit,  am I doing this?  Exactly.  Like, this is what I've watched.  Are people watching this, and seeing me like I saw other people sitting there, and then 
[01:59:30]  it's just like, this is the most oddest fucking thing ever.  I get so nervous that I relax.  It's almost like, it's like, I'm so doomed to fail, I feel like somebody who's about to  be executed, and has resigned himself to the fact that my brains are going to be splattered,  and that helps sometimes.  Wow.  Yeah, when you get so anxious or nervous about something, and you just go into a weird paralysis,  like you just hit this peak, and you're like, ugh.  Like, you're locked in.  You're accepting your fate.  But it happens with Conan, too, where I'm sitting there looking at him, because I don't 
[02:00:00]  know what you expect them to do, you know, because they're doing that every night.  That's their job.  You guys do this every day.  Right.  So, but, you know, you're like, you know, I've never talked to this guy before, so you're  there with all this juice, and he's like, are we talking?  It's like, and then you realize, he fucking does this every night.  Right.  This is his audience.  There's a camera there.  He sees it all the time.  It's not Mark Maron night.  It's not the Mark Maron show for a night.  I'm just a guy passing through.  Yeah, yeah.  It's hard for them to get juiced when I'm sitting there, too. 
[02:00:30]  It's like, Tom Cruise is here tomorrow in this seat.  What do I expect out of this guy?  I'm lucky he's not spitting on me.  Like, the most important moment right then and there.  It's so important to you.  And then then it's like, Tuesday.  Exactly.  Who are you on with, you know?  I don't.  Can we look it up?  Yeah, I always like to check.  I don't know.  Wednesday.  But, you know, it was a pretty good experience.  But that's true, man.  Because, like, you get done, and you're like, huh?  Huh?  And then it's just people cleaning up.  You know, and it's like, another day.  No, it was my day.  It was my day. 
[02:01:00]  It was very big for me.  Can you step aside?  We've got to put the bands got to go in.  Because they're looking at your segment the same way, with the same way they looked at  the monologue.  Yeah, don't matter.  And segment two.  Like, okay, Marin's segment was good, but segment three, it's just one of five segments  for Tuesday.  Exactly.  To you, it's your life.  You've got Jamie Foxx.  Oh, okay.  Backstreet Boys.  Backstreet Boys top ten?  Yeah, they'll be there for the top ten.  All right.  Then you've got the Marc Maron.  I'm on after Jamie.  And then what's the last thing?  Wale.  Huh?  Wale. 
[02:01:30]  Who's that?  He's a performer.  He's like a rapper.  Oh, it's okay.  All right, I'm going to pull into a new audience.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cuts out of your demo a little bit.  Do you know Jamie?  I'm sure he knows you.  The only experience I have with Jamie is, you know, I saw him in the, like, the Ambassador  Lounge at an airport, and I think in Austin, and he looked hungover and tired, and I made  the choice not to bother him.  But I stared at him for a while.  Good one.  Yeah.  No, so I don't know him at all.  Yeah, I've never met him either.  He used to be a funny guy.  Yeah.  You know, but he's a very talented man, that guy. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, comics don't usually, like, I had to do, I was doing Leno panels at my second,  I had only done it a couple of times, panel, and I was supposed to be Jenna Fisher, but  she canceled.  Yeah.  And they called day of, and they say, look, it's going to be Bill Maher.  And I'm like, fuck, another comic, because you were, at the time it was McCain, it was  during the election, 2008.  So he was loaded up for bear, that guy.  But I'm like, fuck, man.  And they knew the topics I was going to discuss, and they're like, well, you know, he's going  to hit on McCain, and he's going to hit on Obama.  Right.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  I have to restructure this.  Right.  But he was so good, man. 
[02:02:30]  Like, sitting next to him, you don't know what a guy's going to be like.  Mark, he's a pro.  But he was really supportive.  Like, he wasn't a dick trying to outdo it.  He was having fun with it.  Like, comics are usually good to each other, as long as there's no fucking prior hatred  there.  Right.  So I'm sure Jamie will be fine.  No, but he's an actor now.  I mean, and he's also very funny, but I mean, he seems to be at some other level.  Yeah.  You know, I wonder when the last time he did comedy really was.  It's been a while.  I think it's probably been a while.  A long time.  Yeah.  I'm just happy if I'm on the show with somebody who I know who they are, one, and that I 
[02:03:00]  have some respect for.  Yeah.  It's great.  You know?  Well, I got to go back to the lake thing for you, because you said nothing could hurt you in  the lake.  Okay.  Okay.  I forgot for a second.  My brother's a marine biologist, and he just wrote.  He forgot that?  I did forget that for a second.  He just texted me.  He said, I think it's pronounced muskel lunge will take your arm off in a lake.  A muskel lunge?  Is this a picture?  I want to Google image muskel lunge.  Get that up there.  M-U-S-K-E-L. 
[02:03:30]  That should be the muskel part.  And then lunge.  L-U-N-G-E.  It's nice.  Is that a replay?  I don't know.  Is he in New York?  I think it's a replay.  I think they're on vacation.  Yeah, I think they're on vacation.  All right.  Google image.  This thing will take your arm off in a lake.  There you go.  He fucking dicing his sunglasses and knickers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  Right.  With the serious face.  He looks good.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, God.  There you go.  That's a monster.  Looks like a barracuda. 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  Look at them teeth.  A big thank you to my brother.  Like a barracuda sturgeon.  Holy.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't need to know that's in a lake.  It's a troutacuda.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't need to know this.  Yeah.  I kind of felt like lakes were kind of a safe hand.  And he said that could take your arm off?  No problem, he said.  No problem.  No problem.  Look at the teeth on the fucking thing.  Yeah, I have some big teeth.  Let me see that thing, though.  Look at that guy.  He looks like this just ate my child.  He does look disturbed.  He looks very scared.  Yeah, he's going to dump the Kintner boy out all over the dock.  That'll take your arm off. 
[02:04:30]  Muscle lunge.  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.  Just a license plate.  How do you spell it?  M-U-S-K-E-L-L-U-N-G-E.  Did that from my brain, by the way?  Muscle lunge.  Oh, I got a text from my fiancÃ©e.  Aww.  Just woke up on the couch.  Miss you so much.  Aww.  She always falls asleep on the couch.  She doesn't like to go in the bed without me.  Aww.  Wow, you got it.  You got it bad.  Have you had it this bad?  I did years ago.  That's gone now. 
[02:05:00]  That's all over.  I did years ago.  I feel more affection for the actual couch than I do for people I've dated recently.  The sad thing is, I never knew this part of me.  I've got to be honest with you.  Wow, this is new.  But I'm not sure it's a good thing.  The last two wives I destroyed and drained.  Right.  I really didn't know the difference between what I wanted and what they wanted.  For me, I was just a selfish, angry fuck.  Sure.  And I think there's something that I'm trying to make up for here by overcompensating to 
[02:05:30]  the point where I might as well be wearing a fucking apron all the time.  Now, have you worked through all that?  Like, you were married, obviously, and there were problems because of, well, it can't just  be one-sided, I'm sure, her, but also yourself.  You seem to have been dealing with a lot of issues and anger and stuff.  Have you changed?  Are you a different person as far as those?  Look, yeah, because the thing is, you would think not because of the Washington thing.  Uh-huh. 
[02:06:00]  But that doesn't happen much because of the Washington thing.  Like the day in Washington.  Yes.  The Washington incident.  But no, we're going to counseling.  Like, I've learned that for me, like, I think like day three or four should be couples counseling.  Wow.  Yeah, right in.  But no, we started going because, you know, I couldn't wrap my brain around having a baby.  So we started to go for that.  Here's the weirdest thing, though, man.  And so my buddy, who's a therapist, he recommends a therapist for us to go to couples counseling  to work through stuff, right? 
[02:06:30]  So I go to this guy, and we both go, and it's a good start.  And he says, you know, my wife is also a therapist, and, you know, we can see you together.  Like, you know, if you want, he said that Jessica, my fiancee, could see his wife, and I could  see him, and then we could all meet together.  That's weird.  But it makes sense.  But it is fucking weird.  You're sort of like, you know, when we all meet together, it's sort of like a dinner  party where there's no food, and I'm losing money.  You're paying the tab. 
[02:07:00]  But there's this weird, but it's...  But what's going to be a secret, though?  Like, what if you say something to him in confidence, and then all of a sudden it comes  out with the four of you, like...  Well, you sign a weird thing.  Like, there's definitely a team thing, because every time we go, you know, especially if we  meet with both of them, you know, she's already made him the enemy.  But I think that's kind of the genius of it.  Like, you know, it's like, he doesn't get me at all.  And I'm like, oh, really?  I don't know.  I think he's...  I told him some stuff.  So, but I don't know what they talk about, you know, together.  Like, I'd like to think we leave, and they sit there and go, all right, here's the angle.  Right, right. 
[02:07:30]  But I don't fucking know.  But I'm not...  Look, I'm not...  You know, yeah, there's some things I have to assume that there's...  What do you have to sign that's weird?  Well, you've got to say that they can talk about you guys.  Oh, okay.  Like, you know, that it's a collective thing.  Like, they're going to discuss...  Oh, it's just not breaking doctor-patient confidence out.  Right, with the two of them, you know.  Oh, so you guys leave.  Forget about it.  They're probably like, they are doomed.  They are fucking doomed.  Yeah.  That's what I think.  There's a huge problem.  Oh, you think he's bad?  Wait till you find out what the fuck she's...  Oh, yeah.  They do this.  They're probably talking about it while they're fucking. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the only way they can get off.  It's like discussing other couples' misery.  There was one point where, like, you know, like, they were...  She was talking, and I was starting to steam, man.  Oh, shit.  And, like, you know, you've got to let them talk.  And I'm like, oh, that's fucking ridiculous.  That's bullshit.  And then, like, literally, you know, I don't remember who was guiding the question,  but the wife and the therapist couple, she goes, this isn't going well.  And I'm like, you mean you don't have a plan?  Someone's got to have a plan, because I'm about to fucking leave.  Holy shit. 
[02:08:30]  So, you know, I didn't leave.  Yeah.  But, like, okay, so...  But the anger thing is better.  You know, we are...  We're not...  We're not doing that.  You're not in that angry place.  Things are better.  The thing, I don't...  The XY thing is done.  You know, I wrote the book.  There's stuff in there.  You know, that book, like, for me, was a purging.  Like, my father's not talking to me.  Oh, wow.  Why?  Yeah, I think I threw him under the bus a little.  What did you say about him that he injected to?  Everything.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Well, yeah, because, like, well, you know, like, I was doing shows and stuff.  Like, my father has never paid attention. 
[02:09:00]  I don't even think he fucking listened to the podcast, and he's been on three of them.  Oh, shit.  Like, I didn't tell him he was on, but who cares?  Right.  So, but the thing was is that when he started to get wind that the IFC show had a character  in there based on him that I...  Who was a bipolar kind of guy.  But it was Judd Hirsch.  I mean, arguably a better father.  So, you know, but he got wind of it, like, and then I started getting these emails.  Like, I told him, I said, you know, there's a couple episodes with the dad character, but  I went easy, and, you know, I'm not... 
[02:09:30]  You know, he was concerned that I would reveal certain things, and I wouldn't do it.  But, you know, I don't think, you know, the bipolar thing is, you know, it's not a big  secret.  I mean, like, my friend Mark Spitt says, it's like, it's like diabetes.  Everyone's fucking bipolar.  Right.  Plus, it's also a fictional slash real character.  Right.  Right.  There was a lot of fiction to it.  But, yeah.  But so he got wind of that, and he started getting nervous.  Right.  So about a week before the show goes on, I get this call.  He's like, so what'd you do?  Wait, I mean, you know, what'd you say on the show?  I was like, it's going to be fine.  He goes, what channel is it on?  And I go, it's on IFC.  He goes, no one gets that, right?  I don't get that.  But not even thinking it was an insult. 
[02:10:00]  He was like, oh, I'll be all right, because no one will see it.  So then, like, the commercials start running.  I get an email.  He's like, you know, a lawyer friend saw the commercial, and, you know, I'm not going to go that route.  But I'm just saying that, you know, maybe we, like, he wanted to negotiate something.  Right.  Your dad?  Yeah.  No, he wanted to, he said, I might sue you, right, basically.  But then it got all crazy.  He was just freaking out, because he's like, he's crazy.  He's a megalomaniacal guy.  So he thought, you know, it was all about him.  And then all of a sudden, he started paying more attention to me in that week than he ever had in my entire life. 
[02:10:30]  He had a Google search on me.  He was, like, sending me emails going, you know, I just read the thing from 1997.  Very interesting.  Like, he felt like, you know, like, I got to see how he's going to take me on.  So he watched and did everything.  Is he self-centered?  Yeah, he's self-centered.  He's bipolar.  And, you know, he's completely narcissistic.  And I think, like, he just saw me as a limb.  You know, like a limb that got away.  Like, that's my other hand.  Wait, can I stop for a second?  What kind of relationship did you guys have? 
[02:11:00]  What kind of father was he?  Just give us the basics here.  When you were growing up.  He was a guy that was very self-involved.  He was a doctor.  So, you know, he was always out, you know.  But, you know, when he was around, everything sort of revolved around whatever thing he was doing.  Whether it was rage or whether it was, you know, hey, let's go skiing.  It's very weird when you have a manic-depressive father.  Because, you know, when they plan it, they're excited.  But the vacation might be sad.  Wow.  We're going to Yosemite.  And then, like, weeks later, you're in Yosemite.  He's like, I don't want to lose. 
[02:11:30]  Sounded like a good idea.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to.  But, uh, I think that would be a horrible vacation.  I knew there was a reason why I liked you.  But you got that, too?  I got a mom.  Oh, with the bipolar?  Very similar shit.  Yeah, it's weird.  She's got OCD and other things going on.  I don't know.  But it's always about her.  Right.  Right.  Always, always.  Now I wrote this book, and, like, I'm reading it.  See, I want to write a book, but I'm waiting for the day.  That she dies?  Yeah.  You should just write it.  And then she dies.  You have a final chapter.  Well, no, I think that maybe you can kill her while she's alive. 
[02:12:00]  Emotionally.  She's aware enough that she knows that, you know, there will be some kind of book eventually.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, me and Anne still got to write a book.  Yeah.  I want to write a separate book.  But she's aware, but she's sort of hinted, like, can you maybe wait until, you know,  after I'm not around anymore?  Yeah.  I know that I feel bad because I'm not talking to him.  Like, he's not talking to me.  I'm sorry.  I didn't need to interrupt.  No, no, no.  No, you didn't really.  How much older is he than you?  Just a few years. 
[02:12:30]  Just basic?  Yeah, no.  He's like, what is he?  He's like 75, maybe?  Yeah.  He's relatively young now.  But in my mind, I went easy on him.  But it was still pretty gnarly.  Because, you know, it's hard when you write memoir stuff.  It's like, this is my life.  There are other people involved in it.  You know, how much are you going to...  What was the story that got him?  He just...  I don't even know if he read it.  You know, he talked to my brother and he claims that he didn't read it.  He hasn't watched the show or anything else.  But, you know, I put one of his crazy emails in there.  And, you know, I told this story about, you know, about his father's funeral that I was 
[02:13:00]  at, you know, and something he did.  And just, you know, I think I feel a little guilty, but, you know, I feel good about it.  Because, you know, there's part of me that thinks, like, this had to happen.  You know, now he knows I'm a separate person.  And now he knows that, you know, maybe...  I got to call him.  Let's do it on the air.  I got to call the guy.  Because, you know, when you do something, there's part of me that thinks, like, you  know, when you take, you do something and you realize, like, oh, fuck, there's no putting 
[02:13:30]  that back.  Right.  Yeah, that's done.  Does your brain ever slow down?  I know we've asked you over the years.  Yeah, yeah, it does.  Because there's always something going on in your head.  How do you get it to slow down and just, like, fucking chill?  Yeah, just lock in on porn.  Sometimes.  Yeah, some porn.  And it shuts down everything else that's going on.  Kind of.  Because you're a brilliant comic.  And one of the reasons, you really are.  And one of the reasons, you always got shit going on in your head.  Yeah, but it's always about me.  And sometimes I think that's draining. 
[02:14:00]  I feel like recently I've hit this wall where I'm doing the podcast, I'm doing my stand-up.  I'm like, I got to start watching television or something.  I'm doing something, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know how much crisis I can generate.  I was on stage in Buffalo and I had this moment where I'm like, I am so sick of hearing about  myself.  I can't fucking take it anymore.  Yeah.  And I said that to the audience.  I started a bit and I'm like, I can't do this.  And they're looking at me and most of them are my people.  And I'm like, I don't know what we're going to do right now.  And they're like, what the fuck is happening? 
[02:14:30]  And for like 45 seconds, I'm like, just wait this out.  Just wait it out.  That's awesome.  I would have loved to see that.  And they're just sitting there.  Nice.  But luckily, now enough people are familiar with me where they're like, yeah, he does  this sometimes.  But I was like, all right, all right, all right.  And then I sort of locked into talking about the buffalo wings or something.  But I'm just tired of it.  There are times where I envy Seinfeld.  It must be so nice because you obsess over yourself or I obsess over myself.  It must be so nice to just look at everything else and find them interesting. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  Like, I used to do politics.  I used to do everything.  And at some point, I'm like, you know, none of that matters because I'm the problem.  So let's talk about me as if I'm a country.  All right.  And now I'm getting to that point where I'm like exhausted.  It's exhausting.  It's very exhausting to always have to find new things to not only talk about, but find  the twist in and make funny and make interesting.  Right.  It's a very tough thing to do.  I got to start looking at other stuff like the Kardashian problem.  You know, yeah.  Yeah, once in a while, something else is interesting and it's hard. 
[02:15:30]  But I'm out of the dialogue.  I literally am so consumed on Twitter with fucking, you know, my shame parade on Twitter.  You know, engaging.  You do it too, but I mean, you seem to have more fortitude with it.  But, you know, I don't get like, I don't think I got the news about Paula Deen until  I saw your fucking Twitter feed.  I'm like, did something happen?  And I have to go over there and get caught up.  Like, I'm that detached.  Yeah, you need to like plug in a little bit.  What do you think of Paula Deen?  What do you think of that whole situation? 
[02:16:00]  Well, she's a little ignorant and very insensitive.  But it's something she did 30 years ago, man.  No, I mean, it's going to take a long time for people.  And it wasn't even that bad what she did.  Yeah, for people like her to culturally sort of grow up, I don't think that she hates black  people.  I don't think that she's a racist.  I just think she comes from a different time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, that's what I think on her.  I can't get enough of the tightrope guy.  Oh, that guy.  Who's going to be on our show tomorrow, by the way.  And Nick Willenda will be in studio.  Yeah, he'll be in here tomorrow.  You see the Grand Canyon wall?  We should put a piece of tape across and then clap while he walks. 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  Yeah, apparently Jesus did it.  Yeah.  Right?  You saw it, right?  I did.  Yeah.  That was amazing to watch.  It's fascinating.  Oh, Jesus.  Lord.  I don't know how the fuck they do it.  Thank you, Lord.  Thank you, Jesus.  But the sad thing about something like that is that if he did fall off, people have been  like, well, you know, it'd be a better show.  Yeah.  It happens.  What do you think was going to happen?  Imagine if his mantra...  That's what we were all half waiting for.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Completely.  But his mantra is, Jesus, I love you.  Thank you for the wind.  Imagine if his mantra was, eat a bag of shit.  Fuck your mother's cunt, you piece of garbage. 
[02:17:00]  Diamonds.  Diamonds.  You're halfway there.  It was all my inner dialogue.  That's pretty amazing shit, though.  But New York City shut him down.  We're not going to deal with his crap.  No.  He's not tightrope.  Well, I think Bloomberg, sort of, like, in New York in general, is like, do we need to  have problems we don't need to have?  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  There's enough shit going on.  Do we have to have, like, clutter the streets with this guy?  Yeah, we don't have to import problems, like, from the outside.  Well, the guy who did it between the towers, he did that completely.  Yeah, he did.  1974.  But that was in the days before, you know, like, you go up with your fucking equipment. 
[02:17:30]  It's like, no one stopped him?  He had to, he was set up a line.  He was bringing a whole tightrope into the Twin Towers.  No one stopped him?  They had to throw a line at him.  No, arrow.  No, they started with an arrow, and then they, ah, whatever.  I saw the documentary.  It was wonderful.  That's crazy.  No one's saying he would do the tightrope thing would be Buffalo.  Bring it back around.  If you could find a building that high.  Buffalo is begging for Nick.  Why'd he do the falls?  Well, they did the falls.  Oh, they did?  He did the falls, but they forced him to wear a safety wire. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I love the falls.  And it was on ABC.  I'm telling you, I think Buffalo, I had hot dogs excellent.  Can I tell you something?  What?  Go back to Niagara Falls in the winter when the whole thing's frozen.  Is that great?  Holy fuck.  It's really all frozen?  The whole thing freezes.  So no boat?  You just walk out there?  Can you walk on the water?  Not the whole thing, but I mean, the falls itself is frozen.  The water's still coming down.  Behind it, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The outer shell is frozen.  It's a rush, man.  It's a rush.  Did you go right to the side?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were on the boat.  We were on the boat.  No, up top, where you see the water. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And right at that fucking corner.  Right.  I have to fight the urge to jump.  Yes.  Isn't that weird?  You don't have that?  If I'm on a high building, you have that.  I think about it.  You're like, I think most people have that.  You don't, but you think like.  I really, the sad thing about me is I think if I were hanging off a building, that like  in my mind would be like, it's easier to let go.  Wow.  Like to climb back up.  Right.  Then they're like, oh, because then it's just, there's some part of me that's like, just  let go.  It's funny, that's the exact opposite reaction I have for everything in my life that's in 
[02:19:00]  turmoil.  And that's the proper reaction.  Just let go.  The only time you think of this on a building.  Oh, Mark, man.  That podcast is terrific, by the way.  Yes.  You're still going strong.  Oh, it's crazy.  400 episodes, good for you.  The Iggy Pop thing's pretty good.  Cheech and Chong on Thursday.  Yeah, you tell me a little bit about that behind the scenes here.  It was nice to hear.  I got to tell you something.  Listen, this fucking movie industry is crazy. 
[02:19:30]  Is crazy mean bad?  Yeah.  It's amazing that you, because you hear it's like, oh, this film cost it at a budget of  $50 million, $100 million.  And then you look, these people have been standing around milling about the hallways for hours.  And anytime I've been on a movie set, it's the same thing.  It's a lot of people, more people than it really seems like they need.  Yeah.  Milling about for hours.  Yeah, to shoot for two seconds. 
[02:20:00]  Yes.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Kenny?  They told a funny story about when Jim did his fight scene with Dominic.  Yes.  Yeah, how your pants kept falling down and they were seeing your fighting.  Yeah, yeah, I told him.  What show was that?  That was on Board of Death when Lombardozzi did that.  We kidnapped Jason Schwartz.  You got the same crew here?  They remember that?  One of the guys was on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  And I had to sign a nudity waiver.  The camera guy worked on Sling Blade.  Did he really?  Yeah, he was the camera guy from Sling Blade. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I was talking to him outside.  That's cool.  He said during the...  We have Carl on the board.  Get the fuck out!  Get the fuck out!  During that scene, he was looking at him, at the cameraman, and he came over later, Dwight  Yoakam, and said, like, I just needed someone to look at.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  He was, you know, pretty young back then.  He was 93 or something like that.  And he was like, why is he yelling at me?  We've got to wrap you, right?  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  Are they going to come in and shut up?  Yeah, they're going to come in.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, we're throwing you out, Mark.  We're not sure.  We have no idea, but just get the plug in just in case. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, the plug is the last two shows of my IFC show, Marin, are going to be on this Friday.  The book Attempting Normal is available.  Are you happy with book sales?  Yeah, everything's going pretty good.  Are people still buying books?  Yeah, kind of.  Kind of digitally downloading and stuff?  Yeah, it's going well.  People are liking the book.  The people that, the exciting thing about the book and the show is that there's a lot of people like,  I didn't know who the fuck you were.  You get in this bubble, you think, how could people not know who I am? 
[02:21:30]  Come on.  And then you're like, why would they know who I am?  Right.  But so, yeah, it's all going good.  Everything's fine.  Yeah, I'll be on Letterman on Wednesday soon.  Thanks for having me.  Absolutely.  I've been watching the roller coaster for a long time with you.  You're fucking blessed.  Thanks.  We love having you.  I have one plug.  Yes.  Antisocial.  The first show sold out.  It's myself, Amy Schumer, Artie Lang, and David Tell.  July 20th in the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  The second show is on sale and selling very well. 
[02:22:00]  So if you want to just go get tickets off Ticketmaster.  Okay.  Great.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Laughs.  Good times.  Good times.  Look at the little guy.  I got to piss desperately.  All right.  We might be back.  We don't know.  We don't know what the hell's going on with this big Chris Rock thing today.  What are people supposed to do?  I don't know.  They might come back.  It's like a tease, right?  They'll stick around or don't.  They're like, whatever.  We don't give a fuck.  Whatever.  All right.  We got it.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will return in a moment. 
[02:22:30]  After all, millions have to piss too.  And now back to The O.P. and Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  Oh, look at us.  We're back live?  Yeah.  We're back on there. 
[02:23:00]  Doesn't sound like my level is as high as it was with a monitor or something.  Is it the main monitor?  A little bit more?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can't.  We have some downtime.  Yeah.  Okay.  A little more?  That's good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We may only be on for a few minutes.  We don't know because we're just waiting for it.  Chris is shooting in another place.  Yes.  I get fucking very antsy and it's like...  What?  What's an update?  What?  Oh.  Hi, boss.  What's the update, Rich?  Oh, because he's getting...  Went to get some coffee. 
[02:23:30]  What's the update on what?  So they're going from there to the lobby?  Do we know?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  And let me tell you something.  That other DJ, I don't want to say names because we, you know, he's really good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's really good.  From OutKill?  And you know, you guys are natural actors because I've seen you guys and stuff before.  Now that I'm in that type of the business, you know.  Sure.  What are you even doing here?  Absolutely.  Are you loitering?  Yeah.  No.  It's called being a gaffer.  It's good.  So, you know, I'm trying to pull some strings, you know. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Please.  Please, if you're pulling a string, feel free to put one around your neck and then kick  out the chair.  Fucking Rich.  I can't believe Rich is walking around here like he's a part of this movie.  It fucking bugs me.  Rich should be standing here.  I did that thing for the thing Bonnie's doing.  What thing?  The thing.  All right.  Listen.  So, what are you talking about?  Her interview. 
[02:24:30]  Her interview?  What is that?  What are you talking about?  It's for her fucking, the documentary about chicks.  Yeah.  But what do you do?  What thing did you do?  I did an interview for her.  You did?  Shut up.  We found a salesman.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Cool.  So, here's the thing.  I mean, it's so hard to work on a movie.  Like, you know, I got to balance the movie.  With your lack of ability?  The movie is Saturday.  I mean, he can sign it. 
[02:25:00]  It's so hard to balance everything.  Absolutely.  Sure.  You know, Friday at Marissa's.  And so, or next week at, you know, Heart for Funny Bone.  So, what I'm trying to do is balance everything.  I had to cancel therapy this morning.  Oh, man.  I had to cancel yesterday, doctor appointment.  Canceling therapy is not going to hurt, really.  It's going nowhere.  Okay.  And I also had to cancel my one-on-one at the Apple store because, you know.  What do you got going on there?  Well, I bought a new MacBook Pro.  Oh.  And for a hundred bucks, you get unlimited one-on-one sessions for a year. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, so what are you just going on?  Or if you have a friend, you could just call them.  You're going to sit down and teach me editing?  Okay?  I can't even get you to text me back.  What do you got, Final Cut Pro?  Okay, you fucking asshole.  You got Final Cut?  Is that what you're working on?  Not yet.  I'm going to build the Final Cut.  Yes.  You know, so, you know, there's so much going on.  You know, the old voice is no way.  Listen to me.  What?  You know, I'm a new guy.  Really?  Yeah.  You're in the same ancient body then. 
[02:26:00]  That's right.  Exactly.  Unfortunately, the new brain hasn't showed up yet.  This show is so falling apart.  During the show, you lose part of your cast.  That's not happening out here in the movie.  The cast is here.  You know what I mean?  No, I don't.  We don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, I just saw a camera go by.  I guess they're taking it to the lobby.  We don't know what they're doing, so we didn't want to, you know, go up on it to get some  coffee.  I just don't.  I crash after the show.  Like, I literally fucking, I lose all information, like all motivation. 
[02:26:30]  I want to be talking up until we can stop talking and then relax a bit and then come  right back in and talk.  So you crash twice in a day.  What are you saying, Rich?  I don't dwell there.  Crash after the show.  I do.  I fucking lose my energy.  Shut up.  I do.  Please.  You have the energy of Helena.  Who's Helena?  The girl with no arms and legs from the movie.  Don't go for the smart references.  Oh, wow.  Just say you have the energy of Elise.  Damn.  Helena was a good fucking, was a good reference. 
[02:27:00]  It wasn't.  You know what?  I bet we will never hear.  Rich Voss, come quick.  We need you.  Yeah.  You're close up, Mr. Voss.  You guys can make fucking jokes, but you have no idea.  Unfortunately, you can't.  Here's another thing.  What?  I don't like you motherfuckers jumping on the goddamn podcast bandwagon all of a sudden.  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah.  In the top five every week.  Like what?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We got some subscribers, huh?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Is it you guys doing it or is this the best of your show?  It's fucking stupid. 
[02:27:30]  It's a bunch of old shit.  I don't know why people even subscribe.  It's old stuff.  That's a good way to sell it.  No, it's the stuff we just don't really play on here anymore.  We do little intros.  Oh, are they calling you, Rich?  No, I just got really bored.  Exactly.  He walked up.  No, they're not calling him.  That's the problem.  He's been off set for a while and no one has noticed.  So he's going to fucking meander back and go, hey, guys, I'm still here.  Hi, guys.  Nothing proves your lack of value than when they move to a new set and don't tell you.  Don't tell you and don't notice. 
[02:28:00]  Coffee, Mr. Rock?  Yeah.  How many times have you walked back to where the cameras were and they're gone and you've  got to go find them?  That's not a man who's needed on set.  You don't even have a headset.  Oh, yeah, you do.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, great.  You don't even have a chin.  Does it have a microphone?  It doesn't have a microphone?  No.  No, it's not.  It's to hear what's going on.  Exactly.  He's not the guy that's actually saying things.  It's like when somebody brings their kid to work.  You have no idea.  No, it's like when the director brings his child.  They sit him up and they pull him a headset.  Yes, exactly.  His little feet can swing and he can watch the fucking monitor. 
[02:28:30]  I see people walking around and they're talking to other people.  Very important.  Guys, out of all the years I've come in here, they're nothing but good radio.  Instead of tearing down, it should be built.  Hey, that's great.  You're working on this fucking movie.  Will you all tell us what you're doing?  You want him to tell us what you're doing in the movie?  I'd love to see you in the movie.  I've got to ask him online to tell what I'm doing.  You know, sometimes, you know, it just, you know, it's like the Woody Allen thing.  Woody Allen doesn't want people to know what's going on.  These pretzels are making me thirsty. 
[02:29:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Like Woody Allen.  What?  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  What I'm saying is, how about one day, when I come in tomorrow, if I can squeeze it in,  let's do pro-rich boss, not negative.  Yes, yes.  You know, like pro, like pretend I'm calling or somebody with talent.  All right.  Oh, fucking Bobby.  This is Rich Voss.  I'm not DeRosa.  Hey.  You know, you fucked, you know, you're done fucking with him, and now we got new guys 
[02:29:30]  to fuck with.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  You know, I built up some seniority around here.  All right, Rich.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, Rich.  So a little respect, maybe.  A little respect.  I deserve respect!  Yeah, exactly.  I'd do you guys in an army.  Send Rich Voss to the airport!  I was stepped over!  It's because you're short.  Are you meeting fucking Wrangler Jane later?  Oh, nothing.  Why?  That was a great, uh...  Wow.  All right.  All right, Chip.  See ya. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, is that what that was?  All right, that wasn't that bad.  Fucking Rich.  I don't know.  He's probably writing stuff.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's written stuff for Christmas for.  But it was cute to see him standing up here on the chair.  But the reason I wanted to come back, besides the fact I just get...  I don't want to stagnate, is this fucking ant blew me away.  Oh.  Blew me away.  Yeah, I did.  I was good at it.  He came in my mouth, everything.  Absolutely.  And I wanted to get blown at home, too.  That's isolated.  Yes.  But the TWA 800 movie is a documentary on Epyx. 
[02:30:30]  It's coming out, what, July 17th?  I want to guess.  17th or something.  The anniversary.  27th, something with a 7.  Yeah.  But I saw the preview copy that we have.  Oh, boy, we had the whole movie.  So Jim watched it, and he said, wow, this really makes you think that something else happened  besides this main fuel tank explosion because of a mechanical failure.  And I'm like, yeah, I've heard that before, but blah, blah, blah.  Boy, this really did a good job of presenting another side of what happened, or what might 
[02:31:00]  have happened.  There's a lot of iffy fucking areas they enter there.  It seems a lot of the witnesses saw at least one, two, if not three missiles come from the  water, come up, and hit the plane, or at least explode near the plane.  Which then rolled over and crashed into the water.  And now all this evidence was being manipulated by certain people because the FBI and CIA were 
[02:31:30]  involved in the investigation.  I guess because they thought it might have been terrorism at first.  A lot of weird things with evidence going to other places to be tested when it didn't  need to, and disappearing.  People that were experts that were just blown off.  Testimony from witnesses that was ignored.  Yeah.  And for what reason?  Like, I was trying to think, all right, what, why would they do this? 
[02:32:00]  If it's terrorism from another country, you would think they would want that out there.  Especially after all this time, sure.  If it was an accident, a military, US military accident launching missiles from a naval ship  perhaps, that would be so hard to cover up.  Really hard to cover up.  I mean, think about it.  I'm not talking the guys that are commanders or something.  There's some fucking sailor in his bunk as they're shooting off a missile on one of these  ships.  You know a missile's going off. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  So then he sees in the news that a plane was down, he hears all this scuttlebutt about  a crash.  He's not going to tell his girlfriend or his family or something like that.  The whole ship would know.  It's just too, there's too many people that would know.  Again, the downfall of every conspiracy.  Too many people would know.  Not enough people would keep their fucking mouth shut.  Yep.  So, how does this fit in?  How is this some type of missile attack?  And how are they able to keep it so quiet? 
[02:33:00]  My guess is, shoulder launched by one or two people, and maybe the reason they kept  it quiet is because they don't want people who do it to see how possible and easy it was  to do.  Well then, why the fuck wasn't it done again?  Because they may have caught the guys who did it quickly.  Or they may have been able to shut up.  But, you know, most of the public might not know that it's that easy to do.  You would think if terrorists launched some Stinger missiles at this thing, they would 
[02:33:30]  be like, this is the greatest thing.  We just got to go out on a fucking rowboat off of the coast where there's an airport  and shoot these things down.  You'd think in all these years, what is it, 15 years or whatever it is?  No, it's longer than that.  20 years.  That they would have tried it again.  Someone would have.  It's just, I like the way they went through the facts and the testimony from these guys  and the witnesses and everything.  But the one thing missing is a motive for a cover-up and who did this and what happened. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, I mean, they may not have those answers.  And I kind of like the fact that they didn't pretend they did have those answers.  They don't know exactly what it was.  But, you know, the fact that a lot of these people who were towing the company line would  not come on and be interviewed.  I get the president and the vice president.  But, you know, guys like Kellerman from the FBI and all these other guys that would not  be interviewed for this.  It's like, why?  Why wouldn't you if the public is so concerned about it?  That was a pretty amazing part of the movie.  It was right at the end where they just list all the people that wouldn't be interviewed for 
[02:34:30]  this.  And pretty important people as far as the investigation goes.  And you would think they would want to know and be involved in any investigation that might  bring the truth out.  But they weren't talking.  And that shitty CIA animation of the nose falling off.  Yeah, now I bought that up until I saw this fucking documentary yesterday.  I bought that scenario.  And then as you're watching it in this documentary, you feel stupid for thinking that's what happened. 
[02:35:00]  It's odd.  And they do describe it like a 747, the main fuel tank blows up.  The fucking nose comes off.  You'd think with the speed.  And now it's like a fucking pipe going through the air.  It would just rip it apart.  And then it proceeds to climb.  4,000 more feet.  No one saw the plane climbing.  Everyone just saw a fireball coming down.  The witness testimony is amazing because it's so consistent from one to another. 
[02:35:30]  And they have no reason to lie.  There's no motive to lie.  So that was an odd part.  The hush-hush on part of the FBI and CIA, that's kind of the way they operate with everything.  So you can't take every bit of secrecy in there and think it's something sinister.  But the things they didn't do is pretty compelling.  Not interviewing.  Not actually taking into consideration what the witnesses said. 
[02:36:00]  Another thing that was huge is the fact that the medical examiner and some of the crash forensics people  weren't able to draw any conclusions in their report.  They were told to just report it.  Just write it down.  Hand it over.  Hand over what you have to the FBI.  And then their analysts will analyze all the evidence that you've gotten.  And none of them said that ever happened like that.  They would get the evidence and then come up with a conclusion based on what they had found 
[02:36:30]  and said, this is what I believe happened.  They were told, no, don't do that.  Just fucking give us your findings and we'll draw a conclusion.  We'll draw the conclusion.  And these are NTSB people who were involved.  These are not fucking lunatics.  It's their job is plane crashes.  Yeah, it's what they do.  When a plane crashes, they fucking investigate it.  They've been doing it for decades.  And then they were told, no, you're not in this one.  You know, we'll handle it. 
[02:37:00]  Well, that one piece that went to NASA and got tested, there was something found on the wing.  A certain pattern that had to happen at a certain time.  Before the wing came apart.  Before it came apart.  And then the guy's like, why didn't you put this in the report?  And the guy who was kind of defending the official lines, I don't know why I didn't tell you.  He had no answer for it.  He was like, that's a big piece of fucking information.  Why wouldn't you say that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Oh, look at perfect again.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you.  Techie.  I wanted Starbucks, but I didn't specify that.  Thank you.  You're taking... 
[02:37:30]  You're not blaming her for that?  How is she?  Was she a mind reader?  Come on.  She's just a young lady doing her job.  Yeah, what are you doing?  And at least she's doing her job.  You're just sitting there.  That's my job.  Never get dunking down.  Fucking lumping around.  Lumping around.  Yeah.  I've been getting Starbucks for like 10 years.  Exactly.  That's why I love Jackie, because she says Jim might like something different.  And she mixes it up for me.  Exactly.  Jim has never liked anything different.  No.  He's very straight.  Oh.  That's why she brings me out of my shell.  She is a joy. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah?  A joy.  I want a delight to have around this building.  The way she breezes in here and she changes us all.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, I just wonder...  A delight.  It seems to be direct favoritism.  No, not at all.  What a lovely young lady.  Anybody that can take me out of my comfort zone really challenges me.  You like that?  I love it.  It really challenges me.  So, yeah, I'm glad you felt that way, because I was like, fuck man, because I was like,  I don't know what it was, but I'm like, this is really hard to say that something was  not shot up, because all of these people are not... 
[02:38:30]  And you don't need a crazy, like, 9-11 conspiracy theorist.  You need all these...  There's nobody I really respect that was involved in the investigation saying this shit.  These are people who...  And in 93, the internet was nothing like it is now, so information wasn't thrown around.  There's no footage of it.  Yeah, unfortunately for this film, because I went into it like...  A doubting Thomas.  Yes, I was a doubting Thomas.  I went into it like, you know, fuck this, all right, I'll put it on and, you know, see  what it's about.  And, man, it did. 
[02:39:00]  It did just grab me.  I was like, okay, there's something to this.  But unfortunately, because of things like loose change and these fucking mental patients  that just deny the evidence that's right in front of them, I think this might get lumped  into that, and people might think that before they see it, and be like, oh, fuck you.  It's difficult to be a conspiracy theorist for one theory.  Right, yes, yes.  It's hard to say.  No, I think for the most part, everything is as it's reported, except this one. 
[02:39:30]  But that makes sense, though, because that's how it is.  That's more logical.  You don't need to say every conspiracy is right.  And this is, like, instantly credible to me, because Anthony is the last one that's ever  going to...  I don't like that it wasn't credible when I said it, but I do understand that, since I'm  the one that kind of brought up...  Oh, Jim's got another one of his theories.  I bought the company line on this one where, you know...  I did, too.  And it was the CIA's version of what happened, which is so odd.  Like, what the fuck is the CIA doing poking around in a civilian aviation crash that was 
[02:40:00]  deemed not terrorism, not a crime in that sense?  And they're the ones making up the animation.  And all these, not so much subliminal, because that sounds like this weird kind of weird trying  to brainwash you, but there were certain key phrases and graphics that were put up, like  when they would say, not a missile, and just reiterate that over and over again, in a 
[02:40:30]  way, kind of like telling you, you know, hey, don't even consider the missile aspect of  this.  It's not.  Because we told you.  They found the explosive material on the inside of the plane on certain chairs where it would  have been...  And their explanation for that was that they had been doing a bomb-sniffing drill a week  earlier or whatever, but then when they really get into it, they're like, they don't list  the plane, they just say a plane, and they say the bomb-sniffing drill, if it was this  plane that they did it on, would have had to end 15 minutes before takeoff, which is 
[02:41:00]  just not the way it works.  Which, of course, the crew needs just about, give or take a few, an hour prep time, and  it didn't work out time-wise.  They would have had to left with the explosive and the dog and everything within 15 minutes  of when the plane had to leave, which is impossible.  So, that didn't work out, and again, when you've got the CIA and FBI involved in something  like this, they can say and change anything, really.  Anything they want.  But aren't you worried now that you're like, okay, they lied to me about this, maybe they 
[02:41:30]  lied to me about that.  I don't know, but sometimes you think I don't know.  There's no footage.  I don't have footage that I can watch over and over again.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And Silver are going to be the best of friends now.  I know, right?  The fucking donkers, dude.  That's who fucking did it.  I don't understand how you can, just because Jim likes this documentary, you can give this  documentary so much credence, but you can't explain the Pentagon. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, it's obviously a missile that went into the Pentagon.  Yeah, all that shit.  When they just discount the fact that there are fuselage pieces from an American airline  plane on the fucking lawn.  I don't think even those are just pieces of something.  I'm just asking questions.  We don't really know what happened.  Oh, yeah.  How come they didn't find any engine pieces?  They did.  Here's the fucking, here's part of the engine. 
[02:42:30]  Here's the fucking blades.  The turbine blades.  I mean, you don't know.  Here's the answer for that.  Oh, come on, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Exactly.  That is the answer.  They just say, like, nah, nothing happened.  Plus there's radar of the stuff blowing off.  Oh, fuck.  They're fucking DS brothers.  Give them the keys for the fucking plane.  This is the, uh, and there was that, the radar debris that they show that blew off at  a certain speed.  Yeah, yeah.  At Mach 4. 
[02:43:00]  I think the difference on this one is, you're like, okay, this is making me question the  explanation.  Right.  And I don't have any evidence that, that explains this.  Right.  Whereas with all, like, the 9-11 stuff, you give them, okay, here's exactly what explains  this.  Or, the logical part is now easier to believe than the conspiracy theory part, but those  theorists are just going, no, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, the 9-11 stuff, it's like, you have to take such a leap to go from, we had Arab 
[02:43:30]  terrorists, well-financed, long planning, went into this, that hijacked planes and flew  them into various buildings, killing a lot of people and destroying buildings.  That's one scenario.  The other one is, that for years, an explosives crew was working around in operating buildings  with walls and everything, wiring it for a fucking planned, controlled demolition with  secretaries and fucking financiers.  Also, there's a plane full of people on their way to Washington, D.C. that are just on Lost 
[02:44:00]  Island somewhere.  Right, they put them on the Lost Island.  Yeah.  And you're supposed to now throw away the easy explanation, the logical one, the one  that doesn't have one thing in it that really doesn't make sense, and accept this amazing  story of conspiracy.  Fake phone calls.  Things, fake phone calls, and yeah, something that a James Bond movie wouldn't attempt.  And now the Flight 800 thing doesn't present you with this bizarre, unbelievable scenario that 
[02:44:30]  could have happened, and a simple one.  They're both equally as viable, and with the evidence and then lack of evidence, you do  steer closer to the one with the missile than you do the exploding center fuel tank.  A couple of guys with Stinger missiles, whatever the shoulder launch ones are, and the reason  for keeping it quiet is because if you show that that works, A, it panics the public in  a horrendous way.  And baby, by the way, that's how you get maybe, people say, how do you get the airline 
[02:45:00]  industry to sign off on that, a lie, and say that it's an explosion when it's really a  Stinger missile?  Because the point of the airline industry may be, what will happen if this comes out that  it was a missile, is airline business will plunge beyond repair.  An explosion, people know is an ultra, ultra rare event, but if you all of a sudden fucking  announce publicly that Stinger missiles can take down airlines, you're going to lose 40% 
[02:45:30]  of your business.  No matter how rare a missile being fired at a commuter airplane is, the fact that it's  a possibility would make people stop going.  And maintenance can't fix that.  Maintenance can fix whatever this problem was.  People understood intuitively the 747s are older planes.  It never happened before.  All right, this is a fluke.  A missile in this day and age?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  That's amazing.  So maybe that's why people say why the airline industry signed on.  That could be a motive for the airline industry to have taken the hit and said, okay, we're 
[02:46:00]  taking this evil instead of this horrible evil.  But now the airline industry, who is that that now has to be in collusion with the FBI  and CIA?  Who's the person?  Did they even talk to anybody?  They.  Maybe somebody at Boeing.  Yeah, yeah.  Boeing has to, somebody at Boeing has to go, look, I could be sacrificing this entire company  right now if this gets out and they figure that I and Boeing as a company was involved  in this kind of conspiracy against American people. 
[02:46:30]  Well, you're talking a company ruining problem there.  But again, it's never said, you know, maybe it's done much.  So maybe the FBI and CIA, what do you think that Boeing can talk to them if the NTSB can't?  They may say, this is our conclusions.  You know, there's ways to say things without implicating yourselves.  And I know this is conspiracy shit, but that does make sense to me as to what the motive  would be of the airline industry for not fighting it completely or demanding public.  They may not have been said, hey, look, guys, this is what it is. 
[02:47:00]  But they may have said, well, let's hope it's not a stinger missile because that's going  to cost the airline industry 40 percent of your revenue in the next 10 years.  You know, you know, another odd thing you would think, all right, they want a cover  up story.  They go with the center fuel tank exploding story.  Why then don't they just go the whole route and come up with the conclusion there?  It's it was an inconclusive ignition source.  They said the center fuel tank exploded, but they never really had a conclusion as to what 
[02:47:30]  ignited it.  Now, what's the reasoning for them not having the end game?  The story like it was a short circuit on this fucking wire that blew that.  They were like, yeah, the center fuel tank ignited, but we have no evidence of anything.  We're not sure.  We sorry.  Because if it's vague, it's harder to disprove.  Like there was a guy that said, very good.  There was one guy who said, well, that in order for that to ignite, you would need this  many amps.  Right.  And there's nothing with that many amps in the center fuel.  Like there was a there are people that know. 
[02:48:00]  So if you put it on a look, it's wire 72 to me and you.  That's like, well, that's the game.  But the people in that industry, they're like, no, no, no.  Cunt face.  Right.  Wire 72 eats a bag of dicks and could never have done.  There's too many people that little element of deniability in there.  Yes.  Well, we think it was.  And that's good enough for the public.  But you give 100 percent specific and somebody can absolutely go.  No, no.  You're lying.  Smoking gun is a lie.  Wow.  Very good.  Because that's a part that got me to it's like they made this whole story, but left out 
[02:48:30]  the part that lit the whole thing.  Sure.  And they had to admit that they didn't know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had to admit that.  The final hearing there, they finally went.  Yeah.  They said, we don't know.  Sorry.  And this is all.  And again, it could have just been a couple of handhelds.  Or, you know, I mean, I'm not saying the government did it.  Because don't forget, they may have they've gone after Stinger missiles and people selling  them after that hardcore.  Yeah.  They may have just kept that stuff a little quieter for the reason that they couldn't  keep 9-11 quiet.  You'd think they would have been very petrified that it would happen again. 
[02:49:00]  It would be obvious that it this time was a missile that took down a plane.  And now you have to explain what happened to the 747 because the similarities are so similar  that they now can't use that center tank.  And then you find out that they knew, did nothing to defend the people against the Stinger  missiles.  Now you're opening yourself up for a lot more damage than just saying, oh my God, people,  Stinger missiles.  Yeah, you are. 
[02:49:30]  But again, there's also that.  And I know that they showed exactly how that hard rudder snapped in the American Airlines flight  in November of 2001.  But under the same logic, how do you get the airline industry to implicate themselves instead  of a terrorist?  Let's just say that was the first shoe bomb.  Let's say that was some kind of an onboard device after 9-11.  The airline industry may have said a mechanical failure in this case is much less damaging  than realizing we've been targeted again and got hit again. 
[02:50:00]  They may have looked at, all right, X amount of lawsuits for this compared to $6 billion in  lost revenue.  Right.  Because people will just start taking the fucking train.  Well, they'll start flying JetBlue, which doesn't have an American.  Who knows what the thinking is?  But that's, that's to me how you get a big business to fucking sign on to taking a bit  of a hit.  But you would think somebody in that conference room would eventually say something.  It may never be said like that.  It may never be in a conference room. 
[02:50:30]  It literally may be the one or two people that need to make that decision at the airline  or at Boeing where you say this is, it could be this or it could be that.  Well, you're basically telling them something, but you're not telling them.  I understand what you mean, but there is this just faith that you have that no one's going  to talk.  And then, and then the, the conclusion that they don't like that to me is the most amazing  part of any conspiracy.  It's so hard to keep your fucking yap shut about anything. 
[02:51:00]  The government can't stop whistleblowers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know, they have a few people, but they've kept some stuff quiet.  Like there are, you're right, but there are, there are things that when there's only a  few people that know and they're in that line of work, they can keep people in the FBI  and the CIA, there's a million things they've never talked about.  Yeah.  The whistleblowers make it look like nothing safe, but there's enough shit that they've  kept quiet when only the right people know.  I mean, look at how long fucking certain people have gotten away with certain things. 
[02:51:30]  And then you're like, oh my, like Bernie Madoff, look at how long he pulled off what  he pulled off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Until the market started shitting the bed, but no one blew the whistle on him.  Even though he was, you know what I mean?  He fucking had to tell his sons, blow the whistle on me so you're not implicated.  Such a, such a, conspiracies are, the facts and everything, it could all add up, but that  human element is the, the, the, the weak link in the, in the chain.  It's, it's.  And that's what drives you crazy because you get all wrapped up in them and you're like,  okay, yeah, that works, that works, that works, that works.  And then you find the one thing in the whole theory. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  It just blows up.  Yeah.  You have to be willing to let that happen too.  And that's where conspiracy theorists lose me is the one piece of legit evidence they  don't go with or the one piece of nonsense in their theory.  They don't just discount.  They become married to the agenda.  And I just, all those people saying they saw something shooting up at that plane.  Every one of them could not have a mass hallucination.  Yeah, that, that was the most compelling part of the documentary.  If you ask me, is that the witnesses saying that they saw something coming up at the plane 
[02:52:30]  and it wasn't a fiery color.  It was bright white, they were saying, almost a silvery, uh, that you would get out of a rocket engine, uh, coming up, not, not at a certain point in the sky.  It was coming up from the fucking ground, from the horizon, from the level of, of that.  So it wasn't in the sky, it wasn't another plane, it wasn't, uh, the other plane giving an illusion 
[02:53:00]  because it's flying toward you that it's going up a little bit.  Uh, how do you just throw that out as an investigator?  It just, to me, seems, uh, like that's a very important part of the fucking...  And it was a four-year investigation.  So I think that if there's any type of a cover-up or any type of a...  I think it's with, with very few people and with plausible deniability.  And again, in this one, because they never said this is exactly what it is.  Yeah.  They haven't left themselves a smoking gun. 
[02:53:30]  And what about, uh, I'm reading some of the questions down here, uh, taking credit.  Why hasn't anyone taken credit for this?  You get a terrorist organization that got its hands on stinger-fucking missiles.  And shot down one of the biggest planes that fly, full of Americans, um, ah, and French.  You know, I know that.  Um, why wouldn't you be fucking tooting your horn like, look at what we did.  Take credit and try to do it again.  Yeah, and we're gonna, yeah, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  And it's scary.  I mean, terrorism works on the act and the fear that it makes.  If they said, and we have more and we're gonna do it again, you ruin the airline industry.  You can't allow a cover-up.  No.  Maybe they, uh, maybe it was an offshoot group and maybe they, uh, they rounded up who was responsible relatively quickly.  That seems.  Or maybe they were Americans.  Maybe they were Americans who were not doing it for foreign terror.  Who the fuck knows?  Maybe somebody on that flight was targeted.  Nah, but then again, you wouldn't know which plane that was.  That's probably bullshit.  Yeah, it's just, it seems to me that the people that are keeping quiet would talk. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  And the people that would talk are keeping quiet.  It's, uh, it doesn't, it, on a human level, it doesn't make sense.  Yeah, I don't, I, to be honest, that's a good question about why wouldn't they take credit?  Unless, didn't you say, like, unless it was some weird coincidental, like, government testing thing that accidentally, blah, blah, blah.  No, I think they would admit to that.  I think, yes.  Somebody would admit to that if we did that by mistake?  Somebody would admit to it, yeah, because, and I don't think the airline industry would sign off on that. 
[02:55:00]  I don't think the airline industry.  Oh, because they'd know it's your fault, not our fault.  Yeah.  You're going to get blamed on this.  And that won't hurt our business.  Right.  A government mistake, that never happens.  People would still fly.  Right.  But a fucking Stinger missile would, would shut down business.  Yeah, I just wonder what the purpose of it was, if that's what it was.  Yeah, yeah, like, who would do that?  Why wouldn't you take credit if you were doing it on purpose?  Was there any kind of revenge?  When did the U.S. shoot down that Iranian plane by mistake?  There was an Iranian passenger, can we look it up, there was an Iranian passenger plane shot down by the United States over the ocean. 
[02:55:30]  And they shot, it was a horrifying death, they shot one of the wings off, and then another missile went off.  Whoops.  And as it fell, people on the ship were going, oh my God, that's a passenger plane.  Yeah.  That was 88.  88.  So five years earlier.  No, it wasn't the TWA 93.  93.  Which ship was that?  The Carl Vinson?  What, what's, but still you'd think that they, yeah, someone would take credit.  Like, you don't just do that and then keep it quiet.  Right.  Who knows how many people it was, though?  Like, they just killed 10 people on a mountain in Pakistan and immediately took credit for it. 
[02:56:00]  It's also easier to get stuff out now than it is.  That's true.  20 years ago.  Now it's much easier to get out your information than it was, Al Jazeera didn't exist 20 years ago, I don't think.  And, you know what I mean?  It was a little bit of a slower trigger pull to an action to when everybody knew about it.  There was still a lapse in time.  You think there's, like, an admission tape stuck in the mail somewhere?  Oh, man, right.  It got sent to the wrong person. 
[02:56:30]  To the bottom of CNN's mail bin.  We never opened this.  Yeah, someone named Alfred Akbar.  Throw it out.  What the hell could this be?  Again, this is all who knows, but I think it was a little harder to get immediate information out.  And the FBI and CIA, who knows?  They may have already had information that this type of thing was happening, and they may have already been looking at certain people,  and then it just got snuck under their radar and happened.  Who the fuck knows what was going on?  The speculation that goes into something like this, I mean, it's never-ending.  But none of that stuff is that crazy. 
[02:57:00]  No, no.  The actual facts and the interviews and everything isn't that crazy.  It's the speculation that has to be put in to support some of it.  And that's where it gets crazy, you know?  All right, missile.  You don't just fucking come up with missiles.  They have to come from somewhere.  You know, these things.  And there's a paper trail, information trail, a money trail as to what's going on, you know?  Where this came from.  That it would seem like somebody could get a hold of it. 
[02:57:30]  It would seem like you could trace a missile.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At least to some extent.  Something, you know?  Right, right.  Maybe they did.  Maybe.  Or at least there is a lost missile.  I guess that must be it.  That could be our lost missile.  That's the one we lost.  God damn it.  And there's no reason for them to come out now and say it.  It's dead.  The official explanation, it's done.  Well...  Maybe they shut down whatever pipeline they had to, you know, whatever was happening with  that.  Who knows?  I mean, again, if all those people didn't see it, I wouldn't think this.  You do need a motive to not give the American people the correct answer to it. 
[02:58:00]  Because they just can't come out and go, we lied.  They just won't do that.  Well, now it's really fucked up.  I mean...  Right.  Someone may now.  Now you'd be like, ah, yeah, we lied.  What?  It would fuck.  Yeah.  Now you get the...  You gotta get the heat for it actually happening and for lying about it.  And for lying about it.  That's double punishment.  But you have a double punishment.  But you have enough people talking about it who are legitimate, who were involved in 
[02:58:30]  the investigation.  So, it's really hard just to write off.  And so many people have said, well, experts have said that that didn't happen, this couldn't  happen, that.  It's like, experts, they could be lying too, you know?  Which is wrong.  Experts.  Or wrong.  It's just a person.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd love to get people from the documentary or somebody in.  Maybe we can after it airs.  I thought it was very well done.  It wasn't, uh, I never felt like I was watching some kooky fucking internet conspiracy thing. 
[02:59:00]  And fucking Lee Harvey Oswald, you could see, photoshopped in his foot.  And then, okay, whatever.  Yeah, they're using some radar evidence, which they had, but that's another thing.  Why did they have to fucking sue to get all the information?  Yeah.  They had to sue to get every piece of information on a domestic fucking freak engine.  Oh, that's just it.  Why?  When you get fucking, uh, the CIA and FBI involved, you know, you get all the redacted 
[02:59:30]  paperwork, and if you do get it, and then you get the, uh, denials of getting anything.  I think they do that on purpose, just so when they really do have something they don't want  you to see, it's like, oh, they do that with everything.  But nobody was plugging Infowars.com throughout the documentary?  Uh, obviously a conspiracy.  You could tell, uh, it wasn't the main fuel tank.  It's gotta be a missile.  He would be interesting on this one, though, because he put it in.  See the evidence right there on Infowars.com?  False flag, uh, false flag operation to bring down the, uh, thing. 
[03:00:00]  It was in order to get us in a war with Mexico.  What?  Huh?  We should tomorrow, probably, because, yeah, I would love to talk to Alex.  Or maybe, or maybe, when more people have seen the, the, the.  Oh, yeah, why tomorrow?  How great would it be if we called him, and he was like, no, no, no, the official story.  Yeah.  Is the story on that one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a Stanger missile.  Could you, yeah, if you see, no, it was fuel tank.  Yeah, fuel tank blew up.  That was short circuit, blew up the plane, uh, no, no, it's not a missile. 
[03:00:30]  The conspiracy there is the documentary being made.  Conspiracy's the conspiracy.  Conspiracy.  And those fucking bodies, how some were intact, and some were mangled, when they all should  have been, if it was a Stanger fuel tank, all the bodies should have been fucked up in  that area, and they weren't.  They show some of those bodies on the documentary.  Oh, my God.  And even the x-rays they were showing, like, they have an x-ray, and they showed some metal  fragments inside the body, but also what you could see are, like, ribs that are just  completely smashed and tangled up. 
[03:01:00]  I feel so bad for the people that had to fall.  Ooh.  There's no way you think you're living through that.  You don't want to do that.  Imagine being in the very, because if you were, like, say, in the last row of coach, you were  unaffected by those explosions.  Yeah.  You died when you hit the ground.  You're like, wah.  That's always something that stuck out with 9-11 to me, was the people that were falling.  Same thing.  Out of the building.  Do you have a fraction of an element of, like, I might make this.  I might stick this landing.  Or, like, you're falling and being like, oh, I could have done something differently. 
[03:01:30]  Ah, look.  There was a rope right there.  Well, that's the thing.  Well, we had the dude from the bridge documentary on it.  Oh, yeah.  We said he jumped off the bridge, and he said the first thing you think about as you're  falling is, this was a horrible mistake.  Oh, this probably wasn't good.  Yeah, you don't want to think that.  Yeah, but they were driven out of the building like animals.  Like, it was an instinct thing to get away from a thousand degree heat or whatever.  Yeah, that's not.  You've got to make that decision.  It's not a conscious decision. 
[03:02:00]  In that kind of heat, you just jump.  It's too much.  You just have to move away from the heat no matter what's.  I would just stick my head out the window.  What's there?  Yeah.  That's all that would be left.  But you know what I mean?  It's like the agony of being on fire.  Yeah.  Or being slowly baked.  It's almost like as you're falling, I'm sure that, but I don't think they, you seem like  an animal at that point.  Like, it's just, it's instinct and primal fire.  Fire!  Fire is horrible.  It stinks.  Oh, it hurts.  You've had time to think about it.  When, when, like you're saying in this crash, you know, you're, you're sitting in your, 
[03:02:30]  in your seat one minute and then the next minute you're, you're going to fall into the ocean.  But you're falling 13 times the distance that they fell.  That's a long fall.  And you can't, you, you, you, you have no reason to be falling.  Like, you're not in physical distress yet.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  You're just falling.  You were just watching a movie.  I think some guy is just sitting there with his legs crossed reading like SkyMall.  Licking his finger, turning the pages.  I'll go down in order. 
[03:03:00]  People looking at him like, what the fuck is he doing?  Yeah, yeah.  Like the fucking band on the Titanic.  Right.  You imagine the fucking scene in front of that plane gone.  There's no convincing yourself you're going to live.  Still eating that tiny little salad with the green and the one tomato in it.  Maybe the pilot can bring this in.  You know, you've got to always have this element of, I don't know, maybe it won't hit so hard.  Pushing the stewardess button.  Excuse me.  You're just falling straight.  To see the pilots falling off the front. 
[03:03:30]  Oh.  You imagine seeing the, because by, by, numerically, there had to be one row that was alive that was closest to the opening.  Looking like, oh, that's interesting.  The whole fucking flight deck just ripped away from this plane.  Huh.  I don't think that's supposed to happen.  Do you think they did get ripped open quickly?  Because you don't think they just fucking fell, like, with the tube?  You think that the wind ripped it apart?  I would assume if the front of a plane comes off at cruising speed.  They were just getting up to that. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, they were just getting up.  They were 13,000 climbing.  13,000 feet on that.  They're doing a couple hundred.  They're going pretty fucking fast.  You would think that open tube with air rushing in, the pressure would blow it apart.  You would assume the pressure would blow it apart.  You hope that people died or passed out.  Yeah.  You hope so.  I'm sure there were some heart attacks and some passed out, but I'm sure some people were there.  Some real fucking hardcore people that are just like, oh, fuck, I'm still, this is great.  The only thing I have to compare to that is being in the front row of a roller coaster when you're about to go over the hump. 
[03:04:30]  You think you go wee?  No, but I'm saying, like, yeah.  Hands up.  Where's the camera?  I want to make a face.  Let me rephrase your question.  I have nothing to compare this to.  That's terrible.  That's awful.  You're just holding a silly face the whole time.  I don't know where the camera is.  Yeah, exactly.  It's kind of like a log flume, except you're plunging to your death in a fiery plane.  She's showing her tits. 
[03:05:00]  No, you're not supposed to do that.  I didn't say it was the same feeling.  Oh.  I said it's just, you know, like you said, there had to have been a front row when that plane, you know.  Like there has to be a front row on a roller coaster.  So here's the comparison.  Like a roller coaster, there were seats.  There were human beings and seats involved.  Very much like a roller coaster or an office or a movie theater.  Do you think being impaled by 50 spears is the same as a merry-go-round?  I would think it's just the same thing. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  I mean, I know.  Fast merry-go-round.  I once stood on line for an iPhone.  Ah.  So it's like, I know what it's like to crash in an airplane.  Right, exactly.  You see the front of the line and you go, they're getting their phones first.  Just like it.  It doesn't take a while, just like me falling.  Travis' explanations of everything.  Perfect.  That's good.  Yeah.  That was really good.  I almost thought you were there for a second.  Especially when you heard the plane going,  tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Anyway.  Whee!  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  The horror of that.  You don't even want to.  Of looking out that fucking gaping hole.  Imagine seeing the fucking sky and feeling the outside air.  It's just a little loud.  You're strapped into the seat.  And you're just going to go down and up and down.  And then you'll be back.  Yeah, yeah, that's just...  Isn't that scary?  The horror of being ripped out at 13,000.  I'd want a parachute.  Yeah, that would be great if you thought, like, beforehand and went like,  I put a parachute on.  Fuck is all.  I'm out.  I'm out, motherfuckers.  I'm sure that being ripped out wouldn't happen violently,  and you wouldn't rip your leg off on a fucking piece of metal. 
[03:06:30]  Exactly.  Sir, you have to put your parachute under the seat.  No, I'll be wearing it the whole time.  No, I got it on.  You fucking put it under your seat, dummy.  Yeah, you wonder if anybody was, like, getting ripped out.  Like, how long do you live the whole time, or do you pass out from the air?  Is it hard to breathe?  Yeah, because when you're that high up, isn't the air quality?  Yeah, 13,000, you could breathe.  But I was going to say, once you're falling, will the air rushing?  The people parachute from 10,000 feet, and they live?  They're fine.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  You've got to hold on to the bottom of your seat and use it as a flotation device as soon as you hit.  As they go down.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  Just get in a cannonball position.  What do you think?  A perfect dive would be better into the water, or a big belly flop from 13,000 feet?  What do you do in that time?  Because yelling and screaming, like, when they jump...  I probably get exhausted.  Ah!  Ah!  Do you stop screaming?  Yeah.  Because 9-11, it was 12 seconds.  12 seconds it took them to fall, approximately. 
[03:07:30]  That's a long, maybe 10 seconds.  That's a long time, but it's not that long.  It's fucking, you know, by the time you're done screaming, you hit the ground.  13,000 feet, you've got a lot of time to think, you know?  You're just in a plane, you're listening to the music, you're watching a movie, and then  the next thing you're just going, whoosh, falling in the air, just so like, what happened?  You know, there are people...  What just happened?  They're listening to us this morning.  Yeah.  They're taking flights.  Sorry.  And we just spent a half hour talking about what it's like to be in a plane crash.  But if it took, say, 9 seconds to fall 1,000 feet, what's 13 times 9, 130, 117 seconds 
[03:08:00]  is almost 2 minutes.  Yeah.  They fell for almost 2 minutes.  Wow.  It's horrible.  That's a long 2 minutes.  Yeah.  I bet.  Look at this parade of people.  Yeah.  What is this about?  Movie people?  It's just a big buzz that my acting is going to be showcased.  Oh, is that what it is?  Ooh, who's the blonde?  Hi there, honey.  How you doing?  Hey, look at that.  Hey. 
[03:08:30]  We're so ready to go.  Hey.  How you doing, sweetie?  Come on in.  Be a part of the movie.  I'm giving the guy the double pistol finger thing.  Double pistols.  Boop, boop, boop.  I got a pistol gun.  You could have said double guns on that one.  Double pistols.  You got to incorporate whatever's happening.  Double pistols.  Piece of fucking garbage.  Any timeline on when they're fucking there?  Anytime now.  Coming back?  Whatever.  I'm ready for the fucking movie.  You can't be in it.  You're ready?  Chris Rock, hey.  How about your name is Chris Rock and Roll?  We'll play some fucking music.  That's probably a great fucking line. 
[03:09:00]  E-Rock, are you going to be in the movie?  Oh, God.  No, Chip.  Good.  Oh, he's not.  Wow.  I don't want you in my fucking movie.  No.  It's not your movie?  No.  I'm trying to get some updates on the...  Although you would do Chip or Uncle Paul if Chris Rock were in here.  So I feel like you should try to pull off a little Chip in the film.  See if it makes it the final cut.  No, because we're going to be part of a montage.  So anytime I go, Chris is going to be like, what are you doing?  Yeah, but how great would it be if there was a what's that? 
[03:09:30]  What's that?  Just do a quick one-set, Stephen.  It would be great for us.  See if it makes it into the film.  How great would it be for my career?  Not particularly.  Because I don't like when you're shooting a feature film and you're throwing private radio jokes.  That don't help the script at all.  What if this launches Chip?  Exactly.  Stop being selfish.  Then I would think about Chip.  Chip is going to be launched.  This is the next he stinks and I don't like him, okay?  Yeah.  This is your big moment.  Yeah.  Take advantage of it.  And stop being selfish. 
[03:10:00]  What are you checking at?  I'm trying to see if in the Zimmerman case that they found those tapes relevant.  I think they did.  Are they allowing the tapes?  State to introduce 911 calls from the night of the shooting.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  I know that one.  We could probably turn on a TV.  We could do that.  The defense was going to start with, please allow that fucking tape.  Is that around the yard?  I think he's going to, another joke, maybe.  Maybe another joke.  Maybe another joke.  Yeah.  That's it.  Exactly. 
[03:10:30]  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Six million in the ashtray, but seriously, folks.  Throw a penny in and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  To hell at the expense.  Get the parakeet, another seed.  I've got to take a leak, leak.  Oh, you've got to go pee-pees?  Badly.  You want to take a break?  Yeah.  All right.  We may or may not be back.  We'll take a break and, yeah.  Oh, I've heard that before.  Yeah, we may or may not be back. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Later.  Yeah, I did.  I was good at it.  He came in my mouth.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. </pre>
