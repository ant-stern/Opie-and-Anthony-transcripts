<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with the hosts' recounting their recent day off, which was met with overwhelmingly negative listener feedback.  This led to a discussion of their Friday escape from the studio to avoid the frequent guest, Dice, whose disruptive behavior, particularly during a show with Mila Jovovich, was highlighted.  They reviewed videos showing Dice sexually harassing female guests and the ensuing online "competition" among the women for YouTube views.  The show then moved to a discussion of a Tiger Woods fart captured on camera during a golf tournament and the PGA and CBS's subsequent attempts to remove the footage. Listener reactions and humorous commentary followed.  Other topics included the indictment of Plexico Burress, the length of *Funny People*, and numerous listener calls covering diverse subjects.  The hosts also spent considerable time analyzing the attractiveness of several women, including Nicole from the Morning Mashup, Madison from Alt Nation and the Jay Thomas Show, Christina (Bobo’s girlfriend), and Gemma Atkinson, with detailed commentary on Atkinson's physique and online presence.  Listener calls continued, detailing experiences seeing Louis C.K., *Funny People*, and various strip clubs, leading to a lengthy, sexually explicit discussion of the hosts’ experiences at a Long Island strip club, followed by Danny's humorous bit, "Getting High with Ron Howard and Seth Rogan."  Numerous listener "FUs" were played throughout this section.

The show continued with a discussion of the hosts' strip club preferences, specifically their stated desire for "local, white bitches," and a debate over the "10 worst movie sequels of all time."  Films discussed included *Caddyshack 2*, *Ghostbusters 2*, *Speed 2*, *Dumb and Dumberer*, *Highlander 2*, *Blues Brothers 2000*, and *Meatballs*, with extensive criticism of *Caddyshack 2*'s casting choices and overall quality, and mention of *Smokey and the Bandit 3*.  The WWE's use of celebrity guest hosts, particularly Jeremy Piven's overt promotion of *The Goods*, was criticized, leading to speculation about the financial arrangements between the WWE and the film's studio, along with a broader discussion of the WWE's business practices and Vince McMahon's alleged control. The hosts also discussed Fedor Emelianenko's decision not to sign with the UFC and Dana White's reaction, incorporating listener calls offering their opinions on Fedor's decision and Strikeforce. The segment concluded with a tribute to the late George Taylor Morris, including a clip from Live Aid, and a brief mention of Bruce Kelly's new role with Bob Marley's The Original Wailers.

The next segment began with a potentially "flat" song, "Cry, Cry, Cry, Set the Children Free," followed by a discussion of executive producer Steve's Monday absences, including a humorous bit by C90 from England on the subject.  A significant portion was dedicated to a scathing critique of Twisted Sister's new song, "30," from their *Stay Hungry* 25th-anniversary edition. The hosts repeatedly called the song "horrendous" and "hokey," comparing it to previous Jimmy's songs and artists like Sammy Hagar and Poison, and playing excerpts to illustrate their points. They also discussed the band's appearance, criticizing the members other than Dee Snider. The conversation then shifted to various scams, focusing on inflated shipping and handling charges on infomercials like the "Awesome Auger" and Michael Jackson lithographs, along with listener calls sharing experiences with similar scams involving hotels and rental cars.  The hosts also discussed money-back guarantees rendered useless by these extra fees and products marketed towards women for sexual purposes.

The final segment included listener complaints about airline ticket and hotel pricing scams, including inflated online prices, unexpected taxes, and strict baggage fees. The hosts discussed strategies for avoiding these charges. A listener detailed Mayor Tom Menino's proposed tax increase in Boston, leading to a discussion of incremental tax increases.  The perceived scarcity and value of Michael Jackson lithographs (revealed as a scam) were discussed, along with exorbitant hotel coffee prices, and a listener's experience with the Mach 5 Razor, which resulted in sexually suggestive commentary. A listener mentioned an article about Mayor Menino wanting to raise hotel taxes, and another discussed long baggage claim waits at New York airports.  A substantial portion focused on the departure of intern "Simple Mike," with anecdotes and a "Backstage with O&A" segment mocking his departure, featuring exaggerated acting from other interns.  "Bro Chill News," a new intern bit, was played.  A listener shared a story about a funeral home lawsuit involving a body with visible autopsy wounds, and the show concluded with a commercial parody made by interns ("Randy's Ravioli"), a clip from the Seth Rogen Tabernacle Choir, and further discussion of previous topics, including a joke about one of the hosts committing suicide on air the following week, even mentioning a sponsor.

[00:11:00]  to yourself yeah so and yeah so we followed him around uh for an hour on friday and we actually  ended up playing a lot of that on uh yesterday's show during the the best that we threw that yeah  shit on the air so and the videos are up on the youtube channel op radio that's great uh we can  move on ken in california ken hey what's up guys uh i went and saw the new judd apatow film funny  people oh yes yeah we had seth rogan in we had judd apatow in really funny movie but way too long 
[00:11:30]  almost two and a half hours long and just the last the last hour of that movie is incredibly boring  wow well a lot of people a lot of people did get a hold of me and say you know the movie's a little  too long and yesterday because we had the day off i was like let's go see funny people and then we  were figuring out the time it started i think 7 30 and i'm like how many minutes is it saying the  movie is and 130 something minutes i'm like what that's like two hours and 15 minutes that's a long 
[00:12:00]  movie these days it's a really long movie epic action movie length right yeah with a comedy you  want to get in have some laughs get out you don't want anything too heavy and this movie's way too  heavy and uncomfortable the whole last hour is just really uncomfortable oh really really yeah just the  idea is this guy wants to get back with his ex-girlfriend but there's a relation there's a family 
[00:12:30]  involved it's not a fairy tale ending type of situation and it's just every you see what's  coming an hour away and you're just going through the motions really slowly and there's just all these  scenes that don't belong there with kids coloring and they're all playing together and it's just it's  really boring so you got half a good movie half a bad movie well it didn't it only did what 
[00:13:00]  twenty four million it was the number one movie for the weekend but they were hoping for a lot  more oh they were at the box office yeah oh it's hard to you know you're not going to make a huge  breakout with a rated r comedy yeah that's true and it's kind of niche a little bit i'm still going  to check it out for myself but that i am hearing it's a little too long what you do the last half  hour especially you'll just be like okay wrap it up right hmm all right well thank you ken  you guys see then you got love dice hate dice i mean we could blow off all these calls and move on so 
[00:13:30]  uh there you have it so um i know i know golf is like who gives a shit for most people but  on sunday tiger woods was getting ready to win another tournament he's on the 18th hole he's in  the fairway getting ready to you know uh hit his approach shot to the green and then there was some  kind of fart some kind of fart it was a mystery fart at first i thought somebody on the like the 
[00:14:00]  sidelines whatever you want to call it in golf in the gallery in the gallery farted and a microphone  picked it up because you see um you see tiger and his caddy kind of look off to the side and start  giggling but now they're saying that it was actually tiger woods farting and he did something  weird with his leg yeah he did this weird leg move like like he was trying to get his cheeks apart  why do we have to do that to fart like what is that i don't know it's just less resistance  oh you think yeah yeah the fart doesn't have that that much meat to travel through yeah so uh what's 
[00:14:30]  weird is the pga because it's golf and cbs they're demanding all videos of tiger woods farting be  taken down off uh off youtube and all these other video sites kind of farting at bushwood  right like what's the big deal but tmz pretty much refuses to take the uh the clip uh down  good for them do we have the clip dad sure do all right let's is it is it it's the same as this okay 
[00:15:00]  let's hear the golf announcers just ignored the fact that somebody was farting somewhere  and let it release a little bit more  tiger waits  it's interesting that uh all three of his 09 wins  that's a loud juicy one wasn't it i'm just confused that they looked off to the side like 
[00:15:30]  it came from somewhere else and they were enjoying the fact that someone farted it almost looked like  tiger was adjusting his foot or leg or something right like like it was almost falling asleep and  he's kind of yeah like hitting his shoe on the ground but you wouldn't just lift your leg up and  you know but they're like but for the pga and cbs to demand that the videos be taken down yeah yeah it's  just a good moment from a fucking fart did you notice what the the announcer said just before the fart 
[00:16:00]  what he needs a good release ah listen again let it release a little bit more at least a little  bit okay tiger waits  it's interesting that uh all three of his 09 wins i like that everyone thinks smarts are funny  of course someone laughing we came up with the formula years ago fart equals funny every single time  uh pga lights a match on tiger's fart what a stink that video made the pga tour yesterday ordered 
[00:16:30]  youtube and other websites to remove a video that purports to show  tiger woods farting on the 18th hole of a golf tournament in a clear attempt to save him from embarrassment  he used the word fart in the paper yeah is that bad no i mean it's i even think tiger's farting wind or  uh youtube on which the clip was posted sunday did as it was requested saying it took the action because of a copyright claim  by the pga tour a pga source confirmed the claim saying after consulting with cbs we did request the 
[00:17:00]  video be removed for copyright reasons copyright reasons just because that one they want to use  that in a uh future uh dvd or something what who knows hell who cares but uh it's a fart yeah and even  i mean tiger's laughing with his caddy so yeah who cares it happens yeah but that's on page three of  the paper today very important stuff page three so in other words no news no no not really yeah  there's like financial stuff all right and then i guess uh plexico is um and he's uh indicted by a 
[00:17:30]  grand jury yep which means he's going to jail that's that's mandatory you think yeah it's mandatory  new york city law that says you know you call the gun you're doing a couple of years and he and it went  off that's that's yeah yeah that's even worse they're saying what two years yeah something like  that two years because even bernie gets you know he got off the hook but they got him on the weapons 
[00:18:00]  charge right uh and he you know shot people right but wow you can't be toting you can't be toting  without a license wow what a crash in his career holy crap that sucks super bowl and now you know  jail time well he'll be in prison you know working out getting stronger come out he i don't know  what are you going to say about that i know it's a tough one he you know there's not much he's going  to be able to do with that mike in uh arkansas mike good evening hello mike i believe one of the boys 
[00:18:30]  from arkansas what's up man hey uh i just want to call attention to the fact that if you replay that  video while the commentators are talking and then uh tiger rips that part and someone immediately  coughs and tries to like cover it up oh really really what's that i mean this is going to be  everywhere today what's the big deal this is going to be like um audio forensic people trying to figure

[00:27:00]  yeah there's something to be said about the natural looking woman that's not bad right let me say hi  to nick in jersey nick uh funny thing about jim hackinson and danielle lloyd is that they are both  best known for blowing like half of the manchester united and arsenal soccer teams all right they  just blow half the team they basically uh go out one after another after another how does that become  just known that they blow half a soccer team no idea how it gets out but uh they're a bunch of hoes 
[00:27:30]  it's like how do we prove that gemma atkinson has blown half a soccer half a soccer team and why  only half one maybe two guys stop at half right why is it half how many how many players are there  on an english soccer team let's get let's do the math on this he's gone how many how many players on  a soccer team i have no on the whole team not just on the field obviously not a clue i want to see i 
[00:28:00]  want to know what number of of guys she's blown how many on one soccer team how many dicks did she  suck are you getting the answer there how many how many players on a soccer team  11 on the field all right so already that means five and a half of those guys are getting blown  five to six of those guys yeah and then how many reserves  anyone anyone anyone anyone maybe it's just the 11 you think the guys on the bench are getting 
[00:28:30]  fucking blown by half a soccer team then i go with the whole team maybe that's what it is it's like  all the guys on the field and on the bench warmers they could go fuck themselves she's blowing them  half a soccer team means half a soccer team yeah that means when like when the bus pulls up and you  start counting how many guys get off that bus get off the bus she has blown half of them so she's  blown i'm gonna guess she's blown at least 10 guys according to according to that wait 11 players in a 
[00:29:00]  soccer team about 40 in the squad all right oh wow so so she's blown about 20 guys according to  that call all right on one team by the way yeah just one team and i'm sure she's blown guys before and  since and come on you can't just say that she's blown half a soccer team how yeah how do people come  up with these outrageous fucking statements that cannot be backed up at all no like where would 
[00:29:30]  that come from and how did that guy get that information just from some other dude telling him  and some other dude told that dude come on uh let's see uh jemma atkinson has been out with three  manchester united players yeah so out of those three she's probably blew two of them and by not  just all three maybe maybe one out of three really just pissed her off or something yeah or something  was going on all right enough about jemma check it out for yourself yeah that's not bad though huh 
[00:30:00]  that's not bad though you gotta give it to her big titted monster  yeah i had uh what happened no i i had i had to drive my car in today i was all scared well you  drive your car in every day no no the uh escalate i forgot to put gas in it oh really it got no gas in  it so uh yeah and i meant to get gas yesterday wait you mean you drove the mustang in yeah oh

[00:31:00]  hey man what country do you think this is this is yeah yes i had to drive that in and it took me  with kenny um it took me it took it was faster to drive in than it was to actually park why is that  because kenny uh you know how he is which i love that he's like this because for these situations  he had to make a point of letting that guy know nothing could happen to that car it cannot be  moved now that i because i parked it myself up on the up on the first floor oh you actually went i 
[00:31:30]  into the garage itself yeah yeah yeah i went past that i'm not even in i went past the line to stop  yeah and i parked it like right there i i turned it around i i backed it in and uh put it right  against the wall where the guy said to and then kenny's just like it can't be moved no one touches  this no one drives it and like he greased the guy with some cash and just made a point he's probably 
[00:32:00]  hanging out there right now just standing right next to the car watching it right now just standing  there he's like he's like a good dog yeah he is he's like a faithful old mutt right faithful there you  go that's perfect yeah he ain't moving from your car that's our kenny oh yeah  and he um yeah so so he made sure of that and kenny got a lot of attention on um uh one of my  pictures i guess it's the picture with um was it michael emerson where uh kenny's in the background 
[00:32:30]  and uh a few comments about me and michael emerson but most of the comments about kenny about kenny  it might have been the meal jovovich one i'm not sure but ken and just bashing him it looks like  he brushed he combed his hair with a washcloth was one and look at the nose and one said kenny is  starting to look like alfred hitchcock's silhouette that was a really freaking funny line that is a very

[00:42:30]  surprised you called me uh sunday like why was he calling because you weren't sure we had uh monday  off no my email just completely fucked up i got no emails from um friday until like maybe saturday  night and you were itching to go to a club i was just like itching to do something and i didn't want  like which one was it blow the load and then have like oh we are working holy shit now i'm in trouble  uh well uh the carousel out there on uh on long island on uh good old jericho turnpike exactly 
[00:43:00]  give them a little plug but oh i don't know what's going on over there what happened well last time i  went there which was about a year ago it was uh yeah about a year ago i guess you're talking about  the russian dancers yeah yeah yeah some nice russian dancers had some nice russian dancers uh  one was you know really really nice you know and i i was giving us some money and shit it was really  very very uh mutually advantageous let's just say sure it was nice she was uh very pretty 
[00:43:30]  um great body on her fantastic so i go there um uh uh sunday and uh i don't know what happened to  that place it was like i had walked into a strip club in the south bronx it's all black strippers all  black strippers and everyone around the bar was wearing the yankee cap with the flat brim and the 
[00:44:00]  tags still on it and all black it's it's like a black strip club now i don't know if that was  just sunday that's our hometown strip club exactly they can't go black obama president nah is what  i'm thinking i don't mind a black stripper thrown into the mix but you can't have all black strippers  taxing me uh uh too much gun control um uh and now my strip club is black so you certainly didn't  stay there my strip club is black i i well you left immediately right no no because they're all 
[00:44:30]  pink on the inside oh god damn no i wanted to see what um anthony walked in and yelled otis my man  very funny kevin from connecticut um no i i stick i stuck around because i i was actually saying  yo where the white women at and uh there were a couple there was one russian you know they're all 
[00:45:00]  ukrainian or russian or wherever they're from there were two of them and one was really hot and the  other one was all right so i kind of stuck around just to see them sure and um i'm very racist with  my tipping by the way why very racist oh if it's white girls gets more oh yeah black girls they get  like uh buck the old long island buck a buck for what they come by well because they come by and  then they lean in and and they want money you know and i got the little pile of dollars and stuff 
[00:45:30]  stacked up in front of me take your your dollar with their their boobs well they try and i i hold it  out and hand it to them and and and she goes uh why don't you want to put it in there baby like put  it in in in here you know what is that supposed to do to us thank you what is that supposed to do  for us really first of all what is that supposed to do leans over with the boobs and presses them  together so you can grab the dollar right what is that wow oh what are we supposed to like like 
[00:46:00]  shoot tom yeah what is that for real supposed to do it looks ridiculous danny had a great saying  about us and what it what the difference is between like just somebody going to a tit bar  and what people that have been involved in this show going to a tit bar what it's like because i  mean what we see in this fucking studio what we've seen over the years we're lucky yeah in that way so  what it's like violent it's like going on a violent murderous rampage and then like going to a ufc 
[00:46:30]  event it's just like it's just not it's not the same thing yeah you're kind of like all right  there's some blood and stuff but i i chopped up a hooker with a chainsaw yeah you know i buried  people like i could deal with two people fighting yeah i could really deal so to have a chick like  squish your tits together so maybe what the edge of my middle finger is going to brush against the  inside of the tit i never understood that movement i i don't i i think it's stupid i mean you know if 
[00:47:00]  you want us to roll it up and you know have fun that way shove it in right then maybe then then  yeah right then maybe but maybe i'm playing along but it just looks like you don't have hands and  you need to use your boobs as hands so they come up and they stop in front of you and give the  fucking you know the tit thing and i just handed the girl the dollar and she goes oh you don't want  to put it in there and i was like i don't want to give you a paper cut that's all i can think of  last minute i was like i don't want to give you a paper cut you know tony let tony in on the 
[00:47:30]  conversation and then i have something to add to this go ahead tony hey uh oh first of all  congratulations on the hang with uh judd apatow that was a great great call on Friday but anthony  yeah it's sunday night you would normally go to work on monday right yeah i go to work on monday  oh okay go to work on monday jesus you need to make money on sunday too but who is going to make  money who's going to be there on a sunday night i see where you're going with this is this special

[00:54:30]  like haha i told you right and then on friday it became apparent that uh fedor will not be in the  ufc this guy called all morning long we saw you calling we just couldn't take the phone call you  were right we were wrong but uh dana white is fucking pissed and you rupert you were right  if the boys could find the clip of dana white going off on uh fedor it would be great to play on the  show today yeah i basically fedor is afraid of uh lesnar is that way it has to be said coming down 
[00:55:00]  to me uh what do you got dan in philly sorry for the big setup to your phone call no that's cool  totally uh first of all i'll see you guys at the usc fight um oh can i i gotta interrupt again uh  joe rogan coming in on thursday to do our radio show and he's playing the helium comedy club down  there in philly on friday where a lot of us are going to the helium on friday as well he's got two shows  and if if it's not sold out it's going to be sold out very soon so if you're in the area you might  want to pick up a ticket to see rogan he is unbelievable on that stage yeah and he's a 
[00:55:30]  great and a great ufc announcer obviously yep all right dad finally i like healing him a lot  finally what do you got as far as uh strip club goes um like here in philly dude they're all black  they're all black but you you can't go to a to a strip club in philly without seeing some like  six kid black woman with stretch marks just it's disgusting and the one place left where they have  white women dancing like gorgeous white women is delilah's and that's where all the football pros go 
[00:56:00]  so if you can't outbid them well you got no shot well dan let me tell you something we wouldn't know  about strip clubs in philly because we always went to the bathing suit places oh god yeah the swimsuit  places what the fuck is that about in philly dad and every time we went down to do a gig for ysp  they got all excited they set us up in the bathing suit place you got a vip seating and you're like  yeah yeah yeah yeah and they dance around in bikinis you know like this is fucking stupid this is 
[00:56:30]  ridiculous you go to the beach right see this shit i want to see tits and that's why we call it the  bathing suit place yeah i've never been to cheerleaders because of that fact like girls that the girls  like are really hot but they got bathing suits on yeah what the fuck and then they're like trying  to dance for you i'm like no take it off like ann said you can go to the beach and see better stuff  yeah take it off take it off yeah yeah pretty much don't bother me but yeah man like i said uh like 
[00:57:00]  the only good place left in philly is delilah's and i mean i met donovan in lab there alan iverson was  there uh i don't know if you know who michael grant is he was there and it's like these guys just  got money to burn and if you can't compete with that then you're not getting any of those sexy  women so but you're not getting them anyway sexy you never know you know what i mean i mean with  that kind of money they're taking them home you know that yeah wait you're one of these guys that 
[00:57:30]  go to the joints hoping to take one of them home oh absolutely not no no no no it does happen  but i'm saying if you've got a lot of money it's possible it can happen fairy tales can come true  it could happen to you i think if you're younger if you have a large bank roll if you tip a hundred  dollars a dance  well no that was back um probably about what like two weeks ago no no this is actually the last time 
[00:58:00]  i was there yeah you brought a girl home yeah what are you nuts why well you're passed out she's like  you know fuck that shit i don't pass out well you were just you have to pass out eventually no i  don't not till they're out my fucking house oh okay that's how that shit works you were just there  there was there was no sleepy yeah yeah last time i was there was sunday but i'm talking about the  last last time about a year ago that was that there was no sleepy time no no downtime no downtime 
[00:58:30]  no downtime all right see you're i i i figured you're smart yeah that'd be crazy to pass out and  let a russian stripper just walk around your joint no no what then when is that joe rogan show  at helium it's gonna be friday night this friday yes okay cool and tickets will go fast so call  the helium comedy club in philly it's it's a great weekend you got uh joe rogan doing comedy and then

[00:59:30]  lack of uh lack of chickness lack of chickness yeah we gotta get you a chick that's gone the strip club  black strip clubs on sunday nights it's like how do you how do you know like i don't have chickness  that that i was just you know available to go out and have fun on a sunday night and decided to go to  a strip club you know what i don't know that i made an assumption see you made an ass umption is what 
[01:00:00]  you did because you're an ass lydia out of myself you made an ass umption lydia why why do you want  anthony to have just one girl in his life yeah that's always worked so well for me i sort of have this  this feeling of like protectiveness for you guys i'm certainly not your staff psychologist  but i feel protective over your mental health and happiness but see anthony had two long-term  relationships yeah more than that if you go back a ways right two i know of sure yeah most of the time 
[01:00:30]  i've spent doing radio with anthony he was uh with a girl they get very codependent they get it's just  not a um it's not a healthy thing this whole thing with anthony dating is only uh about a year  and a half two years old at this point yeah somewhere around there i don't know the exact uh  time but and now i've fallen into just uh oh my god looking at horrid pornography on websites and

[01:12:30]  cruise control  yeah horrible  four blues brothers  2000  oh my god  could be one of the worst movies  ever  is that the one with john goodman  yeah  oof  ever made  yeah that is bad  uh batman and rob  in 1997  who was  who was batman  in that one  uh cloney  was it cloney  uh  was michael keaton  the first  i think it was  i thought that was george  how did it go  was it michael keaton  shit  who came first 
[01:13:00]  michael keaton  uh cloney was batman and rob  oh it was cloney  that's what people  so michael keaton  became uh  came before george cloney  oh yeah  keaton was like the first one  all right  and then cloney  and then i'm gonna go with val kilmer  before they said  all right enough of this  we're gonna have to rest it  for about 10 years  yeah  uh  triple x state of the union  oh it was keaton  uh kilmer and cloney  what  cloney was the last one  kilmer and cloney  yeah 
[01:13:30]  so cloney was so bad  they had to rest the whole thing  for 10 years  cloney said he almost  you know  or just about killed the franchise  yeah okay  um  state of the union  what's that  triple x  state of the union  what was that a sequel  that was a sequel  to triple x  yeah  get the fuck out  i never saw either one of those  direct the fucking shit  and number one at  has to be  has to be  caddyshack too  was there even a question  no  so there you go  the worst 
[01:14:00]  sequel ever  the worst movie ever  i put that as the worst movie  ever made  it is  ever made  the biggest waste of film  it is painful to watch  yep  with that dan ackroyd  trying to do the bill mary roll  oh  holy mother of god  and then  rodney wasn't in it  so they figured  they could just throw in  what's his face there  i'm fucking uh  the old jew  yeah the jew guy  the old jewish comedian  what the fuck is his name  i'm golfing  i'm jackie mason 
[01:14:30]  i'm jackie mason  jackie mason  oh  who's a very funny guy  well  not in that  but  did he ever make another movie  was that his only movie  i think that could have been it  as far as a big  really  they're probably like  this is gonna do  jackie  this movie is gonna do for you  what caddyshack did for rodney  did you see what that  he got all those movies after it  it's gonna be great  uh  all right  well who's in it  do we have the same cast 
[01:15:00]  do we have the  no actually  um  yeah  um  well  bill murray's not in it  yeah he doesn't believe  in the sequel  he's the guy  that was the  like  had all the lines  everyone remembers  and that  he's not in it  all right  well  oh okay  that's okay  uh  well who did they get  dan akroyd  see but he's gonna be like  the same type of goofy guy  groundskeeper  okay  what about the chevy chase  we're gonna bill  it as chevy chase is in it  but he just does a cameo 
[01:15:30]  if you blink you won't even see him  and it's obvious he wasn't close to the set  right  yeah yeah yeah  he did it from his house or something  i forgot what it was  did they call him or something  yeah it was like one of those bad things  and he was working another broad or something  what was his role in that  i can't remember  no what did he do in that  i know it had nothing to do with the actual golf course  they shoehorned him in there  just so they could have  another name from the original one  right  i'm trying to remember  i think they called him or something  or 
[01:16:00]  oh what the fuck  was it a phone call or something  oh god  that's caddyshack  caddyshack  it's caddyshack 2  yeah  ugh  randy quaid was in it  who's really funny  oh  in the vacation movies  yeah randy quaid was great  caddyshack 2  is this uh  the shack is back  oh that was in the upper deck  oh that was gone  pico  foot banners are back 
[01:16:30]  you think it's safe to hit a bull in a place like this  forward  foot signs are back  you know i'm always shooting myself  with those darn poison tip crossbow darts  caddyshack 2  i don't know why they don't put a warning on the package  come on  break it  oh my god  mackroyd was kind of on the golf course a little bit  i guess they  wow  i think they paid him for like maybe a day  to show up and do a couple things  so  oof  there you go  your worst sequel ever was uh  derrick actually wants to talk on 
[01:17:00]  oh my god  this is very unorthodox  um  d-boy  yes  d-boy  d-boy we call him  if uh my memory's right  he uh actually owned like  a share of bushwood  so they called him in to settle the bet  of who wins the golf course at the  i don't even know  really  yeah  like so they called him in at the end  yeah  or something  when they had had the uh  the tournament at the end to see who would get control of bushwood  and wasn't it miniature golf or something they were playing  or was it  well no it was like a wacky design like  fucking  oh yeah a real golf course but it was kind of a wacky 
[01:17:30]  it was like giant mini golf  like they made everything giant that you would probably see on a mini golf course  yeah  yeah  could you do your um  your impression from the prestige  oh  which one  you know  the fantagious  yeah yeah  i'm trying to  i don't even know how it goes  because he does it all the time for me  and then the fucking the one time when it might matter  because danny told me and i'm i'm laughing just so  him doing your imitation of it is great 
[01:18:00]  i don't even think he does  what did he get  oh  god damn it  all right i'm going now  he tries  that what is the life  oh he does try  so hard  you can catch me over at the  fantagious  across the street  but when he comes out he goes  oh  fantastic  like he's surprised that  Hugh Jackman is like tied up from this  oh  is this  oh  oh  i just 
[01:18:30]  i just netflicked that movie  finally  because i've never seen the prestige  that's so good  i know because of you dan  you said it's one of your best  favorite movies of all time  they climbed up the charts pretty quickly  oh yeah  oh there was another guy in uh caddyshack too  worth mentioning  sal in jersey  sal  hey uh the guy from uh unsolved mysteries  is in that movie too  i think he was the uh the guy they were trying to steal the course from  oh right yeah  i and he was in uh he was in airplane  right  uh so i guess they thought it was it would be funny  robert stack  robert stack  bob from buffalo though also 
[01:19:00]  man that is a horrible sequel  uh  bob  yes sir  hey man  why don't you say it  milky and the bandits  three  yeah  two was bad enough  three  unwatchable  who was in three again  no burt reynolds  all right  it was  it was uh  what's his face there  the truck driver there  jerry reed  oh it was his vehicle  right  and it was  he  he was dressed up 
[01:19:30]  like burt reynolds  right  and  and  driving the trans am  right  what about jackie gleason  y'all gleason was in it  yeah at this point he was just cash and checks to pay for his fucking cigarettes and his  and his cancer  and his women  chemo  booze women and  yeah yeah whatever else  cigarettes  uh and  just  horrid  i believe the plot was they were  they were taking a stuffed fish  somewhere 
[01:20:00]  like um  a fish  that had to be you know  a mounted fish  like you put on a wall  right  and they had to take that from point a to point b  or why  what was in the fish  because the  the  the  two guys that pay people to do these things  paid them  so what's the big deal  i don't know  it was so bad  god  smoky's back  and the bandit is at it again  smoky and the bandit three  and then they show like  oh my god 
[01:20:30]  they  they just show gleason on the cover  no burt reynolds  didn't they have like a 1989 camaro or something  who was it  i can't even tell you  i don't know  i don't think i ever saw three  it was so douche chilly bad  the first one had some  obviously classic lines  oh yeah  second one i don't remember as much  the first one is just awful too  because  love  how it's dated with the cb radio and stuff like that 
[01:21:00]  right  uh  breaker breaker for the bandit  all right  you know  gotta people use cbs  superman 4  godfather 3  should have been on that list  godfather 3 was pretty bad  superman 4  was that the one with um  that was the quest for peace  with uh  the guy who got his power from the uh  the sunlight  all right  yeah  quest for peace  shut it  all right  starship trooper  sequels are horrible  well those things went straight to video didn't they 
[01:21:30]  grease 2 is the worst movie ever  grease 2  why is grease 2 the worst movie ever there vic  oh grease 2  you know  caddyshack 2 at least was a little entertaining  as stupid as it was  but grease 2 with the cat they put in there  and the premise was just unwatchable  it was horrible  well what was the premise  help us out  you gotta be a little more uh  specific  the premise was  they had uh  i can't remember the guy's name  they had another guy as uh  danny 
[01:22:00]  and michelle pfeiffer  as uh  what would be sandy's character  but but wasn't it not really supposed to be them  it was supposed to be like  the next year or something  and  yeah something like that  i mean the choreography  the music  just the premise  with the  australian guy on the motorcycles  the good looking guy  and michelle pfeiffer falls for him  and uh  it was just  ugh  i love when they try to recreate  oh my god  wait a minute  yes  saturday night fever 
[01:22:30]  2  staying alive  right  wow  where he uh  tries to become  tony manero  tries to become like a broadway star  wait  i wanna  i wanna get into this choreography thing  with vick  he was really bummed  at the choreography  what's wrong  yeah  hey faggot  what happened  are you hoping they do  xanadu too  oh look at travolta  let's not go  i was  bummed on the choreography  that's a little gay  remember xanadu  xanadu  who the fuck was in xanadu  uh... olivia newton john 
[01:23:00]  and who else  uh...  i don't even tell you  go ahead vick  uh... you had a problem with the choreography  uh...  uh...  no  just the whole movie in general  it was just horrible  i mean greece is a classic movie  and they just destroyed it  by making  greece  adrian zmed  i believe was in greece too  right  that's right  yeah  that's what grant from cleveland is saying  uh... this has to be said  square head from jersey  i kind of agree with him  uh... greece one was unwatchable too  and i i'm with you square head  that is true 
[01:23:30]  is that what you like the choreography in that one  your fruit  yeah  what's the difference in the choreography between  the original and greece two  well the two step and the three step  yes  it's different between the two of them  the jazz hands  yeah  all right boys i go to work i'll punch it out  exorcist two the heretic  yeah that's pretty bad  uh... every which way but loose is the worst  major league two  major league two  do you want to remember major league two  tony what's in major league two  that was so horrendous  everything 
[01:24:00]  just  everything  but was the cast still  the same  yeah well  you know  then they came out  i think wesley struts was not in it  and then they came out with major league three  which was straight to video  and  it was just  tom berenger  who just took a nosedive in his career  okay  brutal  absolutely brutal  i got a question  i got a question for anthony  yeah  and maybe the listeners  sure certainly the listeners  yes sir yes sir  has there ever been a straight to video  movie that was actually good  wow 
[01:24:30]  because when you hear straight to video  you're like oh fuck  not  not released in the theater  for even a week  was there one straight to video movie  that for whatever reason  they just  something happened  and they had to just go that route  and turned out to be a really good movie  yeah i believe there was one that  that then  they had to put in the theaters  because it  ended up doing well  or something  yes  that's the question i got today  if someone has an answer  that we can look up  straight to video  was there actually one  that was very good  where like a majority of people  would go  oh yeah  that movie was really good 
[01:25:00]  it should have never went  straight to video  while we think of that  let me  let me bring up  um  what was that movie  where the  the divers got lost  in the ocean  oh fucking open water  open water 2  could be the dumbest  fucking premise  for a movie  i've ever seen in my life  open water sucked  open water sucked  yeah  but you know something  at least that was kind of like  oh my god  there's nothing they can do  right  open water 2  uh  there's people  they're on this yacht  and they all decide 
[01:25:30]  to go for a swim  so they all jump off the yacht  and they swim around  but they forgot to put the  the stair down  the ladder down  for the yacht  so they could get back on  sure  so they're just floating around  dying  uh  with the yacht right there  instead of figuring  some fucking way out  to get back on  you have the boat  it's right there  figure it out  there's gotta be a way  to get back on the boat  and there was not one person  left on the yacht  just one  so where was he  oh no 
[01:26:00]  there was a baby on the yacht  and then everyone else  was in the water  get the fuck out of here  and then at the end  that never happens  yeah i know  and they couldn't figure out  how to get back on the yacht  they tried  they were right next to the yacht  everything they tried  somehow injured  or killed somebody  how do you get killed  trying to  get back on a yacht  exactly  you could get killed  by the monsters  you know nibbling at you  yeah yeah  but i mean  it would take three minutes  to go all right  we have to do this  we could loop  our fucking 
[01:26:30]  you know  what were they trying to do  i think they were taking  some of their clothing off  and trying to like  loop it around  something climb up  which would work  sure  and then one guy tried to  take um  something and bash  a whole  bash a couple of  footholds  or handholds  in the side of the  fiberglass  and climb up that  and then the owner  of the yacht  who actually turned out  to not be the owner  who was trying to  impress everybody  uh got all mad  and then like  hit that guy on the head  holy shit  this sounds horrendous  it was so bad  a premise that 
[01:27:00]  it would never happen  the boat's right there  you're safe  the boat's there  and it's cause  they didn't have the ladder  cause the stairway  didn't go down  the little ladder  ugh  horrid  dumb  they couldn't get  on someone's shoulders  yeah  exactly  that's a joke  cause you know  it's water  that's never gonna work  but there would be  probably something  that somebody  can hold on to  on the bottom of the boat  like the friggin rudder  right  and then have  somebody  got it on your shoulders  and then somebody  else climb up that  there's gotta be a way 
[01:27:30]  to get back  on a fucking boat  take the air tank  pop the end  yeah  and man that'll shoot you  and now shoot yourself  they weren't even scuba diving  they were just swimming  so they didn't have that  it was  I can't tell you  how stupid this was  I'm watching this going  cause I read the premise  and I'm like  what  but they should've never  made a second one  cause Open Water  was a dud  yeah  it sucked  the premise was pretty good  but it looked like  it looked like a student film  that never mattered though  no offense to the people  making good student films  out there  but this was one of those  horrendous student films 
[01:28:00]  the look and everything  for Smokey and the Bandit 3  they tried to recreate  Burt Reynolds  towards the end  yeah yeah  Burt Reynolds  had a cameo  where Sheriff Buford T. Justice  was so crazed  with his obsession  with catching the Bandit  that he pulls over Jerry Reed  and he hallucinates  and sees Burt Reynolds  and that was Burt Reynolds  he was really in there  and he just turns around  and gives a little  ha ha ha  laugh  and walked away 
[01:28:30]  whatever  and drove away  how about Fletch 2  yeah we mentioned that  Friday the 13th  yeah  Troll 2  I guess we just  the sequels to Slapshot  were horrible  yeah  that's Ian in Canada  Ian  yeah they were  pretty bad boys  I was hung over  and I couldn't force myself  to change the channel  the third one  is so bad  that the  Hanson Brothers  sons  come back to play  and of course  the Hanson Brothers  are all  they're changed 
[01:29:00]  and they're all good  and they want to do  great things  and they  don't beat up  anybody anymore  so  how cool can the movie be  yeah that sucks  alright boys  talk to you later  thank you sir  Boondock Saints  was straight to video  was it  someone said that  I don't think so  I don't remember  that's Chad  I can't believe Chad  well why don't we  take a break  alrighty  why don't we do  a little break  we got Dana White  after the break  not live  he went off  on the Fedor thing  he really thought  he had Fedor  and it turned out 
[01:29:30]  what Fedor signed  with that other league  I don't know much  about that other league  it's all about the UFC  and my dumb world  strike force  or whatever  strike force  so basically  a lot of people  are now saying  that Fedor simply  is just scared  of Brock Lesnar  who would be  that guy  but Dana went off  and that's what we love  about him  the honesty of this guy  and we'll give you  a little clip  after the break  but first  Butcher made this  ladies presenting  ONA's guide  to a quick fix  relationship 
[01:30:00]  is your lover's  foundation crumbling  restore those  shattered feelings  with one simple  question  do you want to  put it in my ass  put it in my shitter  put it in my shitter  put it in my dirty shitter  put it in my dirty shitter  she needs it so bad  that she needs it  in the dirtiest way  possible  you don't mind it  in your filthy  shithole do you  we are just disgusting  fuck me  in my AIDS  infested  filth written  janky  fucking  stankhole shitter  what the fuck  who writes this shit  shit 
[01:30:30]  we got a lot of  little things to play  today  I know we're trying  to do less wrestling  but Sam pointed  something out  and wow  I guess they're having  like big stars  host Raw  every Monday night  yeah  but the problem is  they're um  they're  the host  is over promoting  their project 
[01:31:00]  yeah yeah  that's the whole thing  it's really really  distracting  it's the only reason  they would be doing  this in the first place  that's bad enough  yeah  and it's such an obvious  and again I'll use  shoehorning  of  them promoting  their uh  their  their goods  their wares  their projects  well Shaq  uh hosted Raw  and he did pretty well  he did great  he did pretty well  but he was  he was also  shoehorning  a plug-in  for his latest project  and uh

[01:33:30]  though  seeing Shaq  pretty much  in front of him  and Shaq  was like  bigger than him  big show  he's the world's  largest athlete  so I wouldn't  shut up  is that what  he's calling himself  now  that's what the  people are calling  him  what about his gut  he's not an athlete  yeah what about  the Korean MMA guy  that's six  what is he  he's like seven foot  or something  that animal  is he an athlete  he's an athlete  he's an athlete  big show  he's bigger  I know  Jeremy Piven  looks like  a little kid

[01:34:30]  sell hard  Jeremy  paw paw paw  paw paw  Piven  yeah  alright  is this working  for the WWE  getting all the big stars  the most  well  I mean the Shaq thing  picked up like  crazy  but it's Shaq  the Shaq thing  but it's Shaq  yeah but this is  Jeremy Piven  he's an over the top  personality  always Shaq  always  Jeremy Piven.  Yeah.  And Sergeant Slaughter next week.  The ZZ Top thing didn't pick up all that much steam. 
[01:35:00]  No, you didn't think it was.  ZZ Top was a bust.  Yeah, I mean, as far as it was, Seth Green.  Was Seth Green a bust?  Total.  We know Shaq did very well.  Shaq is definitely the MVP of guest hosts so far.  Yeah.  But let's see what Jeremy Piven does.  Well, while talking to The Miz and John Cena, The Goods comes up a couple of times.  Here's a montage.  Well, Les Miz, we are here, we're actors, and we're here promoting The Goods Live Hard, Sell Hard, okay? 
[01:35:30]  As I look at this crowd right now, I can tell that every single person in here has The Goods.  Les Miz, I'm looking deep into your eyes, my friend, and I can tell you 1,000%, you do not have the goods.  Have what?  Have what?  Have what?  Have what?  Dignity?  Like you?  Are you kidding?  You do not have The Goods. 
[01:36:00]  Years from now, when the sun is completely burned out and cars fly and cats and dogs speak English, society will remember two things.  2009, August 14th, they saw one hell of a movie.  And when Jeremy Piven came to Monday Night Raw, he delivered The Goods.  Holy shameless.  That was 12 minutes.  Oh, really?  That was only 12 minutes?  That was the first 12 minutes. 
[01:36:30]  Dude, that is...  But it's shameless.  They're completely ruining wrestling.  Yeah.  I think their goal is to just get little buzz-worthy clips.  Anything that's like...  No, there's financial transactions going on because of this.  There is a...  Did you ever...  Have you ever been in a sales meeting in radio, Sam?  Yes, I have.  Yeah, yeah.  You know when they approach you with ideas for revenue, like, this sponsor wants to do this, but they want to be more involved in the program. 
[01:37:00]  They don't just want a live read or a recorded spot.  They want the guys to be involved and make it sound like they use the product and stuff like that.  You ever hear that pitch?  I do, yes.  That's exactly what happened in wrestling.  So they came up with this idea of this guest host where they come out and promote the fuck out of their movie.  And then the movie company takes some of their advertising budget and funnels it over to Vince McMahon.  Was there a commercial for The Goods during Monday Night Raw? 
[01:37:30]  One or two, here and there.  So you're saying that the movie studio paid money and that's why Jeremy Piven did a flying body press off the top rope at the end of Raw?  No, he didn't.  He did.  But John Cena caught him.  Of course he did.  Why didn't he hit the fucking canvas?  Why didn't he land on somebody?  Really?  He caught him and then John Cena dropped him later.  Are we still talking about wrestling?  I mean, it was a good show.  No, we're not talking about wrestling anymore.  The Miz might have been kicked off Raw. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, he lost the match.  It would be so fucking great if this was like years ago, though, and you could get something like...  Well, let me tell you, I see a list of people here that are pretty fantastic wrestlers, but Schindler's List is one hell of a movie.  How many Jews out there?  I know you'll be seeing Schindler's List.  No, it doesn't quite fit, does it?  No, not bad, though. 
[01:38:30]  Like the goods.  And the goods kind of fit.  Knowing Vince McMahon, he'd have an oven match.  Oh, God damn.  To help promote.  You know he would, though, that sick fuck.  ZZ Top did have a sharp-dressed man match.  A sharp-dressed man match.  So why would that be far-fetched, that Schindler's List would have some kind of oven match?  Oh, my God.  The goods.  Oh, wow.  Jeremy Piven is shameless in that clip.  Shameless.  He delivered the goods last night, though.  Did he deliver the goods?  It's kind of embarrassing. 
[01:39:00]  Except he accidentally, he was going to say that Miz is going to get banned from SummerSlam, but he said SummerFest.  Hey, but what about DiceFest?  I want to do DiceSlam.  Dicelmania.  No.  You think Dice would do WWE?  Would do Raw?  I think so.  Somebody told me that when Dice was having a not-so-lucrative part of his career, he wanted to be a wrestling manager.  Really? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  That would have been something else, huh?  Wow, Sam, thanks.  We're going to talk about a real sport now.  Is that okay?  What, more wrestling stuff?  No, UFC stuff.  You know, if I was Dana White, I would just wait at the back door of these arenas and start signing these guys.  Yeah, I know.  Just find the next Brock Lesnar.  Can you fight like Brock?  I know you're doing the fake thing in the ring, but can you fight for real?  Because, look, the company's going down.  Everyone's leaving me.  They're going down.  The company's going down.  Dana White should just be outside with contracts for these guys to sign, the real ones that could fight. 
[01:40:00]  They're all leaving me.  The company's doing very well.  Really?  Jeremy Piven?  Yeah, Jeremy.  As a wrestling fan, does that make you excited to see these guest stars?  He's a big star.  And to see an A-lister do a flying body press?  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Brock Lesnar against the Ass Man.  Here comes the Ass Man.  Now I'm an Ass Man.  Da, da.  Yeah, he loves to kick him, he loves to suck him, he loves to tuck him, he loves to poke him.  The Ass Man making his way to the octagon. 
[01:40:30]  Would Brock be able to figure out that ass move?  I don't know.  The fame-ass-er?  The fame-ass-er.  Would he be able to figure out that ass?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  God damn.  Billy Gunn.  He could fight UFC.  Who's going to be the guest host next week?  Sergeant Slaughter.  Oh, you said that right.  But what about Ass Man?  No, Ass Man won't be there.  Well, no.  No.  What about Ass Man?  No, he still won't be there.  He still won't.  So I'm assuming Vince has just completely given up.  No, it's just sometimes they're wrestlers and sometimes they're stars. 
[01:41:00]  So if there's another, I guess, project to promote, or if another star happens to want to be the guest host, you know.  Someone is saying...  Well, let me tell you, if you want to eat some fried green tomatoes,  I think you're going to want to be at the theater next Friday when that opens up.  Because people are going to remember fried green tomatoes.  I mean, it works in a conversation. 
[01:41:30]  Does it?  Well, let me tell you something.  I don't know where we are right now.  Where are we?  Where are we?  Come on, let me...  But let me tell you something.  Listen, if we were in Madison County, you'd be seeing some bridges there.  Because that is a...  Some movies just don't fit.  What are you doing?  Why?  Why would you do this?  The goods work so well, though.  Oh, wow.  The goods are delivering the goods. 
[01:42:00]  Is it true?  The Asian guy with no penis takes a huge bump at the end of the show?  Yes.  John Cena guerrilla press slammed him over the top rope.  Wow.  It was one of those guerrilla presses where all the guys outside the ring, you fall on  them, so they kind of catch you as you're going down.  And a light Asian guy knocks them all down, right?  Well, I mean, the impact of John Cena throwing him is what it was.  Hey, yuck.  It was a good show.  Dana White, very pissed off.  Thank you, Sam.  You're welcome.  Well, let me tell you something.  This canvas down here that you're going to be on is pretty hard. 
[01:42:30]  You might want to learn how to make an American quilt and put it down on this canvas.  How to make an American quilt.  In theaters Friday.  They don't even hide it after a while.  I don't know who chose the opponent here, but it surely wasn't Sophie's choice.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  How did you fit that in?  That's great.  Yeah, everybody should go see the movie, and I just want to spell a special thank you out  there.  Two-one-foo.  Thanks for everything.  Julie Newhart.  Possible to fit in.  You know something?  Those tights you're wearing, wrestling tights, look a little ridiculous. 
[01:43:30]  You know, if you were in the sisterhood of the traveling pants, you'd be wearing something  nice.  Traveling pants.  You need to get your groove back like Stella did.  And Stella got her groove back.  I'm going to bang you into the future.  You're going to be the time traveler's wife.  Or the guy that she knocked you into the future.  Whatever.  This is a stupid promotion. 
[01:44:00]  You're going to be seeing ghosts of girlfriends past when I hit you in the head with a four-armed  smash.  How about funny people?  Funny people.  I just said it.  I have nothing.  It's a little more organic than that.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  Bam, bam.  I'm an ass man.  It's constantly queued up, which I love.  I'm an ass man.  You're an ass man. 
[01:44:30]  Yes.  Damn, where the hell's Billy Gunn been?  He's not here.  Aw.  Abu.  Is he alive?  He is.  He's working for TNA, kind of.  Is he?  Kind of.  But he can't be the ass man?  No, he's, uh.  Could he be the hiney dude?  I think he could.  I'm the hiney dude.  He can't be the ass man anymore?  No, he can't even be Billy Gunn.  So what's his name?  He doesn't have one.  Kip James?  Kip James. 
[01:45:00]  Fucking that Vince is a prick.  Can he just play this song and then pull down every time it says ass man?  No, Vince McMahon owns this song.  He owns this song?  Yeah.  But how much?  I thought he'd go, Kusama.  No, that Kusai.  That'll kill you.  But how much money does one guy need?  Why can't he just let him have his dumb name?  Because it's.  As he's wrestling in a high school somewhere in Jersey.  Here's how it should go.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  He's trying to come out to the music and it just beeps every two seconds.  He probably has a theme song that sounds like that a little bit.  Always.  Always.  It's just obviously the words are all different.  Oh, that's got to suck for those guys.  I got to get this.  They break their bodies.  And then Vince doesn't want them anymore. 
[01:46:00]  And Vince goes, oh, before you leave, give me your name.  Give me your identity.  Right.  That you've built.  Poor ass man.  Billy Gunn.  Taz can't even be Taz with two Zs anymore.  He's back to Taz with one Z.  Because Vince McMahon owns Taz with two Zs.  So Vince took a Z away from Taz?  He took the Zs away, bro.  Yes.  Does that matter, though?  Well, that sounds like Taz, you know, got away with something. 
[01:46:30]  Well, because Taz called himself Taz before.  Right.  And then Vince McMahon added a second Z.  So now he can't have the second Z anymore.  He has to go back to what he was before, just the one.  I bet you Taz will make a mistake and sign Taz with two Zs and there'll be someone there  to just beat the shit out of Taz.  If you win this match, I might be telling you a few divine secrets of the Yah-Yah sisterhood.  Jesus Christ.  I'm going to hit you so hard, you're going to be waiting to exhale, my friend. 
[01:47:00]  Waiting to exhale.  Opening Friday.  Theater is what?  Friday.  What?  Ligalong.  Mr. Kennedy got fired.  And so now he's gone.  And so now he goes to autograph signings and he's billed as Mr. Ken dot dot dot Anderson.  Vince just takes his big McMahon dick and just rapes you of all your dignity, name, everything.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:30]  That's fantastic.  Jesus.  He's got like guys who now come in, like even if they want to wrestle under their real name, they can't.  They have to have a fake real name that's not even flashy because Vince McMahon wants to own the name.  He's got to own the name no matter what it is.  Yes.  And then they could change it maybe later or something.  But can I say it again?  How much money does he need that he does this to these guys that are breaking their bodies?  I need power.  Half his wrestlers end up committing suicide.  The least he could do is give them their names when he's done with them.  He offers rehab. 
[01:48:00]  Huh?  He offers them rehab, doesn't he?  Oh, that's good.  Yes.  After, you know, these guys are doing steroids to keep their job.  I shouldn't say half commit suicide.  I mean, just half die young.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's a whole bunch of ways they're leaving this fine world.  All right, Sam.  Enough with the wrestling.  We're going to talk about a real sport now.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  The adults are going to talk now.  So take your fun little wrestling and beat us.  The adults are having a conversation.  Okay.  See you guys later.  Uh, so, uh, Fedor does not sign with UFC and that guy, I think he was from Georgia. 
[01:48:30]  You were right.  We were wrong.  What can I tell you?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  What's that?  Do you know anything about Strikeforce, Ant?  Nothing.  Uh, should we know anything about Strikeforce?  I mean, we're UFC guys.  We're...  I know Fedor fights for him.  Dana White is a stand-up guy.  He's a loyal guy.  And we're all in with Dana White and the UFC, so, you know, fuck Strikeforce.  But, uh, they signed Fedor, I guess.  I don't know why that's good.  Maybe somebody that really knows this shit could, uh, give us a call real fast. 
[01:49:00]  Um, and Dana White's going to be on Friday's show with Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  So, I think he's calling in, because, well, maybe he'll be here.  Is he coming to Philly?  I don't know.  Or is he just letting, you know, his gang...  He's probably going to call.  Yeah, he'll probably call in, and Rogan will be here.  Yeah, Rogan's here.  So, he'll certainly explain this whole thing.  But, I don't understand, you know, Fedor, you know, fighting Brock Lesnar.  That's just, that's just massive.  That's what people want to see.  That would be massive for his career.  Yep. 
[01:49:30]  Uh, this guy knows a little bit about Strikeforce.  Don't, don't bore us to death.  Just give us, like, the, just give us, like, bullet points, uh, Sean.  All right.  I'm actually the person who's calling your voice, by the way.  Wait, you were the one that said that, um...  That Fedor would never start with the UFC, yeah.  Hmm.  Well.  Ah!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  He should have never fessed up to it.  Oh, you douche!  You know why?  Because the guy, he's been calling non-stop just to rub it in our face.  To gloat.  Because he was the only one, and we kind of gave him a beating, like, shut up. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, shut up.  Of course he's going to sign.  It's a smart move.  It's where the money is.  Everyone wants to see him fight Lesnar.  Oh, he's not signing?  Oh, the guy was right?  Well, fuck him.  All right, he can call back.  We have our pride.  He can talk about Strikeforce for a moment.  Dan White goes off on Fedor.  For any of the media to seriously call this guy the best in the world, let alone pound for pound,  is f***ing sanity when he doesn't want to, he won't give you the fights the fans want to see.  I have tried to do everything in my power to make this fight happen, you know? 
[01:50:30]  All the things that they said before, and I didn't wake up feeling, you know, feeling good like we can, I f***ing knew.  I knew we were going to make that deal.  The ass man knew?  There is no sticking point.  I'm over it.  I'm over the deal.  I'm over the deal.  I, to be honest with you, I don't even want to talk about him anymore.  I don't want to talk about him.  I, I, I literally did every, do you really give a s*** that much about him?  That this guy won't even step up and give you what you want to see?  And he got offered a f***ing ass load of money. 
[01:51:00]  A ton of money, everything that he wanted.  He could go fight and sambo every f***ing Thursday night if he wants to.  He could do everything he wanted to do.  You know?  And we showed them nothing but respect and tried to bring them in because the fans want to see this fight  and the media keeps talking like this guy is the f***ing best.  You know what I mean?  I, I put my money where my mouth was, laid everything out and tried to make this thing happen  and they're, they're, they're coming up with unrealistic s***.  This guy doesn't want to fight the best in the world.  I don't even want to talk about him. 
[01:51:30]  I want to talk about the guys who do want to fight the best in the world.  Period.  A guy that doesn't want to, f*** him.  I don't want to talk about it anymore.  If he wants to call and make a deal, I'm in.  I'm ready.  That's why it's Dana White's, it's his sport.  I know, I know.  The passion this guy has.  Holy s***, is that great?  He's a colorful man.  Absolutely.  Peppering in some colorful language into that interview.  Sean has called back, but there's a couple of good instant feedbacks.  I'm going backwards a little bit.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  I know your every move, brother. 
[01:52:00]  I've got them all down in the notebook.  A henchman from Brooklyn, he's good for a few every day.  When you fight me tonight, it's going to be your downfall.  Opening in theaters this weekend.  All right, let's, you know, Sean, what can I tell you?  You were right, we were wrong.  Oh, well, I wish I was wrong, but Strikeforce, they've been around for a while.  They're a mainly California organization.  They've got some good guys, but nowhere near USC guy level. 
[01:52:30]  All right, so why would Fedor do that, then?  Yeah.  What I tried to tell you all, the co-promotion thing that they want and they require for anybody  that they'll sign with, and Strikeforce is willing to co-promote because they want the Fedor name,  but Dana White doesn't need him, so he won't co-promote.  They want 50% of everything.  Dana White has a way of developing superstars in the sport.  Because remember when Liddell and a few of these guys were retiring, you're almost like, 
[01:53:00]  uh-oh, who's coming up?  Look up the deal that was leaked, that was offered Fedor.  It was like $5 million a fight.  He gets, he can wear any M1-related stuff to the ring.  They'll have M1 advertisements on the ring canvas.  M1 gets a percentage of the pay-per-view revenue from when he fights Lesnar for the title.  He gets an immediate title shot.  He turned all that down for what's being reported at half a million, 
[01:53:30]  or a million dollars per fight with co-promotion at Strikeforce.  So, that's ridiculous.  Is Fedor getting a better deal from Strikeforce?  I'm a little confused.  In the end, because of the Showtime deal that Strikeforce has,  M1 may get a little more money and Fedor is a partial voter of M1 also.  But you guys, but these guys are animals.  You've got to think they really want to fight the best.  He's going to be so unsatisfied not fighting Brock Lesnar or whoever else comes up  that's the best in the world. 
[01:54:00]  I'm not saying Brock Lesnar is the best in the world,  because that's, you know, you can obviously argue that,  but that would be a fight everybody would tune in to see.  One of the things that's always been in Fedor's contracts recently  is he gets to select who he fights.  He doesn't want the matchmakers selecting his fights for him.  Right.  That's how it's been whenever, at the end of Pride, that's how it was.  And that's just how it's been.  I don't know.  I see this as another organization that's probably going to go down the shitter  because UFC's got everybody watching. 
[01:54:30]  And I don't even know what the fuck Strikeforce is.  I don't know who's in it.  I don't know.  Well, like how popular could it fucking be?  It'll bring some people to Strikeforce because Fedor is a big name.  But, I mean, there'll be a little, you know, interest there.  Well, Scott Coker runs Strikeforce pretty good.  He doesn't try to compete with the UFC.  He doesn't try to be on that level with them because he's seen what everybody else has done.  And he just brought it up from a smaller organization to bigger. 
[01:55:00]  He actually runs it right, and they probably won't be around for a while.  Strikeforce, do they fight in a ring?  No, they have a round, instead of a cage, they have a, it's a round ring thing.  It's a round ring?  What is it?  It's round Tupperware?  What is it?  Yeah, round spring.  Yeah, it's a cage, but it's, I was glad it makes up a little league.  But, yeah, it's a cage.  Okay.  Yeah, because seeing, like, any fight with ropes looks so dated now.  Yeah, I want to see a cage.  Because we're looking at a clip of Fedor in a boxing ring. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And it just looks so weird to see him fighting.  The illegal elbow he got hit with in the fucking eye.  Oh, my God.  His eye looks like it's popped out.  The blood is running out.  You think he's going to be pissed off after getting that to the eye?  I think they called the fight, that one.  Oh, really?  Oh, that was the one?  Okay, right, right, right, right.  All right, punch out.  Thank you, Sean.  It was an elbow that hit him.  Wow, that's fucked up right there.  Showtime owns Strikeforce, so he'll get more publicity. 
[01:56:00]  Eric in Jersey.  Yeah, that's the deal.  I mean, Fedor was offered a hell of a lot more money going to, you know, the UFC.  It was actually $3 million for his first fight.  And with the pay-per-view bonus, it would have been $6 million.  But Strikeforce is nationally seen on Showtime.  And since Showtime doesn't have the pay-per-views, anybody that subscribes to Showtime gets the fight.  So Fedor will be seen by a lot more people.  But he definitely punked out. 
[01:56:30]  He's a bitch.  Fuck him.  All right, there you go.  And that's basically what Dana White's saying.  He's a bitch?  Fuck him.  Oh, and I forgot.  Good evening.  Good evening.  We'll get Dana White on the show Friday to talk more.  I think he's in Dubai or something.  That's why he can't really call.  Oh, yeah?  Because, yeah, cell service.  We don't get phone calls from there or anything.  From Dubai?  I don't know where the hell he is.  Hey, just on a side note, we lost a great broadcaster.  George Taylor Morris passed. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, no.  Didn't he do a little interview with us?  When we finally came back after our over two-year hiatus, the first thing we did was sat down with George Taylor Morris.  That's right.  That guy is now dead from throat cancer at the age of 62 years old.  Did he smoke?  He had to have.  He had those pipes.  It was nice.  He did a lot of the artist's confidentials for XM.  Yeah.  You know what he's known for, though?  As a side player in one of our favorite clips we've ever played on the show. 
[01:57:30]  No way.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  And that was George Taylor Morris being the real man in that situation.  And he probably already had throat cancer, by the way.  He probably had the big C.  And meanwhile, fucking...  A twinkle toes is crying because you saw the who.  He's being a baby.  Do we have that, Travis?  I'm absolutely crying over here.  This was at the...  What concert was that?  Fucking Live Aid.  Live Aid over there.  The last one they did.  Across the pond. 
[01:58:00]  And George Taylor Morris, when we went down XM from time to time, was just a stand-up dude.  He was a great guy.  Yeah.  He was a big fan of what we did, even though he did very different radio.  Yeah.  You know, he was all about the voice and the knowledge of, you know, the music he was playing.  The music man.  He came from that side of this business.  Yeah.  And just a solid dude.  I didn't even know he was sick.  I thought he was doing okay.  Last time I saw him, he had a big scar down the side of his neck where they went in. 
[01:58:30]  And he was working again.  Wow.  I had no idea that it came back and eventually, you know, obviously took him.  So, do we have that clip, though?  I've got to hear this.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under these phone talks.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player. 
[01:59:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, that video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah, that was...  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  But it was just very...  I mean, you know, it's just the who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the who.  And that's it.  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage.  Black and white was happening on the big screen, too.  So there's two more to go here at Hyde Park.  And the crowd...  I'm like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this...  You know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  DJ's crying?  Is that what this moment was really all about?  I'm absolutely crying here.  And you can tell George Taylor Morris is like...  Suck it up. 
[02:00:00]  Are you kidding me?  Suck it up.  I had the big casino ripped out of my throat.  You know what I'm dealing with right now?  And you're crying over seeing the dumb hoe?  And that chick.  That was so funny.  Through your tears.  You faggot.  That's the weakest link's daughter.  Yeah.  Yes.  You are the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Bruce Kelly.  Good old Bruce Kelly.  Bruce Kelly.  What's he doing these days?  I don't know.  What does Wikipedia say?  Yeah.  What does Wikipedia say?  The last update that's here.  It says,  In October 2008,  Kelly announced his next position 
[02:00:30]  as co-manager of Bob Marley's  The Original Wailers,  the backup musicians for the reggae legends career.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, what?  Co-manager.  When you said co-manager,  I was waiting for restaurant name here.  Co-manager Bennington's.  Co-manager.  Co-manager of Bob Marley's  The Original Wailers.  All right.  The backup musician for the reggae legends career.  Okay, so it's,  these are all the backup guys 
[02:01:00]  that played with Bob Marley,  and he's the co-manager  of those guys.  Of those guys, right.  All right, well.  All right, we wish him nothing the best.  I'm seeing the Wailers play.  I'm absolutely crying that this is my job.  But how great is it that he is  the co-manager of the Wailers?  Co-manager of the Wailers.  Because he was wailing.  Yeah, all right.  I was embarrassed. 
[02:01:30]  I'm absolutely crying here.  So, George Taylor Morris will be missed.  It's a bummer.  He was one of the good guys at XM.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  There were a lot of cunts down there,  but he was one of the better ones.  One less person, serious as the fire.  Yeah.  I don't even know if he...  He was on Deep Tracks.  Was he?  He did a lot of the Deep Tracks thing.  Oh.  Speaking of...  I don't know.  Do you want to hear a song?  Do I want to hear a song?  Well...  Can I go to break?  Yeah, well, there's a... 
[02:02:00]  Maybe?  I heard Bob Marley and Ziggy Marley's got a song out with Jack Johnson.  And it sounds really old school.  Really?  I'd rather hear Twisted Sisters 30.  You want to hear that after the break?  I so want to hear that.  Because it's such a douche chill.  How about we negotiate here?  We're back and better than ever song.  I want to...  Can I play Cry, Cry, Cry there, Travis, a little piece?  I want to...  Cry, Cry, Cry. 
[02:02:30]  I want to see if Anthony likes this song.  I had no idea it was Ziggy Marley and Jack Johnson.  I was shocked to find that out.  Is it?  Now, this might be an obvious question.  Is it reggae?  No.  It sounds like a song that could have been recorded in the 60s.  That's what I like about it.  Yeah, turn this up.  We're going to play this.  We'll be back with the new Twisted Sisters song.  Yes.  And other ditties.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry. 
[02:03:00]  Set the children free.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  Mama loves to work.  Daddy loves to play.  Sometimes daddy gotta go far away.  I'm too young to go quiet in the night.  Try to pull me to sleep. 
[02:03:30]  I'm going to give it a fight.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  Wake you up at 5 a.m.  Before the sunrise.  Before the sunrise, I'll be your friend. 
[02:04:00]  And you know I don't like for you to take too long.  Just come rolling when you hear this song.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  Well, I'm going to miss you now, Mr. Far Away. 
[02:04:30]  Paint a picture of you and send it off today.  And when you come home, you can bring it back to me.  Color in the lines define this whole world for me.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free. 
[02:05:00]  Practice makes perfect, and that I agree.  Don't be surprised that I want to be free.  I know what I know, and that's all that I know.  But I've been told you reap what you sow.  So I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free. 
[02:05:30]  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  Mama's telling me what to eat today.  But I don't feel like I'm going to go that way.  What I need is something sweet and nice.  What I need is a treat, all right.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry. 
[02:06:00]  Set the children free.  I'm going to cry, cry, cry.  Set the children free.  Set the children free.  Set the children free.  Set the children free.  Free up their hearts, free up their minds  Set the children free 
[02:06:30]  Free up their dreams and their imaginations  Set the children free  Set the children free  Set the children free 
[02:07:00]  You know that by now  Thanks for checking us out 
[02:07:30]  So Twisted Sister, huh?  Can I play a quickie before the Twisted Sister?  Sure  We went through this whole thing with Steve  The executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show  Decided out of nowhere to take every Monday off  Yeah  Wow  And we happened to take a Monday off yesterday  Yeah we did  Once in a blue moon as they say  Once in a blue moon  So we're pretty much past the Steve taking every Monday off for the next year  Yeah  Bang 
[02:08:00]  He tried to squeak that by  There was a big on-air controversy about semantics  What he meant to say  Right  What he did say  What one email said as opposed to another email  It was just a big clusterfuck  Well we got a bit from C90  He's from England  And he went with the whole Steve taking Mondays off  And this is quick and worth playing today  Check this out  All bears need to hibernate 
[02:08:30]  So I'm gonna turn off my phone  I'm not gonna go to work today  I'm just gonna stay at home  And Opie doesn't understand  He always said I'm as good as gold  And I can see  No reasons 
[02:09:00]  There are no reasons  Even for the good of the show  Oh  Tell me why  I don't work Mondays  Tell me why  I don't work Mondays  Tell me why  I don't work Mondays  I wanna sleep  The whole day long  A little quickie for ya 
[02:09:30]  C90 from England  Came up with that  Good job C90  I mean it's no Twisted Sister  No  Apparently Twisted  Wow  Right back into the fray  Into the rock and roll fray  Opie  With a song called 30  And we like D  D's done our show a few times  Yeah  And you know  We don't mind the guy  But  And he's a very talented guy  But  But wow  Yeah  It's a new song  From Twisted Sister 
[02:10:00]  Called 30  Lyrics are reminiscent  Of Jimmy's  They're back  They're back  It is  Pure hokiness  This  From what I've heard  Pure hokiness  This song is horrendous  Where  Where I think  The theme of this whole thing is  You know  They  They  When they  When they turned 30  They thought  You know  That was it  Over the hill  And stuff  Now that they're  Way past 30  They're realizing  You know  You could still rock 
[02:10:30]  Dude  But  But that's an old concept  No shit  You know when that  Was relevant  When Mick Jagger turned 30  Like holy shit  Wow  You're still rocking  Now that you got  The Stones still on tour  And they're in their 60s  This  This  This is  Not relevant  To anything  No  And the way they went about it  Pretty much every rocker  Is over 30 at this point  Yeah  A majority of them are  Yeah  But the way they 
[02:11:00]  They go about it  It's like  Metallica  Awful  Those guys are what  Mid 40s at this point  Danny  Gotta be  Alright so they're in their  Mid 40s  So Dee Schneider  And Twisted Sister  They're gonna come out  With a song called  30 and it's supposed  To be relevant  30  Metallica is rocking hard  And they're on their way  To 50  I think  What they're saying  Is that  They're not 30  They're so far  Over 30  And they thought  30 was like  You know  Gonna be the wall  Plus shouldn't he  Have written this song  About 15 years ago 
[02:11:30]  Yes  How old is Dee Schneider  He's gotta be  Pushing 50  Yeah  Exactly  So why is he  Why does he have a song  Out called 30  Shouldn't it be called 50  And then maybe  It all makes sense  I don't really know  Does anyone know  You gotta listen  To the lyrics  Dee's 54  So he's 54  And he's singing  About being 30  You gotta listen  To the lyrics  Man  Alright  Well it's released  As a bonus track  On the 25th  Anniversary edition  Of Stay Hungry  Why do you need 
[02:12:00]  A 25th  Anniversary edition  Of Stay Hungry  The one you got  Is that it's still  Good enough  What's wrong  With the one you got  What could possibly  Make it more important  Doesn't have 30 on it  I don't get that  When it comes to  Movies as well  25th  You know  Anniversary edition  Of Star Wars  Or whatever  They usually throw  Something in there  A little something  Like Sling Blade  You wanna hear  A little piece of  Is that released today  What  It's already shipped  It's on  Blu-ray  Sling Blade 
[02:12:30]  Sling Blade on Blu-ray  Is out today  Everybody  Why do you need it on Blu-ray  To see Carl  In HD Glory  And there's gonna be  There's little extras  But you don't really need  To see that movie  In Blu-ray  Oh yeah  Well it's not  I mean  You know  It's not like  Action packed  With effects  And everything  But you know  I mean if I have  A Blu-ray player  And I'm gonna  Purchase a DVD  I might as well  Get the current format  I do have to acknowledge  The Cry Cry Cry song  Might have felt flat  Are you catching  A lot of shit  It might have felt  A little flat 
[02:13:00]  I could give a shit  About freeing the children  And Cry Cry Crying  It just  It just  Sounded like a song  From another era  That's all  Yeah  An era gone by  What is that  Spill the wine  Like that type of  You know  It's just a chill  Groovy  You're just grooving  Smoking your dope  Yeah man  Yeah maybe we were all stoned  Wait you're surprised  That the man  Who has giant hair  Wears makeup  And made a record  Called Stay Hungry  Wrote a corny song  Yeah 
[02:13:30]  It's just that  It is reminiscent  Of Jimmy's  The whole concept  Is pretty much  We're back  And better than ever  We're back  Together forever  Scott M. from Hobpog  God look at the largest forehead  Scott M. from Hobpog  Writes  Even when they had long hair  Though he had that forehead  Yeah yeah  The album was Stay Hungry  Maybe the song title  Is actually Thirsty  Want to hear a little of this  Do I ever  Tell me when it gets bad 
[02:14:00]  It got bad right there  That's like dated guitar right  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Well  We never had the time  To plan our lives past 30  Alright  Sing  Can we get the lyrics to this one?  We never had the time  To plan our lives past 30  So now here's what it is  It's not 30 
[02:14:30]  It's  They're past 30  Way past  But they never thought about  Planning anything past 30  Because once they hit 30  You always assume  Once you hit 30  It's over  But they realized  Dude  They're still rocking  Even though they're  Way past 30  Like 30 was that wall  But are they really rocking?  No  Not at all  This is  They're schlocking  This is horrible  I had the time  To plan our lives past 30  We were bulletproof 
[02:15:00]  Through the roof  Nothing good ever hurt it  30 heard it  Wow  30 heard it  You sure this isn't a morning zoo  Song party?  I know  There's some shoehorning  They're shoehorning  They're trying to rhyme 30  30 with heard it  With heard it  I thought he was going to say heard it  I swear I thought he was going to say heard it  I thought he was going to say heard it  But we loved it  Never gave a damn 
[02:15:30]  About the other side of the hill  I can't drive  55  Never gave a damn  About the other side of the hill  Because when you hit 30  They say you're over the hill  Right  So alright  Never gave a damn  About the other side of the hill  But 30 is the new 20  Or whatever the fuck they say  So this is an old concept  He doesn't know  This is a very old concept  No it's not about 30 man  Never gave a damn  About the other side 
[02:16:00]  Let's play a game  I love games  Raise your hand  For why  When you hear another song  Within this song  Okay  Because we got the Sammy Hagar  I can't drive 55  Yeah yeah  And you can play along at home  Probably on one of the  You know  Little chat things  Little chat things  Would be the easiest way I guess  Alright so far we got  I can't drive 55  From Sammy Hagar  Never gave a damn  About the other side of the hill  Oh  Nothing could stop us 
[02:16:30]  Nothing ever will  Oh my god  How about another take  Oh  That's so bad  He forgot the lyrics  How about another take  Nothing ever will man  Did you hear that?  Nothing's gonna stop us  He ran out of steam  Singing that line  This is horrible  I hear a little poison in there  I wish there was a little poison in there  I want some specific songs though  Never will  And when we hit the stage 
[02:17:00]  Like you never know  That it came and went  A long time ago  We rocked the 80's  Like we thought it would never end  Oh this is  We're back and better than ever  This is  This is  We're back and better than ever  We're back together forever  Why isn't Jimmy here today?  I know 
[02:17:30]  It's the same song  We're back together  Yeah  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time  I've been through changes  We've played some games  The more things change  The more things stay the same  We're a little bit older 
[02:18:00]  But we're much lighter  We're back  We're better than ever  We're back  We're back  Together forever  We're back  We're back  We're better than ever  We're back  It's back  We're back  Together forever  Yeah  That's a little  Jimmy's  We're back  Yeah  And the similarity  Is amazing 
[02:18:30]  We can still bring the house  Down like we did  We're back  We're back  And yet  No, no, no, no, no  No, no, no, no, no, no  No, you can't  No?  Maybe a smaller room  A much smaller room  Yeah, yeah  Yeah  You know  We're back  We can curse  We can fight  We can go all night  Still tearing up even more  But it came and went a long, long time ago 
[02:19:00]  Long, long, long, long time  Wow, it's like D took Jimmy's song and kind of twisted it around a little bit  Well, he is Twisted Sister, so come on  They're also saying Motley Crue, Girls, Girls, Girls, Skip the Trucker  Yeah, there's a little Girls, Girls, Girls  And so I'm going to say they ripped off the guitar riff from Helmut's song, Unsung  Really?  That's an AF song, Ed, huh?  Oh, wow, yeah  Helmut, Unsung?  Helmut  Go  We were 25, so alive, nothing must no road on our minds 
[02:19:30]  It was a rocked out, knocked out, sold out, show every time  Know that  Know what? I don't even understand what you just sang there  It's just a rock  There was some mumbling in there  They're 25, they're playing, they're rocking, dude  Rocking, not paying attention at 30, he's getting closer  Who cares, who cares, it's over the hill  Man, we're not even thinking about that  We're just, we're just living 25  Yeah  Then what happens? 
[02:20:00]  It was a rocked out, knocked out, sold out, show every time  Know that  Know that  Is he talking about vaginas?  I don't know  We were rocking it, heading for the promised land  Which I think is a girl's vagina  You know where that, because he goes, you know where that is  Like, where is that? 
[02:20:30]  It's her pussy  Yeah  It's her pussy  It's her snatch  It's her snatch  It's her little, her little snatch  It's her love pocket  25, still alive, rocking  It's her smelly taco  This is so bad  It's, it is Jimmy's song that he goofs up  Yeah, yeah  This is like  I can't wait to play this for Jimmy  It's got that same feel to it  The lyrics are bad  The music's atrocious  Sister Payne from Vince Neil's soul album 
[02:21:00]  Who is the fat fuck  Trying to squeeze  Like, D's got the hair and the makeup on  Like, he's still trying to, you know  Pull that off  Well, D's trying to keep himself in shape  And then  The other guy looks like Bob Buckman in drag  Yeah  Who's the guy all the way to the left, though  That is just not fitting in his spandex  Like he used to  Wow  Not surprisingly  Steve knows who he is  It's the bass player, Mark Mendoza  It's Mark Mendoza 
[02:21:30]  It's Mark Bulldozer  And that dude looks like Paul Stanley  That like  Oh yeah, a little Paul Stanley over there  Wow  Jesus  See, D was so recognizable  That he could go back into that makeup  And people were like  Alright, yeah  He's doing the twisted sister thing  The rest of the guys look just horrendous  They look like trannies  There's a little more  Well, D looks a lot like a tranny there  Yeah, but you know the look, though  So you can  You know what I mean?  He can pull it off  And there's a lot of age under that makeup 
[02:22:00]  I see the two guys  I see the two guys on the right  Said, fuck you  I'm not wearing the makeup anymore  I'm pushing 50  So they went with the sunglasses  And the mullet  The other two guys  Had the eye shadow on  Back to the song  Oh, please  They lost track  Let's go to the phones, Dan 
[02:22:30]  Let's say hi to Josh in Tampa  Josh, what do you have for the show?  They're also ripping off  Rock and Roll Band by Boston  Horrendously  Like a little story song  About the band  And what it was like  Oh, okay  Yeah, the concept of it  Right, right  Other than out of Boston  Yeah  Going to the stage  All that crap  God, this is horrendous  Oh, there you go  Thank you, sir  Chris in D.C.  On Skinny Bop  By Poison's definitely in this song  Yeah, you can hear a little of that  So I guess this was done for what?  That country show?  Because Doug B. at work 
[02:23:00]  Says at the end of the show  When D. finally performed it  In front of a country crowd  He said  We could curse  We could fight  We could fuck all night  And the country crowd was horrified  Why would they play this  In front of a country crowd?  I think it was some kind of like reality show  Oh  And he wrote this song  I think for the show maybe  Oh  I didn't see the show  But that's what I'm getting  From the fine folks out there  Long, long, long 
[02:23:30]  Long, long time  I cannot wait to see Jimmy's embarrassed face 
[02:24:00]  He's going to be sitting there  With his hand  With his head in his hands  Just shaking his head  Like I can't  I can't  Oh, definitely  The douche chillery  Bob in Florida  The thing that comes to my mind  I can't believe  How much it sounds like  The douchebag song by Sammy Hagar  There's only one way to rock  Yeah, there you go  That's in there  I love you guys  Punching out, man  Thank you, sir  Let me go to Mary  Mary  Hey, what's up, folks? 
[02:24:30]  If you listen  Right before you started the game  They started a song like  We're going to be together forever  Stuff like that  I just pictured the lyrics  From Laverne and Shirley  And them kind of sitting there  With their chins on their hands  Aging about the old days  Punching out  Let me say hi to Rick  Rich, Rich in Baltimore  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy  Hey, when Jimmy went long for him  On the song  When he started doing  Like, we used to go to Panama  We used to jump  And then we'd dance 
[02:25:00]  In the streets  And he was like  Oh, wait, that didn't rhyme  It sounds exactly like  When he says  You know where that is  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, like he threw that shit in  It's the same song  Jimmy is a genius  It's scary  Yeah  He just  All right, guys  Thank you, Rich  Someone says they'd rather hear  Doyle Hargrave's band  Happy birthday to Billy Bob Fortin  54 years young today  Wow  Come on, Randy 
[02:25:30]  You got to play through it  There ain't no fucking band, Randy 
[02:26:00]  You're tuning son of a bitch  Randy  John Field from Wilmington  Jim Norton should sue the shit  Out of Dee Snider  For copyright infringement  I'll play with that, baby  Jimmy's goop song  And he gets money out of it  I'll play with that  Time ago  Daddy came and went  A long, long time ago  A guitar 
[02:26:30]  Ah, not a guitar  A plingitory lead  This is so awful. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Damn.  All right.  Holy shit.  It's got to have a big pandemonium ending.  But they did. 
[02:27:30]  We can still bring the house down like we did with that went.  Oh, we can curse, we can fight, we can go all night.  Still tearing up even though.  30 came and went a long, long time ago.  We can curse, we can fight, we can go all night.  With a hell of a pharmaceutical.  30 came and went a long, long time ago. 
[02:28:00]  30 came and went a long, long time ago.  No, no, wait.  You missed the big douche chill at the end.  Shit.  You really won't?  Yeah, there's one big douche chill at the end.  For real?  Yeah.  That's what people are saying.  Okay, hold on.  Yeah.  Almost there.  Hold on a minute.  The final fucking douche chill.  Really?  I thought we were done.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:28:30]  Let me see.  Where we went.  Okay, hold on.  Sorry about this.  30 came and went a long, long time ago.  I said 30 came and went a long, long time ago.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And 60's up ahead. 
[02:29:00]  Yes, it is.  Oh.  And 60's up ahead.  Yes, it is.  Whew.  Whew.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  Boo.  Boo.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir. 
[02:29:30]  Bad case of loving you is coming in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Dan in Minnesota.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was going to mention the middle of that guitar solo, the second half of it, which was just  horrid, by the way.  It resembles the Meow Mix jingle from the 80s.  Meow Mix jingle.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Can we get that?  Which is also a C.C. DeVille lick from the Talk Dirty to Me solo. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  It's pretty brutal.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  How annoying was this commercial?  New Meow Mix from Fiorina.  The cat food with three separate flavors in one package.  Three flavors that cats love best.  Tuna, liver, and chicken. 
[02:30:30]  Meow Mix tastes so good, cats ask for it by name.  Wipe it on your vagina.  Angry cat.  Angry cat roll.  Angry cat is great.  Angry cat.  You tell me that's not an alien.  Get the fuck out of here.  Burger.  I love angry cats.  Scary.  I like tuna.  Yeah.  I kind of like liver in small doses. 
[02:31:00]  And I certainly love chicken.  You put some of that shit in front of me.  There's no fucking way it tastes like any of those things.  I like chicken.  I like liver.  Meow mix.  Meow mix.  Please deliver.  Well, we're going to play that song for Jimmy when he's back.  When is Jimmy coming back?  Thursday?  Is that it?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What is this?  Din, din.  I want chicken.  I want liver.  Meow mix. 
[02:31:30]  Meow mix.  Please deliver.  I've got you now, Dr. Evil.  That's great.  Fucking stupid-ass movie.  That's why Danny's the king of the internet.  Jesus.  That was a quick find.  That's great.  So Jimmy comes back Thursday.  We'll play that song for him?  Yeah, yeah.  Because the similarities are amazing.  And Jimmy's been calling in from the movie set up there in Boston.  Oh, is that messages?  We got a new message from Jimmy.  Hey, Mom said we're in a house waiting to shoot. 
[02:32:00]  We have to learn this dance for the end of the movie.  It's like, you know, just like animals and shit dancing.  So we have to learn the dance.  So I'm in a room dancing with Patrice and two of the other guys.  And we're all just awful.  It's fucking hard.  It's like ace that end one, end two, end go, end three.  Oh, it's fucking brutal.  And then we're dancing and Brooke Shields comes in.  So I'm dancing next to Brooke Shields.  And it's just humiliating.  Because she's good. 
[02:32:30]  I stink.  Just can't let the dance moves.  We're supposed to be a better dancer.  And you try to be ironic at first.  Like, yeah, I'm a terrible dancer.  Then you realize other people are catching on.  And you're going to be filmed dancing.  And you're going to be dancing.  Oh, fuck.  I got to see this movie.  Just to see Jimmy dancing.  Come on.  This thing won't be out for, fuck, probably a year.  Close to a year, right?  Damn.  Steven S. from Bayshore, Anthony.  Angry Cat.  Here's a little callback for you. 
[02:33:00]  Angry Cat is Jack Jack.  After he was told he would no longer live in the splendor that is Chateau Cumia.  Yes.  Poor little feller.  God damn.  He has to dance?  Huh?  He has to dance with, like, fake animals?  I guess, yeah.  Yep.  Let's say hi to Droopy in Virginia.  Droopy.  Yes.  What the fuck's up with the phones?  Why aren't they clicking today?  All right.  Good evening. 
[02:33:30]  Hi, Droopy.  Good evening.  Yeah, my wife dragged me to one of these Monsters of Hair Metal pavilion shows where there's, like, 30 of these awful bands.  And Twisted Sister was closing.  And I realized about 20 minutes in to an hour and a half set, I really don't know more than two Twisted Sisters.  Yeah, you really don't know.  Well, you know, there's, uh...  There's We're Not Gonna Take It.  There's We're Not Gonna Take It.  And then there was the, uh...  I Wanna Rock.  I Wanna Rock.  A lot of shit in the middle. 
[02:34:00]  I like Twisted Sister.  They're all right.  What were some of the other bands at this outdoor pavilion?  Well, it was fucking L.A. gun.  Um, it was slaughter, extreme.  It was awful.  It was one of those deals where you had to go because your chick wanted to go and you're just like, please, please, can I just, can we go now?  Please?  And you realize how bad they are?  Yes.  And, oh, and here's the other thing about Twisted Sister.  Dee's the only one who came out in costume and kept in shape. 
[02:34:30]  The other three are just fat messes of shit.  Well, because Dee had a career after the band.  He was, you know, keeping himself in shape.  Yeah, those other guys were just working around Long Island.  Yeah, just kind of...  Yeah, Captain Howdy.  Yeah.  All right, Drew.  All right, watch it out, boys.  Thank you.  Okay.  Someone say he's just making fun of himself in that song.  Stop it.  He's not being ironic.  No, he's writing a song where everyone could go, wow, yeah, I remember when I was just, like, rocking out there.  Yeah, I wasn't thinking about 30.  And then 30 came and I'm still rocking. 
[02:35:00]  Came and went.  Yeah.  He wanted it.  Long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.  He definitely wants a hit there.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Ain't gonna happen.  Told you guys...  What?  Joker.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I really appreciate you worm-holing meow songs in my head all day.  What's next?  Banana phone?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Did you say...  Boop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop. 
[02:35:30]  Did you say...  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Did you?  Banana phone.  I haven't heard banana phone in quite some time.  God, I buried that one a long time ago.  Hmm.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  At the end of the video, the guitar player yells,  Ya bitch.  Really?  Kevin from Connecticut. 
[02:36:00]  What's up, Kevin?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  It's not Ya bitch.  It's, yeah, bitch!  Oh, yeah, bitch!  Oh, it's so douchey.  Just play your fucking old songs.  Listen, don't try to even write something new and relevant.  You know when I asked that other caller what other bands were at that thing?  Yeah.  Kyle asked, it just made me laugh.  He's from Indiana.  He just writes, I bet Dawkin was there.  I bet Dawkin was there.  I bet Dawkin was there. 
[02:36:30]  No, apparently Zebra, or what's his name, Randy Jackson, plays at, like, small bars.  Speaking of Dawkin, thanks, Danny.  No, that's Dawkin, Danny.  That's a little different.  That's a picture of Dawkin.  I heard Dawkin.  Not Dawkin.  Looks like one fella needs some fuel.  Yes, they're refueling.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  What's the point of that?  Have you, uh, I just saw a picture of Michael Jackson.  Did you see the, uh, the commemorative lithograph that they're selling on TV now? 
[02:37:00]  Are you kidding?  No.  And they have some fruity-looking guy hanging this thing on the wall and then standing back  and admiring it.  And then there's a second lithograph that you can get, just pay separate shipping.  Um, there it is.  See?  Those are the lithographs.  The thriller cover.  Michael Jackson in his white jacket.  It's the famous thriller cover.  And it can be yours for only $10, plus over-inflated shipping and processing. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, that's the commercial.  A woman's kissing her hand and then puts it on his face on the poster.  Yuck.  Here's a picture of him molesting a child.  And then there's a picture of him, like, in his, I'm a general in some fruity-fucking-army  that he used to wear.  Yeah, he's-  And that's the one where you pay a separate, um, shipping.  I put in, um, I was curious, a little curious.  So I put in shipping and handling scams. 
[02:38:00]  And the first thing that came up was the awesome auger.  Oh, really?  That, the late Billy Mays.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Why, why was there a scam with that?  Well, apparently, if you watch the commercial, um, Billy Mays is telling you, hey, you get  the awesome auger, and, uh, it's like 19 bucks or something like that.  I'm, I'm not even sure how much.  And then, uh, like, eh, maybe, uh, $6 shipping.  And, um, then you're gonna get the drill.  They show this cordless drill. 
[02:38:30]  You're gonna get that and an extender for de-weeding stuff, uh, for free.  They just pay separate shipping.  What they send you is a drill with a cord on it, uh, and the shipping is, I believe  it was $59.  Jesus.  The drill itself is probably worth 19 bucks at a hardware store.  It's just a cheap drill with a cord.  Right.  The cordless drill, they said, was an upgrade that you had to ask for, but there's no way  to ask for it. 
[02:39:00]  And customer service just cuts you off and is nasty with you when you call them.  And if you order either on the phone or online, you go to their, uh, their website, uh, the  first thing they make you do is put in your credit card number.  It's the first thing you have to do.  Put in your name and credit card number.  Then you will continue with, and they never give you a final price of what it costs with  the extra shipping and handling.  It's gotta be a bloody fortune for all these things.  Well, all of them are scams.  Now, if you notice every product that is being sold on infomercials now, it's like, but wait, 
[02:39:30]  if you order now, we'll send you a second one.  Right.  Like you need two of like, like a mop.  I always thought, I always tried, I always wondered why they, I'm like, wow, they give  away a lot of stuff, but that now makes sense.  And then they go, just pay separate shipping and processing.  And, and meanwhile, then it says four to six weeks delivery usually, and the shipping  for four to six weeks is $50.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:40:00]  The fuck are you shipping it by?  Yeah, no kidding.  Tortoise.  No kidding.  So that's a huge scam that's going on.  Why don't we come up with a scam?  Uh, well, we, we should.  Is that the awesome auger?  Sure.  Commercial?  You know it's awesome.  Let's see what he says.  Let me, let me hear what the, cause I know the whole scam now.  See that cordless drill he's holding?  That ain't the one they give you.  Oh, really?  No.  Why not?  They give you a cord drill, cause that cordless drill probably costs a lot more money.  It's a rechargeable cordless drill.  Looks like God had it with Billy Mays.  Everybody loves a beautiful garden, but not the blisters, bending, and backaches that 
[02:40:30]  come with it.  Hi, Billy Mays here with the awesome auger, the world's most efficient and powerful yard  tool you'll ever use.  Just attach it to any size drill.

A whopping $120 value for only $19.95.  Here's how to order.  Go, 1-800.  Every single one of those items is a separate shipping and processing, by the way.  They don't just throw it in one box?  No, no.  It's all separate.  It's all separate, so the drill, the auger, everything is separate, and you wind up paying  so much money for the shipping and processing. 
[02:42:30]  By the way, you could do all that stuff with the one thing.  Yeah, of course.  They're just shorter augers.  It's one fucking thing.  Different size augers.  Short of augers.  They're not as awesome.  You think they dug his grave with the awesome auger?  Oh, wouldn't that be great if they just were out there?  You could dig your own grave with it.  That thing looks like it would fall apart the first little, tiny, little rock or rooted  hits.  Yeah.  Or if you're out with the drill, if it catches on something, the drill's going to spin around 
[02:43:00]  in your hand.  Of course.  You're going to break your wrist.  Yeah.  Wow.  See?  A lot of people have been scammed.  See, thank you, Cody from Colorado.  I was setting up my own joke, but you jumped in.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said we need our own scam, and Cody finished it for me.  Oh, you're running one.  It's called the ONA program.  See?  I was sort of like setting you up, and if you didn't go with it, I was going to grab  it back.  Listen to us from 6 to 11.  Right.  Pay separate shipping and handling.  Right.  For the good stuff. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, a lot of people apparently have been scammed.  So how much?  Someone bought the lithograph?  All right.  Let me ask you something, Ann.  So the auger, you said five separate things?  Yeah.  All right.  So how much does that cost the average person?  Well, the drill itself was like a $50 shipping charge.  So I've heard separate things.  I've heard things where some of it costs $90.  Someone said, I bought something that was $19, advertised as $19, and I wound up paying over  $90 for everything. 
[02:44:00]  And somebody said, you were lucky.  He wound up paying over $125 for the awesome auger.  And then any time you called customer service for them, nothing.  You got nasty people that seemed to be upset because they had so many people calling them  about the scam.  I'm so sick of being ripped off in this world.  Oh, yeah.  The latest one, have we talked about the hotel bills yet?  No.  You know how you talked about the cell phone and you came in here with all the charges 
[02:44:30]  on your cell phone, which is just amazing, because they'll tell you, oh, no, it's only  $19.99 a month or whatever it would be.  And then when you add up all the extra charges and stuff, why don't you just tell them?  I know why they don't, but you got to just tell the consumer, no, it's going to cost you  close to $100 a month or whatever.  Same thing with hotels.  When you're booking hotel rooms, it's like, oh, yeah, the room's $150 a night, let's say.  But by the time you check out, that $150 is closer to, like, $250 because they have 
[02:45:00]  all sorts of taxes.  All sorts of, I need a bill in front of me.  City charges.  Because the stuff they're coming up with now is just amazing.  And then you stay at their hotel and you park your car in their hotel parking lot and that's  an extra charge.  And they charge you for it.  Which drives me fucking nuts, the parking thing.  Yeah.  With sporting events.  I'm a fan.  I'll be going to half the games once again at the Coliseum, right?  I got half a season of tickets and I got to pay to park in their parking lot.  Well, it's not ours, really. 
[02:45:30]  We gave the parking lot away to an independent contractor.  Independent.  So, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  But if you buy a ticket for a sporting event, you should just be able to park for free.  Yeah.  How did this get done without anyone complaining?  I don't know.  A lot of things do, though.  I bought a nice condo here in New York City.  I parked my car in the building.  Oh, no.  That's a separate charge.  Well, the garage doesn't belong to us.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I want to hear from James from Indiana about the lithograph of Michael Jackson. 
[02:46:00]  He didn't buy one of these.  I think he didn't.  James, why would you buy one of these?  Because he's from Indiana.  I didn't buy that.  I bought that stupid motherfucking awesome all this shit.  Oh, okay.  All right.  What do you got, James?  Well, what happened was is when you send out, now here's the catch.  You know what they say?  It's $120 value.  Yeah.  That's the actual cost of the shipping for each, or not each part, but a lot of the parts,  because combined, it comes to $120. 
[02:46:30]  Because when I first sent out for it, they sent me those drill bits.  And then I called back and asked, where the fuck is the rest of it?  I'm supposed to get a sender.  I'm supposed to get a drill.  I'm supposed to get all this other shit.  And they said, no, you got to pay separate shipping and handling for each one, because  it comes from a separate place.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  Yeah, you're supposed to pack it all up in one box and send it.  That pisses me off, too.  Hold on.  That pisses me off, too, because they think we're all just stupid.  It doesn't come from separate places. 
[02:47:00]  Enough people are stupid.  I know, but it's one big fucking factory, and they're going through the bins and going,  all right, this guy needs this, this, and this.  But they're shipping it separately.  It's disgusting.  And it comes to about $120 total if you buy all four.  If you buy one, it's right around $50.  And they're advertising it as $19.95.  Right.  It's hysterical.  I can buy anything but the bits.  I'll just fuck it after that. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  You can put that in your own drill, and it'll work just a good.  Yeah, of course.  Now, James, be honest.  How long did the auger last before it broke in half or you broke your wrist or something happened?  Well, the metal thing came off.  Yeah.  The bits didn't break.  My drill overheated and broke.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  And then this guy says, Dan from North Carolina.  I heard this, too, on the commercial for the lithograph. 
[02:48:00]  We got a couple things going.  I just don't want to lose my latest feedback.  Then we'll go to Dan.  Oh, going to see Government Mule tonight, which is fucking good choice right there.  He writes, I got a room in Pittsburgh for $100.  That's what they said.  $100 a night, right?  After all the charges, it was $210.  Now, is that counting?  Now, I'm not talking about you rent a fucking skin flick or make some phone calls or a mini bar.  I'm talking just those charges.  It's a city charge. 
[02:48:30]  It's a state charge.  It's a...  I don't...  I really need a hotel bill of funding.  Excised tax.  All that shit.  Maybe we could get some kind of bill if we could find one of those.  Dan in North Carolina.  Dan?  Yes?  What's up, sir?  Hey, did you notice that they could only print 30 lithographs per day?  No, they didn't say that.  No, they didn't?  No, no, no, no.  I heard this.  They said there is a limited run on these lithographs.  They can only make lithographs for 30 days, and then they're destroying the press, the print of this. 
[02:49:00]  You know how many...  Do you know how many...  Because they want it to sound like it's a limited offer.  Imagine machines running at lightning speed 24 hours a day for 30 days.  How many of these fucking things you could pump out?  If you wanted to.  It's amazing.  It's a scam.  They're not the best.  The infomercial down here, the girl is standing by the piano with four of them. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, four.  Exactly.  And separate shipping and processing for all four.  Why would you want to be surrounded by four pictures of Michael Jackson?  Well, that's a whole other story.  You should see the creeps they have on this commercial.  This one guy is such a creep.  He's staring at the picture, and then he straightens it and walks away.  And as he walks away, it gets crooked again.  Really?  That's perfect.  All right, guys.  That's perfect.  That guy's just bummed that Michael Jackson didn't put it in his hiney.  Yeah.  There she is by the piano. 
[02:50:00]  You want to hear this?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  It's brought joy to millions around the world.  Join us in this tribute to Michael Jackson by the American Historic Society.

As a special thanks for honoring Michael, who will also include the commemorative  lithograph with legendary Michael Jackson shown in his regal attire.  You get pulled?  Just a separate shipping and handling.  Oh!  Just a separate shipping.  Oh, separate.  See?  Dude, that is the new scam.  Why the fuck?  It's the new scam that no one's fucking talking about.  You could put it in a slightly bigger box.  Yeah.  And then maybe go, all right, well, you're getting two instead of one.  All right, we're going to have to charge an extra five bucks. 
[02:51:30]  That's where the money comes from.  The product they're selling is a widget.  God damn it.  It doesn't matter.  It's the fucking widget.  It's a thingamajig.  You're fine.  A whoosimabob.  It doesn't matter what they're selling.  The shipping and handling is the biggest scam out there right now.  God damn it, and you're brilliant.  Thank you.  Here's another scam.  Yeah.  The extra charges I really want to talk about a little bit today.  This guy doesn't give his name, unfortunately, but he writes.  Oh, less than three, I guess, on his phone.  Oh, don't forget rental cars. 
[02:52:00]  Rent a van for my sister's bachelorette party at $120 a day.  You go, good news, and then you call all your buddies.  Dude, I got it for $120.  Really?  Holy shit, that's awesome.  And then you get the bill after you're done partying and doing your thing.  In this case, the $120 a day ended up costing $280 for 20 hours.  Oh.  How?  So that means it's not $120 a day. 
[02:52:30]  $120 a day in my world means $120 a day.  Thank you, Anthony.  There's nothing that costs what they say it costs.  It just doesn't work.  Well, someone said check your Twitter because they got a hotel bill maybe.  Oh, yeah?  So, yeah, your separate, sorry, shipping and, yeah, that's, I didn't even realize that was going on.  It's a huge scam, and I've noticed it for the past probably a couple of months now that it's like every product now is doing this. 
[02:53:00]  And even when you hear separate shipping, the average person, I'll just speak for myself, I would think, okay, maybe seven extra dollars.  And you're going to assume it's the same shipping as the initial thing.  Because sometimes they tell you shipping is seven bucks on something that costs 20 bucks.  So it's like $27.  And we'll send you the second one for free, pay separate shipping and handling.  Now that shipping for the same product is $50. 
[02:53:30]  Right.  How do they justify that?  By the way, stopping the show just to read Just Crazy's tweet to me.  How has this helped me, Just Crazy?  He writes, I can't call, but I can clarify all those hotel charges you're talking about.  I work for a well-known hotel company.  Yeah?  What?  How does that help our discussion, Just Crazy?  Thanks for help, because he's Just Crazy.  He's Just Crazy. 
[02:54:00]  He's Just Crazy.  The money-back guarantees are bullshit, too.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Let's go to David in PA.  David.  People can never get their money back.  There you go.  Hey.  Yeah.  You know, they always say money-back guarantee or 30-day money-back guarantee.  But if you look at it, it always says less the shipping and handling.  So if you're paying $20 for a product and $50 for shipping, and you get the product and say,  this is a piece of shit.  I want to send it back.  You kiss your shipping and handling goodbye. 
[02:54:30]  That's a restocking fee, also.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  A restocking fee.  I also heard you look at what the shipping cost is.  You know, like when you said, you paid something for $20, and then they said the shipping is  $7, that that product probably, that you're buying, is probably only costing them less than  $7.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they're covering their cost.  Yeah, the price is all gravy for them.  Amazing.  Goddamn.  Who knew Billy Mays was such a fucking shyster?  God did. 
[02:55:00]  I guess God just needed another shyster.  Yeah, God definitely did.  He said, fuck that.  There's hardworking people out there you're ripping off.  All right.  See you, boys.  Oh, nothing bad.  Oh, okay.  No.  I didn't see it.  Oh, you didn't see it?  No.  Someone is suggesting we check out, well, here, because I don't want everyone to go there  and fuck us up.  That's all.  Oh, yeah.  I don't even know if it's good.  You know what it is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have no idea.  I was just seeing if we wanted to go in that direction. 
[02:55:30]  That's all.  Opi, I can't call the show, but I can tell you about the awesome auger, the Michael Jackson  poster, and the proper way to eat an asshole.  But he can't call.  But he can't call, no.  Yeah, just crazy.  What the fuck was that?  It was a dumb Twitter.  Right.  Oh, shit.  What is the shake weights?  The shake weights look like, girl, jerking off. 
[02:56:00]  The summer dresses, the bathing suits.  What the hell is a shake weight?  And be free to go sleeveless.  The shake weight is based on a completely new workout technology called dynamic inertia,  which ignites the muscles in your arms, shoulders, and chest, so you feel them tightening  and turning instantly, giving you visible results in just six minutes a day.

Yeah.  What do you masturbate with?  Well, no, not even that.  There's a ton of products out there that they know that they're putting it on the market,  knowing women are going to pick up these products and, you know,  have sex with it.  And just start diddling.  A lot of like, what was the one we, I'm trying to remember some of the ones. 
[02:58:00]  Was it the deodorant?  A lot of deodorants.  Tickle deodorant was a good one.  Have the smooth, smooth head for her pleasure.  And then the body massagers are great.  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  They're shaped like dicks.  Yeah.  Like they're not sitting on those things.  A body massager should be something that perhaps covers a wider area or something.  And, uh, no, they're, they're made just for clitoral stimulation. 
[02:58:30]  I remember like in the back of like those terrible, you know, catalogs, like Avon catalog  or whatever it was, there would be like some woman holding a just completely legitimate  vibrator.  Like it was, it wasn't one of those body massagers.  A dildo.  It was a vibrator.  Yeah.  And she's actually smiling and like putting it on like on her shoulder and neck or something.  It's like, dude, that's a vibrator.  Like that's not a back massager.  It's not made for anything colored.  It's, it's like shaped like a dick.  It's for shoving in you.  Yeah.  She's working out a neck kink with a big doofy smile. 
[02:59:00]  Thank you.  Blue Healer.  Remember the Harry Potter vibrating broom?  Oh yeah.  They had to take that one off the market.  Oh yeah.  Kids were fucking going into their room and locking the door with that one.  Yeah.  They were learning a trick or two.  Yeah.  I can explain the shipping and handling fees.  It's Ron in Arizona.  Ron.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, the process, that stuff goes through and you pay for every step of it.  It comes from a boat from China into a seaport, into a container, comes to the Midwest, from 
[02:59:30]  the Midwest, back to wherever you live, to like UPS.  And, you know, they've thrown it into containers and boxes and if they lose it, you pay for it  again.  You're making it sound like this is a legitimate cost.  No, it's not legitimate.  But unfortunately, it happens with everything, even from the shoes in the stores to just  regular stuff that you're not even ordering through the mail.  If you actually, dude, if you actually broke it down, when there's a container ship full 
[03:00:00]  of containers of fucking these horrid products, the shipping doesn't amount to anything per  piece.  You know what I mean?  You're exactly right.  It doesn't.  That's where that's where you're getting ripped off.  Yeah.  Well, if you get lost in the process, you get screwed shipping.  I could think they're trying to make it legitimate.  It's not.  But I've shipped.  I've shipped shit overnight.  I've overnighted stuff that is smaller or bigger than the stuff that they're selling. 
[03:00:30]  And it's cheaper than what they're charging for four to six weeks for delivery.  That's because you're a small businessman and you're at a giant company.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Sure.  But these giant companies, they just ship it all at once and they just, it costs them  like five or ten cents to ship it and they're charging us out the ass.  And we're just all getting screwed with it.  All right, man.  All right, bro.  You guys have a good day. 
[03:01:00]  You too, sir.  Wow.  A lot of stuff coming in now.  Gillette Mach 5 Razor that vibrates.  What's wrong with those?  Well, but it doesn't vibrate.  But, you know, the girls are, you know.  Oh, they're using the, of course they are.  That sounds dangerous.  But we need the women to call to admit this shit.  Not us.  Not us guys just imagining some cool shit.  Here, listen to this one.  Let's go to John in Albany.  John.  Hey.  I was staying at the Weston in Buckhead, Atlanta. 
[03:01:30]  And they charge you $30 each time you get your car out of valet parking.  Oof.  You're already staying at their hotel.  They got you.  And they're like, no, how can we...  And they charge a valet fee.  Yeah.  And then they charge an additional $30 each time you get it up.  Yeah, how can we get more money off these saps?  Yeah, every time he wants his own fucking car, we'll charge him $30.  Brilliant.  You're paying to be there.  And you don't know this going into it for the most part. 
[03:02:00]  What more do they want?  Um, HumpX writes...  HumpX?  The HumpX Inn.  Yeah, wow.  Oh my God.  Go to the site and then try to leave.  I'm not even going to give the site because people will get pissed off.  He writes, you actually have to shut down the browser for fuck's sake.  Really?  And it's for the Augur.  It's one of the sites for the Augur.  You can't even get off the site.  You want to try it then?  Those bastards.  You know which one?  You see it?  Oh, there it is.  All right, let's see.  All right.  Now I'm just going to be like, well, I want that. 
[03:02:30]  I'm going to go to Google.  Oh, Jesus.  What's going on?  Oh, there you go.  You got to jump through a couple of hoops.  But what are those hoops?  Like, what did you just do?  They made you click something.  Yeah, you had to like, you know, are you sure you want to navigate away from this page?  You know, click OK.  This page is awesome!  That sucks.  It's amazing he's dead and he's still annoying people. 
[03:03:00]  Biggest scams.  Well, let's say hi to Kevin.  Kevin?  Good evening.  Good evening, sir.  Hey, one of the biggest scams is online plane tickets.  You see a price online, you call and order your ticket.  You get to the airport, it's double the price.  And then to top it all off, then they charge me twice for a ticket.  I bought somebody a ticket to go to Las Vegas.  All right.  Yeah.  Punch it out, guys. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  People don't know what the Mach 5 Razor is yet.  Well, Matt Lamb in New York City, I actually got one of these.  Yeah.  The fucking Razor actually vibrates, which makes it easier to shave.  You put a little AAA battery in the handle.  Yeah, yeah.  And then it just vibrates enough where you could get a pretty good shave.  But you've got to think the women are, you know.  Put in the right spot with the cover on it, perhaps.  So I don't know what...  How do you keep from cutting your clitoris off?  But how about a girl who's just, you know... 
[03:04:00]  Oh, I'm going to try it on my ball bag.  Yes.  All right.  I'm going to try it on my ball bag tonight.  I'll have, hopefully, a report tomorrow.  Let me say hi to Rob in Wyoming.  Rob.  Good evening, guys.  Hey, buddy.  To discuss more on the hotel raping, I've got a ticket right in front of me from a certain Holiday Inn.  Okay.  Okay, they charge me state tax is $8. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  City tax is $7.  Okay.  County tax is $11.  All right, slow down.  And lodging.  Wait, you hear that?  State?  Yeah.  City?  You said county?  Yeah, no.  I've got a county tax of $11 and a lodging tax of $6.  Lodging tax.  What is a lodging tax?  Isn't that just the cost of the room it should be added to?  I'm lodging.  I'm paying to lodge.  Is this a politician thing? 
[03:05:00]  Where's the lodging tax going?  Is this a politician thing where the politicians were able to get this done?  How is this done?  Where they charge you a state, city, county, and lodging tax on your fucking room?  Yeah, that's on top of just the room accommodations itself.  That's nothing else.  Yeah.  So now you're, let's say the hotel room was, what, $100 maybe?  Yeah, $120.  So $15.  You just gave me $26 extra right there.  Right there.  Yep.  That is such, it's a crime. 
[03:05:30]  It's a crime.  And you know the airlines are going to start charging you to actually have luggage on  their plane, right?  Yeah.  Well, they already are.  Well, they kind of do it with the oversized luggage for the most part.  Now they're doing it for two bags.  I haven't gone through that yet.  Wait.  Yep.  If you have two bags.  I'm pretty sure if you have two bags.  Yeah, but you know what they're doing?  What?  They're softening the blow.  Oh, they want to, yes.  Eventually it'll be like, okay, and if you want to take a luggage, why would you?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  If you're flying.  And that's how they're going to present it to you.  Yeah.  If you want to, like, take a luggage, that'll be an extra $15 per bag.  Yeah.  But you have no choice.  You know what I mean?  I am Mr. Carry-on now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I have gotten so good at packing clothes or whatever I need to take in.  What I use is I got a little roller suitcase that fits in the overhead.  It's totally legit.  It fits in there a little.  It has to be this big.  And the big 511 backpack. 
[03:06:30]  And you're good at that.  So now that's my personal item, my one carry-on item.  And I can pack anything I need in that.  I'm so with you now.  And no more standing in that fucking carousel.  No way in your bag and fucking paying extra for it.  Screw them.  Flying into New York.  Maybe it's like this in other airports.  My experience is New York.  Let's say you go on a nice vacation.  You come back on a Sunday.  And all you want to do is be in your house now.  You're just tired.  You had a good week.  And you will spend an hour, hour and a half waiting for your luggage. 
[03:07:00]  Because Sunday they don't have as many people on.  And now they're just slowly, you know, unloading these planes.  And you sit.  And you sit.  And you sit.  It's so mad.  When that plane lands on time.  And you can just wheel out of the airport.  And you're like, oh, this is great.  You don't realize it's going to be another hour and a half before you actually get home.  At times, yeah.  Or something, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when you're all carry-on, it's like, well, I'm out of here. 
[03:07:30]  That's it.  Walk right out that door.  Grab a cab.  Whatever.  Uh-oh.  Eric Conner from Boston.  There was an article in The Globe last week about Menino wanting to raise the hotel tax  in Bofferson.  Bofferson.  Bofferson.  The best is there.  There's a video.  Boston.com slash news slash local slash Massachusetts slash articles slash 2009 slash 07 slash 22 slash  higher.  Is that an underscore?  Underscore.  Is there a hyper slam? 
[03:08:00]  Underscore meal.  Underscore hotel.  Underscore taxes.  Underscore in.  Underscore works.  Underscore for.  Underscore Boston.  Backslash.  Can you find that, Danny?  No, bro.  Did you get that?  Is it an underscore when the line's like, what is that?  Like lower than a cross-out line.  Yeah.  That's what I call it.  Yeah.  Lower than the cross-out line.  Underscore.  Underscore.  Underscore.  All we're hoping is that Mayor Menino's talking here.  That's all.  Ampersand? 
[03:08:30]  You don't have to put in an ampersand?  Oh, is this Menino?  Oh, please.  Boston Mayor Tom Menino is making his case today for a hike in the city's meal and hotel taxes.  All right, stop.  Menino wants to raise the hotel tax by...  How the fuck do these politicians get this done?  And you can love Obama all you want, man, but he's just like the rest of them.  No, you know what it is?  Let me tell you something.  Obama started this trend. 
[03:09:00]  This was before Obama.  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  A lot of this stuff, you're right.  It was there.  All these surcharges and these extra taxes and all this other bullshit.  They're now raising these things.  It's the Michael Jackson commercial.  But raising these things now because they say they're broke, Obama opened the floodgates on that one.  He did it.  And now local governments are going, well, we can tax this.  We can tax that.  We can tax it.  And now you're screwed.  Bullshit.  They all suck.  Let's hear Menino.  I hope he talks. 
[03:09:30]  Wait a minute.  Speaking of the Michael Jackson thing, we're covering way too much right now, but just focus a little bit out there.  We're being taken as humans.  Bill in Arkansas, because you were like, the printing of the lithographs?  Yeah.  30 print days.  30 print days.  This guy actually knows something about printing a lithograph.  Okay.  Because they make it sound like if you get this, hold on, if you get one of these Michael Jackson lithographs, you've got something very special.  Because there's only 30 print days, and then they destroy the mold.  You're feeling like you've got a Walter Johnson baseball card. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, that's amazing.  Was it the Walter Johnson that was really valuable?  I don't know.  Whatever.  Go ahead there, Bill.  Well, my family's been in the printing business since the early 70s, and I can tell you the way they're doing this is almost certainly done on a web press,  which means they can produce probably in the ballpark of 5 million of these things every day.  5 million a day.  Now, to put that in context, too, as far as cost, the company that prints them would be more than proud and happy to do this for less than 2 cents apiece. 
[03:10:30]  So their total cost on this is less than 2 cents apiece on the actual job itself.  What a fucking scam.  Limited edition, only 5 million a day.  So what does that come out to?  That's just one for every two people in the country, Andy.  5, 3, yeah.  150 million?  How is yours worth anything if there's 158 million of them out there?  And there can't be that many people buying it.  That's like three quarters. 
[03:11:00]  Well, don't worry.  If you want a lithograph, if you're one of those dummies, you're going to get your lithograph.  Yeah.  Only two per family.  Okay.  Where are we going in?  Because I've got a hotel guy, too, that's standing by.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let it rip.  All right.  Derek in Chicago.  Derek.  Yeah, just to touch base, that is a city-based tax, because daily, that son of a bitch wanted  to raise the taxes even more.  It's already at 15.4% per room.  He wanted to raise, like, another 3% for the stupid hotel tax.  And also, a hotel scam, for a gallon of coffee, they charge you $30 per gallon if you have a 
[03:11:30]  meeting there.  It costs us $0.09 to make that gallon.  It's enough.  Enough with taking money out of our fucking pockets.  The answer was Honus Wagner.  Thank you.  Oh, Honus Wagner.  Thank you, sir.  Yes, of course.  Coke Logic.  Hey, oh, very blue heeler from Kentucky.  Holy crap.  Obi, check this out.  HTTP.  All right.  We'll just go to www.google.com, slash, search, question mark, H-L, equals, E-N, APRIFOR, L-R, 
[03:12:00]  equals, APRIFOR, C, 2, C-O-F-F, equals, sign, 1, APRIFOR, R-I-S, equal, get the idea.  Yeah.  He likes the reading of the website.  Yes.  All right.  Should we go back to Menino, then?  Yeah.  Let's see Menino.  Mayor Menino.  And his thing.  Here we go.  Mayor Tom Menino is making his case today for a hike in the city's meal and hotel taxes. 
[03:12:30]  Menino wants to raise the hotel tax by 2% and add a three-quarters of a percent tax onto restaurant bills.  That's in addition to the newly increased state sales tax that goes into effect August 1st.  Our business reporter, Peter Howe, joins us now with more.  Peter?  Yeah, thanks, Chet and Beth.  It was just last month that legislators and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick agreed to give cities and towns  around the Bay State, new local option authority to levy higher hotel and meals taxes. 
[03:13:00]  And the basic idea from Beacon Hill was, we will let you local governments get more tax money,  but you will have to take the political heat for it.  Now, Mayor Menino is stepping up, and he's getting significant support both from hospitality industry leaders  and some people who would pay these higher taxes.  Why?  Because you're stupid.  David Halpin and his family from Florida were enjoying a four-day swing through Boston  as part of a two-week vacation up north, seeing Quincy Market the same day Mayor Menino  proposed raising the hotel tax by 2%. 
[03:13:30]  Halpin's reaction?  It wouldn't bother us at all.  The mayor and city council should hope there are a lot more visitors like David, Bonnie,  and their boys Cole and Ty.  A 2% increase in a hotel tax would not stop us from visiting this beautiful city.  The city has a lot to offer.  Pause!  Because Anthony Comey had taught me a little something about taxes.  Yeah, the 2%, you're right.  That's great.  What's 2%?  What's 2%?  Right?  But that's on the other 2% a few years back, and then there's this little tax over here. 
[03:14:00]  And because it's only 2%, guess what?  Then in another year or two, they're going to give you another little 2% or 3%.  Another 2%.  It's the boiling of the lobster thing.  Yes.  You slowly boil a lobster, you're not going to see much action, right?  Or you slowly boil anything, I really should say.  Yeah.  But you throw somebody in a boiling pot of water, they're going to scream bloody murder.  That's what happens.  You stupid dummy.  Oh, that guy doesn't care.  I see it, because that's America right there.  That's the idiot.  And that's why they can get it done. 
[03:14:30]  Exactly.  Because you buy right into it.  Ah, 2% here, what's that?  It's nothing.  Who cares?  That's not going to bother me.  It's only 2%.  And then, you know what?  Next time you go away, look at your hotel bill and see all the little 2%s they were able  to sneak by you.  Mayor's plan to meet with the representatives of the Hotel Restaurant Institute today to discuss  a proposed package that would raise the hotel tax another 2% points to a total of  14.45% in state and city taxes.  So this guy doesn't care 2%.  No, he doesn't care.  But you're already paying 12.45%. 
[03:15:00]  Well, now this will make it 7 individual 2%s, you dummy.  And the meal tax is another 0.75 percentage point.  That ain't nothing.  That's nothing.  So anybody can pay that, right?  So tag it on to the 6.25% for a total of 7% now in new taxes.  How do they get away with that?  40%.  So that's going to be 14%.  14.45%.  So 14.5% in state and city taxes on your room, right?  21.5%. 
[03:15:30]  And then another 7%.  Okay, yeah, 21.5%.  Yeah, that's no big deal, right?  21.5% tax on your fucking room.  By the way, you're paying for this with money that has already been taxed.  That is my favorite thing ever.  The money you're paying that tax with has already been taxed.  Right.  Through income tax.  People are arguing the boiling of an animal thing.  You get our point.  You get the point.  If you're in water and it slowly gets hotter, you're going to hang in there for a long fucking time. 
[03:16:00]  You know what?  Holy shit, it's getting hot in here.  I've got to get the fuck out.  But if you go into something that's really hot right off the bat, you're not going to want any part of it.  Makes your balls hurt.  Makes them nice.  Like the hot tub.  Makes them nice and red.  Yeah.  Big red ball bags.  Spy report.  Oh.  We've got a Ron and Fez spy report.  Really?  They're letting OJ out?  Dirty Ralph?  No. 
[03:16:30]  I heard they might be doing this.  Why?  They're letting OJ out of prison for a retrial?  For what?  I hope, hopefully for the murder.  That's ridiculous.  Do we have any Mayor Menino audio?  Because that's the only reason I wanted to hear that dummy speak.  No, no, he didn't do that.  Oh, that was the end of the clip there, Dan?  Oh, was it?  Menino.  Oh, there he is.  Maybe, maybe.  Hopefully.  They make a difference in people's needs.  It's going to real programs that make a difference in people's lives. 
[03:17:00]  And like education.  He's asking the city council by August 29 to raise the hotel tax 2% and restaurant and meals tax is 0.75%.  That's what state legislators and Governor Patrick...  Oh, he talks a little more.  ...just authorized.  We should have been done a long time ago.  We're just playing catch-up now because of the issues we have before us for the budgets.  Mayor Menino and industry officials say that when these catch-up increases go through, 
[03:17:30]  visitors to Boston will still pay a lot less in hotel and meals taxes than visitors do in New York, Chicago, or Philadelphia.  If Boston...  It's ridiculous.  Huh?  It's so goddamn ridiculous.  How?  21%.  That's not even...  I don't even think that is the...  And then there's another tax on top of that, right?  Just a regular, regular tax that we all know?  That's just your fucking, you know, Mayor Menino tax.  Right.  Like fat tongue tax. 
[03:18:00]  I gotta eat.  I'm, like, sitting here.  It's okay.  Oh, my God.  We can take a break and continue.  Brian in Ohio, that's what they get for voting in this puke year after year.  You know what, though?  The other guy that would take his place, you think he...  It's gonna be that much different?  Citadel Broadcasting is 22 cents this morning.  Why would John want to talk about that?  What?  Did it go up?  I think it went up.  John, are you trying to tell us that our stock went up?  Uh, yeah. 
[03:18:30]  Hmm.  22 cents.  Might want to look at that.  Well, we...  Time to sell.  We bought in at $19 a share.  Going up to 22 cents isn't gonna really make us that much happen.  No.  Yeah, but that's like 2200% from a penny.  Oh, it was down to a penny?  It was, wasn't it?  I don't know.  I think it was close.  I think it was single digits.  I can't even check it because it's not even on the...  I don't even want it.  ...exchange anymore.  I was telling that story again this weekend.  And people...  Their tongues actually fall out of their mouths.  Oh, I know.  When I tell them the Citadel story. 
[03:19:00]  Wait, you turned $100,000 into what?  What did we figure out?  We could barely get like an eye touch or something?  Yeah.  For the $100,000 that we invested?  Yeah, for $100,000.  Their tongues actually fall out of their mouths.  Thanks.  Thank you, John.  Yep, Rick.  All right, Ed's got to get some food in him.  So why don't we take a break?  Just in case you missed it earlier,  Tiger Woods farted this Sunday  as he was just about to win another golf tournament.  And CBS and PGA and the PGA  are trying to squash all the videos of this for some reason.  It's just a good moment. 
[03:19:30]  Who gives a crap?  It's funny.  Here's the audio in case you missed it this past Sunday.  Let it release a little bit more.  Tiger waits.  It's interesting that all three of his 09 wins.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature  is proud to present a collection of books on tape  soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippi Tung.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it with an hour. 
[03:20:00]  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom. 
[03:20:30]  Good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way  through Mark Twain's classic,  Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth.  Are you kidding?  Bad news, Anthony.  You know the Citadel stock that was at 22 cents?  Yeah.  The guy that called can't do math.  Why?  Thank you, Bryant, who can do math.  He's from Syracuse.  He writes,  Bullshit.  Citadel is not at 22 cents. 
[03:21:00]  It's at .3 cents right now.  No way.  It's up from .0022.  No, wait.  It's up .0022 today.  Fucking idiot.  So it's .3 cents.  .3 cents.  So you can basically buy three shares of Citadel stock  for just under a penny. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  Our stock that used to be worth $19 a share.  I think what the guy was trying to say  was that it was up .22 hundredths of a cent.  Right.  Not .22 cents.  Dude, if it was .22 cents, man,  we would be selling.  Living large.  It's .3 cents per share.  So you can get a little over three shares per cent.  That's amazing.  That is amazingly ridiculous.  You know,  Fareed got married?  Did he?  He got remarried? 
[03:22:00]  Should have sent him a gift.  What?  Fucking stock certificate.  Here you go.  In a card.  I still have the certificate.  I think the card would cost more.  Yeah, yeah.  It would.  I still have the certificate.  I want to just hang it up on the wall as a reminder.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's worth something.  Yeah.  It's art now.  We should put our Citadel stock certificates online  and give it to the highest bidder.  Yeah.  There it is.  We'll autograph it.  We'll wipe our asses. 
[03:22:30]  Whatever you need us to do with it  so the cost goes up.  I don't care.  Then the fucking nigga get bought by someone  and go up to fucking 20 bucks a share.  Is it really going to go up?  Yeah.  No.  I'm running out of shows,  so we got some speed round shit.  Mmm.  I just learned something.  I don't know if you want to do it now or tomorrow, Ant,  but remember Simple Mike?  Yes.  He quit for real.  Now, why would Simple Mike quit?  Do you want to go down this road?  Because he's simple.  And he handed in his last Simple Mike bit. 
[03:23:00]  Do you want to do this before you leave?  You hand in a bit before you retire?  Is that what...  He quit?  Why did he quit?  Hold on.  Well, I'm giving you options here, Ant.  Let's make a deal.  We got that.  We got the funeral home that displays body with open wound  from the autopsy during wake.  Family is suing.  Yeah, that's probably not good.  We got interns Nick and Charlie.  They just handed in a commercial called Randy's Ravioli.  I almost said Ravioli. 
[03:23:30]  Rob.  Randy's Ravioli.  We might need some time with this Simple Mike bit  is what I'm thinking.  Okay.  We got the Seth Rogen Tabernacle Choir worth another listen.  Man arrested after a Monopoly game turns violent.  Mm-hmm.  Those are usually...  Or man tries to sell baby for $100 for drugs.  Jesus.  Fuckin' cheap.  What do you want?  I think we got to take a peek at the funeral home thing.  Yeah, just to see what it is, I guess, and then...  You really want the Simple Mike, don't you? 
[03:24:00]  Well, I just want to know why he quit.  We could probably make it fast.  Most people don't even know who Simple Mike is.  First, the funeral home.  One of the big stories today.  He didn't look down on this.  It was his son's wake, a June 1st public viewing of the body attended by more than 75 mourners.  We cannot show you the photos they're looking at, but the family's reaction tells you all  you need to know.  No feelings for the family.  That's the last thing we wanted to see him that way. 
[03:24:30]  William's brother, Fernando, died in his own bed at the age of 43.  He had a lot of health problems, but to pinpoint the exact cause of death, an official autopsy  was ordered.  Without getting overly graphic, suffice it to say, evidence of that autopsy was clearly  visible here during the five-hour open casket wake.  So, where's the...  I don't get it.  Well, what the hell was he wearing?  Yeah.  It might have been, what, they cut open his brain or something?  Open shirt or something, or the brain?  The shirt couldn't have been open. 
[03:25:00]  I don't know.  Well, I'm trying to think where this wound would be.  Uh, Anthony, very good news.  Yeah?  Keith J. has a great idea from Niagara Falls.  We sell the stock with separate shipping for each share.  Oh, that's a good idea.  All right on.  Uh-oh.  I think Danny found some more details on this, um...  You got the pictures?  No, but I'm reading some more.  I don't know if the description is in the audio.  All right, let me see.  Before we go to you.  Everyone was shocked.  Like, what's this? 
[03:25:30]  Um, everyone kept asking, was he killed?  Was he hid in the head?  The funeral director told you what?  That...  That's how he came from the examiner's office.  So he blamed it on the medical examiner?  Yeah.  Passed the bus.  He sure did.  The crux of the lawsuit is that funeral homes are bound under long-standing common law  to protect grieving families from such horror.  Repeated requests for comment from La Paz have never gone beyond,  we did the best we could.  All right, listen.  If you're going to do this story as a local news station,  you got to tell us what the fuck the wound is. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  We had to go on the internet to find out for ourselves.  This is a who-gives-a-shit story unless you give more details.  Uh, it says,  Bleeding, he said.  There were exposed wires.  There were flies going in and out of the wound.  In fact, by the end of the funeral, the flies buzzing around the body's open wound  became so persistent, the funeral home placed a white veil over the corpse's head to protect it.  There was a hole behind the dead man's right ear that appeared to be seeping blood. 
[03:26:30]  Two witnesses told CBS 2 HD.  There were bloodstains on the pillow and wires that appeared to be autopsy sutures,  visible holding a loose flap of skin to the back of his hairline.  The corpse was a dark, bluish color in spots.  The ears looked especially discolored.  Jesus.  That's wonderful, ain't it?  Wow.  That's an api story.  That one is not good. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, no.  I don't, um, I don't look at the body at wigs.  I go in.  I look out of curiosity.  And then I get that horrible, like, glance over.  I go, why'd you do that?  And then when you're supposed to walk up to the coffin and give you, like, respect, I don't do that.  I walk up and I look down and I just go, oh, my God, okay, have I been here long enough where people think I'm praying?  I don't really pray.  Okay, let me get the bug up and I'm going to walk away. 
[03:27:30]  Because I don't want to see somebody I know dead like that.  So I don't.  They just look like clay people.  I know.  Terrible.  They don't look real.  I don't do that.  That's old school, by the way.  What?  The newer generation doesn't go for that as much.  You mostly see the old people in the open caskets.  Yeah.  Nice picture.  And the makeup is always just like, that person.  Oh, like my grandmothers?  I was just hearing.  Oh, she looks so good. 
[03:28:00]  Because she looks better than she did when she was at the home.  Oh, yeah.  They did such a good job with the makeup.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Is Danny showing dead people?  Oh, look at that.  Wait, you saw this.  What is this site?  Why is a woman in a coffin with a fork and a cat?  Is the cat dead, too?  Probably.  I would hope so.  What do you throw in Google Image for this stuff? 
[03:28:30]  Right now, I'm just working on an open casket, but I'm trying to find better stuff.  All right, good.  Please search.  And you want the commercial that the boys did, interns Nick and Charlie?  Nick and Charlie.  You said you got a little chuckle out of this.  Yeah, commercial parody.  Okay.  Yeah, let's give a little.  We're in the middle of a little speed round here.  This is called Randy's Ravioli.  Hey, guys.  What are you snacking on?  Potato chips.  Yeah, potato chips. 
[03:29:00]  Potato chips?  Fuck that shit.  Want to have a real snack, bitch?  Frozen ravioli.  Frozen fucking raviolis.  Like that shit.  Ah, my teeth.  Fucking right, your teeth.  Now you eat one.  I don't want to.  Do it, pussy.  The fuck is your problem?  Eat that shit.  Ah, my tooth, bro.  Fucking right, that shit, then. 
[03:29:30]  That's how you know it's good, dick.  Go to the fucking store.  Pick up some frozen fucking raviolis.  Do it, pussy.  Frozen raviolis.  Real ass shit.  Real ass snack.  Randy's raviolis.  They're fucking frozen.  What the fuck?  Where did you come off with that idea?  We were all sitting in the office a couple weeks ago, and we were talking about potato chips,  and Charlie said that they're a waste of time.  He'd rather have a bag of frozen ravioli, and Steve said, make a commercial about frozen ravioli. 
[03:30:00]  Of course, Steve did.  That's how it always happened.  Fucking Steve.  Why don't you make a commercial about that?  He obviously told you this on a Tuesday, because we all know Mondays he...  Holy shit.  Wow.  Well, the mix sucked.  Yeah.  Dirk didn't feel like being part of your project?  I don't know.  Yeah, the high voice thing was a little...  No, I mean, the mix is a little off.  No, the mix is a little off, but I like...  I like the energy and the, like, fucking frozen ravioli. 
[03:30:30]  Like, that was funny.  But the high voice thing with that on my tooth, there was a little...  Who did that one?  They're supposed to be, like, little kids.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, then they just get, like, emotionally abused by this adult.  Yeah, that didn't quite work.  I like the angry voice thing.  It was very good.  Thank you.  Yeah, it was definitely all right.  There's just some passion in there.  What happened with Simple Mike?  We came in on a Tuesday, and no one had seen or spoken to him for a couple days. 
[03:31:00]  And then we called him, and he didn't answer.  Then the following day, Steve told us that he quit on account of scheduling conflicts.  Ah, scheduling conflicts.  Which was clearly bullshit.  Did you guys drive him nuts?  I think so.  Every conversation we had, he always just got real defensive and would have no part of it and got real angry.  Yes, sir.  Sam is here to instigate.  Boy, what a surprise.  Sam knows something about this.  Well, one of Simple Mike's last days, I caught him.  Well, one of the interns alerted me.  I don't remember which one. 
[03:31:30]  He was sitting out here in the intern area on the floor with his back against the wall and his head in between his knees  because he couldn't understand why he was being so disrespected by all of the interns.  Ah.  And so he had to sit there and center himself for 20 minutes.  Yeah.  And then he came back with scheduling conflicts.  And he handed in his final bit, which is called Simple Mike and Pierce Present Bro Chill News for Bros by Bros. 
[03:32:00]  Well, yeah.  Bro Chill.  It's something that they've been working on.  I wish Pierce is not here today, so we'll have to tell him about it when he's here next.  But, yes, Bro Chill, I caught them doing characters one day outside the office just saying bro a lot.  What's up, bro?  And adding the syllable of bro in place of multi-syllable words.  You know, for instance, maybe the first syllable of a word, like Bro-Sissippi for Mississippi. 
[03:32:30]  Ah, see, that's funny.  Right.  Something like that.  And I said...  Bro-man.  Didn't we just do the bro-tabular, though, a few months back?  That guy had that book?  This is different.  And so I said...  This is different.  All right.  And so I said, you know, that this has some potential and that they should develop this into, like, a skit.  Unfortunately, he quit, and this is only the first one because I thought this might be something recurring.  A series.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, maybe you should give it to Nick.  Nick looks like he wants to do the bro news. 
[03:33:00]  Absolutely.  The bro chill news.  Absolutely, man.  I had to sit next to him the three days they were riding it, and it drove me up a fucking wall.  Wow.  Really?  Because he's not as creative as they are.  Yeah, definitely.  Get jealous.  Sup, bros?  Welcome to the first episode of Bro Chill.  News for bros, by bros.  This is your host, T-Chet, and I'm here chilling with my bro, Hoj.  Sup?  Word on the street is that the yen is making seriously gay moves against the euro and the dollar.  Has Bernanke done anything about this?  Yeah, his usual, bro.  He's quoted saying that we will need to tighten the monetary policy to prevent the emergence 
[03:33:30]  of an inflation problem.  We're totally, like, dealing with a highly volatile economy.  Further restrictions are, like, gonna get this country back on track, bro.  Faster than I can chug a beard.  Bro, chill.  Further policy and regulation is not what we need.  We need to make government, like the freshman year pussy I slay routinely, smaller and tighter.  Get that bum-ass Republican policy out of this jam-seach, dude.  Bro, are you shitting me?  Remember what the economy looked like when I was ripping crank shots in high school? 
[03:34:00]  Bro, Bernanke's coaching a better game with more transparency.  Yeah, dude, transparency is great.  Especially when everything Bernanke says sends the market into a fucking tizzy.  Bro-nanky can give me a douche show sometimes.  Bro, Bernanke is not a bro, bro.  Well, I mean, bro.  He did go to Harvard, so...  Did he even lax for them?  You're talking about boar-nanky, right?  No way.  Yeah, man, we gotta wrap this jam sesh up, though.  You got anything else you want to say?  Nah, dude.  You want to give any shout-outs or something?  I don't know. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, sure.  I want to give a shout-out to my bro, Foley.  Nice raw dog man.  Shredder, keep shredding.  And, uh, Chatty, keep your DPS up, bro.  All right, we're out.  Later, bros.  Later, bros.  I'm just angry.  What's wrong?  I'm just angry.  I had them...  Shut up, Zs.  Jesus Christ.  What the...  Uh...  Like, as an SNL parody, it might work if they picked a different topic than the world economy. 
[03:35:00]  I thought it was a good way to get the news.  We don't oftentimes cover that news on the O&A show, so I thought...  Shut up.  Shit.  There was bro reason for that.  Holy God.  Someone dig up Scott Muni.  There should have been two gunshots partway through.  So, well, Pierce wanted to do something after the Dick Insider didn't work for him.  Well, it certainly didn't.  So, this is his original concept with Simple Mike, who quit.  So, who's... 
[03:35:30]  Wait, Pierce came up with this?  Pierce and Simple Mike together put their brains together and came up with bro chill.  News for bros by bros.  Matt M simply writes, he's from New Hampshire, he quit?  Why wasn't he fired?  How about he stops with the word play?  He's not good at it.  All right.  So, that was it for Simple Mike.  That was his last bit.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana brone. 
[03:36:00]  These are funnier than the bit.  That's his grand hurrah.  People are requesting the Twisted Sister song again.  Oh, wow.  They're saying we could bring it back with the...  What was it?  That dumb song?  It's...  It's the 30 and 30.  I'm back 30 and...  30.  30 forever.  What the hell was it called?  So, you've got Simple Mike on the way out?  A little backstage with Simple Mike?  Well, I mean, I covered the news.  He was gone already.  Oh, so you don't get Simple Mike in the backstage with O&A Simple Mike quits bit? 
[03:36:30]  Well, I wasn't going to call him because once he's done, he's done.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and it's been weeks since we heard from king of the Opie and Anthony interns, executive intern, Simple Mike.  We went into the O&A intern office to find out how he's been doing.  Hey, Simple Mike.  Simple Mike?  Steve, where's Simple Mike?  He's not with us anymore, Sam. 
[03:37:00]  Simple Mike is dead?  Oh, uh...  Steve is the worst actor.  It drives me fucking nuts.  He really is bad.  Just be Steve.  Just have a conversation with Mike.  Yes, yes.  Sam's got his, you know, backstage bit, whatever.  He's hacking it up a little bit.  Just be Steve.  Your whole job is to give a little info.  He's so bad.  I hate hearing his...  How did your parents die?  Listen again to Steve. 
[03:37:30]  Hey, Simple Mike.  Simple Mike?  Steve, where's Simple Mike?  He's not with us anymore, Sam.  Simple Mike is dead?  Oh, no, he quit.  Simple Mike...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.  It's that slight, natural stammering.  Oh, yeah, but Joe.  Because he quit.  Steve only thinks of one line at a time.  He doesn't think where the line might lead. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, it's supposed to be a natural delivery.  Most people don't just talk like this.  Sometimes they stutter a bit or grasp for an idea by perhaps doing that.  I do it all the time.  No.  No.  Oh, fuck, is he bad.  Holy shit.  I gotta hear that now again.  Steve, where's Simple Mike? 
[03:38:30]  He's not with us anymore, Sam.  Simple Mike is dead?  Oh, no, he quit.  Simple Mike really quit?  Yeah, he did yesterday.  Why?  Scheduling conflict.  What was he doing at 4.30 in the morning that he couldn't make it in three days a week?  Making up bullshit excuses as to why he didn't want to be here anymore.  That's right, everyone.  Simple Mike is officially no longer a part of the Opie and Anthony show.  Gone in the way of all the other one-bit wonders whose names we can't remember. 
[03:39:00]  We went to Club Soda Kenny and the Opie and Anthony interns to get their thoughts.  Kenny.  Yes?  Did you hear about Simple Mike?  He quit his internship.  I wouldn't care if that kid didn't see 10 o'clock this morning.  But aren't you going to miss him?  Him quitting just proves what a selfish, conceited cocksucker he is.  Fat Matt the Angry Intern.  Did you hear Simple Mike is no longer interning for the...  You think Matt's the Angry Intern? 
[03:39:30]  I hate to keep stopping the bit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, watch out.  He's a loose cannon.  A loose cannon.  What do you think?  Oh, look out, folks.  Here it comes.  Stop in.  Is he going to say something outrageous?  He's so mad.  What is he mad about?  We need to know.  Did you hear Simple Mike is no longer interning for the show?  No.  He's gone? 
[03:40:00]  No.  Are you upset?  No.  But Matt, he was the executive intern.  Yeah.  What are you going to do now?  Who's going to lead the pack?  I'll fucking do it.  Intern Evan.  Intern Evan.  Hey, Sam.  Did you hear the news?  Simple Mike quit.  I heard.  I don't know any detail.  Does Evan ponder here?  Evan's good at pondering.  Pondering nonsense.  I don't know any details.  How are you coping?  I feel.  I told you.  I told you. 
[03:40:30]  Sam, did I hear this bit ahead of time?  No, not at all.  He's pondering.  He always ponders.  And then what comes out is like, it's just nonsense.  That's his Steve C. device.  Like, that's his thinking of the next line thing.  But he always uses words incorrectly.  Instead of just, Evan ponders and then you think, okay, here comes something deep and  it's the most, like, shallow nonsense ever.  But the delivery, but the delivery is, he's really.  Pure ponder.  Yes, it's fully behind it. 
[03:41:00]  It's deep.  Yeah.  How are you coping?  I feel.  I can't explain it, but I do feel happier and more relieved.  He's never coming back.  There's no fucking deepness to that state.  You, you, and you're pondering.  But you set it up, like.  Hi, Evan.  I try to use my, uh.  What are you saying, guys?  I try to use my.  I think carefully about them.  Yeah?  Yeah, especially in this, uh, type of forum.  Type of forum. 
[03:41:30]  It's the phrase you get after thinking carefully.  Everything is a ponder with Evan.  Yeah, I tend to overthink a lot, which causes me to use.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You are a fucking pisser.  Well.  I have no, uh, intentions on, uh, following my on-air aspirations.  So, uh.  No, huh?  I've been doing the best I can. 
[03:42:00]  Uh.  All right, let me get back to this.  Thank you, Evan.  We're coming back.  It's great.  Who's going to lead the interns?  Well, I have been, and will continue to lead the interns.  What about Fat Matt the Angry intern?  He's a good, uh, uh, supplementary, uh, role.  Supplementary.  Oh, okay.  What's going to happen next with these O&A interns?  And more importantly, who the hell cares?  No one, but Backstage will be there to cover it.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with O&A. 
[03:42:30]  And people are saying, can he rules?  Oh, yeah.  And, and, and I guess, because you said that was Pierce's bit who stole Dick Insider?  Yes, that's correct.  Someone is saying that that bit's stolen, too.  There's a bit online called...  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, bro rape.  Rape?  The link is in, on Instant Feedback, if you want to find it, Dan.  About 10 down.  Oh, boy.  So he might have ripped off this bit as well.  Another bit?  Although the bro thing, you know, it's been done many different ways. 
[03:43:00]  Exactly.  So why would you do it again?  Right.  Oh, God.  Someone is requesting frozen ravioli.  That's Matt Nichols.  Uh, why can't you just highlight the whole thing?  It doesn't work.  I don't know why.  It's the form.  I don't know.  Isn't that fucked up?  What, the noise?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  See.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, see, that's... 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Maybe...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Bro, this party's awesome, bro.  Yeah, dude.  I got some scotch.  You want to drink some scotch before the party?  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, let's do it, bro.  You can't because you want to hide it before anybody else sees it, okay, bro?  All right, bro.  I'm going to take your pants off, okay?  Wait, what?  Bro, this is going to be awesome, bro.  No, no, no, dude.  Go take my pants off.  All right.  All right, dude.  Go lay down on the bed.  No, no, no, bro. 
[03:44:00]  I'm not going to lay down on the bed.  Bro, go lay down on the bed.  No, this is going to be awesome, yo.  Just go.  There you go, bro.  All right, cool.  All right, bro.  Yo, this is going to be sweet, all right?  Wish me luck.  No, bro.  Bro, you go.  Bro, stop me.  It's a type of rape that's gone overlooked for decades, and it's risen 44% in the last year.  I'm talking, of course, about bro rape.  What is a bro?  A bro's an 18 to 24-year-old man who wears Birkenstock sandals, watches family guy, plays 
[03:44:30]  Old Smith Frisbee, and wears an upside-down visor or a baseball cap with a pre-frayed brim.  You know, a bro.  For every suburban house party, four bros will be raped, and only one in seven bros  will tell their boys what happened the next day.  Holy shit.  As a result, most bro rapes go unreported.  So it was my friend Jake's birthday party, and we're playing paintball and whatever, and  we go back to Tim's house to get a little drunk, and Tim brings out some beers, and I  turn around to get my bottle opener. 
[03:45:00]  When I turn back around, there's a Jack Johnson album next to my beer.  And I was like, whose is this?  I love Jack Johnson.  And Tim's like, oh, me too.  I love him too.  Let's go up to my room and talk about it.  Internet chat rooms for bands like Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, and Incubus have proven to be  a hotbed for bro predators looking...  It's not the same as bro, Jack.  All right.  Well, I guess...  Do you want to continue?  No.  Not for another eight minutes.  No, it's horrible.  I know.  I was wishing there would be more than that. 
[03:45:30]  I mean, eight minutes probably isn't enough time to get the whole bro concept.  Yeah, yeah.  Got that right, bro.  You got that right.  We get it.  We get it in the first, like, minute.  Yeah, but are they talking about, like, what's going on in the world economy and stuff like  that?  No, that was pretty good.  Yeah.  Joan Rivers looks fucking bizarre.  I'm sorry.  She looks fucking bizarre.  How you doing?  Is that our catchphrase?  Oh, Wendy Williams.  Do a montage before doing how you do it. 
[03:46:00]  Me, Wendy Williams.  I'd rather be bro-ranked.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  How you doing?  Is that what she says?  That's her thing, right?  Yeah.  How are you doing?  Joan Rivers.  No one, when it gets creepy with these women that get too many facelifts, I hate to say  it, Sharon Osbourne, she's on America's Got Talent, she went too far.  And it really is noticeable when they try to smile. 
[03:46:30]  What's that about?  Yeah.  Their mouth, because all the nerve endings and muscles are all fucked up and in the wrong  spots now.  Yeah.  So they smile and their nostrils flare.  It doesn't even fucking, their face muscles just don't even work anymore.  I try to blink and my ears wiggle.  We done?  Yeah, I'd say we're done.  Thanks a lot, Sam.  That's how it works.  We were having a good one before you brought the simple mic thing.  Yes.  You didn't like, which one did you like better, my backstage or bro-cho? 
[03:47:00]  Your backstage was good because Kenny pretty much saved that.  But I fed him, I set him up.  Oh, what?  You know, you gotta, you can't let the guy get a little credit?  I just was sharing it.  By the way, we got a, we got a sponsor for the big suicide show.  So psyched.  Yeah?  Who's killing themselves?  You, a week from Friday.  I'm not killing everything, so.  Who's the sponsor?  Have you decided how you're gonna do it?  I'm not doing it.  Have to.  Yeah, I have to.  Says who? 
[03:47:30]  No, you can't.  Says who?  Well, you're just gonna go says who?  Well, I was thinking, because that's like, you're now going on the cusp of-  You're fucking primetime Sam Roberts.  You're supposed to rock a mic.  I am trying to, but this is like legalities and things.  This would be like-  And how are we supposed to respond to says who?  I mean-  Well, I did, Sam.  Says who?  That's what he said.  How do we answer that?  This seems like an illegal-  Just kill yourself.  A week from Friday, that's all.  That's all you need to know.  I've got a lot to live for.  We ran it past the legal.  They said fine.  They did, yes.  Yeah, they actually agreed that you should kill yourself. 
[03:48:00]  I say you bleed out.  That'd be nice.  That would rock.  It's a longer death, so we'll get like some TSL.  Yeah.  And you just get weaker and weaker as the morning goes on.  I'm not doing that.  And then finally you just, you know, drop dead.  But before you get too weak, you've got to throw yourself out the window.  I'm not doing anything.  Because at that point, you know you're going to die, so you might as well.  Total weakness, and then you're just pulling yourself with the last bit of energy out the window.  Yeah.  If I was bleeding out, I would jump out a window, but I won't bleed out. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, so you're considering that.  That's good.  If I was bleeding out, but I'm not going to be, so.  I'm sure you're not.  All right, so maybe the bro bit sounds like me, circa WNAW.  All right, Tom Tippy from Atlanta.  We'll end with this.  Go fuck yourselves.  Ladies and gentlemen, fresh from their recent string of shows in Vienna, presenting the Seth Rogen Tabernacle Choir.  We'll end with this. </pre>
