<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  The show began with promotion for comedian Jackie Martling's upcoming performance at F.H. Riley's, following by an extensive discussion of Larry King's infidelity, fueled by a previous blind item on the show and commentary from a Little League coach.  They briefly touched upon the upcoming Uriah Faber/Jose Aldo UFC fight and Dana White's opinion of *Kick-Ass*.  A substantial portion focused on critical analysis of *Celebrity Rehab* and *Sober House*,  lambasting Dr. Drew's methods and detailing the post-show behavior of various participants, particularly Mary Carey's creation of *Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw*, and a heated confrontation between house mom "Jen" and Mike Starr.  Other planned guests were mentioned, including Ian Halperin, who had predicted Larry King's infidelity.

The show then segued into a discussion of a blind item about a TV host's infidelity, strongly hinting at Larry King.  This transitioned into a discussion of a New York Yankees triple play, interspersed with banter about other sports teams.  Jimmy Norton joined the show in studio during this segment. A viral video mocking Obama voters was played, leading to a highly offensive and inflammatory discussion about welfare recipients and their perceived irresponsibility, with specific mentions of a website containing extreme racial slurs and a news article about a woman with thirteen children.  The hosts expressed anger at Mayor Bloomberg's actions, including his pursuit of a third term and alleged tax avoidance, and criticized a proposed pedestrian mall project.  The discussion returned repeatedly to welfare reform, including offensive suggestions for reform.  Jim Norton recounted a Twitter incident where he was accused of racism, sparking a discussion about political correctness and online harassment.  They debated McDonald's marketing seemingly targeted at the Black community, and criticized a Broadview Security commercial for its lack of diversity.  Chris Hansen's work highlighting Detroit's liquor store to supermarket ratio was also discussed.

Jackie Martling then called in, promoting his show and sharing anecdotes, including jokes and stories about his career and encounters with other comedians.  He discussed the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and changes in attitudes toward drinking and driving, as well as recounting numerous instances of drunk drivers crashing into his home as a child.  The hosts also played a remixed version of their "Best Cry Ever" audio combined with a Popeye's chicken shortage news report, referencing TheTedWilliamsHead.com.  Larry King's statement endorsing Sarah Palin posing for Playboy and the subsequent backlash were discussed, along with offensive jokes about King and the women involved.  A heated debate ensued with a caller, Khalid from Minnesota, regarding the South Park Muhammad episode censorship and the hosts' generalizations about Muslims.

Another segment included discussions about the Yankees,  speculation about Sandra Bullock's marital status and potential dangers, and a phone call with UFC president Dana White, who discussed *Kick-Ass*, Pinkberry, Anderson Silva, the Faber/Aldo fight, and his dissatisfaction with a Strikeforce brawl.  Mary Carey joined the show in studio to discuss her experiences on *Celebrity Rehab* and *Sober House*, her opinions of Dr. Drew, her sobriety struggles, her marriage, and details of past sexual encounters, including those with Lexi Tyler and her opinion of Tawny Roberts.

In a further segment with Mary Carey, she recounted a recent encounter with a man she met through Brittany Skye, followed by explicit commentary about Mariah Carey's weight and crude jokes about her personal life.  Carey shared stories about her relationships, the challenges of being a woman in the pornography industry, including issues of pay and societal perceptions.  A male caller, Mario, discussed his relationship with his adult film actress wife.  They also discussed the legal cases of Max Hardcore and Steven Staliano.  The segment concluded with Mary Carey promoting her website and Twitter, and scheduling a future meeting with the hosts.  Finally, Ian Halperin joined the show again, discussing his blind item about Larry King's infidelity and teasing another about a New York Yankees player dating a Playboy model and cheating on her with a porn star, but declined to name the player.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  There's no ratings here, no one cares.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Sure is a negative sounding intro, but I like it.  Well, this is the last part.  Yeah.  No one cares.  The rest of the intro made perfect sense to me.  Of course it did.  There's no ratings here, no one cares.  Yeah, I don't even, yeah.  No one watches us, no one gets in our hair.  We're in daycare.  We're in daycare.  We're in daycare. 
[00:00:30]  We have half-day daycare.  Hey, I like that.  The a.m. session.  The a.m. session of daycare.  Good morning, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  What is it, guest day?  Apparently so.  We got Jackie Martling calling.  Yes.  Jackie Martling wrote me last night.  And this guy knows how to plug, Anthony, and I'll tell you why.  Of course he does.  Jackie Martling goes, hey, I got a gig in Dix Hills tonight.  Wait.  I wish I had the plug to give it a proper plug. 
[00:01:00]  He goes, and then after the show, I'm bringing everyone to FH Riley's.  So then I'm like, you son of a bitch.  Now I got to talk about Jackie Martling on the radio show.  Now he got your...  He knows how to freaking...  Push your buttons.  Yeah, get my attention.  So according to Jackie Martling, he does this show in Dix Hills tonight.  And then he's bringing the whole crowd over to FH Riley's, my brother's restaurant in the heart of Huntington Village.  For milk and cookies.  400 New York Avenue.  Yeah, he's doing the Andy Kaufman thing.  But we'll do it with, I don't know, spring rolls. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  Buffalo spring rolls or something.  Those are so tasty.  So Jackie Martling's calling in today.  Ian Halperin.  Yes, Ian has a few things, I guess, to get to.  Larry King is going to talk about.  Sandra Bullock.  Something about Craigslist.  David Hasselhoff.  Well, the Larry...  Another blind item.  Well, the Larry King was a blind item, he's now telling us.  Yeah.  And who said he's like Kreskin?  Somebody on staff said he's like Kreskin.  I believe he rocked.  His talking points for this week, Larry King, I predicted cheating in his marriage three weeks ago in a blind item on your show. 
[00:02:00]  And that's when he said something about someone cheating.  But now you could just say that and wait for someone to cheat because it's kind of the, you know, thing to do these days is to out cheaters.  So he could just say it's somebody famous that's cheating and then when they cheat he could go, I said that, Google it, Google it, I said it.  I think he said a...  Ask Jim Norton.  I think he said a TV host is cheating with a much younger woman. 
[00:02:30]  He did say...  But I want to get the actual clip.  Yeah, I want to hear the quote.  Because it'll be obvious if it's Larry King or not.  Exactly.  And then he goes, will he reconcile?  Does he need sex rehab?  Does he need sex rehab?  Larry King.  I have to go to sex rehab.  I got a sex problem.  They make me make my own bed and clean my toilets and then go to therapy.  Does he need sex rehab and how many lovers on the side does his wife have?  Lover.  Well, apparently, according to that Little League coach and his statements yesterday, she's quite a hose bag. 
[00:03:00]  Like, she picked him up.  Like that?  That lickety split.  Like that, yeah.  Yeah.  I think we might have more audio from that guy.  Oh, good.  He's such an upstanding fucking citizen.  Isn't he wonderful?  What a guy.  I think he did some more interviews on Entertainment Tonight because he's making the rounds.  Well, no, Entertainment Tonight has the exclusive, but what they do is they only give you a piece of the interview every day.  All right.  They string you along for an entire week. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know how our listeners get mad if we string them along for an hour?  Well, fuck, Entertainment Tonight does it for a week.  Week and a half.  So we got Ian Halpern calling today.  Then we got Dana White because we got that big fight.  Uriah Faber and Aldo fighting tomorrow night on pay-per-view.  Yeah.  The WEC thing.  Yup.  So we'll talk to Dana.  He tweeted last night that he went and saw Kick-Ass.  Oh, yeah.  And he liked it.  He liked it.  Or is it Kick-Ass?  It's Kick-Ass.  Kick.  Kick-Ass.  Kick-Ass.  He thought it was great.  It's good. 
[00:04:00]  I just think it could have had a little more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I said, the scenes with the kid just fucking shit up is great.  But it's not the whole movie.  Right.  They need more, yeah, more ass kicking would have been nice.  And then 9.30 today, an old friend, Mary Carey.  Yes.  Is coming in.  She's coming in.  What is she up to these days?  I think she's just continuing with her life.  Yeah?  I think she's doing some dancing over the weekend. 
[00:04:30]  She's always poking her ample breasts into the news in some way, shape, or form.  But you know how we talk about celebrity rehab and we're not sure about Dr. Drew?  Well, she was on celebrity rehab.  Oh, good.  Then we can ask her about it.  And Dr. Drew, you know, got some issues with her and she wasn't going to be partying anymore.  Oh, okay.  And she liked ballet growing up.  Well, she's got a ballerina body. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  What?  On Jupiter.  Where's Sam?  Because he saw this fucking celebrity rehab of Mary Carey.  And it looked like she was changing her life, Anthony.  She was turning her life around.  She was turning her life around.  She was...  That's the biggest statement, by the way, on First 48.  What?  The crime show where they murder, somebody's murdered and they try to find...  The person that's murdered is always involved in some kind of drug dealing.  And then when they go to the mama to inform her that the guy is dead, mama will always say, 
[00:05:30]  He was just turning his life around with his eight kids and his baby mama.  Yeah.  And it's like, no, he wasn't.  He was shot during a cocaine deal.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's like, he was not turning his life around.  He was talking about going to school.  The timing is always...  The timing is always awful, right?  It's terrible.  Just when they were turning their life around.  Turning their life around.  What was he doing?  They got caught in a big fucking drug bust.  He wasn't selling as much cocaine. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  He had good intentions.  Of course he did.  Where's Sam?  Because he knows about Mary Carey.  Cam.  So she was trying to get off the drugs and the booze.  Yeah.  And she was going to leave the porn thing behind her.  And she was going to maybe go back to her first love, which I think was ballet.  And even on Celebrity Rehab and Sober House, they showed her kind of like...  Oh, no, she wasn't.  ...kind of like dancing and stuff.  And she was tormented.  But she thought she could give it a good shot. 
[00:06:30]  Do...  I think a lot of girls realize ballet is for waifs.  Very skinny, small-breasted, small-framed girls do ballet.  Right.  Uh, she could put the Viking hat on and do some opera if she wants to, you know, get  some fucking braids sticking out of there and do that.  That stupid Viking hat.  I'm not bashing her, but I'm just saying, fucking ballet is a little, you know, we'd  all like to, hey, I'd like to be a fighter pilot. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  Uh, a little past my prime.  Right.  Well, I hope she opens up about the Celebrity Rehab and what it really is about because  it turns out, I can't find Sam because he knew a little more about this than me, but  I guess after she left Celebrity Rehab and Sober House, she made a go of it for a couple  weeks and then made a porn-mocking Celebrity Rehab.  Yeah, you go.  What'd she call it?  Right back to the well.  Yeah.  Uh, it was called Celebrity Porn Hab with Dr. Screw.  Just totally mocking what Dr. Drew was trying to accomplish. 
[00:07:30]  Great title, by the way.  Right.  I must say, when you get the parody titles, that's pretty good.  So, we'll find out about her experience with Dr. Drew and Celebrity Rehab and that fantastic.  Where's that Jackie plug?  I saw you popped it up there.  Jackie!  The Adventures of Jackie Martling, the Dix Hills Performing Arts Center, Five Towns College,  Dix Hills, New York.  Uh, no one's gonna write down the phone number right now, so, but he's performing tonight. 
[00:08:00]  And then supposedly, supposedly bringing everyone to F.H. Reilly.  Yeah.  I better give my brother the heads up.  Yeah, he better.  But every time a celebrity says they're going to F.H. Reilly's, they never show.  They don't show?  No.  What happened?  What's her name?  Victoria Gotti never showed.  Oh, right.  She said she was going, well, maybe you don't want to, you know, Spark Steakhouse East, you  know, you don't want a place to become notorious.  That's true.  Did you see the video that someone sent me and you last night? 
[00:08:30]  No, I did not see this.  Sam, real fast.  I guess so.  Just to wrap up to Mary Carey.  Then we'll get to the video in a second.  Yeah, I can't wait to see it.  I'm, um, Sam.  I'm all curious.  Did I get all the info right on Mary Carey?  She was on Celebrity Rehab.  She was trying to turn her life around.  Dr. Drew was getting to her.  She was, she was going to, uh, turn her life around and stop drinking and, and doing drugs.  Yeah, no, no more drinking, no more pills.  She was going to start learning, like, ballet because her real passion was always dancing from the  time she was a girl. 
[00:09:00]  She was never good at it.  Ballet doesn't usually have a pole.  No.  In the middle of the stage when they're doing, you know, the nutcracker.  Wait, how do I do a spin without a pole?  Yeah, what is that?  How do I, but I'm dancing.  Where's the pole?  No, this is ballet.  It's different dancing.  Yes, it's ballet.  It's, oh.  And they showed her giving up, like, the porno lifestyle and she was wearing, she was  wearing spandex, like, dancing stuff, but it was sensible stuff, like long tights  and things that covered everything up.  Is she going to go into the tuxedo-clad audience and, uh, do lap dances and try to get dollars 
[00:09:30]  put in her tutu?  Is that what, uh, she's coming for?  I think at the time she was thinking she'd sober up and move away from that area altogether.  Well, okay.  Yeah.  Sounds great.  So, what happened?  Well, she was, uh, she was in celebrity rehab.  I think she was in sober house.  She did sober house.  Yes, I thought.  And so, you know, she did her graduation and everything.  And she was a new Mary Carey.  Dr. Drew has a, uh, has a graduation ceremony.  And what does the graduation entail? 
[00:10:00]  It's...  If they could stand up and hold their diploma for three seconds.  Well, graduation is fun because, not that it's just for TV or anything, but that's when  all the celebrity rehab people announce whether or not they'll be in the sober house.  Oh, okay.  Which means they continue their treatment.  They get pushed on to another reality show.  Right.  Okay.  With cameras.  And see, unfortunately, you don't watch Celebrity Rehab and Sober House, but what you find  out, uh, when they say, yes, I'll go to Sober House, that in between Celebrity Rehab, the 
[00:10:30]  filming of Celebrity Rehab and Sober House, just about all of them are back on drugs and  alcohol.  Or their sex addiction, whatever the hell they're into.  Go figure.  A reality show, uh, based rehab thing, uh, in front of, uh, uh, the American public doesn't  work.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then, uh, I'm watching the latest, uh, season of Sober House.  They're, they're there for 30, uh, 30, three weeks, Ant.  20 to 21 days.  That's it.  Yeah.  And the Sober House, that's it. 
[00:11:00]  And then they move them on.  Well, because, you know, no one has time to film a reality show properly anymore.  Get back out to Drunken House.  Right.  And then they move back into their regular houses with the drug dealers knocking on their  doors.  And they're back, they're, nothing gets accomplished with these shows.  They're evolving, uh, if you kept them in the Sober House longer than three weeks, then  the camera crew wouldn't be prepared to film the next season of Celebrity Rehab.  Right.  So you have to end it.  Yeah, they're just knocking these out.  So.  Hey, we, we've discussed it on the show.  I mean, we, we come from an era where reality shows took six months to film. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Now they take three weeks.  Right.  Four weeks.  You gotta pump out some more seasons.  Jersey Shore was a six week fucking show.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They call it the summer at the Jersey Shore, but they were there for half a summer.  Half a summer.  Well, cause.  Just enough, uh, to get some shenanigans.  Yeah, just enough to get someone punched in the face.  Right.  Get a chick punched.  Someone puking and a girl topless and they got enough for a reality show.  If you get people who are unconventionally good looking and then combine them with alcohol 
[00:12:00]  and hot tubs, you can pump out a lot more in three weeks than you need.  Exactly.  Than you wouldn't, you know, six months.  Well, you know, Dr. Drew's just helping.  Yeah, exactly.  He is helping.  That's why.  And that's the important thing, isn't it, Opie?  That Dr. Drew is out there and it doesn't have anything to do with money or getting your  face out there as far as the popularity of a television show being on a television show.  He doesn't care about that.  No.  It's, he would do this behind closed doors for no money.  It's merely coincidental that he's all over the TV show. 
[00:12:30]  It's that it's just, you know, it just happened that the show coincided with his helping of  the people.  He's sitting there in the office meetings where he's trying to help them.  Oh, I guess I got to let the cameras in.  It's only fair.  Put the cameras in because this is really best for the people is to really fucking put them  on TV and let everyone see.  Well, what's great, they have the final episode of Sober House and they did some previews in  it.  Yeah.  Mike Starr is one of the guys.  He is tormented.  He's trying to get off heroin.  He used to party with Lane Staley. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, that's probably a pretty big party, yeah.  And Mike Starr, if you don't know, was the bass player of Alice in Chains, right?  Very angry.  So he's been in celebrity rehab and now Sober House and he's tormented.  He is trying to get off all the shit, but he's having a really tough time, right?  So the final episode of Sober House, Dr. Drew decides it's a good idea to kind of put  a kind of concert together and Mike Starr, a talent show, a talent show type of thing. 
[00:13:30]  And Mike Starr now has to go on stage and play a guitar.  So now they show a scene where he's backstage like, oh, Dr. Drew, I need my meds.  I can't do this.  Oh, shit.  Well, it's not like playing in a band will take him back to a place where he was heavily  using drugs.  That's exactly what I'm getting at.  What a lump of shit, Dr. Drew.  I think if you have a final episode where you're having a dumb little picnic at a beach or something,  it's not going to bring him back to the times when him and Lane Staley were trying to cop 
[00:14:00]  after an Alice in Chains show.  Yeah.  On the show, you could tell that Mike Starr, he's the type of person that needs to go to  a real rehab center.  He wants to get better.  He would do well, but what's not letting him get better is the frustration of 14 cameras  in his face at all times.  He's gotten into fights with cameramen.  He can't stay on the cameras.  Yeah.  If he can't stay on the cameras, perhaps he doesn't belong in that environment.  He needs real help.  They kicked him out because he kind of punched or hit a camera guy, mostly just pushing the 
[00:14:30]  camera all the way, because he can't, like Sam said, he can't take cameras in his face,  so he shouldn't even be on the show.  Right.  Especially while he's detoxing.  And then, so, he pushes a cameraman or the camera violently, so now they're like, oh,  you can't be here anymore.  You're crazy.  You're crazy.  You can't be here.  But I need help.  That's like, but, that's what I thought I was here for, doctor.  If we can't guarantee the security of our medical staff and also the television crew. 
[00:15:00]  The cameramen are very much more important than your sobriety and helping you.  Right, right.  All right, let's go to Rick in New Orleans.  Rick.  Hey, good morning.  Hey, Rick.  What's up, Rick?  I noticed Swifty Benzer got his last chance from Dr. Drew.  He was messing up real bad, but instead of going through detox, they put him straight in  the sober house. 
[00:15:30]  Well, you want to explain Swifty to Anthony?  Yeah, he was the star of the first season of Celebrity Rehab.  I mean, and then, then season two, he made a cameo, smoking crack on the roof of the  house.  So obviously the first season.  Well, let Christian Slater describe it.  Huh?  This guy.  Oh, yeah.  He said, yeah.  He do sound like him.  What the hell is that?  So Swifty makes a cameo, smoking crack on a roof, and then Dr. Drew's, did Dr. Drew 
[00:16:00]  climb up on the roof?  Yeah.  With the camera crew, Anthony.  Yeah, the camera crew.  Because that's how you help a guy out.  Dr. Drew gets a call that Swifty is on a, on a roof, smoking crack, might jump off the  roof.  So Dr. Drew, you know, runs over there with the camera crew and gets the camera crew in  tow.  He probably had to tell him, hold on.  You know, you don't, I'm sure Dr. Drew doesn't have the camera crew with him at all  times.  Right.  So he had to take time out, make the guy wait until he got the camera crew all together. 
[00:16:30]  And you know how fast you could get camera crews and, and, and sound people together.  Proving your point that filming the TV show just as, if not more, more important than  actually helping the, than the players.  Because if that guy jumps.  He calls out Dr. Drew on a, on a, so then Swifty, uh, goes away, whatever.  And then Sober House is all about, well, these guys are off drugs for a little while, right?  Yeah.  Swifty calls Dr. Drew again and they're at a burger place or some fucking place.  And he's just strung the fuck out. 
[00:17:00]  It's like, I finally have hit my bottom and I'm ready to surrender to this Dr. Drew.  So, so Dr. Drew goes, all right, yeah, we'll, we'll throw you right into the Sober House.  Right.  Holy shit.  Instead of rehabilitating you, we'll start to just, and, and I guess Shifty said, I've hit  my bottom.  Luckily, it's the same time that you're, whatever his name is.  Luckily, it's at the same time as you filming a television show.  Right.  Thank God.  Right.  So why do I do the rehab?  Let's do the post rehab.  Holy shit.  Sober House.  And the fun thing, since they're celebrities is you get to, you at home can track their 
[00:17:30]  progress after the show is done.  What?  I didn't know that.  Well, I mean, just watching what they do in their careers when they end up on TM.  Or what, what did Mary Carey do as soon as she left Sober House?  Well, I thought she, but she got on Sober.  Hold on.  She graduated though, Sam.  She graduated.  Don't they get a little plaque or something for surviving like three weeks or something?  She was rehabilitated.  And then she said she's leaving porn because porn is obviously a gateway back to the alcohol 
[00:18:00]  and pills and all that stuff.  Supposed to not really cohort with the people that were in the lifestyle that caused you  to, you know, have to seek medical attention by Dr. Drew, of course.  So then just a few months after the season ended, Mary Carey came out with a new film  called Celebrity Pornhub.  Celebrity Pornhub with Dr. Screw.  Yes.  Don't forget about Dr. Screw.  Isn't that a slap in the face to Dr. Drew? 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  Can we perhaps, is there any way we can see a little clip of what Dr. Screw looks like?  There it is.  Horny old Dr. Screw.  Oh my God.  We're looking at the cover right now.  It's Mary Carey.  She's dressed in some black leather nurse type outfit.  Look at her boobies.  Uh, with a, with a, an enema hanging from a, um, like an IV rack.  Yeah.  Uh, and she's squatting on Dr. Screw's lap. 
[00:19:00]  She's got a-  And Dr. Screw has the gray hair and the glasses looking very Dr. Screw-ish.  She's got kind of a dominatrix slash nurse outfit on.  Oh, is that a scene from Dr. Screw?  Nice.  Is that Dr. Screw fucking her?  But I thought she was trying to move on from this.  Well, not only is it a, it would be a slap in the face just to go back to porno because  it's like, look at your treatment meant nothing.  Right.  Not only did she do that, but she decided to parody the entire thing.  Right, right.  The entire experience.  Yeah.  Goof on everything she had been through. 
[00:19:30]  You and I both know, Dr. Drew, that this is a joke, so now I reinvent you as Dr. Screw.  Dr. Screw.  Were they playing, like, uh, nice mellow music when she, uh, when, when she graduates?  Like, what's the, what's the atmosphere during graduation?  Oh, a lot of tears, Anthony.  Tears and hugs.  And does Dr. Drew put on that face like that, yeah, yeah, you know, I think she's going  to make it.  Dr. Drew's great with that face where he looks and he nods and he's like, yeah, I think I've  really helped here.  It's a very emotional point because you, Dr. Drew's face, it goes from that pouty, like, 
[00:20:00]  yes, I feel your pain face to the, I'm so proud of you.  You're doing this.  You're really doing it.  It's almost a little smirk with a nod like, you did it.  Yeah.  You got this one, slugger.  You did it.  And then fast forward, I'm Dr. Screw.  What the hell happened?  Like Sam said, it meant nothing in the other thing.  Dr. Screw.  Then they got Heidi Fleiss in Sober House, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, she went through celebrity rehab, she stayed sober, she's in Sober House. 
[00:20:30]  She leaves Sober House for one day because she has a court appearance and comes back to  the house completely fucked up.  Just fucked up.  That's great.  That clickety-clack bitch.  Who called her that?  Wasn't that fucking Sizemore?  Called her clickety-clack bitch, bag of bones.  But Sizemore was on Larry King the other night and I guess he is staying sober.  I think he's close to a year sober.  Yeah, he said he's been sober for a year.  That's someone I would actually like to see sober up and get back in the fucking movies 
[00:21:00]  because, uh, god damn, he was good.  He was great, right?  He was good before he got all fucked up.  But maybe Dr. Drew will help him out.  I hope so.  Well, this is how Dr. Drew helps out Tom Sizemore.  He puts Tom Sizemore in the house with Heidi Fleiss and they have had a horrendous relationship.  It's a fucking snake and a mongoose putting them together and thinking they're going to, like, get along.  And everyone knows.  You don't even have to be, like, a fucking addiction specialist.  No.  Like, you don't want any conflicts when you're trying to get over your abuse, your problem. 
[00:21:30]  I would assume the biggest conflict is the problem.  Right.  So why throw monkey wrenches in there like a person you hate?  So she goes into the sober house with Tom Sizemore and there's fireworks immediately, Anthony,  and they fucking hate each other, causing Tom Sizemore to completely freak out.  And then Heidi Fleiss comes back from her court appearance all fucked up.  And now that is terms for, you know, getting kicked out of the sober house. 
[00:22:00]  Removal.  Oh, really?  Removal, right?  But Dr. Drew goes, no, she really needs to be here because it's great TV to see Heidi Fleiss and Tom Sizemore going at it,  which goes against, you know, what should be done here.  Look at Tom Sizemore.  Holy shit, he's got a mohawk.  Oh, my God, I thought it looks like him.  No, that's Celebrity Pornhab starring Penny Flame, who you may remember from Dr. Drew's sex addiction show.  Are you kidding?  No. 
[00:22:30]  Really?  Wait, so she did a parody too?  Actually, she's on Sober House right now.  Yes, she is.  That's her.  She's addicted to sex.  Oh, mother fucker.  What's her name?  Penny Flame?  Penny Flame.  Except you can't call her Penny Flame anymore.  Why?  What is she?  I forget her real name, but she's not going by that anymore because she's not in porn.  She's not a sex addict anymore.  But we're looking at porn.  Was this after the show?  It's just, it must have been before. 
[00:23:00]  But it's called Celebrity Pornhab.  She's kind of hot.  By the way, I just want to bring that up.  Maybe it was just really hot.  I just want to bring that up.  She's really fucking hot.  Hot.  But she's not like this anymore.  She graduated.  Oh, she did?  But it's a Celebrity Pornhab.  What is that based on?  Yeah, but if she graduated, this is made after, right?  Must have been before.  Looking at this scene right here, Anthony, it looks like she learned a lot from her sex  rehab time with Dr. Drew.  Holy fuck.  Dr. Drew really helped her out, huh? 
[00:23:30]  This, I, this girl's great.  She's on Sober House and, oh wow, she's all right, man.  You're not being conducive to her recovery.  No, I guess I'm not.  But let me tell, holy shit.  Did she learn that in sex rehab?  Yeah.  Sam?  No, she learned that that's not the right way to get attention.  Did she do that with her diploma in her mouth?  Was she able to actually deep throat her diploma like she is that cock?  Holy shit.  But I got an, I need to know, was this made after her time with Dr. Drew or not? 
[00:24:00]  It has to be if it's called Celebrity Pornhab.  Well, it was definitely made after Mary Carey's season, but it might have been made, it might  have been made before her season.  So, yeah.  But either way, she'll be making these movies in no time.  I hear some dialogue.  Hmm.  I think she's going through withdrawal right now.  Oh, where's Dr. Screw right now?  Well, she, this is a different film.  Oh, okay.  Dr. Screw should be in this too, though. 
[00:24:30]  They need help.  Is this one of the steps?  Yeah.  There's really not supposed to be any sexual activity in the rehab rooms.  I don't know why this is going on in Dr. Screw's rehab.  Jesus Christ.  She's a good egg.  Wow.  You'd think a nurse would hear that or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You'd think they wouldn't be able to do this, and they should be doing maybe chores.  Yeah, chores.  She's hotter than that.  Yeah.  She's even hotter than that.  They're supposed to clean their room. 
[00:25:00]  You know that, well, she's cleaning something else right now with her mouth.  It's dick.  Amazingly.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, oh, oh, what?  I'm going to just wash this shit forever.  I do, by the way.  Good for you.  I think I need to go to Dr. Drew and get some porn rehab.  That's nice.  Wow.  Or Dr. Screw.  Dr. Screw.  So, so Mary Carey will be in today.  Yeah.  That's, that's how we, uh, bring us back around.  Yeah, Mary Carey is, uh, coming in. 
[00:25:30]  And hopefully she'll be honest about her time in celebrity rehab and sober house and Dr.  Drew.  Is that there?  There's Dr. Screw.  What's he saying?  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  Shut up and watch.  You're not supposed to be doing this during rehab.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Dr. Screw is just looking over them, writing on a chart, leering. 
[00:26:00]  He's writing on a doctor's chart right next to them as they're fucking.  I don't know.  I feel like they're mocking Dr. Screw.  I think they are when they say, shut up, Doc.  This is different.  They're saying that to Dr. Screw.  Yeah, but we all know who that's supposed to represent.  Oh.  What is he writing down?  I don't know. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Get him fucking out.  Oh, oh, oh.  And Dr. Screw's getting right in there for the big money shot.  Oh, well, there we go.  Wow.  Yep.  Jesus Christ.  God damn porno, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Now, what does Dr. Screw have to say about that? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I don't think he'd be happy with that.  He's writing, he's writing feverishly.  No, that's really not going to help your rehab or your career.  Sniffy, I think I found your crack rock.  What?  Are you fucking serious?  Wait, wait.  Fucking crackhead.  Spits at him.  Worst doctor ever.  Worst doctor ever.  As she storms out of the room and he chases over this chart. 
[00:27:30]  This isn't good that they're all mocking him.  I'm starting to think.  He's just trying to help.  This is derogatory towards Dr. Drew, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm starting to think.  Holy shit.  Well, it's not like Mary Carey would join Celebrity Rehab just for attention.  It's not like she ran for governor in California just for attention.  She needed help.  Yes.  Dr. Drew, one of the premier doctors in this field.  I'm sure it didn't help her porno career at all.  Well, then.  No.  Anthony, if this is going well, we do have the last episode of Sober House where Jen, 
[00:28:00]  do you know anything about Jen?  I know nothing.  This is great, though.  I'm learning.  Jen's the house mom.  Now, what is the house mom's responsibility?  She's sober.  Uh-huh.  But she used to be one of them.  They always were.  She's not a professional.  She's not a professional, but she's in charge of the house, and she's got strict rules.  Strict rules?  And she spent the whole season kicking people out of Sober House.  Because nobody's listening to her.  Because she has a say to kick people out?  She's the one I thought Dr. Screw did it. 
[00:28:30]  Dr. Drew, sorry.  I got him confused.  Dr. Drew doesn't live in the Sober House.  Just Jen does.  Oh.  Who has no background or training.  She's just a crazy woman who used to be a drunk.  To deal with recovering addicts.  And she's one argument away from fucking going back to whatever she was into.  Oh, she wants that bottle.  Yeah.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical to present this as a doctor helping people.  It's like, why not do, instead of something like this, do like, have a doctor that perhaps 
[00:29:00]  at one point in his career was a brain surgeon.  And then bring a bunch of people in with brain tumors in a house.  And then have somebody there that had a brain tumor that was taken out successfully.  And they get to operate on people's brain tumors.  Yeah.  Not the doctor.  Yeah.  The doctor just kind of hangs out.  You don't think hanging out with Dennis Rodman and Heidi Fleiss would help you recover?  No.  Oh.  No.  I think that would probably be a bad thing.  A deterrent? 
[00:29:30]  Do they do group therapy?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Morning meditations.  You really got to watch Sober House.  And so let me get into this, because we've spent a lot of time on this.  Jen.  So Jen needs people to clean the kitchen and clean their room.  Yeah.  Like, they have chores in the Sober House.  And Mike Starr, the guy from Alice in Chains, who's trying to get off heroin.  Yeah.  All he does all day is he puts headphones on, listens to music.  He actually listens to himself.  He listens to Alice in Chains all day long.  Oh, that's not healthy.  Remembering the good times.  And he just paces, because he's out of his fucking mind trying to stay sober. 
[00:30:00]  And this Jen, who has no experience or training, gets in his face, because he's not cleaning  his fucking room.  Yeah.  It's like a mom would do to a seven-year-old.  So listen to this.  Actually, it starts...  This is the morning meditation, I think.  Oh, the morning meditation, where she scolds everyone for not cleaning up after they had  breakfast.  Kitchen should be clean.  Bathroom should be clean.  The chores need to be done.  And if the chores are not done, then you can leave. 
[00:30:30]  Bottom line.  Just leave.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  It's like everyone has...  Everyone's been handed a fucking silver platter with everything you can possibly have.  Your dreams have come true.  And you're spitting on it.  And you're whining over and over again.  And you have every fucking excuse.  And everything's about me, me, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, me, me. 
[00:31:00]  You know what?  That's what got you f***ing here.  Before you guys came here, you were in the dark.  Now you're...  We're trying to show you what the light looks like and you're spitting on it?  I'm sad for you guys.  Pray for us.  Pray for us.  Oh, God.  All of a sudden, one of the sex addicts girls goes, pray for us.  That was Penny Flame. 
[00:31:30]  We just saw an action.  That was Penny Flame?  Yeah.  Saying pray for us.  Yeah.  Pray for us.  Pray for us.  Tom Sizemore was the prick who was yawning while she was...  Right.  And Jen...  Oh, that was him yawning.  Okay.  And the house mom, Jen, who's sober, she spent the whole season going crazy.  Yeah.  Really?  Her eyes turned into cuckoo eyes by the end of the season.  So then, this is the confrontation with Mike Starr, who used to be in Alice in Chains,  who's just fucking pacing.  He's out of his fucking mind.  All he's thinking about is heroin.  What's going to do today? 
[00:32:00]  Did you clean your room?  Mike, you got to clean your room before you leave.  I keep asking you, bro.  You just won't do it.  I'm just going to do it later.  I don't feel good.  No, Mike, Mike, you got to do your chores.  I did my chore already.  Your chore is cleaning your room.  Look, I just don't feel good right now.  Mike, clean your room.  I can't right now.  No, yeah, you can.  Mike, this is not falling in direction.  This is a sober house to learn to live and transition into the next world. 
[00:32:30]  If someone's doing something for them and, like, babying them, they're not going to learn anything.  This is why it's horseshit, because even sober people don't clean their room.  No.  You know what I mean?  No, why?  That has nothing to do with addiction.  You know what I mean?  I guess it's...  You're either one of these people that like to keep your room nice and clean  and make your bed, or you don't.  I guess it's a discipline thing that in true recovery has a part, not in televised fake  recovery.  So to just hound him in front of cameras to clean his room looks very silly. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  And he knows that there are four cameras pointed at him, and some woman is just poking  at him in the face saying, clean your room, clean your room, taunting him, because the  cameras are rolling.  Yeah.  Well, that was just the beginning of the confrontation.  I'm going to do my chore later on today.  No.  You have to clean your room, Mike.  I can't do it this hour.  Yes, you can.  I'm asking you.  I can't do it right now.  Mike?  I need to...  I'm meditating right now.  No, you're not, Mike.  I need you, Mike.  I'm not kidding with you.  You're a little f***ing child. 
[00:33:30]  Go clean your room.  Go get...  Go clean your room.  Go...  Oh, see, Ann, I forgot to tell you.  She called him a f***ing child, which I don't think you learned that if you had proper training.  And also, she will not let it be.  Yeah.  She's now following him all over the house, and this is what you're hearing now.  Like, as opposed to saying, okay, take 10 minutes to cool off, and then clean your room. 
[00:34:00]  Or call Dr. Drew, one of the real professionals, how do I handle this?  No.  She's decided that I will get to him eventually.  She knows how to do this now.  Go clean your room.  Go clean your room.  Shut up.  You.  Things are so ugly.  That's okay.  My face is ugly, but I'm sober, and I can do the s*** that I need to do.  I know how to live life.  Just get out of my face.  I know how to live life.  I know how to live life.  Get out of my face.  I know how to live life.  Go clean your room.  Go clean your room. 
[00:34:30]  Look at your face.  Go clean your room.  Look at your face.  Go clean your room.  Look at your face.  Go clean your room.  Go look at your face.  Look at your face.  Look at your face.  Look at your face.  Clean your room.  Shut up, you dumb douchebag.  Go clean your room.  Go clean your room.  F*** you.  Go clean your room.  Go clean your room.  Right on.  Right on.  Don't touch me.  Give me a hug.  You touch me.  I'll f*** you call 911.  I'm not even f***ing kidding with you.  Go clean your room.  Go clean your room.  Now, Anthony, I know you don't have the proper training as far as dealing with addicts,  but do you think this approach is actually very positive and effective in the end? 
[00:35:00]  I got to tell you, not knowing anything about what it takes to have somebody in recovery  and successfully recover from their addictions, I would say that is the worst method possible.  You don't think standing nose to nose saying clean your room, clean your room,  to a recovering heroin addict is a good idea.  And then, yeah, with cameras rolling, of course, and threatening him with 911.  Yeah, right, right. 
[00:35:30]  No, no.  And having no experience, just throw some former drunk in there.  Right.  No, I don't see that as being a good thing.  Well, it didn't end there.  No, it's Dr. Drew.  I'm not f***ing around.  If you were a douchebag, I wouldn't clean my room.  Go clean your room.  This is rude.  That's rude.  This is your room.  Go clean your room.  Kick me out.  Kick me out.  Pack your s*** out.  Kick me out.  Pack your s***.  Get out.  Kick me out.  I'm kicking you out.  Go.  Go kick me out.  Get out.  Get out, Mike.  There's somebody who kicked me out.  No, I'm the someone that's kicking you out. 
[00:36:00]  Get the s*** out.  It's over.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.  Sure it is.  Watch out.  By the way.  You're such a s*** drama queen.  You're a liar, cheat, and a thief.  Go get your s*** out.  Go get your s*** out.  Shut up.  Enough with the abuse.  Get away from me.  Go fix your s*** and get out.  I ain't ever leaving.  Get your s*** and get out.  Shut up.  Or go clean your room now.  Shut up.  Go clean your room.  I'm standing on my ground with this whole house.  I do not care who they are or where they came from or how much money they have. 
[00:36:30]  I don't care what they do.  I just see them as addicts that are very sick and need help.  See, she's the one that's pretty sick and need help.  She's just a mental patient.  Just because she's sober doesn't mean she's not f***ing crazy.  Holy s***.  Isn't that amazing?  That's just not how you handle the situation.  You look like a pig.  You put it on the floor.  Pick it up.  Oh, shut up.  You're f***ing me.  No, Mike.  You're a f***ing pig. 
[00:37:00]  I know he's trying to get off heroin and he's an addict and all, but in the end, the  guy traveled the world with a house in chains, and you're telling the guy that he lives  like a pig and he needs to clean his room?  F*** you.  That's never going to resonate with him.  F*** you.  You look like a pig.  You put it on the floor.  Pick it up.  Oh, shut up.  You're f***ing me.  No, Mike.  You shut up.  I'm so tired of your BS baby whining, complaining. 
[00:37:30]  Shut up.  It's ridiculous.  I've had it up to here.  I'm not going to clean my room.  No, you're going to pack your s***.  I'm going to put everything in a trash bag and I'll kick it out.  Okay, do that.  Mike.  Do that.  Do that.  You don't want to f***ing lose this opportunity.  You have a few more days and you have been so difficult.  You are a grown man, not a child.  It's been two weeks and I've been great for a week.  She's training him like a child.  So don't just say that.  Mike, now you're not great.  So look, emotionally incapable.  If you don't.  Constitutionally incapable of being honest with yourself and growing up. 
[00:38:00]  I'm acting up, acting as if maybe you have potential to be a man and to get better.  You clean your room, Mike.  You gave me a reason to leave.  Clean your room.  Good.  Then you're leaving.  You can walk out.  No, I'm going to go do something.  No, go walk out, Mike.  I'm going to go do something.  If you're not cleaning your room, get the f*** out of here.  I'm going to go do something.  Get out.  Go.  Shush.  Hey, Jen, I'm going to go do something for a while.  I'll be back in a little while.  Go away.  You're giving me a problem.  Go away, Mike.  I was trying to clean my room, but you didn't let me.  No, you weren't trying to clean your room.  You were playing the whole time.  Get the f*** out.  No, I was trying to clean my room.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Goodbye, you're out. 
[00:38:30]  Shut up.  He's so f***ing with her.  He rules.  She's like, get out.  He's like, all right, I'll be back in a little bit.  No, you can't come back.  Yeah, I'll be right back.  Yeah, I got to go do something.  I'll be right back.  He's just f***ing with her.  Dennis Rodman f***ed with her pretty good, too.  Yeah, she goes.  At one point, he goes, I just want to see how mad you'll get.  Because she goes, now everybody has to give me their cell phones as punishment for missing  your curfew.  God, it hasn't seen any of this.  And then Dennis Rodman goes, no.  Dennis Rodman and one of the porn chicks or one of the sex addicts. 
[00:39:00]  It was Penny Flame.  It was Penny Flame.  They decide, you know, part of their treatment, they need to go to an L.A. club.  So they go to an L.A. club while they're living at a sober house, right?  Of course.  And their curfew was what, midnight?  I think it was 1 a.m.  1 a.m.  So they're mocking the curfew while they're still in the club, like, 1 a.m.  Yeah, right, whatever.  So they show up back up to the sober house, and there's Jen, this psycho bitch, right?  And all of a sudden, she goes, well, because these two were late, everyone loses their phone  privileges.  And now she's taking their cell phones. 
[00:39:30]  Could you imagine someone coming to you and going, Anthony, give me your cell phone?  Because somebody else stayed out late, no, I wouldn't either.  And the whole reason you become a rock star or a professional athlete or a celebrity is  because you don't want somebody telling you what to do in your job.  Yeah.  So she collected all the cell phones of these very famous addicted people.  But Dennis Rodman just looked at her, and he was like, no, I'm not going to give you  my phone.  No, I'm sorry.  You know what it is.  When cameras are going, and you've got people in front of cameras like that, both sides 
[00:40:00]  are just going to put on things.  Of course.  They're going to put on, like, she's doing that, clean your room, clean your room, because  the cameras are there.  And he's fucking with her and being an asshole because the cameras are there.  They have an audience.  It's called reality, but this isn't fucking reality.  Did you ever have a woman named Jen tell you to clean your room?  Certainly did.  Got fucking rid of that lickety split.  Well, nine years isn't quite lickety split, but yes, I did.  That would have been a good reality show. 
[00:40:30]  It was, oh my God.  Yeah, yeah, that would have been a great reality show.  Vacuum the room.  Vacuum the room.  Vacuum the room.  No, I'm going out.  I'll be back in the room.  Take out the garbage.  Take out the garbage.  Me or her.  Me or her.  Okay.  That would be the end of the show, by the way.  That would have been the end of the show.  That would have been Anthony's ultimatum.  And what a surprise he picked that one.  Are you saying?  Graduation day.  That was graduation day.  I graduated from the house.  Are you saying that wasn't the right choice to give you?  Not the, uh... 
[00:41:00]  If anybody knows anything about good old Anthony here, it's that he does not enjoy the ultimatum.  And will, 99% of the time, choose the one you do not want me to choose because you have given me an ultimatum.  Uh, this happens a lot.  Well, on what planet would have, would the me or her worked in her favor?  Exactly.  Especially how she was putting it to you.  You know what it was?  On the planet of a guy who would just go, all right. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Sure.  All right.  Or I don't want to go through a divorce.  I don't want to go through this, that.  So, yeah.  The ultimatum was me or her.  I couldn't have answered quickly enough.  All right, her.  I'm out of here.  Take it easy.  See you later.  Take care.  Have a good one.  All right.  And so the Jen, Mike Starr thing, you know, finally, Dr. Drew, the professional, how to take care of the problem.  And, um, sit her down.  He was sensitive and then watched the clips together.  Oh, that's good.  You missed the video where he decided to get on this bike and just kind of ride in circles while she was chasing him. 
[00:42:00]  Wow, she is a bruiser.  Yeah.  Plus her eyes start rolling in the back of her head when she gets crazy.  Hell yeah.  She's got a lot of horrible bodies like Miss Ballbreaker and Porky's.  Yeah.  I look forward to her, uh, her slip.  Oh, it's coming.  It's coming.  So Dr. Drew now has to talk to her in.  I'm scared for you right here.  I'm like amazed.  You're looking at the video and, uh, you know, there's a conversation that could have got very physical and that's what Dr. Drew is commenting on here. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, God, shut up.  I'm scared for you right here.  I'm like amazed that there's something that didn't really go bad.  You're not handicapped, Mike.  I'm scared for you.  I'm scared for him.  What?  Drama queen.  F***.  That's right.  I'm f***.  You don't ever want to use abusive language towards a patient?  Never.  No matter how bad they get.  For us, that's a, that would be a grounds for termination.  There's never grounds, ever, for using abusive language towards a patient. 
[00:43:00]  Ever.  There's a reason for that.  I mean, amongst that, it's your own safety.  The guy is, is in this condition, pacing, agitated, irritable.  Get out.  Don't get, don't be around it.  I just asked to clean his room in the beginning.  Oh, shut up.  Dr. Drew told you what to do.  I mean, I still don't see, I mean, I see a guy who, I'm, I'm impressed that he kept it together.  I'm grateful.  I would have loved to have seen his meaty fist just go right into her pig face. 
[00:43:30]  And it's driving her crazy, because she goes to see Dr. Drew to tell him how unreasonable Mike's being.  And Dr. Drew is saying, I'm very impressed with Mike's behavior.  Dr. Drew flipped it around on her, like, you shouldn't use abusive language, you should have just left the scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, clean you around, clean you around.  But again, the cameras are rolling, and they're all f***ing playing to it.  So, why does.  In his face, somebody intruding in his face.  Dr. Drew, he's been in my face and everyone else's face the whole entire time.  You're not a professional.  I don't expect you to know this stuff necessarily. 
[00:44:00]  Right?  Face.  Okay.  Face.  So, are you okay with all that?  No.  I'm not, you know.  And it's not this, you know.  I mean, everyone has, everyone's buttons get pushed.  It's been nonstop with Mike.  Howdy cleans right now.  Where is he down?  Yeah, I mean, I asked him to clean his room kindly over and over.  I've walked this guy through so much.  I've been so, every time he's abused me, I can only take so much. 
[00:44:30]  I understand that.  It's a tough one.  This is much more tough than the first time.  By far.  It's unrelenting.  It's so much abuse.  Blinding.  It's so much abuse.  Yeah, it is.  And, you know, I know you're in, you're in, involves a lot more and all this stuff.  But this process is wearing a one-sold.  Well, here's what I'd suggest.  I'd like to bring more manpower to the house.  Back you up.  What do you think about that?  They're bringing Louisa in.  So, you've got two of you in there. 
[00:45:00]  So, it's not all coming down on you this way.  Does that make me look like a weakling?  No.  We're adjusting to the needs of the community.  Yes.  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.  You can't handle these fucking guys.  Right.  So, they've got to bring some bouncers in.  We need actual professionals.  Yeah, maybe a professional.  To handle you.  Well, now that we've gotten great TV, we're going to bring in the actual professionals.  Yeah, we only got a week or two left.  A week?  They had less than a week when they brought in the backup. 
[00:45:30]  So, they had her in hell for two and a half weeks to get good TV.  And then they brought in the professionals to make sure no one punched anyone.  Yeah, we might have went a little long there.  But that sober house is fucking...  I can't get enough of it because it's all bullshit.  It's all just exploitive shit on the part of Dr. Drew and whatever production company is putting this drivel together.  But he wears a tie.  He's got the gray hair.  He's got the glasses.  He's a professional.  And he's professional.  He's got a stethoscope.  Yeah, he wears a stethoscope. 
[00:46:00]  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  Why?  Because he's a doctor.  But have you ever seen him tell somebody to breathe deep and put the stethoscope to them?  I figure it must be going on off the air.  He does not wear a stethoscope.  Yes, he does.  Why does he just wear those old-timey mirrors on his head?  Why would he be, like, checking someone's heartbeat or breathing?  In case he needs to do some of his doctoral duties.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Holy fuck, man.  You know, two disclaimers.  We have the same agent as him.  Oops.  And I met him once, and he couldn't be, couldn't have been nicer.  Yeah, huh?  Knows us, likes us.  Well, you know what?  Oops.  We're what we are.  We're pieces of shit, and we know it.  When he was doing Love Lines with Adam Carolla, I was out in L.A. when we weren't doing radio,  and Bob goes, you want to go check out Love Lines?  I'm like, sure.  And during a break, Adam Carolla walks out of the studio and goes, what are you doing here? 
[00:47:00]  And just walked past me to have a cigarette.  That's all he said to me.  And Dr. Drew stops and said, oh, hey, it's nice to meet you.  You know, finally heard a lot about you.  You know, all that stuff.  Why don't you sit down, and we can talk about that.  Would you like to be on a reality show?  Couldn't have been nicer, but.  Oh, well, that's just how we treat people.  Well, sorry.  But this, I don't know, these shows he's doing are very suspicious.  Yeah.  Maybe it's helping people out there.  I don't know.  Maybe they're, I don't know. 
[00:47:30]  Is it?  I don't know.  Is it?  I don't know what the fuck to think of it anymore.  All right.  I think it's helping people.  Yeah.  I think it helped us get through an hour of radio.  Exactly.  Guys.  And that's all we care about.  We only got three hours left to go.  Friday, motherfucker.  That's right.  Thank you, Dr. Drew.  You've helped me.  You know what's great about Fridays?  When I got up at five this morning, I went, oh my God, five and a half hours from right  now, my weekend starts.  Is the weekend.  That was my first thought today. 
[00:48:00]  That's not a good attitude to have going in.  Isn't that a poor work ethic?  It's a very poor work ethic.  It is.  Especially for a comedically based talk show as we do.  Why not wake up excited to say, I'm about to go do another show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  Which Scorch does.  No.  And look what happened.  Now, people are probably just tuning in, but we also talked about Ian Halpern because  he's calling today.  Yes.  And one of the things he wants to talk about today, he says, Larry King, I predicted he 
[00:48:30]  was cheating in his marriage three weeks ago in a blind item on your show.  Will he reconcile?  All right, whatever.  But basically, on our show a few weeks ago, he said there's a TV host cheating.  Is that what he said?  Well, we got the clip.  All right, we got the clip.  Let's see.  Because now he's bragging that he knew this, but he wasn't brave enough to tell us flat  out, Larry King is cheating on his wife.  He said it this way, and now he's claiming that he meant Larry King.  So let's listen to the clip from about two or three weeks ago. 
[00:49:00]  A top TV host has been cheating on his wife with an actress at least 20 years younger than  him.  So Larry King was cheating on his wife's sister, right?  He was cheating with his wife's sister.  Right.  Okay.  Is she an actress?  Is she an actress?  No.  How do we know?  Pop her name up.  See if she's done anything.  I don't think she...  Or what her fucking...  I mean, if she's an actress.  She's an aspiring actress.  Okay. 
[00:49:30]  So she's probably done a few, like, indies or something.  You think actress, you're thinking someone you would know.  Well, uh, I don't know.  Who's a host?  Interesting.  I'm not going to speculate.  Any speculation?  Wait, wait, now.  A host cheating with someone 20 years younger.  Damn.  I'm just trying to think of a host who's 25.  20 males with a...  Yeah, right?  Well, I don't know if you want to guess.  Has this host had indiscretions in the past?  Right.  No.  Does his name rhyme with Fetterman? 
[00:50:00]  I've got to keep it blind.  Again, you know, I don't want to get us all sued because I know you guys don't have a pot to piss and I'm going to have to pay all the legal fees.  That's true.  All right.  Say that again.  All right.  So that's from three weeks ago.  Wow.  Did he nail it?  I think he nailed it, dude.  But it doesn't do us any good unless he goes, hey, guys, got a big scoop for you that the whole world's going to talk about.  Larry King is cheating on his wife.  We get it that way.  Once the news comes out, you can go and inform the media that you had this story sort of three weeks ago. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  Thanks, Ian.  You're really helping us out.  But he said, apparently, maybe it wasn't really confirmed.  Yeah, but no one was going to be able to figure out that that was Larry King with that dumb blind item of his.  His contacts had said, you know, it probably was like, dude, he nailed it.  He said a host.  Yeah, but it didn't do us any good.  Younger.  Well, because if he said it on our show, holy shit, the fucking publicity we get.  That's true.  That would have been you. 
[00:51:00]  Well, you know what?  We're going to have to.  Instead, we get this like very vague run around blind item.  Well, I see right now he has a blind item right here today.  Today.  And we're going to push him for more info on this blind item using the Larry King thing against him.  And say, look, look, it was true.  So why didn't you fucking fess up?  You wouldn't have gotten sued.  It's true.  All right.  And now this one, I want to, we'll ask him about that.  Apparently, it involves a Yankee. 
[00:51:30]  That's right.  New York Yankees.  That's right.  Great triple play last night by the Yankees, by the way.  Yeah.  Just exciting, right?  Yep.  Exciting.  Very exciting.  Oh, shut up.  You don't watch me.  I know.  How'd the Habs do?  The Habs play tonight, right?  Yeah, we played tonight.  Oh, they were off?  Yeah.  I hope they do as well as the Devils.  The Devils lost.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  Oh, trap dog.  I'm sorry.  That's just Travis, but it's all right.  Anthony, Devils fans not happy.  No. 
[00:52:00]  I think it's the third year in a row.  Early exit in the playoffs.  Yeah.  They are not happy.  You know what?  Sorry.  Didn't they have a fucking dynasty at one point?  They did okay.  Yeah, they were doing all right.  You go through your fucking, it's an ebbs and flows kind of a thing.  I don't think Kevin Smith is happy today.  He's a big Devils fan.  Huge Devils fan.  Don't call him huge.  Just because they kick him off planes.  Jesus.  Oh, I thought you meant, okay, my mistake.  All right, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, the video that was sent to me and you on Twitter yesterday. 
[00:52:30]  Mm-hmm.  I want to see this and hear this because I hear I might not be happy with it.  Well.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  Look who it is.  It's little Jimmy Norton.  The HBO star has entered the studio.  There he is.  We're going to break, Jimmy.  So settle in and have fun.  And we'll continue with Jim Norton.  We've got a very busy show.  Oh, good.  Very busy show.  Stay there.  The look you just gave the screen, Anthony, priceless.  Oh, well.  Hey, I was just talking about the Devils. 
[00:53:00]  JD in New York City breaks it down for us, Ant.  Fourth year in a row, they're out of the playoffs early.  Yeah.  It goes like this.  Four games to one, four games to one, four games to three, four games to one.  Wow.  That's the Devils in the playoffs the last four seasons.  Thank you, JD.  And speaking of sports really fast, I guess you're Yankees.  Speaking of thoughts.  I guess you're Yankees had a triple play last night.  Yeah, they lost last night against the A's.  4-2.  But a triple play.  First one since like 68 or something like that. 
[00:53:30]  See, even when they lose, they make it like, who cares about the loss?  Wow, a triple play.  That's kind of cool to see, you know.  And they should forget about the loss.  Travis, not a big fan of the triple play.  Travis, what's your problem?  Well, you know, there's only been 700 of them in the history of baseball.  Well, baseball's been around a long time.  How many triple plays do the Habs have?  None.  It's a different sport.  Oh.  So, you know, we'll probably see a few more this year.  Yeah, but the Yankees haven't had one since 68.  That is a rare occasion.  So good for them. 
[00:54:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Is that true?  Yes.  42 years.  Yeah.  And it was, you know, textbook fucking triple play.  It was beautiful.  Was it a good one?  Was it around the horn?  Oh, my God.  Right around.  Yeah.  Oh, it was beautiful.  I like the triple play.  It wasn't one of those where, you know, you kind of could get the three guys out.  Oh, see, you're a purist.  I like the sloppy triple play.  Nah, nah, nah.  The guy just makes an amazing catch.  The guy was already running for home.  He freaking tags him out.  And then the other guy coming from second is like, oh, fuck. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  It's all just one guy.  If it was an unassisted triple play, I would think, hey, that's really cool.  That is really cool.  Because that rarely, rarely ever happens.  But it was, you know, there's been 700 of them.  Yeah, it was a 5-4-3 triple play.  5-4-3.  It looked fucking cool as hell.  Good for them.  Fuck you.  I hope your abs lose.  What the fuck's wrong with you, Travis?  They're on the road to defeat.  What?  I just don't think a triple play.  It's impressive.  How many triple plays a year?  Well, there's been around 700. 
[00:55:00]  Well, there's been 700 seasons of baseball.  Baseball's only been around since slavery days.  Modern baseball, you know, we'll say 1850 or whatever.  So 150 years, 700 triple plays.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, there's a couple a year.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the Yankees haven't had one since 68.  I know.  Good for the Yankees.  That's very rare.  Using your math, it would be about four to five a year.  Yeah.  So, right?  Somewhere around there.  Here we go.  Let me take a look.  How many games are there, too?  How impressive this is.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:55:30]  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Got him.  Yeah, that's all right, man.  That's a good one.  That's pretty good.  That's all right.  That goes Suzuki.  Maybe Suzuki ran a little faster.  That guy hit into it.  How annoying is it when you hit into a triple play?  Oh, you're not going to be the guy that walks into the dugout cheering.  There's no outs.  Two guys on.  It's fantastic, right?  And you get into a triple play.  Yep.  The guy who hit it actually had the three-run homer that won the game.  Oh, he did, did he?  Yeah.  I mean, like just desserts.  Maybe later on, he, uh...  All right, well... 
[00:56:00]  Boy, they must have given him a razzing in the clubhouse.  Oh, ho, ho.  I think the A's have a weird ritual.  Like, if you do something wrong, they'll, like, humiliate you sexually.  Like, when he came in, they probably just pinched his scrotum with their fingernails.  Really hard.  Left a mark.  A little crescent moon mark with his fingernail.  Oh, shit.  And that's, uh...  And the NFL draft happened, and, uh...  Yeah.  Uh, we don't know much about that.  We don't know much about that. 
[00:56:30]  I just know, when I ever see clips on them, people are hooting and hollering and cheering  and...  The NFL draft.  NFL draft is a huge sporting event, man.  Huge now.  They're losing their minds.  It's going on today, too, right?  Third day.  I believe so, right?  It ends today?  Yeah.  Yeah, but now they're into the...  No, it ends tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  Oh, it started yesterday.  It started last night.  I think last night was the first time they've ever done it in prime time.  One of the headlines, uh, Tim Tebow will be playing in the NFL, because there was, uh,  they were wondering if he could play in the NFL, and if he was even going to be drafted. 
[00:57:00]  You know, the Gators, uh, quarterback there, and, uh, Broncos picked him up.  First round.  Oh, yeah?  25th overall pick.  So, that's the only thing I know.  I'm not even gonna...  I'm not even gonna try to fake this shit.  I don't know.  Giants got a defensive player.  Exactly.  Who?  And, uh, what team did he play for in college?  Steve Morgan.  Steve Morgan, and he played for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.  What?  Who was the...  What was the big, like, the big get this year? 
[00:57:30]  Like, does somebody know who the big get was?  Like, holy shit.  I'm sure if we go to...  That's a good fucking player, and...  I'm sure if we go to...  That's gonna change the team.  There's a lot of sports...  Leroy Johnson was actually...  Leroy?  Leroy Johnson.  Yes, Leroy Johnson.  What team did he play for in college?  It was in the movie fame.  Oh, okay.  He couldn't read too good.  Wagon machine.  I mean, there's sports fans, though, that study this stuff.  They know their shit, and they go down there.  Where is it at?  Radio City Music Hall this year?  Yeah, somewhere.  I think so. 
[00:58:00]  And they're there, and it's just a party.  They're cheering.  Woo!  Woo!  All right, Ed.  So...  I don't hear this, bitch.  Yeah, some guy on Twitter.  Not some guy.  What's his name?  Is that the top there?  I should give him credit there.  He's pretty cool.  Mr. Coffee?  Yeah, Mr. Coffee's all right.  Mr. Coffee Says is his Twitter name.  He's a good one to follow, actually.  Sent this video to you and I, and basically he sent it to me to make sure you see it,  because he thinks that this would bother you a little bit, Anthony.  It probably will.  It's a lot of the things you have said about Obama, and the people that support Obama. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, okay.  So let's take a listen to this.  Hello!  This is Kalander, not your mother, an Obama.  Ha ha ha.  And guess what, people?  I love President Obama.  Yes, I do.  I love President Obama.  And guess what?  And guess what?  I voted for him.  Do you want to know why I voted for him?  Do you want to know why?  Do you want to know why? 
[00:59:00]  Because he's black!  He's black, he's black, he's black.  He's black, he's black.  Yes, I said it, and I'll say it again.  I voted for him because he was black.  Yes, I did.  And guess what?  I'm going to get me some health care.  Show enough is.  Show enough.  I don't know why you're looking at me.  You need to be at work so you can pay for my health care.  Ha ha!  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  Yes, I do.  I'm getting healthcare, I ain't got no job. I love America. I love me some America. Me and my seven children. All seven of my children are going to get some healthcare now. Sure enough, sign the bill, honey. Sign the bill. 
[00:59:30]  So, anywho, that's all I got to say about it. And if you don't like President Barack Obama, if you don't like him, then you is a racist. Yes, I said it. You is a racist. Uh-huh. Yeah, you are. Because, you know what, President Obama is doing good by me. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, now, yes, I can. Get sick now. So, y'all keep going to work, making all that money, because your taxes is helping me and my childrens. All right, over now. Thank you. I love America.  America.  America. Obviously, she's mocking people like you, Anthony. Yeah. No, no, obviously, she's putting it on and kind of mocking the people that think that just because Obama's in office, they're going to get all that stuff. 
[01:00:30]  She's mocking a lot of people. I didn't see one ounce of parody. I think that she's... No, you think she's sincere? Yeah, right.  The thing is, I have gone to certain websites, let's just say, and looked at videos that are real, like that same ideology. Well, bring one to the show. Yeah, yeah, should I? What site's that? It's a site that, it's the N-word, right? And then it's followed by Mania. The N-word Mania? Dot com, yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:00]  So, you have to write N-word Mania? See, every other day... N-W-O-R-D Mania?  Every other day, I go to that site, and then on the off days, I go to the black sites, various black militant sites, which the names of those just slipped my mind right now, but they are in my favorites. 
[01:01:30]  Well, if you see videos like this for real, you've got to bring them to the show.  Uh-huh.  She's obviously mocking a lot of different people there in her videos.  There is a woman with, right now I think it's 13 children, and she is living in a hotel room, or a motel room, a real shithole, and they had a whole article on her about how she feels that she's not being helped.  Her husband, by the way, not husband, boyfriend, the father of 10 of the children, which I guess she considers the father, because he fathered, he sired the most of these fucking burdens. 
[01:02:00]  She, uh, he's in prison.  Probably false charges.  It happens, it happens, I know, I know.  And, um, she's saying, what am I supposed to do?  I need money, I need a car, and I need a place to live.  And she was abso-fucking-lutely serious.  So they're ready to give her, like, this, um, it's kind of a shelter for her to go into, because the motel isn't going to let her stay there for nothing. 
[01:02:30]  And she was very leery of the whole thing, like, well, yeah, how long is this going to last?  I need a house.  I need a place.  And then they were like, well, you need to work.  And she goes, I have a job.  It's taking care of my kids.  Taking care of my children.  I need help.  And this was all, like, on the up and up.  I was, I was livid! 
[01:03:00]  So when you, you've got to bring that to the show.  I know.  Now we need to hear the, uh, the audio of that.  Why were you mad, though?  You probably, the poor girl needs some assistance.  Yeah, man.  She had kids from.  It's not her problem that she had 13 kids.  Yeah, it's her fault.  One of our children, they said they were shuffling, all shuffling around barefoot on this disgusting, uh, green carpet in this, uh, motel room.  One of the kids was bottle-feeding, uh, an infant, a newborn.  And another child was well over 18. 
[01:03:30]  She was 37 years old.  13 kids.  Uh, uh, three different fathers.  13 kids?  At 37?  At 37.  Three different fathers.  And just bitching that no one was giving her, her, her money, her car, and a house.  The last five must have just fell out.  Yeah.  Oh, and yeah.  And you should have seen what a lot of the comments were on, um, and were in Mania, uh, was, um, well, take them to the White House. 
[01:04:00]  I'm sure there's room there.  There's probably plenty of rooms at the White House.  Oh, there they are.  Like in the bedroom.  So she could go there and, uh, have her kids taken care of.  Well, can we find this video on it?  It wasn't a video.  I'm sorry.  It was an article.  Oh.  Yeah.  And it was done on the news.  Oh, okay.  Um, but, uh, they didn't have, uh, audio of her.  It was a transcribe.  Oh, okay.  Uh, just, but, but there is plenty of video.  There's the head of, uh, Acorn, I guess, that woman.  Yes.  Who was talking about socialism and, oh my God, I wanted to fucking bash my monitor watching her too. 
[01:04:30]  Uh, saying that the Tea Party movement, which she called the bowel movement.  Ha, ha, ha, get it?  Shit, right?  Um, the Tea Party movement is just a masked, uh, uh, uh, organization of racism.  Just pulled out the race card because it's, uh, basically middle class Americans that don't want to be taxed up the ass to pay for the likes of the 13 fucking kid bitch that's in the hotel. 
[01:05:00]  Uh, but she was saying, uh, that, that socialism is good.  And she's talking to a bunch of, uh, young people, young people about, uh, socialism and how it's a good thing.  And just, I wanted a fucking smacker.  Acorn.  Go get in more trouble trying to fucking get housing for prostitutes.  That was funny.  There's Anthony's big insults.  Go on, get in more trouble.  Why don't you?  Why don't you get in more trouble by gum? 
[01:05:30]  Well, Anthony.  I pulled my pants up.  I'll flip you like a cheese sandwich.  The basics.  So the more kids you have, the more government assistance you have, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So would it be crazy to, uh, put a limit on the amount of kids you could have if you want government assistance in America?  Uh.  Would that be a crazy idea?  No, no, no.  Just cut off the government assistance.  That's all.  I'm just saying, like.  Have as many fucking, have as many burdens as you want.  What if the government turns around and goes, look, after, after six kids, we don't, we don't help you for the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, alone. 
[01:06:00]  Well, that's kind of good.  You could, you know, limit the.  Or is that a crazy idea in America?  Because, well, there are people having children just for the money.  Yeah, they take advantage of the system.  They.  So, what can the government do?  And why aren't they doing anything about it if they know this is going on?  I have no idea.  It's fucking sterilization.  Just fucking hit them with darts.  Like a, like a helicopter over, um, uh, the inner cities with, with, uh, darts, like tranquilizer darts, but only full of some type of sterilizing agent. 
[01:06:30]  And just fucking.  Few.  Few.  Few.  Whoosh.  But that's it.  That's a crazy idea, though.  Drives the womb up like a raisin.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  So, some.  Oh.  Yes.  Of course.  Um.  Yeah, so that had me a little day.  And then Bloomberg's doing some more shenanigans here in New York, which had me just livid this morning.  Well, Bloomberg is our mayor who, who changed the rules so he could have another term because he just feels like New Yorkers really need him in office. 
[01:07:00]  So he completely changed the rules.  He, he was supposed to be out.  The same guy who was against Giuliani having a third term after 9-11.  Yeah, second 9-11.  He had two terms and he goes, you know what, these, these New Yorkers love me.  We got to change the rules.  So he basically broke the law.  I don't even know if they officially changed the rules.  It wasn't even a vote on it.  Right.  It was just him saying yes and.  So now he has a third term and, uh, he's a billionaire.  And we're learning some things about Bloomberg today.  I guess he.  18 billion bucks he's got.  18 billion, by the way, I said.  And I guess he's got a lot of money outside this country, uh, to save, to save on the taxes. 
[01:07:30]  Save on the taxes.  That we all have to pay here.  How about tax-free?  In America.  America.  America.  Tax-free.  He's got money in the Caymans, um, that he, he refuses to talk about.  He says he's got his finance guy that, uh, he doesn't really know what he does with his  money, which I find that a little hard to believe.  Well, he blows it off by going, yeah, uh, my finance guy is taking care of, uh, you know,  some millions that I have, and I don't know what he does with it.  Yeah.  And that's how, that's how he explained this whole thing. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I don't know what he does with it.  And we're supposed to go, oh, okay, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry we asked that, that you're basically, uh, you know, making sure you're not getting  taxed on millions and millions of your dollars.  Yeah.  He said it's all legal, he said, but he won't explain it.  He refuses to talk about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Refused to talk about it.  And as he's just enacting new taxes on everybody here in New York, um, in New York City, he's  got his money stashed away.  Sheltered.  Of course he does.  Yeah.  And the average, the average New Yorker can't do what he does.  No, you can't take 20 bucks down to the Cayman Islands. 
[01:08:30]  Exactly.  Hey, could you put this in the area?  You're measly 2,000 and you're able to put in a bank account.  You can't go and find a guy that's going to take it down to the Cayman Islands for you.  That fucking prick has money stashed overseas?  That's what we're saying, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh my fuck.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  Like this motherfucker.  And he was about to tax, you know, soda.  Everything.  Or is that Patterson?  Patterson.  Patterson's doing the sugar tax.  He's done the same shit, though, in New York City.  There's so many taxes.  Because, um, and now the latest thing he wants to do is, um, 37th Street, right? 
[01:09:00]  Is it 37th or 34th?  Make your local, Ant.  I know, right?  It's pretty much the heart of Manhattan.  34th.  34th Street is basically where the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade ends.  Yeah.  It's Empire State Building.  Empire State Building is right there.  Penn Station's right there.  It's a pretty busy area.  And it's a major thoroughfare between, like, you know, the, the, uh, Lincoln Tunnel and  the Midtown Tunnel.  Kind of, you know, it's, it's, it's very important.  It's, it's a, it's a very important, uh, East, West. 
[01:09:30]  East, thank you.  Yeah.  Just so people could visualize.  Midtown Manhattan.  You take the middle of Manhattan and it, it drives you right through the middle of Manhattan.  Greg, can I guess this asshole wants to shut it down?  He, he wants to, no, alter it a little bit.  Um, he wants to.  Let's shut it down for a block or two.  He wants to make just a pure pedestrian mall, shutting completely between Macy's and the  Empire State Building, where it's just another one of these pedestrian malls, then make it  one way.  It's a one way street going from the new pedestrian mall, uh, west to the river and then from the 
[01:10:00]  pedestrian mall east to the East River.  Basically for the people that aren't from New York, the pedestrian mall would be right in  the center.  Yeah.  And then it would go either east or west, depending on, uh.  So now you're going to have to take another road to go around this pedestrian mall, which  is turns, turns, turns, which means lights and people then crosswalks, which means just  backing up your fucking traffic.  What's wrong with three rights, make it left, Dan?  That's exactly what you're going to have to do. 
[01:10:30]  What's wrong?  And, uh.  Your mother-in-law was on to something.  Blue, burger, grease.  Three rights, make it left.  This $18 billion asshole.  By the way, this is going to cost $30 million to do.  Why are we wasting that fucking money?  Why does it take $30 million to close a block of a street in Manhattan?  You know what the unions are going to charge to change signs and road paint and fucking make  the mall and stuff?  $30 million.  Wouldn't that take one afternoon and a couple of guys? 
[01:11:00]  A baroque-ass city.  Baroque-ass city.  A baroque.  $30 million to fuck traffic up.  To make a pedestrian mall.  What an asshole.  He loves those.  I cannot wait until somebody just decides, it's not a pedestrian mall, it's a street, and  I'm going through.  Yeah.  And just, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  By somebody, you mean you.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Yes, a nice big escalade.  That's amazing, Anthony.  $30 million to do that.  $30 million in a city that just, but I guess he figures it's an investment because, you 
[01:11:30]  know, seats on a road that used to have cars on it apparently brings in lots of money.  And this is what we talk about on the show a lot.  The spending is just out of control.  Why does something like that cost $30 million, and why don't, why doesn't anyone question  that?  Ever.  Ever.  A man that has $18 billion.  Should pay for it himself.  That oversees accounts, doesn't understand.  He has no concept of $30 million being a lot of money. 
[01:12:00]  To him, that's like, oh, we'll put it in.  How much?  $30 million?  All right.  How about you bail New York City out, motherfucker?  Why is he living by the tax codes of New York?  Why is he hiding his fucking money over here?  I don't have money overseas.  No.  No.  Nobody's in the bank here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm getting a half a percent of my money.  Yeah.  I'm doing good.  Which, by the way, gets taxed.  Right.  Your half a percent gets taxed.  Whatever it is.  I don't even know what it is.  That's wonderful.  It's under 1%, right?  Yeah.  For basic savings?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  What is going on in this world?  And he's stashing money away that isn't even seeing the IRS. 
[01:12:30]  And, you know, making us pay $30 million to inconvenience our driving.  $30 million.  He's an ass.  Spending is out of control.  That's where they can save real money.  Not taxing soda.  Don't do that.  Just don't do it.  Not taxing soda pop.  Anthony, Bloomberg is playing a billionaire's version of SimCity.  Yeah.  That's what he's doing.  Let's close that down.  And then there was me with a big exclamation point over my head. 
[01:13:00]  All mad like the game.  That was Pat from Minocchi, by the way.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's true, though.  It's true.  Mike in Virginia.  Mikey.  Hey, basically, the government's easiest way that they can cut budgets is put drug testing on, you know, anybody that needs government assistance, for one.  And then you should also, anybody that's on government assistance, like welfare or any of that garbage, should be forced to have like a depot shot or whatever to make them sterile. 
[01:13:30]  And they should have time limits.  That gets into all kinds of shit, though.  And you want to start sterilizing people, believe me.  Because, you know what would happen?  The majority of the people would be from a certain ethnic background, and they would be crying all kinds of fucking shit about sterilizing more people of one race than another. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  Absolutely.  It's only temporary sterilization, right?  Not permanent.  Temporary.  They have like the implants.  That's what I'm saying.  Like the depot shot, it's a six-month sterile thing for women, you know?  Or fucking just slit their throats.  That also works, you know?  Can you imagine if someone proposed that and that was a bill?  We say that if you have more kids while you're on public assistance that the government slits your throat.  This is all just going to end bad. 
[01:14:30]  We're going to be our own downfall, man.  We really are going to be our own downfall.  We are appeasing and just coddling and placating people that don't contribute, that are detrimental and burdens to our society.  And this administration and the political correctness that's going on these days just grabs them and holds them and says, it's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  And then if you say anything about it negatively, if you're a member of the Tea Party movement, you are labeled a racist. 
[01:15:00]  That's why the term racist to me has no fucking meaning anymore.  It has no meaning.  That's why people call me racist.  I could give a fuck.  I love it.  Call me one.  Because I will just speak my fucking mind.  I got called a racist on Twitter by this girl.  Jimmy, a racist.  By the way, Jimmy's probably one of the least racist people I know.  I'm talking, Ginzo. 
[01:15:30]  Right?  I prefer greasy womp.  No, but it was like, it was one of those, it was the old rant I did.  It was a goof, obviously.  It was the racist promo for like, for a gig.  You know, hello, Jews and niggers and spits.  It was obviously a fucking sarcastic.  Sarcastic.  Just nonsense.  Yeah, idiocy.  Obviously.  Completely.  But you know, this girl, she's like 20 on Twitter.  You're a racist.  Or she called me, so I smashed people back when they attacked me on Twitter. 
[01:16:00]  Just forward it to me and say, you've sent this to the wrong person from the show?  Exactly.  And so I bashed her back a little bit, and the fucking fans jumped on her.  And it just, it tapped into something.  It's not just about, oh, somebody bad-mouthed Jim.  I mean, they don't really care that much about that.  But it's just being called a racist for a racial joke, and they have been fucking killing this girl.  Yeah.  And she actually keeps Twittering back, just make it stop.  I'm sorry. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, man.  I wanted to stop.  Oh, shit.  But then she says things that annoy, like, I never asked anybody to bother her.  But then she'll say something that will annoy the other people.  Like, what, you know?  Whatever it is she says that's just, you know, 20-year-old girlish.  But she just keeps, like, re-fucking annoying the hornet-ness.  It's really fun to watch them all jump on her.  But that really tapped into something.  She's one of the simpletons.  There's a bunch of simpletons out there.  Do you know, um...  That think their fucking opinion matters.  Yeah.  They're just simpletons.  Like, if you can't understand that that was obviously a joke and that you're not racist, 
[01:17:00]  you're a dumb simpleton.  But you can't be afraid of those.  Like, when people...  I'm not saying you should be afraid of anything like that, but they're just...  You shouldn't even give them the time of day.  But when people get called racist, they back up and go, oh, no, I'm...  Right.  And it's like, you should be belligerent about your response.  Sure.  If someone's accusing you of some shit like that, you should be belligerent about it.  And that was to me where I'm as fucked up when he went on Sharpton's show.  And he was nice to him.  And Sharpton brought his dumb daughter out.  Oh, I know.  Isn't that the same daughter?  I don't know if it is who got pulled over for yelling at the cop. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember that episode.  There's just this atmosphere going on now that it's...  And it's complete separatism, too, but it's only one way.  Like, oh, there's something going on at McDonald's that is just ridiculous.  If you've noticed over the years, McDonald's has really set their sights on black people.  Yes.  They have completely changed gears.  And I'd say 90% of McDonald's commercials right now are completely targeted at black people. 
[01:18:00]  They have a website now that McDonald's sponsors that is just dedicated to black people.  And how they can advance and how McDonald's Corporation can help them and how there's diversity programs within McDonald's.  Like, there's this whole thing going on behind the scenes at McDonald's that goes beyond the commercials that is... 
[01:18:30]  Like, it's called 360 Black, I think.  360black.com.  I think that's because they don't want...  They don't want, like, one month a year dedicated to black history and blacks and things like that.  They want it 360 days a year.  And it just seems to me that if any other group got this attention, McDonald's would be getting chastised for it.  Yes. 
[01:19:00]  It's separatism.  That's probably not it.  Maybe it's three fucking...  Well, they're just making up for the fact that black mortality is probably really in bad shape thanks to McDonald's fucking food.  McDonald's USA.  Yeah, McDonald's.com.  And then you go to 365 Black.  Oh, 365.  Because I was wondering, 360, what would happen the other five days?  Exactly, they sponsored the clans.  Right, exactly.  I know, look at me.  Look at five days of the clans.  I can't count the days of the week.  I know, I'm like, what are you talking about, 360 days?  I was thinking compass point.  That would open them up for a lot of abuse. 
[01:19:30]  I was thinking degrees.  The other five days.  But here it is.  And now there's a video on this.  If you go to what is 360, I think the video is on there.  If you scroll down.  No, maybe it's one of the other subjects.  Opportunities.  Maybe it's on opportunities.  But there's just all black people popping up.  Yeah, there's the video.  There's the video.  And it's all just black people.  It's called 365 Black.  We all know and love McDonald's. 
[01:20:00]  That's where we get some of our favorite chips.  This is the music.  The jazzy music, yeah.  Like hamburgers, premium chicken, the griddles, and of course the fries.  Yeah.  Healthy food.  But we'd like to give you a deeper look into our corporation to see all of the business opportunities going on under the arches.  For black people.  The corporate diversity goals help build news for professional development, allowing employees to achieve high levels of security.  There's no diversity.  It's all black.  At McDonald's.  We know.  They've shown about 20 black people so far.  The vice president of U.S. marketing strategy.  That's why I know it's like that.  Greg Watson. 
[01:20:30]  He's a black guy.  Where's the diversity?  I mean by individual franchisees.  Hence the black market.  Diversity just means anything but white.  Right.  That's what diversity means.  Yes, anything but white.  But it shouldn't be that.  The United Negro College Fund.  Right.  And the Thorogood Marshall College Fund.  365 Black.  Thorogood College.  United Negro College Fund.  They've nothing about white charity people.  That was a little light though.  But still black.  There's a National Black McDonald's Operators fucking organization. 
[01:21:00]  Speaking of dollars, McDonald's also spends hundreds of millions.  Speaking of dollars, give me yours.  They're getting almost wiped out.  They're getting lighter as this goes on.  We have been a supplier of ice cream toppings and dipping sauce.  And now the suppliers to McDonald's, they search for black-owned companies to supply McDonald's.  So McDonald's is a black company?  Differences?  There's no difference.  No. 
[01:21:30]  Ray Kroc is spinning.  No, this is smart marketing.  Is it?  McDonald's is deeply ridiculous.  I'm telling you, this type of shit.  365 days.  As much as it's annoying, it really, all it's saying is, hey, look, how does it, you're still considered the underclass in this country.  When that's tolerated, like, the people who are doing well will tolerate that and that type of fucking double standard.  Because we don't need that.  You do. 
[01:22:00]  Exactly.  And that's McDonald's because the bottom line is there's a lot of McDonald's in black neighborhoods.  White people are not, I'm sure they eat McDonald's.  But I think white people have probably moved more away from McDonald's.  They have.  For health reasons.  Why?  Then why can't black people move away from McDonald's for health reasons, too?  Well, that's what, well, they're, it's probably more affordable.  And, and, but, but also.  Is it?  It costs an arm and a leg to eat at fucking McDonald's.  Now, you can eat pretty cheap at McDonald's and they're in, they get a lot of criticism because, like, you go into a black neighborhood and all you find is Popeye's, McDonald's, all these shitty foods. 
[01:22:30]  Like, there are no fucking places that open up there.  Like, if Starbucks opens up, I think they do well.  But a lot of these places don't open up.  So I think McDonald's is trying to make it look like they're messing up these predators who are just throwing this fucking shit into black neighborhoods.  Like, look, see, we're a friend of the black community.  We're not just pumping it full of Big Macs and shitty fries and the entire country is trying to lose weight.  And here we are shoving food in your fucking face.  It's fattening.  That's a, that's a bull, it's like bullshit.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's a way, it's almost like when you go down, when I go down to Brazil and get hookers, I'm going out and get Brazilian whores. 
[01:23:00]  If I started to help the Brazilian men foundation, because on some level I realized that I'm down here fucking your women for money.  To be harsh, that's a bunch of Uncle Toms, basically.  And I mean, it's, it's, it's really a, a truly a, a big time white company, but they're pushing some black people forward to say, look, no, we're doing a lot more than just giving you the shitty, uh, food.  And I mean shitty as far as healthy goes.  Yeah, I wouldn't say that the, I mean, it's delicious, we all know that, but shitty as far as health goes. 
[01:23:30]  I wouldn't say they're Uncle Toms, because it's not like they're side-  Not Uncle Toms, but I mean, just, but they're pushing the, the black forward, even though the company probably isn't run by a majority of black people.  Yeah, I think, I think they, they did hire a, perhaps a CEO, I think is now, um, a black guy.  I'm not, I'm not sure, but the, you saw the vice president of marketing for the U.S. is a black guy.  And the marketing that they're doing is absolutely aimed at, at black people.  McDonald's has completely changed their marketing strategy from many years ago when it was Ronald McDonald and, you know, a lot of white people and, you know, just fucking whatever. 
[01:24:00]  Well, I remember going to McDonald's as a kid and it wasn't predominantly black or white.  It was just the place you went.  Now they're really targeting just black people.  Well, because, but Jimmy really did explain that.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, minorities are still eating unhealthy in general.  Well, who's fucking choice?  Why people have, honestly, part of it is, I'm sorry, part of it is. 
[01:24:30]  Patrice has gone down this road with us a bunch of times.  Part of it really is affordability.  Like, when you go to an airport, picture it, I scream all the time.  You just want something healthy, right?  I scream, you scream, we all scream.  For ice cream.  I used to get there and say, I scream, you scream.  We all scream for cum.  But it's like, I yell all the time, me and Kenny are in the airport.  I'm like, this is why we're a country of fat fucks.  Because you literally, I want to eat something healthy and there's nothing.  There's a McDonald's open and there's a couple of other places.  Yeah.  So that's what it's like in an airport.  I make good money and I travel and I still have trouble when I'm fucking traveling eating good. 
[01:25:00]  If you make shit money and you live in fucking 145th and fucking Edgecombe and you make no money and that's all that there is, what are you going to eat?  You've got to eat.  The problem is it's not profitable, though.  That's why you don't have the healthy choices in airports and other places.  There's just not enough people going out of their way to eat healthy.  That would do that.  That's the problem.  We're a nation of slobs.  Because if people were eating healthy, then it would be profitable and you would see healthier choices out there.  Here's what I think.  I also watched something that I guess Chris Hansen was doing. 
[01:25:30]  He's gotten off of the whole pedo thing.  God, is that annoying that they made him stop doing that.  I know.  What happened?  Because some stumbag in Dallas killed himself as he should have.  That's how the show ended?  Fucking good.  And the fact they buckle to that.  I know.  That's when you push forward.  You realize, oh my God, we're getting something accomplished here.  Oh, sorry.  Don't keep going up to pedophiles because we might entrap some guy to show up and try to fuck a 13-year-old.  Thank God that guy killed himself.  At least now the heat's off.  Whenever someone says you want some iced tea, I don't have to start sweating. 
[01:26:00]  That's easy.  I know how many times I fell for that.  Oh, Jesus.  The world is insane.  They really, that's the reason they stopped.  Here's, here's it.  Oh, my God.  Chris Hansen did something on Detroit.  And Detroit is a fucking disaster.  Yes, it is.  He flew over Detroit in a helicopter and took video straight down and it looked like a war zone.  The powers that be in Detroit, the mayor and whatnot, want to actually bulldoze a shitload of Detroit to consolidate it and move the borders in. 
[01:26:30]  So Detroit will be a smaller city and easily, more easily controlled because if you look, it is a war zone.  There are complete neighborhoods that are burnt out, factories that are burnt down, look like they've been blown up.  Looks like fucking Dresden after the bombing.  And he had a statistic that there were 700 liquor stores in the Detroit area and eight supermarkets. 
[01:27:00]  And the thing is, it's like, well, like now I go back to the McDonald's thing.  Why isn't McDonald's being criticized for targeting the black community with this food that is inherently unhealthy and dragging them in for their money, giving them unhealthy food?  Why aren't black leaders really getting up in arms against McDonald's? 
[01:27:30]  And it's because what you said, they do things like this.  Yes.  And that does make it a brilliant marketing strategy.  It's just like, hey, look, we're helping the community by pumping them full of fucking, you know, more cholesterol in a day than you're supposed to have in a month.  Well, they got a salad, though.  Yeah, they do have a salad.  With croutons, which are worse than...  I know, fucking little walnuts with sugar on them.  Fucking lard dressing.  Didn't they say that some of these salads are worse than actually eating burgers?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  So I just find it like that's offensive.  The I have brought up the the alarm company that just uses white people and that stupid AJ that comes to the back door when she's ready to open it.  I never get over that goddamn commercial for Broadview security.  AJ seems like a nice guy.  AJ's at the door just kicking his shoes together.  He's looking down, kind of like, and she goes, goodbye, AJ.  And AJ goes, take it easy. 
[01:28:30]  And he's just looking down and kicking his feet like, oh, gosh.  Yeah.  And then her girlfriend goes, who's that?  And she goes, she looks at him, goes, she looks at her, goes, I don't know.  But she's smiling like, this guy is fucking hot.  Oh, it's AJ.  And she's meeting and stuff.  So she blows the candles out.  She sets her alarm first thing and blows the candles out.  And then she's like washing some dishes and then she looks at the door and she goes, AJ, like, all right, AJ, come on back in now that the party's over. 
[01:29:00]  Come on back in my pussy.  Just say, like, I forgot something.  Did you see a cell phone?  Hi, I'm sorry.  I forgot.  He's in.  Yeah, he's in.  What's the name of that company?  Broadview security.  That, but again.  All white people breaking into white people's houses.  And that's the only black person you'll ever see is at the, at the Broadview control center.  At the nerve center.  Calling going, can we send assistance?  But it's, it's not real.  It's, again, that's the luxury of the ruling class to slap its own hand. 
[01:29:30]  That's all.  Is that it?  Of course it is.  Yeah.  It's such paternalistic dog shit that it's so unbelievable and idiotic.  Like, it really does show you that anybody buys into that and thinks that, wow, that's  a good thing they're balancing the scale.  Where's the diversity in these commercials?  Where's the diversity in these fucking commercials?  You know what that is?  That's, this is the equivalent.  I hate the word diversity.  It really has, because it means anything.  It's fucking horrendous.  That's the equivalent of a bunch of white guys in a boardroom going, all right, look. 
[01:30:00]  We show black criminals that Jigs are going to get up in arms.  Fuck it.  You know this.  Make up wine.  You know this.  Yeah.  How many black guys are on the board of that company?  Probably none.  Yeah.  That's a bunch of white guys.  Don't have, fuck it.  Don't let the spokes get all crazy.  Make them white.  They'll get all crazy about this one and boycott our company.  Yeah, they are.  Listen, let's change gears for a second here.  We got Jackie Martling on the hotline.  Jackie.  Speaking of racists.  What's up, you racist?  Hello, man.  Jackie Martling. 
[01:30:30]  Jackie, what's up?  Yo, so I got one for you.  All right.  So a guy breaks into a sperm bank.  He's wearing a bag over his head.  He's got a gun.  And the girl says, no, no, no, this isn't a regular bag.  It's a sperm bank.  He says, I know what it is.  Open up that refrigerator.  She opens up the refrigerator.  He says, take out one of those bottles.  Takes out one of the bottles.  He says, take off the cap.  Takes off the cap.  He says, not drink it.  She drinks it down.  He takes off the bag.  It's her husband.  He says, see, it ain't so bad.  Jackie.  I got your email last night. 
[01:31:00]  I told Anthony, you really know how to plug a gig.  Because I'm reading your email.  And then you go, you know, after my gig on Friday night or tonight, I'm going to take the  whole crowd to FH Riley's, you know, your brother's restaurant.  And I'm like, ah, fuck, yeah, we got to get Jackie Marling on the phone.  Well, you know, I got to tell you the absolute truth.  It worked backwards.  Because my sister, Katie, emailed me and said, oh, we're all coming to the show tonight. 
[01:31:30]  All my friends are up my ass about, are we going out afterwards like last time?  And I said, yeah, you know.  And that plays in Huntington again.  And I said, Jesus Christ, it never even dawned on me to call open air.  Give me a promotion, you know, a plug.  Right.  So it was actually a chromatic thing, you know what I'm saying?  Ah, it's all good.  It's all good.  You call our show anytime, Jackie.  It all works.  Actually, my brother played at that place down there at Five Towns.  And it's a great, it's really a great venue.  Was it called something else? 
[01:32:00]  It's just like an old high school, but it's a great auditorium.  And now they call it the Performing Arts Center.  And it's great, you know.  Dix Hills Performing Arts Center, Five Towns College.  Dix Hills, New York tonight with Jackie the Joke Man at 730, right?  Yeah, and it's 730, which is very early, you know.  I like that.  I like the 730 start time.  Still gives you time to go out and get tanked later.  That's right.  Plenty of time to get to your brother's place and spend a lot of money.  Yeah, before the kitchen closes.  Because I think last time, Jackie, you came around, the kitchen was closed. 
[01:32:30]  He shows up at 1 in the morning and expecting...  Don't open up the kitchen for Jackie?  Come on.  The guy went home already.  Jesus.  Yeah, and Jesus Christ, you know, I don't drink.  You know, the only thing I got in my whole life is a few chicken wings, and some of the fish isn't even there.  Right, he was gone.  You would still drink.  It's just you reached your limit at 30.  You know what's great is I got a special guest tonight because he's in town.  It's my buddy Richie Minovini.  Oh, yeah, Rich, sure.  We actually started comedy in Huntington at Cinnamon at a little restaurant 31 years ago. 
[01:33:00]  And, you know, when comics are just starting out, everybody tells lies to each other because they want to, you know, up themselves and feel better.  And due to him telling me a lie is how I got to hang out with Rodney Dangerfield.  He told me that he had met Rodney, and Rodney loved him, so I typed out a bunch of jokes, and then I said, here, hand these to Rodney.  And he said, I'm full of shit.  I didn't meet Rodney.  So then I just mailed the jokes to Rodney, and Rodney called me up.  You know, and Richie's been kicking himself for 30 years. 
[01:33:30]  It's great.  I love it.  Yeah, Richie's good.  It's Norton.  Tell him I said hi, man.  Richie, Richie, didn't he used to book Eastside?  I think he had me booked at Eastside, and I got there in the fucking padlocks.  He owned the place.  Okay.  Right up until they put that big lock on the front door.  Dude, I was booked there that weekend.  Literally, I got there, and literally there was a fucking lock on the door.  There was a sheriff's lock on the door.  I had never seen anything like it, so tell him he owes me 500 bucks.  Richie showed up at the club.  Richie showed up at the club, and they were carrying the cash registers and the chairs and tables out.  It looked like the bar that was closing up in Goodfellas. 
[01:34:00]  They're just like...  Exactly.  Yeah, and just taking shit out of it.  Oh, my God.  He's a great guy.  I'm going to be, he's a great character.  Yeah, we saw him, a guy, we saw him kind of recently backstage somewhere.  I forgot where that was.  Maybe Westbury.  Kevin James?  Yeah.  He's a good character.  And then, of all things, I'm going to Los Angeles tomorrow, and I'm going to be at this THC convention.  Oh.  Because they're actually having a THC convention at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
[01:34:30]  Pod is a big deal now.  Yeah, especially in California.  Are you still partaking in a little bit of weed there, Jackie?  Well, you know, I got a new CD out, and the CD has my theme song.  And you know my theme song, I'm Smoking Pod, I Got My Dick Out.  And they flipped over the song, so I'm going to be sitting there, you know, from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock tomorrow night.  I'm going to be sitting there blasting a song and selling the CD.  And I don't know if it's going to be medical marijuana, people walking around, or whether I'm going to be sitting in the middle of Jamaica. 
[01:35:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But it's going to be wacky, you know.  We're going to be, I think we're going to legalize pot soon, man.  Yeah.  It's looking that way.  We're moving quickly to that direction.  State by state.  I'm sure some states aren't.  Oh, sure.  You know, the states seem to be leapfrogging each other.  And somebody told me that now in Colorado, you can actually sell pot and make money.  And, you know, it's beyond medical marijuana that's taken even a leap forward from that.  So it looks like it's actually happening, you know. 
[01:35:30]  And I've heard that the people that are against legalizing pot are the fucking guys that grow pot illegally.  Because they put them shit out of luck.  Yep.  Of course.  It's going to be controlled.  Yeah, exactly.  Their business is going to go down.  God damn.  And I don't know what I'm going to do, because I don't drink and drive anymore.  And if they legalize pot, I've got to find something brand new.  I need a new water break.  Yeah, you need a vice.  Everyone needs a vice.  You know, we talk about the drinking and driving thing.  When we were growing up, it was, you know, people don't want to hear this. 
[01:36:00]  It was kind of a sport.  And everyone understood the sport of drinking and driving.  Yeah.  The cops understood.  They pull you over and go, oh, have you been drinking?  And you tell them, yeah.  And then all of a sudden, they take your keys and make you sit on the side of the road for like four or five hours.  And they come back and give you your keys back.  They do their rounds, yeah.  They do their rounds.  Yeah, they pull us over and say, Jesus Christ, do you think you can get this thing home, you know?  You need to take bumper cars.  You know, like bumper bowling.  You know, you're driving home and all of a sudden you smash into the curb and it wakes you up.  Yeah, that's a lot of the curves before I thought. 
[01:36:30]  Obviously a very serious topic, but the times were different 20 years ago.  It just had a different flavor.  You know, I mean, back in those days, death didn't hurt as bad.  You know what it was?  We were stupid is what it was.  Why don't you say it out loud?  We were all, nobody knew any better.  Yeah.  We were idiots.  Yeah.  If you were drinking, you know, if you were hammered and couldn't even stand up, that might be an issue.  But if you were just drinking a few beers where you would be legally drunk today, the cop would usually go, you know, all right, get home. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  You know, just take it.  Sometimes they would call you home.  Yeah, yeah, sometimes they just need to sit it out on the side of the road.  Andy Griffith kind of a Barney Fife thing that they would do for you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the rule is kind of, if you can find your car, you're all right to drive.  There you go.  See, I found my car, right?  You ever have a friend that didn't drink be the decoy when you were leaving the bar?  That worked out great.  We knew a couple of guys that just didn't drink, or maybe that night wasn't drinking.  He'd hop in the car and leave the parking lot a little aggressively, because there were certain bars that cops would just wait in front of. 
[01:37:30]  Of course.  Or down the road or whatever.  Yeah.  Or roadblock.  And he would take off a little aggressively, and when the cop would pull out after him, ten people would leave the parking lot all hammered off of their fucking mouth.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The decoy.  You let the one sober guy take off?  Yeah, because he could get pulled over.  He's legal.  He's fine.  He could do a slight swerve or something.  Yeah, a little swerve.  He'd be like, ah, the road is a little wet, officer.  What are you going to do? 
[01:38:00]  I was turning the radio station.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure I'll take your test.  No problem.  By the way, ten drunks just fucking left the bar.  Did you really do that?  Oh, yeah.  The decoy.  Jackie did.  They shut down.  The designated drunk.  Yeah, exactly.  They shut down Huntington as far as that stuff goes.  You know, I'm from the Huntington area.  Jackie knows Huntington pretty well as well.  Oh, yeah.  And it turned out to be a drinking town where everyone else from Long Island would come to Huntington to party.  I mean, it was like spring break all the time.  People just drunk wandering around the streets.  And they finally said, no way. 
[01:38:30]  And they set up so many roadblocks on the streets leading out of Huntington to just shut the whole thing down.  So all those bars are now restaurants.  You just can't do it anymore.  No.  And that's a good thing, obviously.  Oyster Bay used to be the same way where everybody went to drink.  But back in the 60s, you know, nobody ever got pulled over.  I mean, it just wasn't an issue because everybody was drunk.  I mean, everybody was.  I can't believe there weren't more accidents.  You know, it's hard to believe.  Things like, yeah, Oyster Bay.  And then, you know, when you go down into Northport also, the street's lined. 
[01:39:00]  Main Street is lined with fucking bars.  You're going there to drink.  The North Shore is just the most drunk and crazy place in the world.  It really is.  Well, it's all there and everything else.  You know, as I joke, I do have to say I'm glad they cleaned it up because my house used to get hit by drunk drivers all the time.  I don't know how many stories I've told over the years, but, Jackie, I used to live on 25A right around a bend, and they would come out of Huntington.  They would actually hit the guardrail about, let's call it, I don't know, 200, 300 yards before my house, and then they would ricochet right into our house. 
[01:39:30]  They once hit our house so hard that we couldn't open any doors and took out the whole right side of our house one night.  The car rolled all the way into the backyard.  People are saying that's how you met Billy Joel.  You know, I always laugh at that because the house he hit is literally a quarter of a mile from my house here in Bayville. 
[01:40:00]  And I said, Jesus Christ, people have been drinking and driving and doing drugs on the North Shore for 300 years, and I hadn't ever heard of anybody hitting a house, and he did it on a Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock.  Yeah, that's a little odd.  Yeah, that is.  Like a monument or something.  I'm not sure what it was.  Yeah, yeah.  At that hour on a Sunday, yikes.  There was another time a drunk accident in front of our house, and the car was flipped over.  It was on its hood.  And all you heard, like, you know, now 25 A is really quiet because it's like 4 in the morning. 
[01:40:30]  All of a sudden you heard, because we lived pretty much right on the street, was help me, help me, help me.  My dad gets up, and there's a guy just in his car upside down with an electrical wire across the car, just like a fucking movie, a live wire.  My dad saved that guy's life.  Jesus.  There was at least three or four in front of our house when I was growing up, at least.  And we haven't had one, not gone, whatever, in many years because they, you know, they changed the laws.  You just made me think of a great thing.  You're not going to believe this. 
[01:41:00]  This is an absolute true story.  I was in the cleaner like a couple weeks after Billy's thing where he hit the house.  And I see my old friend, Steve Lukovic, sister Celeste.  I say, hey, how you doing?  She's all right.  And I must have just come up and said, dude, I can't believe, you know, that Billy Joel hit a house on Bago Avenue.  And she goes, you don't even know how crazy it is.  She says, that's my aunt's house.  And he almost killed her.  Jesus.  And I said, what are you talking about? 
[01:41:30]  And you know how the tabloids and the media are, right?  This woman's like 88 years old.  She's lived in that house her whole life.  Billy comes around the corner.  And, oh, you know, he had like the, he went up on the glass and I think he hit the porch.  You know, he didn't go, he wasn't in the living room, for Christ's sake.  You know what I mean?  Right.  But he did hit the house.  But the media descended on the house, pulled her out of there, put her in a chair.  Everybody wanted to talk to her, interview her, make her up.  And Celeste said the pressure of all the media almost killed her aunt. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, the pressure of the media.  Yeah, it wasn't the, it wasn't the house that almost barreled through the living room.  It was the media.  Of course.  It was the media.  Of course.  It was the media.  What happened?  Where were you?  What are your, what's your opinion?  And she had no idea who the hell Billy Joel was.  You know, she wouldn't have known who it was if it was Frank Sinatra.  Oh, yeah.  There's a, there's a big story in Long Island right now.  Like a young woman on pills, uh, barreled into a lady, like.  Oh, yeah.  Killed her.  Killed her.  Killed her.  As she was cutting her grass. 
[01:42:30]  And, and she commented, said, oh, it's not that bad because she was old.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Oh, and the media is just having a field day with her.  Oh, please tell me she didn't say that.  Yeah, that's, yeah.  Something like that.  I'm paraphrasing, but basically said, oh, it's not that bad because she was, she was  all, you know, she was old.  That's not good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it's not like it was a woman with a baby carriage.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  That's how she was justified.  Now, that, that was like a, that was, that was literally in the house.  Like, that, that van or car, whatever it was.  Yeah, yeah, the van. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, that plowed.  Yeah, she, she was gone.  She was on some drugs, apparently.  Well, she plowed the, the woman cutting the grass and then, yeah, ended up in the house.  In the house.  Yeah.  Ow.  Ouch.  Unbelievable.  Why don't we, uh, say where Jackie's going to be tonight, 730.  Jackie's going to be at the Dix Hills Performing Arts Center, Five Towns College, Dix Hills,  New York, 730.  It's a great show, man.  Yeah.  Jackie's been just, uh, doing this forever and, man, he knows how to make you laugh.  I'm telling you.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah, I, I'm running to, to, uh, drop off my car. 
[01:43:30]  I got the THC convention tomorrow night and my new CD, I'm going to send you guys a case  of CDs.  I don't know if you want to give them out or show them.  Yeah, we'll give them out.  We'll play a couple tracks.  We'll steal some.  And, uh, and of course, jokeland.com.  And, uh, are you really coming to FH Riley's tonight?  Cause I'll make sure my brother does keep the kitchen open.  No, I'm absolutely going to announce on the stage that, uh, we're all going over there.  So tell him, tell him to save me some chicken wings.  Okay.  And, uh, we'll have a great old time.  Listen, I'm really sorry I couldn't come in there and live, but I want to come in there  again.  I had so much fun with you guys. 
[01:44:00]  I can't believe how many people heard it.  Like, you know, the whole world told me they heard me on your show.  Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll do it again.  And, and it's the Buffalo chicken spring rolls you really want to try.  Those are really good.  They're ridiculous.  And you got to show up, Jackie, because it's bad enough that we're plugging a place, but  I don't think we should be plugging the individual menu items.  Well, I do have to say this, Victoria Gotti said she was going to go to FH Riley's and,  uh, you know, she never showed.  So you better show tonight, Jackie.  I'll be, listen, let me give you a goodbye joke.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hit it.  The kid says, ma, how come I'm black and you're white? 
[01:44:30]  She says, listen, the way I remember that party, you're lucky you don't fucking bark.  And with that, we'll see you guys.  I really appreciate it.  All right.  No problem.  Thank you, Jackie.  See you then.  Well, Steve, thanks.  Tell the producer, he gets no, he gets no credit.  Steve, thank you.  Of course.  Why would he?  Why would he?  And also, fuck him.  All right.  There you go.  That's more accurate.  Thank you.  Jackie, uh, the joke man.  Jackie Martling will be on Long Island tonight at 730.  Dixills performing our center. 
[01:45:00]  A quick break and we'll continue.  We got, uh, who's next?  We got a lot of guests today.  Ian Halpern will be on at 830 tonight.  Oh, Google it.  We got some, uh, things to talk out with him.  That's for sure.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  I wanted to, uh, mention for the Stress Factory, we got an interesting request from Schimmel to come on. 
[01:45:30]  I believe he reached out because he didn't realize Howard was off on Friday.  We just had too many people today with, uh, we had Dana calling in, Mary Carey, and we had, uh, Jackie.  So if you're in the Stress Factory area, I just wanted to plug him.  He's a great comic and he's a sweet guy.  732-545-HA-HA.  If you live in the, uh, Central Jersey area, catch Schimmel tonight or tomorrow at the Stress Factory.  If you haven't seen him, he's great.  I understand he's not doing too well.  You want to try to squeeze him in somewhere?  I don't even, I honestly don't even know if he's in the building or where he is or if he reached out or maybe Vinny just called. 
[01:46:00]  I really don't know.  I didn't know he was local, um, I actually tempted to go see him.  Well, Steve, find out where he is and, uh, I don't know.  We'll get a call from Australia.  Robert in Australia.  Let's try to squeeze him in.  We just have a lot of people on the show today.  And we want to do, you know, some, some stuff, just, uh, us three.  So, speaking of which, um, the Best Cry Ever thing is now auto-tuned.  And I, someone, and someone also sent me, and I didn't get to hear it, maybe Danny did or somebody else, that, uh, they used the Best Cry Audio about running out of chicken. 
[01:46:30]  I haven't, I, it's somewhere on my Twitter.  It's going to, it's going to be pretty tough to find on my Twitter, but maybe it's out there on YouTube.  Take a listen, see if it's worth playing.  But you remember the whole, you know, running out of chicken thing.  They, they, they, they remixed, uh, Best Cry Ever into that piece.  Oh, god damn, okay, that's funny.  I mean, it sounds like it has potential to be really funny.  Definitely.  Or it could be a bust, so.  Uh, nothing with that fucking cry is a bust, by the way.  Everything works. 
[01:47:00]  Just hearing it is great.  Well, here it is.  Fast food chain Popeye's became a victim of its own advertising today.  So many customers lined up for a big special.  Some locations, including one in Penfield and the city, ran out of chicken.  All right. 
[01:47:30]  So true crying black people.  That is fantastic.  So visual's great, so go to Best Cry Ever, Popeye's Runs Out of Chicken.  Yeah.  Put that in, uh, YouTube.  Uh, holy shit, that's fucking funny.  They actually just took the, uh, audio and video from one thing.  Oh, Jimmy.  And mixed it with another.  Literal Jimmy.  Jimmy.  That is very funny.  That's great.  That is, that is the best pent-up whale.  Oh.  Ever.  Because he does.  Wow.  It comes out of it, it's zero to, to a hundred. 
[01:48:00]  It's like John Coffey getting rid of the fucking sick.  Yeah.  Danny, give me that leg, because they're already asking for it.  Hey, uh, and with that, we also have it auto-tuned, so let's take a look at that, uh, take a listen  Because I know, somewhere deep down in my heart, I still love you.  It's like that sound that came out of the phone in The Matrix. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, it was Booger Couch that sent me that, sorry, in Arkansas. 
[01:49:00]  And Puddle of Aids, he's got a website, what is it?  Puddle of Aids?  TheTedWilliamsHead.com, or is it TedWilliamsHead.com?  And he's putting some good stuff up there.  And he's got a best cry ever with the Christian Bale rant up there.  So maybe that's worth taking a listen to as well for the show.  Is it TedWilliamsHead.com, Puddle?  POA?  All right.  Talking to nobody. 
[01:49:30]  God, what was I going to say?  I kind of thought I forgot it.  What is it?  TedWilliamsHead.com?  It's like a blog site, and there's some good stuff on there.  Yeah?  What were we going to say, Jimmy?  I don't know, right?  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't bad.  It might have been something about the greatest cry.  It says it's TedWilliamsHead.com.  TedWilliamsHead.com?  I don't remember.  Looks like a professional fucking site, man.  All right.  Larry King's in trouble, Ant? 
[01:50:00]  Well, he's always in it.  Isn't Larry King just always in it now?  Always in, always bad.  What did he do now?  What happened?  He said something.  Are we all right?  What happened?  I don't know.  Jimmy forgot.  I'm fucking rolling my arm.  What were you going to say, Jimmy?  I don't fucking remember, dude.  And literally, I still had my finger up.  Like, everything was ready to talk except the thought.  That's what I saw, dude.  I think that threw me off, too. 
[01:50:30]  We were playing the auto-tuning the guy.  Yeah.  And you were going to say something.  Terry Schiavo in there could be good, too.  Yeah.  Best guy ever with Terry Schiavo.  Terry Schiavo.  That could be pretty good, too.  I just don't remember.  All right.  No worries.  We're back on track.  Okay.  So, Larry King in trouble for saying he agrees that Sarah Palin should be in Playboy.  Why would you get in trouble for that?  I agree.  76.  He's probably fucking his wife's sister.  Who gives a shit?  Oh, and his fucking wife is getting banged by the Little League coach. 
[01:51:00]  Exactly.  Let him fucking say whatever he wants at this point.  Why is it bad to say that?  Break it down.  Why is it bad to say that?  Break it down.  For him to say it, it probably looks bad.  If we say it, no one cares.  If he says it, he's got, like, this reputation.  What's his reputation?  Do you watch his show?  I know, but you know what?  You see who he interviews on a nightly basis?  If you ask people, a lot of people would say, like, hey, what does Larry King do?  Oh, he's the interviewer on that. 
[01:51:30]  We would be like, oh, he's the blithering old fool.  I think if it was, like, Brian Williams, of course, then I would agree with you.  It's Larry King.  He's not in that league.  People still remember him as being the guy that just does interviews.  He's more in the tabloid.  Well, now, can I say that if it's women's groups who are attacking him, I don't know if it is, but if it's women's groups, they fucking hate Sarah Palin.  Yeah, true.  They despise, not despise her.  Nobody is despised. 
[01:52:00]  I have no home.  But, you know, other people have said shit about her, and they never come to our defense.  Why now?  If that's who it is.  I can't imagine a men's group coming out after Larry King.  Well, here's the clip.  We can't leave without asking you.  My producers say I must ask you.  Sarah Palin, what do you think?  Sarah Palin.  I've got to say her name because we have to say it every night.  Sarah Palin.  What do you say?  About what? 
[01:52:30]  Her posing in Playboy?  I think she should go for it.  Agreed.  Thank you, Sarah.  Oh, so that's Sarah Silverman.  Yeah.  So you got a comedian on to begin with.  And all he did was say he agreed.  What the fuck is the problem?  I'll tell you what happened.  I think he caught Sarah Silverman off guard, or maybe he referenced a joke she had done.  Yeah, come on.  What do you say?  What do you say?  It's like forcing people to say shit.  Well, here you go, guys.  As might be expected, the comment has irked some, even though he just said agreed. 
[01:53:00]  Lulu Flores, president of the National Women's Political Caucus.  There you go.  Lulu Caucus.  Told Politico that King's comments were way, and there's a lot of A's in the word way, and  a lot of Y's.  Way!  Perfect.  Inappropriate.  That was her quote.  Way!  I hope Lulu's vag gets stuck to the toilet seat in a glue accident.  Inappropriate.  Referring to King's recent divorce filings to end his eighth marriage, Laura Ingram said, 
[01:53:30]  Larry, when you're in a hole, stop digging.  Larry should pose for Viagra Monthly, said Aunt Culkin.  No!  Stop!  Aunt Culkin's beating him up over that?  She's just probably just shitting on him because she likes Sarah.  She'll shit on people.  Yeah.  She's probably just attacking him almost like he wouldn't say that about Michelle Obama.  I'm just saying, whatever.  But the thing with Larry, that's what happened.  It seems to me like he might have referenced the joke Sarah did. 
[01:54:00]  You know, the fucking shitty producers will do that sometimes, where she might have done  a joke about Sarah Playboy.  Ask her about it.  And then all she can do is go, what, the Playboy?  Yeah.  And then he's kind of awkward because he didn't laugh.  He's like, agreed.  And he just got out of it.  Yeah.  People don't know when people are just reacting spontaneously.  Knee jerk reactions to nothing.  Lulu stinks.  Yeah, nothing will come out of that.  Lulu.  I want to rub clear stuff on Lulu's forehead, walk around like that feeling silly, like  it's Ash Wednesday, but Mike Combsy. 
[01:54:30]  Take that, you fucking 1967 singer name.  Boo.  Lulu.  What an awful fucking fat girl name that is.  Lulu.  It really is.  It sounds like a retarded girl.  What happened?  Lulu had an accident.  Yeah.  Lulu again.  Yeah.  She's got a lollipop with dirt on it and shit in her pants.  Yeah.  What are you doing with a bowl?  Lulu needs a haircut.  What's that paint roll in?  Lulu's tongue is wet.  Jesus.  Why is there an ice cream cone with a bunch of pennies stacked in it? 
[01:55:00]  Lulu's hungry.  Lulu.  Exactly.  And then there used to be a comic strip named Lulu.  It was.  And she was a short little fat thing.  Terrible.  Lulu.  By the way, comic strips are just fucking, is there a gay comic, a gay character in the  Archie comic strip?  Yes.  Hello, Archie.  They should be offended at how bad that comic is.  Because they have this gay character and how he appears in the comic. 
[01:55:30]  And it's just horrible.  Where is it?  Oh, Jimmy, you can't find the comic.  God damn the thought of me.  Memorized.  No, it was, it's so bullshitty the way it's done.  It's horrible.  It's Jughead is sitting on the, apparently Jughead is a thing for Veronica.  I don't remember.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  That had nothing to do with like him being stupid either.  He just, his dickhead was like a jug.  Just a giant Jughead of his cock like a horse.  And it had a big, and it had a handle on it like an ear. 
[01:56:00]  A birth defect.  Archie comes out.  This is how phony this is.  Uh, Archie is sitting there with the Jughead.  No, no, I'm sorry, not Archie.  Jughead's there with his crown.  And he goes, watch out for her, Kevin.  She's a royal pain.  I guess he's talking about Veronica.  Probably Veronica.  She's the, the.  Who likes Kevin.  Because Kevin's very handsome.  And then Kevin goes, she's not so bad.  I'm just not interested in dating her.  And Jughead says, Veronica's not going to let that stop her. 
[01:56:30]  And Kevin says, it's nothing against her.  I'm gay.  I guess I should just be up front.  And then Jughead's got the devious look on his face.  And he says, maybe.  But what he's thinking is, or maybe I can have some fun seeing how long it takes Veronica to figure it out for herself.  Oh, boy.  That'll teach her to make a fool of me.  First of all, that's not the way people in high school come out.  You don't just tell a guy with a fucking spiky hat. 
[01:57:00]  I'm gay.  And Jughead would have said, maybe.  And Jughead says, so am I.  Yes.  And then go under the porch.  And then Jughead says, why don't you let Big Ethel strap her on and fuck you in the shipmaker?  Or Jughead says, I hope Veronica doesn't fuck him.  She might get AIDS and give it to me.  Or it would have been great if he said, why don't you let Big Moose hang your head over the side of the bed and throat fuck you?  Remember Moose?  Big Moose.  I don't remember Moose in that strip. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, you remember Big Dumb Moose?  I don't remember.  Fucking Moose.  Moose was like the football player guy.  He was the jock?  Yeah, yeah.  He was the jock in the high school.  Why is anybody reading Archie's?  Dude, no one reads those comics anymore.  Fucking horrendous.  I miss your comic bit, by the way.  It's so dated.  Well, this is a comic book.  No, I know.  But they don't read comic books and they don't read fucking strips in the newspaper anymore.  It's such an archaic form of entertainment.  Now someone's going to call and say I do.  But in general, no one's reading that shit.  They're not funny.  They're not irreverent.  They're not anything. 
[01:58:00]  They're just waste of paper at this point.  Who's reading the fucking comics in 2010?  These guys are the most prolific comic makers, too, because they have Archie's Place, all  these fucking weird Archie's Life with Archie, all these fucking little Digest, Archie's  Digest, Veronica's Digest, Betty does a scat video, Digest, fucking Moose's Prostate  Itch Digest.  Can you read a comic today, maybe? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I know.  Oh, Monday, I'll do it, because it hurts my throat.  And he's got lines.  Oh, I have a lot of acting to do today.  Lines.  A lot.  Mr. Faber-Shout.  How about I'll call Ted, Ted by mistake?  Oh, no.  Well, Ted.  God.  You got lines with Ted Danson?  I do, yes.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, you know how it is.  He's as psyched as I am.  Of course, I bet.  I'm sure he is.  Hey, we got more info on the South Park Mohammed episode.  Remember someone called and said the rerun of that episode was bleeped to shit at the 
[01:59:00]  end?  Yeah.  Really bad, where it was like three words you could hear, and the rest of it was bleeped  for a long, extended period of time.  And we were thinking, wow, that might have been Matt and Trey, and a way of getting around  the controversy and really making fun of censorship and stuff.  Over the top.  Yeah, make it over the top.  Well, guess what?  It was Comedy Central, and it wasn't Matt and Trey.  Unbelievable.  And they thought that was completely acceptable, to completely bleep out that whole section  of the episode.  Hostage.  Yeah.  Being held hostage by a religion and threats that they have made come true in the past 
[01:59:30]  because of comic strips and all kinds of other shit.  It's ridiculous.  I don't mind Comedy Central doing this, by the way.  Wow, why?  Because I understand why.  Comedy Central, what I don't like is when they have press releases, how they don't say what  it really is.  Comedy Central is just a bunch of people running a comedy network.  They don't want to get shot for a fucking cartoonist being edgy. 
[02:00:00]  So they're probably trying to protect Matt and Trey.  I don't agree with it for politically correct reasons, but the bottom line is, Islam is violent,  and they fucking will shoot you.  I mean, it's despicable.  But they will kill you for making fun of Muhammad or their religion.  I mean, they beat their women.  So, you know, I don't want to be a shift.  That's Matt and Trey if they want to take the chance.  But the bottom line is, you know.  They're in hiding, by the way.  Are they?  Pretty much.  No one can locate them.  Comedy Central is doing this.  They should just come out and say, Islamic radicals behave violently, and we don't want our heads 
[02:00:30]  chopped off.  Just don't release a polite statement about it.  There was a website, apparently, run by these Muslims.  Yes.  And they, it was a threat.  Let's be real here.  It was a threat.  They brought up the guy that...  Van Gogh.  Van Gogh, yeah.  Van Gogh that was killed.  Dutch filmmaker, honestly.  And when you bring that up, and you say that this is unacceptable, and there are consequences,  it's a fucking threat. 
[02:01:00]  And the website also had...  It was revolutionmuslim.com.  I just want to add this in.  And the site has since been shut down after this whole thing.  Oh, has it?  Yeah.  By who?  I don't know.  But that is a fact.  The site...  But that is a fact.  That is a fact.  You have a microphone in front of you.  I never disputed it.  But, yeah, apparently, it was on the website.  And the website also printed out where they lived, their houses, where they work.  Oh, I didn't know that.  So, yeah, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  They had mat and trays and dresses on there and everything.  A lovely group.  A lovely religion.  Boy, that's how we handle everything.  We're going to drive a knife into your chest.  Yep.  Lovely group.  How about another thing closely related to this?  The Saudis, apparently, a 12-year-old girl just won a divorce from her arranged 80-year-old husband.  In Saudi Arabia.  Because under this Islamic laws and rules...  See, apparently, Muhammad, this great Muhammad, took a 9-year-old wife. 
[02:02:00]  And what they see Muhammad doing, they see acceptable in their community.  Sure.  That's great.  So, they will take girls 9, 10, 11, 12 years old.  And arrange a marriage with 80-year-old...  It was actually a cousin of her father, 80 years old.  Yes, sir?  Hopi?  I just want to know when you're converting.  I am in the process right now, and I have a ticket to Saudi Arabia.  I see your skin's getting darker.  For an arranged marriage.  In front of our eyes.  Yes.  80 and 12.  80 and 12.  Disgusting.  She actually had to... 
[02:02:30]  They did not grant her a divorce.  What they did was grant a settlement within the two parties so that it wouldn't screw up or set a precedent.  They just settled between the two parties that she can leave this marriage.  She's 12 fucking years old and arranged marriage that was, by the way, consummated.  The marriage was consummated.  An 80-year-old man.  And the Saudis find this completely acceptable.  We do business with these savages. 
[02:03:00]  And this is part of their religion based on Mohammed, who apparently took a nine-year-old bride.  It's a fucked religion.  I'm sorry.  I just...  That's my opinion of it from what I know.  And I think we're learning more every day.  The fact that we're friends with this shit country.  It's not just Democrats or Republicans.  It's all of them.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  It's all of them.  Our fucking...  Every politician we have is a...  It just sucks the cock of the Saudi Arabians because they have so much fucking money. 
[02:03:30]  They have so much interest in our country.  They have so much oil.  They have so much...  I'm so tired of that country.  Bringing it back to the South Park thing because we've got Ian Halpern on hold.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  We've got to cut ourselves short today, unfortunately, because we had so much...  How much going on?  His Highness.  His Highness.  I'm sorry we made you wait on hold, but we're going to get to you in about a minute.  Parker and Stone comment on South Park censorship.  So here's their statement, Matt and Trey.  In the 14 years we've been doing South Park, we have never done a show that we couldn't stand behind. 
[02:04:00]  We delivered our version of the show to Comedy Central, and they made a determination to alter the episode.  It wasn't some meta joke on our part.  Yeah.  Okay.  Comedy Central added the bleeps.  In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear.  It didn't mention Muhammad at all, but it got bleeped, too.  Wow.  We'll be back next week with a whole new show about something completely different, and we'll see what happens to it.  So they're a little disappointed.  That's all it takes to me.  That's not that harsh of a statement from Matt and Trey. 
[02:04:30]  That's not a fuck...  I think they understand why it was done.  I would not be surprised if they were actually nervous on some level, though.  They're mad that other stuff was being bleeped that had nothing to do with Muhammad.  Yeah, because when you talk about intimidation and fear, you are absolutely addressing the Muslim and what they do and what they use to get what they want, which is intimidation and fear.  It's not respect for the religion.  And I wouldn't...  Again, I don't mind Comedy Central doing it. 
[02:05:00]  I know a lot of those guys.  They're not going to get stabbed in the chest for a cartoon.  But just come out and say that.  Just say...  Take your battles.  Yeah.  Enough people have to say it.  We got to go with Khalid.  Khalid, Minnesota.  How are you, brother?  I was doing all right until earlier.  Salaam alaikum.  Salaam alaikum.  Yeah, whatever.  You know, I like your show and I think you guys are funny, but I think a lot of times you guys are just a bunch of dumb fucking rednecks.  We're really not, though, Kyle.  I'm from New York.  I can't be a redneck.  Why are we a redneck? 
[02:05:30]  This ridiculous fucking concept of that any religion or any group that does not fit your fucking white American view is some evil entity that's going to stab you for saying something.  They did stab...  Hold on, buddy.  They did stab Van Gogh.  And there was a threat made referencing the stabbing.  So I think we were fair to say that.  They said it, not us, buddy. 
[02:06:00]  To generalize an entire group of people.  There are millions of Muslims in this country.  Yes.  You know, there are billions of Muslims in the world.  That's why there should be a little more outcry right now about Muslim extremists by all these Muslims in this country.  But we don't hear that.  The silent acceptance is deafening, my friend.  No, that is completely untrue.  Oh, is it?  Look what you're doing.  Look what you're doing.  You're a Muslim guy, and you're calling a radio show, complaining about people complaining about that.  Instead of the outrage you should feel that these guys have married themselves to your religion and said, we're Islamic, and this is what we're going to do. 
[02:06:30]  No, this is a huge problem for all Muslims to have extremists making these claims or whatever.  But this is the vast minority.  It's like saying all Catholics fuck little boys.  You know Jesus is the real Lord.  But enough Catholics, you know what, buddy?  Enough fucking priests do fuck little boys where it became an issue.  The majority of priests don't fuck little boys.  But you know what? 
[02:07:00]  Enough of them did.  And they deserve the rap they got.  They deserve it.  So don't cry because Islam has that rap.  And a lot of Catholics came out against that, believe it or not, and were very vocal about that.  Unlike Islamic religion, the Islamic religion where you don't hear.  You're not fucking in the right places.  I'm not hearing any fucking outrage about terrorism.  I hear it daily.  Oh, you do?  Look what you're calling about.  Yeah, look what you're calling about.  You're saying that we said something.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:07:30]  How about you accept that we are stupid, we are retarded, and the reason that we are so biased  is because there are extremists that are fucking crazy.  Of course there are.  I'm not disputing that fact.  But what I'm saying is that you make the assumption, or the claim, I should say, that all Muslims embrace this attitude.  No, we don't.  The majority of Muslims are saying that, you said the silent acceptance.  Yes.  There is not a silent acceptance. 
[02:08:00]  Every day.  I'm not the most religious guy either, okay?  But if I go to the mosque, I tell you, half of the, you know, like if there's any sermon or whatever, you know, the service, whatever you want to call it.  Yeah.  You know, there is a lot of talk about how you have to break this view, these stereotypes, whatever, you know.  And there are many, whatever moderate or whatever, you know, term you want to use, you know, groups that that is the vast majority. 
[02:08:30]  Well, maybe in the United States, my friend, but how about worldwide, where you've got a country like Saudi Arabia, where it is completely acceptable to marry and fuck a nine-year-old girl in an arranged wedding.  Twelve-year-old, yeah.  A twelve-year-old, well, believe me, they've had nine-year-olds and stuff like that.  And it's acceptable because of the religion.  Well, I mean, you know, those are some issues, but the thing that's about that.  That's the best you've got on that count.  That is an entire country of people. 
[02:09:00]  But it is not an entire country.  Yes, it is.  It's completely acceptable.  And if a woman, if a woman walks down the street in Saudi Arabia, a woman walks down the street not wearing her fucking burqa, she's going to get fucking stones thrown at her.  How is that a fucking righteous and modern religion?  Hey, look, it's not a modern religion.  I mean, I'm not saying that it is.  All right.  What I'm saying is that that is not an accurate picture, that a woman does not wear a burqa against five benders. 
[02:09:30]  But it is.  It absolutely is.  They are fucking savages when it comes to dealing out discipline based on their religion.  You know what?  That is the typical fucking interpretation of what the media puts out for you.  Really?  That's me.  All right.  Kyle, hold on.  The media doesn't.  Kyle, buddy.  The media doesn't put all of it out.  In Islam.  Let's just stick with Matt and Trey and the Islamic website.  And they parody Jesus all the time. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  They shit on Mormons.  They shit on everybody.  Scientology.  They kill Scientology.  And yet Islam is seen by everybody as the religion that is going to react violently to criticism.  Right.  Or to parody.  It's the only one that is seen to react violently to parody.  I'm not talking about militaries.  I'm only talking about parody.  They're the ones who react violently.  And they always say, we are Muslim and we are doing it for this reason. 
[02:10:30]  We don't marry them to that.  They marry themselves to it.  So you call our show and say that we're redneck for listening to them?  Yeah, I'm saying that you're not making an informed decision.  I'm saying you're getting the information and we can choose to see the information we want to see.  I mean, how many fucking Muslim people do you know?  Do you know any?  No, no, no.  I've never seen them or a black person.  Not at all.  No, I don't know any Muslims.  None whatsoever.  I actually don't know a lot, but I do know some. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  And how many of them are going to get on there and say, oh, yeah, I support whatever website was calling for, you know, the veiled threat of Matt and whatever, the South Park.  None.  You know, none.  Exactly.  Not supporting it doesn't mean you're not getting up in arms about it and criticizing it.  Like Jimmy said, you called here to criticize us.  Yes.  Not to criticize the people that threatened Matt and Trey's life.  No, that's ridiculous. 
[02:11:30]  I completely think that's ridiculous.  But, I mean, that's not, you know, that's a whole different topic.  That is completely unacceptable and ridiculous.  But that's not my point here because all I hear is that, you know, the whole, and everyone's going to pick up on their own thing, you know.  I mean, everyone's got their issues that relate to them and they think that's fucking more important than anyone else's issue.  But my only thing is that the whole general statement, like, what a wonderful religion.  Yes, I said that.  What a lovely group. 
[02:12:00]  What a lovely group.  You refer to a group of people who, by religion, as savages.  I didn't say they were savages.  I did.  I said what a, I said what a, I said what a, I said what a, I did.  I, I, I, I, I, we're different people.  Yeah, yeah.  I said what a lovely, listen, dude, the thing that bothers me, Kyle, is that you're so, you're, you're not addressing both with the same annoyance.  Like, you're really annoyed that we said something that might not be nice about Islam.  Why are you, why are you, why is it the same level of disgust not in your voice? 
[02:12:30]  That, that, that, that, when he mentioned, Anthony mentioned an eight-year-old, a 12-year-old, your whole response was, well, yeah, there's some issues.  That, that's how you respond?  It's fucking awful.  But my point is that that's not the majority of people.  And in the United States, it's not, you're being myopic.  Dude, you are the one that's looking at a small group of people and judging the entire, uh, religion.  Do you know how many more Muslims there are in this world than there are in this country?  And do you know how they act in other countries is a lot different than how Muslims act in this country? 
[02:13:00]  And what I'm saying is, the way they act in Saudi Arabia and a lot of Middle Eastern countries is archaic.  And, uh, women's groups ought to be all over our country for even dealing with these motherfuckers.  But because of the oil and, and whatever other resources, we deal with a country that beats its women, fucking, uh, stones women who were raped,  marries 12-year-old girls to 80-year-old men, and it's completely acceptable and accepted. 
[02:13:30]  That's the Muslim religion I'm talking about.  Not you in a mosque in fucking Jersey somewhere.  Minnesota.  All right, but whatever, you know what he's saying.  I just picked a state.  All right, let me, uh, get Rick involved here.  Rick in Austin.  Rick!  Rick, you're on with, uh, how do you say your name, sir?  Khalid.  Khalid?  Yeah, well, Khalid.  Khalid?  All right, Khalid from Minnesota.  Khalid.  Go ahead.  Sheikh Mohammed.  I wiped my ass this morning after I took a shit with, uh, a page from the, uh, the, uh, Quran. 
[02:14:00]  And, uh, very impressive.  Dude, you're not even, I believe why you're just being nasty.  All right.  We're actually, we're actually trying to make an argument and, and, and make, uh, points here.  All right.  And, uh, that I even find stupid.  All right, well, why don't we go with, uh, Jim in Philly?  There's a bunch of people that want to react to this.  Maybe pick the wrong one there.  Jim in Philly, go ahead.  Yo, it's Jim.  Yes, Jim.  Jim.  You missed a big point, dude.  Go back to when the Danish newspapers published all those, uh, pictures of Mohammed. 
[02:14:30]  A lot of them weren't even really that big of a deal.  They went crazy.  Millions of people.  You're right.  They were nuts.  Burning down buildings.  Yep.  Uh, there was about a hundred deaths as a result of those riots.  It's, okay, setting fire to the Danish embassies in Syria, Lebanon, and Iran.  I'm reading this right from, from news sites.  Storming the European building.  Besecrating flags.  They went psycho for about a week.  How many bad apples is it before it becomes the bunch?  Right.  You know?  You're right.  It's like, oh, it's just a few bad apples.  No, it's more the bunch. 
[02:15:00]  You're, you're totally right.  Sorry, Khaled.  Yeah, I would not, I mean, I'm not disputing that there is an archaic, I mean, that the  religion has got some fucked up issues.  Don't get me wrong.  That's what I'm talking about, yeah.  That goes beyond fucked up issues, buddy.  When that many people in this time riot over a cartoon being printed in a newspaper.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  Are you, you're, you're referring to, not this event, previous, right?  Yeah, we're talking about the Danish cartoonist who, it was, uh, he depicted Mohammed, and, 
[02:15:30]  and this guy's right, I forgot about that.  There were violent riots.  Yeah, huge riots, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So, I, look, I, I'm about as American as they come, you know, and, um.  I don't know how you sound it.  Well, yeah, I mean, I was fucking born here.  But, you know, um, but, you know, the only thing is, I, you know, I'm still judged on  a daily basis of whatever my fucking name or how I look or whatever, you know, and as,  as if, um, that the whole, you know, like, uh, that, uh, exactly, like, like, my name 
[02:16:00]  or my, my, my, what I look like is some reflection that I have from, like, internal, that I support  these, um, you know, um, like the extremist issues or whatever.  So, isn't it, isn't it a bitch that you gotta live with those problems because of, uh, the  way, uh, uh, people have bastardized the religion and twisted it into a violent fucking mess?  So, why aren't you mad?  Why are you pissed at them?  No, I'm mad.  I, I am.  I have to deal with this shit. 
[02:16:30]  Well, be a little more pissed at them and instead of the people that are interpreting it  as, holy fuck, these people are violent.  Yeah.  Because, because you guys are smart enough and you know that, like, you know, fucking  some of it's good radio, too, whatever, act like, you know, whatever, like, you hate  everybody and I understand.  You don't hate everybody, dude.  I don't, I honestly, I do, I honestly, I don't hate Muslims and I'm not being polite.  I really don't.  I've had enough good interactions where I know that it's not all, we, we know that, but  you don't need to say that every time.  All right.  Dude, we gotta wrap up because we gotta eat on hold. 
[02:17:00]  We got a really busy show, man.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  See you.  I think we gave you time to make your point there.  And I hope you continue listening, you know, whatever.  He made his point and in closing, I will say he has a valid point.  I mean, I'm sure there are Muslims out there that just want to fucking go through their life  and, you know, enjoy the American way of life that, that are being judged because of what  other people are doing in other countries, blowing shit up, whatever.  But that is a problem that they have to deal with internally. 
[02:17:30]  Internally, they really need to be a little more outraged at what the people in the Muslim  religion are doing than what the people that are criticizing the Muslims are doing.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Because the perception is not good, Anthony.  Exactly.  Correcto mundo.  We have to apologize to his highness, by the way.  Yes.  His highness.  I'm sorry.  Should we?  Oh, my God.  Why should we?  Well, I don't.  We should just go to his.  All right.  Yeah.  We should go to his highness.  His highness.  We apologize.  His highness.  Hi, your highness. 
[02:18:00]  I'm really sorry.  Your highness, we apologize.  I'm really sorry for the delay today on the phones.  We're very busy, and I hope you accept our apology.  Humble apologies.  Our humble apologies, sir.  Aloha, kake, hiyaika.  Ah.  Okra Toe.  Exactly.  That's what I was going to say.  Where are you?  Ohio, gozaimasu.  He's in Ohio?  You're in Ohio.  Ohio, gozaimasu.  Columbus?  I have no idea.  Cleveland?  Where?  Akron?  What?  What's he speaking? 
[02:18:30]  He's speaking in tongues.  He got hit on the head.  Oh, he's fucking De Niro at the end of Cape Fear.  My little highness, my little.  Salamis Paji.  Yes, he's speaking Arabic, I believe.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Or Hebrew.  Sounds like Hebrew.  You know a little bit about the Arabic countries?  Ya, ora, nah.  Oh.  Hey.  Una, dimine, ten.  We get this version of him today.  I know.  On the day that we got to keep everything quick.  Look at this.  Hey, Ian. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  We saw your claim here that your blind item was indeed about Larry King when you came on  our show and said that a TV host was having an affair with a younger woman, perhaps an  actress, and that was Larry King?  Yeah, look, today they're called, there's a headline today, Anthony.  They're calling me Hollywood's Nostradamus.  Look, this wasn't difficult to see. 
[02:19:30]  Everyone knew King's wife was banging half of Hollywood on the side and King himself, man.  He's the king of Viagra.  That's all he is.  I mean, this guy, you put his highness and King on the same show together.  I'll knock this guy out in a heartbeat.  He wouldn't have a job.  Really?  You can't compare with me.  But, you know, the fact is, look, this guy, he should be in rehab right now with sexual,  sex rehab with Jesse James, Tiger Woods, and the skank he's married to, man, I wouldn't  even pay five bucks for her if she was the only fucking hooker left in Times Square. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  That's how, you know.  Wow.  That is cool.  And I assure you, Norton pretty, you know, he'll pay for anything almost, but I'm sure  if that chick was in Times Square, Norton would just walk by her.  You'd be surprised, Ian.  I'd pay for a lot worse.  You'd be surprised.  You'd give me too much credit.  You know, let me ask you guys.  I know you're a big fan of Norton, but he certainly has a weakness.  Yes, Norton's garbage.  He does have a weakness.  Yeah.  And I want to ask your female demographic out there. 
[02:20:30]  All seven of them.  If King was the last guy alive on the universe, would they jump on him and ride him?  I would have to speak for them right now by saying no.  Yeah.  Because he's really old and doddering.  I think it's time King hangs it up.  We put him in Madam Tussauds.  So you'll see no difference.  I mean, this guy, I have no idea how this guy lies.  He's boring.  His ratings are terrible, man.  His ratings are a fraction of what you guys get, you know, on the 10 o'clock slot on your show. 
[02:21:00]  Well, CNN is, they got to figure out something because the ratings are atrocious at this point.  Yeah, they were really bad for the first quarter of this year.  So I'm sure behind the scenes they're trying to figure it all out.  You know, Sue, Sue, we're going to hit this.  They can't survive if it continues.  The Grays are having a dalliance.  I mean, that's how that station works.  I've been on that station many times, and I keep telling them when they call me, don't call me, I'll call you.  I mean, when I go on there.  Wow, you come up with that?  You know, when I go on your show, for instance, people recognize me. 
[02:21:30]  They recognize my voice at bowling alleys.  I go on CNN.  I've been on many times.  Nancy Grace, Jane Velez, Headline News, all the news shows.  I mean, I can walk out of the building, walk right down Broadway, and nobody knows who the hell I am.  It's a waste of my time.  And I sell two books.  Yeah, exactly.  See?  Bowling alleys.  Yeah, I walked into bowling alley about a month ago in Ventura, and the guy giving us the balls, he recognized me just by voice. 
[02:22:00]  He said, are you, Ian, who's been on the Opie and Anthony show?  I said, hey, that's cool, man, but when I go on Grace, Jane Velez, man, I could stand in the middle of Times Square yelling and screaming, and no one's going to know who the hell I am.  Ian, thank you so much.  But enough of ass-kissing of us.  Let's get to some.  Well, my whole point is, I hope the morons of CNN are listening to this today. 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  And they fire King's ass, and they put you guys on at the 9 o'clock slot with his highness on at the 10 o'clock slot.  His highness.  Listen, Ian, I have questions for you, sir.  So is the new Archie's Comics guy.  I have questions for you, Ian, about Larry King and what you said.  On our show.  You predicted the cheating in his marriage.  Now, you did this as a blind item.  Why, if you were so sure of it, and I know you, you probably know when these stories are going to break. 
[02:23:00]  Why didn't you just break the story, and if you knew it was indeed true, which would protect you from, you know, lawsuits?  Sometimes I use blind items for one thing.  This was out of a, it was more a humanistic approach, because I knew if I would have broken this, it would have gone all over the world.  I'm in production, just finishing my Michael Jackson film.  It's coming out in 80 countries in June.  But the reason is, for me, a humanistic approach is, if I would have broken this with King's name on the record, he would have had another heart attack, and then you guys would have charged me for murder. 
[02:23:30]  Ian, you know what, it would have been great for us.  Look what happened with Jackson.  When I broke the Jackson story, everyone was laughing at me.  Unfortunately, the King of Pop, he died.  I didn't want to have another Michael Jackson on my hands, and all of a sudden, you know, I'm killing off every major celeb.  You're like the tabloid Grim Reaper.  Yeah, that's my nickname here.  Yeah, it's a good one.  You got it.  You guys got it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:24:00]  Jesus.  Tinking a word in.  And family.  Why is he not kissing his ass?  Oh, yeah, he's a father now.  Now, Ian, Ian, when are you going to, like, give us such a big scoop that our names are all over the world?  Yes.  Like Ian Halpern said on the Opie and Anthony show, blah, blah, blah, and then we're all happy.  Well, you know, if I was going to tell you about the Larry King story, you guys, you wouldn't be on the air today.  We'd all be, you know, on a deserted island in Hawaii.  Why would we if it's true?  If it's true.  It was true. 
[02:24:30]  You would have broke that story on our show.  There's more coming.  You know, I have my researchers working around the clock.  Myself, you know, sometimes I go to work.  All right, Ian.  Well, then, I want to know something about this.  You've got another blind item here that it's a member of the New York Yankees.  Yes.  Dating a Playboy model, apparently.  Yes.  And then cheating on her with an L.A. porn star.  That's right.  Now, it's not A-Rod or Jeter.  Yes.  But now, this is a blind item. 
[02:25:00]  Why not just announce it on our show so we could all bask in the limelight of publicity  and get a little ratings or whatever?  Because, again, there's a guy by the name of Georgie Porgy Steinbrenner,  who's the head of the Yankees.  I don't want to put this guy into cardiac arrest today.  He doesn't even know where he is.  Oh, boy.  George Steinbrenner, please.  Yeah, he's fucking sitting there in his turtleneck with drool on it.  I think Steinbrenner and Larry King are in a room together giving each other up the ass today. 
[02:25:30]  See, now that'll get you in more trouble.  That'll get you in a lot of trouble, you dope.  Jesus, Ian.  Oh, Ian.  Tell us the Yankee.  Right now.  Give us a scoop.  Well, take a guess.  Let's narrow it down.  Narrow it down.  Tell us field position.  I'll give you a couple of clues.  It's not Shelly Duncan.  It's certainly not Mickey Mantle.  And if you say Robinson Canoe, my answer is I don't know.  Uh-huh.  Wait, are you hinting that it could be Canoe?  Canoe, you don't know? 
[02:26:00]  Canoe!  What do you know?  What do you know on Canoe?  Yeah, I call him Robinson Canoe because up in Canada, that's all we do.  We just ride canoes.  He just goes.  Ian makes hard left turns.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  We're going down a road and Ian just cuts the wheel.  That's amazing, Ian.  Okay, I'll give you a clue.  It's not Canoe.  All right, it's not.  It's not Canoe.  Is he a starter?  Is he a starter?  Yeah, is it a current Yankee who's starting?  He's on the field every night?  There's a lot of pitchers, so you could even say if he's a pitcher. 
[02:26:30]  That's what I was going to say, he's on the field every night.  Oh, I see.  See, I was trying to get him.  So he's on the field every night?  Yes.  All right, so then it's...  Well, he's on the field.  I mean, I'm not saying he's in the starting night.  Let's see.  Oh, say, say, say, turn.  And obviously, you know, he's texting the Playboy model and the L.A. porn star at the same time.  D.H.?  D.H.?  What does D.H. mean?  Designated hitter.  The American League does it.  Yeah.  Okay, I thought it meant a demented hope. 
[02:27:00]  Wow, another left turn.  Ian, so is it somebody that played last night?  Ah.  Yes.  Okay.  But was in uniform last night.  Let's go around the horn here.  In uniform.  Let's go to the skipper here.  Okay, who do you think it is?  One shot.  I'll be honest.  If you are right, I'll tell you.  I'll admit it. 
[02:27:30]  My cousin, Phil Hughes.  Is Phil Hughes really your cousin?  Yes.  But we don't talk about it.  Man, he almost did no interview.  Almost.  I know.  We talked about it.  Very, very close.  Very good.  Well, it's not Phil Hughes.  Is it one of the newer Yankees?  Is it Bill Stevens?  Bill Stevens.  Geez, I've only heard of Darren Stevens.  Oh, okay.  It would be wished, but I've never heard of Phil Stevens.  Is it one of the newer Yankees?  Thank you, guys, Anthony.  Come on.  Granderson. 
[02:28:00]  No.  Close.  You're close.  I'm close.  All right.  Then, all right.  Well, now.  Anderson.  Right.  Grander daughter.  How about Nick Swisher?  What about Nick Swisher?  Nick Swisher.  What about Swisher?  So for close, does that mean it's close in field?  Well, you all took a stab at it.  No one was right, but the Yankees, man, they ought to follow up on the Yankees.  We're no closer than we were before this phone call.  This guy is double dating, and it's going to be a distraction.  What are they now?  Twelve and three or something, the Yankees? 
[02:28:30]  They lost last night.  They lost.  They're what?  Twelve and four?  Yeah.  This guy could bring them down.  I mean, he's going to, you know, if he keeps going on the way he is, he's dating a Playboy  model, an L.A. porn star.  Somebody's going to find out about this soon and serve the whole team.  As long as he doesn't hide her in a closet.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Never mind.  That was my left turn.  Ian, why don't you just tell us?  Because it's a blind item.  It doesn't have to be.  But you're making it a blind item. 
[02:29:00]  It doesn't have to be.  Come on.  This is my segment.  It's called His Highness Blind Item.  I hate the blind item.  Otherwise, I'm going to give it away every week.  But you'll see, guys.  You'll see.  Norton's going to be, you know, he'll be in Times Square with a megaphone in three weeks  saying His Highness was right again.  He'll be yelling at the top.  Is it an outfielder?  Jimmy, go buy that megaphone.  No, we've gone, you know, we're soon going to be going back to the 56 squad.  You're going to, you know.  Oh, well, you know what?  We've gone through the whole team right now.  This is very frustrating. 
[02:29:30]  This is part of Murderer's Row.  Exactly.  This is extremely frustrating every freaking week.  Is it Lou Gehrig?  Lou Gehrig.  Yeah, what's Gehrig doing this morning?  Is he staring at wood?  Yeah, or satin.  Not to you, Jimmy.  No, I don't.  Okay.  And I'm not going to, if you ask me if it's Joe Girardi, I won't comment.  Oh, well, he's married.  Yeah, and he also said that about canoe or canoe or whatever he wants to call.  Hey, Ian, we've got to cut it short today. 
[02:30:00]  But before we let you go, the Sandra Bullock thing.  Now, photographed without the wedding ring this week, I guess that was a big deal in  the tabloid world.  What do you got on that?  She's positioning.  I mean, when she was with James, I said clearly she was positioning day in and day out.  But now that she's without him, she's still positioning to get rid of this guy in a proper  way.  Because look, and let me ask this to Norton.  If you were married to the female equivalent of Jesse James, would you just be able to 
[02:30:30]  ditch him like that?  He's a scary dude.  What would you do, Norton?  I don't know what I mean.  I don't know.  Like, it depends on what the person knows.  I don't know.  I'm different than her in that she has a much different image to maintain than I do.  So I don't really care.  Like, if somebody goes out and blabs about what a perv I am, everybody knows I'm a perv.  It's like my stuff is not a big deal.  Are you saying it's dangerous for her to leave him outright?  Yes.  In what way?  That he might have something on her, like these alleged videos? 
[02:31:00]  I think it works both ways.  There's two things here.  He's scared of her.  And also, she's scared of what he's going to say.  Jeez, I have somebody here who's giggling in bed right now.  Oh.  Can we hear the giggling?  Put him on the phone.  That's fucking funny every time.  Love that old gag.  Funny every time.  She doesn't want to say hi.  Of course not.  We didn't think she would.  How about just a noise to prove that she's a female?  Can you believe me?  Can you give a noise to prove it? 
[02:31:30]  Hello?  All right.  Oh.  There you go.  This fucking Ian is a player, man.  There you go.  I don't know what it is.  What the fuck, Ian?  Ian, Footer wants in.  You frustrate a lot of people every week.  Footer, you're on with Ian Halperin.  Wow.  Hey, this is an honor.  Your Highness, you are the man.  What you've done here today is unbelievable.  You're actually telling us that there's a successful Major League Baseball player banging two hot girls?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I mean, guys, crazy. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, this is big shit.  It's big shit.  That's smart.  Footer, we understand how big this news is, and we're on it with the AP right now.  Yep.  We're typing up a little story.  Your point's well taken.  I agree with you.  Your point's well taken.  Nice man type story.  And when this goes to Breitbart, my voice is probably going to be part of the clip that they play.  Yes, of course it is.  Is that your mom?  All right, guys.  Yeah, this is a Breitbart moment, isn't it, Ian?  I think so.  Well, Ian, anything else before we let you go, sir? 
[02:32:30]  Again, Opie, when does the baby do?  Any day.  Any day.  It's Teixeira or Nick Johnson, by the way.  Why?  Because Teixeira apparently was texting two girls, and Johnson is close to Granderson because  he's one of the newer Yankees that are out there.  So, man, Johnson's not even hitting his weight.  I don't even think he's hitting his shoe size.  I think I ought to get rid of this guy.  And let me tell you, Johnson, after his first stint with the Yankees, he came to the Montreal  Expos, the old team where I'm from, my hometown. 
[02:33:00]  You know, the guy was hitting like a buck fifty.  I have no idea why he's back in the Yankees' fold.  Come on.  There's got to be someone out there that this team can afford that could do better than  Joe.  It's ridiculous.  He could be the guy that brings down this.  Since we're going to talk sports, why do you think that Anderson Silva did what he did?  Oh, fuck.  I have no idea.  Oh, sorry.  Wrong line.  Yeah, now we've got to move on. 
[02:33:30]  We've got Dana White on the phone as well now.  We're backed up today.  I'm sorry, your highness.  Peace out, guys.  And again, everyone, have a great day.  And I'll be thinking of all of you today while I'm at work here.  Goodbye, guys.  Nick Swisher?  Yeah.  Swisher?  That's what Eastside Dave is saying.  Yeah.  Peace out.  Oh, he's not answering.  And did we learn anything today?  No.  Are we closer to any real fucking gossip here today?  It was fantastic.  I think one of Ian's better appearances, the breaking news that came out of that call, Opie. 
[02:34:00]  It should be around the world by 10 o'clock this morning.  We're actually going to have to just listen to the tape over and over again to just kind of dissect everything he said,  because there was so much info there about so many celebrities.  Unbelievable.  Dana White is on the phone.  Of course, the main man at the UFC there.  Dana, I've been following your Twitter.  I love following you on Twitter, and you get excited over, like, childish things, and I appreciate that about you.  Yesterday, you were tweeting that you went and saw Kick-Ass, and you also tweeted that you're in Sacramento, 
[02:34:30]  and you found out that they have a Pinkberry, and that just made you so happy.  Yeah.  I had a rough week this week, so when I got here, I went to Pinkberry, and I also found out.  Do you know who the mayor of this city is?  Who?  Where are you?  Kevin Johnson.  I'm in Sacramento.  Wait, who?  Sacramento?  Kevin Johnson.  Do you remember KJ?  He used to play for the Phoenix.  Yes.  Of course I remember KJ.  When you tweeted that last night, I'm like, so? 
[02:35:00]  The guy's name's Kevin Johnson.  It's the Kevin Johnson that used to be in the NBA?  That's exactly what happened to me.  My PR team, when I landed, said, hey, the mayor, Kevin Johnson, is going to be at the press conference.  I'm like, oh, that's cool.  The mayor's going to come.  Kevin Johnson.  Kevin Johnson.  What were his qualifications to become mayor?  He was an NBA star.  Actually, he couldn't be a cooler guy either.  I'm sure he is.  Very cool.  Just a little strange, though.  Hey, did you like Kick-Ass?  Well, in California, you got Kevin Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sonny Bono. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  Clint Eastwood you had for Carmel.  Clint Eastwood.  Yeah.  And you wonder why the state is broke.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, Jesus.  You just explained it perfectly.  Kick-Ass.  Did you like it, Dana?  Yeah, it was really good.  I liked it a lot.  Anthony thought it could have been a little better, but he did enjoy it.  I did enjoy it.  I thought it was quite novel.  I liked the, of course, anytime kids curse and do horrible things, it's hysterically funny. 
[02:36:00]  I love that shit.  But yeah, I think there were parts of it where I could have used a little more action.  Hit-Girl made the movie.  Hit-Girl was the best.  Yeah, that was just fucking hysterical.  She's kicking ass.  Literally.  How annoying would it be if we wanted those radio shows?  So, Dana, do you promote that type of behavior from children?  Don't you think it's a bad influence on the channel?  Shut up.  That's a dumb question to ask me.  Yeah, exactly.  And finally, what do you get at Pinkberry?  Because I've got a Pinkberry in my neighborhood. 
[02:36:30]  Jimmy goes, too, I believe.  I certainly do.  Yeah, what do you get at Pinkberry?  The original with Fruity Pebbles.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  You need a fucking tougher answer than that.  I think we need to hang up right now.  I like a Care Bear and some Fruity Pebbles, please.  With some gummy bears.  I like gummy bears and Fruity Pebbles.  Wow, was I not expecting that.  No, not at all.  It's funny, too.  Jesus.  You know what I love, too, on Twitter?  The day they smashed the fucking media for not liking something you said. 
[02:37:00]  You're like, well, then don't fucking follow me.  I love that.  Yeah, that's perfect.  Well, you know what?  Yeah, actually, when I was in Abu Dhabi, when I was all pissed off about the Anderson Silva thing,  you know, the media was starting to write stuff about what I was saying on Twitter.  If you don't like Twitter, then get off the fucking, it's not for you.  It's for the fans.  How great is that, though?  That's how the media deserves to be talked to.  You know, if they don't like it, then fuck you.  Don't follow me.  Well, you know what?  There's so many of these, you know, so-called media people who, you know, just, they'll take any stupid thing 
[02:37:30]  and just turn it around and just start writing, you know.  It was somebody, one of the writers on one, it was actually one of the bigger, bigger websites.  I don't remember which one, but started saying, oh, he's going on a slur-filled tirade because  I said fuck or something, you know what I mean?  And just making bullshit up. 
[02:38:00]  Stay off my Twitter.  Yeah, well, it's like they forget that they use profanity, too.  And the fact that a guy curses or is pissed off about something, it's not news.  I mean, you know, you drop the F-bomb, and they're like, oh, do you hear what he said?  It's like, same thing you say.  Exactly.  And I like Fruity Pebbles.  That's the F-bomb.  Really.  Do you have a double helping of Fruity Pebbles?  Because you're entitled, you're entitled, I hope you know this, to two toppings.  You sure are, Jimmy.  Sure are.  That's funny. 
[02:38:30]  What an odd, what an odd, I would never have guessed that at Rifle Pop.  I usually go strawberries and some kind of like chocolate chip thing.  That's it.  I'm having Jesse Ventura kick your ass.  It's funny.  Whenever I have my girlfriend run into the Pinkberry for me, she's like, what toppings  do you want?  I'm like, yeah, just get me whatever you want.  And she comes back with crushed glass on it.  Taxes or something, right?  Yeah.  I like that you said that Twitter's for the fans.  Yeah.  I don't have time for the haters on my Twitter.  There's plenty of places where haters could go, but not on my fucking Twitter. 
[02:39:00]  It's all about the fans and having a good time with this damn thing.  Yeah, the funny thing about haters on Twitter is people go on there and tell you how bad  you suck.  And they're like, what the fuck are you doing on my Twitter?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You hate me that bad?  You're actually hanging out on my Twitter to talk shit?  With their three followers.  Hey, let's get into it, Dana.  This WEC thing tomorrow night's going to be great.  We had Faber on the other day.  He told some great stories, man.  Great stories.  Yeah, he's awesome. 
[02:39:30]  The main event with Faber and Aldo is going to be a great fight.  Uriah Faber held the title for two years.  The kid's the most dominant featherweight in history.  Jose Aldo, this kid hasn't been beat since 2005.  And his last six fights, he's won by knockout.  Wow.  He wanted, you know, Uriah Faber is an icon here in Sacramento.  He wants him.  Jose Aldo wanted to fight him here, wanted to fight him in Sacramento. 
[02:40:00]  This place is going to be sold out tomorrow night, and nobody's going to be cheering for Aldo.  Now, I'm a little confused.  I mean, I'm still very new to the MMA.  I'm not going to lie to you.  So why don't you take a fight like this that everyone's talking about and put it into a UFC pay-per-view?  Yeah, no, people ask that all the time.  And bottom line is, you know, when we bought the UFC, there's 155 up to heavyweight.  But when we first bought this company, the 155-pound didn't exist either then. 
[02:40:30]  We created a title for it back in the day.  And there's so many more weight classes that we could have brought in, too.  We bought the WC.  These guys had the best lighter fighters in the world.  And we put this thing on versus, got a TV deal, and it's pretty much the way that it worked out.  People keep asking us, when are you going to mold it into the UFC?  But we've got a great deal with Comcast and versus, so I don't see it happening anytime soon.  Would you allow the guys to go back and forth?  Like, say Penn wanted to, I mean, I guess the weight class, he did have to go to UFC. 
[02:41:00]  But if Penn wanted to fight Faber at, say, 155, I guess they'd have to fight the UFC.  But what if Penn wanted to go down in weight and fight him there?  Would he fight him in the WEC?  It's happened.  You know, Jens Pulver moved down to weight and went down to the WEC.  Manny Gambarian, who was fighting on Saturday, was on the Ultimate Fighter.  You know, he's in the WEC.  And also, there's too many, I guess if you have every weight class, there's too many decent fighters. 
[02:41:30]  It's almost like you couldn't get everybody in.  It's almost smart to have two leagues.  It could.  It's just, you know, the other thing is, too, there's still weight classes that we don't even have yet.  So you could do it.  And I'm not saying that it couldn't happen in the future.  But as for now, we're happy where we're at.  Why is Chuck not fighting Tito?  This season of the Ultimate Fighter, some stuff happened during the show.  And, you know, that's a big question. 
[02:42:00]  You've got to watch the show.  Oh, it hasn't come out yet.  Yeah, he obviously knows.  But it's better to not say anything because it's going to be revealed in the Ultimate Fighter.  Well, some of you have to promote the pay-per-view, right.  Right.  And we give the edge to Faber because he told a story on our show two days ago where he took on a whole town.  When he fought Indonesia.  He went to Indonesia and he ended up fighting the entire town.  So I'm thinking he's going to beat Aldo now. 
[02:42:30]  Advantage Faber.  It's going to be a good one.  One of the things that I love about this fight, too, when you talk about these guys that, you know, neither one of these guys are a safety first fighter.  And to be honest with you guys, after what happened in Abu Dhabi, you know, I've been miserable for two weeks over that whole thing.  So I'm actually glad that we have this fight right now because our next fight is until May 8th, the Shogun the Cheetah fight up in Montreal.  So I'm happy to be getting this fight because, listen, the last thing I want to do is oversell anything right now.  And I'll tell you, I'm confident this is going to be a great fight tomorrow night. 
[02:43:00]  When during the Silva fight did you get extraordinarily aggravated?  I wasn't happy in the second round.  I wasn't happy.  But then by the time I got to the fourth round, I literally got up, walked over to his manager, came up to the belt and said, you can put it on him.  I'm not doing it.  And then left the arena.  Walked out.  What is he doing?  I don't understand what he's doing.  We still don't understand.  We've discussed it with a bunch of people.  What is Silva doing?  Is he mad at you for something?  Like he feels you're not giving him the level of competition? 
[02:43:30]  What is the guy's problem?  Yeah, I'm with you.  I wish I could, you know, sit here on your show today and give you a full explanation of why that happened.  And what he was doing, I have no idea.  I got mad that night.  We did the press conference together.  Then we went to my room and we talked for 45 minutes.  And, you know, I literally got nothing out of him other than, you know, he said he was sorry and it won't happen again.  And have you threatened, I've heard you threaten to fire him if that happens again.  If you feel like he doesn't perform, you fire him? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  No, listen, the big difference between, if he doesn't perform, you know, there's times where fighters go out and, you know, you have extremely talented guys who go out and it's just not their night.  Right.  I don't mean that.  They can't get off.  They can't pull the trigger.  He was acting like a lunatic that night, you know, doing the things that he was doing, going down on one knee, slapping the canvas, telling him, you know, screaming at Damian Maia to fight, but then would run away from him when Damian Maia started the fight.  It was just so jumping behind the referee. 
[02:44:30]  I mean, just crazy, crazy shit.  Yeah, all right, we'll see what happens as we move forward.  Hey, off my Twitter, Graham Cracker 4, what's your thoughts on the Strikeforce Brawl the other night?  Um, you know, it's not good.  It's not good for the sport and I think that, you know, a big reason it happened is from the top down, you would never see that happen in the UFC because we control who goes into the octagon before and after the fight. 
[02:45:00]  You know, you don't just let fighters that want to go running in there because they want to jump on TV, you don't let it happen.  First of all, Jay Shields, the odds for this kid to win that fight, you know, it was like a Rocky story.  If you ask a thousand people, a thousand people would have told you Dan Anderson beats Jay Shields.  Jay Shields, not only that, Strikeforce is so stupid, these guys let his contract expire and he was their champion. 
[02:45:30]  They basically bet that Henderson was going to beat him.  Um, then even the commercials that these guys put on, uh, were only of Dan Henderson, not of their champion, Jake Shields.  So Jake Shields goes in there and dominates the guy, right?  Right.  Then, uh, is having his moment on, on CBS to, to do his interview.  And, you know, you got Mayhem Miller running in there.  Hey, give me my rematch.  Do you think they're just doing something to get some kind of something noticed or get some kind of attention because UFC is just kicking the shit out of them? 
[02:46:00]  No, I don't think, I don't think they did that.  I don't think they did that.  You believe it was real.  They're Bush League.  Yeah.  They're a Bush League.  First of all, these guys don't belong on CBS.  You know, everybody knows that.  They're, they're a small Bush League show and, you know, that's what, that's the kind of stuff that happens.  Right.  Okay.  And yeah, Rogan explained the cage is locked down after the fights and it's all very controlled.  So that type of thing just doesn't happen. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  You get guys all upset because they want to walk in there and celebrate with them.  You can celebrate back in the locker room.  Right.  You know, you don't need 50 guys.  You know, you get that many guys.  And plus, most of these camps consist of a bunch of other fighters, you know?  And, uh, like I said, the Diaz brothers have taken a lot of heat for that fight.  But to, but to be honest, Melendez and Shields were the first ones.  I mean, Jay, uh, Jay Shields is the one that pushed them.  And then a big fight starts off.  And let me tell you what, fight breaks out next to the Diaz brothers. 
[02:47:00]  I don't think there's any secret in what's going to happen.  You know, those guys are getting in it.  So you think that might've hurt Strikeforce more than helped it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know what?  I don't think, as far as Strikeforce goes, listen, been in this thing for 10 years, man.  Me and my partners bought this company.  When nobody cared about this thing, it was dead.  It was going out of business.  We believed in it.  We bought it.  My partners pumped in millions and millions and millions of dollars to get this thing going.  With no guarantee that this was going to work, right? 
[02:47:30]  Do you think when we're trying to get sanctioned in New York and Ontario and places like this,  you think CBS, Strikeforce, or Showtime care whether we get New York?  Do you think they've spent $1 or $1 to help us get into New York, Ontario, Germany,  or any of these other places?  They could care less.  You know, these guys are the me-toos just trying to jump in this thing because they think there's money in it.  When bad stuff like that happens, we're the ones that are going to have to spend the time, energy, and money to fix it.  Right, trying to repair it.  Yeah.  All right, buddy, we got to, let's give the big plug. 
[02:48:00]  This is a fight that I'm really, really psyched about.  I'm buying.  Yeah, I'm actually on tomorrow, so I'm going to see it.  I think Jimmy and I are watching together.  Ooh.  We're going to check it out, yeah.  Romantic.  Yeah, I actually, I don't know.  Faber Aldo, come on.  I want Faber, but I am not convinced he's going to win.  Aldo is very, very dangerous.  And we'll get some Pinkberry, Jimmy.  Yes.  Jesus, Dana, man up on your freaking toppings, will you?  Oh, my God, man up a little bit.  Have a steak, would you?  That sounds delicious.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Pebbles does sound great.  It does sound great.  It's just a name that's a little bit, a little awkward. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, it's like, what do you do?  Well, the cast of Will and Grace and I like to feed each other Pinkberry.  Nobody would expect that out of you.  Got to man up just a bit.  Jesus.  So 10 o'clock tomorrow.  It's in Sacramento.  It's your eye-favorite hometown against Jose Aldo.  And is it a 10 o'clock bye on the East Coast?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Same as the regular UFC pay-per-views.  Okay.  Good.  All right.  Well, we're looking forward to it.  Thanks for the support as usual, guys.  I appreciate it.  We'll see you soon, Dana.  Thank you, Dana.  Take care.  Bye.  Dana's the man.  Yeah, he's honest. 
[02:49:00]  He always tells the truth about if his fighters were annoying him, he says it.  And you know what?  I have military friends in Abu Dhabi, and I actually texted Dana personally, and he set  up the whole ticket thing for these guys.  He's unbelievable.  He didn't have to do that.  I would.  He could have passed it on to somebody else.  He said he took care of the whole fucking thing.  And put them, their seats were right behind Dana.  Right behind Dana at the fucking venue.  No, I can't text Dana.  He doesn't give me his number.  The problem is they were the enemy.  Al-Qaeda.  Imagine.  A couple of my friends. 
[02:49:30]  He's all confused, scratching his head, like, wait a minute, what the fuck's going on  with this guy?  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Mary Carey, I'm sure, is here by now.  And Robert Schimmel might stop by.  How do you know he was in the building?  Yeah.  We've got a fucking busy show.  Jesus, busy show.  And we've got to talk about the sun.  We have to talk about the sun sometimes today.  S-U-N.  S-U-N, of course.  Yeah, it's up there in the sky.  It's scary as shit when you think about it.  So I tell you one thing. 
[02:50:00]  All right, let's go to break.  No ice cubes at that thing.  Open ending.  Warning, 6 to 11 Eastern on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Mary, uh, Mary, Mary Carey, uh, making her way into the studio.  As she, uh, walks down the hall, Derek came up with a Best Cry Ever remix.  You want to hear it?  Our own D-Boy, Derek?  D-Boy!  Oh, let's hear it.  Where's D-Boy's, uh, shitting audio? 
[02:50:30]  We haven't played it yet.  Oh, my God.  Is that fantastic?  That's worth another play.  Fucking task.  Why would they not have that in front of me, man?  Let me get a few plays out of the D-Boy shitting thing.  D-Boy's shit should be right in front of Opie.  I think you're right, Ed.  Maybe it is.  Maybe I don't see it.  Anyway, here's D-Boy's, uh, Best Cry Ever remix.  You got a war face?  Ah!  That's a war face!  Now let me see your war face!  You don't scare me! 
[02:51:00]  Work on it!  Yeah.  See how simple this dumb thing is?  Ah, it's great.  And then, of course...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, yes, Daddy.  You got, uh, you got D-Boy's poopies?  Yes, I got it.  This is so bad.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  It's funny every time.  Oh, fucking children.  He gets all excited for that middle part. 
[02:52:00]  He calls it the bullfrog.  Yeah, it's the bullfrog.  He names him?  Hi, Mary.  Mary Karrion Studio.  Hi, Mary.  Hey, I gotta tweet that shit.  You're on Twitter, right?  I tried to find you guys on Twitter.  You can't find us?  Hold on.  I gotta get a nice shot of that cleavage for everybody.  You're easily found.  One, two.  Look at that.  I looked up Opie and Anthony, and I didn't see...  Opie Radio and Anthony Comia.  We'll, uh...  Oh, no. 
[02:52:30]  We'll write it down for you.  Because I'm following Steve.  Yes.  A lot of gay bars following you.  God damn it, you're looking good.  Thank you.  We haven't seen you in a while.  I know.  It's been a couple of years.  Well, last time I was supposed to come, I...  You know, rehab obviously hadn't worked at that point, and I drank too much, and I overslept  and didn't make it here.  Oh, God.  Now I'm sober.  Oh, that's right.  Are you sober?  Yes.  We want to get into that a little bit, because we watch Celebrity Rehab, and now Sober House  as well, and you were a part of both of those shows, right? 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  Luckily, my season wasn't as crazy as the new season.  I don't know.  Your season was pretty good, too.  Because you guys were all worried about...  Seth.  Yeah, Seth.  Our little crackhead.  He was doing crack on the roof.  Yeah.  And, you know, Dr. Drew had to show up with a camera and get him off the roof.  Of course.  But he had to make sure the camera was there.  Of course.  We're confused by the show.  We really are.  We don't know if Dr. Drew is exploiting you guys for good TV.  Is he helping and exploiting?  Like, what's your take on this whole thing?  You know, I think, especially with my...  I was the first season of Celebrity Rehab, so I definitely feel he helped us, because he 
[02:53:30]  didn't know it was going to be a hit.  He didn't know the outcome.  So after we filmed the show, he actually still met with us.  Every Thursday, we could all get together and talk.  He was available.  You know, he called his office.  He always called me back.  But I think as the show went on to be a success, the producers started wanting a lot more,  you know, drama.  Like, I'm convinced that the producers of that show would love it if someone, like,  died of, like, withdrawals or OD.  I mean, they brought Jeff Conway back because he was so great.  I remember when he had a seizure on our first season, the producers were, like, high-fiving 
[02:54:00]  each other.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So, you know, I think that now it's turned into more exploitative.  And, you know, Dr. Drew's not a psychiatrist.  And he's an internal medicine doctor.  He is, right?  Is he really?  Yeah.  He actually used to work.  I don't know if he still does it.  He did rounds, like, a friend of mine was, he was his, her ER doctor at Huntington Memorial.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So.  Because he has a stethoscope.  What does a stethoscope have to do with, you know, addicts?  And he gets so into the psychiatric part of it now when he's not supposed to do that. 
[02:54:30]  You know, he actually has a psychiatrist he brought, he brings on, Dr. Sophie, who I  actually still see now weekly.  And he's amazing.  I mean, he's an amazing psychiatrist.  Right.  And, you know, he doesn't always agree with everything Dr. Drew does.  We were talking about you a lot the first hour of the show because Celebrity Rehab and  Sober House, you were conflicted.  You were trying to get out of porn.  You were trying to, you know, get sober.  And then we noticed that you went back into porn after Celebrity Rehab for a little while.  Yeah, I did one movie and it was really.  It was hilarious because we were looking at it. 
[02:55:00]  The guy who listens to Dr. Drew.  He does.  He has Celebrity Pornhub with Dr. Screw.  You know, right.  Dr. Screw.  You know.  How lucky they found a doctor with a name like Drew.  I know.  With Dr. Screw.  Mike Corner.  He did a good job.  But, you know, it was kind of.  When I first did Celebrity Rehab, I stopped doing, at the time, my website, I stopped doing  everything.  Right.  Because VH1, you know, was like, keep staying, you know, keep doing the right thing.  We'll give you more shows.  And I really, I wasn't sure how I felt about porn anymore at that time. 
[02:55:30]  You know, I was 27 and I started when I was 21.  So, I was kind of like, maybe it's time to change.  But then after a couple of years, you know, VH1 does pay you to do the shows.  But I was like, I need money.  This isn't enough, you know.  Just because I'm not doing porn, you know, doesn't mean like all the mainstream opportunities  come.  The porn thing is still there.  Right.  And it is a bad stigma to a lot of mainstream people.  Yeah.  And I decided to do the movie.  I only did a girl-girl scene, which, you know, in like porn world, that's not much  of anything.  Wait, you didn't do a scene with the guy who looked like Dr. Drew?  No, no. 
[02:56:00]  No.  I couldn't have sex with Dr. Drew.  Dr. Screw is just kind of a creep, almost like a cuckold.  He kind of watches the action and he has like a chart and a clipboard and a pen.  He writes on the chart and tells them, I don't think this is good for your rehabilitation.  The girls go, shut up, doc.  And they keep getting fucked.  You're the worst doctor ever.  So wait, now, are you married or do you have a fiance or what?  I actually got married last July.  We knew each other for seven weeks and we got married.  That's cool.  At least you fought it out.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it working out though? 
[02:56:30]  You know what?  It is going.  It's actually going really well.  He's really great.  He's here.  You guys should say hi to him.  I just want to back up.  We hate boyfriends and husbands.  We don't know what to say.  We'll have him in a little bit.  Yeah, he's sweet.  Did Dr. Drew see your porno?  You know, I know that he said some comments to TMZ about it.  Was he mad?  His wife was way worse.  His wife went on Twitter saying like, because of me, her kids are going to need psychiatric help.  Oh, please.  Mrs. Screw?  I don't know. 
[02:57:00]  She said that she was the one who fought so hard for me to get on the shows.  And if it wasn't for her, they wouldn't have had me on the shows.  Yeah, right.  You're great because you can speak.  And I cry a lot on the shows.  So that's always good.  It leads to one more question about it.  And then we can obviously move on to other things.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Huh?  I like talking about it.  No, I know.  But we've got other stuff we want to cover.  Oh, okay.  Like, I mean, when you were going through the celebrity rehab in the sober house, you were  obviously, I go back to the first thing I said to you.  You're conflicted about what you do next because you don't want to do porn forever. 
[02:57:30]  No.  And it seems like...  What was that, you guys?  I'm looking at...  I hadn't seen this, but you have a little hat on.  I was a nurse for a nurse group.  Oh, a domination role.  I do.  A domination role.  I don't want to look at my vagina.  Why?  Why?  It's plaus-worthy.  We do.  We do.  Who's that you're with?  Lexi Tyler.  Wow, she's a lot.  Yeah, she's really...  She's got a finger pop, huh?  Yeah.  We were friends and we kept laughing, though, because we were really good friends for years  and we hadn't had sex with each other ever.  Really?  It's always...  It's actually easier to work with someone you're not friends with. 
[02:58:00]  Sure.  Because when you're friends, you kind of laugh.  Yeah, I know.  Me and Jim sucked each other off.  We just...  We all smelled like onions.  I'm like, ah, it's true.  Laugh.  But what I want to say, most porn stars, there's nothing else for them after porn.  You're...  I think you're an exception to that.  You know, thank you.  No, I really do, because you've got such a great personality, and where do you see yourself  going?  Well, you know, it's funny, because for a while, especially on Star Wars, they didn't  show up, but they gave us all opportunities to figure out what we wanted to do. 
[02:58:30]  And for a while, I thought I wanted to get into stand-up comedy, because I'd done a show  on Playboy TV, but then I realized that was an improv show, and stand-up's maybe not  the way I want to go, but I definitely wanted to see me with comedy.  I just got a part in, like, a little SAG movie that we start filming next month.  Of course, I'm playing a porn star in it, but...  It's funny.  You know, yeah, and I finally have a mainstream agent, so, you know, I've been going to castings,  which I was joking with a lot of my girlfriends that are just, you know, mainstream, struggling  actresses.  I'm basically one of them now.  Right.  Your cleavage is killing all of us, by the way.  It's killing us. 
[02:59:00]  It's good, though.  It's amazing.  It's good cleavage.  It's amazing.  So, wait, you're doing...  You're in a movie, a SAG movie.  Yeah, it starts filming End of May.  It's called Hollywood Method.  I don't know much about it, because they haven't fully casted it.  I was, you know, I got lucky when I went for the casting.  Dan, you can turn this.  I'm talking to Mary, and I love watching her eat pussy.  It's not that it's bad, but it's like...  Well, it was weird, because I didn't know what my friend's pussy ever looked like before,  and it was a lot different than I was expecting.  Well, not as good, huh?  Well...  Come on, it's all right. 
[02:59:30]  I don't know what I mean, because I love her.  Ah, fuck her.  What was wrong with the pussy?  Was it smelled a little weird, or...?  You know, well, she's had the surgery on it once.  To have, like, the lips shrunk?  Yeah, it was a lot bigger than I thought it would be.  It's bigger?  Like, you guys want to show hers?  Yeah, let me see.  But that's not...  That's me.  That's nice.  You do have a nice one.  Wait, you took a...  Is that a candy cane?  I think it was a candy cane dildo, maybe?  She didn't want to use any of the toys, either, so it was kind of...  Oh, fuck.  So she was a terrible fuck, basically.  She's a friend. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, ha, ha.  Good friend, bad fuck.  She's a nice girl.  Yeah, exactly.  So her pussy was really big.  I hate badge reduction.  I like it big.  Really?  That looks like a badge that's been fucking worked on.  It bugs me.  Yeah, that's hers.  She's got a big clit, too.  Yeah.  Why would you fuck with that?  Like a weenie.  I didn't know it was good, because the rest of her looks so good, I didn't know when I  took the underwear off.  No, but I like that.  Why would you shrink that?  Oh, you want to...  It's awful.  I could get the ears off a Dumbo.  I was looking at the website where you could see what it looked like.  You please, Tammy?  Oh, wow.  Jimmy likes, as you said, very big, sloppy lips.  I like the type of pussy that she actually has to zipper her pants, like with her ass  barged down so she doesn't zip it up. 
[03:00:30]  I don't know.  Look at that, though, dude.  That looks like Rocky's eye before Mickey cut it.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  That's pretty...  Oh, my God.  That's a horrible shot.  I hate vag surgery.  I hate...  I think instead of abortion doctors, that's who should be shot.  The guys that shrink vaginas.  I like it big, for real.  I don't even know how they do that surgery.  I don't either.  It's just a terrible weed whacker.  There's no reason.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  She just had a baby, so I wonder what happened now.  And she had a baby?  No, she just did, like, two months ago.  Oh, that vagina's just a mess.  Oh, you guys speak of who had a baby. 
[03:01:00]  Do you guys remember Tawny Roberts?  Yes.  She's had a baby.  She's the one that ran out crying?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I was telling my husband about that.  I played it for him, because it's something on YouTube.  That's one of the funniest things ever.  Which one was it?  Because we've had a few.  Mary was a trooper.  She just was crying, and you...  I told her, if you take your headphones off, nobody can hear you.  So she thought she was talking to me privately, and I remember I pulled the mic in.  You were bad.  You were on our side.  You know, I did that with her a lot.  The greatest thing about her as my best friend was that she, since she wasn't very smart, 
[03:01:30]  you know, she pretty much was, like, just my hot blonde friend that I could bring,  I'd be like, okay, we're going to go to this, we're going to do this today, this today,  you know.  Yeah.  She did everything I said all the time.  Yeah.  She a good mother, you think?  No, yeah, her kid got taken away.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know, I mean, and I hate to say this, but...  How was the kid?  Only a few months old?  You're old?  Now he's two years old?  Two years old?  Two and a half.  Yeah, when she had him, you know, she was, like, six months pregnant, and she flew out  to see me.  And before she got on the plane, she's like, I'm going to get trashed in first class.  I'm like, you're six months pregnant.  Holy shit.  They're not going to serve you. 
[03:02:00]  She's like, I'm going to wear all black and tell them I'm fat.  And sure enough, she was drunk when I picked her up at the airport.  My friends who were with me refused to hang out with us.  She continued drinking at my place, took Xanax.  Someone came over with, you know, Coke, so she's doing Coke, and eventually the next  day I kicked her out.  I'm like, you got to go.  This is crazy.  But then I forgave her, and the next day she picked me up.  Well, because she was so sad, and, you know, she cries a lot.  What a selfish bitch, though.  She's a selfish bitch.  Oh, no, it gets worse.  She picked me up in a limo that her, you know, that her hooker client, that's what she married. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  She married her hooker client?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what she was working out.  Yeah.  Is that healthy, Jimmy?  Yeah, that's a good way to be.  You're never going to have problems with substance abuse or cheating?  No.  That's good.  Well, she had, like, a driver drive us around all day because I had meetings to go to  and stuff, and she's drinking champagne, doing Coke.  I was at my dermatologist's office.  I'm like, have you guys seen my girlfriend, Tawny?  They're like, let's go look for her.  They find her in the bathroom.  They're like, she's got to leave.  Holy shit.  She's such a sweet girl.  I don't understand why she's so troubled.  She's selfish. 
[03:03:00]  So she married this guy.  Yes.  Are they still married?  Yes, but, you know, it's hard.  I don't really talk to her much anymore because the last time I talked to her was, like, a  year ago.  You know, she's buying a plane ticket to meet me in Fort Lauderdale, and she's in the  switching planes in Charlotte, and she starts calling me, what gate do I go to?  I'm like, look at the little monitor.  She's like, you can't call the airport for me and find out?  I was like, no, Tawny, this monitor is.  Just find it.  She is a dunce.  She's selfish.  I told her, I'm like, whatever you do, don't drink, just go straight to your gate.  Well, of course, she got drunk. 
[03:03:30]  I heard her board the plane.  I heard her ask the pilot what time she lands.  I get to the airport to pick her up.  People are walking.  I don't see her.  I start asking people, have you seen this blonde girl?  Really pretty.  They're like, really big lips.  So apparently, I guess she got her lips done.  Oh, Christ, man.  They said she got arrested.  Apparently, she called the flight attendant's names, and she got arrested and taken off the  plane.  You know, ever since then, I haven't really talked to her.  What a dope.  You know, she's just fucked up.  So she married, now this hooker client, what kind of work does he do without saying his  name?  What kind of work does he do?  You know, he was doing, like, investments or something with finance, stock. 
[03:04:00]  Did he think she was going to be faithful and that knocking her up would make a quote-unquote  honest girl out of her?  No, I don't, I don't know.  I don't think they meant, that was another funny thing is, because she had met him and  was traveling around the country with him, and then, like, three months later, she told  me she was three months pregnant, so obviously she got pregnant right away.  Oh, there she is.  I do.  I must say, she's a pretty girl.  Isn't she pretty?  She's not pretty enough to tolerate that fucking nonsense.  And I've never seen a girl pop a baby out, and her body was, like, right back to that.  Honestly, with Joanna, Danny, I may change my opinion. 
[03:04:30]  It was crazy.  Oh, yeah, she has a nice, tiny little pussy.  I don't like her.  Third lips.  Oh, my God, she's so young there.  So, um, so she's just a troubled drinker.  And had the baby taken away, what happened?  She got a husband.  Her and her husband got in a fight, and I guess she said that he was hitting her, and apparently  if both people claim domestic abuse, they can take her baby away.  That's it.  Oh, good one.  Wow.  But I think the baby's with, he's so cute, too.  I mean, he has ten fingers, ten toes.  He seemed fairly normal.  On each hand.  Not bad, because she was drinking.  Well, you. 
[03:05:00]  For the pregnancy.  Yeah, really.  Why do you think she's a bad mother?  I, you know, I don't, I don't necessarily think that she's a bad mother.  I think that she just needs to get herself together first, before she can become a good  mother.  So, because I definitely think she loves her child.  You know, I just think that maybe because she, maybe she wasn't in love with the guy  she married, so.  Oh, you don't think it was, you think it was financially motivated?  I think possibly, yes.  At least we know it wasn't us, really.  Yeah, it wasn't anything too bad, because whenever I say that about our, she gets mad.  Yeah.  She's just fucked up.  Yeah, a lot of people were mad at us that she ran out crying. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, but I mean, I mean, freaking Mary Carey was, Mary's a trooper.  She was an instigator, man.  That was, that was a great day.  But Mary knows she's a bit of a nut.  As far as radio goes, that was a great day.  Oh, it was so great.  I tell everyone about that story.  I'm just, you know, what's going to happen, though, is one of her fans always hears me  when I do interviews, and they're going to tell her, and then she's going to call  me drunk later, and be like, ew, and she's going to start, you know, leaving me messages.  Why didn't she stop drinking?  She told me she was going to go to rehab, and then she called me and asked me if I could get her  on Celebrity Rehab, and, you know.  Are you watching Sober House?  I am, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  You like it?  I just think it's so crazy, you know.  It doesn't seem to be much, like, obviously, I know they have treatment going on, because  you see Dr. Drew three or four times a week.  They don't show it.  They like to show the drama, but I don't, I'm glad I'm not living with those people.  The house mom, Jen, is crazy.  You know, I didn't.  You dealt with her, right?  She, yeah, she was my old sponsor, actually, before she was on Sober House with us, and,  um, she's, you know, she's a really nice girl.  She's definitely got her own issues, too.  You know, she's, I don't know if she necessarily should be running the house, but. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, we played some of her audio this morning.  Oh, you did?  What kind of audio do you have?  Well, uh.  Is it funny?  It was pretty funny.  Because I didn't see the last episode, because I was.  No, you probably saw the episode with Mike Starr, the guy from Mouse and Chains.  Yes, I mean, one thing.  And she was following him over and over.  Why was she following him?  And going, clean your room, clean your room, clean your room.  That's what we played.  But what do you mean she has her own issues?  Is she, like, is she a fucking mad?  She's a recovering addict.  Well, she's recovering, yeah.  How long, though?  Um, listen, I think she's got three years now of sobriety, but, um.  Yeah.  But she did a long time in rehab, and, but, you know, she's.  Are you sober for, I'm sorry to interrupt you, are you sober for real? 
[03:07:00]  I mean, I'm sober now.  Okay, I'll be, like, two or three months sober, and then I drink.  I, I, I went to Peoria a couple weeks ago to host a party.  I decided to drink with my husband.  That's a no.  Yeah.  That's a no.  We drank, and it turned it out, it turned out really bad.  The next day, I was throwing up my whole plane ride home.  I couldn't even, like, get the bag.  The plane started taking off.  I couldn't even get the little bag out, and I threw up on myself.  Oh, shit.  It was horrible.  So you're considering a presidential run when you're 35?  I would like to run for president.  It's hard to stay sober, huh? 
[03:07:30]  Don't you think that there's enough things that they can pull up for the campaign that  you might not need to add anymore?  Hey, she's white.  Cut my vote.  What do you, what do you, why don't you just get sober?  What are you doing?  No, I, I am, and that's the thing.  And after I drank last time, I was kind of like, you know, because they always say in  a, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.  And that is what happens to me.  I was hosting the party.  So I've gotten to where I can do my feature dance bookings, which I'm in town for now.  I can do those sober, because I'm busy doing the show and stuff. 
[03:08:00]  But hosting parties, and I'm just sitting there, and I was in Peoria, they were like,  come on, Mary, drink.  And I thought, you know what, I guess I can have just a couple.  But a bottle and a half of, I don't know, the stuff called Nuvo, whatever it was.  A couple of bottles.  Yeah, I was very sick, so, you know, and it turned out very bad.  My husband and I ended up having a fight.  Apparently, police came.  I woke up in another hotel, not the one with him.  He woke up like, where are you?  Wait, did you wake up with a guy?  No, I was by myself in my hotel room, but, you know, we were both kind of like, he's  like, where are you?  We had to, you know, like, that's what happens when we drink, so. 
[03:08:30]  Does he want you sober, or?  Yes, and you know, he actually is staying sober, too.  I mean, he, when he drinks, he gets mad at me, so.  Well, that's good, though, that the two of you have each other.  Yes.  To both collapse at the exact same moment, because they say that two negatives always make a positive  in a sober relationship.  So, that's scary.  Wow.  That would be me.  I'm going to be in trouble.  Yeah, no, it's good.  But, Mary, how bad is it to throw up?  I don't want to eat on a plane.  How bad is it, because you're taking off in the elevator? 
[03:09:00]  Oh, my God, I don't normally ever throw up, either, and I, you know, it was, I threw up,  like, I'd just eaten two yogurts and a bag of Doritos, and three of us.  Oh, wow, that had to look great.  Those are great for a hangover, too.  Like, I would think that those would be very good in your stomach.  Yeah, yeah.  While flying.  Oh, and I kept throwing up, then I, like, I was good the rest of the plane ride.  I had a ginger ale.  As we were landing, I had to jump up, and I threw up again.  Right.  Then I'm like, okay, I'm all good on my cooking plate.  I'm going to have a veggie burger.  Sure enough, I landed in the next city.  I threw up the veggie burger, so.  So, that's what happens when I drink.  Wait, from Peoria, that's Illinois, back to L.A.? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, well, they had me fly from Peoria to Vegas, Vegas to L.A.  You're a big star.  Hey, they were.  Big star.  They let me fly, I like to fly American.  I got to fly American there on the way back now.  Non-stop, let's go.  Non-stop for Mary Kay.  Yeah, I agree.  Mary doesn't fuck around.  Why were the, uh, why were the police called?  Uh, we, I guess we were loud, um.  Oh, that's what happens.  We had, like, you know, six months before that, we decided to drink, and, um, he got mad at me,  threw a burrito at me, so I guess the cops call.  I think I call the cops.  Is that what they call fucking these days? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Throw the old burrito at me.  I'm going to throw a burrito at you.  Lay down.  Well, the funniest thing is when the cops question him, they're like, was it a frozen burrito?  And he's like, no.  I guess that's a difference.  Yeah, I guess frozen burrito.  Yeah, one is harder.  Yeah.  One is a misdemeanor.  Yeah.  The other one is.  Do you prefer sour cream with you?  They were just hungry.  I don't know.  Neither one of us remember the fight, so, you know.  Couldn't hold up in court because somebody ate the evidence.  So, you, um, so, wait, you guys, what were you, you don't remember what you were fighting about?  Nope.  Nope.  All we know is that we took the ride that gave us back to the, you know, I guess, back to the hotel. 
[03:10:30]  I was mad at him, didn't get out of the car.  I went back to the club where I hosted the party.  Apparently, he just, like, ran back in there and found, you know, the owner.  I drank some more, and then I guess I took a taxi all by myself.  I don't even think I went with anyone back to my hotel.  I don't know how I got, like, how I knew where my hotel was.  And, um, then we had a fight, apparently.  Apparently.  So, I was told.  You're a blackout drinker, then.  Oh, yeah.  When I drink, yeah, that was, like, that, you know, that was one of the reasons I knew I needed to go to rehab, you know. 
[03:11:00]  And that's why when I got offered celebrity rehab, I was really happy because.  Do you flirt with guys and stuff like that?  Does he get, like, is he a performer?  No, no, no, no, no.  He's, like, a normal electrician in the union.  So, does he get jealous about your, uh, sex, your sexual history?  Um, you know what?  I don't, I don't think so.  Once, you know, he obviously doesn't want to look at the DVDs.  Or if I, like, start talking about, oh, she's hot.  Who is that?  Sorry.  Don't, no, don't distract me.  Um.  Blondes and big boobs always distract me.  Um, yeah, he, you know, he doesn't obviously want to watch any of my movies. 
[03:11:30]  If I, if I bring up, like, guys I've, like, slept with, or, you know, sometimes I'll be a, just annoying bratty girl.  And if there's someone on TV that I hooked up with, I'll see something.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know.  Guys don't want to hear that.  Do you talk about, uh.  Now, again, the, the threatening part of a porn girl is the fact that she's fucked guys with a lot bigger dicks who do it for a living.  Like, you know what, the whole porn sex isn't that good, I don't think.  Why not?  I don't know.  I mean, it's kind of, like, not comfortable positions.  Like, if you're on top, you can't, like, really grind, you have to go up and down, which I don't like as much. 
[03:12:00]  And if the guy's on top, you have to, like, keep one leg open, and. . .  But that's positioning.  The guys themselves, if you were just alone with them, would be able to fuck you a lot better than they could on film.  I mean, the one thing is, I mean, and the sex just goes way too long when you're shooting a movie.  I'm, like. . .  I'm just always, like. . .  I mean, I feel like I'm, like, doing a marathon.  Like, trying to, like, keep. . .  You've got to keep yourself sounding like you're into it.  When really you're just, like, I'm so tired, you know.  But, like, once I remember I'd, like, zone out, and I'd be like, wait, I've got to make noises.  You know?  Like. . .  So, because it's just too long. 
[03:12:30]  Have you had those discussions where you're, like. . .  Where he's, like. . .  Where he's just quiet after sex, and he's, like. . .  Do you, you know. . .  Like, where he, like, starts, like, you know. . .  Talking about porn dicks, or. . .  Like, you don't be, like, worried about it.  No, he has a really big dick, though.  Oh, really?  Okay, good, good, good.  Yeah, it's really big.  That's good.  It's very helpful.  And the thing is, we had a. . .  Like, when we met, we kind of had sex with him, like, the first couple hours of meeting each other.  He was really aggressive.  Wow.  And, yeah, like. . .  It's called a rape.  Well, you know, it was funny, because I was. . .  Like, Brittany Sky introduced us, and I just. . . 
[03:13:00]  When he came over. . .  Like, the night before, Brittany Sky and Ryan were. . .  We were in Vegas, and at 3 in the morning when I was drunk, I was like. . .  I'm horny.  Doesn't your boyfriend in L.A. have any guys we can call for me?  So, that seemed like a great plan that night when I was drunk.  But as we flew back to L.A. . .  I was like. . .  I'm sick.  I don't want to meet anyone.  And he came over, and he just, like. . . .  Within a couple hours, was, like, grabbing my boobs.  And I was like, whoa, you're aggressive.  And next thing I know, he had sex on my friend's couch.  You're really aggressive. 
[03:13:30]  Hey.  Yes.  And the next day, I mean. . .  He kind of was just very aggressive.  The next day, I remember. . .  I told his friend and my girlfriend. . .  I'm like. . .  He's really aggressive.  I don't know about this guy.  And then. . .  We went on a date the next day, and then. . .  I really liked him.  Where'd you go on a date?  Went to actually Saddle Ranch.  Just, like, bar in L.A.  To watch the Laker game at the time.  And he had never heard anything about me.  So, he thought it was really weird when people wanted to take pictures of me in public.  Oh, hey.  You sure you didn't know who you were, though?  Because you were introduced by a. . .  He knew I'd done porn.  Oh, okay.  And he actually, like, Brittany Skye's a bit of a whore. 
[03:14:00]  So. . .  Nice.  He was like. . .  He even told his friend, like, if she's anything like your girlfriend, like, I don't want to meet her.  Did he fuck Brittany Skye?  No.  No, no, no.  He wouldn't ever.  She's a whore?  Well, he doesn't like her ankles.  He calls them cankles.  I hate cankles.  Fat ankles.  Here, look her up.  Look her up.  Let's see if she can.  Big fat ankle.  It wouldn't prevent me from fucking somebody.  Just don't look down.  Yeah, exactly.  Just don't look at them.  You'd have to have bad cankles for me not to fuck you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I mean. . .  Um. . .  I don't know.  Brittany. . .  Brittany is a little bit bad. 
[03:14:30]  You know, your namesake is getting fat.  What?  Oh, Mariah?  Mariah's pushing 200 pounds.  No way.  Came out today, yep.  Is she really?  Yep.  Oh, poor Nick Cannon.  She drinks a lot, though.  Oh, she is.  And alcohol. . . .  I mean, for me. . . .  When I was drinking a lot. . . .  I gained weight.  And when you stop drinking. . . . .  You lose weight.  Nick Cannon must be miserable.  He marries Mariah Carey.  She fucking bones.  Oh, that feels to your ankles.  She looks . . .  That's a couple years old.  They're saying she's gained 57 pounds since being married to Nick Cannon.  I don't . . .  Wow.  I don't believe that.  That's what they're saying.  I mean, the picture looks like she's definitely . . .  Actually, I do.  Can we see the picture?  After we see those fat ankles? 
[03:15:00]  It's over there.  Well, she's really tall.  She's my height.  How tall are you?  5'9".  I'm almost 5'9".  There's no picture.  Oh!  There's a little bit.  See, apparently she avoids posing where you see your ankles.  Yeah.  Yeah, apparently.  I feel bad saying that.  But she's . . .  I don't think she used to have . . .  She's a fat-ankled whore.  Why would you feel bad about saying that?  What about right there?  Might have something going on.  Yeah.  Let me see.  You kind of see.  There's not much cat . . .  That's still like a really old picture of her. 
[03:15:30]  She looks really good there.  Was she an ex-fatty?  Did she used to be a fat girl?  No.  No.  Big fat ankles.  She's very pretty when she . . .  I mean, she showed me her pictures when she was a little girl.  She has cankles.  There's nothing worse than fat ankles on a woman.  See, she's covering them there now.  Maybe Mariah Carey got fat from eating M&M's.  I get it?  Because she fucked them.  Did she?  Of course.  Yes, she did.  Yes, she did.  Yeah.  He allegedly pissed on her.  He was the first celebrity to really track me down.  And when I talked to him on the phone.  M&M?  Yeah, it was actually after the 2003 AVN Awards. 
[03:16:00]  2004 AVN Awards.  I had lost Best New Starlet.  So I was crying.  And I was crying.  And one of the ladies from New Sensation came over to me.  And she's like, I'll cheer you up.  And I was like, nothing will cheer me up.  And she's like, you know who Marshall Mathers is?  He wants to meet you.  And I was like, I don't believe you.  Get him on the phone.  And he got on the phone with me.  And I was like crying.  I was like, why do you like me?  And he's like, because you look like my ex-wife and Mariah Carey combined.  I don't know if that's a compliment, though.  But, you know, I was very excited. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, my.  Holy shit.  Oh, my.  What's your name?  Fat body?  His name is Mariah Carey, sir.  Oh, wow.  Holy mackerel.  April 15th of this year.  Oh, what a fucking moose.  But you know what I will say?  She looks really young.  She looks way younger than 42.  Yeah, because her skin is stretched.  There's no wrinkles.  That's the secret.  She stretches the wrinkles out.  Yeah.  She looks very young.  She looks like she's only 29.  Here's what's dangerous.  She's packed into this dress.  And she has, like, that in between the upper panties. 
[03:17:00]  And she has, like, middle chest fat.  Oh, wow.  That doesn't even look like that.  Like ribcage fat.  It doesn't.  I don't believe it.  I just have a tongue-in-the-art to look, see.  Oh, yeah.  She's, like, a close look here.  So, um, wow.  I want to see this Brittany Skye's fat ankle.  That looks great.  Oh, is that Mariah Reesalations?  Whoa.  Yeah, she's, uh.  Aw, poor Mariah.  She's so sexy.  I've had to go fuck her.  You know what, I think that she's gonna, I think that she's gonna lose it again.  She always goes up and down, so, and I do, too. 
[03:17:30]  She'll get it back.  I don't go that up, but I've definitely gone up and down.  What do you mean, poor Nick Cannon?  Come on, you marry Mariah Carey and she puts on 57 pounds?  What's that whole thing about?  I think it's just because she drinks champagne all day, honestly.  What is she drinking out of a fucking chocolate-covered strawberry?  What a fatso.  No, but maybe if she drinks, like, five bottles a day.  Wow.  Let's see, her ankles look good there.  Let me see her ankles.  That's before she got all the tattoos on them.  Oh, she got tattoos of things, like, or buildings to make them smaller?  No, her ankles are covered in the tattoos. 
[03:18:00]  Of course they are, just the colors.  She's just trying to cover it up.  I'm gonna have, like, two angry former porn stars when this thing's over.  Tawny Roberts and Rudy Skye are gonna get together and come after me.  Wait, Tawny doesn't do porn anymore?  No.  She's still married?  Yes, I think so.  I don't know.  Are they L.A.?  No, they're in New Jersey.  You guys should have her on, actually.  I don't know.  We're in Jersey.  She would love to come on.  Yeah, we would.  She hated us, Tawny Roberts.  She won't remember she hated you.  Oh, my God.  She won't remember.  No, she would call me up sometimes so mad at me over something because I'd say something on an interview or something.  And then, like, three weeks later, call me up loving me. 
[03:18:30]  Then, you know, she hates me.  Then she loves me.  Do you think...  Now, I know you don't know, but do you think that she would have sex with people outside of her marriage?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, her husband had told me that she had, so...  What, was he mad?  Yeah, I think he was.  Yeah, a little mad.  Do you think that she would do it for, you know...  For you guys?  Compensation?  Oh, definitely.  Oh, good girl.  Oh, definitely.  Oh, that's getting there.  Okay?  But not...  It doesn't look bad, though.  They don't look that bad.  I don't know.  You guys should have asked.  They do look bad.  That's my husband.  He was on those ankles.  They're terrible.  Those aren't bad ones, though. 
[03:19:00]  They look like fucking Vic Tayback's fucking wrists.  But maybe that was before she had her babies.  You want to talk to Mary Perry's husband?  Yeah, let's talk to her husband.  I love Mary.  It makes you feel nervous.  It's funny to me.  Really?  Yeah.  Why, he's a union guy.  Yeah.  He never did any of this stuff.  And, like, the guys at work called...  Union guys scared the fuck out of me.  Hi, Mario.  What's up, brother?  He broke his arm.  How'd you break your arm?  He doesn't know.  Is that the guy who woke up throwing up the next day?  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  On the job.  Which mic you got on on there? 
[03:19:30]  Seven.  You look cute, Mario.  Oh, thank you.  I told her about Bernice's guys tangles.  Mary's been a lot big.  She has really big angles.  We're trying to find a picture.  We can see that they're a little fat, but she seems to hide it well in photos.  It's like she has four knees.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wait, let's show Mariah.  Hey, Mario, look.  Yeah, Mariah.  This will be me when I'm 42.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's not good, right?  Holy shit.  She looks like Joy Behar.  Yeah?  Wow, she fucking does.  Yes, that's it.  No, she's still gay.  Yeah, she does. 
[03:20:00]  She does.  Nah.  Well, Joy's pretty, but she's a little heavier.  A little older.  A little heavier.  So you knew Mary did adult films, but you had never really seen her work and stuff when  you guys hooked up?  Well, my buddy called me.  He said his girlfriend, Brittany Skye, had a friend for me to meet, and I told him.  I said, I'm good.  You know, your friend's a little bit on the dirty side.  Your girlfriend?  Yeah.  Or your girlfriend is on the dirty side.  I'd rather have...  No, I'm good.  He called me again.  He said, my girlfriend won't see me unless you come over.  To meet me, I guess.  I didn't know that happened. 
[03:20:30]  I didn't know she said that.  Why do I not get these calls?  Look, I need you to play wingman with a porn star.  Yeah.  So I told her, you know, I said to her, so I looked her online, and she looked good,  so I, you know, I went and saw her, and then she was really aggressive.  No, you were the...  You were the aggressive one.  No, you know...  He claims that I kept, like, saying, pull out your dick, but I don't think...  No, she was sitting on my lap outside, and she says, do you have a big dick?  And I said, of course.  I don't remember saying these things.  Oh, of course not. 
[03:21:00]  I'm pretty confident, though, to say that to a girl that does porn.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, I would say, well, you know, like, eh, it's probably better than you expect, but  you're not threatened by her, by her, by...  Like, do you ever compare yourself, like, fuck, like, she slept with this guy, that guy,  and, you know, it's hard not to.  Not really, because, I mean, I have confidence, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, I have to please her.  If I don't please her, she's going to go somewhere else, so...  I have to force him to have sex sometimes, though, because I'm like...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I like to have sex all the time, and he's like, I'm tired. 
[03:21:30]  I'm going to work in a couple hours.  I'm like, you just lay there, you know, and...  Well, I work at five in the morning.  At two in the morning, she wakes me up.  I want your dick.  I'm fucking sleeping, baby.  I love you, but I got to be up in two hours.  So then I throw a temper tantrum.  So just lay there, yeah, lay back and let them do the work.  Yeah, I try to do, but then, you know, I have to turn around.  I have a little fun.  You know, even last night, he's like, we have to get up in a couple hours.  I'm like, I don't care.  He's like, fine, whatever.  And then once you get started, you're like, why was I even arguing?  He has.  Exactly. 
[03:22:00]  I want his side of the Peoria story.  Yes.  What happened in Peoria with the blackout and the cops and separate hotel rooms?  We drank three bottles of this.  Yeah, a bottle of half each, basically.  So all I remember is we left and she wanted to have sex and I was wasted.  I want to sleep.  So I woke up and the cops were knocking on the door and they said, hey, you guys are being  too loud.  And she, they took her outside and took me inside.  They talked to us and according to our witness, he was getting aggressive with the cops. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, my little agent was there.  But I mean, honestly, I really do not remember.  I woke up and my wrist was swollen.  Seriously, it was swollen.  And, uh, you know, I went to a doctor and they said, I have a broken bone.  Four months in a cast.  You think you punched a wall or something or hit it?  Well, you know what?  I asked the doctor what it could be.  He said, usually when you fall, this is what happens.  But I'm a big guy and this is, this bone is like an inch and a half thick, you know?  So for that to crack in half, I had to do something.  Yeah.  I had to do something bad. 
[03:23:00]  Wow.  All for sick.  All for they said no to sex.  You know, if you said yes, none of this would have happened.  So it's very a handful.  Two handfuls.  Yeah.  Yes, you can see.  No.  No, she's fun though.  She's, she's fun.  Yeah.  We see the very fun, uh, silly side of Mary.  You know, she's really nice.  We love having her.  Yeah.  But I guess after a few drinks.  Well, yeah.  Well, after a few drinks sometimes she gets to be, you know, like a 15 year old brat.  Uh-huh.  I mean, you know.  Oh, damn.  She said she pointed out guys on TV.  And then, you know, just to be kind of.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's something that happened.  I mean, it's like to listen to some rap songs anymore. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He didn't like the Yankees for a while.  Oh, please, I hope it's only Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So did I.  What?  Yeah.  Why couldn't it be country western, Mary?  Why rap?  Can you name one of the guys?  Tim McGraw or something.  Oh, yeah.  Can you name one of the guys she pointed out on the TV?  Uh, oh, yeah.  You know what?  Melky.  Melky.  Melky Cabrera?  Well, you know what's funny is this rapper called her probably like four months ago.  And, uh.  The Melk Man delivered.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:24:00]  I said, hey, let me answer this phone call.  You know, because I was actually a fan of the rapper.  You know what I mean?  Right.  So, you know, I know they used to date before, whatever.  So I answered.  Wait, you knew they did or didn't, though?  No, I did.  I did.  I answered.  We can't say his name?  Oh, you can say it.  Yeah.  Exhibit.  Alvin.  Alvin.  Exhibit.  Yeah.  So, anyways, I answered the phone.  How the fuck are the exhibit?  And all I hear is breathing.  I'm like, hello?  Oh, damn.  Just hung up the phone.  Oh, shit.  And he just lost a fan, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Really? 
[03:24:30]  All he had to say was, hey.  He put the horrible picture of him.  Don't forget.  Find a nice picture.  He's a shame.  Find his mug shot.  Hey.  Do you think he was jerking off?  I think he was about to until I answered.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, damn.  Oh, that's a bad picture of him.  I know, I know.  That's disappointing.  Okay.  He doesn't look like that now, you guys.  Don't show me that.  What a heart on killer.  You want to talk to sexy Mary and you hear, hello, I'm a big fan.  I don't know.  Can I have tickets to your concert?  Yeah.  So, yeah, he probably didn't know.  Did he know she was married or not?  Oh, yeah, he did. 
[03:25:00]  Somebody asked.  Yeah, he was late.  Like, the first month we were dating, he kept calling and stuff.  I just didn't answer.  Why didn't you just tell me you were married and you couldn't hook up anymore?  I think I eventually did tell him.  Well, I told him I would play for him.  I think some guys just don't care.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  You know, I mean, if she's going to cheat, she's going to cheat.  I'm not, you know, I mean, what can I do?  Right.  You know, I mean, I just got to do things right.  Kill me.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the rules in porn can be different, though, because sometimes, again, if you're not  doing films and you're not doing them, but sometimes the rules are different because,  all right, if you sleep with a guy and he's considered a client, it's not bad. 
[03:25:30]  If you do it on film, it's not bad or something?  I believe that none of those relationships, though, when the girls are having sex with  other men, that it's never going to be healthy.  Right.  And if you think about it, I mean, in porn, we call them the suitcase pimps, that the  guys that generally with girls who are having sex with other guys don't have jobs.  A lot of times they're drug addicts.  And if you think about it, those are the only type of guys that are really going to put  up with their women having sex with lots of different men, you know, or the suitcase  pimp guys.  You don't really see a porn star actively doing porn, you know, dating a guy with a 
[03:26:00]  nice job who has good money.  You just don't see that, you know?  Porn stars generally are dating losers.  Well, the porn stars don't really want to date guys like that, though.  Well, because no regular guy is going to put up with that, you know?  They might in the beginning, and after a couple months, they're going to say, I don't want  you having sex with other men.  Right.  And I do believe, like, you know, there was only one time where I was, you know, in a relationship  and did movies, and it totally, you know, the day I would do a movie, he would be like,  I hate you.  You're a whore.  He'd come home for three days later. 
[03:26:30]  You're a whore.  I hate you.  And then when I get paid, I deserve that money you just got because I let you do that, you  know?  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  And that's, you know, and when you're a girl in that situation, you think, well, this  is the only guy who's going to deal with this, and you don't want to be alone.  At least I was like, I don't want to be alone, and I just got used to having him around because  he dealt with it.  Right.  And it wasn't healthy, you know?  It turned horrible, and then I got abusive, and then I left him.  And you guys got married after seven weeks.  Seven weeks.  We're on, like, 11 months now.  Ten months.  We've been together for 11 months, and we've been... 
[03:27:00]  And just one broken hand, you know?  That's not bad, right?  Broken hand, vomiting on a plane.  Yeah.  That's what happens when we drink together, you know?  Why did you guys feel the need to get married after seven weeks?  Um, well, I just felt...  Well, I always do things, like, kind of crazy.  Yeah.  I just felt like he was my soulmate, and that we have a lot of fun together, you know?  Yeah.  Everything we do, we have a lot of fun, and I don't know. 
[03:27:30]  Eh, it's a big cut.  Well, you know, it's like a best friend.  You know, you have a best friend you can have sex with, and you can enjoy it.  I do.  My dog.  You know what I'm doing?  So, it all worked out well, though.  It's going pretty good.  Do your friends must think it's pretty cool, though?  Because your friends are mostly, like, just union guys, right?  Yeah, yeah.  All electricians.  Yeah.  Well, the guys that work...  Yeah, it's so fun.  I was in a union.  So, Mario, how's the wife doing?  You know?  Do you have any pictures today?  Let me see your phone real quick.  You know, I show them one titty picture, and they all pop a boner.  I get overtime.  You know, it works out well.  Well, are they... 
[03:28:00]  Do they ever, like...  Because you know they have to go probably watch your stuff after they know you.  Oh, they have.  I'm sure they've jacked up.  But you don't care, right?  Well, you know, I mean, all I care about is don't touch.  You can look all you want, because she's a beautiful woman.  What do you expect?  Don't touch!  You know, just no touching.  That's all it is.  I don't think his parents like the fact that they didn't point.  Oh, no.  Really?  My mom thinks that our house is like a whorehouse.  She's banging herself as soon as you walk in, and there's dildos lying.  Well, there's dildos lying around for some reason.  There's a lot of porn everywhere, too, unfortunately, but...  You know, my mom's very, like... 
[03:28:30]  Is she religious?  Uh, I don't know.  What national are you, Italian, Spanish?  I'm Cuban.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She's very straight-edge, you know?  And she just thinks that she fucks herself everywhere.  You know that marriage is having sex everywhere she goes, and, you know, she told her we're going to Hawaii in July, and she goes,  You know, Mario, this is a child hotel.  You can't be in a jacuzzi at night.  Like, really, mom?  I don't know what she thinks.  Wow.  Yeah, they, um, you know, in...  Like, we invited his little brother to my friend Kendra's house for, like, a Thanksgiving party, and his mom was like, 
[03:29:00]  Are there going to be girls running around naked at this party?  What kind of party is this?  You should have told her, look, according to Dr. Screw, I'm doing very well.  Yeah.  So she knows you're not really doing films, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they're happy about that, you know?  Look, your son's a big success.  You married a poor star.  Oh, that was a good impersonation.  I like his Cuban mom. 
[03:29:30]  Now I like Cubans a lot.  I didn't really...  Before, because I grew up in Florida, I always saw Cubans as, like, coming in a raft, because  when I was like...  Oh, no, growing up in Florida, the news when I was a kid, when you were 10, 11, 12, 1990,  91, was always, like, these Cubans on a raft, on an inner tube, you know?  And I made my best friend from high school, we were joking with him.  Like, I picture them reaching for land, you know, Cubans.  And now I love Cubans.  When I find out someone's Cuban, I like them more.  Look at you.  You are in love.  You seem to have a pretty cool vibe about you, like, you're comfortable, you're not, 
[03:30:00]  you know...  The only thing I don't like about him is he rushes me all the time.  Like, today, he's like, you're running late.  It's like, I wasn't running late.  I was, you know, perfectly on time, but he is always on time, and I'm always running late.  That's every guy with girls, though.  Yeah.  But I'm really fast at getting ready, you know?  Yeah, you think you are.  Yeah, she's in her own little bubble.  Yeah, girls think they allow it.  Because they get away with it.  We can't get away with it.  If you have to be her at nine, she leaves at nine.  It's like, bullet fucking time.  Well, not for interviews.  Only for, like, stupid things I do that.  Yeah.  Like this?  No, this is far out of the show.  This should classify as stupid things. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  No, this is totally fun.  Yeah, we kind of fall between stupid things and waste of time.  No.  Well, obviously, a lot of people like to listen to you guys.  I know.  I don't know what's wrong with them.  It can't be that stupid.  I've got to go.  I've got to...  Yeah.  Where are you going?  I'm shooting something today, but I've got a 10-15 pickup outside.  Oh, what are you shooting?  Can I be in it?  I need to cross over and mainstream.  I would love to be in it.  It should be up.  Yeah, it's a one-episode thing.  Is it comedy?  It is comedy.  Why don't you write me stand-up and I'll do it? 
[03:31:00]  Well, I'll have to do it in stand-up.  Oh, well, then, okay.  You got to go, Jim?  I have to 10-15 pickup.  I'll take over his job if you guys want to, you know...  Yeah, we're just fucking around today.  It's a nice Friday show.  Yeah.  Keeping it light and fun.  Hairy.  I have to shoot...  Topless.  I mean, what?  Yes.  One of my guns.  I'm going to go to the range.  Yeah, it's going to be shooting guns all the week.  I just want to leave early.  Oh, yeah, of course you do.  No matter what I was doing, you'd have to do it, too.  I got to get surgery.  Me, too.  Me, too.  I got to go.  I got a car waiting.  10-15.  Are you doing radio anymore? 
[03:31:30]  Like what?  You did Playboy radio for a while, right?  Yeah, you know, I had my own little show for a while, and then I got Sober House, and  you know, Playboy wouldn't allow the VH1 cameras in there, which I didn't understand  that.  You would think that...  What the hell?  That's good exposure.  I know.  Because the magazine's not selling worth the shit.  You think the Empire could use the...  Oh, Playboy's in a little trouble, don't you think?  Yeah, and...  With all this free porn.  What do you think of the free porn on the internet?  I think free porn's horrible, you know?  I mean, because I, you know, I...  You're like Lars with Implant, man. 
[03:32:00]  I just, I feel like it's not really fair to, you know, the performers out there.  Because as it is, performers really don't get paid appropriately, and...  But then again, I feel like these days, like, any girl can...  Like, there's no, like, standards for getting into porn now.  I feel like there's just so...  And there's so many girls that go in, and then they're done in six months, and...  How do you feel that Max going to jail and Stiano on trial?  I don't think that...  I don't think Max went to jail.  No.  Because, you know...  That's crazy.  It's freedom of speech, and who's to say...  I mean, that jury could have watched one of my Girl Girl movies and been like, that's 
[03:32:30]  obscene, you know?  And he's...  Obviously, the girls' signed release forms are of age...  Adults!  And, you know, there's a reason I never worked with Max Hargur, because I didn't want to  do that.  As a girl in the industry, you know going into it, which, you know, it's not as if...  Yeah.  It's saving Private Ryan, basically.  He's not sweet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, if you're a girl, they tell you, you discuss what's going to go on.  They know what they're getting into.  They got paid extra, probably, to do it.  If a girl doesn't have a problem with it, I don't see why the government...  Well, Staliano's on trial, too. 
[03:33:00]  A butt man.  Yeah, I heard about that, too.  A butt man.  A butt man in trouble?  Yes.  I mean, in trouble.  Dude, he spent over $2 million in legal fees, because they found one of his things obscene...  I think they got him the same way, which was the...  When they ship it, yeah.  Ship it.  And the line of Max Hargur, he didn't even...  Max Hargur didn't even ship it himself.  It was a third-party distributor that shipped his movie, yet he's...  The distributor went against him in court to get rid of their charges.  That's so fucked, man.  Come on.  Yeah, I read a lot about that case.  How long was he away for? 
[03:33:30]  Four years.  Four.  I think it was supposed to be...  Originally, he was facing, like, 50.  That's insanity, man.  Disgusting in this country.  That's insanity.  No one is talking about...  The fact that Staliano is on trial right now...  It's ridiculous.  ...for his life, and they're actually going to go to trial over the summer.  This guy just makes adult pornography using adults for adults.  Exactly.  And this fucking government is going to throw him in jail.  It's sickening.  What do they got on him?  I don't know.  I don't know the story.  It's probably the same thing.  Some scumbag was offended and then ordered it on purpose just to get him.  Gotcha.  It's funny.  They won't show...  They won't do Chris Hansen catching fucking potential pedophiles, because that's entrapment, 
[03:34:00]  but they feel going after adult porn guys is fucking acceptable.  It's fucking a sick thing.  It's a sick thing.  It's a whole adult song.  Speech!  Speech!  Sorry.  I'm fucking making a speech.  I gotta go.  Bye, Mary.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  So, Ted, where I said hi, I will, and I'll say hi.  Sheckler, I meant...  Oh, yeah.  That's what I meant, too.  He's doing lines with Ted Danson today.  Oh, wow.  Have fun.  Ted Danson.  Ted Danson, yeah.  I'll talk to you soon.  Ted Danson's playing.  How long are you in town for?  Until Sunday.  I tried texting you, but I don't know if I have a single name for you. 
[03:34:30]  You don't like me anymore.  Oh, Jimmy, what's that about?  Because I didn't have Steve's email anymore, so I was, like, you know, writing Steve on  Twitter, and I'm like, wait, I texted you, and no one got back to me at first.  No, I've been doing...  I've been shooting a lot in the last couple weeks, and then I actually mentioned Mary's  and then I knew you were coming on, so I knew I was going to see you, but I'm sorry  to get back to you.  That's okay.  And you're doing a...  All right, Jimmy.  Oh, yes, I'm dancing.  We should promote the...  Well, you're dancing where?  Hustle Club?  No, it's called Cafe Royale.  Oh, Cafe Royale.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  Jim.  Jimmy.  Come to Strip Club.  Needy.  Goodbye, Needy.  He got you so bad.  He has to turn around.  Why?  Why?  That what happens when you get gut?  You don't want to act like you got gut.  All right, Jimmy.  Have fun, Jimmy.  Anthony, Cafe Royale.  Oh, Cafe Royale.  That's where you're dancing along now.  It looks like an actual, like, little restaurant.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, we kind of know.  You know, we've been there.  Oh, yeah, Long Island, guys.  Well, I'm glad.  A lot of talent there, huh? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  If you ask Anthony Nicely, he might even show.  He might even show.  You never know.  Well, I'd love for you guys to show up and keep me company there.  I go.  Now through Saturday.  So, tonight and tomorrow at Cafe Royale in Long Island.  Yeah.  You know what?  It was actually fun last night.  It really was.  Yeah?  Although, you know, one of the managers said something rude to me there.  Because I do, you know, I do dances, but I don't, you know, I do like a table dance, but  I don't always do them.  I mean, sometimes I don't do them in cities.  So, he's like, do you do dances?  I'm like, no, no, not really.  I let the house girls do that.  You guys pay me a beer. 
[03:36:00]  I sell my stuff.  And that way the girls make money and they don't hate me then, you know?  Sure.  And he's like, really?  Because, you know, most of the girls do, you know.  You know, the guys think you guys are pretty much the biggest whores on earth.  So, I'm surprised you guys don't do the dances.  I'm like.  Jesus.  And he said it to me.  And this is a fat guy in a butt-tight, pin-tight, striped suit.  Don't say that.  Now they're going to, like, kill us.  Okay?  Now they're going to kill us.  Holy shit.  We love the club.  Now I'm going to have, like, two angry porn stars after me.  No, I really like the club. 
[03:36:30]  I just.  I like your logic on that.  You know, and I think that's because I don't think that the porn stars do the dances.  I mean, you're going to charge a lot more.  And then the regular girls, because they don't really like when you're there to begin with.  No, they just want to dance and make their money.  And they think that you're taking their money.  But at least, you know, when you don't do the dances, then the girls kind of work with you.  Because they don't feel like.  Why do they have to come here and take our money?  Our money.  Why do they do?  All right.  There was a Russian girl there.  Can we have more Russian strippers, for fuck's sake?  Jesus, enough already.  Yeah, really.  I want American girls taking their clothes off. 
[03:37:00]  I like American girls.  Yes.  You like American girls?  Yes.  Taking their clothes off.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  They're all from other lands now.  I like the chance that you might see someone, you know, from your neighborhood dancing around.  That's a good point.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  Do you have any new dance moves when you're featuring?  You want me to dance?  You want me to dance?  You know what?  I just do, like, a lot of splits and stuff.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  You don't like matches or anything? 
[03:37:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Can you slide up and down a pole and stuff like that?  Yeah, I can do, like...  No offense.  Oh, yeah.  She does it every night.  Yeah.  When you ain't sleeping, tired.  Oh, no, sometimes I have to wake him up by doing that, you know?  And they keep her laughing, because those people bounce nicely.  They just bounce when she laughs.  Oh, by the way, you guys have a really nice little intern here.  Sean.  Oh, yeah.  I told him to leave that girl, though, for good.  Did you guys hear about that girl?  Yeah, the Peace Corps girl. 
[03:38:00]  That she's on them all the time?  Yeah.  I don't like that.  She's going to be a victim of a fucking clitoral circumcision in Nairobi.  What does the Peace Corps do exactly?  They go to places that you never want to go and try to teach people things they should  have learned fucking ages ago.  Maybe I'll go join the Peace Corps.  Yeah?  It might be fun.  You could be a whole village with those girls.  Oh!  What?  What?  I don't know.  Maybe I'll do that.  I was thinking of joining the military at one point, but I don't know.  Yeah?  Well, when I was younger, I was like, if nothing works, you know, if I don't have any more 
[03:38:30]  career and I'm broke, I guess I'll join the military if nothing happens.  Yeah, you'd have been a hit there, I'll tell you that.  She's on the lecture circuit, too.  Oh, yes.  I'm doing a lecture with Corinne Stephens.  Also known as Superhead?  Yeah, she was that girl that, no, do you guys, no, she really is known as that.  Is that a brand new superhero we don't know about?  No, she was like the video vixen and all the rapper videos that wrote a book talking  about all those guys, and yes, we're going to do a, I just met her, but she was, you  know, when I came home, I was like, Mario, I just met her, she has all this wisdom, and 
[03:39:00]  he was so mad at me.  He's like, do not tell me that that girl has any wisdom.  Yeah, wow.  Superhead and wisdom, like an oxymoron.  She's so deep, I bet.  No, she's changed her life, and she's...  Yeah?  But what are you guys lecturing about?  She wrote a book called, Seduce the Man and Keep It, I think, and she just asked me if  I could help her at the lectures, like we're going to teach people sexual massages or something  that.  Oh, sensual massage. 
[03:39:30]  I'm not really good at massages, so she'll have to teach me, too.  Yeah, I just skipped that part.  Girls don't have to be, as long as they're touching, and then they just reach around  real quick.  You know who are good at massages?  I've got a magic button.  The fat girls are really good at massages.  Are they?  Yeah, they are.  Because they've got to try a little harder.  They really are, now they think about that.  You don't have to sit around fucking massaging a guy to maybe...  All right, well.  I think, you know, the strip club I was at last week, I remember it was in Yuma, and one  of the girls, he accidentally, because he gets my costume for me, and he brought some 
[03:40:00]  other girls' underwear back, and they were like...  Oh, shit.  Giant.  They were that...  Well, because they were on the stage, they were that big.  Like, the girls in Yuma were like...  Wow, giant.  Yeah.  Yeah, big, big...  She's making the giant piggy.  Yeah.  They were, though.  Remember, I held them up next to me.  Yeah.  At least 46s.  No.  At least...  They were bigger than Mario.  Like, they would have been big on Mario.  They were big.  That means Mario, yeah.  Are you dabbling in that, Mario?  No.  No, no, no.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, just try him on.  Mario goes, I'm good.  I'm all right.  What happens on Wendy? 
[03:40:30]  Hey, we like this Mario guy.  Me too.  You guys should, you know, maybe try to stick this one out.  I think we're going to.  You're going to have kids or anything?  I want to.  I'm not yet, though.  I mean, I actually asked Steve if I could babysit his son to practice, but he didn't seem eager.  But I want kids, like, in a couple of years, I think.  Like, when I'm, like, 32, 33, 34, maybe.  When you stop throwing up on planes?  Yes, exactly.  You know what?  Because you can't throw up and not mommy.  Drinking and throwing up on planes is fun. 
[03:41:00]  Believe me, it's a pisser.  And I love doing it.  That's why I just wouldn't have kids.  I'm too much of a, like, if I go, like, I kind of want to go to the Borgata.  I just want to fucking go to the Borgata.  Yeah.  If I go, like, I want to go to the Bahamas.  I just want to go.  I don't want to have to, now I see my brother and sister that have the kids, and they're  always like, I have to carry so much shit with them.  Yes, they do.  They do.  There's, like, a fucking kit that you've got to carry around with you all the time.  So it's just like, I can't be bothered with it.  I think people should wait until they're older for kids.  Did you forget that I'm having a kid any day now?  Oh, you are.  I'm sorry. 
[03:41:30]  I really appreciate that little speech.  But for me, that's just for me.  That's my personal opinion.  Now that we've got the party pooper out of the room, Jim Norton, you can really talk about  partying with Anthony, because Anthony enjoys it.  I do enjoy a good get-together at night and a good drink.  And you should come to the club tonight and drink.  I should.  Anthony, you know what you should do?  Yeah.  Down a few, yeah.  Compound tonight.  Oh, yeah?  He's got an amazing crib on Long Island.  Oh, really?  We'll do a little Cafe Royale.  A little nice place. 
[03:42:00]  After party.  After party.  I'll bring the girls from the club.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Well, let me text you my address and I'll get right on that.  Anthony, who's your best friend right now?  Pretty open here.  You guys should really do this.  Okay.  Because Anthony has a, he's got a movie theater.  You guys can watch.  Wow.  He's got a poker table.  Big bar downstairs.  Oh, karaoke.  I love karaoke.  The pool's open next week.  Oh, that's okay.  That's okay.  It's too cold.  No.  Mario, would you like to go to Anthony's this weekend?  He did?  Oh, for sure. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's coming for you.  He did, really?  Yeah.  I didn't bring a baby to you.  Can I go naked?  No, it doesn't matter if she's bringing another girl from the club.  I need some romance fucking pulls.  No, we don't do romance.  We're a union.  Ah, shit.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Then I need some fucking...  See, you can talk union stuff with Anthony.  I mean, this is perfect.  This will be fun, yes, because I don't know what to do out there.  You know, I didn't know it so far.  I would love the 40.  Yeah.  It's three out here, isn't it?  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  Not sure.  40.  Yeah, I was 28 back in the old days.  Tin Knocker crawled around fucking attics and shit like that. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, yeah, we crawl around attics, too.  It sucks.  I can't picture his job.  Like, sometimes he complains to me.  It's real work.  That's why.  It's like real work.  Yeah, he gets mad at me when I complain about my stuff.  He's like, you guys should dance around for a couple hours.  Yeah, you're naked for 12 minutes.  I sit here, yeah, right.  Shaking your tits, and I'm on my back, you know, wiring something.  Every day, it's like, you know, every day I come in here, I was like, I really worked,  so I know that this is just goofing around with friends and shit like that.  But there's nothing better than when a homeowner was like, oh, could you get the grill in 
[03:43:30]  the eave, like, really close, and you got the roofing nails hitting you in the head  and pulling your fucking hair out.  Yeah, with your headlight on.  You're trying to get a fucking, like, a little fucking saw to cut the square out, and you're  just banging the nails that are coming through the roof.  Pain in the fucking ass.  That's real work.  That man really works.  See, but you're a skinny guy.  Imagine me, you know, trying to get in there.  Yeah, and it's like a hundred.  Oh, yeah, it's tough.  And people decided they wanted air conditioning put in in August.  So you're in the attic when it's, like, 150 degrees. 
[03:44:00]  It sucked.  Now I feel bad.  And then I have to go home and have sex.  What the fuck?  Yeah, see?  At least you got, you know.  All right.  That must take a day really long.  Yeah.  It's like, jeez, I could go home and have sex.  Well, because I don't wake up usually until, like, he has lunch break at 11.45, and that's  when I usually wake up.  Oh, that's good.  So I wake up when he comes home.  That doesn't piss him off as he's doing.  He gets really mad at me.  And then I go home for lunch.  He goes, where's my coffee?  No, I don't do that.  Fire.  I'm not that bad.  He gets really mad when I sleep in late.  He's, like, really mean to me about it. 
[03:44:30]  Wake up!  All right.  Let's get this set up, though.  Anthony.  Okay.  Anthony's birthday is Monday, I guess?  Yeah, that'd be great.  Because, um, no, no, it's, uh, we're having the party, um, uh, Sunday.  You're having a party at my house on Sunday.  Yeah, and that'd be great.  All the strippers could come over to my house with Mom and Sal and my aunts and uncle.  Oh, would they love that?  Your uncles won't love that?  My uncles would.  You don't think Sal would love that?  I don't think the aunts would like it.  Sal would love that.  Sal would love it.  I want to do a motorboat.  I want to give the girls a motorboat. 
[03:45:00]  Would you allow Sal to have a motorboat?  It's Anthony's stepfather for many, many years.  You're going to be like, instead of bringing a clown to your birthday party, I'll be like,  the motorboat is.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'll just stand there and everyone can line up.  Marino, would you mind that?  If he's old, I'm okay.  It's Sal.  He's been an aunt's dad, you know, father of the year for a real long time.  Oh, I definitely would do that for him.  Why don't you guys set up the little after-show party tonight or tomorrow?  After-show party.  You know what?  I'll come down.  I'll go down there.  Yes, come.  Yes, I need some fun.  And then, uh, have a few beverages and, uh, we'll see what transpires. 
[03:45:30]  We got Jackie the joke man.  We got her.  We got a lot of stuff to do on, uh, Long Island.  A lot going on.  All right, Mary, we're going to wrap up.  So it's Cafe Royale tonight or tomorrow.  Oh, yeah, I need to have my new website.  It is Friday.  Yeah, it's called, uh...  Club Mary Carey.  Club Mary Carey.  I'm trying to get back my marycarey.com.  So now it's clubmarycarey.com.  That's not where it's, though.  But it's my favorite.  I've had a lot of websites over the years, but I stopped doing my old website when I was  on Celebrity Rehab, so I'd not done a site since August of 2007. 
[03:46:00]  And now I have a new site with new stuff.  Is it all porn, or are you doing other stuff on there?  No, it's just, yeah, it's just pictures of me.  Okay.  But, like, yeah, a lot of solo girl stuff, but...  What else was I going to ask you?  Oh, uh, Twitter.  Oh, yes, twitter.com backslash realmarycarey.  Real Mary Carey.  Yeah.  And I'm sure you tweet some nice photos, right?  I do.  Oh, I do tweet a lot of photos, and...  Well, I need to find you guys, though, so you guys are each separate.  I was looking up Obi and Andrew at the show.  Yeah, yeah, we just, you know why?  Because we do the show together.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  So we figure separate Twitters are kind of, you know, our own thing.  We like being individuals.  Yeah, you do?  Who would have thought?  Everyone thinks we're twins or something.  It's annoying at times.  Where's Obi?  We like to show our individual.  Oh, my God.  They must ask you that everywhere.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everywhere.  It's like, where's Obi?  I go, where's Anthony?  Yeah, he's back at the house.  He slept in late.  How about...  I gave him a kiss goodbye, and we...  How about you just enjoy Obi?  Because I'm here right now.  Hey, yeah.  They never...  They never enjoy the guy...  How about you just enjoy...  Yeah, who's here?  They never enjoy the guy that they're talking to.  They always want the other guy. 
[03:47:00]  Looking over your shoulder.  Right.  There's the other guy.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm Opie Radio on Twitter.  That's Anthony Kumi on C-U-M-I-A.  But we'll write it down for you.  Yay!  I'm going to write you guys on Twitter all the time now.  I'm just going to pop on you, and then I'll follow you.  Then you write me something, yeah.  And I sign Mario up on Twitter.  He's real Mario Monji.  Real Mario Monji.  I just was excited to be real, Mary Karen.  Yeah.  Makes it easier.  That's nice.  It's fun.  He doesn't like Twitter much, so...  I think, uh...  Anything else?  I was going to tweet, yeah.  I put in a fucking, you know, 220 box today. 
[03:47:30]  Pull some wire.  Yeah, pull some wire.  Pull some wire.  Notched some shit that the stupid carpenters put in.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, fuck, please.  Dumb carpenters.  You're supposed to leave a hole in the floor there, dummy.  You guys got to get together this.  Always.  Yes, we should.  I want the stories, you know?  I want the stories.  Exactly.  Always.  All right.  We should, uh...  Get the saws on.  I don't care.  I'm notching something major.  It's not your belly, either.  Fuck them. 
[03:48:00]  Mary Carrie, always a pleasure.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  Good friend of the show.  I loved it.  Has done some great radio for us over the years.  Yes, nothing...  Cafe Royale tonight or tomorrow.  Although, you know the other time was really funny.  It was the time I was really, like, in Vegas, and I think I was, like, really high  when I smoked weed.  I showed up with you guys.  That was my voice.  All right.  We were doing the, uh...  My voice was gone.  I found...  CES?  Yes, yes.  CES, probably, yeah.  I couldn't talk, and I...  Ah, we got through it.  Oh, no.  It was funny.  Yeah.  But, yay.  Yay.  Yay.  I found it.  That was...  I had a copy of it, and I found it.  We had, like, a car... 
[03:48:30]  A long car road trip.  And I'm like, oh, this is Opie and Anthony from 2005, and I guess I broke it or something  because it wasn't playing in my car.  I played it for lots of people, but...  All right.  We'll get another copy of that for you.  Thank you.  Let's get out of here.  All right.  Bye, everybody.  After our weekends.  Everybody, thank you for tuning in.  Peace, homies.  To our show.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
