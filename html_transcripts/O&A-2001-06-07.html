<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's first live broadcast from WYSP in Philadelphia opened with chaotic banter and highly offensive language.  Two WYSP "ambassadors" presented gifts. The hosts, displaying Opie's limited basketball knowledge, discussed Allen Iverson's recent game.  Immediately, the show was flooded with overwhelmingly negative listener feedback, criticizing the lack of music and the hosts' juvenile humor, often using homophobic and other offensive language themselves.  The hosts, comparing this reaction to their New York debut, predicted a listener "purge" and celebrated their new contract by calling their seemingly intoxicated program director, Tim Sabian, who would repeatedly call throughout the broadcast expressing increasing distress at the negative listener response and sheer volume of angry calls.

A significant portion of the show involved listener calls, ranging from furious rejection to tentative acceptance. A call from a regular New York listener offered encouragement to the Philadelphia audience.  Melissa, a WYSP employee, was jokingly accused of an affair with their boss.  Recurring show characters, such as "Gay Marco" (who recounted graphic sexual exploits on Disney rides and an unsuccessful attempt to win NSYNC tickets via fellatio), and "Old Dirty," were featured.  The show included segments like "Guess What's In My Pants," featuring a caller describing her pubic hair texture, and repeated prank calls involving the phrase "Butt Plug."  Comedian Jim Norton joined in studio, offering support alongside Joey Paisano, a restaurant owner.  The hosts also engaged in racially and ethnically insensitive remarks.  They discussed the MOVE bombing and Philadelphia's reputation for violence and corruption.

Scheduled guests included Stephen Lynch, who performed songs, and WWF wrestler Steve Richards, whose appearance devolved into insults and a discussion of a past altercation where he choked Opie. Brother Joe also performed songs, including one about the Bush daughters and another about Schindler's List.  A prank call segment, "Hi, Mom, I'm in porn," was also featured.  The show incorporated musical segments, including a Seinfeld parody and a song called "Gerbil," alongside a recurring bit detailing a previous incident involving a 75-year-old stripper, Sandy Kane, a listener, and Preparation H.  A contest was announced, offering Arrowsmith tickets to anyone who could maintain an erection in the presence of "the retarded Laverne and Shirley," two abrasive female fans who appeared in studio, along with further highly offensive and vulgar banter involving frequent use of derogatory terms for people with disabilities, insults about physical appearance, and sexually explicit comments, escalating into a chaotic exchange of insults and personal attacks between the hosts, "Laverne and Shirley," and callers. The broadcast concluded with more listener reactions, further commentary on "Laverne and Shirley," promotional material for sponsors, and a comedic song from their archives.  Numerous commercials, including one for Bud Light and Diamond Vision, aired throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. Anthony, all owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  I'm a neighbor!  I'm a neighbor!  I'm a neighbor!  I'm a neighbor!  I'm a neighbor!  What the fuck was that? 
[00:00:30]  Let's go in for the sound.  Let's go in for the sound.  Let's go in for the sound.  Let's go in for the sound.  Let's go in for the sound.  I'll beat up a check for you.  What?  Eh, eh.  Oh, eh, eh.  You're not gonna do it!  You're not gonna do it!  You're not gonna do it!  Okay, watch this.  Little baby!  Get out of here!  What?  Little baby!  Stupid friggin' twat! 
[00:01:00]  Turn off.  Let me just show you how serious I am.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  Welcome.  Howdy, maggot!  You son of a bitch!  I don't know why I just did it right.  What the hell?  What a way to start.  Hey!  Getting the word twat.  Yeah, that's great.  On twice already, Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  Well, this is the Oakland Anthony Show.  Hi!  For those of you in New York, nothing new.  But, hope your first day in the Philly.  Yeah, I hear we have a few listeners today checking us out in Philadelphia.  Yeah!  Welcome to the family.  I must say, Allen Iverson had a great game last night.  You're starting the ass-kissing right away.  No, what?  I'm wearing the Allen Iverson jersey.  I see.  I wear it every week.  Yeah.  Why would today be any different? 
[00:02:00]  You do not.  Don't ass-kiss.  Come on.  There's pictures up on WNAW.com.  Yeah.  Of us wearing our normal wear.  I got the Allen Iverson Fixers jersey on.  And you got the Phillies t-shirt on.  The only one that was left.  Two lovely ladies from YSP came up and brought us a bunch of stuff.  Right.  A bunch of, like, touristy stuff.  Look, I'm drinking coffee out of my Philadelphia City Skyline mug. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I got the little Liberty Bell on my desk now.  Yeah.  All the touristy stuff.  Yeah, well, hey.  Hello, Philly.  Those girls from YSP are outside the studio right now.  Yeah.  Ambassadors.  Hey, ladies.  At the fine folks at WYSP are wondering, we have kidnapped the lovely ladies.  Yeah.  They're like, man, we're going to be in trouble if we don't get back there immediately.  So what's the word on the street?  Everybody's so excited.  We're all psyched. 
[00:03:00]  Really?  Yes.  Nice.  Good.  Are you guys very exciting for us, too?  Welcome to Philly.  You're supposed to get back to Philly now, or?  Well, we've called our boss and told her we didn't want to come back yet.  That's good.  We've got a Jaeger machine in the office.  Yeah, we saw that.  You like that?  Yeah, we're going to go in there later.  I think one of them is Philly.  Do you have one of those in Philadelphia?  I doubt it.  No.  Yeah, our office is equipped with, it's like a bar.  Did you see it?  Yes, we did.  We saw the refrigerator that said beer on it.  Yeah, we have two fridges.  One says beer, and one says food, and the food fridge is full of beer, too. 
[00:03:30]  So feel free to grab one or a shot out of the Jaeger machine.  Thank you.  Because at this radio station, we just kind of hang out and drink.  Nothing ever really gets done.  No, no, you're not learning anything here on this show.  Believe me.  Good.  Thanks for bringing all that stuff up.  You're welcome.  The Philly cheesesteaks, Anthony.  Making us feel welcome.  I haven't had one of those since I was a little boy growing up in Philly.  You didn't grow up.  Don't.  Don't.  Full. 
[00:04:00]  Come on.  What?  Everyone knows I was born and raised in Philly.  From Long Island.  Shut up.  I'm not even going to try to fake it.  Because then you have people that call up and ask you where you lived and where you  went to school, and you just go, bye.  I feel like an idiot.  No, I got the map in front of me.  I can wing it.  I'm going, I'm being honest.  I know nothing of the sports teams, the city, nothing.  But I'm willing to learn.  You don't know anything about the Sixers?  No.  I'm not, and this is nothing new. 
[00:04:30]  You know, I'm not a big fan of basketball.  I know it's huge in Philly right now.  This is no.  I hear the Sixers, what, they're doing well?  Oh.  This is no kiss-ass.  They looked great last night, and I am rooting for the Sixers in the series.  No, I don't.  Iverson came alive in overtime.  He did, did he?  Oh, my God, did he?  I don't know.  Pulled it out.  How many points did Allen Iverson score last night?  If you had a guess.  Going to teach everyone right off the bat in Philadelphia who the sports fan and the 
[00:05:00]  basketball fan is and who.  No, don't look in the Philadelphia paper.  Oh, 48 points.  Oh.  All right.  How many did he have?  I can read.  How many points at halftime?  At halftime?  24?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you want from me?  I don't know anything about basketball in general.  The answer, 30.  30.  Yes.  All right.  So how do we do this?  We've never, like, you know, done a show for another city. 
[00:05:30]  No.  I think we just, we're kind of in a dilemma because we have a huge New York audience.  And if we spend time, you know, just talking to Philly, they're going to get pissed.  Yeah.  But if Philadelphia doesn't feel like they're involved with what we're doing and up to  speed, they're going to get mad.  Yeah.  It's like cheating on your bitches, you know?  You've got to watch what you do.  You can't let one on to the other one.  You've got to kind of ease into it.  I think we could all coexist is what I'm thinking.  Wow.  I have a feeling like the New York listeners could kind of tell the Philadelphia listeners 
[00:06:00]  what to expect from the O&A show.  Oh, what they're going to get?  Yeah.  You're going to leave that up to the listeners?  Yeah.  We have faith in them, right?  Great.  We've been with the New York audience for over three years now.  Yeah.  I think they could handle it.  They're feeling the pressure.  So you want them to kind of break in the Philly audience?  Sure.  Why not?  To what we're all about.  It's a good start, right?  And then we'll do the regular things we do on our radio program and hopefully people will  dig it.  Yeah, because I've got to get more educated on Philly, Opie. 
[00:06:30]  Do you?  I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to Philadelphia.  I know all the basic history that they teach in school.  That's about it.  Maybe our listeners can chime in.  We should get the program director of WYSP on the line, too, to see if he's still running  around crapping himself, going crazy.  Yeah, I guess he's really happy today.  Yeah, he was getting drunk the other night when he found out we were coming to the station.  Yeah, we gave him a phone call and said, Tim, we're ready. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And what did he say?  He just crapped himself?  Yeah, he crapped himself and he's going out to get a drink.  No, he said he was going out to get S-faced.  Yeah.  And that's when we thought, you know what?  We're going to get along just fine.  Yeah.  With the fine folks at WYSP.  Come into the office.  We'll fire up the Jager.  You want to go to the phones, Anthony, and see where this goes?  Yeah, let's see how this works.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we got the phone number for the New York audience.  You guys know what that is.  It's 212-757-1027.  For everyone else, it's 1-877-692-1027. 
[00:07:30]  We make things nice and easy here.  Right.  Why couldn't we have a nice 1-800 number?  I don't know.  I think they're working on that.  Instead, it's 877-692-1027.  Okay?  Let's go to Pluto.  Pluto, what's going on?  Hey, hey, guys.  Where's my music?  I can't hear anything.  Who's there talking?  Yeah.  What's all this nonsense?  You know what?  I know you're from New York, you bastard.  You're not fooling anyone.  We're going to tell Philly to close their doors and pull their pants down, 
[00:08:00]  because that's what your show is all about.  All right, Pluto.  Thanks.  Good luck.  Thank you.  Yeah, we're kind of used to this, too.  When we first came to NEW, it was a music station.  YSP was playing music in the afternoon.  Until yesterday.  So we're used to the whole shut up and play the music.  It happened when we came here.  And then slowly, like a virus, we creep into the system.  And you get used to it.  I know right now it's not what you're used to.  But you've got to give it a little time.  It takes time.  I think they will.  I think so. 
[00:08:30]  I'm kind of distracted, because look what's behind you.  All the empty bottles of champagne from yesterday's show.  From yesterday.  Yeah, we're not against drinking on this show.  We've done it occasionally.  Yesterday was a big day.  Yesterday we were celebrating because we just signed a new contract.  Yeah.  Hence being live in Philadelphia today.  Yeah.  And we went through nine bottles of champagne.  Yeah.  While we're trying to do our radio show.  So it's a little rough.  We'll try not to drink the excess.  Right. 
[00:09:00]  Tim.  You.  Hey.  Tim Sabian, the PD of WYSP.  Tim.  What's happening?  How's it working?  Are we number one yet?  That's all he cares about.  I saw all your quotes in the Philadelphia papers today, you bastard.  The self-centered, selfish person that I am?  Right.  Yeah.  Are we number one yet?  Not yet.  Okay.  Give us until next Thursday.  See, he doesn't care.  It's just product B or product C or whatever the hell is in this time slot.  That's all he cares about.  That's right.  Tim, what's the vibe down there? 
[00:09:30]  It's big.  It's big.  It's big?  It's big.  We have a lot of people listening today?  Everybody's in the hall, up and down.  It's just a buzz.  It's buzzing.  Great.  And they're saying be funny.  Have they come into your office yet and said, well, they're really not doing anything yet?  It's been nine minutes.  Right.  Yeah.  Where's the funny stuff?  It's on the way.  But, yeah, everyone's psyched down there?  It is great.  It is welcome to Philadelphia.  This is a historic day at WYST once again. 
[00:10:00]  And we're looking forward to doing whatever it takes.  And we will be big in afternoons.  This is huge.  Huge.  We don't know if it's history like...  It's huge.  History like inventing a serum for a disease or history like a building collapse.  But it's going to be history one way or another.  It's about the audience.  It's about building an audience and just taking care of business here.  And are we number one yet?  Not yet.  But, oh, my God, this guy's just going to be on our ass the whole time, Opie.  It's going to be on our ass the whole time. 
[00:10:30]  Well, we know what's a phone call we're not going to take too often.  Not with your help, Tim.  Yeah, Tim.  Well, the ONA virus has spread to Philadelphia.  What can I tell you?  It's intense.  It's intense.  Thank you, Tim.  All right, Tim.  Great statement.  Welcome.  Great quotes.  Anything you guys need?  No.  We've got two lovely ladies from Philadelphia.  We've got the care package, and we're pretty psyched.  All right.  Hey, what song we're supposed to be playing right now today?  Right now?  Aerosmith.  Oops. 
[00:11:00]  Sorry.  Sorry, Aerosmith.  All right.  Thanks, Tim.  We've got to do a show, okay?  All right.  Congratulations.  I want to talk to Melissa.  Yeah, we know Melissa.  We share Melissa with Philadelphia.  Melissa.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Oh, you hot bitch.  Hey, you were in a car wreck or something?  Yeah.  What happened?  I miss you guys.  I wanted to be there so bad to bring up all that stuff from Karen and Tim and Neil and  everybody, but I, uh...  Those luscious breasts, you've got to get tied up on your arms when you're trying to make  a leg?  I'm talking off.  What happened?  Yeah, I got a little banged up. 
[00:11:30]  I was coming home from an appearance.  Banged up.  I got into a little minor four-car accident.  Are you okay?  Yeah, I'll be back up in a few days.  You ever see guys driving around her when they try to drive?  That's probably what happened.  Yeah, they try to run me off the road, and it finally happened.  They look at her.  They're looking down her shirt.  You know, I think this would be a good time to tell Philadelphia that Melissa is having  an affair with our boss, Ken Stevens.  Oh, God, guys.  We were the first ones to break that.  You already ruined me in New York.  You're going to do it to my fans in Philadelphia?  They know me.  Don't forget.  Well, they should know that we think you're having an affair with our boss, Ken Stevens. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, God.  Ken brought Melissa, who's very familiar to the people that listen to YSP, brought her  here to try to inject some sexuality into this station.  Lord knows we needed it.  Yeah.  So he brings her up, and we're like, wow, who's this?  Oh, it's Melissa.  And then all of a sudden, they're gone for these two-hour-long lunches, and then we can't  get a hold of her.  We can't get him.  But even better than that, Melissa was around here for, what, guys, two or three weeks? 
[00:12:30]  And we never saw her do anything.  She was like the new hire here in New York.  And I finally go to Ann.  I go, Ann, this hot broad, she's not doing anything.  Nothing.  What did she do?  She was hired.  She walks around being hot.  Yeah, we figured out her job was to just be hot.  Yeah.  And then we kind of dug deeper, and we found out that she may be having an affair with  Ken Stevens.  She was missing when Ken was missing.  And then when he came home with body glitter in his beard, we just knew it. 
[00:13:00]  We knew it.  Body glitter is a tag.  He said that.  It's a tag that women use now.  You can't come home with body glitter on your beard or on your hands and explain it  away.  This is so not true, guys.  Come on.  Good, good.  You know I'm out working.  I'm out with the people.  I'm out with the fans.  We never know what she does, though.  I actually called in to tell you that I am the one that's always out with the fans and  out with the people.  I've told a lot of people about you.  They're really psyched. 
[00:13:30]  And, you know, we're all excited about this silly thing.  Yes, and Ken's very excited.  Melissa, thank you.  All right, guys.  I sent you a little something, so when it comes there, don't be too surprised.  Okay, we won't.  A little something.  A big something.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Melissa.  All right.  I'm going to come up and see you soon, okay?  All right.  All right.  Take care.  Okay.  Bye.  Do you want to go to Tom, who's calling from Philadelphia?  Tom, our first call from Philadelphia. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, your first call from Philadelphia?  The first call from Philadelphia is telling you we don't want you guys here.  I love it.  I can already tell you the trash.  There we go.  How can you tell after 15 minutes?  Because you guys aren't funny at all.  Well, give it some time.  Give it some time.  I want to listen to rock and roll.  I don't want to listen to more people talking.  There's a million talk stations in Philadelphia.  And there's a million radio stations playing music, right, Tom?  Well, we want music.  We don't want to listen to white trash people from New York. 
[00:14:30]  You stay in New York.  You should have stayed in New York.  Don't try coming around here.  Oh, no.  Hey, Tom.  What?  What song are you missing right now?  Aerosmith, like Tim just said.  I think they would have been into the next song by now.  Well, they would have been playing Led Zeppelin then.  All right.  You guys are white trash.  Just order us to it.  What Led Zeppelin song?  Let me see.  Dire Mayer or some stuff.  Haven't you heard that enough, Tom?  No, I don't want to.  No one in Philly wants to listen to you guys.  Yeah.  You just wait and see, all right, Tom? 
[00:15:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not going to wait.  We'll obviously be talking to him as the weeks go on.  I think he'll call back.  I got to tell everyone, man.  We've been through this before.  It's okay.  This happened when we first came here to New York.  It was just a mess.  The station was playing music.  We come on.  It's like, shut up and play the music.  Right.  So we're fully prepared to hear that.  To take on all the negative phone calls.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, we should get someone from New York to explain this to the fine folks. 
[00:15:30]  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, it's been Anthony.  Congratulations.  Syndication.  Hey, thanks, man.  I just want to leave a personal message to Tom.  Yeah.  He's a tool.  That's the last thing.  I want to say, I love the show.  I've been listening for two years.  The medication isn't working.  Nothing works around there.  Thank you, Frank.  No problem.  All right.  Let's go to Pete.  Hey, Pete, you're next on the O&A show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  You know, you have to listen to these guys the same way I felt when you came on the air  in New York.  And I got over it.  A round of What's in Her Pants works real well.  And I think you should ask this lovely lady from Philly to help join me with that. 
[00:16:00]  You know, before the end of the show today, yes, we will have a lady from Philadelphia  playing What's in My Pants.  Right.  Nothing like What's in My Pants to build camaraderie between cities.  I think you're right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  That will be the instant feedback that we have on the computer here.  You can comment on the show as it happens from the YSP listeners.  A little brutal right now.  Okay.  What are they saying?  Stay in New York, you stupid mother effers. 
[00:16:30]  I want to hear rock.  That's why I listen to the station.  Go home, a-holes.  Goodbye.  We don't want to hear your inane dribble in the afternoon.  Bring back the music.  You suck.  Cousin Ed would eff you up.  Cousin Ed is still on YSP.  Yeah.  He's on before us now, right?  Anthony, this is what's called the purge.  Yeah.  We call it the purge.  The purge.  There are certain people that just will not listen to this show. 
[00:17:00]  They want their music and won't listen.  This is known as phase one.  Phase one is the purge.  They go away.  Yeah.  They have no desire to deal with us.  They want their music they've heard a million times.  Right.  And they'll go find another station.  And then the other people will come in and everyone will be happy.  And we'll be throwing some fine parties.  Right.  Clarence, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Oh.  Oh and A.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yo, you broke the curse.  Huh?  This is wine.  Oh, I know.  Oh, he's wine.  Come on, man.  Hey, you're the reason. 
[00:17:30]  I love the Sixers.  Hey, yo.  I'll hand about Moses Malone, all right?  All right.  Thanks, Clarence.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Carmine.  Carmine, what's up?  Oh and A.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  That's all I got to say.  Listen, I got advice for the listeners of Philly, especially Tom.  Okay.  It's like listening to you guys, it's like if you're going to go in a pool and you keep, you  know, putting your big toe in the water and you're like, ooh, that's cold, you back  away.  With this show, you've got to jump in head first.  And you're swimming around and you're like, you know what?  This is not so bad.  The only thing you've got to worry about is if you're listening to Philly, you know when 
[00:18:00]  you hit the bottom and it hurts?  That's like, that's going to be dice.  It goes away after a while.  Take care, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  That's a good way to look at it.  You'll get used to the temperature of the pool very soon.  Yeah, we're used to this.  If you're brave enough to jump in, things will be just fine.  It's a getting to know you phase right now.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, this is a Bax, man.  I'm from Philly.  This is great. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, you like it.  Tom, I have a feeling you've heard us before.  Well, I've been listening to you guys for about over a year.  Okay, that's why.  Yeah, the guys are great.  You know what?  I'm at home.  I can't wait because at least when I'm driving down 95 and I'm almost home, I can put on 94  and listen to the rest of the show because it always gets really good when I'm halfway  home and I'm like, I can't hear it.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  See, Sam from Philly checking in saying, who the hell are you?  Yeah, you don't know us.  You can't just dive in like we're pals yet. 
[00:19:00]  But believe me, you'll be our pal.  You want to be my pal, Danny?  Like you're not, you'll be our pal.  Right.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, I hope what's happening, man.  Now, you know, here's a guy that could talk to Philadelphia because Paul, I remember Paul.  Paul is a regular listener of our show.  He absolutely hated us when we first got to New York.  Right, Paul?  Yeah.  So, Philly, let me tell you something.  Nobody in the world hated these two douche nozzles more than I did. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Okay?  I mean, I think Opie has a tape somewhere of how much I hated them.  I mean, I was calling them every day, abusing them.  I wanted my music.  I didn't care what these guys said.  Nothing.  Give them time.  You'll love them.  But like I said, a lot of people are going to call up hating them.  And no matter how pissed off you people and silly are these guys, it doesn't compare with  the humiliation I drove them to over like a year period.  This guy was the biggest prick.  Yeah, and now we hang out and drink and stuff, right, Paul?  Right.  And then one day they decided to get me back. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, hey, Paul.  So for all you people that think that, uh...  Hey, Paul, what hooked you on the show?  There had to be like something that made you go, okay, all right, I can deal with this.  Well, when I heard Anthony, like I didn't know who was who back at that time, but his  impression of Don Imus was better than Don Imus himself.  And that's what hooked me up.  Because I'm a Billy West fan from the old school.  Right.  I was trained under Billy West.  I used to do voices as well.  Right.  But when I heard Anthony doing it, I quit doing my voices because he's amazing. 
[00:20:30]  For those of you in Philly that don't know, Anthony does a lot of good voices.  And I hope he does a lot of pumpkin picking, but you guys won't know about that until later  on in life.  All right, Paul, thank you.  So, Philly, keep listening, man.  Give him a shot, really.  Like I said, nobody hated these two Twinkies more than I did.  Tweedle-dum-a, Tweedle-dum-a, but we love you.  You are the age-vite.  All right, Paul, thank you.  Okay.  Anthony, we've got another call coming in from Philadelphia.  Yeah?  Yes, Philly.  Be more funny!  We're trying.  All right, we're just getting warmed up back then. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, it's getting acclimated to the whole thing.  We do have a lot of things to do today, and we've got to get out of here on time because  we have a Penthouse Pet of the Year party to get to.  Oh, and we have no clue what we're going to do there.  No.  They came in yesterday.  It's like a Penthouse Pet of the Year and a couple of the things, and they're just, it's  much better to have regular girls up here because the Penthouse girls, they never want  to do anything.  They're in magazines.  They're showing, you know, look like a cute hubba-bubba in the magazines, and they come 
[00:21:30]  in here, they don't want to show anything.  So we like the regular girls.  And we have some coming by today.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, are they regular.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the retarded Laverne and Shirley?  Yeah, we're going to have the retarded Laverne and Shirley on for everyone today.  Oh, I'm sure that'll just grab Philly by the balls.  Those two.  Jesus Christ.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, Tom.  Hey.  You guys always sound like Stone with, uh...  Hmm?  Yeah.  Tom?  With what? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, he couldn't even finish his, uh...  He couldn't even finish his thought.  He couldn't finish his bash.  Okay.  Dave, what's going down?  Hey, fellas, what's going on?  Hey.  I'm calling you out of Leventown, Pennsylvania.  Oh, cool.  I've been listening almost three years.  You guys kick ass.  I just want to tell everybody in Philly...  All right, we can't do that.  ...you guys are where it's at, man.  All right, thank you.  And to all the ladies out there, wow is good.  Yeah, we'll get to the wow thing next week.  All right, syndication when you guys do the daisy chain.  All right, thank you, Dave.  Be good.  All right, we can't take calls from people saying,  you know, you guys are really good, you guys suck. 
[00:22:30]  Nothing's getting done.  We need the New York callers to explain to Philly  what this show's all about.  A little bit about this show.  Maybe explain some of the characters that they'll hear.  Yeah.  You know, just walk them through it, okay?  And, um, I think we ought to play a little game  of what's in my pants to make us feel a little better.  Yeah, we'll do that in a little while.  We'll get a girl on the phone.  All right, and why don't we take our first break?  Well, we're going to do a little something  from the ONA archives, and we'll be back, okay?  Stay there.  I did, like, a whole cast of Seinfeld 
[00:23:00]  in, like, an anti-drug episode.  If they never did stuff like that,  that would have been funnier, like,  tonight on a very special Seinfeld,  Jerry's been doing drugs.  Why do my fingers look like little people?  Who are these people?  What are they doing to talk to each other?  They're talking about me.  What are they saying?  George, help me, George.  I have no idea, Jerry.  No idea.  Somebody help me.  Hey, Jerry, you look like you've been seeing  little people on your fingers.  All this comedy all these years,  we thought you were making this stuff up.  Well, I guess you just let the cap... 
[00:23:30]  You're right out of the back!  You can't tell!  Oh, I can tell.  It's written all over your face.  There's a woman on my face!  Well, maybe that was the little people  on your fingers.  Who's going to tell this to me?  Newman.  Hello, Jerry.  Hello, Newman.  I think we're also selling  Jerry Garcia at Breakthrough Dead  came up with his stabs.  You've seen them.  Have you seen them?  I licked them!  Now I'm seeing little people  on my fingers!  You're in my life!  You're in everybody's life!  In fact, you're the guy  who dropped that thing  and ruined Jurassic Park!  And you guys got it! 
[00:24:00]  The first radio station  ever to get my bitch!  Come on!  That's great!  That was Newman!  Bravo, man!  Newman screwed the whole damn thing up!  You're in back again!  You driving that Jeep in the mine?  Yeah!  There's nothing better  than a good Newman.  I love it!  Opie Anthony!  Opie Anthony!  Opie Anthony!  1027 WNEW!  Anthony, BMW Films!  Yeah, BMW Films

[00:25:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  I told you it's going to get.  It's our first day  live in Philadelphia,  Anthony,  on WYSB.  I'm feeling the love, O.P.  Yeah, we've been on the radio  about a half hour.  Yeah.  We got a lot of great  instant feedback coming in.  The purge has begun.  Do you want me to read  some of this?  Sure.  All right.  Raymond from Clifton Heights.  Your new syndication sucks.  Where is the music, man?  Enough tall crap  on during the day.  Get rid of it now.  All right. 
[00:26:00]  That's had some promise.  Sure.  A little promise.  He wasn't that angry.  Philly Joe.  What the F?  You guys suck.  Holy S.  Are you a comedy show  or something?  Just play some effing tunes  and shut the F up,  you New York pieces of F.  You just told me  they're a half hour.  What's that?  A little anger there.  A little anger.  Yeah.  Well, people enjoy  their musical.  Scott,  get the hell off  and play some Kiss.  Come on. 
[00:26:30]  How much Kiss  can you listen to?  I'm insulted by that one.  How are you  in Philadelphia?  Are you ready  to rock?  Rhonda.  Who are you  and where is John  and Cousin Ed?  Rob.  Howard Stern  in the morning.  He's funny.  Opie and Anthony,  not funny.  Isn't that the promo  they're running?  Right.  Looks like it's MMR  in the afternoons  for me. 
[00:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  Go there.  We don't care.  Philly fan.  Play some rock,  you effing suck.  I want rock.  I'm now changing  my station.  Oh.  T-Bone from Philly.  You're not done yet?  No.  Oh, no.  There's got to be  a thousand of these.  In my building,  I get two radio stations,  Jazz 106.1  and 94.1 WYSG.  Oh, can I guess?  He's going to listen to Jazz.  I think I need to start  listening to Jazz  because you guys suck.  Where's the Bella?  What the hell is this? 
[00:27:30]  Shut up and play the music.  Oh, it's shut up  and play the music  all over again.  Mike from Philly.  Rock and roll will destroy  you talk radio faggot.  Deja vu.  Oh, yeah.  Zach, I'm over here now.  You ruined WYSP.  Gack, gack, gack.  In the studio,  Cowbell Bill,  one of our friends.  Yeah.  Hello, Philly.  What's up, Bill?  I eat your cream cheese  every morning.  Feel the love. 
[00:28:00]  You're brave enough  to come in today, huh?  Absolutely.  Why not?  You see us wearing our  Sixers jersey.  I took mine off  until I started  feeling some love.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I still feel the love.  I'm waiting  until I feel  a little bit of love.  All right,  let's go back to the phones.  Jay, what's going on?  What's up?  O&A.  Hey, man.  Bill.  Hey.  I just want to educate  the Philadelphia crowd  about a little something  we have on the show  called the Curse of the Oap.  What?  My sports curse?  He supports a team. 
[00:28:30]  They lose.  They lose, yeah.  They lose,  but something happened.  They didn't lose last night.  No, I was rooting  for the Sixers yesterday  on this radio show  and look what happened.  It just shows you  that he wasn't really  rooting for them.  Maybe we're in the  beginning of a new era.  I think you're lying.  And the Phillies won as well.  So maybe the sports curse  is finally over, Jay.  Perhaps.  All right, thank you.  You guys rule  and Philadelphia,  just give them a chance.  They kick ass.  All right.  See, we're going back  to our security blanket.  See, look at this.  See, we come out 
[00:29:00]  a half hour into it  and we're like,  please, kiss us, please.  We act like we're brave  and we can handle  the abuse  that Philly's going  to give us today.  And then we took it  as much as we can  and now we're going  back to our little blankie.  It's like a prison rape.  You know,  you can never really  be prepared  for how awful  it's going to be.  I mean,  you just want a kiss.  It's bleeding  from the rear  and I need a kiss.  Fat Rob,  what's up?  What's up,  Bonet?  So,  you guys got to learn 
[00:29:30]  you're going to be  thankful that they're here  when you're seeing  boobs on the highway.  And to catch up,  you better tune in  to foundrymusic.com.  Yeah,  that's F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  music.com.  There's a lot of stuff  from our radio  past on there.  Yeah,  you could get caught up.  There's a lot of sound clips.  All right,  thank you.  Pictures,  video clips,  all kinds of stuff  that we've been doing  here for the past  three years.  I just hope people  aren't so close-minded  where they gave us  a half hour  and said,  you know what,  no,  there's nothing going on.  Three years of being  on the air here  and in a half hour  you can pretty much 
[00:30:00]  sum up what it's  going to be all about.  Especially if you like,  just like the music.  All right,  let's go to Matt.  Matt,  what's going on?  Hey,  what's up,  Bonet?  Hey.  Yeah,  Philadelphia,  three roles  to listen to Opie and Anthony.  Rule number one,  they always win  in the end.  Yeah,  somehow that always works out.  Rule number two,  easiest way  to get back at Opie  if he ever offends you guys,  vacuum cleaner.  Opie hates the vacuum cleaner sound,  driving him crazy  like nails on a chalkboard.  And number three 
[00:30:30]  is actually a question.  What maternity ward  did you have to go to  last night,  Opie?  Yeah,  we've got to get into  all that eventually.  Thank you, Matt.  I'm going to go listen to Anthony  and call me a tool.  All right.  I'm a tool.  Sandy from Philadelphia,  Anthony.  Yeah,  is this a positive one,  Opie?  Yeah,  we're trying to like  pick out some more positive  instant feedback from Philly.  Yeah,  sure,  this will be one of the  positive ones.  Oh,  right?  Sandy,  what's up?  How long are you guys on  for each day?  Is the music totally gone?  See,  that wasn't too bad.  It was kind of like  until he gets the answer, 
[00:31:00]  which is yes,  we will be here  from three to seven  every day  and you'll hear  like 30 seconds  of songs.  Do you guys  really get paid  for this?  You guys suck.  Pasta from Chestnut Hill.  Well,  yeah,  we do get paid for this.  Fred from Philly,  you guys suck.  Play music,  a-holes.  All right.  There's not going to be music.  You got to just accept that.  Well,  that's not,  we're kind of like  a rock and roll talk show,  though.  No,  there'll be music. 
[00:31:30]  You'll have bands on  occasionally  and you'll hear,  you'll hear the best parts  of the songs  when we come back  from commercials  and stuff like that.  Right.  That's about it.  You know,  we used to play  a little music.  You know,  the most ass-kicking part  of the most  ass-kicking songs.  That's right.  You know?  Yeah,  we call it a little taste.  A little taste.  You just need to get  to the hook  and then move on  with the talk.  Paul,  what's up?  What's up,  douches?  Listen,  let me give those  jerk-offs down in Philly  a little taste of,  you know, 
[00:32:00]  the characters  that they're going to be  coming across  on this show.  Okay.  All right,  a couple of words  about each.  Opie.  All you have to remember  about Opie is  he's a sadistic bastard.  Well, yeah.  You're very cruel,  mean-spirited.  He might sound nice  right now,  but...  Thank you.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Kid lover,  but we can't talk  about that  because that's  impending litigation.  Yes,  I've been accused  of being a kid-toucher.  Right.  Black Earl?  Mm-hmm.  Lazy.  Yeah.  Black Earl who,  yes,  he is an African-American,  but he's called  Black Earl  because he wears 
[00:32:30]  all black.  Where is Earl?  We should introduce  Earl to Philadelphia.  He's doing a sticker  stop somewhere  along the pike.  Earl is a guy  that's really  busting apart  the African-American  stereotypes.  Sure.  Earl's been with  this radio station  forever.  Yeah.  We can't fire him  because, you know,  it fills our EOE quota.  Right.  Let's go down the list,  shall we?  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to explain Earl.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We call him Black Earl  because the guy  wears nothing but black  every single day  of his life.  Black pants,  black shirt,  black hat,  his closet's full of them. 
[00:33:00]  He's like a cartoon character,  like Fred Flintstone.  You know,  he's just got that one outfit  and that's it.  And we tried to put a  Philly's hat on him today.  He really lost his ass,  not because it was a Philly's hat,  but because it was red.  Yeah.  You've got to understand,  this guy has red underwear,  red,  black underwear,  black socks,  and he's a virgin  and a flaming homosexual.  And he has the gay finger,  right.  Which leads me  into my next question.  All right,  go ahead, Paul.  Rick.  Yeah, Rick is...  One word, wait,  one word. 
[00:33:30]  Yep.  Faggot.  Thank you.  What is...  Rick is...  That's great.  Rick is a married man.  Rick is the producer  of our radio show  and does a fine job.  Thank you.  He does have a peeler,  though.  According to...  I do not.  According to Jay Moore.  Jay didn't see it.  Speaking of Jay Moore.  Jay Moore is a fan  of our show.  A friend of the show,  I should remember.  He will only come in  if he's doing  the comedy shack  somewhere in Trenton.  Right.  But Jay supposedly  saw Rick's junk  and he claims 
[00:34:00]  that Rick has a peeler.  Keep the night out.  And one more thing  before I go listen  to myself on the radio.  They will learn  to love the Diceman.  Hey, kiss my ass, okay?  All right,  I'm going to go listen  to myself, too.  Okay.  It's just a matter of time  before Dice gets on our show.  Earl.  Hello, you.  Is there anything  you want to say to Philly?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Earl's first words to Philly.  Excuse me  while I whip this out.  How are you doing, Earl? 
[00:34:30]  I'm fine.  Look at you,  saying hi to Philly.  Everyone's got a little  hop in their step  for this.  This is a big day.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Earl.  You're going to go bad.  He's going to bore Philly as well.  Earl.  That's your opening words  to Philadelphia.  I said hello, Philly,  but I got Clevon Little.  Oh, my God.  This is all you're going  to get from Earl.  Don't expect anything  more from Earl  than this.  Just babble. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  All right, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Great job.  Yeah.  Earl is a 30...  How old are you?  I'm 31.  31-year-old virgin.  Hardly.  And we don't really know  what he does around here  at our radio station.  He's been here for years,  does nothing.  But he's a friend.  Like a roach.  And his new nickname  is Shrek.  Yeah.  If you want to know  what Earl looks like,  go see Shrek.  Instead of green, 
[00:35:30]  just imagine brownish.  And that's what he looks like.  Right.  He looks like the black Shrek.  Right.  You ever see Blackula  when they made Dracula black?  It was Dracula,  but he was black.  It's like Black Shrek.  Same thing.  Bobby Bonilla.  That's what he looks like.  What are you doing  for the rest of the day?  Well, I have paperwork to do.  What are you doing  for the rest of the day?  Seriously.  R.G. Kennedy.  Earl?  See you.  Earl?  Comment. 
[00:36:00]  The Lordy Lord,  he's desperate.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Earl?  Earl, comment.  What are you doing  for the rest of the day?  Actually, I was...  Well, they...  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  And if you haven't noticed already,  he's the whitest black guy ever.  Right.  See, like the brothers  are so upset with Earl  being the representative.  The brothers can kiss my ass.  Whoa!  Hey, hey, look at that.  Hey.  All right.  Dawn, what's going on?  The New York one.  This is cracking me up. 
[00:36:30]  Why?  Because I remember you guys  the first week you were on  begging for people to listen.  You were yelling down the hallways  looking for someone  within the building  to talk to you.  Right.  You know,  is anyone there?  Thank you.  Everyone went to the movies  at 4 o'clock.  Yeah, Dawn,  this kind of grows on you  like a fungus, right?  I'm telling you,  it absolutely does.  I'm psyched you guys are there  because I work out  in, like,  towards Trenton,  so now I'll be able  to get you in clear.  So, guys,  everyone just listen  and hang in there. 
[00:37:00]  Believe me,  you won't be able  to turn it off.  All right.  Thank you, Dawn.  Sure.  Bye.  There you go.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Nick.  Hey, Nick,  what's going on?  Yo, ONA,  how are you?  All right.  Philly,  I got some advice for you.  Listening to ONA  is like hanging out  with your buddies.  You may not laugh  every minute,  but when you do laugh,  you'll laugh your head off,  so you might as well  get on board now 
[00:37:30]  because you're going  to come on board later.  And sometimes  you have to drive us home  when we're really drunk  and we throw up in the car.  Yeah, that's right.  Just like your best pal.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  You got it.  I'm just trying to go through  some more of the instant feedback,  Anthony.  It's the getting-to-know-you phase.  You want to hear some more  from Philadelphia?  Yeah, they've got to be  getting better already.  It's been 45 minutes.  Yeah, there's been a few  chuckles on this show.  Reggie from  Are You Guys on Crack?  What the F are you guys? 
[00:38:00]  Serious?  YSP used to be  a respectable station  until you fools came on today.  I'm scared for life.  You guys suck.  Jesus Christ.  Take your white asses  back to New York.  Mixtape Master from Philly.  Play some goddamn cheap trick  or lick the sweat  off the back of my A.  I love the dream police.  Rob from Philly.  You guys are terrible.  I want Cousin Ed back.  Shut the hell up  and play some music already.  Yeah.  You won't last a month.  Oh, we heard that one before.  Oh, that you won't last?  We ought to pull out.  I know we have a couple 
[00:38:30]  of calls from  very early  in our tenure here  in New York  where we were just  getting beaten.  Right.  So we're very used to it.  Don't worry about it.  John just writes  on the S&P back  Pearl Jam  a thousand times.  Pearl Jam,  Pearl Jam,  Pearl Jam.  Mark from Philly.  Hmm.  Black Earl.  Really funny.  Not.  Well, we agree there.  We agree.  There's nothing funny about it.  That's comedy kryptonite.  The Seinfeld bit  funny four years ago.  Please get something  that will at least  make me grimace 
[00:39:00]  a little bit.  Please.  If this were a boxing match,  they'd stop it.  All right.  Play some Stones  or I'm going to go listen  to the other rock station.  Three to seven.  Are they out of their minds?  You guys suck.  This is death row  for W-Y-S-P.  Death row?  Any good ones  in there, Opie?  I'm looking at it.  I'm looking.  Dan from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  They want some music.  Give it to them.  Stephen Lynch tunes. 
[00:39:30]  The Insect song.  How about the ACDC parody?  We should play  a Stephen Lynch song  for them.  Yeah.  I think Stephen's  going to be in late.  Stephen Lynch is coming in  with some brand new songs today.  Yeah.  And he's going to go  to the party with us tonight.  So, yeah, we can play it.  Which one do you want  to play for them?  Special Olympics?  That's a good one.  That'll make them  cringe a little bit.  Or how about  the gerbil song?  Let's go with  the gerbil song.  Just walked out  of my house  to my car  and deleted YSP  from my presets.  You guys suck. 
[00:40:00]  Well, the purge  has begun.  It happened.  What are you going  to do about it?  All right.  Let me go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  Just wanted to call  and say congratulations.  Oh, thank you, Frank.  With the move.  I want to let  the people of Philadelphia  know that they may  not be hearing  Aerosmith and Rock  that much,  but they will be  hearing a lot of  Van Halen in the future.  Ah, the Van Halen.  We should explain that.  We're on a really  long delay  because our bosses  don't trust us.  And when it gets  really, really bad,  they hit a button 
[00:40:30]  and a Van Halen  song comes on.  Yeah, so if you ever  hear the show  and then all of a sudden  it cuts off  and goes to Van Halen,  it means that we've  been removed from the air.  Correct.  For saying something.  Thank you, bro.  Let's go to George.  George, what's going on?  Hey, George.  This is Felix.  Felix, what's up?  Hey, yo.  Thank God  you guys made it to Philly.  All right.  Well.  It's about time.  Talk to the Philly people.  I'm tired of hearing  the ONA  through the phone.  My cousin lives up 
[00:41:00]  in New York  and he always puts me  through the phone  and I'm always listening  to these guys  through the phone.  That's the best way  to hear us.  Someone in Philly  is in shock going,  someone actually,  you know,  uses their long-distance  service to listen  to this talk?  Yo, it's worth  every bit.  Let me tell you,  Philly will learn  to love you.  All right, Felix.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Pete.  Like your first swig  of scotch,  your first drag  of a cigarette.  Makes you sick,  doesn't it?  Almost makes you  want to vomit.  You don't like it.  But years later,  you're still smoking  and you're still drinking  and it'll kill you  eventually, 
[00:41:30]  just like this show.  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, are you from Philly?  No, I'm from New York.  One of the New York listeners  and I have a question  for you.  Why do you two guys  sound like a Boy Scout  at a NAMBLO convention today?  Why?  You're so tight  and like nervous  and silly.  I don't think  we're nervous.  No, it's just  the getting to know phase  which isn't really  part of the show  that we've done before.  You know,  usually we get in  and we just start  rolling with the show  but we have to actually 
[00:42:00]  get on  and say hi to Philly,  read some of the hate mail  and then we move on.  Yeah, we're going to move on.  You should bring  old Dirty in.  Everyone's going to  meet everybody eventually.  We're not going to come in  though and start  introducing people  like a receiving line.  You know,  I think we blew it  by starting with Earl.  Yeah.  That was bad.  Yeah, but you don't want  to start with the A-bomb.  We have a whole cast  of characters  and we chose Earl  to represent everyone. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Philly,  here's Earl.  He's boring.  He has nothing to say.  He's a weak opener.  You'll hate him  as much as we do.  There you go.  Now we need  the big closer.  The big middle  and the big closer.  We couldn't start  with like Sandy Kane  or, you know,  or Jim Norton  or Big Butt Mendy.  We had to go with Earl  who had nothing to say.  Nothing.  You're going to have  to explain all those  little sound effects  and, you know.  Yeah, we got Jim Norton  coming in in a little while.  Sandy Kane, I think,  is going to be on the show 
[00:43:00]  next week.  Next week.  Yeah, you've got to  check this woman out.  She was in.  Just a little,  let's introduce you  to little Sandy Kane.  She was in last time.  She's this 75-year-old  stripper,  public access TV star.  Right.  She's disgusting.  From vaudeville.  Yeah, like vaudeville days.  She's disgusting.  Not even an attractive  older woman.  Just putrid.  And she loves  taking her clothes off.  So she came in  and wanted to do  a little exotic dance. 
[00:43:30]  She had a big hemorrhoid.  And she was not shy  about telling everybody  she had this big hemorrhoid.  So we invited a listener  to come down  to apply Preparation H  directly to her roid.  And she's fine with it.  And a listener came in.  He puts a rubber glove on.  Takes a finger.  Puts Preparation H on it.  And applies it  to her hemorrhoid.  At which point  Sandy Kane  made this sound.  Oh!  His one finger.  What's the actual sound?  One finger.  She just, oh! 
[00:44:00]  She made that sound.  I love that.  That's not a man's voice.  No.  That wasn't quite enough.  So we told him  to lube up two fingers.  And really,  really get her.  And she was talking  during this part.  And you could hear  the exact point  that he made contact.  Correct.  Oh!  Yeah.  Eh, eh, eh.  Here it is.  Oh!  I don't believe it.  There it is.  I got my sounds  mixed up.  I'll be.  She was saying,  I don't believe something.  And then when the 
[00:44:30]  preparation age  made contact,  she said,  I don't believe it.  Right.  Doesn't that sound  just like somebody  getting stuck?  I don't believe it.  And then the last one  was two fingers  straight up to the  third knuckle.  Ow!  She made that sound.  Ow!  All right.  We're going to take  a break, Anthony.  Yes.  I don't believe it.  We do have lots  to do today.  The retarded  Laverne Shirley  coming in today.  Oh, boy.  They want to congratulate us  on the syndication deal  and stuff.  Oh, great.  We can make fun  of Marion's  horrendous perm 
[00:45:00]  a little bit more.  Hop on,  Mark,  do.  And Jim Norton  coming in  and Steve Richards  from the WWF  is calling in today.  He choked opiate  about two weeks ago.  Yeah,  I got a bone  to pick with him.  He choked me out  a couple weeks ago  for real  and we haven't  talked to him since.  As we go to break,  something from  the O&A archives.  Stephen Lynch  coming in as well  to do some  brand new songs  for us today.  But here's one  from the archives.  This one is  called Gerbil.  I bought a gerbil 
[00:45:30]  at the petting zoo.  If Richard Gere  can do it,  I can too.  I get undressed,  I start to lube.  I stick the gerbil  in the end  of the tube.  Wondering just  how he'll feel.  Will he like it  better than  his little wheel?  Careful now,  he's right beside me.  One more inch  and he's inside me. 
[00:46:00]  Go!  Gerbil  go!  Burrow harder,  burrow deeper.  Be my little  chimney sweeper.  One thing I forgot  about how am I  supposed to get you  out.  How am I supposed  to get you out? 
[00:46:30]  So now my gerbil's  on easy street.  It's warm and cozy  and there's plenty  to eat.  The situation  is beyond my control.  Gotta find a way  to get him  out of his hole.  I try crowbars,  I try wires,  I almost hurt him  with a pair of pliers.  I try cheese,  but he's not fighting.  I wish this wasn't 
[00:47:00]  so exciting.  Go!  Gerbil  go!  Go!  Jesus, I am  such a sucker.  Please get out,  you furry.  I think I am  getting ill.  Suddenly,  he's very,  very  still. 
[00:47:30]  Now it's too late,  my gerbil died.  I guess I have  committed gerbil side.  Here's some advice.  It's very clear cut.  If you love your gerbil,  don't stick him up your butt.  Don't stick him up your butt.  There's a very gerbil  in your buddy home. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  Wow.  The gerbil song.  Thank you.  The only time  you'll ever hear that  on the radio.  Hope you taped it.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW is  The Sports Guys  at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7. 
[00:48:30]  Next time,  on a very special  Ron and Fez.  Time is running out.  Hang in there,  Fez.  I'm not going to make it,  Ron.  You're going to make it.  Help is on the way.  It's delayed.  Just hold on.  See?  I told you.  The pizza's here.  You need extra cheese now.  All on the next  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Midday,  noon to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour. 
[00:49:00]  By Opie and Anthony.  Herbie, New Jersey,  Connecticut,  Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's your music.  There you go.  We're very excited today.  It's our first day live  in Philadelphia, Anthony.  Yeah.  On WYSP.  And we have so much  instant feedback coming in.  I guess they linked  instant feedback 
[00:49:30]  to the WYSP website.  Yeah.  So, you know,  you can comment about the show  as we go along.  And we read it.  It comes right into  the studio here.  Anthony, there's so much  instant feedback coming in  that we have  crashed websites all over.  The whole New York is down.  People very excited.  They want to comment, Opie.  Well, we got some comments  in front of me here.  Oh, it didn't crash  before you could get  a few more out?  No.  Thank God.  Josephine from Willow Grove.  Who are you?  Don't you know  this is a rock music station? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, boy.  We are not interested  in your obnoxious  New York garbage.  It may work there  where everyone is insane enough  to pay $4,000  for a broom closet  apartment,  but it will never work  here in Philadelphia.  You won't be on the air long.  I hope someone's  taping this show today.  Yeah.  Bert,  WYSP's program director  should be lynched.  You guys suck.  Lynching?  Colleen from Delaware,  get off the air.  You guys suck.  I want to hear music.  Eric Schmitz, 
[00:50:30]  ooh,  some childish sound effects  and a song about  a gerbil in the A.  How freaking mature.  Sure.  I'm trying to get  my nine-year-old son  into some good music  and you come along  and screw it all up.  I am never, ever, ever  listening to WYSP again.  You've lost another listener.  Pretty soon,  your advertisers will be gone.  Goodbye, good riddance.  She was a whore.  Another childish sound effect.  I can't take another  effing minute of this.  And finally,  you guys are more brain-dead  than Eric Lindros 
[00:51:00]  after his eighth concussion.  Your first 45 minutes in Philly  were an infomercial  for Boring Radio.  All right.  All right.  That one had a little promise.  It's kind of funny.  All right.  My God.  Anthony,  Gay Marco is standing by.  Gay Marco.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, bud?  Hello, Philadelphia.  City of brotherly love.  I love a city  that promotes gay incest.  Gay Marco. 
[00:51:30]  I don't even know  what to say about this guy.  Hey.  He called up one day  when we had Jay Moore  on the show.  Hollywood actor Jay Moore.  You may have seen him  in Jerry Maguire.  My hero.  You probably saw him  in Mafia.  You probably saw him  hacking it up in Mafia.  And Gay Marco  in love with Jay Moore.  So we had him come in one day  and Jay drew targets  on his ass  and whipped him.  And we haven't been able  to get rid of him.  Hey.  He's a flaming fag. 
[00:52:00]  Marco,  you have anything  to say to Philly?  Welcome to Philadelphia.  Earl completely blew it.  I know.  I was listening.  Don't say blow it  in front of Gay Marco.  Right.  We brought Earl in  and he had nothing  for Philadelphia today.  Nothing whatsoever.  Yeah.  We should tell everyone  that Marco  for NSYNC tickets,  his favorite band,  who do you like again,  JC?  JC.  Oh my God.  I went to the concert  this week.  Oh my God.  I started crying  when they came out.  Who doesn't? 
[00:52:30]  This concert  was an event.  Baggot.  Oh my God.  It was like,  I've never seen  anything like it.  I'm still quivering  from it.  Oh God.  What was your best  part of the concert,  Marco?  The very beginning.  Oh my God.  God,  I was like,  I was like,  a little bag.  And then they disappeared  and then they reappeared.  Oh my God,  I started crying.  You are so gay.  Now,  you won tickets  on this show  a while back.  For last year's concert.  Yeah,  for last year's concert. 
[00:53:00]  Tell everyone  what you had to do  to win those tickets.  Well,  you were having  a contest  what would you do  for NSYNC tickets?  Yeah.  And I called up  and I said  that I would  eat a girl's peach.  Right.  Eat a peach  for the NSYNC tickets,  right Marco?  Yes.  And you're so gay  that you've never even  done anything like that  before.  You've barely seen  a naked woman.  I've never seen  a live naked woman  before.  And he,  he went right to work.  It was horrible. 
[00:53:30]  And the girl said  it was the worst  oral experience  she's ever had  to sit through.  The drool  was just ridiculous.  Yeah,  he wouldn't want to,  he didn't want  to ingest anything  so he's just drooling  like a cat  with distemper  or something.  He's just laying  there drooling.  Oh!  Well,  he had his mouth open  and he was just  bobbing up and down.  Yeah.  Yeah,  that's what he's  used to doing.  So when she,  when she finally  took off her panties,  you screamed.  Oh, 
[00:54:00]  I almost passed out.  He couldn't take it.  He wasn't expecting  it to look like that.  Yeah,  he screamed,  what is that?  What is that?  There's stuff hanging out!  I now know  why they call it  a clam  because I saw a clam  when I was in gay Disney.  I was like,  oh my God,  it does look like that.  How was your trip  to gay Disney?  Oh,  it was fabulous.  Fabulous.  I didn't break my record.  Yeah,  we talked to you  last week  about gay Disney.  What else happened  since we last talked to you?  Well,  I didn't break my record  of sex  on Disney rides,  which my record  is 12. 
[00:54:30]  12 rides  you had gay sex on?  Yes.  That's my record.  What rides are they?  All over the park,  you know,  different ones.  I tried it  on Space Mountain,  it was impossible.  But the easiest ones  are the ones  at Epcot  because they go very slow.  They're like retard rides.  So,  isn't that great  when you go to Disney,  you never know  if some guy  was just doing  some of the butt  in the seat  you're sitting in?  I only had  sex nine times  this time  on Disney parks. 
[00:55:00]  What happens?  I was in that little  Mexican ride there  in Epcot  and all of a sudden  I started smelling  this musky smell.  And my kid  was chewing  on the railing  that holds him  into the car  and said  it tasted like  a dirty penny.  Marco,  what are you doing?  You're like  fouling the rides.  It was fun  with a really good time.  How many different  guys did you have  sex with?  In four days,  I think,  eleven?  Eleven guys 
[00:55:30]  in four days?  No, no, no,  wait, wait, wait,  wait, it was five days.  It was five days.  It looked like  a cannoli  laying there.  And they had  all these holy rollers.  Like,  as you were driving  into the park,  you were all out  in front with their signs  like,  gays go home  and it was so scary.  But you didn't  try to talk them  into the gay lifestyle.  Oh, please,  they were nasty.  They were like  southern white trash,  you know,  with all the big  fat people  with their fat children, 
[00:56:00]  you know,  all wearing Kmart clothes.  Oh, wait,  I'm sorry.  Jay Marco,  you gotta think,  a lot of these guys  plan this vacation  for years.  They take their kids there.  They're not expecting  to get on rides  where guys  have an anal.  What are you doing?  One weekend,  we get to  take over the park  and these people  have to come  and like infiltrate  our ranks.  Gay makes you  sound a little  happy and everything.  Meanwhile,  you're sitting down  and you don't know  what you're sitting in.  All right,  well, Marco,  you got anything else  for Philly today?  I write a weekly column 
[00:56:30]  on foundrymusic.com,  oh, bi-weekly,  I'm sorry,  I'm bi-weekly now.  Of course it's bi-weekly.  It swings both ways,  boys and men.  And I write a bi-weekly column  on foundrymusic.com  and you can access  all my columns  from January  and find out  all sorts of information  about me.  Great.  It's all about you, Marco.  It's all about me  and NSYNC.  All right.  The Toad's Wild Colon.  Thank you, Marco.  Okay, bye.  All right.  Welcome to the fabulous  world of Marco's Colon 
[00:57:00]  brought to you by Monsanto.  Virgin.  Celine,  what's going on?  Hi.  Hi, Celine.  You're calling from Jersey?  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  Not much.  No?  No.  What do you want to do?  Tell everybody.  Well, I was calling  to play  Guess What's In My Pants.  All right.  Yes.  Finally.  Finally.  I think that could bring  some people together today.  Yeah, I figure, you know,  it's the first time  for syndication, 
[00:57:30]  so it's like,  what's the first?  Guess What's In My Pants.  Let me explain it.  Celine is on the phone.  We will instruct her  to take her phone  and rub it  on a certain area.  In various different ways.  And from the sound  that it makes  over the phone,  we can tell  what kind of hairstyle  she's sporting.  Done this thousands of times.  We're very professionals.  Celine.  Yes.  So, where are you right now?  Right now,  I'm in between clients. 
[00:58:00]  So, you're in your car?  Actually, yes, I am.  I'm in my car.  What, do you pull over  to the side of the road?  Yeah, I'm in a quiet area.  In a quiet area?  And what are you wearing today?  Right now,  I'm just wearing shorts  and a T-shirt.  All right.  And what, blonde hair?  No, brunette.  Brunette.  Nice.  That's telling  when she rubs the phone  down there  if it's coarser hair.  You've got to  describe yourself, Celine.  I'm 5'4".  Uh-huh.  About 120. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  And I have  34,  34, 36 feet.  Nice.  All right.  Have you done some  wowing with those babies?  Not too much  this year yet, no.  All right.  We're just getting  into the wow season, so.  Right.  All right, Celine.  Are you ready to do this?  Yes, I am.  Do you know what I mean?  All right.  Celine, make sure  you don't tell us  what hairstyle you're sporting  until we ask you.  Right.  Don't give any clues  when we guess.  We've got to play  the theme song, though.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Hold on, Celine. 
[00:59:00]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my past?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my past?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  All right, Celine.  Uh-huh.  We will ask you to rub the phone.  The choices, for any new listeners out there, is a full triangle, which is just natural. 
[00:59:30]  The mohawk, which is the strip up the middle.  A lot of strippers.  Very popular hairstyle there.  The Hitler mustache, which is the mohawk that has been shaved down from the top to the bottom.  Or the wood floor, or as we like to call it, the JonBenet Ramsey, which is completely waxed or shaved.  All right, Celine, if you would take the phone and, in an up-and-down fashion, rub away. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Let's listen.  Oh, my God.  It's like 30-grit sandpaper.  Oh, look at that, Celine.  Can I hear that again?  Up and down.  Up and down.  Yeah, hold on.  All right.  I got it.  Sounds like those Weather Channel reports from a hurricane.  Right.  All right, Celine, if you would side to side. 
[01:00:30]  Okay.  Hmm, interesting.  It's a little different than I would have expected.  Well, we still need the circular motion.  Of course.  Celine, if you would now, any circular motion all over the area.  Okay.  Hmm.  See, I thought after the up-and-down I had this, but I'm not sure.  Celine, one more time with the circular motion.  Okay.  Yes. 
[01:01:00]  Now I'm starting to think a big pool table rack full of Afro hair.  It looks like your flaps are a little, sound a little different.  All right, Bill.  And do you need to hear any more?  Maybe the side to side one more time?  Yeah, that's the most telling one.  Side to side one more time, Celine.  If you will.  Oh, okay.  That high frequency threw me off there.  All right.  All right.  Well, people are going to call me crazy, but I've done this for a while. 
[01:01:30]  I'm going to say the JonBenet Ramsey.  Now, don't tell us.  I'm going to say JonBenet Ramsey.  Opie, you're a guess, Opie.  Um, hmm.  I've got to go with the mohawk today.  You're going with mohawk?  Yeah.  Did you hear a little different sound from the side to side, which is...  Celine, side to side once again.  Okay.  Oh, see?  I'm hearing an inconsistency in the middle of the stroke.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Javier?  I'm going to go with my first instinct and say the wood floor.  Wood floor JonBenet.  Rick?  To you?  Yeah, I've got to go with the wood floor, but in desperate need of a good sanding and wax job.  Yeah.  Like 5 o'clock shadow, like...  Fred Flintstone now.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  Okay, um, Celine, I think we're ready.  If you would tell us, Celine, what is in your pants?  It is the wood floor.  Yeah.  The wood floor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Two for two.  Wow.  My streak is over.  Your streak's over, Opie.  You're usually very good. 
[01:02:30]  I'm surprised you didn't go with the wood floor.  I heard an inconsistency on the side to side stroke.  Yeah.  But I think that might have just been the hubba-bubba getting in the way.  You know what I mean?  It could have been a little of the hubba-bubba.  You got any of the hubba-bubba?  No, not really.  You know, some of them are nice, tight, like a cherry stone clam.  Yeah, that's good.  That's real cold.  And some of them, uh, I don't know, looks like, uh, Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  Of all this...  I thought maybe it bounced off the little Tom's thumb there.  Yeah, it could have been. 
[01:03:00]  See, that sometimes confuses you.  But it is indeed a wood floor.  Celine, thank you so much.  Hey, Celine.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  You want some Aerosmith tickets?  Oh, sure.  All right.  Definitely.  We got a pair of tickets to the, uh, the show at the PNC Arts Center, okay?  Okay, great.  Thank you.  It's a sold-out show.  Also, a few tickets still available for the June 12th show.  Uh, call Ticketmaster if you want to go.  But we got a pair for you, Celine.  Hold on, okay?  Okay, thanks.  She can, uh, she can, uh, she can compare hers to Steven Tyler's lips.  And from the sound of that side-to-side, similarity.  And thanks for playing What's In My Pains. 
[01:03:30]  It's time to play, it's time to play, it's time to play, hey, guess what's in my past?  It's time to play, it's time to play, it's time to play, hey, guess what's in my past?  You're a girl.  There you go.  Anthony.  Fun little game.  Anthony, the instant feedback is working once again.  Yeah, great. 
[01:04:00]  And we got more comments.  It's our first day in Philadelphia today.  Very excited.  Yeah.  And I want to read some more of the instant feedback.  We should get Tim Sabian on the phone once again, the program director of WYSB.  Do we really want to do that at this point?  I imagine that he's getting some fine phone calls about us at his radio station today.  Rick, if we could get him on the phone.  See if he's still very excited about us coming to Philadelphia.  Uh, Cal from Philly.  You guys effin' suck.  Rick, why don't you and the fag you just had on go have gay sex and give us back our rock? 
[01:04:30]  All right.  Philadelphia doesn't want you New York jerk-os effing up our rock.  Uh, Aaron from Philly.  94 was the last good station in the area.  I hope you guys are filling in for an injured employee or something.  God's sake, it was the smartest thing you've played yet.  I am praying you guys are temporary.  Play some straight rock before my radio goes on strike.  Uh, Rich.  Did I just hear NSYNC on WYSP?  You guys should stick to New York, because New York is about the only thing that sucks more 
[01:05:00]  than you.  Ah.  Uh, let's see.  John, oh boy, after five hours of Stern in the morning, I get to hear more JOs in the afternoon.  The program managers at WYSP should be shot.  And Jim from Philly, why are you homos in Philly?  So, um, okay.  Things going great.  So far, so good, right?  Feeling good, feeling good.  Man.  Oh, is that him? 
[01:05:30]  Is that him?  Is he all right?  No.  Hold on, what's up, Rick?  He's a little afraid, and he's like, ah.  Do I have to talk to him now?  Oh, boy.  What's the matter?  He's a little winded, you know, he's a little out of sorts, but I think he's okay now.  Tim.  Uh-oh.  Tim.  I don't want to speak too loudly here.  What's the matter?  I'll be leaving out through the alley door.  Tim, you were so excited an hour and a half.  I was.  What happened?  And I still am.  Okay, what happened?  Oh, please.  Are you fielding a lot of phone calls there? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  We told you about this.  It's called The Purge.  This is The Purge, the first phase.  We're so experienced with this.  When does the binge come?  You should be binging right now.  Don't you worry about a thing.  Okay.  Tim, can you tell us some of the phone calls you're getting so far?  Where's the Van Halen?  Uh-huh.  Where's the Aerosmith?  Uh-huh.  Where's Cousin Ed?  Uh-huh.  These guys suck.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Where's the Van Halen?  Uh-huh.  Where's the Aerosmith?  Uh-huh.  These guys suck.  Uh-huh.  Where's... 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was there one promising call, Tim?  Yes, there was.  Just to give us a little hope?  Yeah.  Ken said, how you doing?  I said, it's going great.  Good.  Ken, of course, the boss of both stations.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  I told you how to be prepared for this.  Absolutely.  Come on.  You're going from music to this drivel?  Let me tell you something.  It's over the top.  It's going all the way to number one.  I think, at this point, Tim's like, oh, my God, they don't do anything.  Oh, no.  What happened? 
[01:07:00]  What happened?  They said it was a fun show.  I don't know what happened.  Wait.  I thought they did things.  Did we get the Opie and Anthony or one of them?  Like Gallagher 2?  You know how Gallagher goes out and his brother goes out as Gallagher 2?  Did we get Opie and Anthony 2?  Yeah.  So when did the real Opie and Anthony show up?  Yeah.  When did they smash the watermelon?  He's thinking to himself, because he heard the whole show yesterday.  But maybe they're just still hung over from those nine bottles of champagne today. 
[01:07:30]  You want us to do some shots of Jaeger?  Oh, let's go.  Yeah, you're ready.  Let's slam them.  I'll do that.  Set them up.  Let's knock them down.  All right, Tim.  We're going to check in from time to time just to make sure everything's okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You know what he's going to be like by the end of the show?  Picture this.  Remember in Jaws, remember the mayor of Amity when he finally signed the thing to let Quint hunt  the shark?  And Brody got it to him at the hospital when he was saying, I'm sorry, my kid was in the 
[01:08:00]  water, too, Brody.  That's going to be him, just walking around like a blithering idiot.  He's just going to be mumbling to himself.  But I heard that he worked in New York.  I figured we signed.  Hello?  Anthony, they're saying we've got a positive call on the line.  Yes, Chris.  From Billy.  Chris, I'm calling from Newton.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm listening off 94.1.  Yeah, that would be WYSP and Phil.  Yeah, I was in my car.  I'm listening to kind of get some music on, and I hear this crap.  Okay.  Are you going to be spinning records at all?  Yeah, a little bit, sure. 
[01:08:30]  You're spinning them in front of us.  Because I don't need, why do you have to talk all that much?  You're not even saying anything important.  Oh.  Exactly.  You got the show now.  It's just our first silly listener that figured out the show.  I just want to hear some music, and then I get this garbage.  Chris, what can we play for you today?  What do you want to hear?  How about the Van Halen?  Ah.  Or is that too much of a problem?  You haven't heard enough Van Halen in your life, or what?  Why don't you just play some?  It's a music station.  Maybe you should play some music.  But haven't you heard all the Van Halen?  Well, look, you've got Cousin Ed on, and then you've got this crap. 
[01:09:00]  If you play some music, why can't you?  Cousin Ed's still rocking, sure.  Why can't we play music?  You know, sir, why don't you get into a warm bath, open your veins, and play Brown Eyed  Girl, you white trash rock and roll lovers.  Shut up.  What the hell was that?  Hey, get Norton to the studio.  Yeah, why don't you talk about something interesting?  Play some music, at least.  Play some music.  Yeah, you know, it was funny the first time I heard it.  Drink A's at a picnic.  Hey, Chris.  Yeah.  You name What's in My Pants?  I was trying, you know, it would be cool if I hadn't heard it a thousand times on other 
[01:09:30]  shows before.  Oh, I don't think you've heard that before.  You've heard What's in My Pants?  That's very similar.  You've heard Woodfloor and Mohawk and that's an old Benet Ramsey?  Yeah.  I'm insulted because that's an O&A original.  Yeah, it's the first time anybody's done something like that.  Of course, Chris.  Get the hell out of here.  All right.  I'm here to talk to you.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  We'll be looking forward to Chris's calls in weeks to come.  That's right.  Because they always call back.  Jim, for the love of God, help us out.  Jim Norton.  What's wrong, Jim? 
[01:10:00]  One of our favorite pals.  Before I do it, I just got to thank the two Port Authority cops that made me make the  left on 8th Avenue.  They told me, thank us on the air, and I'm thanking them on the air.  I wasn't listening to the left on 8th, and they allowed me to because I was running late,  so thank you.  Cool.  Wow.  That's a funny way to start out my appearance.  Busy taking aim on some ethnic, I'm sure, to be bothered with you.  Jim, we should get you up to speed.  First day in Philadelphia, and so far the response, interesting.  Yeah, I've heard some of it.  Interesting. 
[01:10:30]  It's mixed, I think, to say the least.  It's mixed between people that hate us and want us off and want us dead.  So it's a mixed response.  We're happy with that.  Philly will catch on.  It's all right.  People just got to get used to it.  You know, they used to hear music at the South.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  Thank you.  But there's so many, like, music stations.  Yeah, I know, but you can't get enough classic rock, you know.  I mean, I like CD players, don't know.  You know, then you hear what you want.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Stay away to heaven.  You need to hear that again and again and again.  You know. 
[01:11:00]  Brian, what's going on?  What's up, bud?  Hey.  No, I just want to say, F everybody wants to hear that Van Halen.  They can go buy the CD if they want it.  We need you guys.  Are you from?  You guys rock.  Are you from Philly?  Yeah.  Is this the first day ever listening to us?  No, I used to listen to you through a buddy of mine up in North Jersey.  He'd bring me down tapes.  I did some Napster stuff.  Yeah, we have a lot of stuff on Napster.  Yeah, but, I mean, we need you guys.  You're a breath of fresh air, and you're going to keep everybody rocking during the day.  All right.  Thanks, Brian.  Thanks, bud.  We're the only artists not blocked from Napster because we don't care. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, we don't care.  Download this stuff.  Jim, you all right, though?  You look a little...  Yeah, man.  I'm not dressed properly for tonight, either.  I really have no good clothes.  I got jeans on for a penthouse party.  I need clothes.  You're going to the penthouse party, too?  Yeah.  I didn't know you were going.  How do you miss that?  You invited me.  I did, or...?  Yeah, you did.  I got the thing here, too.  Oh, okay.  What would be more important than going to the penthouse party?  Nothing.  I just don't have good clothes.  It's depressing.  What did you think?  If you were going to dress up, you were going to skate out with a penthouse pet?  You must be really... 
[01:12:00]  The nicer the slags, the easier it is to hide a pistol.  Jim, I got to tell you, we were hanging out with the penthouse pets yesterday.  Yeah, I know.  It sucked.  They didn't show anything, right?  They're beautiful and stuff, but no.  Yeah.  And the pet of the year doesn't speak English.  That's better.  And she kept giving us this look like I'm picturing the Philly listeners are looking at  their radios.  You know, that kind of what the...  Yeah, they'll get used to it.  Don't worry.  No, we're not worried.  Yeah.  We'll do just fine.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Well, we could introduce Philadelphia to Butt Plug. 
[01:12:30]  More mature comedy from Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, this is comedy with a more mature edge.  Sure.  Sure.  It's a little gag we like to call Butt Plug.  Yeah.  Play it at home.  We call like department stores and all they say is Butt Plug.  Yeah, this is funny, right?  Absolutely.  I got it.  It took an hour and a half to start doubting ourselves.  We've been doing this for seven years together.  It's all new.  It's the weird...  This is the weirdest day of my life.  Yeah.  The calls are funny, though, coming in. 
[01:13:00]  The hate calls are great.  Hey, you gotta love them.  I did enjoy some.  Jim.  I haven't heard one hate call.  Well, I'm just trying to get my son into his rock and roll.  He's going to give a gerbil song.  Why don't you get your son into gerbils, stupid?  All right.  Here's Butt Plug again.  Yes, we'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Are you okay?  Yeah, it's Butt Plugs.  Who?  Butt Plugs.  Butt Plugs, yes, ma'am.  How can I help you?  Butt Plugs. 
[01:13:30]  What is it?  Butt Plugs.  A what box?  Butt Plugs.  A Butt Box?  Butt Plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt Plugs.  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Butt Plugs.  Butt...  Butt Box?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt Plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt Plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello?  What are you looking for?  Butt Plug.  Spark Plug.  What kind? 
[01:14:00]  Butt Plug.  What kind of a spark plug?  No, Butt Plug.  I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  Butt Plug?  A spark plug.  Butt Plug.  Bug Plug?  Butt Plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt Plug.  Huh?  Butt Plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug.  Yeah.  Butt Lug?  Butt Plug.  I know, Butt.  But what do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to fix...  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, okay.  I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs.  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug.  Butt?  Butt Plug.  Sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want.  Butt Plug.  Butt Plug.  I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt Plug?  Yeah.  We don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:15:00]  O.B.  Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  Ah, Anthony.  Yes, O.B.  Stadium Auto Mall.  Wouldn't it be great if the phone company let you pay a bill three months late?  Or how about the cable company?  In six months, you pay your bill.  Stadium Auto Mall.  You can drive away today and not pay a dime until 2002.  How cool is that?  Any car or truck on Stadium's giant 10-acre lot.  Available with no down payment, no security deposit, no payments until 2002. 
[01:15:30]  Stadium Auto Mall in Rutherford, New Jersey.  Says, come on in.  Drive home today in a new Jeep or drive home in a new Ford car, truck, or SUV.  And don't even think about making payments until 2002.  Same deal applies to new gay woos and even used cars and trucks.  Leave the money in the bank or use it for summer vacation.  Whatever.  Don't worry about credit problems either.  They don't say no over there.  Stadium Auto Mall says, you're approved.  Take a vacation with the payments.  And get your next car or truck at the incredible Stadium Auto Mall with no payments until 2002.  Route 17 North, Rutherford, New Jersey.  Call them up, 201-935-2400. 
[01:16:00]  201-935-2400.  See their ads in the Star Ledger or the Bergen Record for details.  O.B. Anthony.  1027.  WNW.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Helping us out as we debut our syndicated radio show.  Live in Philadelphia today.  He's our pit bull. 
[01:16:30]  In case we need to release the hay.  It is really funny.  People are just up in arms in Philadelphia.  Making in some feedback to show.  Yeah.  We had to bring in a huge garbage pail to deal with all the paper that is coming into the studio today.  Why don't you take the show and put it in that garbage pail?  It's amazing.  Yeah, we're getting a lot of feedback.  Hey, we're getting a reaction and we're going through the instant feedback and we're picking out the ones that are supporting us. 
[01:17:00]  We are?  Oh, yeah.  No, we are.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  B from Philadelphia.  You guys already don't play any music, so it's great to see you decide to eliminate more of that wasteful use of airtime and fill it with even more useless dribble.  All right.  Second one that wrote dribble.  Or is that word too big for your comprehension?  Even more.  Even more reason to stick with WMMR, a real rock station that actually plays rock music. 
[01:17:30]  There you go.  If you want to hear Van Halen, go ahead.  Barley.  I'd rather light my farts from 3 to 7 in the afternoon than listen to this crap.  It would probably be more entertaining.  Walt from Philly.  My God, why?  That's it?  Simple three words.  Well, my view.  My God, why?  Dan the Man from Philly.  Please die and go to hell. 
[01:18:00]  Stacy from Long Beach Island, New Jersey.  Ahua.  This was the only good station I got because I'm in the middle of effing nowhere.  Maybe if I drink as much as you guys, I'll think this S is funny.  There's a star.  You can try that.  Well, how white trash are you when you only live just and you get one radio station when  you live somewhere?  You are garbage and you live in a trailer.  We don't need you to listen.  Because you're stupid.  What's in my pants?  Your father. 
[01:18:30]  Jesus, Norton.  Jim, we're trying to win them over today.  Win their hearts and minds.  I'm not being nice either.  I genuinely like Philadelphia.  They are animals in Philadelphia.  People like that really annoy me.  We got one station in.  I hope you have a miscarriage.  I thought we were doing well today.  I came in with my Allen Iverson shirt.  I hate the Sixers.  I like Philadelphia.  I hate the Sixers.  I'm a Laker fan.  No BS.  I'm rooting for the Sixers.  No, I know.  I'm rooting for LA.  Allen Iverson came on strong last night.  48 points. 
[01:19:00]  Amazing.  Oh, he did?  Great.  Good.  Has somebody, Ken Stevens, left the building yet?  Has he fled the building?  Ken, yeah.  He ran out of here to take a plane to Philly.  Did he?  To deal with the carnage down there.  No joke.  He goes, I think they need my help.  I got to go.  Oh.  He was the one that put this wonderful idea together.  So you can blame him.  How cold are the beers?  In the fridge.  We've been on the air for what?  An hour and 40 minutes?  Yeah, that might be part of the problem.  It's time to crack a few. 
[01:19:30]  We're changing our ways.  I think we've got to stick with our...  Yeah, get John to get a couple of beers.  Hey, Alex, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  I have a question.  Yes, Alex.  I'm a New York listener.  I'm kind of up in arms in reverse for the Philadelphia people.  Why?  Why should we give them the courtesy of listening to all the bits and getting them all cheap?  I listened to you guys for two and a half years and listened to all the bits.  I know what they're from.  It's like a history that we have.  Right.  And they just get to hear them like half-aidedly. 
[01:20:00]  Well, Alex, it's a weird day because we're used to just entertaining New York.  New York understands the show, really participates in the show.  That's what we really do different than anyone else.  The listeners are very important to what we do.  And now we've got to kind of say hi to Philadelphia.  Sure.  We're kind of just giving them a taste as we go to commercials of some of the things we've done.  That's all.  Is this not right?  No, no.  We've got to feel this out as we go along.  See why he's pissed?  Oh, one thing.  I understand this.  Hold on.  Sure. 
[01:20:30]  It's like, all right, you're with your chick.  You're banging.  You're doing good.  You're feeling good.  You're doing your moves on her.  You know, those special moves.  And then all of a sudden you get a new chick and you start doing those moves.  And the old chick knows.  She pictures you doing those moves with the new girl.  And that's upsetting you, isn't it?  You bitch.  The nail on the head.  You little bitch.  You've got to understand.  My wife's birthday is June 12th.  I met you over at the Book Cherry concert because of what happened with the 90th radio station. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, Book Cherry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any chance if I slap on wow stickers, like I still have, on every single band in the  middle of the park garage or garage where I work that I can score two Aerosmith tickets  per lead?  Okay.  Terrific.  No chance whatsoever.  There we go.  You both suck.  All right.  Thanks, Alex.  Now we're talking.  Okay.  Let's go to Rich.  Did we give out the phone number?  Well, we haven't given out the phone in a while?  No.  Maybe we're a little.  All right.  Well, New York knows the phone number for Philadelphia, 692-1027, okay? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Rich, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I just want to tell the guys in Philly that they better stop not to encourage you because  they're only making it worse for themselves later on.  See?  It's true.  We do have a way of punishing our listeners.  I know that doesn't make any sense, but yeah, you're right.  It's a hard show to get to know in a couple hours.  You know, you've got to kind of sink into it.  It'll happen.  It latches on like herpes and doesn't go away. 
[01:22:00]  Like it or leave it.  You guys, the names are going to be out there anyway, so.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  You got it.  Okay.  We've got to move on to John.  John, what's going on, John?  Hey, John.  Yeah.  Hey.  I just want to tell you guys not to worry.  People in Philly, here's a little explanation of the L&A show.  It's kind of like when you get vaccinated for the, like, measles.  You get real sick for the vaccination, but after that, you're cool.  You're not going to get sick no more. 
[01:22:30]  Just hold on, guys.  You'll make it.  I feel the love.  Thank you, John.  Yeah, no problem.  You guys suck.  Man, we've been at this with our New York listeners for three years.  I thought they would represent us a little better than this today.  Yeah.  We won't make you sick after the shot.  It's got some analogy going on.  Jenny, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, Jenny.  I'm calling from Pennsylvania, but not from Philly.  Okay.  But I do have three words for Philadelphia listeners.  Teen, lesbian, sex. 
[01:23:00]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, we've got to start off slow, Jenny.  Yeah, well, you know, if they can't relate to that, maybe you should get Marco back on  the phone.  Yeah, we've got to break in management at WYSP.  You know, we've got to go into this slowly.  We break out the lesbian couch.  When have you guys ever done anything slowly before?  And the teen voyeur bus and all that, you know, they're going to have heart attacks down  there.  We've noticed something on this show.  You put teen in front of just about anything, just about, it makes it more better.  It always does.  More betterer. 
[01:23:30]  All right, Jenny, thank you.  Thanks a lot.  We've embraced that concept.  We should give out our unofficial website.  It's free.  We give it all away.  Foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  There's tons of stuff that we've done.  Yeah.  Just so, like, after we're off the air today, you can kind of sit back and try to  figure it all out on your own, okay?  Yeah, you could hunt through that and check out some of the sound clips and stuff we've  done over the years, and it might give you a better idea of what we do.  We have a message board that can only handle 20 people at a time, so why don't we give 
[01:24:00]  that out so that could crash?  OpieAnthony.com.  Oh, boy, they're going to have their hands full.  And Wackbag.com, another message board.  All right?  Woo!  Leah, what's going on?  It's going to be a long one.  Hey, Leah.  Yes?  What's up, Leah?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  I am so excited that you guys are in Pennsylvania.  I live in the Poconos, and I drive from Jersey every day up to the Poconos for two hours,  and I lose you. 
[01:24:30]  Okay.  And I am so happy that now I can finally listen to an entire show.  Well, thanks, Leah.  Great.  This is awesome.  More people that live in New York.  Well, thank you.  This is great.  They don't know what they're missing yet.  Wait till they hear you for a while.  All right, Leah.  Thank you.  Take care.  Yeah, we want to just get into the show, but it's hard with the phones being tied up  with people from New York saying, don't worry about it, you'll love it, and the Philly  people hating us.  Jim Norton in shock over here.  Stephen Lynch is coming by to do some songs. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  We have Steve Richards from the WWF calling in.  Yeah.  Thank God it's a call in.  I'd be afraid if he was here after the choking incident.  My throat is still effed up from that.  Really?  No joke.  Did you hear about this, Jim?  No.  Opie took all nine inches.  His throat's a little...  His throat's a little...  Dick.  Dick.  Dick.  No, we were in Boston a couple weeks ago for a big concert up there. 
[01:25:30]  The River Rave.  Like, 20, 30 bands.  And the WWF people were there.  And they're like, guys, we want to, you know, because we're in pretty good with those guys.  They're like, hey, we're taping something for Superstars or one of those programs.  Yeah.  This never aired, by the way.  Of course not.  It's evidence now.  This will be evidence.  Valuable evidence.  So, yeah, Steve Richards is there, and he's messing with us.  And we're supposed to get in his face and get the confrontation going.  Yeah.  Fake confrontation, because we're talking about wrestling.  He whispers to me before we start. 
[01:26:00]  He goes, Opie, I'm going to choke you, but don't worry about it.  It's going to be cool.  I'm not going to hurt you.  That old gag.  So we're just going at it with him, you know, making fun of him and stuff.  He turns, and he proceeds to start choking me.  He lifted him off the ground.  He had him by the back of the neck with one hand and right on his throat with his big,  needy wrestler hand and picked him up off the ground and squeezed really, really hard.  For another wrestler, I'm sure that's, you know, no big deal.  But for Opie, his face turned completely beet red, and he was almost choked out, like a second away. 
[01:26:30]  No joke.  He was choked out.  I was off the ground, and everyone around me, you know, because there was a ton of people backstage and stuff,  they were all laughing because they think it's really, really funny.  And I'm the only one going, oh, my God, I can't breathe, and everyone is just laughing, thinking it's, you know, one big gag.  Now, at this point, Anthony jumps on his back to continue the, you know, the thing we're doing with the guy.  Like, I'm going to do anything.  Right, right.  That's funny.  So he goes, when Anthony jumped on his back, he kind of panicked and started squeezing harder. 
[01:27:00]  It made it worse.  That's good.  I thought I was helping.  My face was turning beet red.  I guess the actual choking is on a bunch of websites out there.  I could have hit him with a bat.  I'm sure.  He wouldn't have stopped.  Cowbell Bill, what?  And, you know, originally I thought, okay, a little gag here, but when I saw your glasses like half cocked  and your face was all beet red, you weren't breathing.  I was like, for real here.  Yeah, I only go 165 pounds.  That's why I had something to your rescue.  Yeah, I jumped on his back. 
[01:27:30]  And then, yeah, so then he drops me.  I just fall down, thanking God I could breathe again.  And then he flicked Anthony off his back, like that.  And then I got on his face, like, what the F?  He goes, oh, man, I'm so sorry.  I lost control there.  Oh, are you all right?  You all right?  I just think it's funny that he panicked when you jumped on his back, like Lenny from Mice and Men.  He just killed Carter.  I just wanted to pet Opie's hair.  And here's what a big pussy we are.  And Opie's being a pussy this time.  He goes, okay, Steve Richards wants to be on the show. 
[01:28:00]  Like, okay, we can confront him about the choking incident.  And Rick goes, you want him on live in the studio or on the phone?  Opie goes, on the phone.  That way I can get a little tough with him.  On the phone.  Yeah, that's the truth.  Who is he?  Parrish the thought he's in here.  Who is he?  He's like some guy from the WWF.  Yeah.  His whole bit, his whole, like, the right to censor.  Right to censor thing is one of his characters.  He's in this group called the right to censor.  So he's like, I don't like women being exploited for sexual means.  And we're, like, calling him a faggy. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, faggy.  Oh, that's his, like, his wrestling.  His stick.  Right.  And then the cameras stop and he's like, look at the T's on her.  And, you know, it's all a gag.  But I'm sure to another wrestler, like I said, it was nothing.  But to Opie, you know, we're a couple of pencil necks.  So he'll be calling us soon.  We haven't talked to him since.  And all he's been doing is bitching about his throat.  Oh, it's been two and a half weeks.  It's not getting better.  No, it's not getting better.  The windpipe was crushed or something.  Crust windpipe.  I'm not kidding.  You crushed your trachea. 
[01:29:00]  I'm not kidding.  Also on the way, we got the retarded Laverne and Shirley coming in.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, Philly.  I apologize ahead of time.  Man, it's a treat.  Starting off with a bang, Black Earl and Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah, I know.  And Gay Marco throwing in there for a good measure.  Yes.  Joey Paisano in the studio.  Hey.  Wearing his Eagles jersey.  No, Philly.  And this is the truth.  Yeah, he's not faking it.  Yeah.  Big fan.  Joey has a restaurant in Little Italy here in New York that we love.  And he came in to support us, Joey.  And he is an Eagles fan, for real. 
[01:29:30]  I was going to bring you guys some gifts, you know, to congratulate you on, you know,  this whole thing and everything.  But I thought, with $30 million, how could I possibly come up with something?  What do you get a guy making $30 million?  That's funny.  Oh, we are so not making that money.  It's been reports in the paper saying that we were making $30 million.  And all I thought was, wow, Opie got a really good deal. 
[01:30:00]  You went behind my back and just got this fantastic deal, because I know I didn't get half of $30 million.  That's for sure.  I think they put the decimal in the wrong place.  I'm Anthony Cliff from Philly.  Hey, how unfortunate that Opie wasn't killed in that incident.  Uh, yeah, Steve.  Volus checking in.  Says, Stephen Richards, all of a sudden very popular in Philly.  Wow. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  I thought you'd feel my pain today.  No.  You like the Allen Iverson jersey?  Yeah, Joey.  Oh, very nice.  Such a bandwagon jumping.  Very nice.  Oh.  I took my Philly shirt off.  Yeah?  I took it off.  I'm not wearing any until I start feeling some love.  You're not feeling the love?  I mean, I could read more of this stuff if you'd like.  No.  What?  I'm not feeling love.  It's okay.  I know the love will come.  John from Philly.  Yeah.  I turned off the radio about an hour ago because you sucked. 
[01:31:00]  I just wanted to remind you.  That's good.  That's good.  You know what?  We got that guy.  He's so obsessed that he's going to have to listen tomorrow to see if he still sucked.  The fact that he went back into his computer after an hour just to read something.  Just all riled up.  You could see him.  I'm so pissed.  I got to write again.  They suck.  Humming classic rock while he's typing.  Some Jethro Tull or something.  Yeah.  Big D from Philly.  I'd rather give birth to a flaming porcupine than listen to the idiotic ramblings of you 
[01:31:30]  A-raping homos.  All right.  Thank you.  We're getting there.  Hey, Paul.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Real well.  Listen, I know you guys only because friends up there told me to check you guys out on Napster.  Oh, cool.  So, I mean, the stuff on Napster is sick.  And the funniest thing I've ever heard, I think, out of all this stuff, and a lot of it is great,  is that Regis wants minorities thing that you guys did. 
[01:32:00]  So, you've got to play that.  But can I give one criticism?  Yeah.  Yes.  If you don't mind?  I mean, I'm telling you, I love this stuff.  But there's this one, you've got this one guy that you have on, this guy, Old Dirty.  Mm-hmm.  Dumb spick, keep him off the radio.  Okay?  That guy should not be on the radio.  He should be out, like, cutting my lawn.  He gives us street cred.  He gives us some of the street cred in the hood, Old Dirty.  Please.  You guys are great, but keep that dumb spick off the radio. 
[01:32:30]  I don't think we need racial epithets being run out.  Oh, my God.  Did you say it to my face?  Are you in front of me, though?  O.D.  Hey, O.D.  He just hung up.  O.D.  Yeah.  You want to say hi to Philly?  Old Dirty.  Philadelphia, kid.  You know what I'm talking about?  The bell.  It's all good Philly cheesesteaks.  I'm on my way to Philly, kid.  I'm already there.  You're digging it?  You're feeling it?  Oh, hell yeah.  Look at the sixes, my man.  Yeah.  He's one.  Got it going on out there in Philly, bud.  This is Old Dirty. 
[01:33:00]  He gives us the street cred.  I swear to God.  He's total.  This is the real deal.  Yeah, Old Dirty has taught us a lot about the street lingo.  How many times have you been incarcerated?  Uh, well, Central Booking Nights, total like five or six.  Right.  But then hard, like, you know, you got to sit a while.  Yeah.  Twice.  Twice, yeah.  You're in it.  You're a player.  Old Dirty, we doing all right so far?  Huh?  We doing all right so far?  Were you listening in your hoopty on the way over here?  I took the train, bro. 
[01:33:30]  Took the train?  What do they call the train?  The train?  The iron horse.  That's a rough ride, bro.  I need to get my hood lingo on.  I'd love to know how he managed to steal a train.  Old Dirty, it didn't take him long to find the beer, either.  Nah.  It's like, that's the first thing I asked when I'm walking through the door.  My man, what's up?  You want a beer?  I'm like...  It's so funny, because you'll learn Anthony and I are as white as they come.  We're pathetic.  Yeah.  And Old Dirty helps us so we can be cool around the street. 
[01:34:00]  And he taught me the word cheddar.  It's cheddar.  Not cheddar.  Excuse me, do you have some cheddar?  Cheddar.  Cheddar.  Right.  Say it like you're feeling it.  So I had to tip one of the guys downstairs, and I didn't have any money,  and Anthony and I were driving in together, and we were, you know, getting in our car.  So I turned to Anthony in front of one of the brothers,  and I asked Anthony for some cheddar.  And he started laughing at you.  Uncontrollably.  I hope he thought he was laughing. 
[01:34:30]  I hope he thought he was, like, laughing because it was cool or something.  No, he was so laughing at you.  Yeah, I know.  Pathetic.  I tried, though.  And he probably lied to you.  Cheddar probably means, like, can I have a black baby to his mother.  Jim Morton, very angry.  Yo, that caller was from Philly, though?  Yeah, he didn't like you.  Oh, man, I'm getting no love already.  He's not in that kind of way, right?  Join the club, man.  No, people are loving the show so far in Philly.  You liking it out there?  It's a city of brotherly love.  I'm feeling the love.  John, what's going on? 
[01:35:00]  Hey, how's it going, boys?  All right.  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, I'm a longtime listener from up north Jersey.  Moved down here?  Yeah.  I'm driving down South Street in Philly in front of Fat Tuesday.  Some blonde chick gives me a wow.  Oh, nice.  See?  I guess you are accepted down here.  All right, cool.  Yeah, we'll talk about Whip Him Out Wednesday, you know, on Wednesday, obviously.  No problem, boys.  Thanks, John.  I don't believe it.  All right.  We should give out a prize.  I know.  Making Sandy Canes in.  Jake from Philadelphia. 
[01:35:30]  Get that third-rate comedian Jim Norton off the air.  Uh-oh.  Now you've done it.  I just want you to be in the loop, Jim.  Thank you very much.  At least you're third-rate.  Play some 80s mullethead butt rock.  I can't get enough of that garbage.  We have to surround ourselves with our cronies today to feel love.  No, they're just coming in.  Coming out of the woodwork.  Keith, the cop is here.  Yeah.  The guy that gets us out of trouble when we get tickets.  Handing out the PBA cards like it's just a deck of playing cards. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, Keith.  Keith.  What's going on?  How are we doing so far?  So far so good.  So far so good.  I'm not, you know, criminals next to me, but...  I know.  Today we're at peace.  Tomorrow we'll be at war.  But today we're great, my brother.  Don't worry.  Look at that.  See?  I've been along today.  When the felon and the cop can come together as one, we can truly find the love.  It's all good.  All right, Keith.  Exactly.  What do you know about the Philly PD there, Keith?  Not too much.  No?  NYPD and the Philly cops don't trade any trade secrets? 
[01:36:30]  No, not yet.  No?  It can't be any much different than New York, though.  What's the matter, old dirty?  Oh, all right.  You ever get into trouble in Philly?  I've checked the same B-thousand and corruption and all that.  You ever get arrested in Philly, okay?  Oh, no, no.  I've never been arrested out of state lines, Keith.  Not yet.  Not yet.  We're hoping.  We've been in New York, bro.  We're hoping.  Some of your cops in New York cops have the same rule.  Bust blacks.  How do you feel about that, O.J.? 
[01:37:00]  It's a little rough, man.  That's no end's opinion.  Everybody's entitled to this.  They're just trying to keep the peace, right?  Yeah, no doubt.  You're all right with that, right?  Yes.  You know, committing felonious assault, they got to get busted if they get caught, right?  The only thing I remember about Philly cops is the time they blew up that building that  MOVE was in.  There was some black organization MOVE, and they were held up in some place, and instead  of waiting them out or something like that, they blew the whole building up. 
[01:37:30]  It was classic.  But NYPD never did that.  The cops was in play.  They said, yo, we're blowing them out.  Just the TNT, dog.  Boom.  Very good.  Any more love coming in, O.P.?  I see you thumbing through the instant feedback.  Well, Rob from Philly writes, you guys blow like a cheap hooker.  At least we're getting some things.  It's not just you blow.  Like they have to come up with something creative.  Play some freaking music and shut the hell up.  I'd rather listen to Mutombo talk.  How did you lame asses ever get a job on the radio? 
[01:38:00]  Shh, don't ruin it.  You must be too ugly for TV.  Have a nice day.  All right.  I guess our XFL pregame never aired in Philly yet.  Well, we could tell the Philly audience it was a very popular TV show here in New York.  It lasted in the tens of hours.  Not even.  Tens of hours.  Not even.  Oh, boy.  Well, why they syndicate in Midwest, man?  Why do you go down to, like, Florida or something? 
[01:38:30]  We're working on it.  You know, you got, like, it's like getting a new smelly.  You got an arm on his face.  Hey, old Dirty, we got one for you.  This is from an angry nigga.  Oh, what?  But don't say it like that.  His name is Angry Nigga.  No, it's N-I-G-G-A.  Yeah.  That's okay, right?  Right?  All right.  Tell that dirty carjacking spick bastard I will bust his head open if he ever comes down my block.  Iverson rules.  They're violent in Philly, bro. 
[01:39:00]  What's the matter?  They're speaking violence.  I don't think I'm going to go through Pennsylvania any time soon, kid.  I'm going to have to go around.  Hey, would you?  Pennsylvania's awful.  Oh, jeez, Norton.  We're trying to win over an audience here.  Enough of being nice to these people.  Enough already.  Thanks for listening.  Just die and turn it off if you don't like it.  You live in Camden with a bell.  I'm sick and tired.  Wow.  Yeah.  Norton, we're working.  We're trying to win the hearts and minds of an audience. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Thanks, Rod.  I'll see it now.  Norton's disgusted.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Wow.  The feedback's coming in like crazy.  We can't even keep up.  It's like that?  Yeah.  That's silly, right?  We've got something from the O&A archives.  Which one is this, Rick?  It's 100 grand.  Oh, the 100 grand.  Nice.  And Brother Joe, new song.  Brother Joe, yeah.  With a brand new song.  What's your song today, Brother Joe?  I have a Barbara and Jenna Bush song for you.  It's topical.  It's topical. 
[01:40:00]  Oh!  It took two hours, but we're finally getting the show together.  Yeah.  Kind of.  And Steve Malich is outside with a couple new songs as well.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  See, nice.  You want to set up the 100 grand?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, what was this, Boston?  Yeah.  We were giving away 100 grand.  We used to work in Boston.  On the air.  And obviously, it wasn't money.  It's kind of goofy.  We were giving away 100 grand, but it turns out to be a candy bar.  And this guy was really pissed because he thought it was cold hard cash. 
[01:40:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Wolfram.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  No!  No way!  No way!  No way!  I won!  I won!  Oh, no way!  You did, right?  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I'm going to do with that?  What are you going to do with the 100 grand?  Oh, man.  The first thing, I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jeez.  I've got to come... 
[01:41:00]  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I...  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this...  Oh, man.  I got this shitbox for a truck.  I've got to get a no-one.  A new truck.  Oh, that's...  Oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just...  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you...  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey!  What the f*** you've been...  I've been listening to... 
[01:41:30]  I've been listening to f***ing radio...  For like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's the candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of two-states!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man!  Uh-oh.  He was dead.  I'm sorry.  We'll be...  We'll be...  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW is... 
[01:42:00]  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time...  On a very special...  Ron and Fez!  Time is out.  Hang in there, Fez.  I'm not going to make it, Ron.  You're going to make it.  Help is on the way.  It's delayed.  Just hold on.  See?  I told you.  The pizza's here.  Need extra cheese now.  All on the next Ron and Fez. 
[01:42:30]  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3, 1027.  WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027.  WNEW.  Hour.  Doctor!  Doctor!  All right, that's all you get.  See, but isn't that the part of the song you wait for?  Like you're in your car, you just want the master of puppets part.  A little taste.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:43:00]  Hello, Philly.  Jim Norton, the studio, and the rest of the gang, Anthony.  And believe me, we're not going to be acknowledging all the other markets like we are Philly today.  This is an extra special treat.  Can you please read that one in some feedback, that awful one for me?  Please read that.  Jim from Philadelphia, that one?  Yes.  Jim says, you guys are great, but I'd rather eat Mongolian afterbirth than listen to Norton.  He's about as funny as crib death. 
[01:43:30]  Is that beautiful?  Wow.  Norton, that sounds like you.  I know, crib death, always funny.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Always funny.  Jesus Christ.  And it's not just the whole shaking.  Wake up, baby.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Should we, uh...  You don't know, Jim survived, Sid.  Maybe we should ring the inappropriate bell and...  See, now it's okay, see?  Now everything's okay. 
[01:44:00]  That's all right now.  That's all you got to do to get out of trouble.  Whether it's a tasteless joke about babies or women or ethnic groups, as long as you ring the inappropriate bell, everything's fine and dandy.  It's all good.  Pedro.  You know, what's going on?  What's up?  Yeah, hold on.  Let me touch the toilet real quick.  I just finished using a bath for my afternoon crap.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's going on?  Yeah, all the Puerto Rican's in Canada, we love you guys, man.  Oh, yeah?  You're not funny as hell.  You're not funny.  I just got one problem with your show, though.  Yeah.  Who picks up your phone? 
[01:44:30]  That douchebag gets on my nerves.  That would be stinky.  That's too many questions.  That's stinky.  Too many questions.  Well, what did he ask you?  He asked me, who's this?  Where do you know us from?  Is your first time listening?  I called it four times.  You cut me off.  My first time getting through, I just come to praise all guys.  What's your credit card number?  What's your social security?  What's your address?  You got to ask me, was I still a virgin?  Do I take it in an anal?  All kinds of stuff.  Things are over me, you know.  Thank you.  You got to be nice to the new listeners.  Hell, yeah.  I'm not a new listener.  I listen to a new listener.  I call my friends at work. 
[01:45:00]  You know, this guy has too many questions.  Thank you.  He wants my penis eyes, too?  Yeah.  This is exactly why.  You know what I'm saying?  This is ridiculous.  Thank you.  Are you doing okay?  A lot of phone calls coming in today, right?  Thank you, Pejo.  Oh, absolutely.  We love you guys, man.  Keep it up, y'all.  On the real.  All right.  On the real.  On the real.  That was O.D. calling in from the other room.  Yeah, there you go.  You don't see him in the room enough.  Stinky, you all right?  A lot more phone calls coming in today.  How are you holding up?  But everyone else, everyone from New York is like, yeah, I listened to the guys the first  time, and so I have to ask them what station, YSP, what numbers? 
[01:45:30]  Click.  You know, so that's why I was asking him all the questions to make sure he was...  Ah, what station?  What number, man?  I'm sorry.  See, you don't even know what the frequency is, so I'm not even going to try to entertain  your call, sir.  You're a regular effing Columbo.  Look at you figuring it out.  Thank you.  We've got to say hi to Stevie Richards from the WWF.  Uh-oh.  Stevie.  Stevie.  How are you, Anthony?  Stevie, very well.  I'm going to ask Anthony how he is, because if I ask Opie, he's going to cry like a little 
[01:46:00]  bitch like he's been doing for the past week.  But I'll ask you anyway.  How are you doing, Opie?  Stevie, a lot of people are going to start thinking this is like an Andy Kaufman bit or  something.  No, no, no.  You have promoted it as an Andy Kaufman bit.  You have latched that poor man's name to the ground by actually associating yourself  or thinking you're on the same level as him.  You choked me unconscious.  Oh, he was close.  He was close, Steve.  Well, you know what?  If you didn't jump on my back, Anthony, maybe I wouldn't have to clamp down on him. 
[01:46:30]  Did you or did you not run up to me after it was over and go, oh, my God, I'm sorry,  I'm sorry.  Are you okay?  Yeah, if you're okay.  It's been two and a half weeks.  I'm still not okay.  Oh, God.  I think you're okay.  You signed a $30 million radio deal.  I think you're doing okay.  $30 million.  We did not sign a $30 million deal.  You know what?  Oh, I'm sorry.  You only signed one third of that.  No.  It was like $10 million.  Go on welfare.  It was not even close to that, Stevie. 
[01:47:00]  Stevie, you've got to understand.  I know that would probably be a normal move with a wrestler, but with Opie, you know,  your whole hand fit around his neck.  Yeah, you're what, 230?  Actually, his girlfriend told me to do it, though.  You're what, 230 pounds?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm 230.  I'm like 165, 170.  It don't matter.  I don't know.  Hey, you guys are enjoying that video clip on your website.  Pound for pound, you're just as big as me.  I think it's what, StevieRichards.com?  Yeah.  Yeah, people downloading the clip and just laughing their ass. 
[01:47:30]  You know what?  Actually, Opie, I've got to say this.  I go, you guys know I was born and raised in Philadelphia.  Yeah, well...  If I knew, I knew you were going to have a date tonight.  Yeah.  If I knew the show was going to be this bad, I would choke you harder.  Another positive call from Philly.  The show would only be half as bad if you couldn't talk.  Everyone in Philly right now just clapping, yes, loving Stevie Riches.  You don't even know the world of crap you stepped into by going to Philadelphia.  Those people are never happy with anything.  Don't you understand that?  They had the best wrestler in the world living there for 29 years. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Who, Hulk Hogan?  Yeah, yeah, Hulk Hogan.  Yeah, she lived right down there on Kensington Avenue.  Right under the L, right next to Rocky's old gym that he used to work out with Mickey.  There you have it.  Now, what's going on, Stevie?  Nothing like that.  I actually called you guys to see what's going on with you guys.  I mean, no...  Well, we're in Philly now.  Yeah, I said it like Philly.  Used guys.  Used guys.  And you, what are you doing in the WWF now?  What's your storyline?  Well, you know, I'm sitting back...  Don't even try to feed the whole plot line that you don't like looking at women's cans. 
[01:48:30]  No, no.  I was just going to tell you, I spend the whole time up in the luxury boxes every TV playing video games.  My new job assignment for the past month.  Oh, is it?  Well, I...  You come off like kind of a faggy guy.  What's that?  Your character comes off like a faggy guy.  You're not coming off like it's morality.  You're coming off like you don't enjoy women.  Anthony, don't piss him off again.  He can't choke me through the phone.  Pussy.  That's why that girl kept showing me her breasts like every three seconds. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, and you were disgusted.  Yeah, that's right, pussy boy.  That's why you choked me hard.  Of course I was disgusted.  Oh, my girl would have killed her if she was there.  Your girl would have killed me.  Is that what you call him?  What's that?  Is that what you call him, your girl?  Oh, not like you.  It was on my back.  Get off my partner.  Get off him.  You looked very open to anal.  Right?  You looked very open to anal sex.  You were very open to jumping on my back.  You look behind me.  I ain't going to be the one getting it.  What's that?  I ain't going to be the one getting it. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, so you'd rather be giving it to another guy.  Looks like you were used to having guys on your back.  Really?  Well, I've been carrying a bunch of guys ever, you know, since ECW days.  Doesn't surprise me.  Used to carry and crash high everywhere every time we wrestle.  Sigh.  Anthony, you're so brave.  He's on the phone.  Over the phone, I know.  It's really funny.  It's really funny.  It's always you bringing up the gay thing.  It's always you saying about the homosexual thing.  That's right, Stevie.  That's right.  The name like Stevie.  Why not Steven?  Stevie is like. 
[01:50:00]  Everybody still calls me Stevie.  If you want to call me Michael, that's my real name.  Hey, Faye, brother.  Hey, Stevie, I'm a big fan of yours, okay?  Yes.  Yes, I am.  Next time you can choke his chicken.  I don't know if he wasn't a big fan of mine because we could have used a weight advantage.  Yeah.  When are you coming in to see us?  Whenever you guys want.  If you guys want me to come in and see you, that's more than fine.  I heard you're going to have armored security there and everybody like that.  Oh, no, no, no.  I think we need it.  Armored security?  Wow, that's pretty heavy, actually.  I meant armed security.  Hey, was our acting that bad that they didn't want to run the pace on WWF? 
[01:50:30]  I think all three of us were pretty bad.  Really?  The only acting that wasn't going on was when I was going to choke that.  I was standing there going, yeah, censoring good.  Censoring good.  Yeah, stop that.  Please.  I was about eight hours into my Sam Adams fest.  Yeah, over 60,000 people bought my act.  Right.  They didn't like the fact I was shutting the show down.  All right.  Well, Stevie, we've got to move on.  Oh, yeah.  You put me on hold longer and I was on the show. 
[01:51:00]  No, that's not true.  Well, when are you guys going to actually have me on the show in person at the studio and  hand me a nice check after I'm done?  Would you like to come in tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yes, I will come into the show tomorrow.  All right.  We'll do a little face-to-face thing.  And then let's see Opie call him a fag and a pussy then.  Are you going to drive up and get me and then pick me up and bring me back to the studio?  No.  I'm not driving to New York City.  Who do you think you are, Triple H?  What then?  Who do you think you are, Triple H?  We get you a limo and enough?  You're saying that I'm some sort of scrub that doesn't deserve to be picked up. 
[01:51:30]  I didn't say a scrub.  Sorry about that Ted Turner thing there.  You know, you're not the rock.  Hey, Stevie, where are you?  I'm in Stanford.  Do we have to get you from Stanford?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like across the country.  It's only like 30 minutes away.  Don't you drive?  Well, I guess a phone call is good enough then.  You cheap bastard.  That's what I got.  Both of you.  All right.  Is that how you got so rich by being so cheap?  It's a selfie. 
[01:52:00]  Unbelievable.  Easy.  Stevie, no, we got to, because Brother Joe is here with a Bush song we got to play.  That is very acceptable.  That's fine.  You will have your producer call me.  I'll call him tomorrow and we'll make the arrangement.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Okay, please, come on.  What?  Do yourself a favor.  Just get the hell out of Philadelphia before you're ruined.  These people are going to stick it up your ass, I swear to God.  If anyone knows what that's like.  That's why all the sports teams are leaving.  That's why I left.  I was going to run for mayor.  Now I'm running for mayor while I'm for Connecticut. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  No, we'll get along just fine with Philly.  Okay.  Stevie, come in and see us.  I will.  All right, there he goes.  All right.  Thank you.  Stevie Richards from the WWF.  You have one more question for him, Opey?  Can we see your stuff?  Easy.  Can we see your stuff?  Anthony, Brother Joe is in the studio?  Yes.  To help with this mess, we call the Opey and Anthony Show.  Right.  And he's got a new little ditty for everybody.  It's a little something about Barbara and Jenna Bush.  We've been reading about them in the paper the past couple of weeks. 
[01:53:00]  The Bush gals rule.  Yes.  You know, I have been reading about the Bush girls in the paper.  Matter of fact, I've been reading Anthony's quotes about the Bush girls in the paper today.  Opey, the quote count, we like doing quote counts in the newspapers.  Opey, Opey's still ahead, but today, USA Today, an Anthony quote.  Nice.  There you go.  Yeah, you were in the USA Today.  He's talking about the Bush girls.  And they asked me for a quote.  This is the latest, by the way, on this.  The National Enquirer is planning to run quotes from a college student alleging that he smoked pot with both Bush daughters. 
[01:53:30]  Ooh.  College girls that like going out drinking, smoking pot?  No.  Oh, go on.  Stop.  They're college girls.  You ever see, I saw them in the background of the College Girls Go Wild videotape at night.  The Bush girls at Mardi Gras.  Beads falling on their heads, their teeth flapping in the breeze.  I'm really glad my father is not president.  Oh.  President's son likes to hide toilet paper. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, we'll get into the Norton stories eventually.  Norton's a sick.  All right, let's check out the song from Brother Joe.  All right.  We also have Stephen Lynch standing by with a couple of new songs as well.  Yeah.  This is, yeah, see, we play music on our show.  I want to know what Philly thinks about this one, too.  I definitely want to hear that.  Everything will suck.  Everything will suck for a couple of weeks.  It's the way it is.  If we get a chuckle out of it, we're ahead of the game now.  You want to go for a chuckle, see if they chuckle? 
[01:54:30]  See if they chuckle.  All right, we'll see if they chuckle.  It's Brother Joe, a little song about the Bush daughters.  All right.  Here's Baru likes a social drink.  Citrus, champagne, white or pink.  The jazz will enter the dinosaur until she's out of the blind.  Blow you for a drink.  There are the Bushes.  First family luscious all the way.  Underage future Alkyans. 
[01:55:00]  Different as night and day.  While Bobber does cocktails after eight.  And six red wines or Chardonnay.  Janice would have a clear chase with a keg of beer.  Crunches, party snakes.  They're the Bushes.  First family luscious.  Flushes and you'll find.  They love a shot.  And when somebody comes to touch.  Daddy pays all their fines.  They're the Bushes. 
[01:55:30]  And they love getting light.  She was a hoo-er.  Yeah, that's a chuckle.  That's funny.  That's a good job, Joe.  Thank you.  A couple chuckles in there.  Thank you.  You think you could write something that doesn't go to the Patty Duke theme?  No.  No.  Come on, I'm kidding.  I don't know if we should play the other one.  Oh, no.  No, that was the Columbine one.  People are very sensitive these days.  We always play Schindler last time.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's not even funny.  It's moronic, jerk.  We haven't played the Schindler song in a while.  We haven't?  Has it been that long?  Yeah.  The happy Schindler song?  Joe, what was the inspiration for this song?  It was just putting a positive spin on the movie.  No positive spin.  Had to put a positive spin on it.  I saw the movie for the first time about a week before I wrote the song.  And you felt like it, yeah, you needed to write it down.  There were a thousand or so lucky people of the Jewish persuasion that, you know, that ended up making out in the war. 
[01:56:30]  So that's why it has a happy, peppy feel.  That's right.  A true optimist.  Six million negatives don't make a positive.  Jesus.  All right.  Would you like to hear this one, Ann?  Sure.  It's a Brother Joe showcase.  Thank you.  His take on Schindler's List. 
[01:57:00]  Well, it's 1944, the right shot's pissed.  Poland's invaded by the Nazi blitz.  And although you're a Jew, yeah, you won't get this.  They got your name on Schindler's List.  Granny's gone, and so's your sis.  But wait, no reason to cut your wrist.  Yeah, you're gone on this, now you get the gist.  Got your name on Schindler's List.  You might have been sent to Auschwitz. 
[01:57:30]  That place is such a gasp.  And you could have caught a bullet in the crack out ghetto, but Schindler, we saved your ass.  Now you've got a job with a thousand other Jews.  You've met my finger, built a two.  You thought you were ghetto, but what a twist.  They found your name on Schindler's List.  Okay, terrific.  Now you see.  Good to sing!  Good to sing! 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, cute little ditty.  Thank you, Joe.  You know, you just have to stay happy.  Most people watch it and get extremely depressed.  Not Joe.  No.  That's a little coon about it.  He's an optimist.  Yeah, well, that's always good.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I've been in Philly now for about an hour and a half.  I'm a New York listener.  We took the old WOW stickers, you know, did some work on them on the computer, turned  them into YSP WOW stickers instead of the NEW ones. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  And we have about four cars here with some teen girls, and we were going down 95 around  Philly.  We're WOWing.  We got off 95, started driving down South Street in Philly.  People are throwing crap at us.  Not being well-received here.  And this is, these are teen girls.  Well, Rob, now you know how we feel today.  Well, I got some pictures and everything, so when we get them developed, I'll send them  in to you guys so you can see what we're putting up with.  All right, Rob.  Take care. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  We'll explain with them on Wednesday on Wednesday.  Yeah.  Why waste time on that today, right?  Right.  Let's go to Carl.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm a first-time listener from Elton, Maryland.  Wah, wah.  Maryland?  Yeah.  Nice.  It's surprising.  The station barely comes in down here, but yeah, I'm about 40 miles over to Delaware  Lawn.  Hey, how about that?  Man.  You robbed a house in Prince George's County, Maryland.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, Dirty, I thought you said you didn't do any crimes over the state line.  No, we was in a party. 
[01:59:30]  Y'all, what?  Fuckwiling?  Oh, we never got convicted or arrested.  I'm just waiting for old Dirty to start going bling bling.  He does the bling bling.  Yeah, Prince George's County.  So, Carl, what do you think so far?  Hey, the show ain't that bad, guys.  It's good to finally hear a talk show on this time of the day.  Normally, the only thing I got is the early morning stuff.  Right on.  And, I mean, if somebody compared you guys to Howard Stern, I'm telling you, it's a far cry from  it.  I can't stand Stern.  Nah, we'll explain all that in time.  Oh, okay.  There's more to it than that, huh?  Nah, we're all right.  Thanks, Carl. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, no problem, guys.  One big happy part of the Infinity family.  Of course.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, man, what's going on, boys?  How you doing?  Doing all right.  Good.  I had a lot of stinky to get on the air here, but I've actually listened to you guys in  North Jersey.  But I think for the Philly listeners, you should play a little of the Special Olympics.  Yeah, no, we'll get to a lot of that stuff.  Steve Lynch has some new songs we're going to play right after the break.  There you go.  There you go.  I just came to hear the hits.  What is he doing?  New stuff. 
[02:00:30]  Play Freebird, man.  Hey, Pat, what's up?  Hey, Pat?  What?  Is this Open Anthony?  Yeah, Pat from Philly.  What's up?  Hey, yeah, that's me.  What are you guys doing?  Not too bad of a show.  Well, we're starting off slow.  Yeah, it's not bad.  And that guy there, that comedian guy, he's not too bad either.  I just want to tell you guys a couple of things about Phil Dove that you might not know.  All right, go ahead.  We are the city's brotherly love.  Our number one...  We're feeling the love today.  Yeah, our number one attraction is Liberty Bell. 
[02:01:00]  I bet you didn't know about it.  About 45 minutes ago, the mayor died.  Oh, oh, oh.  That old gag.  No, that new gag.  That new gag.  Thank you, Pat.  That new gag.  Thank you.  That's another story we've got to tell one of these days.  We killed the mayor of Boston.  Jake from Philadelphia.  I thought this show couldn't get any worse.  Then I heard Jim Norton.  Then I heard Brother Joe.  Send them back to Star Search to work on their acts.  Nice.  Star Search.  And Brother Joe gets three and a half stars. 
[02:01:30]  Norton gets three and three quarter stars.  Three stars for Joel and Norton gets hepatitis.  Well, we're trying to pick out the positive ones, Anthony.  We're getting there.  That's close.  At least it wasn't us.  Ben, who we haven't even introduced yet.  Ben was all excited pouring to that one.  I'm like, oh, oh, oh.  Is that a good one?  It's good stuff.  Okay.  Stephen Lynch up next.  Is the retarded Laverne Shirley here?  Not yet, but they call me from the train. 
[02:02:00]  They're very close.  Jim, have you seen...  Tell them to throw themselves under it.  Have you seen Marion's new perm yet?  No, I've met them one time at WWF, so I actually don't know them.  Okay.  Hot.  Before you guys in Philadelphia turn off the radio forever, or this station forever,  stick around for the retarded Laverne Shirley, okay?  Yeah.  Something from the O&A archives.  Hi, Mom.  I'm in porn.  Oh, nice.  Porno.  Nice little game we like to play.  Mm-hmm.  Get daughters to call their moms to tell them that things, you know, haven't been going 
[02:02:30]  well, and that they got fired, and they had to make money, so they went into porn.  Mom's always heartbroken when they hear this.  They love this.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom, I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Now, where's your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny?  Yes.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny, and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi.  Can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay.  Hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yes?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart. 
[02:03:30]  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but I know I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  Why?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll...  You, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:00]  Holy Jesus, I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, I have like three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where, where can I call you?  The same number, but, Mom?  What? 
[02:04:30]  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that, you killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom. 
[02:05:00]  We're really...  Okay, I am going to kill you.  I'm waiting, Mom.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, we have a brand new sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, we do.  Hello, Philly.  It's Bud Light.  Bud Light.  If you want a light beer, I always go for a Bud Light.  Feel a little filled up?  If you want to drink beer but you don't want to feel full, Bud Light does the trick. 
[02:05:30]  That's right, Opie.  You know what I'm going to do after this show?  I'm going to take a big, Nicky 6-sized syringe of heroin and wash it down with a nice Bud Light.  Anthony.  Yes?  Who are you kidding?  You're drinking Bud Light right now.  Bud Light?  I know.  I was feeling a little full.  We had those cheesesteaks that the fine people from YSP brought us.  And I was full.  So what did I do?  I grabbed a Bud Light.  Great beer. 
[02:06:00]  That's right.  They have a new bottle, too.  It's a clear plastic label on the bottle.  It's easily recognizable.  So if you're hammered, you could still find it.  Just peel at it.  If you can't peel a label off, you're drinking a Bud Light.  We love it.  Bud Light.  Don't be fooled by imitations.  You only want the best.  So for the real taste that won't fill you up and never lets you down, make it a Bud Light.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[02:06:30]  What the hell were you thinking?  Yeah, what were you thinking, YSP?  You guys got to be insane.  Tim Sabian, the PD of YSP, has to be insane.  Should we get him on the line again, Anthony? 
[02:07:00]  See how things are going?  Probably should.  See if he's a beaten man yet.  At 3 o'clock, he was so excited.  Guys, your first show in Philadelphia.  We're all ecstatic.  We're kind of hanging out in my office waiting for the show to start.  I bet you everyone has left him alone now.  Left him to hit his bottle.  He turned into Dr. Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie.  But they were in New York.  It was good.  And then, but then I tuned in in Philly and people don't like, but then, and then Jeannie 
[02:07:30]  was, I saw a girl in the office and I came, Major Nelson, I, but, but then in New York  they did, but in Philly.  The confused Dr. Bellows.  The confused Tim Sabian, program director of WISP.  Major Nelson, they were loved in New York and I brought them to Philly, but then, and  now Philly says, Major Nelson.  Stephen Lynch is in the studio.  Stephen.  What's up? 
[02:08:00]  We haven't seen you in a while, man.  I know.  It's been a long time.  Very exciting day for us today.  You know that, right?  I'm excited to be here.  No, it's been a long time since he's been on the show.  We see him a lot.  Every bar we go to, doesn't matter where you are.  Here's to alcohol.  The cause of and solution to all life problems.  It doesn't matter what, like, club we go to.  It could be something that we kind of push on the radio if we're hanging out when my brother  Joe is playing somewhere.  I go to see brother Joe as often as I can. 
[02:08:30]  We always have a good time.  And then we go down, but it could be like we just decided to go out after the show and  we go to some club, like, blocks and blocks away from the studio, and we're drinking.  It's like, hey, Lynch is here.  It'll just show up where there's a shot.  All right.  It's got, like, we got a alcohol low jack on us and he just tracks us down.  Will you be able to play that guitar today, Stephen?  I think so.  All right.  I haven't had too many beers.  Wait, Phil from Philly has something for us, though, really fast.  Phil, what's up? 
[02:09:00]  Yo, what's up?  It's Paul, actually.  Hey, Paul.  Whoa, the F word.  The first F word.  Your effing lead-ins are so hilarious down here, man.  What do you mean?  There's, like, this one where it's like, hey, Philly, are you ready to rock with O and  A?  They're so bad.  Uh-oh.  You know, it's weird.  We kind of pay attention to the promos that they do for us here in New York.  And if there's something too goofy or wacky sounding, we go, what are you doing?  You know, kind of change.  You know, well, we've got to get those promos. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I think we missed a few, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, we have no idea what they're playing in Philadelphia.  Historia of Anthony!  Oh!  The one at the top of the show is great, though.  It's just fought, like, four times.  Oh, really?  It shows people exactly what they're in for.  Good.  Great.  And I wanted to recommend a little racist phone tag to get everybody together with each  other.  Well, Phil, actually, we've got to, like, cut you off, because Tim Sabian, the program director  of WISP, is on the line.  That's one, guys. 
[02:10:00]  Richard Nelson.  Why is Rick shaking his head?  He sounds like a beaten man, dude.  Does he?  It's not even three hours into it that he sounds just beaten to hell.  We should do a comparison here, Anthony.  He was so happy and jovial.  Yeah.  At three o'clock.  Now let's talk to the Tim Sabian at 553.  I hate these guys.  Will you ever play Ozzy Osbourne?  It just doesn't stop.  Well, you had to know that when you put us in place of music that people love, that you're 
[02:10:30]  going to get some flack.  Yeah.  Tim?  You know, it's funny for the first ten minutes.  Will you ever play Ozzy Osbourne?  Will you ever play Van Halen?  These guys suck.  It's a mantra.  Are you reading feedbacks or just telling us this?  No, I'm just off the top of my head now.  Is that just you talking about it?  I guess it's memorized.  The beaten Tim Sabian. 
[02:11:00]  What'd you think?  Are you the only one left in the studio now down there?  Yeah.  That's it.  Just me, the janitor.  Everyone's blood.  Man, you sound beaten.  This poor guy.  It's been a long day.  I got audio, Anthony, of Tim Sabian as he tries to get his job back after this.  Oh, really?  This train wreck.  Yes.  Would you like to hear it?  Let's hear.  Let's listen to Tim Sabian.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Is it that bad, Tim? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God.  It's really, it's weighing on you, isn't it?  Oh, wait.  We have Tim's boss on the phone.  Yeah?  Hello?  You're fired!  Wow, it is bad.  If one sound effect could sum up us in Philly, I think it's this. 
[02:12:00]  No?  What could help?  Birthday!  No.  Anthony, I have more audio of Tim Sabian's boss.  What are you people?  On dope?  Tim?  Yes.  Tim, comment.  Comment, Tim.  It hurts.  Uh-oh.  Tim's boss.  On the phone.  Gee, this guy doesn't give up. 
[02:12:30]  Your days of finger-banging, old Mary Jane's rotten crotch, through her pretty pink panties,  are over!  Hey, here's the new, uh, program director.  Never here, Smith is here.  Ah, you poor bastard.  Here's Tim trying to explain this whole mess to his, uh, his, his boss, Anthony.  I got, I got thought of a kind of brain.  Here's him trying to describe the show to his boss. 
[02:13:00]  It's gonna make you cute!  Tim's boss.  Go!  Ask yourself!  Is this kind of, um, what's going on?  Exactly.  Right to the T.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Tim.  Feel bad for him now.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.  I'll have two Jägermeisters, and I'll forget about everything.  All right.  Well, here's Tim's boss.  Man, you are one pathetic loser. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Tim, you're the only one not laughing.  Well, thanks for slowing up my life.  That's okay.  Tim's boss, Anthony.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it!  Fall around like a dog!  You see?  You see?  Your stupid minds!  Stupid!  Stupid! 
[02:14:00]  Stupid!  Tim, would you like to give out the address for the complaint letters that we'll be following?  Ah, very good.  I'll have a P.O. box and a 1-800 number.  All right.  Well, thank you, Tim.  All right.  Hang in there.  I gotta go back to packing.  Okay.  Ah!  There he goes.  The man responsible for this.  Just remember, I've got two kids and a mortgage.  And we understand.  Thank you, Tim.  All right, thanks.  The guy responsible for wrecking your radio station. 
[02:14:30]  That's so great.  How miserable does he sound?  He was so excited.  That's great.  He was so excited.  Do you have a listener on the line?  Yeah.  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  All right.  Let's go to Bill.  Hey, Bill, what's going on?  Well, when are you guys going to play some music?  All folks down here in Phipps.  Oh, Billy.  Well, listen.  Why don't we get Stephen Lynch to play a song, Anthony? 
[02:15:00]  That's good.  People bitching about not hearing music.  Is this the kind of music they want to hear?  We'll play some music.  Yeah.  Stephen, what do you got for us?  Billy, are you ready to rock and roll?  You wanted the best, so now you got the best.  What do you got today, Stephen?  Well, yeah, I got a little tune that I'm going to sing with my buddy Mark here.  Okay.  I wrote this because Mark and I have been friends for a really, really long time, and I think  what makes us such good friends is that we're complete opposites. 
[02:15:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's right.  We just, we like different.  Well, that makes us good friends, too, Rick.  Thank you for this.  Yeah, why is everyone doing the universal sign for BJ?  So we wanted to celebrate the fact that we like different things with a little song.  It goes something like this.  All right.  I like my toast buttered, and I take mine dry.  I dig the Beatles, I'm a Stones kind of guy. 
[02:16:00]  I have fine taste, and I like things cheap.  I want to stay up all night.  I just want to sleep with your sister.  What did you just say?  What?  You just said something.  No, I want to sleep.  All right, here we go.  You ready?  No, I'm not ready.  I love the sunshine, and I want to nail your sister.  No, you just said it again.  I like Julia Roberts movies. 
[02:16:30]  I just want to F the S out of your sister.  Hey, Mark, you would rule.  Hey, if you'd say it's cool, I'd go pick her up at a junior high school.  Oh, yeah, your sister, yeah.  I want to F your sister.  I want to F her in the A.  I don't know what you're saying.  C all over his chin.  Stop using love her.  I stick my fist in her feet.  I'm going to move it around, and then I'm moving to her A-hole.  It'd be so F'd be great. 
[02:17:00]  I'd nail it until I want to F your sister.  Stop it.  What?  I want to make one thing clear.  I do not like Julia Roberts movies.  Very nice.  Hey, look at that.  Hello, Philadelphia!  Look at that.  There's one thing I love to do.  It's try out new material in front of a hostile, hostile audience.  Isn't that good?  That was very good.  My heart is beating.  That was very good. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, right.  Wasn't that the bit that got the Smothers Brothers canceled years ago?  It was their own sister, you see?  Oh, my God.  And the great thing is you don't like Julia Roberts movies,  and you look like her boyfriend from Dying Young.  Very nice.  Jim Dorn.  You have a chemo bit back in.  That's nice.  You have another one, Steve Lynch?  Not really any new thing.  No, no.  If you want to...  Hey, John, you're the Billy. 
[02:18:00]  That's true.  I could play some of the old stuff.  Yeah, but why don't we...  I want to hear...  Which one do you want to hear?  Special Olympics.  I really do.  I love it.  I know Stephen...  You can create a whole new audience of Stephen.  Stephen has been involved with the Special Olympics for quite a while,  and I don't think they get the recognition they deserve.  Will this be such a fine charity?  Will this be the long version of the song or the short version?  Of course it is.  That's not long.  It's hysterical.  What should you prefer? 
[02:18:30]  Tim.  Tim, from WYSP, you might want to turn your radio off at this point.  He already has.  He's banged his head against it so many times, it's broken.  All right.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Watch them fall into the pool that's diving at the Special Olympics. 
[02:19:00]  Second verse. 
[02:19:30]  Special Olympics.  Kid with downs, wins the race, even though he stood in place.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Round his neck, gold medals hung, resting on his giant tongue. 
[02:20:00]  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  But I kid, when I sing, these games are a beautiful thing.  Okay, really, I'm just trying to avoid karma because I know my kids are going to be born crippled and semi-retarded and I'll have to spend all of my time at the Special Olympics. 
[02:20:30]  Olympics.  Olympics.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Stick around for a whole set on Cancer Kids.  Which is just hysterical.  You'll laugh your ass off.  Mickey.  You guys, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  What?  What happened?  I used to live up in New York, came down here, had nothing to listen to in the afternoon.  Oh, cool.  Which was literally, I had the kitchen knife to my chest.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  And then all of a sudden I went on to the sound of music.  Yeah.  Here you are.  All right, cool.  The knife is on the table.  Hey, all I got to say is...  Pass that knife to a new Philly listener so they could plunge it through their own chest.  Well, no, you don't understand.  I tried to explain Stephen Lynch's Special Olympics song to everyone.  No one got it until just now.  Oh, yeah, they got it now.  Now, the greatest thing is Precious is here and they sang a song about Anthony's girlfriend,  which is great right now.  All right.  Thank you, Mickey.  Underage songs. 
[02:21:30]  We've got to take another break.  Everyone knows I'm a pedo.  Anthony, another one from the ONA Archive?  Yes.  Just giving Philly a little taste today.  Yeah, you taste it.  Oh, we get the...  We get the stupid...  Dock it!  We get stupid radio contest whores.  Yeah.  They call our station thinking they got another station.  Yeah, prize pigs, we call them. 
[02:22:00]  They have redialed or automatic dialed, whatever that is,  in their phones and they got like a 10 stations program.  They just keep going contest to contest.  Sometimes they hit the wrong one.  That's what they did and they got us.  This lady was trying to win Donna Summer tickets and called the wrong station.  Hi, Annie W.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a 0.5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[02:22:30]  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  What do you say?  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, a bikini? 
[02:23:00]  A bikini.  I'm suntanning.  Suntanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  Do you like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas. 
[02:23:30]  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strenuous object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah.  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again.  Yeah.  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.

What's your favorite sexual position? 
[02:24:30]  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Did she hang up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.

[02:26:00]  New York.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Jim, thanks for helping us out today.  Pleasure.  Our first day of syndication as we spread the virus to Philadelphia today.  The plague.  The plague that is the Opie and Anthony show.  Stephen Lentz debuting a new song today.  That was nice.  It's almost like theater.  That song.  It was like theater.  I said, Stephen, I said that first song, the one you debuted today. 
[02:26:30]  Sister, I believe.  Yeah.  Like theater.  I like that.  It's radio, yet...  It's vaudeville, really.  You were acting.  Yeah, there was some good acting.  I have a top hat and a cane, but nobody can see it.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Yeah, I hope you guys got an ironclad contract with that Philadelphia station, or this will  be the shortest syndicated show on radio history. 
[02:27:00]  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  I'm starting to feel the love.  What happened?  I'm not feeling really good right now.  I've been listening for 45 minutes, and it's over.  Not one...  I'll tell you later.  45 minutes.  Scott, not one chuckle in 45 minutes.  We're just going...  I think it's hilarious.  He's laughing now.  We're just going for a couple chuckles.  That's all.  That's all.  Yeah, I think it's hilarious, but I'm not sure about those Philly people.  I don't know.  I don't...  I'll tell you later. 
[02:27:30]  I think Philly will be just fine, Anthony, right?  Right.  Oh.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  Listening down from Red Hill, PA.  Yeah.  Red Hill.  Yeah.  It's north of Philly.  I grew up there.  You did?  No, I grew up on Blue Hill.  Oh, cool.  Hey, Mark, what do you got?  I had blue balls once.  Loving the show, man.  These guys, that Stephen guy, he's a local up there?  He's been on Comedy Central, and he tours the colleges. 
[02:28:00]  Stephen, have you ever played the colleges down in Philly?  I played Beaver College.  Did you?  Yeah.  I played Beaver College.  Look at you.  That F, your sister's song was hysterical.  He's got tons of them.  Go on Napster.  There's a ton of them up there.  You should have seen the dance number that followed it.  Hey, wait.  Oh, I just messed up.  Stephen Lynch has a CD.  Oh, cool, cool.  I just wanted to make a suggestion, though.  Thank you, Sophie.  Yeah, go ahead, Mark.  I just wanted to make a suggestion that you have a lot of your local guys on there. 
[02:28:30]  Maybe get some Philly guys sometime up there, like comedians, bands, things like that.  Mark, we've just begun.  Trust me, it's going to get cool.  Yeah, get like, I don't know, there's got to do some Philly comics, but get local bands,  too, from Philly, like Wolfpack or Bloodhound Gang or something up there.  Yeah, we're going to work it out.  And you'll get all the Philly people to listen.  No, we're going to work it out.  Thanks, Mark.  Thanks, man.  You guys rule.  All right.  Now, Stephen, how can they get your CD?  They can go to my website, www.stephenlynch.com.  That's with a Ph.  Or you can get it on Amazon or CD now. 
[02:29:00]  Or Napster.  And they'll spell Lynch.  L-I-N-C-L-Y.  Hey, and I'm a local boy.  I was born in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.  Stop it.  If that means anything.  Were you?  Yeah, I was.  No, I swear to God.  I'm trying to sell two extra CDs.  Oh, well, I wasn't going to get it, but hell.  He was born here.  He's some local boy.  That's good.  Please.  I got a Hummer from a tranny in Philly. 
[02:29:30]  Gabriel, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, Lynch, that sounds great, man.  It's like some sick version of Bohemia arresting.  Oh, wow.  Well, thanks.  I appreciate it.  That's great, man.  All right, only without the gay oral from a guy with an overbite, right?  Just like it, though.  Are you guys ready for the retarded Laverne Shirley?  Hey, we got the retarded Laverne Shirley theme song.  These two, Jesus Christ.  They look like trolls, and one of them just got a new perm. 
[02:30:00]  And lost eight pounds.  Lost eight pounds.  Looking hot.  We'll let him in in a second.  But first, the theme song.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  What's that?  We're ugly.  We won't shut up.  And we're nauseating.  We're so annoying.  No one can take it.  When we look in the mirror to break it.  We'll give you nightmares all day long.  Like a couple of bees.  But a count of six of beetles. 
[02:30:30]  They just camped for us.  A possible award hog.  And Godzilla in leather pants.  Yes, we're both retarded.  Retarded.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both retarded.  Retarded.  They can be dead.  Her day.  We won't go away.  Here they are.  Here they are. 
[02:31:00]  Philly, just for you.  Here they are.  This is Lady Di and Marion.  Hi.  Welcome back, guys.  Big fans.  They are just fans of the show.  And they come on every so often.  And they hang out together.  So we call them the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  One of them actually works in a beer brewery.  So it's like...  We're not retarded.  No, we're not.  A little nuts.  A little crazy.  But we like to have a lot of fun. 
[02:31:30]  And a quick disclaimer.  I got to tell you.  This is not an act.  This isn't a bitch.  For real.  For real.  For real.  These two are...  Jim, you want to describe the retarded Laverne and Shirley for Philadelphia?  Go ahead, Jim.  Everyone in New York knows what they look like.  Their hair looks like dryer lint.  I don't know what that new hair do.  Hey, at least I look like Mr. Clean.  Top job.  You got a curly mullet.  Oh, she's...  Top job.  You got a curly mullet?  What did you say?  No, a mullet is when you had his hair shaved. 
[02:32:00]  And they don't shut up.  That is an awful list.  You sound like Benicio Del Toro having a stroke.  I know.  It's Benico, I heard.  Not Benicio Del Toro.  Benicio Del Toro.  He's a guinea monkey.  I don't care what his name is.  He's an actor.  He's an actor.  Okay.  You got to start watching TV more.  Well, usually on the computer, so...  We want to welcome you guys back.  And we're glad that you've got three more, hopefully another nine years.  Thank you.  Hopefully another nine years.  You're looking at us.  Oh, my God.  But, Philly, these guys are very cool. 
[02:32:30]  You'll get to know them.  You'll love them.  I'm sold.  You'll love them.  I'm sold.  That's right.  It's really rare.  Just listen to them for a week and forget.  You guys will love them.  It's very helpful.  You'll be addicted to them.  I'm about five, too.  It's rare that I meet a woman that I wouldn't even allow to lick my taint while I whack my bag.  There's very few women I wouldn't allow just to tease the taint a little bit.  I heard they had time to get together.  Oh, Stinky's feeling her hair.  I like my hair.  It looks good on me.  It looks nice on her. 
[02:33:00]  And nobody has to look good at it.  Mary, the perm is still tight.  I like it the way it's tight.  I like it.  Bill, what do you think of them?  I like it.  And you know, Stinky and Opie, I like it like this.  Tell Bill, Bill, what do you think?  If you don't like it.  The big yellow one's a sign.  The Harper Marks, six months after he passed away.  No.  I like it, Haley.  My hair is in gray.  It looks like you're getting gray hair.  That's gold pepper, honey.  No, it's gray.  It's a sign of aging. 
[02:33:30]  Is that your natural hair color?  What?  Is that your natural hair color?  Yeah.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it is.  Why?  Put your pants down.  Let's see.  It is.  Oh, my God.  Why?  If that's your natural hair color, I'd be afraid to see what's in your pants.  It would look like the cover of France that comes alive.  You're not going to know.  But, Anthony, you look like you're losing hair, too.  Like I said last Thursday, but it looks a little bit more, yeah? 
[02:34:00]  A little more.  Well, it's you coming in here every week.  Maybe I get a little receipt.  I don't come in every week.  Hey, ladies.  Yeah?  Yes.  Why don't you explain the show to Philadelphia?  It's a wonderful show.  It's a great show.  They bust on everybody, but they're great guys.  Right.  And you've got to have them there.  That's what it is.  That's all you've got.  You've got to go to Philadelphia.  Why don't you go in our place?  Why don't you go?  What was that?  Why don't you go in our place?  To Philadelphia?  Yeah, go to Philadelphia.  I know about Pittsburgh and Scranton. 
[02:34:30]  By the way, Lady Di has a crush on Anthony.  I sure do.  I'm still digging Marion, though.  What?  Hey, Philly, give these guys a week.  Anthony.  I like that.  It's like a hard-boiled egg.  I like it.  I don't like a hard-boiled egg.  I think you're tight like a hard-boiled egg.  I'm not tight.  Watch it, Anthony.  You know I don't like that.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And by the way, Philadelphia, we're having a big contest.  If anybody in Philly can keep an erection while these pigs are in the room, you win Arrowsmith tickets. 
[02:35:00]  We don't look like pigs.  And Jim Norton, you're not that funny.  You're corny.  But let me tell you.  Oh, wait.  Corny.  I thought Rick Ross was corny, but he's better than yours.  You're just saying that because you're lip-like, Vaughn.  No.  I think I'm sorry, Jim.  You don't think Jim Norton is funny?  Mary.  I don't look like a mullet.  I do you from behind, honey, so I can bury your face in the pillow, okay?  You and your curly mullet. 
[02:35:30]  You better start respecting my man, Jim Norton.  I don't like a mullet.  Get out of here.  The respect is gangster.  You and your aqua shirt and your skippies, you K-Mart-looking bitch.  I don't hate.  What do you look like?  You look like you've been longer than that.  I'm a thug, no?  You look like you came from Penn Station.  Come on, Penn Station.  You look like you came from Penn Station.  You look like you're one of those people that hang out in Newark.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Marion's cursing now.  You look like you're one of those people that are from Newark that walk down the street like, 
[02:36:00]  hey, I'm big and bad.  Newark, New Jersey.  That's hair.  Lower the glass, you look.  Hey, look, I walked down the street.  My crap don't stink.  You know, I'm cool.  I'm hip.  Yeah, you're hip, all right.  Hey, Marion.  What?  How many pounds have you lost?  About nine.  Oh, yeah.  Where'd you find them?  I lost them way too.  Where did I find them?  Obviously, if you lost them, you found them again.  Oh, shut up.  Honey, okay.  At least I had a A. 
[02:36:30]  I'm sorry, you can't say that on the air.  I lost up here too.  I don't know if you can say that on the air, but that was fun.  It's all over.  I lost nothing.  Where did you lose the weight?  We can't tell.  Your bunt?  You lost weight on your bunt.  I don't know, you know, bunt, what?  That's a half belly, half, you know, bunt.  We look like you need to lose too.  It looks like the beer that you drink.  Like, every time you say something to Marion,  every time you say something to Marion, 
[02:37:00]  she comes back with the same thing.  Like, if you call her fat, she says you're fat.  You're fat.  You're getting fat.  Anthony, you're getting a beer bite.  Marion, I weighed the same that I weighed when I got here.  Well, you look like you're getting a beer bite.  We could talk about, whatever.  Hey, Lady Di.  Yes.  She's insulting your man.  I know she is.  Kick her ass for me.  Kick her ass for me.  Smack her in the head.  Lady Di.  Smack that quat right in that friggin' head.  You don't want to see us in the box of rings, believe me.  No. 
[02:37:30]  All right, well.  We don't do that.  We don't do that.  Beat her with a strap on.  No, we don't.  We've been friends too long.  We've been friends since we were teenagers.  Oh, my God, because no one else would hang out with you.  We only fight for a couple of minutes.  And we have other people, but it's just that, you know,  you're joining the service.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Jojo.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hello, boys.  Congratulations, man.  About time.  Syndication on the pants.  Hey, thank you, Jojo.  Hey, we probably had a couple new recruits for the ONA Army  until you put the two mongoloids on.  We don't look like mongoloids.  We're not mongoloids. 
[02:38:00]  God, don't insult the mongoloids.  You look like a mongoloid.  Your ass looks like a mongoloid.  How do you know?  You've never met this guy, Jojo.  I'm tough.  Don't look at me.  I don't take crap for nobody.  All right, Max.  She doesn't.  Yeah, she doesn't.  What's going on?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  That poor friggin' husband.  You look like a baby Godzilla, man.  You look like a baby Godzilla.  Remember baby Godzilla?  She does.  If I had a picture, he would say something about that. 
[02:38:30]  I may be sure, but good things come with small packages.  Remember baby Godzilla that blew the smoke rings?  I may be sure.  Mommy's calling.  Marion.  Marion, Marion, Marion, talk into the microphone.  Yes.  So don't come at me with pasta.  I come right back at you.  Don't let me get your smoke rings, guys.  The wrist and the hair.  You look like that, Zookie.  You look like Cindy Brady.  He ate too much of Alex's cooking.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:39:00]  I don't know.  I have no idea.  She looks like Elmo started smoking crack.  He got me straight.  It was like Mr. Clean.  That's where she lost eight pounds.  The drool leaving her mouth.  You guys look like Mr. Clean.  Her hair's pulled so tight, she can no longer close her mouth.  Who is this guy?  Who is this guy?  That's Mycena Cole.  Mycena Cole.  Well, I saw you.  All right, all right, lady.  Jesus Christ.  You know, you're like, you've got less hair than him.  You're the one with the top job head, lady.  Could you put your Down syndrome mouth closer to the microphone, please? 
[02:39:30]  She does it like Baby Godzilla.  I'd like to see her and her girl fighting in a movie.  I think, uh...  I ain't gonna talk.  You're not saying nothing.  Talk.  I am talking.  You know, I made the law of talking.  Because you are doing all the talking.  You talk.  I can't take that anymore.  All right, why don't we, um...  Yeah, why don't we get the retarded of Ernest early out of the studio?  It was nice.  I'm rejected.  Why?  We'll be back.  Jesus Christ.  All right, there we go.  Good.  Bye.  Okay. 
[02:40:00]  Please.  We have right back.  All right.  They're great.  Imagine having a liver bath.  Shut up.  Why did you get...  You can't say that.  Why don't you just call her a fat C-word?  You can't use that C-word.  It's on the air, but, uh...  Sure, we all got it.  What an annoying couple of, uh...  Can I call them women?  Yeah, they're women.  And that Marion's getting all rambunctious now.  Like she thinks she's got the comeback. 
[02:40:30]  She called her fat.  She says you're fat.  She called me corny.  Goof on her hair.  She goofs on your hair.  Call them corny.  Jenna, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Good.  Um, I'm from Philadelphia.  Actually, New Hope, right near Willow Grove.  Actually.  Yeah.  Um, and I just wanted to tell you guys that you are awesome.  And I am so happy that you're on 94.1.  Ah!  Because I could barely get you on 102.7.  And I am just...  Oh, my God.  I am so excited.  Oh, cool.  Thank you. 
[02:41:00]  You're welcome.  Speaking of excited.  Boy, how am I pretty excited about that retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I would love to...  Oh, we just wrecked it bringing them in.  No, I want to see what Philly thought of the retarded Laverne.  It's all right.  Their first taste.  That's a rest of development.  They be acting like they're still seniors in junior high school.  That woman's been married for a while.  Married.  Eight kids.  Smoked crack.  Imagine.  She's been married to this guy.  We talked to him on the phone once.  And he's just like...  He kept saying... 
[02:41:30]  In between whatever he was saying, you'd hear him whistle like,  Come over and shoot me.  Come over and shoot me.  I'm in hell.  Awful.  My God.  Horrible bitches.  You have to pile back in here.  What?  Don't talk about my husband, please.  Okay?  Your husband is the sorriest son of a bitch having to be married to you.  Marion, get in here.  Marion, having to be married to you cannot be a treat.  It can't be a treat being married to you.  We've talked to your husband.  Yeah, yeah.  It is a treat being married to me.  I'm a different person than I am at home. 
[02:42:00]  Why?  Do you drop 300 pounds?  No.  No.  How different is it?  I have an attitude and I don't have an attitude.  What's wrong with it?  Attitude?  It's not an attitude.  It's just annoying.  It's not annoying.  You're annoying.  No, see?  There it goes again.  Mark, you're annoying.  Mark, you're annoying.  Mark.  I'm a psychiatrist.  You got arrested development.  You look like you need a psychiatrist.  See?  It's the same thing.  I'm a psychiatrist. 
[02:42:30]  You are married.  Hey, Marion, you got a big slong.  I got a big what?  You got a big slong.  What's that?  Big nose.  You got a big slong.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You got big slong.  Big nose.  I don't have a big slong.  No, you got a big slong.  You got a bass.  You got a slong.  You got a mustache.  That's what you got to get rid of.  All right, listen.  Freddie Laker called.  He wanted his glasses back.  When your husband...  Go ahead, Jim.  When your husband is...  What do you have?  Hold on.  Hold on, Marion. 
[02:43:00]  Let Jim speak.  When your husband is banging you, he has to think of a column by massacres to keep an erection.  Don't talk about my husband.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You want it, Van Halen?  Marion just went on cursing like a sailor.  Get out of here, fat girl with baby arms.  Get out.  She's cursing like crazy out there now. 
[02:43:30]  The best part was she had to lift her tongue up to say that stuff.  We had to dump out of like 20 seconds of the show, but basically...  She was really mad.  Jim Norton insulted Marion's husband.  Don't talk about my husband.  I actually did.  I insulted her.  Don't talk about my husband.  Talk about the rabbit.  He brought up here.  My husband is a remarkable man.  I'll get rid of my husband and make it look like an accident. 
[02:44:00]  She talks like Giuliani if you were a fat girl.  Jim, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, all man?  My husband.  My, my, my.  Go, go, go.  Down, down, down.  I got to tell you, you guys have been hysterical today.  I remember when you came into New York.  Yeah.  And it was, you know, it was the same thing.  You called it yesterday.  Yeah.  Okay.  And it's just been so hysterical listening to you today.  That's very predictable what was going to happen.  But we're having fun with it. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, that's it.  And you got to introduce Philly to, uh, to two, two, Honduras.  Yeah, we'll get, we'll get to all that, Jim.  All right.  Later, guys.  All right.  Thanks.  We can't do it all in one show.  No, no.  Jennifer is very pissed off at us.  Jennifer, what's up?  You got it.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Okay, first of all, I just want to say congratulations, but Philly, jump ship.  Put the tray tables in the upright position and grab your vomit bags, because it's a long, 
[02:45:00]  bumpy ride, Philly.  You're going to vomit.  Vomit.  Those girls are gross.  I think one of the girls hanged something yellow on the console.  What is that?  I don't know.  Holy smoke.  Look at what's on the console.  What is it?  Don't touch it.  Now, don't even look at it.  Don't touch it.  What is it?  It looks like phlegm.  It's yellow.  Dude, she's hacked phlegm all over the console. 
[02:45:30]  Look, it's burning through like alien acid blood.  Now she's lost eight and a half pounds.  The hull has been compromised.  It smells like White Castle.  You can't dust for vomit.  Don't talk about my husband.  We've got to get her back in here.  He's got enough problems being married to me.  Hey, we have annoying laugh Anthony on the phone.  Yes?  Nogwa!  Nogwa! 
[02:46:00]  Godzuki.  Baby Godzilla.  Baby Godzilla.  Nogwa!  See you later.  All right.  How much do you have to drink on the O&A drinking game if Limo Anthony does an impression?  You've got to boot heroin.  We have to take a quick break.  Thank God.  Who's going outside?  Not me.  Not me.  Dude, she is still really pissed off.  She's steaming.  Well, open the door.  Let's see how pissed she still is.  Marion, don't make me mad at her.  Don't talk about my husband.  Get ready on the dump button.  I'd say cage match. 
[02:46:30]  Jim Norton and Marion.  Marion?  That's right.  All right.  Hold on, Marion.  Signed up.  It could bring a few quick bits on the open market.  Hey, Sarah, you want to wrestle?  I would not.  If wrestling doesn't require touching, we can do it.  Yes.  Marion, we've talked about your husband before.  Why all of a sudden his defensive posture?  I don't like it.  Okay.  I don't like it.  Why?  What happened now?  Nothing.  Your husband's starting to give you a little crap about being on the show.  No, no, no, no.  He listens to the show.  But I just don't like the idea of bringing my husband until my husband don't know you. 
[02:47:00]  He listens to the show.  He's never met him.  We've talked to him on the phone.  I think we've talked about a great relationship.  And these guys did.  But when it comes to something like that, I don't like it.  Okay?  What did you hack up on the console?  Look at that.  Look at what you hacked up.  What?  Right there.  You hacked up a frigging Tribble.  I don't know what that is.  I did not.  That came out of your car.  You did not.  I saw it.  It didn't come out of nothing.  I would appreciate it.  Go and eat a rocking chair once.  Anthony, I would appreciate it. 
[02:47:30]  Don't talk about my husband, okay?  Wow, look at that look she's giving you.  Really?  She means it, too, man.  She means it.  You go in the cage.  I'm Irish.  Go in the water.  You don't want me to get my Irish temper.  Marion's in the water.  Our Marion.  Farewell and adieu to you, fair-stunished lady.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I'm sorry people got tampered.  Boy, do we have...  Spit out that little Kittner boy all over the console.  Anthony?  What the hell is that?  Yes, L.P.?  She can't hear...  I know.  She can't hear us right now?  Yeah, why?  I'm sure people have tampered. 
[02:48:00]  They also have metabolisms.  Yeah.  I want...  Yeah.  Set up.  Hold on, hold on.  What do you need, L.P.?  Someone talk to Marion.  Yeah.  You got to get it going again.  You have, like, ten guys between you and her.  Let's talk about her husband again.  Marion, how much do you think your husband wants a nice, skinny, tanned ass as opposed  to your ass?  I'm not a husband the way I am, but I don't appreciate...  Do you think so?  Absolutely not.  I don't appreciate you talking about my husband.  He probably punches porno up on the website and jerks it every night to a hot, sweet, little 
[02:48:30]  nymph ass.  Hey, you got something to say about my husband.  I got something to say about your girlfriend, too.  Hey.  I would rather not.  Hey, Marion.  I feel like it's not right.  Marion, I'm talking about your husband.  He's a nice guy.  He is a nice guy, but he's never met.  He's a nice guy.  Does it look like that down below?  That hairstyle?  It's not your business.  A little wookie.  Does that look like that down below?  Yes.  That was good.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no.  I got one.  All right.  It's a wookie down there.  Psycho Mark. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Put a bullet in both of their heads and just dump them in a river, will ya?  You want the job?  What is that?  You want the job?  Oh, absolutely.  I'll be right over.  Mark!  Hey, I think your husband's got cancer to Bali.  I think your husband has cancer to Bali?  That's too bad.  How you doing, Psycho Mark?  Okay, listen.  I don't like you.  I heard he's not been told.  All right.  I don't like you.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break. 
[02:49:30]  No one can understand my kid touch airways.  We'll be back with the O.P. Anthony show.  O.P. Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  What have I had right by my side?  Sam Adams.  An icy cold Sam Adams lager.  I love it.  We're going back and pounding some down in the office after the show.  Could someone just hit Sam with a train full of AIDS? 
[02:50:00]  They're still yelling and screaming out there.  We should have her husband do a Sam Adams commercial and tell us how many he has to drink before he can finally bang her.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We love Sam.  Sam, got the passion, independence in brewing, and produced some of the best beers in the world.  Trade up Sam Adams for all of your important events, like after this show.  Actually, right now, Sam Adams.  All right. 
[02:50:30]  We're going to play a little round of what did we learn next.  Yes.  New York, help us out with this one today, okay?  What did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  O.P. Anthony.  All right, it's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The first day of syndication.  I think it went quite well, Anthony.  Yes.  I want to thank the gang for coming by to help us out today. 
[02:51:00]  More of the gang tomorrow on our radio show.  Steven Lynch, great new song today.  Jim Norton, thank you.  Brother Joe, thank you.  Always a pleasure.  We should play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today, huh?  Yeah.  We love this game.  What did we learn?  I believe it was educational.  We are very educational.  Yeah.  Old Dirty, thanks for stopping by today.  All right.  Showing some love.  Let's go to the phones and play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[02:51:30]  Derek, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Today I learned that the O.P. and Anthony show is spreading.  Yes, it is.  Good night, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dan.  Hey, Dan, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned the only people left in Philadelphia that you haven't completely discussed are the Amish.  They don't have the radio.  Stay tuned tomorrow.  All right.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned three things.  Number one of it, I learned that retarded Laverne's show, you're like a public service announcement 
[02:52:00]  that's why you shouldn't smoke crack when you're pregnant.  Yeah.  I learned how much fun phase one really can be.  And I got my favorite Jim Norton line, why don't you go drink AIDS at a picnic?  Thank you, Brian.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, this is phase one, the purge.  We understand.  Patrick.  And there's a lot of people pissed off in Philadelphia today.  Yes, Anthony.  Patrick from the Bronx, when people from Philadelphia say, you guys suck, they really mean it. 
[02:52:30]  Let's go to Dylan.  Dylan, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned three things.  I learned crib death is funny.  I learned Philadelphia is the home of gay incest.  And I learned that Anthony looks just like Lady Di.  Wait a minute.  Oh, is that one of the no-nos?  Yeah, you can't say that, but we got it.  Dylan, use the alphabet.  We're good at that.  Anthony looks just like Lady Di, except with a C.  Okay, good job.  All right, later.  Marion.  I know, he screwed up the whole damn thing.  John, what's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hey. 
[02:53:00]  I learned today that Philly will start to accept you guys in about two and a half years  when your contract negotiations are coming to again.  Yeah.  It shows it much better when Opie's a little pissed off.  Well, I'll get pissed off.  There's plenty of things to still be pissed about, all right?  Okay, guys.  Well, good luck.  All right.  Thank you.  Ernio says, never introduce Earl first.  No.  That was such a mistake today.  Mike, what's going on?  I learned that cartoon characters live.  They'll probably get to the Amish tomorrow.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Congratulations, Steve.  All right.  Thank you.  Beat.  Let's go to Mookie.  Hey, Mookie, what did you learn today?  Yeah, I learned that Philadelphia is not really loved.  I don't know.  We found a couple positives.  Yeah, it's going to take a while for them, the guys.  I don't see it taking any longer than it took here in New York, because it was brutal here.  Yes.  We forget.  Yes.  All right.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you.  You bastards killed us when we first got here.  Wow.  Okay. 
[02:54:00]  You've been to fag days, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you know, I was there, kid.  Sue, what's going on?  How are you?  Pretty good.  I'm on my way home to Philadelphia from Queens every week, and I look forward to listening  to you guys, was real disappointed last week, and I'm happy back again.  Thanks.  That you're here.  Cool.  And I'm going to tell you, Philadelphia is not ready for Laverne and Shirley and Patty  Stalker.  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty, yeah.  Especially not in the same room at the same time.  We might have to introduce Stalker Patty tomorrow.  And I'm going to warn you now, you know, what's in my pants may be a little bit... 
[02:54:30]  Oh, they loved what's in my pants.  That was good, right?  Yeah.  The girl was from Philadelphia.  Thank you, sir.  Lawyer Steve from Jersey, I learned that Marco and his brother will be moving to Philadelphia.  Mike from upstate New York, I learned that Philly really loves their classic rock.  All right, there's so many, but we really have to go.  Yeah, now we've got to leave.  This was a good start, right?  Come on, a lot of fun.  I think.  The first day it's going to be king.  I think. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Thank you.  See you, punk?  It's going.  Get it on.  On tomorrow's show, we've got Laura Corn, Anthony, the sexpert.  Very funny lady.  Isn't Jay Moore coming in tomorrow?  Jay Moore's coming in tomorrow.  And John Sally.  Mm-hmm.  Going through the...  What are we learning?  I learned first you purge, then you binge.  Mm-hmm.  Mark has a good one.  Mark, what did you learn on the show?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned that this Philadelphia experiment is going just about as well as the first one did. 
[02:55:30]  If only Marion's head would be embedded in the floor,  it would be perfect.  Take it easy, guys.  Okay, thank you.  I think we have time for one more.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim?  No.  He's gone.  All right.  That's too bad.  We've got a lot of great what-do-we-learns, but I think that's it for today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Jim, thank you.  Mike D. Nicole, Steve Lynch, Old Dirty, and the rest of the gang.  Brother Joe, of course. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  We'll do it again tomorrow.  Yeah.  Well, no, tomorrow, I don't think you're going to get the personalized attention.  All right.  In Philly.  Guys, we'll see you tomorrow at 3.  Thanks.  O.P.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W.N.E.W.  All right, Anthony.  Hey.  We're still live.  Yeah.  Philly has left us.  Left the building.  I think that went well today.  Yeah.  They're in their own commercials right now.  I think we gave them enough to digest for one day. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, they'll have to sleep on it now.  Wake up screaming in a cold sweat from their nightmares, and then tune in again tomorrow.  Let them try to figure out what the hell just happened.  Who isn't going to...  Like, I'm trying to imagine, all right?  It's Philly.  I've lived in Philly.  I don't know who the hell Opie and Anthony are.  I tune my radio.  I hear what I heard today.  I can't imagine not checking in tomorrow just to see what the F this is all about.  You know, we could goof on W.Y.S.P. now. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're not listening to us right now.  You've got to hear what they're playing out of commercials to get back into the radio show.  Oh, my God.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Oh, no, but I'm not going to go.  What is it for?  W.Y.S.P.  What's up?  All right.  Only on 94.  W.Y.S.P.  All right. 
[02:57:30]  Well, I think we're going to have to change that.  What the frick was that?  That's what they're playing.  Get the other one.  Holy Jesus.  What the hell was that?  What's your dumbbells?  Anthony, the ultimate V.  We're going to get another one.  Ultimate V.  That's right.  You're under a little bit of stress.  You can't get it going. 
[02:58:00]  You know, sex.  Ultimate V for the ultimate O.  Clinical findings prove that there's a combination of herbs and ultimate V equal the effects of the leading prescription enhancement product.  I think you know which one we're talking about.  Ultimate V, serious product for people who are serious about sex.  Makes good sex great.  Great sex phenomenal.  Ultimate V is guaranteed.  No risk.  It works.  The packets fit right in your wallet or pocket, just like your roofies.  And it's convenient. 
[02:58:30]  The best part, it's for men and women.  Ultimate V is great for women, so you'll never have a bitch saying, I got a headache anymore.  Unless, of course, you cave her head in with a spade shovel.  I'm teasing, of course.  Ultimate V.  Call now, 1-888-808-8800, 1-888-808-8800, or on the web, ultimatev.net.  What's the matter?

[02:59:00]  For the ultimate O, it's ultimate V.  Do you want to hear another sweeper they're playing?  No.  Obviously, in New York, you're not hearing these things.  This is what they're doing in Philadelphia.  Coming back to the commercials to get back to our syndicated radio show.  Listen to this one.  Opie and Anthony, the new afternoon show on 94-WYSB.  Opie and Anthony, 94-WYSB. 
[02:59:30]  Opie and Anthony, rock on 94-WYSB.  Brand new in our game.  Opie and Anthony, only on Philadelphia's number one rock station.  94-WYSB.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass. 
[03:00:00]  That was awful.  I know, dude.  Wow, what is that?  We're going to have to work on that.  That's awful.  We've just begun.  We've got to work out a lot of things.  Why don't you fill it up with your dumbbells?  What do you expect out of Philly?  They can still hear us in, like, you know, northern Philly.  Good.  All right, listen, jingles.  Before we get off the air, how many we got?  Three.  Three pairs?  We got three pairs of tickets to see Aerosmith with special guest fuel at the PNC Arts Center. 
[03:00:30]  In Jersey, of course, this Sunday.  The show is sold out, but if you want to go, three random callers will get tickets.  212-757-1027.  A few tickets for the June 12th show still available through Ticketmaster.  Right.  It was interesting.  We'll do it again tomorrow, right?  Let's rock. </pre>
