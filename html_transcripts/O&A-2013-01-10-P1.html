<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a game, "What's Wrong with Opie Today?", revealing Opie's missing headphones, which unexpectedly launched a fiery debate on gun control.  The discussion involved copious amounts of vulgar language and offensive comments directed at Jon Stewart, Barack Obama, Glenn Beck, and the NRA. Opie vehemently defended his Second Amendment rights, while Anthony criticized the NRA's response to Sandy Hook and advocated for addressing societal issues alongside gun restrictions. Jim Norton contributed perspectives on free speech and potential government overreach.  A caller from Connecticut offered a contrasting view, focusing on parental responsibility regarding children with mental health issues. The segment concluded with speculation about “smart guns.”

The show continued with a discussion about technology tracking drivers to prevent drunk driving, questioning its intrusiveness and effectiveness.  This segued into another gun control debate, sparked by a toy gun, touching upon Wayne LaPierre's recent speech.  Comedian Joe DeRosa guested, participating in the "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?" bit.  Other topics included the media frenzy surrounding Catherine Webb, the girlfriend of an Alabama football player, and the ensuing apologies from sports commentators; Britney Spears' departure from *The X Factor*; the steroid use debate in baseball; and the Boston flu outbreak and Mayor Menino's response.  The segment was rife with vulgar language and sexual innuendo.

Next, the hosts engaged in a “fuck you” segment, unleashing expletive-laden insults at various targets including AIDS, beer, a cop, and Sam.  They then discussed their awkward interview with Jimmy "Superfly" Snooker, including a joke about "muff diving," and debated how to digitally remove an unwanted individual from a photo taken with Snooker. The show shifted to Oscar predictions, followed by a lengthy, relentlessly teasing call with listener Bobo, hopelessly infatuated with a woman in England.  This included sexually suggestive banter with Bobo's girlfriend, Katie, who was also on the phone.  The segment ended with a discussion of a customer service ranking, placing Sirius XM third worst, and self-deprecating jokes,  followed by playing a song and discussing upcoming programming.

The final segment included a montage of "Radio Voice Hall of Fame" entries, featuring Bubba the Love Sponge.  The hosts then discussed George Lucas's fiancée, using sexually explicit and derogatory language.  They played 911 calls about a "lion" (a Labradoodle), showed a video of an invisible car prank with racially charged commentary, and discussed Bill Maher's bet with Donald Trump regarding Trump's parentage.  They debated whether they'd let their wives sleep with someone else for a large sum of money, mentioning Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore.  Jimmy's upcoming stand-up appearances were announced, along with a bit involving Wrestlemania tickets and a farting bet, and a discussion about Jimmy potentially appearing on a former colleague's radio show. The show concluded with the "Line of the Day"—a racist joke—and discussions of other runner-up lines and Pat Benatar's age, interspersed with several commercial breaks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All aboard. All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flasher. 
[00:00:30]  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and balls.  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah.  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the ground. 
[00:01:00]  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  He's cock.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony.  The rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton.  Lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass, because it makes me feel like I have  to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everybody.  Ooh, look at us.  We're broadcasting.  We're playing a game.  Called, What's Wrong with Opie Today?  Yeah.  And I figured it out.  Oh, you did?  You did?  I have.  Yes, I have.  Anyone else figure it out? 
[00:02:00]  Give me.  I haven't.  No.  Is it?  Let me see.  I'm not gonna ask any questions.  I wonder if it's physical.  Oh, I'm fine.  Don't start with that physical.  No, no, I don't know.  I'm fine.  I swear.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  Is it work-related?  Of course it is.  All right.  I don't have these types of problems when I leave here.  Isn't it amazing when you walk out this door?  It's like when Dorothy walked out of the fucking house. 
[00:02:30]  It's all in color.  As much as I'm having fun, I have way more problems and stress here than going home to  two tiny kids.  You have no idea, huh?  Does it have anything to do with show preparation?  Jimmy knows, though, so you can't ask questions.  Does it have anything to do with a guy that looks like a cue ball?  You would be a horrendous eyewitness.  Anthony would be the worst eyewitness. 
[00:03:00]  I know Jimmy knows.  Sam doesn't know.  You guys would be horrendous witnesses.  It's the Jews, guys.  You're so not observant.  What is wrong with me right now?  I know, I know, I know.  All right, don't say it.  Two out of three, no.  I know.  I know Ant doesn't give a fuck about anyone, but this is an obvious one.  I know you notice, I know you don't notice half the crap that goes on around you because  you don't care.  No, I just actually, I don't notice things. 
[00:03:30]  Obviously.  I have a weird mental thing.  This is a, this is one of those logic games.  And then when you, when I tell you the answer, you're going to go, okay, I should have known  right away.  So it's something visible?  So obvious.  So obvious.  Does it rhyme with homosexual?  Uh, well, okay, I see some, I see some, um, and this isn't supposed to take this discs 
[00:04:00]  in front of you, but that's good.  I see the, the prep sheet, right?  This is, this is, this is so obvious.  This isn't one where you're going to go, wow, what the fuck?  You're going to be like, oh, duh.  Is something missing from your area?  Maybe.  Maybe something's missing from the area.  Okay.  If we're, if, if that's an official question, yes, something's missing from my area.  All right.  Uh, you got a mic.  Got a mic.  See that?  Yes.  Your chair, your coffee. 
[00:04:30]  Are you, um, you, you, you sucked at, uh, where's Waldo, huh?  Yeah, I really did.  I, I, I do have my strong suits, but like, yeah, observational skills.  And you know, you know, when in the dentist, you had that, that, that book and it had two  pictures and you're like, well, what's different between the two pictures?  There's five things different.  I wasn't good at that.  Obviously.  I'm not really obviously.  Um, Jimmy, you really know?  Oh yeah.  I've known for this before the watch run.  Ha ha. 
[00:05:00]  This is hilarious.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  This is hilarious.  You knew before we started the game?  Yeah.  Uh, no, once you said, what's wrong?  Okay.  Fat.  Sam's got it.  Definitely.  Oh my God.  This is hilarious.  Oh my God.  Well, okay.  Hold it.  I got it.  Oh, you stink.  And I blew it by putting my hands up.  No, no.  I, I, okay.  That's crazy.  I went like this.  Oh, you're crazy.  Yeah.  Opie has no headphones. 
[00:05:30]  This is kind of important.  I didn't notice.  I don't know, I don't know what you, I don't know what you guys look like without headphones.  Wow.  I have no idea.  I just assume you guys walk around like that.  It looks weird to see you talking in the mic without a headphone.  Yes.  Oh, ah.  Oh, hi Mars.  Marcelino.  Wow.  Did you check the studio today?  Yeah, I had.  Oh, man.  Oh my God.  Oh, Mars. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, Mars.  I screwed up.  Oh, you screwed up, Mars.  Who fucked up you?  I put him away for some reason.  I, I get it.  I get it.  I'm not needed.  I get it.  I'll just go home.  I understand what you're trying to tell the people.  Mars.  Oh, look, they're all tangled.  Oh, man.  You got a hell of a dally storm there, my friend.  Oh, come on, Mars.  What are you doing?  We got work to do.  What the fuck?  Now you're panicking.  Look, it's all twisted.  That's like sink, the slinkies all twisted together. 
[00:06:30]  If you had to get your Puerto Rican knife out of your fucking back pocket, you would  panic and fumble.  Sorry.  That probably would have been better if I knew how it sounded in my ears.  Man.  Maybe that would have helped that dumb line.  Oh.  Thank you, Mars.  Sorry.  Now I'm ready to broadcast.  Oh.  Hey.  Now I see.  Now I can hear everyone.  Now I see.  You didn't have headphones.  How do you not notice that?  I don't know.  I know what's wrong.  I'm an idiot. 
[00:07:00]  I don't get it.  Well, now.  Now we can broadcast.  There we are.  Now we can officially broadcast.  There we are.  I'm a little worried, though, because my headphone volume now is really loud on my side, so I'm  afraid if we play something, it's going to get real loud.  Huh?  Is everything set where it usually is?  I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  I think so.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  There it is.  How is everyone?  Wonderbar.  Wonderful.  Glenn Beck calling your pal crazy. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Alex Jones.  And Jon Stewart saying Alex Jones is worried about the imaginary Hitler.  Yeah.  Well, Jon Stewart is a self-hating Jew.  Wow.  Who is embracing certain policies and actions that resulted in the death of many of his  ancestors during Nazi Germany, which is a leader taking executive privilege.  Uh, the, uh, removal of, of, uh, guns from the populace, uh, lists of people, guilt lists 
[00:08:00]  of, uh, of, of, of law-abiding citizens.  So Jon Stewart can shove it up his fuck hole.  We used to have Jon Stewart on the show.  What happened?  He's a cunt and I can't stand Jon Stewart.  Wow.  What happened?  He's an asshole.  Wow.  What happened?  Keep praising Barack Hussein Obama, who, uh, is, is turning this, uh, country into a,  a, literally a socialist nation and, uh, quite possibly some kind of a, a fascist country 
[00:08:30]  where he is the titular head.  I'm tired of it.  They're not going to take you guys.  Yeah.  You know what?  Keep saying it.  Keep saying it until you get, Cuomo, the governor, already spoke, uh, uh, yesterday about his  sweeping gun control.  It sounded like some kind of a fucking Nuremberg rally.  Really?  Everyone's cheering him.  And, and he's talking about, uh, sweeping changes in, uh, assault weapon bans, which are  already in place.  Will you be able to carry? 
[00:09:00]  With, uh, Cuomo's new, uh, laws?  I, I don't know what I'm going to be allowed to do until they fucking come out because you  know what?  They never talk about him as they're doing them.  Like fucking Biden was talking about the, uh, uh, weapons, uh, weapons legislation and  the fact that Barack Obama and the fact that Barack Obama might use executive privilege,  but he didn't say on what now that wasn't discussed bullshit.  That's his transparent fucking administration again, not discussed. 
[00:09:30]  But they never say until it comes out and they say, here's the new rules you got to  abide by, but they never tell us what it is.  So I don't know.  But, but yeah.  The gun lobby is extremely powerful.  It's fucking wounded right now.  The gun lobby is extremely powerful.  Let me tell you, the tragedy, the tragedy of the Sandy Hook shooting is exactly what they  wanted.  Some of these vultures, I wouldn't doubt, are happy that children are dead because it gets  them to pass their fuck agenda. 
[00:10:00]  That ain't going to do shit except fuck with law abiding legal citizens.  Crime will not drop.  These shootings will not stop.  It will just stop the American people from being, uh, every day exercise a basic right.  Number two motherfuckers.  Right.  Number two.  That's the, that's the speech somebody gives as they're being dragged out of a court of  law.  No kidding.  Through the front doors.  With their fucking feet kicking against it.  How did you get more angry than me?  I don't know.  When did that happen?  I mean, it's been years now, I think. 
[00:10:30]  I'm tired.  You're definitely more angry than me.  I'm so tired of this.  I'm not going to take you guys.  The gun lobby is extremely powerful.  They're wounded right now.  I won't be the gun lobby.  They're wounded.  They're wounded a bit.  They look like idiots.  LaPierre got on.  He's an out-of-touch guy.  I don't, I don't appreciate when the head of the NRA, an organization that I support,  is, it looks like an idiot.  I don't, I, Alex Jones, I don't care.  Everyone knows he's kooky.  So when you get somebody like fucking Glenn Beck saying he's kooky, it's two kooks calling  the kook kooky.  But you were all about Alex Jones yesterday, so now you're kooky. 
[00:11:00]  No, no, I love him.  But he was crazy.  He was fine yesterday.  Obviously, if we started talking about Building 7, we wouldn't be agreeing.  We were talking about one specific subject, gun control, and we do agree on that matter.  But I think the guy's a stark raving fucking lunatic, obviously.  Maybe 75% of them.  Right.  I like the 25% of Alex Jones.  Yes.  Yes.  But look, this right now is a knee-jerk thing.  Me and Opie were talking right before the show.  We don't talk.  Oh, right. 
[00:11:30]  Opie and I.  Opie and I.  Let's not make believe we talk.  We don't talk ever.  But you heard me today because you usually have your headphones on and don't listen.  But I, it was, we were talking about the fact that knee-jerk reactions to radio.  Oh, yeah.  Radio.  Well, we live in a country that is a knee-jerk society.  Knee-jerk society.  And we know it, and yeah, we always bring it on, we bring it back to something that we do know about.  We can relate to it.  And it's, and it's, and it's what they did with radio because of a few fucking bad eggs. 
[00:12:00]  And we were, we were some of the bad eggs.  Well.  Let's be honest.  Perhaps.  We might have even started the whole thing if you really want to, want to like focus on it.  But what harm did it do?  We might have been the ones that pushed that old rock.  Oh, boy.  Down the hill.  And it just got faster and faster and it knocked out a lot of radio guys.  We used to do, yeah.  But the point being that they destroyed radio.  Destroyed terrestrial radio.  It's not even, it's not even, it doesn't even resemble what it used to be as far as fun and entertainment.  And they figured out they could, they could keep their business models going because they decided that people will listen to sports talk and they will listen to pop music. 
[00:12:30]  But that's basically what you get now on regular radio.  Because it's safe.  Everyone wants safe.  But with safe, you take away that thing that makes things entertaining, funny.  It makes America, America.  Yes.  And I'm not talking making it absolutely dangerous, but a little, a little, a bit of unknown there.  As far as radio goes, we used to do stunts and fun things and games and shit like that.  The lawyers have put the kibosh and all that. 
[00:13:00]  Because out of all the radio contests that have happened through radio history with all the shows and all the people, a few people have died in freak fucking accidents.  Because of that minuscule amount that got on the news and made noise, they put a stop to all the fun.  Everything.  Because we are a knee-jerk nation that looks at something and goes, that's a big problem.  Guns, the same fucking thing.  Look, these are tragedies.  I'm not underplaying how horrid these things are.  But in the context of 300 million people, 300 million guns in this country, it's minuscule the amount of guns that are out there that are actually being used in murders and crimes. 
[00:13:30]  Many of the gun deaths, they say 11,000, are legitimate shootings from law officers, from civilians that are thwarting assaults on themselves.  It's something like 8,000 of those are legitimate shootings. 
[00:14:00]  You know what would be a great scene is if you just made that speech and you pan back and you realize you're talking to a bunch of three-year-olds.  And I'm nude.  They might get a couple little things done.  No, this is big, Opie.  When I said that Barack Obama in his second term will start going after guns, this is before his inauguration, into his second term.  And already he's trying to put forth most of the sweeping gun legislation ever. 
[00:14:30]  Well, it's before his inauguration because of what happened in Sandy Hook.  Well, yeah, again, knee-jerk reaction to something, but it fits his agenda regardless.  Well, I don't know if it's completely a knee-jerk reaction.  I mean, there's a lot of parents out there that have had it because they see their own fucking kids in that school that day.  It's not going to help.  But I'm just saying that's where the mindset is.  Of course.  I think we have to do a lot more than look at the gun problem in this country.  For some reason, the mainstream media wants to just focus on the gun issue when there's so many factors that play into this. 
[00:15:00]  Cuomo is ready to move.  I mean ready to fucking move with legislation here in New York.  Which, by the way, New York already has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation.  Well, let's see what Cuomo said.  Oh!  Gun violence has been on a rampage, as we know firsthand, and we know painfully.  We must stop the madness, my friends. 
[00:15:30]  And in one word, it's just enough.  It has been enough.  Okay.  We need a gun policy in this state that is reasonable, that is balanced, that is measured.  We respect hunters and sportsmen.  All right, pause.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  That sounds logical.  Cuomo.  Cuomo!  Contrary to popular belief, the Second Amendment is not about hunters and sportsmen. 
[00:16:00]  He said, I hunt, I have a shotgun, I have this.  Great!  Good for you!  The Second Amendment is not about the right to hunt!  It's the right to bear arms, and it was always about curtailing tyranny.  What are you scared of?  I'm scared...  What are you scared of?  ...that I am not going to be able to exercise my Second Amendment right.  Wouldn't you be scared you're not able to exercise your first? 
[00:16:30]  We already can't.  We've had certain instances where that seems to have been the case, and it angers you.  And it angers me.  It should anger everybody.  Well, the Second Amendment is another right that is in place to keep this nation like we  are, a free nation.  The NRA had a chance, a big chance, with that speech, and they misjudged that...  You're right, that Wayne LaPierre...  It was terrible.  ...is a...  That was a horrible fucking speech.  Yes.  And people just went...  And I'm for the Second Amendment. 
[00:17:00]  I was like, ugh, a right...  Believe me, I was watching...  Not one ounce of give from that guy.  Not one...  You need a little give and take, right?  ...ounce of give.  And then people were like, you know what?  We've heard what you have to say.  Fuck you.  But I'm telling you, that was a big shot for the NRA, and he blew it.  But the people that have the agendas, a lot of the Democrats, a lot of the liberals, especially  here in New York, they have a gun control agenda.  Regardless of what LaPierre said, if he went up there and spoke so eloquently about gun control 
[00:17:30]  or the lack thereof and Second Amendment rights, it wouldn't have mattered.  Because when you get something like Sandy Hook, it fits their agenda.  It's a perfect opportunity to use people's emotion and the news and everything else to  put in place laws that will do nothing about these shootings.  Not Second Amendment, but what he should have talked about, was something that no one's  ever heard from the NRA before, or was just some sort of whatever it was that would make 
[00:18:00]  getting certain things harder.  Like, if he had just seemed, like, as horrified and as willing to go, you know what, there  really is a point to this.  Perhaps he could have been a better politician.  But, no, I mean a little bit more...  That's what I mean.  ...completely...  Because, even on the other side, you're not getting sincerity.  I mean, you're not going to get sincerity out of this guy.  And the guy is supposed to be a pit bull, an attack dog for Second Amendment rights.  He's not supposed to give.  Because you give, they will fucking take 20 times what you want to give them. 
[00:18:30]  It's, unfortunately, that's where we live in, in the country we live in.  But that's the way Sharpton looks at it.  That's the way they all look at it.  That's what all special interest groups look at it.  But you're always going to get liberal agendas through easier because you can play off...  Cuomo is...  Let's play the rest of the clip.  All right.  What is he trying to say here?  This is not taking away people's guns.  All right.  That's what they say.  I own a gun.  I own a Remington shotgun.  I've hunted.  I've shot. 
[00:19:00]  That's not what this is about.  It is about ending the unnecessary risk of high-capacity assault rifles.  That's what this is about.  Oh, shut up.  He's got a gun.  Which means...  He's got a gun.  Taking guns.  I mean, what is he going to do?  There are 300 million guns out there, many of which will fall into the category of assault weapon.  How many?  That will be bad.  I don't know the exact number. 
[00:19:30]  But I'm sure it's a fuckload of AR-15 type...  Over a million?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Over a million?  Out of the 330 million guns we have in this country?  Way over a million.  Is that about right?  We have 330 million guns?  Way over a million.  We have one gun per person at this point.  Yeah, it's a lot of guns.  That is a lot of guns.  But the fact of the matter is, these assault weapons, it won't do anything taking them out  of the hands and the ability of law-abiding citizens to buy them. 
[00:20:00]  Now, what he wants to do, what we already have in New York, I can't buy a gun without  it being recorded, legally, I can't buy a gun without it being recorded, that I own  it.  Serial number, background check with every gun I buy.  If I buy a gun on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday I decide I want to go in and buy another gun,  it's another fucking background check.  Again, they don't take that, a day went by, well, we checked him yesterday, he should  be okay.  Every gun I buy has a background check done on me.  It's already in place in New York. 
[00:20:30]  And this motherfucker now wants to limit the guns I can buy?  So how many guns you got?  He wants ammunition.  They want now a background check when I buy ammunition.  And I'm like, you know what?  It's not the worst thing in the world, is it?  It's not the worst thing in the world until the next step comes, where it's like, well,  we want you to buy a limited amount of ammunition.  A background check.  Or if you buy a certain amount of ammunition, we're going to start looking into your shit.  I don't want that!  But why not? 
[00:21:00]  You're not a criminal.  I don't care.  I don't want it.  I don't want it.  Jimmy, you get up on stage.  Yes, I do.  Yes.  You say certain things.  You comment on the president, you comment on politics, whatever it is.  They all of a sudden want to know, Jimmy, we want you to sit down, we want to talk to  you about why you're saying these things.  And then if you say it again next week, we're going to talk to you about that.  Now, it sounds ridiculous, but it's not.  You are talking about a First Amendment right and a Second Amendment right, and them questioning  why I'm doing certain things with that right. 
[00:21:30]  But the difference is, what is the lead up to it?  What's the lead up to it?  I haven't done anything.  No, no, you haven't.  There are people that speak, just like you do, that have incited riots, that have incited  hate and murder.  So it's speech, oh, speech is very dangerous.  But comedy hasn't.  Who's to say who's influenced by that, Jimmy?  You're crazy.  But people, though.  I haven't done anything with my guns.  I haven't done anything horrible.  So why shouldn't I be able to exercise my Second Amendment right in its entirety, the 
[00:22:00]  way it's fucking written, and not be infringed upon like you can with First Amendment and  free speech?  You look at the Second Amendment very, very literally.  I do.  No, no, I don't.  And a lot of people do.  I don't honor it that way.  I honor it to a certain degree, but I don't honor it, meaning that people can have whatever  they want without, I don't, even if that's the way the forefathers, if that's the way  the forefathers meant it, I don't care.  I know the muscular argument's very old, but I still.  It doesn't work. 
[00:22:30]  But I think it has merit to it, because I just don't believe that they understood.  How about this, Jimmy?  You're standing on a soapbox back in 17 fucking 90 or whatever the fuck it is.  Yes, maybe in Nashville, perhaps.  Maybe in Nashville.  Nashville, why in Nashville?  Where Jimmy Norton's going to be.  Oh.  You're speaking to people, and you're talking about some type of dissent with the government.  They look at you and go, well, you know what?  He's got the freedom to say that.  Freedom of speech.  Got that.  Now you fast forward to now. 
[00:23:00]  Wait a minute.  He's got a Twitter account.  He's got this.  He's speaking to millions of people now.  Now his message of hate or dissent or whatever the fuck it is, is now reaching more people  than the forefathers ever imagined at meeting.  Now my argument can be, they never meant you to speak to so many people at once.  Although back then.  You have such an influence now over so many more people, because of technology, we have  to do something about this First Amendment.  They did have the speech like that then, just not the immediacy of it.  Like, the papers quoted people, politicians were, like, when Lincoln spoke. 
[00:23:30]  A single person never, ever had the contact with the American people in the numbers that  they have right now.  Correct.  But also, there are certain penalties, like if I was to go on Twitter, I had to, believe  me, I had to edit myself yesterday, because there was a certain CEO of a company that  got a bailout.  I'm not going to say any more.  Uh-huh.  All I was doing was wanting to figure out how can I encourage people to murder this guy  on Twitter?  Like, how can I even joke about it? 
[00:24:00]  And I realized I couldn't.  Yeah.  So I wanted to say something that, that freedom might have been infringed on had I said something  like, like, there are things you can say now, which because so many people could hear  it, and all of a sudden, you get a knock at the door, but that does happen.  And comedy rarely sparks violence.  I can't think of a case where it's ever sparked violence.  Yeah, they're two very different situations.  Where we've ever known it sparked violence.  And as far as the forefathers go, because everyone brings it up, what would they think today?  It's really simple.  If the forefathers were living today, half of them would be, uh, you know, four gun control 
[00:24:30]  and the other half would be like, fuck that.  Good point.  That's a great point.  Of course that's how it would be.  That's true.  Yes.  That's exactly how it would be, because I'm so sick of what do you think the forefathers  mean?  Yeah, yeah.  If you fast forward them to this fucking, uh, year, they, half would be for it and half  would be against.  Period.  That's how our stupid country works.  You bring up the fact that, uh, you don't think, uh, comedy has, uh, spurred a lot  of violence.  Sparked violence?  Sparked violence?  No.  Now, now, but let me tell you something.  You don't think that maybe some nut job listening to Bill Hicks could have been influenced to, 
[00:25:00]  uh, want to commit violence against George Bush?  I don't know.  Could it?  Could a lunatic have thought that?  Yeah, but sure.  Sure.  Well, yeah, we don't live in a perfect society.  Sure.  All right.  Just like guns.  Of course, a mental patient that gets his hands on it.  But that didn't happen, though.  What do you mean?  We know no one did anything because of Bill Hicks' material.  How do you know somebody didn't hear a comic is a nut and went out and did some, some...  We don't have a case of it.  And because you're a smart guy, you can make an argument because you're a good debater.  You can take any point and lead it to another point. 
[00:25:30]  Like, and that's, you know, it's a sign of being a smart person.  Oh, Jimmy.  But I'm serious.  But you, you know, and I both know, like, the difference between doing dumb jokes and  threats are taken very seriously.  There are verbal things.  But, you know, no, violence has never been...  There's nothing that happens where we go, oh, my God, that is leading to violence.  And when somebody suggests it, like they call it a climate of hate when you do jokes like  that, it's ridiculous.  Well, it might seem hacky.  All right.  Well, comedy is one thing, but it might, and it might seem hacky.  But, you know, when Hitler and Goebbels were talking about the Jews and how awful they 
[00:26:00]  were for Germany, those were words, those were speeches that were given that wound up  a people in a way that they were able to have the capacity to murder a lot of people.  Yeah.  With fucking words.  It was...  What did they murder the way?  Guns. 
[00:26:30]  But it's...  It just goes...  It's not as innocent.  Freedom of speech is always defended by everybody.  A lot of people say, hey, I got my freedom of speech to say that.  That's not defended by everybody.  Well, all right.  I understand what you mean.  It really isn't.  People have their own idea of it.  They have their own idea of it, but it doesn't get shit on like the Second does.  The Second Amendment gets shit on and picked apart.  I don't think the Second Amendment gets shit on if there's 330 million guns in the country. 
[00:27:00]  How is it getting shit on?  Think about it.  There's one gun per person.  How is the Second Amendment being shit on?  And I watched that speech.  I'm telling you...  The restrictions.  He made...  They made their argument terrible.  Like...  I won't even argue with that.  But I mean, that was the guy.  And that was a chance for them to seem reasonable.  And you know what?  After another school massacre, he misread the temperature of the country and how fucking fed up people were. 
[00:27:30]  That should have been a different speech.  It should have been a much different speech.  We've heard that speech over the years.  It was self-serving.  After tragedies.  And by the way, yes.  And it was so obvious that they should have taken a different tact.  They could believe all that, and that's fine.  But man, to push that agenda out as they did at that time was crazy on their part.  It didn't help their cause.  I understand what you're saying.  There are 300 million guns in this country.  But here's my point about how the second is picked apart.  In Times Square, they got the black Israelites. 
[00:28:00]  They spew hatred out there and with impunity.  No one fucks with them.  Obviously.  They're clowns.  But it's hate speech that they are spewing in public.  But most people that are hanging around, they kind of laugh at it.  But it doesn't matter.  The point is their First Amendment right is not being infringed upon.  They were able to stand there and talk.  Let me go out with Jimmy Norton into Times Square.  I will hand you a pistol.  You will go to jail for two years.  That's what I'm talking about, the Second Amendment right being infringed upon.  And if one of those guys used that speech, like if somebody was being assaulted and they were all standing there rooting on that assault and encouraging people to commit that murder, they would go to jail too. 
[00:28:30]  What they're saying is despicable.  Right.  But it's not – they're not inciting people to riot.  Right.  But I'm using the gun argument saying that – I'm not saying you're shooting people when I hand you a gun.  You're just standing there with a gun, which should be legal, yet you will go to prison for at least two years just for that fact.  For brandishing it. 
[00:29:00]  Just for having it.  You could even have it concealed.  If you own – if you have one without a permit and it's concealed, but for some reason you're stopped and frisked and they find out, you will go to jail for two years.  How is that not picking apart our Second Amendment right?  How many guns do you own?  About.  I probably have 50.  And how many do you think they'll take away?  I would assume they could take –  In the next 10 years, how many do you think they'll take away out of 50?  Most of my rifles I think they would take away. 
[00:29:30]  Like some of my pistols.  You really think they're going to take them away?  They are – Opie, they're talking.  I'm just asking.  It's a question.  But they are – see, the thing is no one's really as deep into this as I am.  They are literally talking about confiscation, not just banning weapons and then you keep the ones we got now.  We just won't sell them anymore.  Confiscation.  There is something going into a budget so they will literally have to buy back your weapons and then destroy them.  But the government will say, well, that gun is worth this much. 
[00:30:00]  Here's your money.  We're taking your gun.  They're talking about this.  This isn't something that I'm pulling out my ass.  I know, but the amount of lawsuits that they would have –  They're already saying there's going to be a whole bunch of lawsuits.  And the government can't fucking be tied up in court while they do this?  Well, the government does a lot of talking.  We all know that.  Well, you know what?  They said this past Congress, the 112th was the worst Congress ever.  Again, a perfect storm.  They got the least amount done ever.  We got a perfect storm.  And they said the 113th Congress is off to just to say if they should start. 
[00:30:30]  Liberal president in there.  We got people that are all riled up about Sandy Hook.  It's the perfect storm of what they need to start taking people's guns.  And that will make a giant problem.  Yeah, I agree.  It would be a big problem.  Yes.  I don't think it will happen because, again, there's just – first of all, the temperature – the vibe in Washington changes too quickly every four years.  But this is on the fast track. 
[00:31:00]  They're crazy with this.  Obama's talking about legislation before the end of January.  Why don't we do the second half of the Cuomo's speech from yesterday?  We have a seven-point agenda.  Number one, enact the toughest assault weapon ban in the nation, period.  You're number two against fucking California right now.  Number two, close the private sale loophole by requiring federal background checks.  Already have it, New York.  Number three, ban high-capacity magazines.  Already have it, New York. 
[00:31:30]  Number four, enact tougher penalties for illegal gun use, guns on school grounds, and violent gangs.  Number five, keep guns from people who are mentally ill.  Number six, ban direct Internet sales of ammunition in New York.  Oh.  Number seven, create a state next check on all ammunition purchases.  New York State led the way on guns once before. 
[00:32:00]  There was Sullivan's Law of 1911, which was the first in the nation gun control law, a model law that required a permit for possession of a handgun.  New York was the first.  It's still on the books.  New York led the way then.  Let's pass safe and fair legislation and lead the way once again in saving lives.  Saving lives, my ass.  It's more of a cultural problem than a hardware fucking problem.  You know how much of those 10,000 to 11,000 gun murders every year? 
[00:32:30]  First of all, I already said 8,000 of them are legitimate shootings by law enforcement and people protecting their own lives.  And the rest of them, 75% of them are fucking gangs, crime, inner city, where it's already illegal.  Chicago led the country in illegal gun shootings and deaths last year.  Led the nation over 500, something like 530 murders with guns. 
[00:33:00]  You're not allowed to have one.  So how does gun control work?  That's a litmus test.  Because obviously it's easy to get a gun.  Well, yeah.  And that won't stop.  Do you think if they ban guns, it won't start a black market gun importation?  Smart guns.  Like drugs and like fucking alcohol during Prohibition.  Guns will pour over the borders.  It will make a brand new mafia that happened during Prohibition.  They can't stop drugs.  They can't stop illegal aliens from going over the border. 
[00:33:30]  Guns.  There are people chomping at the bit, drooling, waiting for legislation like this to make their own fortunes by bringing illegal guns in because they're going to supply criminals with guns.  Guns, though, are metal.  They're a little easier to track.  No, they're not.  It's easy.  They're not metal?  No.  Not all of them.  But I'm talking about...  No.  What do you think?  The fucking...  The thing they transport drugs in are carbon fiber?  Yes.  They're boats.  They're planes.  They're fucking...  You can't swallow a gun and shit it out. 
[00:34:00]  I've tried.  They fucking...  You know, they use tunnels where they're bringing stuff in.  I mean, it...  Obviously, they're not going to get everything through, but just like drugs and just like alcohol back during Prohibition and everything else that's illegal, there's a market for it.  Let's see what...  We got the Jon Stewart clip as well that we referenced.  That cunt.  He's just liberal.  I mean, yeah.  Ugh.  I like Jon.  Yeah, he's a comedian.  Ugh.  He's just being silly.  Fuck him.  Well, it was too late.  Hitler took the guns.  Stalin took the guns. 
[00:34:30]  Mao took the guns.  Fidel Castro took the guns.  How many?  Hugo Chavez took the guns.  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.  Ah, yeah.  Laugh.  Laugh all the way to the fucking grave.  Holy s**t.  No one's taking away all the guns.  But now I get it.  Now I see what's happening.  So this is what it is.  Their paranoid fear of a possible dystopic future. 
[00:35:00]  Prevents us from addressing our actual dystopic present.  We can't even begin to address 30,000 gun deaths that are actually in reality happening in this country every year.  Because a few of us must remain vigilant against the rise of imaginary Hitler.  We'll be right back.  I'm sure there was somebody in the fucking 30s in Nazi Germany saying the same fucking thing. 
[00:35:30]  Same thing.  Oh, ooh, look out.  That guy's crazy.  Yeah.  Jon Stewart, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Weeping when the fucking World Trade Center towers fell.  Weeping.  Oh, look out my window.  I don't see the towers.  But I see the Statue of Liberty now.  And two years later, he's kissing Muslim asshole.  Fuck you, you self-hating Jew.  At least the funny's back.  Hey, Jon Stewart. 
[00:36:00]  Do you really?  Yes, he's an asshole.  Oh, he's so brilliant.  Oh, look.  He's making a face.  Oh, look.  He comes back from a clip and just stares at the camera all perplexed.  We get it.  You don't like his over-the-top delivery?  It's fun.  Ugh.  You don't like it?  Ugh.  I hate Jon Stewart.  Can't watch The Daily Show.  Love Colbert.  I don't watch The Daily Show, but I do like him.  And I'm not saying that because I'll be on it because I'll probably never be on it.  Fuck him running.  Is he a good stand-up?  Yeah, he was really good.  Fuck him running.  I don't think I ever saw him. 
[00:36:30]  No, I never saw him live.  Yeah, he's funny.  He's funny.  Enough of him.  You don't like the faces he makes when he comes back from clips?  Ugh.  No?  Another one who forgot about 9-11.  Oh, my God.  Enough of you.  What else is going on?  Anger's a drug.  Well.  You think he's addicted to anger all of a sudden?  What happened?  All of a sudden?  No.  He's been addicted to anger for a long time.  No, no, no.  I'm a happy guy.  18 and a half years, I would say maybe 15 of those not angry. 
[00:37:00]  I'm a happy guy.  No, you're a lot.  You're not a happy guy.  No, you're a lot.  Compared to who?  You weren't this angry guy for most of our existence.  No, I'm not as angry as you think.  I'm passionate about certain things.  That's true.  You know, I'm passionate about hypocrisy, especially in politics and in race.  Sure.  I'm very big on racial subject matter that people are dishonest about.  That makes you very angry. 
[00:37:30]  Very angry because no one wants to see it.  When you hold something up in front of someone's face and they don't see it, it's like, why  aren't you seeing this?  Believe me, I understand that frustration.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's very frustrating, but it's almost like, how can, it's like with Imus, we all  said, how can, remember you said, I start questioning myself, like, am I nuts to see this, the whole  country?  Sometimes people just don't see it that way.  And it's really frustrating and it's really annoying.  But the reality is sometimes people, like smart people, with race or with guns or with abortion, 
[00:38:00]  sometimes people just don't see it that way.  And that's, I don't get it because they don't see it my way.  Why not focus on the positive stories coming out of the black communities?  All right.  Pop one up there, Sam.  I set you up.  But there are.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are.  I'm sure there are.  A lot of black families trying to make an honest living.  Of course, I see them on commercials all the time.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  The mom, the dad, the kids, they're in front of us. 
[00:38:30]  There's one right now.  Sunshine day coming through the window, having breakfast together.  I've seen it.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  But it is happening.  There's some positive stuff going on out there.  Well, there's a grave problem with crime and violence in the black community.  That isn't being addressed honestly.  And when they quote statistics, they're quoting statistics of everybody and not concentrating 
[00:39:00]  on inner city problems.  And that's where the problem areas are.  And this crime rate and this murder rate would be a lot lower if the problems were addressed  and dealt with in the black community.  You know what?  That's what I say.  And I got to agree with you because now you're focusing on what drives me nuts, the fucking  media and how they stretch the truth.  Now, when you say 30,000 gun deaths a year, that is like, holy fuck.  But then when you do break down the numbers, you are absolutely fucking correct about that.  It's crazy.  Because they say it's about 75% inner city gun deaths. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, but all we have to do is get rid of the guns and I guess they'll stop killing  each other.  It's amazing.  Well, that means out of 30,000, what's 75% of 30?  Oh, come on.  Jesus.  About 20 maybe?  22?  It's about 2250-ish?  Yeah, 22 and a half.  I guess 22.  22 and a half?  Yeah.  So now you're talking to 30,000 gun deaths.  Now you're down to 7,500.  Yeah, 7,500 are not inner city related. 
[00:40:00]  That's not as impressive when you try to do your stories on gun control on the news.  Ah.  And that's where we're in the same fucking area.  That is true.  The difference with inner city, and there's a lot more murders there, and there's white  guy crimes and black guy crimes.  For some reason, walking in and shooting children purposefully is a white guy crime.  Absolutely.  That's not a black guy crime.  Absolutely.  And that's what people...  And that is way more horrendous to me than a stupid drive-by.  Well, it's certainly horrendous, and it's so rare. 
[00:40:30]  That's what's got people...  It is rare compared to how many people there are.  Do you know how many people have died in inner city gun violence since the Sandy Hook  shooting?  Do you even know?  A lot.  Probably eight.  It's an amazing amount of people that have been killed.  And children.  But how many?  Let me think.  And I know you're not that guy.  If it was...  I know you're not that guy.  I'm just trying to put a number around it.  How many about?  Just in Chicago alone...  Since Sandy Hook.  I'm going to say since Sandy Hook... 
[00:41:00]  I'm going to say probably 30 to 40 in just one inner city area.  That's it.  Which is...  And I'm talking women, children, innocent people.  These gangbangers, they don't fucking know how to aim.  We lost a 90-year-old woman.  90?  She bought it?  In New York.  I don't know if she died.  Oh, she didn't die?  I think she got shot in her elbow.  She was a victim of a drive-by?  A 90-year-old? 
[00:41:30]  Jesus.  You live your life and you got to take one to the elbow?  She got shot in the elbow because she was doing that shuffle-off to Buffalo elbow raise?  You think that fucked up her arthritis?  People have just had it and they don't know what to do.  That's all it is.  People have had it.  You know what?  Now I'm with you.  You're absolutely right.  People have had it and they just don't know what to do.  That is a great quote today.  Because I don't believe it's just as easy as taking away guns and shit.  No, I feel it's a combination of things. 
[00:42:00]  But I feel like I've had it too.  And I was really...  I hate how naive I can be.  I'm such an idealist.  I thought O.J. would get convicted.  I'm a dope.  And I really thought that when the NRA was going to make a speech that LaPierre was going  to say something that said, look, we are with you.  Yeah.  But you just want these guys...  I just hated his guts even more afterwards.  You want these guys to reach across the table, reach across the aisle, they say, right?  And just sit the fuck down and go, okay, we've all...  We all see this. 
[00:42:30]  We need to figure something out.  And it just never happens.  Never.  By the way, also...  And I'm not saying that means take the guns or this and that, but they don't even want  to fucking talk with each other.  I got a few numbers here that are interesting.  When you get someone like Jon Stewart that quotes a thing, out of 31,000 firearm deaths.  By the way...  This is 2007.  But people don't add the fact that I think it's over 100,000 people are injured by guns  every year, too.  Well, yeah, there's a lot of injuries.  A lot of those injuries are fucking brutal to live with, too. 
[00:43:00]  So, 17,000 of the 30,000, 17,000, over 17,000, suicides.  Suicides.  So, people that kill themselves.  Okay.  Wait, 17,000 out of the 31?  Out of the 31,000 are suicides.  So, now we're down to 14,000.  Are suicides.  So, that's 17,000 people that aren't harming anyone else.  It's 12,000 in 2007, and it's gone down since then to about 11,000.  So, 12,000 are homicide deaths, which means somebody killing somebody else intentionally 
[00:43:30]  or even accidentally.  It's 12,000.  And, again, I want to say a lot of those are cops.  A lot of them are legitimate self-defense shootings.  But when Jon Stewart says 30,000 killing, it makes it sound like people are running around  with assault weapons shooting people.  The fact of the matter is, rifles accounted for 350 of those shootings.  Out of 30,000?  31,000?  But that is their fucking, ah! 
[00:44:00]  Ah!  Whoa!  Get them off the street!  It's, it doesn't even add up.  It's just a drop in the bucket.  We all know that.  Doesn't mean anything.  But like Jimmy said, we're all fed up in just trying to figure out what the fuck we  could do.  People are fed up.  I think the mental illness problem is way...  It's a huge part of it.  Culturally, it's a huge part of it.  Way bigger than the stupid gun shit.  Yes.  Video games, very minuscule part of it.  I think so.  I think it's a part of it, but a minuscule part.  The media, a bigger part, but still a part.  I think the media, bigger than video games. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  But they don't want to acknowledge their faults.  But what you, what the, what certain, the NRA has done, I'm only using them because  they're kind of the mouthpiece.  I know, yeah, yeah.  Is they have said to people, we will not give an inch.  So people are like, okay, what can we do?  You, you're not going to meet with us, so we're going to take your shit.  It's almost like they had a chance there to, and they, and they should have not given  up their second amendment right, but they should have understood.  You really with us? 
[00:45:00]  Well, there is something about all those kids being murdered in a fucking school and it's  happened too many times.  We have had enough of this stuff and we, we don't think putting a guy with a gun there  is going to do it.  That's not the solution the country wants.  The NRA didn't read that.  That's their stance.  Okay.  So now the rest of the country is going, well, here's what we're going to try to do.  And that's how they drew their line in the sand.  People are responding to the line in the sand that was drawn by the NRA during the speech.  People need jobs in this country.  So having someone armed at every school in America, I, I would like to see that as a 
[00:45:30]  parent.  Like I'd bring my kid to a dumb little school program and it's just this kid that is watching  the front door.  I'm like, I don't fucking feel safe dropping my kid off here, especially after the Sandy Hook incident.  But if I knew there was like a, an off duty, uh, police officer with a gun, I would, I  would walk home with a much easier feeling until one of those guys.  And it would happen because the odds are that one of those guys would do something stupid  and murders fucking 10 children because his wife is, you know what I mean? 
[00:46:00]  It's like, you're never going to have a foolproof way of doing it.  It's always going to stop.  Our country likes to look at shit.  Everything has to be perfect.  You're right.  There's always going to be something.  It's not going to be perfect.  Right.  Hey, really fast.  Cause, uh, uh, the phones are lit.  We don't have to go to them, but I like to get a quick survey.  Yeah, it's fine.  Um, Mousy in Florida is the gun control thing.  The government doing their way taking.  Thanks.  Gun control thing.  The government is doing their, it's their way of taking over the people.  Yeah.  Well, Jesus.  All right.  Sorry.  I shouldn't have started with that one.  Uh, Jack says, I'm a liberal for the first time. 
[00:46:30]  I agree with Anthony.  Uh, Elias, uh, we need to enforce responsible gun ownership.  Dr. Show Elias.  Ryan, Virginia.  You want a walker?  Virginia Beach.  I'm a liberal and I completely agree with Anthony.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, Megan, just a quick survey here off our phones.  Why does Anthony think the second amendment is so sacred?  And Joe in Connecticut, Anthony, you are crazy about your gun shit.  All right.  You want to talk to Joe?  Why not?  That makes better radio.  Ah, sure.  All right.  Why not?  Go to that one.  Uh, Joe, what's up, buddy? 
[00:47:00]  Hi.  What's up, guys?  Good morning.  Hey.  I'm happy to hear Anthony's rant this morning, but Anthony, listen.  Yes.  I'm glad.  You know what?  I got to tell you, Joe, I'm glad he's finally speaking up on this issue because I've been  waiting for this day.  Yes, I've been silent about it.  Holy fuck.  Figured it's about time.  It's about fucking time.  I've been listening for a long time.  Anthony's fucking nuts.  That's besides the point.  The, uh, being in Connecticut, I know you guys look at it as 9-11 or whatever else,  but, uh, all this conspiracy bullshit and this libertarian stuff. 
[00:47:30]  It's not the liberties they're trying to take away.  They're trying to take the access to the guns away.  And I know you, you know, you have 50 guns in your house and a closet and all this stuff  and you'll polish them naked and all this stuff, but, you know, keep in mind, when you  have a kid in the house with Asperger's mental illness, there should be some kind of a legislation  where these guns are limited for parents that have children in the home with mental illness.  The multifaceted problem needs to be dealt with.  Let me ask you, let me ask you something though. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  Let me, let me ask you something about what you just said.  I understand that a parent needs to be responsible enough where they have a child with Asperger's  or any other kind of mental problems.  Those guns need to be locked up, completely locked up and safe.  And, and if the parent decides that they want to sacrifice any safety they would get from  guns, um, as opposed to the, uh, uh, not having safety because their child is a nut, they could  exercise that too by not having guns.  But it seems to me that having the state or the government jump in and tell you, you can't 
[00:48:30]  protect yourself because your son is crazy.  That is a weird thing too, because that opens up the door to say, well, we also don't like  maybe your income bracket and we're going to use that as, as a gauge to whether you can  own guns.  And I know that sounds ridiculous, but I'm just using a wide example here.  I don't think, I don't think guilt by association, I don't think guilt by association should be  used in, in, uh, prohibiting people from getting guns.  But I think the responsibility is so huge with gun ownership that if you have a mental 
[00:49:00]  case living in your house, yes, I think you should fucking think about not having a goddamn  gun.  But they're not going to.  But it's happened too many times.  But that's our freedoms.  No, I understand, but, but it's not as easy as that.  There's a lot of shitty fucking parents out there.  And then you add the fact that they're gun owners, legal gun owners with guns laying  around their house.  That's true.  And the shitty parents also raise people that rape and rob and do other things without  guns.  I understand that.  So what can we do to make that a little better?  You got, you got a shitty parent that is a quote, responsible gun owner, but the guns 
[00:49:30]  are laying around.  That's not responsible at all.  I know.  So what do we do?  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  So what do we do about that?  Because technically that person got their guns legally.  Yeah.  So what do we do?  I don't know.  I honestly, if you're caught with your stupid gun, but you can't have people just walking  through homes.  You're right.  To sit, to see if, uh, this, uh, this dopey parent is, uh, responsible with their guns.  Yep.  You're right.  I got no answer.  It's a fucked up problem.  I have no answer to that.  Smart guns.  We'll eventually have smart guns. 
[00:50:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  What do they do?  I love Jimmy's future.  They will never be called to the E-Rock.  Oh.  A smart gun will only be able to, I'll only be able to be fired by the proper owner.  And there'll be, I don't know why anybody thinks that's crazy.  Look where computers and technology are taking us.  It's very possible that they will, and of course people will fight it, but there will  be a way where certain guns can't be fired in certain areas or, um, only a licensed owner  can fire them or as you're firing them at right, you know, there's, there's going to 
[00:50:30]  be a way.  It would be nice if that technology was absolutely infallible.  It won't be infallible.  Every single time.  So you knew that if you had to use your gun and quickly pull it out where your fingers  don't have to be exactly on the right spot, you know, you, you're sloppy when you're  drawing a weapon.  You're not going to put your fingers on exact fingerprint things or something.  Well, it may not work that way.  It might not work that way, obviously, but the technology just isn't there for that right  now.  Um, whether it is in the future, then you have to consider, will that information be available  to, uh, law enforcement or, or the government that you now have this gun in your hand? 
[00:51:00]  Why were you, why did you have your gun?  You had your gun out.  We tracked it at six o'clock last night.  You were holding your gun.  Why?  Ah.  No, they won't ask why they'll know where it is.  Like, for instance, if you're in your house, you're in your house, or if you're at a gun  range or whatever, like, there will be no questions about it because it will, it'll  fall under the, uh, category of acceptable places to have your gun out.  That's kind of odd.  We're, we're sharing all information. 
[00:51:30]  We have to get used to that.  Everything, privacy is going away.  We have no choice in that, right?  It's all information.  Don't you think every car then should have something that you need to breathe into or have  a drunk sensor?  Yes, I do.  Every single one.  Yes.  Even in Jimmy Norton, who doesn't drink at all in his car, everyone has to do it.  I would say yes to it.  I'd be willing to deal with that.  Yeah.  I know that sounds horrible as far as what America, you know, was built on, but wouldn't  you love getting into your car?  Enough of these fucking assholes drunk driving into innocent people. 
[00:52:00]  Where you just blow into it.  Yeah, I would do that one.  I would do that one.  But then with, then I disagree with Jimmy with the easy pass thing where they can now  track you everywhere.  I don't like that.  I'm not doing anything wrong, but that feels weird to me.  I don't care if they can, because it's a voluntary thing.  It's almost like, you know, a case-by-case basis with me.  They can follow me anywhere because...  But the drunk driving thing, I fucking...  This is all just getting a little too sketchy.  Huh?  No, I know.  I know.  It's like this very, very intrusive.  I mean, for the sake of safety, we're getting intruded upon for this sake of safety where, 
[00:52:30]  in many cases, and I'm not mentioning the drunk driving thing, that's unbelievably high.  Hold on.  Before you move on from that.  Or make the highways safer.  Why are we still...  Foam rubber?  Why are we still driving 70 miles an hour toward a car going 70 miles an hour?  And you just trust this person that the mere five feet that separates you two is going  to be okay.  You just got to hope.  It fucking is scary as shit.  It really is.  You just assume every single car is paying attention. 
[00:53:00]  It's all free will.  As they zoom right by you.  That's all free will right there.  If that person decides they're just going to go, those fucking country roads where they're  coming at you 50, 50 miles an hour, a mere five feet away from you.  Or if you have a bad...  If you blow the tube and you're drunk, you won't...  Because people will be like, well, what if you need to move your car if you won't be  able to go over 10 miles an hour?  There will be a technology for that.  That could be even more dangerous, but I understand what you're saying.  But what is the answer?  But then someone else blows into your thing.  A workaround.  Yeah, sure, there's always going to be ways to get around it. 
[00:53:30]  But then if you're the guy blowing into that guy's thing, but the other guy was driving,  then you should be fucked, too.  Sure, because within the very near future, you will be able to blow into a tube, and whoever  blows into the tube, their DNA will be recorded.  You'll know who you are.  I don't know if I want more information.  I am being a hypocrite, but I mean, you know, a case-by-case basis on some of this shit.  I've lost a few fucking people to drunk driving, man.  Yeah, everyone has.  I don't think there's one person that doesn't know somebody.  It's amazing.  I'm special.  Yeah, the driver.  I'm just saying, and how many of those deaths a year?  It's an amazing number, yes. 
[00:54:00]  But we don't even, you know, we don't tackle that problem.  Right.  Is that a bigger problem in guns?  Well, we try to address it through education and everything else, but we never address it  by taking people's cars away or taking booze away.  Oh, my God.  It's the hypocrisy there.  It's because people would lose their fucking minds if you told them, so many people die  in traffic accidents related to alcohol, that we are going to start limiting cars.  We're going to start limiting the speed of cars.  We're going to start limiting things, you know, the hours you could drive, maybe. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know.  So, but people would lose their minds, and the same people that are pushing for gun control  would lose their minds because you're taking away one of their freedoms.  But there are plenty of restrictions on cars, too, like, you know, how fast you're allowed  to go.  There is a limit on how fast they can be on the street.  There's street legal.  So there are those things in place.  But that's up to the person, not the hardware.  Hold on.  Saving lives for 20 years, drunk driving.  So, in the last 20 years, drunk driving deaths have gone down.  We've got to get those up, people.  Come on.  In 1991, when this survey started, there were 15,627 deaths. 
[00:55:00]  Fast forward, we don't have to do every year, but we're down to 10,228, something like that,  in 2010.  That's just drunk driving.  So we've saved about 5,000.  That's gone down, you know, considerably.  Yeah, it's the third.  Third less.  Third, right?  33%.  Okay.  That's pretty amazing.  And what has changed?  A lot of safety features in cars.  I heard this story the other day.  Cars themselves have a lot of safety features in them that they didn't have back then. 
[00:55:30]  Let's get safety features in guns.  Guns.  Yeah, why not?  Foam bullets.  Foam bullets would be a good start.  Just a flag that comes out and goes, pow.  And then you've got to agree with the person that goes, well, I would have been dead.  Did I tell you what Rich and Bonnie gave my kid for Christmas?  Aw!  What?  You know, the Sandy Hook thing has just happened.  Yeah.  I'm a parent, so I think I'm maybe even more focused on it.  I don't know.  Sure.  The parents I talk to, it seems it hits even closer to home. 
[00:56:00]  They bring over like a semi-automatic fucking kid pistol.  It's a huge, it has a barrel on it like this.  What am I holding up?  Like the sides of-  My cock.  That was too easy.  But it's like, I don't know, the equivalent of like three water bottles put together.  Like a coffee can.  As I said, yeah.  And it's heavy and it's, I'm like-  Thick.  A gun.  And it's a-  That's very presumptuous to get a child a gun.  Some parents would love it, but others don't. 
[00:56:30]  You can't just do that like, think it's going to be okay.  I'm not one of those parents, I don't want my kid playing with, you know, fake guns.  But it just fucking creeped me out.  Well, they're terrible people.  It got, it was just creepy.  And even Rich was like, what the-  Because I guess Bonnie bought it?  But he's pretty thinking.  Where you going?  Plus it's for five-year-olds and up.  He's two and a half.  I don't think he can lift the thing even.  Oh, man.  But it just felt weird and wrong, man.  Huh.  That's, well, and that's up to the parent too. 
[00:57:00]  If a parent doesn't want their kids playing with gun toys, that's fine.  To bring over one does seem a little odd because it is such a personal issue with your kids.  I don't care if he plays all the games we did growing up, you know.  I don't care if he's got the fake guns and all that shit.  Yeah.  I really don't.  But it just felt weird.  Yeah.  It was too close to the whole incident and everyone's talking about this shit.  I don't even want to talk to her or anything, but I know Megan said, why does Anthony think the Second Amendment is so sacred?  She's a regular, man.  You like her?  She has that nice voice.  I think she has nice boobies. 
[00:57:30]  I just, I'm persistent with the discussion.  But the fact of the matter is, it's because, it's like your house.  Like, your house, when you sleep at night, you lock your doors, you go to bed, and you're protected.  You feel protected from any outside influence that's walking around.  It's sacred to me because I see that as a type of protection that is there for self-defense against, yeah, just against regular thug.  And it does happen. 
[00:58:00]  I'm not paranoid.  People do get assaulted.  People do get killed, raped, whatever.  But it's also the bigger picture of, I'm in my home.  I'm here in this country.  There is a government in place.  And it's not out of the realm of possibility throughout world history that perfectly fine governments have turned around and enacted their will on the people.  And the first thing they do is take people's guns away.  It's happened so many times that you can't just pawn that off as being paranoid or crazy.  You're right. 
[00:58:30]  So it's a security in our way of life.  The Second Amendment is that.  It's our house, our sanctity and safety in this way of life we have.  You're allowed to own as many guns as you want.  All right.  And any type of gun you want.  President Opie.  But.  I'm in.  What?  Uh-oh.  Can't leave your house with them.  Oh, man.  No one can leave their house.  Oh, I don't like that.  I would feel extremely safe in my house.  Could you see somebody from the fucking Bloods saying like, damn, I can't leave my house with my gun. 
[00:59:00]  God damn.  No, man.  They passed that shit.  You got to leave your gun in the shoebox.  Oh, man.  By the way, I agree with you on the Second Amendment.  But the issue.  It is sacred.  But the issue people have with it is when fucking dickheads like Wayne LaPierre stand up there and doesn't want to give an inch.  And then the rest of the country goes, fuck you.  Believe me, you're right.  I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.  I support the NRA.  I support what they stand for.  But I was literally embarrassed watching him speak.  He's not that guy. 
[00:59:30]  But he's speaking for them.  I know.  It was terrible.  I was sitting there cringing.  What did your fellow NRA members think of his speech?  They didn't like it either.  Yeah.  Very lackluster.  If he gave a fucking amazing speech, it would have been all over the place.  There would have been a lot of message boards and chat rooms about the NRA that would have said, wow, now that was good.  But everybody was just kind of like, huh, yeah.  He was in a tough spot, obviously.  But he probably should have had some advisors around him.  He's not that guy.  To get the feel of what the vibe of the country was.  He needs a speaker. 
[01:00:00]  He needs somebody.  He could be the – he might be a great guy logistically or something like that.  But he might need a speaker.  Somebody that is very good at presenting their point of view.  I didn't like his message.  I didn't even – not even just him.  I didn't like the message he gave because it was unbending.  And at a time like this, when something like that happened, nobody wanted to hear an unbending speech from the NRA.  I wouldn't mind a bending speech if the fact is you weren't speaking to alligators and telling them, look, I'm going to put my foot down here. 
[01:00:30]  Don't bite me.  No.  It's one of those things.  You can't bend with what people are trying to do to your rights.  You can compromise.  I understand that.  And they have compromised on things like background checks and a lot of issues.  But the fact – why wouldn't they just be for that?  Like the unreasonableness of people not being for – for anyone to say I don't understand a background check when it comes to buying a gun.  And I can't have any type of fucking discussion with that person. 
[01:01:00]  I think the thought process behind that is very old and very –  Slippery slope shit.  It's slippery slope stuff.  And it's also the fact that a lot of these purists with the Second Amendment don't want the same people that you would be defending yourself against in the case of a governmental tyranny to have the information that you own this gun.  And how many people own these guns?  You don't want the enemy, which they would be, knowing how many guns you have and which guns they are.  Well, then that person – I don't support them in their view of what the Second Amendment is. 
[01:01:30]  Well, that's the view.  I know.  Obviously, it runs the spectrum of the purists who think that you should be able to own anything and the people that are responsible and willing to bend and compromise on gun control issues.  There are a lot of people in between there.  LaPierre is more from that other mindset.  Of course he is.  And unfortunately, he really made the NRA look bad.  Well, we're not going to solve this issue today.  I thought we were.  Biden's going to meet with the NRA today, so that'll be very interesting. 
[01:02:00]  As he talks about executive privilege from fucking Obama.  The fact that they're talking executive privilege and the fact that my fucking name is on a published list that went out is a little –  You know, look, again, I'm not a crazy parent.  You could be on a many lists at this point.  Well, there are a few that keep children from knocking on my door on Halloween.  Not that list, right?  No.  You might want to tell the people which list.  I've skirted from that list.  There's worse list to be on.  Hey, when we get back, we're going to talk about lions and orangutans. 
[01:02:30]  Oh!  Yeah, we're going to change things up.  That's right.  Where's my bell?  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Welcome to Should I Suck a Dick or Not?  The show where nationally known comedians meet our panel and try to decide, should I suck a dick or not?  Today's guest, Joe DeRosa.  I do a bit about this, about like the stair step up to it. 
[01:03:00]  It's like it's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  I might be fucking all in.  I might want to go all the way.  Here's the thing.  Now, what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know.  That's what he hasn't really answered.  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz, but that's the thing.  Why are you making these rules?  Warranties rules.  Warranties rules.  Warranties rules.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I've had my own jizz on my face.  What's the difference?  It's another man's. 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  It looks like Joe DeRosa is going to suck dick.  That's all the time we have this week.  Tune in next time when Ricky Gervais tries to decide.  That's not only a dick.  That's the biggest dick in the world.  Should I suck a dick or not?  Time is running out.  Tick tock.  The American middle class is shrinking every day.  You know, the people that are hard pressed, we have to help bring them up. 
[01:04:00]  These economic challenges call for strong leadership, but not everyone agrees.  Some people are starting to go like, hmm, does this guy know what the fuck he's doing?  Senator Nagel says Anthony Cumia is the Antichrist.  Of course.  Chairman Teff says Cumia will destroy us all.  Nope.  Chief Justice Roberts proclaims Cumia will wipe his ass with the Constitution.  Enough already.  Wise, benevolent, and even-tempered, Anthony Cumia has the solution to our nation's economic crisis. 
[01:04:30]  Just tax the shit out of everybody.  Liberal-minded philanthropist Anthony Cumia will restore balance to our nation.  It is like the old communist method of everybody gets a piece of the pie.  Say no to discretionary income.  Say yes to a mountain of costly social services.  This fall, vote for Anthony Cumia.  That's what I am.  Tax and spend Democrat.  You got it.  Paid for by the United Negro College Fund in cooperation with the NAACP.  Yay! 
[01:05:00]  Series XM.  This is the Opinetry Show.  Show, show, show.  Hot legs!  We got Rod Stewart shit today.  Oh.  68 years old.  Oh.  You're not a Rod Stewart fan?  No.  I just like you and think I'm sexy.  Uh.  Yeah, I was never a big Rod Stewart fan.  I hate-  He redoes We're Having a Party and it makes me sick to my stomach. 
[01:05:30]  Like he was sick to his stomach from drinking jizz?  No, that's what made him feel better.  Oh.  That's funny.  That was an elixir.  An elixir.  You don't like the Maggie Mae?  I like the Maggie Mae.  That's okay.  Yeah, Maggie Mae.  I'm trying to see if I like anything else, really.  I'm knocking on my door.  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.  This is a racist. 
[01:06:00]  What about, do you think I'm sexy?  I do.  Oh.  Yeah.  This is not a bad song.  That's okay.  It's kind of down and dirty.  There's a tweet that reminds me of The Godfather.  Yeah.  Because don't compare the First and Second Amendments.  Words don't kill people.  Now who's being naive, Kay?  Politicians don't kill people.  Senators and presidents don't have men killed.  Don't have men killed. 
[01:06:30]  Stupid Kay.  Kay's so dumb.  Think she was dumb?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dumb coat hanger.  We got some Donald Trump stuff.  We got some Lions shit.  We got some Catherine Webb shit.  And maybe Mayor Menino babbling.  I sure want to hear that if he is indeed babbling.  As long as we don't poke fun at him.  Yeah.  We're good natured.  We're up to day three of the Catherine Webb thing.  Maybe day four because it started Monday night.  I like her, by the way.  Catherine Webb is the girlfriend of the Alabama quarterback. 
[01:07:00]  And TMZ is now reporting that the Alabama quarterback is very jealous of the attention  he's getting.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Just like we said.  That was probably his best kept secret.  Like, all right, the team knows.  My family and stuff.  But he won a national title and no one cares.  No one cares.  And no one cares.  The fuck about him.  Unless, of course, you're an Alabama fan.  But the rest of the...  At this point, because it's world media.  The whole world is fixated on his girlfriend.  Yep.  Catherine Webb.  And she even said, oh, there's a clip. 
[01:07:30]  Is that her?  No, it's Britney.  Her quote.  Oh, that's Britney with dark hair.  Holy fuck.  Because she didn't think that they...  She didn't feel Brett Musburger said anything inappropriate.  No.  She was very nice about it.  And Brett Musburger didn't say anything inappropriate.  No, he didn't.  No.  Especially for a sports fucking network.  You know what the really weird thing is?  No one is or was outraged at what was said.  They apologized before anyone even said there was a problem.  Well, they must have got wind that someone was bothered.  No.  No.  I don't think anyone said anything.  I'm with Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  Nowadays, they don't even get wind.  No.  They quickly go, we need to apologize.  And what that does is make Brent Musburger look like a complete creepy old man.  Right.  Makes him look like an asshole.  They hung him out to dry.  And like we learned yesterday, he's been a sports broadcaster since 1968.  Yep.  And he has to deal with this shit.  Amazing.  She said, let's focus on the team, though.  She did say that in one of her...  Well, you know why.  Of course, he's been sulking around.  His dick probably hasn't worked in three days.  Oh, my God.  You think he's all soft?  It's a limp noodle.  Can't get a rod.  She's trying to suck it.  He's like, come on, big shot.  Get it hard. 
[01:08:30]  You know, every single one of us that is on Twitter, you know, checks our followers.  And you want to see those numbers go up.  Yeah.  Imagine him.  He's like, what the fuck is it going to take?  I just won the national title.  Oh, my chick.  And they show my chick on TV for what?  I think they...  Do they keep going back to her?  I don't even know because I did not watch.  She fucking...  And now she's got NFL guys coming on to her.  Fucking Kobe asshole Brian.  You've got Kobe.  He's trying.  Kobe Bryant actually, if it's true, he invited her to a Lakers game. 
[01:09:00]  What a...  But he's back with his wife, though.  He's like...  You sure?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they were seen out together.  Then what the fuck was that about?  Maybe just because she's a big, you know, whatever.  That's what you want to do.  Get a nice fucking white girl like that and have her go out with a fucking rapist.  Well, you know, it's still a good player.  Jesus.  Holy shit, man.  Great player, actually.  Come on.  Here's the latest on Catherine Webb.  Now that you've heard what was said about you by Brent Musburger and the others... 
[01:09:30]  Oh, no.  Not Matt Lauer.  The Matt Lauer interview.  Yuck.  He stinks.  You're going to hate Jon Stewart all you want.  I fucking hate Matt Lauer.  Yeah, he is terrible.  They're going to move on from him sooner than later.  His time is done.  Now that you've heard what was said about you by Brent Musburger and the others on the air,  how do you feel about it?  I know you said you don't take offense to it, but they did go on and on about your appearance 
[01:10:00]  in it.  What a fucking dick.  Yeah.  You're trying to make something.  They all do this.  She meant it.  She meant it.  She wasn't bothered by it.  So how about you try another question?  She's a beauty queen, you dumb fuck.  Yeah.  Right.  Of course she's not bothered when people say she's beautiful.  That's annoying that he's taking that angle.  That is irritating.  She lives in a world where she makes, that's her business, and she wants people to think  she's beautiful.  She's pretty.  On and on about your appearance and how young guys in Alabama should toss the football around 
[01:10:30]  so they get to date a girl like you.  With a little hindsight, how do you feel about the comments?  You know, I think the media has been really unfair to him.  I think that if he would have said something of, belongs the line of, that we were hot or  sexy or made any derogatory statements like that, I think that would have been a little  bit different.  But the fact that he said that we were beautiful and gorgeous, I don't see why any woman wouldn't  be flattered by that.  So I think that they've been a little bit unfair to him.  And so I don't think he's a mystery at all. 
[01:11:00]  So no reason for ESPN to apologize, in your opinion?  You know, I don't think it was needed, honestly.  I mean, of course, I appreciate it.  Keep trying, Matt.  Keep trying.  But at the same time, I don't think that I needed an apology.  Keep trying to trip her up.  If he had called you a fucking whore, would you then have been upset?  Like, just keep digging.  They don't like when you give a nice answer.  They just can't fucking handle it when you give a nice answer.  Brent Musburger was very respectable.  And using the word beautiful, yeah, that's different.  Right.  She's beautiful.  What are you going to say?  If he said hot and all that, I still think it should be okay. 
[01:11:30]  But he was very careful.  I'd shoot through a mile of her shit to get to her.  Well, it ain't like he said a half mile.  He did say a full mile.  A full mile of shit.  Brent Musburger is a legend.  And now he has to deal with this horse shit because this stupid company wouldn't back  him up and go, look, there's nothing here.  Got any Musburgers back there?  I'm starving.  Right?  Yes.  How about the company, for one, sticks up for their talent?  They never do.  ESPN is vomit-inducing. 
[01:12:00]  Theemptive apology is ridiculous.  I'm sure there was probably some shitty, very hard-left, liberal woman's rights website  that probably blogged something.  But, I mean, yeah, maybe.  I heard nothing.  But fuck those people.  I didn't even hear Gloria fucking Steinem come out and say anything.  Steinem?  She's dead.  Whatever.  She's dead, right?  All red.  Gloria all red.  Gloria Steinem died, didn't die?  She's dead, right?  No, she's not.  Right?  Steinem?  I would know.  I would know. 
[01:12:30]  Give me the picture, and I'll tell you she's dead enough.  She's not dead.  When I see their pictures, I know.  Yeah, Gloria all red.  Yeah, Gloria all red didn't even say anything.  And she's the fucking...  Oh, that's Steinem.  No, she's alive.  Which one's dead?  I just needed to see the picture.  It's the other one.  Gloria Stivik?  Nah, the other one.  The, uh, the, uh, the, uh...  Gloria...  Ah, fuck.  Gloria...  Estefan?  Estefan.  Gloria...  Maybe it's not even...  It might not even be a Gloria.  Oh!  Bunker?  But it's in that same world.  Bunker?  That same world. 
[01:13:00]  She looked like a corpse when she was walking around.  Gloria Hull?  Uh, help me out.  Gloria Gaynor?  Gloria Gaynor?  Gloria...  I will survive?  Gloria!  Gloria!  You got me by the short hairs!  Uh, what?  I don't know.  Ah, whatever.  It'll...  It doesn't matter.  Um, Sam, what is TMZ saying?  About the, uh, the boyfriend?  He's very upset.  Look.  I quit, y'all.  Britney Teff...  Oh, she's out? 
[01:13:30]  She's quitting?  They're pissed, you know.  Yeah.  See, I know a little bit about pop culture.  Why is she quitting?  Dish, Opie, dish!  Well, it turns out that the X Factor...  Sam's gonna back me up.  I know he is.  Oh, another gossipy...  They wanted the crazy Britney Spears.  They did not get the crazy Britney Spears.  So, actually, they're moving on from Britney Spears, but gave her the opportunity to quit  before they moved on to the judges.  They wanted batshit Britney.  They wound up getting...  It's the only reason they fucking hired for the show.  Like, shaved the head, crazy Britney.  And they got weird Britney with the weird faces. 
[01:14:00]  But not over the top, Chris.  Barely.  I mean...  The montages of her making faces, it's all over YouTube, is really funny.  Was she cunti or was she...  No, she was horrible.  No, she was just really strange.  I think Aguilera was a cunt, I hear.  She's a wordo.  Yeah, they're moving on from Aguilera, right?  Are they?  I don't know about that.  Yeah, they got new judges, and then they're gonna...  It's just for this season.  That's what they're saying.  But they're not committing to bringing in Aguilera back.  Aguilera's on what?  The Voice.  The Voice, which is like the...  That's the go-to talent show right now. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah, it is.  But what about Catherine Webb's boyfriend, AJ McCarron?  Well, they're saying Catherine Webb is going off the grid.  Like, she's not doing interviews and stuff anymore.  Catherine TMZ is saying it's because her boyfriend doesn't want her to.  But she's saying...  That relationship's doomed.  The decision is all hers, because she wants the attention to be on AJ and his accomplishments.  AJ, yeah, he's a little insecure, and the relationship is now doomed. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, that's done.  It's doomed.  They couldn't take that.  And we're seers here on the O.P. & Anthony show.  I'll give it a couple months, and there'll be a little article.  There'll be a little thing on the news.  Not on the front page anymore, but it'll be a little further in the paper, and it says that they broke up.  No, it'll probably be on the news, like in one of the entertainment things.  They'll go like, hey, remember the football player's girl?  And they'll have to think for a second.  No, actually, she's going to become a star.  Supposedly, she's going to be on the next Celebrity Apprentice already.  Oh, my God.  And he won a national team. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, nothing.  It doesn't get much bigger than that in sports.  He's going to be sitting at his hometown bar talking about his glory days of football while she's on national television.  Their relationships are doomed.  They're done-ski.  Yeah, she'll move on to somebody else who can handle it like a comedian.  Oh, maybe Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Duggan wants it badly.  Duggan.  Duggan.  Duggan!  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, sweetie.  Hey, man. 
[01:16:00]  That corpse of a woman, O.B., you were trying to think of, was Bella Abzug.  Bella Abzug!  Where are you going back a few years, aren't you?  She could eat my balls.  Bella Abzug and her dumb hats.  I remember Bella Abzug.  Bella Abzug.  But that would not be the answer for today.  No, sir.  Give me a picture of Bella Abzug.  Ah, Bella.  Yeah, but now you've got that image burned in your head.  I do, you fucking asshole.  Yeah, Bella Abzug is terrible. 
[01:16:30]  What was she?  She was a big fucking, I don't know, women's rights brother.  I don't know who Bella Abzug is.  Yeah, you know.  Look at her picture.  She's got all them hats.  She looks like, what's her name from, it's a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad,  mad, mad, mad world.  She was known for, yeah, in your face, kind of very women's lib.  She never took any shit from nobody.  No guff.  I like Google imaging these really ugly broads to see if they ever were pretty.  Yeah.  You think Bella Abzug ever, uh, Oh, Bella. 
[01:17:00]  You think that was, Oh, Bella.  And she wore those wacky hats right to the end.  Look.  That was her thing.  That was her fucking gimmick.  She needed to wear the wacky hats.  Why?  What was up?  I don't know.  She always had that gimmick.  Did she have a bald spot up there?  Maybe.  That was back in the days of like, what, was it Koch?  Probably, yeah.  Mayor Koch and Bella Abzug, very gritty city thing.  That's some Koch shit.  But yeah, Bella Abzug ran for mayor.  Congress Roman.  Congress.  Congresswoman Bella Abzug. 
[01:17:30]  But she ran for mayor too.  She wanted to be mer.  I don't think she got that.  Mayor.  We would know that now, right?  She never was mayor.  Yes.  No.  I know.  No.  Look at her with her stupid hat.  Yeah.  It's like Dennis Eckersley.  It's like enough with the stupid mustache.  Wow.  You don't have a screen today?  No.  Why do these guys have to?  They were famous looking one way, so then they have to keep it like that for the rest of their  lives.  Exactly.  Eckersley looks like a complete asshole with a stupid mustache and the same haircut from  the fucking 80s. 
[01:18:00]  Does he have the same hair?  The exact.  Give me the Dennis Eckersley now.  He's the go-to one where they refuse to change.  Who did we meet recently that refused?  Was it Goose Gossage had the same?  I never met Goose.  Oh, did Goose have the same?  Where did you meet Goose Gossage?  Oh, was it Raleigh Fingers?  Didn't he come to your signing?  Raleigh Fingers?  No, no.  Sparky Lyle.  Sparky Lyle?  He was doing a signing.  He just came over and said hello.  Yeah, look at Dennis Eckersley refuses to shave his mustache. 
[01:18:30]  Because he was...  And the only reason is some guys will refuse to shave their mustache because, you know,  they feel that's how it is.  That's their look.  All right.  But with him, I know it's because that's how he was famous and he wants to keep looking  the exact same way he did.  Keith Hernandez finally shaved his.  He did?  Yeah.  He actually wanted to shave it, but he was doing those Just for Men commercials.  And it was in his deal that he couldn't shave his mustache until he was out of that contract.  So he stopped doing the Just for Men commercials and shaved it for some kind of charity, I think.  You know, speaking of baseball.  Wow.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:00]  You know what?  Fuck Major League Baseball and fuck the Hall of Fame.  Yeah, that's amazing.  Stop making believe you had do-gooders.  Yeah.  Everyone was cheating throughout the history of baseball.  You're trying to tell me that Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, who else was in there?  Roger Clemens.  Roger Clemens, of course, and then Biggio, right?  Because Sosa says so.  Biggio, and then Mike Piazza, which would be kind of on the fence, I think, with his stats. 
[01:19:30]  No one gets into the Hall of Fame this year.  It's very rare that they do this.  It's amazing.  Never.  I think it's the first time ever.  Why?  Are you sure about that?  No.  What's that?  Oh, 96, I'm sorry.  Yeah, every once in a while they do this, but it's very rare.  So it's been 16, 17 years since the last time they did this, where they say no one's going in.  But it was supposed to be the big year, because you have Clemens, Barry Bonds, and Mark McGuire all eligible.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  This is where baseball is fucking up.  Their sport was, everyone hated baseball in, like, 94.  It was brought back by fucking Sosa and McGuire, these two juice heads, hitting the ball like a couple of retards over the fence. 
[01:20:00]  That is what brought your fucking sport back after the strike.  And we all had to make believe that they weren't on anything.  When they were hitting 70 homers out of nowhere, even the sports writers who vote on this shit, they're not dumb. 
[01:20:30]  They all knew that those guys were juicing in that era.  Everybody knew.  The guy bunted the ball over the fence.  Right.  But let's now all have morals.  When the sports writers knew, all the players knew, management knew, the owners knew, the commissioner knew, they all knew something was up.  Yes, and baseball, again, there has always been a shitty dark side to baseball.  Oh, tell me about it.  What year did they start that?  I guess it's, oh, Ant.  I guess it's when you get caught. 
[01:21:00]  They go, well, that was the climate back then.  Like, people say, well, a lot of these players didn't have to face black players.  So should they, especially the pitchers, should those pitchers' stats count for as much?  Well, that was the time.  Well, this is the time.  That was the time.  There was always people looking for that fucking thing to give them the edge.  Always.  Are you going to tell me Ty Cobb would have done steroids?  Of course he would have.  Of course he would have.  He would sharpen his cleats, which was technically not illegal, but he would try to stick them in people, that is.  Pete Rose looks like a choir boy at this time, right, guys? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Right?  I used to love watching that fucking McGuire.  Of course.  It was crazy.  The 2-2 pitch.  Crack!  Just fucking, and the crowds would love it.  It was fucking great!  At the end of his run there, he looked like a monster when he came up.  It was a cartoon character.  And we're all going to make believe that that was fucking healthy living?  Oh, sure.  Get the fuck out of here.  Just bumbling like morons around there.  You're going the wrong way.  That's the old.  Okey-dokey! 
[01:22:00]  Fucking idiots.  Didn't matter.  He could walk around those bases.  Absolutely.  And who votes in the hall?  Sportswriters and who else?  Sportswriters.  So they all are outraged now when they saw Barry Bonds' head get twice.  Twice the size within his career.  But wasn't he great before that?  Yeah, they all were pretty good before that.  How about Chief Nakahoma?  He should be in the hall.  Show me...  You saw fucking McGuire's arms?  Show me Mark McGuire beginning of his career and near the end.  Right.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Of course he was on something. 
[01:22:30]  And everyone knew it.  Hey, he just found a good workout regimen.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  Sure.  Vitamins.  That's it.  Maybe he was doing the Hulk Hogan thing.  Maybe it was kettlebell die for him.  Oh, ha, ha.  Now, you would swear the kid on the left is in some...  And I'm saying kid was in a Little League program wearing an A's uniform.  But no, that's Mark McGuire at the beginning of his career.  That looks like you and your Kinnison picture.  There you go.  And then look at the fucking shot. 
[01:23:00]  That's only 10, 12 years later.  It's a ham.  Look at his forearms in that first picture, though.  He was a big guy to begin with.  He had some big fucking arms, but he didn't have big shoulders.  Look at that.  That's true.  He is a monster.  And his biceps are probably as big as my thigh.  Crazy.  Massive.  Juicy.  Crazy.  Massive.  And then when he got off it, when he retired and had to speak in front of Congress.  With his little old lady glasses.  He had little glasses, and he's like, well, let me tell you.  And he just looked frail. 
[01:23:30]  Look, you know, he was always meaty.  Now we're looking at another picture when he was on the A's and then, of course, the Cardinals.  Hey, look, I'm playing for Oakland.  Don't he look like Regan?  You can tell he has, like, meaty arms and stuff, but they're not defined.  And then in the picture on the right, he's a monster.  No neck at all.  He's a superhero.  He is a superhero.  He should have a cape, yes.  If he was in a Batman movie, you would believe him as some kind of villain or superhero.  Look at those fucking four arms. 
[01:24:00]  Come on.  Of course.  He was a bodybuilder at that point.  It was fucking great.  I'm amazed he was able to get the bat still around.  Because it still takes skills to hit that fucking thing.  It just means when you do hit it, it's going to go a lot further.  Oh, it's going to fucking go.  You've still got to figure that eye-hand coordination.  They say it improves your eyesight, too, though.  It does.  It does, right?  I never heard that before, Jim.  Yeah, I've heard that.  That it makes you focus better or whatever.  What about the LASIK surgery?  That made people see the size of his arms.  You know what?  That's true.  That's his arms. 
[01:24:30]  Look at those fucking things.  The sports writers should be ashamed.  Right.  Because they all knew.  They all knew something was up.  Yeah.  They probably knew more than something was up.  Fucking funny, man.  They probably helped half these fucking guys put a needle in their ass.  Yeah.  Could you fucking stick me in the ass?  But for the first time in a while, nobody's going into the Hall of Fame when you had a  lot of guys that certainly would have been in first ballot easily.  Poor Sammy Sosa. 
[01:25:00]  Watch this face with bleach.  That Sammy Sosa?  Happened.  On the right?  Yeah.  You could do this at home, obviously.  They have the side-by-side pictures of all these guys.  Play your log at home.  What is the other one?  Yeah, show Barry Bonds.  That one is the funniest one, because it looks like Mark McGuire, like you said, had some  bulk to him always.  Yeah.  But Barry Bonds was a skinny, skinny dude when he started.  Yeah.  He became a monster's giant head. 
[01:25:30]  Crazy.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Look at that, Jimmy.  It looks like a Somali pirate.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  If someone told you that guy on the pirate, if someone told you the guy on the left right  there was going to be the home-run king someday, you would laugh.  He looks like his own son in that picture.  Right.  And then the guy on the right is the Barry Bonds on the steroids.  Yeah.  Many would say.  That big beluga whale head.  Massive head.  His head is almost twice the size. 
[01:26:00]  The sonar in that forehead.  Look, and that's him on the left when he was with the pirates.  You could tell he was lifting some weights, but you just don't get the bulk or the definition.  No.  But you could tell he absolutely was in the weight room a lot.  Yeah.  The guy on the right is so much wider.  But to put it over the top, you've got to take the juice.  Yes, as well as the Christians.  I don't know if this is going to be good, but Menino is talking about the flu in Boston, 
[01:26:30]  and we love Menino.  His tongue did the steroids.  You can see early pictures.  It's very small.  Whoa.  What is that?  A big fucking cock on that man.  That's my picture.  Who's that?  I don't know.  Why do you have that picture as your screensaver?  They're trying to say that's Barry Bonds, but that's not Barry Bonds.  Oh, stop it.  That's not just...  Oh, just stop it.  Helen Gurley Brown.  Helen Gurley Brown is dead.  That's the answer.  That was her. 
[01:27:00]  Nick in Maine.  Tim in Pennsylvania.  Helen Gurley Brown.  She's not dead.  She's dead.  No, she's not.  Stop it.  Helen Gurley Brown.  She died recently, yes.  Oh, okay.  What was she?  The Cosmo Brut.  Oh, God.  She started Cosmo.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Mayor Menino, flu outbreak.  A lot of people suffer from this shit.  I guess this flu, you get better, and then you get worse, if that makes sense.  You start getting better, and then you feel worse.  That's what happens if it's really bad. 
[01:27:30]  A lot of people saying this flu is a motherfucker.  Yeah.  I hope they're saying it in better language than that.  No, they're basically on CNN saying it's a motherfucker.  I saw the headline.  Some deaths there in Boston, too.  Oh, good God bless.  Mayor came out and said, well, they've injured a few bathers.  There's a 24-hour wait to be seen in a hospital.  We are invisible for 24 hours?  I would go around and look at naked boobies.  Yeah, if you could be invisible for a day, that would be the best day ever. 
[01:28:00]  I would waste so much time looking at naked girls.  Of course you would.  Yes.  But where are they?  What?  What, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.?  That's what I'm saying.  At 3 p.m.  Families all over would be going, why did somebody spill tapioca in this crib?  I mean, you know, the obvious answer is a strip club, but that's like, you expect them to be naked there.  Why would you go there?  If you're invisible for a day, you want to go places where, you know, it's unexpected.  Two words, my friend.  High school.  Yeah.  Gymnasing.  High school locker room? 
[01:28:30]  High school locker room.  You go in there and fucking...  You don't think the girls are shy?  Maybe.  I would just walk through Bambergers grabbing women's cunts through their pantsuits.  Bambergers.  I can't do it.  While they're online, while they're holding perfume, I would just, like, reach them with  my invisible hand and just grab their cunt through their pants and squeeze it.  Touch them.  Ow!  They wouldn't know what happened.  No, it would hurt.  Ow! 
[01:29:00]  Just touch their meat pouches.  Oh, shit.  Well, Mayor Menino's talking about the flu.  And they're not going to see you for 24 hours.  That's how many people that have the flu.  Yeah.  But I don't know if I would...  Why would you go to somewhere else that has the flu, if you had the flu?  Like, what, the hospital?  Yeah.  Because they're just going to tell you you got the flu.  Yeah.  Right?  Well, you go there for, I guess, what?  Support.  Medicine.  Words of encouragement.  They give you an IV. 
[01:29:30]  They give you a drip.  What do they give you?  Make sure you don't have the pneumonia.  I was telling you, you know, I was telling you during the commercial break, my kid had  a little accident last night and we were debating, you know, should we get him checked out?  Per second, per second.  And I told my wife, I'm like, let's slow down here because we take him to the emergency  room.  He's going to come home with the flu.  Yeah.  We take him for just a dumb checkup.  He comes home sick because that's what happens.  They have no immune system yet.  They haven't had that buildup of all those antibodies from other things. 
[01:30:00]  So if there's anything floating around the hospital, they will fucking get it.  Yeah.  He fell, hit his ear.  It was bleeding.  Weren't sure it needed a stitch.  I'll tell you him any shit when you see a little accident.  Oh, no, no.  He fell, hit his head on the side of a coffee table and he's completely fine.  But, you know, as a parent, you're like, fuck, what do we do?  And we call our pediatrician.  Why would they call back?  Why?  So then, of course, you want to rush him to the emergency room, make sure everything's  okay, but every time we bring him to a hospital or a doctor's office, he comes home sick. 
[01:30:30]  We need coffee table control.  Huh?  Yeah.  Was it an assault coffee table?  Just get one around the edges.  But God bless Dr. Steve.  He did everything over the phone they would have done in a doctor's office or the emergency  room.  Check his pupils.  Make sure they're not dilated.  Is he puking?  Is he fucking falling asleep?  Is he walking funny?  What kind of a bump does he have on his head?  All this shit.  And that would have been five to six hours at an emergency room or a doctor's office.  And then you bring your kid home with something else because they fucking pick up everything. 
[01:31:00]  It's annoying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our stupid pediatrician wants to see our kids like every couple months.  And then that means guaranteed every couple months.  I'm talking to the parents out there.  I'm talking their language.  You bring your kid home and they're sick for two or three days just because you had to  make sure everything's cool with them.  Every checkup means they're coming home sick.  That's what happens.  That old hospital was a Petri dish.  Oh, so my point is, yeah, why would you go to the hospital if you have the flu? 
[01:31:30]  You know you have the flu.  Call your doctor.  Yeah.  And they'll tell you what to look out for.  How many people die of the flu every year?  Influenza.  80 million.  I know it's a lot worldwide.  How many in this country die of the flu every year?  I'm going to guess 1,000.  And how do we ban the flu?  Ban that flu.  How many?  I'm going to guess 1,000.  1,000 people every year in America die of the flu?  You might be right.  Mostly the elderly, right?  The elderly and confirmed.  I think it's very rare that a healthy kid dies of the flu. 
[01:32:00]  They lost one in the Boston area.  It's a horrible, tragic story, like a 17-year-old kid.  He started feeling better and he went out and started fucking around and playing around  and then he started feeling worse again.  And he got a secondary infection, turned into pneumonia.  Yeah, I say pneumonia, too.  Pneumonia.  You got to pronounce that P.  That's like Django.  Django.  Django.  Pneumoma.  Yeah.  Pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  And his kidney shut down and he fucking died, man.  I think that's really rare. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got a stat on the flu in America?  They're a sap.  Yeah.  I'm reading 30,000 to 50,000 people per year.  Wow.  Was I off?  30,000 to 50,000 per year, I guess, depending on how widespread it is.  In America?  Die from the flu every year.  Oh, yes.  Get out of here.  During a typical year in the United States, 30,000 to 50,000 persons a year die of the influenza.  No.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Floor control.  Bunk.  It's an assault flu.  That seems way too high. 
[01:33:00]  I know.  Oh, Sam.  Look into that article and see what they say.  There's something in there.  Oh.  Sam don't know shit.  That's a lot of people.  I believe it.  That's a lie.  I believe it.  I don't know why you wouldn't get the flu shot.  I'm a big fan of the flu shot.  I'm glad I got it this year.  Huge fan of the flu shot.  I've been sick a lot less.  One year I got the flu shot and I still got sick, but instead of two to three weeks, it  was a quick two to three days, man.  Really?  Yep.  You don't get flu shots, huh? 
[01:33:30]  I haven't.  I've never gotten a flu shot in my life.  I think it's the alcohol that keeps you fucking from getting sick.  You rarely get sick.  I try to stay pickled.  I had that bout during the spring.  I had that bout with the bad cough and everything.  But that was a full-fledged fever and running, stuffy nose and shit like that.  I didn't really have a headache, but the cough was just relentless.  It was terrible.  Was it the whooping cough?  I don't think it was the whooping cough, like everybody said.  It was just a really bad fucking... 
[01:34:00]  That was a bad one, dude.  Yeah.  It sucked.  It sucked.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I had that stoned Canadian over at my house take care for me.  See, I talked to the parents, and Justin Stengel, Letterman's head writer there, who's a friend  of mine and many others around here, he just texted me.  He goes, you bring your kids to the doctor's office, and they want to play...  Yeah!  Wait to hear this one!  Yeah.  And they want to play with all of the toys covered with fucking sick germs. 
[01:34:30]  This is what the doctor's office...  This is what they do.  They have a play area with all these toys, because they want to keep your kids busy.  Wow.  And it's impossible to tell your kid you can't play with the toys, because they don't  understand that shit.  Yep.  That's true.  I guess he's playing with the toys, all the other sick kids that came before you!  Put it in their mouths.  Ah!  Jesus.  Why would you do that?  I'll give my kid my phone, and we'll sit there nice.  Don't make it tempting to play with all the cool toys that he's never seen before, because 
[01:35:00]  they're different toys.  What did parents give their kids before, like cell phones?  Keys?  Uh, well, in our generation, it was the TV.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  No, I mean like you're out, right?  Oh.  You're fucking out, and you gotta hand them something.  Oh, probably.  Yeah, you probably right.  Was it the kids?  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  When I was a kid, I would play the Lima Shuffle.  It's where my mother would give me a bowl of Lima beans, and I would shake them up, and  then try to organize them from biggest to smallest.  It's the Lima Shuffle.  It's a fun game. 
[01:35:30]  I don't remember ever hearing of that.  I would spend hours entertained.  Medical patient.  Interactive radio.  Justin Stengel just wrote back.  Exactly!  Oh!  Big screaming letters.  Damn.  It's infuriating.  He knows.  Every time you bring your kid in to get a checkup, he comes home, and he's sick two  days later.  A lot of germs in those sick places.  Yeah.  With those dumb toys.  Flu.  What do you got on the flu, Sam Roberts?  That's it, huh?  Do you really believe 30,000 to 50,000 people a year die of the flu in America?  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 
[01:36:00]  Yes, the flu's terrible.  Do they break the stats down by age groups?  Oh, I bet.  If you looked at age, that's a lot of old people.  A lot of old people.  That's what takes them out?  Yeah, they got them fucking rolling paper-thinned lungs.  The second they get a little mucus in there, they're done for.  Jesus.  Well, Mayor Menino, he announced what?  Some kind of something in Boston.  Big day, big day, big day, health emergency.  Yeah, one of those health emergencies. 
[01:36:30]  I don't really know what that means.  What do you get with a health emergency when your dumb mayor says, we got a health emergency?  In Bobson, we got a health emergency.  I bet he says emergency.  How much?  Emergency.  Let's see.  Let's see if he talks better since being released from the hospital.  He was in the hospital for a while.  Yeah.  Taking care of his shit.  Today, I am declaring.  Just the way he goes, today.  It's not even today.  Today. 
[01:37:00]  Did he just say I declaring?  I declaring.  Did he just say I declaring?  And he's going to say emergency.  Today, I am declaring.  Oh, okay.  A public health emergency.  A public health emergency.  But part of that is the Boston accent.  Yes, of course it is.  To be fair.  But it's hilarious.  His fucking impediment combined with the Boston accent.  It is not good.  It's a hoot. 
[01:37:30]  Today.  Today.  I am declaring.  Declaring.  A public health emergency.  In the city of Boston.  Oh.  I said Boston.  Boston.  The latest reports show an increasingly tough.  Increasingly.  Increasingly becomes increasingly.  Increasingly.  What the fuck?  He's just a fool.  He is a buffoon.  Look, I know I don't get every word right here on the Opie and Anthony show, but fuck.  Increasingly.  I think you need your mayor to speak properly. 
[01:38:00]  Increasingly.  Increasingly.  How do you say increasingly?  Increasingly.  Increasingly.  The latest reports show an increasingly tough flu season.  We're here to give you an update on what we are seeing.  Good.  On what we are seeing.  On what we're seeing.  Seeing.  He almost has a whistle now to his voice.  Yeah.  Oh, he's great.  Talk about what we all can do. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, it sounded like it was a lemon in his mouth.  Talk about what the law can do.  That tongue was fucking running rampant right there.  He has to keep that tongue in check at every fucking word.  He needs no word, is it?  Yes.  Every moment.  And he almost lost it right there.  That's why he's in the hospital.  He's trying to have his tongue shaved out.  I like to just get a carpet just plain.  That would hurt.  Tough flu season.  We're here to give you an update on what we are seeing.  There he goes. 
[01:39:00]  Talk about what we all can do to protect ourselves and underscore the importance of taking these  issues seriously.  Today, we are announcing that this weekend in partnership with our community health centers  will be offering free flu shots across our city in a coordinated effort with the Public Health Commission. 
[01:39:30]  There will be special hours.  Again, his tongue ran off.  It tried to run behind a molar.  20 years in public life in this blithering idiot.  Oh.  He gets reelected every single time.  He's been the mayor since we left Boston.  We left in 98.  And he was there when we got there.  In a coordinated effort with the Public Health Commission.  There will be special hours and special attention given to this effort. 
[01:40:00]  I have no idea what he said.  Provided extra doses of the vaccine, free of charge, to all our partners, to accommodate  this important campaign.  What's he doing?  This important campaign.  What did he sound like?  Ira.  It was Ira.  He did an Ira.  Campaign.  Oh, please.  Can we hear that again?  Oh, I want to hear that.  Free of charge. 
[01:40:30]  Charge.  To all our partners, to accommodate.  This important campaign.  He's trying to slow it down, I think.  He knows he's a fucking mumbling moron.  The King's Speech guy must have told him, you've got to slow it down.  Dominate.  This important campaign.  We need everyone to help.  We need everyone to spread the flu this season.  Yeah.  We all have to take care of each other and work together. 
[01:41:00]  The best way...  Wait, what?  I love him.  What is wrong with this guy?  He's fantastic.  What did he just say?  And work together.  The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your family is to get the flu shot.  I've had my flu shot.  In my tongue.  I'm asking you...  It swelled up.  ...to get yours, too.  Oh.  It's especially important for young children. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  The elderly and people with certain medical conditions like asthma, heart disease, and other conditions.  That's why I can't say it enough.  Please, all of everyone out there, get to the health centers this weekend.  Get your flu shot.  Get your flu shot.  Get your flu shot.  We're giving them away over here.  Hot worm.  Make sure you don't get your hot worm.  Get your flu and tick collar. 
[01:42:00]  You get Lyme disease.  This fucking guy is the best.  Never disappoints.  No, never.  Get your...  Get noted, too.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.

[01:45:00]  Splashing around in the muck in the mire  We just got our Jimmy Superfly Snooker pictures sent us by E-Rock.  And I'm going to tweet mine.  There's some great pictures that came in from yesterday's show.  I like the Jimmy Superfly Snooker interview.  It was great.  It was very open.  Yeah, but you were very disrespectful. 
[01:45:30]  I certainly was not.  To the great one.  I certainly was not.  I was uninformed about some of the stuff that we talked about.  All right, well, I told you before he came in  Yeah.  That the woman who died in mysterious ways  had died.  She dies in mysterious ways.  And you asked, what is she doing now?  After you told the story.  That was a great, uncomfortable moment.  I thought I went too far because I looked at you guys 
[01:46:00]  and you were like, oh, fuck it.  Yeah.  I was just trying to go for the uncomfortableness of it.  And then he goes like, I used to go cliff diving.  And you yelled out, you do any of that muff diving, Jimmy?  Jimmy!  Snooks!  Just uncomfortable.  I like the Snooks.  I just kept yapping and then I'd look back.  I'd look back at Sam and be like,  I don't know what the fuck to say to this guy.  Yeah.  I was just trying to make it fun. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Give it a bit of fun.  I know he wasn't going to give us anything real deep.  No, no.  It's all in his book.  And we'd be saying stuff like,  when you jumped off that cage,  that was fantastic.  That was fantastic, Superfly.  And then he'd be like, ha ha.  And I would look at Sam like,  I don't know what to say to him.  Yeah, brother.  It was a good interview.  It'll be on the countdown.  I like when his voice goes down.  That make the countdown?  It definitely did.  He rocked.  Of course.  Wow, look at that.  I'm shooting for number one. 
[01:47:00]  Wow, look at that, huh?  He's a little heavier.  In what?  That's about 2000.  Let me see the old picture.  Yeah, yeah.  He was more with it.  No, I'm looking at the Facebook.  In this old picture,  the original Jimmy Snooker picture,  it says 0404 2013.  So that's actually in the future.  Oh, wow.  We got a picture from the future.  Yeah, it's amazing.  How about that?  Look at that, huh?  Wow.  Looks like Anthony's ready 
[01:47:30]  to fuck my bottom on the Facebook picture.  I know, I wanted it to look like that  and I wanted to do it.  How come you guys can't get a shot  with just Jimmy Snooker?  The original one had these two weird  wrestler guys in it.  Yeah, why don't we just get Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Well, this guy was at least  the co-author of the book.  Yeah, well, that's co-author.  Fuck.  That means he wrote the book.  Oh.  You're saying Jimmy Superfly didn't sit there?  I'm saying it.  I'm saying it.  I'll take the fly.  And now, where's my ink and quill, brother?  I will write...  He doesn't write, he doesn't read.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, you could do the live read, Jimmy. 
[01:48:00]  I can't read, brother.  I can't read, brother.  He's open, though.  Yeah.  Read.  He can't read, but he wrote a book.  I wrote the book.  The author interviewed Bob Backlund for the book.  I remember when it used to be  pretty prestigious to write a book.  Yeah.  You can't have a guy that doesn't know  how to read write a book.  What'd Backlund say?  Brother.  I don't know.  I guess he said a whole bunch of stuff.  I was talking to him, to John,  the guy who wrote the book.  Oh.  And he called, like, every wrestler  that Jimmy had anything going on with 
[01:48:30]  to get, you know...  Yeah.  To fill out the stories a little bit.  And he asked Ric Flair over the phone,  did you and Jimmy ever discuss the matches  ahead of time?  And Ric Flair said,  who do you think you are?  I'm not answering that question  and hung up the phone.  Really?  Yeah.  What a dick.  What is that?  Why would he get as upset with that?  I don't know.  I guess he doesn't realize that...  Everyone knows.  ...K-Fabe's been broken.  How do you spell snooker?  S-N-O-O-K-A. 
[01:49:00]  Let's get on that right away.  Apparently at 8.38 Eastern,  they start announcing Oscar nominations.  Oh, do tell.  Who do you think?  I'm going to guess for best picture...  Surrow Dark Thirty.  Oh, I thought that was mine.  Oh, wait, that's this year.  Oh, no, it was last year.  Les Misrables will be nominated for best picture.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, Les Mis has got a lot of Oscar buzz. 
[01:49:30]  Shanko.  I hate Oscar buzz.  You think Django's going to get best picture?  He's going to be nominated.  The Django.  Shanko.  Yeah, The Django will be nominated.  Best Actor Prediction.  Argo.  Daniel Day-Lewis.  What about Lincoln?  And Lincoln.  For Lincoln.  Let me guess,  it's going to be Daniel Day-Lewis for Lincoln.  Why is he talking like that?  One of the Les Mis peoples.  I think the Oscar for  should have minded your own fucking business  should go to Lincoln.  Oh, you're going to say that.  Who else? 
[01:50:00]  Joaquin Phoenix.  Oh, yeah, what about the master?  I didn't see the master.  And Dennis Levant.  Denzel.  Yeah, you know what?  Even though Flight really annoyed me,  Denzel was great in it.  He played a great drunk.  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Yeah, the story kind of fucking ate my ass,  but his performance was excellent.  Joaquin did great in the master.  Okay, I didn't see that.  So I can't comment.  Joaquin.  Well, how about we wait for the actual nominations?  How about Daniel Day-Lewis? 
[01:50:30]  I don't know what I'm saying.  I like that.  It's his name.  As Lincoln.  That's a damn good picture of Jimmy Superfly Snooker, man.  I like it.  The Superfly.  Loading image.  Just the four of us.  Okay, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Just the four of us.  We're all trying to figure out how to get the douche out of our great picture.  He can be cropped out.  His name's John.  Oh my God.  What's good is there's nothing in front of Superfly from him,  so you could chop that out.  I did this with somebody else.  There was a great picture. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, when Dennis Lurie came in.  Yeah.  I mentioned everyone in the picture,  and then I go, and some douche.  That's what I'm going to do with this one.  All you really have to do is go around Superfly in Photoshop, right?  Yeah.  And then take another picture of the background from about the same angle,  and then you could drop it right in next to Superfly.  Okay.  And you're never going to fucking even notice.  Well, you could just color over that with, like, blue or something  and say, like, there was a blue. 
[01:51:30]  What do you do?  What is this?  Oh, shit.  Hey, take the picture.  That's the picture.  That's a regular joke.  What's all this mixing and matching in Photoshop?  I don't know nothing from that.  It's just a regular joke.  Yeah, you take the picture, you look at the picture.  That's all you do.  I think Jimmy was wearing the same fanny pack in 2000 that he was yesterday.  Whoa, no way.  That's amazing.  Perfectly good fanny pack.  No reason to go buy another one.  You don't know the value of a buck.  Don't be penny-wise and dollar-foolish. 
[01:52:00]  Ah, whatever.  What are you, my grandmother?  I'm crafting a fucking tweet right now.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  About what?  Well, it's going to say me, Anthony Comia, Jim Norton, and some douche, and the douche  is in big capital letters with the wrestling legend Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  He was really excited to be able to come on the show yesterday.  I don't know who he is.  I don't care.  This is Jimmy Superfly.  His name's John.  Waterboarding?  Why do you need to know his name?  What is he going to do for you? 
[01:52:30]  Superfly.  How do you spell Snooker again?  S-N-O-O-K-A.  What the fuck are they doing?  I don't know.  They're kind of goofing on waterboarding, but that isn't really waterboarding.  He's got it over his eyes.  He's got the rag over the guy's eyes.  Are they talking about Sero Duck 30?  Maybe Sero Duck 30.  Sero.  Okay, it's ready.  Me, Anthony Comia, Jim Norton, and some douche with wrestling legend Jimmy Superfly Snooker,  and tweet.  Oh, man.  See it for yourself if you don't believe me. 
[01:53:00]  We should do the picture from 12 years ago and then the picture from yesterday.  Oh.  I think we aged all right.  Oh, boy.  Please.  Yeah, man.  I could finally grow facial hair.  That's good.  When did that happen?  Not too long ago.  Oh, man.  I know I was trying to grow fucking hair back at N.E.W., and it wasn't happening, but now  it comes in like a burly fucking lumberjack. 
[01:53:30]  See that on-air sign over the door in that picture?  You got it?  Little trivia.  It's over the studio in my basement.  God, I'm jealous.  That genuine W.N.E.W. on-air light.  It works.  It's operational and installed right there.  Nice.  Nice.  Who has the lesbian couch?  Oh, that thing.  Did we try to give it away and no one wanted it?  No one wanted it.  Give it away.  Give it away.  Give it away.  No one wanted that shite.  So we got a dog that looked like a lion. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  What happened?  I'll tell you in a few minutes.  Oh.  It's not bad, but I'll tell you soon.  Oh.  Oh, you're crafting a tweet, too?  Yes.  Oh.  Wait, are you crafting a better tweet than me?  No, I'm not even putting that picture up.  I just put one of me in Jimmy before.  I just don't know why you would call him a douche.  Why wouldn't you go with the group picture?  We all look lovely.  Why'd you have to go in the picture?  Because he stepped in.  By the way, no one asked him to be in that goddamn picture, either.  It was like, hey, Jimmy, let's take a picture.  And we all started gathering around, and he gets up and fucking edges into the picture.  I hate the one of these things is not like the others. 
[01:54:30]  But he wrote the book.  It's the show and Jimmy Superfly Snooker and then some guy.  A year from now, no one's going to give a fuck about the book.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  But they are going to give a fuck that us three are in a picture with Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  Well, he also is a fan.  He wanted to give pictures with you guys and Jimmy.  Yeah, he was a good guy.  I swear, if you take a picture of that just empty with no one there, you could absolutely  Photoshop the shit out of that.  You'd never know that he was even standing there. 
[01:55:00]  Obi, why did you just say, I don't think he was a good guy?  I don't know.  He just came across needy.  He did not.  He said like two sentences.  I know, that was plenty.  Trust me.  It was obvious.  That's all he had to say.  He wrote the book.  Ah, fuck it.  He wrote the book.  He read the book.  What do I know?  Exactly.  Whoever you are.  Regular goddamn job.  My picture looks awkward because I was trying to get your ass in the picture.  Look.  Oh.  Look.  It's not balanced.  Oh, no, no.  Because you had to stick your ass out. 
[01:55:30]  I thought that would kind of make the picture a little funnier.  I was embracing Jimmy.  Now my photo's off balance.  Yeah, it is.  It's awkward to look at.  That's good.  It's hot.  Yeah.  Bunch of things.  Bunch of men.  Sexy.  Wow.  All right.  Super fly.  Yeah.  Okay.  Super fly.  What do I know?  You're jumping off the ropes.  What are you, a spider?  Yeah, you got me.  Okay.  I'll take the fly.  You want to hear about this dog that looks like a lion?  I saw the video. 
[01:56:00]  This is great.  It's adorable, by the way.  Rocky Dogus.  My mom says, I bark like a lion.  Boo.  I saw the video.  It looks adorable.  They took this, I guess it's a labradoodle.  Yeah.  A labradoodle.  A shdoodle.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Oh, Bobo?  Yeah.  You said he didn't want to do the show anymore.  That's all right.  I don't blame him.  Do you follow him?  No.  I block him. 
[01:56:30]  Bobo?  I don't know, because there seems to be a lot of different Bobos out there.  I don't know which one's the other one anymore.  I follow him.  This poor fuck is apparently head over heels in love with this girl that lives in England.  Is this a real one?  Of course.  Yeah.  No.  She is real.  She's a real girl?  Guaranteed.  Okay.  She's a real girl.  But she lives in England.  And she has just gone back and forth with Bobo a few times.  I swear to you, every fucking five minutes, he's like, please tweet me. 
[01:57:00]  Talk to me.  I miss you.  I love you.  It's so fucking sad.  This is Jimmy's favorite topic, by the way.  It's so sad.  I just feel bad for him like this.  I do feel bad.  You know what I just realized?  Even when you have a 100% brain, this shit will drive you nuts.  That's why.  I can't imagine having a piece of your brain missing and have to deal with this.  Dude, I'm thinking back to being in love with a girl that wants nothing to do with you.  Oh, it kills you.  And he's like, every Tuesday, he's like, all right, I guess you don't want to talk to me today. 
[01:57:30]  I'm going to go to sleep now.  And then five minutes later, are you here?  Talk to me.  I did.  MTV turned the movie Catfish into a series.  Yes, series.  Yes, yes.  Bobo could be on Catfish the series, except every episode all season.  Yes.  It's an entire series.  He's just going to a different girl's house and a guy walks out every time.  Here's one.  Are you there?  I would like to talk to you.  Her name's Katie.  But I don't understand how this all came about.  Is she goofing with him? 
[01:58:00]  I don't know what her intentions are.  She apparently talks to him.  Like, not talks, but DMs and tweets with him.  But does she like him?  I don't know.  Or does she like him because he's on the show?  No, she's just being a nice gal, I guess.  Probably just someone being nice.  Okay.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  But the neediness that comes out in these tweets, it's crazy.  He's constantly wanting her to click on her right there.  Let me see this bitch. 
[01:58:30]  There she is.  She's a little red-headed English chick.  Oh, she's cute.  And that's really her?  Yeah.  I like the fact her face is a little off-center.  That's...  A little tilt to the side.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind banging her just to fucking rub it in Bobo's face.  Oh, my God.  Well, she's making a funny face there.  That's a dumb face.  Making a real dumb face right there.  Yeah, exactly.  She has a hair part like fucking Alex Jones.  Oh, uh-oh.  Well, she's on the churlix.  She's a little thicker.  Thick girl.  Roomie. 
[01:59:00]  I want you to hug me with your matronly arms.  Uh, hello.  Okay, she's not thick.  I, uh...  I don't know.  She's a wrestling fan.  Oh.  How do you know?  It's a wrestling shirt.  How do you know?  Because it's Daniel Bryan's shirt.  I don't know who that is.  You'll just...  You know what you'll see?  You'll see tweets from Bobo that say things like, um...  Like, uh...  Uh, don't listen to the fans.  They're lying.  Because they, like...  They tell him that they told her things.  And he's like, uh...  Please, Katie, uh... 
[01:59:30]  Talk to me.  Dear me.  That's sexy.  So...  I'd fuck her.  I'd put her right in her rump.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we get her on the show?  She might be listening.  We could.  She'd listen to the replay, on demand.  How does she listen?  She probably doesn't listen at all.  A little English henna head.  UFC?  No, she's familiar with the show.  Oh, is she?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like Dan Hardy!  I like Dan Hardy!  Hey, baby!  I hope she's familiar with the show.  That she didn't just meet Bobo online and get charmed.  Why don't you let me kiss you on the prick, then? 
[02:00:00]  Kiss me bum!  He's a bit retarded!  Jimmy, you cool we take a phone call from Bobo?  Oh, there he is.  Okay.  Yo, Bobo.  Bobo.  Cool.  She met Mighty Joy Young.  Bobo.  It's like, you know.  What is it?  You got the flu?  No, I'm still cold.  Oh, you got a cold?  Bobo, who is this girl?  How do you guys meet, and what's going on? 
[02:00:30]  I've been talking to her for a while.  I've been talking to her for a while.  Why is your phone screwed up?  You sound like it's too close to your face.  Well, hold it.  I mean, I've been talking to her for a while, and then eventually she just admitted to this  She admitted what?  That she likes me.  That she likes you.  Now, oh, Bobo.  But she lives in England, right?  Yeah.  Do you understand, Bobo, that you're too needy on Twitter? 
[02:01:00]  You keep hounding her.  Let's try to help him.  To get, like...  Nope.  You keep hounding her.  Why don't you lay off?  Play it a little cool.  All right.  They get to do that.  But he won't.  But you won't.  Bobo, what are you hoping happens with this?  Oh, good question.  I guess she likes you.  I highly doubt that.  But you think she likes you, and you guys communicate on Twitter, and you DM me here, 
[02:01:30]  a little direct messaging.  And are you going to go over there and take her out?  Yeah, eventually.  You're going to go to England?  Bobo in England.  How?  Eventually.  Well, how are you going to go to England?  How?  Well, hopefully, eventually, in time, yeah.  How?  How?  Here we go.  This is why I take these calls.  Fucking redundancy.  This is the only reason I take these calls. 
[02:02:00]  He has absolutely zero tolerance.  Oh, no.  I have maybe 10% tolerance.  Bobo, don't you need money to go to England?  Wait, wait, wait.  The question is simple.  Jimmy has asked.  How are you going to England?  Yes.  Not when.  How?  Well, right now, I haven't got the money, but when you've got the money, I don't go.  That doesn't answer how.  Jimmy's biting his teeth.  How are you going to get the money? 
[02:02:30]  Wait, I don't want to discuss that.  What did he say?  He doesn't want to discuss that.  Oh, whoa.  Why?  So maybe some illegal activities.  Are you going to become a drug dealer or something?  Dealing drugs to see your gal?  No.  Now, Bobo, isn't she supposed to be coming to New York at some point?  Bobo, comment?  Bobo?  She had to cancel that visit for personal reasons.  What happened?  Oh, God.  Personal reasons. 
[02:03:00]  What were her personal reasons?  Oh, God, you know.  I'm not allowed to discuss that.  Well, just tell us.  You have to discuss.  We'll take it out of the replay.  Yeah, yeah.  What personal reasons that she can't come to New York?  She didn't tell me.  Well, why are you saying you can't discuss it?  Well, I can't discuss it.  But anyway, I'm sure she'll tweet me, guys.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Tweet her.  She'll respond.  When did she decide she wasn't coming to New York? 
[02:03:30]  I don't know.  It was back a few months ago.  Well, I heard tell that she was coming to New York.  Oh.  Well, I know she supposedly is around April.  Well, that's what I was talking about, Bobo.  Are you going to see her?  Yeah, I might see her briefly before then, all right?  Right during that time.  Wait, how are you going to see her before then? 
[02:04:00]  No, I mean, during that time, all right?  She is going to be in New York around for WrestleMania.  Oh, so are you going to WrestleMania with her?  No.  Does she want to go to WrestleMania?  Yeah, she's going.  Maybe we could send her to WrestleMania.  Why aren't you going with her, Bobo?  Yeah, that would be a perfect opportunity for you two lovebirds to meet.  What's that?  I didn't buy a ticket when he went on sale.  I mean, maybe one of us could take her.  You know what?  I'll take her.  I mean, we all got pretty good hookups.  Bobo, would it be okay if one of us took her to WrestleMania? 
[02:04:30]  Because we could get tickets.  No.  No?  No.  Why not?  We'd take her out, show her a good time.  Yes.  Would she want to meet wrestlers?  First of all, she already has a ticket.  Uh-huh.  But would she want to meet wrestlers?  How about a ticket upgraded backstage and stuff like that?  Yeah, wrestlers.  Would you give your permission that we can take her out?  No, I don't think I trust that.  Why not?  Why?  You're right, Bobo.  I don't want anyone stealing her from me. 
[02:05:00]  Oh.  How are you going to England?  Yeah, how are you going to England, Bobo?  Yeah, do you even have a British accent that you've been working on at all?  Ooh.  No.  No, but I guess I could do that.  By the way, Bobo, this counts as being on the show.  You know that, right?  So you don't have to keep saying, I want to get back on the show.  You're on the show right now.  Okay?  You don't have to say, hello, Governor.  That's English Bobo.  Is that English Bobo? 
[02:05:30]  Bobo, is that you?  Yes, I'm not lying.  Bobo, where are you going to go when you get to jolly old England?  What the sights are you going to see?  I don't even know why I've got to look that stuff up.  See where we're...  Bobo.  Improv master.  See, we're supposed to be improv-ing here.  Yeah, you didn't really need to.  No.  Let's improv.  I don't know.  I've got to look some of that stuff up.  Bobo, what's some of the big attractions there in England, eh? 
[02:06:00]  Well, I'm going to go see the Buckingham Palace.  Buckingham Palace.  Buckingham Palace.  That counts.  Very good.  Why is your phone so shitty?  It really is a crappy-ass phone.  Everything about this is shitty shit.  His voice, his phone.  Bobo.  Bobo.  His lack of focus.  He doesn't answer any questions.  Like, why did she not come to America?  Exactly.  What was the reason?  Now, answer me, or I'm going to have her send me vag pictures.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  That'd be nice.  She did not say that.  There's a reason why.  But then you say you can't talk about it, or is that for something else?  No, because she'd want to talk about personal reasons.  Okay.  All right.  So, she's coming in April.  You're going to go out with her, though?  Yeah.  Where are you going?  What's a night out with Bobo going to be like with Katie?  I'm not sure.  I guess I'll take her someplace. 
[02:07:00]  I guess I'll show her around a little bit.  How about something more than someplace?  You haven't thought about this?  You haven't fantasized about your girl coming 5,000 miles to see you?  You have to have some kind of idea of a date.  Yeah.  A night out.  What would that be?  Yeah, Bobo.  I'll show her around Manhattan a little bit.  What would you show her?  What are some of your favorite spots to take the ladies?  Yeah.  Well, I'll show her Central Park.  Oh. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, boy.  Outside of the box.  It's a very big place.  So, a little walk through Central Park?  Yes, that's where he's going to remain, outside of the box.  During the daytime.  During the daytime, right, because of black people.  She retweeted Jim.  Must be a fan of Jim Norton.  Oh, boy.  When did she do that?  Oh, boy.  When did she do that?  Just this morning.  Which one?  Your picture with Jimmy Snuka.  Wait, that just happened.  I mean, she might be listening.  Oh, cool.  Well, she might just see it on Twitter. 
[02:08:00]  And you've got to remember, she is a wrestling fan.  Oh.  And the other thing is, if it's available, that day I might take her on a tour of Medicine Square Garden.  Well, now, how would you get that tour?  They offer it.  Oh, does it cost money?  Yeah.  How are you going to get the cash, Bobo?  Oh, my gosh.  I got the cash right for that, right?  Oh, I got the cash for that, right?  I'm a big spender of a roller-rubble whale.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  That's pretty cool.  She would like that, you think?  Yeah, of course.  Believe me.  What do you guys talk about?  Do you guys have each other's phone number?  Do you talk to each other, or is it just on Twitter?  I talk to her on Twitter, right?  Wait, why not on her phone?  Why don't you call her?  Yeah, why don't you call her?  Oh, boy.  They're too expensive.  Why don't you talk on Google Voice on the computer?  It's free.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Or web chat.  Or Vonage.  Are we done with this?  Yep.  I've got to ask her about that one. 
[02:09:00]  I'm going to start tweeting my new girlfriend.  Where is she?  Oh, man.  Do you want us all to follow her, Bobo?  Should we follow her?  Yeah.  I'm not going to follow her.  I'm just going to tweet her and get to know her.  All right.  You can go ahead.  I'm glad you added a lot here today.  Really made terrific radio.  Thank you.  I think I'm going to stick it in her.  Thank you for that.  Would a date be okay?  Yeah, if I just take her out once.  If Jimmy wants to take her out on a date.  Bobo.  Maybe in the car. 
[02:09:30]  This is my last.  All right.  This is my last try, and then I will do the old tap-a-roo.  Oh, I see.  Bobo, if she was willing, and everything works out, and you're in Manhattan, and you take  her to some cheap pizza joint and walk through Central Park with greasy pizza, what are you  expecting to get off her, if she was willing?  Well, I'm saying if she was, yeah, I would expect to sleep with her. 
[02:10:00]  Wait, you would expect?  More vagary.  What kind of sleeping with her?  And where would that take place?  At your mom's house?  Well, I don't know.  Well, think about it.  Yeah, Bobo.  Park Bench.  Central Park.  I don't know.  Hotel somewhere.  Oh, a hotel.  So you open it up.  What kind of hotel?  Queens.  Well, I get...  The Carter?  No, I can tell you not there.  Oh, okay.  I can tell you not there.  Is it that shitty motel that your uncle ran?  No.  All right.  No.  Well, I wouldn't pay for a room there if I needed to escape a bunch of zombies. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, go on.  That's true.  Chip should be pissed at you.  That was a good one.  Came together at the end.  If he wanted to escape some zombies.  Why would you pay for a hotel to escape from zombies when you just keep running?  Wouldn't the clerk bite you while you handed him your credit card?  No.  What I meant is if it was the only option, I wouldn't pay for that. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  I understand.  That was a little lacking.  So, what kind of cheap hotel would you go to?  Do you have any others in mind?  What area?  Manhattan?  I like this Katie Queens.  Where?  You do?  Yeah.  Well, there's one not far from me.  I'm going to take her to my house and put it in her.  Oh, God.  Are you following her?  No, but she's tweeting me now.  Ooh.  Yeah.  She called me Hun.  Oh.  And adorable.  And a little cutie.  Whoa.  Oh. 
[02:11:30]  So, why doesn't she call the show?  Donna wants to know.  She can't listen.  She's in England.  I like Jim's smooth line.  Thanks for the retweet, baby.  Uh-oh, Bobo.  Uh-oh.  Bobo, you got competition.  No, no, but there's a reason why she can't call the show.  What's the reason?  Why?  Is Bobo in her picture, by the way?  I know why.  Yeah, Bobo's in her headline picture, and it's with a sign saying, Merry Christmas, Katie Corliss.  Is it true, Bobo, that black people stole her phone? 
[02:12:00]  Bobo?  No.  No, I don't know who stole her phone.  Didn't they knock her down and steal her telephone?  No, I don't know who, right?  How does Anthony know so much?  I've been keeping tabs.  You have.  On this little budding relationship.  She sent me her number.  I have her number.  Oh!  Wow.  How come she didn't send me her number for me?  What's that?  How come she didn't send me her number? 
[02:12:30]  I don't know.  She sent it to me, though.  She asked me to give her a call any time.  You have it now?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, no worries.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Bobo.  So why don't you give her a message right now?  Because this is like a free phone call.  She's listening.  You're here.  What would you like to say to her?  Well, the thing is, I can't even tweet while I'm on the phone.  What would you like to say to her?  Oh, my God.  Well, I'd like to say to her, right, if I could have her number. 
[02:13:00]  And also, if you are listening, please call in.  No, spill your guts out to her.  Bobo.  Yeah, say something.  Please call in.  Make her not want to go out with Jimmy and go out with you instead and give you her number.  I got her number.  Oh, I've been talking to you for a while.  You don't need to go out with Jimmy, right?  I've been good to you for so long.  Oh.  Anything else? 
[02:13:30]  For a number of months.  What about another month?  No, I mean months I've been.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  This is why you're not on the show.  Just tap out.  Right.  I'm out.  Bobo.  Right.  I'm going to take her out and just talk to her for you.  Yeah.  Is that okay?  You want me to get you a bunch of wrestling autographs to give to her?  Yeah, I'll give her some wrestling autographs.  I'll take her to meet some wrestlers. 
[02:14:00]  It's going to be a good time.  Will that be okay, Bobo?  If Jimmy does that and just talks about you?  No.  I should do that before she sees me first.  Maybe she'll see you next trip.  Yeah, next trip.  No, I'm not going to let her do that, all right?  Send her back on that British airway.  She's playing with a little limp.  I'm texting with her.  You're not going to WrestleMania.  Jim can.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, well, you think I would have been given a ticket so I could see her?  Well, what do you want me to say to her?  Because she and I are texting right now. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, that's nice.  We got her on the line there, Bobo.  Oh.  We are your friends in the end.  All right, let's talk to Katie.  Katie.  Bobo, you're on the phone with Katie.  Go ahead.  Hello, Bobo.  How are you?  Hello, Katie.  I can't wait to meet you when I come to New York.  This really is you.  What?  Bobo, what do you have planned for us?  I'm traveling a long way. 
[02:15:00]  It is her, Bobo.  Well, Jimmy gave us the number that she gave.  We figured we'd help you out for once, so talk to Katie.  All right.  Well, I do plan on taking you out to eat some fight scene.  And then what?  Some fight scene, I guess.  Whatever.  I've traveled a long way.  I can't wait to meet you.  What happens if you keep me all hot and randy?  Yeah, well, I am going to take you to a hotel room. 
[02:15:30]  You know what?  Oh, a hotel room.  Yeah.  Bobo, I'm touching myself.  Keep going.  More.  Yeah, right, yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'm rubbing my limey breasts, Bobo.  Keep going.  Yeah, it works. 
[02:16:00]  Limey breasts.  She's rubbing her limey breasts.  How about ruminy?  Bobo, I'm salivating to my awful ladies.  Please, Bobo, tell me now.  Can we please talk about guns again?  I'm putting a crumb in my awful stinking vagina.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  Well, Katie, thank you so much. 
[02:16:30]  All right, Katie.  Very good.  All right, Bobo.  All right, Bobo.  All right, Bobo.  We got to let you go.  You didn't really add much today.  You struck out.  You were on the show, though.  How about that?  All right.  Congratulations.  Mark it down on your calendar.  You were on the show.  All right, Bobo.  I'm going to start counting another 100 days.  You all right?  Oh, he hung up.  Oh, gee, he did.  Wow.  He's probably very upset.  I know we're all big fans of lists.  The listeners love lists.  Love a good list.  What do you got 21 years ago today? 
[02:17:00]  A top 100 list.  What happened?  I got a top five list that we're going to do next.  You know what we missed yesterday?  Actually, what Iraq missed?

I just thought it would have been, you know, pertinent because we could have played.  Oh, we could have played the whole twist thing with the Zabra Cadabra. 
[02:17:30]  Now we can't because it's not the day.  Why?  Why don't we start doing Today in History plus one?  Yeah.  No one does that.  Can we do Today in History plus one?  Is that like getting show prep at 8 o'clock?  Yes.  All right.  We're going to break with something.  Donald Trump.  Oh.  I love him.  I absolutely love Donald Trump, man.  Yeah, this is a good one.

Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving and learning with Mike  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind  And hosts his own daytime TV show, giving dating advice  That's how it is, everybody know, you stick with your ex even though you break up until you find somebody whose sex is better or just as good

[02:23:30]  Booga, booga!  Weekday afternoons this fall  It's Mike  Woo!  Hosted by Mike Tyson  What do you say, champ?  What do you...  Sirius XM  XM  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Really fast  Then we're going to go into the list that was handed in to us 
[02:24:00]  I got a list in front of me  And I think we should read this list  Because it's kind of important  Is your kiss, your kiss on my list?  No  No  Got a story out of Cleveland  Ohio  Ohio  It's a list  It's a list that is...  Who has the worst customer service?  Oh, I read that  You did? 
[02:24:30]  Yep, I read the top 10, 15  Is this like single companies or genres?  A couple genres and single companies  A lot are in the same genre  And there's absolutely a reason why I'm reading this list  But I'll start with number 5  Number 5 is Bank of America  If you call Bank of America  Excuse me  It's an average phone wait time  Wait before you get to talk to someone  10 to 25 minutes  Damn  English proficiency  Solid  That means they got the English people  Not the Indians 
[02:25:00]  Overall mood of customer service agent  Depends  Knowledge of customer service agent  Average  That's 5  Don't worry  There is a big get here  Why we're doing this list  Oh boy  U.S. Airways is number 4  U.S. Air  You call them  15 to 55 minute wait  Wow  English proficiency  Good  Overall mood of customer service  Variable  And then average on the knowledge of customer service agent  Third place  Is this fine company 
[02:25:30]  Coming in at number 3  And the reason why I mentioned this list  You said you read the list  I didn't see that  What fine company is number 3  Sirius XM satellite writing  I didn't see that  Cool  We made the list  With your friends O.B. Anthony and Jim Norton  I did not see that  Wait  It's the only reason why I'm reading a list like this  Where's number 3  I didn't see that  That's the list  Sam  Sam  You're looking at it  Listen to me  The only reason I bring this up  Because a lot of my day 
[02:26:00]  I read tweets from people  That fucking yell and scream about  The Sirius XM app  Which by the way is still not fixed  No  We have complaints every single day  As far as trying to listen to us on demand  To defend the company  We've only been talking about it for maybe a week or two weeks  No  See that's wrong  That's true  You're right  You're right  Right  But  Especially in the afternoon  A lot of complaints about the Sirius XM app  A lot of complaints about on demand listening  Lots of complaints in general  About the service at Sirius XM 
[02:26:30]  Content of show  And we've got new owners coming in Liberty Media  So I'm talking to them today  One of the things they've got to fix  Is their customer service  I hear from people all the time  Like look  They'll tell me their wait time  They'll tweet it  Oh  I've been on hold for an hour and a half  Hang in there pal  That's what I tell them  Hang in buddy  Number 3  I said I'm a little kitten  Hang in there  He's on the little pole  Number 3  On the worst customer service list  Is Sirius XM satellite radio  Average phone wait time 
[02:27:00]  25 to 55 minutes  For this  For this dumb service  For this  It's not like you have to worry about your bank accounts  Just for this dumb thing  Yeah  You have to wait up to 55 minutes  Just to talk to someone  English proficiency  Low to medium  Wow  Where are they sending the calls?  Outsourcing  Ninja  Overall mood of customer service agent  Not great  Surly  Knowledge of customer service agent  Good  So there you go  We come in third 
[02:27:30]  The only ones  Worse than us  Are  Insert cell phone company here  Oh okay  Alright that's the genre  Yeah  Yeah those are terrible  And then  A place called  Saveology  I don't know what that means  Saveology  What list does this do?  Because I read a totally different one  No you didn't  No you didn't  This is the official list  Out of Cleveland  From  WKYC.com  Wow  And I see one of these guys  Every time I see like newsmen  In another city  I go  Oh I remember when he used to work in New York  Do we do that ever? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah yeah  And you're like  I wonder what happened to that guy  They got one of our guys  I remember when he was on in New York  What happened there?  The black guy  And then all of a sudden  Like he's  He's gone  And you forget  You know  You go about your life  And then you see him pop up somewhere else  Hey  Remember him  You got the list?  Doesn't matter  I just did the list  Yeah  Just did the list  I don't need proof that I fucking got the list  On the up and up  Listed is listed  No I had a different one  There it is  Maybe you had the one for stupid people  There it is  That's not what the fucking list was  It's a fucking 
[02:28:30]  It's a fucking  It's a fucking list  It's just a fucking list I read  I like that we get to read that today  Because certainly our listeners have complained about customer service for years  That and the app in general  I fucking like it too  Do you think  You think there's such problems with the R app  Because there's that many people trying to use the app?  I'd like to think so  That would be bittersweet  Well what do you think the reason is? 
[02:29:00]  I think it's all bitter  I think there's either incompetence  Complete incompetence  But why do the other channels seem to work?  That's what they tell me  Or my other thing is somebody who runs it  Does it  Just can't stand us  Has a personal vendetta  And has decided to leave our show off of the app  It's a false flag  Mankow?  Bubba?  Bubba?  Mankow?  No  Alex Jones? 
[02:29:30]  There you go  We did this bit right Iraq?  They all sound the same?  Many times  Can I have that disc?  Many times  We got our Oscar nominations in front of us here  Yes we do  Very excited  Hollywood  I have realized that being a parent means I don't get to see any movies  Because there's nine Best Picture nominations  I haven't seen one of them  And it's my business to see these fucking movies so we can talk about them  I've seen some  I've seen one 
[02:30:00]  You've only seen one  Zero Dark Thirty  I thought you saw Django I thought  Oh no that's coming to a theater near you  I will be seeing Django this evening  I want to see Silver Linings Playbook  But Sam said it wasn't that great  De Niro got nominated  Good for De Niro  Silver Sun Pickups?  What?  Nothing  Sorry  Awkward  I just saw Silver and I got excited  Oh  Beast of the Southern Wild 
[02:30:30]  Best Picture nomination  I don't even know what that's about  I don't even know what the movie's about  That's how pathetic I am  What's it about?  What is that?  Anyone  Anyone?  I didn't see it  It was  A Beast of the Southern Wild?  Yeah  It's about a bunch of beasts  In the wild  In the south  Yes  We're in third grade again  That sounds like I should see  Official trailer for it 
[02:31:00]  Let's see  I don't know what it is  I haven't heard of it  No  Oh, the advertisement  Yeah, that's a cool song  Skip ad  What?  Skip ad  Skip ad  Here it is  PG-13  Fox Searchlight  Presents  One of the most striking narrative films ever  To blah blah  I don't even give you time to read it  The whole universe  Uh-oh  Depends on everything finished together

It's raining  All right, there he goes  Get back here  The first  Here is an aurox  A fierce creature  The stars tell me  The stars tell me  The first  Yawn  I'm your daddy  It's just my job  To change candle 
[02:32:00]  Okay  Is this Django?  It's a monster movie  No, it's not  Transport  They allow you to read  One of the words  Out of the twelve  That were just up there  All right  So they have  This looks boring  They had a big like  Typhoon-y flood  This looks so terrible  Fucking bad  It's a terrible trailer  I see that I'm a little piece  Of a big, big universe  This stinks  Nice  Who cares 
[02:32:30]  The story of  They're showing the end  They're showing the end  Of the movie  The kid running  It's stupid  Good  What's in the house?  It's a big pinecone house  Or a big porcupine house  You're gonna be the key  In the bed, Tom  I promise that  In a million years  When kids go to school  They gotta know  Once there was a high school  And she lived with her daddy  In the bed  Sure  There's a big monster  Oh, she's not 
[02:33:00]  She's a child  Fuck, does that look  Fucking terrible  That looked bad  Well, I don't even know  What the movie's about  Well, it's up for best picture  So great job with the trailer  Because I still don't know  What it's about  Wow  Then you got  Silver Linings  Idris Elba  Sorry, Idris Elba  Is it nominated for something?  Hey, is that  What's his name?  It's Prince Tramble, yeah  Yeah  Stringer Bell  Hells, yeah  What was he in?  I don't know 
[02:33:30]  Did Django?  No  No  When are the black movies  Came out?  I don't know  That he's nominated  Oh, you got  Silver Linings Playbook  What's that about  Real Fast Sam?  Because I think you saw that one  It's just a silly  Hollywood romantic comedy  Except they both have bipolar  Yuck  Well, that's  Hence the Oscar nod  Jennifer Lawrence looks good in it  But beyond that  How's De Niro?  He's fine  He plays an old man  Was he good though?  Was his performance terrific?  No  De Niro stinks  I'm gonna just fucking say it  He has stung for a while  You can't 
[02:34:00]  He's been horrible  He's an American institution  You wanna hang in there  And fucking  He's great  I remember  Don't do it  Casino  And good fellas  But, you know  He stinks  Taxi driver  Exactly  Same guy as  Meet the Parents guy, huh?  First Meet the Parents was good though  Come on  I gave a laugh at that one  Oh, when he fucking  Started doing like  Brockie and Bullwinkle  That was good  That shit  That was terrific  Oh, boy  Zero Dark Thirty  He's on the best picture list 
[02:34:30]  Uh, Lincoln's on the list  Lincoln's gonna walk away  With every fucking award  This Oscar  Mark my words  I don't know  De Django's gonna have something  To say about that  No, no, no, no  No, I think it's too pop  But I think they split it  I think they split it  Nope  But it's only  It's not nominated that much  Nope  Fuck Lincoln  There's some very good actors  Lincoln runs away  With the Oscars  Giz, giz  But, yeah  I think you might be right  I think so  Although, no 
[02:35:00]  You know what?  Yeah  No  What?  No  Oh, fuck  Zero Dark Thirty  Like a dog?  Best Picture  Wow  No  Daniel Day-Lewis  Best Actor  Wow  Watch out for  Les Mis  Anne Hathaway's  Gotten a lot of buzz  Yes, but she's not an actor  Here's the headline  The next day  Les Mis  Les Snubbed  That's what I said  Or Les Missed  Les Missed  Yes  Oh  Ooh  Ooh 
[02:35:30]  Shut out of the Oscars  So Daniel Day-Lewis  Mm-hmm  As Lincoln  Lincoln  I think Best Picture  Might be Zero Dark Thirty  No way  It's too fucking  Too  They already gave her  Best Picture for The Hurt Locker  She's already won something for this  They like her  But that was different  Yeah, and they're not gonna give her another one  They like to spread that shit out  Best Director  Might be Ang Lee for Life of...  No  Oh, wait  She's not even nominated for Best Director 
[02:36:00]  They finally  Give Spielberg another Oscar  Maybe you're right  Cause she's not nominated for Best Director  You sure?  Yes  If that Beast of the Southern Wild wins anything  I swear to God  What if it takes it away?  I'm gonna lay into my television set  What if it's one of those artist movies  That nobody saw  That takes everything away?  The trailer enough told me to stay away  Stay the fuck away  Then we got Lincoln  Best Picture  Then the Les Mis  And then you got The Life of Pie 
[02:36:30]  And then you got  That sounds delicious, though  And then you got what?  Amar  Fucking chip is hilarious  Amar  The Django Unchained  Of course, some would say Django  Everybody would  Some  Some say Django  And you got The Argo  Argo  Argo  It's like a fun movie  Yeah  And then instead of going through all this  Some honorable mentions  Sure  Denzel Washington in Flight for Best Actor  Oh 
[02:37:00]  Joaquin Phoenix for The Master  I think Daniel Day-Lewis gets it for Lincoln  I haven't even seen the goddamn movie  Best Actor  He was tremendous  I'm basing all my Oscar picks on trailers  I saw the trailer  Enough to be able to judge  Whether it should get an Oscar  For directing, you could tell  Acting, you could tell  That's a pretty good way to look at it  You can  It's amazing what you can see  Oh, look at the cinematography  It's great  I don't need to sit there for two fucking hours  Give me two minutes 
[02:37:30]  And I'll fucking tell you  Silver Linings Plague book  Got nominated in every single category  All right, good for that  And what?  Is it just one of these simple little fucking  It's a bullshit movie  Bullshit  It is, huh?  It's not great  Like Love Actually  With fucking, what?  With bipolar  So it's this year's retard movie  Yes  Every year you gotta have  Not a retard  But I mean, every year  You gotta have somebody  That's a little different  Than the rest of the world  They figured it out  They figured out how to get  The best looking people in Hollywood  To be in the retard movies  By making them bipolar  Instead of physically 
[02:38:00]  Full retard?  Full retard?  They're bipolar  Best Supporting Actor  We'll go to  Philip Seymour Hoffman  The Master  Is she all right?  Is she all right?  Is she all right?  Dumbest question ever asked in a movie  Fucking twitching and bleeding  From the face  Yes  Is she all right?  Is she all right?  Are we done with that?  That's our whole Oscar break right there?  Damn  I mean, cause they're not  Squeak another fucking hour out of that 
[02:38:30]  We gotta have our stuff  Like this  It's the Radio Voice  Hall of Fame  Wow  The Radio Voice  Hall of Fame?  Yeah  Yeah, and we put people in there  And we got a montage  Of the people that are in there  Ready?  You wanna hear it?  This is great  Try to figure out all these people  Okay  It's not one guy  I swear to you  I knew it  Try to figure all of them out  How many guys is it? 
[02:39:00]  I would guess  Cause I remembered another one  It's at least four E-Rock  Maybe five?  Yeah, I think five  Are they gonna fire  Are you firing them out all at once?  It's a montage  A montage  Ready?  Yeah  And I don't like when people call me Todd Clem  Because that's not my name  My name's Bubba the Love Sponge Clem  I had it legally  I guess Bubba  It's like it's one of the ongoing  On their adult education course  That teaches men  How to get more tail for less money  You never wanna come on after a show  That was popular  And I understand that  And I never wanted to do it  I never ever  And it was offered to me at one point

Huh?

Dr. Lucas' fiance is black  Did not make it to the prep sheet  It should  It really should have  It should have  When they announced  They were getting married 
[02:44:30]  Which was recently  Maybe it did that day  Well, it should have been on there  Maybe it was  Not that she was black  Has he ever been married before?  Good question, Jimmy  That's a really good question  Married to his work, Jimmy  That's what he was  Divorced in 83  Oh, he was married  White chick?  Black chick  Hang on  Born in 93  Lucas was in a relationship  With Linda Ronstadt  Linda Ronstadt  See, he's a cornball brother  Okay, it looks like

Sam, what the fuck, right?  What the fuck indeed  That's cray  See, that's the  That shit cray  What did Linda Ronstadt sing?  She sang a lot of stuff  I know  She sang  I've been cheated  Oh yeah  Boom  Been mistreated 
[02:46:00]  Boom  When will I be loved  I've been cheated  No one's gonna join in  Fuck yes  I've been cheated  Boom  Been mistreated  When will I not be loved  I've been put down 
[02:46:30]  Boom  It's a very folky, rocky, crossover thing she had going  She did very well for herself in the late 70s, early 80s  But that's not her big hit  No, she's had quite a few though  I mean, this was certainly a hit  Blue Bayou was her, uh, like, ballad kind of, uh, song  I just want her biggest hit  I'm trying to remember  What's her big hit?  Sam, comment?  Uh, if you just give me a list of her hits  I'll tell you which one it was  Right, give her the fucking list  What's wrong with you, Sam?  Together?  What?  Together?

[02:47:30]  Not really  Did you used to date Jerry Brown?  Yes  Yes  Yes, Jerry Brown  The, uh, who is now the governor of California  Good call  What was he back then?  He was the governor of California  He was then, yeah  Yeah, he is now too, though  Heat Wave  Ah, yeah, that's the one  She had a good voice  I mean, a lot of power 
[02:48:00]  Now she's all fat  Now she's a slob  Yeah  Heat Wave  Is that why you're not exercising?  Child of the 80s?  Yeah, it's child of the 80s shit  Oh  Yep, absolutely  Right in that wheelhouse  Yeah  How did we get here?  I thought this was a much older song  I love when all of a sudden we're somewhere  I don't even know how he got here 
[02:48:30]  Where is his song?  I would go with the late 70s  I thought that was like a 60s or 50s song  Well, it was  I'm going late 70s  It's the remake  78, 79  The Martha and the Vandellas  Yeah, but she made them even more popular, I think  Did this one  What year was Heat Wave?  1963  And then her version was 75  Oh, 75  Fuck  I really want the Django fucking action figures  Yeah, huh?  Yeah  That's cool  You could, uh, you could bid for them on eBay  Wow  Why Linda Ronstadt? 
[02:49:00]  Does anyone know?  Oh, because George Lucas, who's dating a black broad  Yes  Or is going to marry a black broad  That's what happened  Used to date Linda Ronstadt  But we don't know which version he dated  I'm going to guess  83  I'm going to guess the starting to turn fat version  What year was Linda Ronstadt, Sam?  You said you knew  I did, but you had me looking up all kinds of Linda Ronstadt  Oh, you've got to remember these things  Yeah, man  You've got to be quick with the Google  The Google  Oh, God, we heard the song 
[02:49:30]  I was thinking we should play this again  It's so weird to  Foul  Um, yeah  During the 80s  Yeah  All right  But early to late 80s makes a giant difference with Linda Ronstadt  I think it started going bad in the late 80s for her  When he was divorced in 1983  So you'd say mid to late  At least mid-80s  Yeah  Let's find a 1985 picture of Linda Ronstadt and go  Perfect  Perfect  And go  Can we do this?  And go  That's right  1985 Linda Ronstadt  Let's see what pops up  Yeah, see 
[02:50:00]  Um, yeah  See  She's getting pudgy right there  No, that's not it  That's a 70s version  Man, when she had that long straight black hair  And those big hoop earrings  Yeah  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  She started looking like  That's like she did that theme album  She did like a standards  How do you know that?  And then she sang it  It's some Mexican songs, too  I remember from the old days  I don't know why  All right, so we got a lion  Or actually we got a dog that looks like a lion  Right  And a little town 
[02:50:30]  I think it's in Norfolk  In a small town  Virginia, somewhere around there  These idiots  We're calling 911  About this dog  It's a Labradoodle  Who is shaved  Except for what looks like a giant lion mane  And the little puffy thing at the end of the lion's tail, right?  And then it's face is shaved, too  So it really looks like a lion  But it's very tiny  And people thought it was a small lion  Are you lying?  A lion  Are you lying?  I'm not lying  It really looked like a lion? 
[02:51:00]  A bloying  Yeah, it looked like a lion  I'm not bloying  It did look like a lion  Yeah  And it just amazes me  That people don't know  That a baby lion  Because they were calling it a baby lion  A small lion  It wouldn't have the mane  It didn't look like a lion to me  It didn't look like a lion?  It looked like an almost lion  Right, it looked like a silly  Where I could go, oh wow, that almost looks like a lion  Right, you wouldn't call 911  No  Let me see it  Mr. Beloyed  You want to hear the 911 calls?  Oh yeah  Yeah, they're so bad  Listen to these dummies 
[02:51:30]  Alright, reports of a lion on the loose in Norfolk, Virginia  They turned out to be somewhat exaggerated  Like a lot exaggerated  Some very startled people called 911  To report that a lion was roaming the streets  Listen to this  No, it's 911, where's your emergency?  Well, I got to report a lion setting  And I just saw an animal that looked like a small lion  They had the mange and everything  But I just saw a baby lion in Collier Avenue and Siskiah 
[02:52:00]  I need a bambalance  There was a lion that ran across the street  A baby lion  Oh, okay  It was about the size of a Labrador retriever  Right, because it's a dog  A lion the size of a Labrador retriever  That last caller was actually on to something  Because the reason the lion was the size of a Labrador retriever  Is because the lion was actually a Labradoodle  Okay  Between a lab and a poodle  His name is Charles the Monarch  And this is why he looks like a lion  The owner gets him groomed to look like the mascot from nearby Old Dominion University 
[02:52:30]  We're told he's much better with kids than a lion would be  He really does  Okay  I love the human interest story  Shut up  You'll be calling 911 too  How adorable  They're taking my guns  Shut up  Fucking idiot  They're just trying to have a little fun  A dog that looks like a lion  And I work with a man who looks like an ass  Yeah  You wouldn't call the 911 on that 
[02:53:00]  Nah  Just shows you there's a lot of dumb people out there  Oh, there's a lion  It's going down the West Side Highway  It just turned  It just turned  Why aren't you here  It's tinkling on  Oh yeah  It's got a sign on the back  It says I'm a lion  Call police  Where are the cops  That's adorable  Isn't they very cute like a lion  Actually okay  It looks more like a lion  In that  Labradoodles are that big  Labradoodles are awesome  Are they a cool dog  I don't want to get one  They're really nice  They look a little  Hypoallergenic, right 
[02:53:30]  Yeah  I want to just scruff them up  Ah, get over here  Yeah  I think they get their ass kicked on the street  But in general  If you keep them in the house  They're cool  Not if you shave them like a lion  True  People are scared  True  Scared the kids  Did you see the invisible car prank?  Mm-hmm  I try not to bring too much of this to the show  I kept getting the link  I wouldn't watch it  It's alright  Is it?  Yeah, man  I don't watch things on purpose sometimes  Because I assume they're going to just suck  Especially if I get them  Like a lot  Nah, this one  Wasn't bad?  This guy pulled it off 
[02:54:00]  I think it was on break.com  I'm sure Iraq, as we speak  He's going to put it on our Facebook page  Hopi and Anthony  This guy  I think he explains it in front of the clip  If not, we'll stop there  Wouldn't it be cool?  Oh, advertisements  Love them  This guy made a  A facade, basically  A fake seat  A fake seat?  And he was driving behind the fake seat  So it looks like the car is driving without anyone  Who what?  Who what?  And he did a really good job  Making the seat look like it was the original seat 
[02:54:30]  Okay, so for this prank  What I did was  I built this car seat costume  And what I'm going to do  With this costume is  I'm going to put it on  And I'm going to go through a drive-thru  And I'm going to show you how it looks  In the inside of the car  Oh, wow  But look, it blends right in  Look, it blends right in  It's very clever  So this is how the costume looks  While I'm wearing it  And let's see how people react  When a car  With no driver 
[02:55:00]  Rolls up to their drive-thru window  He pulls it off, man  And that looks very cool, right?  Look at the car  Black people don't like magic  No, they hate it  She thinks it's some kind of voodoo  And she ran away  Now it becomes way too much of a visual  But  There's no one in the car  The car just pulled up  There's like a ghost driving it  Just drove this car up  Oh, my God  Did it just run in the car  And it drove up?  Okay, I guess you're here  Where's his hands? 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my God  It scares people  That's pretty funny  He lets go of the steering wheel  For, you know, the full effect  Uh-huh  They're running away  Jesus  She's probably all high  Freaking her out  Oh, my God  That's a good one  Are you crying? 
[02:56:00]  The black people are the best  Really?  This black chick  Girl  Hello?  Are you serious?  Look, they just stare  They're trying to figure out  And then it pulls away  With no one in it  Girl  Is this a brownie?  Yeah  Oh, my God  Am I tripping, son? 
[02:56:30]  Am I tripping, son?  Oh, that's great  Am I tripping, son?  Like, I'm not tripping  That's the brown big one  Instagram, not junk  Oh, snap  Black people are hilarious  They're the best  Oh, snap  Come see this  She's looking around 
[02:57:00]  They are so puzzled  They can't figure it out  No  He's looking around  Like, behind him  He keeps looking  He's turning his head  And looking back  Where'd he go?  Where'd he go?  Just throw it in here  I'm a ghost  Throw it in there 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yeah  I'm a ghost  Thank you  And then pulls away  With no driving  Fuck  Where does he keep his hand?  On the inside part of the wheel?  No  I'm sure he does  Yeah, he's only pulling up a little bit  So when he drives away  Is his hand just like at the bottom left?  You could pull away without touching the steering wheel  Yeah, you ever not touch the steering wheel  When you pull away from drive-thru?  Yeah, never  I always hold the wheel  10 o'clock  I say 10-2  10-2  As soon as you're out of their eyesight  I'm sure he grabs the wheel  And gets the fuck out of it 
[02:58:00]  Mm-hmm  That was  Black people are the best at that stuff  They're just  Hilarious  Oh, snap  The seat looks  The seat he made  It looks pretty damn good  That's pretty fucking good  Looks very believable  Good, man  Yeah  He just sits like half a seat  In his lap  That's pretty much it  And he could see through the headrest  He's got like some kind of thing  That the fake headrest  Has like  It's transparent  But you can't tell  That he can see through it  So wait  The  Oh, his lap  He's actually sitting in the seat?  He's sitting in the seat  Which is probably pushed back further  And then he puts that in his lap 
[02:58:30]  And it covers him completely  And he looks through the headrest part  That's pretty fucking clever  Yep  And then move the seat back  Looks exactly like the other seat  We did something like that  Did you, Chipper?  On our bikes  How would you  I'd pull up and I'd go  My friend passed away  And he's with us right now  Bill Maher was on Jay Leno 
[02:59:00]  That's astounding  And he made a bet  With Donald Trump  And this is why Donald Trump is great  I don't have to agree with everything he does  But man, he is entertaining as all hell  This is how it went down on Leno  With Bill Maher  You know, look  I'm not looking  For a feud with Donald Trump  And I certainly only wish the best  For the syphilitic monkey 
[02:59:30]  Who does his Twitter feed  But  Yeah  A syphilitic monkey  Which is even worse  Well, the monkey thing  That's the  I think that's what got him so mad  Because we did a new rule  One week  That  Supposed that perhaps  Donald Trump  Had been the spawn  Of his mother  Having sex with an orangutan  Because  Well, I didn't just make this up  The color of his hair  Yeah  And the color 
[03:00:00]  Of an orange orangutan  Is the only two things in nature  Of the same color  So  Is that what this picture is?  Oh, there you go  Jay  I wonder what that was for today  I'm not  I'm not saying it's true  Right  I hope it's not true  Right  But  Unless he comes up with proof  I'm willing to  I'm willing to offer  Five million dollars  To Donald Trump  Five million dollars  If he will come  That he can donate  To a charity of his choice  The charity of his choice 
[03:00:30]  Hair club for men  Right  The institute for  Incorrigible douchebaggery  Whatever  Right  Charity  So, you know  Obviously I had fun with that on Leno  And then  Donald Trump  Basically  Said  Hey  Donald Trump got his birth certificate  And got his lawyers involved  And listed all the charities  That he wants the money to go to  On his Twitter  Yep  He's now calling up  Bill Maher going  Alright  I'll take your bet  There's your offer  Here's my response to it  Here's a birth certificate  Here's all kinds of legal documents 
[03:01:00]  To prove that my father  Yeah  Is indeed not an orangutan  Yeah, he had lawyers  Draw up some documents  And everything  You got some of those tweets there  Saying that were going viral yesterday  Uh, yeah  Uh, lawyers have sent Bill Maher  Demand notice  And necessary documentation  I have accepted Bill Maher's  Five million dollar offer  Paid to me for charity  Made on the Jay Leno show  American Cancer Society  And, oh  The charities I have designated  For Bill Maher's donations  Are 
[03:01:30]  Police Athletic League New York  March of Dimes  Hurricane Sandy Victims  American Cancer Society  And the Dana Farberg Cancer Center  I hope Bill Maher pays quickly  So that this money can be  Immediately given  To the charities  Wow  Oh boy  Now I wonder  Uh, legally  If Bill Maher's  In a little bind here  No  Not even a little  Not even a little  You don't think?  No  I think you could tell  That that was spoof  That's not a binding contract  Uh, if you sit there  On Leno's couch  And you say douchebaggery 
[03:02:00]  It's no way  Uh, five million dollars  Hey  Yeah  Sam, I'll give you  Five million dollars  Yeah  If you can prove  Mm-hmm  That I had sex  With your wife  Tomorrow  Eh  By tomorrow?  Yes  No, I'd have to have  Sex with her tomorrow  Oh  And if Sam can prove  You'll give him five million  It's like  It's like  Um, that fucking  This is quite an  Indecent proposal  Yes, it is  Oh my god  My god  You wouldn't 
[03:02:30]  You wouldn't  Entertain that offer  Would you?  Entertain it  Or accept it  Five million  Five million  Five million dollars  But he'd have to make her  What they call  A three-holer  Oh god  What they do  In their private time  Is there  He'd have to initiate her  Into the three-hole club  Oh  Would you give your wife  Up for five million dollars?  Fuck yeah  Today?  For one fuck?  Yeah, who cares? 
[03:03:00]  One night  Five million bucks  I'd let her fuck  Magic Johnson  For five million dollars  Wow  Tax-free?  Who cares?  Or you will pay the tax on it  I gotta pay tax on it too  Wow, that's a lot of money  Now we're talking more like  Seven and a half  Eight million  You're  You're fucking  I love how he's just thinking  The tax angle  And nothing about the  Moral  Ethical implications  Do I get five million in my hand  Or do I get two  Let's say you get five million  Clear  In hand  Five million clear  For a night of  Physical 
[03:03:30]  Shenanigans  Shenanigans with your wife  Which can include anything  You know  That I would please  Yeah  Does Sam get to watch?  No  How about if he has to have sex with her  Like the anal scene  In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  Again  It's up to them  Right  I would have the conversation with Jess  At that point I think  What do you think she'd say?  You can't have the conversation with her  You gotta make the decision  No rubber of course  Again  That's up to them  That's not up to me  But I would  I would  Explain the offer  And say you know 
[03:04:00]  I was thinking about  Starting a family  You want to  Have a house  You don't want this  One bedroom forever  You'd get a great house  I got that big green screen  That's not fitting anywhere  Around here  That's true  You know  That stupid green screen of yours  So maybe  This could be a good idea  Would you  Oh wow  Would it bother you  Like it bothered  Woody Harrelson  I mean yeah  It would probably bother me  He'd be banging on the door  Is that how that went down?  Yeah yeah  He just ran to the boat dock 
[03:04:30]  And they're already gone  Yeah Woody Harrelson  And fucking Demi  And then she asked  He asked her how it was  And she said it was good  Yeah  He didn't want to hear that shit  Was it a good movie?  I don't remember  Yeah it was alright  And then she starts dating  The billionaire  Yeah  Because Woody fucks her over  Because Woody was like  Fucking he couldn't  He couldn't handle it  Do they get together  In the end?
