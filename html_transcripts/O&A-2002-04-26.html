<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the announcement that Brian Regan would be a guest the following Friday.  A large gift from WJFK in Washington D.C., initially believed to contain live crabs, was revealed to be stone crabs and key lime pie.  A radio dispatcher then informed them of "Stalker Patty's" hospital discharge.  The hosts subsequently discussed the death of Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, sparking a heated argument with a caller, Cheryl, who criticized their insensitive car crash sound effects.  The conversation shifted to Linda Lovelace's death and her family's financial struggles.  Opie and Anthony attempted to contact her sister, Barbara Borman, to offer financial aid, ultimately obtaining bank details for a fund for Lovelace's grandchildren.  Future guests Chris Titus and Dice, and sponsors Stacker 2 and Sam Adams beer, were promoted.  Barry Williams (Greg Brady) called in briefly, with the hosts avoiding any *Brady Bunch* references.

The show continued with Barry Williams discussing his upcoming celebrity boxing matches, potentially involving Joey Buttafuoco and John Wayne Bobbitt.  Repeated attempts to reach Dice were unsuccessful due to his emotional distress after visiting Ground Zero.  A 14-year-old girl, Amber, from Texas, detailed disturbing allegations of assault by a 97-year-old and a 43-year-old man, and CD theft.  The hosts, expressing concern, guided her towards a rape hotline.  Chris Titus, in studio, shared stories about his upbringing and Fox show.  Calls from a pilot with engine trouble and "Stalker Patty" (regarding her foot surgery) also occurred.  Highly offensive language and sexually explicit humor permeated this segment.  Numerous angry "F.U." messages targeted the Philadelphia Flyers and Buffalo Bills.

A significant portion focused on a bizarre phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, claiming to be at Ground Zero with NYPD officers and a Salvation Army lieutenant.  The hosts questioned his motives, suspecting publicity-seeking.  The conversation became increasingly erratic and incoherent, leading to speculation of a nervous breakdown.  "Happy Face" acted as an intermediary, and calls from Barry Williams and Christopher Titus (in studio) occurred.  The discussion touched upon the 9/11 aftermath, comparing New York and Los Angeles work ethics and criticizing those seeking media attention after the tragedy.  Jimmy Norton's call provided comedic relief.  The segment concluded with reflections on Dice's meltdown and Norton's stories.

A later segment featured a discussion with actor Rick about his extra role in a *Beverly Hills 90210* gay coffeehouse scene.  Audio from the episode was played, highlighting Rick's minimal screen time and lack of dialogue.  The hosts humorously speculated on his character's "playing it gay".  The conversation included tangents: a discussion about a previous trip to Los Angeles where they met Dice; listener calls about Rick's other roles (speculation about *Police Academy* and *Less Than Zero*); and numerous "F.U." messages.  Christopher Titus was mentioned as a recent guest, and Maury Povich was announced as an upcoming guest.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn?" segment and thanks to Barry Williams.  Dice's Ground Zero visit was also mentioned.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used highly offensive language and engaged in vulgar and sexually explicit humor.

[00:01:00]  Cancel your appointments!  Howdy!  Baggins!  Okay, pookie.  Now we're having fun.  All right, all right, all right, we're here. 
[00:01:30]  Well, we're waiting.  How you guys doing?  Doing all right, Tom.  Thanks for asking.  The ratings for New Orleans will come out, I think, next week.  Next week?  We'll see.  Well, I'm sure they're through the roof with the likes of Tom at the helm.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Right. 
[00:02:00]  That's for New York City and the surrounding areas.  Yeah.  And everyone else, including, excuse me, Columbus.  Columbus.  We haven't forgotten about Columbus.  Of course not.  We're on the Big Wazoo in Columbus.  The Big Wazoo!  They can use 866-277-4WOW.  Columbus and everyone else that is listening to us outside of the New York area.  866-277-4WOW.  The Big Wazoo, Opie. 
[00:02:30]  The Big Wazoo.  What a great name for a station.  We went up in the ratings in Columbus.  Yes.  We did very well in Columbus.  Thank you, Columbus.  And thank you, Washington.  They sent us a nice gift.  I am...  We don't know what it is, but thank you.  Congratulations.  Opie and Anthony, congratulations on your terrific winter book ratings.  This is for Washington DC.  We know the best is yet to come. 
[00:03:00]  We look forward to welcoming you both to Washington and WJFK on May 10th.  Yeah, we'll be there May 10th.  All our best.  Two weeks from today, I believe, right?  Alan and the entire staff there at WJFK.  Isn't that great?  Thank you, Alan.  Thank you, everyone.  What is it?  We don't know.  It's a box with stuff in it.  With stuff in it.  I call it box of stuff.  I don't know.  It was hand-trucked in here.  That's good stuff. 
[00:03:30]  What is it?  No.  We don't even know what it is.  I don't know.  They sent us crabs?  Dude, it's from Joe's Crab in Miami.  That place is legendary.  Nice.  So Washington sent us crabs from Miami?  Yeah.  Couldn't we get crabs on our own?  No.  Some of us easier than others.  Yes.  Are they prepared?  They're just two big boxes.  How big is the crab inside?  They're a great crab place.  They probably sent a bunch of crab. 
[00:04:00]  Are they like...  What are we going to do?  Are we supposed to cook them?  Yeah.  How is it?  Open that up.  And let me see what type of crab...  Rick, carry one of those boxes all the way over to Anthony.  Yeah.  That's good.  We got two huge boxes.  Rick actually bringing it over here.  You can...  I think I hear something moving.  There's no way there's...  No, there's stuff moving in here.  They are live crabs.  They're not live.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me hear. 
[00:04:30]  Let me hear.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're not live.  Let me pick it up.  I think you're out of your mind.  Let me pick it up now.  Listen.  You guys are insane.  Perishable.  This side up.  Open it up.  He's hearing live crabs in the box.  That is a huge box.  What are we going to do with live crabs? 
[00:05:00]  And there's two of these?  What are we going to do?  You're going to take it on the subway?  That's the best.  All right.  There's a styrofoam cooler inside.  Oh, my God.  This is what was moving around.  Of course.  A cutting board or something.  Let's see a lid on this.  Here.  Get a mic because this is too good.  Get a mic on, Anthony.  All right.  Here we go.  Rick, if you could somehow get that cutting board off of here and then get the  styrofoam top off, we'll see what this is all about.  All right.  We're going to throw this. 
[00:05:30]  We're going to keep your chin up.  We're going to throw this.  Put it right up there.  There we go.  I see forks and bibs in there.  We're very appreciative, but is it tape?  Are they cooked up?  All right.  All right.  We have it up.  Boy, there's a lot of layers to get through.  This is key lime pie.  It's key lime pie.  It's not even crabs.  Key lime pie.  What is that about?  But there's another box down in here. 
[00:06:00]  Dry ice.  Let's have fun with the dry ice.  All right.  So what do we got so far?  We got some pie?  A pie, Opie.  Okay.  A key lime pie.  All right.  All right.  Rick, what is that?  The box is huge.  It has everything.  This has some plastic containers, and it looks...  What the hell is that?  What are they?  It's green.  Hold on.  Open this up.  See if you can open that.  I think you need bolt cutters.  Yeah, we need something to cut this up.  But we have a little hammer. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I know.  Get Pete.  That you're supposed to use for cracking the shell of the crab.  I bet you the crabs are in there.  Well, open up that other box.  Get me a crab.  I want crabs.  You sure?  Yeah.  All right.  That's another real big, heavy box that's making its way to Anthony.  All right.  That looks like some kind of condiment, perhaps.  Yeah.  Some type of condiment in this box. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Now, this one is...  What is it?  What is this?  No one knows what it is.  More stuff.  Oh, is there a crab?  Okay.  I see a crab.  All right.  You see a crab, finally?  It's dead.  Jesus.  A source.  They're dead.  How are we supposed to eat it?  Are there instructions with this?  You need instructions with your...  All right.  We got bolt cutters.  We're getting deeper into one of the other boxes.  Hey, where did you get those from? 
[00:07:30]  Pete Johnson.  I keep these around.  Stalker Patty's in an ambulance?  John, what's going on?  No, what's up?  Hey.  What's going on?  Well, you tell us.  Well, the word on the street is in about 20 minutes, we're supposed to be picking up  Stalker Patty from Long Beach Medical Center on Long Island.  Why?  She's being discharged, going back to her home in Staten Island.  Did she get her other foot done? 
[00:08:00]  That's the word on the street.  All right.  Well, give us a call when you pick her up, okay?  All right.  No doubt.  I'll give you a call in like 25 minutes.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Could someone explain what the hell all this stuff is?  We're very appreciative by this fine gift, but you guys are opening up containers and  looking at it like you've never seen it before.  Yeah.  I don't know what that is.  What is that now?  Looks like spinach.  Some kind of type of spinach.  Now everything is dripping all over the studio.  What is that?  Like there's how many of these are there? 
[00:08:30]  Like half a dozen.  There's like half a dozen of those and I don't know what they are.  Are we supposed to cook this?  There's a lot of work to this gift.  Man, Philly gave us some dong.  Well, I'll open up the crab part and maybe get a claw out or something.  What's that?  All right.  This guy.  Tomato and cabbage.  The phones are in the wrong order, by the way.  Neil, what's up?  Hey, guys.  This is from Joe's Stone Crab down in Miami. 
[00:09:00]  Those are stone crabs.  They're already cooked.  They're a delicacy.  They're very good.  Okay.  That's a mustard dipping sauce.  All you do is yank the meat out of the crab.  Legs.  And that's it.  You don't get crab bodies or nothing.  It's just the claws, boys.  Just the claws.  And we're good to go?  We don't have to like heat it up or anything?  Nothing to do with it.  You actually do eat them cold usually.  Oh, now we're getting to the...  Like a shrimp cocktail.  We just got to...  Absolutely.  We just got to the claws and they look very, very appetizing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They should be a reddish orange with some black suckles on them. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I worked in Miami years ago.  I get down there.  It's a seasonal thing.  And all they feed you is the actual claw from the crab.  Well, let's...  That's great.  Nice gift.  Enjoy them, boys.  Thank you.  Congrats on the ratings.  Carry on.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you, Neil.  Frank from Manhattan.  O&A.  Joe's stone crabs are very, very good.  It costs a fortune to send this stuff, by the way.  And if Don Geronimo had anything to do with this, they're probably poisoned.  Beware.  Frank.  I don't think... 
[00:10:00]  Frank, stop it.  I don't believe anybody's being poisoned.  No, we'll be fine.  Now, we're going to set up this whole mess in the studio, right?  We'll have a little crab...  I don't know.  A little buffet.  A little buffet.  Right?  You don't have to cook it.  No, the guy said you don't have to cook it.  No, no.  You just got to crack them.  Just leave them there.  Where's Mary?  Have Mary take care of this.  Mary will set it up all nice.  Get a little table.  Mary, set this up all nice.  Get the crabs, the dipping sauce. 
[00:10:30]  Mm-hmm.  We got the little hammer to break open the shells.  And Ernie O's saying, did that last guy actually say, word on the street?  Word on the street.  Word on the street isn't that bad yet.  No?  It sounds like an old 40s movie.  Yeah.  Film noir.  All right.  Word on the street.  Fabio.  Yo.  What's up, Fabio?  I don't know if this is a sucks to be you or unlucky lottery, but I think it's just bad karma.  Why?  No, you burn down your man's house, and I'll make that mansion, because you're pissed at 
[00:11:00]  him.  Yeah.  Then, you know, a few years later, halfway around the world, seven people in a car, six  people escape uninjured, and you die.  Huh.  Yeah, you're talking about left eye.  Left eye.  Left eye.  It's right after she signs with Suge Knight.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  That's bad karma.  Hmm.  I haven't heard it.  Yeah, I'm kind of pissed off that none of the radio...  Never mind.  You know, I don't think the stations are giving her her due. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  A lot of people enjoyed her music, as did Opie and I.  I just need a place that I feel like I could go and go in with my fellow...  Should we play a song?  TLC fans, should we play a song?  Yes.  All right.  VH1.  VH1 should have been called TLC this morning.  Cool.  Thank you, Fabio.  Hey, did you know if they're tired, Blue Owl?  Why?  What are you going to say?  Oh, because, uh, speaking of Blowouts, that's my band, and we're playing tonight in  Oklahoma's side of Calico Jack.  Wow.  Very good.  Very Norton-esque. 
[00:12:00]  I was going to say, you must be a huge fan of Jim Norton.  I just hope, uh, the Islanders don't on.  Hey, relax with the Islanders.  We're doing fine.  Yeah, no, they're doing some good.  We're all going to be at the Coliseum for Sunday night's game, Anthony.  Can't wait to go!  Big, huge party in the parking lot, by the way, starting at 3 o'clock before the Islanders  game Sunday.  I will be there.  You're talking over the music.  All right, you can start that over again.  Nah, the intro's so long.  No, here, start it up again as I do my big Islander push here.  Wow.  Sunday's game, 8 o'clock. 
[00:12:30]  We're all going.  Yeah.  It's going to be another whiteout, Anthony.  Oh, what?  Oh, the Islanders personally called me and told me, make sure everyone is wearing white  Sunday for the game.  Really?  So far, everyone's been doing a great job with that at the home games, but they're looking  for a complete whiteout inside the Coliseum Sunday.  Huge party before the game, starting at 3.  I'll be cruising around the parking lot having some fun, man.  Right.  All right?  Somebody looking to ruin a good gift sent the price list from Joe's. 
[00:13:00]  Is that dinner for...  You're talking over the intro.  I'm sorry, I don't care about the left eye.  But we were going to do our tribute.  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, you go first, and then we'll try it for the third time.  Go ahead.  Is it dinner for eight?  How many?  How many, like, little spinach thingy, whatever that was, did you say?  Six?  Okay, dinner for six.  And it's the jumbo?  It's got to be the jumbo, dude. 
[00:13:30]  Wow, dude, that's like 706 bucks.  706 bucks.  Nice.  Worth of crabs.  That's good.  Very good.  I'm sorry.  Now, let's get back to left eye.  Yeah, let's start up again.  Oh, a little left eye.  Hold on, we're in the middle of the song now.  The one that didn't sing.  She rapped, right?  Didn't she rap on this?  I think so, Anthony, yes.  No! 
[00:14:00]  All right.  You know what kind of problems you're going to cause with the likes of that?  Oh.  No!  Dude, I guarantee we have a problem because of that.  I guarantee you we're going to have a huge problem because of that.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know how some people can get about their artists? 
[00:14:30]  What did it happen, England?  You know how some people can get.  Remember when somebody made a little off-color joke about, what's her name?  Who was the latter?  Aaliyah.  Remember the problems that caused?  No, I don't remember.  You're going to get the black folk all mad at us.  I was in...  That's not the black folk.  I was in Greece when Aaliyah died.  Yeah?  Radio stations don't speak English over there. 
[00:15:00]  No Ingley?  No!  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  It's all open, my brothers.  My brothers.  It is all open.  What are you talking about?  Oh, falling out of the passenger side of a best friend's ride.  A friend's ride.  Right?  Taking out the passenger side of a best friend's ride. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Well, we'll all miss her wacky hijinks.  She was the loose cannon.  That one.  Burning down her boyfriend's house.  The mansion.  Right?  Ryzen's house.  Stalker Patty.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi.  How you doing?  Well, Anthony, I want to wish you a very happy birthday.  Shut up.  I just got out of foot surgery.  Who needs it?  Who needs it? 
[00:16:00]  Who needs it from you?  Oh, stop.  I just wanted to wish it good.  Patty is so looking to get laid, by the way, open.  Patty, how is it that you know more about us than we know about ourselves?  Yay.  I was...  Well, I didn't even know you were to say, because I didn't even know you were to say.  She told me.  Hello?  Yeah, what, Patty?  Patty!  What?  What are you doing?  I asked her.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm in the hospital. 
[00:16:30]  Patty.  What?  Are you talking to us?  You're on the air.  What are you doing?  What are you doing, you stupid?  I'm not doing anything.  I'm just sitting next to the nurse's station talking on the phone.  No, you're not.  You're talking to other people.  No, I'm not.  Well, something's going on.  They heard of the people on the phone.  Okay.  Oh, my.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  All right.  What were you saying, Anthony?  I forgot now.  How she wants to get laid now?  Yeah.  Patty absolutely wants to get laid now. 
[00:17:00]  She was at the Ron and Fez event last week, and she's wearing little shorts, a little halter top.  She had a clip in her Auschwitz hair, and she was like, I want you guys to set me up on a date.  So she's looking for it.  Finally.  Yeah, she's finally looking for it, and I don't know if we want to do anything like that.  You know, kind of ship her off with some guy.  You know, what would be Patty's type? 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  Maybe a homeless guy.  Yeah, I'm feeling that I need to explore my feminine beauty.  I need to explore my sexuality.  Well, I was a foundling, and now I'm looking to foundling a big C.  Well, maybe.  Well, if she calls back, we'll try to figure it out, I guess.  Yeah, because I really think she's...  That's why she's doing all this, by the way.  She's getting her feet repaired. 
[00:18:00]  She's gussing herself up.  She's wearing makeup.  She's trying to wear better clothes.  And she's looking for a man now.  She wants some of that man meat.  She doesn't want to go to her grave being a 40-whatever-it-is-year-old virgin.  46, I think she is.  Yeah, something like that.  Hey, Cheryl, what's up?  Opie, you know I love you guys, but please don't do that.  Ah, see?  I love you guys, but don't do that, Opie.  Cheryl, it wasn't me, so please don't pull the head off a chicken, do a dance, and make 
[00:18:30]  us drop dead with your voodoo.  When your friend from that band, he died in the hotel or whatever, you came on the air,  you never made fun of it, so don't do it.  Don't do it.  But we like that.  Okay, I love you guys, but Opie, don't do it.  Wow, she's actually getting mad.  Cheryl.  Cheryl, please don't.  Come on, Opie, you know I listen to you guys every day, but don't do it.  It's not funny.  Cheryl, can I ask you something, please?  Yes?  You heard all that.  It was Opie, so don't do any voodoo. 
[00:19:00]  I know you're the nice guy.  Don't do voodoo on me.  Don't do none of your voodoo.  Okay?  If you're going to make a voodoo doll and do all that mumbo-jumbo, maybe get the mojo  out.  Make sure it's Opie, not me.  Opie, be nice.  Don't do it.  Okay?  Were you a big fan of TLC and left eye?  Yes, I am a big fan of them.  Opie, don't do it.  Do you have any left eye memories, Cheryl, that you'd like to share with us?  I don't go chasing waterfalls.  I love that.  You like that?  Did it mean a lot to you when you first heard it? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Were you able to relate?  No, not really.  It should be don't go driving without your seatbelt, huh, Cheryl?  Jesus, what happened?  Okay, I want to speak to Opie.  All right, Opie, Cheryl's on the phone for you, Opie.  Yes, Cheryl?  Don't be a bad boy today.  I'm not.  Yes, you are.  You are mean.  You have been mean all week.  You're going to believe Anthony just because he says I did it?  No, you know what?  Listen to those tapes yesterday.  What you're doing today, you are the one who is always mean. 
[00:20:00]  What tapes?  What's these tapes you speak of?  It's tapes with a little old lady.  Let me tell you something.  Anthony laughed just as hard at that as I did.  I did not.  Yes, you did.  Opie, Anthony did nothing.  You are a creep.  Don't do it.  You're a creep, Opie.  Wait, don't call me a creep because then you're going to...  Okay, well, don't do the bad today.  Don't do it.  I'm actually very sad today.  You're sad or you're being so mean? 
[00:20:30]  No, I'm just sad.  What's making it sad?  That left eye died.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  She was fun.  Wasn't she fun?  Yeah, she was.  What Opie's doing, he's playing car crashes and all of that.  She's crazy, that girl.  She's so crazy.  I wonder if she had her left eye covered.  Oh, jeez.  And that's why she was the only one that died.  Oh, stop it.  Because she had her head sticking out the wrong side of the car.  Oh, stop it.  Who vacations in Honduras, by the way?  Who vacations in Honduras? 
[00:21:00]  Do you know what those roads are like?  People that have accidents in Honduras, it's because they plummet off of cliffs.  Of course, that's what happens.  Trying to avoid chickens in the road.  Big muddy roads on cliffs.  Well, okay, Opie, just be good today and don't do it.  Okay, don't make fun of her there.  I'm not.  Yes, you are.  Hey, you have a kid, Cheryl?  Huh?  You have a kid?  Yes.  Nice.  I didn't know you were a mom.  Yes, I am. 
[00:21:30]  See?  See?  See?  See?  Opie, don't be mean.  You know, I'm not going to sit for this.  You son of a bitch.  No, this is where I draw the line.  You son of a bitch.  This is where I draw the line, Opie.  Opie, you're going to make the brothers mad today.  Exactly.  You son of a bitch, Cheryl.  Oh, Anthony, don't buy his crap today. 
[00:22:00]  Opie, don't do it.  Oh, don't do it.  No, no.  Don't.  I'm begging you, don't.  My hands are on the line.  Anthony's the one.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Anthony always be nice.  Opie, don't.  My hands are up in the air.  See?  That's it.  You son of a bitch.  I've had it.  I've had it.  Cheryl, you've got to believe me.  I did not do that one.  I don't believe you because you'll always be me.  You'll always be me.  Anthony.  Okay, Anthony.  Have a nice weekend, boys.  Opie, I know.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  No!  See?  That's not right.  I did not.  Not right.  I want to go on record and say that I did not do that.  She was beloved by many people, her and her music.  Opie, if you have any compassion, get your finger away from that button.  Get it away.  Get it away.  Get it.  Oh, Jesus.  Keep it away.  You know, you're wrong.  You're just wrong.  My hands are up in the air. 
[00:23:00]  And no one is going to believe me.  Yes, Drew.  Who's the idiot with the sound effects over there?  What's going on?  Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  Opie.  Let me tell you something.  Opie, no backs.  Something's going to happen real soon within a week.  Anthony.  A heck.  Anthony.  A heck.  Today's enough your ratings are going downhill.  Now you've got to play this cup.  They're not going down.  Relax with that.  You guys will be off the air in one year.  One year.  They said that a year ago.  One year, stupid.  They said that two years ago. 
[00:23:30]  And Jim Norton, that guy sucks.  Where is he?  He stinks.  He sucks.  All right, Drew.  Thank you.  Hey, come on.  Fess up that you did some of that.  I did nothing.  I am embarrassed by your behavior.  Javier.  Javier.  Yo, another classic example of comedy gone bad, man.  Gone too far.  That's right, Anthony.  You guys are so wrong.  The body's not even cold.  Even I have a line.  And I think I just found it today.  I can't sit here and watch Opie.  You're such a liar.  Opie. 
[00:24:00]  Someone out there is not buying this, Anthony.  That's what a God, man.  Watch Opie doing this.  You know, it's all fun with the sound effects a lot of times, but not today.  Not on a day like this when we've lost a cherished person in music.  You're such a dick.  Left eye.  You're such a dick.  Little left eye.  You're such a dick.  Opie.  I did not do it, Sean.  Opie, you're a tool, man.  I did not.  Three days ago, you were practically in tears when Lane Staley gets found decomposing in his apartment.  Don't.  You are too much.  Disgusting. 
[00:24:30]  Don't hit the crash.  You're such a tool.  You're so freaking mean.  I am not.  You're going to have to look down there, down protest outside the studio.  I'm not doing this one.  Unbelievable.  I'm not.  You guys suck.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Horrid.  You're an awful man.  You're such a dick.  Despicable.  I am not doing this one.  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday, we heard you tell a child there's no Santa and tell an old lady her best friend was dead. 
[00:25:00]  But, yeah, of course, you're not playing these sound effects.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not.  I'm so not today.  Ben, who's playing the sound effects?  Opie.  You are, Opie.  Thank you, Ben.  That was you.  No, it wasn't.  It was way off mic.  You heard it.  That didn't sound like Ben at all.  Earl's doing it.  Ah.  Like hell I am.  Boy, Mark brings up a good point.  How the hell is Tom Brokaw going to pronounce TLC?  And Lisa Lopez? 
[00:25:30]  Right.  What's her name?  Lopez.  Lisa Left Eye Lopez?  Lisa Left Eye Lopez.  Or is it Lopes?  How do you pronounce it, Earl?  You're a brother.  Is it Lopez?  Or Lopes?  No, it's Lopez.  Lopez?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  A sad day in the entertainment industry as... 
[00:26:00]  Lisa Left Eye Lopez from TLC.  Lopez.  Lopez.  Yeah.  As Lisa Left Eye Lopez from the group TLC died in a car crash in Honduras.  This horrible, beloved singer for TLC is reported the accident happened at 9.15 on a small 
[00:26:30]  road in Honduras.  Lisa Left Eye Lopez died.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  How you doing?  Nick, what's going on, bro?  Yo, guys.  Hey. 
[00:27:00]  First of all, Ope, I love it.  Can I hear it one more time, the sound effect?  No.  Come on, Ope.  I didn't do any of that.  I won't sit here for that anymore.  You're such a dick today.  Anymore.  Did you guys hear what Tom and Mike said about you today?  I'm glad you're not just kowtowing to people, Ope, and playing the sound effects.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  That's not even...  See, no.  That's wrong.  That's not a dick.  That's not a dick.  Yo, did you guys hear what Don and Mike said about you today? 
[00:27:30]  Honestly, no.  I'm sure we'll get accurate information filtered through the listeners.  They always get it right.  They said that you guys basically lied to your fans and that WNEW is doing fine and you're  just blowing it out of proportion and that your fans are just dumb and believe everything  you say.  All right.  All right.  Well, we'll have to wait and see on that one.  I have an official comment that you can then turn around and say to them.  Yeah.  Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  I just say they suck, period. 
[00:28:00]  I want to be mature in my comment and make sure that the listeners get back to them.  Right.  With their accurate information.  Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  That's our official response, right?  We're just going to keep going back and forth.  I want a poof in response to my nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  Let's not be ridiculous, people.  Nick, this place here in New York completely sucks.  That's the reality of it.  And only time will prove us right.  Why listen to you guys on YSP anyway? 
[00:28:30]  Cool.  Thanks, Nick.  All right, man.  Later.  Bye.  We got a show to do.  We can't be bothered with all these things that are surrounding us.  Right.  These things.  Things.  More than one show doing things around us.  All right.  We'll go to the afternoon, Ryan, and we'll continue.  We got lots to do today.  We have Chris Titus coming in today, Anthony.  Yes, Patty back on the phone.  She said she had a crossed line, but now it's fixed. 
[00:29:00]  Well, maybe we'll talk to her.  Also, I think we're going to be hearing from Dice again today.  Barry Williams wants to pitch Dice on the next celebrity boxing thing they're going to be doing for Fox.  Oh, really?  They're doing another one of those?  Do they have anybody else in the lineup already?  I think they want Dice to fight a girl.  Okay.  I could do that.  Yeah, so we'll get into that in a little bit.  Also, we're thinking that we should pay for Linda Lovelace's funeral. 
[00:29:30]  Yes, she's dead.  She's dead, and they don't have enough money to bury her.  If it wasn't for Linda Lovelace and Deep Throat, you wouldn't really know porno.  How did she die, Opie?  No.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, man.  I'm just sitting here behaving.  She died in a car crash?  Is that what you're saying?  I don't need your help.  People already know I'm a douche.  Stop.  Please. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  I do it to myself.  I really enjoy the music.  All right.  I'll get off the subject.  I really don't need your help.  People already know I'm an idiot.  Okay.  I'll change the subject.  I truly enjoy the music of Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Jesus Christ, Opie.  Enough.  Hey, now you've gone too far.  I've gone too far?  Oh, my God, yes.  I love Stevie Ray Vaughan's music.  Well, then you should probably not do that.  Couldn't stand the weather.  I mean, come on.  All right.  Forget about it.  Don't even mess with Kurt Cobain. 
[00:30:30]  I'm sorry.  I didn't say that.  Mother effort.  Oh, please.  Could we just stop doing that?  Oh, Opie.  You know, Opie, Randy Rose was a great, great...  Dude, stop.  And I...  Oh, Christ.  You got it.  Enough already.  Stop.  Jesus.  Harry Chapin was a wonderful, wonderful singer. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, no.  What happened?  Christopher Reeve.  Yes.  One of my favorite...  What happened?  Hit an explosive tree?  It's alive.  Will you stop?  Okay.  People already know I'm a dick.  They don't need your help.  All right.  We'll talk about the news.  Is that Andrea Yates?  Yeah.  With her children?  It's just an awful, awful thing to have to deal with.  Why? 
[00:31:30]  Opie.  Enough already.  Please.  My God.  Whew.  Well.  Stop, Anthony.  I don't get it.  Please.  Lane Staley.  Just wonderful.  Wonderful.  What do you do about Lane Staley?  What?  What?  What was that?  I don't know.  You're playing it.  I'm not playing this stuff!  Holy mess. 
[00:32:00]  You know, the Grucci family was wonderful when they had their, oh my God, and then something  happened out on Long Island, a little explosion 10, 15 years ago.  I didn't think you'd remember that, Opie.  I don't.  You're the one with the memory.  I can't remember what I did yesterday.  Everyone knows that.  I don't.  Stop.  I don't know.  You know, the, uh, the tuberculosis epidemic. 
[00:32:30]  And don't be stupid.  Epidemic.  Yeah.  If the cough was actually a cough instead of dice, it would have been great.  Jesus Christ, why is that on my number one channel?  On yours, right?  You said yours, right?  I mean, Opie, why is that on?  You said yours!  Damn it!  Damn it!  Confess!  Damn it!  All right.  Enough. 
[00:33:00]  We also have Rick's, uh...  Opie doesn't have skiing sounds.  Someone says, what happened to Sonny Bono?  Forget it, Rick.  All right.  All right, stop.  Wonderful.  Stop.  Well, uh, we have Rick's 90210, uh, tape when he was an extra.  Thank God we're finally getting to that.  Maybe we could do that, uh, right away, because people have been waiting for that one, Anthony.  Yes.  And there's a few other things, but I, I, I, I'm forgetting right now, so. 
[00:33:30]  We'll make it up as we go along, as we do every day, so.  Mm-hmm.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I like to give a big F.U. out to all you people, but don't get out of the way for fire trucks.  You know the big red f***ing machines with big f***ing red lights on it?  You're supposed to move over to the right side so we can get past you, okay?  There's people out there with problems, unlike you, you ass.  Go f*** yourself. 
[00:34:00]  Next message.  Hey, I want to leave a big F.U. for the crook doctor and the f***ing hospital that feel the need to charge me 500 goddamn dollars for a f***ing tetanus shot.  $2.50 for the f***ing hospital and $2.50 for the f***ing crook doctor that I didn't even f***ing see because a stupid nurse gave me the f***ing shot.  F*** you.  I ain't paying it.  Next message.  Here's the big F.U. to the goddamn pool that's driving this semi from Michigan. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, F.U. range.  It ain't a public parking spot.  It's a street in Manhattan.  This is my loading zone.  Move your goddamn semi.  F.U.  End of messages.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  Ah, what goes well with crabs, Anthony?  Ah, we're going to find a salve and a razor?  No. 
[00:35:00]  No.  Sam Adams.  That's what I'm going to have.  A match?  You've got to chase him out of the forest.  Right.  That old gag.  No, we're talking about Sam Adams.  Yes.  When we crack open some of these lovely crab claws sent to us from the fine people in Washington at WJFK,  I'm going to be washing mine down with some Sam Adams lager.  Mmm, mmm.  We love it.  Trade up.  A lot more people enjoying the Sam Adams these days.  They're tired of watered-down beer. 
[00:35:30]  Sam's got that great taste.  Real beer.  None of that fake beer.  Real great American beer.  So, uh, I'm going to be enjoying it.  You're going out to the bar, pick up, uh, get some Sam.  Going to the store, pick up some Sam for the house.  You'll impress your guests with a great American beer.  Sam Adams.  Hey, hey, hey!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, American Badass. 
[00:36:00]  Kid Rock, our buddy, our pal.  Our latest interview with Kid Rock, I think we're going to replay that here in New York tomorrow afternoon.  Yes.  Sorry to everybody else, I missed it, but we do a best of in New York on Saturdays from 3 to 7.  Yes, part of that will be the Kid Rock interview.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including Buffalo, New York, Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Ah, Buffalo.  Little Jimmy Norton playing Buffalo tonight.  He should be checking in soon.  You can use 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  I want to thank the two toll collectors outside of Buffalo that put the nice WOW stickers right on the toll boots for us.  Yeah.  That is huge advertising as far as the show goes and as far as WOW goes, and we love seeing that.  So, thank you.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Buffalo.  I think it's down near Lackawanna. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  Oh, what happened to my music?  We were jamming, man.  We were rocking.  I like that.  Anthony, breaking news.  We got Linda Lovelace's daughter.  Daughter?  No.  Sister.  I'm sorry.  Sister on the phone.  Barbara Borman.  There's a very tragic story in the New York papers about Linda Lovelace, right?  Yeah.  She died.  She died, which is very sad.  Mm-hmm.  We're huge fans of porno.  I know.  Stop it.  Well, I know later in life, I know the whole story.  We'll get into it with Linda Lovelace's sister. 
[00:37:30]  You know, later on in life, she didn't want anything to do with that.  Absolutely.  We understand all that.  Even at the time, it seems that, you know, there were things going on that she wasn't  very happy with what she was doing.  Right.  Well, the papers are reporting that they don't have enough money to bury Linda Lovelace.  Yeah.  Oh, she hung up.  See?  Because I said something stupid, right?  See?  I knew it, Opie.  Oh.  What did I say?  You can't say we're big fans of porno.  I knew she would hang up.  Very sensitive about that. 
[00:38:00]  Very.  But then I, like, kind of aggressive myself real fast.  No, no.  That was enough.  Oh.  The way that family is, and the sister, forget about it.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you...  Oh.  Oh.  I knew it.  That's why I was completely, like, playing, like, forgetting.  What do we do our little trick that we do?  I don't know.  Why don't we do the little trick thing?  Oh, boy.  Rick's trying to get her back on the phone.  That ain't gonna work. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  The big one that got away.  Oh.  The big one that got away.  Oh.  We were gonna pay for a funeral, man.  I know.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus.  Well, let's just wait.  Oh, wait.  She's back.  Barbara.  Barbara?  Hello.  Hi.  Are you mad at us?  I am not interested in speaking about Linda Lovelace and the pornography. 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Well, I heard a little laugh, and it upsets me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There was no one laughing.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, we laugh at stupid things, but we weren't laughing.  No, nothing like that.  I'm very familiar with the story, as a matter of fact.  We were just trying to explain to people who she was.  That's all.  Yeah.  We understand the family's stance on this whole thing.  That she was basically assaulted.  That's how that...  Got that right.  What that amounted to.  The woman did not want to do this, and she was taken advantage of and spent the rest of 
[00:39:30]  her life as an advocate for people put in the same situation.  Yes, she did.  And now, she just recently died on Monday, I guess.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  And it was three weeks after a car accident.  She had a horrific car accident.  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  It seems like, I think, a tie rod...  It's under investigation.  It seems that I was told that the tie rod broke, and her seatbelt broke.  The car rolled over three or four times, and she was thrown about 38 feet out of the windshield. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, Jesus.  She broke both legs, shattered elbow, and pelvis was broken.  Now, she was in, I guess, financial straits here, it seems...  She died penniless.  Penniless.  So, um...  And if you would like to have people send to a fund that's being sent up for her...  Yeah.  I can give you that information.  Well, how much does a funeral cost? 
[00:40:30]  How much have they...  I have no idea.  You have no idea?  No.  It is?  Well, aren't you guys burying her tomorrow?  Tomorrow is her funeral.  She's being cremated.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  And what do you need money for?  Because we would like to...  It's not me.  It's what's been set up for her grandchildren.  Oh.  Oh, see, it sounded like they...  Because we're reading, Linda Lovelace, kin, can't afford her burial.  Well, my father's out there to help her.  Oh, okay. 
[00:41:00]  Well, we kind of wanted to pay for the funeral for the gal.  Well, that's pretty darn nice.  Well, so you have enough money to bury her?  Honey, I'm in Florida.  I don't...  I'm not there, and I don't want to go there.  Oh, why not?  Because I'd rather remember the way she was, and the wonderful times we had together.  My father is there.  And her son is coming home.  He's due in tonight.  He's in the National Guard.  Oh. 
[00:41:30]  Dominic.  And his daughter is there, too.  Oh.  I mean, her daughter.  Is it that you don't have the means to go, or you just would rather not go?  Both.  You know, it's pretty expensive to go out, and I'm just going to stay home and grieve with myself.  There you go.  Do you...  In my heart, I feel better right here.  Do you have any...  Has anyone had any contact with that first husband of hers? 
[00:42:00]  What, that idiot?  Yeah.  Chuck Traynor?  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  No one has had any contact with her.  No one?  And no one is trying to...  He hasn't tried to contact anybody now that she's died?  I'm sure not.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Any memories of Linda Lovelace you'd like to share with our audience this afternoon, Barbara?  As my younger sister, she was my baby doll.  I was 16 when she was born.  She was a beautiful little girl.  A very happy little girl. 
[00:42:30]  And then all hell broke loose.  But she and I were always very close.  Yeah.  And I wish to remember those memories of that.  Yep.  And I can give you an answer to school out there.  Want to help with expenses or what?  Yeah, we would like to do something nice for Linda Lovelace.  Opie.  Yes.  We would. 
[00:43:00]  So what is...  A fund is being set up.  Yes.  And this fund is for?  Uh, Linda Lovelace Memorial Fund is going to be set up in lieu of flowers into an account for her grandchildren's college fund.  Right.  And, uh, uh, well, now here's another tip here.  Her funeral expenses are being covered. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, oh, they are.  They are.  They are.  Uh, I'm just reading my notes from her sister-in-law.  Uh, her first, um...  Yeah.  Let me call it check.  Oh, good.  So...  She was on disability and it came the day after she died.  But anyway, she has a sister-in-law out there who's, um, handling all of this and doing very well.  But she has said that people are calling her and wanting to donate and so on.  Yeah.  So, if you want to, I'll give you the account number, the name of the bank... 
[00:44:00]  Well, we shouldn't, uh, you know, have that kind of information, uh, put out on the air, I don't think.  But is there a phone number, perhaps, or, uh, somewhere where people might be able to get in touch and send a donation?  Are you, are you okay?  You can send a donation to me and I can forward it.  Okay.  If you want to, that's entirely up to you.  Right.  Well, um...  I can give you the... 
[00:44:30]  The name of the bank.  The name of the bank.  Yeah, let's, uh, let's, uh, give out the name of the bank.  Like, uh, if you're just tuning in, Linda Lovelace, um, uh, died tragically in a car accident on Monday.  Yeah, and we're just, uh, there's a fund.  And we got Barbara on the phone.  Her, uh...  Yeah.  Her loving sister.  You're, you're the older sister?  Yes, I am.  Ah.  And we lost another 14 years ago.  Anyway, are you ready for this?  Uh, yes, yes.  All right.  Andrew, you owe me a thousand.  Yes. 
[00:45:00]  It's Wells Fargo Bank.  Okay.  Five-O-Five-O.  Yeah.  South Federal Boulevard.  Mm-hmm.  Englewood, Colorado.  Okay.  Eight-zero-one-one-zero.  And...  Barbara, you all right?  I'm right, yeah.  Cindy, where's the account number?  Is this it?  Yes.  Okay.  The account number is 8-6-1.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:45:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Uh, the account number is...  Now I'm a little confused.  I gave you the name of the Wells Fargo Bank.  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  There is an account number.  Oh, account number, so, okay.  All right, can we have that account number now?  Sure.  8-6-1.  8-3-2.  8-8-3-2.  Oh, Hunter.  Oh, yeah, give it to you.  And I want to thank everybody from coast to coast, north and south, for Paul here, and 
[00:46:00]  you'll send their condolences.  Right.  And she was a lovely girl.  I bet, Barbara.  Well, thank you so much for spending a few minutes with us today.  Thank you.  And, uh, giving us a little, uh, remembrance of Linda and, um...  When she was advocating, I wish you could have heard her speeches.  They were unbelievable.  Yeah.  And she did a great job.  Mm, stick it in my mouth.  You know.  Yeah.  She'll be a legend.  Hoosah!  I bet.  I bet. 
[00:46:30]  Well, uh, best of luck to you, Barbara.  Thank you very much.  I think Barbara really needs to give out that account number again.  Do you think...  Do we get it?  Uh, just, uh, the account number once again.  I'm sorry, Barbara.  That's okay.  8-6-1.  8-3-2.  8-8-3-8.  Penises!  Okay.  Thank you very much, Barbara.  Okay.  Thank you for calling.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There she goes. 
[00:47:00]  Where do I hand in my, um, membership card to the human race?  Do I...  Do I just burn it, or do I have to turn it back in?  Do I have to turn it in?  Do I have to give it to somebody?  Or do I just wait for it to expire?  Holy Jesus!  Oh, my God.  Whew.  That was, uh, awful.  Uh, Bobo, yes. 
[00:47:30]  Bobo?  Guys.  Yes, Bobo.  How do you do that?  How does she not hang up the phone on you?  Oh, my God.  How does she...  Does she hear what's going on?  Uh, obviously not.  Maybe her hearing's a little bad today.  Hey, on the cringe list?  Yeah.  That might be up there in the top three.  I put, uh, Ruth Buzzy right behind that.  And then, uh, the car crash, but...  Oh.  Now, how does she not hang up the phone?  Aw, Paul!  All right, Bobo. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you.  Later.  That was, uh, very tragic.  Uh, Richie, what's up?  Hello?  Hey.  Yeah, listen, did she get disability for Lockjaw?  All right.  Look, look.  Oh, God.  Barbara doesn't want her sister remembered in this life.  Right.  It's not Linda Lovelace.  It was Linda Borman, and, uh, you know, she doesn't want her remembered in that life.  That's why she hung up so quickly when Opie even brought up the porno at the beginning  of the, um...  And, um, she called back.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just not, um, not right.  That wasn't good.  No.  Well, I hope a lot of our listeners will send money, at least.  Yeah.  I don't know if I could even recover from her.  That poor woman.  I feel awful. 
[00:49:00]  But...  Uh, the callers are just horrifying.  Yeah.  All right.  I think she thought I was, uh, upset or crying at one point, because I was making sounds  like...  I couldn't take it anymore.  It's always a surprise which sound clips you'll come up with, and which ones are sitting over 
[00:49:30]  here, and...  Man, I'm not doing anything wrong today.  Yes?  Huh?  What?  There's something wrong with you today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Bill, what's up?  Okay.  I, um...  But I was just hoping that, uh, we could pay for the funeral.  But apparently that's all been taken care of, hoping.  Seems like everyone loves us today.  Woo!  Uh, Mark, what's going on?  Mark!  Mark!  Anything wrong with the phone? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, maybe you gotta do something again?  Oh, I don't have to do anything, Ant?  Is it A or B that you gotta screw with?  Maybe.  Everything is all...  People are there?  They're there.  I think they're just...  Take another call, maybe.  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, listen, I want to make a donation.  Uh, I feel so touched, uh, by all the movies I've seen.  Yeah.  But the sperm bank closed, and I can't get in there until months...  All right.  Okay.  No, no.  All right.  That's all right.  Hey, uh, Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady.  What's going on? 
[00:50:30]  Oh!  Hey, good afternoon.  You know, I think we all owe a great debt to Linda Lovelace.  Exactly!  And I think we should do everything we can to support her.  I mean, those of us that were, you know, coming up into the age of wisdom in the 70s,  and, boy, they took us...  She took us right to where we wanted to go.  Well, Deep Throat was 1972, Barry, and, uh, how old were you in 72?  12.  You were doing the Brady Bunch then?  Yeah, I was 15, I guess.  Um, 16.  The, uh, the cool thing for me, when I saw that movie, I saw it with the co-hit, uh, 
[00:51:00]  Behind the Green Door.  Behind the Green Door, of course.  Of course.  Marilyn Chambers.  Marilyn Chambers.  Hey, Barry, um, we're going to call you back, because we've got to take a quick break.  All right.  Yeah, okay, I'll be around.  I just didn't want you to go anywhere, so we wanted to pick you up real fast.  I'll sit here and hold myself.  You can either stay on hold, or we'll just call you back.  All right.  All right, hold on.  Rick will figure it out for us.  Okay.  Yeah, get Barry on there.  Make sure he calls back, or we call him back.  Yeah, and I think we need to regroup.  What?  We do?  What? 
[00:51:30]  Who pissed you off today?  No one.  That was really good.  I don't know why I'm so entertained by stuff like that, because it is so completely horrific  and horrible.  I don't know.

[00:53:00]  Chris Tite is coming in in about 15 minutes.  Roy!  We got Dice probably stopping by or calling in.  We got Rick's tape to play.  We did the Linda Lovelace thing.  We could throw that away.  That's our, um, I think that's our public service. 
[00:53:30]  Our good deed for the day.  Well, we just got to give out, you know, where you could send donations.  What?  What?  I thought we did good.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams, of course.  You remember him as Greg Brady.  And who doesn't?  God, I always love it when you introduce me that way.  It gives me identity.  I was trying to think of something else.  Is there another way we could introduce you, Barry? 
[00:54:00]  That has nothing to do with the Brady bunch.  Like, I know, uh, like, Jan, she did some, uh, other things.  Jan.  So many other things that you remember her real name.  Eve.  Eve Plum.  She was in that after school special.  Oh, the movie.  Dawn, Portrait of a Teenage Runaway.  Yes.  I love that thing.  Isn't that good?  Yeah.  See, Linda Lovelace started that one off, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Portrait of a teen.  She became a, uh, a teenage prostitute. 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  Didn't, uh, Eve Plum go into a prostitution after that?  No?  No, that wasn't Eve.  Damn it.  Was there something else, Barry?  So, uh, that she did?  No, you.  Oh.  And I, I'm not even, uh, trying to make fun of you.  I remember it.  I mean, Dragnet, weren't you in an episode of Dragnet?  I've done a lot of television.  Yeah.  You know what?  No, no, no, no, no.  Barry, what is the second thing you're known for?  That's all.  Um.  If you had a say.  Right now would be, uh, S Club 7. 
[00:55:00]  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's your band you're pushing.  No, no, no.  That's, I'm just acting on that.  Foxfire, The Fight.  The Fights.  The Fights.  Celebrity Fight.  Yeah, the fighter.  The Butcher.  Barry the Butcher.  Uh, being on your back in the middle of the ring as, uh, Danny Bonavucci's looking over you.  Yeah, last I spoke, we were, I was about to enter the ring, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Uh, that goddamn Danny Partridge there, he packs a mean punch.  Yeah, I wouldn't mess with him.  Let me explain something.  When I got this call to step into the ring, oh, it was going to be so much fun and people 
[00:55:30]  would like it and no one's going to get hurt and you can have all this great equipment on  and, and you know, nobody, it's like a pillow fight.  Yeah.  Not exactly.  Uh, no, no.  And then the reality of it is there's one man beating up another man.  Yeah, like for real.  Did you see the Todd Bridges, uh, Vanilla Ice thing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  That was ridiculous.  At least I went down and got the hell out of there.  Vanilla Ice got his ass handed to him. 
[00:56:00]  Nobody told me Danny was a black belt.  Yeah, yeah, he's a martial artist.  Get on the line now.  Yeah, what's with, um, we're trying to get Dice on the phone and Rick just held up a note.  Give me that note.  Dice doesn't want to go on the air yet.  He's not in frame of mind.  Frame of mind.  And tell that mother effer to get his studded jacketed ass on the phone.  The hell's he thinking?  He's playing the Beacon Theater tonight.  I'm not in the frame of mind.  Well, it took him five minutes to get into the frame of mind in the studio the other day. 
[00:56:30]  He had to get his unlit cigarette just right and his, and his empty ashtray.  See, I, I, I don't smoke the cigarettes, but I have the ashtray.  Because Barry wants to ask, uh, Dice on.  I could shoot him over the Johnny Bravo jacket.  That'll put him in the right frame of mind.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's why we got Barry Williams on the phone today.  Because you're involved with the next celebrity boxing thing, right?  Yeah, I am hanging up my gloves, uh, you know, lest there be any questions.  So what are you going to be doing for celebrity, uh, boxing?  I'm going to do the commentary. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, and a, and a sharp left takes him down to his knees.  Smart, smart man, Barry.  So I'm, so I'm going to try and help put some of these fights together.  You know what's great?  Barry is a goddamn genius.  Because these things are very, very popular.  Hugely popular.  You then align yourself with something big, you're on the episode, and you don't have  to get the crap beat out of you.  Yeah, it's a much smarter way to go.  This, let's, let me tell you who we've got set already.  All right.  Oh, good.  Because, you know, you can't just use any celebrity. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  Hold on, we're going to get another update from Rick.  What, what, what is this?  Hold on, Barry.  I'm sorry.  Rick called Dice back, and he's not in the right frame of mind because he's going down  to ground zero, and, uh, his emotions aren't where they need to be.  Oh, my God.  You know something?  You want to call him?  Call him right here on, on, on the air, because.  Yeah, and I can't believe he's eating up my time, and he's not even on the phone.  I can't believe Dice doesn't want to get your time.  Trust me.  I can't believe he doesn't want to give another plug.  I know.  I'm amazed.  For his show, he's always, uh, clamoring for air time. 
[00:58:00]  Hold on, we're going to hang up on Barry over here.  Maybe, maybe, maybe he'll feel better.  What, he's going to be where?  The beacon tonight?  Yeah.  Yeah, beacon tonight.  Yeah, I think a few of us are going over there to check out Dice, so.  Definitely.  Uh, we're going to rock.  Hasn't there been enough disaster down at Ground Zero?  Does Dice have to show up?  Is that, is that what he does to warm up for his show?  I don't.  Go down and see something.  Yeah, I know.  Is it the graveyard?  Yeah, I'm going down there.  That way I seem funny. 
[00:58:30]  And he's a friend of the show.  I know, but you know, no.  You know why?  What is wrong with you today?  Because he ain't coming on the goddamn phone to help us out with our goddamn show.  Who pissed you off?  That's why.  No one.  No one's going to believe that I had nothing to do with any of this stuff today.  We ought to get him in the ring.  I'm having a great day.  I love Fridays.  Well, I did help with Linda.  It's great.  Because I do have the, uh...  Of course you do.  Okay.  Don't you think it would be good to get him in the ring?  Absolutely.  Here, give him to Anthony.  Give me that goddamn phone.  All right, we're calling Dice again, Barry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Just give me the goddamn phone. 
[00:59:00]  Hello?  Oh, it's ringing.  It's ringing, Barry.  It's the one-sided conversation.  One ringy-tingy.  Here it comes.  Come on.  Keep ringing.  Keep ringing.  Barry Williams was on Hollywood Squares in 1966.  There you go.  Where'd you find that?  Automatic, uh...  You're on a website?  Mike?  Uh, someone, uh, sent it in.  What?  It's forwarded me to voicemail of Mike.  Where's Dice's phone?  We have Dice's cell phone.  I hope he's got his phone number.  Get a hold of Dice and tell him, uh, we're not going to be in the right frame of mind when 
[00:59:30]  he, uh, wants to be on the show later to, to get, uh...  Exactly.  ...some tickets sold for tonight's show.  It's a give and take, tell the man.  Give and take!  We don't need, uh, you know, the happy dice all the time.  If he's a little sad, we want that, that dice today.  Anyway, Barry, so, uh, Celebrity Boxing, who do you got, uh, lined up so far?  Joey Butterfuoco.  Oh, yes!  Now, who is he going to fight?  And John Wayne Bobbitt.  Joey against John Wayne Bobbitt. 
[01:00:00]  And we've got the Lady Killer and Dickless.  How many below-the-belt, uh, punch jokes have you made so far?  With the John Wayne Bobbitt and his severed junk.  That was the only one I had.  Yeah.  Good one.  Lady Killer and Dickless.  Isn't Joey Butterfuoco, like, 60 years old now?  No, no.  Joey.  And he runs around like a teenager.  Really?  Okay, and who else you got?  That's it.  That's, well, we're trying to, we're lining him up.  You want Dice to fight a girl, right?  Chyna.  Chyna from the WWF?  From the, yep, WWF.  We want him to fight a girl. 
[01:00:30]  How Chyna's career is going after the WWF, that's a no-brainer.  She'll do it.  Do you realize Dice will probably...  Wait a minute.  Why does your career have to be in the toilet to do this?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't know.  You're asking?  A lot of people said to me, you know, man, you know, you must be, uh, you know, not doing well  or something, you know, in order to get in the ring.  I thought, hell, this is a good ground, raising some money for a foundation and...  Exactly.  Let me tell you something.  Barry's probably the only one that really didn't have to do this.  That's the trick of this, Barry.  The other people seemed like they really had to do this to scrape up some cash. 
[01:01:00]  That's right.  They seemed a little more desperate.  Well, apparently it wasn't enough cash for Tonya Harding.  Oh, really?  Well, you know, she just got arrested again.  That's right.  Uh, Rick?  A little DUI action going on.  Yes.  You're not supposed to drive into any poles while you're driving.  She'd remain, she should remain drunk for the rest of her life just to deal with the  way her life has gone.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick?  Rick?  Yes.  They keep hanging up the phone.  Well, you know something?  It's a give and take thing here. 
[01:01:30]  We want to present the idea.  We want Barry to present the idea to Dice and have Dice talk about it.  And, uh, it would be fun and entertaining to listen to.  And for some reason, Dice doesn't want to play now?  He's at ground zero and he's meeting some police officers and he doesn't want to talk.  Well, tell Dice, uh, to have fun at, uh, at the show tonight.  None of us are going.  We're not going.  Gotcha, brutal.  Is he going to get a tear in his eye?  Come on, man. 
[01:02:00]  What is he doing?  All right.  Well, Barry, way to stop down, Dice.  It's been friggin' how long?  It's been like a year.  Jesus Christ.  What the, September 11th.  You know, I think we all trudged down there and paid our respects a little earlier.  What the hell's Dice up to?  I'm busy writing midget jokes.  All right.  Well, Barry.  Maybe we should get some midgets on there, too.  I was thinking maybe Minnie B, Gary Coleman. 
[01:02:30]  That would be, yeah.  Gary Coleman, very good.  Yeah, I would definitely watch that.  Uh, Balloon Not Joe, say they got an idea.  Maybe you could hook these guys up.  I think this would be a great, uh, fight.  Almost like Ali Frazier.  Freddie Boom Boom Washington and Jimmy Dynamite Walker.  There we go.  Wouldn't that be great?  That works for me.  And we need a couple of chicks, too.  Like, uh, Sarah Jessica.  All right, this might be.  And Calista Flockhart, that would be good.  Oh, that would be a good one.  Battle of the Hags.  This might be Dice now, Cole.  No.  Is it? 
[01:03:00]  Nah.  Now, who was that?  Who's on the hotline?  We're wrecking Barry's time.  Barry's very busy.  He's got to get those plans over to the office.  To the printing company.  I do it.  I keep losing them.  And you keep losing them.  Because you're talking to that hot chick of yours.  I am making a move.  Showing her the car magazine.  I am making a move.  I'm really disappointed.  I'm going to...  I'm moving to L.A.  No way.  Don't leave us again.  Why are you leaving me on?  I can't walk down the street, but you guys aren't on the air in L.A. 
[01:03:30]  What is up with that?  Why are you leaving New York, Barry Williams?  So I can get warm.  Really?  Yeah.  Barry.  I want to do more boxing.  I want to do more boxing special.  Are you going to be part of our softball game before you go back to L.A.?  If I'm not...  You know I'm touring this year.  Oh, boy.  You're touring?  I'm touring.  Yeah, we know that.  You're going to be at...  Where are you going to be at?  You're going to be at Westbury, right?  We just did Westbury.  You guys missed it.  Damn it!  You forgot to remind us!  No one reminded me or sent me tickets.  I'd go see Barry Williams.  Listen, you have tickets to any show I do. 
[01:04:00]  You know that.  You forgot to remind us.  We did Westbury with the Monkees.  We're going to be up in Rochester on the 7th.  Of May?  Yeah.  Of June.  Of June.  Okay.  June 7th in Rochester.  And when's the game?  When's the game?  In June, right?  Yeah.  June 1st, I believe.  June 1st.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, boy.  Right now they got me scheduled in Detroit.  But you know what?  Maybe I'll just bail on that one.  Yeah.  Can you send the jet?  You know, we can play in the afternoon, and then I'll just pop up to Detroit for the evening show.  You can wing on over.  Yeah, we got that kind of money. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, look at us up, Barry.  We got that.  18 cities.  You guys got rolling in dough.  All right, Barry.  What we're going to do is...  Dice will call back in a little while, and we'll get you back on the phone, okay?  Oh, sure.  I'll just be your whore.  I'll sit around all afternoon.  Oh!  You know, I don't...  You know, while you go smooth talk and sweet talk, Dice, to get on the phone, I just got  to hang out, you know, and wait and hope and pray the phone ring.  He's running Barry Williams Enterprises, for God's sake.  Where are you, Barry?  Right down in Connecticut. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, you know, if you're down...  I was going to say, if you're down the street, come by for some crabs.  If I want to.  Yeah, but you know what?  You don't have anything special lined up for me.  Like, when I come over, I get to eat a razor.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Or I get a stripper, take it off, or GXY.  That didn't make the error.  Yeah, you can't say shave the kitty cat.  You can't put that kind of, uh, the P word like that.  Oh, I got dumped?  Yeah, they don't like the P word when you're talking about the kitty cat.  That was very funny.  Oh, shave a kitty cat.  Yeah, but you did come down there and shave, uh... 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, we gave you some good stuff.  You gave me good stuff, and now what do you got, crabs for me?  Tina Yothers and Natalie from the Facts of Life.  I like that.  I like Tina Yothers.  That's a good one.  Oh, definitely.  I'd give it to that bruiser Natalie, though.  Well, Barry, how about this?  We're going to move on, because we've got to take a break.  If you're around and you want to be back on the show, great.  All right.  I'm going to be around.  You know, I have nothing else to do.  This is my life.  We love Barry Williams.  All right, Barry, we'll talk to you hopefully a little later. 
[01:06:00]  You got it, man.  All right, thank you.  The real Greg Brady, everyone.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams.  Chris Titus outside.  There's this girl.  I don't know what to do with this.  Yeah, this is really freaky.  She's been sending us some really weird letters from Dallas.  Well, we got a letter from her today, and it sounds like maybe she's in trouble or something.  She might be in trouble.  I'm completely serious here.  No bit.  She doesn't know who she could turn to, so she's calling us, Anthony. 
[01:06:30]  Calling ONA and writing letters.  Said there's some things going on in her life that she can't talk about with her family,  and she's going to discuss it with us.  So, we'll get to her in a few minutes here, okay?  Uh-huh.  And Chris, stay on the line.  And Chris Titus and Rick's 90210 tape.  All on the way on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  I want to give a big F.U. out to those cookies in the orange and black, 
[01:07:00]  the Philadelphia Flyers, who can't score a f***ing goal in four games,  make 50, 60, 70 million f***ing dollars, and they can't even score a goal.  Go to the drugstore, get a pack of razor blades, and slice your wrist, you pussies.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big F.U. out to Bob Clark and the Philadelphia Flyers  for giving us loyal fans here in Philadelphia yet another year  in which we went out in the first round. 
[01:07:30]  F.U., Bob Clark, you suck as GM.  And guess what?  Our owner, Ed Snyder, you know what?  Big F.U. to you, too.  Grow a set of yambags and fire Bob Clark's Canadian ass.  Get them out of here and give us a good winning team.  After 17 years, we've been waiting 17 years.  F.U., Bob Clark, and the Philadelphia Flyers.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to the city of Buffalo and the Bills.  You guys get through Bledsoe.  You guys throw a freaking rally in a parade.  You guys lost F.U. four Super Bowls. 
[01:08:00]  You stink.  F.U. Buffalo and your goddamn second city.  Patriot.  End of messages.  O.B. and A.  Who else gives you a bus filled with naked teens  that you can see from the streets of Manhattan?  What a day for new teens.  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest the boy or bus.  Juliani, review it.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:08:30]  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Chris Titus.  We're going to bring him in in like a minute here.  He's had a very interesting life.  Of course.  And his show is really, really good on Fox.  Also, we got Amber from Dallas checking in.  She's been writing us some very strange letters.  Well, it seems like she needs a little, a little help.  And she wants to talk to us.  But first, we got to say hi to Paul the pilot who almost died on us.  What happened, Paul? 
[01:09:00]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Now, Paul, last we heard from you, it was about a week ago, maybe, a week and a half ago,  where you said, guys, look over the skies above Manhattan because I'm going to write  wow for you on Wednesday.  Well, I was on my way.  And what happened?  11,000 feet over the Hudson River.  The number three cylinder sucked in a valve.  Uh-oh.  So I had to turn around and scuttle it back to the airport, and I just made it.  So I was going to call you guys up there, but I had to figure out a way to tell my wife 
[01:09:30]  I blew up a $60,000 engine.  So your engine blew?  Yeah, it sucked in a valve.  Wow.  I made it home on three cylinders.  Oh, it's a four-cylinder plane and one went.  One went.  So I made it home.  I was losing altitude the whole way home.  Boy, that must have sounded like a mess.  Yeah.  It scared the crap out of me.  How freaked were you?  Not really.  Once I established the glide, I knew I'd make it back. 
[01:10:00]  I just didn't want to look behind me because I know I was trailing a lot of black smoke  when it should have been white.  Right.  Was the engine giving you power at all?  I mean...  Yeah, I lost probably about 20% or 30% power.  Wow.  But at the altitude I was at, I mean, it was at 11,300 feet when it blew up, and when  I got back in the pattern at the airport, I was at about 1,100 feet.  Yeah.  So I just made it back.  Oh, man.  And so I wanted to call you guys and let you know I'm getting it fixed.  Okay.  And when I get it done, you've got a wow coming over city, over Boston, and over Philly. 
[01:10:30]  Nice.  So I'm definitely, you guys are first on the list, and I'll get it done.  Did you declare an emergency?  No.  What'd you do?  You just came in like a normal lander?  Yeah, well, it's an uncontrolled field, so I didn't talk to anybody.  Oh.  Matter of fact, I put the airplane away and didn't even say anything to anybody until  like two days later after I got over my drunk.  Aren't you supposed to talk to the FAA about that?  No, no, no.  Really?  No, because it didn't, the only person that was in danger was me. 
[01:11:00]  What if the plane hit somebody on the ground?  Well, then I would have reported it.  But they have accidents and incidents, and this was neither, so.  Wow.  Yeah.  What kind of maintenance you have done on that thing?  Yeah.  The maintenance?  Yeah.  Maybe something happened on that end.  No, no.  No, it was just a retainer clip let go, and it's stuck in a valve.  It happens every now and then.  Ah, there you go.  No big deal.  There's no problem in your Volkswagen when that happens. 
[01:11:30]  You pull over and call a friend or something.  Yeah, I can't pull over to a cloud.  That's the only problem.  But there was plenty of other.  I mean, I passed Caldwell and Lincoln Park and a couple other airports on the way.  I could have sat down if I didn't make it.  Paul, you're a pussy.  You should have used that black smoke to make the wow.  Next time, okay?  All right, Paul.  We're glad you're all right, man.  Hey, listen.  Guys, keep me in mind for your softball game, will you?  Definitely.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  I'll talk to you guys later.  You got it.  Paul the pilot, everyone. 
[01:12:00]  Take care.  Let's get Chris Titus in here.  Stalker Patty in an ambulance now.  Patty.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Hey.  How are you?  I'm on a better phone this time.  I'm in the ambulance going home, so the two drivers who are also fans of the show allowed me  to use the phone.  And who do you want to thank for your two brand new feet?  Thank you, Opie and Anthony for introducing me to those two doctors who were able to help me.  We're like Maury.  Just when you thought we were cold-hearted bastards. 
[01:12:30]  We're like Maury helping out the freaks.  That's right.  Like Stalker Patty and her disgusting bony duck feet.  Not anymore, though, Ann.  She's got nice feet now.  No, I got normal feet now.  Anthony, happy birthday to you.  All right, Patty.  It's not about you.  We got Chris Titus in the studio.  He's a very, very famous man.  Chris Titus.  Okay.  Christopher Titus.  Hey, but I just called in a hello.  All right.  Hello.  May I say nice feet?  And happy birthday, Anthony.  I'll let you go now.  Shut up.  All right, Patty.  Okay, bye-bye. 
[01:13:00]  I love you.  It's your birthday?  Leave me alone.  No, it's not even your birthday.  No, it's not my birthday until tomorrow.  Oh, all right.  That's true.  I ain't saying nothing about it.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  Blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  Yeah, it's Saturday, man.  You ain't on the radio.  I can't use you to whore my show.  Hell, what the hell.  Christopher Titus.  What's up, guys?  You're playing Caroline's this weekend.  So let's get that right out of the way.  Back on the road.  Playing Caroline's.  Leno gave me a big lecture last time I was on the road.  I mean, last time I was in his show.  So I'm back out on the road.  What was the lecture?  We were talking about comics who don't, you know, they get a TV show and then they stop 
[01:13:30]  doing comedy.  Right.  That's true, yeah.  Then a TV show quits and they go back on the road and they suck.  Right.  Because they go to an act that was five years ago.  And so I was like, yeah, you know, every comic that ever got a show and stopped doing  the comedy never got the skill made.  And I'm just like, well, I'm like, you know, all of a sudden I had this fear that I'm  going to be working, you know, as a shoe cobbler or in a body shop or something.  Cobbler.  Yeah.  Do people cobble anymore?  I think they do.  Interesting.  There's a couple.  Well, there's a guy over here in New York.  We saw him.  He's a cowboy.  He's about four foot two.  I think he used to be an elf.  And he had his own show and didn't go out on the road.  I don't know. 
[01:14:00]  It was just a job.  For God's sake.  I just brought up a job that possibly could happen.  Right.  A humorous job.  And then you ripped me on it.  Right.  Christopher Titus playing Caroline's.  We got to go to Amber real fast.  But I think Christopher Titus can help us with this because he had a very interesting  upbringing himself, Anthony.  Interesting, you call it.  I've seen his act at Caroline's.  Very funny.  Thank you.  And there are certain times during the act the whole audience goes,  Like just, oh my God.  It's a night full of laughter and anal tightening.  Yeah.  Because you just sit there going like, wow. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  You're like, ha, ha, ha.  Oh my God.  Wait, which?  That could not possibly have happened.  Yeah.  Which one got to you in?  Oh God.  The one we were talking about is mom and in the mental institution and the killing of  the guy.  What was it?  It's comedy, comedy, comedy, people.  Can you hear it?  It is like a TV movie gone bad.  Except gone funny.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a TV movie gone funny.  Help me.  I don't know of anyone else.  I want people in seats, man.  What are you doing?  No, absolutely.  I don't know anybody who could turn that into funny.  But is it funny? 
[01:15:00]  I got to be careful how I say this.  Are you turning this stuff into laughs?  Hell yeah.  In your act.  Okay.  It's like you've watched the show.  Right.  You know, the show isn't dealing with ha-ha funny situations, but it's hysterical to watch.  Right.  You know, his father's very abusive, very nasty, but boy.  I'm actually making me sad.  Yeah, see, look, he's getting all choked up.  Okay, that was fun.  I was over it until now.  It's all coming back now.  Someone wants to know why...  Yeah, it's on the show.  Someone wants to know why Titus hasn't been on Fox for months.  Not for months.  For four weeks.  A few weeks?  Four weeks. 
[01:15:30]  Because they're trying out a puppet show.  Oh, right, right, right.  It's always making me feel real good about my career and the time I've spent working as  a writer and getting nominated for a Writer's Guild Award.  And yeah, we like you.  Here's a puppet show.  Puppet show in your place.  Sit down, relax, watch the puppet.  Watch the puppet show.  You're going to have some time off.  Watch the puppet show.  But I had a meeting with the president of Fox two days ago, and I have another meeting next  week.  So, they're still having meetings, which means that they haven't...  Did they tell you it was the president, or was it a big puppet?  They had to sit the front of her.  Hello, Christopher.  You're so very good. 
[01:16:00]  Okay, why...  Grover's the president of Fox now.  I don't know why.  So, anyway, we had a meeting.  This is what we're going to do next week.  But I end up in a mental hospital at the end of this year.  When they start...  You do?  They're going to start showing the show again in June.  And I end up in a...  But it's not a special episode, is it?  No.  Very special.  The next four are badass.  Good.  The next four are badass.  All right, cool.  Let's say hi to Amber.  Yeah, this situation, I don't know what to make of this.  Amber.  Yeah.  Hi.  Amber, you've been sending us some strange letters from Dallas.  Yeah, I know.  They're not strange.  They're letters that seem like...  She writes a crayon or something.  No, she wrote in pencil. 
[01:16:30]  It was on some of that old...  Remember the yellow paper that you would get in school?  With the really wide lines in the dot that time?  The wide lines, and you'd almost see wood pulp in it.  Yes, exactly.  It was kind of like that.  You could actually use it as paper or turn it into bread.  Yeah, yeah.  It could be...  It's recycling as you're writing on it.  It's turning back into...  Hello, Amber.  Hey.  Hi.  So now, you wrote in your letter...  I was meaning to be Opie and Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Well, no, that's okay.  Actually, Opie got...  I think they came in the same envelope.  I got one letter, and Ant got one letter.  And there were two separate pieces of paper. 
[01:17:00]  One said to Opie.  Maybe that's why mine didn't make sense, because maybe it was one letter, and I got the first  half, and Ant got the second half with all the juicy stuff.  Well, no, for a letter to make sense, I think you have to actually read it, Opie.  I read it.  Dick.  Stop.  Uh, Amber.  Yeah.  You're 14.  Yeah.  And you live in Dallas.  Actually, no.  I live in Glennair.  Well, is it around Dallas?  Yeah.  Okay.  And there was something very disturbing in your letter.  We were just going to... 
[01:17:30]  You know, we get a lot of letters, and we were just going to kind of throw it away.  But it seemed like maybe you were in a situation that was a little dangerous.  Yeah.  Just from the sound of your letter, and we figured we might want to address this and help  you out.  Yeah.  Now, what, uh, you, you, you said something about a situation you can't talk to your family  about, but...  Yeah, actually, there's two of them.  Two situations.  Yeah.  I cannot talk to my family about them.  Now, who do you, who do you live with?  My grandparents.  You live with your grandparents.  Yeah.  What happened with your parents? 
[01:18:00]  My parents live in Colorado.  They live in Colorado.  Yeah.  And why don't you live with your parents?  Because they're stupid.  Because they're stupid.  I'm going up there Sunday.  Well, maybe it's a lack of respect that was why you don't live with your parents.  No, I'm going up there Sunday to live with them.  Oh, to live with them.  Yeah.  So, how long have you been separated from your parents?  Two and a half weeks.  Oh, why did they go without you?  That's not separation.  That's vacation.  Well, because my grandpa was in the hospital, so they left me down here.  Your grandpa was in the hospital?  Yeah.  In Texas? 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  So, they left you down there with your grandfather?  Yes.  Why?  I don't know.  Like, to take care of him, or...  Yeah.  Is he in a hospital?  No, he's at home right now.  He's outside mowing that now.  So, if you hear weird noises, it's okay.  He's moaning?  No.  Mowing.  If you hear weird noises, it's because he's mowing.  Oh, he's mowing.  Mowing.  Yeah, mowing.  Oh, wow.  She sounds totally waste.  You're right, man.  This girl screwed up.  He's okay.  I've had her parents have left her for two whole weeks.  Two weeks.  He's watching her grandpa mow the lawn.  What is wrong with her?  I can't help her.  All right. 
[01:19:00]  So, what do you want to tell us?  What...  Yeah.  What's this situation?  Well, the first one was that somebody named...  Well, don't give any names.  Okay.  Don't give any names.  All right.  There's this guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  He went over to our house and he stole our CD.  Me and my cousin.  That's CD.  Stealing.  Doesn't seem like that big a deal.  So, how old is this guy?  It just gets worse.  One of them is 13 and he had a couple of friends over.  And they stole your CDs?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:30]  No NSYNC.  What the hell is going to happen to this girl?  No, there ain't no NSYNC.  Okay.  I'll have to say that this is not a problem that needs the Opie and Anthony muscle.  You brought me in.  Hustle.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm shot and killed a guy.  You brought me in for some consulting on this.  What is that?  We brought the expert in.  I say buy some more CDs.  Titus' mom killed Titus' father.  Buy more CDs.  Problem solved.  What's the other thing?  What's the other thing?  Okay.  The other thing was that I told Awesome Garrett yesterday.  You what?  The other thing was that I told Awesome Garrett it yesterday.  You told Awesome Garrett? 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Let's get Awesome Garrett in here.  Get Awesome Garrett because he is truly awesome.  Look how awesome this guy is.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Isn't he awesome?  Hell yeah.  All right.  Awesome Garrett.  What did our lovely Amber tell you?  Now Amber, you want Garrett to say it on the air?  Because Garrett did not tell us what you said yesterday to him.  I mean, it's already so outrageous and sordid.  I don't know how to deal with it.  Hi, Amber.  He's mowing the lawn?  She doesn't care. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Awesome Garrett.  What?  I got to break this news.  Uh-oh.  Hey, are you still there, Amber?  Oh, okay.  What?  What?  It's bad news?  It's like really bad and uncomfortable news.  Do it.  How awesome are you, Garrett?  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Amber.  Yeah.  You got to tell us.  I think you should tell us.  Amber, is this a crime?  Sort of.  Sort of a crime that was...  It's definitely a crime.  It's definitely a crime.  Is it abuse? 
[01:21:00]  Yep.  All right.  Uh-oh.  All right, Amber, Amber, Amber.  Do me a favor.  Just tell us what happened, then we can get into it.  What happened?  Two guys raped me.  Yesterday?  No.  Last year and the year before.  Okay.  Wait, what'd she say?  She said two guys raped her.  Raped?  Yeah.  I have to have it because my grandpa's coming.  Last year.  And do you have contact with these people?  One left down the street.  And...  So you were visiting your grandpa and this happened last year, you said?  Yeah.  So why can't you tell your parents? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I tell you...  Because.  What?  Because.  Maybe you ought to tell your parents.  I'll tell you what.  My niece was getting messed with at school and she told me and I handled it.  I mean, you know, you understand that people, whatever you're afraid to say, people do want to go deal with it.  But, I mean, you probably got...  Your dad, I'm sure, would want to go down and tear some ass.  What?  Yeah.  Why can't you tell your parents, Amber?  Well, because my dad's a mean ass.  He's going to be mad?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  Yeah.  You can't say the S word.  But that's the guy you want to tell, though. 
[01:22:00]  You want to tell the mean guy.  So he used to...  Your dad used to beat you.  These weren't the same kids that stole your CDs, was it?  No.  Was it...  Was it...  We just bought the house.  How old were these guys?  One was 14, another was 13, 12, and a couple of friends of us.  No, the CD people?  Yeah.  No, how old were the guys that assaulted you?  One of them that worked down the street was 97.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:22:30]  What?  97?  Yes.  Stop it.  Wait a minute.  Really?  Hold on.  Hold on.  How did 97...  Was Grandpa involved in this at all?  No.  My best...  It's my ex-best friend's great-grandpa.  97.  Right.  Your ex-best friend's grandpa did this to you?  Okay.  Great-grandfather.  Great-grandfather.  I have to say, you win.  Wow.  I mean...  Now, can I have some wow stickers?  Sure.  Whatever.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait. 
[01:23:00]  No, no.  I wasn't making that crap up either.  I thought it happened.  Well, don't you think maybe you should tell somebody?  Well...  How did...  I can't bring enough courage to...  You know, check this out, guys.  Check this out.  She's...  How old are you, Amber?  14.  14.  She's got a...  She's a 13, 14-year-old girl.  She's going to tell...  By the way, this 97-year-old guy raped me.  And a 43-year-old.  Well, that's a little...  Oh, Jesus.  At the same time?  No.  When was...  The 40...  The 97-year-old was last year, and then the 43-year-old was the year before. 
[01:23:30]  How...  What...  What...  You know, obviously, we don't want you to get into any details about this.  No, but...  But what...  Like, how...  How is there a situation where a 97-year-old guy was able to do this to you?  I have no clue.  He just, like, called me over to talk to his friend.  I was like, okay, might as well.  Wait, wait, wait.  You can't say the F word.  I'm sorry.  Hold on, hold on.  Wow. 
[01:24:00]  Hold on, Amber.  You're cursing there.  Amber, you sound very confused.  Who wanted to kick your ass?  You went over there, and then the 97-year-old said he wanted to kick your ass?  No, on the phone, he said that.  If I don't go over there...  How did he have your phone number?  A 97...  I don't know.  So he called you up and said, come over here, I'm going to kick your ass.  Yes.  So you went over.  So you went over there.  Well, plus his great-granddaughter was there.  Okay.  Okay, this story sounded squirrely and squirrely.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  I gotta tell you.  I mean, maybe she doesn't tell anybody, because the story sounds kind of squirrely. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, Amber, what's squirrely?  No one will believe me, though.  Well, but listen to the way you're telling it.  Well, you're not believing me.  No, no, I'm just telling you, though.  I mean, understand our confusion.  Well, I don't want to put her in the position where if it did happen, we're like the people  that don't believe her, you know what I mean?  Well, okay.  I don't want to be those guys.  I don't want to be the don't-believer guy.  Okay, all right.  Who on the phone said they were going to kick your ass?  The 97-year-old guy.  The 97-year-old guy?  What's his name?  Was it the old guy or the young guy?  Was it the old guy or the young guy?  The old guy. 
[01:25:00]  The old guy.  So you went over to his house after you say he's going to kick your ass for whatever reason.  When someone told you, okay, so you went over there and then he attacked you?  Yeah.  Okay, and then how did the 43-year-old guy come involved in this?  That was a year earlier.  Yeah, that was a year earlier.  All right, what happened?  You don't get vacation to grandpa's house anymore is what I would say.  Wow.  Me and my cousin was walking down the street, okay?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden this guy comes up and grabs me by the back of my hair, you know, and pulls  me into his house.  And then that happened.  Hmm.  He, like, pushed me down a little bit. 
[01:25:30]  All right, well, yeah, yeah, I'll get into any more details, please.  We don't need the details here, please.  So what do you want us to do about this?  I don't care.  Well, you kind of wanted us to talk to you about this.  Yeah.  Well, what, okay, tell you what, what comes up for you around it all the time?  What's coming up for you around the whole thing?  I mean, when you see old people, you freak out.  What, what, what, what's going on?  No, I'm not into, like, boys or anything, you know?  Right.  I'm afraid they're going to do that again.  Well, Amber, all I can tell you, all I can tell you is you got to tell somebody. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Even if it's not your parents, you're going to keep it from parents, sit down with a therapist  or something, or tell somebody.  Call the goddamn cops!  Yeah, my niece, my niece.  But they won't do anything.  It's been two and a half years ago.  Don't matter.  If this, if this, I'm not going to judge if this happened, didn't happen, or whatever.  But you sit down, and you really assess this in your head, and make sure you know if it,  if it did happen or didn't happen, you know, because I can't make that assumption here.  And if it absolutely happened, then you got to call the cops. 
[01:26:30]  And you got to tell someone.  Then you got to tell somebody.  Or if not, you can actually, so you don't want to, you just want to get even with the  old guy.  Hide the insurer.  Maybe take a, you know, you can, you can just take him out to a stiff wing and he'll blow  over and break a hip.  I'm telling you, it's easy to get even with this guy.  But, but the thing about my niece got, my niece, Amy, got molested when she was five.  And pretty bad.  And what happened was, and she's gay, and she's, and she's gay now.  She's gay now.  Now we, you think that did it?  My wife and I, I don't know, man. 
[01:27:00]  She said, she said some weird things.  Like a couple times, she said, she said about my, we have a baby now, Kenny.  And she said to that, Kenny, she goes, oh, Kenny, Kenny's lucky because she's not going  to get, she's got parents that will protect her, and she's not going to get messed with,  so she's not going to be gay.  And all of a sudden I go, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, does that mean you, you know?  So she says little things, but she hasn't had a relationship yet, so it's, it's really  weird.  Don't, don't mistake you getting, you, you being afraid of men that you're gay.  Don't be afraid of that.  Just go down and talk to somebody.  Get it, get it, you know, talk to somebody you trust.  If you don't want to tell your parents, that's cool.  Don't tell your parents.  But the more you carry it around, the more you can carry it around. 
[01:27:30]  You're going to be 40 in one day, and you're going to have all this crap inside you, and,  and you just, you got to talk to somebody.  Amber, could you tell your mom?  Well, you guys make it so easy to be funny on this show.  Yeah, I know.  Look at who we bring in.  Hey, let's talk about the 12-year-old rape victim.  Okay.  Look who we bring in, Titus.  Yeah, great, nice job.  Look at which phone call we take.  I'm even scared walking around my grandparents.  Huh?  I'm even scared walking around my grandparents.  Why is that?  Because my grandpa talks.  What does that mean?  He talks.  The way he talks, like, come here, I want to show you something.  I'm like, no thanks.  What does he show you?  What?  All right, Amber. 
[01:28:00]  What?  Amber, Amber, I have a question.  What is this?  Is, are you saying, is your grandfather doing things?  No.  The way he talks, like, come here, I want to show you something.  Then he shows me something while I'm tired.  Oh, oh, but you're freaked out because you think something's going to happen.  Yeah.  You got to tell.  I'm shaking right now.  You got to tell somebody.  Amber, you know, it's going to stick with you.  And you're too young right now.  You got to tell somebody.  If you don't tell somebody, it's up to you, though.  You know, by the way, calling these guys.  These guys, I mean, great guys, but a couple of humps when it comes to this kind of stuff. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, we ain't the guy to call.  Seriously, we're not the people to call.  I'm a stand-up comic actor, and these guys are DJs.  You know, you don't need to be calling in.  You need to go down.  There's got to be a...  Yeah, you got to...  Crack the phone book.  There's got to be a council you can call, whether it's...  What are they called?  Oh, call a rape hotline.  There you go, rape hotline.  Is it a wacky morning show, a wacky afternoon show, or rape hotline?  I guess the rape hotline would probably be the right one thing.  Do it, though.  We should be the last ones on the list of people to call.  That is a great person to call.  Call that. 
[01:29:00]  Can you do that?  Amber, when you hang up, do that.  You got to talk about it.  Call...  What's the number?  Amber, call information.  Tell them what town you're in, and ask them for the rape hotline.  Right?  Amber?  Yeah.  Are you listening?  You got to do this, because then you could talk to them, and they'll set you in the right  direction, because dopey DJs like us are not the people to talk to.  No, we're dopey.  Yeah, no, we're dopey.  But why don't we...  No, you guys are cool.  Why don't we just call the cops for you? 
[01:29:30]  Well, you know something?  I think it's best if she calls that first, and then they can maybe ascertain more information  than we could, and make a judgment and decision based on that as to what she should do next.  And I'm sure that the cops are going to love to get a phone call from a couple of wacky  DJ guys.  Yeah.  Hey, this girl, can you deal with it?  Sure, all right.  And now the weather.  I don't know.  It just doesn't seem to have the same impact as her calling.  Amber.  Amber, they're trained at the Rape Hotline.  You should call them, and they'll be able to at least talk to you. 
[01:30:00]  You didn't dial a number and think you were getting Adam and Dr. Drew, did you?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Amber.  I've been down for like two and a half days.  Amber, trust me.  If you don't do this, if you don't call the Rape Hotline or get involved, somebody involved  in this, you're going to deal with this for a really long time.  And there's a lot...  It's a screwed up road you're going down right now, unless you deal with it.  Did I just tell the whole country about this?  No, you didn't.  No.  No one knows who I am.  A few cities.  A few cities.  About 12 cities.  Just do that.  Call the Rape Hotline.  Yeah.  Okay?  Promise me.  Promise me you can do it.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  It's Christopher Tidey.  Promise me.  I will come out there, and I'll push that 97 and go, like, uh, take that.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Amber, hold on, all right?  Okay.  Rick, make sure she does the right thing.  If you need the number, uh, Rick, perhaps you could punch it up on the computer.  There you go.  They have an internet thing.  Is there some sort of device we could use that maybe is connected around the world that  possibly we could find a phone number where Amber lives that maybe would have a Rape  Council?  That's what I'm thinking.  Someone help us out.  What town was she in?  I don't know.  Somewhere in, uh, Texas.  This is the weirdest call I've ever had.  I know.  I apologize. 
[01:31:00]  Let's get the boopee comic on.  Don't worry.  No, it's all right.  We'll play commercials.  We regroup all the time on the show.  And now?  But here's, I mean.  You should have been here for the Linda Lovelace stuff.  It was great.  People love, uh, love this stuff on the, on the computer.  Someone heard the town she's from outside of Dallas.  Get us a number.  Someone already, uh, wrote a number down.  Are you serious?  For Texas.  Good.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, tell them thanks.  That's good for good listeners.  Something tells me the Rape Crisis Hotline in Texas is booming.  You ever been to Texas?  I hear.  People are a little high strung.  That's pretty bad. 
[01:31:30]  You call up, they're like, yeah, blah, blah, blah.  You use Rape, too.  Okay, I got it.  Amber.  You got it, Rick.  Uh, Ben, off the, uh, OPEC.  Amber.  Amber.  Amber.  You there?  Amber.  Hello.  Amber.  Amber.  Now, where'd she go?  Interesting.  Hey, Amber.  Hello.  Hello.  All right, she's there.  We'll give her the number, okay?  Just know in my life, man, that stuff will stick with you, you know?  Of course.  That stuff will so stick with you.  And, you know, I didn't want to be the guy, you know, with, oh, oh, you're lying, you know?  I don't want to be that either. 
[01:32:00]  Then the next guy in line is the, it's your fault, guys.  No, no, no, no.  So, even, even, even if she is, you know, then she still needs, if you're telling those  kind of lies, you still need some kind of help.  So, there's something obviously going on.  And we need the guys to do it.  There's something going on, but, uh, I mean.  I'll let you know when they put me through.  But the thing is, the thing is with the 97-year-old guy doing it, and you're, you're, I don't know.  It just sounds bizarre.  It sounds bizarre.  Totally bizarre.  Totally.  Happy face.  Yeah.  Uh, we got to take a break, uh, and then we'll talk to you, all right?  All right.  How long is this break going to be? 
[01:32:30]  You want me to stay on hold?  Uh, about five minutes.  All right, I'll stay on hold.  All right.  If we get disconnected, I'll call back.  Okay.  I mean, 97, it's like Burgess Meredith going after you.  Burgess Meredith, get in here.  I'm calling.  I want to show you something.  All right.  I'm calling you.  You got to get here or I'll beat the crap out of you.  Rocky will beat you.  We're going to chase a chicken.  Christopher Titus in the studio.  He's playing Carolines this weekend.  Yeah.  We're going to start getting, um.  I have the counseling rape victims.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  We're going to come on down to the show.  Okay, about 20 minutes during my show.  We're going to start.  We're going to start having some chuckles after the break, okay?  I promise.  Now the pressure's on.  Now the pressure is on.  All right.  No pressure.  You just hang, man.  You just hang and have fun with us today.  And I guess Dice is checking in.  And that's why Happy Face was calling.  Ah.  Dice checking in from ground zero, I think.  Great.  All on the way.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Opie and Anthony.  Two of those drunk and white trash. 
[01:33:30]  Ah, you got dribbles.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  In studio, Christopher Titus.  Hello.  If you're a circus freak, call in.  We'll help you through it.  Yeah.  And our counseling sessions that we're having now.  He's playing in power lines this weekend.  That's right.  Amber called back.  We're giving her all sorts of phone numbers to call.  Hopefully she will do the right thing and call some of these numbers.  Hey, the 97-year-old guy didn't sing Angelica. 
[01:34:00]  Angelica's doing that, didn't he?  We gave her the Ray Pot line and the geriatric Ray Pot line.  Yeah, right?  Oh.  I blame Viagra.  Right.  You popped three at one time, my friend.  You're going after anybody.  You get a 97-year-old guy that does Viagra.  All of a sudden, his junk starts working.  What do you think?  What do you think?  He's going to look at a 97-year-old woman and go, let's get it on.  Exactly.  First of all, there ain't no woman Viagra, so that thing is just like a desert.  Right.  So he figured that this 12, 13-year-old girl will be the one. 
[01:34:30]  Well, he shouldn't have gone all the way to the other end of the spectrum, you know.  Get a nice spring chicken of 55 or something.  A lot of people don't know what they do when they wake up after the Viagra.  They're not sure.  Right.  Maybe all the blood rushed out of his head and he just went wild.  Now, before they had Viagra, I'm hanging out with my dad at the  Oakland Rosa show and we're walking around.  He's married to this new woman and we're walking around.  I'm telling you.  No, hold on, hold on.  We're just cleaning up because they dumped out of that.  I don't know why.  Believe me.  What?  It makes no sense.  We understand.  It makes no sense.  You should be able to say that because it's a medical thing.  What did I say?  And that's what he had to do. 
[01:35:00]  Put the needle into his.  He did.  Our father had to get out.  You can't say the P word for the guy's thing.  You could say it.  We say mule.  We say yam bag.  We say junk.  You got it.  So here's the thing.  My dad's junk is not working as well as it should be because he had a couple of heart  attacks.  Four.  Actually, they actually.  Your dad had four.  Yeah.  They actually revoked his organ donor card.  Four.  Yeah.  So he's talking to me.  What's he talking?  He's father-son talk, which is freak me out.  I'm walking around the Oklahoma street and he goes, he's going, yeah, so before the  Viagra thing, I had this needle and he had to shoot it. 
[01:35:30]  And he goes, one day, he goes, I figured, they give me, they say, 10 cc's you shoot in.  And I figured, so my dad goes, shoot in right, right, right into the, yeah, the junk.  Yeah.  Okay.  And he goes, he goes, I think 10 cc's, 10 cc's is supposed to what I'm doing.  The doctor says, don't use any more 10 cc's.  Well, I'm thinking, you know, I want to perform for the new lady.  Can I slow you down a little bit?  Yeah.  Because I don't get it.  So, so before Viagra.  But what do you, oh, before Viagra, there was something you could.  Yes.  My dad got married to this woman, right?  Right.  And he wanted to make sure she was.  But what does this stuff do?  It does what Viagra does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, actually, I think it took the, it probably takes the place of the blood that would normally 
[01:36:00]  go there to put it in the state.  No, it was a chemical.  It was something because it, whatever, it constricted everything so it would, so this junk would  expand.  Hey, is that good?  I did this.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  All right, go ahead.  I'm just getting a needle.  So walking around the road to show, my dad's talking to me, he goes, he goes, yeah, just  like tossing it off.  He goes, so I'm going to use it, right?  And he goes, I figure 10 cc's.  They said, you know, 10 cc's is my normal.  I'll do 30 cc's.  So my dad's junk turned, he goes, he goes, he goes, my junk turned black, and he goes, 
[01:36:30]  and it took 11 hours, 11 hours to go down.  And I'm literally like, just boat over laughing.  That's funny.  I couldn't imagine having to put a needle.  No.  No.  I'm getting that feeling.  Don't you get that feeling down there when somebody even talks about it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't imagine any woman looking around to him going, you know, you are so sexy.  Give me my syringe.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  See how important it is?  Let's do it.  What?  See how important sex is to guys?  If you're willing to take a needle and jam it into your junk, it's a pretty important  thing.  Exactly.  It's part of perspective for all the ladies out there.  Hey, what happened to Happy Face?  He was calling back abs at the commercials and no Happy Face.  Dice down at Ground Zero.  We're a little distracted, Christopher Titus, because Dice called all emotional.  He wasn't ready to, he wasn't in the right state of mind to be on our show and we wanted  to go to Ground Zero.  Then we found out he was going down to Ground Zero.  We want to see how that went for him. 
[01:37:30]  I'm just imagining the guys that are down there now working are probably like, all right,  you know, De Niro was here a few months ago and we just really want to pave this road  and get this done.  Exactly.  You know, enough with the visits, yeah, we're doing our job and, you know, enough with  the visits.  Yeah, well, it just becomes a little more about the personality that's going down there than  it does about Ground Zero.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, if you want to go down.  I got my superhero jacket on with the studs.  If you want to go down and not tell the press you're going, I kind of buy that you want 
[01:38:00]  to see it, but if you're going, hey, tell everybody no, you're going down to Ground  Zero.  Yeah.  It's not as, not as, I think he's paying his respects, but it's a little, a little weird.  You think he, you think he got a tear up when he's looking around?  Of course you did.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm getting a little choked up over here.  I, I have no problem admitting it.  I went down there.  I bawled.  It's just amazing.  Well, we were in LA.  Here's what pissed me off about it is that people in LA were like, I'm not going to work.  Really?  You're in LA and you're not going to work?  Yeah.  Look at the people, the people there, that word happened, are busting their ass.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  You know, you know, don't, don't let these people.  Why isn't LA going to work?  Huh?  Why wouldn't LA, someone in LA go to work?  It happened.  Like I called the crew, I, you know, I talked to my partners and they said, what do you  want to do?  I said, well, I think these guys are putting out fires and saving lives.  We should probably keep going.  Don't let these terrorists win and all, you know, and then what the hell's going on with  terrorists?  You know, you, you know, any country that doesn't listen to their, their women is going down  because you know, Dan, where there was some chick that was, oh, was serving them food  while they were planning that thing.  And she, pardon me, what did you say?  You're going to what?  No, don't yell at me.  Okay.  When your ass got lost in the desert last year, who got you to Jalalabad? 
[01:39:00]  That was me, my friend.  And, you know, okay, I'll show that before you hit me with a stick, but I want you to  know I only made you cold sandwiches because you won't let me learn to read a freaking recipe  book.  See, that's another problem they got.  This whole sex angle.  Yeah.  Right?  They cover their women up.  I go on.  They put them in their robes.  Right.  And they, uh, they don't get to look at attractive women.  No, they don't get to.  I think that loosens you up a little bit.  I think so.  You know what you get?  If you're getting, uh, you're getting your, uh, your junk waxed.  Is that right?  Okay.  Very good.  I'm doing what I can't do. 
[01:39:30]  It gives you, uh, you have the toughest, edgiest radio station in the country.  It's junk waxed.  I know.  It's silly.  I know.  Hey, uh, Dice on the phone.  We used to say.  Dice on the phone.  This is Dice.  Oh, oh, oh.  Dice?  Dice?  Well, actually, it's Happy Face in there.  Oh, hang on.  Hang on.  See, Happy Face has to call for.  It's Happy Face.  Happy Face calls for Dice.  Hang on.  Now he's getting the legend.  What a crappy phone.  This gets so freaking old after a while.  Who's Happy Face?  Dice.  Happy Face is the guy that makes the call for the legend.  And then, uh, he gets us on the phone and then he hands the phone over to the legend. 
[01:40:00]  It's like a secretary, you know?  I was on Dice's show, by the way.  Dice's show.  Remember the show he did when he was a radio executive?  Oh, I mean a record company executive?  Oh.  I'm ready to present you with the legend.  All right, I'm ready.  Present.  Okay, here he is.  Are you ready?  Okay, here we go.  Hello.  Hold on.  He was so close to hanging up.  Yes, uh, Andrew.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Do you understand I'm here with the Salvation Army?  Yeah.  Who's been here since day one at Ground Zero taking care of things? 
[01:40:30]  Right.  And you're bothering me with this nonsense?  Yeah, Dice, we realize that.  We've been here since September 11th.  Do you understand there's nowhere in New York you could go without getting a ticket now?  Because I'm with the police sergeant, and he told me so.  Oh, sure.  What day is this?  October 1st?  I got the complete police.  Yeah, right?  Looking for you.  It's September 30th or something.  All of a sudden, Dice is down there.  Dice.  Yeah.  You could have visited a lot sooner than this. 
[01:41:00]  The entire police department is looking for you guys.  Right.  Right as we speak.  What is he talking about?  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  You're losing us.  Whatever you park.  What are you doing down there?  I'm a ticketed.  Whatever you walk, you get ticketed.  What are you doing down there?  Do you understand how it works?  I'm going to put on special police operations lieutenant.  See how he goes.  Windcloth.  See how he goes.  You just keep going.  You hear what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Dice.  Dice. 
[01:41:30]  You hear me?  Everyone knows we're pretty tight with the NYPD.  Yeah.  I don't think Andrew Dice Clay is going to change our relationship with the NYPD.  Right.  I think it's already been changed, my friend.  I got it under control.  I got a hat.  Dice.  I got a hat.  Do you understand?  Dice.  Yeah.  Okay.  What are you doing down there?  I want to put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you let the guys work?  Yeah.  I want him to talk to you.  No, don't put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you just let the guys do their job?  What are you doing down there?  Because he says you're getting a ticket now. 
[01:42:00]  What are you doing down at Ground Zero?  What am I doing down there?  Why don't you let the guys do their job?  I'm a lieutenant.  That's who I'm with.  I got the hat now.  I got the hat.  You understand?  You don't have the hat.  Let the guys do their job.  They've seen enough disaster down there.  I'm with the Salvation Army.  Right.  I'm with the lieutenant.  And I got the hat.  Okay.  I think you're the last celebrity to get an NYPD hat, by the way.  Holy ass.  I have to see another celebrity with an NYPD hat. 
[01:42:30]  Do you have the FDNY hat, too, Dice?  Stay there.  I'm all set now.  You have the FDNY hat?  If I have to see another Asian guy that's obviously not on the job with an NYPD hat,  I'm going to kill myself.  Did they give you a patch with the towers and never forget?  I got to talk to somebody right now.  I'm going to put happy on for a second.  No, don't put happy on for me.  Dice.  Put down for me.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  What happened?  He's having a nervous breakdown, I think.  Happy face.  Yeah, this is happy face.  Where is the legend? 
[01:43:00]  The legend is taking care of meeting and greeting people.  Meeting and greeting people.  Do you understand that he's a legend and everybody wants to shake hands?  Absolutely.  There must be at least nine people there.  Absolutely.  There are literally hundreds of people here right now taking pictures of his chiseled chin,  admiring his dimples, and just wanting to touch his body.  Because he is a legend.  Do you understand that?  Why do you go with the lighting?  Look at Christopher's face.  He has sold out Madison Square Garden. 
[01:43:30]  Why is this looking like Jesus Christ?  Did he sell it?  Right.  He has played every major area in the country.  Did he sell Madison Square Garden this year?  He has a pay-per-view special.  What is this year?  It's the garden.  Did he sell it?  Madison Square Garden.  That's why he's a legend.  Christopher, stay human, okay?  See, this is your future if you start to...  Maybe.  Happy face.  Start believing your own face.  Oh, happy face hung up.  He got a little upset.  All right, Rick, call back happy face.  We need Dice to talk because now Barry Williams is on the other line.  Barry Williams?  Yeah.  Yes.  Did anybody do...  No, no, it's Greg Brady. 
[01:44:00]  I know.  But he's the guy who did...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got to talk to that.  Wasn't that great?  That was great.  Hey, Greg Brady.  Barry.  The legend there?  No.  No, the legend is meeting people now.  He's meeting and greeting.  He's meeting and greeting in the middle of Ground Zero.  We're very close to getting both of you on the phone at the same time.  I have a spectacular offer for it.  Yeah, so you could ask Dice if he wants to be part of the next celebrity boxing thing.  He's got to get in the ring.  Barry wants Dice to fight a chick.  Well, not just a chick.  Who, who, who, who?  China.  China. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, oh.  From the WWF.  All right, hold on.  We might have Dice back on the line here.  She goes for the junk, though.  Oh, yeah.  She does that punch.  She does.  Dice.  Dice.  No, this is Happy Face.  It's not Dice.  Happy, put on Dice, please.  I can't.  He's a legend.  He's taking care of things.  You understand that people want to meet him?  No.  No, see, obviously, you guys, you say, you think this is the problem.  I got, you know, I just can't.  I can't.  I got to go.  Happy Face.  Happy Face.  He's hanging up now.  He's hanging up now.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  Dice is hanging up.  All I can say, I mean, I can't be sure, but he's got to know I'm on the line.  He's got to know this offer's coming.  Rick, one more.  Maybe he's ducking it.  Yeah, one more time, Rick.  That's it.  That's what he's using.  Tell Happy Face that Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady, wants to make Dice an offer.  We're trying to help Dice out.  Come on.  Yeah, like they helped Vanilla Ice out, the last celebrity boxer.  Like they helped.  The last celebrity down at Crown Zero.  Who knew that Vanilla Ice couldn't fight?  What are you talking about, Willis?  Did you see him bouncing around like a juver?  He thought he was in the prison shower again. 
[01:45:30]  He was fighting for his manhood.  Barry, did you watch it?  I mean, I tuned in late.  I didn't get to see you and Danny, but Danny.  Barry was too busy at the hospital trying to wake up.  But that ain't fair, though, because Bonaduce was just training like every day.  I did like the other half like two weeks before.  But Barry's a friend of ours.  Yeah, he's a martial artist.  We should have some fun with him.  He's a martial artist.  I mean, I wouldn't go in the ring with Bonaduce.  No way.  All that anger from his career, and then on top of knowing martial arts, well.  You know what else he did?  He stopped taking his mood-elevating drugs about three weeks before.  Oh, he did.  He pulled the...  He was, like, totally zoned.  He pulled the Tyson. 
[01:46:00]  Because we were talking.  A buddy of mine is a martial arts instructor and trained me.  And, man, I got to tell you, man, I don't know if I'd have stepped in the ring with him.  Yeah.  You had a lot of guts, man.  A lot of guts.  Who knew Greg Brady?  Johnny Bravo could do it.  Johnny Bravo.  Do you hate being called Greg Brady, man?  Does it just bug you?  No.  I prefer Keith Partridge.  We have Christopher Titus in the studio, Barry.  Yeah, I know.  I have a fan.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  Me, too, man.  Thank God.  I mean, you know, I grew up on you.  Barry has fully accepted the fact that he will...  I've embodied it. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And he's actually done a great job having fun with it.  He put out an album with Johnny Bravo.  Yep.  A Johnny Bravo album, which we played...  It's part of what I'm touring with right now.  Yeah.  Excellent.  Now, Barry, do you put the jacket on, the little vest?  I do when I do Johnny's back and the shades.  Johnny's back.  Ready to rock your town tonight.  Yeah.  I can't get the picture of Dice out of my mind.  With the big NYPD hat on.  The last guy.  Actually, he's the second to last, because I believe... 
[01:47:00]  Carrot Top is going to make his way down to ground zero to complete the entire celebrity gamut.  All right.  At least Emo Phillips went early.  Dice.  Who do you want?  What happened?  We want Andrew Dice Clay, please.  You want the American legend.  We need him to speak with Barry Williams, who is on the phone with us right now.  Happy days, we'd like to speak to the funniest comic of all time, the American legend, Andrew Dice Clay.  All right.  You see, other people know he's a legend.  I'm telling you.  All right.  We're not denying it, man.  Let's all calm down.  We're trying to do a radio show here, and we've got to move on. 
[01:47:30]  Legend of Pips.  Let's get...  Okay.  Hang on.  The legend just may be ready now.  Hang on.  All right.  Okay.  Here he is.  Oh, thank God.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Opie.  Dice.  Opie.  Do you understand?  I'm on with Tom Kennedy.  We're talking about hats.  We're saying I'm over here.  This is how friendly we are.  He's over somewhere, and I'm over here.  Oh, my God.  Can we talk like that to each other?  Can just please...  And he's going, I don't see...  Please, can I pray?  Please, can one more piece of debris just fall? 
[01:48:00]  Something that was precariously perched on the top of one of the buildings that...  Please, one more piece of debris.  One brick.  That's all we need.  Very well.  I don't see ONA walking around with the hat.  Hey, Dice.  Dice.  I went down to ground zero three weeks after the event by myself in the middle of the night.  No one knew I was there.  Says to me, we give you the hat.  Not ONA.  He's going with the hat.  All right, Dice.  We have Greg.  Tom Kennedy gave me the hat with the lieutenant. 
[01:48:30]  I understand.  Dice, we have the real Greg Brady on the line.  Right.  Barry Williams from...  You remember Barry?  Yeah, I love Barry.  He's very nice.  With a proposition for you and your fine career.  But the thing is, we're sorry, he don't got the hat either.  Right.  So, I don't see him down here.  You know, the hat bit's a little old.  I'm the one down here with Tom Kennedy and the lieutenant.  All right.  We understand.  Dice, Dice.  Here's Barry Williams, Dice.  Let me talk to you for just a second.  First of all, I've been down to three times. 
[01:49:00]  I'm talking about something.  Listen, it's a very patriotic thing that you're doing down there.  Now, when you think about what went on, it gets you mad, doesn't it?  Who am I talking to?  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams, you dick.  Television said, I'm not in show business right now.  Right now, I am down.  Stop listening.  At Ground Zero with the lieutenant.  And the hat.  I know, in the hat.  And the hat.  The whole Kennedy clan is it.  Carlos Shesky. 
[01:49:30]  Well, whatever.  Look, I know a lot of people that work down at the side at Ground Zero.  I know a lot of them listen to the show.  Could you please, one of the crane operators, could you just lower something heavy on Dice?  Please, right now.  He's standing right there.  Lower one of those big toolbox things.  Or one of those big wrecking balls.  Just drop it on Dice.  Please drop it on Dice.  Or pick him up and dump him in the river.  Could you just dump him?  Move the bull mom over.  Dump him in the Hudson.  Could you please just dump him in the river? 
[01:50:00]  Just lift him up in the air a few hundred feet.  Please.  Make it look like an accident.  Barry.  Barry.  Barry.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Barry Williams.  Please speak with Andrew Dice Clay.  Dice, I just want to say that I think it's great what you're doing down there.  But it has to get you mad when you think about what happened.  It does.  And call you with an offer.  Gets us mad that the Port Authority Police Department doesn't get enough help.  Oh, who is this now?  How much work we've been doing down here.  Oh, Christ on a pony. 
[01:50:30]  Where is Dice?  Get Dice.  Dice is standing by with us, shoulder to shoulder with the Port Authority Police Department, sir.  Why do you have to be on the phone to try to get more credit?  We all know the Port Authority, you know, lost...  Oh, I hate this crap.  Get Dice on the phone.  All right, all right.  Calm down, man.  Dude, let it go for a second.  If you get this putz off and put somebody on who's reputable, okay?  Then I'll put Dice on.  Get Dice on the phone.  Put Dice on the phone. 
[01:51:00]  I'll explain in a minute.  I'm so sick of people that are pissed off because they're not getting enough credit.  Well, that's it.  With this whole Ground Zero thing and the terrorist attacks.  I know.  That's not credit, sir.  It's simply a matter of getting the information out.  I'm going to put Dice on, and then I'm sending 20 cops down to lock your ass up.  Put Dice on.  I don't understand why you have to call to try to get credit for a job that you're doing.  Obviously, I should be the one that's the mayor at this point.  Oh, God.  Please make a visit down here.  I'm coming down with the... 
[01:51:30]  Make him the mayor, and then please, can we have the first mayor of New York assassinated?  Please.  I'm coming down with 20 cops.  It's making a year for my family.  Dice.  And you're going to get frisked and sentenced.  Dice.  What do you think?  I'm a moron.  Barry, Barry, instead of trying to get him in the spirit of it, I think you're going to have to go directly to the offer.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Nobody believes in it.  Dice.  Dice.  I am there with the Kennedys and the...  Oh, my God.  Dice.  Barry Williams has an offer for television for you. 
[01:52:00]  Money.  I'm here with Lieutenant M. Winslow.  Do you understand Lieutenant M. Winslow?  Help your fame.  There will be money.  Lieutenant M. Winslow.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  He's my superior.  He is my answer to it.  Dice.  Oh, my God.  Dice.  Christopher Titus here.  Dice.  Who's there?  Christopher Titus.  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  You ain't no cop.  I am a police general officer.  I get it, man.  Look, Barry Williams has an offer.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  He is definitely having a nervous breakdown.  We are listening to Dice in the midst of a nervous breakdown. 
[01:52:30]  Let's all just sit back and listen.  Perhaps seeing Ground Zero was the last straw.  I have work to do in the city.  I drive around in a rink in old school.  Dice, you're having a nervous breakdown.  Seek help.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  I will arrest you and put you in jail, and I will have Lieutenant Winslow send you with  the Judge Kennedy.  You understand what I can have done now? 
[01:53:00]  Dice, you're a madman.  My name is Bloomberg.  Where is bad back Bloomberg?  I want to talk to the mayor.  You know what I mean?  I'm seeing sodas down here.  I'm seeing open bottles of water.  I want to see good stuff.  I highly recommend you see Dice at the Beacon Theater tonight, because I truly believe  it will be the last time he'll be on a stage.  We're not entertaining the boys anymore.  Dice, Dice, I think hawking for the workers down there is pretty much done with. 
[01:53:30]  You know, they're getting everything they need.  Maybe if you're there in October, maybe if you were in New York during the event, and  in the months following it, you would understand what was going on, instead of being the self-centered  guy that you are.  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, why didn't you just wait until the buildings  were built back up? 
[01:54:00]  Why didn't you just wait until they just built the buildings again?  And then show up.  I am so glad.  Lieutenant Bloomberg and Captain Lieutenant Winslow.  Hey, Dice, why don't you go to Pearl Harbor?  I hear something horrible happened there a while ago.  Help those people.  You live in your own little world.  Jesus, Dice, go to Cape Canaveral.  I hear one of the shuttles exploded.  No, no, no, no.  Go down there.  Pay your respects.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Holy Christ. 
[01:54:30]  What is he talking about?  On the air, as long as you abide by the rules of life, people will welcome to Maine.  Dice, Dice, go to the harbor.  The Titanic was supposed to come in, but it sank.  Pay your respects.  There's nothing here.  Hey, these people need warm clothes.  The survivors of the Titanic, they need warm clothes.  Help them out here.  I'm here with the people from White Star Lines.  The White Star Lines people had a hard time. 
[01:55:00]  Their ship sank, and these people, the survivors, are cold.  They need blankets.  Send them down there.  I'm going to Jersey.  I'm going to Lakehurst, New Jersey.  I hear a blimp exploding.  The people are hurt.  They need help and support.  The human bag out of humanity.  I can't look.  Holy Jesus.  My God.  It's unbelievable.  That was...  Barry?  Yeah.  We were close that time.  We were close. 
[01:55:30]  We were pretty close.  This might not be the most opportune moment.  I'm not sure.  He has lost his mind.  He's having...  O'Leary's cow burnt down Chicago.  Please, people need homes.  Please, people need homes.  By the way, I don't want anyone to confuse what I was saying.  But it really pisses off, Ant and I, when people feel like they have to call the media,  you know, radio stations, TV, to try to get more credit.  We understand the tragedy.  Believe me.  What to...  Believe me.  And this isn't the first or second time this has happened. 
[01:56:00]  You know?  Yeah.  So, if you were for the Port Authority, it wasn't a stab at you, but I can't believe the  guy's, you know, calling and trying to get more credit for the Port Authority.  The Midwest is in a dust bowl.  They're in a dust bowl.  They need our help.  It's a big drought.  Hey, Dice, I hear there's a hurricane coming off of Florida.  Yeah, it's Hurricane Andrew.  Please hurry.  Help.  Gah!  I don't think anybody doubts your respect for the Port Authority.  Crack a tower.  It's erupting. 
[01:56:30]  The people of Pompeii.  They're all stuck in Iraq over here.  Oh, my God.  They need your help.  At least you made it funny.  I got the hat.  I got the Mount St. Helens hat.  Run for your lives, people.  Run for your lives.  Mount St. Helens erupted.  Run for your...  Look, I got the Washington State Police hat.  I'm here with Officer Kennedy.  Mount St. Helens.  Run, people.  Look at the ash. 
[01:57:00]  I'm the biggest ash here.  I'm an ash hole.  Well, you know, he's a fellow comic, people, so I'm just going to sit here quiet.  Of course.  No, as a fellow comic, everyone could go find dice.  But he's on it.  I've never heard him that out of his mind.  He is completely...  He lost his mind somewhere.  Yeah.  Christopher, has it been doing it for a while?  Yeah, yeah.  Ever since we've been doing this program.  Wow.  He's lost his mind somewhere.  Wow.  Remember, he'd come up on stage, you know, hickory-dickory-dog, you know, he'd do his 
[01:57:30]  things, and his cigarette smoke, and I'm on the line with this chick in the bank, and  she's got a tongue.  Oh!  Yeah.  Now, he does what you just heard.  He babbles, incoherent.  That's his show?  You don't even know what he's talking about.  Yes!  Oh, you guys aren't actually helping the ticket sales at the Beacon Theater.  No, no, absolutely.  The place will be packed tonight, because it could be his last show ever.  Because you will see a man having a nervous breakdown tonight.  Oh, my God.  You will see a man having a nervous breakdown at the Beacon Theater.  I know MTV wants to take advantage of that whole Ozzy Osbourne show. 
[01:58:00]  Kennedy's been shot!  Kennedy's been shot!  MTV should follow Dice around with cameras.  There's your next hit, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See the real Dice when he's not on the stage.  It's kind of sad.  Greg Brady.  I think the first episode should be down to Ground Zero with him, though.  Oh, man.  That seems to be a touchstone for him.  I think that's his next album.  Ground Zero with Dice.  I think that's the next album.  All I could do is apologize, Barry. 
[01:58:30]  I actually thought, silly me, please hit me with a goddamn ball-peen hammer in the head.  I thought he would shut up for enough time where you could actually get a word in it.  At least to spill out the offer.  Yeah.  And we all, we definitely don't want to ever forget what happened.  Right.  But I felt like it was, like, October 1st.  A little self-serving.  For the last half hour.  Yeah.  I've been sitting over here thinking maybe Christopher would like to put on the gloves.  Man, you know what?  I still have a show.  It's not a has-been, Barry.  I still have a show on television.  Yeah, right?  Maybe after three, ten years. 
[01:59:00]  No, no, no.  Ten years from now.  Let's talk.  My career's on fire again now.  It is, man.  You handled it well, dude.  He was, he's like a fighter.  Yeah, Barry.  You did a good job, man.  That's not a lot.  More people call me Barry now than ever in my life.  That's true, right?  That's you, Ant.  That's not a low blow.  I wish I had half the career you had, my friend.  Yeah.  And half the gash.  That's right.  All right.  He got some Marsha Brady.  All right, Doug.  Yeah.  Barry, do we hang up on you?  And if we get Dice back, do we try to call you? 
[01:59:30]  Poor Barry.  Like, he doesn't have something to do.  I'll be listening with faded breath.  All right.  All right.  Go get a hat.  The offer's still there.  And Christopher, we should talk.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right, man.  Thank you, Barry.  See you, guys.  All right.  It's like the hat got one laugh, and then he just couldn't.  And then he, that's what he does.  Oh, my God.  The hat got a laugh, and it's like to stay up.  He wants to annoy you.  You should see him.  If you go to the beach tonight, he will go up to some guy and go, look what color pants  you're wearing.  Beige.  And then he'll go off for 20 minutes on the guy's beige pants. 
[02:00:00]  Because beige is.  You want to run up onto the stage and punch him in the face.  Wow.  Punch me.  By the way, this is the guy who's like on your team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that sad?  I'm glad I'm not.  I'll be calling you like three years crazy from L.A.  Just insane.  Just ranting.  Insane.  Dice having a nervous breakdown.  That's what we're hearing.  And this just in.  Dice is jumping on a plane.  He's going to go to Oklahoma City.  I hear they had a problem with a building.  Blew up.  There was people.  Oh, save the children. 
[02:00:30]  Save the children.  I'm asking everyone, send diapers for the children.  And then he's heading over to Columbine.  Oh, my God.  There's a problem there.  We got to save the kids.  I got a hat.  That makes everything okay, I think.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  Charles Lindbergh needs help finding the baby.  There's a ladder out his window.  Someone stole his baby.  He's an American hero.  I got a Lindbergh hat. 
[02:01:00]  I got a Lindbergh.  Oh, man.  Well, uh.  The redcoats are coming.  The redcoats are coming.  Oh.  Two if I land.  One if I see.  Three if I had.  Goddamn Dice, man.  Nothing funnier than him losing his friggin' mind.  Engines are coming.  Custer, look out.  Watch your scalp, Custer.  You daffy bastard. 
[02:01:30]  You put your hat on.  Put your hat on.  So they can't scalp you.  Hey, it's Dice here.  No, it's not.  Don't worry.  It's no Trojan horse or nothing.  Yeah.  Dice here, open the door.  Open the door.  I got a hat.  It's the Trojan hat.  Well, I hear Rock Hudson is sick, huh?  What is it?  A flu?  He's got the flu bug.  Oh, wow. 
[02:02:00]  I love watching him have a nervous breakdown.  It's perfect.  Hey, Kennedy, talk.  Kennedy, look out.  I think, wow.  Hey, Adam, that was really fun.  It was a lot of fun.  You got it when you're hearing somebody actually having a nervous breakdown.  To wrap it up, go right to the beginning.  Hey, Adam, don't eat that apple.  Adam, what are you doing?  He's going to bite it and we'll have eternal damnation or something. 
[02:02:30]  There's a snake.  He's a snake.  Don't listen to the snake.  Snake, cut the snake.  I'll make the skin into a hat.  Eve, what a hooah.  Yes.  She's a hooah.  She's going to ruin it for everybody.  Hey, Noah, build the ark.  It's raining.  It's going to be drowning here, people.  Put on a rain hat.  All right, man.  That was probably one of the best improv radio bits I've seen.  Thank you.  I've done a lot of radio, man.  And that was really funny.  And it's sad that I wasn't involved in it.  Moving on. 
[02:03:00]  Whatever.  Well, what happened?  Is he on medication?  He should be.  What happened?  The guy should be.  Guys, I'm not kidding.  I'm like, he's a fellow comic.  So I'm like, dude, what happened?  I'm so glad you know that.  I need some Paxil.  Maybe some Thorazine.  I think he's convinced it's funny or something.  We don't know.  We don't know what he's done.  We don't understand what he's going for.  And Christopher, we've talked about this.  Repeating the same joke over and over is not funny.  It's vaudeville.  Right.  Vaudeville. 
[02:03:30]  We've talked about this.  It's vaudeville in the past.  I'm in New York.  I don't mean to rip dice, but I mean, it's like.  Right.  We've talked about this, though.  Me and Obie sit there and go, why does he call up and just go on and on and not stop?  No matter what you say, you go, okay, guys, we got it.  But let's talk about this.  It ain't a hat.  It keeps going.  You want to reach into the phone and pull his head out and punch him.  And someone has a Big Bang joke on like this.  That's great. 
[02:04:00]  What are you doing?  Big Bang.  Big Bang.  And it made the universe.  It's in constant motion.  It ain't ending.  You know, because you could say, if it's never ending, what's at the end of it?  Let's say there's a hat.  What's beyond the hat?  Another hat.  Oh.  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, man.  He's like freaking the Nostradamus of comedians.  He's doing comedy in Quatrain. 
[02:04:30]  Isn't he amazing?  But it's the same Quatrain over and over.  God.  Listen, Anthony, I'm glad that you said what you said about the police because, you know,  I'm not a firefighter.  And I really didn't like the police department before September 11th.  But I was so sick.  Every time you heard FDNY mention, you had to hear NYPD or Port Authority Police Department.  You know, when you look at who died and the number of people that were in each department,  per capita, the fire department lost so much more people. 
[02:05:00]  And your dad, you see, NYPD.  I don't have anything.  I don't like measuring it that way.  You know what I'm saying?  I ain't going to say that.  It was a tragedy for everybody.  Everyone that died there deserves as much recognition as the next guy.  So I'm not even going to get into that argument.  You know what?  Those fire department guys, per capita, lost more.  You know something?  A disaster like this, the words per capita should never come up.  It's a little too technical.  It's not a contest.  It's not a contest.  It's not a contest.  It's like a tragedy.  I mean, even in L.A., when we were watching it, it was the same tragedy for everybody. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  And no one's, you know, I ain't going to get into it.  It's not a contest.  But the police department, who lost less guys, make it sound like...  Look, Anthony, thank you for your call.  I'm not going to sit here and debate how many more died in one thing.  You're ridiculous.  More people died.  Now you understand why we got pissed off at the guy from the Port Authority.  It's like...  It's not a contest.  No, it's not a contest.  Those guys lost more guys.  They're more important.  No, I don't think...  We all know who lost people. 
[02:06:00]  And believe me, it's very important to everybody.  What about the cooks that lost their lives?  But it's from windows of the world.  I mean, everyone.  You know, it comes down to me.  It's all one group.  It's all Americans.  Right.  With hats.  It doesn't come down to...  With hats.  A lot of them had hats, and I don't want to separate those people from the rest.  Safety dance.  Men without hats, did that.  All right, we're hanging with Christopher Titus.  Man.  Very funny guy.  He's going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  This has been the oddest...  I've never...  It's just been an odd show.  Chris, you guys should probably...  There's a girl that's been, like, molested by his 97-year-old guy. 
[02:06:30]  We have to get her to rape...  We get her to rape counts, and then Dice flips out on the phone.  Dice having a nervous break.  See, you...  You got a guy yelling about the Port Authority.  It got so serious.  I'm like, you know...  But, yeah, trust me.  The show's funny.  Maybe you didn't hear it today, but I promise...  You know what?  Ask.  He saw it.  He saw it.  Very funny.  We might have to...  We might have to replay what we did to Linda Lovelace's older show.  Oh, jeez.  Please, we forgot that happened today.  Oh, okay.  Chris, that is coming in.  More tragedy.  More tragedy and painful yelling.  Come on.  Every time I'm...  No, not at all. 
[02:07:00]  You're having fun, right?  Oh, yes.  All right.  That's all that matters.  Let's rock.  You guys are able.  You sound like a flutie stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  Oh, my God.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Everybody else talks sports and they're a genius.  I'm an idiot.  And I just know more sports than they do.  And I bring it in a different flavor.  It's called Give Me the Bungie Flavor. 
[02:07:30]  Sports in the Morning with Pharrell.  Live at 545.  1027.  WNEW.  Ah, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Why you want to burn fat when people are starving?  I'm going to get everyone together, musicians,  and we're going to sing a song about the starving Africans.  Oh, no, they did that already.  We are the world.  We all wear hats.  Oh!  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  That's right.  Yeah, works 45 minutes. 
[02:08:00]  Something they don't need in Ethiopia.  You feel its effects.  Stacker 2, you eat what you want.  You just eat less of it.  Oh!  Oh, man.  You lose weight.  You get energy.  It's the world's strongest hat burner.  What?  No, fat.  Fat.  Fat.  Fat.  Fat hat.  I'm here with Officer Kennedy.  All right.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Call them up.  1-800-LITELINE.  1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Go to their website, stacker2.com. 
[02:08:30]  Or get it at GNC, Rite Aid, Eckerts, CVS, Dwayne Reed.  Ought to find stores.  Can I get a hat there?  All right, nice, nice.  Stacker 2.  Oh!  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  And in studio, Christopher Titus.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Christopher Titus playing Caroline's.  But, Christopher, I've got to go back to the phone because Andrew Dice, Clay calling back. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, God.  Not again.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up, Dice?  I'm very busy.  Baby Jessica's caught in the well, and I've got to help her get out.  People, we need to spread the word.  Those workers needed sodas and water and hats.  Baby Jessica.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's that?  Dice.  Baby Jessica is now 32 years old.  Well, then she better get out of there because it's probably getting very tight for her. 
[02:09:30]  You're a little late on that one.  Oh, wait a minute.  Just like going down to ground zero.  Oh, my God.  Tragedy.  Yeah.  I've got to head over to the Dakota.  Dakota because I hear one of the Beatles got shot.  Oh, it's a tragic day for everybody.  I've got to get over there.  Oh, but now I'm going from over here to over here now.  Dice, you'll be...  Over here in Bethlehem.  You'll be the only one outside the Dakota.  That happened a long time ago.  Yeah.  I mean, there'll be tourists out there because they're there every effing day taking pictures 
[02:10:00]  of the place, but...  I've got to go to Bethlehem.  You're going to Bethlehem.  Oh, my God.  Look at this poor guy up on the cross.  And they're nailing him up there.  Someone help the man.  Give him some water or something.  And then look at...  Oh, no.  They're putting thorns on his head.  Just give him a hat.  You don't put thorns on their head.  You give him a police hat.  An NYPD hat.  NYPD.  Yeah.  Oh!  And, ladies and gentlemen, that was another episode of Quantum Dice. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, it's Quantum Dice.  Hey, Quantum Dice.  I'm Dr. Dice Beckett.  I go back in history.  I leap.  They call it leaping.  And I've got to fix mistakes in history.  So everything's okay now.  See, that's what I do.  I got a happy face for a hologram that helps me out.  And sometimes I communicate with Club Soda Zinky.  You know, a happy face hits the little light thing and says, I got to help out here. 
[02:11:00]  Some days I wake up.  I look in the mirror after I leap.  I'm a Negro.  And I'm like a ball player.  But sometimes I'm a chick with meat curtains.  And I go, oh, I got meat curtains.  And so once, I remember once I leapt and I'm a goddamn retard.  I was a retard, but I was still nice.  But I look in the mirror, and I got a retard face. 
[02:11:30]  I go, I go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Club Soda Zinky.  I got a retard face.  But then, you know, the next day, I might be a midget.  And I hate the goddamn midgets.  Oh.  So I leap this one time, and I'm in the body of a chick, right?  And then the hell, happy face, the hologram, starts banging me.  Bop!  Bop!  His yambeg slapping against my ass. 
[02:12:00]  Oh!  Quantum dice.  Quantum dice.  Next week, dice is in the Nixon administration while Nixon's recording.  Hey, I hate the Jews, too, there, Tricky Dick.  I understand.  They're what you call shifty.  I understand.  We got to bomb the gooks in the Numb.  And for sweeps, for sweeps, dice in Saigon.  Hey, I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  How does this happen? 
[02:12:30]  I got to take a boat up the Numb River?  I got to kill some guy.  Hey, look, they napalmed the road.  This poor girl's running down and naked.  Someone help the poor girl.  I hear she's in Texas with a 97-year-old.  Ow!  Give her a hat!  All right.  Thank you, dice.  Oh, man.  I'm watching Quantum Dice.  Very nice.  That would be a great show.  Quantum Dice.  Quantum Dice.  Anthony on fire today.  Oh, come on.  Man.  Hey, Mike, what's going on, bro? 
[02:13:00]  Not to break from what I put on the screen, but I heard dice was helping with the recovery  effort of the dinosaurs.  It was a huge tragedy.  A comedy?  I got Mike.  I want to tell Chris that the show usually starts off normal, but this thing with dice  is unbelievable.  Oh, it's just gotten weird.  It's gotten weird, and you know, I'm just riding it, man.  I'm just letting it go.  Yeah, they've been following the soap opera that is Andrew Dice Clay for four years with  us.  So how long has this been going on, man?  I mean, he's got about four years.  We've been watching him slowly, but surely he'll lose it.  I'm a comic, so I don't want to rip on a guy, but it seems like he's lost his mind. 
[02:13:30]  He seems.  Well, no, but if comedy goes, most comics get on stage and they say, I remember this,  and then I was on my way to the show.  I mean, what just happened was real, and like, I don't know about anybody else, but I had  this grin on my face like I just got stoned for the first time, and I could not stop.  Yeah, because Anthony was doing exactly what we all wanted to be doing, just shut up.  I know.  He was fired up.  You should see, he was bright red.  His head was bright red.  I know.  I'm spitting into the mic.  He's screaming into the mic, and I thought, man, and then all of a sudden, boom, the brilliant  comedy comes out of you.  You got to get him fired up until like he has a vein sticking out in his head, and then  all of a sudden, there you go.  That's the key to get him fired up. 
[02:14:00]  Man.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you go.  Plenty of fun.  Quantum time.  That's fun.  That's fun.  Come on.  We're having fun today now.  It was really fun.  Well, now we can do an Alamo joke.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  We know the dice history, right?  Every time he calls now, you just do quantum dice.  Now we got to do quantum dice.  You just got quantum.  You got a bit forever.  We can always go back to the Alamo.  There's plenty of history we can work on.  Dude, you went through a textbook already.  You were like, what happened to the history of the world? 
[02:14:30]  I know.  You did like the last 200 years with dice.  Hand me a pen.  I'll sign the Magna Carta.  Doesn't anyone have a pen?  They got to sign this thing.  That's funny.  Hey, old Jimmy Norton.  Look who's on the phone.  It's old Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, after that brilliant bit, man, this awful phone call.  This is really going to stop the show.  Jimmy, where are you?  Buffalo in some bar with Voss and two young ladies.  Wait a minute.  You're with Voss? 
[02:15:00]  Voss and two young ladies, yeah.  Rich Voss?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I know Rich.  We love Rich.  Christopher Titus knows Rich Voss.  Oh, I am, man.  Have you ever laid in a bed with Rich Voss with a girl between you as you both jerked it?  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  I would say no.  No?  I'm looking at his awful little midget fingers right now.  We're now calling Voss the world's tallest midget.  Yeah, he really does have a long, awful torso.  He's got little fingers and his short little legs, but a long torso. 
[02:15:30]  And little midgety, awful, inept fingers.  What is it?  What is he doing?  We're now calling Voss Dwarf.  Dwarf.  Dwarf.  Voss on golf.  I can hardly hear you guys.  We're in a loud, awful, yucky place.  Norton.  Norton, what is Voss doing up there with you?  Is he opening?  Yeah, we're just doing a gig together.  And I couldn't get an open mic-er to come up for the money I'm paying for Voss Dwarf degree.  You want to buy a dryer door?  And you know what?  I'm such a victim of my own nonsense.  Last night at 1.30, my phone rings. 
[02:16:00]  And some guy in this awful bubble actually goes,  Hey, Norton.  And I'm like, yeah.  And he goes, click.  So some day I called my hotel and got me last night.  He totally got you.  Yeah, so if you're listening, sir, congratulations.  Very nice.  Well, that pretty much wraps up this exciting phone call.  Well, thanks for bringing it to you.  But not as excited.  Hey, did you go to the radio station today?  No, I didn't.  I stopped until 4 o'clock.  I'm not doing that.  Of course you're not.  Did you blacken out your hotel room?  Yeah, and I went to bed about 6 o'clock.  And then this stupid maid called me at 1.30, even though there's a not disturbed sign. 
[02:16:30]  Did you have company, Norton?  No, I actually looked at the local, you know, like the little local magazines.  They have, like, ads.  And I debated doing it, but I just couldn't afford to get arrested.  So I would have been in jail all weekend.  Oh, so what are those little papers, the free papers you get out of those little, you think they're newspaper machine things out on the street?  Yeah, but in the back, you got massage ads and all that stuff.  Right.  And I debated it, but that dice bit was really funny, man.  I was really enjoying that on hold.  Yeah, man.  And I knew I was just going to come in and spoil the whole flow. 
[02:17:00]  No, we were not.  Norton, you missed a real dice before that, though.  Hey, Chris, congratulations, man.  This show's a big hit.  Thanks, man.  Tell Fox.  I did a week with him at Catch a Rising Star about five years ago.  It was a very funny line.  Don't say it.  Oh, without a doubt.  He's playing Caroline's.  Oh, hell yeah.  Sorry you've got to be out on the road, man.  All right, guys.  I'll let you go.  And I know it's about to give me the, all right, we're here.  You've got to get out of here.  You've got to get out of here.  I know you've got your show to do.  I know they've got the old show to do.  All right.  Thanks for calling in.  I'm actually enjoying the uncomfortableness today. 
[02:17:30]  That's terrible.  All right.  And, boss, already, we just meet these girls.  Yeah.  And, boss, we're at the table ten minutes, and he goes, do you think my finger's broken?  And she touches his finger, and he farts on the wood chair.  Oh, my God.  Hey, yeah, that's the guy I worked with.  Did she laugh?  We all laughed, but it was awful because he farted, and his feet don't even touch the floor.  It was a horrible trip.  Dude.  I'll see you guys on Monday, man.  Hold on.  I just got to say, I lived in Buffalo for three years.  Trust me, the girls enjoyed that joke.  All right, man. 
[02:18:00]  All right, later, guys.  Have fun, man.  The good old Buffalo Bettys.  We used to call them the Buffalo Bettys.  All right, later.  All right, later, man.  They, uh, Noss and, uh, Noss.  Voss and Norton told us a story last week about how they picked up some girl, went back to a room,  and it ended up where the girl was in the middle, both of them on either side, their junk out,  and they're just cranking it.  And the girl wouldn't have sex with them, but they would just sit there and crank it. 
[02:18:30]  But this isn't gay.  Man, that's walking the line, though.  It's a little.  I tell you what, yeah.  It's just a little.  That is gay.  That's a little jerk de soleil right there.  That's a little.  I know Anthony really well.  We would never.  Never.  Voss goes, let's flip a coin.  The loser has to F her.  Like, loud.  Right there with her right there.  Yeah, that's, uh, I, I imagine my best friend, and if that was even presented if I was single.  Yeah.  No, it ain't going to happen. 
[02:19:00]  I haven't been, you know, I have a lot of friends and never has anything remotely close to that.  But you don't understand, when you're a comic on the road, and you work on the road, and it's a nightmare, man.  You work in these horrible towns, and the club owner's yelling,  you had two potato skins this week, you ain't getting another one.  Right, right.  You know, and so it comes up, and you just become this, you become this animal, and, you know, I understand it.  Animal is a good word.  So you can't judge them for being on the road, my friend.  That boss is an animal.  I'm sure they love the opera when they come into town, when they're home.  They're classy guys.  When you're on the road, all the bets are off, my friend. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, we love the guys.  Those guys are great.  We're replaying those stories tomorrow.  Oh, good.  For New York.  Stay tuned.  For our best-up show we do every Saturday from 3 to 7 here in New York.  Yes.  That and the Kid Rock interview.  You got to take off?  I got to go, man.  I got to go get a sound check.  Oh, he's giving us the signs, Anthony's giving us the signs.  Well, I'm sorry.  You guys spent so much time talking about my act, and how funny I was.  We've beaten Anthony.  Look, I will tell you.  I saw you last time.  I saw Christopher last time.  It was very funny.  And it's not just you run in the middle, you know, going there and see a comic. 
[02:20:00]  It's very funny stuff.  Intense stuff.  It's an amazing chain of events you go through that I brought to you where you are now, and it's really funny.  We got a standing ovation that you were there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Very good.  They were leaving.  Whatever it was.  Yeah, but they were standing.  I saw they were standing.  They didn't just stand up and go.  They stood up and clamped for a minute, and then they laughed.  And then they laughed.  That's how good it was.  Christopher Titus at Cowlines.  Guys, appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  I will see you later.  Good luck with the Fox thing, too.  All right, man.  I feel like better on my crew.  Hearing Dice, I feel a lot better on my crew. 
[02:20:30]  Well, you should.  Thanks, guys.  Talk to you.  All right.  Take it easy, Christopher.  There he goes.  Are we going to get to...  Take it easy, man.  Are we going to get to Rick?  We're going to finish talking.  All right.  I'm out of here.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Are we going to get to Rick's...  We really should.  Yeah, we should talk about Rick's appearance on Beverly Hills 90210.  Yes.  Rick lived out in L.A.  He did the Hollywood scene for a while.  We don't have to break yet, do we?  No.  No, I think we just did.  No, I know, but I didn't know how late we were today. 
[02:21:00]  As a matter of fact, when we were up in Boston and we first went out to L.A., Rick picked  us up in his convertible Mustang.  Do you remember that?  I'm sure you do.  I don't know if I did.  I was completely hammered when we landed.  I did.  Yeah.  We went to Johnny Rockets, had some burgers.  Yeah.  Down there in L.A.  And now Rick was doing the Hollywood thing.  He was trying to be an actor and stuff.  Let me tell you something.  I got to tell you something.  Honestly, I didn't know Rick at all.  I knew Rick was Sandy's brother.  That's all I knew of Rick.  Now, this isn't saying anything about your life now. 
[02:21:30]  Great guy.  You're leading a very good life.  Oh, my God.  You're prefacing this.  I was under the...  He's about to say something.  No, I was...  He's about to say that now I'm a loser compared to what he thought I was before.  No.  No.  But I will say I was under the impression that you were some Hollywood mover and shaker.  I swear to you.  Rick.  Opie, think about it.  First of all, I'm hammered.  We land.  Rick picks us up.  Yeah, with the latest sunglasses, the latest haircut, the latest clothes. 
[02:22:00]  He lives out in...  Where did you live?  Studio City?  No, that's where I used to live.  I was only vacationing that week.  Whatever.  I was...  Here's what I thought.  You went to an apartment.  Well, yeah.  That was my old apartment complex.  Yeah.  It was in what?  Studio City, right?  Yep.  So, he picks us up in this Mustang convertible.  He's out in Hollywood.  I'm like, who is this?  What the hell is this guy doing?  It's like Mr. Actor or something.  I hear that he's appeared in things. 
[02:22:30]  He's driving around in a nice car.  It was a rental car, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, I was on vacation.  It's like, here's my apartment in Studio City.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  And then I find out he's Rick.  After a while, time goes on.  It's like, oh, what happened to the guy?  It was just Rick.  Good old Rick.  Yeah, it was good old Rick.  This was Beaver Cleaver's house.  And leave it to Beaver.  But as we drive around, you'll see it's just two by fours holding up what we call a facade.  Or false front.  No more facades.  That's what we call a rented Mustang. 
[02:23:00]  It's a house used in quantum dice.  Quantum dice.  But then, you know, like I said, it's nothing to do with the way your life is now.  I just assumed that you were, you know, a Hollywood mover and shaker.  And then, apparently, he was.  He appeared in an episode of, a couple of episodes, right?  Or one episode of Beverly Hills.  A few episodes of Melrose.  902101 Melrose.  He's got to explain the extra thing.  He was doing the extra thing.  Yeah, he was doing the extra.  I was doing the Jeff Norris thing. 
[02:23:30]  Jeff likes to say that he's, you know, whatever.  He's an extra.  Here we go.  He's an extra.  What serial did you play?  He's a mini-wheat.  Well, that's true.  Were you a serial?  No, that's like a paid thing for him now.  Yes.  Usually, when he talks about his, you know, the mysterious gun that jumped.  When he was playing a cop in a show, it was extra work.  Extra work.  That's all it is.  So, you do extra work.  Right.  And one of the shows that you did extra work in was Beverly Hills 90210.  Very popular at the time.  At the time, sure.  What year about?  About 93, 94. 
[02:24:00]  93, 94.  Are you going to give Steve the tape so he can...  I already gave it to him.  Oh, my God.  Foundry?  Yeah.  And then, you know, Jeff could work his magic as far as maybe slowing it down, freezing it,  putting an arrow where Rick is in the scene.  Because if you blink, you'll miss it.  You'll miss it.  So, you can play it a million times and see, ah, Steve C.  You know...  How is it going to go?  Rick is barely in this scene, Anthony, that he's actually out of focus because he's so far away  from the camera.  Pivotal, though.  Actually, pivotal.  There's about a split one-tenth of a second that I am in focus, then I'm back at it. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  When you're over the guy's shoulder?  Right, right.  Yeah.  Good shot.  Good shot.  Thanks.  I think what we'll have to do is slow it down drastically into a big yellow fag, fag,  fag, fag, fag, fag across the bottom.  Well, now that brings us to what the scene was.  Yeah.  Where's the audio?  Yeah.  Right over there.  Oh, we have some of that audio to let everybody know what the scene was.  John A.  Perhaps you remember this episode if you were a 90210 fan, the one with the starring Rick. 
[02:25:00]  Let's just play the audio and pretty much tell the people that Rick is in the background.  He's in the background.  He's one of the patrons of this establishment.  Read your book.  And he's in the background looking, might I say, like he completely fits into this place.  Well, you really, you must have had to have.  That's what my part called for.  Bravo.  Exactly.  That's what actors do.  And you went all out for it.  If they asked me to be a cop, I'd call Norris for a gun.  Right.  Exactly.  All right.  So let's play a little of the audio and kind of sets the scene that Rick is in the background 
[02:25:30]  of.  Who will we be hearing audio from?  Because you weren't getting a speaking part, so we won't hear you.  Right.  But who is this?  Celebrity names.  Jason Priestley.  Jason Priestley.  Perhaps you know that name.  And Ian Zierle.  Ah, who?  Played Steve.  Played Steve?  What?  The blonde guy.  All right.  I'm not very familiar with the show, but of course, Jason Priestley.  There you go.  Let's listen.  You know, there's someone on the line, though.  Yeah.  What?  They want to know if that L.A. trip is the same trip where Dice heard Ant do Dice for 
[02:26:00]  the first time.  That's a story in itself.  I think it might have been.  Well, we'll try to tell that.  I think that was the second one.  No, that was a different one.  Yeah.  What?  No.  No.  No, that wasn't the one at the comedy store.  That was the first time we went, and that was the right time.  Remember the comedy store was like...  That's what I'm saying.  No, the other one was the car's place where...  Ah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Second trip to L.A.  Where Tupac got shot.  Right.  Second trip to L.A. is when we were introduced to Dice for the first time.  Yeah.  And we're paying for it ever since.  Still paying years later.  With this Spanky hat. 
[02:26:30]  Ah, that's right.  It was Spanky.  Maybe.  It's a whole story for maybe another day or hopefully after we get through the record.  If you remember the episode of The Little Rascals where Spanky was golfing, he had the  little knickers on, and that big Spanky hat he used to wear.  He all used to wear those.  Yeah, the big Spanky, it was like a golfer hat almost, the big puffy Jiffy Pop hat, and  Dice came in wearing one of those, and we just laughed our balls off.  Hey, Spanky.  So, here's some audio.  Rick's scene, Beverly Hills 9021. 
[02:27:00]  Now what's wrong?  No dial tone.  Great.  Hey, look, there's a coffeehouse with a payphone.  Let's go.  Coffeehouse.  Coffeehouse with a payphone.  All right, so there's two guys.  Would you like me to set the scene?  Okay.  Their car broke down.  Don't give away the...  They're at a payphone that's not working.  Payphone's not working.  They're trying to call someone to have them fix their car.  They're on their way to a Dodger game.  All right.  So, they see a coffeehouse and decide to go in and use the phone. 
[02:27:30]  Right, because it's got the little payphone sign right out front.  All right.  All right, so they're going into the car.  Sounds innocent enough.  Right.  Listen, why don't you just sit down, all right?  I'll go call the tow truck.  You order it's a cappuccino.  I don't want a cappuccino.  I want a Dodger dog, all right?  A little music, a little pool you hear in the background, playing pool.  Right now, Steve is surveying the area.  Right.  He's taking a look at the coffeehouse.  He's looking around. 
[02:28:00]  Huh?  How long has this gone on?  Well, he's starting to realize something about the clientele.  He seemed quite right in this coffeehouse.  Interesting.  Hmm.  He looks some more.  He's looking around at maybe certain things that are going on.  Whatever.  Some pictures on the wall.  Pictures on the walls, perhaps.  A little, uh, maybe different than he'd be used to.  And some establishments he goes in.  What caught your attention?  Rick in the back.  He looks at Rick and goes, hmm.  There's Rick.  Something's going on. 
[02:28:30]  He looks at Rick and goes, there's a mover and shaker in this town.  I bet he's got a rented Mustang convertible.  Good news, buddy.  So far, we'll be here in less than 20.  How would you order us?  Nothing.  Let's get out of here.  Steve, we just got here.  Just relax a minute, okay?  I'll wait outside.  It's not going to get here any faster, Steve.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me?  Don't you see anything strange about this place?  What?  Brandon, we're sitting in a gay coffeehouse. 
[02:29:00]  What?  Yeah!  Rick was an extra in the gay coffeehouse scene.  Oh, my God.  Hello, Hollywood.  Hello, Hollywood.  How's that for a topper?  Want a cappuccino?  It's called paying your dues, my friend. 
[02:29:30]  Rick, at your service.  So you are in the gay coffeehouse scene.  Out of my line eight.  This is typecasting at its best.  Ryan knows the gay coffeehouse episode.  He knew.  Even beforehand.  Ryan.  Hey, Ryan.  Hey, how are you?  Funniest thing I ever saw.  You remember that?  Oh, I remember it.  I don't really recall Rick, but I do remember the other one.  Oh, you know him now.  The strapping young buck in the background.  I'm going to FX and watching every one of them every day until it comes back on. 
[02:30:00]  All right, Ryan.  Thank you.  Take care.  Yeah.  He's just way, way back of that scene.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony wants to know if Rick was an extra in Police Academy at the Blue Oyster.  The Blue Oyster bar?  Remember that?  That was fun.  All right, let's listen a little more here.  You know, it's funny.  It doesn't really look any different.  Except that it's all guys in here.  Right.  So let's get out of here before any of them get any ideas, okay? 
[02:30:30]  Steve, will you take it easy?  They're not going to comp a feel over a cup of coffee.  Oh?  Oh?  Ryan, what is it?  Oh, just one of the brothers in the cake house.  Here, I thought I was the only one.  Are you going to say anything to him?  No, not now.  I think he's busy.  Oh. 
[02:31:00]  Gay guy at the bar saw him in there and was like, oh, he was one of the guys from, what,  his frat house?  Yeah, frat house.  And I'm sure later on, in later episodes, that got all heated and gay.  Actually, that episode.  Oh, really?  I think so, yeah.  Did he try to pick him up?  No.  Hey, I know.  I saw you at the gay coffee house.  I couldn't pick up the guy in the background, so I figured I'd...  Rick's job.  What were you...  What did they tell you now?  All right.  You, obviously, the director or somebody had to tell you where to stand and what to do.  They position you in certain places and they just say, pretend you're reading this 
[02:31:30]  magazine, which I was doing.  So you were just, you were kind of leaning, very gay-like, against the pole.  Yes, you were.  And who played the pole?  What was his name?  How do you lean gay-like?  Well, Anthony, explain.  Please explain to me how would one lean gay-like.  All right.  I could explain because I know you well enough to know that if you were acting in a scene  where you're in a gay bar and you had to play a gay guy, you would try to gay it up a bit.  Just...  And if all you're doing is standing there...  Because you might get discovered.  If all you're doing is standing there reading the magazine, you're going to try to do it 
[02:32:00]  as gay as possible.  I just know that.  And that's fine.  You're playing a gay guy.  How would one get gay on camera by reading a magazine?  I saw, by the way, you leaned and kicked your hip out.  It said, have gay sex with me.  It was...  You're reading the magazine and the way you were standing was very feminine.  I did not kick a gay hip out.  You kicked a gay hip out.  I did not.  You kind of...  You know how you kind of push your hip out if you're leaning against something in a gay fashion? 
[02:32:30]  That's what kind of you were doing.  But you were doing a good job of acting.  That's all you were doing.  I understand.  It was just acting.  Acting.  Right?  Yes.  Yes.  You had to go with...  Wait, what did the director say?  I don't know what the director said.  Did he like your work?  They basically just...  It's just a big group of guys.  Yeah.  And as they go...  I heard your line was cut out.  Coffee, tea, or me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  I'm sorry.  And they just...  Depending on where they think you would fit well...  Hey, how about a cup of Joe?  Oh, where's Joe?  Where is Joe?  All right.  Go ahead, Rick.  No, I'm not going to tell you now.  No, no, no.  Because what was going through your head?  You're sitting there, and you know you're playing a gay guy.  You were playing a gay guy.  Well, once I figured it out, I was like...  A young gay cruiser.  After I figured it out, I was like, this sucks.  I can't call anyone and tell them I'm going to be in this one.  Exactly.  So I kind of blew that one off. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, a lot of your audio was cut out, which sucks.  You know, it would have been nice to hear, but we have some of the audio.  I did have a few lines, but I never got my SAG card.  There it is.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, see, we don't want to hear that.  Oh, awful.  Very happy to be here.  The Raven wants to know if Rick was Robert Downey Jr.'s stunt double during the on-his-knee scene in Less Than Zero. 
[02:34:00]  Come on, Rick.  So were you thinking, like, all right, I got to be gay.  I got to, like, gay it up a bit.  Even though I'm just standing, reading, I got to do it in a gay fashion.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  That was a long time ago.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, Mad Max wanted a Dodger dog in his...  A Dodger dog.  Ho, ho.  In his...  Ho, ho.  Great.  Well, what did you do in Melrose?  I was straight for Melrose. 
[02:34:30]  Oh.  Yes.  I'm gay.  You are?  Yeah.  I was actually in, what was the bar?  Who were you acting with?  Who was in the scene?  Heather Locklear.  Oh.  Very close to her.  Oh.  Oh, close enough to get her pregnant.  A little callback.  I know.  That was a good one.  Heather Locklear.  Very attractive.  Dude, people watch too closely.  Joe is saying he saw this episode.  Go ahead, Joe.  With the Melrose thing or the 90210? 
[02:35:00]  90210.  90210.  Yeah, I saw it.  He also did one of those little gay hand movements.  I did not.  I did.  What gay hand movement?  As you got up to walk away, you had a little flicker.  You had to power up.  Dude, I didn't even get up and walk away.  I was standing up the whole time, Jackass.  Jackass.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Momma's boy.  Menage a 12 million.  Thank you, Joe.  Why don't we take a break, Ant?  All right.  And you know what?  We're going to spend some time playing what we learned today.  It was a very educational program today.  Very.  It's like going to college, this show today. 
[02:35:30]  We had a lot of fun this week.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of fun.  They should give credits for today's show for how much people learned.  Yeah, I think we did pretty well.  Unbelievable.  All right.  We took care of that.  We took care of that.  We took care of that.  Wow, look.  We got everything done.  Or just about.  No, it wasn't in Queer as Folk.  If these walls could talk three.  Were you the pitcher or the catcher?  And the character, what did you think you were?  Pitcher or catcher?  Did you think it out at all? 
[02:36:00]  I didn't really go.  I didn't delve that far into that particular character.  Okay, okay.  No.  I'm sorry.  I didn't.  I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  We'll do the what-do-we-learn thing next.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, this F.U. is going out to the dirty Spanish ****ers that I share a building with.  They work across the hall, and when they go to take a dump, they wipe their asses and  put the toilet paper in the trash can. 
[02:36:30]  They actually pull it out of the toilet, out from behind them, and put it in the trash  can instead of just wipe and drop.  Wipe and drop.  Walk in there, and you go, a stick.  Oh, my God.  You look at a goddamn trash can.  There's **** covered.  Toilet paper.  What the **** is wrong with you dirty ****ers?  Flush it down.  Next message.  Yeah, I got a big, super-sized F.U. to whatever bitch was driving down Route 130 today, probably  putting her makeup on and talking on the phone and picking her nose and doing all kinds of 
[02:37:00]  ****.  It's a big-ass accident, so it takes me over an hour to get to work.  It should take me like 15 minutes.  So F.U., bitch.  Next message.  I have a big F.U. out to Craig at Penn State.  Guess what?  You think there's nothing wrong with your girlfriend?  But I've been having sex with her for a week.  And guess what?  When you come home this weekend, it's going to drop you from me.  But have a good weekend.  Tag it.  Later.  End of messages.  O.P.  Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real. 
[02:37:30]  This is not an act.  Ponderous.  Effin' ponderous.  The O.P.  And Anthony Show.  Time to play What Did We Learn on The O.P.  And Anthony Show today.  Yeah.  Before we do, I want to thank Christopher Titus for stopping by.  Yes.  We love that guy.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend.  Check him out.  Very funny.  Also, I want to thank the real great Brady for calling in.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams Enterprises. 
[02:38:00]  I want to thank Dice for calling in and doing his part down at Ground Zero.  So, finally, finally, now they can, you know, move on.  Everyone can get on with their lives.  Dice has visited Ground Zero.  That's what everyone was waiting for.  Finally, we can say the terrorists haven't and can never win.  Campbell from Jersey.  Brilliant, my friend.  I learned that Sacramento is finding out right now that a 97-year-old man is capable of rape. 
[02:38:30]  Right now, is it that early?  The guy figured it out.  He did the equation, Anthony.  Wow.  That's about right.  How about that?  How about that?  Today's show flew by.  Yeah.  I learned Rick's not gay.  He just plays one on TV.  That's it?  Of course.  Patrick, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, bro.  Dude, I learned that, oh, Jesus, I'm blanking out. 
[02:39:00]  Sorry.  I learned that Good Cop, Bad Cop worked all week long.  We don't play Good Cop, Bad Cop all week long, huh?  I also learned that, oh, you lost some of that psycho factor because you got a guitar and crabs and didn't smash either one.  The crabs were tasty.  I bet.  You smashed the crabs.  I forgot.  We want to thank Washington, WJK, for sending us some really, really good crabs today.  Nice box of crustacean hands. 
[02:39:30]  And celebrating the fine ratings we got in D.C.  Right?  Right.  I heard Stinky ate a whole bag.  Whole bag of hands.  A whole bag of crabs for Stinky.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Awesome, Garrett.  Bring them all up.  Awesome, Garrett.  Mary.  Come on.  Get a good one.  I learned if you go chasing waterfalls, wear your seatbelt.  Oh, boy.  Ouch.  Oh. 
[02:40:00]  Ouch.  Oh, oh.  Ouch.  Oh.  YV from Queens.  I learned that Opie, a.k.a.  Baby Evil, isn't as vile as Anthony, a.k.a.  Uncle Evil.  Oh.  Uncle Evil.  Bro from Jersey.  I learned there is a hat behind the hat.  The hat.  Jerry from Edison.  I learned 30 cc's will give you 11 hours of black junk.  And he also learned, coming to TV next fall, Quantum Dice.  I learned about two years ago, Norton and his great-grandfather were in Texas. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I didn't even read that one.  I just said it.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  Jersey Gary.  Learned today on Ahab Crabs.  He also learned there's an escapee from Bellevue wandering around Ground Zero.  He also learned nothing says I love you like thrusting a needle into your mule to have  sex.  Ugh.  And finally, having a hat solves everything for a lunatic. 
[02:41:00]  Nervous breakdown.  Well, what do you call it?  The nervous breakdown.  That's right.  Uh, Vinny.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, bro?  Hey, yeah.  Today I learned Dice is the newest super friend.  Super friend.  That's right.  He was there with his superhero jacket on like he wears?  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  You suck.  I, Vinny.  He wears the biggest jackets.  I don't even know how, like, do they have a superstructure under them that make them  bigger?  He puts them on and they're, I'm huge. 
[02:41:30]  It makes them look huge.  He's down at the trade center site today.  He goes down there and I'm just, you know, in this huge superstructure outfit.  I don't think that's...  I'm a little...  What?  Hey, I'll stop there.  What?  Oh, I'm late?  I could have saved everyone.  I don't think it's a really big jacket.  I think he's inside a mascot uniform or something.  Is that, yeah, it's like a mascot uniform.  Look, I wave to the crowd.  I do a dance to music.  Who let the dice out? 
[02:42:00]  Who let the dice out?  Scotty.  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, hey.  Hey.  I learned a few things today, man.  All right.  I learned about porno stars.  You can't say porno stars, but you can play a whole lot of funny noises.  Yeah, no, just don't say it.  I forgot we did that earlier.  Don't say it.  Just hang up.  Yep.  I learned you guys are like Maury Povich.  Mm.  And that Rick came out of the closet.  Well, on TV.  Yeah, on TV.  On TV.  Oh, well, yeah.  Speaking of Maury Povich, I think he's going to be in next week. 
[02:42:30]  How great is this, Scotty?  What's that?  Maury Povich will be on the show next week.  Is coming on our show.  Oh, get out of here.  He has heard that we're big fans here.  And I hear he's a fan of the show.  Right.  That's what I hear.  You've got to bring Dr. Paddy in.  A lot of these guys say they're a fan of the show, and then you get them in here and realize they have no clue who we are.  But he called us.  Oh, they sent us a tape of a...  Yeah.  Well, there's just a few things I want to ask Maury. 
[02:43:00]  Right.  That's all.  Oh, yeah.  I'll sit down and talk to him about some of his programs.  Yeah.  We can't wait to see Norton tonight in Buffalo, man.  All right.  Are you calling from Buffalo?  Oh, yeah, man.  Oh, you're going to have a great time.  You're going to laugh your balls off.  Definitely.  We have a big crowd going, man.  A bunch of guys in that.  Cool.  Hey, you guys have a good one.  Thank you, Scotty.  Hey, take care.  All right.  Peace.  And after Voss does his act, forget about it.  Norton's just going to look even better.  Buffalo's going to find out tonight that Voss is really funny.  I know. 
[02:43:30]  And that sucks.  We have to say it from time to time because he takes a lot of abuse on this show.  It does suck that Voss is really funny.  Voss going to all the cities like that and performing.  Then people realize, wait a minute, he's funny.  He's funny.  And our joke.  Well, our joke is still funny.  Yeah.  Chris, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that Rick kicked out a gay hip.  And Norton and Voss like skiing.  Yeah.  And Dice turned into cringe radio.  Yeah.  All right.  I got to go to work, man.  With what?  Officer Kennedy and he's running the city.  He said hi to Lieutenant Bloomberg. 
[02:44:00]  I will have to listen to that tape just to hear what he was talking about.  Because it's either he's going to have us arrested.  Yeah.  It's the most babble I've ever heard.  All right.  Gus, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned today that Quantum Dice speaks in redundant quatrains.  And one is by land, two is by sea, three is by hat.  Very nice.  Three is by hat.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  Bye.  I'm suffering from certain delirious dromemia. 
[02:44:30]  Hey.  Anthony, our pals are coming to town.  Days of the New.  They're playing the Mercury Lounge this Monday night.  A few tickets are available now at the Mercury Lounge box office.  Or go to www.mercurylounge.com.  But it hurts.  We got a pair of tickets to give away to someone who's into Days of the New, Anthony.  Yes.  And with that, I guess we got to say so long and have a great weekend and all that.  Right.  And happy birthday, my friend.  What?  I know, but happy birthday, Anthony.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  No jokes. 
[02:45:00]  Just happy birthday.  All right.  Absolutely.  Have a good weekend.  We had a lot of fun this week on the radio, guys.  We did.  Thank you so much for the support.  We greatly appreciate it.  Going through some weird times these days.  It's just amazing.  But we're having some fun, all right?  Right.  The FU line is packed.  So why don't we go to the FU line one more time and then we'll see you on Monday.  The bro-me line.  What's wrong, Rick?  The way you were talking, I thought we'd have to break out the Hulk walking away music.  Oh, no.  We were all, you know, we got to get serious.  It was made us angry.  It's very strange.  We're taking a call with a big wig on Monday. 
[02:45:30]  We don't know what that's about.  An actual wig of giant size?  Is that what you're talking about?  Am I just picturing a giant, hair-like object?  No?  We have a conference call with someone in upper management and those calls are never good.  So we don't know.  It's never like, hi, how you doing?  What's up?  No, just go.  What's up?  All right.  All right.  Bye.  FU line.  We'll see you Monday at 3.  Live.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opin' Anthony FU line.  I want to give a big FU out to all these kids that drive around in their Hondas and all these 
[02:46:00]  little cars and they put the fins on it that belongs to an airplane and the little side  effects with the silver trim.  I can't stand them.  FU!  Next message.  Yeah, this is Mike from Philly.  I want to give a big f***ing use to all the stupid ass in the city.  Don't know how to f***ing drive on Roosevelt Boulevard.  The goddamn speed limit is 45, not 20, and there's no sign that there's a break every 20  seconds to annoy the person behind you.  Learn to f***ing drive, pinch my ass, and suck my f***ing mule. 
[02:46:30]  Next message.  I want to send a big, fat, stinking, sloppy FU to the company that I work for for making  me move to another state and promise of a job that all of a sudden is not going to happen.  Hey, thanks a lot for making me move 100 miles away, so now I drive 100 miles to the  job that I used to live five minutes around the corner from.  FU.  End of messages. </pre>
