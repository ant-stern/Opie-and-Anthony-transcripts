<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Joe Rogan as a guest, promoting his new season of *Fear Factor*.  The conversation began with a discussion about the vastness of space and branched into philosophical and scientific concepts including parallel universes, reincarnation, and the observer effect in quantum physics, illustrated by the double-slit experiment.  Humorous tangents and off-color jokes punctuated the discussion. Rogan also mentioned his upcoming appearances on the *Today Show* and *Fear Factor*. A commercial break featured a Pat Cooper bit on erectile dysfunction.  The hosts and Rogan discussed Michael Jackson's life and death, speculating about his physical alterations and personal life, before shifting to the unprofessional behavior of some news personalities and the anonymity of internet commenters versus the accountability of those using real names online.  The segment concluded with a discussion about technology's impact on privacy, mentioning Google's data collection and Ray Kurzweil's predictions about a collective consciousness; numerous off-color jokes and sexual references were made throughout.

The *Fear Factor* discussion continued, with Rogan detailing new stunts involving helicopters and explosions.  This segued into a conversation about reality TV's voyeuristic appeal and Opie's antagonistic relationship with his neighbor.  They brainstormed humorous responses to his neighbor’s annoying question, "Can I help you?", and discussed a friend's dog being poisoned by a neighbor. The hosts lamented the intrusion of commercials on satellite radio. The conversation then shifted to psychic abilities, debunking John Edwards, and exploring phenomena like sensing when being stared at and the theory of morphic resonance. Penn Jillette's previous appearance on the show to expose Edwards was mentioned.  A lengthy discussion on human evolution, technological advancements (referring to Ray Kurzweil and the singularity), and exponential data growth followed, touching upon vestigial organs and the rapid pace of technological change. The hosts expressed skepticism about environmental conservation efforts, mentioning the large garbage patches in the oceans.  The conversation delved into the complexities of human senses, particularly hearing and sight. Opie shared a humorous, crude and suggestive anecdote about his 75-year-old mother's attraction to a 92-year-old man in her assisted living facility. The broadcast concluded with promotional mentions of Sirius XM, Joe Rogan's podcast, upcoming guests (including Anthony Bourdain), and the difficulties of booking certain guests due to corporate limitations. The hosts also briefly discussed SiriusXM's lack of representation at Patrice O'Neal's memorial service, with a recurring "BoboCop" bit interspersed.

A brief, comedic news segment by Fez covered Colin Quinn's tweet criticizing a Saturday Night Live sketch about the Penn State Sandusky scandal.  Anthony Bourdain then joined the studio.  The hosts discussed Bourdain's new show, "The Layover," and "No Reservations."  A substantial portion of the interview covered Bourdain's experiences with food and travel, including instances of food poisoning and parasites, his aversion to tourist traps (Times Square and Olive Garden), and his preference for authentic local eateries. He discussed his views on celebrity chefs, sushi preparation (mentioning Masa and Nozawa), vegan/vegetarian food, and recounted a humorous experience with a dish called "Squeezle."  The conversation also included his steak and burger preferences, his feelings about well-done meat, and experiences with altitude sickness at Machu Picchu.  Bourdain plugged his upcoming "No Reservations" holiday special featuring Christopher Walken, Nora Jones, and the band Fucked Up.

Following Bourdain's departure, Jimmy recounted a bizarre dream involving Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and other individuals, including "E-Rock." The dream involved picture-taking anxieties, a flooded backyard, a seemingly transgender individual, and a bloody CFO.  Opie commented on the recurring picture-taking anxiety and underlying sexual connotations. The segment ended with speculation on the dream's meaning.

The After Open Anthony Live segment started with a discussion of Sam Roberts' habit of maintaining contact with ex-girlfriends and celebrities, mentioning he had contact information for Omar (Jamie Hector).  The conversation shifted back to Anthony Bourdain and *The Layover*, comparing him favorably to other TV chefs and noting Bill Murray's appearance on an episode.  A heated exchange followed regarding Opie's mother's relationship, with Sam recounting his retaliatory comments and the ensuing back-and-forth.  Sam's mother's reaction was also discussed. The discussion then turned to Matt, a hated intern, and the controversy surrounding listener Bobo's ban from an upcoming party.  Matt's actions, including tweeting Bobo to call the show, were heavily criticized; he was repeatedly insulted. Steve Sturniolo from *Raw Dog* joined, further criticizing Matt.  The hosts debated whether Bobo or Matt would make a better intern, devolving into insults directed at Matt.  A potential future show with Sam and Steve was mentioned. The show plugged Steven Singer Jewelers and further discussed Matt's failings, debating Eric's leadership. Bobo called in, and the discussion returned to Matt's actions and Eric's ability to improve Matt's performance before the end of his internship.

A final segment featured a distressed employee, Roland, whose problem involved receiving anal sex ("a dick in the ass"). The hosts and Roland engaged in vulgar and sexually explicit humor, speculating about the circumstances and the perpetrator. The discussion then shifted to the difficulties of being a talent booker, racial stereotypes (referencing Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Asians), and desires for unhealthy food and massage parlor services. The hosts promoted Joe DeRosa’s show and concluded with further sexually explicit jokes and promotion of sponsors, including Trojan condoms.  A future guest was mentioned.  The show then discussed Rogan's experiences on *Fear Factor*, including a graphic anecdote about a contestant drinking animal urine (the airing of which was uncertain). The hosts also discussed a video of Pat Duffy consuming vomit-tainted mashed potatoes, prompting a discussion about extreme stunts and broadcast acceptability.  The conversation then shifted to the dangers of overconsumption of substances like water, salt, caffeine, and aspirin, and then to Stacker 2 and Fen-Fen. Rogan shared his political views, identifying as more Republican but fascinated by Occupy Wall Street.  A discussion about capitalism vs. socialism followed, prompted by a video of Peter Schiff confronting protesters.  This debate covered wealth inequality, job creation, and government intervention. The final segment covered unconventional historical theories, including alien involvement in human creation (gold mining), advanced ancient civilizations (Gobekli Tepe and the Sphinx), and potential catastrophic events (supervolcanoes and tsunamis). Graham Hancock's and John Anthony West's theories were mentioned, concluding with reflections on human fragility and the universe's vastness.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What the planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He did a dang open, and it only did a dang open...  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good fucking morning. 
[00:01:00]  Hi, everybody.  We got Joe Rogan.  He's here already.  Right off the bat.  And I think we already did 20 minutes of radio.  We should have recorded that.  It doesn't matter.  We should get the plug in, because we're going to just start rocking here.  Fear Factor, starting Monday at 8 p.m. on NBC.  Fucking A.  I've been watching the ads they put, the trailers on TV.  Holy fuck.  It looks like they completely threw out any rule book or any restrictions, restraints. 
[00:01:30]  It looks insane now.  I wish I could tell you one episode that we did that may not air, because it's so fucked  up that NBC...  They've watched it for weeks, and they still can't decide whether or not it's going to  air.  They can't figure it out.  Yeah.  I may or may have not watched someone drink animal piss, and that's not even the worst.  Wow.  That's not even the worst part.  It may or may not have.  It may or may not have.  I can't tell you.  They got it.  I can't either deny it or confirm.  Yeah.  But that's not even...  I can't even tell you what I really want to tell you. 
[00:02:00]  During the break, I'll tell you.  Just let it slide.  Just let it go.  No, no, no, not you.  I mean NBC.  Just fucking air it.  It's too fucked up.  Really?  Yeah.  I'll tell you why.  We'll discuss it.  Could it be on a DVD someday?  Yeah.  Well, it's on my phone, so it's eventually going to get somewhere.  Did it happen at Penn State?  No, but it could have.  Is it an eggnog challenge?  No, but it could be.  We should do eggnog challenge for Fear Factor if you're interested. 
[00:02:30]  We can get Pat from Monaki in a second.  Pat from Monaki is still around?  Oh, fuck yeah.  But we need Pat Duffy, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, that lunatic.  Is that guy still around?  You don't hire him anymore, do you?  We just saw him recently at the Hard Rock.  Is he still brushing his teeth with dog shit?  He'll do anything.  What a crazy fuck.  What he did was fucking amazing.  Why don't we show him the video?  Amazing.  We just did a live broadcast for Thanksgiving at the Hard Rock Cafe.  And he did something there?  He'd be good on Fear Factor, wouldn't he?  A guy like that?  Yeah.  You guys were at the Hard Rock in Vegas?  In New York.  Oh, I wish. 
[00:03:00]  And the lawyers have kind of shut down a lot of our shit, unfortunately.  But we're still doing a fine radio show.  But we decided to do a mashed potato eating contest.  Kind of lame.  I'm not going to lie to you.  And then Pat Duffy, who happened to be in the audience.  There he is on stage.  Oh, my God.  Chugs puke.  Yeah.  Well, watch this.  Some guy had puked his own potatoes into the potatoes.  Oh, no.  What you're about to see is he's going to go for this guy's massive, they were huge bowls  of mashed potatoes.  And he puked a lot into his mashed potatoes.  And then Pat Duffy wanted to just come up and say hi to everyone, because it's been 
[00:03:30]  a while.  It looked like gravy.  His stomach bile was brown.  It's a quick video.  And you know what?  He wanted to wish his father a happy 60th birthday.  Joe, you can understand that.  This is so repulsive.  Watch this.  That was my boy.  We're only doing this because you asked about Pat Duffy.  The volume?  Whoa.  All right.  No volume today?  You need a beverage or?  Wait, he's got to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:04:00]  That's the best potato queue.  No, that's the best potato queue.  This kid doesn't give a fuck.  It's stringing.  It's stringing hanging down.  Oh, shit.  No, it doesn't.  No.  No.  No, he just took his scoop up.  God, fucking damn it.  Joe looked away.  Joe looked away.  That is so repulsive.  Whoa.  Logan, who has seen everything, has looked away.  This is hard to watch.  This is really hard to watch. 
[00:04:30]  That kid takes it to another level.  Yeah, yeah, he does.  He's still thirsty, though.  You need to.  Oh, he goes back.  Oh, yeah, he has to go back for a second scoop.  Oh, no, no, no.  Can you watch that again?  Second scoop.  I can't watch it.  It's so bad.  That's truly terrible.  And he's not done there, Joe.  The video's almost over.  He goes in for a third scoop, and then you get to see what the mashed potatoes really look  like.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  God damn it. 
[00:05:00]  He keeps going.  Yeah, he does.  He does.  What is wrong with this fucking guy?  He's just.  Oh.  Oh.  You should get him for Fear Factor.  Not that.  No, I mean, he's a ringer.  Yeah, yeah, he's a ringer.  No ringers, definitely.  Yeah.  You can't have ringers.  Definitely.  Well, I would like to see, though.  There were some things that we did that I know even he would gag.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a time when we made them drink blended maggots, and it wasn't just a little bit. 
[00:05:30]  It was like a fucking big gulp full of blended maggots.  It was so rough.  It was so horrible watching people do it.  Did you take a sip just to see what it.  No.  Not even to.  No.  Not interested.  You're not that guy.  I don't need to know that it sucks.  You don't need to know.  I know it sucks.  It's a host.  Yeah.  The fucking host.  I thought it was the host.  He doesn't do that shit.  It's a fucking disaster.  I thought it was the host.  You might want to like part day.  But you need to know there's guys like Pat Duffy out there.  We all grew up with that one kid that just will take it to the next level.  Do anything.  Right. 
[00:06:00]  We've been doing this a long time.  He's the king.  Oh, he's the monster.  Pat Duffy is the fucking king.  There's no one that comes close to the shit he's done.  Baby bird.  Imagine how many fucking people would willingly do that.  Yeah.  I'll never forget that.  That was the greatest moment of any radio show I've ever been a part of.  Without a doubt.  I don't think I.  When that kid leaned over that garbage pail.  Yeah.  And had fucking Pat from Wunaki unload in his mouth.  A cartoonish amount of puke.  Yes.  It was cartoonish.  Remember?  It really was. 
[00:06:30]  It was a goddamn broken fire hydrant.  It was just unbelievable.  It was so repulsive.  And that was a tradition.  And unfortunately, that was shut down.  They shut that down?  Yeah.  The lawyers shut that down?  They shut that down.  Because somebody died in California doing a water drinking contest.  And then no one in the fucking country can ever do it again.  No kind of like eating, drinking, anything like that.  Socking, fucking.  Right.  Isn't it amazing that you can die from water?  Yeah, that is fucked up.  Who knew that?  Who knew that?  It's so, you know, needed.  If you hold that shit in.  Apparently, it's happened with like fraternity pledges. 
[00:07:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People don't realize.  What happens?  You drink too much water.  What's the biological?  Well, I think you're, it gets super saturated in your system and then it can just come out  into your brain.  It just, you get like some kind of fucking, like it could absorb into your system, but  then it just like comes out of your bloodstream.  Isn't that fucking nuts?  When you think about like, you know, when you talk about drugs, they always talk about  the LD50 rate with this lethal dose for 50% of the population. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  What you don't realize is most of the shit that you take, like salt, eat, go eat a pound  of salt.  You're fucking dead.  Dead.  You're dead.  Meanwhile, you sprinkle it on your fries, sprinkle it on your burgers.  It's poison.  You eat a pound of that shit.  You're dead as fuck.  You eat a little bit, you're fine.  How close do you think you've come to eating a pound?  In your whole life?  Well, I don't know.  Just in a weekend or something when you just went crazy with salt.  Well, you don't have to do it all in one sitting.  You know, it's not a weekend. 
[00:08:00]  It's like within an hour.  You know, you have to somehow or another eat a pound of salt.  There's some salty shit out there, though, man.  You're eating poison all day, man.  Like fucking, you know, bananas got potassium in it.  If you eat fucking potassium, you're going to be dead.  Eat too much of it.  Have too many aspirin.  You'll fucking die.  Yeah.  The water thing makes you a water head is what Kevin from Connecticut is saying.  Somewhere around 10,000 people die from, I believe it's aspirin and caffeine, to aspirin  and caffeine to overdose in this country alone.  It's like 10,000 people.  Caffeine?  I don't know how they can do it.  Yeah, now you're freaking out. 
[00:08:30]  Tell us people.  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  Oh, yeah.  You could die.  You ever heard of people dying from those rip fuels?  Do you remember those?  Oh, yeah.  Well, they don't have the same ingredients anymore.  I think they took out the really hard shit.  I forget what the fuck it was called.  I don't remember either.  Oh, remember that shit?  Yeah, yeah.  They took out the diet pills.  People would love to...  Girls were taking in diet pills.  Ephedrine?  How much coffee am I allowed to have?  Yes, ephedrine.  How much coffee am I allowed to have?  It's a good question.  I was just saying...  Now you're freaking me out with the OG on the caffeine.  I had some...  I mean, I have a cup here this morning, which I will drink very lightly, but I took like 
[00:09:00]  two weeks off of coffee.  Yeah.  It was the first time in my whole life I've ever done that.  Headaches?  No.  Flow symptoms, like they say?  I did when I was writing my book, and when I was writing the book, I was drinking like five,  six cups a day, and then I took a couple days off and I had headaches.  But this time I didn't have any headaches, but when I took like four days off, I had  a cup after that, and then I was like, whoa, like it really hits you.  And then I'm like, man, I'm just used to this shit.  Like, this can't be normal to be used to this heavy-duty stimulant. 
[00:09:30]  So then I just took a bunch of time off, and what I was amazed with was how much energy  I had throughout the day.  Like, I didn't need a nap at the end of the day.  It was like I was even.  And I was like, oh, but I still wanted the coffee.  You still want that charge.  You're still junky.  They say that, though.  You get your energy back if you get off the coffee.  Yeah.  So you're not crashing.  Right.  Exactly.  I don't deal with that.  So what I did is I switched to tea.  I started drinking like herbal teas.  So it's just I just wanted a warm liquid, you know?  Does it work?  I mean, it's okay.  As far as the craving goes?  Yeah, sort of.  All right.  You know? 
[00:10:00]  And then you get decaf.  Stick to water all day.  But decaf still fucks you.  Why?  Yeah, decaf sucks.  Decaf still has caffeine.  Does it really?  Yeah.  It sucks.  I drink that at night.  I drink it at night.  I didn't know how to have caffeine.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you probably drink so much coffee that it's just like, you could probably drink a cup of coffee  and then do a nap.  Regular coffee I can't.  I'm a very bad sleeper.  Really?  It keeps me up, yeah.  You drink a lot of coffee during the day, right?  Yeah, I do.  Two or three cups.  Now it's not as bad as you can.  Just in the morning for me.  When you're doing radio or when I'm doing my podcast, I feel like I need a little something  to just get me fucking really fired up and get going.  You just need something to just sip the whole time. 
[00:10:30]  And it fucking marries.  You need a little bit of a stimulant.  You're talking and thinking and, you know.  You do a little, you know.  A little of that helps, too.  A little of that.  I took a little of that before I got here.  I'll tell you that.  I did the opposite.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I sit in my basement and drink.  What's that?  Drink?  I do the opposite.  I sit in my basement and start the webcast and I'll just start drinking and by the end of  it, I'm just like, yeah, I'm sick of the fucking phone calls yet.  Just no thought process.  Just completely slosh.  And you sit there where you check and you guys get hammered together. 
[00:11:00]  It's hilarious.  You start arguing.  You start arguing.  It's like watching the Days of Wine and Roses.  That shit was in Stacker 2.  Oh, right.  That's Fedra, man.  That's Fedra, right?  And we were big fucking advertisers for Stacker 2.  Oh, really?  And they had to change the ingredients in there.  With the Ebedra, you mean?  Yes.  I don't know what the ingredient was.  Maybe it was.  You remember when people were on that Fen-Fen shit?  Yeah, and it was fucking their hearts up.  It was to lose weight, right?  I know a girl who lost like 40 pounds.  She got hot.  She was like a little chubster. 
[00:11:30]  And then all of a sudden she got on the Fen-Fen and everybody's like, what the fuck?  Like, it was quick, man.  It was like a couple of months.  That can't be good for you.  Yeah, all the terrible for you.  It can't be good for you.  She got off that shit and right back up.  Right back up.  I pulled right up.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I mean, she was just fucking hitting it at the red line all day.  It's like flat, fat flowers for Algernon.  You know how when you're on the highway and you're in your Shelby and you hit that fucking  red line before you change gears?  Yeah.  That bitch was living there.  That's what she was living.  Just...  She was just living there all day. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, man, that's a tough place to be.  Drinking Diet Coke and taking Fen-Fen.  Just fuck the heart.  Yeah.  Fuck the heart.  I want some good dick.  I want some quality dick.  For once in my life, I don't want some fucking sacrifice dick.  Some chubby chaser.  Yeah.  Why the fuck don't you live on the East Coast, man?  I wish I did.  We don't get to see you enough, Joe.  I listen.  I love you guys.  I listen all the time.  Constantly.  All day.  Whenever I'm in my car, unless I'm listening to the news, this is what I listen to. 
[00:12:30]  And I check out the podcast.  Or unless I want to get angry.  I listen to, like, you know, right-wing talk radio and listen to fucking idiots.  Who do you listen to?  Oh, whoever's on.  There's a Patriot station on XM Sirius.  Yeah.  Patriot radio.  It's not fucking great.  No, I mean, you need to know that there's actually people like that out there.  People are saying to me, they're like, why don't you fucking call Rogan out and being  such a lib?  I'm not.  I mean, he's not fucking, if you know Joe, he's not a lefty.  He's not fucking a righty.  You're in the middle, right? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I'm more of a Republican than I am a liberal.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  But it's more of a...  With gun laws and, you know, and a lot of different things.  I'm much more of a Republican.  Like, people think I'm completely right-wing.  That's not the truth, man.  I fucking...  I love abortions.  Jesus.  Go for it, ladies.  You like the Occupy Wall Street thing, though, right?  I'm fascinated by the rebellion.  I'm not...  I don't think it's really focused.  We will crush your rebellion.  Most of the people that are involved in this, I think, are just there for the party. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  You know?  And they're happy.  They're angry.  Like, did you see there's a great video of Peter Schiff?  You know who he is?  That fucking Wall Street genius.  And he's down there talking to these guys.  And he's got a big sign that says, I am the 1%.  Right.  And he's in a fucking, you know, $15,000 suit.  Wow.  And he's like, come on, ask me questions.  And they come over, and he just tortures these poor fucks.  Because they really have no business.  There he is.  They have no business talking to this fucking super genius financial wizard. 
[00:14:00]  And these idiots are like, why do you need to make $100 million?  Couldn't you just live on $40 million?  He's like, I employ 120 people.  How many people do you employ?  And they're like...  And they're like, it's because of us that you...  You should really listen to it, because it's really kind of hilarious.  He's playing right now.  Maybe see if we can find some common ground.  It's not capitalism.  Look at a big sign.  I'm the 1%.  Let's talk.  Corporatism.  Nice suit.  Crony capitalism.  It's fascism.  That is the problem. 
[00:14:30]  Capitalism is the solution if we can only fully embrace it.  Anyway, we've got a few people around here.  Calling out all these assholes in the banks for years.  Address any of their grievances.  Fucking genius.  Imagine.  Compassionate capitalism.  Is there such a thing?  Could there be such a thing?  Well, it's the most compassionate system I know.  By definition.  If you make $100 million...  This is my favorite.  Imagine how many jobs could be created if you just made $50 million. 
[00:15:00]  But what you're forgetting is, if I make $100 million,  I had to create a lot of jobs to make that money.  That's the point.  When the capitalist is making money...  No, see, there's a thing called greed.  And the problem with greed...  But we're all greedy.  Everybody...  No, no, we're not.  You cannot say that we're all greedy.  Yeah, the ambitious people are greedy.  You are greedy.  You want things for yourself?  You don't want better things for yourself?  We are doing that.  That's the problem.  We, or some of us, are simple people.  We just want a place to live. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, this is...  We just want a place to live.  We just want some food in our refrigerator.  And capitalism...  We just want to take care of our kids.  Capitalism is the best way to get those things.  I mean, you're standing here.  You're not naked.  You have clothes on.  The people that made those clothes did it to make a profit.  And to make a profit, they had to make clothes that you can afford.  Do you think that socialism is wrong?  It is wrong.  It's absolutely wrong.  First, I employ 150 people.  I employ 150 people.  I've created those jobs.  How many jobs did you create?  How many people did you employ?  How much money have I given you?  You haven't given me anything. 
[00:16:00]  But I'm just wondering, I've created 150 jobs.  I'm writing paychecks every week.  I haven't given you anything.  What are you...  Everybody in this park has contributed to your fat-ass bank account.  How do you figure?  And one way, shape, form...  How do you figure that?  You know something?  You need to open up your mind.  Where the people in this park work in 20-hour days?  When I started my company in my one-bedroom apartment, were they there?  No, they weren't.  I'm quite sure they have been. 
[00:16:30]  Where do you stand concerning our plight?  This guy's great.  I feel for the plight.  Where do you stand concerning our plight?  What does it mean?  What does that even mean?  I didn't want the government to bail them out.  That's not capitalism.  Capitalism would have let the banks fail.  A lot of people on Wall Street would have lost their jobs if we had capitalism.  Do you see this as a left-wing movement, or do you see this more as a populist, apolitical movement?  Well, I think that people, especially young people, have a right to be pissed off.  One of the problems people want is the forgiveness of the student loans.  Why are there all these student loans? 
[00:17:00]  It's because the government guaranteed them.  If the government minded its own business, then nobody could get a student loan.  Well, there's never been a monopoly without government involvement.  But my point is, if it wasn't for the government, college would be cheap.  The tuitions would be low.  It's only because the government subsidizes it and guarantees the loans.  But who gets the shaft here?  It's the kids.  The colleges get all the money, and they stick the kids with the bill.  They graduate with these worthless degrees, with $100,000 or more in debt, and they can't get a job.  And if they get a job, they're paying massive taxes.  They're paying Social Security taxes to support a generation. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, don't fuck with a financial genius when you're in his hip clothes.  It's so fucking good.  It takes balls to go down there.  I've been down there a bunch of times.  What's this smell like?  Pretty bad.  Pretty goddamn bad, Mikey.  Like the old school Grateful Dead shows?  Really?  As opposed to good.  But you nailed it.  I mean, the fringe people are all freaks.  You want to peel them away and see what this really is about.  That first guy was the classic attitude.  Right.  This attitude that, you know, why should you have this when all I want is a job and food on my table? 
[00:18:00]  It doesn't work that way, man.  It doesn't work that way.  You've got to go get that job.  Get it.  Yeah, the system is absolutely fucked.  But knowing that, go forward.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the game.  Here's how the game works.  Right.  It's fucked up.  It's rigged.  There's a lot of holes in it.  But you can get a pot of gold at the end.  You've just got to figure a way through the fucking funky maze.  When you're playing Monopoly, no one gives you the hotels.  Yeah.  Well, absolutely, though, he's right, though.  I mean, and it would have been crazy if all the banks failed. 
[00:18:30]  It would really have been nuts.  It would have been madness.  But really, that's what is supposed to happen.  Yeah.  I mean, it really is supposed to happen that way.  I don't understand finances enough to comment on all that shit.  But what I do know is that the guy like that first guy, that's a big part of this movement,  this idealistic, hippie, socialist sort of attitude that it's just fucking ridiculous.  All we want is food on our table.  And, man, who's going to provide that?  And, by the way, no, they don't. 
[00:19:00]  Because once you have the food on your table and the shelter and the clothes, you'll look  at somebody else with a nice car and go, hey, I want a nice car.  And I want this.  And I want to take vacations.  How come he gets to go on a boat and do this?  Well, that's human nature, of course.  Yeah, of course it is.  And it doesn't work in socialism.  Right.  It doesn't work.  In capitalism, it works.  But it's not a guarantee.  I don't know how these people are confusing your constitutional rights with the opportunity  to make something of yourself in this country. 
[00:19:30]  It's not a guaranteed right.  What would happen if the banks did fail, though?  I don't know the answer to that.  It would be a huge change.  Yeah.  Like, that would make big, big change.  I don't know in what direction.  Well, the thing is, you would lose your fucking money.  That's what's really scary.  Hell, I want FDIC.  Yeah.  We're not a bank, Jerry.  I'm here getting gold.  That's all I have.  I have all my money in gold.  I have a buddy of mine who bought his son a fucking gold brick for his second birthday.  Got to get a gold brick.  This is the start of his collection.  Like, why don't you get him gasoline and bullets? 
[00:20:00]  Because that's what he's going to need.  A gold figure prop.  Who are you going to sell that to?  If it ever gets to the point where you need gold, that gold's going to be fucking worthless.  Yeah, worthless.  Because someone will take it.  Someone with a gun.  It just doesn't mean anything.  How the fuck did everybody agree on gold?  Right.  Out of all the weird shit to agree on, worldwide, one fucking rare mineral just takes precedent.  And for quite a while.  I know the off-shelf answer.  It's not even like they decided recently. 
[00:20:30]  Like, gold has been fucking gold.  10,000 years.  For years.  Like, people just decided.  And we still look at it like, yeah, that's the shit.  Well, do you know the craziest explanation for that?  It's by Zechariah Sitchin, who was a biblical scholar and a linguist who studied the Sumerian  text.  And the Sumerian text is one of the oldest written languages.  It's in cuneiform.  It's from Mesopotamia, Babylon, where Iraq is.  The cradle of civilization.  Where it all began.  We think that's actually moving further back now, but, you know, because, like, they just  found a fishing line and hooks and tuna bones from 40,000 years ago, so they know 
[00:21:00]  that people were going hundreds of kilometers out into the ocean and catching fucking tuna  40,000 years ago.  They were probably some badass-looking tuna.  Could you imagine?  Yeah.  Could you imagine?  What kind of a line did they have?  Where did they find that?  They just recently have discovered this.  It was probably tuna that would walk up on the fucking shore and punch people in the  face.  You'd be raping their wife when they came home.  Come home.  Your baby's getting eaten by a tuna.  Where do you think that smell came from?  There's a tuna shitting in the yard.  Can you go kill it? 
[00:21:30]  So this guy, Zachariah Sitchin, wrote these books about the Sumerian text, and his deciphering  of the Sumerian text is, like, very, very controversial, and a lot of people say he's crazy, but what  he says is that the entire human race was created by aliens, and that what happened was there's  a planet that's in an elliptical orbit that comes between Mars and Jupiter every 3,600  years.  And these people, human beings, were created because they took their DNA and merged it with 
[00:22:00]  a monkey DNA and created this advanced slave to mine for gold.  Because they use gold to, they suspend gold in their atmosphere to protect their atmosphere  because they've lost their atmosphere, just like our atmosphere is slowly eroding because  of, you know, modern machines and industrial society, well, and pollution.  Their atmosphere is already eroded, so they suspend gold particles in their atmosphere.  And that's a, it sounds completely retarded, but if you stop and think about, like, why 
[00:22:30]  the fuck do we like gold?  Like, why has it been that way for so long?  Well, if we were, like, genetically engineered to mine for this shit by aliens, sounds stupid.  But then you realize that this guy wrote this book in, like, the 1970s, and they didn't  figure out, there's a symposium on climate change in, like, the 2000s, where they were  battering around ideas for how to combat, you know, the erosion of the atmosphere.  And one of them was suspension of reflective particles in the atmosphere. 
[00:23:00]  Jesus.  And this was, like, no one knew this in the 1970s.  We didn't even have that issue in the 1970s.  Right.  But this fucking guy wrote this book about this.  Well, let me ask you, wouldn't a guy, wouldn't a guy, wouldn't a civilization that had the  ability to genetically create something that could think in mind have the ability to mock  a particle?  Yeah.  Or to stimulate a particle?  Well, we can do that, you know.  You know, alchemy really exists.  You can turn lead into gold.  The problem is, it requires fucking nuclear engines.  I mean, it requires nuclear reactors-type power, and you can only get a tiny amount of it 
[00:23:30]  from a large amount of gold, or from a large amount of lead.  It's like, it's not efficient at all, but it is physically possible.  You can develop small particles of gold from lead.  I just imagine an alchemist with, like, his mortar and pestle sitting there with a wizard  hat on it.  Imagine a bunch of Jay-Z records in the sky.  How the hell do you talk?  I don't know.  We don't know shit, is what it comes down to.  Well, we don't know shit about human civilization, that's for sure.  We don't know shit about how long people have been around.  Right.  You know, there's a new thing that they found recently called Gobekli Tepe. 
[00:24:00]  It's in Turkey, and it's at least 12,000 years old, which is when people were supposed to  be wearing animal skins.  We're supposed to be hunter-gatherers and nomadic people.  And they found this huge stone structure with fucking, you know, 19-foot-high stone columns  that are perfectly cut and animals that are carved into them that don't even exist in that  country.  You know, they have no idea how these fucking people built this, who built this, why they 
[00:24:30]  built it, and on top of that, it was intentionally covered up.  So someone, 12,000 plus years ago, covered this whole fucking thing up.  They built this massive stone complex of huge circles, and they don't know what the fuck  it is, why it was there.  Some guy just found it.  He was a goat herder.  Yeah, 19, I believe it was the 1990s that the guy discovered it.  He was just herding goats.  I wonder why, though, it's always very mysterious and stuff, but it's made of stone all the time.  I would like to see something made out of some kind of really fucked up material, and that 
[00:25:00]  would be, like, proof positive.  Well, the stone is the only thing that exists.  But it always leaves that element of, you know, you're like, all right, people could have  done that here.  Yes.  You know, but if you see something, like, from Star Trek, with a big monolithic fucking  made out of some type of metal with symbols on it, you'd be like, all right, that's fucked  or false teeth in a dinosaur mouth, just something.  Well, have you seen those things they find in, like, Egyptian pyramids, where they find, 
[00:25:30]  like, little model airplanes?  Have you ever seen those?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you think, it could be a bird.  Yeah, but it has a rudder.  No bird has a rudder.  It has an upright rudder that doesn't exist in the animal kingdom.  I've seen that.  That is pretty weird.  It's fucking amazing.  Or maybe they just understood flight to a certain degree, or understood what the aerodynamics  would be.  Right.  You know, understanding flight is nothing compared to understanding how to build a fucking  gigantic, perfect complex of 2,300,000 stones, you know, all cut, literally, I mean, the 
[00:26:00]  tolerance has to be, like, micro millimeters in order to get it perfectly, to meet at the  top.  That is crazy.  Well, that's insane.  You ever see some failed pyramids that just, they didn't quite, they started fucked up at  the bottom, and they get up top, and it's like, ah, we're flat.  It's like a Frankenstein pyramid.  Well, you know, the conventional wisdom is that those were the first pyramids.  But there's a lot of people that believe that that's not the case, that in fact, what  happened was, there was great civilizations from 30,000, 40,000 years ago, and then massive 
[00:26:30]  ecological disasters, whether it's, you know, a meteor impact or something happened, killed  a huge percent of the population.  And then people lost all that information and tried to rebuild these pyramids.  And that's what the shitty ones are.  You stick.  Yeah, the shitty ones, they believe, are actually the newer ones.  Right.  There was a big rat in front of the new pyramids.  Non-union.  Non-union.  A big rat.  Instead of a sphinx.  Fucking scab.  It's a fucking rat.  They can't even, you know, they can't even wrap their head around how those people built 
[00:27:00]  that shit, 2,500 B.C., you know.  Have they reenacted it, too?  I've seen, like, shows where they kind of think they can figure it out.  It's a guesswork.  One professor will say this.  Another scholar will say that's not the way.  There's some scholars that say it wasn't, that they were actually made out of concrete  and that they made a concrete, a form of, you know, that these were actually cast.  Right.  You know, and there's a lot of evidence to support that, too.  But it's amazing that we can't.  Without Italians there, come on. 
[00:27:30]  It's amazing we can't figure out how it was built, still.  With all the shit we're doing.  Well, there's a massive amount of evidence that people have been around a lot longer than we  think they are.  Oh, I believe that.  But this tuna thing, this, you know, finding these 42,000-year-old fucking tuna bones and  hooks and line and shit, like, what?  Dude, match the hatch, dude.  You take the man, Bobby.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, because I think as they find more stuff, you realize that, yeah, people have  been thinking and making tools a lot earlier than we thought. 
[00:28:00]  Well, I had this guy on my podcast, his name is Graham Hancock, and he's written a bunch  of books about this stuff.  He spent his whole life studying it.  He's got a book called Fingerprints of the Gods, and it's his assertion that somewhere  around 10,500 BC, there was something, something happened, some massive ecological disaster,  some massive, you know, whether it was a flood or, there's a bunch of different theories  to what it was, what it was, melting glaciers, there's a, and it coincides with the end of  the Ice Age as well.  Mm-hmm.  You know, the end of the Ice Age happened really abruptly, and it killed a bunch of species 
[00:28:30]  almost instantly, like, woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers.  They find them dead, like, thousands of them all in a field, and they have no idea what  killed them, no idea how quickly they died, you know, because, like, a fucking, if a bear  dies in the woods, that bear is, there's nothing left in a couple of weeks.  All the bones get chewed up, the flesh gets eaten by other bears, they cannibalize it,  and that's what happens with almost every animal.  So when you get a place where there's thousands of bodies, something fucking happened, and they 
[00:29:00]  don't know what that something was, but it coincides with the melting of the glaciers  that covered North America.  You know, North America, 10,000 years ago, was covered in over a mile-high fucking sheet  of ice.  Most of North America was under ice, and what people don't know is, when that ice is moving,  it's like a fucking eraser.  It's grinding everything.  It's moving a couple feet a year, and it's a mile high, and it's crushing everything in  its path.  So any buildings, any construction, any computer you leave behind, that shit is gone, man. 
[00:29:30]  There will be no evidence other than the stone.  That is amazing.  Pretty fucking crazy.  I didn't realize it was only 10,000 years ago.  Yeah, 10,000 years ago, there were saber-toothed tigers in North America.  And it took so long to build up the ice to that point.  And then, relatively short period of time to pull back again.  And the stuff it left, though, when you look, like, in Central Park, all those giant boulders, 
[00:30:00]  that's directly because of the ice age.  The Great Lakes.  Dragging.  Yeah, the Great Lakes.  You ever fly over the Great Lakes?  I've only flown over once.  Recently, we did a UFC in Milwaukee, and we flew over Lake Michigan.  I was like, holy fuck, that's an ocean.  Yeah.  It's a goddamn ocean of water.  We used to take boats across there when I lived in western New York.  It's an ocean.  Joe Rogan is right.  And that used to be a giant fucking sheet of ice.  And that's like a little puddle that's left.  Right.  Wow.  Long Island itself, you know, if you look at the geography of Long Island, the North Shore 
[00:30:30]  being very rocky, very deep water, and the South Shore being very sandy and shallow into  the ocean.  It was directly because of the receding ice just pulling everything back.  It is.  It's just, it's fucking amazing.  We can't even wrap our heads around that.  No, and the time frame is just insane.  It's like, oh, what do we spend?  75, maybe hopefully 80, 85 years on this planet?  Yeah.  It's fucking nothing.  You're not seeing shit.  Well, have you heard the black hole they just recently discovered that's 21 billion times 
[00:31:00]  the mass of our sun and 10 times larger than our solar system?  Could you give me an example I can understand?  Wrap your head around that.  A black hole 10 times larger than our fucking solar system.  Yeah, that's crazy.  And that's nothing.  And that's not, if that disappears, the universe won't even notice it.  We didn't even find it until recently.  Like, oh, look at that.  Look at that little silly thing sitting there, eating up fucking galaxies, sucking galaxies 
[00:31:30]  down its maw.  Does this shit freak you out, Joe?  Yeah, sure.  Definitely.  Because you really study this shit.  You know it.  Oh, yeah.  I got too much free time.  When I have too much free time, that's when I start really going into this stuff.  But it doesn't seem like this knowledge and pot would go together.  Really?  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's perfectly in sync.  I think it would just freak you out.  That paranoia thing might get you.  I think it would just freak you out.  If you start thinking too much about something.  Right.  I think paranoia is a good thing.  Enormity of things.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  I think a lot of people walk through life with blinders on.  Of course.  And I think one of the things that marijuana does is it makes you realize, like, oh, my 
[00:32:00]  God, I'm like a fleshy little water balloon of fucking blood and tissue.  An amazing goop could work like a machine.  Like, we're just goop.  Yeah.  Yeah, we work like a machine.  We're so fucking fleshy.  It's fucking amazing.  I've got this back injury that I've been dealing with.  I pulled a muscle in my back a few weeks ago doing jujitsu, and I can't train.  And I go back, and I'll work out a little bit, and then I'll pull it again.  And I'm trying to figure it out.  It's just so you realize how goddamn feeble you are. 
[00:32:30]  Even MMA fighters.  George St. Pierre just blew out his ACL.  Done.  Done for like a year.  Is he really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They canceled the Diaz fight for Super Bowl weekend, and now Condit is going to fight  Nick Diaz for an interim title.  Yeah, we're a tissue.  What was he doing when he did it?  Wrestling.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I've had both of mine done.  It's common.  Your knees just are stupid design.  You could drop a fucking ant from the top of a building, which would be equivalent to,  you know, skydiving from the atmosphere.  Yeah.  And they'll just, boom, hit the ground and walk away. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  It's like, why do we have to be so fragile?  What the fuck do we have to be so fragile?  What the fuck do we have to be so fragile?  Can you imagine that?  I want an exoskeleton.  That would be cool.  Someone was describing LSD to me.  Someone was describing LSD to me that LSD, if you, on a molecular level, it's so potent  that it's like an ant that destroys the Statue of Liberty in 30 minutes.  That's how potent acid is on molecular level.  You know, I don't know if this is true.  I don't know what the real numbers are. 
[00:33:30]  But someone told me that you could take like a fucking milk gallon full of acid and throw  it into a reservoir and everyone in whatever fucking town you live in, everyone in whatever  city, New York City, whatever, just be fucked.  Just fuck a milk gallon full of acid.  That's it.  Just chuck it in.  I had a friend of mine who accidentally poured acid.  You know Yoshi.  Yeah, yeah.  We all know Yoshi.  Yoshi accidentally poured acid in his eyes.  He didn't know.  A friend had an eyedropper.  And it was acid in the eyedropper.  And he was in the guy's bathroom and he was searching around for shit. 
[00:34:00]  And he, you know, opens up this thing.  He goes, oh, he's got a little eyedropper.  I got a red eye.  I'm going to put it in there.  And he drops.  He goes, I go, how much did you put in there?  He goes, I don't know, seven, eight, nine drops.  Jesus Christ.  What happened to him?  Fuck, just fuck, just fucking gone for who knows how long.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Insane.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, Joe.  Russell, Peter, say hi.  Do you want some anal porn?  He works in the porn business.  We know.  We know.  We've gotten some gifts. 
[00:34:30]  We know Yoshi.  He's always giving you those gaping videos.  Yeah.  And then you accidentally get a few Joey Silveras in there.  And you're like, I'll look at these later.  How did we go from Yelji?  We went from Egypt to, he's the link.  It's just, just all that stuff.  And a lot of people call it pot talk and shit like that, you know, but.  It's not.  It's thinking.  It's thinking.  Yeah.  It's, you know, wondering, you know, where you came from, what it's all about.  I was thinking about how vulnerable we are as a being, but then how amazing we can be 
[00:35:00]  at times just in something so silly as.  You ever, you ever get very proud of yourself when you drop something and move your foot  out of the way at the last split second as to not crush your foot with something and  go, I didn't even have to go like, all right, something's falling.  I better move my foot out of the way.  I'll move it to the right.  I'll pivot it on my heel.  And it's just automatic.  You don't think about it.  And it's like, what does that take to do that?  It's just an amazing thing. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  It has to fire up without consciousness.  Yeah.  It has to be an instinct.  In the time it takes for something to fall three feet, you know, that's not a lot of  time.  I want to go back to that stone thing.  Where was that in Turkey, you said?  Gobekli Tepe.  It's in, yeah, it's in Turkey.  Because Ant goes, if we found some kind of metals or something else, then he'd be impressed.  Well, this isn't the aliens.  This is people that made it.  But I'm just saying, the fact is, a lot of that shit would not last 10,000 years.  There's only stone, only stone would last that long.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's one of the arguments about the ancient civilizations. 
[00:36:00]  You know, this guy named John Anthony West, he's an Egyptologist, and he's written a bunch  of stuff.  And he's got a great DVD series called Magical Egypt, where he goes really into depth about  how amazing the Egyptian culture were.  The Egyptians were fucking aliens, man.  I mean, they weren't really aliens, they were people, but I'm saying, you compare them to  all the other civilizations, all the other cultures on Earth, these motherfuckers were  on not just another level, they were on several different levels above every other fucking 
[00:36:30]  scratching, clawing human with a sharp rock at the end of their pointed stick.  And what's the theory there?  Why were they like that?  Well, the theory is that they existed a lot longer than we think they did.  And he points to some solid geological evidence.  There's a guy named Robert Schock, who's a professor at a Boston University, he's a geologist,  and he did some work on the Sphinx.  And they're saying that the enclosure of the Sphinx has water erosion on it, like deep 
[00:37:00]  fissures that could only be attributed to thousands of years of rainfall.  And the problem with that is that the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was  like somewhere around 9,000 BC.  And so it had to exist thousands of years before that.  So this stuff was cut, and then thousands of years of rain, and then somewhere along the line,  if you look at the Sphinx, it's got a very different head than the rest of the body.  The head is too small. 
[00:37:30]  So they think some pharaoh came along many, many, many, many, many thousands of years after  it was initially built and then put his face on it.  Like, I don't like that, whatever it was up there.  Yeah.  Ah, get that off of there.  Put my face on that motherfucker.  But if you take that away, and if this guy's right, and geological evidence is about as  fucking hard as you can get, you know, the evidence that they have, archaeological evidence,  a lot of it, you know, they're piecing things together.  There's a lot of theories.  There's a lot of question marks.  You know, when they're doing carbon dating on stuff, what they're doing carbon dating on  is, you know, it's basically stuff that's left behind, like whether it's food or, 
[00:38:00]  or, you know, something that's burnt or, you know, they can't carbon date stone.  So if they find something that's, you know, carbon dated, that's near the stone, you know,  and it's like 10,000 BC, that doesn't mean that the stone was created in 10,000 BC or  cut in 10,000 BC.  It's really just guesswork.  Right.  But the geological evidence of water erosion is pretty fucking solid.  They've taken pictures of the Sphinx and put masking tape over the head and masking tape  over the feet and brought it to all these different geologists and said, is this water 
[00:38:30]  erosion or is this sand and wind?  A hundred percent of them say it's sand.  It's not sand and wind.  A hundred percent of them say they show this Sphinx enclosure and they say, well, this is  water erosion.  This is deep fissures.  It's curved and smooth.  It looks like water ran through it, like thousands of years of water cutting stone.  So just that alone.  But when you bring this up to the Egyptologists, they get all pissy.  They're like, what evidence of this culture from 10,500 BC?  Well, there is no evidence.  That's the thing.  There would be nothing left.  Yeah.  There wouldn't really be anything. 
[00:39:00]  We're going back so far that stone is the only shit that would exist.  Is it possible that the stone would, they brought the stones from other places?  Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything because it's cut.  See, it's an enclosure.  And what is it?  They built the Sphinx, say like if it's a giant quarry.  They cut the quarry.  You know how they cut like walls out of the quarry?  Well, those walls are where the deep fissure marks are.  It's the area where the Sphinx was built.  They know that they cut these massive stones and they moved them from that area and it constructed  to the temple of the Sphinx. 
[00:39:30]  Once you make the cut, the clock starts ticking out.  Oh, okay.  So once they made that cut somewhere around 10,000 plus BC, which is fucking way earlier  than we think people did that.  We think people were building the Sphinx in 2,500 BC.  And he also has a lot of other evidence too, this John Anthony West guy, where there's massively  different construction methods from the older civilizations to the newer ones.  And he can show them.  And the older ones, a lot of it is still underground.  They've dug up a bunch of them.  And the ones they've dug up, there's like temples on top of them. 
[00:40:00]  So you're dealing with a civilization, a culture that existed thousands and thousands and thousands  of years, potentially before we thought.  And it pushes back the inventions of things way earlier.  The inventions of amazing things, like mathematics and the ability to construct these perfect  geometric patterns.  Being able to design some of these structures.  I think when you get these pockets of communities, that's when shit started rolling. 
[00:40:30]  When you just get a family or a clan or a fucking group of hunters, perhaps, I think until  you start really getting a community with a common language, some type of way to communicate  with each other, then you're going to start rolling out invention and structures and make  a kind of a community.  And they have to have weapons.  Because they have to fight off those other fucks.  Those other fuckers that are still...  Well, that's when Egypt fell apart. 
[00:41:00]  Egypt fell apart when the Nubians conquered them.  The Nubians, though, the blacker Africans, they're Sephardics.  The original Egyptians, the southern fellows, the southern fellows came up and caused a  ruckus.  And by the way, that's also the face of the Sphinx.  The face of the Sphinx is a Nubian pharaoh.  It's not one of the Sephardic pharaohs.  After the...  We were talking about that.  My face of death.  My face, bitch.  See, I told you.  Bitch.  That's why they shaved the nose off. 
[00:41:30]  Shot it off.  Shot off.  Shot off the nose.  Yeah, they say Napoleon did that.  Nobody knows, though.  That could easily just fell off.  No one really knows.  How humiliating if the nose just fell off.  Shoddy workmanship.  Well, you know, they built it over an old construction of a lion's head.  Yeah.  And the idea is that at 10,500 BC, that Sphinx actually points to the constellation Leo.  So the thing called the procession of the equinoxes is one of the reasons why they can calculate  all these things as far as dates and times and astrological things because the Earth doesn't 
[00:42:00]  spin evenly.  It doesn't spin perfectly.  It wobbles.  And when it wobbles, that wobbling is a 26,000-year cycle of coming back around.  So they can go back in time and point to when this structure would have been facing the constellation  Leo, which we know in Mesopotamia, in Iraq, in Sumer, they knew about constellations.  They had them all marked down and they had already had, you know, cancer and Leo and they 
[00:42:30]  already had all those things.  So they know that this is possible, that that could be why this lion was built.  But there's two times it lines up.  One is 10,500 BC and the other one is 26,000 years before that.  And this John Anthony West guy is convinced because of hieroglyphs, because of the hieroglyphs  that depict the pharaohs that go back 30-plus thousand years.  But the Egyptologists don't want to accept that because it's too far outside of conventional 
[00:43:00]  wisdom as far as, like, how long people have been around.  They can't accept that 36,000-plus years ago there were pharaohs and Egypt was in, you  know, a modern, or at least an advanced state.  That's a lot of history that isn't accounted for.  If you can wrap it up in 2,000 years, then you'll look like a fucking genius.  Yeah, but even 2,000 years, man, when we start to think about 2,000 years, I mean, fucking  200 years ago, man.  I talk about this in my act, but if you want to picture something, you've got to fucking 
[00:43:30]  draw it.  There was no, it wasn't like you had to go to Washington where they had all the photos.  No, there were no fucking photos.  It hadn't been invented.  You know how annoying that would be after a gig, some fucking girl who can't even operate  a cell phone trying to draw a picture of you and her dumb boyfriend?  Imagine what her Facebook page would look like.  And that's only 200 years ago, man.  That's nothing.  Yeah, how about 50 years ago?  How about 50 years ago, walk up to a phone and say, someday, someone's going to watch  people fuck on that.  Right. 
[00:44:00]  I go, there's no way.  How is that phone going to eventually have video?  How's that phone going to have internet?  Even on Star Trek, they never figured out the internet.  How about only 10 years ago?  No, they never figured out that, they never figured out fucking, you know.  They didn't even figure out something.  They had walkie talkies.  That's basically, right?  They would say, over, perk out.  This is only 10 years old, what we're doing with our phones, basically.  It's incredible.  I love Star Wars, how the image of Leia, because when they zapped in that horrible image of  her, they have to continue with that, the hologram, they didn't figure out smartphones.  They thought that was awesome back then. 
[00:44:30]  It was totally awesome.  People are saying brain overload.  This shit is fascinating, man.  I love when J.D.L.  Hell yeah.  It is.  I love this shit.  The world is strange, man.  J.D.S.  Haldane said, not only is the world queerer than you suppose, it's queerer than you can suppose.  And it really is.  The deeper you go into this shit, the more you realize, like, God, like.  What do you think?  It's a blip.  Civilizations just over and over again, they come and go.  We get wiped out.  The Earth is very volatile.  The environment is, look, we know for a fact that we've been hit at least, I think they 
[00:45:00]  said there's been six major extinction events on Earth in the course of Earth.  And that's not counting super volcanoes, which they're just starting to comprehend.  They're just starting to wrap their head around the fact that there's volcanoes that when  they blow out west, that fucking Yellowstone won thousands of earthquakes a year.  People don't know this.  Yellowstone, and this is something they didn't realize until satellite technology, Yellowstone  is a caldera volcano that's, I believe it's 300 kilometers across. 
[00:45:30]  And what it is, is it's essentially a mountain that blows up so the mountain doesn't exist anymore.  The volcano is so big and so powerful that when it explodes, the whole mountain just shoots  fucking lava straight up in the air and just kills everything.  Kills everyone.  It's a continent killer.  And it happens every six to eight hundred thousand years.  And we're overdue.  Six hundred thousand years ago is the last time it happened.  Are we safe on the East Coast here in New York? 
[00:46:00]  No, I don't think so.  We're pretty far over.  People are going to be eating people when this happens.  Whatever people that are left.  The sun will be blocked out.  The fucking plants will die.  Nuclear winter.  Yeah.  It'll be a disaster.  And as humans, there's nothing we can do about it.  Well, you remember that little baby one that happened in Iceland and they had to cancel all  the flights?  You know, and you see how thick that shit was?  It was coming down on people while they were driving.  It was like it was heavy snowfall.  Right.  It was just ashes.  And that's a small one.  That's a little baby.  A little...  Oh, yeah.  That's nothing.  A little cough.  We can't even wrap our head around a fucking super volcano. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Or there's a gigantic shelf in the Canary Islands and it's going to fall off in the ocean.  It will happen eventually.  They don't know when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen.  And when it does, there's a fucking tsunami that's going to hit the East Coast and come  six, seven miles in.  Six, seven miles in with water.  I think my house might take a hit on Long Island.  I live in the sky, though.  We'll be all right, Jimmy.  Oh, and you live in the sky.  Do you know what that would be like?  Loud city.  I hope you have a fucking life raft in your apartment. 
[00:47:00]  You just look out your window and it's underwater.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you might not be okay.  It might be that high.  You know?  I mean, they have had thousand foot waves before.  It's a video.  The video you sent of the solar system, that was about a year ago.  Oh, that's a great one.  Of how small we actually are.  It's ridiculous, right?  What the fuck?  It's ridiculous when you see how small the Earth is in comparison to some stars that  we found.  And it just got bigger and bigger and bigger.  Most of us have seen the video by now.  We all tweeted it.  It was all because of Joe Rogan. 
[00:47:30]  That was unbelievable.  All that shit is very hard.  It's impossible, really, to put into context.  Because in our little temporary worlds, in our temporary life, we don't have the ability  to see that.  Our life is about moving forward and using the two eyes in the front of our head to find  food to stuff in our fucking mouth and find some place to put our dick so we can make  more people.  That's what we're here for.  But we're evolving into something else.  And we're in the process of it.  You know, you and I and all of us, especially, you know, through the medium like satellite 
[00:48:00]  radio and the internet and your phones and, you know, all that stuff is causing us to  evolve.  You know, and it's happening incredibly rapidly.  So fast.  We can't even imagine.  You think when you die, you just shut off?  Or is there some kind of crazy thing?  You might live this whole fucking thing over and over and over and over again.  And not only that, you might not really even die.  You might shut off and you might just wake right back up in some other state and not  even know.  I mean, the idea of parallel dimensions and parallel universes, there's a bunch of different 
[00:48:30]  theories about that.  But if parallel dimensions exist, they exist simultaneously.  They coincide with us all around us all the time.  And it's like changing radio dials or like anything else that we don't really quite,  you know, that we can't really wrap our head around.  Imagine if you died three times already.  Yeah.  Well, you might die every fucking day, man.  Who knows?  Every time you go to bed, you might be dying.  You know?  In some world, we might have lost Anthony, you know?  Yeah, man.  In our world, Anthony's up in the morning.  Can't pop up.  In some world, you know, Patrice is making people laugh right now.  Or he's talking to an in-shape Jim Norton. 
[00:49:00]  Like, you know, or a fucking Rachel Rogan.  Let's calm down.  Let's not get nutty.  Yeah.  That's good.  Well, the idea is that every decision that you make and every possible alternative and  every chance and every, you know, all the variables, that all these open up doors for  completely different universes.  Yeah.  Not only that, but that your own consciousness is somehow involved in creating this universe.  And whether or not it's involved in the actual manifestation of physical things, like 
[00:49:30]  you invent something and create it, and then it exists where it didn't exist before.  Not just that, but that your ideas and your mind actually shape the events that happen around you.  There's some people that say, oh, bad things always happen to me.  It very might be that you're making bad things happen to you.  We don't understand the amount of control that people actually have over reality.  Now, you know, you've heard about double slit, when they do subatomic particle things and, you know,  when they show that the observer actually changes the reaction of the particles. 
[00:50:00]  You've seen these things, right?  Oh, wow, no.  You've never seen these things?  Pull that up, because that'll fucking blow your head.  Look up Dr. Quantum double slit experiment.  You're going to shit your pants when you see this, because I can't believe you've never  seen this before.  But when they get into quantum theory, that's when the universe really falls apart.  Because quantum theory is real science, but it's real magic, too.  In quantum theory, particles can exist in a super state, a super position, which means 
[00:50:30]  that they can be moving and still at the same time.  Not only that, they blink in and out of existence.  And the latest experiments at CERN, you know, CERN is the Large Hadron Collider, the latest  experiments have shown that particles can travel faster than the speed of light.  They've recreated this already.  And there's a lot of people that are speculating, this doesn't make sense.  But particles don't make sense anyway.  It doesn't make sense that they can disappear.  They put their data online because they thought we might have made a mistake.  And they never do that, but I think they did like 15,000 tests on it.  Yeah.  So far, don't mistake. 
[00:51:00]  What are we about to see?  Particles are actually affected by you watching them.  It's not just a matter of you see something happen, but when you watch things happen, you  change actual physical particles.  Just check this out.  This will blow your head.  This will blow your mind.  Turn it so these guys can see this.  Crank that shit up.  The granddaddy of all quantum weirdness, the infamous double-slit experiment.  And this is explained as simply as possible.  Of course.  It would take an hour for a genius. 
[00:51:30]  We can get Michio Kaku on here and we're like, I don't know what he just said.  If we randomly shoot a small object, say a marble, at the screen, we see a pattern on  the back wall where they went through the slit and hit.  Now, if we add a second slit, we would expect to see a second band duplicated to the right.  Now, let's look at waves.  The waves hit the slit and radiate out, striking the back wall with the most intensity directly 
[00:52:00]  in line with the slit.  The line of brightness on the back screen shows that intensity.  This is similar to the line the marbles make.  But, when we add the second slit, something different happens.  If the top of one wave meets the bottom of another wave, they cancel each other out. 
[00:52:30]  So, now, there is an interference pattern on the back wall.  Holy shit.  Places where the two tops meet are the highest intensity, the bright lines, and where they  cancel, there is nothing.  This is the beginning of the mind fuck.  So, things, that is, matter, through two slits, we get this.  Two bands of hits.  And with waves, we get an interference pattern of many bands. 
[00:53:00]  Good so far.  Now, let's go quantum.  This guy's crazy.  An electron is a tiny, tiny bit of matter.  Like a tiny marble.  Let's fire a stream through one slit.  It behaves just like the marble.  A single band.  Right.  So, if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits, we should get, like the marble, two bands. 
[00:53:30]  What?  What?  An interference pattern.  We fired electrons.  Tiny bits of matter through.  But we get a pattern like waves.  Not like little marbles.  How?  How could pieces of matter create an interference pattern like a wave?  It doesn't make sense. 
[00:54:00]  No.  But, physicists are clever.  They thought, maybe those little balls are bouncing off each other and creating that pattern.  So, they decide to shoot electrons through one at a time.  There is no way they could interfere with each other.  But, after an hour of this, the same interference pattern is seen to emerge.  The conclusion is inescapable.  The single electron leaves as a particle, becomes a wave of potentials, goes through both slits, and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle. 
[00:54:30]  That's crazy.  But, mathematically, it's even stranger.  It goes through both slits, and it goes through neither.  And it goes through just one, and it goes through just the other.  All of these possibilities are in superposition with each other.  But, physicists were completely baffled by this.  So, they decided to peek, and see which slit it actually goes through. 
[00:55:00]  This is the mindfuck.  They put a measuring device by one slit, to see which one it went through, and let it fly.  But, the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could have imagined.  When they observed, the electron went back to behaving like a little marble.  It produced a pattern of two bands, not an interference pattern of many.  Just by watching it. 
[00:55:30]  The very act of measuring, or observing, which slit it went through, meant it only went through one, not both.  The electron decided to act differently.  As though it was aware, it was being watched.  That's fucked up right there.  And it was here.  Beyond strange.  That physicists stepped forever into the strange, never-world of quantum events. 
[00:56:00]  What is matter?  Marbles or waves?  And waves of what?  And what does an observer have to do with any of this?  Cartoon Sandusky.  That's where it's impossible to wrap your head around.  Your mind and your focus and your intent, just the human mind may very well change things.  May change reality.  My theory is they put the camera too close to the thing and it was just bouncing off it. 
[00:56:30]  They probably put it in front of the thing.  Could be, Jim.  Unfortunately, we've got to take a break because we have a million fucking live reads.  By the way, Dr. Cock, who would not explain that, he would explain that too simply.  And I think he's a genius, but he oversimplifies it and he would have it like, you know, it's like two Lego people are rolling bowling ball.  It's like we know that to tell us as a physicist.  Well, it must be so hard for a guy like that to try to break things down to monkeys like us.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  I remember like we had him on the phone that one time. 
[00:57:00]  We were talking to him.  I was like, how do I not offend this guy's mind with my stupid fucking questions?  Yeah, yeah.  He tries to put it in layman's terms and you know he's just like, because he started talking cartoons.  It is like when Bugs Bunny goes into his hole.  Is this what you really got to do?  You look at us and just think, I better talk cartoons.  He's seeing a giant chalkboard filled with numbers and symbols that we don't even understand and hieroglyphs.  He looks at us like we look at ants to be just hit with raid. 
[00:57:30]  We should have him explain that now.  It would be completely different.  Oh, very exciting.  Don't you guys have a hotline we can call him up?  Yeah, we call him up all the time.  We should actually ask him about that split.  Ask him about the observers, the quantum observer.  We do have to take a break.  Let's do it.  What time we got to get you out of here, Joe?  I don't know.  7.30?  Fucking Today Show, man.  Wow.  Fucking A.  Today Show.  They're just going to ask you Fear Factor questions.  Which we're all excited about.  Maybe I can cut right back over, because it's only a few minutes away.  Anthony Bourdain is here later.  Oh, is he? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  What is he?  You know him?  You love him, right?  He's in my podcast.  Yeah, NBC's a block away, so you could do this if you want to.  But Fear Factor starts Monday.  I think I leave at 8.30.  From here?  Shit.  I should fucking just bail on it.  I should just hang out here.  How great is that?  Oh, what time was I supposed to be there?  Bail on NBC for us?  No, I thought it was supposed to be there at 10.30.  That's pretty sweet.  Oh, I just said it on the radio too late.  Yeah, right.  All right, quick break.  More with Joe Rogan.  But Fear Factor starts Monday at 8 on NBC.  This is the OPA3 Channel. 
[00:58:30]  It's not the same like it was.  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa.  And you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectile dysfunction. 
[00:59:00]  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big fill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing. 
[00:59:30]  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype.  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul. 
[01:00:00]  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about a young Macaulay Culkin in the movie, My Girl.  I was crying a lot in the theater when I seen that one.  I couldn't see through my tears.  I had such a big lump in my sweatpants.  I love that movie.  Look at that.  You're all rough.  You got leaves on you.  Come here.  Let me muss your hair up.  Come here, Macaulay.  Look at your denim coat. 
[01:00:30]  I cried so hard.  He got the bees all over him.  I was like, be careful.  They're gonna start stinging on your penis.  Gotta get someone to suck the person out.  You got little bee stingers in your penis.  Why don't you come over here?  Let me get the bee stingers.  Your bee stingers.  Let me pull him out with my teeth.  I'll rescue you.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare. 
[01:01:00]  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Love and Joe Rogan on the show today.  Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 p.m. 
[01:01:30]  on NBC.  The cookie ate this morning just kicked in.  I don't think you're going to be discussing quantum physics with Matt Lauer today.  I don't know.  I'll have to talk to Matt Lauer.  I've got to go to the plaza.  I think it's...  Yeah.  Who's the other guy?  Al Roker.  I think Al Roker was on news radio back in the day.  I believe he was.  Was he really?  I don't know.  I'm trying to remember.  Somebody else who watches the show knows more than I do when I was on it.  We're not going to get Kaku.  We left him a message.  Damn it.  Yeah.  A message. 
[01:02:00]  He'll probably just fuck our heads up some more.  Oh, I know.  We'll just hang up and be like we have cotton in our brain.  We're stupid.  He's brilliant.  You know who knows a lot of physics?  Dr. Steve.  Yeah, he does.  He was a physics major.  And he explains it a little more technically than Kaku because he doesn't have to...  Because he's closer to us than Kaku is.  Yeah.  And he hates Kaku.  Dr. Steve is cool as fuck.  Yeah.  Why does he hate Dr. Kaku?  I don't know.  It's like some comics hate other comics.  He thinks Kaku's a hack.  Isn't that the worst?  When someone says, hey, what do you think about this guy?  You're like, well...  But why isn't he doing it for a living?  Because he's got a practice now. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  When he gets to look at vagus, he'll probably get creeped out by a little bit of a physicist.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve is just creepy.  Yeah.  It's a strange world, man.  When you see those guys...  Whenever you watch any of those quantum physics documentaries, you see those guys just sitting  like in a park with a notebook, just going over shit that, you know, it might as well  be make-believe.  You don't know what they're writing down.  I mean, you ever watch like...  You know, like remember that Good Will Hunting thing?  Sure.  When Matt Damon solved some puzzle?  What is that puzzle?  Yeah, what is that?  It's a make-believe. 
[01:03:00]  How many people on Earth understand that shit?  That's a good question.  What do you think, though?  It's a tiny, tiny fraction.  Well, you know...  Less than 1%, obviously, right?  I love that.  When somebody looks at the blackboard and everything's written on it, and someone just  walks up, takes the chalk, and goes, no, this is a little wrong right here.  At the bottom, and it's like, oh my God, how did you get that answer?  It's like, oh, you see, you're just too embarrassed.  He was a Russian scientist or a Russian mathematician who just solved some thought-to-be-impossible  equation, and he won some massive prize, like over a million dollars, and he decided he 
[01:03:30]  didn't want it.  Wasn't he young?  He didn't claim it.  Was he really young?  Yeah.  What?  But who came up with the equation to begin with?  I mean, young like he's like 30-something.  But who came up with the equation that's impossible?  Oh, I don't understand.  I'm an idiot when it comes to math.  So wouldn't that guy know the answer?  My brain is fucking...  There's people's brains that are designed for certain things, you know?  I'm really good at pointing out stupid shit.  I can talk some shit on stage.  I understand fighting.  I understand human nature.  But goddamn, if math just has fucking stumped the shit out of me.  You make me calculate 20%, I'm just like, eh? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey!  I know 10, so I'll just do that twice.  I was trying to figure...  Taking a shit yesterday, trying to figure...  This girl had tweeted something, but she tweeted the same thing over and over to a bunch of  different people.  And, you know, and I said, honey, you wrote the same thing to 100 people.  And she goes, you better learn how to count, because I only did to four people.  And I was like, okay, four, but you only have 73 tweets.  Now, what percentage of your tweets have been dedicated to this exact same thing?  It took me like 10 minutes to figure out that it's somewhere around five. 
[01:04:30]  We can help you with the 20% thing.  I tried to do it in my head, though.  But I'm like, let's see how much of an idiot I actually am.  That's a fucking...  What a shit mind I have here.  Working with this shitty tool.  Not quite the beautiful mind, right?  Is it a girl tweeting a song that she wants everybody to listen to?  Well, no, but...  Oh, that...  I just blocked her.  I made a mistake of retweeting her one day.  Never.  Now she won't leave me the fuck alone.  I emailed her once.  I'm like, go away!  And I'm like, you want people...  You don't want to just be a joke. 
[01:05:00]  You want to have something that's good.  I actually sent her a nice email, and she's just sociopathic in her desire to be noticed.  I blocked her.  I retweeted her as being an asshole, and that just got her going.  Like, she was psyched that she got a retweet.  Yeah, I have no desire to.  Some chick tweeted a Michael Jackson lyric, if you want to make the world a better place,  take a look at yourself and make a change.  Ooh.  And she tweeted that.  Like, ooh, profound.  Really?  You're talking to a guy who carved his fucking face up, and he says,  slept in a fucking oxygen chamber, and, you know, eventually was getting anesthetized 
[01:05:30]  every night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he made a change.  Yeah.  Good quote.  He looked at the man in the mirror and saw Diana Ross.  What a creep.  How fucked up is it, though, you go to Propofol to fall asleep?  Yeah, that guy went deep.  Well, you know, I think when you have enough people, yes, man, and you, it gets to that  point, actually, right?  You know how that guy was, Conrad Murray?  Yeah.  How funny was him, man?  There's a video of a stripper.  It was on fucking CNN.com.  Like, this was news.  It was a stripper that was on the witness stand.  And they were, do you know Mr. Conrad Murray? 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  This is how she said.  Every question was, yes.  And when did you meet Mr. Murray?  Was it at your place of business?  Yes.  And do you work as an exotic dancer?  Yes.  And, you know, it's just basically establishing that this guy liked strippers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's like, it was so funny because the chick that was saying this, you  know, the prosecutor, it was like, you could tell, like, she was so confident that she  had something really great here.  This guy likes strippers. 
[01:06:30]  Like, he wanted, you know, and it's like, it's a hot button, it's a gotcha, it's a, you're  not allowed to like that.  Right.  You're not allowed to like that.  Oh, you were a doctor and you had a relationship with a stripper.  A stripper, oh boy.  Who cares?  This guy was flying him around and fucking just banging him left and right.  Michael Jackson was giving him, like, $100,000 a week.  This guy was balling, son.  Yeah, here it is right here.  The defendant.  Listen, this is news, man.  Meanwhile, she's hot as fuck. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  Murray the defendant.  Yes.  Did you meet Conrad Murray in February of 2008?  Yes.  Look how hot she is.  Oh, baby.  Listen, I will give you a job.  You don't have to work.  Yes.  Were you working yourself?  That yes is weird, man.  Yes.  Was that club located in Las Vegas?  Yes.  Spearman, right up for the win.  This fellow from that first meeting with Conrad Murray. 
[01:07:30]  It's all quest.  Did he give you his telephone number?  Yes.  Ah.  That would be hot if she was sucking your dick.  Let me tell you that.  Oh, man.  Did you contact him on the phone number that he had provided to you when you met in the club?  Can I put it in your ass?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Do you like that?  She really does string that ass almost.  And after your first meeting, did you and Conrad Murray communicate back and forth?  Yes.  I just want to hear her do that all day.  Yeah.  Can you have with him, please? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, no.  Oh.  Don't get her to talk.  No talking.  Just yes.  Your question's irrelevant.  Miss Bella.  Miss Bella.  Fuck out of here.  Alexis.  Did you call Conrad Murray on the telephone number that he provided to you when he met you  in the club?  Yes.  Did he call you?  Back.  Or did he make contact by calling you?  Yes.  Did Conrad Murray send you text messages?  It's a hot yes, though.  It's hot.  Yes.  Did you text messages?  It's hot.  It never is. 
[01:08:30]  It's pretty fucking hot, Joe.  She's a dirty girl.  That he had given you.  Yes.  Girlie, if you're out there, holler at me.  Find me.  We need to talk on Twitter.  Conrad Murray looks like beef jerky.  Conrad Murray send you a text on June 5th.  You've got to check out his podcast, obviously.  Yes.  You never know when he's doing it, but.  Yes.  Yes.  She's fucking hot, man.  But don't you hate lawyers?  Look at her.  She shows up at court and her tits are hanging out.  Yeah.  What a dirty girl.  Yes.  She doesn't know any other way to dress.  Like, this is how I'm supposed to dress, right? 
[01:09:00]  Is there any videos of her online or anything?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know where her name was.  I'm sure that's fine.  He had a hot baby mama, too.  He had a very attractive baby mama.  It's hilarious, man.  This guy was just bawling on Michael Jackson's money.  That's right.  He had a good life.  Make a change.  Yes.  Make a change.  Na, na, na, na.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  What a strange...  You talk about, like, a real epic story.  The story of Michael Jackson, if anybody ever does it, they'll have to use CGI to actually 
[01:09:30]  do it, right?  I mean, no one's willing to fucking do that to their face for...  Imagine if someone, you know, Daniel Day-Lewis that and go, I'm going to get all the surgeries  and everything.  They filmed it over a course of, like, five years and it's the only role he could ever  do again.  Or just hire different actors to play him.  Yeah.  Like, you know, like a black male and then a white woman.  But that would suck.  You know, I hate a movie where you see, like, the guy's a kid and then you see all of a  sudden the scene merges and he's a grown man.  And now you're like, how did that fucking kid become that guy?  Yeah.  A couple of times they did a good job on it with some movies. 
[01:10:00]  But for the most part, it's like...  It takes you out of the movie.  But the Michael Jackson story of him being, you know, this amazing child prodigy, he was  such a bad motherfucker that they let him sing and his older brothers didn't get to  sing.  His older brothers were like, this mother...  Check this little motherfucker out.  They were shaving at that point.  They were grown men.  They were dancing, getting pussy.  And their little five-year-old is in the front.  Right.  Jackson 5.  And the five-year-old is the bad one.  He's dancing and everybody's cheering and loving him.  And these guys are like, what about us? 
[01:10:30]  What about us?  Yeah, yeah.  You imagine, you're the older fucking brother.  And your younger brother comes along and just shocks the world.  Like, no one's ever seen a talent like that.  And then you watch that guy slowly evolve into this complete fucking weirdo.  Remember when he was in that interview with that Indian dude?  The guy with the British accent?  And the guy was like, asking him all these questions about sleeping with men.  Martin Bashir, yeah.  Martin Bashir.  We got children.  He lives in the neighborhood.  Does he live in your neighborhood?  Yeah, I see him all the time at the dumb juice store.  Do you ever talk to him? 
[01:11:00]  I should.  What was it like to be around Michael Jackson?  I should.  He's not approachable, though.  Bank of lights in front of him.  He had, like, all these, like, crazy lights to make himself, you know, he wanted no shadows  anywhere.  He wanted just completely flushed out skin, you know, really weirded out.  Yeah.  I mean, Michael Jackson controlled, like, that whole interview.  And it's so uber bizarre.  He doesn't even know how to be normal.  When they took him around, he was, like, buying things.  And even the way he buys things is odd.  It's just strange. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, he's just picking things up.  I want that.  It's just so strange.  You're fucking crazy.  But you go back from this kid.  You had no idea how to be a human.  You think you touched kids, Joe?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think that many kids come out and say you touched them if there's not something  up.  I don't know if he fucked them or if he, you know, maybe masturbated in front of them.  That's what a lot of the stories were.  None of the kids say he actually fucked them.  You know, the kids said he did stuff like he went down on them and stuff.  I think, you know, there's another theory that Michael Jackson was castrated, that he's 
[01:12:00]  a, you know, a castrato.  That's why he can hit those notes.  Oh, shit.  That's not the notes that a man with testicles is capable of singing.  You know, I mean, I don't, that sounds completely fucking conspiracy theory.  Well, he obviously didn't father those children.  Yeah, exactly.  Isn't that why his nose was made thinner, too?  Like, to help with the air passing through for certain notes.  I heard that was one reason that he wanted to keep his nose thin.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  He didn't want to look like his dad.  That's why he changed his nose.  Yeah, he's his fucking dad.  Yeah, he, you know, I mean, he might have used that excuse, but he had such a big, wide 
[01:12:30]  nose as a kid.  And then he became this weirdo, man.  Yeah, this was a great interview.  Yeah.  That's Bashir.  Hey.  Martin Bashir.  Even, I mean, he became like some weird leprechaun monster character, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, to go from Michael Jackson, the young kid, to this weird, high-pitched voice man  who lives this fantasy life where he has an amusement park in his backyard and brings  little kids over.  And clearly his childhood sucked hard.  You know, he did not enjoy it. 
[01:13:00]  And he wants to recreate it and recapture it and sort of make it his own now that he's,  you know, now that he's a man.  And that was like sort of what I was getting out of it.  But as a story, it's, we've never seen that happen before.  Someone getting really famous when they're really young and then becoming this thing,  you know, that's a relatively new possibility.  Right.  The possibility of becoming a child star, the Lindsay Lohans of the world.  I mean, you know, Shirley Temple was probably the first one, right?  But even then, the kind of exposure that she got was nothing compared to what people get 
[01:13:30]  today.  Now forget about it.  He was literally the biggest star on the planet.  On the planet.  And Africa, in Asia, here.  He couldn't go anywhere.  Yeah.  And even with his fucking crazy face, they never abandoned him.  They just sort of accepted that he fucked with his face.  You know?  I mean, he was super bizarre, man.  Was he in Vegas?  Yeah.  And he goes to just, that's when he was living in Vegas.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And then he moved to fucking, he moved to Dubai.  Remember that?  Yeah.  He had a bunch of boys with him in Dubai.  Did he have boys with him?  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  He has photos with him and kids wearing turbans and shit.  Or kids wearing burqas.  In Vegas with the luckiest manager in the world.  How about that?  You bought that?  The glow?  Yeah.  Right?  How about the glow?  Where'd he go upstairs?  We're taking you upstairs.  Yeah.  He just decides, I want this, I want that.  Hi.  Everybody goes, there's people just watching him.  Giant crowd of people holding cameras.  I need that. 
[01:14:30]  I bought this one.  This one.  Why?  This one.  Yeah, like, what is he buying?  It's all weird shit.  What is he buying?  Like, just weird shit.  I don't, you can't even describe it.  Isn't it beautiful, this set?  He just walks on, I want this chest set.  No, this one's bigger.  This is bigger.  Wow.  Oh, it's so good.  I can put the bishop up my ass.  Is this yours?  It's great.  That's the so sign, it's for me.  Okay, how much is that one?  The so sign, it's for me.  It's only 89,000.  89,000 for a chest set. 
[01:15:00]  Asshole is broke.  89,000 bucks.  Where is all this shit now?  Did you ever see his house?  Like, when they showed, like, the interior of his house?  It's fucking amazing, man.  Where's all that stuff now?  I bet the family fucking dove in, like, vultures for that shit.  Well, he's worth more now than he ever was when he was alive.  Once he died.  Elvis syndrome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  That shit just never goes away.  Yeah.  It'll just be a cash cow.  Yeah.  Forever.  I mean, you go back and see the, it's Matt Lauer. 
[01:15:30]  It was a room filled with artwork.  These walls had huge paintings on them, some depicting Michael Jackson in whimsical or magical situations.  Oh, yeah.  Matt Lauer tells a stinky pussy joke.  I bet.  Fuck yeah.  Do you think so?  He is a man.  But I think he's been neutered.  A lot of these news guys are fucking filthy, man.  You ever hang out with, like, news people in a bar?  It's hilarious.  They have a few drinks, and they're fucking racist and dirty and fucking, it's hilarious.  It's because they're suppressed all day. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, they're totally suppressed.  What about that weatherman in Arkansas that died in the bathroom?  His friend died in the bathtub.  He woke up next to me and died in a fucking...  The guy who owned the house came downstairs because he heard snoring.  Right, yeah.  And he comes down here, he's snoring, and there's a guy who's the weatherman, and next to him,  touching him, leaning up against him, he's a man with a purple face, dead, with a dog  collar on.  And meanwhile, he's snoring.  Yeah.  He's asleep, touching this dead guy.  Like, he didn't even know this guy died on him. 
[01:16:30]  That's unbelievable.  And then he woke him up.  The guy woke up, he looked at the dead guy, ran out into the guy's living room, and just  started puking.  Yeah, isn't that hilarious?  In the guy's living room.  What a scene.  That's a hell of a fucking scene, man.  That's a party, man.  That's a hell of a party.  That's how you know you party when the guy you party with fucking dies.  What about the weatherman that we fucking knew and ran into a few times that just...  Meanwhile, there's a weather guy right there while we're saying this.  See, like, up on the screen?  They're all just odd fucks.  Which weatherman? 
[01:17:00]  That guy that just loves fucking telling filthy jokes, and just, you don't see him.  Oh, what's his name?  When he's not on the TV, he's just telling horrible, filthy jokes, being completely inappropriate  to any female in the workplace, around him and shit.  And they all just know, it's like, when I was going out with Jill, we were around him  every so often, and he would just say, yeah, there he is.  I don't know if you want to mention his name.  He is beloved in this area.  We'll cut up some slack right now, but... 
[01:17:30]  I'll tell you this much, he loves the Asian brunts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  He loves the Asian brunts.  What was he talking about?  Only Asians.  And he doesn't like if they know too much English.  He goes to the overseas ones, and he's beloved, man.  I've seen him with a few different...  I was at a party once, and he came up to me, he just started saying shit like, would you  love to shove it in her asshole?  Fuck it.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy is filthy.  Because he met us, and he was excited to meet us, like, oh, fuck, I can finally...  Someone I can talk to. 
[01:18:00]  I can spew some filth.  I was like, these shock jocks will listen to me.  Can you imagine what it's like to be in that fucking really suppressed world?  Ugh.  Can you imagine if you had to do that?  If you had to be, like, a radio DJ?  Not a radio DJ, you know, an afternoon guy on one of these news talk shows.  I wouldn't be doing this if we were neutered.  Fuck that.  That's not just neutered, man.  I mean, you're reading off a prompt.  Right.  You have no input into it.  No real thought at all.  There's no thought at all.  You're just...  Like, I watched Ryan Seacrest when he's talking about Kim Kardashian's wedding or something 
[01:18:30]  like that.  I'm like, do you really give a fuck about this?  And you're not connected.  You're just reading this stuff off of a prompter.  Imagine if that was your whole life.  Your whole life was just only doing that kind of stuff.  I guess it depends on the money they're going to give you.  Right.  Yeah, but after a while, you'd still go fucking crazy.  Yeah, you'd need an outlet.  He's making close to $100 million a year.  Who, Ryan Seacrest?  Oh, fuck you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a rare, though.  He's a rare case.  But what I'm saying is, like, any of these guys, any news reporter guy...  But you know they're all full of shit.  Remember Pat O'Brien?  Remember when that guy went nutty?  Oh, yeah.  That was some of the great...  Isn't that beautiful?  I didn't even remember.  It was great.  It carried our show for a year. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, it's that thing.  It's the guy who, on one side...  Betsy.  It was Betsy.  Betsy.  On one side, he's this, like, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.  Another show with family comedy, and there's another program, and what a great movie to  take the whole family and the kids to.  All right, back to you, Tim.  The whole time, he's thinking about blow and sticking fingers and assholes and coming  up people's noses.  He's just ready to get crazy. 
[01:19:30]  He's got a secret.  He's going to say to the girl, if you like this, when I walk by, just wink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, he just wanted her to acknowledge that she wanted to suck his cock.  No, this dumb fuck is leaving messages.  Fucking secret languages.  Bill O'Reilly, too.  Same fucking thing.  Oh, yeah.  Bill O'Reilly.  Oh, yeah.  Bill O'Reilly.  Same fucking thing.  But he got her to shut up.  He was able to sweep that shit away.  I wonder how much they paid that shit for.  I would love to know what the story was.  Because that sounded like audio, the way she described it.  It sounded like a transcript.  Yeah.  The way she described it.  Like, I think he knew there possibly could be audio or something. 
[01:20:00]  That's smart.  Well, it was a transcript.  Well, it was.  We got something for you, because you're talking about the news guys.  This just came out today.  A drunk news anchor.  Drunk on the air?  Oh, yeah.  This guy is just a fucking trip.  A girl?  It's a girl, sorry.  Oh, she's drunk.  How about that one girl that had that sort of half a seizure?  The bertation.  And then she was fine.  Yeah.  Weird, huh?  Some residents were celebrating a new addition at the New Ulm Medical Center this afternoon.  The Virginia Piper Cancer Institute opened, and new members were invited to an open house with food and tours. 
[01:20:30]  Of course, the new institute is twice the size of the old center, and incorporates more treatment options to employees.  Clinical trials and genetic testing are also offered with the expansion.  Family's in to help design.  Wow.  Can we see her face?  Yeah, I want to see her.  How do you know she's drunk?  Do they say it?  Can we pick it up from your video? 
[01:21:00]  Is that her right there?  Is that the video?  Yeah.  The big girl?  Let's take a look from Sam's.  I feel like the Christmas season is here and near Waseca.  She might just be stupid.  Yeah, she looks retarded.  The fucking thing it says, is news anchor drunk or just Minnesotan?  Today's event features Christmas music, food, and a chance to meet.  The Santa dog, they felt three ways for Christmas, parents, and grandparents.  She might have just got hit with a fastball. 
[01:21:30]  Really the first major thing of springtime on the farm, so even though it's snow and drive.  She has like fucking stupid eyes to close to the expression.  Yeah, she looks doped up.  Other events today included holiday card making, tree lighting, and bedo for the kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Pills are more likely because pills make people pretty functional.  Look at Rush Limbaugh was taking a hundred of them a day and doing his radio show.  Amazing.  He took so much OxyContin he went deaf.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what happened to his fucking dumb ears? 
[01:22:00]  That's what Alex Jones says and I'm sticking to it.  Okay.  Alex Jones says it.  He was taking a fuckload of pills.  Good old Alex Jones.  He was taking massive amounts.  But at one point in time they said he was up to like a hundred a day.  Wow.  That's like just taking pills.  How did your body handle that shit?  But that's taking pills all day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All day.  Like you just have to constantly be taking pills.  Well, not really.  You know, if you're taking ten at a time, you only have to do it ten times.  That's true.  Okay.  Look at me.  Ten times, dummy.  I'm just thinking one at a time.  Exactly.  Flooding up with OxyContin. 
[01:22:30]  That's ten hours.  Ten.  Ten hours of pill taking.  It's amazing.  Every hour you're doing another ten.  That was good math, by the way, Joe.  What a nutty, crazy motherfucker he is, huh?  You think you're not good at math?  You fucking came right out with a pill analogy.  How ridiculous is that guy?  Talking all this shit about drug addicts.  Meanwhile, he had his fucking housekeeper going and buying pills.  That whole situation in Florida is really set up to make junkies.  They have no database.  No, really?  Yeah.  If you were a doctor in Florida and I go to Dr. Opie and I get a prescription on,  my back hurts, they have these things called pain management centers in Florida. 
[01:23:00]  They don't exist anywhere else.  And what it is is you go to a doctor, you go to the pain management center, there's a doctor.  He writes your prescription for OxyContin and you go right next door to the same fucking  building and there's a prescription.  You know, the pharmacy, they fill out your prescription and then you go across the street  to Dr. Anthony and you go, Dr. Anthony, my back hurts.  And they can't even check.  There's no database.  Are they allowed that?  Because they're trying to move more OxyContin.  It's that simple.  It's 100%.  That's the only reason why they wouldn't reform that law. 
[01:23:30]  It's because the pharmaceutical companies are making fucking billions of dollars this way.  Not only that, there's a lot of suspicion that the pharmaceutical companies are leaking  drugs into the black market because there's more in the black market than corresponds  with the amount of prescriptions written.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So they're like, well, these numbers aren't even fucking adding up.  Like, they'll find people with giant fucking stashes of OxyContin.  You know, they'll arrest someone.  Like, where'd you get this shit?  And then, you know, they, you know, oh, I got it at the pain management center in Florida.  They call it the OxyContin Express because people drive from all these other estates all 
[01:24:00]  the way down to Florida.  Vanguard did a whole piece on it on their TV show.  Why is it only Florida, though?  How come other places don't have it?  Because they're corrupt.  Because Florida figured out a way.  I mean, the pharmaceutical companies figured out a way to bribe one state.  And they got that one state wired.  There's a couple other states where it's similar.  I think West Virginia, one or two others, but none of them are as lenient as Florida.  Florida's the most one.  I bet they get away with it, too, because it's like, oh, well, we got a lot of old, retired  people here.  We're at the, you know, the twilight of their life, and they need pain management. 
[01:24:30]  And, yeah, let's set up a bunch of those fucking laws.  Yeah, that's probably exactly the argument that they use.  Yeah, it's fucking completely insane.  The feds off their ass.  I mean, they'll arrest the shit out of you if you got some weed.  Krishna from Jersey knows what that reporter is on.  Oh, yeah?  Krishna, go ahead.  Hey, yeah, that chick's high on Xanax.  Oh, yeah?  The verbal slurring, that kind of demented look in her eyes, those are all very, very common  signs of Xanax.  I've been a fan of a little Xanax buzz every so often. 
[01:25:00]  I've never done Xanax.  What is that like?  What's the buzz like?  Well, I've never done it either, but I teach EMS, and we see people.  What's EMS?  Emergency Medical Services.  You see people that give these prescriptions from doctors that really don't give a shit  about their patients.  They just want to shut them up and give them pills.  And I had a student, actually, once trip on Xanax, and she was totally lucid the whole  time.  She was actually teaching part of the class.  Wow.  Xanax is like a lot of NyQuil, it feels like. 
[01:25:30]  You kind of get a little euphoric, but a little, like, sleepy.  And, yeah, I always thought it seemed like, you know that scene in Pulp Fiction where Travolta  shoots up and he's driving?  Yeah.  And his face is just kind of half a smile and he licks his lips and takes a breath.  That's kind of how you feel.  Just kind of, ah.  Relaxed.  And it's for anxiety, right?  Yeah.  Well, it makes sense that she's kind of a big girl.  Maybe she gets real nervous about being on camera.  And so she popped an extra one. 
[01:26:00]  Somebody left her a horrid Facebook message.  Hey, you fat bitch.  You fat cunt.  You fucking reading sucks.  Give me a fucking sandwich.  Read that teleprompter, you stupid bitch.  You're never good at anything.  Go suck some more dicks.  Hey, you're the silent.  Yes.  The meanest shit, man.  Yes.  If you want to know what the fucking future of the world is, read YouTube comments.  If you don't think this race is a cancer, read those little negative fucking virus humans. 
[01:26:30]  Fuck you.  Virus humans.  Fuck you.  Virus humans.  There are the little bugs.  I love that.  Every now and then you'll have a video and a bunch of people will like it.  I'm a virus human.  You see it.  Just one negative fuck hanging on to life.  Great court case, too.  That's really funny, man.  A fucking blogger who tried to claim journalistic protection for defamation against a lawyer lost.  They said, fuck you.  The court said, no, you're not a mainstream journalist. 
[01:27:00]  Because journalists have protection against defamation for certain things.  What did this guy do?  He said that a lawyer was a thief.  Like a lawyer who handled the case, whatever.  This lawyer was a thief and incompetent.  Things you can't say about a lawyer.  Like you could say, I hated my lawyer.  I think my lawyer sucked.  But to say your lawyer is a thief is defamation.  Sure.  I bet I could have gotten better representation.  You could say things like that.  But if you're like, he's a liar and a thief.  That's bad things to say.  And a judge said, you do not have journalistic.  So all these fucking cunty bloggers.  You should be able to express an opinion. 
[01:27:30]  But I love the fact these little cunts are going to start getting stuck to them.  Well, the saddest thing about a lot of these bloggers is that's the only way they feel they get attention.  So it's almost like that is the job.  The job is to be cunty.  Right.  The job is being this.  The only way anybody's paying attention to you.  Because it's the only thing unique about your opinion at all.  The only thing unique is that you're willing to be like really unaware of this person's feelings.  It's going to be hearing this.  And you're really like, you don't care at all.  This is what I have to say.  Fuck them.  Fuck you.  It's the easiest way to write stuff, too. 
[01:28:00]  It's like you don't really have to put a lot of thought behind just bashing somebody.  It's so easy.  Everybody's flawed.  We do it here every day.  Yeah.  It's fucking.  Well, at least you guys are funny, though.  You know, that's.  Look, it's half of life.  But they're anonymous a lot of times, too.  Because everything's fucked up.  The anonymity is what I hate.  Oh, yeah.  I don't hate a guy using his real name.  It's a really weird thing.  When a guy comes out and just says shit I don't like.  If he's being himself, I have a certain amount of respect for that because he's entitled to it.  But it's when they have this fucking.  Showing his face.  It's when they fucking hide that I just love when they're uprooted and fucking humiliated. 
[01:28:30]  I was trying to get.  I was thinking of getting into a Twitter argument last night.  I read something and I'm like, I started and I'm like, I got 140 characters.  I just I'm not in the mood.  Yeah.  And then I just blocked him.  I blocked everybody.  I'm like, I don't care.  I would have argued this point.  I was like, fuck it, block.  You know, they busted another chick in Louisiana, a really hot chick who fucks some 13 year old boy at Bible camp.  Loved it.  So I, you know, I tweeted with a hashtag. 
[01:29:00]  Where was this hooker when I was 13?  And, you know, like everybody do it.  Just joked around about it.  Like this is to me, you know, and whenever you, you know, as a comic or you see a story like that in the news, you just you laugh and it's easy.  I have to put something like this on Twitter.  People want to read this story.  And so some fucking asshole takes this tweet and tweets it to Anderson Cooper and TMZ and says, Joe Rogan endorses rape because, you know, he asked me, like, you know, that you're saying that the standards are different.  If it's, you know, if this is a man who's doing it to a woman as opposed to a woman doing it to a boy. 
[01:29:30]  And I go, yes, if he's 13 and she's hot.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  Completely different.  It's good.  There's no sexual equality when it comes to child molesting.  Right.  It's a different, completely different experience.  Totally.  Every guy at 13 dreamt of having sex.  I was blessed by a chick when I was 13.  Sort of.  I mean, sort of.  She just sort of grabbed my dick and kissed me and made out with me and stuff.  But I was fine.  How old was she?  I was fine.  Everything's good.  She was 21.  Wow.  Yeah.  She was hot, too.  She was crazy.  She had a boyfriend that was a man, too.  This sort of freaked me out.  She was just a neighborhood slut. 
[01:30:00]  And her boyfriend was a fucking construction worker and he had a big, hairy chest and he was a man.  And I remember seeing this guy.  I'm like, this is her boyfriend.  He's a fucking man.  Meanwhile, she was just a freak.  Yeah.  You couldn't get enough dicks in front of her.  She loves some girls.  That's the exact same thing happened to me on California.  Same fucking thing.  But if it's an older guy, if it's an older guy with a 13-year-old girl, then she's a dick.  I think some girls, they just want to be the first.  They see a guy, he's young and he's 13.  He's like, I'm going to get him before he even becomes a man.  And I'm going to be the first one to rock his fucking world. 
[01:30:30]  Because I think every girl secretly wants to be remembered forever by a guy.  And their number one fear is that the guy's just going to use him like a fleshlight.  Just dump a load in him, completely forget about him and run away.  They all want to be, even if they don't even, if it doesn't work out with the man, what a woman would love is in the back of her head to be that fucking fantasy.  That when the baby's crying and the wife is fat and she's screaming at you and you leave the house for a cigarette and you're standing out there in the driveway, you wish, maybe I could have been with Mary. 
[01:31:00]  Because Mary sucked my dick when I was 13.  That crazy 21-year-old bitch.  God, never.  She would have stayed with her.  You know, for a woman to plant a romantic seed like that, it sounds crazy, but that's what a lot of these bitches are doing.  A lot of these bitches are just getting their first licks in.  They know.  They're like, this is not ripe yet.  It's not ripe.  I'm taking a bite anyway.  I'm doing it.  I'm taking a bite anyway.  There's a lot of people looking at this piece of fruit and I'm going to bite it.  And there's my legacy right there.  He's going to fucking keep my pussy alive in his head. 
[01:31:30]  Well, that's the reality TV right there.  The desire to be extremely famous all comes from the same source.  The desire to be special.  The desire to be special for no reason whatsoever.  Just to fucking get in there.  That's it, man.  I think we've got to get you out of here for NBC.  Fuck NBC.  Do you still eat bite later?  Do you use your state number?  I think I'm good for another half an hour.  Oh, the fuck?  Yeah.  Oh, 830.  Stupid Roland telling me 8 o'clock.  Ah, Roland's an idiot.  Do you still use your state number?  No, I haven't used it in forever.  I haven't used mine either.  I don't think it works anymore.  People have been tweeting me that it doesn't work anymore. 
[01:32:00]  They might have went under.  It was fun, though.  It was.  I used to do, like, little things where I would get on it and I would just answer phone calls  from people.  I never actually went live.  I mean, once I did.  It's fun because all the other people can hear you.  So all the people that...  It's like being on hold on a radio station.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And a bunch of people are calling in.  And so, you know, one time I had, like, you know, 30 or 40 people on and I was just  answering one after the other and I put it on Twitter.  It was really fun.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I don't know if it exists anymore.  They were tying into something else.  They were really nice people, the people that ran it, and they got bought out by somebody  and they were trying to do something with it and I just don't know. 
[01:32:30]  When did they get bought out?  How long ago?  I don't know.  Jonathan told me and I just went in when I got together.  It's all changing so fast, man.  It really is, dude.  Twitter's here to stay, though, I think.  Yeah, but it'll become something else.  How do they make your money off of Twitter?  That's the problem.  No, say now.  It doesn't exist anymore.  Wow.  It was acquired by Google for media increase.  Wow.  It doesn't exist anymore.  Say now.  It's done.  Why didn't Google bought it and now they're probably doing something with it?  Why don't they fucking stop?  No, they're taking over everything.  They're Skynet.  But they're also...  What didn't work?  Google Buzz didn't work. 
[01:33:00]  And this fucking...  What's this one now they got?  Google is rocking.  Google Plus stinks.  You heard about this client IQ software issue that they're having.  Massive class action lawsuit about the client IQ software.  Everything you say, every fucking dirty text you make, every phone number you press  is all logged and stored in a database somewhere.  That's fucked up.  Every Google phone has it.  Every droid.  Unless you root it and put in a different operating system like a lot of those super  geeks do.  But some guy had to find this, man.  Some fucking genius kid found this stuff. 
[01:33:30]  You know, no one knew that this was in there.  And everybody's like, what the fuck are you doing, man?  The guy shows every text he wrote.  He goes, hello, world.  And it shows it in the computer that it's sending out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Everything he wrote.  If you send a picture, every number that you press on the dial.  You just take for granted that you're sending it from point A to point B.  And it's going through so many channels during that transfer.  And you take it for granted that it's just going to, you're going to see it.  And then the end person's going to see it at the end of the line?  No.  We're becoming part of one. 
[01:34:00]  It is a really weird evolution.  One giant collective conscious.  Because we're eventually, when we start thinking, like Bernie, what the fuck is it?  Not Kozar.  Ray?  Ray Kurzweil.  Kurzweil, yeah.  Was saying that we're all going to be part of this.  And I believe when computers are part of our brain and we can just think Google and think  what we want, we're all going to know what each other is thinking.  Thoughts will no longer be private.  We'll be punished for certain thoughts.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying that that's wrong.  Eventually, it's where we're going to evolve to.  That's a step along the way.  What it is, is there's a bridge between the monkey and whatever the fuck we're going to become. 
[01:34:30]  And we are the bridge.  We're the halfway mark between whatever event.  Unquestionably, there's going to be no secrets.  It's going in that direction.  With Facebook already, you see the lack of privacy that people have.  And they're willing to give it up.  Yeah.  What you know about people you just do not even know is amazing.  The amount of information you can get on a person.  Do you ever feel like a creep because someone sends you a message and for whatever reason 
[01:35:00]  you see someone's face and you go, wow, she's really pretty.  Let me click on her link.  Oh, this is her husband's page.  And this is what he does.  This is what he works for.  And then you just go into some strange person's world for like 20 minutes.  You're like, what the fuck am I doing?  Looking at pictures of them with their babies.  Here's them in the snow.  Here's them on the beach.  And you're like, I don't even know these people, but I'm looking at their life.  I'm not part of their lives.  Yeah, but I get fascinated by it, man.  I mean, that is the lure of reality TV is just a voyeuristic sort of, you know, looking 
[01:35:30]  into people's lives thing.  They say it's related to the fact that we don't live in tribes anymore, you know, and  that we used to gossip amongst each other in tribes.  And that's sort of gone because very few people are even in contact with your neighbors  anymore.  Very few people have like real communities.  My neighbor's an asshole.  Yeah.  I don't talk to that fucking asshole.  That's what he says.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In this case, he's the asshole.  What does he do?  He's just a dick.  Every time he sees me, he goes, can I help you?  I'm like, I live on this fucking floor.  Does he want to help you? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Maybe he looks at your cock balls and thinks you need a release.  Maybe he's just got an aggressive way of picking up on dudes.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Maybe he's tries to make you feel uncomfortable.  Yeah.  That's his move.  That's his one-upsmanship move.  Can I help you?  Well, I was thinking about sucking dicks.  Yes.  You were.  You want to say yes, I need some painting done.  Please do.  Yeah.  Help me.  Maybe he'll come in and help you out.  Hey, how you been?  Sometimes I'm just wandering around on the floor.  I'm like, will you just fucking go in your stupid apartment?  Is he an old guy?  Yeah.  He doesn't come around often, so it's like a second place for him, I guess.  Oh, so he's probably just out of it. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's a dick.  Yeah.  It's hard to fucking find a nice group of people you live next to.  Yeah, man.  I have a buddy of mine who moved into a house in Oregon, and they fucking poisoned his dog.  Someone in the neighborhood poisoned his dog.  He doesn't know who it was, but his dog just moved there from California.  You know, the dog's barking and shit.  That's what dogs do.  What the fuck am I doing here?  Ruff, ruff.  So someone gave him poisoned fucking dog food, man.  Wow.  That's brutal.  Welcome to the neighborhood.  I killed your dog.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  He's saying you find out who did it. 
[01:37:00]  Find out who's working the day shift.  Or the night shift.  Find out who's working the night shift and sleeps during the day.  Right.  Because that will drive you nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should, we got a break just because of live reads.  Sam's panicking.  Joe's going to hang out for me.  What happened to satellite radio?  I know, right?  Didn't satellite radio have no commercials at one point in time?  Wasn't that why you were paying for it?  Yeah.  What the fuck happened?  Now they say, well, the music channels.  They slowly start to sneak them in.  They're like, well, the music channels don't have it, but the talk channels.  Why does the talk channel have to have it?  You would think that it'd be.  They say it's so it gives us a chance to take a break. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  Do you need a break?  Just babbling.  Do you need a break so they can make some more money?  A break that I'm fucking talking.  Right.  So listen, Joe's going to be here for another 15, 20 minutes.  Let's not forget Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 on NBC.  It looks so fucking cool.  We're psyched it's bad.  I wish I could show you the video.  I don't have it on this fucking phone.  Okay, tell us the one episode that.  I'll tell you as soon as we get off the air.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  Go to break.  Series XM.  The Opie Reactor Show. 
[01:38:00]  Exactly.  I'm in a bad mood.  I'm just telling Joe Rogan.  I fucking hate Twitter because people like turn me on to shit I don't want to know about.  And someone just retweeted a tweet from Kim Kardashian.  She had a life-changing experience in New York City. 
[01:38:30]  The life-changing experience was a reading from that fucking hack John Edwards.  Oh, really?  You don't believe John Edwards.  Please, Joe.  Please.  The only psychic phenomenon I believe in is the ones that we can't control or the rare instances  where someone knows something's going to happen right before it happens.  I believe in some psychic fucking abilities, but John Edwards is a hack that's just making  money off people.  Do you, Anthony?  I don't know.  I'd like to...  There's no evidence.  That's unfortunate. 
[01:39:00]  I know.  That's just it.  No evidence with all these people.  I'd like to be able to, you know, move a matchstick or something like that.  Bend my mind.  It'd be so cool.  Bend that spoon.  We've talked about John Edwards a lot on this show.  Not a spoon.  And we've had people on.  It's like...  There's no spoon.  He's got fucking microphones.  He's fucking...  He's using all the tricks in the...  Yeah.  Oh, Penn Jillette.  Penn Jillette fucking destroyed him on our show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Explaining how it's done.  Well, there is psychic...  Because you want to believe, so, you know, you lead the person on, like, I'm thinking  of this relative, and you give up the answers for the person. 
[01:39:30]  There is psychic shit that they can measure, like, whether or not someone's...  Someone knowing that someone's looking at them, that's actually measurable.  Oh.  They've actually proven that, that people can...  Statistically, that there's numbers that show that people can actually tell when people  are looking at them.  Right.  That is a weird feeling that you get.  Yeah.  Well, what the fuck is that?  That's an instinctive nature, so you're going to get attacked by something, you can  feel you're being looked at.  Yeah.  But how's that even happening?  Yeah.  Where does that come from?  There's a reason, there's a guy, fuck, what is it, Sheldrake, Robert Sheldrake? 
[01:40:00]  No, I forget his name.  There's Sheldrake...  Shit, I forget his full name.  You got everything else right today.  He's got a theory called the morphic resonance field, and the idea is that there's, like,  there's some sort of a field that connects everyone together, and that's why dogs know  when their owners are coming home, Rupert Sheldrake, and that's how dogs know, like, in advance. 
[01:40:30]  Like, that's also provable.  Like, you could put, like, cameras on dogs, and, like, the owner will be, like...  Oh, they freak out, yeah.  Yeah, long before.  Dude, weird times in the day, the owner will be on his way home, and the dog will, like,  perk up, you know?  Could it be chemical more so than electrical?  Yeah.  It could be all of the above.  Like, even somebody looking at you, perhaps, you know, there's some kind of a chemical  reaction that your body picks up without, you know, without smelling it, or...  You know, twins always say, all twins say this, that they can sense when their twin is  in danger, and then they know when their twin is hurt. 
[01:41:00]  How the fuck do they do that?  What is that?  Yeah, that is weird.  And maybe that's just a more extreme version of some sort of a connection that we all share.  Right.  It's probably something that's evolving.  You know, if you think about human language, human language doesn't exist.  And the form that we can communicate in, as far as we know, we know that dolphins have  ways of communicating, and orcas do.  We can't see the evidence of how far they can take it, because they're not able to manipulate  their environment and change their world visibly like we can.  They don't have thumbs and shit.  But what we can do is, you know, a fairly recent discovery. 
[01:41:30]  It's only been around for about 40,000 or 50,000 years.  And the idea that we can do this is a fairly new thing.  It's a new beast.  It's the idea that we can communicate with our mouths.  And essentially, you're reading, we're reading each other's minds.  You're able to relay all your thoughts, you know, about anything, you know, that's what  Vibrating air.  Yeah, through air.  Well, you know, how do we not know that there are a bunch of other senses that are slowly  coming out of the, you know, the amoebic form, they're slowly coming out of the embryonic 
[01:42:00]  form, and that they're going to eventually become a part of our everyday life, these senses  and these abilities to communicate?  Yeah, maybe what picks up the other senses can pick up other things.  You know, our ears, right now, they're made for sound.  Yeah.  You pick it up.  But perhaps they can do another thing that we don't quite know of yet or haven't really  developed yet.  Yeah, there's all sorts of weird, I mean, look, appendixes.  This used to be a fucking thing there to process certain types of foods that we don't eat anymore. 
[01:42:30]  There was an organ, and it slowly shrank away, you know?  What did it process?  Just drying up.  I thought it was raw meat, but then I've been told that that's not true, that it's actually  like certain plants and fibrous plants, like before we cooked plants, that people had to  be able to eat some, break down some shit.  I haven't really looked into it.  You want to look into it?  It just sits there and gets all fucked up on some people.  Whatever it is.  Our diets evolved and changed, and we don't need that anymore.  You could take that out.  You could take the spleen out, right, for the most part.  I mean, look at our fucking bodies. 
[01:43:00]  At one point in time, we had to be able to exist outside in the cold and shit, you know?  We were hairier, whatever the fuck we were.  We were more monkey-like, you know?  At one point in time, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Something had to change to slowly become us, you know?  It's a real mindfuck.  It really is.  It really is.  You really wrapped your head around it.  Can you imagine if you could peer into what human life is going to be like one million years  from now?  A million years.  That's a good one, yeah. 
[01:43:30]  If you could just, like, look forward, you know, they give you a virtual reality goggles  and you, you know, you pop forward one million years and take a quick peek.  Maybe if they could figure it out on a computer.  Maybe a computer could extrapolate probabilities, take out natural disasters, and say, okay,  with the current extent of evolution and technological innovation, where are we in one million years?  How about the next hundred?  The next hundred's going to be nuts.  The next year's going to be nuts, man.  That would even be cool to know the next hundred.  I mean, this is the big theory, is that technology increases at an exponential pace. 
[01:44:00]  Well, that's right.  It's Ray Kurzweil.  Yeah, Ray Kurzweil.  We had him in, by the way.  What a bore.  Was he a bore?  He's got great theories, but he's a bore.  He's a bore.  Yeah.  And his documentary was, like, slow as shit.  Well, it's cool because they cut in and out of him, and they have a bunch of other people  dissenting points of view.  His thoughts and his theories are fascinating.  I think his time frame is off, though.  He thinks 40 years, and I think that's wishful thinking on his part because he's in his 50s.  But I think that his time frame from singularity is off.  Some people think it's even sooner than that. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, McKenna thought that it was going to happen so much quicker than anybody could ever  imagine because of the fact that...  Can you explain that for the people that didn't hear the Ray Kurzweil on our show?  Well, the idea is that, you know, what it means by an exponential increase is that it's  not like 1 plus 1 is 2 and 2 plus 2.  It's every year it gets faster and faster and faster, and with every new piece of technology,  more new pieces of technology, more new innovations are built forth on that foundation, and it  eventually gets to a point when... 
[01:45:00]  The way McKenna described it is a fascinating way.  He said it's like, think of a funnel, and at the top of the funnel, there's a large  mouth, and if you spun a marble around the funnel, at the top of the funnel, it'll take  a long time for the funnel to go in a full circle, but as it gets to the bottom, it's  going faster and faster and faster and faster and faster, and it will continue to do that,  and the funnel will continue to get smaller to the point where more information is stored  and shared in a moment than in the entire record of human history, and that's where we 
[01:45:30]  are now.  You know, there's some sort of a statistic about data use, and the statistic said something  like, up until like 1980, human beings used X amount of gigabytes of data.  Well, now they use that every two hours.  Yeah.  Whatever people accumulated from the beginning of human language and 40,000 years of culture  all the way up to like 1980, we do that every couple hours.  When you think about how much of a pain in the ass it was to not know something, and what 
[01:46:00]  you had to go through to then learn it, it sucked.  You either needed encyclopedias in your house that had the answer to what you were looking  for, or you had to go to a library, or it just wasn't right at your fingertips, or God forbid  you couldn't remember an actor's name.  You'd be there, like, for hours, just going, God, it's right there at the tip of my tongue.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now, boom, IMDB, bam, you're there.  You didn't even have to type it. 
[01:46:30]  You just talk it in your phone now.  Yeah, now you just talk it into Siri or something.  Or Google Voice.  It's Google Voice.  You know, the Google, Google, um, and eventually we'll just think it.  The little microphone button on the Google thing.  Yeah, it's just like, well, thank you.  But it sucked back then.  You just went around not knowing shit.  And people could bullshit you.  Remember the goddamn conversations you'd get in?  Do you wear the Illuminati as set up?  Fort Knox is underneath the White House.  There's nine million pounds of gold.  Like, what?  That's hilarious.  Yeah, you could. 
[01:47:00]  Remember those stories?  People could bullshit you, and you really had no recourse.  You're just like, I think you're lying, yeah?  Well, that's how, like, all the best, you know, theories and conspiracy theories got  for, like, with UFOs and fucking Roswell.  They were basically like Bible stories.  They were just told, you know?  They were passed on in verbal form over the years before anybody ever put it on Wikipedia.  Yeah.  You know?  It took a long time before anybody wrote down all that information.  I got Charles in Santa Cruz with something for you, Joe. 
[01:47:30]  Charles, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, look what happened to Hitler.  He brainwashed all those guys without the information.  Anyway, there was this kid in the 20s that was deaf, and they started noticing that he  was able to react to them, like, 10 years later.  So, finally, the kid died.  So, they opened up his head, and they found out that he was throwing a little piece of  bone in the back of his head that was picking up the vibration.  So, he was adapting somehow to hear.  And that was a trip.  I don't know.  What the hell? 
[01:48:00]  Is this true, Joe?  Where can we look this shit up?  You're not going to bullshit us today.  In the 20s?  It's not the 80s.  What?  Yeah, what do you think?  How do we look this up?  Look it up.  Look it up.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  So, what?  He was growing a fucking bone in his brain to hear?  Yeah.  He was...  Oh, shit.  I've never heard this before.  Yeah.  That's fascinating.  But how would a bone make you hear?  Yeah.  Picture of the vibrations, I guess.  Yeah, Charles.  And now he hung up.  Floats?  I panicked.  Ah, what are you going to do now? 
[01:48:30]  Freaked out.  He's beating off right now.  Freaked out.  The guy probably could hear all along.  He was just faking.  He just panicked.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah.  It's odd shit.  Odd shit.  Mm-hmm.  Just the ability to hear is odd in itself.  You know, the fact that sound waves.  You know, when you hear something like...  You know, I have one-and-a-half-year-olds, my youngest daughter, and I watch her wander around  the house, and a noise will come, and she hasn't really figured out where noises are coming  from yet.  And, you know, I've observed that.  Like, she'll...  Like, I'll say... 
[01:49:00]  I go, Rosie!  Rosie!  And she, like, looks around, and she kind of eventually tunes into where...  You know, but when they're one-and-a-half, they have these giant fucking heads, and they  could barely run.  You know, they run, they have to slow down because their head's too big.  And when you yell at them, they don't...  Like, my three-year-old, I go, what are you doing over there?  And she turns around and looks right at me.  She knows exactly where the sound is coming from.  She's pinpointed it.  But it's kind of a fascinating thing that we can pinpoint sound.  Yeah.  You know, and you're really fucking good at it, you know?  That's the two ears.  You hear, like, a rat in your walls or something, like, shut the fuck up, shut up, shut up. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  This motherfucker, where is he?  And you kind of turn your head around a little bit.  And the thought that, you know, you're using your both ears, and it's invisible, and then  it's got to work its magic in your fucking goopy gray stuff that's your brain, to let  you know that it's coming from that direction, and then move the muscles toward that direction.  Like, it's just a whole cavalcade of weirdness going on.  Processes, yeah.  Processes and things that just...  And that's just one small thing.  Sight is another thing that's just fucked up. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, crazy.  When you think about eyeballs and optic nerves.  How the fuck are you changing a picture into some fucking thing that can then go into  my goopy brain thing, and I could then see it?  And you see it so well that you could be on the highway, switching lanes at 80 miles an  hour, just dodging bumpers left and right like an asshole.  I mean, think about the trust that you have, and you're a bitty, the refracting lenses,  and light, and distance, and you're fucking stomping on the gas. 
[01:50:30]  Yep.  You know?  You know, I was thinking of this, too.  You ever try to do anything in a mirror to yourself, you know?  You've got to reach around, and you're all awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you're driving, your mirrors are just like, ugh, right?  I know exactly what that is.  I used to have a van.  I used to deliver newspapers, and I had a van with no windows.  A big West Coast mirror.  It had no windows.  Yeah, yeah.  And I bought it for 500 bucks just for delivering newspapers.  And I would drive this motherfucker.  I knew how to parallel park with that bitch.  It's everything.  Work those mirrors, man.  Two side mirrors.  That's it.  I'd back a trailer into a ramp down at the water to get my jet ski in there and stuff. 
[01:51:00]  And yeah, you wind up just figuring it out.  Yeah.  Two seconds.  Wham back in.  Well, you know, you're a gamer.  Yeah.  And you, like myself, like the mouse and keyboard setup.  Way more precise.  But you remember when you first started using it, and you couldn't figure out where the  fuck your guy was spinning?  Yeah, yeah.  You had to think about it.  If you have to think about what you're doing, you're fucked.  You're fucked.  It becomes second nature where you're walking sideways when you come by a hall, and then 
[01:51:30]  you spin around the other way.  And you're not thinking, like, what keys do I have to hit to spin around?  You're just going like this.  It's becoming an extension of you.  You're just, well, all right, back, that way, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  W-A-S-D going for forward, back, side to side.  Yeah, you're just kicking ass.  And the mouse, it becomes a, it really reacts to your brain, you know?  It becomes an extension of your eyes.  It's so fucked up.  It's just so weird how that shit works.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  It's amazing, and it's probably only the beginning. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever the fuck we're going to be.  Yeah, 100%, right?  Absolutely.  You know, that's why I get angry when people want to, like, save things.  We saved the Komodo dragon.  No, we didn't just save anything.  90% of everything that's ever existed is fucking dead, all right?  And we're going to be dead, too.  And if we're not dead, guess what?  We're going to be like this forever.  We're never going to evolve.  We're going to be this retard monkey with nuclear bombs forever.  This is going to be us.  No, we're going to have to become something better and greater than this eventually.  You know, if we came out of the primordial slime, and we were single-celled organisms, 
[01:52:30]  and we eventually became people who make rocket ships, for sure, that trend's going to keep going.  Yeah, it's not just going to stop.  You've got to keep evolving.  Yeah, so fuck the Komodo dragon.  The Komodo dragon can suck my dick.  Take a picture of it, store it in a file, and we'll get back to it.  Yeah, and then kill all those baby-making freaks.  We'll make new ones eventually.  We are just, we're very short-sighted, and we think much too much of ourselves as individuals  to think like, you know, well, we have to save the planet. 
[01:53:00]  It's like, in the little speck of time you're here, it's nothing.  You're not going to do anything to this dumbass planet.  And it probably has wiped out complete civilizations and entire populations of the planet time and time again.  So it's like, no, you better worry about just saving yourself, having some fun.  Well, that's what save the planet is.  It is save ourselves.  We're not caring about the planet itself.  No one's trying to stop rocks from hitting the moon.  It's just about, we have to make the environment more livable for ourselves.  Because we're all concerned with things that are going to affect us. 
[01:53:30]  Like, no one thinks that stuff is going to fly off the earth.  We're trying to make the environment more livable for us.  Yeah, but you've got a great guilt issue.  We have a guilt issue.  We like the spotted owl.  Oh, we lost the owl.  The spotted, the dodo bird is gone.  Human beings, the Tasmanian tiger, wherefore art thou?  You know, fuck them, man.  They're all going to go.  And guess what?  We need to be more concentrating on the fucking rainforest and the ocean.  The oceans are polluted and we're sucking all the fish out of it.  And there's a giant Texas-sized patch of floating plastic in the middle of it. 
[01:54:00]  And it gets bigger every fucking day.  Is that true?  Fuck yeah, it's true.  Some people say it's not true.  Fuck yeah, it's true.  It's got to be true, right?  100britvice.com.  That guy was on my podcast on Tuesday.  Shane Smith said that they went out there.  Fuck yeah, they do.  They don't have pictures.  They have video of it.  They have footage.  Can we see this video?  Yeah, 100%.  The garbage patch is fucking huge.  It's giant.  And it's not stopping.  Not only that, there's several garbage patches.  There's an Atlantic garbage patch.  There's a Pacific garbage patch.  There's a couple garbage patches all over the world.  That's fucking deep, right?  Just all the shit that are...  We have these currents, these natural currents that the water flows in. 
[01:54:30]  And these natural currents just automatically pool this fucking shit that we throw up.  It all comes into one big pile.  I want to see the video.  And it's enormous.  We're just so disgusting.  We really are.  Think about it.  Yeah, yeah.  We go into the water.  We pull all the fish out.  Kill the fuck out of them.  And then poison whatever's left.  Whatever's left, yeah.  Throw our nuclear waste in the water.  But you know what?  We'll just fuck ourselves up.  And then in time, the Earth will just be this pristine, nice place again. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, we'll be gone.  The thought that we could ever do permanent damage to this planet is really kind of silly.  The amazing thing, though, is how quickly we did the damage.  We've done the damage through the Industrial Age.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Before that, nothing.  We didn't do fucking shit.  Go back to the cowboy and Indians days.  Yeah, yeah.  What'd you do?  You made a campfire?  Get that campfire?  That effect in the fucking ozone layer?  No, we had no effect.  So essentially in 200 years, we've completely changed the surface of the Earth and our impact on it. 
[01:55:30]  Like, all of a sudden, we've become toxic.  It's like we were in gestation period, and we got to a certain point in time, like AIDS.  You know, all of a sudden, we decided to come out.  You know, and boom!  Yeah, there was an incubation period, and then we just started fucking shit up.  Yeah, for a million years, Earth is like, yeah, I got herpes, but it's no big deal.  Yeah, I got people, but it doesn't even flare up.  And then one day, the Earth's immune system got a little low.  People got fucking badass.  We invented nuclear weapons and garbage, and then boom. 
[01:56:00]  Now the Earth is sick as fuck.  Now the Earth is a serious case of human herpes.  It kind of was necessary, though.  I mean, I don't think we have the ability to make some of the great shit we can make without leaving a lot of waste and garbage and poison.  It's just we do it so quickly.  It's what it is is, you know, our rational minds haven't caught up with what we're capable of doing.  We haven't really, like, planned it all out.  We're just doing whatever we can do while we can do it.  Yeah, I just find it astounding that, you know, you just pull things out of the Earth and manipulate them with heat and other chemicals, and then you make things that fly. 
[01:56:30]  To me, that's astounding.  Well, what's even more astounding is all this comes out of the imagination.  We pull all this from the ether.  So from the ether, this one thing has these ideas.  Like, the ideas are out there in the ether, and there's this thing, this animal that's like a little antenna, tunes into these ideas and then manifests in the physical world.  Now you've got to make it work with what's around you.  Yeah, metals and rocks and melts stuff down and creates these things, and these things build on to other things that other fucking monkeys create. 
[01:57:00]  And next thing you know, they've got a large hadron collider that's making black holes.  It's like, hey, I want to travel like 3,000 miles an hour.  I've got to build something.  All right, let me take some of this rock, some water, some of this shit, and then you mix it all together, and you're fucking propelling your ass at, you know, a few times the speed of sound.  It really is fucked up.  Like, for how fragile our bodies are that we were talking earlier, the mind is kind of, that is like an unlimited thing that we really haven't hit the wall with yet. 
[01:57:30]  Not even close.  It's not even close.  And the experiments that we're having now are so far above and beyond anything anybody's ever done in the past.  Like all the large hadron collider shit, where they, you know, they found that they've managed to create this quark gluon plasma that is so, I think it's 400 billion or 40 billion tons for a sugar cube of it. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, shit.  A sugar cube of it.  And they've managed to create particles of this stuff.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  It's like neutron star stuff.  Yeah.  No, it's more dense.  It's more dense than a neutron star.  And they've created it.  The E-rock.  Yeah.  The E-rock.  We've got to get Joe out of here.  I've got to hang out with Al Roker in an hour.  That's a little different than what we've been doing.  Great.  Back to dick jokes.  It's going to suck.  I know.  Back to dick jokes.  Back to shitty shit.  Fear Factor starting Monday at 8 on NBC.  We're all looking forward to this. 
[01:58:30]  This show should have never went away.  I guess.  I was happy it went away.  You needed the break.  Yeah, I wanted a break.  But I enjoyed doing it again.  It's all about having the right mixture in me when I do it.  I was going to say something.  I was going to say something earlier.  I forgot.  The trailers that I've been watching for the show, it looks, not so much the eating and  disgusting thing, but I'm seeing people physically being fucked with in ways that, like there's  a person, they're right in front of you, bah, they're 300 yards away. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, you see that bungee cord thing?  What the fuck happens?  That bungee cord thing in a helicopter was one of the nuttiest ones we ever did.  It's insane.  We had these people.  One person was attached to a tree, and the other person had to free them.  And they're connected by all these fucking chains and shit.  And when the person undoes the last thing, they get launched through the fucking air.  I mean, launched like 600 feet in a matter of a couple of seconds.  It was crazy. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  And then, you know, they're suspended over this giant rock quarry.  It was really nuts.  That helicopter shit and just...  Have you tried any of this shit?  No.  They don't allow me to do any of those things.  You're not allowed to try it out?  No, because it would have to be, you know, I would have to be insured for it.  Crazy.  Look at this shit.  They're just catapulting people.  That's amazing.  And the moving vehicles and the crashes.  It was way bigger and crazier this year.  The best way to describe it is that if you look at the old Fear Factor, like, look at  that.  Oh, man.  The old Fear Factor, we had an A, B, and a C stunt. 
[02:00:00]  So the A stunt was like the first thing, and the B was like the disgusting eating thing.  And then C is like, you know, the grand finale.  Well, the A stunts on the new show are way bigger than the grand finales on the old show.  So it's fucking way over the top.  Yeah.  I mean, we went deep, dude.  You saw that?  Jerry's like, no fucking way.  Just get propelled out of a window.  It was really weird to do, man.  Because, like, Matt Cunett said it best.  It was like, we went into a coma for six years, and then we came out and did the show again. 
[02:00:30]  You're clean shaven on this, too.  You look different than you do on UFC.  See, they want me to shave for some reason.  I don't understand that.  Just to make it a different look.  So America loves you.  Gentlemen.  They want America to fall in love with Joe Rogan.  This is collegiate Joe.  Yeah, yeah.  They all know me right now, I think.  Wow, it's a fucking fire.  I know, the explosions.  This just looks great, man.  Ah, we're happy for you, Joe.  Yeah, that's my buddy David Hurwitz.  He's the one who got me the job in the first place.  You know, when I was first doing Fear Factor, when I came in for the audition, I was making 
[02:01:00]  fun of everything, and they didn't want to hire me because of that.  They're like, we can't have this guy.  He's going to make fun of everything on the set.  We want this to be scary.  And then Hurwitz was like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Look what we're doing.  We're supposed to be making fun of this guy.  If we're not making fun of it, other people are going to be making fun of it for us.  Right.  You know?  Wow.  What was that are you holding?  A big bang?  A giant thing is Madagascar hissing cockroaches.  Oh, the famous hissing cockroaches.  Did you find anything new to eat?  Yeah, yeah, we did.  Stuff that I was telling you about?  Yeah.  We won't get into that, but wow. 
[02:01:30]  Anything else, though?  No, I think it's all along the same lines.  It's just they made people do things.  It wasn't just eat this.  It's like, you know, you've got to play horseshoes, and then, you know, whatever the distance is.  Then everything became a game.  You know, it was much better thought out.  And, you know, you've got to realize that stunt technology is really advanced.  And on top of that, that guy right there, Matt Kunitz, he's the executive producer of it.  Great guy.  And Matt also runs Wipeout, and he runs 1,101 Ways to Leave a Game Show. 
[02:02:00]  Remember that show?  Sure.  He does that as well.  So, you know, they have so much experience with stunts and with producing and creating stunts for TV shows.  Oh, holy shit.  This is crazy.  We're just watching the trailers.  It's way over the top.  It's so much.  It's hard to remember.  The other show was nuts, but this show, as nutty as the other show was for the time, for 2001,  this is just as nutty for 2011.  Is that how long ago that was on?  2001, yeah.  Holy shit.  Till when?  Till six.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:30]  And then we were off for five and a half plus years.  And then all of a sudden, we're back.  It's very strange, man.  It was like really like the first day was surreal as fuck.  Like it didn't even seem real.  But then the second day, it was just, oh, I'm going to work again.  Yeah, it felt like you'd just never left.  Yeah.  How long did it take you to shoot?  One episode.  For three stunt episodes, it's three days.  And for a five stunt episode, obviously, it's five days.  Those are for the two.  How cool are helicopters?  Pretty fucking awesome.  Fuck yeah.  We have these badass helicopter pilots, too, that can fly side by side. 
[02:03:00]  So there's the wings.  Like one guy will go up and another guy will go below and they'll move around like that.  But if they go like this, tink.  Yeah, the rotor's hit and everyone dies.  Great.  But they managed to not do that.  Shit.  Always.  That's for the camera work, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, obviously, we have to be really careful and not do that anywhere near gusts  of wind.  And that was a big stunt.  We had people drive a truck into an ammo dump.  They were attached to helicopters by these giant cords. 
[02:03:30]  And they had to run and then jump into the back of a remote-controlled truck.  And as the remote-controlled truck is bashing through these barriers one after another,  it's headed towards this giant ammo dump.  And at the last second, the helicopter pulls them out of the truck.  The truck keeps going.  Boom!  Hits this ammo dump.  And when I say the explosion was fucking intense, I mean, we were seven, eight football fields  away and my clothes moved.  It went poof.  Like poof.  Like you felt it.  You felt it from like 700 fucking yards away. 
[02:04:00]  It was insane.  That's crazy, man.  It lit up the sky.  I mean, it was just like way crazier than any shit we ever did before.  And we can't do eggnog drinking challenge anymore.  You guys need to just go straight internet.  Yeah, no shit.  At a certain point in time.  I'm pretty much heading that way.  I hear you, man.  It's pretty obvious to everyone.  What are we looking at?  December 12th?  Monday, December 12th?  Yeah, Monday, December 12th.  It's coming Monday, Ann.  8 p.m.  7 central.  8 p.m. on NBC.  Can't fucking wait, man.  With that, we got to get Joe out of here.  He's got to talk to Al Roker. 
[02:04:30]  Well, thank you, boys, for having me on.  Joe, thanks so much, man.  It's a pleasure to have my podcast on your network.  It's an honor.  I really appreciate that.  We love it.  Having me on your channel.  It's cool as fuck.  We fucking love it.  Joe Rogan on Twitter, of course, too.  And UFC this weekend.  Of course.  Yeah, John Jones.  We didn't even get a chance to talk about that.  It's going to be a great one.  Fucking out, Roker.  All right.  Joe, we'll see you soon.  God damn it.  Joe Rogan.  No!  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  What we have here is the best of both worlds. 
[02:05:00]  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer.  Onboard memory.  And 30 years of human experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust.  Protect the innocent.  Uphold the law.  And to jerk off in a toilet, all right?  Part man.  Part robot.  Complete imbecile.  Alive or dead.  Dead or alive.  You're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid. 
[02:05:30]  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Can I need it?  Please respond.  We have a 16-3 in progress.  All right, let's go, Mr. Mamoon again.  Bobo Cop.  Who is he? 
[02:06:00]  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  Bobo Cop.  Bobo Cop.  Any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, all right, you got to wear a condom when you go to sleep because you don't want  to jizz in your pants when you, when you're-  Bobo Cop!  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, I mean, uh, stay out of trouble.  Bobo Cop.  Bobo Cop. 
[02:06:30]  Bobo Cop.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  I remember when I met you.  You noticed me.  Me, me, me, me.  Me.  Hurting me.  Pain me. 
[02:07:00]  Say it.  Say it about me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me, me, me. 
[02:07:30]  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:00]  Once again, I want to thank Joe Rogan for stopping by.  Joe's cool, man.  Fucking love the guy.  I'll tell you this much, too.  I just talked to him for like 10 minutes in the hall.  That fucking guy is so loyal, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking just, fucking just so appreciative, man.  And I'm sitting there like, what, are you kidding me?  It was fun just listening to you for two hours. 
[02:08:30]  You know?  Yeah.  He blows your mind.  Yeah.  He blows your fucking brain right up.  Those deep conversations.  I like that shit.  Yeah, I like that shit.  I like some of that shit.  Because now we're just going to talk about Sandusky and other horse shit.  Although, what?  We got Anthony Bourdain coming in, right?  I got to tell you, I love the concept of this new show, Sam.  Do you?  Yeah, I really do.  Why are you laughing?  What?  What?  I love the concept.  Good.  It's a terrific concept. 
[02:09:00]  Do you want to explain it to the people out there?  The show's called Layover, or The Layover.  It's on a travel channel.  Right.  And the idea is that you're in a city.  Yeah.  And you have a layover for like 24 to 48 hours.  And you sample the city, the culture, and the food, and the...  You know, when I fly to Buffalo every once in a while,  I just love that 48-hour layover I get.  Yeah, a layover.  Just amazing.  You know, when I'm going to L.A.,  sometimes I'll get a layover in like Chicago.  For 48 hours, right?  Yeah, 48 hours.  And all of a sudden, you're like just on the street, 
[02:09:30]  just checking out the culture.  Oh, getting some deep dish pizza.  Because you got a two-day layover as you go to L.A.  Fucking love that shit.  Sometimes you have a...  Why don't layovers like six hours or something, if it's a long one?  Are they stretching the whole layover concept with this show?  Let's be honest with each other.  It's not really a layover, is it?  I hear the show's funny and it's good, but...  It's a great show.  I watched it last night.  You guys also probably should have,  since you'll be doing the interview, but...  I was...  I know, but I didn't have time.  What were you doing?  That's rolling, by the way.  I know. 
[02:10:00]  I know.  I know.  I know.  I'll tell you what I was doing.  I told Rogan and I fucking cracked him up.  I went to see my mommy yesterday.  My mommy invited me to her Christmas party,  which happens to be in an assisted living facility, Sam.  Okay.  And I'm hanging out with my 75-year-old mom,  with my son and a couple siblings.  And then my mom decided to announce that she's attracted to someone at the home.  Oh.  Oh.  Now, my mom's 75. 
[02:10:30]  But that sounds pleasant, at least.  The guy that she's attracted to, she goes, he's a little older.  But I'm thinking, you're 75, so what is...  It's not Scatman Crothers teaching her to kick the can, is it?  So I'm like, a little older than 75.  I'll accept 80.  How old?  92.  She's attracted to a 92-year-old man?  She's attracted to a 92-year-old, and she goes, he has a nice...  She tells me, her son, that he has a nice body and has all his teeth. 
[02:11:00]  A nice body?  At 92!  She's probably noticed his bulge, because what else?  On the body, it's not like he's muscular anymore.  Norton just arrived.  My mom admitted to me yesterday, because I went to her Christmas party at her assisted living facility,  that she's attracted to a 92-year-old that has a nice body and has all his teeth.  I'm sitting there like 75.  The guy likes older men.  He's got to be packing, too.  92, though.  He probably is.  You know this?  He probably walks around in his PJs and his big dick flops out.  That's what it is. 
[02:11:30]  Accidentally?  Like, he doesn't know what's happening.  He's got dementia.  Yeah.  And he starts whacking off in the hallway, and all the ladies are like, ooh, he's crazy,  but what a big dick.  Oh, and he's wearing shorts.  His ball bag is just hanging out like melting Turkish taffy.  They have a dementia wing at this place.  We were not allowed to go into that.  That's got to be a fun wing.  That closed-in area.  It's like a fucking prison, because those people will wander.  Just tell them you're their grandchildren, and then take money from them.  There you go.  But they had a bar set up last night, and I'm watching 90-year-old guys drinking fucking beers.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah. 
[02:12:00]  The elderly are living a little better these days.  Would you be freaked out if your mom got pregnant?  Oh, God.  How is that possible?  Jesus.  But do you think she's going to bang him?  Oh, my God.  You think?  That's a fair question.  Yeah, of course it is.  You're crossing the line, Sam.  Yeah, what's her pubic hairstyle?  Sam's crossing the line.  Sam is crossing the fucking line.  Wow.  Do you think she would, though?  Would my mom have sex?  And do you think it would start with straight sex, or what do you think it would do first?  Because she likes his body.  It's a physical attraction.  She does like his body.  Heavy kissing.  It's physical at this point.  She would do some heavy petting. 
[02:12:30]  Heavy petting.  He would get to feel her uterus outside her body.  Oh, God.  Because she did have six kids.  Would there be, like, deep tongue kissing to start?  Probably, yeah.  Like, that's kind of approaching second base.  So this is how you handle this, Sam.  Well, I think it's a fair, a legit question.  Yeah, yeah, it'll look fine.  I want to know if you're challenging you.  Would there be head?  You run in the corner and cry like a little bitch when we talk to your mom.  I'm always here.  Oh.  And part of the conversation.  But she's attracted to a 92-year-old with a nice body. 
[02:13:00]  What the fuck is that?  How many dates before she blew him?  Probably the first date at that age.  No more waiting.  How much time do I have?  Yeah, exactly.  Why would you wait?  Why would you wait at that age?  Exactly.  He's eating his Jell-O all of a sudden.  Oh, that's lovely.  Get right into ass play.  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, nothing to wait for.  Just comes dust into her mouth.  Oh.  Wow.  Sick.  You know the other end of this, right?  Oh, yeah.  So enjoy.  Because next time your mom's on the fucking phone, trust me, the payback will begin.  And this will be written in my notebook. 
[02:13:30]  You have a notebook?  I will not forget this one.  No.  I don't have a notebook.  Exactly.  This isn't payback.  How can you give me payback when you've already done worse to my mom?  Oh, you watch.  Oh.  I didn't realize we were going this deep with this shit.  Why?  You watch what happens next.  Oh, cool.  You watch.  Cool meaning we can go home soon, right?  No, no, no.  Yeah.  I saw your face.  No, I saw that we have Anthony Bourdain in 15 minutes.  I'm just making sure he's a guest that we're still allowed to get on this show.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  Good.  Oh.  What happened?  Nothing.  Well.  Nothing.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Now we need to know, Jimmy.  No, no.  I'm just still doing some investigating.  Yes.  Now we need to know.  I am not letting this one go.  No, you're just talking about old people fucking investigative journalism.  There's some rumors floating around out there.  Yeah.  We're trying to get to the bottom.  And nobody ever owns up to saying, I said this or I said that.  Nope.  Nobody ever does.  Nope.  And I'm not going to let it go.  Wow.  You can't.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you, the old folk, they're living pretty good, man. 
[02:14:30]  Are they?  I think so.  Some of them.  There was some guy, he had to be 100, walking the hallways in a blue suit.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Because he was talking about, he was talking clear as day.  So it wasn't like some fucking, like he, basically he said that you could still be a pilot at 100 years old as long as you're past the physical.  Wow.  You're still allowed to fly at 100.  Well, they said.  And I don't know if that means he's still like, uh, you know, getting, getting off the grounds and going up or not.  I don't know. 
[02:15:00]  But he knows a lot about aviation.  He said, yeah, you're still allowed to fly at 100.  Did he fly in the big war?  There's no age restriction.  Oh, yeah.  They have all the, uh, the war guy's, uh, photos on the walls.  Oh, yeah.  They respect the war guy's big fucking time.  Did he seem like a guy that you would trust to fly?  Like, was he all there?  What are you getting at, Sam?  I'm not getting at anything.  I'm asking a question in the comment.  Mile high club for my mom?  Is that what you're getting at?  Well, I'm not.  I mean, that guy was flying the plane.  I'm assuming your mom and her crush would, uh, would get on the plane, maybe. 
[02:15:30]  I didn't get to see, uh, the crush.  Would you call him dad?  That's pretty funny.  Would you hug him when you saw him?  I could use a stepfather of my life, I guess.  Never too late.  Anthony Bourdain, uh, the layover on the Travel Channel, Mondays at 9.  So, he gets to layover two days, even though most of us lay over for an hour or two.  Yeah.  That's so cool that we're getting him on the show.  I'm so happy that, uh, we're, we're cool to have him. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus.  That's great.  It's becoming more obvious.  No, I love that.  Like, sometimes we're not allowed to have certain people on our show?  Yeah, I'll say it.  Michael C. Hall, there was an issue today, I guess, but I'm really happy.  Today?  Uh, he's here today.  And we're not allowed to have him on?  No.  Why?  I don't know.  I'd be interested to find out.  Someone's saying we're not allowed to have him?  Um, not necessarily, in theory, allowed to, but, you know.  This is publicist?  Who's being spoken to about this? 
[02:16:30]  That's what I want to know.  I talked to Gary, we're going to talk to Blatter, and we're working on it, but, um, just wanted  that out there in this.  They're voluntarily going to talk to them?  I want to, I want to, I want to thank.  It's unacceptable what's happening.  I would never.  Unacceptable.  Well, I want to thank Steve Blatter and Gary and Rob for, uh, making an appearance at  Patrice O'Neal's memorial.  That was so, oh, that's right, they didn't go.  Oh, that's right, they didn't go.  I will, on that, say that there's something happening, that the company is doing something  that's very much the right thing. 
[02:17:00]  Something.  I'll tell you what it is once it happens, but there is something they're doing.  The right thing is you go and make an appearance.  I agree.  The guy was a massive force for this channel.  I agree.  We're going to downplay this.  This fucking, Patrice was like, was the next guy.  Look, I think they sent flowers.  I don't, or did they?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I'm assuming that they would.  I don't understand why they wouldn't represent, the company wouldn't represent.  That bothers me, man.  A lot.  To be honest with you, I'll tell you what it is. 
[02:17:30]  It's a lack of, it's a weird lack of connect, like a weird lack of connection.  I don't think it's hateful motives.  It's just a weird, it's the same thing we run into.  Like, there's a weird corporate, it's a weird window that you're talking to people through.  It's those dumb little things.  I bring this shit up because it's the dumb little things that makes us a little happier  and makes the people listening to us a little happier when it happens to them and their fucking  jobs.  How do you not, like, show up at a memorial for a guy that was a massive force for this 
[02:18:00]  company and basically worked for free?  You know, he got his money the other way.  He got more people to show up for his gigs and stuff like that, sure.  But in the end, this company didn't have to pay him for all that amazing radio.  By tomorrow, I may have a better answer for that, though.  There may be something really good.  The second one with the Patrice issue.  Tomorrow, I'm not going to kill them on that because there might be some good news.  I'll know by tomorrow.  Is it the thing?  Maybe, yeah.  But the other thing...  Is it a money-making thing?  Possibly.  I don't know.  Well, that's a no-brainer. 
[02:18:30]  They better do that, too.  No slack for these fuckers.  But the Michael C. Hall thing has nothing to do with that.  Oh, boy.  And, um...  Oh, boy.  It's unacceptable.  It ain't right.  And it's not something I've ever...  Do you have more info on this?  No.  No, and I don't want to throw anybody into the bus until we know.  All right.  I worked in urology.  Over the holidays, all the old people are looking for Viagra.  Oh, shit.  A lot of these people in this place I was at last night, they're down to fuck. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, I know why.  There's no doubt in my mind, man.  Really?  There's no doubt in my mind.  Yeesh.  Why?  Certainly heavy petting.  You think your mom's down to fuck?  Is he white?  There's a lot of questions that need to be answered.  He's an old Negro.  I will certainly let Sam have the spotlight.  Enjoy it.  Enjoy it. 
[02:19:30]  I've got to take my shots while I can.  Enjoy it.  Because I didn't know we were going this way.  I didn't know we were going down this road.  That's fine, though.  I can play.  I can play on this road as well.  I just want to know.  I can play on this road, Sam.  I just want to know.  You want to talk to the urologist?  Do you want to know, would sex only be vaginal, or would there possibly be other options?  Where do you put it?  It's a question on everybody's mind.  92?  92.  But he's got a great body. 
[02:20:00]  She said he had a nice body.  I'm like, what?  Is that possible if you're 92?  Yeah.  Look at these boys.  He's in the 70s, right?  He looks horrible.  That's a big difference.  He looks terrible.  What are you talking about?  The guy's probably one of those old fucking...  But I'm just saying, Bridges of Madison County, he took his shirt off, and he was probably  only in his 70s then.  He looked horrible.  Andrea, what's up?  Hello.  You know what?  Hello.  Hi, Andrea.  What?  What do you want? 
[02:20:30]  What's up?  Hi, what's up, Andrea?  You're on the air.  We got you.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I work at a urology group, and I just wanted to let you know that they definitely...  She was going to say they definitely fuck at that age?  Yeah, definitely.  Those cocks definitely work.  They all look for Viagra or something.  Oh, what's this?  I'm not part of this.  I got to hear this.  The guy's giving me dirty looks in the hall.  He doesn't even fucking say hi to me.  I'm done with it.  I got to hear this. 
[02:21:00]  So someone else fucking do this.  What do you mean?  What do you...  Who?  Fez.  Gives me dirty looks in the hall now, even though everyone is having a little fun with Fez.  So I'm going to officially say I'm not part of this next minute and a half.  Well, this has to do with our buddy Colin Quinn, who, as you know, goes on Twitter and tweets  hysterical things, and people actually take him seriously.  And they just stop following him.  He retweets everybody that insults him and calls him horrible and unfunny.  And they look like idiots because it's obvious. 
[02:21:30]  It's Colin.  It's obvious to everyone that he's just fucking with everybody.  When he writes shit like, you know, I'm all for freedom of speech, but somebody really  should regulate what people say.  It's like, that's hysterical to me.  Right.  Well, I guess he was having a little fun.  And the joke is that people are actually buying into it.  Yes.  And then he retweets it.  And that's what makes it fun for everybody else.  Well, I guess he tweeted that he had a problem with a bit that was on SNL.  And he said that he didn't appreciate it. 
[02:22:00]  And it was reported as a real tweet and real kind of news thing by our own Fez Wadley.  Colin Quinn was calling out Saturday Night Live over their parody sketch about the Penn State  Sandusky scandal.  So he said he's ashamed that he was ever associated with that show.  Do you want to Google Colin Quinn?  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  I mean, I did.  See if this is what he always does with his Twitter, that he's just fucking around.  Oh, okay.  Remember we just had this story not too long ago where he said, I forget who he fucking  ran down, but it was supposed to be like, then he's going back.  Please, I'm fucking joking.  I think it was Will Ferrell being high.  Oh, yeah.  Will Ferrell was high every time I saw him.  Remember that story?  Yeah.  I fell for it.  I'm an idiot. 
[02:23:00]  And that was all I had in news.  Tuesday is news day.  Twofer.  Yeah.  I didn't have enough.  Oh, no.  How far did you fall short?  Three hours and 50 minutes.  Come on. 
[02:23:30]  I thought that the Colin Quinn thing was going to have legs.  All right.  It is the Ron and Fez show.  Eight, six, six.  Ron, zero, Fez.  Let the record state Anthony was laughing hysterically.  I kept my mouth shut.  How could you not?  I don't want to deal with that shit.  How could you not laugh?  Well.  He thought it was real.  Joy, the dirty looks in the hallway.  No, just.  It's the same way.  You bust each other's balls.  I just thought it was funny.  I just thought it was very funny.  And then coming up three hours and 50 minutes short on material. 
[02:24:00]  That was funny.  What's the thing?  Fez takes over Tuesdays and does a lot of news?  Tuesdays, Newsday?  What do we know on that, Sam?  Yeah, Tuesdays, Newsday.  And it's sort of like you start the show with news.  And then I think Ron is letting Fez have the ball.  Uh-huh.  But then Fez does ten minutes.  Uh-huh.  How's that?  All right.  Well, Anthony Bourdain is here.  Oh, cool.  You sure?  Is he coming in?  He's right by the door. 
[02:24:30]  Excellent.  Let's bring him in.  Yes.  Let's make sure that the other shows won't take him  and then we can't have him.  No, I just want to make sure.  I don't want to step on any toes.  For the people that are confused,  everything comes out in the wash.  Not everything just comes out.  In the wash.  In the end, I mean.  But I don't want to be a jerk.  Right now, we know the facts.  Yeah, I don't.  I'll help you tote it.  We're doing some investigating.  And Jimmy certainly will have a lot to say.  Yeah, well.  But right now, he has, you know,  some vague things to say.  What are you doing, wash?  I want to make sure. 
[02:25:00]  Again.  I understand.  Because I want to make sure nobody told his publishers  that we can't take him or we'll cancel him  if he's on another show.  I just want to make sure that didn't happen.  Because why would you do that?  Okay.  I don't comprehend it.  That would be crazy.  All right, let's get him in.  I'm happy to talk to him.  Yes.  Let's bring him in.  It's not a Howard situation, is it?  Here he goes.  No.  Oh.  I would understand that.  Hello, Anthony Bourdain.  Fuck yeah, Anthony Bourdain.  I love making a seat right there, my friend.  How are you, sir?  Feeling good?  I fucking love Anthony Bourdain.  You just missed Joe Rogan.  He's a big fan of yours. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Joe was here.  Yeah, he's easy.  But he's got to do TV today.  You know, the whole Fear Factor thing.  He's got to take Al Roker.  Fear Factor thing is back with a vengeance.  Holy Jesus.  Looks better than ever.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good for him.  I like him a lot.  Yeah, he's an interesting guy, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's crazy.  You on his podcast?  I love doing that podcast.  It's a brain-damaging podcast.  It really is, right?  It blows up your mind, right?  It does indeed.  Makes you feel weird about your own humanity.  Yeah, it makes this seem really stupid.  Why bother?  It's strangely cotton-mouthed right through the whole thing. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which can only be solved by, you know, massive infusions of beer.  So by the end of the two hours or whatever, you're baked.  It really is an entertaining podcast.  I don't know how Joe gets as much done high as he does.  Like, when I got high, I got nothing done.  And Rogan is just, he's doing television shows.  Very functional.  And he's reading and podcasting.  He's a really bright guy.  It's unbelievable.  Raising kids.  Very, very functional.  Yeah, and I think he grapples.  I mean, he trains.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't, you know.  Isn't that crazy?  I'm sitting there too lazy to change the channel for My Little Pony. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  You want to talk about The Layover?  The new show, huh?  The Layover, yes.  On the Travel Channel, Mondays at 9 p.m.  Yeah, it's sort of a more useful version of No Reservations.  I mean, in all these years of staggering around the world, me and the crew have kind of figured out, you know, good stuff to do in a short period of time.  So, you know, this time out, we tried to do something that's actually useful.  Yeah.  And the concept is, what, we all have layovers?  Well, we're joking about it because we've never really had a 48-hour layover because we're not international travelers. 
[02:27:00]  You know, we fly to Cleveland every once in a while.  Yeah.  Or L.A.  That's it for us.  I think the more likely scenario is, you know, you're a lot of people that take those, you know, 10 days in Italy, you know, two days in Bologna, two days in Venice, two days in Rome.  So, you know, if you find yourself in Rome for two days, you know, I have very strong opinions about what you should be doing and what you probably shouldn't be wasting your time doing.  Right.  But, you know, if you go to Rome, you find an olive garden.  It's wonderful.  Well, if you go to Rome, what's the hack thing everyone does that they shouldn't?  I mean, personally, you know, I wouldn't be standing on a line for anything. 
[02:27:30]  Rome is a beautiful city with a lot of great food in it.  To be standing on a line for the Vatican seems like a waste of time to me.  You know, I'd be eating, and I'd be eating stuff that the Romans are good at, and I would be eating a veal cutlet milanes.  That's from Milan.  I mean, cacio e pepe, which is what makes Romans happy.  So, you know, you do what the Romans are doing.  It seems like a fundamental message, but, you know, I mean, let's put it this way.  You know, if you're lucky enough to go to Hong Kong and you're spending, you know, two minutes of your life eating at the Hard Rock Cafe, there's something serious. 
[02:28:00]  You aren't an idiot, right?  You aren't an idiot.  Let's bring it back to home, home base, New York City.  We're a block away from Times Square, and every once in a while you walk through there because you have to.  If you live in New York, you want to avoid Times Square, but, you know, go down to Caroline's Great Comic Club or something.  You find yourself in Times Square.  These people come from all over the world, and they're hanging out in Times Square.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Do you need a Bubba Gum from the Olive Garden?  Just hang yourself in the shower.  Save the money.  Do you realize how cool New York is?  Get the fuck away from Times Square. 
[02:28:30]  You'll see some great stuff.  Great restaurants.  What do we do when you ask yourself the same question anywhere you go?  What do we do in New York better than anybody else?  That's what you're looking for, and what we do better than anybody else is, you know, a pastrami sandwich.  We do deli better than anybody.  Sure.  So I'd be hitting Cats' Deli or Russ and Daughters or Barney Greengrass.  I'd get myself, you know, a good New York deli experience.  Right.  You know, if I were from Tulsa, you know, I would not, and I'm about to walk into a deli, and there's a giant tour bus out front that says, you know, Tulsa on it.  I mean, clearly you're not eating in the right place. 
[02:29:00]  You want to go where a bunch of cranky New Yorkers.  You're not even hanging out with New Yorkers.  You're just hanging out with other tourists in Times Square.  Yeah.  Times Square is worth looking at for maybe a half hour.  Maybe.  Not even.  I mean.  I'm being polite.  Take a picture of the big ball that falls on New Yorkers.  Years ago it was worth it, though.  When you could go to go see all the porn shops, then it would have a different vibe to it.  The first thing you tourists would see when they come to Times Square was, you know, a big marquee, an anal rampage three.  You know, it was like, awesome.  I love some of that seedy shit, right? 
[02:29:30]  Three was much better than two, by the way.  Yeah.  Two was terrible lighting.  It was really poorly edited.  Unanswered questions.  But I bring that up because every city has that, and you get lost just doing the touristy thing when you're not really getting the feel of the place.  So, I mean, over time we've been to a lot of these cities, and, you know, we've had a lot of sort of crew meals where we just said, wow, we should have filmed this.  This was totally awesome.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And to a great extent those are the type of places we're covering.  So where have you been with this show?  We actually shot my part in 48 hours in each place. 
[02:30:00]  So it was really a brutal regimen of shoveling food and liquor into my face.  So 48 hours in Singapore, Hong Kong, Montreal, San Francisco, L.A., Miami, New York, Rome, London, and Amsterdam.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's an insane schedule.  Yeah.  All in one weekend.  Amsterdam was tough because, you know, it seems like a good idea going to one of the coffee shops. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  You know, like if you're ever really, really stunned and you think everybody's looking at you, you know?  Like I had one of those moments where I look up and everyone is looking at me.  They are, yeah.  There's three cameras in my face, and I'm just completely tweaking out.  Is it all just about food and drink, or do you show people a lot of the things they could do in these cities?  Yeah, if there's something cool, fast and cool to do.  But certainly, you know, as a chef for 28 years, I'm kind of looking at the place from a food-centric point of view.  And let's face it, food and liquor is your quickest way into the kind of essence of a place anyway, 
[02:31:00]  sitting down with the locals, eating what they like to eat.  Right.  You know, it brings down barriers pretty quickly.  Do you have any fear?  Because my manager travels a lot, and he's eating like raw meat in Ethiopia, like outdoor markets had flies on it.  Like he's a psychopath.  And do you have any fear of getting sick in these?  Because I'm such a food-poisoning paranoid person.  I don't know.  In our experience over the years, you are far – the people who get poisoned on our crew,  it's always the breakfast buffet at the major chain hotel.  Right, you know, if you're eating street food – if there's a long line of Mexicans, you know, at a taco place, 
[02:31:30]  like a little cart out in the street, bare light bulb, room temperature, pig's head getting hacked up and rolled up in a fresh tortilla.  You know, this guy is not in business year after year for poisoning his neighbors.  If there's 30 Mexicans in Mexico lined up for this thing, I'm betting it's pretty good.  Right, right.  So I find it far safer, just, you know, pick a crowded place popularly with locals.  Chances are you're going to be good.  I've been poisoned. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, obviously you're going to spend a little, you know, porcelain bus time here and there.  You're eating around India regularly.  You're going to be spending more time in the thunder bucket than – it's a small price.  You're going to be familiarizing yourself with the bathrooms.  Both times I was poisoned, I knew ahead of time that I was going to pay a terrible price.  Oh, you did?  Was it raw and bad, or was it just not for your system?  It was a tribal situation.  You know, the chief's standing there.  All of his tribe are standing behind.  He's very proud.  He's holding up some meat that clearly has seen better days. 
[02:32:30]  Holy shit.  Everybody's eating it with, you know, their hands in a situation where, you know, wash hands after using bathroom is not –  Right, right.  I had a pretty good idea what was coming, but I tried very, very hard to be a good guest.  Did the locals get sick too?  No, the people have –  So you're getting sick and they're fine.  You know, when you're at grandma's house, you eat what grandma offers.  Right.  Was it cooked meat or raw?  It was cooked, but, you know –  What kind of meat was it?  You remember?  Oh, dude. 
[02:33:00]  You know, they're hungry.  They're giving you the best they've got that they worked real hard to get.  And I think, you know, this is like an important moment in relationships around the world.  You smile and you accept it in good grace.  And did you get sick there in front of them?  No, no.  It was, you know, a couple of days later, a long course of antibiotics kind of thing.  Oh, a couple of days later, was it salmonella?  Bacterial thing.  Oh, okay.  At another time, it was just, you know –  So it wasn't 24 hours.  You know, hands in – Liberia, I was – 
[02:33:30]  Oh, gosh.  You know, crawling on my hands and knees for two days.  Your brain forgot to kill me.  What was that food?  That was probably, you know, bushmeat.  Who knows what it – you know, take your pick.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting sick.  Are you worried about parasites?  I've been really lucky.  That's something I really haven't had any of those.  It's a constant source of humor on the road.  We're always making like – you know, because, of course, we're well familiar with all of them.  So guinea worm jokes are really big on the show.  Oh, yeah.  What are those? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, dude, you don't want to hear this.  I do.  It's like a six-foot-tall worm that crawls around under your skin and pops its head up  now and again, and you've got to wheel them out.  I saw that on that show, that parents are monsters inside us, they call it.  Huge problem in Africa.  Can you see it moving under your skin?  Yeah, apparently.  It's really painful and really tough to get rid of.  Really easy to prevent.  I think Jimmy Carter is heavily involved in eradicating the problem.  Liver fluke doesn't sound like a good thing, right?  What's a liver fluke?  You don't want eggs in your liver.  You don't want things hatching in your liver.  No.  Liver fluke.  It just sounds bad. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that sounds terrible.  So far, so good.  I want to go back to the food.  Obviously, you've eaten stuff that has made you really sick, but what's the worst thing  you've eaten?  The worst thing I've eaten was, I think it's called harkarl in Iceland.  It's their sort of national, traditional dish on their Torreblat holiday.  And it's basically putrefied fish that they then pickle for six months.  And the stench alone would stop like a charging rhino.  And they sit there going, I don't understand why they enjoy this.  It's a Viking thing.  It goes back to when they didn't have refrigerators. 
[02:35:00]  And it's sort of their show.  They're proud of their Viking roots.  I mean, the cooks handle it with rubber gloves, which should be a warning, I think.  And you eat it?  Were you able to keep it down?  One bite of that was enough.  You do that with a lot of shots.  Did you keep it down?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do people eat like a whole helping of it, or is it a bite?  No, it's more of a snacky little piece of it.  So they hate it, too.  They kind of want the tradition to go away.  Enough with the Vikings.  I know, let it go.  If they had refrigerators, the Vikings would look like, what are you assholes doing? 
[02:35:30]  Put it in the freezer.  Most of the young people in Iceland are like, wait, we don't have to eat this shit anymore.  Right, right.  Putrefied?  How do they putrefy it?  I think they throw it in the ground and just let it rot.  Oh, man.  There's just no way that's a good thing, right?  Nah, I don't think so.  I love hearing about bad food.  It's more interesting to me than good food because it scares me.  Good food everybody loves, but bad food is terrifying.  I don't get angry at that.  I get angry when somebody fucks up a simple good thing like a bowl of pasta, though.  That's when I get upset. 
[02:36:00]  You know what?  That's funny you should say that.  I live in New York, and I do take out a lot, and I can't find a good bowl of pasta.  That's all I want.  Well, pasta that travels take out is good.  Right.  But even if I go to the restaurants, I can't find it for the most part.  It's so much easier.  How do you fuck that up?  Yeah.  You have to work extra hard and add extra ingredients and spend extra time to fuck up a simple good thing like a bowl of pasta, which is what drives me completely insane.  If you want pasta, you want just a basic bowl of pasta. 
[02:36:30]  You don't need the-  20 minutes, a can of good plum tomatoes, a clove of garlic, and a leaf of freaking basil.  Thank you.  How hard is it?  Thank you.  You don't need to make fresh, any of that.  You have a nice bowl like most Italians, but people insist on, I don't know, chicken, Caesar, pasta.  Just too much chicken.  What is that?  Now, cooking for so long, do you find yourself very critical of what you eat, and does that ruin it?  When it comes to food, I'm actually, I mean, I'm really happy with a dirty water hot dog. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, really?  Okay.  You know, if I like, I mean, I eat street food for the majority of my time abroad, and I think it's true of most chefs.  What chefs want to have to work is something really simple.  You can, you know, mop sauce with a crust of bread.  I don't want little towers of tweaked out food.  I always get the impression that other chefs would be intimidated if there's a chef there.  Like, if you showed up at a restaurant, I would assume that the chef would be very like, oh, boy, here he is. 
[02:37:30]  I mean, I consider chefs the home team.  I'm for anybody who's doing the best they can.  Yeah.  If I don't like the meal, I'm not going to freak out.  You're not one of those guys that screams, this is shit.  I'm not a critic.  I'm an enthusiast.  What's this crap?  I just saw Ratatouille.  Throw it against the wall.  I love that film.  My son loves it now.  I cried like a baby.  Thank God.  Did you?  I didn't see it.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, when the Antony goes, you know, Ratatouille scene where he turns into a little boy.  I was like, yeah.  You love it.  Get Patton Oswalt on the phone with your kid. 
[02:38:00]  We had him on yesterday.  It was a weird day.  We had Patton Oswalt, and then I had to drive back and forth to Long Island with Ratatouille in the car.  I mean, have him call your kid.  That's not a bad idea.  My kid doesn't understand on that level yet, but eventually I'm going to fucking call in that favor.  What do you think the fascination with celebrity chefs is?  Because it's a weird thing that has happened.  Like, maybe it's just the next logical step in watching people do stuff.  Well, in a lot of ways, I think we're catching up with the rest of the world.  We're actually thinking about food, and we care what we're eating, and it means something. 
[02:38:30]  And, you know, when I started out in the business, nobody was interested in what the chef thought.  They didn't care what the chef thought was good.  They didn't care what the chef believed himself to be good at or what he liked to eat.  You know, the chefs were backstairs help.  They were the service, you know, people.  And people in general weren't that concerned with food.  They looked at it like filling up at the gas station.  I don't know why it changed.  I think people like Emeril probably were really helpful in that regard.  But the fact that it did change is good. 
[02:39:00]  I mean, chefs are empowered.  You go in a restaurant now.  You go to a Mario Batali restaurant.  You kind of want to know what the chef there thinks is good.  I'll have your best game.  You know what you're better at.  You know better than me.  People are more willing to try new stuff.  And because of that, you're, by and large, reading better.  Did you eat sushi when you were in Japan?  Oh, yeah.  This is like, I remember it says it's great there, but is it right?  Well, there's great sushi in New York.  There is sushi in New York that's as good as almost all the sushi in Japan. 
[02:39:30]  What's the best one in New York?  Well, Masa is the most expensive restaurant in America.  That's certainly.  Where's that?  That's in the Time Warner Center.  Oh, yeah.  I have seen that.  Oh, right.  And how many?  Yasuda is awesome.  There are a bunch.  I mean, again, if they get a large Japanese clientele, you're on safe ground.  What you need to know about sushi is it's about the rice.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the Sushi Master takes like three to seven years learning just how to do the  rice right.  And then, of course, they're paying a lot for that food.  That's silly.  I could figure out rice.  Yeah, it's just rice.  It's just rice. 
[02:40:00]  Rice around now.  I could never.  If I spent the rest of my life learning, I would never.  Well, what are you figuring out?  First of all, where you're getting your rice and what mix you're making.  And really, these guys, how tight you're squeezing it, how perfect.  It's such a consistency.  It can't be too dry.  It's got to be sticky.  You want it hot, crumbly.  You want it still a little warm, sort of crumbly.  When you're eating sushi in a high-end place, you eat it with your fingers.  If you pick it up with the chopsticks, the sushi chef's going to squeeze it a little  tighter for you because you're a dumbass.  Right.  Tell them about the place in LA. 
[02:40:30]  Nazawa.  You're eating Nazawa?  It's in Studio City?  Wait a minute.  I've heard about this.  It's really good, right?  It's amazing.  But he only serves fish.  You can't get anything.  Like, you know, California rolls.  Not a place you go and ask for a California roll.  Oh, no.  No, but it's a bizarre little strip mall place that looks like nothing, but it's the  best sushi I've had anywhere.  I've eaten at some pretty good sushi places.  You know how to piss that guy off.  You go in, you're one of these goofs who, like, immediately, before you've even had  a piece of sushi, you pour a big thing of, like, soy sauce into the dish, and  then you take a big wad of the wasabi and start mixing it up in there. 
[02:41:00]  You're killing that guy.  You're basically spitting in the milk of his mother, you know?  But, dude, I use soy on everything.  I like a little.  I just like it with all.  Not that place, man.  You want him to like you, right?  I want him to give you the good stuff that he's saving for the Japanese customers, right?  He's tired of my fat face in there, but I really do like soy on everything.  Does he recognize you yet?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He actually saw me on Leno one time, and he's like, oh.  And then he was always nice to me.  So no soy sauce at all?  You ask.  Yeah.  Basically, you go to a really high end.  You know, you're lucky enough to afford a super high end, really good sushi bar. 
[02:41:30]  You sit down at the bar, and you say, you decide, and you smile a lot or not, depending  on how you like it, because he's making a lot of decisions about, it's like your friendly  neighborhood bartender in a lot of ways.  He's making decisions as you're eating based on how you're reacting to his food.  That's pretty amazing.  And you ask, sauce, no sauce.  He'll tell you.  And they're always right.  And how much is Masa, the most expensive restaurant?  Like, what's the average?  You can spend $1,800 for two people there. 
[02:42:00]  And I doubt very much that he's ever made money at that restaurant.  Wow.  I've heard he's spent up to over hundreds of dollars a pound for his super high.  That's wholesale for some of his super high end tuna.  Now, that's not something you want to do every day, even if you got a lot of bucks.  Yeah, right.  But that's a meal you will remember for the rest of your life.  I would like to try it once, even though it's really expensive.  I would like to see how much better is it than Nozawa, if it is at all, because he's  like legendary for getting the best fish. 
[02:42:30]  And other sushi chefs try to find where he gets to stay.  He's one of those guys, like a really, really old guy from Japan.  Is there anything worse than a piece of tuna that's slightly gray?  Stringy or stringy.  Slightly gray.  Yeah, it's horrible.  What are you doing?  But it's not about the freshest fish.  No?  In fact, it's often about the fish that they know just when to serve it.  Maybe it's two days in.  Oh, really?  Two days in.  It's at the right temperature.  Really?  Not too cold.  You want to be able to, each fish has a different perfect temperature.  The rice.  I mean, there's a whole speck.  There's, you know, there's good, there's utility sushi. 
[02:43:00]  There's good sushi.  And then there's really, really, really great sushi.  Is utility sushi the places that have 50% off for lunch?  Yeah, pretty much.  I want to try that master place.  I don't know if I can afford that much, but you need to bring a girl who you know is going  to fuck.  You know what?  Actually, I make basic decisions, or I used to make basic decisions about, you know, date  night.  I'd, you know, I'd bring a woman to Masa, and then, you know, she didn't eat the uni, 
[02:43:30]  the sea urchin.  There's, the sex is just not going to be good.  There's no possibility.  I love sea urchin.  It's grown on me.  No.  Salmon roll I won't eat.  Those little weird fucking glowing eggs.  The big orange eggs.  I don't like those rough.  I love sea urchins rough.  There's no possibility of fellatio if she's not going for the uni.  That's a good way to look at it.  But if she takes the uni and she squeezes it on her face, she's a trooper.  She's rubbing uni in her hair.  I got another question that only a 12-year-old would ask, I guess, but I got to ask. 
[02:44:00]  Your favorite place in the world?  You've been everywhere.  Favorite place?  Wow.  You know, I like Southeast Asia in general.  Vietnam is really awesome.  Fits in.  What makes it cool?  It's just like, you know, I never, I hadn't really been anywhere until I was 44, and it  was the sort of place I dreamed of, you know.  So I had expectations of what the, you know, exotic Vietnam would be like, and when I actually  got there, it was way better.  You know, great people, amazing food, amazing, the country just smells good.  Everything's delicious. 
[02:44:30]  I had a friend that went down to Vietnam and, you know, backpacking and all that.  I did, too.  Never came back.  And he, uh, back in a body bag.  Like a really nice hotel.  It's like five bucks.  It's just, he couldn't believe how far his money went down there.  It's just beautiful, and the people are food crazy, and they're really proud.  They're proud of their food.  So, you know, strangers will feed you, you know, just to show you how good they got  it.  It's, uh...  They like Americans there now?  I mean, they love them.  They do like Americans.  They really, you know, they've been fighting for 600 years.  So, you know, I asked about this.  I said, you know, aren't you guys pissed? 
[02:45:00]  And they're like, don't flatter yourself.  Before you, there was the Japanese, the French, the Chinese.  After you, there were the Chinese, the Cambodians.  They say, you know, sit down, eat, let's get drunk.  I got some rice whiskey here.  Look how good we got it.  Um, what was the worst, uh, alcohol?  Worst alcohol?  Oh, God.  I've seen some of this shit.  I mean, a lot of cloudy, you know, shit with particles in it, and old, you know, old, uh,  diet, you know, Pepsi jugs.  And somebody's, just about everywhere in the developing world, somebody's fermenting something  or distilling something in a 55-gallon drum, and they, they want you to have some of it. 
[02:45:30]  Or the snakes in it, or whatever.  Well, you know, one of the, one of the gestures that I dread is when you're, you're, people are  being really nice, and you're in their home, and they say, I have something very special  for you, and then they make this gesture, this will make you strong.  It's like, oh, no, you know, something, something's going in that drink, and what has  it been?  It means there's going to be some dick involved, or, uh, bile, or some kind of essence of something  that, that, you know.  So, I mean, it's something you don't want to.  They worry about bumpers a lot in certain, in parts of Southeast Asia. 
[02:46:00]  We all do.  Let's see.  What's, what's really good for the erection?  Let's see.  Uh, you know, I don't think anyone ever, you know, ever, for all of the, many times I've  heard around the world, this will make you strong, you know.  I don't think I ever start up from a meal, you know, with a raging heart on it.  Right.  You know, sow my seed right now.  But did you feel something going on in the area?  Do oysters do that?  Because I'll eat something.  Do oysters just try to make you more potent.  Did it feel a little more alive after you got up?  Did it jump?  Did it jump a little?  No.  No? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, I don't think that works.  Whatever's in Viagra and Cialis, I guess, is just, is just, is just it.  You know, I actually sent through a third party, you know, I'm not, I'm not the friendliest  guy towards the vegans and vegetarians and PETA types.  And I actually sent word through a neutral party to the annoying Paul McCartney that, you  know, if he just, if he really wanted to save some cute animals, he should spend his  money on, like, buying, like, 10 million hits of Viagra and spread it around Southeast Asia  where they're always, you know, whacking rhinos for the horns and, you know, draining bile  out of bears.  You know, give him something that works and he'll stop killing these cute little animals. 
[02:47:00]  And the problem with vegan food is some of it's really good.  Like, there's a place called Gobo on 6th Avenue which has great vegan food.  But so much of it is just awful.  It's rough.  I wish it was good.  Hey, look, I like animals.  I really did try.  I would eat vegan.  Wouldn't it be better with, like, you know, a hunk of slow-cooked pork in there?  Yeah.  Or if they got something that tasted just like pork.  Like, I would like that.  But they don't.  Only good pork.  You always feel like you're missing something.  They call it something different.  Like chicken.  Yeah.  The dish would be great if it had a little chicken in it.  The only place I can eat vegan, basically, or vegetarian for a sustained period of time  is India.  I mean, that food tastes good, you know? 
[02:47:30]  I don't like when they call it, like, tofurky.  Would you like some perk?  No, I don't.  Do you want a not dog?  I mean, is it tofu or is it a fucking turkey?  Make up your mind.  I find it really disturbing with this sort of weird franken-turkey coming in there.  Like, texture-wise, it's just awful.  And it doesn't taste like the actual meat.  They try to make it taste like what you would season the meat with because they can't make  it taste like turkey.  So they put smoky shit on it and everything.  It's terrible.  One of my...  My girl used to be a vegetarian. 
[02:48:00]  It was a pain in the ass.  Throw me nuts, right?  Go out.  Go into my family's house, you know.  We got a big Italian family.  We go over there for Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve and stuff.  And it's just a shitload of great food.  And she's like, ah, you know, could you make me a pasta and just a salad?  And you miss out on everything.  I don't find vegetarians to be as...  Vegans, I think, are a little more annoying because they don't use any animal products.  Like, all right, you don't want to eat a burger.  That's one thing.  But what do you mean you won't eat fucking honey, asshole?  They want to give chickens the vote. 
[02:48:30]  The chicken didn't make a decision to end up on your plate.  Well, you know.  That's, you know, top of the food chain here.  Sorry for the opposable thumb.  Chris in New Hampshire wants us to ask you about Squeezle?  Squeezle, yeah.  It was just a great misnomer.  I was with a Vietnamese friend of mine, and we'd pull off at the side of the road.  He'd planned a big meal there, and this place was, like, completely empty.  They hadn't been open for ages, clearly.  And I'm trying to get...  He works part-time for the interior ministry, so naturally these people were a little concerned. 
[02:49:00]  Hurriedly open up, start looking around for something to serve us.  And I'm saying, well, what do they have here, man?  I mean, what's the big specialty?  Why are you so determined?  Yes, they serve woodland creatures.  And I said, well, what woodland creature?  And he's like, I think you call it Squeezle.  And he was thinking of squirrel and weasel, I guess.  Oh, shit.  I don't know what the hell it was.  It had some sort of spines on it.  But I think it entered the lexicon.  It's now, I think, if you go to Urban Dictionary, the word Squeezle is now kind of a word. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, it's not a real thing?  Well, now it is.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Was it any good?  Listen, I've had, I'd rather eat Squeezle than Olive Garden.  Yeah, yeah.  Olive Garden is a bad rap.  Is it really that shitty Italian food?  Or is it just all right?  I think, listen, it's like this.  If you're planning on opening an Italian restaurant, I think it's important that you just ask yourself  a simple question.  Can any Italian grandmother in the entire nation of Italy cook better fucking Italian food  than I'm planning on serving?  That should be the threshold.  And if the answer is, yes, they can cook better than anything I'm ever planning on serving, 
[02:50:00]  you should stay the fuck out of the Italian restaurant.  Fair enough.  Where's the best side?  Like, I like Morton's as a chain place, which I think is really good.  And that probably makes you want to spit on me.  But really, I do love it.  Where's a great steak place in New York?  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I like Peter Luger's Horrific.  Love Luger's.  I've never eaten there.  You've never been to Luger's?  We're at Pauly Castellano.  We get West Sparks is good.  Yeah.  Sparks Steakhouse, yeah.  Do you like the Porterhouse?  Porterhouse is great.  Love Porterhouse.  You've got to do the Luger's experience.  I know, but they don't take credit cards.  You go to Brooklyn, it's all cash. 
[02:50:30]  It's wooden tables.  It's just...  It's possible to have a good chain restaurant, though.  I mean, look at In-N-Out Burger.  That's a decent burger.  You know, Shake Shack, arguably, is a chain at this point.  That's quality stuff.  So it doesn't have to be bad.  It doesn't have to be dumbed down.  It's, you know, I think it's our...  And I'm just against any place that refuses to serve me a burger below medium.  What are you telling me?  You're saying, for your safety, we have to cook this well done.  Why are you treating my burger, my birthright as an American citizen, our national dish? 
[02:51:00]  Why do I have to treat this shit like medical waste?  This is unpatriotic to ask who this is Americans.  And I'm really, really angry about it.  How do you like a burger?  Medium rare is the optimum temperature for a burger.  Really?  And a steak, to me.  You know, if you like rare, good.  I respect you all the better.  Personally, you know, medium rare, a bit on the rare side.  I prefer well done.  I actually like the taste a lot.  Life is bereft of the true pleasure.  Medium rare.  You're probably right. 
[02:51:30]  I've tried it, but I didn't like it as much where I could taste the blood.  I just didn't like it.  It didn't scare me.  I just didn't like it.  Oh, it's so good.  It was too chewy.  It was a little too chewy.  You went to Machu Picchu?  I've been to Machu Picchu.  What's that?  It's a place I want to go so bad.  It's the fucking old civilization in the clouds, basically.  The hidden city of the Incas on the top of the mountains.  The Spanish never found it.  Did I take Ayahuasca?  Yes.  The trail, right?  Oh, I thought you were going to talk about the...  Train?  Yeah, I took the train.  I'm not humping up no mountain.  No, suppose you can hump up the mountain and it's an experience in itself. 
[02:52:00]  It is an experience.  I should warn anyone who's considering doing that.  The mosquitoes there are the most horrifying I've ever encountered.  Why?  They're tiny.  They're tiny, but pound for pound, they deliver more damaging bites than any place I've ever been.  And I mean, three weeks later, you're getting raided.  Oh, shit.  You're bleeding bumps.  Really?  Really bad.  So how long does this train take to get to the top of the mountain?  Quick, like, I don't know, an hour or two.  And it's a swank old train, too.  You know, bar, car. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, you're cocktailing on your way up.  Where's this place?  That's nice.  There's hotels up there now.  Oh, Peru.  Okay.  Yeah, there's at least two really good hotels, one all the way up by Machu Picchu.  You never see that when they show you Machu Picchu on TV.  Yeah, but it's not ugly.  It's low to the ground.  It's kind of tucked in.  I mean, it's real nice.  How high up in the mountain?  I feel like an eight-year-old.  Way high.  Like, you're having trouble breathing high.  Oh, really?  Is it like Denver or much higher?  Way higher, I believe.  I mean, you're chewing coca leaves and not for its recreational value.  And if you're carrying a can of oxygen, they pump the oxygen in hotel rooms in some places. 
[02:53:00]  And you need it.  You're not feeling too good up around there.  What do the coca leaves do?  Not much, but they do seem to ameliorate, you know, like I don't do coke anymore, but  I would chew leaves if I'm up that high.  Do you have to?  It helps a little bit.  Same feeling as doing coke?  No, no, no, no, no.  It doesn't, or I wouldn't do it.  I mean, it doesn't get you high.  I just don't know.  Okay.  But for some reason, it seems to ameliorate the altitude sickness. 
[02:53:30]  Is it clear?  It probably opens up your...  You liked it up there?  Your lungs.  It's incredible.  It's like Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat are two places that you just, you look at it and  you just pinch yourself and say, I can't believe it.  And it goes with the Joe Rogan thing.  Like, how the hell did they build this up there?  Well, they were enterprising, hardworking people.  This notion that aliens came and showed these, you know, dumbass Incas how to do it is completely  ridiculous.  You know, they, you know, they had slave labor and a cause and, you know, a lot of spare 
[02:54:00]  time.  And they did it like they built, you know, like people built the pyramids or, you know,  Epcot Center.  I mean...  How big is it?  Huge.  Huge.  And...  Like, is there more than a thousand people in the city?  Oh, yeah.  It was a big, big city.  Oh, no one's there anymore.  Angkor Wat, there were over a million people living there.  But I mean...  No one lives there, obviously.  Uh, no.  The mountain city nobody lives in?  No.  It's...  These are not viable structures.  Yeah, it's old ruins.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It's old ruins.  I didn't...  It sounds cool.  But there's hotels up there, new hotels?  Oh, there's sort of a hotel.  Yeah.  And then they're nearby town.  There's lodges and hotels as well.  All right.  That sounds kind of cool.  But it's really an amazing experience doing that.  I hear.  Someday, maybe.  We're here and we have to let you go.  This sucks.  Yeah.  Can I plug the show?  Yeah, of course.  No, let's make sure people...  Monday, layover you mentioned, but Monday, maybe the darkest, most twisted, fucked up episode  of television we've ever done.  Every once in a while, we do a really dysfunctional holiday special. 
[02:55:00]  And really disturbing.  Always terrifying to our cruel masters.  And this time we have, finally, I have to use it, Christopher Walken on the show.  Oh, nice.  Working with Christopher Walken.  We got Nora Jones to do the score of the show and do scatological Catalonian pooping  log-related songs.  It's ultra-violent.  It's dark, twisted.  The band Fucked Up is on as well.  It is a strange, disturbing, and wonderful hour of television that I'm really proud of. 
[02:55:30]  We were put on Earth to make shows.  It's just terrifying.  This one that's coming up Monday?  Monday.  And that's part of the layover?  The new show?  No, this is No Reservations.  Oh, No Reservations.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I think layover was right before that at 9, and then the holiday special at 10.  For No Reservations.  And if you want to see the edited sequence from...  There's sort of a missing sequence where the entire thing is on YouTube under... 
[02:56:00]  I don't know if you look up No Reservations and Krampus about the legend...  ...European sort of bad Santa figure.  You know, in Western Europe, there's not just Santa.  There's his evil associate Krampus.  So it's not like here where Krampus...  You know, where Santa says, you know, if you've been good, we'll give you presents.  If you've been bad, Krampus is coming, and he's going to beat the crap out of you,  shove you into a bag, and take you away forever.  Krampus rules.  Krampus rules.  We did a Krampus segment, and if you want to see the unedited version, it's up on YouTube. 
[02:56:30]  Right on.  Hey, it was a pleasure meeting you.  Yeah, you're an interesting guy, man.  Anthony Bourdain, it's No Reservations on Twitter, but we're focusing on the layover,  certainly, as well, on the Travel Channel, Mondays at 9 p.m.  Thank you, guys.  Come back and see you.  Oh, thank you.  Anthony Bourdain, everyone.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jimmy had a dream to the point he got up out of bed and started typing at 4.47.  Is it called typing even though you're on your computer? 
[02:57:00]  Sure.  The act is typing.  It's just not a great typewriter.  Right.  Oh.  And you wrote some notes about your dream.  I just, it's very disjointed, but it was a very bizarre dream, and I don't know exactly  what it was about.  It started, uh, before the dream, I was at, in Conan O'Brien's studio, and I didn't realize  that the stage was raised, so I went up one level, and I was trying to get on the stage  to see somebody I knew, but then the area was filled up with water, so I think I had 
[02:57:30]  to piss.  So, that had nothing to do with the dream.  What do you mean that had nothing to do with the dream?  I was, I don't know what happened.  Were you dreaming that?  Yeah, but then I was at, like, front, and I want to say-  How do you know that had nothing to do with the dream?  Because I remembered it after, but it was before.  And then I was at, like, Brewer's house or somebody's house, and, uh, the backyard was  flooded, and I, I kept trying to, like, there was a hose in the backyard, and I was very  thirsty.  I really wanted to drink out of the hose.  Yeah.  Which I hope isn't a fucking blowjob reference.  Yes!  You were thirsty all night.  I was very freaked out.  So here's the main dream. 
[02:58:00]  Um, I don't know what the event was, but George Bush Jr. and Bill Clinton were going to  be at the event, and I had access to them.  Wow.  And, um, I don't know how I remember, but I got a picture with Bill Clinton, and I was-  Uh-huh.  I met Bush, I was getting a picture with George Bush.  Yeah.  And he was friendly, but I handed my camera to a woman, and she was shaking so badly, and  the underside, she was pointing the underside of the camera, and I'm like, no!  Just completely fucking Jimmy's picture. 
[02:58:30]  And I'm like, no, no, no, turn it around, turn it around.  So she's shaking fucking violently.  And then we get the, uh, picture, and I remember I slapped Bush on the back, and I go, I knew  you'd be so much fun to meet and talk to, and he was very friendly.  And then, um, as we're done taking our picture, I noticed another guy walks around from behind  us, so I realized, I'm like, I hope he's not in my fucking picture with us.  Jimmy has these dreams about these picture anxiety things.  But I, I, so I look at the picture, and it's extremely pixelated and blurry, and we look 
[02:59:00]  like three homeboys.  It's like, I'm in the front, and George Bush is, you can kind of see him behind me, and  this other guy is behind him.  Oh, photo-bombed you.  But it looked like the actor who played fucking Charles Keating in the movie, I don't know  who that was in the Keating Lone and Scandal movie.  So I'm like, I have to get, the picture's very, very blurry, so I know I have to get another  copy of this picture.  And E-Rock is around, and he tells me that these guys are appearing at this other public place, 
[02:59:30]  and if I just wait there with E-Rock, he'll take me there.  But right now, he's going to, because he's going to help someone else get a picture with  the president.  So just stay there with E-Rock.  E-Rock's your go-to guy?  He's my go-to guy.  But I don't remember why, but I went back to an old location that I had been in earlier  in the dream to see if the presidents were there.  I got greedy, and this girl who I really liked was there, and she goes, no, they left,  you missed them.  Oh, no.  And she was hurt for some...  Why didn't you listen to E-Rock?  I don't know. 
[03:00:00]  But this girl was hurt.  She was injured.  And she asked to borrow some money for a cup of coffee.  She needed money for a coffee shop.  So I gave her 20.  I'm like, no, no, keep it.  You don't have to pay me back, because I wanted her to go out with me.  But I kept giving her my number and reading the digits, but she couldn't understand the  number.  Why don't you hate that?  I was like 7539, and I kept writing it, but I couldn't write it where she would read  it.  Jesus.  But then I realized I'm missing the president.  I realized I was wasting time here. 
[03:00:30]  I was wasting time with this dumb bitch.  So I panic, and I run back to the place.  It's the Sirius XM office.  But it's a giant open...  Like, you ever see the inside of a shopping mall with, like, an open-air vestibule and  all these shops around?  Yes.  That's what the office was like.  And Jim Brewer was there, and Keith Robinson was there.  And I'm like, where's E-Rock?  And they're all laughing at me.  Yeah, stupid, looking for E-Rock.  And they're all laughing at me because I'm trying to find Eric.  And I'm looking through my cell phone for fucking E-Rock's number, and I'm panicking. 
[03:01:00]  Because I look up E-Rock, and I realize I have him under Eric, and I just keep dialing the  wrong number, and I can't get fucking E-Rock.  Oh my God, this is so exhausting.  So I finally bump into Andrew Moss, who is our CFO, the Chief Financial Officer here,  who I know and I like.  And he's wearing a college sweatshirt, and he's bleeding from the lip, and he has blood  all over the front of his shirt.  Jeez.  I probably punched him.  No, he didn't look hurt.  He just had blood on the front of his shirt. 
[03:01:30]  But I knew him wearing a college sweatshirt, man.  He wasn't well-dressed anymore.  I missed the event.  And I go, like, is it happening?  Did I miss it?  He goes, no, no, but I think we're leaving.  He goes, the address is 5th and Beam.  5th and Beam.  So I have to get to 5th and Beam here in Manhattan, and I'm walking along, and I hear this old  lady driving by, yelling at the car, and a black guy I see in front of me.  She's like, it's him!  It's him!  He's the one.  I think he's on acid. 
[03:02:00]  But I'm like, I'm worried.  I'm worried that this was a tranny dream, because I'm writing it out, and I was rushing  this morning when I wrote it out.  I wrote it space him, but I put the S in the wrong place.  It was shim.  I'm like, oh my God, I hope this wasn't a female dream.  Shim.  Because I'm walking, and I know that this black guy's trouble, and I fucking, I know  that he's a problem, and I hear him walk around and start walking with the group I'm walking  with.  I don't know who they are.  And he starts to bother this girl that I'm walking with, and I'm like, I know I have 
[03:02:30]  to step in here and say something.  So I finally say something like, so leave her alone.  Stop bothering her.  And I punch this black guy in the face.  But he turns, and it's a tranny.  Oh, no.  But it's not a real face.  It's a doll face looking at me.  Oh, that's creepy.  It was a black plastic doll face.  And so I say, is anybody going to help me here?  Is anybody going to help me?  And this white guy's looking at me, and he's disinterested, and he walks away. 
[03:03:00]  So now I have to fight this person, but I also have to get downtown and see the president.  So I hop in a cab, and when I hop in a cab, Iraq comes over, and he's wearing a tuxedo.  And he looks in the window, and I know I've missed the event, because he's holding like  a fucking booklet that I know is from the event.  And he goes, what did he say to me?  He goes, oh, we were in the wrong place before.  And I know he's telling me, and I know he has photos with both presidents. 
[03:03:30]  And I know I've missed the event, because this asshole is smiling and beaming, and I'm  like, I should have just stuck with Iraq.  And so I get in the cab, and I tell the guy, we have to go to Fifth and Beam.  And he's running red lights for me.  And then I realize we're driving down suburban roads.  And this is the wrong place.  You're not in the city?  But now I wonder if it's a drinking dream, because Fifth and Beam, was I thinking Fifth  of Jim Beam?  Oh.  Or was that a drunk dream?  I don't know what that was.  And then I woke up.  That was my entire dream.  That is so fucked up. 
[03:04:00]  I like the detail of the plastic face.  The plastic doll face.  That's just how it feels scary.  With, like, girl doll hair.  And Iraq in his tuxedo.  And I knew that he had photos.  Oh, and Opie's mention was, I remember saying I wanted to tell George Bush that Opie has a  picture with Clinton, so I want to get a picture with both of you guys so I have a better  picture than Opie.  Like, I wanted to tell this to George Bush.  Wow.  That's a real thing between me and Jimmy.  I bust them all the time that I have a much better picture than he is.  But I wanted to tell the president, but it was fucking, the frustration of seeing this 
[03:04:30]  girl and, like, giving her 20.  It was so weird.  She had to go to the coffee shop and needed money.  But the frustration of not being heard by this woman, her not hearing.  It's all hookers.  It's a weird sex drinking dream deep down.  Yeah?  You think that was what it was?  I don't know what it means.  Coke Logic's got to animate the Jimmy dream.  I don't know what it means, but Iraq in his tuxedo, I knew that he had pictures with  the presidents, and I'm like, why didn't I just, it's almost like I feel like I'm missing  out on life by doing all this sexual shit, because I was trying to give this girl my 
[03:05:00]  number, and I gave her money, but meanwhile, I'm missing...  You're missing what you want to do.  The event.  I'm missing the event.  The big thing.  It really shook me when I woke up, though.  I couldn't go back to sleep.  I was really bothered.  That's weird, yeah.  Might mean nothing.  Yeah.  There's a lot of meaning in there.  I don't know.  Picture taking, and...  I think it's...  I don't know.  Are dreams really, like...  We're constantly chasing something that's just out of reach.  Do you look at dreams like that and get so deep into them, or are they very just surface-oriented 
[03:05:30]  synapse fucking snapping?  I think they're nonsense, because I think, first of all, you can't...  You know, when people read your dreams, it's stupid, because you don't even remember  all of the dream.  You only remember certain little, tiny little things.  Very, very rough.  That's pretty detailed, because you woke up and did that.  That is real good.  Yeah, because he was able to get out of bed.  Most people wouldn't get out of bed, and then they would try to tell someone what their  dream was about.  Yeah.  And then that person will go, well, I know exactly what's going on in your life because  of what you told me.  Stupid.  I try to just go right back to sleep and continue. 
[03:06:00]  I thought of that, too.  Yeah.  It never works.  Let me get out why I have this picture obsession.  I don't know if I talked about this, but I told you, and I wrote about it in Happy  Endings when I was a kid.  I had that crush on that girl who, like, I loved her, and I didn't know...  We got caught fooling around under the blanket, kissing, but I don't remember what happened.  But she was moving, and my parents were like, go say goodbye to her, go say goodbye to her,  and I couldn't say goodbye to her.  I couldn't do it.  I just froze in my house, and I looked at my clothes all folded, and I couldn't do it.  So I went down, and she had already left.  So I never saw her again after that. 
[03:06:30]  Never.  But I always wondered if, like, capturing these celebrity moments, it's almost like with  ex-girlfriends or whatever, I always keep them around, even as friends.  Like, I can't let go.  And it's almost like because I missed this fucking thing, I can't...  I have to capture it and fucking corral it and keep it.  Because I've never forgotten that moment of looking at those clothes.  And I joked about it in my book.  But seeing that fucking folded pile of clothes and not being able to get dressed, not being  able to move myself and go say goodbye to that girl. 
[03:07:00]  Why couldn't you?  Like, why couldn't you?  I just...  I couldn't...  It was too sad?  It was if I don't acknowledge it, it won't be true.  Yeah.  I couldn't...  How old were you?  Maybe five or six.  It was a puppy love crush thing.  It wasn't sexual.  It was like...  I don't remember her name or what she looked like.  But we've talked about this.  That's hardcore sex for a five-year-old.  It's that same emotion.  Yeah.  Same intensity.  Not having sex as a five-year-old, but that's...  It's the same type of shit in your head, though.  Oh, yeah.  I think I was... 
[03:07:30]  I was really in love with someone.  Hanging around with exes.  Get the fuck out of here.  No, but not even hanging around with them.  But just knowing that I can occasionally...  Nah.  ...corral them.  Even as friends, like...  I don't want to fuck them.  I don't fuck my ex-girlfriends, ever.  But just having them around still in some way?  Fuck that.  But there's one from ten years ago who I think is mad at me and she won't talk to me anymore.  Yeah.  And I don't know why.  But I'm like, I'm curious.  Like, how is she doing?  I don't want to date her.  I don't want to fuck her.  But I just want to know how she is.  I don't know why I can't just go fuck these people and put them out of my life anymore. 
[03:08:00]  Like, why do I have to capture every moment on...  It's almost like if I meet these celebrities, I don't bother them.  I really don't want to go hang out with them.  I don't...  Cole, I have fucking some of their numbers.  I have fucking Omar's number.  Jamie Hector.  I've texted them a couple of times.  Okay, if you want to come down to the cellar.  But not incessantly.  I don't need them in my life being best friends.  I don't try to overtake their lives.  Why do I corral these fucking moments?  Yeah, but some of those guys want to be friends with you.  Some of them do.  Just on a real level, too, by the way. 
[03:08:30]  Not because, you know, you're famous and he's famous.  I think some of them might want to.  You know, we're brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  This is After Open Anthony Live.  And my name is Sam Roberts.  Great show today. 
[03:09:00]  That last bit sounded a little familiar.  But other than that, fantastic show today.  Anthony Bourdain was in here.  He was talking about his new show, The Layover.  It's like No Reservations.  Everybody loves Anthony Bourdain.  I've never met anybody who knows who Anthony Bourdain is who doesn't love the guy.  It's like No Reservations.  It's called The Layover.  And it's more, it's no reservations but in areas that you might find yourself. 
[03:09:30]  Okay, so the episode that we were sent was Miami.  He said he's filmed in New York, Rome.  And it's just 24 to 48 hours in these cities.  And where's there to eat?  What's there to do?  Iraq, you're a foodie.  How does Anthony Bourdain compare with the other TV chefs?  Sorry, Troy was asking me something for the weekend.  What was Troy asking you?  Oh, just going over promo stuff.  Oh. 
[03:10:00]  Does Troy not realize you have a job right now?  I didn't know you were talking to me when Troy came in.  Well, you're supposed to be producing, you're the producer of After Open Anthony Live, right?  I'm your board op.  Well, still.  You know, you're not my board op, B-O-R-E-D.  You're my board op.  So I need you here with me.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm here.  Okay.  How does Anthony Bourdain compare to the other TV chefs?  See, I'm not into all those other, you'd think, with me and food.  I don't care about those damn cooking shows and all the other chef stuff like Gordon Ramsay.  Well, what do you jerk off to then? 
[03:10:30]  Stop.  But I do like Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations.  I haven't seen the layover yet.  Well, it's like, well, I just said it, but you weren't listening.  Everybody else was.  It's similar to No Reservations, but in places where you might go.  So the thing about Anthony Bourdain's shows, though, they don't fit on the Travel Channel.  They don't fit on Food Network.  Food Network is a very sort of middle of the road.  We're not going to offend anybody.  We're going to make all the housewives happy.  And if you're not in a restaurant setting, they have a fake kitchen set that you have to be on. 
[03:11:00]  It's all very sort of, it's very kosher.  You know what I mean?  It's very safe.  Anthony Bourdain is not a safe guy.  He jumped in a car on the Miami episode, and he rented a sports car and said that it's important when you come to Miami to channel your inner douchebag and things like this.  And he's pointing out girls' asses as they walk down the street.  He's cursing.  He's drinking.  He's sucking.  He's fucking.  He's everything that you want.  I don't think he's, you know, sucking. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  He didn't do it on the show that I saw.  He didn't do either of those two things.  So follow me on that.  But what I also like about Anthony Bourdain, especially with No Reservations, it's like he has really unusual celebrity friends that just show up depending on the city.  Like the one he did in Chicago with Bill and Bill Murray just shows up.  Bill Murray never does anything.  It's just because there's something about Anthony Bourdain.  I mean, the fact that maybe he's one of the three honest people in all of television, but there's something about him that people love him. 
[03:12:00]  They don't like him.  They love him.  And they want to do projects with him.  Yeah, I think I said in Chicago it was in New York when Bill Murray showed up.  But still, Bill Murray doesn't.  Eric, nobody's calling you on Anthony Bourdain trivia today.  But Bill Murray doesn't.  You see him on Letterman, and that's about it.  He never shows up anywhere.  You barely see him on that.  He doesn't do shows anymore.  But, you know, Anthony Bourdain is the show to do.  He's the show.  If you're friends with him.  And if you haven't heard it, I think we've aired it.  I believe we have aired it on this channel.  But Joe Rogan's podcast, when he got Anthony Bourdain to come on, is a great listen to as well. 
[03:12:30]  Joe Rogan's podcast is always a great listen to.  For everybody who's asking, I don't know what Jim was talking about earlier today.  He said, you know, right before Anthony Bourdain came in, it did get a little hostile in here.  I'm not going to lie about that.  It got a little – I wasn't quite sure where it was going.  It started with Opie bringing up his mom.  And trust me, ladies and gentlemen.  That never goes well.  I know that I'm going to have to pay for the things that I said today very dearly. 
[03:13:00]  But why?  Yeah, I mean, look.  Of all the things that he said about your mom and to your mom, I mean, that was a small portion of giving it back to him.  Well, that's why.  He was sitting here and he was being revealing about an experience he had with his mother.  And all I could picture in my head was Mrs. Roberts, Sam's mommy, saying, go get him, Sam.  Defend my honor.  Don't let him get away with it again. 
[03:13:30]  Was she appearing like a little ghost over your shoulder there?  No, she was in the front of my forehead.  She was in my head.  She wasn't on my shoulders.  She was at my forefront.  She was looking me right in the eyes and telling me exactly what I should be doing.  Go for it.  Go for it, Sammy.  Go for the knockout.  And I went for it.  And, yeah, I mean, look, if you're talking about what should happen, like, between two people,  I shouldn't have to worry about the horrible ramifications that doing that is going to include. 
[03:14:00]  The terrible things that are going to happen to me because I made some jokes about Opie's mom today and her relationship with an old man.  But we're not talking about just people.  You know, I can't say, well, you made fun of my mom, so I get to make fun of your mom because Opie holds the trump card.  He gets to say, yeah, except I'm Opie.  That's my name on the wall.  All right.  And you don't get to do that because there's a cost to pay. 
[03:14:30]  All right, fair enough.  But I think, you know, with him calling your mom the C word, you evened it out by saying, does the old man come dust into your mother?  Into her mouth, I said.  Not just into her.  That would have been classless.  I asked him, you know, into her mouth, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  No, I think it just makes it even.  It's a wash.  My fiance is texting me right now.  I guess she's listening to the after show asking what I did. 
[03:15:00]  But for those of you that weren't listening, Opie brought up – no, she's listening to the show.  We're on the radio right now, Eric.  There are people listening, and I know that you aren't as experienced at this as I am, but that's what happens sometimes.  I'm admiring the lights in here.  I know.  They're very distracting, aren't they?  What happened was Opie brought up his mom, for those that didn't hear, and said that she had a crush on an older man.  And she mentioned that she met an older man in an assisted living home. 
[03:15:30]  She's 75.  He was 92.  And she said she liked this old man and that he had a great body.  This 92-year-old man had a great body.  So I took that opportunity to get very sexual with the line of questioning that I followed with Opie, as he has done to my mother in the past.  I felt he deserved it, and I feel very strong in my conviction to do that to him.  Unfortunately, my mother, the next time she's on the show, is going to be the one who suffers from that. 
[03:16:00]  She's the one who's going to have to pay the cost, not me.  I mean, I'll have a bit of embarrassment because I need to defend mommy, but –  Well, it's going to cost her a lot of baked goods.  She's not – I told her not to put up with that bullshit anymore.  Or that – she brings in baked goods, right?  And that day, everything is fine.  But she should know by now that the next day, it's just going to be shit on it again.  You know what I mean?  You can't just keep bringing in baked goods.  It's like giving a bully your lunch money. 
[03:16:30]  He'll leave you alone if you give it to him on Monday.  But guess what?  You owe him some money Tuesday through Friday.  You know what I'm saying?  You have to learn from these things.  Matt the intern – listen, Fred.  Matt the intern, I saw it in his face.  He had something to say.  Fred, should – this is UCB Fred from the Ryan Fez show.  Yes.  Should I let Matt the intern just say what he wanted to say just real quick?  I can't imagine that he has anything to add.  You don't think so, UCB Fred from Ryan Fez.  Say go with your instincts. 
[03:17:00]  I don't know.  Matt, should I let you say something?  Yeah.  Okay.  He says yes.  Eric.  What?  You're the intern boss.  Yeah.  The people now may be curious.  Should I let intern Matt say what he had to say?  Well, he only has a few days left, so you might as well just hear what nonsense he's  going to spew.  Okay.  You're right.  UCB Fred.  Eric said he's only got a few days left.  So maybe hear whatever nonsense he's got to spew.  I am – sure.  Go ahead.  All right.  Well, Sam, there's quite a buzz going on in the Twitterverse today. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, he's doing this.  I'm not sure if you're aware of this.  There's a bit of a controversy because apparently a couple of listeners have informed Bobo that  he's not allowed at the FH Reilly's party on Saturday.  This is insane.  And there's actually been a security force assembled to keep Bobo out of FH Reilly's,  and there's been an account created called at Bobo Security to keep Bobo out of FH Reilly's.  I don't know.  If Matt wasn't hated enough already, Matt uses his one opportunity to come on the air 
[03:18:00]  and talk about Bobo.  Well, I'm just telling you that –  Matt, it's just a combination of the two most hated things.  Are you going to call Jordan next on the phone and just bring together –  We both called today, and I told them we don't care about this.  We have Anthony Bourdain on.  I saw Jordan was on the phone for a while.  Yeah, and then –  Jordan called in yesterday and was on hold all day.  Well, that's his problem.  Bobo was –  Jordan the karaoke star, for those that don't know.  Bobo was very angry this morning.  I don't care about Bobo, Matt.  What do I care about Bobo? 
[03:18:30]  Why would I care?  What are we talking about Bobo for?  I just think you should be aware of what's going on in the Twitterverse.  Nobody cares.  Let's bring in real quick.  Steve, get Steve in here.  Get Pitbull Steve Sturniolo because Steve –  I don't know if you know about this, UCB Fred,  but Steve Sturniolo is a bit of a Pitbull.  Yeah.  When –  I was just telling the audience, you're a bit of a Pitbull.  On the after show here, you tell me if this is a wise choice by Matt, okay?  He's a piece of garbage.  Okay, before we go there. 
[03:19:00]  I love you, though.  Steve Sturniolo from Raw Dog.  Piece of human filth.  I bring him in, right?  Yeah.  And I go around the room because I know maybe I shouldn't be doing this,  but his eyes lit up.  I thought he had – I knew he had something to say.  And since they lit up while I was talking, I thought they might be relevant about what  I was saying.  This was mistake one.  You're an idiot.  I know.  I'm very stupid sometimes.  I don't know what I'm doing here.  Then he comes on the air.  Now, you know Matt, the intern, very hated here on the show. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I'm talking amongst the audience.  They just can't stand the guy.  And the office.  And the office hates him, too?  I mean, holy shit.  That's not true.  Everyone hates this kid.  You don't even work for the channel.  I don't hate him.  Like, I look at him and go, man, I hate you.  Okay, so you do.  But he's fun to, like, laugh at.  And, like, he doesn't do work here.  Like, he just, like, makes flyers for shit he wants to do.  I remember you saying that.  He talks to some chick all day.  And I'm pretty sure she hates him, too.  She does?  I think so.  I think that girl hates you.  Which one?  I don't know.  It's a block of hair girl.  She's another intern.  I can't really talk about that.  I can only talk about how much you suck.  I'm not going to talk about how much she sucks. 
[03:20:00]  That's right.  Steve Sturneolica.  She's not here.  Then Matt comes on the air.  And he starts talking about what's going on in Bobo's life, of all things.  Why would he ever?  I mean, do you think this is a wise move?  Matt's got one opportunity.  He talks about Bobo.  No.  It's the two most hated things.  I mean, it's one of my most loved things about the show.  But why would you?  I was listening, Sam.  I got off the air and I started listening to you.  And all I heard was,  Iraq, do I let him speak?  Should I let him speak? 
[03:20:30]  And I was like, oh God, what's he going to say?  But I had to vacate the studio.  So I'm here.  You did the right thing.  You did the right thing.  What did you say about Bobo?  No, no, no.  Don't you dare repeat it.  Why?  Was it like show?  Was it stuff for like open listening?  It was so uninteresting.  Oh, okay.  It was not anything.  But it was important.  No, it had no relevance to anything.  It had nothing to do with the show.  And I wish it had never been said.  And that's why I'm going to insist that he does not repeat it.  This show replays.  So if you're really curious tonight at like whatever, 7, 15-ish. 
[03:21:00]  Not that curious.  Right.  I'm good.  Does this kid hate him too?  Yeah, UCB Fred.  Holy shit.  This kid hates you?  UCB Fred loves me.  Oh, you hate him?  Oh, yeah.  He's great.  No, that's not that thing.  I know Sal fucking despises him.  And I don't want him to talk unless you want him to.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  Sal's allowed.  I'm sorry for just coming in here unannounced.  But I just wanted to say one line.  I'm out of here.  See, this is.  Look at this attitude.  He goes, I'm sorry for just coming in unannounced.  Just real quick.  I just want to say.  And then he'll leave.  Whereas Matt is like. 
[03:21:30]  And wow, he added a lot.  I'm sure that you guys want to talk.  You added.  You're a fucking waste of shit.  Oh, my God.  Look at you.  But like I said, like I said, eight days.  And he's gone.  You know what?  For all the fans out there, eight days.  And he's gone.  That added more than you did.  And you.  Just because you said more than one line that he spent 20 minutes coming up with.  I hope this kid breaks his ankle when he leaves the building.  You do.  But I will stand on his side on this.  Doesn't he bring more to Opie and Anthony and the after show being just the worst.  Like, granted, it's not his job. 
[03:22:00]  It's not his job.  His job is to intern.  But him being such a waste of human shit.  I mean, this kid is just the worst human being I've ever met.  The problem is that Matt goes.  It's a piece of garbage.  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, you're awful.  Yeah, yeah.  No, Steve's right on this one.  You're terrible.  The problem with Matt is that he's one dimensional.  Yeah.  And so it's just.  Yeah.  This kid sucks.  And it's like.  But it's to the point where people are like, you know what?  I can't listen.  Well.  And that's the day.  You have to tread the line of.  Oh, I can't stand this guy, but I can't stop listening. 
[03:22:30]  Whereas I can't stand this guy.  I'm going to stop listening now.  Well, Sal's also.  That's what you don't want.  Sal's also one dimensional.  He's always awesome.  Like, he's always really good at what he does.  Like, he always succeeds.  Like, he never fails where you always fail.  Brian.  Brian in Long Island wants to contribute to After Open Anthony Live today.  So, Brian.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah.  By putting him on and you talking about him, that's all he wants.  Yeah.  He doesn't care who the fuck he's talking about.  He's an attention cunt. 
[03:23:00]  So, what do I do?  He's shit.  Kick him in the face.  Well, I can't kick him in the face.  I don't think he's allowed to do that.  I'm really...  I'm not...  Is there any...  Tell me where he comes out of the building.  Okay.  Okay.  So, then you'll kick him in the face.  Can we talk about Matt when he doesn't have a...  Like, I don't want...  Like, why is my...  Matt has weaseled his way onto your after show.  Should we get him out of here?  I mean, I would.  I mean, you could kick me out at any time.  You'd call me in to just tell what I thought about Matt.  You're the pit bull.  Yeah, you could...  Well, he's a piece of shit.  Okay.  See, I look at him.  I don't know if I like that kind of talk.  I don't like the guy like you, but I love you at the same time. 
[03:23:30]  I'm your favorite intern ever.  You're my favorite intern as long as you're never interning for me.  Ever.  Okay.  But favorite intern ever.  You're useless.  Okay.  On that note, I guess that'll be your swan song for today.  Okay.  You're dismissed.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  You're dismissed.  Me too.  Do you want me dismissed?  Sam and Steve show?  You got anything to plug?  What are we doing?  Because we are doing something together.  I just don't know when it's on.  We're going to interview Anthony Bourdain today.  The same guy who was on the Opie and Anthony show.  We were just talking about how awesome he was.  We've kind of...  We're weaseling our way into Raw Dog, and I guess eventually we'll get yelled at, but 
[03:24:00]  I'm just going to keep scheduling interviews for us, and then we're going to keep doing  them, and then Troy Kwan's going to make us an open.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  So this started...  We're going to freelance Troy Kwan on the weekends to make us an opening.  This is Steve Sterniolo from Raw Dog, and...  He and I...  We interviewed Nick Swartzen together, because Steve was like, hey, Sam...  Why don't you sit in?  Because I do a show.  Why don't you sit in?  Sit in.  I'm going to interview him.  I want it to sound a little different, so, you know, why don't we do this?  I go, okay.  We interviewed him, and now you're just booking guests. 
[03:24:30]  I'm just booking guests.  For both...  And I love it.  Yeah.  But you're also going to have Troy...  We're going to just...  Because this is the idea.  So my bosses at Raw Dog enjoyed you and I interviewing someone.  They said, that was pretty funny.  If you guys want to, you can continue to interview together.  He's like, or you can just do your show by yourself, whatever you want.  So I like to do interviews with Sam.  So I started booking him, and then to really put it in their head, because the talent people  are a bunch of dirtbags here.  You think so?  Because they go, oh, uh, uh, that's not a show.  I'm not booking that.  Who says that? 
[03:25:00]  Liam.  Liam.  Liam.  I mean, what a piece of garbage.  Talent booker Liam.  You're not talking about...  Because Spencer...  Spencer is great.  Roland is great.  Roland is...  I mean, you have to say Roland's great.  He'll light something of yours on fire.  Yeah, he's just a vindictive bastard.  Very vindictive.  He's angry.  But, uh...  Yeah, so Liam's kind of a scum.  Liam's giving you nothing but trouble.  Well, McFoley's coming in, we think.  I love McFoley.  Yeah.  And, uh, oh, Sam, a huge McFoley fan.  Sam, even on that one, I would go, Sam, why don't you take the lead, pal?  Because you know, and if I feel like jumping in, I'll jump in.  But why don't you just do a good... 
[03:25:30]  Matt, you have no need...  He had no need to be in here.  Get away!  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  Get out of here.  Dirtbag.  Okay, so then...  So, uh, yeah, so McFoley's coming in, and Liam goes, I can't book him for you.  I go, why not?  He goes, well, that's not a show.  I'm not booking him for this imaginary show.  I go, I'm telling you, it's a fucking show, Liam.  Well, Anthony Bourdain's not gonna be talking to two empty chairs.  Yeah, Anthony Bourdain's gonna be talking to Steve and Sam.  Yeah.  And then, you know, we'll see what happens, and maybe one day it'll be Sam and Steve.  So when...  Yeah, well, I'm gonna just keep working. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, you're trying.  I'm gonna keep climbing up that ladder.  Uh, when...  I will know by the end of today, so then I'll let you know, and then you can plug it on the  after a show tomorrow.  Okay.  I think it's gonna be on tomorrow afternoon at some point.  That sounds terrific.  But it'll be on before the weekend, pal.  Uh, Steve Sterniolo, thank you for coming in here and pitbulling.  Every now and then, when I need a pitbull, I think I'm gonna call on you.  I like...  I'll...  This is...  This is fun.  Yeah, you like this.  Like, being able just to destroy Matt verbally, and now I'm just gonna see him in the office  and go, hey, Matt, how are you?  And just walk by him.  Plus, then it's like, if bosses are like, you can't really shit on the interns like that, 
[03:26:30]  I'm gonna be like, I don't know what's...  Sterniolo's a loose cannon, and we can't control him.  Yeah, he's wild.  He's crazy.  By the way, just one last thing before I go, E-Rock really hates him.  Because I could see E-Rock, as we were just yelling at Matt, was just dying laughing in  that other room.  Like, he was loving Matt's ripping.  And now E-Rock's gone.  I just see an empty mic.  Does he just...  He does that sometimes.  He's not someone you can count on for anything.  Thanks, Sam.  See you at 11, pal.  Thank you very much, Steve Sterniolo.  This is a good question.  Andy in Pittsburgh. 
[03:27:00]  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  Thanks for having me on the Steve and Sam show.  That's my pleasure, Andy.  Hey, I wanted to ask you, who do you think would make a better intern, Bobo or Matt?  A better intern?  Yes.  In terms of getting...  In terms of producing content for the show and being like a good worker.  Yes.  And being...  The sideshow and all the shenanigans.  In terms of like intelligence and all that, I would have to say Bobo.  Daniel Bobo Curlin would probably be better.  Yeah, I think so. 
[03:27:30]  Well, he'd be reliable.  He would.  At least he would be here, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you can count on it.  Hey, thanks for having me on.  Thank you, Andy.  Can I just say something?  Yeah, of course you can, UCB, Fred.  I just want to say that, yeah, I would have to choose Bobo, too.  Because the thing about Matt is that he's insolent.  Bobo would never, like, say, no, I'm not going to do this.  Right.  Which I've seen Matt do.  Right.  On occasion.  And he's like, fuck you guys.  Bobo would be like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I stare at disbelief when, you know, Eric or Sal asks something of him. 
[03:28:00]  He goes, oh, I don't feel like it.  The disrespect is like.  It's like, why would you say that?  I like you.  Why couldn't we have you and Ron and Fez get Matt the intern?  You're not an O&A fan, huh?  No, I love O&A.  I just don't like waking up really early.  Okay.  Well, that's honest.  I guess that's a problem.  All right.  What?  You got to be fucking kidding me.  Just in response to UCB Fred.  That's never happened. 
[03:28:30]  I've never once been in subordinate.  I've seen you do it.  I've yelled at you about doing it to E-Rock.  You're disrespectful all the time.  Get out of here.  It's not true.  You're being disrespectful right now.  I dismissed you.  Go.  I just had to put that.  Go.  Thank you.  How many times have we were going to leave the office?  It's like two or three o'clock.  We're done.  You're leaving.  I'm leaving.  Troy's leaving.  He's still here.  And I say, go home.  Okay.  And then he's wandering around again.  Of course he is.  It's like, I thought you left.  Oh, I'm going to go a little bit.  It's just so irritating.  Other than taking his stuff and throwing it into the elevator and pointing, he doesn't 
[03:29:00]  listen.  You never do.  Is that what you have to do?  Oh, I was so close once.  Well, you probably-  I had it in my hand.  I'm like, I'm going to throw this in the elevator.  You probably can't do that.  No, I don't.  You probably can't.  I don't want to take any more Matt calls.  I'll talk about this, Eric.  Yeah.  Well, line one's not a Matt call, but it's all right.  Yeah, we were talking about Opie's mom a minute ago.  What's up, Keith?  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  What's up, fellas? 
[03:29:30]  Can you imagine if that old guy, because, you know, they lose their hearing and their vision.  Imagine if he's trying to tag Opie's mom and he asks, and he reaches on the nightstand  and he grabs a Paladin instead of the KY.  Listen, Opie's mom and Opie aren't even here to defend themselves anymore, Keith.  We have to draw the line somewhere, don't we?  Yeah, in our ass.  Thank you, Keith.  Jeez.  Horrible.  Eric, for the record, you're on tape recommending that I take that call.  No, I just said that's not a call about Matt.  I know what you're after.  Eric figures, oh, maybe I'll get a little Opie payback in here. 
[03:30:00]  I'm not saying shit.  Let's move on to a brighter note.  And by brighter note, I mean so bright that you'll think it's a precious metal.  As a matter of fact, it is a precious metal.  Get out.  It's a type of silver.  It's called Argentium.  Yes, Argentium, ladies and gentlemen.  Is he really sticking with this bed?  I guess so.  This is the music that he wants played?  Yeah.  Look, I know people don't get the I hate Steven Singer tagline,  but people really don't get this music being played. 
[03:30:30]  Regardless, it's his choice, you know what I mean?  But look, at least I got it right to the part where it kicks in.  I could start it over from the long intro.  No, I wouldn't like that at all.  What I like are the things that I can get at Steven Singer Jewelers.  Whether it's Argentium, the king of all silver metals.  We're talking about a silver that's brighter than platinum,  brighter than sterling, brighter than white gold,  tarnish resistant, it's responsible, it's ethical. 
[03:31:00]  It's made from recycled silver.  It's stuff that it's taking old silver and turning it new again.  Okay, it's saving the planet and doing it in a way that's better than any silver ever could.  Head on down to the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  I mean, this is a guy who puts you through the experience.  I went to get an engagement ring, and his guy, Turbo Joe, made me a diamond expert.  I could teach a class on these goddamn stones. 
[03:31:30]  I'm so well versed.  Check him out.  I hate Steven Singer dot com.  365 days a year.  It's free shipping.  Okay.  And there's a money-back guarantee.  You'll never use it.  1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER is the phone number.  IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER dot com is the website.  And his store.  He's got a whole store.  It's located on the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  And if you try to rob him, he will cave in your chest with a shotgun. 
[03:32:00]  I've seen him do it to one guy before, and he's not afraid to do it again.  But you know what?  His prices are so low, you'll feel like you're robbing him.  Everybody leaves happy.  It's amazing.  I HATE-STEVEN-SINGER dot com.  Well, the guy with the shotgun didn't leave happy.  No.  He was really upset about the way everything turned out.  There's something in me.  Eric, I need advice again.  Oh, no.  Bobo's on the phone.  Okay.  Do I pick it up?  UCB Fred!  I go to you first. 
[03:32:30]  Sorry, Eric.  That's all right.  Why don't I go to UCB Fred from Ron and Fez first?  Well, the instinct before was not to let Matt talk.  Correct.  And I would say, I don't know.  I don't know about Bobo.  So far, you've been the voice of reason, Eric.  Well, we could talk about Joe Rogan being on the show today.  Bobo!  Welcome to After Opie and Anthony Live!  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't...  Is he doing his voice?  Why are you here?  I was here.  You guys were talking about me and wanting me to call in.  Nobody said that! 
[03:33:00]  Why would I...  No.  Nobody said, please, Bobo, call in.  That would be great.  I was not home, and I left my phone at home accidentally.  Nobody rang it.  Nobody called it.  Yeah, well, I got a word.  I don't know.  One of my friends who's also listening was telling me...  Who told you?  Was it Kurt Love?  Yeah, it was my friend Kurt Love.  Bobo has one friend, ladies and gentlemen.  That one friend is named Kurt Love.  Kurt Love is a super fan of the show. 
[03:33:30]  He's at all the live events.  He's at everything.  We love seeing Kurt Love.  Bobo and Kurt Love at one point had a romantic relationship.  That one, Bobo and his brother?  That's right.  The romantic relationship has since fizzled, but the two have remained friends.  Bobo, it's really nice that you two were able to have that special relationship and  then, you know, maintain a friendship afterwards.  That's right.  A lot of people find that very difficult to do.  That's right, UCB Fred.  But, um, there's Travis.  Come on in, Travis.  Yeah, you. 
[03:34:00]  Not that...  Did you hear who's on the phone?  Who's on the phone?  Bobo's on the phone, Travis.  I know you like talking to Bobo.  He was told to call in.  Who told Bobo to call in?  His former lover and now best friend, Kurt Love.  Aww.  This is, uh...  It's good that they keep in touch.  See, Bobo, I picked up the phone and said, hey, this is Bobo.  Yeah, I heard you wanted to talk to me.  Nobody said that.  I've been listening to the after show.  No, no, he said we said on the air for him to call in.  Yeah, you're all right.  I was not even home.  My phone was left at home. 
[03:34:30]  Where are you going?  No, I went to a doctor's appointment.  For what?  Your honor?  And I came home and I noticed that...  You noticed what?  No, that Kurt Love was trying to call me.  I noticed there was a...  Why did you call Kurt Love then?  Why would you call me?  Hang on.  I found out who told him to call.  He just said Kurt Love.  Not only Kurt Love.  Who else?  There's a tweet from intern Matt telling Bobo to call.  Did intern Matt tell you to call Bobo?  It says one hour ago. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't read the tweet.  I didn't read that tweet.  Eric, I need this to be done.  I'm okay with Matt's voice off the air.  Ask intern Matt why he would...  First of all, why is he tweeting while the show is on, especially for stuff like that?  And second of all, why...  If he didn't do it for the after show, he did it for the main show, which is even worse.  If that was an hour ago, it would have been 9.30.  Yeah, which is worse.  Why is he tweeting Bobo telling him to call the show? 
[03:35:30]  Well, one, I thought it would be a good thing for the show.  The whole thing I was talking about, the Bulbo security.  And two...  Okay, listen.  Somebody has to explain to Matt the difference between being a producer and being an intern.  That is not, you can't, under no circumstance can Matt ever think something would be good for the show.  Can Matt ever think, can Matt ever think that something is good for the show and just go ahead and do it. 
[03:36:00]  Matt, you always, always have to ask your intern boss, who once again, I will say, has acted somewhat irresponsibly, the sex man, whether or not...  Irresponsibly for what?  That he does shit without telling me?  Yeah, you've got to keep an eye on this kid.  Okay, I'll stop looking at the regular show and follow him and see what he does.  Well, you're the intern boss.  I don't care.  What do you mean you don't care?  That's your job.  Not during the live show, it's not.  Yes, during the live show. 
[03:36:30]  Isn't that when the interns are working?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  During the live show?  Eric, last time you and Troy had an argument off the air, you said that you were not responsible for being the intern boss after 11.  Okay, and now you're saying you're not responsible for being the intern boss?  No, I'm not responsible for following him around and see what he's doing during the live show.  Well, you know what?  If you can't control him, you are.  You know?  There's a fine line between babysitter and intern boss, and sometimes that line has to be crossed.  Yeah, I'm not babysitting.  Sorry.  Why can't you shape up Matt in his few days he has remaining into an ideal intern? 
[03:37:00]  You haven't been able to do it all semester.  Why can't you make...  Because now he's completely out of control.  Now he's tweeting Bobo, telling him to call the show because he thinks something that doesn't even work for the after show will work on the main show.  When he should know that it wouldn't work, because Opie doesn't like having Matt on the air, and Opie hates having Bobo on the air.  So, and Bobo, that's no offense to you. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  Well, anyway, the whole...  But this was just about some old stupid situation, something that Steve from Bayshore must have been making up.  Steve from Bayshore, man?  Not being able to go to FH.  I don't know anything.  I'm hanging up.  I don't want to hear anything more about it.  Look.  FH...  I hung up on Bobo.  FH Riley's is a great restaurant.  I don't want to hear anything else about Bobo and his FH Riley's party.  Go to FH Riley's anytime you get a chance, but I don't want to hear about Bobo going there.  Um, what are we going to do, Eric? 
[03:38:00]  What are you...  How are you going to shape up your intern?  I'm not.  He's got a few days left.  I wish I could get rid of him now, but I can't.  But we're going to have to deal with him for...  We didn't...  Sal say eight days, eight shows we have to deal with him?  Uh, yeah, the...  What's his name?  Yep.  To the 16th.  So, what is...  The 16th is next Friday, so that's six shows.  Six more shows.  Well, how...  How are we going to get through those six shows if there is somebody who's sabotaging them?  Your intern is going past the point of being a bad intern and now sabotage. 
[03:38:30]  I wish I could do what I really want to do.  No, I know you do, buddy.  I know what you want to do, and you can't do it.  You have to overcome this stuff.  Six more shows.  You have to make it...  You have to make him a good intern.  No, I don't have to do shit with him anymore now.  No, yes you do.  No, I don't.  Six more shows.  No.  You refuse to even try to make him a good intern.  I can't.  I don't like that. 
[03:39:00]  There's too much riding on this.  There's no such thing as I can't.  There's I won't.  That's what I'm hearing from you.  But there is no I can't.  No, there's a difference between I can and I won't.  I'm aware of that.  But there's some things where I can't, and there's some things that I won't.  And this is a situation where I can't.  I don't believe that.  There's nothing, Eric Nagel.  There is nothing that you can't do.  What would your family in Florida, in your old house that you grew up in... 
[03:39:30]  On Long Island?  No, no, no.  I'm not from Florida.  What would they say if they found out that the old Florida boy, Eric Nagel, was saying,  I can't?  They would say, pick yourself up by your Floridian bootstraps, Eric.  You can do this.  You can make intern Matt a great intern.  Nope.  That I won't.  He's a lost cause.  That's horrible.  And you know what?  I hope you never become a father. 
[03:40:00]  That's horrible.  Well, I'm just saying because you're not a good leader.  You're not a good father.  I see Matt as your son at work.  I see Matt as pretty much your child.  And he's somebody that you're raising in your own image.  And that is why you need to be there for your child.  No.  If he was my kid, I'd abandon him.  You would.  Yeah.  That's why I'm worried about you being a parent.  No.  For my own kid, I'd be fine.  You can't put...  You had to have Matt here, leaving him, rest stop, and then driving away. 
[03:40:30]  How old is Matt?  Who cares?  Stop talking about him.  You can't put a 20-something year old in a basket and leave him at somebody's doorstep.  It's too old.  No, leave him at a rest stop.  He'd find you, Eric.  He has a driver's license.  Cripple him.  Now you're being ridiculous.  Now you're just being goofy.  No, I just...  Enough with him.  I can't fucking take it because he goes and it's been addressed as much as I could.  But he just goes and does shit that he wants to do. 
[03:41:00]  Coke Logic has a great idea.  Okay?  You love My Fair Lady.  It's your favorite movie.  I don't know My Fair Lady.  I don't...  Sexy is what he's saying, and he spelled it right.  Sex with the E.  Yeah.  Sexy should turn Matt into the best intern by next Friday, like My Fair Lady.  This...  A week from tomorrow, Matt comes in here as the best intern we've ever had.  Matt, can you do it?  I can do it.  I'm ready.  Eric!  What?  The challenge has been laid out next Friday. 
[03:41:30]  Nope.  Oh, come on.  What do you mean no?  Come on, Eric.  I'd rather him go missing by next Friday.  No, no.  We're going to do this.  We're going to do this.  Why can't you make him good, Eric?  He's beyond help.  I don't want to deal with him anymore.  Matt's motivated to change.  Yes.  Now all he needs is a real teacher.  And that's you.  No, that's you.  No, I wasn't...  You want to take him?  You think he's fixable?  You take him.  I'm not allowed to.  You forget these things.  That's one of those I can't situations.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not allowed to is a different thing than I can't.  That is an I can't.  You're not allowed.  You can't.  I'm physically able to.  But I will get in trouble if I do.  That is true.  You are the leader of the interns.  You can't just take the good ones.  Yes, I can.  You got to take the bad ones and turn them into good ones.  That's what this program is all about.  Remember Love Buzz?  He came in here.  I didn't pick Love Buzz.  No, he was a lost cause.  But by the time he left this internship program, he was one of the best we ever had.  Was he not?  No, I don't think so.  He wasn't?  On the air, he was fantastic. 
[03:42:30]  But as a worker, no.  He wasn't great.  No.  But on the air, he was amazing.  Remember Cream Pie Jones?  Another intern we had.  He was a disaster when he walked in here.  By the time his semester was up, he walked out of here a new man.  He was a great intern.  Don't you think that is the truth?  No, because Matt has no...  Troy.  Matt has nothing to bring, even if he's fucking up.  There's nothing fun with him.  It's obvious what we need to do here.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Eric is the boss of the interns.  So he said, I mean, so we've heard.  So we've been told.  Yeah.  I see that as a father to the interns.  Yeah.  And the interns are his kids.  Yeah.  You can't abandon your kids ever.  No matter how shitty they get.  It's just not something a father does.  I am telling Eric, Matt's last day is Friday.  Why can't Eric bring Matt in here as the greatest intern we've ever had by Friday?  Why can't he change this kid?  That's tall order. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I know.  But Eric's up for the job.  Is he?  No, he's not.  Eric, don't downplay yourself, okay?  Nobody likes self-deprecating humor.  It's so past that.  There's no desire in me trying to mold him to being a better person.  And what's the point, really, here?  Well, I feel like then the reason Matt is not a good intern is because his leadership is not motivated.  Well, I mean, I feel like then there's something to be said there.  That, you know, Matt now has an excuse if he's not the greatest intern of all time. 
[03:44:00]  No, how about he doesn't listen.  He doesn't apply himself.  He doesn't try.  Listen, I'm hearing some of those qualities in his leader.  Doesn't apply himself.  Well, fuck yourself.  Not trying.  That's what I'm hearing here, Eric.  Well, he did pick him to be the intern, right?  I mean, there was a lot of potential candidates.  He's the boss.  He's the one that said, this guy's the guy.  And, you know, you'd think he would step up to the plate and really want to mold these kids into something. 
[03:44:30]  It's not about the first day, Eric.  It's about the last day.  It's about how we end things.  And Matt ends better than Sal, number one intern.  Not going to happen.  Is Matt coming back?  No, definitely not.  So what's the point?  Because.  Thank you, Troy.  What's the point of him being here?  To become a better person.  Yes, but he has to want to do that himself.  Not be forced upon him.  But his leader has to want to lead him.  Oh, fuck you.  That's bullshit.  No, that's not bullshit.  Could a football team win a game without a coach? 
[03:45:00]  I don't think so, Skipper.  Yeah, but the people on the team want to be there.  I don't think so, Skipper.  What do you recommend that he works on from now until Friday?  Eric?  No, Matt.  Eric needs to work on his leadership skills.  And Matt.  Keep laughing, asshole.  See?  Oh, see?  Maybe it's tough love.  I'm not going to judge how Eric leads as long as he's leading.  But, you know, I think Matt has a lot of things to work on.  He starts with common sense.  Yeah, I mean, you're not going to develop that in a week. 
[03:45:30]  Well, with good leadership, you might.  No.  You're born with it or not.  That's not true.  No, you could develop it, but not in a week.  A week and a day.  Yeah.  You know, a week and a day.  It's more than a week.  A week and a day, still.  Can I just chime in?  What's up, Sal?  You're forgetting the fact that Matt has no skills or creativity whatsoever.  So he's just this blob.  And I believe it was Napoleon Dynamite who said,  What?  Women like guys with skills.  You know, like nunchuck skills.  So, I mean, that does ring true. 
[03:46:00]  But an internship is about acquiring skills as much as it is about having skills.  And, okay, so if he's this late into it and he's acquired zero,  how is he going to turn himself around in that time?  Maybe if he has a better leader.  You know?  Maybe.  But he should have.  Other people here were allowed to maybe take this position, and they're not.  They're not allowed.  It's just you.  You're the only one who's allowed.  So you've got to do it.  You've got to do it.  You've got to step up.  I've dealt.  I have.  I've tried.  I've dealt.  You haven't. 
[03:46:30]  No, I haven't.  Trust me.  I spend way too much time with Matt.  There's nothing Eric can physically do.  You know what Sal's doing right here?  And Matt sees this in the other room.  Sal's getting a little scared.  Sal's like, oh, no.  I don't want somebody to take my number one spot, number one intern of the semester.  We need to claim one next Friday.  Sal's worried that after all the work he's put in, Matt is going to come,  and he's going to win this thing in the last lap, which is very possible with the right  coaching, Eric.  Coaching. 
[03:47:00]  This is all my fault, isn't it?  Matt would have to pull some crazy shit out of his ass.  Well, you know what?  He'd have to show up with, like, hookers and pizza.  That's the wrong way to do it.  Not bribing.  Well, I mean, if he wanted my vote, that's how he'd have to do it.  That's why you can't lead the intern.  You're also not allowed.  No one gave me the right to do that.  Yeah, I'm not allowed to do it.  I'm just saying, if he wanted to win, that's how he'd have to do it.  You can do this.  I know Matt can do it.  I see the potential in him every day.  I look at him.  All that I, when I see Matt come in this studio, and I think everybody can bear witness to this. 
[03:47:30]  Should we bring him in?  No, no, no.  He's fine in the other room.  He's got his screen calls.  He's doing his job, like he always does.  But the only thing I've ever said about Matt is, there is a wealth of untapped potential.  That's all I've ever said about the kid.  Yeah.  No, I believe that.  And he could have done so much more with his internship here.  He could have really...  But he didn't have a strong leader.  Well, I mean, that has something to do with it.  But also, it's his motivation.  I think he just has no motivation and just doesn't...  He doesn't really care. 
[03:48:00]  I think he comes...  What's he doing in here?  Matt, I didn't ask you to come in here.  I said don't come in here.  Okay.  You know?  Can I say one thing?  Mm-mm.  No.  Just one thing.  You just did.  Now, Eric, where are you?  I thought we had this conversation.  I know I can do this.  Okay.  But what are you going to do?  No, I don't want to hear from him.  I don't want to hear from him.  I just...  Can I...  Can he talk to me, though?  No.  Because I want to know what he's going to do.  It's off.  You see what I did?  The mic's off.  But, like, what can you do in one week?  It doesn't matter.  Eric, you've got to dismiss your intern from the studio. 
[03:48:30]  I'm about to kick you out.  You don't want to get kicked out.  No.  Kick him out.  Five, four, three, two...  Okay, he didn't get kicked out this time.  He got dismissed again.  Eric.  Yeah.  You've got to instill some discipline in this kid.  Mm-mm.  He lacks discipline.  Nope.  Six days and counting.  That's not the way to do this.  You see what the problem is here, don't you, Troy?  No.  I mean, what can I do?  You've got your boss saying, six days and counting, I can slough off until you just leave.  That's not cool.  I mean, what motivates you? 
[03:49:00]  Like, imagine if you're headed towards the playoffs, and the coach says, ah, we only got  a couple games left.  Whatever.  Win, lose.  I'm going to be in the back smoking some reefer.  You know what I mean?  What's going to motivate you as a team to win?  But this attitude of Eric's, I mean, this isn't anything new, right?  Well, you know what?  You know what that means?  Maybe this exercise would be beneficial to two people.  But do you really think that it's going to...  How long have you been with this show, Eric?  Seven years. 
[03:49:30]  Seven years.  So do you think after seven years, he's going to change?  I do.  I do.  Eric?  I don't think in your heart of hearts you really believe that.  I believe that.  I believe that to be true.  I believe you have it in you to be the gold medal winning leader that we all know you  can, and to be the guy who leads Matt to get in that World Series ring.  On his finger, okay?  To lead him into the championships.  And when he is standing in the studio next Friday saying, I am the greatest of the interns, 
[03:50:00]  you're going to be in that room with a tear in your eye saying, there he is, little Eric  Jr.  That's my boy.  Nope.  Why not?  Because I don't care.  What do you care about?  That's a big problem, Eric.  I care about the show.  Do you?  I care about getting shit done.  Do you?  And I can't sit here.  There's a difference between him being an intern and me giving him things to do and making  sure he's doing it right.  And then there's being a babysitter because he decides to take it in his head to go and 
[03:50:30]  do shit when no one's looking.  No one's aware of it.  I can't sit there and follow him all the time.  I think if you cared about the show, you would want this to happen.  Because, number one, this is good for the show to see it all pan out.  And number two, it's good for the show to have the best possible interns.  You know what I mean?  That is true.  Roland, have you been hearing what's going on?  No.  I've been having joyful things told to me.  Dick's in the ass? 
[03:51:00]  A massive cock in the face and in the ass.  One in the face and in the ass.  Anthony Bourdain went well.  That was awesome.  And Joe Rogan this morning.  Joe's the man.  To die for.  I mean, with Joe Rogan, you know that you have a great guest on your hands when it's 6 o'clock  in the morning, as the show starts, 10 minutes in, you're questioning what your place on  this planet really is and how you got here and what happens after 6 o'clock in the morning. 
[03:51:30]  And then I like how Joe explained where things were created, like people that don't understand  things, but they think they do.  That just blew my mind.  Roland's not in a good mood.  Roland's in a dark, dark place.  He's in a tough place.  What happened?  You know, people, when they understand certain jobs, but yet they want to throw authority  to that job.  What people?  I don't know.  Just people.  What jobs?  I don't know.  It's a book I'm reading.  Talent booker?  No, it's a book I'm reading. 
[03:52:00]  It's called Things I Don't Know, But I Will Say.  Oh, so some...  Okay, so in this book...  Yes.  The lead character is maybe being told how to do their job when the person telling  that character doesn't even know what their job is.  Yeah, but then nobody here, though.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's a novel.  It's a fiction.  It's a fiction novel.  And you're kind of bummed out because you've been reading that chapter.  Either that or they hate Mexicans.  I don't know.  We don't know.  I don't know.  It's a character we're talking about.  They'd be racist. 
[03:52:30]  Yes!  They'd be racist.  It's a Mexican character?  It's an Indian character.  It's a Mexican...  It's an Indian character.  But hey, it's Thursday.  Tomorrow's Friday.  Another long drinking week.  You can drink tonight.  I text GC and we'll be drinking...  Greg Charles from Caroline's.  Yep.  Caroline's Comedy Club.  You can still get Joe DeRosa tickets, by the way.  It's carolines.com and the little online code is O-N-A, all lowercase letters. 
[03:53:00]  You'll be here next week, too.  You can get them for almost 50% off the tickets, so it's definitely worth doing.  $10 tickets.  I mean, movies cost $15, $20.  Somebody's going to see DeRosa.  Who gave you the dick in the ass?  I don't know.  Life.  It's not life.  It's a person.  It's not life.  Life gives me...  Is it a person or multiple people?  Life.  I think that means a person.  No, I think it's multiple.  So...  Because he said he did say a dick in the ass and one in his mouth, too, as well.  Well, he didn't say they were separate dicks, though.  It could have come out of the ass into the mouth, even worse. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, ATM.  Are we dealing with an ATM situation or a shish kebab situation?  I'd say a lemon party.  Lemon...  Wow.  Okay.  So you're getting...  And which one are you?  The one where I have the dick in the mouth and in the ass.  So we're lemon party to the next level.  Lemon party to the next level.  What's bothering you today, Rowan?  Life.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You came in, you obviously want to talk a little bit. 
[03:54:00]  It's difficult being a talent booker.  People don't know that.  People follow the glamour.  Yeah, people just see you rubbing elbows with Hollywood.  That's not what it's about, though.  It's my sad soul crying.  That's what it is.  Because you have to play the Hollywood game.  Then you have to get in here.  And you have to deal with all these people.  Oh, over here.  And here's the easiest part.  Is it?  Yeah.  Let me ask you this question.  Did you receive a dick in the ass in this building or out of this building? 
[03:54:30]  I don't know.  I got so many.  I don't know if I'm coming or going.  I will not ask any follow-up questions.  Was the dick in the ass an in-house dick?  I won't ask you what department.  I swear to you, Roland.  And you don't have to answer them.  No follow-up questions.  An in-house dick could have been anyone from intern Matt to Danny to the big ball.  Anyone.  Anyone.  Was it an in-house dick or was it?  I think multiple.  In-N-L.  The main dick, though. 
[03:55:00]  In-N-L.  The main one.  The one that's really got you bothered.  Yeah, wrap up, dude.  You know what that means, Troy.  What's up?  In-house.  Yeah.  You know what it was.  Was it Mark Zito from Ron and Fez?  I just saw him out there.  No, no.  I think he's panicked because they have a guest on the top of the hour.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll make sure we give him plenty of time for that.  It was.  It was.  Mars in-house.  Did he have hair or no hair?  That's getting too specific.  Don't answer that question, Roland.  That's a trap.  It is a trap. 
[03:55:30]  My fellow Mexican brother.  Mexican.  In-house.  Is that an insult?  Being called a Mexican?  Not at all.  I mean, it's cool.  But I'm not Mexican.  Yeah, I'm brown.  Puerto Ricans look down on the Mexicans, is that right?  No, no.  Not at all.  They look at them as like the lower of the...  It's like the Asians look at the Chinese like that.  No, we look down at Puerto Ricans.  He just said it's like the Asians look at the Chinese.  Chinese are Asian.  Yeah.  I know, but they're the lower.  They're the lowest.  In Asian...  Because I've talked to Asian people, and they say that Chinese is the lowest. 
[03:56:00]  And who's the highest?  Japanese.  Was it an Asian dick in the ass?  No.  I might want Chinese food, though.  Yeah.  I'm craving now.  Well, listen.  Roland, I hope the day gets better for you.  It is, because Spencer and I are going to get fatty food today.  Oh, I know.  Okay, so...  Dick in the ass.  Overeating.  Yeah.  It's been a stressful one, huh?  I'm getting a double fucking milkshake, dude.  Wow.  Let's go to a massage parlor. 
[03:56:30]  What do you think, Roland?  Is that something you do with Troy?  Again?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Never mind.  I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.  Do what Troy is.  He's sunshine.  I know how to bring some sunshine to your life.  Let the sunshine in.  We have to get going, Roland.  Yeah, and we're trying to have to go tug away.  You're going to...  On each other.  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, normally somebody else is doing the tugging, but you guys are going to go tug away. 
[03:57:00]  No, no, we're going to pay somebody else to do it.  So when you said go to a massage parlor, you meant to seek employment as a rub-and-tug girl.  No, to be relieved of stress and pressure.  Handjobs.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I get that.  Table baths.  Well, listen.  Oh, wait, safety first, like in Trojans.  I was just about to say, if you're there, you never know what kind of diseases you're going  to get on those calloused masseuse hands.  So why don't you make sure you wear Trojan bearskin condoms.  Trojan.  America's number one most trusted condom brand. 
[03:57:30]  Also Trojan.  Recommended by Prince Nagels all around Florida.  Eric, do you use Trojans when you're trying to hide those Prince Nagels from them?  I used to, yes.  You do?  Of course you did.  Now he just goes raw dog.  Raw dog in that ass.  I mean, you know what that implies.  Yeah.  You said I used to.  Yeah.  Now he's just raw dog in it.  I'm barebacking that motherfucker.  Good for you, Eric, and I can't wait to see the results we get from intern Matt.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.
