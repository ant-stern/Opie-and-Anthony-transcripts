<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about the delayed arrival of summer in New York City, with Opie expressing his preference for a gradual transition through spring.  This segued into listener calls, including one from Tom, who praised the new French doors at Opie's brother's restaurant, F.H. Riley's.  Listeners were encouraged to send in pictures.  The conversation then took a dark turn, speculating on the Air France plane crash and the lack of survivors, with darkly humorous commentary from the hosts.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to an absurd calculation: how long it would take to fill their studio with semen, using global ejaculation rates as a basis.  This involved complex (and ultimately inaccurate) calculations incorporating birth rates, ejaculate volume, and studio cubic footage, with multiple listener calls contributing to the increasingly ridiculous estimations.  The hosts and callers discussed the smell, texture, and implications of such a scenario, even imagining a "cum river" rivalling the Mississippi.  The discussion also inexplicably involved Peter North and the daily production of shirts.

A caller, Megan, described her experiences working at a disappointing underwater hotel in Florida, detailing the cramped, algae-covered conditions and the logistical challenges of underwater life.  This was followed by more bizarre caller contributions: one detailing a childhood experiment involving semen in a mason jar, another discussing a college paper on semen viscosity.  Another caller recounted mailing semen to a girlfriend. Yet another provided an alternative calculation for filling the studio with semen based on the world's male population.

The show then shifted to discussing President Bush's visit to Saudi Arabia, a bodega robbery, and Opie's $10,000 Times Square stunt.  Opie recounted placing a $10,000 bill in Times Square and filming a woman finding it.  He expressed concern over the possibility of the bill being spent.  The segment concluded with Opie sharing harrowing anecdotes about murder-suicides and overdoses in his childhood home and a Manhattan apartment he'd considered,  leaving the hosts still discussing these unsettling events.

The show continued with more stories about unsettling apartment histories, shared by both hosts and callers, involving deaths, suicides, and murders.  Callers described houses where suicides or murder-suicides had occurred, detailing the aftermath and the ethical implications of real estate disclosure.  The hosts darkly speculated on the number of undiscovered bodies in New York City apartments.

This was followed by an in-studio interview with Brooke Hogan.  The conversation covered her reality show, *Brooke Knows Best*, her strained relationship with her mother (attributing it partly to the spotlight and financial motivations), her breast augmentation, and her upcoming album.  The hosts referenced a prior encounter at a Halloween party and a supposedly inaccurate pre-interview sheet.  A brief mention of a backstage interview with Joe Frazier earlier in the show was also made.

A significant portion of the show focused on a series of gaffes by staff member Sam regarding Brooke Hogan's promotional information, with blame being shifted between Sam, Roland, and Steve C.  The inaccurate website, brookhoganmusic.com, was highlighted.  The show then featured a series of calls with E-Rock, who claimed to have pneumonia, resulting in much skepticism and joking from the hosts and callers. Dr. Steve was called for a (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) medical opinion.  Mashup Nicole also made a brief in-studio appearance.  Lady Trucker and other callers weighed in on Sam's mistakes and E-Rock's supposed illness.  E-Rock reluctantly performed a lung-sound demonstration. The segment also included tangential discussions about the MTV Movie Awards stunt with Eminem and a listener's request for stories of rude public behavior.  E-Rock eventually returned to the studio.

Finally, the show concluded with a discussion about a Long Island convenience store robbery where the owner, after being threatened with a bat, gave the robber $40 and bread. The hosts and a caller, CJ, debated the owner's actions, touching upon gun ownership and the robber's credibility.  This was followed by a discussion of a list of "25 Kid Shows That Must Have Been Created by Adults on Drugs," with the hosts mocking various children's television programs. The show concluded with a brief mention of Kenny's morning mashup demo and the hosts' departure, with significant profanity throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah! Is it Whip-Em-Out Wednesday?  Oh, it is!  We gotta get that wow thing going again.  Where are we?  Yeah, well, when summer starts, sometime around maybe August or September,  here in the New York area, anyway.  You were bitching about that yesterday, but I gotta tell ya, I'm disgusted.  The last couple of years, we went from winter to summer, and I hated that, 
[00:00:30]  because I'm a big spring guy. I like the spring.  So I don't mind that it's slowly developing into summer. I really don't.  You know something, though?  You're all about the heat.  I like the heat.  You want in. You want all in right away, right?  I like the heat. I like, yeah, summer.  And the reason is that it's gonna seem so fast.  When you have a summer that starts in the middle of June,  then it's over.  Once Labor Day hits, the Earth knows, for some reason, when Labor Day hits, 
[00:01:00]  that the weather gets colder.  Not necessarily.  We get a few nice days.  That's how it used to be, but all the seasons went, take a step to the right.  Well, I hope you're right.  They took a step to the right, meaning, you know, it used to be what?  April showers bring the blah, blah, blah.  Now it's May showers bring the June blah, blah, blahs.  Well, you know what I'm saying, though?  We moved a little to the right.  When September rolls around.  That should make you happy.  We all moved to the right.  But here's what it is.  We moved to the right for you, Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  No.  When September rolls around, you're not gonna tell me the entire month of September  is gonna be weather in the 90s, and 80s, 85, 90 degrees like August is supposed to be.  All right, we got a lot of creeps that listen to this show, and I mean that lovingly.  Ghouls.  Someone will remember this conversation, because the stuff you remember, we don't remember.  It leaves our brains, but for some reason, you guys remember everything.  Your names, where we met you.  Right, right, right.  Mark this day. 
[00:02:00]  September is gonna be solid.  Solid.  All right, well, from your mouth to God's ears.  You know what I love about Labor Day?  We're not even close, but I'm a big beach guy, and like August, how many days in August?  31.  All right, 31.  So August 31st, beach is packed, lifeguards, snack bars, everything is rocking, and business  is booming.  The next day, they decide, ah. 
[00:02:30]  Ghost town.  Yeah, lifeguards aren't needed anymore, and the snack bars close.  Ferry schedule changes to one ferry a week.  And it's the same exact weather as the day before.  Yeah.  Business is still booming.  Keep the stupid lifeguards out there, and keep the snack bars open, because we all need  our curly fries.  If we had more than two days in May that were nice, it might have been a little easier for  me here, but it's like, now, driving in today, it's pouring rain. 
[00:03:00]  Now, listen to the weather forecast, rain, rain, rain, maybe by the weekend, we'll get  this rain out of here.  I've had it.  I have had it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Hold on.  You know what?  I heard this is true.  Let me go to Tom in Huntington, New York, Anthony.  It's an eyewitness.  Tom?  What's up, boys?  Good morning.  First phone call.  What do you got?  I just wanted to say, Opie, congratulations on your French doors at F.H. Riley's. 
[00:03:30]  We don't look like a tavern anymore, my friends.  Really?  Not at all.  That was affecting the business a little bit, because my brother is an amazing chef.  Most people will agree with me that F.H. Riley's does very well, but the problem is, from  the outside, it looks like it's a pub.  So, a lot of the locals who don't know about the radio show, they don't come in because  they think they're going to get a burger, like beer food, in between drafts.  Yeah.  So, brother Brett said, F that, I'm going French doors, and he put them in yesterday. 
[00:04:00]  Looks great.  Well, how about this?  Someone take a really nice picture of it and send it in, and I'll tweet your picture  of the French doors.  What are French doors?  They open up to the air.  Now, then you put some tables on the sidewalk.  And then it looks very inviting.  That's where the window was?  That whole thing is out.  That whole front wall thing?  I don't know, Tom?  Blew it out?  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Is the whole front out?  The whole front is just all windows.  It's gorgeous.  So, to the right of the door as you're walking in.  Wait, you're there right now?  Right now, I'm on the corner of 110 and Main Street right now, and I'm pulling up to it  right now.  I'll take a picture of it right now with my camera phone.  All right.  Dan, you want to take FH Riley's French door pictures today?  I would like nothing more.  All right.  Danny at?  At opianthony.com.  Okay.  Danny at opianthony.com.  I will tweet the best picture of the French doors at FH Riley's. 
[00:05:00]  Tom, you might not have the best picture.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  There's no cars on the street, and that's why I'm going to have the clearest view.  All right.  I appreciate the phone call.  Yeah, we're very excited about that.  It's going to change the business a bit, make it inviting.  Maybe, Ed, you go there, and you get a little table on the sidewalk now.  Look at that.  Look at that.  And a pit goes down.  Watch out.  Yeah.  No, that's good news, because it always looked like a pub. 
[00:05:30]  My brother did the best he could from the outside.  Inside, it doesn't whatsoever.  But people are just stupid.  They walk by.  Oh, well, it's a pub.  They look in the window.  They see a bar.  Yeah.  They're like, ah, well.  Yeah.  It's just the next step.  When you own a restaurant, it's the next step.  Business is very good, but now this will really put it over the top.  I've never been there when it wasn't mobbed, because I was always there for a show event.  I know.  For something where there's just pests all over the place.  Pestilence.  Yeah.  Pestilence.  New Year's Eve, we went in there.  I never went in there just to relax and eat a quiet meal. 
[00:06:00]  Honestly, on a slower night, it's great, because it does mellow out.  Yeah.  We're there, what?  We're pushed up against a wall, like.  Yeah.  Sweaty hands touch you.  Duh!  Right.  I know.  Trying to eat like finger food, and they're shaking your hands with their sweaty mitts.  What's worse than a nervous, sweaty hand?  Isn't that great?  A lot of pictures when you put up FH Riley's is me and the ex. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's Ian and Steve from Bayshore.  That's his ex.  Ian and Steve from Bayshore.  Well, that was a very famous picture.  You're a part of-  Of course.  We should put that on the celebrity wall.  Are we allowed to?  FH Riley lore.  Are we allowed to put it on the celebrity wall?  Sure.  I'm on the celebrity wall.  You're on the celebrity wall.  And I think we got Clark Gillies, and that's it.  Why not?  I have to get this.  And some black boxer that I think won the Golden Gloves or something back in 1955. 
[00:07:00]  Ooh.  That's our celebrities for our restaurant.  My mom got sick of changing the pictures in the frames at home, I guess.  You know, with three kids that are, you know, whatever, as far as our relationships go.  You know, she's over the years had to do a lot of changing in those, you know, the picture frames that have about 20 pictures in them.  Right.  Of family and stuff like that.  So now I noticed a picture was just shoved in the picture frame, covering another picture.  Oh, really?  On the outside.  So you could just flop it away. 
[00:07:30]  And I flopped it away, and oh, look who was under there.  And do you play guess which X is under the new picture?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Guess what X is under the new picture.  Oh, wow.  I was thinking it was blah, blah, but no.  No, look at that.  We're going way back to this picture.  Wow.  Really taking it back.  More rain means lower water bill, meaning lower taxes on ants' phone bill.  Whatever.  The massive tsunami changed all the weather by shifting the Earth's axis. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, is that what happened?  It shifted our axes?  I guess.  All right.  I just want summer.  That's all.  Thank you.  You're not getting it today or tomorrow, right?  No.  A little weird rain showers in the New York area?  Getting awful rain.  Remember when we used to...  There was a listener who did weather for the entire country or all the cities we were syndicated in?  All right.  We got to bring that back.  That was hilarious.  The guy ran through the weather of like 25 cities within 30 seconds. 
[00:08:30]  Wasn't that to deal with that douche in Chicago who wanted local radio?  I kind of want to bring that bit back.  It's pretty funny.  Just key cities around America.  Really fast.  Did that guy just send that?  He sent it already?  Let me see.  I have not seen this yet, Dan.  That's how it looks.  That looks nice.  That technology is amazing.  You know what?  I say we could get a better picture than that.  Was that Tom?  That had to be somebody else.  It came from...  Hold on. 
[00:09:00]  Sorry.  It came from a cell phone, so there's no name.  All right.  All right.  I'll tweet that.  That's the new look of FH Riley's.  What do you think, Dan?  I like it.  Yeah, absolutely.  I like that.  It doesn't look like a pub anymore.  No.  And that was one of our problems.  And you open those up when summer hits?  Open it up and get a nice breeze.  We'll throw a few tables on the sidewalk.  You see that white door to the right?  Yeah.  What's up with that?  That guy was an asshole.  Why?  Oh, and he was an asshole.  Oh, boy, was he an asshole.  There were rumors that he was tapping into my brother's stuff, so he got free electricity 
[00:09:30]  and water.  Oh, hey.  That's nice.  Just something you got to deal with when you're a business owner.  Can't he paint the door to look a little more wood-like?  He won't let you paint it?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  That's just the first step, because then the door's coming out, and there's going to  be more French doors over there.  Oh, the main door, right?  Yeah.  I don't even know if I should tweak this picture, because that's just the beginning, because  then he's painting the whole thing, a brand new sign. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, work in progress.  Yeah, work in progress.  All right.  What's going on with the airplane?  Oh, boy.  How many survivors so far?  Oh, well, that doesn't look good.  Why can't a few people survive a plane crash in the year 2009?  No one ever survives those big ones.  But there's got to be something.  Well, you get something like Sully, you know, lands in the river, everyone lives.  It's a happy story.  I'm talking horrific plane crash.  Someone does survive.  Well, the whole thing comes apart at about 35,000 feet. 
[00:10:30]  What about a big airbag inside?  Big airbag?  Or just fills up with those styrofoam peanuts dropped from the overhead compartment.  They're all just stuck in them.  They probably can figure it out, but it would probably be way too expensive to change all  the planes over to this idea they got that, where maybe a few people would end up surviving.  I don't know.  I'm not talking about 500 miles an hour or so.  Yeah, I know the...  Parachute to the...  Some kind of parachute, which you could deploy when you were beyond help, is the only way. 
[00:11:00]  But what would happen is it would probably...  There were times where it would accidentally deploy.  It would bring a plane down.  Yeah, man.  Like, it would balance out, probably.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is just badness.  Really?  This thing.  The plane.  Ah.  It has a great safety record.  The plane itself.  Air France has a pretty good safety record.  This, I think, is their worst crash in 72 years or business.  They're saying this is going to be the worst crash since, what, 9-11? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Since 2001?  Or that other one that happened just after 9-11.  Over Queens?  Oh, is that what they meant by...  Maybe.  Maybe.  I'm not sure.  Because they said 2001, and I was just assuming the big 9-11 thing, but I forgot there was  another plane crash that year.  Oh, and then we freaked out thinking, oh, boy.  I was on a train when all that was going down.  Like, oh, they're at it again.  Yeah.  Up to their shenanigans.  That just turned out to be a strange coincidence.  Yeah.  But that was 2001, and now we're looking, you know, 2009, and here's a biggie. 
[00:12:00]  It looks like weather-related, but now a drudge report was saying that apparently there was  a bomb threat made before this plane went missing.  It was in Buenos Aires, right?  Stand back, Buenos Aires.  Hi.  I was just saying a little of the Vita for you people.  A little of the Vita while I punch up drudge.  Well, they said it might have tried to turn around, too. 
[00:12:30]  Bomb threat, Air France in South America, days before flight disappeared over the Atlantic.  And then, let's see, the airport safety delayed an Air France flight this evening.  That was May 27th.  Before departing for Paris immediately after the company received bomb threat over the  phone at the airport in Buenos Aires.  Buenos Aires.  So, yeah, they got a bomb threat.  Whether that means anything.  But, wow. 
[00:13:00]  You know, that thing came apart.  They found a couple of seats.  One seat cushion, I think.  And then some metallic pieces.  A couple of plastic pieces.  Just nothing.  But if a seat survives, come on.  If you're strapped to it, you think.  Come on.  Let's think about this.  It's a seat cushion.  It's not even the whole seat.  All right.  So, your head survives.  Yeah, exactly.  When a country sends a submarine to help with the rescue effort, you know it can't be good.  They're not down there going, I can't wait until the submarine gets here.  How far down are we? 
[00:13:30]  Two miles.  But we should be fine once the sub gets here.  You liked my impression of the fish nipping at the dead body.  Oh, that's so sick to think of.  Like, the submarine goes down there and then they just see that floating kind of...  Frozen-eyed human.  You're just, like, just floating in space.  And the fish are going...  Yeah.  My impression, basically, the fish bites you and then has to back up immediately.  Those weird...  They're just weird.  Fish are weird. 
[00:14:00]  It's creepy.  They don't know how to smile.  They don't know how to cry.  How do they think?  Motionless faces.  Big eyes.  Don't blink.  What the fuck do they think?  They don't even make a face when they shit.  No.  And their asshole just opens up and it floats out and they keep going.  Yeah.  Wasn't it?  Not another fish laughing at this big log coming out.  How would you know if they're laughing?  You don't know what they're doing.  You don't.  They don't even move their mouth when they're eating.  Well, they do that.  The whole thing just kind of, like, opens up in a weird way and...  Fish is stupid. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  So no survivors there.  I hope it wasn't weather.  That's fucking scary.  But they said it looked like the pilot turned around because of the way the wreckage was scattered.  It's a 30-mile trail of wreckage.  Oh.  They said that there was obviously a problem and it was at night.  So, you know, they were just...  That could be 30 miles because if that thing blows up in the air...  Oh, yeah.  Uh, it's going to get scattered around pretty well.  And, I don't know.  That's just a weird thing to go in with that much force where it busts the whole plane apart 
[00:15:00]  if you were under any kind of control.  You know what I mean?  Like, it gets hit by lightning and has this catastrophic failure.  Or weather rips an engine off.  I don't know.  And they apparently don't know either.  Well, you have France is probably stressing weather because you never want to say it could  have been a mechanical failure unless you have to because that scares people.  Yep.  Uh, to me, weather scares me more because weather you're always going to run into, mechanical  failures are very rare.  But I, hopefully, it was probably something on the plane that was just...  Well, they have that storm system.  Um, so, I, I think, I'm going to, I'm, they're saying they're never going to find the black 
[00:15:30]  box.  I mean, the water in that area is ridiculously deep, over two miles or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, it's, it sounds like that I would go with pilot error, thinking he could handle  this, uh, weather system, realize, holy shit, and, uh, like Ann said, possibly started trying  to turn around and all hell broke loose.  Oof.  Like, there's no way we're going to be able to get through this.  How fucking horrifying that must have been.  The people, because you're out of radar contact at that point. 
[00:16:00]  Like, they use some weird, some weird technology, like, you're not even in regular voice contact  with, with the people and there's no radar tracking.  Oof.  So, uh, cause you're going, there was some weird place between West Africa and Brazil.  You flew to Iraq, right?  Yes.  I, I flew to, uh, um, Athens once and, and what freaked me out was when we were over the  ocean for, I don't even know anymore, hours, like six, I want to guess six to eight straight  hours, you're looking down at water.  That horrified me like I've never been horrified before. 
[00:16:30]  Like when I, I hate flying, but when you look down, you see land.  And in some bizarre way in your mind, you're like, eh, all right, well, if there's a problem,  maybe they can figure something out.  Cause there's land.  They can land somewhere.  At least they're going to find like a piece of me or something.  I don't know.  Something for the family.  You know, logically it probably doesn't make sense, but in your, in your brain, it helps  a little bit.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when you're over that water for six to eight straight hours, just looking at the  ocean, I can't, I can't explain to you. 
[00:17:00]  Depending on a couple of turbine engines.  Right.  Right.  Keep, keep spinning.  I can't explain the anxiety I felt going over the ocean.  I, I, as soon as I saw land, then I felt immediately better.  But you could still crash obviously.  Right.  But yeah, but you, and you see the, you know, you kind of see that the waves are like a little  different than like, you know, flying down to Florida where they go out off the coast  just a little bit.  These are deep ocean waves.  You gotta be kidding. 
[00:17:30]  We're counting on these engines.  Even if there was a miracle and you lived, you'd just be that guy stuck in a perfect storm  in those giant waves in the middle of nowhere going, this is great.  That's, that's one question I'm going to ask God out of all these plane crashes, how  many people actually survived and then were eaten by a shark or something?  Drowned.  Uh, 32.  Do you think that happens though?  God will tell you 32 people.  You think some of these people survive, but they're paralyzed or something from the crash  and go, holy shit, I just survived something unbelievable. 
[00:18:00]  No one will ever know because now I have to drown to death.  Yeah.  Or, wow, there's a shark that decided I'm lunch.  It turns out there were no survivors.  Uh, that's what they'll say.  It turns out there was no survivors.  Meanwhile, it's like, no, no, I made it.  I survived the initial impact of this thing.  And then a shark bit me in two, bobbed up like a top.  You can't find anything that gives a fuck less about you than the ocean.  You can't, you can't find a place, a harsher place to have a problem than the middle 
[00:18:30]  of the ocean.  God damn, that is a frightening place.  You have nothing.  There's no recourse.  So why can't we just put floaty things out there?  Just in case.  All over the ocean?  Just sprinkle them liberally out there.  We're humans.  Let's start putting floaty things out there.  What a coincidence if one of the, or break emergency, you know, a break in case of emergency,  break glass, uh, where there's life preservers and stuff and you just happen to crash there.  The oceans are giant.  They're just so huge.  You've been on a cruise ship, obviously. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You go on a cruise ship and you feel like, oh my God, this is huge.  This is a mall.  This is whatever.  Yeah.  And then you see that same cruise ship, especially if you're flying to like Miami or Florida.  They're all over the water and you're like, is that, that's a cruise ship down there?  It could just go bloop and be gone.  And then you start looking to the left and to the right and then, and the massiveness of,  of, of the ocean at that point, you're like, oh my God.  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.  Yeah.  You gotta be kidding me.  It's a scary place. 
[00:19:30]  They also say that when they fly over the ocean, they're supposed to be five to 10 miles  separating planes, but because they have no radar contact, they do it where it's like  80 miles separating them.  So there's plenty of room to fucking make mistakes because they can't see each other.  So the whole time you're flying, you're just like, please, nothing hit me.  Please, nothing hit me.  It's comfortable.  Speaking of flying, did, um, you guys check out dig.com from time to time.  I'm sure.  Go to dig.com.  They have a, uh, they have this video.  It could have been better, but it shows you every flight in the world in 72 seconds. 
[00:20:00]  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen that yet.  Yep.  I think it was dig.  If not, it might've been, uh, uh, now I gotta, uh, we can find it during the break, but basically  it was some kind of satellite photo imaging thing and they're, they showed the flights  and it just looks like, it just looks like pollen, just pollen moving around the earth  real fast for, for, Oh, here it is. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  That is sick.  Where is this Danny for the people at home?  Uh, they could just, uh, go to dig.com.  That's D I G G.com and just search a flight 72.  It'll come up.  And for the people that are afraid to fly like myself, this type of thing actually helps because  you realize when you're, you're, you're flying, you're one lousy dot of all that.  All those dot, look at that.  Look at, it looks like the tides.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could see that stream going from Buenos Aires to, uh, what does it look like for the 
[00:21:00]  people?  Not, it looks like bacteria.  Yeah.  Uh, eating, uh, the planet.  Right.  Look at all those.  Wait, what is the yellow though?  Is that like, those are all the flights, Jimmy.  How do they get, what does the yellow represent?  That's what they, I think that's each, each individual aircraft is a spec.  Yeah.  And, and, and what, what is the title, uh, Danny?  It's, uh, each of the United States.  Every flight and then, and video shows every flight on earth in 72 seconds. 
[00:21:30]  So is this in a, in, in a day or is this 72 seconds of real time?  Nah, it couldn't be real time.  Okay.  Yeah.  There's, it's over a 24 hour period.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Cause the dots are moving too fast.  Look at how, look at the United States.  Like the United States is just completely yellow covered.  And then look at Africa.  No one wants to go there.  Three flights.  Yeah.  No one cares.  All leaving.  That's one day of flying.  Look at all the planes coming out of the U.S.  They are now going over to Europe.  One day of flying.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  That is amazing.  Go to dig.com.  And you just gotta be on a dot that makes it.  You just gotta be on one of those specs that get from point A to point B.  That's what I'm saying, my friend.  That's all I think now.  One lousy dot.  And one day, and a lot of the days, one day, most days, all those dots make it.  Every dot makes it.  Isn't that amazing?  That's why the statistic that I read a few years ago where if you were to, airline travel  associates, if you were to randomly board a plane every day, it would be 29,000 years  before you were in a fatal crash. 
[00:22:30]  Numerically, that's how it works out.  But we don't live that long, Jimmy.  No, we don't.  Most of us don't.  Oh, that's silly.  Occasionally with exercise.  You can get up to 28,000.  28,005, and then people tend to just give up.  And say, you know what?  Enough of this crap.  I thought life would get better.  It's the same old shit after 28,000 years.  How scary is it to be one of those little yellow dots in the bottom left piece of the  screen?  Like, just there's no one within 500 miles.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  You can see some of those little dots.  There's just, they're in the middle of nowhere. 
[00:23:00]  Just going to what?  Like Manila.  Yeah, from Greenland to Manila.  Yeah.  Greenland.  Who takes the Greenland to Manila flight?  There's four guys on the plane every time it goes.  And they say, you sure you want to do this before they take off?  Yeah, I want to go to Manila.  That's a pretty cool little imaging thing there, I think.  You realize how many people aren't thinking about you, too.  Like, when you look at flights from, like, Australia to Africa, all these other places  in the world, you realize those people have complete lives. 
[00:23:30]  And none of them know I exist.  Yeah.  You ever think, you, it's all about you, yeah, exactly.  They don't give a fuck.  You ever think, and, you know, Danny's the king of the internet.  Danny is probably one of the best surfers I've ever met in my life.  How is he crowned?  Well, I mean.  King of the internet.  You don't have to be, look, you just call yourself a king of something.  And that's how it works.  Yeah, how do you think the other guy got it done?  Wow, wow, wow.  He's still the king of all media and hasn't done anything in the media in 10 years. 
[00:24:00]  I'll tell you one thing, if Danny was the king of...  It's just amazing to me.  So we need titles.  Yeah, well, good luck.  We have them.  What, assholes?  Assholes, shithead.  Douchebags, I think.  If Danny really was the king of the internet, he would have pulled up a picture of himself  smiling in front of the internet with a crown on.  But he didn't.  Well, you know what?  Someone's going to Photoshop that now.  I'll have to take a picture later.  You should.  Listen, here's my question. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know if Danny can figure this one out.  And I think we've tried to do this before.  Some dumb thing I think about every once in a while.  What is, as far as the world goes, we start here.  Prime time for flying.  Like United States, when are the most flights in the air in the United States, would you guess?  I would say...  There's a lot of commuters that are first plane out.  So, I mean, is it early?  I would think midday. 
[00:25:00]  Hard to say when people are traveling, too.  What would you guess, Ant?  You're a flying expert.  I would say midday.  Like what?  Two or three?  No, I would say probably noon to three.  Noon to three.  Noon to three.  That's when there are the most planes in the air?  A lot of planes.  That's what I would say.  That's what I would guess.  It's a pure guess.  Taking off from the United States?  Because then I want to do it for the world.  So, what would be the prime time for the world?  Because now you've got to figure out time zones and all that shit.  Oh, my God.  That's crazy now. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, but this would be a great little question for a little math class.  Any pilots listening?  There's got to be a pilot.  I'm going to guess nine in the morning because I'm going to guess business travelers.  Nine in the morning for the world.  Nine in the morning Eastern time for the world would be...  Oh, no.  Because Western time, it had to be later then.  It would have to be later, right?  To get their morning rush hour, you figure that's say six o'clock, say 7.30, 10.30 our time then.  A lot of our morning flights are still in the air, 10.30, and that also covers 7.30 or 6.30 in Los Angeles.  Something to ponder.  And once in a while, I'll be just doing my dumb life and I'll think to myself, how many people right now are in the air? 
[00:26:00]  How many human beings are in the air right now?  And you don't get answers to these questions, unfortunately.  And then how many people are underwater right now?  Underwater.  So how many people are...  You know what I mean?  You mean like what?  Diving?  Scuba diving?  Or in the submarines?  You got the submarines.  You got the divers.  You got those dumb underwater hotels here and there.  Those things are stupid.  Does anybody have underwater hotels?  Oh, yeah.  I would love to check out where it was. 
[00:26:30]  You go in.  You go down through an airlock.  Yeah.  And then you're in a little hotel underwater.  What?  You haven't heard of the underwater hotels?  It's insanity.  Yeah.  And then your room, you're looking out.  It's like an aquarium.  How cool is that?  You sleep there?  Yes.  I don't think you're down that far.  But you're underwater.  It's kind of like Disney where they make believe you're, what, a mile, 10,000 leagues under the sea.  And you look up and you see people walking around.  Prepare to dive. 
[00:27:00]  Dive.  E, E, E.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now 20,000 leagues below the sea.  But I see somebody with a Disney ear Mickey balloon.  You look up and through the surface.  You see a stroller.  No, you don't.  Shut up.  We're going to go.  We're diving.  You'll see bubbles come up past the window and then it'll get darker.  Because we're in a tunnel now.  Why couldn't they figure that out and make it a little easy?  That was the dumbest ride.  You always looked up and saw people. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  But I don't know if there's a place to go to figure that answer out.  But I want to know how many people are in the air, primetime flying for the world.  How many would you guess?  Tough question.  How many people are up there?  Holy shit.  You saw all those specs.  How many specs were we looking at, do you think?  You couldn't even see them.  They turned into just solid colors.  Dave, look it up.  How many flights a day worldwide are?  Is it safe to say there's 50,000 flights in the air, primetime flying for the world? 
[00:28:00]  50,000 flights.  I don't know about that.  Jesus.  Look at this one.  I don't even know.  God damn, is she hot.  There's a bunch of pigs that work here.  That one wasn't a pig.  No, she has a nice body.  And you should hear the banter of these broads around this place.  Broads.  Oh, it is the worst.  Really?  Awful chatter.  Awful chatter.  This one girl was talking to another girl about decorating her apartment.  I'm like, will you shut up?  We're trying to fucking rule the world with this radio thing. 
[00:28:30]  And you're talking about decorating your dumb, tiny little apartment in Brooklyn.  Shut up.  I have some airline stats.  Ah.  Yeah, Danny?  Yeah.  Let's see.  According to some research from 2000, commercial airlines.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's guess.  Because people want to guess.  You got a number?  Well, what number do you want?  Like, what number do you want to guess?  Busiest time?  I don't have busiest.  Because I just have, like, daily and... 
[00:29:00]  You got how many flights or...  I have how many flights per year.  Wait.  So how many flights per year?  We can sort of...  We're going to have to do that.  I know.  I have flights per day.  If you want flights per day, I have that.  In the U.S.  Yeah.  It's sort of...  All right.  But I'm talking about, like, right now, how many people are up in the air?  You have worldwide average.  Let's do that for the day, though.  That's all right.  All right.  How many people you think...  How many flights you think in the air on any given day? 
[00:29:30]  Worldwide or U.S.-wide?  I was up to 10 and I lost count.  Is it worldwide?  Worldwide.  How many flights worldwide?  All right.  I think...  Do you know when you're at an airport and you're, like, 10th in line to take off?  That's one airport in a city that usually has two or three airports.  Mm-hmm.  And they're just constantly taking off.  Every what?  Five minutes?  Not even.  Not even.  Every...  Every couple minutes? 
[00:30:00]  Three minutes, they're flinging off into the air.  And now think of the country.  And then think of the world.  I know.  Let's go.  This is good.  Dude, that is a fuckload of flights.  All right.  Do a little math in your head.  I think in the United States, I think it's close to 20,000 flights a day.  I think.  I think.  Hold on.  Let me think here.  And then there's a couple other big countries out there.  You know what?  I'm going to go with an even one hundred and two thousand, seven hundred and forty-one. 
[00:30:30]  I'll take the same number, seven forty-two.  Price is right rules.  You can't do price is right rules.  I'm going one hundred and two thousand flights.  I'll say.  Wait.  A year or a day?  A day?  Per day, in the air, in the world.  Are they talking Smallcraft, too?  Commercial.  Anything commercial.  Ooh, commercial.  Commercial.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to guess 30,000 flights a day.  I'm going to go 50,000. 
[00:31:00]  Fucking.  Did I overbid?  You might have overbid.  I don't know.  I hope he changes his guess and it's exactly the number he put on to the one.  I'll put it to you this way.  If you come within 10,000, I'll come over there and jerk you off right now.  Oh, boy.  Even if you don't.  All right, Dan.  Well, it says here.  Please, please.  Don't make me look stupid.  Please, please.  Every day.  Please don't make me look stupid.  More than four million people fly on commercial airlines worldwide. 
[00:31:30]  Wait.  More than four million people in the air every day?  But it's worldwide.  One giant airplane.  God was eye off.  Boo.  So each year, that comes out to 1.7 billion people on 25 million flights.  So you do the math.  25 million.  You were way closer.  25 million a year.  That would be about 80,000 a day.  It comes out to 69,444 every day.  Thank you.  I win even by Price is Right rules.  Honestly, that's not a good victory, though. 
[00:32:00]  You're a bit under.  We all were way off.  No, 50,000, I said.  You're off by 19,000.  Yeah, how far were you off?  I was over by one.  I said 70,000.  I was over by 1,000.  Shut up.  Why?  You're over.  By 5,000.  You said 30,000.  No, I didn't.  I said in a 12-hour period, so if you double it, that's 60.  So there's 69,000 people in the air every day?  Every day.  No, if that's flights.  I mean flights, flights, flights, flights.  Yeah, people, it's ridiculous. 
[00:32:30]  So people.  What would be the average?  200 per plane?  Depends.  Because there's a lot.  Nah, not that many.  All right, 100 and.  I would say, I'd say 105 maybe because you have bigger planes, you have a lot of commuter planes.  Safe to say we're pushing 700,000 people in the air every day?  No.  Is that about right?  More than that.  Maybe more?  Yeah.  Somehow, I would think it has to be more.  Picture going through an airport and getting on a plane and the announcements and the blah and all the shit and buckling up. 
[00:33:00]  Just seeing all those people.  There's 68,000 more times that's happening in the world before the next day comes.  We're taking off.  We're going to turn off.  The same shitty pilot voice.  Yeah.  And people aren't at the airport to hang out.  They're going places.  So everyone you see in a crowded airport is fucking going somewhere that day.  That's a good point.  Or they have just come in from somewhere that day.  So repeat that.  Yeah.  In every fucking airport all over the world, that's a lot of goddamn people. 
[00:33:30]  How many people, Dan?  18.  I was reading something else.  I'm going to say 18.  I think in the prime.  I think you're pushing almost 100,000 people in the air.  Prime time flying.  Yeah.  Right?  Do we have the underwater stat?  How many people are underwater?  It might be harder to find since it's confidential military records of submarine personnel. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Underwater.  How many people are on the moon at any given moment?  Oh, and then we've got the spacemen.  Yeah.  How many people are in space?  Let's say hi to Eli in Philly.  Eli.  Come on, guys.  I do have some underwater stats for you.  As of right now, I can guarantee you at a bare minimum there are 268 people underwater. 
[00:34:30]  Oh.  See, that's an Air France joke.  Oh, God.  Very clever, though, my friend.  No, I like Eli's joke.  That's very clever.  He's guaranteeing.  Oh, guaranteeing at least.  I would take that bet.  Oh.  That's not what I see.  You know, that's not bad.  More of a dark sense of humor there.  Let's go to...  Well, Kevin from Connecticut's got the answer.  The answer?  A fuckload.  Yeah.  Rudder from New York. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, and it's around 500,000 if you take out...  If you use all the private planes.  500,000?  If you add private planes in?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know if there's that many.  Wait, 500,000 in the sky at one time during primetime flying?  A day, I'm guessing.  Yeah, 500,000.  Probably a day.  For the whole day?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  This guy runs out of steam quick, doesn't he?  Yeah, he really does. 
[00:35:30]  I actually found a website that graphs real-time air traffic, believe it or not.  I believe it because you're the king of the internet.  Why would you lie about that?  That is your title now.  If you could...  We learned that.  Just give yourself a title and everyone buys into it.  Yeah, I know.  You don't do anything.  Sam calls himself primetime for no apparent reason.  Exactly.  He's not primetime.  We're on in the morning.  Exactly.  How the fuck is that primetime?  A quarter after two, Sam.  Right.  It looks like right now there's about 1,200 flights in the air over the United States. 
[00:36:00]  Right now?  Right now.  Just over the United States.  Only 1,200?  That's a lot of flights for right now.  Yeah.  It's only...  It's not even 7 in the morning, Ian.  I want a lot.  Look at the West Coast right now.  It's fucking...  Yeah, it's still very...  It's the red eye.  You're taking the red eye.  345.  Yeah.  What's the busiest time of day?  Um...  It doesn't...  Well...  Can you sit in front of that until tomorrow and just give us...  Sure.  Just study it.  Yeah.  I want you to know it by heart.  Do you know how many shits are being taken in midair right now? 
[00:36:30]  People do 1,000 flights.  At least...  Let's just say at least 600 of them.  There's at least...  Let's say about 700 shits being taken at 30,000 feet.  All right.  High altitude shits.  If you want to go there, I was in a room recently just bored.  So I was thinking to myself, how long would it take to fill this room up with loads?  I really thought that. 
[00:37:00]  With cum?  Yeah.  I don't even know why.  Like on a worldwide basis or just how long...  Yeah.  So the whole world, for how much cum is being shot out all over the world right now, this  thing would fill up in seconds.  I think it was...  Actually, I was going to say Starbucks, but it wasn't.  It was a coffee shop, and I'm sitting there just bored, and I'm thinking to myself, how  long would it take for this whole coffee shop to be filled to the brim with loads?  And then you got started.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Just started, Jackie.  Get going.  The police arrested him, and he said he was trying to fill the place with cum before  lunch.  Get moving on that.  If all of a sudden something happened in this world that was really weird, where everyone's  splooge converged and started down that hall, how long before a tsunami of splooge hit that  window behind it?  I think it would have to be so fast.  I thought it did, but it was just an executive.  I think these dumb things.  Like, how long do you think?  Like, I'll try to save you by swallowing it all. 
[00:38:00]  Save yourselves.  I'll protect you.  Run for your lives.  I'll wait here.  Like, I mean, you got to think...  In my culottes.  You got to think since six o'clock.  We've been on the air about...  You know, we start a little late.  I mean, we're not stupid.  I mean, come on.  Give us a break.  We've been on the air maybe 45 minutes.  Yeah.  How much fucking cum would be in this room by now from the world's cumming?  I would say you'd be swimming in it.  Really? 
[00:38:30]  You'd be treading cum.  For real?  Yeah, yeah.  Think of all the people that are sploogeing.  Since six o'clock, that's how many people splooge around the world that we would be swimming  in cum already in this cubicle?  No.  Think of it this way.  All right, all right.  Here's a good way to maybe get a fucking vague idea of it.  How many children are squirted out every second on this globe?  All right, pretty much.  In the whole world.  Pretty much.  I don't know.  Now, that's just people... 
[00:39:00]  That's just definite sploogeage.  Right.  Because you got to say, there's a shot of splooge every time one of these babies came out.  At some point.  So that's splooge.  And then all the jerking off.  Right.  All the fucking that doesn't result in pregnancy.  Right.  Like, that's a lot of splooge.  So you got to...  How many times out of, you know, out of every load is a baby made?  I don't know.  It's not that much, dude.  Percentage-wise, I would say it's not that much.  So you take how many babies and then say that's loads. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  How many babies are born every...  But then you got the...  Look at us, stats.  How many babies are born every minute in the world?  Danny?  Hang on.  We're giving Danny quite a workout today.  But every...  Yeah, but then...  You said every second?  Every minute.  Let's go with it.  All right.  But then...  All right.  Then every minute.  Then you'll get it for the hour.  Let's go with an hour.  Yeah.  And then how many times are you coming where it's not making a baby?  Exactly. 
[00:40:00]  And then we can see how fast this room fills up with splooge.  So now you have to think.  This is the type of math I would have taken at school, by the way.  Fuck that stupid trigonometry crap.  Give me real silly questions.  Give me trigonometry.  Yeah.  Give me trigonometry.  The answer, by the way, for babies born per minute in the world is 255.  255 babies born every minute in the world.  All right.  I'm the math guy.  255.  255.  So times 60.  So we got...  I absolutely would have thought that would have been higher. 
[00:40:30]  33.  Every minute?  Every minute.  12, 15.  So 15,300 babies born in an hour.  That's a lot.  15,300.  So we've been on the radio close to an hour.  So we're heading toward 15,300 babies have been born since we started our show.  15,000 loads now.  That's 15,000.  What's the quantity of 15,000 loads, given that each load is probably about a, what, table  school? 
[00:41:00]  Mouthful?  Mouthful.  Steve, come here.  Let's measure.  Oh, he's gay.  Yeah.  Your average load.  Right.  And then we got to get square, cubic footage of this room.  Right.  And then convert it to liquid to gallons.  I just want you to understand that while this is being discussed, this is work for us.  We're being paid for this.  This is our job.  It made me laugh because I'm just sitting there drinking coffee going, all right, like if everyone's 
[00:41:30]  load all of a sudden emptied out into this coffee shop, how long would I have before  I was drowning in the world's splooge?  Right.  In world's splooge.  You don't think this weird shit.  Am I the only one?  You got some sperm quantity stats, Dan?  All right.  I thought I saw some.  The average volume of semen produced is two to five milliliters.  Two to five milliliters.  That metric shit kills me every time.  I'm out.  Let's say three, three.  Three? 
[00:42:00]  You can't go from two to five to three?  Well, he said two to five milliliters.  Oh, two to five milliliters?  Two to five milliliters?  Two to five milliliters.  Two to five milliliters.  So two average would be about two and five.  So three and a half.  Well, now it's three point five.  That adds a decimal.  We're never going to get that done.  Yeah, let's go three.  Let's just go three.  We'll keep it on the low side.  Three liters?  Leaders?  Jesus Christ.  That's got elephants coming and blue whales.  That's horse gag shit.  Three milliliters. 
[00:42:30]  Three milliliters?  Milliliters to ounces conversion coming up.  Oh, boy.  Hang on, hang on.  Help me out with that.  We need ounces.  We need American measurements.  Remember when we were growing up?  We're changing to the metric system.  We're adding to the metric system.  We're all going to have to learn it or we'll be left behind.  And then a year went by and I think it was, was it Carter or someone went into office and  said, this is stupid.  We're not doing metric.  So forget everything you learned in the last year or two.  Don't worry about it.  Garbage.  Right.  All right.  What do we got? 
[00:43:00]  Let's say.  About one ounce?  About 30 milliliters.  Roughly.  What?  30 milliliters is one ounce.  It's one ounce.  So 10 loads.  10 loads.  10 loads.  Is an ounce.  10 loads is an ounce.  All right, so take the, like, fucking zero off the end of it.  No, I'm going with 10 loads equals one ounce.  10 loads is an ounce.  What do you want to call it?  Baby batter, jizz, splooge.  Loads.  All right.  10 loads equals one ounce. 
[00:43:30]  10 loads is an ounce.  How many ounces in a gallon?  I really don't know.  All right.  Let's go.  I really don't know.  There we go.  This shit.  That ounce isn't that fucking metric crap.  Danny's going.  One gallon is 128 ounces.  It's 128 ounces in a gallon.  All right.  So now we're talking 1,280 loads will equal a gallon.  All right.  1,280 loads.  1,280 loads.  Yeah.  Let's go 1,200.  Keep it even.  Equals a gallon. 
[00:44:00]  No, because we're already low-balled.  Oh, okay.  Then round it up.  We could safely round it up to, let's see.  13.  Well, all right.  We'll go 13.  That's a safe roundup.  1,300 loads equals a gallon.  Was it 100 or 1,000?  100.  1,300 loads is a gallon.  Okay.  Wow.  Now take that gallon of cum and just pour it on the floor.  Well, hang on.  Let's only make a little puddle.  We got a long way to go.  We're going to get to the bottom of this. 
[00:44:30]  Because 1 cubic foot is 7, let's just call it 7 1⁄2 gallons.  All right.  So as long as we could find the cubic footage of this room, we have the answer to it.  Wait, wait.  1 cubic foot is 7?  7 point.  Okay.  So there's our answer.  7 gallons?  That would fill this room.  Yeah, because this place is tiny.  Get it to small office or studio.  But you got it, right?  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Whatever.  Hey, how is that?  1 cubic what?  1 cubic foot.  Yeah.  Equals?  7. 
[00:45:00]  It's 7.48, so let's just call it 7 1⁄2 gallons.  That is a 10-gallon fish tank.  7 1⁄2 gallons?  Yeah.  1 cubic foot is 7 1⁄2 gallons.  All right.  We're good now.  All right.  How do you figure out the cubic feet of this place?  Well, that's nice.  We have to measure from there to there, there to there.  Do we have a ruler?  4 times it, and then we'll get the floor space, then we've got to go up the wall to  the ceiling.  Right.  And then multiply it by that. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  We can get that.  We could do this.  Let's get the blueprints, because there's obviously dimensions.  We could do this.  I'm telling you.  Walk it off.  Who's got a...  How about Kenny's big, perfect 12-inch feet?  We're looking at an 8-foot ceiling.  Get Kenny in here.  Is this 8 feet?  Yeah, we're looking at an 8-foot ceiling.  I'm eating egg whites, by the way.  As we talk about this, it's fucking disgusting.  You know what?  I'm 6'5".  There's no way this is.  You're not...  Oh.  6'5".  Sit down.  Sit down, Fred. 
[00:46:00]  Kenny, how big are your feet?  All right, Fred.  He's got this.  Oh, you got that.  We're down here.  All right, we got tape measure.  Now it's an odd shake.  It's fucked up.  But we're going to have to...  We're trying to figure out how long it would take the world to come in it.  It doesn't matter if it's odd.  We're guessing.  All right.  It's a little fucked up, because we've got a little angle thing happening.  All right, Ants...  What do you got over there, Ants?  No, you got to move that thing.  Yeah, that's all right.  I got it.  All right.  We're looking at...  How many feet?  19...  20 feet.  20 feet.  Wow.  Our old studio is about 100, by the way. 
[00:46:30]  By...  Thank you, SiriusXM.  Don't cut yourself, Jimmy.  20 feet.  20 feet by...  What the hell is that?  17.  17.  20 by 17.  Do I have to times that?  Yeah.  That's a bite.  It's probably eight, but you can do it this way.  Here's how we do it in the trades.  See, that's how you do it in the trades.  Yeah, I see that.  That's eight foot ceiling.  All right.  I guess I'm not 6'5", then.  Fuck.  I must be taller. 
[00:47:00]  So 20...  All right.  Now what do I do?  I have 20 times 17.  20 times 17.  And then times eight?  Times eight.  All right.  Let me see.  And that gives you cubic feet.  I got it.  I don't need none of that.  Yeah?  We got 34...  30...  340...  Times eight, I think, right?  Zero.  This is so stupid.  It certainly is.  32.  I'm a math whiz.  How much cum in a gallon?  Ridiculous.  I think we're looking at 2,720 cubic feet. 
[00:47:30]  Okay.  Let me do this without a calculator.  All right.  And then one cubic foot is 7.5 gallons of cum.  Oh, they're both working feverishly at the...  Dr. Kaku would be so proud of you.  Hold on.  You got it?  Yeah, I got it.  All right, hold on.  Like little tadpole people.  10, 13...  Time is a river of semen.  Can I go over here?  14...  Let's say you're eating pudding.  50...  14, 19... 
[00:48:00]  Zero...  Do you got 00 so far at the end?  Yes.  All right.  Do you have another zero?  It's in there somewhere.  Do you have three zeros at the end?  No, not three zeros.  I do.  Uh-oh.  Someone made a fucking...  Someone used a calculator and someone didn't.  Uh-oh.  Is that a four?  Oh, boy.  There's a four in there.  And then another zero?  Yeah, I think you might have...  And then a two?  Yes.  I got...  What are you looking at?  I got 204...  Nah.  Maybe I did mine wrong.  ...thousand gallons. 
[00:48:30]  204...  I've come.  Wait.  ...and 4,000 gallons?  204,000 gallons would fill this room up.  No, no, no, no, no.  You got an extra zero in there somewhere.  It should be 20,400.  What the fuck?  20,000.  Oh, wait.  Oh, decimal point.  Yes, see.  Hold on.  Let me do my decimal point.  That'll fuck things up.  You're right.  Decimal point.  Move that over.  You got 20,400?  20,400 gallons of cum.  Okay, I just didn't move the decimal point.  Fuck.  20,400 gallons of cum.  20,400 gallons of cum fills up this room. 
[00:49:00]  Now, how many loads is that?  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, now we need the load factor.  Well, that's what we were going for.  Well, 10 loads equals an ounce.  Now we're back to that.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  This room is 20,000 gallons?  That doesn't seem right.  Is it?  Wait a gallon.  It does.  Oh, yeah.  10 times two.  All right.  Wait a gallon is 1,300 loads, right?  Okay.  So we go back to that.  Now multiply.  What?  13,000 by how many gallons is in this room? 
[00:49:30]  What?  Oh, I see what you're saying.  So 1,300.  1,300.  Into 20,400, I believe, right?  Times 20,000.  Times.  Right.  All right.  I can do that without a calculate.  1,300 times.  20,400 times 1,300, I think.  Wow.  I actually could do this.  This is a lot of fucking loads.  Zero.  Why is Marsha's son sitting over there?  Who are you?  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  What do you got, Dan?  My brain just exploded. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I'm working on it.  Give me one second.  Oh, Dan's got the calculator up.  Let's see.  We got to figure it out because it sounds like it sounded easy at first.  Now it's a lot of loads.  There's going to be 1,200.  It never sounded easy.  How much come in a room?  1,300.  We're getting to the bottom of it, though, which is good.  1,300 in a gallon.  All those egg whites.  1,300 loads in a gallon, and we're up to 20,400 gallons.  Yeah, but we've got to divide that by three. 
[00:50:30]  Why are we dividing?  Why are you dividing?  We're not splitting it between us.  Because we're trying to find per load, right?  We're trying to find people.  No, we're trying to find how many people, right?  Is that what we're saying?  20,400.  All right, let's think.  20,400 gallons of cotton.  Right, 20,400 gallons of cotton.  Right.  And we're saying that there's 13.  Just do gallons.  1,300 loads in a gallon.  So that's 1,300 people per gallon.  So you have to do 1,300 times 20,400.  You know how bad that would smell? 
[00:51:00]  Imagine putting your nose over the container, how bad that would smell.  13,000 times the amount of gallons in this room.  Right.  Why am I the only one that thinks this shit?  You don't think weird shit when you're just hanging around?  Oh, yeah, coffee shop.  But this is the worst discussion ever had on a radio show.  No one actually does the math to figure it out.  No one actually gets on a computer and says, all right.  And takes out tape measures, measures the room.  But the other thing I was thinking was how fast would you just be drowning and come? 
[00:51:30]  Or would it be slow enough where you'd be like, you know what, I think I'd better leave this coffee shop.  It's filling up with come way too fast.  Or would it be just instant?  It's a deluge of come, right.  All right.  The shining door is opening.  All right.  How many guys coming would fill up this room with come?  How many guys would it take?  If the number is correct, which is the 1,300 times the amount of gallons, which is 20,400, well, 20,400,  it comes out to 265,200,000. 
[00:52:00]  265,000,000 loads?  I'm starting to get confused now, too.  Yeah, that's how many loads it would take to fill up this room.  1,300 times, and then we're doing the 20,400, 20,400.  It would have to be 265,200.  You didn't say million in there, right?  You did say million.  Yeah, you did.  Yeah, I don't think that's right.  You did.  But I think more than 200,000 loads.  No, I'm sorry.  It's 26 million.  26,520,000.  A 26 million loads. 
[00:52:30]  No, how do you get loads?  Oh, 200.  Oh, okay.  That sounds right.  Wait, say that again.  26 million.  Just call it 26 and a half million.  Loads.  Yeah, 26 and a half million.  No, because we only have 20,400, right?  Yeah.  Divided by 1,300?  No, times.  No, it's times.  I mean times, times, right.  1,300.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That about works.  Okay, you're right.  It's a lot of loads.  So that is a lot of loads. 
[00:53:00]  Now, to figure out how many people are actually coming in the world is impossible.  That's our variable we cannot retrieve.  By the way, Keith in Niagara, or Niagara, yeah, Niagara, Niagara, is it a country or is it  Buffalo?  N-I-A-G-A-R-A?  Yeah.  Which one is it?  Niagara.  Okay.  Opie equals worst daydream ever. 
[00:53:30]  Worst daydreamer ever.  That's his formula.  What the fuck?  What the fuck, man?  Well, I guess we got to the bottom of that.  Pretty much.  That's a lot of loads.  A lot of loads.  We'd be drowning in cum.  Ugh.  But I don't think it would be very quick.  No.  As quick as I thought.  Yeah, it would if they did it all at the same time.  That's my point.  With a big funnel.  No, I was thinking...  I want a big, huge funnel in the ceiling and they have to come up. 
[00:54:00]  Dude, it would fill up instantaneously if they all came at the same time.  We just know how much it would take to fill it up.  We don't know how long it would take the world just going about its business to fill this  room up.  That's crazy.  That's a lot.  Would it just be a splat here?  Hmm?  Would it just be like...  That's what I was...  Like rapid fire, but it's not that much.  That's what I was daydreaming.  How would the room fill up, too?  How long would it be?  Would it be, like I said, like a river? 
[00:54:30]  Would it be a tsunami?  Would it be just a heavy rainstorm of cum?  I think...  I'm saying heavy rainstorm.  Yeah?  Heavy, heavy rainstorm.  But even that would take quite a while to fill the room up.  By the way, this is something I really thought.  Just because I was bored.  All right.  One guy hung up.  He said, this sounds like the calculations they were doing during the Apollo 13 movie.  We need...  All right.  Check your figures.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  We don't want to get in a gimbal lock and have...  Yeah.  A gimbal lock.  It'd come on our heads.  It'd come up our nose.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, well.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Charlie Dick wrote 26,520,000.  Charlie Dick.  Commas?  Help?  Oh, whatever.  People are figuring it out.  Yeah.  Well, do the math yourself now.  I think we gave you enough to go on.  Yeah.  Rob in Virginia. 
[00:55:30]  Way to get the gay out of the show, boys.  Let me say hi to Nick in Jersey.  Nick.  Hey, Ope.  Hey.  You're scaring me.  I was thinking about this for years.  Is there a steady flow of cum constantly?  As we're talking, having this whole conversation, somebody's coming.  When that guy's done cumming, somebody else is going to cum it.  I would think there's a steady flow.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The cum flow never stops. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Never stops.  Thank you for...  But how wide is the stream?  Yeah.  That's what you got to worry about.  How about this one?  Let's say we all had to cum in the cum river.  Would that river be more impressive than the Mississippi River?  Wow.  Would it be...  I don't know.  Would it just be a little stream?  Would it be a torrential, like whitewater rafting river? 
[00:56:30]  What are you going to say to the Rapids?  Colorado.  To quote Lewis and Clark when they found the Mississippi River, that's a lot of loads.  And would you bring your family to check out the cum river on summer vacation?  Yeah.  You'd have to take pictures of it.  Yeah.  That's how fathers figure out things.  If your kid's leaning over the side of the rap with his mouth open, you've got a lot  of work to do.  Oh, and hey, little Jimmy, you guys are the best.  Nick, you really have thought this weird shit, too?  Oh, my God.  For years.  Oh, good.  All my buddies thought I was sick. 
[00:57:00]  Good.  I'm not alone.  I'm good to know there's somebody else out there like me.  I'm not alone because I try to wrap my mind around how many fucking people are living  and then you start putting weird shit together and you go, this is insane.  You can't even think about it.  It is more a test on or just kind of trying to get an education, trying to get your finger  on how many people are actually on the world and put it in some kind of a thing you can  understand. 
[00:57:30]  Cum going down a river.  You know what blows my mind?  You walk around all day.  We live in a huge city, New York City.  Why don't you ever see one lousy person wearing the exact same shirt you're wearing?  It happens, but it's so fucking rare.  So how many different fucking shirts are they making on a daily basis?  That's weird to me.  We're doing calculations for the count.  Did you include Peter North in that equation?  Well, that's a good point.  And Cum.  Why Peter North was a lot of star?  Load kid.  He's the load kid?  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, thank you, sir.  We're going to go to Megan.  She used to work at an underwater hotel.  You guys are making me ill, first of all.  And second of all, I'm at work now and I can't talk.  It's too late.  I sat through that whole conversation.  Wait, Megan.  Oh, no.  Why are you ill?  Just because we learned that.  What's the number again?  It's a little early to be picturing a room full of that.  All right.  Hold on.  What's the number?  26.  26 and a half million. 
[00:58:30]  26 and a half million guys coming would fill up this room.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, let's line up whores.  How many whores would it take to suck the cum out of this fucking room?  Oh, God.  Now, you got to think.  Jesus.  You know, some of these whores could take a mouthful.  They're not just going to take a little lick.  Wow.  They're going to fucking, they're going to be troopers.  I am a high school biology teacher, so now I have my teenagers streaming into the room.  So, unfortunately, I can't really do it. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, well.  Maybe you can start testing that theory we have.  Dan.  All right.  Now, we got a room that's got two.  What is it again?  I got to write this number down.  Two million.  Wait, what?  Is this two million, what, 652,000 loads?  No, it's 26 million.  26 and a half million loads.  All right.  Yeah.  26 and a half million loads.  Okay.  How many whores would it take to suck the cum out of the room?  26 and a half million. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  I would think, you know, one load per person.  Yeah.  Some of these.  Ah, come on.  No, I think what Opus is saying is that one mouth can handle more than one load.  Yes.  One mouth lining up going, all right, I'll take.  You mean mouthfuls.  Yes.  I'll take my share.  Oh, boy.  This is more goddamn fluid math.  Well, now, what's the temperature?  Because is it beginning to coagulate?  Jimmy, take a mouthful of water.  I don't want to be like a pig.  Like an average mouthful of water.  Not until you're like, you know.  Okay.  And then spit it into something.  And we'll see how many ounces that is. 
[01:00:00]  And then we'll divide that by all the loads.  And we can find out how many whores it would take to get the cum out of the room.  Got to clean up the fucking cum after your experiment.  Yeah, but that doesn't count the stuff that would be stuck to the walls behind the computers.  Okay.  All right, Megan.  Yes.  You worked at an underwater hotel.  What's that about?  And where was it?  Underwater.  Florida, Florida.  The Atlantis Hilton.  Look at this. 
[01:00:30]  Look at this.  Amish bitch.  What is she doing here?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know, but her ponytail is swinging back and forth.  Look how long the skirt is.  What the fuck are you doing?  She's got long legs.  How can you tell?  The skirt's long.  That's what?  It's one of the Martha girls.  You shut up.  You said that right into the microphone.  So, Kenny thinks whispering, you know, doesn't pick that by the mic.  Hello, hello.  Don't tell anybody. 
[01:01:00]  Don't.  That's the boss's daughter.  I'm sexually attracted to you.  But, Kenny, my son.  Oh, oh.  Not you.  Megan, where was this hotel?  In the Florida Keys.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  And it was just really funny because they had brochures that made it look all beautiful  with, you know, with tropical fish swimming by and beautiful, clear waters.  And if you go there, it's actually in this lagoon that's kind of algae-covered and really  dark.  And you can only see, like, a foot in front of your face. 
[01:01:30]  And you go down there, and it's all, like, moist and steel and, like, being in a sub.  And they charge $300 a night.  Where was this again?  In the Keys.  How far down did you go?  Yeah.  How far underwater?  It's, like, 20 feet.  20 feet underwater.  20 feet underwater.  20 feet.  Now, how did you get to work every day?  A little submarine?  Well, I was a marine biology instructor, so I didn't work in the hotel, but I went down  there a lot.  And it was, um, no, you have to scuba dive down.  You have to scuba dive down.  Oh, really?  You don't have, like, a secret little, like, passage that no one really sees where you're 
[01:02:00]  just kind of going downstairs?  No.  It's just, like, this steel box sunk in the middle of the lagoon that you have to swim  down to.  That sucks.  It's really small.  It's small, and they make it sound like this amazing underwater resort.  Wait, that's how the fucking, uh, uh, people, the guests get there, too?  Yeah.  Well, how do you get your luggage in?  Well, you really want to know?  They have, like, uh, you know how those waterproof, like, uh, bags that they have for, like,  underwater cameras?  They bring all your luggage down in, like, one of those snap-tight, water-tight box things. 
[01:02:30]  And then what do you do in there?  You sit there, and you look at, like, the two little sad fish that swim by in a couple  hours, and you talk to each other, and you say, wow, we're underwater in a hotel, and  we're going to sleep here.  Is there a restaurant?  No, the guy who's, like, this one guy who takes care of it, and he's, like, this crazy  old guy with a white mustache.  He swims down, and he cooks you this little meal.  Like, he brings down his raw steak in the, um, in the water-tight suitcase, and he cooks 
[01:03:00]  you a little meal down there.  And, like, what, a hot plate?  Yeah.  And how do you breathe down there?  Like, how do they pump the fresh air down there?  Um, there's actually, like, tubes that go down.  Like, you can see the tubes, and you can see the bubbles going down to it if you're on the  side of the lagoon.  I think we're seeing it here.  Is it called Jules Undersea Lodge?  Yes, yes.  All right.  We're looking at a 42-inch window.  Wow.  There's, look at that. 
[01:03:30]  That's your room?  Let me see it.  There's a round porthole by the bed, and it looks very green out there.  Yes, it's, yeah, they make it look great, yeah.  How many rooms are in this hotel?  It's one little tiny bedroom and one little living area kitchen.  Wait, that's the whole hotel?  Yeah.  That's a fucking, it's a one-room hotel?  It's like a little box.  I'm kidding.  He's kidding, man.  That stinks!  Only one, only one occupant? 
[01:04:00]  If you're going underwater, don't you want the whole experience?  You go to the bar, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you talk to people, you're like, wow, we're underwater.  You're walking down hallways where you can see outside?  Yeah.  Yeah, if you look at the blueprint, it really, it looks, it even looks bigger in the blueprint,  but it's just not.  It's really like being in a tiny little sub.  And they put a little stuffed fish in every picture to make it look cozy.  Look at it.  Yeah, it's, it is the entryway, the wet room, and that's like not part of the living quarters. 
[01:04:30]  Then there's bedroom one and bedroom two, and then common room with microwave, refrigerator,  TV, VCR, DVD, stereo.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, they have all the little stuff, just like being on a boat.  Everything's really small and everything's got in its little nook and stuff.  This could be the dumbest, worst place ever.  Yeah.  Ever.  Oh, you worked there.  That's. 
[01:05:00]  How was the pay?  Oh, I didn't get, I got paid like $10,000 a year or something.  Oh, shit.  Jules Undersea Lodge sucks a day.  It's awful.  It's horrendous.  How, how sweaty you think your room is?  Ah, dude.  Just the moisture everywhere.  How many tourist farts have been cut in that room that went nowhere?  It can't go anywhere.  It doesn't vent.  You could fill that up with eight people's jizz.  Actually, they, um, because I worked there, I could have stayed there anytime I wanted for 
[01:05:30]  free and people would visit me like my friends would visit me and we never even did it once  because I would take them down and show it to them and they'd be like, uh, no, sorry.  Did it, did it smell all like musty and, and, and like, totally like an old bilge to a ship?  It totally did.  It was like dripping inside and it was all just kind of feel and yeah.  Oh, that's horrible.  $4.75 a night per person?  Per night.  Oh, they brought it down.  They must not be getting that many people.  Wow. 
[01:06:00]  Per person.  So if you want to, you know, you're not going to be there alone.  You'll take a, uh, somebody with you.  So you're talking $1,000 per person.  You know, there's a, there's a worse hotel, you know, right?  Yeah.  The ice hotels they make.  Oh yeah.  Those look stupid.  How the fuck do you stay warm in those things?  Those are much to, uh.  Where they carve the entire hotel out of ice, like the bar area, the balloons.  I'm going to think of how all the jizz would just totally freeze.  Yep.  That is the dumbest hotel ever.  The underwater one though. 
[01:06:30]  You don't like it?  Hey, I got to go guys.  It's been fun.  Oh, okay.  Megan.  Don't have sex with students.  We loved, uh, talking to girls anytime.  Call us.  Are there any bigger hotels underwater though?  Like real hotels?  This guy lives a block from the underwater hotel.  This is what I love about a national radio show.  Breeze in the Keys.  What's up, Breeze?  Hey guys.  Yeah.  When I was a little kid, I used to jump down there and throw weights and try to swim down  and bang on the windows.  Imagine if you're fucking, you see a little knuckle knocking. 
[01:07:00]  It's just, it's ugly as sin.  You can't see.  It looks like.  Hello?  Did we lose you?  You said it was in a shitty lagoon.  Yeah.  And you can't see.  All right.  Call back if you can.  Todd the Trucker.  Todd.  Hey, how's it going guys?  Hey.  I just called to tell you when I was a kid, uh, saved all my loads in a mason jar to see  how long it would take to fill it.  And the answer, the answer, 43 days.  43 days? 
[01:07:30]  43 days.  I would say you were jerking off a lot.  Every day.  Did you, Jimmy's getting all nauseous.  Did you then just pour it over your head in the shower as a goof?  No, it was like a hard thing of lard.  It was like a fucking can of smelly lard.  It's like that jar of mayonnaise you forgot you left out after making a ham and cheese sandwich.  This is horrible.  It's all just crusty dried.  Uh, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mark in Toronto.  Mark? 
[01:08:00]  This is one of the most riveting conversations you guys have ever had.  I love it.  Yes, thank you.  This is the reason I almost got kicked out of college was because my, my, one of my roommates  and I decided that we would do a paper on the viscosity of semen.  And what if our major waterways had the same viscosity as semen?  So the Niagara Falls would flow at one-nineteenth the speed.  You wouldn't be able to walk on it, but if you lied down, you'd be able to roll across a river made out of semen. 
[01:08:30]  And you could roll across a river.  There's no fucking way, man.  Come on.  And we were...  I'm silly.  Where do you think that comes from?  Rolling on the river.  This guy rules.  He figured it out.  Have you ever seen...  Wait, you could actually float down a river of cum?  You wouldn't need a boat if you were lying flat because the amount of service that your body was touching would be enough.  The viscosity and density of semen would be able to keep you afloat.  Sure. 
[01:09:00]  That makes sense.  Cum river.  Would it be like putting cornstarch in water?  Yeah, when you put cornstarch in water and mix it up.  Same idea.  And the dean, when we got in shit after handing the paper in, was kind of cool with it, thought it was humorous,  until he asked us how we figured out what the actual density and viscosity of semen was.  And then we had to admit that we did jerk off in one of the labs and test it at the school.  Oh, boy.  So that's against school policy, I would gather. 
[01:09:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Peace out, boys.  Thank you, buddy.  Did you say happy birthday?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Oh, it's not so hard.  One of these fucking times, sweetheart.  All right, hold on a minute.  Wow, that one worked out.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Uh-oh.  We might have lost our clip at.  No.  Find it.  Hey, where are the white women at?  What?  Oh, God.  Damn, what happened?  But it's our birthday.  Only your birthday. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  We've got a lost our famous clip already.  What is that?  We're watching a clip of guys running across a pool of water with cornstarch in it.  Wow.  And it's a weird thing that happens when it's pressurized like that.  It gets very solid.  Cornstarch?  Yeah.  Wait, I'm confused.  How deep is that pool?  It's very deep.  It's as deep as people's hips.  No.  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't get that one.  They're running on the water.  Yeah, they're running on top of water because when they smash their feet down on top of 
[01:10:30]  it, if they just stood there, they'd sink.  So imagine if the whole ocean was made with cornstarch.  You just had to jog in place to not drown?  Yeah, yeah.  You could just run around.  But then all the fish would die.  Fuck the fish.  We talked about them earlier.  They suck anyway.  Yeah, but I like eating them.  Love my fish.  Fish.  Fish.  That is really cool.  Where do you want to go?  Seven billion people in the world so the room would fill instantly?  Well, that's if everybody was jerking off. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, you've got to understand.  Some people have to go to work.  I just sank in it now.  I used to mail loads to my girlfriend.  You want that call?  Ha ha.  Email loads.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason.  Good evening.  Hi.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, boys.  This is pre-internet.  And that's how we showed love to each other.  I would jerk off on a photo or a piece of paper, fold it up, and mail it to her.  And she would send me back like a dum-dum that she had inserted into an orifice or so. 
[01:11:30]  And we would enjoy each other that way.  You rock.  Fucking pneumonia, idiot.  Right now he's growing hooves and oinking.  We all know what he has.  Yeah, really?  Pneumonia.  Come on.  Let's go.  She said my loads were brown by the time that she got them.  Oh, Jesus.  Fuck.  You wonder why fucking postal employees are shooting each other.  That's hot, ain't it?  That's hot.  No.  Take care, boys.  All right, Brown Lode. 
[01:12:00]  All right, we got it.  About the jizz.  All right, we're moving on.  We gave our equations to a math guy.  All right.  So he's going to help us out here.  Kevin in South Carolina.  Kevin.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, I got your calculation using the world's population for how long it would take to fill the room.  Okay.  All right.  If you got 3 billion men in the world, because, you know, that's half the population, minus the children that, of course, don't have any loads, it would take 126 minutes to fill the room.  126 what? 
[01:12:30]  To fill that room, 127 minutes.  127 minutes if everybody was.  So if every able-bodied male.  Every capable guy was whacking off in this room.  In the world.  It would take just over two hours to fill this thing to the brim.  Because like Anthony said, some of us have to go to work, and we're not doing it all at the same time.  So the tippity-tops.  Right.  So if we have to divide it up, 127 minutes.  127 minutes.  A little over two.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  So the answer will be he would have plenty of time to waddle his ass out the door.  Yeah, you could get out.  Right.  Well, if, all right, so now we've been on since 6.  We're an hour and 15 minutes, hour and 20 minutes into our show.  We only have 40 some odd minutes left to get out of here before we would drown and come.  I'd see how far up the wall it would be.  Wow.  You're about nipple deep right now.  Wow.  You're about nipple deep.  I want to know when we'd be up at the ceiling going, with like jizz getting in your mouth. 
[01:13:30]  Taking our last breath before we did the Poseidon Adventure swim to safety.  Yes, the Poseidon Adventure swim.  Of course, if you leave Norton alone in the room, it'll only take like another 30 minutes.  Why, sir?  Uh-oh.  Why?  What's wrong with Norton?  Nothing's wrong.  You're saying because I make a lot of ejaculations?  Oh.  Yeah.  I love it.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'll accept that.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  What's up? 
[01:14:00]  You called us.  Yeah, I just turned you guys on, and you fuckers, man.  I'm trying to eat my bowl of cereal.  How much cream of wheat?  All I can think of is a nice bowl of calm I'm eating now.  Jesus.  Sorry, sir.  Glad we can inspire you.  Let's go to Mike in Maine.  Mike?  Uh, yeah.  I was just watching Ghostbusters 2 last night, and I kind of figured the river would come  and kind of look like, you know, when they're trying to measure the river of slime, and it 
[01:14:30]  comes up and grabs and fucking hauls them into the river.  I hear you.  I'm feeling it.  I'm feeling it, too, sir.  All right.  I just hauled them in my head.  Very good.  How about enough come talk?  Yeah.  The president just landed in Saudi Arabia.  Did he pick a fucking place that hates us more to go?  And look at that airport.  That's an amazing plane.  Place sucks.  Have a nice Air Force One plane there just in that shithole.  Mm-hmm.  He's making friends. 
[01:15:00]  He's making friends.  Yeah, he's making friends.  He's making friends around the world.  Get out and start kissing ass over there, too.  Oh, by the way.  Enough.  We can talk about that after the break and see what else is going on in the world.  He just pulls right up to the carpet.  I love the service he gets.  Why don't we get that service?  Obama never gets...  Ladies and gentlemen, our gate is full right now.  Our gate is actually taken up by another aircraft.  We're going to sit out here on the taxiway and wait for an undetermined amount of time.  Sit tight.  Keep your seatbelt on. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  I hate when the goddamn gate is taken.  We got here early.  We got here early!  How about this one?  Have you ever gotten to the gate?  And it's full of jizz?  But it's full of jizz.  So you've got to get your goulashes on.  You've got to put your luggage in watertight containers and get into the under-jizz hotel.  Imagine God figured out this whole earth thing except for the jizz problem and the jizz had to always be around. 
[01:16:00]  It would be like a river.  Have you ever been up to the door thing?  Yeah.  You're literally five feet from fucking leaving the plane, but they can't figure out the door thing?  When the person can't drive it?  Yeah, and you're sitting there.  I once took a real late-night flight back, and I guess they had just like part-timers or something.  We sat looking at the door thing that was right there for close to an hour before they could figure out how to move it next to the plane so you could deplane. 
[01:16:30]  Just let us off.  I'll jump.  Yeah, get a fucking ladder.  All right, we're going to take a break when we get back.  25 kid shows that must have been created by adults on drugs.  How cool is that list?  Most of these lists suck, but I think we're going to have fun with that one.  We talked about cum, by the way, for probably an hour and 15 minutes.  Oh, no, we talked about planes at first.  Well, then maybe we should continue talking about cum.  I'm sorry we didn't give it enough time. 
[01:17:00]  And we got a weird story about a guy robbing a bodega slash convenience store type place, and the result is so weird.  Yeah.  I don't know what to think about this.  I call him stupid.  Yeah.  I think I might be with you on that, Ant.  We'll explain after the break.  It's a great story here in New York.  MTV writer, did he admit that the Bruno stunt was fake, did he? 
[01:17:30]  Oh, did he?  Did he?  Did he?  We'll find out.  And other things.  I haven't even really looked at the prep sheet yet.  Obviously, we've been talking about jizz for an hour and a half.  Trust me.  That wasn't on the prep sheet.  Trust me.  It was all over it.  We'll entertain the shit out of you after the break.  I guarantee that much.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Oh, no way.  Wow, wow.  And help me sing this one.  I hate the doors.  Come on.  Not Peace Frog. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, I'm not a big Peace Frog fan.  Why?  Why?  I don't like it.  This isn't like one of the door songs they played a million times on the radio.  Nah, it's just played a lot.  Peace Frog wasn't played a lot.  I just hate the stupid thing.  They did the keyboard and everything.  I don't like the doors.  You take the next one.  I don't think the vocals are kicking in any time. 
[01:18:30]  That's what sucks about these things.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Just quickly, because people are confused.  I really am trying to give away $10,000 of my own money.  Oh, are you?  We're not making it like a big show thing.  It's a thing.  It's a thing I'm doing.  But I did release a dollar. 
[01:19:00]  Some old lady in Times Square picked it up.  She has no idea that it's worth $10,000 that she could get a hold of me.  Didn't even know.  She didn't even know.  What a dunce.  Wait a minute.  How did you do it?  How did you market?  It's a serial number thing.  And I'm on to the counterfeiters already, so don't even fucking try.  Because if you decide to try to counterfeit the bill and give it to me, guess what?  Prosecute it to the full extent of the law.  Thank you, Anthony.  Exactly.  Wait a minute. 
[01:19:30]  You'll fall for the trap.  You will be arrested.  You will be arrested.  I love having a contest where people can be arrested.  You will be arrested.  So you Twittered a dollar.  I saw the video.  Yeah.  The new video?  No.  Where the old broad picked it up and then goes, it worked out perfect for me.  I went to Times Square.  I dropped off this dollar bill.  It's now worth $10,000 of my money.  There's other things that might be involved with this contest.  My money.  My money.  So some old lady has it. 
[01:20:00]  So wait a minute.  So let's just say.  See, the whole thing is there's a dollar bill out there.  Yeah, the old lady picked it up.  But did she spend the dollar?  Is the dollar bill now somewhere else?  And she had a southern accent.  So did she leave New York City with the dollar?  So let's just say the lady here, she spends the dollar.  Yeah.  She goes into a bodega and she buys whatever old ladies buy.  Hopefully a headstone.  And she gives it to the savage behind the counter.  Right. 
[01:20:30]  Three minutes later, a man with terrible underarm odor and an uncircumcised penis walks in.  Yeah.  And buys whatever product he does.  We know it won't be breath mints.  Right.  And then he gets on a plane because he's on his way to JFK.  Right.  And then he flies to whatever country he lives in.  That dollar's gone forever.  Whoa.  So unless they're twittering in West Africa or France or Cuba.  That's the beauty of me.  That's the beauty of me.  I don't think.  I'm starting to think maybe this never gets found again. 
[01:21:00]  But who knows?  That's true.  I have.  Okay.  But who knows?  Here's what I'm doing.  I have a dollar.  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this worth three million.  Same thing.  Except I'm just going to keep it.  But I released the dollar in Times Square.  And the beauty of the video that I filmed, an old lady waddles up to the dollar that I just dropped pretty much in the middle of Times Square, picks it up, and she's all excited. 
[01:21:30]  And at the end of the video, she says, what did she say?  Too bad it isn't a hundred.  She goes, ah, why couldn't it be a hundred?  Not knowing that it's worth $10,000.  Yeah.  She just picks it up.  Look at her with a stupid old lady, too short pants.  And people are like, why didn't you show?  Oh, God.  Look at my Steve's pants.  I found a dollar.  Yeah, they look kind of like capri pants.  And people are like, why didn't you show the old lady?  I'm like, because I don't want the old lady getting mugged.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  You can tell it's an old lady.  She picked up the dollar that I dropped in Times Square that's now worth $10,000.  When you dropped it, no one said, hey, sir, you dropped the dollar or you dropped money or you dropped something.  No, I kind of walked out of the area quickly.  I saw you kind of, you like, put it behind you and you let go.  I just dropped it, yeah, and just kept walking.  I didn't hear anyone say that.  No.  No.  So there you go.  It's my little silly contest.  How great would it be if she had just picked it up and walked right over and said, hi, Ope, hand me the cash.  Oh, shit.  Dude, could you imagine that? 
[01:22:30]  If somebody, like, was there that knew that you and. . .  I did film another version.  A just-in-case version where you run away with a. . .  And I swear this is true.  Maybe the guy could call because he does follow me on Twitter.  I dropped the dollar bill and I was hoping there. . .  It was kind of windy in Times Square, so I was hoping the dollar would just fly away.  It literally dropped at my feet.  The guy next to me picks it up. 
[01:23:00]  I'm still filming.  And all of a sudden he goes, holy shit, Opie, what's up?  And then actually said to me, are you Twittering?  And then handed the dollar bill back to me.  Holy shit.  So what you just said almost happened.  Wow.  Swear to God, that is a true story.  And if the guy is listening, maybe he'll call in to verify my. . .  Hey, by the way.  Yeah.  So the video is on Opie Radio on YouTube. 
[01:23:30]  We're not going to spend much time on this on air.  It's just one of my dumb things I'm doing.  That's close.  Because I'm bored.  Bored to shit.  Bored to tears.  When we're not doing cum calculations.  God, Opie's idea sucks.  Great contest, asshole.  I don't know.  I mean, the fact is. . .  That's the guy that picked up the dollar and gave it back to you.  You want the . . .  Fuck.  Yeah.  Sucks.  The fact is, I'm telling you, mark my word, it's not. . .  If you find that fucking dollar, I will give you $10,000. 
[01:24:00]  I will.  Taking that chance.  And you'll get to see Opie cry.  Yeah, well.  As he's doing it.  God damn, you're right.  $100, $200.  No, I'll do it with dollars.  $1.  Yeah.  $2.  Hope you've got plenty of time, asshole.  Right, hoping he just gives up and goes, look, all right, $500 is enough.  $628 of my money. 
[01:24:30]  All right, moving on.  But I just had to clarify, because people are like, no, yeah, you find the dollar, I'll  give you $10,000.  Anthony, this bodega story.  Yes.  Was that out on Long Island, right?  I don't know.  Was it?  I think so.  Was that one of the. . .  Every time I hear about a gun story on Long Island, I instantly think of you.  I know.  For real.  Yeah, me too.  For real.  Like, oh, fuck, Ian had to go get toothpaste, and he got himself in a situation. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, no.  I'd only get in a situation if I wasn't armed, my friend.  I got a letter yesterday from the NRA.  Well, you know, they sent a lot of mailers out.  Yeah.  And this one was filling out a survey of laws that you don't agree with in New York State  and legislation that's trying to come up for, you know, banning things, of course.  And I fill those out all the time in mail them in.  But the letter that came with it, it was so funny, because it kind of had this little  personalized edge to it, but you know it wasn't.  And it said, let's say, because I don't want to say what town I live in, let's say I lived 
[01:25:30]  in Comac.  But you don't live in Comac.  I don't live in Comac.  All right.  Do another one.  Do another one, because that's crazy.  All right.  You would never live in Comac.  Let's say I lived in East Northport.  Yeah, but you don't live in East Northport.  Yeah, but we're going to get to the town I live in, and that's not what I want to do.  Oh!  See, I just want to, like, say what the letter said in the context without actually giving  away, you know, the town, even though a lot of people know where I live.  Main town, USA. 
[01:26:00]  Yes, your town, any town.  It said, it was this whole thing on protecting you, your family, your right to protect yourself  if you're in your car, your right to not be persecuted or prosecuted by attorneys that  are representing the criminal that was trying to hurt you when you use deadly force on  them, get sued by them or their family and things like that, all kinds of stuff like  that.  And then it said, Anthony Cumia, in the letter, it said, Anthony Cumia, we hope you never have 
[01:26:30]  to deal with a problem like this at your home in East Northport.  But you don't live in East Northport.  I know!  That was my example.  Oh, oh.  It had my real hometown.  So they try to personalize it by me going, well, there it is.  It's writing me a personal letter.  And then I'm looking closely to see if maybe the type is a little darker.  Right.  And I know.  And of course it was.  Oh, it was?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Fuck.  Different.  You thought you got the personal touch, right?  I knew the guy didn't actually type me out a letter.  Jesus, come on.  That sucks.  Yeah.  But, yeah, that's my latest gun thing.  Sending more letters out to legislators.  Yeah.  I was going to say this is the video of the day.  Every day there has to be a video of the day, right?  Yeah.  The news is all over that.  But now I'm starting to think the lady that decided to kill herself, where was that?  In Israel?  Yes.  Israel, thumbs up from Dan, decides she's going to kill herself. 
[01:27:30]  She lays down on the train tracks, basically.  And then the train runs completely over her without hitting her.  And then the train's gone.  And then you see this lady get up and walk away.  Stands up.  Walks off the tracks.  Done.  The whole thing was a bet.  It's a pretty good video.  Once you've been trying to kill yourself and you lay down and realize you're not on the rails,  getting cut in half, you've got enough time to raise your head up and get a good clunking.  I think that'll do the trick.  I would straddle the rail. 
[01:28:00]  Would you just go for the instant, like, decapitation?  Ball shot.  Decapitation?  No, instant ball shot.  Oh, you mean like...  Oh, yeah.  You mean, like, one leg over, one rail?  Fuck that.  And lean backwards.  You'd be cut in half.  It's going to fucking kill yourself.  What if it just cuts your leg off and knocks you?  What if it just go all in?  Slice your leg off and push you.  You might live.  Go all in.  You might live.  You've got to have strong abs.  What about head first?  Or how about just your neck on the fucking rail?  Neck on the rail.  Instant. 
[01:28:30]  That's instant.  You lay across two ways.  Nice.  You lay with your neck on one rail and your feet on the other one, even though you don't  really need your feet on there.  It'll just be funny to be found without feet.  Yeah.  Where is this man's feet?  I found two shoes.  Mystery solved.  They call you the hat shoe case.  But, yeah, you know how I thought I would do it?  I figured I would...  I said if I was ever going to kill myself on a train...  Because when I was in Long Island doing a book signing, me and Kenny were standing over  the LIE looking right down on trains as they came. 
[01:29:00]  So you're above them, but you could see the train coming and the...  Yeah, yeah.  You could feel it.  I'm like, I would be dead right now.  And I figured I would stand on the tracks and lean forward with my head, almost like  I was in a football hike position.  Oh, wow.  So it struck the top of my head.  It would smash your head.  Your head would be just...  It would explode.  But you're not getting cut apart like you are, but I mean, you're dead by the time you  get cut apart.  No open casket for you. 
[01:29:30]  No.  No.  No.  There's not many ways to die with a train hitting you where they can have an open casket.  Yeah.  Unless maybe, you know, you get cut in half at the abdomen, and then they just kind of  pull the blanket up on you.  They pull up a little blankie in the coffin.  Did I ever tell you about the last tenant at my parents' house?  No.  Oh, maybe you did.  Did I?  Did I say it on the show or off air?  Did he get hit by a train?  Did I...  You could tell him, Gregory. 
[01:30:00]  It's okay.  No.  My parents...  I think I told you guys that, you know, one of at least seven kids, but like I've told  in the past, sometimes they're up to nine or ten living with us.  I don't know why.  Depending on, yeah, who was getting kicked out of their house, and then one of us would  run away.  So it was the weirdest...  You couldn't figure it out.  Right.  And then when we started going off to college and leaving this big house, my parents decided  to make a little extra money, and they would get tenants when it was still legal. 
[01:30:30]  By the way, it's really hard to rent a room on Long Island right now.  Really?  It's almost impossible.  They got all sorts of new laws and rules and stuff.  No, you can't advertise it anymore.  Why?  Like a penny saver and all that.  I don't know.  Some weird fucking loophole.  Because there's a lot of people out there, you know, with the mortgage payments and stuff.  Rooms for rent.  You can't advertise that anymore.  That's a big thing for a lot of people on Long Island.  I know that.  Because you got the big mortgage and, you know, you got extra rooms.  You're like, fuck, this is some nice income that'll help me out. 
[01:31:00]  Anyway.  Fucking governments just gotta get their hands in your pocket, right?  We have...  Got you by the purse strings.  One woman who actually found me on Twitter recently, she used to rent a room for my parents,  and I think she was the one that OD'd in the woods.  And we found her completely out, turning blue.  Me and my brothers.  Actually, I wasn't in on that one.  I can't take credit.  But a couple of my brothers found her turning blue, and we saved her.  She OD'd in the woods.  Then we had the guy that was into drugs and stole our brand new bicycles. 
[01:31:30]  Then we had a third guy that was burning a crack in his room, so all our spoons had the burn marks.  And then the final...  Any reference checks on these people?  No reference check?  You're just...  My dad.  Just let him in, huh?  God rest his soul with Father's Day around the corner.  But the guy was way too trusting.  Apparently so.  He trusted everybody.  Yeah.  Everyone.  We had a guy that claimed he was like a vet, and he never fought in any wars. 
[01:32:00]  He met with animals.  Yes, he was a veterinarian.  One after another.  I should have my brothers call up.  The stories are endless.  Endless.  The colored woman.  What?  I say the colored woman because of the famous story with my grandma going to my mom, hey,  the colored woman needs to talk to me.  Oh, right.  In grandma vernacular.  Yes.  Because she didn't know any better.  Of course.  That's just how they called those people when they were growing up.  That's how they talked back then.  But the final one where this was the end of tenants because they were slowly, slowly leaving 
[01:32:30]  and we couldn't replace them.  The final one left a fun suicide note in, yeah, it was the room I was brought up in.  Oh, nice.  This was my childhood room.  For real.  Wrecked your room.  This was my room, okay, where I grew up, where I jerked off for the first time, dreamt  about girls.  All those happy memories.  Right.  The fucking baseball pennants on the walls.  Aw. 
[01:33:00]  He left a suicide note.  And what he did was, should I name the train area?  Long Island Railroad?  Yeah, let's, no, I was going to actually get very specific.  Maybe I shouldn't.  Uh, yeah, left a suicide note that he was done.  And it was a horrific, uh, train hitting car.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  He parked his fucking car on the, on the train track at the railroad crossing. 
[01:33:30]  And just waited, huh?  Done.  And he also left a note in the car just in case there was enough of the car left.  And then, then, you know, the detective show up at mommy and daddy's house.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Went into his room and there was the suicide note.  Choo, choo.  And that's it.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck writing a book about radio.  Got to write a book about my life.  Oh, yeah.  You got any stories like that?  I've had my share of fun stories.  Oh, you got the, actually yours trumps mine.  Yeah, gunshots and.  The gunshot trumps mine and the. 
[01:34:00]  It did.  And the.  What, Mexican trying to get me into the woods?  No, do the other one.  The, uh, the, uh, what happened to the house you used to live in?  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  Used to live in, uh, I used to live in East Northport.  For real?  I picked it for real.  Yeah.  Yeah, and a nice house and I have many happy memories there.  It was, uh, me and my brother's sister and mommy and she always took care of us very well. 
[01:34:30]  Christmases were in there.  Just wonderful.  Wonderful time.  Very innocent time of life.  And, uh, we finally had to leave because the stupid landlord raised the rent above mommy's means.  So we had to move.  And, uh, we did.  And a family moved in, uh, into the house.  Lovely family.  Did you meet the family that replaced, uh, you guys in the house?  I saw the family, didn't meet the family.  Saw them moving boxes in kind of thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh.  Cute little kids?  Oh, yeah.  There was a son and daughter. 
[01:35:00]  Nice.  Um, I guess about, um, elementary, junior high school age.  Nice.  Around there.  Uh, very cute.  Adorable kids.  And, um, then, uh, I open up the newspaper and I see my house.  Nice.  One day.  Good.  I'm like, what's going on?  What, house for sale or something?  The new, the new family that moved in there, uh, you know, there must have been, uh, some  kind of thing.  Like, the father won the Nobel Peace Prize.  Are they celebrities?  Celebrities.  How long after you guys left the house? 
[01:35:30]  Eh, I don't know.  Probably about a month, maybe.  It was a month later?  Oh, yeah.  It was very, very quick.  I didn't know that part of the story.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was very fast.  So, so the house was very fresh in your memory still.  Of course it was.  Still wishing you could live there.  Uh, yeah.  I always had a dream of maybe going back someday.  Right up until I read the story of how, um, how, uh, dad came home.  I guess he must have had a bad day at the office or something.  It happens.  Spaghetti on the wall type thing. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  He came home and, uh, like every day, I guess the kids, uh, greeted him at the door.  Nice.  When daddy, uh, uh, came to the door.  Hi, daddy.  And daddy went, hi, kids.  And drilled two bullets into their heads and left them dying on the linoleum floor that  we all put in.  Me, my sister, my brother, and mom.  Because we used to do a lot of house projects and stuff.  Like, hey, kids, we're putting in new linoleum in the, uh, foyer.  Or we're gonna, uh, uh, put, uh, carpeting in here. 
[01:36:30]  Or we're painting the walls.  And we'd all get together and have family moments of fixing the house up.  And, uh, oh, the walls that we painted just blood splattered.  Two dead kids.  Holy crap.  And then, uh, the dad decided, uh, wow, look what I did.  And went into the kitchen and just blew his brains out.  You know, the kitchen where I sat and ate and colored Easter eggs on the table as a young  lad.  Uh, yeah.  Just fun times.  Good times.  What about the mother?  Uh, I guess she was gone. 
[01:37:00]  Um, you know, I guess she could be none too happy about what happened.  Wow.  Were they divorced or was she just...  I think they were divorced.  So that mom is still around somewhere, probably.  Maybe.  Ugh.  Maybe.  Did we ever try to find the, uh, news story?  I don't know.  It was, um, 2 Barry Place.  B-A-R-R-E is the way the street was...  So someone lives there now.  I know.  Google an aunt's old house.  Let's Google a murder house.  B-A-R-R-E Place, uh, east-north corridor.  Double murder-suicide. 
[01:37:30]  Let's see if something comes up.  Unfortunately, the internet wasn't happening, so it might be tough to find this old article.  I know.  And it was on the news, too.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, it was a pretty big story.  Was it on...  When daddy kills two kids, uh, in a house.  In your old house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, why does that address keep coming up?  What?  What do you mean?  What is it?  Some kind of zoning thing?  Yeah, it's kind of... 
[01:38:00]  There's some zone.  Oh, it's the whole thing.  Because the friggin' landlord used to run his, uh, air conditioning business out of the...  Oh, wow.  Out of the garage in the back.  What an ironic twist of fate that was, too.  I grew up in a house with this landlord that used to make all kinds of noise, uh, in the  back, because he had this giant two-car garage full of air conditioning equipment and stuff,  because he ran an air conditioning company.  Right.  And, uh...  And I hated it.  There was always stuff laying around, metal and stuff, and the workers were all a bunch 
[01:38:30]  of douchebags.  And, uh...  Then I became one.  And I had to do it for a living.  Ugh.  That sucks.  Yeah.  I was one of those assholes.  You're a good boy.  I tried.  All right, we're going to try to find that.  That is...  You're a sweet boy.  That's a horrific story.  Oh, it was terrible.  I always...  Ruined the whole image of the house and everything.  I always wonder, like, what happened in, you know, the house we grew up in. 
[01:39:00]  Dead, dead.  Before us.  Because they don't tell you that stuff.  They're not allowed to tell you that stuff.  No, I guess not.  I told you, uh, when I first started looking for a place in Manhattan, I told that story  too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Where...  I saw a beautiful brownstone, and, uh...  As soon as we went in there to look around, like, everyone was really nervous.  And I'm like, oh, I guess...  I guess this is how it is.  Nervous, huh?  Because it was pretty much the first house we looked at.  I'm like, I guess this is how it is to look for a house.  You know, people are nervous because they want to sell or whatever. 
[01:39:30]  And I remember the mom was a foot away from us the entire time, moving into rooms before  us and quickly making sure the room was just right.  Oh, oops, this is not right.  And just quickly fixing something.  And as soon as we left the brownstone, I go to our realtor, and they're not allowed  to say anything.  I go, look, what the fuck is going on?  I just had a weird, like, something wasn't right.  She's like, eh, well, let's just put it this way. 
[01:40:00]  They really, really want to sell the house badly, or the brownstone really badly.  Why?  I just kept at him.  Yeah, yeah.  At him.  At him.  Well, their son, their 17-year-old son killed themselves about a year ago.  And the memories are just haunting them.  So now I want to go back in.  Because now I'm trying to figure out where did the son kill himself in this house?  Because we saw...  Ty Huntington.  We saw every inch of this brownstone, obviously.  Yeah.  Because they're showing us everything. 
[01:40:30]  I'm like, where the fuck did they find the body?  That's all I was thinking.  On to the next appointment.  I'm like, where did it happen?  And they were from France, I guess.  And they had, like, this brownstone in New York.  And all they wanted was to be out of New York and back in France.  And they wanted us to buy it.  How many people buy houses where horrific shit happened that you don't even know about?  I'm sure.  Because I think there really is a law.  You're not allowed to, you know, talk about that stuff if you're a realtor. 
[01:41:00]  But this one, I insisted on it.  And she finally said, all right, all right.  79, 80.  You might find Anthony's thing?  I'll see.  He might.  Danny's the pro.  But this is a tough one.  This is a tough one.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was...  I think it was considered Huntington, to tell you the truth.  But, wow, yeah.  It ruined every bit of my childhood as far as that house goes. 
[01:41:30]  I drove past it a few times.  And I can't even look at it and go, oh, I remember, you know, playing out in the yard.  Yeah, that's bad.  It's I remember.  Ah!  Did I ever tell you about the other apartment we were looking at?  I mean, trying to find an apartment in New York, even if you don't have the money, just do it.  Because the experience is amazing.  We were in another one where it was so obvious it was an old guy's apartment or an old woman's apartment.  Because the building was beautiful.  And this apartment was horrendous.  The wallpaper was falling off the walls. 
[01:42:00]  The windows were so dirty.  I mean, I'm going to exaggerate a little bit.  But you had a tough time looking out these windows.  And there was a lagoon hotel.  Yeah, there was like a musky.  Musky or musky.  Musty, either way.  Musty smell.  Musky would be if a man was there spreading his ass cheeks.  And then there was like personal stuff from one person still there.  And it was so obvious that it was an old dude or old broad that died. 
[01:42:30]  And the apartment's been sitting there ever since.  Yeah, probably found it after a month.  To the point where the wallpaper was falling off the walls.  Yeah, well, somebody here is saying like, oh, someone's house was built in like 1890.  And you got to know, there's probably been a boatload of people in there.  Right.  Just drop dead.  Yeah, I mean, dropping dead, that happens.  But I'm talking about the horrific stuff where it's a murder.  You know what I mean?  It's just some horrific thing. 
[01:43:00]  How about like fucking pedos?  You're in a house where a pedo was doing his work.  Oh, I'm sure there's – you know, I would love to know, has anybody ever been looking  at something – now, see, there's no way to do that without being a creep.  I'm thinking, has anybody ever been watching like some kind of an awful video, like child  porn or something like that, and seen their old place on it, but then if you're watching  child porn, you're a fuck-up anyway?  You know what I mean?  There's no way to do that without being a piece of shit.  Right.  Piece of shit.  Remember the comic equation we were doing? 
[01:43:30]  Yes, of course.  Here's another one I've thought of.  New York City.  How many people in New York City, Jimmy?  I think – Danny might want to check it, but 8 million was the last – but it could  be 9 million now.  Let's call it – let's call it 8.5 million people in New York City, right?  Does that count all the boroughs?  Yes.  Okay, all the boroughs.  Let's just go with that.  How many people right now are dead in their apartments and no one knows?  Holy shit. 
[01:44:00]  That's another one I think of.  That's pretty creepy.  You do always hear about that.  There's at least one, right?  There's at least – at least, right?  Yeah, just sitting there.  How many do you think?  Watching TV.  You think there's maybe a dozen or two dozen people that are actually dead in their apartments  right now and no one knows?  Maybe not that many.  There's a lot of old people.  Yeah, that's true.  That the family gave up on.  Oh, no.  They couldn't be bothered anymore.  Just kind of sitting there with that dumb look on their face.  Just waiting to be found.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Possibly an odor.  But if it's a rat-infested apartment, then the person could be eaten and then never found.  You know, we smelled something, but we never gave it a second thought.  Really?  Really?  How do you smell like dead person?  Dead animal.  We were going to go to this bodega story, but you're –  Your death story and my suicide story got the phones ringing in.  Let's say hi to Rich in Buffalo.  Rich.  Hey, I just moved up here a couple years ago from Downstate, and we found out like a year 
[01:45:00]  later after we bought this great house that the gentleman who lived there off themselves  and kind of was found by one of the family members.  And one of our neighbors kind of knew this but didn't want to tell us this for like the  year that we lived there.  And, you know, it's not something that you would know, especially coming from a completely  different area that you would know or someone would even tell you, and you kind of find  out.  And then, of course, I'm on the internet trying to find out all the information on it. 
[01:45:30]  And, you know, I was very sketchy.  I couldn't find out too much.  But it just now gives us like an odd feeling, you know, living there.  Yeah.  If there's someone in real estate out there, I mean, I really believe you're not allowed  to talk about that stuff.  But I think we need to know.  I don't want to live in a house where someone killed themselves.  Yeah.  I don't even want to live in a house where like a 95-year-old grandma died in her bed.  Yeah, that happens a lot, though. 
[01:46:00]  That – yeah.  I mean, maybe you can't get around that one.  But the murder thing, I think we need to know that shit.  We kind of knew that the guy like was sick and everything and that he may have died in  the house, but we didn't know how, you know, and we certainly didn't know.  Right.  It may have been self-inflicted.  Wow.  There you go.  See?  Watch it out.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Biff in Texas.  Biff.  Hey, gentlemen, I got a quick anecdote for you to broaden your morning.  I was interning one summer in a shit town in West Texas and sitting by the pool, July 
[01:46:30]  4th, and the cops were pretty heavy in the apartment complex, and they came out and told  the lady something had happened in her apartment.  And I thought I heard the officer say that he killed your cats, and I got a kick out of  it and sort of laughed and kept drinking beer by the pool.  And as more officers came in, they saw him taking little body bags out of the house. 
[01:47:00]  It felt like total shit, you know, after laughing at the lady for her kids that just got killed  with a shotgun, you know?  Her kids got shot, not her kittens.  It's not.  Holy.  Is this the truth?  Now, don't con me, Biff.  100% true.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to try to move through these phones, because now we're on a horrific topic.  Yeah, I know.  A little sharing leads to a horrific topic.  Let's go to Sean in Michigan. 
[01:47:30]  Sean.  Yes.  Hi.  We bought this.  Me and my wife just got married, and we were looking for a cute little house.  And we bought this house from this old lady.  Wonderful lady.  Cookies and milk kind of old lady.  She just knit sweaters for you.  Well, after we bought the house and signed the deal, because it was a great little flat  apartment, a house, rather, we buy it from her, and somehow my wife was talking to her,  and she said, oh, by the way, not to scare you or anything, but my husband hung himself 
[01:48:00]  in the garage of the house we just bought.  All right.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  Thanks.  Goodbye.  Have a great day.  He already signed the deal, though.  He was stuck.  To this day, we still have the house.  We bought a new house and built one, and we still haven't sold the house.  So I don't know if people know about it or not, but nobody is looking at this house,  and we're stuck with it.  Do you look at the area in the garage where he hung himself and get all creeped out?  Yeah.  You go in there, it's real creepy, and you're like, these old rafters, and you're like, 
[01:48:30]  I wonder where this old fart killed himself.  Brooks was here as a scratched in the beam that he hung himself on.  And I wonder if you could have just left him there and used him as one of those things  when his sneakers hit the windshield, you're far enough in your garage to close the door.  Oh, dude.  That's perfect.  Thanks for the visuals.  That's great.  Nice.  Let's go to Don in Boston.  Hello, Don.  Hey, Bobo Boys.  Love the show. 
[01:49:00]  In Framingham, Massachusetts, you guys know where that is.  Of course.  He used to work in this area.  Yep.  Do you remember the story of only a couple years ago of the fellow who came home from  his office job, and his wife burned the ZD, and he impaled her.  Well, actually, he killed her, and then he stuck her organs on a stick in the middle of  the yard.  And do you remember that story?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Don.  I interrupted you.  Well, anyway, the story is that he killed his wife and basically took her organs, I don't 
[01:49:30]  know which ones, and impaled them on a stick.  The reason was she had burned the ZD, kind of a variation of your story, Anthony, spaghetti  on the wall.  But the fellow who bought the house after that, I understand, just died violently in  an accident overseas.  So, ooh, scary stuff.  Did it involve ZD?  I don't know if there was any pasta or any kind of wheat products involved, but it was  a scary one.  You guys are great.  Punch it out.  I could back up Don.  We were doing radio up there when that happened.  It was one of the most horrific stories ever. 
[01:50:00]  Ever.  He just put the organs on the front lawn on stakes for everyone to see.  And people were like, what the fuck?  Tom in Denver.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  I live in the house that my brother killed himself in a year and a half ago.  I don't know.  And you're...  How do you deal with that?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, your bottom line is I inherited the mortgage.  I might as well live in the damn thing.  Yeah.  Did you just...  Did you lock the room or something?  I would never use that room again. 
[01:50:30]  No.  I mean, I sleep in the room.  It's a master bedroom.  And, you know, it's a brand new house.  And they get...  Well, you know, you make lemons, you might as well make lemonade.  That's true.  But how about when the lemons are splattered all over the wall?  Well...  But speaking of that, the John Bonet Ramsey house just went up for sale here in Boulder,  Colorado.  Wow.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  They want 2.5 million for it.  And they seem to be very confident they're going to get it. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Good luck to them.  Little cowboy hat included?  I hope so.  I want to go get it.  Ugh.  The Greek broad is back.  Oh, what is that?  My...  My life in ruins.  The Greek broad is back.  My big fat Greek wedding?  Yeah.  The star woman?  Yeah.  Her.  She's doing a new movie.  And they're trying to gussy her up.  She is ugly.  Yeah.  Fuck her.  That's an ugly woman.  I care.  Let's say hi to Ernest the Trucker.  Ernest.  Hey, Uncle.  Hey, Ant.  Hey. 
[01:51:30]  Jimmy.  Hi, man.  Good morning.  Sorry.  I was with my best friend and his boss.  They were in the Air Force, and we were at the bar drinking and everything.  And he pretty much relayed a story about how we were searching for a home, and they found  a nice little house.  And, you know, everything was fine.  And then you, the family, and everything like that.  And they were getting ready to close on it.  The day before they closed, something happened, and he came home. 
[01:52:00]  The guy came home and shot his wife and two kids.  Yeah.  The day before they closed?  They were getting ready to close on the house.  And something had happened, and he just went ballistic and decided to shoot up his family.  That's not kind of, that's not as creepy as, you know, buying a house and living in a house.  You kind of got off topic there.  Really?  I've got to be honest with you.  You kind of got a little off topic there.  Yes, sir.  You're killing a fun vibe here. 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  A great fun vibe.  We're having a few laughs, and you're bringing the lofts and lofts.  Do we have Brooke Hogan coming in today?  830.  830.  Oh.  Tom from Worcester.  Tom.  How's it going?  Welcome aboard, Tommy.  Yeah, guys, I'm a realtor in Worcester up here, and in Massachusetts, it's different  in some states, but up here, it's called a stigmatized property if someone kills himself  or, you know, whatever, and you've got to tell them only if they ask. 
[01:53:00]  If they don't ask, you don't have to tell.  So that's the deal up there.  You're being gay in the Army.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, here's the deal.  Whoever's buying a house, ask.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Who died in this fucking thing?  I don't want to be haunted at night while I'm trying to go to bed.  Thank you, sir.  Why would the ghost...  What happened?  When Danny did something came out of his ass, I don't mind the sound, but it was wet.  It actually sounded like spoiled meat. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, always ask.  Yours don't exactly sound like an orchestra.  And you farted.  He was disgusted with my sounds.  Yeah.  Well, there's a million stories.  Should we move on?  In the naked city.  Yeah, yeah.  I think we're done with the dead people in the apartment house stories.  My dad killed himself when I was two, and I lived in the house until I moved out.  That's Akiva.  I was two and a half.  Three months ago, my girlfriend killed herself in a hotel room, and I want to go and stay there. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  That's sick.  He wants to be where she was for last night.  Is that guy on the phone?  Yeah, Joe.  Why?  Why do you want to go where your girlfriend killed herself?  Well, I believe in the paranormal, but she was a firm believer in that shit, and I don't  know.  Then she'd come see you.  What's that?  Then wouldn't she come see you?  You can't just travel as a ghost.  No, I'm not trying to find her.  You can only travel within the area you died in. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, everyone knows that.  I just have this urge to stay in the room.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  How long did you date her for?  How long did you date her for?  How long did I date her for?  Yeah.  Two years, but I've known her for 20.  But I just wanted to say that I turned her on to Jimmy and me and her sat in the front  row in Allentown at the show, and she loved you.  She thought you were great.  Thank you.  So she made her laugh.  But I also wanted to ask Ted what he thought about maybe her coming back as a ghost. 
[01:55:00]  I don't know the girl.  Why did she do it?  What?  Why did she do it?  I can't speculate until I know.  Why was the poor girl depressed?  Oh, she had all kinds of feelings.  Oh, I've heard.  I can't wait.  What?  Can you say that again?  I'm Ted the Grief Counselor.  Ted the Grief Counselor.  Yeah.  What happened to the poor dear?  What happened?  Oh, yes.  What was making her so sad?  I don't know.  I have no clue. 
[01:55:30]  Well, you obviously had very good communication in the relationship.  No, no.  That was good.  It was just one of those things that she was born with.  She was born with what, sir?  Disorders, I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know what to do with this one, sir.  I only counsel grief, but you're not giving me much.  When I was a boy, I had a lot of grief.  You did, Ted?  My grandmother hung herself in front of me.  Did that affect you?  Yes, it did.  I can only come now when looking at old lady's feet dangling. 
[01:56:00]  Well, it seems like you're not coming a lot then there, Ted.  All right.  Good luck to you, sir.  Wow.  All right.  Taking a serious fucking story and trying to get Ted to chime in.  And he, yeah, he brings it up.  He wants to stay in the room.  Oh, my God.  I was ready to move on.  You got it.  This is a good one.  John on Long Island, because we can all relate to part of this story.  John, go ahead.  Yo, I grew up in Hicksville, and we used to ride our bikes across this old guy's lawn. 
[01:56:30]  He'd come out and yell at us, saying he was going to kill us if we kept doing it.  As it turns out, he would get hookers at night and then kill them.  I think it was something like 12 hookers dead.  Whoa.  That's a good one.  Punching out?  What do you mean, punching out?  Which serial killer?  Yeah.  Come on.  We've had a few on Long Island.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Joel Rifkin.  Was it Joel?  Good old Joel Rifkin.  It's hard not to go to these phones, but I guess we did it, right? 
[01:57:00]  I got to tinkle.  Yeah, we'll tinkle.  Brooke Hogan's coming in.  The Bodega story with the guy and the gun and the robber.  It's a pretty good story.  We could go backstage with O&A with Joe Frazier.  Want to hear that?  Oh, yeah.  I do.  Frazier was great yesterday.  Yeah, he was very nice.  He was great.  That gut punch thing, man.  I laughed about that all night.  That was such a great fucking thing when he would fake the gut punch.  You made that sound.  You actually went like, oh!  I was convinced he hit me. 
[01:57:30]  I was just waiting for the excruciating pain.  Thank God it never came.  Yeah, and then we snapped the photo immediately after.  That's the whacked out smile I got on my Twitter.  Just completely whacked out.  But here is Backstage with O&A with Joe Frazier.  And now, Backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And after Smoke and Joe Frazier stopped by the O&A show, we were able to bombard him in 
[01:58:00]  the hallway as he was trying to make his way to the restroom.  We're going towards the bathroom.  I'll walk with you.  I'm not into the bathroom.  Oh.  Just on the way.  What are we going to talk about?  Opie and Anthony.  I work for the show you just did, Opie and Anthony.  How did it go in there?  I'm fine, man.  The guy's a lot of fun.  After Mr. Frazier realized we weren't just some random stranger with a microphone, we  got to talking about his career.  Were you surprised that they wanted you to sing so much?  No, no, no.  I love the music. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  And I can't sing because I came from a singing family.  Let's say 17 brothers and sisters.  And we all went to church and we'll go to church on Sunday.  Do you think you're...  All my daddy.  What do you think you're better at, singing or fighting?  Come again?  Singing or fighting, what are you better at?  I like both of them.  You could be the best of both, right?  The best of both.  And where I go, I get paid to sing.  At least hold the mic.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it. 
[01:59:00]  Boogie, boogie, boogie.  Boogie, boogie, boogie, indeed.  Whatever you say, Smokin' Joe, as long as you're an earshot, I say you can do it all.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Kind of embarrassing.  Brooke Hogan is in studio and she watched us checking out a girdle commercial.  Yeah, that's a girdle commercial.  Sorry about that, Brooke.  Yeah, it looks like it works, though. 
[01:59:30]  No, that's what we're saying.  I mean, they're using the wrong girls to make it look like it works.  Most fat pigs, nothing's going to work.  They're showing two different bodies.  They're showing one mess, and then they're showing an attractive one in the girdle,  and then they're making it look like it's the same person.  Yeah, exactly.  It's the same person.  You smell really good, by the way.  Yeah, the studio finally smells good.  What are you wearing?  It's juicy.  Oh, that is fantastic.  Yeah, juicy couture.  I smell a little vanilla in there.  Yeah, it's really sexy.  You can smell it all the way over there? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, are you kidding me?  Believe me, our sense of smell is very acute in this place.  When a woman walks in, it's pounce time.  Usually it's Jimmy's farts.  Yeah, it's usually a guesser.  Horrible.  That is not good.  You just smell like a girl, though.  That's such a nice smell, a girl smell.  Wow, what an original idea to have, Jim.  Yeah, well, girls smell good.  I yell that a lot of times as I'm chasing the mood.  Smell like a girl.  Smell like a girl.  That was a compliment.  Thank God.  So, Brooke, you're promoting your show, Brooke Knows Best Season 2.  I haven't even seen Season 1. 
[02:00:30]  I have kind of tuned out of reality.  How is it different from the Hogan?  Why haven't you seen it?  Why are you asking me questions on it if you haven't seen it?  Yeah.  Well, because I'm asking kind of for the audience, because obviously the people in the audience  have probably watched it.  The Hogan family was quite popular.  I'll start by saying this.  We had the whole family at our Halloween party.  Do you remember?  Probably not, because you do a lot of things, and I understand that.  Oh, I thought you were asking me.  We brought you on stage.  Everybody was getting along, and next thing you know, all hell broke loose. 
[02:01:00]  I'm like, what the hell?  This looked like a happy family.  Yeah.  Guess not.  Keeping up the front.  But for real, remember the Halloween party?  They all came out.  They all came out on stage.  It was great.  And you were teasing the audience.  They wanted to see something, something, and you almost showed them something, something.  I think I remember.  Then you kind of...  Was that the hard rock, I guess?  Yeah.  Used to be the WWF...  But it was pop.  Maybe, yeah.  It was your brother.  It was your mom.  I got...  Actually, the picture is in my house, and you're all happy. 
[02:01:30]  We're all, like, posing.  Yeah.  And then you fast forward a little bit, and everyone seems to hate each other.  I know.  Right?  Yeah.  For real.  I'm not trying to, like, you know...  And it plays out.  How do you feel that, like, that just plays out in the...  In the media, and on reality television like that?  Like, how do you feel personally about that?  It's kind of bummed me out.  I...  It does bum me out, just because I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to have to talk about the stuff with my mom.  Yeah.  You know, and I could be, you know, a total proof and be like, we're not talking about 
[02:02:00]  that on this interview.  But it's like, you know what?  So many people are going through the same thing that I'm going through, that I'm like,  if I don't talk about it, maybe, you know...  Yeah.  I'm thinking maybe it'll help somebody else in my situation, you know?  It's also played out, like I said, like, in public so much, it's like, ah, everybody  kind of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's hard not to talk about it, because you're doing your show where you're obviously,  you know, living by yourself now in Miami again.  Right.  Yeah.  So she's doing the...  So, and then she's on the phone with her father, and it's very obvious that you're not  getting along with your mother right now, so, you know, it's hard to ignore it. 
[02:02:30]  She's on the show, but not in the same room with me, so...  Right.  Why is she trying to explain her side of the story?  Yeah.  What is she saying?  Yeah.  I don't know why Brooke treats me this way, but I'm like, oh my gosh, do we really have to  get into who's right and who's wrong, and, you know?  I'm so confused, because when I watched The Hogan Family, you guys seem like a solid family.  Like, there's a lot of love.  Yeah, but it just kind of...  We were just under the pressure cooker, and I think that there were problems before, and  I think that everybody's true colors actually came out. 
[02:03:00]  Really?  You know what I mean?  Wow.  Even I was surprised, you know, especially with the stuff with my mom, so, you know, that's...  Do you think they'd still be together, and you guys would be together if it wasn't  for the original show?  No.  No.  Oh, really?  No.  It was just a matter of thought?  I think that they had problems anyway, so...  And I think that they were two different people, and they grew apart a long time ago, so I  think that just having that...  I don't think a camera crew can cause you to have a divorce, but I think having the people  just there all the time when you want to air out your shorts, or have an argument, or 
[02:03:30]  talk about something, you really can't, you know?  Just because it's like, if I was just going to go talk about all of my personal stuff  just in front of you guys just sitting here, like, with...  Well, I kind of am, but, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Your mom, I think, came out and said that your dad was fooling around, and I guess people  say that when there's going to be a divorce, because it's a smart thing to say, and he's  Hulk Hogan.  How do you not if you're Hulk Hogan?  Is that...  Do you believe that, or do you think she's just kind of slinging mud to get what she  has?  I think that it takes two to tango. 
[02:04:00]  I don't think either one of them were perfect.  I mean, obviously not.  But what I'm looking at right now is who is coming forth and being a good parent and being  a good person.  And that's Pops right now?  Yeah.  I mean, he's just...  He's being totally accountable.  He's like, Brooke, I did this, I did this, I did this.  You know?  But I love you, and saving my relationship with you is more important than anything.  Right.  You know?  So I want you to know who I am.  This is who I am, and hopefully you'll accept me.  You know, with my flaws and everything.  And, you know, we could go forward from there, but... 
[02:04:30]  What about your brother?  My brother is staying neutral.  He's out in L.A.  He's trying to just, you know, stay away from all the people in Tampa because he was just  getting ridiculed, you know?  Right, right, right.  He's working on a couple charities.  He's working on the John and John Foundation for his friend John.  He's in the hospital.  And it supports, like, brain stem cell research and stuff like that.  So I'm really proud of him.  He's just kind of staying out of the limelight.  Damn, look at Brooke being honest.  I mean, I didn't expect you to open up like this.  I like this.  It's going to help the reality show, too. 
[02:05:00]  I'm telling you.  Yeah, because reality shows a lot of times will show one side of it, but it's like,  hey, look, things go wrong.  I mean, you've got to show the negative and the...  Because people do relate to it.  I mean, there are a lot of families that have it.  The thing is, too, is that on the reality show, you have 23 minutes to, you know, explain  a story and make people laugh and whatever.  And they take, you know, certain funny things from what we do that day or whatever, and they  put it together.  But, you know, there's an actual side of me that has a brain or that has an opinion  or, you know, that wants to talk about real stuff or whatever. 
[02:05:30]  And this is kind of, you know, the extended reality version.  Right, yeah.  And it's Hogan knows best.  I know that.  I said Hogan family, whatever.  But what about the OJ comment that Hulk came out with?  It's so funny because everybody's asking me about that.  That's a pretty crazy...  If you just read the whole quote, it's like, I could have pulled an OJ, I could have done  this, but instead I chose to be a Christian and take the high road because, honestly, the  things that my dad's had to go through are maddening.  Right.  I know I would have snapped by now. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  You know?  And it's been embarrassing and it's been disrespectful, things that have happened to him.  So, you know, he's just saying, dude, I understand how you could snap, but when you're a good  person, you don't do that.  There was a but, you know, which they ignored and I think most people did understand exactly  what Hulk was saying.  Yeah.  You know, he can't be in the house that he, you know, he pretty much bought.  Yeah.  I mean, 19-year-old kids live in his house, using his closet, using his shower, his jets,  his boats, his money.  Of course you'd freak out.  You feel bad for him? 
[02:06:30]  It's embarrassing publicly to have people see that.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing and he's held his head high and I'm just proud of him.  He was mild-mannered in what he did compared to how absolutely enraged I would be in that  situation.  Yeah.  You buy a house, you buy everything, everything, and there's some kid living in your house  and driving your shit and everything.  I don't know how you live with that.  I'd go...  I don't know how you live with that.  Well, is she going to stay in the house or you don't know yet?  Because you're both, you and your brother are both of the age, so it's not like...  Yeah, no, there's no like child custody thing going on. 
[02:07:00]  I don't really know what's going to happen.  I know she wants a lot.  Wow, yeah.  You know what's weird about your mom, and I'm not trying to trash anyone, I promise,  but it seemed like she really enjoys the spotlight, which is weird because she was Hulk's wife  for all those years.  It's funny because I would love to, and for a long time, I would love to, like, I have  and I would still love to defend her.  She's my mother.  I will always respect her.  I'm never going to trash her, but people aren't too far off about what's going on, 
[02:07:30]  you know?  So it's like, you know...  But where did that come from?  I would normally not even comment, but she basically disowned me with the last quote  that she released with her publicist, Gary Smith, so it's kind of like...  About the boyfriend put out an album or something?  Yeah, just everything like that.  I'm like, that's my mother.  She basically said the boyfriend could put out an album that would be better than Brooke.  Well, Brooke, what was the exact...  Just so people don't take it out of context.  She said that Charlie would be able to put out an album and it would sell more copies than  mine and that I've always had a problem with lying simply because I haven't wanted to talk 
[02:08:00]  about my breasts.  Well, I don't talk about my gynecology appointments either.  Like, it's a personal choice.  You feel free, though.  Yes, you're more this far.  You can sing about them here if you'd like.  And that I'm dating like a pothead and I'm banging the hell out of them and, you know,  just painting me to be such a raunchy, nasty person when I've been such a good kid and  such a good daughter and just...  I've taken so much crap, like, my whole life that I'm like, wow, that's the things I get?  Damn, what's the motivation behind that?  Just to, like, piss you off, I guess? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Well...  What'd you say?  She likes the spotlight.  She likes the spotlight.  Oh, okay.  Which, it was so obvious that when Hogan Knows Best was happening, you could just see it  developing on screen because, I mean, a lot of us know Hulk from wrestling.  All those years, we never knew that his wife...  None of us saw her for the most part.  It's funny because it kind of goes back, even though the words don't describe it perfectly,  but remember how people are always like, you know, if you have something, you don't need  to talk about it kind of thing? 
[02:09:00]  It's that same thing.  It's kind of like, my dad and I, we don't need to parade around and make a big deal of  ourselves and stuff.  Yeah, sure, you know, we have to promote our, you know, work and stuff that we're doing  just because that's our job and it comes with it, but I'm not trying to ride on any more  than I need to, you know what I mean?  Right.  And it's just kind of like when you're trying to get what the wrestlers call like cheap heat  all the time.  It's just like, it's just like, you're just trying to scratch at anything to get noticed  and it's just like, stop, like, because it's ruining the family. 
[02:09:30]  All of a sudden she's on the red carpet with her young lover that she probably doesn't even  love.  I mean, that's just a thing, obviously, you know.  Yep.  It's a way to kind of rub it.  There's nothing that a guy wants to see less than your wife with somebody.  A woman doesn't want to see what your husband with a younger woman either.  It's just a way to rub it in somebody's face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  When you're angry.  Yeah.  What did you, uh, did you get a big laugh out of that whole thing with, um, with, uh,  hulk, uh, uh, rubbing your bottom?  Oh yeah.  I thought that was so funny.  I was just like, people will really do anything. 
[02:10:00]  Like, oh my God.  I, I like, I hug my dad and I kiss him on the cheek and I'll like grab his cheeks and like  get close to him and stuff.  He's my dad.  Like, I love him.  He's my blood.  It's, and you know, he'll grab your cheeks.  Yeah.  He grabs my cheeks all the time.  No, it's so funny.  Cause like he used to change my diapers and it's not like he's like, I'm spreading go wide.  It's like, I'm laying there and I'm lazy and I'm like, I don't want to get up dad.  Will you just put some suntan lotion on my back and stuff? 
[02:10:30]  And he like rubbed it on the back of my legs and on my calves and stuff.  And it's like, we grew up in a family that tanned and worked out and it's like, it's not  even a big deal.  And the media makes a big deal cause they catch the photo.  Like when you see somebody with a camera, you look, but whenever you look at a camera,  it looks like you've been caught doing something wrong.  If me and my dad were making out or something, I'd be like, all right, there's something freaky  about that.  But it's like, it's my dad.  I mean, come on.  Smart people understand that.  But man, they blew that one out of proportion.  It was funny though.  It's just something to, for them to just, you know, I don't think.  Did you guys talk about it and like, do you guys laugh and laugh? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  I remember we saw it and I said, dad, look at this.  And he started chuckling.  He was like, he found it to be the funniest thing in the world.  And it's funny when my dad chuckles.  Because I always wonder, I always wonder that, like, you know, cause we see, we see the  one side that, the, the people that reported on these, you know, access fucking Hollywood  shit and stuff like that.  And, and, and how people react to it.  Like, oh my God, did you see, but I love to find out like what happened behind the scenes  where people just, like you guys probably just laugh and go, oh yeah.  Like it was so funny.  I was on Howard and we were talking about the whole thing with my mom saying Brooks lied 
[02:11:30]  about her boobs.  So I've never lied about my boobs.  I've just been like, I'm not talking about it.  Well, I was like, fine.  If everybody wants to know, they're fake.  Like I had a good set before, but I chose to have them enhanced.  Sometimes I wish I didn't do it, whatever.  Like it's just, how young, oh my God, fall back over and freak out now because now everybody  knows.  Now what do we do?  Yeah.  How young were you?  Um, I was, it was actually last year.  I was like 20, 20.  What's wrong with that?  A lot of women get them done.  Did you go much larger?  Did you just want to even them out?  I actually had a C and I'm, um, I'm like a, a big C now. 
[02:12:00]  Like I'm like close to a D, but they still look real.  Yeah.  I had, I had a lot of breast tissue and I had, I just didn't like the natural breast tissue  for a while.  I like, I just, I didn't like the natural look.  They were pretty, but they were just, I was like, you know what?  I just want to have them be like a little bit more round.  I did it more for the shape than for anything else, you know, not for size or anything.  Yeah.  Cause I had boobs.  Like I could push them up and make them look big.  So people were telling me that I had breast implants before I even got them. 
[02:12:30]  So it was like, all right, well, whatever.  This is the greatest conversation ever.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it certainly doesn't stop.  The shape in it.  And she's wearing a fantastic, I don't know what you call it.  It looks like a long man's shirt.  It's like a, it's a really sexy.  Yeah.  It's like a little, I got it from BB, which by the way, they have not helped sponsor me  at all.  And all I do is wear their stuff.  Well, they better start.  I know, right?  I should probably start wearing Marciano.  Um, no.  Yeah.  This is from BB and I just, uh, I don't know.  I, I like how they're close to it.  So, so how does this, how does this end with your family? 
[02:13:00]  You think?  I don't know.  I hope that me and my mom can reconcile, even though right now I'm at the point where  I'm like, I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to, I don't know how I'm going  to ever be able to look at her the same and know what she did to me.  You know, like that's, you just don't throw your kids under the bus.  What if she claims insanity?  Like, I'm just out of my mind.  Then I would at least be like, thanks for being honest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, but right now you have nothing to build on because when somebody is not straightforward  about stuff, you kind of can't go anywhere with it.  Right.  And trying to get, uh, trying to get a lot of dad's cash, I guess is, uh, not a happy 
[02:13:30]  thing.  Yeah.  That's a turnoff too.  It just makes me like, cause isn't there enough money for everybody in the end?  There is, you know, and it's like everybody's struggling right now and, and it's just, we  don't understand.  We talk about why the greed, you know, there's so many people that don't have anything and  it's like, still you want more and more and more.  It's like, why not, you know, give it to a charity or something if you're going to do  something with it.  I never saw it taking any bumps in the ring to get that, uh, I, you know, I went through 
[02:14:00]  a very similar, uh, situation where, um, Hey, I didn't, someone else wasn't getting  up and, and getting on the, on the microphone and doing a radio show yet, uh, you know, I  paid through the nose.  Yeah.  We understand you don't throw someone out on the street, but it gets to a point where  it's ridiculous.  And we really believe the guys get screwed in these, the divorce cases.  See, that girl doesn't really need the girl.  No, she doesn't at all.  See, why is she putting it on?  See, that's the one we're trying.  She actually looks fatter without it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, why would she?  She doesn't need it. 
[02:14:30]  No.  And then she puts this thing on, this little, tiny little dress.  Like she needs that.  They're making, they're making this new, um, this new bra thing too, where like the front  is a bra, but the back is like a full tank top.  So you don't get that like fat roll thing in the back.  Oh, you don't get that.  But like, how do you wear that with anything?  That's horrendous.  That's like this big piece in the back.  And like, can you imagine your boyfriend takes off your shirt?  He's like, baby, what's that?  It's like a bra slash bulletproof vest.  Exactly.  You can probably feel it through a hug.  Yeah.  You know, like, oh, what the hell is this?  You know what?  It's weird.  Cause it doesn't just feel like soft skin. 
[02:15:00]  Like whenever anybody wears a girdle, I know that I've had to wear like, you know, Spanx  or whatever, like under Grammy dresses and stuff.  If they're silk and you don't want to see any painting like, and you really, it feels  like hard, like packed in.  It's weird.  It's weird.  It's like hugging Armadillo.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, you're doing a, this is, I'm an, I'm an Osborne freak.  And, uh, you know, I guess you're doing a, some indie movie with, uh, Kelly Osborne.  And I guess, you know, it says here, you really need to, you really need to research. 
[02:15:30]  No, no.  It says here, she is starring in the indie horror film Devour alongside Kelly Osborne.  Not even wrote up the prep sheet.  No.  Oh, someone's going to get beat up.  Let me tell you something.  Jimmy constantly has wrong information, but it's not given to him, but it's given to me  by our staff, who probably thinks research is looking at Wikipedia and copying and pasting.  But Jimmy, I crossed that one out.  I knew it wasn't true.  But I didn't know it wasn't true.  I was going to ask her if she was a good actress.  And now, whoever he asked, who wrote that, you, you will see like three or four people 
[02:16:00]  pass the buck to other people.  We've seen this before.  And we'll play it off in front of you like, it's not a big deal.  And then after you leave, we'll be the biggest douchebags until we, he'll be livid.  Yeah, we, me.  Then he got to look silly in front of you.  We got Brooke Hogan.  So you're not, you're not doing any films, are you?  No.  No, I didn't think you were.  I would, I would try acting, but yeah.  Let's push the show for her though.  Brooke Knows Best season two premieres this Sunday, 10 p.m. on VH1.  What are we going to see in general?  We're actually playing two episodes.  Yeah.  So everybody's going to get to see Double Whammy. 
[02:16:30]  But yeah, it's a, it's this Sunday at 10 o'clock and it's every Sunday at 10.  And, um, and my album's coming out.  Uh, when is that?  I was afraid to ask.  July 21st.  July 21st.  But you know, Charlie's is following shortly after and I'm very scared of the competition.  Well, I'm sure it's going to do better.  He really does?  Was it a joke that your mom said or he actually sings?  It was a joke.  Oh, okay.  What a dope I am.  I'm so paranoid about information now.  It says here he sings very well.  Yes.  It says here Charlie's a tenor.  What does, what does Charlie do well? 
[02:17:00]  Does he do anything well?  Sell jet skis.  But apparently he's like a fireman now, but I'm like, why is he still working on the  beach then?  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Oh, God.  How old is he?  20.  I think now.  I think he turned 20.  He was 19.  Did you really go to high school with him?  We went to grade school.  Grade school.  But I didn't know, know him.  Like I knew of him because he was in the grade below me.  I was like the badass eighth grader and he was the seventh grader.  Right.  Is he nice to you if he sees you or is he a dick or is he like, look, it's just the  situation.  I don't think he has a thought process that runs through his head. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  I found him hiding in my brother's bathroom when I first met him.  He was like hiding in the house.  What the fuck is he hiding?  Like I think my mom was like hiding him from me or something.  And I was like, I kind of got up in his face.  I was like, yo, are you my mom's boyfriend?  Get out of this house, you know?  Because it was like a new thing still and I was pissed.  Yeah, of course.  He was like, uh, uh, uh, yeah.  Like, uh, but I need to get my flip flops, dude.  I'm like, get the flip flops. 
[02:18:00]  Is pops doing okay though?  Yeah.  My dad is strong.  He is being so strong and just holding his head so high and I'm so proud of him.  I'm like, yeah, I really am.  I don't think anybody looks down on him though.  It's like people know how it is.  It's like, it's a public situation.  No one's looking at him.  People know he can go out and pick up a fucking 18 year old model if he wants to.  Like nobody thinks your dad is having a, it's, it just sucks.  Everybody thinks like, ah, that's kind of fucked up.  It's obviously the average person that she, I mean, God, I hate saying this in front of  her, but your mom's the problem.  She's really playing this up big time. 
[02:18:30]  I think, I think, and it's funny because in the quote they were like, oh, her ideas of  good fun is going to 830 mass and then enjoying her favorite Cuban snack.  I'm like, I've never known my mom to eat Cuban food.  I know she's not waking up for 830 mass.  And I'm like, if you are a Christian, why are you putting out releases throwing your daughter  under the bus?  Yeah.  You know?  So I'm like, what?  It just doesn't make sense.  So I mean.  Yeah.  Was she responding to a quote of yours when you, when you, when she said that?  Like, did you say something about her doing drugs?  No, no, no.  I've always, I've always been respectful. 
[02:19:00]  People will ask me, they're like, cause it's come up before in situations with my dad  and in court and whatever, and Bubba radio down in Tampa and stuff.  They've brought up the drug thing a lot, you know, and everybody says that they see her  doing it and whatever.  I've always been like, I've never physically seen her doing drugs.  Do I feel like she has something to come clean about?  Yes.  That's been my pat answer.  Right.  I've been very respectful.  And, and I did an interview with Perez Hilton and, and I said the same pat answer.  And, you know, anybody who, who writes an article or who has an interview or whatever will title 
[02:19:30]  it something to get people's attention.  And it said like, Brooke thinks mom is doing drugs, you know, but it's not something that  I physically said, but it was just the title of the interview.  So people would click on it and be like, Oh my God, really?  So she's obviously.  And, and, and she thought that I said that and, and I'm like, I didn't say that.  Yeah.  You know, I read the interview back.  It was like an okay magazine or something.  And, and, and then the president came out or whatever.  And she was like, I can't believe you'd say that.  But also she just slaughtered me.  I was like, wow, that's brutal. 
[02:20:00]  You think it's Coke though?  Jesus.  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  I've never done Coke.  I've never done drugs.  So I don't know how they make you act.  You know what I mean?  So I'm just kind of like, well, how's she acting?  And I'm sure we can help you out right here.  Well, she's fine.  She's just waking up and eating a sign of a drug addict.  Right.  Does she have the munchies?  Let's start there.  I don't know.  She's, she's actually lost weight.  Oh, well, all right.  Then we're talking, uh, you know.  Grinding teeth.  Yeah.  Does she grind teeth? 
[02:20:30]  All right.  How are you doing?  Does she battle a lot for hours?  But don't you grind your teeth when you sleep?  Some people just do that.  Yeah.  That's usually the sign of, usually if you're grinding your teeth when you're sleeping,  you're not doing Coke.  Yeah.  You're awake.  Right.  All the time.  Is there anybody, uh, anybody, uh, on the album of, of, cause you had, uh, you had somebody  on the first song who I have.  Liza Minnelli.  Elvis Presley.  No.  Yeah.  So the prep, she says, she sang with the Beatles in 1964. 
[02:21:00]  No, I actually, is that on there?  Seriously?  I was like, no, you gotta be kidding me.  I wasn't even born.  We gotta wrap up.  Brooke is, uh, all over the place today.  Very busy girl.  Brooke, I gotta say, I, I thought you would say no comment, no comment.  We appreciate the honesty.  Of course.  Because a lot of people come in with some stuff you really want to talk about and they're  like, ah, I'm not talking about that.  Oh, you just have to be real.  And the nice smell in the room.  Oh, thank God for that.  Can you spray some of that as you leave?  I didn't bring it with me, but I can, like, flip my hair and, like, kind of let it linger. 
[02:21:30]  Gotta let it aerate around the room.  It's, uh, Brooke.  Waft it.  Brooke Knows Best, season two in Miami.  Yep.  Do you get to keep that place?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's ours.  They gave that to you?  No, they didn't give it to us.  We're, we.  You bought it yourself?  We paid for it, yeah.  Oh, look at you.  God damn.  Uh, this Sunday, 10 p.m. on VH1, two episodes, and then, uh, July 21st, The Redemption.  Mm-hmm.  Are you a fan of Britney?  Yeah.  You are?  It's, it's like a guilty pleasure.  Yeah, like, I, I love her.  Have you done any oopsies or anything yet? 
[02:22:00]  No.  No.  And I, I always wear underwear, and.  But you know she's doing that on purpose, right?  That's the whole thing.  God, I, I would, I can understand doing a lot of things on purpose, but that's just embarrassing.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want people to see that, ever.  We came up with the term, the oopsie.  And you can't really practice that, where you know it's going to be a good shot.  Yeah, no.  Because you don't know what, yeah.  You have to just let it fly.  Yeah, you just gotta hope for the best.  The spread eagle and just hope that it ends up in proportion.  Hers didn't look good.  There were a couple of shots that were ran well. 
[02:22:30]  All right, we should get her out of here.  So, brookhoganmusic.com, too, if you want to check out, um, I don't know if your new  stuff's up there yet.  That's the wrong website, too?  Did they really give you the wrong website?  No.  Oh my God, I knew it right when you said it.  What's the, what's the pop website?  It's brooksworld.com.  Okay.  By the way, do not tune away.  I want to see Jimmy go ballistic on the staff, by the way.  Just so you know, just so you know it's there.  Right.  Because why would, why would we?  You should probably do your own research before you do your own interview. 
[02:23:00]  Well, you don't think to do that.  You don't.  Because if I was doing an interview on somebody, I would learn about them.  That's right.  I'm kidding.  I'm just teasing you.  But these are also little things, though.  It's like the website.  It's not like I said, you know, what was the name of your show?  It's like, this is just the website and a film that you could be working on.  There's no way, you have a research staff that does stuff like this.  You think they're going to look and check things out.  But why would they?  I can't wait to see somebody's head roll.  Rick, I just got to Twitter you, and then you can leave.  Move the microphone.  Move the microphone.  Twitter me.  If I'm going to Twitter you, you want a good one, right? 
[02:23:30]  Exactly, yep.  Of course.  Oh, you had to look down, as you said.  I didn't look down.  No, I got it.  So I understand that you and De Niro are doing a cop buddy movie.  Is that true?  She's looking over here.  Fucking mind-boggling.  Your people are very angry with us.  We've got to get you out.  But we promoted.  Don't be angry.  Thank you.  You did.  You really did.  She's not smiling.  And we're not happy.  Yes.  Smile, please.  Smile.  Oh, no, that's Rachel.  Rachel's cool.  She's my friend.  By the way, a lot of people are saying how hot Rachel is.  Rachel is very hot.  I don't know how the people in Instant Feedback know your assistant's really hot, 
[02:24:00]  but they know.  Brooke Hogan and the show starts, unless I'm fucking this up, too.  It starts this Sunday, 10 o'clock on VH1.  Brooke Knows Best.  It's season two in Miami.  There you go.  And when does my album drop?  Please.  Everybody knows the album drops in July 21st, The Redemption.  Who doesn't know that?  But I knew that on my own.  Yeah, you did know that.  Yes.  Very good, because I said it.  Just kidding.  But at least I remembered it.  I still love you.  You're good.  Thank you, Brooke.  Brooke, thank you.  It was a pleasure.  Thank you so much.  Drink that muscle milk.  You saw that.  It's embarrassing, right?  No.  It's protein, though. 
[02:24:30]  No, it's actually really good.  My dad drinks it.  Say, thank you, Ed.  See, Hulk drinks it.  The Hulk drinks it.  And now stop.  You're like a little Hulkamaniac.  You just don't drink it out of the container, because it looks really gay.  No, it doesn't.  That's actually really good stuff.  All right, cool.  He splashes the last bit on his back.  Yeah, well.  What are you going to do?  Brooke Hogan, everyone.  Thanks, Brooke.  Get time for a photo.  Bye, guys.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Brooke Hogan.  She did good. 
[02:25:00]  She was forthcoming.  She was honest.  Someone on Instant Feedback writes, you're so fake.  You guys bashed the shit out of her album and called them creeps for the suntan thing.  And then you sucked up to Brooke.  And?  What are you going to do, man?  And I said to Opie when we first saw that, what was that?  An Instant Feedback from all of our subconsciouses? 
[02:25:30]  We know it.  We know.  We don't need to be told.  Dude, she's so fucking sexy in person.  I am going to update my Brooke Hogan knowledge and info.  Yeah.  She's way hotter in person.  Yeah.  Doesn't look like a giant Amazon woman in person.  I like that.  She's very well proportioned.  She's big, but she's not fat.  She's juicy, man.  She's like just a tall girl. 
[02:26:00]  I would definitely like to see that nude.  Oh, I thought you were going to say in a snowsuit.  All right.  Well, because everyone knew you were going to say nude.  Nude.  Nude.  I want to see her nude.  She's a little baby fat, but not in a bad way, but a very sexy feminine way.  She's really juicy, man.  The cleft chin, though.  I don't care about it.  I wouldn't even notice it.  That's a little rough on a girl.  I wouldn't care if she had a football helmet on.  A little rough.  I didn't notice that.  A little rough, though.  I mean, considering that, you know, I mean, she's an actress now. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, shit.  What?  She's starring in a movie with Kelly Osbourne, Jimmy.  Yeah.  What is that movie about that she's in?  What part does she play?  You asked the question, so you must have did all your research.  Yeah.  What's this indie film?  Well, it's an indie film called Devour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is apparently what our staff does with shitty information and fucking print it out.  Now, a lot of shows do pre-interviews.  We don't do pre-interviews.  Yeah, we're starting to do pre-interviews.  Are we? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Are we?  Absolutely we are.  We couldn't in that case because she's doing a million shows here at SiriusXM.  Howard would like everyone to think that he was the only one talking to her today, but  she's pretty much doing 10 channels today.  Yes, she is.  Sam, why the misinformation?  Well, Devour, I'll take blame for that, but I doubled.  It's on IMDB and it's all over the place online.  So, I mean, that is a rumor that just happened to not be true, but it was on Wikipedia.  It's not the rumor.  Well, maybe it is true, but she doesn't feel like talking about it yet. 
[02:27:30]  That happens sometimes.  No, I could tell by her reaction.  She had never.  I could have said to her, so how was your trip to Jupiter?  And that would have had the fucking same reaction.  What?  Did you feel uncomfortable?  No.  I didn't care because it was on the paper.  It's not like I ran in with it and go, God, guess what?  I got the skinny.  What was the other thing she schooled you on?  Oh, well, the fact that her website, brookhoganmusic.com.  And she goes, no, it's Brooke's World.  And what was your...  And something about her music, too, she schooled you on. 
[02:28:00]  Sam, what about the...  Oh, she wants to know if I knew one of her album would come out.  Yeah.  What about the website, Fauxpas?  That one is justifiable in my case because when Roland was doing the booking, Roland would  always send me the plug information and everything that this guest is plugging, blah, blah, blah.  By the way, by the way, let me just tip you off a little.  Watch it be passed, yeah.  I'm seeing a little passing here to someone that hasn't been here.  No, no, no, no.  In quite a while, Roland somehow is responsible for this. 
[02:28:30]  He's a big fan of the pass the buck thing that the staff does.  And it doesn't...  You don't have to directly pass the buck when you pass the buck.  It's when anybody else's name comes up to kind of deflect a little.  The best way to pass the buck is just keep it vague.  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of keep it vague.  Bring up someone else's name.  Like Roland.  Keep it vague.  Like Roland.  Sam's thinking Roland.  He's not going to be on the show anytime soon, and I'm sure he doesn't have satellite  radio.  See, the listener isn't going like, well, let me really determine what he's saying here. 
[02:29:00]  They just hear, oh, it was Roland's fault.  Roland's fault.  Not Roland's fault.  Roland never did anything wrong.  He always did right, and he always sent me the plug information, and that's why the  plugs were never wrong.  Now, unfortunately, Roland doesn't work with us anymore.  Oh, he's going to pass the buck.  This is rules.  Here he goes.  And the person who works for our show that the talent department communicates directly  with does not send me plug information on a consistent basis, so all I have is Google.  Who would that pay?  Steve C. 
[02:29:30]  Right?  So all I have is Google.  So Buck firmly passed to Steve C.  When you Google Brooke Hogan, he's not here today.  When you Google Brooke Hogan.  I didn't even notice.  Brooke's world doesn't even come up.  So the publicists would have had to tell us, and I'm sure that they would have or did,  that this is what she's promoting.  For whatever reason, I'm not given the plug information anymore.  I have to find it.  So when you went to brooksworld.com, what did you see? 
[02:30:00]  No, I didn't go.  I mean, what did you see on brookhoganmusic.com?  I just Googled it and saw, you know, on the homepage.  Wow.  That's not her.  Okay.  No.  It's not her site, obviously.  No, that's her site.  It's not her site.  It's bulkcdsale.com.  That's where it redirects you.  Here's where it goes.  H-U-S dot parkingspace dot com.  What?  Whatever.  If you go to brookhoganmusic.  If you go to brookhogan's music. 
[02:30:30]  No, I went to brookhoganmusic because that's what's listed here.  Oh, that was a typo then.  Well, either way, the wrong address is wrong.  Yeah.  So brookhoganmusic.  We can't even get the wrong address right.  Why don't we check this stuff?  We can't even get the wrong address right.  I love it.  That's brilliant.  And where's Steve?  Because you passed the buck on him.  I got to hear what Steve is going to say.  He's not here.  He's not here.  What?  Wow.  No one even noticed.  See, no one noticed.  Yeah, he's not here today.  Why isn't he here?  Are you kidding?  Where is he?  He's taking some kind of personal day.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  He did say that.  Does he have pneumonina, too? 
[02:31:00]  Like E-Rock?  Pneumonina.  He's got something with his family.  How many days is E-Rock going to milk this fucking thing?  Oh, my God.  Is he just fucking latching on to this pneumonia thing?  What the fuck?  He doesn't know if he'll be able to make it in this week.  For real?  What has he got?  That's, like, severely ill.  That's fucking swine flu ill.  Well, Ed, he hinted at that.  He goes, my doctor wants me to get the test.  Because of his body.  The test used to be the big one. 
[02:31:30]  That's what test out the doctor's new scale.  That's what they said after he got off a plane.  The test used to be the big one.  But now when the doctor says you need the test,  they're talking about the pandemic that is this wide flow.  Of course, Obama, you know, throwing $2 billion more.  He's being tested for H.I. weight.  See, you say it different.  It's high weight.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Please hold on.  Not high like hello. 
[02:32:00]  High like high like a lot of.  But then you heard the H.I., you thought I was going to say V.  But then I didn't.  I said weight.  Oh, high weight.  Instead of H.I. weight.  See, see, that's why I kind of stretched out the H.I. part  when everyone's going to go, okay, he's going to say H.I. V.  The more I understand it, the worse it gets.  That's an RV hitting an exploding.  You rock. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, what's up?  How you feeling?  I'm getting there.  How's the penino ohm in the, uh...  Besides from the liquid in my lungs, everything else is pretty good.  Yeah.  So why don't you just stand up and stop laying down?  It'll drain.  I do most of the day.  You have to kind of walk around for a while.  Go ahead, Stan.  Well, Sam was just telling us that you're faking it.  Okay.  For real.  Good comeback.  Why else would we call you?  Sam thinks you're faking. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, well.  You're welcome to come over here.  Let's see.  We're getting reports that the booth, when the call was made, says he didn't sound like  this 30 seconds ago.  Did you put on the sick voice just to make it look good?  I noticed it's getting more sick from the time he said hello.  And there was a cough.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, we're going to have to listen to this again, because right when he starts talking  to Opie, he doesn't sound as bad as he does right now. 
[02:33:30]  He's also laying down in bed here, and now I'm sitting up.  Oh, yeah?  So what's the deal?  How'd you get this?  Where'd it come from?  What are the doctors saying?  I think it started Wednesday.  Thursday got really bad.  How do you know it got really bad?  What happened?  Well, Wednesday night, it was just a cough.  It was just a non-stop cough.  And in the office, too.  Thursday, I started to get a fever.  Uh-oh.  And while I was in work on Friday, it was really, really bad. 
[02:34:00]  That's good.  What, your performance?  When did you start?  What did you say, Ant?  Nothing.  I'm trying to be nice.  Okay.  The poor sick E-Roc.  It's really bad.  So then you got a fever.  So then you're thinking, you're probably thinking swine flu, right?  I was hoping not because, you know, not like that would stop you from joking about it anyway. 
[02:34:30]  Bacon?  That's right.  But do you understand it's worse to get peninomonia than the swine flu?  Right.  Yeah, well, I didn't really pick and choose to get pneumonia.  I would rather get swine flu than the menomonia.  How do you say that P-N thing?  Pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  That's how it's pronounced.  Pneumonia.  There's a P in front.  Pneumonia.  Of course you say it.  So then you went to the doctor?  Yeah, went to the doctor Monday after the vet.  The vet.  And what did he say? 
[02:35:00]  Did they take your Mayo pressure?  Oh, fuck.  I had a good one.  I said a blood pressure, Mayo pressure.  Mayo pressure.  Fuck.  Pneumonia.  Damn it.  So what did the doctor say?  Yeah.  Went in.  She listened to my lungs and everything like that.  And she said I had pneumonia.  Was it gurgling and stuff?  Was it a sucking chest wound sound? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, give us a good gurgling sound so we believe you.  Yeah, give us a...  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, what you got on the scale in the doctor's office?  Did somebody run in and put a blue rivet on you?  Because they do that at the county fair.  People that can't figure it out.  Fuck it.  Sorry. 
[02:36:00]  Sorry, Iraq.  What are you taking for your pneumonia, sweetie?  He's gone.  Iraq?  Did he hang up on us?  Oh, my God.  Did Iraq hang up?  I think so.  Oh, he didn't like that line.  Why?  We didn't get to all the other fun things.  Sugar cubes.  Flat your hand.  The medicine in it.  We'll get to him.  Yeah.  Call him back.  Dial 1-800-PIGGY. 
[02:36:30]  He probably broke his nose trying to root under a fence.  Why did he hang up on us?  I don't know.  Lady Trucker wants to do a backstage with O&A with Sam on air.  I don't know what that...  That could have potential.  And why did Sam leave?  Because Matt wants to stick up for...  For Sam.  For Sam.  Why Sam?  Matt in Virginia. 
[02:37:00]  What's up, bubba boys?  Hello, Matt.  Hey, I rarely agree with Sam.  But in this case, I would have to say he's about 90% right.  The Brooke Hogan Music website is the official Sobe, her label, whatever website, where you  can buy all of her shit, get the news.  Brooke Hogan Music or Brooke Hogan's Music?  BrookeHoganMusic.com.  So we had that, right, Jimmy?  What is Brooke Hogan Music, Danny?  Or Brooke Hogan's Music. 
[02:37:30]  Exactly.  You're saying...  I know I'm right, fuck.  I know I'm right.  I knew it'd get to this point, Jimmy.  I looked at Brooke Hogan Music.  It's a fucking seedy sight.  Is it possible you didn't fuck it up in the read, Jimmy?  I...  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Is it possible what?  No, I'm looking at it right now.  It says Brooke Hogan Music.  All right, then Sam's a fuckface.  Yes, I know he is.  Well, there's a guy that called to stick up for you, Sam. 
[02:38:00]  You're now fuckface.  You're now fuckface.  And another guy's like, Sam, how can you blame a guy that's not at work today?  Because he's supposed to send me the information already.  That's how I'm supposed to get it.  How can anybody find Brooke's World.com?  Because even if we had said BrookeHogan'sMusic.com, she would have said, that's the wrong website.  Yeah.  So how on earth could I find Brooke's World.com?  Did you ask...  Well, you're doing the prep sheets.  Did you ask Steve for the plugs?  We all know he's a boob.  I've asked him... 
[02:38:30]  Every guest that comes in, I say, send me the plug, send me the plug, send me the plug.  And what was his response?  He doesn't respond to emails.  You know, the correct website is on her Wikipedia as her official website.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, but that's the same place it says all the other stuff.  You've got to cross-reference.  Yeah.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I googled Brooke Hogan and Brooke...  You what?  Google.  And brooksworld.com.  I googled.  I googled.  But you googled a name and brooksworld.com doesn't come up anyway.  What?  Why would it?  It's not her site. 
[02:39:00]  All right, hold on.  Brooksworld.com is not her site.  It shouldn't come up.  E-Rock's live from his death fest.  Oh, it's right.  Oh, it's right.  Oh, Brooke's music's live.  Let's get back to E-Rock.  We'll get back to Sam.  Dumb bitch she is.  Hey, Lady Trucker, you hold on.  I don't know if...  She's trying to redeem herself from yesterday's horrendous phone call.  Damn.  E-Rock.  Combined weight of an oil tanker on the phones right now.  Why did you hang up on us?  I don't know.  You call me and all the time I'm hearing is fucking pig jokes and blue ribbon shit. 
[02:39:30]  That bothers you.  Well, I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I didn't mean to imply that.  What did you think we were calling for?  To say hi and give you best wishes?  Are you feeling better?  I want to put a diving board on your chest and fucking swim into your lungs.  I bet you he...  I bet you he was hoping we would call because we just didn't know where to, you know, send the fruit basket.  Yeah, we're concerned.  How are you feeling?  Better?  By the way, a fruit basket is Steve with wicker wrapped around him. 
[02:40:00]  I thought that was an incompetent basket.  Yes, it is.  So how's the number none?  Yeah, how is it?  How are you?  How are you feeling?  It's better than it was.  So you'll be back tomorrow, hopefully?  I should be back in tomorrow.  Yeah, because the place is falling apart with you.  Yeah.  I'm sure it is.  We didn't even notice you weren't here.  We didn't notice Steve wasn't here.  Not at all.  I mean, are you still feverish?  Not as much, no.  Did you roll around in the mud to cool off? 
[02:40:30]  Are you getting back on the phone?  Are you getting back on the phone?  Are you getting back on the phone?  These fucking Blue Ribbon jokes?  Yeah.  I picked that fucking Blue Ribbon joke.  What do you want me to say?  All right.  Do political humor to you?  Steve-  I thought we were going to call up and be like, are you okay?  Do you need anything? 
[02:41:00]  Stephen S.  Call me.  Stephen S.  Did you say E-Rock's lie from his breath bed?  All right, hold on.  E-Rock wants political jokes.  Sorry.  Yeah, get E-Rock back in the line.  He's a repiglican.  Lady Trucker, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Speak of the devil.  A Democrat.  What's up?  I think I ought to do a special edition of Backstage with O&A.  Okay.  Sam.  Prime time fuck up Sam Roberts. 
[02:41:30]  Is there a...  How long are you going to be in denial?  Holy shit.  Sam, she's trashing you.  What am I in denial about?  I'm explaining my thought process behind the mistakes that were made.  Ooh.  Okay, Sam.  Now, is it true, then, in your state of denial that you've changed your Twitter name to not fuck up Sam?  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  No, you didn't.  Boy, when you take the gloves off.  You certainly are crazy.  You're a lady trucker.  First of all, I appreciate the Twitter plug.  And second of all, I just said I wasn't in a state of denial. 
[02:42:00]  I'm explaining my thought process behind the mistakes that were made.  I didn't say anybody else wrote them.  I explained why they were written.  Well, you know, you're acting like the true tween that you are.  Real adults, real grown-ups.  All right.  I'm hanging up on her, because we're losing our EROC momentum.  Oh, I wanted to ask her if it was odd to have the trailer actually be heavier than the...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[02:42:30]  You hung up on me.  Uh-oh.  I got all grown.  Uh-oh.  I pat it back out of that one.  That's a great fat joke.  What's it like to not be as fat as the truck?  Yes.  Oh, wait.  That's correct.  That was correct.  How come I always get them backwards?  I have joke dyslexia.  They're supposed to be funny, and they're not.  Two owners walk into a Jew.  They bar it.  Where's the crowd going?  Steven S. has another line.  God damn it.  He wants us to call EROC back and tell him that we're willing to pay for the flatbed truck 
[02:43:00]  if he needs to go to the hospital.  A little call back from yesterday.  Fucking flatbed tractor.  Let's get him on the phone.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah, it's not good.  Pneumonia is a very serious thing.  Sure it is.  Mm-hmm.  Get old Lake Long's back on the phone.  I want to talk to him.  Jason Voorhees drowned in his fucking chest.  Someone else wants to know if his fiancee is working.  And who's flipping EROC over so he doesn't get bed sores? 
[02:43:30]  Poor EROC.  He's got pneumonia.  All right, EROC's back.  Everyone's being mean to him.  EROC.  We're just kidding, EROC.  Yeah, everything's good.  Come on.  EROC.  How you doing, man?  EROC.  E to the rock, right?  Yeah.  So you're going to be back in tomorrow.  The doctor does say you're doing better.  Yeah.  Now, don't you take...  Now, I know pneumonia isn't a viral thing.  Right.  So you can take, what, penicillin for it?  What do you take?  Antibiotics? 
[02:44:00]  Walk us through it, EROC.  What's happening?  Let us know.  Go.  They have me on Levaquin.  What's that?  It's an antibiotic.  750 milligrams.  Oh.  Kenny's in.  Now, do they give you pills for that?  Or does a guy in khakis just kind of fire a dart into you when you need to?  Can you get EROC on the phone?  Why is he hanging up?  Hold on, Kenny.  We'll get EROC on. 
[02:44:30]  Because Kenny obviously has something for EROC.  Kenny ran in and put headphones on.  Oh, good.  Well, they mentioned the doctor, so I wanted to ask them a question.  Yeah, please.  Oh, shit.  Did EROC?  I mean, Kenny obviously wouldn't say anything stupid.  Holy Jesus Christ, man.  Goddamn Jimmy's ruthless.  Dogshit sniffer.  His girlfriend knows when he's throwing up when she hears the bell around his neck clanging. 
[02:45:00]  Dogshit sniffer.  Dogshit sniffer.  Get EROC on.  He's got pneumonia.  You can't fuck around with that shit.  We all know that.  Is he back?  We're just kidding.  Yeah.  Got to give him a hard time.  But we do want to see him get better, obviously.  Yeah, of course.  I don't like when EROC's not here.  Oh.  Hold on.  I think we might have him.  Okay.  Oh, shit. 
[02:45:30]  Someone is saying that he's lying.  Oh, no.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  That he's lying about what?  The, uh...  Well, I don't want to say about what because then he'll have an answer.  Ah.  Oh, okay.  Let me see a minute.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  So don't say anything.  Right?  Right?  Right.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Where is he?  Uh, just tuning in.  He's looking for the phone.  Retialing with cloven hooves. 
[02:46:00]  Sarah from Buffalo's got something, too.  Yeah.  Look at what Sarah's saying.  Now he's not...  Now we're on to him, so now he's gonna...  He better pick up his phone.  Get septic lungs on the fucking phone.  I want to talk to him.  I can't see that one.  Uh, this one...  I can't say, because this one right here, you see?  Okay, well, I think, uh...  This one.  Right here.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Uh-huh. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, what's up?  Oh, wait, we got him on.  Yeah.  All right, E-Rod, Kenny's in here, but first, a couple things.  Uh-huh.  Bonnie in D.C. writes...  My husband's a retard.  Oh, wait, there's Bonnie in Jersey.  She writes, they wouldn't diagnose pneumonia without a chest x-ray, so you're lying.  Did they do an x-ray?  No, they didn't do an x-ray.  Now, why wouldn't they do that? 
[02:47:00]  I think that's common practice to see the fluid in the lungs.  It's got a little maybe bronchitis or something.  You could come to work with that shit.  Some people are also saying...  Hey, and what drug are you on?  Yeah, what are you on?  Levaquin.  Levaquin.  L-E-V-A-Q-U-I-N.  Oh, yeah, the drug that is used for severe kidney infections.  Is that it?  Perhaps it's an antibiotic.  Very strong.  Mm-hmm.  Some people are saying you should be on Lasix.  Hey, Eric.  Maybe they should give you some oinkment. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Thanks, Kenny.  Thanks, Kenny.  Thanks, Kenny.  That's not even worth getting mad at.  I know.  Jesus, Kenny was excited for that one.  So horrible.  So you're on Levaquin.  What does exactly that do?  What is that?  How does it help clear it up?  One huge tablet that you take for five days.  Yeah.  Jersey Matt writes, I didn't realize that Cloverfield could be brought down by something as simple as a cold.  Oh, come on.  Now it's not Cloverfield.  No.  And Dr. Steve wants to clarify some stuff. 
[02:48:00]  If we can get him on the phone.  Yeah, let's talk to Dr. Steve and let him help make sure that young Eric is taking the right medicine.  Yeah.  You have a kidney infection because that's what that drug is used for.  No, Danny?  It does say it's used for lung infection.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry.  His kidneys are fine.  Peter Cleveland, he writes, E-Roc should be on Trim Spa.  Oh, no.  See, that's crazy because he's got pneumonia. 
[02:48:30]  Does this thing help, like the pill you're taking, does it help actually just get the gravy out of the lungs?  E-Roc, is it a mayo blocker?  E-Roc, comment?  He's gone again.  He's gone.  What's wrong with this guy?  He really is.  Get off the fat jokes.  I don't think he's got pneumonia. 
[02:49:00]  He's a liar.  He's a liar.  He's got the sniffles.  He wrapped that pill up in a little slice of bacon, put it down his throat.  Yeah, he did.  Rub his throat so it goes down.  Penis wrinkle.  Yeah, I wanted to know how E-Roc caught the pneumonia.  Was he truffle hunting?  Was he what?  Truffle hunting.  Get him back on the phone.  I do want to ask him some questions.  Dr. Steve.  The good doctor. 
[02:49:30]  Dr. Steve, how are you, sir?  Hello.  Hey.  Because if poor Eric is all wrapped up in his blanket, he reminds me of a cocktail treat.  Eric is claiming pneumonia, but we don't think he has the pneumonia because he didn't get  the chest x-ray.  Yeah, there's, you know, you can hear it when you listen, but most doctors would get an x-ray.  There are some that will cut corners and just treat you for it.  So that's inside the realm of possibility. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  So it's not like he's absolutely lying.  Steve, what do you think he really has?  Well, he probably has bronchitis, or he could have had the influenza.  I mean, I don't know if they tested him for influenza.  That would be the next thing to ask him.  Yeah, because that's real nice that he was in here feeling all shitty, and he had influenza  that was, you know, exposing everybody to it.  He quit Sam in the little studio, right?  Yeah, right.  On Friday. 
[02:50:30]  With Sam?  Yes, Sam.  Are you sick?  You've been hanging out with E-Roc.  Feeling okay?  Well, I thought I had allergies, but...  Are you going to sniff him a little bit?  Yeah, and a short throat.  But, you know, if I had seen him with a fever and the complaints that he had, I probably would  have done an influenza screen.  And if it was negative, then he either just had some badass virus or he had pneumonia.  Now, you put your stethoscope on the chest and you hear crackles, then you can make the diagnosis  of pneumonia clinically. 
[02:51:00]  You would usually verify it by doing a chest x-ray.  If he continues to be sick, then they'll have to do a chest x-ray.  Now, you'll have to put him down.  Now, Steve, is there any way...  Put a tarp on him.  Is there any way you could sort of diagnose him over the phone by having him maybe do  something or ask him a question that he wouldn't really know the answer to and would have to  answer honestly?  Well, that'd be a tough one.  Yeah.  You know, we could have him put the phone up to his chest and have him breathe, and that 
[02:51:30]  might be interesting.  I've never done that before.  I wonder what that'll sound like.  No, but it'd be kind of like, guess what's in my pants?  Guess what's in my lungs?  Where is that idiot?  Yeah, can we get him back on?  I don't know why he keeps hanging up on us.  Stupid Iraq.  Come on.  Yeah.  So what are you up to, Dr. Steve?  Making any more wine?  You know, I got a wine cellar now.  I think I need a couple of bottles of Dr. Steve's wine.  Squeeze Eric's lungs out of Steve's wine. 
[02:52:00]  I absolutely have some that I'm sending you.  I'm ready for another dose of...  Yeah.  Lose my address.  Lose my address.  Jesus.  That's the good doctor on the phone, Opie.  Yeah.  How about some good wine, then?  Okay.  So do they toss you out of here as far as your show goes, or what happened?  Yeah, you know, I don't know.  Well, we're going to be on June 20th when Sam and Dave do a live show. 
[02:52:30]  And we're working on doing some live shows from Nashville, and then we'll make the Hodge to New York City at least once a year.  But as far as a scheduled show, I think we're pretty much fucked.  I don't know.  Fuck.  Pretty much fucked.  We've got to figure all that shit out.  I know.  It was a good time.  Listening to The Callers, very honest medical show.  We're so ready for a second channel. 
[02:53:00]  So ready.  Or a third.  No, for real.  So ready.  If they had just a few bucks laying around, we could program a second channel.  That would rock.  Yeah.  A lot of these comedian friends of ours want to do some time.  If there were a few bucks, you've got the Dr. Steve, you've got the Laz, you've got...  Who are some of those other people doing the virus on the Saturday nights?  Uber?  Big Kel Geekster?  Well, the phones are lit, but I don't know what they want to talk about, so... 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  And E-Rock's not calling back.  No, he's resting.  Joe Wagner from South Jersey.  If E-Rock puts the phone up to his body, all you're going to hear is his stomach rumbling.  In a constant state of hunger.  We'll let the good doctor go.  He's a busy man.  Yeah.  All right, Mr. Dr. Steve.  All right, boys.  Good hearing from you.  You too.  Talk to yourself. 
[02:54:00]  To put the phone to E-Rock's chest would be like listening to an oiled Derek.  See, because his cholesterol is a little on the high side.  That's from Phoenix.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Thank you, doctor.  All right.  Be good.  Bye, Dr. Steve.  Should we take a break?  I don't think we...  Steve's a good egg.  I think...  Oh, we got E-Rock back?  Stay late and a dollar short.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  You all right?  Hi, E-Rock.  We want you to put the phone up to your chest and breathe in and out kind of deep. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Hang on.  There you go.  Oh.  That sounded a little...  Ugh. 
[02:55:00]  Again.  Anything else?  Could you do it again, E-Rock, please?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't sound good.  That doesn't sound good.  E-Rock, your lungs sound like shit. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, that's not happening.  Holy shit.  E-Rock?  E-Rock?  Hey, E-Rock.  We're not getting him back now.  There's no way he's calling back.  He rolled over on the phone now.  It looks like a fruit roll-up.  What's your name, fat body?  Open your mouth!  Oh, Adam K. 
[02:56:00]  I'm gay in Jersey.  If we had E-Rock put the phone up to his chest, all you would hear is E-Rock's heart screaming,  help me.  He's pretty disgusted at this point, I guess.  Why?  All the shenanigans and tomfoolery.  We're very concerned about our buddy.  Oh, are we?  Yes.  You can tell.  Scott asks from Quakertown, I bet since he's sick, he can't clean his house.  It must look like a real pigsty. 
[02:56:30]  Mmm.  If you put a phone up to E-Rock's chest, it would sound like a lava lamp.  I didn't realize there were so many cholesterol jokes out there.  All right.  Maybe he'll drop some weight.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe he'll lose a little weight.  From his neck to his stomach.  And yet, I mean, some of us fans of the flu diet or what, huh? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, see?  Wake up after a few days and you're like, look at me looking thinner.  Yeah, I didn't eat.  I'm feeling better.  A little bit, a little bit.  Yep.  Should we take a break and we'll do some real stuff?  I have a question for the audience, too.  I need assistance with something.  Oh.  What's that, Jimmy?  Nothing bad.  Just to email me with something.  I'm working on something.  And the concept is places where people behave rudely and how they behave rudely in these  places, whether it's a supermarket or anywhere, experiences you've had. 
[02:57:30]  And make them real.  You know, little things, little brief ones.  Gas station, wherever it is, that people behave rudely.  I have one.  Where?  That you mentioned, the supermarket.  The don't move the cart out of the way, motherfucker.  Yes.  And I'm not talking for two seconds or anything.  Some people shop and they put the cart right in the middle.  I will parallel park my cart next to the aisle when I'm looking at something.  And that way people can go right through.  People will just put it right across the aisle and then walk away. 
[02:58:00]  And I come up and you know what I start doing?  You know that little bottom piece on the shopping cart where you put like charcoal and  stuff?  That down low thing?  It kind of is hinged.  I start kicking that as I walk and my cart goes, coming down the aisle.  So people know I'm coming.  That's pretty smart.  Yeah.  The real Jim Norton at gmail.com.  Please email me these things.  And Danny had sent me a note. 
[02:58:30]  Antsman food shopping.  Let's be honest.  When the fuck, when you bring your cart into the liquor store and everybody else is holding  those little hand things, and Anthony actually has a push cart that he took from the fucking  stop and shop.  He actually goes in there.  Can I tell a very, very true story about that real quick?  Yeah, but he goes in there with a forklift.  Who are you kidding?  Not a fucking shopping cart.  A fucking pallet.  Load it up, boys.  Right.  This should do me good for the weekend.  When the bar first went in and Keith and I went to the liquor store to stock it, we did 
[02:59:00]  get a full-size shopping cart.  A shopping cart.  To stock it.  Nice.  To stock it with booze.  Whoops.  A lot of people want to know if we could call E-Rock back and find out what the spider  is writing in the web.  That's a great Charlotte's Web joke.  Wow, yeah.  That's right.  Fucking Wilbur Nagel.  Jesus.  Some dope. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, what are those things called?  The sprinkler?  If you hold a lighter up to a sprinkler, it will fucking spit water out, right?  Yeah, it's called a sprinkler.  Sprinkler head.  Isn't there halo in that?  Halogen.  Used to be halogen.  Halogen.  Then they found out that if you were in the room with the halogen, you would die.  Yeah.  But, you know, if you're in the room with the fire, you're dead too, so.  All right.  We're going to break.  I'll upload that stuff.  I think we're going to play the new game we like playing where I give Anne a few choices. 
[03:00:00]  Ah.  Well, because you brought some things up earlier and teased them, and I was like, what?  We got to talk about the convenience store guy after the break.  Yeah, but there was something else, too.  What?  There was something else that I was like, I don't know.  I know what it was, I think.  What?  The kid shows created.  Oh, yay!  Yay!  What was that again?  25 shows that must have been, the kid shows that must have been created under the influence  of drugs.  Yeah, why don't we start thinking about during the break, and you guys can help us with this 
[03:00:30]  list, okay?  Kid shows that had to have been created by adults on drugs, because they're so fucking  whacked out.  Yay!  And do you know a lot of these shows?  Because these shows, I think, happened after I grew up.  I saw the list.  There's a few.  I know a few.  There's a few I don't know, but I do think there's a few that have been omitted from  that list.  And there's explanations why they think this, hopefully?  Yeah.  Because that'll make this a bit worse.  I just got to ask if one show is on there.  All right.  They're newer?  Mm-hmm.  Well, it ranges. 
[03:01:00]  It ranges.  Is my favorite kid show of all time, Lazy Town, on there?  Oh.  Give yourself a bill!  The little girl with the pink hair?  I don't even know.  I know who you're talking about.  She's going to be hot.  Oh, Marjorie.  I think she grew up already.  Have you watched that show?  No, I flipped through it, and I saw the girl with the pink hair, and I'm like, I bet she's  going to be really hot.  Dude, look.  Come on.  Stop it.  What a fucking creep.  Help me share.  What's wrong with that?  Why is the girl a creep, Jimmy? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, why is the girl a creep?  What do you mean?  That's awful.  All right.  Let me look.  Dude.  She's got...  You've got to look at what she's going to be cultivating.  Yeah, she's got youth on her side, but she's ugly.  She's going through an awkward stage.  She is ugly.  The terrible twos?  No.  She's going through an awkward phase.  Oh, Anthony got something wrong today.  That is very rare.  What happened?  It's not halogen.  It's halon.  Oh, right.  Halogen's a headlight. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  Wow, you got something wrong.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I did make a mistake there.  I'll give you this.  Halon.  Halogen.  I'll give you this.  Thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends, for coming to my birthday.  When am I getting the other one?  It's so good to laugh.  I don't know.  Nothing beats that.  E-Rock was supposed to do it, but he's going to milk this.  Oh, yeah.  See, that was an actual shot.  Well, mine is Brian Peppers in the corner there. 
[03:02:30]  Why don't you explain that shot?  Is that real?  Yeah, that's a screen cap, sure.  No, it isn't.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's doing a little dance.  I'm sure it's in the middle of an action shot.  She's on her back, and her nose is trying to touch her knees, basically.  Yeah, and there's some gentleman with a mustache right in her crotch area.  But you see, her arms are hooked.  Like, she's laying on someone's back, and her arms are hooked, so that's probably in  the middle of doing some flip, and it's just a still shot.  You're right, you're right, yeah.  Oh. 
[03:03:00]  But it looks very suspect.  Oh.  In that.  Scooby-Doo, total drug show.  Well, we'll find out after the break.  They should have called it Scooby-Dooby.  Yep.  Oh, no, do it.  It's not mine.  All right, let's break.  Let's just hit that thing. 
[03:03:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, I checked out the Weeby cam.  Is it Weeby or Weeb?  Weeby.  No, no, it's Weeby.  Weeby, right?  Yes.  And I believe in what Twin Galaxy has to say.  And Billy Mitchell sucks dick.  And did we see a kill screen yesterday?  There was a kill screen at the E3, the electronics expo.  Oh, yeah, the E3 was pretty popular yesterday. 
[03:04:00]  G4 was covering it.  G4 certainly was.  If anyone's interested.  If anyone's interested, there was a kill screen.  No one is interested.  If anyone's interested, there's a kill screen.  Kill screen coming up.  Coming up.  Kill screen.  Kill screen.  Yeah.  Do yourself a favor and watch Chasing Ghosts.  Ghosts.  And the King of Kong.  King of Kong, I feel was.  Which one's better?  Well, see, they're two different documentaries.  I understand that, Dan.  I'm with you.  There's way more drama and story going on in King of Kong. 
[03:04:30]  Yes.  And Chasing Ghosts is more just kind of, here's information for you.  Did you just say Chasing Ghosts?  Oh, I did.  It's Chasing.  Ted, help us out.  Chasing Ghosts.  Chasing?  Chasing?  Yes.  Chasing Ghosts.  Chasing Ghosts.  It's too hard to say.  My lips press down towards my neck too hard.  So I have to harden up the process to make it a Z.  Oh, here comes the cracky old fuck for today's show.  Chasing Ghosts. 
[03:05:00]  Where's this fucking old man baloney tits?  I don't want to look, but tell me when this man.  Oh, my God.  I'm going down the hall and he'll give his dirty look like he gives every fucking day.  Oh, my God.  Who is this man?  It's Darth Vader without his helmet.  Oh, my God.  The guy from the operation game is walking down the hallway.  Who is this man?  Oh, my God.  Oh, he gave you a finger today.  Oh, he flipped us the bird.  Oh, I finally got to him.  Wow, I really got to him. 
[03:05:30]  He did smile, though.  He flipped the bird right through the window at him.  He knows that.  We talk about him every fucking day.  He hears us.  So?  Who gives a shit?  You know who I haven't seen?  I saw him, but we were too busy.  Oh, I saw him, too.  Opie, we're never too busy.  I couldn't.  What was happening that we couldn't turn around and then take a look at little Nicky?  Brooke Hogan was showing us her pussy.  No, she wasn't.  She was just talking.  You could have won.  Excuse me.  One minute.  One minute. 
[03:06:00]  Look who's coming down the hallway.  It's little Nicky.  And we'd all go, oh, little Nicky.  It's little Nicky.  And then he'd have waved and the day would have been complete.  Bunch of bullshit.  And here's Troy.  Troy, what's up, buddy?  See, we had the long hallway and people walked by to get to there.  And here's Mashup Nicole.  Get Mashup Nicole in here.  Mashup.  Come on in here.  I just farted again.  Oh, my God.  Nicole.  Jesus Christ, Danny.  This is bad timing and we didn't mean to do this. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  But we wanted to say hi to you real fast.  And Jimmy goes, please don't do this.  I did just fart again.  What's the matter with you?  Because the last time you were in here, Jimmy farted.  Yeah, I know.  I was aware.  It's terrible.  I hear we're breaking up the Mashup team because a lot of the guys that do the show with you,  very jealous that your Twitter got promoted heavily on our show and theirs did not.  Well, you're not breaking us up.  You'll never break us up.  But, yeah, I think there might be a little jealousy there, you know, and thank you for  that love.  I did.  It went up like a couple hundred. 
[03:07:00]  No, we did more than that for you.  How much?  I don't know.  Maybe five?  Six hundred?  That's pretty good, right?  Yeah, it was sizable.  Thank you, guys.  See?  Look how jealous he is.  We don't need you, bro.  You don't smell nice.  We don't need you.  And you don't look good in outfits like that.  I mean, you could try if you want.  They don't have the ladies, so, you know.  We got the ladies for sure.  Did you guys get to talk to Brooke Hogan?  She's actually going to be hosting my show, Hitbound, on the weekend.  So, we didn't talk to her.  We've actually hung out with her a bunch of times and the whole family. 
[03:07:30]  She admitted to us that her mom does coke.  No, she didn't.  Don't make up stories.  That's what I heard.  Because that gets us in trouble.  Well, she is asking her to take a drug test.  I didn't know that it was cocaine.  I figured it was, you know, she was smoking doobies.  She hinted at the coke, but she doesn't want to say it.  Did she hint at the coke?  I'm not saying a word, Mr. Mayor's Dead Idea Guy.  Well, she's hanging out with someone who's 30 years younger than her, who probably is,  you know, doing all sorts of things.  Yeah, that's true.  There are two things I wanted to tell you.  Let me think of the first. 
[03:08:00]  Okay.  Oh, the MTV Movie Awards.  Yeah.  Please tell me that you guys are smart enough to say right away that was a stunt.  What, with Eminem?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, it was a stunt.  No, but everyone knows now, but when it first hit, you guys were all over it, right?  Yes, all over it, because Eminem would not have allowed that to happen.  But I heard that he knew he was coming down on him, but he didn't know it was going to  be in the thong, and so, you know.  Is that how they're playing it now?  Yeah.  Because since they showed the shot of Eminem as it was going on, I'm like, this is all 
[03:08:30]  pre-planned.  It's so obvious.  Yeah.  And then the other thing is actually a compliment.  Jimmy and I live in, we're neighbors.  Yes, we are.  I live in one building.  He lives to the building to my whatever.  Depends what you're facing.  You know our freaking supermarket?  Yes.  They play your show all day long.  They do?  And I forgot to tell you.  Yeah, kid.  And it finally hit me.  I'm like, wait a minute.  I know that voice, and I was listening.  I'm like, holy shit, they got SiriusXM on in our supermarket all the time, and the only 
[03:09:00]  channel they play is Hits1 or whatever.  Were you as excited as Kenny?  It's Nicole's 411.  Kenny, are you excited?  Oh, here it comes.  My mashup air check will debut soon.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  We can do it while Nicole's in the studio.  We can do it right now.  Why don't we get the whole mashup in here?  Fuck those guys.  Oh, those are my boys.  You stop.  Kenny, what did they say to you, though?  Be honest.  You can't divide and conquer.  I'm not.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll kill you.  We understand the divide and conquer, so Anthony's right about that. 
[03:09:30]  But what did the guys say after Nicole got the big promotion on our show?  I know.  They're all second, third, and fourth fiddle to Nicole.  Thank you, Kenny.  And they wanted you to help out.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm going to be the king of the mashup now.  I don't know about that.  I don't know.  The king of the mashup.  You are not going to be the king of anything.  How about, what do we do?  You're busy, obviously.  I do have to run to a meeting, but I wanted to stop in for just a moment with my boss,  Kid Kelly.  I know Kid Kelly.  Yeah, he's got a big wig around here.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Are you seeing anyone?  I am, actually.  Are you seeing?  I am.  He's looking at his phone.  He didn't even look over at her.  Yeah, I know.  He goes, are you seeing anyone?  Like, an interview.  Who are you seeing?  She Twitters about her BF.  Yes, I do.  We're going to move in together, I think, in August.  Wow.  How long have you been with this bum?  Like nine months.  That's too soon.  I know.  Obsessed.  I'm a little nervous, I'm not going to lie, but I think I'm ready.  And you get along well?  Yeah.  Why are you nervous?  You've spent some time together at a length where, you know, it's not like you're going 
[03:10:30]  to be like, holy shit, I didn't know he did this.  No, no, I think I know him, and I'm nervous because I'm a little younger than him.  Oh, what, is he 50?  No, no, no, he's only like six years older than me, but, you know, it's a big commitment.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  What are you nervous about, though?  I don't know, I just don't want it to be the wrong decision.  It's like, you know, to reverse that after you move in with someone is hell.  You can't wreck it.  You can't reverse it.  It's like impossible.  That's a very good point.  You don't want to ruin it.  You can't reverse that stuff, right?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It'll be a mess.  But yeah, he's a lovely, lovely guy, and I'm sure you guys would get along.  What is it? 
[03:11:00]  Why?  He's a cool guy.  He's fun.  How old is he?  He is 32.  What kind of work does he do?  He is.  That wasn't nice, Jimmy.  Why?  He's older than her, so she's younger.  Yeah, but now we know how old she is.  Why?  I wasn't going to go there, because she already gave us the math problem before that.  Oh, I didn't know what math she did.  I didn't hear it.  What's he do for work?  He works in sales.  Okay.  What nationality is he?  Is he a white guy, black guy, tall, small, Italian?  He's big.  He's like 6'2", 200 pounds, big blue eyes.  He would fuck you up.  Yeah.  Good luck to you. 
[03:11:30]  Big Aryan.  Yes, he is.  Now, depending on her answer, he's a good man.  He's 5'1".  He was paralyzed in a boating accident.  Now I can hit on her.  But he's 6'2", with big blue eyes, ex-linebacker.  Yeah.  Hope it works out.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you.  Hope your relationship flourishes.  Well, Kenny, I can't wait to hear your demo, and I'm going to get to that meeting.  Yeah, maybe tomorrow when you run.  Yeah.  Maybe we get the whole gang in here.  Yeah, definitely.  And we do like the other guys, but you know.  No, we don't.  We just don't want to talk to them.  We just don't want to talk to them, because they don't run around. 
[03:12:00]  You know, you run around naked and stuff.  Yeah, well, right.  Yeah.  I got that on them.  That's about it, though.  Yeah.  All right.  That's why he wants you to move in.  Of course he does.  But I just see you naked all the time.  No, he likes your family.  He caught a picture of your Nana, and he's like, I got to get around her nude.  Okay, I'm out of here.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  Nicole can only take so much of us.  I love it.  I love finding everyone's line around here.  They hate us.  They all like, they're fun, and then we just always blow it.  So what did the cranky old fuck gave us a finger today? 
[03:12:30]  Jimmy, that's good.  Yeah.  We're making a headway with him.  Getting to him.  Huh?  We're making a headway.  Definitely getting to him.  He fucking likes this.  She's got very nice breasts.  Jesus.  She's nice to everything, man.  She's got, she's probably got nice fucking corns on her feet.  I don't have a foot fetish, but I'd let her rub the corns on her feet across my eyeball.  I'd let her scrape, I'd let her fucking scrape my eye with her corn.  Doesn't sound very healthy.  As sexy as a motherfucker.  Mash up Nicole is Nicole's Twitter thing. 
[03:13:00]  And then Kenny could give the other Twitter guys a plug.  Because we don't, I don't really know.  I don't even know their names.  I just know Nicole does the show.  I don't know their names either.  I think Rich does because he's part of Covino and Rich.  Oh.  Or Rich and Covino, whatever the, what do we got?  Give them the plugs there, Kenny, so they feel good about themselves.  I'm the king of the mash up.  You're not the king of the mash up.  After my air check, I will be.  Do you want to do the air check?  You want to do the air check?  Like a child.  Yeah, I think we should. 
[03:13:30]  All of a sudden, what time is it?  He's fucking popping shit.  Yeah.  Like he's fucking, he's Bill Broadcaster.  I want to hear how good he is.  Kenny's getting too big for his fucking, getting.  Too big for his giant britches.  Yes.  Too big.  I couldn't think of something oaf-like.  The kid show thing might have to wait till tomorrow.  I don't know.  Let's see.  Maybe squeeze everything in.  Yeah.  Maybe we actually like do material today.  No.  Why are they closing the fucking curtain?  What?  I'm trying to think of what we're doing.  Is Kenny getting a shit at Joe? 
[03:14:00]  Why are we closing the curtain?  There's a surprise guest who wants to make an entrance.  This is going to suck.  I don't know.  Who?  Who?  Fucking surprise some mutant with white stuff on the corner of his mouth.  Kenny, do you know what's going on?  No.  Why would he?  Damn it.  He's only the guy with the gun.  Why would Kenny have any clue?  He's only the fucking security for this radio program.  All I want to hear is that thing go off when this guest comes in.  And then followed by an, oh my God, I'm sorry.  Hey.  What are you doing out of water? 
[03:14:30]  What is pneumonia doing here?  Well, I guess apparently it wasn't made clear that I really wasn't sick.  So I thought I would come in and, uh, you could evaluate for yourself.  And get everybody sick?  Hey, only one way to prove it, right?  Are you still contagious, you think?  Uh, yeah, for at least another day.  Why did you feel like you had to come in here?  Why not just take your beating?  Oh, I did.  He is huffing and puffing like a locomotive.  I figured it was a slow ride at 10.30, so I'd come in and, uh... 
[03:15:00]  You sort of look a little sick in the, uh, the eyes.  But that's not pneumonia.  No.  You want to do...  All right, do some push-ups.  Oh, God.  Or...  You'll kill him.  Hey, you want to do the bit.  Or do some...  No, I mean, if you kill him without pneumonia, it would kill him.  Do some jumping jacks.  Go like...  Huff.  Huff.  Nope.  Go...  Huff.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, okay.  That was a good nodule.  Sorry. 
[03:15:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Jimmy's not happy.  And I'm eating soup.  I don't mind if you're sick.  My immune system...  I'd fucking laugh at pneumonia.  My immune system is the shit...  Please stop.  I'm talking.  Sorry.  Don't be rude.  My immune system is very, very good.  Who comes in to work when they took a day off?  I don't know.  Especially when they do nothing when they're here anyway.  What kind of soup are you eating?  Chicken noodle.  Oh, it sounds yummy.  E-Rock, can you put the new clipper in the machine and then you can go home? 
[03:16:00]  I want the peewee thing where he goes, it's so good to laugh.  All right.  You're a weirdo.  I'm a weirdo.  He is.  Anyone else would have said, all right, I got beat up.  Now I'm just going to lay here and go back to my punch out.  Why punch out?  You all...  This is fun.  You all, like, fucked up from the fever?  Is that why you came here?  You thought you were going to the kitchen?  What happened?  No.  The fever is actually, uh, is down. 
[03:16:30]  Subsided.  Yeah.  It's almost...  Your fever's going down.  You're not even contagious anymore, you know?  You're really not contagious.  It's about a hundred, so it's not really a fever.  You know what?  People are shocked that you're actually sticking up for yourself today by coming in here.  Let's stick it up.  He's probably something here he needs.  Probably left like a fucking wrestling DVD box set here.  Exactly.  Hey, Hyman Roth.  Who's this skirt?  Who's this skirt walking down the hall?  Steve Carlici. 
[03:17:00]  Do you know that skirt?  No.  Must be new.  Wow, Woody.  Sassy black coat.  Your son.  Skirt.  Damn.  Sounds on out there.  I waved.  They just totally ignored me.  Of course they did.  Don't be intimidated by my chiseled chin.  Oof.  Shizzled off.  Don't go away from me.  All right, E-Rock.  I don't know what we're supposed to do with this.  Just saying hi.  Good.  And now what?  You're going to go back in your car and go home?  Well, I got a drop that you want to get. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, please.  So I'll go do that.  So the two awkward laughs.  So good to laugh.  And then the...  As he's trying to blow up.  You know what I'd like to happen to...  Even though you're sick.  I'd like you to sing,  All I want to do is zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,  as you throw yourself down an elevator.  Yeah.  What are the odds you're going to do that?  Boom.  There goes E-Rock.  All right.  Are you coming back tomorrow for real?  Place is falling apart without you.  Exactly. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Right.  Fucking beat it, cum lungs.  Danny's disinfecting the whole area now.  I don't want to get sick.  Dan, how unhappy are you that he just walked in?  Because you're the germ guy.  I'm not a germaphobe.  I'm a disgustophobe.  I'm sort of a germ guy.  I'm not happy that he was just in here.  Not happy.  You got to hope your immune system can hold up.  Oh, boy.  God.  God hope.  That's it.  That's all you got going for you. 
[03:18:30]  Kenny's morning mashup demo.  All right.  You know what?  Thug, A Crying Shame, or 25 Kid Shows That Must Have Been Created by Adults on Drew.  I say we go with the kid show because Kenny we could do tomorrow so we could spend more  time on it.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't like rushing through Kenny.  We need a lot of good Kenny.  We could play the Kenny thing early and then wait for the mashup people to get off the  air and then we'll play it again and see what they think.  That's even better.  But let's do the gun story fast and then we'll do the kid thing.  Because this is a current news story. 
[03:19:00]  Image from surveillance camera shows would-be robber in praying position begging for mercy  as Long Island store owner Mohammed Sohal.  So who gives a shit about him?  Sohal.  Which is funny because he's got a gun in his hand.  Sohal.  Yeah.  Hell of...  Oh, shit.  Well, the guy's got a shotgun.  What kind of shotgun is that in the picture? 
[03:19:30]  I don't think it's a shotgun.  Well, it says a wheeled shotgun.  It looks like kind of a sawed-off shotgun.  As I look at the picture...  I mean, it's not a...  For a moment.  Because that's not in the shotgun category.  As I look at the picture where he's holding a weapon in this hand, that barrel does not look  like a shotgun.  That looks like some old fucking got-it-from-his-great-grandfather gun.  I don't know what the hell that is.  For real?  I thought it was more... 
[03:20:00]  See, I don't know shit about guns.  I would say it's some kind of modern gun.  Here's the story.  It's pretty weird.  I don't know what to think on this one.  A shotgun-toting storekeeper gives the robber, the contrite robber, $40 and a loaf of bread.  What happened was a lucky Long Island bandit found compassion in an unlikely place, the  wrong end of a shotgun.  Convenience store owner Mohammed, after pulling a weapon on the would-be crook, sent the weeping  man home with $40 and a loaf of bread upon hearing he was broke and unemployed. 
[03:20:30]  The robber also vowed to end his life of crime before escaping with his life, the food, and  the cash.  He started crying, Mohammed recalled yesterday, at the Shirley.  That's near Waiting River, motherfucker.  It's near Mastic, by the way.  Shirley's more Mastic than Waiting River?  Yeah, it's all that area.  Mastic, not so good.  Shirley, all right.  Waiting River, better.  Some parts of Shirley, not very good.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the parts really right next to Mastic.  Am I right? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, better.  But Shirley, convenience store, he said, I'm sorry, I have a family, I have no money  for food, I have no job.  Are you believing this guy?  Nope, not for a second.  You really think maybe it's a guy that needs drugs or something and got caught and said,  fuck, I'm going to talk my way out of this?  I quite frankly don't give a shit what his situation is.  He came in, demands money as a badass, and if this poor fucking guy, like so many of these  convenience stores people just kind of stood there, he'd get his ass beat by a baseball 
[03:21:30]  bat while this savage just fucking didn't give a shit about hurting him or doing anything  or thinking about the consequences.  And then this motherfucker pulls a gun out and he's on his knees begging and praying.  That butt of that fucking rifle would have been right across the bridge of this cocksucker's  nose.  And he would have considered himself fucking lucky.  That's how you would have played it?  That's it.  That's right.  The unidentified masked bandit was not so contrite seconds earlier when a surveillance 
[03:22:00]  camera caught him waving a bat at Mohammed while demanding cash in the 1235 AM robbery.  I said, hold on, relax, said Mohammed, who was just about to close up shop.  Rather than empty the register, the 46-year-old Pakistani immigrant reached beneath the counter  and grabbed his licensed shotgun.  And some people say it's a 9mm rifle, some people say it's an M1 carbine.  Look, I'm looking at this picture, it's not a shotgun, first of all.  The picture that he's holding right there, that ain't a fucking shotgun. 
[03:22:30]  That's really not a shotgun?  Nope.  God, I'm stupid.  No, look at the sights.  I thought it was a shotgun, too.  The barrel isn't big enough, and the ejector.  That's a long gun.  The ejector is...  What's the difference between a long gun and a shotgun?  Long gun's a rifle.  Oh, is that a rifle?  No, this is a rifle.  A shotgun doesn't have...  That's a rifle?  A rifle has a rifled bore.  It spins the bullet.  A shotgun is just a smooth bore.  Ah. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  So...  Mars, go home.  It's not a...  It's not a shotgun.  That fucking guy has something there.  Yeah, it's a little carbine or something.  As Mohammed...  Or is it Sohal?  Yeah, Mohammed.  Came out to confront him.  The robber dropped the bat, fell to his knees, and folded his hands in prayer, the video  showed.  Well, the guy must have thought he was getting shot, so aren't you going to come up with  all sorts of shit at that moment?  Yep.  He begged for forgiveness and explained his dire situation at home. 
[03:23:30]  Mohammed against odds, longer than his daily lotto customers...  What?  Mohammed...  Oh, is he trying to throw in a convenience store analogy?  I guess.  All right, let me try this.  All right, here we go.  Mohammed, comma, against odds longer than his daily lotto customers face...  Listen to him...  What?  Mohammed, against odds longer than his daily customers face...  Oh, his daily customers face long odds to win lotto. 
[03:24:00]  Right.  I think that he could have wrote that a little better.  Listened and let him go.  I told him, promise me you'll never rob anybody again.  What happened?  Kenny was showing me, but he just...  He handed me this and he pointed at the guy holding the gun.  What happened, Kenny?  That's what you're talking about.  No, I don't...  No, but...  Kenny, we're looking...  We're looking on the other end of the, um...  I love Kenny. 
[03:24:30]  I don't even know...  I don't even know how half these people find their way to work.  That's no shotgun, right, Kenny?  No.  I was looking for the guy...  Where's the sentence that we were just talking about?  But he puts it, goes, this is what you're talking about.  Oh, you show me the front page of the paper, too.  Go away.  Go away!  That's...  Yeah, oh, okay, look at that.  See, now I'm looking at the front of the boar, which is Kenny.  No, the boar of the rifle.  That is not a shotgun.  Let me read the rest of this. 
[03:25:00]  So, uh...  What a shotgun, stupid people.  Same people that try to talk about fucking gun laws.  I told him, promise me you'll never rob anybody again, Muhammad said.  The robber quickly obliged.  Of course he's going to oblige.  There's a gun in his face.  No, I'm not going to promise you that.  The owner then pulled $40 from his till and told the man to grab a loaf of bread on the way out.  The instant...  The instantly rehabilitated thief thanked Muhammad, called him a good man, and disappeared into the night.  The whole thing was over in about two minutes.  I feel really good because I helped someone, Muhammad said yesterday. 
[03:25:30]  Everyone should help each other.  I did this because he had problems.  I don't call myself a hero.  If this guy's still going to be down on his luck, of course he's going to rob again.  Right?  Well, you know...  Yes!  Maybe.  That guy knows...  Depends on the guy.  First of all, the guy...  Not everything works out like trading places.  No, but the guy had a bat, not a gun.  So, which means that he's probably not that experienced a fucking robber.  You can rob with a bat, but most guys who are good at robbing convenience stores have a gun.  That could have been... 
[03:26:00]  It's probably a drug crime, though, more than anything.  Right.  Yeah.  I did this because he had problems.  I don't call myself a hero.  Muhammad called the police after the man fled from the store, but said he doesn't want to press charges.  The suspect's face is invisible on the tape, making his apprehension unlikely.  Wow, this guy got off.  Muhammad, who lives in Shirley with his wife and 17-year-old son, said he was never scared.  And with good reason, I have a gun.  He also had a lot of sympathy for the man blaming the economy for forcing good people into bad decisions.  How do you know?  Everybody should live the American dream, said Muhammad, who opened his business six months ago. 
[03:26:30]  Everyone should have a job so this doesn't happen again.  Well, let me explain something to you.  He's a nice man.  No, no.  He's a fucking idiot.  And let me explain why this guy's a fucking idiot.  This fucking thief should be run through the goddamn system.  Because now, let's just think about what might happen.  Let's say there's a week down the road.  We look at some surveillance.  Perhaps two weeks.  Perhaps two. 
[03:27:00]  We look at some surveillance footage of a brand new robbery that just happened in another store with a real familiar looking jacket and M.O. and everything else.  But this time, the guy's carrying maybe because he realized, hey, the fucking owner might have a gun.  So let me get one illegally, of course.  And then goes in and perhaps takes the life of another clerk, maybe a customer in the store or something else.  This fucking idiot made a decision where now he's endangering other people by letting this guy go. 
[03:27:30]  It's his decision that maybe the next guy isn't going to be as fucking lucky as he was to not get killed doing this?  No.  It's the law that is in place for that.  This guy should have been held at gunpoint until the cops came, arrest him, and run him through the fucking system.  So now this guy is going to, this Mohammed shithead is going to have it on his fucking conscience if he has one, that if somebody gets killed by this guy? 
[03:28:00]  I have to agree with you on this one.  Ah, fucking idiot.  I'm with you on this one, Ant.  I'm with you.  By the way, he owes $137,331 in back taxes.  Who?  The fucking owner of this store.  Yeah.  Why are you mad at him?  Because I pay my taxes!  And a boy, Ant.  So you're mad at everyone in the story?  Yeah.  Everyone. 
[03:28:30]  Everyone's an asshole.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Language.  Because I don't think the problem was solved.  No, it wasn't.  The guy's going to still be desperate if that's the true story.  Exactly.  And how's he going to get his money?  Well, I got $40 and a loaf of bread.  I'm set.  Let me buy a house.  He'll probably come back with all his friends.  Exactly.  We got an easy one.  He's like, yeah, we got an easy mark.  This guy will give you fucking money.  And we know exactly where his weapon is, what kind of weapon it is.  Yeah, but you're not going to go back knowing he has a gun.  But the paper today points out that it wasn't loaded.  So, sir, load your gun, you blithering idiot.  You know what?  You don't go back in. 
[03:29:00]  You go back in because you know he's got a gun.  And then you fucking know that you have to blindside him and smash his face in before  he gets to it.  This guy's an idiot.  Now, people will go to another store.  I'm a fan of loading guns.  If you're going to have a gun, load it.  Of course.  Especially if these kids are running.  And leave it laying around while the kids are playing.  Yes, of course.  They like to play with them.  Yes.  All right.  Take it upon yourself to maybe endanger someone else by letting this fucking criminal go.  No, you shouldn't. 
[03:29:30]  Good move.  Good move.  It's not a good move.  Oh.  Oh, can't hear the sarcasm, Jimmy.  Oh, I understand that, Anthony.  This is the new me, man.  From now on, man.  We're going to do a different kind of show.  Look at you with your sunglasses on.  I want to do my show with my sunglasses.  You look like a douche.  Ant is not getting the other side.  Ant sounds like Judge Dredd.  No, I don't.  I am the law.  Exactly.  What other side am I not getting?  It's Judge Judy. 
[03:30:00]  Did I talk to this idiot on Line 7?  No.  His name is this idiot.  What a coincidence.  Where is he?  CJ.  What are we talking about?  Ant is not getting the other side.  Of what?  Of the story about the guy with the gun.  He's on TV.  That guy?  That guy right there.  That guy.  That's the guy.  Same guy.  Same guy on TV.  Same guy.  Same guy.  Same guy.  King of comedy.  For real who?  Yeah, for real.  CJ. 
[03:30:30]  CJ.  Hi, CJ.  What side am I not getting?  Ant, I'm agreeing with you.  But the other side of the story is that what happens when all these other upstanding citizens  know that they can go and hijack a Mohamed store, and even if they get caught, they can  get 40 bucks and a loaf of bread out of it.  Well, I don't know how many he's going to actually let off.  This guy apparently drops to his knees and starts begging for his life and blurting out this probably  bullshit story.  You know, if other people want to go in there and try to rob him, hey, you know, good luck 
[03:31:00]  to you.  We should have.  But just the fact that this guy let that guy go, knowing he is a criminal, the fucking  guy came in, tried to rob him.  If he didn't have a gun, who knows?  He might have gotten his head beat in by that bat.  Or the guy might have had another weapon on him.  Who the fuck knows?  This guy might be a lawyer.  If I'm thinking about robbing a store, I'm going to go and rob his store.  Yeah, that's what we were saying, too.  Like, now you know he has a gun that he doesn't load.  That was the other side.  Have a good one.  Okay, see. 
[03:31:30]  It said Ant is not getting the other side.  What we should do is just have all our listeners go to that convenience store and go, look, I  just want to let you know right away, I don't have a weapon on me.  You can check me, but I'm down on my luck and see how many loaves of bread he would  give out before he's finally had it.  20 bucks on a loaf.  With being a good Samaritan.  Yeah.  He just starts shooting people coming in to buy shit.  Owner should have pulled a Tyler Durden.  Thank you.  Thank.  Thank.  Where he pulls him out back.  Puts the gun to his head.  Raymond K. Hassell. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  God damn it.  Do I have to see Fight Club again?  Sure do.  Motherfucker.  I'm down on my Fight Club references.  What did you want to be, Raymond?  Ah!  Now I'm in.  Visionary.  Visionary.  Now I'm in.  Animals.  Animals.  Store owner is facing murder charges for killing criminal?  Not that store owner.  No.  He didn't even take the loaf of bread.  Yeah.  Do you guys know that part of the story, by the way?  Oh, he didn't take the bread?  So if he needed to feed his family, why wouldn't he take the bread? 
[03:32:30]  Maybe they're watching their carbs.  Wait, what?  Maybe they're watching their carbs.  Jesus.  That's right.  Mr. Atkins was robbing the fucking store.  There's no one buying his dumb book anymore.  Because he's dead.  Exactly.  Obviously.  Hence, it hurts sales.  Yes.  He tried to promote it.  He just came out of coffin.  Obviously, he wasn't robbing for the Nagel family.  No, they would have just said, keep the money.  Give us the bread.  What?  What is that? 
[03:33:00]  What?  Is that the latest teacher?  God damn it.  Another teacher having sex?  Having sex with a student?  Yeah, hang on.  Let me get it.  This could be the hottest one yet.  No.  Favaravry.  Oh, yeah.  La Favaravry.  Favaravry.  Favaravry.  Favaravry.  Is this breaking news, Dan?  I think it's new.  God damn it.  Let's take a look.  Not as good as La Favaravry.  No, no, no.  But she's cute.  She's all right.  Yeah.  Wow.  What are the details?  All we need are grades.  It's not new?  No.  Oh, go fuck yourself. 
[03:33:30]  Dan, thanks for nothing.  Way to go.  Thanks for a big heaping bag of nothing.  Boy, those freaking instant feedbackers.  What was the grade?  It was a high school drama teacher.  Oh, okay.  Well, you could fuck them.  Yeah, they probably just doing Lolita or something.  Push that fucking failed actress over the piano and stick it in their shitter.  Fucking punker shitter.  Yeah.  Jimmy's right.  Gym teachers, failed athletes.  Yep.  Drama teachers, never made it with their acting. 
[03:34:00]  So why are they teaching you?  Because they could teach.  Music teachers, failed fucking singers, piano players, whatever they are.  What fucking music teacher would like to make $40,000 instead of selling hit records for millions and millions?  I'd rather pass on my gift.  Yeah, would you?  Every time, every music teacher who plays the piano, I want to just slam that little thing down on their fingers.  Whatever it's called, the thing that covers the keys.  The key cover.  Yes, I want to mash that down on their fucking fingers. 
[03:34:30]  I fucking hate this oatmeal.  You don't like that oatmeal?  God damn it, fucking fuck.  It's a bunch of crap.  Have a little fruit in there.  I tried.  Yes.  Here we go.  I've had a big fruit.  25 kid shows that must have been created by adults on drugs.  All right, let's go.  Who wants to start?  Uncle Paul?  I'm going to guess Sesame Street.  I don't know.  That's pretty popular there, Uncle Paul.  It was probably in there.  These are fucking weird kid shows where you go, man, somebody was on something. 
[03:35:00]  It's got to be Teletubbies.  I'm giving myself a bell right away.  Are you looking at the list, Dan?  No.  All right.  Where do you?  Teletubbies is number nine.  The Magic God.  Number nine.  Oh, look at that.  Let it be known that we're doing extra radio for this fucking company right now.  I thought you were going to go, let it be known, we're ending the show.  No, we'll do a little extra for you.  The Magic God.  Because we feel like doing extra.  Magic God.  Magic God, Gregory.  Teletubbies.  No, let's start with Teletubbies.  Okay. 
[03:35:30]  Teletubbies.  Why is Teletubbies a show that had to be created by adults on drugs?  Well, according to this list, it says, never mind the controversy over whether Tinky Winky  pushed a gay rights agenda.  The real question surrounding the popular British show Teletubbies is whether its creators were  totally baked.  Set in a seemingly idyllic, technologically advanced happy land, Teletubby, wow, eschews niceties  like story and character in favor of twinkly music and endless shots of fuzzy child beasts  romping and muttering in some kind of giggly moon language. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  And just when the haziness seems about to be clear, the little freaklets coo again and  start the trip all over again.  See?  Let's be honest.  They've got televisions in their stomachs.  Let's be honest.  Do we really want to do this?  No.  Not really.  The Wiggles?  Let's go Wiggles.  No Wiggles.  I don't know who they are.  I said Magic Garden.  No Magic Garden.  What the fuck?  They're newer.  How about we do it until we get number one, then we go on. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  Blue's Clues.  Blue's Clues?  Nope.  This fucking game sucks.  Number one.  Electric Company.  No, of course not.  Zoom.  Nah, why would it be there?  Why Electric Company, Jimmy?  What's that?  Why that?  Because.  Fucking, um.  Number three on the list.  Why don't you hit that bell for yourself?  Why the Electric Company, Dan?  Well, no show better embodies the psychedelic elements of the 70s than the Electric Company.  I say Mr. Rogers, because it's a guy walking around in a fantasy land by himself, talking 
[03:37:00]  to King Friday.  Stupid King Friday.  I hated King Friday.  I always wanted King Friday to be caught in some sort of an online child porn scandal.  It was winter, spring, summer, fall.  Even a, that was her name?  I think so.  Ugh.  Even as a kid, I knew he was a creep.  Speedy delivery!  Speedy delivery!  Oh yeah, Mr. McFeely.  Coming too soon.  Oops!  Speedy delivery!  Yes.  Here's your package from Thailand.  Here's those photos. 
[03:37:30]  Thank you, Mr. McFeely.  Yes.  Yeah, that, like, creepy, always smiling, kind of.  That show creeped me out.  Always.  He'd change his sweater and put the shoes on.  Why would you change your sweater out?  Hairless lady, boys.  Keep the fucking DNA off of it.  Okay.  Even as a kid, I remember, like, him taking his shoes off being very creepy.  Like, why would you take the shoes off on television?  I was creeped out by the show.  And why did he put the sweater on?  Because it was time to have fun?  Yeah.  Or did he take the sweater off and then put it back on when he was done?  I forget now, Ant.  He, uh...  Did he come in with his...  He took the businessman's shit off and put on his sweater. 
[03:38:00]  Because sweater says fun?  Sweater, yeah, button-up sweater thing.  It was more relaxed.  You got the kids relaxed before he gave them Zimas and fucking condoms.  Before you attempt to stick a pinky in their...  Little digit.  ...anus.  Why the electric company, Bill?  Always start with the pinky.  Because, let's see, they used an early analog computer animation system that allowed people  to walk out of hand-drawn doors, dance with animated, uh, consonant clusters,  or sing with two differently costumed versions of themselves. 
[03:38:30]  Wow, that must have looked great back then.  Sure looked very realistic.  Green clouds and exploding stars set to raw wah-wah funk were a staple,  as were cameos by Spider-Man, who communicated via speech bubbles.  Jesus.  Sounds stupid.  All right, we're still looking for number one.  25 kids shows that must have been created by adults on drugs.  Cat and Kangaroo.  Holy shit, Jimmy, no.  No.  Pee-wee's Playhouse. 
[03:39:00]  You know what to do.  Number four.  Son of a bitch.  That's pretty good, though.  We got two out of the top five.  It's like being punished.  You can't leave the table until you finish your dinner.  Don't look at the phones.  Kids shows.  Kids shows, number one.  Number one kids show.  Is this something we would know?  Correctamundo.  All right.  All righty. 
[03:39:30]  How about the show?  Oh, I know what it is.  All right.  Mr. McGregor's paint shop.  No, it's not that.  It's the time they spilt the paint.  Sure.  Is that one of the greatest bits since moving to satellite radio?  Fucking rules.  HR pumping stuff.  You just wanted to go home.  No, I...  You looked.  No, no, no.  I saw you look at the screen, make believe you're rubbing your nose.  I wouldn't have said that.  I wouldn't have said that from reading it.  What got me was, I wouldn't have...  By reading it, which meant you did read it. 
[03:40:00]  No, no.  I did.  Well, it's right in front of me.  But, but, I gotta be honest with you.  I thought it was newer shows.  I would have said that first.  Why first?  I would have said, because it's the most fucked up show ever.  It was creepy, right?  It's stupid.  The stupid magic flute.  Is that the one with Sigmund?  The witchy poo and the stupid English kid.  Was Sigmund in that one?  Sigmund was a spinoff.  Another Sid and Marty Kropp piece of shit.  Wait, so he wasn't in HR?  No.  And then I thought they spun off it from HR.  HR pumping stuff. 
[03:40:30]  He's your friend when things get rough.  Huh.  See, and he looked like Mayor McCheese.  Right.  He had the big head and everything.  Witchy poo scared the shit out of me as a kid.  Witchy poo was the one that was always after the kid's magic flute.  What was his name?  Was that little faggot?  I really don't.  Kid's name.  There's witchy pooch.  Dan, why HR puff and stuff according to the.  It's like a motorized broom.  You know, it's pretty much nailing it, but.  Jimmy.  Jimmy was the kid, right?  A little annoying kid.  No.  With his magic flute.  He was the sweet boy with the magic flute. 
[03:41:00]  Hated him.  Hootie loo.  Was Land of the Lost another Croft show?  Ooh.  I was watching that recently.  I was torturing my girlfriend, making her watch him.  Horrid.  It's fucking her.  That guy with his fucking Jamie Gillis porno hairdo.  The fucking.  The guy who was the father.  The father.  Yeah.  That was.  And I can't describe to you how badly I hate Chaka.  Chaka is unwatchable.  He was a.  What was he?  A.  A.  A.  A Pakuli. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  A Pakuli.  Or something like that.  Or a Pakani.  I don't know.  And then they had those.  Sleece stacks.  Sleece stacks.  Right.  It was so bad.  Chaka.  Number two on the list.  That was.  Devil's Creek.  Ooh.  No.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, look at Stimpin.  Chaka.  You puzzled Chaka.  You ass.  What was he?  A Pakani or a Pakuni?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm just pulling up pictures now.  You know that we're not.  We were supposed to have a meeting because the guy that was in charge of the meeting took 
[03:42:00]  a personal day today.  And that same guy is now walking down the hall.  Oh, shit.  Can they ever.  See, I knew we should have gotten out of here.  Well, I've now made new plans, though.  So I can't have a meeting.  He ain't walking in here to meet with us.  Now I've had a meeting.  Hey, why Puffin?  You don't want to meet with Laverne DeFazio's father?  Why Puffin Stuff?  I have a meeting with a big ragu.  Creepy flavor saver under his nose. 
[03:42:30]  Although Puffin Stuff was never meant to be pro-pot or pro-psychedelics, it's not hard  to perceive a lesergic tinge to the show's ongoing saga of a kid lured by a talking flute  to a land of witches and rampant anthropomorphism.  Whatever the fuck that means.  It's, um, what did you say?  The word?  Anthropomorphism.  Okay.  I'm assuming.  I don't know.  It's got po in it, so it's got to be good.  Well, Travis beat you to it in my ear.  Damn it. 
[03:43:00]  In your rear?  No, my ear.  Oh, I heard wrong.  In my ear.  I heard in my ass.  What the hell is that?  I guess that would be like talking plants or something?  Anthropomorphism.  I gave you guys, by the way, folders of your pictures.  Did you get them?  No.  What do you mean?  You emailed them?  No, I fucking gave you the disc.  Give me this.  Give me this.  Don't call me.  I'll give me this.  I didn't get no fucking this.  Jimmy Norton, give me that.  No disc for me.  I got that.  Nope.  No, I didn't. 
[03:43:30]  Anthropomorphism is giving uniquely human characteristics to non-human creatures.  Creatures.  Like E-Rock.  We're out of here.  Anthropomorphism.  It was fun.  Yes!  And it's going to be even more fun when we do it all again for you, for you, tomorrow.  Big guests tomorrow.  Who?  I don't know.  What info will we get wrong tomorrow?  I'm sure the names.  Yeah.  That was pretty funny though, Jimmy.  I love that. 
[03:44:00]  I'm sure of it.  All right, I got it.  This is just a tease.  Because I can't help myself.  Kenny's mashup demo.  There's ten tracks.  Just a tease.  Psychedelic.  Hey, it's me, Crazy Kenny, king of the morning mashup.  I want to start off by kissing Kid Kelly's ass.  He's the boss of the mashup. 
[03:44:30]  So I want to dedicate a song to all you metrosexuals out there.  Here's the Jonas Brothers with Paranoid.  One criticism.  You should have said kissing Kid Kelly's keister.  No, I'm saying for the flow of the K words, for the sound.  That's all.  As opposed to kissing Kid Kelly's ass, you should have said kissing Kid Kelly's keister.  Because you were making the K sound through a lot of stuff.  I'll take that back. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, because I was just saying as a flow thing.  It was serious criticism.  No, he's right.  That's why he's a great comedian.  I don't like Kenny's fucking shoe-sneaker combination.  What does he got going on?  I don't know.  Those giant fucking...  Let me see.  Those stupid hybrid boats on his feet.  Oh, they're like black sneakers that are supposed to look like shoes?  They're fucking sneaker shoes.  They're awful.  They're the type of things that giants have to wear when they wear suits.  Because they don't make proper shoes. 
[03:45:30]  Even in a tux, you'd have to wear those fucking awful, dull, no-reflective shoes.  But he's got a horrible...  Holy shit.  He just hands you a great compliment and you bash him.  I'm not bashing him.  Bashing his shoes.  It's fucking awful.  He's got to be quick on his feet.  He's got work boot laces in his fucking dress shoes.  Sickens me.  Oh, those big lug shoes.  Can we lug out of here?  Yes.  Those are going to loot.  Those are awful.  All right.  Let us tear. 
[03:46:00]  Look, when all the mics go off, then the show has to.  The show's over.  It has.  All right.  Who's out first?  Take it in.  Oh, Danny's out first.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy's out.  Here you are.  Ant-Nine.  I'm done.  Put the guest mics on so they can still hear us now. </pre>
