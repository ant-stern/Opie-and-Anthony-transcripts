<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Jimmy Norton relating a disastrous experience with a Craigslist escort service.  He ordered a 5'11" blonde, but received a much shorter woman who didn't resemble the ad photo.  Norton rejected her, sparking a discussion about the deceptive practices of such agencies, including a detailed examination of the escort's Craigslist ad.  Norton remained in studio throughout the broadcast.

The conversation then segued to Opie's underwater brawl with a French scuba diver, stemming from repeated accidental collisions. Opie recounted punching the diver, which escalated into a grappling match before being broken up by their dive guide.

This led to a discussion of a news report about a male nurse who sexually assaulted a terminally ill patient.  The hosts and Norton discussed the perceived creepiness of male nurses, transitioning into a letter to an advice columnist detailing a barber's inappropriate touching of a client.  The barbershop scenario and Opie's underwater fight were revisited briefly.

A significant portion of the show focused on humorous anecdotes and caller accounts of uncomfortable experiences with male hairdressers, often involving unwanted physical contact.  The hosts debated the preference for female hairdressers.  Bob Kelly’s experience with a gay masseuse was also playfully teased out, with Kelly offering vague explanations.  One caller described a barber who made him read a dirty magazine, while another recounted receiving an unwanted hand massage.

A lengthy and humorous bit followed, documenting the difficulties in recording a promotional announcement with the Iron Sheik, characterized by rambling and incoherent responses. Similar challenges were experienced with wrestler Jimmy Superfly Snooker.

The death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was discussed, interspersed with darkly comedic commentary and jokes about the 70 virgins promised to Muslim martyrs in the afterlife. Listener calls on the topic were taken, and a humorous promotional bit mimicking the 70 virgins promise was included.  This "70 virgins" theme continued, with numerous listener calls and crude, sexually suggestive humor regarding the "re-virginization" of the virgins.

The broadcast then shifted to the awkward situation involving Earl, who unsuccessfully tried to invite Nadine to Eddie Trunk's wedding. Nadine’s insistence on bringing her boyfriend led to escalating tension, culminating in Earl throwing an object at Ben, damaging a studio microphone.  Eddie Trunk called in to give his perspective, and Nadine was brought into the studio, further escalating the awkwardness. Pete Johnson, a studio technician, had to repair the damaged microphone.

Finally, the hosts briefly commented on a QVC broadcast they watched, specifically focusing on a man's enthusiastic sales pitch for a baseball card box set, highlighting valuable rookie cards such as a Maguire card.

[00:03:00]  It's the O.P. 
[00:03:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things. 
[00:04:00]  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things they might happen.  Some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of O.P.  And you're listening to the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  It's the O.P. and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Jimmy Norton in studio, of course.  Yes.  And he was just casually telling us as we went to break that you turned away a lady of the evening last night. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, my first escort that I actually sent away.  Sent away.  You told her to leave.  I've never done it before.  I wouldn't have thought you would have.  You're the kind of guy that no matter what, you've had some nightmare stories where women have come to the door and maybe not been very attractive, very young.  And you invite them in and they do what they're being paid to do. 
[00:05:00]  That's why I take a face full of humiliation.  This one, I was on Craig's last night and I just had a, I got bitten.  Oh, no.  I got bitten by the lonely bug.  Yeah.  I wanted some company.  You're trolling around.  Yeah, and I found one.  And you found one.  Pretty 5'11 blonde.  What's the description?  Okay.  5'11 blonde.  5'11 blonde.  It's a picture, really beautiful.  5'11 right there would scare me away thinking, dude.  No, no, not the picture I saw.  No way. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Just a tall, like, model type girl.  Okay, blonde.  Yeah.  And that was all I cared about.  That sounds good.  Yeah, really.  How about the body?  Slender?  Very.  Like 115.  You saw pictures?  Yes.  Big upper half?  No.  No, no.  Breast not too large.  Waist trim.  Nothing major.  Just a small girl.  And how old?  Don't remember.  Mid-20s, early-20s.  The face was bleeped out.  That's why.  They blocked the face out.  But the body, if you look at it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  But I can show you where the picture is.  Yeah, but I'm just saying if the face was fuzzed out. 
[00:06:00]  I'm just picturing it.  That sounds like something that's pretty good.  A butter face?  No, no.  A lot of times they won't show you the face, so I called the agency.  Wait.  Can we guess why you turned her away?  Okay.  Leprosy.  No?  No.  And I can't share a cigar with her.  So, wait.  I wasn't paying attention because I was doing something.  Where did you find this girl?  What were you doing?  I was actually looking at sports scores.  There you go, Jimmy.  There's your story. 
[00:06:30]  I set you up and then I was like, all right, let's make sure we talk about Roger Clemens  signing with the Astros, supposedly, and Sabres forcing a Game 7.  All right, Jimmy is handing me this.  I was showing Anthony.  Just look it up in the search thing when you get there.  No, where did you find her?  She was on Craigslist.  Oh, okay, okay.  And I was...  So, 5'11 blonde and she sent a picture, but her face was...  She didn't send it.  The picture was actually in the ad and I called.  It was an agency.  And I just...  I hate the agencies.  They're all such lying scumbags. 
[00:07:00]  All right, I know what happened.  And are you going to guess?  Uh, search, choose type.  No, no, no.  What am I looking for?  Um, oh, New York.  Right, right.  And then I go down to where?  The, um, personal...  Lower, lower.  Services.  Erotic.  Erotic services.  And I click that.  Look up that name.  Don't say it.  Keyword?  Yep, look up that name and I'll tell you if I see one. 
[00:07:30]  Okay, let's see.  Before we give it out on the air.  Yeah.  I don't even know if we should give it out on the air.  I don't even want to give it out on the air.  Yeah.  Does this end with an H?  Yes, it does.  Your penmanship is horrid.  I was busy.  I'm talking on a radio show.  Okay, which one?  Which one?  Oh, hold on.  Which one?  R right there?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  That's it?  That's it.  All right, let me tell you something.  So you got a picture of her at?  She's smoking. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, she's in a bikini.  God damn it, now I have to.  Go look, Opie.  I'll take care of things while you're gone.  Her face is blurred away.  But you don't care, right?  But you don't care.  What is she, a burn victim?  There's nothing there that's going to be bad.  That's smoking.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's really hot.  Too fitty.  Do you like tall, leggy, waif-type blondes?  I'm nodding yes for people at home.  Then I am the answer to your prayers.  My name is Travis. 
[00:08:30]  She looks like a real treat.  She looks like, I don't know, a 9 or a 10.  I'm 5'11", natural blonde with an incredibly slim body of just 112 pounds, of course.  Perfectly toned with a gorgeous face.  I am upscale and take care of men in the same manner.  I am yours for the asking.  Pleasure beyond your wildest imagination. 
[00:09:00]  Believe me, some guys can really imagine pretty wild.  You can't, we can.  You'd leave with no head.  Wait till she walks in and she's, wait, I didn't know your wildest imagination included tape and a buzzsaw.  I want to chop you up, put your body parts in cement, and dump them in the harbor.  You shouldn't have ripped that lady.  Indulge tonight.  You will thank yourself in the morning.  See her tonight.  No, it's not okay to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  Yeah, because some people, hey, I want to represent you.  There's a number there.  I'm going to make you a star.  How much, Jimmy?  $2.50.  $2.50?  $2.50 for how long?  An hour.  All right, I'm writing all of this down.  And you turned her away.  $2.50 an hour.  Yes.  I know exactly why.  I'm so out of this.  Let's try to guess why Jimmy turned away.  Because as I'm looking, let me, let me, $10, I got it.  All right, what?  You guess first.  You guess first.  I'll write down what I'm, just in case, so, you know. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Just in case you get the same thing.  I'm looking.  Now, the face is blurred out.  Like I said, I want to ask Jimmy a question, but I don't want to blow it.  I think it's really obvious.  Does it have, did it have something to do with her face?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Kind of.  Kind of.  Kind of.  I didn't want to, kind of.  E-Rock, do you have a guess?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Ovi's got an answer.  I want an answer.  I am very confident with my answer. 
[00:10:30]  The old bait and switch.  That's exactly what it was.  Bait and switch.  So obvious.  Because if this girl's showing up in your, if this girl's showing up in your door, you're  not going to have a problem with her.  Not even.  Even if she's missing an eye, an ear, you know, whatever damage.  I was thinking, yeah, teeth are out.  Whatever damage that Fuzzy is covering up, you're not, you're not, you know, telling  her to go home.  Not even if she had an added appendage.  You just take it like a man.  What if it's like pit bull attack and it ripped half her face off and she's waiting for a face 
[00:11:00]  transplant?  You put the sheet over her head and just.  Doesn't matter.  Who cares?  I say a completely different girl showed up at the door.  What did she look like, Jimmy?  What happened?  Here's the way I can describe her.  She was just, she had a sweet disposition and she looked like the Hawaiian version of  Natalie from the Facts of Life.  Oh my God.  It wasn't even close?  It wasn't even.  And his 5'11 and the girl walked in, she had heels and I'm like, well, she's a little,  little bigger than the other girl. 
[00:11:30]  So I didn't remember the picture.  And then she stepped out of her heels and I was like, yeah.  And she went.  It was like an accordion.  She just called.  Well, what the hell did you say?  She stepped out of her shoes.  5'11", 5'10", 5'9", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6", 5'6".  She's going down.  I'm two and a half.  She jumped off her stilts.  Right.  And at first I was just.  That's a model is what it comes down to.  Yeah.  I was going to be the good guy.  I brought her to my bedroom because I had candles lit.  And.  Of course you did.  You think this hottie's coming over. 
[00:12:00]  Then you go, follow me.  Fatty.  No, she wasn't really that fat.  Like if I met her somewhere, like anywhere, I would sleep with her.  But it wasn't what I want.  I'm the customer.  Yeah.  So I said, I brought her in my room and I just got angry at the woman who I talked to on the phone.  Because I was going to go to bed.  I have to get up.  This is like 12 o'clock at night.  So I'm like, look, I got to get up in the morning.  I got to be responsible.  I can't be hooking past one.  So I'm like, maybe I'll call you tomorrow.  And the lady's like, no, no, no.  She'll be there in 20 minutes.  I'm like, she will?  She's like, yes. 
[00:12:30]  So the girl came 20 minutes later, but it wasn't the one I wanted.  Yeah.  So I told the girl, like, look, you're really sweet.  The agency, she told me what her name was.  I'm like, oh, you don't know the name.  She's like, no.  And I'm like, I know that's not you.  Oh, so they didn't even, she didn't even try to say her name.  She knew it wasn't.  She knew it that I knew.  And she was nice.  She wasn't a liar.  And so I call the agency.  And this scumbag woman who answers the phone, I don't know what I expected, like a woman of integrity and fine measure.  Sending other girls out to prostitute themselves for drug money. 
[00:13:00]  You know, I'm expecting, you know, a business integrity.  I'll call the Better Business Bureau on you.  Well.  Well, let me tell you.  There's been a mix-up.  That's right.  Mr. Norton, we do apologize.  Let me talk to customer service.  I didn't get to dehumanize and humiliate the person I ordered.  I mean, there really is no.  Hello, my name is Rob.  What is your problem, customer service?  If you've been bait and switched, press one.  If it's a man, press two.  So I said, look, I said nothing. 
[00:13:30]  I was really nice to her because I wasn't mad at her.  If I had met her in a different circumstance, I was more annoyed at the agency and I wanted them to get nothing than I was at her.  So I slipped her a little something just for coming.  She knew what happened.  Hawaiian Natalie is all I'm thinking.  And I would be so annoyed at her, the company.  I wouldn't call her sweet and say I'm sorry about the mix-up.  It would be get out, fatty.  No, she was nice, dude.  I have candles lit in here.  Old lamp oil blubber legs. 
[00:14:00]  She was okay.  Hey, Judy Blum novel cover.  Come here.  How much worse was she?  Again, it was more like from, say, a nine and a half down to like a six and a half.  But it was more, I was so angry.  I called the agency.  Well, she goes out under that name.  I'm like, look, sweetheart.  Pretty much.  When you're expecting this coming to the door.  And you get that.  Yeah.  And I even said, it's the girl in the picture, right?  And she's like, yeah, who's coming?  So when I called, she knew I knew. 
[00:14:30]  I'm like, look, we both know what just happened.  She's like, well, no, she goes out.  I'm like, look, I'm not stupid.  I've dated.  It is the girl in the picture.  It's the tarp she's laying on.  That's the clothing.  It's the funhouse mirror image of the girl in the picture.  It's the girl in the picture on Jupiter.  I was very hot.  Believe me, I'm tempted to throw this company under the bus.  And believe me, the phone will ring.  Yeah.  The phone will really ring.  So eventually, I'm sure that.  Well, the pests need a mission.  They've been just hanging low lately, the ONA pests. 
[00:15:00]  Well, I'm sure they'll get one in PalTalk.  That is really nasty.  Yeah, man.  They baited this scumbag.  How bummed were you?  I was.  Were you running around your apartment all excited because you saw the picture of this obvious Russian model?  Well, and then this thing shows up at your door.  What's wrong?  This is not.  Who got my coffee?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Coffee diva.  No, no, no, no.  Coffee diva's at it again.  This is going to be a problem.  Oh, no.  He doesn't like his coffee. 
[00:15:30]  And one of the interns are now going to pay with his very life.  Who put half and half of my coffee?  Who put half and half in there?  Yes, it is.  Who put half in there?  Yes, it is.  And then they're telling you, no, it isn't?  I know it has.  Oh, my God.  Don't tell him no.  He's 37.  How old are you, Mr. Half and Half?  If you say it's half and half, it is half and half.  No, definitely.  I can taste it.  Let me see.  It's not.  Like you, white and black, you're half and half.  Exactly.  You just naturally picked it up and bonded with it.  Tries to make it as light as possible.  Yeah, can I please have a medium coffee? 
[00:16:00]  He scrubs his skin at night just trying to scrub that black away, that little black that  he can, that only he could see in the mirror.  Trying to catch vitiligo.  Skim milk with one sugar.  Thank you very much.  The milk must be as pale as you.  That's right.  Skim.  Just think of yourself.  Slender milk.  Sam's getting killed today.  Well, Sam should get killed in his mad magazine feet.  His feet point out at right angles.  How bad are your arches?  He's pigeon-toed also or whatever that's called.  No, they point out the other way. 
[00:16:30]  His feet are ragingly awful.  Guilty Spark writes on the Instant Feedback, don't blow by Jim's Judy Blume novel cover  line.  It was a good line.  Thank you.  What are we supposed to do about it?  An applause break?  Have a party?  20 minutes of improv on the Judy Blume novel line?  Are you there, God?  It's me, fake hooker.  So, Jimmy, now I know you pretty well.  Now, she went home and you got the addiction in your head.  It's happening.  Yeah, you're all worked up.  You're all worked up. 
[00:17:00]  Froth.  You're lathering.  So, what did you do?  Pal talk.  You just went to Pal talk?  I went to online video conferencing for some sexual satisfaction.  So, did you punish one of our fans?  Well, no.  Did you punish one of our fans?  I just kind of watched.  Because they sent the wrong hooker over?  I punished myself.  Do you go to the Opie and Anthony fan rooms to find girls?  Or do you go to some of the smutty rooms?  Usually, I'll bounce around in smutty rooms.  Sometimes, fan rooms. 
[00:17:30]  But a lot of the other girls, they all know me.  So, they're not going to do.  They know you, yeah.  What are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  I don't know.  Nothing.  Nothing?  No.  Are you showing on Pal talk?  I have, but it's rare.  So, they're showing and then you do your thing?  I don't care.  So, did you go to, like, girls showing for guys?  One of those?  I just posted.  There's 250 people in the room.  Yeah, because a lot of times you're watching a porn video or whatever.  Yeah.  That type stuff.  You can't tell if it's live.  I think it's hotter if it's live.  Oh, my God.  Than if it's just some porno clip that they're playing. 
[00:18:00]  And, uh, yeah.  It's just some girl abusing herself.  That's pretty good.  But, yeah, you can't be mean to the girl.  It's just not nice.  You did that, huh?  I was very, she was sweet, man.  She wasn't, she did nothing.  She was like, Mr. Hanalei, she did nothing wrong.  You must have just had to throw your computer away.  Did she put on her high heels and have to take the long walk down your hallway all bummed  out?  She did, but I.  You didn't want her.  I tossed her a little something for guests.  You tossed her money.  I did. 
[00:18:30]  You are a sap, man.  No, no, no.  You're a sap.  Dude, she and I were victims of the same situation, man.  Man.  Those agencies, most of them are such scumbags.  Knock on the door.  Here she is.  Oh, no.  I know.  She ate the tiki.  No, because.  Oh, no.  That's not the one from the ad.  We had Jason on yesterday in an interview that did not go the way we wanted it to, because  we loved Jason, to be honest with you.  That's a call from Rikers.  It would have been a great interview, but Jay Moore decided at that moment to get completely 
[00:19:00]  naked in the dunking booth and jump on Bobby, who plays the no homo game we've discussed  on this show.  Well, Jay also, we told him later, he didn't know that we really liked Jason.  Jay Moore had no idea.  He just, unfortunately, had bad time with his bitch.  So, when you go to a place like that, where you're spending real money, I mean, you're  getting the person that you want.  If you're looking on the web for the person, that's the person you're going to get.  Yeah.  And I'm looking right now at a baby with an arm in the middle of its chest. 
[00:19:30]  I'm just looking at a three-armed baby on the news from some faraway Asian land.  Do you fix that, or do you sign him up for every sport that exists?  It's like, that is fantastic.  It is three perfect little baby arms.  How perfect?  You can play sports and hold your pocketbook at the same time.  Get the audio of that.  You have to leave it.  Why do you take the arm off?  I don't care.  As long as he's healthy.  As long as he's got 10 toes and 15 fingers. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, no, he's a mess.  Oh, what is that hand?  Oh, this kid's a mess.  Oh, boy.  You could still use it for something.  Like what?  I don't know.  You could catch your own pitches if you're batting.  The one arm is always in the, oh, like when you take your, oh, drat, when you make a fist.  You make a fist and kind of swing it in front of you and go, oh, that's how the baby's arm is.  Two regular arms.  And there's one that looks like little weird fingers.  Yeah, like stubby fingers.  At a show, you can clap while still eating popcorn. 
[00:20:30]  That's right.  There's some very handy things.  I'm applauding and eating a jalapeno popper at the same time.  Top of that.  Except the one arm's in the middle of the chest, so the jalapeno is being snuck under the shirt and then up through the collar into the mouth.  It's just creepy.  We should get into a discussion on freaks after the break.  Oh.  The two little girls have probably grown by now.  I'm sure they are.  It was a two-headed girl.  Two-headed girl.  She really was connected like one single body right up to the shoulders. 
[00:21:00]  Then the shoulders got a little wide, but there was still just two arms.  Two arms, two legs, one you-know-what.  And two heads.  And two heads.  Two heads.  So we had a fine discussion about that.  With two independently thinking brains.  Yeah.  One body.  How do you live?  Dude, how do you use a restroom?  How do you use a restroom?  How do you have sex and get married and have a relationship with somebody when you're sharing the goods? 
[00:21:30]  You've got to pencil it in on a little scheduler.  I don't like black guys, but I do.  Yeah, then there's the whole thing of what-  You're wrecking our merchandise.  The guys would get all jealous.  Right.  Like you're with the same bottom part.  It doesn't matter which face you're kissing.  You're rubbing, and then there's the other guy laying next, and he's the husband also.  What is it?  You split into like, you rub the right leg, I'll rub the left, and if you rub the left, you're cheating. 
[00:22:00]  But they show this thing like riding a bike and swimming.  It was a thing.  The freakish.  What else are you going to call it?  It was really, really creepy.  What do you do if you're having sex, though, and you get the ugly one?  What if the ugly head likes you?  What do you do?  You have to like, pretend you're not looking at the cute sister who's three inches away?  You're just trying to have a good time, and you have to go, turn your head, stupid.  And then what happens if you want to roll her over?  Do the guys have to switch sides of the bed?  You'd have to, because the head is on the other side now. 
[00:22:30]  I'm sure the guys aren't there together.  Well, and then-  Why not?  It's just too creepy.  It'd have to be.  You want to sleep with your wife?  And then there's two others that just make us laugh.  The older women now that were joined at the head.  That one wanted to be a country singer.  That is one of the best stories ever.  Yeah, one wanted to be a country singer, and the other one was condemned to lie on a gurney.  Like, they had to figure it out when they were kids.  I think the one that was on the gurney wanted to be the country singer, by the way. 
[00:23:00]  Really?  Yeah.  And the other one wanted to be just a regular gal, and the country singer, you know, because  she's in showbiz, had to have her side of her head dyed.  Yeah, they were connected by the top side, kind of, of their head.  It's one of the greatest stories ever.  By the top of their head.  So one of them had to lean over sideways, and the other one was on a gurney.  Right.  And the other one got highlights, because she's a country western singer.  Yeah, so they had to look good on stage.  Like those houses in Queens that are connected, and the shingles are different colors. 
[00:23:30]  It's like, that's how their hair was.  One wanted red hair, and the other wanted brown, so they picked a dividing line and dyed  the hair to different colors.  And one had longer hair than the other.  Yeah.  Even though they're pretty much sharing a skull.  Yeah.  An oversized skull.  What do you tell the hairdresser after you walk in, and she goes,  Ah!  Ah!  Okay.  I want half of mine, Reg.  Oh, Lord!  Won't you buy me a backbone that bends? 
[00:24:00]  They had to decide at some age which one was going to get the gurney, and which one had  to bend over sideways for the rest of her life.  And then the other girl has no desire to be in these smoky bars as her sister is trying  out a country western career, and has to go to all the gigs, obviously.  And she just sits on stage while the other one is singing.  Oh.  She's bored.  She's heard these songs before.  A million times.  Bar-na-na-na-na-na.  Stand by your thing.  Give him high hills to head to. 
[00:24:30]  I'm trying to go with achy-brakey myself here.  Achy-brakey skull.  Dreaming of an achy-brakey skull.  I can't get enough.  When that crap is on Discovery and all that.  Oh, I know.  TLC is the new freak show channel. 
[00:25:00]  And then the other one, the brothers, I think they're in Chicago.  Yeah, these are another pair that were just fantastic.  They were connected.  They have four legs.  Yeah, they were connected at the torso.  Yeah.  But I think, did they have four arms or just two arms?  I think they had four arms, but two that pretty much worked, and the other two just kind  of hung awkwardly.  So they were kind of separate at the legs.  They came together at the torso and then split apart again as they got to the heads. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  So they definitely had four legs.  Two heads, definitely four legs, and they were playing baseball.  They liked to play baseball, and their normal brother would pitch to them, and one would  be the catcher and one would be the batter, and then he would hit the ball, but he would  always be out because the catcher would either hold them back or tag them out.  Yeah, once you're the catcher, if the catcher's attached to you, it's sort of detrimental to  your game.  They would actually, remember the Asian brothers, Aang and whatever, the other guys, the famous 
[00:26:00]  Siamese twins?  Heap.  The way they would work is they got married to two different women.  They both had families.  They would stay with one family for like three days and the other family for four days.  They would split their time between the two homes.  Yeah.  That was how it worked instead of all being in one big, disgusting, incestuous, creepy  house.  Do you realize those two were only connected by a very thin skin on the chest?  They stayed together and made their clothing look like they were really together.  Yeah, all they had was an inch or two.  That was it.  Yeah.  They could have been separated. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Why weren't they?  Because they made a lot of money being like a Siamese twin freak show.  Oh, that wasn't a fear that they would bleed to death?  No, no.  Well, I don't think they had the medical advances either.  I think it was very risky even for that.  I don't think they shared anything like organ-wise.  Yeah.  I think it was very minimal.  For the time, I think it was still risky surgery, but it could have been done, they said.  Yeah.  You know, I would have just separated and then just like, all right, look, for the  act, we'll make believe we're still together.  Yeah, just make believe.  Who's going to know?  Did they have two arms and two legs each?  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.  How awkward.  Got to look at that dumb face forever.  They made a bloody fortune for themselves and their extended family.  I'd rather be broke.  Yeah, and be able to walk around without somebody next to you all the time.  What do you want to do if you make a lot of money?  Get this creep cut off you.  It's the only reason to earn money.  She cannot look at that dumb face, which looks exactly like yours.  Mama, don't let your babies grow up to wreck photos.  That's from Flying Standby and then Booby Man from Brooklyn. 
[00:27:30]  Jesus, take the wheel and this mess connected to me.  That's a Carrie Underwood country song, everybody.  It certainly is.  What else?  There's a million coming in now.  Do you think the ugly head tries harder?  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Don't split my skull.  My achy break the skull.  There it is.  Darn it. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  We should have came up with that one.  Very good.  I didn't have to break the skull.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, but he had to do it.  He put it in song form, Jimmy.  I don't like it.  He cheated.  Rude Dog from Arizona.  Hey, yeah, I just want to get back to Jimmy's hooker story.  Yeah.  How does that work?  Like, man, I want some of that.  I'm moving to New York.  They don't show up in Arizona?  No.  I mean, oh, God, they're so fat here.  You can't even believe it.  How does chicks on earth are in Arizona?  What are you talking about?  Phoenix? 
[00:28:30]  They're all healthy there because the sun is out.  If you're outside of Campy, you're screwed.  Dude, it's like Craigslist goes, or any of these places go anywhere.  This is the computer age, sweetie pie.  Just look them up in your area, and something will show up.  Really?  Yeah, it's like Field of Dreams, kind of.  I'm so, you're my hero.  Thank you.  All right, Rude Dog.  You guys have a good one.  They're amazed by your stories, Jimmy.  They're amazed all over the country.  It's amazing to me that they are.  I almost am embarrassed at the redundancy of my awful life. 
[00:29:00]  Let's go to Jeremy.  Jeremy!  Hey, surgeon's going to cut us apart with clean hands.  Well, there goes that bit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst.  The Opie and Anthony.  I know.  We should do a vacation break.  Tell everyone what we did. 
[00:29:30]  Went on separate vacations.  Yes, yes.  And did the cruise thing.  I went on the cruise.  And I did the Club Med thing.  Mm-hmm.  Down in Turks and Caicos.  A great spot.  Because Opie's into scuba diving now.  Oh, you want me to tell that story right off the bat?  You're a big scuba diver now.  All right, I'll tell the scuba diving one.  Turks and Caicos.  This is going to help the psycho factor in my head bit.  I can't believe you.  Yeah, I went to Turks and Caicos because I wanted to do some diving.  I dove all week.  I'm a beginner diver. 
[00:30:00]  I only have about 10 dives under my belt, so I'm not going to act like I'm Jacques Cousteau  or anything.  I had to go diving with...  What, dead?  Yeah.  I'm no Jacques Cousteau.  I agree.  So, one day...  Well, I just want to start this little story by saying French people suck.  Ah.  Hate them.  It's very international when you go away like that, Opie.  And there's a lot of people from a lot of countries.  And they should talk their girlfriends into shaving their armpits.  Ugh.  That's acceptable in Europe. 
[00:30:30]  That's what you want to see on a Club Med vacation.  French girls with big, gnarly, sweaty, black underarm hair.  Man, that's attractive.  And, dude, you can only imagine.  If that looks like that, what is...  Whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, I had a problem with this couple pretty much the whole time.  French couple.  French couple.  And they didn't speak English.  Yeah, we...  So, I go diving.  This was like midweek.  And, uh...  This is kind of... 
[00:31:00]  This is a good story.  All right.  So, I start my descent to the bottom of the ocean.  To the bottom of the ocean, Opie.  Well, they only take you 60 feet, but that is the bottom where we're going.  Bottom of that part of the ocean.  Sure.  You know, and then you get to go over some ridges and stuff where it's a little deeper, but whatever.  So, you're with the guide.  Now, I've done about nine or ten dives, like I said.  So, it was quicker for me to get to the bottom than, like, the guys that are doing their first or second dive.  Okay?  You're feeling more comfortable than you did.  Feeling a little comfortable.  So, I'm at the bottom of the ocean waiting for my fellow divers, because you've got to dive in a group. 
[00:31:30]  Bottom of the ocean.  Because I'm not really certified.  Yeah.  60...  Got your tanks on.  You're looking good.  Yes.  All right.  And I'm just looking around.  I'd like to fish and stuff.  Go, all right, cool.  I can't wait to start the dive.  Here comes the French guy.  What is this?  A group-up point or something?  You all descend to the bottom of the ocean?  Well, I mean, if you want to get technical, you've got to descend to the 15-foot bar for a while, hang out there, and then you drop from there.  But eventually, you're on the...  Yeah.  Bottom of the ocean.  Yeah.  As soon as they said drop from the bar, it took me whatever. 
[00:32:00]  Ten seconds to get to the bottom, more or less.  Okay.  Do a little equalizing, and you're down there, ready to go.  So, I'm at the bottom.  60 feet under.  And here comes the French guy.  That doesn't speak English.  That has the girlfriend with the hairy armpits that I just hated from the first day I saw him at the club.  And now he's new, because he's got to go through the whole orientation thing.  Without a doubt, this guy was probably making his first dive.  Uh-huh.  Maybe second tops.  Mm-hmm.  So, he starts coming down, and I look above, and I'm like, hello, I'm right here. 
[00:32:30]  Where was he looking?  He wasn't looking.  That's the problem.  Okay.  So, I look up.  I'm like, the son of a bitch is heading right for me.  Coming right for us!  Right.  Do I have the clip of Opie somewhere?  I think I do.  Here's Opie under the water, on the bottom of the ocean.  It's coming right for us!  Oh, wow.  See, this is how twisted my head is.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Yeah, exactly.  So, I obviously could have probably moved, and let him just land softly. 
[00:33:00]  On the bottom of the ocean, yes.  To where I was.  But I wanted to see where this was going to go.  Mm-hmm.  So, I look up, and I'm like, he's getting closer, he's getting closer.  Is he going to move?  Is he going to move?  He doesn't move.  His fin pretty much takes out the left side of my face.  Hard.  Boom!  So, his fin, he kicks you.  Yeah.  In the side of the head.  Yeah.  Now, does your regulator move or something?  No, no, no.  No, thank God.  You're under there.  No, because that would have been a whole different problem.  Then we would have taken it on land.  That's all I'm going to say. 
[00:33:30]  We would have.  Okay?  Usually, it's take it down a street level.  Okay.  We would have taken it on land.  On land.  You'll understand in a minute.  So, he kicks you in the face.  Yeah, pretty much the left side of my forehead here.  Did the mask come loose?  Did anything like that?  Right on the side of the head.  Right on the side of the head, mostly.  He came down like this, okay?  Ah.  All right, so.  So, I'm like, look at that.  And I'm a little pissed.  So, he hits me.  But, see, his legs were flailing as he's going down to the bottom.  So, that to me was like, okay, he's a beginner. 
[00:34:00]  I'll give him a little slack.  Right.  He's freaking a little.  But, boom, Finn hits me on the left side of the head.  He continues his descent.  Now, he's basically.  Here comes the jokes.  But, he's basically on top of me.  Okay?  All right.  His tank now nails my hip.  Wait, now he's coming down.  He kicks you in the head.  He's still coming down.  He's still coming down.  Now, the heavy tank nails me in the side.  All right, and if you don't believe me, I mean, I could show you a bruise, but everyone's  going to call me a **** and pull my pants down.  But, trust me, it's there.  All right.  But, if you need to see it, I'll, you know, I'll carefully show you the bruise. 
[00:34:30]  Really bad.  So, hold on to your seats, kids.  You're a pal, O.  So, at this point, I give him the, I don't give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm  just waiting for, like, a look of, wow, you know, I'm sorry.  I'm out of my mind.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But, he's French.  Except my apology.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter what language you speak.  You can look at a guy, and you can give him something with your facial reaction.  So, you're still willing to play this off as he's a beginner.  But, I'm heated.  Now, you're pissed. 
[00:35:00]  I'm heated.  On the bottom of the ocean.  He looks at me.  We're 60 feet under, okay?  Right.  He looks at me, and he doesn't give me anything.  Nothing.  You know when someone cuts you off and does a stupid move on the road, but you can almost  see through it if they kind of give it a look.  They look and go, eh, okay.  Kind of give it a look like, I know I screwed up.  I'm really sorry.  Please forgive me.  You're still a little pissed, but at least they acknowledged it.  Yes.  The guy didn't acknowledge it, and that really pissed me off.  Yeah.  So, I punched him in the head.  You punch the French guy in the head. 
[00:35:30]  Now, you're on the bottom of the ocean.  60 feet under.  I start a fight with a French guy.  What is wrong with you?  What is wrong with you?  Every year, I have to punch someone in the head, because I was just thinking.  Like, it's been a year since I popped Paul in the head in the studio.  Paul Bond.  Wouldn't that have been funny if it was actually Paul Bond diving down, and Opie punched him  in the head.  Now, where did you hit him?  It's right on the side of the head.  All right.  In the side of the head, you made sure you didn't hit his regulator or his mask. 
[00:36:00]  I was just going for the head shot.  Or you didn't even care.  You just happened to land on the side.  No, I didn't care.  No, because the rest of the body is pretty much protected with the vest and the tanks,  and you got a wetsuit on, you know?  So, I pop him on the side of the head.  Now, you're sitting there like, oh, my God.  Wow, you're so brave and stuff.  Yeah.  Obviously, it was a slow motion fight, because we're 60 feet under the water.  You couldn't really get a good punch flying underwater.  Even James Bond had difficulty in the movies. 
[00:36:30]  I couldn't get my weight behind the punch.  Right.  It was just kind of...  But it made me feel good.  And were you standing up at this point?  Sort of, yeah.  Your feet are kind of touching the sand at the bottom of the ocean.  I was probably just above the sand.  Oh, right?  I was trying to stay off the bottom, man.  Right, right.  And away from the coral and stuff.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Right.  So, yeah, it was like a $6 million man fight.  In slow motion, I punched him on the side of the head.  The French guy.  He proceeds to push me. 
[00:37:00]  Now, you're getting into...  You're into...  You're throwing down.  Yeah.  You're throwing down...  60 feet underwater.  60 feet underwater with a Frenchie.  Which, quite frankly, is kind of scary.  Like I said, I'm only 10 dives into my little diving chair, so it's still a little...  And he's fighting.  I'm fighting.  You can't fight underwater like that.  So he pushes me, but, you know, obviously the effort just isn't really there because you're not on solid ground and you're 60 feet under the water. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  So that's when I attempted to tackle him because your instincts take over.  Now, if you're on land...  Aquaman.  If you're on land, every fight starts with a couple punches, maybe a couple pushes,  and then you get down into hopefully wrestling and throwing someone down on the ground, right?  So, how will Aquaman handle this?  So my instincts take over.  I'm like, all right, well, I got to fight now.  No matter where you are.  I attempt to tackle him 60 feet under the water.  So now what?  Bring me through it.  How did you go to tackle? 
[00:38:00]  I just kind of went forward.  You went forward, of course.  And, you know, I tried to grab him and knock him down and realizing it just wasn't going to work.  At this point, the guide had to break this up.  He's breaking up a fight 60 feet underwater.  Yes.  Aquaman then whistled for a seahorse and rode off.  Now, I don't think the guide saw everything that was going on.  Oh, the rest of the people in our group definitely... 
[00:38:30]  They were watching?  Oh, yeah.  Placing some pets?  Oh, yeah.  I'd have been like, this is the coolest thing I'll ever see underwater.  I don't care if a goddamn mermaid swims by right now.  This is a brawl.  Wait, this guy's got a similar story.  A fight.  I thought this was quite unique.  Jesus.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hope kicking ass underwater.  Had something similarly happened to me in Cancun.  Yeah.  The guy, instead of, like, hitting me with the flapper, threw me like an elbow shiv right to the head. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So, instead of, like, retaliating that way with fists, I just ripped the dude's oxygen right off the dude almost drowned.  Now, that, I think, could be attempted murder.  Break him, dude.  I ain't taking a shot to the nose.  I know I'm bleeding underwater.  I'm, like, foggy.  For two days, I was like, duh.  You know, and I think this type of thing happens more often than you think because the dive guy, the guy that goes with you, he wants his group close together because he's got to, you know, watch it.  He's got to watch everybody. 
[00:39:30]  And, you know, some of these guys, when they're doing their first or second, I'm going to say it again, I'm only ten dives in, but I feel a little more comfortable under the water.  I mean, their arms and stuff are flailing.  They're freaking out because it's the first time they're underwater.  Will from Staten Island checking in.  You're breaking the rules.  He said, the first rule of underwater fight club is you don't talk about underwater fight club.  Underwater fight club.  It's Tyler Durden.  It was great, though.  Oh, get me wrong. 
[00:40:00]  I'm going to put you in my face.  Oh, dear.  He's got a good strength.  What is your problem?  Underwater fight club.  So then, yeah, then the guy, you know, he broke us up and we went on our dive.  I'm convinced he didn't see the whole thing because I think he would have brought us all back to the top.  And then the rest of the dive, any time he got close to me, I just kind of pushed him off.  I would stay away from you at that point, thinking you were a complete lunatic. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Who fights underwater?  Now, every contact the guy made with you, Opie, was accidental.  Careless, stupid, but it wasn't intentional.  Every contact you made with him was intentionally to hurt this gentleman.  Hey, I snapped.  No, no, no, no.  Underwater.  No, because there was a bunch of other things I could have done.  Turn off his air hose, that would have freaked him out a little bit.  Jesus Christ.  Did you take into consideration where you were when you decided then you were going to tackle this guy?  Man, I can't believe he is tackling me. 
[00:41:00]  What is this lunatic?  Let me make it perfectly clear.  It looked completely ridiculous.  You're right.  Yeah.  Nothing got done.  There was no, you know, no one really getting hurt.  It was just a fact that I snapped 60 feet under the water and punched a guy.  It's probably like hitting him with, like, marshmallows or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't really get a punch going.  So then the rest of the time, I would just give this guy the dirtiest looks around the resort.  And he just acted like, you know, his ass didn't stink. 
[00:41:30]  Well, he's probably right now on some French radio show going, you know, he's kicked his ass.  I punched him so hard he got their bleeds.  Jay Moore Buddy on the instant feedback, also wondering if you pulled any of the underwater matrix moves because you're kind of suspended there.  You could have done the cool matrix moves underwater and scared the pee out of him.  I go, oh, no, it is matrix.  No damage was done.  It was just the fact that I snapped underwater. 
[00:42:00]  Neo.  It frightened me.  Neo, right.  You know, you could get up, put your arms up, and then spin her out.  In place, looking bad.  Hey, Dave, what's going on?  Yo, I have to ask you, because, you know, I've been on dives before.  What did you do when you got back up to the surface?  See, I wish I had a good end to the story.  Nothing, really.  It was a big bow with a lot of other divers, and we just kind of avoided each other.  Oh, you're kidding me.  No, I mean, I got enough pleasure just trying to punch some guy in the face underwater, man.  Congratulations. 
[00:42:30]  All right, Dave.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Good job.  And you couldn't talk to the guy, because, like, I started the story off, and the guy  was French.  He couldn't speak a word of English.  No.  Scuba fight.  Great.  Scuba Steve over here.  All right.  How to fight scuba style from Rich and Faris Hills.  Flood his mask.  While he's blind, release his weight belt.  Swim away and enjoy your dive.  Nice.  Because the guy will go right to the surface.  Nice.  That's a really good idea. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  You actually started it.  The guy accidentally hits you.  I understand he hurt you in your hip and stuff.  Twice.  Twice.  But it was his own inexperience and, you know, inconsideration to not say anything.  You threw the first punch in anger.  He never punched me.  He never punched me.  He's underwater.  His first dive, he's probably petrified.  Like a wussy pushed.  Like a girl.  All of a sudden, I saw this brown substance oozing from his suit.  So I hit him, because he was close to me.  Should have picked up some fire coral and cut him. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  Like Sea Hunt.  Right.  Like an old episode of Sea Hunt.  Get the knife out of your leg and cut his air hose.  That's what he always did.  Hope he had lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Are you hearing the music, Elfie? 
[00:44:00]  Shut up!  Wow, I am getting pounded. 
[00:44:30]  Uh-oh, it's Opski.  And he ain't staking a nap-ski.  Oh.  Easy.  Oh, Frenchki.  Here comes Frenchki.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Hey, you stinks.  And your girl is hairy.  Oh.  So give it a left and a right.  Scoop. 
[00:45:00]  Scoop.  Scoop.  I'll kick Brutus' ass.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Popeye used to do some of that underwater fighting.  Underwater, but he ate the spinach and, like, his arms would go really fast.  And he can make his feet go in his pipe like a propeller and go like a torpedo into the guy.  So why don't you do that?  I forgot about that.  Oh, need me spinach.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Here, listen to me.  The human world, it's a mess.  Yeah.  And under the sea, it's better than you did you think I got a bear. 
[00:45:30]  The seaweed is always greener.  In somebody else's feet.  The sea is a member of the sea.  What?  At the world around you.  Ha!  The ocean floor.  Such wonderful things around you.  What more are you looking for?  Under the sea.  Under the sea.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it. 
[00:46:00]  Crawl around like a dog.  I'm sure they were full day.  I've been in the Sunday's day of the way.  While we've been floating, floating under the sea.  Under the sea.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  WXRK, New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock. 
[00:46:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Chris Cornell and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I've been doing subpar radio for the last 10 years.  What's that?  What was that, Howie?  Couldn't really hear it.  I've been doing subpar radio for the last 10 years.  That's a hell of a commercial.  I've been doing subpar radio for the last 10 years.  Well, Opie and Anthony haven't.  We made our names in the same 10-year period, Howard. 
[00:47:00]  Howard's a hack that couldn't adapt.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  1-866-313.  We're discussing what we should talk about next during the commercials.  And I'm like, I'm throwing, like, dumb little things around.  And Anthony goes, don't you worry.  I got what we should be talking about next.  That's an acute story.  And we're going to handle this with sensitivity.  And maturity.  Well, we've discussed male nurses before.  I'm sure there are one or two of you out there that are normal guys that just decided to become nurses for some reason. 
[00:47:30]  Greg Fokker.  Oh, right, right.  He's a male nurse.  Seems to be a normal male nurse.  Male nurse.  But most of you are homicidal maniacs.  I don't know why.  You're creeps with white shoes on.  Very creepy, usually overweight white guys with glasses, greasy hair.  Beards a lot of times.  Yeah, big beard. 
[00:48:00]  Wrong.  Mustaches.  70s porno mustache.  Some type of creepy facial hair.  And they just lurk from room to room playing God.  You, I will kill.  You, I will not.  But this guy took it a little further.  A male nurse forced an elderly patient to have sex.  Sex.  Hours after she learned she only had weeks to live.  This guy, Albert Rampal, 55, attacked the 74-year-old in a mental health unit at this nursing home. 
[00:48:30]  And another nurse said the patient told her,  A man made me have sex.  He said I must have sex.  The woman who had an inoperable brain tumor.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Gave a description of her alleged attacker with a brain tumor. 
[00:49:00]  He had three heads and a tail and was from Venus.  Apparently, it matched Rampal enough where he was arrested.  He was the only male nurse on duty that night also.  Do you think he just told her, look, shh, it'll be over soon, potato brains?  Hey, old puddin' head.  It's either this or the pillow over your face.  You choose. 
[00:49:30]  Either you get to say goodbye to your family or it's over right now.  I think he was just telling her the whole time he was doing it.  Come on, try to live it up a little.  Try to live it up a little.  Yeah, come on.  There's not much time left.  But a little something for me, honey.  Why am I always the one to give, give, give?  If I change your diapers, I change your sheets, I want a little payback.  Male nurses, though, the creepiest occupation ever.  What's creepier?  What's a creepier occupation for a guy than a male nurse?  That's a great question. 
[00:50:00]  There ain't one.  That really is a great question.  How do you, as a man, look at a 74-year-old woman with a brain tumor and go,  I have to have that.  Yeah, I need that.  Is anybody looking?  And I need it now.  And how do you function during it?  She's like, how does that motivate you sexually?  How?  Yeah, think of what that's got to look like.  What type of mommy anger are you taking out on some poor, helpless old bag?  I think you're making a point there.  I think there's something. 
[00:50:30]  I'm going out on a limb, but I think there's something psychological going on there.  Yeah.  Not just sexual.  All right, well, you could be right.  Good old Albert Rample, 55.  Well, there you go.  Just another one.  Put it in the file of creepy male nurses and what they do.  Can you read that other story that we were laughing at before the show?  The barber.  Yeah, it's from the, what is it from?  One of those advice columns?  Yeah.  These things are, you know, Ann Landers and Dear Abby pretty much pioneered these. 
[00:51:00]  Now they've just got everybody doing them.  Uh, this is Harriet Cole, Sense and Sensitivity.  Dear Harriet, I've been going to the same barbershop since I was 10 years old.  I'm now 17 and I don't trust any other barber, but this one.  However, the last time I got a haircut, I could feel my barber's entire, uh, area against my arm.  Is it a guy getting a haircut?  Yeah, guy getting a haircut, guy giving a haircut.  This has never happened before.  I quickly moved my arm out of the way and I felt disgusted. 
[00:51:30]  I don't like the way anyone else cuts my hair.  If this continues, I don't know what I can do.  Should I say something to him?  And, uh, she says, if you believe the barber is touching him inappropriately, chances are he is.  I don't know about that.  Nah, it's the price you pay to get a haircut.  There's a close proximity that goes on between men at a barbershop.  I usually go to a salon because I like a woman to cut my hair.  I like a woman to shampoo my hair. 
[00:52:00]  Every so often, the gay guy shampoos the hair and it ruins the entire experience.  I'm paying money to have, uh, for an experience here.  I want a nice shampoo with nice warm water and a girl's hands.  Because then sometimes, the girl won't just clean your hair.  She, like, massages behind your ears and your scalp and everything.  Don't lie.  The guy does the same exact thing.  No crap, but you don't want it.  So what were you doing?  Dude.  So what were you doing?  So I'm, I'm like all tense.  How miserable are you?  I'm so tense that it's ruining the entire, because when a woman's doing it, you lay down 
[00:52:30]  and you almost, there's times you'll lay there and go like, oh, you're moaning.  Like it's friggin', like it's sex.  You're moaning that she's massaging your scalp.  Some are really good at it.  You notice there are ones that are better than others?  Are you convinced that, uh, you could get something from, um, the girl that washes your hair?  Like she does such a good job.  You're thinking, wow, I think she's coming on to me.  Oh, like she's digging here or something?  I thought I meant like shampoo aids.  You almost want to catch something.  You almost want to ask for a number or something.  Like, wait, is she coming on to me? 
[00:53:00]  They're good.  And, and there's the perk in the summer, especially when they're wearing the loose tank tops,  they lean over you and you kind of get a view and then you're getting a massage on the top  of your scalp.  And, and some of them, like I said, really do it well.  Right.  When I go up and it's like, oh, Brad's going to shampoo your hair.  I instantly get tense and I, I, I feel like now I just want this over with as quickly as possible.  Like a prison rape.  I lay down and just let it happen and think good thoughts and, and end it as quickly as possible. 
[00:53:30]  It's the price you pay for a good haircut.  Sometimes you got to get a, uh, the old, uh, bean bag on your elbow.  I don't want a bean bag on my elbow.  You want to look good?  Take a face full of discipline, son.  No.  It's the way in the world.  Sometimes you got to take a bean bag to the back of the neck.  It's just, they got to get in there and make sure they're, they're cutting your hair.  He's talking, he's talking, he's shampooing the hair and it's like, uh, do you want, um,  do you want a cream rinse?  Do you want some conditioner?  No, no, just shampoo. 
[00:54:00]  I never, I don't even use shampoo.  Just damp, wet my hair down.  Finish this immediately.  When I was a teenager, I used to get my hair cut by a barber who used to sell like stolen  sweatsuits out of the back of his homoerotic shop and he was 400 pounds and he would press  his bunt on me.  Oh, he couldn't, he couldn't press anything else because it wouldn't reach.  It was in the way.  So it's just like the belly area.  It was like his, his lower stomach against my arm and shoulder.  And I didn't realize at the time it was like kind of homoerotic.  But as I got older, I'm like, yeah, that was kind of creepy. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Very creepy.  But, but there are certain things.  I remember, uh, my mother would work at a salon.  She was a receptionist at a hair salon back in like the seventies and the hairdresser  guys back then were all these Warren, Warren Beatty shampoo from the movie shampoo wannabe  guys with the shag haircut and the tight pants.  It looks like he has an armadillo in his pocket kind of thing.  Yeah.  And they were all like trying at least to pull off that they were incredibly heterosexual 
[00:55:00]  by trying to put the make on all the girls in the place and everything.  And when they cut your hair, they, they like arch their back.  So their junk area is as far, the furthest point forward on their body.  Oh, they got to focus.  So they could get like the long distance, right.  They're getting the long distance look on your hair.  Yeah.  But by that, the junk is like, what the hell?  Use it to hold the scissors at least.  Put it to work.  It's just kind of hitting me in the back. 
[00:55:30]  It's the old bean bag to the back of the neck.  No.  No.  Women.  I want women cutting my hair.  Well, of course.  You know, the woman with the nice, uh, the nice size chest trying to keep it clean over  here.  Something like that.  The shampoo.  Who doesn't love a little brush?  A little brush when they come around.  A little brush as they're brushing and cutting.  Yeah.  They're cutting.  They come around to the side and you feel a little brush on your shoulder.  That's nice.  You know, you don't, you don't lose your mind, but you go like, oh, if it's a guy, the 
[00:56:00]  whole experience is just uncomfortable.  I don't want to talk to him.  I don't want to like touching anything.  Let's go to Chris.  I'm like, do you, do you hate when you're getting your hair cut by a guy and he has to  get to like the back part of your head and instead of moving around the thing, he kind  of just grabs your head and pulls it down.  You've got a face full of armadillo.  Never quite had that happen, Jimmy.  All armadillo knows.  Usually when they go to cut the back of my hair, he goes around behind.  Is that normal?  It's not grabbing your head and pushing it forward and then cutting the back of your  head.  That's the way my guy would do it, but it was like, it was just easier because like I'm 
[00:56:30]  in the passenger seat and it'll be very hard for him to get around.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just a new technique.  And so they don't have to wipe the hair off of any clothing.  You should do it, nude.  That was exactly what he said.  He said, I don't want you to get itchy back.  Right.  So I'm going to put this on it instead.  Hey, let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Hey.  Hey.  Um, getting done with a haircut, the guy takes off the little cape, puts on a hand massager  and starts machading my shoulders. 
[00:57:00]  What?  One of those oldie time hand massagers?  Was it in a cylinder on the back of it strapped on with a couple of wires to his hand?  Was it on a regulation like barbershop?  Yeah, it was right in Smithtown.  The stuff where, the kind of place with the blue water and the cones in it?  Oh, God.  That old place?  Because that, there is nothing creepy going on in there.  Those type of haircuts are fine if you go into a barbershop and there's like a 60-year-old 
[00:57:30]  guy cutting your hair.  I haven't been to one of those since I was a kid.  But that always was just like regular haircut.  But as you get older and into your teens and stuff, you want a woman doing everything,  doing the shampoo and cutting your hair.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I want to say, first of all, I love your show.  I listen to it every morning.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks.  And when I go get my hair cut, I go to a nice salon and my barber is pretty big and his 
[00:58:00]  stomach is just like laying on my arm every time he cuts my hair or my back or just like  up to my shoulders.  He must give good hair cuts if you keep going back there.  Do you smell your arm when you leave?  It's called like belly sweat.  Belly sweat.  Do you know, I had to go to, I had to get a legit massage the other night because I hurt  my shoulder.  So I went to this place right around the corner from the cellar.  It's an Asian place, but they're great.  Uh-oh.  No, it was real.  Legit, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I was in real pain while she was doing it. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, that means it's good.  It was like nuts.  And Bobby Kelly I'm talking to.  And he's like, yeah, dude, because his girlfriend works in a salon.  And he has a gay guy massage him.  Why?  I don't know.  That's a field day for a gay gentleman.  Not on Bob's body.  Not on Bob.  You're right.  Wait, what?  Bob Kelly has a gay masseur do his massages.  And Bob recommended him to me.  Bob's like, the guy's great.  Yeah.  He knows what a guy wants.  Is he?  Is he great? 
[00:59:00]  I would like to know.  That's all I know.  I haven't gotten any details from Robert Kelly.  But, uh.  Well, let's get Bob Kelly on immediately.  Let's try to get him on right now.  He has a gay gentleman massaging him.  But we're trying to get a hold of him right now.  But, uh, first we got Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Kenny had a little story.  He has a little story.  He's going to try to keep it clean for, uh, for the radio or this half of the radio.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Yeah.  In a past life, my alter ego may have arrested a gay barber.  And his M.O. was he gets you in a chair and insists you read a dirty magazine. 
[00:59:30]  And he, and when you had the magazine.  Wait, but right there.  Wouldn't you just get up and leave?  No.  Not if you're, why?  It's kind of entertaining.  He insists, though.  It's like, ah, we got, we got some magazines over there.  It's not like he has a pile of magazines in front of him.  Like, ah, well, we got, uh, you know, uh, Sports Illustrated.  It might be inappropriate if he's pulling a copy of Highlights out of your hand and then  putting a Playboy in there.  I can understand that.  But, yeah, something like Sports Illustrated or something.  He's insisting. 
[01:00:00]  If it was one of the choices, then you're like, hey, this is something different.  Yeah, I'll check out the penthouse.  But he's insisting.  That's my first clue that something is a little weird here.  Sir, I'd rather just sit here.  Read it!  Right.  I insist.  Right.  And that...  Read the third forum letter.  Out loud!  Out loud!  As the guy was sitting in the chair and he would have the magazine in his lap, the barber  would point out pictures and just accidentally rub through the magazine. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, like, hey, look at her.  And since it's in your lap, by pointing at the magazine by proxy, he's kind of doing inappropriate  contact.  Right.  And then he starts cutting your hair and he's rubbing his, himself against your elbows as  he works his way around the chair.  Oh, is he good looking?  No, he was an old man, like a chicken hawk.  Chicken hawk.  How do you know that expression?  Come on.  Chicken hawk.  Former life.  The ultimate goal was to get the guy in the bathroom to service him. 
[01:01:00]  That was the payoff.  All right, fair enough.  Well, that was the barber's goal?  Yes.  Was to get, to do any servicing or get servicing?  No, he would do the ultimate service.  Oh, wow, that's haircut and that?  Yeah.  Well, how much?  Where is this place?  You got to soak your hog in the blue stuff they put the comb in?  A haircut and a...  Yeah, that's what they do.  You know, blow-dry your hair, of course.  That's what they call it.  Don't bow down.  Come on.  I was talking about the...  Relax.  Yeah.  That's what they would call it.  Because they blow it out after they cut it. 
[01:01:30]  Of course they do.  All right.  With the dryer.  Hey, when I was working at WBAB, there was an advertiser.  This guy owned a business where you got your hair cut by ladies that were topless.  That's interesting.  And then I think the guy got arrested eventually for prostitution.  Of course.  In the back room.  And they wanted them to be a huge sponsor on my nighttime attitude on WBAB.  And these guys would go there.  I would turn on a lot of listeners to this place.  And they would go there and get the most horrific haircut. 
[01:02:00]  Bold haircut.  But they didn't care because it was done by a girl that was topless.  Did Elo go there?  Exactly.  She was topless and blind.  Do you know that when I was doing Pugs and Kelly in Dallas, our friends in Dallas,  I told you one of their sponsors was a brothel.  And the brothel, I was doing radio there one time.  They hooked me up.  Of course they did.  And they got mad at me because the next day.  I gave them a stellar review.  But I was joking.  And I was like, yeah, yeah.  Like, you know, the whore at the brothel.  Just joking around like later in the show. 
[01:02:30]  And they got really mad.  They were going to yank their advertising like the nerd.  Because you said whore?  Yeah.  What do you think you do at a brothel?  It works there.  So I think I cost P&K a sponsor.  At least you got a little something.  I certainly did.  Bob, what's going on with this gay masseuse?  I mean, like, nothing.  Nothing.  Just massaging me.  Yeah, nothing.  Just massaging.  We understand that.  But the whole concept that you have a gay masseuse is a little off, Bob. 
[01:03:00]  Why is Anthony mad at me?  I'm mad at everybody today.  And believe me, if you listen after nine, you might just hear it because I am livid at  certain people at certain companies right now.  Yeah, there's people that are slowing down our careers and we're getting really, really  frustrated.  A couple of people standing in the way of ultimate success and bringing this show back  to where it was supposed to be five years ago.  The biggest radio comeback in history.  And there's a couple of a-holes standing in the way. 
[01:03:30]  Because we got people that don't understand the big picture.  And they will be dealt with, Bob Kelly.  They will be dealt with.  So what's up, Bob?  First of all, it sounds like you're just waking up.  Yeah, man.  I just went to bed.  Of course he did.  He's a stand-up comic.  Well, Bob, I threw you under the bus horribly.  We were talking about massages and stuff like that.  And I was talking about going for one.  And I was just saying that your girlfriend hooked you up with a gay gentleman and that  you recommended him to me.  I know.  And I should have recommended him to you with a wig. 
[01:04:00]  It would have been fine.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Daddy.  Now, why do you feel comfortable with a gay man massaging you?  You know what?  That's very open-minded of you.  I didn't.  But I lost feeling in my pinky from that driving.  You went to a gay masseuse because you lost feeling in a pinky?  Where did he put it, Bob, that made it feel better?  The shocker.  Let me just clench up. 
[01:04:30]  That'll help your pinky feel much better.  Boy, I feel silly with my arm hanging out like this.  You use a weird technique.  You use strange muscles to massage with.  I can understand if you lost the entire feeling of your lower half, maybe.  But you lost feeling in your pinky.  So you said, you know what?  I know what I have to do.  I have to go to a gay massage therapist.  If you were Christopher Reeve and he told you you could walk after this massage,  then I'd consider it.  Is it bad that he massaged me in the closet on my knees?  No.  As a matter of fact, it'd be bad if he didn't. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  So why the gay massage therapist there, Bob?  Well, you know, my girlfriend.  Hey, hey.  We're on regular radio, too.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I hope torgasm isn't filled with this type of potty talk.  Oh, my God.  I forgot that you guys are doing FM now.  Let it rip.  What, uh, yeah, why the gay masseuse?  And how do you feel so comfortable and not tense?  Um, I, well, you know, she, because, you know, I had this really bad problem. 
[01:05:30]  My, my, half of my arm was numb and I didn't have it for a month.  And I figured that I went to, like, a couple women on the road and they didn't, uh, you know, they didn't fix it.  So then I figured it out.  What a doctor.  If half your arm is numb, perhaps you had a stroke, you idiot.  I was paralyzed on my left side, so I didn't have medical insurance.  So I said, could you rub this out?  So I, Bob, there's the worst logic. 
[01:06:00]  Actually, this is the truth.  I, honest to God, I heard gay men are magical.  That's what, like fairies almost.  Yeah.  What, um, Bob, so he massaged you.  Now, what was the difference between his massage and a woman's massage that made you going back?  I got a, a, a, a, a, right, enough with that.  And he did too.  No.  Two men becoming excited?  That's fair enough. 
[01:06:30]  Now, Bob, really, honestly, without trying to be Mr. Funny Bob Kelly,  what's the difference that makes you keep going back to a gay man instead of a woman?  Oh, wow.  Okay, ask that question again.  What is it about, why do you go back to this gentleman instead of going,  going to him?  What's the difference between the massages?  Why did I go back to him?  Time and time again, yeah.  A few times?  Yeah.  Yeah.  His hands are strong.  Strong hands. 
[01:07:00]  And you know, Anthony, I don't know if you have this,  and you might want to go to this guy because you sound a little stressed out today.  Yeah, I am today.  He has very, there's trigger points in your back.  Yeah, one in the very, very lower part of your back.  It's a trigger point that turns you gay.  Yeah.  As soon as it's pushed, you're thinking, he just releases.  I'm not as worried of the trigger point as I am of the magazine points.  You know, where the clip goes. 
[01:07:30]  Wow, Anthony's really mad.  All right, well, I'm just letting you know that there's trigger points in the back,  on your back, and you need, this guy was, you know, a pretty strong man.  And I needed somebody strong to get the trigger points out.  Is he in shape?  Yeah, you know, he had that kind of, like, gay in shape, you know,  where the forearms were real veiny.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:08:00]  And you enjoy this.  Did I enjoy it?  Yeah.  Well, was that Ope?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give me back my camera, by the way.  I know you have two, and you don't even realize it yet.  You're the last person that saw my digital camera.  Give it back.  Oh, no.  You know what?  I didn't take your camera, but it is gone.  You don't leave anything at the cellar, and the frigging Arabs take it.  Great.  I left a light from a camera.  Well, can you tell the people at the cellar, they can have my camera.  I need the memory card back. 
[01:08:30]  There's some important pictures on there.  And maybe one picture that could get me in a lot of trouble.  Yeah, let me work it out.  All right.  That thing's erased.  You just want the card back.  I just want the card back.  You know, you could probably, if Jimmy talked to Ava,  that you'd probably just say, hey, they want the card back,  and they might give it back to you.  All right.  Well, it's not the cellar.  It might be one of the kitchen thieves, but, you know, Ava would give it back, of course.  All right.  Do we have anything with Bob Kelly here?  Are you failing miserably today?  We woke him up, too.  We didn't give him enough lead time.  Yeah, we woke him up. 
[01:09:00]  We want to know about the...  So he's like, what?  Gay man, massage, hi.  You decided to go to a gay massage therapist.  We're trying to get something out of you, but you seem a little tired today, Bob.  Yeah, well, you know, there's not really that much you're going to get out of me  when you're talking about me getting rubbed down by a gay guy.  You know, I might as well just tell you about me getting molested by my sister.  Ooh.  All right, Bob.  Did that happen?  Oh, you...  Oh.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  You are just an ass, Bob.  Bob, we've got to say goodbye to you. 
[01:09:30]  We'll get the story another day when you're awake, okay?  All right.  Thanks, Bob.  Buy hot stuff.  All right, we, uh...  We, uh...  Bob, one of the square pegs that don't quite fit in the round hole here.  What I'll do is I'll...  Some people can.  He can't.  I'll go to the...  I'll go...  Ah.  ...to his masseur.  Oh.  And I'll give you a report.  And maybe you give us a report on what is so good about that.  Now, if you just look at it as a Vulcan without any emotion involved whatsoever, you can almost 
[01:10:00]  see how he would like the stronger massage, but then you just go to a big Helga-like, you  know, German woman.  Yeah, Polish broad.  Yeah, Polish broad.  What have you.  Some woman with big hands and no sexuality.  Yeah.  This little woman I went to, this Asian woman in this place, they do like foot and back stuff.  I mean, her fingers, I was almost screamed at one point where she was digging into my  leg, like with a shoulder blade in the back of me.  So, you know, I don't need a man.  I don't want a man would have killed me.  She was strong enough and that was fine. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're the little Asian people.  They're the best.  All right.  We should take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Uh, blah, blah, blah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony and the best is Lady Di and Marion.  So, you can imagine the worst.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:00]  Hello.  Good afternoon.  Who are you?  Just a friendly little n***er.  What?  That's right.  I said it.  She's saying, listen, if we're going to get crazy, let's do it, Hammer.  Ouch.  Who are you?  We haven't seen you in so long.  We don't know who you are.  I was on the witness protection program.  Why are you?  Yeah, but now I'm back.  Jim Brewer!  I remember about, it has to be close to a year ago. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I said, uh, dudes, uh, I gotta go away for a while.  My wife's having a kid.  I'll see you in a few months.  Woo!  Your kid's gotta be like five now.  I almost went AWOL, man.  I couldn't come up here.  I was too angry.  Too angry?  Yes.  There should be a...  I'm not gonna condone what that lady did, but I'll tell you what, man.  I understand.  I understand.  DK, I almost went Norton on D a couple times. 
[01:12:00]  I almost went Norton on her a couple times.  Really?  I can't even tell you.  I wanted to, I wanted to blow up the car.  I threatened her.  I just wanted to leave.  I couldn't come up here.  That bad?  I'm trembling right now.  Give me a second to think.  What was the problem, though?  Bad labor?  Dude, no.  I'm just, I haven't been out in a long time, so...  All right.  You need anything?  You need a little...  All right.  We're gonna have a lot of fun today.  We've been having a blast, bro, in here.  Very good.  And we missed you.  God damn it.  I missed you guys.  I needed some giggles.  I feel good. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Well, we got lots of giggles today.  We have fun from the Iron Sheik.  Nice.  From yesterday.  Right in front of me.  We had the Iron Sheik in here yesterday.  Let's play this.  It was a lot of fun, but he went inside, as do many of the people that...  ...appear on the show to do a little promo thing for us.  You know how they say, hey, it's blah, blah, blah, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  And then we play it in and out of commercials.  Hey, Ben, why don't you give us an example of...  Give us a good example of somebody that's done...  Has done it the right way. 
[01:13:00]  The right way.  Is he a big dude?  Oh, God damn it, yeah.  I wouldn't mess with him, man.  Really?  He's big.  He's old big.  You know those big old guys?  Yes.  With a big solid...  Barrel, barrel, barrel body.  Stand up belly.  Very good.  You need, like, four guys.  Terranoran.  Reco-Roman wrestling.  Greco-Roman.  Greco-Roman.  Yeah, just give us one where the guy just did it normally.  Oldest country in the world.  Terranoran.  I'm from Terranoran.  The oldest country of the Greco-Roman wrestling. 
[01:13:30]  All right, so you guys have heard these things.  You know, we have a lot of these celebrities on the show.  Brewer's done it.  Yeah, you just come on and say, hey.  Hey.  Like, here's Ted Nugent helping us out.  Hey!  Working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things Sonic Bombast, Ted Nugent.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  There you go.  And even that is, like, long, but he did well with it because he has a lot of personality.  Even the you-know-what can manage that. 
[01:14:00]  Probably took him one take.  Steve, what happened after the interview yesterday?  Well, it was actually before the interview.  I got introduced to the Iron Sheik by Rick, and immediately I knew that this was going to be a long recording session  because the guy was having trouble with hello.  And we even have a script for you dicks.  It just says, hey, it's, put your name here, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's all you have to really do.  Right, that's it, and it's written right up in my studio, and I told him, basically, 
[01:14:30]  as long as your name and Opie and Anthony is in it, go nuts, have fun, it can be whatever you want to be.  Right.  And he launches into this.  You know, he's retarded, man.  You know, he's never known.  Nobody knows that the Sheik man's really retarded.  He's obviously retarded.  He took a lot of chair shots, though.  The Sheik man is retarded.  Just teach him to say this.  Go.  All right, so we have tape of Steve working it with the Iron Sheik here, trying to get something going on. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, it's painful.  It gets funnier and funnier.  This is about four minutes long.  Basically, it's whatever you want to say, whatever you want to say, as long as your name and Opie and Anthony is in it, whatever you want to say.  Okay.  Yeah, just do it.  You tell me when I go.  This is Iron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  Pleasure for me to the Anthony and Opie is one of the number one station in Manhattan and New York. 
[01:15:30]  And pleasure to come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans and hello to all people, to the wrestling, to the station.  Number one radio station in New York.  And pleasure to be here.  Good.  Oh, it doesn't end there.  No.  Now, all Steve wants, and you can tell every time Steve asks him, is just say, hey, it's the Iron Sheik, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's all we need.  That's all you want it.  Right.  So listen, Steve again will try to make him say it. 
[01:16:00]  And he just goes off on a tan.  Here we go.  And he says pretty much the same exact thing.  Same thing every time.  Good.  It peaked out a little.  What do you mean?  Opie, do you want to start a little?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's try it again.  Don't even say the station.  Don't even say the station, because this will go out in, like, 18 cities.  Oh, right.  Just to mention New York.  You remember that for a second.  No, don't even mention New York if you don't want to.  We'll try a short one.  We'll try a long one.  Okay.  So you just tell me anything, especially when I saw just talk about myself.  As long as your name and Opie and Anthony is in it. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Perfect.  Have fun.  All right.  Do whatever you want to do.  All right.  All right.  Yes.  This is Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opie bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And everybody know I'm the real Middle Easter man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world. 
[01:17:00]  Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American.  and also my Iranian friend,  and I want to say hello to all the Iranians.  I want to say hello to all the world.  And I want to say hello to all the world.  And I want to say hello to all the world.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time.  To I talk today.  Opie and Anthony, and pleasure for me always. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Opie.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Pleasure, pleasure for me.  I-W-L-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-C-A-T 
[01:18:00]  That's him spinning.  What do you think of America, Sheik?  Whoa. 
[01:18:30]  I can't catch my breath.  So that's what he did again.  Well, we still have more takes.  One more take.  So now Steve.  All Steve wants, get brewers.  You can do this, there's one more hammer, it's all you.  All Steve wants is his name, and he's listening to Opie and Anthony.  And, you know, any little, like, look, Brewer will inject a little of his personality.  Here's Brewer doing one for us.  It is Jim Brewer.  Ah, yeah! 
[01:19:00]  The air is about to rock!  Fire!  You listen to Opie and Anthony.  See?  But it's good.  There you go.  A little personality, you got the name and the trick.  That's all we care about.  The name, who you are, a little bit about what you're about there, and then Opie and Anthony.  That's all.  All right, so Steve again tries to convey to the Sheik, this is what he wants, and listen  to what we got.  Right.  Good. 
[01:19:30]  You want to do a short one?  Like something like, you just want to say, hey, this is the Iron Sheik, and you're listening  to Opie and Anthony.  Right.  I just want to say, hello, this is the Iron Sheik World Wrestling Federation champion, Olympic  champion, AAU champion, and this is the number one radio station in the world.  To you people, very, very be happy to talk, to listen to the Opium, and Anthony, one of  the greatest stations in the New York.

[01:20:00]  Better?  Better.  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  Just the Iron Sheik.  Open it, Hammer.  Take it off.  God damn, is that funny.  We never had that much trouble trying to convey a very simple thought to a young human being.  Okay, I just want to say everything I just said.  Pleasure, pleasure for me to Opium, Anthony.  I want to thank the frying carpet that brought me here.  I like the camels.  I like the sand and turbines. 
[01:20:30]  It's great to be from Theran Aran, great country, biggest country, oldest country in  the world.  I see you, Champlain.  There you go.  I jump on the trampoline.

[01:21:00]  Mr. Sheik, will you please introduce our next nominee?  Great to be here.  Happy to be at the Academy Awards list and the Best Actress Award.

I'm the chaplain, Charlie Chaplain.  I'm the chaplain of the church, and I champion.  Mr. Sheik, we have a special guest here at Shea Stadium.  He's going to introduce our first battle of the game.

We've got another minute to watch.  He's unstoppable.  Okay, so Steve then goes, okay, go on, go on. 
[01:22:00]  Help us out here.  I've got a lot of work to do.  Just say your stupid name.  Don't beat Anthony.  Dude, I just want to ride the high.  All right, here we go.  You want to just try opium and Anthony?  Again?  Yeah, just opium and Anthony.  Opium and Anthony?  Okay.  Okay.  I just want to say, pleasure for Aaron Sheik to come from all this country in the world,  Tehran, Iran, to the New York City, to I do the interview with the opium, and Anthony, 
[01:22:30]  one of the greatest radio stations in the world.  And I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  Dude, that was nice.  That was nice.  You're so full of crap.  Oh, I know.  Now, I see exactly opium.  Did you see what Steve was trying for here?  He's going to piece it together.  He goes, look, just say opium and Anthony.  He goes, just go opium and Anthony.  Then he's going to ask him to say another thing.  He'll piece it together.  He'll say, he's the iron cheek.  Opium and Anthony.  Right.  All pieced together.  And he couldn't even. 
[01:23:00]  How much more clear do you have to be?  Just say opium and Anthony.  Hello, pleasure to be here.  The greatest wrestle.  The iron cheek.  Greco-Roman.  It's from it.  Around the oldest country in the world.  It's great.  I learned how to roll my tongue when I was very young.  I wrestled Greco-Roman with my tongue.  It's great at Madison Square Garden.  MSG, great place and great to put in Chinese food.  Don't know what they put it in, but it's great.  Want the pleasure to be, to able to say pleasure. 
[01:23:30]  You got your ass to say the name.  All right.  So here's take five again.  Holy Jesus.  We're almost done.  Here's the next tour one.  Let's try, hey, this is the iron cheek.  This is the iron cheek.  The real old country man from all this country in the world, Tehran, Iran, come to the Big Apple.  And I have a pleasure for me to talk to the Opie and Anthony, greatest radio station in the world.  Right.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  And you listen to the Opie and Anthony, one of the top stations in the world. 
[01:24:00]  And, right.  If you want, if you want, if you people, my wrestling first wants to find out about the iron cheek, the greatest radio station in the world.  Pleasure for me to come today to talk to Opie and Anthony, greatest people.  Pleasure.  Pleasure for me.  Pleasure me, you bitch.  No, fuck.  He's either an alien or a slave.  I don't know what the hell's going on. 
[01:24:30]  He's fucking one or the other.  When I heard this in the office, I was crying.  It's like, how much more clear do you have to make it to this guy that we just want you to say this.  Look at that three.  Great.  Okay.  Iron cheek.  Just say, iron cheek.  Pleasure for me, the iron cheek, to be here today.  If you want to big fans of mine, you listen to Opie and your man, man, Anthony, and show a great pleasure.  For $10 billion, the big, big question. 
[01:25:00]  Iron cheek.  All you have to say is, I am the iron cheek for $10 million.  Okay, pleasure for me to say that, for the most money ever, to say my name, the iron cheek from the oldest country in the world, the Taranaran, great with Tamil jockey.  I love the camel toe and the woman, great thing.  I ride the flying carpet in the sand.  We hate America.  Did I say that?  Uh-oh. 
[01:25:30]  Someone is requesting something else here.  Bob, what's going on?  Yeah, hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Anthony, I hope you're okay.  It's a pleasure to talk to you, too, Opium.  Opium.  Listen.  You're the new name right there.  God bless him and that big, bull head of his.  All right.  That's what Bob says.  Thank you, Bob.  Okay.  Doesn't he have a big, fat, meat head?  His head was huge with that Greco-Roman mustache he had on it.  Pleasure for me to Greco-Roman Champlin.  We got to play the Superfly now. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The Superfly?  Oh, Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  You ever heard of the Jimmy Superfly Snooker ID?  No.  Oh, man.  Which, after just listening to the iron cheek, it's like slamming on the brakes.  Cheeks at retard and schooled it.  Listen to this.  Same thing, Steve had Jimmy Superfly Snooker just, he wanted him to just say, Opie and  Anthony, Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  Listen to this.  Okay, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  This is a Superfly Jimmy Snooker and you, uh, okay, let me start. 
[01:26:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Show business.  You raped that dude.  Uh, you want to, yeah, say anything I hate.  This is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time and I'll edit that in.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio doll.  Excellent, boss. 
[01:27:00]  Thanks, man.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker on your radio doll.  I think iron cheek beat him.  Show business is rude, bro.  Oh, well, you know, it just goes to show you.  That's what he does for money.  Slam your head harder.  He calls himself a sheep.  We're making a killing on his doll.  Can he talk?  Well, check this out.  Especially back in the old days of professional wrestling like that. 
[01:27:30]  You know, I don't know what kind of deals the guys are making now, but I would assume they're  still not very secure when they get let go.  And they just make the rounds like he's doing some comic book show.  And it's not like the old days where he would go in waving the Iranian flag back in 1990.  Oh, it was the American dream.  Dusty Rhodes, man.  Oh, God.  Where Sergeant Slaughter would be in there.  Big match.  Thousands of fans screaming.  Now he's like, hello, this comic book show.  Pleasure to be signed.  Comic book magazine for Americans. 
[01:28:00]  Pleasure to.  All right, just sign it.  Let me move on here, Sheik.  I got Knight Rider down the way here.  I got to have a David Hasselhoff sign.  I got to go.  You're holding me up.  Yeah, that's right.  You're holding me up Gidget's sign in my friggin' comic book.  Probably made him somewhere.  Here's a 19-year-old heroin addict.  I just want to be a wrestler.  Built him.  Come with me.  Great.  Keith.  Keith has a good story.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Pleasure to talk to you.  Pleasure to talk to you. 
[01:28:30]  We were hanging out.  One of my buddies is an independent wrestler.  After the show one night, we're hanging out in the bar.  He keeps the bar open until 4 o'clock by signing autographs for people.  And then he decides to go back to the room.  We're drinking Heineken's.  I called the guy, Jabroni, screwing around with him, and he chokeslammed me on his bed.  On his bed?  Ooh.  Hold me down and won't let me get up.  My buddy's cheering him on.  He's insane.  The guy is literally insane.  Pleasure to be raping you.  All right.  I'm on the box. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  This is the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  92.3.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Dead, I say dead.  How did it happen? 
[01:29:30]  He's dead.  I was just having secured conversations with you.  He's dead.  Oh, no.  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.  Give my condolences to the insurgents.  Bring on the virgins.  Yeah.  I sure hope that worked out for him.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed in an American airstrike. 
[01:30:00]  There you go.  Tax dollars at work, my friends.  A lot of you guys out there, you working, Joe's?  Might have paid for a rivet.  Might have paid for a rivet on that bomb.  Maybe a little of that white paint that they stencil, you know, bomb.  He might have paid for that with your tax dollars.  But apparently hit one of his safe houses.  Oops.  Doesn't that kind of make a safe house an unsafe house?  A little unsafe when you've been ratted out by your constituency. 
[01:30:30]  They've ratted him out.  There's a $25 million bounty on the guy's head.  Who gets it?  Well, I guess they sort that out now.  They see where the contacts came from.  They're saying Jordan was involved.  I don't know.  I don't know what Jordan has to do with it.  Wasn't he in one of those boy bands?  Was it that one?  I can imagine. 
[01:31:00]  But who gets the money?  One of the Marines?  No, if there was one.  If a Marine killed him officially, he doesn't get the $25 million?  No.  Oh, come on.  It's like information.  It's got to be like one of these savage civilian people that kind of, you know.  Oh, over there?  They've got to have some translator that knows what the hell that means.  And then they just, yeah, it was a safe house.  They were holding a meeting, which I just would have loved to have been a CIA mechanical fly on the wall during that one. 
[01:31:30]  And just seeing them all sitting there, plotting.  God, you know that's all they do.  It's not just sitting around going, holy jeez, did you see the game last night?  You know, you can't picture him talking about anything of, like anything else but just plotting.  America died.  They must, well, our next plan must be grander than the last.  And Allah must, it's just always a plotting, planning, not like,  Muhammad, your nails are so long. 
[01:32:00]  Do you ever clip those goddamn things?  No wonder you get nosebleeds when you pick your nose.  It's awful.  Just clip your nails.  Boom.  You know, it's never that.  It's plotting.  More explosives.  Where can we get them?  I hear Russia has missiles that we,  Ba-boom!  But imagine they really were just sitting around watching, like,  maybe a preview of Lucky Louie or something.  Just that, I got the Lucky Louie.  Just taking an hour away from plotting to do something silly. 
[01:32:30]  That Jimmy Norton, hysterical, fun, boom!  Right.  Oh, that, oh, okay.  I'm all in.  Pocket Ace is my, just sitting around playing Hold'em.  They're always, we just always picture them plotting in these safe houses.  They call it Fallujah Hold'em.  Yeah, the little Fallujah Hold'em.  Uh, pocket the rockets.  Rockets?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we, uh, apparently the American military, uh, 
[01:33:00]  got a nice, uh, nice hand on the flop in that one.  And, uh, boom!  Blew up their safe house.  Kablooey!  Got about, uh, seven other ones, I guess.  Yeah.  That were along with them.  Um, but Al Zarqawi was the, uh, the prize.  The head of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.  Number one, right?  The head of the insurgency.  Numero one.  Number one.  And it's not like some other guy's gonna step into this,  but this is pretty, a pretty big symbolic victory.  And, uh, uh, having him out of the way, 
[01:33:30]  he was really a hands-on guy.  And by that, I mean hands-on heads that were departed from bodies.  This guy was a savage animal.  His, uh, his hijinks or shenanigans, if I may call them.  I know that sounds a little serious.  Go back to, uh, you know, the early 2000s.  So, uh, he's, he's been wreaking havoc for a while.  We've thought we had him a few times.  Uh, but this time, just blew him right out of his New Balance sneakers 
[01:34:00]  that he was proudly showing on, uh, one of his videos.  Way to hate America, by the way.  I know, way to hate America.  Just throw on, like, Western wear.  The guy, uh, put out this video.  His latest video before he was killed was him shooting, uh, a machine gun  and just looking completely incompetent.  He had to have one of his lackeys come over and, uh, and cock it for him.  And he's just firing it all willy-nilly.  He had his own, like, E-Rock going, ugh. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, E-Rock, this isn't working.  E-Rock, help me.  E-Rock.  There it is.  There's the video on CNN.  No, you gotta do this.  Yeah, they just keep playing his buffoonery.  That's, like, his buffoonery video.  Well, this is the raw footage.  Yeah, it was just supposed to be him shooting and looking all badass.  Looking like a, yeah, a mother-effer.  But they, uh, didn't cut out the beginning of it.  Somehow we got that piece where the guy has to come over because he pulls the trigger,  nothing happens, but he's still trying to look tough, so he doesn't completely turn around.  He just gives the eyes to his lackey, like, uh, uh, uh, something is amiss. 
[01:35:00]  And the lackey's gotta, like, cock it, and then he goes off all badass shooting, and I  guess he didn't see that speck in the sky that was coming towards him.  You think that guy rolls his eyes and is like, oh, man, I should be running the show, obviously.  Oh, God.  We talked to him when we talked to each other.  Click this, stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah, like we talked to each other.  Hey, idiot.  What are you doing, jackass?  But it's, uh, it's all over the news now.  He's just wandering around.  Is he in heaven?  Is he in hell?  Is he just...  Where is he?  He's with the 70 virgins. 
[01:35:30]  Well, I got audio of him, uh, looking for the virgins.  Ooh.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, boy, was I duped.  70 virgins, and Opie brought up a great point.  Where do they get all these virgins?  It's gotta be 70 virgins per martyr.  The ratio there is so ridiculous that I'm starting to think, uh-oh, it's the same 70 virgins 
[01:36:00]  per martyr.  Yeah, they're reusing virgins.  So he's got, he's got, like, sloppy one billionth.  That's what he's on.  Sloppy one billions.  And then being a virgin is good.  Why are so many of them dead?  Yeah.  It's just like 70 per martyr.  What's the use of being a virgin if God just kills you off when you're 16?  So you could be used by these animals in the afterlife, but that's just it.  I don't see that happening.  I see, like, you know, if there is some kind of afterlife that is consistent with a lot of 
[01:36:30]  the ideology people have, it's a heaven and a hell type thing.  And if right now he's checking in at the Hades Hilton, getting a little pitchfork jabbed in  his butt, you know, I think he might be having second thoughts about now.  Eternity, eternity, how long is that?  It's forever.  Forever.  Forever.  Nothing but, like, he's trying to get some sleep and all his beheaded heads are just 
[01:37:00]  yapping at him all night.  Hey, how you doing?  Wake up.  Wake up.  Remember me.  Remember me.  Can I get some shut eye?  No, you can't.  I have no body because of you.  Just yapping heads.  Oh, that'd be wonderful.  You're a yapping with Jackie Mason accents.  We have to hear a Jewish voice.  Hey.  So, how are you?  What are you doing?  Oh, you like it down here.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  The buffet is nice, early, but it's special.  Just Jews all around him. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, Bill in Jersey.  This is a very interesting story.  I don't know if it's true, but we'll get into it.  Bill, what's going on today, man?  Yeah, this is back in 2004 when I was deployed to Iraq.  We happened to stumble across a guy who was worth about $5 million in Fallujah as we were  raiding the city.  And when we turned him over, we finally found out that was the story, and we didn't get a  single dollar out of the whole thing.  No, the soldiers don't get anything.  That's just considered like your job and stuff.  The rewards are put out for information, and the civilians over there in Iraq come forward 
[01:38:00]  and say, hey, pssst, I love this guy over here.  Screw that, man.  There should be like a Marines lottery over there.  If you're the guy that took him out, you get the 25 mil.  How about you get to go home?  Or at least get to go home, and you get to pick five friends.  Five friends to go home with you?  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  At least get a free meal or something.  So you took out a big wig over there, and you didn't get the five mil.  No, we got bragging rights.  That's about it.  Yeah.  Hey, dude, bragging rights are pretty cool, though.  Yeah, well, back home safe and sound. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, tell him that while he's back at his regular job.  Yeah.  They said they had him in 2004.  The Iraqis had him.  Yeah.  And let him go.  They didn't know he was.  Well, they're trying to spin this also.  Again, you don't know what to believe or not to believe.  They have a lot of bad news always coming out of Iraq, but they're saying that a lot of Iraqis,  and especially the new Iraqi military and police force that's being trained by the Americans,  have a lot to do with the communication between the civilians because there's this distrust of the Americans. 
[01:39:00]  So the more Iraqis, you get involved in the interrogations, in just basic talking with people on the streets in these areas.  Because you get information from people that kind of led on to where these people are hanging out,  and they pass it on to the U.S. military, and they don't even see it or hear it.  That's the best part.  You're just sitting there.  Like in the old days, World War II, let's say, you could be sitting in Britain and go,  Oh, blimey, look at this.  Sirens are going off, and I hear some type of buzzing sound. 
[01:39:30]  To the tubes, everybody.  And they run down, and there's plenty of time.  These guys, you just sit around.  You hear nothing, and then you're gone.  You're just gone.  It's almost too merciful.  You don't even get a thought.  It's almost too merciful.  You don't hear the aircraft that delivers these things.  You don't hear the actual missile.  It's just you're there, then you're in pieces.  Someone off the instant feedback, I think his name is Humps with an X.  Hump with an X at the end. 
[01:40:00]  You pronounce it.  Somehow wearing new bounces with your badass black ops uniform takes the edge off your message.  To the masses.  Oh.  You see him putting orthotics in because he has bad feet?  Yeah, right?  Dr. Soles.  My arches.  Well, here's the...  They've been killing me for years.  They give me hip pain.  They must have just had a stink-seeking missile.  Because you know they don't shower.  Well, here's the news coverage.  And then I got a very...  Well, me and my brother and I were watching the news before we came in here today. 
[01:40:30]  And an interesting observation.  But first, the news.  Coalition forces killed Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and one of his key lieutenants,  spiritual advisor Sheikh Abdul Rahman.  I miss him already.  Yesterday, June 7th, at about 6.15 in the evening.  Sheikh Rahman, too?  This happened in an airstrike that was conducted against an identified, isolated safe house.  Tips and intelligence from Iraqi senior leaders from his network led our forces to Zarqawi and some of his associates 
[01:41:00]  who were conducting a meeting approximately 8 kilometers north of Bakuba when the airstrike was launched.  Eight clicks.  Iraqi police were first on the scene after the airstrike.  I think it sounds cool.  And they were shortly joined by elements of Multinational Division North.  We have been able to identify Al-Zarqawi through fingerprint verification, facial recognition, and known scars. 
[01:41:30]  He's dead.  Facial recognition.  He must have just been...  Just his big, wide-open eyes and mouth.  Let's go to Josh and Phil.  It'd be funny if they find him who's in the bathroom, like, right off the toilet with his pants around his ankle.  People magazine.  Read about...  Why don't I ever make the most popular...  Right.  Read about Brad Angelus, baby.  Brad Angelina.  Brad Angelina.  Right, right.  Baby.  Oh, look at that. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, Josh in Philly, what's going on today?  Yo, how are you guys doing?  Oh, that's Paris Hilton.  Right.  Bam!  Boom!  Go ahead, Josh.  Yo, they said they're going to get 70 virgins when they get up there?  Yeah.  What's going on them?  Who says it's women?  Can you imagine?  There is a lot of young boy hand-holding over there for some reason.  All right.  What's going on?  Here's...  In those Arab countries.  Here's the Iraqi Prime Minister's announcement.  Yeah.  This was a little interesting. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I love this one.  There's a translator in here.  And the message to those who want to follow the Iraqi people's journey.  And the message to those who use the crime, the murder, the terror, the terror, and the terror.  And the message to all the Zarkawis and the ones that stand behind them.  The result is... 
[01:43:00]  The result is we don't swear in the hands of the Iraqi people.  This is a tragic result they must reach.  Today...  And there you have it. 
[01:43:30]  We're giving away 70 virgins, people.  70 virgins.  Be dying.  Be dying, martyrs.  Martyrs, be dying.  Look, 70...  I'm going to unwrap one of these right now.  Look at what...  This is one virgin.  You're going to get 70.  70.  70.  Not 69.  70 virgins, people.  Be dying. 
[01:44:00]  Get it on the flex pay.  Half your body now, half later.  70 virgins.  We're looking for martyrs, people.  We're looking for martyrs.  Be dying.  And we're going to throw in a Maguire rookie card.  A Maguire rookie card.  Come on, people. 
[01:44:30]  We're talking virgins.  It's like having sex with a toaster.  All for just blowing yourself to bits.  Blow yourself to bits, people.  70 virgins.  Count them.  Count them right here with me.  One, two, three.  Okay, take my word for it.  We don't have time. 
[01:45:00]  Give me a clock.  Two minutes on the clock.  Kill yourselves, people.  Be killing yourselves.  70 virgins.  70.  70.  And I'm throwing in a Sosa.  I'm out of my mind.  Out of my mind.  Did he go?  Loved that guy.  He's now doing wrestling.  Dan West.  A little old school, but it's still great. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, so then we move on.  Transitions into other stories.  Gem mint 10 virgins.  Gem mint 10 condition.  Look at them.  All right, they're a bit hairy, but that's authentic.  Shave them down, nair them.  Do whatever you got to.  70 virgins.  Gem mint 10.  Let's say hi to Jay and Queens.  Jay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going for 70 virgins. 
[01:46:00]  The phone lines are going berserk.  And so are the martyrs.  But I do not want men.  All right, let's go to Jerry on Long Island.  Jerry.  Hello, Don.  I want 70 virgins.  I plan on dying.  Yes, Jerry.  Yes.  Jerry, this is the deal for you then.  70 virgins.  Do you got any explosives around the house?  Strap them on your body.  Walk into a synagogue. 
[01:46:30]  Doug, you're going to be getting 70 virgins.  Can I put that on FlexPay?  Put it on the FlexPay.  It's guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  Right now, Elzar Cow is reaping the profits.  He's probably only worked through 10 of them.  60 left for all eternity.  Sounds like it goes fast, but you could double back.  Once you use one, you don't have to give it up.  They're yours forever. 
[01:47:00]  And they only increase in value.  And the Maguire rookie card.  That's what I'm interested in.  Thank you, Don.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Loved that guy.  Very nice.  Someone suggested maybe they were watching Sex and the City when they got blown up. 
[01:47:30]  Speaking of getting blown up.  Die.  Dint, dint, dint, dint.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Well.  Akbar.  Akbar from a 7-Eleven in, it looks like Queens.  What's up?  Yeah, Lord.  Akbar, do you have 70 virgins for me, please?  We got Akbar on the phone.  Akbar, how are you this afternoon?  70 virgins.  Quickly, please. 
[01:48:00]  Tight.  You want 70 virgins?  70 virgins.  One, two, seven.  Akbar, are you plotting?  Is there plotting going on?  Because you just got to plot and then wait for the missiles.  That's right.  Before you know it, you're knee deep in 70 virgins.  We're going to send them to you.  Right.  Dar.  And we'll even, let me tell you something.  Oh, my God.  I've just been handing this. 
[01:48:30]  Each virgin going to be re-virginized after you use them.  Re-virginization.  Re-virginization.  Re-virginization.  I don't even know what the hell it means.  All right.  The phones have gone nuts.  Let's go to Josh and Woodmere.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Berserk.  Josh, Woodmere.  Yes.  Hi.  Hey, Josh.  Hey.  My brother actually just got those virgins about a week ago.  Let me hear about it, Josh.  I'm glad that it's back on. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, we did this offer.  We've been doing it now for about a million years.  And everyone's satisfied.  Everyone's satisfied.  I like bar.  I like bar.  I like bar.  I like bar.  I like bar.  On FlexP.  It sings a song to me, and I got to get it.  Well, Josh, be dying.  Be dying.  Let's go to Pat in New Hampshire.  Pat. 
[01:49:30]  Yo, boy.  What's going on?  Hey, Pat.  Pat, New Hampshire.  He's got a question about the virgins.  Are these limited edition?  Limited edition.  Everyone, Jim Mint 10 condition.  Jim Mint 10.  You're going to use the McGuire rookie card like a spark plug gapper.  That's what I'm talking when I mean virgins.  Hey, Danny from the office in New York City wants to know if you're going to go ahead and open one up.  Well, then she wouldn't be a virgin, would she? 
[01:50:00]  Only authentic virgins.  Authentic virgins.  They want to make sure they're getting the real deal, though, Don.  What do you think?  Don West is lying?  I'll kick your ass for a man.  More people want to talk to Don West.  I'm just waiting.  Oh, that'll be good.  And then you won't be able to talk to Anthony the rest of the day? 
[01:50:30]  Well, this is a good question, actually.  Actually, Eric on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Don?  How you doing, Eric from Long Island, Eric?  Love Long Island.  I'm doing great, man.  Hey, do these virgins come with a new pair of New Balance shoes?  Every virgin, you're talking 140 New Balance shoes.  140, one for each foot, unless the McCartney bitch is one of them, but she ain't a virgin.  Mark and Queens, we have time for maybe a couple more calls. 
[01:51:00]  Mark from Queens!  Guys, listen, I just received my virgins last week.  I'm using them on a daily basis.  They are unbelievable.  Allah bless you, Mark.  Allah bless you.  There's a guy using the virgins.  How did you die, Mark?  Oh, my God.  I had 37 kids in a building, and I just blew myself up.  Fantastic.  All for the cause. 
[01:51:30]  Al-Akbar.  Al-Akbar.  Al-Akbar.  Be dying, people.  70 virgins, limited edition.  And with that, I guess we have to take our first break.  We're going to take a break, but we'll be right back.  70 virgins.  It's the ONA virus.  The phone lines are going berserk.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Night, two, three. 
[01:52:00]  K-Rock.  Night, two, three.  K-Rock.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  We've got to get Earl in here, because there's something that we can talk about with Earl that a lot of people can relate to.  Oh, my God.  Classic Earl.  Hi, Earl.  It's Clubber Earl.  How you doing, Earl?  Clubber Earl.  Clubber Earl.  Hey, fool.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Why don't you come home with a real man?  I see you survived your ski day. 
[01:52:30]  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  And then you went to Nadine's going away party last night.  How was that?  For a few minutes?  Drunk in the bar.  Anything happen at the going away party that you want to share with anyone?  Earl, comment.  Anything?  Comment, Earl?  Anything?  Anything?  Anything happen?  Anything.  I can remember.  Nothing you can remember.  Were you drinking, Earl?  No.  No.  Yes.  Were you talking to Nadine, giving her your best wishes? 
[01:53:00]  For her future?  Of course.  It was a going away party.  Yeah.  Why not?  Sure.  Wish her luck at the hospital where she's going to work?  Yes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And that was about it?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Had a drink?  Mm-hmm.  No, you don't even drink.  Anything?  Had like a ginger ale, maybe?  Ginger ale with a cherry.  I didn't even have that.  I had water.  Oh, water.  Water.  Good, good, good.  Anything happen that may be thought of as uncomfortable?  Anything?  Anything, Earl?  Anything, Earl?  Comment, comment?  No.  I had no idea what you're talking about.  No?  No.  Anything awkward or strange or maybe uncomfortable? 
[01:53:30]  Nothing?  Nothing?  Comment, Earl?  Anything?  No?  Did you ask her anything?  Anything?  Any questions?  Earl?  Question?  Comment?  Answer?  Earl?  Did you ask her anything?  Anything.  Anything?  What'd you ask, Earl?  Did you ask?  Whoa, whoa.  Uh-oh.  I think, I think, ladies and gentlemen, let the record state, I did not do that one on.  Earl just threw something at Ben for laughing.  Earl, anything?  Why are you getting mad at Ben?  Why did you throw something at Ben? 
[01:54:00]  I was just laughing.  He was in the way.  Wait, you were throwing at me?  No.  This is the wrong day, my friend.  Earl?  Any other day, it would be a lot of fun.  Earl, anything?  Was asked?  I wasn't even mad at me.  Well, obviously, that got a reaction, because you're throwing stuff at Ben as he giggles.  No, because he's just sitting there cackling like a goddamn chicken.  Why do you get so pissed off when Ben cackles?  Why?  He's enjoying himself and having good, clean fun.  Yeah.  Ben's enjoying the show. 
[01:54:30]  Just a white man laughing.  Right.  What do you think, Earl?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong?  Do you have a problem with Ben when he cackles?  Can I go now?  No, no, no.  We need you.  We need you.  I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.  All right.  I'll give you a couple more little hints.  Lock the door.  Anything you can remember asking Nadine?  Yeah.  Ask her any questions. 
[01:55:00]  Did you ask her anything last night?  Nadine.  Nadine.  Earl, comment.  Beautiful Nadine.  Anything.  She's pretty.  Beautiful Egyptian goddess Nadine.  Anything, Earl?  Now that she doesn't work here anymore, I think we can say, without getting a sexual harassment  suit, a fine piece of ass, Earl.  She's cute.  Anything?  What do you think?  Did you ask her a question?  Did you ask her a question if she could do something for you? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Anything?  Earl, comment, please.  Well, I always, knowing that, what the reaction will get from her, I always say, I always use  the Opie question, where she goes, can we see your stuff?  Oh, you asked her that?  What?  That isn't what we're talking about, but you asked her to see her.  But I always, but I know what type of reaction I'll get from her, that's why I asked her.  I have no idea.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, my God.  He's lost his mind.  Oh, my God.  Earl has lost his mind.  Wait a minute.  Earl, get back.  Hold on, Earl.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ, Earl.  What's wrong?  Jesus.  He looked like he was floating playing.  Holy Jesus.  Earl lost his mind.  He wanted to kill Ben.  What's wrong?  Ben's laughing too hard.  He's having much too good a time.  Okay, Earl.  So, you asked to see her stuff.  I have no idea where this is going.  Did you ask Nadine to maybe attend something with you? 
[01:56:30]  What?  What?  We're going to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  Ah.  Here's the rub.  Eddie Trunk does a couple of rock and roll shows here.  Yes.  Very good ones.  And he does a very good job.  They rock.  And he's getting married.  Yes.  And you need a date.  So, you...  What did he need?  A date?  She wanted to go.  I didn't have a ride.  So, I asked her.  So, you figure you'd ask the lovely Nadine to go with you.  Nothing's going on. 
[01:57:00]  No, no, I know.  Earl, did you ask Nadine to go to Eddie Trunk's wedding?  Yes.  You did.  That's a date.  A wedding...  Also...  To go to a wedding with somebody is kind of like a night out together, which is a date.  So, I was...  No, but there's more to it.  I know there's more to it.  And this is the most funnest part of this whole story.  No, she said...  She said, I...  You asked her.  Hold it.  You walk up.  No, I did not ask her.  How did you ask her to go to the wedding with you? 
[01:57:30]  Give me your line.  What was it?  She knows Eddie.  I know Eddie.  Right.  We both...  I said, do you want to go to the wedding?  You want to go to the wedding.  You got invited to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  Yes.  Right?  Nadine did not.  As far as I know, she did not.  So, you went up to Nadine and said, Nadine, would you go to the wedding with me?  Eddie Trunk's wedding with me?  Yes.  And there was a butt attached.  And what...  No, what...  A butt on whose part?  Yours or hers?  Or hers.  No, I know.  That's what we're getting to.  But at first, you walked up to Nadine, pretty Nadine, and said, would you go to Eddie Trunk's 
[01:58:00]  wedding with me?  There's nothing into this.  Rick, I'm not...  Earl, I ain't even going to go there.  I ain't even going to go there.  You're right.  But you went up to her like anyone would go up to anyone and ask to go to a wedding.  What was her answer?  She said she can go, provided that she can bring her boyfriend with her.  What's so funny about that?  I don't know.  Like...  There's nothing going on.  That guy, shut down.  No. 
[01:58:30]  Dude, there's nothing to shoot down.  When you go up to a girl and ask her to go to someone's wedding, that's like asking someone  on a date.  And then, okay, but I'll take my boyfriend.  Let's say you're in high school and you want to ask someone to the prom.  They never...  I know the guy.  They never shoot back and answer to you like, well, yeah, but can I bring my boyfriend?  Oh, my God.  Put that down, Earl.  Oh, no.  Put that down.  Oh, no.  Here is what happened in essence, Earl.  If you really think about it. 
[01:59:00]  Do we have nothing to think about?  No, no.  Do we have a wedding in that...  In that...  Why does she have to bring her boyfriend?  Right.  That annoys me.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, no, Eddie.  What's pretty much, Eddie?  Why does she have to bring her boyfriend?  I had no problem with it.  Yes, you had no problem.  But here's what happened.  You, in essence, sent Nadine an invitation to Eddie's wedding plus one.  You gave her an invitation...  He's not even going.  ...to the wedding.  He's not going.  Who's not going? 
[01:59:30]  Nadine's boyfriend is not even going.  Why is that?  I haven't...  First of all, Eddie...  Earl, is it true that you also called Eddie and said that I'm bringing two dates?  I didn't say bringing two dates.  I went...  Eddie asked...  Wait, let me go...  Let me backtrack this whole...  Okay.  All right.  I was not going to the wedding.  Oh, you were?  At all.  Yeah.  Because I did not have a ride to the wedding.  All right.  I said, I do not have a ride.  It was Eddie's suggestion.  It's like, you know, if someone is...  If you can get someone to go with you that has a ride, there was a couple other people 
[02:00:00]  here from the station that are going.  Dude.  Earl, I love you.  You know...  That's great.  But let me tell you...  Nothing.  Hold on.  There was nothing.  Maybe it was your whole...  Nothing.  Hold on.  Maybe it was your approach.  Because if...  You should have went, hey...  There was nothing.  Hey, Nadine.  Are you going to Eddie Trunk's wedding?  You are?  Great.  Can I get a ride?  There was nothing about the approach at all.  Nadine and the boyfriend didn't ask you to put on chauffeur uniform for that night,  too, did they?  No.  There's nothing to do with it.  Take me to the Piggly Wiggly first. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, Nadine's in the studio.  Nadine, how are you?  We called you a piece of ass because I thought you weren't employed anymore.  We didn't think you were here anymore, so please don't file any sexual harassment charges  against us.  So, did Earl ask you to Eddie Trunk's wedding?  Yes, he did.  He did.  So, what's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  There is nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's definitely nothing wrong with that.  I didn't think there was anything wrong with that, but...  Oh, Earl, Earl, there's nothing wrong with it.  There's nothing wrong with asking a girl to a prom, a wedding.  We are both friends with Eddie. 
[02:01:00]  But how uncomfortable was it?  It was obviously uncomfortable, because see how he's reacting?  Earl, you know what you do, though?  How uncomfortable was it, Earl, when Nadine had to tell you that, can I bring my boyfriend?  Earl, you know what you've got to do?  You've got to aim a little lower than Nadine, though.  Maybe ask the El Salvadorian cleaning lady that comes in.  There's nothing...  Norton knows by experience.  No, Earl, Earl, it's okay.  So, you asked her, and what did you actually say, Nadine?  Exactly what Earl just said.  I don't know why I said that, because I think that's really wrong. 
[02:01:30]  That's rude.  Do you think you probably said the rudest goddamn thing?  That is so rude of me.  Why would you say that?  I was not going to try to go through that.  There's nothing going on.  That is shot down.  I really took guts.  I don't know why I said that.  Yeah, that's rude.  I know why, because you got scared.  You're like, oh my God, I think he's asking me out on a date, and I'm uncomfortable here.  Yeah.  And I do have a boyfriend, so I'm just going to tell him.  Did you see the way he looks at you when he talks to you?  No, there was nothing to it, because we both know Eddie, and we're going to the wedding,  and he's getting married. 
[02:02:00]  I know Eddie, too.  But then you had to call Eddie and say that you're bringing two people to his wedding.  Yeah, that's it.  Now, let me know what happened.  You call up Eddie Trunk, and you ask...  I called Ed, and I said, because he needed to get the RSVP by Monday.  I called him on, I think it was Sunday or Monday, and I said, I can't go, but...  He said, I might have a ride, but there's a problem.  We might have to bring another person.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  What did he say?  He called me back and said, we're overloaded. 
[02:02:30]  And he called me back.  Oh, and then he shoots the whole thing down.  Isn't that embarrassing?  Like, I don't need another...  Oh, this whole thing is so awkwardly...  I didn't even get invited.  I don't sense the awkwardness in it.  I told my boyfriend that I had done this, and he was so mad at me.  He's like, that is so rude.  How can you even say that?  Good for the boyfriend.  Good for him.  I'm not going.  First of all, I wasn't invited.  You weren't invited, and I don't think you should go.  Nadine, man, you've got some set of brass balls.  Here's a...  Here's a... 
[02:03:00]  I will not go.  Earl, I'll take you, and I'll drink out of your mouth.  This was going to be a bit.  Earl, Earl...  I'm not going.  Earl, I got a song for you and Nadine.  Who is this?  Oh, Jesus.  No, Earl.  Hang on, Earl.  Earl, don't go crazy, Earl.  Hang out.  Earl...  Oh, my God.  Earl's going to punch somebody.  Rick is in front of the door, and he's not letting Earl out of the studio. 
[02:03:30]  Earl, it's okay.  Hang out.  Hang out.  Hang out.  I can't believe it.  Hang out.  Now the mic broke.  You broke...  No, stop doing...  Hey, Pete Johnson's going to yell at you.  Hang out.  We'll keep it track today.  Oh, my God.  Is he pissed.  We need a new PSA.  We need a new megaphone, and now we need a new microphone.  Is he pissed.  Earl, there.  That mic's fixed.  Look.  Because I feel so secure when we're together.  Everybody. 
[02:04:00]  Lighters.  Yeah.  Every rocker has his soft side.  Yeah.  Oh, this is awful.  All right.  You know, look who's on the phone.  Maybe he can shed some light on this.  All right.  Let's go to Eddie Trunk.  The groom, Eddie Trunk.  What's up, boys?  How you doing, Ed?  Congrats on your wedding, by the way.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm down in Florida, actually, and I just got a call from Johnny Hardrock telling me  that I should call in, and then Rick called me, and I just heard a little bit of what's 
[02:04:30]  going on on hold.  Well, here's what happened, as we understand it.  Earl was invited to your wedding.  He could bring a guest.  He asked Nadine, because Nadine lives close together, and she has a car.  So that's Earl's ride.  That's the only reason.  I'm not even disputing that.  No, that's what you...  Everyone else is implying that.  No, no.  She's even applying that it was something more.  Nothing else.  You don't think?  Zero.  Well, anyway, then Nadine decides that she says, okay, I'll go, but I want to bring my 
[02:05:00]  boyfriend, to which, instead of Earl going, are you out of your mind for even suggesting  that?  He goes, let me call up Eddie.  I wasn't even thinking that.  Well, here's what I know, okay?  First, let me preface this by saying, you know, anybody who's had a wedding knows that  it's pretty difficult to try to get everything in line and meet certain criteria.  For head count, et cetera.  Right.  Everyone knows it's always, there's too many people and the cause and everything.  Well, you know, Jim Norton invitation gets lost.  I'm sorry. 
[02:05:30]  Go ahead.  No, continue, Eddie.  Go ahead.  I invited Earl and a guest, and I got a phone call down here in Florida a couple days ago.  I reminded Earl that the RSVP date was this past Monday.  And I didn't hear anything from him, and I said, what are you doing?  And then he called me back, and he said, listen, I don't have a ride.  And I said, well, you know, if you're really that hard up for a ride, there is a train  that goes right to where the church is.  If that works for you, if you can't make it, don't worry about it.  And he called me back, and then he said, well, he said, I can bring Nadine, but the 
[02:06:00]  only way I can do that is she gets to bring her boyfriend as well, so can you give me  a plus two?  A plus two, like it's one of the heavy metal shows that Eddie's, uh...  Earl, you got balls, man.  Earl's looking for comps.  It's the poison show.  That's the only way I can do it.  I need plus two.  If that's not a problem, I will not go.  Maybe Nadine's boyfriend will pass out.  He drinks too much, and then Earl's got to even...  Hey, man, it's in.  Maybe the boyfriend drives while you...  No, no! 
[02:06:30]  Earl, wait, no!  No, stop!  Oh, my God, he's smashing the mic!  That's like a...  That's a very expensive, uh, microphone.  Earl, you're...  Watch the Judas Priest CDs.  Earl, you're scaring Leif Garrett.  Leif Garrett is petrified outside the studio.  Hey, Eddie, is Piazza going to the wedding?  Um, I'm here...  He's in spring training, so he's obviously not going to be able to be there, but...  No, all right.  I was hoping I'd get to sit at this table.  Earl, Earl!  Ow!  Earl, look at that microphone now.  Earl, let him go.  What do you want on that mic?  Let Earl go. 
[02:07:00]  Don't hit...  Don't hit Leif Garrett on the way out.  Can I say something?  He's a teen idol.  He's a teen idol.  Yeah.  Nadine, yes.  I'm all fairness to Earl.  Honestly, I know that he had no other agenda in asking me that.  He just knows that I love Eddie Trunk.  Uh-huh.  He asked me to go because, you know, he thought I would like it.  I think I'm the one who created this whole mess.  Yes, you did.  That was awful.  That was so horrible.  You're a dirty girl.  ...of me to ask that.  I didn't even think I would get away with it, but he said he would ask, so I was like,  okay.  But I didn't even know that my boyfriend was going to say no. 
[02:07:30]  I totally knew that, and that was cool.  I don't know why I just asked that.  I guess because I could.  That was pretty stupid.  But Earl, what I had told Earl was that I would give me a couple days because we still had  some last-minute RSVPs coming, and if there were some people that couldn't make it and  a spot opened up, I'd be happy to say, yeah, no problem, because it wouldn't have been  a problem.  But then I found out that we're, like, exactly on our number, and there was no way that it  would work without setting us into a different area of money.  Right.  I totally understand how that works.  Just to be put in that position is just horrid. 
[02:08:00]  Like, I invited him and a guest, and he wants to bring two people.  Here's the thing, here's where Earl's got to learn.  I found that Nadine had a boyfriend, like, when I first met her, I never went more than,  hey, I nodded her.  There you go.  Never talk to her again because she's hot and she has a boyfriend.  We have nothing in common.  You don't ask a girl with a boyfriend to a wedding because she's going to want to bring  him.  I would never say that at all, but the only thing is that I only see him once a week,  so I figured he was going to be at my house anyway.  Nadine, hold on.  Pete Johnson is in the studio now. 
[02:08:30]  Pete, did you see what Earl did to the mic?  Nobody white did that.  Pete, did you see that?  Can you believe that?  I don't know what you guys do to him.  He took the mic and he slammed it onto the top of the counter, so I don't even know if  the mic works anymore.  Never mind the wire ripped right out of it.  Let Pete fix the mic.  It's my job.  I can do it.  Pete's not happy.  The studio is his baby. 
[02:09:00]  I thought Opie did something.  Opie, Opie, whatever.  All right, check that mic.  Is it going to work?  Does it work?  Hello?  Oh, it kind of works.  It'll work?  Say hello.  Hello?  Pete, you're a genius.  Thank you.  You fixed it again.  Where's Earl?  I got to talk to him.  You got to fix Earl now.  I think a lobotomy might do it.  All right.  Wow, Earl lost his frigging mind.  Guys, how did this even come up on me?  Where did this even come from? 
[02:09:30]  Was it Earl saying it?  Nadine had a little going away thing last night, and Earl decided to ask her at the going  away thing.  Actually, no.  That's not true.  He didn't ask me yesterday.  I kind of slipped and said that because I had too much to drink.  And I didn't realize having Ben, Stinky, and everybody else there, they made a field  day out of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben called me immediately, matter of fact.  That's my fault.  I'm like, Ben, what's so important?  He couldn't even talk.  He was laughing so hard.  He gets Earl so pissed. 
[02:10:00]  Earl's ulcer right now.  Looks like the girl we shot the blood at yesterday.  Good for the boyfriend for saying no, though.  You got to respect that guy.  He's like, no way.  Yeah, yeah.  That guy, he must have a big mule because he's willing to let her go.  He's like, I'm not coming.  Just go with him.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  So, Nadine, even if I could have gotten the plus two, he wasn't coming anyway?  Well, no.  Yeah.  Actually, he feels really uncomfortable about it, and he didn't want to go to him anyway  because he knew that he wasn't invited.  Well, Matt Devotee's on the line.  He'll give Earl a ride.  It's no big deal.  Earl's got to go to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  Yeah.  That's not what this is about. 
[02:10:30]  Earl, I was kind of hoping you would say no because he didn't want to go anyway.  I would not have put you through that.  Like, I don't think that's right either.  Look at Nadine talking to Earl, knowing Earl's at his desk on the other side of the building  listening right now.  Fuming.  I'm safer here.  Fuming.  All right.  See, the only thing I can say is that I did say to Earl that there were alternatives,  offered him viable alternatives to get there, train other people that might have been coming  from the area, and what he came back to me with was this scenario of Nadine plus one, 
[02:11:00]  which, you know, again, nothing against Nadine.  I mean, like I said, I would have liked it about everybody, but you just, besides my family,  it's just the wedding's out of control as it is, so it just wasn't going to work.  It was like trying to get tickets for somebody.  It was like, yeah.  Yeah.  I need a plus two, you know?  It's like...  All right.  All right, Eddie.  Well, good luck to you.  Thank you.  Have a good wedding, and we'll talk to you soon, all right?  I appreciate it.  Congratulations, man.  Yeah.  Thank you.  See you guys.  Thanks, Nadine.  There we go.  Sure.  Good luck at the new job.  Thank you.  Have fun.  Thanks, guys.  I'll miss you.  You hot piece of...  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  I thought she was gone, and we could talk that way.  All right, Ed.  Yeah.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Is it true you saw the QVC guy this weekend, Anthony?  Oh, dude.  Spent two hours.  Yeah.  Two hours.  Two hours!  Two hours, people!  Just watching the QVC guy.  Yeah.  I could not tune away.  He was so excited. 
[02:12:00]  He's selling like this box set of baseball cards, and you don't know what you're getting.  But for some reason, for like 99 bucks, in this box, is like a billion, million, billion,  trillion dollars worth of baseball cards, according to him.  Okay.  You'll turn around, guaranteed in every box, at least one card worth $150.  And hell, you might even get two.  Look, let me just open them up.  I'll open a box. 
[02:12:30]  You'll see what's in them.  What you can get.  Look here.  Right off the top, it's Ken Griffey Jr.  Ken Griffey Jr.  Ken Griffey Jr.  It's a rookie card.  I'll keep going.  Look, right on top, a McGuire rookie card.  McGuire rookie card.  McGuire rookie card.  Look, another Ken Griffey Jr. 
[02:13:00]  And then he's taunting the people.  There's a limit, people.  Five of these.  You can get five boxes.  Buying one is a waste of time.  That's what he's telling them.  I'd buy five, hang up, call, and buy five more.  Because if you buy one, you're going to open and go, I should have bought five. 
[02:13:30]  And then he's like, grammatically all wrong.  This, you won't have a more funner thing you can buy for $99.  Gail Ripken Jr.  When he took the curtain call.  I'm crying.  I'm crying like a big pussy.  I f***ed myself.  And I'm selling the pants I f***ed myself in.  For some reason, every time he's selling them, he's got like, every box set he sells has 
[02:14:00]  about 20 McGuire rookie cards.  He's sold like hundreds of thousands of these things.  I think everyone in the world has a McGuire rookie card at this point.  How much could they be worth?  It's beautiful.  McGuire rookie card.  And then he goes, and it's a limited time, people.  As a matter of fact, guys, give me three minutes on the clock.  You got three minutes more to order this box set. 
[02:14:30]  And then three minutes ticks by.  The clock goes to zero.  It disappears.  And for five more minutes, he's like, you got to call now, people.  You got to call now.  You're not getting a deal like this again.  As a matter of fact, we have 100,000 more boxes of these in the back.  We're burning them.  We're going to burn them right now.  For the love of God.
