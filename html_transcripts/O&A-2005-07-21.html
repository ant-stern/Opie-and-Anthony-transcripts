<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with the hosts bragging about their popularity, immediately transitioning to a discussion about producer Ben's emergency room visit after a near-miss with two taxis.  Opie shared similar near-miss taxi stories.  The show then played and reacted with highly offensive commentary to audio clips from "A World According to," a show featuring three gay men and a female co-host.  The hosts' discussion of Angelina Jolie's adoption of an African child was equally crude and insensitive, filled with offensive jokes.  A chaotic interaction with an obsessed fan, Sandy Kane, who brought her camera, escalated into an offensive exchange culminating in Opie destroying her camera.  Further offensive jokes followed Sandy’s offer of a music CD.  The hosts then reacted offensively to a news story about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' adult rating, criticizing Hillary Clinton and the video game industry.  This segment ended with a patriotic rant and more vulgar commentary, followed by jokes about Scotty's death from Star Trek.  Pat from Menaki, and a couple, Paul and Denise, were briefly in studio for commentary and jokes.

The show's central focus was a targeted harassment campaign against Jim Phillips and his XM Satellite Radio show, "The Phillips File." Opie and Anthony, along with their listeners ("Opie and Anthony Army" or "PES"), flooded Phillips' lines, rendering his show largely unbroadcastable.  They justified this action by citing Phillips' perceived arrogance, plagiarism (specifically claiming he copied their "assault on the media" bit), lying about his show's success (contradicted by an XM executive, Eric Logan, and later Elo), and downplaying their own show's success.  Numerous audio clips from Phillips' show were played and criticized, with particularly derogatory comments aimed at his female co-host, referred to as the "Minister of Morons" and other offensive terms.  Listener calls, many containing obscene language (played only partially), were featured, some successfully challenging Phillips' claims, like Doug Out Doug.  A website showcasing unflattering photos of Phillips and his co-host was also mentioned.  The hosts repeatedly used vulgar and offensive language throughout this segment, reiterating their intention to continue their attacks.

A chaotic in-studio segment followed, featuring Sandy Kane, Frenchy, and Patty, alongside Paul.  This segment began with a sexually explicit anecdote about a Lincoln Tunnel encounter and quickly devolved into vulgar exchanges about bodily functions, sexual acts, and insults, particularly directed at Sandy Kane.  A running gag centered on a large genital wart ("Twado") attributed to Sandy Kane, which was repeatedly discussed and visually focused on.  Homophobic and racial slurs, and misogynistic comments were prevalent.  Attempted scene readings from *The Shining* and *Goodfellas* were interspersed with the chaotic conversations and insults, ending with near-physical altercations before the guests were ushered out.

Finally, a segment involved a chaotic attempt at performing scenes from *Jaws* and *Pulp Fiction*.  Initial frustration over a poorly transcribed script led to a discussion about using scripts and including female characters.  The group chose *Jaws*, assigning roles: Andrew as Quint, Pat as Hooper, Frenchy as Brody, and Big A as Mayor Vaughn. The performance of the Mayor Vaughn scene and parts of Quint's monologue were punctuated by laughter and ribbing, especially targeting Frenchy’s performance and script errors.  The performance ended abruptly during Quint’s monologue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[00:04:00]  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  They are living among us, average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing  to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Howdy, Quaid.  Howdy, Quaid.  Hello, Quaid.  Hello, QT pie.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning.  Good fucking morning, Anthony.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jim.  Good morning.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:00]  The phones have exploded, so we got to get right into this.  Of course.  Ah, it's going to be a fun, fun, fun, fun field hour.  Let's say hi to Dan in Albany.  Dan, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  How are you, sir?  Hi, Dan.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, listen.  That poor bastard, Jim Phillips, got attacked yesterday.  He had some cum dumpsters screening all his phone calls. 
[00:05:30]  He couldn't even get through.  So with the 1-800 number, busy, busy, busy.  And then every time I got through it, I have to listen to the show.  He was complaining about how everyone was fucking calling in and attacking him.  The lady friend there said that he came up with the idea,  and then he said he borrowed it from some other guy.  But that makes no sense, because he was claiming it as his own and that he was original.  But he was very, very upset about all the people calling in and wrecking his little drive show. 
[00:06:00]  So fuck that guy.  What is it?  The Phillips file in Orlando on what?  WTKS?  WTKS.com.  Phillips file, 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the East Coast.  The phone number is 888-978-1041 or 407-916-1041.  The assault will continue for a very long time, by the way.  Yeah.  Because he thought it was all fun and games yesterday.  He has no fucking idea what he's messing with. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, it was all cute, I guess, and fun.  And I guess he was making the best of a bad situation.  Situation.  Wow, that was quick.  When our listeners just pounded his phone lines.  Right.  He could not do a show.  That's what happened.  I guess he's under this notion that this is being done to get our name out.  Why would we pick a show that I personally, I've never heard of? 
[00:07:00]  I swear to you, I have never heard of this guy.  Not in the way he says he hasn't heard of us, because that's just an outright lie.  I'm probably one of the most modest people ever.  I don't really like saying, hey, we're huge, we're this, we're that, we're the other thing.  But the fact of the matter is, if you're in radio, you know who we are.  It's just a fact.  That's what happens.  We've been in enough high-profile news stories, high-profile situations, 
[00:07:30]  that people in this business know who Opie and Anthony are.  It's just the way it is.  If you're in radio and you say you don't know us, you're lying.  You're just lying.  It makes you seem silly and very uneducated as far as the business goes.  He's a plagiarist.  Well.  Easy with that language, sir.  We've also found out he's quite a liar, quite a bullshit artist. 
[00:08:00]  Well, radio is filled with guys that just lie.  I mean, you know, they know they can get away with it, so they'll say anything.  Yeah, but this wasn't about getting our name on his show because, like I said, I've never heard of the guy.  Why would we pick a show that I've never heard of to get our name out there?  The reason our callers call you, and it's not to make jokes to make the callers seem funny to your listeners  or to make you laugh or to trip you up.  It's to ruin your fucking show. 
[00:08:30]  It's to wreck your show.  Your phones, apparently your phones are a big part of the show.  That's what people that have listened to your show have told us.  And judging from clips I've heard of your show yesterday, you really are incapable of doing anything but taking calls  because the rest of the show was really bad.  And I've said about people I can't stand on the air, you know, I can't stand it, but they did something that was funny.  I heard this bit, and I can't deny that that was funny or entertaining or something. 
[00:09:00]  This was some of the most boring drivel presented in this, I don't know how else to say it, in old fogey fashion  with just a meat hole sitting next to him that just was this stereotypical radio hose sucker  with nothing to contribute but, oh, yeah, oh, really?  Oh, I wanted to step on the radio, just step it and squish it. 
[00:09:30]  Horrid.  And apparently he doesn't have the capability to do a show without the callers.  We then take your callers out of the mix because our listeners are just motivated assholes.  They're pests.  They're just annoying pests that will not let up.  You might have had a little fun with it.  It was a little exciting for you, something new for you yesterday. 
[00:10:00]  This won't stop.  You will not be able to conduct your show on a daily basis.  It will get old for you really quick.  And the program director of the station already has come up with a mass email that she's sending  to all the listeners and stuff.  Well, keep sending it.  So they're already trying to figure out how to get out of this.  Yeah.  Goof on our callers.  It's going to get a lot uglier.  And it's funny because I heard a couple clips and he's joking about the ONA Army.  We joke about having an ONA Army.  But the reality is we have pests. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  That's the reality of this.  You know, yeah, the ONA Army, sure.  You know, a lot of radio shows and stuff over the years have had this, quote, Army mentality.  Yeah.  We joke about actually having an army.  The reality is we have a bunch of pests.  We're afraid of them, idiot.  We're afraid of these people.  They're not mentally stable.  And they don't let up.  They will not leave you alone.  And it's just going to get worse on this guy.  What an animal. 
[00:11:00]  Doug was.  Oh, Doug.  That's half your listening audience.  It's Doug out Doug.  Fucking eight times I heard him.  I'm just kidding.  They don't have anything better to do.  No.  They are truly dedicated to making people's lives miserable.  And on occasion, including our own.  This isn't something we don't go, hey, go ahead, attack them.  And they, you know, blindly follow us.  They enjoy this shit.  That's what this guy doesn't understand. 
[00:11:30]  They take pleasure in this.  It's very organized.  They do it themselves.  And they will continue this on a daily basis.  You think it was all fun and cute.  You had fun with it.  Making up little names.  They will destroy your show.  And it will not stop.  It will keep going and going.  By Friday, you'll be all pissed.  The weekend will come.  Maybe you'll think it'll be over with the weekend.  Monday will roll around. 
[00:12:00]  They will be there again.  Just wrecking your show.  And like I said, it's not about getting our name on your show.  Who the fuck are you?  It is purely.  There is nothing more involved here than ruining your show.  And they're reorganizing as we speak.  Yeah.  That's it.  They are so psyched and pumped up to do it all over again today.  And they will.  And tomorrow.  And Monday.  And Tuesday.  And I'll just keep going and going and going. 
[00:12:30]  Thursday.  Friday.  Tuesday.  Sunday.  You think it's going to be fun?  You think it's going to be fun and a novelty and something that you can enjoy and go with?  Yeah, bring it on like you said.  You couldn't take it for an hour before you were dumping out of every call.  You couldn't take it.  You were saying bring it on.  But was he bringing it on?  He was dumping out of everyone's call.  I would have loved to hear Grady's call in its entirety.  Whoever that was, when Grady called, I almost pissed myself. 
[00:13:00]  Your son.  I was on the phone with you when that happened.  Oh, I know.  Me and Jimmy.  I started laughing my ass off.  I couldn't get the link.  And he just starts rolling.  I'm like, what?  He's like, Grady just called the show.  Grady.  I was going to start from the beginning, but we'll go right to the Grady call.  I got to hear Grady.  Grady, you're on real radio.  I hear him.  Just respirator.  You know, it looks that your son is going to be...  Grady, you're turned out.  Right when he said Grady.  Dump it.  I can't have that.  Yeah, dump it.  Dump it.  Yeah, bring it on. 
[00:13:30]  Bring it on, everybody.  Bring it on.  We're here.  We're smarter.  We're quicker.  We're more entertaining.  Oh, this is what he was saying.  And so just bring it on, people.  Dump it.  Dump it.  No.  Dump it.  Dump it.  That's right.  Why don't we start from the beginning?  We got some fine audio from...  I can't stress the point.  From the Phillips file.  This will continue every day.  Because I hate this guy for listening to his show, and I hate the broad he has with him, 
[00:14:00]  the fucking keep everybody in line.  I'm not funny myself, broad.  Just when you think perhaps there's one woman on radio that isn't that stereotypical bag of  shit that we goof on on a daily basis, there she was yesterday.  There she was.  Everything we hate about women in radio, there she was.  She's the audio equivalent of a slug trail on linoleum.  You add nothing funny to the show.  You're not a funny person.  Oh, yeah.  And he's not a funny person. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, now.  Settle down, boys.  Oh, guys.  You're there to keep the lady listeners happy, you fucking unfunny bitch.  That show stinks.  They're on XM 152.  No one's ever heard of them.  They're not listed anywhere.  The Phillips file.  Go fuck your mother.  Your show stinks.  Yeah, they're on XM as well as we are, obviously.  With his lie.  With his lie about ratings.  And I know a little secret about the Phillips file, the monsters, and Channel 152 in general.  Oh, what's the secret? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, that's why we have to call it a secret right now.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait until you hear this one.  We have a nice little surprise for the fine folks on 152.  Because sometimes I have an idea about, since he wants to take on the O&A Army and this  and I have a great idea about upping the ante.  This is an advantage to satellite.  How about this?  How funny would it be if everyone that called the show was fucking filthy?  Everyone that calls that show during the assault should be fucking filthy.  Then let's see what happens.  How many laughs you have when you're worried about an FCC violation, stupid. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, worried about it.  Then you can't even take your own callers.  A curse word.  Every single person should be filthy.  Filthy.  Then we'll see how much dump you have and how fast you are and how much that unfunny bitch  sitting next to you can go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, and cover up the fucking filth coming  through the speaker.  Oh, the army's calling again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, major douchebag, you're on the phone.  It was all fun for a day, wasn't it?  You got a little fun with it for a day.  You were able to talk about something a little different than the usual boring crap. 
[00:16:00]  We pretty much wrote your show yesterday.  You didn't have to prepare a show yesterday.  Well, I hope you liked it because it's just going to go on and on and it's not going to  stop.  And your listeners, they'll just be non-existent, your callers.  They will not get through.  Our pests will tie up your phone lines and destroy your show again.  And it's obvious.  It's so obvious.  You cannot conduct a program without phone calls.  You have nothing.  You have nothing. 
[00:16:30]  If you want to join the rest of the past, you just go to Whackbag.  Whackbag.com.  They're organizing as we speak.  Yep.  It's going to get really ugly today.  Join the fun.  I read a few posts from a lot of people.  It was their first assault and they were enjoying the shit out of it.  There is nothing more fun than just kicking some ass wipe when he's on the ground.  There was one thing about the Phillips Assault thread and at one point there were 20,000  views.  Yeah.  20,000 views of the post.  But we have no listeners, I guess.  No.  Our ratings are, we're the number one most listened to non-music talk show on XM. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, really?  Really.  Well, coming up on the Opie and Anthony program, the head of programming at XM Satellite Radio.  What would he know, Opie?  Logan will be calling the program.  What would the head of programming at XM, of all programming, what would he know?  See, because unlike, you know, the rest of radio where people just lie and get away with  it, we back our shit up with facts.  So, Eric Logan will be calling the program in about 10, 15 minutes to give us some numbers. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know what?  I actually think this guy is pretty highly rated because it's always the sign of a good  show when they interrupt you with G. Gordon Liddy sometimes.  That's always a big sign of a great show.  That shows that you're successful.  Yeah, cut half and all.  It shows that your show is the number one most listened to non-music show when they cut  an hour out of it to put G. Gordon Liddy on.  You guys are doing so well.  Let me tell you what we're going to do for you.  You don't have to do as much show.  You're doing so good, take an hour off. 
[00:18:00]  We'll shove G. Gordon Liddy in there.  Wow, we are good.  You ass.  You bullshitting ass.  Do you have the explanation?  He did one of the calls.  Oh, wait.  Let's start.  Let's start.  Here's the Phillips file.  Phillips file.  Listen to the bullshit.  Phony voice.  Fake laughing.  Phony laughing comes out of his mouth.  A lot of bullshit.  So, let me backtrack to tell you what's going on.  Because then you'll hear some callers to try to figure out what the heck is going on. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  A couple of guys on the radio.  They're on satellite radio.  They're on satellite radio because they can't keep a commercial job.  All right.  I'll give him that.  Point taken.  Point taken.  All right.  He didn't lie about everything.  So far, he's correct.  All right.  We'll give him that.  Although Citadel did throw us back on commercial radio for, what, a day and a half?  Good old foray who's too busy banging a young broad to run the company, right?  We'll get into that story someday. 
[00:19:00]  Our old friend Farid.  Thanks.  MIA because he found a young broad.  Thanks for the $11 stock tip there, Farid.  $19 to get in.  It's down to $11.  Thank you, Farid.  That's why the stock's going down.  We got in at, what, $19?  It's down to $11?  Yeah.  And I found out recently that he's nowhere to be seen anymore because he found a young broad.  Great.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  He's not even running the company anymore.  He is, but he's not.  Does he think he is Greg Hughes? 
[00:19:30]  Come on.  That was very funny.  Still to this room.  I'm still doing a fine radio show and giving it my all every day, you ass fight.  All right.  Here we go.  They get fired everywhere they go.  So they finally suck enough ass to get a contract with the satellite radio, right?  All right.  We did suck a little ass out.  Suck ass?  We had two companies, two satellite companies that wanted it.  Vying for our attention, for our affections.  All right.  So far, so good. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So apparently they picked up on where I was talking with these guys.  Remember a few weeks ago?  Talking with the Newsbreakers guys?  Now, remember I talked to, what was his name?  Buck Owens.  Buck Owens.  Right.  Because I had this idea that we'd send somebody out to live news reports because if you've  listened to this program over the years, you know that we have a thing when it comes to  local news.  We're not trying to promote the program.  We have concerns and criticisms with the way that local television news handles the reports 
[00:20:30]  out in the field.  So we thought we'd get some goofy character out there when they're doing a live report,  the dance in the background, shadow box in the background, whatever the case might be.  So these heckle and jekyll or whatever the hell their names are.  Hey.  So they hear that I'm ready to do this and they think I'm ripping them off.  Well, the fact of the matter is, I don't know who they are.  Lying.  Oh.  You don't know who we are, huh, Jim?  Again, if you're in the business of radio.  You have no idea who we are. 
[00:21:00]  You know who we are.  Really?  How do you sleep at night lying to yourself and your listeners?  I have no idea who we are, sure.  We only have one of the biggest radio stories in the history of radio.  We've been in the paper a couple of times and on TV just a few times.  Just a few about our shenanigans.  What is it with these fucking Florida DJs?  This jerk-off, Lex and Terry, and who is the other one?  Shannon.  Shannon Burke, Monsters.  They all sound the same.  That's the weird part.  Yeah.  But with just trashing you, this guy, I mean, we kind of smashed him first. 
[00:21:30]  But what is it with these guys in Florida?  They're like the fucking worst.  The worst.  Really bad.  Awful.  So, I mean, obviously he's lying right there.  I'm going to point out all the lies.  He's lying.  He knows who we are, like Anthony stated at the beginning of the program.  I don't know who they are.  Lie.  I got the story from the New York Times.  All right, see, and that's another lie because he's saying he got the story from the New York Times.  We were prominently featured in that exact New York Times article.  It talked about Arthur Cheyenne and us getting him fired with our assault on the media. 
[00:22:00]  And it was also an article about the Newsbreaker guys, a small little troop in Rochester that does some wacky things during live newscasts, okay, when the reporters are on the street.  Yep.  So he's lying right there because he's saying he got the idea from the New York Times article.  But we were in that New York Times article.  I call these guys for the Newsbreakers.  As a matter of fact, if you listen to the program, you'll remember when I talk to Buck Owens, I say, can I rip you off? 
[00:22:30]  This is so good.  It's so fascinating.  It's so interesting.  Do I have your permission to rip you off?  Because the fact of the matter is the Newsbreakers were doing these bits well before Donald and Slim.  Another lie.  We have video going back.  The lie was overshadowed by just horrible ad-libbing skills.  Donald and Slim?  Donald and...  I can't think of anything that rides with Donald.  Slim?  Who's laughing in their car at that? 
[00:23:00]  Donald and Slim.  Oh, his little hole was laughing her ass off at some of his names that he came up with.  Oh.  Heckle and Jekyll.  Holy shit.  What?  Is that the best you have, dude?  That is.  Donald and Slim?  We've been doing the assault on the media at least five, six years now.  Way before the Newsbreakers.  Way before the Newsbreakers.  We got the wow and the girl topless on the Today Show.  We got the C-word on live TV here in New York. 
[00:23:30]  And then, of course, the Opie and Anthony signs have been going for at least five, six years.  Right, Steve?  I spoke to those Newsbreakers guys, and they're not saying...  They didn't say anything about doing it before you guys did.  Nothing.  They're nice guys, so I don't know where this guy's coming from.  I'm just pointing out all the lies, because, you know, in radio, this is completely acceptable.  You can just go on a radio show and just completely lie, and you don't have to back up any of it.  And he did say he was going to go to management so nobody ripped them off.  So what is he talking about?  Yeah.  I'm going to go to management to make sure that it's okay and that nobody's ripping me. 
[00:24:00]  You fucking fraud.  With one sentence, he says one thing, and then he completely goes the other way the next sentence.  You like insistent things?  We're doing their program.  But, so, if Heckle and Jekyll, or whatever their names are, you know, if they want me to say I ripped them off, I've ripped you off.  Okay?  Yeah.  Like I've ripped off everybody else in this business, like everybody has ripped me off.  So what their deal is, they've asked their listeners to call me and try to get me all pissed off and hose me and do all that kind of nonsense. 
[00:24:30]  When, you know, we've been hosed for, what, 16, 17 years, and sometimes, you know.  That's pretty impressive.  So I guess he's been out at 17 years, and we've never heard of him.  Never heard of him.  He just sits there in Orlando and hosed for 17 years.  My friend, you've never been hosed like this.  You've never been hosed like this.  This will destroy your show. 
[00:25:00]  You will not be able to carry on a program.  And sometimes, you know, we don't.  We hit the dump button.  Sometimes we let you just go, you know, say whatever you want to because you just make an ass out of yourself while we sit here.  And, you know, put our thumbs in our ears and twist it around.  What?  And like the last caller, or the last two callers, give it your best shot.  Be as quick as you can because you can't beat us. 
[00:25:30]  There's nothing you can do.  Let's see.  We already started affecting your show.  We're pretty much controlling your show now, too.  There you go.  We do our show, and we're now controlling your show.  How does that feel?  There you go.  Fucking asshole.  Hope you did a lot of show prep today.  Hope you got a lot of things to go to besides the phones.  And nothing they can do?  How about being filthy?  That's something they can do.  That will wreck your show.  You won't even be able to go to your own callers because they might screen something filthy at the end. 
[00:26:00]  I guarantee you they're going to start calling people back.  Build up that delay.  Let the delay build up.  You won't be able to take calls while you're building delay.  Oh, it'll be fun.  Lynette, you're on Real Radio.  Oh.  Hi.  Yeah.  This is Lynette with Jim's Love Force.  Very nice.  This is ridiculous.  What is going on today?  Explain it as best I can.  See, we're in complete control of his show where he can't even do a show where one of his stupid listeners is calling and going,  what the hell is going on?  I know you did, but I mean, I heard them talking about it this morning on the Monsters. 
[00:26:30]  I didn't hear anything on Shannon Burke because I guess...  Oh, by the way, the Newsbreakers, they started their thing.  They registered November 9th, 2004.  Oof.  We've been doing the assaults on the media way before that, okay?  We back our stuff up with facts, you asshole.  Facts.  Fucking douchebag.  Monsters, I didn't hear anything on Shannon Burke because I guess they're not on an X-ray.  Yeah, and it's just one of those tired old tricks that guys in radio do from time to time to try to draw attention to themselves, 
[00:27:00]  to regain or expand an audience.  It's the oldest trick in the book.  Okay, so ratings went out.  You know, he already sounds beaten, and this is early in the show.  Oh, I know.  Oh, it's sad.  He has no idea that it has just begun.  Yes, Jimmy.  How many of his callers must be lighting the phone up to do an assault, right?  They must be calling by the dozens.  Well, no, they're all our fans that are calling to comment about the assault yesterday. 
[00:27:30]  Dugouts on the line, Fan Dick, Boston Strangler.  John, these are all regular calls to our show.  All the people that will be very busy later on in the afternoon.  Yeah, they're just getting their rest right now.  And the book.  Okay, so ratings went out today or yesterday or something?  Well, who knows?  No.  These guys, they picked on Howard.  They've gone after a whole bunch.  Yeah, I mean, Elliot in the morning in D.C.  All right, so getting back to what he said earlier, he said he has no idea who we are, right? 
[00:28:00]  Right.  But it seems like he knows a lot of history about us.  Yeah, he contradicts himself a few times.  Another fucking liar in radio.  He listens to the show.  How does he know about the Elliot?  What happened?  Teasing Elliot was like a one-day thing.  How did you know about that?  Well, because he's got XM in his car and he's listening.  Howard listens.  I know for a fact.  Most people in radio have XM satellite radio.  It's just a thing you do.  And, of course, you're spinning around the dial seeing what's going on.  They've picked on Howard.  They've gone after a whole bunch. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I mean, Elliot in the morning in D.C., MJ in Tampa, Howard, of course,  some guy by the name of Mad Max in the Carolinas, Don and Mike.  Mad Max.  I mean, on and on, and now I guess it's our turn.  Now, I don't know how these guys respond to it.  I'm not going to roll over.  I mean, you want to come on?  Come on.  Of course not.  Bring it on.  Yeah, bring it on.  Are they from here or somewhere?  No, they've been on the radio all over the country.  Last gig they had.  All over the country.  I mean, he's continuing with the history of O&A. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  But he doesn't know who we are.  This is why I fucking hate this business.  Bunch of liars that just go on the radio and say whatever the fuck they want.  They can lie through their teeth.  They don't back up anything.  They've been on the radio all over the country.  Last gig they had.  They got fined a huge amount by the FCC.  By the way, guess what?  We didn't have to pay that fine.  Ha ha.  Paid that fine.  And guess what?  We collected every single cent of our contract, you asshole.  How did he know that about you? 
[00:29:30]  How did he know that?  I've never heard of you.  He knows everything about us.  Never heard of us.  Knows everything about us.  Now, by the FCC that got canned out of commercial radio.  You know, they couldn't find a job on a commercial radio station in this country if it had been off the air for 15 years.  So, you know, so they kiss it.  Aside from the ones we were offered that we couldn't take because we were under contract for two years that Infinity wouldn't let us out of.  Except for those jobs. 
[00:30:00]  Including the company that employs you, you asshole.  Oh, God.  I love this.  What a tool.  And let me tell you.  If you have a radio show, you're just allowed to lie.  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  You can lie about anything.  Unbelievable.  And something else this guy doesn't seem to understand.  We've had these before where people call in and just abuse the radio host.  And the next day, we're like, eh, leave him alone.  That was fun. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, it was like, that was fun, but leave him alone.  You know, it's not all that important to tell you the truth that this guy is ripping off a bit or if he's ripping it off or where it came from.  You know something?  That isn't really that important.  It's kind of fun to unleash the hounds and let him bite somebody's ass for a little while.  But the way this guy responded is so arrogant and pompous with all of his bullshit that I will just take great pleasure now in just continuing it.  Letting the guys just wreck this guy's program. 
[00:31:00]  Not even so much for the initial point anymore.  I could give a shit if this guy got on the air and didn't assault on the media.  Who cares?  Because now it's all about the, just, this guy is everything that stinks in radio.  On the air and off the air.  He's everything that sucks cock on the radio.  That's why we take pleasure in taking on all of commercial radio.  Yeah.  All of commercial radio.  Because this is a perfect example of what it's all about.  Guys that go on with their fake voice.  They all sound exactly the same. 
[00:31:30]  I could take it.  Yeah, I'll bring it on.  You know something?  If he didn't go there, we probably would have just said, eh, fuck it.  Not even acknowledge it.  But you want us to bring it on?  You want it?  Here it comes.  Yeah, we're going to bring it on.  And it won't stop.  And we're going to take on all of commercial radio.  That's what we do now.  So you sit there with your fucking nasty hole that's disgusting.  Adding nothing to your program.  Just like every other stupid radio show in America.  Have to have the hole next to you.  Because somebody told you that was a good idea.  To have that next to you. 
[00:32:00]  Ooh.  Radio.  So, you know, so they kiss enough ass.  And I've always said, you kiss enough ass pretty soon.  You're eating.  And they must have kissed enough ass to win themselves a gig on satellite radio.  The fact of the matter is, the numbers aren't coming in.  They're not getting the audience that they promised that they would get.  So what they try to do is utilize.  What is it?  They have an army?  Is that what they call their army?  That fake confusion.  What is that thing? 
[00:32:30]  Is it the army?  Ugh.  You're a hack.  Oh.  Correct, sir.  Yes.  It's bogus.  And so it is so 1980s AM sounding.  We got the army.  It's the, you know, with the heckle and jekyll or the pickle sniffer army or whatever the hell it is.  People easily manipulate and take their orders from, you know, Sniff and Snort or whatever.  Sniff and Snort. 
[00:33:00]  Is he for real?  He's funny, man.  Is he for real?  He's funny.  With Sniff and Snort?  What?  I don't, write it down, Eric.  I can't read lips and do a radio show at the same time.  I know what he's going to say.  What?  No, that's a guess that we can't get to right now.  That's what I'm, yeah.  So reschedule the deal with it.  Because we got to keep that line open because Eric Logan's going to call in to give real facts in a minute here.  Right.  I want some funny stuff, though, man. 
[00:33:30]  Sniff the pickles.  Sniff and Snort.  Oh, is that funny?  But essentially what it comes down to, they say I've ripped off one of their bits.  Which is a bald-faced lie.  Okay, but if they want to hear me say I ripped them off, okay, I ripped them off.  If they want to sleep better tonight.  We hear their web board is all about our show now.  And apparently there's no correct grammar or spelling on the whole thing.  We would correct the grammar, but we've run out of red ink.  Yeah.  That is a little difficult. 
[00:34:00]  That's a little crazy, yeah.  We learned up in the hills.  What is it, a thread?  Don't you get the whole thing?  Excuse me.  We're out of New York.  I don't know.  So anyway, that's all about us.  I mean, that's good.  I don't know computers.  I don't know.  So that's it.  You're making fun of the fact that our fans have bad grammar.  First of all, only a small percentage of them do.  We have bad grammar.  We have bad grammar.  They suck.  Like, that's the best you got?  You got to correct their grammar?  Their grammar. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, it's bad grammar.  Did you hear what the token hole said?  That's a little dicey.  Oh, there's a funny remark.  Thank God she's there to just bring the show up.  It's a little dicey.  Do you even know how useless you are?  Do you even know when you go into work on a daily basis how useless, unnecessary, unfunny,  how detrimental you are to an already lousy program?  You don't even understand that, do you? 
[00:35:00]  How the guys around you really don't want you there.  They fake laugh.  They really don't.  At least Howard's smart enough to, you know, put his in a dunking booth.  Hey, put her in a dunking booth.  Keeps her behind glass.  There's a reason for that.  Because even Howard knows that, you know, Robin kind of is like...  She was there in the beginning so he could get, you know, away with a lot of racial abuse.  Get away with black and women jokes.  But even he was smart enough to just throw her in a dunking booth, you know, where she's  completely separated from the boys. 
[00:35:30]  You think this hole is sitting right next to the guy?  Oh, I'm sure.  Just right next to him.  Oh, now, guys.  Let's not go there.  Oof.  All right.  Can we get Eric Logan on the phone, please?  Here's another bit of audio from the Phillips File.  Phillips File for Wednesday, congratulations to the File XM Satellite Radio,  indicated today that we are the most listened to talk program on satellite services. 
[00:36:00]  What?  No.  No kidding.  When did that come in?  Just now?  Came in...  You've been making this.  No, I wanted to be a surprise to the rest of you.  So congratulations to everybody.  Wow.  The File is now...  ...the officially the most listened to radio broadcast.  Radio broadcast, non-music radio broadcast on XM Satellite Radio.  Another blatant lie.  With their bad acting.  Another...  Really?  When did this come in? 
[00:36:30]  Oh!  The numbers.  Oh!  When did this...  Really?  Well, that's just great.  Oh.  When do you think maybe we should take ratings to the program director?  Fucking liar.  Yuck.  Oh.  I got a secret.  I got a secret.  I got a secret.  Oh.  Jim Phillips, you're not a funny guy.  Oh.  I'm not even trying to be malicious.  Some people are funny. 
[00:37:00]  Some people are not.  He is so far away from funny.  Dude.  Sniffle and snort.  Hey.  All right.  Now, that was funny.  Well, heckle and jekyll, I thought, was like a little bit below the belt.  How do you recover from that?  And then making fun of our listeners with the banjo sound.  That's great.  Well...  I don't know how we can compete against that.  We are based out of New York.  There are a lot of hillbillies out here.  They picked on Howard Stern.  They picked on...  Picked on your fucking 50-year-old man. 
[00:37:30]  Stop.  Picked on.  We're trying to get Eric Logan on the phone here.  Jim, your turn.  You're on real radio.  Hey, Jim.  You always talk about stupid people.  With this Jekyll and Hyde group up there, how smart is it business-wise to send your listeners  to the number one show on XM, aren't you losing anybody that you had left once they listen  to us?  That's a good point.  Yeah, whatever.  Well, that's true.  You know, it just doesn't make sense.  You've got to lose whatever you had left.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:38:00]  We call them Jekyll.  Why?  If a woman's in the studio, you should be saying, wow, I didn't think a cucumber went  in that far.  That's what women should be doing on radio.  Holy shit.  She chimes up now, and me and Jimmy just look at each other and go,  Like, the clip is playing.  She says one word, which is, yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Shut up.  That you had left once they listened to us?  That's a good point.  Yeah, whatever.  Well, that's true. 
[00:38:30]  Well, that's true.  It's twat from Munaki.  That's true.  Oh, good gosh.  The penguin.  Yeah, believe me.  It just doesn't make sense.  It's fine sending our listeners over to listen to you.  It's fine.  XM152.  If you want to spend your afternoon listening to this guy, because it will just make our  listeners appreciate this program that much more, because you stink. 
[00:39:00]  You are so bad.  I was listening, because I was laughing my ass off at the callers, and then I guess he  couldn't go to the phones anymore, so he had to do a show.  I heard a conversation, Opie, about juggling.  They went off talking about juggling.  Unbelievable.  Did you hear the quiz show section?  I was hoping someone would get through.  I guess they screened the shit out of those calls. 
[00:39:30]  They did.  You want to talk about unfunny, awful radio?  They do a quiz show.  It was kind of like The Price is Right, where he's just guessing dates and years.  What is fucking funny about that?  Yeah.  Who's laughing at that?  I think the format was a Win Ben Stein's Money format, where they have somebody, under  some timed thing, they have a clock running, has to answer questions, and then somebody  from the show has to answer questions, and whoever gets closest to the right answer.  That's Win Ben Stein's Money, is pretty much it. 
[00:40:00]  And if you're still doing that type of radio in 2005, just please shoot yourself.  Could you just shoot yourself?  Spare everybody?  We've got to play this clip again, and then I'm going right to XM Headquarters after this  little clip here, because we back up our stuff with facts.  Jim, your turn.  You're on real radio.  Hey, Jim.  You always talk about stupid people.  With this Jekyll and Hyde group up there, how smart is a group of guys to send your listeners 
[00:40:30]  to the number one show on XM?  Aren't you losing anybody that you had left once they listened to us?  That's a good point.  Yeah, whatever.  Well, that's true.  You know, it just doesn't make sense.  You're going to lose whatever you had left.  It doesn't matter.  You call them Jekyll and Hyde instead of heckle and Jekyll.  I've got a contract.  Even if I have two listeners or no listeners, I still get paid.  It doesn't make any difference to me.  And to answer his question about why we haven't been calling, I'm sure a lot of the listeners  are like me.  We've been sending Otto saying, shut these morons up. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, getting tons of emails.  Exactly.  Get these guys off our air.  I don't doubt he was getting tons of email.  All right.  So here's the deal.  Phillip says he's the number one non-music show on XM Satellite Radio, right?  Made a big deal about that in the last couple of years.  And that we are floundering.  And that we are floundering and we're not getting any listeners.  And the company is very upset with our performance.  So why don't we get to the bottom of it?  Who do we got?  The guy that works in the mailroom up down there in Washington? 
[00:41:30]  No, XM.  Who do we got?  We got somebody that works in the lunchroom.  Somebody that heard from a secretary somewhere.  Who do we got?  We got Eric Logan.  I don't even know what his title is officially.  Let me ask him.  Eric Logan?  Yo, baby.  What is your official title at XM Satellite Radio?  I am the chief haircut designer.  We know that.  Dude, I got a new dude.  Come on.  Every time I go to the house, I have a complex.  I got people mocking me at the dance salon.  Nice hair, Elo. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Besides your haircut, what else do you do?  Well, my job is to make sure that all of our subscribers are happy with their monthly  subscriptions.  So I'm in charge of all the programming across every channel.  All the content, all the content deals, sports, news talk, music, personalities, also kind  of oversee all the broadcast stops to the people that actually work down on the second floor  and make sure that the audio gets to the satellites and the radios work and everything else.  So now, if there's somebody in that building that would know if there's any way, shape, 
[00:42:30]  or form to tell how good a certain show is doing, that would be you.  That would be me.  You would know, being the head of the program.  And I actually, the guy who kind of signs the checks, actually pays the people to go out  and find out that sort of data.  All right.  So let me ask you the question.  Is Jim Phillips the number one non-music show on XM Satellite Radio?  Who?  Oh, Jesus.  How?  Jim Phillips file. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  To Jim Phillips, your boss doesn't even know who you are.  Yeah, it's, you know, I'll have to look.  I mean, it's not right here.  It's not right on this top page here.  Oh, God damn.  I'll have to.  So you've got actual ratings in front of you.  Yeah, but, I mean, we don't break it down by show.  I mean, again, it's really about, you know, how people are satisfied with the channel.  And, you know, I'm sorry.  I'm being distracted.  I'm trying to find it.  So there's no way Jim Phillips is the number one non-music show on XM, right? 
[00:43:30]  I can confidently tell you, not a prayer.  Not even a chance.  So this guy is just blatantly lying to his listeners, to his co-host Hole, and to himself, obviously.  Well, and the other thing, too, to be, you know, because, again, we don't lie on the show.  But we really don't disclose a lot of that information for a lot of reasons.  I mean, there's very competitive reasons.  We've got a competitor in our space that copies every goddamn thing that we do.  You know, so I don't want to, like, give away a lot of data.  But I can assure you this, that for a non-music channel, he is not the number one rated show. 
[00:44:00]  And certainly not the number one rated channel.  And not even close, right?  Not even close would be another very accurate statement as well.  Is he in the top 140?  Well, I think he does actually beat the traffic and weather channels, yes.  Oh, okay.  Congratulations to that, Jim.  Yeah.  I mean, he does have higher ratings than that.  So that's...  Props for that one.  And, well, here's something that a lot of the commercial radio douches like to point out, 
[00:44:30]  that they think that Anthony and I are failing on XM Satellite Radio.  Completely failing.  We're desperate.  That's why you guys had to take us off the premium channel.  Well, that was going to be my point, listening to the whole thing.  It's like, if the show is such a failure, why did all of a sudden, did we take it off the  premium channel and, you know, make such a big deal about it?  Why, you know, why did we do those sort of things?  And why would we, if the show was so controversial and so horrible, you know, why did we go to  all the trouble of giving you a channel and put you on 24 hours a day, seven days a week? 
[00:45:00]  And why did we take it off the...  I mean, it's just, it's nonsense.  You know what my favorite is, is when people say, or they actually said when we first signed  on with XM and we were on a premium channel, people said we're on a premium channel because  we can't get listeners.  So whatever listeners we do have, they want them paying for it.  And then when we got taken off the premium, the same people were saying the reason they're  taking off a premium is because they have no listeners. 
[00:45:30]  Isn't it one or the other?  Yeah, it usually is.  But that's what they do.  I mean, look, the fact of the matter is, this is arguably the most popular national  radio show, and it's only going to continue to grow.  I mean, the thing about it is, is if you're working in terrestrial radio, you do not have  a growth story that is pure and simple, period.  And just think about the simple math, and I'll use even numbers so that people who aren't  really good math people, if you have a, if 10% of your total people who subscribe to 
[00:46:00]  the service listen to you, and you have 100 people, you have 10 people, but when it goes  to a million, it goes to 100,000.  Then when it goes to 4 million, and as our subscribers continue to ramp, even if the same  percentage of people continue to listen to you, guess what happens?  The listeners go up.  Exactly.  The amount of actual listeners, even if the percentage is the same.  Right, Elo?  Absolutely, Ant.  You've got it.  Oh, I feel so smart.  So let's get to the bottom of this.  Is the Opie and Anthony show a success on XM Satellite Radio? 
[00:46:30]  Huge.  Bigger than I, or probably anybody, would have expected at this stage.  Thank you, Elo.  Look at that.  See, unlike the Philz file, we back up our shit with facts.  With the guy that knows.  And can we talk about the little secret that you told me the other day?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  But I do want to say thank you to Brandon Miller and many, many pests who started emailing  me around 6.30 last night.  Ah, people wanted to know the truth. 
[00:47:00]  Well, no, it's actually what they were doing.  My emails, and actually one of them is from Brandon that says, from the pest, and they're  giving me his number and telling me to actually go in, call him, tell him he's full of shit  and try to work in a patent battle reference is what he's doing.  I mean, what radio show has, you know, I'm supposed to be the ogre.  I'm supposed to be like pig virus, right?  I'm like the guy that every personality is supposed to hate.  And here are the listeners calling me and emailing me, defending me to some guy in Florida. 
[00:47:30]  I've got to be honest, I hate the fact that we like you.  I know.  I hate it.  It is a little awkward.  We love hating our bosses, but for some reason, I don't know, you kind of get it, and it stinks  that you do.  Elo, location check, where are you?  Look, I'm in my office.  Oh, okay.  Well, I could picture you there sitting there.  And Elo, is it also true that Anthony and I and Jimmy will have a say in future talk programming? 
[00:48:00]  Absolutely.  On especially 202 and other channels on XM.  Without a doubt.  Other channels on XM, right?  Thank you.  Well, I'm going to cross up the Phillips file.  Why?  Put in the pedal instead.  Jim Phillips, you're a really smart guy.  God, this is the future of radio, and you're messing with us.  What a douche.  The monsters, I'm going to say, are still on the fence.  Still on the fence.  Don and Mike, not a chance.  Hold on, I'm going through my checklist. 
[00:48:30]  Don and Mike, not a chance.  Lex and Terry, eh-eh.  Nah.  Who else do you guys want to say no to?  Ron and Fez, a definite yes.  Scott Farrell, a definite yes.  BJ Shea in Seattle, yes.  Shannon Burke.  Shannon Burke.  Eh-eh-eh.  Sorry, Shannon.  How about Dick Purton?  Ooh, who's that?  Well, he's an oldies guy in Detroit.  Just not throw it out.  All right, I like him.  You know, because XM is the home of oldies.  You know, the 50s are alive on XM.  The 50s are alive on XM, Elo. 
[00:49:00]  Well, thank you for that information, Elo.  I am here.  I'm a cornucopia of information for you and the pests.  Yes, you are.  Elo, do we have any big deals going down with XM Satellite Radio?  Yes, we do.  And what are they?  Oh, you stink.  The guy...  He gets up early.  Gets up early.  Why?  He spews his facts and you hang up on him.  You just picture him in his office with his feet kicked off, all nicely coiffed. 
[00:49:30]  Feeling all good about himself.  He's bonding with the boys.  And then slam!  Did you see that picture of him, that promo shot he's got?  It's like a take-it from the ceiling.  Yeah, he's got his feet up.  He's got his sweater on.  He's relaxing.  Wait till the pests get the picture of your publicity shot and Photoshop the hell out of that one.  Well, there you go.  See, we back up our stuff with facts whenever we can, Mr. Phillips.  And according to the guy who should know, you're not even on the radar. 
[00:50:00]  So why are you lying?  Well, dude, honestly...  Why are you lying?  And I think the pests today should ask him why he's lying.  Yeah.  And then when he tries to deny that, go,  but didn't you hear your own boss on Opie and Anthony this morning?  Of course you did.  You're listening live right now, aren't you, Mr. Phillips?  He's not listed anywhere.  I looked through the channel guide to see maybe he's a big deal and I just didn't notice it.  No one knows you're on, dude.  That phone call is going to really hurt.  That's got to sting.  On so many levels, Mr. Phillips. 
[00:50:30]  It's got to sting.  Number one...  How bummed are you right now, Mr. Phillips?  Working all those years and you're not even on the radar.  And this is the future of radio.  Everyone knows it.  Oh, commercial radio likes to trash satellite all the time.  But the reality is this is the future.  And you're not going to be part of it if we have anything to do with it.  But, you know, is Elo in the position where he would know something like the channels  and how well they're doing and the shows and how well they're doing?  What was he again?  Oh, that's right. 
[00:51:00]  He's the head of all programming.  What an ass.  Oh, my God.  Did you think you were going to get away with lying like that about our show?  Just in case people maybe didn't hear what Mr. Phillips said on his show yesterday.  Phillips filed for a Wednesday.  Congratulations to the File XM satellite radio.  Indicated today that we are the most listened to talk program on satellite services.  What?  Shut up!  No.  No kidding. 
[00:51:30]  When did that come in?  Just now?  Came in.  You've been hiding this.  When did it happen?  Well, I wanted it to be a surprise to the rest of you.  So, congratulations to everybody.  Wow.  The File is now the most listened to radio broadcast, non-music radio broadcast on XM satellite radio.  There you go.  But Elo is just talking to the boys.  You're a worthless piece of shit.  There you go.  Another radio host just lying through his teeth and trying to get away with it. 
[00:52:00]  Number one.  Really?  But we backed it up with the guy that knows exactly what's going on with the talk programming.  Dude, that acting was atrocious.  Oh, when did that happen?  It was like watching Vos play five parts in an Eddie Murphy film.  Yeah.  Huh?  Us?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  There you go.  There you go.  Calling Bravo Sierra on you, my friend.  I actually feel bad for the guy that he's lying that badly.  Did he think we'd just sit here and not call him out on that? 
[00:52:30]  And not do our research?  It's all backed up here on this show.  Fucking loser.  It's all backed up like Opie's lower intestine.  It's all backed up.  It's all backed up.  I've been dumping better lately.  You have?  Sure.  All right.  You want to hear some more of this stuff?  Please.  Please.  1-888-978-1041.  In the metro, 407-916-1041. 
[00:53:00]  For those of you who normally listen to you scratching your head and say, what the hell is this all about?  Oh, they're coming out of the woodwork today.  Well, the fact of the matter, there are two guys that got kicked off of commercial radio because they didn't have enough talent to stay on commercial radio.  Ah, now it's not about us getting kicked off because we couldn't adhere to the rules, which he said earlier.  And because we got kicked off because we were too dirty.  Now it's we didn't have enough talent?  Another lie.  Another fine lie.  Because when you do radio, you can just lie.  You can just make up shit as you go along. 
[00:53:30]  The reality is, whether you liked us or hated us, we were completely successful in commercial radio.  Syndicated across America.  And syndicated.  Syndicated across America, it's about 20 stations.  And on most of those stations, we were number one in the demo we were hired to be number one in.  Men 18 of 49.  You can look it up.  You can look it up.  Yep.  It's part of the permanent record of radio.  Readily available.  You fucking asshole.  The fact is, we got kicked off radio because we got stupid one day. 
[00:54:00]  But that had nothing to do with how talented we were.  To stay on commercial radio.  They got a gig on satellite radio.  So now, and what they, you know, they pull out the oldest trick in the book by trying  to get their two or three listeners or members of the audience, what they call, to get their  names mentioned on the other radio stations.  They did it with Howard.  I thought it was Ted.  They've done it with him.  They did it with NJ and Camper.  And so now they accuse me.  It's our turn.  They accuse me of trying to rip them off. 
[00:54:30]  It's our turn.  I get it.  No one's listening to the program.  Two or three.  Well, that's two or three listeners.  Sure did get through a whole lot on your program yesterday.  Oof.  And they're very creative.  They all had about 20 names apiece.  Two or three phone-owning motherfuckers.  Or say that I'm ripping off one of their bits.  Okay.  I'm ripping off one of their bits.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I don't give a rat's ass.  No, you know you are, Jim.  So now they call and I said, do the best job you can do.  As a matter of fact, I have more listeners than the individuals that you're referring to. 
[00:55:00]  I've got the highest rated non-music program on XM Satellite Radio.  Doesn't that make you uncomfortable now to hear that?  Yeah.  After we just took the call from Eric Logan?  Doesn't that just make you uncomfortable?  You're not even on the radar as far as that's concerned.  You're not even close.  You can't even lie because you're close to it.  You're not even close.  You're completely off the radar.  And we've got a lot of his fans listening today. 
[00:55:30]  And they're probably cringing.  They're probably cringing like, oh my God, we believed in this guy.  He was the head of all programming.  The head of all programming at XM Satellite Radio.  Calling you out on this.  Called you out on it.  Stop.  And I got a little secret.  Oh.  What's the secret?  A little secret.  What channel are they on?  152.  152.  There you go.  Yeah, listen to that.  Does the secret rhyme with Fandwith? 
[00:56:00]  As a matter of fact, I have more listeners than the individuals that you're referring to.  I've got the highest rated non-music program on XM Satellite Radio.  I'm all over the world.  I've got the number one ratings in Central Florida.  It's been that way for 15 years.  And what difference does it make whether they would have more listeners or not?  It doesn't make any difference to me.  Unfunny cunt next to you?  Because guess what?  The place that you're talking about, there are other people that have more listeners than them. 
[00:56:30]  They've been trying to rip off Howard for year after year.  Oh, that'll take.  Year after year.  And it still didn't work.  If you want to call and take your best shot, nuzzle up to Howard.  That'll help you.  Howard doesn't give a fuck about you, you asshole.  You're not going as serious either.  Shot like this last guy.  Bring it on.  You know, if you want to, you know, if you're a female caller, want to sound like a man or vice versa, you can do that as well.  But, you know, you can't do a joke because, you know, it doesn't work. 
[00:57:00]  Or if you want to call me, you know, just, I'm inviting you to bring it on.  These other guys, they probably tell their producers and their screeners, don't let these guys on.  I don't want to hear from these guys.  I want you to come on because I can take you on.  Well, it's bitch out.  Exactly.  All right, you guys heard that.  So it's the Phillips File, 3 to 7 p.m. on the East Coast.  The phone number, 888-978-1041 or 407-916-1041.  The Army, or what we like to call them, the PES, are organizing as we speak on whackbag.com. 
[00:57:30]  And also opanthony.net.  Yeah.  Getting involved in this one.  There's another website that someone made, boringdouche.com.  Douche is a D-O-U-C-H-E.  Boringdouche.com.  And I guess it's in its infancy right now.  It's a picture of Phillips.  And there's another gentleman next to him.  That's all I'll say.  Just...  Ooh.  It's a visual, folks. 
[00:58:00]  You're going to have to check it out for yourself.  He looks like a neighbor that, like, chases you off his lawn.  He doesn't...  Hey!  He doesn't really dress like that, does he?  Yeah.  Eek.  He's wearing slacks up to his nipples.  He doesn't really dress like that, does he?  That's how he dresses?  That's not Photoshop.  No.  Boy.  I think I've got to start listening to this guy.  He's the type of guy I've got to listen to. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's just not a funny guy, man.  It's kind of sad to listen to somebody desperately trying to be, like, the funny guy with the  cutting references.  You ever see him at parties and stuff?  Oh.  The guys that kind of think they're funny.  And it's sad because other people are being entertaining.  Whether they're being funny or just interesting with conversation.  And then there's the guy that just doesn't have it.  And he's trying to talk.  And everyone kind of looks at him and kind of nods.  He gets through what he says.  And then they turn around back to the interesting guy or the funny guy.  That's who you are. 
[00:59:00]  Dude, I had dinner last night just with a guy, some friends.  And a guy who I just met was just a funny dude, man.  He's like one of those old school Italian guys.  Just a funny fucking guy just talking to you.  And, like, one of those guys that you think that this guy's a fucking sociopath and ten  minutes later you're rolling because he's a funny, obnoxious, Robert Lozier-like fucking  dude.  Yeah.  That's what a funny guy is.  Just a guy that you can talk to and listen to and keep you entertained.  This fucking guy I couldn't listen to for 30 seconds and he has a radio show. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  He's awful.  Once again, Anthony, it just went down on our program.  Elo.  All right, so let me ask you the question.  Is Jim Phillips the number one non-music show on XM Satellite Radio?  Who?  Who?  I can assure you this, that for a non-music channel, he is not the number one rated show.  And certainly not the number one rated channel.  Well, there you go.  Bill, you're on real radio.  Oh, here we go.  What is it?  The Opie and Anthony what? 
[01:00:00]  Army.  Army?  Army.  What?  Fordick, we're doing it.  Remember 400 years ago when you did the revolution?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Well, that's what it is.  They ripped you off.  General opening?  They ripped you off.  Opie and General Anthony.  Oh, you ripped me off.  The revolution.  They ripped you off.  Do that reporting for duty, sir.  11 years ago.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  You were the connor.  I'm Sergeant Schmuck.  What can I do for you today?  Oh, my lady.  That's very cool.  The Opie and Anthony Army.  That's very nice. 
[01:00:30]  Who are you?  Oh, my word.  I'm the minister of morons.  I'm Carpool Douchebag with the Opie and Anthony Army.  Did you hear her contribution?  Yep.  The minister of morons.  And you can actually show your face in public and tell people that?  She did not say the minister of morons.  That's what a woman does.  Maybe about 10 seconds.  I want to go further.  Good almighty.  That's very cool.  The Opie and Anthony Army. 
[01:01:00]  That's very nice.  Who are you?  I'm the minister of morons.  I'm Carpool Douchebag with the Opie and Anthony Army.  You dumb whore.  Minister is not an army physician.  And you can actually.  What?  I'm a minister of third class.  Holy shit.  Minister of.  It just goes.  You know.  It just goes to show you.  It's everything we talk about on the show.  You are everything bad with radio. 
[01:01:30]  Everything.  A woman trying to do a military riff.  And this dumb box comes out with minister.  At least he had the common decency to make an unfunny joke that had a rank to it.  The minister of morons.  Eminem.  That would have been funny in school.  Hey.  What do you think honey?  This is what you should go.  You get this.  And you can actually show your face in public and tell people that. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I got a membership card too.  It's the Phillips file.  Oh.  And then into more commercials.  They actually walk around with Opie and Anthony Pest t-shirts you ass.  The army thing is more of a joke.  The Pest thing is not a joke.  That's a nightmare.  Yeah.  That you're going to start feeling every day.  The scariest part?  We didn't come up with the Opie and Anthony army.  We didn't come up with it.  It wasn't a promotional thing that we made sweepers for like he probably did back in the day. 
[01:02:30]  You know.  It wasn't one of those things.  Hey.  You could join our army.  Because that's the only reference point.  Back in the day when he wasn't wearing slacks to do his radio show.  The only reference point this guy has are those hack bits.  It's like he probably imagines we go on the air and go sign up to be in the Opie and Anthony army right now.  We'll send out a membership card.  You can increase your rank the more you call in.  No.  These freaks made this up themselves.  They do it themselves which is more frightening than anything. 
[01:03:00]  They're relentless.  And you can welcome them to your program on a daily basis you tool.  Don't be such a minister of morons.  Oh.  Stop it.  I'll say hi to Doug Out Doug from whackbag.com.  One of the generals of the OAP Army.  Oh yes general.  Hey general.  Self appointed general.  They loved that part though.  Yes they did.  These guys were number one.  We don't know whether or not they hate you guys or not because you make us listen to these fucking idiots for a whole four hour show. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah that was painful.  Oh god these guys are horrible.  But I think today I was really trying to do it yesterday afternoon after the fifth call I think I got through.  So I really want to start working on her because she is a fucking parrot that just sits there and repeats everything everybody says.  I really want to see if she knows how to handle herself at all.  He didn't.  It was very obvious that he didn't because everybody started kicking his ass. 
[01:04:00]  Let's be honest.  Some of us aren't the most intelligent guys out there.  You know the ONA listeners.  At least we get through.  We pester.  That's what we're there for.  Some of us definitely got duped out by this guy but others didn't.  I heard one guy trip up so bad he just went oh I stink.  Oh the punching out guy we got him.  He was horrid.  He dropped out on everybody that had him on the ropes.  You did a great job Doug.  You had him.  You asked him a question.  He could not answer it. 
[01:04:30]  It totally confused him.  You could hear him mumbling and stuttering.  And then he says bring it and he proceeds to dump out on everybody.  Doug you seem to be one of the more intelligent listeners.  You've got to call him today and ask him if he has a comment about what Eric Logan said on our show today.  He's nowhere near the number one non-music program or whatever the hell he said on XM.  Okay?  Of course we're going to get that through today.  What channel are they on?  152?  152.  And I know a lot of his listeners are listening right now. 
[01:05:00]  You've got to feel kind of bad for your hero.  That he's just lying to you like that.  He has to make himself feel good so he comes up with fake facts.  Tune in on channel 152 today.  The Opie and Anthony show will be on from 3 to 7 p.m.  We're back in afternoon drive, guys.  We're back in afternoon drive.  All right.  Doug, hold on the line a second because I want to play your call to the Philips file yesterday.  Here's Doug out Doug getting through.  Doug, you're on Real Radio.  What's going on, Jim?  I am Doug out Doug.  I am the Opie and Anthony general of the army. 
[01:05:30]  General of the army.  You're darn right.  First off, Jim, please, let me get this through.  I will not call you a name or swear.  I want to get that out there for everybody so when you dump out on me, when you start looking.  Well, how do you know I'm going to dump out on you, number one?  Why would you even say something like that?  I said, call me.  You called.  I'm giving you an opportunity to talk.  Sir, you've dumped out on me three times today.  I'm the heavy breathing guy.  I haven't sworn yet.  Now, can I ask you, if you're number one in these ratings, can you tell me why for two hours 
[01:06:00]  not a single call has gotten through from one of your fans?  What are you talking about?  We're not putting them on.  I'm not putting anything on.  All right.  That was someone blurting something out to try to cover up and doing very badly.  Like you're in a bad situation.  Someone's got you on the ropes and you're like, we didn't want to take any calls.  You didn't want to take calls from your own listeners.  Is that what you're saying?  What kind of show do you do?  What the fuck?  Another lie.  More bullshit.  Our listeners get through first and then we'll deal with other people. 
[01:06:30]  That's how it is in radio.  You weren't putting your own listeners through on your own radio show?  What the fuck does that mean?  He didn't expect that question.  Well, maybe today he'll put them through.  That's what'll happen.  Today he'll put them through.  No, the fact is he was so done.  The fact is we completely took over his program.  They just didn't want to go to the phones at all.  Look for more of it today.  Anything on.  We're not putting anybody on.  Why?  You're not putting any real callers on, so you're purposely putting Opie and Anthony fans on? 
[01:07:00]  No, I'm allowing those fans to call if you want to.  I mean, I don't understand.  I'm allowing those fans.  I don't.  And despite that, and just.  You don't have a single call from one of your fans.  Get it out of your system, will you?  No, I'm asking a question.  I'm not being.  It's not your program.  I'm asking you.  Get it out of your system.  Two hours.  You've not had a single call.  So what difference does it make to you?  What?  It doesn't make any difference whether I dumped out on everybody or nobody.  I don't understand your point.  What you did wrong was.  What you did wrong was.  Yes, you do.  Oh, yes.  You went on the air. 
[01:07:30]  You claimed that you started a bit because you're a small market guy.  It got out nationwide.  You don't know the ratings.  You don't know anything about ratings or the business.  The fact of the matter.  Now, the fact of the matter.  Well, I'm going to put you on hold because you're, you know, I mean.  I don't listen.  Yeah, you won't listen.  I offer you the opportunity to listen and then respond, but you don't want to do that.  The fact of the matter is I have more listeners in Central Florida than those two guys have on satellite radio.  The fact of the matter is on satellite radio, I have a hundred times more listeners than they do. 
[01:08:00]  Am I back on it?  Not anymore.  Oh, he has a hundred times more listeners.  But we just had the guy that is in charge of all programming for XM Satellite Radio saying that it's not even a chance.  It's not even close.  Right.  Unfunny, fraud, and a liar.  Like, Doug calls in.  How do you allow a caller to just school you like that with facts?  Oh, he nailed him.  The guy was confused.  He stammered. 
[01:08:30]  And then he said he doesn't understand your point.  And meanwhile, your point was so clear.  Yeah.  There was nothing to not understand with your point.  Where's your fans?  I don't know what you mean.  What are your points?  I don't understand.  What's confusing about that question, Jimbo?  But he has short-term memory, too.  Because he wasn't going to us initially.  He was trying to get around us.  He wasn't taking our calls.  I actually felt bad for the girl that was screening the calls.  She was getting her ass kicked by us and by them. 
[01:09:00]  There was a call I had made as Mike calling about the SeaWorld thing they were talking about in Williamsburg, Virginia.  So I was making up some bullshit.  And they actually dumped out on me when I was in the middle of the serious part of the call.  So I called back.  She's like, can you please just promise me you're not one of them?  The screener's begging.  She was like, because I'm getting in a lot of trouble.  No, no.  I just wanted to talk about SeaWorld. 
[01:09:30]  So I was like two seconds in.  I think that's the one I called him, a freaking ass clown.  Yeah.  Or a freaking clown or something like that.  I actually didn't say fuck.  Someone thought I said fuck, but I didn't say fuck.  Because I didn't want to get dumped out on because I had a lot for the guy.  But she was terrified because they were hammering on her.  So he can't say that he wanted to get calls from us.  That's absolute bullshit itself.  He had no choice, so he went with it.  So you've got to give him a little for that.  All right.  But he had nothing.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Great job, man.  We look forward to your future calls, by the way. 
[01:10:00]  This is hysterical.  I know.  You got this?  Yeah, let me get right back into this.  He started his program by saying that he got the idea.  This is where this all started about the assault on the media thing, from a New York Times  article, and he has no idea who Opie and Anthony are.  We heard that, right?  Yep.  Am I making anything up?  Nope.  Thank you.  We hold in our hands the New York Times article he's referring to.  Now, Opie, when you get to this, obviously our names must be buried in the middle of  the article somewhere, and perhaps he just skimmed.  So why don't we give him the benefit of the doubt, right? 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Maybe he didn't read the whole article.  Maybe there was a mention, I don't know, way deep in the article.  Maybe that's because I'm looking at three pages here.  Maybe our name comes up once in a paragraph toward the end of the article.  See, Mr. Phillips, that's why we're a much more popular radio show, because there's a  big-time honesty on this program.  We just don't sit here and lie through our teeth.  And without further ado, I read from the top of the article where he stated on his own  show, this is the article that gave him the idea, and he doesn't know who Opie and Anthony 
[01:11:00]  are.  As soon as he heard about the Arthur Cheehan incident last month, in which, at the end  of a live report, that WCBS-TV reporter in New York was caught on camera cursing out a  prankster sent by the Opie and Anthony satellite radio show.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's in the first sentence?  It's the first sentence.  Wait, we pop up in the first sentence of the article where you got the idea to do the  assault on the media, where you also state that you have no idea who Opie and Anthony 
[01:11:30]  are.  Chris Landon, 33, and his fellow newsbreakers jumped online to find the video.  A group devoted to monkey-wrenching live reports on local news, the newsbreakers have a standing  interest in media mishaps.  But in this case, their interest was personal.  Just a month before, an Opie and Anthony producer had approached him about joining in  its assault campaign of on-air stunts.  And now one of those stunts, staged by one of the show's interns, had cost Mr. Cheehan  his job.  We looked at each other, Mr. Landon recalled, and said, that could have been us. 
[01:12:00]  Us.  Right.  There you go.  And the article continues.  But the point I'm trying to make is Opie and Anthony mentioned in the first sentence  and then mentioned again in the second paragraph.  Maybe he starts from the middle of the article and skims down.  That's the way most of us read.  And he also states that these newsbreaker guys were doing this way before we did.  And that's just a blatant lie, too.  I'm sorry.  We got a website, opiananthony.com, that has video going back years.  Years.  This guy, yeah, he's just, he's everything that stinks about radio, radio personality. 
[01:12:30]  And that's why we take on all commercial radio.  Bring it on, motherfuckers.  We hate you all.  We got fucked by commercial radio, and we're going to shove it right back in your ass now.  Yep.  We hate you all.  Minister of morons.  Right.  Ooh, you told him.  Yeah.  I'm not holding back anymore.  All right, here we go.  Now it gets interesting.  Now I hear some more of our listeners getting through to his program.  We played this earlier, but let's play it again.  Grady, you're on real radio. 
[01:13:00]  I hear him.  It's his respirator.  Why would you dump out of that?  Here we go.  Oh, Grady.  Can't have that.  Oh, dump it, dump it.  And then she goes, we can't have that.  He's having fun with it.  You hear the panic in his voice when he said, dump it, dump it.  That's going to be all day today, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Saturday, Wednesday.  She said you can't have that.  It must have been a funny remark. 
[01:13:30]  Your show stinks.  Mike, your turn.  Hey, what's going on?  Talk to us.  Hey, I was actually on before.  I started talking about the SeaWorld.  They were trying to get them down here in Virginia Beach for a while because we had a lot more land and there wouldn't be as much issues.  But apparently they were afraid to do it down here also because of the eminent domain.  Everybody seems to be afraid of that, just like you're afraid of Opie and Anthony, you freaking clown.  He's angry. 
[01:14:00]  Why are you so angry?  What's the matter with you, sir?  Man alive.  Did you hear him?  Man alive.  And his voice is, I don't understand.  No, you clown.  You effing clown.  Look, go figure.  I mean, man, when you get that angry, a little anger management might help out.  They have no life.  Check your life priorities there.  Really?  And he had to call back a second time?  I'm just so angry about that, you effing clown.  I'm just so pissed off because they said you ripped off one of their bits, and I am just so angry about that. 
[01:14:30]  Is that where he's calling from, Virginia Beach?  Is that all they got to offer up in Virginia Beach?  Or are they torqued off because I've got more listeners than them on satellite radio?  Hey, don't get so torqued off.  Yeah.  And once again saying he has more listeners than us, and we had Elo on this morning proving that that's not true there, Mr. Phillips.  Because I've got more listeners than them on satellite radio.  Is that the deal with the information came in, and now they're all bent out of shape of itself? 
[01:15:00]  Well, I ripped you off.  He's totally flustered.  Get a lawyer.  This is just the beginning.  He didn't even do anything.  It doesn't matter.  It's news bluster.  Well, just say I ripped you off.  All right.  I said I ripped you off.  Get yourself a lawyer.  All right.  Sue me.  All right.  See you at the deposition.  What a budget.  What?  You know, I've got news for you.  The lowest thing that anybody in radio can do, the lowest thing, and everybody in radio knows it, is to pick on other guys. 
[01:15:30]  We're not part of regular radio, you fuckhead.  And the lowest thing a radio guy can do, by the way.  Everyone knows it.  You know what?  I don't give a fuck what everyone knows in radio.  You're a fraternity of douchebags, and we hate you all.  Is to pick on other guys in radio.  It's the last resort bit.  That's what his name is.  The last resort bit.  That's the name of it.  But Eric Logan was just on our show saying that we're a huge success for XM so far.  Well, my friend.  Yes, Jimmy.  The last resort is to hire an unfunny joke box with tits. 
[01:16:00]  That's the last resort.  That's the lowest thing in radio, stupid.  She barely has boobs.  She barely has a body.  They had to get, like, some kind of glamour shot together and throw her in some kind of almost sexy outfit to hide her fatness.  Is she fat?  Fatness, saggy boobs, saggy face.  They call it the last resort bit.  Well, enjoy the last resort bit for as long as it takes. 
[01:16:30]  Because you're going to be experiencing what you call the last resort bit today and tomorrow, et cetera, et cetera.  And then they get stupid callers who don't know any better to fall for it.  Say, okay, I'm really mad.  Mono-y-mono with Techland Jekyll or Billy and Bob or whatever their names are.  I really show them.  Your dupes is what you are.  You've been manipulated, you bunch of dumbasses.  It's the Phillips file on real radio. 
[01:17:00]  They eat this shit up.  It's not about duping.  We make a suggestion.  They take it to heart.  These pests will destroy you.  This isn't about somebody being duped.  They enjoy this shit.  This is fun for them.  Let's go to the evil trucker.  Evil trucker, real fast.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Jimmy, you little muggle.  Hey.  I've got a question for you. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know if anybody's pointed it out yet, but it seems like everybody on 152 has messed with you guys in some shape or form or fashion.  Well, there's a theme there, and that will be taken care of.  Mark my words.  Mark my words.  You just stay tuned on the 152 situation.  You just stay tuned.  That's all I'm going to say right now.  I would love to say more, but I promise you, Lo, I'll shut my mouth.  My partner, Angry Trucker, and I, we were wanting this to tell you.  152, mark my words, we'll get much better. 
[01:18:00]  Much better.  Hey, Ope.  Yeah.  Since you're the guy that's in charge of the channel, 202.  I'm not in charge of the channel.  Me and my partner, Angry Trucker, we was wanting to see if we could find out about how we could apply to get on as DJ.  He's there.  We don't know jack shit about the radio business, but we figured y'all could school us and mold us and turn us into something good.  Here's the deal.  I guarantee, Anthony and I are working on it as we speak.  We're going to build 202 in the very near future. 
[01:18:30]  We're going to start adding more shows and stuff.  So if you have a show idea, start sending in your demos.  Pugs and Kelly.  We'll take everyone very seriously.  Start sending in your demos.  Maybe some ideas for 152.  Well, stay tuned.  Pugs and Kelly, you guys rock.  Here is Salty Apple from Whack Bag with a popular misconception.  All right.  It says, do you guys realize you're playing into his hands much like others play into yours?  Of course.  The difference being when you have a shit show and we then direct people to that show to do an assault or to listen to see how suck-ass they are, it's a shit show. 
[01:19:00]  People aren't going to sit and hang out and become listeners of a shit show.  If you have a good show and a fun show and a show people seem to enjoy and you drive traffic there, that's stupid.  Because then people will listen and go, well, these guys are kind of cool.  Wait a minute.  I didn't know about these guys and they're actually good.  Yeah.  Then they're like, oh, okay, I'll listen to this.  When they play into our hands by saying our name, we seem to have a show people enjoy, Opie. 
[01:19:30]  I've spoken to people that seem to enjoy this program and when people drive traffic over to here, they stay.  They listen, they like the show, and they stay.  Someone driving traffic over to his show, believe me, it's not going to help them.  You're not going to sit there and continue listening to that crap.  A few of our listeners might get hooked.  That's the reality of it.  But not a lot to make a difference.  Not a lot to worry us. 
[01:20:00]  How many more people are listening to Todd Schnitt or Shannon Burke because we attacked those shows?  Yeah, that didn't really work out for them.  Of course not.  Craig, your turn.  Hey, what's going on?  How's it going this afternoon?  I just want to call and say, I am the winner!  Go see ONA at Cleveland now.  I stink punching out.  What was that?  Sounded like Yiddish.  Exactly.  Thanks to our Turkish friends for listening to us on Sam. 
[01:20:30]  Thanks, I think.  Ha, ha, ha.  Well, that listener failed miserably for us.  I was going to do a Cleveland Odeon plug.  He said, go watch ONA in Cleveland, and then just fucking completely tripped.  Jim, your turn.  You're on Real Radio.  Hey, what's going on, Jim?  Talk to us.  First of all, I want to wish Will Jimmy Norton a happy birthday.  Second of all, how could you think that ONA weren't going to find out?  What now?  I want to wish little Jimmy Norton a happy birthday, and I want to know how you think  ONA weren't going to find out.  Oh, it's another one. 
[01:21:00]  Who cares?  Why do you care so much about this?  Why do I care?  Because you're sitting there, and you're saying, oh, well, you know, I'm going to check with  management and make sure that nobody's ripping me off.  But you're ripping somebody off.  I already admitted I ripped them off.  You haven't been listening to that.  Yeah, I know you didn't, Jim.  I'm giving you credit for that.  You did say at the beginning of the show that you ripped them off.  I'm giving you absolute credit for that.  So what'd you call for?  So what's the call for?  What?  Why did you think that you were going to get away with it, saying, oh, I'm going to make  sure nobody's ripping me off when you're ripping people off? 
[01:21:30]  Well, I don't understand.  And you don't rip it off one.  You rip it off two.  No, I ripped off more than that.  Newsbreakers.  Right.  That's all she had.  You know, I don't know.  God, I hope they're only paying her like $14,000 a year, because you're not getting your money's  worth.  Jesus.  What a fucking stinky hole.  Newsbreakers.  No, I ripped off more than that.  Newsbreakers.  Right.  What? 
[01:22:00]  Newsbreakers.  Right.  Right.  Right.  No, I ripped off more than that.  Newsbreakers.  Right.  Maybe she's there because she gives good head or something during the...  I have no idea.  Maybe during the really long commercial breaks they do on commercial radio, she's just like  giving all the guys head.  Maybe.  And that's why she's there.  Who knows?  And then they're like, all right, well, turn your mic on, because, man, the head's so good.  We'll let you say a couple cute words every once in a while.  I guess it's possible.  Minister of morons? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  You know, I don't understand the bit.  I mean, if this is the way that they want to get an audience, so be it.  I mean, I'll sit here for three and a half hours taking the callers to listen to Heckle  and Jekyll or Opie and Billy or whatever.  Come on, Tim.  I listen to you all the time.  Okay?  I don't...  Every day.  With all due respect, I just don't understand.  Now I'm just listening for her.  I know.  She was able to say okay.  She's all I care about.  I'm fascinated. 
[01:23:00]  She's all I care about.  That's another challenge I got.  Let's see what she has.  What kind of chops does she have?  Give her two minutes to say whatever she wants, Mr. Phillips, because I know you're  listening right now, you phony.  I have a little joke I want to say.  I got mad at somebody.  You're a minister of morons!  You're a minister of morons!  I don't know if you're trying to make a point, tell me the point. 
[01:23:30]  Did you find a point?  He's not listening.  What is the point?  All right.  All right.  I want you to take a deep breath, all right, and listen to my question.  And let's see if you are smart enough to answer or intelligent enough to at least listen to  the question.  What's the point is what I'm trying to figure out.  I understand the point.  I've already said that if they want me to say that I ripped them off, then I ripped 
[01:24:00]  them off.  I've already said that I ripped off Neil.  I've already said that I ripped off from Howard.  I've already said that I ripped off from Imus.  It's an industry full of rip-offs.  Everybody does in this.  What?  What did she say?  It's an industry full of rip-offs.  That's why we fucking hate you all, because that's the new thing in radio, where it's like  it's okay.  It's been accepted ever since radio started, that you just rip off other guys.  No, it's not okay.  I can't even get past what he's saying anymore.  I'm fixated on her total lack of anything worthwhile. 
[01:24:30]  And to answer your question, what did she say?  Nothing.  Nothing.  They said that I ripped off from Imus.  It's an industry full of rip-offs.  Just like everybody does in this.  And that makes it acceptable?  Yeah.  That makes me feel better.  I mean, I don't...  And people have ripped us off, so what is their point?  Oh!  I don't understand the point.  What's the point?  I hate radio.  There's the mentality out there.  I hate radio.  What I'm saying is that you said yesterday, I'm going to go to management to make sure  that nobody rips me off. 
[01:25:00]  Rips me off about what?  Wait.  Does it in Orlando before you do?  Does it in Orlando?  Oh my God.  Did she just get the crickets?  I love her.  Even they didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  Oh, I want to date her.  Holy crap.  Got to hear that.  After that bomb, she's going to have to deep throat the guys during the commercial breaks.  Wait.  Does it in Orlando before you do?  Wow.  It could be the longest pause ever. 
[01:25:30]  People are starting to say we're going on and on.  This is what we do.  We don't give a fuck.  We don't care.  If you like it, then keep listening.  If not, go to another channel.  Deal with it.  Enjoy the Phillips file.  Go there for some jokes.  Rips me off.  Rips me off about what?  Wait.  Does it in Orlando before you do?  Does it in Orlando before you do?  Oh, I see.  All right.  Okay.  Now, why didn't you say that then?  I think that's what he was saying.  I mean, if I do this first in Orlando and somebody wants to rip that off, let them rip it off.  I just want to do it before anybody else. 
[01:26:00]  That's the point I was trying to make.  What the man?  That's a lot.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Happy birthday, Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Who the f*** is Jimmy Norton?  Comedian.  He's a comedian.  All right.  He's now going to make believe he doesn't know who Jim Norton is.  Yeah.  He knows about Opie and Anthony, even though he said he doesn't know about us, because then  he mentioned our whole history.  Then it's pretty obvious that Jim Norton is a huge part of the show.  He's like, it's...  Do you think he knows Liddy? 
[01:26:30]  Sits in on their show.  Oh, gee.  Used to be on that Colin Quinn show.  What was that called?  Notty?  Tough Crowd.  That was it.  What is this?  Is this a show people can't get a job or can't keep a job or something?  Or what is...  I don't even understand the show.  I mean, you know, it's my experience being in this business for so many years.  You know, when you find it necessary to pick on another program or get your callers to call  another program.  I mean, you just run out of...  You've run out of everything.  Everything being done on radio has already been done before. 
[01:27:00]  There's nothing new, folks.  There's just nothing new.  Everything has been done.  If you want to call me...  That's why you're stuck in Orlando not getting syndicated.  That's a douchebag that gave up years ago.  Just gave up years ago.  And that's why your show sucks.  S.  It's popular in Orlando.  That's great.  He's another one-market sensation.  That's great.  The industry's filled with them.  You have one in your local town.  That's wonderful. 
[01:27:30]  But you're not going anywhere with that.  And to make fun of a tough crowd, what TV show were you on, Mr. Phillips?  Were you on The Tonight Show twice?  Yeah.  You're going to downplay and call Jim Norton a failure when he was just on The Tonight Show  only a month and a half ago?  You're lying more to your listeners.  Stop.  Stop lying.  Then maybe you could get syndicated to West Palm or something.  It's been done.  If you want to call me, all right, cool. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Isn't using your callers to call other shows, isn't that a Howard ripoff?  Exactly.  You know.  Not like this, my friend.  Apparently these guys have always wanted to have the popularity of Howard, and they've  never had the popularity of Howard, and now they don't even have the...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Are you fucking kidding me?  We're pretty damn close, Mr. Phillips.  We're a little closer than you now, aren't we?  He's pulling shit out of his ass now.  But the bottom line, to say that you want to be popular, yeah, that's really terrible 
[01:28:30]  in radio to be motivated to be, like, popular.  Yeah, isn't that an awful thing to actually want to be popular in radio?  It's not like you're running around the office place wanting to be popular, or you're running  around your school wanting to be popular.  This is a job based on your popularity.  The whole object of being on radio and being successful on radio is being popular.  If you're not popular, you're not successful in radio, you dickbag. 
[01:29:00]  So, of course, we want to be as popular as the number one guy out there.  Well, why wouldn't you want to be?  What else do you guys want to be as rich as Rush Limbaugh?  What an idiotic goal.  That's silly.  Shit-heads.  Stupid me for wanting to be popular.  I should have just stayed in Buffalo doing overnight radio making $14,000 a year.  God, he's so right.  This is a beaten man who wasn't good enough in his career to get any further than he's  ever gotten.  That's it. 
[01:29:30]  So he wasn't able to move on.  He's gotten bitter about it, and he's resigned to the fact that he's a one-market guy, and  that's it.  And he resents people that have ambition, drive, motivation, and have taken their careers  further because he doesn't understand how they did it.  A one-market sensation.  Yeah, that's impressive.  But you weren't creative enough, and you weren't willing to take chances to move past being  popular in Orlando.  It's a bad thing wanting to be popular.  Terrible.  Always wanted to have the popularity of Howard, and they've never had the popularity of Howard, 
[01:30:00]  and now they don't even have the popularity of this lame program.  I mean, they don't even have as many listeners as this stupid program.  At least he called it lame.  We're number one on XM, huh?  XM Satellite Radio informed us today, for me today, that this is the most listened-to,  non-music radio program being offered on XM Satellite Radio.  You know, you see, put that in your pipe and smoke it a little bit. 
[01:30:30]  Whatever.  All right, we'll put that in our pipe and smoke it, and this is what Elo said only a little  while ago on our program, and he's the head of programming at XM Satellite Radio.  All right, so let me ask you the question.  Is Jim Phillips the number one non-music show on XM Satellite Radio?  Who?  Oh, Jesus.  How?  Oh, Jim?  Oh, the Phillips file.  Dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  To Jim Phillips, your boss doesn't even know who you are.  Yeah, it's, you know, I'll have to look. 
[01:31:00]  I mean, it's not right here.  It's not right on this top page here.  Oh, God damn.  And then Elo continues.  I can assure you this, that for a non-music channel, he is not the number one rated show,  and certainly not the number one rated channel.  And not even close, right?  Not even close would be another very accurate statement as well.  Is he in the top 140?  Well, I think he does actually beat the traffic and weather channels, yes. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, okay.  Congratulations to that, Jim.  Yeah.  I mean, he does have higher ratings than that, so that sucks.  Props for that one.  All right, so there you have it, Mr. Phillips.  There you have it.  That was your boss on XM Satellite Radio, by the way.  Yeah.  A guy you probably haven't even talked to once.  Yeah, probably hasn't even had a face-to-face with Elo.  Phone call, see where we go.  Charlie, your turn.  Hey, how you doing?  Little Charlie Ranch here.  Charlie Ranch. 
[01:32:00]  How you doing?  Excellent.  How you doing?  Good, good, good.  I'm just curious.  I mean, I'd like to civilly talk to you about this whole thing with the other radio show.  I'm not going to mention their names.  Yeah, I don't care to talk to you.  How does that sound?  Oh, I thought you were going to take it on, everybody.  Hey, bring it on.  Hey, you said bring it on.  You said bring it on.  What happened to taking all comers?  Because you can't beat us.  What happened to that?  Come on, what happened?  You're smarter, quicker.  Come on, where?  Why are you dumping out?  Here's Chester again.  Hello, Chester.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  First time listener, long time caller. 
[01:32:30]  Uh-huh.  I got an observation I'm making.  Not hateful in the least.  Don't want to get dumped on.  I'm noticing that you're using the dump as a weapon.  Well, why not?  Well, no.  Just let me finish, please.  No problem.  Oh.  It doesn't work like that, Bub.  Come on, fella.  It doesn't work like that, Bub.  She didn't say Bub.  She didn't say Bub.  She said Bub.  And then she goes, come on, fella.  Can I please hear Bub?  If she says Bub.  I want to hear Bub and fella.  I'm throwing hot coffee on myself.  If this bitch said Bub, I'm dumping it on myself.  I'll hear Bub and fella. 
[01:33:00]  Well, why not?  Well, no.  Just let me finish, please.  No problem.  It doesn't work like that, Bub.  Come on, fella.  Come on, fella.  Hey.  How you doing?  Come on, fella.  It doesn't work like that, Bub.  Sweetie, if you want to be entertaining, you should be in a hick bar on a pinball machine.  That's what you should do.  Stop trying to be funny.  You're not funny.  Bub.  Bub.  Who's Fella? 
[01:33:30]  Who's his co-host?  Ethel Merman?  How old is this bitch?  Oh.  Ah, see?  Cut it out, Bub.  Ah, Bub.  She's got to be at least 50.  She is awful.  At least.  Let's get this straight.  It's my program.  I decide whatever I want to do.  Is that why you're unfair and you're unkind?  Too bad.  Yeah, let's understand that, all right?  How do you make sure?  Yeah, come on, Chester.  Come on, baby.  Come on, baby.  Huh?  Baby.  Oh, you didn't know?  Okay, I thought you dumped me.  I was just saying, I've listened to Opie and Anthony about nine months.  Well, so that's you.  There you go. 
[01:34:00]  Sorry.  And another dump the rule.  You broke the big rule.  You're a big dope.  You hurt my feelings.  Wah, wah, wah.  So I just had to do that, okay?  Certain words you can't say on the air.  I'm doing a wah, wah, wah.  I'm just going to have to go home tonight and boo, hoo, hoo.  Wow.  I'm almost embarrassed for him.  Dude, it's hard to even hate this guy.  He's so awful. 
[01:34:30]  Dude, that's embarrassingly bad.  Yeah, I wanted to ask you about your psychic abilities.  Psychic.  Yeah, it says, here from your bio, Jim exhibited psychic abilities from an extremely early age  and was deemed special by many in his family.  That's true.  Because no fuss was made over these early psychic events.  He maintained as normal a childhood as possible, aside from walking a stuffed deer to school,  whatever that.  Can you explain, like, your psychic stuff?  Well, if you read further in the biography, it also says Jim doesn't like to talk about it. 
[01:35:00]  Aha!  He didn't read that really.  Why doesn't Jim like to talk about it?  Because it's retarded?  He hasn't talked about how much of a psychic you are, you wuss.  Oh, you really hurt my feelings.  No, it's you.  I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.  I'm trying to get you to talk about your psychic abilities, but obviously you don't do that.  You're very angry and you're hurting my feelings.  That's right.  And you're a very big...  Oh, yeah.  That's what gets me.  Oh, Rachel.  No, you've come back. 
[01:35:30]  Was that her again?  Was that her again?  Yeah.  Imitating the great one.  No.  Oh, did she really do that?  No.  Oh.  Wow.  We got...  Please, can we hire her?  Oh, I know.  I want her on this show.  So she can fillet us every month.  Oh, I want that.  I want her on this show.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:36:00]  Here's one of those polls that are up.  They poll people on DJs, the channels on XM satellite.  It's pretty much the closest thing you're going to get to ratings that are available to the general public.  Like Elo said, he's got all the information.  They don't release it because they're in stiff competition with Sirius and stuff.  But he knows what's going on.  He stated that this guy is far from number one on XM.  Let's just look at Channel 152.  Here is percentages for the jocks on 152. 
[01:36:30]  Tony Kornheiser, I guess.  Ooh.  He is number one DJ on that channel with 31% of the vote for Channel 152.  G.  Gordon Liddy comes in second with 29.6% of the vote.  Phil Hendry is third with 22.5.  Monsters in the Midday are fourth with 10% of the vote.  Then comes the Philips File show with 4.7% of the vote, only followed by one other person, David Lawrence, with 1.8%. 
[01:37:00]  Not even number one on his channel.  He's just looking silly.  Yikes.  You got those ratings up there?  What's the number one show on 202?  Number one show on 202?  Oh, come on, Bob.  That's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:37:30]  With hopefully 100% considering there's no other shows.  Easy, fella.  This is the top ten shows overall.  Number one says Opie and Anthony show, 202.  All right.  And I cannot even find this douchebag.  All right.  Kenny, your turn.  You're on Real Radio.  Hey, what's going on?  That murder, those two murders that happened in Jacksonville last night.  What two murders?  Hello?  What two murders?  Um, do I sound like I'm out of breath now and having a heart attack now, you motherless 
[01:38:00]  semi-ab...  This goes on and on, obviously, because we've been at this for an hour and a half.  Yeah, Pat, you're on Real Radio.  Hey, this is Pat Battle with the Church of Opie.  Great show, guys.  Okay.  And what?  And what?  You know, huh?  Inline skate in peace, brother.  Skate in peace.  Okay.  I don't know what that means.  Is that funny to you?  No, it's funny that he wanted to, you know, he thought it was going to be. 
[01:38:30]  Whatever.  You don't want to shit yourself.  He was trying to hold it in.  I turtled.  We're almost done here.  Rudy, your turn.  Hey, good afternoon.  How's it going on this fine Florida afternoon?  Ugh, I can't stand the heat down here.  But I just want to talk about the whole thing that's going on in the Orange County schools.  I have three sons who are in school, Tony, Greg, and Jimmy. 
[01:39:00]  And I actually think it's a very good idea to extend the school day.  And I just want to touch base about that.  Extend the school day?  They're only...  You mean...  Extended by three minutes?  Yeah, it's still extending it a little bit, though.  Yeah, that's true.  They need more teaching time.  And it definitely helps out, you know, the teachers.  It helps out the parents a little bit, you know, at the tail end of the day.  Good night to play two-fers, you bitch.  1-888-978-104-111.  This is boring.  Tony, Greg, and Jimmy, huh?  Yeah.  We didn't get that one, did we? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, see, he got it, but he doesn't know anything about us.  They're clever.  But you don't know anything about us, right, Mr. Phillips?  Oh, boy.  See that show last night?  What show?  Tony, Greg, and Jimmy.  The world according to...  Three gay guys that live together?  Stop it.  Oh, the gay thing!  Oh!  Oh!  I just fell off my chair!  He didn't go down the gay route, did he?  It's a show, Tony, Greg, and Jimmy, and it's about three gay guys that live together. 
[01:40:00]  Jesus.  That's fantastic.  You're going to get it right.  It's about two DJs and a tranny lover.  That's what this program is about, mister.  It's, you know, it's ad-libbing like that.  It's the ad-libbing like that that just makes me so envious.  Mr. Phillips, give me your email, and I'll show you how gay I am, okay?  I'll show you who I'm hanging with these days, okay?  Ooh.  And Anthony will do the same, and, well, his name's Bob. 
[01:40:30]  And then Jimmy will...  I can show pictures of who I've paid to blow me.  No!  No!  Paid!  You fucking phony.  Yikes!  Hey, Chris, you're on Real Radio.  Hey, how you doing, buddy?  Okay, nothing.  Listen, I just wanted...  I'm a member of the Opie and Anthony Army, too, and I just wanted to say that your mischaracterization  of everything about these fans is completely wrong.  You make it out like...  Oh, now you get defensive.  Oh, now he's...  Now you get defensive.  Bring it on.  Tell me how you're offended now. 
[01:41:00]  This ought to be good.  Well, I'm offended because your show stinks, first of all.  But you're listening.  Thank you for your support.  Oh, you're very welcome.  And here's the thing.  Look what we've done to him.  Look what we've done to him.  Look what he's reduced to.  He's doing a show.  He started out going, bring it on, all comers.  And then he's reduced to, and this is only the first day.  Day one, asshole. 
[01:41:30]  Easy, bub.  Why?  And I'm going to go on the record, just in case you're wondering, Mr. Phillips, don't worry.  We're not going to spend another hour on this tomorrow, hour and a half on this tomorrow.  This is the opening salvo.  Now we just give it to the listeners to just beat you down on a daily basis.  Day after day after day.  I got a secret.  Enjoy it.  I got a secret.  I got a secret.  And finally, Anthony, so we can move on to other things.  Pat from Minaki is outside the studio.  I see a lot of people out there.  Also, Paul and his wife are outside the studio. 
[01:42:00]  Also, Big A is outside the studio.  Because we're going to do a show.  It'll be a short show today now.  They're going to do movie lines, right?  Yeah, they're going to do movie lines.  Great.  Here's the final call to the Phillips file.  Hello, Rose.  Hey, hey.  How are you guys?  What's going on?  Yeah, you guys are talking about Louis Black and how bad he just sucks.  I know a comedian who sucks way worse than Louis Black. 
[01:42:30]  It's Rich Voss.  He was on Last Home Extending.  He is just a terrible comedian.  Oh, yeah.  On that program?  Yeah.  It was, I think it was on the first one.  Did you finish high school?  Did I finish high school?  Yeah.  Did you get a diploma?  I actually have a master's degree.  You do?  Yes.  Master's degree in what?  A master's degree in engineering.  Eaton Grits?  Sound and sound sound. 
[01:43:00]  And master's degree from where?  See, he's attacking back because he knows very well that Rich Voss is a big part of our show.  Hey, you don't need an education to dial your fucking phone number.  And that's all that matters.  A master's degree from where?  A master's degree from...  Fungus University?  No, I...  She's trying to think of something.  Hey, it's your theme song.  Got to be quicker, honey.  Come on.  Got to speed it up.  Come on.  Get to the point. 
[01:43:30]  Get to the punchline.  Can you do it?  A lot of sound clips.  Come on.  Yeah.  I know you can do it.  Still there?  I think she went away.  When did we say Louis Black wasn't funny?  Did one of us say that?  I said it wasn't very good last night.  Oh, last night.  He's good, though.  He is funny.  Oh, she was able to say he's funny.  Did she say...  Someone's saying she said stop when the guy said three gay guys living together?  She went, stop.  Did someone...  Probably.  Can we check that in the break?  Because if she did say it, we have to hear it.  Yeah, I have to hear it.  I'm fascinated with this woman now. 
[01:44:00]  Dude, I want to isolate everything and just hear her on a loop.  Yeah.  Just play everything she said.  You getting all her sound clips?  Just her.  She's the greatest.  Oh, is she the best now?  We'll do a montage of just her.  She probably goes into work every day thanking God that no one notices that she's just a fraud  and has nothing to add to a radio show.  She probably was like the midday girl and gave out free lunch and played lunchtime blocks  and stuff and then they gave her a real gig.  A walking, breathing hot pocket.  That's it.  That's it. 
[01:44:30]  That was a lot of fun.  That was a lot of fun.  Killed an hour and 45 minutes.  Wow.  And working on a...  What's her name?  Moira?  Her name's Moira?  Her stage name is Moira.  Her stage name is Moira.  Her stage name is Moira?  What's her...  You mean she doesn't use her real name, right? 
[01:45:00]  She's not even Jewish, no.  She's not even Jewish?  She comes off as a Jewish person?  Wait, her deal is to be a Jewish broad on the radio and she picked the name Moira?  Mm-hmm.  And she's the end of the day.  Ugh.  What is she?  Italian.  Italian broad?  Yeah.  Italian broad.  Italian broad.  Italian broad.  Yeah, Jewish.  Italian broad make believe she's a Jew broad.  Oh, that's the noise.  I went, meh.  Meh.  Suck.  All right.  Yikes.  Well, we're going to take a break and get into other things.  Take a break. 
[01:45:30]  We've got to talk about Ben, actually.  Ben.  Ben didn't make it to work today.  You're kidding.  Oh.  You've got to stick around to hear why.  Stick around why.  I wouldn't have noticed if you didn't just say that.  Yeah, really.  Didn't even notice he wasn't here.  Backed out.  All right.  Lots of fun.  Lots of other things to do today, though.  And, yes, in closing, the attack will continue.  Well, the info's up on whackbag.com.  Yep.  We do our show, and we control your show for a while. 
[01:46:00]  For a while, and then we move on, because in the end, you're a nobody, too.  Oh, it'll be long enough to really annoy you.  We'll add you to the list of nobodies that we did attack and had fun with.  Knocked you around a little bit.  Yeah, somebody's posting over here.  It says, day one was funny.  Day five is going to rule.  This guy just doesn't understand.  He doesn't.  I mean, this is a hobby.  Yeah.  Everyone has hobbies.  This is our listeners' hobbies.  They enjoy it.  This is one of their hobbies. 
[01:46:30]  They have fun doing it.  And like we said earlier, if it was just, you know, about the attack on the media bit,  and he was just kind of, meh, whatever, we probably wouldn't have touched it a second  day.  We've done that before, where we go, ah, forget it, leave it alone.  But this guy's so arrogant and pompous and unfunny and such a liar that he really does have  to be shown.  Another hack that's a phony that has no honesty on his program and lies through his teeth about  just about anything.  It isn't even about the bit anymore.  Nope. 
[01:47:00]  It's just about this guy being a lying sack of shit and that unfunny hole he sits next  to.  We'll be right back. 
[01:47:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:48:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:48:30]  We'll be right back.  Oh, hey, terrific.  Oh, hey, oh, hey. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey 
[01:49:30]  That's the real deal, yeah, that's what we do. 
[01:50:00]  That's the real deal, that's the shit.  That's the real deal, yeah that's what we do.  That's the real deal, that's the shit.  That's the real deal.  You do the violence to me.  Give the virus to me  Yeah, that's what you do  But we can't get to know me  That's a shit  Give the virus to me  I had to do with you  I had to do with you 
[01:50:30]  I had to do with you  I had to do with you  I had to do with you  You're listening for the number one show in America. 
[01:51:00]  If everyone else is going to lie, we might as well lie.  The number one show in America.  You're listening to the most popular people on earth.  Oh, don't worry.  Don't do your research.  We did it already for you.  Loved by billions.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're more popular than God.  Oh, well, that didn't work for John Lennon. 
[01:51:30]  So maybe we should shut up.  Anyway, it's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  We're spreading the virus every single day.  Anyway, and I don't know.  Ben's not here today.  Can we get Ben on the phone?  He always has an excuse why we can't call him during the show when these crazy things happen to him.  And it's always crazy things.  It's always some weird thing that happens to Ben that never happens to anyone else here on the program.  You know, he had the splatters one morning and couldn't come in. 
[01:52:00]  That's why we started calling him Old Gravy Leg.  Old Gravy Leg.  And then there was another time that he overslept or something, and we were banging on his apartment, and he refused to come to the phone.  Yeah.  At least he came in after that.  Well, he never came in, and then he gets pissed off at all of us because we're pissed that our producer wasn't here for the show.  Right.  And today, everyone got phone calls very early that Ben is in the emergency room.  No.  Why is our little Ben in the ER?  If Mr. Sparks is listening, he's fine. 
[01:52:30]  I don't want to, like, freak out his family up there in Boston.  But basically what Ben is saying is that he dodged two cabs, jumped out of the way.  But how are the cabs going to, like, hit him if he's herkying and jerking the whole time?  A moving target.  It's pretty rough.  So I guess, you know what?  In all fairness to Ben, this has happened to me on occasions.  On occasions, excuse me.  Early in the morning, there's not a lot of fares out there, but there's tons of cabs. 
[01:53:00]  When they see you lift your arm up, they dart for you immediately.  And now they're in competition with the cabs right next to them or what have you.  So, okay, and I once had a cab skid to a stop onto the sidewalk in the winter to try to pick me up.  So this does happen, okay?  Matter of fact, it's gotten to the point when I do take a cab in, if I see two or three coming down the road,  I'll let all three of those pass and wait for that single cab to come eventually.  Yeah, because you don't want them all converging.  Right, because then it's a little safer, okay? 
[01:53:30]  So I guess Ben puts his hand up.  There's two cabs, and now they're darting toward him, both cabs at the same time.  Ben feels like he's going to get run over.  And jumps out of the way.  He jumped out of the way.  And hit his ankle on a bumper or something of a truck bumper.  How high did he jump?  What, was he on a pogo stick?  He jumped backwards.  So he jumped out of the way. 
[01:54:00]  This is what he's telling us.  His ankle hit a bumper of a truck.  His ankle doesn't feel right, so he decides he needs to get it checked out.  I know.  I really was born yesterday.  And he's in the emergency room with gangsters, and he just wants to get it checked out.  And that was at, what time were we here?  I guess at 6 o'clock.  I'm pretty sure.  Three hours ago.  The whole triage list, he's pretty far down there. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  They're probably treating him for Parkinson's.  You should go to Dr. Galena if you want an afternoon to kill.  Just sit in the office, go see her.  She was fantastic.  Dude, I jumped back.  I hit my nose on a mirror.  I see.  It seems like Martini Steve is the one that always gets through to Ben.  Could you call him and see what the update is on Ben and his ankle and hanging out with  gangsters in the emergency room of St. Vincent's?  Yeah, something tells me the wee hours of the morning at the ER are probably pretty colorful.  Right.  I did get him on the phone early, and he was whispering. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, yeah?  And then I'm like, well, we'd like to get you on the show, you know, because this is good  radio fodder.  And he's like, oh, they're going to make me turn off my cell phone soon.  And that was the last I heard of him.  I won't allow those in hospital, Opie.  So we don't have Ben today.  We have Wicky.  You know, I do want to move on.  Dude.  But they did isolate.  They isolated some of the holes lines from the show.  I love it.  No.  I want to hear it. 
[01:55:30]  No.  What show?  Tony, Greg, and Jimmy.  A world according to.  Three gay guys that live together.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Well, it looks like she has someone in her family that sucks cock.  That's good.  You know, that's nice, though, that she's there, the voice of reason.  The guys go off on something, and she sees maybe it's time to rein it in.  That's my role on the show.  You're very angry, and you're hurting my feelings.  That's right.  And you're a very big. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We probably have an hour of his show that we went through.  Yeah.  And this is the highlights of her.  This is all we could find that she did on the program.  Oh, boy.  I hope she feels guilty every time she has to cash that paycheck.  Stop it.  All right.  Stop it.  Stop it.  And finally, before we move on.  Oh, all right.  Just a...  Oh, boy. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I'm going to do that all day.  Dude.  I want that as my ringtone.  Fantastic.  All right.  Fantastic.  So, we're waiting for Ben to call into the program.  Won't happen.  Don't hold your breath.  What else is going on?  Oh, Angelina's kid wins adoption lottery.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Anthony brought up a great point.  New York Post, for those of you playing at home, and I'm sure this picture is turning  up all over the country. 
[01:57:00]  Angelina Jolie.  Angelina Jolie.  You all know she went to Africa to get another little child.  What does she have?  A little Korean kid now?  Yeah, Max.  She got a little Korean kid, and she went and picked up an African kid.  That kid won the lottery.  This kid, it had to be kept in the hospital for a week to get over dehydration when it  came to the United States, when she brought it back. 
[01:57:30]  But now, it went from a life of flies buzzing around its head and certain death to being a  child of one of the rich Hollywood elite.  How do you do that?  Is it like a puppy pen at the pound?  Do you pick it out?  Do you look at the other ones and go, sorry?  Do you walk through the mud field and pick out the one you want?  Play a little tune on their ribs, and the one that sounds the best, you take it home? 
[01:58:00]  What do I feed it?  Well, you have to water it.  She forgot to water it.  Had dehydration.  But, wow, that is an African kid.  Big round head, huge eyes.  And you've got to give her a lot of credit, obviously.  Why is that?  Because she's doing the right thing.  Oh, she's got a Cambodian kid.  Huh?  A Cambodian kid named Maddox.  He won't eat much. 
[01:58:30]  But, oh, you think this is a good thing?  Yeah, of course.  Them going over there?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  I mean, that's what she chooses to do, you know?  Do you think it's more for publicity, or do you think it's she really genuinely cares?  There's the point where you go, well, how much attention do you need?  But then again, it's almost like, for whatever reason, like, everybody talks about doing stuff.  But if you want to go out and adopt somebody, instead of just talking shit, you've got to give...  Yeah, she doesn't need the...  I'm definitely going to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Dude, she's on the cover of almost every magazine with this whole Brad Pitt thing. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  She doesn't...  She's not doing it for the publicity.  I mean, a lot of these Hollywood people definitely do stuff for publicity.  And I think she's just doing the right thing.  And it's going to bring a lot of attention to this.  And it'll probably lead to other people looking toward, I don't know, Ethiopia for adoption.  A lot of these Hollywood types do that.  International adoptions.  They go over and get...  So that's why I think it might be a trendy thing in their little Hollywood community.  Right, right.  Like, who can get the most fucked up kid and bring it home, you know? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, well...  Go grab this skinny little Ethiopian with bug eyes.  You've got to fast forward 10 years, because you're 100% right.  I think her heart's in the right place.  But the problem here, there's going to be other celebrities that do exactly the same thing.  Fast forward 10 years and see where those kids are.  And, oh, well, he was a little too troubled, so we...  Gave him back.  Gave him back or this and that.  Yeah, because in Hollywood, they're doing that with the doggies.  Yeah.  You know, it became trendy.  I don't even know who started.  Maybe Paris Hilton to walk around with a little rat dog. 
[02:00:00]  A little dog, and you have it with you all the time.  And now all of them are doing the little rat dog thing.  And, you know, damn well, they're not keeping the dog as soon as this trend goes away.  You know?  All those little doggies are going to be somewhere else.  That's what you've got to look out for.  Because as soon as one person hits with the new trend in Hollywood, they all follow suit.  Who else has kids?  Spielberg?  Like, adopted a bunch of...  Woody Allen?  Woody Allen?  Woody Allen adopts him, then marries him?  That rocks.  Woody does what you should do with adopted kids. 
[02:00:30]  Take naked pictures of them.  Tom Cruise?  The Cruise Meister, sure.  And it just seems like it's a trendy thing to do.  Like, they all compete with their cars, and, you know, it's all a gag of they pull up in an odd car, and then everybody wants that kind of car.  I think that might be what's going on.  They have their little chit-chats.  One of them has this fucked up kid from some weird faraway land.  And then the other one has to top it.  But, you know, she went right to Ethiopia and grabbed this little kid. 
[02:01:00]  And the picture of the kid is priceless.  The eyes are so big, like, oh my God, my life has been saved.  I wonder if they judge it by, like, the thing for them is, like, what was the most fucked up way that parents were killed?  Yeah, because you've got to wonder, you know, obviously the kid doesn't have parents.  Is it an orphanage, you think?  Or maybe the kids' parents sold the kid?  Well, she's big on this type of stuff, though.  She's, like, over there a lot doing that type of humanitarian work.  Yeah.  What a gal.  I wouldn't do it. 
[02:01:30]  I'd waste my time getting a horse.  I mean, she wants to do something really healthy for the world.  You've got to give her credit.  People were criticizing Rosie O'Donnell, remember that?  Because she was going for just basic white kids.  Right.  She went with white children.  Who criticized her?  There were people actually criticizing, saying that, oh, she's going, she's making an extra effort to get little white children.  Yeah.  And it's hard to do.  They're hard to get.  It's a lot easier to get a kid from another country, perhaps.  And they criticized her for that.  But, you know, I think I'd be one of those people. 
[02:02:00]  I want them all the same set.  Even in my neighborhood, I want that.  Yeah.  What do you think goes on in this kid's head?  And you fast forward 12 or 13 years, and he starts learning about where he came from.  You've got to think the kid's going to have a lot of guilt.  Yeah?  A lot of guilt.  He'll just be a grateful little guy.  Well, he's going to be very grateful, but then it's got to play on you a little bit, like where he came from and stuff.  And, I mean, I'm sure he has a ton of brothers and sisters and relatives and all that.  What a thing to hold over the kid's head, though, when he starts mouthing off to you. 
[02:02:30]  I took you out of the jungle.  You were starving on a little anthill.  Yeah.  Guilt.  That's huge in the news today.  Angelina Jolie.  He wins.  The other kids, well, bleached bones on the dried mud floor.  On the Serengeti?  On the Serengeti.  Hey, we've got a lot of freaks outside the studio today.  I noticed that when I went to go take a leak and was just about accosted by Sandy Kane. 
[02:03:00]  An awful camera.  Eh, eh.  With her portable little Kodak cardboard camera.  What year is this?  She brings it in every time she comes on the show and just takes pictures of everybody.  Yeah.  It's so annoying.  First, Patty is sitting there.  She has hundreds of pictures of us already, but every time she has to get new pictures of us.  Patty's sitting there, so I open up the door to go out into the hallway to go to the bathroom,  and Patty goes, someone's out there.  Right when I open the door, Sandy Kane spins around and snaps a picture. 
[02:03:30]  And he goes, eh, give me a hug.  Eh.  I'm like, I don't touch people.  I ran for the bathroom.  I hugged her.  And then Poe shows up.  Sandy, get in here.  I hugged her.  You did?  We're closing, yeah.  All right, well, what are we going to do?  No touching.  You've got stalker Patty.  You've got Paul and his wife.  You've got the big A, Pat from Menaki, and Sandy Kane.  Is that it?  Are you going to look at her camera and maybe take a good look at it?  Why?  Just take a good look at the camera and just examine it. 
[02:04:00]  Be careful you don't drop it.  Nothing going to shock her, though.  Hey, can you bring Sandy Kane in here?  Eh, eh.  Awful sandwich.  You've probably got a picture of a UFO on it on the way over.  Bigfoot.  Eh, eh.  It's going to make her rich.  Why are those guys cringing in the other studio?  Oh, because they know you.  So, what's going to happen?  I know, he's the worst eater.  Yeah, but it smells so good.  Sandy Kane in studio. 
[02:04:30]  And she's mocking everyone else because we invited her in first.  You're looking like a real tramp today.  Hey, I don't blame you because you guys bring out the breast to me.  Oh, see?  Good.  Usually they say best.  She's got a...  I got my CD, man.  I want to do a song.  All right, we'll let you do a song.  She's got her Starbucks with...  Look at all the lipstick all over her Starbucks cup.  Right.  Hey, you want a picture of me?  I was rude before.  I would love a...  All right, here.  Because I got my new website.  What's the website? 
[02:05:00]  I'm going to put you guys...  It's called Sandy Kane.  SandyKane.com.  All right.  All right, gorgeous.  Why do you just snap pictures of everybody?  Because I...  All right, wait, wait.  You know, because...  Was I rude?  Was I rude when we were leaving for the bathroom?  I was really rude.  I got to admit, Anthony, I was rude to Sandy Kane.  She was trying to get a picture.  She's a big fan of the show.  I am.  Don't be rude.  And I put my hand up.  I didn't want to give you a good shot, right?  And that's not nice of me.  What do you do with dry sand?  I know.  You do a lot for the show. 
[02:05:30]  No, I'm just saying.  You want me behind...  You want this in the background?  I love you.  You want this...  I masturbate to you at night.  Oh.  Do you want this in the background?  Close to you, man.  Shut up.  Do you want this in the background of your picture?  Yes.  All right.  Because I got one in the background.  All right.  No problem.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Take a really good picture.  You want the mic?  Take your dick out.  You want the mic like this?  Is this a good shot?  Very cute.  Nice, right?  Jimmy, why don't you take a picture with Sandy Kane?  We've got to be nice.  Here, take another one. 
[02:06:00]  There you go.  I think you've got two good ones.  Jimmy, take a picture with Sandy Kane.  No, I don't want you to talk to me.  You've got to stand next to me.  Here, let me take the picture of you and Jimmy.  I think that would be really nice.  No, no.  Hold on.  All right, hold on.  How do you do the flash?  It's on.  All right.  Jimmy, why don't you smile for Sandy Kane?  I'm going to get a good one for her website here.  Doesn't she look like a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader?  Wait, hold on.  From the Bart's star days? 
[02:06:30]  Hold on.  Are you going to get the finger?  That's a nice picture.  That'll be nice on the website.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  Nah.  Do you want...  Well, you can get a picture of Anthony.  No.  No, she'll just stand over there.  Nathaniel stands there, and I'll stand here.  I don't take pictures.  I'll go take a picture of Anthony.  Let's go.  Don't get...  Right there.  And then I'll be here.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're not getting the pictures, Sandy.  You're going to move over a little bit.  Stop it.  No.  Why am I being left unattended?  Just a little closer.  Don't touch Anthony, though.  He's a freak one. 
[02:07:00]  Yes, Sandy.  All right.  This will be a good picture.  Guys, why don't you smile?  Anthony, look this way.  Anthony, just look this way.  Look, they're holding Sandy.  He came back.  It's not that fucking picture.  God damn it.  Sandy, you can't be able to have a picture.  Shut up.  Wait.  One, two.  All right.  There you go.  Anyone else want a picture?  Look at this one with Jim.  No.  All right.  Here, Sandy.  Here, take your camera back.  Don't take one with Hawk.  Give me your head.  Give me your head.  Sandy, take your camera back.  I hate her.  I'm giving head. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  All right.  It's my oral sex.  Shut up.  Here, come get your camera.  Thank you so much.  No, come and get it.  You know, he's a gorgeous man on the inside, too.  And a nice person, right?  Because I just took all the pictures for you.  You have, you know, you're polite.  Oh, God.  What?  What happened?  If I commit suicide...  What happened? 
[02:08:00]  You will know.  And the blood will be on your hands.  So will everyone else by the applause coming out of the studio.  No, I mean, I was going to commit suicide, but my mother would kill me.  What happened?  But now, I...  Oh, I'm sorry.  See, it's still intact.  It is?  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Throw it back to Opie.  Opie, give that back.  The film's not damaged, dude.  No.  You can't break...  Those things are indestructible.  Oh, come on!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:08:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Goodbye.  I'll tell you later.  Goodbye.  That's all right.  Hey, you know, I mean, I've got to roll with the punches.  Oh!  Okay.  There's the film.  There's probably some nice photos on there.  Sandy, what was on there?  What pictures were on there?  You.  That's it?  Yeah.  You didn't have anything on the way in?  Well, I'm...  George Bush? 
[02:09:00]  No.  UFO?  My Bush?  Bigfoot?  You know, hey...  Loch Ness Monster?  I just love being with you guys, and I'll take a picture in my mind.  And I could say, fuck you.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  All right.  I want to do one of my songs.  I don't love my CV.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  We'll get to that.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  All right.  Which one do you want?  I just want to ask you guys.  Can I do Let Me Suck Your Cock?  Yeah, in a little while.  Okay.  All right, Opie, do you got your rocks off?  You got your cock off, man?  I heard that on PLJ the other day.  I mean, what...  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  What abuse?  I mean, I don't need a gynecologist.  Thank you, Sandy. 
[02:09:30]  Well, at least you're not looking at my hemorrhoid today.  No.  You're doing something else, man.  Something else.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Keep it up.  Leave the CD in here.  Yeah, bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Lipstick on your coffee cup?  Why not?  Can I see the CD?  Yeah.  I have a new one called Lipstick on Your Penis.  Can I see the CD?  It looks like your pussy was drinking out of that coffee cup.  Those lips don't wear lipstick.  What is that one called?  Tits My Party?  Tits My Party.  That's a great one.  Sandy, you do realize you just gave that to Opie. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but he wants to play a track.  Opie, what track do you want to play?  Sandy, did you see what he did to your camera?  I did.  I mean, what can I do, man?  I don't know.  What can I do?  I like when she sings her songs on the show.  That is true.  All right.  Ah!  Oh, God.  I can't.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Do I see a picture of us on the back of the CD?  Okay, so is that what it is?  Well, now I didn't take a picture, so. 
[02:10:30]  What?  You're a motherfucker.  No, I.  That takes my whole life, you man, you know?  Oh, B.  Let me see your cowboy hat.  Is that the CD?  Whose is that?  Why don't you do that to that one?  Which one?  That's Elo.  No, we like Elo.  That CD's Elo saying, help.  You don't like mine?  Did you hear it?  You don't like I Love Dick?  That was a number one dance hit in Miami Beach.  Was it?  That was a number one.  Well, the gays, like, bought it.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Jesus.  I Love Dick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on his dick. 
[02:11:00]  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Do you have another CD with you?  No.  Oh, you just brought the one?  Yeah.  Oh, that's too bad.  Oh, Sandy, I thought you brought two, one for Opie to smash, and then another one to  sing to.  Oh, well.  I can always come back.  All right.  What's that hat?  When can I come back?  Can I see your hat?  And I do want to do a song, because Ben said to me, you can do a song.  You're in a little cowboy outfit.  Well, on the Dolly Parton.  Oh, there's a copy of this CD.  Of comedy.  All right.  Why don't we get Sandy Kane out of the studio for now?  How about I leave it in your hat?  All right, Sandy.  Put the hat on the monitor.  Thank you, Sandy.  Sandy.  You want a hat?  No, leave it on the top.  You would look good in his hat. 
[02:11:30]  Can we please get Sandy?  Is anyone controlling the show?  Sandy, leave it on there.  Sandy, we'll have you back in later.  Sandy, leave the hat on top of me.  Opie, you have my CD?  No.  Come on, Sandy.  Come on, Sandy.  Thank you.  We'll have you back in a little while.  Sandy, leave the hat on top of my CD.  She's already collecting dollar bills in her...  It looks cool.  Leave it there.  Yeah, well, don't take it, man.  I'm not going to take it.  You guys might take it or smash it.  No.  Give me that hat!  She's running at the studio.  Get the fucking hat. 
[02:12:00]  You are brutal.  You are brutal.  I can't do it.  Please cut the hat with scissors.  Oh, cut it into little squares.  I want my fucking hat, man.  Oh, no.  Get it.  Get it up, man, please.  Oh, how does she get it back?  I want my fucking hat, man.  I want my hat, man.  Bob Kelly came.  Get my hat, man.  Get my hat, man.  Come on, man.  She's such a hippie. 
[02:12:30]  Over here, the scissors in his hands, and she grabbed it away.  You could have cut it into little postage-sized pieces.  I just wanted it cut in half.  Yeah, just in half.  Which step on it?  A perfect half a hat.  Just perfectly cut in two.  Oh, boy.  No, hat.  Stop.  Stop.  No.  Now, when you were going to smash that, if there was a woman in here, she would have said,  Oh, stop. 
[02:13:00]  Now, give her that back.  I'm stepping in.  Don't be funny.  Big moon face.  All right, Anthony, we got the top story of the day.  We got the audio of the top story of the day here.  I want to play for everybody, okay?  Chris from Boston actually has the whole image perfect.  He goes,  Does Sandy Kane look like JonBenet Ramsey at 70 and strung out on heroin?  Yes.  He's wearing a little JonBenet Ramsey outfit. 
[02:13:30]  Yes.  Oh, man.  That thing really exploded.  Didn't you see a CD come apart like that?  There's not even a recognizable piece of the camera left.  No, you really smashed the camera.  She probably could have taken it in after the first bash, but the second one and then  the third one, that did it.  And then, yeah.  All right.  So, we got audio of the top story of the day.  Let's go to that now, and then we'll discuss, because it's a big deal, actually.  We'll do something serious here.  Pan-bannel.  Pan-bannel.  Pan-bannel. 
[02:14:00]  Pan-bannel.  Pan-bannel.  Danny, what's the matter, hon?  Pan-bannel.  You having a bad dream?  Pan-bannel.  Danny's not here, Mrs. Dorrance.  I fucking hate you all.  First thing, honestly, I got my new TV hooked up last night, finally. 
[02:14:30]  First thing I watched, because I'm not supposed to.  It's the first thing I watched on my new television.  I'm not supposed to.  Yeah, you watched the show on there.  Just that part.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  With a nice big screen TV.  Yeah.  Was there a wow sign on CNN or an Opie and Anthony sign or someone just trying to mess  with us with us today?  There we go.  Who knows.  Who knows.  All right.  We'll find out.  All right.  Here's the audio of the top news story of the day.  Lord Vader.  Pat.  Battle station plans are not aboard this ship, and no transmissions were made. 
[02:15:00]  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.  She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Set a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally.  Pat.  Battle.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.  Yes, sir.  That's an awful Vader impression.  Yeah.  Pat.  Battle.  Enough of the Pat Battle.  Pat Battle's taking on a life of its own.  Yeah.  I would say so. 
[02:15:30]  Even the head of programming at the XM Satellite Radio had a Pat Battle reference there.  She rules.  All right.  Here's the tease of the story of the day.  A video game with hidden porn.  Parents say it is not for kids, and now the video game industry has something to say.  Oh.  They teased the shit out of this story last night.  And you can thank Hillary Clinton, because she's watching out for all of us.  She's protecting us.  And here's the way the whole thing's been presented.  The dangers of video games. 
[02:16:00]  Go ahead, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Here's the way the whole thing's been presented.  GTA San Andreas comes out.  Little children have it.  There's some sexual content on it that can be unlocked through a quick internet download.  They find this out and now give this game that little children were playing and had access to,  now they give it an adults-only rating.  And it is now not available at Walmart, Best Buy, all these wholesome places. 
[02:16:30]  No longer carry the game because it doesn't have an M rating anymore.  It's got an adult rating.  The fact of the matter is, this thing had an M rating.  M rating is 17 and older.  17 and older.  The way it's presented, though, was that little children had access to this game.  They now increased it to 18.  So it went from 17 to 18.  That's all that happened here.  And what really happened... 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, but that one year is a huge difference.  ...is it's not going to be available and sold in a lot of stores.  A lot of stores that sell a lot of games.  You know, we kind of look at Walmart like, what?  You know, we live here in New York.  You could go to one of the Game Stops or there's plenty of different places to buy video games.  A lot of towns around the country only have the big dealers.  Walmart, Best Buy, those places to buy their games.  Now they're not going to carry it.  Is it censorship?  Well, no, because the government didn't say that it's got to be eliminated completely. 
[02:17:30]  But in doing things like this, they remove it from the consumer and you can't find it.  You can't buy it.  And it becomes a form, a sideways kind of backdoor form of censorship.  Now this game, a lot of places try to find it.  Good luck.  Because of the pressure that Hillary Clinton...  That Hillary put on for one year.  Started.  For people that were 17, now you've got to be 18 to buy it.  What difference does that make? 
[02:18:00]  Why did they buckle and change it?  Why?  Because of children.  Because she was presenting it like 8-year-olds are buying and playing this game.  That's absolutely...  They talk about the children.  You're talking about 17-year-olds.  They're 17.  That's not a child.  When it comes to video games, you buy them, you play them.  You're old enough to play these games responsibly and not worry about them seeing inappropriate content.  She's presenting it like it was small children playing this game and seeing this content. 
[02:18:30]  And the fact of the matter is it was rated M, 17 years old.  Now it's 18.  No one's talking about how it's a one-year goddamn difference that makes no difference.  It's censorship.  This is the only way that people in our government can censor things without saying they're censoring it.  They did the same thing with radio and television.  They make it so expensive for the people that are doing the creative content and presenting it, the TV stations, the radio stations, 
[02:19:00]  that it no longer becomes profitable to do edgy material.  Did the government say you couldn't do it?  No, not completely.  We got our words we don't want you to use.  But you can get on and talk about sexual matters.  Oh, you do it, we're going to find the fuck out of you.  But you could do it because to not allow you to do it would be censorship.  They're censoring us, people.  They really are.  And this game is one example. 
[02:19:30]  Watch how this snowballs.  Every game now you see that's coming out, this is going to scare the shit out of game makers.  Rockstar just had to revamp their earnings now.  They came out and said we're projecting that our earnings are going to be lower than they were.  So their stock goes down.  Now other game companies see this and go, I don't want to get an adult rating, so what am I going to do?  I'm going to milk toast down my fucking games.  I'm going to calm them down.  Not as much killing.  Not as much sex in it.  And you know what that means?  It's not as entertaining.  Sorry. 
[02:20:00]  That's just the way it is.  The adults can't have it.  Right.  The adults can't have it.  Oh, they can have it?  No, they just put it on the adult only thing.  Oh, so it can't be available in any of these stores?  I'm not going to do that.  What I'll do?  I'll calm the fucking game down.  So all these guys are going to run scared.  You have seen the end of games like Grand Theft Auto.  Bitch.  Because they will definitely calm these down and keep them in the stores.  You can't blame them.  They've got to make a living.  And it's us, the adults, that suffer.  We suffer because the people that enjoy these games.  It's all about the children. 
[02:20:30]  All about the children.  And we sacrifice our own entertainment for that.  Couldn't even keep your husband happy.  Yeah.  Couldn't satisfy your husband.  He had to stick cigars in intern's pussies.  That's what a good job you did, you fat-ankled whore.  Now you're worried about family values and what's good for children.  And under your own roof, the man who you share a ring with was fucking somebody with a Cuban. 
[02:21:00]  And that had nothing to do with violent video games.  Nothing to do with it.  Yeah, what are you blaming that on?  I'm sure she's got something to blame it on.  Because it wasn't her.  Couldn't have been her.  All his fault.  Ewan Schumer.  Cousin Brucie and video games.  How about radical Islam?  How about dealing with that in the city and stop fucking dealing with video games and Cousin Brucie?  How about leaving the distractions to everyday life, to the bullshit we've got to deal with in everyday life that you don't take care of? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, like Islam.  Like terrorism.  How about you deal with those and leave the fun little distractions that maybe take our minds off of this bullshit for a couple of seconds a day.  How about you leave those alone?  Movies, radio, TV.  The fun little things that we enjoy.  That take our minds off the shit you're not fucking working on.  Unbelievable.  Here's how the story was presented on the news. 
[02:22:00]  Well, a video game with a dirty secret has been slapped with an adults-only rating.  Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a bestseller.  But the maker of the game has been under intense pressure.  Since it was revealed, there's explicit sexual content on it that can be seen with an internet download.  Rockstar's games claim the sex content was mistakenly left on the disc.  Senator Hillary Clinton says that she's upset porn got into the hands of kids.  And she added, so many parents already feel like they are fighting a battle against violence and sexually explicit material with their hands tied behind their backs. 
[02:22:30]  This is what amounts in the movies to an X rating.  It's an X rating.  This is adults-only.  What this does, the game company, you know how expensive it is to go through the whole process of making a quality video game?  It costs a lot of money.  A lot of money to make those games.  They have to recoup the money.  The only way to do that is to make it available to the widest audience they can.  To get it into the stores like Walmart and Best Buy and Target. 
[02:23:00]  With an adult rating, these stores won't carry it.  They won't recoup the money it costs to make the game.  So, what do you do?  You don't make games with the kind of content that's going to get an adult rating.  We're fucked.  Now the games that we all enjoy.  Like he said, it's a bestseller.  Why do you think that game is a bestseller?  Why do you think it's outsold other video games?  Because people enjoy that content.  They enjoy playing those games.  It's not a bestseller because it's been whitewashed. 
[02:23:30]  Why do these politicians think they are smarter than the majority?  They are smarter than everyone out there that is buying these games.  They'll ignore the fact that it's like the hottest game out there.  Like, oh, all those people are nuts though.  I've got to ask why.  I've got to show you what's really right here.  You have no idea, obviously.  Why is it the hottest game out there?  They do that with popular radio shows and everything else in this country.  Because 20 perverts, all with billions of dollars, are buying up all the games. 
[02:24:00]  That must be it.  It's not the fact that everyone across the country is enjoying this.  All video gamers are enjoying this game.  And they still can't prove that video games have an influence on children's minds.  Nope.  They've tried.  Not at all.  They've tried to come up with studies and all.  They just don't have it.  Yeah.  They don't have it.  For one year difference.  For 17 to 18.  17 years old to 18 year old.  Because they don't want it in the hands of the children. 
[02:24:30]  And by children, she meant 17 year old people.  And the gaming company was showing responsibility by making it 17 and older to begin with.  Yep.  So what they're going to do is pull the sexual content out of the game.  And a lot of the violence.  And try to get it down to an M rating.  But in the meantime, this is going to get an adults only rating.  They've pulled all those games off the shelves already.  And they're going to try to give it an adults rating.  Why won't Walmart sell it if it's adults only?  Why not?  Why?  What's the problem? 
[02:25:00]  Well, it's a family company.  Really?  Yeah, it's a family company.  That's interesting.  They won't be able to advertise adults only titles like NC-17, X-rated movies, things like that.  You don't see advertising for that.  But, you know, is someone going to step in and go,  Why are they advertising these things on television?  They're going to try to get rid of that.  Just watch how this shit snowballed.  And you know who loses?  The people that just wanted to sit down and play a fucking video game.  Not shoot up their school.  Not rape. 
[02:25:30]  Not pillage.  You want to throw the disc in and have a little fun after your bullshit fucking day.  Thanks.  You waste of fucking, waste of humanity.  Hillary Clinton.  And fuck the stores, too, for Buckley.  If Walmart wants to sell something, how about flight instructions?  That would be an appropriate sale.  Shitheads.  Well, that's an argument you'll never win with Walmart.  They are the most hypocritical, worst.  Awful.  I am one of the biggest gun advocates ever.  I love guns, love shooting them, love owning them, love seeing them be shot. 
[02:26:00]  But the fact that Walmart, you know, just sells guns, yet they pull fake, you know, video game guns off the shelves, that's ridiculous.  It's sickening.  Sell it all.  Sell it all.  All right.  Why don't we break in the...  Thanks, Hillary.  See what the rest of these freaks are about today.  She's irrelevant.  She contributes nothing original.  Nothing.  She's not what?  One original idea to the table.  No.  Political hack.  It's all this bullshit that her constituents see, these soccer mom ass wipes, and they cheer for it. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, she's protecting our children.  No, she's not.  How did she protect Chelsea from finding out the awful truth that her father diddled an intern with a cigar and then blew a load on her dress when she was only a couple of years older than she was?  How is that protecting your daughter?  Ugh.  Too busy with her political ambitions to even notice what her husband was doing.  Exactly.  Good job. 
[02:27:00]  Good job.  You can't keep your eye on one guy, your own man.  You're going to keep an eye on the entire state of New York.  Chuck Schumer's nose buried up her ass.  Her cheerleader, Chuck Schumer, also.  Yeah, the games.  Yeah.  We got to get rid of these games.  Yeah, get rid of the games.  Thanks, Chuck.  God, this annoys me.  All right.  I'm through.  They took a little more away from us today.  Bastards.  Yep, that's what they do.  Just a little at a time. 
[02:27:30]  Chip, chip, chip.  A lot of people will be like, well, what's the big deal, really?  Yeah.  Start adding it up.  Apparently, there was some problem in England today.  Yeah, I wonder what group was involved.  Yeah, I wonder what group's involved.  You know, we got to worry here in New York and in the United States.  We got to worry about that.  But thank God that awful game isn't in Walmart today.  Thank you, Hillary.  What a waste.  Bags are being searched in D.C. on trains  because they're worried about a certain group bringing on bombs. 
[02:28:00]  How about dealing with that fucking group  and stop pretending that it's not them?  Mm-hmm.  How about that?  You stop pretending that it could be anybody  when we all know who it is.  The energy it takes to get a video game taken off the shelves,  I think it could best be spent elsewhere,  if I could speak.  You're right.  Spelt spent.  It could be spelt elsewhere.  All right.  We're going to step aside and... 
[02:28:30]  Bah!  Bah!  Oh, yeah, well...  Team America, yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  I guess.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  Coming again to save the motherfucking day, yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  Freedom is the only way, yeah.  Terrorist your game in blue  because now you have to answer to America. 
[02:29:00]  Fuck yeah.  So lick my blood and suck on my own, America.  Fuck yeah.  What you gonna do when we come for you now?  It's a dream that we all share  to the whole world tomorrow.  Fuck yeah.  We got us.  Fuck yeah.  Walmart.  Fuck yeah.  To gas.  Fuck yeah.  Beespawn.  Fuck yeah. 
[02:29:30]  NFL.  Fuck yeah.  Rock and roll.  Fuck yeah.  Internet.  Fuck yeah.  Flavories.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Star Wars.  Fuck yeah.  Disney World.  Fuck yeah.  Porno.  Fuck yeah.  Valleo.  Fuck yeah.  Reeboks.  Fuck yeah.  Fake tits.  Fuck yeah.  Sushi.  Fuck yeah.  Taco Bell.  Fuck yeah.  Rodeo. 
[02:30:00]  Fuck yeah.  Back bath and beyond.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Liberties.  Fuck yeah.  White slip.  Fuck yeah.  The Alamo.  Fuck yeah.  Band-Aid.  Fuck yeah.  Los Vegas.  Fuck yeah.  Christmas.  Fuck yeah.  Immigrant.  Fuck yeah.  Part-time.  Fuck yeah.  Democrats.  Fuck yeah.  Republicans.  Fucking shit.  Books.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and you. 
[02:30:30]  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv and I'm weird but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay. 
[02:31:00]  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the face. 
[02:31:30]  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  Let the body to the throat.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Like galloping horses. 
[02:32:00]  This stupid radio show spreading across America as we slowly but surely rebuild our radio careers.  Not so slowly.  Not so slowly, according to Elo.  We're going to get some important info right after the program.  I am so excited to hear about this.  We're going to have a conference call with Elo right after the show.  Elo.  So all you commercial radio douchebags, keep, first of all, keep listening.  And second of all, keep making fun of us.  Nah.  I hope you, Anthony, always, always win in the end. 
[02:32:30]  Always.  I don't like being picked on.  Yeah, picked on.  What a douche.  Who did the prep sheet today, man?  There's actually a lot of stuff on it.  Well, look who's in town.  Who did that?  I don't know.  There's just a lot of stuff.  A lot of meat to it.  Look who's in town.  It's beefy.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I don't even know where to go.  There's so much stuff.  Yeah, I don't know what we do with this, but, yeah, Scotty died, 85, from Alzheimer's. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  From Star Trek, obviously.  Beam me up, Scotty.  Something he never said or something, right?  Yeah, never actually said, beam me up, Scotty.  It's always, you know, Scotty, beam me up, beam me up, energize, Scotty, energize, things like that.  Right.  It's one of those famous lines that were never said.  Yeah, Big Kev called this one a few months back.  He actually predicts which Star Trek characters will be dropping dead.  He had bones.  DeForest Kelly told me a couple of weeks in advance. 
[02:33:30]  He said, DeForest Kelly, not looking too good.  I think the end is near.  Well, because he sees these guys at the convention.  Yeah, he sees them.  He assesses their health, I guess.  And Scotty was another one.  He goes, he doesn't look good, man.  It's not going to be long.  And, boom, there he goes.  He did say that very recently.  And he died of Alzheimer's, huh?  Alzheimer's and pneumonia.  Kev is one of those homoerotic male nurses.  He's probably smothering these people.  Going into their hospital rooms and suffocating them. 
[02:34:00]  And, you know, I don't know.  I want to bring up a point here.  You know, he wants his ashes to be shot into space.  Into space.  Like the creator of Star Trek.  Gene Roddenberry.  I guess that actually happened, right?  Yeah, Gene Roddenberry had a small portion, like a lipstick tube-sized container of his ashes,  brought up in one of the space shuttles when they were launching a satellite,  and tossed out there.  Into orbit.  And then slowly it will, its orbit decays and it comes through the atmosphere and kind  of makes a little shooting star. 
[02:34:30]  That's visible from the ground.  You could actually see it streaking through the sky, and he kind of wanted that.  His won't be visible.  Hmm?  How will his be visible?  If, when it comes through the atmosphere.  How big is it?  It burns up.  Just the size of a lipstick.  A lot of shooting stars you see, by the way, Jimmy, they're only the size of a grain of  sand or perhaps even a small pebble, and they're so visible because it's such a huge  amount of heat and friction.  How do you know that?  Um, Discovery Channel.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[02:35:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  You know what happens in the studio?  Yeah.  Because I just saw it happen again.  Yeah, what?  Jimmy and I feeling very confident about our abilities, and we're standing during the show,  and we're like, yeah, we have important things to say in this program.  Then you just blow us away.  You know what just happened?  Jimmy pretty much sighed, and then he took a seat.  You just took him right out of the game.  It's not about that.  It's just about...  Your intelligence takes us out of the game.  Well, because he said, you know, it's like, no, matter of fact, I didn't know. 
[02:35:30]  But you sat down like a defeated man, like, oh, God, not again.  So something the size of lipstick container would absolutely be visible.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  I actually thought that they would...  I knew those things happened.  I always thought they were, like, much bigger rocks, like the size of this table or something  that just got burned up.  No.  No.  Something the size of this table, depending on its material, could make it to the ground.  Okay.  That's what I was thinking. 
[02:36:00]  Have you looked up...  Absolutely make it to the ground.  A dumb little thing, because I was way out east at my brother's house, and we had, like,  an illegal bonfire and stuff, and drinking wine around a fire.  Have you looked up at the sky recently?  When you can?  Like, in New York City, you can't really see.  You can't really there.  Yeah, it might have too much lights and stuff, but if you're out in the country, have you  noticed how many satellites you could see?  Satellites?  Satellites just zooming by?  Can you see them?  I never saw them.  Are you kidding?  Like, I am dead serious.  It is unbelievable.  I don't know how many you could see. 
[02:36:30]  A lot.  Anthony, I'm talking.  We were counting them.  During the day or at night?  At night.  When you see all the stars out, then you'll see the satellites actually moving across the  sky.  How do you see them?  Are they lit up?  Are there little dots?  There's lights on them or whatever.  Yeah.  Are you in an airplane?  Someone will back me up on this.  This is not one of these dopey-opey things.  Dopey-opey things.  I would think certain times of the day.  But I mean, I'm telling you, it's unbelievable.  Probably see it.  Because there was a time you'd see one maybe every once in a while, like you'd see a shooting  star every once in a while.  But now, if you just focus on the sky at night when all the stars are out, it's unbelievable 
[02:37:00]  how much movement is up there now with the satellites.  Hmm.  Criss-crossing all over the place.  I'll have to check that one.  Check that out.  I'll check that out.  And give me a full report, Anthony.  I know at certain times of the day you could see them because there aren't really lights  on them.  It's a reflection from the sun.  Yeah.  Whatever it is.  But I mean, there's something that you could see the object moving across the sky.  So, it's very, very interesting.  Yeah.  Why would anyone think there's lights on them?  It's a good thing.  Well, you really don't need lights up there. 
[02:37:30]  Why would you need to have headlights?  Because they're pretty.  Because they're pretty and they're futuristic looking if they have blinking lights.  I saw what I thought was a satellite once, but I couldn't look at it because I'm scared.  It's scary.  All right.  So, why don't we get the gang in here?  Satellite.  No.  All right.  Bring them in.  Where's my scripts?  I don't know.  We're getting it all together because Ben's in the emergency room or something today. 
[02:38:00]  So, we're making this up as we go along.  Look who it is.  Pat from Anaki.  Oh, Pat's freaking out.  He's ready to kill himself because he's been sitting out there with that collection.  Well, they've been all hanging out together.  The freaks of the show, they're on a couple couches outside the studio, and they're all  looking like they're the only one that's normal.  That's what's really funny about this.  Yeah, that is funny.  They come in and go, oh, those nuts out there.  No, you're nuts, too.  That's what my brother said, huh?  Get it?  Relative? 
[02:38:30]  Never mind.  So, we got Pat from Anaki in the studio.  Pat, how have you been?  Oh, I've been just wonderful, just hanging out with my friends out there.  Pat, can I ask you a question?  Have you lost weight?  You lost weight.  Exactly what I was thinking.  A couple little pounds there.  I've noticed.  No, not a couple.  I think you lost a lot of weight.  A couple of LBs?  Yeah.  How much have you lost?  My gut to my ass.  How much weight have you lost?  Maybe 20 pounds. 
[02:39:00]  20?  Yeah.  That's a good dump for me.  Are you on a diet?  Are you trying to lose weight?  Yeah, a little bit of an Atkins type thing.  Yeah?  No bread.  No bread.  No more hot dog buns.  No?  You're just eating meat?  Yeah.  You've got a healthiness to the skin on your face.  He's trying to be sexy.  You look youthful.  I think he's going for something here.  Step over here a minute.  You've absolutely lost weight.  Your head isn't as fat. 
[02:39:30]  Your profile is a little slimmer.  We should do Opie and Anthony Fit Club.  Oh, wow.  We got these two.  Yeah, well, congratulations.  Thank you.  There's the Pat from Menachie update.  Very nice.  When's your second CD coming out?  Never.  All right.  And now...  Never.  And now our latest find, it's the Big A, everyone.  Andrew, right?  No?  Alvin, what's your name?  No, it's Andrew. 
[02:40:00]  Andrew.  Andrew, the Big A.  Yes.  How you been?  Not bad.  Yeah?  Not bad at all.  Working hard?  I'm trying to.  Yeah?  Isn't this like taking a lot of time away from work, though, when you come in here?  Oh, I'd rather come in here than be on my job, so...  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm having fun hanging out with you guys.  Are you a little nervous today?  A little bit.  Yeah.  He's the guy that drives the cab in the Bronx, but he's nervous when he's on our show. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  But you, um...  You're not losing out on a lot of money or anything.  This isn't going to fuck up your life.  Like Patty.  Patty went through a phase where she was so dedicated to the show, so obsessed with the  show, that she pretty much blew off everything and ended up homeless.  And living at the studio.  Yeah, living under the stairs at the studio.  With her stuffed rabbit, if you remember.  Yeah.  So we don't want anything like that happening.  This isn't going to cut into your income. 
[02:41:00]  Not at all, no.  Okay.  You do all right?  You got money in the bank or anything?  Not really, but...  Not really.  Hey, Andrew.  Yes.  Boo!  It didn't work.  Actually got me.  Scared the shit out of me, too.  You can't scare him with a boo.  Nah.  You can't scare him with a pipe swing at his head.  No, not when you drive a cab up there.  He lives the Grand Theft Auto game every single day.  Jesus.  You see the hookers and stuff when you're driving your cab?  Sometimes. 
[02:41:30]  See him, he kills him.  I don't like how he's laughing at that joke.  It's funny and all, but there's something behind that laugh.  His side job is he works for a vet, and he just smothers the animals when it's time to put them down.  Save your money on the anesthesia.  That's to keep them under control.  He pinches their little animal noses until they stop kicking.  He pinches them shut.  It's the government program we don't know about.  All right, why don't we invite somebody else in here?  Who else do you want to say hi to? 
[02:42:00]  All right, we got this lovely couple you might remember.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Paul.  How are you?  I walked in waving like he was making a stage appearance.  Yeah, hey.  How you doing, everybody?  Where's the other mic?  I'm the only normal person here waving.  Wow, huh?  I don't know about it.  Paul and his lovely wife with the huge cans.  Hey, guys.  They're going headphones up.  I forget your name.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, yeah, Denise.  I'm sorry.  I just want to be, you know, polite.  I don't like being rude on this show. 
[02:42:30]  It's Paul and Denise, everyone.  I like calling her the old colored guy blower.  She's past that now.  She wants a pure white.  Yeah.  So I guess for her.  Oh, God.  He goes right for it, doesn't he?  Well, I'm going to get like two minutes on the mic.  Fucking Sandy Kim's back in.  I apologize to all the shogies that are listening to the program today.  Hey, what has happened since your appearance on the show?  Any updates?  Well, she blew me in the Lincoln Tunnel on the way home to finish the job. 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  That worked out pretty well.  I was quite happy.  Nice.  Really?  Yeah, it was.  It was good.  Did he finish before the toll?  No, I had to prove myself that I could get it up.  I started my order for that stuff yet.  Yeah.  But did you finish in the tunnel or outside the toll booth?  How far did you make it?  Yeah, it was the smaller tunnel.  Yeah.  And does his bag still smell?  Be honest, Denise.  Scary paws.  Well, actually, that's getting better, but he has a problem today.  He has itchy balls.  Itchy balls?  Yeah.  Why do you have itchy balls, Paul? 
[02:43:30]  Ash, you can use that dollar store fucking stuff on clothes, man.  And my ball sack's been itching all morning.  Well, give me more money, you'll get better detergents.  Patty keeps looking at me like I'm excited by her.  Yeah, what do you use?  Right now?  Yeah.  Whatever I can afford.  Oh, is that it?  On his budget is a dollar, so it's dollars for detergents.  He doesn't blow me again, so you won't get any more spending money.  You've got to rinse those things twice.  Like, rinse the underwear twice.  No, I like to see him suffer.  Because I know, I went through a phase where I think it was the bleach or something.  You walk around and you start itching and going, what the fuck? 
[02:44:00]  I got the crabs or something?  And no, turns out to be, yeah, detergent on your goddamn undies.  Oh, you're a black guy.  Car crash.  What does that even mean?  You know how the black fellas do this shit?  They grab their crap and walk around?  What kind of underwear are you wearing?  You do that all the time.  No, I should be wearing boxers.  They're the old little...  Hey, Andrew.  Andrew, what do you think of these two?  Heidi Whitey's?  Yeah, you faggot.  Some awful underwear.  What do you think of these two? 
[02:44:30]  Very interesting.  Oh.  At best.  Paul, what do you think of all these people you've been hanging out with this morning?  Oh, nearly everybody's cool, except for Sandy Kane, she's a total cunt.  Frenchy actually turned out to be pretty cool.  I'm pretty happy, you know, that he got the Olympics and all.  I noticed something else going on here.  It looks like, Denise, did you, and be honest, did you bronze up your boobs today for your appearance?  No.  I've been laying out in the sun.  It looks like a little bronzing powder or something on them.  They're nice and shiny and...  No, actually, well, I started using a new lotion. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  A bronzing lotion.  Maybe that's it.  It is a bronzing lotion.  Very nice.  Let's get Frenchy in here.  New lotion.  We got Frenchy.  No one shoves their cock in your mouth while you're laying out, do they?  It seems whatever she's doing.  What?  Someone just walks up.  You don't want to stand next to who?  Who do you think?  Frenchy?  Who do I think?  It could be anyone.  I don't know.  He can come by me.  I don't mind him.  No, who don't you like?  Oh, Sandy.  I thought you were bringing Sandy back in.  What's wrong with Sandy?  I don't know. 
[02:45:30]  She's just, like, turning my stomach today.  Why?  I don't know.  You mean, why?  Look at her, stupid.  What?  Look at her, stupid.  Have you guys seen Twado yet?  You guys haven't seen Twado?  I wish that she will puke if she sees that song.  No, you gotta see Twado.  Yeah, I gotta see that.  Everyone sees Twado.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of us.  Everyone sees Twado.  That's just the fucking way it is.  That's right.  Frenchy?  I thought she died from that shit yet.  I thought she died from that shit yet.  Fuck off, you, you fuck.  Who are you cursing out? 
[02:46:00]  Me.  Fucking British morons, man.  Oh, shut up, you faggot.  The only reason my wife's sitting next to you is because she thinks you're a faggot.  You little bitch.  Fuck off, you little whore.  Please, I'd rather have my wife suck another Negro's dick than go near you.  You stupid motherfucking...  Talking to motherfuckers, is your mom coming over again tomorrow?  He never has anything.  We got a Brit and a Frenchman.  You don't have what it takes to take on this guy.  You know that.  Because he's a fucking British moron.  He's driving the wrong side of the street.  He likes cocking his mouth.  How can he compete with me? 
[02:46:30]  And you like it up your ass, you fag.  He belongs in the camp.  That's your mom with a strap on.  Up your ass anyway, you moron.  Paul could be one of the quickest guys we've had on the show.  You can't... I'm telling you, Frenchy, you've met your match with this guy.  The only time I'm not quick is with ten guys with camcorders looking at me and me getting blown under the console.  That's never going to happen.  Except Jimmy's there.  You're quick to fail.  Yeah, exactly.  I gave up before they put me on the fucking...  So there's...  That's a tough one, no, man.  None of us could have got around with that.  So Frenchy and Paul, you're not going to become Frenchy? 
[02:47:00]  I'm going to try, but I don't think so because it's fucking British.  They stole the games out of us, man.  Well, actually, I love going around with Frenchy because, you know, my chances of getting laid go up to Stadbury when there's a gay guy hanging around.  You're a jackass, man.  Is that the best you got?  Yeah, I got more for you.  Don't you fucking worry, bitch.  Yeah, I bet you have to put it in my ass, shit dick.  Oh, he's getting a good smashing.  That's right.  Go ahead, Frenchy.  Sit on it, you fucking bitch.  Stop offering me stuff, dude. 
[02:47:30]  Give him your best, Frenchy.  Come on, Frenchy.  Actually, I think he gave it to me outside.  Used the way he wanted to, though.  You sort of impressed us the other day.  You came back in our eyes a little bit.  Yeah.  So, you know, you've got to keep moving forward here.  You came in your forehead.  Someone's pointed out this is the...  Came back in our eyes.  Someone has pointed out that this is the second appearance by Paul on the show and the second bombing in London.  It was the same day.  Oh, really?  Wow.  What's going on there, Paul?  I don't know about that.  Maybe you have something to do with this whole thing. 
[02:48:00]  When he shows up on the show, it's like a code, maybe.  Yeah, do I look Pakistani to you?  What the fuck is up with those fucking smutty motherfuckers?  God.  They're like, oh shit, what should we do?  Should we buy some soap or bomb a train?  Hmm.  Let's get stalker Patty in here.  She's wearing, like, hot pants or something.  Ooh.  Patty.  Yeah.  And they're pulled up to her gut.  Patty, you're getting a belly out of here.  You're eating too much of the chocolate. 
[02:48:30]  I've never seen Daisy Dukes on a turnip before.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Didn't we talk about our Daisy Dukes once?  What do we call them?  Daisy don'ts?  Pull them down a little bit, will you?  No, those are Al Dukes.  Yeah, Al Dukes.  And then we called them David Dukes.  And that was a funny one.  That's the second time I missed a funny one.  David.  David Dukes.  Especially at Paul in studio.  How did I forget David Dukes? 
[02:49:00]  Of course.  Racist bastard.  Well, Patty, you look stunning today.  I think I look good for my age.  Is that a hundred?  Yeah.  Well, divide it by two.  Sadie said she looked good in them hot pants.  I really don't think that's a compliment.  Is it?  Come on.  God, Paul, he is quick.  Paul, you are really quick.  I love you.  Now, why aren't we going to arrange a little get-together with Patty?  Why aren't you going to go out with Big A?  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Are you going to go out on a date with Big A?  We were going to set something up, Big A.  You remember that?  Say yes.  Yes.  Can I be his translator today?  And you still have no problem with that if we hook you two up?  Go out to dinner?  Okay.  Yeah.  He gave his number to Sandy.  I did not.  He gave his number to Sandy outside.  He did.  I swear to God.  I did not.  Sandy's got to show you something, though.  No, no, no.  She offered herself to him.  Let's get that.  Really?  She said that if Andrew gave him the pictures he took because you smashed her camera, she 
[02:50:00]  would give him a blowjob in exchange.  You want a blowjob to Andrew?  She offered.  No.  He didn't accept.  I don't close him.  She would definitely do it for you.  Yeah, she certainly would.  Oh, no.  Then she said, even if you don't give me the pictures, I'll give you a blowjob.  There's nice ratty teeth wrapped around it.  All right, let's get Sandy Kane.  You should have something up, too.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right, let's get Sandy Kane in here.  Those are deserved. 
[02:50:30]  Here's your thing.  The last member of the Fantastic Seven.  Look at this crew.  My side dig, Dildo.  Six foot one removed.  We're all the thing.  The only black in the room.  Because the black doesn't show the dirt.  All right, Travis, you're going to control that mic.  And if you don't, there's going to be hell to pay after the show.  The League of Extraordinary Retards.  That's what I mean.  That's what I'm getting at.  Yeah, the League of Extraordinary Retards.  That's going to be a great Photoshop.  We've got to get a group shot of you guys so they can Photoshop the shit out of you. 
[02:51:00]  The League of Extraordinary Retards.  Come on.  Come on.  You're lumped into it.  Deal with it.  Don't put us in with her for fucks.  Now we've got to figure out what their superpowers are.  Oh, well.  We know she has the power.  She has the power of Twado.  Right, the power of Twado.  Dick power.  Dick power.  No, it's the power of Twado.  I don't know what it does.  It squirts out disease.  It makes criminals vomit until the police show up and arrest them. 
[02:51:30]  That's very good.  She just shows him Twado and the criminals start barfing and it's over.  All right.  I don't like the way that she's between us and the fucking door.  All right.  This is what I'm going to do here.  I'm thinking.  I want everyone.  I want.  They have to all see Twado.  Who hasn't seen Twado?  We've all seen it.  Yeah, I swear to God.  No.  Be honest.  None of them really have.  I've seen it in my nightmares.  All right.  So no one has really seen Twado in the studio, okay?  For the new listeners, this is an amazing thing.  It's a genital wart, but she will not admit that. 
[02:52:00]  Okay.  But it's giant.  It's giant.  It's almost like as big as your ear or half of your ear, I would say.  The worst thing is, the best analogy to it is such an obscure thing.  You remember a couple of years back, they grew an ear on the back of a mouse and it was  supposed to be some kind of a study they're doing to grow limbs and organs and tissue  for people.  Sure.  It looks just like the ear they were growing on the mouse's back and it's right on her pubic  mound to one side. 
[02:52:30]  I believe your left, it's on your left side.  It's on my left, yes.  And it's right in the middle of her thatch.  Right.  My snatch.  No, your thatch of hair.  It's thatch.  Thatch is so like thin and mangy.  Usually they call it a snatch.  I don't...  That it shows up really easily.  And it's too big.  It flaps around.  Picture up.  Take a couple of pieces of hubba-bubba bubblegum.  Chew it up.  And then mold it into some weird shape and just stick it on your pubic hair.  That's what it looks like. 
[02:53:00]  Stick it on your snatch.  There.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  So this is what's going to happen.  Yuck.  This is what's going to happen.  You're leaving out of a snatch.  Yeah, but it didn't look like yours, does it?  Fuck.  How do you know?  You haven't seen it yet.  I can imagine.  Look at the rest of you.  Well, you know, I mean, the most beautiful dick I ever saw was on a very ugly guy.  So you don't know what someone's packing down there.  I'm with Paul.  I can't say if you have a big dick or a small one.  He's got a small one.  Even though you haven't seen it, motherfucker.  Well, you know, I really maybe don't want...  But, you know, your wife is gorgeous, and she has the most beautiful big titties that 
[02:53:30]  make mine look like fried eggs.  Can she lick your twotto?  Doesn't she have big tits, man?  They are big, man.  Is that a $100 bill, Sandy?  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  Where'd you get that?  Ten years of stripping.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  Would you like to see it?  No, no, no.  You can keep it.  I'm just wondering, where do you get your money?  Well, where do I get my money?  Well, truthfully, I was taping a TV show, and a guy gave me... 
[02:54:00]  What do you mean?  Where do you get your money for day-to-day operations, for paying the rent, for...  God, God.  God.  I pray.  That's why I'm a Jew, but I wear a cross.  No, but I got...  Jesus.  Sandy.  I'm telling you, man.  Ever since I believe in Jesus, I have money.  Where does it come from?  God.  It's delivered to you?  Yes.  And it's, you know, indirectly.  You earn your money somewhere.  God led me.  You're full of shit.  You earn your money somewhere, but you're not fessing up to it.  What do you do for a living? 
[02:54:30]  I'll bet you it's, uh...  What do old people collect?  Social Security.  Oh, please.  Is it your Social Security money?  No.  Social Security?  I'm not that old.  You certainly are.  Fuck you, man.  Fuck you, man.  I like that, man.  Look at him.  Like you're George Clooney or something.  You're old and you collect Social Security.  Don't be ashamed of that.  Hey, fuck you, man.  I mean, how can you say that?  You're 68 years old.  Oh, fuck you.  What's wrong with that?  Hit him over the head with your dildo.  I wouldn't take that, Sandy. 
[02:55:00]  At least I have hair.  Yeah, it's a wig, stupid.  Yeah, I have long hair down to my hemorrhoid.  Yeah, she's got something going on in the back door that she claims is a hemorrhoid, but  we think it's another general wart.  Can you show...  You have to show them...  Yeah, this is what I want to do.  Oh, Sandy, yeah.  I want these guys to look at it.  It looks like an animal wart that got lost.  I want these guys, and this is where we need...  Well, you know, I mean, can I come back and do a song one of these days?  Yeah, shut up.  Travis, take the mic away from her.  Where's Eric?  I really need someone to control what's going on here in the studio besides Travis. 
[02:55:30]  This is what's going to happen.  It's very easy.  Listen, Eric.  So she...  I want all these guys...  Very good.  I want all these guys to turn around, and I want one by one to turn around and see Twato  so we can get the reaction of each individual in the studio, all right?  Hey, you know...  All right, Travis, now you can mic Sandy Kane again.  Hello?  I mean...  All right, so everyone has turned around.  Come on, you guys.  Weinstein.  You guys got to play along because you haven't seen Twato.  I'm just saying, can I come back and do one of my songs? 
[02:56:00]  Yes, I promise you can do one of your songs.  Yes, yes, yes.  That'll be the showstopper.  I promise.  Yeah.  All right, Sandy, now take off your...  All right.  Yeah, Sandy.  Only, you know...  Nice.  Take off those...  All the listeners have heard that Obie has said I can come back and do it.  Right.  We love that song.  I want to hear the Cox song.  Sandy, you're going to come back and do a song.  You, man.  I promise.  Wow.  She is pissed at you, Jimmy.  She hates when you bring up her age because she wants to be...  Well, it takes about her age.  It's fine.  She wants to be young forever.  So what?  She's 60 years old.  So what? 
[02:56:30]  I'm not...  How do you know I'm 60?  I already...  I know you are.  You collect Social Security.  We saw your license once.  You're an asshole, man.  We saw your license once.  You're way up there.  I'm just saying.  We look like assholes, man.  Let's get going.  Hey, fuck you, asshole, too, man.  Why don't you get a wig?  Ooh.  Get your fucking pants off, you horse.  You four-eyed piece of shit.  You're a four-eyed piece of shit, man.  Ooh.  At least I don't need glasses.  Ooh, that's right.  You don't need glasses.  Everyone's old in their own way.  That's right.  You're just old in actual years.  All right.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:57:00]  Sandy, take your pants off.  Take your pants off.  That's why I bring my bodyguard here.  Sandy, you know what?  You're wasting time.  And I'll tell you right now, if we run out of show...  No song.  No song.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Hey, dildo.  Ew, you touched it.  You actually touched it.  Eric threw the dildo in the toilet.  He's going to get a genital wart.  In the toilet.  He should have bit it, and the dildo went in.  If Mike and Mike is listening, I love you, Mike.  All right.  Drop those pants.  Very nice.  There we go.  Shut up.  Just take your pants off. 
[02:57:30]  Get ready for twaddle.  Just take your pants off.  People are sick of you, too.  Shut up.  No one has said it to you since 1961.  Take your pants off.  Hey, Sandy, are you on the Century 6 tape there, too?  Aren't you?  That shit's fucking positive, huh?  You're a bald-headed piece of shit.  I want a bald-headed piece of shit.  You're almost there.  You're almost there.  God, I have long, gorgeous hair.  How long does he take you?  I don't need glasses.  All right.  Right.  You guys are real assholes.  Send them back to England.  You're right, Sandy.  That was fucking Frenchie, you cunt.  What is your... 
[02:58:00]  You stupid fucking twat.  That was Frenchie.  The English love that word.  Why does your twat look like it's going through chemo?  You're a bloody asshole.  Whoa, is that the best you got?  Will you take your panties off?  Jesus.  Throw her up.  She's fucking terrible.  Normally, she takes her pants off in like 10 fucking seconds.  I'm a little nervous here.  The panties got to come off.  Fuck you.  The panties got to come off.  Oh, God.  All right, take your panties off.  Oh, no.  Take them off.  Oh, no.  Shut your horn.  No, no, no, no.  Twato's the right.  I'm not showing my pussy.  I'm not showing my pussy.  Oh, shit. 
[02:58:30]  I've got to get paid to show my pussy.  Is there anyone here that can control this bitch?  I can't look at this.  Now we're wasting time.  I'm going to just say, I'm not showing my whole pussy.  Throw her out.  Sandy, stand up next against that wall.  All right?  Who wants to see Twato first?  We need a volunteer.  No, over there.  Mike?  Mike Sandy?  Look at the penis.  Can my hand be any lower?  Over there.  Over there.  She doesn't take direction very well.  She stinks.  This could be her last appearance on the show.  It's frustrating.  She doesn't listen.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Who wants to take a look?  Don't take the pants off.  You can't see it like that.  She'll pull it aside.  Yeah, she's going to have to pull it aside.  All right.  Let's start.  I don't know.  All right.  Denise, Paul's wife.  Denise.  That sucks.  Pull that aside, Sandy.  Denise, don't cover it with your hand.  Leave your hand away from it.  All right, Denise, walk toward Sandy Kane and take a look at Twato.  You're spilling it.  I'm sorry, Jim.  Here's the natural reaction.  This is Denise looking at Twato for the first time.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't look at that. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Did you look?  Yeah, yeah.  What does it look like?  It's like a clitoris running off.  Doesn't it give you the heebie-jeebies?  What does it look like, Denise?  You know what?  There's no words for it.  It's disgusting looking.  There's no words for that.  Did you pinch it between your fingers?  No.  To tell you, if I had something like that down there on me, I would never take my underpants  off.  It'd be hot.  Never.  Paul, did you look?  Next.  I would be a queen of masturbation.  All right.  Let's start with...  Well, I am a queen of masturbation, so I have a dildo with me. 
[03:00:00]  I can see why.  I can see why.  Denise is very annoyed by what she saw.  All right.  Let's go with the big A.  The big A's next.  Big A.  Big A.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Pull those panties aside, but don't cover up with your hand.  All right.  Ready, Andrew?  Take a look at Twado for the first time.  Oh, my God.  Let's have oral sex.  Let's not.  Didn't stutter that time.  Let's not.  What is the problem?  What do you think?  What do you think, Andrew? 
[03:00:30]  Let's have oral sex, Andy.  You're my type.  Can I sit on your face?  Shut up.  I love you.  I can't.  Andrew, what do you think?  It's disgusting.  Oh, my God.  You don't like me.  I don't like Twado.  No.  Would you go down on her, big A?  Of course not.  No.  No?  Something smells like sour milk in here.  That's her underpants, dude.  Ugh.  All right.  I'm going to have to spray.  Thank you, Andrew.  Okay.  All right.  Who's next? 
[03:01:00]  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  All right.  Frenchie's up.  Frenchie's up.  Frenchie's seen Twado for the first time.  Go ahead, Frenchie.  He hasn't seen fucking...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It looks like a dick-growing, man.  That's what I thought.  Actually, I thought it was like a dick.  It is.  It is.  You thought it was like a little penis?  I thought it was like a dick.  Yeah, I really did.  I thought it was like the start of the head of a penis.  I...  That's...  Frenchie's got wood.  Oh.  Yeah, right.  My fucking balls, right?  What is this, man?  What is this?  Mike or Travis, is he trying to improv? 
[03:01:30]  What is it?  Yeah.  What is it?  I don't really know what it is.  It's just one day it was there.  No, I was shaving my pussy, and then it happened, so I never shaved my pussy anymore.  Your pubic hair goes for like a foot wide.  It's like a foot wide.  Don't I have a big vagina?  It's huge.  I mean, I know.  It looks psycho.  You have a very well-endowed family.  Okay, I think you should retire.  I think it's time for you to stop to do this shit, because this is...  I think you should learn how to speak English, man.  I have never seen anything like this.  Yeah, look at you.  Why don't you get a wig?  You cook things like that.  Look at how balls you do.  I don't need a wig. 
[03:02:00]  When I see what you got down there, Jesus fucking Christ, I would open the fucking window  and jump, man.  Do ourselves a favor.  Just jump out of the fucking window.  I think you should...  If you accompany me...  God damn it, man.  Look at him.  He can't get his eyes off of me.  Ah!  See?  You transfixed.  Let's move on.  He used to have something, but...  Wait, Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  French here's nothing.  Stalker Patty.  You've seen Twaddle, though, no?  Yeah.  All right, take a note.  Well, just from looking in in the studio, but it really...  Patty's thinking it would look delicious dipped in Godiva chocolate. 
[03:02:30]  No.  No.  No.  Chocolate-covered wart.  I want to bite that with my molars and just...  Oh!  All right, what do you think?  Patty, what do you think?  Just bite the stem of it.  I'm going to the doctor and getting an operation or something.  Right.  I would never be a guest on this show without Twaddle.  What do you think, Patty?  It's something...  What does it look like?  It needs attention, definitely medical attention.  It needs attention? 
[03:03:00]  No.  That's abnormal.  That's all I could say is abnormal.  So are you.  I think you need attention.  There's something not right.  Stalker Patty.  All right.  Let's go to Pat from Menachie.  Oh, I'm last.  Pat.  Pat.  Dead man walking.  Here comes Pat from Menachie.  He's going to...  Looks like the 10th toe.  He's going to look at...  Oh.  Stalker...  He's going to look at the...  Goddamn line!  He's going to look at Sandy Kane's...  Twato.  Twato.  Twato.  Ever seen anything like that?  There's my toe. 
[03:03:30]  Are you joking at all?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm scared.  I bet he's good at oral sex.  Oh.  Yeah, you've never seen anything like that before.  No, never.  Hold on, Pat.  I had a line.  Go ahead, Pat.  What?  You had a line.  Oh, there's my toe.  Is there an echo in here?  All right, there you go.  And finally, Paul.  Paul's looking at Twato for the first time. 
[03:04:00]  St. Paul.  St. Paul.  St. Paul.  What do you think?  Go on, babe.  You love me.  That is...  That is fucking disgusting.  Holy shit.  How the fuck do you ever make money as a whore?  That has got to be the reason they invented the no-refund rule, right, Jim?  Well, I always have sex in the dark.  That's probably why, aren't you?  Yeah, the guy's probably left and you haven't figured it out yet.  As long as they leave the green, baby.  How the fuck would you feel when you couldn't...  A fucking black guy with 12 inches, you couldn't feel when that fucking gaping gash. 
[03:04:30]  I got nothing to say.  I just...  Dildo.  Dildo.  Don't be offended.  Okay.  Dildo.  I'm not touching that.  You're a cunt.  Are you fucking serious?  No, it was every time.  That was a white one until she put it in a box.  Of course.  Look at the fucking...  Look at that fucking...  Oh, he's touching it.  Don't go in the garbage.  What is that bit?  Is that so it rubs twilight while you're fucking the other side of it?  Hey, put it in your ass.  I'm touching her.  Paul.  She's fucking smelling it.  Paul.  All kidding aside, we've watched her put that in her butt. 
[03:05:00]  In her ass.  No, no, no, no.  Drop it.  Anyone go somewhere like a melt this fucking thing?  No, please don't.  Ah!  Dildo.  Best one ever.  Best one ever.  Out the fucking window.  No, no, no.  Hey.  Yeah.  Out the window.  Paul.  No.  It's fucking on.  Danny.  Oh, there's a fight.  Wow.  Danny.  Danny's going to fucking kill you.  Oh, my God.  Wow, Danny got really pissed. 
[03:05:30]  He put the thing right in Danny's face.  And Danny just lost it.  You all right, Danny?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  All right.  Danny's going to kill you.  Hey, Jim, could you pick that up, please?  Oh, my God.  Roll over my dildo.  I don't even want to step on it.  Of course not.  I'll throw it out the window.  He touched it.  All right.  He's a bit upset because I fucking went towards him when he was shaking.  We have to break this.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going to take a break.  What are they called again?  The League of...  The League of Extraordinary Retards. 
[03:06:00]  There you have it.  We've got to get a group picture outside the studio.  We've got to get it all nice for the...  Get them all out of here.  For the pest that'll photoshop the shit out of this picture.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony, huh?  Yeah.  Get them out of here.  Yeah.  Can we get everyone out of the studio?  Please.  Please.  Come on.  Move.  Move.  Come.  Move.  They're ushering him out.  Move.  It's like moving cattle around.  Yeah, we're going to go outside.  Keep it up.  Give me my...  They're taking a picture outside.  You come back.  Leave it.  I want my fucking vibrator, baby. 
[03:06:30]  Go over there.  I don't know.  All right.  She's picking up her...  I know you like him.  Oh, Jesus.  Get away from me.  All right.  Just get away from me.  I've never seen anybody so devoid of any entertainment value.  Whatsoever.  We have to break that dildo.  Yeah, dildo.  We have to smash dildo.  Did you hear that scream she let out when they threw it in the garbage?  Oh, my God.  It's better than any one we have.  That's close, but that one's even better. 
[03:07:00]  How can we break it?  We'll figure it out during the break, I guess.  So what we're going to do, I think we're going to have these guys try to do, like,  movie lines or something.  Yeah.  Like a scene from famous movies.  I got an example of a famous scene from Platoon, actually, just to set up the bit.  We're going to break here.  Holy shit. 
[03:07:30]  You see that fucking hat, Ben?  Come aboard, Ben.  You fuckers.  All right, Terry, get us out of here.  Herc, jerk, herc, jerk, herc, jerk.  Ben Sparks is herky jerky.  Wave his arms around like he's herky jerky.  Compulsing on the ground because he's herky jerky.  You know that he don't give a fuck.  He's herky jerky.  Don't mistake him for a bum.  O.T.ing on some drugs. 
[03:08:00]  He's moving all around because Ben Sparks is what he does.  He's in a gossiping because he needs to know the buzz.  And giggling like a girl motherfucker just because.  He's a man about town, part of parties on the street.  Unless he's had some crazy insane sushi to eat.  Then here comes Gravy Leg.  Better move out the way.  He'll be going through a pound of toilet paper in a day.  And looking at his hair is going to make you stop and think.  Did he wipe it on the floor after someone spilled a drink?  If you watch how he moves, he'll be picking.  He is smoking a crack.  Herky jerky on the phone.  Smaller than a Tic Tac in studio. 
[03:08:30]  He'll be yawning during O&A show.  Because all night he's been chatting about Tom Brady doing flow.  Back and bossing them drunk.  So tell you Ben's wicked bitch, sir.  Because Ben heard Kurt Schilling had sex with his sister.  Ben's mule is scary, man.  He's got Superman jugs.  He's a-looking being like a cancerous lump.  Now Ben is rave.  Yelling at Jim, yelling at O.  Dude, relax.  Just concentrate on doing a fucking show.  That's crazy insane.  That's crazy, that's crazy insane.  It's nuts.  Dude, dude, did I tell you about Tom Brady doing blow-offs?  This bitch is back.  It was fucking great.  We're all in a fucking club drinking fucking coffee.  Dude, dude, do you like my new hairstyle?  It's called the Hurricaniac. 
[03:09:00]  Opio.  I was just fucking yawning.  I didn't have any sleep.  I was out looking at Bono under the fucking bridge.  It was fucking crazy insane.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  Anyway, so I walked in and I was like, oh, no.  And I'm like, I had one black person.  And I was like, oh, there's no music.  There's like some cheese laid out.  And my friend's talking to K-Rock in there.  And it's like, I start cranking up his show a little bit.  Whoa, there's a baby that lives downstairs.  There you go.  It will be an Anthony show. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  Tomorrow on the show, Anthony.  Yes.  Brand new news teases.  One of my favorite, favorite things we do on the program.  News teases. 
[03:10:00]  We'll do that tomorrow.  Very cool.  Yeah, I love those.  And other things, I guess.  Other things.  Can't get Ben on the line.  He's in surgery.  No, he's just getting his ankle checked out from a mishap this morning.  He's probably the last on the list of people to help in that hospital.  If you come in and say your Anki hurts, they're going to make you sit for a day while gunshot victims come wheeling through. 
[03:10:30]  So we can't get him on the phone.  No, Steve?  Anything?  I've been trying.  His phone goes right into.  That might be him.  Oh, is it?  Let's see.  Yes, it is.  Oh, take the call.  Take it on the air.  What's up, dude?  We're just talking about you.  Hold the mic up.  We're just talking about you.  How are you?  You just finally got out?  Put the ear thing there.  Can't hear.  I can't hear.  Can't hear. 
[03:11:00]  You got a bandage on it?  Bandage.  We lost the executive producer of the show today so we could go get a bandage on his ankle.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you call the hotline?  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  No problem, man.  What's the deal?  They bandaged it up.  He just had to wait a while.  He took some x-rays.  And he's going to call in, like, a couple minutes.  He's just going into Duane Reade, I guess, to get a prescription filled.  It took him a while because his hog donated blood for all the victims of the London bombing. 
[03:11:30]  Nothing?  His hog donated blood for all the victims of the London bombing?  Well, it was a little wordy.  It was a little wordy.  Well, no, there's a new one today.  It didn't bomb, though, was it?  Yes, there was.  My material's just too new for everybody.  Wait, there was a bombing today?  I know there's a problem.  I didn't know there was actually a bomb went off.  Three blasts at London subway station, one on a bus.  And it's brand new.  And they were smaller devices, so they didn't do as much damage, but there are some injuries. 
[03:12:00]  Probably not suicide bombings.  All right.  Probably not.  Let's do this movie-like thing.  So, basically, we got some scripts from some famous movies and, you know, famous scenes from movies.  Yes.  And we're going to, like, pair up these wackos and see how it would sound with them doing the movie loss.  Oh, he got a bandage.  Huh?  Couldn't he have gone after?  Got a band-aid.  No, that's...  Ah, I'm injured.  Ah, I don't. 
[03:12:30]  He says he's calling the show, but you watch, he will not call the show.  Because, you know, now the excuse is he's going into Dwayne Reed to get the prescription filled.  What did he get?  And then it's going to be like, well, there's a long line at Dwayne Reed.  Should I ask him what he got?  Painkiller?  I had to get condoms, and his size is a special-made order only.  Special-made order.  Ah.  Ah.  I think the old Ben's hog bit might be done.  Oh, no.  There's more.  I just tripped on it.  All right.  So, uh, what's the deal here?  What do you guys want to do?  Special order. 
[03:13:00]  You got an idea, Eric?  Based on the scenes and the characters.  How about it's a microphone?  All right.  So we got, uh, Anthony, we got scripts for Reservoir Dogs.  I see that right here.  I saw one for The Shining.  Um, we got The Shining.  Uh, Pulp Fiction.  What do you guys want to hear first?  Off his face.  Ed Wood.  King of Comedy.  Which one is The Shining?  Jaws.  It's the famous scene with Grady and Jack in the bathroom.  Jaws, Goodfellas, Ed Wood, no. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  We got, uh, we got some to choose from.  Yep.  We got, like, uh, I'm thinking, if you guys are with me, we got a scene from Reservoir Dogs,  The Shining, Pulp Fiction, Jaws, and Goodfellas.  That's a good, good mix of, uh, of scenes from movies, okay?  Wow.  This Reservoir Dogs is like five people involved in this scene.  Oh, really?  Ooh, that ought to be nice and confusing.  These mutants.  All right, maybe we'll save that one for last.  You want to start with The Shining? 
[03:14:00]  Uh, why not?  I got that one right in front of me.  All right, we have to cast Grady and Jack for this, uh, for this reading.  If we use Paul as Grady, he won't even need a script.  Um, so.  Yeah, all right.  That's just how he talks.  You don't want Paul?  I don't think so.  Not for Grady.  All right, well, who would fit the role?  Uh, let's see.  Grady.  Uh, big guy.  Andrew.  Um, yeah.  Andrew would be a good Grady.  I think Andrew would probably be a good Grady, too.  All right, let's go with Andrew as Grady, and who's going to play Jack? 
[03:14:30]  How about Pat from Munaki?  Yeah, okay.  That's a good combination right there.  There you go.  All right, bring in, uh, Andrew.  The big A.  And Pat from Munaki.  It's a short one, unfortunately, but.  Well, there's a, no, it gets a little wordy at the end.  Yeah, and they both have some great dialogue in there.  Yeah.  All right.  Um, the big A and Pat from Munaki in studio to do a scene from The Shining.  Yeah.  Now, uh, big A, you will be playing the part of Grady. 
[03:15:00]  So you're going to read all the highlighted, uh, dialogue.  Grady is the, uh, butler guy.  Well, what would his, uh, position be called?  He was, uh, the, the, the British, uh, he was like a maitre d'.  A maitre d'.  Yeah, want to set up the scene for the, the, the.  Oh, fantastic.  You know the movie so well.  Yes.  This isn't a love scene, is it?  No, no.  No, you are Jack.  You're Jack.  Who, of course, remember Jack Nicholson playing.  And this is the scene inside the bathroom.  Uh, Grady has, uh, inadvertently dumped something on Jack. 
[03:15:30]  Little avocat.  And, uh, they've gone into the bathroom to clean off his jacket.  And, uh, in the bathroom, um, it's kind of exposed that Grady might have done some evil  things beforehand, uh, and he gives Jack some words of advice on how to take care of some  business with his, his family.  Anthony, I didn't know we have the actual scene.  Oh, so we get to play the scene.  Yeah, and then we get to hear how they, uh, interpret it.  Oh, and this will give you, uh, a line on how it's done. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, so, great.  So, give these guys headphones so they can listen very closely.  Here's the scene they're going to be doing from The Shining.  I had no idea we had the actual scene.  Now, make sure you pay attention to inflection and little, uh, uh, delays and, and this scene  is everything.  This scene's going to bring a lot of things together as far as the show goes.  That's true.  Thank God.  On a daily basis.  All right, here's the famous scene from The Shining that these guys quote over and over  and over again on the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[03:16:30]  Did you know, Mr. Torrance, that your son is attempting to bring an outside party into this  situation?  Did you know that?  No.  He is, Mr. Torrance.  Who?  A nigger. 
[03:17:00]  A nigger?  A nigger cook.  Now, your son has a very great talent.  I don't think you are aware how great it is. 
[03:17:30]  Great.  But he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.  Great.  He is a very willful boy.  Indeed, he is, Mr. Torrance.  A very willful boy. 
[03:18:00]  A rather naughty boy, if I may be so, Bolson.  It's his mother.  It's his mother.  She interferes.  Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. 
[03:18:30]  Talking to?  Perhaps a bit more.  Talking to, axe.  Whatever.  My girls, sir, they didn't care for the overlook at first.  One of them actually stole a pack of matches and tried to burn it down.  But I corrected them, sir.  And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty, I corrected her. 
[03:19:00]  Ah, that's great.  Corrected.  Chopped into pieces with a hatchet.  The greatest part is he goes, um, right here he goes, uh, if you don't mind my saying so.  It's like what he's basically is teaching him that you have to murder your family with an axe.  And he's just keeping all politeness.  Yeah, if, you know, you don't mind me saying.  I'm not trying to be out of line, but, you know, I think an axe to both of them is the answer. 
[03:19:30]  So there you go.  That's a brilliant scene from The Shining.  Cook.  Cook.  And now we're going to reenact.  The way he says cook.  Oh, dude, he's the greatest.  Now we're going to reenact it with Pat Pumanaki and the big A, Andrew.  Yes, Pat?  It seems as though I have all the one-word answers.  I know.  We're going to have to bring it back for another script.  I noticed that, too.  Yeah.  Just play along as Jack, though.  Okay.  All right?  It's not important how many words you have.  There's only an hour left in the show.  It's how you say them.  You know something?  About a month, two months ago, you'd have had all the lines, Pat. 
[03:20:00]  That's right.  That's right.  See what happens now?  Now you're just jackass playing jackporns.  All right.  So here we go.  Let's all be quiet and listen to Andrew and Pat Pumanaki.  Do we have the music?  Maybe we could play it really low in the background.  A little shining music.  I know it's not the actual little big band music that was going on.  The fish and goose soiree music.  Right.  Fish and goose soiree.  All right.  You got it?  All right.  You're very low in the background.  That's foul.  All right.  Here we go.  Very low. 
[03:20:30]  Go ahead.  Did you know, Mr. Torrance, that your son is attempting to bring an outside party into  this situation?  Did you know that?  No.  He is, Mr. Torrance. 
[03:21:00]  Ooh.  A nigger.  A nigger?  A nigger cook.  How?  Your son has a very great talent.  I don't think you are aware of how great it is.  That he is attempting to use that he is attempting to use that very talent against your will. 
[03:21:30]  He is a very willful boy.  I think he is, Mr. Torrance, a very willful boy.  A rather naughty boy.  If I may be so bold, sir. 
[03:22:00]  It's his mother.  She, uh, interferes.  Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind me saying so.  Perhaps a bit more.  My girls, sir, they didn't care for the Overlook at first.  One of them actually took a pack of matches and tried to burn it down. 
[03:22:30]  He changed the word.  You can see, you can't do the S-T.  No.  Back up.  Start with one of them.  Do it right.  Listen to this.  Go ahead, Andrew.  I can't deal with this. 
[03:23:00]  A pack of matches and tried to burn it down.  But I corrected them, sir.  And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty, I corrected her.  Wow.  Bravo.  Fantastic.  I didn't even catch why he changed to sold a token to use of that. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  It's that whole S-T thing that Anthony pointed out.  Oh, my God.  What I was laughing at is the only thing he didn't stutter on was a nigger and a nigger cook.  It's all those years of driving in the Bronx.  Bravo.  Oh, the big A and Pat from Menachie.  And Pat's Christian Slater impression was dead on.  It really was.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Getting through stole.  That's the highlight, right?  She.  By the way, judging by some of this, not to overuse Andrew, but boy, Bella's dialogue would be perfect. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I saw that, too.  Which one?  Bella's dialogue.  Bella.  Oh, Ed Wood?  Ed Wood.  All right.  Why don't we, yeah, we'll bring him back for that.  We have Jaws, Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction.  I'm thinking we go to Goodfellas and team up Paul and Frenchie.  Goodfellas.  I've got to find my script for Goodfellas.  What do you think?  There it is. 
[03:24:30]  What do you think, Anthony?  Who do you need?  Frenchie?  Oh, yeah.  That could be cool.  Frenchie and Paul?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's bring in Frenchie and Paul.  Who plays what part?  Who plays Pesci, you think?  We need a couple of people for this scene.  Oh, wow.  We need a lot, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, all right, all right.  Oh, wow.  How many people are in this scene?  We've got Tommy, Henry, Vito, and Spider.  So four?  Tommy should be, I'm thinking Frenchie. 
[03:25:00]  Hendry, Vito.  No, I think Paul should be Pesci.  Yeah, let's get Paul as Pesci.  Okay.  Who's Spider?  Spider's got to be Andrew, right?  Let's read this real quick and see.  Yeah, right?  Where's the ST for?  Where are the ST words?  No, I don't see many.  It's Spider should be Andrew. 
[03:25:30]  All right, let's do Spider's Andrew.  Get Andrew back in here.  All right, everyone knows their role.  So, so far we've got Paul as Pesci.  Andrew's Spider.  Now, who's going to be Ray Liotta's character?  Frenchie?  All right, Frenchie is Ray Liotta's character.  And then Vito, who has only a couple of lines in this, right?  Yeah.  So Vito will just be, who's left out there, guy-wise?  Who's out there?  You've got Patty, you've got...  I said guy-wise. 
[03:26:00]  You've got Sandy Kane.  You've got Sandy Kane.  Pat.  Pat.  It's Pat.  We need a guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, you guys got to share mics.  All right, we'll do the scene as they are setting up Anthony, okay?  Give out everyone's script there.  This is the famous scene from Goodfellas.  Now, make sure you get everything.  Get the inflection.  Listen up.  Listen up, people.  Do some acting.  Hey, Spider.  I'm your way over here.  Bring me a cutting water. 
[03:26:30]  I'm hungry.  Did you guys eat?  I'll stop.  I don't want some change.  Here you go.  I thought you guys came over.  I'll play these.  What?  Play those?  What?  I'm fucking starting up with.  Okay, you get a drink.  All right.  What am I, Amorati?  What?  What?  Where's my fucking drink?  I asked you for a drink.  You wanted a drink.  I just asked you for a fucking drink.  No, I thought you said that you were all right, Spider.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What do you got me on?  A fucking pain-on-mind list, kid?  No, I heard... 
[03:27:00]  I thought I heard someone say something.  Spider, Spider.  Spider, Spider.  You know you're a fucking mumbling, stuttering little fuck.  You know that?  I thought you said I was all right, Spider.  No, you ain't all right, Spider.  You got a lot of fucking problems.  No, I thought you said you were all right, Spider.  I am all right.  You ain't all right, you little fucking prick.  I thought I am...  You've been doing this all fucking night.  Give me your motherfucker.  Want a drink now?  I'll bring it for you.  Yeah, well, give me a fucking drink.  Move it, you little prick.  You walk like fucking stepping past your pants. 
[03:27:30]  Everybody else, you'll fucking run.  Run for me, you prick.  Dance.  Dance the fucking drink back here.  Hello, prick.  Hey, what's that movie that woke on me?  Which one?  The one where you play the cowboy.  The only the one.  The Oklahoma Kid.  Shane?  Oklahoma Kid.  Shane.  Oklahoma Kid.  That's me.  I'm the Oklahoma Kid.  You're a fucking partner.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Yahoo, you motherfucker.  Come on.  Now he's moving.  He's making me believe in me. 
[03:28:00]  Henry, what?  He's got him in my foot.  Tommy?  He's fucking...  All right, so he got shot in the foot.  What is it?  A big fucking deal?  Vito, Vito, get a towel.  Nice fucking game.  All right.  Nice fucking game.  Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.  Come on.  Look.  Let him crawl there like he crawls for the fucking drink.  Take him down the doctor.  Take him to the doctor down the street.  Fucking brick.  He's like his bones all shiny.  Come on, man.  Don't get me upset now.  Come on.  Don't make a big fucking thing out of it, Spidey.  You little prick.  You're trying to make me think what the fuck I did here. 
[03:28:30]  It's an accident.  Fuck it.  And there you have it.  What?  Who did the transcribing?  Who transcribed this?  Yeah, he missed a few, right?  He got the spider line completely wrong.  He missed a lot of the lines and he's...  What the fuck's he doing?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Who transcribed it?  Where is he?  Mike's off today.  Yeah, Mike stinks.  Spider, his line?  He's a bozo Shannon?  What the fuck is that?  How about...  He's a bozo Shannon?  That's a TV edit. 
[03:29:00]  Makes no sense.  What is the line again?  The bones are all shattered.  Right.  He's like talking about his foot being shot up.  Right, right.  He says the bones are all shattered.  He got lazy at the end.  And he goes, eh, you made me think what I do here.  You made me think what the fuck I did here.  Oh.  All right, well, why don't we...  A little non-transcribing shit dick.  All right.  You guys are obviously going to have to share mics.  Well, yeah, okay, we got the boys holding the mic on. 
[03:29:30]  We played Jimmy, by the way.  No, we didn't cast Jimmy.  Ann or somebody would just throw that line in.  I want to be Jimmy.  All right, you be Jimmy.  You be Jimmy.  Because you are Jimmy, so that would be really nice.  All right, here we go.  I will take care of sound effects, by the way.  You will?  I'm on sound effects.  Oh!  This is like old-time radio.  Yeah.  All right.  Are you guys ready?  Ready as we'll ever be.  All right, so once again, who's playing what?  Paul, you're playing?  You're playing Tommy.  400 lines. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, and Henry's going to be Pat from Anaki.  Right?  I'm Vito.  Oh, Vito?  Who's Henry again?  Me.  Oh, Frenchy.  And then Andrew is Spider.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Paul, go ahead.  Hey, Spider, on your way over here, bring me a cutting water, huh?  Did you guys eat?  I'm starving.  I want some Chinese.  I'll play these.  You play those?  What, did I fucking stutter?  I'll play these.  What am I, a Mirage?  What?  Where's my fucking drink? 
[03:30:30]  I asked you for a drink.  You wanted a drink?  I just asked you for a fucking drink.  No, I thought, I thought you said you're right, Spider.  No, no, no.  What, you got me on a fucking pain on my list, kid?  No, cause I, I thought I heard someone say something.  Spider, Spider, I thought it was Henry.  Spider, Spider, you know you're a fucking mumbling, stuttering little fuck, you know that? 
[03:31:00]  No, I thought you said I was all right, Spider.  No, you ain't all right, Spider.  You got a lot of fucking problems.  No, I thought you said you were all right, Spider.  That's too good.  I am all right.  You ain't all right, you little fucking prick.  That's what?  I, I, I thought that, but you said. 
[03:31:30]  Aida, Aida, you've been doing this all night to me, you motherfucker.  Once us, a drink, now, I'll bring it for you.  Yeah, go get me a drink.  Move it, you little prick.  You want to fucking step and fetch us?  Everyone else, you fucking run.  Run for me, you little prick.  Dance.  Dance the fucking drink back here.  Hello, prick.  Hey, what's that movie Boy Got Made?  Which one?  The one where he played a cowboy.  He only did one.  Oh, the Oklahoma Kid.  Oklahoma Kid, that's me.  I'm the Oklahoma Kid.  Dance, dance. 
[03:32:00]  Yahoo, motherfucker.  Come on, dance.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Dance, you prick.  Now he's moving.  Henry, what happened?  He got shot in the foot, Tommy.  So he got shot in the foot.  What is it, a big fucking deal?  Vito, Vito, get it down.  Nice fucking game.  Nice fucking game.  Yeah, take him to Ben Casey, you little prick.  Walk.  Let him crawl.  They're like he crawls for the fucking drink.  Don't make me upset now.  The bones are all shattered.  Don't make a big fang out of it, spider. 
[03:32:30]  You little prick.  You're going to make me think.  What'd I do here?  It was an accident.  Great job by Andrew, paying attention.  Both of those bones are shattered.  Yeah, very nice.  How about this next time we just get scripts and actually read off the scripts?  Yes.  That's a good idea because the transcription stinks.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Which one did he get wrong in here, too?  Oh, he did something here that made me just want to fucking smash his fingers.  Hey, do we have any scripts with women?  Why don't we bring the women in? 
[03:33:00]  Oh, right.  We have Pulp Fiction.  We have Jaws.  We didn't think of that.  We have Reservoir Dogs.  Who didn't think of that?  Back to schools.  Nah, we want more popular scenes, I think, right?  We could use them for Reservoir Dogs.  King of Comedy has two females.  King of Comedy?  I'd rather hear, like, the Jaws or Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, right?  Yeah.  The ladies might be out.  We'll have to redo it, the ladies.  Which one do you want to go to next, Sam?  Pulp Fiction. 
[03:33:30]  Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies.  Reservoir Dogs or Jaws, Hooper and Brody talking.  That's pretty good, too.  Yeah, that's another good one.  What movie's this?  Say what again?  Oh.  So, you know.  All right, Jaws.  Want to go Jaws?  Yeah.  What was that?  Holy shit.  Can we use a girl on a man's part?  No.  You have to hook her.  I like the authenticity.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Well, I think we know who's going to be Quint.  Who?  Andrew?  Of course.  Okay, Andrew, you're Quint.  Ah, look at the huge dialogue, the huge chunk he's got.  That's going to be great.  This will probably end a bit, the Jaws scene.  Then we got, who wants to be Hooper?  Hooper.  We've got to give Pat some lines for once.  Yeah.  All right, Pat, you'll be Hooper.  You'll be Hooper.  Who wants to be Brody?  Chief.  Who wants to be Brody? 
[03:34:30]  Frenchy.  Frenchy is Brody.  Yeah.  And Mayor Vaughn.  Mayor Vaughn.  And who else?  Martin?  Martin.  How about Paul can be the mayor?  Oh, we're doing two.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Oh, there's two scenes from the movie.  Oh, all right.  It's a lot easier.  Which scene you want, Anthony?  I'm sorry.  Ah, well, scene two is great because it has,  Quint's whole dialogue about the sub.  But scene one is fun because it's got Mayor Vaughn talking about the Kittner kid. 
[03:35:00]  I think we've got to go with Quint, though.  How about we do both scenes?  We end with the Jaws thing here.  We'll have time.  Yeah, let's end with the Jaws thing.  We'll start with scene two?  We'll start with, uh...  No, we'll have time.  Start with scene one.  Because then that'll be the grand finale when he has to do the whole Quint speech.  Okay, so who's Hooper?  Yeah, now we just need Hooper and Brody and Mayor Vaughn.  Who would be the best mayor, you think?  Uh, Mayor Vaughn in this scene would have to be, uh, Big A.  Big A?  Yeah.  All right, Big A is the star of this bit today. 
[03:35:30]  All right, uh, Big A, you're going to be the mayor.  All right, then we got Hooper.  Who's Hooper?  Hooper is, uh...  Pat, we need more lines for Pat, right?  Pat from Monaki.  All right, Pat from Monaki.  And then Frenchie, maybe?  Yeah.  Frenchie is Brody?  Yeah.  All right, here's the original scene.  Martin, there are all kinds of sharks in the waters, you know?  Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.  And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark...  Oh, now there's no other sharks like this in these waters.  Martin, Martin, it's a hundred to one.  A hundred to one. 
[03:36:00]  Now, I'm not saying that this is not the shark.  It probably is, Martin.  It probably is.  It's a man-eater.  It's extremely rare for these waters.  But the fact is that the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim.  I just, I want to be sure.  You want to be sure.  We all want to be sure, okay?  And what I want to do is very simple.  The digestive system of this animal is very, very slow.  Let's cut it open.  Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be in there, and then we'll be sure. 
[03:36:30]  Maybe the only way to confirm us, huh?  Fellas, let's be reasonable, huh?  This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.  And I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock.  And there you have it.  May I say?  A very famous scene from Jaws.  Yes, sir.  First of all, dummy called it Kintner boy. 
[03:37:00]  Isn't it Kintner boy?  Yeah.  And he also spells pro-form, pro-form, not per-form.  And then eaten, he fucking puts an apostrophe after it like it's a slang.  Fucking dope.  Yeah, we'll have to make fun of him.  What did he fucking write this with his fat toes?  All right.  Well, we're running out of time, so we'll have to make do here.  You guys ready to know what parts you're playing?  Let's start with Hooper, which is Pat from Menachie.  Here we go. 
[03:37:30]  Martin, there are all kinds of sharks in the waters, you know?  Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos, and the chances that these bozos got the exact shark.  Oh, no, there's no shark like this in the water.  Martin, Martin, it's 100 to 1.  100 to 1.  Now, I'm not saying that this is not the shark.  It probably is.  Martin, well, I skipped the line.  For these waters, but the fact is that the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim. 
[03:38:00]  I just, I want to be sure.  You want to be sure.  We all want to be sure, okay?  Now, what I want to do is very simple.  The digestive system of this animal is very, very slow.  Let's cut it open.  Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be in there, and then we'll be sure.  Maybe the only way to confirm it, huh?  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable, huh? 
[03:38:30]  This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish.  I'm not going to stand here and see that thing cut open and see that little kitten-a-boy spill out all over the dot. 
[03:39:00]  Wow.  You actually hold your breath.  I know.  You end up holding your breath.  Yeah, you hold your breath with him.  Oh, wow.  Bravo.  And, Frenchy, no laughing during other people's dialogue, goddammit.  Yeah.  No, let your cackle him.  We're trying to hear Big A do his lines.  Now, the next scene, we can't play the whole thing in the original form because we're running out of show.  No, it's long.  Just to give you a little taste, another scene from Jaws, this one.  What's that one?  What? 
[03:39:30]  That one there on your arm.  Oh, well, it's a tattoo.  I got that removed.  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  Mother.  What is that?  Tohupa, that's the USS Indianapolis. 
[03:40:00]  You want the Indianapolis?  What happened?  Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.  Chief.  He was coming back from the island of Tinian Delady and just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima bomb.  All right.  And then, obviously, the very famous Quint.  God, is that great.  Yeah.  Monologue, basically, right?  Yeah.  And they're on the boat getting drunk, looking at their scars and their tattoos. 
[03:40:30]  Everyone remembers the scene.  Oh, my God.  This is going to take forever.  I know.  That's why we've got to get right into it.  We've got to get right into it.  So, who's playing Martin in this scene?  I am.  All right.  So, Frenchy's Martin.  Quint is obviously Andrew.  Yes.  It's all about Andrew today.  Hooper.  Paul can be Hooper.  He hasn't had many lines.  Yeah, let's get Paul as Hooper.  Sorry.  All right.  Sorry, Pat.  And there you have it.  So, let's get this draw scene going here.  What's that one? 
[03:41:00]  Wait, what?  By the way, Frenchy is the worst.  The worst.  The pause in between.  He's cackling.  He put the apostrophe of the commas in the wrong place.  In the last scene, he was supposed to interrupt, and there was like a three-second pause, and  then he...  Yeah, there's no interruption.  It was awful.  He's dumb.  All right, let's start over.  What's that one?  What?  Wait, he needs a mic.  Nathaniel.  Hold on.  Now we've got to start over again.  You guys have got to work the mics better.  All right, one more time.  Here we go.  Running out of show.  Let's go.  Frenchy. 
[03:41:30]  What's that one?  What?  No one there on your arm.  Well, it's a...  It's a...  I just...  I got...  I removed.  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  Mother.  What is it?  Hold on.  Did you listen to the clip?  Yeah, there's a big laugh.  But there's a big laugh there.  That's why it says laugh in perimsy.  Mother.  Mother.  Mother.  All right, back up one line.  Back to Quint.  Don't tell me.  Mum. 
[03:42:00]  Back to Quint.  Mum.  Mr. Hooper.  That's the USS Indianapolis.  That's fine.  Go ahead.  You were only in Indianapolis?  What happened?  Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, chief.  It was coming back on the island of Tinian, the lady.  He just delivered the bomb.  The Hiroshima bomb. 
[03:42:30]  The 1,100 men went into the water.  The vessel went down in 12 minutes.  He didn't see the first shark for about half an hour, tiger.  Thirteen-footer.  Thirteen-footer.  Thirteen-footer.  Thirteen-footer.  You know?  You know that when you're in the water, chief?  You tell by looking from the dorsal to the tail. 
[03:43:00]  Well, we didn't know.  Because our bomb mission had been so secret.  No distress signal had been sent.  Huh?  Huh?  They didn't even list us overdue for a week.  Very light, chief.  The sharks came cruising.  So we formed ourselves into tight groups.  You know, it's kind of like old swears. 
[03:43:30]  A battle, like a, see a calendar.  Like the Battle of Waterloo.  And the idea was the shark,  the nearest man,  and then he started pounding.  And hollering and screaming.  And sometimes the shark would go away.  Sometimes he wouldn't go away.  Sometimes that shark, 
[03:44:00]  he looks right into you.  Right into your eyes.  You know?  The thing about a shark,  he's got lifeless eyes.  Black eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  This concludes our podcast day.  You'll be an Anthony show.  And then,  you... 
[03:44:30]  You already have anything on you.  You know?  You're two.  You're two.  You're two.  I'll be an Anthony show.  That was cool.  I'll be super bright.  You're one.  You're another.  You're one.  You're two.  That's awesome.  I'm an American football football team.  You're in the now.  You're two.  You're three.  Yeah.  I'm an American football team.  You're two.  You're in the now.  I'm a freak out.  I'm not out.  Wooüzik a baby. </pre>
