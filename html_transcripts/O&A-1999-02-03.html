<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie suffering a headache, possibly stemming from the previous night's contentious discussions involving "monkey meat" and "retard sex."  The hosts then reviewed the previous night's episode of the Guinness Book of World Records, deriding its focus on bizarre, "freak show" entries like a man with an external heart and a man bathing with rattlesnakes, rather than genuine achievements.  The show transitioned into listener feedback, largely centered on the "retard sex" discussion.  Listeners offered various interpretations, and one recounted seeing two developmentally disabled individuals kissing on a bus.  Debate ensued about the appropriateness of the discussion and whether the hosts were being paid to promote a film depicting similar content.  A caller shared a story about a listener, Brian, witnessing what appeared to be a couple having sex in a moving car, leading to the replay of a previous day's audio clip of a sexual act on Route 78; the authenticity of the call was debated.

Further listener feedback addressed previous segments, including the "Hummer Club" and failed attempts to watch the Victoria's Secret fashion show online.  One caller's story about their spouse's video game addiction sparked a discussion on relationship dynamics. Another caller shared a negative experience with a modeling agency.  A woman named Tara then visited the studio.  She discussed her unsuccessful modeling attempts, mentioning a relative who was president of Playboy. Opie and Anthony offered to photograph her for their website.

The hosts photographed Tara in various states of undress, intending to post the pictures on their website to gauge listener reaction regarding her suitability for Playboy. This caused a massive website traffic surge, reportedly impacting internet access in the Northeast.  The hosts jokingly blamed Tara for the outage.  The chaos was further amplified by an unexpected interruption from a Charlton Heston impersonator who claimed responsibility for impregnating a vasectomized chimpanzee at the Los Angeles Zoo, providing graphic details of the act.  The photos were eventually uploaded, sparking a flood of listener calls, with opinions varying on Tara’s appearance and the show’s antics.  The hosts mentioned sponsors including Priceline.com and upcoming events like a Stephen Lynch performance.  The segment was filled with crude humor, sexual innuendo, and homophobic slurs.

The following segment focused on listener responses to Tara's online photos.  Callers offered both positive and negative critiques of her appearance, with some describing her as having a "plastic look." Tara herself responded, expressing gratitude for positive comments and remaining unfazed by negative ones. The hosts highlighted their listeners' brutally honest feedback and joked about their "dysfunctional family" relationship with their audience.  Numerous calls followed, with listeners criticizing Tara's appearance, speculating about her marital status (due to a wedding ring), and inquiring about the identity of the next DJ for the show.  The hosts, anticipating negative reactions, stated they were forbidden from revealing the DJ's name.  The segment concluded with the hosts offering Tara career advice and thanking her for her appearance. The overall tone remained informal, irreverent, and often sexually suggestive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Child, Slight Return.  Collective Soul, their latest run from their Dosage CD.  And we're world premiering that album tonight at 11 o'clock right here on NEW  if you want to hear what the rest of Collective Soul's latest is all about.  Bundabah.  What's up? It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello there.  For your ride home.  How are we today?  I feel like crap.  What's your problem? 
[00:00:30]  I don't know. I've got a nasty headache.  Oh, that's how it starts.  What do you mean?  The flu thing.  No, don't say that.  I've avoided the flu, but I'm getting everything else.  I think it's a stress headache.  What are you stressing about?  This place, hello?  But it is getting better.  Good.  It really is starting to get a lot better around here,  so I don't know why I'm still getting these stress headaches,  but it might be because you made me laugh so hard last night.  Well, that's a good thing.  That monkey meat stuff and the retard sex. 
[00:01:00]  I thought some hell about that one.  I think that's what it is.  I don't think it's stress headaches.  I think it's you making me laugh so hard that I'm having blood vessels in my brain.  Well, good.  Your misery will be everybody else's pleasure.  But I'm going to be fine because I popped six aspirin.  Did you?  Yeah.  You've got to take real aspirin, man.  I can't take that Tylenol, ibuprofen, Advil, crapple.  It's got to be extra strength Excedrin. 
[00:01:30]  Well, that's what you gave me, and so far it's not working.  Come on.  So I popped some Tylenols.  Come on.  What?  I'm telling you the truth.  This stuff never works.  I'm not going to sit here and fake it.  I'm going to take the real deal.  Hey, I've got to bring up something really fast.  Did you see the Guinness Book of World Records last night?  Damn, no.  I tell you about it every week.  You've got to check it out.  I'm usually, you know what it is?  We get home relatively late from here, and I eat dinner at that time.  And I cannot watch that Guinness Book of World Records show while I'm eating dinner. 
[00:02:00]  It's disgusting.  That's the best time to watch it.  Oh, please.  It just goes with the whole thing.  I'm eating spaghetti, and they're talking about the record for eating worms or something.  And I can't deal with that.  Well, we saw the snap-on face guy in the past.  We thought that was pretty gross, right?  Yeah, big guy.  The guy had a divot taken out of his head.  He had, yeah, the whole front of his face is snap-on where you could fit a softball right  through the middle of his face, and he had snap-on ears and stuff.  You thought that was gross.  Yes.  You thought the lady with the 300-pound tumor that they operated on was gross. 
[00:02:30]  Where they just got the heebie-jeebies.  Where they took the tumor away in a wheelbarrow after they removed it from her.  And it had hair and teeth growing in it.  Yes.  Well, last night they outdid themselves.  They found a guy who is living with his heart beating outside his body.  Stop it.  And for some reason, this is Guinness Book of World.  Yeah, what kind of record is that?  They perverted that show into something, a freak show. 
[00:03:00]  They have made a new record, the guy living with a heart outside his body for the longest  time.  That's ridiculous.  It's the Guinness freak show.  That's exactly what it is.  When are we going to have pickled punks?  Yeah, they should fess up and just call it the Guinness Book freak show.  Of course.  Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.  See the pickled punks.  You know that's coming next.  But they had some great footage of this guy.  He was born with his heart outside his body.  They showed the pictures.  There's his heart with like a slight covering over it. 
[00:03:30]  Outside his body.  And what they said was when the mother gave birth, they just kind of put it in the corner  of the hospital room just assuming it's going to die in a couple hours.  Well, the damn thing continues to live.  So they're like, wow, we better operate and try to do something.  Then they couldn't get it back in his body because his chest cavity was too small.  Get out of here.  So they decided the safest bet was to just leave it outside his body.  So they kind of just put it under the skin, though, because it wasn't even under the skin. 
[00:04:00]  Dog fish.  So now the kid, he lives in Philadelphia, and he's the mayor of South Philly.  That's what he's called.  The mayor of South Philly.  And he's now 23 years old, and he's still living.  Dude, and of course, Guinness Book of World Records, they had to go the distance, so they're  talking about the story and showing the old footage and stuff.  Now they've got a picture of him as a 23-year-old kid in his apartment, on the phone, talking  to his bud with his shirt off.  No.  With the heart just, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Come on, you saw his heart? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah, just bouncing right in front.  Well, you didn't see the actual heart, but you see the skin just drastically moving forward.  Oh, my God.  So the way he lives, because obviously you can't go around like that.  Someone elbows you, you're going to have, you know.  Yeah, you'd be dead.  So they got this special, like, breastplate he has to wear constantly.  Like D-Lo Brown from the WWF.  He has to wear a chestplate.  That's exactly what it is.  The same type of thing.  And they show him playing basketball and stuff.  Come on.  It was just out there, man.  That's not a record. 
[00:05:00]  That's a freak show.  Yeah, and then they got, you know, they have the graphics come down, and it's like, you  know, a person living with a heart outside his body for the longest time.  Stupid record.  A new record.  Stupid.  What a great show, though.  Oh, I can't watch it.  And then they had the snake guy last night.  He set the record.  He lies in a bathtub.  Yeah.  And they had 37 or 30-something rattlesnakes.  Rattlesnakes?  In there with him.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, interesting.  And the guy had no hair, so they made, like, a rattlesnake hairpiece for him. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  It was one of the rattlesnakes.  And that set some type of record.  And that set a record.  Yeah.  I thought most people weren't doing dangerous records anymore.  That's what they said, right?  Yeah, they don't do the Buried Alive record.  They don't recognize that.  And they don't do the Hold Your Breath Underwater record anymore.  Mm-hmm.  Because they're dangerous, but a bathtub full of rattlesnakes is fine.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  And it's been in the media in the past few years that the Guinness Book of World Records  have become PC.  Yeah.  Like, if you get the latest edition of the book, you don't really get to see a lot of 
[00:06:00]  the freaks anymore.  Yeah.  You don't get to see the fat twins on the bike anymore.  Or, you know.  The midgets and the...  The fidgets are good.  The fidgets and the real fat people and stuff.  I like tongue and whang.  Some of these twins, ging and pang.  Ging and pang.  Hawk and pork.  Yeah, those guys connect them out of chess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were the sickest people to ever live on this earth.  Yeah.  Because they ended up getting married to separate women and having, like, 20 kids between them. 
[00:06:30]  What the hell did that bedroom look like?  I don't know how you do that.  I don't know either.  So, there you go.  I thought I'd share.  Guinness Book of World Records freak show on every, what, Tuesday night?  I shan't be watching.  Why?  I gotta eat.  And tape it for later.  The guy with the heart outside the body.  That's right down your alley, Anthony.  No.  No, it isn't.  I don't like disgusting stuff.  You don't like to see stuff like that.  No, that's why people are always sending me that website.  Rotten.com.  Rotten.com.  They go, Anthony, you gotta check this out. 
[00:07:00]  What makes people think I want to see people impaled on poles and with their heads chopped off  and after traffic accidents splattered on the road?  Well, they listen to our radio show and they assume it's right down your alley.  That's all.  No, no.  Sex is great.  I will tune into that on the internet at the drop of a hat if you got a link to that.  But the gross stuff, that does nothing for me.  It disturbs me.  See, that's weird.  It doesn't disturb me.  No, I can't do that.  It gives me nightmares.  I enjoy checking it out.  Some guy emailed me a picture and it was titled like Hot Babe. 
[00:07:30]  And I click on it and it starts to download.  And I see the top of her head and it's like, oh, cool.  This is going to be good.  It keeps going down, down until it gets to her mouth.  It turned out some kind of horrible accident where a piece of metal hit her right in the  mouth and cut her jaw off.  And I'm looking at this like, gee, thanks.  Why would I want to see this?  It's disturbing.  You guys, send out some good jigs.  No, come on.  Don't.  Or JPEGs.  I swear, I'm dumping every photo I get without even opening them. 
[00:08:00]  No way.  Send the JPEGs and the chips.  I'm not going to be able to open anything.  I'll send them, I'll forward them right to Opie.  It's fine.  I'll check them out.  Go check them out, you sick.  I had, don't, I'm pretty desensitized at this point.  Well, that's, that's really healthy.  That's a great healthy attitude to have.  Well, the only, the only thing in recent years that really got to me was when we talked  to that lady that cleaned, cleaned up the, the crime scenes.  That really got to me.  That, see, that didn't bother me. 
[00:08:30]  Why?  Because she was just talking about it.  When I look at pictures of real people mangled.  Yeah, but she was describing, you know, some of the scenes she's, she's cleaned up in the  past.  Who cares?  That's like a movie.  Oh, no way.  You know, but when you see pictures of real people just hacked apart, that just, it disturbs  me.  All right.  Very nice.  Send them to Opie, not to Anthony.  Thank you.  Also, real fast, want to thank Clinton for visiting our fine city yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, in the paper, he says he owes New York a huge debt. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  He loves it.  He has an inexpressible gratitude to New Yorkers.  So he expresses that by just clogging traffic up.  Yeah.  Last night, while everybody's trying to get home, they closed the Grand Central, they  closed the LIE, bridges, you never know where he's going to be, they closed roads.  It was a nightmare last night.  Yeah, horrible, horrible getting out of town.  He clogged traffic like he clogged Monica.  Last night.  Jesus. 
[00:09:30]  What?  Well.  Okay.  I guess so.  Come on.  Nightmare.  Make that analogy short.  Yeah, you're right.  That's a little rough, but.  We can work on that, I guess.  All right.  All right.  On the way, we got another track from the Black Crows, By Your Side CD.  Great song from the Doors.  And we're all set and ready to go here, gang.  Fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  Phone line is ready to go, and we got the instant feedback.  Just go to the WNEW website.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York. 
[00:10:00]  Pearl Jam live this time around from Live on Two Legs.  That's daughter.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  We're hanging.  And got a great instant feedback here from Brian from Midtown.  You know what's funny about this show?  We'll hit on some stuff, and then you go home, and you watch the news.  Yeah.  And you just die laughing.  We're already getting a bunch of people calling that.  They couldn't watch the story about the groundhog that died in Canada because we goofed on that yesterday.  So when the story came on the news last night as a serious story, people lost it. 
[00:10:30]  Did you see the picture on the paper?  Yeah.  He's in his little cute coffin.  Yeah.  They put the groundhog in a coffin, and he's got his little groundhog hands all perched up on his chest.  He's just laying there with a big buck groundhog teeth.  He's laying in a pine coffin.  And the people are around him all morning and everything and feeling bad.  And I almost spit up my dinner last night.  I'm watching the news, and they had the monkey meat story. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that one last night, too.  No, it's supposed to be a serious story about how AIDS started from people eating monkey meat.  Monkey meat.  But after the whole Charlton Heston last few days, I can't watch the story.  It's just too funny.  Too freaking funny.  And with that in mind, Brian from Midtown writes, Anthony and Opie, yesterday the subject was retard sex in your show.  Well, this is no joke, but there are retarded people that get on my bus in Queens every day.  This morning, two of them were making out on the back of the bus. 
[00:11:30]  I swear to God.  It was like a car crash when you really, really, really don't want to look, but you're compelled to look for some reason.  The worst part was that right as they stopped and were about to get off the bus, the guy said to the girl, your mouth tastes funny.  I accidentally busted out laughing because all I could think of was Anthony and Corky Steinbrenner's voice saying,  and it tastes like a corn dog.  So now there is a busload of people who know that I'll be in hell. 
[00:12:00]  Anyway, this is all true, so help me God, Brian in Midtown.  God, that's funny.  It tastes like a corn dog.  Just do the your mouth tastes funny, please.  Your mouth tastes funny.  Ah.  Man, I was just catching hell yesterday.  Emails and letters.  How could you use the word retard and retard sex?  I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  That movie clip for The Other Sister?  Mm-hmm.  That movie that's coming out with Julia Lewis where she plays the retard?  Right.  And she hooks up with a guy, retard, and, you know, it's retard sex.  They're going through the pages of the joy of sex.  And I don't know.  I find that a little standoffish.  And someone sent us a fax and said, are you guys getting money for promoting that new movie?  Yeah, like the only reason anyone's going to see it now is because they want to, like, goof on Julia Lewis.  And this guy having sex.  Well, we're in our right minds going to see that trailer and not think about retard sex. 
[00:13:00]  Retard sex.  Which, by the way, we don't have officially a definition for.  No.  It's just.  We asked you guys yesterday, what is the definition of retard sex?  It doesn't necessarily have to do with disabled people.  And so far, we don't have the official definition for retard sex.  So that's how you can play along at home today, if you like.  You can send a fax or an instant feedback on that.  Annie from North Arlington writes, the definition of retard sex, having sex with my husband. 
[00:13:30]  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, the boss from tracks with seven angels.  It's Opie and Anthony just getting warmed up here, but the show is coming together quite nicely.  Oh, gosh.  Keep the email and the faxes and the phone calls are coming.  We love your participation on the show.  Todd from Jersey writes, Oppenack, can you please replay the girl giving a road hummer from yesterday's show? 
[00:14:00]  You guys rule.  Keep rocking.  I mean, I think that bit might have made it into the never to be played again category.  The forbidden file.  The forbidden file.  Yes.  You know what we should do?  We should make a website with all our forbidden bits that you only get to hear once.  And then we get in big trouble for.  Yes.  And we can't play them again, put them on the website.  Oh, I like that.  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Maybe someone could start that that bootlegs our show.  Because I think if it came from us, we'd get in trouble for that as well.  So, well, there's a little controversy about that bit yesterday. 
[00:14:30]  I think the people upstairs in management are a little uneasy about that bit yesterday, Anthony.  Why is that?  Well, I don't know.  We had a lovely couple in the car yesterday on the ride home on Route 78.  It's a Tuesday night, Hummer Club.  And, yeah, they thought it was a perfect opportunity to join the club.  Right.  And we can't confirm that the lady was actually getting the deed done. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Sounded like her mouth was full, but who are we to judge?  Exactly.  I thought it was harmless.  It was some fun radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  I could hear the guy's voice, too.  It started getting very breathy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, I can't go.  I can't go.  Sure.  And then he said he was swerving all over the road.  I wonder if that couple made it home safely.  If they're listening, I think they need to give us a call today.  Yeah, let them know. 
[00:15:30]  Let us know how they did.  Yeah.  But I'm not sure if that bit has officially made the forbidden file yet.  We might be able to sneak one more play out of it before we have to trash it.  You think so?  I don't know.  It could go either way.  No one has told us officially that we're not allowed to play.  Right.  I mean, if I just, like, happen to push play here.  And it played?  Yeah.  I mean, I can do that.  You can?  I think I could do that, eh?  Because now I'm thinking we better get this on the air before they tell us not to play it again. 
[00:16:00]  True.  Because now that we brought it up on the radio, I'm sure they're running from downstairs to tell us no.  Right.  So you want to play it one more time?  Yeah, let's hear if it's, listen at home, too.  If you think it's the actual article.  If it's really happening.  Yeah.  Yeah, give us your feedback on this, if this offends you, or if this is the type of thing you like to hear on the radio from time to time.  We'll preface it like that.  I just want to know if it's real or not.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, let's take a listen. 
[00:16:30]  N.E.W., what's up?  Hey, I wanted to know if I can get on the air, because if I did, I told my husband I'd give him a Hummer for Hummer Tuesday.  We're driving home from work.  You're on the air.  I'm on the air?  Yes.  Well, then, I guess I got to go to work.  Now, what road are you guys on?  Route 78.  No kidding.  Now, who's driving?  He is.  Uh-oh.  That's dangerous.  If you're on Route 78, watch out, guys.  Yes, sir.  Thanks, guys.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Give him the phone.  Hold on.  We'll see how far we can go with this. 
[00:17:00]  Which one of the wackos do I have?  Both of us.  I love you guys.  Thanks.  I'm a big fan of you guys.  Are you officially a member of the club, or are you going to become a member?  I'm going to be real soon.  Yeah?  Is that she's going to do it on the road?  She slurs.  I said, every Tuesday, I come home.  I'm like, it's Hummer Tuesday.  Hummer Tuesday.  And I've been beating on her, so we're commuting home tonight.  I'm like, you owe me one.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  Well, what do you say you at least get things started right now? 
[00:17:30]  That works for me.  All right.  Let her rip.  Got to get started, honey.  All right.  Just describe what she's doing carefully.  Right now, I'm zipping my drawers.  All right.  And how fast are you going?  Right now, I'm all over the road.  How fast am I going?  Are you kidding me?  All right.  I've got a couple of cars in front of me.  I'm going to probably start smashing into them.  Well, be careful.  Be careful.  How the hell with it?  It's worth it.  All right.  Now, what's going on now?  Well, we're starting. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my God.  I wish you guys were here.  No.  Actually, what's that doctor's name?  Dr. Korn?  Yeah.  She's a pisser.  Yeah, she really is.  We're going to have her back on the show.  What you've got to do is see if I can get a chapter in her book.  So, what do you think of the impeachment hearings?  Actually, I'm counting sheep right now.  I want to make sure I last a little longer, you know?  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Put the phone down there.  I've got to talk to her real fast.  Okay.  Hold on one sec.  I'm a little busy.  I got, I'm just, just starting.  All right.  Well, we'll let you love first.  Oh, man.  Thanks.  All right.  See you.  All right.  Wow.  If anyone else is on Route 78, look out.  There's a car that's swerving all over the damn road.  Well, I would say real. 
[00:19:00]  You'd think that was real.  I don't know.  Oh, here comes management.  They're walking down the hall.  I'd like to think.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, but they're not.  They're not coming in.  Figures.  Thanks, Todd, from Jersey.  You got us in trouble.  They're waiting for us to turn the mics off.  Oh, man.  I just punched up the Victoria's Secret fashion show.  You did?  It's online right now, they say.  Well, the pregame is on.  Why?  It's supposed to be what? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, seven?  Yeah, the fashion show starts at seven,  but they got all sorts of pregame stuff going on.  Yeah, but it's real audio or real player, you know?  What am I looking at?  It's all cubey.  Well, it's going to be cool, you know?  They've got to figure this stuff out.  At seven o'clock, they're going to have a fashion show live on the Internet.  Yeah.  I think it'll be good enough to check out and go,  wow, that's kind of neat.  Internet video isn't quite like the Jetsons yet, you know?  Mm-hmm.  When Mr. Slate or Mr. Spacely would be on a big screen going, 
[00:20:00]  you're fired, Jetson!  You know, he's clear as a bell.  He wasn't all cubed out, right?  True.  We're supposed to be at that point.  You didn't have to wait for buffering and stuff.  No.  When he was firing Jetson, it was immediate.  He must have had a cable modem, Anthony.  Yeah.  That looks like Patch.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Hi, what's up?  Nothing.  That was real, man.  You think so?  Yeah, unless she had a pair of marbles in her mouth at the time. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, the acoustics, the rapid breathing.  Yeah, the tone.  She wants to shout on the guy.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we're thinking.  He's a hero to us all.  He's a hero to us all.  That's pretty much illegal radio right there.  And there's probably about 100 husbands wishing they were married to that particular female.  There you go.  Hi, man.  And she's a Joan of Arc of the Oval Office.  Well, cool.  Yeah, I love the show, man.  You guys crack me up.  Hey, thanks a lot. 
[00:21:00]  All right, dude.  Bye.  Well, there's a vote for It's Real.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  Yeah, I'm sorry I missed the show yesterday.  Glad you re-ran it.  And my vote is that's the quality programming I've come to expect from your show.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, thank you.  Now, how old are you?  35.  Right on.  All right.  Thanks.  So I'm in the perfect demographic.  So, you know, that's the kind of audience you want to hit.  Well, you want to hear something like that every once in a while.  Something just out there, right?  Oh, yeah.  My favorite bit you guys have is Cleet Motors. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, we love Cleet Motors.  Oh, man.  Every time I come home, it's like, I heard Cleet Motors.  Come on, let's go.  I know.  The problem is we've played that bit so many times.  I don't know if we can play it today, but we'll play it in the future.  Good, good, good.  Keep that in your repertoire.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hey, thanks.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Thanks, guy.  Keep going.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah?  Yeah, what's up?  She didn't do it.  How do you know?  No, she wasn't doing it.  And if she was, she wasn't doing it right, because he wouldn't have been talking if I was doing it.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:22:00]  He would have never been able to talk.  Well, it's just begun, though.  No, but well, he should watch.  All right, you sound like a passenger side hose bag.  No, because there's no way she can do it.  Listen, I told you guys a few times.  My friend Tony Romano drives home every night from work, takes him an hour.  I told him I'd make him a member of the Hummer Club any night that he wants.  But he's married to someone else or something like that?  Yes, but he doesn't get it.  And you would do it for him? 
[00:22:30]  I told him, drive it home, but he wouldn't be able to drive.  He'd have to pull over.  Oh, really?  Yes.  There's no way.  He wouldn't be laughing and talking, oh, the president, blah, blah, blah.  No, sorry, no.  Okay.  And who's in the background?  All the people you work with?  No, I'm not at work.  I'm home.  Is that kids?  No, I'm listening to your show.  Oh, that's what I'm hearing in the background.  Bouncing back.  Okay.  Are you officially a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  I certainly am.  Look at that.  Girl looks very sure of herself.  I like that.  And how old are you?  I'm 30.  Right on.  That's what we want to hear.  Cool. 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  All right.  I listen to you guys all the time.  You're great.  Thank you.  And please mention something to Tony Romano.  He gets off of work in 10 minutes.  Well, you already have.  You already have.  When are you going to play it?  You are live on the radio.  Oh, well, he's not in his car yet.  Well, someone will tell Tony that you're on the radio and confessing your love for his schween.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Wonderful.  Hi, N.E.W.  That was a superb encore performance.  You like that, huh? 
[00:23:30]  I liked it a lot.  I was wondering, maybe, is there a, like, Tuesday Night Horror Club, like, theme song  that Stephen Lynch could make up for the club?  You know, we haven't asked him for one, but I'm sure he would gladly make a song for us.  I would love to see, like, I would love to hear, like, you know, the whole Scott Muni  two Beatles songs?  Open your show to Stephen Lynch songs.  Yeah, he's becoming huge.  We're making him a rock and roll star, I believe.  It was excellent, my friends.  It was very good.  Matter of fact, before the hour's up, I think we could sneak a Stephen Lynch song in.  Please kill a kitten. 
[00:24:00]  Nah, that one's overplayed.  I think we're going to do the lullaby song.  All right, cool.  All right.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  Yeah, and we are encouraging all the bands out there to send in their Tuesday Night Horror  Club theme songs.  Tom, this fashion show's getting good, man.  Really?  Yeah.  What are they showing?  Lingerie.  I'm seeing Patch.  I'm seeing Nip.  Wait, wait.  This is great, man.  Hold on.  I got my laptop over here.  Come on.  What's the, what's the, um...  God, it's Victoria.  Look at that.  Look, Rick. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, is she hot?  It's victoriassecret.com.  Victoria's with a Ness.  victoriassecret.com.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One more.  Man.  Oh, now everyone else is jumping on it.  Now I'm not going to get through.  Probably, but...  Wow.  They're doing, like, quick clips of these girls just, uh, in their little negligees.  Come on, come on, come on.  Look at that one, Rick.  Wait for a reply, transferring data.  Come on, come on, come on.  Ugh.  Just lop her head off.  She's hungry.  You're a mess.  Come on.  What's the matter? 
[00:25:00]  Dude, you don't even know if you have real player plus loaded in on that laptop.  I'll find out in the future.  That you're bragging about.  I'm not bragging about that.  Opie, it's so cute.  He's got a little...  Ooh, look at that.  No, I got a real laptop over here.  Yeah, he's got a laptop, but you don't know what's loaded on it.  You didn't load anything.  Have some pride, man.  Hook up your laptop.  Update to the newest possible software.  All right.  What do you got on there?  Pong for Windows?  No, man.  I got a T1, and I don't know if I have real player.  I'll figure it out in a second here. 
[00:25:30]  It's taking forever to load it.  Look at you.  Oh.  This stinks.  That's good.  He's flying at 50 megahertz.  Oh, shut up.  You ass.  Anthony, look at this one.  All right.  Oh, my God.  We got to take a break here.  Yeah.  You see if you can hook up with that, Opie.  Why does it say document done?  I don't know.  Oh, right here.  Has the bird chiseled the picture yet, like in the Flintstones?  I'm such an ass.  Hey, hey, Bond. 
[00:26:00]  Look at his picture.  Oh, that was a good one.  Oh, all right.  We're over here looking at, like, girls in lingerie, and Opie's looking at error messages  pinging up on his screen.  Bing, bing.  Damn it.  It's not happening.  All right.  Oh, wait.  I do got a real player.  Yeah, but what version?  Um, doesn't say.  Oh, shoot.  Unable to locate server.  Oh, look at you.  I'm screwed.  Well, everyone else have fun at victorias.com. 
[00:26:30]  We'll help you out.  All right, Anthony.  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Valentine's Day coming up.  Yes.  You better be ready, guys.  What are you going to do?  Last minute?  Get that bouquet of roses or something like you did last year?  Or the chocolate, you know.  The girls look at that.  They see unoriginality.  They see that you don't care.  Well, not necessarily.  Yes, they do.  Girls don't want to see that year after year after year.  It's something different, something new, something they'll love for Vermont Teddy Bear.  All right, and we only got 11 days left, so I think it's time to get on the phone and 
[00:27:00]  take care of this.  It only takes, they told us, what, five minutes?  You call 1-800-829-BEAR.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  And within five minutes, you could take care of your whole Valentine's Day nightmare.  That's right.  They have a bear counselor.  You talk to them about what your girl likes.  You know, what she's into, hobbies, maybe job.  And they could get a bear that fits her little life.  Exactly.  And it'll be very personal, and she will love you for it.  Mm-hmm.  She'll look at you like, oh, my God, he actually thought this out this time. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  And it's so simple.  You know what bear I got for my nephews this Christmas?  What?  Little Jets bears.  Did you?  Now, I'm assuming they could do that for any, you know, NFL team.  Mm-hmm.  Now, that's a good angle as well, because my sister and my brother, huge Jet fans,  had kids recently.  So I said, hey, man, this is a cool thing, you know, to give them.  So there's a Vermont teddy bear dressed up as a Jet.  How about that?  And they have hundreds of bears to choose from, like Anthony said.  They got some really cool ones, too.  They got the Love Bandit bear. 
[00:28:00]  The new one, which is a teddy in a teddy.  That's a dirty bear.  Yeah, it's in a little teddy.  The Cupid bear and the horny little devil bear.  So give them a call.  Definitely.  If you've never given them a Vermont teddy bear, this could be your year.  Girls love this.  Send it to them at work.  I was going to say, a little hint, guys, send it to work, because then they brag to  all the people they work with.  And you put it on their desk or in their cubicle.  It's just like a hero.  You're a hero.  Totally.  So give Vermont teddy bear a call.  It's 1-800-829-BEAR. 
[00:28:30]  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  Or if you're online right now, you can check out their website, www.vermontteddybear.com.  So, Pete and Anthony, usually we have another commercial there, so we can seg back into our  DJ style here.  A little transition.  Yes.  All right.  I think we got the story of the day next.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Goo Goo Dolls, slide from Dizzy Up the Girl and Zeppelin 
[00:29:00]  before that.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  Anthony, a little distracted.  He's checking out the victoriassecret.com website right now.  Well, now I got it running on top of, like, inset in my browser there, so I can go about  my other business.  And take a little peek at it.  On the computer, and it's still right up there, yeah.  Someone called and said they're showing it on the Jumbotron in Times Square.  Is that true?  Yeah, I guess they flashed it up there.  Nice.  I want to be on that someday.  I was doing something really stupid. 
[00:29:30]  It's got to be for the right thing.  You don't want to be up there as, you know, convicted felon Opie.  You think we could tap into that?  Hack in?  Yeah.  Has anyone ever hacked the Jumbotron?  I don't know.  Is that possible?  God, that would be funny, wouldn't it?  That'd be huge.  Put some hardcore smut up there or something.  Or just a message from Opie and Anthony.  Spin some heads.  You know, saying hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Humber Club or something.  Yeah.  Something to look into.  We could try.  A felony.  Well, Anthony, Cheese Man from Queens writes, this message is to Anthony. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  You got me into Half-Life, and now I'm in hot water with my wife.  It goes with the territory.  Also, the only time I can play is when she's in bed.  And who can play at midnight when you've got to get up at six for work?  Later, Fragmaster.  Yeah.  That's Anthony's little name when you're playing Half-Life multiplayer, right?  Yes, of course.  Ah, this poor guy.  I understand.  You know, I got into Half-Life, and my marriage started to suffer.  Jen got extremely upset. 
[00:30:30]  Now, at first, was she into it?  Yeah, you know, she was thinking, like, look over, because the computer, she's got to turn  her head a little to see me on it.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, she was like, well, that's pretty interesting.  Because Sandy's still into the I'm into it phase.  Really?  With me in Tomb Raiders 3.  Yeah, that'll go away.  But I'm having a feeling that, yeah, that's going to change eventually.  Yeah, yeah.  When you're not spending a lot of time, you know, on the couch watching TV with them,  they get upset.  And that's the way it went. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, for hours on end.  I'd get home.  What time do we usually get home?  8.30, quarter to 9.  Yeah, 8.30, quarter to 9.  And, you know, 3 in the morning, 4 in the morning, I'm trotting up to bed.  And I had been on the computer the entire time.  A couple of times, no problem.  Yeah.  But day after day after day, whoo, she got pissed.  And I had to just, like a junkie, like an addict, pull myself away, cold turkey,  and try to do it just every other day. 
[00:31:30]  Mm-hmm.  So now there are certain days I go home, and I sit on the couch and watch TV with my wife.  Now, how bad are you jonesing to turn on the computer as you sit there with your wife watching TV?  Be honest.  Well, I do get a little shaky sometimes.  I look over at the computer, and it's right there.  Yeah.  It's so close.  Yes.  It's like if you're a smoker, right, and you're smoking, and you try to quit.  And the butts, the pack is right on the table.  Mm-hmm.  It's within arm's reach.  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  So I've tried, and I've been doing much better. 
[00:32:00]  Mm-hmm.  I did have a, what do they call that when you fall off?  A relapse.  A relapse.  A little relapse.  You fell off the wagon.  I fell off the wagon last week.  I came home, and as Jen tells me, I screwed up the story yesterday.  I said that I had come home, and she has candles lit all over the place.  A fire in the fireplace.  That's a sign.  She's wearing her little PJs.  That's a sign.  She cooked a wonderful dinner for me, and I went right to the computer. 
[00:32:30]  She goes, you failed to mention you did this two nights in a row.  You didn't catch the signal twice two nights in a row?  No, no, I'll see.  So the second night, she systematically blew out all the candles, looking at me in between each one.  And then the next day, took all the candlesticks, because she is so into candles.  The place looks like some kind of gothic castle, and packed them all away. 
[00:33:00]  She packed them like, you know something?  I tried, but now, no candles ever, ever, ever.  Wow.  And she was fuming, so I definitely had to apologize for that one.  And then the candles came out, and I came home the other night, and the candles lit again.  And now you knew.  And what did I do?  You knew what to do.  I didn't even look at the computer.  There you go.  Not even a fleeting glance.  There you go.  Yeah.  And you had some of that retard sex that you discussed.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Did you get in trouble for that, too, yesterday?  I said that me and my wife had retard sex, because we were just making grunts and drooling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your mom's listening to this, Anthony.  Twice in the morning.  Really?  Pretty good, yeah.  Wow.  Like how lions and tigers do it.  There you go.  And it's done.  And then you'd like roll over and just.  And then like 10 minutes later, you're up again. 
[00:34:00]  That's retard sex.  Okay.  My definition, anyway.  Well, we're still trying to get the perfect definition of retard sex.  Oh, we're getting great ones on the instant feedback, but we just can't read them.  No.  So, Cheeseman.  Yeah, Cheeseman from Queens.  I don't know what to tell you.  You got to play when you can.  You got to get in there.  Like, if midnight is the only time you can play, then what can I tell you?  Yeah.  Have fun.  I'll see you out in the battlefield.  Well, we were discussing this on the way in today. 
[00:34:30]  What happened to the games that you just play and you could shoot through a bunch of levels in an hour?  Oh, no.  All these games that come out nowadays, you're guaranteed, if you're going to see it all the way to the end, to play it for a couple months.  It's very complicated, Opie.  Like, you're on to a new game.  Well, I was playing.  I got to talk about this other one, too.  Mm-hmm.  Wargasm.  I'm controlling an army.  I don't know.  I'm in a battlefield.  I'm flying helicopters. 
[00:35:00]  I'm bombing things.  I don't even know what I'm doing.  I have not a clue.  But it's great.  I mean, I get to wipe out thousands of people.  And then Gangster.  I'm playing that.  Where I'm a Don.  I am a godfather.  And I have to get these lieutenants and cronies underneath them and try to extort money from the locals.  I keep getting whacked within the first ten minutes.  So you're still just trying to figure out what that's all about.  It used to be so easy with, like, you know, Mario Brothers. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  That was it.  Now it takes you months to just figure this stuff out.  Do you remember the noise when you're lost in Mario Brothers?  Wait, wait.  Where is it?  Oh, wait.  No, that was Pac-Man.  Yeah.  Okay.  That was Mario Brothers.  Was it?  I think so.  I think it was. 
[00:36:00]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi.  Hey, what's up?  I was listening to the show, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And my husband is the same way.  He can wake up at 6 or 6.30 and he's on their computer.  Uh-oh.  Causing trouble.  Before he goes to bed, he's on the computer.  It's like I'm invisible.  What is he doing on there?  Anything.  Online.  Online banking.  Oh, no.  He's not banking.  Oh, banking. 
[00:36:30]  No, he's not banking.  See, that's dangerous.  At least I'm playing the games.  He's not banking.  If he's on the computer.  I can't give that one away to the ladies.  Oh.  All right.  We ought to do this one day.  Is this computer right there?  Yeah, it's not on, though.  He's not here.  Do you know how to turn it on?  Yeah.  Yeah, turn it on.  Go ahead.  Okay.  We're going to go into the history file and see where he's been.  No, I can't do that.  Come on.  You're a rat, Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  Come on.  This is always fun.  You're a rat.  Let's see what's in his history file.  Sucksluts.com.  Yeah, that's no banking website.  Yeah, banking.  He's banking, all right.  All right, if you don't want to rat him out.  All right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you, either.  I guess you've got to give him hell like my wife gave me, and you've got to smack him  back to his senses.  So you just have to get noticed and put on a sexy negligee or something, right? 
[00:37:30]  Well, I don't know if that'll work for you, but you ought to give it a try, yes.  What are you saying about this lovely lady, Anthony?  I think about joining the Hummer Club.  Well, that would be a start.  I know.  Is this Juliette Lewis from that movie, The Other Sister?  Cut it out of here.  Poor lady's calling us with a problem, and look at you.  Could you say something for me, honey?  Yes.  Could you say, I want a corn dog?  I want a corn dog. 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  No, she's...  All right.  Well, that was a little test, though.  It sounded a little weird at first.  Yeah, the Hummer thing could work.  I know if I was getting a Hummer every night, I would never go on my computer.  Yes, you would.  I don't think so.  Right after.  After?  Probably in between.  Like, right when the Hummer's done, all you'd be thinking is, I sure would like to get through  that next level.  Yeah, well, yeah, then I would...  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Well, good luck to you. 
[00:38:30]  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm sorry.  I thought she had a little...  That guy's not doing banking late at night while she's sleeping.  Banking?  No way.  Doing the banking, honey.  Yeah.  Very important to do the banking.  He has found some fine chat rooms.  So, I'm 14, too.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's great.  No.  Oh, wow.  You're into field hockey?  So am I.  Yeah.  You're a dirty girl. 
[00:39:00]  My teacher sucks, too.  I'm doing the banking, dear.  You stay in bed.  You ought to go the distance.  Why?  I thought we were all having fun.  You could have just said, yeah, I'm in college, too.  But no.  No.  I'm in fourth grade.  Great.  That's cute.  All right.  We still got the Stephen Lynch song on the way that we promised you guys.  And I think this is the story of the day.  Anthony, the train from Jersey says it all.  He says, guys, you are killing me. 
[00:39:30]  Don't give away the history file access.  You'll ruin it for all online banking married men.  Hey, all I'm saying, guys, is clear your damn files out of there.  If you're going to be visiting those sites, you damn well better clear your files.  Your history, your cash, clear it out.  Your temp folder.  Anthony, you almost hung out a guy to dry when that lady just called.  I gave him a reprieve.  And he should be thankful and take that opportunity now to dump his files. 
[00:40:00]  She wanted to know what the guy's doing late at night on the computer while she's sleeping.  And he's told her that, you know, he's doing banking on the computer late at night.  And Anthony goes, why don't you check out her, you know, the history files of his computer.  And, guys, go to, like, Windows.com and get yourself a good shredder program.  You dump all your files through there and delete them that way.  Because just deleting them doesn't delete them.  Doesn't do the job?  No.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. 
[00:40:30]  Screw the music.  We've got something to talk about here real fast.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And you never know who's going to stop on by the studio.  This beautiful woman decided to come by the NEW studios.  Now, what's your name?  Tara.  Hi, Tara.  Tara.  This is by far the cutest girl we've had in here so far.  Like, when we have girls that come in and they get naked or something or they're in for something.  Yeah.  And we're like, yeah, they're hot.  Well, Tara, usually not.  But, Tara, that's not saying much. 
[00:41:00]  Because we had, like, a skank crack whore that got naked.  Oh, I heard about that.  Yeah, she beat me up.  And she put Christmas lights all over her body and then she beat up Anthony.  Yeah.  And then we had a girl whose ass was so big that she had to walk through that door sideways.  My ass is not big.  No.  No.  It's not big.  There's nothing big.  Well, there's one thing big.  Two.  Now, you called us up about 10 minutes ago and we didn't think you were going to show up.  Now, what's the deal?  You've been in the city all day?  Okay, I've been in the city all day.  And what happened was over this past weekend at the Super Bowl, which, by the way, I also called you guys because I was going to... 
[00:41:30]  Never mind.  Yeah, that's a different story.  But anyway.  All right.  That's fine.  This weekend, my aunt, her brother-in-law just became the president of Playboy.  So, like, you know, I had made composite cards up, like, over the course of, like, the summer.  And I had everything going and I was all psyched.  And then I sent a bunch of letters out to modeling agencies and they sent them all back.  They're like, no, you know, you're not what we're looking for.  You're not what we're looking for.  And I'm like, you know, what are you looking for then, you know?  And it pretty much is what they're looking for is a six foot, no chest, no butt, like, cologne. 
[00:42:00]  And that's not what women look like, you know what I mean?  And, I mean, I think I'm all right.  You know what I mean?  I can hold my arm.  Well, yeah.  I have no problem with it.  Bravo.  Now, how tall are you?  How tall are you?  I'm 5'6 1⁄2".  5'6 1⁄2".  Okay.  I'm 36C.  Yes, I see that.  I have 26 waist.  Yes, I see that.  34 hips, you know.  34 caboose.  I have a nice long leg.  I like that, yeah.  I can sing.  I can dance.  I can practice doing anything you want.  I have blonde hair.  I have blonde hair, you know. 
[00:42:30]  What color eyes?  Brown.  Sometimes they turn green.  That's okay.  It just depends on what kind of mood I'm in.  There you go.  That's all right.  And I don't know.  I just figured I'd call you guys and ask if you could maybe help me out or, you know, just  check me out.  Well, I think we could have our own Victoria's Secret modeling show because I think a lot of people  are having a tough time getting on the Victoria's Secret website.  Yeah, they have their little website thing going on right now.  They're on some kind of fashion show and stuff.  Yeah, I heard about it.  And it's really hyped and everything, and it's hard to get on the site.  We were trying, and I got on for a little while, but then, oh, forget about it.  What we could do is we could take some digital pictures of you, and we could put it up on 
[00:43:00]  our website, and we could have the listeners decide if you're worthy of becoming a model  or not.  Yeah.  That's good to me.  And maybe some of the model agencies are listening, and they could pop on the website  and get a quick picture of you and see what you're all about.  That'd be good.  Are we just doing my face?  What are we doing?  Whatever you want to do.  Believe me.  I can repair myself.  Knowing us and our listeners, they probably want to see more than your face.  Okay, so why don't we take a listener and see what they want to see?  Well, I already know what you want to see. 
[00:43:30]  We don't even have to go to the phones.  I think we could speak for the listeners at this point.  I think we could cover all bases.  We get a nice face shot, full body shot.  Okay, well, since I've been around all day, I've been wearing this shirt.  I don't have a bra on, but I do have underwear on.  So if you want me to throw a bra on, to do like a, well, I guess not then, huh?  A bra.  That would be great.  Well, now, you were looking to get into Playboy.  Is that it?  You wanted to?  Well, you know, I really wanted to be in Playboy.  I called about it, you know, like I said, over the summer.  I was real like, go get it.  Did you send some shots over there, Tom?  Well, what I did was, since my aunt, her brother-in-law is the president of Playboy. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, that's her name.  I was like, she blew me out of the water, man, like all day.  My wheels are going, the smoke's coming out of my ears.  And so what I did was I gave her a face shot of me, you know, just so she's like,  just so she knows I'm not trying to pass a puppy on him, you know?  Sure.  And then she's like, you know, just give me your measurements and stuff.  So I'm waiting to hear from her either today or tomorrow.  See, maybe if he can do something for me.  If he can't, then I'll do it on my own.  Right on.  But I'm aggravated because, you know, once I do get big and I want to have a good attitude about it, 
[00:44:30]  I'm not cocky.  I just want to have a good attitude about it and say that, you know, when I do get up there,  all these people that, like, gave me, like, you know, all the crap in the world,  I just want to give them a big F you on your show.  There you go.  That's what Anthony and I do every day.  There's a lot of people that, you know, are trying to talk us out of our dreams, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we would be happy to take some shots of you, put it up on the web,  and let the people speak.  Speak, and believe me, I know what they're going to say.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:45:00]  Now, Tara's 21.  I've got to warn you, the listeners can be a little brutal.  Okay, that's all right.  One girl that came down and did this a few months ago, she did leave crying.  She did?  She wasn't as hot as she was.  No.  It can't be as bad as Ralph the, well.  What, over on Howard?  On Howard's show?  Yeah.  Ralph's bag.  Yeah.  He should talk, too, that bastard.  Yeah, you want to know what really aggravates me?  Can I tell the story?  Yeah.  We went to the Dysfunctional Family Picnic.  I don't know if it was over this past summer.  Yeah.  And, like, they were all there.  And, you know, he's so brutal.  But, you know, I was standing by, like, where the DJ, like, set up was. 
[00:45:30]  And he was checking me out.  So, like, you know, I'm thinking, you know, maybe I should go and get evaluated and be like,  you know, hey, don't talk to me like that.  Because you were, you know, you were checking me out.  You was looking me up and down a few times.  See, we let the listeners do the evaluating on this show.  See, that's good.  Yeah, see?  Because I think they get a little out of touch over there.  Yeah.  You know?  And they're really hard because.  Yeah.  Well, the listeners, what's cool is you get a whole.  Cross section.  Yeah, cross section of a bunch of different guys out there. 
[00:46:00]  That's cool.  And, you know what I mean?  It's, like I said, I don't think, what I think is what a man wants is a little meat.  Right.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Screw the talking.  We need to start.  All right.  Getting some pictures.  Now, Rick and Ben, you've got to get the lighting just right for her.  Yeah, you've got to do.  I think we can turn some lights around.  You can talk to me.  All right.  You can take the headphones off.  Okay.  Now, what do you want to start with?  I think we need a very lovely face shot.  A lovely face shot.  And who's taking my picture?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, look at that.  Wow.  I like that. 
[00:46:30]  I like that.  Let me get that.  Here, add my face.  Digital camera.  Okay, Anthony.  Give us a smile, yeah.  Wow.  Closer.  All right, take another one.  I've got my nostril.  Oh, let's go.  Take another one.  Yeah.  You keep laughing just before he takes the picture.  That's great.  Okay, slice and laugh.  Yeah.  Just give a nice pose.  Give me a sultry shot.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's good.  That's really good.  I got a tingle.  I know you did. 
[00:47:00]  I was tingling.  I saw that.  All right.  Now we need a full body shot?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's stand up.  All right.  Move that chair out of there, Rick.  All right.  Wait, is the lighting right, do you think, Ed?  Yeah, yeah.  Let us stand right there.  I know what I'm doing.  Perfect.  I like the whole idea.  It's obvious you know what you're doing.  My God.  Okay, let me back up a little.  Sorry.  All right.  I'm drooling.  Let's go.  I'm thinking about having retard sex right now. 
[00:47:30]  Sorry.  I just.  Wow.  We speak our mind on this job.  That's okay.  Are we doing the sultry look?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do the full body sultry look.  That's a great one.  Turn on the air conditioning in the studio.  Is that good?  Wow.  All right.  How about a little of the.  Yeah, you want to turn around a little bit.  Well, you want to.  I guess the over the.  Yeah, penthouse pose.  That's.  Oh, wow.  Nice butt.  Holy.  Jeez.  Man, you almost cursed.  Relax.  I was like, holy jeez.  All right.  Do you got enough body shots, you think, or.  Of that? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I think.  Unless you want to pose her in a different fashion.  Well, are we going to go for the full Monty now?  A little.  We could have some of the guys leave if you want.  These guys are never around when we're doing boring political radio.  And Ben the fag doesn't care about girls.  Yeah.  I won't worry about that.  All right.  All right.  This is going to be for the Playboy shot.  Yeah.  The Playboy shot.  Yeah.  Then we should lower the lighting.  All right.  All right.  Fix the lighting for her.  She's got to feel comfortable.  Yeah.  You know what else I need? 
[00:48:30]  What else do you need?  Whatever you need.  You need water?  Water.  Awesome.  Oh, get the girl some water, for God's sake.  Wow.  She's good.  Very good.  Tractive.  I like that.  Ben obviously isn't a fag because he was the first to get to the water fountain.  You know what?  Then I should leave.  Yeah.  You could strip down while we're waiting for the water.  We won't mind whatsoever.  Not at all.  All right.  Ben's got the water.  Ben's got the water.  Good boy, Ben. 
[00:49:00]  Ben the fag, everyone.  All right.  She's taking all her clothes off.  Taking the big boots off.  That's good.  I like those.  With the heel.  Oh, a little ankle tat.  Oh, God.  Wow.  21, Tara.  Beautiful.  And who wrote she smells good?  Oh, my God.  She smells good?  Would you look at the ass on this girl?  All right.  Now, wait.  Just like that.  How about that ass shot you gave us before? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  You need a couple pictures.  Well, now turn around.  Look at me.  Yeah.  One of those where you show your ass and you're looking around.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Is that a good one?  That's perfect.  You guys are going to love this show.  This is good.  This show.  This is great.  Okay.  Now, a front one with the sultry look.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Harvey Danger, and Flagpole SIDA.  It's Opie and Anthony and the lovely and talented Tara still in the studio. 
[00:50:00]  Anthony is attempting to put all the photographs you just took on the website.  Very, very busy over here, Opie.  I'm hacking away.  How many more minutes do you think you need?  Because the instant feedback is going nuts.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Yeah, that is a good picture.  The guy's going to like that one.  Yeah.  Come take a look at this.  Wait a minute.  Can you flip that one?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look at that.  Oh, that would be the best one right there.  Wow, that's a hot picture.  Wow.  Oh, you see a little ankle tattoo in there, too. 
[00:50:30]  Pretty cute.  All right.  What do you need?  Another 10 minutes, you think?  Well, this might take me quite a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Just give me time.  Don't worry.  I'll get it up there.  Because these guys are just freaking.  I don't doubt it.  And a few women are freaking.  They're like, come on.  Where are the photographs?  Really?  I want to check them out.  If you're just tuning in, Tara called.  She's been going to modeling agencies all day long.  Right?  Yeah, I've been going.  And you've just been.  Well, a lot of them are just saying you're not tall enough.  You know, I mean, they're really not saying you're not pretty enough. 
[00:51:00]  But, you know.  Tall enough.  Well, you're 5'6 1⁄2"?  I'm 5'6 1⁄2".  You know, like I said, I'm 36C, 26 face, 34 hips.  You know, I carry myself well, I think, you know.  Yeah, I certainly do.  You know, I had a nice face.  You had a beautiful face.  Thank you.  Rachel Hunter only.  Ish.  Not, no.  Because you have your own.  Back in her heyday.  Back in her heyday, right.  Maybe, yeah.  A little bit.  She's got the, like.  No, she looks like someone else, though.  She looks like Juliette Lewis' real hot sister. 
[00:51:30]  No.  No.  She's a hot sister.  No.  We'll let the listeners decide when the pictures are up.  I think she's got her own look.  Very cute.  Be nice.  So, the deal is, they don't have a choice.  Anthony took a bunch of pictures of her in all sorts of undress.  Yeah.  Full dress.  No dress.  And now the listeners are going to tell you, you know, what they think of you.  And they could be brutal.  All right.  I can't, I can't see them being that brutal, though.  I swear to God.  Yeah.  I'd be, I'd be surprised if they, if the comments come in, they're really bad. 
[00:52:00]  It's just, you know, guys just being a-holes, I think.  I mean, I'm not, you know, like, I'm not trying to say I'm perfect, but, you know what  I mean, like.  I can see you.  You know, you can work all that out.  When you get into a studio, you do lighting, you do the makeup.  You know what I mean?  I mean, it all helps, you know, and, you know, not that I-  What's your dream?  To be in, like, Playboy, you think?  I want to be in Playboy.  That's definitely my dream.  But, you know, I mean, I would like to, I would like to sing.  I would like to act.  What if, like, swank called or something?  Swank.  No, I want to be, I want to be depicted as classy.  No, all right.  There's Playboy, there's Penthouse. 
[00:52:30]  Would you go for Penthouse?  Um, I would, well, what do the Penthouse pets do?  I mean, do they, like, touch themselves?  Sometimes they're a bit provocative, yes.  Penthouse is just a, like I said, I wouldn't, um.  Just a stage below Playboy.  You wouldn't, you wouldn't go in Biggums or anything, right?  No.  Or Hustler or anything like that.  No, no.  Definitely not.  Biggums.  No?  Definitely not.  I saw one magazine.  Hey, Big, it's my new issue of Biggums.  Biggums.  No?  I want, like, um.  You wouldn't go into Floppers.  No.  Floppers? 
[00:53:00]  There is a magazine called Floppers.  My brother Quinn found it.  It was hysterical.  One day we found it in the.  I don't, you know, I don't want to be, like, I just want to do really Playboy.  I could care less about the, you know, the other magazines.  All right, then I guess the listeners have to look at your pictures and decide if you're Playboy material.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, there we go.  Be kind.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Let me see.  That's a good shot.  Yeah, that is really good.  Let me roll that one over.  All right.  Anthony's getting it all set.  It should be up and done and hopefully in the next 15 or 20 minutes he's propping on it. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, that's a good shot there, huh?  And doing all sorts of stuff.  See, this is the difference with our show, Anthony.  We share with the listeners.  Right.  Because it's one thing for us to just ogle and just lose it looking at a girl after she takes her clothes off.  But then we take the pictures and we put them on the website so all our faithful listeners can check out what we just saw in the studio.  And that's how you'll keep them.  That is the big difference here.  All right.  We share.  Yes, we do.  All right.  We promised a Stephen Lynch song today.  We could do that.  I know. 
[00:54:00]  We could do that while Anthony continues cropping the pictures.  Our pal Stephen Lynch playing Caroline's tomorrow night, Rick.  Tomorrow night Stephen Lynch will be at Caroline's.  All right, Anthony.  The listeners are freaking out.  How much more time do you need?  What's that?  I can't hold them back anymore on the instant feedback.  I'm working on it.  As fast as you can?  As fast as I possibly can.  All right.  You'll have the photos of Tara up and running soon.  Yes.  1027 WNEW, the rock in New York with Everlast, What It's Like from Whitey Ford Sings the Blues.  It's Ophi and Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  And Tara's still in the studio.  And you bastards have made this show come to a complete halt.  I am so trying to upload these pictures of Tara, but I can't even get on it to upload.  I mean, you people are just pounding this site.  I told you, please wait.  Guys, wait.  I know.  She wants her pictures on the website.  Come on.  Just give them like five more minutes. 
[00:55:00]  Everybody get off.  Honestly, we need just a couple hundred people right now to get off the NAW website.  I think we could do it right now as we're on the air.  Yeah.  Someone's got to sacrifice right now.  I'll sing live right now.  No, it won't.  Do do.  Well, yeah.  Eventually, we'll have Tara's pictures up.  I'm trying.  You bastards are clogging.  Yeah, I need to do that.  You're clogging the system right now.  You're clogging it.  Sacrifice it for the team, guys.  Someone's got to sign off the website right now. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, let me see that picture there.  Yeah, let's stick them out of the car.  Oh, look at that.  Take a look.  It's in here.  Oh.  I hope he's just taking a look at more of her pictures.  Did you see the first one?  Yeah, that's good.  Nice.  All right.  Well, I'm trying.  I know.  I know you're trying it.  Desperately.  I know.  We need our listeners to come through.  Well, it's giving me this thing like it wants to connect.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  I might be on to something.  Oh, connection failed.  Thank you.  Oh, too many people still on the site.  Get off.  We're going to catch 22 right now.  Someone's got to take it for the team and log off the website.  It'll happen.  It might happen like at midnight tonight at this point.  But we want you guys to get, you know, to send in your comments.  You have to see the pictures, but we only have an hour left in the show.  Yeah, look at that.  All right.  Do you want to get to the story?  I don't know.  Yeah, look at this, huh?  Well, it's the story of the day. 
[00:56:30]  The story of the day.  It really is.  Screw the impeachment hearings and all that crap.  Who cares if Walter Payton needs a liver?  This is a good news story right here.  It was in Newsday.  It was all over the news yesterday.  Make room for Daddy.  Yoshiko, the chimpanzee, cradles her newborn daughter, Toshi.  Hey.  At the Los Angeles Zoo Monday.  So this chimp has this baby, Yoshiko, but they call her Yoshi. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Yoshi the Chimp.  Hey.  Yoshi a chimpanzee.  Eat.  Pooh.  Well, Yoshi gave birth Sunday to this chimp, but that was a surprise to everyone at the zoo  because, you see, all the chimps at the zoo were vasectomized.  Yeah, they had vasectomies, and, like, one of them was too old and not interested in sex.  Yeah.  So they're trying to figure out who got Yoshi the Chimp pregnant. 
[00:57:30]  Yoshi the Chimp.  Yoshi the Chimp.  Hey!  Yoshi the Chimp, man!  I ride my unicycle in the circus!  Or...  Oh, I don't know, um...  Can there be this cross-breeding, maybe?  What do you mean by that species?  Whoa!  Look who's coming to the door!  All right, damn you all.  Damn you!  Okay. 
[00:58:00]  It was me!  Mr. Heston, it was you?  I...  ...went into the zoo and...  ...had sex with Yoshi the Chimpanzee!  Damn me to hell!  I couldn't help it.  After spending time on the Planet of the Apes, I grew accustomed to that red chimpanzee ass!  Have you ever made love to a chimpanzee?  Ah, no, I can't say I have.  Nothing like it.  Once you go chimp, you never go back! 
[00:58:30]  That supple red ass!  Yearning!  I went to the zoo.  Yoshi spun around and faced that red ass at me.  It was yearning!  Calling me!  As was the burning bush when I played Moses!  Saying, take this, thine red ass upon thee!  Make love to my red chimpanzee ass. 
[00:59:00]  I must admit, I ate monkey meat.  Damn meat I have.  I ate monkey meat at the zoo.  Now, Mr. Haston.  Yes?  Why would you be attracted to a chimpanzee when you had Nova?  Nova.  Yes, she was quite a babe in her loincloth.  But she just didn't have enough bodily hair. 
[00:59:30]  When Zira seduced me in that little cave thing they lived in,  and I did have a threesome with Zira and Cornelius,  I admit it, I ate monkey meat.  I tasted the forbidden fruit of the monkey's red ass.  I couldn't resist.  I visited the zoo and saw Yoshi.  Yeah.  Little Yoshi and that red ass. 
[01:00:00]  My God, forgive me.  Lord God, please forgive me for partaking in the forbidden meat of monkey.  Damn meat of hell.  Now, Mr. Haston, there's a lovely picture of your girlfriend on Newsday.  Look at the cans on Yoshi.  My God.  That's the luckiest baby chimp I've ever seen.  Getting to snuggle against the bosom of that hairy ape. 
[01:00:30]  Damn.  I love that monkey.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll be making more visits to more zoos.  There might be a population explosion of Chartan chimps.  New breed.  The Chartan chimp.  That's right.  It wears a toupee and has a red ass.  Is it true also that you were Caesar's father?  Damn.  Damn.  You found me out.  All right.  My six points with zero. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  It was me.  Well, we got the explanation to the chimp getting pregnant at the L.A. zoo.  Well, thank you, Mr. Haston.  That's great.  I'm so embarrassed.  Can you take your little cherry and get out of the studio?  We got a show to do.  Where's my music?  Oh, you want to?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Off horse.  Yeah.  Play my music.  Damn you.  All right.  I'll play your music.  Damn you to hell.  Now get the hell out of here. 
[01:01:30]  When are you putting those pictures up on the website?  Damn you.  Damn you all to hell.  There he goes, everyone.  Charlton Heston.  Wow.  So it was Chuck Heston that fathered that chimp baby.  Yeah, that's what we're getting at there.  Hi.  Exclusive.  N-E-W.  O-B-N-E-A-T-Y.  Hands up.  Hey, Mr. Heston, once you go chimp, you never go limp.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what I hear.  He ran off in his chariot.  Go get some, man.  Yeah, he just ran.  He's on his horse and he's galloping down the hallway. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, God.  You're making my day.  I'm trying to sit here.  I'm trying to do my little homework over here.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I got to keep on switching back to you.  All right.  Homework.  What grade are you in?  What?  What grade are you in?  I'm over.  I got my bachelor's already.  I'm going for my teaching certification.  All right.  There you go.  Cool.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  Later.  All right.  More stupidity on the way.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  Priceline.com.  Is that what we got here?  Yes, we do.  Okay.  Priceline.  Oh, it's a service that indeed must have been sent by God himself.  God, thank you for Priceline.  We love Priceline.  Mr. Hassen, I thought you laughed.  I was leaving, but I had to come back and talk about Priceline.  What a fabulous service this is.  If only I had this on the planet of the apes. 
[01:03:00]  Yes, I could have gotten a hotel room instead of staying at Zero's and Cornelius's.  Do they even have hotels in Planet of the Apes?  Yes, they're those big pottery looking things.  I say.  Yes, but Priceline could have gotten me a cheaper rate.  Yes, they could have.  Yes.  You know what I had to pay for that room?  How much?  My friend's brain.  They cut out his brain.  Priceline, maybe he could have just had to spend a foot or a hand.  Not a whole brain. 
[01:03:30]  You cut out his brain.  Damn baboon.  Hey, Mr. Hassen, were you smoking some of the wacky weed before the show today?  I have no comment on such things.  Okay.  That would defy the laws of God.  Well, Priceline.com, we love these guys.  Priceline.  If you're looking for a hotel room in the near future.  Yes.  Looking to have some of that retard sex.  Or if it's a monkey meat.  Monkey meat. 
[01:04:00]  And you need a place.  A free night at a hotel with Priceline to dine on monkey meat.  Well, you get the free hotel room if you use their service.  That's right, Mr. Hassen.  Who wouldn't use this service?  It's fabulous.  And this is where you name your own price for a hotel room.  And then Priceline matches that for you.  I could take Nova.  She would love a night at a hotel.  I could wash her up.  She's getting a little gamey.  I was going to say that.  Now, I mean, you haven't held up over the years.  You're starting to look like a monkey at this point, Mr. Hassen. 
[01:04:30]  God, I look like Dr. Zayas.  You sure do.  Look at me.  Now, did Nova hold up?  I ditched her.  You did?  Yes.  She was getting a little old.  A little raggy.  Around the edges.  I need some fresh monkey meat.  All right.  So, if you're looking for a hotel room in the near future, give our pals at Priceline.com a try.  I think you'll be happy with their service.  Priceline.  The service sent from Lord God himself.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:05:00]  The Rock of New York.  Black Crows from by your side.  Ticking my heart around.  And NEW presents the Crows at the Beacon on the 25th, 27th, and 28th of this month.  We'll see you there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And the lovely Tara still hanging with us in the studio here.  Hello.  And we've got to hand it to you guys out there in radio land.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess we just found out that we have a lot of listeners to our radio show, Anthony.  I guess so.  Because we're getting reports from the tech department here at NEW that Tara, you have pretty much crashed our system here at NEW. 
[01:05:30]  He said it's a bigger problem.  Like, it could be like a northeast problem.  Like, this totally...  Everyone's going to be mad at us because they're not going to be able to get online.  Yeah.  Because of us and Tara.  This totally, like, did something to the internet. 
[01:06:00]  We set the internet back like 20 years.  Because everyone wants to see Tara's pictures.  And the email's going nuts.  There's an email somewhere here from a precinct that says the police department from Del Bronx.  And they say, Opie and Anthony, hurry up.  The guys decided to stop fighting crime.  They want to see what Tara looks like.  So they're all, like, hunched around a computer hoping to see the pictures.  Yeah.  There you go.  Now, if you're just tuning in, I guess we've got to go back a little bit. 
[01:06:30]  Tara came into the city today and she's trying to become a model.  Her legitimate pictures are really, really nice.  And you're beautiful in person.  So Anthony and I took some pictures of you.  And we wanted to put them on the NEW website because we like to share with our audience.  Yes.  When we see something really cool in the studio, it's one thing to sit in your car and wonder,  what the heck are the jocks, you know, seeing?  I want to see that.  Yeah.  And most DJs don't give you that chance.  We do.  You know, that's why we wanted to put the pictures on the website so everyone else could take a peek.  Yeah, we wanted to. 
[01:07:00]  And, you know, then we were going to have the listeners comment if you were, like, Playboy material  because you want to be in Playboy.  Yes, I do.  But everyone freaked out.  And they were trying to get on our NEW website and pretty much the system is effed up.  Yeah, something just, like, snapped.  And, uh, well, we can't get anything.  Hi, NEW.  Hey, Obi, Joe Beck.  Joe Bigbutt, how you doing?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  I just tried to email you.  I won't even go through.  It's not recognized in the site.  I know.  I don't know what's going on.  Listen, it's not fair. 
[01:07:30]  I get the biggest butt in the tri-state area, if not the world, to sit on my head.  Yeah.  And the whole world sees it.  And I can't see her in your studio.  A beautiful woman.  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  Not fair.  We have to go to the, we have to go fight the party.  Keep trying.  Now, Joe was the one that we had, uh, Mendy from Bigbutt Magazine sit on his face.  Oh, God, that was disgusting.  For what tickets?  The Pearl Jam tickets?  Maybe the Pearl Jam, 10th row.  Yeah, the Pearl Jam tickets.  Let me, let me just really, uh, make you go wild here, Joe.  It would take 10 of Tara to balance out a seesaw with Mendy. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  I didn't see this girl.  I believe it.  No, I mean, Mendy's cool in her own right.  She loves having a huge mama butt, but, uh, Joe, were you into Mendy's butt?  Oh, no, she was, she was on top of me.  No, not really, no.  I had a lot of fun, though.  Yeah.  I did have a lot of fun.  No, I'd much rather be there now.  And Joe's been with us since the beginning.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Joe.  Absolutely.  You guys feel great.  Yes, thank you, Joe.  All right.  All right, Joe.  All right, Joe.  We're working on it.  We're working on it.  Thank you.  Yeah, so, that's the deal. 
[01:08:30]  Simple as that.  Are we going to, like, do, like, a part two type thing?  I guess we have to.  They, they completely screwed up the internet.  I've never seen this before.  Yeah.  I can't even get instant feedback.  Nothing.  Nothing's working.  Nothing is working.  Because, simple as this, something got crashed.  Yeah.  And Scott Colombo's saying it's a bigger problem now, too.  Yeah.  Like, wiped out the Northeast or something.  Jeez.  Can you believe this?  Well, terror is beautiful. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  I guess, eventually, the pictures will be on the WNEW website.  Eventually.  Yes.  But it's, I don't know.  I don't know if it's going to happen before 7.  I am so working here trying to do this.  I know you are.  I really am.  It brought our show to a complete halt.  Yeah.  It really did.  We can take a couple more calls here.  Hi, N-E-W.  N-E-W.  Hey, what's the deal, dude?  What's the deal?  What happened?  I think all the listeners pounded this site so bad that a bunch of servers crashed. 
[01:09:30]  So, that's it?  Pretty much.  It's not happening tonight.  For right now.  For right now.  Trust me.  We are trying to take care of you guys.  You know?  I don't think N-E-W is used to having hundreds of thousands of hits on their N-E-W website.  Yeah, no doubt.  You know, before now, you went on the website to see an old picture of Scott Muni.  Who cares?  Yeah.  So, I think they might have to update their, I don't know, software and hardware and all sorts of wares. 
[01:10:00]  Underwear.  Underwear.  Whatever.  You guys keep it up, man.  We are.  All right.  Get it going.  Well, you know, eventually you'll see Tara's pictures.  That's all I can say.  All right.  Is this going to happen today?  Maybe tomorrow?  If we knew, we'd tell you, man.  All right.  We are freaking.  We really want them up there, so.  I do get to get feedback.  All right, man.  Cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tara wants your feedback, too, when you finally do see the pictures.  So, make sure you send that in to us.  It'll probably be for tomorrow's show.  We'll have you on the phone. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  So, you can hear what the listeners are saying.  Sounds good.  Yeah.  You guys will freak out.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yo, I just called, uh.  I'm right here.  What's up?  Go.  My internet thing?  Yeah.  They blamed it on you.  Did they really?  I swear to God.  No.  Yeah, I think we caused some major, major internet problems.  I apologize to everybody in the Northeast, but I think we just caused some major screw-up here.  What's your provider?  Uh, some little crappy thing in my town. 
[01:11:00]  And you called them up because you can't get online right now?  I was on your site.  Yeah.  They booted me off.  I don't want to go back on.  Yeah.  Yahoo and any other site doesn't let me on.  Really?  Ugh.  And they blamed it on us?  And I wanted to see this girl.  Well, you will eventually.  Yeah.  We can guarantee that.  Midnight tonight?  Uh, most likely.  I'll be checking back.  All right, man.  I'll call tomorrow to give you the results.  All right, thanks.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  Later.  Hi, NAW.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[01:11:30]  Hey.  I tried calling you guys in the beginning and always got through.  I was the guy who said you grew on people like ear hair.  Yeah.  And now it's like impossible to get through, so I'm sure the internet's got to be going crazy.  You mean to tell me hundreds of thousands of people never got through to see Scott Muni?  Uh, no.  Well, you know the counter on the NAW website before we got here was at 328.  328 hits.  Hey, there's just as many people are listening to the station you're on now at noon so they can hear some biscuits.  I think that the Scott Muni siesta is quite enjoyable to listen to. 
[01:12:00]  Did you say the siesta or the siesta?  Siesta.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Hi, NAW.  Hello.  Yeah.  What's up?  I'm connected on the internet.  Huh?  I'm connected on the internet.  Are you on the NAW website?  Yeah.  And what are you getting?  I got Anthony Obie's face.  Oh, you don't want to see our face.  You want to see Tara's face.  Yeah.  You definitely don't want to see that.  Put it on, man.  I'm in.  While we're trying, what do you think we're doing?  After you get off, we can get off. 
[01:12:30]  I hope he's talking like crazy and I'm barely even looking at him because I'm trying to get these on here.  Anthony just keep, yeah, he's trying everything.  Well, I'm not getting down.  I'm waiting.  All right.  See, that's one of the problems we're having.  There's so many people on the NAW website that Ant's having a tough time uploading their stuff.  Oh, you don't have it uploaded yet?  I'm having trouble with you people.  Listen, I'm waiting to go home.  I understand that.  I can't go home with my wife.  I got to see this first.  There's a huge problem with the internet right now. 
[01:13:00]  The funny thing is, Anthony is catching a lot of hell on the instant feedback that is coming through.  One guy's like, what is Anthony typing with?  Boxing gloves?  Boxing gloves, yeah.  The other guy goes, hurry up.  My wife gets home in 20 minutes.  I got to see the picture.  Right.  I thought my wife could call me any minute now to say, come on home.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're doing the best we can.  We're working on it.  Great show, guys.  Diligently.  Thank you.  We appreciate it.  All right, man.  Take care.  Bye.  Well, I don't know. 
[01:13:30]  Let's take a break and...  Yeah, let's see what's happening here because...  Maybe a miracle will happen.  Yeah, you never know.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Collective Soul, their latest from dosage.  That is heavy.  And we got another WNEW world premiere broadcast of Collective Soul's new album, Dosage, tonight at 11, right here on your damn radio.  And that's brought to you by Nissan Maxima.  So, Opie, it's Anthony, and Tara decided to stick around for the last segment or two of our show. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, Anthony, do you have good news for the faithful listeners of the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, Opie, judging by the instant feedback from Joe and Rocklin, he says, thanks, guys, for the pics.  She looks good.  We got them up.  They are up.  Finally.  My God.  It took an hour and a half.  Now, this will probably crash the system when everyone tries to see them now, but at least they're there.  Yes.  And as long as Tara gives us the permission, we're going to keep them up for a few days.  Is that cool?  That's cool.  No problem.  All right.  If you weren't listening earlier, Tara came in. 
[01:14:30]  She's been trying to become a model, and she's had a lot of doors shut in her face because some say she's not tall enough.  Her boobs are too big, blah, blah, blah.  You get that?  Your boobs are too big?  Yeah, because they're looking for the waist.  Yeah, they're looking for the rails.  You know, they're looking for, like, 107 pounds, six foot tall.  No, I'm not that, and I won't ever be that.  That's not what women look like.  And she wants to be in Playboy, so Anthony took some great photos, man.  Yes, I was the...  Like the photographer.  Yeah.  Boy, that felt good.  You did real well.  I was directing, and she was actually doing it. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  So now the pictures are off for the listeners to decide if she's Playboy material.  Oh, and look, I can't even get any instant feedback, so the server's probably already crashed, but they're there.  They're there.  Hi, Andy W.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  Yo, man, I just got to say two words.  Yeah.  Tara rocks.  Yeah.  Oh, you saw the pics.  Oh, man.  Isn't she hot?  Thank you.  That's one sultry picture you took of her, man.  Which one?  The sultry, yes, the sultry shot.  That was my idea.  That killed me, man.  Isn't that good?  Oh, yeah.  She's got a great face and a great bod. 
[01:15:30]  I like her.  All right.  You guys rock on, man.  Hey, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  And Opie Joe in Jersey wrote saying, retard sexy as a definition.  Yeah.  What your audience is going through, waiting for the bunny to show her ears.  Ant, shake a leg.  Well, I shook, and they're up.  Hi, Andy W.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, Tara.  That little minx is smoking.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, man.  You like that?  Do I?  Take some more pics. 
[01:16:00]  Please.  Give them my number.  Was it worth the wait?  Oh, no doubt about that.  Yeah, you've got to love that.  Thank you.  Much worth the wait.  See, on the Opie and Anthony show, we share with our audience.  Yeah.  Because I used to hate when I was growing up, and I would listen to, like, DJs have naked women  and stuff in the studio.  Yeah.  And you'd be like, man, they're not sharing with us.  You know, they describe it a little bit, but they just sit there, and they lose it, and  then you don't really, you know, you put a picture in your head, but you always wonder. 
[01:16:30]  Exactly.  So we have brought this technology to you guys.  Who needs that Vicky Secrets thing they're showing tonight?  Vicky Secrets?  With that, whatever.  Victoria's Secret.  We have our own little...  Yeah, who needs that?  ...fashion show going on.  Hi, Andy W.  Yeah, this is Jim from Long Island.  Yes, Jim?  Yes.  And I tell you, Dara really is hot.  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  It's so just...  I put a picture of my wallpaper on my computer.  Every time it's going to come on, she's going to be there.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, I'm one of your listeners from BAB.  Whatever happened to Repo Man and the Convict?  Oh, my God.  Espo, my buddy, he's doing fine.  Cool.  Espo works at the Burger King in Huntington.  You should get back on the show.  Yeah, we definitely will.  Oh, that's right.  Opie's cute little show he had on BAB.  I got to go, man.  Boo, boo, boo.  All right.  Right on.  Did you get any instant feedback in?  Because I can't get the instant feedback working at all.  I'm trying to get it working, but man, it's just jammed up.  Because we want to see what the listeners think of Tara. 
[01:17:30]  You know what it is, though?  I think a lot of the people that can get through to the website aren't wasting time on the instant feedback, Opie.  Well, I understand that.  They're looking at the pictures of the lovely Tara.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, guys, what's up?  I'm doing 100 miles an hour on the huts right now, trying to get home to see these damn pictures.  Well, be careful.  You don't want to cause any accidents.  But they're well worth it.  Yeah, you guys are the best.  Hey, thanks, man.  Take it easy.  Don't get a speeding ticket.  Nah, don't worry about it.  All right.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Tara, you're a hit, man. 
[01:18:00]  If we have all the cops listening right now, don't give anyone a speeding ticket.  Yeah, they're just trying to get to their computers.  That's all they're trying to do.  And remember my face now.  Yeah.  Very good.  Hi, N.E.W.  Anthony.  Yeah.  You're the man.  All right.  How's it going?  I finally got him up there.  And she is beautiful.  Isn't she?  She's extremely beautiful.  That's so great because a lot of times girls come into the station.  A lot of DJs talk about him and talk him up.  And somehow, someway, you see him.  And what do they look like? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, she's beautiful.  Well, sometimes they're slobs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sometimes they end up to be slobs.  Thank you.  But Tara, lovely.  All the luck.  Thank you very much.  All the luck.  All right.  You guys are doing great.  All right.  Thanks, man.  See you around.  Take it easy.  All right, then.  See you, man.  Sharing with our faithful audience, Opie.  That's what it's all about.  Hi, N.E.W.  How you doing?  All right.  What's up?  I just wanted to say, Tara's looking hot.  Yeah, huh?  Yep.  Thank you.  And is this Opie and Anthony? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  How you doing?  Got you good.  I'll tell you what.  That Ralph is a total fag over there.  It's how it turns out.  What a fag.  Yeah.  He said there was anything wrong with her.  No.  He's gay.  He's gay.  The day is long.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Open air there?  Yeah.  This is like making my day today.  This is great.  Thank you. 
[01:19:30]  Unbelievable.  I needed to test a long day at work.  See?  That's all we're trying to do.  Oh, natural.  Let me tell you.  Perky up after that.  Oh, thank you.  Very nice.  You like that part of it, right?  Excellent stuff here.  All right.  Guys, keep it up.  Hey, thanks, man.  Take care.  All right.  Well, the reviews are coming in.  You're a hit.  Yeah, you're definitely a hit.  I'm kind of surprised.  I'm sure there's going to be...  No, I'm reading the instant feedback, and it's looking good.  Yeah.  I'm glad.  I don't know.  Why don't, you know...  Man, is she hot.  I'd like her to do a velvet tongue or the I don't know how big it's going to get routine  on me. 
[01:20:00]  Hey, here you go.  Now you're going to get that.  Does that disturb you at all?  Like, thinking that some of these guys, you never know what they're going to be doing  in front of their computer?  They're men.  It's okay.  I mean...  You know, because if you stop them, you know...  You could end up being, you know, some kind of a...  Green Target, if you know what I mean.  Well, that's a good...  Guys tend to do that.  Now that's my mind.  Sometimes guys tend to do that on these computers, just being brutally honest.  That's all right.  Hey, it's all good, right?  Yeah, why not? 
[01:20:30]  Where's the beaver shot?  Oh, my God.  I'm just reading what's coming up here.  I'm sorry.  You know, what the heck, man?  Where's the beaver shot?  What?  It's just our listeners.  They're harmless.  Playboy, not Penthouse.  Oh.  All right.  Or maybe it's a lot of shadow on the camera.  Do you keep yourself well trimmed and velcroomed?  Very, very well trimmed.  Very good.  Hey, what's up?  Heyo?  Yeah.  Where's that guy on the hutch?  Should I pull him over now or later?  I'm going 100 miles an hour. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, you leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Hey, the guy's all over the moon.  Go find a crackhead.  All right.  Listen, this is what I do for a living, all right?  I understand.  Well, you got to tell us slow down.  Hey, listen, is she as hot as you say she is?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Definitely.  Without a doubt.  If you got a computer...  Yeah, I think so.  So tell her to go over to Harvard tomorrow morning and see how she does over there.  Oh, God.  She's working, guys.  Take care.  All right, man. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  We leave it to the listeners.  Yes, we do.  We can't make those judgments, you know?  Well, the listeners love you.  Absolutely love you.  We can't even get more instant feedback.  I know.  Everything's jamming up.  Everything's jamming up.  You're a rousing success.  I think she deserves a big hand.  Thank you.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  I'm looking forward to seeing any kind of spread in one of the magazines.  I'll even autograph it for you and bring it in for you.  Wow. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  For you guys, anything.  All right, Tara.  So those pictures will be up for a while?  Oh, yeah.  We could hang out some more, dude.  Oh, really?  Yeah, why not?  Hey, Gray, why not?  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony and Tara hanging in the studio.  Yeah.  Everybody checking out the pictures on the WNEW website of the lovely Tara.  Finally able to get them online.  Yeah.  Yay.  And they're there.  Tara came in and she let us take pictures. 
[01:22:30]  Some awesome shots.  Yeah.  And you get a bonus.  There's a bonus in those pictures for the faithful listeners.  There's a shot of Ben the Fag in the background in one of the pictures.  Which picture?  It's one.  I believe it's the sultry shot.  And he's in the background and he says he's not gay.  Right.  He says he's completely straight.  Yeah.  And you look at him in that shot and he's completely disinterested.  Really?  He's not even looking.  He's just kind of, you know, looking away or something. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now, where is Ben?  Ben, come on down the hall and take your abuse.  Take your abuse like a fag.  Like a fag.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, it's me.  All right.  Those pictures of Tara?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, man.  What?  How are you?  What?  What are you?  Yeah, that's exactly how we felt.  I'm looking for words, man.  Speechless.  Thank you.  You know what's cool about it?  It's, um, she's natural. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  She's natural.  You know what I mean?  Definitely.  She's just got it going on, and it's, it's, it's.  What most women look like, you know?  No, no.  Trust me.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Trust me.  It is not what most women look like.  That's what they should look like.  You're going to put some more pictures up there?  Look at you.  Well, I'm just saying.  It's like, you say what most women look like.  Well, it's what most women should look like.  Definitely.  You know?  I mean.  Yeah.  Plastic's all right, but it only goes so far.  No, I'm talking about, like, the, the big fat pigs that are walking around, you know? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah?  Because they, they turn around a lot of times and go, this is natural, and this is what  a woman's supposed to look like.  It's like, no, now you're taking it to an extreme.  Just a little too far.  Yeah, a little too far.  Hey, black girl.  Wow.  What do you think?  I haven't seen them yet.  She's right in front of you.  Oh, she's lovely.  You haven't seen them yet?  Oh, she's lovely.  She's lovely.  She's gorgeous.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Where's Ben?  Ben, Ben is, Ben left.  Ben left.  Ben left.  There's a hot girl in the studio. 
[01:24:30]  Ben goes home.  Ben leaves.  There's this.  I figured.  There's sales guys that, that are still hanging around.  They usually go home at 3.15 and they're still here.  And Ben left and went home.  Oh, that's great.  Oh.  All right, Earl, go over there.  Ant's got the pictures right up over, or do you, Ant, or no?  Oh, yeah.  I'll, I'll pop them right up.  You can take a quick look.  We'll get the, uh, we'll get the, uh, we'll get the Earl, uh, the official Earl opinion.  Look, very nice, uh, face shot there.  A nice sitting shot. 
[01:25:00]  Your calling is to be a photographer.  Oh, maybe.  Look at that.  Here's the sultry shot.  Look at that.  And look at, look at Ben the fag, who I believe looking at this is looking at me taking the picture.  Jeez, Ben.  Oh, my God.  Then we have, ooh, look at that, huh?  Yeah, that's.  Yeah.  Now we're getting down to the, uh, pant list.  Very essential.  Got the panties on and she's got the, the little, uh, uh, uh, like tank top thing, but it's got a little spaghetti straps on it. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  And then she's pulling it off, exposing her belly.  Oh, man.  And her panties.  Pink panties?  Uh, yes, they are.  Yes.  Yes.  They are.  Now she's pulling the top down a little bit.  Just exposing cleavage.  This is a recap.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, still, of course, with your hands off.  Well, this is for our blind listeners.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm doing that thing like those people were doing at the Super Bowl when they  were singing the national anthem.  And she was having a convulsion at the bottom of the screen for the deaf.  See, I'm doing this for the blind. 
[01:26:00]  This is so the blind at home could spank it, too.  This is like, uh, braille smut.  All right?  Pulling it down.  Then we have the shirt completely off, but she's still holding it, you know?  Kind of toying with you.  Getting ready to throw it.  I might put it back on, and I might not.  You don't know.  And then we go down to the bottom, and of course, she threw the shirt away.  There you go.  And, uh, yeah, you see a little anklet tattoo. 
[01:26:30]  Just for you, Anthony.  Very nice.  Very nice.  So, Earl, what do you think of that one?  Full breast.  Ooh.  And don't say lovely.  Come up with something better than lovely.  I'm speechless.  I'm totally speechless.  Okay.  Yeah.  Very nice.  I gotta say.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what's up?  Dude, what the hell has been the fact thinking?  Is that on his ankles?  Do you see it in the picture?  He's looking at me taking the picture.  Oh, man.  I'm not a guy for internet porn, but damn, Tara. 
[01:27:00]  Thank you.  Very nice.  I really appreciate it.  You've got to do great work.  You've got to get set up for, like, all of eternity.  Oh, man.  Look at this guy.  He just made his day.  Hell, you made my wheat.  My gear.  Tara, you want to go out sometime?  All right, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Don't let your mom catch you, people.  Yeah, really.  All right, listen.  Flavio.  This guy's hysterical.  I had to rush through dinner to get back to my computer. 
[01:27:30]  I told my wife I had to do some online banking.  Thanks for the pictures.  She's great.  Yeah, online banking.  He's going to be making a deposit.  Oh, man.  All right.  Well, Tara, you were a huge success.  I haven't seen one bad instant feedback, to be totally honest with you.  You had to know it, you know?  Well, why don't other people see that?  You know, the ones in the suits and the ties that make the decision, you know?  We were pretty, uh...  I don't know.  But I think you guys are great, and I'm really glad you let me come on and do this. 
[01:28:00]  No problem.  It really means that to me.  I'm going to leave here crying because I'm so happy.  Well, you're welcome back at any time.  Believe me.  You're welcome to call me.  I'll be happy to oblige.  You need a shoulder to cry on, or...?  God, and you've got a sexy voice, too, by the way.  Thank you.  Yeah, you've got a good radio voice.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  I thought you had to sound like a man to be on the radio if you're a woman.  No.  No, I do.  Every time I hear a woman on the radio, it's just sound like a man.  You want to know the chicks that bend the fag, they sound like men. 
[01:28:30]  You want to know the truth?  Every girl that sounds hot on the radio is a mess.  Yeah.  An absolute mess.  Mm-hmm.  Mess.  That's usually the case.  So I've got, like, a package deal going on here, right?  There you go.  All right.  Yeah, definitely.  Thanks, guys.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, man.  I definitely give Tyra my vote.  Yeah.  Yeah, she definitely gets the vote.  As you guys are going through the recap, I'm sitting here going through the pictures.  I still have them on the browser.  You were playing along at home.  Oh, yes, I was. 
[01:29:00]  Look at the fun.  Look at the fun you're having.  Yeah, it was great.  I was kind enough to sign off and just keep the pictures on my browser.  Oh, that's nice of you.  So that everybody else can get a nice view.  Of course.  Save the page and sign off.  We've got to share the wealth.  Yeah.  What's your favorite picture?  Let's see.  The pose with her picking up her shirt, you know, ever so much to expose her panties is  definitely a very sexy picture.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wait, wait. 
[01:29:30]  Let me get to that one now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  With the hair is kind of in front of one eye.  Yeah.  And she's looking down.  Yeah.  With that teasing look.  That seductive look.  Yes.  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you're a dirty girl.  Then the one next to her, right before that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  She's pulling down the spaghetti straps.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're all...  She definitely...  She has a beautiful smile.  Thank you.  Of course.  Very nice face, too. 
[01:30:00]  On top of that.  Beautiful smile.  We were surprised when she came in.  Hey.  Well, we were.  Well, believe me.  You should see sometimes what comes in here.  Yeah.  When women call and say, hey, I want to, like, you know, come up and do something for you  guys.  We're like, oh, great.  What does this mess look like?  Yeah.  And then we got to make believe on the radio that she's hot.  It's just a whole mess.  Yeah.  On page one.  Now, go back to page one.  I'm on page one now.  Okay.  Now, you see the first picture?  First picture with someone in the background.  That's Ben the Fag. 
[01:30:30]  That's Ben the Fag.  No, no.  That's what the next one is.  That's producer Rick.  Oh, that's Rick.  I'm sorry.  That's the first picture.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, he's not looking at her.  He's looking at you.  He's looking at me taking the picture.  Yes.  What a fag.  Isn't that great?  We're glad you enjoy the pictures.  Yes.  On my ride home, you were actually saying something about the full Monday.  So, I wonder if there was going to be a part two. 
[01:31:00]  We're going to have to talk to her manager.  We'll have to see her.  They want to call me back.  And you're missing one shot.  What shot?  One shot.  We thought we had a whole cover.  She has a very seductive look.  But no, if you go back to, what is it, like picture four on the second page?  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me click up the second page.  Second page.  All right.  Now, let me go to picture four.  Second page, first picture.  She still has her clothes on.  Yeah.  Okay.  You need a picture like that with no clothes on.  There's no picture of her rear. 
[01:31:30]  Well, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know something?  I have one.  I just didn't post that yet.  Oh, he's keeping them for himself.  Yes, I'm keeping that for my home collection.  Yeah.  No, I have a couple of other ones.  I guess I could post also, but I didn't put them all up yet.  Oh, okay.  Are you going to be posting them out later at a later date?  This is like naked Hanukkah.  You have to wait a couple of, you know, throughout a couple of days.  You get one present every day.  Of course. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  All right, man.  Okay.  Take care.  Good talking to you.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye-bye.  These are too good.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  You have it holding?  Yeah.  No, you're on the air live.  What's up?  What's up?  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How you doing?  Yeah, there's a delay.  Turn your radio down.  With all due respect.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, she's a really cute girl.  Uh-oh.  Tara, no offense, but.  Uh-oh.  You're not, you're not, you're not playboy material.  Why do you say that?  Give me a reason.  She's really cute.  Give me a reason. 
[01:32:30]  You guys there?  Yeah.  Where, where, where?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Uh, you know, she's a really cute girl, but, I mean, the thing is this.  Uh, I must be crazy or something.  I'm engaged.  I'm not a failure or anything like that, but, you know, 36C, I'd buy it, but they're a little,  you know, they're not 21-year-old breasts.  What are you talking about?  I mean, from the pictures I'm seeing, they're a little low.  A little low?  Playboy, if she's going to be in Playboy, she needs implants, the bottom line.  Oh, my God.  I mean, no, I'm serious.  She's a cute girl.  Beautiful face.  Very nice, but, uh, I see Playboy, no swank, yes. 
[01:33:00]  Well, wow.  Playboy, no swank, yes.  That was real necessary.  Thanks a lot.  Well, I'm not being honest.  I'm being very honest.  You know, there's a difference between being honest and being rude, and you could have just  said that maybe implants would have been better, and not swank.  Don't you think?  Wow.  I'm just busting them.  Come on.  It's the show.  It's the part of the show.  Okay, let's go.  This guy's using our excuse.  You can't use our excuse, dude.  Come on.  Let's all out.  Guys, you're being very nice to it all, but, I mean, I'll say, a very cute girl, and I 
[01:33:30]  look at her in the street, absolutely.  But if she play, but come on, you open a Playboy up, you'll be spending, what, $3.50, $1 or $4?  You're going to be a little disappointed.  You know, give me a break.  Why don't you give me a break?  I mean, I'm standing here, and, like, you know, I don't have, you know, much makeup on.  It's not, like, the perfect lighting.  I'm sure if you don't have a little help.  Tara, you don't have to defend yourself.  Don't worry.  Listen, this is justified for round two of that.  Goodbye.  Some guys are into the, some guys are into that plastic, plastic look, where it's just  the big implants and the, you know, that whole plastic thing.  His fiance looks like it.  Hi, N.E.W. 
[01:34:00]  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  What's the website?  Oh, come on.  Jesus.  You're, like, an hour behind everyone.  Oh, WNEW.com.  Please?  Click on the Opie and Anthony pictures, and you'll go from there.  No, no, no.  The main site, though.  Oh, WNEW.com.  That's it?  Yeah.  Giddy up.  All right.  This guy's the guy that walked into the room to take the test with his pencil when everyone  said, pencil's down.  Right.  It's over.  It's over.  Hi, N.E.W.  I am completely against the plastic look.  I think this girl's beautiful. 
[01:34:30]  She has the most beautiful eyes.  I think the plastic look is fake.  Yeah.  Well, that's all I have to say.  You can see that in all the ads in the back of the magazines, all the fake stuff, you  know?  Yeah, yeah.  He was like, oh, yeah, I'm only doing it for the show.  Well, if you have an idea, then have the idea.  But personally, I think she looks beautiful.  Yeah.  Her eyes are, like, beautiful.  Without a doubt.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Later.  There you go.  See, you feel better now, Taron?  I am.  They're on your side.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yo, you guys know you have the most brutal listening audience around. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  We know that.  Everybody, don't get disheartened by that one, like, porno connoisseur.  Like, that guy knows what the hell he's talking about.  Like, you're a woman.  You know, I mean, you've got a body.  You look great.  I mean, no, he doesn't know what he's talking about.  The plastic look is old.  Thank you.  You're the real deal.  I mean, listen, you saw what they did to that Bronco.  These people can be brutal to him.  Yeah.  So, if they're all saying great things, don't get disheartened by that.  It's kind of strange, though.  That's why we love our listeners for being brutally honest.  But you know what?  You guys are brutal yourselves.  Yeah, we know that. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, and we take some hard hits on ourselves.  Oh, man.  One big, happy, brutal family.  There you go.  One big, dysfunctional family.  Go on, Taron.  Thank you.  Hi, N.E.W.  I want to, you know, move on here, but the callers are just going nuts.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hi.  Yeah, I saw the pictures on the web.  Yeah.  Yeah, she looks great.  Is that a wedding ring she's wearing?  Yes, it is.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there go half my listeners.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry to expose you on the air or something, but I kind of killed the entire half the rest 
[01:36:00]  of my day waiting for those pictures to come up.  No, that's fine.  Hey, I'm just, hey, I'm trying to be, you know, I'm high candy, okay?  Sorry, you still look great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I figured we had to send in an Alfie for you to get those pictures on the web sooner.  Yeah, I know.  We got them up.  That's all right, though.  All right, man.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, man.  Later.  Bye.  I mean, the phones are nuts.  We could just answer for the next hour.  But, of course, we have to move on to other things here at N.E.W.  What could possibly beat this? 
[01:36:30]  Well, you never know.  What?  I don't know.  Maybe there's something planned between 7 and midnight or whatever, and it's huge, and  it's just...  You mean we got a new DJ?  I don't know what's going on here.  Oh, all right.  I doubt it.  I was just confused.  That's all.  You just never know.  Maybe something...  Hi, N.E.W.  This is Opie?  Yeah.  Hey, Tom.  Bayshore.  Hey, Tom.  Tom, what's up, man? 
[01:37:00]  Hey, how are you?  Listen, what do us idiots that are still living in the dark ages do that don't have a computer?  Oh.  You got to find a friend.  Oh, man.  You got to find a friend.  This is not fair.  This is the best we could do for you guys right now.  No computer.  Take your word for it, because I met you, I know you, and she's got to be good.  Sell that big screen TV we gave you and buy a computer.  And you guys, like, transmit them through the TV?  Web TV, baby.  Yeah, web TV.  All right.  Oh, man.  All right, man. 
[01:37:30]  Take it easy.  Bye.  Later, man.  Bye.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  Who comes on after O.B. and Anthony?  I don't know her name.  Who comes on?  Is there another DJ afterward?  Well, we've had a memo that says that we're not allowed to mention the next DJ's name.  We're not allowed.  Oh.  It's in the memo.  Oh, okay.  So we just run.  Because you guys are being really brutal to whoever it is.  To who?  I don't think so. 
[01:38:00]  No.  She deserves every bit of it.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We almost had gotten through two or three days without an issue.  Oh, no way.  Without an event taking place.  The crap I'm hearing, trust me, it will come out.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks for that, guys.  You guys are good.  Hey, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Screw her.  Oh, we almost made it.  Now I'm in a bad mood. 
[01:38:30]  Let's get out of here.  You're not heeding the memo, Opie.  What memo?  I don't know.  I threw it away.  Was it CC to me?  I don't remember getting a memo.  I threw it away, too.  All right.  Well, we've got to thank Tara for coming by.  Thank you.  The lovely Tara.  Thank you for coming in.  Thank you.  Good luck in any of your naked endeavors.  Okay.  And your clothed ones.  But I'll be paying attention to the naked ones.  Okay.  Thank you.  And don't let that guy get you down.  There's hundreds upon hundreds of great emails from our listeners.  I told you there'd be one. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Well, there's always one or two.  Yeah, there's got to be.  And you should consider legitimate modeling, too, because you would have a beautiful face.  Oh, I definitely want to.  Definitely.  I told you I want to act.  Don't have to necessarily just do Playboy.  No.  No.  That's just a fantasy.  You know what I mean?  All right.  All right.  All right. </pre>
