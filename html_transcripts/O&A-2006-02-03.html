<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio broadcast opened with a dramatic intro depicting a "virus" spreading through radio, setting the tone for a chaotic and outrageous show. The broadcast began with a recap of the previous day's "Super Bowl of Pain," a testicular torture contest culminating in a contestant, Matt, getting stung numerous times by a yellow jacket nest placed near his scrotum. The hosts marveled at the fact no bees escaped the studio, and listeners called in praising the event as “the best ending in radio history.”  Photoshopped images of the hosts in beekeeper suits were also discussed.  The unexplained departure of guest Tracy Morgan was speculated upon, with suggestions that the bees scared him off, alongside the earlier departure of Michael Winslow during a segment involving sexual acts performed in front of celebrities.  Plans for a "Super Bowl II" were discussed, along with the viral popularity of online video clips from the stunt and the upcoming, but doubted, American Mess open call. The hosts also mentioned the success of Dane Cook's stand-up, expressed concerns about MySpace predators, and planned a DVD release of their most outrageous moments.  Upcoming guests Patrice O'Neal and Gavin were mentioned, and an EMT from the event called in to describe the contestants' injuries.

Opie then recounted a bizarre car crash he witnessed outside his restaurant, where the driver recognized him while being loaded into an ambulance.  The show then transitioned to a discussion about the New York Islanders' poor performance, interspersed with listener calls, including one from a Rangers fan.  A caller incorrectly informed them that Jimmy Norton would be on "Dateline" (actually "20/20"), leading to speculation about their limited screen time.  The conversation shifted to Opie's Super Bowl party, including jokes about seating arrangements and E-Rock's chicken wings, followed by Opie's disastrous tuna-searing attempt.  Another caller corrected the Jimmy Norton appearance details, explaining that the "20/20" segment would focus on sexual predators.  A further recap of the "testicular torture" contest occurred, detailing the use of mousetraps, waxing, and bee stings.  Raphael, a participant, called in to describe his sore testicles.  Video footage was promised for opianthony.com.

Patrice O'Neal called in, complaining about VH1’s post-production and excessive radio interviews, criticizing other radio hosts for their lack of improvisation.  He recounted a particularly negative experience with Man Cow’s radio show, using highly vulgar and offensive language to describe the encounter.  The hosts extensively discussed Patrice's interactions with Man Cow and other radio personalities, employing significant amounts of offensive language throughout.  Audio clips from the previous day's "testicle torture" segment were played, along with listener calls focusing on the Man Cow show and a discussion about a fake Opie MySpace account. Additional details of the "testicle torture" segment were shared, including the use of wasps. The segment concluded abruptly due to a technical cut-off.

The show then continued with "Super Ball Thursday," detailing the chaotic climax where Matt had a jar of wasps dumped on his genitals.  The audio cut off mid-panic.  The hosts planned to add sound effects to the clip. Comedian Frank Caliendo, a guest, discussed his work on *MADtv*, his experiences with Terry Bradshaw, and his impressions.  He also mentioned future appearances and possibilities for a more elaborate "Super Ball Thursday."  Pamela DeBar, a self-described former rock star groupie, was interviewed.  She recounted her relationships with musicians like Jimmy Page and Mick Jagger, providing explicit details about her sexual encounters with them and comparing their sexual abilities.  She promoted her book, *I'm With the Band*, and discussed the differences between her approach to being a groupie and that of "Superhead."

A segment discussing Pam, a "trusted hoe" who had relationships with numerous men in the music industry, ensued.  Highly offensive language was used to discuss the nature of these relationships.  The conversation transitioned into a lengthy and vulgar discussion about circumcision, with guest caller Carlos Mancilla promoting his Atlantic City show, and much offensive and sexually explicit language and imagery being used. Mancilla’s call was interrupted by the hosts' riffing on circumcision. The conversation moved to listener-created audio remixes of a previous Emily Stern segment, followed by more offensive jokes and discussions about race and genitalia, including commentary on a magazine photo.  A "Brokeback Mountain" remix was played, along with other remixes of the Emily Stern segment.  A planned drive-by shooting range skit was mentioned. A listener called in, continuing the discussions about race and offensive terms.  Patrice O'Neal and Gavin were in studio during this segment, with Jason Fisher joining later to discuss his Lenny Bruce portrayal, prompting further discussions about racial slurs and their power, again with extensive use of offensive racial slurs and profanity.

The show concluded with a substantial segment featuring Jason Fisher, discussing his Lenny Bruce one-man show. He discussed the challenges and reactions from people who knew Bruce. The hosts and Fisher debated Bruce's legacy, sincerity, and whether his material holds up today. A comedic bit featuring a criticized Rich Voss Lenny Bruce impression was played.  The conversation shifted to a discussion on the use of racial slurs, specifically the n-word, prompted by a news story about a suspended teacher. The hosts and guests engaged in a raw and unfiltered discussion about the word's power, usage, and context.  The segment ended with plugs for Fisher's show and other appearances by the hosts, along with listener calls.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  I repeat, I repeat, I repeat.  We're on the first switch.  And set it to serve. 
[00:03:30]  Get ready.  Get shown.  Permission to freak out.  Go.  And begin.  We're the talk of the industry.  After me.  That's the way it's always been.  The outcast of radio.  Oh, bastards.  No one truly wants our radio show.  No one has balls anymore.  Your balls are showing.  Big, beefy, hanging, swinging nuts.  Throw the second switch!  Wow, this is even better than I imagined.  Love you, Elfie.  Love you, Anthony.  Boy, we're going to have great fun.  Love you, Ben.  Love you, Steve.  I hope you brought a big bag of smiles.  O-N-A. 
[00:04:00]  O-N-A.  You two are going to hell.  Shut up.  Kill yourself.  Throw the third switch!  Only an enemy, the virus is spreading.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it!  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  It's Friday! 
[00:04:30]  Friday!  It's Friday!  Okay, terrific.  We kinda knew how to quit, you.  Yeah, here. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Oh, stop, oh, stop.  I can't breathe.  Stop.  Stop. 
[00:05:30]  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  I guess this could be the post show from yesterday.  Yeah, that ended abruptly yesterday.  And it just ended abruptly a few minutes ago, I think, in the replay, right?  Yes.  Right?  Yes, I was listening on the way in.  So we could kind of just continue now.  Yeah.  I'm so bummed we couldn't go late yesterday.  Yeah, it's one of the difficulties we have here.  But Ron and Fezwell allowed us to go late. 
[00:06:00]  It's a computer thing.  Yeah, the computer automatically shuts the show off.  And what?  Then it has to reboot?  Then it resets all of its parameters for Ron and Fez.  I don't know.  Oh.  So at a certain time, it just has to cut no matter what?  It has to stop.  Oh.  It has to stop, or it could mean the satellite explodes.  And then four minutes later, it's on again for them?  Yeah.  That's weird.  It's got to take a little break.  The panic I was feeling yesterday at the end of that show, because we knew we had something 
[00:06:30]  with the bees and the wasps.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, to be honest, nothing was really happening with those bees and wasps.  They had their junk in the little units that we made up, and nothing was happening.  They weren't getting stung.  They weren't getting stung.  We needed bee stings on ball bags.  Yeah.  Then a couple of the guys stepped up mad, I guess.  Well, they went to Extreme Measures to get the ending we needed.  Extreme Measures, Anthony. 
[00:07:00]  Think about it.  Above and beyond.  When I believe it was Matt, was he the one that had the paper wasps?  He had a yellow jacket nest.  Yeah, an entire nest, like broken up into some pieces, but it was an entire nest.  He put his bag in the jar and tipped it back so that the bottom of the nest, which was  loaded with bees, wasps, was right up against his bag.  Is it safe to say there were like 30 or 40 in this little jar?  At least.  It was probably closer to 80. 
[00:07:30]  They were just stacked.  They were piled on top of each other.  Top of each other.  And he tipped the bottle so they were laying on his bag.  And then, bam, he just got stung multiple times.  And I was having panic attacks, anxiety attacks, because I have the stopwatch here.  E-Rock gives me the stopwatch every day.  And I'm seeing the show just counting down.  And we're not going to do no fake ending bullshit.  No.  And I'm like, holy crap, we don't have an ending here.  It's just going to end. 
[00:08:00]  And then all of a sudden, that fucking Matt guy just lost his mind.  He was getting stung like crazy.  We started losing it, because now he wants to just pull the jar off his nutsack.  So we're screaming like, no!  Well, you know, you probably just heard it.  Losing our minds, because we're like, get the lid.  Get the fucking lid.  Because these things were so pissed off.  All I can picture is like, now they're completely loose in the studio in a small space.  Just pissed off looking to sting whatever they can find. 
[00:08:30]  I think they weren't stinging them at first, because as bees, they were looking up.  And they were probably looking at each other going, are these balls?  Like, is somebody putting their balls in here with us?  Because it can't be happening like that.  We have to have a meeting.  This can't be real.  To determine if those are really balls.  He put a nest on his balls and shook it to rile them up.  He jumped up and down to make a yellow jacket nest on his balls angry.  Way above and beyond the call.  Oh, I love that dude.  Let's go to Mike in Boston real fast.  Mike?  Gentlemen.  Hey.  Best ending in radio history. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I was relieved.  I was relieved it ended like that.  Congratulations.  That was phenomenal.  And by the way, nothing happened at that point, which is fine.  We were able to get the lid on the jar without him panicking.  Yeah, not one bee got out into this studio, which is amazing.  Amazing.  With all those bees, not one bee got out.  So escape.  I was on my way to the Islander Ranger game at the Coliseum.  I listened to the show yesterday three times.  I rarely listen to the replays, because I don't want to critique myself, the show in general. 
[00:09:30]  Yes, I should have said that.  Why didn't we do this?  That's right.  But there are times you can't help yourself.  Yeah.  I listened three times, and on the way to the Islander Ranger game, I got to the Coliseum  right as the show ended.  And I was taken out of our own show, because I'm like, what happened?  I was starting to think, what happened?  Because all of a sudden, the show just ended and went into commercials or whatever.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like, oh, yeah, I know what happened.  I was there.  Duh.  Yeah, I kind of remember. 
[00:10:00]  Oops.  Yeah, what a spectacle.  Listen to this one.  Carl in Philly.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  The end of that show sounded, if you play it back, you're all yelling, cover, cover,  where's cover?  It sounded like an ambush in Vietnam.  We're all screaming.  Just screaming and losing our minds.  Get the cover.  Where's the cover?  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Yeah.  Hey.  You guys got to play that ending again.  I missed it, man.  You got to play it one more time. 
[00:10:30]  We will.  30 seconds.  Honestly, it just ended, the replay, so most people that are listening right now heard  what we're talking about.  A little later in the show, I promise, we'll do the highlights of yesterday's show, because  later in the show, it'll be a whole different audience that probably didn't hear the ending  and all that.  We sat in our car for like an hour listening to that last night.  It was unbelievable.  Awesome.  I got to tell you, it was an unbelievable show yesterday.  Couldn't leave the show.  Anyone I talked to was like, just couldn't tune away.  One of those shows, Opie. 
[00:11:00]  One of those shows.  Those guys were fucking, every one of them, I can't get over the fact they would put their  balls where there's bees.  I wouldn't put my hand.  No.  Or anything.  In a fist.  Yeah, in a fist.  I wouldn't put my hand near one bee where there's a possibility that it could sting me.  Especially.  And they are putting their bag.  Especially that jar at the end.  Yeah.  That jar looked just very scary.  It's a jar of nasty, angry bees.  They've never had anyone do that.  They broke off a bigger nest, so they're like, what the fuck? 
[00:11:30]  Someone's going to pay for this.  They were like in that awful, awful when they're curled up sleeping.  There's something really even more disturbing about bees when they're sleeping.  I don't know.  When they're curled up and they're just not moving, there's something really uncomfortable  about that, because you just know the potential for awful.  Yep.  And they just hit his balls and explode.  Oh.  Really bad.  All right.  Let's go to Evil Trucker in Dallas.  Evil Trucker.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Also known as Max.  At the end of your show, I had visions of that movie, Killer Bees, Deadly Swarm. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, what a great movie.  All those bees are all over those fucking people, and they're laying there dead, and bees are  crawling out of their nose, and they got warts all over their face where they got stung.  Yeah.  I had Jimmy laying there with one shoe askew.  Like, my trousers down, the bees just raping me.  I got to tell you, the show was done perfectly, because not one bee flew around their studio.  Nope.  You guys are bona fide beekeepers.  You rock.  Take it easy. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Oh, the photoshops on Wackbag have been hysterical, too.  Me and Jimmy in the...  Well, here's an instant feedback from Derby Dave in Canada.  Welcome, Canada.  Holy fuck, I watched the Matt vs. the Bees video.  It wasn't Matt that made me laugh so hard, but Jimmy and Anthony's bee suits, what a couple  of faggots.  And that's a Canadian.  You guys did look ridiculous. 
[00:13:00]  We really did.  Yeah.  You looked really silly.  There was a Photoshop called Brokeback Beekeepers, me and you, hugging each other with our beekeeper  hats on.  Sparrow, man.  Some really funny ones.  That's really funny.  And what happened to Tracy Morgan yesterday?  I don't know.  A lot of controversy.  We had so many unanswered questions.  Some loose ends from yesterday.  Loose ends that we got to wrap up today.  Controversy that went into the night with emails and everything.  It sure did.  There's another Photoshop of me and Jimmy in our beekeeper outfits, sitting at a desk 
[00:13:30]  with bees all around, and Opie without the beekeeper outfit, covered in welts and bee  stings.  Very good job from Freaks 8, I guess that is.  Yeah, that's excellent.  That's excellent.  But we lost Tracy Morgan yesterday.  Yeah, for some reason, Tracy came in, he was dressed in the bee suit, looked like he  wanted to completely participate in Super Bowl 1.  Right.  And he was sitting there, kind of dug it, and then he was gone out of nowhere. 
[00:14:00]  No goodbye.  No, guys, I got to leave.  I'm tired.  This, that.  Nothing.  Just gone.  That's how I saw it.  So I'm thinking maybe he got a phone call from his people saying, you know, maybe you  shouldn't be in this atmosphere or something.  And then, thank God.  Thank God Travis set me straight.  What did Travis say?  Well, he said, well, Tracy came into the production studio and he was laughing and having a great 
[00:14:30]  time.  So apparently, I'm just a complete fucking moron that knows nothing.  And Travis, thank God, is so enlightened and so perceptive to everything that he filled  me in and let me know that all was fine with Tracy Morgan.  So basically, Travis was saying that you're an ill-informed ass who didn't know what was  going on.  Not even in so many words.  Yes, he said that exactly.  Well, where is he to come in here and just tell you, Ant, you're an ass?  Oh, I don't know.  He doesn't want to take that chance. 
[00:15:00]  Of course he doesn't.  I got to say, though, Tracy.  Tough guy behind a keyboard, aren't you?  Tough guy.  I can't picture Tracy ever listening to his people.  No, no.  Tracy put on a jock in front of 6,000 people.  Yeah, well, that's why.  He really doesn't give a shit.  There's a picture from Steve Thrower, Brokeback Beekeepers.  Look at us.  That's on Wackbag.  Back at Beekeepers.  Well, we'll get Tracy to figure out how to get our cocks through those screens.  Jesus.  I can't quit.  I got stung. 
[00:15:30]  Put some honey on it.  And supposedly Tracy's not coming in today, so something's going on.  Yeah, what happened?  Because now there was an excuse.  Ben said that he's tired.  He had late shows yesterday at Caroline's.  Usually there's only one show on a Thursday night.  Probably, yeah.  So I don't know what the hell's going on.  We just need an answer.  We think that he saw the bees and it really scared the shit out of him.  Because I don't think you get to see bees in the hood.  I don't think you get to see many bees in the hood, so it's probably overwhelming.  They're always around big trash cans full of Italian ices. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure he has no problem seeing rats.  But when it comes to bees.  I was going to say, it's such a used thing.  What?  But they do like bees like watermelon when it's around.  But that's kind of a racist thing to say.  No, no.  Why would that be considered racist?  I don't know.  I think in days of old, it was kind of set up.  I can't picture Tracy getting mad at the show, though, for something like that.  No, I can't either.  That's what it is.  He loves the show.  We need an answer, though, because all of a sudden he just left.  He might have left.  And then he hung out out there for a little while, so it was something he was bothered 
[00:16:30]  by in the studio, so we're thinking bees.  Bees.  And then he finally left for good.  And he never gave a good answer to anybody around.  Let me guess.  He probably went, man, they're doing Middle East.  It was a hectic show.  I'm guessing he might have just went, look, I'll talk to those guys tomorrow.  It's crazy.  You think?  No.  Here's Devil's Advocate.  I'm not trashing him, but there's got to be something else.  Because that type of show was perfect for him.  He's been in here when there's been crazy stuff going on.  I will throw out some things that I don't believe are true, but I'll throw them out there 
[00:17:00]  for that.  Perhaps he felt he wasn't going to get as many plugs during a show like that.  No.  All right.  Not Tracy's Vine.  I know.  You're really good at plugging.  I know.  But even the first thing he said when he got anything to plug, he goes, nah, man.  And he was so into the contest.  He was laughing his ass off.  He had the beatkeeper suit on.  But he was out of here before the bees even really came into the picture.  He might have seen that jar full of them, dude.  That jar full of them might have come out.  It was pretty creepy just looking at the jars filled with bees.  Yeah, it was.  And our apparatus wasn't like it was solid. 
[00:17:30]  But he had a beekeeper suit on, too.  That apparatus looked like it was going to break any moment.  It looked like the bees were trying to figure out how to open that damn thing.  He was dressed like a 60-year-old white man.  He can't be seen like that.  He's in the ghetto.  You're going to ruin his image in that beekeeper suit?  Fucking dressed like Peter Fonda in Uli's Gold.  Yeah.  Well, we still love Tracy Morgan.  He's playing Caroline's all weekend long.  Maybe we'll get him in here or on the phone to explain.  At least on the phone to get an answer.  Because as I explained in my much criticized and critiqued email last night, no one has 
[00:18:00]  ever just left the studio without saying anything to us unless they were completely disgusted  and or completely pissed off at us.  Yeah.  We had, what's his name?  The guy that made the sound effects for Police Academy.  Michael Winslow.  Michael Winslow left without uttering a peep.  This is a guy who, you know, makes sound effects as his career could not utter a peep.  He just got up and walked out.  That was during one of our Sex for Sams.  Yes. 
[00:18:30]  I believe there were points for having sex in front of a celebrity.  He was there.  So all the couples wanted to get the easy points and just started ass-fucking each other  right in front of him.  He, apparently we didn't know, was a born-again Christian and fled the scene before he turns  into a pillar of salt.  Making sound effects as he's running down the hall in a panic.  I think he went, made the sound of him busting through a wall.  It was kind of funny, but he was gone.  And then other people just leave.  A lot of callers just hang up on us out of nowhere. 
[00:19:00]  They punch out, leave the show.  That's kind of the impression I got from Tracy, but...  That actress from Dog Sees God, Ari, she was cool.  She was a trooper.  She was definitely a trooper.  She hung in there.  She hung in there until she realized the bees were coming and then she wanted out too.  Yeah, but I understand that without the beekeeper suit on.  Sure.  All right.  Well, the phones are just, they are just out of control.  Going nutty?  I was going to say just out of control today.  Billy in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boy? 
[00:19:30]  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Dude, I listened to that replay probably for the third time this morning.  Yeah.  Fucking tears coming out of my eyes.  It was unbelievable.  Fucking hilarious.  And this is our problem.  We have to beat that show now.  See, this is the slippery slope we get on with this program.  You guys should have just called in the show this morning and just played the last...  Oh, don't worry.  We will.  Wow, we certainly will.  Not only did we have a great show yesterday,  today's Friday.  Yep.  It's a double whammy for us giving you nothing. 
[00:20:00]  Well, we're supposed to do American Mess today,  but we didn't get to promote it too well this week except for some promos,  so I don't know if anyone's going to show up for the open call.  I hope so.  American Mess, just bring back the guy's ball bags.  Yeah, they have to really be hurting today.  Yeah, I can't wait to hear from them today.  How are you going to top this next year?  I don't know.  But like Anthony said, Super Bowl won.  That means there will be a second one.  Oh, of course.  And I got to thank the gang down in...  Got to at least get three in before we get fired from it.  Well, I got to thank the gang down in D.C. 
[00:20:30]  for figuring out a way to allow us to do something  instead of figuring out why we shouldn't.  Yeah.  That was our problem in the old place.  I liked everybody patting each other on the back after,  like right after the show,  saying, hey, it worked, everything's fine,  before we even gave the allergic reaction  a chance to start on the guys.  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks just yet, gentlemen.  I don't think we're at a...  I know that one.  Yeah, it was Pulp Fiction. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  But everybody's like, you know, hey, that went great.  Hey, this guy could still die.  All right?  They had cops and ambulance out front.  The EMTs were dragging the contestants  to Ron and Fez's office to check their ball bags.  Check their ball bags.  They had to put on their gloves and examine by hand  every contestant's ball bag.  Are they listening?  Because I want to see how many stings they found.  Fez tried to steal an EMT uniform  just to get in there and do some examining.  Do some barehanded.  He wasn't wearing any gloves either.  We've got to get the EMTs on the phone. 
[00:21:30]  I want to see how many bites and stings they discovered.  You know what I liked?  Walking out of the building yesterday,  the EMTs had the stretcher in the hallway,  and it was loaded with free XM stuff.  There were, like, boombox units  and all kinds of swag on it,  and they're wheeling that down  right into the back of the ambulance.  I saw the three contestants outside,  I mean, Raphael and the two dudes,  they were all, like, fine at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Hey, we have one.  They administered some salve. 
[00:22:00]  We only have, what, two clips up  on opianthony.com right now?  Yep.  All right, Steve's got so much footage to go through.  He's got eight hours of footage  because it was a two-camera shoot,  so he's got to go through one guy's camera  and then the next guy's.  Lots of it.  Should be edited nicely,  and then I guess Steve's getting a new server  because a lot of people bitching  that some of the quality and speed  from Foundry music might be a little subpar.  Well, bear with us  because there's going to be a lot of video  as the weekend unfolds here.  Sometimes you download something from Foundry 
[00:22:30]  and you have to stand 10 feet back  to make up what it is.  You look, go,  it's five or six pixels,  and I got to squint.  It's not bad.  But there's a bandwidth problem.  Wait, is that what happens?  Like, when you download something,  it's not clear?  Is it because there's not enough bandwidth?  They have to compress them down so much  and make the file smaller,  and when you do that, you lose quality.  Okay.  Let's go to Chris in Texas.  Chris!  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, man.  Hey, I just want to let you guys know 
[00:23:00]  I'm a new listener to Open Anthony.  I've had XM for a while.  Welcome.  Man, this shit is so funny.  Thank you, Chris.  He enjoys the program.  I just wanted to tell you guys  it's fucking working out well.  I'm trying to spread the virus,  and little Jimmy, we love you.  Thank you, sweetie.  Boring.  And they love little Jimmy.  Thank you, Chris.  Let's go to Julian in Maine.  Julian!  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Julian. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, I was wondering,  who was the big winner  of the amazing Super Bowl, anyway?  The Open Anthony radio show.  That's right.  Yeah.  No doubt.  Was there even a winner?  Yeah, we won.  I mean, yeah, we won.  Because we're spreading the virus.  More subscribers means more money for us.  More money means more fame and more blowjobs.  Who had the most mousetraps?  Getting a shit.  Yeah.  Huh?  Who had the most mousetraps?  Matt.  With six.  Matt.  Matt.  Who had the wasp's nest against his ball back? 
[00:24:00]  Matt.  See, I...  Matt had a huge comeback.  Yeah, I think Matt was the winner.  Matt is still the champion.  Yeah.  What a chump one.  My only thing, though, is those guys,  and you got to say for Rafael,  was the guy Steven?  Yeah, I think so.  Those guys would have done anything, too.  Like, they just did what they were given.  One guy did put his balls over two fucking wasps,  one of which stung him,  and the other guy put him over, like,  frickin' 60 honeybees.  Mm-hmm.  You know, so those guys were just animals.  Yeah, they were all great, 
[00:24:30]  but Matt, I mean,  he tipped the jar with the nest in it  right on his ball back.  Yeah, he wasn't happy with just his balls  hanging in with the wasps.  He wanted those things right up against it  and leaned back.  Yeah.  We should have, next year,  we make him put the whole junk in there.  I bet they're all having a rough one this morning, though.  Yeah, we'll hear from them a little later.  Yeah.  The whole fucking hog,  and we have a fucking...  I think next year it should just be a big jar  with two hornets in it.  I think next year we bring this out  to the public somehow, some way. 
[00:25:00]  Where?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why?  Maybe we could build some kind of glass booth  or something.  No.  Once we leave the compound,  that's when we get in trouble.  We are bringing it to the public.  Super Bowl II next year.  No.  On the road like the Super Bowl,  we pick a city.  That's right.  They have all year to promote the fact  that they're going to host the games.  That's right.  And then, uh...  Or like the Olympics.  Yeah, we could...  We need to still start building a glass booth.  Have cities come to us.  All right, let's go to Thomas  in South Carolina.  Thomas?  Hey, good morning, fellas. 
[00:25:30]  Hey.  I wish I knew how to quit, y'all.  All I can say is I woke up this morning,  about two in the morning,  and this nightmare that these fucking wasps  all over my nuts,  and I actually woke up with nut pain.  I think what must have happened is  the hand, you know,  the subliminal hand got down there  and tried to swap these things away,  but I actually woke up  with fucking nut pain this morning.  I want y'all to know that,  and thank you very much.  Hopefully it's only a lump.  Yeah.  A lot of people had sympathy pains,  they said.  They were listening  and were actually feeling ball pain 
[00:26:00]  just from the thought and the sounds.  Well, we'll have some highlights  from yesterday's show  a little later on today.  We got lots to do.  And that was just the grand finale  we were talking about with the bees,  but earlier on,  I listened on the way in  and I caught the mousetrap segment,  and that was amazing.  That was just hilarious.  What a way to warm up  for the grand finale  because we expected the guys  to just lay their sack  in the mousetrap  and snap one on  and then move on  to the next event.  But these guys really stepped up  and tried to get more 
[00:26:30]  and more mousetraps  on their nutsack.  The record was set at six,  almost seven,  very close.  Seven was snapped on,  but the refs reviewed.  He did not have control  of the seventh trap  for long enough,  so he had to just go with six.  But I think next year  we're going to see seven,  maybe even eight traps.  I will say ten.  Ten.  Well, he ran out of skin.  That was his only problem.  That wasn't his main issue, yeah.  It's all about placement.  If we promote this,  you're going to have  some dude come in  that has a ridiculous  fucking stretch out sack. 
[00:27:00]  It's like an athlete.  Basketball players  have to be tall.  If you want to excel at this,  you need a big bag.  If we do this next year  and promote it,  some 80-year-old guy  is coming in here  with his ball bag.  The trap's already on it.  Maybe they won't even  know about it.  There'll be just dozens  on the damn thing.  We should bring Ben in here  because I was talking  to Ben yesterday.  He made me laugh  so freaking hard  because you know  when I broke that jar  in studio,  I didn't tell anyone.  Yeah.  I was setting you guys  up for a little gag.  You scared the shit  out of me.  And I think you guys 
[00:27:30]  legitimately were freaked out.  Yep.  I heard that Steve  really lost it  and ran out of the studio  trying to find Danny  to protect him  because I lost my mind.  He's like,  we're all going to get fired.  Where's Danny?  Grab Danny  and get him protected.  Like a Secret Service guy  with the president.  Well,  because Danny,  I guess,  is the guy  that's really allergic  to bees around here.  So he says.  And I called  as many people in  as possible  because I knew  I was going to  break that jar  and see what kind  of reaction I could get.  When I said,  let the games begin,  I smashed a jar. 
[00:28:00]  There was nothing  in the jar,  but you guys didn't know  that at the time.  No, I didn't either.  And Steve,  you really thought  there was something  in the jar.  Well, I saw  what was a piece of glass  that flipped up  and must have caught  the light  because it looked  like a bee  flying out of the jar.  I saw Ant and Jim react  and I went,  oh, what the fuck  did he just do?  And that's when I was like,  if there's a bee loose  in the studio,  I got to make sure  that Danny's in the other room.  We got to protect  our phony baloney jobs,  gentlemen.  Exactly.  Well, that's what  the bear does.  He protects the cub.  Oh, is that what  he was doing? 
[00:28:30]  I've seen that.  The bear protects the cub.  On Animal Planet,  they do that.  When they see a cub  in danger,  they just like growl.  Grr.  Yeah, that's it.  Grr.  Look how angry he was.  Grr.  And then when Danny  wanted to run  into the studio,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  See?  That is a bear  protecting a cub.  He just took Dan  and threw him  in the other room  and then laid on top of him  until the bee threat  was gone.  All night long.  Yes.  Just spooning.  Keeping Dan's backside safe.  We went into a panic, 
[00:29:00]  didn't you?  We were told by DC  to keep the guys  that are allergic  if there were any  in that production studio  because at least  there's a nice seal  on the door.  Yeah.  So we just wanted  to make sure.  Danny wanted to come out  and check everything out.  So what's the deal  with the video?  It's going to take you  all weekend, isn't it?  Yeah, it'll take the weekend.  I mean, John's doing some of it,  I'm doing some of it  because there's just a lot.  Right.  And there's what?  Two clips up right now?  Two clips up now  and in the 15 seconds  it took me to put one up  and then check to make sure  it was up there,  it got hit 50 times.  So, I mean,  it's already up to 4,000  this morning, I think.  4,000 hits on the early clips?  It might be more, yeah.  Holy crap. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, so we got two little clips  so far on opianthony.com.  This is going to be what?  I don't even know.  At least 10 or 12 maybe?  Probably.  Your ship went over to FARC.  Drew does not want to have  anything to do  with the testicle clips.  Oh, testicle clips?  Yeah, he doesn't want it.  I've talked to him.  What about the B clip?  No.  No.  Wow.  No, I've talked to him.  He's cool with it.  It's just certain content.  All right, we'll find  some other websites then.  Oh, yeah, no,  there's a couple of them.  Gorilla Mask picked up on it,  Faze picked up on it,  and a few others.  Why?  Because it's naked?  Yeah, a lot of it.  Yeah, they don't do a lot of it.  They don't do nudity?  Yeah, Drew was like, 
[00:30:00]  I'll pass on this one.  And the Jimmy Robinson thing  downloaded over a million times?  Oh, yeah.  How is that possible?  Well, Newgrounds,  the site that it's on,  that Jimmy Robinson clip  got hit.  They get a lot of traffic.  They get way, way more.  They're up around  MTV's level of traffic.  Jesus.  And that Jimmy Robinson  animation that went up there  with the little girl  taking a dump on your chest  got hit one million times  as of Wednesday, I think.  That's unbelievable.  There you go.  It's a great piece of animation.  I love that.  It went platinum.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Me and Dan are doing  some gigs together. 
[00:30:30]  That bastard,  Dane sold out.  He's doing an HBO special.  Yeah.  In the round,  in the,  you want to talk about  wanting to kill yourself  as a comic,  knowing someone you know  is doing good.  He's doing it in the round  in the,  I think the Fleet Center  in Boston,  17,000 seats.  He sold it in the pre-sale.  He sold out two days.  Before it was on sale,  his fucking mailing list.  It was the fastest pre-sale  in the history  of that shitty venue.  17,000 seats in two days.  So what else does he do?  He adds a second show,  which sold out.  And I think he's working 
[00:31:00]  on a third.  Wow.  In the fucking Fleet Center.  That's like Andrew Dice Clay  numbers from when  Dice was doing his thing.  No,  I mean,  Ope's right,  but not bigger than Dice.  Dice,  well,  no,  and I'm not shitting on Dane.  Dice sold 42 minutes  I think he sold the Continental Arena in.  But again,  that was a different,  Dice had an HBO special,  one hour thing.  Dane is kind of backdooring it  in a really weird way  with all these fans.  But the impressive thing  is not that Dane  is doing those gigs.  It's that I'm doing Albany.  Right. 
[00:31:30]  Do you understand  how hard it is  to get psyched for all?  My Saturday show  is sold out  and I'm kind of proud of myself.  Like,  yeah,  it's three weeks in advance.  This fucker sold 17,000 seats  in two days.  He's a promotion machine  is what he is.  That's great.  Good for him.  He found a niche  on that MySpace,  which is making the news today.  Did you hear about that one?  No, what?  A lot of people calling it  a just breeding ground  for pedophile predators.  Of course.  What else is it for?  So they are finding  underage boys and girls 
[00:32:00]  with their cell phone numbers  on here,  personal information,  lots of photographs  of them and their friends  and it is just  a breeding ground.  Where are they finding this?  I want exact addresses.  I've gotten friend requests  from many youngsters.  They send a friend request.  Be my friend.  You know,  Mary,  16. 
[00:32:30]  And,  you know,  I want to be nice.  I just don't want to say  that they're my friend.  So I agree  to meet them  at a 7-Eleven.  Because I think  true friendship  isn't just clicking  something on a computer.  That's fucking hilarious.  That's my defense  and I'm sticking with it.  There you go.  How do you not love  those guys,  the excuses they make?  Oh, I know.  I just want to make sure  he was okay.  You know,  our email correspondence,  he sounded very troubled.  Yeah,  I was concerned for him.  And I thought I'd meet him  behind the dumpster 
[00:33:00]  and a blowjob  is a good,  how do you do?  He doesn't have a good  relationship with his parents.  I thought I'd fuck his mouth.  Thank you, Steve.  So Steve will get the clips up  on opianthony.com,  foundyourmusic.com.  And there's talks about a DVD.  Yes, there are talks.  A DVD of all the crazy stuff  that has happened  in this studio  since coming to XM.  It would be sold, right?  Not given away, sold?  Sold.  Attaboy.  Of course. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, Don.  Don sent an email yesterday  that just amazed me.  He's like,  guys,  why don't we release  yesterday's show on DVD?  The entire B show on DVD.  Because he's like,  well,  if 700 plus people  checked it out  on Pal Talk alone,  can you imagine  how many people  would buy a DVD like that  immediately?  And we should get on it  immediately because it's hot.  And then he goes,  and then opianthony  can take all the money  raised and give it  to their favorite charity.  Yes.  And I wrote back, 
[00:34:00]  Don,  on this one,  Ant and I,  and the rest of the gang  want some bling.  That's right.  We're charitable.  Proceeds will go  to the Anthony Mortgage Fund.  That's right.  Sons of bitches.  What a silly goose.  Can't we sell out  a little bit?  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah,  we're going to put out  a DVD that's going to  sell hundreds of thousands  of copies,  and we're going to  hand over a big check  to some charity  that doesn't give a shit  about us.  Who cares?  No!  That doesn't even  acknowledge where the 
[00:34:30]  money came from  because it's such an  embarrassment?  Yeah.  No.  Hey guys,  don't forget,  that's what I'm  practicing for when  the DVD comes out.  Yeah.  You get the brand  new DVD.  We got a great name  for it and everything.  Don't you want to say it?  Nope.  Because someone else  will maybe take it.  But we have a great  name for the DVD.  I already know the name.  It's Jim Norton Presents.  And we'll be,  Thanks for blowing that one.  Now it can't be.  And just so you know,  we'll be charitable  with something else  down the road,  but not with a  Opie and Anthony DVD  of all the crazy shit  that happens in the studio.  We're charitable enough here.  We were thinking of 
[00:35:00]  waiting until next Christmas,  but we might have  enough stuff to maybe  get something out in the,  I don't know,  the summer.  Yeah.  We got to think this over.  Yeah, we'll look through  our...  You have years of stuff,  right?  Tapes.  We have years of stuff,  but we don't know  who owns that material still.  Ooh, let's record it  over again.  Because Steve was...  Yeah, really.  Because Steve was filming  that on his own time,  so I think Steve owns it.  I think Steve is the mogul here.  Uh-oh.  With that old video.  We're going to have  to work him over.  We're going to have  to negotiate with Steve.  I think we just steal it  like he's some kind  of black jazz artist. 
[00:35:30]  Steve has thousands  of hours of crazy video  from the old place.  Yeah.  Thousands of hours.  Yep.  I was once over his house.  He has a whole file cabinet  just filled with those  tiny little video tapes.  And pornography.  Just filled, though.  You know who Steve is?  He's a filth bag.  Yes, he is.  Steve's a dirty boy.  I love him.  All right, let's say hi to John,  one of the EMTs from yesterday.  John?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, John.  What's up?  Hi.  Not a whole lot.  Not a whole lot.  Ironically, I get a phone call 
[00:36:00]  this morning summoning me  to the office.  So when we're all unemployed,  remember me.  Oh, you might get in trouble?  No.  No, you'll be all right.  So, uh...  That was all good.  So what can we do for you today?  I don't really care  if you have a job or not.  I really need to know  if these guys got their  ball bags beat up  pretty good yesterday.  Yeah, they did.  That was a whole lot  of heinous stupidity,  in my opinion.  And you guys had to count up  bee stings and stuff?  Yeah, I had.  That was a highlight  on a resume.  And what did you do?  Well, for the O&A show, 
[00:36:30]  I got to inspect  someone's yam bag  for bee stings.  Did you have to pull up  his scrotum  to check the underside?  No, see,  I had two underlings for that.  I didn't go anywhere  near anybody's hairy nuts.  Thank you very much.  Is it safe to say  these guys got stung  pretty good?  Yes.  Yes.  Multiple times?  Multiple stings and bites.  Multiple stings and bites.  Yeah, because I was  with one of my brothers  at the game last night  and he goes,  how do you know  they were stinging  and not biting?  Yeah.  I'm like,  they were stinging.  Yeah, the way he reacted,  Matt reacted 
[00:37:00]  when they finally  stung him.  Yeah.  Oh, priceless.  It was not the benefit  of radio  to watch this guy's eyes  jump out of his head,  him leap 10 feet in the air  and almost drop the jar.  Yep.  Outstanding.  I really thought  he was just going to  drop the jar  and start running,  leaving all those bees  to just escape.  I know,  I'm watching a bunch  of faggots run around  when my friend Ant  and I just stood there  and laughed and laughed.  In our bee protective suits.  Ah, boy.  Thanks a lot.  Hey,  didn't Jimmy tell you guys  to stay close to him  yesterday? 
[00:37:30]  Who else in the studio  was allergic?  Which one of your  actual staff?  Were you allergic?  No.  I don't know.  I haven't been stung  since I was eight years old.  I didn't say stay close.  I had my suit on.  There's rumors going around  that you told the EMT guys  to stay close to you.  Who started that, Ben?  Yeah.  Of course.  It was like,  stay close.  Here's Ben.  Ben.  No, I didn't.  Because you made me laugh  so hard last night  with that one.  I will tell you.  Go ahead, Ben.  You weren't scared 
[00:38:00]  of the bees yesterday?  Terrified of the bees,  but I didn't tell those  guys to stay close.  I wasn't nervous  about them getting out  because I had a beekeeper suit.  I mean, I'm like,  that's stupid.  I mean,  I have a beekeeper suit,  I'll step on the little fuckers.  Completely ridiculous.  All right.  Like a giant tampon  with no courage.  John,  John,  thanks again.  Hey,  anytime, guys.  Thanks so much.  All right,  one of the EMT guys  from yesterday.  Danny threw something  together really fast.  It has something to do  with the bee program  we did yesterday  and another,  and it has something to do  with one of the new bits  we're doing  that we got from Craig Ferguson.  Don't want to take credit  for this, 
[00:38:30]  the drunken bit.  Yeah.  I heard that on the replay yesterday.  That's got to be  one of the funniest things  I've heard us do.  I love it.  It's simple.  It's so ridiculously simple.  Yeah.  All you do is slow down audio  just a little bit,  and if you do it just right,  the person sounds really drunk.  Sounds completely hammered.  And Danny threw one together.  It's just Anthony  talking about the bees.  All right.  This was from yesterday's show  very early on  when we were just kind of  talking about what's going on,  okay?  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Anthony, slow down  to sound drunk. 
[00:39:00]  It's like this show.  Like, we're not quite sure  what's legal or not,  but as long as somebody  at corporate says,  okay, we go along,  and before you know it,  there's a yam bag  hanging in a jar full of bees.  God, it's so simple.  I know. 
[00:39:30]  It's so effective.  It's almost embarrassing  how easy that is.  We like to challenge ourselves.  It's like, oh,  all we had to do  was slow down audio  to make people laugh?  How did we miss that?  How did we miss that?  Before somebody else did it.  I know,  and that's what's frustrating, too.  The genius that came up  with that at the Ferguson show,  I'd love to know  what writer thought of that  or what was him.  That's great.  Brilliant.  Let's go to Gail in New York.  Gail, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Glad to see you guys  are on the air this morning.  We are, too.  Yeah.  You'll lift the God's ears, Gail.  Sounds like the Hindenburg disaster  yesterday afternoon  when you got cut off. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  Get out of the way.  My blood pressure  just listening to that yesterday  just went through the room.  Oh, I know.  Tasticularity.  What I learned yesterday,  many things,  but most of all,  get the contestants  in around 4 a.m. next time  and get all those depositions done  so we can listen to it.  I hope you guys understand  what these guys had to do  just to do that bee trick.  The paperwork,  the video confessions,  it was nuts.  Somebody was saying  on a message board  they think,  why didn't we bring the people  down the day before  to shoot the paperwork? 
[00:40:30]  But you have to realize,  it's hard to get people down here.  People have jobs and stuff  and they're not going to just  come in and sign stuff  and then leave and come back.  If we get them here once,  you've got to keep them here  and have them do  what you've got to do.  And you know what?  It didn't matter  because I was thinking,  listening to a replay yesterday,  I'm like,  the first couple hours of the show  had to be boring  because they were sitting around  waiting for these guys  to get all the paperwork done.  It wasn't boring at all.  I was very entertained  by yesterday's show.  And then we had  the grand finale.  It was a perfect show.  I was thinking last night  how difficult  that would have been 
[00:41:00]  to do on regular radio.  Impossible.  It was five years in the making.  We wanted to do that  when we were on regular radio.  Impossible.  You could have your free fucking FM.  You know what?  Because you ain't getting that shit.  We would have been able to do it,  but I was just thinking  of how difficult  it would have been  to sit there and go,  all right,  take your stuff.  No, no, Anthony.  And do the...  Well, you don't understand.  I mean, you do understand this,  but that's how we used to do things,  but you can't even do it  that way anymore.  No, I don't mean now.  I mean even then. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Back then, like when we...  But now it's not even a possibility  because you can't even talk around it.  No way.  Uh-uh.  See, we don't even know  the rules of free radio anymore.  Free man.  Because they've gotten so ridiculous.  We used to study it.  Yep.  On a daily basis  so we could do what we used to do.  But now I have no idea.  I think...  No, it wouldn't even happen.  Because you couldn't even elude...  So vague.  You couldn't even be vague  about what they were putting in the jar.  Right.  It would have been a waste of time. 
[00:42:00]  Free FM.  Let's go to Eric in Salem.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Eric?  Hey, just wanted to let you know  I've never really fucking called  on a radio station before,  but I just got XM  about two or three days ago.  A friend of mine said  I had to listen to your show yesterday  about the whole Super Bowl.  Fucking had to tune in.  I was working all day  tuning in at the midnight replay  over here on the West Coast.  I just couldn't stop laughing.  That was just the greatest show  I have ever heard,  and I just wanted to say  you got a listener for life. 
[00:42:30]  You guys fucking rock.  Look at that.  One day.  Yeah, but don't expect anything  from us for at least a month now, man.  I don't care.  You watch how we ride this one out.  Anything you guys say or do,  I'm going to love,  and I'm going to definitely tell  every single person I know  to sign up.  Thank you.  That's why we call it a virus.  Yes.  Exactly.  And that's your job  to spread the virus for us.  Of course.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, thank you.  All right, let's talk to Ann  in Minnesota.  Ann.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hello.  Before I comment on Super Bowl, 
[00:43:00]  I got to tell you guys,  now when you do that DVD thing,  make sure you package it up  like Voss  with just a black label  and white writing  so people can see it.  And an awful tissue paper insert.  Right.  I got to tell you  what I learned about myself yesterday.  I am a sick fuck.  I drive a school bus.  I go,  I couldn't leave your show.  I, like, jump.  I had to.  I jump on my bus,  pick up all the little Catholic girls,  drop them off,  drive my bus back  to where my car is,  jump in my car,  listen to you guys.  Then I got to go pick up 
[00:43:30]  the little elementary kids,  jump back in my bus,  and I'm like,  get your asses on the bus.  Come on, let's go,  let's go, let's go.  I'm hurrying them up  because I had to hear Super Bowl.  I had to get back here.  She lost me  at Catholic school girls.  No, she was just excited.  It was one of those shows  you had to just, you know,  I was doing the same thing.  I was checking on  my brother's restaurant yesterday.  I'm like, fuck my brother.  I got to listen to the replay.  Jumping back in my,  I totally related  to what she just was saying.  Yeah.  As boring as it sounded,  but I was like.  Oh, thanks, guys.  Dude, I decided to be late 
[00:44:00]  for the Islander Ranger game  because I knew, you know,  our show ends at seven  and that's when they dropped the puck.  I'm like, fuck that.  I got to hear how that crazy ending ended.  So I was completely influenced yesterday.  Speaking of bus drivers,  we should take a break  and get into the tiny goon squad  that's in the paper today.  This guy's a class act.  We have to start that hall of shame,  hall of fame,  whatever it is.  Yeah.  We got to come up with a name  that we only, you know,  put special people in.  This guy fits the bill.  Because the dude with the poop 
[00:44:30]  on the girl's hair.  I'm going to guess Joel Krupnick  was his name?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Joel Krupnick.  Maybe we call it the Joel Krupnick  award or something.  Yeah.  There's got to be something  with dignity  as Mr. Krupnick well deserves.  We got to figure it out  because there's something there  because there are these guys  that make the paper  here in New York especially.  They're just class acts.  There's this bus driver  that was bored  so he started a whole  goon squad  with the people  he drove around  from the school.  Nothing new though.  Yeah.  I guess we'll have some stories  that come out of the woodwork.  Bus drivers through the years  there's been quite a few 
[00:45:00]  winners out there.  Yeah.  All right.  Well we'll take a break  and we'll continue  with the Opie and Anthony program.  All right.  This is the Opie and Anthony program.  We have open call  for American Mess today  but I don't know  if it's going to happen.  I'll be honest with you.  The weather's real lousy.  We didn't give it  a big enough push I think.  For some reason  you really, really got to push.  Yep.  To get things to happen  when you do a radio show.  You can't just run a promo  and assume that's going to  make a hundred thousand  people show up. 
[00:45:30]  No.  No.  You got to like mention  every minute of the show.  Pound it into people's heads.  Just promote the hell  out of it.  Yeah.  But you never know.  We're looking for more  more freaks for the radio program  and new freaks.  We had gold last week.  We really did  with Scoliope  and Neo.  Yeah.  Yeah definitely.  Neo and Scoliope.  And we're looking for others  to show up.  Supposedly there was a guy  in St. Louis  that was bringing his buddy  that has no arms  and drinks beers  with his feet and stuff.  Yeah that I want to see.  But Gavin has entered the studio. 
[00:46:00]  Gavin.  Hello man.  Gavin is coming by  and Patrice is coming by  because we thought  we were doing American Mass  and no one's showing up Gavin.  Really?  So don't worry  we'll make you laugh  at some other things.  It's going to be hanging.  You fucking monster you.  You missed yesterday's show  with the bees bro.  What's that?  Oh you got to get an XM.  It was the greatest show  we've ever done.  Yesterday.  You missed the greatest show  we've ever done.  What was the slogan?  Well basically guys  put their ball bags  in jars filled with bees. 
[00:46:30]  Filled with bees.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That happened yesterday.  Actually we'll play some clips  for you a little later.  Thanks man.  In a little while actually.  Thanks a lot.  Alright.  Awesome.  And when's Patrice coming in?  I suppose he said  we'll be at 8 o'clock.  Yeah.  In Black Man's Time.  I saw him eating pizza  on The Office last night.  Yeah.  I guess they cut  all of his dialogue out.  He had two quick lines.  All he was doing  was eating pizza?  Yeah pretty much.  He had like a couple of  The Office?  He was in The Office?  The Office is the greatest show 
[00:47:00]  on TV right now.  Patrice was in The Office?  Yeah he's got like  some kind of semi-recurring role  as one of the warehouse guys.  They barely ever go down  to the warehouse  but when they do  there's Patrice down there  with the other black guys.  Oh he's been on more than one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh okay.  I taped yesterday's that  while I DVR'd it.  DVR.  That's what I did.  I watched three episodes  in a row.  Right.  In like you know  under an hour.  You could do that.  Fast forward through commercials.  Another reason Patrice  is coming in here  he wants to just destroy  Man Cow on this program today.  Yeah.  Yeah Man Cow. 
[00:47:30]  What happened?  Well Patrice does  Web Junk 20 for VH1.  Yeah.  So he had to do  one of those radio tours  where you sit in a room  and you do 20 stations  within an hour  or whatever it is.  Fun.  And he got to Man Cow.  Man Cow agreed to have him on  and then completely trashed him  and said something about  yeah video clubs great  and said something about  Jimmy Schubert.  Jimmy Schubert did that  or something.  What?  I don't know.  Patrice would get into the details.  I talked to him  when I was somewhere home.  And then just kind of  hung up on him.  Like was a real ass.  And then Patrice said that  pretty much all of radio 
[00:48:00]  hates this program.  Yeah.  Because they kept all hinting  hey Patrice this isn't  satellite radio you know.  Like just bitter  that he's successful  and he's on a successful show  helping out.  And the show is helping  you know sell out  comedy clubs  things like that  and meanwhile  their shitty radio shows  don't do anything.  And honestly  he doesn't give a shit.  What he does give a shit about  is the fact that  Man Cow  didn't even give him a chance.  Yeah.  Yeah just ambushed him.  It's like alright  you want to ambush me 
[00:48:30]  that's fine  but let me talk.  Patrice would bury him.  It's really hard  when you're on the phone  calling in  because you're like  what?  You're not in the vibe  it's really difficult man.  Phoners are brutal.  By the time you pick up  the ambush is even on  you can't ever  over talk the host  you can't ever  there's nothing you can do  it's really brutal  because all you gotta do  is turn you down  you volume down.  So it's gonna be fun  when Patrice gets in here  because he had me laughing  he wasn't pissed  he had me laughing hard  on the phone yesterday  when he called me  to tell me  what went on  with this radio tour  and he said 
[00:49:00]  everyone has the fake voices  the ha ha ha ha  tell us about  Web Chug 20.  So glad we are  out of that scene.  Oh no shit man.  God man.  Bill was there  and Bill Burr  was in studio right?  With Man Cow?  Wow really?  That must have been  a fun moment.  So we'll get to  the bottom of that  when Patrice gets here  in a few minutes I guess.  Just a real quick thing  I went to Huntington  yesterday  to check out  the old restaurant  FH Riders  on the register.  My brother is  officially serving food. 
[00:49:30]  Secretly dropping in  without announcing  yourself to keep  the staff in line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And one guy's like  hey I thought you said  you were seeing  the Ranger Islander game  here at the bar.  I'm like no idiot  I got tickets  I'm just stopping by  to have a bite of food  and then go to the game.  Yeah.  But he wasn't ready  to serve myself  because he was  starting up at 6 yesterday  and I had to get  to the Coliseum  for the Islander game.  Yeah.  They looked awful  last night again.  But so we went  to another restaurant  in Huntington  this is where  it gets pretty funny. 
[00:50:00]  I'm walking back  toward FH Riley's  400 New York Avenue  Huntington  and all of a sudden  I'm walking up  to the restaurant  and I see  all hell is breaking loose.  Not in front of the restaurant  but close enough  where I thought  oh what the fuck's going on.  Problem.  Is the kitchen on fire ready  because he's  you know  firing up those grills  and stuff for the first time  and I get closer  the police are there  fire department  sirens  lights  crazy right?  Yeah.  And we're walking up  the sidewalk  we get a little closer 
[00:50:30]  there's like an SUV  halfway up on the sidewalk  alright?  One of those big  heavy lampposts  they have in Huntington  completely gone  so the guy ran that over  and then a parking sign  not only ripped  from its moorings  moorings  it's through a window  a shop window  like some kind of  custard shop in Huntington  wow  so the front window  broken with this sign  in the middle of it  SUV on the sidewalk  huge lamppost  on the ground 
[00:51:00]  right?  We get closer  and there's a guy  in a stretcher  that they're loading  into an ambulance  right?  He's okay  but I guess they're gonna  bring him to the hospital  because it's such a  it was such an ugly  crash scene  I'm like what the hell  did this guy do?  Because especially  on New York Avenue  in Huntington there  you can't drive fast  so I don't know  what the fuck  a lot of traffic lights  yeah I don't know  how he could have  gotten enough speed  to do the damage  he was doing  and here's the punchline  so he's in the ambulance  and they're wheeling him in  all of a sudden  he turns to me  and goes 
[00:51:30]  hey there's Opie  everyone  now the crew's like  who's this fucking nut?  He's hallucinating  right  they think he's hallucinating  because they're like  you know  they're like what?  and they're looking my way  like that's not him  this guy obviously  he has a head injury  and the guy's like  no that's Opie  and they're slamming him  into the ambulance  did you even say hi?  yeah I was waving  to give him a good luck bro?  yeah I was like  I should have  I should have said  good luck bro  he said hey dude  you alright?  he's like yeah man  thumbs up  and I think the guy 
[00:52:00]  was in the restaurant  last weekend  when we opened up  oh I thought you were  going to say  no he wasn't there  last night  I swear to god  he wasn't there last night  drinking and then  plowing into something  I swear  I'm assuming that  maybe he was going  to the restaurant  to check it out  yeah  but he definitely  wasn't in there  because we were there  earlier and you know  there wasn't many people  at the bar  that would end up  keeping you in radio  about 10 years longer  than you want to be  no kidding  losing everything  you've worked for  so far  but it was just  a surreal you know  sight  the crash sight 
[00:52:30]  and then the guy's  going hey there's Opie  hey there's Opie  and no one believed  in him  it was pretty good  that's how you know  you're famous  when somebody spots you  and other people  don't believe it could be you  that's a good sign  that's a very famous guy  and people are like  that's not him  well because  and I'm not playing  into this  they turned around  like huh  and then looked  like I had a hat on  they're like oh my god  this guy obviously  has a head injury  we better hurry up  and get him to the hospital  hurry quick  this is the closest  I've ever come to that  hey that's Norton  yeah it is  no one else 
[00:53:00]  could look like him  no one's ever surprised  nor do they care  let's go to Petey in New York  Petey  yo guys  hey Petey  Opie  you guys look really good  last night  you losers  yeah well  a little ranger fan  on the phone here  he's a ranger fan man  and you guys are  that much better  oh yeah  you guys know it  you're having a pretty good year  but you're not  winning anything  this year either  did you see D.P.H.O  he looked like garbage man  he didn't look like garbage  when your team  when you guys had  like 20 shots 
[00:53:30]  on goal  in the first period  yeah well you guys  couldn't even get a shot  he was shell shocked  well that's the problem  you can't blame D.P.H.O  I'm not gonna get into  hockey talk  look at you  look dude  it wasn't D.P.H.O's  fault is all I'm saying  when you shoot on him  that many times  of course a few  were gonna go in  making a mad dog show  he was shell shocked  it was like 20 shots  on goal  to the Islanders 4  the first period  dude if the back line  is not gonna do their job  and knock that puck away  that's right  is that accurate  just be a ranger fan  nope  never  never  alright bro  thanks Petey  even when the team stinks 
[00:54:00]  I'll stick with them  Mike in New York  what's up  talking about famous people  little Jimmy Norton  on Dateline tonight  actually I think  it's 2020  2020  see look  no one even knows  the shows  it's like Dateline  60 Minutes  2021  I think Jimmy's  gonna be on  2020 tonight  at 10 o'clock  yeah channel  on ABC  on ABC  we should bet  how much camera time  we get  I say zero  oh that's a great bet  I say zero  the 2020 crew  was in here  now I'm confused  2020  Monday 
[00:54:30]  now I'm confused  I was ready to call  Dateline  or something  60 Minutes  2020  Dateline  guys don't confuse  everybody  it's 2020  tonight at 10  on ABC  the crew was in here  for 4 straight hours  and you're right  you and I will get  maybe  3 seconds of air time  I think it's gonna be  Jimmy here in the studio  yeah  with a quick pantos  laughing  you think  and then his bit  on the street  laughing at him  yeah we get nothing  well not that ABC  wouldn't want to promote you 
[00:55:00]  I mean  we get nothing  and they're not even  gonna say Opie and Anthony  they're gonna say  Jim Norton  does a  a satellite radio show  a satellite radio show  not even XM  yeah  no it won't even be XM  Opie and Anthony  it's gonna  but your name  will be all over the piece  it's just how they work  it's fine  yeah  but guys  no pantos laughing  that's all we're gonna get tonight  we know it's about you Jimmy  not about us  but guys  but I don't want that  yes you do  if I'm lucky  they  no I do  I really don't  if I'm lucky  they might use me  just doing the old tagline  hey it's Opie and Anthony  on XM satellite radio 
[00:55:30]  and then boom  right to Jimmy  some b-roll of the  and then Anthony laughing  and then we brought  Jimmy on the street  and this is what we found out  when he cursed at people  not even that much  not even that much  not even that much  we'll see  I don't think so  we'll have the audio  for Monday's program  I hope I don't look fat  I think if anything is used  from in this studio  it'll just be Jimmy  which is fine  it's fine  yeah  no problem with that  wouldn't it be funny  if all they showed  in the studio  was just Eric  no audio  just him  sitting there  looking retardedly  at that computer screen  fucking homoerotically

Raphael from Connecticut  thank you  bye  one of the 
[00:59:00]  losing participants  unfortunately  Raphael  scored on gentlemen  how are you sir?  oh my balls  are a little sore  they're what?  my balls are a little sore  but  any swelling?  not really  how many stings?  two stings  yeah he said that  I guess on the show  one for each nut  Raphael got stung twice  didn't you have  the honeybees?  yes  okay so he had  the fucking  faggity honeybees  and your ball bag 
[00:59:30]  didn't swell up  or anything?  not really  not that I noticed  no?  but uh  and just sore  from the mousetraps?  yes  how about from  the waxing  the rough waxing?  that really didn't  bother me at all  I kind of enjoyed that  why did you enjoy that?  I don't know  actually when Raphael  did the wax strips  it wasn't that bad  unfortunately we learned  a lot from Raphael  we learned a lot  about balls  well no  because Raphael  with the mousetraps  he just put four 
[01:00:00]  on his ball bag  and then that's when  we're all thinking  whoa how many  can these guys  get on their ball bag?  Raphael wasn't going  for the record  in the beginning  and then with the wax strips  it hurt a little  but we realized  you had to warm up  the wax strips  even more  and we got a better  reaction from the  other two guys  afterwards  so Raphael  was like a test  subject yesterday  but a hell of a  trooper  got stung twice  by the bees  and you just got  a sore ball bag  today? 
[01:00:30]  yep  alright we're going  to get video up  on opianathlete.com  there's two clips  up there now  we'll have many more  as the weekend goes  alright I already  watched them  so  anything else?

[01:05:00]  but I  I heard of him  oh this cocksucker  treated me like  dog  shit  and I think  let me tell you  you can't do  free radio no more  after you do this show  now  or if you do  another show  that's like  popular on  any other  like  they hate  your fucking guts  they cut  hey  alright  yeah  this is not  satellite  so I call  man cow show  I'm like  hey man  so here's what  happened  he goes  I go  yeah  what's up man 
[01:05:30]  he was  you know how you  can hear the show  while you're on hold  he played a couple  things  I go  oh man  that was some funny shit  and I go  oh fuck  my bad man  my fault  right  because you actually said  when he went live  hey that was some funny shit  when you were hearing it on hold  right  and you realized you cursed  and you apologized right away  yeah  he goes  yeah  and then  Captain CSI  that fucking idiot  goes  yeah Patrice  it's not  it's not  satellite radio  huh  well thank you  who's Captain CSI  Billy

[01:06:30]  fat guy dancing  oh yeah  no no  farting preacher  oh farting preacher  right  I saw the farting preacher  oh yeah  I did that 10 years ago  yeah  I did that 10 years ago  I go  by the way  when you say  I did that 10 years ago  that farting preacher bit  every radio guy in America got  all he had to do to do that bit  was push play  right  like it was one of those obvious things  that probably  invented it  it was probably  it was one of those obvious bits  that probably hundreds of guys  just pushed play  and had on their show  they didn't do anything  they just pushed play 
[01:07:00]  and and and  it's so different than what  it is on web junk 20  now that clip is  being seen by a mass audience  you couldn't show that clip on radio  that's why it's so special  to see the guy's face  as he's preaching  and closing his eyes  and that's where the farts come in  that's what makes that bit  so funny  is the visual  I'm not fucking jerking off  the thing like it's Dallas  or or  you know what I mean  like it's groundbreaking  it's like  yeah I'm on the show  doing the thing  but he  I never got a chance  he goes  yeah  if you want to see something funny  yeah

[01:08:00]  these days  because he's stuck  on free radio  and he assumed  this was his big opportunity  they'd move him  into New York  every radio guy  wants to be broadcasting  from New York  this is the place to do it  it's either New York  or LA  and he didn't get the call  so he's a very bitter guy  well I don't know  what did Billy Burr say  we're talking  dude  dude man  you came in  and you leaned on the mic stand  which is comic talk  where you just  like mailed it in  and I go  what  how do you mail it in  in four seconds  when a motherfucker goes  fuck you  he goes man 
[01:08:30]  and then he starts to tell me  you ever tell somebody a story  that you told them  and then they tell it back to you  because they fucking forget  that you told  Billy starts giving  fucking me  who lent some of his personality  to the motherfucker  how  how to trash somebody  dude you know  you got  hey  he's man cow  you gotta give him shit  he gives you shit  then if you give it back to him  then he likes you  I said what the fuck  are you talking  Billy are you teaching me  how to like

[01:11:00]  to regular radio  over and over again  oh it's  it sounds like  the same thing  hi this is  WWZZX  in  Fluhatchie  Idaho  we're on the  Smithers and Johnson  now  every  every something  and something  sounds horrendous  to me  I don't know why  Opie and Anthony  doesn't  cause maybe  I know you  that's why  but it's like  McKenzie and  Bullensworth  I'll tell you why  cause we openly  admit that  the name of this show  stinks 
[01:11:30]  sucks on ice  Opie's just my  stupid nickname  since I was 10  or 11  I hate being called  Opie but it's too  late now  I'm not trying to  sit here and go  hey this is cool  it's Opie and Anthony  I know my name  fucking stinks  and it's faggoty  but I'm stuck with it  cause I made my name  in the business  with this name  people call you  on the phone  and go  hey Anthony  what's up  Opie  Opie  O  O and A  that's why I love  the O and A  cause it takes the faggoty  out of the Opie part  no one says Greg  no  Ope  but no one calls

[01:13:00]  how is Bill Burr  able to sit in there  who the fuck knows  well Bill had some dates  in Chicago I guess  but how is he able  to sit in there  and not get shit  cause he's obviously  associated with this program  also  hey dude  hey dude  it's not satellite  thanks Billy  you gotta look  in a situation like that  I didn't hear the show  but you gotta fucking  go to bat for your friend  you gotta fucking  plug for your friend  you gotta go to bat  for your friend  you know how many times  look we run in a horrible circle  me, Jimmy  Colin  you're awful people  come and go  dude 
[01:13:30]  dude man  you're great  but fucking  Norton  no one I hope  or  Colin  a lot  Colin  dude  it's like you go  man  yo man  that nigga's the funniest  motherfucker ever  man  yeah fuck you  such such such  dude  you can't  you mailed it in  dude  this is not satellite  this is free radio  man  Bill Burr  fuck-o list  giving me advice  on how to give people shit  alright  Bill Burr  is on the fuck-o list  no he's not 
[01:14:00]  it's like  he didn't have to  he didn't have to  defend me  but it's like  did you just tell me  what giving shit is  Bill  yeah  did you listen to what happened  that motherfucker  greased me up  I want Bill's side of this  yeah let's get Bill  on the phone  call that motherfucker  and he'll go  dude he can't  he mailed it in  he did the  get the tape  you'll hear what the fuck happened  and then on the phone  he goes  oh I messed up  it was like coke and pepsi  you can't  and then  dude he gave you shit  you know  see the way he is 
[01:14:30]  he gives you shit  you give it back  and then he likes you  what  he's talking like  fucking hopper  in Apocalypse Now  just explain him  man  you don't understand him  man  are they gonna say  he was a funny man  he was a good caller  are you fucking joking  I'm like huh  nah I said bullshit  that's what  I said  nah not bullshit  I said  that's some funny shit  funny shit  that's some funny shit  got off on the wrong foot  and then I go  sorry about that man  sorry  didn't mean that  forgot  but then all of a sudden  great opportunity  to put in the  satellite radio tie in 
[01:15:00]  hey this isn't  satellite radio  this isn't satellite radio  and  and  and  it's free  and it's funny  and we don't have to  pay for it  oh boy  and it was over  and yeah  you know what's a funny video  yeah I did that clip  10 years ago  you know what's funny  jimmyshubert.com  he has the horse  killing the guy  on his thing  now that's funny  click  that's like plugging  another radio show  on his show  it was cold  what  you know what  it's his show  I don't give a fuck  that's calculated  but let me  say that you ain't shit  yeah  let me say you ain't shit 
[01:15:30]  matter of fact  we couldn't even have  an argument over the radio  cause I'll go  faggot  you ain't shit  he'll go  okay you can't  you can't have an intelligent  hoodlick  hoodlick with me  I don't get into  no clever quips  with motherfuckers  you know what  you destroy people  and he did not want to  he's familiar with you  enough to know  that you would have  crushed him  if you would have been able  to go back and forth  one time  hey I'm on Fox  this morning  hey what do you think  Hurricane Katrina  it's crazy out there  man  Hurricane  watch out  my left eyebrow 
[01:16:00]  is going up  something wild  and fucking wacky  is gonna happen  buckle down  your fucking harnesses  cause I am a cow  and I could just  turn into a bull  watch your china  you fucking faggot  how about the pest  take on man cow today  and make his life  a living hell  yeah go ahead pests  his show is  in it's first hour  up there in Chicago  I don't even know  this cocksucker  thanks fellas  let's see if he'll  take on some of the  pests  they didn't even say  Opie and Anthony  would not say Opie 
[01:16:30]  satellite radio  yeah  what else are they  talking about  80's channel  that fucking 80's channel  what the fuck  is it with  the theme from Rocky  listen they're all  Broadway show tunes  channel is the problem  let me explain something  too cause we know  radio like the back  of our hands  all these cocksuckers  are so jealous  of Anthony and I  and it's a fact  because when satellite  radio first started  all these guys  are like ah  satellite radio  now it's blowing up  and satellite radio  especially XM  our philosophy  we're not interested  in just throwing 
[01:17:00]  a bunch of  hack shows on the air  thinking they're  gonna be better  you know  it's more of an  entertainment type of  thing we're doing  here at XM  it's not just get  radio shows that  were okay  and bring them  over  we're very picky  with what radio  shows we're gonna  bring over here  and these guys are  frustrated that they're  not getting the call  and frustrated they  can't do the type of  radio that we pulled  off yesterday  and the only thing  they could say is  it's free and it's  funny  we did a show  yesterday that you  couldn't even touch  on regular radio  that people are  saying is the best  radio we've ever  done 
[01:17:30]  with the beast  thing and the guys  in the ball bag  and there's a  difference between  busting somebody's  balls and everybody  knows and fucking  being sabotaged  and you know  as a comic you  know when it's  happening  you know exactly  what's happening  okay  they're saying  you gotta go  it's like  you fucking know  and you give a  motherfucker a long  time to suck  and if you fucking  it's a back and  forth  all you have to do  is say hey  you fat fucking  heck you're doing  a web show  what is that  I go well  it's a web show  fuck face 
[01:18:00]  oh  you can't  swear  holy doodly  mooing out here  I'm mooing the  fucking way baby  watch out  and it's like  just give a  motherfucker a  chance to say  okay you don't  like me  but don't fucking  say okay  you wasn't being  funny  yeah  yeah  he's another  one of these guys  he's such a  phony  it's unbelievable  but you know  something Patrice  he's not just a  man  he's a cow  he's a cow  it's like two  things  he's an oxymoron

[01:21:30]  what works  with that  show  down in  the  warehouse  the  attitude  of you  motherfuckers  down there  you don't  need  words  the  facial  expressions  on you  miserable  motherfuckers  sitting down  and looking  at these  fucking  office  guys  you worked  12 hours  I understand  what was the  setup  he's got the  pizza eating  thing down  he didn't need  12 hours  to eat  pizza  your hassle  half line  was funny  did I say that  did they say  you don't shush  negroes  did I get to  say that  no I didn't  hear that  when he shushed 
[01:22:00]  the guy  and said  you don't shush  negroes  nothing  no I heard  him shush  and then  the other guy  got a line  and you got  nothing  why do I do  it  so all your  friends can go  look it's  Patrice  it was funny  it was like  look Patrice  exactly  but if you  don't know me  it's like  look  here's this  fat extra  here's this  under 5  barely  barely under 5  it's under 3  all you're gonna do  is eat pizza  on the office  I guess  man cow 
[01:22:30]  should be  abusing you  that's what I'm  saying  I don't mind  getting abused  for the goofy  web show  abuse it  what's it called  it's web junk  web junk 20  web junk 20  it is what it is  when are you on  shut up  I'm serious  I'm gonna plug you  I'm calling in  another radio show  and I'll have  nothing funny to say  so I'll plug your show  that stupid show  that stupid show  is fucking up  my DVR recordings  what is it on  every night  it's on every hour  I got a hundred  versions of web junk 20  because I still haven't 
[01:23:00]  figured out how to  just record it once  and that's it  so every time it's on  it records  it's like an infomercial  it's just on  it really is  it's just on  and I don't complain  about it  I think how can you  make money through  placing ads in the  paper  Patrice will tell you  we  we get  the show comes on  so fucking much  and sometimes I'm  like embarrassed  I think we're  celebrating our  hundredth anniversary  only three episodes  your hundredth episode 
[01:23:30]  already syndicated  on channel 9  it's unbelievable  how many times  they run the show  it's amazing  I can't complain  web junk 20  right after Seinfeld  on channel 5  New York  alright let's see  what Sarah has  Sarah  hey they have a  new commercial  over here in Boston  for AAF  with Dennis Leary  on it  our old station  WAF  in Worcester  Massachusetts  and at the very end  it says no fee  required  they're trying to  push that it's free  and it's so good 
[01:24:00]  yeah that's fine  Leary can cut  he can cut  promos for free  FM ads  but then  when he comes in here  he can hang out  for an hour  and talk like he  could never talk  on regular radio  so we know  what he enjoys more  wait I hear the  commercial  hacky radio  commercial stuff  it's totally hacky  explain the commercial  he wakes up in bed  and you hear the radio  coming on  and I don't know  any of the DJs  on there  because I don't  listen to FM anymore  but he wakes up  and all the guys  from the morning 
[01:24:30]  radio show  are in bed  with him  and he's like  I didn't mean  for you  I wake up  with you  I didn't mean  wake up  with you  in bed  with me  and then  they're all  in the  shower together  and he's like  Leary doesn't  do shower scenes  and it was  just so bad  it was horrible  but it's typical  AAF  what Patrice  oh not to her  I just wanted  to make sure  I wanted to say  something  after she's finished  oh yeah  and that was the end 
[01:25:00]  and then it just says  no fee required  it was really bad  but  yeah they're just  they're so worried  they're doing this whole  free no fee required  that's great  but you gotta do  some good radio  for people to go  yeah you know what  this radio is so good  yeah and it's free  I guess I don't need  to go to satellite  well they miss you guys  you gotta back it up  with really good radio  just to go on TV  and say hey  it's free  so that's why  you should listen  no  no  it doesn't make it good 
[01:25:30]  alright  thanks Sarah  Bill Burr's on  Man Cow today too  all morning  let's say how to  Jim and find out  Jim  Jesus  what's he doing  I'm listening to  Man Cow this morning  I figured I'd check it out  since you guys  are hyping him quick  they're advertising  Billy Burr's  gonna be in his studio  all day  figured that'd give  something for the  test to tear up on  yeah give him a call  alright  we wanna try to get  Bill on our show  today too  to see what  what that was all  about yesterday  the phone call  to Patrice  that ain't gonna work  if he's over there  all day  I wanna also say please  there's a person on there  who created a

[01:28:30]  they're you  and you know  hooking up a fucking date  with a 12 year old girl  well I'm here to say  and you don't get the benefits  and me missing out  I was listening  I knew where you were going  and I jumped it first  I wasn't worried about it  it was me and that guy  standing behind the 7-Eleven  going  what are you doing here  I was listening to that shit  and that's what got me nervous  I was like  I was gonna let the guy have it  cause he's saying  where I'm gonna be  there you go  that's nice  he's being me  right  he's doing your footwork  I can't be mad  but I can't allow that to happen  right  no  I can't let a motherfucking be me 
[01:29:00]  he can do awful things  a string of dead girls  all in your top 8  every girl you email  has fucking  wants him in a ditch  with leaves on his face  Jesus  hey before we take a break  I want to get some clips in  from yesterday's show  oh yeah  it's time to play these  we got three clips  and we're gonna have  video clips on  opianthony.com  we got a couple now  but we'll have more  as the weekend unfolds here  it was Super Bowl  Thursday yesterday  Gavin missed it  like you have to say 
[01:29:30]  it was  well I'm telling you  who in the world  doesn't know  I'm telling you  we're gonna play  three short clips here  and people are gonna hear  these for the first time  yeah  so we had three guys  come in and just  abuse their nutsacks  basically  mousetraps  and what have you  what a fantastic day  it was  and then the ultimate  challenge was the bees  in the jar  and the bees  in the apparatus  and the entire  bees nest  that the guy dumped  completely on his nutsack  which was the grand finale  he put his bollocks 
[01:30:00]  in a wasp nest  he put him in a jar  with a wasp nest  in the jar  and then leaned backwards  so it went against  his ball bag  so it was air sealed  oh yeah  and there were bees  in the bottom too  that caked with bees  in the jar  it's the worst thing  I've ever seen  was those bees  coming to life  and that fucking  just attacking  his testicles  I've got to see  the video  it's going to be up  it's going to be up  somebody  somebody took 
[01:30:30]  a piece  from web junk  and  took a video clip  I think it was  mic pop  on whack bag  took a clip  of you  and superimposed  the clip  you were talking about  with a clip  of me and Jimmy  waving our arms around  like we were being  attacked by bees  and you just  with this disgusted  look on your face  looking at the video clip  so it looks like  you're  reviewing  us here in the studio  being assholes  great job  photoshop  hey  Shane  from Rockland 
[01:31:00]  real fast  good morning guys  man cow's getting  bombarded  I ramoned him twice  and he fucking  dumped out  yeah yeah  they love dumping  well tape your phone calls  if you have that capability  because we want to  hear some of this  alright definitely  give it a try guys  that number again  for man cow  888-2-MANCOW  yeah pour it on guys  full bore attack  on this idiot today  or 3-1-2-5-9-1-5-COW  3-1-2-5-9-1-5-COW  alright some clips  from yesterday 
[01:31:30]  they're short  and to the point  but Super Bowl Thursday  I think this first clip  is Matt going for the record  how many mousetraps  did he get on his nutsack  I think he was attempting  number 7  in this clip  that we're going to  play right now  7 mousetraps  oh you're wrong  I know that  what are you doing  it is Eric's fault  you know some people  just think this is about  slapping your ball bag  in a mousetrap  and taking the pain  but there is a true  strategy here  as to where you're  placing these mousetraps  on your yam bag 
[01:32:00]  and I see as he goes  for 5  mousetrap number 6  loaded and lined up  and I believe  a very optimistic Bill  is loading up  trap number 7  you're insane Bill  you're insane  it ain't gonna happen  not this year  Matt from New York City  going for the 5th mousetrap  hanging way over  way over the side  wow he is really hard  to keep into a camera  he's  oh  even side to side  he's looking to see  if he has room for 6  Anthony  room for 6 
[01:32:30]  6 would be a  new world record  this is something  I have never seen before  and I  I  I gotta  you know  it's a moment  I want to tell  my grandchildren about  here he goes  it's a moment  they would love to tell  their grandchildren about  he's actually reaching  back and pulling  asshole skin  to the front  here it is  oh  a new world record  a new record  6  he's going for 7  Anthony  he's going for 7  no way  no way  not 7  and do I see 
[01:33:00]  mousetrap number 8  waiting on deck  there can't  I  I refuse to believe  this is even possible  the only thing  that's gonna stop  this kid  is lack of skin  that's all  that's gonna stop him  lack of skin  the drive  here we go  number 7  that's a tough spot  he's picking over there  7th mousetrap  I don't know about this  to the ball bag  I think he's gonna have  to go more for  part of the upper  penile skin  and lower penile skin  upper yam bag skin  it's still officially  nutsack but it's getting  a little too close  he's rifling through  these like a janitor 
[01:33:30]  looking through his keys  number 7  oh my god  wait do we have one  that fell  yes  oh my god  it's only 6  there is only 6  it's just a skin issue  but 6 is the record  sir  that is more than  respectable  6 mousetraps  and we're back live  Patrice is like  how did he fit all those  he was just finding  skin  he just found  yeah he kept pulling  new bag skin  out from under his ass  from like  any loose bag skin  yeah  I think there was 
[01:34:00]  some taint on one  oh yeah  but that qualified  it was  probably is writhing  in pain  that's why  you try to talk  to him today  yeah  and he's like  I don't know  all medicated  and then  and then they moved  on to the wax strips  what's that  alright those are the wax  oh Taren  what are you doing  oh boy  you thought he was talking  so you decided  to start the  I've never seen  I've never seen  Elo like  I mean  E-Rock  I've never seen him  this  flustered  he's very jumpy  for some reason  but this around 
[01:34:30]  like usually he just  bam  he's like  sneak  what's going on  today dude  nothing  you having troubles  I thought you said  you segued into it  and then  something's wrong  oh boy  he started the tape  and then  I go  why are you doing that  he goes  I thought Patrice was talking  so then that would mean  you wouldn't start the tape  right  I meant that  I stopped it  because he was talking  not that I started it  because he was talking  look at the smiles  in the engineering room  over there  he doesn't get enough sleep  he's a smart  he's a very smart kid 
[01:35:00]  what time  about 11  about 11  I barely make it to 10  and what time you get up  4.30  so you're not sleeping  not quite enough sleep  because he does that every night  it's not  anyone could do  one of those nights  where you get just a few hours sleep  and you can deal  but he does that every night  yeah  so his focus is all  fucked up at times  they're all in there  going  and we don't  they get the same amount  of sleep in there  pretty much  yeah  I have never ever seen him  as many times 
[01:35:30]  as I came through  he just sits in the corner  and kind of  y'all fuck with him  every once in a while  but today it's like  he's noticeably  he's jittery  he's all flustered  yeah  alright  so the next clip  the next clip  and this is going to be  videos of all this  on opnetthony.com  sometime this weekend  the wax strips  they took wax strips  to their ball bags  listen to this clip  alright  those are the wax strips  that Bill has taken out  these are wax strips  used normally 
[01:36:00]  I guess to  bikini wax  or girls get waxed with  mustache wax  ladies  anything  alright  are there any Italian girls  out there  stop  a lot of them do  oh my god  is that sticky  a lot of them do  is it  oh my god  yeah that's going to hurt  alright Steve is up  from Connecticut  he's got the wax strips  you got some hairy  he doesn't care  he's got the head  caught  oh god 
[01:36:30]  oh god  did they get that on camera  oh my god  oh my god  Ari what do you think  this is the most horrifying thing  I've ever seen  on my entire life  that looked like it  it hurt  explain that  if you can  it's worse than  trying to pull  Turkish taffy  off of flypaper  it stuck to it  it was like  an old fruit roll up  it was amazing  he was pulling  and it kind of got stuck  and then he just 
[01:37:00]  yanked as hard as he could  to get it off  yeah  yeah it didn't just come off  it stretched it out  really far  and then made a velcro sound  when it came off  I'm not comfortable  with this at all man  you're not comfortable  with this at all  this is a man  that watched his friend  get  I'd rather watch that again  it's better than  getting your balls waxed  the last case  I'm getting caught  on the wax  this was the grand finale  so now they got  the apparatus  with the bees in it  on their nutsacks  completely  what  submerged  or whatever  in bees 
[01:37:30]  clean wax balls  and we weren't  we weren't getting  the ending  that we were hoping for  so Matt realized that  so there was a  a jar  that had about  80 wasps  were bees  yeah  they were wasps  those were the wasps  right  yeah  a little nest  in a jar  that had 80 of them  he takes the jar  shoves his nutsack  in there  and then dumps  the nuts  the jar  completely on his nutsack  so now the freaking  hive is right on his nutsack  and then all hell  broke loose  and he's getting stung  and then we're freaking out 
[01:38:00]  because we think  he's just going to drop  the jar  and 80 wasps  will be released  if bees were stinging  my nuts  and I had a jar  with my nuts in them  the first thing  I would do  well would not be  to shove my nuts  in the jar  the second thing  I would do  is take the jar  and fling it  away from my nutsack  and start brushing  my nuts off  right  it's just me  and then the show  ended abruptly  because we're on  some kind of computer  thing that just  shuts us down  at a certain time  no matter what happens  so this is how  Super Bowl Thursday 
[01:38:30]  ended yesterday  YouTube scary  I thought it was like  1055  and it was like  oh my god  the show's over  they fired us  again  they just cut us off  motherfuckers  we left them thinking  it was certainly a cliffhanger  listen for yourself  where's that last jar  oh my god  who brought another jar  what was in the other jar  four small paper wasps  that I'm shaking up  vigorously  do you want to go  for the four paper wasps  god damn it  no not that jar  not the nest  plug it up  that thing is gonna  nest  nest 
[01:39:00]  nest  oh god  we only have a minute  left in the show  a minute left in the show  oh he's going with the  entire  a minute left in the show  holy shit  when the show ends  just end it  because we can't get  plugs or anything  plug that shit up  we only have a minute  left in the show  can we go a little long  is it possible  no we can't go long  no it cuts off  and it'll go right to  alright we got a minute 15  Matt has put the jar  that has the nest of bees  don't drop it 
[01:39:30]  if you get stung  don't drop it  holy shit  jump up and down  this is the grand finale  Matt  the current  ball champion  he has his balls  for the wasp nest  he's got his balls  in a jar  that has a little wasp nest  wow  anything  50 seconds  they're on it  here they come  they're on it  here they come  oh shit  here they come  we have 40 seconds  left in the show  he is basically  shaking the jar  upside down  right onto his nutsack 
[01:40:00]  oh god damn it  you put the entire nest  against his sack  oh my god  the whole nest  is against his sack  30 seconds less  in the show  what courage  30 seconds  the cameras are rolling  this is for the title  Matt  you are a mad man  hold the jar  hold the jar  get the jar  again  where's the cover  give him the cover  give him the cover  give him the cover  don't spray his balls 
[01:40:30]  kill me again  get him the cover  give him the fucking cover  give him the cover  that's where it cut off that's how it ends oh my god his his horrible scream that's how  he started getting stuck like crazy screaming he couldn't find the cover to the jar no one knew  where the so he held the jar on his sack and everyone's looking for the cover uh there was  somebody who had the the pesticide yeah opie was ready to spray his cock with pesticide and jimmy 
[01:41:00]  don't spray don't spray find the cover there's screaming and then it cuts off like a 911 phone  call gone bad well when the bad guy pulls the cord out after he shoots the family see the video though  because he was in such a panic and he was trying to do the right thing but any moment he was going  to lose it and just drop the jar which would have filled the studio with uh angry wasps easily hungry  for more ball sack it was a perfect uh ending to a radio show yeah wasps and wasps yeah i think they 
[01:41:30]  live when they sting you yeah they do yeah carry on yeah they do live it's please me and jimmy  were in big bee suits bees die so they couldn't uh hurt us so we didn't care who else got injured  funny is it well here we go ladies and gentlemen he's in here and everything ladies and gentlemen  the winner of super ball thursday it's matt from new york city matt good morning fellas how are you  sir look at that listen to the pride good morning gentlemen and esteemed colleagues and how are you 
[01:42:00]  doing my friend this guy got it this guy got it he knew there was nothing going on near the end of  the show and we were building this thing up for days and he said man fuck this i'm going to do  whatever i can to get these things to sting me when is the super ball cock ring ceremony  they're so gaudy but you wear them with pride and they play the ball bag national anthem  how are you bollocks how are they yeah matt how are you today retire his jock strap and hang it in the 
[01:42:30]  rafters huh matt wonderful day the end of that show was so surreal yesterday it's like sort of like a  blur did you just like blank out because i saw your face you're like fuck this i'm dumping them  on my dick that's what i had to do you know it was the end of the show nothing was happening the other  two guys were pussies so i fucking took the jar and that was it yeah you know and then he's just like  this making sure the whole nest lands on the trooper yeah we had three guys they all did great but 
[01:43:00]  people are not going to forget matt anytime soon oh let's hope matt but uh i got stung four times  you got four stings yeah and when i got home i was okay you know the pain wasn't bad then i was like  before i went to school before i went to school i was like you know what i should take a look at it  because i was still sticky so i was like let me clean off my fucking dick so i'm not sticking in  class i'm sitting there so i started cleaning it off and i'm like what the fuck is that i had a third  it felt like i had a third nut it was so swollen oh you had a big knot on your bag look like a coconut tree 
[01:43:30]  that's exactly what it looked like it felt like what the fuck what am i just doing i'm trying to  get a hard on to see if i could still get a hard on i was a little worried then i'm like oh my god  what the fuck's going on here yeah i'm like let me let me ice it up on the way to school yeah i took  an ice bag i put it on my cock now i'm sitting down with my fucking pants half down driving to school  going i'm gonna get there i'm like i look down my fucking pants are soaked now i'm fucking walking  into class my pants soaked my fucking jacket on hanging off i have a broken arm and i look like 
[01:44:00]  a fucking mess his arm's broken yeah his arm's broken too jesus it was a fucking horror show oh you  broke your arm on the job yeah yeah yeah a couple days ago now you think it's gonna mess up your suit  against your job that you you went you was well enough to go get your balls attacked by japanese  japanese kill a wasp you fucking idiot this guy's a psychopath yeah but the end of the show though  as i was when i was getting stung i was like what the fuck there's before i even started you guys 
[01:44:30]  both were yelling don't drop the jar i'm like thinking in the back of my mind i cannot drop the  show no matter what i do be honest how close did you get to dropping that jar everybody wants to  know because it's our lives were in your hands not our lives but our safety i guess i tell you i was  very close and all i hear is jim norton yelling where is the cover get him the cover you know what  we need to do take that clip that last clip when pandemonium is happening right before the uh  show cuts out yeah i want very well produced gunfire over that to make it sound like a vietnam scene 
[01:45:00]  with like uh some uh guns going off that would be perfect it would sound like that war the fog of war  kind of confusion and and just fright that it was weird and yeah you could still hear him yeah  screaming yeah the screaming i'm gonna take your idea hold on hold on we're gonna do that definitely  definitely do what anthony just said this is for the listeners easily if the guys want to help it out  another production another listener project so yeah you do what anthony said with the gunfire and 
[01:45:30]  whatever you want to add to it yep also because it was a cliffhanger and just ended and there were a lot  of people out there because my email went crazy people like all right what the fuck happened what  the fuck right were the bees released did people get stung did you guys get fired i think people  need to make their own ending now oh wow an open ending that the listeners can now what continue on  the audio use the audio and then right where it ends that's where you as the listener picks up it  and make make your own ending and send it in a news report maybe i think any way they want to use 
[01:46:00]  that ending audio right the audio that of the pandemonium breaking out right if you want to put  the hindenburg guy over it right going oh get out of the way oh this is the worst catastrophe i've ever  seen yeah yeah things like that just any horrific things that uh that could fit into there's your next  audio project yeah there's two things the the anthony thing which is a great idea and also maybe you  know uh your ending too yeah just you can take maybe clips from continue like the show platoon yeah 
[01:46:30]  things like that right because the audio just ends so abruptly there's something there frightening  maybe you as the listener comes in as a news reporter or something i don't know they're so stink  did you guys see where the jaw cover was huh did you guys see where the jaw cover actually was  it was stuck to the back of my hand from earlier on with the wax trap holy shit that's why you  couldn't find it no one can find the lid oh it was a wax monster i thought you actually gave him  a brazilian a professional waxing it was like the wax oh the glue traps no the lawyer said no to the 
[01:47:00]  glue traps but they said yes to these uh plastic sheets that were covered in this wax so it's pretty  much a glue trap that they had on their uh ball bag but it's for it's for hair but it's for hair  removal yeah i understand yeah so my hands are sticky for that and that's where the cap was on the back  of my head i was wondering who the fuck is the jokester that hid the lid to the goddamn jar  and this guy is such a loyal trooper god he was holding it the whole time yeah he had it in his 
[01:47:30]  hand that's the type of fear confusion and shit that was going on he had the lid in his hand and  had no idea he didn't even know it this guy is such an obedient ass i would have threw that fucking  b-ball jar against one of you motherfuckers oh yeah stuck my balls yep and he's like just thinking  to himself why he's being murdered by bees take the pain take the pain take the pain i want you to  bag this piece of shit y'all look at this piece of shit here good look at this lump of shit y'all  think you know about your bag being stung by bees i'll tell you about bag being stung by bees 
[01:48:00]  yeah i can't believe he held on that's like he said all i was thinking about was  don't disappoint the fellas right i like that kind of loyalty matt is a is a trooper and he is the uh  superbowl one champion he gets to uh wear that title proudly for a year right until the next one  and i'm sure uh barring any unforeseen circumstances matt will you return or hope to return for next 
[01:48:30]  year yes i'm going to recuperate for a month and then start going to training into training he's  going to figure out how to get more mousetraps on his bag uh a few more of the freestyle this was the  first year we did this so uh there's a freestyle event next year the freestyle event will be much  bigger yeah and then there's mousetraps and then the listeners think up their own things they want  to do to their nuts which we call the freestyle segment yeah uh one guy took you ever see those  spoons with the the points on them that people use to take pasta out of pasta pots with a spork 
[01:49:00]  yeah it's almost like a spore size ladle yeah it's like a ladle with spikes on it uh he took that  and had his girlfriend uh pull it back like a big spring and snap it onto his sack from uh on this  granite table they have ballettes with them yeah yeah little wives to help out girlfriends ball abuse  groupies right to help out oh yeah and uh i think next year we're gonna have cheerleaders and  everything you think we're gonna have a pre-game show a halftime show we're here i think we ought 
[01:49:30]  to have some of our stupid thing together in a couple days you wait some of our sponsors come up  with special commercials just for the event do you like knives to your balls uh-uh honey do you like  sticks to your nuts no not me celebrity calling with lance armstrong  dude it's not funny to lose a nut on purpose another clip with richard belzer and here comes 
[01:50:00]  tom green gonna be joining us for this segment and quick who else had cancer quick quick quick  yeah i know i bet you rafael's in connecticut somewhere in the dark just just training lifting  bricks fucking push-ups in the mud  oh my god yes opie penis weight lifting well we've done that we've done it and we should do  it again bring it back that could be part of super ball too and we'll also get the uh studio up to 110 
[01:50:30]  degrees so they got a lot more a lot more bag area yeah temperature definitely makes a difference  it was a little too cold in here i'm gonna tie your balls in a nut because i think i think seven  mousetraps on a ball bag is nothing i think i i think if you really tried you could you think you  could get five on each side double figures easily if you get ten on easily i was stunned at three and  the guy took it up to six i'm stunned at one the fact that anybody would intentionally do that 
[01:51:00]  yeah after a mousetrap snaps on your balls your only response would be how the fuck did this just  happen who put this here not go ahead load up another i'm sorry i'm running out of skin all  right matt we got to move on here so any final words uh no no i'm just uh tell everybody to  practice so because they're going to need it for next year all right we only got oh that was mac  we only got two clips up on opianthony.com right now we'll have many more sometime during the  weekend yes all right all right thank you matt thank you he only has a few minutes here we got  to say hi to frank caliendo frank how are you buddy good guys how are you uh we had a crazy 
[01:51:30]  day here at uh at uh the opian anthony show yeah we did another opian anthony experiment sounds like  it i was gonna just come on as mad and go you know i've had my sex done by bees and boom  you can play with them for hours after that we need a professional announcer for uh next one  why don't we get you to announce this for us yeah that sounds good i mean we've been trying to  figure out uh things frank can do for the show yesterday was perfect we're so stupid perfect 
[01:52:00]  or a watch to a ball or possibly just when things are going great for him at uh mad tv he's like in  so many sketches now you're one of the veterans now over there aren't you yeah well it's my last  year so it's it is why is that well just moving on they're not throwing you out are they no how many  seasons do very well how many seasons frank uh it's been five now five seasons frank don't do it  stay stay on the fucking show man please don't do the whole moving on thing oh he's gotta stop at 
[01:52:30]  david caruso just stay where you are and just ride it out he's got a great gig with the nfl though too  yeah the nfl i'm gonna he works he works well with terry bradshaw and the rest of the gang  yeah every week you know because now they're allowing you to do some uh some lengthy uh pieces now  now at mad uh no uh with the nfl yeah you know it's been pretty cool i've gotten uh i've gotten  lucky to uh you know they they let us play around with it a little bit more and stuff like that we  you know and the big ones like we did last one we did was this madden one where did you see jimmy 
[01:53:00]  johnson's hair a couple weeks ago yeah and then we did madden had his hair and then we pointed i i go  uh hey costas what do you think of the new haircut and we cut over to bob costas who's played by a  midget and i guess i heard costas wasn't real excited about that but uh sure yeah so we can  let i would did one where we went to the tonight show that's the one i saw leno uh helped out and  uh brought on frank caliendo as uh terry bradshaw yeah and that it was really funny really funny  you do bradshaw too yeah you know i ended up looking more like andy sippowitz but uh with blonde 
[01:53:30]  hair uh but yeah the uh it's it well every week when i'm on the show it's like being on american  idol and bradshaw thinks he's simon cowell you know he's like not funny frank not funny then  after the show he's like very funny frank very funny like why'd you say that was on tv well how  i hadn't explained it to me yet man i'm hungry let's go shoot some squirrels and then look at his  he had a christmas party this year and he invited me to the christmas party and uh he's like uh hey 
[01:54:00]  frank and he had prepared material for me by the way so i get there like hey frank what was you know  what if you lost 20 pounds you can play santa claus i'm like okay great 20 minutes later he's  like hey frank if you lost 40 pounds you could play santa claus oh shit and then at the end of the  night he's like hey frank if i lost 60 pounds i could play santa claus how did you know frank  and i've never seen howie long laugh at any he always looks disgusted yeah yeah after the comedy  thing yeah but see howie likes it howie actually likes it it's very different kimmel kimmel needles 
[01:54:30]  you to death i'm cherubic you know so i can get away with a lot how he's offered to be in sketches  and stuff like that but a lot of stuff like after we did the costas thing with the midget they can't  comment on that because that's their peers you know if they if they try and go with it you know  pretend like that's okay to them but i don't understand that you can't comment and and and have a  laugh at costas's expense that's why every friend you have is in this room opie yeah no but comics  always do that to each other that's the great thing about us we would trash each other those no one else 
[01:55:00]  in the business can do that these guys can walk into events and walk up to people and talk to them  not have to look around and go all right i fucked with that guy that guy can't stand me i wonder if  he heard what i said about him that's why it's smart that we're shut-ins complete we don't have to see  the people we make fun of because we rarely go out in public jocks are a bunch of dummies they're a bunch of  dumb motherfuckers who have no sense of humor about themselves at all jimmy norton said that  well frank caliano i mean when he's doing that what's the show because all those shows to me 
[01:55:30]  is uh look to save so i don't know the name of uh the one terry bradshaw's on uh it's fox nfl  fox nfl sunday right okay no i watch it but a big one to me nobody ever knows the name of it either  because it's fox nfl sunday doesn't sound like a show right the whole day is kind of fox nfl sunday then  you know espn has their show and then there's like four people that watch the cbs show  someone brought up a good point in the room i mean it it's a tough room for you because you're  you're really funny and these skits are really funny and these guys are like they barely uh give 
[01:56:00]  you anything it's like dude come on it's kind of a gimmick you know i guess they keep that they keep  the you know they're supposed to pretend like it's not that great because you know for the true football  fans while they're trying to get ratings by doing all this other stuff right right maybe you should do  a date raping a cheerleader uh bit something they could relate to oh what jock hasn't stop  exactly it's not even really a date rape it's more just hold her down like lenny  when you're petting her hair in the barn and fuck her and hope you don't choke her to death 
[01:56:30]  i'm gonna smack you up bitch  frank what are you doing for the super bowl uh you know what i'm just gonna be in cleveland with my uh  with my wife and son so uh we don't have the the super bowl this year fox doesn't so yeah but isn't  fox doing something pre-game or no no no no when you when you uh when your network doesn't have it  you pretend like the super bowl doesn't exist how funny is that that's true so everybody's home there's  no special terry bradshaw like little house in nowhere i'm sure he's doing something for about 
[01:57:00]  10 people out there just walk around going hey look at me i'm wearing a toupee  and people who don't know i actually get along very well with them off uh camera but you know  i just make fun of them on because they need to laugh every once in a while  she's a scared ass frank now did you uh did you watch the state of the union address  uh i i saw some of it i saw more highlights uh it was uh interesting as they say in uh in the uh  i mean uh wherever you are i hate it when the demon crats gave themselves a standing ovacione now 
[01:57:30]  that is uh that's a french word here's a guy who can't get any words out this morning boom hey maybe  he should get his ball stung by washington i've never done that man i love how half the room look at  gavin's face because he's like i i this doesn't sound like peter uh old cushy the the soccer guy 
[01:58:00]  he doesn't even know who the fuck madden is  we're sitting there we're sitting there going this motherfucker sounds like madden  you nailed madden huh i'm madden who can you do a maggie thatcher  fucking fucking gavin's from across the pond yeah we got a guy from across the pond  don't get it mate and his bush is unbelievable it's dead on it's scary how good it is yeah i  got a slight little bit of cold or something right now but uh yeah did you guys see i i sent you an 
[01:58:30]  email i don't know if you saw i did letterman last week and i actually tried to call you guys  uh and i didn't i didn't have an i didn't have a number at the time oh why didn't frank have a  number it's my fault i i know it's erock's fault a hundred times and i have a computer that erases  everything and uh but letterman letterman saw the tape of me like two hours before the show  and uh i guess he kind of knew who i was and stuff like that but the man he went crazy for the mad  impression and all he did was talk about me doing madden the whole show he's like this kid's gonna 
[01:59:00]  come out here uh do six minutes of john madden and then we're gonna take his pants off and put him  in a cab and it was just crazy and uh and i came out there and as as i went on stage uh i go i'm  looking forward to just a segue to get into the bit i'm like i'm looking forward to the super bowl  mostly because of john madden and from off screen you hear letterman yell  it's the it's amazing for two reasons you sound just like him and no one would think to do john 
[01:59:30]  man no one doesn't it's like who would think to even do an impression of no one else and be  completely correct why and that's why caliendo is still cashing in on it because nobody has found a  way to do it that way that's a bad shit man it's impressive man that's what it can taste better than  a subject right there pull up that positional phrase on there boom you got a chef set let me  does madden does madden think you're the shit like does he impress me what he hates me 
[02:00:00]  madden hates you oh won't come anywhere near me what a douche yeah it's it's always been rough  it's ever since kimmel had me on and cut the uh he we cut jimmy the first sketch jimmy ever had me on  he took a pair of hedge clippers to the john madden eyebrows i was wearing and uh next week john had  his eyebrows clipped and was just i guess he just hated my god oh no someone had to finally point it  out to him i gotta i gotta tell you something about john madden he used to i guess live in my 
[02:00:30]  neighborhood i used to see him walking the streets all the time he just looks like he's miserable  i've never seen him smile he's always just like and i've been in the same restaurants as as him and  people are so intimidated by the guy because he just looks like he's a he's a problem and just  miserable there's a there was a chinese uh restaurant in my hood he ate there all the time  by himself and just looked like he was a very sad human he's probably all travel weary  they're always nasty how about get on a plane motherfucker he's one more buses than fucking 
[02:01:00]  ratso rizzo why don't you fly cocksucker it's 2006 he would walk around with just an old old  hat on like a baseball cap or what have you on a cell phone just like you see that horror movie  the leprechaun he looks like a bigger version of that leprechaun from the movie leprechaun  john you gotta get trash madden oh he's great at what he does but in his personal life he looks  like he's a a very different person and he doesn't fly because he looks like an extra from lord of the  rings like he should be in the background going boom there goes bilbo baggage he's afraid to fly 
[02:01:30]  he's got the uh madden cruiser i guess is the big thing he drives around everywhere he doesn't fly  because i guess some football team in ohio somebody they died all the whole time on a plane  so did buddy so did you know he's claustrophobic that's i've read about this uh he's claustrophobic  and he can't get out of the plane so uh you know he won't get anything sometimes even in a long trip 
[02:02:00]  on the bus i guess he'll just have to get out of the bus and go you know if they i've heard stories  i don't know if these are true but i've heard stories like he'll just get off to drink a six-pack  a beer or something and then just get back on the bus it's just like crazy he just needs to get  away wow he when he travels i've been told that he you know when he's in a hotel you can't go on  the elevator with him they get everybody off the elevator and and if somebody wants to go up at  the same time that they're like no mr madden's going up you'll have to just wait how about this

[02:05:30]  before uh before it gets pitiful yeah of course goose cracks his head on the canopy he's gonna  god bless you know i'm very fair i step back and i i relinquish my thing you know what leave that  horseshit show let bobby lee carry the torch he's getting a lot more exposure with terry bradshaw and  gang that's where i that's where i see him blown up i did see the uh teaching bobby lee uh or uh  was it teaching bobby how to drive bit uh yeah there's some good stuff yeah that was pretty funny  this year that was pretty funny mad tv went away from doing all the uh the gay stuff to now just 
[02:06:00]  trying to to uh you know to trying to be funny for a bigger audience for a while it was and there's  nothing wrong with this but it was it was really geared toward gay men and young women it was a very  weird show that's a strange demo to go after exactly hey has lauren ever called you uh no no  lauren michael weird man why would he frank is talented well they need someone that could do  impressions on that show yeah that john madden is enough for the whole show it's better than the 
[02:06:30]  whole show that's for a whole season right there here's here's another point they need something  that does bush and snl has always been known for having someone that could do the president really  well right right there you should he should hide it even if he looks like he got stung by bees and  had an allergic reaction his face puffed up but you know we're a heavy boy here's a point you guys  know i've been doing pacino forever and it's a cop you know i've been doing a certain style of  pacino for a long time let's hear it for the new listeners a little piece talking like this to my  friends opie and mp the yelling one that's after sea of love pacino that's pacino from sea of love 
[02:07:00]  till now but god but god but godfather pacino though if you could do can you do godfather pacino  not so much i mean i could not that's the subdued pacino yeah but you know it's the post center i could  do it today uh with the cold a little bit not so great but the post center of a woman is what i  mostly know for that yeah and you guys know that remember that when i first met you guys i didn't  even do it on the air i did it on uh conan and i did it in some drops for you yep and then uh then 
[02:07:30]  what happened was uh you guys were like why didn't you do that while you're here i'm like well i wanted  to save something i did almost everything else my my whole repertoire uh so um so and then i did on  mad tv and i remember uh uh anthony saying you know hey it was like a little uh chubby al pacino on  there and nobody you know you guys knew and your audience knew and and which is pretty big and uh  and a couple other in the mad tv audience knew that i did it and i i've been known as doing this 
[02:08:00]  you know good al pacino for a long time well then that do you see that guy on snl did a really good  pacino uh-huh and it was in every magazine about how nobody's nailed pacino like he did uh like yeah  isn't that correct this is a this was a long lead up to how frank is pissing he didn't get credit  right for like the first pacino and shit i'm still battling your no it's not the first pacino but  i'm just battling your argument about why you stay on a tv show it's not an argument i just thought you 
[02:08:30]  just should stay because every time somebody goes they're gonna move on they never move on no i just  understand that you don't believe i'm good enough to do anything else but  fair enough frank he's it he's being fair it's like you know no it's just every it started off with  david caruso and then ended with the puerto rican that left ricky schroeder left maybe it's just  that one horse show you shouldn't believe yeah david new york's gonna cover listen i can take a laugh  at my own expense believe me i've been doing it for a while so it's cool i just uh you know a certain 
[02:09:00]  time you gotta fight back with david horowitz and go for it all right hey frank give us a little  john man as you leave us uh today yeah you know i mean i think that the steelers are gonna take this  one and then i don't even know if the seahawks are gonna show up it's the coffee makers versus  the steelers and boom i'm going with the steelers one more thing guys for the president of the united  states of america seacrest out see you guys later thanks see you man caliando everyone thanks frank 
[02:09:30]  jesus that goddamn man it's impressive every time i see it's like i go how does he pull that off yeah  doesn't it figure that lauren wouldn't contact him doesn't it figure maybe there's a whole mad tv snl  thing but doesn't it figure it's ego there's fucking a guy as funny as that and he does more  than mad at his bush i've never heard a better bush i might have heard i've never i've never ate a  better bush and then you throw in the pacino uh pacino he does the robin williams oh that's right  he does robin williams really well he does chris farley and the poor guy just you know looks you know 
[02:10:00]  just a mushy little you know like fucking norton with bones yeah hey we've been uh we've been  talking for a very long time so let's take a break we got patrice o'neal in the studio yes  kavin the gavin from across the pond you got a nice piss arnold and uh we'll continue  so  so 
[02:10:30]  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, it's a virus, the O and A virus spreading across America.  It smells so raisiny and cinnamony in here now, doesn't it?  Sure does.  I just did a phone-in to Wolf and Tobin in Albany.  It's a commercial radio show.  They're friends, and I like doing them,  and they're the first ones I've done that actually asked about this show  and the hours were on.  Oh, yeah.  They're like, yeah, what time are you guys on?  How's it going?  They're just fucking great.  That was nice of them.  Yeah, but it's just nice to see people that aren't fucking panicking about Satellite.  Yeah, perhaps they're on their way to Satellite one of these days. 
[02:11:30]  Why are you saying hi?  We haven't even introduced you yet.  I was saying hi to him.  He looked at me.  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah, he'll do that.  And we met out there.  Oh, I got confused.  I'm sorry.  He'll do that.  He'll look at you until you're scared.  Gosh, you can say the F word in here?  You can say fuck.  That is fantastic.  Yes.  I always had to curtail myself.  No, not on XM Satellite radio.  Wonderful.  It's nice to talk about anything.  And in order to talk about your life, I think it's best uncensored, to tell you the truth. 
[02:12:00]  Well, I've lived a very uncensored life.  We should introduce everyone to Pamela at the bar.  Hi.  You were a professional groupie?  Well, professional.  I don't know.  There was no word.  You kind of couldn't.  Well, there was no word groupie when I started doing it.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess I sort of invented it.  What was it called back then?  Well, I met Dion's wife.  He was one of my absolute heroes when I was very young.  And she said they were called top 40 fuckers.  I can say it on here.  Top 40 fuckers?  I've never been able to say that.  Yeah.  She said they were girls like me. 
[02:12:30]  We're called top 40 fuckers.  And she said it with disdain.  Yeah.  Because she's been with Dion for a long time.  And I guess he was hit on a lot.  And she had to deal with that?  Being married to him, I guess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I was, you know, I didn't go after married men.  I was very careful that way.  Yeah.  Because I didn't want that to happen to me.  It did, but I didn't want it to.  When did you start, like, hooking up with rock stars?  When I was about 16.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Who was your first?  My first...  You probably have heard these questions a million times. 
[02:13:00]  Yes, I have.  But that's all right.  Maybe we'll have a different spin on it somehow.  Nicholas was actually my first.  I fell madly in love with him.  Who?  He was in Steppenwolf.  Bass player for Steppenwolf.  Oh, okay.  And Chris Hillman was my true, true love.  So you started kind of down the ladder.  Well, no, I didn't...  Didn't get right up there to the upper echelon of rock and roll.  Well, that's who I fell in love with, though.  Really?  Yeah, I was always in love with these people.  And Chris Hillman from The Birds was my real true love.  I saw him off and on for years.  He was the second one.  And Noel Redding, Hendrix Experience, third.  You know, for a while I kept a little list and I knew, but, you know, then I dropped the list. 
[02:13:30]  Any comics on the list?  Well, I had a long affair recently with Michael Richards.  Really?  He's very funny.  Well, yeah.  He's hysterically funny.  He's a stand-up that is out of this world.  Yeah.  A lot of people haven't seen it.  Now, how many rock stars have you been with?  Not that many.  No?  No, because I always tried to stay with them for a while.  For instance, I had never one night stand, not one. 
[02:14:00]  No?  I'm so proud of that.  People think I probably had a hundred of those.  No.  Yeah, we just picture backstage, quick banging, and then...  No, I never did backstage.  Never.  No?  I was always the girlfriend.  The girlfriend.  I don't think I would have written a book about just that kind of stuff.  I am writing a book now about that kind of stuff, though, with other girls,  called Let's Spend the Night Together with all the other groupie stories.  And those are a lot of the just backstage hijinks and...  A lot of down on their knees and favors and do...  But you know what?  They had a good time. 
[02:14:30]  None of them are ashamed.  Now, if you were the girlfriend, you probably saw a lot of that that went on.  Yes, I saw a lot of that.  I was kept away.  Zeppelin were notorious, but Jimmy was my boyfriend, Jimmy Page,  and he kept me away from most of that stuff.  Wow.  Jesus.  It's pretty good on the resume.  Fucking Jimmy Page.  Jesus.  Did you do any black magic with Jimmy Page?  I got him Alistair Crowley scripts, manuscripts.  He collected Alistair Crowley stuff, and there was a guy in Hollywood  who had actual manuscripts with scribbling.  I remember getting him one for $1,100. 
[02:15:00]  It must be worth $50,000 now or something.  He is a very smart collector.  Absolutely more than that, gentlemen.  Really smart art collector and everything.  He's amazing, yeah.  Does he still have Crowley's house?  Yes, he does in Scotland, yeah.  Do you still talk to Jimmy?  Jimmy.  Occasionally.  I'm much closer with Robert Plant.  We stayed really good friends.  So did Jimmy.  I met him once.  And Robert Plant.  Yeah.  He's a great guy.  Got a picture.  He's smiling.  He's the best.  Yeah, we took a really homoerotic picture.  Like, I went for the photo, and his hair is like delicately touching my face, 
[02:15:30]  and we look like a couple of Moe's, but it's still a great picture of the legend.  All right, I got to ask you, the most famous, would you say, Jimmy Page?  Mick Jagger.  Oh, you bang Mick Jagger?  Many times.  Ooh.  Fuck.  Banged.  Wow.  That's such a rude word.  But that's the way I look at it, though.  Yeah, it is.  How about Ozzy?  Did you ever hook up with Ozzy?  Ozzy's a good friend.  Ozzy and Sharon are good friends.  Mm-hmm.  That's a yes.  No, no, I never slept with Ozzy.  No, I never slept with Ozzy.  No.  Why? 
[02:16:00]  Why?  Yeah.  He's not really my type.  Come on.  He's married.  I didn't do the married thing.  How about, all right, who?  Sharon's a good friend.  I knew her before Ozzy.  That's how I met Ozzy.  Where did you do Mick Jagger?  In L.A. and in London.  And you say you didn't do one-night stands, but Mick Jagger's not the girlfriend type, really.  He's jumping around all over the place.  Right, but he liked me enough so that we, you know, stayed in touch, and whenever he  came to L.A., we were together.  When I was in London, we were together.  Gonna wing on over to London and fuck the stones. 
[02:16:30]  Only one stone, thank you.  Yeah.  That's the one you're gonna bang, though.  I mean, I'd probably jerk Bill Wyman off, but I mean, fuck it, if you're gonna have  sex, Mick is the guy.  He was hot.  He's still pretty hot.  He gets the young chicks.  He was 17.  How do you not love Jagger?  He gets the young chicks.  I get the young guys, though.  I do.  Yeah?  Well, my boyfriend's 20 years younger than me.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Is he in the music biz?  Yeah, I think he's a country singer, country, kind of alt-rock country singer in L.A.  Love him.  I gotta ask you, biggest hog in rock, who has the biggest hog? 
[02:17:00]  Hmm.  I don't, you know, I never, I was gonna sign.  Come on.  No, honestly, I was-  But you have to remember.  You have to remember going like, ow.  Yeah.  Well, which one did you look at and go, ugh?  I heard Hendricks had a huge day.  Yes, he did, but I only saw the cast.  I never saw the actual flesh.  Yeah.  Because Cynthia Plastercast is a good friend of mine, but Don Johnson, probably.  He was my boyfriend.  We lived together for a year, and he's happening in that area, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  He's packing some heat.  Yeah, Don is hot.  I heard Huey Lewis had a huge penis, too.  Yes, I've heard that, too, yeah.  I haven't seen it.  Never saw that?  Never hooked up with the Huey?  I always liked the Brits, the British boys.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Prefer them unclipped.  Most embarrassing rock star you've been with, you know, on the way of popularity, and  who would go like, ugh, that's kind of a geeky-  Oh, no.  Like Buddy Holly would be like-  No, I was never with a geeky rock star.  No?  No.  Only the cool guys?  The wildest one was Keith Moon. 
[02:18:00]  I saw him a lot for years.  Waylon Jennings, I was with a lot.  You leave with, like, vomit and cum on you, and you leave the hotel room after Keith Moon.  He was the sweetest, though.  He was.  But you didn't do one-night stands, man.  You're rattling them off.  There's not enough time.  Here's what she's saying.  It's not like a girlfriend, like, we're committed and in love, but it's like, oh, I'll  date you when you're in town and hang out.  Yes, yes, exactly.  It's not just like a one-night thing.  I was the L.A. girl.  All right.  Or sometimes even more.  I would go to London or New York.  But I think that's a little different than being a girlfriend, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that's what you're saying.  But it's not like a girlfriend, like, all right, I'm in love with you. 
[02:18:30]  You don't see other people.  No, it wasn't like that, but it was.  They came to town, and you go out to dinner or go get coffee and what have you, right?  Whatever.  And then go back to the hotel.  But, you know, I would see them for years, like Waylon Jennings and Keith Moon.  I saw them for two, three years.  Waylon, yeah.  Yeah, whenever they, I was, you know, their L.A. chick.  She's a groupie there.  She, like, screwed rock stars there, Patricia Moon.  A little relationships.  Some fantastic ones.  Did somebody already ask about comics and whatever? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, the first thing I asked.  Please, of course.  What did you say?  What happened?  Michael Richards.  Michael Richards.  Yeah.  But see, he was my boyfriend.  You know, we were actually dating for six months.  We didn't see him.  Any guys give you a call and say, hey, man, don't mention me?  No.  Are you kidding?  They all want to be talked about.  And Dave Navarro wrote an intro for my new, you know, I'm with the band.  It's just been re-released.  That's why I'm not doing this.  Did you have sex with Dave Navarro?  All right.  Anytime there's...  No, he's a friend.  He's a dear friend, and he did me a favor writing my preface. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  What's the book again?  I'm with the band.  That's right.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I'm reading Tomorrow Night at Coliseum Books.  She went out with all these guys, Patrice.  She seems so pleasant.  It seems more pleasant than I am.  And Sandra Burkhardt is reading with me.  Speaking of comedians, she's reading with me tomorrow at Coliseum Books here in Manhattan  at 7 p.m.  I think she's very sexy.  Yeah, I do, too.  I would have had a crush on her in my second book.  Not at all.  I write all about this big crush I have on her.  Really?  I like her.  We'll be like her.  What?  They have readings like how people do on C-Span at the book thing?  I'm going to read out of my book. 
[02:20:00]  Really?  Well, it's a little more than a reading.  And I stop and tell stories.  What part are you going to read?  I don't know.  Sandra's going to read the Jimmy Page stuff.  It's pretty hot.  A little racy.  I had orgasm after orgasm, and I could see them and taste them.  They were flavored.  I was on mescaline.  She knows how to work.  I realized that it wasn't milk that shot through my eyeball.  Jimmy Page is great with his fingers, too.  You've got to think that he knows what he's doing.  So Sandra's going to read that. 
[02:20:30]  That's funny.  The nipple and the clit together.  That's fucking fantastic.  Oh, he's just playing down, down, down, down.  You're done now, though, right?  Down, down, down, down, down.  Oh, no.  That guitar is very sexy stuff.  Quick.  The Enneagram song.  I want to come.  And you're done?  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  You're done with that whole life?  My boyfriend, no.  My boyfriend is a musician.  He's 20 years younger than I am.  But you wouldn't call yourself a groupie anymore, would you?  No, no, no.  You hear about Superhead, right?  Like the black girl version of you?  No, I want to hear about her.  Who is she?  You know, Superhead.  I mean, no. 
[02:21:00]  Corinne Stephens, are you serious?  We are on cultural lines here that are not crossing over.  Corinne Stephens is the black version of this girl.  Like hip-hop?  I'm looking for her for my new book.  Do you know who she is?  No, I want to know about her.  She is the one, but it was more of a ventral thing.  This sounds, if I'm not right, this sounds more like, hi, everybody.  Remember I sucked your dick?  Hers is more like, you motherfuckers.  I was down and out.  I licked your balls, and this is what you do to me? 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Bobby Brown, your dick tastes like crack.  You know.  Oh, my gosh.  What is it?  Little Vengeance.  It's called, um, the book is Confessions of a Video Vengeance.  I got some audio.  I got a little taste.  Stop it.  This might be Superhead.  No, it's E-Rock.  You found this.  Corinne's sexual abilities were so well-known, she even received the special nickname, Superhead.  When it began, it was just a joke, you know, that came from a song. 
[02:22:00]  I thought it was cute, and the guys on Murder Ingle called me Sue.  And then when it grew into something ugly, it hurt me.  And I kind of, I was ashamed.  And I saw a video.  I saw a porn video of this girl.  She was in, I think, Mr. Marcus' Neighborhood, part 20.  20, of course.  I think it was 20.  I'm not sure, but in Mr. Marcus' Neighborhood, it was, um, Superhead.  She sucked dick.  Me and my girl watched her, and I see, and my girl goes, so what do you think?  I go, that is officially a professional dick sucker. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  She goes for the cum.  Like, it ain't no, it ain't no fucking, hi, everybody, I'm gonna kiss it, I'm gonna hold it.  She was making a porn star in a porn movie, go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Come on, baby, we gotta fucking do a scene.  I can't, I can't fucking cum right now.  Chill out, bitch.  Cause she did the, the, the number one getting a guy to cum, head job shit, is jerking and  sucking.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[02:23:00]  And he was like, what, bitch, we're not in love.  With spit, with spit.  With spit.  And a ball touch.  A light ball touch.  Swap, slap, slap.  A light ball touch.  She is brutal.  But your thing, it seems like more like everybody would, if they came in there, you know, some  guy would be like, hey, babe, doll, how you doing?  Yes, yes, yes.  Good to see you, baby.  Yes.  Hey.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Corinne is like.  We had relationships.  Oh, she's fucking being, people are torturing her, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Cause, you know, you don't like snitches in the black community.  Why would she do that to herself?  Why would she let that happen?  I don't, how, what, well, how could, like, which, you know, I guess groupie word, what 
[02:23:30]  direction on, on the dark side or the, or the, or the force, how do you end up being  on the force as a, as a groupie and on the dark side?  Right.  What is the wrong thing to do for all the young up and coming fucking groupies to stay good  in the eyes of the motherfuckers you're fucking?  Excellent question.  Yeah.  I think it's selfish, it has to do with how you feel about yourself, your, your own self  esteem and how far you would, would go to, to, you know, to be with someone like that. 
[02:24:00]  Cause I have, I have, I have a girlfriend of mine who would let herself get demeaned  a couple of times and they feel terrible afterwards.  It sounds like this girl did too, but I would never get in a situation like that.  Even if I smelled something weird in the air, I would leave, you know, so it's.  So is this like an ethic where you're not, where, okay, the community of rock stars or  whoever you're sleeping with, they go, you know, what's your name again?  I'm sorry.  Pamela Debar. 
[02:24:30]  Pamela Debar.  They go, Hey man, look, I know one Pam.  She's not going to fuck with your wife.  She's not going to say she was pregnant.  She's not going to snitch on your shit.  She's just going to fuck you, have some coffee.  And, and so does the word spread that you're, you know, she's a good hoe, man.  She's an upstanding motherfucking hoe.  Yes.  I'm sure.  The word goes like you get a reputation for being a decent hoe.  Let's go to the phones.  Will and Debar.  Will, what's up? 
[02:25:00]  Decent person.  Debar, Lord.  Hey, uh, Pamela, by any chance when you were banging Waylon, did he ever, uh, scream out  the name, Jesse?  Run on, get me a name dropping whore.  What?  Oh my God.  Oh, let's see.  Well, Waylon is the, is one of the people I was actually with who, who was married, but  I didn't know it.  I didn't know it.  Yeah.  And, and later I found out he was married to Jesse Coulter and.  All right.  Bill, what's up?  Yikes.  Bill. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, John.  I want to thank you guys for getting the gay out of the show today.  Okay.  But, um, I want to ask her, this is a movie, Almost Famous, with T.  Hutchins.  I mean, does her life like kind of relate to that kind of movie if she ever saw it?  Well, that, that move, that girl, the character was pretty much based around me.  Yeah.  That character was pretty much based around myself.  Yeah.  Are you like the.  I am the very famous.  I'm the famous.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think.  I am the groupie.  You all fucking, like other groupie girls, like 20 go, oh my God.  Yes.  That's me. 
[02:26:00]  That's me.  That's me.  Are you serious?  Yeah, right.  I'm with the band.  And I'm reading tonight in New York.  Yeah.  Any advice to like new groupies out there?  How do they get backstage?  Well, now, now you sort of have to be in the business.  You have to, you know, be a disc jockey.  You have to like, we're going to be a publicist or, yeah.  Or, you know, a journalist.  It's very difficult to meet the big guns these days.  You can meet the local bands, smaller bands.  Right.  And that's a good way to speak.  Anybody can fuck the bass player. 
[02:26:30]  But to get to Mick.  It's not even so much the bass player.  Bass players are difficult now, too.  If they're in Green Day, how do you get to them?  It's very hard to do.  In your season, what was your heyday?  Your heyday.  Early 70s.  Early 70s.  Late 60s.  Pre-AIDS.  Oh, yeah.  I had a blast.  Shit.  No condoms.  No, I didn't have to even worry.  Any kids?  Any of that.  Dang it.  I have a son.  Yeah.  Who's is he?  My husband.  I got married for a long time.  Wow.  Yeah.  And who is he?  Michael DeBarre. 
[02:27:00]  He's on this new show called The Four Kings.  He's on right now.  He's playing a Phil Spector, British version of Phil Spector.  It's so funny.  So he's doing real well.  All right.  Let's go to McFly, the trucker.  McFly.  Hey, I'd like to ask Pamela, first off, on a scale of one to two,  10, how would you rate Waylon?  And two, what was the time you was dating Waylon there?  What time frame there year-wise?  I was dating Waylon, or seeing Waylon.  Yeah, you got to say seeing.  There was no dating going on.  They weren't looking at you as a girlfriend. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, come on.  They were too.  They really were.  God, yes, they were.  And she was really just seeing him, looking through the window.  I see you, Waylon.  Pam, could you get the fuck out of here, please?  No, they loved me.  69 to 71.  They had girlfriend experiences with you one day at a time.  69 to 71.  And he was married to Jesse during that time?  No, Jimmy Page wasn't my boyfriend, okay?  Okay?  All right?  I have a feeling she's a classy fucking...  69 to 71, I saw Waylon.  And Jesse didn't...  In fact, Shooter Jennings is a good friend of mine, 
[02:28:00]  and he told me that two weeks before his dad passed on,  he started talking about me again.  And Jesse came in and said,  shut up, Waylon.  So she definitely knew about me.  And I was a girlfriend of his.  Thank you.  They were one to ten.  How would you rate Waylon compared to all your other flings?  He was pretty hot, but I've got to tell you,  at the time, he was on speed.  So he could not finish.  It would go on forever.  I've been there, done that, spread it, and done a test.  Who gave the best head? 
[02:28:30]  Jimmy Page.  Really?  That's Jimmy Page.  What an artist.  Yeah, Jimmy, she loved it.  An artist in the bed, an artist on the stage,  using that tongue like he's playing a Zeppelin solo.  Oh, yeah.  You need balls.  Did he try to get a little weird  and pull out like a bow from a violin every so often?  Let the cliff beat down upon my nose.  With other girls he did, but not with me.  I was the good girl.  Yeah.  Was he inspiration for any of his stuff? 
[02:29:00]  Probably.  Delicious.  Is Robert Plant, was that really his package  in those jeans and those posters?  Yes.  Wow.  I know girls who have been with him.  Yeah, he is definitely happening.  He's got the big Robert Plant dick in there.  What a pleasant dish.  Robert Plant and the eggplant in his pants.  Robert Plant is the hottest.  He is still the hottest guy.  I toured with him recently.  I went to a few of his gigs because we're old friends.  The girls, all ages, just freaking out.  Still throwing themselves out.  And he's still so, just the way he holds himself and everything, 
[02:29:30]  he's a rock god.  Did you get the write-off on this book from all the people  that you mentioned name by name?  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  I know, but I'm saying to have people not hate you and shit.  No, no one got mad at me.  I told the truth.  These guys love, why do you think they are up there showing off?  They love to be talked about.  Who's the last big rock star kind of guy you were with?  Was it the 80s or something?  It was Keith Moon because, no, it was earlier than that.  Wow, really?  I met my ex-husband in 74.  Okay, so Keith Moon was my, I was seeing Waylon and Keith Moon 
[02:30:00]  at the same time.  Actually, I saw Waylon for longer.  Yeah.  I saw him until 74.  Wow.  Let's go to Mike in Baltimore.  Mike.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Pamela.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I've had your book for a long time.  Great, great read.  I want to ask you, who was the biggest asshole that you were with?  Hmm.  You know, they just weren't assholes to me.  I got to be honest with you.  I didn't have asshole experiences.  Well, Jimmy Page was, I don't know, Jimmy Page was the best and the worst  because he did actually wind up leaving me for a 14-year-old girl. 
[02:30:30]  Because you loved Jimmy Page.  Yes, I did.  For a 14-year-old.  14, yeah.  How old was he?  He was 26, I guess, maybe at the time.  25.  How long did he date her for?  Probably four years.  Couple of years.  No, a couple of years, too.  A couple of years.  You know, she was another one of the girls, Laurie Maddox.  She's in my new book that, you know, he saw for a couple of years  and broke her heart, too.  Oh, my God.  She was with a nine-year-old.  Left her for B.B. Buel.  Jimmy laid it down.  Jimmy fucking out-fucked all those rock stars, man.  Yeah, he's notorious.  Oh, he fucking blasted her because she can't get it. 
[02:31:00]  It's like, so who was the biggest asshole?  So who had the worst breath?  Jimmy.  Who cooked the best food?  Jimmy Page.  Well, how about Mick Jagger?  Fuck this faggot.  I don't like him.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I have to go.  I have another appointment, unfortunately, because I didn't plan on this.  This is so much fun.  Yeah, they were telling us through the window that you had to go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But thanks for having me.  Can I mention that I'm reading tonight at Enid's in Brooklyn  and tomorrow night at the Coliseum Books in Manhattan. 
[02:31:30]  I'd love to have people come down and meet me and hang out.  Okay.  Be fun.  Have a good read.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pamela.  Bye.  Bye.  Pamela DeBar, everyone.  Look at Patrice taking a look.  Yeah, it's a heavy door.  There you go.  There you go.  Carlos Mencia checking in.  What's up, Carlos?  Oh, you should see the kind of groupies I get the fuck.  She's trying to claim that she was a girlfriend to all these guys?  Stop.  Well, I don't think girlfriend in the way that they're, you know, let's go to the movies. 
[02:32:00]  She wanted people to make sure she wasn't doing one-night stands with these guys.  What's the difference?  She was, but what was making her good, you could tell.  I don't care if it's still on outside.  I had a problem with the fact that she thought she wasn't doing one-night stands.  I think the difference is they probably-  She did one-night stands multiple times with these guys.  She was a trooper.  They called her and hung out.  They probably called her, because I know girls that you just bang.  And then there's girls that are like, man, I really want to see this girl again when I'm in that city.  They trusted her.  She was a trusted hoe.  I understand that.  Derek goes, he whispers in my headphones, it's still on outside. 
[02:32:30]  She could hear this.  I don't care.  She was a trusted hoe.  I don't care about the fact that she's saying she was an actual girlfriend with all these guys.  You don't get side pussy opes, so you don't understand this, that getting a fucking hoe that doesn't snitch, man, is very important.  She was an important part of that group.  The word went out.  They used to go, hey, man, if you want to have a good time in the city or wherever this bitch was, go call Pam the bro.  She'll suck your dick.  She'll chill out.  She won't fuck with your life.  I get it.  And I think some of the guys were probably. 
[02:33:00]  That's what it was, but she was trying to make it sound like it was different than that.  Some of the guys probably were actual boyfriend for whatever period of time.  Maybe a couple, but she named a bunch of names and we barely got started with her.  Maybe there's a different definition of boyfriend.  And she also said she didn't go with the married guys.  Come on.  Come on.  What do I know?  That's her word.  You never know.  She might have an ethic.  The bitch has an outstanding reputation in the groupie community.  Anyone would write her a reference. 
[02:33:30]  You know?  Yeah, I hear you.  She's well loved.  You've got to love her.  English guys as well.  All English guys.  They're just popping through America and banging their wife out of her.  Nobody gives a shit about they were all English guys with their uncircumcised dicks.  What's they're doing?  Just banging them all the way through America.  English dicks all smell like feet.  Oh, God.  Nobody cares.  You've got octopus tentacle dicks.  You fucking awful fucking English dicks.  I'm a helmet self.  I'm a German helmet self.  I'm with anybody. 
[02:34:00]  All English guys.  Nobody cares.  Carlos, what do we got going on, man?  Nothing wrong with the little cheese with your weenie, guys.  What the fuck's wrong with you guys?  What's wrong with uncircumcised dicks?  What, a peeler?  The burrito?  You don't got no uncircumcised dicks, Carlos.  Somebody would say that.  No, yeah.  I'm not circumcised.  I'm a banter, dude.  Of course.  No, he's saying he's got a banana peel there.  The Mexicans don't circumcise.  The Mexicans don't circumcise.  No.  No, they don't circumcise.  Fuck what?  The dick of Mencia. 
[02:34:30]  The dick of Mencia.  My dick's got a hood, dude.  My dick looks like it's about to commit a felony, dude.  That's what my shit looks like.  Dick is a racist.  Got a little hoodie on.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like the father from Mork and Mindy wearing a scarf around his mouth.  Wow.  Got a little burning cross on you and everything.  Holy shit.  Staring all the clipped dicks.  You got about to rub the blood, put it in it to batches.  I don't need no fucking batches.  And it goes in, baby.  I got to take a piss.  I got to take a piss tomorrow.  I got to start rolling back my dick. 
[02:35:00]  I think it's only America that has it.  Only America has it.  Yeah, I don't want no fucking dickwit.  It's because of bitches, man.  You don't want no ugly fucking foreskin.  That's what your mama do immediately, get rid of that ugly mess.  You got to take a piss, and it's like putting a convertible top down on your car.  It takes all kinds of time and effort.  And you got to treat your dick like a pussy.  Like a vagina.  You got to keep it clean like a vagina.  Everything's on the outside.  You just scrub a dub-dub in the shower.  You're done.  You're not peeling back tab A and certain tabs B, slots C. 
[02:35:30]  Like a convertible top.  Man, that is so good.  All right, I got to pull this over here.  Pull this over here.  You got to fucking cervix.  Pull this part out.  Pull that off.  Fucking fallopian tubes in your dick.  Nothing.  Where the fuck does this thing end?  Hey, if it was on your fucking nose, you'd get it cut off.  Everybody.  If everyone was born with like a fucking little elephant trunk on their nose, and a doctor  said, oh, we cut that off when you're born, everyone would do it.  Everybody.  You can't cover that shit up.  I got to roll my nose skin back to breathe.  Yeah, I got a cold.  There's snot in here now. 
[02:36:00]  It's pretty open.  Dried up in a crease.  Hiss all trapped in it.  Oh.  Carlos, you're getting killed.  Oh, fuck it.  Carlos is getting killed.  Oh, my God.  I've got a buddy who can actually put a half a pint of liquid in his foreskin and hold  it and shake it around.  Yeah, that how you cleaned it out?  That was awful.  It's a fucking thing, Jack.  It's pretty awful.  You think I got a gargle?  Hey.  There's some Listerine in there.  Hey, I broke my cock.  There's an air cast on it.  Listen, fellas, we're going on Saturday.  You got to let me know on Wednesday because I got to start cleaning my dick. 
[02:36:30]  He's going to...  He's dying.  Enough of a luffagus.  What's going on, Carlos?  Oh, man, no shit.  Hey, I just want to hear, buddy.  You know, I've always get complaints that I don't go to the East Coast, so I'm going  to be actually at House of Blues in Atlantic City in a couple of weeks.  So, there you go.  There aren't that many tickets left. 
[02:37:00]  Go get them.  There.  I'm done.  Let me tell you.  You go see my uncircumcised convertible pullback after 20 years.  Aunt Eater.  I love that, my Aunt Eater.  God, he called in for just a nice, quick, innocent plug, and he just got ambushed.  Nobody wants...  Nobody...  No girl wants to suck a cock that smells like a Reuben.  Oh, my God.  Take...  Oh, fuck it.  So, make sure everybody go see Carlos in Atlantic City at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[02:37:30]  House of Blues.  Oh, House of Blues in Atlantic City.  Him and his civil rights dick.  Hosing down Negroes.  Don't be waiting, black man.  Don't be waiting.  Fucking...  That end of the auric vacuum cleaner cock.  That eight-pound cock.  Let me tell you this goes everywhere after sex.  Oh, my God.  Might not be clean, but it could pluck ants out of an ant hole. 
[02:38:00]  Fucking find a nickel behind the head when you pull it back.  Like a fucking purse.  There's a vellament stuck to it.  They are just awful.  When's the date in Atlantic City, Carlos?  What is the fucking date?  Two weeks from this weekend, whatever that date is.  All right.  I don't even know, man. 
[02:38:30]  It's two weeks from today, actually.  Hey, I apologize, by the way.  You called me during the Islander Ranger game last night at the Coliseum.  I couldn't pick up my phone.  Joe Rogan was on the line.  Oh, it's all good.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, no.  Actually, yeah, Joe Rogan.  I didn't want to click over.  I don't know.  That motherfucker, Ned, should be playing hockey, that cracker.  But you called during the game, and I couldn't pick up.  It was too loud at the Coliseum last night.  No, it's all good, man.  It's worth you guys fucking calling my dick an orange, an auric vacuum cleaner. 
[02:39:00]  Did you do an...  No, you don't understand.  I'm going to go upstairs right now, pull it out, and tell my wife,  does this shit taste like a ribbon?  Have some Danish, babe, but wait, let me pull it back.  Well, you should be able to answer that question, though.  I mean, is she doing that a lot?  If she's not doing that a lot to you, then there's a problem.  Yeah, it kind of answers itself.  It's a question that answers itself.  If you have a cut dick, it is so much easier to see where the problem is.  If you're uncut, and you fuck somebody in the ass, 
[02:39:30]  you've got to clean it like toothpaste.  You've got to squeeze it.  From your balls.  From your balls.  All the way to the fucking...  Get the sweet corn from them.  No, you've got to get one of those fucking rollers that you need bread with.  Oh, bread, roll up.  Slap your dick on the table.  Playing the Italian cook music in the back.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I've got to clean my dick. 
[02:40:00]  You're going to clean your dick and have it look like space food.  Quarter pound of cookie dough on the table and you're finished.  We treat our...  We treat our friends horribly, man.  Of course we do.  I like the fact that the hardest thing to you guys is the fact,  oh, you've got to clean that thing.  Yeah, you take a shower, you peel it back, you get in.  See, that's the thing, Carlos.  That's the problem.  That little small little detail of pulling it back.  That's what makes us different from hoes. 
[02:40:30]  It's like we don't have to pull no skin back.  It's just like wash your dirty dick.  It almost...  That skin makes you respect your dick.  No one wants to respect their dick when they're cleaning it.  Just watch that motherfucker.  Part of your leg.  It's a part of your leg.  It's a part of my leg.  I just lather up the whole seam down there.  Cleaning your cock should never have a step two.  It should be...  You should be able to fucking jerk off and clean it in the exact same moment.  It doesn't, though, what you do... 
[02:41:00]  Once you get to the tip, you go all the way back and it's done.  Skin's already...  I mean, you don't have one, so you don't...  It's not that much fucking skin, guys.  You guys are acting like it's an elephant here.  You guys are acting like it's like,  holy shit, let me get all this out of the way.  Holy shit, it's not fucking bad.  It's just about, I don't know, half...  Not even half an inch of extra shit there, man.  It's just something evolution hasn't gotten rid of yet. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Because back when people had to, like, fight with rocks over a bison burger...  Yeah.  ...their dicks would probably get scraped up on the ground.  You don't want the head of your dick, which is the most sensitive part,  scraping on rocks.  To protect it gets warm.  It was a warm...  It was...  It was a warm...  A warm...  And it'd lava rock at you and it'd hit the tip of your dick.  That would hurt us.  You don't want your dick to get caught in the saber-toothed tiger.  Right.  And to be fair, you don't need to get rid of it. 
[02:42:00]  There is no medical reason to get rid of it.  Yes, you do.  It's because it makes people sick.  I'm just saying.  I'm just trying to...  I'm just...  I'm trying to...  I'm trying to be on your side with your alien dick.  You ever watch an uncut guy coming?  It looks like a caterpillar spinning a fucking cocoon.  Dude, keep going with it.  Your helmet looks like a miner trying to...  All right, let Carlos get in here for a second. 
[02:42:30]  Carlos.  No, I'm going to use that Aryan Nazi cock thing.  That is shit, man.  German helmets.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Carlos, always a pleasure.  That's the funniest shit I ever heard, man.  I've been farted, but that was the best.  That was fucking awesome.  All right.  All right.  We're Atlantic City. 
[02:43:00]  House of Blues.  Two weeks.  Yeah.  Doesn't anybody have a calendar there?  What's two weeks from Friday?  Calendar.  From today, I guess...  Let me do the math.  17th, maybe?  Yeah, there you go.  Okay.  Perfect.  Beautiful.  All right.  Maybe we'll come down and see you in Atlantic City.  That would be cool, actually.  Yeah, come down, guys.  I haven't seen you guys in a while.  Like, outside of the studio.  Hey, mind a Mencia?  Second season?  Yeah, March 22nd.  We already started.  Great.  What did we shoot yesterday that was really awesome? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  We opened up a drive-by shooting range so that gangbangers don't know any suggestions anymore.  That was funny.  So we put them in cars, and we got, like, an actual course with pop-up dolls and little  kids that come out.  It's funny, dude.  It's fucking funny, man.  That's great.  That's kind of needed in real life.  Drive-by shooting range.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we don't care when they kill themselves, right?  No, no one cares.  It's always some, oh, my child was walking down the road. 
[02:44:00]  Some pain-in-the-ass innocent bystander gets shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So that's what we want to help.  We know that we're not going to stop drive-by shootings, but we can help them get better  aim.  So that's what we shot that yesterday.  Tilting the gun 90 degrees counterclockwise might help with their aim.  Yeah, we did that with the bandana.  What was the best, the funniest thing we shot yesterday?  I think the funniest thing we shot was we taught this guy because he was talking, he would  talk shit before he did the drive-by. 
[02:44:30]  So right before he would shoot, he'd be like, motherfucker, I'm here.  And then he'd yell out the name of whoever it was.  And by the time he shot, everybody was ducking or running.  Yeah, they got to talk shit.  So the guy would shut the fuck up before he shoots.  It's like, shoot, then talk shit.  Yeah, drive-bys are those just walk-up shootings.  You can't just do it.  You got to say, yeah, motherfucker, turn the gun sideways, yeah, motherfucker, this is  four, and then, you know, recite what the hell, and by that time his buddies are out  there.  Yeah, just shoot, man. 
[02:45:00]  Just fucking shoot.  I was thinking that Carlos Mancilla needs to be part of Super Bowl next year.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wait, what are you guys doing on Super Bowl?  Well, no, we had an incredible competition yesterday where guys were abusing their nutsack  with mousetraps.  Maybe he could start now.  Oh, the wasps can nest in his foreskin, and he'll have a whole colony by next year.  And then we had guys getting stung in the nutsack by bees yesterday on the show.  Oh.  First for radio.  Oh.  Yeah, it was quite a sight. 
[02:45:30]  You want me to pull out the Gila monster?  Yeah.  See how many mousetraps we can get on that thing.  The record is six.  All right.  Carlos, thank you.  We'll see you in the Atlantic City House of Blues two weeks from today.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Carlos Mancilla, everyone.  Thanks, Carlos.  That's funny.  What's more fun than talking about uncircumcised penises?  I don't think anything.  Very fun.  It's as fun as that.  Hey, speaking of Super Bowl, remember we were just talking about how the show just ended? 
[02:46:00]  Uh-huh.  And we want people to take that audio where it just ends and do something with it.  Yep.  Whether you continue the show or use that audio that did make it on the air and enhance it.  Mm-hmm.  Well, we got a couple that came in already.  Well, from our guys.  We got one from Danny and one from Than.  So, wow.  Already.  Hey, some examples.  The listeners are going to try to do something with this as well.  The back motors of the ship are just holding it.  For the final, Matt. 
[02:46:30]  You are the final, Matt.  That's a good job. 
[02:47:00]  Very good.  Danny.  That was Danny?  Yeah, that was Danny.  Bravo.  Danny.  Also looking for people to, you know, where the audio stops then continue with something  maybe, all right?  Mm-hmm.  Here's Than.  Than came up with this one a little earlier.  Oh, my God.  The whole nest is a great second last in the show.  What courage.  This is for the title, Matt.  You are a madman.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You should have to pay for it. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, you shouldn't have to pay for it now.  Oh, great.  Yeah, that is typical fan.  Very good.  Oh, those are the first two.  I think we're going to get a lot of them.  Very, very good.  And it's going to be, believe me, all downhill from there.  Those are going to be the two best.  Yes.  I don't see us getting sent from listeners.  One's better than that.  No.  That's funny.  Do you want to take credit for those, E-Rock?  Oh, shit.  No.  I screw them up by saying E-Rock found this.  Oh, shit.  Oh, okay.  Because you said it, and they were in there going, no, that was us.  No, what it was was there was a, it doesn't matter. 
[02:48:00]  There was a diss.  It doesn't matter.  Talking about video whores.  Yeah.  And one of the cuts happened to have a cut of Superhead.  Uh-huh.  So all I'm saying is, Than put that whole show together on disc, and we were going to goof  on it or whatever, but when Patrice mentioned Superhead, E-Rock remembered, oh, my God,  we have a clip on this disc.  That's all.  Oh, okay.  So I said E-Rock found it, meaning he grabbed the disc and highlighted that we do have that  audio.  That's all.  I just saw Than's arms go up in the air.  That's not all about credit, though.  I mean, good job finding that stuff, and good job putting those two clips together. 
[02:48:30]  They started the credit thing.  We used to just go, ah, fuck it, and just do our show, but now we realize everyone needs  credit.  Yeah.  We would just take credit for everything.  I know.  It used to be fun.  We sounded like geniuses because we took so much credit.  All right.  A couple other things before break.  The Emily Stern things.  Yeah.  Just out of hand.  We're getting...  We have another...  We just went through a batch of...  How many did we get?  I went through a batch of 27 this morning.  Jesus.  We have two that we can play today. 
[02:49:00]  And then Steve just handed me another disc with another 30.  30.  That we have to go through.  Steve, how are they?  Most of them stink on ice.  Yeah.  A lot of them stink.  Some of them...  I like this on ice thing.  On ice.  On ice.  Because we really have to stink.  On ice.  In order to be stink on ice.  Nothing worse than stinking on the rocks.  Right.  There you go.  You want to suck just straight.  So we got two that came in.  We got this one from Sacramento.  This is Ty.  His Emily Stern remix.  Listen to this.  Oh.  Hold on. 
[02:49:30]  That's the girl what she wanted to be.  She said, baby...  My kids are godly.  I'm going to be famous.  A star with a scream.  But you can do something in between.  Maybe you can drop...  Am I trying now?  Yes, I'm going to be a star.  Baby, you can drop my joy now. 
[02:50:00]  Baby, I love you.  And it just goes on from there.  It's really long.  That's very funny.  We're trying to do like Web Junk 20 and just give you a little piece of the action here.  A little taste.  And this one really made me laugh really hard.  It's Quiet Rider and Son James.  Came up with this Emily Stern remix today.  Listen to this one.  Vagina. 
[02:50:30]  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  My breast, my breast.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Very good, Bonanza. 
[02:51:00]  We'll just fade out there because it keeps going.  Very, very good job.  We're going to have to put an end to this, I think.  Oh, my.  We'll accept Emily Stern remixes until Monday, 
[02:51:30]  and then we'll do some kind of contest.  We'll play the top five or something and just end the bit finally.  Yeah, finally put the bit to rest.  But we have another 30 we've got to listen to to see what makes the radio or not.  How creative with the same frigging, like, three clips.  I know.  The listeners really come to the table.  I was distracted by that magazine.  I saw the biggest black talk going into.  I just saw.  This is exactly what.  Here's the fear.  This is exactly what the civil rights movement is about.  That's exactly what the fear of white people is. 
[02:52:00]  That is not.  Let me see that.  That's a real dick.  She's got a great awesome shit.  Yeah.  Too bad it's being fucking ruined by a tree trunk.  There's a picture in Buttman magazine, of course, of me with some girls.  And then there's a picture on one of the pages of a black guy.  His tripod.  It's fucking a girl in the ass.  A blonde-haired, lovely girl. 
[02:52:30]  And it's obscene how big his cock is.  Anthony's handing over the magazine to me.  I'm like, I can see it from here.  Yeah.  You really don't need to.  Thank God.  I don't need to get any closer.  That's our reparation.  It really is.  Jesus.  Lost word.  Rip.  It really looks like someone just put a nice white ass over Manute Bull's head.  40 acres and a mule-sized cock going in a white woman.  That's the reparation.  40 acres and a donkey dick.  That is reparation.  It sure is. 
[02:53:00]  Tearing up that right.  Can we say after that photo, paid in full, please?  Wow.  Can we just write off the bill now, paid in full?  I mean, I believe in integration, but I would love to see white only over that ass.  You don't want to follow that.  White sovereignly.  Man.  Oh, is that a fucking massive hug?  I was just handing broke back mountain clips.  I don't know what's going on with this.  What is it?  Does Steve know?  I'm sure.  Of course he does.  I'm sure he knows.  These were just a few of my favorites. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  Steve doesn't like that.  What?  No.  I'm just going along with it.  Grr.  You don't like it.  He doesn't like that.  What?  Grr.  Grr.  I need headphones.  We got our first piece of audio from somebody in Holland.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, actually we did.  Oh, okay.  Mark from Holland?  Yeah, he's listening online.  Holland.  He sent in a broke back, a mock broke back trailer.  Is that where they wear the wooden shoes?  Yes.  The clogs.  Is he in big wooden shoes right now living in a windmill? 
[02:54:00]  Windmill.  And there's tulips outside the windmill?  Is that all I know about Holland?  Smoking a big spliff.  Yeah.  Using a windmill to Powers XM.  Powers XM with the windmill?  That'd be funny gosh.  Aren't that a cocoa drink?  Oh, that's Swiss.  That's different, right?  Yeah.  No, it's all the same.  It is, right?  They're all the same over there.  Don't they skate in the canals too or something like that in the winter?  And they only skate with both hands behind their back.  Like Hans Christian Andersen.  Wow.  I'm serious.  In the winter, they use those canals to commute to work. 
[02:54:30]  They throw skates on and then skate down the canals.  They're like some kind of Opie over there.  There you go.  Only they commute in the winter and you commute on rollerblades in the summer.  I'm just completely fucking torching a country.  He's like, don't they skate?  He just made that up.  They skate on the canals?  I know they skate on the canals.  When the fuck?  It's him on my cuff.  I know.  Me and Gavin are looking at each other.  I pay attention every once in a while.  Someone help me out.  They skate down the canals in the winter and that's how they commute to work. 
[02:55:00]  It never gets that cold.  Sweden probably.  Yeah.  It doesn't get that cold.  What, brother?  I don't know.  Somebody's doing it somewhere.  He's just tossing out information.  He's more northern than that.  Wait, isn't that where they drink cocoa and fuck children?  I don't know if I'm going to have people planning trips.  Hey, it's got to be true because I've got a microphone in front of me.  We have learned that if you have a microphone in front of you, you can say whatever you want  and you're an expert at that subject.  People will be planning.  Hey, you want to go to Holland in December?  You know they skate on the canals. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, man.  You're setting me up for some awful photoshops later on.  Sorry, man.  Good evening.  I'm touched on skies.  All right, here's Brokeback Mountain from Mark from Holland doing something with the  trailer.  Right.  Is it funny?  It's from Holland.  We're only playing this because it's from Holland?  We try to play stuff that's funny or interesting.  You know what?  I was too busy going through the 30 fucking drunk clips and the 30 Emily Stern remises.  He doesn't want to take responsibility in case it's not.  No.  You know what?  Give me all the responsibility.  I'll accept full responsibility even though I didn't make it.  We do have 30 drunk audio clips. 
[02:56:00]  You know what?  Go ahead.  Play it.  It could suck for all I know.  Oh, shit.  Go through Holland.  Holland.  Nominated for a shitload of Oscars, the movie that tells the story about forbidden love  between two gay cowboys.  Well, I got to tell you, that's a mighty fine and good looking horse you got there, buddy.  Why, thank you.  Your horse doesn't look too bad either.  Two seconds later. 
[02:56:30]  Put it right there, buddy.  Shove it in.  Brokeback Mountain.  This clip.  A beautiful moon story coming to a theater near you.  It's Holland, though.  We got to vote on a curve.  I think for Holland, it's really funny.  That's awful for commercial radio in 1977.  Did you pick up on the accent, though?  That was interesting.  I was too busy ugh-ing internally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was no interest in that whatsoever. 
[02:57:00]  That was awful.  Holland, um...  That's quite a horse you got there, buddy.  I get it.  Well, we got another one that came in.  Oh, thank God.  We didn't even ask for these.  Which shit country is this from?  I don't know.  Stop it, Nasty.  Come on.  It's from Big Rock Candy Mountain.  Right.  That was what I got.  One evening as his cum went down  And my blue knot hairs were burning  Down the track came a homo hiking 
[02:57:30]  He said, boys, I'm just yearning  I'm looking for a lad who likes to sway  Beside the homo fountain  So come in me and we'll go to sea  Brokeback Faggot Mountain  In Brokeback Faggot Mountain  The land is full of cocks  No girls with nice little bushes  With men sleeping in their jocks  Vaginas are all empty 
[02:58:00]  And male ass shining bright  Where Enos and Jack are playing with my sack  Tickling my hole in deep, you know  On the Brokeback Faggot Mountain  On the Brokeback Faggot Mountain  Turn it off!  All the sheep have warm wet twats  And cowboys are so funny  But that doesn't matter much  Cause the cowboys in Wyoming  Are so goddamn gay 
[02:58:30]  Is that supposed to be sexy?  That's horrible.  What is that one from?  What?  That was the no whammies, no whammies, no whammies  Press your luck, right?  Press your luck  Oh, the whammy  And then they do a little dance  To make it all fun  That you just lost a bunch of money  Horrid game  Thanks for those, Steve  You're welcome  They were terrific  Thank you  Yeah  Alright, we gotta take a break  Break 
[02:59:00]  Jason Fisher's here  Very cool  He's playing Lenny Bruce  I wanna go see that play  I went the other night  It was unbelievable  Really?  It's good?  He was great as Lenny Bruce  He'll talk about that next for us  We should, by the way, point out to him  That Rich Voss played Lenny Bruce, too  Voss?  In what?  American Dreams, it's called  Right, I remember that  Voss called me  He wanted to get dinner or something  Or he wanted to critique his latest appearance on the show  Just the stupid shit you have to deal with with Voss 
[02:59:30]  When you're a friend of his  It's unbelievable  I thought I was pretty good on the show  I don't care if you were good on the show or not  I played Lenny Bruce  I wasn't that bad  So, he's like  You wanna get social?  And I'm like  I'm going to see this Lenny Bruce play  And he got really pissed off  That someone else actually was playing Lenny Bruce  Oh, they didn't call him up?  What?  Yeah, that's what I was getting at  Like, you could tell over the phone  That he's really pissed  That his agent didn't call him for the Lenny Bruce role  And he has nothing in common with Lenny Bruce  Other than the fact that he's older than Lenny would have been 
[03:00:00]  He has nothing in common with Lenny Bruce  Lenny Bruce died, like, 40 years ago  He would have been 80  In 60, uh  66, he died  I'm just giving info, Patrice  Oh, no  What did I do now?  Nothing  Oh, go ahead, just kidding  And the funny thing is, Voss  If you remember that  It was one role  I remember Voss was  He used to walk around asking everybody  Can you help me with this role? 
[03:00:30]  And all he had to do was go  Watch out  That was his whole line  That was his lines  They probably had more  But you know, they're all on the cutting room floor  Like, what the fuck is this guy doing?  No cutting room  Just absolutely  Voss is maybe the third worst actor I've ever seen  Oh, all right  And I haven't seen the other two  But I'm not going to say he's the worst  There's got to be someone out there  You just don't know him  There's got to be two other more worst  We're all leaving some room  I wouldn't call him the worst actor  Simply because you can't even classify that as acting  It's something  He's there  Can we get him doing Lenny Bruce?  It's something  Does anyone have a copy of that? 
[03:01:00]  Because we were off the air when Voss played Lenny Bruce  We've got to get that audio  You know how you rate Voss?  You don't rate him against other actors  You rate him against children that are pretending to do something  Like a child that pretends to be a king or a cowboy  You rate him against refrigerator paintings that your kid gets  Oh, that was good Voss  Good  It's three awful stick figures with a little sun in the upper corner  Brian 
[03:01:30]  Yeah  What's up?  I wanted to see if you guys wanted to listen on Bill Burr and on Mancow  Oh, Bill Burr's on Mancow right now?  Oh, yeah?  Sure  What's going on there?  He's talking about trying out the new automated checking machines at the airport  And swiping his passport instead of his credit card  Do you have a radio going there?  Yeah  We'll put it down there  Yeah, maybe we can hear some Bill Burr  You can get to the stadium with me for the big day 
[03:02:00]  Um, I wouldn't see whether there would be a problem  What other kinds of candy can you recommend for the big day?  Um, we just have like a lot  Is this a prank phone call?  Is this a prank call?  I'm from England and I'm used to eating walk-a-boss  This free radio is terrific  This is terrific stuff 
[03:02:30]  I guess they're calling Detroit  And it goes right into a promo  No, because in free radio you've got to end every break with a bang  Right, bang  A big line that gets a laugh and then  Why don't we do that?  Why don't we start a bit with a laugh?  We try to go to break with something interesting 
[03:03:00]  But this is the formula in free radio  Where you have to get a big laugh and then you can hit the spots  For old times sakes, why don't you guys do a free radio show once on this network?  Yeah, that would be rough  Actually, I'm here to all FCC regulations  Dump out  Play commercials  Not only do we not end with laughs, we don't even end with a real thought  Here's how it ends  Um, alright, Eric's gonna look for that thing  And, um, hey Derek, take us out  Because we're gonna see if we can get some of this stuff together for the next time 
[03:03:30]  Worst idea ever  Why don't you just ask Anthony  Hey, hey, hey, why don't you go on a date with your, uh, your ex-wife  Oh, that's brilliant  Just for fun  Just to see if it's  Uh, no  Hey, fair enough  Fuck me, nigga  Oh, there's a big laugh  Hit the spot  Dump out  Dump out  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon  A true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess  Oh, not again  Ramone 
[03:04:00]  Wash my balls  That's right  It's the Opie and Anthony program  XM Satellite Radio  Patrice O'Neill in studio  You stopped by to say hi  And you forgot Sweetie Pie Gavin  And Gavin, yeah  Oh, muscular  Oh, muscular  Gavin looks like he would be a problem  Oh, he's a fucking major problem  As you like to say  Even in that fucking tight sweater 
[03:04:30]  Gavin is a  What's up, Todd?  Is it too late?  Gavin is a major problem  He's a major problem, yeah  Excuse me  People on PalTalk see him?  Yeah  All right  Have him just stand up next to somebody that's, uh  How about me?  Like normal size?  Yeah  Yeah, just stand up, Gavin, for the pal talk  This is how big this fucking dude is  Yeah, there he is compared to Jimmy  Look at how insane that is  This is my worst nightmare  I've committed a crime  The judge is making an example out of me  Did you ever want to wrestle or anything, Gavin? 
[03:05:00]  None of that crap?  I played, uh, I played professional rugby back home for  Professional rugby?  Holy shit  Rugby, what a pussy game  Here's how big and tough Gavin is  He was my bodyguard in Philly  Yeah  Like, out of nowhere, he just jumped up  He was, like, I was getting all kind of trouble  From those sociopaths  Yeah  And, uh, Gab just decided he was my bodyguard  Out of nowhere, just out of instinct  Right  Nobody fucked with, fuck  People was fucking with me  Saw him, it was over  Does he have the stories?  Like, have you kicked people's asses? 
[03:05:30]  No comment  Yeah, he's just shaking his head  Are you one of these guys that doesn't have to work out?  No, I work out  You just got the genes  No, I work out a lot  I work out  You go to the gym once a month and  The muscles just pop  No, I use a lot of food, actually  So, unfortunately, if I don't work out, I'll be as fat as  Yeah  Well, you know, Gab and stuff  This is the first time I knew Gab and stuff  He doesn't talk about punching  His first instinct is to headbutt you  Yeah  That's perfectly shaved head  Like Glasgow kick  Just bamming into your forehead  You would get me out so bad 
[03:06:00]  He explains why  That's all they do at back home  That's all the Scotchers do  They headbutt you  He explains why it's dangerous  He explains why it's dangerous  He goes, mate  Your head weighs 18 pounds, mate  Like, your head is half your body weight  No, your head is actually 30 body weight  So, it's the best weapon you've got  Your elbows and your head  A lot heavier than a fist  Ask Poe Poe, I'd tell you  Yeah  Smash your head  We gotta say hi to Jason Fisher  Hey, Jason, how are you?  What's up, man?  It's a crazy, crazy day in here  I'm sorry we made you wait out there 
[03:06:30]  It's all right, man  It's all right  Yeah  What's up?  I'm tired, man  Yeah, what is this?  Getting up so early, right?  Man, I'm fucking exhausted, man  But, you know, I'm happy to be here  What time do you do your shows?  Eight, eight o'clock  Eight?  Yeah  So, it's  You're a sleep all day guy, right?  Yeah, I like sleep  And then you can stay up kind of late at night  Oh, yeah  And then I'm a little  After the show  I'm a little wired after the show  And then I hang out  Yeah, and just kind of like, you know  Play a computer game  God damn, I miss afternoons 
[03:07:00]  I know  Because that's what it was all about  It was all about  You do your show in the afternoon  And then it ends in the early evening  You are out till all hours  It doesn't matter  If you can't be to work  By eight o'clock at night  You've got a problem  You've got a problem  You've got issues  You've got issues  It is perfect  And for us, three in the afternoon  I had to be to work at three in the afternoon  Yeah, no  You can't swing that up  You deserve to be homeless  I didn't even know what an alarm clock was  Until a year ago  No, you didn't need one  I actually went shopping for an alarm clock 
[03:07:30]  Like, people buy these things?  Now I got the best job in the world  And still, when that alarm goes off  And I sit on the edge of the bed for a minute  All that's coming out of my mouth is  Motherfucker  Shit  This fucking sucks  And then I'm just running through the commute in my head  And all kinds of other shit  You curse every morning, right?  Every morning  My alarm goes off  And I'm amazed by the curse words that come out of me immediately  And it's the greatest job in the world  I talk to myself  I'm like, this is my big one  Holy shit, you've got to be fucking kidding me  I say that every morning to myself  It's a good one  Yeah, I think you use that one 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, no, a little bit  A little bit, yeah, sometimes  You can curse  We're doing the satellite  I know  You used that one this morning  Okay, good  Yeah, you used that one this morning?  Cool  Do you stay in character when you're not on the stage?  A little bit, man  I mean, like a little  I mean, like the persecuted part  Yeah  You know, for sure  He's playing Lenny Bruce  Off-Broadway  I went the other night  It was amazing  Did you write this  Or is this something you auditioned for?  Yeah, I just auditioned, man  Yeah, just auditioned  It's called Lenny Bruce and His Own Words  And basically, he's doing Lenny Bits on stage, right?  Yeah, basically, yeah 
[03:08:30]  It's like all his own words  Is it exact?  Yeah  Every word that is said in it, he said  Do you have any comic background or anything?  Or an actor?  Oh, man, I'm an actor, man  So it's weird  See, that's odd  It is, man  I've seen a lot of actors attempt to do stand-up comedy in movies or whatever, TV  Yeah  And it comes off so poorly  Yeah  They just don't have it in them  This is different because it's kind of you playing  It's kind of both  It's not like you're just trying to do a stand-up  It's more capturing his whole persona 
[03:09:00]  That's the idea  Yeah  You know what I mean?  And I must say, but it is like stand-up  It's dependent on the audience for sure  I mean, if we have like a live crowd  And I go out there and have a good time  And everyone wants to have a good time  You know, it's like you  You have to like develop a relationship with the audience  Whereas when you're doing a play  You just go out there and you do your thing  And they watch  And if they like it  So like a stand-up comic  There are some nights you have like a beat audience  Oh, fuck yeah, man  And some nights you have a great audience  That is really odd  It is odd, man  It's a weird way to do that  Because like when the Phantom is playing  Every night  The guys pretty much know  They're going to like this 
[03:09:30]  Standing ovation  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You know, you might get a little variance in there  But to get there and be performing as Lenny Bruce  And then have a crowd that's like  Eh, come on, funny man  Make me fucking laugh  Oh, yeah  I got to tell you, it was creepy  Because I've seen enough Lenny Bruce on tape  And when you hit the stage, I'm like  Oh, my God, he's nailing it  Oh, thanks  I mean, you look younger than he was at the time  But besides that, you're nailing his mannerisms and everything  And he also has  You look like you're on pills or something on stage 
[03:10:00]  Just slightly  Like you're just coming off a little hangover or something  That's the thing, man  That subtle touch  I'm like, wow, that's what Lenny Bruce was doing every  I don't think that's him playing Lenny Bruce  I think that's him  Dude, I quit everything, man  Did you?  I quit everything to do this, man  Oh, to do this  Yeah  Like right before that audition  No, man, I'm sorry  It's like the opposite  I had to go the opposite way in order to be able to do it  And then all of a sudden he's on stage  And I know it was part of the play  And all of a sudden he forgets the bit  Like Lenny used to do  And then Lenny's trying to find his way back to where he was 
[03:10:30]  Like he's doing all that on stage  It was well, well done  Thank you, man  Thank you, yeah  Yeah, I gotta see this  Yeah, people seem to dig it  You know what I mean?  It's weird, you know?  It's like, yeah, there's different houses  You know, sometimes people are there to laugh  Sometimes people are there to watch a play  And, you know, it's in a theater  We did it in L.A.  It was in a nightclub  So when people get to a nightclub  They were eating this steak  And they were doing this  And they were doing that  So there wasn't as much sort of focus  On the guy in front of them  And, you know, it had more of that, like, verite feel  But we're in the theater in New York  So it's like you really gotta  You know, you really gotta engage them, like, flat out 
[03:11:00]  You know what I mean?  And you can't just be like  Oh, well, I'll dick around  And they'll do their thing  And then eventually something will happen  And they'll watch what they want to watch  And they'll listen to me  They can eat their steak  They're there and they're sitting there  And they're like, okay, you know, here comes the play  I'm in New York  You know what I mean?  And it's like, that can be a terrific thing  If I take the time to fucking look at them  Hey, how are you?  Actually deal with the people that are in front of me  You know what I'm saying?  I was so uncomfortable  And I gotta blow up your spot slightly  Like, all of a sudden  And you gotta walk us through this 
[03:11:30]  The first time you had to do this  When all of a sudden you had to, like, point at the audience and go  Alright, so how many niggers are out there tonight?  I went, oh my  I know you're acting  But I'm like, holy crap  Someone is gonna get pissed off  It doesn't matter that he's doing what Lenny Bruce did and all that  And it's based on Lenny Bruce's words  The first time you hit the stage  And you knew you had to do that  What was going through your head?  No, yeah, man  I mean, it was definitely, you know  I definitely am kind of like  It's like there's me being scared and being all, like, liberal  Because they also turn the lights on 
[03:12:00]  Just like, I guess, Lenny Bruce used to do  Alright, turn on the lights  And point out who's in the house  Yeah  And the bit is how he's pointing out all ethnic groups  Because then he goes, oh, there's a kike  There's a wop  There's this  There's that  But he starts with how many niggers are out there  I'm like, holy crap  Someone's gonna jump on the stage and hit him  I know  I mean, and the thing of it is  Is like, I gotta be honest with you  Like, the actor behind it all  Kind of, like, gets off on how uncomfortable it makes me feel to do it  Not really?  I'll be honest  I'd be lying if I said that wasn't true  But then you're actually pointing at black people 
[03:12:30]  But I'm not  But dude, no  Good attitude  Oh, you know what?  No, no, no  Then you blew it when I saw you  Because I was, like, one row behind a lovely couple  And it looked like you were pointing right at them  Maybe the lights were too bright  You didn't realize  It's like, I am and I'm not  And I, you know what I mean?  I gotta pretend  You know, whatever  But, like, no  I don't actually  You know, search me now  Hey, you  I can't  I can't do that  But, no, it makes me uncomfortable  But at the same time  I was like, wow  I know this is a play  But that has gotta be uncomfortable  But then where it goes  I think is really cool  Oh, yeah  Then it all makes sense 
[03:13:00]  Exactly  At first, it's the shock value  Like, oh, my God  He just said that  But that's what Lenny was doing  It's about what it's about  Removing the power of that awful word  You got it  You got it  It's like, yeah, exactly  He's like, you know  If nigger lost meaning  They didn't mean anything  You know what I mean?  I'm gonna say that word  That's a terrible word  It is a terrible word  That's XM Satellite  It's a terrible word  You should hear it  At the business meetings  Behind the scenes  They use it all the time  We all say it on certain days  Fucking terrible  And just listen to how  Fucking wonderful  Everybody feels  They can have this  Intelligent conversation 
[03:13:30]  And just say nigger  Just freely  Hey, man, you know  We're taking the power  Out of the word  Yeah, we're taking the power  Out of the word  Nigger  That's what's so great about  And, you know, you have to learn  To take the power  Out of the word  Coon and porch monkey  Any porch monkeys in the house?  Hey, man, that's the thing here  On XM  Where you can just  You can have a free  Now, do you get  Do you get  Real nervous when you say nigger?  And, no, I never get nervous  When I say nigger  Do you ever do variations  Like add other nouns?  This would have been  A much easier interview 
[03:14:00]  If you weren't here  I'll be honest with you  How about nigger?  You ever try a different  You ever try nigger?  How nigger?  How'd that roll off your tongue?  Any niggers here?  Why couldn't you be on  Man Cow Show  And Bill Burr be here today?  Yeah  Fucking intelligent conversation  Getting to use the word nigger  First usage of the word nigger  I believe it was in 1703  A lot of people don't know this  We look forward to the days  Where we can say that word 
[03:14:30]  But they used to spell nigger  With three G's  It used to be nigger  But during the great  Ink embargo of 1782  They took a G out  To save on ink  Save a lot of ink  They used to write that word a lot  Stop wasting that extra G  On them niggers  Holy shit  I'm just listening to this horse shit  It's not horse shit  If you were in the theater  It was a very interesting thing  That went on  I understand the context  Of this conversation  I don't have the balls  To do what he's doing 
[03:15:00]  And then get on the stage  And start pointing out things  Because it's part of what  Lenny Bruce did  Let me ask you a question  Are you saying that people  Are kind of enjoying  Comfortably saying nigger  In front of black guy  It's him being  Comfortable  You're right  The legitimate context  It's the validation  Of that you can actually  Get to say it  Because it's in the context  Right  Talking about  I'm not  The best part was  Don't get me wrong  The best part was  We all made believe  We didn't see you back up  And fold your hands  Yeah exactly 
[03:15:30]  That was fun  That was good  Fold your arms  Like ah damn  Here they go again  Let me not interrupt  This very heartwarming  And touching rendition  Of nigger  All I'm saying is  I'm pointing out  That the guy's got balls  To do that  Wait till they do  Wait till they do  The prior story  And he's up there  Going you know  Hey and white people  When they're doing  But somehow that  Doesn't do anything  Nobody cares  Exactly  Because whitey is afraid  We're scared shitless 
[03:16:00]  We are  No because we don't  You know because we know  That it's like hey whitey  Oh my god  That's the worst  Yeah it doesn't mean shit  The word is almost  Complimentary  Yeah right  To your power  Like you got  Uh oh cracker  The cracker's coming down on me  Cracker's is the name  Of the fucking  The sound of wit mix anyway  The man  But Nick  That's where the word cracker came from  I thought because they were like  White  No because  And salty  And we're yummy with peanut butter on us  It's the cracker to wit  It's the cracker to wit  The cracker  I swear 
[03:16:30]  I had no idea until today  Yeah it's the cracker to wit  And I really want to find a word  That makes white people go  Like as an abusive word  But cracker  Stick em up  Stick em up  Stick em up Caucasus  How about  How about I just move next door  Howdy neighbor  Howdy neighbor  Howdy neighbor  Howdy neighbor  Neighbor  God neighbor  That's it  Hey you fucking  Redneck neighbor  What 
[03:17:00]  Oh that's horrible  Oh jeez  I'm sorry  Look it wasn't Bob  It was just like  It's stomach laughing  You had to call us out  Oh no yeah  Wonderful  Loving conversation  It was just very interesting to me  When I went and saw the play  That's all  Yeah you know  And let's all remember  Opie brought it up  And Opie did say it twice  And Opie did look that way  But he didn't  Hey  I rarely say that word on this show  Oh look at that  Look at that beautiful butterfly  On this show 
[03:17:30]  Yes  On this show  Driving around the city  Is another story  I never heard such a loving conversation  With Nate  Wasn't it just loving  This was loving  It's love fest  Let me back up  I'm sorry  Alright get back over there  Yeah get back over there  All the truck drivers  Like oh man  I was getting into that  Jeez  God damn  He had to ruin  The whole god damn thing  He finally relating  To this stupid show  Yes yes  They backed off  The mics again  Well maybe it's the fact 
[03:18:00]  That they're back  Maybe it's the fact  That Gavin is here  And Gavin's against the wall  And his cock  Is still hitting the console  He can't fit in the studio  He's straddling the console  This guy's fucking huge  Oh wait we got a white  Word that pisses white people off  Patrice you suggest this  It's gonna get ugly  I need one  I need one  Kay in Jersey  Hey what's up  What's up  I got a word that pisses off  White folks man  Fucking Yaku  You gotta google it 
[03:18:30]  I'm not muslim  But I use it like  Fucking 50 times a day  In my house  And it's real derogatory  Towards white folks  Yaku  None of us know that  What is that  Is that white people  Got sent to the caves  I'll tell you what  Yaku is  He's the muslim mad scientist  Yes  That created white people  Now muslims are really good  At degrading white folks  Cause they don't think  You exist  You were made  In a laboratory  And when it  And in the bible  When they say 
[03:19:00]  There was  There was darkness  And God said  Let there be light  That was Yaku  Creating white people  On earth  It's not actual light  That you can see  Oh it's not like  Literally  It's darkness  It's let there be crackers  So blue eyed devil  Yaku is the mad scientist  Alright  And he was white by the way  I don't find that  As an insult at all  Not at all  It's not an insult  The property value  Is shit on the planet  And he wanted to  Bring it up a little bit  God said  Let there not be graffiti  God damn it  We need a supervisor  Let's go to Eric 
[03:19:30]  Eric what's up  Hey what's up  I just want to thank  The trees O'Neil  For explaining crackers  It's no longer an insult  Now it's a compliment  Call me a nigger beater  Oh wow  Way to take the  It looks so much better  Way to take the fun  Out of things  Alright let's go to  John on Long Island  John what's up  Yo what's up guys  You guys are fucking hysterical  Um a point  Niggers are the only people  Who call themselves  By their own derogatory term  Like if they see a friend  Walk into the room  Yo what's up my nigga 
[03:20:00]  First of all  Don't you hear  What they were just talking about  That's the point  That we  Right  White people  They just had this conversation  About how to take the sting  Out of our word  But it was  It was created  The word nigger  Came from the fact  That you  You didn't feel like  Saying negro  It was  It was your own dumbness  That created the word nigger  Because it was  Negro  Stupid us  Nigga  Nigga  And it can't  Nigga  And now we use it  As our thing  What's up  As a term of endearment  But I'm sitting there 
[03:20:30]  Listening to white people  Philosophy  About nigger  Shut up  And that's not true  Other people do  Address ourselves like that  Are you kidding me  Hey what's up  You think I don't see  You think I don't see  Anthony  And go  Hello good citizen  Hello law abiding  Law abiding gentleman  Hello tax paying gentleman  How you doing  Let's go to Newberg  Tim what's up  Neighbor 
[03:21:00]  I got a word  That white fathers  Don't like to hear  From black guys  Yeah  Father in law  Oh it's from black guys  Oh because  See what I'm saying  Do you see how difficult it is  I really want to find a word  That is the  Is the  Is the  Is the match to nigger  Like  They've been looking  But I don't know  It's fucking sting  But what about  But I mean it's like  You know  Like kike  You know  That's  That's Jew  Yeah that's pretty bad  Everybody has one  Everybody has a what  I mean  Because  What  Like the  What  Wasp  That's the scary word 
[03:21:30]  I mean what are you talking about  Are you talking about white people  Are you talking about  It's like  Okay  Like you just said  Kike  Will get a Jew  A little bit  Fucking  Get his nose in a bunch  If you said  If you said out loud  To a Jewish  You fucking kike  What  You fucking spick  You fucking  And yet at this  But there's no word  That you can say  To white people  To what white people  Anglosaxon white people  Right  Black people  Are subcategorized  Where  American  Black people  The word nigger  Is a lot worse  Than it is  Maybe you go down 
[03:22:00]  To the islands  And use the word  No nigger  Is  Has traveled the globe  It has a password  It's got a lot of  Nigger cannot  Nigger cannot get through  The metal detector  An aborigine  You can't  If you call the aboriginal  A nigger  Yeah  He'd be like  You mother  It's the worst  Racial slur going  The problem is  White people  Cover too many  Different groups  Which do have  Their own slurs  Yeah  Like when you think  Of white people  You do kind of  Think of Jews  And Italians 
[03:22:30]  And Irish  No you don't  And they're all covered  Yeah you'd like  Why is he white people  Like the Irish  Are mixed  And the Italians  Are dagos  I call white people  A nigger  That's what I do  On stage  I comfortably call  White people  A nigger  No don't do that  No  If it's truly  A non-offensive  What's up nigger  By the way  I want to thank  Jason Fisher  For getting Patrice  So heated today  Sorry  Yeah no  My pleasure  I didn't do anything  We were having a fun show  Before you got in here  I didn't even know  That motherfucker  Lenny Bruce did that shit  I just play him  On the stage man 
[03:23:00]  Don't  Yeah  Thanks a lot Jason  I like it man  Yeah my pleasure man  My pleasure  Wait Jason  I gotta plug the thing too  It's called  In his own words  The Zipper Theater  It's Monday through Friday  At 8 o'clock  Saturday at 8 and 10  And that's a 90 minute play  And it ends  February 25th  So definitely go check that out  It's amazing  I really enjoyed myself  Did you just  One act play by the way  No intermission  No intermission  Straight shot  Did you have to paw through  Like a bunch of his material  Or anything that's available  You know like  I don't know  I should have I think  But I didn't 
[03:23:30]  You know what I'm saying  Would that have made you  Do more of an impression  Of him  I'm not good at like  Imitating people  Like being like  You know do this  It's better just to capture  The essence of what he was all about  Than try to do an impression  Of the guy  Because so many people  Got so many ideas about the guy  And I was just like  You know fuck it  You know I mean  Like I kind of get it  I kind of feel like I get it  Have there been people  That have known him personally  That came up to you  Everybody you've ever met  Over 40 apparently  And met the man  And loved the man  What's their reaction  To what you're doing  They like it man  I mean you know  Some of them say  You know oh he never did this on stage 
[03:24:00]  He never did that on stage  You know he never did  And then some people  Are just like  You got him exactly  You know  And some people are like  Oh you got this part of him  And this and that  But I gotta say  Like there is like  You know  That people like  Who did dig him  And did like him  They like what's being done  For that reason  You know what I mean  I think that some people  Like the show  And some people get a kick out of it  But the people  Who really liked him  Are like  This is a really cool way  To you know  And the material holds up  By the way  Because you know  You're doing bits  That are well over 40 years old  And they hold up  To today's standards 
[03:24:30]  You know  It's talking about the war  And politics  Yeah the words themselves  And organized religion  And all that stuff  Is still happening today  At least with Lenny  The sentiment was I think  Very sincere  As opposed to comics today  Like there's a lot of comics today  That try to do racial stuff  And then apologize for it  After it's just a phony sentiment  And it's an excuse  Just to do racist material  They don't have the balls to do  Without a forced apology  Yeah  But I think what Lenny did  It was very very sincere  At least in the moments  I think that that's true man  I mean I think that he wasn't  I mean having nothing to do  With the racist thing  But having to do with the fact  Of the sincerity of the guy 
[03:25:00]  Is that like  He wasn't like  Just like some irreverent  Crackpot dude  Being like anything for a laugh  He like you know  Had like a sense of integrity  And stuff  I mean he seemed like  He was actually  A really cool guy  Yeah  Hey one of our friends  He played Lenny Bruce too  Oh they found it  We got a little taste  Of Rich Voss doing Lenny Bruce  Wow  I told a friend of mine  That I was going to see  The Lenny Bruce thing  You were doing  And he was pissed off  Because he couldn't believe  There was a Lenny Bruce role out there  And he didn't get the call  He didn't get the call  Here's Rich Voss  Doing Lenny Bruce 
[03:25:30]  Equestrian  Or whatever you call it  Always in the saddle  If you know what I mean  Right  She always had to be on top  Like I was some kind of horse  Or something  You know  That's right  Women like to be on top  That's Lenny Bruce  What about you  You like the top  Or are you more into  That traditional garden variety sex  Traditional  I don't think  You  I don't think  You have any answer for me yet  How many times a day  Three, seven  That was it 
[03:26:00]  A little taste  That was traditional  We'll get more  That was awesome  That was good  That was good  Rich Voss as Lenny Bruce  That  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Let's see if we're going to get along with Jason  What do you think of that Jason  You're going to see what you're all about right now  What did I think of that  Just be as honest as possible  He kind of sounded like he was from Jersey  Yeah there you go  Lenny Bruce in his own slurs  Watch out man  That's right  This is very traditional 
[03:26:30]  Hey officer  Kick the fucking hands off me  The government's trying to arrest me  And I'm dodging him  I'm dodging him  I'm being ground breaking here  He sounded more like  Lenny  I fucking  I bailed on it before I did it  Yeah  I couldn't think of a Lenny awful enough to compare that to  He sounded like anyone but Lenny Bruce  Holy shit  That was really bad  And he thought he should have  He sounded like Lenny Lenny Bobinny 
[03:27:00]  I couldn't think of a Lenny of Mice and Men  Lenny and Squiggy  What dumb Lenny did he sound like besides not Lenny Bruce  Lenny of Mice and Men and Squiggy  Oh he was fucking awful in that  And he was mad  Because you know we were supposed to do dinner  I'm like no I'm going to go see this Lenny Bruce thing  What someone else is playing him  They didn't call me  It's only because Voss' pseudo rat face  Kind of looks a little like Lenny in a certain part  That's the only reason they cast him 
[03:27:30]  Is because there's a slight physical resemblance  Where did they do it?  American Dream that TV show  I don't know if it's still on American Dream  Yeah  Can we write it so he has a wife named Bonnie  Who joins him on the stage  Because I can't go anywhere without her  Because Lenny was  He wasn't an irreverent guy  He is a friend of ours by the way  I figure this much  I swear to you  Don't sweat it  And Voss is not irreverent  I figure  Voss is a meat and potatoes idiot  There's nothing clever about Voss  This may be sacrilege  But I thought Lenny did a service 
[03:28:00]  I never thought Lenny Bruce was funny  But I thought what he did  Was necessary for the next level  You know what I mean?  And for the time  You got to take it in the context  It was the context  He was very important  But he never made me laugh  I listened to Lenny Bruce  And it just doesn't make me laugh  You think watching like  The Texaco Star Theater stuff  Is going to make you laugh  Like watching something on HBO now?  Slapstick holds up more than poignant humor  Don't attack me  I'm just saying  I am attacking  I'm just saying 
[03:28:30]  I just never thought Lenny  He's a comic  He's important  But he didn't make me laugh  I got a social commentator  I got a social commentator  Sinbad never made me laugh  He never made me laugh  I don't care about that nigga  Sinbad  Sinbad's not funny  Nope  Jesus  No  Motherfucking stupid  The nigga to fuck with  Sinbad is really Sinbad  And he's sailing around the world  Fighting  Fighting  He's actually  He's actually  Six arms with joints  Coming at him  He's fighting  He's fighting  One-eyed tigers now 
[03:29:00]  And these niggas like  Sinbad sucks  He's going to sail back here  Like oh  Sinbad  I heard you motherfuckers  Talking shit  Now  Hold up bitch  I'm going to finish fighting  All these Indians  With these giant swords  Actual Sinbad  Sinbad  Is that his name  Or two words  That describe his act  I go Lenny Bruce  You motherfuckers  Go Sinbad  That's right we did  You see what you do 
[03:29:30]  I'm sorry  That's right we did  Yeah Lenny Bruce  You think I was going to  Pull out Richard Pryor  I'm not stupid  Well what about  Shecky Jones nigga  He suck  I don't know man  Yeah I think like  The stories and whatever  When he just talked  About his own life  He was pretty funny  The bits  The bits themselves  He's important  He's an important guy  I just never  I don't listen to him  He was a great satirist  I don't laugh as hard  I've laughed at Lenny's stuff  But I'd say the majority of it  I just enjoyed  For what it was  As a piece of social commentary 
[03:30:00]  He was one of the first guys  To call people out on stuff  He was talking about  Religion and stuff like that  He was the most important  Person to comedy  But it was like  He was being more important  Than he was being  A funny dude  I think Carlin and Pryor  Incorporated the freedom  That he gave comedy  Into comedy  Like funny jokes  He was getting arrested  For just saying shit  He got arrested  For saying cocksucker  Yeah man  So he was groundbreaking 
[03:30:30]  But in terms of funny  The next guy's used  What he did  As funny  And now we just say  Cocksucker on the radio  And they pay us  Look at that  Look at how times have changed  How far we've come  I don't know if we can get this in  But there was a teacher  That was suspended  For using the n-word  It's a story that's happening today  What  What teacher  We keep discussing  It was the old  N-I-G-G-A version  So he thought he was okay  Now there's two versions  I'm going to tell you how phony  White people are  And this is what y'all  Going to do to yourselves  Because black people  Never do it  You do it to yourselves  The n-word  Itself 
[03:31:00]  Is going to be something  You're not going to be able  To say soon  That's how much  Hey man  You know  You hear the n-word  What  Why did you say that  That goes back to the whole thing  Oh but I'm just saying watch  It's like it's so fucking  Alright here we go  That's going to turn into  A taboo word  We're running out of show  So let's listen to this real fast  Well it is a word that evokes many emotions in people  It's a derogatory racial remark  That has divided people for many years  And a Jefferson County high school teacher  Has now received the longest suspension on record  For calling a student the n-word 
[03:31:30]  WHAS 11's defender Renee Murphy  Investigates what happened and why  In this story you'll only see on 11  Valley traditional high school  Is in the middle of a racial controversy right now  A teacher used the n-word towards a student  The word is only six letters long  But the impact is far reaching  And we do want to warn you  That some of the language in this story is strong  It may offend you  It may offend some other people  But since the story is not just about the n-word  It's also about the teacher's intent 
[03:32:00]  And definition of the word  We have decided to leave it in the story  For you to decide  Here we go  What did he say specifically to you  Sit down nigga  Whoa  Keyshawn Chambers is a freshman at Valley High School  A boy scout  A football player  A member of the ROTC  Was he standing?  An honor roll student  He was hanging around his teacher's classroom door in December  The teacher told him to sit down  And the teacher says that Keyshawn used the n-word first  And I just kind of was stunned a second  Well then 
[03:32:30]  Get away from the door  Nigga  And I was just  I repeated the same insult  Because that's sort of what I've been trained to do  What?  What happened?  Is the teacher black or white?  He sounds blackish though  There's a little black in that voice  I can't tell  I cannot tell  Black or white?  White guy  He's a white guy  Okay  He's finished  We're running out of show  Oh, I got another clip here to get to  Why is this word used so frequently? 
[03:33:00]  So  I just  I just don't understand it  And I'm trying to understand it  I need help  Yes, I use nigga  I've used it  I admit it  I put the H on it to emphasize  It's nigga  You know  Nigga  Nigga this  Nigga  Nigga please  Nigga  You know  Can you lend a nigga a pencil?  Can you get a nigga a job? 
[03:33:30]  This guy is gone  I'm on a high M  He's a genius  This guy is gone  Give a nigga his walking papers  One more short clip here  Dawson was suspended for 10 days without pay  From January 9th to January 23rd  And he has to go to diversity training  He says he has learned from this experience  And hopes that others think twice before using the N word  I will never say any form of nigga  You know 
[03:34:00]  I'm cured of that  Paul Dawson says that he is sorry for the way things were handled  But Keyshawn says that he is not looking for any apologies  Apologizing is going to change the fact that it happened  And he's not been punished  Oh shut up  And punishment in your mind is  I'm not having this job anymore  Oh yeah  Stop  Yeah fire down  If there was a black teacher  It wouldn't even be an issue  It happens every day  We can call you crackers  We can call  White teachers can call 
[03:34:30]  I mean black teachers can call white kids crackers  It's different  That was different  Sound  Sit down cracker  Sit your cracker ass down  Women black teachers say that  First of all the white kids should have been in a better school district  Absolutely  Secondly he wouldn't care  Alright we gotta get out of here for the weekend  And thanks to Jason Fisher  Yeah thanks  Yeah absolutely  Jason  Thank you nigga  Once again I saw it  I saw it two days ago and the play was unbelievable  It's the Zipper Theater  West 37th Street  Every day of the week
