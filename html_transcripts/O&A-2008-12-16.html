<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics throughout its broadcast.  The show began with Anthony recounting a near-miss in an Atlantic City poker tournament, followed by a discussion of the arson at his favorite restaurant, Mio, fueled by suspicious texts from his ex-girlfriend, Jill.  This led into a heated debate about the Pennsylvania family who named their son Adolf Hitler Campbell and the ensuing controversy surrounding the grocery store's refusal to write the name on his birthday cake.  This segment also included discussions on Charles Barkley’s alleged racist remarks, the shoe-throwing incident at George W. Bush, Mike Tyson’s weight gain, Governor Paterson’s proposed “fat tax,” and leaked nude photos of Pete Wentz, whose upcoming appearance was announced. The segment concluded with the "Fu Line," a collection of listener-submitted angry messages.

The next segment opened with a discussion about the hosts' differing definitions of a "gay" act, followed by reminiscences about a Comedy Central pilot and speculation about the awareness of participants in the *Borat* film regarding the pranks.  Pete Wentz then joined the show, discussing his experience DJing an underwhelming UFC party, the leaked picture of his penis, his past struggles with substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, and his recovery. He also talked about his life as a father, promoting his band's free Times Square concert and other appearances. Following the interview, Madonna's divorce, the Arena Football League's cancellation, and a story about a nine-year-old girl's letter to Santa detailing molestation were discussed.  The hosts also debated complaints about the perceived religious overtones in "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and other Christmas songs in schools, fielding listener calls on similar incidents.

The following segment focused on Christmas tree anecdotes, with Opie detailing his struggles carrying a large tree, contrasted with Kenny's purchase of a pre-decorated artificial tree. This transitioned into further discussions about political correctness in school Christmas celebrations and complaints about the Pledge of Allegiance.  A "Primetime Gossip" segment, satirizing Anthony's ex-girlfriend Jill Nicolini and the Mio fire, was included. A listener's question about the Founding Fathers' religious beliefs sparked a tangential discussion involving a bizarre Delaware castration plot, Danny Aiello’s singing, and a gastroenterologist correcting a colonoscopy report. The segment concluded with a discussion of favorite Christmas songs, including a comedic analysis of Bing Crosby and David Bowie’s "Little Drummer Boy."

The final segment started with a morbid guessing game about a celebrity's death, revealed to be a heart attack on a golf course, followed by the discussion of the deceased son's confession of violent fantasies about killing his father.  A listener's bull-running anecdote was shared, followed by a profane rendition of a Stevie Wonder Christmas song.  The show included advertisements for Ashley Madison, AmeriMerchant, ServiceMagic, and a credit repair system.  Discussions followed on least favorite 80s Christmas songs, listener calls about Christmas music, and a pajamagram commercial leading to discussions about office Christmas parties and infidelity.  The segment ended with a detailed discussion of the brutal kidnapping and torture of a 75-year-old woman, followed by promotional plugs for Jimmy's stand-up shows and the announcement of Greg Gutfeld as the next day's guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  it's the opium anthony show opium anthony radio shock jocks opium anthony  all right we get it sir we look at you we look at you as kind of a leader of the area's brotherhood  oh yeah how about that well uh yeah send me some literature can we do retard of the day  mongoloid of the day please let's do it we start we'll start with eric just to keep it fair 
[00:00:30]  you ever do the chicken dance in a wake that really bothers me  i say he's up there doing the chicken dance of the sky with the lord  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road  good morning  hello anthony what's going on ah what happened what happened with this poker thing back from my big 
[00:01:00]  uh my big poker poker tournament this was you know i would have been able to squeak through this one  and i uh won a bunch of money and a seat on the world series of poker 2009  this would have been strong yeah how did this all come about it seemed like it came out of nowhere 
[00:01:30]  i won a uh tournament playing with a bunch of cops  um about a month ago and that won me to see and uh yeah i went up there or down there to atlantic city  harris and uh i was doing good i was doing real good hung in there a long time  but uh oof then they switched me uh switched me to another table you know the table with the velvet 
[00:02:00]  ropes around it oh nice yeah right the one the one that's going to be the final table when everybody's  gone yeah the featured table they call it why don't they move you over there and how many hours  in the plane was this oh man quite a few yeah they started uh hmm started at noon and i guess they  moved me at around almost nine o'clock at night at night yeah wow so i was doing really good  disciplined playing nice playing right uh winning some big big pots having fun you know it was just 
[00:02:30]  good and then uh the blinds and andy's started going up really high so they start chewing you apart  and uh what the what the blinds blinds that's a bet that's where they get you that's a bet that  has to be made um when when the button goes around the table at a certain point you have to bet what  is called the blinds and the blinds go up every level so now if the blinds start getting up there 
[00:03:00]  into you know one thousand dollars for a blind and you're sitting there looking at your chips you got  to put a blind in and then you look at your cards and go ah i got seven deuce right or somebody raises  over the blind now you just got throw your blind away basically if you had a not many chips left you'd  play extremely conservative right but uh with the blinds and stuff they don't know you know this  that's how they eat you up and get you out they force you to kind of play right force the action  you can't just sit there all night or these poker games would go on for days yeah they would go on 
[00:03:30]  for days so seven two is good right because all you got to get is a three four five six yeah you're right  there see so you're right there three four five six by the way so it was uh you did that on purpose  hopefully yeah why three four five six uh-huh you only need five cards oh okay yeah which makes  it even funnier actually two three four five six seven whatever six cards straight six cards 
[00:04:00]  but anyway but there was some uh some heavy hitters there too yeah some of the pros some of the guys  you recognize from the old television set and uh you were playing with actual pros at the main table  yeah like who one of those uh well you know what they were they were those guys it's like i know  that guy can't remember his name but i i know him okay and you can recognize him by the giant stack  of chips in front of them oh really that's another way you recognize them um so uh yeah i was sitting 
[00:04:30]  there and uh uh it was time to make a move so i get dealt a what time was it time to make a move  uh i'm just trying to put a time thing almost uh what two in the morning two in the morning so  you've been playing for what 14 hours it was late with some breaks yeah wow yeah uh it was time to  make make a move i had a queen jack uh the someone bet um 2500 on it so i'm like all right let me see 
[00:05:00]  what happens with the old floperoonie so uh i bet and then uh the flop comes out and it's two jack  four so i'm like okay this this is my turn i got the high card on the board i paired it so i go all  in another guy goes all right i'll call you and then this other guy who i recognize from you know  the tv and he's got a giant stack he goes did he recognize you from the radio no a few people did 
[00:05:30]  though okay he goes uh yeah i'll call you i'm like ah fantastic but he he put a giant bet in so  he pushed the other guy out right so now it's just me and him and it gives me a chance to triple up  if uh things go well uh well i turn my cards over my jack queen he turns over his jack king oh yes  one of those like uh so you know hey there's two more cards to come out we see what happens 
[00:06:00]  so the turn comes out which is the uh fourth card and uh that turns out to be a king so now he's got  two pair so he's pretty much got me there done uh and then the the river card comes out uh to insult  me it is a queen which is your two pair which is mine you're a lower two pair uh yeah yes know when to  walk away no when to run you never count your money when you're sitting at the table yeah you 
[00:06:30]  should have like you should just sat there not wanting it's so close you should have said it's  only it's only from the lady to the man that's it or just sit there uncomfortably and not leave the  table like maybe no one noticed maybe no one noticed he won yeah i'm just gonna sit here you  should do that and make them go uh sir you got to get out leave sir but sir but sir i'm playing  sir please we need your seat i have to concentrate please don't make a scene please i'm playing the 
[00:07:00]  game sir unhand me unhand me boy you should just try to borrow money from the other players like  right there at the table yeah dude could you just borrow a couple of chips don't be stingy look i i get  there's a lot of strategy and hold them and all that but that's just one of those that's just that's  just that's a luck hand in the end that in the end it really is that in the end was the way that  they were set up but the only reason i was in it was based on you know i was in that hand because 
[00:07:30]  it worked out for me mathematically sure go into that hand there is love the people that say there's  no luck involved in in hold'em are crazy they'd like you to believe that you think there's more  strategy there's definitely more strategy there is more strategy just for the fact that most hands do  not go all the way to the river right that proves right there that it's not just hey let me keep  betting and we'll see what happens when the fifth card comes out right most of the time you push the 
[00:08:00]  opponents out you know you bet bet big uh uh before the flop you're gonna get less people playing  less chance that somebody's gonna pull one of these bonehead moves if they're holding on if you're  holding an eight three in your hand and no one raises you and you're in the big blind you're not  going anywhere now you could maybe get lucky and an eight three three pops up on the board you now  have a full house whereas if somebody would have raised you'd have been gone of course you're just 
[00:08:30]  folded those are the strategic moments also uh raising over the top of somebody it's very  intimidating when you raise somebody and they come back at you and bam double your raise you don't  know he might have crap but it's so intimidating then to sit there and go uh is my hand good enough  should i bet this what does he have you know there's absolute strategies well with that said how many  people did you end up uh taking out you think in 14 hours of play um i don't know like how many people 
[00:09:00]  were left when you finally got quite a knocked out uh not as many as as when i started i i i kind of  left in one of those not a huff but in a hurry yeah so i i just kind of put my jacket over my my arm and  walked out but uh did you do the old man yeah yes there was um yeah no i didn't get a sir please  don't spit on the floor that's strictly reserved for blackjack uh no i i was uh it was it was a good 
[00:09:30]  it wasn't one of those bad beats you know it worked out the car as the cards are coming out it was like  what even what am i gonna do right i went all in i i was trying to stay in in the in the game  and uh i got beat out by you know one card the king against the queen you should have went down there  and your first hand just go all in with anything the long ride to atlantic city i was doing very  well i don't velvet ropes and you just go all in first all in i'm out i saw a couple all right time 
[00:10:00]  to go home out within the first 15 minutes of course you know and then they're gone that's uh  all right that was pretty big but uh very happy with the gameplay had no problems um played well  so i'm happy with it so i guess you'll be sticking with radio for a while the poker thing  didn't work out yeah i guess i'm sure you had dreams of being the world champion champion of the world  series of poker well i'm a radio host yeah right exactly current champion right good i'd have to

[00:13:00]  was hot off the presses like before it even hit google what i'm not getting that about see i thought  you learned about this from the paper it's in the paper today but you learned about the fire at meos  before it hit the papers yes yes i was texted uh as you as you know um i've been raving about a  restaurant in roslyn called mio fine italian restaurant it was one of those places i would 
[00:13:30]  go into and uh all the staff knew me and um you know often they knew exactly what wine i liked  nice the uh the food fantastic and uh it was right there in roslyn and uh i used to go there  well i i found out through a text that uh meos uh burnt down 20 foot flames i'm reading in the 
[00:14:00]  paper total loss completely devastated you won't be going back there no more no and uh like i said it  it was before i i it wasn't on google it wasn't anywhere i got the news via text and uh this  person it was the first text i had gotten since probably um the end of the summer ah yeah re really  yes yes it was it was text from jill jill texted you to tell you that mio mio burnt to the ground 
[00:14:30]  20 foot flames like i said what else did she write in the text  she just said hey i hear your favorite restaurant burnt down well i hope you're eating there  i hope you and your whores she was just uh hoping you weren't going to respond meaning that there was  a possibility you were in the restaurant well that was one of the places if you recall during the um 
[00:15:00]  very publicized breakup yeah of uh what was called anthelini at the time and the breakup did involve  a fire i just exactly well if you i'm not saying anything i'm just saying i'm just throwing facts  out if you recall the um the uh well what the hell was i going to say now uh the the american express  bills that i would get would say um uh is this when you took your whore there or is this where 
[00:15:30]  you take your whores because like mia would show up a lot she would circle that on the bill on there  yes with a little note a little note this is where you take your whores and of course um there was an  episode where a girl that was at my house uh lost her clothing to a fire that was lit by ms nicolini  in the backyard of my house in the fire pit so when i heard on the news that mio had burnt down 
[00:16:00]  what they're calling a complete loss by the way a complete loss uh and getting the news from a text  from her it uh certainly was like wow that's ironic don't you think  you actually got the text a day before it burned down  i hear your favorite restaurant burned down in a few days  she's sitting out in front of the place with pesci discussing a date i'm trying to bang this radio 
[00:16:30]  guy henry hey henry yeah help me out here the smoke pouring out of the joint yeah she's trying  to get one of her girlfriends to go out with me but her girlfriend won't go out with this guy  help me out here yeah heat heat from the fire cracked plate glass windows and deflated globe lamps  at a restaurant across the street across the street and it should be noted the uh news day saying today 
[00:17:00]  that uh the fire is not considered suspicious well very uh very tragic i would say how does a fire  like that get so big hot and uh just involved so quickly i guess there's a lot of uh i'll tell you  a bad economy cooking oil you think somehow some people do tend to do that in a bad economy you see a  lot of restaurants kind of go up in smoke oh there's a picture of the fireman uh taking care of 
[00:17:30]  uh oh it's on the channel 11 site yeah prominently displayed yeah it sure is mio home of anthony and  his whores with a little bias popular eatery and brothel but she frequented by such scumbags as  anthony cumia but she had to text you yes a little tidbit yes it was one of those little things and  then she wrote nothing else did you write her back no no i i wasn't sure if it was you know one of those 
[00:18:00]  things like hey by the way one of your restaurants you know hey it burnt down and i was supposed to  answer back like oh wow that's a shame or if it was one of those where it's like yeah i just better  delete this because you know i don't know if it's meant as a ha ha ha ha or you know some  conversation but of course it's a ha ha ha i i figured it was a ha ha ha she's been waiting for 
[00:18:30]  her shot for a while yeah that was a good one she got uh she got her shot in that is like if i if i  ever went out to eat uh because i usually have you know my uh my chef make my food you know it's good  healthy but if i did go out that was the joint you know that was the place now gone where the hell  am i supposed to go fh riley's it's too far fh riley's for me i mean all right we'll open up uh like  uh get another branch there in uh you know around uh nassau county northern nassau we're gonna do

[00:19:30]  perhaps it was all right you insiders you know how uh restaurants can be we got some insiders  they say stuff that only a few people get ah no more than a few all right well there that sucks  for you i'm bummed about it because it was a very nice place now you certainly went there a lot  yeah well you're going to be be even more bummed because uh a grocery store will make a birthday  cake for a little three-year-old all three a little three-year-old wants to have a birthday cake 
[00:20:00]  they go to the grocery store and you know you pick the cake out and then they uh they customize  it right there they they squirt the name on there through that little thing and uh you know happy  birthday anthony i remember getting a few of those uh and why wouldn't they uh well look ah a little  three-year-old kid come on well we're gonna find out in a second here i think the parents are twisted 
[00:20:30]  on this story oh no they're not they're twisted here's the story problem well how about this  couple in uh pennsylvania they named their children one of them anyway adolf hitler and  the name's making a comeback enough time went by i guess why would you do that to your kid  i know what acid why don't you just grow the mustache and put it all on you instead of 
[00:21:00]  naming your kid adolf hitler they named their kid adolf hitler what's their last name what the  what was their last name adolf hitler campbell wait so their last name's not even hitler no so  no one's last name is hitler jesus point no one's last name is hitler but his middle name  it's adolf hitler campbell and uh apparently the store had a problem with with uh making a little  icing name that is really funny though just walk in and see if they'll do it well how about this 
[00:21:30]  couple in uh pennsylvania they named their children one of them anyway adolf hitler and another little  girl was named joyce lynn arian nation now their last name is all right you know every  how much attention do the parents need how much attention we get it you don't like blacks we get 
[00:22:00]  it that's all right they had they had a weight behind tyrone cake which uh took all day they have  a third child named hoslin himmler of course hamler hamler are you kidding me no this is  people taking names from history picking them out of a hat apparently you were talking about this last  week when you said barack hussein obama and you guys even speculated well maybe adolf hitler will  make a comeback maybe the name will make a comeback and uh it's starting with this uh courageous family 
[00:22:30]  in pennsylvania apparently they think it's time what are you doing to your kids really is embarrassing  do it to yourself if you want don't do it to your stupid kids in two thousand years will have  enough time have gone by where you can name your kid adolf hitler no why what's your friend genghis  khan think why don't you go out and ask him but that's just it i think you could go in and go could  you write genghis khan campbell on the cake and they would be fine with it yeah but um yeah i don't know 
[00:23:00]  there's a genghis khan's restaurant genghis khan restaurant and there could be an adolf hitler  restaurant and uh you know it's just enough time not enough time has gone by there's still and and  i think the fact that there's film of it yeah well you know if you're a bad guy without film you know  if you was slova don milosevic campbell uh it would never fit on the cake but i bet they'd do it  that hitler really ruined that name this guy's an ass look at his complete ass 
[00:23:30]  arian nation nation now their last name let me go back arian nation we'll start in the beginning  i gotta hear the adolf hitler campbell thing well how about this couple in uh pennsylvania  they named their children one of them anyway adolf hitler and another little girl was named  joyce lynn arian nation now their last name is campbell the whole point of the story is  apparently the little boy uh adolf hitler turned three years old recently they went to the local 
[00:24:00]  shoprite supermarket see that's where the news they're a bunch of scums they decide to just  forget about the last name camel part out yeah leave the campbell part out because it's it's  it's just fun to say adolf hitler the little boy adolf hitler right what happened to the  campbell part but then this guy loves the attention he gets when he goes to the store and he goes i want  the cake says adolf hitler like yeah he just what an attention whore what are you doing dude he's uh  he's a white supremacist apparently oh that's wonderful good for him yeah and uh he's teaching 
[00:24:30]  his children in the with the ways of the uh white supremacist good for him why why does he allow his  kids a chance yeah well just do that but you know kids decide you mean you mean like crap on their  own when they get a little older you mean like uh black families that uh drill into their head that  the white man is evil and the devil and you watch little kids on uh youtube talking about the evils of  the white man and the system and everything just like that is that uh you want any better you want  adolf hitlers huh you want adolf hitlers out there opie i would love for us to all get along and 
[00:25:00]  and not have this kind of thing even even be necessary but you know something you're going  to get extremists on both sides this guy is no better or no worse than uh black militant  a family raising their children to hate white people just it happens there are there uh what  are called uh evil people on both sides but this is about this is about this guy and his hitler kid  yeah exactly little adolf hitler there's not my there's not many black names and there might be 
[00:25:30]  some that you're going to walk into a shop right and get the shock value like oh what do you mean  hitler you know this is just an attention-seeking thing what like uh lewis farrakhan campbell maybe  maybe so farrakhan may be a little racy but he didn't slaughter six million people and when we  get the course not when we get the black version of the story we'll certainly uh do a little something  something on that as well you'll never you'll never get it but today it's it today it's this this  ass you'll never get it today it's all about this ass apparently the little boy uh adolf hitler 
[00:26:00]  turned three years old recently they went to the local shop right supermarket in greenwich township  and the supermarket refused to make the little boy a birthday cake they said they would make the cake  and let the family fill in the name afterwards but the family felt that that was not right they  wanted to go bad for that little boy who's in the middle of all that absolutely i mean what were the  parents thinking what were the parents thinking like it was an accident or something like what  were they thinking on a whim what were they thinking when they named it the kid yeah we'll put it on his 
[00:26:30]  birth certificate and then they got home and go did we do that like it was on a lark yeah on a lark  they're thinking exactly this that they wanted some attention they would go to the news  and get some attention for themselves you got it little little cement crib looks like a bunker they put  him down in how adorable little little three-year-old adolf hitler that's just amazing 
[00:27:00]  uh you see from basher had a funny line it was a vanilla cake with all white frost  uh we are pretty doomed uh as far as the races go as per the internet why every news story  that has anything to do with race even in the slightest way starts a text comment race war 
[00:27:30]  of the umpteenth magnitude it's nothing but um n-word this and uh die cracker that  where where on those sites no this is on any news site you know these days you could read a news  story and then comment comment below okay right every single news story that involves uh let's say  uh black on white crime um uh any any any type of racial story turns into just a a race war in in 
[00:28:00]  text and and really like they go all out no holds barred because they're cowards on the internet so  you've argued enough with patrice or other people oh yeah yeah when you're in face to face with  somebody usually you both kind of some people you can but most people you can kind of see a point  they have and they can kind of you know you can kind of go find some common ground usually yeah  because you realize there's a guy there who kind of thinks like i think he's just on the other side 
[00:28:30]  of the fence is that there's a weird connection when you're face to face but it's like when on on  everybody's a coward on the internet you're right they they are cowards but there is this weird  um almost honesty in their hatred uh that that uh comes out in these things because some of the  stories are so heinous and so blatantly open yeah to uh a racial discussion but you're not really  going to get a discussion online you like you said people are they they get their uh keyboard bravery 
[00:29:00]  and uh can type whatever they want so there is in some cases this honesty in in in their mutual  hatred yeah in other cases though it's just purely you know unnecessary that's true let's say  how did derrick in atlanta derrick yo what's going on derrick not too much man i just you know i'm  just blown away because right now charles barkley is saying straight up a couple years ago he wanted  a basketball coach he said i don't care what his record is i just want to be a black coach 
[00:29:30]  how is that not racist if i would have said that i'm wearing a white hood i mean what what's the deal  yes i you know charles barkley's a pretty uh racist dude he says what he wants he said some  pretty crazy things over the years dude just because charles barkley isn't like he shouldn't  be penalized for saying that that's he's not the problem the problem is the people that are  penalizing white athletes for saying what they want or that that's the barkley's not the barkley's not  the problem though no no i'm just there's just one example yeah we could you know we and we have in 
[00:30:00]  the past we've talked uh double standard uh so we're blue in the face yes sure but uh it's just the  way it is and it's the way it's going to be for for quite a while all right there it is thank you  have a good day thank you sir uh do we have an update on the the shoe thrower i'm sure you saw the  shoe thing with book right while you're playing poker you know george they only showed it a hundred  and actually a couple hundred times george bush must have been uh one of the greatest dodgeball players 
[00:30:30]  uh in school that man bobbed and weaved and and dodged that shoe at uh point blank range pretty  much the guy walks right up to him heaves the shoe and uh george bush he had some moves on him  he had like cat-like reflexes and he was smiling he sort of had a little fun with the whole thing  you could tell by the second one he he put his hands on the podium like all right yeah i'm gonna  dodge the second one yeah he should have taken his giant shoe off and lobbed it back 
[00:31:00]  the guy and they're praising this guy they they should lop his head off for not being able to  hit the guy from 10 feet away yeah everyone knows you aim a little lower just in case the person is  ducking and then i guess the secret service were ready to just pound this guy and well they came  out of the back and george bush uh diffused the situation a little bush did yeah yeah he was like  you know that's not necessary to completely uh destroy the guy right i'm sure if it was um in the  united states and it was some uh you know college dork that did it uh he'd have been saying don't 
[00:31:30]  tase me bro but you know he's got it he's got to look like he's supporting these people no matter  what i understand your frustration you know so they let him off the hook they did arrest him though  is he gonna be freed well he's in military custody of the iraqis so i plan on seeing him get hung  on a phone cam they said he could get two years two years that's about it wow that he that was a 
[00:32:00]  great move yeah the president has to move duck to the side at least he didn't look like our president  did not look like a sissy during that at all i'm happy he didn't look like a little punk if he would  have gotten nailed though oh my god and then look at him smiling he's into this because the other  shoe he just kind of he just kind of put his arm up on that second one like yeah you're not even  look here's the smile what do you got what else you got what else there it is i know you had ammo 
[00:32:30]  now he only got two feet yeah your clip is empty ain't it thank god he didn't have three feet  from now on only heather mills can go to these things here come doc ock with a bunch of shoes  well thousands have taken to the streets in iraq uh to protest the fact the guy got arrested for  this just thousands what you know something yeah and even uh egypt who uh is pretty much on our side 
[00:33:00]  is uh is praising this guy because they're on our side when they're protesting throughout the uh the  middle east on this one good he's a hero exactly who's saying if a guy got up and threw a shoe at  hussein or his two kids uh i think the the thing is you never need shoes again when you walk around  on your stumps where your feet used to be attached that's how they used to handle stuff oh we could 
[00:33:30]  have just had like nice little ops over the place the no enforced no fly zone for the rest of his life  yep just keep flying keep his crap on the ground embargo the hell out of him but no we had to go in  there and save the world and now the president gets a shoe thrown at him and everybody cheers  should just left saddam he knew how to deal with them oh did he know how to deal with them  huge trenches just plow them right in there then their shoes they they love their shoes over there 
[00:34:00]  no one uh when uh we took the place over there and and and pulled down the statue they all threw  their shoes and the guy was riding on the big statue head hitting it with the shoe yeah they love  beating things with it's weird because that's the ultimate insult for a country that has no problem  beheading you yeah yeah this is bizarre to me the ultimate insult is throwing a shoe i threw my shoe  with the president which pretty much means nothing in america he slipped the first one and the second  one he batted away with his hand it was very embarrassing i was 10 feet away and i missed 
[00:34:30]  i need better sights on my shoes and then i threw my glasses but they did nothing i was arrested and very  injured they bashed my head apart and i fell down the stairs him in his shoes dummies let's say hi to eric in  virginia eric what's going on buddy hey after the uh the audio of it when um uh after he settles

[00:35:30]  off your shoes off jeff in chicago hey guys how you doing good jeff hey uh if if there was an american  reporter that did that to somebody from another country that dude would be uh he'd be put on a  blacklist and be labeled a terrorist for the rest of his life and his life would be ruined yeah i agree  with you gotta agree with you on that one all right yeah they they treat those uh iraqis there with  kid gloves because uh you know we're saving those people apparently and they love us for it oh they love

[00:38:00]  we got a couple uh christmas stories we're gonna get to in a second fun christmas stories  but first there's a picture of um tyson in the paper today mike tyson yes wow and he is huge  There's a picture of Tyson in the paper today.  Mike Tyson, yes.  Wow.  And he is huge. 
[00:38:30]  We thought for a second it might be the clothes he's wearing, like big slacks and a puffy shirt.  But then you do a little more research online and you realize that Mike Tyson is a monster now.  He is just huge with a huge belly.  His gut is going over the top of his belt.  He's ballooned up.  His legs are like fat in his pants.  You know, you got to expect that to happen.  The guy's not in the gym every day like he used to be when he was fighting. 
[00:39:00]  And then he's probably still eating exactly the same way.  Yeah.  And where does it go?  Right to your hips.  Right to the belly.  You don't think he orders healthy food when he's out?  Yeah, right.  Give me the chickens.  Give me the skinless chickens.  And I have the unsweetened iced tea.  And a bitch I could punch.  Yeah, he's not even working it off.  You haven't even heard him in the news like that. 
[00:39:30]  Now, this is a picture of him with some young, lovely thing.  And in front of them, a couple of Red Bulls.  Red Bulls, they have a lot of sugar.  That'll pack on the pounds around the belly.  Yeah.  And then it looks like a bottle of champagne on ice as well.  Mmm.  Yeah, I like treating my girls before I rape them.  Allegedly.  Well, no.  I went to prison for it.  Good point.  That will rape.  Good point.  Only allegedly until he held guilty. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, good point on that one.  I allegedly didn't rape her.  Oh, wow.  So you might want to...  I will throw that up on onaradio.com.  Someone did a...  Somebody did a before and after when he was in ridiculous shape where everyone feared him.  Hey, get a load of fats over there.  In the gym.  He just crutches you.  You know the guy's big meatball would still knock your head off.  I think everyone still fears him even though he's a fat guy.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  A lunatic.  He's officially a fat guy.  You would say that's a fat guy.  I'm on the low-fat Zoloft now trying to drop the pounds.  Sugar-free Prozac.  Yeah, that before and after picture, the side-by-side is just amazing.  All these boxes, though, God, they're just stupid is what happens.  They're easily influenced because they come from, I guess, a pretty bad place.  They get somebody that they can latch on to that latches on to them. 
[00:41:00]  And then once it's over, it's just over.  They set them adrift.  They get all fat and stupid.  They try to tell jokes in their big stupid club.  Oh, God.  LaMotta.  Oh.  Tyson's a black version of Jake LaMotta.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Wearing sort of the same clothes, too.  Yeah, he's getting heavy.  Sexual problem, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And LaMotta, too.  Yeah.  Belting some broads.  You know what?  It's kind of sad.  Very.  It's kind of sad to see these athletes that you grew up watching, you know, become kind 
[00:41:30]  of soft.  And how much money did he generate?  I'm not talking about even making.  Hundreds of millions.  Making for himself.  Just generating money that went to other people.  Those pay-per-views, everyone used to get him.  Yep.  There wasn't one Tyson fight where you didn't go, I got to see this animal just kill somebody.  And, you know, it was fantastic to watch.  After Tyson, people weren't buying these pay-per-views like they used to.  No.  I mean, they still did very well, yes. 
[00:42:00]  But, I mean, this was mainstream stuff.  You would have, like, Tyson parties and stuff.  Yeah, man.  Every time you fought.  He'd fight and you'd have people over the house just going, all right, this is going  to be, don't go to the kitchen.  No.  Don't go to the kitchen when that bell rings because he's going to come out like a bulldog.  An animal.  And kill somebody.  How many people walked from the kitchen back into the living room with their armfuls of  snacks, like a Pepsi and some popcorn and a hot dog, and then everybody was putting  their jackets on at the party.  Oh, I missed it.  The worst is being in the kitchen, gathering it up and hearing, oh, oh, no. 
[00:42:30]  What was the big one?  The Michael Spinks fight?  Oh.  Right?  It was Tyson Spinks.  We all paid for that one.  That was a good one.  We haven't talked about this in years.  How long was the fight?  I want to guess 93 seconds.  Yeah, it was less than two minutes, I believe, right?  Oh, fantastic.  First round knockout.  He just, yeah.  The way he came out from his corner, just with his head down and just almost running toward 
[00:43:00]  the guy.  Yeah.  And then opening up on him.  I think there's a market for redoing these big fights with the guys today.  Can you imagine?  You get a fat Tyson in there with whatever Michael Spinks looks like.  Old, crackhead-looking Spinks.  Does he?  Yeah, yeah.  I see him.  He's a friar, so I'll see him at the friar's events.  Oh, that's right.  Michael Spinks looks good.  We did meet him.  What roast was that?  That was the Pat Cooper roast.  Pat Cooper roast we met Michael Spinks.  Pat Cooper.  Imagine that, though.  Who wouldn't buy that pay-per-view?  The Tyson-Spinx rematch.  A fat Mike Tyson and an in-shape Michael Spinks. 
[00:43:30]  That would be a much closer fight.  Yeah.  And he took over.  Spinks beat Larry Holmes, man, who was, I think, 49-0.  Yeah.  Going to tie Marciano's record.  The best part of the Tyson-Spinx fight, and you can watch it on YouTube, the beauty of the  internet, is when Spinks tries to get up.  Go to that part again.  When Spinks tries to get up, he could barely get on a knee before he falls back over, almost  over the ropes, over the bottom rope.  Oh, did he get just knocked him the F out. 
[00:44:00]  He doesn't know where he is.  He's looking around like, when's the fight?  Now, to get this excitement, you've got to watch UFC, but watch him.  He gets up on a knee, and right on his face.  He just falls on his face.  Tyson was the man.  Mike Tyson.  He was the man.  You ever see the Ali, like, Muhammad Ali was being interviewed, and he was already in  bad shape by Arsenio.  Sure.  And it was a really tough interview, because Ali just was, he said he's on his way out already?  Yeah, he's really hard for him to talk.  They brought Tyson out, the young champion. 
[00:44:30]  Tyson and Ali's like, I'm afraid of him.  And you could see that Ali really knew that this kid was a major problem.  I'm afraid of him.  What's he going to do?  Punch some sense back into your head?  All of a sudden, he could talk back like the old Ali.  Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.  Thanks for punching me in the head.  Yeah, Ali and Tyson on the same talk show.  Good call, Jimmy.  I don't remember this going on.  I'm going to watch, I mean, Arsenio, I'm going to watch this later today. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, speaking of fat, our governor, the blind governor who's outraged by the SNL skit, whatever.  Just take your little beating and move on.  Well, Ali was still kind of with it.  You don't remember how long ago Arsenio was on until you look at that fade haircut.  Arsenio, that's 20 years easy.  Jesus.  I think he was late 80s, right?  Yep, early 90s.  And there was, I forget, I can't see who Tyson's on there with, but it was kind of, the thing  that was cool about this.  Sugar Ray Leonard.  Oh, I couldn't see.  You got Sugar Ray, you got Muhammad, and you got Tyson all on the same couch. 
[00:45:30]  And just to see these other guys acting like little kids around Ali was kind of, you know,  everybody was kind of, you know, I guess.  Jimmy's got one of these memories.  Yeah, it's called worthless.  Yeah, that's what it meant.  And Muhammad Ali was already, like, slower?  Sure he was.  Oh, I can't wait to watch this later.  All right, listen, moving on, we got, I was talking about Patterson, speaking of fat,  the blind governor who's all mad about the SNL skit.  Yeah, whatever.  Get over.  It's a joke.  Relax.  He's, we should be mad at what he's doing. 
[00:46:00]  Taxing sight is probably the worst thing he can do.  There you go.  He said he likes good jokes, but I mean, you know.  That's a damn good one right there.  His favorite is two Jews walking to a bar.  I've done that, too.  Take that one, stupid.  Can't take a little joke from SNL.  But then he turns around, he outrages everybody in New York State.  He wants to go with a fat tax? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  He wants to go with a fat tax?  Mm-hmm.  Look, I'm not a fan of the people that indulge themselves to a point they get ridiculously big.  I understand we all have our struggles, but, you know, but you can't tax.  Mm-hmm.  You can't tax fatty stuff.  People are living paycheck to paycheck already, and now we've got to deal with another tax?  He must hate those votes when they all go, the ayes have it.  Mine don't. 
[00:47:00]  He has to vote nay on everything.  The worthless orbs have it.  Those dead marbles have it.  That's right.  More blind jokes, Gov.  He wasn't a paper saying he could take a joke.  All right, we'll see.  Yeah, well, he was a little upset at that SNL thing.  They got a little carried away, I guess, with the allegations of cocaine use and whores. 
[00:47:30]  They didn't get carried away at all.  Yeah, his blindness.  They were goofing on that.  They were just going with some of the stuff that Governor Patterson said himself.  Yeah.  Making him look a little silly walking into the, you know, the camera shots and stuff  while they were trying to do other things.  Holding the chart upside down.  Holding the chart upside down.  That's just funny stuff.  Come on.  What are you going to do?  And you know he would actually be doing that if he didn't have people holding him back.  Like, no, no, no, no.  No, don't move.  Stand right where you are.  He actually does pretty good.  Look a little more to the right, so it looks like you're looking into the camera. 
[00:48:00]  He does pretty good, aside from, you know, the wacky look sometimes.  He seems like he's in control and knows what he's doing up there in Albany, but this obesity  tax is just ridiculous.  He wants to tax non-sugar-free soda.  What are the products he won't tax?  Cheetos?  I don't even know.  Cookies?  Let's hit the news story here and we'll find out.  Antimundona?  In an effort to close the $15 billion state budget gap, New York Governor David Patterson 
[00:48:30]  is calling for a 15% tax on soft drinks.  If you drink diet, you're okay.  The tax would only be imposed on regular sodas.  The logic?  It could generate more than $400 million while helping to curb obesity.  Well, that's wonderful, but how about you find that money somewhere else?  And then it's a bunch of...  I don't even...  You're going to curb obesity?  And I don't even drink soda.  I have maybe...  Honestly, maybe three sodas a year.  Yeah.  But enough with the taxing.  People can't afford crap as it is.  They don't need more taxes put on them.  We're just tax-fat people. 
[00:49:00]  Like, any time you walk into a store, you step on a scale and people go, give us a few  bucks, we're uncomfortable looking at you.  Just instead of a weight, yeah, a money amount.  That's pretty much what...  And on the scale, and you have to pay that.  That's pretty much what they're getting at with this, right?  Yeah, fans.  I guess he sees what the smoking...  No, he doesn't.  Well, I guess he sees what the cigarette tax has done, you know, taxing the hell out of  cigarettes.  So he's like, ah, look, we could generate more money doing the same thing with soda. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  That's just BS.  Yeah.  Find the money somewhere else.  Nothing left to tax.  That's crazy.  Now they want to, like, put the tolls on the...  On the free bridges, now on the east side of New York City.  That's wonderful.  I don't know how they're going to do that.  How about you talk to the regular Joe out there and to find out that they can't afford  this stuff.  Joe the plumber?  Not Joe the plumber.  We might have Joe the plumber on, I think, soon.  Oh, joy.  Yeah.  And like Jimmy suggested, only ask him plumbing questions. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Nothing political.  I just want to know about vent pipes, traps.  Toilets.  Elbows.  Elbows.  Joe, I got a jiggle to handle.  What do I do?  PVC versus cast.  Joe, go.  Pose on regular sodas.  The logic?  It could generate more than $400 million while helping to curb obesity.  It's good.  I mean, keep kids healthier.  Sodas have a quick fix for kids, so.  For that reason, some public health advocates like the soda tax, hoping it will lead to healthier 
[00:50:30]  choices.  You know what?  That is ridiculous.  People are going to continue drinking their soda.  No one's going to get healthier because you tax soda.  Yeah.  They're just going to, uh...  They're just going to pay more for their soda.  And it's not going to make people healthier.  It's not a health thing.  You think it's only soda that make people fat?  It's only soda.  People are still going to be unhealthy and obese eating crappy food.  Well, it's under the guise that they're taking care of people by trying to make them healthier. 
[00:51:00]  No.  No, they're trying to get more money from us.  They need cash.  They don't give a crap about your health.  Whenever they talk about your health, just stop listening.  They don't care about you.  You know, instead of taxing the crap out of people, where are the cuts?  I want to hear what they're cutting.  Because you always, whenever, especially in good, prosperous times, you constantly hear about the government overspending for everything. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  And it's almost a joke, like when you hear the typical old cliche, $10,000 for a hammer, or something like that.  But there's so many redundant jobs in the government and things that are just business as usual, that they never think of cutting because it's just been that way forever.  Just like taxing the people has been that way forever.  So instead of making a real difference, and this Obama's talking change, change, change, and the change is the same old story, tax, tax, tax, how about cutting the government? 
[00:52:00]  Slimming down the government and saving a crap load of money.  Let these poor bastards try to get out and get a job after they've been booted out of some cushy government job.  Enough!  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  They should heavily tax seeing-eye dogs.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah, I think Patterson's being selfish. 
[00:52:30]  He wants a $2,000 tax on glasses.  Right.  He's just thinking of things that he's not going to use over explaining a mediocre joke.  Yeah.  They should heavily tax sunglasses.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Of course, visine.  Yes, bowling alleys.  Movie theaters.  But he wants headphones discounted tremendously.  Heavily taxed blues musicians.  You know, wherever you get the money.  Right, Gov?  Jerk.  I think SNL does another blind skit. 
[00:53:00]  Are they done for the year?  Yeah.  Ah, that sucks.  I would love to see if they have balls to do another blind skit.  They bring in some new people in next year?  Because they dumped a few, didn't they?  Well, Amy Poehler's gone.  Amy Poehler's gone.  Poehler's gone.  Did she re-up?  I heard she re-upped to do Hillary.  They may make short appearances, but she's got a sitcom in development.  Okay.  Oh!  She said goodbye on Saturday, and you won't see Tina Fey back, they're saying, unless it's  a guest spot.  Oh, that was a special thing, because Sarah Palin comes out of nowhere to look just like 
[00:53:30]  Tina Fey.  We knew that wasn't going to last.  They brought in two or three people in the last couple of weeks.  You just kind of saw them woven in.  Yeah.  Amy Poehler, man.  She was really funny.  Yeah.  She's a funny, funny lady.  I've watched her improv at Second City.  She'll go on sometimes, and they do, I think, a Sunday show, or whatever night of the week  it is.  And she's brilliant, man.  I mean, she's really funny.  She is really funny.  Her and Tina Fey.  You've got to give it to them.  Why can't one politician just have a little fat neck in a week?  Why can't I look like the next guy where they need me? 
[00:54:00]  And, like, he blinks rapidly, and he's not a good actor?  I mean...  Yeah.  Perfect impression.  Hey, did we have Amy Poehler on back when the Upright Citizens Brigade came in?  When we were on N.E.W.?  Might have.  I think we might have had her on, now that I think about it, before she was famous.  I'm going to have to look at old pictures.  This is not true, Dennis.  Dennis and P.A., what's up?  What?  Hey, I want to play devil's advocate on the whole soda tax. 
[00:54:30]  Sure.  Suppose they tax the soda, and people say, all right, we're not going to drink your soda  anymore.  Now they don't get their $400 million, and your soda company's turning to GM and Chrysler.  I don't think the devil would care about this.  Companies go out of business, people lose jobs.  Dennis, no one is giving up soda anytime soon.  I know, but I'm like you.  I don't drink soda either, but, you know, it's probably used to when we were younger,  but we got smart and gave it up.  Look, you've got to fight for all this stuff.  You can't just allow the government to keep taxing you. 
[00:55:00]  I could care less about people being taxed for soda, but you can't allow this.  It's ridiculous.  I understand.  It doesn't affect me personally, but it's enough already.  If you talk to people on the street, they're living paycheck to paycheck, and now the governor  is trying to find $400 million, so he's going to tax soda?  Soda?  I agree.  I agree, but...  That's the only thing people look forward to these days.  A stupid sandwich and a can of soda.  Leave them alone.  Soda.  Leave them alone. 
[00:55:30]  Or a pop.  Some places they call it a pop.  Well, upstate they do.  That's right.  It is New York State.  Yeah, upstate they did the pop thing.  I asked for a soda once.  They looked at me like I had two heads.  Right.  Can I have a soda?  I guess a soda is like when you order a scotch and soda.  It's like just club soda.  Yeah.  Or seltzer or something like that.  Right.  You do have two heads.  Jambage, you're right.  Let's go to Jersey.  John, how are you, buddy?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  What's up there, Jimmy?  How do you think? 
[00:56:00]  They're cutting $35 million out of the FDNY budget.  There's actually stations that are only open during the day.  They're closed at night.  They're closing houses all over the place.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah, there was a fireman that was caught calling in false alarms and starting fires  because they were closing down his firehouse.  Yeah.  Well, he was a little out of rage.  Hey, we're needed here.  All of a sudden, there's huge fires going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's $35 million off the FDNY budget. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's a big story.  They're cutting those boys down.  Ridiculous.  Baltimore checking in.  Greg, how are you?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Listen, I just wanted to look.  I'm sorry.  No, we just said good morning.  Go ahead.  We're sorry.  Oh, okay.  Down here in Baltimore, our mayor has not only cut the fire department budget, cut the police  budget, cut overtime for police officers.  Crime is up. 
[00:57:00]  She fired people in her staff and gave herself a raise.  That's always good when they give themselves raises.  They vote themselves a raise.  Oh, they didn't even vote it.  They snuck it in.  Nobody knew.  That's beautiful.  Yeah, it is.  Merry Christmas.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  It's not going to be a Merry Christmas for a lot of people.  You missed it yesterday.  We learned that the lady who's been firing everybody.  Right. 
[00:57:30]  She was known as what again?  The Grim Reaper.  The Grim Reaper.  Uh-huh.  And it was a known fact that the Grim Reaper came to your radio station here in New York.  You know, CBS owns a bunch of stations in New York.  Yeah.  To bring everyone on board.  She was the Grim Reaper.  If she showed up at your station, you know there was trouble going down.  Some people are getting thrown out the door.  And our whole job for the company last month or so was to fire people, right?  Uh-huh.  Well, they fired her while you were away.  How do you kill the Grim Reaper?  But Jimmy makes a good point.  That means maybe the firings are done. 
[00:58:00]  And maybe we're going to skate after all.  Or they got a cheaper Reaper.  Or they got a cheaper Reaper.  They figured they could do it by email now.  Right.  Or just hire some messenger to show up with a get out and ask.  I had a little hope, but now, all right, now I'm wondering.  One never know.  Yeah.  That's how crazy things are.  The lady that felt good about her job, because she's the one that fires everybody, gets fired.  Yeah.  That's insane.  Out the door.  It was awful.  She'd actually walk into the room carrying a boombox playing Don't Pay the Ferryman.  It was just too morbid. 
[00:58:30]  How old am I?  She should have pulled a, no, you're fired.  Well.  When they sat her down.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  Like, I'm sorry, we're going to have to, you're fired.  You're fired.  I beat you to the punch.  Wait a minute.  How can I fire you if you just fired me?  That's a good point.  We're going to have to let you go.  No, you're not.  Why don't people just start rebelling against these firings?  No.  I'm not going anywhere.  Just keep coming to work. 
[00:59:00]  I'm staying at my desk.  Sit at your desk.  Hey, we got Pete Wentz coming in today from Fallout 4.  What?  Yeah, there are new CDs in stores today.  Why am I looking at a picture of his penis?  Why wouldn't you be?  Sam, Sam freaking puts the bio together and look what he, what is he, what, Sam?  He's apparently dead.  What's this about?  He did with his cell phone cam what we all do with our cell phone cam.  Why are you showing me this?  Sam, comment.  It's information I thought you guys should have. 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  So what?  These pictures came from his sidekick and there was an oopsie and made it onto the internet?  One of those?  Yeah, but if I just wrote about it, you guys would be like, yeah, but what did it look like?  Oh, he sent it to a fan, though.  Yeah, we would.  You got to respect that.  Jimmy will have something to talk about with Mr. Wentz.  I don't know how to send it, no.  You must have a Blackberry.  Yeah.  We could discuss that, how you send the naked pictures to fans.  We could email ours with the iPhone. 
[01:00:00]  That's cute.  That's a cute little thing.  Because now at least people know if they want to send me a picture, they email it to me,  which is pretty cool because then I can pop it right up on the iPhone.  The text feature, not being able to send pictures is still a pain in the ass, but all right.  And wouldn't you, why is it on the internet?  Like, does somebody, a fan, just post it after this guy sent his hug?  We're going to ask him when he gets in here.  Is he here yet?  He's not here yet.  I think he said before they stole his sidekick or something.  And he hacked into it. 
[01:00:30]  And he has crushes on guys, but he's saying he's not gay or something.  Like, he had a crush on...  John Mayer.  John Mayer.  A man crush?  He said anything above the waist is cool by him.  So, like, he'll make out with a dude or whatever, but he won't go below the waist.  Wow.  What is that about?  That's questionable.  What is that about?  To say the least.  What does that mean?  We'll have to ask him, huh?  I don't know.  Wow.  Sam.  Well done.  Didn't we learn on the show that as soon as you start the kissing thing, 
[01:01:00]  then you're really...  Then you're officially...  Yeah, because...  If you do anything else, you're kind of not,  but as soon as you start the man-on-man kiss, then...  Yeah.  That's worse than the hardcore stuff.  It's worse than below the waist.  It has been said on this show a few times.  That's the line for some people.  Mm-hmm.  Well, when you start really, you know, getting sensual  and making out on another dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The back...  When the back of your fingers are caressing the other dude's cheek.  That's kind of...  Creepy. 
[01:01:30]  Like when you're laying in a pillow with another man, right?  And you're over him, and you do the soft kiss...  Oh, Jimmy.  But then you sneak up, and you kiss the tip of his nose,  and brush your fingers against his stubble.  And feel...  That makes it gay, right?  A little.  A little.  But he says anything above the waist is okay?  That's what I've read.  That goes against what we talk about.  I agree. 
[01:02:00]  Do you?  Yes, I do.  I've seen you with Bob Kelly.  No, but it wasn't like sensual.  It was a peck.  Yeah.  And they were doing it for a TV show.  Yeah.  You know, when I was watching Borat last night,  this probably means nothing to anybody.  But you know the hooker that he kind of picks up in the movie?  Yeah.  You know that she was one of the comedians that did the pilot with us?  That's right.  And I didn't even know what we were doing with us.  You didn't know that?  No!  Oh, right.  I did not know that.  We did a pilot for Comedy Central.  They never got back to us, by the way, for the people that are wondering.  They officially never got back to us about our pilot. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, that's how it works.  I understand.  But what's her name, Jimmy?  Sherry something, I think?  I don't remember.  I don't remember either.  But she's a huge black comedian with dyed blonde hair.  And she was in Borat, and most of us saw the movie.  I'm like, what?  She was the one that did the pilot with us.  I had no idea.  I wasn't even there that day, and I knew she was the one that did the pilot with you guys.  And I loved Borat, but I never made the connection when I saw her. 
[01:03:00]  I didn't love Borat.  I liked it.  I loved it.  I thought it was very...  We watched the second half again last night.  That movie is strong.  Yeah, the more times you watch it, the little things you pick up on that are just...  He's hysterical.  Now, the Pamela Anderson scene, I know we're talking about something that came out a couple  years ago.  She obviously was in on it.  Yeah, I wasn't buying that.  Was the security guards that tackled them pretty hard in the parking lot, were they in  on it?  That's what I can't figure out.  Because now what's fun about Borat, it's like, okay, that person's in on it.  Like the Black Hooker, in on it. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  You know?  You figure out who was brought into the movie and who was surprised by.  By his antics.  Yeah.  Security guards tackling him in the parking lot as Pamela Anderson's running away.  She was definitely in on it.  There's no doubt in my mind.  Yeah.  Were the security guards in on it.  They took him down hard.  Yeah, they did.  But he'll go to great lengths.  Yeah.  They wouldn't have got that close, I don't think, if they weren't in on it.  I don't think it would have got into the parking lot.  All right.  So then the question is, so Borat, Sasha goes, okay, look, I'm going to do this thing. 
[01:04:00]  You've got to make it look real.  So make believe this is really going down and do whatever you have to to, you know.  Face plant me.  Yeah.  Because that's the only other option because they took him down hard right on the pavement.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Opie and Anthony.  Pete Wentz on the way.  And also, a child writes to Santa.  Aw.  And Santa's now in trouble. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Santa's now in trouble.  Uncle Santa.  And we get these stories every year.  There's a Christmas song.  They're not allowed to sing at school anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, because of a dopey mother getting involved.  Rudolph the ****.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't care what you think, because the world is in the valley.  The best of us you can find has been in the valley. 
[01:05:00]  I don't care what you think, because the world is in the valley.  The best of us you can find happiness in misery.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Fallout boy, I don't care.  Catchy as hell, Pete.  Pete Wentz in studio.  How are you, sir?  Pretty good.  Getting up for the day, I guess.  I hear you.  Too early or what?  No, I'm still on L.A. time, so it's like 4.30, I guess.  Yeah, then it's even better. 
[01:05:30]  Right now, definitely for me.  Do you wake up or just kind of stay up?  No, I wake up.  Yeah, yeah, I wake up.  I try to get sleep.  You get a few hours sleep in?  Yeah.  Not living that rock star thing where you stay up all hours and don't wake up until noon?  No, not really.  Well, I mean, I guess the big elephant in the room is that I have a kid.  Yeah.  You know, so it's a little harder to do that.  Seemed like a good idea at the time, huh?  Yeah, it's definitely one of those things where I'm up every three hours anyway, so it's 
[01:06:00]  not that big of a deal.  You were the DJ at a party I was at.  It was a UFC party when Forrest Griffin beat Rampage Jackson that weekend.  And it was Dana White.  It was the worst party ever.  There was like 90 guys and two prostitutes dancing with UFC guys.  It was the worst.  It wasn't the music that was bad.  It was just the fact there were no chicks there.  What the hell are the UFC doing?  I don't know.  I know that I play a lot of really bad 80s music. 
[01:06:30]  I remember that.  That was one of the problems.  I remember the music was a little too quiet.  And I remember when Rampage walked by me, I thought I was literally going to be murdered.  I was like four inches away from him, and it was the scariest moments of my life.  That was the fight where he had problems afterwards, right?  Yeah, he probably had his energy drink binge by that point.  Because we've had him in, and he couldn't have been nicer and sweeter.  We love Rampage.  And we hear he's back on track, which is very, very good news.  No, the problem wasn't the music.  It wasn't the music at all.  It was literally Dana's invite guest was all men, and I was very creeped out by it. 
[01:07:00]  It was just me and stupid Bob Kelly standing there.  You would think the women would love the UFC thing, right?  You'd think.  But no.  No.  All right, Dana's a good friend of ours.  We're going to have to call him and ask him about that.  I think they like some of the guys, but then if they watch it for two seconds and realize  that they're complete maniacs, they kind of think, eh.  Well, they probably picture in their head, you know, eh, I burned dinner one night.  What's that going to be like?  Yeah.  There's no tapping out on the kitchen floor. 
[01:07:30]  You're pretty much taking your beating.  Well, this is what I do for a living.  What's wrong, right?  Yeah.  We have a, I guess we have to ask you, because our Sam put pictures of your penis, which,  look, we've all done it.  I mean, please, what's the use of technology if not to do that and send it to somebody?  What is the point of a camera phone, right?  I'm with you.  Yeah.  What happened?  Did, like, the fan you sent it to, like, give it out, or did it, like, how did that get out?  Well, what I think, the reason, the way I think it got out was it was sent to an ex-girlfriend, 
[01:08:00]  and I think that is how it got out.  I'm not really sure, to be honest with you, you know, or whatever.  And everyone's like, oh, yeah, you know, you must have leaked it on your own, because  it's like, it makes your band way bigger, this and that.  I'll be honest, there's a lot of better ways to make your band bigger than you.  It's like having the entire world walk in on you, taking a dump.  It doesn't hurt, though.  How can an ex-girlfriend not be trusting?  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Well, you know, the thing is, too, that what you should have done is, because the giveaway  is the tattoo, because you've got the stomach tattoo.  It's like, next time you do that, you should just leave the t-shirt down, make sure the tats  are covered.  If the tats are covered, they can never prove it to you.  Jim's a pro at this.  Jim knows how to do this the right way.  I always position my camera so there's no giveaways, there's nothing with me in the  room.  It's like your new book is right there.  Yeah, exactly.  Or there's like a mirror showing my fat face on the side.  I always make sure.  You ever see some of those things, I don't know if they're scams or not, but like an old 
[01:09:00]  teapot that was being sold on eBay, and you could see the guy's reflection in it as he  was taking the picture of it, and he's completely naked.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You could see a subtle reflection of him just gut hanging out, schlong.  That is crazy.  What's the kind of reaction you get from that?  You get like, hey, hi, how you doing?  So, John Mayer's...  That nice one, something like that.  John Mayer's a...  Oh, go ahead.  I think he's asking about compliments on his penis.  Yeah.  Asking if you've gotten compliments. 
[01:09:30]  I mean, like, you know, I don't know.  People don't...  I mean, people always talk to me about it and like, you know, whatever.  I think it's, you know...  I've gotten past it, you know, whatever.  There's like a 24-hour period where I was like, literally didn't want to talk to anybody,  but now I don't really care.  It's kind of funny.  It's like...  Yeah.  It's weird because, like, when you're on tour and you're in arenas, you take, you  know, like, jailhouse showers.  That's what the showers are set up like.  And now I don't care about it at all.  It's like, I can just walk around and it doesn't really bug me, you know?  Before it was like, oh my God, I better wear my, like, bathing suit in there. 
[01:10:00]  Now it's like, everybody's seen the machinery and might as well, it doesn't really matter,  you know?  Just scrub-a-dub.  Yeah.  Was that the first one you took and sent?  Because I...  I'll just describe the pictures briefly.  Not to harp on them in a homoerotic fashion, but I...  Believe me, I understand the setup.  There's a lot of angles you've got to take.  You want it to look...  You want it to look very natural and yet...  Impressive.  Yeah, you don't want it to look like you just stepped out of a freezing shower.  You've got to prepare properly.  Were these just, like, the first shots you took or was there a couple that you took that  you deleted?  You're like, no, that's no good.  That's no good. 
[01:10:30]  I'm sure I did.  I mean, you know, when you...  The beauty of the camera phone is that you take a bad angle and you're like, oh man,  I gotta...  I should have shot my dong from the left side, you know?  I actually positioned a midget next to mine.  So it just looked like you...  One of those small cans of Coke.  Yeah, like a little mini baby root bar.  All right, good.  So, what were you saying about John Mayer? 
[01:11:00]  Well, we're trying to figure out this guy crush thing there, Pete, to be completely honest.  Sam, what were you saying just before Pete came in?  I want to make sure we don't misrepresent this.  No, I just said when I was doing my research online, it said that what he said was that  above the waist, it's all good, but below the waist on guys, he's not interested in that.  Right.  But you would kiss another guy?  I think this was said probably, you know, about five or six years ago, something like  that.  And that was more in a... 
[01:11:30]  It was kind of like a shock value thing, but it was kind of more in the way that, you  know, I'd be going down the street and someone would be like, hey, you're a...  You know, I don't want to say it on air, you know, like, but, you know, whatever, word  for gay people.  Derogatory term.  Derogatory term with gay people, and I'd be like, you know, if that's the worst someone's  going to say about me, I'd be like, yeah, sure, I am one, who cares, you know, whatever.  But, like, there was never a point where I was like, hey, I'm really into men, or something 
[01:12:00]  like that, you know what I'm saying?  I mean, at the same time, can I sit here and tell you, like, Johnny Depp, I know Johnny Depp's  a good-looking guy?  Yeah, he is.  I think he is a good-looking dude, you know, whatever.  Do I want to, you know, give him a BJ?  No.  Would you snuggle with him?  No.  Because, all right, it's, it's, it's, because the weird thing, when I was a kid, I had this  thing with Kiss, when I was a little boy, and it was almost like, I have to look at it and  go, that it was beyond just, like, being a kid liking, did I have, like, a thing for 
[01:12:30]  them?  I wanted them to hug me.  It wasn't like I just, like, rocked out with them.  But as a band?  Yes.  A whole band?  That wasn't just one guy?  I think Paul was my favorite.  Paul?  Yeah, of course, but I wanted them to hurt me.  Run your fingers through his hairy chest?  No, I didn't want to do that.  No?  No.  Are you sure?  Positive.  Okay.  Just asking.  Well, maybe we think that, like, any time you have an affectionate feeling for another  man, that there's got to be some homoeroticism to it, and it's not.  Right.  Yeah, it's not.  You could just be buddies.  But you wanted to be held by Kiss. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, you tell that classic story where you, what was it?  It was a dream or something?  No, it was a recurring daydream where Kiss would beat me, and this is the truth, they would  hurt me and throw me down the stairs with their makeup on, and then they would hug me  and love me and make everything better while I cried.  That was when I was, like, seven and eight years old.  What a ghoul you are.  That was my recurring fantasy.  It was like, it's all right, and they would just comfort me and wipe my tears.  It was just creepy.  But they did it.  Have you guys had them in?  Oh, yeah, and he made me actually tell Paul Stanley the story.  Yeah, many times.  And Paul hugged me.  Yeah, it was kind of nice. 
[01:13:30]  Paul hugged you.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, but Anthony hates Gene Simmons.  Ah, yeah.  Let's not bring it up right now.  Gene is a tool.  I could take away from the Pete Wentz interview that is going down right now.  You, um, you, now in 2005, is this accurate?  We never know if our stuff is accurate or not.  Did you really take an overdose on purpose?  Was that, like, were you really going to check out?  I think it was, uh, it was like a shut my head off kind of thing.  I've never sat here.  Everyone else sat here and said, you know, like, oh, it was a suicide attempt.  You were trying to kill yourself.  But, you know what?  At that point in my life, I just wanted to turn my head off. 
[01:14:00]  I wanted to turn my brain off kind of.  What was going on with it?  Ah, man, so much.  I was, you know, you know, I was being prescribed a lot of stuff,  and I was mixing them together because I thought I knew better than the doctor.  And the more stuff you mix together, the stranger your brain chemistry gets,  and you start thinking weird things, you know what I'm saying?  And it wasn't smart.  I wouldn't recommend anyone do it.  I'm glad I, you know, a lot of people were like, yo, those are, like, that was your best record. 
[01:14:30]  Those are, you know, the best shows I ever saw.  Like, dude, those, like, four years or three years of my life were a total haze  where I hated myself and didn't want to be around.  And so I'm glad I made it out.  And so for when people go, oh, that was awesome, it's kind of always weird for me  because I'm, like, I didn't even like myself at it at all.  I've got to ask you, what was the weirdest thought you had during that period that you could remember?  Because I think that's really, really interesting.  Man, well, a lot of times I was taking, like, Klonopin, and then I was taking Xanax. 
[01:15:00]  I mean, sorry, I was taking Klonopin, and then I was taking Ambien.  And I would have all kinds of, like, the Ambien ones were weird.  I had to have my friends record me because I would just say weird stuff.  Like, there was one where I was, like, it was recording where I was, like,  oh, you want to talk to Pete?  You can't talk to Pete right now.  He's not here right now.  You can't talk to Pete, you know, or whatever.  It's, like, Ambien's a weird thing, man.  Like, don't take that and stay up, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  A real weird side of you comes out, you know?  Yeah.  I knew somebody who would night cook on Ambien.  What's night cook mean?  Would get up and start cooking.  Oh, right, right, right.  And not finish things and go to sleep.  Right.  And, you know, the stove would be on fire.  People, yeah, I hear about it.  Like, there's night sex.  Jack Nicholson talks about how he woke up in his car out just, like, 
[01:16:00]  in this, out behind his house or whatever, and he was like,  I'm not going to take that anymore, you know?  Now, when you said you were, like, trying to shut off the head,  because, I mean, I've kind of been there at one point, so I definitely get that.  Were you saying, like, all right, I'm going to take X amount of things, and you took it,  and what actually, like, what was happening that night, or what stopped the process?  Like, what stopped it?  I was on the phone with my manager, and he heard me slurring my words,  and at that point, I didn't, you know, drink at all, and it was like he knew something was going on, 
[01:16:30]  and I was being really weird or whatever, and he called my mom.  Mom called me, and my mom, you know, it's kind of like a lame whatever story,  but, like, that's just how it happened.  My mom picked me up and went to the hospital, and, you know, the rest is history, I guess.  Did it pump your stomach?  Yeah, they do the charcoal thing, and, you know, whatever.  It's not a whole lot of fun.  Yeah, I did what I did when I was a teenager, you know, the cutting thing,  but then it was bad, and I knocked on the door and woke my parents.  You know, it's, like, embarrassing.  You look back on it.  So embarrassing.  I'm cutting.  Yeah, oh, I'm a cutter.  Notice me.  It's so embarrassing, you know.  You couldn't just wait until someone noticed. 
[01:17:00]  You had to be, like, you know.  That's the part that's humiliated.  Yeah, yeah.  If they had just busted in on a whim and seen me lay in there, like, all right, I gave it a shot,  and, you know, whatever, I missed.  But this was one where I was, like, you know, I just wanted a little attention, and then I knocked on it.  I'm a cutter because of you.  Oh, shit.  Yuck.  I'm always interested in other people's vibes.  Yeah, sometimes you've got to kind of not think so much.  Isn't there?  Don't you think, like, people that are kind of stupid are kind of lucky? 
[01:17:30]  Totally.  Because it's like I hate when you're sitting there and thinking too much.  That's why I get goofed on a lot because I leave the TV on at night,  and I, you know, fall asleep with something on.  Because I don't like just laying there with my own thoughts.  Sometimes they run to nasty places.  Yeah, me too.  And it's, like, it's bonkers because it's, like, at that point, it's, like, I feel like anxiety generalizes so fast.  It's, like, I wasn't flying on airplanes, and then soon I didn't want to get in cars.  I didn't want to get on elevators.  Wow. 
[01:18:00]  You become adoraphobic.  Yeah, it happens so fast, you know, and it's, like, I don't know.  I think a lot more people go through it than, you know, at some point in their life than the world would like to admit.  And the funny thing about, kind of, I think about America is we want people to be happy all the time,  and, like, you know, we never want people to be, like, it's okay that you're down, you're feeling kind of crummy.  Let's get you feeling better rather than just being, like, put on a smile, you know what I'm saying?  Like, figure out your life.  Yeah, I went through some crap like that with anxiety for, like, a couple of years. 
[01:18:30]  And never understood it, you know, where it came from or what the hell or, like, what it would do to you if you let it just go.  You always think you're going to end up in a straitjacket, you know, running around a padded room.  And then I remember one day I was just so fed up with it.  Did it just click off?  No, I said to myself, okay, whatever is going to happen is going to happen.  I'm going to rip my clothes off, run down the street, and end up in a mental institution. 
[01:19:00]  Go ahead.  I don't care at this point.  Right.  And nothing happened.  And then after that, it got better.  Yeah, I literally could not, like, when our band was breaking, like, from under the cork tree, I could not get on an airplane.  We drove everywhere.  Wow.  And then everyone was like, it's going to end.  One day it's just going to click off and you're going to be fine.  And I swear to God, one day it just did.  Did the rest of the band fly?  Yeah.  Some of them were nice guys and would ride with me, you know, give me company. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Yeah, the first time I flew in years, and it was because of anxiety, was when we had to go out to L.A.  For the X Games?  No, no, no.  That was the first time we flew to Boston from Boston to L.A.  Oh, gotcha.  Right, right.  That was the first time in years I had flown because I always put it off.  I was petrified, you know.  And then I had to get on this plane because it was, you know, a great gig.  And you can't really drive cross-country when you have to be there by Monday.  That's why I drank a case of beer before I even walked on the airplane. 
[01:20:00]  Well, that explains a lot of things now.  Oof.  They cut them off on the plane.  How many people get cut off on a plane?  I was nice about it.  Two people in history, you and Richard Reed, the shoe bomber, have been cut off from alcohol on a plane.  I had a paralyzing fear of it, too.  I thought it was going to hurt my career because I would not get on a plane.  And I finally said, okay, I'll fly.  I had to go to a festival in Denver.  And we're halfway through the flight.  And they're like, ah, ladies and gentlemen, we have a problem with the fuel transfer. 
[01:20:30]  We're going to have to make an unscheduled landing in Chicago.  So they're jettisoning fuel out the wings.  And this is like when I finally muster up the courage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they have to shoot fuel out and then land.  It was hard.  It was hard.  And the woman next to me was really old, and she had dumpster breath.  I'll never forget the old lady with horrible breath sitting next to me.  We're going to light the fuel so it looks cool.  What?  You know, those guys can handle it.  They might as well make it look cool for everybody else.  So you're married? 
[01:21:00]  I am.  And you have a kid.  It's almost like a normal life.  Is it changing the way you do business outside, or has it changed nothing?  What do you mean as far as business?  Just touring and the way you carry yourself in the career.  I mean, aside from the obvious, yeah, you have to get less sleep.  Yeah.  I mean, I find myself, like, going into dad mode.  Like, we're playing shows, and I see kids in the front row getting crushed.  And I'm like, the dad in me wants to be like, hey, chill out, you know, calm down a little bit.  That's so odd, man.  That is weird.  It's weird because it's like it flips on, too, you know? 
[01:21:30]  It's a really – it's the most, like, cliche thing.  Everyone, you know, everyone's like, you change, it does – you are going to change.  But, like, I swear to God, it really is true.  Yeah.  My brother said that because he just had a kid, and he's like, yeah, when I got to leave, go on a gig or something like that.  He goes, you know, she'll look at me and stuff, and I could kind of tell this thing is starting where it's like she kind of knows I'm going somewhere.  And he goes, when it gets to the point where she's like, oh, do you have to go, Daddy? 
[01:22:00]  He goes, that's going to be a problem.  Really?  Yeah.  This is my brother who didn't give a flying F about anything.  He just could do his drugs.  Ah, yeah.  Whatever.  And then, boom, he has a kid, and I was called falling asleep next to the bean pod in, like, Invasion of the Body Snatchers because it's like, no, I don't want to.  I don't want to do this.  I don't want to.  And then you wake up.  It was all fine.  Please join us.  Why didn't you – and then you're a dad, and everything revolves around your kid. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  I'm not.  You're living for someone else.  It's strange.  It's cool.  So I can, you know, run off places and do whatever the hell I want.  This might sound like a stupid Charlie Rose question.  I'm curious because I'm not a parent.  What one quality in yourself or what part of your personality would you really not want to pass on?  I would definitely not want to pass on my – I think I have a big mouth.  I tend to talk a lot, and I have a short fuse. 
[01:23:00]  I wouldn't want to pass on either of those.  I'm also a short guy, so that's the physical trait I would not want to pass on.  Are you one of those – like a lot of those little dudes.  It's like Curly from Mice and Men, I think his name was.  Those little dudes that just don't like big guys that are always like kind of making up for the fact that they're –  Yeah, I'm not like – I don't have a Napoleon complex.  I'm not always trying to fight people or anything like that.  Like I size it up.  I realize that I'm going to get beat up, you know, or whatever.  But at the same time, I don't want my kid like – I want his life to be as known as possible. 
[01:23:30]  I don't want him to have to grow up and, you know, have to, you know, hear like, oh, your dad's a D-bag, you know, like, you know, for the rest of his life or whatever.  So at some point, I'm going to have to become an undie bag on the Internet somehow.  Yeah.  And the fact that I said – they said that about Napoleon, somebody should have knocked the microphone into my teeth.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I just like – like I had an insight.  You know, by the way, Napoleon, people say they had a problem. 
[01:24:00]  When you're in the arts, though, it's a lot easier because a lot of actors are of shorter stature, a lot of music.  You look at, you know, Sully from Godsmack.  I know.  He's a short guy, but he carries himself like, you know.  No one's going to tell him he's short.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can learn how to box from an early age.  Pete, you've got a real busy day.  I'm here and you only have a few minutes left here, and we want to get some of this info out.  Free Nokia show in Times Square today.  We are, yeah.  Fall Out Boy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're playing at the Nokia Theater, which is pretty exciting.  For free?  Yeah, and that's what's cool about it. 
[01:24:30]  It's because it's like when I realize there's – as a band, when we realize there's a recession, the first thing to go is the arts, you know what I'm saying.  Music, that's the first thing that really gets cut, you know.  And so it's good to be able to play for your fans and play a free show and give back a little bit.  We tried to play for free at Washington Square Park yesterday.  We just showed up with acoustic guitars, and the police were not happy.  It fell miserably.  They told us we would be arrested.  When the Beatles did it and you two did it, everyone looked the other way. 
[01:25:00]  But Fall Out Boy.  We showed up and we were told if we could pick up our guitars, we'd be arrested.  You need a permit tax.  Dude, there's homeless people playing chess for drug night in Washington Square Park.  Jimmy, there's homeless people playing guitars.  You should have picked up your guitars and just taken the hit.  It's amazing.  Were there a lot of fans there?  Because I'm sure it got out on the Internet and all that.  Yeah, a lot of kids showed up, but it was really calm and it was really easy and, you know, whatever.  You win some, you lose some or whatever.  But the cool thing is that, you know, tonight's going to be free, and it's also going to be, you know, webcast in L.A. as well at the same time. 
[01:25:30]  So it should be a cool, fun show.  What do the cops get you on?  Just some kind of permit thing?  Oh, yes.  It's all about whether we have a permit or not.  I think I don't really know.  I mean, I...  You can just slap disorderly on anything.  I think that...  You know what?  But we need a little fun out there.  Let the Fallout boys play a little.  I don't think people like fun anymore.  No.  It doesn't seem like it, you know? 
[01:26:00]  You need a fun tax.  Yeah.  You can't just go with something anymore.  Everything has to be like, all right, you've got to follow the rules, you've got to get your permits, you've got to get this.  Yeah, at least...  People let some of this stuff happen.  People don't like free fun at least.  You know, they want there to be like a ticket and a wristband and like, you can buy a, you know, whatever hot dog there or whatever.  It's like...  Yeah, that's too bad.  You know?  And then you've got Letterman tonight.  That's huge.  Yeah, that'll be a blast.  That's always fun.  So you guys got...  A couple things you're promoting.  I mean, the website's PeteWentz.com.  And you guys are tonight doing a signing at 11.30 p.m. 
[01:26:30]  It's at Virgin here in New York in Times Square, and it's only for an hour.  So I guess people should probably get there early.  Yeah.  They're only signing for an hour tonight.  And the new CD, the new Fall Out Boy CD, how do you say it?  Fully I do.  But to be honest with you, if we were hanging out with anyone who spoke French here, they  would tell us we were doing it wrong.  Really?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter how you say it.  And they think it's really funny.  Like, we'll go on French radio shows, and they're speaking, and then they go into this 
[01:27:00]  like American joke accent when they say Fully I Do.  Oh, really?  And then they all laugh, and we're kind of sitting there, and our translator's like  a nice guy, so he won't be like, oh, they're making fun of you right now.  What does it mean?  It means the shared madness of two.  So it was like a French psychological term from the 30s, and it's relevant in the way  that one person's psychosis and another person's psychosis kind of come together and create  one.  So you could think about it in the way of Britney Spears and the paparazzi, or Dick Cheney 
[01:27:30]  and George Bush, or like, it's so relatable, it's just like, and it's an untreatable thing.  It's like, you know, these two people become so crazy, but it's like their own form of  craziness, you know?  And I think a lot of people have gone through that in relationships, you know?  I don't know.  It's like they say, two sick ones don't make a healthy one.  Exactly.  I've heard that in every single relationship I've ever been in.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Keep trying to find a sicker one.  That's what you do, it's like, because I have major problems, so you try to find someone  that's more of a psychopath than you are, so you feel healthy. 
[01:28:00]  Good luck with that.  Yes, and you can abandon them someday.  You're downplaying the whole thing that happened in Washington Square Park, so the cops show  up and then there was an impromptu sing-along?  Yeah, the kids were pretty cool.  Patrick was there, and we just decided, we sang a cappella, and it was fun, it was a good  time, you know, anyway, and no one got arrested, so.  All right.  Well, we'll get you out of here.  Pete, you're all right, man.  Well, I didn't know what to think, because, you know, you got a lot of stuff going on 
[01:28:30]  out there, and you're, what am I trying to say, you're, we enjoyed the interview.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Very honest guy.  We like that.  I appreciate it.  A lot of you guys come in and it's like, ah, man, the penis thing, I don't want to talk  about, I don't want to talk about that.  And then you sit there like, well, what do you want to talk about, dummy?  Yeah.  You know, it's good that you're honest, so.  Why don't we play a track from the new CD, Fall Out Boy, America's Sweetheart.  Thank you, Pete Wentz.  Thanks, guys.  This is America's Sweetheart.  It happened again. 
[01:29:00]  Opie and Anthony had a fine interview with Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy.  He was very cool.  He was very, like you said, he was very honest about everything.  That's not what I'm talking about.  As soon as we went to break, he stands up, looks right at Jimmy.  Hey, where do we hang out?  I hung out with you.  Where was it?  He was all confused.  He's looking at Jimmy.  And then they're going through some things.  And Jimmy goes, ah, the UFC thing.  No, no, no, no, no.  We hung out recently.  I saw what was happening, so I just went, hey, Jimmy's a comedian. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You probably saw him on TV.  Right.  And he goes, yes, that was it.  His special.  Another big star.  Really hysterical, funny.  Another big star recognizing Jimmy.  It is.  It's happening all the time now, and it just sickens us.  It's one of those silly things where, like, a lot of times a couple of celebrities will  bump into each other, and, like, we know each other's faces, but we're not exactly sure  where, and then we laugh about it after.  A couple of celebrities?  You don't just mean a couple of people of similar ilk?  Yeah.  No, I used the ilk too many times.  I love the similar ilk. 
[01:30:00]  Shatner and I were of similar ilk.  Similar ilk.  You're just reworking the bit now.  Yeah, it turns out Shatner's a Norton fanatic.  It's an easy build.  I know, I know.  He didn't go that far.  He's obsessed.  Calm down.  Shatner was obsessed.  Keep it between the lines here.  He sort of recognized you.  I know.  But P. Wentz, no, he knew exactly, and he said you were hilarious.  Yeah.  He says your special was hilarious and really dirty, and he liked that.  Yeah.  Very cool.  We've got to bring that to the people.  I'm happy HBO's showing it.  It's always good when they show it. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  A couple quick hits.  Where was that?  The Madonna thing.  We don't care about that, do we?  What is it?  She gave Guy Ritchie 76 million to go away.  Who cares?  That's easy for her.  I don't care.  She's got a bag of shells.  That's easy.  She doesn't want it.  She just wants to move on.  She's got the money.  She's got to be close to a billionaire at this point, right?  Someone like Madonna.  Been doing it.  Never went away.  Yeah, how long her career's gone, how many hit albums she's had.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  So she, I think that's over.  It seems like it's over officially.  And there was something else that I can't remember now.  So, Arena Football is canceling their 2009 season.  Not a lot of Arena Football fans.  Not a lot of many people, no.  I think it's some of the big cities, yes, but no.  I know the Islanders would give away, like, free tickets if you were a season ticket holder for the hockey.  Here's what it is.  You never hear anyone that's going.  Or you never hear anyone that came back from a game and said, yeah, I went. 
[01:31:30]  It was this, that.  You know, they don't talk about it like they do football, baseball, basketball, hockey.  It's just there.  It's like lacrosse is another thing.  I know there's lacrosse fanatics out there.  Just shut your mouths.  You're not packing joints out like it's the Super Bowl.  It's a great sport, though.  A lot of hitting.  I like the lacrosse.  I wouldn't go to it.  Lacrosse.  Lacrosse game. 
[01:32:00]  And I think it was some radio thing we had to do up in Boston, some crap.  And we were sitting there waiting to come out and wave to the crowd and throw some t-shirts at them.  And there was, like, an old Indian guy sitting there.  Mmm.  Like, apparently that's an old Indian sport.  It sure is.  And he was sitting there.  And I'm like, wow.  It was the original fan.  So there was a little lacrosse t-shirt on.  Who watches that?  They're probably playing on his ground.  Yeah.  His family used to live there until it was taken by some college. 
[01:32:30]  It's like watching a bunch of white people play something in his yard.  He's tired of it.  Who are these crapers?  Colonizing animals we are.  There's something else.  It's driving me nuts, but I can't remember.  So we'll move on.  It'll hit me.  It was a good one, too.  We do have a child getting Santa in trouble, though.  This is a great story.  A child writes to Santa.  Now, obviously, the wrong toy.  Santa gets in trouble.  That happens all the time.  Did you ever write a letter to Santa? 
[01:33:00]  Let me think.  I was a big letter writer as a kid.  And I used to send for stuff.  I was always writing somebody.  I told you I wrote around Christmas time.  I wrote a Christmas card out and sent it to Richard Nixon.  And I got one back.  And I think it was stamped.  Of course it was.  I wanted it to be personal.  Of course it was stamped.  Hello, Anthony.  Fellow Jew hater.  He was quite the anti-Semite. 
[01:33:30]  If you want autographs from really big, big celebrities, it's easy now.  Because they don't get a lot of letters in the mail.  Back then, I'm sure there was hundreds coming in every day.  So what do you want?  Richard Nixon to sit there and sign every single thing?  But now I bet you some of these really huge superstars, they would probably sign something real fast and throw it back.  You made it easy for them.  I would do that.  I would send away for things like, you know, you've got to cut the box tops off of sugar-frosted flakes and send in the little card. 
[01:34:00]  And I got something called a Tony Tiger swimmer.  And he looked like he was swimming.  His arms were in swimming position and a rubber band was between them.  And you wound up his arms.  And then in the bathtub, you would make you feel good.  Yeah.  You would put it in there and you would swim around the bathtub.  It was fun for about five minutes.  I was a little kid.  So I would go out.  Like, I sent the letter out. 
[01:34:30]  And the next day, I'm out by the mailbox.  And it was like four to six weeks it took to be delivered.  And I had no concept of time because I was merely a child.  And my mother was probably laughing at me because every day I'd go out.  It's not here yet.  It's like, dummy, it's been two days.  Did your dad hear you whining about your Tony the Tiger toy?  He wasn't there.  He was in Connecticut screwing his gomar, his girlfriend.  Oh, Ro, yeah.  How you doing?  Wait a minute.  Hi, Ro?  Yes, Joey. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, business.  I'm going to be stuck in Connecticut tonight.  You take quarters out of vending machines.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of them up here in Connecticut.  Have fun with your whore.  Okay.  Oh, you got me.  That was...  She knew?  Of course she knew.  Dad had a little whore.  A whore!  Connecticut, you have a whore living in your state! 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Well, this kid wrote a letter to Santa asking for molestation to end.  To end?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  I thought it was Santa molesting the child.  That's what I thought.  When I first saw this on the old internet, maybe I looked at it a little too quickly.  I thought Santa was up to no good.  But a child writes to Santa, asks for molestation to end.  A Texas man has been arrested after a nine-year-old girl wrote to Santa asking that a relative stop touching her and her sister. 
[01:36:00]  Hanging her pink stocking over the fireplace.  Her pink sock.  Her pink sock.  Well, went for the stocking thing.  Was hung over the PJs with care.  Uncle Paul's nuts roasting on an open phone.  Criminal complaint says the girl turned the letter in at her elementary school. 
[01:36:30]  Hoping that Santa was going to read her a letter.  Santa doesn't exist, you dummy.  But the authorities got involved.  Interviewed the girl after a school counselor reported the letter.  Complaint says investigators believe the molestation occurred over a period of four years.  Wow.  The man is charged with continuous sexual abuse of a young child and could face as many as 99 years in prison if convicted.  Why not round it up to 100?  Round it up.  What are you doing?  100 years.  100 years.  Wow. 
[01:37:00]  Letter to Santa.  That's the guy.  Hello.  I would like a dolly and an easy bake oven and I don't want my uncle's **** in my **** anymore.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you think it was a whole list?  Yeah, I'd like to know what that was.  And you can't put it right at the top.  And the molestation.  You can't have it as number one.  No, you've got to ease into it.  You've got to ease into it.  Some other things.  Can't be at the bottom, though.  They're not going to read the whole list on you.  No, no, no.  Slip it in there.  I'd say three or four. 
[01:37:30]  After molestation, then you kind of...  And then you go back to toys.  Yeah, yeah.  I want a wee.  You want something.  A wee.  And then we've got this story, another cute Christmas story.  We've got a mommy getting involved.  And, boy, when you mommies get involved, people listen and shut down everything.  Do you know what I mean?  And ruin the fun for everyone else.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  The holiday staple was nearly banned from a school concert in North Carolina.  And that is because a parent complained that Rudolph carries religious overtones. 
[01:38:00]  When the song was...  I was going to say I've sang that song.  I don't really sing Christmas songs.  But I've heard that song, like everyone else, hundreds of times.  Where's the religious overtones in that?  I would love to know where the religious overtones are because they're not there.  I'm sure we're going to find out, but do you know off the top of your head?  I would...  All I would think of is because it's Christmas-based.  It's not a multi...  No, not the song literally. 
[01:38:30]  No.  Huh?  Not literally the song.  Figuratively, the whole thing with Santa Claus and everything.  Then that would mean every Christmas song.  She had a problem with this particular one.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you think this was the only song they were singing, maybe?  Yeah, so it's for religions that practice, that participate in Christmas.  So what happened?  What are the Muslims to do?  What are the Muslims going to do?  I don't...  Well, I don't think she's...  Aided.  Religious overtones.  When the song was scratched, pro-Rudolph parents rebelled. 
[01:39:00]  So will the kids be able to sing freely at their next concert?  So start out by telling us, what was so offensive about Rudolph to this parent  that she complained of the school and the school board and lawyers got involved?  Well, the problem has it.  Lawyers got involved.  That's when the fun starts, when the lawyers get involved.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the problem, Heather, was the words Christmas and Santa used in the song. 
[01:39:30]  The parent felt that they carried religious overtones that she didn't want her daughter  to be exposed to in a secular public school setting.  Okay, well, if they objected to the words Rudolph and Christmas,  that has certainly got to be a new role.  Santa and Christmas, dummy.  They objected to Santa and Christmas in the song.  Then one foggy, non-secular holiday eve.  Do you think they're taking Christmas?  A big fat f*** did say. 
[01:40:00]  Do you think they're taking Christmas?  They're going to take Christmas away from the school system?  They've been doing it for years.  Not Christmas.  Yes.  It's holidays now.  They call it the holidays.  As we become more and more diverse as a nation, instead of people being tolerant and allowing  people to do things, especially things that have been traditions over years, it just gets  taken away so we don't offend.  So it's not offensive to everybody else.  Someone puts up a Christmas tree, a menorah's got to go next to it. 
[01:40:30]  And then some Muslim's got to put a severed head next to the whole thing to show what they do.  It's just disgusting.  It really is.  A town in Washington had a display from the atheists put up that said organized religion is a hoax.  And then someone came and petitioned for a Festivus poll to be put up.  Festivus poll.  They are putting up a Festivus poll in Washington State.  But if you ask people, I mean, the whole religious angle with Christmas? 
[01:41:00]  That was the second funniest thing Kramer ever did.  But if you ask people, the whole religion thing has been taken out of Christmas a long time.  Who really thinks religion when they are running around to these malls getting a gift for everybody  on their dumb list?  Do you really think religion when you think Christmas?  No, but it's just the fact that you say.  It's just the fact that you're celebrating Christmas.  I know what it's based on originally, but...  It's guilt by association. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  But, I mean, a very small percent of people actually celebrate the religious angle of Christmas.  Dude, that is long gone.  When you're standing in a crowded mall after 20 minutes trying to find a parking space  and standing in a checkout line with 30 people, 30 morons on it and a moron behind the counter,  the last thing you're thinking is religion.  That's the last thing you're thinking.  The first thing you're thinking is I'd love to just take a swipe at these people with a machete. 
[01:42:00]  Uh-huh.  This horrid, oh, the parking lots with the people that don't know how to drive.  And I understand a car is pulling out and you have your blinker on and you're ready to go.  Total rights, total rights to that spot.  I'm not trying to take it, but you know something?  Move over!  Move over!  So that people can get around you as you're waiting 20 minutes for some reason for somebody 
[01:42:30]  to check the systems like they're taking off in the shuttle to leave the parking lot.  How long does it take to turn that goddamn key and put it in reverse?  That's a weird human nature thing.  Dude!  When you know, when that person knows that you're waiting for the spot,  something in human nature takes over.  You're like, I'm going to take my time.  You know, I'm not ready to give up my spot.  What is that about, really?  I put my seatbelt on and I quickly, I don't care if the other people are barely in the car. 
[01:43:00]  I'm getting out of there.  Dude, I am that's-how-it's-done guy.  Yeah.  I am that's-how-it's-done guy.  And I never say it, but I want to.  If you're at a pharmacy and you're picking up a prescription or whatever,  you know, you're at a line at a store, I don't care what it is,  you're always behind somebody that is taking forever.  They're trying to pay with rubles.  And then you get up there and finally you just go, yes, Kumiya. 
[01:43:30]  There they go.  They grab it.  Here's some money.  I take it away and I want to turn to the line and go, that's how it's done.  Two seconds.  When I get in my car, I start it up.  I put it in reverse.  I pull out.  I want to go, that's how it's done.  Two seconds.  That's useless because the people you're yelling it to could be the that's-how-it's-done people.  You should, as you're waiting behind.  No one's, that's-how-it's-done. 
[01:44:00]  Me, I'm alone.  As you're waiting for the dummy in front of you, you should be yelling, that's not how it's done.  Yeah, but then you start a big thing.  Nothing wrong with starting a big thing.  It's okay.  They're always, and no one knows how to step over to the side and deal with someone else.  When a cashier comes up, and I'll bring up a prescription thing again because pharmacies are a cavalcade, just a collection of idiots.  It's either behind the counter, but usually as customers. 
[01:44:30]  They will walk up, ask for their prescription, and then for some reason there's an insurance problem.  It's not filled yet.  And they will argue with the person that is ringing everyone up instead of stepping to the side and waiting to speak to somebody else so the person behind you, the poor son of a bitch behind you, can continue his business and be the that's-how-it's-done guy.  But it's never that way. 
[01:45:00]  And why put the insured to get the insured?  But the last time I get-  And out loud you just go, oh, brother, here it comes.  And you start looking at each other online.  Oh, it's infuriating.  That's really funny.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, I love using my remote start of my truck.  It turns on the reverse lights and people will sit there with their blinker on waiting and waiting and waiting. 
[01:45:30]  And you just start from another part of the parking lot.  That's fun, too.  There are fun games you can play, especially during this time of year.  Take your keys out and overshoot your car or undershoot your car by an aisle.  And you'll watch a car follow you, follow you, take your keys out like you're getting into a car, and then walk right past it to your car way in the other aisle.  Yeah.  Oh, will they be angry?  That's pretty funny. 
[01:46:00]  Back to the Rudolph story.  Mother had a problem with the song being practiced in music class.  Seeing lawyers involved in all of that, which I can picture them right now reading through the lyrics of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer  and then writing up an opinion and giving it to the school board.  Do we have any idea how much time or how much money this cost the school district and taxpayers?  No, actually not sure about that.  I do know the decision came from the school board fairly quickly later in the day after we got word of the story. 
[01:46:30]  Okay.  What is the mom saying who objected to this?  And why does she just not keep her kid home if she was so offended by the song?  Nice.  Bravo.  Well, her problem with the song being sung was that it was being practiced during school hours in music class.  Though the concert was optional, music class was not.  And she felt that public school meant to be secular and she didn't want her daughter to have to hear the words Christmas or Santa Claus.  Yeah, because that's going to hurt her.  Good.  Someone needs attention.  Mommy needs attention.  Oh, she needs so much attention. 
[01:47:00]  Go put Lysol in your kid's soup if you want attention.  It's a terrible solution.  Of course it is, but it gets your attention.  The hospital.  Oh, how's my child?  Making friends with all the doctors.  You Munchausen bitch.  She's teetering on Munchausen, this woman.  They all are.  Whenever they can make a big to-do about stupid lyrics in a school thing, they're one step away from dumping industrial cleaner into their kid's cutlet. 
[01:47:30]  Didn't we invent Santa to take the whole religious thing away from the holiday?  Yeah.  If you really think about it.  We changed it from St. Nicholas to Santa Claus.  Right, because it was a-  Sounds the same kind of.  In the older days, it was a bore fest with the mangers and crap.  We had to jazz it up.  We took the religious thing out of it.  Holy night.  You know, there are some severe religious Christmas songs. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Say this is holy.  Oh, baby.  Jesus.  I got a great Christmas song in front of me here.  Yeah?  No, you don't.  Oh, yeah, I do.  No, you don't.  Oh, yeah, I do, Jimmy.  No!  Oh, yeah, I do.  Oh.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John.  What's up, boys?  Hi, John.  Hello.  So I live in Staten Island, the most racist of all boroughs, by the way.  Yes.  They actually changed We Wish You a Merry Christmas, the lyrics, at my daughter's school play.  They put it, We Wish You a Merry Christmas, We Wish You a Happy Hanukkah, and We Wish 
[01:48:30]  You a Happy Id, which is like some kind of beheading video, beheading holiday or something.  Is that a Muslim thing?  What about Kwanzaa?  You know what?  They didn't throw that in.  It was surprising.  I think there's like two black kids at my daughter's school, tops.  Wait, they made it?  So You a Merry Christmas, We Wish You a Happy Hanukkah, We Wish...  Get out of here!  Why aren't you parents outraged?  I blame you guys.  You guys got to stand up and go, this is boomer!  Be the guy that stands up and says, this is BS. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, it's not going to change anything, though.  Well, yeah, maybe it will.  It will, though, if you guys fight back a little bit.  Push back a little.  Push back.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, we hung him on a cross.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  You know, let's start changing around Jewish lyrics.  Enough!  All right, boys, I got to run.  No, John, we got something for you.  You got to be the guy.  You got to start this.  You got to be the BS guy.  I will try, boys.  All right.  Oh, they changed another song?  I did not know this was going on.  Joe, how are you, Joe? 
[01:49:30]  Joe!  Hey, Joe.  That's a good call, too.  What did they change?  A daughter's school changed lyrics to Deck the Halls.  To Deck the Mom Who Changed the Lyrics.  Fa-la-la-la-la.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  A Wisconsin school changed Silent Night to Cold in the Night.  Why?  What?  What's called Silent Night?  They secularized all the lyrics.  Yeah.  Silent Night.  Cold in the Night. 
[01:50:00]  No one in sight.  Winter winds whirl and bite.  How I wish I were happy and warm and safe with my family out of the storm.  This is getting so bad.  I blame the parents.  I'm not even religious.  I'm not a practicing Catholic.  I enjoy Christmas because it's just like, I hate the shopping part of it and stuff, but  there is this weird kind of little feeling you get, like that you know it's Christmas.  I kind of like that.  I did my tree last night.  Did you?  I've been collecting ornaments since I've been with my girl. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah?  We got about four days.  Do you have your first Christmas together ornament?  Yes!  Did you hang it on the tree with that in your hands?  No, no, no.  Come on, you did too.  No, not that bad.  You're turning red.  No, not that bad.  No?  No.  Who hung it on the tree?  I don't remember who hung that one.  Yes, you do.  I swear to God.  It's a very important ornament.  My girl's mom gives me Christmas ornaments every year and has something to do.  Our first Christmas!  It has something to do.  Shut up.  That means you did it. 
[01:51:00]  I had one, of course.  But she gives a...  Threw it at her when she was drinking.  She's got a sense of humor, too, because one year she gave me a Christmas ornament that  looked like a bikini-tini.  And then when we bought our house, it was our first Christmas and our new house.  That crap, right?  Aw.  So, I know people are going to their radios, but I bring this up because I share a little  bit with Kenny on the way in, right?  Just a little bit.  Try to have a little human interaction with this effing robot. 
[01:51:30]  Don't you need another human?  Yeah, exactly.  The Japanese, they're not doing this right.  If they want robots, they should get Kenny, fly him over to Japan.  Model him.  Cut him open and see what makes him a robot.  And then you would have the perfect robot girl.  So, I go, Kenny, this is what I did.  And, you know, my girl's mom gave her all her ornaments over the years because now that  she's married, you really should have these instead of me putting them on my tree.  You get what I'm getting at.  Very sentimental.  It's Christmas, like you were saying.  You get that feeling.  But this is where it gets weird. 
[01:52:00]  So, I tell Kenny all this.  He goes, I put up my Christmas tree yesterday, too.  I'm like, oh, nice.  You got some ornaments from over the years?  No.  He gets a fake Christmas tree, which a lot of people get, right?  Sure.  He gets the fake Christmas tree that already has the lights and the ornaments on it.  Wow.  Why bother?  There's nothing personal about your tree whatsoever.  Comes out of the box.  Comes out of the box with the lights and the ornaments on it already.  And he gets fake holly and he spray paints it black and he calls it hair. 
[01:52:30]  No, I went with the fake tree.  Which is fine, but you got ornaments at least or something that you're picking out yourself?  No, no, no.  Ange did the whole thing.  All right, but still you're...  Yeah, no, believe me, it was very impersonal on my part.  I'll be honest.  Not like Kenny, though.  No, not like Kenny.  Imagine getting a tree and you take it out of the box.  It's ready to go.  You just have to plug it in.  That's crazy.  My tree, I couldn't do anything with it. 
[01:53:00]  It's 15 feet tall.  Nice.  It's a 15 foot tall tree, so I couldn't...  I wasn't going to stand on ladders trying to decorate this thing.  They almost broke their neck putting the frigging big top piece on.  It was...  They were on the do not use as a step step.  Yeah.  So I was waiting for them to fall into the tree.  That would be hilarious.  That's hilarious.  That would be hilarious.  I made my girl carry the Christmas tree home with me. 
[01:53:30]  Really?  Saved the 10 bucks delivery fee.  You kept...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Do you have sap all over your hands?  It sucks that...  I hate sticky sap.  It sucks that she just has no desire to be on the radio because she would just kill me  on a regular basis.  It would be...  Well, actually, it would be good for the show because...  It really would be.  Who wants to hear their wives and girlfriends on a radio show anyway?  Yeah.  It's, for the most part, boring crap.  But to save 10 bucks, I'm like, come on.  And my whole thinking was, come on.  You can't just have a Christmas tree delivered. 
[01:54:00]  You gotta, like...  Like, you go old school.  You drive up into the country and you cut your own tree.  We can't do that, but the least we can do is carry our Christmas tree home.  Yeah.  In the back of my mind, I'm thinking I'm saving 10 bucks.  How far was it?  It was...  Jimmy knows.  Top of the hill.  It's a long walk, man.  I can't even look at him.  I know where it is.  It's two long city avenues.  And she was bitching the whole time, which she should have. 
[01:54:30]  I'm, like, trying to get her into the Christmas tree.  Like, no, this is good.  We need to do more stuff like this.  What?  Lugging trees?  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  I know where it is.  I had mine shipped last year.  It was two feet off.  And the branches scratched her hand and everything.  Oh.  No, my ornaments aren't little hanging c***s.  Jesus.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Stop.  Whoa, yeah.  People.  And then there was another couple walking.  There was another couple walking down the hill. 
[01:55:00]  And the guy looks at her and goes, you want me to carry this?  I'll carry it the rest of the way for you.  Yeah.  And she kind of wanted him to, but said, no, I guess I got to do this.  You weren't carrying it, too?  I was carrying the heavy end.  I should have gave her the heavy end.  She's younger.  Steve from Bayshore is saying, Opie's trying to turn an 11 into a lumberjack.  At least I carried the heavy end here.  Come on.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, right. 
[01:55:30]  What a gentleman.  I was debating that, though.  I was like, what a gentleman.  Yeah.  You carried the tree.  What's wrong with you?  They would have done it for $10.  Honestly, I'm making more out of it, but I just didn't feel like you should have a Christmas  tree delivered to your apartment.  Dinner, yes.  Takeout food, yes.  But not your tree.  Once it's in your apartment, then you can get all Christmassy about it.  You know, the whole delivery process.  If you're walking with a tree, I can understand if it's snowing out. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, and like you said, you're in the country or something, but you're walking up city blocks  with a tree.  I was also proud because I haggled a little bit.  Did you?  I saved $10.  Saved $10 and another $10 on the delivery.  Wow.  $20.  $20?  What are you celebrating Christmas for?  Yeah.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Somebody has a question for the That's How It's Done guy. 
[01:56:30]  Mike and Queen's Don't Go Anywhere.  More complaints.  Parents complain about Christmas songs at my kid's school.  I blame you parents, though, for just letting this happen.  I don't think our parents let this happen.  I think our parents were tougher.  They didn't just let this PC crap take hold.  Nobody was doing it because they had better things to do, also.  People were busy.  You know, we're working and raising kids.  We're so outraged that this is happening in our culture, but I do blame the people that  aren't speaking up and letting this happen. 
[01:57:00]  You know, I hope to have kids someday.  My kid isn't playing in a baseball league where everyone wins.  It ain't happening.  No.  Or if it does happen, they'll be dragging me to jail as I make a huge scene on the sidelines.  You'll be that guy.  Absolutely, yeah.  Phones are lit, so we'll go right back to the phones after this.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is time is here.  Happy death and cheer. 
[01:57:30]  La, la.  La, la.  La, la, la, la.  Charlie Brown sucked.  I knew that growing up, too.  This one was good.  The Christmas one.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Charlie Brown was a loser.  I was a big fan of The Great Pumpkin, but yeah.  We get it.  Charlie Brown's a loser.  But it always ends up at the end where, you know.  What?  Kind of a lovable character.  Yeah, but then the next episode, he's sad again.  Yeah.  Remember the one that was really good?  It was like, you're a bald douche, Charlie Brown. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  What eight-year-old has no hair?  He had no follicles to harvest.  That's right.  Yeah.  Or his hair plugs, right?  Not plugs.  Not acknowledging hair restoration until I have to get it done, and then, of course,  it'll be hair restoration.  This is the thing.  It was a quickie, but it was one of these who-gives-a-crap things that hit the news.  John McCain says he can't promise that he will support Sarah Palin for president.  Stop.  Sarah Palin will never be the president of this country. 
[01:58:30]  She failed miserably.  Reasonable.  But why do they have to report that?  Like, she has a real chance at the White House someday?  Yeah, she's got a shot at it.  No, she doesn't.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hi, Mikey.  What's happening?  What up, Mike?  Hey, listen.  They are so screwed up in my kid's school, right?  The Christmas cards can't have any religious, nothing like that on it.  It can only have, like, snowmen and snowflakes. 
[01:59:00]  The shwoogie born-again Christian family went and protested so loud that they couldn't sing.  They only could sing winter songs.  And then they kept this stinking kid out of school the day of the winter concert.  It just doesn't make any sense.  No.  And I start making a stink, and everybody's like, oh, no, you don't do that.  You're going to get in trouble.  Oh, don't say that.  Oh, no.  Parents can't get in trouble.  That's the beauty of it. 
[01:59:30]  You're not going to get in trouble.  You're going to get Uber parents to get you in trouble?  Maybe if you go to school with a gun or something, but you can yell and scream all you want.  You're not going to get in trouble for saying that in America.  Oh, I know that.  But they're pissed off because I'm not going to hold back and give it to them.  I start, and everybody, oh, no, no, calm down.  Don't do that.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  All right, Mikey.  All right.  Take care, boys.  We all might as well just give in and let it happen, right? 
[02:00:00]  I miss the days when they're ready to do the Pledge of Allegiance, and they had to make  a big stink about that one kid.  And the one kid, the teacher would look at the kid like, you know what you have to do,  and the kid would awkwardly get up and leave the classroom so the rest of us could do the  Pledge of Allegiance, and then like, all right, bring them back in.  You'd think it was the kid.  Bring them back in.  You'd honestly think it was the kid or the parents going, ah, I don't want you standing 
[02:00:30]  for that.  How much fun was that, though, to see the one kid?  Yeah.  We all had the one kid.  You had to be excused.  Yeah.  Obama.  Hey.  Obama doesn't.  He doesn't do the Pledge?  No, he doesn't put his hand over his heart.  He just kind of just mills about.  Yeah.  Doesn't stand at attention.  Doesn't look at the flag.  He will.  Yeah.  Once he's president.  Oh, yeah?  You think?  Yeah.  It's too embarrassing.  It's too disrespectful for the troops.  It would be too much.  Disrespectful during the campaign.  I agree.  Tell you the truth. 
[02:01:00]  But I think it'd just be too big of a headache.  I'm not Mr. Rah, rah, rah.  But I mean, the thing is that that's the tradition.  That's what you're supposed to do.  Show respect for your country and your flag.  If you don't believe in that, don't run for president.  And he, you know, looks elsewhere while everybody else is doing what they're supposed to do.  So, screw him.  Independent thinker, man.  Business as usual.  Mike in Queens.  What's up, guys?  I have a question for That's How It's Done, guys. 
[02:01:30]  Mike?  Thank you.  I was waiting for it.  You're slipping.  Yeah, go ahead, Mike.  All right.  I was at a mall, and I found a parking spot, and I'm waiting for the parking spot.  I'm waiting for the guy to pull out.  Look, this car that's about three or four parking spaces in front of me waiting for another spot up ahead.  Car pulls out.  I pull in.  This guy gets out of his car, comes up to me, and starts screaming at me that that was his spot.  He was four spots ahead of me.  Now, that's How It's Done, guys.  Are you allowed to claim a spot when you've passed this? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, if you get in there first.  If somebody's waiting with their blinker on in front of the spot, it's their spot.  If nobody's waiting and you're all converging at the same time, first in wins.  That's how it works.  I've passed people in the Best Buy parking lot.  I had a carload of people at the time and horrified them at the closeness I was to another vehicle to get past them to make the turn down an aisle where I saw a car pulling out. 
[02:02:30]  But this person, I think, was waiting for the car to pull out, but nowhere near the car.  And if I have room to get around you and your blinker's not on, my spot!  My blinker was on.  He was four cars ahead.  You can't back into a spot in a parking lot, Paul.  No way.  I won the argument.  All right.  You win.  There you go.  Hey, we got a fine Jewish gentleman checking in. 
[02:03:00]  He wants in on this discussion.  Billy in Jersey.  How are you, Billy?  What's up?  No, it's Ellie.  What's up?  Okay.  What do you got?  Of course it wasn't Billy.  Yeah.  Well, if I were sending my kids to public school, I wouldn't want them to be singing the Christmas  songs.  But here's the thing.  I won't send my kids to public school for that reason.  Because I don't want my kids to sing Christmas songs, and I don't want to make a big stink about  it.  Because you know what?  Who cares?  So I send them to Orthodox Jewish school, private school.  And I can't afford it. 
[02:03:30]  But that's what everyone does, so that they don't have to make a big stink like everyone  else does.  I like you.  I can't pronounce your name, but I like you.  That's what you should do.  Yes.  There you go.  Send your kids to the Jewish schools.  If you want such separatism, then be separate and put your kid in some kind of private school.  If you can't afford it, shut your mouth and deal with the customs of public schools.  Not even they can't afford it, because no one can afford Jewish private school nowadays.  It's so much money.  But you know what?  They have scholarships, and there's things like that, and there's tuition grants and things 
[02:04:00]  like that.  But you know what?  You suffer.  And you know what?  I don't know how I'm going to afford private school tuition for my kids for the rest of  their lives.  But you know what?  I'm going to struggle because of it.  Because it means something to me, and I don't want my kid to be in public school where  he's going to be ... Not that I want him to be so separate, not to know what a non-Jew  is.  You do.  You don't want your kid influenced by non-Jewish ideas.  That's the only reason you'd put him in a Jewish school.  Oops.  He had to hang up.  What happened?  I don't know.  I think he gives himself a few minutes every day on the phone, and he ran out of time. 
[02:04:30]  He's got to save that money.  He's on a tight budget.  Very tight budget.  He just hung up angrily.  He really did get mad.  I was calling him a separatist.  I don't think they like that word.  All right.  This just in.  Some primetime gossip from Sam Roberts.  What?  Yeah, it's breaking now.  Let's see what he's talking about.  We're back, and primetime gossip is coming at you with the O&A Scoop of the Century.  On a recent episode of the Opie and Anthony radio show, the guys made the announcement 
[02:05:00]  that one of Anthony's favorite eateries had burned to the ground.  20-foot flames I'm reading in the paper.  Total loss.  Completely devastated.  You won't be going back there no more.  No.  But while most got their information from the press, Anthony had other means of information  gathering.  I got the news via text, and this person, it was the first text I had gotten since probably  the end of the summer.  Really?  Yes. 
[02:05:30]  It was text from Jill.  That's right.  Anthony got the message from former fling, Jill Nicolini.  The two haven't spoken in some time, so they say.  But as soon as Jill's name came up, memories of Antholini came flooding back.  Because, like, Mia would show up a lot.  She would circle that on the bill.  On there.  Yes.  With a little note.  Love notes on a credit card bill?  How romantic.  Anthony's brain got so clattered with memories of love and lust that his train of thought  and professionalism had to take a back seat as he struggled to form sentences. 
[02:06:00]  If you recall, the, um, the, uh, well, what the hell was I going to say now?  In an effort to maintain journalistic integrity, we here at PTG reached out to Anthony for a  comment on the matter.  This is what he had to say about his breakup.  And getting the news from a text from her, it, uh, certainly was like, wow, that's ironic.  How sad.  Anthony's managed to hide it for months, but now he's made it clear. 
[02:06:30]  He needs Jill back in his life.  Will his dream of an Antholini reunion ever surface?  Stay tuned as primetime gossip follows what has become the love story of our generation.  Bravo to Sam.  Oh, my God, please, no.  No, please, no.  It's so much like those shows.  It's exactly like those shows.  Based on nothing.  Right.  Sam. 
[02:07:00]  The brilliance of that bit.  Smartass.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we got to leave, unfortunately.  Well, unless, of course, you fess up with a little bit of cash.  Yeah.  Huh?  We're going to, uh...  Unless you fess up with a little cash.  Serious XM.  Cash.  I don't get it.  What am I missing?  Just say serious, by the way.  Look at your ID.  I just got my serious ID.  Did you see any XM on there?  The name XM is better than the name serious.  I'm sorry.  Regardless.  Doesn't matter.  It's serious.  They're phasing that XM part out of the name. 
[02:07:30]  I got my ID, and it's just serious, serious, serious.  All over.  That's it.  I got mine, too.  It's a second-class citizen.  Yeah, that's true.  It's on flash paper.  No kidding.  It just...  It's gone.  Anyway, we're going to leave now.  Yep.  But here in New York at this fine radio station, they're about to start the rock and roll.  The rock and roll starts.  The rock and roll will be starting in just a little, little bit. 
[02:08:00]  So stay right there, okay?  Support the station, so we could continue doing this, I guess.  I don't know.  See you tomorrow.  Yeah.  It was the National Anthem, not the Pledge of Allegiance.  No, it wasn't.  That one dopey kid had to leave when we did the Pledge of Allegiance at Washington Drive School  out there in Centerport, Long Island.  We didn't do the National Anthem during class. 
[02:08:30]  Did you, Ed?  No.  It was always the Pledge of Allegiance.  What is it?  One nation under God.  That was the line.  We pledged Pleasant Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the  republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice  for all.  You just remind me of something.  You know, when you get a little older and you get a little money, you get to go on, like,  real vacations instead of going down to Florida again. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  And someone told me that, you know, sometimes when you're trying to get back in the country,  they ask you to do the Pledge of Allegiance, and if you don't know it, their suspicion is  raised.  Oh, really?  So I had an actual panic attack going on.  And I'm trying to remember the Pledge of Allegiance while I'm on that long line trying  to get back into the country.  Like they would do that.  I had an anxiety attack, though, over that one. 
[02:09:30]  What dumbbell told you that?  I don't remember.  This is years ago, but when Ant just did the whole Pledge of Allegiance, and of course he  did.  Mr. Do-Good.  Pledge of Allegiance.  I was reminded of that.  I used to not know what it meant, though.  That's the oddest thing when you're a kid and you're saying something, you're just so  brainwashed that you don't know what it means.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for  which it...  I used to think it was for which it stands. 
[02:10:00]  Like, for which it stands was one word.  Oh, meaning another country.  Which it stands.  And to the republic for which it stands.  One nation under God.  And then the indivisible thing was...  I was a typical kid.  I thought it was invisible.  Of course.  With liberty and justice for all.  And you just couldn't...  As a kid, could you possibly comprehend that whole...  You had no idea of pledging allegiance.  You don't know what allegiance means.  You couldn't digest that info.  So right away, I pledge allegiance to the flag. 
[02:10:30]  I don't know what allegiance means.  The United States of America.  And to the republic, what?  What is the republic?  For which it stands.  It's one word for which it stands.  One nation.  Okay.  Under God.  Under God.  God was this weird fucking white-haired guy that lived in heaven.  So you were under it anyway.  Indivisible.  God's invisible.  With liberty and justice for all.  Who knows?  That could have been candy.  We were joining a cult.  Could have been with Mike's and Ike's for all. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  We were joining a cult.  With pixie sticks and Snickers for all.  My thing is this.  Indivisible does not.  What's that mean exactly?  Cannot be divided?  Cannot be divided.  Where am I wrong where it says one nation, under God, indivisible?  Are they saying that the nation and God are indivisible?  No.  I believe it's one nation, comma, under God, comma, indivisible.  Which means, you know, it's one nation, indivisible.  Oh, the nation is.  And they threw in under God later on in the mix. 
[02:11:30]  I think that wasn't until, like, the 50s they threw in under God.  They snuck that by us.  Yeah, someone threw that one in there.  And putting God we trust on the money and everything like that.  But someone called me out.  I read that the founding fathers, a lot of the founding fathers didn't believe in God.  A lot of atheists back then.  A lot of atheists?  And then someone called me out and said, that's not true.  No, I think that is.  And then I couldn't really get the research done.  And I didn't feel like doing the research because I had to play Tiger Woods online again 
[02:12:00]  instead of doing the research.  So now I have to just, you know, listen to this dummy that said I was wrong.  A lot of people left that England place because of, you know, religious persecution.  The whole God thing?  So they came here to fuck things up.  I heard a lot of those early guys just weren't into the God thing.  A little busy fighting off engines.  Yeah, all right.  Trying to build something.  So you got sappy getting your Christmas tree together?  You feel the Christmas spirit a little bit?  No, it's not so much a sappy thing, but it's been so long since I've actually had a house 
[02:12:30]  that is Christmassy.  Like one year, I tried to go, I got a tree, you know, we got a tree.  Me and that's when I was with Melinda, got a tree.  But that was pretty much it.  So it was a tree in the living room.  With no decorations or anything?  No, there was some decorations on it.  It stayed there till July, I think.  Really?  Yeah, weren't too motivated.  And then, you know, before that, there wasn't anything. 
[02:13:00]  It was going over other people's houses, which is fine and everything, but it doesn't give  you that same thing.  Like I like, at night, I throw a log on the fire, I light the candles around the house  and all the lights are on, and I sit back and get shit-faced.  And isn't that what Christmas is all about?  Tom in Chicago.  Chicago!  He's got a weird theory here. 
[02:13:30]  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, just wanted to point out, first of all, happy holidays, merry Christmas.  Yeah, you too.  Christianity is really based on the biggest cuckold story of all time.  Hmm, yes.  If you think about it.  Yes.  Mary, Joseph.  Joseph sat around.  And he was an archangel as the bull.  The bull was, God was the bull.  God was the bull.  God was the bull.  And Joseph had to sit by.  That's right. 
[02:14:00]  Gee, that's horrible.  The biggest cuckold story.  You never hear that one.  And now, Hallmark presents the biggest cuckold story ever told.  Yeah.  On the family channel.  All right, man.  A cuckold.  Hugo Chavez laughing at the shoe incident.  They just had a little...  Ah.  Yeah.  They had actual video of him watching Bush, you know, doing his dodging.  Bobbing and weaving.  And Hugo Chavez was having a fine laugh over the whole thing. 
[02:14:30]  Hugo Chavez is a fucking scumbag.  Yes.  He's a fucking scumbag.  He really is.  I like how fucking Putin is going around.  What is Putin doing these days?  He's not even the fucking president over there anymore.  Mm-mm.  I think he wants...  I think something's a-brewin' over in Russia.  What do you mean?  I think those motherfuckers are slowly trying to get back to the good old days.  Let's hope so.  Let's hope so.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm rooting for them.  I would absolutely root for them to do that because I've had it with Europe. 
[02:15:00]  Had it?  And their attitude with the United States.  But it does seem like...  I think Putin wants to be president again.  And he's pulling all these moves like...  It was the first ship that went through the Panama Canal.  Mm-hmm.  First Russian warship to go through the Panama Canal since the 40s.  And then now a warship is...  A Russian warship is visiting Cuba.  Really?  Yeah!  Just going over there.  A little visit to Cuba.  And Putin's always in the news. 
[02:15:30]  Like, he's...  I think he's running things secretly, to tell you the truth.  And he's a real, like, fucking shifty guy.  They're rebuilding the anthill.  They want to rebuild.  Yeah, I think they really are...  Because of our influence, we kicked over that anthill a few years back.  And now they're like, all right, wait, we've got to get this anthill back together.  What they see is weakness right now.  Yeah.  They see weakness financially for us.  They see weakness politically.  Our world image stinks.  And it's a good time for the good old Soviet Union to try to pop up again. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know how much success they'd have reclaiming some of their old haunts.  Yeah.  Now that they're independent.  But who's going to fight them?  You know?  I think Europe is pretty sick of war.  We'd have to stay out of that one.  Fuck it.  Yep.  Fuck it.  I'd love to be able to sit out and watch Russia walk over Europe.  Or just...  It would start with, like, the Ukraine and, like, Romania and all these places. 
[02:16:30]  They would annex these places, like, hey, this was our shit.  Fuck you.  What are you going to do?  And then the U.S. would sit back and give some scoldings, but do nothing.  And then the rest of the world would go, why doesn't the U.S. help?  Oh, NATO, you're supposed to help us.  Everybody's...  Hey, we're busy.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, why don't you come in and have...  Shut up, you chicken shits.  Throw euros at them, you motherfucker.  Nice. 
[02:17:00]  Kicked off the line again.  Yeah, it really is stupid.  In other news, I'm just watching the headlines go by your head behind you there, Ed.  Yeah, I see them over there.  I am laughing so hard because Carolyn Kennedy wants to be the senator of New York now that Hillary's moving on.  Yep.  And I kind of agree with what Chuck Schumer is saying, but I also laugh at Chuck Schumer because the guy can't get a break ever.  Chuck Schumer's like, what the fuck?  What's her qualifications?  It doesn't even matter if you're in politics.  Her last name.  That's it.  That's all you need is the Kennedy name and they'll give you whatever the fuck you want in politics. 
[02:17:30]  That's all she's got.  So he's going to be looked over again.  Dude, it's all she has is the name.  If she wants to be the senator of New York, she will be the senator of New York.  She has stayed out of politics and out of the public eye.  She's been one of the Kennedys that really you don't know much about because she hasn't been out there.  And now it's like, all right, I'll take the gig based on your name. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  What does she have?  What qualifications does she have?  She's an ugly broad, too, man.  What happened to the cute little kid?  Oh, well, those Kennedys.  Those Kennedys got an odd look, all of them.  Yeah, they got a weird.  It's that inbreeding.  A weird tooth thing going on.  I don't know what it is.  What about the retarded Kennedy?  Where did that one end up?  Dead.  Remember that retarded one they gave a lobotomy to?  Well, they just, they put that one away for a while.  They put it to sleep?  Pretty much. 
[02:18:30]  They did.  Pretty much.  Chris in Delaware.  Yeah.  How are you, Chris?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, you're actually on the air and speak whenever you want.  Yeah, that would be your turn now, Chris.  We got the formalities out there.  My phone went a little crazy.  Actually, that guy who called you out about God, you're not entirely wrong.  What the Founding Fathers believed in was that God was just, like, something.  They didn't believe it was the big guy with the long white hair in the sky that the Christians believe in, 
[02:19:00]  but they believed that it was just, like, in nature and just there.  So you're not entirely wrong.  You're saying they were pagans?  Yeah, basically.  I mean, it was founded by pagans.  I mean, the Republic, at least.  Well, initially, when the pilgrims came here, they were very religious people.  Absolutely.  And Quakers.  Once capitalism came in, that all changed.  I mean, there was, like, when they originally came over here as a colony to get away from the English, 
[02:19:30]  like, from Cromwell and all those English bastards, and then they realized they had no theater,  they had no bars, nothing, but then they realized they could make money,  and then they started going after all that stuff.  Yeah.  All right, though.  You're not absolutely wrong, Opie.  So love you guys.  Later.  All right, thanks.  Can I just touch on the story that I just read on Drudge?  Touch it.  A Delaware man charged in bizarre castration plot. 
[02:20:00]  Yes, Delaware man.  He flies around.  I am Delaware man.  Yes, I am the smallest of all the superheroes.  Big D on his chest.  Next to Rhode Island man.  Yes, next to Rhode Island.  He picks out Rhode Island man.  He calls him a faggot.  And then Texas man walks in and fucks both their mouths.  Florida man's embarrassed because he looks like a cock.  This California man, the top half, always wants Florida man in the tiny.  Guy in Delaware.  A Delaware man has been arrested after being accused of arranging a bizarre plot 
[02:20:30]  that involved castrating his ex-son-in-law.  Ex-son-in-law.  Wilbur Eichmann.  Oh, wow.  So his daughter's husband.  Ex.  Husband.  Ex.  Right.  He's been charged with one count of criminal solicitation.  He paid this guy cash to beat up his ex-son-law.  So he paid this guy $1,200 to beat up the victim.  So cheap to get people to do stuff.  It really is.  Then he offered a bonus if this guy cut off the victim's genitals.  I could cut off his genitals sort of like a bonus. 
[02:21:00]  Thanks, Brooks, you dummy.  Go hang yourself.  He offered or suggested that the guy use a high-power rifle and said,  if you castrate him, there's a bonus for you, an additional three grand.  And he said he wanted his ex-son-in-law's genitals brought to him.  So the guy got attacked.  Good eating.  Oh, dude.  What did he do to your daughter?  Yeah, right?  What happened there?  He beat him up in the stairwell of an apartment building.  He struck him in the face and demanded money.  But then the guy fled the scene when the victim started to yell for help. 
[02:21:30]  So the next day, the victim got a call from the guy who said,  Hey, I'm the guy that beat you up.  And I have some information about the person who hired me.  And he played the, you know, he charged 500 bucks.  And so they met in a very public place.  And so he played a cell phone conversation.  And the guy said, that's my ex-father-in-law.  Wow.  And the guy, Eichmann, was arrested on Saturday and charged with one count of criminal solicitation.  And he was released after, like, 500 bucks.  How are you fucking released on $500 bail when you're hiring someone to cut the cock off another person? 
[02:22:00]  Wow, that's crazy.  Oh, that's him.  That's him right there.  Looks like just some old neighbor.  Yeah.  Yes.  How?  $500?  Dude, how is that just criminal solicitation?  Don't we have a clause in there where it says, if you want someone's penis brought to you, that's a really bad thing?  Yeah, that bail should be very high.  It should be criminal solicitation for a punch in the face.  For the penis being cut off, it should be barbaric shit, $200,000 or more. 
[02:22:30]  As a rule of thumb, it should always be, the bail should always be more than you were originally charging for the testicles.  Because it was $3,000 for the balls and only 500 bail?  I'd love to know, though, like you said, what this son-in-law did.  He must...  Did he just fucking pull up and start fucking right in front of the father?  Or did he force...  Hey, look at what I'm doing to your daughter.  Did he fucking rape her, the daughter?  Or did he abuse the daughter?  Or did he just have an affair on the daughter? 
[02:23:00]  It's got to be something sexual.  Maybe an affair.  Affair.  Maybe he told her in the ass.  Maybe he put it in a shitter.  Maybe he didn't.  Wiped it on the curtains.  They don't have more info on this?  No, I think it's just breaking now.  I mean...  We'll get more info on this.  Watch it be something stupid.  Like they divorced and they couldn't agree on who got that coffee table and the fun photo book about New York City.  And so he said, bring me his cock.  Get me his dick.  This guy's fucking...  Mr. Eichmann doesn't play games.  No.  I'm just watching the TVs because there's a lot of weird stuff. 
[02:23:30]  Colonoscopies detect cancer only on left side of colon.  What?  This is just breaking today.  Can they just turn you on your stomach and just shoot it again?  What the fuck is that about?  You could check the right side three times.  Right.  Only on the left side.  How does that...  Cancer only on the left side of the colon.  First of all, your fucking intestines are wrapped around like knots.  What's the left side?  It's the sigmoid colon and that's why it's checking the smaller intestines. 
[02:24:00]  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy almost had me.  Yeah.  You cracked.  For like a second.  Hey, I don't know what that's about.  Hey, Danny Aiello was singing on fucking...  On PIX.  You want to hear him?  I'm dying.  We have it?  Yeah, of course we have it.  By the way, they got...  What is some Dago fucking crap?  Maybe Sirius can help us because I want...  It's relevant.  Alan Alda is on PIX tomorrow and these fucking publicists, can they stop with just going  to the local...  We have more people listening than PIX has watching. 
[02:24:30]  They'll never get Alan Alda on our show.  They might.  Sirius might.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  They'll fucking know.  That's a tough order.  I don't think it's going to work, Jimmy.  Oh, blot-blot-blot.  What?  Oh, it is going to work.  Danny Aiello singing.  Just moments ago on TV.  As a kid, he sang on the street corners of the Bronx.  He's since gone on to become an Oscar-nominated actor starring in over 70 movies, but with  his new album, Live from Atlantic City, Danny Aiello has returned to his love of music,  and here he is performing...  ...wannabe Sinatra shit.  ...some of these days. 
[02:25:00]  So far, it stinks.  Raise your hand when you officially get the douche chills.  I did when he went, huh!  Yeah.  Yeah.  That wasn't a good start.  No.  Some of these days.  My hand's not up yet.  Come on, Jim.  I want to enjoy this.  He's actually got a good voice.  You're gonna miss me, baby.  Some of these days. 
[02:25:30]  You're gonna feel so lonely.  You're gonna miss my hug again.  You're gonna miss my kiss.  This is real relevant music.  Really bringing that.  You may even miss me, baby.  When you're long gone away.  This is going crazy.  Well, I hope you feel so lonely.  You want me only.  He's not as awful as a party, baby. 
[02:26:00]  No, baby.  It's...  It's okay.  It's like any old fucking Italian can do this.  Yeah.  Believe me.  Any old Italian can fucking get a big band behind him and sing like that.  It's like black people and hip-hop.  No, they can't all do it.  It just comes naturally.  No, it's not correct.  There's a lot of band rappers.  If you have your chocolate rain, it's fucking great.  Just one guy.  Chocolate Reed. 
[02:26:30]  Chocolate Reed.  Yeah, but he did one song.  I know.  One hit wonder.  Jay-Z put a bunch of them out.  You know who I love now?  I never listened to this song before.  Even though it's 1995.  Fucking California Love by Tupac and Dr. Dre.  California.  That fucking Dr. Dre is fantagious.  That is a great song, actually.  You can't not like that tune.  I went to him for a foot problem once, though, and he couldn't help me.  Abby.  No, no.  You're just mixing him up with a real doctor. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, okay.  Abby.  This is...  Yeah.  Dr. Dre is fucking tremendous.  All right, we got an asshole doctor on the phone.  Get rid of Tupac.  Hi, Steve.  Doctor.  Dr. Chucid.  Is that how you say your name there, sir?  Yes, hi.  How are you?  This is Dr. Chucid.  I'm a gastronologist.  I was just listening to your show about colonoscopies.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  It's untrue what they're saying.  I've done about 35,000 cases.  Man, you really love assholes.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hence his enjoyment of this show.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Most colon cancers are actually located in the sigmoid colon, about 60 to 70 percent.  Told you.  But colonoscopy detects 95 to 97 percent of lesions, and it is the gold standard in colon cancer detection.  Always was, always will be.  Hmm.  So you're saying that this left side thing has no credence or clearwater revival. 
[02:28:00]  I'm going to scream today.  Ha-boo.  Ha-boo.  Ha-boo.  We've released all our bombs.  We're flying back to base.  That was a good one.  Oh, no, it wasn't.  You're right.  All right.  It was a good one, all right.  Look at the crater left in the ground.  Ha-ha-ha.  All right, Dr. Chushid.  Thank you.  All right.  Ha-ha-ha.  Drop all the remaining jokes on my paws. 
[02:28:30]  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  It's a lovely fucking show.  Ha-ha-ha.  All right.  I was going to ask you your favorite Christmas song today.  My favorite Christmas song?  Do you have one?  Do you crank it up a little bit?  It's got to be that Sleeves song.  Oh, good.  All right.  You want me to play this?  No, I hate it.  Oh, I thought you were being serious.  La-la-la.  In the la-la-la.  It's snowing in the la-la-la.  It sure is.  I'm not.  What's your favorite Christmas song? 
[02:29:00]  Do you go old school?  Do you do a little Burl Ives or Bing Crosby?  I like a rockin' around.  The Christmas tree have...  No, I hate that song.  It sucks.  I don't like any old-timey Christmas songs.  What, do you like newer ones?  No.  Oh, there's your favorite right here?  Terrible.  Some fucking pie?  Yeah.  Jeez, what a potty mouth this bitch was.  I think the best Christmas song is Stevie Wonder's version of Little Drummer Boy. 
[02:29:30]  For real?  Yes.  Holly Jolly Christmas.  Have a hover.  Check.  The halls with the bounds.  What's your favorite?  Jimmy, is that your favorite?  Yeah, it's great.  I want to hear that one.  I don't know.  That's too updated.  Well, yeah, but he does a good job.  Elvis.  Elvis.  You don't have a favorite Christmas song.  No, I don't.  Hey, that one Bing Crosby song is good. 
[02:30:00]  Give me another drink so I can punch you in the face.  Merry Christmas.  Yeah, Merry Christmas, bitch.  Clean it up.  Bing.  Read up on Bing, man.  Get his kids rocks for Christmas and throw them at him.  You got to read up on Bing Crosby.  He did all those Christmas specials when people were growing up.  Bing was a douche.  And when those cameras went off, it was a whole different story.  Bing liked to tip back a few and smack people around.  Old brick liver. 
[02:30:30]  He had that great song, Ham Through the Window.  How about the Bing Crosby little drummer boy that he did with David Bowie?  That's pretty good, though.  Oh, it sucks so fucking bad.  Why don't you like it?  They used to play that one, and I remember seeing it on TV.  And David Bowie was in his total glam, glitter, rock phase.  And here's old fucking Bing with his pipe.  And they looked ridiculous together. 
[02:31:00]  The best part is, oh, come on in.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, well, look who's come.  It's Bowie.  David Bowie is coming in.  Let's sing a song.  He's got his pipe, and David Bowie's hair is spiked.  It looks like if that was his son, he'd fucking disown him and kill him.  Yeah, he would have punched him.  Well, look, we've got a homosexuals coming in to sing Little Drummer Boy. 
[02:31:30]  Where's the Stevie Wonder version?  You want to hear Stevie Wonder?  Yeah, it's good.  Oh, they don't have it, Jimmy.  Why would they?  I mean, I have Stevie Wonder's version of Little Drummer Boy.  What do we fucking...  They have 18 Christmas channels on this service.  Sheesh.  They should have the Stevie Wonder song for Jimmy.  I don't even remember which one you're talking about.  Little Drummer Boy?  Yeah.  Well, we know the song.  I know that song, but I don't know.  They made David Bowie go conservative.  He has a little blazer on.  He doesn't have his hair up.  No, it's not spiky.  I remember it being spiky.  He's got kind of the mullety thing going on a little bit. 
[02:32:00]  Well, why don't we sing a little song here?  Come on.  Why don't you come in?  Have a drink.  Right.  You have one of my drinks, and let me have some of your cocaine.  A newborn came to see the rum-pa-pum-pum.  Oh.  Hey.  Nice to meet you.  Well, when I smack the kids around, I like listening to your music.  Rum-pa-pum-pum.  That's the sound the wife makes when she's going down the steps. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, Bing was a naughty boy.  Oh, boy.  What was the dumb little banter they had before the song?  Yeah, that's what we want.  You have that?  We want some stupid banter.  He said, are you really a drunk?  And he said, no, are you really a faggot?  And then the music started.  He vomited gum in Bing's face.  Bing thought it was whiskey, so he drank it.  They rolled around sucking each other's dicks, humming rum-pa-pum-pum-pum. 
[02:33:00]  That was the director's cut.  He was holding David Bowie's balls like that pipe as he sucked on the head of his cock.  Yeah.  E-Rock just panked and said, but it's two minutes.  Well, what else are we going to do?  Let's play the dumb banter these two have.  Play the banter because it's...  You better.  It's been a long time since I've been the new anything.  What's that into Hudson?  I guess he's changing.  Yeah, he does that a lot, doesn't he?  You're not getting the hello.  Yeah, get back to the hello.  He's got to get right when he opens the fucking door. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, he looks through that little hole in the fucking rest area bathroom, and he goes, hello, I know you.  And they have to both cover for the fact that they're fucking mule juice drinking Moe's.  So they pretend they want to sing rum-pa-pum-pum through that fucking filthy hole in the stall wall.  XM Channel 120 has all the Bing Crosby Christmas specials.  Great.  For the people that care out there.  All right, let's go, E-Rock, from the beginning.  Here we go.  Good.  I don't know.  I wonder if he's at the door. 
[02:34:00]  Let me just punch him.  You the new banter?  Well, it's been a long time since I've been the new anything.  What's happened to Hudson?  I guess he's changing.  Yeah, he does that a lot, doesn't he?  Oh, I'm David Bowie.  I live down the road.  Oh.  Sir Percival lets me use his piano when he's not around.  He's not around, is he?  I can honestly say I haven't seen him, but come on in.  Oh, the actor's terrific.  Why is he in his house?  Are you related to something?  Yeah, let's pause this.  Well, definitely, yeah.  What the hell's going on?  I don't know what happened. 
[02:34:30]  David Bowie lives down the street from Bing Crosby, but comes over to his house when  Bing's not around.  To use the piano.  And who's Hudson?  And, and, and.  Did he say, where's Hudson?  Yeah, where's the servant?  The servant, okay.  But he uses the piano, but it's Bing's house?  Yes.  What the fuck is going on?  Well, what happens here is then Bing hauls out his cock and says, let's see how you  are on the organ.  This doesn't make sense.  Is David Bowie just walking into, yeah.  And then he doesn't even know who he is. 
[02:35:00]  What the fuck?  All right, go.  He's like, I'm David Bowie.  I live down the road.  You would think they would have met by now.  I don't care.  I'm Bing Crosby and I've drunk drove down it.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  That's what David's talking about.  Well, you take the Hershey Highway.  Hi, I'm David Bowie.  Did you ever hear Jumpin' Jack Flash?  I suck that guy's cock.  All right, let's continue.  Yes. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, you're not the poor relation from America, huh?  Gee, news show travels fast, doesn't it?  I'm Bing.  Oh, I'm pleased to meet you.  You're the one that sings, right?  Well, right.  You're the one that sings.  Hold on.  Okay, he's a relative from America and he's visiting.  Is that what you're getting?  That's exactly what I just got.  But he lives down the street.  Yep, no, but David Bowie lives down the street.  See, they're in England right now.  And Bing.  So Bing's the relative from America who's now visiting. 
[02:36:00]  And he goes, oh, you're the one who sings.  David Bowie has no idea who Bing Crosby is.  You're the one that sings.  So what happens is Bing Crosby is related to some fucking Peter Pumper.  Yeah, English faggot.  David Bowie goes over to fuck the guy's mouth, ears, and ass a lot.  And then he sees this fucking old man with perfect hair and a fucking child's tooth in  his knuckle.  And he says...  And he goes, oh, shit, I got to change my story. 
[02:36:30]  He goes, I need cover.  He goes, I come over here to play the piano.  Right.  And Bing says, we don't have a piano, you British fruit.  So why don't you come on in?  Why don't you go suck Mick Jagger's cock?  Yeah, why don't you come on in and toot on this for a little while?  And then he smears a carrot cake on his bag to entice Bowie.  And David Bowie checks the right side of his colon.  Who's blackberry's going off?  I keep checking mine.  Now at least I know what's going on.  All right, let's...  Yeah, I'll clarify.  Let's continue with this. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, you're not the poor relation from America, right?  Gee, the news sure travels fast, doesn't it?  I'm Bing.  Oh, I'm pleased to meet you.  You're the one that sings, right?  Well, right or wrong, I sing either way.  Oh, well, I sing too.  Oh, good.  What kind of singing?  Well, mostly the contemporary stuff.  Do you like modern music?  Oh, I think it's marvelous.  Some of it really fine.  Tell me, you ever listen to any of the older fellas?  Oh, yeah, sure.  I like John Lennon. 
[02:37:30]  And the other one with Harry Nilsson.  Oh, you go back that far, huh?  Oh, yeah, I'm not as young as I look.  None of us is these days.  In fact, I've got a six-year-old son, and he really gets excited around the Christmas  holiday things.  I think you went for any of the traditional things in the Bowie household, Christmas town.  Oh, yeah, most of them, really, yeah.  Excuse me, can we pause this for a second?  Yeah, there's a lot of problems here.  Holy shit.  He just said the Bowie household.  Did he say, hi, I'm David Bowie, or I'm David?  David Bowie. 
[02:38:00]  The Bowie household.  Did he say, I'm David Bowie, or I'm just David?  I'm David Bowie.  Okay, he did.  He's David Bowie.  The Bowie household.  Bowie is what everyone's doing watching this.  Ah, Bowie.  And Bing does boozy.  And he goes, hey, Bing, is it hard to get presents under the tree when the tree is laying  on its side?  Because you've drunkenly grabbed your wife by the clit and thrown her into it.  Oh, shit. 
[02:38:30]  David, yeah, you ever sidekick your children when they're running up for a hug?  It just feels right.  Wow.  What year was this made that John Lennon's one of, like, the older guys?  No, see, that was the joke that Bowie's known for.  I understand, but it's like...  See, I go way back, like, you know, four years, five years.  Because David Bowie was, like, what, completely new at this point?  Nah, it's probably... 
[02:39:00]  Let's do a little guess here.  I'm going to go with 1972.  No.  No, it was really tasteless.  It was 1980.  Right after Lennon got shot straight through a Lennon jab in there.  Oh, shit.  Before Lennon.  All right, I'm going to go 19...  I'm going to guess 76, but that's just me.  No, no.  It's pushing 80.  No.  Bing Crosby died in 1978.  Did he really?  No.  It's like, fuck, you got me.  What year?  All right, I'll say 74.  74?  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  I guess...  I'm pushing 80.  I'm even...  They can't do it.  When was Lennon shot?  1980.  This is so fucking old.  You know what?  I'm going to go 82.  Wow, you're crazy.  Enough time went by with the Lennon thing.  Dude, you're crazy.  I guess...  This is so 70s.  I said 76, Ant said 74.  Oh, apparently it's up to 97 at this point.  Can I change my guess?  Yes.  79. 
[02:40:00]  77.  I'm telling you, I'm thinking this pushes 80.  It's 77.  77?  Yeah, I just saw it up on the album.  Where?  Right there.  Fucker?  Who wins?  Right down there.  Who wins?  I do.  I said 76.  Yeah, we're doing Price is Right rules.  I won.  No, you lose.  We all know I won.  No, you lose.  No, I won over.  I hope you won over.  No, I didn't.  Let's get back to these two douchebags.  I can't take this audio. 
[02:40:30]  It's killing me.  I've got a six-year-old son, and he really gets excited around Christmas time.  You ever punch him in the mouth?  You've went through any of the traditional things in the boy household Christmas time?  Oh, yeah, most of them, really.  Presents, tree, decorations.  Wow.  Pagents sliding down the chimney.  All the basics.  I was just seeing if you're paying attention.  Actually, our family do most of the things that other families do.  We sing the same songs, do you?  I even have a go at White Christmas.  You do.  And this one. 
[02:41:00]  This is my son's favorite.  Do you know this one?  Oh, I do indeed.  It's a lovely thing.  Oh, God.  There we go.  We don't have to hear the song, right?  Yes, we do.  All right, there's a little controversy.  Controversy?  What?  Crosby died in 1977.  He died in October of 1977. 
[02:41:30]  Well, maybe he shot himself after he saw the final cut.  No way.  So now we have to...  All right, the album came out in 77, but if it's a Christmas album, that would come out  posthumously, posthumously, posthumously, I want to know when they actually did this.  Now you've got to start thinking 1976, which would mean Jimmy is the big winner.  This was recorded on September 11th, 1977, and it says Crosby would die just over a month 
[02:42:00]  after recording this special.  Wow!  Well, let me tell you, I'm going to be dropping dead soon.  Holy shit, a month after we just saw that?  Now it's creepy to watch.  Dead.  I was guessing he died in 78.  I was just kidding.  I was off by a year.  Well, you gave him an extra year.  Look at you.  Generous.  To a fault.  What can I say?  You rule.  What did he die of?  AIDS from shaking David Bowie's hand. 
[02:42:30]  David Bowie.  Let's go with the guess.  I will say...  Alcoholics.  You know something?  It wasn't the heart.  He didn't look...  It might be the heart because he didn't look like the big casino.  Did he die on a golf course?  I heard it was a tightrope accident.  On a golf course?  Whose fucking BlackBerry is that?  I don't own a BlackBerry.  Is it out there?  Oh, that.  It's out there.  Who is it?  Is that Poe?  Why is Poe miked? 
[02:43:00]  First of all, why is Poe miked?  And second of all...  That miked.  Okay.  Can someone tell Poe to...  How fucking loud is that?  Put it on vibrate, you dummy.  And a...  A dugalugalug.  A dugalugalug.  A dugalugalug.  I'll say brain hemorrhage.  Oh, that's a good one.  I'm going brain hemorrhage.  Do you know, though?  No, I don't.  Swear.  I'm going to go...  Liver failure. 
[02:43:30]  I'm going to go with a weird one.  And he was...  Sorry.  He was raped and eaten by a Komodo dragon.  If Jimmy wins this...  Who has the answer?  Travis has the answer.  All right, here we go.  I have stroke.  Close, Jim. 
[02:44:00]  Heart failure.  Was it on a golf course?  No, that was Caddyshack.  Yeah.  He died in Spain.  So, I don't know.  What was he doing?  I don't know.  Let me find out.  Let me find out.  How are you going to find out what he was doing in Spain?  Wikipedia.  Oh.  It's a heart attack.  I'm going to go with the golf course thing.  The old Tigger.  The old Tigger went out.  What do you think? 
[02:44:30]  There was a blood clot from his knuckles.  Went into his heart.  Don't bash that fucking wife of his.  And there is the tombstone.  Oh, boy.  So, we've got to be around.  What do we got?  Death news.  What do we got?  Oh, that's his tombstone.  That's his tombstone.  Wonderful.  God, he was only 73.  Seven to seven.  You're right.  Golf course?  Well.  He went there to play golf. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  It says he went to, headed for Spain to play golf and die.  And die, yeah.  Was he on the golf course when he died?  He's golfing.  The master's last putt, Bing bowed to applause and said it was a great game.  He was about 20 yards from the clubhouse when he collapsed from a massive heart attack.  Wow.  Wow.  Great game.  Wow.  His son said that to, can you put that back, Travis?  His son said that to endure the pain of the beatings, he would dream up ways to kill his father.  The kid's brother, Lindsey, supported the charges in the book. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  Uh, wow.  Jesus.  I should read that book.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a good read.  I know we were all looking for the Spain joke and Tim H. from Columbus.  He was running with the bulls in Spain and was gored in the ass.  That's right.  Which reminded him of his bully experience.  I liked it, yeah.  I liked it, yeah.  In my bum, bum, bum, bum.  But, Jimmy, listen to the headphones.  Oh, but, Jimmy.  Okay.  Just listen for a second. 
[02:46:00]  Stevie Wonder.  Yeah, I reckon.  For you, Jimmy, you're going to play this.  Go to the back.  This sucks.  Come, they told me, pa-ra-pum-bum-bum.  Oh.  A newborn king to see, pa-ra-pum-bum-bum.  This is Alex, Stevie.  That's him.  Yeah?  That's him?  Yes.  Our finest gifts we bring, pa-ra-pum-bum-bum.  I don't know.  I think it is, actually.  Wait, yes.  To lay before the king, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, it's him.  All right, we'll play the rest of it.  So to honor him, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum.  When we come.  Come.  Come.  I have no eyes to see, pa-ra-pum-bum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum.  Stop throwing eggs at me, pa-ra-pum-bum-bum. 
[02:47:00]  I'm a poor boy, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum.  This is the shit.  I have no gift to bring, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum.  I can stare at the sun, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum.  I'm singing into a hairbrush.  I've walked into the drum set and fallen over it, pa-ra-pum-bum-bum. 
[02:47:30]  That's the sound it made.  Damn, I'm dumb.  All right, let's get rid of this.  That goes up another notch, doesn't it?  Oh, wait.  Oh, you missed the best part.  He changes the lyrics.  Here it goes up.  Every night it pa-ra-pum-bum, pa-ra-pum-bum. 
[02:48:00]  The ox and lamb kept time for-pum-bum.  I lied, by the way.  It hasn't changed.  There's only ox and lamb keep time.  That's an asshole.  By the way, as far as-  Man must suck if the ox and lamb are keeping time.  I know.  He can't see, so he has to say to the ox,  Hey, what time is it?  The ox and I don't know.  Stop eating my tail and ask the lamb.  Boo.  I should have just cut my losses and pissed.  As far as favorite Christmas song, you fell real short.  This thing stinks. 
[02:48:30]  There's so many better songs than this thing.  Name me 16.  16?  No, that's better.  The Stevie Wonder one was great.  It's a great version.  It's my favorite.  Not his favorite Christmas song.  No one else would go with that.  I wouldn't care.  Fuck all of them.  What am I going to listen to?  I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas.  That was the best version of that song.  That's my favorite song.  No, there's some of the ones in the 80s.  What came out in the 80s?  The 80s?  It was a little Billy Squire or something.  Billy Squire had his and Bruce and...  Bruce had one? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, I think so, right?  Mm-hmm.  Bad gloves have got me to tear.  Bad gloves have got me to tear.  Bad gloves have got me to tear.  Bad gloves have got me to tear.  You know, Clarence comes out dressed like Santa, and he can't stop laughing because it's preposterous  that a...  Where's my beep?  I don't know.  I think you get it.  Are you... 
[02:49:30]  I can tell you mine.  Oh, you have a favorite Christmas song?  No, I don't actually.  Ah, yes, you do.  Well, we'll take a break.  Let's hear it first.  No, we'll take a break.  What is it?  We'll take a break.  Love to hear it.  We'll take a break.  Come on, what is it?  What is it?  No, we'll just take a break.  No, no break necessary.  How about we do that?  It's satellite.  Because I've got to take a leak, and I know you're going to kill me for 20 minutes.  Why?  It's Christmas time. 
[02:50:00]  Because they sing about ghost stories and stuff.  That's your tea.  Ghost stories.  That's the teas.  All right.  And don't cheat with pal talk.  I won't even...  Will Anthony come up with a song?  We'll find out after the break.  And cheat with ghost stories.  There's ghost stories in there.  Ooh, some kind of spirit?  Or they reference ghost stories.  Mm-hmm.  That's your hint.  All right.  It's my favorite Christmas song, though.  Ooh, as long as it's Christmas.  Mm-hmm.  It's old school.

[02:56:30]  Oh, I thought it was the same.  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.  I'm dreaming of a yellow hiney.  No, because Anthony said that his favorite Christmas song would probably come from the 80s,  something that was made in the 80s.  Well, I just said there were a lot of them in the 80s.  I never said favorites.  There were a lot of shit made in the 80s.  Okay, well, Travis found a list of Christmas songs that came out in the 80s. 
[02:57:00]  Ooh.  And this is one that obviously fell horribly short.  Yes.  How about the really big band that tries to come up with the next Christmas classic and  just fails miserably?  Like Gary Glitter did, another rock and roll Christmas.  He thought it was going to be a biggie.  Here's some of the songs from the 80s that came out.  But 12 Days of Christmas, the Bob and Doug McKenzie version.  Ugh.  Yes.  Baby, Please Come Home by U2. 
[02:57:30]  They did their Christmas song in the 80s.  How was it?  It was all right.  It was all right.  Back Door Santa by Bon Jovi.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  I think that one was a bust.  You sure you didn't mix that up with the Gary Glitter one?  Huh?  Yeah.  Mm-mm.  What else?  Beer for Breakfast, The Replacements, whatever.  Trying to come up with the ones people remember. 
[02:58:00]  There's a lot of crap on here, Ant.  Christmas and Hollis, Run DMC.  That's right.  They did their birthday.  Yeah.  Billy Squire, Christmas is a time to say I love you.  That was a big one.  That was a biggie, right?  Yeah.  Pesh Mode had a Christmas song in the 80s?  Christmas Island?  With MTV, everybody decided if they put out a Christmas song, they would get video time.  Right.  That goes on and on.  Spinal Tap, Christmas with the Devil?  Yeah.  These things never really got airplay. 
[02:58:30]  Just on MTV.  Did that one get it?  Yeah.  I remember that.  You remember Spinal Tap's Christmas song on MTV?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that one.  All the VJs, remember?  They put little Santa hats on.  Little Martha Quinn would put her little Santa hat on.  Everyone thought she was adorable.  Yeah.  She sucked.  Van Halen's new Christmas song.  Oh, Van Halen has a new Christmas song, Jimmy?  How does it go?  Christmas Rock, it's called. 
[02:59:00]  No, it isn't.  It is called Christmas Rock.  Really?  How's it going?  I don't really know.  I've only thought of it a little bit.  Christmas, Christmas Rock.  It's a little like Jamie's Crying.  Well, they used to do that, rework some of their classics.  Yeah, they stink.  To fit the Christmas motif.  Hey, we're back.  The Band-Aids, do they know it's Christmas, came out on the 80s.  Take it.  Jimmy will write a little more. 
[02:59:30]  I mean...  I hate that one.  Let's see.  Better than ever.  We're back.  Together forever.  You don't like that song?  It's despicable.  And it's catchy.  Long, long, long.  Long, long, long, long, long time.  The more things change, the more they stay the same. 
[03:00:00]  That's a good smile at Wolfgang, because he's new.  Of course it is, because he's new, but there's still Van Halen.  Oh, it's so horrific.  The whole scenario is embarrassing.  Did that song ever run through your head?  Yeah, it's a lot.  I find myself singing it around the house.  I go, we're back.  I'm so happy.  Oh, I hope I'll ruin your life with that song.  Oh, it's terrible.  It jams itself in there. 
[03:00:30]  Won't leave.  Where were we?  Do they know it's Christmas time at all?  No, they don't.  What is this?  This isn't...  What?  The Live Aid one?  This is...  What is this?  This isn't...  You too?  That's not do you know it's Christmas time at home or whatever. 
[03:01:00]  At all.  At all?  They don't know, because they're in Africa starving.  It's real hot over there.  It's not snowing.  No Santa Claus.  Right.  They'd put him in a big fucking pot.  Right.  And put fire under it.  If Santa was smart, he'd blow out every match that they try to light, because that's what Bugs Bunny does.  Never gets cooked in a pot, Bugs.  Smart.  Smart rap.  All right.  We don't need to hear this now, you rock.  It's Christmas time. 
[03:01:30]  And...  What are you getting for Christmas?  More flies around your head.  What's this?  Who's singing this?  This is the Live Aid thing.  Oh.  Where they all come together to sing about Africa.  It's the all-star lineup.  Yeah.  They all had a line or two in the song.  All I want for Christmas is ten extra pounds.  Who is this right here? 
[03:02:00]  Name the artist.  One of the Wham dudes, probably.  Yeah.  That's the only thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think you're right.  I think that's the guy that Oaks gets caught jerking off.  George Michael.  George Michael.  Maybe.  Or maybe Simon LeBond.  Maybe that was Duran Duran.  Yeah.  Sound a little like Duran Duran.  With that little crack in his voice. 
[03:02:30]  Gotta get to the chorus.  Of course.  All the fucking stuffed shirts.  That's what I'd always say.  Thank God it's them instead of me.  And there won't be snow in Africa.  There won't be snow in Africa ever.  Dummy.  They're lucky they have buses. 
[03:03:00]  Do they?  I don't know.  I don't even know.  Well, nothing ever grows.  Nothing ever grows?  Oh.  Who's that faggot?  Do they know it's Christmas time at home?  Oh, Bananarama.  Bill Collins.  Do you raise a plan for everyone?  Give through that underneath that burning sun.  Do they know it's Christmas time at home? 
[03:03:30]  They don't, so don't remind them with a song.  They wouldn't even miss Christmas if it wasn't for this fucking song.  Don't show them what they're missing.  Wait, you mean there's Christmas?  Right.  What the fuck is that about?  You mean there's this cool thing called Christmas?  You got presents?  They still like that blonde chick in Bananarama.  Weren't they all blonde?  No.  I don't think so.  I like the cute one.  Jesus, where are these people now? 
[03:04:00]  I know.  Half these people are nobodies now.  They're just on job sites.  I would love to know the official lineup of this song.  A lot of nobodies in there.  Yeah.  They were famous for maybe a year or two.  Who's that?  Kajagoogoo.  Oh, is that Kajagoogoo?  Nah, I don't even know.  That's George Michael.  Oh, Twisted Sister has a Christmas song?  Oof.  Hold on.  That's got to be great.  We got that two years ago.  We've never had the opportunity to play it, so you guys. 
[03:04:30]  There we go.  There we go.  Not playing Twisted Sister's Christmas song ever.  It's a whole album.  It's a whole album.  It's about cookies.  It's called We're Not Gonna Bake Them.  It's not just one song.  They have a whole album of Christmas songs?  Yep.  Give it up.  It's over.  You had a good run.  What are you doing?  It's new?  Two years old.  Oh, come on.  I got it here.  Didn't Van Halen have another song for Christmas?  It was called Don't Give Grandma the Christmas Brownies. 
[03:05:00]  You know, because there was stuff baked into them.  I hate whenever you bring up Van Halen.  Do they know it's Christmas time at all?  For Christmas, Winnie Mandela puts that fucking tire with gasoline in it around someone's neck, 
[03:05:30]  puts them on top of a tree and lights it.  No, but she paints the tire green like a wreath.  Fucking brutal, that one.  Soweto necktie.  The old Soweto necktie.  It's a Christmas in Soweto.  It's the old Soweto cardigan.  Soweto, because that's what you do because it's so hot.  For two seconds, then it turns into a screamo.  Yeah, well, you're Soweto because they poured gas on you. 
[03:06:00]  One, two, three, four.  Ah, yes.  Sounds like something else.  Every rose has its store.  One, two, three, four.  Ah, yes.  Let yourself come, let me little Christmas Eve. 
[03:06:30]  Let your heart be alive.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't D, was it?  It had to be.  You heard the horrible Long Island accent.  Yeah, but it's like, unless he's screaming, I guess he can't sing. 
[03:07:00]  It's a shame.  Wow.  Who's putting this in their iPod?  All right, now we're rocking.  Yeah, let's run to the hills.  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. 
[03:07:30]  Are you, D?  We would do this as a goof.  Some silly radio voice guy.  A very heavy metal Christmas.  It's four and a half stars on Amazon.  Really?  What?  Out of 70 reviews.  Good for him.  How many reviews?  71.  All right.  You got Let It Snow, Deck the Halls, Heavy Metal Christmas, 12 Days of a Heavy Metal Christmas. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, that's got to be a douche chill.  All right, we got to do that one.  12 Days of Douches.  We got to do that one.  Here we go.  The 12 Days of Christmas, the heavy metal version.  All right, we got to guess the 12 Days. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  A douche chill in a pear tree.  Okay, the first one.  What would someone into heavy metal?  A Twisted Sister CD.  I would say...  Give me a pen.  Piercings.  It's going to be in there.  Yeah.  Okay, how else would...  Tattoos.  I would say...  Let's see how many of these we can get. 
[03:09:00]  A botched suicider attempt with a shotgun.  That's the first one.  On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...  Five...  No, two.  No, no, I'm thinking five.  Yeah, to get him in order would be a miracle.  Hold on.  Five golden...  Two groupie tits to shoot my come-between.  Here we go.  Five golden nose rings.  Oh, I got it.  On the third day of Christmas, my true love gave to me... 
[03:09:30]  Three legs!  And then there's a picture of Paul McCartney and Heather Mills.  Because it's rock and roll kind of.  Heavy metal, though.  All the formats.  Heavy metal.  Oh, whatever.  All right.  It's still a good line.  Heavy metal.  I'd say it's not a good line.  I gave to me a tattoo of Aussie.  A tattoo.  So we got the one already.  Of Aussie.  Of Aussie. 
[03:10:00]  Jimmy, of Aussie.  They shoehorned Aussie in...  What was the word?  A tattoo of Aussie.  Aussie.  What?  Two pairs of Spandex pants.  Oh, we missed that one.  That's an obvious one.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  This is arguably... 
[03:10:30]  Fucking coolest thing ever.  Well, that, okay.  The worst song ever.  We got to go with worst Christmas song ever.  Yeah.  But it had to have airplay.  Dude, that's it.  I don't think it's ever had airplay.  Someone had to have played. 
[03:11:00]  Bob Buckman.  I could just picture him sitting around going...  We're not going to go to 12, aren't we?  What are we going to do?  There's no way we go to 12.  You know what you do?  Four quarts of jack.  You just fast forward it to 12 and...  Ah, that's a great idea.  Count down once.  That's a great idea.  Find out what they all were. 
[03:11:30]  All in one fucking...  All right.  ...fell swoop.  That's a great idea.  Why would we sit through this?  All right.  We'll do it from here.  11?  I want 12.  What the one?  Fuck.  I want 12.  We need 12.  We're going with 12.  I couldn't hear you even tell what 11 was. 
[03:12:00]  This is going to be about 12, hopefully.  Hold on.  See if we can actually hear this.  12 day.  12 day.  There's a platform.  Five matter t-shirt.  Hey.  There's a gram.  Shack.  Leather jacket.  Hey.  Hands of hands, right?  Could you put that back where you put it in the first place? 
[03:12:30]  I'm amazed that this thing didn't break, man.  Come on, whale it. 
[03:13:00]  Watch, little Jimmy.  Holy shit.  Nice.  Did that CD come apart?  Nice.  Where are we at?  That's how Twisted Sister laughs.  Yeah, let's say hi to Brian in Seattle.  Brian.  Yo.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, speaking of Aussie, there was a really shitty version of walking in a winter wonderland  that Aussie did with Jessica Simpson about four or five years ago.  Wow.  You guys will be able to find that. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  I would like to.  Sharon Singh's backup on it's really shitty.  Oh.  Is it the worst Christmas song ever, though?  Absolutely not.  Van Halen's new one, Rockin' Christmas, is the worst by far.  Rockin', rockin' Christmas.  Yeah, it needs a little more.  Yeah.  It's chilled out a bit.  Yeah.  Don't let grandma have the Christmas brownies.  Oh.  Because you know the Christmas brownies.  Like, ah, then I'll be eating them and, like, acting crazy at the party. 
[03:14:00]  The fast parts really kill me.  Which part?  When you fast talk.  Oh.  Don't let grandma eat the Christmas brownies.  Yeah.  Because I could just imagine David Lee Roth doing that.  He's got the Santa hat on in the video.  Oh, shut up.  You know he does, right?  No, he doesn't.  And he's bringing all the girls.  Like, they open a box for the president.  It's him.  He jumps out in the Santa hat.  No, stop.  That's their gift.  Oh, my God.  Good.  And he opens his box and it's waxed lips and a good tongue. 
[03:14:30]  It's a wife who doesn't dump him.  Good tongue.  It's a fuckin' bullfrog tongue.  Tape this on so you don't talk like fuckin' Blair's Cuss and Jerry are bugging everyone.  Stop trying to harmonize back up with that fuckin' heel you call a tongue.  It's annoying us.  Jamie's crying.  Yeah, she. 
[03:15:00]  Invite David Lee Roth over to lick his stamps.  I've got to mail a letter, please.  Pew.  Did you find the Aussie one?  No.  No, huh?  All right.  Let's say hi to Jose in Texas.  Jose.  Yo, fellas.  How's it going?  What's up, man?  I've got a song I've got to recommend.  It's not the worst.  It's probably one of the best.  It's by the Vandals called It's Christmas Time for My Penis. 
[03:15:30]  It's a beautiful holiday cheer, so you guys got to check it out.  Never heard of it, sir.  Have one of them bastards back there.  Google it or something for you.  It's a great song.  Actually, the whole album is very anti-holiday-like, and I love it.  I play it every year, full blast in my car.  Groovy.  Wow, look at this commercial of all these women in PJs.  PJs, PJs with, oh, it's a pajama gram. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, look at that, man.  We're getting very busty women to do their pajama gram ads on TV.  We don't have another one.  Christmas for my penis, what a surprise.  All right.  Yeah, they're showing some sexy women in these.  You've got to get the size for your fat-ass fucking pig that you're with.  That's got to suck.  I've just seen the hot chicks on TV. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Oh, look, she's taking it off.  God damn.  This is a really long pajama gram spot.  Damn.  Showing a little ace, throwing the red bra.  She's ready for action.  She's giving the guy a little fashion show.  Yeah, she's modeling for the guy.  She's got a rod.  No hot chick would wear that comfy thing they just showed.  You never know.  Christmas morning would come down.  Well, the guy would be all excited about that, though.  How does it soak up pre-cum? 
[03:17:00]  That's what I want to know.  It's silk with a big flannel circle on the front.  To keep all, and that's what they say,  to keep his cumsies from wrecking everything.  It's fucking silk, and they just sewed in a sham wow.  In the front.  Ring that out, fucker.  Yeah.  She's drinking a big cup of jizz.  Instead of eggnog.  She's lactose intolerant and makes her fart.  All right, there's some fucking going on now. 
[03:17:30]  They just shut the door.  And the sign said, relaxation in progress.  Yeah.  What is that?  It means she's going to be sucking his dick.  A Yankee Cranky?  Fucking massage.  He got, uh, David got his dick yanked, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh, came and everything?  Yeah.  All right, good for him.  Yeah, he's not here today.  Good for him.  Did he sound any different about life, or?  Um, yeah, actually he did.  Yeah?  Liked it?  He loved it. 
[03:18:00]  Good.  He'll probably be in tomorrow.  We can talk to him about it.  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a quick break,  and we'll finish up next.  Opiate Anthony.

It's the first five seconds looped over and over and over again.  That's why it sucks.  It rots.  Yeah.  That rots.  I haven't heard that in years.  Yeah, I know.  That rots.  That rots. 
[03:20:00]  That's a hunk of junk.  When something rotted, it was really bad.  It was terrible.  You rot.  It's just decomposing and stinking.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  You want to do the old lady thing before we get out of here?  The old lady thing?  The old lady that graduated college.  Ah, one of these.  We get one of these every year.  This is wonderful. 
[03:20:30]  This is, uh...  They always talk about how uplifting it is.  I don't know who it's uplifting for.  I guess the school that gets the money from the old broad for absolutely nothing.  What compels people of that age to go back to school?  Are they bored, shitless?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Can't you just, like, learn stuff on the internet from your home?  Yeah.  Why do you need a degree at 85 years old?  I don't get it.  I get people that go back to school in their 30s and their 40s, maybe. 
[03:21:00]  Maybe.  Try to change their fucking life around.  Yeah.  They want to do something completely different.  Maybe even in their early 50s.  After that, stop.  That's a little too late, too, I think.  Well, like I said, the early 50s is definitely pushing it.  But 85, these are those feel-good stories the news likes to do.  And there's nothing feel-goody about this.  I don't believe I did it.  The celebration is obviously for her.  Yeah.  For what they're celebrating could amaze anyone.  Today I'm celebrating my graduation, which is tomorrow. 
[03:21:30]  That's right.  Graduation.  From Metropolitan State.  From living to dead.  You're graduating from a viable human being into fucking bug food.  Wait, shit.  Congratulations.  Here's your hat, you old bag.  Here's your diploma as a rolled-up shroud.  Put it over your face.  Yeah, hand this when you fucking cross the river, river Karen or Charon.  Whatever that shitty devil river is. 
[03:22:00]  From Metropolitan State, College of Denver.  At 85, she'll be the oldest Metro State grad in history.  But Winifred Jennings meant to finish school a long time ago.  I had gone to Columbia University for a year back in 41.  Then the war ended and all the boys came home.  Slut.  And I got married and had family.  And that was the end of my education.  Well, the family grew up 20, 30 years ago. 
[03:22:30]  What happened?  Then the war ended.  Which one?  Revolutionary?  She's old to see.  Until the passing of her husband.  That's when the grandmother of 16 made up her mind to go back to school.  Mom just couldn't sit still.  She never could.  She was always doing things.  She's got Parkinson's.  Mom could never sit still.  She has the old Parkinson's. 
[03:23:00]  She goes off like a paint shaker.  She majored in knocking things off the desk during lectures.  She never could.  She was always doing things.  So the behavioral science major took to the classrooms full of 20-somethings and blew them away.  Yes, I got more A's than B's.  My lowest was B.  Cheers.  It's probably a D.  You put a line through your cheating old fuck.  Taking two courses at a time, she slowly reached her goal. 
[03:23:30]  Finally, it's done.  I guess we're done eight years now.  It's a nine-year program.  Nine years.  I don't have any words for it.  It's just so awesome.  So surely, after so much work, this grandma graduate is ready to start a career.  Oh, gosh, no.  No way.  For now, it's still all about the well-deserved celebration.  Then what the fuck did she do that for? 
[03:24:00]  There's no reason.  That's just...  Take classes.  That makes no sense.  On a dumb computer.  Just so she could annoy the 20-somethings that are trying to fucking actually make a career.  You know, let me tell you about my grandchildren.  Shut up, hag.  Oh, use her old fucking useless uterus as a book bag.  Where's your math book?  Right here.  Let me drop it on the floor. 
[03:24:30]  This old useless fucking thing used to pump out kids fucking decades ago.  Are you saying that's where she carries her books?  Yes, indeed.  Fucking hilarious.  Fucking womb is great.  All the other students throw their gloves in there in the winter.  That's how she's popular.  She uses her twat as an umbrella holder.  She's a cubby.  A little fucking cubby hole.  She's her own locker, yeah.  Well, God love the old dear.  God love her.  There you go. 
[03:25:00]  I don't get it.  You're starting a career.  Oh, jeez, no.  That would be crazy.  You're crazier than going to school for nine years?  Nine years?  Start at 76 then, right?  For what?  What did she get a degree in?  Behavioral science?  Yeah, behavioral science.  What the hell is that going to get you?  What does that get you, by the way?  You're a profiler for the police department?  Behavioral science.  I don't know what it is.  After the war. 
[03:25:30]  After my husband died.  She just was out on the prowl, I think.  Trying to be a G-Milf.  A G-Milf.  I think we go for the early exit today.  Yeah, it's in order, I would say.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How come we're not doing line of the day anymore?  We should start doing that again.  We rested it.  Yeah, we're resting it.  It just got to the point where... 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, we'll bring it back, but it needs to be rested.  It is brought to you by DirecTV, though.  Yeah, why would we be rested if they're buying the thing?  My nose itches.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  DirecTV.  Sponsors, line of the day, or what did we learn?  Whatever the hell we're going to end up doing at the end of the show.  It's brought to you by DirecTV.  That's nice.  What is that, one of those satellites?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's like the space age. 
[03:26:30]  We used to be on DirecTV.  But do you put that on your roof or something?  And it catches things from outer space?  It's fascinating.  Oh!  What happened to her?  Grandma the beaten.  Oh, did they just show a beaten old grandma?  Oh, man.  They got to show her face again.  Three teens charged with kidnapping and torture of a 75-year-old woman.  She was laying in the hospital bed, pummeled.  I guess she didn't want to remove that hat.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  Oh, boy.  That looks good.  Who the fuck would...  Who would beat up grandma like that?  The white hair really sets it off.  Wow.  What's that?  The son?  He's just looking to beat the living piss out of somebody.  Yeah.  That son's a big boy.  Son or grandson.  Oh, that's what she looked like before the beating.  Jesus Christ.  Nice Christmas beating.  She got thrown.  What happened?  Home invasion?  Did we get the audio of this?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[03:27:30]  Oh.  Look how yellow she is.  I don't know.  She's alive, though.  I mean, at least she didn't fucking kill her.  And then red.  Her eyeballs are all fucked up.  And she goes on TV.  Do you think she asked for makeup?  Like, what could they possibly do?  Damn, she got fucked up.  Wow.  Wow, she looked like a burn victim at first.  Look at the fucking son.  He's holding her hand.  You can see how...  He has a murderous...  Like, he looks very calm.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Her son has a murderous look on his face. 
[03:28:00]  He wants revenge in the worst way.  It's the type of face you see when a gun is just quietly pointed at you and bullets are  pumped at you.  Yeah.  That's it.  He is angry.  God, I'd love to know what this is.  Teens kidnapping and torture.  What did they do?  So, it's just breaking.  We'll find out more.  Is it carjacking?  I don't know.  La Mesa, California. 
[03:28:30]  Can't pull anything up on Google News.  Looking.  Working.  Man, they bashed her in the jaw.  For 26 hours, they tortured her?  75-year-old grandmother was strangled, punched, kicked, bound in duct tape and thrown in the trunk of her own car by three young adults.  After 26 hours without food or water, made a silent plea to God, either save me or let me die, she said. 
[03:29:00]  I told God that, her face still swollen and marked by ugly purple bruises.  Then I asked my late husband, who had just died, I said, don't tell God to help me.  Wait, don't tell God?  That doesn't make sense.  I said, oh, Don, tell God to help me.  She's like, wait, she's asking her ex or her dead husband to leave a message for God. 
[03:29:30]  That night he helped me.  The sheriffs came and they rescued me because I wouldn't have lasted too much longer.  She was in the hospital for a few days, badly beaten that she couldn't even speak at first,  but by Monday, the spirited woman who loves to dance was feeling well enough to get her hair done,  put on a nice dress, and talked to Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  Oh, who were the pieces of shit that did that?  Yes.  Who was arrested?  We're still, I have, I have bruises on my body because they kicked me and hit me and everything.  Ah, they hit me and kicked me. 
[03:30:00]  They break my teeth.  Oh, here we go.  All right.  A little scam action.  What?  The grandma, this whole thing started about a week ago, Monday, December 8th,  when she bought a vacuum cleaner from a door-to-door salesman identified as Jeffrey Edward Nelson, 19.  That night, she said he returned to her home and asked to use the phone.  Oh, boy.  He said his girlfriend had kicked him out and could have used my phone to call his mother.  So the guy gets her comfortable. 
[03:30:30]  She recognizes him from selling the vacuum a day earlier.  He comes back.  Yeah.  And then he comes back and...  Picture.  All right.  He said his girlfriend kicked him out.  Picture of the perp.  Let him in.  I said, yes, you can.  So I showed him where the phone was.  As I turned to walk away, that's when he choked me from behind.  She lost consciousness.  And when she woke, she was in the trunk area of her Dodge Magnum station wagon.  Yuck.  Bound with duct tape so she couldn't move.  They stole my car. 
[03:31:00]  They stole me in my own car, she said.  That was awful.  Two others were in the car with Nelson, another man, 18, another guy, and a chick, 18.  Paul R. Nelson.  For the next 26 hours, police say the three abductors drove around with her in the trunk  using her credit cards to buy gas and other items.  They never offered anything to her.  And when she asked for something to drink because she was desperately thirsty, one of  the men smashed her in the face with his fist.  Oh, assholes. 
[03:31:30]  Can I have something to drink?  Whammo.  These fucking...  All you can hope for is that these fucking...  Just these little pieces of shit are released in the general population of a fucking...  Of a jail.  Absolutely.  They'll be all tidied up in suits with their head all down in front of the judge and their  stupid scum lawyer will talk about what great kids they are and how they did this and that  and talk about shit from 10 years ago that they did.  And since they didn't kill her, they'll wind up getting a light rap on this one. 
[03:32:00]  Fucking idiot.  I was so taped and bound I couldn't even move to protect myself.  He was driving crazy and I was bouncing all over the place.  Finally, on Tuesday, a police officer saw the car committing a traffic violation, gave  chase and stopped the car.  The officer found me in the back when the duct tape was removed.  It took my skin with it in some places.  They were arrested and charged with a number of crimes, including kidnapping and assault.  They were arraigned on Friday.  Pleaded not guilty, of course. 
[03:32:30]  An in-court TV camera zoomed in on Nelson.  A muscular young man with buzz-cut hair and showed him rolling his eyes as the charges  against him were read.  This is the most...  It's hard to believe someone would do that.  For what?  For what?  Some credit card charges a few bucks on a bottle of booze.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Life goes on.  Oh, booze?  Okay.  It keeps going on. 
[03:33:00]  It's a really long article.  Did she owe money on her hat?  It's the only question I have.  Because, you know.  So she's staying positive and blah blah.  That's fucking...  I can't...  It's like...  All you hope for is that the reality of fucking...  Hopefully...  If not getting fucked in the ass or mouth...  Yeah.  ...by another...  By a convict. 
[03:33:30]  You just hope that some...  Because there's no convicts that like a kid who punched a 76-year-old woman.  No.  They all have mothers, man.  No one likes that shit.  Beat the piss out of her like that?  Yeah.  Oh, there they are, huh?  Yeah, that's wonderful.  What's the one on the left?  Is that a chick?  The girl.  It's a fat, ugly girl.  Yeah, there's a chick.  Fat, ugly chick.  Two dudes and one chick.  There's a dude with like...  What is that?  Some fucking white boy dreads?  Is that what he's rocking there?  Almost looks like the lead center of the Counting Crows.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  And then there's that buzz cut fat fucking looking baby Huey motherfucker.  Well, yeah.  They look like a couple of guys that are gonna get their comeuppance in the gernt.  Yeah.  If that fucking grandson or son, whatever he was, doesn't fucking kill him in the courtroom.  That could be some great courtroom video gonna be on YouTube watching him lunge over the...  They'll be well protected.  That's what's gonna happen to these kids.  That fucking... 
[03:34:30]  That fucking son had just a quiet, murderous look on his face.  How do you look at your mom all beat up like that and not just want to kill...  Especially...  Yeah.  Whoever did it.  You gotta want to kill them.  Especially when you know that they had 26 hours to drive around and think about it and she asked for water and they punched...  Yeah, punched her in the face.  There's no cases under which it wouldn't be enraging.  Maybe she said, hey, cocksucker, give me some water. 
[03:35:00]  Or maybe not.  All right.  Go to DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  I think that does it for today.  We'll have more on that story tomorrow, I'm sure.  All right.  Jimmy, any plugs?  You good?  I actually forgot.  I gotta do Atlantic City...  Thank you.  January 16th and 17th.  One of the shows is sold out.  Nice.  One is almost sold out.  Ooh.  I think it's Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday weekend and holiday weekend out at the Borgata. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  So go to theborgata.com and New Year's Eve, I booked a gig in Allentown.  I put everything on black on that day.  All right.  At the casino.  You might as well.  Yay!  Just give it a try.  Hey, I booked a gig in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  I forget where it was.  It's on New Year's Eve.  I'm such a dumb bag of shit.  Oh, it's a weird club.  There's a weird name to it, I remember.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, Crocodile Rock.  Yeah, Crocodile Rock.  It's on Hamilton Street, Allentown, PA. 
[03:36:00]  Tickets are only $30, which is actually very cheap.  For New Year's Eve, tickets are usually $75 tickets.  It's $30, man.  I never have my tickets.  And it's an 8 o'clock show, so you can go out and do what you want after.  You're not stuck there all fucking...  Crocodile Rock?  Yeah, I might walk onto the Elton Johnstone and pump my fist.  Yeah, pump your fist up.  Say, I know where I am.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Crocodile Rock.  Maybe I'll bring on...  Remember Chocodiles?  Yes.  Those chocolate things?  And I'll go, I thought they said Chocodile Rock.  And then I'll eat one.  Waka waka.  The whole crowd will go fucking nuts, man.  Because of New Year's Eve. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people want to party.  Yeah, fucking have Chocodiles.  Yeah.  Or maybe I'll wear alligator shoes.  You know, I thought it said Alligator Rock.  No.  Or maybe I'll walk out with a big clock and go, oh, I thought this was Crocodile Rock.  Or maybe I'll have my pants unzipped and you know what I'll say when I walk out.  Or maybe I'll try selling a baby on eBay and I'll say, I thought this was Haka Child Rock. 
[03:37:00]  Jesus.  Turn off the power.  I can't take the stink in here.  Why?  Coming from these jokes.  Well, then maybe you walk on stage with me and I'll punch that smile and say, I thought it was Knock-A-Smile Rock.  Or maybe I'll put some blood in the safe and say, I'm sorry, I thought it was Lock-A-Vile Rock. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, why not?  Are we done?  No.  So maybe I'll throw up into one of my socks and go, oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.  I thought it was Sock-A-Bile Rock.  Do you know one time I spit over 5,000 feet? 
[03:38:00]  Really?  Yes!  I said, I'm sorry, I thought this was Haka Mile Rock.  You know?  Yeah, sure.  I understand how you can mistake Crocodile Rock for other names.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Or maybe I'll take all of Anthony's guns and spill them onto the stage and go, oh, my God, silly me.  I thought this was Glock-A-Pile Rock. 
[03:38:30]  I don't own a Glock.  I know you don't.  Or maybe I'll talk to Susan Smith and borrow her van and go, oh, my God, I'm sorry.  I thought this was Glock-A-Chile Rock.  It's New Year's Eve. 
[03:39:00]  Allentown PA.  Crocodile Rock.  Crocodile, I think that's the name of it.  I keep mixing it up.  Yeah, with other things, but it happens.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm ready to go.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  I mean, just thinking.  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah.  I was, too, but then I said, fuck it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, meh.  Wait.  Why would I possibly try to do better?  Well, I thought that I would fuck Eric Nagel in the face and ass and go, oh, I thought I said I was supposed to be an Iraq-A-Pile Rock.  That's what happens when you rape a blithering idiot. 
[03:40:00]  You're called an Iraq-A-Pile.  Sorry, Eric.  You're still at it?  Oh, dude.  It's nonstop.  One good one out of 30.  Oh, my.  Do you think I would have fucking just quit?  Yeah.  I know. 
[03:40:30]  Well, maybe I'll play some music.  I mean, hey.  Why not?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was going to be Jock-A-Wile Rock.  Oh, okay.  Okay, look.  Is that bad?  I'm done.  I should have quit after Dr. Child.  I'd rather, yeah.  We're back.  Okay.  Everyone, see you later tomorrow.  And we have Greg Gutfeld coming in, and we're out. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Bye. </pre>
