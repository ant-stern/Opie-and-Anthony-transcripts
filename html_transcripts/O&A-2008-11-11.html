<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about Veterans Day, focusing on veteran humor and stereotypes, transitioning to President Bush's visit to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and a humorous tangent on the show "How It's Made," detailing the often absurd and unpleasant manufacturing processes of diapers and sardines.  Opie shared infidelity concealment strategies, and the conversation moved to the prevalence of local radio shows, the complexity of machinery, and the harsh realities of manual labor. Callers Rob (detailing machine manufacturing) and an ex-space shuttle parts inspector (who stole silver rods and copper pipes) contributed to the discussion, which then shifted to the 2008 economic downturn and widespread radio layoffs, including the rumored “Grim Reaper” firing employees.

The show then focused on Jim Norton's book, "I Hate Your Guts," specifically a chapter on his Little League experiences. This led to discussions on poor customer service (especially at Starbucks), tip jars (including those in adult bookstores), Michelle Obama's appearance, the state of the White House after a change in administration, and a caller's anecdote about a voter unaware of presidential term limits. The show teased upcoming segments on pubic fashion trends, alcohol vapor mist consumption, and the “perv switch,” illustrated by dentists' inappropriate behavior with patients, concluding with a story about a jeweler arrested for sexual assault. Jim Florentine was announced as a future guest.

A humorous anecdote about a gynecologist making inappropriate comments about a patient's underwear opened the next segment, quickly transitioning to the news story about 56-year-old jeweler "Fairy Doon Gavami" arrested for assaulting an 18-year-old.  The hosts and a caller speculated on the assault, discussing sexual thoughts and self-control.  The conversation shifted to Joe Scarborough's profanity on MSNBC and the double standard for profanity on television versus radio, leading to a heated exchange with a female caller who criticized their language.  The hosts continued debating the double standard, referencing Mike Barnicle and Jay Carney.

Jim Florentine joined the show in studio. They discussed their past relationships, his time on other radio shows, and awkward situations arising from overlapping professional relationships.  Anecdotes about their shared living space with Jim Norton (mold, silverfish, Norton's habits) and their dating lives were shared.  Florentine recounted using improvised containers for sexual encounters during his struggling comedian days, leading to further sexually explicit conversation. The show concluded this segment by discussing Florentine's upcoming comedy club appearances, his VH1 Classic metal show, Steven Adler and Guns N' Roses reunion rumors, and a brief call from a 16-year-old listener upset about the show's DirecTV removal. Bear Grylls, a previous studio guest, was also briefly mentioned.

An interview with Bear Grylls followed, detailing his "Man vs. Wild" experiences in Antarctica (ice climbing, kite-skiing, jet skis, paragliders), Belize, and Turkey, including encounters with dangerous animals (boa constrictor, whip scorpions, brown bear) and sleeping in portaledges.  Jim Florentine again joined the show to discuss his book signings and VH1 Classic metal show, including his negative experiences with Gene Simmons (hitting on Florentine's girlfriend, poor quality adult film).  The segment concluded with news stories about alcohol-soaked tampons and anal beer bongs, discussions of risky behavior and drinking habits, a humorous caller, stolen company swag, a listener's pen request, and an extremely inappropriate commercial for a weight-loss product called "AIDS."

The following segment addressed desensitization to graphic online content (bloodshows.com, comeomelette.com), featuring descriptions of beheadings, burnings, and extreme sexual acts.  Don Jameson joined Jim Florentine and the hosts in studio, with listener calls contributing to the discussion.  The hosts also discussed harassing phone calls from debt collectors, warranty scams, the challenges facing the incoming president, and a tangent on a comedian's genitals.

The final segment was heavily vulgar and sexually explicit, focusing on pubic hair grooming trends at a Beverly Hills salon, including crude slang terms for female genitalia.  The conversation satirized Keith Olbermann's commentary on California Proposition 8, including homophobic remarks. A fabricated *Sex and the City* movie plot was shared, involving rectal cancer, a colostomy bag, and Busta Rhymes.  The hosts also criticized Steve Martin's *Pink Panther* remake and briefly mentioned "Special Delivery with Sam and Dave" and Webex.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Alright, this old gag.  Veterans Day though, my friend.  Yes.  Today?  Yes it is.  Hello to all of our veterans out there.  I'm a big fan of the veteran.  A big, big fan.  Not good enough for the day off though, huh? 
[00:00:30]  What's up with that?  I think we have to entertain the veterans today.  What's up with that?  That are getting ready to march.  They're busy in the parade.  All over this country.  Oh my god, they're marching on the country? What happened?  They want to take over the country.  Revolution.  They see what the F is going on out there and they're getting together like old times sake.  It's disastrous.  Yeah.  Better watch that when they come upon Barat's civilian security force. 
[00:01:00]  I think the veterans could take that one.  Yeah.  Take that one down.  You haven't lived until you hung out with some old veterans.  You want to hear some stereotyping.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  Those boys know a joke or two.  Down at the VFW hall.  Sure.  Sit there and spout out some of the good old jokes.  I miss doing that in Kings Park.  I'll go local.  Yeah.  Kings Park.  That's where my pops used to hang.  To get away from my mom.  And then they would tell jokes to each other. 
[00:01:30]  And they were some doozies.  Oh, and there'd be a black fella right there.  Yeah.  Old black veteran.  He would take it.  Then he'd turn around and then he would tell the WAP jokes.  Sure.  And the WAPs would take it.  And then the WAPs would attack the Polish.  Well, that's easy.  They just went around the room, man.  Beating each other up with the stereotyping.  What of the Irish?  The Irish, of course.  Without saying.  Well, good morning to you veterans out there.  I guess President Bush is in town in Manhattan. 
[00:02:00]  Is he really?  Yep.  He's going to be over at the Intrepid Air and Space Sea Museum.  Whatever the hell they call it.  They rededicated it.  Yeah, they took it away.  They took it away for a while.  A long time.  It's finally back.  It's a huge.  It seems like they just took it.  Remember, it got all bogged down in the mud when they were trying to take it out.  Yeah.  The propellers got all stuck in there.  And that just seemed like, oh, what was that?  Like a couple of months ago?  Yeah.  That was two years.  Was it two years ago?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Now it's back and he's going to be up there.  I think Marine One is going to land on the deck and he's going to step out and give a  little speech.  What the hell is Marine One?  It's one of those huge.  That's his helicopter.  Helicopters?  The presidential helicopter.  You see him waving out of when he gets to the White House.  That just oversized helicopter?  Yeah, that big goofy one.  How the hell does that fly?  Who figured that out?  Amazing.  Apparently a man named Sikorsky in Connecticut. 
[00:03:00]  You ever think of the crap they figured out a long time ago?  And how?  How do they figure that out?  I don't get it.  That's, yeah, you watch that show, How It's Made.  Yeah, that's a cool show.  And you go, who thought this up?  I watched a goddamn show on how they make diapers.  Did you really?  And they, dude, the diapers are running through this machine where a diaper comes out every  like point something of a second.  Yeah.  It's just, and it folds them. 
[00:03:30]  They got folding machines and the things that cut them.  And they got to slow it down so you could actually see what it's doing because it's going  so fast you can't even see anything.  And it's sardines.  How they can sardines.  What an ass job this is.  These poor bastards with these sardines coming down a chute.  And you know it just stinks.  They're all wearing these masks trying to not stink.  Yeah, but if you want to cheat on your wife, perfect job.  You work at the old sardine plant. 
[00:04:00]  Oh my God.  You want to talk about camouflage.  Rough day at the sardine plant, honey.  I got a shower.  Because you used to tell a...  She goes, no, somehow you smell worse today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You used to tell a little story about how you would maybe do a little of that cheating  back in the day.  Oh yeah, yeah.  And make believe you were working on your car and you needed a shower immediately as soon  as you got home.  It worked on two fronts.  It worked on, here's why I'm late.  And then it worked on, don't even come near me.  I stink like gasoline. 
[00:04:30]  I got to oil all over me.  I got to hop in the shower.  God damn car.  Yeah.  And then you act all mad so they don't want to question you because you're in a bad mood.  Right.  So then by the time you shower and everything.  Yeah.  It's like, would you try to siphon the gas out with that?  Why'd you wash it so long?  I was just playing the big stain on the pants.  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.  But yeah, I had an old piece of crap car and you just pop the hood, you stick your fingers 
[00:05:00]  in the old carburetor barrels.  Sure.  Well, that was when you're, you know, before you get out and leave the house, I like to  call her the old carburetor barrels.  You stick your fingers in there and get some gasoline on you.  Yeah.  And then you just got to kind of rub your hand on the valve covers and then smear the  oil around you a little bit and walk in and just go like, ah, God damn. 
[00:05:30]  Grr.  Grr.  You can put a little on your face though.  No, that's overkill.  You'd never do that.  Like they do in movies.  Oh, okay.  He was working on a car.  They make it very obvious for you.  Never on the face.  It's overkill.  It looks like you're trying.  Put it under your eyes like you're playing center field for.  Is that it?  For.  Put your local team here.  So it sounds like a local morning show because that's what radio is all about these days.  Local radio.  Yeah.  It's your friend.  Go screw.  You can figure out your own weather. 
[00:06:00]  You can figure out your own sports scores.  You can figure out your own local news.  Yeah.  But who's going to give you the lofts?  Some local douche?  I don't think so.  Well, apparently they do.  Listening to John Tober.  Right.  Nothing but laughter there.  Look, I don't have a local morning show that I get to listen to.  I already know what the weather's going to be like today.  Yeah.  I already know what roads are going to be closed in New York because of parades.  I made sure none of my teams were playing last night.  You'll listen to the news.  Yeah.  Check it on your smart phones out there. 
[00:06:30]  Everyone's got a smart phone.  But how it's made is amazing.  Yeah.  What's amazing about that show is how do they make, okay, they show you how stuff is made.  Like you said diapers.  I saw one of these shows where they just showed you how to make tofu.  I hate tofu.  Yeah.  But I found it fascinating.  Yeah.  I found it fascinating how all of a sudden it was a block of this crap that the dumb vegetarians eat.  Yeah.  But I had a watch.  I'm in a mood.  I saw my statement. 
[00:07:00]  That whole dumb stock market thing.  I'm like, ah.  Oh, you finally got your this past month statement.  It's called a little lag time, I guess.  I got that one yesterday.  Oofah.  And I think, you know, the people lucky enough to invest a little money, they're feeling exactly what we're feeling today.  Yeah.  Because those October statements finally hit.  My God.  I took a peek at that one and was like, oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God.  That's a big hit.  Yeah.  Oh.  Anyway, so the tofu. 
[00:07:30]  But how do they make, this is what they need to do a show on.  How do they make the machines that make the stuff?  That make the stuff.  Because they have these intricate, like, machines that, you know what I mean?  You realize people have been just taken out of the mix.  Sure.  It's now complete robotics.  I'd said it once before, you know, when we thought about robots when you're a kid or when they thought about it, you know, way back when,  you thought of these humanoid looking robots that would walk around and do things for you. 
[00:08:00]  And that isn't the case.  It's, you know, specialty robots.  But when they're showing the diapers going through and being put in the bag and this blast of air opens the bag up.  Yeah.  And then this pusher thing just shoves the product in.  And then a heat seal clamps down on it and seals it.  And then these vacuum things pick them up.  Yeah.  I was watching how bricks were made.  Ugh.  How do they make bricks?  And the giant tires was another good one.  Boy, that took a long time.  What a pain in the ass job that looks like, though. 
[00:08:30]  And it's like, and he bends the rubber over the tire bead with nothing but sheer strength.  And this poor bastard's pulling rubber.  That's his whole job is to pull rubber over the metal.  Oh, it's a horrible job.  They couldn't find a machine to do that?  Dude, that show makes me feel really good sometimes because I'll watch it and I'll see these factory workers.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Thank God I'm not him.  That's all I was thinking was, that is the worst job ever.  Until the next one I go, no, that's the worst job.  It's like you just pump your fists and join and you go, I'm not the taffy puller. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  I'm not the taffy puller.  Well, so to speak.  They should just call that show, thank God I don't do that.  Look at the stuff that you should thank your God that you're not doing.  Yeah.  Horrible jobs.  You know, I was walking on the sidewalk the other day and I saw one of those, thank God I don't do that jobs.  What was it?  Jack Hammer.  Huh?  Jack Hammer.  How the F do those guys survive?  How the F do they survive?  How is it 2008 and they're still doing, it's the same technology they used way, way back to break apart concrete and stuff. 
[00:09:30]  Where are the lasers to go and cut the holes in concrete and then the disintegrator gun to disintegrate the part that you just cut with the laser?  Why are you still going, ba?  What?  You know.  What happened to our future?  I imagine those guys go home and they're in a really bad mood.  Beat their wives.  They have to be in a bad mood.  Their whole body is shot. 
[00:10:00]  Horrid.  And you go through that just to knock off what?  A four by four piece of concrete maybe?  Four inch by four inch if you're lucky?  You watch him and it's so frustrating just to watch because he's trying to knock this one piece off that's maybe on an angle and the thing keeps slipping off of the piece.  He's like, get it!  Just hit it with a hammer.  Yeah.  What does that do to your body?  We don't need to officially know.  Shake it apart.  I can't imagine it's good.  I bet he doesn't get kidney stones. 
[00:10:30]  Everything just rattles.  His kidneys come out.  Probably no kidney stones and your arteries are nice and clean.  Yeah, everything just shakes down to your feet.  It'd be fun to eat.  All the bad stuff.  Just hold food in front of his mouth.  He's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  He can just chew it.  Actually, it does kind of mess with your circulation because Discovery does have another program called Time Warp where they do things and then slow it down on high speed footage.  They actually did the guy jackhammering stuff.  So they give you some of the science behind it.  And actually, if somebody jackhammers for a living, they could develop circulation. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, boy, did I feel for that guy.  They should just have Michael J. Fox do it and he looks normal when he's doing it.  Right, right.  He's just standing completely still.  It cancels him out.  Let's say hi to Fontaine.  Fontaine?  Yo, Fontaine.  Boy, is we at a talk show now, boy?  Oh, linger, linger.  Bruce Whitman, boy.  We should do a whole where are they now with all the people that thought they knew radio better than we did. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, well, they're still lining up.  A good 14 years later, we're still doing it and most of these guys are long gone.  Rumor has it one of the guys is a greeter at a supermarket.  But back when we were doing this in Boston, he really thought he knew better than we.  We've got to find out if that's true.  If it's true, it's over, Johnny.  We can't make fun of him ever again.  That's an official we win.  Let's not rub it in anymore.  I feel sorry for the guy.  What's up, Fontaine?  Anthony, you were talking about sex and having all that grease smeared all over you.  Yeah.  Isn't that what you looked like a couple of days over the past summer with, uh, anyway? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, God.  I was spreading grease on myself.  No, I must say, I don't think I ever got any grease on me.  Yeah, all right.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, they want, whenever you see, like, how it's made, you see these automated machines  making this stuff.  They wanted a whole show on the machines of how it's made and how they make these automated  machines.  You know, it's just, it's just pretty interesting how they, um...  All right, but they need a machine. 
[00:12:30]  ...high speed.  What's that?  Yeah, they need a machine to make the machine.  Yeah, the thing is...  It always boils down to just...  More machines.  ...after a while, you know, it's, uh, it's just all automated shit that, oh, sorry.  Sorry, guys.  You know what it is with those, uh, with those machines, though?  They're one-offs.  They're not, like, mass-produced machines to do this in a factory, so it really is kind  of, uh, exclusive work.  You can't, you can't mass-produce the machine that makes one thing at one factory. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  So, because I used to work at a lot of machine shops growing up, and, uh, it's just these  engineers, these guys that are really good at milling and engineering, and they go in  there, and I used to work a big Bridgeport milling machine.  Mm-hmm.  I was, I wasn't very good at it, because I didn't have the patience that these old German  engineers and Russian guys, uh, had, uh, but you see these guys working it?  Oh.  They make these parts out of these, just take a little block of aluminum, and then when  it's done, it just looks like something like, I, I knew it came from somewhere, but I didn't 
[00:13:30]  know people just kind of made these things.  It was art.  Yeah, it's like an art foil, it really is.  And, and then they put me in the mechanical inspection part of the, uh, uh, shop where  I had to sit there with micrometers and calipers and, and things, and make sure everything was  within, like, a few thousandths of an inch, um, tolerance.  And, uh, then I got fired from that job because I think I was doing acid.  Were you really?  Yeah.  I think I took some acid with my friends a few times. 
[00:14:00]  And it was, uh, it was working at a place that made relays that went in the space shuttle.  Oh, good.  So, and I was inspecting the contacts and how far between the contacts, uh.  So when the first one went, uh, kablooey, were you thinking, uh-oh.  I was thinking, uh-oh.  Might have been the acid trip.  Was that me?  And that was the, the place, they used to make contacts, and contacts are made out of, uh,  pretty precious metals, silver and gold and stuff.  And they made these contacts out of silver.  And these huge silver rods would be put in these machines, and little pieces would be 
[00:14:30]  cut off.  Little nubs.  Chik-gunk, chik-gunk, chik-gunk.  And then you'd end up with this tray of just silver little slivers that would end up contacts.  I used to take the silver, uh, uh, rods and wrap them around my legs and cover them with  my pants and for lunch go to this we-buy-silver-and-gold place.  I'd walk in and unwrap them from my legs.  They didn't care.  No questions asked.  Are you going to steal the, are you going to steal your own copper pipes from your house  and try to resell them? 
[00:15:00]  That's it.  Just sawzall them all out.  I did that at a house I was working at, too.  It was a demolition job.  I was supposed to be taking out these cast iron radiators from this crawl space in this  mansion out in Glen Cove or somewhere, uh, North Shore, Long Island.  And we had to go in there and pretty much lay down on our sides, because the crawl space  wasn't big enough, and smashed these cast iron things with, uh, sledgehammers.  It was one of those jobs that if I saw, I'd go, oh my God, I would never want to do that  job.  And there I was doing it.  And the inside of these things are covered with soot, so you get, you know, the pack 
[00:15:30]  in and covered in, in just soot and everything.  Uh, so me and my, uh, my work partner there decided, well, we're going to, you know, take,  make a little money for ourselves and took the sawzalls out and took every piece of copper  pipe from that house.  And it was giant four story mansion.  One of those Gold Coast old, like, uh, great Gatsby houses.  Sure.  Nice.  And there we were at the scrapyard cashing in.  Hey, got enough for some beer.  You know, copper wasn't going for that much back then. 
[00:16:00]  I love that the scrap people never ask questions.  No questions asked at the scrapyard.  Nope.  You gotta love it.  That's why some of these guys that come in with power lines, you always hear about somebody  getting electrocuted, trying to steal the copper or aluminum from, uh, power lines and  stuff like that.  Uh, where are they offing this stuff?  The scrapyard.  They don't care.  Yeah, here you go.  They might give you a cheaper price because they know some shenanigans took place, but  you still get a few bucks.  All right.  Uh, and that's how we begin today.  877-212-0188. 
[00:16:30]  Lots of phone calls coming in.  We'll, uh, we'll see what you guys are all about in a few minutes here.  And, uh, I guess that's it for now.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  I want to say good morning to everybody that's unemployed this morning.  I was watching the news yesterday.  DHL, what?  Let go 9,200 people?  9,500.  9,500 people?  Wow.  Circuit City closing what? 
[00:17:00]  150 stores, something like that?  And going bankrupt.  Right before the holidays.  Why are they some scumbags?  Right before Christmas?  Well, Circuit City, they're going to keep their stores open for the holiday, quote, rush,  which isn't going to be much of a rush this time around.  Let me tell you something about Circuit City.  I went there the, uh, like last week.  I was looking.  First, first I go to Best Buy, because, uh, I think that's what everyone does.  And they did not have what I wanted.  So there was a Circuit City close by.  So I went there.  I waited for 20 minutes. 
[00:17:30]  I stood there just to see how long I would stand there before anybody gave me any assistance.  Because I didn't see the product that I wanted to buy.  Uh, so I was thinking maybe there would be, you know, one in the back or something like that.  And, uh, the people working there were horrid.  Just, really, you could tell they fired anybody who knew anything, whatever they knew at the time, I don't know.  And hired just the dregs of society that have no clue. 
[00:18:00]  Even the, the, the most simple customer service, uh, they could not handle.  So, uh, I shan't be going back.  And I guess, uh, a lot of other people won't either, because they're going bankrupt.  They opened a brand new one, uh, about 10, 15 blocks away from here.  Oh, good idea.  I went in there for some, uh, birthday shopping.  There was no one in the joint.  And the rent in Manhattan is just ridiculous.  And I'm, I'm, I'm walking around going, how are they affording this? 
[00:18:30]  Yep.  I mean, if, uh, the, the space was so large, you, you need people just marching through this place.  Mm-hmm.  Just marching through, uh, to, to make, uh, you know, make your bills or whatever.  It looks crappy.  Make your rent, I should say.  Yeah.  It just looks kind of junky.  Like, Best Buy at least looks like a, a good store.  Yeah.  This one on that they built recently, I know what you mean.  It's like, ugh.  I know the Best Buy I go to, uh, near my, my house is, uh, yeah.  So there's always people in there.  Yeah.  They keep it nice. 
[00:19:00]  It's like, uh, real good stuff.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You could browse the DVDs.  And they know what they're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not, when they're really busy, it is a bitch to get somebody to help you.  You're just like, eh.  And then, it never fails.  You, you, you'll be walking around and, and you'll have three people come up.  Can I help you?  Can I help you?  No, no, no, no.  And then the second you find what you need, and you need them to get it or something,  they're just, you can't find anybody.  Yeah.  Reminds me of my Murphy's Law poster.  Oh, right?  Back to that Murphy's Law poster. 
[00:19:30]  As long as, I've been going into Bed Bath & Beyond, um, and I have to buy, yes, I have  a lot of, a lot, like three times in the last week.  No.  And I have to buy some empty shoe boxes for my shoe, because I bought like a little shoe  thing for when you walk in.  Ugh.  A little place to put your shoes now.  So, so that your wet shoes don't, uh.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's just, I, I had a, uh, no, no, no, no, no.  I have to get like, it's like, you stack your shoes.  It's like a little wooden thing.  I don't know what you mean.  I have to get like a little rug for my shoe area. 
[00:20:00]  But what, but your shoe area is by your front door?  I have a designated shoe area.  You take your shoes off the second you get in the house?  What, am I going to track duty all over the place?  Just leave them in the hall.  No, I can't.  No one's going to take your shoes in the hall.  You don't wipe your feet.  Security will tell you that you have to move them.  You used to live among.  Security, move your shoes.  It's a fire hazard.  You used to live with black mold.  How is your shoes a fire hazard?  Anything.  They burst into flames, shoes.  Uh, anything in the hallway can't be left.  So I don't, I don't mind.  I, I bring my shoes into the designated shoe area. 
[00:20:30]  And like if I have girls off, I'll go look.  I have to make a duty.  I'll meet you by the shoe area in a jiff.  And then they meet me by the shoe area.  The worst.  Why?  This is awful.  I talk to, I tell girls I want to meet them by the designated shoe area.  The designated shoe area.  And that is by the front door.  It is.  And we'll stand there and we'll look down and we'll, we'll talk and we'll gesture towards  the shoes.  I've got it all worked out.  All right.  Listen, whore.  I'll meet you by the shoes.  Get over there before I blacken your eye. 
[00:21:00]  There you go.  Circuit City.  Here's the headline.  Circuit City's plan to fire.  3,400 will have ripple effects.  Of course it will.  Because now all these people are looking for jobs.  With the other people that are looking for jobs.  Unemployed.  This isn't the story about them filing for bankruptcy.  This is a story from over a year ago when they fired the initial 3,400 people that led.  Oh, okay.  What were you talking about in the office?  Okay.  What happened with Circuit City?  People that knew what they were doing, they fired those people.  So we're making too much money.  Because they were making too much money.  Okay.  I gotcha.  Which leads to what we're talking about today where you walk around this joint and no 
[00:21:30]  one knows what the hell they're doing.  Yeah.  And it said it right here a year ago that it will have a ripple effect.  You can't fire people that are knowledgeable and want to help you.  Well.  And replace them with people that are one job away from hitting you over the head with  a brick.  Or not replace them at all.  To feed their, quote, family.  Or not replace them at all.  Right.  That sounds like a familiar situation.  Mm.  Where they fire people left and right and don't replace anybody and things just fall apart.  Kind of like what's happening in radio?  Comes apart, yeah, at the seams. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, well.  They started firing the receptionists at radio stations.  Yeah.  So now you can't even like, ah, I used to like going to a radio station.  You're like, hi, who are you here to see?  Yeah.  Well, I won Leonard Skinner tickets.  All right, sit over there.  Yeah, now.  They don't have that person.  Nothing.  Now you got to kind of knock on the door and hope someone hears you to get your tickets.  Yeah.  I heard there was like an intern or something doing that job here.  Yep.  This isn't like, this isn't a small radio market.  And it's two stations. 
[00:22:30]  Two stations, huh?  Unbelievable what is going on.  Well.  We are really in a financial crap storm.  Yeah.  It, uh, it's really grim.  I don't know.  I don't even.  There's somebody they're calling the Grim Reaper that's going from, you know, right?  The Grim Reaper is going from station to station here in New York.  Yeah.  And, uh, I, I got a text from somebody and they're like, oh boy, the Grim Reaper's back  today.  It's definitely a person they have, uh, designated to fire people in radio and they're just going 
[00:23:00]  from station to station.  And the Grim Reaper was at this particular station last week and came back yesterday again to  chop off some more heads.  Oh, so that hurts.  Yeah.  At least, you know, back in, uh, like 99, 2000, when that internet bubble burst and everybody  lost a bunch of money there.  And it wasn't this bad because, uh, all the other sectors were still fine.  It was everybody.  It was so loaded up on internet stock and the frenzy that a lot of people lost a lot of money. 
[00:23:30]  But yeah, the economy itself wasn't this bad.  This is, this is the worst I've seen it.  And I can't even remember when, since I didn't pay attention to this crap.  Sure.  You know, I wasn't just, I wasn't involved.  I don't think we've ever seen it worse in our lifetimes.  This is pretty bad.  And it's across the board, my friends.  So yeah, everything is suffering.  Well, they said Starbucks profits were down 97%.  97%.  That's like, that's like, that's everybody that bought two cups of coffee only bought one. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  That is it.  I don't, I don't go to Starbucks as often anymore.  No.  Nah.  I love the culture there.  I have a lot of friends there.  It's fun.  Sometimes they put on a little hat with the green lady on it.  I just read your Starbucks chapter in your book.  I hate your guts, Jimmy.  Oh, well, wait a minute.  I thought you liked it.  Why would it be in it?  I love the coffee.  I give the employees quite a beating because they don't say thank you when you tip them.  Yeah.  He nailed it.  He just nailed it.  I mean, yeah.  These employees where you're doing the right thing. 
[00:24:30]  You make a lot more money than they do.  So you can afford to maybe, you know, a cup of coffee is $2.02.  That's because they want you to drop some change in their tip jar, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm doing well for myself.  So sure, I'll throw that $0.98 in the thing.  You nailed it with this chapter, Jimmy.  And these snobs don't even acknowledge that you just gave them pretty much a what?  What would a dollar tip basically be on $2?  I worked out the percentage.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  Whatever.  It was a huge percentage tip for nothing.  And they don't even acknowledge you did that.  I go, oh, my God.  I can relate to what Jimmy's writing in his book.  I just want to.  It's like you want to.  It's such a bizarre, snotty entitlement.  Like, and again, I don't think I'm leaving an endowment or a trip to Europe in the cup.  Hospital wing.  But how about just like, okay, thanks.  Thank you very much.  Next customer.  That's it.  It's like this common courtesy that I guess they consider beneath them.  But literally.  No, tips are now expected. 
[00:25:30]  Exactly.  That's the problem.  Because we tip wherever we go now.  I mean, change.  No one.  No, I shouldn't say no one.  But most people don't put the change in their pocket anymore.  There's tip jars everywhere.  You're like, ah, here you go.  Yeah.  And they expect that.  So they don't say thank you really fast.  And I, as I started writing this chapter, I was just attacking them for being rude.  I said, let me just, I noticed, I began to pay attention every time I went to a Starbucks.  Everywhere.  New York, LA.  I think one girl in LA might have said thank you.  And I counted maybe 14 or 15 times in a row that I left like money in the tip cup. 
[00:26:00]  Not even a thank you.  Like, just like, okay, next.  And it was just like, ugh.  Is it the way you're putting it in?  Like, here, ****.  Yes.  Yes.  Or I would give the two girls, I would say, here's one cup, and I would drop the change  in it and say, you know, lick it out.  Or you'd just heave the change at their faces.  Yeah.  Here!  Yeah, I'll throw it on the floor.  And I go, no, pick it up, scum.  Can't believe that'll thank me.  No, thank you. 
[00:26:30]  Why, I?  There's a tip jar at my pet food store.  That's Stump Brain.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, they're everywhere now.  The tip jar's everywhere now.  You're buying dog food, and there's a little jar at the register with a sign that says tips.  For what?  Yeah, I didn't tip.  For what?  For what?  Do you, I, I, I tried to write a joke about this, but it was just too juicy, and I fell  flat, of course.  When I was in, uh, I was in Santa Monica Boulevard in California, and I went into an adult bookstore,  and honestly, there was a tip jar on the counter. 
[00:27:00]  It was, I guess, if you had some pain, you threw it in.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was, of course, I was like, I have to try to joke about it, and then every joke  I did, I swung and missed until my back muscles were full.  Like, what are you going to leave in there?  And, uh, just that's a guy who deserves a tip.  What does he have to do?  Yeah.  I'm kind of mad at Jimmy, uh, this morning.  Why?  Because I was reading his book last night, I Hate Your Guts.  I sat down, and I read a nice chunk last night, a nice chunk, and he has a chapter 
[00:27:30]  on playing Little League, and, uh, the whole time I was rooting for the little fella, and  I thought the chapter was going to end with some nice, just some nice little tidbit, like  a solid line drive double to center field, something.  Yeah.  And, no, of course, it never came.  It was so depressing.  Aww.  It was so sad how awful he was in baseball, and continued to play year after year.  He thought he was a great pitcher one year, started one game, and what, they yanked you  after?  Ah, he sucked. 
[00:28:00]  They yanked you after the first 12 players made it to, made it on base or something.  It was like 6-0, and I had walked the bases around, and it was just humiliating.  But this was, oh, Jimmy.  This was because he was playing what's called right center field, where they put the kid  that's not that good, because, like Jimmy says in his book, I'm not going to do this  every day to you, Jimmy.  That's fine.  But basically, if you play this position, you have to guard, like, 10 feet.  Yeah.  Because the two real players, the one in center and the one in right, will cover everything  else. 
[00:28:30]  And I guess the coach, like, brought him in to do some relief pitching, and he lucked  out, and what?  You did very well?  I think maybe I mowed down one or two guys up there.  Feeling good.  Feeling good.  And so the coach decides that maybe this is what he could do, is pitch.  And the whole buildup of, he's going to pitch the next game, and he's practicing, and blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then the pressure got to him, and the first 12 guys made it up.  Just choked.  I was completely choked.  And he never pitched again.  It's like, I hate you, Jim Norton.  It never got mentioned, either. 
[00:29:00]  Like, nobody, it was like, it was like an episode.  I keep thinking of Nick Nolte and Prince of Tides, like, with the Brother Strong getting raped.  It was like, everybody just kind of kept under their hats.  Let's forget that day.  That's the beauty of, I guess, the beauty of you, because anyone else that would write  a chapter like that in a book, by the end of the chapter, they would give you a little  tidbit of hope, like, oh, the little fella did okay in the end.  Not Jim Norton, man.  Right to the end.  Right to the end.  Yeah, I mean, it's like, you got to, I think everybody relates to that, too, because most  people, like, play Little League or whatever, and it's like, we all kind of sucked on some 
[00:29:30]  level.  Most of us don't go on to play Major League Baseball.  Well, so I think we all kind of had that big moment, and you fouled it off your shin  bone, and that was the end of the game.  Yeah.  High hopes your father was there with his hat on with your team on it, and he had to take  you home and realize you're probably queer.  I just kind of wanted a happy ending for that chapter, and I never got it.  Yeah, I guess I didn't even realize that, but maybe it was kind of a bummy ending.  No, not at all.  No, what I'm saying is perfect.  It really is.  I hate your guts. 
[00:30:00]  Jim Norton, it's in bookstores now.  I'll be signing in Staten Island tomorrow and Rhode Island Thursday.  I'm going to Boston.  Ooh, the islands.  Yeah, I tour of the islands.  Tour of the islands.  Staten and Rhode.  That stinks.  I'm really fancy.  You're Al Sharpton chapter.  I was proud of you.  Oh, thank you.  Wow, you didn't hold back, huh?  No, no, not at all.  And we're throwing around like crazy, right?  Yeah, well, you better pick up the book and read it for yourself.  I don't throw it around like, you know, I'm a lunatic, but I mean, you know.  You make points. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, he's not worried that, you know, Sharpton's going to come after him.  No, for one, it's all true.  In literary form, you get a little more latitude.  He can be very silly.  Yes.  Very good.  Everybody knows.  And then I did the Starbucks chapter and a couple others.  877-212-ON-A.  You want to hear the dumbest voter ever?  Dumbest voter ever.  I know about 51% of the country.  Easy.  Wait for the miracles now, my friend.  Ah, is that what I'm waiting for?  Wait for the miracles.  All right, there's one miracle that I know won't come true. 
[00:31:00]  Let me think.  Whoa.  Wait for the miracles.  What?  We don't know what it is.  I think there's too much, you know.  Well, it would be the same miracle that a chameleon uses.  You ever see a chameleon, what they do for camouflage?  Oh.  You know.  I don't know.  Perhaps he can.  That would be a miracle.  All of a sudden, he comes out of the White House.  Hi, how you doing?  I'm like, oh, I like this guy now.  Man, if yesterday didn't prove to everybody that it's all BS in the end, I don't know 
[00:31:30]  what else to tell you.  Yeah.  Obama beat the crap out of Bush the entire election.  For the last two years, he's beaten him up.  Bush policy's got us into this, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He doesn't like the guy, and there they are all chummy chummy at the White House.  Well, oh, look at that.  Look, look.  Well, it's just all BS in the end.  They both understand the game.  Why can't they have a real moment?  What?  Oh.  No, that's not.  Just makes me laugh. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  But why can't they have a real moment?  They don't like each other?  Why are they making believe they did?  No, they really don't like each other.  Why are they making believe they do like each other yesterday?  I hate this crap.  It's all BS.  And then the two wives just sitting in that room, that let's just put the bitches in this room.  Yeah.  And Michelle Obama's very excited about the rooms for the children.  Mm-hmm.  Aw.  She's been hanging the paintings from good times.  The good times. 
[00:32:30]  Those JJ paintings.  Yeah.  Everyone's all tall and skinny and stuff.  You know there's some old school racists that work in that White House, and it's going  to be a very interesting transitional period.  I just want to see the big Afro woman naked pictures in Obama's room.  From The Shining?  From The Shining.  That's what I want to see.  And I didn't realize how tall that Michelle Obama.  She is a beast.  How tall is she?  I don't know.  You know, and she's probably wearing heels. 
[00:33:00]  Like, I'm with a taller woman that sometimes it gets close.  Sometimes she's close to being taller than me, and you've got to tell her, look, you can't  do the high heels.  She is wearing heels, I think.  I mean, for the big photo op at the White House, this Barack Obama should have said,  look, no freaking heels.  I've got to look strong here.  She's taller than George Bush.  She's 5'11".  She's way taller than George Bush.  But in these shoes, because George Bush isn't a short guy.  No.  No.  He's probably, what, 5'9", 5'10"?  No, I think he's 6'8". 
[00:33:30]  No, he's not 6'.  He is.  Is he really 6'8"?  He's deceptively taller than he comes off as.  But he's doing a high heel thing.  She's taller than everyone in this picture.  She's her own woman, because, you know, Brock should be able to go, look, this is going  to be a photo op, and, you know, I need to be the tallest person in the picture.  That's a whole power thing.  She needs implants.  Yeah.  She's got big, wide hips, a giant caboose, and no breasts to speak of. 
[00:34:00]  But she's got legs for days.  I'll be honest, I think she wears lousy clothes for her body.  I think, I'm telling you, I think, I like the fact that she has kind of a big hiney.  I like that.  It's very spankable.  Patrice O'Neal in studio today.  No, I really do.  I've always, I don't like it huge.  He likes Venus.  I don't like it that big.  But I think that she wears, like, that red, God, first designated shoe area talk, and  now the first lady's dress.  Yes, boy.  Quick, somebody dangle a hog in my face.  I'm hungry. 
[00:34:30]  Okay.  But, I mean, like, that awful thing she wore, like, the night he made his acceptance speech.  Yeah, the thing that looked like a Black Widow spider.  Yeah.  Yeah, she doesn't dress well to show her body off.  Not that you want to have a whore first lady, but you want to see a little bit of the shape.  Well, they'll figure it out, you know.  She said she's just going to be first mom.  That's what she's going to be.  And make cookies for the kids and everything like that.  Did you hear that they get $100,000 to redecorate the White House?  And I went through a little redesign when I bought my place here in Manhattan. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, you're not getting much for $100,000.  And that's a huge freaking building.  In D.C., though?  They're in a crappy neighborhood.  Yeah.  I mean, that's BS that they're throwing that at us.  It costs way more than $100,000 to rip up carpets and, you know, repaint everything and maybe get some furniture in there.  What do you think some pictures were doing in there?  They got to do all that.  Supposedly they rip up the carpets and all that crap when these people leave.  You heard the stories when Clinton left, right? 
[00:35:30]  They destroy the place.  Yeah.  The old administration just destroys the joint.  They make it very hard for the new administration.  Right?  Yeah.  Find some of those stories.  They rip out computers and they do all sorts of crap.  They took the W off of all the typewriters.  Off of all the computer keyboards.  Okay.  Why?  They took the W because George W.  I know, but why was it like a joke?  Because it was Clinton's people who were all a bunch of like, they were a little spoiled.  Like, we won, we won, and then when they had to leave, it was like, hey, you got eight years, it's over, now get the hell out. 
[00:36:00]  And they were doing, you know, little pranks and shenanigans, leaving things.  It's the White House.  Yeah.  Taking the W off computer.  That's good.  Taxpayers.  Yes.  Yeah.  An investigation.  W's we ought to buy.  I wonder where they bought all the W's.  Yeah.  Well, you may not believe this, but.  No?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Where did they get the W's?  Well, there was a store.  It was in D.C.  It didn't last very long.  Well, it was called Ted's Loose Computer Key Emporium. 
[00:36:30]  Emporium.  Yes.  Emporium.  You'd be surprised.  Do you know the semi-colon key is the bestseller?  I don't know why.  I am surprised.  The White House was trashed with 10 slice telephone lines, 100 inoperable computer keyboards.  Uh-huh.  The presidential seal had been ripped off the wall, and there was obscene graffiti in six  offices.  There you go.  So, yeah.  They don't mess around. 
[00:37:00]  What douches.  When the old administration leaves, they don't make it easy.  I don't see the Republican saw doing it like the Democrats did it?  No.  We'll see.  You know, Clinton had a bunch of guys that he came up with, you know?  And they just seemed very, very pissed that they were being thrown out.  All right.  There it is.  There's the picture of...  Yeah, we'll get that up on O&A Radio.  I love Scatman Carruthers' toes in that picture. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, I know.  And the fact he has his feet propped up on the smallest awful pillow ever.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  What's he watching?  I don't know.  Was he watching the news?  Yes, he was, actually.  Okay.  Was it the news?  Yeah.  They usually put Jeopardy! on the TV.  He should have stayed there.  In these older movies.  Hey, here's the dumbest voter ever right here.  So, Roger, can you tell me about your voting experience today?  Well, I went in, and I was going to vote for President Bush.  I was...  And I went in, and they told me I was... 
[00:38:00]  That he cannot serve a third term.  I was not aware.  And I just thought he's...  I didn't really like neither of the candidates,  so I just wanted to keep the same president since he's been around there.  And he seems like he's been doing an okay job, in my opinion.  So I was going to vote for him, but they said that you can't vote for me.  The president can't serve a third term.  So I went ahead and cast a blank ballot. 
[00:38:30]  Why is he allowed to vote?  I was going to say, I really believe you need to, like, just answer three or four questions  before they allow you to vote.  Just real basic stuff.  A lot of times you have to answer even a couple of questions for anything.  For anything.  For anything.  It's scary.  Except for, like, voting and having children.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For some reason, those important things, you just do them at will.  Two of the most important things.  Ah!  No real test needed.  He's going to vote for Bush.  Yeah.  He did not know, though. 
[00:39:00]  You can't vote for him.  Didn't know.  For the, uh...  I guess he didn't know.  All right.  Quick break.  On the way, we got Jim Florentine stopping by.  Yep.  We have reports on pubic fashion coming in.  What?  And we have a new method of ingesting alcohol.  All right.  We're always looking for new ways, right?  Is this new?  This is new, new.  It's not that old, new.  Like what?  What do you got?  That vapor mist thing.  We're in vapor mist.  Okay. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  This is new.  Newer than that.  All right.  Shoot it right up.  Was there a time people were trying it with like some kind of like, uh...  It was an enema?  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  Wine enema.  That's not very social.  Yeah.  I don't see how you...  It was you.  You know.  Someone over the house, hey.  Great date in Germany.  And after dinner drink, after the goose and duck soiree.  Jimmy, let's put signs up in our neighborhood that we're having a wine enema party.  Yeah.  And we'll just invite the neighborhood. 
[00:40:00]  Just to see who shows up.  Just to see who shows up.  Good stuff.  We come to the door, we go, oh, goody, goody.  Creeps.  A wine enema party.  Hello, I'm here for the party.  I'm here for the wine enema party.  Ugh.  All right.  And some other things.  Yeah, some good phone calls coming in as well.  877-212-ONA.  You got that right.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:40:30]  What's up, peeps?  Wow, this is nice 7 a.m. music.  Hopi and Anthony.  Someone's alarm just went off and they went into shock.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Tough times for everyone, Ant.  Tough times for everyone.  Ah, tough times.  We'll be here until they tell us you don't have to be here anymore.  That the times are better?  That's how we look at it.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I'm an optimist.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I think the times will get better. 
[00:41:00]  Ah!  Damn.  877-212-ONA.  Jim Florentine will be here in about a half hour.  Yes.  Right.  Our old friend, by the way.  Yeah, I loved Martin.  He was one of our guys from the beginning.  And we just didn't have room for the little fella.  And we were bummed.  And then he moved on to Howard's show for a long time.  But he was always friends with us, no matter what. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, Jim's never had a negative word to say.  No, he's a real dude.  Not about us.  No.  About other people.  He's a real dude.  I heard him.  He was on Eddie Trunk's show last night.  He's a funny guy, man.  Yeah, he really is.  He just really makes me laugh.  And you guys are very old friends.  I mean, you guys roomed together and everything.  Gay lovers.  Gay lovers.  Never gay lovers.  Although I did.  Let's just say I had a girl on one bed and he had one on the other.  And I watched him work it.  And I was dressed in all black.  And whatever was supposed to be working on me wasn't. 
[00:42:00]  Picture this.  You're supposed to go hopscotching.  And your right leg is limp.  Like a noodle.  Right.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't hopscotch.  That's got to suck.  That was horrendous for her.  All right.  Hey, we got a new method of ingesting alcohol.  Yeah.  I want to know what this is.  I'm thinking maybe we should say this one for Florentine.  It's a good one.  Oh, yeah.  But we have something.  Why?  What's the problem?  Sorry.  I'm looking at Florentine.  It's a good Florentine. 
[00:42:30]  But we have something else we want to throw at everybody because we love these stories  as well.  Yep.  So we're not.  We talk about the perv switch.  You want to explain the perv switch?  Oh, the perv switch.  Usually dentists succumb to the perv switch a lot.  But we all have it.  Yeah.  Everyone's got the perv switch.  But we understand that it's there and we control ourselves.  You're walking down the street and you just see a woman, if you're a guy, obviously. 
[00:43:00]  I won't talk about it the other way.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't think girls think the same way anyway.  Like, oh, he looks like he'd be a nice provider.  Yeah.  Shut up.  So you see just the hottest girl walking down the street and you can't help but turn  around and look.  I don't care who you're with or anything.  You got to look and just kind of go, oh, my God.  And you lose it for a little bit.  Holy Jesus.  That is stunning.  Yeah.  And then you go about your business.  Right.  But you definitely have that feeling like, ah, I'll ruin everything for this one. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  You just get like maybe a fantasy or two will run through your head really quickly.  Yeah.  Things like that.  And then it just goes away.  Thank God.  Yeah.  It goes away because you have a breaker.  Yeah.  It's like a breaker, but the breaker's in your house.  Yeah.  If they get overloaded, what happens?  You trip a breaker.  All the lights go off.  You're all confused and disoriented.  But then there's guys, they have a penny in that breaker preventing the breaker switch  from doing its job. 
[00:44:00]  It's going to start a fire.  It's jam.  That's going to burn your whole house down.  Oh, boy.  And it's going to destroy everything you know and love.  Boy, and it does.  So the perv switch is this thing that, you know, you don't really want it to ever go  off, but let's say you're a dentist and a girl's in the chair and she's very attractive  and now she's under anesthetic and you get like, ah, her blouse is flimsily buttoned.  And a lot of times these guys just can't take it in the middle of their dentistry.  The buttons are struggling to do their job. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Just trying to hold everything back.  That button wants to pop across the room.  And he's going about his dentistry work and then he looks down and the perv switch just  snaps.  And he goes from family man, dentist, all those years of schooling, everything, to finding  himself both hands firmly planted where they shouldn't be and giving a vigorous massage.  Locking the door.  People are knocking on the outside of the door wondering what the hell's going on. 
[00:45:00]  Now he's a felon in two seconds.  A flip of this perv switch, he couldn't take it, is what happened.  He got to the point where it was like, oh my God, this is so hot.  But he went from fantasy to I need, I need to touch those.  Yeah.  Click.  And then he does it and ends up throwing his whole career, his life, his wife, his kids,  everything gone.  And he always ruins it because he can't put the girl back together the right way.  No, you can never put Humpty back together again.  Something will always be a little askew. 
[00:45:30]  If someone took your pants off and put them back on, your pockets would be a little weird.  You know, you got to put your hands in your pockets to straighten them out.  The zipper is a little too far off to the right or something.  It's a little twisted to the side and you're like, why is the crotch of my pants over on  my thigh a little too much?  My cuff is twisted.  I guess when you put your own clothes on, you know you put your clothes on.  But...  The boob isn't evenly distributed.  No, no, the bra.  Girls do tricks with that bra where they pull the boob up and then tuck it back in, kind 
[00:46:00]  of.  It's like that move and you don't know how to do that.  And then if they really have the perv switch done and had cleaning up to do, now you're  just in trouble.  With the dental assistant knocking at the door with the x-rays.  Doctor?  I got the x-rays.  Doctor, I have the x-rays.  Is everything okay?  Yeah.  One minute, nurse.  I'm in so much trouble.  Why did I do that?  It's another one of my favorite scenarios.  There's evidence going down the rinse sink. 
[00:46:30]  The anesthesia is wearing off.  You're trying to clean up.  She's knocking on the door with the x-rays.  She's coming to.  You punch her in the face and tell the bruising was from a root canal that you did impromptu.  Yeah, she's like...  And you had the blouses still half open.  You got to just clock her.  There'll be some slight bruising on your cheek from where I did the cleaning.  Your cell phone's ringing because your little fella did well at school and your wife wants  to tell you about it.  Oh, that's great.  Just everything is happening at one moment.  That's great, honey.  Doctor? 
[00:47:00]  Doctor!  That goddamn perf switch him off.  Well, we got one of those stories is what we're getting at.  Yeah.  These are our favorite stories.  This guy probably time and time again just did this every day, no problem.  He did his job.  Yeah.  And then this girl walked in and he just lost his mind.  And you're going to hear a lot of laughter because we can't help ourselves.  We love these stories.  Of course we do.  We're bad people.  Your favorite morning show is filled with bad people.  Horrible, despicable humans.  Here's the latest perf switch story.  A local jeweler is behind bars accused of sexually assaulting a young customer. 
[00:47:30]  Now, a jeweler.  We understand the dentist thing.  How do you do that?  We understand the doctor's visit thing.  She's fully conscious.  I mean, nothing.  Just going off with nothing.  We understand the young gynecologist that gets the 17-year-old every once in a while  in there for a first exam.  They don't know where the work ends and the pleasure begins with a gyno visit. 
[00:48:00]  What girl is going to know, you know, all right, no, I have to do this.  This is a new test we're doing.  It's connected this way.  It has to be done.  Those guys must be great poker players, man.  Oh, yeah.  Because like you said, you don't know where the work ends and the pleasure begins.  Who knows?  You don't know what hand the doctor has.  Hi, it's my first visit.  Does he have pocket aces?  Does he have an awful lot, you know?  I'm a little scared.  Right.  Well, lay down here. 
[00:48:30]  I'm a gynecologist.  I'm a gynecologist.  So you've never been to the gynecologist before.  You have no idea what this entails.  No.  All right.  Let's get to work.  Shall we?  This is done completely nude on both of our parts.  Don't you put gloves on?  No, not needed.  Gloves schmoves.  It's Christmas every day in my office.  You can tell me, how does the voice change when he really gets into the examination? 
[00:49:00]  What?  Like when he's...  Oh, yes.  I have to do a certain test on you.  That is a new type of procedure.  And it's one of my own.  So please try to keep it very secret.  This test goes on for a while.  So don't worry.  All right.  Roll over.  That's funny. 
[00:49:30]  You're young enough for the roll over.  Yes, of course.  You have to check everything.  Make sure you're okay.  Sure do.  I had one girl tell me.  I used to work with her at Pergament.  Ugh.  That terg...  I know.  It was awful.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay.  We've all had awful jobs.  Yeah.  Pergament.  Ugh.  She was telling me that her gyno would actually be inappropriate at times.  She said she knew he was a little inappropriate when he complimented her panties.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  That is a little inappropriate.  These panties are nice.  That shouldn't be done.  That's a guy that wants to go from inappropriate to dating.  Well, this went on...  She said...  Just be inappropriate with the poker face.  Yeah.  You'll have a nice career.  This is what I do.  She said that he would, let's just say, probably during the course of an examination would cause  her to have feelings that she wasn't supposed to be having during an examination.  Because, let's be honest, the guy who's an expert...  Oh, yeah.  He's the master of that area. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  And he would...  Yeah.  She said talking softly to her.  Yeah.  Many years ago, she told me that.  That's really hot.  I made her tell me while I just angrily caused a problem all over my steering wheel.  All right.  Let's get to Perf's Witch Story.  So, it's a jeweler.  This isn't...  Yeah.  How are you faking this one?  Usually, the pinnacle of the community is the jeweler.  Yes.  But, it's very obvious in every one of these stories where the Perf's Witch gets turned 
[00:51:00]  on.  Beep.  Listen for it.  A local jeweler is behind bars accused of sexually assaulting a young customer.  Investigators say there could be more victims.  This is 56-year-old Fairy Doon Gavami.  He's now in jail.  This.  Yeah.  This.  Fairy Doon Gavami.  Wow.  His name?  This.  Fairy Doon Gavami.  He's now in jail.  Arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a customer at his jewelry store in Laguna Hills. 
[00:51:30]  Investigators say it happened Friday when an 18-year-old customer wanted to buy a necklace  for her mother.  As she was trying the necklaces on, he reached down, inappropriately touched her on the breast.  He then stuck his hand in her pants and inappropriately touched her.  Wow.  This guy just lost everything.  That is losing his mind.  The Perf switch goes off and it's over, Johnny.  He's showing her a necklace.  He probably went to put it on her. 
[00:52:00]  She must have those.  Could you put it on me?  So she turns around and he's just looking at her hips and ass and putting the necklace  on so he's brushing against her shoulders maybe a little bit.  No, no, no.  To put the necklace on properly, she probably had to lean over the counter a little bit.  Oh, you're thinking the frontwards.  Showing the heaviness of her youthfulness.  So she leans over the counter.  And if you're trying a necklace, you've got to have some area to show off the necklace.  So you've got the cleavage working.  Nice fat seats. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, man.  He's probably putting the necklace around her and he's smelling her hair and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  He's real close.  Can't seem to get the clasp.  Oh, I've got to touch those.  Just grabs on her.  What are you doing?  Slides his hand down.  In one, one split second, he wrecks everything in his life.  He goes from just, I'm just going to be here today.  Looking at the clock, going, what customers are going to be in today?  Straighten up some of the jewelry. 
[00:53:00]  Maybe I'll dust off the case.  Oh, this is an attractive young girl walking in.  Wow, that's some set of breasts on her.  Could you help me with the clasp?  No, I've got to feel those.  It probably went nasty real quick.  Like, he's got his tongue between his teeth as he's putting his hand down her pants.  And she's like, stop it.  He's just going, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  I've got to.  Because everybody, I think, has had that.  You ever have the, especially, well, obviously in the summer, when girls are wearing little shorts. 
[00:53:30]  And their bellies are showing.  And you look, and a lot of times the shorts are pulled down pretty low.  And you go, I could just take my hand right now.  Right now.  And just shove it right down the front of those shorts.  Yep.  Just do it.  And you almost know how that would feel.  Because you're looking.  So you've got the sight sensation.  You have the familiarity in your head knowing what that feels like just from experience. 
[00:54:00]  And you're just like, I could do that.  I'll be arrested.  But that's the point we're making.  But your perv switch stays on the off position.  Yeah, the fantasy's in your head.  Yes.  And that's where it stops.  Not with this guy.  Yeah.  This guy lost it.  But I don't like pearls.  You better.  Get a necklace.  Here comes the necklace.  I was speaking code.  I like to let the listeners figure out the rest of the show.  Oh, no. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Here's more of the story with the perv switch going off.  We touched her.  Investigator said it was all caught on videotape.  We could see where surveillance came.  And there's surveillance video.  This girl must be really hot.  She's just crazy.  I haven't seen it.  She's like one of the sirens that sing your ships into the box.  She's just irresistible.  Yeah.  All caught on videotape, we could see where a surveillance camera was apparently removed.  The Royal Fine Jewelry Store was closed today.  But we also found some information about the store on this website. 
[00:55:00]  The suspect calls himself Fred the Friendly Jeweler.  Those who know him aren't sure what to call him now.  Well, we can come up with a few names that you like.  It's hilarious.  Yes.  Fred the Friendly Jeweler.  Fred the Friendly Jeweler.  The A Little Too Friendly Jeweler.  Yes.  That's good.  Smell my fingers, Freddy.  He was just kind of trying to size himself for a ring.  I'm trying to see what...  Let me see. 
[00:55:30]  You're 18.  Right?  I guess I'm about a...  Oh, a pinky ring.  A pinky ring.  For the 10 years they've been trying to size themselves for a watch.  That is the second part to the story.  He's friendly.  Orange County Sheriff's investigators say this might not be the first incident, so they're  asking anyone with more information or who believes they're a victim to call them.  Sometimes when things happen like this, young females are afraid or embarrassed to come 
[00:56:00]  forward.  And the owner of this store now faces some very serious charges of sexual assault and  sexual battery.  If convicted, he faces up to eight years in prison.  Eight years.  Is that?  He had a business.  Eight years.  You do four.  Is it worth it?  Just threw it all away.  I'm really, like, considering that.  Is that worth it?  Four years?  Let me see.  No.  Not really.  For a sex crime?  Well, that could be rough.  She's 18, though.  It's not like she's a kid, but, I mean, it's still crazy.  It's awful, but... 
[00:56:30]  Well, you're blaming the victim, Jack.  Yes!  What are the jewelry in the mail like every other good girl?  Dirty, dirty girl.  He's just Fred the Friendly Jeweler.  Of course, yes.  She knew what she was getting into when she went in.  Ted the Friendly Jeweler.  That's right.  Here you are.  Here's your necklace, madam.  Ted just throws the box at her.  Put this on.  I don't want to go to your bosoms.  I may scrape them with my knuckles.  Wow.  The guy went all in, too, man.  Yeah.  He just screwed everything up. 
[00:57:00]  He screwed everything up.  All right.  Fred the Friendly Cellmate.  You know, we had this story yesterday, before we take a break and get Jim Florentine in here,  and talk about how people are using a new method to ingest alcohol.  This one is...  Yes.  No one's going to guess this, unless you've been online and you saw it for yourself.  No.  We had this story yesterday. 
[00:57:30]  We were too busy, and now they're talking about it in the papers today.  But Joe Scarborough, you know, MSNBC...  Yep.  ...who fired Imus for that famous incident.  Well, he has a potty mouth.  Does he?  And Ronnie B said it yesterday.  If we got an F word out there on the airwaves, we'd be fired.  Simple as that.  We just would.  F equals fired on the radio.  Even if we slip and we didn't mean to, like, I guess Joe Scarborough did. 
[00:58:00]  You could go to your boss.  You could apologize.  You could apologize to the listeners.  You can try to plead your case that it was a mistake.  It was this, that, the other thing.  For some reason, you'll be fired.  TV, lately especially, that F word's been flying around on television.  Yeah.  With, you know, nary a complaint.  No one really seems to care, which is good.  I mean, people have worse things.  This is one thing good about a bad economy.  People got a lot more important things to worry about.  You know, when everything was hunky-dory, 
[00:58:30]  and people were buying houses and cars and gas was cheap,  they had to find something to bitch about.  So it was, oh, inappropriate radio and political correctness.  Now, you know, you don't see people marching as much  and protesting and complaining about things.  During these, they're being thrown out of their friggin' houses.  During these tough times, I want my local anchorman  to be able to sprinkle a few words in for us.  Oh, a few saucy words.  Oh, absolutely.  The F word.  Holy S, we're screwed. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, something good.  Just a little sprinkle.  I wouldn't be a fan of allowing the F word every other word on TV,  but I would like to see it sprinkled in.  Because we all sprinkle these words in.  A little more than a sprinkle.  Well, yeah.  I'm being polite, but I mean,  the average person sprinkles these words around,  so why not have them on TV?  I notice I use them in meetings a lot.  Really?  You ever notice that?  I use the F word in meetings all the time.  Yeah.  Because you have that little naughty boy thing. 
[00:59:30]  You're saying it in front of the adults.  Anthony is still a little Anthony.  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  I'm trying to make a point,  and I'm just using the F word all the time.  We don't take meetings anymore.  No, screw it.  We know what all you guys are about,  and we don't need meetings anymore.  Yeah.  We know you're full of lies,  and we're not going to listen to the crap anymore.  Text me so I can delete it.  Right.  We'll give you a very good radio show every morning  to the best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day. 
[01:00:00]  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities or a good show?  Come on.  That is a good point.  The best of our abilities falls fine short.  We've got to make a choice here, guys.  We've bumped our heads on mediocrity and stopped.  We will give you a fine radio show every day.  No more meetings, though,  because you're all just be-essers out there.  How about this?  We'll give you something that is more pleasant  than cancer surgery every morning.  That I could guarantee.  A whole big bunch better than cancer surgery. 
[01:00:30]  We've been at this way too long.  We know what you're about.  We can't buy into your lies anymore,  but we will do a very good radio show every single day.  But no more meetings.  We're holding up our side.  That's right.  So Scarborough did this yesterday.  Decent, steady men that don't go around  flipping people off or screaming  **** you at the top of their lungs.  I suggest that you miss the Jay Carney story.  That was the Jay Carney story.  I didn't use the word. 
[01:01:00]  Honey.  So Mike Barnicle.  Yes, sir.  The beauty of it, obviously,  he had no idea that he said it.  Because when you're acting like it,  Joe Scarborough seems like he's a bit real  and just kind of being himself.  Yeah.  And, you know, when you use the word,  half the time you don't even realize you're using it.  You're being a real human being.  When they dump out of it on us occasionally,  it's usually just,  we have no idea you even said it. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  That's just like,  because you're talking and then it slips out  because it's part of general conversation usually.  Right.  And then you go,  oh my, did I say that?  He had no clue.  That's why the woman,  the whole is like,  uh, um, uh,  I don't know.  No?  I met Joe.  I went over to MSNBC one day  and did a little something,  something that didn't really work.  And, uh,  he was the coolest guy behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Very, very different.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Why didn't it work?  Was it, uh,  well, it did work,  but the stuff that,  ah, whatever.  I, I, I,  whatever.  We taped some really funny stuff,  but it's MSNBC,  so you gotta not be edgy.  Of course.  Joe realizes he said the F word  and apologizes.  Well, it's interesting you say that.  I think.  Hold on, let me call a timeout.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yes.  No, you meant to say the letter.  I did not say what you said.  Come to mommy right here.  You meant to say.  I may be the one on Ambien.  If I actually said the word instead, 
[01:02:30]  did I say the word?  You almost did.  You meant to say the letter,  but we should clarify and apologize  if everyone heard it that way.  Why is she speaking?  Shut up, bitch.  Let him, uh, you know.  We should apologize.  Ugh.  Stupid codependent woman,  let him get it out.  Time for the fake apology.  No one's offended by hearing the F word.  I'm sorry.  And the people that are  aren't worth the time of day.  You did say it.  I heard it.  You're awful.  You meant to say the letter.  What are you, my mommy? 
[01:03:00]  Shut up.  You guys want to get the little F-ers  on the show today, Kirsten?  I love when they do that.  The little F-ers out there.  It's adorable.  I love when the little F-ers call our show  with their opinions.  They're terrific.  Yeah.  A letter,  but we should clarify and apologize  if everyone heard it that way.  The letter.  Jay Carney had told the story earlier  about a conversation.  He didn't use the word,  but it was all fair.  Holy cow.  Jesus.  God almighty.  Shut up.  Let the guy talk.  Another hole.  He said it.  He's explaining himself. 
[01:03:30]  I love over-explaining.  It's like a mother in the office  with the principal.  It's like, don't talk.  No, he was a good boy.  He wasn't involved in that.  It was the other boys that did this thing.  Shut up.  Oof.  That's irritating.  Isn't it?  Let him say what he's got to say.  He's a man.  It'd be great if he turned around  and told her to shut the F up.  Yeah, and then back slapped her.  Left his ring print in her cheek.  I love broads,  but not on the radio  and not on TV.  Absolutely.  Just in the kitchen  and the bedroom. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I'm like James Evans.  Yeah.  James.  There's an exception  to the rule here and there,  but for the most part,  ugh,  they're the same person.  Yep.  The same holy hole.  He told the story earlier  about a conversation.  He didn't use the word,  but it was all fair.  Yeah.  Fine.  Okay.  Let's move on.  So I repeated,  so great apologies  if I said the word  instead of the letter.  It was a mix.  My wife is going to kill me  when I get home.  We are so sorry.  I hate this woman.  I'm so sorry. 
[01:04:30]  Great apologies.  I'm going to text her right now.  Are you?  Who is she?  Why doesn't she shut up?  Are you,  Miss Goody Two Shoes?  You're going to text his wife  right now?  Ugh.  Who is that broad?  Shut up.  Oh my God.  Her endless prattling  is maddening.  Just a prattling hen.  Shut up.  She's so afraid  of losing her gig.  Quiet.  This is why it took me  so long  to find the right one  because the world  is filled  with those. 
[01:05:00]  The man is saying,  oh yeah,  he's relaying  what happened  and going,  he's sorry,  and she just  has to continually  try and fix it.  Oh,  she's going to be mad.  I'll text her right now.  I'll text her.  Thanks.  Don't worry,  I've emasculated  your husband.  Yeah,  thanks.  Good one.  I'm trying to fix it.  Fix,  fix,  fix,  fix,  fix,  fix.  Ugh.  Ugh.  She should be that eager  when someone finds  a stain in the bowl 
[01:05:30]  to grab that scrub brush.  Get that brush.  Right.  Oh,  I'll take care of this.  Steven S.  from Bayshore.  That hole needs to visit  Fred the Friendly Jeweler  for a good blanking.  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  Yes.  And the good blanking  is one of the F words,  but it's not the F word.  Nice.  You know,  it's...  Oh,  wow,  that other one.  It's the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one.  It would make  Bernard Hopkins proud.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I mean. 
[01:06:00]  Sure.  If you know what I mean.  Sure.  If you know what I mean.  All right.  Wow.  Florentine's here.  That's great that he just  thought he had said  the F...  Yeah,  no idea.  No idea.  He said the F-ing.  Which is awesome.  Gave the finger  and said the F-ing,  you know.  Mm-hmm.  And then he just...  The word came out.  Good for him.  I think her name is  who,  what?  Tim from Rochester,  the home of Brother Weez.  Weez is going to be back  on the radio shortly  and I couldn't be happier.  What's up, Tim?  Mika Brzezinski, 
[01:06:30]  I think the whole name is.  Okay.  From Rich.  Rich broad.  Okay.  Just constant.  Is she like that  every morning with Joe?  Every morning.  She stinks.  Why are you watching  that nonsense?  Because Joe,  I've taken a peek  at that show.  He does a pretty good job.  He's not bad.  I like the guy.  Don't need harder.  But they had to shove  the broad down his throat,  right?  To bounce it all out?  Tancy talk.  Name it bounce.  Tancy talk.  Yeah.  Tancy talk.  Tancy talk for a whore.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  Logan in Tennessee.  How's Oprah?  Logan, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was just  calling to basically  say goodbye, I guess.  This really sucks  because I only get you  guys on DirecTV.  Oh, boy.  And I heard you  leaving tomorrow  and it pisses me off.  I can't afford  anything else, you know?  Sir, look,  you have to make  sacrifices.  Do you have kids?  I'm 16, so... 
[01:07:30]  16.  All right, so what race  are you?  I am a mulatto, sir.  Yeah, we have a pretty  big audience that  follows us on DirecTV  and that's going away  tomorrow, I guess.  And we found out  through our listeners,  which makes us very happy.  I don't know what to  tell you, Logan.  I'm sorry.  A decision was made  by...  By...  Serious?  The powers that be.  Yeah, exactly.  That.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  It sucks, man.  I mean, you guys were  just talking yesterday 
[01:08:00]  about how, you know,  the government, you know,  companies, whatever,  they just screw us over  on these things  we don't fight back on  and I'm thinking,  like, I mean,  just, okay,  subtly, if you can,  like later in the show,  tell us what buildings  to burn down  to bring this back,  you know?  Because it's really,  it's really bothering me.  Well, I...  The pyramids.  I wish they would have  told us ahead of time  because I would have  gave my opinion  on the whole thing.  DirecTV carried our show  and I guess the logic being 
[01:08:30]  if you get rid of  the DirecTV,  then these guys  will go out  and buy XM units  but the problem is  a lot of these people  already have XM units  and they use the DirecTV  to listen in the house  before they go in their car.  Right.  So this is something  that I hope they thought  thoroughly about.  I mean,  with the economy,  the way it is,  you know,  I certainly can't afford it.  I mean,  I don't know about  a lot of people  I don't have XM.  We know our listeners  pretty well.  A lot of them  cannot afford another unit  so they could, you know, 
[01:09:00]  follow the show  in their houses  and this was a great  thing for these people  or check out the show  while they're getting  ready for work  then they jump in their car  and they got the XM unit  and boom!  They're very happy customers  but now,  I don't know,  I feel like it's going to,  you know,  we're going to lose  a lot of our audience.  Simple as that.  I mean,  I've only been listening  for like a year  and since like last August  or something  but I've...  What's going on?  Endless.  All right.  God,  was he a babbling fool. 
[01:09:30]  You get it,  you love us.  Yeah,  rob your local,  like,  liquor store  so you get the money  to whatever it takes  to, you know,  to continue being a super fan.  16,  you don't have an XM.  What kind of punk are you?  Yeah,  stop it.  That's a 16-year-old?  Yeah,  he did say that,  right?  Wow.  All right,  Opie and Anthony,  Florentine next.  Yep.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  To my right,  it's about effing time. 
[01:10:00]  Jim Florentine in studio.  Yeah.  We've only been trying  to do this for,  I don't know,  10 years.  10 years?  Yeah.  I've been busy.  Yeah.  Just stupid.  Like,  you got two shows that...  Yes.  over the years  didn't really get along,  but the people  that are involved  with those shows  always got along.  You know,  we've always been  friends with Jim Florentine.  Used to live with Norton  for many, many years.  These guys are solid friends.  So,  now you get to do our show. 
[01:10:30]  It was a little weird,  you know,  because, you know,  Jim was on your show,  I was on Howard's show,  and we were living together.  Yeah.  And Jim got the sidekick job,  and I was a regular on there,  and it was like,  there was some,  you know,  stuff going on  between the two shows,  and we're just looking at each other  like,  I don't know.  I'm not getting involved.  It sounds like a sitcom pick.  It really was.  He's on one show.  But we never brought it home  to each other.  Yeah.  We were respectful like that.  We didn't hold it against each other.  Yeah,  when you guys were pulling trains  and stuff,  it never came up in conversation.  Yeah.  And when Jim was pushing my cheeks,  we never brought that up. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah,  that's going to be a tough spot  for you guys to be in.  Well,  not really.  Knowing that all that crap  was going on,  and you guys are,  you know.  It was a little weird.  On opposite shows.  Yeah,  but I didn't really,  you know,  we didn't really know  what was going on.  I guess that stuff was before,  you know,  but we're both on each other.  But we never brought it up  when I would see you,  you know,  at the comedy clubs and stuff.  You were just always  a good dude, man.  Really funny dude.  No,  look,  you know,  you guys took a like in the gym,  so Jim's like,  you know what,  I got a good home here,  and then, 
[01:11:30]  you know,  they took a like in me over there,  and I'm like,  I don't know what's going on  in the background,  but I'm cool here for a while,  and we'll see what happens.  And then look,  now we're one big happy family.  Right.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Took a long time.  And because of you,  I met Robin,  and she could have been nicer,  and I know you guys  don't go out anymore,  so maybe I shouldn't be  bringing this up,  but she was very cool.  It should be stated today.  No,  absolutely.  And then,  yeah,  we met Anthony too.  Yes,  yes,  and well,  Anthony and my relationship  at the time.  Who would have thought? 
[01:12:00]  You know,  we were both in relationships.  It would have been over  pretty soon for both of us.  Yeah,  who knew?  We seemed so happy at the time.  I know,  it was pictures of us  all smiling.  Yes.  We're all on our honeymoon,  and we're in the Bahamas.  Yeah,  that's what it was like.  And then,  wow,  came apart at the seams.  You are a brave man,  though,  because you started dating Robin,  and I'm thinking to myself,  wow,  if this relationship goes bad,  he's blowing up his spot  with Howard.  Yeah,  I mean,  you know,  look,  there was risk,  but I didn't care,  man. 
[01:12:30]  It was like,  she was cool.  I asked her out on the air  as a goof.  I didn't think she was going to say yes.  I've never had the balls  to do it off the air.  Yeah.  There's no way.  And she's like,  all right,  fine,  I'll go to dinner with you.  We were both single at the time,  and,  you know,  we hung for a few months before,  you know,  we're friends and stuff like that,  just feeling out.  She knew about my reputation.  I told all the stories on the show.  You know,  she's like,  what am I doing with this guy?  She's like,  come on.  And I'm like,  look,  that's just the way I am.  And I'm like,  that's why I was like,  there's no way I could.  Like,  if I thought,  if I asked her off the air, 
[01:13:00]  I would get banned from the show  because it would be so,  I would put her on the spot.  Like,  are you kidding me?  I'd never go out with you.  Sure.  You know,  it was cool.  She's really cool.  Yeah,  I can't say anything bad about her anymore.  No,  you know what it was?  She was very,  very cool.  You know,  when you're used to these little girls,  there's just so much drama  and just so much crap with it,  even though,  you know,  I just needed someone at that time  to just,  you know,  be a really cool chick,  bring no drama to the table,  and that's what it was.  So you're back to the little girls?  Of course.  You know,  you miss them.  I miss getting texts 
[01:13:30]  175 times a day.  The terrible twos are fun,  aren't they?  Yeah.  I miss dropping her off,  and a minute later,  I get a text,  where you at?  I'm like,  I'm still in the driveway,  all right?  I didn't even pull out yet.  Yeah,  well,  there's definitely  a price to pay  for an ass like a snare drum.  I know.  Hey,  you have a Norton story  that we haven't heard yet?  Because you guys live together. 
[01:14:00]  I want to hear  a good Norton story today.  I don't know.  Because he's got some dirt on it.  How descriptive?  Because you can't really  touch it.  Well,  obviously,  something Norton would be okay with.  I'm not trying to,  Oh,  no.  Come on.  What could be out there  that hasn't been said about him?  That's true.  That's the day the girl  was faithful.  Keep it under your hat.  That's horrid.  Well,  I just know,  like,  you know,  he kept different hours than me.  I would go to bed  at like two or three.  Jim would go to bed  at like nine in the morning.  So I'd have to get him up  at like 7 p.m.  because not to miss  his first spot. 
[01:14:30]  He's like,  can you get me up at seven?  I'm like,  in the morning?  He goes,  no,  at night.  Oh,  my God.  Dude,  you got to get your life together.  By the time I got up,  Starbucks was closed.  He was angry.  So,  you know,  I go to bed at like three  and the kitchen table  was right near my bedroom.  So this guy would get in  at like six in the morning  and just start eating potato chips  like a maniac.  Oh,  yeah.  I'm trying to sleep.  My head's like a foot away from him  and I'm like,  what is it?  Is there a chipmunk in the kitchen?  I'm pounding on the wall.  He's like,  sorry,  dude,  sorry,  dude,  I was just hungry.  I'm starving.  You know how it is.  I haven't eaten all day.  I'm like,  all right, 
[01:15:00]  just go to,  go in the other room.  There was an Exxon  and I would stop at the Exxon  and go to the subway  and I thought I was eating healthy  because I was eating subway.  I would eat two subway sandwiches  and then go to bed  on Artie,  what was,  oh God,  Artie,  not Artie Lang.  Artie Fletcher.  Artie Fletcher's old bed.  Yeah,  you know Artie Fletcher?  No.  He's obese.  Having somebody else's bed is just.  Yeah,  I bought his bed for 200 bucks  and he lies a lot.  He's like,  ah,  it's brand new.  I'm like,  there's like coffee stains on it.  I'm like,  this isn't brand new.  Is it coffee?  Yeah,  and that guy never wore a bag either,  so. 
[01:15:30]  It wasn't the first time  Jim was laying in someone else's bed.  Oh,  yeah.  Sure.  Well,  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  That was fun.  Jesus Christ.  You really were bad back then.  Oh,  I was so,  I was so well behaved  on my,  like the first,  you know,  I moved in with Jim  and I was like,  I was 30  and it was time to get out  of my parents' house  and I was so well behaved  and I was quiet for a while  and then,  you know,  fast forward a month,  I'm smoking in the living room,  his girlfriend hates me.  We did Cribs with your,  your old place  that you guys lived in together. 
[01:16:00]  Oh,  with the mold and everything.  The Cribs was a popular show.  We did a few episodes ourselves  and we did a Norton Cribs  and you were living with him  at the time.  I thought I lived in some S-holes  but that place,  wow.  It was brutal.  With the black mold  where you guys,  what,  you framed pictures  to cover up the black mold?  Yeah,  I went to the English Channel auction  in New Jersey  for like four bucks  and bought these pictures  that would cover a mold.  We put tinfoil on the wall  to cover the mold.  His bedroom was lined  with tinfoil.  It was so,  it looked like he was  trying to be fashionable  but he was just 
[01:16:30]  trying to stay alive.  It looked like aliens  where he was keeping  the alien signals away.  But you know,  we paid,  it was like 800 bucks,  a two bedroom  for 800 bucks.  Nice, right.  And I had my girlfriend  living there  so it was three of us  splitting 800 bucks.  Sweet.  We couldn't beat him.  We needed to be in New York  because we were trying  to get into the clubs  and all that stuff.  Didn't they try to like,  didn't they make that  Section 8 housing  or something like that?  Like it went into  some weird like government housing  after we left  because the landlord  lived below us.  Yeah, yeah,  they did something with it.  It was really,  it was a dump.  Great.  He probably had to do that  in order to refurbish it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  That was just moldy.  Did you guys have bugs  and other creatures?  Silverfish?  Yeah,  we had some silverfish,  yeah.  Oh,  those things,  I had those,  those things.  And then all of a sudden  this passed.  I'd rather see a cockroach  than those things  for some reason.  They just say filth.  Yeah.  And moisture.  I know,  yeah.  And then this new landlord  took over,  a Spanish dude,  and within three days  we had roaches.  Did we have roaches?  Yeah.  Well,  no,  you were just moving out  at the time,  yeah.  Oh,  okay,  I probably just missed that.  I probably missed the,  because the silverfish 
[01:17:30]  I never had roaches.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Isn't that nice?  Now look at you,  living in the lap of luxury.  Yeah,  I know,  now he's in Trump Tower.  Yeah.  Well,  now he's got like a shoe area.  He was talking about this morning.  It's a designated shoe area.  You know how it is,  you have to have a gentleman  that has to have a place  to keep his shoes.  And I'd like to meet a girl  by there.  And he's bragging about  his California closets.  Like,  what happened to us?  What,  I have to have a nice place  to put stuff?  You used to live  with black mold.  Yeah,  I know.  We had a living room  with a silverfish.  It had like that old door  where it had that big keyhole. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  So that's where we'd always  bring chicks  and we'd watch each other  through the little keyhole.  He's like psycho.  But it was fun,  because Jim always has to pee,  you know,  him,  every five seconds.  So every time I'm watching it,  I'm starting to be like,  wow,  this is getting good.  I gotta go pee  and I have to go run in my room.  And then if I wanted  to watch Florentine,  all I have to do  is walk into the kitchen,  these three chicks laid out  and I'm like,  Jesus Christ,  what a great life you have.  Amazing.  There's a picture  of the silverfish.  That's a good one.  We'll put it up  on O&A Radio. 
[01:18:30]  The place is infested  with them though.  They were disgusting.  You ever find one  in your bed?  No,  because they were  always in the walls.  But I remember at one point,  I think I counted,  after it would rain,  they'd be all over the place.  I think I counted  five or six on my wall  at the same time.  I was like 32.  I was doing comedy  for I guess nine years  at the time,  11 years at the time.  You should not be  in that situation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I don't feel guilty  about doing well.  No.  I was in a dump  for a long time.  A dump.  Yeah,  but it worked for us, 
[01:19:00]  man,  because we used to have  to drive like an hour and a half  to get back and forth  into the city all the time.  So we needed to be near there  and we're like,  oh,  who cares?  With no money pressure  because you come in  and do 20,  I mean,  $25 is going to do  a comedy seller spot.  So it was like,  we needed to be in a place  where you can come in  and do city spots  without any financial pressure.  It was great.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  And I had one rule,  no prostitutes in the house.  Well,  that's a good rule.  You know what I mean?  Because I was like,  I don't know what,  they might go in my room  and steal stuff.  Right.  So he'd just pull in the driveway  and put like one of those  sun visors up  so that the neighbors  would see and be in the car  with them. 
[01:19:30]  Did you really, Jim?  Yeah,  I did that in my house.  Yeah,  I'd look at it  like two in the morning.  I'd see the visor up  and I'd go,  I'm like,  I'm like,  Jim's in.  That old school visor  that was supposed to keep  the heat off  of your steering wheel.  Right.  And it basically  just kept the wig  from bobbing  so my neighbors  could see it.  Wait,  you did this  in your parents' driveway?  Yeah,  that's where I started doing it.  And then there was  like a little park  and you could occasionally  get horrid  by where we lived.  But I didn't want  to park around there  because I was afraid  of a cop.  So I would park  kind of right by the house  because it was like  a quiet, 
[01:20:00]  dead-end street.  And I'm like,  no cops,  you could always see  who was coming.  Right.  Only the class broads  you were bringing home.  Oh,  they were terrific.  Yeah.  And you're right here  in the car.  Your sweet mom  is inside that house  and all hell's breaking  loose in the driveway.  Well,  that was what I would do  at home.  That's where I first  started doing it.  I was always afraid.  How much does a girl  of that stature cost?  Not a lot.  25 bucks.  Yeah.  30 bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a lot of money.  Yeah.  And Jim used to always  take like the mason jars  from that because he'd drive  around the city  and in case he had to 
[01:20:30]  like,  can I have that?  I'm going to drive around  and look at some hookers  tonight.  I didn't want to get arrested  for going outside  so I would actually  always carry a jar  or a cup  in the car.  It was awful.  You were Lenny Legal.  Dude,  that's how you knew  I was going whoring.  How many times  I left the comedy cellar  and I'm like,  hey,  can I have like  an empty plastic cup  with a lid  and some napkins  and they're like walking.  And some ice for later.  Yeah,  and a little lemon  and two straws  with umbrellas.  Oh my God. 
[01:21:00]  Like just old  peanut butter jars  and stuff,  whatever you can find.  Anything that you could  just stop real quick  and you know,  you had to,  you had to.  I didn't want to walk outside  half the time it's raining  or if it's cold out.  Well,  sure.  And you don't want to get arrested.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to get sick  from the rain or not.  Yeah,  yeah.  Just go with a street walker.  I'll tell you one thing.  I know I've gone in jars before  and things like that  in a pinch there  in the car  and it's not as sanitary 
[01:21:30]  as you know,  your bathroom at home.  You can't really spend much time  making sure everything is gone.  Yeah.  So the girl that you're getting  is now getting an extra treat  when,  here's what you got to do.  There's always a kink in the hose.  Yeah,  yeah.  Kink in the hose.  And John kink it  and like,  you ever shut the water off  and then go to take the nozzle  off your hose?  Yeah.  Yeah,  that's what happens.  There's still water left  in there under pressure.  You got to use it  like a tourniquet.  Like,  you ever see the 1776 poster 
[01:22:00]  where the guy's had  the bandage on his head?  Yeah.  That's what you got to do.  Like,  when you're ready  to open the window  and throw the cup,  like dump the cup,  you have to take a napkin  in your right palm  and cup the top  so you don't,  so the kink in the hose  goes into the napkin.  Okay.  You have to do that.  See,  this guy.  See,  I always get the Gatorade bottles  with the wide mouth.  Need that.  That's a key  because sometimes you don't  and if you got like  a regular water bottle,  it's tough.  Regular water bottle,  I could never do that  in a water bottle,  ever.  A water bottle  or a beer bottle.  In the old days, 
[01:22:30]  I would drive around  drinking a beer.  I would drive  with a beer  between my legs  and just drink  as I'm driving  and when you're done  with a bottle,  you just use it  to go in  and then throw it  out the window  and a beer bottle  is tough to line up.  That's like lining up  a difficult pool shot.  Yeah.  You really have to.  And it's dark  and you don't know  if you're close to the top.  Yeah,  and you can't move  once you start.  Yeah.  Because like that linkage,  you don't have much,  there isn't much plus or minus  on that.  You do realize  those things fill up 
[01:23:00]  real fast.  Yeah,  and then you start panicking  and you go,  uh oh,  let me feel here.  I still got a ways to go  and we're up to the top  of the bud label.  That would be a problem.  I usually keep the Gatorade bottle  under my seat  and one time  I had a girl in the car  and I stopped short  at a traffic light  and it rolled right  under her feet  and she's like,  oh,  you got Gatorade?  I'm thirsty.  I'm like,  nah,  it's been in there  for a while.  She's like,  no,  I'm like,  no,  we'll just stop  and get something.  I should have had  a drink of that.  I should have.  But she was nice.  Oh,  it's delicious. 
[01:23:30]  Lemon lime,  my favorite.  One of my favorite stories  was when I was going  to a gig  and you had a Starbucks cup.  It was a McDonald's cup.  A McDonald's cup  and it was dark  and you didn't realize  the bottom was like,  I guess,  what was it,  leaky?  Yeah,  because I used it  like four different times  to go to the bathroom.  Oh,  God.  So by the fourth time,  you know,  it was one of those  plastic cups.  It was a problem.  It was saturated.  And yeah,  what did you have  to take off your pants  and put them on?  He had to drive to a gig  with his pants off  with them on top 
[01:24:00]  of the dashboard.  Yeah,  with the heat cranking  it was like 90 degrees out  because the bottom fell out  and I didn't know  until about 45 seconds in  I had black jeans on.  I was running late  to a gig  I pulled over,  took my pants off,  put them on there  and just cranked the heat  400 degrees.  That must have smelled great.  It was awful  and as soon as I got in the club  I went right on the stage  and it was all,  I'm like,  all right,  look,  I'll tell you what happened.  I told the story  so I just said,  stop looking at me like that.  I take lemons  and make lemonade  in your pants. 
[01:24:30]  That is great,  man.  Cute story.  All right,  we're going to break  more with Jim Florentine  but you're playing comics.  Yeah,  comics this weekend  in New York  and then also  that metal show  on VH1 Classic.  That's right,  man.  Congrats on that.  Yeah,  me,  Eddie Trunk  and Don Jameson  starts this Saturday.  Very cool.  Oh,  really this Saturday?  Yeah.  What time?  11 o'clock  every Saturday  on VH1 Classic.  And what are you guys  talking about?  Obviously metal  but what's the angle?  It's a half hour,  it's almost like  a best damn sports show  period for,  you know,  just talking about music.  We sit around  and we have a guest  come in  and we just bust 
[01:25:00]  each other's chops  and talk about music  and mess with the fans.  We do these bits  outside concerts  and just screw around  with people.  Did you see  Steven Adler  on Celebrity Rehab?  Yeah.  I didn't even recognize him.  I told the story  yesterday on the air.  I'm like,  wow,  it's a rock dude.  I don't know who he is  but he's really famous  and then they finally  said it was Steven Adler.  I couldn't believe  it's the same guy.  I got a friend  out in California  I just talked to him yesterday.  He's hanging out  with him now.  He said he's a lot better  but he just smokes  a lot of pot.  Oh, really?  Just constantly pot.  He's just got to keep him up 
[01:25:30]  because he's really  down and done.  He thinks with the new  Guns N' Roses  slash and those guys  that will get back together  that he's going to be  part of the band.  Right.  He's a mess.  There's no way he could.  He took it way too far  because it looks like  he had seizures and strokes.  Yeah, he had a stroke  about 15 years ago.  Because his mouth  kind of moves  when he talks  and his eyes  and it looks very tiring.  That was always the joke.  It's like,  how many drugs  do you have to do  to get thrown out  at Guns N' Roses  and he was the one  that did?  And he got thrown out early.  Yeah, he got thrown out  right after  when these guys  were really rocking, right?  Yeah, right before. 
[01:26:00]  87, 88, somewhere around there?  Yeah, right before  Use Your Illusion came out.  He's been out of that band  for over 20 years?  Yeah.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  He was the first to go.  Did he still have money?  I mean, I don't know  how the royalties work  with music.  I'm sure.  Those guys, I'm sure.  Either get paid forever  or they get screwed  on the contract.  They never stopped working.  He did a few projects  on his own  and, you know,  not Guns N' Roses money.  If he wrote the songs  on the first record,  then he wrote,  I think he wrote  some of them.  Oh, did he?  I know Axl and Izzy  write most of the stuff.  He must have had a good deal  because I read  he was the one  that found Axl 
[01:26:30]  through an ad, right?  Yeah.  Wasn't it him and Slash?  It was him and Slash.  Starting the band,  they needed a singer.  Wow.  So those two  were the original members  basically  and then they found Axl.  So I'm assuming  that has to mean something  financially.  What about,  do you hear any of Appetite?  Appetite,  a Chinese democracy?  Yeah.  What do you think?  I like it, man.  I've got about seven songs  that I heard, you know,  that got leaked,  but I think it's going  to be a good record.  It's not going to be  Appetite for Destruction.  That's what everyone's expecting.  Yeah.  That was 87.  That was 21 years ago. 
[01:27:00]  It came out today.  Rolling Stone gave it  four stars.  Did they really?  Out of how many?  I think it's five, right?  Four out of five, I believe.  The one song we heard  was okay.  We didn't love it,  but I didn't listen  to it.  I was expecting it  to be a lot worse.  Yeah.  I really was, but  they have Rolling Stone.  It's a lot of November,  you know,  there's some hard rock  and stuff on it.  It's a lot of songs  like November Rain, too.  They start off slow  and then they start rocking.  I think it's good, man.  It shows you  that Axl can really  write some songs.  I mean, it took them  12 years to write them,  so obviously they better be good.  Yeah, no kidding.  But, you know,  I mean, 
[01:27:30]  I think he's the talented one.  I mean, Slash and stuff,  but the Velvet Rava stuff  I never really got into.  It was all right.  It was all right,  but there was no  smash hits off of that stuff.  No, you're right about that.  You think between  Weiland and all those guys  from GNR  that they can write  unbelievable records.  Yeah.  You know,  so my money's on Axl.  And the new band is good.  I've seen them guys  three times.  Do they have Buckethead still?  No, they got Bumblefoot instead.  Bumblefoot.  He's a Jersey guy  from North Brunswick.  Talk to him, yeah.  He's a great dude, yeah.  Him and one of the dudes  is a black dude,  one of the musicians, right? 
[01:28:00]  No.  Not at all white.  Maybe he's in the new  Guns N' Roses then,  not with Axl.  Maybe he's...  Is Axl still in Guns N' Roses?  Yeah, well...  He's not going out  as Axl Rose.  He's going out  as Guns N' Roses, yeah.  Okay, there was some black dude  Eddie Trunk introduced me to.  Maybe he was in the band and out.  But I thought he was  in the band too.  There were a lot of  lineup changes over the years,  so it's hard to keep track, you know.  What about Black Ice?  The new ACDC album.  I like it.  Everyone's talking about  how great it is.  I like it.  It's good.  You know, look,  it's the same...  Any of those songs  could have been on  an album from 1975  by ACDC. 
[01:28:30]  Wow.  They've never changed their sound.  It's good.  It's a good record.  They know how to get the job done.  They don't have to experiment  with new sounds.  They never know.  They know what works  and they just go,  all right,  it's just more of the same.  And that's one band  even in the 80s  never went to the power ballad.  Every other band  went that way.  Wait, what's the closest  power...  Yeah, understruck.  Yeah, exactly.  They got no slow songs  besides like Ride On  that was on the Dirty Deeds  in 73, so...  Oh, that's...  Okay, very cool.  And more at Florentine.  He's great.  He's really great  in the comedy clubs, 
[01:29:00]  especially comics.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com  But it's Friday and Saturday?  Friday and Saturday, yeah.  All right.  Very cool.  New York on 9th and 14th.  And when we get back,  I think you'd appreciate  this, Florentine.  A new method  of ingesting alcohol.  Beautiful.  This is amazing.  We heard about  the enema thing  that people were trying  for a while.  I think it was  wine enemas or something.  Gets the alcohol  in your system  really, really fast.  You know something?  I've been so drunk  off of wine  just drinking it.  Yeah.  I don't have to get it  in my system any faster 
[01:29:30]  by, you know,  going that route.  It also came out  very dangerous.  Very dangerous.  Did it?  Yeah, you get alcohol poisoning  really, really fast  doing it that way.  But wait to hear  of the new method.  Right after the break,  we'll do that.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got a busy one.  Opie and Anthony  in studio.  Jim Florentine.  He's playing comics  here in New York City  Friday and Saturday night.  And then he's got  the VH1 show  with our old pal  Eddie Trunk  doing a metal show, right?  Eddie's amazing.  I've never seen a guy  that knows more about metal.  It's creepy how much he knows. 
[01:30:00]  It is unbelievable.  He knows, you know,  what band, you know,  the drummer from Saxon  was in when he was 14.  Yeah.  And he has his demo tape.  That's true.  We do a segment  on a show called  Stump the Trunk  where we have some people  from the audience  asking questions.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Yeah, and he gets  like three out of four.  I always throw one in  like he was wearing  this awful leather jacket  in wardrobe.  They dress him up.  I always mean  Don Jamison always wear  like concert shirts.  Yeah.  And then he's like,  you like this?  And I'm like,  oh, no, it looks great.  He doesn't know  we're messing with him.  I'm like, no, it looks fine.  He's like, you sure?  I'm like, dude, 
[01:30:30]  it'll look good on camera.  It will.  And it's the worst thing ever.  He had this big  puffy leather jacket.  So I throw in a question,  you know, who was Ozzy's  whatever.  And then I'm like,  I don't know how  this question got in here, Eddie,  but Rupert started called  and he wants his  leather jacket back.  So we get him every time.  And Bear Grylls  on our couch  behind you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Man vs. Wild.  Of course.  We got a busy one today, sir.  Thanks for coming by  to say hi.  How many seasons  have you guys done already? 
[01:31:00]  I never know  how they measure.  We've done 40 shows now.  I think this is the third.  40?  Third season of it, yeah.  And what's...  We've just finished  filming for the year  two days ago,  so I have to come  straight from location  straight here.  Where were you?  We were in Hell's Canyon, Oregon.  Really?  So yeah,  it was a half one.  What were you doing there?  What kind of hardships?  Yeah.  It's the deepest river gorge  in America  and it's huge, you know.  There's not a road  across this place  for 100 miles.  Not even like a track, 
[01:31:30]  you know.  It's a big old place  and I was dropped  in the high mountains  and the snow up there.  Went through the ice  for a frozen lake,  you know,  genuinely,  completely unintentionally  up there.  I've done it before  where I'm saying,  you know,  this is how you get out of it.  But we were crossing this lake  and it got about  three quarters of the way  and it just went...  So that turned into  a bit of an epic.  But then down  at the river gorge  and, you know,  a whole series of adventures  in.  Almost got pinned  in a big stopper  in the class four rapids  down there.  But anyway,  you know,  it's like all these things 
[01:32:00]  were out of it  and it's all good.  You look a little shell-shocked.  I'll be honest.  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  it's been...  We've filmed 16 shows  this year.  Yeah.  You know,  so it's definitely...  It's been our busiest year  and I've been pushed  more than ever before,  I think.  But we've got a good break now.  I've got a couple of weeks  off and then I'm leading  a climbing trip  down to Antarctica  in two weeks  and then proper break  over Christmas.  Oh, very good.  Is that like a vacation?  Antarctica?  Well,  we just sent a recce crew  down there ahead of us  and they've just said  it's yet to get above 
[01:32:30]  minus 45 degrees.  I was thinking  it should be,  you know,  summertime down there  it should be,  you know,  minus 15,  minus...  Yeah.  It's quite cold  at the moment.  Where do you go on vacation?  Like,  you get to do all this  cool stuff for work  so when you want to relax...  I get home,  I get all my sort of  old climbing friends  ring me up  and they go,  oh, let's go climb.  I go,  do you know what?  I just want no dramas.  Right.  I want to be safe.  I want to be with my family.  I want to be warm.  You should take like  a nine to five job  for a week  for your vacation.  Like an office gig. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  The thing is,  I've just,  you know,  over the years  I've made myself  100% unemployable  in anything sensible  I think now.  Yeah.  How'd you get out  of the Rapids?  Because a lot of people  saying there's  a little chatter around  that you almost  bought it  in the Rapids.  Yeah.  I was,  you know,  Rapids are always scary.  You know,  I think you're so powerless  against these really big  forces of nature  but,  you know,  it was fine  and I got out of it.  I mean,  the biggest danger  actually often  in these big rivers  is the cold.  You know,  you get so cold 
[01:33:30]  in these things.  Yeah.  But,  you know,  you forget it.  I kind of,  you know,  literally,  I have such a dull memory.  I get out of these places  and you forget  about the mosquito bites  or the snakes  or whatever  and everything's great  and it's nice  seeing you guys again  and it's all cool.  What are you doing  in Antarctica?  It seems like  an awful place to go.  What do you do?  Is there any chicks there?  Yeah,  it's a place I've,  you know,  I've dreamt of going  ever since I was a kid.  You know,  it's bigger than China  and India combined  with a population  of like a handful  of this room,  you know,  so we're exploring 
[01:34:00]  some of these  coastal ice shells  that are about  800 foot vertically  straight up ice walls  where the southern ocean  meets the continent  and we're using  these bioethanol pad  little jet skis  to explore that  and then we're  climbing up  one of these  ice faces  sleeping in these  portaledges,  you know,  these hanging  bivouac stuff.  Jesus.  Get over the top  and we're trying  to haul these jet skis up  and then we're  using the wind  to kite ski  across the ice  and we're heading  into the big mountains  and there's one  very remote  unclimbed peak 
[01:34:30]  there that we're  trying to climb  and then we're  using these  electric powered  paragliders  to fly out of there.  So it's the whole  thing's,  you know,  promoting alternative  energy and,  you know,  the stuff we can do  with it  and then home  for Christmas.  I've seen...  Just do it in front  of a green screen.  Yeah, really.  Put all the stuff  in later.  You know,  what's nice for me  is that,  you know,  I do so much  that's man versus wild  and it kind of does  take over a lot  of the year  and,  you know,  ultimately though,  I'm doing man versus wild  because I've done  so much of this  other stuff before  and I kind of want 
[01:35:00]  to make sure  I don't lose touch  of what,  you know,  I've kind of always done  so I'm going with  three of my best-selled  army buddies  and we're heading  down there  and,  you know,  no cameras,  no nothing,  just us guys  and for me  it's a real joy.  It's what I'm  really looking forward to.  How do you sleep  on the side of a mountain  like that?  I've seen those things.  How do you get  a good night's sleep?  It's a hammock  that you nail  into the side  of a mountain  pretty much.  That's the most  insane thing I've seen.  Yeah,  I'll tell you  at Christmas time,  you know,  it's not comfy  and it's small  and you can't roll over 
[01:35:30]  because you've got  a three-foot drop  but,  you know,  the worst places  to be.  We've all slept  somewhere  and you think  you're in your house  or something  and realize,  oh wait,  I'm in a hotel room.  I imagine the same  thing happens  as you're on the side  of a mountain.  Oh,  that's right.  You're right.  I mean,  the cameraman we have  on Man Versus Wild  always sleepwalks  and he said,  yeah,  this is a good job.  I'm not coming  on this Antarctic one.  How wide  is the ledge  you're sleeping on?  It's about  three foot,  two and a half,  three foot.  A lot of the times  these guys  don't even have a ledge.  They have, 
[01:36:00]  what is it called?  Porter ledge.  A porter ledge.  They nail this thing  into the side  of these ledges  and sleep in these  hammocks  that are just hanging.  Yeah,  that's what we're doing.  Off the side.  And the drop is,  you know,  1,000,  2,000 feet.  I don't know.  Why don't you have a helicopter  to just drop you on the top?  We're about 3,000 miles.  But it would be  an amazing experience  to be in this place  that literally is so vast.  I think,  you know,  it's hard for us  to get an idea  of just how remote 
[01:36:30]  some of these places are.  And we film,  you know,  Man Versus Wild  all over the world  and people sometimes say,  you know,  where can you go?  You've been to all these places.  But I find the more places I go,  the more I think,  flipping nor it.  You know,  we're not even scratching  the surface of this.  And,  you know,  I need 10 lifetimes  to get near it.  And it's,  you know,  you go to Hell's Canyon.  You guys probably haven't,  have you heard of Hell's Canyon?  No.  Do you know what I mean?  It's one of the great wildernesses  in America  and nobody's heard of it.  And that's what's amazing  about your country.  You know,  you can just keep going  to these places 
[01:37:00]  and there's no roads,  there's vast mountains,  there's just unbelievably  beautiful scenery  and dramatic landscapes.  But people don't know about it.  See,  there's plenty of room.  Drill.  And wants drilling to...  Drill everywhere.  Everywhere,  sure.  In the new season,  you're going to be wrestling  a boa constrictor?  I had a bit of an incident  with a big boa constrictor  in the jungles of Belize  and it's where we used to  a lot of the training  with the brashami  for the jungle training  and it,  you know,  it's the most dangerous jungle 
[01:37:30]  in the world,  you know,  period.  Yeah.  Why?  Just,  it's got the highest concentration,  you know,  all the nasties,  you know,  all the snakes  and you name it.  Everything else is poison.  Yeah,  it really does.  Poisonous ladybugs.  That's the way,  that's the way animals survive  in the jungle  is that they become so venomous  that they get,  you know,  they're protected  from their prey.  But,  yeah,  so I came across  this big boa constrictor  and...  How big?  Yeah,  it's ten foot, 
[01:38:00]  it's as thick as your leg,  you know,  it's a big aggressive thing,  snapping away at me  and I was,  it went for me  and I backed off  and then tripped over a root  I was moving backwards  and went,  wow!  But anyway,  I had it for breakfast  in the end  and that was all,  all,  you know,  good and,  but jungles are always tough,  you know,  they're,  the shows I've kind of  learnt over the years  to dread  just because it's,  you know,  it's torrential rain all day,  it's just mosquitoes,  it's all the nasty snakes,  you know,  I came across in this deep cave  these whip scorpions  that are undoubtedly  the most nasty looking animals 
[01:38:30]  I've ever seen.  They're about,  a foot across,  a combination of a scorpion  and a massive spider  and they live in the dark  deep underground  in these small caves  I was crawling through  and I came across this one  and you think,  you know,  if Hollywood had tried  to design the most nasty  monster on earth,  you'd,  you'd get somewhere closer  and you'd think,  I never even knew  these things existed.  How do they respond  to like a little scratch  or a friendly little pet?  They move,  they're so hard to catch,  you just go near it  and they're just gone  and blink of an eye  but I did,  I threw a rock  and you got it. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, look at it.  And,  yeah,  there you go.  Ah.  Anyway,  that was lunch.  Oh,  you ate that?  Yeah,  no,  there's a lot  of good energy  in that.  Let's have a look at it.  Oh,  man,  that is nasty.  It certainly is.  Me and Jim got to feel  like the biggest wusses  were complaining about,  oh,  we were afraid of those  silverfish in our apartment.  Yeah,  yeah,  silverfish in the apartment.  They were complaining  about flights.  Do you know,  I don't like the first class  on Continental as much  as I,  ugh,  it's not that bad.  You're a cockroach  and I get home. 
[01:39:30]  Black mold and my stories  don't really hold up  to these.  You hate that.  Yeah,  but I get home  and I'm,  you know,  I kind of love  making cookies with the kids.  Sure.  You know,  I don't tell them  about any of the wusses stuff.  I just come over  to America twice a year  and go on these radio things  and try and remember  what happened.  If a snake,  but I genuinely,  if I tell my family  about this,  you know,  it's fatal.  If a snake like that size  is like choking you out  or grabbing you,  if you have a knife  and you stick the knife in,  is there a way  to kind of like  cut the muscle  on the snake 
[01:40:00]  and get it to like  loosen the grip?  You know,  I've often thought that  if they get around you,  these big boas,  you're really going to  battle to get it off you.  You've got to work  from the head  and unpeel it,  but I used to think,  oh,  maybe you could bite  through it  or cut through it,  but the thing is  they move so fast.  As soon as you did that,  it sort of slithers around  and suddenly you've got  another length of it  in front of you.  You know,  but they crush.  As soon as you breathe out,  they apply more pressure.  You breathe out again,  so you never get a chance  to breathe in  and that's why,  that's how they,  you know,  get that prey. 
[01:40:30]  But,  you know,  I have learned on this,  you've just got to be  so careful with these  big nasty animals  and not mess with them  too much.  You know,  you get it right  every time  and,  you know,  we have a small crew  of us,  three or four of us  filming this  and same guys  who've done almost  all of the shows  for me  and,  you know,  we do go to  difficult places  and I've just learned  that we've really  got to look out  for each other  and,  you know,  they're brilliant,  brilliant guys  and real unsung heroes  in this for me.  Sure.  And you also eat  bear poop.  Why?  Well,  this is in the  Transylvanian mountains 
[01:41:00]  and it's got the  highest concentration  of bears in Europe  and I had a bit of  an encounter  with a big,  a massive brown bear  which I came,  I was in this forest  and came around  and it was just  kind of there  and I was in a red jacket  and everything.  That's good in the forest  to blend in.  Yeah,  exactly.  And it looked to me  and it,  you know,  had a good escape route.  It wasn't trapped,  didn't have young,  you know,  wasn't mating  and,  you know,  it went off  and it was fine  but there was a  massive steaming pile  of bear poop  at the end,  you know,  that it had done 
[01:41:30]  but they have  very fast digestion  and you can see  the bits of berry  and apple in it  so it's fine  to,  you know,  wash it off  and just eat those  and,  you know,  not really fine.  Again,  a low point  in my sort of,  low point  in my quizinary life.  That might be  Jim's next level.  I know.  I get a hooker  to put a bear hat on.  Hello.  Could you just  growl at me  while I land  at this glass  coffee table?  But everyone,  you know, 
[01:42:00]  everyone always talks  about all the kind  of bad stuff I eat  and the bad animals.  You know,  there's a lot  of amazing stuff  and for me,  the privilege of the show  is being in these places  just with a small group of people  and doing what I love  and,  you know,  I get much more nervous  coming to these sort of things  or the big cities,  you know,  but I do come alive  in these places  and it's where,  it's one of the few places  I feel comfortable  and thrive  and it's a great privilege really.  Speaking of that,  you should do like  an urban version.  It would be really good.  Of man versus wild.  It is on the plan.  I know.  It is on the plan, yeah.  Yeah.  I could send you uptown 
[01:42:30]  for a little while.  I'd love to do  a proper urban one there,  you know,  showing all the,  you know,  if you get mugged  or if you get stuck  in subways  or burning buildings  or,  you know,  it's definitely  kind of in the plan.  Dumpster diving,  you can find food in there.  You can visit.  Well, you know,  you're right,  you know,  how to catch rats.  You can live with the mole people.  There's a lot of people  that live on the ground  in this city.  A lot.  You could go like  explore that for a while.  Tunnels underneath the city.  Yeah.  That would be amazing.  Anyway,  next season.  Yeah.  When does the next season start? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, gosh,  I don't know.  I think it's...  It says January.  That doesn't seem right,  is it?  Well, I think it is.  Yeah?  I think it's beginning,  yeah, January.  We're almost there.  I think they've saved  all the kind of...  They're definitely  the best shows  we've done these ones  and I think they've  wanted to bunch them  all together  and then put them  out all at once.  Right.  Are you running out  of things to do  with the show?  No, I think,  you know, not.  I mean, it's...  We've done...  Genuinely,  after 40 shows,  we've done the coolest stuff  I've ever done  on Man vs. Wild for this.  You know,  I'm not saying it  out for press.  You know,  I really...  You know,  I know it  and it's a good feeling 
[01:43:30]  and I think,  you know,  I will leave this show  before it starts getting  the same.  When we start going over  endless old ground,  I will leave it.  Yeah.  But at the moment,  we're still doing  cool, cool stuff  and I'm really proud of them.  How many shots  do you have to get?  Like, you might...  Yeah, I'm a bit of  a pink cushion.  I occasionally get  Discovery Go Bear  who have been looking  at some of these footage  and the behind the scenes  that you just need  to get some jabs.  Cool.  But, you know,  a lot of the point  of the advice  is that it works.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  You know,  that's the point.  So I don't need  a lot of shots.  Sometimes it goes wrong.  I was in filming  on the Iraqi border  for one of the shows  and I got quite bad heat stroke  and almost sort of  had to be evacuated from it.  But, you know,  on the whole,  it sort of,  you know,  generally works out.  What about bees?  Yeah, bees are bad.  What about bees?  I don't know.  I don't like bees.  They bother me.  Yes, they hurt me.  Did you see that show  I got stung  by all those bees?  No.  Literally, my face.  Do you not see that?  I didn't see that one.  Oh, yeah.  Type up... 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, pop that up there.  My face is literally  like an elephant  and I was trying  to get some honey.  I was in Mexico.  I was trying to get  some honey out of this thing  and I'd smoked them  and I'd wrap myself up  but I'd left a little gap here  and these bees just went...  And it was fine  but by an hour later,  literally,  I can't see.  I'm in the middle  of the desert.  I'm trying to kill  this big pit viper as well  and Simon, the cameraman,  directing me  to where the snake is  and it's sort of  coming at me  and I kill the snake,  eat it,  pee inside the snake skin  and then have that  around my neck  and drink the pee 
[01:45:00]  out of it the next day  in the salt pans  but literally,  my face is still  like a balloon out there.  Look at his face.  We'll put that up  on our website too.  Oh, wow.  Did you get nailed?  Is there footage  of you getting stung?  Yeah, yeah.  It's all there.  I want to see that footage  so you look like  Keanu Reeves.  Without eyes.  That's not a compliment  to Keanu Reeves.  A Chinese Keanu Reeves.  Wow, there's not even  a hint of an eyeball there.  That's amazing.  So wait,  you were reaching  into a tree for honey? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I was in a sort  of little cave  but there are nasty  African bees  and aggressive ones.  Every time you come in,  I try to think of  the craziest thing  you've done  that I've seen  because I watch the show.  The camel thing,  I think you still  haven't topped.  Living inside the camel carcass.  Oh, doing the old  Luke Skywalker.  Me and Jim did that  for three years.  Can't you just bring  a Clif Bar with you  instead of trying  to get some honey,  you know?  Right.  It's nutritious. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, you went to Turkey  for the new season?  Yeah, we did.  I was in Istanbul once.  Istanbul's beautiful.  Amazing.  But I'm sure you weren't  just walking around  the streets like I was  looking at dumb rugs.  Well, we had it  right there.  Would you see Pacino there?  Yeah.  They try to...  If you go to, like, Turkey,  all they try to do  is sell you a dumb rug.  Really?  Well, the beach is right there.  Istanbul, right by the airport there.  Isn't there a bunch of hot chicks?  I've been to the airport there. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that would have been nice.  We didn't see no beaches  with hot chicks.  Yeah, that's right.  We went into the Blue Mosque  and we saw a piece  of Mohammed's beard  and they tried to sell us a rug.  You know what you've got to do?  You've got to strap  hashish to yourself  and then try to get on the plane.  There you go.  That's good.  What do you do in Turkey, though?  What's there to do in Turkey  that's adventurous?  There's some seriously  remote parts of that country.  Borders, Syria, Iran, Iraq.  And up in the high mountains there,  it's wild.  I was doing big waterfall descents 
[01:47:00]  and building rafts  and then I ended up  in these amazing canyons  with these Christian caves.  It's where the Christians  used to hide from the Romans.  And literally, you know,  1,000-foot canyon walls  and halfway up  you suddenly see little windows.  And they would have tunneled up  through the rock  and lived, you know,  hundreds and hundreds of them  lived in these communities.  And, you know,  these caves completely unexplored.  You know, there's some, you know,  right down, you know,  20 miles away  where people might have visited.  But, you know,  50 miles down this canyon,  people have just never been there.  And it was amazing. 
[01:47:30]  I was climbing up  all through these things  and then doing big free climbs  up the edge of the canyon wall  out of the windows of these caves.  And it was amazing.  I love that place.  Yeah.  I was amazed  at just how remote parts of it are.  Did you find any cool  little relics and stuff like that?  Did you ever grab a few of those  and take them home?  Yeah, I found an old pirate pipe  when I was in Belize.  Which they reckon  was about 300 years old  and it was a pipe  from one of the pirates there.  That's pretty cool.  That was cool.  It was deep in a cave. 
[01:48:00]  I thought,  there's got to be treasure here.  Yeah.  But sadly,  it was just a whip scorpion down there.  Yeah, that was it.  There was no,  from those caves,  there was no spoons  or just anything that they used?  Yeah.  A hat perhaps?  Huge, great big rock wheels  across these entrances.  And what they do,  they just wheel these across  to one entrance.  And then wells  and little tunnels  and little shelves  and little areas  where they'd cook  and then funnels  where they'd have the water  running down trenches  to all the bedrooms.  Unbelievable. 
[01:48:30]  Untouched for thousands of years.  Wow.  And then I was into  all the desert.  That's when I got heat stroke  and had a bit of a battle then,  but it worked out.  That's wild.  That's a little too much.  Hence man versus wild.  I like,  what do I like?  Watching TV.  Yeah, I know.  I like Call of Duty 5  is coming out,  so I'll play a little of that.  It keeps me safe.  Yeah.  What about,  are you scared?  What were you looking at?  I'm looking at the footage  of him going after, 
[01:49:00]  like you're looking into a cave.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  That's a big,  how big was that beehive?  Oh, gosh,  you know,  it was like,  so big.  Like a foot and a half,  two feet across?  That was really large.  Yeah, that's, uh.  And he's like looking in.  That's not smart.  I'm doing a great job  of narrating, by the way.  One bee that really got me.  One bee just.  It was just one  that really happened  to be right on the vein  in the eye, you know.  Oh.  That's why,  that's why  it kind of went bad,  but hey,  you know,  that's all the bad side  of man versus wild.  There's lots of good.  That's,  that's why 
[01:49:30]  the show is worth watching,  man.  You never know  what's going to happen to you.  So,  all right,  we got to take a break.  I want to thank Bear  for stopping in.  So it's man versus wild  Wednesdays at 10 p.m.  on the Discovery Channel.  They're showing  new episodes in January,  but a lot of people  probably haven't seen  all the older ones.  Yeah, they're all out  Wednesday nights.  They keep rolling them out.  All right.  Wow, creepy.  Cool, thanks.  Nice to be with you guys again.  Absolutely.  Yeah, tuck your shirt  and that'll impress the bees.  Exactly.  You'll see your helmet  and sting that.  He's like,  this guy's not a slob,  so maybe he won't sting him.  He's well-kempt. 
[01:50:00]  So if you smoke them,  normally bees will just  kind of go to sleep.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You're going into a bees hive.  Yeah, I think,  hey, listen,  we learn our lessons,  you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently.  I want to see him  get stung so bad.  I can't wait.  It's just one bee as well.  That's the thing.  It's not all of the crocodiles  and snakes I've had.  It's one ruddy bee  that gets me at the end.  There you are,  smoking out the hive.  Made you look silly.  The hive.  You certainly did.  All right.  A big fire there.  You get a little smoke  and you fan it into the hive. 
[01:50:30]  And what do they do?  That's supposed to  chill the bees out.  There's a lot of flames  going in.  That probably pissed me off.  Yeah,  they probably didn't like  the fire part of the smoke.  No.  Yeah,  because you see the beekeepers,  they got those little things,  those little cans,  and they blow the smoke  on the...  Yeah,  just nice,  like,  but if you haven't got a can,  you know what I mean?  Yeah,  and you got to kind of make it.  Anyway,  I did get the honey  and the honey was great.  And you got something  over your mouth  like Jesse James  robbing a train?  Yeah.  I think that was my underpants. 
[01:51:00]  And one bee gets them.  You got the honey,  though?  Yeah.  And he said it tasted good.  We got to take a break.  So,  Barrett,  thank you so much.  Man vs. Wild,  Wednesdays on the Discovery Channel.  New episodes,  January,  February.  All right?  Thank you.  All right,  we'll continue with Jim Florentine  in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Norton's got a book signing.  You got a lot going on,  actually,  Jimmy.  I got two signings this week.  Tomorrow,  Wednesday,  I haven't been to Staten Island  in probably 10 years.  I'm doing Barnes & Noble 
[01:51:30]  on Richmond Avenue  at 7 p.m.  in Staten Island.  The K-Rock girls will be there.  And then Thursday,  I continue my Whirlwind  nice location tour  to Borders  in Providence,  Rhode Island  on Providence Place.  That's a 6 p.m.  signing.  And then I'm heading up  to Boston  to do the Whirlwind.  10 years.  Wait till you see  that Verrazano toll.  It's going to drive you crazy.  I'll be going into it.  It's got to be $2, $3.  No, no.  It's probably about $11 now.  Yeah.  It is.  You used to have a joke 
[01:52:00]  about the Verrazano.  What was that one you had?  Oh, my.  Like it was $7 or $8 for...  You don't remember it?  I don't remember.  $7 for...  Well, I'm sure Jim does.  I don't know.  I don't remember it, actually.  I'm sure it was something  about AIDS.  No, it was probably  something really like  just very not well thought out.  $7.  Do I get a...  A hooker or something.  Yeah.  Ah, yes.  Just something like  A plus B equals C.  It was probably  some basic crappy joke.  Some basic formula joke. 
[01:52:30]  Drive across the bridge  while you eat obese primate.  Oof.  Remember that one, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  He's always been disgusting  since the beginning  because I started with him  and I remember  the first gig I got him  I was running this open mic  and he did some joke  about having sex  with his grandmother in church.  Yeah.  And like with his mother watching  or pushing on...  I don't know.  Whatever it was.  It was awful.  And I remember  this booker saw us there  and he was booking  these little rooms.  Is that Casey?  Yeah.  And he said,  he goes,  that little kid's a Nazi.  He goes, 
[01:53:00]  that kid...  Don't ever put him  on stage anymore.  I go,  nah, he's a nice guy.  He goes,  nice guy.  Look what he's talking about.  A week later,  the guy calls up.  He goes,  look, I need an MC.  Bring an MC with you.  I bring him.  He shows up.  It's the same booker.  He goes,  come here.  He brings me in the back room.  He goes,  that kid's not going on my stage.  That kid's a Nazi.  And I'm like,  nah, he's fine.  He's not dirty.  He's like,  what do you mean he's not dirty?  I heard his act.  And I told Jim,  I go,  Jim,  you got to cut that joke out.  He's like,  all right,  fine.  And you did.  And you got 25 bucks for the gig.  Yeah,  I saw a photocopy of that.  It was Coast to Coast Entertainment.  I think it was Casey Martin. 
[01:53:30]  He was the booker.  And he gave me some early work.  You gave up your principles for 25 bucks.  You bet I did.  I soft shoed.  But Jim used to follow,  like,  I started about six months before Jim.  He used to come to my gigs at this one place  and sit right in the front table  with,  like,  some other guy.  Tyler,  my buddy.  Tyler,  this black dude,  and just stare at me while I was on stage.  And it was like,  late,  you know,  early 90s,  late 80s,  and I wear the tight pants.  I had long hair.  And he would just stare at my crotch.  And he would just make me uncomfortable.  And I tell the owner of the club,  I go,  get that guy out of the front.  He always comes to my shows.  He's gay.  He just stares at my bulge. 
[01:54:00]  I couldn't help it.  No,  you couldn't not see it  if you were in the first eight rows.  You guys become friends after that.  I thought he was such an ass, too.  I'm like,  this guy Pat Gaynor's like,  I'm going to introduce you to Jammin' Jim.  And he had his snakeskin boots on.  I'm like,  ugh.  Who is this guy?  He had quite the look back then.  I didn't want to meet him either,  believe me.  He's like,  no,  he wants to be a comic.  I'm like,  are you sure that guy doesn't want to be with me?  He's like,  no,  no.  I think he's straight.  When did he get rid of the Jammin' Jim? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah,  about three,  four years.  And I used to DJ on the radio,  so I just used that name.  I was like a rock DJ.  Sure,  why not?  And I had headshots,  so I'm like,  I'm not going to pay for new headshots.  Jim Florentine in studio,  playing comics this weekend here in New York City.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  Friday and Saturday,  and then him and Don  and Eddie Trunk  have a metal show  this Saturday at 11.  It's every Saturday at VH1.  VH1 Classic.  Yeah,  it's good.  Eddie's been really good.  How many episodes did they give you?  We got eight the first season.  We already got picked up for a second season  as an airhead.  Nice,  very good.  What people do you have coming on? 
[01:55:00]  Ace Frehley,  Rush,  Brian Johnson,  Angus Young,  ACDC,  Twisted Sister,  Yngwie Malmsteen,  Lita Ford.  Yngwie!  You get to hang with all those people?  Yeah.  Oh, wow, man.  I think of you every time  when someone's in there,  him creeping around.  I got to get a picture.  Oh, believe me,  I would be a problem.  How was Ace?  Ace is great.  Because Eddie's good friends with Ace,  so Ace doesn't even remember any of the stories,  so he's just,  tell that one,  I don't remember it.  He's like,  I did that?  Really?  You get a lot of that?  He gets along with Gene, 
[01:55:30]  actually,  though.  I thought they hated each other.  Oh, no.  Did you just say Gene Simmons?  Yeah.  You didn't bring up Gene,  did you?  That jackass.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  That bastard.  Oh, boy.  Who's mad at him?  Oh, Gene Simmons is a douchebag.  He's just a tool.  He's a self-promoting ass  who thinks he can get  whatever he wants in this world.  But you can't, Gene,  can you?  You couldn't,  could you?  No,  I didn't really care  until it hit him personally  is what he's getting at. 
[01:56:00]  One time,  I went over to WB-11  and tried,  like,  picking up on my chick.  Yeah.  WB-11,  were you dating her in 97?  Or wherever it was.  C-W-11.  I should remember the C part of that.  Why don't you just say WPIX?  Yeah.  Well, he brought that back.  He was banging Phil Rizzuto.  Picks.  Picks.  Officer Joe Bolton.  Going way back.  Yeah.  Captain McCarthy.  That was his name.  Yeah, it was.  So he tried to pick up your chick?  Yeah, yeah.  And at the time,  she had told him, 
[01:56:30]  you know,  look,  you know,  stop.  Because he was, like,  pushing himself on  or in the office,  like everybody was watching.  And it made her boss  later on go off to her.  What was going on with him?  We were like,  what's his problem?  And so she tells me  what Gene is pulling.  And, uh,  but before she told me,  Gene came right from there to here.  So I do an interview with him.  We're doing the interview.  And he starts, like,  like talking about,  oh, you know,  maybe tonight I'll have sex  with your girlfriend. 
[01:57:00]  Something.  And I start laughing.  I'm like,  what?  Right.  Like he's just throwing it in  as a jab to me,  knowing what he knows,  me not knowing what happened.  Okay.  And it was, you know,  kind of serious at the time  because he was, you know,  being a real, like, douche  about the whole thing.  Um, and, uh,  and you're, like,  making me look like a sap,  like a sap,  like a douche.  So, uh,  Gene Simmons can kiss my ass.  He's coming on our show  promoting his garbage,  his kiss garbage.  And, uh, 
[01:57:30]  and meanwhile,  he's personally, uh,  disrespecting me.  Yep.  And, uh, uh,  the girl that I was going out  with at the time  that I don't care now  if he, you know,  tags with the whole band,  but whatever.  But at the time,  it meant something.  At the time,  it was like,  it really pissed me off,  stupid Gene.  And then I brought up  his dumb porno movie  that he put out  because he's,  he's, he's,  he's trying so hard  for attention  that he's got to put out  a porno.  Uh, one of these,  oh, someone,  the tape got out.  Ooh, did it? 
[01:58:00]  And there he is  doing the slow-mo hump.  What a lousy,  lousy, lousy lay.  It was bad.  I didn't see it.  Yeah.  Oh, horrid.  Just this slow-lumbering,  mix it up a little,  Gene.  Mix it up.  God damn.  He's, he's just,  the, the, the,  the one position,  just same speed.  The girl looked thrilled  to have him on top of her. 
[01:58:30]  Ugh.  Yeah, especially if you're  taping it,  you're going to want  to put out a performance.  Do something.  Yeah.  Grab an ankle.  Something.  You didn't say it's  black and white?  No.  It's not a good movie.  No, it's awful.  You got it, Dan?  It's horrible.  It's not that impressive.  And you would think  if Gene Simmons  was going to make a movie,  he'd like tie it  into the kiss thing  and, you know,  show that he could still,  you know,  when he was on stage  and that tongue  would come out.  Like, show a little  action like that.  Wear a kiss condom.  Yeah, something.  This lumbering,  slow motion.  Blah. 
[01:59:00]  Blah.  Blah.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Yeah, here I am.  I'm going to get this girl.  Yeah.  That's all she gets.  That's what I'm doing.  This is all you're  going to get from Gene.  This is all she gets.  And this will cost you.  Right now he's thinking  of copyright infringements  that are going on  all over the globe.  The kiss logo.  She tried.  How could I screw over  other bandmates for money?  Yeah, something went on  because she went to grab his hair  and quickly moved her hand.  Moved her hand.  Oh, of course,  because it would have come off  on her hand.  That head of hair. 
[01:59:30]  Stop it.  Look at this lucky girl  what she's getting.  She is sexy though, man.  That's what she's getting.  Oh, God.  What are they on?  A bathroom rug?  That's a bed.  Is it?  Yeah.  Looks like a crappy bed  too, Gene.  It's like an afghan  or something  on top of the bed.  Anyway, before we...  She's got her shoes on.  He's got his shoes on.  What is this?  Doesn't even take his pants  all the way off.  Is he wearing socks?  I don't know.  His pants are still  by his ankles.  Yeah.  You gotta like that, though.  The hour of him shimmy  and go,  I have to drop a turd 
[02:00:00]  and just shimmy away  with his pants  by his ankles  like an old todger.  Now she's...  He appears to be on top.  Look at him.  There's no effort.  He's chewing gum  in the middle of it.  No effort  is he putting forth.  For all of his sexual prowess  he loves to talk about,  he is just awful.  God, no payoff whatsoever.  She's sexy, though, man.  Look at her little...  How could I capitalize  on a kiss lunchbox? 
[02:00:30]  That is pretty bad.  He's not even grabbing her  at all when she's on top.  He's just...  Oh, God, Gene.  He's just there.  Hey, because we promised  that we got to get this on.  New method of ingesting alcohol.  Have you guys figured  this one out yet?  No.  Now, we heard about the enema.  People were doing that for a while  and it hits your system  a lot faster  and it's very dangerous.  Well, the kids have figured out  another way to get the alcohol  into them faster.  Listen to this.  Everyone's probably laughing  because I've got a box of tampons.  You know, but some women 
[02:01:00]  are soaking tampons in vodka,  inserting them into their vaginas  and men into their rectums  for a quick high on alcohol.  So they're basically  dipping it in  and then when they insert this  into those areas,  it goes straight  into their bloodstreams.  It's just like injecting it.  There's no...  Stop.  Maybe two girls tried this.  Who's doing this?  Who's doing this?  And what guy is doing this?  All the gay guys  are into a lot of weird stuff.  Who's doing this for real?  This is a little titillation 
[02:01:30]  for their final news program.  There's no reason for that.  What is it?  What are you doing  with a tampon?  Just dipped in booze.  Vaginally,  that is just going to destroy  the vagina.  I mean, the vaginal...  Well, there's a doctor.  She knows that.  Well, let me tell you something.  You ever have a toothache?  And, you know,  before I had dental coverage,  what you would do  is take some Jack Daniels  and a shot glass  and you swish it around  by that awful tooth  and the pain would just go away. 
[02:02:00]  And you would gulp it down.  But, you know,  even before you swallowed it  and realized you were drunk,  the pain would go away.  But your cheek,  like, it would eat away  at any membrane on your cheek.  So if you ran your tongue  on your cheek  where that side was,  where the Jack Daniels  was being held,  it would be all rough  and kind of rugged, you know?  So I could see that  it just would eat away  at the membrane  inside the vaginal wall there  and just really,  like she said,  destroy it.  From one tamp? 
[02:02:30]  Well, maybe not one,  but...  Vaginally,  that is just going to destroy  the vagina.  I mean,  the bacterial environment  is a nice balance for women.  It's a perfect equilibrium.  When you do something like that,  you can completely destroy it.  You're going to set yourself up  for yeast infections,  bacterial infections,  not to mention  the vagina material  is going to crack and break  because you're going to get burns  and things like that.  So it's just going to  completely destroy the vagina.  It's hysterical.  I'm just trying to find out  what could possibly be fun about this.  Well,  wow. 
[02:03:00]  Girl drunk.  Yeah,  drunk girl doing that  is hysterical.  Jimmy's prepping  to get hammered later.  He's cleaning out.  Tampon just came out.  That's a hell of a...  Yeah, I know.  A hell of a way  to get drunk.  I thought you were going  to tell me something  maybe I could use,  experiment with,  or have a little fun with.  I'm not doing that,  O.P.  Well...  And you know  the other thing about this  is unlike... 
[02:03:30]  Let's say you've had two beers.  You know you've had two beers.  With this,  you don't know.  You could do this,  stand up,  fall,  crack your head,  and die.  You have no control.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, really?  By the way,  I think we should cover this story again  in ten minutes.  Of course.  Yes.  Of course.  I want to talk about the cop,  how he has to give the breathalyzer.  Yeah, we definitely have to talk about this  in a few minutes.  Yeah, maybe.  I think we all have a Bloody Mary joke in us. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, I did.  Who are you kidding?  Who doesn't like one of those  on a Sunday morning?  Oh, they're great with brunch.  Oh, boy.  They're fantastic.  Terrific.  You know,  I thought this was bizarre.  This next story  is even more bizarre.  I had never heard of it  until recently.  Beer bongs.  Children,  kids are doing this  into their anuses.  Literally.  Taking a beer bong. 
[02:04:30]  And, Jim,  you've got an example there.  It kind of reminds you  of the old college days.  You know,  but this,  instead of going in the mouth,  you're sticking it somewhere else.  Does it look fun?  Does it look fun?  Certainly does.  Why would you ask that, sir?  Does it look fun?  Like,  I don't understand  what you're doing  with the beer bong.  You're just pouring?  I guess.  I'll figure that out.  I need pictures.  I guess.  I need pictures.  And then, finally.  I can't.  I just,  I don't get it.  Well,  there's something, 
[02:05:00]  like you said,  if you drink  into your stomach,  there's first-pass metabolism  through your liver.  Well,  there are some blood vessels  in the rectum  that miss that first pass.  Sure.  You do feel the effects quicker.  We're trying to teach our kids  creativity,  but not this guy.  I mean,  sure.  Well,  you just did.  That's what I hate  about these asses.  Hey,  you get drunk quicker.  They just turned  a lot of teenagers  onto a new method.  Bypasses the liver.  They make believe  they're, like,  getting the knowledge  out there,  you know,  to watch out for this, 
[02:05:30]  but more people  will now do it  because of their dumb report.  I'd love to have someone  do it that way,  and then,  you know,  some new guy walks in,  like,  oh,  do a beer bong  out of your mouth.  Yeah.  This beer tastes like crap.  Jim,  you were a big drinker  back in the day.  Do you do anything  creepy like that?  No,  never.  Never anything.  It was always  just out of a bottle.  Never anything fancy.  It was using Meisterbrow.  There was no  brain alcohol.  No orifice evolved?  No,  no,  I never did.  None.  I used to snort vodka 
[02:06:00]  as a goof.  No.  Yeah,  they called it,  what,  a Chili Willy  or something like that?  Yeah.  Like,  you turn over the shot glass  and that little,  like,  thing.  Yeah,  the little indent.  Yeah,  you're not doing much,  but...  I would just drink it  like a normal human being.  As a goof,  we would snort vodka shots,  yeah.  Not the whole shot.  That would be insane.  You'd drink, Jim?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  if I want to get a quick buzz,  I'll do,  like,  a couple shots of Jaeger  and a beer.  Yeah,  that's my point.  I get it within,  like,  20 minutes.  I get a nice buzz.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  I don't need to put it in,  put it somewhere.  You know what the problem  I have is,  especially with drinking beers,  I will just drink beer  all day.  Like,  if I'm drinking two,  I'm drinking a 12-pack.  Just hanging out.  Why not?  Like,  I can't just stop at two.  The word you're looking for  is alcoholic.  Oh,  is it?  One's too many  and a hundred's not enough.  They kind of defined it,  Ann.  Yeah.  No,  it's...  Sorry to say.  No,  I'm saying,  if I had to stop, 
[02:07:00]  I'd stop.  But I just don't,  like,  I choose not to.  It's just...  You start drinking  during a day?  I'll just sit there  and drink.  What am I going to drink  at night?  I got to go to sleep  at seven.  That's true.  You know?  So,  afternoon...  Start drinking  during the view.  On the drive home.  All right.  Unfortunately,  we got to head out.  So,  Florentine's at Comics  Friday and Saturday.  Go see him.  Great comic. 
[02:07:30]  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y dot com.  Yeah.  Everybody knows Florentine's hilarious.  Yes.  Of course,  the show with Don  and Eddie Trunk  is Saturday nights  on VH1,  a metal show,  which I didn't realize  you had so many  really cool people on there.  Yeah,  yeah,  we got some good guests.  And Joe Howard's  actually on the show  at Comics.  He's a Cleveland comic.  He's coming in.  And he's a really funny guy.  He's a big fan of the show.  Okay.  So,  he's coming to open it for me.  Very nice.  All right.  We're going to continue  in just a bit.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:08:00]  Hi.  Jim Florentine.  Don Jameson.  Yo.  We were talking about  tampons with vodka.  Pussies.  And assholes.  See the difference?  See what we do now? 
[02:08:30]  Have a straight conversation.  Now we can talk about  the Bloody Marys.  Yeah,  I feel like I was  hanging out with my family  at the Thanksgiving table  and I couldn't talk about it.  And now we're in the basement  with the guys.  Yeah,  it's just like  elucidating our belt buckles  and talking like men.  Right?  Yeah.  I wouldn't.  Yeah,  I know.  This is great.  Now we're in the studio  with like 10 TVs,  so we're constantly distracted.  We do this all day.  It's like we're talking  about something  and they go,  look at that! 
[02:09:00]  I know I say this almost,  well,  not weekly,  but you sure there wasn't  a TV that used to be  right there?  I keep thinking  people are pilfering.  Are they starting to take shit?  Because if I would,  this business is so like  on shaky ground,  I would just start taking shit.  That's what I did.  Yeah,  leaving with stuff.  When I knew they were  changing formats in Buffalo  when I worked up there,  I'm like,  oh man,  this is a great opportunity.  I went right to the prize closet  and I was set.  Took all the CDs and stuff.  Box sets,  everything.  Concert tickets, 
[02:09:30]  Buffalo Bills tickets.  I destroyed the place  and no one cared.  That was the beauty of it.  They didn't come after me.  They're like,  yeah,  well,  we got you in the end  because you're fired.  I'm like,  all right,  but I'd leave with some nice  consolation prizes.  Some swag.  Some swag,  right.  Were they switching formats  or are they just getting ready?  Yeah,  they switched.  I think Opie made it through.  I'm sorry.  I thought you made it through that one.  Well,  they fired all of us  and then they sat a few of us down  and said,  well,  you're not really fired.  I'm like,  well,  thanks.  They say,  good,  I stole all the shit  and I'm not even fired, 
[02:10:00]  you idiot.  I forgot about that.  You're right.  But then they went Younger Rock  so like I had the yes box set.  We're not playing yes anymore.  Yeah,  you're right.  Yeah,  but they should have maybe sat me down  ahead of time  and then gave me the wink  in the conference room  when they were firing everyone  like everyone's fired,  but you know who?  Wink,  wink.  Right.  Where's our scummiest intern?  Do we have one today?  I don't know.  I want this weird thing every day.  I'm really difficult.  A fucking pen  and there's never one here.  All I want  is something with ink in it. 
[02:10:30]  Really?  Fucking irritating.  You want cakey,  not flaky?  Is that what you get at?  No,  no,  I don't want cakey,  not flaky.  They're talking about Starbucks  all over the place  because their profits  are down 97%.  I want gamey.  You want gamey?  Yes.  I need a little fucking douchebag  to go out  and get my goddamn  Call of Duty 5.  Oh,  nice.  Nice.  Travis,  where's the intern?  What the fuck's he doing?  We only have one for this.  I know,  but I want a pen on the table.  I can't send him out  for a game  if we only got one.  Fuck it.  Yes, you can. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Why don't you do it,  Travis?  You don't do anything.  I'll go do it.  I'll buy myself one.  All right,  go.  Look at him.  That's right.  I don't care.  Get Anthony's Call of Duty game.  Pick me up some Melba Toast.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Melba Toast?  I love Melba Toast.  What are you,  85?  Melba Toast.  That's something like  80% when you were starving  and never ate nothing left?  You put jam on that?  Huh?  You go to home  and watch Murder,  She Wrote?  Yeah.  You put marmalade on that?  I was only kidding.  I don't like Melba Toast. 
[02:11:30]  Little marmalade.  Yeah,  little orange marmalade.  My mother used to buy  the worst fucking shit  for just snacking  because she was constantly  like,  I guess,  trying to keep her weight down  until she found Coke,  which was great.  She didn't have to worry about it.  But she would,  because she was a cocktail waitress,  so she had to be,  you know,  thin.  So she would get Melba Toast  and fucking like this,  diet coffee soda.  It was everything she knew  kids would never fucking eat  and then put it in our room.  And then it was like 
[02:12:00]  the AIDS diet plan.  She had the chocolate  AIDS diet plan,  which in hindsight  is hysterical.  You ever hear  those old commercials?  Oh,  those are fantastic.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  A-Y-D-S.  Lose weight with AIDS.  Wait,  we gotta play one.  Yeah,  I'd like to hear that again.  We gotta play one.  With AIDS,  the pounds will melt off of you.  I bet they will.  Fucking Brady Bunch  theme music is playing behind it.  And then what's the chocolate ones?  Yeah,  that was AIDS.  That was it,  called AIDS.  Right,  okay.  But I used to,  oh,  did I eat the AIDS? 
[02:12:30]  Oh,  did I love those AIDS?  I'm sure Jim has tails.  Yeah.  Same chocolatey mouth  when he's done to it.  We got one of those there.  All right,  listen to this.  I was overweight  and embarrassed  to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me  get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan  helped me get back  into a size 6.  AIDS helps control  your appetite  so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you  taste,  chew,  and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant  in AIDS is not a stimulant. 
[02:13:00]  AIDS helps me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it  that could make me nervous.  Question,  why take diet pills  when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight  safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  This couldn't have been  worded any better  if they said,  enjoy this chocolate  that shot out of a cock  all over your face.  It couldn't have been  worded better.  I like the one,  I'm down to a size 12.  Thanks to AIDS.  Thanks to AIDS.  What kind of  unfuckable monster  were you before that? 
[02:13:30]  You're down to a 12  big slappy-titted retard.  But imagine you own the AIDS  and then the new AIDS  comes in  and destroys your fucking company.  Because that was AYDS.  Once the A-I-DS came out,  it pretty much ruined it.  Guys,  we're going to be rich.  AIDS has really taken off.  Who wants to buy stock?  We're going public next week.  What?  Rock Hudson what?  I'm like,  whoa, shit.  Let's get back to  the alcohol tampons.  Just call it  fucking pancreatic cancer  and try again. 
[02:14:00]  Lose weight  with pancreatic cancer.  Yes.  We got to get back  to the alcohol tampons  because we didn't do  that story justice.  We say hi to Mike  in Ohio.  Mikey.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Mike?  Hi.  What's up, Mike?  That newscast  you had on earlier  that you always make fun of  that is very informative.  Why?  Well,  now if I go out  and catch my son  out behind the garage  with a funnel up his ass,  I might not have thought  nothing about that before,  but he could be drinking. 
[02:14:30]  Well,  wouldn't that be a relief  that he's,  like,  drinking  if you see your son  with a bottle up his ass?  A funnel.  Oh,  a funnel,  you said.  Oh,  that's different.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  Yeah,  that's okay.  There's some things  I guess you could  have up your ass  and your dad's  not going to be concerned.  Well,  you don't want  your kids drinking.  That's bad.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Yeah.  Dave the trucker.  Dave,  what are you hauling today?  Lumber.  Lumber?  That's boring.  In the year 2008,  I don't think we need  to be moving 
[02:15:00]  our lumber around.  Hey,  it gives me a job,  so.  All right.  But,  so that the tampon,  you know,  the girl's been using  that for years.  Wisconsin and Minnesota,  the high school girl  has been doing that.  All right.  That story really  climaxed nicely.  Yeah.  I'm so glad  we attempted  the bit pyramid  that Eric Logan  taught us.  Remember?  Just all I want to do  is hear about  a tractor trailer  spewing lumber 
[02:15:30]  all over the road  and the driver  being killed.  That would do me.  Did you see footage?  Somebody sent me a link  to that truck going,  it was going around  a turn somewhere  and it fucking  flipped over  and went off the side  of the mountain  or whatever.  Oh, no,  I didn't see  the side of the mountain.  You don't see,  well,  I think it was.  It was,  they don't show it  going off the side  of the mountain.  You just see it  fucking roll.  It's being shot  from a dashboard cam  and you see it roll  and then there's  all this smoke  and stuff  and the truck,  whatever vehicle  is filming  drives by  and you don't  see the truck 
[02:16:00]  anymore.  It just disappeared.  Was he okay?  I hope,  I mean,  he couldn't have been.  I hope,  well,  now that I think about it,  he couldn't have been okay.  We have to be getting,  and I'm the last person  to fucking bring  this psychobabble shit up  that they always do  when they talk about  what you can see  these days and everything,  but we have to be  getting desensitized  to the shit  that's going on  because of,  like,  I've popped shit  up on the web.  Remember,  I would always say  I never want to look  at, like,  the dead shit  and the, like,  ripped apart stuff.  That stuff, 
[02:16:30]  anything sexual  is fine by me.  I'll fucking look  at girls shitting  in each other's mouths.  I don't care.  Whatever it is sexual,  it's hysterical to me.  Gay porn,  there was a day  all the guys  were in the office  just watching  gay porn  laughing our asses off  at how silly  one man looks  sticking his dick  in another man's asshole.  It just looks funny.  It's funny.  Them kissing,  I can't look at.  But fucking  is hysterical.  And, uh,  like any of that, 
[02:17:00]  I'll watch it.  Any of the disgusting,  like,  here's fucking somebody  that was in a motorcycle  accident at 100 miles an hour  like laid out  100 yards long  their legs and shit.  I can't watch that.  I've just started  to be able to look  at stills, though,  where I'm like,  well, that's kind of  fucked up.  And then I start thinking,  in a month or two,  I'm going to be looking  at videos of fucking,  you know,  people half dead  in the street.  Jerking off to it.  Yeah, and just like  pounded my meat to it.  Exactly.  Like, I could look  at insurgents  and shit like that  in Iraq. 
[02:17:30]  I could look at that shit.  I can't look at our guys,  but I could look  at their side  getting fucked up  for some reason  that's fine by me.  Go to bloodshows.com.  Bloodshows.com.  Bloodshows.com.  That's the bad one.  Fucking awful.  And I watched  a reaction shot  of a bunch of brothers  in a room  and they're watching  a Chechnyan beheading.  And the brothers  were hysterical.  They're like,  don't you know,  they're just  completely freaking out.  But I can't watch 
[02:18:00]  the actual beheadings yet.  I just got a video of that  from the Taliban  cutting one of our  guys' heads off.  And I still,  it was two years ago,  I'm still fucking freaked out.  Jimmy describes  the guy making pig noises  because he's squealing.  I can't,  that shit knew.  It was all,  I'm still,  I get the chills from it.  They were holding  the head up  in the camera  like that afterwards.  Who said,  who said,  who was any of that  saying that after  you beheaded,  you always just have  that dumb goofy face on  where your eyes  are all kind of  fucked up in your mouth. 
[02:18:30]  It just looks all goofy  and I can't,  I can't watch it.  I can't listen to that shit.  But it looks like  you're heading that way.  But it gets me like,  like, yeah,  you know,  I kind of got desensitized  a little to at least  the still pictures  of people that have  jumped out of windows  and just splatted  on the street or something.  It's like,  all right,  it's still,  I'll look at that.  Oh, fuck,  you know,  or that shotgun guy  that did the head  where it's just split open  like a Y.  Yeah.  Like I looked at that.  Oh, that politician guy? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, no.  I've watched that.  That's a video of all time.  But no,  this is some guy  that committed suicide  and his head blew open  like when in T2,  when the T2000  got shot in the head  and it split apart.  Right.  You know,  his didn't come back  together again.  It just kind of  stayed in that Y shape.  We just,  we are,  we're like so desensitized  to violence  and just bloodshed  and guts  and sex too.  Two girls in a cup.  Two girls in one cup.  That put me over the edge.  At first, 
[02:19:30]  I couldn't watch it.  I was like gagging  and stuff.  Now,  I'll fucking show it  on Thanksgiving.  I don't care.  It's one of those videos  that I find it fantastic now.  Looks like Tasty Delight.  I know.  Yeah,  it's a dairy queen.  That's easy.  That's easy.  The worst video  on bloodshed.  I mean,  there's a lot of them.  There's a couple of people  being burned alive  which are terrible.  That's gotta be fun.  Dude,  there's one Islamic punishment video  where there's a well  or a pit  that's been dug  and there's a fire in it  and they're like,  you know,  I'm not a luck bar  and they're like  throwing gas 
[02:20:00]  on these three guys  that are tied up  and they just fucking...  Do they know  what's gonna happen?  I think they do.  They're blindfolded.  But I think they suspect  when they hear  the crackling flame  and they smell gas  that they have...  That's really the worst part,  don't you think?  It's not the burning so much,  it's the crackling sound.  This is a fraternity thing  like when they put bananas  in the toilet  and say you're squeezing feces.  When do they realize  it's not an April Fool's crack?  When they feel the foot on them  just kicking them  into the fucking pit  and they feel  an intense pain.  Those two guys died 
[02:20:30]  in that truck video.  Oh, did they?  Just so you know.  We'll update on that.  So I know  the worst one on there,  the most graphic,  it's called Blood Gutted  and it's fucking...  It's almost unwatchable  and I can watch anything.  It's these...  What is it,  two people having sensitive sex  with each other?  Yes, and then he says  I love you.  Actually loving each other  and she says  I love you too  and then he says  No money exchanged.  Yes, and she tinkled  in the toilet  and wipes it off.  What are you doing?  That is disgusting.  Exactly. 
[02:21:00]  It's...  I think it's also  Chechenian and Russian  and they're barking.  They are fucking animals.  They don't play fucking games.  Like in the school  just hanging explosives  up in the gym  with the kids  and sending it off.  What not?  Why not?  No, they're not Arabs  so I'm guessing  they're Chechenians.  They are Muslim.  Yes, they are.  The Chechnians are.  And I'm guessing  that Russian soldiers  or whoever they are  they're in a field  it looks so  like you could scream  and no one's gonna hear you.  It's outdoors in the field  and there might be  four or five soldiers  laying bound 
[02:21:30]  with their hands tied  behind their back  and they all get  their throats cut  and they get bled out.  It's like  they're not beheaded  but the throat gets cut  and then the guy  will reach up  under the chin  and work the head  like a Pez dispenser  to bleed them out.  Holy shit.  It's fucking  what are you watching  that for?  Where's Iraq?  No, I don't want  to see that.  I do.  You're crazy.  I want to see it.  I don't want to see that.  I don't want to see that.  I would never want to see it.  It stays with you too long. 
[02:22:00]  Nobody has to watch it.  I can't get those days  versus wild.  Those days when you're  feeling a little down  it creeps into your head  and then you really  feel like shit.  When you feel a little weak.  You're in the middle  of banging a chick  ready to bang her  and that fucking thought  comes in.  It's really fun.  Is everything okay?  I'm like, no.  Where did your heart  on go?  It bled out.  Why would anybody  in the office  be listening to the show?  Why would they?  There's layoffs  every other day.  It's like the field  I'm talking about.  You can scream  as loud as you want  and no one can hear you.  Steve, yes. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, shit.  I want to bring  the sexiness  back to the show.  We got Eric leading.  That's what I was trying to do.  Eric.  Eric.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, have you guys  checked out  that Come Omelette video?  I've been waiting  to see Come Omelette.  I've heard about it.  Can we talk about it  afterwards?  Because I've got an  omelette coming  in about two minutes.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Comeomelette.com, huh?  Eggwhites, huh?  No yolk?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  That's the only way  you can make a come omelette.  Oh, God.  How are you going 
[02:23:00]  to get the yellow?  Yeah, I don't want  to get the fucking omelette.  I know.  I don't want to get  the guy in a call.  Yeah, right?  That's good.  All right.  Comeomelette.com.  That's wonderful.  No.  What?  No, I don't want  to watch Come Omelette.  I don't want to watch  the heavy one.  Yeah, if you guys need  to, that's fine,  but I'm not.  I don't know  if I've seen Come Omelette.  I don't mean that.  I mean the actual  food product.  Oh, okay.  How about we go  with Come Omelette?  What's that about?  Well, that is...  Well, I'll describe it. 
[02:23:30]  You've seen Come Omelette?  No, I've heard about it,  and I've heard it  described to me,  but I haven't seen it.  I want to see this.  Yeah.  Some chick.  You know Bukkake  is fantastic.  That shit will fry up nice?  No way.  Put it in a frying pan  and cook it up  like an omelette  and eats it.  No.  Fucking jizz.  That's got to be  a big load, though.  It was a bunch of loads  from a bunch of guys.  Oh, a bunch of loads.  Just doing a gangbang  Bukkake thing.  Right.  All over her face,  and then they smeared it  off her face  and into a measuring cup  or something 
[02:24:00]  or into a frying pan,  and then there it is.  Cook it up.  Get a good one.  Did they do the switcheroo?  I don't know.  I haven't seen it,  but I'm always very skeptical  of things like that.  You look for the cut.  Like the two girls,  one cup,  I was very skeptical  that that was actually shit.  Yeah.  But, um...  Do they throw broccoli in  and cheese and tomatoes  and stuff?  Yeah, you got it.  Just fucking regular jizz  doesn't taste good.  You got to put a few spices  in there.  Pepper.  People are trying to figure out  who else we got in the studio.  Don Jameson.  I thought I said that.  He's doing the metal show 
[02:24:30]  with Jim Florentine,  who's in here,  and Eddie Trunk,  who's not in here.  On VH1.  Yeah, VH1 Classic  this Saturday night.  Saturday night's  at 11 o'clock.  That's very cool.  We find Come Omelette?  I just...  We can't get it up on...  Yeah, no newspapers  and...  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Where's...  Steve, where's the newspaper?  I think that because  there was one intern...  What's he doing?  It doesn't matter  we have one intern.  We have 12 guys  that work for the show.  Someone has to step up  and maybe do something  they don't want to do.  So we're all prepared  and come to work.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:25:00]  They even cut back  on the newspapers?  Is this Come Omelette?  Yes.  All right.  Well, it's hosted  on Sluthead.com, man.  TheSluthead.com?  I tried to get  that domain.  All right.  She's got a face  full of jizz.  A couple of guys  just jacked off  in her face.  She's already got  a pretty full tone.  You could turn it  a little more.  When are they going  to fix their  show?  They're never fixing  anything around here.  Why would they?  She's got a mouthful.  She looks like she's  under the influence  of some kind of drugs.  You think?  Why else would you do this?  There's another load.  Because it's Saturday. 
[02:25:30]  What do you feel  about these loads  on the face, Norton?  What do you think  about those vids?  Well, this all depends  on what position you're in.  If you're the load giver,  it's fantastic.  If you're the kneeling girl  with a mortgage payment,  not good.  Now they're scraping  into a measuring cup  the jizz with a spatula.  That's the best part  of this video.  Some dude,  or it has to be  another girl,  I would assume, right?  Working the spatula  and scraping the tongue  into a big measuring cup.  A big Pyrex measuring cup  like Mom used to use.  Martha Stewart  teaching how to make 
[02:26:00]  a jizz omelette.  Now you're going to get  some of that brown shit  from your tongue  in the omelette mix.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, no.  Some tongue scrapings.  All right,  that could be a load.  It looks like egg white.  All right, wait,  that might be the switcheroo.  They could have done  the switcheroo right there.  It looked like,  why didn't they show it?  They should have went,  you know what?  No, that's too much.  That's way too much.  That's fucking switcheroo.  We did a switcheroo.  I make my own egg white omelette  so there's no way  it comes out that big.  Yeah, no.  I've had all that cum on my face  and it just doesn't translate. 
[02:26:30]  Boom, boom.  Oh, come on.  Why don't we do this  to see if it works?  Yeah, what would it,  because I don't think  cum would cook up  like an egg omelette.  It gets all fluffy.  Oh, all right.  Well, the guy is  cumming on the omelette.  That's a little different.  Well, why would you need  cum on the omelette  if already  the thing's made out of cum?  I don't know,  maybe just more, you know.  This is for the skeptics out there.  But now another cut right there,  so who knows?  Another cut,  so now she's eating  tasty egg whites, probably.  I like the fact  the other girl's feeding her  with a chef hat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to make it authentic.  I don't know.  She likes her as a runny. 
[02:27:00]  They actually have a prop budget.  Let's look for the acting skills.  She's now...  All right.  That's acting.  Sorry.  This isn't...  This isn't...  I'm disappointed.  It's on cum omelette.  I am too.  I heard about cum omelette  now for a while.  She wouldn't be gagging.  She wouldn't be like  smiling and chewing.  No, I'm sorry.  You guys missed a good one.  Blood gut is a fucking...  It's just a truly good one.  I'm not watching that.  You don't have to.  I'm not watching it.  You could have just  listened to the audio.  No, I won't even listen.  I'll leave.  I hate that. 
[02:27:30]  I can't.  I can't, Jimmy.  I'll show him a puss.  I can't go there.  She's being fed.  But, like I said,  I think that's just...  She's got cum all over her face.  What's the fucking big deal  if it's cooked?  Exactly.  You know, she's all of a sudden  a little shy.  That's not real.  No.  Yeah.  I dub it fake.  Absolutely.  I hate fake fucking shit  on the internet.  Especially when I really thought  I was going to see a girl  eating a load of cum  cooked up like an omelet.  Yeah.  We got Prince from South Carolina  that has a question 
[02:28:00]  about this whole thing.  Prince, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  Hey, man.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy,  I got a question for you today, bud.  Sure.  You think this year  maybe perhaps  the likes to cum?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  Um, no.  I don't think she likes cum.  Well, you heard him  say it right there.  She loves it! 
[02:28:30]  Let's say hi to John  in Tennessee.  John.  John.  Yeah.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  What's going on?  What's up, John?  What do you got?  I'm fucking wiping my mouth off  with puke from that  nasty-ass segment  y'all did.  What?  The cum fucking omelet?  Yeah, that was disgusting.  Oh, you didn't like that?  No, I guess  if I had a vivid imagination  or whatnot,  because that,  I was fucking puking. 
[02:29:00]  Big measuring cup  full of man cum  and then pouring it  in the frying pan.  Yeah, just thick.  Oh, nice and thick.  And some of the tongue  scrapings got in there  as well.  You know what the  worst part was?  All the, like,  little, like,  darker white  and clear spots  of the jizz  and some of the yellow  where, you know,  it's been backed up  for a while  and it's pissed.  I gotta hang out there.  Yeah, and then  some of it's chunky.  Like, if you drank  a lot of alcohol,  it usually gets chunky.  It gets a little chunky jizz-um. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he hung up.  Oh, well.  What happened?  They could have at least  thrown some hash browns  and some toast  or something with it,  you know?  Yeah, it's all  in the presentation.  Yeah, it really is.  That wasn't plated  very nicely either.  No, no garnish.  Paper plate,  no garnish, right.  A little parsley.  No sprig.  Sprig.  Let's say hi to Paul  in Virginia.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  We absolutely need  to get some dietician  to advocate  this semen diet  because it could work out  great for us  for two reasons. 
[02:30:00]  A, we could start  our own businesses  and B, you know,  there will be women  that want to save money  so they can get it  directly from the source.  Oh, boy.  He's trying a little  too hard.  I didn't even know  what you said.  No, no.  That's all right.  That's what he said.  Yeah, it's just  a fucking screeching hole.  Did I get a car crash?  Oh.  Well, all right.  Get out of here.  You're just a tool.  Yes.  There was a pubis story  I wanted to talk about.  Hey, what happened?  It's not in front of me. 
[02:30:30]  I remember that one.  You brought it up this morning  and we were going to  chat about it.  Where, where,  there's no one in here.  Why isn't E-Rock coming?  Everyone disappeared.  Why doesn't Eric come in?  But he's all reliable.  At least I can count on Danny.  No, I had a...  Like, he's not here  and nothing gets set up?  What's that about?  No, it was my fault.  I had a little issue  with a company  that will not stop  calling me today  and yesterday  and last week  so I'm losing my mind  trying to get a company.  Oh, really?  This fucking...  Hospice?  I really want to lose my mind on it.  Comeomlet.com?  No.  Well, you owe somebody? 
[02:31:00]  No, but they think I do.  It was just,  to make a long story short,  it's this gym member.  Yeah, I know.  This gym membership  that I had back in the day.  You're still fucking around  with this gym membership?  I'm so fucking with these people  they won't stop calling me.  What company is it?  It's the New York Sports Club  and it's not even them  because they're not  really the problem.  It's the company  that they're working with  that do their collections.  It's a company called NARS.  National Asset Recovery Services.  They're based in Missouri.  Please take that information  and do what you will.  Of course.  They've made my life  like a living hell  for the past week and a half 
[02:31:30]  and they did the same thing  to me last year too.  With the same thing?  Same thing.  So you told them,  do you get names?  They give you fake names.  The first time...  You know, I didn't pay them  and now they won't  leave me the fuck alone.  Yeah, but that's the thing though.  It wasn't even...  I wasn't even the billing...  The person responsible  for the billing.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  But because my name is on it,  they just don't listen to me.  These people,  they threaten my credit.  They go,  they go,  we want your routing number  and your checking account.  And I'm like,  no, I'm not giving you that.  They go like,  well...  I just gave it to a Nigerian show.  And they all have Caribbean accents 
[02:32:00]  and they go,  well, you know,  I hope you like your credit rating  because it's going to drop a lot  because we'll ruin your credit  if you don't pay us.  And I was like, try it.  How much do you owe them?  They say I owe them  like 180 bucks.  180 bucks?  But it's not even me.  Like, first of all,  the person that was responsible  for the billing,  like, they took care of this  a year ago.  Money was paid.  Like, there were records  I could find.  And then they just call you again  two years later  or a year later.  Did you give me  a social security number?  Of course.  I mean, I have to...  Then they can mess up your credit.  No, when you filled out  the application, no.  You know what?  I don't know.  Because if they have it,  they can fuck up your credit.  If they don't,  they can't do anything for you.  Like, I'm so glad 
[02:32:30]  that the other studio  in the back  is soundproof  because, like,  I was literally screaming.  You can probably hear it  that I was screaming  at the top of my lungs.  There's something new  going on, too.  Somebody calls our house  all the time  trying to extend  the warranty on a car  I don't own anymore.  And I keep trying to tell them  I don't have this car  and we just stop calling.  I've done a lot  of erroneous calls myself.  And we said, like,  you can't...  You know,  we want to be on  the no-call list  and all this stuff.  And they just openly laugh  and then hang up on you.  And then they call back  the next day. 
[02:33:00]  No-call list?  Shut up.  And anyone else getting this  where they openly laugh  like, yeah,  trying to stop us  from calling?  Well, that's exactly  what's happening.  And I don't owe them  money nothing.  They're just trying  to get this warranty  extended that I don't  have anymore.  Every single call,  I start out,  very nice,  oh, okay,  I was like,  I've tried to explain  this to a few  of your representatives  before,  and, you know,  midway through,  because they interrupt  you every six seconds,  well, Mr. Ross,  you says here  that you are us,  and by the end of it,  I'm like,  will you listen to me?  Listen to me! 
[02:33:30]  And then they just  hang up,  and it's like,  hello?  They're not there anymore.  This is ten times,  like, I'm not exaggerating,  ten times in the last  five days.  You want to bring a suit  against them for harassment?  I would love to.  Yeah, start taping them.  I would love to.  But the new thing is,  they now laugh at you,  because they know  there's nothing we could do.  I had a problem  with some firm,  I think it was like  a sprinkler company  or some shit,  and I owed them  about 250 bucks,  and they hadn't sent me bill. 
[02:34:00]  I always,  whenever I get my bills,  I fucking pay them.  So I finally got a bill  and paid the fucking thing,  and then I get another bill  from them for 250 bucks,  and I think it's a new bill,  so I just fucking fill out a check  and send it out.  So I paid them a couple of times,  and then I get a collection agency  calling me up saying  I owe them $250,  this sprinkler company,  and I go,  I paid them,  and the guy was so condescending  on the phone.  Yes, Mr. Kumia,  we hear that a lot.  We paid.  The fact of the matter is,  their records show, 
[02:34:30]  if you could show proof  that you paid them,  then we'd be happy to,  but as of now,  you didn't pay them,  and I'm like,  motherfucker,  I think I paid them twice.  That's what I said.  And then I went back,  and all my bank statements  found the checks,  faxed them right over to him,  and he called up,  and he wouldn't even apologize  or anything.  He goes,  I'll send these right off  to the company,  because obviously it was  an error on their part.  Like, he wouldn't even  fucking take it.  Everybody is an N-word.  Everyone's an N-word 
[02:35:00]  when you are being called  by those people.  That's it.  And it's always someone  who's been in the country  like six seconds.  Yeah.  Or not even,  because a lot of times  these places will outsource  their call centers.  This one lady I got  on the phone,  I did some research  on the company  because I want to know  who's harassing me,  so I find that they have  call centers in Jamaica  and Panama.  Of course.  So I get a Caribbean  accent on the phone,  and I'm like,  where do you call me  from, Jamaica?  And she just goes,  she goes,  why, because I have  a Caribbean accent?  I'm like, yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Damn, he must,  it must suck  to get Danny  on the phone.  Dude, I just,  I get it.  I mean, I used to work  at call centers,  not for collections  or anything,  but I know how difficult  it could be,  so I get it,  and I try to have patience  with these people,  but they just refuse  to listen.  Fuck them.  You know?  Hey, the warranty thing  is a popular one.  Crotch Crill,  what's going on?  Hey, Opie,  dude, I feel for you, man.  I get those calls  all the time.  This is your second notice  that your car warranty  is about to expire.  Oh, I'm up to the,  I'm up to the final notice, 
[02:36:00]  and the final notice  phone call has been  going on for six months,  so it's not,  it's not that final.  Scam.  I don't even,  I don't even own my car,  my wife,  my car's in my wife's name,  and as soon as I find out  that it's not my name  they're calling about,  dude, it's nothing  but cunts and donkey fuckers  and everything.  But they laugh,  because I say,  look, I'm going to report you,  I'm going to put you  on the no call,  and they just laugh  and hang up,  like there's nothing  you can do to me.  I'm going to try  to hook something up  where I can record,  thank you, Iraq,  where I'm going to record, 
[02:36:30]  you all right?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What happens?  You're going to?  No, every call.  No, stop it.  You're going to invent  something like that?  Yes.  You're a madman  for even thinking  of the concept.  Record a phone call?  You're going to put  that little cup thing  on the suction cup  on your phone?  I was waiting so much.  I was waiting  for you to come out  with that  so I could just  bash you with it,  and then you froze.  I'm going to come up with... 
[02:37:00]  No, not come up with...  And then you're like  a guy from The Happening  ready to kill yourself.  No, I wasn't...  I wasn't coming up with it.  I mean, I'm going to  hook it up  because I have one  that I bought  a long time ago  which is supposed  to record into your...  your...  your...  laptop.  And it doesn't work,  so I have to get  a new way to record.  Phone calls.  It's very easy.  Go to Radio Shack.  80 bucks.  They're all cassette ones.  You put it in,  you hook it right up  to your phone,  and you transfer it 
[02:37:30]  from cassette to CD.  That's what we do  for those telemarketer CDs.  We do.  We still do.  Yeah, old school.  But are they good  with the cordless phone,  or no?  No, you got a wire one.  Hey, speaking of phones,  I was watching  King of Comedy  over the weekend  for the 25th time,  probably,  and they tried  to trace the call.  Why in the old days  it took so long  to trace a call?  Do you know anything  about this, Ann?  I don't know.  I think it was  for drama purposes.  And they always  would hang up... 
[02:38:00]  One number at a time.  It's like,  we almost got it.  They always would run  in the room and go,  oh, we almost had it.  Like the number  somewhere on a screen  somewhere is coming up  like a slot machine.  Yeah, there's one.  There's another number.  We have an area code.  What's the logic in that?  I'll tell you exactly what.  Because it was sent out...  Pings were sent out.  Oh, here you go.  You start laughing.  Gary, you fucking idiot.  You just fucking pings.  I had a good idea, too.  But in King of Comedy...  I'd never have believed you.  King of Comedy,  it seemed like  a 10-minute conversation 
[02:38:30]  at the end.  Oh, we almost had him.  We almost had him.  Keep him on the phone longer.  Oh, we gotta keep him  on the phone longer.  Yeah, it had to be  at least like a minute  or something like that  or three minutes.  And there's always  five guys in suits  and headphones on  and holding him  close to their ears.  And then the bad guy  right at the end  would go,  by the way,  I know you're tracing  this call.  Click.  Oh, we almost had him.  Damn it.  And there's always the guy  that gives the signal  like it's him, it's him.  Listen.  And so he picks up  the phone really slow  like it's not gonna  make a sound.  He's not gonna hear  the click, click.  I always tried to pick up  the extension in my house 
[02:39:00]  when my brother  was on the phone  and eavesdrop in  on what he's listening to.  It'll be,  never work.  Click, click.  Hang up the fucking phone,  you asshole.  Like, oh, shit.  Fuck, it works in the movies.  Yeah, but the dummy  making the call  doesn't hear 10 people  picking up their receivers.  The guy that hits  the big reel-to-reel recorder.  Right.  The villain always knows  exactly how long  this thing is on the phone.  Yes.  He should be the guy  tracing the call.  Don't insult me  by trying to record  this phone call.  Just the dumb thing  I saw during  King of Comedy. 
[02:39:30]  And the old school  shot of Times Square.  Holy crap.  That's always entertaining  to look at.  Everyone forgot  what that place  used to look like.  Just a shithole.  They've seen it  in an old movie.  Right in the Paramount  building.  The main shot  that everyone knows  of Times Square.  The old buses,  the old Coca-Cola sign,  the chock full of nuts sign,  the Panasonic sign,  there was like...  The porn theater.  Yeah.  Now we've got Applebee's  and Chevy's.  Yeah.  Well, now it's  Disney Store.  Yeah.  They like to say that  now it's Disneyland. 
[02:40:00]  I know.  Aw.  Whatever happened  to the good old days,  you can go watch a movie,  fucking poke your dick  through a hole in the wall,  no one knows nothing.  Me and Jim were in a booth  one time in Times Square.  And we were next to each other  and the window came up,  that little window,  you can put your hand through  and grab them  and finger them or whatever.  So we're right next to each other  and there's a mirror  across the way  so you can kind of see  the person.  So I did my business  and I came right away.  And it must be made  so you could see like  the chick's ass too  and shit if she's turned around.  Yeah.  Oh, she puts it right up  to the window  and you can grab her 
[02:40:30]  and you throw her five bucks  or whatever.  So I finished first.  So I'm just,  I'm standing in the booth.  I'm like,  I'll just stay in here.  And I could see Jim  through the mirror  and he's like,  yeah, back up.  And she's like,  what?  He's like, back up.  And I'm looking like that  and she backs her ass up  to like about an inch away  from the opening  and you just see  Jim's tongue come out  and stick it right in her ass.  And she jumps like,  whoa, easy.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  I saw little Jim's egg head  come out of that little bit  with his tongue  and just stick it right in her ass. 
[02:41:00]  Like a baby bird  looking to eat.  I think that was on 54th  and Broadway.  That's where that was.  You can see  the Lion King there now.  Oh, wow.  Is that funny?  Dude, do you know  what fucking fingers  and other shit  have been in her ass?  Whatever.  During the day she's...  What are you,  a communist?  Exactly.  What am I supposed to not  be a fucking gentleman?  Yeah, what are you?  A gentleman.  Sorry, I had a moment  of clarity there.  Yeah, fucking  beautiful fucking ass. 
[02:41:30]  Beautiful ass.  Dude, I used to eat ass  in that 54th.  Lutheran?  What's up?  It was the 54th  and Broadway  and you used to be able  to touch their ashes  and through the window  and I ate a lot  of asses in that place  because it was  the fucking face height  with the...  But why would you,  like...  Why wouldn't you?  Weren't you scared  of a bad ass thing?  No!  No!  Fuck.  Certainly wasn't.  Yeah, and those boots  are brutal  because, you know,  you don't look down  when you get in there  because it's just loads  all over the floor.  Oh, fuck.  You know what I mean? 
[02:42:00]  That's the key.  Like an outlet.  I remember one time  I was in a booth  with a girl on the phone  and I was walking  under a tree.  I was probably in there  for like 20 minutes.  I couldn't get off  for some reason.  She's on the phone.  I'm telling her what to do.  Finally, at least 20 minutes  I'm in there.  I'm like, all right,  I pull my pants up.  I get to leave  and my sneakers  are like stuck to the floor.  So I just said,  you know what?  Fuck this.  I just untied them  and walked out of my socks.  I left them.  I'm like, there's too many...  The idea of them  having to maybe untie  and then tie your laces,  there isn't some magic 
[02:42:30]  fucking cleansing shit  from walking  that gets that shit  off your laces  so when you're tying your laces  it's just guy cum  all over your fucking hands.  That's why I don't even like  walking around in the city  and then you untie your shoes.  It's like all that city gack  is on your fucking laces.  And then you have to put  the laces in your mouth.  Oh, you suck on them.  To get them moist  to put it through the hole there  so you can retie your shoes.  No, I just suck on my laces  when I get home.  Lick the fucking treads clean.  It's like sucking  on those honeysuckles  when you were a kid.  Delicious. 
[02:43:00]  Get a little treat.  What's Jimmy doing?  Paying his bills over there?  No, I got it.  Oh, what do you got?  I got some  death videos.  A fan sent me  Faces of Death  which a lot of these are fake.  The original, yeah.  Some of them are real  but a lot of them are fake  but it's on Blu-ray.  The only real ones  and the one that  fucking put it's on Blu-ray  it doesn't matter.  It's like fucking  it's like taking  a high definition camcorder  and taping an episode  of fucking  My Mother the Car  off the TV.  You can then say  look, it's in high def.  I got to take that  off a high def camera  but the original 
[02:43:30]  Master is shit.  Well, thank you  to the guy who sent it.  No, because he's a cunt.  He really is.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?  Hey, thanks for nothing  you bag of shit.  Either send the entire box set  or don't waste  everyone's time.  No, thank you, man.  You know what I didn't like  about Faces of Death  that creeped me out?  No, men stuck in  each other's cocks.  Yes.  That's what I hated.  Yes.  That was kind of  the first thing you saw  that was really grotesque  and the initial  desensitizing  of seeing dead things  and stuff.  It was, I think it was 
[02:44:00]  I forgot which airline it was  PSA or one of those  that crashed in California  and they showed body parts  on the roofs of houses  and shit  and in the streets  and that fucked me up  because I knew that was real  because it was news footage  and stuff  and that I couldn't even watch  but the monkey brain thing  I knew was fake  and the fucking  electrocution is fake.  Yeah.  That's fake.  The guy getting eaten  by the fucking lion  or something  and it's filmed by another car  and then it turns into  a three camera Desi Arnaz shoot  from one car.  It's like, 
[02:44:30]  get the fuck out of here.  How about the one,  I don't think it's in part one  where the guy is,  I told you,  the guy is trapped  between the subway platform  and the train  and he's alive.  But as soon as they move  the subway car  he's going to die.  Yeah,  they don't show them moving it  but he's kind of like  propped up on his elbow.  He's got to be embarrassed.  And there's like  a three in space.  He's just kind of like,  hey, how you doing?  Yeah,  he kind of looks almost  a feminine,  hello.  And there's paramedics there  and I think they have  like an oxygen mask  over his face  and they're keeping him there  because they're bringing down  his wife or somebody 
[02:45:00]  to say goodbye  because as soon as they move  the subway car.  That's like signs.  He's,  yeah,  but it's real footage  and his body's all twisted up  like a tourniquet.  They couldn't have possibly  just pulled the subway away  and let him spin like a top  as the fucking thing pulls out.  Well,  you wouldn't spin,  you just would bleed out.  I mean.  I would think they would take  some type of pneumatic devices,  put it in there  and push the train away  and pull them out.  Well,  that's what they do.  They don't drive the subway away.  That's what I assumed  you were talking about.  Oh,  no,  I don't know.  How silly would that be  to see him just going, 
[02:45:30]  whoa,  as he's spinning.  Like,  he'll be all right.  Pelvis is coming out  his asshole.  No,  that's,  no,  no,  no,  that's what they,  the train has stopped.  They probably push it away  from the platform.  Yeah,  that's what I would think.  When they push it away,  the tourniquet action that,  like,  because you're twisted up.  Yeah,  all the blood pressure  goes out of your head  and upper body  and you're just dead.  Just drained.  Can we have,  can we look that up,  why don't they just put  tight pants on him  beforehand?  I don't know, 
[02:46:00]  a belt perhaps?  Yeah,  a belt.  Can we live like that?  Maybe just have a little  living room around the subway?  Yeah.  Give him a hat.  Really,  I'm fine.  Don't move the train.  Just ruin it for everybody else  so you can live your life.  I bet they don't do that.  Probably not.  It'd be so hard  to keep the area clean.  Inconvenient.  I want to see.  Right,  enough of the Benny Hill music.  We got it.  We're going to do 45 minutes  of the entire episode  in real time.  I just noticed something.  We got Tim Florentine  and Don Jameson in the studio.  Look how polite they are.  They got their food  and they just are waiting 
[02:46:30]  to eat it.  What?  These,  well these,  I'm part of that.  We all just eat  live on the show.  We'll take a break though.  It's not because of that.  I got an egg white omelet.  Oh,  yeah.  I'm still deciding  if I'm going to eat it  or not.  Long day to pick the egg white omelet.  Because you know  as soon as you put it  in your mouth,  you're going to be like,  what a second?  I already looked at it.  It was a little chunky.  Oh,  shit.  No,  that's bad.  I see some clear stuff  on the top.  Yeah,  well.  And Kenny picked it up  so who knows what he did  with fucking hairs.  Probably put his  ghoulish little penis. 
[02:47:00]  I think Kenny has  like a five and a half  inch dick.  That's my opinion.  You think it's  a little blow average?  I think it's big.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah,  like a club.  He's a big guy though.  I know.  That's why I think  he wears tighty-whities  and I guess he,  I think he has  maybe five and three quarters  fairly thin.  I was able to  sire children.  What about the nips?  I see them with  big areolas.  Kenny?  Yeah.  Oh,  big like bologna  type tits.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Big areolas.  Big suckable  knuckle nipples.  Good news,  the Dow's only down  200 in the first call.  Oh, great.  And this DHL thing  is ruining a little  town called Wilmington.  So that's where  they're all out of.  I don't live there.  They say it's  destroying the town.  Destroying.  7,000 people from  one town being  laid off.  My town's number  one export is Jews.  So it doesn't matter  to me.  I don't care. 
[02:48:00]  I got my nice  neighborhood.  As long as I can  keep it.  Keep my house.  When do we feel  the trickle down effect  of all these people  being laid off  where you're dodging  bricks and muggers  in the street  because they need to  It's going to get  ugly, yeah.  Because they need to  feed their families  and themselves.  They're cutting the  budget here in New York  City so bad.  But Bloomberg says,  no, we don't want it  to go back to like  the 70s where  everything, the  infrastructure pretty  much was just  crumbling.  It's like, well,  have you ever played  Sim City?  There were any of  those games? 
[02:48:30]  The second you start  pulling away the  maintenance people  and the lower  echelon, that's  when things start  going to shit.  All of a sudden,  I realized I was  playing Sim City  and then I'm  running out of  money and shit  and everything  was going good.  I'm like, I'm  the best city  maker ever.  And then I had  to pull back on  a few things and  then I noticed  half my city's on  fire and then  there's a riot on  another side and  I don't have cops  to send them there  because I cut that.  That game is very  realistic.  It really is.  What's going to  happen in a lot of  towns and cities  across America?  Sim Amusement Park  was the same thing. 
[02:49:00]  I'm like, why do I  need people there  sweeping?  I have too many  sweepers.  I'm going to take  them away.  And then papers  started gathering  on the sidewalks  and then the  customers walking  around with the  little thing over  their head going  grumbling and it  says, your park  is dirty.  So they weren't  happy even when  they're going on  the ride.  So then the  happiness level  goes down and  now people aren't  showing up and  now you can't pay  for maintenance on  your machines and  then they're flying  off the roller  coasters.  So you have to  keep sweeping.  That's what we  learned today.  Keep fucking  sweeping.  It all starts with 
[02:49:30]  the sweeping.  We're so doomed as  a society.  It's going to get  real.  I was just  watching the  footage of our  president-elect.  He's the  miracle maker.  Wait for the  miracles.  He's the  messiah.  Now we wait for  the miracles.  You wanted the  job and now you  got it,  motherfucker.  Good luck to  you.  He's on his  little honeymoon  period right now.  The wife is  like, wow, this is  great.  This is where the  kids are going to  stay.  This is where the  Kennedy children  stay.  They're going to be  in the same  rooms and  everything.  It's like, yeah,  great.  It just figures it's 
[02:50:00]  going to be nice.  It's the worst  time to be the  president of the  United States and  finally the black  guy gets in.  Yeah.  The scapegoat.  He's going to be the  scapegoat.  They're pretty much  saying it's the  worst time to be the  president.  Yeah, it is.  All right, well, you  know what?  Here you go.  Everything is  fucked.  There isn't one  thing going well  right now for this  country.  Economically, it  stinks.  We're still in a  war.  Yeah, the  fucking we're at  each other's  throats.  It's just it's a  horrible time to  come in as 
[02:50:30]  president.  And here he is.  Hi, I'm your  first black  president.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  There's going to  be pitchforks and  fucking torches out  in front of the  White House after  like two months.  When did it?  Come on out here,  boy.  When do people  realize that he  can't change this  shit anytime soon?  March, April.  He's already  saying it.  Yeah.  It's the first  day, first day in.  He's like, OK, I  can't fix it now.  Hold his his  entire detailed  agenda off of his  website, which was  there during his  campaign and just  put the vagaries 
[02:51:00]  that are usually  hey, prosperity,  happiness, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  Great.  Hope, hope, hope.  We've got a lot of  hope.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take  a quick break so  these guys could  think about eating  their omelets.  Enjoy your  omelets.  At least I'll put  ketchup on it.  My hash browns  look like they're  from someone's ass.  Hey, surprise.  And when we get  back, the broads  out there, they're  doing some stuff  with their pubic  area, pubic  fashion after the  break.  Can I answer a  question?  No!  You're right.  What? 
[02:51:30]  Some fucking  guy keeps texting  me.  Why?  He's like, when  are you in  Atlantic City at  the Bogota?  I said January  16, 17.  Oh, God.  God almighty,  thebogota.com.  How many  fucking times?  Let me cancel  the next text.  Why didn't you  just text him  that?  Why did you  have to say it  on the air?  Yeah, you're  confused.  I mean, like you  could have just  texted him back.  Just in case other  people wanted to  text me.  Oh, is that why  you did that?  Food!  All right!  Give out your  number. 
[02:52:00]  Give out your  number.  I want to see how  many text messages  you get in five  minutes.  917-267-2602.  I did that on  Eddie Trunk's show  last night.  I did the Boneyard  with him, and I  wanted a plug for  comics this weekend.  So I go, yeah.  And Yngwie Malmsteen  was coming in.  He was right out  in the lobby.  I go, yeah, Yngwie  said he's going to  see me this weekend  at Comics, the club  in New York City.  And he's like, he's  going to be out of  town.  He's leaving tomorrow.  I go, no.  He goes, really?  And Yngwie comes in.  He goes, Yngwie, you  going to his comedy  show?  And he's like, what?  What comedy show?  I go, remember at  Comics you were 
[02:52:30]  talking?  I don't remember  that.  I had to get the  fucking plug in.  He fell for it.  Fucking Eddie Trunk.  What's wrong with  you, Eddie?  Jim Florentine,  Comics This Weekend.  We'll continue.  We'll be right back. 
[02:53:00]  Ah, Hopi and Anthony,  Jim Florentine, Don  Jameson.  Cafe Pacific.  What is that about?  We're talking about  airlines and my manager, 
[02:53:30]  Jonathan, the fucking  arms dealer, has flown  everywhere in the world  and he gets upgraded a lot  because he has so many  miles.  He's just a weirdo who  travels alone.  And he said the best  planes, the most  luxurious ones are  Cafe Pacific.  Really?  We're a Cafe Pacific.  But he also told us a  story where he's on  planes with like animals.  He's flown.  What he's doing like  the little jumps.  He's flown everywhere.  Yeah.  If you knew the  fucking people that he  introduced to Fidel Castro 
[02:54:00]  in Cuba, he's fucking  Jonathan, we got to get  him on the show.  He's a fucking very  interesting.  Hyman Roth?  Yes.  I'm an old Jew.  Take the cake, show  everybody, and then give  everyone a slice.  What's wrong with you?  He's been fucking  everywhere, dude.  All right.  We're going to go right  bigger than U.S.  steel.  You know what he does  too?  He's fucking Jonathan.  You ever see his  scrapbooks?  He does scrapbooks?  He's like a giant child.  My fucking.  This is the guy who 
[02:54:30]  handles my career.  He showed me in his  apartment his scrapbooks,  but they're like probably  about a foot and a half  high and a foot wide.  They're like giant  like construction paper  scrapbooks.  They're able to tape  matchbooks in them from  other countries and it's  like the I've never had  the urge to rip something  as badly.  Like one of the matches  books on fire.  That's holding burn.  One of the matches  books?  One of the matches  books.  I always like to  pluralize the wrong 
[02:55:00]  part.  And I always ask him,  did you get laid over  there?  He's like, that wasn't  what the trip was about.  I'm like, why go?  That's what every trip's  about.  Why go?  What do you want to do?  Just show that massive  scrotum off in a fucking.  What does he got?  A big scrotum?  Dude, it's fucking.  Big bag?  It's like a water  balloon.  Whatever he has in the  front of his.  Does he have a problem?  It's fucking.  His dick has down  syndrome.  Yeah, he wears tight  pants.  You look at his bulge?  Yeah, I've seen it.  You can't not look at  his bulge.  Is it the ball bag you 
[02:55:30]  think or has he got  something else going on?  Dude, it's fucking, it  looks like, I'm opening  my hands, like my  fingers.  It's a fucking, it's  like a small, like  riverbed.  Cocoa orbs?  It's gigantic.  I don't know if that's  his dick or his bag.  It's fucking awful.  I think it's his bag.  Maybe he's got big  balls.  Because Jim was, it  was Jim's manager first  and I was going to meet  with him.  He goes, you got to  check out his package.  And the first time  meeting a fucking guy  in Hollywood, yeah, I'm  just staring at his  package.  I knew fucking Jim.  He's like, what's  your plan for your  career? 
[02:56:00]  I'm like, I don't know.  I'm being hypnotized  by your balls.  I'm trying to text Jim.  I'm like, it's fucking  huge.  We used to know this  comic named Paul  Veneer.  Remember Paul Veneer?  Yeah.  He does a music parody  act and stuff, a lot of  crowd work.  We knew Paul for years  but his fucking package,  it's all we could look  at.  We couldn't stop  staring at him.  As soon as we were  done with our sets  opening for him, we'd  try to sit in the front  and just stare at his  package and just giggle.  He thought we were  laughing at his jokes.  Which he was a funny 
[02:56:30]  dude, but that package.  It's all he could look  at.  We'd always ask him,  you gotta tell us how  fucking big it is.  He was like, all  uncomfortable.  Come on, fellas.  Yeah.  No guy wants the  openers to ask that  question.  What is it?  The pants?  What do you think it  is?  I don't know.  The pants that does  that?  Is it how you position?  What am I doing right  now?  I'm doing like the  split on the seam with  the balls.  Right down the middle,  right?  And then the up and a  little to my left kind  of a thing. 
[02:57:00]  It's comfortable.  Some guys, though, you  look over and both balls  are on one side and  that'll fuck it up.  That'll make it look  like, wow, what's going  on over there?  Yeah, it looks like the  movie Twins, Schwarzenegger  and DeVito.  Yeah.  And then on the other  side, like a mac and  cheese noodle.  Like a Rolling  Stones cover.  Yeah, kind of over to  that side.  All right.  I don't know.  Speaking of packages,  the girls are doing  some fun stuff.  Images everything in  Southern California. 
[02:57:30]  And everyone always  wants to look their  best, even if it's a  body area that only a  precious few will ever  see.  Lou Parker live at one  salon where they, let's  see, they style hair down  there.  How's that?  Yeah, guys, this is  an interesting.  Nice, sexy laugh she's  got there.  Hair down there.  Clever.  Down there on the  feet, on toe knuckles.  Yeah, guys, this is  an interesting one.  It's one of those ones  we've been talking  about for weeks now.  We're tonight at 
[02:58:00]  Damone Roberts.  It's a salon in  Beverly Hills.  Hey, Damone!  We're at Damone  Roberts.  Isn't this great?  Where'd you get that  pussy, out of the  hamper?  Damone Roberts.  Ross, stupid Damone.  No matter what the  pussy looks like, make  it seem like that's the  place to be.  Hey, isn't this great?  What tickets were it? 
[02:58:30]  It's cheap trick and...  I was selling those and  then...  Earth, Wind & Fire.  Earth, Wind & Fire and  Little Brother.  Little Brother, right.  He's a great looking  kid.  Damone was great in that.  What an ass.  Damone Roberts.  It's a salon in Beverly  Hills.  It's really nice.  And they carry this  product.  It's called Betty Beauty.  And basically, Betty, if  you don't know what that  is, and I'm not going to  tell you, I'm just going to  show you, it's for that  area right there, because we  are on the news.  The woman who created this 
[02:59:00]  said she wanted to call it  Betty.  She wanted it to have sort of  an old Hollywood theme, sort  of like Ava Gardner, Betty,  and it has become wildly  popular.  So tonight, on this Friday  night, we are getting our  Bettys ready.  That sounds so unsexy.  Hopefully you'll have sex with  a guy named Mercury,  Freddy.  Betty.  Get your Betty ready.  That is so unsexy.  That's what the cougars do.  My Betty's ready, is it? 
[02:59:30]  Looks like a fucking punched  mouth with a fucking scrappy  little beard.  With no teeth.  Like Betty Davis after the  stroke.  My Betty's ready.  It's drooling.  Ladies, you've got to keep  your hair down there in tip  top shape.  Waxing it away.  What the hell was that?  Sounds like she got  punched.  Yeah.  Punched in the Betty.  Me, you, Betty, Betsy's  Betty.  Baby maker, why don't 
[03:00:00]  pop it?  Top shape.  Waxing it away.  Nothing new.  But this is.  Today, I'm getting my  Betty dyed hot pink.  Yes, you heard her right.  Hot pink and in the shape  of a bow.  Who wants that?  Shave it all off, you  fucking idiot.  I'm getting it all shaved  off and I'm getting a baby  bonnet.  That's fucking enraging. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, her Betty.  Yeah.  That is a horrible fucking  term for that.  It's just, that might have  been good in World War II.  What's wrong with the  names we got?  That's right.  What's all those names for  the cunt?  Cunt.  Beef carton.  Yeah.  Hole.  Pleasure divot.  Whale's eyes.  Whale's eyes.  Arby sandwich.  Arby sandwich. 
[03:01:00]  Arby sandwich.  Nice.  Sweet.  Dina Zelyoni is one of  many women who are daring  to spice up their bikini  line.  And Damone Robert's  Salon in Beverly Hills is  giving them the opportunity.  It is like having a  secret.  A special secret.  Only your rapist knows.  Yeah.  A special secret.  Yeah, she has it shaved  into the shape of a mace  can. 
[03:01:30]  Yuck.  The process is pretty  simple.  A quick application of  breaching cream to prep  the hair.  Then 20 minutes later,  it's time for color.  And girls, we've got  choices.  Blue, auburn, purple,  hot pink, blonde, and  even red and green.  Just in time for the  holidays.  It's also really good for  a woman who is older and  have gray hair.  So we can use brown and  black because nobody  wants to see gray hair  down there.  Oh, they're dying gray  snatches.  Oh, God. 
[03:02:00]  Just shave it.  Those hairs are like  Brillo.  Big coarse grays.  What do you think?  Dying it pink is going to  fucking help?  I thought they said time  for the colored.  No, the colors.  Oh, the colors.  Yes.  Imagine if a colored one  had gray hair because  it's already coarse enough.  Yeah.  It would just.  It would be brutal.  It would be like kissing  Mother Jefferson.  You want more of this 
[03:02:30]  crowd?  Of course.  I want to know everything  about the Bettys.  All right.  Brides come in and get  blue done for that  tradition.  Something barbed,  something blue.  And why not charm your  Betty using these little  stencil shapes?  We hear men love it  in the shape of a heart.  No.  We don't.  No, we don't.  It never looks right.  Looks ridiculous.  Looks silly.  Unless it's an actual  biological heart.  Yeah.  Try that one out.  That's kind of nice.  Usually they leave too  much space between the  hair and the... 
[03:03:00]  The hair and the pussy  thing.  When they stand up,  it looks fine.  Right.  And then laying back  with their legs up,  it's like someone dropped  a fucking little bit of  hair in the middle of  their belly.  Right.  Because it's so far  from the actual pussy.  What's that about?  Yeah.  Like a happy trail.  Yeah.  Like the Hitler mustache  is the worst.  It looks okay kind of  when they're standing up.  Little tuft,  whatever.  But then laying back  with their legs spread,  it's between their pussy  and their belly button.  It's like you forgot.  What is this? 
[03:03:30]  What do I do?  Seek high on this thing?  Yeah.  Who dropped this  fucking thing?  Heart.  Heart is the best.  We'll go on Thursday.  It's a big surprise.  Yeah.  There's also a peace sign,  lightning bolt,  butterfly,  cat,  star,  and even a dollar sign.  What?  There's a little devil  that's also fun.  But getting back  to the wax.  For the first time,  I would say it's a little  bit of pain,  but it's fleeting pain.  It's a little more  sensitive down there. 
[03:04:00]  It's like a rubber  bounce snap.  Over.  And over.  And over again.  But Dina doesn't  seem to mind.  She wants a beautiful  Betty no matter what.  And in the end,  she says it makes you  feel, well,  a little clean,  a little dirty.  Yeah.  She would have  fucking there  to have it shaved  in the shape  of a tuna can.  You want to feel dirty?  Take it up to shitter. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to shave  my Bartholomew.  I'll show them.  Give it a nice  sexy name.  This is a dumb  Sex in the City  segment.  2008.  Exactly.  Stupid Sex in the City  crap.  Made every old  bitch think  they're going out  there and scoring.  Right.  What do you mean?  Stop it already.  It's the news.  Yeah.  It's not some  stupid Sex in the City  stuff.  You know,  they're doing  another fucking  Sex in the City  movie.  Yeah.  Because it did  so well that  they're making  another one.  I actually have  the plot for the  I actually have 
[03:05:00]  gotten the script.  Oh, Jimmy.  Do tell.  Sarah Jessica Parker  in the opening  scene is in  a doctor's office  because she thinks  she's pregnant.  Oh, nice.  But he says,  I've got some  bad news.  Oh, no.  You have rectal  cancer.  Oh, my Jiminy Cricket.  That doesn't sound  good.  Yes, they actually  cut her asshole  out in the whole  rest of the film.  It's her learning  to shit without  an asshole.  And her friends  are only in the  second scene.  They go to the  hospital and she  gives them all the  creeps and they  leave.  Yeah, she's got  like the Louis  Vuitton  Colossomy bag.  And a big ball 
[03:05:30]  on her leg  because she  has no hair  left.  She's eating  out of a bag  of oats.  That's the plot  of the new  one.  Okay.  I'd go see  that.  That I'll see.  Of course.  What's her  Betty look like?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You can't see it  because there's  a black orderly  on her at all  times.  Every time she  wants to eat,  he fucks her  while he pushes  Jell-O into her  mouth.  Busta Rhymes 
[03:06:00]  is playing  the orderly.  You've got to  bring in the  black audience.  Now I'm  watching that.  That's like the  slapstick comedy  part.  He fucking  punches her  right in that  fucking Clydesdale  face.  Climbs on and  fucks her and  pushes fucking  green jelly in  her mouth.  Dice has a  funny bit about  Sarah Jessica  Park.  She goes,  she's been  fucked so many  times her pussy  looks like  Rocky's eye.  Keith 
[03:06:30]  Oberman fans.  He's terrific.  I can't get  enough of this  guy.  That guy really  tells it like it  is.  He just signed a  new deal and I'm  glad.  It gives us more  time to make fun of  this douche.  He really is.  I didn't even mind  him that much until  he came out against  Imus after the fact.  And then David  Schuster.  He's a lunk-headed  cunt.  He had to tell  his audience that  behind the scenes he  was telling everybody  this isn't right.  And our whole point  was you have a  fucking national show. 
[03:07:00]  Why don't you go on  your show in the  middle of this  controversy and tell  people it's not  right.  He was bragging  after the fact.  Oh, I was one of  those guys behind  closed doors saying  we need to fire this  guy.  To Jesse Jackson.  He was groveling.  That fucking douchebag  Jesse Jackson.  It was sickening.  Sickening.  Well, he did a thing  on the gay marriage  thing that got  shot down in  California.  Wasn't he updating  scores a few weeks  ago?  Yeah.  Now he's an expert 
[03:07:30]  in gay marriage.  Well, he was the  ESPN guy and that's  actually when I did  like him.  He did a very good  job at the sports  thing and then he's  doing his MSNBC show  but now NBC, I think  on Sunday nights,  they put him back.  Highlights.  Him and Dan Patrick  back together.  Yeah, doing some  highlights on NBC.  Dan Patrick's great.  He's phenomenal.  But they put him  together like everyone's  going to be like,  oh, remember 10 years  ago?  We're going to watch  Football Night in  America, which is the  fucking worst title ever.  What's it called?  It's Football Night in  America.  That's fucking horrendous.  Every Sunday night.  I know.  Football Night in  America. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Why in America?  Where the fuck?  It's the only country  they played in, you  fucking asshole.  That name's as bad as  Special Delivery with  Sam and Dave.  Football Night in  America.  Excuse me.  No, but it really is  the name of a show.  Oh, okay.  Can you take that  back?  Our own Sam doing a  show at Eastside Dave  and their show's called  Special Delivery with  Sam and Dave.  Why would you plug that?  Because it's our boy Sam.  Who cares?  Exactly.  Sam, the name stinks.  That hair.  Name stinks.  Enough already.  I want to put a fucking 
[03:08:30]  football helmet face mask  through that.  I think the name Sam and  Dave was taken.  Oh.  You didn't want to get  sued by Sam and Dave?  What are they doing  these days?  Somebody who knows  them probably.  What do they ever do?  What was their hit song?  I don't even remember.  Hold on, I'm coming.  I'm a soul man.  If their name's really  Sam and Dave.  You could say Sam and Dave.  You could say the Sam and  Dave show.  Why don't you just call it  Sam and Dave on your radio  dial?  It's a real name.  Because it's a wrestling  thing.  You like the wrestling thing.  It's not like the Coke and 
[03:09:00]  Pepsi show.  But we don't want to name it  the Sam and Dave show.  We would want to name it  Sam and Dave.  So now, because the blank  show.  I don't know.  We didn't want to put the  show in it.  Oh, like the Opie and  Anthony show, right?  Yeah.  Stupid and lame.  No, no, no.  The thing is.  Plus the fucking tools.  Yeah, sorry about that.  It's been done so well.  We have a lame show.  It's been done so well by you  guys and by the game for our show.  I got you now.  Yeah.  All right.  Get lost.  All right.  Scream.  Well, Keith Olbermann is  talking about the gay marriage  thing. 
[03:09:30]  I didn't know if he should  really leave or not.  It was all awkward.  Football night in America.  It's just how he talks about  subjects that just drive me  nuts.  You want to hear Keith Olbermann  talking about the gay marriage  thing?  Yes.  All right.  This isn't about yelling and  this isn't about politics and  this isn't really just about  Prop 8.  And I don't have a personal  investment in this.  I'm not gay.  I had to strain to think of  one member of even my very  extended family who is.  We get it.  I have no personal stories of  close friends.  What a fucking what a  fucking insecure.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You have to have this 
[03:10:00]  fucking preamble before he  didn't want people to think  why would he defend this?  What is he?  He doesn't tell people he's  not black when he's talking  about black issues.  Yeah.  What a fucking jerk off.  Just be secure with who you  are.  You douche.  You really.  That's like a comic when they  go, you know, I love my wife,  but stop with that.  Just fucking come out and  say it and call her what  you're going to call her.  Ladies, nothing against you  guys, but stop.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Excellent point.  Stop fucking prefacing it, 
[03:10:30]  you faggots.  Just say it.  Yeah, well, this is what  Keith's doing today.  Good family who is.  I have no personal stories  of close friends or  colleagues fighting  prejudice that still  pervades their lives.  And yet to me, this vote  is horrible.  Horrible.  Because this isn't about  yelling and this isn't  about politics.  This is about the human  heart.  And if that sounds horny,  so be it.  And the human penis  meeting each other.  Yes. 
[03:11:00]  The human heart.  The human heart.  Horrible.  If it sounds corny.  Yeah, it does.  It does.  It sounds douchey.  It's worse than corny.  You're a douchebag.  Yeah.  That sounds corny.  So be it.  Wait till we get to  the ember of love line.  Why do you say that?  The member of love?  Right.  What is it to you?  In a time of impermanence  and fly-by-night  relationships,  these people over here  want the same chance 
[03:11:30]  at permanence and  happiness that is your  option.  They don't want to  deny you yours.  They don't want to  take anything away from  you.  They want what you want.  A chance to be a  little less alone in  the world.  Have shitty smelling  dicks.  Well, you think  about it, don't we  all?  Yes.  They want what you  want.  To blow a friend  behind a dumpster  while walking a  small dog.  They want what we  all want.  Six transgendered  partners a night.  He's so dramatic. 
[03:12:00]  They want what we  all want.  Dad, do not vomit  when he looks at us.  Whom in the world.  Only now you are  saying to them, no,  you can't have it on  these terms.  Maybe something  similar if they  behave, if they don't  cause too much  trouble.  You'll even give them  all the same legal  rights even as you  are taking away the  legal right which they  already had.  A world around them  still anchored in love  and marriage and  you're saying, no, you  can't marry. 
[03:12:30]  What if somebody  passed a law that  said you couldn't  marry?  I wish they had  nine fucking years  ago.  How about them?  Oh, or actually  18 years ago.  How many houses  would you have now?  Oh my God.  At least one other  one that I own in  Huntington somewhere  that you've never  seen.  That I've never seen.  And boatloads of  cash.  And if they told us  we couldn't get  married anymore, we'd  we'd figure it out,  right?  Yeah.  Figure something out.  Exactly.  Still, who cares?  Then you call it  something else and 
[03:13:00]  you just fucking make  your own ceremony for  it and you do it and  you fuck each other  they're in the ass.  Right?  What a melodramatic  guys.  Yeah.  Hey, look, you  bring to the choir.  With me?  Of course.  A bunch of fucking  room full of Peter  pumpers.  We're not  communists, of  course, yes.  It's just how he  talks about this.  He's trying, what is  shit to you?  He's so overly dramatic  and like he really  cares about this.  He's trying so hard  to have moments.  Like, he always  tries so hard. 
[03:13:30]  He's such a fucking  annoying douche.  Like, uh, what do you  we are, we apologize  without limit.  You fucking ass.  What are you, Sir John  Gilgall?  Just saying we  apologize is good  enough, but we  apologize.  Without limit.  I have one limit I  wanted on that.  We are dreadfully.  It's like, you  folly, stop trying so  hard to have the  moments.  Stop trying to be  quoted.  Yeah.  Fucking douche.  If this country  hadn't redefined 
[03:14:00]  marriage, black people  still couldn't marry  white people.  16 states have a  lot of world.  Say that you're not  black.  Stress that.  And you have  nothing against black  people.  I love them.  Yes, some of my  best friends.  But, let's face it.  And when was this  wonderful time?  Talking up.  How did this happen?  And they always say  it with good, like,  I love my wife, but  you never hear a  comical, like, you  know, hey, look, I  have affection for  rapists, but.  But, yeah, you  know, I'm not saying  all rapists are bad. 
[03:14:30]  White people.  16 states have laws on  the books, which  made that illegal  in 1967.  1967.  Yeah, I heard you.  Yeah, that was  He loves repeating  stuff.  Yeah, 1967.  Guess what, Keith?  That was a long  time ago, you idiot.  It was a long time  ago.  Three or four  different times.  It's still a long  time ago.  They had to wait  because they couldn't  say, you could put  a man on the moon,  but I can't marry  a white woman.  Yeah.  And then, you know,  a couple of short  years later, they  had to, hold on.  I was trying to 
[03:15:00]  enable that joke,  too.  I was trying to  Yeah, you were.  Thank you.  Waiter, I'll go.  What?  What?  What?  Were you going to  help, like, careening  into the back of my  car?  I was going to say,  waiter, I'll have a  B with a bunch of  O's.  Okay.  No, that's good.  I'm appropriate.  In 1967, the parents  of the president  elected to the  United States could  not have married in  nearly one third of  the states of the 
[03:15:30]  country.  Their son grew up  to leave home.  We understand.  You don't need to  drill it home, you  fucking dummy.  Where's my time  machine DeLorean when  I need it?  He's trying to put  it into terms where  we all go, holy  shit, and it's not  working, asshole.  We get it.  Do you understand  what that means?  We know.  Yeah.  Parents of the  president elected.  Meanwhile, the  father left after  like two years.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What's the difference? 
[03:16:00]  It doesn't matter.  Well, the difference  was he, you know,  was able to get it  in there.  Yeah.  Bill Kaye from  Philly reminds me  that, yes, he does  one of these every  night on some dumb  topic.  But he's trying so  hard to get that  holy shit moment.  He couldn't even be  mad.  Of the country their  son grew up to lead.  Ugh.  But it's worse  than that.  What?  If this country had  not redefined marriage,  some black people  still couldn't marry  other black people.  It is one of the  most...  Is this pussy boy  getting close to 
[03:16:30]  crying over this?  I hope so.  And first of all,  he was talking about  something 40 years.  40 years is a long  fucking time.  Especially those  40 years.  That was a lot of  shit going on during  that time period.  That's a long 40 years.  And now he's going  back to where  black people  couldn't even  marry each other.  So now he's  going back further.  Right.  How far back?  Other black people.  It is one of the  most overlooked  and cruelest parts  of our sad history  of slavery.  Marriages were  not legally recognized  if the people 
[03:17:00]  were slaves.  Since slaves were  property, they could  not be legally  husband and wife,  my running  and child.  A lawnmower  can't marry my  rake.  So what?  Oh my god.  I'm just saying,  that's what it was  like back then.  Oh my god.  That's how it was  considered.  I'm not saying it  was right, wrong,  or indifferent.  Whatever the fuck  it was, that's what  it was back in  those days.  Holy shit.  Guys, talking in  today's mentality,  whenever you take  the fucking days  of slavery and  shit like that and  try to relate it to  today's mentality and 
[03:17:30]  intellect and how  fucking worldly we're  supposed to be, it  comes off sounding  ridiculous.  But back then, they  put them on fucking  stumps, bang the  gavel, and bid on  them.  And it wasn't  people, people  weren't going, this  is horrible, I  got 25 bucks, this  is the worst thing  I've ever done, why  am I doing this?  Uh, 20, 30 dollars.  It was acceptable, it  was what they did.  Yeah, looking back,  we understand that.  Looking back, you  see how, you know, it  was, but yeah, oh,  they didn't allow  slaves to be married,  they're buying these  people.  Of course. 
[03:18:00]  Of course they're not  going to let them get  married.  Right, that would ruin  everything.  Yes.  Holy shit, this guy is  a fucking ass.

[03:22:00]  dummy it's the feeling you get when you're fucking just with somebody you care about and you're  shoving your dick in them right in that asshole wonderful yes fabulous fucking yes just that  feeling they want to just on christmas morning be able to give a pink socks for the one they love  pink stockings by the fireplace you want to pull your penis out and have ass skin holding onto it  oh my god like you're fucking a sea urchin 
[03:22:30]  oh this guy is just so fucking full of himself wait till you hear this last 30 seconds they want  what we all want to wipe shit off our dicks with one of our his and his towels  listen for listen for it all you need to do is stand and let the tiny ember of love
