<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a condescending interview with Tom Seaver, segueing into their "F.U. Friday" segment.  Listeners vented frustrations, ranging from complaints about the NBA season and the ongoing debate about Pluto's planetary status.  A significant portion of the show focused on listener feedback regarding photos of a woman named Tara, prompting a contest where listeners could submit photos of their own "natural" bodies (no implants) for a public vote to determine who had a better physique.  A new trivia segment was introduced, awarding movie tickets for correct answers about the show.  Discussion then turned to a Chinese herbal Viagra substitute, leading to a humorous exchange with a recurring guest known for his food delivery service.  A call from Reverend Al Sharpton promoting his website (with an initially incorrect URL provided on-air) followed. More "F.U.s," further discussion of Tara's photo contest, and a recap of the previous week's "Friday Fake-O" involving a hairy listener were included. A brief discussion about a listener's wrecked car preceded a call from a woman claiming to be a friend of a staff member, leading to some crude jokes. The show concluded with a Vermont Teddy Bear Company advertisement.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of Mike Tyson's recent jail sentence and its potential impact on his boxing career. A caller engaged in a humorous debate about Mike Tyson fighting an alien. The hosts then critiqued another radio show, "The Fan," and its coverage of the NBA and Tom Seaver.  Mad Dog, a co-host, was repeatedly asked to leave.  The show featured their recurring bit "Ben the Fag," with jokes about Ben's appearance and sexuality, and discussed his social media presence.  Racially insensitive comments were made during banter about an upcoming Black Sabbath concert. Anthony recounted a confrontation with an Asian man offended by a "Yoshi" skit.  Another trivia contest for movie tickets ensued, the question being what sexually aroused Anthony in his youth (the answer, revealed by a caller, was yellow school buses).

The final segment focused on the "Friday Fake Orgasm" segment, judged by the "Peter Meter."  A call with comedian Stephen Lynch concluded the show. Lynch discussed his upcoming appearance on the show, potential inclusion in a "Hummer Club," plans for a future Opie and Anthony live broadcast, and the "Opie and Anthony Lingerie Freak Show," featuring a "hairy guy" and "Mendy Big Butt," amongst others.  Lynch's email address was provided.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey!  Good afternoon, everybody!  Black and the Mad Dog Show here on the fan.  Of course, everybody, equally awaiting the beginning of the NBA season tonight.  The next election is not a thing about us.  Is it not right, Maggie?  That's right, dog.  Everybody wondering if Patrick Ewing is going to lay back a little bit  and I'm going to try to take all the shots at that day. 
[00:00:30]  Unbelievable.  God, I love listening to that guy.  Boy, I wonder what they're talking about on the fan this afternoon.  Well, I got an interview with Tom Seaver.  We were listening to the fan on the way in.  Yes, we were.  And, my God, Tom Seaver was on.  Is this guy a little full of himself?  Just a little bit.  Well, Tom, I must say, you are a match of baseball.  Well, that's right, I am.  I'm great. 
[00:01:00]  I'm the greatest thing ever to come out of the match.  Jeez, this guy just seems pompous.  He sure does.  Yeah, that was fun.  You know, it's going to be tough to fill McCarver's shoes over there.  Well, of course it is.  You've got to give McCarver a lot of credit.  You know, he wasn't terrible.  Very good commentator.  But Tom Seaver also bringing something else to the Mets team.  A little pitch-caring coaching.  That's right.  He's going to be talking with the pitchers and the hitters  on what to look for him in pitches. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, brother.  What a mess.  What a blast.  Love it.  All right, Sophie, it's Anthony.  And, yes, it is FU Friday,  and we are ready to rock and roll once again for you guys today.  Once again, we turn the show over to the people  to voice their gripes and bitches that they've had over the week.  Anthony, can I throw out the first FU?  Ho-ho.  Actually, I'll let Morgan from Astoria throw it out.  I would like to send a big FU to the NBA  for trying to palm off this sham season on us.  I hope they all develop career-ending knee problems in the first week. 
[00:02:00]  Well, a lot of injuries in the NBA, obviously,  taking its toll on the players who weren't practicing a lot  throughout the time of the lockout.  Lock, lock, lock.  That they couldn't play.  No, the lockout.  That's what I said.  Lockout, lockout.  Could you say Friday?  Friday.  Don't make fun of my speech impediment.  What are you talking about?  I just wanted to hear Friday. 
[00:02:30]  Could you say Saturday tomorrow?  Heaven's to Murgatroyd.  Suffer and suck it has.  All right, and let's throw an FU out here from Jerry from Peekskill.  Opie and Anthony, this is good.  This is something I've been really bothered by.  I would like a big FU to all of the scientists who give a S  if Pluto should be called a planet or not.  Yeah, isn't this hysterical?  All these geeky scientists are arguing over whether Pluto is big enough  to be considered a planet.  Yes.  And Jerry writes, we have an ozone problem, world hunger, homeless people, etc. 
[00:03:00]  And these douchebags are sitting around with poles up their ass discussing what it should  be called.  Who gives an effing rat's ass?  Thanks for your time, you guys effing rules.  You know what's funny?  Do we even know there is a Pluto?  I mean, come on.  Who cares?  The thing is, is billions of miles away, right?  Like Hope says, I think there's more things to worry about here.  There you go.  All right, we're just getting started here today.  Yeah.  Send your FUs in through the fax machine is the best way today. 
[00:03:30]  212-957-WNW.  Or you can use the instant feedback.  Everyone's still commenting about Tara.  My lord, you guys.  How many emails did we read before we went on the air today?  Uh, five, well, 300 came in in the time I was sitting in the office alone.  Yeah.  And then tack that on to the 200 that we're waiting when we got here.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we've got over 500.  At least.  So, what I must say at this point in time, don't be mad if we don't write you back, because 
[00:04:00]  at this point, it's impossible.  All right?  If you could take one more.  Freak says she's cute, but not model material.  More nude biker bar type material.  Well, should we put this one to rest, do you think?  Definitely.  We have read all the feedback on Tara, and most people admit that she is a lovely lady.  She's beautiful, has an unbelievable face, probably could be a model, but she is not  playboy material. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  That's what everyone's saying.  That is the majority of what has been said the last three days.  And that's fine, and now we lay it to rest.  Well, now what I'm thinking.  Because we're also getting a lot of email from ladies who think they have a better body  than Tara.  Okay.  So, if you...  I see smoke coming out of Opie's ear.  Oh, so if you've seen Tara's picture on the NAW website by now, and you think you have  a better body, a body that is good enough for Playboy, I think you need to get a hold  of us. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, people come, girls come down here?  Well, Tara's pictures will stay up there until someone beats her.  Oh, I like this.  You know what I mean?  So now, we get another girl down here.  Yes.  Who thinks she's better than Tara.  Yes.  We take her picture.  Yes.  Put it on the web.  With Tara.  And then have everyone vote if, you know, Tara's been dethroned.  Ah.  As the hottest natural babe to be in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Yeah, only natural girls.  We're going natural.  We're not looking at implants or anything like that.  No implants for the boys. 
[00:05:30]  That's an unfair advantage.  That's right.  Oh, I like that.  So if you're a girl, you're lovely, you've got a real nice natural look, and you've maybe  had some fantasies about posing topless and want guys to look at your topless pictures.  Correct.  We'll pop you on the website.  That's right.  We'll do a little photo shoot, and then the guys can judge on who's better.  Uh-huh.  And then you'll be the king of the page.  There you go.  Queen of the page.  Queen of the page.  Until someone beats you. 
[00:06:00]  So until then, Tara's pictures will remain up.  Okay.  Could be weeks before she's dethroned.  You never know.  Guys, comb the area and find a girl you think is worthy.  It's Opie and Anthony on F.U. Friday, and Mike from Old Bridge, New Jersey writes a big  F.U. to the ticket scalpers at tonight's Savage Show.  $115 and up.  Wow.  Wow, that's it.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Metallica.  Turn the page. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  We're putting something together that is very cool that involves Metallica and you guys,  the faithful listeners of, uh, NEW.  We don't have all the details yet, but Black Earl is pumping his fist in the air.  He's excited.  Earl, are we getting close to, uh, being able to pop this on the air?  Come on.  Gotta be soon.  We're gonna fly you somewhere to see Metallica.  We can tell him that much, right, Earl?  We just did.  Okay.  Uh, it's Opie and Anthony.  It is F.U. Friday.  I think our favorite day of the week. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  We get to a vent.  Exactly.  More so than usual.  Uh, dear Opie and Anthony, a giant-sized F.U. to the jappy girl who bumped into me, uh,  this morning at Starbucks.  She dumps her coffee all over my black cashmere coat and then demands that I buy her a new  coffee because I violated her space.  Violated her space?  Scared of life.  F.U. to her.  Good show.  Shelby.  All right.  We gotta get this one out of the way.  Gary from the city.  Okay.  O&A.  I would like to send a big F.U. to the cops who put 41 rounds of bullets into an armed 
[00:07:30]  man outside his apartment.  Ouch.  You know, I hate those peddlers as much as the next guy, but 41 shots, I think that's  a little harsh, huh?  Yeah.  Well, I guess they were investigating that rapist and, um, oops, wrong guy.  Wrong guy.  Yeah.  I think the cops freaked out because they went into his apartment and they saw all those  pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio hung up in that apartment of his.  Yeah, what's that?  What's the story of that?  I don't know.  They had pictures of Leo in his house? 
[00:08:00]  I can't think of many guys that hang, uh, pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio all over their  room, but.  Well, it doesn't, uh, merit, uh, 41 bullets being shot at you.  Maybe they freaked out a little bit.  22, uh, 22 times they said he was hit, something like that, right?  That's appalling.  That's horrible.  I'm, I'm, you know, get back to the range.  41 shots and you only hit 22.  Oh, this is harsh.  It's an outrage. 
[00:08:30]  All right, let me move on here, uh, to Appenac on FU Friday.  I'd like a big FU to be sent out to my wife who won't let me join the Hummer Club.  I've been begging for two weeks now.  Her name is Missy.  We are listening to you right now.  Missy.  Come on.  Missy.  Someone named like Missy you don't expect to, uh, go on the Hummer Club.  This one is a fave of Anthony.  O&A.  F you to all you big, fat, white trash pigs that insist on wearing skin-tight stretch pants to show off your big, fat asses. 
[00:09:00]  Do you really look in the mirror and think to yourself, you look good?  Are you effing blind, you a-holes?  That's Jim from Douglas City.  What is going on?  These women, uh, uh, with the big, fat butts and the big, beefy thighs wearing those stretch pants.  Those tight stretch pants.  And then they usually wear the heavy sweater that comes down over their ass as the full get-up.  That's like their get-up.  Every day. 
[00:09:30]  But you see, like, it's like the surface of the moon on the back of their thighs.  You can see it right through that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like big.  You know, they got the stretch pants and the cellulite working.  Mm-hmm.  And then the big sweater covering it.  Thank God for the big sweater because if not, you see the, um, well, I have to say it again.  the bunt the bunt oh that's all i'll say i think everyone knows what it is all right 
[00:10:00]  well look at this i gotta move on again here  why i guess we're just talking about things i guess for this break i'm good cop and anthony's  bad cop watch how the roles change many times during the show  don't let him on to that little secret that little ruse that ploy that old gag all right man  um all right we got a four pack of tickets to uh lowest theater movie tickets oh cool and i i

[00:58:00]  sentenced him  to two years in jail  but suspended one year  he's also been fined  five thousand dollars  and will be on  two years probation  after being released  from jail  the ruling could affect  tyson's future in the ring  indiana authorities  will now have to decide  if this constitutes  a violation of his  probation on a 1991  rape conviction  of course that's a violation  yeah  assault  the sentence could also  lead to a review  of tyson's boxing license  which was recently  restored in nevada  after a year of suspension  the guy's screwed  but it's dope  hey 
[00:58:30]  good afternoon everybody  hi  back in the back dog  yeah hi  obviously  mike tyson  back in trouble again  yes he's in trouble  lots of trouble  well you gotta look  at it this way  he's a very  vulnerable personality  right  so obviously  he couldn't stay  out of trouble  for very long  well you gotta give  the judge a lot  of credit  on this one  well of course  you gotta give  the judge a lot  of credit  of course  you gotta have  a guy out there  just going crazy  assaulting people  for basic 
[00:59:00]  traffic violations  so there's a guy  he's back in jail  for another year  he's gonna jump back  out probably  good time served  and be back  in the ring again  hopefully  very soon  now mad dog  do you think  this is terrible  this is terrible  on this friday  friday  friday  friday  right  let's take some calls  all right mad dog  you're on the air  yeah this is mike  and mad dog  yes 
[00:59:30]  i love your show  long time listening  first time caller  um boy how about  this tyson thing  well you know  you guys have  a lot of personality  obviously he's  in trouble  dealing with society  so he's back in jail  all right thank you  we're gonna be  discussing the tyson thing  for 18 hours straight  so stay with us  with a friend  mike and a mad dog  they'll discuss  every single angle  they'll discuss  what would happen  if mike tyson 
[01:00:00]  were on the moon  and an alien ship  hit his ship  and he's gonna fight  with an e.t  well i think the e.t  would be able  to beat tyson  well i don't know  about that  what do you think  mikey  you think an e.t  could beat tyson  with those teeth  and be biting off ears  uh no  i don't think so dog  well i have to agree  with you there  that would be  a terrible thing  but uh i would think  tyson would beat up  the alien  thank you for the call  um what would happen  if tyson 
[01:00:30]  were to uh transport  his body  to another dimension  well that's a very  fascinating question  uh i believe  he would be in trouble  in any dimension  he was in  i think you gotta  give the caller  a lot of credit  for that uh question  well the caller  gives a lot of credit  okay  for that question  coming up  with the uh  optional dimension  question  on this friday  making a man  die show  on the fan  i love that man 
[01:01:00]  uh radio guy  that can't talk  it's hysterical  you know  they're probably relieved  that the tyson story  broke  because they were up  to hour uh  twenty of talking  about the  the nba season  starting this weekend  and what patrick ewing  is gonna be doing  on the on the car  you know what  watch him and see  yeah  that's a good way  to find out  i just hope patrick  uh decides to pass  the ball this year  don't worry about  your points patrick  what if patrick ewing  was uh  maybe a submarine  commander  how would that  play out in the nba
