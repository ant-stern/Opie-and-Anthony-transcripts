<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a chaotic, nonsensical intro song, immediately followed by Sam Roberts and Jim Florentine explaining the absence of Opie and Anthony due to their separate arrests for homosexual acts in public parks.  The hosts graphically detail Anthony's arrest, including racially charged descriptions of the encounter.  They then transition to discussing upcoming guests: David Lee Roth and Anderson Silva, sharing anecdotes about past guests like David Lee Roth, Dwight Gooden (contrasting their views on drug use), and Joan Rivers (including details of her husband's suicide). A caller phones in, engaging in sexually suggestive banter with Sam and Jim, focusing on Anthony's penis size. Jim promotes his upcoming comedy special and expresses his dislike of pets.

The conversation shifts to Jim's single life and his contrasting perspectives with his married friends, including his humorous search for a Bengal kitten and his experiences with other people's dogs.  This leads to a discussion about online anonymity, freedom of speech, and the consequences faced by public figures for controversial statements, fueled by Jim's recent online criticism. David Lee Roth briefly arrives in studio before a Dish Network commercial interrupts further discussion.

A segment follows comparing the popularity and appeal of UFC, boxing, and professional wrestling, referencing fighters like Anderson Silva and Muhammad Ali.  The discussion touches upon the business aspects and perceived decline in boxing's popularity among younger audiences. This is followed by a conversation with a guest musician who details their songwriting process using various analogies (racehorses, blacksmiths), the influence of personal experiences, producers, and the pressures of the music industry. The discussion broadens to artistic motivation, fear, revenge, competition, the impact of personal life and aging, and public perception.  The conversation touches briefly on politics, gun ownership, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, before the musician mentions their upcoming comedy special.

David Lee Roth returns for a longer conversation with Jim Florentine. Roth discusses his new comedy special, detailing his ten-month development process, including venues from small clubs to the Comedy Cellar. He describes his observational comedy style, often focusing on things going wrong, and uses a witnessed circumcision as an unexpected source of inspiration, connecting it to Paula Dean and Anthony Weiner. He contrasts his approach with sitcoms and Japanese television, shares anecdotes about his worst jobs and bosses, and discusses his views on other comedians (Louis C.K., Jim Jefferies, Amy Schumer) and podcasts (Marc Maron's).  The conversation veers into rock bands versus Broadway plays, professional wrestling, his relationship with Mick Jagger, Chris Jericho, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, and plugs for his website and podcast.  A MyPillow ad is aired.  The hosts mention their arrests and the pursuit of Mike Tyson as a guest. They conclude with reflections on creating "so bad it's good" comedy.

A heated argument erupts between Eric and Sal, escalating into a shouting match and threats of physical violence ("I'm going to suplex you"), stemming from Sal's alleged refusal to answer hotline calls, potentially from Chris Jericho. This leads to a discussion of David Lee Roth's experiences with groupies and threesomes, including humorous anecdotes. Then, Anderson Silva joins the show. He discusses his career, his loss to Chris Weidman, his upcoming rematch, training regimen, diet, fighting style, Muay Thai background, and personal life. He promotes his upcoming fight and other show segments. The show concludes with further discussion about the Sal and Eric argument, the One Direction concert causing traffic, and a review of "The World's End."

The final segment focuses on a debate about good versus bad parenting, spurred by parents and children camping for concert tickets.  Opie, Anthony, Eric, and Sal engage in an exaggerated back-and-forth about various parenting scenarios, including a child camping for One Direction tickets with their father, the movie *Jack*, and personal childhood experiences.  Listener calls are included, and there's a lengthy, humorous discussion about a departing intern referred to as "Intern Douchebag," including sexually suggestive remarks about his dating life and plans for sexual encounters in London.  Bernie calls in to discuss Sam Roberts' podcast. The segment concludes with humorous goodbyes to the intern and closing remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, I mean, this is insane.  It's so fledgling. 
[00:00:30]  Why don't we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's the sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Once simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we go.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Another four hours is long.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Check.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  With O.B. and Anthony.  Yeah.  Jimmy Tranny pornin'.  O.B. like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He workin' all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people who can say in this old.  Objectible human beings and I want you to look.  Unacceptable to my scene when I'll give it a go.  If he said Larry King, O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Go, go.  I know you're feelin' the flow.  But O.B.'s mother-huckin'.  Jimmy's tryin' to get blown.  That's right.  Things around here are changing.  Enough of this fuckin' Friday morning ritual, that song.  It's time to really celebrate.  It's time to really celebrate.  The dynamics of this show have changed forever.  This is terrible. 
[00:02:00]  Got rid of these two albatrosses.  Greg and Tony are now gone.  What a bummer of a way to start the morning.  You think so?  Somebody just woke up in a bad mood.  It's 6 o'clock in the morning.  And this is what they're hearing.  Yeah.  This is not a popular song at all, but it makes me happy.  Do you remember this, Jim?  I don't remember this one.  No.  I remember the rope for a show, but I remember the theme song.  This was the theme song.  We became obsessed with it.  And I just felt that everybody was going to enjoy that rap.  Let's just stop it and begin with this.  They were, too. 
[00:02:30]  It's like they're kind of waking up and they're used to it.  And they're like, okay.  And then it's just like, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, TGIF.  Awful.  Opie and Anthony are not here today.  Did they announce that they weren't going to be here today?  I don't think so.  I don't think they knew it.  It was really weird.  It's very rare that two guys who work on the same radio show are independently busted  for homosexual activities in parks.  Right.  But that is what happened.  Separate parks.  Separate parks.  It was really weird. 
[00:03:00]  One on Long Island.  Opie was in a remote rest area inserting his penis through a hole.  An undercover officer was on the other side.  And Anthony was doing the same thing on this side.  It's weird.  Yeah.  It's weird.  Chemistry, though, those two.  It was really odd.  Yeah.  Because Anthony, people would have been surprised to learn it was not a white one that he had  his mouth wrapped around.  He's got a lot of issues that he's been masking for a long time.  I mean, he was really nose against the wall, lips against the back of the fucking glory  hole on a black one. 
[00:03:30]  So it is myself and Sam.  And we have a good show today, I think.  I'm not just saying that.  It's because, of course, my fucking oldest comedy friend, Jim Florentine, is with us for  the entire show.  Yes, I'm psyched.  I wasn't psyched getting up at fucking 420.  It stinks, doesn't it, dude?  A guy got up at 420, you know what?  Because he...  Oh, pot.  Yeah, pot.  That's cool.  420.  You don't like that?  No.  Terrible.  Fucking stinks.  When people do 420 jokes... 
[00:04:00]  Anyone over 18 should never do a 420 joke.  Yeah, it really is awful.  Or April 20th, they're like, did they do the pot symbol to their mouth?  Yeah.  Like, I already got it.  419, they start saying, oh, 30 seconds away.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Yeah.  How great would it be if they said that, and before 420 hit, they were struck by a car.  It'd be great.  Yeah.  And David Lee Roth is coming today.  Yes.  We figured...  We didn't want it to go really particularly smoothly, so we figured David Lee Roth is  such a fucking maniac.  Right.  He'll be fun to have in for the... 
[00:04:30]  He'll be here from, I guess, seven on.  And then Anderson Silva.  And last time David Lee Roth was in here with an athlete, he really let the athlete go  ahead and have his time, so that should be good.  No, that didn't really happen.  It did now.  With Dwight Gooden, it was very funny to hear.  Him and David Lee Roth, because they had such a different take on drug use.  Right.  You weren't here when Dwight was here, were you?  No, I was here the time before, and when Dave first came in.  He came in, Doc Gooden came in, and talked about his drug use and how it was painful 
[00:05:00]  to him the night of the day, the parade.  He was fucking getting high on the projects the night before.  And he was a great guest.  He was completely open.  He was one of the best athletes I've ever had.  And David Lee Roth was here, and Dwight Gooden's like, yeah, man, that was a terrible  time.  And David Lee Roth's like, yeah, the 80s!  You know, because to him, it was just the opposite effect.  Yeah, right, yeah.  So it was so funny to hear these guys together, and I think David and Anderson will get along  for some reason, because I think Anderson will know, obviously, who he is. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Everyone knows who David Lee Roth is, and they're both martial artists, and I think he'll probably  enjoy talking.  He's researching Anderson Silva, as of last night?  Yeah, that's what he was.  I think he was emailing Roland, asking for, like, information in whatever prep material we  had and all that.  Good.  He's excited.  Did he ask for any information on me?  He figured he'd wing it with you, I think.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Well, I know I've never said anything bad about David Lee Roth.  Good.  He can research all...  Yeah.  I've been a fan since I was a little kid.  Yeah.  Watching him on talk shows, always so funny. 
[00:06:00]  I remember when Joan Rivers took over, she had that Fox show.  Yeah.  I think David Lee Roth was her first guest ever.  Was he really?  Yeah, because he used to...  Yeah.  And I remember him telling a story.  She's like, she set him up, of course.  She goes, Dave, are you a family man?  He's like, yeah, I'm a family man.  He goes, I started three or four last year, and I'll probably start three or four next  year.  And as a 14-year-old kid, I thought that was the greatest thing ever.  The greatest comedy line in history.  Yeah.  It was funny.  I mean, you hear that on TV.  You go, yeah, I start families and shit like that.  I'm like, it's fucking awesome.  That was when her husband, Edgar, it was Joan's husband. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  That was what he killed himself over, I think.  It was a Fox show.  Well, yeah.  They said that contributed to it, yeah.  He was depressed and he fucking...  After it got canceled, yeah.  He fucked her career up.  Why, was he like the producer?  Did he create the show?  Yeah, he was the producer, yeah.  Well, I think he helped her, you know, told her, look, you know, get your own show.  Because, you know, Johnny loved her.  Johnny Carson loved her.  And Johnny never talked to her after that.  Yeah.  Once she took that gig and went against him.  Because she was a guest host on Carson's show a lot. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Wasn't she the permanent guest host at one point?  Pretty much.  I think so.  Yeah.  She was.  It was, right?  Yeah.  But I think she wasn't being considered to take over.  And she heard through the grapevine that she was not going to be one of the finalists  or one of the final names.  And so she was like, I'm going to be left out in the cold.  That's what I think happened.  But at that point, Johnny wasn't ready to leave yet.  What year was that?  Mid-80s?  This was like...  Yeah, this was mid-80s.  Yeah, it was like 84, 85.  Right when Fox kind of went national.  So like 87, somewhere in there.  And she didn't call and tell him. 
[00:07:30]  I think she let him know the day before.  Like, the way she did it, I think, really bothered him.  And he was like one of those guys.  He was a loyal guy.  And he just, he felt like she betrayed him.  And he never talked to her again.  Man, he was a fucking hard guy.  Yeah.  And there was a story, too, about him, which they didn't talk about in this documentary.  When his son died, his son, I think Chris's name was, and he drove off a cliff or something  in a car accident.  Yeah.  And he was eulogizing his son on The Tonight Show.  And Fred DeCordova, who was his executive producer, I think gave him the wrap it up. 
[00:08:00]  Like, his time was going on while he was eulogizing his fucking Johnny.  And I heard that that destroyed his relationship with DeCordova.  And he never forgave him for that.  That was it.  Yeah.  And I wish that they would have touched on that because I was obsessed with that when  I heard it.  Like, why the fuck?  Like, even a young, you know, in, what, what, number 1988 or whatever that was.  I'm like, you don't fucking rush it.  Like, the guy hosting The Tonight Show when he's eulogizing his kid.  Yeah.  You idiot.  Like, for, what, commercial breaks?  How panicky are you?  It's right.  Was it live? 
[00:08:30]  The Tonight Show?  It wasn't, was it?  No.  No, but it's never been live.  I think it was live in the 60s, though.  But it was when it was in New York because it was an hour and a half long.  But that's even dumber.  Like, it's not even live.  Why would you wrap it?  It's the worst case scenario.  You cut something later.  Right.  If you have to squeeze in a commercial break somewhere.  And even if it was the advertiser, there's not one advertiser.  No.  In that situation, that wouldn't go, okay, we get it.  We've had this relationship with him for 26 years and his son, you know.  And who watching wouldn't want to see what he had to say? 
[00:09:00]  I wouldn't.  I don't go for the negativity, Iraq.  I like entertainment, and I wanted to see the fucking Bette Midler interview.  You know what?  He might have just been, he might have thought Johnny was lost and didn't know where he was  time-wise, so then he was just, like, saying, hey, I'm just letting you know that, you know,  you might be at some point, maybe, if he's just riffing.  Yeah.  But I'm sure there was a clock there that, you know, with his monologue, a seven-minute  clock that he knows he's got a hit.  Split-second decisions that that dude made that I'm sure for the rest of that guy's life,  he was like, fuck, I shouldn't have wrapped him up. 
[00:09:30]  Jim didn't talk to me for, like, two years.  Our first train we pulled, I gave him the wrapping-up sign.  Because he was going too long.  Yeah, you coming or what?  Yeah, and he couldn't come after that.  He lost his rod.  Well, you were doing that in a circle thing.  I thought you were criticizing my lack of an erection.  I thought you were mocking me in a lasso fashion.  You and the girl were laughing.  By the way, Joan Rivers was 1986.  Yeah.  Oh, how long did that last?  It doesn't say here.  Let me see.  And I don't want to upset or alarm anybody, and I don't want people at home to get upset, 
[00:10:00]  but can I ask somebody for a napkin?  There's a drop of coffee here.  I'm wearing a white shirt.  I don't want to transfer the coffee onto my shirt.  That's going to upset people.  I just didn't want anybody to think that it was, you know, I was, I'm okay.  Make sure when the napkin comes in, you give an update.  Yeah, please.  And it's our intern's last day.  Fucking, um.  Intern douchebag.  Yeah.  Oh, the poor boy.  I feel bad for him.  Do you?  Now you do?  I've always felt bad for him.  Not, not because we, he was overshadowed by two hot girls that we all sleep, sleep  with the ones that have sex with, but because he didn't get invited to Anthony's. 
[00:10:30]  Ever.  Oh, I know.  Never came through.  I know.  It wasn't like, oh yeah, this first one, it'll just be the girls, but then the next  one, Anthony will invite me.  And it was just like, yep, leaving for a vacation, buddy.  Hey, see you later.  And that's it.  There never was another.  There's no send off.  No.  Her show was done in 87.  Fox tried to fire her husband, a big legal battle.  And then three months after that, he killed himself, which Joan believes was because of  the humiliation from Fox.  That's so, it's so, uh, and I think she said as a comedian, I always remember hearing that 
[00:11:00]  that all she wanted to do was go on stage, but she couldn't.  She couldn't, you know, because everybody knew that her husband just killed, so there was  nothing to talk about.  She, you know, it was too awkward, but she said that's all she wanted to do is just get  up and fucking perform and, you know, kind of, I guess, forget everything for a little  while.  All right.  That's a nice way to start the show.  Last show before vacation.  Remember when Joan Rivers' husband killed himself?  Yeah.  Just in case you'd forgotten. 
[00:11:30]  And Arsenio's coming back now.  He's in September.  I think he'll do well.  I don't think he'll do what he did back then because he won't, he's not catching anybody  off.  These fucking Starbucks lids, I literally, they make me nuts.  Why?  Why?  I hate them more than, I literally hate them as much as I hate Al Qaeda.  They fucking drip from the lid, like when you put them down.  Look at, look at that drip right there.  It's one drop.  Yeah, I never, I never.  It's passive aggressive.  Yeah, I don't remember them dripping.  They've been doing that for a year.  In my second book, I bashed Starbucks.  Thank you, young girl.  For the, Al Qaeda took down the trade centers. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, and they've killed a lot of innocent people.  That's one drop of coffee on a piece of paper.  How many accidents have fucking happened because somebody has dripped a drop of this coffee  on the fucking back of their knuckle?  It's enraging.  I'd rather drip all over me than drink that fucking shit Dunkin' Donuts crap.  You don't like Dunkin' Donuts?  America runs on Dunkin'.  No, it doesn't.  You don't like that?  No, their coffee's horrendous.  It's fucking burnt.  Tastes like shit.  I don't mind it, but I haven't had it in a long time.  It's awful.  Why are you waving at E-Raw? 
[00:12:30]  Because he's not looking.  Somebody's on the hotline and nobody's looking at the phones.  I just walked back in.  Let's see who's on the hotline.  Let me guess.  It's nice to see Norton struggling.  Hello?  Who's this?  Oh, there it is.  You're on the air.  Hey.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, fuck, shit, fuck.  Hi.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi.  We miss you.  Well, I was listening to the program.  Oh.  And I decided to call in. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, this is so nice.  I could do the show while laying in bed touching my genitals.  I like that.  I would like to be there with you, actually.  Not for the genital reason.  Not in that reason, but just to kind of be in your house broadcasting.  I think it would be a lot of fun.  Oh, I thought not to be broadcasting, to be touching my genitals.  No, I always picture your genitals as big and heavy.  I've actually never seen Ant's cock.  Yeah.  But I...  I try to hide it like the Loch Ness Monster.  Why do you think it's big and heavy?  There's just...  His bulge is big, and there's also stories... 
[00:13:30]  I hope he told a story about Anthony exposing himself to girls  who has to see it.  And they're like, oh, my God.  Anthony's just...  He's just so Italian that it's just got to be a big thing.  You think so, yeah.  They were drunk, though, those girls.  It was like a bachelorette party.  We were at a bar, and we went outside, and the girls were like,  oh, show it.  They were all drunk Boston chicks.  They were like, show us your fucking cock.  I was like, yeah, all right.  You know, I felt a little pumped up.  So I showed, and the girl was like, oh, wow. 
[00:14:00]  But it was nothing special.  I think it was like an illusion.  You know, like, you know, oh, look, the wavy line.  He's being modest.  He's being modest about it.  The angles are the same.  And, yeah, she kind of dug it and stuff.  And then she touched it, which was really cool.  That was so filthy.  But it was really nice.  Did I touch it?  I'm like, well, let me think this over.  Yes!  Do you think that Ope heard that reaction  and just kind of misinterpreted what that reaction was? 
[00:14:30]  I think so.  He thought, like, this big fucking anaconda came out.  And, you know, it's a regular dick.  But they seemed to enjoy it.  But he heard it and was like, oh.  And I think he had some shrinkage going on.  So he kind of felt a little, yeah.  Well, those Boston chicks are used to the white Irish guys up there.  So your Italian mule up there.  Yeah, it was probably anything was bigger than that.  What they're used to seeing.  You know, those drunk Irish guys that can't get it up  because they've been drinking all night. 
[00:15:00]  So that's what they're used to seeing.  So anything that's, you know, halfway sober and thick.  It's probably thick.  Yeah, yeah, it helps.  A bunch of slobs with freckled balls.  I know.  Fucking matted red hair on top of their freckled balls.  Exactly.  So you guys were, I knew you guys had probably potted up.  I did a radio tour yesterday, which was actually good for a terrestrial radio tour.  Yes.  But I knew you guys were listening. 
[00:15:30]  And I was slightly panicky the whole time.  No, that was very good.  And we went through, I guess, three shows that you were on.  And, yeah, we potted it up.  And they were actually really good.  And you were fucking amazing.  Oh, thanks, man.  You were funny as fuck, man.  But you know what?  We weren't cringing or freaking out or yelling at the other radio guys that were interviewing you.  They did a good job.  Yeah, and they're all guys.  I think at that hour, I forget who it was.  Like, you know, Free Beer and Hot Wings are actually a good show.  And they're guys that have been fans of this show. 
[00:16:00]  And they've been good to me.  And then Lewis and Floor Wax.  You know, some of these weird name shows are actually really good dudes.  And good shows.  They're out of Denver.  And I forget who else I did at that hour.  Yeah, you turn on.  And you're expecting, like, to cringe.  You're like, let's wait for it.  Let's wait for it.  And then it's just a decent, good interview.  Yeah, yeah, you couldn't make something of it.  You're these dicks.  They're so good.  And I was like, no, they're actually really good.  And, you know, Jimmy's fucking killing.  It was great, man. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, you talking about your special at all?  Not yet.  We have not mentioned it.  Why?  Because it's airing this evening.  Thank you, Anthony.  I really am.  Yes, it airs tonight.  And driving in, Kenny and I saw a Jim Norton Epix little thing on the back of the phone booths or whatever they have, which is really cool.  They have these automatic billboards now.  And we stopped at the light, and I saw my thing.  So Epix has been really, really good about it.  What time is it on?  10 o'clock on Epix or epixhd.com. 
[00:17:00]  Every billboard in Los Angeles was either you or Louis C.K.  Well, Louis has, I was out there last week, and Louis, FX has for Louis, every, literally from the airport to the hotel.  I guess because Louis is coming back shortly, or they're just kind of getting everybody into that mindset.  And they're good fucking billboards because they have, like, legitimate quotes.  Yeah.  Like, this is the best show on TV, Rolling Stone.  I don't have those quotes.  Jim's funny.  And then I'll quote, like, you know, Jim Florentine. 
[00:17:30]  Sam Roberts.  Like, I don't have, you know what I mean?  Jim's a what lover from Anthony Comia.  I don't have those.  But, yeah, they were.  There were a bunch of Epix billboards for you, though.  They did.  I think they felt bad because this week was, it's a really weird week for us because everyone's off.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, even, and by the way, thanks, Ed.  Opie and Anthony split their vacation mostly to help me out so I could be live for my special.  And I knew these guys were taking off. 
[00:18:00]  And they said, look, man, if you want us to come in for the show, we will come in.  Like, so I know you guys were both willing to do that.  Yeah, no, you know, we wanted to split the vacation up anyway.  We took off last week and then we're taking off this week.  But, you know, we did up until Thursday and then Opie, like two days ago, I think it was, Opie's like, hey, man.  Because he's got that beach house out there and he's been paying, you know, he pays a lot of fucking money for it.  It's great.  He lives in the city, so the thought of getting out into a real house by a beach and stuff is like fucking heaven for him and his kids and his wife. 
[00:18:30]  So he's like, dude, I'd really like to take Friday off.  But, you know, if it's just me and shit, not you.  And before he even got you out, I'm like, yes, yes, I'm taking off, fuck it.  But like I said, though, just laying in bed like this, doing the show, if I could do this every day, oh, I'd never be late.  You know, it's really hard to do on the phone.  Like, there's something about it. 
[00:19:00]  The thing yesterday that was comfortable, like you're on the phone right now, which is hard.  Yesterday they had me on, like, with just an earpiece in my ear, just kind of sitting in a chair in a room.  And it was a little easier than being on the telephone.  Being on the phone, there's a really weird delay of pressure.  And you sound like you're on an ISDN.  You don't sound like you're on a phone, do I?  Yeah, you know, I'm using what they call, in the old days, they called this, I think, a landline.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to use my regular, my little cell phone, but I got one of those. 
[00:19:30]  The Apple Corporation is so great.  You get the chargers, and within two months, they don't work anymore.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, they're bent up.  I have to, like, twist it around and lay it down and not touch it, and it'll charge.  But now that thing is completely dead.  I think I got about 45% battery power, and I was like, you know, let me just use this phone.  You know what, dude?  You got to get the new cord.  It wraps up in a circle, dude.  I'm sure Bob Kelly has an answer for that. 
[00:20:00]  Of course he does.  If we ask Bob.  It's built into the stroller, dude.  Yeah, he's got, Bob's got his son now, and it's, have you seen his kid?  No, I haven't seen his kid yet.  He's fucking adorable.  Adorable.  Bob's little, Bob's baby is, and Bob wanted a baby.  He wanted to have a kid, and him and Don have a really cute kid.  But it's funny here, and we're talking about the technology with the baby now, like the  baby monitor, and the, you know, he's just as obsessive with the stroller, and exactly 
[00:20:30]  it, it's the same Bob, but just now in father mode.  In daddy mode, yeah.  Is he, I'm not like, is he a good dad?  I'm sure he's not like fucking beating the kid on the edge of the sink or anything like  that, but is he like a good, like, like loving kind of daddy?  Is he doting?  Yeah.  The kid's actually already correcting Bob's grammar, which is nice.  But yeah, he is, he doesn't mind changing the shitty diapers or feeding him.  Like, he kind of, he likes, but they, they would try, him and his wife wanted a baby. 
[00:21:00]  Like, for a while, he's like, he was so psyched when his wife got pregnant, like, so, you know.  Jim, I love when you talk about the fact that all your friends, for the most part and stuff,  are either married or have kids and stuff, and I'm like pretty much the last bastion of  your friends that don't have kids and are still living this fucking childlike existence.  And, uh, it's so weird because, because, and I've said it before, when, when these guys 
[00:21:30]  have kids, they completely jump in with the shitty diapers and fucking look how adorable  they are.  And, oh, dude, this kid, and I can't even conceive what that's like.  Yeah.  You know what?  Anthony, I was like that too.  I was like, I've never changed a diaper.  Not doing it.  Once you have them, it's like, so what?  It's your kid's shit.  It's not that big of a deal.  You got baby wipes, fucking two wipes.  It's done.  And it's not, yeah, I, I believe me.  I was a hundred percent against it before too.  Oh my God.  Kids are fucking annoying. 
[00:22:00]  They just want attention.  They're like fat chicks.  They're just, you know, everywhere you go, they're a problem and they're just crying and  you can't have, and you know, some of the time, but you know, I'd say about 20% of the  time it's like that, but the other 80%, it's, it's, it's, it's cool.  I, I, I've heard that from everyone that's had a kid.  I'm just now committing to getting a cat.  But I'm like, I'm thinking like, yeah, I could do a cat because like, eh, you could  leave them for two weeks while I'm in Vegas.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:22:30]  You put enough fucking cat shit powder in the corner and, and some food and it's great.  And people like, dude, fuck the cat.  You got to get a dog.  And all I'm thinking is like, you might as well have a kid.  Right.  You got to fucking walk it like twice a day.  At least you can't leave it alone.  It freaks out.  It's like, and, and I, like, I can't even commit to a dog.  Nevermind a kid.  But a kitten is a much easier animal.  I mean, you had them when I was growing up and you go away and you really can leave it.  So there's a certain, you don't have to panic that the thing's going to fucking die. 
[00:23:00]  That's what it is.  I just, I, I, I would like another living being around the house.  I'm at the point where I can actually consider having a living thing in my house aside from  me and, uh, but, but I don't want it to totally take over my life.  I want to be able to go, Oh, Atlantis, Bahamas.  Right.  Um, I'm, I'm, I'm out of here.  Are you going to Atlantis or are you just saying that?  You know what?  I just said it and I might do it.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I know.  I got to get home.  I got a dog at home.  He's, he's by himself.  So, you know, I'm already saying, all right, I'm leaving him for seven and a half hours.  I left enough food out and I'm like, I got to fucking rush home right after the show.  If you knew, by the way, cause I know Jim for 20 years or more than that, since 1990.  If you know the, hearing him say this, it's literally like sitting next to Al Sharpton and  him going, I only like white pussy.  It's just what I enjoy.  Like the, but I know Jim is so, he's, he's telling the truth.  So there's gotta be something to it because first of all, you would never pet people's 
[00:24:00]  dogs.  I wouldn't even look at him.  Bob Levy had a dog and I wouldn't even look at the dog.  He's like, at least look.  I'm like, no, I'm not even looking.  Let's just go.  I don't want to be around this thing.  And he would be like, did you, did you like my dog?  I didn't notice him.  Do you?  I didn't.  I refuse to look at him.  You don't know what color.  Nope.  I never even looked at him.  I could care less.  It means nothing to me.  There was that story, a famous story about this road rage thing in California.  This is probably 10 years ago where this good, this lady had a little dog on her lap and 
[00:24:30]  they got in an argument on a freeway and the guy took the dog and threw it in the traffic.  And I, at that time, I thought that was the fucking funniest story I've ever heard.  I would talk about it on stage and it got the worst groans ever.  And I didn't care.  I just bring it up every night.  And now I think it's horrific.  I'm like, holy shit.  That's fucking got to be brutal.  To grab someone's little dog.  Yeah.  And throw it right in the traffic.  But you still kind of think it's so funny.  It is such a dick move.  You have to applaud it.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:25:00]  So have you had any luck finding it or no?  What's that?  Have you had any luck at all finding it?  What you want, the Bengal cat you want is beautiful.  I want a little Bengal kitten.  They look like little leopards.  And I'm looking, but I don't know any of this shit.  And people are like, you've got to get a good cattery.  A good cattery to look at.  I don't even know what a cattery is.  It sounds like a Dr. Seuss thing.  Yeah, no, a cattery, it's like one of the things on your eyes. 
[00:25:30]  Fucking all run, Lord.  Fuck yeah.  Foul ball.  You know, because you've got cataracts.  So I don't know where you'd go to a cattery.  I don't know where that is.  I don't know either.  People are giving me suggestions.  But I think like, all right, I'm in New York.  If I've got to look out on Long Island or Jersey or something like that,  even Connecticut, it's fine.  But then people are like, you've got to look at this cattery in Iowa.  Like, what are they fucking going to ship it to me or something?  And then I can't look at it beforehand or something. 
[00:26:00]  I want somewhere local where I can look at a cute little kitten,  give him a little shuka shuka under the chin,  see if he looks at me and gives a little, and then take him home.  I don't need a big, what the Italians call a big budel.  You don't want the airlines involved.  Because they might ship you a fucking cat that's not the one you look at the picture of.  What are you going to do, send it back in a box?  Well, you know about that bait and switch thing, don't you, Jim?  I sure do.  All of a sudden you're expecting a female cat,  and a fucking male cat shows up, and you're like, 
[00:26:30]  well, I guess what am I going to do?  I paid already.  I don't want to be rude and embarrassed,  so I might as well fuck its mouth.  I might as well play litter box anyway.  Yeah, dude, you and Colin are the last hole.  Colin Quinn, but Colin at least leads an adult life.  Colin leads a man's lifestyle as far as a gentleman.  Like, you know, he does what he does.  He's a lonely idiot, but he at least, you know.  But you have a dinosaur, and you fucking play army with guns.  Like, you're my last hole, dude. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I really am.  And you know what?  It is strange, because there are times where I do look at, you know,  you do take stock of yourself every so often as a pseudo-adult,  and think, wow, what am I doing?  But the truth of the matter is, like,  I can't really see the downside to it, what I'm doing.  I know it's not really the gist of what adults are supposed to be doing,  the way I lead my life. 
[00:27:30]  But I don't know.  I kind of find this fun.  There are times, though, where, you know, I'm sitting alone,  maybe even a couple of hours ago.  It was still dark outside.  I'm just watching some bad television,  tweeting my angry racism on Twitter.  And I'm thinking, like, what am I doing?  What the hell am I doing with my life?  And then the sun comes up, and Jimmy Norton's on the radio.  I call up, and this is great.  Who cares?  It does be, like, once in a while I get that, too,  where you're like, fuck, man, it would be nice, 
[00:28:00]  because I'd miss certain things about having a girlfriend  and certain friendship aspects of things.  But then, like, when you're in a relationship,  there are how many nights do you look and go,  oh, what the fuck am I doing?  Yes.  I would rather have the occasional I'm lonely,  and I've been watching too much porn,  to the, oh, I hope she dies before she gets home.  I hope something happens.  I've had company over the house,  and after a few minutes, you're thinking, like,  oh, my God, I wish I was just alone 
[00:28:30]  so I could watch this mafia documentary.  Right.  Without this idiot yapping.  Yeah.  And, yeah.  But then, when you're alone, you're thinking, like,  maybe I should be doing something else with my life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you, man, I remember one time,  like, on my rock bottom was,  I remember I had some chick over in my apartment.  I had a place on the beach.  I'm like, I want, I always tell my therapist,  I go, I just want to live on the beach by myself.  He goes, you're going to be lonely.  You're not going to like it.  I go, no, I can't wait. 
[00:29:00]  He goes, you watch.  And the Dufresne wanted to live on the beach.  I get a place on the beach, right?  I finally got to Jersey Shore, right up,  the beach is right there,  and the first night I'm in my place,  I got a Tuesday in June.  I'm sitting there.  It's like 8 o'clock at night.  I'm like, this sucks.  So I'm like, what am I going to do?  I call my nephew, who's 21,  that lives down the road.  He's like, you want to play beer pong with my friends?  I'm like, all right, this is over, this lifestyle.  That's sad, right?  And then the next night,  some chick came over that I met,  and she's like, let me crack your knuckles. 
[00:29:30]  And I'm like, what?  She's like, come on, it's fun.  I'm like, no, it's not.  And I fucking threw her out.  I'm like, all right, I'm done.  That's a great thing  if you have two fingers in her ass  and she says that.  So yeah, we're watching TV.  She's like, come on,  let me crack your knuckles.  I'm like, what am I, fucking six?  I wish.  You're like, I know exactly what that feeling's like.  I remember years ago,  this is fucking like a million years ago.  I was in my early 20s,  and I went to a high school party.  I had to be 22 or 23, 
[00:30:00]  and I went to a high school party,  and I was looking around like,  oh man, this is over.  I shouldn't even be here.  I feel fucking way out of place and shit.  And then, like, a couple of months ago,  I went to a prom.  And I was thinking like,  wow, I should have fit right in,  you know, all those years ago.  But, you know,  if you felt like a creep back then,  there's nothing wrong with feeling like a creep now. 
[00:30:30]  Do you know how great that is, though,  that that's your crate?  You have a crate,  but you've been married, though, dude.  You fucking went down the road.  You did it for a long time.  And you were in it with Melinda,  I mean, for years.  Yeah.  And you weren't cheating on it.  Like, I literally,  every time I saw Anthony,  he was with his girl.  And every time I saw her,  he was with him.  And you were with, like,  I think, what,  two women over a 16 or 17 year period.  So, you fucking put your time in,  and now you're just doing  what you should be doing  with that fucking giant dick,  big house, fucking pool,  a dinosaur and a bunch of guns, 
[00:31:00]  and just hatred from way back when,  just running around,  fucking spewing it  like an angry cock with Twitter.  Exactly.  I want to come by,  by the way,  I haven't been to your house  much at all this summer,  and I kind of miss going over  and hanging out.  Well, let me tell you something.  This week is chock full of hijinks  and shenanigans.  Is it?  Well, Anthony,  I'll bring my kid and my dog.  You know what?  That isn't even off base,  because my brother's coming 
[00:31:30]  with his kid,  my sister.  Like, you know,  there are some parties  I'll have this week  where it's family stuff with kids,  and then it culminates  in this horrific,  Caligula-like Labor Day weekend.  And by that,  you mean you want a table  and somebody with a big ring  and a bucket of lard?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Caligula.  Yeah, the Labor Day weekend  is going to be like  a Friday, Saturday, Sunday  complete stretch of party. 
[00:32:00]  But this week, you know,  anybody that wants to stop by,  not, you know,  people listening on the show,  they could pretty much  go fuck themselves.  Yeah, that's right.  People I know.  You, Florenti, anybody.  You know, come by.  Hang out.  I may come by tonight or tomorrow.  I leave Sunday for L.A.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Tonight's fine.  I got a couple of people  coming over tonight.  Absolutely.  They may all come after.  I think I'm doing a set  or something and, you know,  I'm not going to sit  and watch my own special.  It's just too creepy.  I'm responsible, irresponsible guy. 
[00:32:30]  And I realized that tonight  because I, it was about,  I guess when it was about 3.30,  maybe 4 in the morning,  I decided, you know what?  I really do want to kind of  take a dip in the pool,  but I didn't want to be the guy  that was found floating in the pool.  Right.  Dead the next morning.  So I stayed in the shallow end.  But I went in the pool,  which is bad enough.  Why?  Well, I was kind of drinking.  Oh, okay.  You were from, yeah, yeah.  Kind of drinking a little. 
[00:33:00]  Okay.  But not enough to where I couldn't realize,  like, eh,  maybe I should stay out of the deep end.  I'll lend you my son's floaties.  I should.  Oh, imagine being found dead with floaties.  I know.  Imagine,  imagine me as your co-worker  having to explain that to people.  Oh!  Can you imagine?  I'm embarrassed.  And dealing with the haters.  Good for him!  And I got to write back,  he was a good guy!  Oh, they would be.  They'd come up with things to say. 
[00:33:30]  Oh!  You didn't know him!  I really hope I...  All your tweets would be in the,  you know,  in the paper.  Look at his last eight tweets.  Yeah.  A quote, unquote,  race tweet jock dies.  Shocking racist tweeter guy dead drowned.  You know,  people we talk about,  they don't even,  most of my,  I got yelled at yesterday  because I was tweeting about this whole,  this whole,  this racial shit.  It's not even the crimes that bother me  as much as the way it's reported.  I don't...  Yes! 
[00:34:00]  I'm not...  That's why I don't understand.  You,  you've gotten shit for it,  but you're not even talking about  the crime itself for the most part.  You're talking about the way  it's being reported  or the lack thereof.  Yeah.  And that's all it is.  It's very frustrating.  But on Twitter,  it's so hard sometimes,  the 140 characters,  to say what you want,  which is kind of what makes it great.  Yeah.  But it's also hard  to kind of get your point across.  Like,  you get into these back and forth  on Twitter.  Oh my God.  And I've done that,  but I can't do it anymore.  Like,  once in a while,  I'll go,  I just find that blocking people  is easier  because it's too frustrating  to get wrapped up 
[00:34:30]  trying to re-quote them  and to get my...  It's just fucking...  My head hurts trying to do that.  It's so much energy  and I wind up  just being fucking angry  and, you know,  getting sick over it.  I found an easier way to do it  if you retweet the person  and then you capture  a little bit of the essence  of what they're saying.  And as long as you put a dot,  dot, dot,  where you cut them off,  it lets the people know  there was a little more,  but you know what?  What I have to say  is a lot more...  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Yeah.  Give them just a little... 
[00:35:00]  What's that called?  The dot, dot, dot ellipsis?  Yes.  I call it a dot, dot, dot, Jimmy.  So do I.  It just sounds a little bit easier.  You know what Don Jameson does?  Someone will tweet him and go,  Dude, you fucking suck.  You're the worst host  on that metal show.  Fucking die already.  So he'll quote tweet and go,  Dude, you're the best host  on that metal show.  You're my biggest fan.  So he retweets that.  He changes it,  and then he blocks the guy  right after he posts it.  So the guy can't even come back.  Isn't that fucking beautiful?  That's great.  Nothing annoys people more  than when you change their tweet. 
[00:35:30]  You change...  Yeah.  You retweet them,  change it to a positive tweet,  and then you just block them.  You block them.  Oh, does that annoy them?  Do you know,  on Red Eye last night,  we talked about one of the stories...  I saw you on Red Eye.  Thank you.  I got you a very nice text this morning.  Thank you.  And one of the things we talked about  is the Huffington Post  is now going to block anonymous posters.  Yes.  Because they thought the trolling  got too aggressive and shitty, 
[00:36:00]  and so now no more anonymous posts.  And I love it.  I love it.  I've been railing against the anonymity  on the internet for a long time  because I just hate people.  Me and you have gone back and forth  on this one.  This is something we really...  Right.  ...don't really agree on  because I think  if you can't post anonymously,  you're cutting back  on a lot of people's opinions  because we've been put in this position  where your livelihood,  your family,  your job,  everything,  your reputation  is put in jeopardy  if you post under your own name 
[00:36:30]  and speak your piece  in this day and age.  And it has nothing to do  with somebody not being courageous  or not wanting to speak their piece  with their name on it.  I would love to plenty of times  say a lot more than I do  and put my name on it.  But the fact of the matter is  with this PC shit we're dealing with,  it's taken,  it's taken out of context,  it's twisted around,  and you get fucked.  Yeah, and again,  I kind of said last night  that I know I'm in a job 
[00:37:00]  where I have more leeway too.  I do understand that.  And there are certain times  where let's just say  you're a cop or a fireman  and you don't feel good  about black people  or Jews or gays  or whatever the group is.  Like let's say you're a cop  or you're a fireman  and you're a civil servant  and you're against gay marriage.  Right.  And you want to say,  look, I think this is against...  I guess there's the point  that you make.  It's right.  It's hard for you  even in a nice way.  Like even if you're not being...  Even just criticizing individuals,  it doesn't even have to be groups.  Right. 
[00:37:30]  You know,  there are a lot of companies  that don't want you  because they feel like  you're a representative  of that company.  So if you start saying  this movie sucked,  well, you know,  we're associated with blah, blah, blah.  And that, yeah,  and that's the point  where I have...  I kind of look and go,  all right, that's a good point.  And it's like when I think of  anonymity on the internet,  I'm not thinking of people  posting legitimate,  real opinions  and trying to have a dialogue  but fighting against  the politically correct shitty...  You know the trolls  that we're talking about.  We're talking about trolls.  Guys that aren't doing that  but guys that want to just walk up 
[00:38:00]  and go like,  I fucking hate kikes  but won't say that  because they're afraid.  Like they're the same ones  that would say it to one guy  but they wouldn't say it  in a room full of Jews.  And there's something about that  that annoys me.  Like they want people to hear it  but they don't want to  fucking say it out loud.  That just kind of sickens me.  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that part of it  but you can't then weed them out  and not also weed out the people  that just really want to  voice their opinions  honestly and openly 
[00:38:30]  but not get the...  And not the consequences  that come with  the freedom of speech  because I understand that.  Everything comes with consequence  and if you want to  spout off about something  there's going to be consequence  especially if it's controversial.  But there's this  this pall that's hanging over  freedom of speech these days  and it's the...  the concept that you can lose  everything  based on the fact  that you said something  against blacks 
[00:39:00]  or gays  or something  and that anonymity  lets you speak your piece  but not risk  your entire livelihood.  Yeah, you mean  unfair consequences  like...  And you're right  that's a hard thing  for me to argue  because you're right  like there are times  where you'll say something  that's legitimately  just an opinion  like when Perez Hilton  asked the Miss America  contestant  about her feelings  on gay marriage  I didn't agree with her  I thought she was wrong  but she expressed a view  when asked  or Helen Thomas  at the White House 
[00:39:30]  I didn't necessarily  agree with her  she expressed  a legitimate opinion  when asked  and people are penalized  for that  so yeah I guess  that's the part  where the anonymity  is something  that you might need  you said it before  which is  you've said it before  if you're asked  and you give  your honest answer  how the hell  could you then  be penalized  by that  it amazes me  the people that  asked you  are like  oh my god  that's horrendous  you asked  here's my answer 
[00:40:00]  but I think  if we were a country  that stood up  like as individuals  you know how  we just sit there  and watch Paula Deen  get crucified  or watched  if we were a country  of people  that believe  so strongly  in freedom  of unpopular  of speech  that's unpopular  and fought  every time  it was threatened  that shit  wouldn't happen  like if we truly  as individuals  believe that  and like when  a company  fired a guy  because he expressed  an opinion  like literally  if everyone  came out of the woodwork 
[00:40:30]  and defended  that Miss America  even gay people  for her shitty opinion  then people  wouldn't need anonymity  but we kind of  don't do that  we kind of  allow people  to get in trouble  it's unfortunate  you're right  well look  I mean looking  the Alec Baldwin tweets  you know  the homophobe tweets  he put out there  nobody said a word  about it  no one in Hollywood  came out and said  how could he say that  you know  you better take  his commercials away  two days later  he's doing the  fucking Capital One  commercials  right  no one cared  yeah no one  Mel Gibson did that  Mel Gibson in a rage  just screaming at his 
[00:41:00]  girlfriend  you know  in an argument  you're going to say  awful things  and you know  the guy's done one movie  in the last eight years  yeah  yeah it's true  I mean it really is  they're very selective  in who they penalize  and all that stuff  and people are more  eager to be outraged  than they are  to defend somebody  yeah  people are happier  being angry at somebody  than they are  you know  people love to be outraged  this day and age  they love a good outrage  they love getting  somebody in trouble  too  they love seeing  somebody get in trouble  that's not them 
[00:41:30]  I got them in trouble  apologize too  yeah  oh I'm sorry  that I said  yes you are  yeah  and then we want to  see you fired anyway  right yeah  because once they get  their apology  they're not like  okay it's all good  they're like  well and he should  lose his job too  and there was  there was a weird thing  like recently on ESPN  there was a black anchor  who called another  black anchor  this is off the air  yeah it was Hugh Douglas  Hugh Douglas  called this guy  a house nigger  and he like called him  an Uncle Tom  and he was drunk  apparently or allegedly drunk 
[00:42:00]  and he was angry  and it was in front of people  and that was  but that was a black guy  saying it to another black guy  another black guy  yeah  and of course the media  reported it  they didn't go  nearly as far with it  but ESPN  I knew was going to fire him  because I know  they're in a position  where they have to fire him  for that  and they did  and a part of me  was glad like good  because it's even for  and then a part of me  was like no  I don't want to see him  fired for that  and so  I'd rather see him  not fired  and other people  not fired  I agree  than see  oh because the white guy 
[00:42:30]  said something  that was controversial  and he got fired  well now you gotta  fire this guy  I'd rather see no one  fired for what they say  like I'm disgusted  with the way  people are being fired  and chastised  and forced to apologize  and being held hostage  by interest groups  based on just what they say  it's amazing  how bad it's gotten  and he didn't even say it  on the air  this is at like some convention  or something like that  where they were just hanging out  I could see if it was on ESPN  because they do a show together  they do some kind of 
[00:43:00]  TV show together  the guys  but  you knew he was done  yeah  he went to the  anyway on the air  and they didn't have him on  is David out here or no?  I think he's coming up  oh he's walking up  the hallway  yeah  do you wanna  yeah David Lee Roth  we gotta take a break  because our food is here  and we gotta take our first break  alright kid  and if you wanna call back  of course  you're Anthony of the Opie  and Anthony show  you're welcome to do  whatever it is you like  my friend  you guys have fun  alright buddy  yeah I'll be listening  of course  until I  what they call  I guess pass out 
[00:43:30]  alright  give me a call later  or a text Jimmy  and yeah  pop by later  we'll fucking hang out  yeah yeah  I wanna see you tonight man  cool man  have fun guys  thanks Anthony  see you soon  so we have David Lee Roth  coming in  in about  I guess five minutes  after this break's over  and of course  Florentine's here  and then Anderson Silva  comes in a little later  that's the main reason  I wanted to come in today  was to talk to Anderson Silva  what about your special  that's tonight at 10 o'clock  I do wanna promote that  honestly  but I would've literally  just fucking recorded a promo  it's about 
[00:44:00]  I wanna talk to Anderson Silva  so we'll be back  in soon time  good  you know you probably heard  all about the whole  home DVR  from a dish called  the hopper  if you have it  you're living under a rock  as we talk about it  every day  three times a day  one of the most amazing  features is auto hop  which gives you the power  to skip all the commercials 
[00:44:30]  for most major networks  and prime time shows  all you have to do  isn't this a commercial  it is a commercial  and the Buddhist monk  said  David Lee Roth here  ladies and gentlemen  good to see you  do not skip over this  and the Buddhist monk  said to me  moderation in all things  and I said  that would include moderation  would it not  yes  that's an excellent point  well if this gets rid  of all commercials  this is a self  continue  I'm fascinated  you got my attention  alright yes  this gets rid of  I should say 
[00:45:00]  most commercials  this one for some reason  it will not skip through  that's a great point though  I'm sure they hadn't  thought of that  when they wrote this either  but this will change  by the next time we read it  it gives you the power  to skip most commercials  this is not a commercial  actually  this is more of just  a fun riff I'm doing  all you have to do  is enable it once  the first time  you play back a show  then put down the remote  and let the hopper  skip all the commercials  when you try to fast forward  through commercials  with a normal DVR  it never really works  with the hopper from Dish  you can finally watch  your favorite shows  totally interrupted 
[00:45:30]  all the way through  from beginning to end  completely commercial free  if you love watching  primetime network shows  but hate sitting through  the shitty commercials  the auto hop feature  is perfect for you  and you can get it  with the hopper from Dish  and only  with the hopper from Dish  watch more TV  watch fewer commercials  all with the hopper from Dish  call 800  watch TV  to get Dish Network today  plan starts at just  $29.99  everyone can afford that  $29.99 a month  that's 1-800-WATCH-TV 
[00:46:00]  call today  it's a great product  what if I only want to  watch just the commercials  and skip all the  television content  I come from the part  of the country  out in Newcastle, Indiana  where it's not unusual  to see the moms  go to Kentucky Fried  pull all the fry  off the chicken  feed it to the kids  and throw the meat away  so what if I want to  throw away the actual  content of the show  Jim and just keep  the commercials  because sometimes  they're actually better  than the show itself  well you're asking me  and I would take that  question and I would put  to the Dish Network  what are you guys  going to do about that 
[00:46:30]  because I have no idea  can you reverse it  you know is it like  a Will Smith robot movie  where you know  I bet you could  it won't cancel itself  but it'll cancel  all the other  it can't self-destruct  like the Terminator  you know how  Schwarzenegger  couldn't lower himself  into the vat  to kill himself  at the end of Terminator 2  that's probably the way  this is  it will cancel all commercials  but it cannot block itself  from being played  okay first I want to just  weigh in philosophical  and say that  a lot of the times  the best artwork  of all is during 
[00:47:00]  the commercials  there's some of the  best stuff  is in a Geico commercial  or what's the one  with Flo  for the other insurance  progressive I hate her  I hate her  I hate her  but you know her  instantly  and then in a city  of sore thumbs  sticking out  is an achievement  in itself  is it not  that is true  but I also recognize  a sore on the genitals  instantly  doesn't mean it's good  and it looks like Flo  it does  it's less irritating  though  I have a rash  back here  it looks like Elvis  we're back live 
[00:47:30]  David Lee Roth  is here with us today  and of course Florentine  now you  wait a second  you know what else  television also needs  and I say this  every time I sit down  and watch  especially at 5 in the morning  when I don't want to upset  the other apartments  and everything  it is a control  that sets  a volume level  for your television  you say 100 dB  well I'm rock and roll  52 dB  whatever  and no matter  what plays  it rings in  at 52 decibels  if you're listening  on your headsets  or it's playing  whatever 
[00:48:00]  because when the commercials  come on  sometimes they blast on  right  or during the actual  movie itself  it turns into  the love seat  and you're having  to get really  really close  and then somebody  shoots  and it's blast  how come nobody  has invented a thing  that just stabilizes  the volume  don't they have that  I thought they did have that  I think I've seen  on an infomercial  there is like a little  contraption you can put  on the back of your TV  and it's supposed to  I think that's to actually  steal the show  I have that  oh is that  for free cable  the FCC was supposed 
[00:48:30]  to pass a law  about that  because they were  putting in the commercials  way too loud  way louder  than the regular  you know that's when  they were blaring  and stuff like that  they put like a  decibel limit on it  but it still happens  so when it blasts on  does it make a better  impression on you  does it stick  more solidly  when that guy  jumps on  and starts screaming  about the chopper  and the chillo  and the snuggie  and one in that  Australian accent  you know who I'm  talking about  absolutely  he's awful  it makes you look  they just want you  to look  that's all they do 
[00:49:00]  again though  I'll never forget  what's his name  none of us know  his name  but you know  instantly who I'm  talking about  he's made an  impression  again in a sea  of people trying  to make an impression  do you know what  they did once  for a drug commercial  they wanted people  to look  it was about  overdose  or whatever it was  is they just  they went silent  they went totally  silent because  they knew that  the lack of noise  would get people  to look at the TV  in a commercial time  okay that works  maybe once  that's like in the  movies when they're  short on budget  and they go 
[00:49:30]  no it's the mystery  of the darkness  we're gonna use  the mystery  of the unseen  you think that  wears thin pretty  quickly  well you can do  it once  you know like  in the movie  the cat people  or whatever  it's all darkness  and what's in the  darkness I don't  fucking know Jim  and it's okay  that works once  then you gotta  come with some  production  right right  so now you're  here to  you're a martial  artist  and it was  an interesting  combination  I practice  Nike jiu jitsu  any trouble  shows up  I put on my  Nikes  I run  do you watch 
[00:50:00]  UFC  oh religiously  oh you do  okay  oh my goodness  do you know  who Anderson Silva  is  of course I know  who Anderson Silva  is  you never know  I have to ask  no no  this is a  real conversation  because is the  UFC gonna replace  boxing  ultimately  is the UFC  gonna replace  professional wrestling  which one will be  the number one  the number two  and number three  these are really  good questions  because it says  more about the  audience  than it does  about the 
[00:50:30]  actual sport  also UFC  professional wrestling  and boxing  are the only  three sports  virtually every  country  every nationality  right  and there's  probably 800  of I don't think  there's 800  languages spoken  in New York City  alone okay  I just saw that  on the TV set  all 800 languages  understand UFC  and they know  who won immediately  you don't need  anything  you don't need  to tally anything  up it's the guy  laying on the floor  that lost  that's what  the fuck  is cricket  right  that's a character  in Disney 
[00:51:00]  right  what's lacrosse  that's a place  in Wisconsin  no these are  popular sports  that are national  sports or whatever  but I don't  understand the rules  we don't have  them in common  I love watching  rugby and I still  don't have any  idea how it's  played I've  actually played  it and I have  no idea  how it's played  you know  so yeah you  think is this  going to take  over but I  think it's already  passing boxing  as far as  boxing will never  go away but I  think this is  kind of becoming  more popular with  people under 21  I don't hear  anybody talking  about boxing  does boxing belong 
[00:51:30]  to a generation  speak to that  because they  take too long  to get to big  matches  there's been too  many bad things  too much corruption  has happened  and too much  bullshit with  matches we  wanted to see  that didn't  happen and I  think with UFC  they're giving you  so many big  matches that  there's too many  people for people  to get excited  about and there's  too many people  for you to lock  on and like  I'm excited with  every other major  UFC thing I'm  like oh I gotta go  like I love so  many of the things  they're doing  six or seven a  year I'm dying  to go to  and the fighting  style too is so 
[00:52:00]  much more relatable  and because when  you watch boxing  you're thinking in a  real life scenario  why aren't you  kicking  why aren't you  relatable to what  two in the morning  about four blocks  south of here  yes because I'm  going to agree  with that  I will concur  you put down the  Red Bull and go  what'd you fucking  say  and it looks a lot  more like Anderson  Silva on a winning  streak  if you're lucky  it does ring that  bell  it's a lot closer  boxing is really  stylized 
[00:52:30]  we know from when  we would imitate  the guys in the  1800s with the  big mustache  and everything  and you kind of  put your hands up  like this and you  put your little  finger up like when  you're holding a  teacup and it's  John L. Sullivan  or Gentleman Jim  or those kinds of  82 rounds of  whatever  I'm going to wonder  if boxing is now  a part and parcel  for example of  classic rock  generation  maybe  clearly  Jolton Joe  Fraser  you know  and all of his 
[00:53:00]  legends  why was Fraser's  left so strong  because his father  had no left arm  grew up on a farm  and every time  they had to handle  those 55 gallon  milk cans  Joe got to use  his left arm  so by the time  he was in 8th grade  he could leave  some serious divots  in the heavy bag  with that left arm  it was 2.5 sizes  bigger than his  right  there's no magic  to that  what would you  have to watch  boxing or UFC  though  which for you  is more exciting  to watch  depends on the  personality  good question 
[00:53:30]  depends on the  personality  of the individual  let's dial around  the time zone  here  things are getting  all wavy  I should eat  breakfast  we go back  to Muhammad Ali  and Sonny Liston  you know  that's like a  prison yard fight  with one howling  screaming guy  who was probably  closer to  professional wrestling  he admitted  since then  he was imitating  gorgeous George  the wrestler  Muhammad Ali  was  I'm the greatest  I'm the beautifulest  I'm the prettiest  and it sounds like  you know 
[00:54:00]  one of the guys  from WWE  do you remember  that fight  Sonny Liston  was not good  at the back and forth  he was not good  at going back and forth  and he tried to  you know  bet your money  on Sonny  you ever see that video  of Sonny Liston  trying to come back  at Ali verbally  and it was just  kind of humiliating  I had  you had to listen  to it on a radio  you had not even  started closed circuit  in the movie theaters  yet  that came a little  bit later  and I had one  of the early  little black and white 
[00:54:30]  little  or first  Sonny radios  okay  and you had one  of those little  earplugs  that looks more  like a hearing aid  just fit into one ear  you did like that  and those made  so much noise  that you still  had to hide  under the covers  to listen to it  and there were  two fights  between Ali  and Liston  and in one  of them  you know  Liston  quote unquote  through the fight  you know  he was involved  when you know  he was all mobbed up  all of boxing  is and was  you know  but he played  the silent  deadly menacing  thug on the  prison yard role 
[00:55:00]  and Ali  had not started  his you know  in support of  the Nation of Islam  well yeah  he was Cassius Clay  so he was still  an uppity  N word  you know  and that infuriated  everybody  and that just  you know  we fell in love  with him  as little hippies  are you kidding  as little rock  and rollers  are you kidding  what could possibly  represent us better  unless maybe it was  Jimi Hendrix  and I'm prepared  to argue that  that's  the fight you're  talking about  that they thought  Ali threw  I mean  that the  listen through  that's like  the phantom punch 
[00:55:30]  they call  that was the  second fight  and when you  look at slow motion  like they've  slowed that down  enough  you could see  Ali hit him  so hard  that he physically  lifted Liston up  like he  that second punch  he really did  clock him  but it looks like  it was so fast  it looks like  he just kind of  faked it  and fell down  but I've seen  that slow down  and you can see  Ali hits him  so hard  that Sonny  lifts up  like he really  fucking  Ali was in  on this too  or was it  just Liston  that was in  on it  with the  fix  it actually  wasn't a fix  oh what  I thought it was  that's urban legend 
[00:56:00]  I think Liston  was in jail  and then somebody  threw him off  a balcony  later  he died  young man  stories  I don't want  to get in  the way  of a good  rumor  he was a  he was a  fucking  Sonny Liston  was a dock  worker  he was an  enforcer  on the docks  in Philly  or wherever  he was  he was a  tough  fucking  guy  not a lot  of heavyweight  champions  out of Hebrew  school  huh  no  not a lot  of heavyweight  champions  graduating out  of bar mitzvah  class  Philly's a  fucking  rough place  man  I mean  Sonny Liston 
[00:56:30]  Joe Frazier  Meldrick Taylor  Bernard Hopkins  there's a lot  of great  fighters  that come  Rocky  you know  what  that's  interesting  that out  of all  those  faces  and everything  the one  guy who  gets the  attention  is the  Italian  stallion  I've been  practicing that  it's excellent  three syllables  one solid  slamming  career  so it depends  on the  personalities  now let's  say today  I don't  know 
[00:57:00]  I don't  know  who's got  the  personality  I saw  Tyson  doing the  promotion  for his  fight  that he's  promoting  and he  had more  pizzazz  and lightning  and thunder  than the  two guys  that he was  promoting  did you see  any of this  he's even  pushing them  going  come on  I'm hesitant  to imitate him  in case I run  into him  Floyd Mayweather's  got personality  Floyd Mayweather  does  even Pacquiao  he's fun to  watch but he  doesn't  you know  there's a  humility they 
[00:57:30]  don't have  that the UFC  guys do  there's something  really  like they  don't really  like Shale  has a great  personality  Anderson's  kind of quiet  Shale's  another one  just like  Dave was  saying  that he's  doing  wrestling  shtick  when he's  out there  he's doing  the same  thing Ali  was doing  it's fun  to watch  Manny Pacquiao  now because  he has  carried with  him the  friction  of time  on his  shoulders  is his  wife's  career  a 92  person  entourage  do you  follow  he has  now he's  a governor  he's a  senator  he's involved 
[00:58:00]  in charity  you follow  and this is  a classic  story  is all of  a sudden  you know  you are  in demand  and how  much of  those doorbells  do you  answer  you follow  it's like  when you  watch on  MTV  I haven't  watched  recently  but you  could see  a lot of  time  the girls  they get  a brand  new cute  little gal  you know  would be  a VJ  and in  about  90 days  which is  metric for  three months  she gets  what's called  dinner butt  and that's  because now  she's in  demand  oh well  drop by  for dinner  drop by 
[00:58:30]  for drinks  after dinner  drop by  for some  dessert  after drinks  after dinner  and you know  your pant size  expands  after a while  and that's  happening to  Manny  is that  Manny  has so many  distractions  and so many  other things  pushing  you only have  so many calories  per day  that you're  going to be  able to  focus on  any given  thing that  you do  and I think  it's showing  up in his  fight game  I think he's  a fabulous  fighter  he's certainly  how old  is he  Jesus  he's in  his early  30s  is he not  I thought  he was older  than that  Pacquiao  maybe you might 
[00:59:00]  be right  I don't follow  boxing  I used to  Dave makes  a good point  because that's  why the sports  teams never  repeat the next  season  most of the  time because  they have that  off season  where they're  doing all  this stuff  they just  want the  Super Bowl  or the  World Series  and they're  doing all  these personal  appearances  and then  there's not  the next year  they always suck  and then the  year after that  they play good  again and they  win a Super Bowl  or a World Series  there's only so  many calories  that you can  possibly spend  you know you  only have so  much focus  power  and it's the  product of being  that single  minded obsession 
[00:59:30]  you know  it's the one  thing that  everybody tells  you oh you  gotta reach out  to other people  you gotta become  part of the  community  you have to  have a family  you have to  be you know  affiliate with  other folks  and everything  when it was  the single  minded obsession  to the point  of becoming  a fucking  hermit  that got  you the  heavyweight  title  or the  platinum  record  or that  allowed  you to  write  the  Pulitzer  prize winning  novel  or what  have you  what do they 
[01:00:00]  call it  the sophomore  jinx  for like a  second album  or whatever  it is  now how  come that  didn't happen  with a band  like Van Halen  or any big  band when you  guys are on  top  everything  you know  parties at  Studio 54  private planes  how do you  come back  from that  huge tour  put another  great album  out go do  another huge  tour where  you guys  don't lose  a little  I think  that's a good  question  is most  artists and  I've been told  this by folks  who are part  of the setup  the lighting  crew the  carpenters  the staging  even the 
[01:00:30]  wardrobe  folks the  gals who do  all of this  and they say  just recently  one of the  gals said  to me  Dave you're  one of the  few artists  I work with  who actually  enjoys all  of the  preparation  and the  setup  and the  in-between  most of the  people she  said that I  work with  and she works  with all the  big ones  you know  all the biggies  with no last  name  the Madonna  Beyonce  Dave  all the hot  chicks  all the  verbs  Sting  Cher  Usher  these are  verbs 
[01:01:00]  and she said  for the most  part most folks  don't do anything  until about  eight weeks  before that  tour  about six  eight weeks  before that  album  about six  eight weeks  before you  launch the  play on  Broadway  or start  shooting  for the  movie  you practice  with your  sword  or your  ray gun  or your  motorcycle  whatever it  is you signed  up to portray  in the film  but that most  of the folks  who are doing  those pursuits  don't really  enjoy it  beyond that  it's very  finite  and in Van Halen 
[01:01:30]  I wouldn't be  surprised if right  now this evening  the fellas get  together and start  jamming  they do at least  three times a week  sometimes four  and five  just because  that's what we  do  good writers  write  right  you know  good singers  sing  and the band  gets together  and works  routinely  I routinely  am working  lyrics  it's a muscle  that is perishable  like gun handling  or cooking  if you don't do it  you lose it  how do you  can we ask you a  question  because there's  something about  Sabbath  where they said  Ozzy would get  a beat  and he would 
[01:02:00]  just kind of  start singing  ridiculous lyrics  over just to  get a singing  tempo down  will you come  up with something  and go okay  this is what I  want the song  to be  or will they  come up  with a riff  and go hey  do you have  anything for this  or does it  work both ways  it can work  a number of  good a number  of different ways  if the music  comes first  I'll work that  out with you  know whoever  I've written  with a variety  of folks  and then from  that you'll  either try  something rhythmic  to it  you know  you just  then you'll  try to put  the words  to the rhythm  you've created  something like 
[01:02:30]  what could  that be  I don't know  I pledge allegiance  to the flag  great  do something  like that  you came up  with the rhythm  first  or you wrote  those lyrics  long before  the music  ever happened  and you know  you'll find  the emotional  content that's  happening in a  given piece  of music  and then from  that hopefully  you have a  whole repertoire  of you know  different songs  and titles  and subject  matter  and so forth  that you know  it's like  when you take  a racehorse  into the blacksmith  he's going to  take a look 
[01:03:00]  at your horse  and go okay  well he's a little  different over here  you know what  I know just the shoe  and then I'll bend  it a little here  and I can kind  of tweak it there  what distance  is he running  what's the subject  matter so to speak  you know  like that  and the way  that you write  lyrics  can happen  a number of  different ways  as well  we all love  to believe  that Jesus  speaks to us  I am but  the conduit  you've heard  that horse shit  yeah  I sit in the room  and it just  comes to me  yeah well  what's been  coming to you  is moon in June 
[01:03:30]  rhymes with  when's it going  to happen  soon  nice  I'm going to  eat it with  a knife  oh fuck  how much time  do I have  a fork  it's June  soon  I'm going to  eat it with  a spoon  oh that's  excellent  and you write  that down  and you wind  up with that  you know  over and over  put your hands  in the air  like you just  don't care  is what happens  when you just  sit on the stool  by yourself  in the room  and hope 
[01:04:00]  that the fates  deal with you  the gods  do not punish  you with a  lightning bolt  but with time  time extended  time wasted  and of course  my favorite  your time's up  here's a better  way to do it  here's a much  better way to do it  and again  there's no magic  to this  none of this shit  miracles itself  into place  I have  notebooks  that I'll keep  some of them  I've had  for over 20  years  and as I hear 
[01:04:30]  little parts  and parcel  of conversation  you know  part and parcel  just write that  down  sounds like  a song title  you follow  and maybe  there's lyrics  you know  I just saw  a bumper sticker  it said  no talent  no skills  just heart  sounds like  a pickup truck  to me  who's driving  the pickup truck  there's your story  okay  somebody  I saw it  on a movie  she's a grade B  cowboy movie  or something  the fella says  to the young  to the school  marmal  I ain't that smart  man but I sure  can lift heavy 
[01:05:00]  thanks  there's one of your  first lines  in the song  yeah  but you won't  know all of that  until you have  a fat notebook  full of  you know  bits and pieces  of what people  say  things from the  movies  bumper stickers  things from  sports advertisements  and you can  let them age  too  you know  if you get  something out  of a sports  advertisement  let it go  for 10 years  or whatever  and bring it  back  I think it was  for Nike  or Adidas  it says  when was the  last time  you did 
[01:05:30]  something  for the first  time  that sounds  like some  Buddhist shit  to me  it's a good  way to kick  off the weekend  certainly a great  way to sell  shoes  10 years later  nobody even  cares where  that came from  and you sampled  it  this is a big  year for sampling  get with it  do you have  any  modern  do you have  any stuff  Eminem does  that a lot  he'll bring up  stuff  he'll bring  Pee Wee Herman  he was  members like  two albums  ago he was  bringing up  Pee Wee Herman  stuff  stuff that was  from 15 years  ago  you can bring  up expressions  that people  have used  bang zoom  to the moon  like from 
[01:06:00]  the honeymoon  to the moon  Alice  that right there  could well  be a  you know  well not  hip I'd use  that for  electronica  you know  for ghost  writing  for something  like that  you know  bang zoom  parentheses  to the moon  remix  there you go  but you ain't  going to be  able to have  that off the  top of your  head  especially under  the pressure  with all  everybody  all the  neckties  looking through  the window  and the clock  on the clubhouse  wall goes  10,000  10,500  10,580 
[01:06:30]  dollars  right  the clock  will speak  to you  if you're not  careful  is there anything  you've wanted  to make work  I've written  jokes that just  never took form  is there anything  you've written down  or something you  thought had some  potential that you've  just in all these  years never been able  to make work  or like fuck  I had that little  thing I thought I  could do something  with and it was  just a momentary  thing that was  never been able  to be made  only if you don't  do compiling  it's called  compiling  and it's the way  you would prepare  for a legal case  a debate  it's the way 
[01:07:00]  that you would  prepare for an  ultimate fighting  contest you follow  you're going to get  all of your chops  and all of your  ideas in advance  so that it all  becomes second  and third nature  and if you're  stuck on a subject  for example  I like to  I have an inner voice  I have several  of them actually  and one of them  is one of my  old teachers  from social sciences  he sounds like  he's talking to us  in film class  he used to walk  up and down  the aisles  with his hands 
[01:07:30]  behind his back  and go gentlemen  all of us  were 12 years old  gentlemen  today we're going  to write a poem  about a chair  and everybody  would groan  oh fuck  can we write  about what goes  on in the chair  snigger snigger  laugh  yeah certainly  if it's done  poetically  Mr. Roth  so I give myself  little challenges  sometimes  and I wrote  a song about  a chair  okay  pick us  the most  difficult subjects  that you possibly  can  and if you  compile your 
[01:08:00]  ideas  before you  sit down  to nail the  shoe onto  the horse  so to speak  then you're  never going  to get that  rider's ride  you mean like  a chair is hard  a chair is steady  or a chair is full  all of these  facts about a chair  almost  or these different  random thoughts  about a chair  that you could  somehow compile  into a final thing  well I wrote down  what's my favorite  chair  I like those  plastic ones  that just come  in one piece  and everybody  owns a couple  they sit on  every porch  they're in  every white  trash backyard  they're at  every beach  every club  man you know  they stack  them vertically 
[01:08:30]  so the title  of my song  is one piece  thermal molded  country plastic  chair  okay  and I wrote  down lyrics  you know  I wrote down  little bits  and fragments  about  well I like  the green ones  they make me  feel tropical  the white ones  are basic model  I like that  you know  and like  where do  prophets go  prophets used  to go up  to sit on top  of the mountain  ain't no mountains  around here  this is New York  you sit in a  one piece  thermal molded  country plastic  chair 
[01:09:00]  upon a fucking  roof  if you're lucky  to be close  to the roof  and have a key  to the door  you're a prophet  right  and I start  to put all  of these ideas  down onto the paper  do you follow  and then when  it's time  to start putting  your rhymes  together  you have  a whole lot  more ideas  you have many  more ideas  and there ain't  no mountain  around here  sit quietly  by the river  of life  you hear that  shit from all  these fake  Buddhists all  the time  what river  the east river  write that down 
[01:09:30]  what fucking river  question mark  because you can  have that  you know  and I've done  I'm going to say  more Van Halen  songs than not  in that  I also ghost write  for other people  and have for a  number of years  you know  and you can  change  the style  you can  change  the tone  the temperament  you're never  going to have  writer's block  if you're doing  that  if you're trying  to think of  an explanation  for something  you just can't  keep throwing  yourself at it 
[01:10:00]  you know  compile the ideas  like you would  for a debate  yeah  that makes sense  now if you  come in the room  as a lyricist  and come in a room  with personal lyrics  and the rest of the band  looks at you like  Dave  can you come up  with something  better  or you know  this is kind of  these lyrics  really don't fit  this music  what happens  there  it's pretty rare  it's pretty rare  so they're pretty cool  you come in  to it  now you know  if you're  if you are  lyrically  if you're 
[01:10:30]  dialed into the lyrics  you know  a lot of people  are you know  Bob Dylan fans  will tell you  probably number one  on the list  is the lyrics  number two  is the melody  and whatever  you know  in material like  Van Halen  you don't have to  speak English  as a first language  at all  it's probably  even better  like Stravinsky  said you know  my music's best  understood by animals  and small children  well my music  is best purchased  by animals  historically  because you don't  have to speak English  so you can't  can't fool you  with it  it's authentic 
[01:11:00]  in its confidence  it's authentic  in its sense of humor  it's authentic  in its sense  of confrontation  and you can sense  that you know  you're not fooled  by the language  or whatever  but they're very real  stories there  and there's a lot  of questions  that are presented  you know  I wrote a song  on this last record  about tattooing  and on the surface  it sounds like  another girl's cars  let's party  or whatever  but it asks a whole  lot of questions  like why is the crazy  shit we would never 
[01:11:30]  say become poetry  in ink  ah  you know  there's a whole lot  if you care about it  you can delve in  if not  you don't have to  pay attention  to the lyrics  at all  like I said  Van Halen music  works perfectly  even if you don't  speak English  at all  we are equally  as reviled  and celebrated  internationally  as we are  in English  speaking neighborhoods  you know  now I'm thinking  about personal lyrics  though  because like  there's this  one of my favorite  Pink Floyd songs  is called  When the Tigers  Broke Free  a personal 
[01:12:00]  I think Roger Waters  about his father  being killed  in the war  and it didn't  make the original  album  and the reason  that was given  was it was just  too personal  and I'm like  that must have  been so offensive  to come in  with a song  about something  that means so much  that the other  whatever happened  and they said  it just doesn't fit  and I'm like  how do you deal  with that  if someone has  something that  means so much  to them  but it doesn't  reach the other  band members  I like the first  part first  it was just  so personal  that it couldn't 
[01:12:30]  be played  that was what  their reason  was  it was so  personal  that I can't  let you listen  to it  now we're  entering into  spinal tap turf  the band  didn't like it  it's the best  song I've ever  written  but it's so  personal  I can't play  it for you  do you think  they said that  because they  didn't like it  I think they  said that  because they're  full of Groucho  marks  you enter  into this  turf of  what was his  routine about  I put together  a band 
[01:13:00]  and we charged  only so much  for when we  played  turns out  we're more  popular when  we don't  play  so I had  to charge  more when  we don't  play  now when  we don't  play  we don't  rehearse  you can run  into some  serious money  if we don't  play and we  don't rehearse  and it turns  you don't  understand  Jimmy  so personal  that I  couldn't  barely record  it  that's  bullshit  that was  what Roger  Waters said  that the  band's  reason was  for not  wanting to  put it  on the  record  was that  it was  too specific  to him 
[01:13:30]  or whatever  so they probably  just didn't like  the song  maybe they just  didn't like the song  okay  yeah well it  sounds like he  may be making  okay I  understand  he's creating  another reason  okay  and maybe it  wasn't up to  par but as far  as being too  personal  how is that  possible  with artists  out there  like peaches  the teachers  of peaches  and all of this  kind of stuff  there's no way  you could be  too personal  you know  some of the  stuff that  Springsteen  has created 
[01:14:00]  out there  there's no way  you can get  too personal  you know  in any department  of your life  social  sexual  political  or whatever  so maybe the  rest of the band  just didn't like  the fucking song  and that was  what they said  like that's  just too specific  to you  yeah  and you know  it's all  god  the more  personal  it is  what  what is it  that really  sells the music  if you don't  speak the language  is that it's  authentic  that it's  confident  and that  it's  it is  personal 
[01:14:30]  to you  if it's  not real  if it's  fake  you're making  it up  you're pretending  to be a cowboy  and you ain't  no cowboy  professional  detractors  like ourselves  will pick up  on that  pretty quickly  yo  what about  when you're  doing  how much  can a good  or bad  producer  I'm obsessed  with the new  Sabbath record  as is Jim  and we credit  a lot of that  stop right there  why are you  obsessed with it  it's so much  better  than I imagined  it could be  I love the lyrics  I love the tone  I love the music  I love all of it 
[01:15:00]  ok well the good  campfire story is  why did you imagine  it would be so much less  because they haven't  done one since 1978  so it was almost  like the last  Van Halen record  you guys didn't do  one for a long time  and the last  Van Halen record  could fit in  between Van Halen 2  and Women and Children  first  and where does  the Sabbath record  fit in  it could fit in  1971  1970 right after  Master Reality  between Paranoid  and Master Reality  and are the songs  quality  I understand  fucking amazing  I understand  that the shoes  and haircut  are correct 
[01:15:30]  that it fits  the neighborhood  but then there's  such a thing  as the good  stuff from  that time period  and the not so  good  all the bands  have it  we all do that  but this is good  material  that's what it was  it's almost like  if you go out  with a girl  and she's very  pretty  and you can't  believe  that she's just  going to want to  blow you over  and over  like oh my god  that's how I felt  with this record  it was that  fucking good  everything about it  is more than  I had ever hoped  let's retrace this  I love Dave's face  when you talk  we're running 
[01:16:00]  past great  we just ran  past Mount Rainier  you're asking  why did I not  expect it to be  not that I didn't  expect it  but almost like  it was too good  to be true  that I would love  it as much  you always expect  it to be garbage  because most of us  turn out to be fat  idle indolent slobs  who no longer  pick up their instruments  unless it's time  to make a dollar  they usually lost  their dollar  which is the only  reason they're 
[01:16:30]  coming back  they're no longer  in contact  with anything  that's happening  outside  and I'm not  speaking specifically  about Sabbath  but the general  rule of thumb  is that you are  a product of a  neighborhood  whether you know  it or not  when you're  opening act  for a million  other shows  and you're hearing  the music coming  through those brick  walls  as you're warming  up  if you're working  in clubs  and bars  and it's particularly  the people you  can't stand  and you hate  that you learn  the most from  you know  as a critic  you know  you find your way  you find your shape 
[01:17:00]  like that  ultimately  I call it  well I don't call it  it's called  the friction of time  you know  a family  friends  medical  travel  age  itself  wealth  the lack of wealth  too much wealth  that's one of your favorites  you know  etc  like a big yoke  on somebody's shoulders  it slows down  and it kills the artist  they literally gain weight  lose the height  in their voice  there walks a lady  we all know  that's a product 
[01:17:30]  of the gut son  that's not magic  it's not miracle  it's what you ate  for breakfast  and more importantly  what you shouldn't  debate  if you're going to  hit that high note  I suggest you hit  the fucking high note  based on how much  you charge for tickets  these days  and that applies  to myself  now I'm sort of  on a tangent here  but we always expect  the very worst  because these are  perishable skills  however  you can sing  the high note  in Stairway to Heaven  all the way up  into your 70s  if you keep  your horses running  you follow 
[01:18:00]  and most of us  don't do that  not past the age  of 35  I expect the worst  or not  because I never  want to be disappointed  but I'm like that  with everything  with everything  in my life  whether it's a date  you just never  want to be disappointed  in anything  so I don't really  I don't have  a specific thing  whether it's for music  or a movie  or a comedian  I just don't want  to just have that  and you want  it to be  like in your heart  you want it to be  so good  because you love  Sabbath  you love them  it was almost like  the first 5-6  Van Halen records  up to 1984 
[01:18:30]  you guys were  in a zone  touring  put out great music  not a bad song  on any of those records  then you guys  go away for a long time  are you still  back in that zone  same thing with  Sabbath  with Ozzy  those 8 records  with Ozzy  were just phenomenal  one after another  and then they're gone  for so long  can you bring  that magic back  well wait  Ozzy lives  in his own little world  you know  what's the joke  I live in my own  little world  at least they know  me there  so leave a message  right  since he has  since Ozzy  is diagonally  parked in a  parallel universe 
[01:19:00]  permanently  and always has been  he kind of never  left  so let's look  at the other  members of the band  but is the magic  still there  I know  the only thing  that changed  with Ozzy  was the haircuts  and some new ink  on the left arm  right  but I mean  the magic of them  together  you know  the rest of the guys  Tony and Geezer  and Bill  were playing  and other stuff  you know  doing other projects  working with Ronnie James  Dio  so they were out  everyone was playing  just like you were playing  but when you guys  got the band  maybe it's the word  playing 
[01:19:30]  you know  there's a difference  between playing  and obsessive  determined chasing  you know  when you're chasing  something  you may not even  be able to articulate  what you're chasing  but you are obsessed  with it  all musicians  will tell you that  so will all  boxers  architects  ballet dancers  you follow  doctors  in medical school  etc  you know  there's a single-minded  obsessive  that goes  it's not playing  it's a determined  chase 
[01:20:00]  like your life  depends on it  maybe it really does  you follow  and  a lot of that  comes from  well you know  this is funny  I sat around  with a bunch of  these young guys  who started  sumo wrestling  you know  I lived in Japan  for the last year  there  are you back here  by the way  you still have in  no no  completed my year  overseas  I'm back  and there were  half a dozen  of these guys  they're actually  they start living  there like  SEAL team guys  in dorms and stuff  when they're about  16 years old  you know  we went around 
[01:20:30]  the circle  they said  we had dinner  together  you know  with all these  new fighters  you know  whatever  and  you know  this is  what motivates you  expecting me  to do the usual  Japanese horseshit  of honor  family  determination  for the best  excuse me  I almost fell asleep  here  I don't know  I'm motivated  by fear  and revenge  primarily  greed  if I can get  past the first two  but dynamics  Jim talked about 
[01:21:00]  dynamics  wait  maybe Sabbath  has some fear now  you did  you stopped  fucking around  when you  get a little  fear back  in the breakfast  bowl  every morning  you know  you get a little  older  you get  medical issues  you know  our guitar player  friend there  is not  what  he's got cancer  he has not  this is a public  scenario  you know  it's not something  that's a secret  and  you are driven  by those two  things  you know 
[01:21:30]  it's not  cool to say it  but we are  supremely  motivated  by fear  and revenge  and when you  lose those  something happens  to your music  something happens  to your dancing  your lyrics  it happens  to your prose  something happens  to your politics  something happens  to your warrior  arts  you follow  and  it's very rare  that you'll hear  somebody say it  you know  usually you reach  for the  no it's in the  pursuit of the  greater goal  of no no no  I just feel like  my wristwatch  is about to kick 
[01:22:00]  my ass  because it's  moving so much  faster  than my lower  back and my  left knee  and I sure  wish I have  some revenge  on those  prick fucks  who are still  paying me  six cents  a record  I want to go  out and make  another better  record  and make a  little better  royalty  so fuck  you in the  back of my  history  that's a little  revenge  and these are  part of the  things that  motivate us  in the band  in Van Halen  you follow  and maybe  Sabbath got a  little bit  of that back  and it  compels  it has a  healthy  drive form 
[01:22:30]  to it  as a positive  side of it  like competition  you know  coming out of  the Woodstock  era  you know  one world  one love  we're here  just be happy  to get along  I don't know  competition  brings out  it sharpens  the axe  blade  equally  on other  sides  nothing  stirs the  blood  quite so much  as the  trumpet  that heralds  another guy's  achievement  like the  guy who's  on stage  right  fucking  now  whoa  he's  killing 
[01:23:00]  it  out  there  no  I  can't  talk  anymore  I gotta  warm up  and you  can you  know  you learn  that as  well  you know  these are  elements  that you  usually  don't talk  about  in public  what did  you just  say  that was  really  about  nothing  something  like  another  guy's  achievement  that's  interesting  about  like  almost  like  nothing  motivates  you  more  than  or  someone  more  than  another  guy  doing  really  well  you hear  fuck  that  trumpet  and  fuck  you  Bob  you 
[01:23:30]  know  and  this  compels  this  will  compel  you  through  law  school  and  medical  school  this  will  compel  you  as  a  downtown  canvas  and  ink  paint  artist  this  will  compel  you  as  a  dancer  whether  you're  ballet  or  breaking  this  will  compel  you  in  all  of  the  fine  arts  that's  my  only  area  of  expertise  but  you  know  even  in  fist  to  face  confrontation  you  know  the  best  friends  the  best  brothers  you  saw  that  movie  about  Mickey  Ward 
[01:24:00]  with  Wahlberg  and  there  you  go  you  know  there's  a  constant  push  and  pull  constant  competition  between  those  fellas  that  ultimately  brought  out  the  best  and  solved  a lot  of  issues  for  both  of  them  you  know  but  we  don't  talk  about  that  usually  I  just  saw  an  interview  with  Carole  King  you  know  tapestry  you  know  okay  nothing  could be  more  winsome  and  transparent  and  more  folk  soggy 
[01:24:30]  or  whatever  you  know  what  she  said  she  said  man  I  used  to  work  at  the  goddamn  Brill  building  said  there  were  92  pianos  in  little  rooms  there  and  you  had  to  compete  to  win  not  just  to  write  a  good  song  but  if  you  didn't  beat  everybody  else  at  writing  an  amazing  song  you  went  home  fucking  hungry  she  says  i'm  glad  i  went  through  that  she  said  it  got  the  very  best  out  of  me  and  i  don't  care  whether  you're  catching  a  football  or  a  drift  on  a  really  good  chorus  i think  that adds  up  certainly  did  for  Van Halen 
[01:25:00]  fair and  revenge  great  motivated  yeah  i mean  absolutely  i mean  you guys  it was  the sabbath  and the  van halen  thing is  pretty much  parallel  you guys  both being  away  for a  long  time  getting  the  guys  back  putting  an  album  out  and  doing  a  sell  out  tour  and  putting  out  a  great  product  well  yeah  it's  you know  i think  you don't  miss the  water  till the  well  runs  dry  all right  like  ozzy  never  never  changed  he lives  in his  own  little  world  all right  um  so he  never  really  left  i think 
[01:25:30]  perhaps  some of  the other  fellas  just from  word  around  the  campfire  from  what  i  can  tell  uh  you  you  don't  it's  not so  much  gentrify  as you  normalize  you get  married  you have  kids  you're going  to the  pta  meetings  now you  have  vacations  if your  wife works  she's got  two weeks  vacation  where are  we going  we're going  to  down the  shore  we're going  to the  club  man  we're going  to  and you  start  to  normalize  you follow  it's a  normal world  we're the 
[01:26:00]  ones who  are abnormal  um  and there's  always that  push and  pull  you know  to uh  to join  the clan  you follow  and uh  when you do  a lot of times  it turns out  that your rage  and your craziness  was way more  interesting than  the real you  you think we  touched on this  before when last  time i was here  and we were  talking about  some of the  fellows who  come out of  rehab  and it's great  that they're  still alive  and it's great  that you know  we've saved  another human  being but  jesus christ  man you were  way more  interesting  when you were  all fucked up 
[01:26:30]  see it's weird  because for me  like i was  single i got  married at 47  was my first  marriage and i had  a kid at 47  too so it's  i was always  like i can't  get any work  done if i'm  married and i  got a kid and  i have to go to  pta meetings and  change diapers and  and watch them and  stuff but meanwhile  since i've gotten  married i've done  a hundred times more  work in my career  because i'm totally  focused on that  i'm a hundred but  you know i've  gotten so much  more work done  because i know  those little  moments i have  i gotta focus  those two out  that two hour  window before i  would just get up  at 11 in the  morning i'm like  i got all day to 
[01:27:00]  do whatever and i  would just not  i was only 50  percent productive  you gotta be  you have to  obsess if you  really want to  compete it's going  to take a big  chunk out of your  normal real life  you know and  we always act  surprised you know  well jesus the  divorce rate amongst  really good policemen  is 80 percent  what a surprise  oh the divorce rate  against successful  musicians is a 90  percent wow what a  surprise successful  politician and the  list is long but 
[01:27:30]  the only thing i don't  accept anymore is the  surprise how can you  be fucking surprised  anymore it's like when  we see these baseball  players taking drugs  and doing steroids  stop the only thing i  will not accept is  your surprise yeah  everybody in the half  the people in these  hallways here are  taking a prescription  meds all and half the  people downstairs actually  own those prescriptions  right so you don't  like the fake outrage  or the fake shock or  the fake surprise that  people uh why do you 
[01:28:00]  think people do it why  do you think they  would act surprised  because it's fun to be  outraged it's fun you  know just ask the french  you know and you can  throw up your hands and  you know oh my god you  put your hand you to  your forehead it's like  every time some dame  kisses another girl on  the mtv awards show we  have to act surprised  you know how many  times has that been  going on it gives you  something to tweet  about it gives you  something to have an  opinion on sure you  know something to bring  up at a party well  that's when it becomes 
[01:28:30]  fine art art is where  you're figuring out  where you are in the  map okay you see  somebody walk out on  that tv screen and you  go i wouldn't wear  those shoes but the  haircut's cool and you're  like on a map and you  go okay that's where i  am on the haircut map  okay who's he fucking  oh nice chick she's  pretty smart i like  smart chicks okay now  you know where you are  with that one right  there you know like  this but he's got a  drug problem well what  kind of drugs and you  start calibrating yourself 
[01:29:00]  more than anything else  and that's what we use  characters like myself and  characters like politicians  and characters like the  kardashians you know our  favorite uh football players  and our really unfavorite  actors etc this it's fun  to talk about yeah just  imagine dave used to have  his bodyguards were  midgets imagine if that  was in the paper today  like a page six that he's  walking around you know  dave everybody would be  offended well you can't  even call them that now  i know little people 
[01:29:30]  dwarfs or whatever they  were yeah and used to  walk in the studio 54  with three of them behind  them walking in making a  big scene and it was  awesome well it depends  are these little people  are these ethnic little  people you know i i don't  think that little people  is a big issue okay i  think that there is a  whole lot of politics  involved in what you're  involved in now okay in  terms of music etc you know  the economy is upside down 
[01:30:00]  you got a lot of issues  like gun control and it  seems like a lot of the  way you vote goes along  with the neighborhood if  you wear a cowboy hat then  you're just supposed to vote  a certain way make sense  you know if you don't  then you have you're  supposed to vote another  way and uh when did  music become uh one type  of politics when did show  business become one style  of uh one one single  approach you know um are  you guys gun owners for  example no no no and no 
[01:30:30]  well i'm carrying one right  now how'd you get it up here  no it's it's drawn on there  actually  strap strap for life you  know one shot one love i  don't believe in high high  capacity magazines and you  know my version of gun  control is um i get to have  guns in anybody that i  certify personally sure i  think that's everybody's  that's technically that's  everybody's version but  people just don't say it 
[01:31:00]  that honestly that's what we  all feel yeah but you know  times are crazier than ever  out there so you know it's  uh where does it say that  whatever neighborhood or  whatever kind of music like  in heavy metal you're  supposed to be a gun owner  right if you're there's the  surprise move right as i  say you go he's right if i  wear a cowboy hat for a  living and i mean you know  like in showbiz i'm supposed  to be a gun owner right yeah  country singer country yeah 
[01:31:30]  what if i'm what if i'm a  folk singer uh with dreadlocks  and i'm from below 14th street  then i'm left wing and i'm  anti-gun is that accurate yeah  fairly what if i was born in  tel aviv israel uh-oh  but if you know if you got  good dreadlocks mitigating  factor  no but the same hippie  mentality  you're the same hippie guy  dreadlocks anti-establishment  that means if you you're 
[01:32:00]  probably born israel you're  pro-palestinian if you're that  age you probably think that  israel belongs out of gas  bank that has come full circle  you could be for a pro-palestinian  if you're you know young  israeli guy with the dreadlocks  that's your rebellion it's  probably uh you're angry at the  state of israel i always  wonder how that works now over  there it's you have a  combination of politics that i  don't think is ever going to  get solved you think the  mid-east is ever going to get  solved no no because a lot of  it's based in some of it's  based in politics and some of  it's based in religion i don't 
[01:32:30]  i don't think it's ever going to  get fixed and over land because  you can't you you're never going  to resolve a dispute when people  just want land what kind of land  are you talking are you talking  about the palestini the  palestini and the israelis i  mean that's just i don't see the  i don't see there be ever be  because there's too many  radicals on both sides like  even if there's a peace  somebody will try to bomb a  jews on a bus or somebody will  say fuck it let's build a  settlement here there's always  going to be somebody on either  side who wants to continue even 
[01:33:00]  if they don't know they want to  continue this conflict it's never  going to get solved no i think  it's going to continue and i think  it's going to expand and i think  it's going to i think it's going  to continue to carry over to the  united states i think we're going  to see it more and more in  europe etc i think that as uh oil  starts to run out you know and  as as uh energy and so forth  starts to change around that  we're going to see a whole lot  more activities here but i don't  think anything's going to get  solved in the mid east i agree it  sounds like it's falling apart 
[01:33:30]  even more in egypt and whatnot now  unless we have unless we have  unless as as the oil runs out we  fucking develop an alternative  source i mean we do have a great  power source you know in the sun  and if we really do use that  oh wait a minute wait a minute  did you guys see the thing about  trump where he built his his uh  golf course in in scotland is it  and that was a big issue because  it was a pristine wilderness you  know with cranes and storks and  whatever and uh he got rid of the 
[01:34:00]  sand dunes or something and don't  tell me the gods aren't comedians now  he has these huge windmills that  they've planted into the water out  there each one of them is as tall  as trump tower they make super loud  noises because their turbines each  turbine can power sixty two  thousand uh houses worth of  electricity these are monster  skyscraper size things and they're  going to put dozens and dozens of  them all right off the shore blocking  the shit out of his view and now he's  in contest with that oh that's why 
[01:34:30]  they're doing it to stick it to him  well i gotta wonder if somebody  behind the scenes isn't saying you  know hey look you know if it's a  difference between a quarter of a  mile or uh two clicks in a kilometer  fuck him i was yeah he's always  railing about those i was wondering  why so that that makes sense that  makes sense yeah why he's always  railing about the turbines and all  that stuff yeah it's it's loud it's  not you know environmentally safe  all these he has all these issues  with him i always uh well it's  blocking his view yeah he has a new 
[01:35:00]  uh golf course club with a thing you  know a lodge and a restaurant and  stuff nobody's gonna do those looks  like science fiction when you put  those up doesn't it it looks like he  landed on another planet and that's  you know uh you know battle star  galactica shit or something a lot of  people didn't like that he won that  battle i mean he's a smart guy but a  lot of people did not like that he  won that battle and actually got because  they fought him so hard on even using  that land and he won he got to use  the land so i guess that's their way  of getting some it's like the way 
[01:35:30]  the fucking politicians are keeping  the ufc the unions are keeping the  ufc out of new york by backdooring  through the scumbag uh sheldon  silver and the other politicians  that's what they did not uh they're  mad at the trump that he had this  thing uh built so i fuck in that  backdooring through some scottish  politicians have these things put up  in the water and we'll fuck them  first thing i thought first thing i  thought about there's like 25 miles or  something of space happening there and  now he's got to go through years and  years of dealing in the courts and  litigating i gotta guess you know but 
[01:36:00]  it was beautiful i haven't seen  exactly what it looks like you know  i've seen the work of it before when  it was empty and you know there's just  the guys walking along the empty space  of beach or what have you you know so  this way are you going to the hotline  or no no no no oh you well you had  your hand out that you're trying to grab  the phone do we have to break buddy  it's uh yeah we should uh 7 54 we  should take a break because uh we have  some live reads and then uh we'll come  back and uh you want to mention some  golf yeah yeah you gotta disassemble a 
[01:36:30]  sandu you're right dave i don't know  if you know jim a oh yeah sorry i  forgot my uh two things my special  airs tonight on epics and epics hd.com  at 10 p.m and i'm doing an ama on  reddit at one o'clock thank you sam uh  the ask me anything uh 1 p.m it said  11 30 on reddit's website but it is  actually one o'clock i'll be doing  that he's doing a one-hour comedy  special premieres tonight what happens  in one of your comedy specials please  describe give us an outline of uh of what  happens here a really really uh a very 
[01:37:00]  great great title though american  degenerate yes it's a very funny cold  open an hour of mediocrity and then i  wave thanks good night is this you  speaking is this a speaking issue or are  you doing theater oh no no stand up just  stand up comedy just me for just regular  stand up where did you film this this  sound great uh boston i shot it uh  somerville mass in at the end of march  why did you pick somerville mass i love  boston crowds and uh they've been good  to me my whole career and i've been 
[01:37:30]  dreaming about shooting a special there  because i just i knew that the venue  would sell very fast and i knew that i  would get the response that i really  wanted there's a lot of history in  boston crowds what was the name of the  uh the club there was a very little  club there where a lot of people came  out of and they did even a um a  documentary on was it a comedy club  yeah there was probably it might have  been nicks uh nicks has a great  history there um yeah maybe  garofalo was but was one of the  might have been nicks or played  against sam's was was one uh but i 
[01:38:00]  think nicks comedy club is and you  know david jim had a big problem with  having a smoke machine at a show because  he wanted to open that smoke because  the whole thing with the great white  fire with the lights in rhode island you  can't have any smoke machines in like  boston or something like that on stage  with certain venues if it was that they  found a workaround was a tragedy i can  see the loss of look of loss but you  know what i thought jim wanted that  some you know he wanted like a car  right you wanted smoke when you came  out i thought all not when i came out  but they do it before the show for  certain it gives the light a certain 
[01:38:30]  quality and all the comedy specials do  it they have the smoke not during my  show not to walk out dramatically but  just to give the lights a certain  quality absolutely you do it it's  airborne it doesn't it's called fog  fog yes it doesn't hug the floor right  and what happens is when you float  smoke what looks like smoke or right  or missed through lighting beams you  can actually see the beams but with  first in boston you can't do that there's  all these regulations and so i was  panicking because we already booked the 
[01:39:00]  venue and we couldn't find a workaround  and then i called louis ck actually i'm  like you shot in boston how did you use  these smoke machines and he's like i  never fucking used one of those they're  ridiculous you don't need them and i was  so ashamed i ever wanted one and it  looked much better without one than it  would have with one so i was it worked  out fucking great and uh the special is  on tonight so i hope people like it and  uh you know check out my reddit ama at  one o'clock how long does it take you to  get ready for a special like this how  long does this one took ten months to  from the time i shot the last one till 
[01:39:30]  this one was a ten month window to build  the material and shoot it and uh which  was actually soon normally it would take  about a year but i i was i i have built a  lot of material quickly and uh i was i  was depressed to have to drop the  material okay now we've run into each  other for example down at the comedy  cellar and as you build your material  are you going like modular i don't even  know if that's the right word but you do  it you'll do the first maybe ten minutes  and then do you go run it in front of  people you run it through some ears or  do you just compile just compile you have 
[01:40:00]  uh the whole show and then you test it  for the first time on epics oh no no no i'll  do i'll go out i'll do 15 20 minutes at  a time at the cellar when i feel like i  have about 30 new minutes which is what i  have about now i'll go back on the road i'll  do 30 to 35 new minutes play with the  crowd a little bit all of a sudden i'm at  an hour and then playing with the crowd  i'll get more material then i'll start  working that hour and then in say eight  months that hour will be very solid and  i'll be ready to shoot it and that's kind  of the pattern i'm in where you know i i  start with just the cellar and get that 
[01:40:30]  little it usually takes a couple of  months to get the first few minutes  because i'm stuck i've just dropped an  hour and i'm like what do i do and i'll  go to the real small the b or c rooms to  b or c comedy rooms on the outskirts to  work out to work out not them not the  main rooms not the a where's a b in a c  room what's a holiday inn holiday inn  yeah holiday inn there's a place called  like uh you know we're in scranton  pennsylvania small rooms they got the  banquet room at the holiday inn there's  comedy clubs there it's a perfect it's a  b or c room hi we're sausalito and 
[01:41:00]  jim is going to be up in just a second  work out you play around you let the  crowd know what you're doing yeah it's  fun i love it love that process and then  you go to the improvs which are more  expensive rooms for the audience to get  into so they're paying more money and by  then the hours fairly together and i'm  doing on outsmart chopping and adding  and cut you know how it is it's just so it  takes you about a year do you base your  entire will call it an hour you base your  whole hour on one general subject you 
[01:41:30]  keep returning to that or do you just  start with news of the day and then  compile from there it whatever sparks me  the first time like i can't this this  time it took me two months to get  anything i was just doing dick jokes and i  felt awful about every night i was bombing  having terrible shows and then i went to  my son my friend's son's bris and i'd  fucking shocked me so much to hear this  kid screaming during a circumcision that  i once on stage that night and talked  about it for 20 minutes and it killed  what do you mean it killed you got big 
[01:42:00]  laughs because the emotion with it like  you talked about with the song there was  real emotion there so it was a live event  and i spoke about it honestly and the  crowd laughed so then i i fucking took  some of that and i began working it and  then from there i branched into paula dean  and all the other stuff anthony wiener  anthony wiener fucking uh yeah but  that's how it was but that first honk  was was was was the author the lemon  cookie what is it proust or whatever the  famous the remembrance of things long 
[01:42:30]  past or whatever he bites into the  lemon cookie and he starts uh remembering  his past and it takes him three full  novels worth of remembering before he's  done i think it's called remembrance of  things past or whatever it's famous  classic and do you use television for  that or are you a newspaper junkie or is  it interaction with folks or whatever i'll  preface it with this most of what i'm  getting that i goes into my notebooks my  dog russell you can see him on my twitter  feed and all that shit is a cattle dog 
[01:43:00]  which means he's got real short little  legs it's for ducking under cattle like  so forth squats way lower to the ground  and when we walk before he trots his pace is  real slow so you don't want to trot him his  walking pace is unbelievably slow so when i'm  walking that dog you never question why that  guy is moving so slowly past us you'll just  continue your conversation you'll just continue  critiquing whatever it is you were critiquing and 
[01:43:30]  whatever you'll never even notice me because  that's just the guy walking a dog now if it's  midnight and i'm out by myself you have every  right to be a fared yeah right this guy's  trouble looking for a place to happen you  know like this but with the dog all is  forgiven nobody even blinks right and i walk  just so slow and i'm memorizing everything  because i can speak a couple languages now  too so you know constant moving just slow  slow and i'm going to say 85 percent of what  goes into my notebooks comes from other 
[01:44:00]  people other people arguing what's the old  expression the only one who listens to both  sides of the argument is the neighbors  well i'm one of the neighbors right so most of  what i'm getting is from other folks but i know  folks who write basically from the news you know  who can bring it out of novels and books and what  have you you know where these other people like  uh with the paula dean stuff what bothered me was  everybody's the shock i'm tired of your shock  like oh i don't get your surprise that was that 
[01:44:30]  was what it was the outrage around paula dean  annoyed me so much so on twitter that started to  spark me so i started to attack people's fake  out and that's what it was right it was other  people it was my annoyance at their reaction to  something i didn't buy their reaction so they  start talking about that on stage and i tie that  into circumcision because i'm like american  culture is very odd what we embrace and what  sparks us in a public debate and that's the segue  from circumcision you talk about american culture is  really weird that we embrace circumcision but we don't like clitoral  circumcision and then you go right into fucking paula dean 
[01:45:00]  so you have like a little segue there yeah you know so you know what i mean you  have to tie it together somehow no no you need jim to tie it for you  yeah yeah you have to find some little fucking strand that can string them  together so it may make some kind of sense  or at least for me it's easier to remember when i'm saying it maybe that's  half is i have to remember you know the fucking ankle is connected to the shin  which is connected to that's kind of how i remember and that's what helps me put  together that to to remember to say it how much a comedy is complaining 
[01:45:30]  mine is 150 that's all it is i complain and i'm on stage complaining  sure because there's no there's no really very few funny things in a machine  working but when the machine breaks or when there's a problem that to me is  where the interesting discussion comes in i had a great drive on the way to  work today the sun was out who gives a fuck oh driving to work there was a  fucking accident there was a truck flipped over  really that's the story i want to hear that's what i'm more interested in and 
[01:46:00]  that's what i'm more likely to laugh at i went on a date  we kissed it was magic oh fuck you but i went on a date uh you know i couldn't get a  hard on and uh you know and then she put her teeth in the drawer yeah that's what i want to hear  that's to be where are you going i said i'm gonna sleep with the girl  yeah it's a fine line because you talk about your relationships and you're talking bad about your  wife or women in general because that's what's going on and then people you're sexist you hate 
[01:46:30]  women i'm like no it's just you know yeah my chest acting up what am i gonna i'm not yet we're not  gonna i'm not gonna talk about the walk in the park that we took the other day but you know i've  tried i've tried to explain american humor to the japanese at length okay they don't understand  by and large the general thinking of sarcasm or making fun of each other or busting each other's  chops right or that when you make fun of somebody in a joke you follow that's an insult and that's 
[01:47:00]  never funny if somebody's being insulted the only thing that could possibly be funny to my  short experience there was if something unfortunate that was unpreventable happened to somebody but one  person didn't do it to the right right right if all you want to hear an example sure this was one of  the few jokes that i could come up with that they would laugh at that they would think is funny three  guys they're just an airplane uh crash lands in the desert three guys go wandering in the desert a 
[01:47:30]  blind fella a deaf fella and a fella in a wheelchair do you know this one no they're wandering along all of  a sudden the uh deaf fella says look he says up ahead a sign says magic lake they go running up  to the magic lake the deaf fella jumps into the water pulls his head out he goes fellas you won't  believe it my hearing has returned he says louis to the blind man come into the water drags him into  the water louis throws his head up out of the water says my god my sight has returned they wheel manny  the guy in the wheelchair into the water they pull the wheelchair out bingo the wheelchair has brand 
[01:48:00]  new wheels it's okay because nobody did it to the other guy right right other than god punishing  manny his bad legs and the land of the gods is the land of tears so and this is how the mechanism  actually uh actually works i don't think there's any laughter in heaven i think shit has to go wrong  i think i think the best laughs the best humor comes from when things go wrong and they get worse 
[01:48:30]  then they get worse and then you just gotta laugh yeah it's the only release it's the only way to  draw a sword and and and cleave on to it you follow if i had the crowd groaning after like 10 minutes i go  look there's there's no happy endings with my jokes if you're expecting one just go home and watch a  romantic comedy because they're all my jokes and badly well a lot of a lot of jokes the best  it doesn't have to be wrapped up nicely like everything else like every little movie or  sitcom at the end i don't have to teach a lesson there's no lesson at the end hey it just it it 
[01:49:00]  just ends it peters out and it's like holy shit it fades to black and you go what the fuck just  happened the best stuff you're not sure if you should laugh the best stuff you want to laugh but  you're not sure if you want anybody to see you doing that laugh the best stuff makes you cringe  a little bit makes you kind of squeeze your fist a little bit like why am i laughing uh you know it  causes a lot of questions you follow and the best comedy best humor i'll call it on television is when 
[01:49:30]  you turn off the sound and you can't tell if it's drama or comedy at all you know the best the best stuff  is delivered very straight face there's not a lot of winking and elbows right right right knees and  and that kind of even observational is uh it's uh i think it's very there's it's in subtext it's  very quiet like the best acting not a lot of eyebrows not a lot of you know extra yeah yeah exactly 
[01:50:00]  and and when you see it also on the on the uh when we drive on the freeway you see the giant posters  in uh hollywood you know of the comedians and the fellas who are doing television shows who have  sitcoms and so forth now and uh the fellas were making the big faces with the big popped eyes and  like that don't last very long no you know it's it is the undercurrent do you know it's the 
[01:50:30]  it's the stuff you can't quite tell if this is humor or not it is something that is a nice fine  balance there i think who's got that going these days no the me and jim used to always make fun of  the promos for the uh sitcoms like during a football game or something like that they always used to  show a couple dancing so that would make you go oh they must be having fun it must be a fun show  because the fat guy's dancing with the hot wife so we better tune in because it looks a lot of fun  and it's never fun it's never fun no if he was no jokes there whatsoever so just try to cover up 
[01:51:00]  by dancing if he if he walked in and alice and i alan iverson was fucking his wife like that would  be fun right yeah like oh i'm fat and she's cheating on me with somebody who's in shape  or just the wife just getting slapped is not funny do you well we disagree with that  i think punched is funny you're right good point slapped isn't harsh enough no okay three  stooges slapped is funny okay sure that's that's iconic that's classic but what passes for funny 
[01:51:30]  in a lot of modern sitcoms is the wife simply turns and slaps the supposedly dumb husband yeah in the  back of the head or oh you and he's been scolded again he's such a dumb and if he's such a dumb ass  uh perennial 12 year old who's never going to get out of junior high school how is it his two kids  are geniuses right that is a routine and how and how did she marry him and why does she fuck him  like how dumb is she to open her legs from this fat lump who she obviously hates you know i've been  i've been watching japanese television which is all you know a lot of you know uh remember early 
[01:52:00]  heavy metal like in hit parader magazine and whatnot every single photo everybody looks like they're  being electrocuted you know and you go yeah yeah yeah wow i'll call it my dentist is rich photo  parts one through two hundred like this yeah that's japanese uh that's japanese acting that's  japanese commercials that's japanese comedy that's japanese angry that's japanese surprise and whatnot 
[01:52:30]  and uh it's fascinating to the degree where i had slingbox you know where we could watch american  television or what i didn't even bother i felt like i was transported to a whole nother planet there  who's got a good comedy show on american television today louis ck okay i'll buy you i'll buy that  louis jeffrey's got a great i haven't seen jim's show i hear it's very funny i have not seen it what's  the nature of jim's show jim it's basically his life basically like sort of like a louis ck 
[01:53:00]  it's called legit amy schumer's got a great show he's got a really funny show on comedy central  anthony jeselnik show is very funny on comedy central it's called jeselnik offensive it's basically  the tonight show with you know sort of a that kind of thing with really harsh jokes  and comedy central seems to be the pivot for most of this you know for two of the those two are  comedy central uh fx has jim jeffries and louis um i'm trying i'm sure there's a couple others i'm  forgetting too these new channels are racing huh what's what happened to regular television 
[01:53:30]  i haven't seen it eric's saying uh mark baron on ifc i heard it's a good show not maron's got a  show on ifc well i've heard mark on the what is it on the radio yeah he's got his podcast yeah  podcast and at the end at mark gets very serious now yeah at the end of his podcast i feel like i'm  being therapized i feel like you know i feel like he's gonna look at his watch and go well dave our  time's up see i'll see you on the next wednesday but he's he has become very philosophical yeah has 
[01:54:00]  become very um almost a little bit like a life coach or something yeah and isn't it interesting  that in terms of the internet which is the great all expansive now it's the whole future for the rest  of our lives at least in our in our time or whatever that the folks who have commandeered it  who are running the fucking show are the humorists and the stand-ups and the comics and the fellas  who do what you do for a living it's not the disc jockeys it's not the rock and rollers it's not 
[01:54:30]  the uh celebs the news faces the news teams that come from uh newsrooms or whatnot you might you might  have said oh it might be larry king or the bastard son of larry king it might be the bastard grandson  of a walter cronkite might be a roth you know who's used to being in front of large abuses no it's  the humorists it's the stand-ups it's the comics the comedians the players who have completely 
[01:55:00]  commandeered all of the best websites all the best blogs all the best broadcasting etc it's you  know one right after the other what do you think weigh in on this you know you're absolutely yeah  well think who's out there think who's actually you know doing this stuff it's yourself you got  rogan out there you know you got the list is long for podcasts jay moore you got jay moore then also  you got a bill maher who does the great you know he's just marcia run for office you know he's great  that's my one big disappointment about bill maher is how come you're not running for president 
[01:55:30]  he probably has too many he's probably fucked too many chicks without it you know i mean all these  girls that come out of the woodwork he's a comedian you can do whatever you want but once you start  running for office too many girls that come out and go and he fucked my ass and then my mouth  see that's what that's my theory why you never ran for office i couldn't run for office no way  we got a break real quick we have all right i'm at uncle vinnie's comedy club i'm running from office  tonight and tomorrow night uncle vinnie's comedy club in pointe pleasant new jersey we'll be right 
[01:56:00]  back uh with jim florentine david lee roth and then in a little while the great anderson silva  this is the opian anthony show  sirius xm and now the opian anthony show  what what what is the story with doing advertising on like website pod podcasts and whatnot are people  advertising oh yeah yeah that's how people make money is and they get a definite the advertisers 
[01:56:30]  love it even more than tv it seems because they know exactly how many clicks they get because  there's a counter there's no nielsen ratings there's no they know exactly how many people  have seen their product that's why i think when you look at a youtube channel and it says lady gaga's  video has 54 million views that's a lot of advertising money because every product says we know exactly how  many eyeballs have been on this and a lot of times you have to sit through at least five seconds or  sometimes the whole 30 second commercial but that's how they're making money off the internet 
[01:57:00]  and that's eventually what's going to drive the the internet is going to be all the advertising money  which is is it all the same products or is it no bunch of different ones bunch of different ones  some of it's for tv like again we talked about sabbath they did a brilliant campaign on youtube  almost every youtube video i watched a little uh banner for black sabbath 13 would come up regardless  of the video so they did a massive campaign on youtube and this was just any kind of video at  all or was it particular to that kind of music that well it was it was surprising there were videos 
[01:57:30]  that i thought were out of that demo and i can't remember any examples that had a 13 ad for them i  don't know if it was something like trent reznor something like nine inch nails might get the black  sabbath banner right yeah that one you'd expect but then there was other stuff i watched which were  just like whatever regular videos that were uh solena gomez yeah something weird or even a  non-music video something twisted speaking of something twisted did you see the movie spring  breakers i did not yes it's it's like teen porn right yeah it was that intentionally made to be so 
[01:58:00]  bad like showgirls did you see showgirls i went to the theater to see it okay and and it was so poor  that it was good right yeah andy warhol once said that if you do something intentionally so bad  that it'll turn out good yeah i'll give you an example van helen we tried to write the worst  punk rock song single no chorus no verse no nothing just two stupid chords try to play the 
[01:58:30]  stupidest solo possible and that's how we wrote ain't talking about love even the chorus is supposed  to be punk rock everybody at the time is yelling i'm in love with you i'm an ongoing i ain't talking  about love and i'm intentionally not singing just shouting it you follow me and tried to make the  worst possible song possible wow we were getting drunk in the basement and about halfway through  the evening i said uh-oh oh and it turned out really really you know positive like that so you 
[01:59:00]  know i gotta wonder you know if there's uh stuff that's you know so bad that it's good did you see  rock of ages yes i saw that okay way in here okay the movie the movie version why are you holding  your heart please share with us what did you see rock of ages was like i thought spring breakers was  definitely awesome like it was it was on that level of like it was just like what am i watching like  this is nothing and then it just became something you know what i mean well you spring breakers it's 
[01:59:30]  being pitched as kind of it's almost documented these are young people having fun on spring break  and it's kind of real kind of whatever and i'm so i'm watching movie guys you know create critics  even in japan sitting there rubbing the little chin hairs going it seems a bit like a dream yeah like  five little nectar butts in bikinis doing a federal court appearance in front of the judge and they're  all in their bikinis do you think it's a dream but it's almost like that was almost like a commentary 
[02:00:00]  on how awful that whole teenage girl thing that's happening is genre okay but what about rock of  ages what was that i did i did a whole podcast on how bad it is it was the worst movie i've ever seen  in the history of movie making why please weigh in here why please share with me just horrendous the  the story there was no storyline whatsoever it was all weak they were singing that the dialogue  was horrendous tom cruise actually was okay in the film everyone blamed it on him and it was just 
[02:00:30]  there was nothing redeeming about it whatsoever i haven't seen it but now i want to see it now i want  to see it even though it's a hunk of shit and not ironically good right i want to see it it has an  attractability to it now like bad horror movies where you see the uh spaceship hanging on the end of the  uh close line of the string and you feel smugly superior i tell people i said if you want to go  in if you have to go in watching this movie knowing and making fun of it because if you go in just to 
[02:01:00]  watch it go maybe it's not so bad you're going to be really angry after two hours you're going to hate  whoever recommended it you're going to yell at your wife if she wanted to sit with you it'll affect  your relationship it's that bad but if you go in mocking it you're going to love it well we're just  talking about like cringy comedy like the best comedy makes you cringe like you're watching this movie  and you cringe the entire time so if you're laughing at it the entire movie it's very enjoyable  exactly you feel smugly superior yes it's perfect like an ed wood movie yes you know where the effects 
[02:01:30]  are so piss poor and the acting is so bad that it becomes something that you look forward to especially  if you're watching it with other friends you dig and also you get that that element where  uh it becomes something familiar like a like an ugly face on a family member like rocky horror  picture show where everybody knows exactly what's coming right and i don't know was rocky horror good  or bad i can't tell anyone toast nobody throws toast exactly yeah you know and the songs are 
[02:02:00]  quote unquote so so bad but if you sing them all together well it's like campfire songs technically  those suck too but if everybody's having a great time it was the best dinner i ever had and it was  nothing but salami and and white bread but you were starving and you were with family and you were at  the beach and it was coney it's the community feel of it that makes it something a little bit more  like i love rocky horror sweet transvestite it's a great song and what's the other one uh when they 
[02:02:30]  get fucking uh damn it janet's very good uh so okay so you know what the music does stand up yeah  it's like the monkeys where it's fun to make fun of the monkeys until you actually sit down and go  these songs are pretty damn good and you you you probably you probably weren't even around when the  monkeys were happening and you can sing me monkeys on of course yeah i was watching the reruns when i was  a kid thinking it was like a new show yeah you can make fun of the monkeys all the way up until you  start listening and you go wait a minute those are real songs that's why you can still talk about 
[02:03:00]  the monkeys this many summers after 1965 and everybody goes yeah yeah and if you really want  to test my word on it say which one's your favorite monkey and somebody can always answer yeah well jim  let me tell you a quick scene in rock of ages and you tell me if there's any redeeming quality at all  catherine zeta jones plays like a pmrc tip of gore a woman rock and roll is infested to sunset strip and  it's all bad sure because you know that's that's devil music and it's sex and all that stuff so 
[02:03:30]  she's married to the governor or the mayor of los angeles and he's really cheating honorees and all  anyway so she gets a whole group of these these women he's like soccer moms they're across the  street from the roxy on the sunset strip with signs and they're singing uh we built this city and  then all the rockers are on the on the other side of the street going we're not gonna take it and then  they cut back we built this city we're not gonna take it i don't believe you that's so bad you don't 
[02:04:00]  believe me you you that's not something that was ever conceptualized or shut that's a lie no it's not  a lot no it's it's the music man it's where they split the screen in the four barbershop  it's got a light rose on one side you know you didn't like the rock and roll mashups oh that  sounds terrible and then it sounds so bad that it's almost intentional like showgirls where if 
[02:04:30]  you watch that carefully with a critic's eye it's so bad it has to have been intentional so that you  can say this is the worst like an ed wood movie if i said guys let's do an ed wood movie complete  with bad acting bad makeup bad effects come on jim we have to invent the flying saucers what's the  worst we can do paper plates mark get some paper plates fishing line it's a little thin do we have  any rope good good how about a shoestring better a dirty one nice yeah it's like when tarantino did 
[02:05:00]  grindhouse and he's he intentionally made it look bad and he fucked up the film and made  the film jump tarantino did that right yeah to give it the old movie house feel the acting was  purposely not good and yeah yeah i've accidentally done that in every project i've ever worked on  unintentionally been ed wood awful yeah but if you're doing it like showgirls i don't know  you have to look at the brilliance behind the people like when you look at the uk office 
[02:05:30]  gervais is a master in that because the jokes there's a genius to the jokes but they're they're  so uncomfortably awful his performance it makes you it literally makes my skin crawl and it's so  good it's a masterpiece his performance in the office but i he was brilliant and steven merchant's  brilliant so you know that like it came full circle and there were comic geniuses behind  this awkwardness right there comes a point it's almost like they went from 12 all the way around to 12  but somebody who's really just genuinely awful they go from 12 to 11 58 and they stop and in 
[02:06:00]  that little difference was what makes a great watchable thing and an absolutely terrible enraging  thing because for me one is acting and the other is just somebody actually being awful right yeah  acting you can watch infinitely it's like when one warhol did his brillo boxes they were just  different enough from the real brillo box right you know somebody tried to copy it got a bunch 
[02:06:30]  of brillo boxes put them up in the window they couldn't sell any of it it's just was that was  just a real deal you're doing an impression of it there you have to suspend your disbelief a little  bit there has to be some artistic license some other worldliness to it just a little bit  do you think the uh american production of the office is pretty good no i don't but again i acknowledge  it's a good show it's a good show well acted because it's so successful it doesn't do anything  for me um i watched a few of them it just reminded me of how the brilliance of the uk office so i get 
[02:07:00]  it i don't have to love it what's the worst job you ever had drove a forklift for sero copper um where  i had a boom attached to the front like a crane and i was unloading 20-foot copper bindles in january  off the back of flatbed trucks on a fucking ramp that was broken so i came off the wrong side of  the ramp i would have fallen off the dock on a forklift that's the worst job by far my worst my 
[02:07:30]  worst boss my worst job was my first job ernie robertson who ran a horse training stable over in  eaton canyon about two miles from where i was living in pasadena california and he said i'll give you your  first job he said but i have to start paying your minimum wage at the age of 13 says you got to go  get a social security card and you can't be 13 because i'm not going to pay you minimum wage it's  the first time i lied to the government you know i wrote my schwinn this was in like 1966 67 something 
[02:08:00]  like this i rode my bicycle over to the social security office in pasadena california it was a  much looser time you could actually walk a kid my age could walk in there and get the social security  card i told them i was 12 years old and uh instead of actually 13 so that i wouldn't have to receive  uh minimum wage for many many years up until about 10 years ago i thought i'd get thrown in prison when  the government found out i was actually uh telling people that i was a year younger than i actually was 
[02:08:30]  every now and then i get caught for it in the press and then they would say well if you're gonna lie  why why are you only lying by 10 months yeah what's the use at least chop half a decade here kid you  that is a funny thing to lie about 10 months  but uh ernie robertson didn't want to pay me a minimum wage i was shoveling shit at a stable 
[02:09:00]  there yeah that's a lousy job yeah but i did learn spanish you know everybody that i was working with  there you know was uh over the border uh surreptitiously it was spanish was the only thing  spoken everybody was working there for fifty dollars a week when not you know so now you  know i can bust a move pretty good and what is becoming the first language in the united states  quickly huh i was a telemarketer for two days and i quit because it was all these fat these fat women  sitting around you know doing a telemarket i was the only guy they hired and i was sitting between 
[02:09:30]  them and they were just sexually harassing me because they were like oh go get me some coffee  oh look at his ass oh he's hot and they were all weighed like 400 pounds and by the second day i was  so uncomfortable i walked out and left you couldn't take it i couldn't take it i mean yeah you know it  was it was like five 400 pounders just staring me down dressing undressing me and i was very  uncomfortable i bang chicks that big but it was just it wasn't the right moment you don't have to see  him every day yeah telemarketing what like a specific specific it was like those steaks those 
[02:10:00]  uh frozen um oh from omaha yeah omaha steaks that's what it was yeah what what what are the odds for  fat women are selling steaks there you go imagine hearing that voice selling you steaks hello are you  hungry oh yuck yeah but whenever i would say that all the fatties would look at me yeah yeah  that would ruin my i don't eat steak too much anymore but what about barbecues where's the  best barbecue in the city now i don't eat much barbecue do you got you don't eat barbecue there's 
[02:10:30]  a place where i like 20 like a vegetarian i eat meat i am saying this i haven't been to a place  specifically for barbecue like if i order chicken at home i'll get barbecue sauce and dip it but i haven't  gone to a place specifically for barbecue usually what i eat is horrible man it's like a crocodile diet  just birds and foliage so so when i splurge i like to go out you know you know there was a  barbecue place on like 21st or something there was a great it was called rub except first a car drove 
[02:11:00]  into it and destroyed the whole front of it so then they fixed it and then the hurricane came right  after they fixed it and blew it out again they didn't have any money to replace it so it's gone now  but that was the best place around here rub was the name it was yeah it's next to gotham comedy club  yeah oh i know where that is sure sure there's got to be another place though yeah there's a  there's a dozen you know barbecue places and barbecue is not always the same you know you got rub you  got mop you got dry rub you know there's a variety of different approaches here i watch a lot of food 
[02:11:30]  channel you know it was one of the few things in english in japan now do you are you a fancy food  god like will you go out to fancy restaurants in new york do you like a real gentleman's meal once in  a while or like i say i call it a crocodile diet it's crocodile diet is i eat uh chicken turkey oatmeal  and whatever greens and that's about it and that's breakfast lunch and dinner no bread hardly ever  sushi no sushi it's pretty rare breakfast is chicken burger uh oatmeal maybe some blueberries 
[02:12:00]  maybe a protein shake and most of the meals are pretty much the same kind of thing when i go out to  eat uh you know i like i'll splurge for what you consider most people consider standard like a  peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a mcdonald's the number two you know the two cheeseburgers with  the extra large fries and whatever for what you know is kind of standard for most people is like  happy holidays for me how often do you do that will you eat like really like a 
[02:12:30]  shit meal just to enjoy yourself about once a month okay yeah pizza uh yeah you bet all the all  the good stuff i was raised on all the good stuff are you kidding breakfast at the raw family you  know when i was a little kid was pancakes with extra syrup and extra butter and then the orange  juice came out of the frozen thing you know where you scoop the frozen in there but you put a lot less  water than you're supposed to so that the orange juice is sweeter and then you put a lot of sugar in  there as well you know and you might have a piece of toast with some butter and some sugar on it 
[02:13:00]  and uh you know grandpa ape died when he was uh it was during my mother's birthday party when he was  62 years old you imagine no matter mom's a little wiggy yeah you was you sang happy birthday and you're  singing killed grandpa yeah right you know and then caffeine huh caffeine oh yeah you know that's do you  eat anything before you work out in the morning we did not build this city on rock and roll we built 
[02:13:30]  it on caffeine do you work do you eat anything before you work out in the morning when i wake up  you know i do a protein shake it's vegetarian style you know kind of a rice based thing you know it's uh  it's real super sports specific you know because the the uh lighter and tighter that i stay then you'll  never lose that high note you know i make i make that joke about going to hear stairway to heaven 
[02:14:00]  and you know homeboy's not quite hitting that high note that's not uh a product of genetics it's not a  product of uh bad luck it's a product of breakfast and what you should or shouldn't be eaten in in  terms of do you really want that high note you want to preserve it you know you can go see tony bennett  and uh he's still got his high note and he's well up in his 80s there so it's just mechanics  it seems like your singing has gotten better over the years from back in the early 80s i've gotten a 
[02:14:30]  little more aware of you know how to fine tune my instrument when you first start off you know you  depend on your teenage metabolism to keep you skinny and preserve the high note i call it or the high kick  or anything in between and then if you're going to continue past the requisite three and a half summer  career careers these days are what three and a half years long if if that you know and if you  don't have a last name like a rihanna or a meyonce does lady gaga have a last name i guess gaga is 
[02:15:00]  kind of technically yeah exactly but those those kids go even faster you follow it just boom here today  gone later today and if you want to continue uh in the fight game long past you know into your 30s  and your 40s and whatnot then it's a matter of uh you know device it's a matter of plotting and  planning and scheming a little bit too much come on all work no play makes for you know that that's not 
[02:15:30]  real either we know actors who come out of for example los angeles here in new york they call it  la tight doesn't look real too much time in the gym too much perfect diet too much time in the suntan  booth too much time doing yoga ah yoga too much time uh vocal lessons too much time uh do you  follow what i'm saying absolutely it's overworked man you crushed it up too much it's all going to 
[02:16:00]  fall out the other end as perfection and nobody wants perfection a little flaw or a sign of humanity  or a sign of age or a sign of a voice crack i love one of my favorite things in the new sabbath record  is in this song damaged soul there's one parasi says soul soul and his voice cracks a little bit  and it's my favorite part of the fucking record is that moment your favorite jeans are not brand new  right they're the fucked up ones where the holes are in the exact right place and the fade happens  just exactly right here yeah exactly cowboy boots are not polished and perfect unless you speak spanish as 
[02:16:30]  a first language no no the texanos love that you know brand new blood red uh cowboy boots and a  brand new straw cowboy hat on friday night i'm down but friday that's not my first language i like  cowboy boots that show the distance look at these shoes those shoes tell a story these shoes have about  22 countries worth of passport stamps on them and so does the area right around my eyes 
[02:17:00]  here right so my smile lines are so deep it goes in one side and out the other it's not actually two  lines now wait does that do that you think it has anything to do with the way people are raised though  like people who are raised with a decent amount of money are comfortable kind of like faded or beat up  things are more comfortable and people who are raised without money or totally broke love the new  stuff because they didn't have it i'm wondering if that has anything to do with what people like too  yeah you perhaps you want what you don't got i i am increasingly aware of how hard we work once 
[02:17:30]  we're successful in our arts and entertainment in the united states how hard we work to look like we  don't have any money right you know who is get a smile that's true you go overboard to make  because you've never been you've never been a showy guy where you've you know known to live a lavish  lifestyle no for example elton john can't go anywhere without all of the lights on him all of the 
[02:18:00]  spotlight on him you know he starts with basic purple and goes to bright yellow and that's just  his glasses and i and i love that do you follow but uh i myself i i have a different balance to what i do  you know i like to kind of lurk around the edges a little bit as a matter of research i like watching  people i like you know like i said listening and finding you know the little bits and pieces that  i use in my art form are you friends at mick jagger i have been you know i've i've hung out and shared 
[02:18:30]  some strong drink with him before why what are you leading up to no reason i don't know him i just i  met him once i was like i was pretty starstruck i'm just wondering if you are friends with him  there's no reason for me asking i'm just curious what do you where do you put him as a front man  all time that's rock and roll and rock and roll that's interesting because in rock and roll there  was a whole lot of great new audience members who had never seen where he got it from you follow if 
[02:19:00]  you watch the uh what is it the t a and teenage america something show from the early 60s i think  it's 1965 james brown comes on right before the rolling stone and he does night train and you can  tell that he is competing all right this is when james had the famous giant conch haircut it was  called a conch and it took almost three hours to get his hair to do that that haircut was so cool it  had its own fucking area code okay and you know everybody imitated james brown you know doing the mashed 
[02:19:30]  potatoes and you know that i think it's called the holly golly etc you know that where you kind of move  your feet etc and he was competing with the rolling stones you could tell right away and he burnt that  stage down burn it down mick then comes out with the stones and it's a pale white boy version it's  just written all over the screen now admittedly he did get a whole lot better at that but just as if  you watch michael jackson and if you know the influences where it came from arguably the influences 
[02:20:00]  were a little bit stronger doing what they were doing you know watch some of what michael was doing on  that stage he's imitating some of the flash teams like the nicholas brothers or the berry brothers you  can google these you see these on youtube these guys come out of the 40s and the 50s and you'll see  the moonwalk you'll see you know the double backspin etc but it was done a little bit better you follow  and uh this is what i see when i see the stones is i i knew that i knew that giant totem pole when it 
[02:20:30]  was just a tree stump right and i'll always know i'll always think that to a degree just as when  people will watch van halen you know there's a lot of folks who think i'm completely original and then  there are those of you who know that no i stole most of my moves from james brown james brown  uh singing wise is probably closer to uh who sang mustang sally you know who's saying uh you know 
[02:21:00]  soul growlers you know closer closer to otis redding you know and uh sam and dave you know acts  like this so if you knew where if you knew the uh stone before it was made into the statue first you  never quite get that out of your mind you were the first one to jump off the drum riser though and do a  split i never saw that before okay well that's not called jumping off the drum riser and doing  a split that's called the 460 moonsault off the top rope i forgot it was your wrestling move and now 
[02:21:30]  dial in the color you go wait a minute it was the snooker fly drop wait a minute that was the sun  splash move wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute  no nothing new under the wrestling sun and that was always great with dave because it was always  a story and you never like you were saying before like you never denied it or said it was the truth 
[02:22:00]  uh one i think you were in a cast on the back of van halen too and they said it was from the picture  you took on the album cover from jumping off the drum rise yes that's true that is that is true and  there was another one where you broke your wrist and there was a story that you got in a fight with a  guy in a bar over rock versus disco and you and because he liked disco and you were a rocker  shit i don't i don't remember exactly that but i remember uh jumping off that drum riser  those are wrestling moves you know what and i was just on the radio uh on the radio i was just doing a 
[02:22:30]  podcast with stone cold steve austin the wrestler it was the other night and i was talking to him  and uh he's you know he says man dave he says i always wanted to be a rock and roller you know  he says most of these wrestlers wanted to be rock and rollers being a band of some kinds that's not  even a real coincidence because most rock and rollers see themselves as fierce warriors at some point  in our brief but colorful tenure either we're wrestlers or boxers or you know i personally am spider-man 
[02:23:00]  it's you know delicate house blend you know and uh i started appropriating from that early on when i  saw muhammad ali appropriating some of the persona i figured i could appropriate some of those moves  right now imitate spider-man in your imagination you crouch down and you get your fingers all apart  right like you're gonna get them with the palms of your hands right and you kind of make your eyes 
[02:23:30]  disappear you know well there's there's your new album cover shot you follow and uh then there's  the joker anytime i'm doing anything you know with the mic stand or a cane that looks remotely like a  cane like the top piece of the mic stand or whatever there's a way to kind of cock the head it's almost  like you're gonna tap dance but you never really do it's you guess kind of a menacing look to it you  never complete the move which is unsettling your phone right you look like you got a thought no no 
[02:24:00]  i'm missing no you know it's funny because um there's a bit i'm sure you know the band steel  panther i know of them sure the singer is you know they basically you know do 80s stuff or whatever  but it's a singer is totally i think he was in a van halen tribute band back in the day atomic punks  he was a singer buddy the the new uh generation of kids love this band they play like 80s hard rock  and he's total david lee roth on stage and he does every move wears the same outfits and people love 
[02:24:30]  it you know does the kicks does everything and it's just really cool to see and just a new generation  go wow that's real i've never seen that before if they didn't know van have didn't see van halen back  in the day well this solicits a whole nother conversation here let's start off with uh journey  the current uh arrangement of the band journey and we have our friend who is singing there  uh i think his name's arnell arnell yeah and arnell is making a living sounding exactly like somebody 
[02:25:00]  else okay um that being said it suggests it begs the question of are rock bands like a broadway play  like west side story where you can change the people over the years and the play remains every bit as good  if not better of course when you go see the modern broad game the modern uh version of uh west side  story on broadway today nobody is trying to sound exactly like the original cast i can't even remember 
[02:25:30]  who was in the original cast i don't even think i was alive for the original cast of that you follow  um but uh maybe rock bands are to some degree want to weigh in here what do you think is is what what  what's your answer to this question i i'm thinking i just got a text from chris jericho talking about  wrestlers and he's just saying this interview is the best he's probably calling in what do you mean 
[02:26:00]  we don't have a phone screener he was i think why don't we have a phone screen i don't know there's  been a phone screener all day but he was on the hotline okay he was out doing runs and then  i asked other people to come and nobody wants to come do who didn't want to come do the  fucking job that we need done well wait we'll just talk about wrestling instead of uh  arnel panetta because it's a more interesting well chris's got a great band chris got a great  metal band called fozzy yeah fozzy yeah is it is that a play on words yeah it's kind of like it was  it was originally but not but they're actually a really good band yeah because i just saw this 
[02:26:30]  coffee company last night on television jevalia company jevalia coffee company and i thought  it's a combination of the word vagina and genitalia right va gilia or whatever and if you just reverse  it jevalia no no you want to know why wrestling is the most popular thing going it's because it's  the only sport that everybody understands it's just like swearing is the only language that we all 
[02:27:00]  understand we touched on this subject earlier yeah yeah you know combat contact sports the rules are  the same there's a winner and a clearly defined loser is usually the guy laying on the back and  you can even understand the stories wherever you are you can figure out who the bad guy is who the  good guy is explain some of my roots now into this into the rock and roll think back to some of the  clothes i used to wear it's all wrestling stuff yeah right the knee pads and you and you wear it  just from the knee pads down to me it was comanche and and i don't know it's wrestling come on the 
[02:27:30]  with the pants with the side pieces it was black on the sides with the little stripes and it kind of  looks like ski pants is nothing but classic wrestling half of the moves were nothing but classic wrestling  the only thing i didn't do was land on land on somebody which occasionally would happen after the show  well that's not true dave because it was uh i never saw a wrestler wear assless chaps 
[02:28:00]  well actually you've seen something close to it because i got that from uh road warrior road  warrior part two okay remember uh the ayatollah of rock and roll and the guys with the big mohawks  etc all wore pants like that and i sat through that movie twice in a rainy monday night and passing  into california at the united artists theater when there were still movie theaters and i watched  that goddamn thing through twice and thought why isn't anybody doing this i get it american indian 
[02:28:30]  biker bondage thing this is so clearly evident what wrestlers did you like coming up um well you know  i imitated everybody you know if they had a colorful move you know um boba brazil you know the coconut oh  yeah it was very popular you know that's your first step moving away from the three stooges you  know uh jimmy snuka of course you know uh oh sure you know he was you know uh that was important for 
[02:29:00]  aerial tricks you know and then there were three or four different guys who were doing the moonsault  it's hard to pin that one on who invented that you know there's a japanese fella and a couple of other  fellas who were doing that also the idea of looking like terrifying bikers in the 1960s uh you had  movies where well there was always bruce stern played the bad guy okay and you had peter fonda  playing the good guy wild angels nancy sinatra was always the biker chick you know and this kind of a 
[02:29:30]  thing and what would happen is the bike gang would take over something either they storm a shopping  mall and take over the shopping mall or they'd storm a little town and take over the town or they'd  take over the bar and grill on the rex hall and they'd destroy everything and if they destroyed  the shopping mall area they'd wear everything that they stole and broke right so they'd wear christmas  decorations and women's feather boas and big stupid sunglasses from the costume department so they'd 
[02:30:00]  look psychotic fucked up and terrifying right and so so when i started seeing characters like hulk hogan  and then jesse ventura and stuff huge big muscular dudes with feather boas and psychotic glasses they  look like bikers to me you follow they look like the hell's angel movies of hey we got drunk and we  broke into this place and we found all these hanukkah decorations i'm a fucking rabbi  but did a van halen so so i would i would key into those elements you follow and then you know 
[02:30:30]  there's there were always it's it's it's hard to determine is it the fight or the theater is it the  actual showdown at the okay corral or is it the build-up the stagecraft we'll call it i don't know it's  that old thing of is it is it the peanut butter or the chocolate that makes it a reese peanut  butter did you borrow careful of your answer did you borrow anything on stage from bob backland 
[02:31:00]  he was boring back when jim loves bob back that doesn't sound like a name that  now he he was a champ for like three years and nobody even knew he had to cry baby and  walked on his knee walk was the big one that's a big one in rock and roll is the knee walk  is it yes it is certainly it's the knee walk what is the new well it's the legendary knee walk i  forget how he would do it i was a boy well he would start walking on his feet but then he would drop to 
[02:31:30]  his knees as he walks he'd come up and he'd go foot knee up that's right that's right it would  really show his athleticism short red hair sensible haircut yes they have that in japanese it's called knee  walking and you get ultra ultra low right and it's like you're on your tiptoes and your knees and so  forth yeah i think it's called tai show or something like pay show or something like it's called knee  walking yeah jimmy used to like bob backland doing that it's the way that you walk across the mat without 
[02:32:00]  being taller than the teacher especially if the teacher's already kneeling in place you can't have  your head above his head it's unforgiving training over there i just finished a year of that  shit and when you move across that mat you don't want your head to be above the teacher's even if  he's kneeling in place at the head of the class or you're going to end up sweeping up that whole  fucking place and cleaning out the bathroom so i guess the option would be to wait until the teacher  gets off the mat yeah or philly has to go to the bathroom and stands up yeah we gotta hey real quick 
[02:32:30]  i just wanted to ask you to um what did the band held the rest of the band ever go what the  fuck are you wearing when you would come in with us all right just costumes say that as we even speak  oh no the most recent conversation now it's done now it's done with a lot of laughter and a lot of  mutual surprise and support and a lot of mutual making fun of we understand the nature of sarcastic 
[02:33:00]  comedy we are not japanese you follow and uh they were discussing high top tennis shoes and uh they were  standing and you know the wives and some of the guys from the band were standing there some of the  gals from wardrobe and uh they were one of the gals was saying yeah i'm just a jeans and sneakers kind  of gal like just you know take it easy comfort or whatever and one of the wardrobe ladies says to me  what about you dave do you wear sneakers do you wear are you a sneakers kind of guy i said well just for me

[02:38:00]  and sam roberts and there's before anderson silver comes in he's not here yet there's a bit of  controversy brewing because we had a hotline ringing before yes and i don't know if it was chris jericho  if it was jay moore or colin quinn or any of these other people i i was trying to get mike  tyson to come in today because i figured what a surprise for anderson silva if mike walked in  although he you know they like each other you're fucking awesome it would be great it'd be amazing  but mike is in pennsylvania i think he's got to fight his two his fighters fighting mike is live  mike is livelier than ever he's the best i saw him doing the promotion like i started earlier 
[02:38:30]  started to say earlier and he had two kind of young fighters and he is from he's pushing them he's  going come on i want one of you to say you're going to kick the motherfucker's ass and and you  should be angry like you're going to kill the motherfucker he's like coaching them into guys  you got to get this uh get this colorful you got to pump up the volume of this he was the most lively  and dynamic uh character on the screen right then so i figured if he came in to surprise anderson  it would be nice but you never know he might i don't think that was him calling in but you just 
[02:39:00]  don't know so we had no hotline and eric is saying that fucking sal refused to do it so i told sal  outside i'm like that's unacceptable this is not this is a fucking not a hobby i'll refuse to do  what be out screaming calls but sal is angrily denying that and saying that's bullshit that's  not bullshit because i missed the hotline call yes but when i called him as i said i need you in here  to do phones i got i'm busy and he's yelling whatever and i said well i'm doing here's here's  what i when i went in there and told eric about the hotline he had already said sal said that he 
[02:39:30]  wouldn't come in at before so before this hotline even rang he said that sal had already said i'm  not going back there this is starting to sound a little bit like celebrity rehab it is yeah  they're building up a big wrestling match right here so sal what's the truth so this i'm sorry  no no problem go ahead so this is what happened uh eric calls me he says hey come do the phones  i said i'm in the middle of something he said okay he said come do them right now the show's more  important i said okay i'm sorry are you anderson's this is sound i have my glasses on so i said so i 
[02:40:00]  said okay hang up the phone i start walking back and intern tyler is walking back towards the  producer studio as well and he's walking back with breakfast and i said why do you have breakfast he  said oh this is eric's breakfast so which means that there was interval there was an interval of time  where there was no one at the phone where his arms tired i don't know okay which means that eric didn't  call me and say hey i sent intern tyler out for my own personal run my breakfast there was when eric 
[02:40:30]  eric never said that so eric sent him out with nobody i didn't have to fucking explain that to  you i said come do the phones and you scream i'm busy doing something we established that already  we're doing the live show and you're hung up this was established you didn't call me when you sent  him off of the phones to say hey come do the phones you sent me you called me when he was returning  already there hasn't been anybody on the phones all day that's bullshit too that we have been  screening those phone calls i've been watching him ring i'm in here in that last segment they 
[02:41:00]  were ringing yes all day we had people on and called and there was nobody and there was nobody  screening his call so eric failed to inform me saying hey i'm sending someone out taking them off  of that job that's being covered for you he never said hey come back here and do it so that's when uh  whoever was on the hotline called and eric we're not don't try to throw me under the bus i'm not  trying to throw you under the bus for the hotline i'm throwing you under the bus because when i said  i need you to come do the phone i came back i hung up and then i came back here dude i'm busy and then 
[02:41:30]  i said and then i said i'm busy i hung up the phone and i came back here dude lower your voice or i'm  going to suplex you you said eric i love a good yelling match okay does this sound like a van halen meeting  not even close it sounds like a meeting with management so so i said okay i said what i said but i hung  up the phone i started walking back here and then i saw tyler walking here you know you failed to  inform anyone anyone here that you took someone off of that position and sent them on a personal 
[02:42:00]  run it's your own fault don't try to throw me under the bus eric getting thrown under the bus is  colorful and eric you said that you had already asked him to come back and he had said no i hadn't  been on the phone today before the screen before the hotline called him i had called him for the  phones before sam you called me i never got a single call i have zero texts or calls from you  exactly thank you dave good point nobody cares we like to know when the machine breaks down what  happens because there's a lot of stuff that goes on and we might have missed a good call for you 
[02:42:30]  you don't need to discuss the ingredients in front of the uh in front of the client pal i'll tell you  one thing the audience has had enough cake they want to know how it's fucking made and the audience  has had enough shitty cake and they want to know why the cake is terrible so we're trying to tell  them i thought this icing was supposed to be sweet exactly this icing tastes like shit what  happened well but the salad was supposed to get the sweetener and fucking eric uh sent somebody  out to get something so there's no sweetener whose fault is this sam to wrap this up i believe i gotta  say i gotta side with sal on this one it doesn't sound like sal got the call until after the hotline 
[02:43:00]  which means eric was looking at an empty chair and not doing anything let's cut to the crash who do we  think was on the phone who might that have been i believe it was jericho okay so let's put words in  his mouth and what would he have said had he had gotten through on the phone yeah this is a great  interview um i really do i enjoyed van hanel a lot of times you know our band we've been doing great  but you guys were a big influence on us and uh jimmy great job even better than uh with opie and anthony  those guys are giant albatrosses around your neck and you should be making all the money and i'm really 
[02:43:30]  enjoying the show any price at all you name it kid you name your price yeah that sounds like jericho  that sounds a lot like jericho yeah he's like and by the way i have my show on six cents every uh  whatever it is because he has a radio show he certainly does he's a big metal guy and he probably  would have said i'm looking forward to american degenerate tonight and then i'm going to go uh  ask you anything on reddit i'm going to ask you something on reddit i'm going to go to davidley  roth.com and i'm going to see jim florentine and my cousin at my uncle vinnie's and 
[02:44:00]  now we would have given him a pitch for his record what's the name of his record it's not  it's coming out in a couple in a few weeks and he's not the title what is that i'm not sure  what the title is and he's torn with saxon okay but it's a for real record it's a for real record  it's like what is the name of the band if fozzy and it's about their fourth or fifth records coming  out why is it called fozzy that was i think a play on ozzy or something else and uh he's been doing it  for many many years since i first started coming on op i think like 2000 and his he had a character  name i think was moongoose mcquade was like a funny character he was doing and he wouldn't break 
[02:44:30]  character that is a good name but then it became this thing where the band was good and people like  them and uh oh yeah you know what i mean it's almost like it's like the movie the producers we  got to create a flop there you go and then we will make a million bucks in the uh overages of the taxes  that don't get oh no it's a success yeah yeah and they do springtime for hitler and lo and behold it's  a smash hit and it's yeah that that's a catastrophe that's yeah exactly so but now for chris is good 
[02:45:00]  though because he probably doesn't want to wrestle as much as he used to i mean no how long is he's  been wrestling for a while long time yeah he looks way younger than uh than you the kinds of distance  that wrestling puts on you you know that's high impact and uh but he's been doing it since the 80s  as well yeah yeah early 90s early 90s yeah but he's been smart enough like as he got later in his  career once he established himself to take time off so he'd go away for a year or two he'd tour 
[02:45:30]  with the band for a while and that's what he's doing now he'll wrestle for like six months and  then he'll go tour with the band for six months then he'll come back to wrestling for six months  that happens with rock bands all the time you get guys who are constantly constantly around and  around and around after a while they can't sell tickets and it's completely uh overly familiar  whatever we in van hill we're on the james bond uh schedule i call it every three and a half years  the new james bond movie comes out any sooner and the first thing you hear is weren't you guys just 
[02:46:00]  here right that's the worst you never want to show up at a party in the apartment and have somebody go  weren't you just here yeah yeah you want that little bit but as my grandmother said when my first  girlfriend moved away distance makes the heart grow fonder yeah she did say that and the relationship  lasted six times as long as you were never at home that's no i have not seen the girl since and that  was fifth grade if i keep going back to the same porno is it is that a relationship technically yeah but 
[02:46:30]  it's not just with the women it's with the guys in it too it's you're involved with all of them if you  keep going back to the same one now but do you rewind it to the beginning or you keep it right at that  spot well i ran into a serious issue with that with conditioning i'm a very eminently conditionable  guy and in the late 80s i ran into a problem to where i was rewinding and pretty soon i couldn't  get off unless i was with two chicks who pretended like they were moving really fast backwards 
[02:47:00]  which is i'm not kidding i know you're not believe me we know you're not that's the beauty of  it no one thinks you're kidding you can't rewind porno it's never as good david in a threesome  though a lot you know there's a lot of it you got to give attention to everybody because someone  you don't want to feel someone doesn't want to feel left out one of the girls which is inevitable  so how do you how do you work that how do you how do you placate them where they can both have a  good time and not worry that you're spending too much time with one and all they got to know each 
[02:47:30]  other in advance if you really want to know the truth the mechanics of this they got to know  each other in advance and it has to be their idea because if you're going to be the mechanic if  you're going to be the master cylinder and you're going to bolt that shit together it's usually glued  together with jack daniels and a lot of and a lot of bullshit promises that you that you can't keep  because it's four in the morning and and and but it's got to be their idea so it was better like 
[02:48:00]  after a show you wouldn't just pick two random ones you know two girls that were hanging out  backstage just didn't know each other that usually ended in a disaster yeah two friends worked way  better oh absolutely and do you have to witch doctor it into their head so like it's your idea  but it they think it's their idea no no no they'll know in advance they've already figured it out they  got the logistics you know and uh that that is a standard okay um if you think you're going to put it  together okay you talk about mechanicing and like okay what's one of the tricks oh i know you'll leave 
[02:48:30]  some of the penthouse magazines laying around and she just all guys all of us think we invented that  shit and she picks it up and goes oh do you like this stuff and you act surprised and go why do you  like you're the first one to invent that nonsense did it work for you we used to leave the playboy  channel on and take the and hide the remote and take the knob off the tv before we went to the club 
[02:49:00]  so we got girls back that was on the tv and we're like i don't know where the remote is do you know  i don't know you don't even have the pliers to turn the channel i guess we got to watch this  exactly take the knobs off yeah we took the knob off so they couldn't even just do it manually like  i don't even know where the knob went that's so funny no it's gotta be it's gotta be their idea because  you're going to be uh you're going to be fascinated with one gal more than any of the more than the  other you know you have a choice of whatever so you're always going to favor one i do remember 
[02:49:30]  one and once these two gals approached me in vancouver i guess after a certain point of time all is  forgiven right right yeah i can get away with pretty much you know whatever and these two gals approached  me uh dancers italian girls those weren't italian dances but i'm sure that's dances would be popular  if they did them in italy and uh it was a at a strip club called the cecil hotel in vancouver and they 
[02:50:00]  approached me at about two in the morning and said hey we're upstairs in a room upstairs and um they  both had huge wads of dollar bills like you know six inches stacks of it great looking gals  and it was stuffed in their g-strings um i'm going to cut to the crash because i'm not sure who's  really listening to this show at this point in time but when i woke up the g-strings had burst and 
[02:50:30]  there were dollar bills everywhere and it was like somebody had tarred and papered us because it was in  the middle of the summer like july or august really hot and sweaty and the dollar bills were like glued all  over us and i remember thinking to myself i am made of money  if but for a moment  do you ever like your like your comedy there's no punchline no no there was more but now when you 
[02:51:00]  have two and the two girls leave do you ask for both numbers how do you do that just out of courtesy  even though you're not going to call them oh i can make taxi fare in 17 languages are you kidding  like like like uncle manny said hey kid the secret to show business is sincerity when you can fake that  you're in  golly look at the time no i've always i'm not even i'm hesitant to even say the word groupies because i 
[02:51:30]  always got along great with the gals that i was chasing out on the road and the girls that we were  chasing in a groupie frame of mind did not look anything like groupies that you're thinking of  usually when you say groupies you're thinking of some a variation of motley crew meets uh cc the  bill from poison times teased hair with vampire goth makeup and there is a place for that kind of a girl  but wednesdays 
[02:52:00]  not weekends not weekends  and uh we were chasing the prom queen we were chasing the homecoming girl we were chasing  the uh the gymnastic oh yeah you know we would we would go uh checking out the line i would take my  bicycle out of bicycle not motorbike but bicycle out of the back of the tour bus and go cruise the lines  of everybody who was waiting to get into animal seating shows when there were no chairs you know so 
[02:52:30]  there'd be huge long lines six blocks long you know and we would just cruise up and down there  and i still keep up with a number of those gals too some of them are on their second husband  with the whole fucking line be going crazy seeing you ride the bike no true revolutionary moves  invisible and building and vulnerable uh amongst the people you know as you can see i can either dress  up you follow and attract the attention or you dress the same color as the buildings get just kind  to fit right in with the surroundings and whatnot and uh you get the best of both worlds that way 
[02:53:00]  you go around completely unnoticed until it's time to get a decent table at the restaurant so basically  so basically you did a dry run oh yeah and uh you would uh jesus what else did we do this was when video  was you you took four guys just to carry the equipment today you need just a cell phone  or whatever we used to have to lug that fucking camera with all the cords there was a special box  for the cords and then the recording unit you follow and then we had a trunk full of costumes you know 
[02:53:30]  like a wedding dress you want me to keep going yeah of course so you would dress them up you i  like costumes for sure a state trooper outfit you know yeah we were full production you know it's  me and hailing man six times the size 20 times as fast you know some people take a some people burn  their candle at both ends and in this band we took a blow torch to our candle 22 times the light and one-third the time 
[02:54:00]  yeah here's my new junior miss flamethrower  hey where's the candle you're breathing it did you ever like a girl and go like wow she's kind  of cool i want to see her and then you realize that she was banging somebody else in the band too  like right after you like in all the years it didn't happen in the band but then i would catch her  with the opening act oh no yeah oh no well that's what they mean by the circle of life right 
[02:54:30]  right yeah that's that was a routine we would always chase the gals who were you know uh chasing  the band that we were opening for jesus in vietnam we opened for everybody sabbath we opened for  journey we opened for boston we open kiss doobie brothers for kiss stones you name it we open for  everybody and uh you know it was a wild time you know late 70s early 80s etc so that's part of the fun 
[02:55:00]  too you know you're going to conquer the world if you're going to conquer the entire world well  you start with one girl at a time would you ever meet a girl and you liked her so much you'd keep  her on the bus you know for the next to the next city oh certainly a thing of beauty yeah not last  forever but at least a three-day weekend then how do you tell her it's time to go how do you get rid of  her yeah you met her in boston and now you guys are in louisiana now how does she how do you tell 
[02:55:30]  our luck you got to go back to boston oh well you use security for that you know we again it was a  crazier wilder time is we would rent extra hotel rooms just for the fourth encore we would call it  you follow and you and just before you go into you know uh for your extra encore in one of the hotel  rooms you tell one of the security guys give me a call in 20 minutes in 20 minutes the phone phone  rings and you act all upset you go no way no way shit shit i gotta go you know and uh make it down 
[02:56:00]  the hallway probably to another room what if you didn't finish in 20 minutes oh you were finished  that that was never a uh that was never you know speed trials were never  a big hurdle with this bad so you'd have another room just to get out of there like  do you go sleep like would you keep your your stuff in the fucking in the in the dummy room kind of or 
[02:56:30]  in the in the other room my personal best was i had my room i had one of the security guys's room  and one of the encore rooms all going in one night  and you'd go from one to one yes i was in room one then i went to room two then i went to room  three and then back to room one and and this and you know that's impressive yeah i know that's  i'm saying that's impressive that's pre viagra no drugs cialis no drug free so he was almost like  a baseball player in the 70s he didn't take the peds or the steroids we didn't have any of that or i 
[02:57:00]  would have have you taken it since sialis stuff viagra i take it oh i've tried it you know you  like it you know i got it mixed up with my heart meds one point and i thought wow this stuff really  is improving my circulation well isn't that how it came to be is it was for viagra yeah it's it was  supposed to be preventative for heart attacks i'm lucky that we didn't have that stuff are you 
[02:57:30]  kidding if we had steroids and uh you know and all the you know the stay hard pills whatever the  cialis and everything like that i would have killed myself years and years you would have  rented out six rooms years and years ago they would i would have died you would have had to  have beaten my dick to death with a baseball bat it would have been so full of calories  yeah it's it's funny i take it now and a lot of times i don't have anything to do  no girl but i'm just sitting there just take it what like the daily medication like it's your 
[02:58:00]  vitamin let's just say you get your uh you get your hopes up for no reason and then you're just  jerking off really impressively like a boy scout always be prepared yeah but there's nothing worse  than when you're prepared and no one shows up and you're like well you can't get unprepared once  you're prepared so uh sometimes i'll just put on my spandex pants alone i've done that i put on my spandex  shorts and take pictures of it in the mirror do you send it to anyone yeah are you sending dick 
[02:58:30]  pics to people the question is when am i not yes always always okay this is this is more prevalent  and way more popular than i ever thought it would be somebody had mentioned that people were doing  that when i first moved back into new york city i don't know 10 years ago or whatever and then anthony  wiener shows up and now you know word bounces i think we have some special guests here we certainly  do i think we got real good we could bring anderson uh he's way more interesting than anthony wiener

[03:00:30]  jiu-jitsu jiu-jitsu is the number one eh yeah when did you start that oh  start when you're a kid time for yeah yeah and and have you always known about mixed martial arts  yeah it's always familiar because there was a time when that did not exist  in united states how long has mixed martial arts been it's been here for a while but it became popular 
[03:01:00]  i think with uh with hoist gracie after uh in the ultimate fighting is when when we in the u.s kind of  became aware of it was watching this small gracie beat up 300 pound guys and and tap out 300  pound guys but when the legend are you know the gracies yeah was that what attracted you to it was  the fact that a a a smaller guy could could beat somebody of a greater physical strength or what brought  you to mixed martial arts um what did you say what what made you go to like uh from um muay thai to 
[03:01:30]  mixed martial arts oh because uh um i training hard and i watching the fight the roy uh uh the uh  he's uh um hoist hoist gracie and my friends training jujitsu and talk to me hey look this is roy's grace  fight it's it's good this is the ultimate fight but i training is normal one day my my my teacher 
[03:02:00]  talked to me hey you ready for the mma fight no this is danger i know training mma but i train i i i  i started the training the jujitsu the novano in kuritiba and were you scared of it when you first started  it because you thought it was dangerous yeah and my first fight in the uh the city is the 
[03:02:30]  kuya ba corumba in brazil now we're at a point now with anderson and for those of you that follow  ufc you are you're for the first time in a long time you're the ex champion of of the middleweight  division and uh it was i was at the fight and it was it was a very shocking thing to see um what  what did you feel when you woke up on the canvas because for you that's not something that happens 
[03:03:00]  very often uh not too much is the it's normal fight is fight in you have the the moment magic and you  have the chance for no no come out you you open it and you open it not come out you but it's normal i  back the december for the next for the rematch yeah and it's the 28th to promote the rematch ufc 168 is 
[03:03:30]  saturday uh december 28th that's of course uh chris weidman who's now the champion uh verse anderson and i  i think that's in vegas yeah vegas it is in vegas and at first you said no rematch the first thing you  said was you didn't want to fight chris again what changed uh the first the first time i i signed the  uh the the new contract dana talked to me you fight uh uh for chris weidman you win or chris win you have 
[03:04:00]  the rematch all right all right but the first time they finished the fighting in the the my fight the  chris white one i'm tired and uh no no too much happy and talked oh i know more fight for the belt  but i fight but no more for the belt but dana talked to me hey what happened this is normal let's go 
[03:04:30]  do you feel you because you're you know do you feel you lost giving it your best fight because it was  you were taunting him do you feel like you lost giving it your best or do you feel like  like you didn't want to lose that way uh  i train hard for for win all the time but sometimes you don't have too much chance for for uh uh for win 
[03:05:00]  the chris weidman uh is the the very very very strategy and uh you focus straight and  let's see it sometimes sometimes the you have the good working sometimes bad working  well no you train hard for the fight you were in shape to fight you were ready to fight 
[03:05:30]  but i mean in the moment like in that moment when he tagged you and and you went down  were were you were you in a moment like you wish you could take that back and have been fighting  harder because it didn't feel like you were giving your ability in that moment it felt like you know  because you're such a great fighter that he caught you kind of in in a moment where you shouldn't have  been in that moment did that make any sense yeah yeah um i i don't remember too much because for me is the 
[03:06:00]  is the finish is the i have the next story now is the december 10 rate i have the new story for  anderson uh sometimes you have good good good night in the fight sometimes bad night the fight but i'm  happy because i'm complete fight now i'm complete attack now because uh this is the new experience for 
[03:06:30]  me is knock knock them out it's a new experience for you does it feel odd or or different to be hungry  again to get the belt back because it's you you you had the most uh title defenses i think in in a row  is it hard to stay hungry we talked about that before staying hungry is it hard to stay hungry  your 10th defense as it was your first defense yeah uh i'm i'm very excited because i have the chance 
[03:07:00]  i have the new chance for for change my my my story one more time is uh the fight for the first fight for  chris whiteman is very important for my legacy is the second fight is the more and more important because  and uh december is the new anderson's coming because i'm more complete i'm ready for for the the new 
[03:07:30]  fight because i'm more complete now because you're you're occasionally you're it's interesting to watch  you because you can you can strike at will you you you you throw so fast and you kick so fast and then  sometimes you you you put your hands down and you hit your chest and you you taunt the other guy  is that part of your your fight game is is to get into their head and frustrate them and get them to 
[03:08:00]  make my game this is the for me it's normal i know no no no putting this because uh don't don't respect  my opponents i respect my opponents but this is my strategy it's it's it's your stress it's not a  lack of respect for the opponent it's a part of getting him to make a mistake because he's so pissed  off at you yes and it does work yeah in the united times working yeah other times in the united states 
[03:08:30]  what we celebrate the most is when an athlete wins then he loses and he gets it back  that's why muhammad ali is yeah so popular three times lost it got it back just like real life my life  is happy then it's then it's great then it's then it's lunchtime yeah this is normal win 
[03:09:00]  lose win lose we we love to see that and you will not be considered a super fighter until you have  lost and won it back because yeah it's more yeah it's normal do you agree with this normal this is  the the the real this is your opportunity yeah because i'm normal guy i'm no superhero i'm normal  guy sometimes win sometimes no win sometimes you go for the normal life you go for the working you 
[03:09:30]  working your job no no good sometimes good this is normal in the in the first round was there a  moment it looked like chris got you down and was going i think was it for a heel hook he was trying  to get on yeah were you worried in that first round because he he's a very good wrestler and people said  that he was going to try to get you on the ground and tap you and in that first round i'm like oh he's  got he's got he's got i'm black belt jiu-jitsu so yeah i'm black man i'm so you're not worried about 
[03:10:00]  his wrestling yeah the crease is good wrestling and the good jiu-jitsu training is good jiu-jitsu for uh  the gracie academy but i train hard i train in wrestling in my academy and i train jiu-jitsu for  nogera brothers and ramon lemus the atos jiu-jitsu i'm i'm very very happy for chris giving me the 
[03:10:30]  chance for for for the new fight um do you have a strength coach do you have a special coach for  strength training yes diet yeah explain to us what do you have what do you have the rogerio camões is the  uh my coach for for 10 years is that my bottle my my body training and uh my cardio and does he  help with the food too yes what did you what did you have for breakfast today oh and today is day off 
[03:11:00]  i i i i i talked to my friends now hey come on it's normal breakfast american breakfast please  the guys talk to me hey you i need just take your focus because in 10 more years you stand back for  training all right okay what's an american breakfast though that's a good question what's a what's a good  breakfast like a fun breakfast on a day off orange juice the eggs and bacon and fruits i love it how 
[03:11:30]  about a regular training day breakfast oh um no too much is the eggs and little fruits  and protein that's it no no no bacon nothing no sugar no orange juice um so you have you really  started training for this next fight now or do you start in 10 days back yeah how long before a fight 
[03:12:00]  do you start how many weeks before a fight oh three four four weeks month a month yeah about a month  before is when you really get serious and then what do you go up until like the week of yep this is going  to be this is probably going to be the the biggest fight in ufc history before this was the second fight  with anderson and chael sonnen which the first fight was very tough for you you had an injury 
[03:12:30]  and uh you you tapped chael in round uh five uh and and then the second fight second round win this is  i think the biggest fight in ufc history is this rematch between you and chris weidman uh i want to  see this more than i want to see silva jones and that's a fight i really want to see is you john jones  and john jones was very upset when you lost that fight believe me one day one day maybe but you  want to get through this one yeah i take my fox now for for for my rematch and i finish my rematch i 
[03:13:00]  talk to dana for for the the future ufc how much do you walk what weight do you walk around that because  you're 185 when you fight but you can you know 205 is light heavyweight what weight do you walk around  it um 188 189 oh you walk around at fighting weight yeah sometimes uh 205 okay i walk around  at about probably 145 i'm trying to get down to 130 your way around the fight game man you're pretty 
[03:13:30]  well up on all of this it's from just watching these guys you know what i mean because i i do a little ab  work um you know nothing like these guys do a little bit of cardio do you do interval training i just  started doing interval training well that's the response that deserved he laughed at me one long  interval between the training sessions yeah yeah why don't you ask him if he does hot yoga while you're  at it i've tried hot yoga i know you have i know you have i couldn't do it yoga's good yeah can you do  hot yoga like the uh i can't do it like yeah i talked to mom to my wife hey you need to practice yoga 
[03:14:00]  for relax please oh you get your wife to do it yeah so you do it or you don't no  all right he's basically saying that well we used to call it stretching and warming up now it's  called yoga and pilates you know but how far do you run because i can't go very far yeah sometimes  i don't like to run no i don't need it sucks yeah it's too much so what so what do you do for cardio 
[03:14:30]  uh uh i training uh the the specific training and uh the regular training and academy i go for the  pool oh the pool yeah but running i know running too much because uh sometimes uh is different you  know for training i i prefer the the real training for for mma and uh so you fight basically just fight 
[03:15:00]  every day yeah that's what your training is is you fight you don't like a whole lot of the of the  jogging or you don't like yoga or any of the out ballet or any of the other stuff but there are guys  that have said they took ballet who are in the fight game what boxers have taken ballet because  they said it helps with the with the foot movement yeah i trained in ballet for the for a long time oh  you did yeah my mom put me in in ballet but for a long time ago and did that help with the kids yeah with 
[03:15:30]  your foot movement yeah now you seem to really like kicking people um i was watching your face  when it was in the it was in the weidman fight in in round two and your arms were down and you were  throwing just very angry like really precise uh leg kicks and it seems like you like to do that to  almost punish somebody when you're not even trying to knock them out it seemed like there was something  you just enjoy being able to kick somebody at will yeah i train hard my kicks you train to make your 
[03:16:00]  kicks yeah yeah this is normal is the the part the technique the muay thai technique and i train hard  are your shins tough because don't muay thai guys kick uh tree is that a rumor like they say that the  shins of a of a muay thai fighter they kick like tree bark and they kick wood to make their shins is  that true or is that bullshit no this is not real oh it's not real no so how do you toughen up your  shins and get scar tissue on your shin it's the uh the normal pad you kick the pad you're training 
[03:16:30]  to protect and that you you leg but this is not real oh okay i'm just watching too many movies  jim have you ever done martial arts have you ever taken a class or have you ever done boxing or anything  like that i hit the heavy bag by myself uh but it makes my knuckles sore so i stopped doing that  because i have very delicate hands and it would really bother me so me too you do really yeah  i'm joking oh okay okay i'm like no you'd be good at it man you're feisty you got the energy for this 
[03:17:00]  now my cardio is not good though i can't do good cardio like i do the i do the elliptical machine  for and you could try this it helps a little bit i do 30 seconds really hard and then 30 seconds  relax 30 seconds really hard and then 30 seconds relax and i do that for about three minutes yeah  the sports is very important your practice sports is very important this is very important for your  family for your kids the sports is very good do you play golf a lot of hardcore athletes play no i 
[03:17:30]  don't play golf because uh i don't have too much technique for for play what do you do what  what other sports do you play to relax because there's always something guys do i love paintball  paintball yeah i love it i love and sometimes i play the football do you mean soccer or american  soccer okay are you good at paintball yeah i love it i played it one time and i got those things hurt 
[03:18:00]  when you get hit outside the pad with a paintball yeah i mean maybe they don't hurt you but they were  very uncomfortable for me i didn't care for paint well you can adjust the pressure on the gun man you can  turn it up to 350 pounds and it'll leave a bruise and you know it'll convince you to learn faster yeah  i didn't know that i thought i was gonna be really good at it but i i really sucked at paintball so uh  now uh you do a whole bunch of promotion today and then where do you train you gonna train in l.a  or brazil oh i go for thailand and in ten days thailand yeah i go for the for for training in my 
[03:18:30]  my academy and then my grandmaster in thailand how long will you be in thailand oh maybe  one month i need to talk to my team and my my master is it hard jim you should tell anderson about  your trip to brazil well i i went to rio oh it was good cd yeah i went three times and i um i went to uh  uh i was i stayed on uh in cobra cabana oh good and uh yeah i went to a club called help you ever see 
[03:19:00]  the club uh help um jim you should come to thailand with me and i'll show you some clubs yeah well that's  i i there was a lot of very beautiful girls yeah a lot of very beautiful girls and um i i think i i had to  go get penicillin uh before i left i think i might have gotten a little bit of a cold or something 
[03:19:30]  while i was there really i know her i enjoyed it very much venereal denise yeah yeah i've never been  to thailand though uh you know sounds like you're just right yeah i think so but you don't get into  you know you're a you're a family guy and you know yeah yeah was that let me ask you because i  remember after the chael sonnet fight your kids were came out with you on the and it was very 
[03:20:00]  emotional for you it seemed like my kids my son and my nephew go for the the the fight it seemed like  that second win over chael meant a lot to you and and you seemed more emotional than i had seen you  because he had been taunting you all the way up and that fight was really important does this fight feel  like the same kind of urgency that you felt in that fighting because you really wanted to beat chael sonnet  and you did and yeah this is i training hard for the the the fight for for um 
[03:20:30]  weibin chael and it's the great fight for the story and uh for me is the great moment my sons is coming to  you giving the congratulations inside your octagon and this is good because ufc is the  known for for sports for the specific people is the all the people for kids for family it's good i'm 
[03:21:00]  very happy well a lot of people call you the greatest mixed martial artist of all time i mean uh  uh you're certainly the most uh prolific uh title defender in the ufc and i was really bummed that you  lost and i hope that you win this next fight i'm a big fan and um it's saturday december the 28th  it's ufc 168 it is uh weidman who's now the champion and you're fighting to get your your belt back 
[03:21:30]  and i guess we're going to see a your a bit more intensity in this i hope than than the first because  you look prepared in the first one just not at that one yeah moment yeah but uh chris whiteman is the  new champion the people i need to respect to you but this is a sport is normal is the uh the rematch  but i respect chris i i training hard for for this fight and i need to say uh thank you chris whiteman

[03:23:00]  we have returned and we're going to wrap up the show we're going to do three out of five falls  you're going to tap out norton you're going to tap i just i usually get them to do something to  me but he's already kicked me i always get them to do a move or whatever yeah but he kicked me the  last time he was in and uh it hurts i like to take a good kick or something a good kick or a good  whatever punch or something well to say that you got punched by so-and-so or that yeah whatever and 
[03:23:30]  he didn't want to hurt me but uh the third one he did kind of you felt it you kicked you yeah  yeah but he did it really gently but it gave me a headache for two hours because it jostled me  he kicked me in the arm and uh my head hurt for two hours because the the jostle i was like that  i probably shouldn't do that again that's why i didn't do it again well this is his big opportunity  you know like i said america we love it when you embrace victory and defeat and then you come back  yeah and get it again you know all the all the best movies are like that no no football movie is 
[03:24:00]  about they got together they won they won they won again then they all got married and their kids  won right yeah yeah no it's about you know they won and they lost but then it rained but then the  coach was an alcoholic and then there's a quarterback i arrested and you know it's ups and downs that's  what made ali you know yeah yeah you know so uh dynamic is do you know he won it and lost it and 
[03:24:30]  won it and lost it you know watching that development so this is his big opportunity  actually yeah september 28th and uh i mean december 20th i'm really looking forward to this fight a lot  i look forward to usc events the way i should look forward to banging girls but i just don't care  anymore i'm like i could just pay for it so this is what i get excited about you sound like you know  a lot about it too man you clearly know a lot about the fight game yeah just from watching it and  from listen joe rogan is such an amazing and he's the best announcer in sports is fucking rogan so just  from watching it and hearing the points that he's made you know you kind of pick up on it just 
[03:25:00]  watching but i can't i wish i knew it from doing it like you know i mean say i can talk about music  a little bit but i can't do it it's the same thing with fighting so how come you don't go do it there's  a million good teachers around particularly on the east coast here and so forth i'm lucky i can get  myself into the gym to work out like i've been going a lot for the last year going to the gym to work  out is yeah you're gonna sit you're gonna look at yourself in the mirror and then you go into the  gym's no fun unless you got some dame in a leotard doing side hack pulley lunge squats or something 
[03:25:30]  you know he's got to cure his sexual sex addiction first before he gets into fighting yeah that takes  up a lot of his time if he becomes a fearsome warrior then you know then uh it makes it more  attractive to uh the first time i tried to fight somebody though i know something would go drastically  wrong and i would get my jaw broken or yeah i just i don't need it it's not fighting it's not that  you're going to get on the mat start slugging it out to see who wins on points it's that like you  say you learn the mechanism of it and you can start to find your way you don't start surfing 40-foot 
[03:26:00]  waves you start on the little baby waves on the styrofoam board you know and you learn your arm bar  and learn a few basics it'll make it a lot more interesting for you to look at if you understand  some of the language have you ever put in one of those moves that are fucking painful oh sure man i  trained i trained uh brazilian jiu-jitsu for a while here in town at hoist gracie's place oh  see oh you know i've been doing the marshal i've dabbled in everything i've done a little bit of 
[03:26:30]  everything you know and uh not even so much to learn all the other styles so as much as if whatever it  is you know i've seen it at least once before right but uh way more and way more fascinating than going  for me to the gym you know lifting weights is great for me for uh rehab when i gotta fix something  when my shoulder goes or i got a lower back issue or something you know coming out of a surgery or  something nothing beats the gym lifting this and the weights etc like that and given no other option  sure i'll i'll hit the weight stack but i'd much rather go to a martial arts class or one of my kendo 
[03:27:00]  classes or something like that and actually do something while i'm quote unquote working out the idea of  going and working out that sounds a lot like homework and you know how i feel about that  yeah no that's understandable but you're also a guy who's been in shape for many years like you know  you you've been in martial arts shape for first for you you know i've never seen you not in shape  for me i've always been in shape so the fact that i finally got into decent shape the gym doesn't 
[03:27:30]  bother me yet it's like i'm still kind of enjoying it because it's still kind of a newer thing for me  like if i was in david lee roth shape my whole i wouldn't mind i would probably want to mix it up a  little bit but right now i'm just fucking i'm just happy that like my tits don't droop like they  used to see you come and see you're you you have that you have that uh you know that approach that  bearing that nobody would ever expect that you would be a fair fierce and terrifying deadly weapon  you're right you're like one of those little snub-nosed revolvers in an ankle holster nobody's 
[03:28:00]  ever going to see you coming you'll be you'll you this is going to be great i'll be your coach  yeah and he's got a lot of he's got a lot of rage so if he could just channel that into his  workouts hello now i'm a much happier guy lately life is good pirates smile and laugh while they  deal the death blow that's true hello that's true we're on first base you just don't even feel  it look down look down see you're standing there all right i guess it's 10 15 we gotta wrap up and

[03:34:30]  screen it's the world's end now playing in theaters everywhere i'm going and remember roland's quote i like  this uh eric what i was confused by was uh so the whole area that we work in yeah was all a buzz even  over like five o'clock five thirty this morning yeah because one direction was playing the today  show right now the buzz was not about the band playing at fox news correct no it was playing at 
[03:35:00]  the today show what was who was playing at fox news do we know i don't even know once again there  was no banners i don't even think the barbecue people were there roland just came in and dropped  a box on sal's head yeah once again i believe there were more band members on stage at the  fox news concert than there were actually in the audience that would probably be correct yes uh but  uh the today show which is only a block away here in new york from fox news had one direction  yeah so they quarantined off streets i mean it was the biggest thing you'd ever seen i remember 
[03:35:30]  fucking mess two years it was either last year or two years ago uh lady gaga when katie perry was not  stomping her in singles charts played the today show yeah and i walked through it to get to work  and i felt like i was in the michael jackson's moonwalker in the beginning of the movie when uh  when you get like people fainting and there's these giant crowds like i started getting claustrophobic  because i was just trying to move through the crowd to get to work you had the same problem and you 
[03:36:00]  you come to it from a different direction well that was that was gaga uh oh and i was taking  the train that day we weren't on but but this was even bigger because they were closing streets and  everything and eric you sent out a tweet that said uh something to the effect of there were there  was a line of 50 cars waiting to get into your garage that there have been kids camping out all  night to watch this concert and then you wrote hashtag bad parents yeah why well one for letting your 
[03:36:30]  fucking kids camp out on the street for days for anything that you're a horrible parent well when  you're there with your kids yeah camping out on the street yeah you're a horrible parent it's the  summer though that would make them a better parent if anything no it's sleeping on the street waiting  to see one direction it's stupid to not be there with your kid then stupider is not a word stupider  it's not a word eric i'm using his word not on my show not on my show it's more stupid more stupid  thank you for either situation no i would this is way okay it confused me because i would think that 
[03:37:00]  it's a good parent if you bring your kid like i don't want to go see a one direction concert so i'm  not going to camp out like i'm not jealous yeah but i would think that if i was 12 years old and a  girl and a one direction fan yeah and my mom or dad was like yeah i'll camp out with you that would  be like a parent parental bonding thing that i would remember forever and i wouldn't i would say  what a great parent i have it's the summer so it's not like i'm skipping school and they're camping  out with me and we're experiencing this together and we're going to get to see this great wholesome 
[03:37:30]  band you disagree i it's a wholesome experience or bonding whatever when you go to the concert  camping out on the street with your child but it's not like the street it's rockefeller plaza  with security you're saying no go the whole situation is just aggravating because there's  two garages downstairs yeah across the street from each other the line from 7th avenue to the center of  48th was just cars trying to get into these garages right and i'm a monthly at one of them i 
[03:38:00]  couldn't get my car i had to park on 48th like you had to park in a different garage no i on the street  you had to park on the street park on the street go in find the guy that usually takes our cards in  the morning because he handles no other people from here give him my keys i said the car is locked up  in the line he gave me my ticket and then they texted me when the car was brought inside well that  is that is a giant pain in the ass 6 30 at this and they text you at 6 30 is when i got the confirmation 
[03:38:30]  that my car was in the garage and it was secured so what happens if you get a ticket or something  i don't know i because you have to leave your car out on the street for an hour that means but  there was a whole line of people there like there were still people in their cars when i asked when  i parked my car so i guess they're not ticketing people the cops can't even come sure that would  be the prime time for them to come and do it prime time sorry the uh the ideal time now for them to  come and do that but then when you got out of the car on both 48th and 49th the sides of our building 
[03:39:00]  there just groups of people like mob almost so angry of parents and and little kids just walking  towards nbc with signs and outfits and everything and you hate those parents i can't hate the parents  that are showing up now to get online but what about the parent what about 5 a.m is that a little too  early to bring your kids to one direction uh yeah you think so a little bit but i but i know  they're on it i think what eight o'clock or something and you have to line up to get to  i get showing up morning of to do it so what time is the cutoff time for bad parenting 
[03:39:30]  because like if you show up at 2 a.m that's kind of like you're camping out yeah so 2 a.m are those  good parents the people already on the line not camping that were coming with their kids are fine  but what time does it make for a good parent or a bad parent because we if you show up at 2 a.m are  you camping since you got to be there for several hours and 2 a.m is pretty much the middle of the  night pretty much okay so 2 a.m bad parents yeah okay 3 a.m bad parents when you show up with blankets 
[03:40:00]  well a fucking comforter or something okay so what if you show up at 5 a.m what if you show up at 5 a.m  but you brought a chair bad there's no need for that at that point to have a chair at 5 a.m so saying  bad parent no at 5 a.m it seems acceptable for to start lining up for this thing 4 a.m not two  days ago after five how about this how about this how about this 4 a.m yeah chair no blanket good  parent or bad parent no that's still bad parent why because of the chair or because it's 4 a.m because  of the chair what have you brought brought two chairs one for you and one for your kid good parent 
[03:40:30]  bad parent hit him with the chair bad parent you're saying bad parent see i feel like they're  good parents for like going out of their way to experience something that they're going to be  uncomfortable doing but they do it for the joy of their kid yeah you're saying bad parent bad parent  and why exactly i understand you want to do something nice for your kid i get that right but  camping out unacceptable a night before two nights before on the fucking street okay so tell me this 
[03:41:00]  cub scouts cywinoy automatically bad parent you put your kid in cub scouts okay well i was in cub  scouts i was too for one year what what was tiger scout bear scout wolf scout we below whatever that  first that first tier tier is i was second grade third grade that's a bear you were a bear okay you  still are a bear except for when you shave down yeah now send your kids to cywinoy good parent bad  parent bad parent because your kids are camping yeah so you're saying no because they're in the cub 
[03:41:30]  scouts they're in the bears whatever okay all right all right all right kids kids in the sandlot  squints smalls yeah the great hambino yeah good parents or bad parents that they're allowed to play  in a sandlot no they were up in that treehouse making s'mores i believe they had a porno magazine  and they were doing the one thing that no parent should ever allow their child to do  they were camping out overnight good parent or bad parent wait a minute was that on there i'm trying 
[03:42:00]  to remember was that on their property or was that just in the woods technically it was in the  air it was it was in a tree house where was the tree it was on their property good parent okay all  right so it's it's a matter of property that's fine what if they were at a campsite like cywinoy  and they had a tree house yeah a campsite if there's no parents there bad parents bad parents yeah  letting your kids just go into the woods at that age god i can't take this to baby anymore i just  can't i can't do it what if your parent is with them yeah but they're on the sidewalk there's no 
[03:42:30]  sidewalk in the woods but what if they're out of the woods and they're in the street and they're on  the sidewalk fucking horrible parent i don't understand that i can't sal good parent or bad  parent you're camping out with your whole thing is stupid it doesn't make any sense doesn't make any  fucking sense if you're with your kids you're a good parent and you bring them oh she brought  a blanket to make sure the kid doesn't get sick that's a terrible parent you're you're an idiot eric  no you're a terrible parent for letting your kids stay on the street for a day or two waiting for 
[03:43:00]  fucking tickets to go see anything that's not necessarily a bad parent it's like allowing your  kid to yeah if the kids if the kids were four or five in new york city yeah maybe what if they're  waiting for an iphone that's just as bad bad parent yeah all right it's stupid people who wait  for an iphone nagle logic is just the most convoluted it never makes any sense oh a parent  you would sit on the street for two days for a concert ticket no i'm not saying i would sit on  the street but i'm saying if i was or sell you would sit on the street for two days no but that's 
[03:43:30]  not what you're saying you're addressing the point of bad parent parent if i was a little with the kid  at this point if i was 11 okay yes and i was like a little questionable as a kid because i'm sure at  moments my parents did question me i was very unathletic i loved watching professional wrestling  at points my father probably looked at me like i don't know which way this is gonna go he hasn't  brought home a girl yet so the idea of me liking one direction at that phase is not out of the  ordinary right now i listen to uh you know lady gaga records so hang on let me put this guy back on 
[03:44:00]  hold don't hang up uh so i'm 11 years old i want to see one direction i'm like yeah but we got to camp  out dad and my dad's like you know what let's go to target i'm gonna get a tent and i'm gonna camp out  with you starting out wednesday till friday and then me and you sammy boy whatever lifestyle you  choose are gonna watch one direction together to me i'd be like i'd now be sitting here doing this  radio show thinking to myself what a wonderful memory of a great childhood that i had because 
[03:44:30]  of a great parent eric you would say the reverse that that my dad making that decision is irresponsible  parenting and maybe grounds for calling the authorities no i didn't say your dad need to  be arrested okay i was saying it's it's a noble gesture it's not a cfs issue but it's i don't  think it's an acceptable action you don't think it's acceptable it's bad parenting what all right  using your scenario okay what if yeah big event you're 11 years old what if it's survivor series 
[03:45:00]  all right survivor series all right at madison square garden you have to camp out for tickets  for two days right at madison square garden with my dad no by yourself you said the parents that were  camping out with their kids were bad parents yeah and the kids that were there by themselves without  their parents were bad parents no no no in this scenario my dad is with me okay my dad goes you  know what sam i know all you want in life is to sit in the very front row yeah to watch the action in 
[03:45:30]  the squared circle happen right in front of those we already addressed the scenario of you and him  but if you're by him no no no that's not what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about no but  you said the parents that were with their kids were bad parents they are then that's what we're  talking about in eric's mind if you don't contain your kids to a house you're a bad parent or a tree  house that's on your property and squints has to be in the tree house get them in advance what  about people what about it's the today show there's no tickets what about in the movie jack 
[03:46:00]  where robin williams he looks like a grown man yeah but he's actually a child yeah and his parents  let him go off and camp out in his friend's tree house but eventually the tree house gives way because  bill cosby goes in the tree house too good parents are bad parents why is bill cosby there he was the  therapist if you saw the film all right right good parents or bad parents it's not their property but  it is someone's property well you can't tell you could if you didn't know he was a kid you would 
[03:46:30]  it wouldn't be a bad situation so good parents i think it'd just be you know a couple guys having  fun in the tree house so you're saying in 1996 when survivor series was at madison square garden  if my dad had camped out with me outside the ticket booth for two days so we could get front row  tickets that would make him a bad father for camping out for the ticket yes uh travis yeah 
[03:47:00]  you're a parent correct uh-huh are you taking notes no i don't need to take notes why because  like because this is absurd or because you already know this completely you're telling me travis doesn't  camp out for tickets you're telling me that when your daughter she's a little too young to camp out  for stuff right now because she's what four yeah okay so she doesn't have like a passion for things  yet no she's a little kid whatever you put in front of her she's like this is the greatest thing ever  at one point did she or did she not refer to me as her best friend oh yeah so best friend we see 
[03:47:30]  where you know it's fleeting at the moment are you gonna see my best friend tomorrow at work that's  what she said yep tell her i said hello that's when i knew i failed as a parent yeah hey uh eric  all right travis's four-year-old daughter refers to me as her best friend good parent bad parent  all right that could be a bad parent that could be a bad parent i'm not disagreeing with eric all  right so travis's daughter is 10 she's now 10 years old it's six years in the future  travis you are now uh quite a bit heavier you let yourself go a little bit but probably correct 
[03:48:00]  but you love your daughter very much sure and she goes there's a hot new boy band that's playing the  today show and i want to see him as close as possible but the only way to do that is to camp  out now it's august so i don't have any school dad will you camp out with me for two days in new york  city yeah absolutely sure that would make that would make you a bad parent correct eric eric's  gonna be the kind of parent who who his kids gonna be like i want to watch uh i want to go see one 
[03:48:30]  direction at at the today show he's gonna say wake up and watch it on tv yeah it's on tv yeah just watch  it on i'll buy the tickets there's no tickets there's no tickets it's a today show all right  that's why they're camping out yeah no you can just watch it on tv of course he will because there'd  be no sort of semblance of this could be a special moment in this kid's life because unless it's  something eric wants to do oh my father's a fucking asshole he told me to watch the thing on tv  do you know how many camping out on the city street for two days trying to get tickets it's it's not 
[03:49:00]  it it the the city streets when there's thousands of the same age like kids and their parents and  it's not the streets it's rockefeller plaza rockefeller plaza for one thing it's just it's just  littered with security guards and it's a bunch of kids and parents their signs now if you're gonna if  your 12 year old says i'm gonna go camp out with some other 12 year olds and i'll see you in three  days then okay i would have some questions i camped down my parents sent me how old are you i was probably 
[03:49:30]  like uh around that 12 years old age okay but there were probably other parents around no the  parents kept checked in every like half hour right we had a routine but it was fun what about that eric  what if the parents come and check in every couple hours you're still letting your kids camp out on a  street so you're saying no bad parent bad parent i prob i mean at that age i probably wouldn't let  them just like alone yeah because they can just get i don't i don't have a problem i don't have a 
[03:50:00]  problem with not letting your kid but it's the whole like parents that are going with them are  bad parents that i just can't put my head around that's the absurd part to me i can't get it but i  was not going with them to it camping out on the street with your kids yeah what's the big deal  bad parenting that's the solution to the problem though is that being there with your kid how do you  not see that my dad used to drive me to concerts let me go in the venue and he waited in the car  because he wanted to see the artist yeah you know i went back out and he was there he was there the 
[03:50:30]  whole time sat in a parking lot for hours write down the number this is where i'm at he said you're  gonna be a grown-up go see your shitty artist and come back like a jamaican husband with his wife in  the grocery store your dad waited you know jamaican people do that it's true jamaican people wait  the husband they drive to the grocery store as a couple and then the wife goes in to do grocery  shopping and the husband waits in the car that sounds pretty good it's crazy and my dad goes i know you  love the music i'll take you but i don't like him so i'll just wait in the car see that's that's a  good parent because roland will experience what it's like to be on your own but you know how many 
[03:51:00]  wrestling shows my dad went to he thinks wrestling is so stupid yeah my dad took a ton of wrestling  shows and he hated it with a passion right but you take your kid yeah like we're not saying it's a  pleasant thing to camp out in new york city no but it's one of those things that you do you don't do it  every six months you do it like once or twice in your child's entire life and they have this memory  forever unless you think that's bad parenting which eric thinks it's bad parenting and i like  that eric takes a stand here i like that eric is the type of guy who when he has a little nagel of 
[03:51:30]  his own goes no we're not gonna do that no we're not gonna camp out unless it's the opening of a  lego store in which case yes we can camp out even that's not acceptable no if you do this summer  something nagel oh nothing my dad would let me do anything yeah i watched the today show  his name by the way it would be hulk nagel hulk nagel eric good parent or bad parent uh henry  rowan gartner's mom that's true okay you tell me this eric henry rowan gartner he his mother 
[03:52:00]  this kid is 12 years old okay his he breaks his arm and in some sort of freak accident ends up with  the strongest pitching arm in major league baseball this 12 year old's mother lets him go join the  chicago cubs lets him play in the away games and lets him hang out with gary bucey who is also  playing for the cubs and daniel stern um his chaperone who is obviously retarded sorry i'm 
[03:52:30]  correct you he was hanging out with the rocket the rocket yes the rocket gary bucey and retarded  daniel stern who locks himself in lockers was mrs rowan gartner a good parent or a bad parent she  was a bad parent why is that 12 year old letting him go off one to work two the major leagues and  tore around with these degenerates yeah but it was three degenerates these degenerates well gary bucey  was in here and he did strike me as a bit of a degenerate so maybe you're right he was the rocket  though and it was his dream um bernie what's up man how you doing doing great the only thing with 
[03:53:00]  camping out is anything that sam roberts then checked out your podcast for the first time the other  day loving it okay professional broadcaster that's all i got thank you very much bernie what happens  at that what happens if you had to camp out for two days to listen to a sam roberts show online  podcast would you let your kid do that the fact that you would let your kid listen to that as a bad  parent how you get to it is even worse maybe you're right you can't pound lines and when you 
[03:53:30]  grow up you live bonnaroo then you can't you that's how that's how it works maybe that's why  it's bad parenting maybe eric doesn't want to raise a little jam band kid who's going to music  festivals all the time you don't want your kid going to music festivals do you i don't mind going  to the festivals i don't what if it's what if it's okay here's a question what if it's a two-day  festival i'm not going to that dan in kentucky hey i don't care if you have the best kid in the  world or the greatest kid in the world or the worst it doesn't matter take for example the 
[03:54:00]  asshole in cleveland who kidnapped those girls yeah but what if what if there's a what if there's a  parent what if you're why would you let your kid you're missing the point what if the parent is with  you like if you're with your kid who's it saying the parent can't get shot your kid disappears for  20 years well then don't take them anywhere all right dan well that can happen thanks that could  just as easily happen at a grocery store i think i think we got eric's brother on the line yeah  tragedy outside the today show this morning as one random family was attacked a man was shot 
[03:54:30]  and his daughter taken for 20 years even though police were marching up and down because there  were a bunch of 12 year olds camping out to see one direction see it could happen no it couldn't  you go you go to any concert at the garden you see the parents let the kids go in they go we'll be  out here when the show's over yeah but none of those parents have the last name of nagel is that right  eric no that's right they all have iphones they all communicate scott in jersey that's another thing 
[03:55:00]  what's what's another thing old man nagel what's another thing being a kid with a phone  it's 2013 like i didn't have a phone until i was deep into high school maybe a senior in high school  and that's fine yeah but you know why that's also because they didn't exist it was 2000 yeah 13 years  ago don't you think that maybe you had one when you were a freshman if you were now if you're a  freshman now you'd have yeah you'd have to you can't be eric's eric's kids are going to be the 
[03:55:30]  last kid like eric's gonna last kid to have the phone really bad kids because they're not going to  be allowed to do anything and so they're going to have to be very mischievous yeah it's too many  rules eric you can't be so stringent or they go to mom like dad's at it again scott in jersey  eric's gonna have a high chair at the donkey kong machine up at fun stop pretty soon  i don't know what that means he posted that eric it seems good parent or bad parent mike tv's dad  okay how about this mike tv's dad lets him travel all the way to some place that looks like england 
[03:56:00]  but wasn't england i'm not exactly sure where it was school was definitely england but this factory  didn't appear to be england because charlie didn't have an accent at all mike tv's dad lets  him not only go to the wonka factory with his irresponsible mother but promises him that at the  age of 13 12 12 not to your 12 son at the age of 12 he is allowed to have a revolver uh fully 
[03:56:30]  functioning revolver good parent or bad parent it was different times back then  kids had pellet guns no no he wanted to give him a real gun no i know  okay it was a different time back then so he's not acceptable now but then  back in the day back in the day that's what they did  say what about the goonies that's wait  i like that eric i don't know if in the 1970s 12 year olds were giving guns i don't know if that's 
[03:57:00]  the case for sure but it's possible it's possible i wasn't there uh garth and he had guns in the  70s that's true and look how well he turned out garth in indiana hey eric hey man you're not going  to want to be that dick dad dude um when you finally have kids and you look in your kids eyes  and you fucking shoot them down like that it's going to break their heart it's going to change  their lives so they'll be a dick now i understand that you don't want to disappoint your kids but  there's times and places for doing that where you'll take them to concerts and to vacations and 
[03:57:30]  things like that not sitting on the fucking street for a day or two trying to get dad can  we go see one direction not till you're 29 son something tells me eric is going to disappoint  his kids all the time yeah he's going to love no problem well you see him with the interns he  loves being in charge yeah so he's just going to be just mandating all the time all there's gonna  be all these rules in the nagel household i like that though eric but he won't enforce them  because he'll be downstairs playing with his toys yeah and what are you doing up there
