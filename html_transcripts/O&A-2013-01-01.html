<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous anecdote from one of the hosts about a close call with the Secret Service during an encounter with President George H.W. Bush.  The story detailed the imposing security presence and the host's navigational mishap that almost landed him in trouble.

Next, comedian Louis C.K. appeared as a guest in the studio. He recounted a lengthy, self-deprecating story about getting his expensive new boat, the "Dawgz," stuck in the mud in the Harlem River. The narrative involved his daughters, a park ranger, unhelpful police officers, and a rescue eventually facilitated by a helpful stranger and the rising tide.

The show then transitioned to a heated segment dubbed "the Guy Fieri saga."  This involved a contentious exchange between recurring guest Sam Roberts and Guy Fieri, stemming from a prior incident where Fieri allegedly gave Roberts alcohol despite his non-drinking status. The discussion involved multiple apologies from Fieri, accusations, insults (including the use of the word "pussy"), and escalating banter, eventually culminating in a somewhat strained reconciliation.  Mayor Menino was briefly mentioned, along with Fieri's upcoming restaurant opening.  Anthony Bourdain then called in to deliver a harsh critique of Fieri's new restaurant.  Fieri himself joined the call to address the criticism and the earlier conflict with Roberts. The segment concluded with playful insults and an invitation from Fieri for the hosts to visit his restaurant, even offering a Napa Valley trip.  A further phone interview with Fieri followed, focusing on his restaurant, his barbecue team ("Motley Q"), and his generally positive attitude. The hosts jokingly questioned his menu (particularly the lack of pizza), his past appearances on the show, and a negative *New York Times* review.  A side conversation touched upon a previous angry studio guest. Fieri mentioned his new daughter and promised to send the hosts cheesecake. He also mentioned receiving encouragement from Donnie Wahlberg and another unnamed individual.

Opie then shared an embarrassing story from college about having Thompson Twins lyrics ("Hold Me Now") pinned to his dorm room wall as relationship inspiration, leading to a comedic segment guessing the song and Opie's further embarrassment.

Penn Jillette joined the show to discuss being pulled over by the police, his views on religion (including a story about a Hasidic Jew who became an atheist after listening to his podcast), psychic readings, and a private psychic reading he performed at Steven Spielberg's party.  The show delved into a discussion about psychics and cold/hot readings, touching upon the techniques used and the vagueness of predictions, with John Edward referenced as an example. Penn recounted a story about performing elaborate fake séances, highlighting a situation where a subject's random choice unexpectedly foiled their planned illusion.

Jim Norton then shared a lengthy anecdote, titled "Superhero Jimmy," about chasing an MTA bus with a "911 Call Police" sign, detailing his frustrated calls to 911 and the bus's erratic route.  This was followed by a story from Jim Florentine detailing his childhood molestation by a wrestling photographer, who later appeared on a sex offender website. Florentine also shared a similar story emailed to him by another victim of the same perpetrator.

The show then shifted to a discussion about childhood encounters with potentially predatory adults, including humorous, dark anecdotes about the hosts' parents' apparent naiveté.  This evolved into a darkly comedic discussion about the ease with which a child molester could have targeted them, followed by a humorous anecdote involving trading photos and kisses. The conversation segued into a discussion of the song "Gangnam Style" and gas siphoning, escalating into increasingly absurd and offensive scenarios involving theft, home invasions, and carjacking, spurred by a caller's concerns about gas price gouging.  A listener provided real-time updates about gas price gouging and police response.  Actor Christopher Lloyd then joined the show to promote his movie "Excuse Me for Living," discussing his career (including his roles as Doc Brown and Reverend Jim), filming anecdotes, Andy Kaufman, and a house fire.

The final segment largely focused on Opie's plans for a summer house, interspersed with other discussions.  Opie recounted a recent house fire and discussed irreplaceable mementos.  His new pool, filling faster than expected, led to a humorous exchange with Ang about the water shut-off. The search for a summer house, with several locations (Jersey Shore, upstate New York, Long Beach Island, Mataquan, Bayhead, Lavalette, Spring Lake, and Cape Cod) considered, dominated the remaining time, punctuated by the song "I'm Sexy and I Know It," jokes about "Crazy Jim," and speculation about unseen company executives observing the broadcast.  The show concluded with further discussion of Opie's summer house hunt and additional comedic banter.  Beyond the regular hosts, Opie and Anthony, and the DJ, referred to as E-Rock and later DJ Sex, no other explicitly stated guests were present in the studio during this segment.

[00:01:30]  his whole attitude talk i'm i'm passed i'm through blah blah blah they fucking turn around and act like  i'll kill you if you fucking do anything stupid so i'm watching his come down the road with like you  know the cop cars and all i swear to god it was like electrical storm was coming yeah the  fucking energy around the standing president of the united states you can't even compare so i was  supposed to go out do and i had been like on stage and i'm fucking doing jokes and shit and like 
[00:02:00]  everything had changed and no one thought anything was like good anymore right it's just like just  the president's here like anything else you could have fucking came out and nobody else would have  cared about anything so i was supposed to introduce him uh me and my partner introduce him and then  exit left we introduce him and we exit right right into him as he's walking out and we do that thing  where you got like a shuffle like you know you only gotta like shuffle and he's like he's like being 
[00:02:30]  like real nice and all he gives is a pat on the shoulder and all i kept thinking in my head was  what an enormous fucking skull this man has i just like i couldn't it didn't even seem like a person  to me with all this shit around it his head just looked like a fucking refrigerator and i'm like i come  off the secret service because we had accident the wrong way jumped into our shit and like you would  have fucking been killed for don't you ever fuck you know and i'm like dude i didn't fucking ask to be 
[00:03:00]  here you guys ask me right and they're like all right okay you didn't mean all right come over here  then they start re-fucking yelling like don't ever next there ain't gonna be a fucking next time right  i'm not traveling with this man i fucking turned right instead of left let me out of a fucking just  let me out of a well what were you are you serious yeah they were fucking crazy with us yes they wanted  to fucking kill us so you didn't get a photo with the president no i don't get a photo with anybody i 
[00:03:30]  know you like to do i do you don't do it no you don't you regret not getting one with the president  no wow oh you know what a bunch of people took pictures that's right i have them somewhere i don't  know where they are because the people from the stage took them and sent them to me and you see us  fucking stopped in front of him and blocking his way and we're both shoulder to shoulder so he can't  get around us i want to see that i didn't even fucking think of that but i'm also you see me  standing in front of that fucking seal like you have that like little podium with the seal on it  and here's the weird thing they only put the seal up when he arrives no you don't have it there all 
[00:04:00]  day it's like a guy whose job is to stay like 20 feet in front of him with a seal right and get it  on the podium just in time i've seen the motorcade go by for uh bush uh yeah bush jr i've seen bush  jr and obama and you're right it's like an electric storm man yeah it is something to see especially  when the first cars start coming and then they just keep coming and coming and vans and and an ambulance  and uh and wherever you see motorcycle cops it's just unbelievable wherever you see them they 
[00:04:30]  already have a way to the hospital oh god yeah they got it all figured out that happens all day  long like they know where the clearest hospital is and there's guys that are in every tree down the  road you know and they and and it isn't just one hospital they have their way to fight there was  actually people in trees that day and because we're down in florida there was frogmen in water  really there were people in boats and then guys just in water really what the fuck that's 
[00:05:00]  unbelievable what is this cost well that's a good question because when we saw obama at the view  not not actually on the show but going to the view me and jimmy stood on the corner like idiots  like idiots for an hour and a half did you wave like hey we could barely see him and then i snuck  around and figure out a better vantage point when he left so i got to see the whole motorcade come you  know literally five feet in front of me but they bring in the dump trucks now ronnie yes so you  can't so you can't even barrel through the big sanitation trucks filled up with sand filled up 
[00:05:30]  with sand they block everything with those now too so you can't just barrel a car into the motorcade  it's a smart right smart move i mean every time they cross a cross street there's fucking two one  on each side there were sanitation trucks everywhere now what do you think that does to the psychology of  the guy with that job that's got to fuck you up pasta pasta you've got to be crazy and at another  point they always say the gigantic depression hits when you stop being president sure when you stop 
[00:06:00]  being president it just feels like i don't know what the fuck i'm right sure do it i mean especially  if you lose an election if you go eight years you know like the constitution said i can't do it anymore  you know they did they did a documentary on the white house and i i thought stupid me that the  president walked around most of the white house by himself if he wanted to hell fucking that was  right yeah he's being he's being shadowed the entire time in the white house maybe in the  residence quarters but it seems like they're even inside that but kind of near the door when you're 
[00:06:30]  the president you're not in charge of your own body of course around those guys so when reagan was  shot they treated him like a fucking rag doll it was just um they were showing some doc with it the  other night where they had just started fucking manhandling him to find out where he was shot  not asking him and then ripped all of his clothes off in the back of the thing so he came out buck  ass naked when he uh was at the hospital huh they literally drug him out by his balls they were  holding his balls they said this long we are crazy i mean seriously as human beings i just honestly think 
[00:07:00]  that we're crazy fucking they lost one after you have to kennedy and they almost lost gerald ford  because two two women took shots at him i mean squeaky from and there's another one like within a  week but one of them was on an whatever they call an unscheduled stop right he was supposed to go and  gerald ford wanted to walk and then they never want you to do that right and god damn it there was a  woman with a fucking pistol hoping he came that way and she tried to fucking shoot him i mean it's like 
[00:07:30]  the secret service sounds like they're being overly protective but it's like yeah there really are a lot  of people that want to kill the sitting president so they have to be fucking crazy after gfk got shot  that's a humiliation for the whole country's humiliated yeah it's embarrassing but ronnie  introduced bush damn that is a very good one yeah it's a nice one and i'm glad i fucked it up like  that and i'm like you know because then you got that story i i introduced the band bush once so  we're how was that we're pretty similar pretty similar yeah from highbrow conversations with

[00:14:30]  deal because they went they went and got us food the cops they bought us a whole chicken and some rice  really nice guys then they come back and now there's a huge expanse of mud between us and them  food and they go we don't know how you're gonna get this they put it in a garbage bag  and i start throwing a line to them but it's not making it of course all these people on the shore  everybody knows who i am now so there's people in the park in the shore who are just on a rail just 
[00:15:00]  watching me and i throw i'm throwing this i like i've tied a pot to the rope and i throw it and it  gets about halfway there and i'm pull it back and i'm covered in mud because every time the rope comes  back it's totally covered in mud and i have to get the mud off so it's not heavy every time i go to  throw it all the people on the side half of them are going well pull it for you louie you can do it  and then i when i miss they go oh man that dude sucks  it's like playing left field for the yankees it's totally the yankee stadium crowd 
[00:15:30]  people booed people wow and i couldn't get it so finally the cops pulled over a guy who was fishing  and they used his uh rod to throw me a line cast a line and cast a weight over nice so you're  i tied it to a rope they pulled and then i had to pull dinner onto the boat i was so soaked in mud  and sweat totally then it was chicken mole after that that's right had your kids calmed down by that

[00:26:30]  problem but it looks like the hatch of a submarine and it's headed towards lower manhattan like that's  actually that's what i'm seeing and i'm sure it's not that but my main concern is it's not lit and it  could cream anything that hits it's going down and the guy goes all right well i'll call a boat and send  him to you so he hangs up and like 20 minutes later there's nobody there and i call him back  and we have the light on it and i have this weird feeling like is it gonna shoot at us 
[00:27:00]  like we're really freaking out fucking starts coming at you yes chris rock fell asleep like he's just  like you guys are idiots and he went to sleep are you wearing light vests that's white people's  shit you don't wear light vests no no i don't usually the kids do observe water safety what  are you a fucking quent never put on a knife jacket again take a bat to the radio submarine in the  water hard submarine so anyway we call i call back and they're not sending anybody and i said i one  point i got crazy and i was like i said what are you what do you do if somebody's you are the coast 
[00:27:30]  guard and i am saying to you now there's a there's a submarine attacking lower manhattan this is like  saying it this is like jimmy's story with the bus only on the water yes when you call for the stolen  bus like how would why wouldn't if that did happen someone would see it and call in and they're like  we're trying to get park police over here i'm like send a fucking helicopter uh we know about it  mr ck how do you know my name how do you know my name right they knew exactly what this thing was 
[00:28:00]  oh wow and he kept asking me to hover we kept hovering around it and stuff and then finally  this big police boat comes and shines like a massive light on it and then he calls hails me on  the radio uh hey captain are you the one who uh captain who reported this and i go yeah and he goes uh  it's a mooring ball it's been there since 1965  and i go i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i wasted your time you didn't know you've never seen a bunch 
[00:28:30]  of moorings dancing no i know i know that was delicious well that's all right you thought it was  sean connery defecting  mooring ball oh big iron fucking uh yeah it's on a chain yeah i guess people tie up to it and i'm  like how what if you don't see it and everybody the guy in the well most people navigating those  waters know what the fuck they're doing right that's why it's probably marked on a chart that 
[00:29:00]  there's a mooring probably when you were off to the side getting away from because you initially  said it was coming towards you yeah leaving away it looks like it was going towards me because it's on  a chain to the bottom yeah so when the current takes it it looks like it's moving it's not just  drifting i was gonna say it must have like just the river moving the current i'm a i have no business  being on the water because oh yeah it looks like it's moving in one direction to me because i'm  fucking moving so it's making like a circle and i keep moving around it and i'm going holy shit 
[00:29:30]  where the fuck are we jeez we're really moving far away there's a giant thing coming out of the water  that's the statue of liberty you idiot it's like a floating sea from another planet that's  manhattan new york city it's atlantis i'm sorry i found atlantis i said that i thought anthony would  have said it that's fucking funny man i love your boat story they're fucking great there's no one  that shouldn't have a boat it's fun it's fun as shit to be on it i would you have sunk if you hit 
[00:30:00]  that though that would have that would kill oh yeah yeah and i would have hit it if i hadn't  stopped at the statue of liberty to show it off to christen them well why don't they have a light  on a mooring wall it seems like everybody and that that's actually out in the open new york  harbor is i'm the only idiot they know it's the only asshole it has some tape on it some reflective  tape yeah they said it you know but yeah they don't expect submarines put reflective they do they  like to be seen at night i'm sure if you don't don't trip when you're coming off stage on the 
[00:30:30]  submarine put some electrical tape down so you can see it when you're coming off on the steps tape  down the cable i'm sure if you looked at like where you were and looked at a chart it would probably  be there probably like mooring ball it's an old mooring ball six two five and if a big tanker wants  to sit there yeah then they just instead of dropping an anchor is that because it's too this way it  prevents it from going to the shallower water to get close it can do it in the deep water yeah it's  simpler mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down yeah that's a pain you just  hook up to it and you're hang out you're there how heavy is a fucking mooring ball that it can keep 
[00:31:00]  a ship in place what's it what's it lats into the water with but it's how big chains big chains  how big does it float a safety pin what how could it be that heavy and float yeah well like any like  you know like a ship like a aircraft carrier is pretty heavy it's a big hollow ball it has buoyancy  full of air buoyancy and at the bottom it's a giant fucking anchor it's really hard to push  air down to the underwater that's very hard yeah air is difficult yeah that's a great fucking story  that is fantastic two horrible boat stories and you stayed there you stayed there like an hour 
[00:31:30]  to find out what it was it for safety purposes for other people or to find out what it was i was  concerned with about somebody wrecking into it really yeah i wanted to go i didn't want to be doing  it i wanted to go home but you probably thought it was terrorism you're so you're you're when you do  when you the boat shit they give you to read yeah you know you're responsible for everybody out  there yeah yeah were you were you like running through a fantasy in your head of louis ck 
[00:32:00]  terrorists thwarted by comic louis ck all anthony said was louis ck and we all burst  we all knew the text he's just he's just daydreaming like yeah yes everybody's gonna know now that i'm  really a captain but instead the headline reads in quotes comic arrested for pranking police  local local comic yeah you thought that there was gonna be like good cool you saw something and you 
[00:32:30]  said something good job that's a local comic known for playing grandpa's  comes across piece of hardware that's been there since the world's fair yes  just call the police are being attacked by a giant bowling ball  it's a big circle and it's just hanging out there for 51 years  finally somebody caught it god that's fucking great man  opian anthony's worst of 2012 continues right now hit yet now now

[00:51:00]  would fucking frame that in the restaurant i would put something outside saying uh this asshole from  the new york times saying whatever he said that was bad you pick one of the many quotes he had  and then you go and then you go come on in and try for yourself fuckers something like that i think  would fly well i i think that uh i think you're right in that whole piece and that's kind of what we did  where when i came into town yesterday is listen the critics are critics and they're going to have  their opinion and you can't stop that i what the one the you know opinion i really care about is the

[00:53:00]  that compared to some of the you know real nice fine dining high-end restaurants that are typically  reviewed and that that might be something a little bit disappointing for him i mean i don't know what  was going on but yeah like i said i it's my food it's my team it's my place i stand by it do we make  mistakes yes could it mean that every single thing he had was horrible that day i don't think that the  odds are in that no that's impossible it is is you guys come down check it out yourself you've been

[00:56:30]  sandwich hey guy my restaurant is expanding just want to brag a little bit and it should fh we  finally got the uh we finally got the go ahead we were dealing with some red tape out there in  huntington yeah and uh we finally did i tell you even putting a smoke machine and stage lights that's  right rock and roll so we're finally expanding we've been waiting a long time for them to give  us the go ahead and uh i'm proud to say my brother's restaurant fh riley's out there in  huntington is expanding oh we're very happy to start with huh how many square feet was it at the 
[00:57:00]  beginning about uh 220 that's it really 220 at a takeout counter that's like uh we're gonna go to  about 400 when you make square footage it really cuts down quickly on the size i have a confession  i never understood that square foot shit like if you ask me how how many square feet my home is i  i'll tell you it's a four bedroom length by width i don't know length by width i don't know i i could 
[00:57:30]  tell you by rooms it's like like the bar area is roomy and then the dining hall is even roomier i like  saying how many cubic feet my house is because i got high ceilings makes it sound better very very  well that's why guys are bad at math exactly how's business at the restaurant you doing all right in  general or we we were slamming yesterday um we had a great you know we had a great day and i was  funny ran into all kinds of buddies that were in town or from out of town that just happened to be

[00:58:30]  here wow yeah yes don't don't invite him to the party so it's been it's been and like i said we're  just uh you know we just continue to work man just continue we had big meetings yesterday went  through food taste the question was you have you taste your food of course i taste my food i mean  this is what all i do and and do it it's kind of like your kid striking out at p-ball you know you  sir you know little league i mean you can't strike out at people i guess but you know it's it's 
[00:59:00]  heartbreaking but you pick it up you go back after it you handle it again the next day and  and some of the food that you're trying there it's just you know it's just an example of what we do  i mean it's just great flavor big food yeah uh you know unique styles and hopefully a good party  rock and roll  that was good all right that's good guy now we're learning keep the positive energy keep rocking  keep keep the fist pumping fucking great man that's right hey what kind of music you got in

[01:17:00]  right  right  stay with me  let loving start  yeah see  aw  nice right  let loving start  but would she really say you were a dreamer  say you were a dreamer  you would say something  and she'd say  oh but you're a dreamer  i uh  i had dreams of doing radio back then  yes  i was dreaming  with two of a kind  i was dreaming uh  for something better  for myself  so she was a dreamer too  cause you're two of a kind  yep  you were dreaming about doing radio  and she was dreaming about somebody  who didn't hang lyrics  on a college door 
[01:17:30]  we were gonna do this together man  uh  both of us searching for some  perfect world  we know we'll never find  oh  that's uh  that's uh  like premonition of serious  xm satellite radio  perfect world  we know we'll never find  because uh  it's just  i got it  i got it  i got it  i got it  i got it  where's that dick  oh  so perhaps  you can't do that bit  we're going to chicago 
[01:18:00]  but  you can't  do  anything  oh shit  i'm shutting down my twitter for 12 hours  so these people can't get to me  sorry  keep up your good nature  12 hours  i'm going dark  so perhaps  i should leave here  yeah  yeah  go far away  go far away  he went  he left long island  and went to um  college  that's how you get your dreams done  you gotta move away from home  right  don't these people understand this by now  oh they should 
[01:18:30]  nothing happens in your hometown  wake the fuck up  get out of there  leave  but you know that there's nowhere  that i'd rather be  than with you here today  did she know you fucking felt this way  that's kind of true actually  did you know she  did she know that you felt this way  oh yeah  and you told her about this song  and said  baby  this song is about us man  it's our song  and like she'd be talking while it was on  and you'd go  this part  this  I stopped breathing again 
[01:19:00]  so wait  now  would you rewrite  I gotta remind myself to breathe  what  would you write  hold me now  warm my heart  stay with me  let loving start  would you actually put the parenthesis  that says  let loving start  which implies  I wrote it as is man  oh yeah  you ask if I love you  well what can I say  what can you say  you know that I do  and that this is just one of those games  that we play  so you two would probably quarrel  no it's very literal  they played Monopoly  so it's just one of the games 
[01:19:30]  they played Doctor  because she was six  and he was 18  oh kick your legs now  why is Iraq picking his nose  oh Iraq  don't pick your nose in there  it's disgusting  he probably had some food from last night  oh no  it's coming out his trunk  are we done  so I'll sing you a new song  are we done  oh no  please don't cry anymore  oh you're fucking helping her out  don't cry  and then I'll ask your forgiveness  though I don't know just what I'm asking it for 
[01:20:00]  so that when you two would fight  you'd be asking for her to  hey let's straighten this out  you don't know  you just want to get it better  you just want to get to that better place  you wanted the hurting to stop  right  let's move on  let's move on  let loving start  emotion  oh oh hold me now  oh  oh  oh  I'm sorry  can we hear the song  wait are you done with the lyrics  there's no more yeah  oh good  you want to know  you wrote them out  they're beautiful  short beautiful poem 
[01:20:30]  there it is  I was as lame as they come  when I was 18  I would think you were lame  if you just enjoyed this once on the radio  if you said I heard this once  and didn't turn it off  I'd be like what a douche  I was extremely innocent  before life fucking  beat the shit out of me  I'm not innocent anymore  motherfuckers  is that believable  this second verse  this is your verse  so  yeah that described  that we know  we'll never find 
[01:21:00]  so perhaps  I should leave here  yeah  yeah  go far away  it's Geneseo  but you know  there's no other  I'd rather be  than with you  here today  oh  oh  oh  oh  someone to the  hold a wall  hold me now  hold me now  oh  oh  hold and wall  that was a cock  singing to him  hold me now

[01:26:30]  one of my favorite guests  that comes on the  opie and anthony show  on a regular basis  and this is one of those  multi-part segments  where we chop up  a little bit  from here and there  and paste it all together  and hopefully  you find it entertaining  we're going to start off  with Penn Jillette  talking about  getting pulled over  and then of course  going into a religious  discussion  Penn Jillette  doing what he does best  talk in depth  here it is  opie and anthony's  worst of 2012  you know that brings me  back to your podcast  because I said it  before the show  but you got  you got stopped 
[01:27:00]  by an officer  out there  where do you live  LA area  well Vegas  oh Vegas  excuse me  you're out there  we covered this material  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  and you were texting  but your car  was completely stopped  completely stopped  and this new law  just went in  that you're not allowed  to look at your screen  ever  ever  and that law  just went in  and you know  the day the law  went in I guess  I stopped at a stoplight  and I checked  about three blocks  from my house  I checked  my email  and the light turns  and the guy cherry tops  and as I explained 
[01:27:30]  many times  every artist  and he had to get  off his phone  so he could pull  you over  I was in Central Park  the other day  and I got video  of it  but I just  can't go down  that road  a cop  driving  and texting  I'm like  we're all doing it  who are we kidding here  and I do have the video  but I feel like  that would be  just a completely  dick move  because I do  support the cops  and stuff in general  but anyway  so he stops you  for texting  at a red light  right  but you know  every artist  has his venue 
[01:28:00]  where he is his best  and I believe  I am at my best  when pulled over  by police officers  and the reason is  that I don't do drugs  and I don't drink  so I always have  this feeling of innocence  that other people  don't have  any of my friends  that are pulled over  they're afraid  there's a little dope  in the car somewhere  or maybe there's  a little tiny bit  of alcohol  in their blood  or they're just  going to be  a little careful  I don't care  I know there's  nothing in my car  it's a brand new car  so he comes over 
[01:28:30]  and I go  hey  do you keep a diary  what  do you keep a diary  do you know how  no no  do you keep a diary  I don't  because this is  a special day for you  you've just pulled over  the first all electric car  that's in Nevada  and you know something  you know something  this is the first one  this is a Nissan Leaf  they come out in July  and I've got the first one  and you pulled it over  do you know what that means  do you know why  do you know what that means  because I'll tell you  what that means  that means when we're 
[01:29:00]  pulled over  stopped here  if we were in  a regular combustion car  the engine would be idling  which means those  cute little polar bears  they'd be kind of fucked  but with the way we are now  with an electric car  just sitting here  and you standing there  we could stand  here talking forever  we're not hurting  the environment  we could stand here  until some drunk driver  comes along  boom  runs you over  and you're dead  we'll be fine  he goes well I hope  that doesn't happen  and I go that's exactly  my point  our hopes and dreams  are different  and he says 
[01:29:30]  you know I need to see  your paperwork  I go what is that  he goes you know  your license  I go yeah  and what else  and he says  your registration  and insurance  I go let me tell you  something cool  if the registration  and insurance  is not some place  in this car  that I can find it  an assistant gets fired  there's going to be  somebody you know  college student  working hard  who's getting her  ass fired  because of you  that's going to be  on your head  you know  and I say 
[01:30:00]  now I've got to  I've got to use  my phone  to look into the  use it as a light  to look in the  glove compartment  he said you can't  have a handheld  device in your hand  when you're in  control of the vehicle  I said but I believe  you're in control  of the vehicle  because you pulled  me over  and if I wanted  to drive away  now you'd stop me  so you're in control  of the vehicle  so I'm going  he said well  no turn your  overhead light on  I said I don't know  how to  it's a brand new  car  did I mention that  so I pull out  the book  the book on the leaf  and I start 
[01:30:30]  thumbing through it  and he goes  your license and  registration is not  going to be in there  and I go no no  I haven't really  read the book  and I thought we  could go through  it together  and I go you know  you're standing  there in Vegas  with all these  drunk drivers  you're in a really  dangerous position  you want to get  in the car with me  so I finally  he kind of reaches  in and goes  here's your  license and  here they all  are and they're  all fine  he's not helping  me  and we go  no he's not  mad at all  he's just kind of  laughing and 
[01:31:00]  exasperated  and just kind of  going up  you're going to  write about this  he goes I have  I go you know  I'm on my way  home  we're having  movies there  you want to  come by  so we just  have a fabulous  time with him  and it goes  and we're probably  pulled over for  like 15 minutes  you know  and he finally  says  well I'm just  going to let you  off with a warning  this time  I go do you  think that makes  any difference  to me at all  do you think  this is going  to change my  behavior in any  way whatsoever  he says no  all just a 
[01:31:30]  waste of time  yeah but it was  wonderful I love  it and you know  when you  you enjoyed the  conversation  I love getting  pulled over by  police because  most people when  I'm talking walk  away from me  but he can't  you know and I  guess I kind of  crossed a line  saying that I  hoped he got  hit by a drunk  driver but he  knew in my heart  I didn't mean it  he knew it was  just a joke and  also that's wicked  dangerous I don't  like the cops do 
[01:32:00]  that because in  Vegas at any  given time 40% of  the people on the  road are shit  faced yeah you  know everybody's  driving drunk there  I mean the two  things we're good  at in Vegas is  driving drunk and  suicide  suicide oh of  course they kind  of bury that  don't they that's  not in the papers  all the time  that's actually  that's the new  slogan what  happens in Vegas  stays in Vegas  come here to  kill yourself  that's what they  mean by that  people are  fucking killing  themselves  that's why  they're staying  in Vegas  I'll tell you  something creepy  you know we  were working on  you know we do 
[01:32:30]  the bullet catch  in our show so  we do a lot of  handgun stuff we  had a lot of  training and so  we were at one  of these shooting  ranges you know  yeah and the guy  says oh man  this creeps me  out so much  the guy says  you know the  horrible thing  about working  here is when  the shooting  stops and I  go what  and you know  sometimes you  know we sit  at the desk  it's a 24  hour shooting  place guy  comes in and  asks you can  rent a gun and 
[01:33:00]  some ammo and  he goes into the  range and we're  sitting here doing  paperwork and we  hear bang  bang bang  oh my god  he said then  nothing  and then we  know we gotta  call the police  and clean up  oh how often  I mean I  didn't I didn't  ask him  enough where it  bothers him  you just asked  often  I'm saying if  that happens to  be once in a  hundred years  I'm pretty freaked  out  and you know  you're sitting  there you're on  the night shift  at a gun range 
[01:33:30]  in Vegas  how much  you get paid  for that  yeah  and you're  sitting there  and all you're  hearing all night  is bang  bang  bang  bang  bang  bang  bang  you know  get the tv  on over there  checking your  texts  doing a little  bit of paperwork  bang  bang  bang  bang  wow  I learned  something  well you  think that when  you came in  they would say  how'd you do  with the tables  yeah exactly  that should be  the first question  before they give  you the fucking  pistol  how you feeling  today  how you feeling  Opie and  Anthony's worst  of 2012 
[01:34:00]  I do want  to talk about  the last story  we were talking  about from your  book  the Hasidic  Jew guy  who decided  I can't do  this anymore  and he chose  you to show  him the light  orthodox Jew  and he had  been following  that his whole  life  and a very  serious  I mean  a scholar  and stuff  had studied  that  and then  listening to  my radio  show  and you know  now Penn  Sunday School  he began  questioning  more and more  things  and became 
[01:34:30]  a full  out atheist  and in  that kind  of strong  community  that changes  your whole  life  I mean  it did  lead to  divorce  it's arguments  over where  his children  go to school  you know  they go to  Hebrew school  and so on  and he came  out  it's so humbling  you know  after the show  you know  we always hang  out and talk  to everybody  after the show  so there's  big crowds  around us  and then  after the show  there's a few  people that wait  behind  because they want  to talk a little  longer  and if you're  lucky  those are good  looking women 
[01:35:00]  say  I want you  to sign  my breast  and you go  okay  but I'm going  to use my  middle name  too  and you need  to have my  social security  number  and maybe I'll  draw a little  picture of my  children  when I get to  the underneath  part where it  has the good  heft  and I'm not going  to use a pen  and it should  be done  in saliva  it'll be very  it'll be very  very nice  and you know  the perfect  breast is  a lot of  people don't  know this  but it's  55% below  the nipple  and 45%  above  and that's  the problem  with implants  a lot of  times they put  too much 
[01:35:30]  above  you want  that 45  underneath  right where  it says  Gillette  the famous  teardrop  exactly  of course  of course  what's an  example of a  perfect breast  who's got a  perfect  I've got two  of them  but mine are  B cups  they're not  really big  enough  who's got a  big perfect  tit  Seika did  Seika  had perfect  teardrop tits  she just sent  me her  autobiography  yeah I've read  it it's great  is it good  yeah it's really  good  she follows us  on twitter  too  she seems to  be a fan  of the show  I don't know  and I liked 
[01:36:00]  her because  no matter  what she was  doing in porno  and how  nude she was  she always  had a little  scarf on  there was always  that little  accent  a little  class  she was like  Batman  she believed  the accessories  really mattered  she had her  little you know  fuck scarf  and he had  his utility  belt  I don't know  how he knows  what he's  going to need  I'm going to  need this  thing that  shoots exactly  75 yards  and just has  this exact  hook that  fits right  into there  I'm going to  bring that  with me  tonight  I need that  thank you  Alfred  so the guy 
[01:36:30]  comes to you  in Vegas  he's one of  the ones  waiting afterwards  and he says  it's great  because he says  you know  I was an  Orthodox Jew  and I listened  to your show  and I've  become an  atheist  and it's  a really  big deal  for me  and when  someone says  that  it's so  intense  you kind  of go  thank you  and you  kind of  try to run  away  it's very  hard to give  the appropriate  response back  because it  means everything  to me  I understand  the power  of it  but you  don't know  what to say  you kind  of do that  eye contact  thing 
[01:37:00]  and he goes  you know  there was  bacon  on the  airplane  but I  wanted to  have my  first  tray  meal  with you  and I  go  come on  backstage  so we  go backstage  but did you  have any  doubt there  or I mean  that's a big  responsibility  I guess so  except that I  don't believe  in God  so you  were overly  excited  like let's  do this  so I  went back  and I  go sure  eat anything  you want  and he  goes well  it's turkey  and it's  fruit  and I  guess it's  not actually 
[01:37:30]  been blessed  but it's  not very  exciting  I was kind  of hoping  when I  went backstage  you'd have  like big  bacon  cheeseburgers  and I  go we  don't have  it all  the time  it's not  like the  non-Jews  all we do  is eat  bacon  which is  a mistake  we should  so we  call  we find out  if the  place is  open  and then  all of  us  the piano  player  and our  crew  and everybody  just go  out for  this  perverse  communion  last supper  first supper  thing  we put him  in the middle  like you 
[01:38:00]  know he's  he's like  Jesus  in the  you know  the da Vinci  painting  we're on  each side  and we  just say  you know  we want  and the  waitress  comes over  you know  and says  what would  you guys  like  we're  already  for  everybody  until  the  ghost  we'll  have  clam  chowder  clams  on the  half  shell  oysters  we'll  have  the pork  burger  a side  of  bacon  and  shrimp  and she  goes  who's  that  for  and the  other  goes  for him  so then  he's  sitting  there 
[01:38:30]  and all  of a  sudden  all  this  food  this  is  food  this  guy's  knocking  on 40  he's  in his  30s  you know  this  is  food  that  for  his  entire  life  he  has  been  told  is  pure  evil  he's  spent  his  life  avoiding  this  and  now  the  whole  table  is  full  of  it  and  one  of  our  crew  guys  who's  kind  of  a  punk  just  goes  you know  man  I was  going to  go home  and watch  TV  and if  you don't  actually  eat  this  shit  I'm  going to  ram it  down  your  Jew  throat  another  point  of 
[01:39:00]  view  just  tell her  and I  are being  very  respectful  of this  moment  and  Zeke  who is  the  fan  of  you  guys  he  wants  to  get  it  to  happen  he  just  thinks  he  just  thinks  that  this  the  heavy  moment  has  to  include  the  threat  of  physical  violence  otherwise  why  are  we  here  so  just  kind  of  as a  joke  as  the  food  sitting  there  and  there's  this  whole  moment  we're 
[01:39:30]  taking  teller  just  picks  up  a  shrimp  and  rams  it  in  his  mouth  and  he  goes  and  then  Jonesy  who  is  Welsh  and  plays  piano  all  of a  sudden  becomes  a  Tomelic  scholar  he  didn't  do  it  on  his  own  volition  teller  Bush  that  that  wasn't  actually  the  first  mouthful  and  then  he  picks  up  this  big  greasy  bacon  cheeseburger  I  mean  the  symbol  of  atheist 
[01:40:00]  America  I  mean  that  that  really  should  be  on  the  atheist  American  flag  this  big  dripping  you  know  the  way  you  really  want  a  bacon  cheeseburger  to  be  and  then  after  you've  eaten  it  the  way  you  wish  it  wasn't  you  know  exactly  I  know  that  feeling  and  he  just  picks  it  up  and  the  cheese  and  the  bacon  are  all  in  his  hands  and  he  just  takes  this  bite  and  he  goes  wow  that's  really  good  and  all 
[01:40:30]  of a  sudden  all  the  kind  of  religious  stuff  just  goes  away  he's  just  digging  the  cheeseburger  and  we  all  just  eat  and  it's  this  huge  life  changing  moment  and  I  mean  we  were  all  crying  I  mean  it  was  really  like  the  closest  you  could  get  to  some  sort  of  huge  atheist  baptism  was  he  visibly  shaken  while  he  was  doing  it  all  the  things  you  could  guess  all  the  things  you  could  guess  really  excited  no  no  no  and 
[01:41:00]  then  I  wrote  about  it  in my  book  and  used  a  different  name  for  him  and  then  over  the  past  this  two  years  ago  three  years  ago  over  the  past  three  years  he's  come  out  more  and  more  to  his  family  well  that's  why  I  wanted  you  to  tell  the  story  again  today  because  I  wanted  an  update  so  where  is  he  at  now  three  years  later  I  had  supper  with him  last  night  and it  was  great  he  sat  down  and said  I have  crab  and the  he's  ordering  for himself  now  yeah  I don't  think  a day 
[01:41:30]  celebrity  because I  listened to  your podcast  one time  and all  sudden  he's  talking  he's  doing  some  the  reason  rally  from  DC  and he's  talking  blah blah  and finally  comes up  and you're  like  should I  tell him  who you  are  and he  goes  I don't  give a  fuck  and it  was  that  guy  and I'm  like  holy  fuck  that's  the  guy  he's  actually  been  he's  become  a bit  of a  celebrity  there's  a  there's  a  real  movement  there's 
[01:42:00]  a book  that just  came  out  and I  wish  I  had  the  name  at the  top  of my  head  but it's  a woman  who has  you take  whatever it  is for a  man to  leave that  community  and you  bump it  up a  thousand  times  for a  woman  and she  just  left  the  hardcore  hasidic  community  in Brooklyn  was it  in New York  that she  did that  I think  I know  who you  mean  there's  a whole  big  thing  about  her  leaving  and she's  kind of  young  right  she's  not  that old  she's  26  that's  exactly  there was  one more  thing  about that  oh  what does  his family  think  at this  point  his family 
[01:42:30]  you know  and I  always  love this  his family  is  and this  is true  for  there's a few  exceptions  that are  terrible  but this  is true  for most  people I  know  that have  come out  as atheists  from some  sort of  fundamentalist  family  the family  understands  that they  still love  him  and it's  a theological  difference  and he  was really  kind of  shocked  and happily  shocked  that his  brother  and his  mother  and his  father  there's a  few  you know  in-laws  and stuff  that are  really  pissed  at him  but overall  they're  really  supportive  and you 
[01:43:00]  know  people tweet  me all  the time  and say  I'm about  to come  out and say  I'm an  atheist  to my  parents  what's  your  advice  and I  just  go  love  him  remember  that  the  love  has  to  transcend  that  because  if  the  love  can't  transcend  religion  then  you're  a  shitty  atheist  because  that's  all we  got  all we  got  is  each  other  all we  got  is  humanity  all we  got  is  our  life  here  and  all  we  got  is  love  so  if  you're  going  to  sell  that  out  for  atheism  you're  doing  something  besides  what I  call  atheism  that  has  to be  more  important 
[01:43:30]  I just  saw a  documentary  where a  kid  was  going  into  the  Hasidic  community  he was  raised  Catholic  but then  somehow  his  mother  was  Jewish  and  he  embraced  it  and  moved  to  Brooklyn  and  grew  the  past  it's  amazing  the  beautiful  and how  tight  knit  it is  and  the way  they help  each other  in business  and all  of this  there's so  much to  learn  about the  community  and then 
[01:44:00]  you get  all excited  about the  community  the way  women are  treated  it's horrible  all you have  to do  is go  to B&H  photo  every business  should be  run like  B&H  it's an  amazing  place  I never  get pissed  off in there  they're always  ready to help  you feel like  you learn  something  and there's  no hassle  it's so  great  it's all  in steps  okay you  picked out  your thing  now you  go over  here  now we  go over  here  now you  go to  this  everything  is nice  they're all  in form 
[01:44:30]  and they're  wearing funny  hats  which is  really  important  you know how  much more  I love doing  this show  more than  any other  show in  New York  if you guys  wore funny  hats  it would  just  go up  if I  walked in  and Norton's  got a big  black hat  like a  sombrero  and he's  chewing his  gum with  the sombrero  I was going  wow  I didn't think  it could get  better  I finally have  an answer to  a question  people come  to New York  and they go  what should  I do  where should  I go  go to  B&H  for an hour 
[01:45:00]  34th street  tonight  it's something  you just  don't see  anywhere else  all the  products  moving on  the conveyor  belt  above  your head  because they  understand  oh  whoa  if people  are stealing  our shit  we're going  to have to  raise the  prices  so they  figure that  out  with conveyor  belts above  your head  amazing  you're watching  the product  moving around  almost thievery  proof unless  it's a manager  doing it from  the back  and even then  I can  sure they  have a system  in place  and you just  know you're  being taken  care of  that's great  you don't  question anything  I went to  with a bunch  of us  that were in  various stages 
[01:45:30]  of leaving  the community  I went to  a restaurant  that's called  Trafe  that's in  Brooklyn  and we  went there  and we  were all  talking  and having  a good  time  and we  finish  and the  check  comes  and I  reach for  the check  and two  of the  people  in the  full hats  and the  payists  and the  whole  thing  say  no no  Ben  we're  paying  and BJ  the guy  you're  talking  about  who  kind of  invited  me  he said  to me  this is  the first  time  that this  has ever  happened  in Brooklyn  that two  Hassids  are pulling 
[01:46:00]  pulling  the check  away  from a  goyim  from western  Massachusetts  I mean  the worst  kind  you can  be a  non-Jew  but a  non-Jew  from western  Massachusetts  remember  in  Do the  Right  Thing  Spike Lee  when he's  walking down  the street  Spike Lee  says to  the guy  go back  to Massachusetts  that is  the most  western  Massachusetts  is the  most non-city  because you're  not south  but you're  still not  really northeast  you're wearing  a flannel shirt 
[01:46:30]  you got a beard  you're kind of  a half hippie  it's a bad  place to be  from  so you know  a Massachusetts  guy there  so these guys  are searching  you out now  I thought this  was a one  and done  but now  you're having  dinners all  over the place  once in a while  one guy came  to me  got in touch  with us  through a website  and said he  wanted me to  be the one  to cut his  pay us  wow  he wanted me  to cut his  pay us off  so I'll tell  you if there  if there is  a hell  I've just  gone past  Hitler  I'm way 
[01:47:00]  past Hitler  and we finally  have a radio  pit  let's do that  you got your  pay us  well they would  have to agree  to it obviously  we're going to  hold them down  although the old  opiate anthony  was like fuck  that agreeing  shit  we're doing  this today  let's go get  one  you've mellowed  you've mellowed out  man  we now get  we now get  at least a little  bit of permission  like maybe I  consider doing  that's enough  hold them down  opiate anthony's 
[01:47:30]  worst of 2012  hey it's eric  continuing on  with pen  gillette in studio  on the opiate anthony  show  in this segment  here he talks  about psychic  readings  and also having  to do a private  psychic reading  for a party  that steven  spielberg was  hosting  how does this  fare out  well let's  find out  if you want  to do  a real  psychic reading  the first  thing  is to get  people to  believe  there's some  way you're  doing that  you cannot  do it as  a joke  because belief  is really  part of it  then if 
[01:48:00]  you just  say things  and take  them back  they're true  for everybody  let me show  what I'm  going to do  it  anthony  yes sir  I see you  as a child  I see you  young  you're with  all the other  children  you're playing  you get along  with them  but somehow  you feel  alone  somehow  you feel  separate  you're working  hard  you're working  very hard  you're trying  to get  along with  them  and get  all your  studies  done  but there's  a part  of you  that's  holding  back  you feel  you could  be better 
[01:48:30]  you're strong  you're very  strong  you're very  strong  emotionally  but there's  a weakness  somewhere in  your heart  that you  sometimes feel  in your career  you've been  very very  ambitious  you've been  very successful  but sometimes  you worry  not as  successful  as you  could be  you're a  very tall  man  who's also  kind of  short  you're fat  but you're  also thin  you're smart  but you're  also stupid  everything you  say  just take  it back  everybody  no one  says  everything  I've done  has been  100%  successful 
[01:49:00]  every person  you've been  in love  a few times  sometimes  successfully  sometimes  not  wow  the love  of your life  may have  gotten away  but you still  feel a tenderness  that has been  fulfilled  so they're  basically fishing  and they watch  what you grab for  I haven't even  done the fishing  all I've done  is do it  and take it  back  also the other  trick  which is  horrible  is just say  what you'd like  to believe  about yourself  because the  reason poetry  works  the reason 
[01:49:30]  the show  works  is because  people have  a lot  of similarities  when Bob  Dylan sings  I married  Isis on the  fifth day  of May  but I could  not hold  on to her  very long  so I got  on my pony  and I rode  straight away  nothing happened  to you on  those dates  you didn't  get on a  pony  but there's  something  emotional  that means  something to  you and you  hold on to  it  it is a  perversion  of poetry  everyone has  shortcomings  that they  know about  and if you  talk about  that like  oh you feel  like you  could do  better 
[01:50:00]  everyone feels  they could be  in a better  situation  than they're in  no matter  who you are  then there are  other great  tricks  there are  five people  in your  family  there's five  people in  everyone's  family  because  if it's  just  you're an  only child  it's you  your mother  your father  your grandparents  were pretty  close to you  if you have  four brothers  and sisters  there's five  children in your  family  if you have  three  if you have  two brothers  and sisters  and your mother  and father  how does that work  you're only close to 
[01:50:30]  about five of them  you can always  alibi  in your head  you're like  okay  always alibi  then if you  hear these  people  you always  want to  never  ever  trust  what  they  what  you  remember  because  in the  as  Randy's fond  of saying  you don't  say  I woke  up last  night  at three  in the  morning  in a  cold  sweat  and  nothing  else  happened  and I  went  back  to bed  that's  not a  memory  you have  to have  something 
[01:51:00]  important  to remember  it  that's  the way  our mind  focuses  on stuff  so what  these  people  will  also  do  is  they'll  throw  out  a  zillion  things  and  they'll  just  watch  your  face  now  remember  nobody  is  trying  to test  them  they already  believe  it  so when  they're  talking  people  will  go  and I've  watched  videotapes  of people  that say  they told  me this  stuff  and I  said  nothing  and the  people  are  going  yeah  they're  nodding  their head  shaking  their heads  yes  so I 
[01:51:30]  see  you have  your  wife  is  a  blonde  bread  head  and they  work their  way down  on that  and then  they get  lucky  on a few  things  and that's  what the  people  and they'll  always tell  the people  I want  you to  remember  this  and be  able to  check  it  so write  this  down  then when  they hit  something  they say  write it  down  what you  want to  hear  is a  tape  recording  of those  actual  things  that's  not  edited  and then  it is  hysterical  because 
[01:52:00]  they told  you  you were  married  to people  with eight  different  days  they told  you your  grandparents  were alive  and dead  they told  you your  parents  died young  and died  old  and you  know  they'll  always  say  when  you know  that when  someone comes  to you  it's a  time of  crisis  that means  someone died  it's a  divorce  or it's  financial  you already  know that  or they  wouldn't  fucking be  there  you don't  just on a  whim  decide to  go and  get some  type of  reading  now this  is all  stuff that's  just called  cold 
[01:52:30]  that's stuff  if you  just walk  in and I  know nothing  right  there's another  thing that's a  little bit  depressing which  is we don't  really listen  to each  other  you know when  you when you  talk to  somebody you're  always especially  for us thinking  about what you're  going to say next  where you're going to  go where you're going  to go if you just  sit with someone next  time you're on a  plane with a  stranger  try this experiment  don't give any  thought to what  you're going to say  or what you want to  tell about yourself  but just say to 
[01:53:00]  yourself I'm going  to get all the  information I can  from this person as  quickly as possible  and then you look at  their hands how much  does the watch cost  what rings are they  wearing what kind of  clothes are they  wearing where are  they looking what are  their glasses what  kind of iPad do they  have what's on it  you know go through  that whole thing and  then just say you  know how are you  doing and then say  what accent do they  have you know what  music do you have with  your iPod and you'll  find if you don't  think about yourself at  all you just think  about the other  person they tell you 
[01:53:30]  everything you could  get a pretty good  line all of this is  for cold ratings that's  just someone that  walks in you know  nothing about them  now we'll go to hot  ratings which means  someone tells you my  friend Anthony is  really interested in  talking to a psychic  he's going to come in  next week I gave him  your number wow yeah  then little google a  little well you don't  even need that if you  if you know you have  a whale if that cat's  got money then you 
[01:54:00]  can afford a private  investigator no shit  now if you move to  another town okay so  you've been going to  one psychic okay and  now you're going to  move to Atlanta and  you tell your psychic I  can't go anymore to  you because I'm moving  to Atlanta do you know  a psychic down there  oh my god they say  sure I do here's the  name of a couple of  them they get on the  phone and they send  your file and your  tapes and if you've  been going to that  psychic for a year  they have reams of 
[01:54:30]  information on you  you go into Atlanta  you walk in and then  you tell all your  friends the psychic  never met me before  never even knew my  name I walked in  wow  you know and that and  that's just and then  you do it on TV right  and you can edit out you  know you can shoot all  the horseshit hours right  right edit it down to  nothing and why do  they get a pass because  their skill or whatever  their power is vague they  get these vague yeah I  see a Julie or John or 
[01:55:00]  a Jenny but why do they  get a pass on that when  if you have this skill why  would it be crystal clear  what you're seeing well  also I know I mean we  know why but why do they  get a pass on that well  I heard this this if you  want to hear a case of  someone ad-libbing really  badly John Edward I heard  this story from a this is  a secondhand story I  wasn't actually there  John Edward did one of  his shows in Atlantic  City now Atlantic City  Atlantic City remember 
[01:55:30]  that and he is on stage  in front of all these  people and he says in  Atlantic City does Greece  mean anything to anyone  Greece I'm thinking  Greece okay now big Greek  population in Jersey pretty  safe when you've got an  audience of a thousand  people that someone has  something to do with  Greece and their  ancestry and a woman  raises her hand and says  my mother just passed 
[01:56:00]  away and she loved that  movie oh that movie and  the guy is such a dipshit  he says I met the country  why wouldn't he just go  with it you would think  yeah yeah yeah because  there aren't even smart I  mean if you guys turned  into this it would be it  would be just and I saw  what you said there you  didn't say fraud you said  dipshit I'll give you an 
[01:56:30]  example of getting lucky  that's beyond belief we  used to do a thing which  was a which was a seance  where we thought that a lot  of people who were atheist  and skeptic tended to think  the people that believe  this stuff were stupid so  way back in the early 80s  before we did off Broadway  or anything Teller and I  would be hired for private  parties of all skeptics and  we would say we are fakes we  are frauds total bullshit but  from here on we're going to  pretend we're not and we're 
[01:57:00]  going to do a full-blown seance  with table rattling and the  whole thing and people would  think it was going to be this  funny little arc and we  would scare the living shit  out of people wow really we  stopped doing it in about  84 85 we hit off Broadway and  in about 1990 Spielberg had  heard about the seances and  that only you know the fewer  than 100 people had seen  them and that we had stopped  doing them and all he wanted  from his friends Mitch 
[01:57:30]  Spielberg right yeah for a  bachelor party was for Penn  Teller to do the seance for 12  of his friends and it was like  you know Harrison Ford and  Dustin Hoffman so we flew out  we took a night off from our  Broadway show and flew out to  do this seance we hadn't done  in five or six years and one  part of it that was just  horrendous and just freaked  people out now we tell them  about it's fake but once we  start going we've said if  anybody says anything about  being fake after we start we 
[01:58:00]  just leave it's just done it's  just over so you pretend you  believe for this amount of  time you know and don't bust  us and there's your perfume  from there and holding hands  and all of this and we did  this one section that was so  creepy where we had these  pictures of atrocities and  sexual perversions that we had  gotten that we'd hand out all  around just or Jimmy's hard  drive as we call it really  creepy unpleasant shit we handed  around about 20 pictures and we  asked each person to pick a 
[01:58:30]  picture that that gave them the  strongest reaction which is  also really uncomfortable in  front of people you know to say  here you know the picture of  this guy's face being blown off  you know that's what I'll take  and then we would gather those  up right and we would shuffle  them up and we would pick one  and put it down there and then  we would take some blood and put  it in a petri dish you know and  run it over a slate and this very  mystical wording would appear 
[01:59:00]  writing and then we would sit  there for 10 minutes with these  people going wonder what that  means you know we had to pretend  we didn't know what it meant and  they would all sit around  figuring if someone would finally  figure out that it meant  Deuteronomy and a chapter and  verse and they'd run and get a  Bible and there in that chapter  and verse in the Bible was the  exact description of the atrocity  we were looking at and it was  just blood-curdling and this  whole trick you know this kind  of magic that intimate close 
[01:59:30]  magic is very slow you know you  want a two-minute act in a live  show but sitting around with 12  people you can go 25 minutes on  this creepy thing and it comes out  now we go we rehearse this and  there is a move you do you collect  the 12 collected selected pictures  of the many and then we're  shuffling them and going through  them and the hero one the one we  want is is marked and then teller's  doing a move and I'm doing a move 
[02:00:00]  we end up forcing the picture we're  going to do right forcing there's a  trick serious tricks without  pictures chosen then there's a way  to get the thing on the on the slate  so we're prepared to do that right  so we get there we lay the pictures  out and Spielberg goes I want this  one and you're not taking it out of  my hand I want this one because he  knows there's a trick coming oh he  grabs one and says I want this one  no way out we are belly up dead in  the water floating that he turns the 
[02:00:30]  picture oh and he's holding the hero  he is now holding we now have six  minutes of work that we do not have to  do right he is just wow it's just pure  dumb luck and he didn't even pick the  one that grabbed him he picked the one  you know that was random just to fuck  with us he didn't even look at it I want  this one and his hands gripped on it I  won't basically saying I'll show them I 
[02:01:00]  won't let go of it he's holding it  that's great and I you know because I'm  not as much of a professional as I  should be I made eye contact with  teller for a second which I never  should have done and teller just goes  so I say to Spielberg no no look at all  of them do you want to change your mind  oh wow and he goes no and I go really  really look at all of them really look  at all of them do you want to change  your mind no and he holds it and I go 
[02:01:30]  okay let's get some blood and try this  I'm sorry I don't I don't know if this  will work you might have screwed us up  you might have screwed us up you know  you know might have screwed us up and we  go through that and the writing comes  out and and they go to the Bible it  describes it exactly and everyone at the  table I mean actually gets like a little  woozy oh wow I say to them afterwards 
[02:02:00]  which is so funny afterwards I say I want  you all to remember exactly what happened  here and every single magician you meet  you tell them what happened and ask them  how we did it  you just ask them now if you're doing  magic all the time if you're doing  tricks all the time that's going to  happen that's going to happen if you  have an asshole that reaches into a deck 
[02:02:30]  and just pulls one out you don't see it  you're not you haven't picked it out you  haven't done anything and says tell me  what this card is and you say seven of  diamonds you know more than once in a  hundred times you're going to be right  yeah this is will be an anthony's  worst of 2012 worst of 2012 will be an  anthony show my name is he rock in this  segment here Jim tells the story which  we later dub superhero Jimmy where Jimmy  follows a bus that he thinks is being  stolen throughout the streets of 
[02:03:00]  Manhattan when he calls 9-1-1 do they  help it's superhero Jimmy this is ONA's  worst of 2012 on the opiate anthony  channel I followed a bus last night and  with the with the call police 9-1-1 sign  huh well what happened I was driving home  and I was behind a bus yeah I saw a sign  you know like the bus has an automatic  sign oh yeah yeah 9-1-1 call police  police 9-1-1 oh yeah when they when the  driver's having an emergency or something  you know where the bus is stolen yeah so 
[02:03:30]  I'm fucking following this bus you were  following a bus on my way home I call 9-1-1  Newman and I say look I'm following this  bus it's going 10th 10th Avenue  northbound and the 9-1-1 operators are  fucking what kind of bus it was a big city  it was an MTA bus a double like two  buses together and Jimmy is a crime  fighter Jimmy I was fighting Jimmy I  didn't know what was happening there  could have been hostages I mean we all  saw that Keanu Reeves movie right yes  yes but I'm following it it makes we're 
[02:04:00]  going 10th northbound and like from the  40s and then it starts to make a left on  57th so I follow it to 57th I'm on the  phone with 9-1-1 right I'm going and this  fucking dummy is where are you now I said  I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th  Avenue okay you're on now where are you  now I said 48th Street oh Jesus where are  you now 49th Street let's use which way  are you going I'm like I'm on 10th Avenue  northbound the only way you can go is so  irritated oh my god so we make the left  on 57th Street we go down to 11th Avenue 
[02:04:30]  I go look he's making a left on 11th  Avenue did you do a pit maneuver that's  where you hit him on the rear and spin  him around no no I casually followed down  11th Avenue and we had to pass I'm out  the window casually and we get down into  like the high 40s and as I'm on the  phone I'm like we're now southbound on  11th Avenue is this a dream no it's  happened you really did so did you hit  him with your lights I fucking we're  past the cop who was sitting there and I'm 
[02:05:00]  like we're passing a cop right now and  this call police call police 911 is  flashing on the fucking thing that's  lost his mind I love this but I didn't  know what it was going on I thought it  was a stolen bus so then it's coming up  wait can I ask you where you were going  that you then stopped going there to  following home okay so then I'm  southbound on 11th by the way that  means he's not going home anymore oh  no I'm going southbound yeah now he's  now he's following the bus I'll take  the phone daddy if you want to drive 
[02:05:30]  what would you have done if all of a  sudden they'd hang out the window  start firing at you like fucking 48  hours Gans and Billy Bear is shooting  up the window at you well I get down to  40s you've gotten the hint at that point  well I yeah I probably would have I get  the 40s and it's a yellow light so the  bus slows down shoots through the light  whoa and leaves me at the red light why  didn't you go through it because I knew  that the bus did that on purpose I'm  like this guy knows I'm behind him so 
[02:06:00]  because I also he got stuck at the next  light oh he got stuck at the next light  so I'm off the phone with 911 already and  now we're going southbound again so I  called back we get we've stuck on  southbound on 11th Avenue and like I've  never seen a bus go down this way so I'm  like this is weird territory 11th Avenue  past the Lincoln Tunnel all the way  down to 34th Street and then the bus  drives a little erratically and then  hangs a sharp right on 34th Street  towards the West Side Highway so I call  again 9-1-1 I'm like look I just 
[02:06:30]  called you fucking people I'm behind a  stolen bus this guy you know what is  doing how long does it take to get a  squad car and fucking 11th Avenue so  we Jimmy's calling for backup and he  can't call me for backup you think the  bus is on with 9-1-1-2-0 yeah yeah  someone's following me I'm trying to get  away from him I'm just trying to lose  some guy with a tall black girl with a  blonde wig following me  Jimmy Norton get your ass in my office  you're just that renegade fucking lone 
[02:07:00]  wolf cop yeah me and my partner  calling for  get too old for this shit so I fucking get  down to 34th and we're getting down to  the West Side Highway right before the  West Side Highway and his car is at the  light and the bus slows down a lot  uh-oh uh-oh will you get nervous now  no I knew what he was doing I knew he  knew I was behind him so I pull up on  the side but not because it's such a  long bus the driver was still ahead of  me and I'm like look he's gonna make a  right on the West Side Highway so the  bus makes a right on the West Side 
[02:07:30]  Highway I jump behind him and he slows  to a crawl oh shit on the West Side  Highway and I'm on the phone with the  person like he's stopping on the  fucking West Side Highway and I was  finally just got annoyed because I  could see that it was pitch black on  the bus there was it was like there  was no people on the bus it was  probably just a stolen bus it wasn't  like there was people so I pull up  next to it and it's really dark on the  bus and I look up and I just see some  there's a black dude I'm on the phone  I'm like I'm looking at the guy oh man  and he's just a black dude he's  dressed in uh but he's not dressed 
[02:08:00]  like a bus driver and he's looking out  at me and I know that he's just he's  stealing this bus oh and then I  do with a stolen that's what I'm  saying that's what I don't know so  then I was just like fuck this shit  and I drive away and he pulls away  slowly and starts to drive and I'm  like you know what I'm northbound now  and he's behind me and he's like  what street I'm like we're in the 30s  because the woman was like where was  he before I'm like well he was on 10th  and 11th and she goes well those  streets run parallel to each other I'm  like I know he fucking turned down one  oh my god 911 operators are fucking 
[02:08:30]  dumb yeah I know they're parallel  stupid what do you think he didn't  turn did he tell you uh did he  order you to stop following did she  order you to stop following but you  continued well then the bus turned  off at some weird a very quick turn  off in the high 30s um and then I was  like you know what he turned off he  turned off I'm not following him  anymore oh we lost him and they're  probably like thank god and he  probably turned into the bus depot  boy would I love to hear that 911 
[02:09:00]  recording yeah I gave my name and  everything oh but then I'm like what  the fuck are the cops doing but I'm  like I guess even if it was a joyride  in a bus that's not a high priority in  New York City I think it should be I  do too probably should slam that shit  into anything yeah so what happens I  just drove home I mean that was it  happens now though was there a stolen  bus now I need to know I don't know but  I mean I can't believe you just gave  up that I gave up I tell you why I  got crime-fighting Jimmy so close to  being a crime-fighter I had my fucking my 
[02:09:30]  little hand recorder with me I  should have taped it and put the  stuff on speaker but I wasn't  thinking in that moment I just wasn't  just thinking about saving people  lives yeah yeah so after you gave up  on the bus did you pull over get a  hooker have sex in the car and then  beat the shit out of her with a  baseball bat and take back your money  no I was a Grand Theft Auto it sounds  like you were playing GTA last no no  but I had an appointment waiting for me  at home I love this one Jim Norton  apathetic crime-fighter you were a  crime-fighter right up until you just 
[02:10:00]  couldn't fucking take the inconvenience  until I realized I was going to be  late for my appointment that was  meaning to be at home priorities  changed drastically exactly oh that's  funny I had to be somewhere what the  fuck Jimmy I would have kept falling  but I just got so irritated up right  next to the guy I wanted to see I  wanted to see him what if you had a  fucking a shooter oh I thought of  that but I'm like he's not gonna start  firing out the window he's just not I  knew it would oh but it was it was  definitely something shady because of  the way the bus was driving now do not 
[02:10:30]  know Wow but it was I gave the  license plate can we look this up  somehow online bus I don't know I  don't know how to either we call the  MTA we got a lot of cop friends yeah  it was a double bus was there an issue  last night that Jimmy was part of sort  of I'll tell you what time I called he  was almost part of this I'll tell you  what he almost did the right right up  until he just couldn't be bothered I  just got annoyed that was why I stopped  because the operators are so fucking  dumb when I said to her anyway she's  like where was he before who give 
[02:11:00]  first of all who gives a fuck right I'm  like he was on 10th and then 11th and  she was well they're parallel like I  know he was straddling them you cunt one  giant wheel one giant wheel he was going  over the buildings asshole I know what  if the guy just didn't realize his sign  was on you know the nine that's  absolutely a possibility he just hit it  with his knee 10th Avenue North 10th Avenue  all of a sudden a left on 57th Street  and then southbound on 11th but he was  erratic all the way down to fucking 
[02:11:30]  34th makes a right on 31st goes all the  way north on West Side Highway slows down  sees me I pull ahead then peel absolutely  not I thought of that it could have been  a mistake maybe the bus driver pulled  into some kind of depot and said hey man  my stupid lights on yeah I'll fix this  all right I'll you know what I'll take it  for a spin and try to figure it out for  you yeah could you please fix this light  some guys following me I called at 9 9 32 and  then 9 39 again so I followed the bus for  like eight minutes damn eight minutes of  crime fighting yeah that's fantastic 
[02:12:00]  Jimmy well you're committed I wish I would  have fucking filmed you could have felt  heard the call oh yeah yeah the calls I'm  sure do you get more irritated as the  call goes on because I'd love to hear you  just going he's right here and that would  have been your viral video oh my god I was  saying dumb trick shot basketball thing that I  did oh I just fucking filming yourself as  you're talking to 9-1-1 following a bus  fantastic I just didn't think of it no  problem I just didn't think no problem but  it was so it was so irritating because I 
[02:12:30]  really thought a crime was being committed  and I thought I had to do some solicitation  Jimmy really wears a lot of hats oh he  does he wants to do the right thing  sometimes you are a crime fighter I love  it you're like a vigilante yeah a  vigilante you're taking care of this city  I should have Kersey yeah you're you're  gonna turn it to Paul Kersey Paul Kersey  I'm following a bus yeah you know he got  bit by the bugs and now this is gonna be  his whole thing he's just gonna go on 
[02:13:00]  patrol in the middle of night he's gonna  become a superhero on patrol stopping  buses excuse me what kind of license to be  driving this sir what kind of superhero do  you want to be do you want to be like  Batman we don't have any real special  powers but you got great gadgets that's  kind of good or do you want to be like I  don't know like Superman or I want to be  one shit that stops women who are  smuggling meaty vaginas I want to stop  this infiltration of this nation by of  meaty vaginas by searching all these  women and weeding out their giant 
[02:13:30]  clitorises I know I know Ronnie B is a  hero almost every day but we almost had a  hero today yeah Jim was almost a hero  Jim's motto is with great power comes a  little bit of responsibility as much as I  really want to put into it yeah I don't  know where he was going the best is like  we're just talking about the Yankees  and out of nowhere he's like fucking  cry fighter Jimmy yeah just cry fighter  Jimmy I almost forgot I wrote down follow  bus oh you should you should have had some 
[02:14:00]  of future Jimmy's gadgets you could have  gotten them that way could have  communicated through your head internet  yeah yes in the future we will just  touch the back of the bus and it will be  home wow that is really fun oh that's  fan-fucking-tastic yeah I wish I had done  what that is right there well the word  has uh there's people begging for an  animation of this oh my god oh my god  that'd be so I could just picture it I  just gave up though  that's the best part the second it got a 
[02:14:30]  little too inconvenient and did it get  tuckered out I was annoyed and I really  had to be home yeah I had a young lady  friend meeting me oh my god they're  calling you slouch man  we need this on a record so you can just  not a fade out it doesn't work 
[02:15:00]  he almost gets motivated yeah he is  almost there oh my god that guy stole  that fucking bus I will listen to the  replay today and I rarely do just to hear  that oh yeah it just came out of  nowhere I'm like what the fuck's going  on I'm looking at it what what is  fantastic what happened I just love the  non-committal the whole fucking just you  put in all the work why would you stop at  that point you're there you're in the 
[02:15:30]  middle of I know I just got so annoyed  with the fat with their apathy and  their inability because the 911  operators I'm following the bus is like  all right thank you and I'm like why  would you get I'm like why don't you I  just stay on the phone with you and let  you and give you an update to where he  was going like I just didn't like the  way they handled it but dumb you had  here a citizen yes willing to be on the  phone she could have called the squad  car a good citizen is following  northbound you I bet you you just 
[02:16:00]  pictured what it's like in the movies  like somebody does that instantly like  five cop cars come swooping in you're  part of the big chase like you're  watching it like yeah all right yeah  left on the tent here we go we're going  to West Side Highway he's going very  slow and then all of a sudden like  fucking cops are swarming you're part of  the chase they're saluting you through  their fucking windows yeah and it's not  every day an ordinary citizen does right  well speaking of her honor brings me in 
[02:16:30]  to the mayor Frank Carr in Jersey if  there's trouble Bloomberg shines a big  light with the picture of a  transgender person into the sky it's  just this female form of long hair and a  big silhouette of a cock Jimmy looks up  it goes oh I would not respond well to  that I bet you there was a big  misunderstanding there I bet you the  light was on I bet you that happens a  lot some maintenance guys like all right  I got a fucking I have to actually drive  the bus to figure it out I don't know and  then all of a sudden sees this car  fucking following him yeah what the fuck 
[02:17:00]  is this car following me I'm gonna take a  ride yeah I think he might be oh my god  and then he gets pissed because that's  why he slows all the way down like can I  fucking help you I'm trying to do my job  here sir oh Jimmy maybe it was a  maintenance man maybe it was but he  looked too shady man but because I  don't know where you would bring one  of these buses after you have your  little fun with the joyride I don't  know yeah what what possible motive  could you have for stealing a double  one of those double city buses I don't  think you can bring it to some fucking 
[02:17:30]  pawn shop shop yeah pawn shop or  something maybe it's a big garage at  home he wants to park it what what would  you do with it you can't melt it down  for the precious metal and a joyride is  just well obviously it is good to take  a joyride because no cops are gonna  stop you if somebody calls 9-1-1  maybe he was just practicing oh yeah  maybe the fucking button was broken I  think I think there's probably a very  simple answer here tonight on wildest  police chases oh man a man with 
[02:18:00]  erection difficulties follows a  maintenance worker for nine minutes no  one gives a shit now they're calling you  captain try a little oh my god I love  it yeah that was not yeah there you go  yeah so he gave pursuit yeah I just love 
[02:18:30]  how it came out of nowhere yeah I just  and went nowhere it's great you just gave  up I just went home I'm calling off the  pursuit I just went home and did things  that would bother a lot of religious  people oh it's too late hold on it's not  it's just what you want it yeah I just  want to hear it this is Jimmy's theme  music as a crime fighter in a big city  oh man he's pursuing there he is  yeah he's on the phone 
[02:19:00]  oh he's committed  you know what it's not too late  that sums up Jimmy  oh that's so good just what is getting  good there's so much energy to that and 
[02:19:30]  things are gonna get fixed and evil will  not prevail and see it's all about the  timing oh that's fantastic yeah fuck it  oh one more time it was perfect oh yeah  you can just picture how it how it  progressed yeah here's Jimmy I gotta do  something what is that looks like this  bus was stolen wait a minute there's  this could be a crime going on I'll take  this I've got it  oh now he's in hot pursuit Jimmy in hot 
[02:20:00]  pursuit  and I go home  this is ONA's worst of 2012 on the OPN  to the channel so Jim Norton you know  the reality is with this show that  there's a lot of people right now that  don't know what happened yesterday on  the show  but Jimmy so we got to set this up  before we play the the piece audio we 
[02:20:30]  got  well I was driving home a couple  nights ago and I was behind a bus on  10th Avenue northbound which is how I  tend to describe it  oh no when I'm calling 9-1-1  Jimmy did Jimmy did the movie version of  what he felt he should do in this  situation the audio is okay I mean  it's better than okay  but I the point is you thought it was a 
[02:21:00]  stolen bus you followed it for about  eight minutes and then after eight  minutes you couldn't be bothered  anymore well I followed it and then I  called back I just to call because the  first time I was I thought they were  going to do something and I followed it  north then I followed it I followed it  north west south west and then north  again so it was a double bus that  apparently that that that not that  thing on the fucking double bus  motherfucker  so I'm and then I called back and they  just I thought it should have gotten a  greater amount of attention yeah all 
[02:21:30]  right well here's the 9-1-1 call from  superhero Jimmy yeah it's okay it's good  for about eight minutes fighting crime  this is all this is a short call though  9-1-1 what is the emergency I'm on 10th  Avenue northbound and I'm behind the bus  and the sign says call cops 9-1-1 on the  bus it's bus number 5610 we're on 10th  Avenue and it's crossing 47th Street  okay so you said it's 10th Avenue and 
[02:22:00]  it's crossing what 47th we're no we're  northbound and now we're crossing 48 I'm  right behind this bus but that that  automatic sign  okay so it says west I'm sorry I'm just  trying to get there you said it's 10th  Avenue and west 47th Street yes and now  I'm at 49th we're northbound  northbound  is it an NTA bus  uh yes it is bus number 5610  oh five six or one or zero or five or 
[02:22:30]  six one zero yes sir yes sir  oh my god volunteering information yes I  am very happy oh my god doing my civic  duty  zero oh and you said it's heading which way  sir northbound the only way you can go on  10th Avenue and now it's about to make a  left we're on 10th making a up hold on 
[02:23:00]  still going straight here okay still going  5th Street yeah it looks like it's going to  make a left on 57th Street  on 57th Street yep it's a double bus just  made a left on 57th Street oh she doesn't  care no one she just doesn't care no one  cares about this she doesn't care like why  is my time being wasted by this wannabe crime fighter oh god yes there he is uh yeah bus 
[02:23:30]  six five niner niner three  make sure  yes I'm in pursuit  I need backup though  I need you  to send a system  eh I got him going home 
[02:24:00]  I'm tired  you turn  you turn  you turn  it's one of those double  decker buses correct  no it's a double bus  why  I love  how annoyed you are  you're trying to be cool because you're  fighting crime right now  oh boy  but you're getting so annoyed because  she's getting everything wrong  yeah which way on 10th Avenue  there's only one way still  you told her look 10th Avenue it only  goes one way and now you're like  no it's not a double  decker I told you already it's not a  it's just a double bus yeah 
[02:24:30]  a double bus is different than a double  decker  decker buses correct  no it's a double bus  one after the other  one after the other okay  and we're headed towards 11th Avenue  and it says call 9-1-1  yes call cops call 9-1-1  no I'm just getting the information  oh yeah no I know  one shit at a time  I'm getting the information  no she says I was getting irritated  thank you nice lady  maybe because she's not writing anything  down or whatever  she stinks  you gotta repeat everything to her 
[02:25:00]  I'm in high speed pursuit  making a left on 57th  this is Sheriff Jim T. North  Jim T. Cell  I know  I know it sounds repetitive  I'm just getting all the answers  and now I'm making a left  on 11th Avenue  southbound  still behind this bus  alright so what is your name  James Norton 
[02:25:30]  N-O-R-T-O-N  oh  James Norton  November  Oscar  oh my god  oh god  I know  it was very official  very official  Jimmy's just a nice guy in the end  he always tries to do the right thing  he's trying to be helpful  alright sir  assistance will be there as soon as possible  thank you so much for calling  I'm southbound on 11th right now  pulling up 
[02:26:00]  55th street  do you want to stay on  she's passing a cop right now  who's parked for a fire  I mean  because of  the last course  that you just passed by now  what is that on  11th  stop what you're doing  if she wants me off  this fucking course  of course she does  I guess she's not allowed to hang up on you  for whatever reason  leave us with a light on  it's embarrassing  they said  maybe I should just stay on with you  like I'd be giving directions to the cops 
[02:26:30]  until they cut them off  of course you would  I'm a cunt  you're giving suggestions to the police officers  if you cut up 57th  you could head them off at the pass  I love this  I'm calling you super scallop  thank you so much for calling  oh  oh no  that's call one  how'd you feel at that point  irritated that I didn't feel  I was like  she wasn't taking you seriously  yeah I'll probably take a cop 
[02:27:00]  a minute or two  that's cut down  that was a much longer call  with pauses and shit  but I think I will get the cops here shortly  and I followed him for  a total of about 8 or 9 minutes  I kept following  oh god  we went all the way down 11th  this is after we went down 11th  and then we made a right on  34th  and uh  he had lost me in a light  and then that was when  he was slowing down  before hitting the red light  like I knew he knew I was behind him  and before we made the run  on the west side highway  so uh 
[02:27:30]  you called back  cause  you still don't see the cops  yes  pursuing the bus  so Jimmy called 911 again  no  always  emergency  hi  I just called  and no one's doing anything  I just called  and no one's doing anything  there's a crime being committed  do you understand  what I'm trying to tell you people  it's like  he's seeing a murder happen  and there's no help coming 
[02:28:00]  yeah  concerned Jimmy  Jimmy's so disappointed  8 minutes  8 minutes of utmost concern  no one's taking me seriously  no one's doing anything  no one's doing anything  for Pete's sake  for Pete's sake  no  always  emergency  hi  I'm on  I just called  and no one's doing anything  I'm following a stolen bus  I think  enough about the bus  he figured he'd make it sound  more important  not just  there's a bus with a light on  now it's like  it's a stolen bus 
[02:28:30]  I think  I think  I'm following a stolen bus  I'm in pursuit  of a stolen bus  I'm glad I didn't mention  any hostages  oh god  it says call cops  I'm northbound  on the west side highway now  westbound on the north side highway  where were you before  when you called  who cares  on 10th Avenue  and 11th Avenue  it's a double bus  and it's northbound  on the west side highway  by what street  is across and over  34th Street 
[02:29:00]  we just passed over  34th Street  I think he knows  I'm right behind him  but there's no cops  doing anything  I think he knows  that I'm following him  because I think it's a  yes  it looks like a stolen bus  how did you make  that assumption  Jimmy how did you make  the assumption  are you qualified  to say that  I am yes  I just think it's a stolen bus  it looks stolen  because of the way  he was driving  I felt he was driving  a little erratically  and I also  that big sign  on the back  was flashing  did you feel  because it was  an African American  gentleman driving 
[02:29:30]  that that made you  think it was stolen  more so than if  it had been  a white gentleman  no I didn't  if he would have  had a uniform on  I would not have  thought that  but it was pitch black  in the bus  there was no internal  light on  you never see it  that dark in the bus  oh boy  there was something  shady going on  oh boy  dark shady  I'm hearing catchphrases  keywords  I like how you paused  you said  it looks like  yeah  it's a stolen bus  upon further  investigation  it's a stolen bus  yes  I think we have 
[02:30:00]  a 836  in progress  jeez Timmy  this is great  I was helping  you were helping  you are adorable  the call cops thing  is on  but no one is  doing anything about it  so he's northbound now  and he's almost  stopped driving  because he knew  I was following him  what's the bus number  I already gave  I don't remember  I just passed him  I'm sick of following  him and no cops  are coming  I've been following  for 10 minutes  but now we're 
[02:30:30]  passing 40th street  but before when you  called  what's the street  you gave  10th and 11th  but then he came down  11th and now  we went up 10th  he's probably  going to turn it off  because you're  going to lose him  but I can't believe  they can't get a  squad car in Manhattan  follow the fucking guy  now you're cursing  squad car  there's a lot going on  here though  because she  she doesn't know  about the prior call  for whatever reason  if you're a 911  operator in New York City  wouldn't some of that  shit be popping up 
[02:31:00]  on the screen  so they could  cross reference it  as funny as this is  obviously  there is some  fucked up shit in here  and who cares  where I was before  of course  did he start  throwing JFK's  golf clubs  at your car  I know that one  I know he was on  10th and then he  went down 11th  on what street 
[02:31:30]  now he just went  back up north  oh my god  but now right now  he just turned it  off  forget it  you know what  he just turned it  off  he just turned it  off  and that's it  forget it  forget it  you finally had it  yeah  that's how dumb  they are  yeah  well yes  but I mean  they probably heard  that and just said  who gives a shit  where were you  before  who gives a fuck  I'm here  I'm on 34th  and Westside Highway  send the police  what they're probably  not telling you  they made a quick 
[02:32:00]  call  and they went  no that's  that's our guy  in that box  that's Reggie  they don't even  care  do you understand  though Jimmy  it was very important  to you  I understand  you were making  the call  you wanted  some kind  of result  that was the  same service  that was called  when people said  there's a plane  crashing into a  building  you know  a real emergency  I know  I'm surprised  they didn't say  what was the  longitude and latitude  of the plane  as it was coming in  what kind of plane 
[02:32:30]  was it  how many people  are in first class  and how many  were upgrades  that's probably  the type of  questions they asked  on 9-11  those asshole  fucking operators  I love  official Jimmy  I'm fucking  they both annoyed  me so much  people are so  uncomfortable  they're just  writing  oh god  hang up already  Jesus  it is  it's so  uncomfortable  is it uncomfortable  oh yeah  you're trying to  do the right thing  kudos to whoever  fucking found that  and sent it in 
[02:33:00]  because that's  just amazing  that we talked  about that yesterday  and we got it  and we got the call  trying to do the  right thing  and no one cares  I just want to be  helpful  you certainly did  you're a crime  fighter Jimmy  I'm a helpful boy  you are  I'm a good citizen  you really are  and it's because  of people like him  who help the police  yes  yo Pat  hey what's going  guys  you're sending  the call  thank you  yeah no problem  I sent the new  Jimmy's email  yeah  how did you  how did you  get the call  I work for the department 
[02:33:30]  so I have access  to some of that stuff  were you laughing  when you found it  and listened to it  yeah you know  I have to listen  on the radio  when I got the call  the second call  especially when  you get so pissed off  I was dying laughing  at work  that's great  how come nobody  was leaping into action  I used to work  over there man  they hear those calls  all the time  they don't really  bother with that crap  they get to the corner  the bus is gone  and they just say  alright  you know  unfounded  or whatever  yeah we're on it  yeah  go about your business  we're on it  don't worry  basically there's 
[02:34:00]  more important  things to do  yeah exactly  definitely  they didn't want  to stay on the phone  with me while the police  chased him down  while I gave locations  chased him down  was that your dream  Jimmy  I love the fact  you'd be on the phone  a little danger  a little danger  but you'd back off  a little  and then the cops  would come flying in  from the side  maybe crash into the bus  to stop it  he's bound on 50th  crossing over 7th Avenue  southbound  little Jimmy's out there  and afterwards 
[02:34:30]  he's got a medal  pinned on him  at City Hall  one of the cops  just got me out there  and I'm parked  guys they're cuffing him  and I just thought  well what happened was  I was on my way home  they're thanking you  what's that  Jimmy can star  in Speed 3  yeah following  Speed 3  he follows a bus  on his way  to the maintenance garage  well thank you for sending man  that was a great grab  yeah absolutely  no problem guys  thanks man  take care Pat  I just didn't want  to take his call  because I didn't want  to get him in trouble  get him in trouble  first year moments  for the past 12 months 
[02:35:00]  all being Anthony's  worst of 2012  continues  worst of 2012  Obi and Anthony show  my name is E-Rock  in this segment  we're continuing  something that happened  I think back in 2011  maybe even 2010  when Jim Florentine  was on the show  and he told the story  about going to  Madison Square Garden  and was a big wrestling fan  back in the day  met up with this creepy dude  who would give him  exclusive rare wrestling photos  that this guy took  in order for him 
[02:35:30]  to fondle Jim  maybe nuzzle his ear  and a couple other  little things here and there  well now  in this segment here  well now we're going to  find out what this guy  looks like  Jim's bringing in his  book of photos  so we can see all the photos  that he said he earned  and continue on  with the back history  of the wrestling pedophilia  photography dude  with Jim Florentine's  wrestling photos  it's a whole thing  you gotta listen to it  this is Opie Anthony's  worst of 2012  Jim Florentine in studio 
[02:36:00]  you'll hear it  playing the brokerage  epic one man show  I'm Your Savior  8 o'clock show  it's supposed to me  I should go to that one  right  go and  you get to see  the wrestling pictures  I know  I want to see that  you got a  stand the man  stasiak  and  Freddie Blassie  bleeding  oh please  love Freddie Blassie  your asshole  bleeding  whatever  superstar Billy Graham  yeah  sounds fun man  yeah  I got a picture 
[02:36:30]  of the actual guy  that molested me  he was on a sex  offender's website  so I have that picture  too  oh really  can we see it here  today  does he look like  the typical child toucher  he kind of does  kid toucher  yeah  yeah you know what  I could probably do it  yeah let me  I'll write  his name down  oh nice  some  because you know  when I told the story  on the air here  about 30 people  emailed me and said  this guy did this to me too  wow  so and then we found  the guy's like  I think it was this guy's name  and then he showed me the picture  I'm like yep that's him 
[02:37:00]  so he was like a  Sandusky type character  yeah  that's him  that's his picture  yeah  that's him on a sex  offender's website  that's the guy  that molested you  yeah  he got caught huh  yeah  that's like Mike Ditka  did he give you a Bears ticket  he does look like Ditka  jerk you off for a  fucking refrigerator  periode riff  yeah he does look like Ditka  oh wow  but just since around 94  he was on a sex offender's website  this happened probably  79 when he did  yeah  so he got 15 good years in  that's a good career 
[02:37:30]  yeah  that's a good career  15 years of  he lost some weight  is he in the Hall of Fame  he should be  should be in the Hall of Fame  for kid touching  damn  yeah I mean he  you know  he put up numbers huh  there was a lot of  a lot of kids  a lot of people got in touch  with me after that  I told that story  this one kid  said that he lived in  he lived in Jersey  like North Jersey  and he  this guy convinced  his parents  he was like 10  no maybe 12  to come into New York City  because there's a wrestling match 
[02:38:00]  the next night  like a Saturday night  so his parents  drove him into New York  and dropped him off  at this guy's apartment  and he stayed over  at his house  to go to the wrestling match  with him the next day  back then they didn't talk  about it as much  adults were more trusted  25 years ago  don't fucking parents  and then  he was all over him  he's grabbing him  and stuff like that  and he's fighting him off  the whole time  and he just started crying  in the corner  so the guy just left him alone  went to sleep  he slept on the couch  and in the morning  he goes  the wrestling match got cancelled  tell your parents  come pick you up 
[02:38:30]  you didn't give me anything  fuck you  the match got cancelled  he's not wasting  a good wrestling match  on him  it's pay or play  yeah he had  he had someone else  lined up  pay or play  is that kid fucked up  nowadays  I don't know  he emailed me a story  and told me it  I'm not sure  now being a father  could you even imagine  allowing your 10 year old  to go to the city  and stay overnight  he's going to take  a wrestling match  I can't even find a babysitter  so I can leave the house 
[02:39:00]  for 3 hours  I don't even trust  for 3 hours  imagine a whole night  in the city  overnight  get the fuck out of here  when my sister babysits  my kid  I check his ass  and she's done  to make sure  nothing was in there  this is only  age worst of 2012  hey where's this picture  it's an ale  oh yeah  so you gotta explain again  this is a legendary story  at this point  alright well yeah  when I was 14  this guy used to molest me  for wrestling pictures  see I wasn't Joe Piscopo 
[02:39:30]  it wasn't a big set up  I went to Madison Square Garden  I was getting out of the cab  and the door was locked  and then I got out of the cab  and look who was there  none other than  the wrestling molester guy  and we're friends  his name was Barry  but I called him Bear  how far did he get with you  well he grabbed my penis  at one point  but I used to just  I sat on his lap  I wanted a mattress  because he was in the front  and he nibbled on my ear  well that's not as bad 
[02:40:00]  as what we heard yesterday  Ralphie May got tagged  really  yeah he told us yesterday  he got tagged  yeah he got tagged  to the point where  he had to go to the hospital  and then the guy got arrested  and then the guy got killed  in prison  his neighbor  he got tagged  in his asshole  Ralphie May got  Ralphie was 8  Ralphie was a goer  yeah  Ralphie was 8  he was a fucking goer  wow  yeah exactly  yeah I mean  he'll just like  brush my helmet  and I woke up  and I pushed him off  and I gave him  you know  I would give him  a kiss on the cheek  and he would give me  a picture  aww 
[02:40:30]  that was our little thing  a kiss on the cheek  nothing else  what a creep  it would be less creepy  if he jammed his dick  in your ass  than a kiss  well he would say  because he would lure me  he's like you know  we haven't seen each other  in a while  give me a kiss  aww  sweet  and then when I would do it  on one cheek  because he would show me  you want this picture  of Ivan Koloff  yeah well just give me a kiss  I have to say this  I think Florentine's  the only person alive  that wasn't affected  by a molestation  nah  nah  right  you just weren't affected  by it  you look at the positives 
[02:41:00]  I got these  I still got these pictures  I got some good memories  and I've been  it's a big part  of my one man show  so yeah  that's traumatic  for most people  but I just feel like  it's not traumatic  for you  oh look  it's called  my molestation  yeah  oh look  he even wrote  this is how dumb Jim is  it's a grey book  and in grey  he writes  wrestling picture album  hey yeah  who the fuck  can read that  you can't even read it  it's in grey  what's it written in  I don't know  like some black

[02:44:30]  what a despicable man  Jesus  yeah  did you feel his whiskers  well yeah  yeah  because he was  he was very thin  in that picture  yeah I was going to say  he wasn't that fat  yeah no  the guy that I met  you know  this must have been  an early picture of him  oh that's definitely him  but yeah that's him  there's some people here  on the cam  yeah that's  that guy is  is he still around  wow  I forget  I don't know  I think he's dead  you think  okay  yeah he'd be in his 70's  well I have a picture  of him on a sex offenders  website that I use  in my one man show 
[02:45:00]  really  yeah  what did he finally  get him for  molesting the kids  oh  did he do time  yeah he was in jail  yeah  for a while  and he came out  and then he was back in  and I don't know  whatever happened to him  but he got a lot of guys  and a bunch of people  listening to the show  go dude that guy  used to call me up  and talk dirty to me  was he only kiss on the cheek  or was he diddling too  just not you  but I mean  I don't know  I didn't hear anyone  that he actually had sex with  yeah  but I told that story  I don't know if I told it  last time 
[02:45:30]  yeah really  this guy  horrible game  this guy  yeah he's terrible  12 years old  this kid lives in Jersey  like Bloomfield  or something like that  or on Bloomfield Avenue  oh yeah tell us  yeah  how do you get there  be a good American  well you take the fucking  you take the path  so he was friends  so his parents  this guy convinced  this kid's parents  to let him stay  at his apartment  because there was a wrestling  match on a Saturday  so they dropped him off  they drove him to New York  dropped him off  at his apartment  holy fucking  and he was going to  bring him to the wrestling  match the next day  so as soon as the parents 
[02:46:00]  left the guy was all over  him trying to wrestle him  and grab him  and he's fighting him off  the whole time  and he just started crying  and the guy just said  oh just go to sleep  and he let him alone  in the morning  he woke up  he goes  call your parents  the wrestling match  got cancelled  and the parents had to  come in  and go pick him up  because he wouldn't put out  he wouldn't put out  do you think he got another  kid to go to the match  with him  he probably used that  for leverage  to get some more ass  probably  why would you go  with a kid  that you ain't going  to get any fucking  shit off of  imagine dropping  your son off  at 12 years old  at some creepy guy's house 
[02:46:30]  he stayed over  my house too  my father met him  Jesus  he stayed over  we put him in the guest room  he didn't sleep in my room  and that's when he snuck down  and touched me  he snuck down  yeah he snuck down  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the night  he wanted to show you a magic trick  he couldn't fucking control it  no he couldn't  he had to fucking  he knew little fucking  Jim Florentine  was asleep downstairs  he had to touch me  he was losing his mind  right  yeah  he's laying in bed  staring at the ceiling  just like  he's down there  he's fucking down there 
[02:47:00]  and I gotta  no I'm not  I'm gonna control myself  he's just thinking  I'm just gonna go to sleep  I gotta do  no I can't  I can't  it's too fucking risky  I gotta fucking  I gotta at least just  I'm gonna peek in the door  I'm just gonna peek  at him sleeping  I'm just gonna get out of the bed  I'm gonna go  take a leak  alright I'm not gonna go down  I'm just gonna go back  to my room now  I just wanna see  those big balls  I'm gonna go to the top  of the stairs  I'm gonna go to the top  of the stairs  giant balls  no I can't do this  I can't do this  alright I gotta go back  to my room  he's right behind that door  oh god he's right  down there 
[02:47:30]  he's right there  in that room  oh I hear him breathing  I hear him sleeping  and he even  my parents picked him up  at the bus station  at like 11 o'clock at night  I remember it was like  a Friday night  so I was already asleep  so when they brought him  to the house  he goes hey can I go  wake up Jim  tell him I'm here  and they go no he's sleeping  just see him in the morning  here's your room upstairs  and he actually came downstairs  I don't even know  how he found the room  because there's a bunch  of rooms in my old house  so he must have been  opening doors  looking for me  like let's make a deal  he won the fucking  big prize  yes  how stupid were our parents 
[02:48:00]  I know  because this shit  was happening  to our generation  it just wasn't talked  about that much  how stupid were they  they didn't see the signs  what was his MO  for being in your house  for your parents  even letting them  in your house  well my dad  used to take us  to the matches  me and the kids  in the neighborhood  so we met him  and he thought  this guy's a little weird  but you know  we'd go buy pictures  off him every time  we'd go meet him  in the same spot  but I remember  when he wanted  to stay over a house  and play with all  the kids in the neighborhood  all the parents  in the neighborhood  go that's weird  that some 40 year old  guy wants to  hang out with these kids 
[02:48:30]  let's invite them  over for dinner  and feel them out  so I remember  he had dinner  at our house  with a bunch of  the parents  in the neighborhood  sat around  and they were like  alright  let him stay over  next week  he's at the table  just sucking  on cocktail franks  yeah he's knocking  he's knocking  the pasta off  because it looks  like pubic hair  I don't want  any spaghetti  on my plate  just a plain sausage  he's watching me  eat a hot dog  oh yeah  just loving it  unbelievable  that's funny  they had to have  that's how  things were back then 
[02:49:00]  look  we want to talk  to this guy  before we expose  him to our kids  to make sure  he's not going  to rape them  I know  and meanwhile  they all were  terrible judges  of character  yeah really  horrible  what do you think  he's going to say  when he's at dinner  so where are your  children  I'd like to molest  them  oh good thing  we met with you  you got me  of course he's  on his best behavior  could you pass  your son's ass  the potatoes  the mash  the mash  the mash  oh shit  yeah man  we got the security  guard guys  come up to 
[02:49:30]  the apartment  when you know  we get deliveries  and there's already  a guy  I will not let  my kid even see  at this point  you just know  so what were  our parents thinking  I just know  the odds are  that this guy  is a creep  because my little  kid likes to  open up the door  you know  when he hears  the doorbell ring  and I always look  through the hole  and I go  nope it's that guy  there's no way  hide the kid  literally hide him  put him in the room  hide the kid  just the way  he kind of  talks to him  and he kind of  like touched him  innocently 
[02:50:00]  like just reached out  to grab his hand  or something  and my kid  was creeped out  I think they feel  that shit  yeah  yeah  and I said  nope  no more man  when he comes around  absolutely don't let him  go to the door  yeah  but our parents  what the fuck  were they doing  they were busy  drinking and smoking  it just wasn't  talked about back then  but they had  so you don't think  that they had to  have known  it was one of those  things that was  kept a secret  and when it happened  they thought it was  an anomaly  because nobody  admitted that shameful  shit  so they figured  like ah  it's just everybody  knows who the 
[02:50:30]  creeps are  they didn't realize  how prevalent it was  I'm on high alert  you're on high alert  it's also like  with the priest  and stuff  when you used  to hang out  with them  if someone even  told their parents  the parents  would go  he didn't do that  don't make that stuff up  don't cause any problems  or you just kept it quiet  they were torn  no one's gonna believe me  they were torn  between their faith  and taking care of  and doing the right thing  for your kid  torn between two lovers  my sister used to  my older sister  used to hitchhike  from high school  I was like two miles away  at like 3.30  in the afternoon  hitchhike home  what a fucking smorgasbord 
[02:51:00]  your young family was  I know  a fucking molester's  fucking buffet  the fucking florentines  were like a flea market  ass and pussy  can you imagine  hitchhiking to high school  as a teenage girl  there's one of those  florentine kids  you could drive around  all afternoon  in your neighborhood  and not even see a kid  that's where we're at  never mind hitching  and they were just  hitchhiking all over the place  during the yard  imagine being a molester  you're just driving around  fucking losing your mind  it's like a drive through 
[02:51:30]  you have to pick up the litter  all those dirty  fucking florentine kids  just looking  just asking for it  they would have like  yard sales  and for an extra five  you could go into  any bedroom  and talk to the kid  of your choice  just talk  just talk to one of our kids  imagine one of those guys  just driving around  the neighborhoods  oh yeah  she's  no I could do better  oh man  yeah yeah  yeah do you want to  pick this up  or you know  try to go for something  a little better  I'm gonna take a couple 
[02:52:00]  more circles  nah I'm gonna go  with the lazy eyed kid  with the crooked teeth  ah fuck  fuck it  I don't have game today  and I'm running out of candy  anyway  wow man  that's fucking  were you affected  by that at all  I don't think so  it doesn't seem like it  it really doesn't  no I don't  it seems like you  you just saw the big picture  yeah  you kissed for it  you know  I never got penetrated  so I think  yeah yeah  I think that would have  been the line  where maybe you're  affected 
[02:52:30]  oh I can't wait  till that memory  comes back  I hope it happens  like you're fucking  doing panel on  Letterman  and he says something  and all of a sudden  you remember  like being  both holes stuffed  oh shit  your mouth filled  with the fucking  picture guy  and then Ivan Koloff  that's why you wanted  that picture so bad  but if he would have  offered me his  professional camera  I probably would have  taken it in the shit  because I had one of  those little C110  little you know  things  oh yeah  those old school ones  you saw my shitty pictures  the little Kodak  what was it  the fucking like  that little cartridge 
[02:53:00]  that flipped in  it was very flat  so that guy had  the real camera  so I might have  Instamatic  a Kodak Instamatic  110 camera  ah  did it have a flash cube  no I didn't  you'd have to put  the flash cubes  before you even had  an electronic flash  on the camera  you had to put bulbs  in  remember that shit  I mean I don't remember  that shit  I was told those stories  growing up  Jim took some lousy  wrestling pictures  terrible  yeah I was  you know  how are you supposed  to kiss kids  if your pictures suck  what are you doing Sam  remember how hot 
[02:53:30]  those fucking bulbs  were  yeah  you'd wait 20 minutes  and they were still  fucking  yeah those things  hold on  Sam's taking  you like fucking  Charlie Sheen  in Wall Street  when he goes into  that fucking office  and he's taking  pictures of all the  documents  yeah look at you  what are you doing  you're taking pictures  of his pictures  you probably would have  done that right  I would have kissed  somebody for some  fucking lick  yeah see  well why don't you  kiss you for him  come on  what are you doing  have foreign to kiss you  if I can get the pictures  yeah what's wrong  can you you know  pass it on  I'm not giving these up  no way 
[02:54:00]  this is special  for him to even  take a picture  of your pictures  you should be able  to kiss him  on the cheek  yeah why don't we  do that  no not a picture  yeah yeah yeah  that's a fucking  so what  quarantine should be  able to kiss you  on the cheek  there should be  a cycle of abuse  that doesn't end  we should keep it  going  we really should  it's what the guy  would have wanted  I think you're  absolutely right  if Sam wants to  keep those pictures  he absolutely has  to kiss Florence  Florence what do you  want you want Sam  on your lap  or you want a kiss  if you'll give me  like some of the  original bruiser  brodies 
[02:54:30]  I'll sit on his lap  oh that see  yeah  you both see a good  abuse equity  in that picture  yeah yeah  it's worth some abuse  yeah that's about  what I did  for the picture  paid forward  hopefully some of  these have gone  up in value  yeah yeah  they went up  in value  you know  it was a kiss  back then  but look  you know  I gotta frame it  I gotta put it  on the wall  it's gonna be  in my shop  for a while  20 years later  that's a knuckle  but that's a knuckle  I think like a year

[03:02:00]  what do you got  tell this  it's almost impossible  to siphon gas  out of the newer  cars  you just gotta  poke a hole  in the gas  tank  and get it  that way  it's almost  impossible  to siphon  gas  as far as  new cars  go  yeah  they got  those springs  in there  and it's  hard to put  a hose  down  in the gas  tank  these days  that means  we're gonna  start  poking holes  in gas  tanks  yeah  she's an idiot  what's the best  way to puncture  a gas tank 
[03:02:30]  so we can  get their gas  you gotta be  careful  you don't want  like anything  to really get  hot  warmed up  I think just  a punch  a fucking  punch and a  hammer  bam  and then you  kinda put a  little gas  can under there  and you're  styling  not only am I  gonna take  Stephanie's gas  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  gurgle with  some of it  and just  spit it out  on the lawn  oh man  we're gonna  have so much  extra gas  that's right  and then you  know what  Stephanie's not 
[03:03:00]  even gonna know  and she's gonna  go and she's  gonna fill her  tank back up  but guess what  it's gonna have  a hole in it  hold on sir  Jeff what's  going on buddy  hey man  how's it going  oh  hey  what's up man  you were right  anarchy is  starting already  I'm out here  on route 112  there's um  the gas station  is waiting  until 9 o'clock  to open  until they get  the stock market  report  and we just  heard that  he's jacking up  the price  to 7 bucks  a gallon  wow  price gauging 
[03:03:30]  going on  gauging  gas gauging  sorry  gas gauge  price gouge  I really do  know that one  too  I'm an idiot  what happened  there's two  Suffolk County  cops here now  they said  they're sending  someone down  from the  attorney general's  office  because it's  price gouging  but it's  fucking crazy  exactly like  you predicted  three days later  well let me  tell you something  then why would  you deal with  all that shit  fist fights  and price  gouging  when you could  just siphon  gas 
[03:04:00]  you could just  siphon it  that's what I'm  gonna do  I got an old  neighbor's  I'm gonna take  it from my  old neighbor's  car  she's in  Brooklyn  fuck yeah  I got an idea 
[03:04:30]  what up  why deal with  siphoning when  you could just  carjack the person  right after they  fill up the tank  oh  should we take  their cars  right out of  the gas station  I'm thinking  that might be  even better  could do that  more efficient  could absolutely  once that car's  empty  you just go to  another gas station  yeah GTA  GTA rules  that sounds great  yes  Gundam Star  yeah  Gundam Star  carjack everyone

[03:14:00]  you know society's  collapsing  that's like rearranging  the deck chairs  on the titanic  cleaning the windows  during a fucking  breakdown of society  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2012  continues  right now  right now  right now  worst of 2012  for the Opie and Anthony  show  my name is E-Rock  in this segment here  Christopher Lloyd  the great Christopher Lloyd  is finally in studio  you may know him  from such things  as Suburban Commando  Taxi  of course  Back to the Future  we talk to him 
[03:14:30]  about all of this stuff  and a whole lot more  with the great  Christopher Lloyd  in studio now  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2012  busy day  Kevin Smith in studio  and now  Christopher Lloyd  Christopher Lloyd  take a seat  make yourself comfy  good morning sir  we're on the air  as they say  in this biz  how are you sir  how are you  good right  my god  got your coffee  is this early for you  so so  so so  not like a 
[03:15:00]  not a normal  early guy  I'm not  I gotta do this crap  every day  and I like sleep  I'm good like that  what are you  you're gonna be  at the Comic Con  yeah I'm gonna be there  alright  why don't you  pull that mic  a little closer  sir  you unfortunately  get a room full of people  who are just like  it's you  I know  maybe you can clear  something up for us  because we're trying  to figure out  your most famous role  I already know  what it is  they're insisting  of course 
[03:15:30]  it's Doc Brown  it's not Doc Brown  Mr. Tabor  is there anything  is that not the most  famous thing  you've ever done  it's made more  impression on me  than anything else  it was like  the first film  but as far as  the public goes  I would assume  it's probably  Doc Brown  yeah  see Jimmy  from that angle  yeah  what about Uncle Fester  they're both right  how many times a day  do people walk up to you  and go  Jack Dunphy's full of shit  yeah 
[03:16:00]  yeah  I know  not too often  not too often  yes  not too often  so  by the way  you're promoting  excuse me for living  and I read a brief  synopsis  what is this about  it seems really good  well it's kind of  a comedy  romantic comedy  kind of thing  I don't know  if it happens  in an asylum  oh  yeah  really  and  yeah  I'm this guy 
[03:16:30]  I've kind of  admitted myself  because I have  problems  you know  that sort of thing  so it's fiction  oh yeah  I would hope  oh yeah  yeah  I want to think  that  yeah  what are you trying  to say  yeah  it's fiction  yes of course  when you  when you  prepare for a role  or something  this is like a real  non-actor question  but do you  do you kind of  pull things from  your own personal life  or is that not  how you do it  oh I try to  yeah  I try to relate 
[03:17:00]  what do I  know about this guy  that I relate to  and kind of  bring it out  you know  I got nothing else  to go on  yeah  yeah  that's  that's  that's what I do  you've had some  pretty iconic roles  as far as like  Doc Brown  and of course  Reverend Jim  on Taxi  Mr. Tabern  Mr. Tabern  yeah  does that  does that make it  difficult  for an actor  to what  to be like 
[03:17:30]  to  to branch out  a little further  in other roles  no I love it  yeah  I'm always looking  for something  you know  because I get  a lot of scripts  that are kind of  spinoffs of Doc Brown  or Reverend Jim  or you know  and  I'll do it  if I can find a way  to do it differently  from what they thought  I was going to do it  yeah I'm always  looking  looking to  yeah  go in another  direction  but  I'm sure 
[03:18:00]  you've done roles  that you're very proud of  but don't get  the attention  that like  Back to the Future  does that bother you  at all  in any way  no  no  I mean  even this thing  I mean  you know  I wish  great success  and all that  but I don't think  it's going to have  a wide wide audience  yeah  but I love doing it  and  really very satisfied  with  you know  I really have  no regrets  even  yeah  I do some things  you know  when you rap  independent  if you rap  you don't know  if you'll ever  hear about it again 
[03:18:30]  right  yeah  but I don't  I don't care  there have been  some lemons  in your  there have been  some lemons  I mean  some of the shows  may not necessarily  be lemons  they just  don't  can't find  the future  but I've done  a few  you know  where they have  those volumes  of films  that are quick  synopsis  and they have  stars  that say  you know  you know  I have a few  marked with  turkeys  we all do  sir  we all do 
[03:19:00]  there's only one  that I really  really really  kind of just  I'm embarrassed  by but  oh really  yeah  and you're probably  going to ask me  which one  I would  I forgot  just don't say  cuckoo's nest  hey when you  auditioned for  Taxi  because it was  such an amazing  role and the way  they dressed drugs  did you come in  in the jacket  and kind of  create the look  before they even  knew  have you heard  about this  I have  I don't know  if it's a true  story  I hate to  repeat myself  yeah 
[03:19:30]  I got the  side so to speak  and I thought  I usually try to go  into an audition  dressed  to be the  character as nearly  as I see it  you know  and I had a  friend of mine  who lived up  in Laurel Canyon  which was a big  hippie settlement  at one time  and he was cleaning  out his bushes  and he found  this jacket  with a piece  thing on it  and I got some  worn out shoes  from an ex-father 
[03:20:00]  in law  and some worn  out jeans  and I did a  worn out that  and I wore it  and they said  when you come in  Monday  bring that  and I wore it  for the rest  of the run  wow  except during  one season  I came back  and somebody  had stolen it  from the  oh shit  so they found  another one  but yeah  does that answer  your question?  Phenomenal  when you set  Louie's apartment  on fire  and he said  I was cooking  something on the  stove  and he said 
[03:20:30]  it was a  bean bag chair  what a great  character  what a great show  it's one of the  greatest sitcoms  of all time  yeah I think  I said  something to  Danny  I didn't think  he'd notice  fabulous writers  fabulous writers  do you see  TV writing  as being a little  softer and different  now  because we were  talking about  how back then  it was real people  on TV  like yourself  and Danny DeVito  and Danza  was the good  looking guy  but do you see  that we've  kind of gotten 
[03:21:00]  away from that  maybe  I don't watch  that religiously  but I did  a pilot  I just did  a pilot  for the second  time  and it's  called  Kings of Van  Eyes  and it's  a family  that are  like on  the very  bottom  of the  economic  ladder  and it's  a comedy  and  each episode  they're looking  for a get  rich  theme  scheme  and  it always  fails 
[03:21:30]  but  I like it  because the  characters  are very  raw  they're  multi-ethnic  and they're  nuts  there's not  anything really  civilized  about it  and I'm  kind of  loving it  and so I  hope it gets  picked up  that's something  you don't see  very often  yeah  and it's  scheduled  for Friday  nights  when people  are home  having beer  and just  get something  that's kind  of loose  and risky  nuts 
[03:22:00]  so I  hope it  goes  do you  do like  oh sorry  Andy Kaufman  yeah  always wanted  to know  I mean  you worked  with the  dude  first hand  what was  he  the public  persona  we all  saw  the bits  he did  the stuff  he did  it seemed  genius  what was  he like  when no  cameras  were around  could you  have a  conversation  with the  dude  or was  he always  on  yeah  we kind  of took  to each  other  sort of  I mean  I was  a new  guy  on the  show  and he  took me  to some  of his  mud wrestling  matches 
[03:22:30]  and I  was like  you know  this is all  new to me  interesting  but he  he was  kind of  very mild  personally  you know  when he  wasn't working  very mild  very likable  kind of  guy  very sincere  and people  asked me  was he  nuts  and I  don't think  he was  nuts at  all  I think  he knew  exactly  what he  was doing  he had  an agenda  he had  an idea  of the 
[03:23:00]  kind  of  comedy  he wanted  to present  and his  take on  things  and he  set about  doing it  and  he was  very  sane  he just  had  followed a  different  drummer  or something  like that  I remember  one time  I was thinking  about it  the other  day  it was  so  gutsy  we were  in rehearsal  during  taxi  once in a while  he wouldn't  I remember  one night  he didn't  show up  time to  go on  and  as a  result  the 
[03:23:30]  order of  the scenes  being done  had to be  pushed around  and somebody  found him  in the  parking lot  in his  car  doing  oom drills  or something  with his  girlfriend  so  he was a  little bit  like that  one day  Tony  got so  infuriated  he got  a fire  extinguisher  and went  into  Andy's 
[03:24:00]  dressing room  and went  you know  that foam  and sprayed  him  but one  time  somehow  the talk  came into  levitation  and  Andy was  sort of  in that  realm of  spiritual  whatever  and he  said  yeah I  could  levitate  and there  was a  break  a 10  minute  break  on the  stage  where the  camera  and he  said okay  I'll  levitate  and he  sat down  on the  floor  of the  stage  and everybody  is like  you know 
[03:24:30]  he's putting  himself out  there  and he  sat down  and took  the yoga  position  the whole  thing  and we  waited  for him  to levitate  and it  was kind  of  I mean  who does  that  you know  I mean  he put  himself  on the  line  and he  just  sat there  and finally  the production  man said  we gotta  continue  rehearsal  what a  weird thing  to do  but he  was just  sitting there  and we're  looking at  him  and he  was like  perfectly  composed  he just  knew everybody  would sit 
[03:25:00]  there  that was the  whole gimmick  everyone watching  him  yeah  what a  weird  let's watch  yeah  I think  the idea  was like  with this  dude  anything  might be  possible  if he  believes  it enough  isn't  gonna  happen  I remember  when I was  a kid  and when  he passed  there were  a lot  of people  that were  like  he's not  gone  he's just  waiting  and then  man he's  gonna spring  on the  public  and every  like 10  years  somebody  writes an  article  about  hey man  this would  be about  the time  that Andy  would pop  and I  always dream  that like 
[03:25:30]  I'll be  50 60  years old  and like  the dude  just waiting  for the  perfect  moment  to be  like  and he  actually  the ultimate  like  that would  be the  ultimate  Andy Kaufman  oh man  right  at least  from a  spectator  point of  view  yeah  I love  I love  to  one of my  greatest  Christopher  Lloyd  moments  again  taxi  and this  the writing  was brilliant  but this  was all  you  is when  you're  at  Harvard  and you  take one  bite  out of  that  brownie  and you  say some  people  get addicted  to drugs  I could  be one  of those  people  and you 
[03:26:00]  go into  the gym  face  and then  back to  the  oh my  god  you're just  funny  I thought  that moment  moment was  I was new  on the show  and I just  thought that  moment was  so forced  I just  thought you  know  and then  whatever  and I  it's not very  helpful for  the radio  listening  it was an  excellent  face  you took  it to  right  the  Christopher  smiled  it seemed  to work  one of the  first time  the first  almost the 
[03:26:30]  first show  I did  as a  regular  because I  was a  guest  I married  Lofka  I was a  guest on  the show  about a  month before  I became  a regular  and I  married  I came  in  and they  got me  off the  street  to marry  Lofka  to some  woman  so he  could get  his green  card  and then I  came back  as a  regular  and I  did the  scene  where I  get my  driver's  license  and then  we broke  we broke  for the  for the  Christmas  holidays  and they 
[03:27:00]  handed out  the scripts  we were  going to  do  when we  came back  and it  was this  episode  where I  have a  horse  that dies  in my  bed  Gary  Gary  I just  thought  are they  nuts  this isn't  funny  that I  understood  a little  more about  comedy  you said  he was  sleeping  Gary was  sleeping  on his  back  for like  three  days  so your 
[03:27:30]  approach  to it  you didn't  come through  comedic  acting  you came  through  straight up  performance  were you  theater trained  where did  you begin  I started  here  I lived  kind of  nearby  and went  to the  neighborhood  playoffs  for a  couple  of  years  and  yeah  totally  I did  Cuckoo's Nest  my first  film  that's  your  first  film  I was  33  or 34  when that  happened  had you  been in  the play  at all  or no  I'd done  a lot  of plays  but not  that play  not the  Cuckoo's Nest  play  no  I hadn't  done  that  no 
[03:28:00]  so  you went  to  it was  your  first  audition  somebody  said  hey man  they're  casting  a movie  and you're  like  alright  we'll  try it  out  yeah  the  casting  director  here  and he  submitted  me  for it  and I  auditioned  a couple  of times  and then  that's a  young  Milos  Foreman  man  he's  a pup  at that  point  did you  keep in  touch  with  Will  Sampson  after  I  did  for a  while  we  spent  a lot  of time  together  don't ask 
[03:28:30]  me why  but we  did  he was  such  an  extraordinary  iconic  person  and  he just  had a  presence  about him  that was  stunning  he was  so tall  and just  self  possessed  he was  amazing  and then  Danny DeVito  of course  Mr. Martini  which I  think is  his most  famous role  you guys  did before  Taxi  together  it's odd 
[03:29:00]  when things  like that  happen  when you  show up  on Taxi  you're  like  hey man  small  world  and he  pretended  he didn't  know you  because you  were the  new  guys  like  yeah  that  was  them  this  is  now  go  marry  latke  this  is  my  show  as  far  as  Back  to  the  Future  goes  what  it's  just  such  popular  culture  now  what  is  the  one  thing  people  ask  you  the  most  about  that  question  because  it's  always  the 
[03:29:30]  time  travel  questions  did  this  happen  and  how  many  DeLoreans  were  there  and  what's  the  one  that  you  get  asked  the  most  I  don't  know  yeah  I  don't  know  yeah  but  it  must  be  then  a lot  of  the  same  kind  of  questions  a lot  of  people  do  an  impersonation  of  Doc Brown  well of  course  it is  one of  those  that  people  love  doing  an  impression  that  and  the  one  they  say  great  Scott  and  stuff  like 
[03:30:00]  Rhodes  we're  going  we  don't  need  Rhodes  all  of  us  are  going  to  make  you  do  that  on  our  phones  before  we  leave  today  please  Christopher  yeah  they  just  which  one  I  like  the  best  of  the  three  and  I  always  say  the  third  one  you  do  yeah  and  the  most  Doc  Brown  is  it's  all  about  it  is  Doc  Brown  it  was  in  the  west  and  western  is  always  fun  horseback  riding  that's  always  fun  yeah 
[03:30:30]  working  on that  locomotive  locomotive  those  steam engines  were amazing  they were  amazing  yeah  that was  the real  deal  organism  and they  weren't  very  CG  heavy  in those  days  so  that was  a lot  of  real  locomotive  work  right  the  computer  graphics  that came  later on  but  yeah  but  you  were  actually  on  a  train  and  apparently  no  two  even  two  identical  steam  engines  they're  not  the  same  they  have  their  own  maybe 
[03:31:00]  like  a  sailboat  you  have  to  do  a  little  more  of  this  a  little  more  of  that  each  one  is  individualized  but  it's  like  it's  amazing  it's  amazing  like  a  living  beast  yeah  it is  that's  amazing  do  people  ask you  about  Doc  Brown  a lot  do  they  ever  come  up  to  you  and  ask  oh  and  I  had  a  romance  too  yes  finally  a  romance  that was  the last  one I did  on film  first and last  except I had one  where I blew up  my romance 
[03:31:30]  as Captain  Krug  and  that's  true  yes  she  was  on  the  other  spaceship  and  I had to  blow it  up  sorry  sorry  honey  that was  the search  for Spock  that was  yeah  that was  the one  when  you  yeah  you were  a Klingon  that was  kind of  when they  first got  into that  Klingon  heavy  makeup  yeah  because  in the  original  Star Trek  series  it was  just  a guy  with a 
[03:32:00]  Fu Manchu  that's  all they  had  a little  more  alien  I mean  that's  obviously  I'm a  big fan  of  oh I'm  sorry  I was  only going  to ask  about  the scene  where you  kept poking  Mr.  Harding  and telling  him to  play the  game  play the  game  Harding  play the  game  Jimmy  loves  it's a  masterpiece  but that  was such  a great  that was  such a  great  you were  just so  fucking  annoyed  with  him  quit  touching  me  see  son of 
[03:32:30]  bitch  so  three  was  your  favorite  to do  and to  watch  I don't  know  I  enjoyed  the  first one  I also  like  them all  I kind  of get  off  of the  third  one  the most  because  I had  that  romance  and I  had  a lot  of toys  I had 
[03:33:00]  that  huge  machine  that I  invented  that  ice  maker  all the  steam  and a  little  cube  would  come  out  and  then  there's  always  the  questions  that  obviously  you have  nothing  to do  with  you  were  the  actor  playing  Doc  Brown  but  it's  like  what  if  the  Libyans  would  have  shot  you  in  the  head  I  mean  you  didn't  know  the  note  just  said  you  were  shot  by the  Libyans  you  know  you  weren't 
[03:33:30]  going  to  get  shot  in  the  head  so  you  wear  a  vest  I  have  run  into  a  couple  of  Libyans  there  was  not  a  they  were  not  happy  about  it  they  weren't  that  they  had  been  chosen  to  be  to  be  the  bad  guys  in  one  of  the  most  beloved  films  of  all  time  when  they  watched  it  back  in  their  country  there  was  not  a  good  feeling  about  it  that  scared  me  they  should  have  just  dubbed it  differently  said they were 
[03:34:00]  Jews  they should  have just  dubbed it  differently  look  the Mexicans  can we talk  about the  installment  back to the  future  that never  gets the  respect  it's owed  is the  ride  man  the ride  was a  mini adventure  within the  movies  and you're  a big  feature  in the  ride  you waited  with us  in line  and come  up on the  video all  the time  and keep  us updated  you and  Biff  and then  once you  get into  the ride  it's all  Doc Brown  yes 
[03:34:30]  it's pretty  amazing  the rules  of what we  had to do  it was all  Doc Brown  telling us  what to do  and when we  go into the  mouth of the  Tyrannosaurus  great Scott  it's a  Tyrannosaurus  that ride  is amazing  I don't know  if they've  done it in  Florida  but in  Hollywood  they replaced  it with  the Simpsons  ride  but the  Back to the  Future one  I think is  still in  the Japanese  Universal  Studios  if I remember  correctly  it is a  fantastic  ride  and the  first of  its kind  one of  those  motion rides  now it's 
[03:35:00]  everywhere  they got one  for the  Transformers  up at  Universal  there's a  King Kong  tram ride  but this is  the first  ride where  you jumped  into a  DeLorean  with a bunch  of other  people  a large  oversized  DeLorean  and it was  an interactive  experience  you were in  little rooms  watching videos  yeah when  you were waiting  on line  it wasn't  just waiting  on line  you were in  those little  rooms  and the  note was  there  and the  show began  while you  were waiting  in line  and then the  car would be  elevated to  essentially an  IMAX screen 
[03:35:30]  and based on  your perspective  the screen is  big you're not  seeing people to  your right and  to your left  unless you're a  jackass who  cranes your head  over and be  like oh there's  the other car  stop ruining  the illusion  totally but if  you want to  bury in the  illusion man  suddenly you  were taken  through time  guided by Doc  Brown who would  be on a little  screen in the  car periodically  it was phenomenal  man I would go  on it then get  off the ride  go back again  it was a ride  you could do  five times in a  row and still  see different  things each time  and it fit into  the continuity 
[03:36:00]  of Back to the  Future  that was the  important thing  for a nerd  it really fit  it wasn't like  oh this has  nothing to do  with the movies  it was an adjunct  that worked  without Marty  McFly  it was awesome  it was cool  you did a great  piece of work  there  that's heavy  lifting because  you're the whole  show at that  point  did you  burn your  leg really  when you guys  were throwing  around Mr.  Harding's cigarette  and it landed  in the cup  of your pants  did you really  get burned  I didn't really  get burned  okay I wanted  to ask you  after 30 years  but 
[03:36:30]  Milos Forman  got the idea  from that  he was  before he  defected  from Czechoslovakia  he was  late at night  on his train  platform  waiting for a  train  and there  was a guy  smoking  on the  platform  and he  took the  butt  and flicked  it  and it  landed  in the  cuff  of somebody  else  that was  waiting on  the platform  and they  didn't notice  it until  their pants  began to burn  up  and he said  the guy  totally 
[03:37:00]  flipped out  he just  went screaming  and crazy  on the platform  and that's  and that was  his inspiration  to get that  in the movie  but you  couldn't have  looked crazier  and nobody  knew that  a cigarette  butt  had been  thrown  so even  though  I think  you were  one of  the very  few  that was  committed  it was  you  and  Chief  Bromden  and maybe  one of  the person  that were  actually  committed  I'm babbling  no  it's a  great movie  let's take  it to  Buckaroo  Banzai  does anybody 
[03:37:30]  on set  know what  they were  making  or they  were just  like  we just  trust the  director  I think  they knew  what they  were doing  the producer  of the film  was kind  of a crazy  guy  I think  he'd been  cited  for  doing  funny  illegal  stuff  but  I don't  think he  fully  understood  what he  was producing  because there  was a lot  of complaints  from people  of all 
[03:38:00]  of the show  that the way  he edited  it  he didn't  really  know what  he was  working  with  but we  knew  it was  so crazy  and it  was so  cool  and such  a great  cast  Peter Weller  and so  many others  it was  Dan Hedaya  is in it  too  John Lithgow  right  what's her  name  she's on  that show  now  Ellen Barkin  I remember  Ellen Barkin  lying out  practically 
[03:38:30]  naked  and whereas  me and  Vince Kievelli  and the  other one  there were  three of us  would become  crazy  they'd become  the aliens  and she  lying there  and we  were doing  something with  her  and she  had real  spiders  crawling on  her  I don't know  if you remember  that  yeah  they put  this kind  of jelly  on her  and then  they were  putting stuff  on her  it's  sexy  oh man  how did  she look  almost  naked  yeah  he just 
[03:39:00]  nods his  head  if you heard  that nod  it's a  confirmation  I think  that's the  more important  part of the  story  that was  Jim  Reverend Jim  showed up  for one second  you were  fryers  roasted  we were  hosted by  the friar  you were  honored by  the friars  oh boy  honored by  the friars  oh boy  I had  my house  burned out  no the  friars  oh the  friars 
[03:39:30]  yeah not  the fires  no  well scratch  you don't even  need the  headphones  if you don't  want  take them  off  yeah these  people  yeah you  don't need  to be  the fries  yeah we  all went  there  the cast  for  excuse me  for living  good  and three  of us  were honored  with  cast of  the air  um  jerry  stiller  and uh  oh jesus  they'll kill  me  yeah don't 
[03:40:00]  go  make yourself  nuts over it  yeah  you got  you got  through  ellen  barking  naked  there's  not  exactly  you're  still  recovering  from it  yeah  so yeah  that was  that was  interesting  i've never  been there  before  yeah  how have  you moved  on since  i mean  the fire  you call  we talked  to you  on the  phone  after that  and uh  you seem  like as  devastating  as that  is that  you handled  it  like kind  of like  hey it's  what life  does  and you  seem  to handle  that  better than  most people  would have  yeah  it was  sort of  sort of  strange  but uh 
[03:40:30]  it's all  rebuilt  oh yeah  oh yeah  it's all  cool  but that  was odd  wow  how do you  what's the  process after  that you  just you  just kind  of decompress  for a while  or  kind of  decompress  uh  i had a  friend  and she  um  uh  she wanted  to  she wanted  to get  into the  building  she's a  real estate  but she  wanted to  get into  the building  and she  never liked  the house  particularly  and i could  see the  wheels going  around  there  you know  she wasn't 
[03:41:00]  really grieving  oh really  yeah  well let's  make some  lemonade  yeah  yeah  she proposed  can i rebuild  here  take it  it's not  something she  was had  uh  experienced  in doing  but she  i felt  yeah she  could do  this  and she  took it  over  and rebuilt  this  kind of  semi  tuscan  like  uh  residence  and it  turned out  beautifully  are you  scared to  be in  the same  spot  wasn't  it the 
[03:41:30]  california  fires  the wildfires  yeah  are you  scared to  be in  the same  spot  no  uh  because  we're  selling  it  oh  not my  worry  okay  no but  it's  it's  take  it was  built  to try  to make  it  less  flammable  less  flammable  and  the  landscaping  is  you know  we don't  have  dried up  bushes  yeah  yeah  so it was  kind of  asking for  it was  kind of  built for  a disaster 
[03:42:00]  the first  time  not thinking  well not  really  i mean  they hadn't  had a fire  in that  area for  20-30  years  yeah  it was  just  dry  very dry  at that  point  too  were there  were there  some  very  like  personally  valuable  things  that  you  lost  that  were  well  i moved  out of  it  and moved  downtown  kind of  and about  90% of my  stuff was in  storage  oh wow  i moved  out of it  to sell it  and then  the slump  you know 
[03:42:30]  real estate  yeah  yeah  so  i was  going to  resell  i was going to  sell the place  i moved it  to  move back  up there  until the  market  recovered  and did  some cosmetic  stuff and then  suddenly the  fire came  so most of  that stuff  was in  storage  oh that's  great  totally man  but i mean  so many people  got totally  wiped out  yeah  yeah  their cars  everything  that's awful  i was just  thinking like  because with  a career like  you've had  you must have  some memories 
[03:43:00]  and just  little trinkets  and tokens  of what you've  done that  would be  terrible to  lose  jesus  i have  some but  they weren't  necessarily  related to  my business  it was  no  like more  personal  family stuff  i'm just  thinking like  well you know  maybe a signed  picture of  yourself  brown wig  that's what  we think  he's got  like family  stuff  wasn't that  that hat  you wore  in scene  age  please tell  me the  flux capacitor 
[03:43:30]  wasn't in  the house  thank christopher  loyden  what a great  great day to  have you here  fantastic  sir  thanks so  much  i'm happy  that you're  still working  and still  making great  stuff  yeah thanks  so much  man  this is  opian anthony's  worst of  2012  well you know  my pool  was open  yesterday  i saw the  fucking  pictures  yes  is it almost  full  well yes  it is  and that's  my concern  my concern 
[03:44:00]  is  why is there  a concern  well because  i don't want  it to overflow  oh it's still  filling up  right now  it's still  filling up  faster than  they thought  yeah i could  watch it though  i know exactly  where it is  it's fine  because ang  is going  there  and uh  she just  uh put  a great  question  forth to  me  on my  messages  uh which  i think is  something that  somebody writes  as a question  when you really  don't think it  out for three  seconds  okay  uh i said  yeah you know 
[03:44:30]  to turn the  water off  if it's up  she goes  okay  where's the  shut off  for the  water  oh  i just put  at the other  end of the  hose  oh okay  it's like  see if you  follow the  hose  okay  from the  end that  the water  is coming  out of  right  there's usually  a valve  that shuts  the water  off  and i said  uh-oh  because i look  like an  asshole  but i'm  thinking i mean  you've got a  big house  and stuff  i don't know  if there's  some special  thing in the  fucking basement  that's a  fucking hose  in the end  it's just  a hose  it's just 
[03:45:00]  a hose  that goes  in the  pool  so it's  time to  shut off  the water  now  yeah  when can  you actually  jump in  it  because you're  going to  heat it up  obviously  uh well  yeah  yeah  well uh  they got to  fill it up  obviously  there  yeah  could it  be ready  to go  this weekend  uh  between the  chemicals  and cleaning  what day  is it  tuesday  it could  be  it could  be  at least  put it  this way  at least  the jacuzzi  is good  for jacuzziing  i could turn  the heat on  and really  get that  thing bubbling  hot 
[03:45:30]  uh the rest  of the pool  though  probably be a  little chilly  for about  maybe a week  or so  until i  can build  that temperature  up  so you're  going to  be in the  jacuzzi  this weekend  for sure  that does  seem to be  the uh  and there's  ang laughing  haha ang  that was a  silly question  uh yeah  i'd probably  be in the  jacuzzi  relaxing  a little  wine  uh  play some  i got  the sonos  system  we blast  out some  fucking  sirius xm's  lithium  out the  fucking  speakers  and i  will be  a  chilling  niggas

[03:46:30]  i forgot what  mountain it  was when i  was skiing a  lot  oh yeah  i was gonna  get back  into skiing  this winter  but they  basically  never got  snow  i mean  some of the  place  i'm exaggerating  but it was  a horrible  year for  the resorts  yeah  but i used  to go to  this one  mountain  where uh  yeah you  jump in  the jacuzzi  man you  run  you run  in the snow  it's like  fucking  10-15  degrees out  you jump in  that hot  jacuzzi  for a little  while  it's awesome  i did that  up in  aspen  one year  in aspen  and uh  just sitting  there puffing  on the big  cigars 
[03:47:00]  and you got  a big  fucking glass  of wine  sure  ah you got  your wine  you got  your jacuzzi  your snow  boom  by the time  you make  it back  to the condo  though  your hair  is literally  frozen  like it's  it's cracky  ice frozen  that's why  i don't believe  in that cold  shit  because you  didn't get  a cold  from that  right  no no  no  hey uh  do you  remember  when we  were in  uh  i think  it was  maine  skiing  for af  oh  yes  sunday  mountain  and they  had a  heated  sunday  river  sunday  river  which is  a nightmare  to get  to  yeah  but when  you do  get there  it's a good  time  uh

But she kind of like, she went over to that chair, looked at the newspaper, looked in here  and went, oh boy, and walked away.  Yeah.  You saw that, right?  No part of this.  She went, oh boy.

All she wants to do is have some fun.  That's true.  She's the only one.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Bling, bling, bling.

[04:27:30]  All right.  Oh.  What year?  What is it?  All right.  Start jerking them off.  Sam.  Come on, Sam.  Pull it out.  What was it?  Oh, shit.  What?  I want to open a fudge shop and then dub in fudge.  So she's singing, all I want to do is have some fudge.  And I want to put it on a loop as people come in and shop.  And then get sued by her.  How annoying.  Have her.  Oh, just over and over. 
[04:28:00]  All I want to do is have some fudge.  It's not even done well.  Have her walk by the studio so we can just do that.  Just to annoy her for a split second.  I would love to annoy her for a second.  I want to have her walk by and grab my cell phone and go, hey, it's for you.  And hand it to her.  Oh.  I think she'd appreciate that.  No.  You don't think people would like that?  It would be so annoying.  All I want it to is have fudge.  It's so annoying.  You can't even blend it in, though. 
[04:28:30]  You can't.  I'd run out of that store.  And it's just a really cool fudge place.  And everybody's dancing to it.  And all you do is we have all kinds of fudges.  But, like, really weird shaped fudges.  Like the fucking, yeah, just awful.  Terrible.  Yeah.  What a horrible idea for a store.  And they do, like, a fucking, the staff.  It's like a Cold Stone staff where they all clap together.  And she goes, all I want to do is have some.  And they go, fudge.  They all do fudge together. 
[04:29:00]  So nothing ever gets done.  Thank you.  They're doing it constantly.  Never want to go to this store.  Fudge.  Yeah, I like that.  Come on.  Get a terrible store.  Oh, fuck.  Fudge.  Oh, God.  It works.  What would you call the store?  Fudge.  No, but it's got to be something like fun fudge.  Oh.  Fudging the numbers.  What's...  What's... 
[04:29:30]  A very funny tweet.  I got to read that.  All right.  Enough.  Cheryl Crow got brain cancer from Lance Armstrong resting his rotten ball back on her face.  Jesus. 
[04:30:00]  Jesus Christ.  Fudge.  Fudge.  What do you want to do tonight, hon?  Let's go down to fudging the numbers.  Fudging the numbers.  You don't think that's good?  Fudging the numbers.  Like the commercial would have this song in it without her permission.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd be like, it's a different song.  No, it's fudge.  All I want is to have to fudge.  And what you do is you show carloads of teenagers getting out and dancing, dancing into the fudge shop. 
[04:30:30]  Oh, how douchey.  Oh, God.  That sucks.  Going to fudging the numbers.  Fudging the numbers, huh?  Well, let's get her on the show.  Who, Cheryl?  Yeah, let's get her on the show.  She ain't coming in.  Why?  She did it.  Oh, she's already out of the building?  She's gone, so.  What's wrong with these people that want to promote and then they're in a facility where  there's a shitload of places to go and they only do one or two shows?  Yeah.  Maybe because she knows it's the kind of show that would read a tweet that mentions Lance  Armstrong's rotten ball bag.  Fair enough.  What about the other shows that aren't mentioning his rotting ball bag? 
[04:31:00]  Boy, did he fall from fucking grace.  Yeah.  Lancey.  America's hero anymore, right?  Wow.  He doped up.  He doped, right?  I think he did, too.  Some people are like, he just didn't want to fight it anymore.  That's bullshit.  No, you don't get that far in a game.  He doped.  Because then a lot of people are saying everyone doped back then.  Yeah.  I know E-Rock dopes.  Everybody.  Oh, E-Rock continues to dope.  Looks like my wife, Susan. 
[04:31:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  My fat wife, Eric.  Forrest, this is my fat Asian wife, Eric.  He's not Asian fat.  Yeah, but he would love fudging the numbers.  Oh, boy.  Remember, he's not a sweets guy.  Yeah, but he would enjoy this because we would have little toppings.  One of the toppings would be steak and onions on your fudge.  On your fudge.  Sounds terrible.  Yeah, the fudge patty surprise sandwich.  Fudging the numbers. 
[04:32:00]  Which is two fudge pieces of fudge.  And like a surprise in the middle of meat.  Like Tuesdays would be meatloaf with a fudge patty surprise.  Just picturing the teens dancing into the place.  But they're all going, all I want to do is have some fudge.  And they're clapping.  And they're clapping and dancing.  Yeah, as they walk in smiling.  One white, one black, one Asian.  Of course.  Yeah.  Oh, I hate that place.  But there's really weird things happening.  Like there's a guy in a clan hood and a black guy dancing together to the fudge song. 
[04:32:30]  Fudge brings them all together.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Fudge will do that.  The clan guy is saying, all I want to do is hang some fudge.  Oh, shit.  You got this figured out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been working on this for fucking 17 years.  All right, that's it for the worst of 2012. </pre>
