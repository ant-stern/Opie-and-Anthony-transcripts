<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with vulgar banter and a sexually explicit discussion, transitioning to complaints about their frigid studio and their antagonistic relationship with their ex-convict security guard.  Numerous anecdotes about the guard's behavior and the hosts' reliance on security cards were shared. The conversation then veered into a graphic discussion about their experiences with cleaning ladies and pornography, including detailed descriptions of adult films and performers, further fueled by their cleaning lady's discovery of their pornography stash. A caller incorrectly assumed the security guard was Black, prompting a correction and further discussion of the guard and post-9/11 security anxieties.

The show then promoted an upcoming eggnog-drinking contest with an XM MiFi satellite radio as a prize,  followed by an angry tirade against the replacement of "Merry Christmas" with "Happy Holidays,"  expanding into highly critical and offensive commentary about various religious and cultural groups, political correctness, and the invention of holidays like Kwanzaa.  This segment concluded with more vulgar remarks and further promotion of the eggnog contest.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on societal issues, particularly perceived minority group complaints and the perceived media overreaction.  The hosts, using strong and offensive language, expressed frustration with what they considered disproportionate attention to these complaints. Topics included Christmas celebrations, gay adoption, and the perceived inaction of the majority population. Callers echoed these sentiments, often with similarly offensive language.  Opie graphically described his bowel movements, attributing them to high-fiber cereal.  The hosts discussed the lack of FCC regulation of satellite radio and a radio station owner's self-serving attempt to advocate for it.  Callers recounted provocative encounters and the creation of a violent video game.  An angry message was played from the show's "F.U." line. A Mexican-American caller delivered a comedic bit about Mexican stereotypes.

Professional wrestler Triple H joined the show, both in-studio and via phone.  Initially, the discussion centered on gift ideas, professional wrestling injuries (including Triple H's own serious quadriceps injury and kneecap fracture), and the increasing danger of wrestling moves.  Triple H discussed his movie career, specifically his experience working with Wesley Snipes and Ryan Reynolds on *Blade: Trinity*, mentioning Snipes' difficult behavior.  The conversation continued to cover various wrestlers, including The Rock, Hulk Hogan and his daughter, X-Pac, and China, whose pornographic video was discussed at length.  Triple H discussed China's departure from WWE and the subsequent struggles of wrestlers leaving the organization.  The impact of wrestling websites and spoilers was also addressed.

The show then featured Serena, a model from Citystylegirls.com, who engaged in sexually explicit conversation and interaction with the hosts and Triple H, including a live on-air spanking by Jim Norton.  Serena was completely nude during this segment.  Her boyfriend entered the studio, and further sexual acts occurred on-air. This segment heavily featured discussion of Serena's website, her age, her entry into the porn industry, and spanking preferences. A crudely made sex toy was shown.  A phone call with Mendy, another adult film performer, was also included.  Further promotion of Serena’s websites and the eggnog contest took place.  A brief discussion of Jim Norton’s *Steppin’ Out* magazine profile was also included.

The final segment concentrated on the eggnog-drinking contest's logistics, with Master Poe's meticulous planning highlighted.  Crude humor and sexual innuendo were prevalent.  Listener-submitted audio clips, including a rap song and numerous Lacey Peterson-themed songs, were played.  Calls from Carl (regarding listenership) and Phil (boasting about sleeping with strippers) were featured. A lengthy and contentious call with “Lady Di,” marked by lying and mocking, occurred, with accusations and crude jokes.  The segment concluded with promotions for the eggnog contest (including instructions for contestants to bring food), the contest rules (double shots every minute until vomiting), and a "What Did We Learn?" segment with listener calls, off-color jokes, and a story about robbers being scared off by a Grand Theft Auto game.  Finally, more audio snippets of listener-submitted songs were played.

[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the passport.  Get your cock out.  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for both people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, violent girls.  What kind of sick mind operates like that? 
[00:07:30]  The O.B. and Anthony show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Oh my god, it feels so good.  Oh my god, it feels so good.  Oh yeah, oh, oh, oh, slow down, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, push your daddy, push your daddy. 
[00:08:00]  Oh my god.  Oh yeah, play with my boys, play with my boys.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around in a circle.  Oh my god.  I love it with you.  Uh-oh, slow down.  Oh yeah.  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel. 
[00:08:30]  We're tanks for nothing.  Ah.  This calls for the old Billy Barool.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is a biggie.  How would you like to blow my law?  Huh?  Well, we're waiting.  All right, all right, we'll get to it.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I got it from a Negro.  I think this place is restricted, wank, so don't tell me you're Jewish.  Funny every time.  Oh, yeah.  I haven't watched Caddyshack in about two weeks.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Yeah.  A little higher, Anthony?  Just a little bit.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:09:30]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to our faithful listeners.  Yeah.  Turning on the new listeners as we go.  We greatly appreciate that.  Got to start off by saying it's fucking cold in here, man.  What's up?  This place has no heat.  I don't know what it is.  No, I think the building does have heat, but they probably turn it on around 6, 7.  We're the only ones in this building, so why would they have the heat on for us?  I didn't think about that.  Is it one of those automated heating systems that come on when the regular people come into work?  You got to think, because we're all just bundled up, holding ourselves, trying to stay warm. 
[00:10:00]  Ben is holding his hands in front of Steve and rubbing them.  Yeah, that is really an obnoxious flame shirt today, man.  Wow, that is really flaming.  The flames go all the way up his torso today.  Yeah, it was laundry day yesterday.  Yeah.  So I have seven or six fresh flame shirts.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Screw it, right?  But I got to tell you, you know, winter finally here in New York, and there's no turning back now. 
[00:10:30]  And I think we're going to have a problem.  We're the only ones in this building at this hour, except for the guy downstairs.  Wow, the drunk.  Believe me, he's warm.  Yeah.  Taking some nips.  So it's very cold in the studio.  And speaking of the guy downstairs.  Oh, yeah.  I almost had another problem today, and I was too scared to do anything about it.  Of course you are.  He has terrorized the entire staff of the Opie and Anthony program.  He's got me in line.  He's my best friend now.  Yeah?  Best friend.  We have a relationship. 
[00:11:00]  I walk in.  I see him down the long hallway sitting there, and I get my card ready, pull it out, hand it right over to him.  And as I'm signing in, he's doing whatever he does with it.  I don't know what he's got.  I don't know why he needs to see my card every morning.  But he swipes it through something.  And then he lets you go.  No, no, no.  We have a relationship, I said.  You have a relationship with the guy?  Yes, I say.  I thought that was your relationship, that you hand over the card without getting punched in the face or yelled at. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Every morning.  See, really fast, got to explain to the new listeners.  We have a guy downstairs.  He's security, I guess.  And he's an ex-convict, we found out.  He seems like security, doorman, maintenance, like the jack-of-all-trades guy.  Sleeper.  Yeah.  Because he used to just sleep on the job, but then XM hires us, and now he has to let us in the building every morning.  Someone has to ring the doorbell.  Who has to do that?  He's always, no, I'm usually the first one here.  He's outside smoking when I get here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because he knows we're coming. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  You know, for the first two or three weeks, he was asleep somewhere in the building, because that's what he used to do.  And the door was locked.  And the door was locked, and you would have to ring a doorbell to get into the building.  You're standing out on 57th Street, watching just lowlives walking by, drunk, rapists, murderers, robbers.  Yeah.  And you're sitting there, you're standing there at the side of the building, waiting for this drunk to open the door and save your life.  Mafia guys after they dumped the bodies, you know.  Yeah, who the hell else is out on the streets in Manhattan?  The guy's hosing down the puke off the sidewalks, the garbage men. 
[00:12:30]  And you're sitting there, please?  You're just praying you would ring that doorbell, because this was what happened when we first started.  You ring the doorbell, and you're just praying that he's going to get there sooner than later.  Get here before the killer.  Right, as the dregs of society are walking by you.  Yeah.  Homeless guys.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Frightening.  We got that figured out, though, I guess, so we don't have to ring the doorbell anymore.  And the door is nice and open for us.  Unlocked.  So, yeah, he's kind of an ex-convict with kind of an attitude. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, he's definitely got an attitude.  Well, that's just it.  He's got an attitude unless you treat him properly.  During the time that we've been here, I've realized and figured out how to treat him.  Mm-hmm.  And it is a lot like the soup Nazi.  I have a routine, and I do not break it.  Walk in, hand him the card.  I say, good morning.  He goes, morning.  And then yesterday, I threw something extra in.  Are you crazy?  I know.  Are you nuts?  I don't know why.  I felt like, you know, we've been hitting it off pretty good lately. 
[00:13:30]  So, I just said, pretty cold out there, huh?  And he was like, yeah, yeah.  And then he gave me my card back, and I walked to the elevator.  And that's every morning.  It's just, how you doing?  Good morning.  I sign in.  He gives me my card back.  I'm in.  No problems.  No yelling.  No calling me names.  Well, after the shouting match.  No brettes.  The shouting match I had with him about a month ago, we don't even really make eye contact.  We just acknowledge that we're both assholes.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  Both just not going to ever like each other. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, I just hand over the card.  We understand each other, you know?  Yeah.  And I'll sometimes go, everything was up.  Oh, really?  Sort of, under my breath.  I'm trying to get back in his good graces, but I'm too scared.  So this morning, I got two of those security cards you're talking about, because one didn't  work, so I had to get another one.  This is smart.  Hanging on to both of them.  So now I got two, and I don't know which one works and which doesn't.  And I guess the one that does work, I left home yesterday, because I keep it in my back  pocket, because when we leave the studio to take leaks, we have to go through, you know, 
[00:14:30]  the get smart doors, basically, to go to the bathroom.  It's unbelievable.  You have to have your own key for the bathroom, and then you have to have a security card to  get back into the XM facility here in New York City.  It's ridiculous.  I've been locked out of the studio.  Now I got my own remote control to open up the door.  Look what he's got.  He has a remote control for the front door to XM.  So when you take a leak, why don't you just have your card with you and keep it, like,  in your back pocket?  That's what I did.  Isn't that more convenient than that thing?  Yeah.  Well, this is like a remote control. 
[00:15:00]  That's a remote.  Like, you'd have for maybe a small little stereo or DVD player.  This is a remote control they made in 1988, I think.  Yeah.  The first remote control I got, so I can now get back into the XM facility.  So, yeah.  Well, I keep the card in my back pocket so I can let myself in after the leaks, and I guess  it's in the jeans I was wearing yesterday, because I don't have it today.  So to make a long story short, I, you know, I give him my card that worked for whatever  purposes he needs, and then I go to the elevator, and we can't even get upstairs without, you 
[00:15:30]  know, the security card.  Yeah, you got to swipe your card to even use the elevator.  So I swipe it, thinking nothing of it, like, every morning, I got the wrong card.  It's not working the elevator.  Oh, boy.  You hit the floor button, it doesn't light up.  So now I'm like, this is what happened the last time we had a huge shouting match, me  and him.  Now your options are to go to the guy and say, hey, my card doesn't work, which just  starts a whole big thing. 
[00:16:00]  So I'm in the elevator, just panicking.  I'm starting to, like, have that, my whole body is, like, just panicking, and I'm like,  what am I going to do?  And I'm having this discussion with myself.  I'm like, there might be something I could tell him where he doesn't yell at me, and  then I wouldn't go back.  I'm thinking of a story.  And I'm like, then I remember the stairs that they snuck us out after that really bad  show we had about a month and a half ago when the cops were outside.  Where are those stairs?  You probably can't get up, though.  Do you remember where those stairs were?  I took the elevator that day. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, you did?  I left before you, and I saw, what I saw were people walking in going, do you know what  I just saw coming out of your building?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I saw.  So I was gone before it really got started.  Well, I took the stairs out of the building that day, so now I'm thinking, where are  those stairs?  And I couldn't find them.  You couldn't get up, though.  So now I'm just like, I'm just standing in the elevator just trying to figure out my  options, because I really don't want to have a problem with the guy again, you know?  No.  And so I'm literally sitting there for two minutes, like, what am I going to do?  And then I was about to call Ben and go, Ben, I know this sounds stupid, but can you 
[00:17:00]  come down and get me, because I can't swipe my card in the elevator?  No.  And then all of a sudden, thank God, Eric Sex Bagel slash the Birdman slash Hawk.  Right.  Slash new name coming soon for Sex Bagel.  He finally arrived, and I'm like, dude, you're such my savior today, man.  Thank you.  Don't want to deal with him.  Don't want to deal with the guy.  Just keep it routine every day.  Keep it simple, and everyone will be fine.  Yeah, definitely.  So it was just a whole deal, because you don't want a confrontation with the guy. 
[00:17:30]  No.  Larry from Maryland, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Good morning, Norton.  Hi, Larry.  Hey, you know what?  I'll be honest.  I first called in to tell Opie to start bitching about the security guy, but then I thought  about it.  I listened to your story.  As much shit as you talk about black people, it's kind of funny that you get harassed by  an old black guy every single day of your work.  Dude, the guy's not black.  He's not black.  He's not a black guy.  We never said he was a black guy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  When you said security guard and ex-convict, you know what I mean? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, security, ex-con, and drunk.  Look, even a black guy has stereotypes.  I love it.  Jesus.  Drunk, security guard, ex-convict.  Yeah, I'm thinking black, too, I guess.  Assumed he was black.  No, he's a white guy.  He's a white guy and a nasty one at that.  He looks like nasty like Russian or something, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Like a Russian.  And dude, I'm not bitching at all.  I don't want to have a problem with this guy again, because I don't know.  I hope you put some dioxin in his suit. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I have to look at that every morning.  Well, he already looks like he had the dioxin in his food.  I'm punching out.  You guys are great.  Hurry up and come down to Maryland and D.C. is something.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, my brother.  Norton, you're real, man.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  I don't know why you guys even acknowledge that guy downstairs.  You don't?  If they put a chimp at that desk, I probably wouldn't notice for six weeks.  I don't even look at the creep behind the desk. 
[00:19:00]  I put my thing, sign in, my hand just goes out.  Really?  I don't acknowledge that there was a human being making an exchange with me.  For what?  No cordial little hello?  No.  Maybe some banter about the weather?  I could care less.  You have to have an interaction with the guy, because you have to hand over your security card.  Push it forward.  If there were fetuses falling out of the sky, I wouldn't say, funny weather we're having,  is it?  I don't acknowledge him.  That's why you're a social retard.  No, I'm not.  I know how to be courteous.  I don't like him.  He contributes nothing.  He's a chimp who can speak English if he has to, with an alcoholism. 
[00:19:30]  Well, he's one of these guys, and they're all over New York City especially, you know,  guys that think they have a lot of power, and their job is to do pretty much nothing.  Security.  Yeah.  Security.  What kind of security?  They really are.  And it's this fake security that we've gotten after 9-11.  It's not real security.  These people know nothing.  They don't, they wouldn't know what to do if there was a genuine security risk.  They're there to pretty much roust the employees that come in on a daily basis. 
[00:20:00]  That's it.  They wouldn't know if a terrorist came in, or you get a scene like at a Die Hard, where  the guys come in talking about basketball, and before you know it, the security guy's  getting shot right in the head.  Drag him away and sit at his desk.  They don't know anything.  Yeah, you're right.  It's all fake security since 9-11.  Yes, my friend.  Oh, security card.  Oh, you've got me.  I was going to take over the building, but no, security card? 
[00:20:30]  What do I do now?  You've gotten me.  You have unraveled my plan I have worked on for many years.  By saying, security card, please.  What is that jackass going to do if some Hamas come through the door?  I understand that.  I just want to get past him without any problems.  That's why I take the other tack.  Norton takes the miserable son-of-a-bitch root, hands him the card, doesn't even look at him. 
[00:21:00]  We've been courteous to each other before, but after the stunts he's pulled with you,  he's never been rude to me.  I just don't like him.  I don't like the fact that he's a bully in his own little world with missing teeth.  He's a bully.  I won't acknowledge him.  Well, he got mad at us because we ring the doorbell too many times to get in because,  well, you know, quite frankly, we're a little paranoid and we just want to get in the building  at 4.30.  Oh, I would ring that thing like a scene out of Night of the Living Dead where there's  zombies coming at me.  That's how I'm ringing it.  Kim, let me in!  Please!  Please!  You can't let me in the door, please! 
[00:21:30]  And then he's walking down the long hallway toward the door to let you in and you can  just tell he's just freaking so pissed off.  Tony!  Tony, can't you open your fucking door, Tony?  Tony!  Tony, open the fucking door!  That's what I look like when it's locked out there.  That's great.  I'm petrified.  The scene out on the street is not a fun one.  That is funny, man.  Tony!  Tony!  Please! 
[00:22:00]  Open your fucking door, Tony!  That's Angel Salazar.  He's in the house.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  You got a job, man.  Ernie.  Ernie.  Let's go to the Bronx.  Hey, who's this?  No.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I think I got a theory on why that security guard might be mad at you guys.  Why?  You said before that you used to have to ring the bell, but now the door is open.  Who did you go to to have the door open now when you guys get there?  Because, you know...  No, he's now at his post. 
[00:22:30]  See, the deal was, before we started doing morning radio, he didn't have to let anyone  in at 4.30 in the morning, so he was asleep somewhere in the building.  Right.  Because his bosses weren't around, and then, you know, finally he realized, well, okay,  I got to be at that front desk every morning to let these guys in.  So now, instead of dealing with us ringing the doorbell and there being a confrontation,  he just makes sure the door is unlocked and he's down the long hallway, he sees people  coming into the front door.  Oh, so you guys didn't have to tell anybody?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You snitched on him or something.  No, no, no.  He just had to figure it out. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  You don't like him, huh?  Is that Jimmy talking about the guy down?  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Very nice.  Oh, wow.  Very nice.  And the nominees are.  So that was just a stupid little thing to start the show.  I mean, it wasn't supposed to turn into a big deal, you know?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  And then Ben was telling us in the office as we're getting ready for the show that he's  got a new cleaning lady. 
[00:23:30]  Don't.  He's got a new what?  Cleaning lady.  Oh.  It's like someone's living high on the hog.  So, Ben Tyler Moore, what's this lady like?  Eighteen and a half million dollar apartment, Ben.  I get the $10,000 maintenance.  $10,000 a month in maintenance.  Dude, I'm going to make it after all, dude.  Just throws his hair up in the air.  Dude, Mr. Grant was in Boston, and he was doing coke with Tom Brady.  I wish people could see the herky-jerky when you do the Ben impression. 
[00:24:00]  Ben, I want you to stop herky-ing and jerky in the studio.  No, but he said something that I could relate to because, you know, recently we talked about  it on the show.  I got a Polish maid, cleaning lady, whatever you want to call her.  A chain-smoking Polish maid.  She smokes?  Oh, like a fiend.  Smoke in the house?  No, I'd let her.  I don't give a crap.  You let her smoke in the house?  You let her smoke in the house?  No, I would, but she doesn't.  I don't really care.  Yeah, but you don't care about smoking in your house. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know.  Wow.  Well, Ben has come over.  I go, dude, you can light up your cigars.  I don't care.  I'll just open the windows.  Wow.  That's no big deal.  Well, I guess two ex-smokers and myself are a little more sensitive to it.  Yeah, but Ben brought up a good point in the office because Steve, was it Steve?  It was Steve.  Yeah, Steve came in one day, Martini Steve, with piles of hardcore, the most vile porno  you could imagine for everybody.  That's our Steve.  It's like, Anthony, here's your stack.  Jimmy, here's your stack.  Ben, here's some for you. 
[00:25:00]  Hope, here's some for you.  And we all brought it home, I'm assuming.  Of course we did.  Okay.  Well, I knew my Polish maid was coming over, so I hid everything.  You hid your porno?  I hid everything that would just make me look like an idiot.  The porno.  How does it feel to be a single guy?  The porn magazines.  You know, and you're an adult.  How does it feel that you still have to hide your pornography?  Because we went over this.  You know, when you get a cleaning lady or a maid, you kind of feel like it's your mom.  Like, she's replacing your mom.  Remember the old days when mom would clean up for you? 
[00:25:30]  Because it makes you uncomfortable when you're just sitting there and she's cleaning up.  You feel like maybe you should be doing something or you're going to get yelled at.  Yeah, you feel like at any moment the maid's going to come and scream at you for leaving  your shit-stained underwear on the bathroom floor or whatever.  I'm just going with the most exaggerated example.  But you just think she's going to find you somewhere in your apartment and yell at you  for leaving such a messy apartment.  What am I, your maid?  So before she gets there, I clean up a little bit.  I get rid of the porno and whatever else I have laying around. 
[00:26:00]  But Ben forgot to clean up his porno.  I completely forgot.  And they were like hardcore.  So I was like, oh.  Oh, it's that real.  Do you have some of the throat yogurt series?  Yeah, I mean, I don't even know what I'm ever going to do with this.  Throat yogurt volume one through ten.  Yeah, ass banging.  Mr. Sparks, where would you like your caviar party series?  Brutal.  They got all these, you know, they're just like over-the-top porn.  There's one from like that girl Taylor.  That was like, that's one I'd probably actually watch.  But the rest of these, I'd never watch. 
[00:26:30]  But when I got upstairs, I saw them.  Yeah, Steve's taste in porno is.  He likes the real nasty stuff.  Violent.  He likes the ones where the girl's like beating the chick up.  He likes slap happy.  Oh, I love that guy.  Where the guy is grabbing the girl by the hair and the ears and gagging her on his manhood.  And just smacking her in the face.  And he writes the C word on her head.  And lipstick.  Yeah.  He's a great guy, Brandon.  I don't like those videos.  I love them.  Except.  Too violent.  Sometimes he puts the toilet seat over their head and gives their mouth a good look. 
[00:27:00]  Dude, it's hilarious.  Because he.  Oh, no.  Dude, he puts a toilet seat over their head.  And he just, he holds their head.  And his dick is a wrecking ball.  Oh, God.  And he knows that Brandon is a wreck with that dick.  He's packing probably nine and a half.  He's like Max Hardcore.  But Max has only got like five.  Right.  So Max really has to try to gag him.  But Brandon is an animal.  Who the fuck is Max Hardcore?  Jimmy knows them all.  Max Hardcore?  Max Hardcore?  Max Hardcore?  Dude, he's a legend.  Dude, I just watch porno. 
[00:27:30]  I don't need to know that.  I don't even know that.  He's talking.  He's saying it like George Clooney?  Right, right.  To me, that is.  Well, he's a better actor than Clooney, I think.  Exactly.  No.  Max Hardcore is one of the guys that made the transition.  You know, he helped the business transition from all the straight ahead, you know, filmed  porno to all this gonzo style, really, you know, slap happy kind of stuff.  He was the guy that, he didn't do slap happy.  He did.  Brandon Iron did slap happy.  Cherry poppers.  Cherry poppers.  Cherry poppers.  Of course, Anthony.  Cherry poppers.  I just throw a porno in.  I don't need to know who's who and what kind of style they have. 
[00:28:00]  I need the director's name and I have to know who the people are.  No.  Oh, Max is hilarious.  He's hilarious.  I hate him in porn, too.  Of course.  The rest of the business hates him.  That's so weird.  You guys know the names.  Some of them.  I couldn't name you one porno I've seen.  Really?  I couldn't.  No, I couldn't.  No.  I just watch them.  I don't know any of the girls.  Watch them until you're done.  No, the girls don't last very long in this business.  Just a handful.  But the girls are generally 20-year-old girls who have never done this before and wind up 
[00:28:30]  getting traumatized after three videos.  Oh, yeah.  Especially if they start with Max.  Yeah, exactly.  Max sends them to the hills running.  Yeah.  Oh, Max is an animal.  Sends them off to the convent.  Yeah.  The pep talks they give these girls prior to shooting these things are hilarious because  they say, look, they're these very soft-spoken guys and they sit these girls down and say,  look, this is going to be the worst 20 minutes of your life.  I just want to let you know that.  And then they violate these chicks on video.  Something tells me there was probably a worst 20 minutes that got them to do the porn 
[00:29:00]  on the first place.  Exactly.  No, I'll tell you the worst 20 minutes when I was eight.  Even when they were eight, there's no way they were gagged like Brandon or Max does it.  They puke.  Yeah, and I've seen them vomiting.  And this is the type of stuff that Ben has strewn about his apartment.  Well, it was the stuff that Steve had given me and I was just mortified when I went upstairs  and I looked and piled next to all the CDs.  Yeah, because I'm like, oh, no.  These cleaning ladies, they clean your place like they do at the hotel. 
[00:29:30]  I was sleeping.  They just kind of make everything neat for you.  Neat sleeping.  So she piled up your porno real nice for you, huh?  Yeah.  And it was just, I was like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's like, oh, you're a bachelor, huh?  No, you know, she obviously, you know, she's all, you know, who knows how it is.  It's the same thing.  You're just like, oh, then you feel like such an ass.  You're a bachelor, huh?  So you jack off a lot to this stuff.  She was reading some of those titles.  What do you use these for?  Jacking off?  It was, I mean, the stuff is out of, just the covers of these things that Steve gave us 
[00:30:00]  was just like, I was like, oh.  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah.  So now your maid knows you're a pervert.  It's not a bad name.  And then you're on a diet and apparently like throat yogurt.  Yeah, exactly.  But what's your maid?  How did, what did she look like?  Oh, she was, well, no, I had a different one.  But then thanks to the last company that I worked at and not getting paid for so long,  there was a dispute over money.  So she was hot, Inga.  But then she'd left town anyway.  Inga?  Yeah.  What'd she look like?  Oh, she was hot.  She was tall.  Did she wear a little maid uniform? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was.  Hey, Ben, I'm here today.  I'm Inga.  Did you take a train with Dan Aykroyd?  Yeah, right?  I'm from Sweden.  Oh, yeah.  Right on.  Yesterday's was a very heavy sister.  Oh, really?  A very heavy sister.  A woman of color.  I like big butts and a comfortable bone.  That's just cool.  Yeah.  Cleaning your apartment.  The people I use, occasionally I have my apartment cleaned because I'm a swamp.  Well, I was going to use your guys, but you told me they're like a real  old Asian couple, they don't speak any English.  And I don't know what happened to the woman.  I haven't seen her in a long time.  I guess she retired or she's dead. 
[00:31:00]  But the old guy, he speaks no English, but he just comes in.  That's all he says.  And he lets me write him a check.  I write him a check for cash.  Really?  It's the greatest thing because it's really helped my life because I'm a  slob.  Worth it.  The Polish maid, she doesn't speak English at all.  Really?  Except for little words like, must buy mop.  She once told me.  Must buy mop.  All right, I'll get a mop.  Because they don't bring the cleaning supplies.  You have to have it.  No, you have to have all that.  My guy brings them.  He brings a little basket of them. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, hey.  He pushes.  Hey.  I don't even talk to him.  I always wonder what would happen if I walked up to him and just smashed him in the face  and didn't even acknowledge it.  Because he's so, we just so don't communicate.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  So subservient.  Yeah, he just, you know.  And what do you do while he's cleaning the place?  Because I flick, I'm not even kidding.  I hide.  Whatever room she's in, I go to another room and I just keep moving around.  And she, that's another thing she said.  You don't leave.  You don't leave.  Meaning you don't have to leave while I clean. 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  Because I was on the computer.  I'm like, no, it's okay.  While you do this room, I'm somewhere else now, man.  Norton pops in platoon and laughs hysterically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  You see that fucking cleaning supplies come apart, man?  That's the way to go clean.  So what do you do?  She's the one that did Manny's apartment.  I, uh, I'll just, I'll take a case of a light of a cigar and flick an ash and make him catch it before it hits the floor.  Ahem.  Harf.  Or sometimes if I want the bedroom clean first, if I want to take a nap, I'll, he doesn't know. 
[00:32:30]  I'll just bring him to the bedroom, he'll clean that first, then I'll nap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  I pay the guy.  All right.  Do they say, and I don't do no flaws, that's a man's wake.  I'm not that, I'm just a slob, but it's just clutter.  It's not dirt.  I just, I gotta have a clean.  Staten Island, what's up?  What bitches we sound like.  I know.  What's up, bro?  Bitches.  Hey, hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, man.  Um, oh, help me out with something here. 
[00:33:00]  I'm trying to figure this out.  Sure.  Um, you, um, said basically that you're kind of like a minimalist,  and you barely have a lot of stuff in your apartment.  Right.  Um, and that you clean before the Polish maid gets there.  Well, not, I don't really clean clean, I just kind of straighten up a little bit.  Like, I make sure my stupid underwear is not laying around on the, on, on the bathroom floor.  And I make sure the porno is, uh, not, not visible.  That's another thing, that you're, you're kind of like embarrassed if she finds your own stuff.  I mean, like, why are you paying this person to come into your place if you have so much, 
[00:33:30]  it seems like there's more work than extra.  Dude, she's still scrubbing and sweeping and vacuuming and mopping.  It's pretty much to keep the piss off the bowl.  Yeah, that's it.  Pretty much why a guy hires a maid.  That's, everything else is fine.  Yeah.  Guys just don't want to clean their toilets.  And if you have a girl over, it's really bad to have, like, hair and piss on the toilet seat.  I got whizzed on the outside of my toilet seat.  I don't know where, how I'm, like, after you, after you whack your bag and you got a whizz, 
[00:34:00]  it sprays out all over the place.  I got it.  Like a fire hose.  I'm going the other night and it's dark and I'm not hearing it hit the water and I realize  it's spraying over the, over the bowl because the lights are out.  Taking a left turn and hitting the wall.  I've done that.  I have an object on the floor.  It's hitting that and I'm like, ugh.  So I got to sleep down and clean like it all over the back of my knuckles.  No, you know, I explained this when we were talking about this last time.  I don't feel worthy enough to have a maid because I grew up really, really poor and my 
[00:34:30]  mom was on my case to keep everything clean all the time.  So I just, it just brings me back.  Like, I feel like my mom's in my place and she's going to yell at me for leaving crap  laying around and I don't know.  It's just a weird thing that goes way back.  Hobson, where did you put my pornography?  Hobson, I'm looking for throat yogurt.  Volume 4.  Do you think he wants a piece of caviar?  Bitterman, would you jerk me off while I watch this movie, please? 
[00:35:00]  He's taking his dick out of his pants.  You think he's going to whack his bag?  Oh, but that awful, ugh.  What's her name?  Liza Minnelli.  I just saw that recently.  She kind of ruined that movie.  That movie's brilliant.  I mean, he was brilliant in that movie.  For some reason, it wasn't as bad when it came out, like Liza Minnelli being in there,  but now in hindsight, watching it again, you're just like, oh, she's not believable in that role.  I don't like your drinking, Arthur. 
[00:35:30]  You should have said that to your mother, Liza.  Oh, yeah, the father.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a hilarious movie.  She was okay.  I just feel like the moon was falling.  Hobson, I'm all herky and jerky here.  Just don't misplace Steve's pornography.  And don't fucking Arthur, he said she was a hooker lad in the restaurant and fucking  psycho-marked with you. 
[00:36:00]  Teeny cell phone.  Fuck, I said, Rhode Island can keep the crap out of it in a war.  God, I love your better impression.  I hope people get that, because you nailed him in.  You got him down.  Little teensy phone.  All right, well, why don't we take our first break?  We got Triple H coming in today, our old friend.  Good.  That'll be fun.  We could talk to him about China's snatch.  I disagree.  What the hell's growing out of it?  I disagree with some of his workout techniques, too, in the book. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, I'm going to discuss a few things with him.  A lot of pictures in that book, I noticed.  Yeah, it's less words.  Less words, more gooder.  More gooder?  More gooder.  All right.  Why don't we play Brother Joe's Christmas song?  Oh, yeah.  Brother Joe's got a brand new Christmas song, and we were talking about porno and stuff,  so I think this fits here perfectly.  Sure.  Spank your bag.  Spank your bag. 
[00:37:00]  Well, the tip, it's a-glistening.  Hey there, hands, are you listening?  I'll pretend you're a chick, whacking my dick, while I'm jerking off with my left hand.  Oh, my balls, I will tickle, as I yank on my pickle.  It felt so good, stroking my wood, while I was jerking off with my left hand. 
[00:37:30]  Here's another trick that I would use, man, to make it special when I'd want to come.  I'd fall asleep while lying on my arm and whack it when my hand was nice and numb.  Tricks I'd learned in my teen years got me through all those lean years.  My hand was my whore, but I'd pretend it was more, while I was jerking off with my left hand. 
[00:38:00]  While I was jerking off with my left hand.  While I was jerking off with my left hand.  While I was jerking off with my left hand.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Back, way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois. 
[00:38:30]  I believe it was WRCW, not sure of the call letters, 1590 day timer.  Signed off at sunrise, sunset rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  This holiday season, what are you giving your sports fanatical dad?  Your country music loving mom?

It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  I'm Chuck Devine.  And winter's made a big splash in the Northeast. 
[00:42:00]  Andy Davis took it all in at Stowe in northern Vermont.  If you know Stowe, you know being able to ski part of the famous front four means winter has arrived.  Lifeline and National had plenty of loose powdery snow thanks to a big early week dumping of powder.  The easier Lord Run from the Forerunner Quad, that made for a good run in the sun to wrap up my afternoon.  Looking for winter?  From the Stowe Village right up to Mount Mansfield, Stowe's got it.  Sunday River, Maine with 23 miles of pack powder.  They'll ski from all eight peaks this weekend.  Jiminy Peak, Massachusetts have more than 200 snow guns going overnight. 
[00:42:30]  Ten trails there.  Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia, five inches of fresh powder opening their terrain park and snow tubing this weekend.  Breckenridge, Colorado with more than 1,000 acres and 50% of their terrain.  Sun Valley, Idaho, America's original year-round destination resort, announces new daily non-stop flights from the west.  Visit sunvalley.com.  I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  A.B. and Anthony, XM202.  Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, cause we need a little controversy, cause it feels so empty without me. 
[00:43:00]  Last album, not that good for Slim Shady, huh?  What happened?  It's not that good, his last album.  Uh, yeah.  Not like the huge hits that the previous two were, that's for sure. 
[00:43:30]  That was good.  Lost a little steam.  I liked Lose Yourself, though, from the 8 Mile soundtrack.  You can buy his studio.  Did you see that on the news?  Oh, I know.  People that sell the houses that someone was born in and studios that they did work in.  It looked like a shithole.  Where, in Detroit or here?  Detroit.  Detroit.  They're selling the, uh, recording studio where Eminem became famous.  That's what I want to do.  Buy property in Detroit.  Ooh. 
[00:44:00]  Set it on fire.  Get more money from the insurance.  It was a dump.  What's wrong, Norton?  My eggs are cold.  Of course they are.  Look at what we're in.  We're in a refrigerator.  You got them 40 minutes ago, too.  But I'll be.  You gotta wolf that down a little quicker.  I don't want to eat in the air.  I got yelled at someone.  Someone.  Everything's like granite in here.  I say, this place is like a mausoleum.  Yeah.  We gotta, I think we, I think we need to start broadcasting from our office.  I know.  Our office is so nice and colorful.  Now the office is finally done. 
[00:44:30]  We love hanging out in there.  Now we're not happy with the studio.  I know.  Now we're not happy with the studio.  Well, we have a conference call today with Kevin, so let's see.  They'll get right on it.  And by June 4th, we should have some heat in here.  I don't know what we're gonna do with the heat problem, because I think it's a building  issue.  We're gonna be here with, like, kerosene heaters and starting fires.  Uh, we'll just hang Steve's clothes all around the studio.  We'll be fine.  That old gag.  Jeremy in Kansas.  What's up, Jeremy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just had to say, when Jimmy busted that one out on those girls yesterday, those little 
[00:45:00]  crazy bitches.  Oh, the Apprentice girls had to smell Jim's farts yesterday.  That was really funny.  Oh, yeah.  That was funny.  Thank you.  The one, um, Ivana, I guess?  Yeah, Ivana.  That one?  Ivana, yeah.  Ivana.  She, uh, she tried to make like she didn't hear Jimmy's fart.  It was so loud.  There was no missing it.  And it sounded wet.  It was like, ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff.  And these are the girls, the type of girls you just don't fart in front of. 
[00:45:30]  You know what I mean?  No, no.  And she didn't miss a beat.  She kept talking, like, right through it.  And I knew she heard it.  She was trying to be a professional about it.  But she started to nudge over to the other girl.  Yeah.  And then we had to acknowledge it.  It was really funny.  They were much nicer than I thought they were going to be.  I thought they were going to be awful.  Hold on.  That kind of ruined it.  Yeah, they turned out to be really cool.  Yeah, because we got slammed on the email.  Why didn't you guys, you know, rip into them?  They were nice, dude.  They were nice, and they actually handled themselves well.  And they gave us OK radio and the whole exchange with Gene Simmons.  I thought it was all right.  So we didn't go after them. 
[00:46:00]  You can't just slam somebody if they're being nice and there's no reason for it.  Then you look like a dick.  It's like, for what?  Yeah, if they were being nasty, we would have laid into them.  But they were being nice and kind of wrecked it.  That gasser, I really thought, would send things in a bad tone.  I was trying to push that out, but I was waiting for a quiet moment.  Yeah.  And then nothing.  The one who's like, I think he's lactose intolerant.  She wanted to help.  They took your fart like they were champs.  That could have turned the interview, and then we could have went after them.  But after they smell your fart and they're cool about it, what are we going to do after that? 
[00:46:30]  I dropped two of them.  The second one's when she finally commented.  Yeah.  Jeremy, what else do you have today?  Thank you.  I was wondering if you guys were going to give any more my fives out.  Because the one chance I had, Master Poe couldn't hit the broad side of the barn.  Oh, that's right, when we played the cherry darts.  Yeah, we're giving away a MiFi tomorrow.  Are you tomorrow?  Yeah, we're doing our whole eggnog drinking contest tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  What are you going to do for the listeners to try and win?  I don't know.  We might figure something out. 
[00:47:00]  Maybe we'll have some of the eggnog drinking contestants represent some of you guys all over America again.  There you go.  All right, we'll figure it out tomorrow.  Master Poe doesn't get to play.  No, no, no.  None of us are going to be drinking eggnog until we puke.  I know.  What a grudge this guy can hold.  Well, if Master Poe could have hit the bullseye with the cherry dart, that guy would have had a MiFi.  A bunch of other people didn't either, you know?  And they're not calling every day.  Absolutely, except the guy from Buffalo calls to thank me, as he should. 
[00:47:30]  Where's my call, shithead?  But tomorrow we give away another MiFi, the portable XM satellite radio.  It's all the rage this holiday season.  It really is an unbelievable thing.  And I'm hearing a lot of the stores are sold out in the damn thing.  Yeah, very hard to get.  It's like the item this Christmas.  So tomorrow it's the eggnog drinking contest.  We're asking our fine listeners to show up at the station.  And we'll pick ten contestants.  Come on up here and participate in the eggnog drinking contest.  Which is what, Anthony?  They have to drink two ounces of eggnog every minute until they puke or have to take a leak. 
[00:48:00]  And once that happens, they're out of the competition.  And then the last man standing, or girl, if we get one of those in here for this contest, yeah, that's going to happen.  And the last one standing, wins.  Wins the MiFi.  If you don't puke or wet yourself.  Right.  And a lot of people are concerned about the wetting themselves thing.  Why are they concerned? 
[00:48:30]  They're like, you shouldn't let the contestants leave the studio to take a leak because that's anti-climatic.  All of a sudden, like, hey, I'm out.  I've got to take a leak.  It's not as fun as seeing these guys puke, which is kind of true.  Well, what if they take a leak and then the guy goes in there and puts his finger down his throat?  Right, exactly.  So I guess the contestants...  He'd be out anyway.  The contestants have to stay within our vision for the entire contest.  That's it.  And we're asking you guys to bring down food once again for Steve. 
[00:49:00]  I still don't get it.  He started the food thing, so...  Then we get loads of...  Did we have leftover food from last time?  Yeah, we did.  What do we do with it?  Do we throw it out?  No, everyone was eating it around here.  The rest of the office, all those guys.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, so that goes down tomorrow for the MiFi, all right?  Oh, the guy at the door ought to be happy about this one.  I know.  He loves when there's people waiting in a line out front of the place, smoking and drinking,  and he's got to sweep up, and he's all pissed. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, good.  Just do your job, you cranky drunk.  Worry about your liver.  I don't know if he's a drunk.  Don't talk to Ben like that.  You're not here in the studio.  You're waiting until a commercial break or something.  Dude, I have a haircut like Damien from the Almanove.  Martini Steve was also telling me that we're going to be able to bring some other listeners  up here to just check out the contest.  Oh, really?  Like Death Row?  Yeah.  Where we put on an execution.  They'll be outside the glass in the chairs? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  We'll do that.  I like the fact that we have to cover the windows with the New York Times if boobs pop  out, but a bunch of guys puking, we won't have to cover.  No, no.  That's fair game.  That's fair game, right.  So with 10 contestants and maybe another 15 people to check out the mess, all right?  Mm-hmm.  That goes down tomorrow on the O&A show.  Sounds like fun.  And some feedback coming in, Anthony.  David from Palm Springs, California.  Guys, I couldn't get in on the FU line, so I will say this here.  I'd like to give a whopping horse dick fuck you to all those politically correct bastards 
[00:50:30]  out there who say that we can't say Merry Christmas anymore.  Yes.  Just before he came in, I was watching CNN, and they had a whole thing about this.  I guess the Macy's right here in New York City, they're not allowed to say Merry Christmas  to their shoppers anymore.  They have to say Happy Holidays.  Happy Holidays.  Because Merry Christmas is offending a lot of people out there.  Not a lot of people out there.  Once again, a small, small group of people that shop are being offended by the fact that  the sales clerk is saying Merry Christmas instead of Happy Holidays or Happy Kwanzaa or whatever 
[00:51:00]  the hell they're celebrating these days.  The left is who's being offended.  Just say it.  The left.  We have to be all-inclusive.  Yes.  And nothing is special to anybody.  It has to be ladled out in some bland mess to everybody.  Nothing special, nothing too fun for one group or one people, even though everyone can enjoy  it.  You can't have that.  You've got to knock it down to make everyone feel equal and the same. 
[00:51:30]  Ugh.  You want to smack these people in the head.  Growing up, I don't know, I remember Christmas.  I remember Merry Christmas.  Lights, spelling it out.  Displays, you go to the stores.  Christmas trees everywhere.  Merry Christmas written down.  Now, no.  It's got to be generic.  You can't have Christmas trees.  It's got to be Happy Holiday displays.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:52:00]  Why do we have to suffer because we invented this damn thing?  We did?  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I invented Christmas, Robert.  I was the first one.  Before me.  You can't mention religion at all.  No, I'm just saying, I mean, you know, it's such a, we kind of, whatever.  But the Catholics, Christians, the people that worship Jesus.  Right.  There you go.  That pretty much covers it.  The people that see Jesus as their Lord. 
[00:52:30]  If it wasn't for us, there wouldn't be a holiday season.  Right.  That Hanukkah thing didn't really seem to be taken off.  Not at all.  They kind of looked, they looked in their books to try to figure out how they could capitalize on the whole Christmas thing.  The whole Christmas thing.  The Jewish people.  Well, we're going to celebrate lights.  What?  The festival of lights.  What?  We light a candle every night already.  Too much work.  Yeah.  Too much to remember.  Or, yeah, Jewish people.  And most Jewish people I know, they throw the Christmas tree in their house. 
[00:53:00]  Of course they do.  Because they really just want to celebrate Christmas.  Everyone understands how fun and exciting Christmas is, especially growing up as a child.  You love it.  You love having the tree and the presents under the tree, the whole thing, Santa Claus, and the stockings, and the fireplace, all that stuff.  And then everyone tries to jump on the bandwagon.  The Jewish people with the Hanukkah just doesn't quite cut it. 
[00:53:30]  You get one gift a night or something, and one of them's a dreidel.  It just points out how much their holidays suck, and that's why they don't like Christmas.  Their holidays are boring and terrible.  That's what it is.  I think it comes down to jealousy.  So they kind of make a stink about it.  The black people with the Kwanzaa.  That just isn't taking off, my brothers.  I'm sorry.  And what the hell is Kwanzaa?  I've been trying to figure this out for years.  It was invented in, like, the 60s.  You can't have a holiday that's just invented in the 60s. 
[00:54:00]  This stuff needs to be steeped in tradition.  You can't start wishing people happy Kwanzaa.  And the problem, here's the problem.  The only time it's okay to mention religion in schools is if you're telling your class how peaceful Islam is, and it's sickening.  That's the only time they allow religion to be talked about is if you're defending Islam.  Yeah.  Well, you know, guys, Islam is violent because of the behavior of everyone in it.  Everyone.  Now, Jim, I think those are just a few bad apples that you're eating.  You just stuff your face throughout the whole show every morning. 
[00:54:30]  What am I supposed to do?  It's not distracting.  I don't care.  It's just another thing they're taking away from us, though.  In your act, you talk about Mother's Day and how they don't celebrate it in school anymore.  I forgot about that joke.  Of course, the gays fought that because it's not all-inclusive Mother's Day cards.  There's a lot of schools.  What if a kid has two daddies at home?  A lot of schools have taken away Mother's Day and Father's Day.  Well, Father's Day is in the summer, I guess.  But Mother's Day, you know, celebrating that in the schools. 
[00:55:00]  Because it's not inclusive.  Well, they've replaced it, actually, from Mother's Day to sorry that your parents' sexual choices are embarrassing you in front of the other students' day.  You fucking self-centered idiots.  I want you to lock helmets and dock for a while while your son cries, wondering why you're not like any other family he knows.  You fucking stop trying to assimilate and force everyone to see it your way.  You want to blow each other?  Good for you.  But stop force-feeding the rest of us, you drivel. 
[00:55:30]  I don't care.  Gay people should be able to have partner benefits.  Fine.  You want to blow the same guy forever?  You got the benefit of being a guy and not being married.  But you want to tie yourself into the same cock and balls forever?  That's your business, stupid.  I got to agree with you on that one.  I got no problem with that.  And it's true.  Instead of just working on getting your own crap together, all these groups have to knock down what the majority of people are doing to try to make themselves seem more accepted. 
[00:56:00]  And it doesn't mean that your rights have to be infringed on if you're the minority group.  I'm not saying that the majority should be right and you should get nothing.  But look, sorry, Christmas is something we celebrate.  It doesn't mean that you can't celebrate Kwanzaa or Hanukkah.  All those things should be celebrated.  But just like you said, to ladle it down and to take anything.  Yeah.  Make it dull and boring and all-inclusive and nothing special.  You can't have anything special to one group of people or else everyone gets upset. 
[00:56:30]  Who's getting upset?  It's just a tiny portion of society.  That's what bothers me.  They make the big stink.  Yep.  They make the big stink.  But you say everybody.  It's not everybody.  It's small groups.  No one's getting upset that people that are told not to say, you know, Merry Christmas anymore.  It is.  It's small groups that get upset.  And the news loves this stuff.  They pick up on it.  And all of a sudden, before you know it, they're not saying Merry Christmas anymore.  They're not celebrating Mother's Day in school. 
[00:57:00]  Mother's Day.  Yeah, because that's real offensive.  That's...  And you have to have a mother, by the way, you sissies.  You have to.  Whether or not you're married or you're living an alternative lifestyle, the kid has a mother somewhere.  The kid has a father.  Sorry, that's the way nature set it up.  Came out of a snatch somewhere.  Absolutely.  Even though now he's living with two daddies.  But, you know, you can't do that because my son will feel excluded.  Oh, like when you and the other fuck are walking hand-in-hand in the park, he doesn't feel excluded? 
[00:57:30]  You ever notice that your kid hangs 14 yards behind you, looking at the ground, kicking his feet in the dirt, pretending he doesn't know?  You two are so proud of yourself, you midlife crisis.  I don't like pussy anymore.  Me neither.  God, that irritates me.  Only because it's like forcing the smaller percentages will on the rest of the people.  Again, I don't even care if gay people adopt.  That's fine. 
[00:58:00]  There's plenty of bad straight parents.  Just gay people aren't going to fuck it up anymore than straight people have with abuse.  So that's fine.  If you want to adopt kids, take them.  I hate kids.  They're yours.  But just stop bellyaching.  I agree with you.  But maybe the children are brought up in healthy homes that way.  Maybe.  Some of them might be.  I'm sure there's plenty of...  Look, I love my parents, but there's plenty of straight families I saw that were atrocious.  And if I had to have two gay guys who had interest in the Guggenheim, you know, lived on Fifth Avenue, yeah, I'd go with them.  Who cares if they creep in and put a digit in? 
[00:58:30]  So what?  They're probably both making $400,000 a year.  You take it.  Living large.  Wow.  Will in Denver, what's up?  Hey, not much, guys.  All right.  Good show this morning.  I was wanting to point out, you know, all the minorities really get pissed off about things and say, well, you've got to please us.  And I look at it as, hey, we're the majority.  You have the right to not like it, but we have the right to tell you to shut the hell up and deal with it. 
[00:59:00]  Well, the majority is a bunch of pussies because, you know, we just all allow this to happen.  We don't really...  It's too much apathy, just like you all have said in the past.  Yeah, I mean, we just...  I mean, we take it, you know?  Yeah.  Too busy.  Too busy trying to make a living and put food on the table for your family.  And for the big picture, it's not really that important to everybody.  If you look at the big picture of your life and just trying to, you know, make enough money to raise your family, it's not that big a deal. 
[00:59:30]  And then you sit down and think about it and it gets you pissed off, but you're not writing letters.  So they'll always have the upper hand, those small little groups that want to make a big stink about it.  And the problem is the majority is a guilt complex because for many years, the majority did kind of smash, you know, the minority in a lot of ways, whether it was blacks or women.  I mean, they were treated horribly.  So it's like now in cases where there is no horrible treatment, the majority can't just go, look, shut the fuck up with that.  They go, oh, all right, we're sorry, we're sorry.  Yeah.  It's like every little case is brought up now. 
[01:00:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like instead of just having a balance, now they're just caving in with everything and it's really irritating.  Hey, Jim makes a good point on the phones.  Jim from Jersey.  No, Jim from Jersey.  Oh, you're from Jersey too, yeah.  Jim, on the phone, shut the fuck up.  Jim.  What's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Listen, Christmas is a national holiday.  Why can't they say Merry Christmas?  That's stupidity.  Well, it's just, it's the bosses at these department stores.  It's, you know, it's not like an edict has come down from Washington. 
[01:00:30]  You know, you're not allowed to say Merry Christmas anymore.  It will.  So we should stop shopping at Macy's and I know I'm going to hit the wall with this next  question, but, uh, Opie, how's your headache?  Oh, I dumped like a, like a racehorse this morning, man.  I was lit.  Did your tail come up and slowly green apples came falling out?  I told Anthony, I walked in about, uh, we tried to get here around five a little before  and I was late and I'm like, Ant, I'm late, but I took care of all the problems from yesterday. 
[01:01:00]  Took care of business.  All morning, just over.  I did, uh, I did, uh, four dumps in one hour.  Ooh.  All massive.  It all decided to come out.  It must have been stinging.  So I don't have colon cancer, you assholes.  I bet it was just an awful pile that comes up out of the water.  Oh.  One of those thick, horrible piles.  There was barely water at one point.  Really?  It was displaced by what was coming out.  You take a dump and think, oh, the maid's going to have some trouble with this. 
[01:01:30]  Cleaning up under the rim.  I know.  I knew the maid was coming.  I'd do it on the bathroom floor and then point out.  Now clean it up.  I know our listeners mean well, but one guy's like, I think he has colon cancer.  Another guy's like, you know, my grandma had the same problem and she didn't take a dump for three months.  And the day that she was going to have an operation to get it all removed, she died from the toxins.  Oh, boy.  I didn't take a dump for like two days.  That's it.  Yeah, you're fine.  Relax.  And I know why because I figured out I got this stupid cereal that's, you know, lots of fiber and protein. 
[01:02:00]  It's pretty much, I said it yesterday.  It's like.  You slicks.  It's like eating little twigs and little dirt bombs.  Yeah.  Literally.  But it's kind of flavorful.  And one morning I was really hungry.  So it's not like Captain Crunch where you could eat the whole box and you're not going to have a problem.  Having medicine for breakfast?  Dude, I will bring in this box of cereal tomorrow.  You guys will laugh at me.  I don't know.  So I was hungry one morning and I'm eating and eating like two or three bowls of this stuff.  Yeah.  That's what happened. 
[01:02:30]  I was making cement.  Like a cement mix of your stomach.  Taking a cast of your intestine.  Yeah.  So back to normal today.  Keith, what's going on?  Oh, the problem with all of this and society in general today is, you know, as long as I'm a minority  and I've got a half-baked cause, the liberal media is going to back me and I'm going to get what I want.  Because the average Joe walking down the street has just adopted a lazy attitude of, 
[01:03:00]  hey, I don't care.  They can do whatever they want.  I'm going to buy into whatever they say.  Yeah, the minority is definitely much more proactive than the majority.  And that's the problem in this country.  I mean, we discover that in our stupid radio careers.  You know, you get one guy or one tiny little group complaining about your radio show and the company will shut you down  because they get all paranoid and scared.  They get all scared because it's one group.  We just read the other day that 99, over 99% of all the complaints that came into the FCC were from one group. 
[01:03:30]  That parents...  Yeah, parents, teachers, parents, television council.  Yeah, parents, television council.  That's our society today.  Yeah, but you can't blame the liberal media.  As much as I hate the liberal media, it's conservatives to any special interest group has got that, whether they're left or right.  They're just repulsive.  Awful.  Hey, I'm punching out.  All right, fella.  Thank you, Keith.  They're all self-centered pigs of special interest groups.  Speaking of the FCC, they're going to leave satellite radio alone, which we told you guys a month, month and a half ago. 
[01:04:00]  Some idiot station owner in L.A.  It's all about press releases.  This guy wanted to get his name in the paper.  He's like, well, I'm going to demand that the FCC, you know, regulate satellite radio.  The same way it regulates broadcast, yeah.  Right, so then there was a big stink, and of course the stupid news has to pick up on it.  Oh, my God, are they going to regulate satellite radio?  We told you guys a month and a half ago, no fucking way are they going to regulate satellite radio. 
[01:04:30]  Saul Levine, who owns three radio stations in California.  Saul.  That's the guy.  Right.  They're going to injure my income, satellite takeaway, my listeners.  But just the nerve of this guy, because commercial radio, you faggots have buckled and allowed it to be ruined by special interest.  Now satellite's a place, and you want nobody to be able to enjoy that entertainment?  Right.  Oh, my goodness.  The fucking self-centeredness of people in this country is sickening.  Because his stations are going to have to adhere to FCC regulations. 
[01:05:00]  He wants everybody to just hear what the FCC deems entertaining.  Well, he gave the option of maybe the FCC can relax the regulations.  Yeah, because that's going to happen.  How about this, cunt?  Why don't you stop being such a slave to the advertising dollars and stand up for yourself?  Never.  Never going to happen.  God, does that make me nauseous.  They're all running scared in regular radio.  So we're safe here, and we knew we'd be safe here.  And we sit here off the coast, broadcasting in, and there's nothing they could do about it.  I don't even think they want to do anything about it.  As long as it's a pay service, fine. 
[01:05:30]  And the guy's like, well, you could pick it up in a rental car.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, God.  I'm going to strangle that douchebag.  Was that what he was saying?  Oh, yeah.  What he was saying?  Like a family could be in a rental car, turn on XM, and all of a sudden they're going to hear something offensive.  Exactly.  Well, how about this?  You marry into it with a guy who can afford his own car and doesn't have to rent everywhere.  Or maybe you do what Opie and Anthony do and take limousines.  We don't take limousines, you ass. 
[01:06:00]  And have Polish maids.  I was wondering what Opie and Anthony he was talking about.  Dude, my Polish maid costs nothing.  She's desperate for money.  Slave labor?  It's pretty much slave labor.  I give her a really good tip because it's ridiculous how much money they want for her to come over.  So that guy actually helped Satellite without meaning to because now it's confirmed they're doing nothing about it.  Thank you, stupid.  They're not going to regulate it.  There you have it.  Paul from Long Island.  What's up, Paul?  Yeah, it's the fucking ACLU.  They're another big fucking group. 
[01:06:30]  They are irritating.  Yeah, and like, I don't know if you guys...  Wait, the ACLU is all for regulating Satellite Radio?  No.  No, Opie.  We're going backwards to what's the ACLU responsible for this time?  The ACLU, I think, man, used to be such a great organization fighting for black voting rights and all these things like against police brutality. 
[01:07:00]  Things that were really going on.  And the country has changed a lot.  They won't acknowledge it's changed, so they're becoming increasingly irrelevant by nitpicking.  And it takes away from their real causes.  I respect the fact that they'll fight for the Klan and awful groups like that to be able to march.  They don't just fight for liberal causes.  Yeah.  I don't know if you guys have a listener to Stag Michael Savage, but he talks about time.  Yeah, I mean, he's a bright guy and he does a good show, but again, he's probably a little too conservative for me. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, but I'm glad he just makes a lot of people aware of it.  Yeah.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Well, you're right.  The ACLU is kind of getting on my nerves.  Thank you to Paul.  Let's go to Kevin in Michigan, it looks like.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I listened to you during that free week.  Yeah.  And I subscribed to you, and you guys rock.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Opie and Anthony, you guys are called Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  You are the backbone of the show, buddy.  Oh.  No, sorry.  I am but one little vertebrae in the spine of this radio disaster we call a show.  No, I've never seen you before, but I picked you about as big around as you are tall, so you're built just about like me. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, boy.  Why?  Are you a fatso?  Oh, yeah.  I got big fat man tits and everything else, you know.  Say it slower.  Hey, keep up the good work, guys.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  Spread the virus to others for us, all right?  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Time to give you some sex on the show today.  What?  It's time to give you some sex on the show today. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, you want some sex on the show today?  Well, I got a hot wow story for you from yesterday.  All right.  We, yeah, we've been in a sex slump lately.  We haven't had any couples try to become the sexiest state in America.  We haven't had a queef.  People are requesting that a girl calls up and queefs for us.  We haven't done that in a while.  We haven't played Guess What's in My Pants.  So we'll try to get something sexy on the show today.  All right, ladies.  Maybe Bernie Kerrick could call in and tell us how he'd bang a chick out the window facing 
[01:09:00]  ground zero.  Nice job, stupid.  Oh, yeah.  Is that the latest?  Well, no, just the fact that his apartment was facing ground zero, they were saying that  they would bang this chick in.  Oof.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, good job by the president.  Hold on, bro.  I actually, look, as much as I think this is ridiculous because he would have been great  for this job, he would have been perfect for this job.  Yeah.  The conservatives, you guys brought it on yourselves, man.  You know, you want to walk around like you're the moral police with a lot of shit.  Well, look what happens.  When stuff like this happens, yeah.  The other side's going to pounce. 
[01:09:30]  And then you went after Bernie Kerrick and he was one of your own.  Go ahead, Eric.  Yeah, hey, yesterday I was heading up to Denver from Colorado Springs.  Yeah.  And I came up on this car and a chick that was in the passenger seat, she had one of those  like jumpsuit type skirts.  And when I looked down, I could see she had some really nice legs.  And she turned and looked at me, saw I was checking her out.  She pulled her skirt down and her husband intentionally slowed her down to get away from me. 
[01:10:00]  She said to her, well, a few minutes later, they sped up and were right beside me.  And I glanced over.  She had unhooked the top of her jumpsuit, pulled it down, taken her top off, and unhooked  her bra and just turned her seat and gave me a total, I mean, total view.  She sat there like that for probably 10 minutes.  Nice.  That is so hot when that stuff happens on the highway. 
[01:10:30]  I don't know what size she was, but oh, man, I bought one off the road.  Awesome.  Well, if you want to participate in WOW, you can get a WOW bumper sticker by going to opianthony.com,  all right?  It does happen.  What are you doing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Steve's next to you.  You're getting a little warm there.  Now it's warmer in here.  Yeah, it is.  It's Ron in Philly.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I wonder what my kind of dog Chester was, what he looked like. 
[01:11:00]  Because I'm making a game called Chester Reloaded, where you have to reenact events and get  it perfectly.  Wow, you're breaking up.  There's so many phones that clip when they're calling this radio show.  Crap.  Ron, you're making a Chester Reloaded Flash game?  Yes.  What's going to be the object?  Well, the object is to try to reenact events that happen quickly, you know, not to kick  the dog too hard.  Oh, I got you.  Wait, I...  Just like the JFK game.  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to reenact exactly what happened. 
[01:11:30]  You know, what kind of thing he was in college, did you make it, you know, to reenact it perfectly?  So what you're saying is, you would get points taken off if, let's say, you kicked Chester  in the liver before Chester ate the steak.  Yeah.  Prime rib.  The prime rib.  Or if you kick him too hard or in the wrong place.  Right.  You can't kick him in the head.  Yeah.  And you can't kick him so hard that you kill him, but you have to kick him hard enough  that he can no longer get up the steps.  Right.  Exactly.  Okay.  A flow death.  That's funny.  Don't forget that the TV tray has to end up sideways on the floor. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Yeah.  With the prime rib on the dog hair covered rug.  Rug, right.  Yeah.  Was there a magic footprint that kind of went through Chester and around and hit his arm,  but it's impossible because it was from the other side?  I believe there could be little doggy prints in the mashed potatoes that were now on the  rug.  Oh.  And I do believe there was a cat involved that was lapping up the gravy.  Why don't we call it the mashy potatoes? 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  We can have all of the game.  I didn't even know what he looked like.  I believe the kick came from the mashy potatoes.  The book.  Tray table, sir.  All right, Ron.  Good luck with the game.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  All right.  Man, the phones have exploded today.  Mark in Oklahoma City.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Bubbles.  Hello, Jamie Gumm.  Bubbles.  How are you?  I like that.  Hey, what happened to the good old days when the faggots stayed in the closet? 
[01:13:00]  We got bored and we'd go over and drag them behind our pickup truck.  Oh.  Well, sir.  Gotta love the calls from Oklahoma.  Punch it out.  Love you guys.  Punch it out.  Bye, fella.  All right, there you go.  They never really did drag gay people behind trucks.  No.  To be honest with you.  I believe one was tied to a fence.  Matthew Shepard.  Yes.  I believe that a gentleman dragged a black man behind a truck.  Yes.  Getting the grease man fired.  His name was Bert, I believe.  Waddledoodle.  Waddledoodle.  Marion, what's up? 
[01:13:30]  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Marion.  Of the retarded Laverne and Shirley on the phone.  Yes, the employed half.  I wanted to wish you guys a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Thank you.  We don't say Merry Christmas on this show.  We say Happy Holidays.  Well, it doesn't matter.  Whatever, whatever.  Because I'm not going to be able to get a chance to get up there.  Why?  Oh, really?  Oh.  Why?  Why, Marion?  Because I wanted to come up tomorrow, but Diane seems to not have any money.  Oh.  Well, you could come up without her because she's going to be dead soon anyway, and you're  going to have to move on with your life. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, come on.  Don't say she's going to be dead.  Why don't you help old Chester live her out and give her some sort of a cat fair?  She's not even trying.  We already said that.  That's why we gave up on her.  We set her up with a guy that was going to get her into rehab, and even that guy gave up.  I know he did.  And those guys don't give up.  I know he did.  He don't even call me.  He used to call me and talk.  We don't even call him.  He don't even call me anymore.  And her phone was shut off, right?  It's still on.  Wow.  It's still on.  I don't know how it's still on, but it's still on. 
[01:14:30]  No, it's fine.  It's fine.  No, I know.  It's okay.  No, it's great.  I've got a can and a string now.  I just pull it taut, and I can talk to anybody.  Come on, guys.  You know, she's like, I don't know.  How are you?  So how have you guys been, okay?  Yes, Marianne.  We're okay.  How many people you got for the contest tomorrow?  We got a lot, Marianne.  It's the eggnog drinking contest on the show tomorrow.  We're encouraging the listeners to show up before the show outside here.  Where are we?  Shut up.  111 57th Street here in New York City. 
[01:15:00]  Maybe I'll come up if I get a chance.  Just come up without her.  Maybe I will, because I'm on vacation right now.  All right.  All right.  Just come by, all right?  All right.  Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.  If not, I have a nice birthday.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Just come by tomorrow.  Well, I'd like it to bring old Fatty along with her.  See where she's bruised this week.  Absolutely.  What part of her jaw, you mean?  Oh, her jaw was so swollen and black and blue from that punch.  You only get that from a punch.  Of course.  In my opinion.  That was such a sock to the kisser. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  You just know that made that guy feel so good, too.  It made me feel good just hearing about it.  Shut up.  Have a knuckle sandwich, you.  Oh, really?  We're getting requests for that?  Actually, that's not a bad idea.  What's that?  Well, I was talking about the dumps and stuff, and someone is requesting green poopies from  Demented World.  Oh, the guy from the Chinese restaurant.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  We can do that.  I think this guy was laughing a little bit, Opie.  Huh?  I think this guy was enjoying this phone call a little bit. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  And then we'll go back to the phones.  We're not really taking a break.  We'll just play this from Demented World and continue.  Hello?  Hi, this is Harry.  I was in your restaurant the other day.  I got some takeout.  Yes.  And ever since, I've been pooping green.  What?  I've been pooping green.  You've been pooping green?  Green poopies?  Yes.  Lots and lots of green poopies.  And I went to a doctor, and he told me to go back 48 hours to see what I ate.  And the only thing I could think of is the takeout from your restaurant. 
[01:16:30]  Uh, when is that?  I got takeout Sunday afternoon.  Oh.  Sunday afternoon.  And ever since, I've been pooping green.  What did you order, sir?  Uh, beef and broccoli.  Beef and broccoli.  And I've been pooping green ever since.  Have you ever dry heat from your butt before?  No.  Oh, my God.  After all the green poop he left, I was still getting the squirts, but nothing was coming out.  Oh.  I think after all these, uh, all these couple days, you are the only one complaining of, 
[01:17:00]  uh, let me know about this thing.  Well, the doctor suggested I come down with some of the green poopy, and maybe you could  identify it.  Mm-hmm.  We could throw it in a strainer, and maybe if you could identify the broccoli, things  will be okay.  It's okay.  If you can come down with it.  Have you ever pooped green?  No.  It's not fun, let me tell you.  Yeah, I know something like that should be, uh, uh, pretty, pretty bad, too, you know?  Well, I got green racing stripes in my underwear.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:17:30]  It's not fun.  Are you laughing at me, sir?  No, I'm not.  I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just, uh, you know.  Oh, I'm turning into a Play-Doh fun factory.  Jesus Christ.  Lots and lots of green poopies.  Jesus Christ.  What, what, what, what is your feet?  Oh!  Wait a minute, I'm gonna be, try even for my butt again.  Listen to this.  Oh.  See, nothing comes out.  Yeah, but when, when you go back to the, to the doctor again, see what the doctor can, 
[01:18:00]  can identify with, uh, what, what is it?  Because we, we, we, we, we're not in the medical staff.  We cannot identify anything about those things.  You've never heard of green poopies before?  No, never.  This is the first case I can hear about it.  Yeah.  Would you like to hear another dry heat from the butt?  Oh, I think it should be good enough.  Oh, well, let me do one more.  I'm in the bathroom with a cellulophone.  Oh, did you hear that? 
[01:18:30]  Yes, I hear you.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wow.  This is exhilarating.  A little, uh, call on our Demand World CD.  I was entertained by that. 
[01:19:00]  Sure, laughing a little.  Let's say hi to Richard in Denver.  Hey, Richard, what's up?  Hey, Dick.  Hey, not much, guys.  How you doing, sweet lips?  Hi, Richard in Denver.  Thanks for calling the program.  Well, actually, I'm just kind of wondering, is Jimmy on Grand Theft Auto 7, Draft?  Jimmy's not, but your pals Opie and Anthony are.  Oh, no, I heard your radio was on.  I still haven't heard myself on the GTA.  I haven't either. 
[01:19:30]  I wonder if Laszlo's bullshitting us.  It's a good little bit there.  But I swear to God, the voice of Eddie Pulaski, one of the crooked officers,  it's Jimmy.  What does he say?  Everything he says sounds exactly like Jimmy.  I'm not kidding you.  I swear to God, it's Jimmy's voice.  Isn't it Chris Penn that does that voice?  It might be, yeah.  I think it is.  Well, we'll have to get that audio so we can compare.  I think I have the same manager as Chris Penn. 
[01:20:00]  I love him.  Really?  Yeah, I think my manager does have, yes.  All right, Richard, thank you.  He is just blown up into a dirigible.  The guy just does not care how fat he gets.  Jay Moore does the best Chris Penn impression.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jay did Chris Penn.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  I hear Jay listens to us every morning on the replays, right?  And he's going to call us eventually.  I hope so.  He never wakes up now.  Well, the only reason he hasn't called us yet is because he's in California,  and this show is, well, right now it's like 4, 15 in the morning.  Yeah.  He's asleep.  He's trying to set his alarm and wake up so he can call us and say, 
[01:20:30]  hey, it's been a long time.  We haven't talked to Jay.  He does Harvey Keitel and Chris Penn.  I mean, anyone who does those, I mean, the walk-in we all know,  but those two are fantastic.  No one does them.  Chris Penn, he gets the spitting going and everything.  By the way, GTA was awarded best game of the year, right?  Was that when it got best game of the year?  Grand Theft Auto.  San Andreas.  San Andreas on the Spike video game award show. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, there are too many goddamn award shows.  People were saying that a few years back, but now, I mean, there really are.  Every night there's another award show on.  You go through the channels, you'll find an award show.  And I was watching the Spike TV video game awards hosted by Snoop, Snoop Dogg, Opie,  who, in my opinion, just has no more street cred.  The guy used to be a goddamn gangster.  A gangster, and I'm talking one with an A at the end. 
[01:21:30]  Not even an R.  He was a gangster.  And now he's just, he shills for anything.  Anything.  The for shizzle stuff is, you know, please.  How many more years are you going to do that one?  That was funny for five minutes.  Oh, let's get crack-a-lackin' with Rice Krispies.  Snap, crack-a-lackin' pop.  He just, he's got this whole Snoop attitude like, I'm still a pimp. 
[01:22:00]  Still pimping.  But, you know, he's pretty much a Saturday morning cartoon now.  That's what he's become.  So he's doing the video game awards, and he comes out, and he's hosting.  He's saying, let's get the show crack-a-lackin'.  And it starts, and he goes, they want to give me a co-host.  I said, no way.  Until they told me who it was going to be.  Me. 
[01:22:30]  And then he turns to this big video screen, and there's a computerized computer game Snoop Dogg.  And now he's doing dialogue between him and the computer Snoop Dogg.  We've got to get that audio.  Now we've got to hear this.  It was awful.  I'm sitting watching going, what happened to this guy?  He's not cool anymore.  I'm sorry.  Well, it happens to everybody.  Yeah?  Yeah, Hollywood just gets into your blood.  Once you get a Polish or a big roly-poly black maid, it's all over. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.  Next thing you know, I'm going to be driving a stretch black Escalade limo.  Yeah, that's what.  Park my car, please.  I have to go inside and collect some of my money.  And then we're going to get a mansion in the Hamptons.  That's exactly what's going to happen.  That's what happens.  You get a Polish maid, and then next thing you know, that's what happens.  Sure.  I'm selling the mansion.  I don't like my neighbors.  Don't make enough money.  Now I make half a billion dollars.  I got to move out of the neighborhood.  I think I saw a darkie. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, it was Robin.  So, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas won video game of the year.  Also, Anthony, Halo 2 won best first-person game and best design.  That's bullshit.  I mean, Halo 2 is a good game and all, but it's a console game.  I mean, I think it wins because somebody in the audience, what's his name, that is in the game,  who was the guy that used to be on that show Beauty and the Beast?  I don't know.  He was the Beast. 
[01:24:00]  He's in a lot of movies now.  God damn, I can't remember his fucking name.  Jimmy, anything?  What's reading?  What are you reading?  Just the Amber Frey thing.  I was just seeing if there's anything on the Amber Frey.  Or Frey.  Frey.  Whatever.  Frey.  Whore.  God, I just...  I'm going to correct names.  The names just slipped my mind at this hour.  Which name?  It's the guy...  Remember that show?  Does Steve know?  Steve, you know.  Ron Perlman.  Ron God damn Perlman.  I wouldn't have known that.  Big-headed Ron Perlman. 
[01:24:30]  What show?  Hmm?  What show was it?  Remember that old show Beauty and the Beast?  Oh, no, no.  He was the Beast with the Beast makeup on.  That was Ron Perlman.  But he's in, like, Halo 2.  He plays that character in it.  And he was there.  So I think that's why they gave him the award.  Because, like, a real guy could show up to accept it.  It's a console game.  You're not going to get as good graphics on a television set.  It just doesn't happen.  But they're not talking about graphics.  Just best first person.  But that's just one thing.  I think Far Cry was better than that. 
[01:25:00]  Half-Life 2, I think, was better than that.  Even Doom 3 was better than Halo.  Halo just had the most press around it.  I think that's why it won.  I disagreed.  Crackalackin'.  Crackalackin'.  I was crackalackin'.  And then best sports game, Madden NFL 2005.  That one's just going to be huge forever.  Every year they put it out.  And so ridiculous.  All those EA sports games, they put out a new one every year.  And it's the same goddamn game.  Well, they adjust it slightly. 
[01:25:30]  One little thing.  Hey, you can make the fans in the stand paint their faces.  All right, great.  What is that going to do for gameplay?  It's like the Tiger Woods golf game, you know?  It's a great game.  They put a new one out for 2005, and there's no difference.  I think you could change a couple of things with the golf courses.  Big deal.  Except maybe now there's a white chick on the side walking around with a baby of indiscriminate color.  Ruining the main character's gameplay.  And they'll take a mongrel race.  Both races will be destroyed. 
[01:26:00]  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  Well, there you have it.  This guy wants to say something real fast before we take a break.  Triple H will be on the show, hopefully in minutes.  And we got a really, really hot brunette that's here that's going to be completely nude.  She's lovely.  We know that Triple H likes to spank girls, so we're hoping that...  But last time, remember what he did to the girl's ass?  Yeah, but I don't know if he's going to spank anymore.  Dr. Wigwoff.  He goes out with Stephanie McMahon, I don't know. 
[01:26:30]  Is he still dating her?  He might be pussy whipped now.  Maybe he doesn't spank girls anymore.  I didn't say that.  What?  Jesus, Ben.  Yeah, Ben, why are you saying things like that?  Look how hot this girl is.  She's going to be on the show next.  I know, that's very hot.  And we'll get our pictures up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com so we can share with you guys.  But, wow, she's quite a looker.  She's very, very pretty face.  Quite a dish.  Quite a dish.  Joe, the trucker, what's up?  Very beautiful girl.  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Great show. 
[01:27:00]  You make me laugh every day.  Thank you.  But, listen, when the girls are giving guys head on the road, we call the other truckers on the CB and we tell them that the girl's bobbing for apples.  Nice.  Well, that's a good one.  Paints a picture.  Punching out.  Bye.  Thank you.  Who the f*** was that? 
[01:27:30]  Who the f*** was that?  I'll beat up a chick for you.  What?  What?  What?  Eh, eh.  Oh.  Eh, eh.  Ow.  You're not gonna do it.  You're not gonna do it.  You're not gonna do it.  Okay, watch this. 
[01:28:00]  Baby, baby.  Get out of here, twat.  Baby, baby.  Stupid friggin' twat.  This is a turn-on.  Go for the throat.  Let me just show you how serious I am.  Dad, you like to suck my ass.  Get in the coffin.  Howdy, faggot.  You son of a bitch.  I don't know why I just did it right.  Yeah.  The very worst of the opiate Anthony F.U. life. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, this is Eddie from Brooklyn, and I want to say a big fuck you asshole.  To my fuckin' boss who haven't gotten off my dick all goddamn week with one extremely  minor mistake.  Fuck you, you stupid bastard.  This is a big fuck you to Steven Soderbergh for making Ocean 12, a steaming pile of cinematic  dog shit.  Thanks for ruining a great fuckin' first movie with a pizza shit sequel with awful dialogue 
[01:29:00]  and wrecking great fuckin' characters.  That movie sucked.  I walked out.  Thanks for caving in.  Steven Soderbergh, fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a fuck you.  Whoever's doin' the variety out of these days.  The same six fuckin' bands all the time, and they all peaked in like 73.  For some variety in that fuckin' shit.  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to Jeff, who I just heard on the replay, who says,  I can't stand some goddamn truckers, well listen, you baby raper, you and your ugly fuckin' wife,  who's probably been chasin' too many parked buses, you guys can go fuck yourselves, because 
[01:29:30]  everything you have from stuffin' in your fat fuckin' face to wiping that fuckin' moon-sized ass of your old ladies is brought by a fuckin' truck driver, you fuckin' turdwad.  So Jeff and his wife, fuck you.  This is a big F.U. to Rich Voss.  Fuck you, fuckin' cokehead.  Yeah, I probably know who'll punch you in the fuckin' face, cause you're a fuckin' shitbag cokehead. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, Rich Voss.  Fuck you, shit dick.  This is for that guy that said he hates truck drivers.  Well, fuck you.  Everything that you own has been on a truck.  If it wasn't for trucks, you wouldn't have anything.  So fuck you.  Think about where you get everything and where it comes from.  And what it travels on.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big F.U. out to Pat.  Fuck you, Pat.  You fuckin' douche.  You fuckin' can't show up to work, make me stay an extra hour and a half. 
[01:30:30]  I don't give a shit about the money.  Fuck you.  Gotta fuck you for Master Poe and Voss.  I'm an X-Armor Avenger and I'll whoop both their asses at the same fucking time.  Adios, muchachos.  See, my little daga puta.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1.  1-866-FU-LINE1. 
[01:31:00]  Well, fuck you very much.  First of all, white people, when I say Mexican, let's get it right off the bat.  I mean Mexican from here.  Okay, you understand that?  A Mexican from here.  There's a fucking difference.  There's two kinds of Mexicans, white people.  Two fuckers, two.  White people, you think there's only one kind of Mexican?  Au contraire.  No.  There's fucking two.  There's us.  English-speaking, articulate, and a very intricate part of the fabric of American society. 
[01:31:30]  That is who you see here tonight, okay?  You seem to confuse us for that fucker in front of Home Depot.  Hold the fuck up, papa.  That's not me, fucker.  No, no, no.  That fucker who cuts your grass?  Cuts our grass, too!  And he does a better job at our house because we tell him in Spanish. 
[01:32:00]  All right, and sometimes he's family.  Like, some people are like, we don't, uh, what do you mean, Carlos?  We don't get it.  There's two kinds of Mexicans.  Oh, yeah, like, there's two kinds of white people.  Don't act ignorant, fuckers.  Yeah, there's you white people, then there's redneck trailer trash.  You know exactly what the fuck I'm talking about.  Oh, now you know, don't you? 
[01:32:30]  You've seen them all.  I've been to Kmart.  You know that skinny-ass trailer trash that has no ass?  It looks like just a leg coming out of some Daisy Duke shorts.  You know, you think she's wearing shoes and you get close.  Oh, my God, that's her foot.  Jesus Christ!  How do you get a callus that thick on your foot?  Oh, my God, that's her foot.  Oh, my God, that's her foot.  Oh, my God, that's her foot.  Oh, my God, that's her foot.  Oh, my God, that's her foot.

I didn't know they got married.  They got married last year?  Yeah, around last year.  And now Triple H, they say he's paralyzing WWE.  Like, he has the whole political thing going on now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gets whatever he wants. 
[01:35:00]  That's why he was champion for a year.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Jim.  One more thing.  Well, we should get Triple H in here.  Worst attempt I've ever heard.  Jim, one more thing.  Uh, he's our old friend, Triple H.  Yes.  It's been a while.  And it was very funny.  Time to play the game.  Time to play the game.  Jesus Christ, you're even bigger now.  What the fuck? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Triple H has entered the studio.  What's up, guys?  And what I was trying to say before the music kicked in, it was really funny because Master  Poe was telling you where to sit.  Right.  And I'm like, no one tells Triple H where to sit.  You know what's funny about this whole place is you walk in here, right?  It's this beautiful building.  Old school, beautiful building.  You walk in here.  You get up.  The hallway's real nice.  You walk in the door.  It's like walking into a Hell's Angels, uh, you know, militant group up front.  But you walk in.  The guy's like, hey, how you doing?  Hey, you want some hot chocolate? 
[01:36:00]  We got a great hot chocolate machine.  The mini marshmallows.  Cookies, anything like that?  Can I get you something?  That's what you get.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I think Master Poe was finally starstruck.  Really?  Yeah, I do believe he was starstruck by Triple H, definitely.  He's our security guy, and he's, I don't know, quadruple black belt.  But you guys need security.  Like, was the FCC going to come up here?  Well, not the FCC.  We really don't know why.  I know you guys don't have that anymore, but they might want to come up here and just  fight you guys now or something. 
[01:36:30]  We signed with XM Satellite Radio.  I'm sure you know what happened to us.  Yeah, yeah.  Sex and St. Pat's and all that.  And they're not really telling us why there's a lot of security around here.  We don't know.  We don't know what kind of...  Apparently they got a few threats.  They might have gotten some threats in Washington or something, because we have bulletproof  glass.  We have this Master Poe guy that's in this...  He's pretty much a killer.  A train assassin.  Panic rooms.  You push the button.  This opens up.  You guys hide in the baggage.  Yeah, we run in and hide in our armored room like a couple of faggots.  So we don't know why, but there's a lot of security, yes. 
[01:37:00]  It'd be good radio.  You guys squealing with gunshots going off.  Yeah, screaming like women.  Hey, I gotta tell you what, though.  I mean, I was so excited to hear that you guys were back doing this, man.  Because I missed you guys.  You guys were awesome.  Sitting out two years sucked.  Yeah, I'm sure it did.  It was really rough, man.  It's great for you guys to be back doing what you do, because you guys are awesome at  it.  Before we start, though, I go to commercial, and I run to go take a leak, and I see Triple  H.  I'm like, hey, what's up?  And I give him a handshake real fast.  Dude, you gave me the wettest handshake. 
[01:37:30]  Is that urine or water?  Yeah, I'd just been in the bathroom.  You guys don't have any paper towels in there, or toilet paper, or anything.  No, I had the water in my hand.  It's like, it's cool to shake Triple H's hand, but what was on it?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It was just clammy.  I was nervous, guys.  No, it wasn't even clammy.  You don't get nervous.  Do that all the time at parties or something?  If you walk around with a drink in your right hand?  Yeah.  And then you go, oh, yeah, meet this guy.  You give him the cold, icy, wet hand.  Well, now I'm embarrassed that I did that, because that's one of my pet peeves.  We do these book signings and all this stuff, and you meet all these people, and you understand 
[01:38:00]  people are excited and they're nervous, but they come up, hey, doing it, and they just  The wet rag.  Yeah, dude.  I don't know where that hand's been, but it's really nasty.  Speaking of the book.  It's got this bevy of bacteria on it, you know?  Yeah.  Well, I got the, we don't shake hands anymore, because I got the flu really bad.  We go for the fist.  Oh, that's great.  We go for the fist.  It's the fist now.  So you've given me the flu now.  Well, no.  No, you don't have it now, do you?  No, no, no, no, no.  He had gotten it a while back.  I had it for like a month and a half, because we were doing a promotional tour, and our fans 
[01:38:30]  were coming up to us with the clammy hands.  Right.  So it's a guy all red with fever, and he's sweating, and shaking your hand, and coughing  into it, and then shaking it.  You're watching him, three people back in the line, digging at his balls, and scratching  and stuff, and then they're like, hey, how you doing?  Nice to meet you.  I've seen guys just wipe their nose just before they give you their hand.  I'm like, dude, come on, help us out a little bit.  Sneeze in our cough.  Yeah, put the hand out.  God damn.  And in the bathroom is the best, too.  And you're sitting there, you're standing there taking a leak, and the guy was just pissing 
[01:39:00]  next to you, and reaches over, hey, dude, love the show, or nice to meet you.  Yeah.  You just had his dick in his hand.  Yeah.  A second ago.  It's a hand job by proxy.  The guy's...  Even if he didn't have his dick in his hand, does he really want your hand that just had  your dick in your hand?  Apparently he does.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I've never understood that.  Still got cock warmth on his hand, slapping it into your palm.  Hey, sorry about the pube there, buddy.  Yeah, take that with you.  Yeah, you can keep it. 
[01:39:30]  Go ahead, sell it on eBay or something.  We notice in your book there's a lot of pictures.  Yeah.  Less reading, more pictures.  Yeah, you know, that's...  I try to help people out.  Yeah, make it an easy...  You know, what's funny is I did a book signing the other day, and I was at this Borders bookstore,  and the lady...  You know, it's like very librarian-type, snobby bookstore lady, and she goes,  I think it's great that you've written this book.  I'm sure a lot of your fans probably have never picked up a book, and this might help  to expand literature, and I'm looking at it like, that is like the most pompous thing 
[01:40:00]  I've ever heard anybody say.  Like, I'm sure they've never picked up a book, you know?  It's a nice stereotypical view of...  Yeah.  I hope you put these near the comic book so people can see them.  You know?  Could you be more condescending?  The pictures are really good.  If you're sitting on the crapper, it's great to just...  Yeah, there's some flip through there, you know.  Well, you know...  Why don't you start out with a pop-up book, you idiot, is pretty much what she's saying.  It's, you know, it's supposed to be a motivational book for training, and...  Well, I mean, it talks about my career, but it's training stuff, and you kind of got to 
[01:40:30]  show the exercises and all that, so it's got a lot of photos in it, and...  Is there any chance of anybody attaining that type of physique?  Dude, I mean...  I mean, it's...  You know, we have to think that at some point it's a lot of DNA.  It's a lot having to do with DNA.  You know what, though?  I mean, when I started, I was 14 years old.  I just did another show earlier today, the WB Morning Show, and when I was there, there  were these 14-year-old kids there, and I was thinking, God, that was me.  Really?  Were you skinny, or...?  Yeah, I was like 6'1 at 14.  I weighed about 145 pounds. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  You know, when I walked in the gym, I'm sure that everybody in the gym looked at me and  went, get out of here, you know?  Yeah.  Are you going to do Mop the Floor with you?  You know, but I hung out.  I just wasn't going to go away, you know what I mean?  I hung out, and those guys ended up...  I was kind of like the gym mascot, I think, you know?  They just took me under their wing and pointed me in the right direction.  That's kind of why I wrote the book, really.  I think I just want to...  You know, if there's some kid out there that's thinking about going to the gym and wants to  get in shape, but he doesn't know how to do it and doesn't have anybody telling him,  maybe he picks that up and gets him going in the right direction, you know?  Getting sand kicked in his face at the beach? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That old gag?  Yeah.  You know?  He could bulk up and kick some ass.  Yeah, although nowadays, at 14, too, he's probably hot because he can't get laid or something,  you know?  So he just wants to get some action and thinks, like, God, I better get in the gym,  you know?  Jim, you were going to read his book, right?  Yeah, I could certainly use it.  Just something to take away the extra 30 pounds in my stomach.  Jim, you might want to read it twice.  I just got slammed by Big John Studd. 
[01:42:00]  That really hurt.  Big John Studd.  Good callback.  That is a good callback.  So you got married.  We didn't even know.  Yeah, one year ago.  Man, we've been out of it for a while.  We're so self-centered.  When our lives are on hold, everything is on hold.  You guys just, like, holed up in your houses and didn't come out for two years.  That was pretty much it.  Just two years of doing nothing.  We're like, he's going out with Stephanie, and people are like, no, you ass.  You married her a year ago.  Yeah.  I agree.  We got married October 25th last year.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  She is going well.  It's going great, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  It's going real good.  And you get the perks because it's the boss's daughter.  You know what?  Everybody thinks I get the perks.  I actually get it worse.  Really?  You know, it's just like Vince certainly in business doesn't want to look like he's playing favorites.  Yeah.  So, you know, now an idea that I would have given him that he would have gone, that sounds great.  Now he goes, well, sounds all right.  But you know what?  I don't want people to think I'm doing it just because it was what I'm doing.  You pitched it in front of everybody, so let's do something else.  Listen up, sonny boy.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Plus, now it's like a family thing.  And trust me, he takes stuff out on the people he's closest to, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to be rough.  I've got no complaints.  He's a great guy.  How are the holidays?  You sit there with the McMahons?  How weird is that?  You know, at first...  I just picture the table getting turned over and the turkey being thrown at each other.  Yeah, because, I mean, you've been involved with Vince for a really long time, but now  you're sitting at his table during Thanksgiving or Christmas or what have you.  It's really cool.  I get along with him great now.  I mean, really, now I consider them my family as much as my own family, you know. 
[01:43:30]  And I think Steph feels that way of mine.  But at first, I would love to have video of the first time I went over to their house  for dinner with Steph, you know.  It was like this 6'4", 270-pound guy that looks like the...  Leave it to beaver sitting at the table like, yes, sir, Mr. McMahon.  Not saying a word.  And I think Vince was as nervous as I was.  You know, it was just like a really awkward situation.  That is odd, man.  We just kept laughing at each other, you know.  Yeah, it was just really weird.  Because in the ring, there have been times where you're right in his face and pushing 
[01:44:00]  him and throwing him down.  It was probably his worst nightmare to begin with until he got to know you that his daughter  was going to bring home a wrestler, you know, if you think about it.  It's funny.  A lot of people have said that to him, but he's...  And I think a lot of people within our business, I've had other wrestlers say, like, God, I've  never let my daughter wrestle.  Well, what if she brought home George the Animal Steel?  Yeah, I mean, that would probably have been a little bit different.  Especially because of the age.  Yeah.  He's got a colostomy back then.  I don't know either. 
[01:44:30]  But, you know, at first, I think everybody thought that.  But Vince is so, like, he loves the business so much and he thinks that everything is so  cool about it.  I think as long as it was the right guy, he wouldn't have cared what the guy did, you know, as  long as it was the right guy.  And luckily, he and I, before I even ever met Steph, he and I had a really good working  relationship and a lot of respect for each other in that sense.  We got along really good.  So, you know, it didn't really make a big difference as far as that.  Because it was just awkward for a little bit of time there, you know.  Like I said, that first dinner, if you'd had a camera on it, I think you could probably 
[01:45:00]  sell that for some good money because it was really awkward.  No matter how much you know each other in business, it's a brand new situation.  It's got to be a little awkward.  Yeah.  But now it's...  Now, I mean, it's...  What are you going to get him for Christmas?  You know, he's like the ultimate guy that has everything but uses nothing.  He is the simplest guy.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I mean, he just doesn't use anything.  He's not technologically advanced.  Like, I mean, unless his electric shaver breaks, there's absolutely nothing to get him. 
[01:45:30]  You know?  So it's...  I mean, I don't know.  It's like, you know, I get him wrist straps for the gym or something like that.  Yeah.  That's the only thing he does is...  He's still a workout animal, that guy.  ...wrestling and goes to the gym.  Yeah.  I mean, he's going to be 60 years old this year.  I got to tell you, we can't fake it.  I haven't watched wrestling in a while.  I mean, and you know, Anthony and I were into it for...  I know.  ...like hardcore.  I don't know what happened.  When we fell off the air, like I said, yeah, we just kind of fell at it.  Well, I know you guys couldn't pay a cable bill. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know...  Well, they were still paying us, thank God, but...  Yeah.  ...I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  So what is going on in wrestling?  Like, give us like a quick update.  Well, you know, a lot of people talk about our business now.  It's a little bit down right now.  It's always gone through phases throughout its history, too.  Yeah, and it's not really down a lot, a little bit, but I mean, we lost a lot of guys  for a lot of different reasons.  You know, Stone Cold got hurt.  He can't wrestle anymore.  Rock went to go to Hollywood.  Mick Foley was injured.  And decided to write books.  I mean, we lost a lot of guys all in one brief period of time. 
[01:46:30]  Brock Lesnar, trying to do the NFL thing.  Yeah, with the dumbest move in the world.  Yeah, we were talking about that.  He won a Bonehead of the Year award.  Yeah, I mean, you know what?  I guess on one hand, I guess I can't blame him.  If he hated traveling that much and he didn't enjoy it, then I guess he should get out.  You know, and that was the biggest thing.  I think he just hated being on the road.  You know, and he wanted to...  I don't know why he thought playing football, I guess, because it was...  He was just going to play for his hometown team, I guess, is what he thought or something. 
[01:47:00]  I'm not going to any away games, guys.  Yeah, I'm just going to play the home games.  That's it.  But, yeah, so he decided to leave.  And this is the craziest thing.  But, you know, as of right now, I think he's made calls to come back, but I don't think  they're too interested in him right now.  You know, it's just...  It's a hard thing to...  All these guys sacrifice and do a lot of things to put you in a position you're in and the  company does, and then to just walk away from it without giving anything back.  That's bullshit.  It's a little loyalty issue there.  And then when you try to come back because other things failed, you're going to have a 
[01:47:30]  little bit of a problem.  Vince seems like the kind of guy that loyalty is pretty high up on his list.  It is, and you know what, I mean, eventually Vince will, I mean, he's had guys screw him  over way worse than that, and eventually it comes around, and eventually he probably will.  It's because he's a good businessman.  He understands if it works out and money-wise it's a good deal, he's going to...  It's just the unfortunate thing for Brock is he hadn't been around long enough to make  himself a big enough name that right now if he came back it would make a big deal.  It really wouldn't.  Right.  You know, so there's not that much incentive for Vince to go, you know what, I know you screwed 
[01:48:00]  me over, but come on back here.  So we'll see what happens.  So what's your story these days?  With me, I just got stripped of the world title.  Damn.  Yeah.  You know what?  And I've been champ nine times now.  Nine times?  Nine times.  So we're going to have an Elimination Chamber match, which is me against Chris Benoit, Jericho,  Batista, Randy Orton, and Edge, and that's in Puerto Rico, January 9th. 
[01:48:30]  Nice.  What's the chamber match entail?  It's this gigantic metal structure that is absolutely brutal.  We had one, I think, either a year and a half or two years ago.  I wrestled in it, and Rob Van Dam actually landed on my throat.  I spent almost like 36 hours in the hospital because my trachea started to close down.  They wouldn't let me leave.  They said I was going to, if I went to sleep, I might die, you know, and the whole thing. 
[01:49:00]  I mean, it was brutal.  It's a really non-forgiving metal structure and stuff like that.  So it's pretty violent.  Yeah.  So I'm looking forward to that.  Was that worse than the other injury you had?  The whole thigh muscle?  No, no.  Have you heard about this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, I forgot about that one.  You want to explain again for the new listeners out there?  This is the sickest thing I've ever heard happen to somebody.  The leg thing was the worst.  I was, well, it was actually not the sickest thing.  Sid Vicious jumped off the top rope one time, and his leg broke in half the bone. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, I remember seeing that one.  This was actually probably worse from a physical standpoint, but I was in the ring wrestling  a tag match with Austin against Benoit and Jericho, live TV on Raw.  I went to hit Jericho from behind, and when I did, I planted my leg, and my left quad completely  ripped off the bone.  Just rolled up my leg.  Yeah.  And we had about five minutes left of the match, and I continued to wrestle with my  quad ripped off.  When did it stop hurting?  When I had the surgery.  No, when they gave me the good drugs.  Yeah, it was brutal. 
[01:50:00]  I remember seeing that one.  I flew, it was in San Jose.  I mean, if you watch it back, it's like I wrestle the match.  The second it's over, I just roll up in the fetal position on the floor and just wait  for somebody to come and get me out of there.  It was brutal.  And I went straight to Birmingham, Alabama.  This guy, Jim Andrews, Dr. Jim Andrews, who's done everybody in the sports, from Michael  Jordan to Roger Clemens on down, did my surgery, and it was a career-ending injury.  They basically told me nobody comes back from these, but I did. 
[01:50:30]  I stayed in Birmingham for the next nine months.  I never went home.  I rehabbed from nine in the morning until six at night, seven days a week, and came back.  Damn it.  No problems with it.  Right after I came back.  I came back in January, and that year, going into WrestleMania, my knee started to bother  me.  I went and got an x-ray done.  We just happened to be going through Birmingham.  Went and got an x-ray done, and I fractured my kneecap.  When they put your quad back on, they drill holes in your kneecap, and they just run sutures 
[01:51:00]  through it, right?  That's all that holds your muscle on.  And my kneecap had cracked.  And then I couldn't take time off because we were going into WrestleMania, so I just kept  taping it up and wrestled like that.  After WrestleMania, it was really bothering me.  I went and got it checked again, and the corner of my kneecap just broke off.  I had floated over into the side and is lodged in a bunch of tendon.  And he just said, well, it'll hurt for a while until it heals up, but just we don't want to  go in and cut it out because it's in the scar tissue that is now my tendon. 
[01:51:30]  So he said, we'll just leave it there unless it starts cutting through something.  We'll just keep an eye on it.  And I've been wrestling with it that way since.  Now it's fine.  Yeah.  I just got this big lump on the side of my knee.  It's like formed a pearl in there to try to round it off a little bit.  Eventually, I'll have it taken out and carve an ashtray out of it or something.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  A kneecap ashtray.  Yeah.  God damn.  You guys, over the years, you've gotten so much more intense with the moves and everything.  I think that has a lot to do with the injuries that you see. 
[01:52:00]  And why, maybe a few years back, a lot of the guys got out of the business all in one  clip like that.  Yeah.  Because, like I said, I haven't seen it in a while, but you guys were starting to do  some stuff that was just, I'd watch and go, now they've completely lost their mind.  This is stuff that will kill you.  Yeah.  We've tried to tone it back some and get back to the actual storytelling and wrestling  stuff.  And we've been pretty successful at that, so it's helped some.  But I think that's, you know, the injury rate is so high in our business because of  that.  We kept pushing the envelope, pushing the envelope and all that stuff. 
[01:52:30]  And, you know, eventually something's got to break.  Unfortunately, it's your body.  You know what I mean?  But, I mean, when I was down there in Birmingham, I mean, Andrews does, like I said, everybody  does a lot of football players and stuff.  And he would always put wrestlers over.  I mean, he's done a lot of guys in our business, too.  And he would always put us over as just saying, like, I don't know how you guys do what you  do.  Because he said, you guys come in here 10 times more beat up than anybody from any other sport,  but you're never complaining about it.  He said, you know, football players get one-tenth of that injury and, you know, they want to 
[01:53:00]  take a year off or whatever.  And, you know, our guys don't do that.  You know, it's just the way we're ingrained in the business, you know.  Back out on the road, traveling more than any other sport.  How much longer do you think you're going to do it?  Well, with the movie out now.  We're going to seg into that, because now you're becoming a big movie star.  Well, I wouldn't say big yet.  You're getting there, bro.  You know, I don't want to leave wrestling.  And that's what I keep telling everybody is I still want to top my resume to say wrestler.  And I still want to do this as long as I can.  You only get a... 
[01:53:30]  Wrestling's what I love.  And you only get a brief window to do what you love doing, you know.  But the movie thing is picking up, and that's definitely an interest to me.  But I think that there's a way to do that and be able to do both.  You know, go for two, three months, make a film, come back to wrestling for six, ten months,  whatever it takes, and then make the next one that comes along.  But it's a great position to be in, because I've got a gig that I love,  so I can be really selective about what I do.  I don't have to just take the next script that comes along.  I can be really selective about what I do.  And The Rock doesn't wrestle anymore at all, right? 
[01:54:00]  He really just comes in, you know, a show here or there.  If we're in his hometown or something, he wants to get some TV coverage.  Does his thing.  He just comes out and, yeah, you know, runs his mouth or something like that,  smacks somebody around and leaves, you know.  He'll probably be around soon.  WrestleMania is coming up.  He'll probably want to do that gig, you know, so he'll start coming around soon or something like that.  It's funny that as soon as WrestleMania comes, all the guys come out of the woodworks.  Oh, hey, how you been?  That's the big show.  Mike, on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:54:30]  Talking to Triple H.  Yes, I know, Triple H.  Big, huge fan.  Been a fan of you for a long time.  Just a mire of your work.  Thanks, man.  Sorry to see that you lost the title.  Just wanted to tell you a little bit about the movie.  I saw the movie.  I thought you were awesome in it, man.  Great activity.  Thank you.  Maybe you can tell the fans a little bit about it.  What was that?  Maybe you can tell the fans a little bit about it.  Tell us what it's about.  Yeah, I haven't seen the movie yet.  Yeah, it's, well, it's the third in the Blade series.  Love the Blade movies. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, they're great.  I was a big fan of them, too, which was, I was thrilled when they came with me, to me  with this script, you know, it was just because I liked the first two so much, but this one's  a bit different.  Wesley Snipes is in it, still hunting the vampires, but there's another group that's with them  called the Night Stalkers, which is Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds, and Parker Posey's  also in it.  And I play a vampire, and, you know, we're trying to end the human race, and Blade and  the Night Stalkers are trying to save it, and that's the gist of it.  I saw a clip, I think it was Ryan Reynolds, that you picked up and just slammed into the 
[01:55:30]  ground.  And I was like, that could not possibly be him.  That was the only, I'll tell you what, he's a tough guy.  Yeah.  And he's a comedian and all that stuff, but he gained 20 pounds for that role, and the  only thing he didn't do was that one slam.  Yeah, because I looked and went, there's no way another human being that isn't trained  for this.  Yeah, I did it to the stunt guy twice, and he was pretty fucked up.  I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's the only thing Ryan didn't do the rest of the time. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, I was throwing him, that room was just a concrete room.  I must have thrown him across that room 20 times.  And I would see him at lunch in his trailer with ice packs all over him.  Laying against the thing, and he'd hobble out after lunch, he'd hobble back to the  set, you know, and I'd be like, are you all right?  You gained that much weight for the role?  Because I saw him on one of the movie posters, and I didn't even recognize him.  Yeah, he trained for like six months.  He was, I mean.  Really?  He was ripped.  He looked awesome for the film, you know, and so did Jessica, too.  They both trained for like six months for the film, and they were both pretty jacked 
[01:56:30]  up.  You get to do any sword play?  No, you know, I didn't.  There was supposed to be a scene with Wesley Snipes and myself where I had a big axe.  And he had a sword that we were supposed to fight with, but they ended up, there's a  lot of issues with Wesley on the set.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they ended up changing the script a lot, and I ended up doing a lot more stuff with  Ryan because of it.  Was he a little diva about having an axe swung at him?  No, the official statement is that Wesley was Blade the entire time that we were shooting. 
[01:57:00]  Gotcha.  He was really...  So licensed to be an asshole.  Yeah.  That's what Triple H wants to say.  No, I'll say, I've come right out and said, he was really cool to the 6'4", 270-pound  wrestler that was looking at him.  Really cool.  Gotcha.  Everybody else, he wasn't so cool, too.  You know, a lot of people had problems with him.  The director had problems with him.  A lot of people, you know, that he didn't get along with on set.  He was fine to me.  He was great with me. 
[01:57:30]  I had no problems with him at all.  Yeah, he's not going to screw with you, that's for sure.  Who the hell's going to screw with Triple H?  Yeah, I think he just didn't know, you know, he just wasn't too sure of the situation,  so better be safe than sorry, you know.  So everybody has to kind of refer to him as Blade on the set?  He's like one of those method things?  Some guys do that.  Yeah, no, you know what it was?  Most of the time that I saw him, everybody was so hot at him, nobody referred to him  at all.  Really?  Yeah, he really didn't talk to people much.  I mean, there was one, I mean, there was a lot of situations, but other things where  people just wanted to talk to him and he just said, save your breath. 
[01:58:00]  I mean, you know.  What an ass.  Yeah, it was kind of stiff, you know, but like I said, he was cool with me.  He and I got along fine, but a lot of other people that, I think you'll hear a lot about  it.  I think they just, you know, a lot of people didn't want to say too much about it until  the movie came out, but I think now people will talk a little more freely about it.  Is that like your first real big movie?  That's my first movie.  Yeah, I've done a lot of TV stuff, but that's my first movie role, yeah.  That's cool.  Other offers coming in?  Yeah, right now, especially with the movie coming out, it did real well this week. 
[01:58:30]  It was the number two, but it was the number one action film for the week, and it did real  well, so there, you know, a lot of things are coming in now, a lot of scripts, a lot  of people calling.  A few wrestlers can make that transition.  You know, The Rock, obviously, has found his audience and niche.  I think Roddy Piper was great in Them.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  They Live.  Oh, They Live.  Yeah, that was good.  Right, right, right.  Very good.  Yeah, with the glasses.  That was great.  I'm kind of looking for my Suburban Commando or Mr. Nanny vehicle. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  That's funny.  That is really funny.  I'm looking for the next hot thing that goes direct to video where no one buys it and says,  okay, he's rotten.  I'm just going to hang the scripts on the wall and throw a dart at him, dude.  Yeah.  I'm looking for the next thing that's available.  So you're being careful.  Anybody can do a good one.  You know what I mean?  Right.  It's like the chicks.  Anybody can do a hot broad.  There you go.  Yeah.  It's the real lemon.  Yeah.  It's a bad, real piece of shit that's hard to wrap yourself around. 
[01:59:30]  When you can stink the nation up and theaters worldwide, hey, now you've accomplished something,  my friend.  Hey, what is up with Hulk Hogan these days?  What's the latest on him?  You know, he's not wrestling anymore.  What I heard, he's just kind of being the, what would they call that, the pageant mom  and running his daughter around the country.  His daughter's hot, though.  Yeah.  She's really hot.  It's unbelievable, right?  She's like 14 or something.  I know.  That's the scary part about it.  You see the pictures.  It's a little weird.  You see the pictures.  You think she's like 18, 19, maybe 20. 
[02:00:00]  She's like she's 35 and been divorced twice.  Yeah.  Then it says under the picture, no, she's 14 years old, but she's like six foot or something  already.  I'd have her chained to the house with a shotgun next to her with her string tied on.  If somebody moved her and shot their head off, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, I think he's just kind of promoting her and she's got an album out or something.  And I know like I'll see every now and then that she's like singing the national anthem  at some sports game or something like that.  So I think he's just kind of doing the promotion biz. 
[02:00:30]  Let's say hi to Shane.  Shane, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing this morning?  Good, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, Triple H.  Yeah.  Question for you.  You're going to add the new X-Pac and China porn in your DVD collection?  I might do that.  The quid is the size of a little Connor arm.  I'll tell you how brave we are, Triple H.  I know what he wanted to talk about.  I didn't want to mention it to you live.  Yeah, no, I mean.  We were talking about the China video yesterday, by the way.  Have you seen it?  No.  No, we saw stills from it.  We got the stills.  And I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  I mean, we've had China on the show a bunch of times.  She's a really, really cool person.  And I just feel kind of sorry for her, in a way.  You know what?  We're talking about China made a porn tape with her.  They don't go out anymore, right?  X-Pac?  What day is it?  Because I don't know.  Oh, really?  It depends.  One of those relationships.  You used to be friends with X-Pac, right?  I still am.  Oh, okay.  They both have some demons in their lives, you know what I mean?  And they've been off and on, but he's still a friend of mine.  He called me six months ago or so, and I tried to help him out, try to get him some help 
[02:01:30]  and get him going in the right direction.  And whether that works out or not, I don't know.  And whether they're back together or not, I don't know.  I talk to him now and then, and it's one of those off and on things, and I don't really  know much about it.  But unfortunately, it's one of those things where, you know, it's somebody that could  have had the world and just let it all fall away and now is really, you know, I hate to  throw stones because I don't know everything about their lives, but really just scraping  the bottom of the barrel. 
[02:02:00]  And it's sad.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we were saying.  Sad as a person.  I don't, you know, I mean, just, I don't, I don't have anything to do with it anymore,  but it's just sad to see anybody.  I don't know, even if I didn't know them at all.  I was going to say, knowing where she was and then you're looking at this, we were looking  at this yesterday.  It's like, wow, man.  Yeah.  What is going on in her head?  He was actually, he was actually really pissed about it at first when, when the rumor first  came out that she was going to do this.  It was one right in the middle.  So no one stole the tape.  They, they, they did this on their own.  You think?  I believe, as far as I know, she sold it to the people that did the Paris Hilton video. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, exactly.  One night in China.  Yeah.  And he was actually really pissed about it at first.  And then in true guy fashion, he said, he said, well, I know the tape she's talking  about.  Well, at least my hose looks big.  That's all guys share about it.  Yeah.  That's what he cared about.  As long as, if it's going out nationwide, as long as it was a good angle, I'm okay with  it.  As long as I wasn't filmed after getting out of the ocean, I, it's fine.  Yeah, it was a warm day.  I had a good fluff going on.  You know.  What was the situation with China leaving WWE? 
[02:03:00]  Because I think there was actually some people talking to blame put on like you.  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's the thing is she and I were apart.  And, and then I started seeing Steph and that was an issue.  But prior to.  Which was a huge upgrade, by the way.  Yeah.  We love Steph.  Yeah.  She's the best.  She actually is.  I love her to death.  But, you know, she just, it's one of those things that sometimes the more success people 
[02:03:30]  get and it just starts to become all about them.  And, you know, she got more and more miserable and more and more bitter.  I used to say that to her all the time.  When I met you, you were selling beepers and you were the happiest person I knew.  Now you've got everything you ever wanted and you're miserable 24-7, you know.  And it just, she was at a time she was negotiating with Vince and she just wanted  so much stuff.  I mean, I, I know the things that she wanted and see, she had the benefit of knowing what  I had in my deal. 
[02:04:00]  You know, there was only a couple of guys that had certain deals in the company and  that's, she wanted that deal, but only better.  And you must have been on fire.  You were on fire at the time.  Yeah.  I mean, I was, you know, it was me rocking Austin.  You know, I mean, that was the deal.  And, you know, they just said to her, that's absolutely ridiculous.  You know, and she, she blew her own deal with Vince and she can spin it any way she  wants and try to blame it on anything she wants.  She blew her own deal with Vince.  They were, they were more than willing to give her a hell of a contract, let her just 
[02:04:30]  work TVs and push her in Hollywood.  More than willing to do that.  Um, and, uh, she just, the whole, she just let the whole thing go away.  And I think really, I think what she thought is, I don't need you.  You know what I mean?  I actually, I don't, I don't need you.  She thought at the time, you know, that she had had some talks with some people, I believe  about Terminator three at the time and about Wonder Woman and all this stuff.  And she blew all of that.  And I mean, it just, it's just a, a, a downward spiral.  And now, you know, obviously if you're putting out a porno video, a home porno video of 
[02:05:00]  yourself, not to knock anybody that does that, but if, if, if you've been to those  heights and then that's, now you're putting out a home porn movie to make some cash on  the side.  That's exactly why we were sad.  You have a little reflection.  And what's going on with her clit?  Jesus.  Dude, I don't know.  No, I'm dead serious.  Jim thinks it's the hottest thing ever.  Hottest thing ever.  I like that.  It's a little too big.  It looks like, uh, I don't know.  It looks lovely.  It's like a thumb. 
[02:05:30]  It's like a, there's something going on there.  It makes me a little nervous, but you know, Jim loves it.  He thinks it's the best when they're nice and puffy and big like that.  We all have our thing.  That's my thing.  Hey, you gotta have your thing.  You know what I mean?  You could be into some weirder stuff than that.  I'm amazed.  I'm amazed how many people leave wrestling, think they're going to be just absolutely huge  without Vince.  And then it just never happens.  It's unbelievable.  Over and over again.  It's unbelievable.  And you know what?  The weird thing is, and I don't mean to say this in like a knocking fashion, but it's the,  it happens to the women more than it happens to the guy. 
[02:06:00]  I've seen it happen to more women.  What's her name?  I forgot her name.  Sable.  Thank you.  Yeah.  She thought.  Sunny.  Sunny.  Sable.  China.  I mean.  They think they're bigger than the wrestling.  Yeah.  They get to a certain point.  And it's like the, uh, the fall off the cliff point is Playboy.  Right.  All right.  It's like they get the offer or they do Playboy.  And then the, like the next day they're like, and you're going to do what for me?  Yeah.  Mr. McMahon.  Screw you.  You know how many offers I've had last night over the phone.  You know, and it's like the second they don't even get it. 
[02:06:30]  Cause the second they get off the TV, the phone stops ringing.  Right.  You know, oh wait, Vince is not behind you with the promotional vehicle anymore.  You're not getting seen by 20 million people a week anymore.  I'm sorry.  Who are you again?  Yeah.  That's why the people are calling you in the first place is because of your, the forum you  have in front of that many people on the wrestling.  And also it's pretty much your identity.  Sure.  You can't use China.  No.  Anymore.  And no one cares who Joanie is.  Exactly.  And, and you got to realize that's, that's where your fame is coming from. 
[02:07:00]  She fought Joey Buttafuoco.  Oh, that's right.  That was brutal.  Would they take her back in wrestling now or no?  No.  At this point, I'd, I'd highly doubt it.  I'd highly doubt it.  You know, I mean, up to the point of maybe where, up to this porno point.  Yeah, right.  I think there's a line you cross there where it's just like, yeah, how can you go back  to that?  You know, I mean, so I, I would highly doubt it.  I mean, it's kind of the end of the road, I think there for, in a lot of ways.  How many, how many of the guys own their name? 
[02:07:30]  Do you own Triple H or?  You don't?  No.  Um, there's a few guys that own, own, uh, bits and pieces of it.  Like, you know, Steve Austin, I think owns Steve Austin, but he doesn't own Stone Cold.  Stone Cold.  You know, um, but, but the thing is, even if he did, it's, it's not about just the name.  It's about the promotion that comes with.  And, and not only that, but the fans, they come with it.  And that's what I don't understand what people get.  It's like when people ask me if I'm going to leave wrestling to go to Hollywood.  You know what?  Even if I got hurt tomorrow and couldn't wrestle anymore, but I could still make movies, I 
[02:08:00]  would still stay in wrestling in some way.  You can't walk away from what brought you to the dance.  Not, not to mention the fact that I love it, which is why I would stay for no other reason,  not fans or anything like that.  I love it.  So I would stay.  But on the other side of that, you can't walk away from all that.  The, the, the people that brought you there, the, the fans that got you there, the guy  that got you there.  Yeah.  You know, it's, it to me is like, you know, when I do the red carpet stuff, it's like,  I want to put Vince over as much as I can because it just, if, if the way I see it, 
[02:08:30]  if I can go make a movie and there's, you know, a lot of people that watch the movie  go, this guy's pretty good.  He's a wrestler.  When's that on Mondays?  And they tune in to watch that.  It helps the wrestling business.  It just, it's, they wash each other's backs.  You know what I mean?  And it just works out for everybody.  I've never understood the other way.  The Rock seems to have really done well as far as doing that, keeping a good relationship  with the wrestling and then going out and doing his movies and stuff.  But he's not saying, you know, blowing off wrestling totally.  Right.  And it's, it's kind of, it's a good business move too. 
[02:09:00]  You know, he's able to promote his stuff in front of a huge audience.  Sure.  And I think that's important for him to do.  You know, I think there are some fans that, you know, think Rock did like, you know,  cause he's never around.  And I think there are some fans that are disappointed that he's left, but they're very excited when  he comes back and he does come back enough where, you know, fans are still feel like,  like you said, he's not just turned his back on them and walked away and said, you know,  to hell with you.  You know, he's, he's kind of kept a foot in the door and that's, that's cool.  You know, it's, it's kind of, I've always felt it's kind of like what Arnold did with 
[02:09:30]  bodybuilding.  You know, he walked away from it.  He didn't compete anymore, but he's always had a foot in either a gym or he's got his  own show or, you know, he talks about bodybuilding when he goes on.  Or he's smoking pot with Tommy Chong.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  We had Tommy Chong on.  He's like, Oh, I used to get high with Arnold all the time.  Likes his weed.  Yeah.  He likes his weed.  All right.  He's smoking pot and pumping iron.  Let's go to the phones.  Phil in New York.  What's up, Phil?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  We're talking to Triple H.  Triple H, man.  Good job in blood. 
[02:10:00]  You got some acting chops.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  Listen, I got a little question for you.  What, what transpired between you and Goldberg?  Because, uh, didn't you guys have a problem for a while?  And then he came and you guys seemed to work together pretty good.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, it was really, I think just a misunderstanding.  I think Bill, you know, he's a good guy, but he's kind of a hothead, I think.  And, uh, you know, he, he read some stuff on an internet and I, I don't know whether  it was stuff I actually said very, very well could have been or not have been.  I've never hidden the fact.  And I've said it to Bill that, you know, he's not a great wrestler. 
[02:10:30]  He's, he's had a hell of an image and all that stuff, but he wasn't necessarily a great  wrestler technically, you know?  And, uh, he read some stuff, pissed him off.  But the, the, the stupid thing that he did was, and this is because he's a hothead is  we were at a toy fair together in, in, uh, I think New York city, I was at an autograph  booth signing and actually, I actually was with Steph and I'm at a booth and, uh, I hear  somebody yelling and I knew he was there, you know, but I didn't think anything of it.  You know, he was at WCW booth and I heard somebody yelling.  And when I looked up, it was Goldberg, like 20 feet from me with nobody between us, just 
[02:11:00]  yelling, you know, swearing at me and saying, I'll kick your fucking ass and all this  stuff and I'm at first, I thought he was kidding.  Like, I thought it was one of those things where he was going to say a bunch of stuff  because there were fans there and then kind of give me the smirk and walk off, you know?  Then I realized like city and serious and I started laughing, which made him madder.  Sure.  And, uh, but you know, the thing was, it was nobody between, he made himself a good ass.  There was nobody between us.  Um, it was, you know, and I laughed at him and he got more, you know, more agitated and 
[02:11:30]  threw a big fit and then took off through the crowd.  He didn't spear you?  No, no, he didn't.  He didn't spear me.  And, uh, yeah.  You're going to yell and scream.  There's no one between you and him.  Yeah.  You know, you got to make your move.  So when he first came in, everyone's brave when there's people.  Hold me back.  Hold me back, man.  First day that he came to the WWE, I was, you know, I didn't know what to expect.  And, uh, I saw him, I was in, uh, catering and, uh, I saw him walk in. 
[02:12:00]  So I got up and walked across the room.  I wanted to just hit the confrontation right in the head, you know, if it was going to happen.  And I walked across the room and as soon as I got to him, he grabbed me and hugged me  and said, we're going to make a lot of money together, man.  And, uh, that was kind of the end of it.  You know, he just, later he just said, you know, dude, I was just hothead.  I made a mistake.  And sorry.  I said, well, you know what?  If you ever have a problem, just pull the guy aside, man.  Just pull him aside.  Say, hey, you got a problem with me.  Yeah.  Let's hash it out.  You know, I mean, that's how you do it.  You don't.  Have you ever purposely hurt anyone in the ring? 
[02:12:30]  No.  Come on.  No.  Just gave him a little extra because you were pissed at him backstage.  I've beat a guy up in the ring before.  I beat a fan up in the ring before, too.  Some fans up in the ring before, too, for hitting the ring.  But, um, I beat a guy up.  I hear that goes on.  I mean, you know, you don't get along with everybody.  And there's wrestlers that, you know, when they get in the ring with some of these guys,  they'll give a little extra.  Put a little extra.  You know what?  It's a situation, though, where in the ring, in what we do, I have to trust the guy I'm  working with with my body because I'm putting myself in positions where he can cripple me.  He has to trust me with his. 
[02:13:00]  That's crazy, by the way.  If I had a problem with somebody, I'd handle it outside of the ring and not in the ring.  There was just an incident not that long ago where one of our guys got mad at another guy  and punched him in the face, blacked his eye, and beat him up pretty good in the ring.  And, you know, that guy came real close to getting fired.  Vince was so mad.  It's just something we don't tolerate in our business.  Now, I've had a guy before, when I was in WCW one time, I just started there, and there  was a young guy there that tried to, I think he thought, like, if I make myself look  real good at his expense, maybe they'll give me a job. 
[02:13:30]  And, you know, we got in the ring, we were having a match, and all of a sudden he just  tried to take me down and jump on me.  And then I just pulled him over, beat the crap out of him, and pinned him, you know,  and got out of the ring.  And when we got to the back, I just, you know, pulled him aside.  What the fuck was that?  I don't know.  If you want to go, let's go right here, not there.  You know, and we hashed it out.  All right, let's go to a little extra something.  Let's go to Rev in Jersey.  Rev, what's up?  Oh, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Triple H, best wrestler of all time.  I've just got to say, I'm completely floored to be on the phone with you, man. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you.  I've got a ton of questions I want to ask you, but I'll just go with the first one.  What are your thoughts on wrestling websites and how they spoil the storylines, particularly  they spoiled the tough enough winner?  Punch it out, Maverick.  There he goes.  Punch it out.  Yeah, that's got to be tough now that the internet is so popular where, you know, people  go to these taped events and then give all the results on the fan sites, and everyone  likes to go to the fan sites, so it's getting, you know, everything's getting ruined for them.  It's hard.  You know, I have a lot more respect for the ones that say, like, spoiler and don't go 
[02:14:30]  here if you don't want to know, you know.  The internet is a tough thing, you know, and I think it's in everything we do.  I think that I guarantee the internet is part of the reasons, you know, the NBA's beating  up fans, you know, because the fans know so much about you, and what they don't know,  they make up, and they have their own opinions on, and there's so much of that out there,  and they can really...  Are you talking about whackbag.com?  We've got the fan sites and the message boards that, yeah, they think they know everything 
[02:15:00]  about us.  Yeah, it's the same in every business, you know, and everybody knows everything about us,  and everybody has their opinions and stuff, and it's all a joke.  It's these people that don't even have...  It's a 12-year-old kid in Podunk, or, you know, some guy that wished he was a wrestler  and he's mad because he wasn't, or, you know, thinks he has a friend that knows this guy  that's cousin's brother's uncle was in the office one day, and, yeah, I mean, it's just  ridiculous, and it's a shame, and unfortunately, what we do in our business, there's a lot of,  you know, it's a lot of impact and surprise stuff, like things that you're not expecting, 
[02:15:30]  and when we do things, it's like now at arenas, we're having to, like, be careful, like,  if we have something that we're going to do that we want to be a surprise, it's like  you can't, nobody can know.  We can't tell the other wrestlers, we can't tell the crew, you know, if it's like, you  know, if we want to surprise and bring Rock out on the show, it's almost like we don't  want to bring him to the building until he goes on live, because as soon as somebody  sees him, they're on the phone with their friend who calls up the internet guy, and then  it's on the internet, Rock's going to be at Raw tonight or whatever, you know, 
[02:16:00]  I mean, it just, it just kills everything, and then, as a fan at home, it just kills  the surprise, and it just ruins, it's like knowing the finish of the film, like, three  quarters of the way through it, and the guy next, he goes, I saw this yesterday, watch  this, the guy gets killed at the end, you know, it's just, it's brutal.  Bruce Willis was dead the whole movie.  Yeah, I know, that was great, I read, I read that we have our instant feedback over here,  and people can just email into us, and we read it on the fly as it goes by, and one day,  years ago, I'm just sitting there, we're talking about movies, and talking about Sixth Sense, 
[02:16:30]  and I look over, and all I see printed is, Bruce Willis was dead the whole movie.  I go, hey, thank you, you son of a bitch, you just wrecked that for me in like one sentence.  So then we had to say it on the air.  Yeah.  Of course, because it was ruined for me, we had to ruin it for all of us.  Yeah, misery loves company.  Yeah.  You ever read anything on Message Board that, like, stuck in your head or pissed you off or  something?  No, you know what, at first, especially when I first got with Steph, you know, because 
[02:17:00]  it was like one of those things where, you know, I was on top in the business, and I was  chairman, I was all these things, and nobody had a problem with it.  The second anybody found out that I was involved with Steph, it was all like, I didn't deserve  any of it, it was all, you know, because I'm banging the boss's daughter, now I got this.  Now, did you sit there and read some of these and just go, you sons of bitches?  Because every now, you know what, I would never go on, I don't even know how to turn  a computer on, but every now and then somebody would show me something or give me something, 
[02:17:30]  you know, like, oh, read this, you know, and yeah, it would piss me off.  What lunatic's going to hand you something like that from a Message Board?  One of the other guys trying to piss me off, yeah.  Like, oh, you might want to read this.  Yeah.  And leave it on your locker or something.  And that, you know, got to me at first, now I could care less.  I mean, there's just so much of that out there that I could really care less about it.  And there's just reports on everything in, because I have a behind-the-scenes relationship  with somebody that's also important in the business, it's like the most talked about 
[02:18:00]  thing, and there's always somebody with an opinion, or I did this, or I, you know, threatened  this guy that he was going to get fired if he didn't do that, like, I have that ability,  or, you know, I mean, it's just, you know, Pat Patterson, one of our agents, just left  the business, and, you know, he's like, Pat's like 60-something years old, 65 years old.  He's retired four times since I've been with the company.  He just, he misses the business, he ends up coming back.  He retired again, you know, and decided he wanted to be out of the business.  Well, it was like the big internet thing was it was all because of me. 
[02:18:30]  Like, Pat and I didn't get along anymore, and I went to Vince and said,  you fire Pat Patterson, and Vince fired him.  You know, I mean, it's just ridiculous, you know.  Stupid stuff.  Yeah, it's just silly.  Actually, now it makes me laugh, you know, it's just funny.  Yeah, some of the stuff they think up on their own and write down like it's fact.  Yeah, it's just, I wish we could come up with that good a storyline.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Hey, are you allowed to spank girls anymore?  We used to bring girls in for you to spank.  Yeah, you know, that was a big factor with my wife. 
[02:19:00]  Right before I left.  Today?  Yeah, you know, I was.  You've got to remember, man, we were huge with the WWF, well, now WWE, and, yeah, they  all used to listen all the time, and Triple H would come in here, and we would find the  finest pieces of asses for you to spank.  Yeah.  What we, it's funny is, one of the guys that was coming in here with me the day, one of  the last times I was on was this guy, Mark Carano, that was a publicity guy for our company,  came with me on the appearance at the, I don't know if you guys remember, I had him spanking  the girls, and told the one girl to make out with him and all that stuff. 
[02:19:30]  To this day, his nickname is Spanky in the office.  Yeah, and I just saw him yesterday, I was like, dude, I'm doing Opie and Anthony tomorrow,  and he was like, get out, I'm not going, oh, that's bullshit, you know, he wanted to  be here so bad, you know.  So you got to talk from Stephanie?  She knows us a little too well, too.  I got to listen, you can do anything, please just don't touch.  Yeah.  That was the talk I got, so, you know, I mean.  Do you want to at least see the girl you've got?  Yeah, you know, I heard you had a girl here, and I saw somebody kind of wander by in the  hallway, and yeah, you know, I'm all for that, and there's no cameras in here, right? 
[02:20:00]  No, no, none of those aren't even running.  No, those, see, we even covered them up.  Yeah.  Well, we just covered them up, too.  Yeah.  That's what, security?  That's your, in case the bullets start flying, they know where you guys are running to.  Exactly, they know who to make the arrests.  Go get the girl, let me, uh.  Now, what was this, I saw you guys, which, by the way, I just did the final McEnroe show  yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys put one nail in his cuff, and I finished him off.  Yeah.  Yeah, you had the finishing move. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, but I saw you guys on there, and you guys were talking about some bat thing or something  like that, right?  Oh, there's the, yeah, it's the famous football bat.  Yeah, they edited our interview big time.  Oh, I'm sure they did.  We got really into describing what goes on with that bat, and yeah, it never made air.  It's the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge, where the girls tried to, I think we retired it,  yeah.  They tried to get that black mark closest to the middle of the bat, and whoever does  at the end of the year wins a prize.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive, though.  You know what's even more impressive?  It's from the handle end. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, this is where the lung blew out, right there.  Triple H.  We were on John McEnroe the night that the Red Sox won the World Series for the first  time in 86 years.  Really?  No one saw our appearance, except for you.  Trust me.  Usually when we're on TV, you get a lot of email, and your family call and saw you on  TV.  Not even family members call.  Were you guys aware of the McEnroe show's ratings?  Oh, yeah.  I don't care if every other station was blacked out, nobody would have seen that.  Yeah, it was in the last place to begin with, and then the Red Sox decided to win a World 
[02:21:30]  Series for the first time.  John's a nice enough guy, too.  He was great.  We had a lot of fun with him.  Yeah.  He just didn't...  No, I had a blast on there yesterday.  He just, you know, unfortunately didn't work out for him, but yeah, he was doing like  a 0.00 rating, and I think that's pretty much the end of the road for you.  That's done.  In the TV business.  There's no really going to the boss and saying, I think I could build on those numbers.  Yeah, no.  Nothing there.  Well, here's the girl.  Hello.  We don't even know your name.  That's why I'm saying, here's the girl. 
[02:22:00]  Serena.  Serena.  Look how beautiful Serena is.  She's a very beautiful girl.  Yes.  I was looking at pictures of you on the website.  We're going to get pictures up on opieandenthony.com of you.  There's a naked one right in front of you there, Triple H.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  I took that last night.  How tall are you?  I'm about 5'2".  5'2"?  You took that last night?  Last night.  I was working Uncle Inky all night last night.  Wow.  Citystylegirls.com?  Citystylegirls.com, yes.  Yeah.  What kind of site is in it?  What?  It's a site with hot girls on it.  Hot, nude girls.  What do you think? 
[02:22:30]  It's an H&R Block tax site, you idiot.  No, I mean, is it hardcore sex or is it just pictures?  I know it's naked.  A lot of pictures of nude girls.  Yeah, some are hardcore.  Just ask a question you want to know.  Anybody with a big button on there?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy seems to like.  Jimmy likes the big buttons.  Yeah.  A clit that looks like a shrunken head.  All beautiful girls on that site.  Beautiful.  And you have a website, stunningserena.com?  Stunningserena.com.  And what do you do on your website?  Anything good?  My site is kind of like Playboy. 
[02:23:00]  There's no dildos or anything like that.  So it's pretty, I wouldn't say reserved, but I get naked.  You were kind of covering up your lap with your hand.  Yep.  Yeah.  Covering up.  How are you going to make money on the internet doing that?  These days it's all about the hardcore stuff.  Really?  You do?  There's guys out there that like it.  How old a gal are you?  Huh?  How old a gal are you?  I am 20.  Do you have proof of this?  20.  Yes.  All right.  You gave them all the proof.  All right.  She can't even drink it.  Let's say we had a Jägermeister machine in here.  I can't even drink.  Yeah.  She wouldn't even be able to take a shot off of it. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Let's say you didn't have a hot cocoa machine in the other room and you had a...  There was a Jägermeister machine.  Yeah.  Can we see your hiney?  Oh, yeah.  You want like the underwear hiney?  Yeah.  That's always good.  I'm wearing cute underwear.  Wow.  Those are really nice.  Yeah.  Those are beautiful.  Those are those little lacy short type things.  Your wife isn't going to kick my ass.  No.  I was told as long as I don't touch it.  Yeah.  No touching.  I'm good to go.  I understand.  Triple H isn't touching.  Yeah.  You could just... 
[02:24:00]  You should just lose the pants.  All right.  Yeah.  Get rid of the jeans.  The whole panties thing is great when you just see it, but it's got to have the  whole leg thing.  All right.  Oh, my God.  You know.  The guy that's covering up the window is like going so slow at the bottom so he can  continue to peek through the crack and the side.  Exactly.  That's our New York Times that we're supposed to read before the show.  It covers up the window.  And I've just realized some of the most lucrative real estate is these windows right across from  your office that you can...  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  There's a couple that has sex in that building over there.  We catch them every once in a while.  Yeah?  Having cigarettes after they have sex.  It's like 20 guys with binoculars in that upstairs one right now trying to catch them.  Working on that floor.  Yeah.  We have to cover up the windows.  We don't get it because it's just nothing but guys here.  I don't care.  I really don't care.  No, it's not about you.  Trust me.  It's about being sued by I don't know who.  That would be one of the things that I wouldn't get if she did care.  And she says she doesn't, which is awesome.  But if she did care, I've never understood the I can put my crotch in the internet, but I  don't want anybody to see it in person.  Not live. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Not live.  You can look at pictures of it all day and do whatever you would like to it.  But that three-dimensional thing just freaks me out.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Should we take the top off now?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Those are nice panties, too, by the way.  They are really nice.  Oh, and it's a matching set.  It's a matching set.  Should I lose the bra?  Yeah, you might as well.  Yeah.  Why not?  It's awfully warm in here.  If you really want to.  It's awful warm in here.  Because I'm just going to come after you.  She's not going to come after you.  Oh, no.  Not looking.  It's a no-touching one.  You got the speech.  It's a no-touching one.  Wow.  Hey. 
[02:25:30]  Bravo.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're 20, all right?  You're 20, all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, those are...  You don't even have to cut her in half and count the rings.  Those are 20.  I want implants, though.  No, stop with the implants.  Why are the girls obsessed with implants?  Because I want them vegan out there.  No, those are perfect small boobs.  Thank you.  They're like full Bs, right?  You just halfway convince you.  You're like, those are perfect small boobs.  Small boobs.  Nice backhanded.  Yeah.  Those are perfect big boobs.  No, not every guy's into the big boobs.  I'm into more of the shape.  Those are very nice.  Yeah.  Triple H, right? 
[02:26:00]  No, they're very good.  She's got nice nipples and everything like that.  They're very nice.  They point in the right direction and everything.  They're good.  They stand up on their own.  If they were drooping down, then I'd be a little...  Yeah.  If Triple H was allowed to, would you allow him to spank you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's such a drag.  Why did you get married?  Yeah.  Why did you get married?  You know...  Could you spank her, Jim?  Not like he could.  It's going to be like a little...  Who wants to spank me?  I don't care.  Yeah.  Someone's got to spank her.  I'll bring my manager, Barry, in here.  He might do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's Barry? 
[02:26:30]  Someone's got to spank this girl.  Yeah.  Because this is what we do when Triple H comes here.  I know.  A girl has to be spanked.  I'm not sure if he's still here.  That whole interview thing was like, whatever.  It was to get to this point.  It's like the finishing move has to be the spank.  Of course.  All right.  Who's coming?  Here he is.  Here's Barry.  All right.  I would love to, but you know, I've got Mike.  You got kids, you mean?  You can't because you have kids?  Yeah.  I just got to look at him in the face.  He's giving you the wife pregnant at home story.  Right.  Oh, man. 
[02:27:00]  What a buzz killer.  No?  Jimmy, why don't you just give her a little whack on the ass?  All right.  Yeah.  Jimmy, go ahead.  Barry, you might as well stay and watch.  You won't be hot about that, though.  Ben.  Yeah.  Hey, Serena, is there anything else you would do for the show today?  Whatever.  Don't say whatever.  Do you know who you're talking to here?  Opens up a lot of area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Literally.  Kind of bend her over a little.  Should we lose the panties even though they're really sexy?  Yeah, I would say so.  I'm just afraid of being in my hand.  Wait, but you do it slowly.  I have to face this way because I'm riding.  If I go that way, I'll be even worse. 
[02:27:30]  Let's say this way.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  You sure are a lovely gal.  Thank you.  Completely shaved.  Could you do a little spin?  Yeah.  Could you do a little spin?  Not a stitcher head.  That's what I want to say.  Hey, wow.  Nothing.  We're taking pictures of this for the website.  Who's this guy?  That's Uncle Pinky.  That's Uncle who?  Uncle Inky.  Who's Uncle Inky?  That's my man.  The nasty porn guy.  I'm the crusty porn guy. 
[02:28:00]  I wasn't sure if he came with you.  I don't know.  If he came with me, what the hell is he going to do with me?  He's one of your handlers.  I don't know.  I thought it was Captain Lou for a minute.  He's selling pictures of my balls out on the street.  What's he going to do?  Sir, could you sing Truckin' while I spank her?  I was thinking Jerry Garcia, yes.  A little Jerry Garcia, too, sure.  All right, so what are we doing here?  Wow.  Am I supposed to be like, ooh, baby?  No, not at all.  Wait, get over there, Eric.  Hold on a second.  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to set up the camera perfectly. 
[02:28:30]  Because we're going to face this way so we can get by the mic.  First of all, I'm a guest here.  She should be at a better angle for me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let Hunter see.  Yeah, there you go.  Let him get a better view.  There it is.  All right.  Get the mic in there.  And Serena is bent all the way over with her tiny little 5'2 body.  Did you shave in the lobby?  Jesus, did you shave in the lobby?  That is like as smooth as smooth could ever be.  I shaved this morning.  This morning?  Yes, I was.  How smooth is that?  It's really smooth.  No, how smooth is it?  It's smooth.  Could Jimmy touch it to see how smooth it is?  Can you just see how smooth it is?  Oh, yeah, sure. 
[02:29:00]  No?  You don't want him touching it?  Go ahead.  Just touch it and see how smooth it is.  We want to see how smooth it is.  It's smooth.  He just went out of sight.  Yeah, really smooth.  He just busted one, I think.  Yeah, I think he did.  He had like a little shiver there for a second.  Clear stuff in my socks.  Wow.  Yeah, you are a treat there.  Yes, Serena.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Oh, damn.  That's a good one.  You get that mic closer, man. 
[02:29:30]  And get the mic on her.  Oh, we got the one mic on her.  And this video will be up on foundyourmusic.com and opiananthony.com tonight.  Okay, run forward, miss.  All righty.  Here we go.  Thank you.  Oh, Jesus, Jim.  Damn, I'm going to have a bruised laugh.  That's all right, right?  Did you like that?  Yeah, you've got to get pictures of him.  No, Triple H.  Triple H spanks even harder than this.  Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm almost happy.  I left Prince last time.  Damn.  Remember, that was a big red handprint.  You're like, no, I'm like...  Is that okay?  I'm too bad, right?  Yeah.  That one stung a little bit.  I know.  Hunter raised up broken blood vessels on her ass in the shape of his huge hand. 
[02:30:00]  And she wouldn't put me over, right?  No.  She said, no, that's nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, give it to me.  I was waiting for you to wind up and punch her in the asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're lucky.  In the asshole.  You can say that on satellite radio.  You're like, Caligula with a fist full of lard.  Where else can you say punch someone in the asshole?  Getting a little red now.  It is.  Turn around, let's see.  Yeah, turn around.  Show triple.  Wow.  Hey.  It is a little bit red.  It's very Christmassy ass she has now.  It really is appley and lovely.  I didn't hate you too hard, right? 
[02:30:30]  I just...  I swear to God, if my publicist comes in here now and tells me I've got to get going,  she's fired.  You want a couple more, Serena?  I won't do it too hard for you.  If it's too hard, I'll do it so hard.  Just a little tap.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  She's a girl, Jimmy.  I know that, but that's one of your goddamn tranny prostitutes.  Look, trannies like to be spanked.  You guys last time told me I spanked too soft, so I was doing a little bit.  Is this in any way exciting for you?  Oh, yeah.  All these guys, if you were doing it, it probably would be, but she's got this mushy oddball smacking  her on the ass.  I'm sorry. 
[02:31:00]  Get the mic back on her.  Is her hiney cheek all warm now, Jimmy?  A little warm and hot?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Jimmy, why don't you rub it?  Rub it a little bit.  I do.  You have to.  All right.  Of course you have to.  It's like Sloth from the Goonies slapping her.  I don't know who that is, but I don't like it.  You saw the movie Goonies?  No.  Me love junk.  That's so good.  I've been for it a little bit.  All right.  Here we go.  Serena completely naked.  Jim Norton spanking her.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh.  He rubs it just to find just the right spot for you. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  He did get a really nice stinging sound to it.  Yeah.  He did a great job.  You have to rub softly.  You're going to have to put some oil on it.  I absolutely will.  Oh, wow.  Hey, does anybody have any oil?  I don't know.  We have some lotion.  Sir, rub the lotion on her ass or else it gets the spank again.  Sir, do you have any oil in your meth lab?  So what does he do, Uncle Inky or whatever his name is?  I run City Stargirl.  He runs City Stargirl. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Really busting apart the stereotypes of the guys that run those sites, dude.  No, he's wonderful.  I've got to tell you.  He's a really rather nice guy.  Yeah, he's great.  His business guide says exploits young women.  What a really nice guy.  I love her.  She's fantastic.  Hey, it works.  You know what I mean?  Whatever.  What's the website again?  CityStyleGirls.com.  Say it slow.  CityStyleGirls.com.  CityStyleGirls.com.  StyleGirls.com.  Well, she's got the tongue ring.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  Yes, I do.  What's the other one? 
[02:32:30]  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  StunningStyleGirls.com.  Just my imagination are our nipples getting hard from the spanking.  A little bit.  I know.  Wow.  Probably.  21.  When did you get into this?  20.  Right at 18?  At 18 I did.  At 18?  At 18.  Right out of high school?  Right out of high school.  What kind of got you in the business?  Actually, my webmaster now, Ant, his online name is Ant.  I met him and he was running NN sites and porn sites and everything and he asked me if 
[02:33:00]  I was interested and I was.  That's one of those things.  His online name is Ant.  Ant.  Oh, okay.  And he loves you, by the way.  He's right in love with you.  Now you've got to spank her.  Maybe you could do a porn site.  He was like, the only guy that can spank you is Triple H.  Well, yeah.  I'm proxying it by Sloth over here.  Oh, yeah.  It's all good.  Who's Sloth?  I don't like this Sloth reference.  It's from the movie The Goonies.  It's years ago.  Yeah, we'll get a still of Sloth.  Can you wiggle your ears?  No. 
[02:33:30]  He could.  What else can we do with you?  Whatever.  What else can we do with you?  It's like a toy.  I love this.  Jesus, it certainly is.  What's her place?  You got any suggestions?  Yeah, let's see something that you wouldn't show us on the internet.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's a good question.  I'm going to show you on the internet.  What wouldn't you show?  You are very lovely.  I'm showing everything.  Feel free to get up on the counter and get in various positions.  No, you don't have to be standing.  I think what Triple H is alluding to is that you either be on your hands and knees just 
[02:34:00]  for a second, maybe facing him, just to show the view from the back and then maybe on your  back just a little bit.  I mean, I'm just kind of paraphrasing.  That's actually a great idea.  That is a great idea.  Yeah.  You're kidding me, right?  Not really.  I think if you, or if you would lay down on your back with your feet facing Triple H and  then maybe do like you would make a snow angel.  It's for Ant.  It is.  Who's a fan of Triple H, remember?  Yeah.  He doesn't do anything.  That's true.  Look, I'm not. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, he was into the ass smacking.  I'm not even going to get to see.  I just want to make our guests happy.  No, actually, the ass smacking was the girl was into.  I just was accommodating her.  My ass is like really on fire now.  It's on Steve.  Hey, Uncle Icky.  I'm sorry.  It is red.  I apologize.  What else could she do?  Oh, it's okay.  It's totally up there.  Well, any suggestions?  I don't know.  I don't know what her limits are.  I'm going for broke.  How retired is the bat?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  What was that?  How retired is the bat? 
[02:35:00]  Not if we do it slow.  It's Triple H.  I know it is.  I know it is.  What if she...  Do we have the drill, though?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I kind of dropped the one at the drill.  No, I wouldn't want to do the drill.  I'm just a beautiful young girl.  Look at this monstrosity.  Joe Triple H.  Oh, my God.  Triple H.  One of our listeners made this.  Look at this thing.  Oh, my God.  It's a cock on a reciprocating saw.  But no, no one's ever used that and can't. 
[02:35:30]  The guys that made it, it's a design flaw where the blade comes through.  Oh, my God.  I don't even remember posing for the piece on the end.  When did they mold that?  I thought that was China's clit, actually.  Oh, me.  Wow.  Had to go there.  I'm sorry.  I thought we were all having fun.  I could get that out there.  Oh, hey, that's...  Without getting punched in the face, though.  Would you maybe like to stand up here?  Face me.  So, Hunter, that's a good view.  You want me to stand?  And then, well, perhaps if you can't stand because it's too short, perhaps you could touch 
[02:36:00]  your toes.  Okay.  Whatever.  I'm trying, Hunter.  Yeah, no, yeah.  Would you have an...  You know, it is satellite radio.  Would you have an orgasm for us?  Would I?  And how long would that take?  It would be like me and rubbing myself in a dildo to...  Yeah.  Or like having sex.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we're asking you.  Would you be willing to have an orgasm on the radio?  You can't just do it with your hand, huh?  It doesn't work with just your hand.  Yeah.  You need a little something in there.  Yeah.  Don't we have...  We have dildos all over the screen.  I'd be so nervous.  I don't know if I could actually get off. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  To be honest, I love that.  Awful.  Yeah.  I'm not...  So innocent.  So innocent.  Would you be willing to attempt it?  Yeah, a couple...  Oh, God.  Just think of the press you're getting.  Yeah.  It's for Triple H.  My members are going to be like, why don't you do this on the site?  These guys will say your website...  They didn't call me.  A million times.  Yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah, they'll think about how many times these guys will say your website.  This story, the spanking story got repeated on the air over and over.  So many people told me about hearing these guys talk about it. 
[02:37:00]  Just think how much they would talk about this day on the radio.  Your website will explode.  God, you're brilliant, man.  Triple H is brilliant.  I have all this pressure now.  I'm just...  You said sex.  Is there a person in there that you're comfortable with?  That you know and that you're comfortable with?  We're not allowed to get the interns late anymore.  The person that I know...  I really was trying to work this out last night.  Oh, no.  I thought there was somebody she was with.  Yeah, we were trying to...  Oh, yeah.  I am.  She is, and I had them this close last night.  I was like, just...  This close.  I'm like, just, you know, I'll put your dick in my mouth and take some pictures. 
[02:37:30]  And he was like, no.  Triple H, are you allowed to spank her with an apparatus because you're not officially touching?  Yeah, I better opt to not touch it.  Yeah, you better not.  I was just thinking to myself, it's like, dick in your mouth.  Is that touching?  Well, Clint says that's not cheating, so...  Yeah.  Who did you say that to?  Who did you make that statement to that you would put their dick in your mouth?  It wasn't you.  To my man.  I know.  I have a man.  He's out there.  And he's here.  He's here.  So why won't you do that? 
[02:38:00]  Because he won't.  Oh, he won't.  Oh, he won't.  No.  He definitely draws the line.  Wow.  With himself, anyway.  I don't want to see his dick, anyway.  No.  We don't have any dildos laying around.  We don't?  How do we not have dildos?  Just if...  I was going to say, I'm like...  All right, listen.  Here's the thing.  Maybe you can't get to an orgasm, but show us the technique that you would use if you  were to try to have one.  Right.  I like the way you think.  Maybe if you can just lay down up here.  Yeah, lay down...  This is all clinical. 
[02:38:30]  Close your eyes and go to another place.  You can blindfold you, so you don't see anybody in the room.  Go to another place?  Come on.  You know, in your head.  There's no better place to be than right here.  Yeah.  Go to this room with all these guys watching.  It's better when I'm by myself in my bed and, you know...  All right, well, go there.  I bet it is better.  Well, how about this?  You call us tomorrow from your bed.  Oh, and I can do...  Screw Triple H.  We would love this on the radio tomorrow.  No, he was saying, screw Triple H.  Go ahead.  Oh, yeah.  You can screw him, too. 
[02:39:00]  I'm trying to help you guys out now, and now he's turned right on me.  That's right.  Of course.  Jeez.  All right, yeah, just come on.  Just hop up there.  Okay.  Do you want me to take these off?  Yeah, you don't need the headphones.  You need cold, hard cash?  Because, you know, we'll...  Yeah, I need your underwear.  Just satellite radio.  They've got money to burn, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Look at this little thing.  There we go.  All right, what are we doing there?  Holy Toledo.  I'll say. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  So what is she doing?  Triple H, this was your gig.  Yeah, she's going to lay back.  She's going to lay back.  All right.  Lay back.  Lay back.  And start to demonstrate technique.  Give her something to lay her head on.  Okay, now my man's watching me, and he's over there, and it's really weirding me out.  Why is he weirding you out?  You're not doing anything with anybody.  Give us the thumbs up, dude.  It's cool, right?  Yeah, he's giving the thumbs up.  He's giving the thumbs up.  He's just looking.  Yeah, he's cool.  Oh, there's some T-shirts behind your head to lay your head back on.  Yeah, a little pillow for you.  There you go.  No, no, no.  No, I like sitting up.  You do? 
[02:40:00]  Hey, okay.  Kind of like arched back, you know.  Oh, very good.  We're all for it.  Some finger action.  Hey, whatever's going to work for you.  All right.  All right.  You don't really want me to like masturbate.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Are you serious?  You seriously didn't just ask that question.  What a great sound bite that is.  Hell yeah.  Look, I'm not even looking.  Yeah, no one's looking.  No one's looking at first.  Then what's the fun in that?  Yeah, watch it.  We will look and look and look.  We're watching.  No, you have to, you're performing to Triple H.  No, no, no.  Everyone else is not looking.  Look.  My head's down. 
[02:40:30]  Okay, this is the way I can get off with.  I'll look at China's pictures.  Look.  With the dill milk?  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Wait, what's going on?  He's trying to tell me something.  You haven't come in here.  It was very smooth of you.  I know.  I'm like, what?  He's trying to signal.  She's like, I want something.  Yeah, the boyfriend is coming into the studio now.  I believe he wants you to throw the fastball.  Oh, I think he's going to come in and show some technique or something.  Yeah.  Wait, grab a mic there.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  This is Ant, by the way.  I figured I'd come in here. 
[02:41:00]  You guys might need a professional.  Calm down.  You know what he looks like?  It looks like Eminem read Hunter's book.  You know, I used to be told to look like Eminem every single day.  You're jacked up, bro.  So I said, man, you know what?  I've got to start getting more into weightlifting.  I'm a huge fan of Triple H.  Thanks, man.  I'm a big man, so I'm like, all right.  Hey, big guy.  Well, here, let me shake your hand before you do anything with me.  How you doing?  So you're going to get involved here?  A little bit.  For Triple H, bro.  For Triple H.  We will talk about her website.  You know, I'm going to put on a show for anybody. 
[02:41:30]  Triple H.  You might as well do it.  Yeah, and these guys will put over her website.  You guys have at it.  Oh, yeah.  CityStyleGirls.com.  And StunningSerena.com.  That's the last plug you get until something happens here.  Okay.  Now, Opie.  I didn't even think we could have to go to an ultimatum, Opie.  Something happened.  I'm just kidding.  It was a joke.  All right.  A bad one.  What do we have in here for toys?  Anything?  Oh, my fucking God.  Oh, jeez.  Hold on.  Damn.  Get a start going there.  Do something.  Do something.  You want to freaking molest me now? 
[02:42:00]  All right.  This could get good.  All right.  Eric, work the mics.  I don't like any cheesy porn music.  We got Serena completely naked in front of us.  We don't have any cheesy porn music.  Yeah, roll the 80s porn music.  Somebody.  All right.  She's arching her back very nicely.  If you need some shirts.  You got to move forward.  He's not Stretch Armstrong.  Yeah.  The hot brunette from StunningSerena.com.  And her boyfriend.  That's what happened and you're plugging in.  Because that was a joke.  Okay.  And now we got the jacked up Eminem guy. 
[02:42:30]  Pretty much.  That's right.  Whoa.  Hey, there you go.  There's something you don't see every day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Triple H, what's going on?  You got the view.  I don't know.  She's got the leg in the way.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You got to move over here.  Here, you can move over here.  Wow.  You got to move this one over here.  Hey, you got to get the good view for Hunter.  Love of God, I just touched your ankle.  I swear to God, that doesn't count.  Yeah.  There was a sock on it.  Yeah.  This direction.  I really hope my parents aren't listening.  What is that that Eric has in his hand?  Oh, KY, you need any of that? 
[02:43:00]  You know what?  Let's go for it.  Hey, whatever.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Holy.  Oh, yeah.  Jeez.  Come back there, babe.  I think she's.  I think he's going to try to fix the fat little lips.  Yeah.  Wow.  He should have been rubbing that on my ass.  After the brutal beating I got.  I think he's about to rub it.

[02:53:30]  And the spoon  I don't know how they missed it  A Chinese farmer getting up working in the field with a shovel all day  Hello, shovel, there it is  You're not plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues  I'm sorry, was that homophobic?  No, I think it was  Because I hear that a lot  Dave, what?  You're talking about being gay  You probably secretly are gay  And I'm like, listen, voice in my head

Korn  Cool  I forgot how much fun Triple H is to have in the studio man  Guy's great  He's a funny guy man  He is  I like him  Well spoken  Yeah it's not like having one of the wrestlers  That are just like a meathead or something  You know  It's funny  Just throwing stuff around and always on like they are in the ring or something  He's personable  He's one of those guys too  That isn't afraid to say what's on his mind and talk about people 
[02:56:00]  It's not like  I don't want to mention any names  Guy just says it  Of course he's not afraid  Look how big he is  As big as that whole doorway  I could never have any concept of what it's like to walk around like that  To just where you just intimidate people wherever you go  It's not easy  Just by the way you look  When he starts talking definitely it's disarming  You know the guy isn't one of those guys that's coming off like he's going to kick your ass or anything  But you know 
[02:56:30]  Do not get on his wrong side  It seems like God knows who to give that size to  Like for instance if I was his size  All I would do is point at Chick's boyfriend's and say  You know if you don't suck this  I'm going to knock his jaw off  I would be a bully and a creep  But he's a nice dude  He's a true friend too  He never forgot us  A lot of people forgot about us after we did what we did  Yeah some comedians even  A lot of people  We'll get into the list someday  But you know  He's the real deal  Really nice  Old friend 
[02:57:00]  I'm glad we could show him a good time  Always  God was she sexy  Buzz from Texas  What's up Buzz  Hey I just got three quick questions  Yeah go ahead  Hey did you ever get to spend quality time with  Why does it got a nickel in it  Oh well  Did you ever get to spend quality time with the porcelain god  Did Anthony ever win his wizard robe  And just set him up and ever get a paycheck  Alright did you take a dump Opie  No we talked about that this morning  I had four unbelievable dumps between 4 and 5 a.m. 
[02:57:30]  So I'm set I'm back to normal  And did you ever get your wizard robes  I'm annoyed  I'm questing for my wizard robe on EverQuest 2  And I've been in the crypt now for a couple of days  And I can't find a good big group to take on these ire minions  That I must kill  Because there's no good groups in there  There's not enough people  So I go in every night trying to find people  But it's very difficult  So no I do not have my wizard robe yet  But I'm working on it  And to answer your question  Did I get a paycheck yet 
[02:58:00]  No not to my knowledge  Okay thank y'all  You're welcome  Okay so Opie shit yes  Wizard robe no  Paycheck no  And it's good when you're looking for a mortgage  You know you're trying to get a mortgage  But your credit's a little fucked up  And you're having a problem getting a mortgage  You know  And you know  The less money you have in the bank to show  The better  I like when the listeners ask for updates by the way  Because that was easy  We start a lot of stupid little storylines  And never finish them  So there you go  I do have my profile up  By the way Opie 
[02:58:30]  If you go to the EverQuest 2 site  You can click on characters  On the players gallery and characters  And you can see a profile of my character Jax  And how many times is the word faggoty used in your profile  Um let me think  Faggoty  8  9  Yeah right  30  Alright  Let's uh  Let's say how to Lost Cause in Alabama  Lost Cause what's up  Hey what's going on Opie  Hey man  Hey Jimmy

Do you have to go through  And toil and go  That one's kind of funny  But not my pick  It's not up to the  My pick of the week standards  Yeah sometimes  I'll bring 20 or 30  I'm not working on my  Second Tonight Show  Sometimes I'll just bring  These jokes on stage  And try them to see  What the crowd decides on  Which one was this week's pick again?  This was Courtney Jefferson  From Franklin, New Jersey  Oh, old Courtney  And her joke  What has a lot of keys  But cannot open any doors? 
[03:05:30]  A lot of keys  I remember this because  The crowd split their sides  I bet  What has a lot of keys  A janitor with Down syndrome?  Now that would have been funny  Now that I would have picked  As one of Jim Norton's  Joke picks of the week  Right  But no  It's a piano  Oh  They've got keys  No, no  That's not true 
[03:06:00]  They mixed up two jokes  The answer for the piano was  What is the finest time  To see black and white  Next to each other?  Ding, ding, ding  Well that's even funnier  Than what you have in there  Well  Let's be honest  Do I pick those?  Jackie  Jackie Martling  Used to have that section  And then somebody contacted me  From stepping out a while ago  And said look  Jackie's not doing it anymore  Do you care if we put your face  And we'll give your website  A plug or whatever  And I'm  Jimmy the joke man  Norton  But I'm like  Yeah I didn't name it  Norton's nonsense

That's his first chance  Big Ten basketball  It's the Big Ten today  On XM Satellite Radio  It's Thursday, December 16, 2004  I'm Maggie Linton  With your Big Ten today  Big Ten!  Penn State has one of the youngest teams  In the Big Ten  But has somehow managed to claw  To a record of 5-4  With four freshmen  Four sophomores  Two juniors  And three seniors  Assistant coach Hillary Scott  Was asked what has impressed  The coaches the most  About this scrappy young team 
[03:15:00]  Well, I think one of the things  That we've been pleased with  Is just our overall team chemistry  Something we've preached  From day one  Something we've preached  Our attitude as a team  And the fact that we're trying  To play together  And we have a team  Full of very good guys  The Nittany Lions  Also have the country's  Fourth leading rebounder  In Aaron Johnson  The junior forward  Is coming back  From a season of injuries  And has accepted  The role of a leader  The last couple years  We've come across  Terrible luck  You know, the start of the season 
[03:15:30]  Last year  Had the detached retina  Where he missed  I think it was eight weeks  To start the season  Last year  And it took him a while  To get into the swing of things  And game speed  Getting back in shape  So he's had the whole summer  To really work on his game  Get into game shape  And I think his play  Has showed it this year  You know, he's not  The most athletic guy  You'll see out there  But he's one of those guys  That plays a lot  For energy  Enthusiasm  And he's also done  A heck of a job  On the rebound 
[03:16:00]  The side of it too  But he's been kind of  Our leader this year  On both ends  And our young guys  Feed off of Aaron  His enthusiasm  His work ethic  And we've been very pleased  With what he's done  With us so far this year  And we expect more and more  From as the season goes on  Penn State also  In the midst of finals  Doesn't play again  Until Tuesday  December 21st  Against the Buffalo Bulls  And that's the Big Ten  Today  On XM Satellite Radio  Big Ten

[03:24:00]  And every day  We're presented  With a bunch of things  That the listeners  Have sent in  And usually we go through  Everything  And decide  This is good  This is bad  This is  You know what I mean  Good  Bad  Or shit  Today we didn't really  Have time for that  And we have like  Four or five things  That came in  You want to kind of  Just play them on the air  And see what happens  Let's see what they sound like  All right  What do we got  Well the first thing  That came in  Is a rap song  Called Big Ass Titties  I have no idea what it is  A rap song called  Big Ass Titties 
[03:24:30]  Big Ass Titties  This is just stuff  That listeners decide  To send this program  Or Steve  Or yeah  You know  It's just kind of  Gathered on a daily basis  I mean the listeners  Are just amazing  At how they're helping us  Spread the virus here  So I mean  We won't play the whole thing  Unless it's really good  Let's give a little listen  But this came in  Overnight  It's Big Ass Titties 
[03:25:00]  It don't matter  If you C Cups  Or D Cups  Whatever  I'm trying to get in your ass  Without spinning my cheddar  Cause bitches know better  I'm hotter than a nigga  That's wearing four sweaters  Nine times out of ten  I'll leave that panty  Slow wetter  So do the math  Put it together  If you got big ass titties  I'm damn forever  Shit 
[03:25:30]  Man  I'm spinning my cheddar  Cause this bitch  Gats me titties  Like  Hey  Come on  Come on  Give me titties  Alright  Well  That was  High potential  Yeah  Not that funny though  Well no  It was just about  Talking about  Girls that have  Big ass titties  And he said  Cheddar in there  That's why you like it  Cause he said  He spends cheddar  Well cheddar  That was a word  You were using for a while  Well cheddar  Is old school  Now it's called paper  Paper  The second thing 
[03:26:00]  That came in  Is a Christmas song  That is sung to Connor  Yeah  We did listen to this one  Before the show  And we're still baffled  We're not really sure  If it's for Connor Peterson  Yeah cause I was told  Oh it's a Christmas song  To Connor Peterson  But it doesn't make sense  Because the girl singing  Talks about  It being to her father  But then she refers  To this Connor  As  As kind of like a child  Like getting him presents  That are kind of  Childlike things  So I don't know 
[03:26:30]  What the hell  This girl's  Maybe this is a  Like what  A scuba diving set  Maybe this is a  Pro Scott Peterson song  I don't think so  Maybe this lady  Thinks that Scott Peterson  Had nothing to do with this  And he's actually said  That his son is gone  And this is a song  About Connor  And his father  That's what I'm thinking  Yeesh  Let's hear it  Let's give it a listen  Let's give it a jingle  Touching  Haunting  At the same time  By the way  When we do this stuff 
[03:27:00]  We'll go with the minute rule  We have to decide  If it's good enough  Right  A minute in  If it is  We'll let it keep playing  If not  We'll yank it out  Of the CD player  Cause I don't want people  Thinking that  We're gonna play  This whole damn thing  No  And lose a listener  Good rule Opie  Thank you Jim  Remembering Lacey  Our smile made his smile  Can we get that again?  Alright here we go  Her life was full of lives  It's Christmas time  In California 
[03:27:30]  And everywhere  Are sounds of love and joy  You are my father  And I just want to say  With people like you in my life  The season feels so warm and bright  Merry Christmas  Connor  Yeah  It's not about the Peterson case  No it's not  Yeah because 
[03:28:00]  Alright  The father's name is Connor right?  That's what I'm getting  Yeah  Oh now I'm with you  That's what I was getting  From the beginning  But it doesn't make sense  Later on as the song goes on  Cause then she starts talking about  You know  For Christmas I'll get you  Diapers?  I don't know  Little lambs and stuff  Oh really?  I don't know what she talks about  Maybe your father's a penny waste  Wait let's listen a little bit more  Lamb loving motherfucker  Merry Christmas  Shit dick  May your dreams come true 
[03:28:30]  And may your Christmas star  Shine brightly where you are  I wish a merry merry Christmas  To you  Uh huh  Ugh  It is the season  Yeah  To be giving  And so I thought  What to get for you 
[03:29:00]  What to get for you  Maybe two ducks  Who can sing Silent Night  Two ducks  Or grab a crocodile or three  But instead I got this melody  Yeah  It's just a song to my father  A fucking two ducks  For your father  If my daughter gave me two ducks  I'd molest her all over again  You don't even know  Where your daughter is  I don't have any kids  For Pete's sake  Oh you have one out there somewhere  I'd like two ducks please  And it isn't a little odd 
[03:29:30]  That she's calling her father Connor  Perhaps it should be  Merry Christmas Daddy  Or something  Maybe she's like  Maybe  Well if Greg sang it  He would have  Happy Merry Christmas  Carol and Mike  At one point  It's the same thing  Merry Christmas  Carol and Mike  Do we know where that came from?  Sex Bagel?  Um  A guy named Hummer Cash  From uh  From Foundry?  From Foundry  And from Wack Bag  Sent it over  And he's like  Oh it's a  Connor Peterson Christmas song  And I listened to it too  What is he a douchebag?  I listened to it too  I was like  This doesn't make any sense  But 
[03:30:00]  Brought it in  Just cause it says  Connor in it  Yeah  And from California  It's a hell of a coincidence  At the very end  At the very end of the song  He goes  You're getting so big  I was like  The kids  Yeah  Hawk is right  Good point Birdman  Thank you  Caw  Damn it  Caw  Nice  Wings doesn't think  That that's one of those either  Alright well  We did get uh  Three more  Lacey songs in  Those are  Are they real songs  Or parodies?  I don't know  We haven't listened to them  We didn't have time today  I haven't heard these  We'll try the first one 
[03:30:30]  We Remember Lacey  Ah  Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  Yes  Already  Kenny G  Good already 
[03:31:00]  He lifted us when we were down  She laughed and hugged  And showed us how to love every child  She knew where she was headed  Yes she knew  And she knew  Someday she'd be gone  Gone straight to heaven 
[03:31:30]  My way up the ocean  Where princess angels  Live out  Horace  Horrible  Why am I getting none of these people on the phone?  I stink 
[03:32:00]  And I don't like it  With a star high in the sky  Her life will forever shine through  Alright alright  Enough of that one  Enough of that one  Why do we have none of these guys on the phone?  Yeah who is that guy?  Are we trying to get these people on the phone?  That are writing these stupid songs?  Can you go to drippynonsense.com and download that?  Huh?  Steve said he's been contacting them  And little luck 
[03:32:30]  Well instead it's the Greg and Tony show  Greg and Tony in New York or whatever  They want to have a yawn and talk about your song?  Are you trying to say we have a bad reputation as Opie and Anthony?  Your reputation stinks  You're lucky I come on  It really does  You guys are creeps  All you do is make Peterson jokes  If I wrote a tribute I wouldn't want it  Who?  The guys that had sex  Yeah I'm sure they want it  I haven't made one Peterson joke  You haven't  But you haven't turned mics off either  So you're equally responsible  You allowed the crimes to happen  You just tore down the third wall  Opie  You just tore down the third wall 
[03:33:00]  This is for you  You just broke one of the rules of the show  What was that?  You tore down the third wall  And explained what goes on here  What goes on here?  How did Lacey teach us to love by the way?  Um  I don't know  She taught me to laugh  I  Alright here's another Lacey song  It's just called Lacey Song  Lacey Song  Well that's the easiest way  Wait didn't we just play this?  More bells and sap 
[03:33:30]  Yes  There's one of the bells  There's the chains that were weighing her down  Bells equal  Smiling on the way down  Sap  It's your smiling face  That I can't  Did they say swollen face?  Your smiling face  Oh I think it was smiling  Opie  Let's see what it rhymed  By the way I think that constitutes a Lacey joke  Let's stop it and see if we can figure out what the rhyme's going to be after she says  It's your smiling face  That still sounds like swollen face 
[03:34:00]  It's your smiling face  Smiling face  Um  Now covered with tape  Oh  Oh  Well  If you continue  I  I don't know  That I can't erase  From my heart  That I can't replace  Alright  From my mind  That we hold together  Oh she's not even rhyming  It's the way you laugh 
[03:34:30]  It's the way you cry  What?  No one even knows how she laughs  Yeah  The warm embrace  Will hold me forever  Who's she hugging in anger?  Where's the chorus?  You are the light  Light in all  My darkness  What?  What?  Who?  Is this about Lacey? 
[03:35:00]  My heart is lost  Whining  Bitch  This is so bad  Your smile can reach around  The world  And call my name  This couldn't be about Lacey  Oh yeah  She did say smiling face  Did she say Lacey though?  I didn't hear one Lacey in that  Nah  These people just sent in love songs  Saying that they're tributes  Jack off 
[03:35:30]  Who sent that piece of crap in?  I want to get that guy on the phone  Who sang that one song  Remembering Lacey  We gotta hear it again  John Stark  We got another one?  Mama  This for you  The wood block  Very popular  The Lacey song  This might be the Remembering Lacey, right?  That's it?  The original?  Yeah, this is the original  Oh yeah, here's the one we love  Well, we gotta play it  All kidding aside, folks  All kidding aside  Remembering Lacey 
[03:36:00]  How her smile would make you smile  Remembering Lacey  How she loved there's no denial  How the angels hold her gently  And little Connor's with her too  And she smiles and says  We're alright  And we send our love to you  So full of life and happiness 
[03:36:30]  Was pretty Lacey's life  With little Connor on the way  Just made things seem so right  Still the two of them together  From the start to heaven's door  And she smiles and says  We love you  To the one she's loved before  The tears that fell 
[03:37:00]  Made flowers bloom  On earth in heaven too  And little Connor  Runs and picks them  Mama  These for you  Now the angels are preparing  Special tributes from afar  As you gaze into the heavens  Look, the Lacey Connor star 
[03:37:30]  The Lacey Connor reef  Alright  This song is awful  Oh, what a drippy douchebag 
[03:38:00]  God, are these people awful  Thanks  We're getting instant feedback  Thanks  I got that fucking song  Stuck in my head  For another day  Mama  These for you  These for you  That's what Scott said  This is for you  Was that the only other songs?  Yeah, we're done with this 
[03:38:30]  No more serious ones?  Yeah  We're done with this  Oh  Lacey Connor reef  These are horrible  Alright  I hope  I really  Hope that guy finds out  That your  Your vain attempt  At a heart tugger  Has given us  Hours and gales  Of laughter  Thank you  Stupid  Next tragedy  Maybe that one  Will take off  Yeah, maybe that one 
[03:39:00]  You can latch onto  And seem like  You're a concerned  Deep artist  You fuck  Oh, um  Sex Hoagie from  Whackbag.com  One of those songs  We just played  It's a pre-recorded song  From a website  That you plug names in  And it sends you  This personalized song  Oh  So they were trying  To be a little clever  And do the whole  Connor thing  That's interesting  Okay  Merry Christmas Connor  Yeah, it didn't really work  Because  It sounded like they were  I don't know  And the song stunk  I know  Who would send that  They probably  You're supposed to send that 
[03:39:30]  To a loved one  Like, hey dad  I didn't feel like  Getting you a gift  So I typed in your name  And this fucking squat  Belts out a melodramatic  Awful Christmas song  Dribble comes out  This email from  Cervic Construction  Says, hey Lacey  You scratched my anchor  Cold from Texas  What's up?  I'm a free play convert  And this has got to be  The most vile seven cents  I've ever spent  It really is awful  We agree  It's only seven cents a day, sir 
[03:40:00]  Hey man, I'm spreading the virus  Via the U.S. Postal Service  I'm a rural carrier  Oh, great  Nice, thank you  Thank you so much  Oh, you're welcome  Alright  Did he say rural carrier?  Mail carrier, by the way  Oh  Remembering Lacey  Smile and make your tongue  Like he built  Big build up  At the end  The lazy person  Star  And we'd all enjoy  Watching his trial  The verdict was death 
[03:40:30]  As they strap him  To the journey  And there's some angels  Waiting for you  On your journey  There's no angels  Unless it's like  Walking in prophecy  Now that would be  A fun angel to hang with  No one is watching her  And welcoming her  Like it's a big  Welcoming party in heaven  No  They see that shit  All the time  Get in line, bitch  Welcome to heaven  Stand in line  Aren't enough sweet angels 
[03:41:00]  To take care of every person?  Yeah  Let's have a party  In their honor  And coddle them  Hold them  She's in an angel's arms  Like a hot nightclub  You gotta be dressed right  You gotta be the right people  Exactly, no one's gonna want her in the club  That big fucking pregnant house coat  Dripping wet  Killing everybody's vibe  Jesus  We know who you are  We saw the news, big shot  She couldn't even go out anyway  She can't find a babysitter  A little Connor  Yeah, he's too young to get in  Yeah  But her smile can make us smile 
[03:41:30]  Yeah  Remembering the way she loved  How'd she love?  The lofts  Yeah, the laughs  Alright  Her laugh would drive you to murder her  This is a great little story  Robbers scared off by a Playstation game  And they get jail time  Really?  Yeah, this happened in Santa Fe, Anthony  A video game notorious for violence and mature content  May have actually saved the Santa Fe family  Back in March, Sandy Wilson was taking care of her three grandsons  When a group of men attempted to burglarize her home 
[03:42:00]  Pointing a gun at the kids  The children happened to be playing a video game called  Grand Theft Auto  The game has dozens of random police scanner messages  Which blare out calls such as  This is the police, you're surrounded  Believe it or not, Wilson says the burglars heard that message  Coming from the other room  And thought the police were outside the door waiting for them  Dopes  Well, the assistant DA is quoted  He said the police in the game were saying  Stop, we have you surrounded  This is the police  The burglar unknowingly thought this was the actual police 
[03:42:30]  And panicked being apprehended by Playstation  Thinking that it was pretty funny  Recalled young victim Chaz Fisher  How they were like  Ran off and they got all scared over a game  So they ran away and then they got caught  Police arrested the four men  Samuel Woodrow received a five year prison sentence this week  And Ronnie is serving four  And blah blah blah  The story goes on  Can I say it's a good thing he wasn't playing Pac-Man  Because he would have had to roll an orange in front of the burglars  Then he would have ran out  Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk 
[03:43:00]  Game over  Well, that's good  The game can save a life  I know when I was living in an apartment  Instead of a house  I was always scared to turn it up too loud  Because I was afraid somebody would call the cops  Because it really is kind of realistic sounding  You know, gunfire sound effects  Screaming  You know, when you start popping people's heads off  And you're hearing AK-47 fire  And loud screams through the big  I got one of those big subwoofers 
[03:43:30]  And nice sound systems  That really rattle the walls  I always thought somebody would call the cops on me  There's gunfire next door  Can't believe it  I believe somebody's driving a Chevy  Through some walls too  So I'm hearing car chases  Alright, we'll play this again  Remembering Benny  His gossip makes you smile  He's herking and jerking  And little Connor picks up his phone  And says, Mama, this for you 
[03:44:00]  And Ben just shakes his head  The Ben sparks messy hair  Remembering Ben's toilet  All the brown under the sea  It looked like Bosnia  As he shit and threw up on his feet  Yeah, I know this is a listen request 
[03:44:30]  A lot of requests for this Spongebob thing  Ben is puking  His bile made us smile  He combs his hair with a spiked bat  And his logs look like chocodiles  Well, they  All right  Yeah, they want to hear this  And Connor runs up with Pepto-Bismol  Benny, this for you  I do believe we came out of our slump today 
[03:45:00]  We were slumping a little bit there  Hey, we got the  Take it on a weekly average  Yeah, I understand  That's the beauty of this show  It gets really good  And then unfortunately it gets really bad  Fuck them  Yeah, fuck y'all  Fuck them  Now and forever  Lacey Peterson  The Spongebob song  Oh, I forgot about  Oh, this one's so wrong  We just gotta tell everybody  We understand how wrong this song is  What's wrong with it? 
[03:45:30]  It's just horrific  We understand that  This one could be a contestant  In the most offensive song contest  That we used to run  Right  Because it is very offensive  Very offensive  Yeah  We understand that, okay  But with that said  Let's all  Take a listen  To this  Are y'all ready, kids?  Hi, hi, Captain  I can't hear you  Hi, hi, Captain  Oh  Who lives in a body bag 
[03:46:00]  Under the sea  Lacey Peterson  Absorbent and bloated  And pregnant was she  Lacey Peterson  Where noise-eating, nagging  Scott won't miss  Lacey Peterson  Her and Connor  Are food for the fish  Lacey Peterson  Lacey Peterson  Lacey Peterson  Lacey Peterson  Lacey Peterson  From the killing  Okay, terrific 
[03:46:30]  He didn't go with the subtle approach  No  No, no  It's a bit harsh  Remembering Ben Stark  We called him Gravy Leg  Oh, Gravy Legs  All the pain he felt  In his asshole  Like he was passing  An egg  And Connor ran up  With a comb  And said 
[03:47:00]  Ben  This for you  Hey, who's this?  It's Lady Di  Lady Di  Who?  Oh  You remember me  Come on  Remembering Di's liver  No, no, no  I'm okay  I'm fine  I just called to wish you guys  A Merry Christmas  In case we don't see you  Or talk to you before that  Why, are you going to die before Christmas? 
[03:47:30]  No  I thought your phone was turned off  No, it's not turned off  Why?  Ah, well  It's not turned off  Did you pay it?  Uh-huh  Did you pay it?  I'm trying to  So you did?  I'm trying to pay  Whenever I can  When's the last time  You looked for a job?  The last time I looked for a job?  There's the answer  To the question  The other day  The other day?  What day?  The other day  What day was the other day?  The other day not meaning yesterday  But the day before yesterday  Uh-huh, that would be Tuesday  Where'd you go?  Well, I went over to  A place that I could waitress at 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, what's the name of the place?  I'm not going to tell you the name of the place  Because you're lying  I'm not lying  You are  What is the name of the place  You applied to be a waitress?  It's a restaurant in Garwood, New Jersey  You're a liar  That's all I'm going to tell you  Why are you protecting the identity  Of a stupid restaurant?  Yeah, they turned you down anyway  They were afraid no one would eat  No, I gave them my phone number  Hi, how are you?  Everything is turning down  Nothing like that  Alright, so you looked at that restaurant  Where else have you looked this week? 
[03:48:30]  Um, let me see  Where else?  Just say nowhere  No, no, no  I did look in a couple places  She's got to think  Make something up in her head  I did look in a few places  You're not a good liar  Everybody  Everybody  Let's get into it  Get stoked  I'm all  Get retarded  I'm all  Get retarded  Get retarded  Everybody  Oh boy  Let's get retarded  Let's get retarded  Yeah  Yeah  Let's get retarded  In here  Let's get our phone shut off 
[03:49:00]  Let's get retarded  In here  Let's get retarded  I said Merry Christmas to you.  To all of you over there.  You got a Christmas tree in the house?  You know what?  Not yet, but I will get one.  No, you're not.  There's one upstairs in my attic anyway.  You're going to wind up sitting there and hanging bulbs off your pubes.  No.  Calling it a Christmas sewer.  Is that guy still living with you that punched you in the face? 
[03:49:30]  No one punched me in the face.  Why did he sock you in the jaw?  No one socked me.  I told you I fell.  Yeah, she fell off the treadmill that she didn't know what she was talking about.  It's so out of the way, a treadmill.  I fell on the treadmill.  That's what happened.  So you were on the treadmill and what happened?  And I fell.  I fell on my chin and not only that, but I also fell on my knee also.  I had a bruise on my knee.  So you were working out.  Wait, wait.  I don't know what I'm bringing that up for.  Wait, but I think it's good that you were working out at least a little bit. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, just a little bit.  Oh, my God.  You lying sack of shit.  Anthony, you're Columbo.  You're Columbo, buddy.  You can't stop it.  When was the last time you told us that you weren't working out and then you were walking  and you tripped over it?  And you tripped over it.  You can't stop it.  Because last time we asked you, when was the last time you used the treadmill?  And you said, I hadn't used it in a long, long time.  And then we said, I thought you fell off of it.  And you said, no, I was walking near it and I tripped and fell on it.  And now you're saying you were using the treadmill. 
[03:50:30]  All right, all right.  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  That's exactly what happened.  What you just said, Anthony.  That's exactly what happened.  I was not on the treadmill, I was on the porch, and I tripped on a cord.  She just lies and lies and lies.  Why are you lying to you?  You just said you were working out.  You just said that.  You lie like a rug.  You really do.  I figured I'd say that, but no, no, no.  That's a lie.  That wasn't the case.  Then why would you think you'd say it if it wasn't true?  Liar, liar, you made your pants out of Steve's shirt. 
[03:51:00]  What does that mean?  You just laughed at...  I have no idea what that means.  Of course.  But she laughed.  Yeah, just laughed.  Uncomfortably.  I still laugh.  That's all right.  Why do you lie so much?  Why is there no honesty with you?  You know that she covers up her stupidity with laughter?  Yeah.  Like you'll tell her something, and you know she has no idea what you're talking about,  so she'll just laugh?  You're a compulsive liar.  Marion.  Hi, how you doing?  Hi, Lady Di's on the phone.  Hi, Diane.  Marion, listen to me.  Tell them I've been looking for a job.  Diane, you have been looking for a job. 
[03:51:30]  Okay.  Now, both of us are liars now?  No, she is looking for a job.  I sent her to the Jersey Gardens Mall the other day.  Oh, yeah?  And?  Yeah.  And she filled out some applications.  She's a liar.  How do you know?  Because I know she did.  How do you know?  Did she just tell you?  Because she's a compulsive liar.  No, no, I know.  I thought she hopped on the bus, and she went to the Jersey Gardens Mall and put some applications  in.  Hey, Marion.  She's just on the bus.  Yeah.  Does her lying bother you, her constant lying?  No, no.  Jimmy, she has been looking for work. 
[03:52:00]  About the treadmill and stuff.  I mean, just in general.  Hey, Marion, by the way, Lady Di finally admitted today that she got punched in the face.  No, I did not.  I did not get punched in the face.  Because I got news for you.  The guy that's subject already, I just got punched in the face.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy that's staying with her, he's a nice guy.  All right.  He's a really, really nice guy.  I wouldn't say it wouldn't be a nice guy that would punch her in the mouth.  No, no, no.  Of course he's nice.  She drove him to it.  Is Lady Di banging this guy, Marion?  No, he's not.  So why is he living there?  Because he's a friend, and he offered to pay half of the rent. 
[03:52:30]  Not half of it.  Well, some of it.  You know.  A quarter of it.  And he's helping her out.  With some of her bills.  All right.  I mean, he really is a nice guy with the rest of it.  I've had talks to him on the phone a lot.  All right.  There you go.  The retard Laverne Shirley, everyone.  But the guy is just a friend.  Bye.  In here.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded in here. 
[03:53:00]  That's a good one, isn't it?  Let's get retarded in here.  It's a toe tapper.  I like that.  It certainly is.  They're gone.  Don't worry about it.  What a compulsive liar.  It's awful.  She just cannot tell the truth.  So, where'd you look for a job?  Where'd I look for a job?  And then our little pea brain is just rattling on a mile a minute trying to come up with an answer.  A brontosaurus brain.  Oh.  Just trying to pick vegetation off the tall trees and think of where she could say she looked for a job. 
[03:53:30]  Old walnut brain.  Oh.  Hope a tyrannosaurus doesn't come out and just rip her throat out.  A tyrannosaurus?  A tyrannosaurus.  What a mess.  All right.  Well.  Liar.  We're just about done today.  We're going to play What Did We Learn?  Yes.  What did we learn?  Yeah.  I know.  Oh.  It was such an educational program.  I just want to remind people tomorrow's going to be a great show.  I do believe.  Our eggnog drinking contest for a MiFi.  What if I could bring something in to like a respirator or something so I don't have to smell puke? 
[03:54:00]  Ben, are we all set for tomorrow?  Smelling puke gets me pukey.  We got the eggnog and all that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll get it all.  Oh.  I don't know.  I was very relaxed about the whole thing.  When are we going to get the eggnog, Ben?  Relax, Jim.  All right.  And will we have enough?  Yes, we'll have enough.  Okay.  We'll leave the eggnog behind the toilet.  Yes.  And is Club Soda Kenny coming tomorrow?  Yeah.  Wait till you see the latest Club Soda Kenny email that I just read.  They're not answering him back. 
[03:54:30]  No, no.  This doesn't even have to do with Washington.  This just has to do with you and Anthony getting to the studio tomorrow.  It's pretty funny.  Oh, really?  And me and Jim.  How we're all getting to the studio.  Really?  Well, he's...  No, I just think it's funny.  To me, it's funny.  He thinks of everything.  I don't know.  I like Club Soda Kenny for that.  Kenny's just sending so many emails now.  It just cracks me up because, you know...  I want a rickshaw.  I want a rickshaw from the garage to the studio.  How about that?  It's not a bad idea.  Maybe we can paint XM on it and take it to Vegas on the rickshaw city tour. 
[03:55:00]  That'll save some money.  Yeah, we'll talk about the tour bus idea with Kevin in a few minutes.  What's it talking about?  No.  We got our meeting in a few minutes here, so...  All right, so the eggnog drinking contest, real easy.  If you want in on the contest, you just show up at the station tomorrow morning, right?  Nice and early with food for Martini Steve and toilet paper for Ben.  Right.  And we're going to invite 10 people up here to drink eggnog.  It's a double shot of eggnog every minute until you puke.  I was just... 
[03:55:30]  The best guy standing that obviously did not puke will win the MiFi, the portable XM satellite radio that everyone is talking about this season.  Can I ask you a question?  Yes.  Why is 1971 Donald Sutherland sitting out here?  Wow.  That's a good one.  Who are those guys?  More Eric's friends.  Eric has some creepy friends.  They're filming the remake of Kelly's Heroes.  You think Eric's friends?  Who's creepier, Eric's friends, or the guy Steve knew that looked like Jerry Garcia?  Oh, Steve knew Uncle Ricky?  Of course.  Do you mean Kelly as in... 
[03:56:00]  Oh, you didn't.  You didn't find that guy.  I thought you knew Uncle Icky.  You didn't know Uncle...  No, that was actually a Danny find.  Danny found him.  How is Aunt Icky doing?  Is she good?  Singing her for the holidays?  All right.  What else do we need to tell the listeners about tomorrow, Steve?  We're going to invite another 15 people just to check out the festivities?  Yeah.  I think we can fit another 15, 20 people in here comfortably just as observers.  But 10 people in here drinking eggnog is going to get pretty crowded.  You guys got a lot of garbage pails?  Yeah.  I talked to the guys here today to take care of it. 
[03:56:30]  Eric's going to pick up the eggnog in the morning.  Okay.  And we'll have a lot of it.  Hey, maybe we should have some of those little pine car air fresheners hanging on the cans or something.  You know, do us a favor.  Bring some Lysol tomorrow.  I know we have two or three, but...  Talked about that also as well.  We'll have a lot of Lysol.  Yeah, that's right.  Maybe some air fresheners.  Some old spice in a rag.  Something.  All right.  Let's play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Todd the Trucker.  What's up, Todd?  Morning, Ope.  Morning, Ant. 
[03:57:00]  Morning.  Morning, Tushy Spanker.  Good morning, baby doll.  Hey, I learned that Jimmy Norton's going to be at the downtown December 23rd for the  Naughty Norton's Christmas.  And to find out more, you can go to www.eatabullet.com or contact him if you have a thumb for a clit  at yellowtreat.aol.com.  That was as complete a What Did We Learn as I've ever heard of a fine contribution.  And that email address, yellowtreats.aol, is for the ladies.  That is for the ladies. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, guys, you can say hello, too.  I don't exclude them.  I try to answer everybody on email.  No, it's for the ladies.  You just be nice on the show.  No, no, I'm a creep.  If you want Norton to bang you, just give me an email at yellowtreats.aol.  Watch it out, guys.  What was the one that AOL threw you off?  Oh, right after we got kicked off, Tinkle Drinker was my old one.  Tinkle Drinker was his old one, and AOL said no.  Well, I didn't have a mailing list.  I now have a mailing list on my website, but I wanted to send out a mass mailing to talk  about our situation, and AOL flagged it and booted me.  A thousand emails I had, which is as many as you can get on email. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Mike from Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I learned today that the guy that cleans Jim's apartment is retarded and hops around  on one leg.  Yeah, we did learn that.  Very nice.  Jim from West Virginia.  Go ahead, Jim.  Jim?  Yeah, I'm here.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I said I learned today that Jim Norton smacked her on the button.  I had to pay for it.  Ah, you didn't have to pay for that.  She had a nice little ass.  You don't pay for spankings or anything, do you?  No.  Or a spank chick? 
[03:58:30]  Please, no.  Rob from Long Island?  Just to smell the numbers.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  How's Jimmy the Mouth doing today?  Right.  Yeah, I learned that Big Duty's bent six fingernails in his cell phone.  You know, it's crazy.  It's insane.  I love it.  People are starting to get it.  Thank you.  Big Duty.  It looked like Connor, but taller.  Jim, can you give us one more Ben rumor, please?  It's starting to be my favorite thing on the show.  Dude, my friend Psycho Tim was telling me that Tom Brady fucked Lacey right before Frank.  She was in Boston, Frank. 
[03:59:00]  It was fucking crazy.  They didn't make the papers, but, you know, we all got to keep it quiet.  Don't say anything.  Dude, fucking Boston cops.  I'm not fucking with the fucking cops.  The Boston police were involved.  Everyone knows that.  Dude, it was really crazy.  Hello?  Everyone in Boston knows.  Oh, he's leaving.  How's it going?  Wait, give me that fan and rake.  I've got to fix my hair.  It's too neat.  You know, Ben hates that, but it's my favorite thing on the show these days.  Yeah, Ben knows.  It really is.  He's going to his little cubicle.  Charles from Jersey, what's up?  That's why he messes it up, because he's always jerky and jerky.  He's like, hold on, hold on. 
[03:59:30]  I'm sorry.  I stepped over everybody.  Because Ben's like, I've got to grab that.  That's why his papers are so messy.  Let's say how to Fast Eddie.  Fast Eddie, what's up?  Hey, man.  Today I learned that Triple H is a little pussy whip.  You know what I'm saying?  That is so true.  Speaking of Triple H, he's told us something off air that I really want to tell everyone.  Don't tell him.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, this is the game, Triple H.  You are listening to the kings of satellite, Opie and Anthony.

[04:02:00]  Ooh, hot.  I had that game Operation.  Remember that game Operation?  Big naked white guy.  He had no pee-pee at all.  He had no...  He was like that guy from the movie Silence of the Lambs.  Remember?  He tucked it in.  Put the lotion in the basket. 
[04:02:30]  Put the lotion in the basket!  You're laughing because you've done it, you freak.  You're a freak.  You're a freak.  I used to do it.  I used to come out of my girlfriend's bathroom naked.  I'd be like, look, I'm just like you.  I was always afraid.  Like, one time she'd be like, oh, yeah?  Wah.  I'm just like you!  I'm just like you!
