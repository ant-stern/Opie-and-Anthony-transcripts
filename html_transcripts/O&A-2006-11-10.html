<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic skit about a fictional "O&A virus," before transitioning to a discussion of the cramped studio, with Anthony complaining about his microphone setup and limited space.  This led to a conversation about Anthony attending a one-year-old's birthday party and the challenges of gift-giving, juxtaposed with Opie's upcoming smaller Florida Christmas trip compared to his previous large family celebrations.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, then reviewed films, including Russell Crowe's "A Good Year," Will Ferrell's "Stranger Than Fiction," and the wildly successful "Borat,"  discussing the lawsuit against the "Borat" filmmakers.  Tangents included Anthony's dislike of children and his inventive avoidance strategies, and a revisit of a past confrontation with a New York weatherman, referencing a similar photo from the previous year. The segment included listener calls, a "Guess the Sound" game, and a recurring show bit. Planned guests included Frank Caliendo, Jeff Daniels, Bob Saget, and Tom Papa.  Various audio clips were played, including anti-smoking commercials (including Flintstones-themed ones) and the song "Cancer Box."  The broadcast also promoted the Opie and Anthony "Walkover Talent Show."

The show continued with a discussion about the attractiveness of cartoon characters (Wilma and Betty Rubble), leading to a caller-based segment naming the hottest cartoon character.  Jim Norton, among others, offered his choices.  A caller's story about a John Wayne cigarette advertisement triggered speculation about Wayne's death, including unsubstantiated claims of nuclear exposure. The caller abruptly hung up, prompting an angry reaction from the hosts. This transitioned to a video of a woman being tased while singing "Sweet Home Alabama," followed by more speculation on John Wayneâ€™s and other actors' cancer deaths.  A "Scary News Teases" segment followed, featuring fear-mongering clips about cancer links to hiccups, predator laws and religion, and concentrated sex offender housing.  Studio guests Jeff Daniels (who later performed a song about being killed by Clint Eastwood) and phone calls from Frank Caliendo and Bob Saget were featured.  The segment included another "Guess the Sound" game, a discussion about texting while driving (disguised as a news tease), a bit about New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina, and a news tease about a body part in a Subway sandwich.  The discussion frequently veered into profane and crude jokes, including lengthy, offensive commentary about Jeff Daniels' interactions (or lack thereof) with Derek Jeter and other celebrities. More "Scary News Teases" and announcements of upcoming guests and segments concluded this portion.


The next segment began with a conversation with Bob Saget about his role in "The Aristocrats,"  its explicit nature, and a proposed "One vs. 100" segment featuring "ONA pests" and other contestants. Saget discussed a negative review of his stand-up, highlighting the contrast between his "Full House" persona and his current raunchier act, sharing anecdotes including a disturbing fan encounter.  Jeff Daniels then joined the show.  A large portion focused on a "Guess the Sound" game, with increasingly absurd listener guesses.  The segment transitioned into the hosts' vulgar and sexually suggestive post-show "walk-over" to their Sirius XM studio, including a prolonged, impromptu game called "Poke the Witch" with a female fan. This involved graphic sexual discussions, descriptions of pornographic magazines, and highly inappropriate behavior.  The segment concluded with promotions for Saget and Daniels' upcoming shows and appearances, along with further promotional information and a final, vulgar discussion.


A subsequent excerpt promoted the "Holiday Havoc 06" event, listing participating bands (Deptones, Papa Rhodes, Lost Prophets, and mentioning Willie Nelson). A crude, sexually explicit segment followed, featuring a station employee, Travis, writing the station's call letters on a host's buttocks with a marker (later lipstick).  This was filmed, accompanied by vulgar banter and sexual innuendos. The hosts then discussed an incident filming at MSNBC, detailing Anthony's inappropriate behavior during Joe Scarborough's interview with President Bush's sister.  The conversation turned to hidden microphones in studios, including a prank call anecdote.  A listener call preceded comedian Tom Papa's arrival, his lateness becoming a topic of discussion.  Humorous descriptions of stereotypical B-roll footage and further sexually explicit conversations followed, concluding with another attempt to guess a Japanese game show sound clip.


The final segment focused on Opie's tumultuous new relationship, recounting an argument where he called his girlfriend a "selfish old piece of shit," a phrase he later confirmed he meant.  Discussions about differing movie tastes and perceived age differences followed.  The hosts addressed listener-submitted guesses for a mystery sound, ranging from ludicrous to offensive.  They discussed Walmart allowing "Merry Christmas" greetings again, sparking debate about political correctness. Opie expressed his political leanings and desire for a return to politically incorrect humor. A video of a deer in a Target store was mentioned.  Tom Papa, a friend of Opie's, joined as a guest, discussing his friendships with Jerry Seinfeld and Rob Zombie, recounting an anecdote about Seinfeld unintentionally ignoring him.  Papa also discussed his career and encounters with Clint Eastwood. The show concluded with continued attempts to guess the mystery sound, promotions for Tom Papa and Francine's upcoming shows, a bit featuring a local news team's disastrous Halloween costumes, and a brief, unrelated segment featuring a female contestant answering questions incorrectly in a deliberately silly manner.  The mystery sound remained unsolved.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony and James Norton.  I've got some bad news.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease,  fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too rage.  Jesus Christ, five hours? 
[00:00:30]  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation. 
[00:01:00]  Where is this frantic?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  O.B.  O.B.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Oh.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You all right over there? 
[00:01:30]  Pain in the ass.  My little friggin' cubicle.  You need more room over there.  Oh.  Now today the mics are really bassy.  Wow.  Why can't we have the mics sounding the same way every day?  Someone's got to change everything.  There's a lot of bass in my microphone today.  Ah, whatever.  We're...  I was going to say we're back. 
[00:02:00]  No, we're here.  We're starting.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  Good morning.  Hi.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Settled in over there?  Yeah, I think so.  My postage stamp that I sit at.  This has to be bigger.  This just...  I need a little more room for stuff. 
[00:02:30]  I have to, like, jockey things around in the morning.  Because I guess whatever other shows are using this are fine with whatever size this is.  But there's, like, stuff I don't use.  Like, I don't use the phones.  But I like seeing who's on the phones.  But I don't, like, take the calls.  So I don't need that mouse that's there.  But that was wrapped around my headphones five times.  So I ripped it out and swear I was almost going to fling it right at the wall. 
[00:03:00]  I was hoping...  I wasn't going to stop you.  I shouldn't have...  I thought you were going to break the computer.  No, I was just going to, like, wing the mouse and smash it on the table here.  Oh, okay.  Because every morning I come in, that mouse is wrapped around my headphone cord and sitting right here.  And other things have to go here that wind up falling off this table halfway through the show.  Like, I'm littered at my feet with stuff that has fallen on the floor. 
[00:03:30]  Jimmy's got, like, a little shelf area there, but it's spread out.  Jimmy has a lot more area than you.  I have more room than both of you guys.  I don't need it.  All I need is a little bit of room.  You're welcome to put your stuff in my area.  No hopes, God.  The most room out of everybody.  I do not.  You've been around.  You've got that over there.  But how...  All right.  It's no fault of yours.  Oh, look.  It's that King Crap had to have his own frigging mission control in front of him while his  flunky sat at postage stamp posts.  Let me show you how this works.  You're saying I have a lot of room, right?  I have, first of all, seven inches in front of me, like a ledge or something. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Seven inches across.  Wow.  Seven inches wide, I mean.  Impressive.  Three feet long.  Yeah.  And now you're saying I have all this room over here.  But you've got that over there.  Well, how do I use this?  I go over here to use my other space?  But that's okay.  You can at least...  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  You can at least get to, like, something.  If you need to roll over and get to it.  It's useless because there's no mic over here. 
[00:04:30]  I had to pull over a table that looked like it was from Rikers.  Who cares there's a counter over here?  It's useless.  You can bring your mic over there and talk from there.  It'd be, like, doing a different show.  We should have, like, a thing where we're all in different areas one day.  It'd be funny.  This has got to be...  This is the dumbest thing.  I should have let you throw that through the computer.  That would have been great.  Oh, I was...  Yeah, why'd you stop him, man?  I was a microsecond away.  I just related to the rage.  As you're pulling the mouse out, I can see you, like, ready. 
[00:05:00]  I've gotten that up before.  And then you just punch the inanimate object.  And then you grit your teeth.  And then you're like, why did I do that?  I don't get an eye on your computer.  Yeah.  But that really was a codependent...  That was a fat girl thing I did.  Oh, T.E., don't break it.  I should be shot.  What a douche I am.  I should have put some curlers in my hair.  I'm a hole.  I'm a hole on this show.  You are the hole right there.  Oh, boys, don't break things.  Now, now, that costs money.  And I'm sitting here hoping he's going to come on to my side for a while.  Oh, yeah.  You were rooting for him. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, man.  It was like watching Nicholson strangle Nurse Ratched.  You were like Christopher Lloyd.  I remember that moment.  Yeah.  Gritting and nodding for...  All right.  Why the anger?  Ant, you look a little uptight.  What's wrong?  Not much.  I was talking in the office.  I got a birthday party to go to tomorrow.  Oh.  Oh, that's very nice.  Yeah.  Birthday.  I had to ask Opie.  Someone's 30th? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, that'd be fun because then you'd be popping some beers and talking and laughing and having  some fun and...  No.  It's a one-year-old.  Yeah?  It's a birthday party for one.  As I ask Opie, you know, I go, you got a big family and stuff and they've had kids  and everything.  What do you do?  What do you get a one-year-old?  It's easy.  Baby Gap gift certificate.  Done.  And he said Baby Gap gift certificate.  Done.  Oh, that is brilliant.  Or...  Or?  Toys R Us. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  For what?  What am I going to get there?  I don't know.  I'll let them figure it out.  No, another...  Something can swallow.  Dude, are you insane?  You go there, you get another gift certificate.  By the way, yes, but what?  Just get a gift certificate.  It's all about gift certificates.  Oh, gift certificates.  That's all I've given anybody in the past, like, 10 years.  Oh, we're heading into the holiday season.  That's what it's become now.  It's like, here's all your gift certificates.  I'll take mine.  Thank you.  Happy holidays.  Let's have some eggnog.  Do you know I'm actually leaving for Christmas this year? 
[00:07:00]  What do you mean?  I'm leaving.  Usually, I have the big Christmas Eve at my aunt and uncle's house, and all family comes  over, and there's this huge exchange of gifts that takes place at, like, the ungodly hour,  1 a.m., when everyone's hammered.  And it's just year after year.  And we've all suggested, how about we just do, you know, we pick one person and do that  kind of almost grab bag kind of thing, instead of lugging 20, 25 gifts up the stairs and 
[00:07:30]  the tree and the whole living room is full of, oh, it's just the worst.  Can I be your psychologist?  You understand what's going on here, right?  What?  The whole family probably wants to do the grab bag thing.  Yeah.  But you're the dude with all the money, so they don't, they want to receive all the  great gifts every year from you.  Damn it.  That is the only reason you're not into grab bag land.  All I've gotten them, though, in the past has been American Express-like gift cards.  See, this is the mistake you made.  Like, well, it's not your fault, by the way. 
[00:08:00]  We went into grab bag mode in my family many years before I became rich and famous.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  So they can't, like, they can't adjust the holiday.  You can't go back now.  No, you can't go backwards.  Yeah.  See, your family should be in grab bag mode, but they see all these great gifts you're  giving every year.  I've heard it over the years.  Large flat screen TVs and cold hard cash in the thousands of dollars.  Well. 
[00:08:30]  I saw you once just handing cash over to your sister for her birthday.  Yeah, I gave her a big basket of cash.  And it wasn't like, yeah, exactly.  It wasn't like a couple hundred dollars.  It was a big basket of cash.  Oh, it was her 40th.  So I gave her, like, 100 bucks a year for her 40th birthday.  That's pretty nice.  4,000, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's a lot of money.  That's her 40th.  It was a big one.  Jimmy's all confused over there.  I don't know why.  I wouldn't mind 3,900 in July.  I don't need to give a number.  Hell, now that I'm turning 55, all of a sudden, Opie's not a college boy anymore. 
[00:09:00]  I know.  I thought you wanted 2,100, sweetie.  I love the fact that me and Opie just gave up after.  We tried it.  I think we tried it for a year, maybe two.  And it was always like our exes were involved in some way, shape, or form in the whole shopping  process of, you know, Opie and Anthony are going to exchange gifts for Christmas.  Did we ever exchange?  I think we did at one point. 
[00:09:30]  But who cared?  And then we just say, you know something, dude, screw this.  It's just one more hassle that you don't have to go through on the holidays.  I hate Christmas.  It's already starting to well up.  Like you see that you get the things in the mail and the decorations start going up and  it's not even Thanksgiving yet.  And you start thinking, oh, my God, I only got how many weeks?  How many weeks left?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I saw the start of Christmas decorations just before Halloween. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  On the Upper West Side and a few of the stores.  Yeah.  Just before Halloween.  Yeah.  Because once you see them, you get that mindset where, oh, crap.  Got to go out shopping.  Got to start shopping now.  Got to do it.  I'm going to do it early this year.  This year I'm going to be done.  But and where are you Christmas Eve?  Running through a mall like a mad person just getting anything.  Oh, I'll get the stupid slippers for grandma again.  Oh, these gloves are good. 
[00:10:30]  And you just get the crap that no one uses.  By the way, when you get your grandma the same thing every year, she's not appreciative.  Of course she isn't.  She wants something really nice, too.  So where are you going to be Christmas?  That's where I guess you were getting at.  Oh, we're just bugging out and going down to Florida.  By yourselves?  Yeah.  We're just spending Christmas in the happiest place on earth.  Ugh.  You and your Disney obsession.  You like Disney?  I love going to Disney. 
[00:11:00]  Ew.  It's fun.  It's not fun.  It's fun.  It's clean.  The people are all nice.  It's creepy.  They're all nice.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  For someone who hates kids, you spend a lot of time in Disney.  That really is weird, dude.  You know something?  You don't even deal with the kids.  And there really aren't a lot of little kids, little annoying kids there.  The kids that are there, well-behaved.  It's not like going to something like Universal Studios down there, which, you know, if you 
[00:11:30]  leave the Disney compound and go adventure out to like Universal Studios, you realize  that's what the real world is like.  You get a reminder.  Oh, yeah.  Cutting and a reminder of my racism because of the cutting in line that goes on.  But then you get into Disney, everything.  There's little guys dressed up with little straw hats and mustaches sweeping the streets  at all hours.  Ant doesn't want to live in the real world.  They just sweep the streets and there's music playing it. 
[00:12:00]  And the whole place smells like cinnamon and sugar-coated nuts.  Oh, it's wonderful.  And then why travel the world when you got the Epcot Center?  You could just go to, hey, look, it's just like England.  I'm at a pub and I'm drinking a Guinness.  And then you walk down and where are you?  You're in Japan.  Gong.  It's the country we all know you want to go to.  Yeah, really.  Germany.  It's a wonderful display.  But for some reason, they skip a couple of years there in the German pavilion. 
[00:12:30]  It's all about, like, later hosing and glass blowing.  And then they go right up to now.  1930 to 1945, this is an under-construction sign, huh?  Yeah, they really don't want to acknowledge that for some reason.  It's not the Disney way.  And then fireworks every night and laser shows.  Do you go on roller coasters and stuff?  I'll go on a couple of them. 
[00:13:00]  I don't like going upside down in roller coasters, but I'll do things like Space Mountain and things like that.  Or in Disneyland, the Matterhorn bobsled and things like that.  It's going to be fun watching you go crazy the next few years, man.  Slowly but surely.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty very slowly, though.  Yeah, nice and slow.  We don't want to have it all at once.  That's how I like going.  I like that.  Nice and slow.  So you have to go to a kid's party, because I helped you out with that.  Yeah, one-year-old, so I guess that's tomorrow.  Right.  So I guess Baby Gap gift certificate will work. 
[00:13:30]  But for someone who hates kids, you're stuck going to kids' parties and stuff.  Well, it's my cousin, Anthony, who's a really good guy.  So I'm not going to diss him by not showing up for his party.  But he realizes you don't like kids, right?  Everyone knows I don't like kids.  Yeah, okay.  They hear it.  I don't go around smacking him in the head when I see him.  Do you kiss the baby?  I'm tolerant of kids.  No, I don't kiss babies.  Do you hold babies?  No.  No, people are always doing that. 
[00:14:00]  It's like that Seinfeld episode.  Hold the baby.  Anthony, hold the baby.  I don't hold babies.  They go to hand them to me, and I'm just all awkward.  And then when I â€“ there have been rare occasions where I have, like, held the baby,  and then everyone laughs at how I'm holding it.  Because they're like, look how stiff he looks.  Yeah, they're looking at my pants.  But they go, look, he can't even hold them right.  Look, he doesn't know what he's doing.  Yeah, that's why I said I don't want to hold the goddamn baby. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at this shot right here.  This is the exact shot last year.  Hey, you're right.  That ended our assault on the media campaign.  Bill Evans, the weather guy, is in front of Radio City with the Rockettes and Santa Claus.  Right.  And this is where â€“ who came running out?  Was it No Filter, Paul?  I think it might have been No Filter, Paul.  I'm not sure.  But they pretty much pinned him against the wall and started screaming at him.  And then this guy, this weather geek in New York here, ratted us out.  Yeah.  And he apparently knows some people. 
[00:15:00]  He actually called Eric Logan and said, look, man, I like those guys.  I listen to those guys, and I like to have fun like anyone else.  But I was scared for my life.  Scared for your life.  And I guess this is Channel 7, and I don't know.  They were trying to make this huge deal with someone named Oprah Winfrey.  Next thing you know, they told us that we will stop or we will be fired.  But this is the exact shot from last year with the Rockettes in front of Radio City Music Hall that ended it all. 
[00:15:30]  Anyway, I came up with a suggestion.  Did you like my suggestion to get you out of all kid parties, to get you to never have to interact with a child again?  No, I listened to your suggestion.  I don't think it's a viable one.  Why?  Was it Megan's Law?  It's close.  Well, because he was bitching.  He's like, look, I had a nice weekend plan, but we got two kid parties to go to this weekend.  A separate one.  So my girlfriend's got to go upstate for her sister's daughter's two-year-old party. 
[00:16:00]  And I have to stay down here for my cousin's one-year-old.  Why don't you both just send a card and say, when you're old enough to read this, I'll buy you something.  Yeah, there you go.  You got to go for the parents.  But I told Anthony, next time he has kids in his house, just work in a little diddle.  Nothing too crazy.  Just enough where the kids don't want any part of you.  Just enough where the kids, yeah, when it's suggested they go over to Uncle Anthony's house. 
[00:16:30]  They get scared.  They get scared and go, they don't want to go to Uncle Anthony's house.  I don't know.  Not to traumatize the kid through their 30s or anything.  Just enough to keep them away.  That's a fine line because it could also work that I won't have to send gifts because I'm in jail.  That's why the diddle's got to be just right.  How about just some leg tickles?  Just some thigh tickles.  That's harmless.  You do some thigh tickling.  I think bite off a toe.  It's something they'll remember for the rest of their life. 
[00:17:00]  Spit it in their face.  It's like a chimp coming off anesthesia.  Just sink your teeth into a digit.  Bite his toe off.  All right, well.  Yeah, so I got that, but that's good.  That'll work.  That's wonderful, Anthony.  Okay.  We got lots to do today.  Baby Gap gift certificate.  On the show today, Frank Caliendo.  Also, Jeff Daniels.  Jeff Daniels coming in studio today.  That's very cool.  Our buddy Bob Saget, who called yesterday and we didn't get to him because we were so busy.  And Tom Papa will be on the show later this morning. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  I got a little something I want to play for you guys.  You got to try to figure out what it is.  How does that sound?  All right.  Oh, I like games.  All right.  I like games.  I like games.  Every step of the game, and I'm going to be there for the great magic.  There's no one.  Wow!  Wow!  Wow! 
[00:18:00]  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  I don't know what that is, but I hope it involves a U.S. soldier, a flamethrower, and a cave. 
[00:18:30]  I think it's a home video outtake from John Liu's house.  Did he just curse? I don't think so.  I know what that is. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, what is it, Jim?  It's a screening of the Deer Hunter in Japan.  Any guesses?  Guess the sound.  Guess the sound on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:19:30]  What a dopey language.  I know what it is.  What is it, Jimmy? 
[00:20:00]  20 minutes of John Panette's act.  All right, we'll play Guess the Sound after the break.  Yeah.  To have a guess for that.  And we got lots of other things to do.  We have more audio of the gay kid from Ugly Betty.  Yeah, yeah.  The little...  Is he the brother?  What is he?  I guess he's the younger brother of Ugly Betty.  I don't know.  We'll get into that next.  Also, we got the Cancer Box song.  We got lots to do today, man.  Oh, we got to play that, right?  It's Friday.  Yeah, absolutely.  And let's not forget, Jimmy's playing the Hammerstein Ballroom tonight here in New York City. 
[00:20:30]  We're all going.  A few tickets still available if you want to go with us, okay?  Oh, yes, of course.  Uncle Willie's tickles today on the O&A Show.  Here with everyone else who's talking about, O&A Uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:21:00]  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's a virus, the O&A virus.  Basically, it works like this.  You like what you hear, and you tell a friend, and then they get hooked on the show.  And then we get big ratings.  That's how it works.  Big ratings.  And you get entertainment like you never, ever thought possible.  Ah.  Oh.  Ah.  Daily basis.  I want to know why Jimmy doesn't like romantic comedies.  Because they're neither. 
[00:21:30]  They're not romantic, and they're not funny.  I hate romantic comedies.  They're chick flicks.  They're terrible.  They're chick flicks.  No, chick flicks are chick flicks.  But usually, a chick flick is some type of romantic comedy.  Unless it's one of those, you know, tragedy things.  You know what I like?  It's never action-packed.  This is a good year with Russell.  I'm obsessed with how awful this movie looks.  Russell Crowe trying to change his image or something.  He's having a bad run. 
[00:22:00]  He makes a great movie, Cinderella Man, and no one sees it.  No one.  And the reviews on that movie were unbelievable.  And now he's got this, uh, just, uh, this bomb.  Well, it's like he plays this, like, this British stock guy or whatever who's like this rich scumbag type guy.  Yeah.  As a character I could probably enjoy.  And then he inherits a mansion and then he falls in love with a girl in the town and just dreck.  It's dreck.  And he turns.  He realizes the important thing.  Yeah, I'm sure he does.  I'm sure. 
[00:22:30]  I'm certain of it.  And the reality was he'd, like, redo the mansion, try to stay there once a week, bang her, and go back to London and keep banging whoever he was and raping the stockholders.  A good year.  It just looks enragedly bad.  What happened to him with two swords decapitating someone in an arena?  Now, that was a movie.  Gladiator.  And that would be a great romantic comedy.  Right.  She says, I'm pregnant, and he yanks out a sword and decapitates her. 
[00:23:00]  There's, like, good fun music the whole movie, and they're having sex, and he's falling in love.  And as soon as she says the P word, a sword comes out and kicks her head into the empty pool.  Lossips her head off.  There's some Peter Gabriel song playing in the background.  Climbing up.  I said, all right, shut up.  And he says, I forgot to tell you, I hate babies.  He yells at her decapitated head.  And then the romantic music plays.  Yeah.  The whole Coliseum laughs, and a few people kiss.  Romance, comedy, you got it all.  Well, the paper's giving it one and a half stars. 
[00:23:30]  It's not doing well.  Stranger Than Fiction, Will Ferrell's movie.  Yeah.  It looks like he's got a hit on his hands.  Three, four stars.  But a lot of people saying he remade The Truman Show.  Oh, is that what it is?  They're saying it's a lot like that.  But it's getting rave reviews.  But Borat's going to be the movie to beat this weekend.  Yeah.  Because they're adding it onto a billion screens, I think.  A billion screens.  I believe it's a billion screens.  They're already saying it's going to make another 30 million this weekend.  30 quadrillion.  Even though it's been out a while. 
[00:24:00]  Well, Queen Latifah's in the other one, and she's always.  Well, don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  She plays the big, sassy, doesn't take any guff black woman.  I haven't seen her part, but I'm imagining.  Let's hope it's that.  Yeah.  Let's hope it's that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you think you're going to get away with that?  Oh, and then the white guy will do this.  Oh, and then the white guy will do this.  I'll tell you where we're going, honey.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  Where Steve Martin can make another goofy face.  The everyman poster.  That smug, dumb look on his face in every poster.  Hands on the hips.  Mm-hmm.  Here's the face he makes.  Mm-hmm.  But it's radio, Jimmy, so.  Everyone knows that face.  Oh, everyone knows.  Your eyes are squinting.  You picture the Steve Martin cheaper by the dozen face.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yuck.  A lot of people thought that movie was terrific, Jimmy.  Oh, my God. 
[00:25:00]  I'm sure they did.  I think that was a.  Smith's family.  I think that was a romantic comedy.  Of course it was.  Yeah?  I don't know, actually.  I don't know.  Didn't say it.  Was there one romantic comedy out there that guys liked?  Pretty Woman.  Hmm.  Pretty Woman.  That was a good movie.  Oh.  It wasn't a bad movie, though.  Stop it.  I liked it.  Anything.  Plus, he was the white knight.  He came and rescued her.  Richard Gere.  He has that big thing on his back we all saw in an officer and a gentleman.  That giant birthmark.  Does anyone not remember that giant birthmark?  I don't remember that one. 
[00:25:30]  It's like a Port Weinstein, eight feet by eight feet.  It's like a throw rug on his back.  You ever watch Pretty Woman and just imagine all the things?  That gerbil blood.  You ever watch Pretty Woman and imagine all the things Julia Roberts had to do before  Richard Gere saved her?  Absolutely.  All the just horrific things she had to do?  All the Jason Alexander's.  That's what a hooker is really like.  All the businessmen in their bunny suit.  Yeah.  All the plushies.  Great party.  Oh, by the way, I know a girl who did dominatrix work who will come on the air and talk about 
[00:26:00]  plushies that she's had.  Oh, nice.  Plushies, guys that like stuffed animals.  Oh, yeah, she's a real dom and she would make him go out to eat in his plushies outfit  just to humiliate him.  Yeah.  He would wear a plushie outfit.  Yeah, she's for real.  Like a bunny?  Yeah, I don't remember the outfit.  Or was it a gopher?  A koala bear?  I don't remember.  She told me that if I blocked it out with laughter.  That's a romantic comedy.  When you wind up putting on a rabbit outfit, then you can't sit for two weeks due to injuries  sustained during the session. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, moving backwards to the Borat movie, for the people that saw it already, there's a  scene.  I'm not going to give away the scene, really, but basically he does a scene with some frat  guys that get really drunk.  Yep.  Frat guys are now suing.  They're suing.  Faggots.  Because they felt like they looked really stupid.  So they were too drunk to be signing releases.  And they were pretty much told, well, they were drinking before the scene to loosen them 
[00:27:00]  up and stuff.  Yeah.  And then, I guess, the producers and directors and all that talked them into signing the  releases when they were completely hammered.  Was that it?  Well, you could tell these guys are complete tools no matter if they're drunk or sober in  the movie.  And, you know, the drunkard they got, they got, I'll give you this much, they started  getting really racist and stuff.  Yeah.  But they signed releases, but they were told that, excuse me, this documentary would never  be seen in America.  That it was a documentary that was going to be seen in another country.  Told by who?  Huh?  Yeah, but wasn't that part of the gag? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, I guess.  I would assume they would tell the people after the fact that, no, this isn't a documentary  for Kazakhstan.  It's a movie that's going to be in America.  Releases signed?  Screw you.  Yeah, but if you saw the movie, those frat kids going cross country, they are suing.  Now, if the movie flopped, do you think they'd sue?  What douchebags?  I don't think they'd be suing if the movie was a flop.  They just want a payday.  I think they'd see a lot of money here and go, ah, cash in.  They want a payday.  Yeah.  They're embarrassed. 
[00:28:00]  I don't even know if they're embarrassed.  I think they're just looking for a payday.  Two frat boys who appear in Borat filed suit in Los Angeles yesterday, claiming the producers  liquored them up and duped them into signing release forms.  In the film, Borat played, we all know that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  As they drink, they're crazier and their conversation turns racist and anti-Semitic.  The suit filed anonymously, says the filmmakers contacted the fraternity and told the young  men they were making a documentary that would not be seen in the United States.  I don't remember being in a fraternity. 
[00:28:30]  Before filming, the frat boys were taken to a bar to loosen up.  Ah.  They claim it was only after getting drunk that they signed a release.  Why are they suing anonymously?  How can you do that?  Obviously, a lawyer probably said, hey, you know, looked into it and said, all right,  well, I can make some money off these guys.  Yeah.  I'll talk them into suing.  That's what I'm thinking.  They now suffer humiliation, emotional distress, and loss of reputation.  But their hazing didn't give them that.  Yeah, exactly.  What did they have to do? 
[00:29:00]  I want to know exactly what they had to do to get into that fraternity they're in.  Well, we just had that hazing story the other day with the guy in the pink panties.  Yeah.  Crying, lying on the floor, vomiting on himself in a skirt and fairy wings.  That's more humiliating than being in a hugely popular movie.  Make them take the stand.  Yeah, and tell them what they had to do to get into the fraternity.  Tell that jury what you had to do to get into that fraternity and then see how embarrassed you are. 
[00:29:30]  Well, judge, I had to do the elephant walk.  Naked.  I did the pickle exchange.  And we had to wear tiaras.  And then we got hit with a wooden paddle on the buttocks in our underpants.  And I lost all of my faculties.  Now my pledge name is Ol' Gravy Leg.  Well, judge, I had to play bomb the DK house and we used marshmallows to bomb the DK house. 
[00:30:00]  I was humiliated.  Yeah.  How humiliated could they be?  I had to pick up the marshmallows without using my hands.  Get it, judge?  Yeah.  I had to do the demonstration.  You make a great point.  Stop.  That's the defense right there.  Yeah.  Just asking what they did to get into the fraternity.  So humiliated.  All right, eventually we're going to figure out what this silly thing is.  Let me play it again for everybody.  What?  Mmm.  Mmm. 
[00:30:30]  All right, we'll go to the phones in a minute or two and try to figure out what that is. 
[00:31:00]  On the end of the feedback, we got Conquered Nation.  I know, by the way, I know what that is.  Yeah, what is it, Jimmy?  It's the sounds of laughter.  Coming from the new Russell Crowe film theater. 
[00:31:30]  Someone from Cleveland, I believe when you refer to plushies, there's a difference.  People who dress up as animals are furries, and plushies are into stuffed animals.  Furries?  These people all fall under the umbrella of douche.  Right.  Why douche?  I think plushies, yeah, like stuffed animals.  Right, right.  And then there are whatever they are that like to dress up like stuffed animals.  Yeah.  And what are they, furries?  That's what this person is saying. 
[00:32:00]  All right, we got the...  All perverts, if you ask me.  Viacom dip 15, 16%.  Nice.  Oops.  That's what you get.  Sorry, I'm just very happy.  For what?  I don't know, I just saw it.  Why are you happy?  We're kind of connected to that.  And it's still affiliated with them.  No, no.  Even though CBS was spun off as its own radio division, it still falls underneath the Viacom  financial umbrella, which doesn't necessarily mean they have an influence of... 
[00:32:30]  I just want to make sure the big bosses know that Jim Norton is very happy that the company  is failing this quarter.  No, no, no, no, no, I'm happy it didn't dip 25%.  Ah, okay.  Now, see, I know Jimmy's always looking for that angle to trip us up.  We thought he didn't like the company.  No, no, no, no, thank God it wasn't more.  And then we saw, and it was like, oh, thank God it isn't more, turns it around.  His face turned into an old school cartoon where you see the redness in his face go, 
[00:33:00]  and just drain out of his face.  He went white.  I just saw his head turn into the cartoon jackass.  You want to talk about cartoons?  That was a good one.  They turned into a big lollipop sucker on it.  Yeah.  Had to be subtle for the kids.  Let's say hi to Jay in Connecticut.  Jay, what's going on?  Hi, Jay.  Hey, I know the sound.  Yeah?  The Japanese national basketball team talking smack. 
[00:33:30]  Talking smack?  Close.  Oh, there is a whistle in there.  That's what I thought.  Hey, bring back Tippi Tom for your homeless shopping spree.  Yeah, homeless shopping.  The homeless shopping spree coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Did we announce a date?  Tentatively speaking.  All right.  Yeah, for the new listeners, you're going to love this one.  We bring homeless people to a really, really nice mall, and we let them treat themselves  to whatever they want.  Treat themselves. 
[00:34:00]  We got to find Andrew and bring him.  Yeah.  By the way.  Then break his gifts.  Huh?  Then break his gifts.  Dude, I don't know if he's ever coming back.  We got to find Andrew.  I think that cake put him over the edge.  You think?  Yeah, where he won't come back to that spot anymore.  Well, the homeless cake stomping, which is on YouTube, that's Andrew, and we want to  find him for the homeless shopping spree that we're going to be doing.  I think he saw that as very disrespectful, degrading, and he doesn't want to be partied  to that anymore.  Accurately.  He saw it accurately.  Yeah, he saw it completely accurately. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Another instant feedback coming in from Timothy from Virginia.  Tim, I'll.  Guys, I love your show, and I've been a fan for a long time.  What?  However.  Exactly.  Why do you feel it's necessary to make fun of everyone that has a problem?  He raises a good point.  If someone called saying they're dying of a disease, you guys would be the first to  bring him down.  Well, who would we do that to today?  And because it's funny, to answer your question.  Yeah, what happened?  All right.  That's an accurate description of the show. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Why did you all?  We didn't do it today.  Not yet.  We made fun of one good year.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, Ridley Scott film.  He can handle it.  He did Alien.  That's a Ridley Scott movie?  Yes.  What a waste.  I don't know.  What a waste of a director.  Why?  I don't know.  It'd be a lot of laughs, him and Russell.  You're going to be boyish and charming.  You know, it's what you wanted.  I hate the coming attraction where he's in the pool, scooping out something.  He does that pratfall.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  Oh, he does.  It's the deuce chill. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah?  And she's like, what are you doing?  And he says something witty.  Oh, diving or whatever stupid remark.  If anybody knows that trailer, it's the worst thing you've ever seen.  He's in an empty pool, shoveling mud, and he falls down and make a boom.  And she says something, like looks in and says something.  He was in Beautiful Mind, right?  Yes, he was great in that, too.  Great in that.  Fantastic in that.  The Insider.  Great in that movie.  Another one great in that.  What the hell happened?  He's a great actor.  What did he do, though?  He threw a phone.  He threw a phone at me.  He threw a phone at some dope behind a hotel desk. 
[00:36:00]  He's done.  And now he all of a sudden has bad scriptitis.  No, he's trying to remake his image to be funny and charming.  Oh, is that what you think this is?  Wow, that makes perfect sense, though.  Like, all right, we're going to have to get you a movie where you're charming, funny, romantic,  funny.  And that'll clear things up.  People will love you.  Then he could go back to, like, action or, you know, take some morally challenging roles. 
[00:36:30]  He should chop his agent's head off with two swords.  All right, here we go.  Cancer.  Cigarettes.  Jesus.  Oh.  Losing of the lungs.  Voice boxes.  Ed Bradley.  Oh, wow.  Hey, hey, hey, that was leukemia.  And who knew, man?  No.  No one, apparently.  I was at an XM event.  Mike Wallace didn't know.  I was at an XM event.  He didn't know?  I heard an interview with Mike Wallace yesterday on Fox News, and they're talking about the guy 
[00:37:00]  was healthy as a horse.  Every day during, like, lunchtime, he would leave and go to the gym and work out.  And the guy was the picture of health.  That's all he knew.  I guess he didn't tell anybody.  I saw him at an XM event less than a year ago.  I know.  He was what?  Were you there?  I got a picture with him.  Was it the Oprah thing?  You got a picture with him?  Ed Bradley.  Oh, that's right.  You did.  Really?  Yeah.  Did he sign it?  No.  Did he get him to sign it?  Oh, wow.  That would have been a good one. 
[00:37:30]  That was a good one.  Now.  But Mike Wallace is saying he didn't know?  No.  No.  He kept it from everybody, I guess.  What happened?  Like, leukemia.  On vacation?  Leukemia, 65 years old.  Unbelievable.  Eek.  And you know he was probably getting the best care.  He's Ed Bradley.  So he probably had...  If you're Ed Bradley and you can't, like, beat it, we're all finished.  Yeah.  Best of care.  I didn't like that dumb earring, but I liked him.  He was a good reporter, man. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Asked the doctor how long he had and what'd the doctor say.  60 minutes.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Huh.  I know I was going to say...  I don't get tased.  Yes, you do.  I pray.  Why would you tase me after I'm in an accident?  Ed Bradley was really good.  He was still alive.  Yes, he was.  All right.  Here we go.  There were two very disturbing commercials on TV recently.  You know, they always...  They had the cigarette commercials all the time. 
[00:38:30]  Our favorite was the guy with the voice box that used to like to go swimming.  Oh, remember him?  What happened to him?  He used to swab his throat hole out with the...  They would show him in his bathroom, yeah, swabbing out the hole that he had to talk out.  Covered with a rag.  That was pretty effective.  You know which ones do not work?  Those stupid, too cool for the room, non-smoking young people hanging up the signs.  Did you know that cigarette smoke has acetone in it and acetone was outlawed by the... 
[00:39:00]  And people look around like, who gives a flying F what this idiot is saying?  And they hold up the big sign with the big website address to go to?  Or, what are you doing?  We're delivering the same amount of body bags from people that die every year from cigarette smoking.  Are you? 
[00:39:30]  And then they kind of blur out people's faces, even though everyone's an actor, and it's all fake, and all staged, and all phony.  Those are the truth?  Did he say it?  Yeah, thetruth.com.  Which, by the way, is sponsored, I think, by Philip Morris and the other cigarette companies.  They had to kick up some money in that settlement for anti-smoking ads.  And you actually see the name, I think, Philip Morris in the ad, which is something they hadn't been able to do for years when they were not able to advertise. 
[00:40:00]  So it kind of works both ways.  I don't understand.  I mean, who doesn't know that cigarettes are bad for you at this point?  Yeah, that's what it is.  You know, cigarettes contain carcinogens and can make babies have low birth weight.  Like, who doesn't know all this stuff?  Who the hell?  What?  Apparently, Asians in casinos have no clue because they are smoking constantly.  I want to take those little yellow-stained, bony fingers and poke their own eyes out with them. 
[00:40:30]  When you're sitting at a table and they are non-stop smoking their American cigarettes, they won't stop.  Maybe they don't understand.  Maybe those ads ought to be in Japanese.  I think we have one of those ads.  Oh, yeah, we do.  What?  I think we have one of those Japanese anti-smoking ads.  Oh, yeah?  That's what happens if you smoke and you're Asian.  Say, very dangerous. 
[00:41:00]  Say, very dangerous.  Well, we're trying to figure out what that is. 
[00:41:30]  Who cares what it is?  It's really funny.  How does anyone understand that?  That can't possibly be a language.  Who knows?  All right.  We'll find out what that's all about.  We'll play the Cancer Box song next.  We'll talk about cigarettes a little bit.  We got Tyra as a homeless person.  We got, I think today, we finally do some more news teases. 
[00:42:00]  One of our favorite, favorite things to do on the Opie and Anthony show.  You mean one of those voice box thingies?  Huh?  The way you said it, I thought you meant Christopher Reeve's wife.  Sorry.  What?  I'll listen to the replay.  No, you didn't get it?  No, I didn't either.  It was too far away from it.  I waited.  When both of us don't get it, then there's got to be a problem. 
[00:42:30]  What did you advertise?  Wait, someone got it?  What did you advertise it as?  News teases.  Coming up.  Coming up.  News teases.  No.  The other thing with the smoking.  Oh.  Cancer box song.  Yeah, all right.  But you said after I said also coming up one of our favorite things to do, news teases.  Yeah, but I said, oh, the cancer kazoo thing.  Oh, my God.  I thought you were talking about Christopher Reeve's wife.  I won't take the taser.  I'm fighting it.  I'm fighting it.  No. 
[00:43:00]  No, I'm fighting it.  I'm fighting.  No, I'm hitting.  No.  I'm fighting.  I'm standing.  I'm trying to stand up for this one.  You're not keeping me down.  Did we just do hack radio?  Yes.  I hope that hurt you.  It really did hurt.  That was just mean.  I just slapped myself for doing hack radio.  Wow, that really effing hurt. 
[00:43:30]  All right, we got lots to do.  Yes.  Why don't we do something?  We just teased 10 things.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  And I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving. 
[00:44:00]  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to everybody!  Except you.  Yeah, you.  You know who you are.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  You know who you are.  I don't say good morning to you! 
[00:44:30]  Cancer commercials, Anthony.  We got two to play today.  Well, the cancer box song is just terrific.  And that's a commercial?  Yeah, yeah.  But first we got a commercial that they were running for the election that just passed us by.  Some kind of bill.  I think.  I don't know.  Let's take a listen and see what this is about.  Figure it out.  I smoked my first cigarette at the age of 14. 
[00:45:00]  At the age of 48, I got throat cancer.  If you don't want this to happen to your child or someone you love, please vote yes on Amendment 3.  Amendment 3 creates youth anti-smoking programs and helps smokers quit.  When you step into that voting booth on Tuesday, think of your kids.  Remember my voice.  Vote yes on Amendment 3.  Thank God the government is there to take care of us.  Because we can't take care of ourselves.  Can't figure out that smoking's bad for you. 
[00:45:30]  So the amendment is what?  Oh, Jimmy doesn't agree.  No, no, I don't know.  I'm up in the air on this one.  Why?  I don't know what the whole thing is, though.  It sounds like, hey, it protects the kids.  But what is it, really?  That type of crap annoys you.  Although the smoking industry in this one, they for so long lied about what was in their thing,  purposefully being deceitful.  Like, it's not like they were being honest all along.  Yeah, I get all that.  But it's not what I like to call the good old thing.  I was going to say, yeah, it's not the 50s anymore.  It's 2006.  I'm amazed there are people out there that don't know smoking is really bad for you. 
[00:46:00]  Menthol's good for your throat.  It's pretty much what they were saying back then about cigarettes.  Filter?  Who needs them?  Hey, just smoke your Lucky or your Chesterfield.  They would say, like, you know, nine of ten doctors recommend Chesterfield.  It's got a smooth draw.  These cool words for it.  Smooth draw.  Silky feeling on your throat. 
[00:46:30]  Like, it actually helped your throat.  And helps combat lung fever.  Weren't the Lucky Strike ones the best?  Lucky's ruled.  Let me see.  This is an old school Lucky Strike commercial.  Look, you're already winning with the music.  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men. 
[00:47:00]  Disjointed.  LSMFT.  LSMFT.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Ew.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  So round.  So firm.  Oh.  So fully packed. 
[00:47:30]  So free and easy on the draw.  On the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco.  Lucky Strike.  And remember, cigarette paper is white.  Even the paper that is rolled around that fine tobacco is white.  Just like your neighborhood if you smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes. 
[00:48:00]  Lucky Strike.  The favorite cigarette of white people.  If you want a whites only cigarette, smoke Lucky's.  Not like those mentholated Negro cigarettes.  So pick up a Lucky and help win the war against Hitler and the Japs and the Negroes.  Smoke a Lucky.  Easy on the draw.  Easy on the throat.  Recommended by every doctor. 
[00:48:30]  Cancer, what's that?  Never heard of it.  Smoking Lucky gets rid of tumors.  We don't even know what tumors are.  But it gets rid of them.  You'll find out in the future.  When there are no more Negroes.  The good old days.  We're trying to find the good cigarette ads.  Where the doctors endorse smoking and all that.  Of course they lied.  We got them.  I just...  There was a point, though, where I don't think they knew. 
[00:49:00]  Look at medical technology back then.  They're a bunch of dopes.  What did they know?  Sucking smoke into your lungs?  Harmful?  Stop it.  Stop it, please.  We were stupid.  We didn't know anything.  If man exceeds 30 miles per hour for any length of time, he will surely perish.  Nine.  One of my favorites, when the train came out, people couldn't do 30 miles an hour for any  length of time where they will surely perish. 
[00:49:30]  That's what they said.  Really?  That's what some dope said.  Yeah.  Ew.  30.  Hey, I think I found the cigarette ad where the doctors endorse smoking.  Ah, let's talk to a doctor.  According to a recent nationwide survey, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette.  Three leading independent research organizations asked this question of 113,597 doctors.  Wow.  That's even number.  What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?  The brand name most was Camel.  Now, you probably enjoy rich, full flavor and cool mildness in a cigarette just as much 
[00:50:00]  as doctors do.  That's why, if you're not a Camel smoker now, try a Camel on your T-Zone.  That's T for taste and T for throat.  Your true proving ground for any cigarette.  See if Camel's rich flavor of superbly blended choice tobaccos isn't extra delightful to your  taste.  See if Camel's cool mildness isn't in harmony with your throat.  See if you, too, don't say Camel's suit my T-Zone to a T. 
[00:50:30]  And then the doctor tells you about the C-Zone you have in your lungs and all over your neck.  Isn't that amazing, though?  Doctors.  They actually got doctors to endorse.  That long ago, they knew there was a problem, though.  The fact that they would have doctors endorsing it that long ago, they knew.  You're like, why would you go to doctors?  They knew.  Like, why would you go to doctors out of all the people?  Why not, you know, have these construction workers love Lucky?  Like, doctors, look, we know this stuff really screws you up, but look, doctors smoke. 
[00:51:00]  Well, no, it happened.  If you know anything about marketing, the word was getting around.  Yeah.  And the cigarette industry needed a big one to help them out.  So they probably did a little payola, plugola with the doctors saying, look, hey, you want  a brand new sports car?  Say something good.  Say something good.  We can't let the word out that people's lungs are turning into Swiss cheese.  Let's go to Bruce.  Would you please give us a little endorsement?  Yeah, let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Bruce.  Yeah, hey, they talk about protecting the children with these ads. 
[00:51:30]  What about when the Flintstones were hawking cigarettes?  Yeah, we played that one.  That's part of it, yeah.  It's Winston.  It's also, these guys, they have to sign these non-disclosure acts.  You can't talk about anything that you learn in the tobacco.  They're just scumbags.  I mean, they've really dug their own financial grave as far as I'm concerned.  They've been complete scum with the public.  But they're still doing very well.  Absolutely.  And I think it's more worldwide, too, because they don't have to adhere to all those rules. 
[00:52:00]  And people around the world love the American cigarettes.  They're being smashed in the U.S. good, though.  Here's the Flintstones ad.  Oh, smoking's coming back with the kids.  It's coming back with the kids.  Oh, good.  Good to see.  They sure work hard, don't they, Monty?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back when we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap? 
[00:52:30]  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Bonnie, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute. 
[00:53:00]  The Flintstones has been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Cigarette chute.  How crazy is that?  Yada-da-da.  Yada-da-da.  Smoke a Winston.  And he's smoking. 
[00:53:30]  Get the cancer.  And even back then, Honus Wagner's card is so valuable, that baseball card, because he  had it yanked, because he didn't want to put in cigarette packs because he didn't want  kids smoking.  That's why the Honus Wagner card is so rare.  That's the reason?  Really?  No clue.  He did not want kids buying cigarettes to get his card.  And that's why that card is so phenomenally rare.  So even back in 1911 or whatever that was.  They just knew.  Yeah, they knew.  Well, now the cigarette ads are a lot different.  Here's the latest one.  And finally, we get to the Cancer Box song. 
[00:54:00]  Listen to this.  You don't always die from tobacco.  Sometimes you just lose a love.  Oh, you don't always die from tobacco.  Sometimes they just sniff out your tongue.  And you won't sing what the heck with a big hole in your neck.  Don't you don't always die from tobacco. 
[00:54:30]  I like it.  Don't always die from tobacco.  Yeah, so you might not be dead, but you'll be talking through one of those.  That, to me, was scary.  That scared me into quitting smoking.  You can't scare a smoker or a drinker into quitting.  That was what got me.  It was the idea of having a piece of my jaw taken out or drooling into a bag.  It wasn't death.  Death is like this intangible thing that none of us can.  Yeah, all right.  When you're dead, you're dead.  But that was like, man, to have to live with a piece of your tongue on or a piece of your jaw cut out. 
[00:55:00]  That really freaked me out.  There you go.  I'm thinking that maybe the listeners could come up with their own cigarette ads.  It's a good song.  What do you think?  You like that one?  Yeah, I like the voice, but the song was good.  We could give it a try.  Have the listeners come up with their own cigarette ads.  I was trying to see what they died of.  What?  The guys that did the Flintstones.  The voices.  Hopefully they were shot for making an unfunny cartoon.  I hated the Flintstones. 
[00:55:30]  You didn't like the Flintstones, did you?  No, I hated the Flintstones.  Why?  Hey, Bonnie.  Shut up.  Why shut up?  It was one of the greatest cartoons ever, Jimmy.  It never made me laugh once.  Based on, you know, the honeymooners.  I know, I know.  It just took a little toodaloo noise that they would make.  That's when they were walking on their tippy toes.  I hated it.  I liked the...  Mel Blanc was heart disease.  Buck Bunny was great.  I just didn't like the Flintstones.  That's too bad.  I know.  Big dumb dinosaur.  Let's say hi to Dan in Youngstown. 
[00:56:00]  Dan, what's up?  There it is.  We have that noise ready.  That's Fred Bowling.  Hello?  Yeah, Dan, what's up?  Yes, sir.  Hey, long time listener.  Appreciate you guys.  Long time.  I want to see you in the morning.  I wanted to give a response to that Chinese ad that you had.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the Japanese...  It's Japanese.  We know that much.  All right.  Well, it must be...  Dude, the bottom line is this.  The smoking commercials, they've just brought it on themselves. 
[00:56:30]  I have no mercy for them.  All right.  I just don't...  I don't.  I have no mercy.  Even though it's a legal product and you should be able to advertise, I have no mercy for them.  Yeah, but didn't you think, like, Wilma and Betty were hot?  No.  Devils.  They're a cartoon character.  Betty was better than Wilma.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, Wilma was more of the house-wise thing.  Betty had a little wild streak in her.  Stop.  And her womb was barren.  They had to adopt Bam Bam.  I saw Betty's Craigslist there.  It said she speaks Greek.  There you go. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  I was ready to yell, hack radio alert, but Jimmy helped us out.  Yeah.  You know, many DJs have done that bit.  Who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  Well, take your calls now.  Who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  I think Wilma.  What do you think, Anthony?  Velma.  Velma?  Velma from Scooby-Doo.  Why Velma?  Because she seems like she would work harder.  Yeah.  Jimmy, who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick? 
[00:57:30]  Dora the Explorer.  Saving us from hack radio again.  Jim Norton.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, I wanted to say, I think that's MTV Japan's version of Yo Mama.  Ooh, that's your guess?  We're playing Guess the Sound on the Opie and Anthony show today.  He thinks this is the Japanese version of Yo Mama.  Gochus goi wa!  Gochus goi wa!  Gochus goi!  Just wait!  Okay, the next title is this!  No, no, I'm sorry. 
[00:58:00]  It is not that.  We'll continue getting guesses.  Yes, Dan in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  Welcome aboard, Dan.  All right.  My grandmother, when we were cleaning out of our apartment, had an advertisement with John Wayne on it. 
[00:58:30]  And it said, exercise your lungs, advertising some cigarette.  It just seemed ridiculous.  Exercise your lungs?  He certainly did.  His lungs got a workout when they were like, one, two, three, four, pull it out.  Pull it out.  And I heard he had 40 pounds of food in his colon.  Someone said that, because back then, you know.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard it was so impacted and stuff.  It was just bad eating.  All he did was have big steaks. 
[00:59:00]  Of course.  Just drank gravy and smoked cigarettes.  Down at the Brown Derby.  Oh, the Duke lived it up.  Yeah, of course he did.  If you ask the Duke, if you wanted to die at soda, he'd spit in your face.  Yes.  Well, every movie you see, he was a real man.  Yeah, well.  He didn't die from the lung cancer, though, did he?  I think he died from cancer.  Yeah, but they're saying he died because they were making one of those westerns.  In the area where they were testing nuclear weaponry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nuclear explosion.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that must have been my idea. 
[00:59:30]  Nuclear testing.  I mean, maybe we can find the story.  They're saying a ton of people from this one particular movie died of cancer.  Yeah.  And they're looking at the whole fact that they were filming this movie in the desert where they were doing some...  Atomic bomb testing.  Atomic bomb testing.  A young hawk already brought something up that said John Wayne died of stomach cancer on June 11, 1979.  Yes, that is.  Hey, Dan, can you give us that commercial?  We'd love to play it.  I don't know where it is in the... 
[01:00:00]  Dan!  Now I'm listening to myself.  Dan!  No, I was just on the radio.  You're like four minutes ahead of schedule.  Let's listen to this dummy.  Listen to himself.  Look at this idiot.  How stupid can you...  What a complete ass.  He just hung up.  What an idiot.  I was just on the radio.  Now I'm going to listen to myself.  Oh, it's a four minute to...  Shut up.  I hope you're still listening.  You're a douche.  That's right.  Great home.  Where should you pay them?  Pay them.  Pay them. 
[01:00:30]  Pay them.  Let us out of the blue.  What the hell was that?  We've got to get the uncensored version for XM.  It's a chick getting tasered while singing Sweet Home Alabama.  Sweet Home Alabama.  Where should you pay them?  Pay them.  Pay them.  Pay them.  Make a better child of the blue.  Sweet Home Alabama.  Why did they taser her?  I mean, she did suck. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  Actually, it's on break.com.  It's hilarious.  I was watching that this morning.  Sam and I are on the same page today.  And then it's a montage of people getting tased.  Someone says, Genghis Khan was the movie.  Everyone involved died of cancer, including Agnes Moorhead from Bewitched.  Agnes Moorhead.  She died.  That wasn't a movie, was it?  Genghis Khan?  I thought it was a Western. 
[01:01:30]  And, of course, someone says, Genghis Khan got glowing reviews.  Very funny nuclear radiation joke.  Agnes Moorhead was her name?  Agnes Moorhead.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take...  Certainly beats going out with, Agnes, my neck hurts.  You want to start news teasers or you want to take a break?  Agnes, I'm tired.  Agnes, I don't know you well enough.  Because then she becomes Agnes Black Eye, where Agnes walks home.  Agnes, it smells like onions. 
[01:02:00]  Agnes, I'd rather...  That is an awful name to have to go through life with.  It certainly is.  You want to start with news teasers?  We'll do a couple, then we'll break.  Yes, I love...  We might as well just jump into it as we say.  Why even dip in the water?  Right.  And why don't you explain the scary news teasers for everybody?  Oh, you've seen them.  You've seen them all over in your cities, wherever you are.  It's your local news. 
[01:02:30]  And you're watching a show, maybe Seinfeld's on, maybe you're watching Everyone Loves Raymond.  You're watching one of those shows.  And then, in the middle of a commercial break, your local news people break in and scare the crap out of you by telling you that perhaps your children are in danger by a toy they're playing with, but they don't tell you what it is.  Because they want you to tune in when the news comes on.  And, you know, we're looking for news teasers that make the News Tease Hall of Fame. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, the real bad ones.  The ones that are so blatantly dishonest and just there to sensationalize something and get you to tune in to their program.  That's right.  No fact.  We only have four in the News Tease Hall of Fame so far.  And we've listened to hundreds.  And we're looking for you guys to, you know, send in your favorite scary news teasers to Danny, right?  Danny?  Yes.  Your email address is Danny at FoundryMusic.com.  That is correct.  And is that email address up on OpieAndAnthony.com for people to submit stuff into the show? 
[01:03:30]  I believe so.  Are you starting to get more news teases from around America?  Not in a while.  They were coming in at a pretty decent pace, but they slowed down, so they better get on it.  Because we haven't done the bit in a while.  No.  All right.  Well, here's the four that made the Hall of Fame, Anthony.  You got this one.  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11 on News 8.  Hmm.  Are you...  What the...  And then you have this one. 
[01:04:00]  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  All right.  I...  You know, since that one, anytime me or my girlfriend hiccup...  Yeah.  ...around the house, we'd point and just go, cancer.  That one really stuck with us.  Really?  It's like, cancer.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  Now, if that isn't sensationalizing, it's a common thing.  Everyone gets hiccups at some point.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:04:30]  And they don't explain in that tease anything.  Well, the next one's even better.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Could shut down religion.  Yeah.  Definitely worthy of its spot.  We've had predators and we've had religion since the beginning of time, for the most part.  It's going to shut it down.  But now it's going to shut it down.  How do you shut down religion?  Yeah, no...  Like, on the whole...  You can't pray at all?  You can't go to a house of worship?  No.  Because there's a pedophile who wants to do something that you have to let him do? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Because there's a little diddling going on?  You can't even be in front of a shrine in your house, which is considered religion,  like in a room somewhere.  All religion.  Shut down forever.  Yeah.  Everywhere.  I shut down.  And finally, still my favorite of all time.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  How about just saying a three-block area in...  And then say the city. 
[01:05:30]  There you go.  All right.  We're going to play the latest news teases after the break.  And also, we're still trying to figure out what that Japanese thing is.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing  in a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Absolutely. 
[01:06:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Very busy day.  Jeff Daniels has arrived.  Guitar in hand.  He's getting some coffee as we speak to wake up a little bit.  He'll be on the show in a few minutes.  Frank Caliendo calling in.  Bob Saget calling in.  And later on this morning, Tom Papa in studio.  A very funny guy that flies around America in a jet to open up for Jerry Seinfeld.  Right?  Is that basically it with Tom?  Yeah.  He does all kinds of corporate events.  He's friends with Clint Eastwood.  It makes me sick.  Yeah.  Not a bad gig whatsoever.  We're in the middle of doing news teases. 
[01:06:30]  One of our favorite bits on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're looking for your scary news teases from your local news.  Go to opieandanthony.com.  There's a link there where you can send in all your stuff for the radio show.  Okay?  Right.  Well, let's get right into this.  Scary news teases.  The latest batch.  Here's the first one.  Plus, coffee, cell phones, fries.  Well, now a new danger on the road.  And it's right in a driver's palm.  Ah, well, I've heard about things like that. 
[01:07:00]  You shouldn't do it while you're driving.  It is dangerous.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Didn't that joke end with, well, you should see what's in her hand.  Plus, coffee, cell phones, fries.  Well, now a new danger on the road.  And it's right in a driver's palm.  Let me think.  Blackberries. 
[01:07:30]  Stigmata.  Stigmata.  Could be blood on the wheel.  A little slippery.  I'm going to say, what were the choices first?  What did they say?  Is it something?  Well, it's stuff that people already drive with.  Yeah.  But what was the first one?  Cell phone?  Coffee.  Coffee.  Plus, coffee, cell phones, fries.  The first one.  Plus, what did he say?  Well, now a new danger on the road.  And it's right in a driver's palm.  No, the first thing.  Something, then plus.  Listen.  Oh, that was the end of another story. 
[01:08:00]  Oh.  And then it goes into this scary news team.  Who left plus in there?  Plus, coffee, cell phones, fries.  Well, now a new...  What are you...  You're insane.  That makes perfect sense.  Now it tastes...  He was teasing something.  Now it does.  I thought it was four choices.  Plus, coffee.  I thought it was...  Did you guys really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's...  I thought I was misunderstanding a word, and he was mentioning another danger.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The dreaded plus.  You know how they just rattle off everything coming up. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's out with sports.  Plus...  Woo.  Instead of just saying plus the danger, he says plus, and he does the T.  He goes plus this.  The way he says it makes it sound like it's one of the list.  This is Ernie Anastis.  Ernie Anastis.  Ernie Anastis.  All right.  So what do you think it is?  So it's not the cell phones.  It's not the food.  It's not the beverages.  Makeup.  Damn it.  No.  No.  I'm going to guess.  You're carrying...  New technology.  iPod. 
[01:09:00]  What?  No.  A vial of blood from a certain...  Celebrity who used to, I don't want to say it, be a Brady.  Why not just say Robert Reed?  That would be in poor taste.  And I was trying to avoid doing another AIDS joke.  I don't want to be that predictable.  By the way, no reason to listen to the radio anymore.  No?  No.  iPods.  Taking over the world.  Yeah, we know that.  Yeah.  That's why we do a talk show.  It's in your palm.  It's not a cell phone.  It's not coffee.  It's not fries. 
[01:09:30]  Fries?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm aggravated.  Cigarettes?  It's not really a scary news tease, by the way.  It's an interesting news tease.  It's a...  A dildo.  Yeah, might as well.  Well, we've heard about the women that, you know...  Yeah, we know all about the silver bullets, ladies.  A lipstick.  All right, Danny, what is it? 
[01:10:00]  Makeup.  Well, it actually is a cell phone, because the story is about the dangers of texting and  driving.  But he said cell phone.  That's what made it so ridiculous.  Oh, God.  Texting and driving.  Well, it is kind of dangerous.  Yeah, it is.  But why not just say texting and driving dangers?  Yeah.  Instead of the palm of your hand?  Mm.  All right.  Well, let's...  Castus is a douche.  Hopefully, the next scary news tease will be better. 
[01:10:30]  It's scary.  We didn't say interesting, did we, Dan?  Right, Dan.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  He says they say they tout it as a new danger.  And meanwhile, it's not.  And it was a full danger.  It's a full danger.  See how frightened we all are after that one, Dan?  I got to shake this one off before we play the next one.  Ooh.  I'm shaking in my boots.  All right.  Here's the next one.  Coming up at 5 on Channel 4.  Is it safe to breathe and live in the city of New Orleans?  A new test has the answer. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  How about just a yes or a no?  Yeah.  Is it safe to breathe and live?  To breathe, probably.  To live, no.  Help me out here.  I'm breathing right now.  Help me out.  To breathe, probably, no.  And to live, all they ought to do is just show you the residence.  I think you can.  Let me tell you something I do know.  It's not healthy to not breathe and live anywhere.  That's really good. 
[01:11:30]  I think if you don't breathe, you have more of a chance of dying than breathing in New Orleans.  I think you might be onto something, my friend.  I try.  To breathe and live.  You're the smart one on the show.  Breathe and live.  You're the smart one around here.  Oh.  I try my best.  What am I, guys?  What am I?  I don't know, but Anthony's the smart one around here.  But what am I?  You're sweet.  No, I'm not.  You're sweet.  No, I'm not.  He's smart.  You're sweet.  What am I?  A creep.  I'm not a creep.  You're a creep.  You're a creep, too. 
[01:12:00]  So he's smart.  You're sweet and a creep.  What am I?  You're gentle with a tart underside.  A psychopath.  Hey, that's the one that, you know, flips the switch.  It's the one that boosted you to fame.  You're tough.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, Danny, is it safe to breathe air?  Yeah, I think it's pretty safe to say that it is safe to breathe.  All right.  Damn it.  Then why would they have that news tease? 
[01:12:30]  How anticlimactic is that?  Is it safe to live there?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Now on the sports.  Yes.  In other news, Pam Anderson had a miscarriage while filming Blonde and Blonder.  It wasn't Blonde and Blonder, was it?  Yeah.  That's what they were filming?  She's doing a movie, Blonde and Blonder.  Is that a Dumb and Dumber takeoff?  I don't know.  We'll have to ask Jeff Daniels.  He's here today.  But with girls.  So, she really did have a miscarriage.  Oops.  All right.  Here's the next scary news tease.  This one could be worth the price of admission. 
[01:13:00]  Keep your fingers crossed, because so far, ugh.  Yeah.  A Subway sandwich surprise.  A woman says she found a body part in her sandwich.  Should you be concerned?  Should you be concerned?  Should you be concerned?  What part was it?  Yeah, what part was it?  Where was it?  That's why we...  Do I even eat there?  Yeah.  That's why I had a day.  She'd bite into it and have mayo squirted into her mouth.  Body part found a sandwich.  Should you be concerned? 
[01:13:30]  Danny, should we?  Well, I think the finger to sandwich ratio is pretty low these days.  I don't think it would be such a problem.  Why are they asking if we should be concerned?  Because a lady had found a piece of a finger in a Subway sandwich.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  Maybe it comes in the processed meat.  Yeah, but how do you cut off your finger?  Oh, you think it...  I like the factory.  Oh, you think it falls into the big vat?  Yeah, the big vat of something.  Of Subway ingredients? 
[01:14:00]  A big hopper.  And you're too busy getting a Band-Aid or tape and you're like, ah, who's going to notice?  They like got to take Emmanuel to the hospital and the whole thing is still...  The works are still running and it's spitting out things and there goes your finger.  But Emmanuel cannot go to the hospital because he's an illegal immigrant.  But he can.  He can go to the emergency room and they can't deny you service over there.  Then you get in trouble.  That's why the emergency rooms are so full and if you've got a bullet wound, you've got 
[01:14:30]  to sit there and wait because 20 Mexicans are in there with a cold and need some aspirin.  But since they can't go to a doctor, they've got to go to the emergency room.  I saw a photo on Ogres one time of a guy whose hand had gone through a meat grinder.  I don't know how it got caught, but it went through and his arm was stuck from below the  elbow and he was just standing there and it was like a metal, like a pencil sharpener  attached and his arm was all the way through it and they had to remove his arm. 
[01:15:00]  But how do you pull your arm out of a meat grinder when it's all caught up in the bone?  It was really a mess.  Did they just cut his arm off right there?  I think they had to sever the arm or bring the machine.  Do you use leeches?  Leeches, Mike.  Why do you go to Ogres?  I don't know why you go there.  Why do you go there?  Why wouldn't you?  Did you see the picture of the guy that was trying to climb that fence with the spikes on it  and he fell and the spike went through the bottom of his jaw and came out his mouth?  Did he live?  Yeah.  And he was hanging on the fence and the cops had to come because he was trying to rob the 
[01:15:30]  place and he was hanging there by his jawbone, just stuck like a fish on a hook.  That's terrific.  Well, what do we got there, Danny?  So we have no concerns here because it doesn't happen often?  That's correct.  What are they trying to tease that there's like a serial killer working at a subway or something?  Right, just chopping off digits and throwing them into sandwiches.  I know there's another one, a news tease from another country. 
[01:16:00]  Are there Japanese news teasers?  I've heard a few of these.  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  I wonder what this story's about.  I wonder, too.  Be effects of radiation from Hiroshima?  No?  Well, why don't we listen to the scary news tease from Japan, Anthony?  Well, why don't we listen to the scary news? 
[01:16:30]  that's not a news tease Anthony that's the guess the sound thing we're doing today oh see I 
[01:17:00]  thought it was a news tease by the way no one has gotten uh guess the sound yet not one person  can figure out what that is Anthony we'll take some more uh some more guesses in a minute or two here  what dopes hey by the way how many calories in a fingertip because you know subway sandwiches  they claiming that there's not a lot of calories in their sandwiches see Jared's getting a little 
[01:17:30]  fat in a little I noticed that yeah and the commercials well it's hard to imagine that  just eating subway sandwiches doesn't isn't a great diet plan that fraud somebody isn't a  sponsor is it I wouldn't care if it was stop saying you're a great diet thing with your big  bready sandwiches you liars big bready it's all it is is bread have a big bready sandwich prepared by  somebody who barely speaks the language would you like some onions and other diarrhea inducing stuff  dumped onto this garbage no I wouldn't I mean who likes black peppers and black olives on a stupid 
[01:18:00]  sandwich oh black olives the worst no one likes black olives on a sandwich you savages  blimpy destroys subway destroys it  wow what's wrong I hate subway prefab crap it's a stupid sandwich they make their own bread right  there uh at the um do they yeah they do how lovely it's fresh baked that's wonderful but the meat's not 
[01:18:30]  fresh it just doesn't taste that way to me it's all prefab they lift those creepy lids here's the  same meat we've been serving for six weeks would you care for it yeah I always said if you're gonna  get a sandwich especially in New York you would go to a reputable deli go to blimpy they cut it  right there why go to a blimp why not go to a deli where it's made and you could say could you slice  that uh I like my ham sliced tissue paper thin yeah the guy will look at you and have no idea 
[01:19:00]  because his stupid deli is an al-qaeda front yeah maybe I'm thinking of the old days yeah of course  you are go to a blimpy all right here we go Jimmy endorsing blimpy I certainly am and I haven't  eaten one in five years but I eat subways on the road I'm tired of them sandwiches stink they seem  all right yeah eight inches of bread and those rotten meats with some savage preparing it  a prefab sandwich prepared by a savage you know at least they wear the uh plastic gloves how 
[01:19:30]  wonderful for everything that's because they're that's because they're molding c4 when they're not  making your sandwich  all right let's move on to the next scary news tease  i detest subway so far none of these are going to make the uh news tease hall of fame by the way  now we move on to the next one here it is the plan to ban an ingredient that could kill you  and why some people are saying not so fast plan to ban ingredient that can kill you there's some 
[01:20:00]  pros and cons but there's people saying not so fast we don't we don't want to ban the things that  are killing you right because it tastes good uh this could be anything i know what it is yeah anthrax  and the people say no are the anthrax makers right i saw this one the producers of anthrax the people  saying no are the ones that have stock in anthrax can you actually get their life savings oh yeah you 
[01:20:30]  can't i'm trying it's uh a and x on the nasdaq something what is that the ticker what what something  that can kill what does it i give up well you can't give up that easy i give up easy give us a hint  there dan why am i calling you dan dan dan upgraded danny give us a hint danny hmm well it's uh it's been  proposed by bloomberg for all you new yorkers so it's a new york uh ingredient wow that's arguably 
[01:21:00]  the worst hint ever given it's hard it's by anyone with any in any situation i've never heard a worse  monosodium glutamate oh uh uh uh oh hope he's got it i got it uh what i'm gonna stand for this  oh so you can all acknowledge my greatest please be wrong all right be wrong be wrong  trans fats yeah it's trans fats oh it's trans fat wait is that is that is that male fat that feels 
[01:21:30]  it's in a female fat body that's tranny fat this is an old news team that tranny trans fats  and i say not so fast if you want to eat trans fats then eat your stupid trans fats i don't give a  crap there's too many people on the road anyway smoke your cigarettes and eat your trans fats stop  trying to save everybody and maybe i'll finally find a nice freaking home in new york city get a good 
[01:22:00]  parking spot you don't need the government uh helping you out telling you now what telling you  what not to eat and telling you uh what you shouldn't smoke less government that's what i  say good i'm a libertarian by the way no you're not yeah they're kind of crazy oh yeah no i mean like  you're not in a political way i started going to meetings i'm i'm turning into a libertarian yeah 
[01:22:30]  i go to the meetings too well i know you don't you gotta dress funny socialist what  socialist never i'm a wig are you a wig yeah jimmy's part of the wig part i just like it because  it's spelled w-h-i-g i like that silent h throws everyone wig all right so it's trans fats right  yep and why do people say not so fast by the way well it's exactly the argument that you presented  where it's you know i have the right to eat it if i want to so why is someone choosing that is the  weirdest thing to me that they tell you to what's a trans fat it's it's it's it's a bad fat it's the 
[01:23:00]  ingredient that makes everything taste good why don't they just tell people if you want to eat it  eat it they're trying they're they're working with other oils and stuff but the reality is the uh  wait what well well the the trans fats are in the oils that they use to make things taste good right  yeah like you know a fast food restaurant right so they want to try to implement instead of using the  grease that they're using they want you know they want to use like vegetable oils and olive oils to  replace it instead this big fat woman was trying to make a left into a mcdonald's last night and i 
[01:23:30]  left her enough room but of course she's one of these inept broads that don't know the parameters  of her vehicle the i cannot stand people that have no clue how wide their vehicle is what spaces it could  fit through especially in manhattan where a lot of people are double parked a lot of trucks are backed in  the loading docks where they just leave enough room for you to get through on the street and people 
[01:24:00]  don't know how wide their freaking car is i could zoom through at 60 with an escalade and there's  somebody in a little toyota inching inching through trying to can i make it so i left enough room for this  slob she gives me this look like i'm blocking her like she can't wait even if i did block her  three more seconds to get her big fat face shoved into a big mac i had to yell the c-word out at her 
[01:24:30]  i had to yell you fat c-word at her and that shook her up curmudgeon yes curmudgeon wouldn't it be  more shubby wouldn't it be more effective to call her a cunt oh well it could it could  wow do i do my palms break into a sweat when you say something like that because i'm just hoping al dukes 
[01:25:00]  isn't in in the bathroom right now with his hands on his hips just going oh well i get confused  yeah so much easier instead of you know calling her the c-word wow wow oh no i got hiccups cancer  oh oh no you got the hiccup i laugh so hard cancer that's what happens you laugh so hard cancer  learn how wide your vehicle is that's what i say had a great sidewalk move too the other day 
[01:25:30]  yeah truck one of those trucks backing into the loading docks through queens when i tried to go  oh yeah expressway pain in the ass big line of cars waiting waiting waiting they just wait they just sit  there and wait right up on the sidewalk a full city block on the sidewalk and then plunk plunk back down  and i'm through and i look behind me with such pride like and i look like is anyone else going to  follow me does anyone else have the balls to follow me i wouldn't no no no all right walk 
[01:26:00]  listen we got to take a break because we got a big star he's sitting there drinking his coffee he's  bored out of his mind i'm in here what are you looking at i i was looking at the couch you thought  he was there because i pointed at the empty couch yeah i can't see behind me jeff daniels joining the  program next we got frank caliendo calling in we got bob saget calling in and we have three more  scary news teasers we're gonna do it with jeff daniels let's see what he's got yeah if he's got  some uh some chops to him of course he does and he's got a guitar i think he wants to play a song 
[01:26:30]  or two right he was in terms of endearment he was in dumb and dumber all right that's the only  virus spreading across america here with everyone else is talking about ona uncut and live continuing  the show on xm satellite radio starting at 9 a.m eastern visit xmradio.com to subscribe  it's the opian anthony show wow  all right we're back with the opian anthony show the ona virus spreading across america  very very busy day today people are trying to figure out that japanese uh audio we got scary news 
[01:27:00]  teasers we got uh hot chicks getting uh tasered and jeff daniels where do you fit into this jeff  i don't know somewhere between the hot chicks and the taser all right that's not a bad place to be  right it's a very good place to be we have not spoken to you since the uh collapse of your tigers  oh my god you were feeling very hard for them too i heard you on uh ron and fez and uh they were 
[01:27:30]  talking to you about uh it was pretty much destiny at that point it was a done deal i think they were  serious yankees fans too so i was able to fling it back their direction but um no we we you know look  at uh we weren't supposed to do anything this year and we get to the world series and as our oh that  doesn't work oh boy no but it's our closer touch we'll have to pass for profound yeah you have to 
[01:28:00]  get to the world series to lose it so that's what we're clinging to right now yeah i said some similar  stuff about my met so yeah you find a little thing that we're a young team and we got to the world  series and played young i know when i was 23 years old standing on the mound of the world series was not  you know that was not something i was prepared to do so who is it leland is the guy for them  yeah managers jim leland yeah but everyone just thought it was a given i mean it was god's given  destiny all the nationals thought it was a given we those of us who've been around we have seen them 
[01:28:30]  play really badly and so we were kind of going man i hope they don't you know play like they're 12  years old and and they did i mean my god it's just you know it's whatever whatever i mean we're  gonna be good for a long time that's after 19 years of completely sucking this is this is a wonderful  so you're hoping to have a second place dynasty for many years but you're uh we're hoping to improve 
[01:29:00]  upon that you know but uh we we'll see we'll see yeah i want to be the bills of uh baseball  yeah we were pulling for them because we're not on in st louis on terrestrial yeah yeah at least  we're honest that's the only reason you know we're trying to get in with the the fans of detroit  sucking up to detroit so we're like go tigers every day and plus the dirty yankees i was a yankee fan  my whole life and no longer yankee fan so i was very happy that they know why is that i just i met a  bunch of them i didn't like any of them none of them were nice to me except for except for jason johnby who 
[01:29:30]  i like very much jeter was an absolute creep it broke my heart uh even ron gidry wasn't very  pleasant uh none of them were nice except for except for so it's completely based on the fact  of how they relate to you to him personally would that be the case how derek jeter treated jimmy  norton at a charity event that jeter has been involved with since his rookie year where he's  given millions of dollars to underprivileged children he didn't treat jimmy good so he's a 
[01:30:00]  scumbag he wouldn't take a picture with jimmy is what it comes down he wouldn't take a picture  one lousy picture so jeff you better take a picture with jimmy after this interview or he  will trap you for years to come he holds a grudge like the jdl you could be holding an  oscar in your hand and he's going to say you stink no no no here's what happened i acknowledge  jeter greatest yankee second baseman in history first ballot hall of famer he's the captain of the  team as a player he's amazing i don't like him as a guy i got a photo with him i wanted him to sign  it three times i presented it to him to sign i've signed photos of myself with fans before 
[01:30:30]  and he wouldn't sign and he blew me off because i wasn't a chick and he did the same thing for  chicks that i was asking him to do did he say it's because you're not a chick that i don't  need to i would have respected him at least he was honest don't give me the slap in a minute buddy  and then pat i'm not your buddy i was your buddy you'd sign it really hurt me i'm 38 years old  and a younger half black half white boy hurt me he really did hurt you struck a chord jeff he's a  little bit of obsessive with his celebrity photos just just a little bit a little bit i like i love 
[01:31:00]  jeter i loved him since before he was a rookie i remember them talking about this kid derrick  jeter when when before they brought him up maybe the problem was you were hanging outside the men's  room during the whole event because you figured out that everybody no matter if you're uh just a  regular schmo or someone really famous you gotta take a leak oh that's where i hung outside the men's  he hung outside the men's room and got the guys coming out of the bathroom me and creepy roland  but i know roland's just whole demeanor just creeped everybody out and uh team wasn't nice none of  them were nice to me i was a rod uh he was not there i'm sure he wouldn't have been how could he be 
[01:31:30]  nice uh he wasn't he wasn't there so now a guy who wasn't even there yeah i've heard bad i've heard  bad things about you know who jimmy does like though uh randy johnson that's right because randy  johnson took that picture didn't he walking down 57th street we're in a diner with one of the  dallas cowboys and i'm such a fathead i see he sees randy johnson just lumbering by the you never  should see a human head at the height we were at and you see that stupid choking in the playoff 
[01:32:00]  giraffe head go by and ope goes it's it's randy johnson so we tell tyson waltz is a cowboy that  we're hanging out with i'm run out and ope's a good friend he follows me out the camera no i used to be a  good friend i used to be camera guy i used to be camera guy for the photos i couldn't take it  anymore so we passed that job on to roland right well he was camera but i was camera guy during  this one and on 57th street i caught up with randy i'm like randy i'm a big yankee fan can i get a  picture and he goes ah no thank you and he just leaves me there no thank you that's an odd answer  oh what a jackass no thank you like i offered him something he didn't have like like perhaps some 
[01:32:30]  gumption in the postseason would you care for a little gumption in the postseason  so i took a lot of pictures of randy johnson's ass for jimmy yeah that's all i could get because i  was in a panic like what do i do as the cameraman i got to get a picture of jimmy and randy johnson  somehow in the same frame yeah we put it up somewhere it was just a picture of me heartbroken  with him walking across the street just powering it tells me it's your approach yeah it's the attack  dog approach i i mean we we do live in an era i mean as a as a celebrity of sorts i we do kind of you 
[01:33:00]  know who's coming at me and is he packing but uh but i was very i was like i'm i i'm very uh very  few people very turn me down because i usually go can i just get a picture of us real quick like i  always had the camera ready and i've taken enough photos again not yankee status but i've taken enough  fan photos to know what drives me nuts and what's quick and let's go and when people with their fat  chicks with the camera phones then i want to stab them but when a guy goes try get a picture and he's  got the camera and then you go i have never have a problem with that and if i ever asked me to sign a photo 
[01:33:30]  with me and him with their problem now one of his favorites uh bob de niro he turned me down but he  was nice about it he was he's like if i take one a lot of people will ask but but i think it was why  is that nice because he was being honest and he was being truthful i've said that and i take one i  take 20 so yeah sometimes and it was at a it was an event where you were told not to bring cameras  and of course i see and he brought one so he broke the rules and his approach his approach has to be  the worst approach to a celebrity ever right i grant this is i audit this is a billy crystal's 
[01:34:00]  premiere for seven hundred sundays i i have the same and the names that are being dropped  just amazing isn't it some cowboy i've never heard of and now we're at billy crystal go ahead  billy crystal was really rude to me that night of course these are not name drops none of these  people care about me tyson walters got cut and uh billy crystal was really mean to me  so i don't know any of these people as an equal and none of them ever recognized me  and i went to i asked de niro i tapped his arm and i was touching we're touching a celebrity 
[01:34:30]  now yeah yeah him and his wife were walking up to billy and i tapped him and he turned around  and i go bob and i go bob i swear to god i'm touching bob bob i called him bob because i figured  that that like all his friends call him bob and he wouldn't realize that we've never met  he thought this out and uh he was very nice he wasn't a dick i know it's supposed to be a dick  and he wasn't what was i going to do argue and i was bummed out and i met yogi burr i got a picture  with him and didn't care now you uh you're a very recognizable guy extremely so uh what about that 
[01:35:00]  autographs pictures you you get that a lot but you're you're also from kind of a small town though  yeah i mean they tend to leave me alone i mean they know why i'm there which is not to do that so  but yeah yeah you you know there there are things you do you don't make eye contact with people who  call you by your first name as if they're your friend yeah you don't make eye contact you just keep  going you go hey how are you and you don't stop walking you keep going and can i get a picture  yeah and you keep walking yeah oh my god it's a picture on the run yeah absolutely the other good 
[01:35:30]  one is you know i had one guy you know it's the it's the restaurant story you know that everybody  goes through celebrities go through which is uh you're in the mid you the spoon is halfway up from  the soup and the guy sticks his cell phone in my ear and goes say something funny to my girlfriend  oh well i took the phone and i said i knew your boyfriend when he was gay and then i just handed 
[01:36:00]  it back to him and he was he was shall we say upset really yeah and uh didn't care you know  something i could think a couple of more things that really would have upset her  yeah that's true but that's a disgusting thing to bother a guy while he's eating like that like  that wouldn't i had guys do that to me it's very irritating and i would never do that to another i  would never bother if i saw you in public i would want to meet you because i think you're great but  i would never bother you while you're eating food ever while you're holding a baby i would never  bother you while you're holding a kid either but no i saw i saw heidi heidi klum and seal and i 
[01:36:30]  wanted to go grab to heal yeah walking and i want to want to say has your father seen this but i  wanted to get no i wanted to get a oh my i wanted to get a picture obviously they were carrying a kid  and it's like then you don't bother somebody they have a little baby so i mean i have limits i'm not  a maniac you know derek jeter's not a second baseman right oh did i see second baseman i was just  nervous he's a shortstop i was talking nervous talking okay because they will not leave that  i know what he does he's a say a shortstop i just said it as a speech mistake not yeah don't 
[01:37:00]  worry about it i know where he does i don't think he's a center fielder how often you uh go to  hollywood make movies go to california a lot la not a lot not a lot no i mean i i when i was uh  canada all through the yeah it's a lot of canada but it's um a lot of through the 90s you know when  i was going out for meetings and stuff quite a bit um i i was famous i guess in michigan for i'd 
[01:37:30]  take the nine o'clock plane out of detroit fly and land at noon la time do rent a car do the meeting  at three see a friend and then get on the red eye back home i never took my coat off really really  didn't you know it's you know a nice place for some people but i just didn't want to be there you  just like uh michigan i just yeah it's home you know it's home and it's been great for the kids  and that's where we decided to raise the kids and if you want me for a movie call me i'll come to you  but you know don't make me live out there do people figure out like where you live and just go there for 
[01:38:00]  that purpose to snap a picture or yeah we get we get the parade of people going you lose past the house  i'm just a monkey in a cage and yeah there i am out you know raking leaves or something  look he's doing he's doing housework yeah that is so odd mother she's about to die  yeah that's the gate she's at the gate out by the driveway yeah oh man say hello to grandma or you  don't know let her die you know well they hand you the cell phone and you're gonna smell their stupid 
[01:38:30]  breath in their self that's the most disgusting thing when they hand you a phone well it's the  cell phone people that don't know how to work it too can i get just a you know and it's 30 seconds  it's a minute it's a minute and a half and we still have to figure out how to use it it's like  you have a camera ready and be quick and and shut up i like your stuff and shut your mouth and go  that's why celebrities don't take pictures because people do stuff like the guys eating soup they ruin  it they wreck it for the rest of us who are true sociopaths with their half a pixel camera phone 
[01:39:00]  their girlfriend's taking her she doesn't know how to work and she's dumb well so are you stupid  so are you for dating her and not having a digital hey hope i don't get yelled at for making fun of  digital cameras are these sponsors too jeff is here promoting an evening with jeff daniels by the  way uh you go to jeff daniels.com yeah for the tour dates but the next one is what uh tonight uh  south orange performing arts center yes uh tonight and then there's tomorrow night is in the polytheater  in uh west long branch new jersey jeez you're doing stuff all over somerville uh a cellarsville 
[01:39:30]  pennsylvania on sunday you got a gig every night man uh this is there's four straight this weekend  yeah birdland in new york on monday and but you know the website i've got this uh cd got another  cd coming out on november 20th and the proceeds go to help this theater company i have in michigan so  uh i'm you know i'm very aware that the last thing the world needs is another actor singer songwriter but  but what do you like to do better act or uh well the acting thing is great between action and cut  you know that's that's what i was trained for that's what i went to school for and 
[01:40:00]  learned how to do um was was the acting thing so between action and cut it's great right it's just  you know when you're working with people who graduated cum laude from star school you know  that's a whole different deal you know and so that that that side of the business i could care less  about you pick uh your own scripts or you know you're you're got an agent or something because  you've done something a lot of people haven't been able to do uh dumb and dumber was a huge movie  you could have been completely just typecast into that but you you went into other roles uh 
[01:40:30]  played some bad people well dumb and dumber completely confused those who cast things  because leading up to that point there was no indication that i could be remotely funny at all  and doing dumb and dumber uh we you know jim um jim wasn't jim yet jim was ace ventura mask hadn't  come out yet and so he was he was i mean he we were halfway through shooting that movie and he broke  and he couldn't have been better for me um you know and i was told jim's gonna wipe you off the 
[01:41:00]  screen you're you're with one of the great comedic minds and he's a tornado and look out and i'm going  no no no no and jim had said i need an actor with me i don't need another comedian i need an actor  with me who can make me listen and two guys and that make me react and so he couldn't have been  better and nicer about you know the setups i mean you know as you guys know from comedy  no punchline if you don't have a setup and jim worked as hard on the setups as he does 
[01:41:30]  did on the punchline you're downplaying it you held your own man well yeah you completely held  your own i had scenes that you know when the agent said uh you it's jeff it's a bad move you're going  to get you know uh killed and i'm going well wait a minute i'm on the toilet by myself snowballing the  head by myself the tongue in the pole by myself unless they cut the scenes out of the movie i've  at least got three where i'm you know can excel and then the other stuff's with jim and then smartly i  just said you know what jim is is going to do what jim's going to do and and you want that i want that 
[01:42:00]  so i made the character that i played the follower make jim the leader make me the follower and  and uh and not try to compete with him just kind of try to follow along like the dog behind him you  own did you get a lot of offers though like to do a bunch of goofy movies like bad scripts that  are just like hey he did so well in this let's cast him in this goofy movie but but i gambled and  it worked well because there had been a lot of dramas and and stuff before that and and clint was 
[01:42:30]  a great example uh i did a movie called blood work with clint which is basically you know dirty harry at  72 pretty much but but you know who better than clint but uh clint said if you can do dumb and dumber  and you can do some of the other stuff you've done before that you can do this it's a great  clint impression man wow oh no i can do better well he's got his guitar right before he shot  in blood work which was by the way a great honor to be shot and killed by by clint eastwood come on 
[01:43:00]  that's a long line of uh you're gonna have with clint it's a long line of people oh and he said and  he's on the set you know and he's got this routine he does with his with his crew and he  you know he says uh how many people have i killed you know about five thousand sir make it five thousand  and it's and it's you yeah it's you god you gotta wonder if he keeps count you know that's pretty 
[01:43:30]  cool i even had my own little line right before he killed me which was uh i never liked you buddy  which i thought was pretty great and then he blew me away yeah that's nice to be killed by clint  eastwood sure yeah we'll take that in real life well let's get the song out of jeff you want to play  yeah well there's one uh there's that one i'll play a piece of that one it is it's called the  dirty hairy blues it's uh it was about getting shot and killed by clint  well i've had more than my share the brushes with greatness but with all humility i would

[01:54:00]  who jeff is they just get nervous you've been mistaken for somebody that's just like not even  close yeah they tell me i look like steve colbert had a stroke steve colbert that's not bad i got  yafet koto once i had odd job one time odd job that's good i whipped off a derby and i broke all the  statues and the other villain yeah oh wow i didn't know who that was hey bob uh you're still  not cursing on one versus a hundred no i i have been at the breaks tonight is uh you know tonight's 
[01:54:30]  the big uh last of the five and then i'm doing ten more i don't think i curse but i do touch one of  the contestants uh internally oh now that's one to tune into that's what i'm saying that got past the  censors huh yeah we did a whole uh a special uh for charity a pap smear episode  bob is very dirty when he's when he's not doing the full house well i saw him on the aristocrats  i thought he was just outrageous how great is the aristocrat oh my god it's just great i love that 
[01:55:00]  movie because it's unfiltered man these guys that you know from all walks of life just getting as  dirty as humanly possible i've never seen it yeah i haven't seen it's really worth watching i know  it just depresses me that all these guys i know are in a movie i'm not in so i'm just yeah  there's use of the word bucket like i'd never heard it i didn't know bucket i asked my mom did  she want to see it she said it wasn't her cup of poo so she didn't want to see it yeah hey jeff i got 
[01:55:30]  an idea yeah i mean uh bob sorry i'm looking at jeff as i say that bob uh for a future episode of  one versus 100 how about you fill the the the uh hundred with ona pests you know what you we  actually are going to put some people that show business is not a reason to not put people in  those boxes so we're going to have you know cheerleaders and nuclear physicists and i think  we should have the uh some of you guys and some of your virus members sitting up there i think we  should make that happen i can make that happen i think as long as i pretend i don't know any of you 
[01:56:00]  well i mean no we'll just pick some uh uber fans of the opian anthony show the ona pest and then  and you want to see promotion for your your stupid show man we'll do it right i mean your your great  show no it's both that's the beauty of it hey i've got on record i love uh one versus 100  no you have done that and i think it helps make it the great show that it could be if it wasn't so  stupid it's a fun show to watch and i dress up in a magician's outfit and then i i feel around the 
[01:56:30]  deal or no deal models if they show up yeah and i'm going to see you this week bob i'm going to see  you uh actually is it next week i'm seeing you on friday night in vegas you are doing uh we're  gonna have fun uh jim norton and myself and paula bell and jeff ross are doing this uh 1 a.m show  at caesars on november 17th yeah i'm coming out for that and uh i'm reading a review you got  and here's why i'm mentioning it's a bad review but this the woman didn't like you obviously because 
[01:57:00]  you were dirty that's it she was probably a full house fan tina parker i haven't seen a bad review  in a while because i try not to but thank god you've got it i'm not gonna read i'm only gonna i'm gonna  read one part because the lines she quotes are funny lines this is well well could you start with  the first paragraph though i mean she's got some terrific writing here oh yeah tina parker this  is ohio she's just obviously some midwestern boob who wanted clean comedy i'm performing i'm in i'm  in cleveland tomorrow night so this is probably a date from a week ago or something it says wait 
[01:57:30]  till you hear what comes out of his mouth you'll feel like you need a shower dash or a shot of  penicillin which is usually what goes into jimmy's mouth she didn't like your language but the the line  she quotes you see i was danny tanner he said that's effed up and then did you guys watch full  house growing up he asked when the members of the audience nodded their heads he replied fags  that's a funny line and then you know what it is i i violated her at the end of the night i felt bad 
[01:58:00]  about that dude i and then you go john stamos and i were gay he said well he was gay i just laid  there i think that is a really funny line and that's why i know she didn't thank you man they're good  they're good jokes she didn't like it just because you were dirty and it's like there are people who  just don't like the fact that you're dirty they go expecting something different now i know she  wants me to have a bouffant hairdo and raise children with synthesizer music in the background  on stage hey take it on the road if to me if you have a child and you're doing a morality play and 
[01:58:30]  you've got synthesizer music you're doing porn well we know what our bad review is about and that's all  it is it's it's like a phony it's almost like she can't just come out and go i needed to see this  because i came expecting some wholesome you know what i mean people just can't admit that they  didn't like what they heard because they wanted something clean who's still seeing bob saget thinking  they're gonna get that that tanner character obviously this ohio dope no one knew he was so  dirty until the aristocrats came out except for the people in the in the comedy world but all his 
[01:59:00]  friends us average joes we had no idea bob saget was this filthy it's pretty they're still figuring out  you're not really average joes though well yeah but you're funny man oh you did the gigs with us  to travel and i'm not just saying this but you did the gigs with us and our audiences are brutal  they don't care if you're dirty or not if you're not funny you're gonna get screamed at and they  they will like loved you you were like the star of the show every time which was you know really  good for me to see as one of the guys on the show you know he's happy for a buddy  to outshine you you know hey bob by the way we were asking jeff during the break do you watch 
[01:59:30]  uh full house do you watch your stuff you know i've got a bed that vibrates and i just lay there  and you know i get a little corn oil no i've never i never really watch it no because sometimes i'll  walk in on my youngest room and i'll walk in and i'll see that i'm in a dinosaur outfit  we'll just unplug the set just throw something through it so there's no daddy you were wearing  an all black leather zip outfit i think i better be the gimp in pulp fiction 
[02:00:00]  when you were doing bob when you were doing america's funniest home videos were there like  lines that you really wanted to do that you know you could have snuck through but they panicked and  said no to yeah and i did some like if you watch the last couple years there was subliminal stuff i  would say things like well these clips are going to spew into your face before you know things like  but you know it was a blooper show and then you know not i was on it eight years so you you do the  best you can and i did it you know i just it was a job and i took it because i thought it was funny 
[02:00:30]  when i took it hey bob now that uh a lot of people are finding out that you are this dirty  has anyone approached you to do the same show but uh a dirty version no the weirdest thing is when  people come up to me and try to get me to have sex with them like couples and stuff that's like  really messed up really i performed last night at uh at george washington university and when we went  out afterward for a little bit the other guys and myself that are on the show just the ryan stouts  the guy opening for me and this guy comes up and goes i loved you growing up and then he tries to 
[02:01:00]  grab my head to kiss me moon and uh they the bouncer like grabbed him right away and he kissed him  wait was it a mouth kiss or a cheek kiss he tried to do a mouth kiss with a with a it was like with  a tongue it was like a baby bird falling out of a nest it was not good ew why was it was he gay  was he just wanted to violate you and say he did it i didn't look like a guy that would normally do  something like this i think it was because i was danny canner that he thought that that would be the 
[02:01:30]  way to go yeah wow and he was drunk obviously he was on some kind of booze that allows you to  all of a sudden uh want a man to put his tongue in your mouth was there synthesizer music playing  there was in the background i told him how wrong that is to do in a bar yeah what a creep at least  get you a room yeah i know i know but it was it's really uh i'm gonna do uh cleveland tomorrow night  and hopefully that same lady will come to the show i mean that's the thing you know someone that said 
[02:02:00]  all the jokes that i said are so horrific that do they know they sound okay to me i hope she'll  probably come back that's what they do they come back dude those are funny lines and that's that's  the uh the bible when someone's quoting lines and saying these are inappropriate and they're funny  lines it's just like you why are you writing about comedy you dumb broad just stand over stand over some  laundry and kvetch with your fat neighbors that's what you should be doing  so bob bob it's jeff you must really enjoy the fact that you're you know you're known for the 
[02:02:30]  full house thing i mean and the other shows you've done but to walk out on stage and the shock factor  in the first 10 minutes right you got to get off on that yeah it really is it's it's like uh you know  it's like thrown on a surfboard and just go and i just jump on it but i'm not and what's fun is  i just start talking like that because that's what i get like in front of a lot of people it's not like  i go oh this is what i'm going to open with this is where the f-bomb should drop you know it's like  i just talk like i talk but and that's the most fun part sometimes when you when you're going to go 
[02:03:00]  filthy you earn it supposedly as a performer i just i can't i don't have time i don't have time to live  so i just hit it hard you know but the fun of seeing the blood drain from the faces of the state  of ohio is what happened he was i just watched him last night on tv it was so sweet it's got to be put in  gutters it's got it's blood pouring through the gutters apocalypse now there's heads in the front  road good for you when you did dumb and dumber and you had the uh the big uh you know the big 
[02:03:30]  bathroom scene absolutely you know that for the rest of your life people say that's the funniest  and most uh you know for some upsetting scene but it's still the most one of the most hilarious  because it crossed the line did did was that movie that movie was highly received the moment it  came out wasn't it yeah i mean we thought uh 15 year old boys would think it was great and that's  what the agents thought and it was like well if that's what it is okay and broke into comedy in 
[02:04:00]  the film world but no we weren't prepared for you know the fact that it's still being laughed at by  people of all ages and you know that i remember that scene i i'm the fairly brothers i right before  i did it i said to peter i said you know this is either the beginning of my career or the end of it  he goes no no man it's gonna be great it's gonna be and it really was it really i really uh you know  if that's on the tombstone that's on the tombstone it makes people laugh you know well you know you  now i get too graphic but you filled the toilet with diarrhea and then the toilet broke so you take 
[02:04:30]  the lid off putting it on top of the toilet that we know is full yes and then you do work on that i think  it was almost like a hitchcock movie knowing that under that lid it was completely full that to me  is really disturbing there's really been no maintenance of your character and they even cut  the part later why i had unattached the toilet and i was pouring what was in the toilet out the window 
[02:05:00]  down they cut they cut that the whole scene became like a one-act play yeah that should be on the dvd  that ought to be on the dvd man that's funny oh that is funny i can't get enough of it all right bob  we gotta uh they're gonna move on yeah they're gonna kick us out of here soon so what is friday night  the show let's let's get a plug for the show too man it's you're on every friday night i'm on uh the  the one versus 100 is on tonight and then we take i don't know what they're putting on next friday but

[02:06:00]  jim oh it's cool i'm going on at 2 30 you know in vegas i'm sure there won't be any drinking it'll  probably be a really great time to go on and perform some comedy a bunch of savages just lost  their life savings in a casino staring at me i hope that lady's there oh the uh her name is uh  she's from ohio her name is tina parker and she writes something called laugh track and this is how you  know it's gonna be a quality article next to laugh track it has some fake chatter teeth  which is always the sign of a great comedy writer when they have fake chatter teeth by the title of 
[02:06:30]  their article with the smacker face of the rock why do you need the rock maybe jeff maybe you could  come to him we could all pitch in and give her some diarrhea absolutely i'll show up with a little  mason jar brown liquid they love that well thank you guys all right bob see you soon man always a  pleasure bob saget everyone all right one versus a hundred tonight i love the show it's it's it's  entertaining all right we're just about out of here jeff it's been a pleasure thanks guys glad 
[02:07:00]  you came in man um jeff daniels.com and then tonight um uh in south orange performing arts center  and uh you can get this a gig every night uh tomorrow night he's in uh west long branch just go  to jeff daniels.com and then monday night i want to see the show at birdland here in new york city  a seven o'clock show and uh you know goes for a good cause all the money and believe it or not  we're still trying to figure out what this sound is this japanese thing  is 
[02:07:30]  Any guesses, Jeff?  That's just stunning.  Isn't it?  We're trying to figure out what that is. 
[02:08:00]  That it passes for culture.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  No, I have no idea.  Let me see.  Someone has a guess here.  Let's go to JR in Virginia.  JR.  How you doing?  Hey.  I'm going to speak with you guys.  I'm nervous little Nelly here.  But my guess is a Japanese game show where a man's ass is being forced into another man's face by way of a moving table.  Well, the Japanese are wacky.  By way of a moving table.  But that's another wrong answer. 
[02:08:30]  I don't think so, no.  Another wrong answer.  Let's say hi to Nate in New Jersey.  Nate, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, can I take a guess if that sounds?  Please do.  I thought you wanted to say hi to Jeff there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I didn't know you were still taking calls for him.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's still here.  Go ahead.  Okay.  What's up, Jeff?  How you doing?  Good, man.  I'm a big fan of you.  Thank you.  I just want to know, what's it like to work with Jim Carrey?  Is he a douche like a lot of people say he is?  No.  No.  I mean, you know, it's...  What are all these people that say he's a douche? 
[02:09:00]  I know.  Are you in the know?  I've never heard that.  No.  No, I've got to say it before.  He couldn't have been more generous and nice.  And to be honest, got me the job on Dumb and Dumber.  He really wanted me, and I was greatly appreciative.  I mean, that was my experience with him.  Sir, I'll admit I was a little nervous meeting Jeff because I'm a fan, but that was the worst  fan question I've ever heard.  What was it like working with Jim Carrey?  That was just awful.  Could you ask him a real question?  The guy's a real actor.  Let's try one more here.  Mark in Michigan.  You're on with Jeff Daniels.  Hey, Jeff.  Just wanted to say you freaking rock, and I got a guess on that, man. 
[02:09:30]  It's a Japanese porno flick, and that little tink-ting you hear?  Look at Ben Walls dropping...  Ben Walls dropping out of someone's ass.  Yeah, how'd you do this?  Great.  Well, I guess that's how we end.  I thought he had a question for Jeff Daniels.  JeffDaniels.com for all the concert dates, okay?  And if you're in New York City tonight, I'm at the Hammerstein Ballroom, 8 o'clock show.  I'm doing it with our own sweet Nathaniel and my friends Artie Fuqua and Gino, who has 
[02:10:00]  toured with me before.  He's very funny.  Tonight at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Jimmy, I'll be there supporting you.  Thanks, sweet.  Also, today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  It's a pleasure, Jeff.  Jeff Daniels, everyone.  Thanks, man.  Come by and see us again, all right?  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have yourself a great weekend.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show, coming soon 
[02:10:30]  to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerate shopping for Christmas  presents, and you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden funds is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless 
[02:11:00]  shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Bye.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hey, they're deciding.  Oh, nice.  Hey, there it is. 
[02:11:30]  Are we on the radio?  Oh, stupid Danny didn't turn my mic on.  I had to do it all by myself.  Danny is stupid.  Where's that?  Danny is a boob.  I'm already walking.  Where are you?  Look at this way over there.  I'm down the sidewalk already.  He's between 9th and 10th.  We're hanging with our fans here.  What's wrong with you?  I did that when I walked out.  Did you?  Well, there's a lot of people outside Free FM today, and I was asking because there's 
[02:12:00]  a lot of new faces.  Usually we see the same old faces day in and day out.  Yeah.  But a lot of new faces today.  The reason?  Little Jimmy Norton playing the Hammerstein Ballroom tonight here in New York City.  Oh.  He's being so nice.  People have traveled from Philly.  Where else?  Indiana.  Indiana to see Jimmy?  Jesus, boy, are you going to regret that plankton?  What a dope.  Huh?  Dude, Florida to come see you.  Wow, we're in Florida.  Orlando.  Orlando.  Oh, thank you very much.  Also, Brooklyn. 
[02:12:30]  Brooklyn.  Wow, that's far.  How's my attempt at humor today?  Oh, it was a good one because we said different states, and then you jumped in with Brooklyn,  and people were like, whoa.  Oh, wow.  I need that pressure.  No Andrew again.  I know.  That's not good.  Enough with him already.  Fuck him.  He has one cake stepped on.  All of a sudden, his life is over.  But they aren't there.  Exactly.  We should give the new people the tour, by the way.  I agree.  Take a picture of that empty sidewalk right near the fence.  That's where the cake stomping took place.  That's a very famous site here on the walkover to XM. 
[02:13:00]  What else can we point out?  Hopefully, one of them under the wheels of a bus.  And today.  Oh, sorry.  Come on, Ant.  Oh, look at the camel toe on this one.  Ah.  Oh.  See?  It's cold.  I told you.  Black girl.  Big tits.  You like that?  I certainly do.  Jimmy thinks you have big tits.  Oh, I didn't think.  Ow.  Sorry. 
[02:13:30]  Hi.  Ant, sir.  How are you?  What are we doing?  What's your name?  Francine.  You're Francine.  Wow.  And what do you do?  Nothing.  Do you do real estate?  Yes, I do.  Don't stick that big black microphone in her face.  We're interviewing her.  Francine, what the fuck are you doing out?  I'm off work today.  Are you single?  Are you single, Nick?  I'm not currently talking.  I'll be shoving the microphone into her eye and her cheek. 
[02:14:00]  Well, she has to talk, so we're interviewing.  Thank you.  So where are you going?  Why are you on your way?  I wanted to come hang out with you guys.  Oh, so you just came for the walk?  Yeah, and I missed it.  Well, no, we're halfway through with it, so you're catching half of it.  I missed half of it.  You missed half, so you can join us for the rest of it.  Can I?  Yes, you can.  Can I hang out today?  Yeah.  I got nothing to do.  Two diamonds.  Two diamonds.  Two diamonds.  Opie, that is not a renaissance sword you have. 
[02:14:30]  It is a microphone, and she shouldn't be bludgeoned over the head with it.  If you want to hit someone, wait, wait, wait, who wants to play a new game?  Raise your hand.  It depends.  No, no, no depending.  You either play or you don't play.  Oh, I like games.  I'll play.  All right, let's play poke the witch.  Poke the witch.  I'm not a witch.  Poke the witch.  Your zipper's down.  Hey, you're not poking, Jimmy.  Is it?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, why is your zipper down?  Wow.  Are you a tranny?  I wish.  I love you.  Me too.  Do you wear any underwear? 
[02:15:00]  Yes, I do wear underwear.  All right, let's go buy some gay porn, everybody.  Yay.  Gay porn for everyone.  Gay porn.  Look at this.  Hi.  Arms around each other.  We're in love.  Good.  Let's look at people.  Francine's between.  Look at this.  That's great.  That's right.  It's like a couple of plantation owners going in.  Going to have a little fun.  Why?  I know.  I don't have the bell.  Nice dumper.  What happened?  That's patty. 
[02:15:30]  I was looking at your ass, patty.  It's not bad.  I look at a nice ass, it was patty's.  Oh, we should have played poke the witch with her.  She looks more like a witch.  Poke the witch.  Look at that chubby hiding.  Poke the witch.  Patty, that's nice.  Patty.  Poke the witch.  Do you speak Greek?  Poke the witch.  Be god, witch.  Be god.  Be god.  Poke the witch.  Poke the witch.  Poke the witch.  Poke the witch.  Uh-huh.  Stop being cranky, lady.  We're all having fun.  Fuck off.  Be god. 
[02:16:00]  Patty's dumper is nice.  Hey, Patty.  Are you digging Patty's ass?  Yes.  You would hit that?  Patty, you're not ready for regular sex, but would you let me Greek you?  Oh, wow.  Right from nothing to ass sex.  I don't know what that is.  That means you'd take a big hard one in your asshole.  I got all my test results back yesterday.  Patty, I don't have anything.  I thought I might have had gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia.  But you've got nothing.  How about a big Cialis card on of your asshole?  How about 100 milligrams crammed into your dumper? 
[02:16:30]  I'm preserving my butt.  Preserving it.  Preserving it.  Yeah.  All right.  Poke the wits.  Poke the wits.  Poke the wits.  Patty's tiny is nice.  You like her?  You know, I was pushing my microphone, like, trying to shove it up her ass, and it was really,  like, soft.  Her ass is really soft, like, in a bad way.  Anthony's cute.  He's all bundled.  I know.  He has a baseball hat and his little hood.  I'm freezing. 
[02:17:00]  By the way, for all the newbies, this is where we buy our gay porn.  That's right.  Yeah.  Hello, my friend.  When we're feeling a little saucy.  I'm fine, sir.  Do you have FHM?  FHM not came out yet, my friend.  Oh, this guy, you said tomorrow.  Yeah.  You keep saying tomorrow.  Freshman in?  But we are in that magazine.  But I have your favorite stuff.  Oh, our favorite stuff, he calls it now.  Yeah, he doesn't have the latest FHM, but he has the latest gay porn.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  What do you think?  Could you hand me freshman?  Freshman?  You want freshman?  You want freshman?  Don't act like you don't know where it is.  It's in plastic, Jimmy.  Oh, it's wrapped in plastic.  You want to go with all boy or unzipped today?  Unzipped.  Oh, righty.  Unzipped.  Oh, my God.  Bill Burr on the cover of Unzipped.  Yeah.  There's...  Oh, wait a minute.  There you go, Jimmy.  Why don't you peruse the Unzipped magazine for everybody?  Hold on, sir.  All right.  This is the right one, maybe.  Hold on, sir.  That's a good one you like?  You like that one?  Oh, this guy loves when we come.  Unzipped.  Sir, wow. 
[02:18:00]  That's fake.  That's not real, sir.  Is that...  You see the color?  It's not real, yeah.  That's not real.  It's just transformation.  Yeah.  I mean, I prefer a delicious cock like the rest of us do, but that one's not real.  Oh, I don't know.  What are you, sir?  Do you prefer a chest...  Do you prefer a big chested man?  Look at that.  Oh, that's a working...  He's enjoying that one.  That's a regular working Joe.  Hey, sir.  He's going to work totally nude with a hard on.  Thank you.  Hey, sir.  Do you...  Yeah, put it right in front of me.  Hey, guys.  Hey, freshman.  Yeah, yeah.  Right next to us, magazine. 
[02:18:30]  That's perfect.  Hey, do you have Steppin' Out magazine?  Which one?  Steppin' Out.  No, man.  Steppin' Out, I don't.  Our buddy Jimmy Norton is on the cover of Steppin' Out magazine.  Can I have a copy of All Boy?  All right.  God Almighty.  There you go, Jimmy.  All right.  I can't even get my hard on during this.  Oh, it looks like a young Leo DiCaprio.  Fresh-faced young boy would be in All Boy magazine.  I want to push mustard in his face and rape him.  All right.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Ugh.  That's...  What's wrong with this guy's penis?  It's two colors.  It's uncut and...  Look at this red. 
[02:19:00]  Look at a dog dick.  What's wrong with this guy?  It looks like he's wearing a meat sock on it.  He dipped it in Jell-O.  I don't like his fucking Doogie Howser face either.  Well, it would be appropriate.  It certainly would be.  Oh, that guy is gaping for you.  Oh, boy.  Look.  I think he's gay.  All right.  I think he's gay.  He's spreading his ass cheeks open.  Over here.  Over here.  Just leave.  All right.  Well, is this ours?  Oh, no.  It's for you?  Oh, well.  Thank you to the fan.  Thank you.  Sir, I didn't steal this.  She-mail international. 
[02:19:30]  This has transgender people from all countries, I suspect.  Come on, races and creeds.  That's good.  All right.  We'll have to look at this.  It's all black and white.  Yeah, I'll look at this later alone and make some jokes.  Let's cross the street or attempt that.  All right.  Thank you.  Danny, carry this, Danny.  Thank you, sir.  We have a newsstand at the corner of 6th Avenue and 57th Street.  Thank you.  Visit him.  Buy your magazine, your gay pornography.  All right.  We'll hang it right up front.  Oh, it's up front.  Someone put it up front.  No, we didn't steal it.  Can't see now. 
[02:20:00]  Are you arresting us, sir?  Oh, okay.  NYPD just wants to say hi.  All right.  New York's finest.  That's right, sir.  How are you?  Is this you right here?  No, you're the best.  No, you can park wherever you want.  Hey, what happened to the front here?  You have to do one of those pit maneuvers.  He can't hear you.  Nail some perp.  Wow, man.  In front of the car is banged up.  Yeah, hopefully it was hitting some people of questionable racial background.  Fuck, why now?  Why do you have to go there?  I love this red-headed guy. 
[02:20:30]  Look at him.  He's in terrific shape.  What is that?  Who is he on a message board?  Oof.  Are you on a message board?  This corner's turned into a little Hong Kong.  I don't want to actually want to keep my fucking job.  What do you do?  Kill people.  Yeah, I'm a fat suburban housewife.  You're a good boy.  Thank you.  Why is the corner here turning into a little...  I don't know.  Why don't we talk to them?  We've talked to them once so far.  Let's talk to the one of questionable gender.  All right.  Hello. 
[02:21:00]  Hello.  How are you, sir?  Fine.  How are you doing?  Oh, good.  Hi.  We're from the Open Anthony Radio Program.  What do you do?  You have a little name badge on there.  Yeah.  Department of Consumer Affairs.  Yes.  Who are you?  Oh, that's a badge because you sell hats.  Yes.  Oh.  This gentleman's on the corner.  We're going to give you a nice plug on the radio.  6th Avenue and 57th.  And can I look at one of your cashmere hats?  Sure.  Oh, we should tell the people that he's quite old and you could probably steal stuff right 
[02:21:30]  in front of him.  Jimmy's going to try on a pink hat, a pink number for everybody.  This is going to be a photo op for the people joining us on the walk over here.  Oh, he looks like that little murdered girl in Florida.  Oh, my God.  You look like a progeria kid.  Sir, how much is this hat?  Ten.  Ten dollars.  Ten dollars.  Bargain it down.  This is like Bangladesh or something.  No, I want this hat.  No, give him eight. 
[02:22:00]  No, give him eight.  Eight bucks, that hat.  We'll take eight, right?  You'll take eight.  You'll take eight bucks?  You'll take eight or we'll take that crook of yours.  You take eight?  How about nine?  Oh, Jimmy's got a pink hat.  All right.  Yes, sir, you owe me ten.  Jimmy pays him in full.  Oh, you gave him a 20.  Now it's a $20 hat.  Don't try to knock it down.  That neighborhood's influencing you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There it is.  That is a nice hat.  That certainly is.  You are a flaming fag. 
[02:22:30]  No, I'm not.  I'm a man's man in a real man's hat.  Hey, are these, uh...  Are you legal?  Illegal?  What do you got?  Legal?  Oh, legal.  Sure.  Might be illegal there.  Are you a something trapped in a something's body?  All right.  All right.  No?  Don't speak English.  All right.  All right.  That's a safe way to stay in the country.  It certainly is.  Don't fess up to anything.  Look at Steve in his JÃ¤germeister jacket.  Hello.  Oh, Steve's just a creep.  Yeah, he is.  He looks like he's...  Oh, look at his little gloves.  Look at his fucking...  I can pick up a dime gloves. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, faggot gloves.  All right, hat.  I'm...  Remember what hat you're wearing?  Look at his awful fucking woman gloves.  Oh, use that for driving your hybrid car there, Steve.  Those gloves are horrible.  Yes, I do.  Thank you very much.  I'm cold, Jimmy.  I'm chilly.  I know.  Listen, get fucking warm gloves, not those fucking warm-fitting ones.  Look at them.  Little each finger.  Those are warmer gloves.  See, they're lined.  Yeah, I know, but I can't...  And even...  I'm Mr. Cold Guy, and I'm not wearing gloves. 
[02:23:30]  I can't hold on to anything.  Those are driving gloves.  Are they?  They don't pass your wrists, Steve.  What?  They don't...  Those are not gloves.  They're...  They're ghouls.  They're low-carb gloves.  Those are fucking awful.  They're fine.  There's nothing wrong with them.  All right, moving on.  Everything wrong with them.  Exactly.  Moving on.  If you're a woman living on the Upper East Side, there's nothing wrong with them.  What's wrong with them?  Your name is Helen.  We got a huge crowd today.  We certainly do.  All for Jimmy Norton playing the Hammerstein Ballroom tonight.  Oh, wait a minute.  You're in town early.  There's nothing funny about Thanksgiving until now. 
[02:24:00]  It's Helen.  Helen with a turkey on her head.  With a turkey on her head.  It would have been funnier if it was a cock.  Bah!  Because we all know she doesn't like cocks.  They've been inconsolent.  That's great.  All right.  Anything else new on the board?  What's funny about a turkey on someone's head?  Nothing.  That hat on yours, maybe, but...  It's soft.  Stop touching it.  It makes me laugh.  I didn't mean your hat, but your cock. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, boy.  What do you think the movie Candy's about?  Subtitled, More is Never Enough.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Looks awful.  Keith Ledger.  Who's this dame?  Yeah.  She plays the piano.  Simone Dinnerstein.  We're just looking at the wall.  Tenacious D, the pick of Destiny.  Brand new album.  November 14th.  Live at the Garden on December 1st.  They're going to be doing the show in the very near future.  Wow.  And this Tupac is really starting to piss us off. 
[02:25:00]  I know.  Roland's trying to get him in.  At this point, you might as well.  His latest album came out, or is coming out on the 21st of the month.  Guy gives me a picture to sign.  I'm looking at the picture, and he points where he wants it signed.  I like that.  I'm looking like I'm trying to figure out who's me.  I was looking at the picture.  You adult.  Yeah.  Jesus, our fans are stupid.  All right.  Look at the tits on that monster.  I want to suck all of them and just make degrading Seymour.  Seymour.  I fucking suck. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, you tried it twice.  You tried it twice.  Get the papers.  Get the papers.  Before we go in, can we play Poke the Witch again?  I kind of like that game.  Me too.  Where's Stalker Patty?  Where did Patty go?  Patty!  Patty!  Patty, you coming up for the show today?  Patty!  Look at this cute girl.  Do we lose Stalker Patty?  Come on up, Patty.  Patty, are you coming up for the show today?  Yeah, I'm just going to hang out.  Poke the Witch!  Poke the Witch!  Poke the Witch!  Poke the Witch!  Slam it up her ass.  Hey, let me play that with AIDS needles. 
[02:26:00]  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're going to get as many of you guys up here as possible.  Girls.  Just girls?  No, guys too.  Just girls today?  No, guys too.  And one guy?  I hate one lucky guy.  No, not for me.  Mr. Faggot hat.  Cut it out.  He's trying to fend himself with the worst big hat ever.  That's a horrible hat.  All right, what do they do, Kenny?  I'll organize it.  You go upstairs and get ready.  Why don't you tattle on us again, fathead?  I hate that fathead. 
[02:26:30]  That's the one?  I think so.  He's a fathead.  What do they do?  Fathead outside having fun.  I don't care for that.  This mommy's boy.  Mommy's trying to get her son up there.  I'll let her son come up.  I say yes.  Well, does mama suck cock?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Was that not appropriate?  I say yes.  Let her up.  I'm getting inside.  Line up against the building.  My God.  Let her up.  Hey, thank you.  We've got a huge crowd.  They'll be upstairs for the XM portion of the show, where we pretty much just call it in until 11.15. 
[02:27:00]  We'll see you upstairs.  Opie and Anthony XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:27:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:28:00]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You know I could have been a boy.  You know I could have been a man today.  I'm dead. 
[02:28:30]  You know.  I think I'm dead.  You know how ugly are you going to be dark?  I think you're missing.  I think you are the best palaver.  It's a little brother last night.  I think you ask me.  You know it's a suggestion and you can't be a medicine.  You do it.  Don't ask you.  You know we sing through.  I mean I don't hold it.  I don't know it's a sorrow and calm thing in my mother.  I find you.  I don't know it'scken than you.  I don't know where you're seeing eye.  We'll be right back. 
[02:29:00]  guitar solo 
[02:29:30]  That was a fun walkover today.  That was fun.  A lot of people.  Yep.  That always makes it fun. 
[02:30:00]  I couldn't figure out why there was a diverse crowd  and why there were a lot of people we've never seen before.  And why was that?  Because Jimmy's in town.  Jimmy's in the show.  So these people are flying from all over the country to see Jimmy.  That's pretty damn cool.  That's pretty cool.  Indiana.  I heard Florida.  Well, PA.  They drove from Pennsylvania.  Jimmy, most of those people are for you, you know.  Are they?  Yes.  I thought people were out there for Jeff.  I thought they wanted maybe a Jeff picture,  but then it turns out Jimmy Norton. 
[02:30:30]  Jimmy Norton.  By the way, you were talking about chatter teeth in that article?  Yeah.  Chatter.  Well, Brian and Tano.  Chatter teeth.  Always funny.  I'm going to try something different today.  No headphones.  Oh.  I'm going to try to save my ears.  Oh, wait.  Then I can't hear Brian.  Good luck.  Come on, Opie.  You got to hear.  Opie.  Opie.  That lasted long.  Opie.  I don't like it.  Brian, Toronto, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Got a question for Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, you seem to know Bob Sagan.  It's always driven me crazy.  When he did that one scene in Half Baked where he stood up and said, 
[02:31:00]  have you ever sucked cock for a pod or whatever?  Yes.  I used to suck cock for a pod.  Is Sagan a big smoker?  Does he smoke pot?  I don't, to my knowledge, he doesn't do anything.  He might, but I've never, I don't know him that well.  I think that moment in Half Baked is what began the perception change for Bob Sagan  because that was the line in the movie everybody remembered was Bob Sagan saying that.  I used to suck cock for cocaine or something.  Yeah, it floored me when I saw that for the first time because I had no clue Sagan was like that.  So, and my second question, Jimmy, is remember in the, you were talking about that reporter 
[02:31:30]  who's reporting on comedy, that dumb broad from Ohio?  Yes.  And you said, anybody who's got that Chatterteeth logo beside their thing, you know, is bullshit  or whatever.  Yeah.  And I just wanted to say that it's funny because on XM Radio, last time, that station, their  logo is that fucking Chatterteeth.  And it's funny because every time I turn that fucking station on, it's some Bill Cosby skit,  I turn it back to the replay of you guys because it's still funnier even though I heard it already  in the morning.  You know what, Jimmy, Jimmy is a bad boy today. 
[02:32:00]  Why?  He was happy that Viacom had a horrible quarter, even though we still technically worked for  Viacom.  Well.  He went after Subway.  And Tom Chiasano's trying to sign Subway.  Oh, did Tom get mad at him?  Yeah.  We could talk about this.  This is why you have the XM, by the way.  We give you the inside show after we leave the other joint.  We give you the poop.  And Tyson Walters just sent me, who's the cowboy I was talking about.  Yeah.  He's on the Redskins.  Is he mad at you?  Is he mad at you now?  I didn't know he was on Washington.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  He didn't, I guess he got cut.  You like it.  He got cut.  I was just teasing because I was saying this would happen to that.  I would still recognize you, sweetie.  This is the ex-cowboy, Tyson Walters.  But so you went after Subway and Tom Chiasano was not happy about that because he's trying  to sign Subway and he pretty much said that you're making his job a lot harder.  And then he said Chatter Teeth, if you're trying to do a comedy thing, is stupid.  And that's the big XM logo that they're very proud of in Washington.  The logo for one of the comedy channels.  For the comedy channel is the Chatter Teeth. 
[02:33:00]  You're batting a thousand today, my friend.  What's the matter?  Could they get the rights for the chaplain mustache and that funny thing?  Fucking Chatter Teeth.  Suck a fat dick.  What do you think of them apples?  It beats our logo, which isn't one.  It says virus.  Yeah.  We're just sick.  Chatter Teeth.  What kind of chili you got there?  They didn't have turkey again.  What do they got?  They had beef chili.  What do they got?  And I figured I'm going to treat myself. 
[02:33:30]  No more live reads.  Hey, can you do the dump report?  What's up, CSK?  CSK, do the dump report.  Yeah.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios.  Wow.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Did Bill cue that?  I didn't recognize him without his beard.  He shaved it all off.  Bill did not want to miss a cue today.  And then he nodded like, no, I did it right.  But it was a little premature, wasn't it?  It was a little premature, man.  It was a little premature.  You were like, and today we have a dump report. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  It's the dump report.  Now he's earnest eager.  No kidding.  His finger right now is over the butt, and it drips sweat like Cruz in Mission Impossible.  There's that one bead of sweat on the tip of Bill's finger.  Poor Bill.  Bill shaved.  The second you said, should we do the dump report or the dump report?  He's a panicky Pete.  Bill shaved.  Bill was last night probably wondering what happened, and he convinced himself that it  was the beard.  It was the beard that fucked him up. 
[02:34:30]  The beard.  I have to shave the beard.  Can I acknowledge something, by the way?  Yes.  When the fans come out for the walkover, it gives us a nice energy.  Yes, we like when you guys come.  Listen to the energy we got today.  Oh, my God.  Are some of them coming up, by the way?  Yeah.  Let's let a lot of them up.  The fact that it's Friday has nothing to do with it.  But let them come up.  We love when the fans come up.  You know what?  I say break out the keg today.  Why not?  We haven't done it in a while.  Get the keg, Kenny, and set it up right in the middle.  Kenny has something to say.  What?  No, the fans should be in by the end of the show after Poe's done with the paperwork with  all of them.  What happened?  Do we need paperwork for them at all?  No, they're not talking on the radio. 
[02:35:00]  They're not talking on the show.  There's no paperwork.  Let them come in.  No paperwork.  What is going on?  If someone decides they want to talk, then they got it.  Wait, wait.  Do they need to do paperwork?  If they come on air.  All right.  If they come on air.  How about this?  No paperwork unless they come on air.  If they come on air, they might have to do something.  Yeah, get them.  No, I don't want to do it again.  What is your name?  Driver's license number?  Have you ever been to FH Riley's?  Why do we need...  Do you know the parking lot around the back?  You know, No Filter Paul made a good campaign ad, Poe vs. Kenny. 
[02:35:30]  I know it's a week late, but it might be interesting if you wanted to hear it.  I heard about that.  I didn't hear it then.  Where is it?  Do we have it?  Steve's got it somewhere.  Steve's got it somewhere.  Steve obviously thought it was just as good.  He took it into his den, and he's going to listen to it while he hibernates.  All right, dump report.  Let's go.  All right, can anyone guess who's got this?  Live from the Opie and Anthony show studio.  Ah, fucking Bill.  Holy shit, Bill.  You are the best. 
[02:36:00]  I'm wow.  I'm glad you're not fucking charging nuclear weapons.  Oh my God.  Holy shit, imagine that.  Should we drop the clouds everywhere?  Where the only winning move is not to play the dump report?  Jesus, Bill.  Fucking panicky people.  I think we ought to have sanctions against the country.  That way, oh, the atom bombs are blowing up all over the place.  Jesus.  Oh, that is funny.  Who wants to guess who had the first dump of the day?  Why would they dump that?  I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm a little pissed off at that one.  I don't get a sheet to even look at anymore.  Oh, I do.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I'm wrong.  It was right next to you.  There is actually one dump here that is absolutely ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, let's start.  7.53 a.m.  Our own, the one and only, Opie.  Wouldn't it be more effective to call her a cunt?  Yeah.  Here's what I love in the report.  Al Dukes capitalized the C in cunt.  It really is a proper name. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, proper name.  Yeah, proper name.  Cunt.  I keep the XMers in mind when I do that other show.  That was one for the XMers today.  That's what I do.  Who cares if we get fired for it?  8.41 a.m.  I touched a female contestant internally.  Bob Saget.  Oh, internally.  Okay.  Dumped a line because he followed up with and gave her a pap smear.  Oh. 
[02:37:30]  Shmear.  It's not a pap smear.  You're not putting a fucking, some locks on it.  God bless you.  It's an old Hebrew gentleman.  A pap, with a little pap smear.  It's a smear.  God bless you.  Pap smear.  That is the worst knee.  I can't help it.  It's the dander.  Animal dander.  I sneeze when I am confronted with animal dander.  Dander.  Animal dander bothers my sinuses.  8.55 from McCallers. 
[02:38:00]  Sometimes there's a little hair on the pubis of a nine-year-old, which will cause me to sneeze  incessantly.  Is that dander?  No.  Go.  Are we almost done with the dump report?  8.55.  Live from the OBNB Radio studio.  The TV dump report.  8.55 a.m. from McCallers. 
[02:38:30]  A man's ass is being forced into another man's face.  That absolutely should not have been done.  No, that should be done.  That was not sexual.  It was just silly.  It was silly.  A man's ass being forced into another man's face.  It was about being pushed into another man's face.  It wasn't eating ass.  No.  It wasn't doing anything like that.  It was just pushing him back.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I mean, I do understand.  I mean, you have to read this stuff, I mean, because technically it is part of the dump  report.  Live from the OBNB Radio studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:39:00]  And then 8.56, the caller again, Benoit Balls dropping out of someone's ass.  That's understandable.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  I hope this chili doesn't make me have to take a dump.  Report?  No.  Stop.  It's not funny anymore.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but it would have been funny without the report and if he would have done it.  My God.  That would have been funny if you said take a... 
[02:39:30]  But he wasn't looking at me.  I know.  Why wasn't he looking at you?  I don't know.  Bill's going to have to...  We're going to have to...  Look, we've got to replace him.  He's got to be dumped.  Live from me at the Anthony Show Studios.  There he comes right back.  Daily Dump Report.  That's called a roaring comeback.  Thank you.  Travis is cueing him.  Smoothie, Anthony.  By the way, Travis right now is eyeing that pink hat I bought.  What?  It's not funny.  I have shoes that will go with that.  Of course he does.  All right, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to continue the show.  That's what we're going to do today. 
[02:40:00]  Yes, it's what we do.  And I have a whole thing I'm doing with these.  Almond's.  I was going to play Guess the Sound.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's my fault.  I blew it.  My fault.  We should have said Guess the Sound.  Speaking of Guess the Sound, we still don't know what this is.  I'm amazed.  I'm going to annoy you during the replay.  Listen to this part where I'm talking and eating.  I'm amazed that no one has gotten what this is yet.  Guess the Sound. 
[02:40:30]  Bill missing a cue.  No?  All right, trying to figure it out. 
[02:41:00]  There you go.  We'll take a break.  Do we have the unedited clip of the girl singing Sweet Home Alabama getting tased?  Oh, it's not even.  What?  What?  Sam?  Sam?  The original clip had the beep in it. 
[02:41:30]  So unless we can find a different clip.  Oh, okay.  The video's up on Break.com.  It's labeled Hot Chicks Get Tased.  What do you videotape with?  A camera?  A camera?  A camera.  A camera.  I bring in a camera.  Are you related?  Whenever Iraq comes in, I bring in a camera.  Are you related to Louis Anderson?  No.  Not a bit.  A camera.  I'm sure you had a similar upbringing.  My father used to beat me with a camera. 
[02:42:00]  I've learned to turn Caucasian into Negro.  All right.  We taking a break?  So I'm going to wash my hands and have some soup.  Yeah, let's.  I got to wash them.  Let's take a break.  Oh, so delicious.  Now getting your nails done could wind up doing a lot of damage.  How bad will the hurricane spill?  A popular medicine for children now linked to seven deaths.  A common medicine could be turning people into compulsive gamblers.  And is there a hidden danger in your bag of microwave popcorn?

[02:43:30]  We've got to make a video for Vegas.  What kind of video?  A video where...  One with a camera.  A camera.  I got my camera and we need a video for Vegas.  I'll tape it with a camera. 
[02:44:00]  Camera.  He says camera.  Camera.  It's cute.  All right, well...  Adorable.  Can you moon Vegas for us, maybe?  Well, it'll end with the moon.  I got a great body.  I'll show it off.  I don't give a shit, right?  All right, start rolling.  Get Steve in here.  We've got to make a video for Vegas.  I guess I'll do it.  I guess I'll...  Steve!  I'll do it. 
[02:44:30]  Someone needs...  What is this for?  That's why we're getting Steve.  Someone on Instant Feedback needs attention.  Derek C.  from Ohio.  Opie is an ignoring ass.  Ignoring and not mentioning that a serious radio and a Howard mention in the FHM magazine,  but no...  What?  But no XM radios.  There you go, Derek.  I read your feedback.  What were you expecting?  Wait, I don't get it even.  I don't even get it.  We've been feedbacking the same thing for two days.  I read your... 
[02:45:00]  Can you explain it then?  Because I don't understand it.  I'm an ignoring ass because I'm not mentioning that a serious radio and a Howard mention appears  in the FHM magazine, but no XM radio.  Yeah?  All right, Derek.  There you go.  What was supposed to happen?  I don't know.  Why didn't he call?  We don't know what you're talking about.  Is it because his chick is in there?  Yeah, who cares?  Is that why?  What was supposed to happen, Derek?  A mention?  Was it a commercial?  Was it an advertisement on a page in the thing?  What are you talking about?  What were you hoping would happen after I read your stupid instant feedback? 
[02:45:30]  Who cares?  Or was it a three-page article on this show and the comedians that join us?  Keep listening.  Thank you.  There you go, Derek.  Keep listening to our show.  Two days.  He's been sending the same...  Why aren't you listening to your hero?  Oh, that's right.  It's Friday.  All right, Steve.  What do we got?  We're shooting AF.  Yeah, let's go.  We're shooting a video for the Vegas affiliate.  Yeah.  Yeah, extreme...  What is it?  Well, you should be rolling now because they could use this whole thing.  Yeah, she's going to be gold. 
[02:46:00]  All right, watch this.  Sure.  Watch this.  Take two.  Steve, why is there a video camera in the Opie and Anthony studio?  Well, Opie, it's funny you should ask because we're shooting a video for Extreme Radio...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  You can't even get it.  Oh, boy.  Can't you make it...  Oh, there it is.  Oh, there it is.  Can you at least make it sound like you know what the...  I was trying to.  I couldn't read it.  It's X107.5 in Las Vegas.  X107.5.  I didn't know that. 
[02:46:30]  You had to look on the freaking screen.  You didn't know either.  I knew.  I love...  X107.5.  Who didn't know?  Steve.  Steve didn't know.  Because Steve is a dolt.  I know all the...  Jimmy, why are you reading a She-Mail magazine?  This is our video.  What?  Why are you reading a She-Mail video?  We're...  We're...  The question is, why aren't you?  We're filming a video for...  The question is, fair enough, sir.  X107.5.  X107.5.  Yeah, they play...  They play... 
[02:47:00]  Extreme Rock.  Extreme Rock.  Everyone knows that.  Why don't you just say it?  You gotta read it off a goddamn screen.  All right, wise-ass.  What are we promoting?  We're promoting their holiday thing.  And what's the holiday thing called?  Christmas.  That's right.  What it's called.  It's called the Holiday Havoc 06.  You helped us.  I didn't.  He helped us.  I didn't see anything.  Nothing.  I just know because I know it's a big thing. 
[02:47:30]  And it's really cool.  And what bands are playing?  Deptones, Papa Rhodes, Celine Dion.  No, not Celine Dion.  Yanni.  Yanni will not be there.  Lost Prophets.  Oh, my God.  Who else?  Geez.  Willie Nelson.  Willie Nelson.  Yeah.  No.  He's coming up soon.  Wow.  Jimmy?  What?  What are you doing?  He's reading.  I'm reading.  He's thumbing through a periodical.  They play extreme rock. 
[02:48:00]  I like extreme girls.  Yeah, so extreme.  They're not even girls anymore.  They certainly are.  They're girls with extra surprises.  Stop being so judgmental.  All right.  Listen, why don't we end our video with something very special?  Unwritten law.  Another band just popped into my head that I know is going to be there.  Uh, it's going to be great.  We're going to be there.  Yeah.  This magazine stinks.  They're here.  Oh, they're here.  See?  We're on the big screen here.  Is this on the big screen? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Ah, fuck.  Uh, Jimmy, why don't you end the video in Opie and Anthony style?  This is for Vegas.  Vegas!  Yeah.  We're really happy to be a part of your big concert.  Rock on.  Wait, can we maybe get the logo on your ass?  All right.  Get Travis.  He'll write it.  Of course he will with his lipstick.  Let's have it.  You know how much I like you guys to allow this?  And you don't have to film this whole part with your camera.  My camera. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  I got a camera.  All right.  You got it right.  I don't want to do that.  You have to.  I've seen it well.  Do you have to have a fucking permanent marker?  How about getting some lipstick?  We can shoot this in five minutes.  Fucking permanent marker on my anus?  It's not permanent marker.  It's the stuff we use for the dry erase board.  Oh, that's great.  That's going to wash off my asshole later.  Get lipstick.  Hey, do one of you broads have lipstick I can sully with my anus?  How about we go buy some for $3 across the street?  Well, Phil, this is not being shot in real time, you homo. 
[02:49:30]  Put the camera down.  Is it going to be edited?  No, we got lipstick.  Here, it's coming in.  No, I don't want her lipstick.  I want wine.  It's going to be fine, Jimmy.  Wonderful.  Just lick it off before you use it.  Oh, that's nice.  All right.  I want ruby red, but apparently you want that color because it's winter.  All right, here we go.  Travis.  Travai.  Just write X107.5.  Extreme Rock Radio.  Holiday Havoc.  Please.  Please, God.  Please, God.  All of that?  I've never wanted. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Well, at least write X107.5.  And you have to put all our affiliates.  At least write X107.5.  Oh, please, God.  X on one cheek, 107.5 on the other.  You want both cheeks?  And then write Holiday Havoc and use his asshole for the O.  Or how about I write Holiday and I'll shit my pants if that could be the Havoc part.  All right, here we go.  Come on, my crack is clean, dude.  I showered last night.  I didn't take a drink yet.  All right, Travis is now writing X107.5 for the special video that Vegas needs from us. 
[02:50:30]  Could you just breathe into it a little?  No.  All right.  How are we doing?  Oh, there is the point.  The point must have felt good, Jimmy.  It certainly did.  I wish there were more call letters.  All right, Sam, focus in on Jimmy's ass with the call letters.  X107.5.  All right, there you go.  There's your stupid video.  Enjoy the show.  Thanks.  Now can a napkin.  Yeah, someone's now got to clean off Jimmy's ass. 
[02:51:00]  That's right.  No, no, no.  Lick it like my mother would if I spilled something.  Lick it.  Like a lot of times I would get stuff in the corner of my mouth and mother would lick the  napkin, which was disgusting.  Yeah, that is really rude.  Could you get me a, how about some water and I'll wash it off myself?  Look at Jimmy's appendix scar.  Yeah.  Can you give me some water?  They burst out.  No, what's right there?  My appendix scar.  That's his cock.  It burst?  My appendix burst when I was seven.  When you were seven?  I should be dead.  You poor little lad.  It's very rare they burst. 
[02:51:30]  Usually they swell up.  But my birth, they had to go in and get them behind me and shit.  Didn't it hurt?  Like, I was, yeah, I'm a god.  No, I mean before it burst.  Turn the video camera back on.  This should be, this should be shown to all potential interns.  All right, here we go.  This is, this is Craig now wiping off the lipstick from Jimmy's ass.  That's right.  Jimmy, I must say you have a sweet ass.  Thank you.  But I don't like the fact there's cold water.  That's two demerits.  Next time get warm.  Ooh.  How great would it be if I could just...  Do some of this.  Oh.  No.  I don't want seltzer. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, that'll work.  Thank you.  I don't want it anywhere near where I'm going to be drinking.  Wait, excuse me.  Could you squeeze that out before you drip it into my underpants?  I'm going to have lipstick and seltzer and go home.  My girlfriend's going to wonder who was eating my asshole.  Jesus, dude.  These are both mouth things.  Throw some Lavoris on it.  Did I really say, hey, oh, can you ask Jimmy if he could teach me how to read a video  like you said he was doing? 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  I'm tightening my butt.  I said that, huh?  I don't want this boy to tell people I have soft, unshapely butt.  Oh, my God.  Kenny's a little boy.  He just saw Jimmy's ass.  Poor Club Soda Kenny.  That's just a hiney.  Young lad.  Look, he's laughing at your ass.  He has no idea what's going on.  He's cracking up at your ass.  And another man wiping it off.  Please.  Can we introduce Club Soda Kenny to Vegas?  Hey, Vegas, this is Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny, say hi to Vegas.  Turn around.  And we're on video. 
[02:53:00]  Kenny?  Hi.  Kenny?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Could you please get my smoothie away from Jimmy's ass as quickly as possible?  No, because you're going to fart.  I can't fart.  I tried so hard.  It would have been really good if you could have farted.  I ran on Travis.  Thank you, Kenny.  I wish you would have sprayed diarrhea into Craig's face as he's wiping that off.  Yeah.  A lot more to clean up.  You think I wouldn't have loved that?  I would have actually sacrificed these pants and sneakers and just shit violently.  Oh, would that have been great?  I would have taken the lawsuit and shit violently for the laugh it would have gotten. 
[02:53:30]  Kenny?  Yes, sir?  Tell the people thanks for listening to the show and enjoy the rest of Holiday Havoc on  107.5 Extreme Radio.  Yeah, thanks for listening.  Thanks for listening to the show and thanks for listening to Havoc on 107.5 Radio.  And please, if anybody else is going to wipe Jimmy's ass, could I please be considered?  Yes, you can.  All right.  All right, Vegas.  We're finally saying goodbye.  Enjoy the show. 
[02:54:00]  You get the best smoothies, Ken.  That one yesterday was like drinking sewage out of a cunt, but this is nice.  Excuse my French.  All right, let's move on here.  Yeah, I wish you could have gotten one of these out, Jimmy, when he was doing that.  I gassed on the elevator.  I got a fucking good one out and I blamed it on stupid Sam.  Yes, you did.  It was like, oh my dude.  Egg whites?  I didn't do it.  Thanks, he's holding my camera.  It was a sound made by the camera. 
[02:54:30]  And good vegetables.  I like these vegetables.  Where'd you get the veggies, Ope?  I'm not saying.  All right, let's get into some more radio.  Oh, we got MSNBC coming in today, too.  Oh, we do.  Doing a little B-roll.  Are they going to be filming the same type of stuff that was just taped?  I'm hoping.  I'm hoping.  Okay, what we got here is a local news show playing uncensored Goodfellas clip by mistake. 
[02:55:00]  Oops.  This is really good.  Oops.  Wait, a news show?  News show.  So I guess they're doing something that has something to do with the Goodfellas.  I haven't heard of it.  I heard yesterday that apparently the FCC has lightened up on the news.  Right.  And them cursing on the air.  Maybe they were testing out the FCC.  Maybe they were.  Here's the clip.  One of the best ones out there right now is Martin Scorsese's The Departed.  To ride on the popularity of that, the Gene Siskel Film Center right now is putting on a series called The Essential Scorsese,  a 10-film retrospective with highlights of the career of this American film genius, including this one. 
[02:55:30]  I'm funny how?  I mean, funny like I'm a clown.  I amuse you.  I make you laugh.  I'm here to fucking amuse you.  Goodfellas is one of the...  Wait, what?  There it was.  You're gonna fucking amuse you?  Goodfellas.  They cut it off immediately.  I make you laugh.  I'm here to fucking amuse you.  Goodfellas is one of the films that will play.  Cape Fear is another one. 
[02:56:00]  And Raging Bull.  Imagine that's not the only thing raging right at this moment.  For the exact time, see SiskelFilmCenter.org.  The Essential Scorsese runs through November the 1st.  And I have a meeting right now.  Yeah, I think the boss is here.  Here you go.  Here's the red phone.  Larry's used to taking this, Dean.  So you just go on and take that.  We apologize to the viewers for the censor with the slippery fingers.  Did not get that one.  Blame it on the censor.  Thanks, Dean.  There's no censor. 
[02:56:30]  There's no censor.  These news people are all aware of YouTube, by the way, and its popularity.  Because I was doing something with Joe Scarborough last night on MSNBC, Scarborough Country.  Yep.  Just filmed all sorts of stuff down there.  And they're like, yeah, most of the stuff we're not going to be able to use.  But we'll definitely get it up on YouTube.  End up on YouTube.  I sat in Imus' seat, and I farted into his mic.  Oh, is that fireable?  And then the mic farted into Imus' mic. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, and then the mic fell on the floor.  Who knows what they're going to use.  I think they're going to give us all the raw footage today, and then we can throw it up on our websites.  But then I was directing a segment.  Remember the bit?  It's not even really a bit.  One morning, I just started thinking about how I've only done really one thing in my life, and that's radio.  And I wanted, like, maybe see if I'm good at something else.  You never really had any other job.  And we weren't really sure if we were going to develop that bit.  But MSNBC, they liked it.  They liked the idea. 
[02:57:30]  And they said, well, why don't you work at MSNBC for a day?  So I went there yesterday and just, you know, fucked around the halls.  And they just had a camera on me the whole time.  And who knows what they're going to make out of it.  But I'm directing a segment, and Joe Scarborough was talking to President Bush's sister.  And I found which, like, knob I could push down to talk to Joe Scarborough while he was interviewing, you know, Bush's sister.  He's got his little earphones.  Yeah, and I was just completely fucking with him.  And everyone in the room thought it was hilarious because I'm actually doing it while they're taping the piece. 
[02:58:00]  I don't care.  And Joe Scarborough, he has a really good sense of humor.  And he's a professional.  He was talking about cocaine and all sorts of crap.  This guy's crazy.  As shit's just, like, going in his ear from you, he's conducting an interview.  Yeah, absolutely.  Wow, that's pretty good.  And I was really fucking around with him.  I'm going, Joe, make believe you care about what she's saying.  Ask her if she bakes cookies.  I was just doing, like, pretty much hacky stuff, you know?  You know, look more into it. 
[02:58:30]  All sorts of dumb shit.  And then I go, how do I talk to President Bush's sister?  And I was trying to figure it out because they didn't tell me which one it was.  And I was going to start talking into her ear as she was being interviewed by Joe Scarborough.  Yeah, that wouldn't have been good.  And that's when I pushed it to the limit where the whole room jumped up and said, no, and ran over to where I was.  All of a sudden, the bit wasn't funny anymore.  It went into a panic because they knew I would do it.  And then the phone rang in the booth. 
[02:59:00]  And I answered it because I'm in the seat.  I go, hello.  And all of a sudden, this lady goes, TJ, what the hell's going on in there?  Please tell me that this is not going to be a regular thing or something like that.  I go, I'm sorry.  No, it won't be.  Stick in the mud.  I said something like we're in the middle of taping this.  And she thought I was TJ.  And she goes, well, call me on my cell phone when you're done.  She just said, okay, I don't have your number.  Could you give that to me again?  And that we could have called her all day and all night. 
[02:59:30]  Well, it was TJ's boss who was sitting next to me who's a huge fan of the show.  He went white.  He goes, that's my boss.  What did she say?  I go, well, she's not really happy, man.  Turns out she was driving home.  And I guess there's a phone number she could call and listen to what's going on in the director's booth there.  Wow.  At any given moment.  Do you think every show has that?  I don't know.  Because to get those numbers, how cool would that be, right?  Play those on the air every day.  Oh, man.  In the old days, when we were at AF, we knew the GM could call a phone number and listen 
[03:00:00]  to what we were saying on mic when the mics were off.  He could hear the whole room.  And we got the number one day.  Remember?  Oh, that's right.  We did get the number.  We were listening to Rocco.  Yeah, yeah.  Just babbling about shit.  Yeah.  Bruds and cocaine and stuff.  Dude.  You could punch in this number, call, and over the phone, all the mics off, totally shut off.  So you're just fucking bullshit.  It's not on the air.  And over the phone, you could hear everything that was being said. 
[03:00:30]  And there was never a sign or a light or anything that would go on in that studio letting you  know that the boss could do this at any time.  Wait a minute.  First of all...  No one even knew the boss could do it.  A couple of questions.  Yeah.  Can they do that here at XM?  Absolutely.  I'm sure the technology's there.  We know that.  It was there 10 years ago.  So it's probably even easier.  There's no doubt in my mind.  No doubt.  Do you think they've been doing it?  Probably.  At some point.  Yeah, probably because it's a curious factor.  How it can be used against you?  I don't know. 
[03:01:00]  It seems pretty illegal.  How about it in personal life?  Can you use it in personal life?  What do you mean?  Oh, you know what I mean.  How often do you have a fucking radio station set up at home where you can phone in to listen  to open microphones?  Why do you need a radio station?  Can't you dial your own number or something?  You could do a phone.  You could actually have a telephone where you call that phone a certain number.  The phone never rings, but you hear everything that's going on in the room.  Oh.  Wow.  We got TJ.  Burp, burp, burp, burp.  Okay. 
[03:01:30]  TJ.  OB.  So what's going on?  Dude, they called me this morning, bro.  I'm out.  No.  Yeah.  Fired, bro.  No.  Stop it.  No.  Stop it.  You know, you wanted to talk to Bush and they got pissed.  Yeah, see?  Now he's lying.  No.  You almost had us.  No.  I'm going to bust your chops.  Oh, are you?  We believed it.  Nice.  That would have been kind of cool, though.  Did you guys check out the footage yet? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, it looks great.  You'll be getting it today.  Oh, really?  So we can throw it on the website?  Absolutely.  Are you going to be able to make anything out of it?  Yeah, it's going to look great.  Yeah?  You in the control room, you in the makeup chair, you didn't talk about that.  You're telling how you got your hair done.  My hair did.  Got my her did.  I looked at Joe Scarborough and I told the makeup lady, make sure I don't look like that.  Jeez.  They poofed your hair up.  They did poof my hair up.  No, Joe is really cool.  He's crazy, man, behind the scenes. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, he's a good guy.  He's down to earth.  He's, you know.  And they're coming in to do B-roll today?  Yeah, absolutely, yeah.  I think they're going to be here any minute.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, you're getting a little nervous.  He was hitting on Lindsey there.  Yeah, Joe.  Was he after you checked?  Joe who?  Joe Scarborough.  He hit on Lindsey, then he was hitting on me.  And then he.  You've got to love Joe.  Anything with a hole, he likes.  Male, female, old and young.  I'll fuck it all.  Joe doesn't discriminate. 
[03:03:00]  Let's talk about cocaine.  He's hitting on my chick, then he's hitting on me.  And then, like, late in the day, he goes, I bet you're wondering if I'm bisexual or not.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  Me, you, Lindsey, Betsy.  Yeah, exactly.  Pat O'Brien.  He's nuts.  And he says he's a.  We gave him some stuff for you yesterday.  I don't know if he used it.  Oh, shit.  How did the footage of me farting into his mic come out?  No, it came out great.  And then the mic falling on the floor. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if that's going to go over well.  Why?  Well, he's particular about that stuff.  We fixed it, though.  We fixed it.  It's just like if one of his kids did that.  He considers Opia's son.  We never put his chair back in his office.  You know what they had to do at MSNBC for the Imus bit?  What?  They had to get his chair.  Turns out he doesn't want anyone else sitting in his chair or anyone touching his chair.  So after the broadcast, they have to take his chair away and, like, lock it in a closet somewhere. 
[03:04:00]  So they had to find the key to the closet to get his chair.  Imus is crazy about his chair.  Oh, so, you know, when he sees that, he's going to really be out of his mind.  Oh, no.  But it came out all right, TJ.  Yeah, it looks great.  I can't wait to put it on the air.  I don't know what day next week.  Tuesday, Wednesday.  I don't know what they decided, but, yeah, it's going to be great.  Well, let us know so we can promote.  Yeah, absolutely.  And Joe was cool with everything?  Yeah, he loved it.  He had a lot of fun.  All right, good.  All right, TJ.  Cool.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, bro.  All righty.  Let's say hi to Jim in Atlanta. 
[03:04:30]  Jim, what's up?  Not much, guys.  How you doing?  You know, you were talking about the whole talkback thing with the Scarborough Report where you hear, you know, they're listening in and the PD comes in and they're listening in the back.  Very, very common.  Every TV station, especially TV news, has a thing called a phone coupler.  And that basically allows anybody to dial into that number and just listen in, you know, call a listen line.  And it's basically they get a feed of IFB, you know. 
[03:05:00]  And you might remember that from, like, the live music stuff that you used to do.  Right.  Where, you know, you can send a channel back out and not just come in.  And it allows everybody to listen and talk back and forth.  But that's very, very common.  So, yeah.  And they could be listening to you guys all the time when you're, you know, in the background.  Good.  What if you unplug the phone?  Like, say I wanted to have it, but then I unplug the phone.  They couldn't call it if the phone's unplugged, right?  No, it's not through the phone.  Like, the phone won't ring. 
[03:05:30]  It's a special line in a little box that's located somewhere else and doesn't even look like a phone.  And then it dials in and you can hear every single microphone that's open.  But it doesn't look like a phone.  No.  It could listen to the room.  It's a piece of machinery, yeah.  But you could unplug that and they can't call in.  Yeah.  We found out where it was.  It was in a closet.  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  And we used to unplug it.  Yeah, we did.  We used to unplug it before I shift and then plug it back in.  Because we hated everybody. 
[03:06:00]  We were really mouthing off.  Oh, man, were we?  Oh, chatty Cathy's about everybody.  All right.  I don't want to eat in front of everyone, so we're going to take another break.  And then Tom Poppins is joining the program.  Where's Tom?  He's right there.  Where?  Where the fuck is he?  Right over there, Jimmy.  Seriously.  Seriously.  You're kidding, right, Jimmy?  No.  In the back.  Right over there.  I'm looking. 
[03:06:30]  I don't fucking see Tom Popp.  I would recognize him.  His head is as large as Steve Dahl's in that poster.  Actual size, I mean.  All right.  And by the way, I want to praise Walmart when we come back.  All right, we'll do that.  Now getting your nails done, you wind up doing a lot of damage.  How bad will the hurricanes feel?  A popular medicine for children now linked to seven deaths.  A common medicine could be turning people into compulsive gamblers.  And is there a hidden danger in your bag of microwave popcorn? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, stop it.  Are your local reporters trying to scare you to death?  The Opie and Anthony Show wants to hear scary news teases from your town.  Send your audio to danny at foundrymusic.com.  That's danny at foundrymusic.com.  A real ending!  A real ending!  A real ending!  A real ending! 
[03:07:30]  What was that, a two-minute break?  I know. 
[03:08:00]  I'm so chewing my apple.  Well, it's not like it's FM radio.  Look at the long breaks.  Tom Papa.  There he is.  Right out there.  I'm out looking.  I hear...  Shame me once.  Wait, fuck.  Yeah.  Shame me once.  Wait, that wasn't Freudian.  That wasn't a fucking Freudian.  Boom it twice, won't get fooled again. 
[03:08:30]  All right, we've got to get MS and...  MSNBC.  They're here with the camera to roll what they call B-roll.  Here's what we've got to do from now on.  Let me let people in on the insides of television news business.  The B-roll.  That's just what they cut to.  In between stuff that they have taped that's important, they throw in things like, now in  the radio business, you will see things like, they're called the VU meters on the board, 
[03:09:00]  which we don't have here, but they'll put them in anyway.  Those are those meters, you'll hear us talking, hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show, and you'll  see the meters go, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, to us talking, you know, and then  they'll tape the on-air light outside the studio where it says on-air.  It's very important.  Fucking awful.  And then they'll do like a quick twisting zoom in on the virus sign. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  Something like that.  Yeah, it's got to look all fast and a lot of action.  And they'll always have someone talking to a caller.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie and Anthony, spread the virus.  Opie and Anthony, a radio program, and then the voiceover starts.  While you guys talk in the background.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Excuse me.  Yes?  This is my piece.  I sure is.  It's a nice one, too.  You guys are just like the curtains. 
[03:10:00]  You're in the background.  Oh.  I'm the star of this piece.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah, I had my piece, too.  It was called The David Letterman Show.  Yes, it was.  That's why I'm getting you back.  Hey, I remember you from yesterday.  Oh, I have that camera.  Do you really?  Yeah.  That actual camera?  Mm-hmm.  It's the Canon.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's a good one.  The white screen.  Wait a minute.  I have a question.  Is that the old one or the new one?  The new one.  New one?  Were you kidding or are you serious?  I have that camera.  I thought you were joking.  It's not high def?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:10:30]  Yours is better?  Piece of shit.  Yours is a better camera than that?  Nah, mine's the same one.  Yeah?  I don't have the new one either.  Anthony, why would you have such a good one?  All right, what are we doing here?  Because I...  I take pornography in my off hours.  I know he does.  No.  He likes that camera because it shows the freckles on the youngsters.  Anamorphic white screen, right?  Yeah.  Hey, you know what I was reading?  You know what I was reading recently?  High def is a girl.  High def is wrecking porn.  Because it looks real bad. 
[03:11:00]  Because everyone looks bad.  You see all the scars from the lipo and...  Stretch marks.  Stretch marks and the pimples on the ass and all that stuff.  They say that high def is really, really not good for porn.  I love it.  You love the high def porn?  I love high def and everything.  You like all the scars and stuff?  Yeah, because that's what I see in real life.  Show it what it is.  I don't need a...  I hate that perfect airbrush shit.  Show me a disaster.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  I like that too.  As long as there's no fucking roids.  I can't take hemorrhoids. 
[03:11:30]  No, you gotta have a clean one.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I like a dark brown asshole too.  Do you?  I like it to be a good brown texture.  Where do you like the color change to start?  Way outside?  Yeah.  Like at the hips?  On the hips.  Yeah.  Exactly.  No, no.  I really do.  Not from being dirty.  I mean, it has to be clean for real.  I like it clean.  It's like skin discoloration around that area.  I like a deep, dark asshole.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  Deep dark.  What are you going, splunking?  I want...  When I'm eating ass, I want Oompa Loompas to peek out at me.  I want to see fucking brown heads with green hair rhyming while I'm tongue-ing your 
[03:12:00]  ghoulie.  You're horrifying our studio audience, Jimmy.  That is awful.  You're getting a lot of laughs, but you're also getting some horrified faces out there.  It should be on a woman, it should be the same tone all the way until, of course, you  get to guts.  No, it shouldn't be.  But why brown?  Dude, if she's...  It's like a man's asshole.  No.  That's the...  Oh, wait.  No.  I like a deep woman's...  I like when you open the cheeks and there's a huge crevasse. 
[03:12:30]  I like a deep, dark asshole.  I swear.  And fucking...  You don't have to swear to me.  I'm believing you 100%.  It's so annoying in porn.  They always...  They bleach it now.  It's like, do you not...  I like dark areolas on nipples.  Or big pink ones.  I like big pink cone titties like Tracy Lord's had in 84.  I love that shit, man.  She was 15 at the time, Jimmy.  Oh, all right.  So, 81.  I like...  I like... 
[03:13:00]  I like...  It would be funny if I said, all right, 74.  Of course I didn't.  Of course you have your...  It was still funny.  Have your morals.  No, I like a deep, dark asshole.  It's really sexy, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know why I like it.  All right.  It is a little odd.  Hey, we were talking about B-roll.  We got T-Bone on the line.  T-Bone.  Me and my buddies were just talking about this.  Down here in Florida, during every hurricane season, they do the worst fucking B-roll.  They show the stupid stop sign shaking back and forth every time. 
[03:13:30]  It's fucking awful.  Yeah, that's B-roll.  But the stop sign is going tic-tic-tic-to back and forth.  I mean, you pan down and Michael J. Fox is leaning against it.  Show's coming down to this.  We're talking about our favorite B-rolls.  Unbelievable.  Dark assholes and Michael J. Fox jokes.  Next on MSNBC.  Where are they going to go?  M&S.  M&S.  M&S.  M&S.  M&S.  M&S.  M&S.  That's right.  Multiple sclerosis on NBC.  They're a mess.  Yes.  They're doing a charity event. 
[03:14:00]  We'll straighten our backs.  All right.  What kind of B-roll do you need?  Yeah.  Anything you need.  Anything they ask you to make sure you've got...  You need like the on-air light on the air?  There you go.  On the air.  Yeah.  There it is.  Yeah.  And it's got to tilt a little bit.  You know what we've got to do?  Next time cameras come in, we have to hang signs over everything that they would film.  Yeah.  Let's say pussy lips on them.  Or cunt face.  That's horrible words.  Every on-air light has cunt face written on it.  Go ahead.  Or a picture of a cock.  A rinpley.  Go with that. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  You got enough.  Split.  No.  He needs the board.  He needs the phone.  What's going on on the computer, maybe.  There you go.  You got a little of that.  Hey, by the way, I had Fan grab some Tom Likas video before.  Is there any good audio on that?  That fat, funny asshole?  There isn't.  Why would there be?  No, but I mean like just typical fat guy Tom Likas audio.  His head is getting awfully large.  He's horrible.  He's horrible.  But I hear he's got a nice brown asshole.  I'm sure he does.  Settling on his nose.  Some Loatian boy.  He hires Loatian boys to put their assholes on his nose while he thinks of his next topic. 
[03:15:00]  I don't really talk like this, but I'll eat your asshole.  Come here, little fella.  Or Laotian.  No, I don't like that.  You always get yelled at for that one.  I know I do, but I don't care.  Why?  Because I'm not dommer, and I don't rape and strangle them when they're 14.  How the fuck would I know?  Whatever they are.  Little sexy things.  Rill into their heads.  You know what MSNBC should use as B-rolls?  Because it'll make us all laugh, because we know what we were talking about.  Yeah.  You know, obviously the sound will be down, but how funny would that be?  I know, because they can't put the sound up on this. 
[03:15:30]  No, it would be impossible.  It'll be an Anthony show, and Jim Norton.  The video playing of us talking about brown assholes.  Most of what they were saying, we can't even play.  Okay.  Here's a couple of things.  Was, uh, if.  We're talking about brown assholes like Panda Patrice.  All right.  Let's say hi to...  Phone call.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ranson in Colorado.  Ranson, what's up?  Hey, I'm a truck driver.  I'm out here on the road. 
[03:16:00]  But I got a guest for that noise or that sound.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  We've been playing guest of sound all morning.  So far, no one has gotten it.  It's, uh, it's what there, Ranson?  I think it's the, uh, two sumo wrestlers with the, uh, whistle going, uh, to stop and make it go.  Smooth delivery.  Oh, wow.  Oh, uh, uh, ooh, okay.  That's your guess?  Yeah.  Wrong!  Ah.  Thanks for nothing.  Still trying to figure out what this is. 
[03:16:30]  Jimmy has a guess?  Yes.  All right.  It's a Steve C. acting clip.  He's playing a whispering Frenchman.  Thank you.  What's my fucking problem? 
[03:17:00]  You're wearing my fucking kimono.  How did your mama's son die?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  So we're trying to figure out what that is.  Nah, just stay inside.  I'll surrender.  Stay by the walk.  I'll handle this.  All right.  Someone will get it eventually.  We love you, Steve.  Come on. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  How could you not?  Didn't someone already guess Japanese version of Yo Mama?  Yes.  That's not it either.  We've had lots of guesses.  No one's close.  All right.  Tom Pop is here.  Is he?  I think you're lying again.  No, there he is.  Hey, Phil.  There he is.  Tom Pop.  How you doing?  Hi, sweetie.  Sir.  Can we come say hello?  Sure.  How are you?  Still wearing the Yankee hat. 
[03:18:30]  That's brave.  That's nice.  A brave move.  How's it going, man?  What's up, bro?  That's nice.  A lot of people giving up on the team.  Hell no.  Those people.  Like Jimmy Norton.  You didn't give up, did you?  Jimmy's totally giving up on the Yankees.  Personal reasons.  Not even professional sporting reasons.  Nothing to do with the team.  Choking to the socks or screwing up in the playoffs.  It's personal.  He didn't get an autograph.  From who?  No.  He didn't get a picture signed.  Someone wouldn't take a picture with him?  No.  I found out.  No, no. 
[03:19:00]  Someone told me.  A little player named Derek Cheater.  Someone told me.  Young and up-and-coming player.  That Gary Sheffield betted a white woman.  A white woman?  The Rockettes.  He fucked all of them at once.  He shishkebobbed them.  That little rapist mustache of his.  You're surprised he had one white woman.  He doesn't have a rapist stache.  You're absolutely right.  He does that little snidely whiplash.  It's that Puerto Rican day laborer mustache. 
[03:19:30]  Whenever I saw him come to bat, I just pictured him at home in his silk leather leopard kind of silk robe.  You know, at home.  And everything's kind of jumbled up around.  And he's just got some white girl on the thing, kind of half-retarded.  Half-thousand.  Half-thruits.  I love Papa.  He's the cleanest comic on earth.  And he's here 30 seconds.  He does a rape joke.  I do not love this.  Gotta love that.  Well, it's contagious.  Who runs?  No one.  No one.  Roland? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland.  Roland running something?  Stop it.  We're in Roland.  Now stop.  What's wrong with Roland?  Did he try to make it seem like he was in charge of anything?  Roland.  I never met the guy.  I just had a little sheet with his name on it saying go to 40 West 57.  By the way, don't hold back.  Say what you want to say right in front of his face.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I've been here since quarter to ten.  Oh, my God.  What time is it now?  Where were you?  Wow.  First, they sent me to the wrong building, the other building, which I knew because, you 
[03:20:30]  know, the show, I'm like, they don't walk this way.  No.  But I'm like, well, it's on the sheet, Roland's a kinder, so I go down there.  Where was he sent?  Then they say, they sent me to 40 West.  40 West.  They sent me to CBS, but I email the publicist this building.  You email someone a building?  No, the address.  Oh, the address to the building.  Is that an attachment?  I'm going to say, wow, that'd take a long time to download.  So then the one contact I have is Roland, so they go to the security, they say, well,  you've got to call, someone's got to bring you up.  Yeah, parents have thought they let you up.  Right, exactly. 
[03:21:00]  All the terrorists, so I call up on the cell phone, and, oh, Roland's not there.  I said, well, I'm supposed to be on the air.  Yeah.  Well, he'll give you a call back.  I'm sitting next to that giant statue outside of Nobu, that big Robert Kelly statue.  I'm waiting and waiting.  Ten minutes go by.  Nobody.  Roland finally calls me.  Where are you?  Where am I?  Where are you?  They called my office, and I think the intern answered the phone, so I was like,  I didn't know. 
[03:21:30]  Nobody conveyed that to me in my office.  He's a nice guy, but this is not a voice of authority.  No.  No.  He's not even the voice of a guy.  I was waiting for him, and he was down at the other building, and I tried to get him  to come up.  Roland's getting more comfortable on Mike.  I know he is.  He's in my office.  But, Roland, not only is Tom a comedian that we know, he's a personal friendline.  And why would you humiliate him?  I wouldn't.  Why was Tom not treated with respect and love?  Yeah, what happened?  It wasn't me as whoever, the intern. 
[03:22:00]  I mean, if they contacted me.  Wow, he's blaming an intern.  Oh, we.  How can you blame an intern?  Like the captain of the ship, blaming the cabin boy for sinking of the vessel.  You are.  It takes some responsibility.  If it was my fault, I would totally say it was my fault, but they didn't call me right  away.  You have to be fired.  Yeah.  You fire someone.  Use your authority.  Fire someone.  You're fired.  Fire.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm going to have to let me go.  But Roland would call and be like, I'm going to ask what?  I give you a raise. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened, Roland?  Tom is my friend, and he was supposed to be on this program, and he's here now.  But see, then after like 10 minutes, I got a call from the officer like, yeah, some  guy, Tom called Papa.  I was like, oh, you idiot.  What's the number?  Then I gave him the number, so I called him right away.  And?  And then he came right over.  And then?  Came right over.  He said, you're at the wrong building.  I said, well, what do you mean? 
[03:23:00]  Just walk down the street.  You'll find this.  It's up the road.  We have a building with a door on it.  Like it's the country.  It's up the road a spell.  It's New York City.  Two blocks is the crow flies.  You'll smell biscuits and a black man with scabs on his legs shitting his pants.  Like it right there.  That's pretty accurate.  That's good directions, actually.  What happened?  Look at their filming.  Oh, they're filming the on-the-air life.  Why are you twisting the camera?  Why are you doing that? 
[03:23:30]  Who is that guy?  Anytime at SMBC.  Getting B-roll for a segment.  You're right.  You will always get the on-air light with the twisting push shot into it.  They're on the air.  And then VU meters, which haven't been used in radio since Marconi.  But for some reason, as we talk, you need that.  Yeah, why not just use old World War II radar footage of two soldiers in black and white  turning these giant knobs.  Tuning in Tokyo.  Yes.  Literally turning in Tokyo. 
[03:24:00]  That old gag.  Use some of that B-roll.  All right.  Roland, get out.  Zyklon B-roll.  I would like to-  Come on.  It's a funny joke for Nazis.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  I like an apology to my friend.  I am very sorry.  Oh, it's all right.  It's not a big deal.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You deserve a really good apology, Tom Papa.  First time on the show and everything.  Yeah.  Now, be sincere here.  I am sorry that they gave you the wrong information.  And next time, I'll email you directly to give you the right information.  Yeah, you should have my cell number.  Yeah, I see.  And we should hang out. 
[03:24:30]  Hey.  All right.  It's just the worst.  Have you seen Tom perform?  No, I've never seen him.  He's very funny.  Yeah.  Some of the Seinfeld DVD comedian.  What'd you like about that DVD?  Seinfeld's comedy?  Now, Roland's good.  You don't understand how great this is yet, Tom.  Roland is the greatest.  You'll catch on, trust me.  He just.  The greatest radio personality ever.  I would listen to this all day.  No, I want to, because he does like the Seinfeld DVD. 
[03:25:00]  Don't bail him out.  Don't say anything.  I got you.  Just watch him fall apart.  I would like to know.  We don't think you're going to collapse like a shit camera.  I want to know really what you enjoy about the Seinfeld DVD.  Not just Seinfeld's comedy, but.  Yeah.  Where you see him, the DVD is like behind the scenes of him leading up to his stand-up  and him on the road telling stories.  Telling stories.  Wow. 
[03:25:30]  What kind of stories?  Just one story maybe that he told.  He liked the DVD so much.  Yeah, one story.  All right.  With him and Colin at Gotham,  where they started and then you see him walk on stage.  Yeah, where they started.  Seinfeld's been doing comedy since 1976  and Gotham opened, I think, in 96 or 97.  So for 20 years,  he languished in his own head and started at Gotham. 
[03:26:00]  Wow.  My favorite role in hand mannerism is when both hands go out like he's holding a fresh apple pie and smelling it.  Both hands go out like he's offering something up, yet he has nothing.  No, please, Lord, give me an idea.  Please, I need...  He's offering something and it's never what you're looking for.  No.  It's just shit.  It's a pile of shit in his hands.  And, Roland, I've seen, by the way,  I've seen people better explain bloody child's underpants in their pockets than you on that DVD. 
[03:26:30]  That was horrible.  Colin died.  Yeah, well, when Seinfeld and Colin at Gotham.  You can see, he gets the look in his eye like he knows he's out, but he's still talking.  Yeah, he's still talking.  He knows he's got nothing.  Am I?  Well, I had to throw in the towel.  Yeah, sorry, man.  You'll do better next time.  Captain Queeg did a better job of explaining the strawberries.  Missing strawberries and whipped cream.  Roland saw the Will Ferrell movie that's opening today, right? 
[03:27:00]  Strangers in Fiction, yeah.  Strangers in Fiction is getting great reviews.  Now, we've got an audience out there and they're going to be going to the movies this weekend.  Can we give Roland a microphone?  And I want Roland to sell the movie to these people outside.  We actually do have faith in you.  That ought to be easy.  You can do it.  All this fucking room needs is a lethal injection table with the way the people are looking in.  All right.  Doesn't this just look like a death chamber?  We have a lot.  We have like 30 people outside.  There should be a priest in here reading you right now. 
[03:27:30]  All right, Roland, I want you to stand right in front of everybody.  There's about 20 to 30 people out there.  Sam, get your camera.  Get the camera, Sam.  Sam, tape it on your camera.  I just said to Roland, do we have headphones for Roland?  And Roland pointed at his bare head and said no.  I thought you were wearing them.  These are just ears.  Sam, set it up, okay?  Wow.  Sam, we'll set up the bit.  Make sure he stands in front of everybody.  Right in front of the glass here.  There he goes. 
[03:28:00]  He's getting a wireless headphone or something.  Watch him fall apart.  He might pass out.  This is awesome.  Yeah, he's not the best at public speaking.  Oh, he's great.  Or private speaking.  Yeah, and he does speaking.  Go ahead, Sam.  Now, Sam, set him up.  What the hell is that?  Someone's cell phone.  Blackberries are going on.  Stupid Roland's Blackberry.  Oh, there it is.  It's Will Ferrell talking to him to shut his face.  Here's Roland explaining to 20 to 25 complete strangers what Stranger Than Fiction is all 
[03:28:30]  about in case they want to go to the movies this weekend.  Go ahead, Roland.  Emma Thompson is an author.  She writes books and stuff.  Will Ferrell is an IRS agent that people hate.  But as Emma Thompson starts writing her new book, she uses his name as a character but doesn't know he's a real person.  Dessa Hoffman's in it.  It has funny stuff.  It happens.  It has jokes. 
[03:29:00]  It has funny stuff.  It has jokes ensue and you'll laugh and then you go, I don't know.  I think that's what it says on the billboard.  Yeah.  It has some funny stuff happen.  Variety.  Jokes ensue.  Dustin Hoffman.  Roland, Roland, sell it.  Sell it.  Come on.  What's good about it?  Will Ferrell's funny and has a great...  Why is he funny?  Because he does jokes.  Does jokes. 
[03:29:30]  Does jokes.  Like Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson have good chemistry and then Maggie Gyllenhaal's in it.  She's a good actress.  And she does stuff in the movie.  I don't want to give it away.  Oh, please.  You don't want to give it away.  You haven't even acknowledged that there are people in it.  I don't want to give it away.  Jesus.  It comes out today.  I'll give this away.  Roland's been dead this entire synopsis. 
[03:30:00]  I don't think he could give it away if he wanted to.  No.  Hey, anyone have a question for Roland while he's out there?  Just shout your question.  They're just as nervous.  Yeah, they're stunned also.  They're frightened of him.  It's okay to ask a question.  No one has a question about...  Oh.  It appears to be to you.  Oh, for a minute.  What?  Hold on.  Can we get him a moment?  Yeah, we got it.  It may appear to be as exciting as you bringing it up to be.  Oh, it is.  It's a really good movie. 
[03:30:30]  I got to see it.  Yeah.  I really got to see it now.  Fandango.com.  There you go.  Fandango.com.  Everyone knows Fandango.com.  The way he just said it, I was like, what?  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandig.  What?  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  All right, Roland.  Roland is gold, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  We got a question.  What makes Maggie a good actress? 
[03:31:00]  Oh.  Oh, really?  She's funny.  What's funny?  Her and Will Ferrell have good chemistry, and you see their relationship built through the movie.  You know what good chemistry would be?  You and hydrochloric acid.  That's what I want to say.  Roland, by the way, you're attending the show tonight, right?  Yeah.  Roland will be bringing me on tonight.  Wow.  At the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Wow.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Here I am.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Ladies and gentlemen.  You will not be allowed to bring a paper out.  I will have a list of things for you to say.  Give it up.  And you will bring me on stage tonight.  You may have seen him on...  Thank you.  He'll fuck the name up.  You might have heard him on Bob and Tom.  Are you ready?  Jokes will ensue.  Here it's on David LaTotterman.  Please, Tom Papa.  Jay Leno.  Jay Leno.  Jay Leno.  He was on the Jay Leno Tonight Show.  Chemistry.  Any other questions out there?  Chemistry.  He's got good chemistry with himself and the microphone. 
[03:32:00]  I can hear him sweating.  Yeah.  It was really awful, wasn't it?  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  The faces he makes are priceless.  Oh, I wish it was TV.  He's like a sad basset hound.  Yeah.  Lenny wasn't this nervous after he fucking murdered Curly's wife in the barn.  Any other questions out there?  Anyone else?  That's it.  Wow.  You're going to let him off the hook?  They just want to look at him.  Oh, he's running away.  He just want running.  He's had it.  They won't even make eye contact with him. 
[03:32:30]  Well, at least he made me want to see that movie.  Absolutely.  I'm laughing already.  I mean, how do you know?  He puts it into words.  Jokes will ensue.  Jokes ensue.  Let's go to Dave on Long Island.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Dave.  I think I know what that sound clip is.  What?  Oh, the Japanese thing?  You think you do, do you?  All right.  I think I do.  I think it's a bunch of Japanese guys getting together for a game show and tasering each 
[03:33:00]  other in their testicles.  Testicle tasering.  Japanese testicle tasering.  That would be incorrect as well, sir.  I can't believe no one's getting this today.  I know it. 
[03:33:30]  Jimmy, you got it?  Yes.  It's what people do to enjoy life and forget that they've had nuclear weapons dropped on  them.  And that is exactly right, by the way.  This is, yeah.  That culture, Jimmy's brought up the pornography of Japan and Germany.  They just have gone so far overboard with their pornography.  And I guess it is just the mindset of a conquered nation, even though it's years later, that 
[03:34:00]  I think that things like this, this example, this sound we're hearing, just kind of, it  does kind of reflect the conquered nature of that nation.  What do you mean?  That they...  They can't quite get over it.  Right.  That they lost the war.  You know, we're a little screwed up because we kind of lost a couple of the small games,  you know, the Vietnam.  We had a couple of fun little grenades thrown in there that was fun and everything.  And then now Iraq, this is kind of a bad one. 
[03:34:30]  But, you know, all the majors, you know, when it's the big game, we step up.  We pull it out.  We pull it out.  If we got to drop nuclear bombs, we'll do it.  We've lost wars for political reasons.  We've never surrendered.  Even in Vietnam, we could have wiped the whole country off the map if we wanted to.  And everybody just decided to leave.  And so the porno gets a lot worse.  So the porno gets worse because they feel like they're humiliated.  So it's just like...  Right.  So they need to humiliate even more.  They need to watch someone being humiliated worse than they were humiliated.  They punish the genitals of each other.  Oh, absolutely. 
[03:35:00]  And for some reason, the Japanese love shit.  I don't understand it.  I don't get...  It does nothing for me.  It is horrendous to watch this over and over.  You've seen a lot of their porn?  Yes, I've seen it all.  I've seen it plenty of times.  I'm disgusted on numerous occasions.  It's because of sushi.  What?  Yeah, your shit doesn't smell as bad.  I never heard that.  It's soy shit.  Oh, really?  It's soy shit. 
[03:35:30]  It's like baby.  No, look it up.  I'm serious here.  Look it up.  Look it up.  There's just somebody in Japan once looked at a wedding dress and then took a shit and  thought, my God, how do you not combine these two things?  Yeah, put them together.  Put a girl in this special dress, open her mouth and dump into it.  They're filthy people.  And she's going to love it.  And make this little sound, by the way.  This is from that.  In the beginning, you could actually hear the sounds of it coming out.  It's a little, like, moist, crunchy sound. 
[03:36:00]  Listen.  Yes, like cornflakes.  Was she in the wedding dress or was he?  I think she was.  Yeah.  And she was just crying.  They love to cry.  They love crying women.  Yeah.  They love their women crying and submissive.  I don't get it.  And there was a thing about them selling dirty panties and vending machines on the streets.  I could see that.  Why?  I don't get it.  They're awful.  Well, we're still trying to figure out this sound.  I don't get it. 
[03:36:30]  I don't get it wrong with shit.  Yeah, I know, right?  Yeah.  No one.  We kind of threw people with that one. 
[03:37:00]  No one is getting it today.  No one.  By the way, that scene in Platoon was on last night.  We were seeing a hate killer plot.  My girlfriend walked in and she hates any violence.  Oh, wow.  And I'm like, just watch this.  And she said she watched it for two minutes and she couldn't watch it.  I wouldn't turn it off.  And she said, and I quote, would you turn this off, you selfish old piece of shit?  She called you a selfish old piece of shit.  Yeah.  She invented it.  And I said to her, she's 10 years younger than me.  And she said that. 
[03:37:30]  And I was like a little hurt and angry.  Of course you were.  And I'm like, you shouldn't talk that way to people you care about.  I was like a fucking woman.  Why can't a gentleman watch a buck-toothed, one-legged Vietnamese get his head smashed in  by a lunatic?  Exactly.  Vici!  Vici!  You got your feelings hurt.  Oh, I really did.  I want to watch a Vietnamese man's brains be bashed in, and all of a sudden she has  to call me to task.  Selfish old piece of shit.  And she meant it. 
[03:38:00]  That's what came out.  Of course she did.  It just shot out of her mouth that she felt kind of bad.  Wow.  That is bad, because that means when she's walking around every day, even when she loves  you, she's thinking old.  Yeah, that's how old.  Yeah, yeah.  You can, you know what?  You can stop being selfish.  You can stop being a piece of shit.  Right.  Well, sort of.  Yeah, you can correct that.  But, oh, you're old.  But you're old.  Called you old.  You selfish old piece of shit.  Wow.  That's not good.  That isn't good.  That's not something you heard your grandmother call your grandfather when you were over their 
[03:38:30]  house one day.  Or over his coffin.  That's where he committed suicide.  Jesus, you selfish old piece of shit.  Wow.  She doesn't like movies like that?  No, she can't take any violence.  Wow.  You two might have a problem there with watching movies.  But, dude, might have a problem.  You watch Clockwork Orange like it's cartoons.  Do you understand that selfish old and piece of shit are all things that she obviously has  thought recently.  Right.  And she strung them together in one angry moment. 
[03:39:00]  Blurt it out.  That's like saying, you know, you're fucking no job having cheating motherfuckers.  That's a bunch of things.  It doesn't just come out right then and there.  Those were put together in time, built like brick walls.  Those are separate annoyances.  Right.  That came out in one moment.  Yeah, they're in one instance.  All those times when you gave her shit and she didn't fire back.  Yeah.  In her head.  In her head, she was going, old piece of shit.  Old piece of shit.  Old piece of shit.  You know, this guy's a little old for me.  You're a little old, old man. 
[03:39:30]  What a piece of shit.  What a piece of shit.  And then another day, fucking selfish.  Fucking selfish.  And in that one moment, boom, the trifecta.  Yeah.  Selfish old piece of shit.  I didn't mean that.  I meant every word of it.  I told her later.  I was, again, out to dinner.  She apologized again.  She said, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  But we avoid eye contact.  I put my arm around her and she put the face on my shoulder because we both knew she meant it.  Oh.  It's like Tourette's.  It's just, the truth just blurted out. 
[03:40:00]  It blurted out and it was hurtful.  She put her head on your chest.  Did she point out a gray hair?  Hey, you know, you're getting a little gray here, Gramps.  I'm surprised you didn't pinch my tits and call me Miss.  I love you, Grandpa.  Wow, that is bad.  Oh, it's awful.  You like those movies.  What does she enjoy, movie-wise?  She has a weird taste, man.  I don't know.  She hasn't seen a lot of those movies.  She watched Cuckoo's Nest with me.  She did like that a lot.  Yeah.  I'm watching this show that she likes called The Alan Partridge Show. 
[03:40:30]  Does anybody know that from England?  The Alan Partridge Show.  It's a funny show from England, actually.  She has good.  She's very funny.  She has good comic taste.  Yeah, but as far as watching The Godfather or something like that, no.  She wouldn't watch it.  No, regular movie taste.  Good fellas.  Dribble.  Things like that.  Never seen it.  Practical magic.  No, she wouldn't like that either.  She's not like dumb twat-ish.  She's not like a kid.  You know what I mean?  She wouldn't watch that either.  There's a keeper, right?  Take that one to mom.  Mom, she's not dumb twat-ish.  Is that what you said when she put her head on you? 
[03:41:00]  You said, I'm sorry, honey.  That's all right, you selfish twat-ish.  You're not dumb twat-ish.  Maybe that's the problem.  She hates me, and that's my idea of a compliment.  God, you're not a dumb cunt.  Stop soft-soaping me.  Hey, we got more guesses for the sound, by the way.  Right?  Where did it go?  Okay, we got Fernando Walters from Westchester guessing the Japanese sound.  Can I guess, is it a vaginal queef passing through a sports whistle? 
[03:41:30]  Uh, no.  And then you got DJ in a light bulb from posthores.net.  It's a bunch of Jap frat boys bombing a rival frat's house with marshmallows dropped from their assholes.  That is wrong as well.  I think that's an American custom Opie.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Exclusive to Geneseo.  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  I blocked that one out.  Hey, at least you aren't found in pink panties and fairy wings in your own vomit. 
[03:42:00]  Thank God.  Hey, we got the video of the day.  You see the deer in the Walmart?  Is it a Walmart?  Yeah, I think so.  Did you see this video yet?  Ah, this is radio, not television.  No, but we've been watching TV all morning.  By the way.  I thought you were going to play it.  Walmart.  Congratulations to Walmart.  Yeah.  I wanted to praise him anyway.  For allowing deer Americans in their store.  Absolutely.  What are they doing now?  You can't consort with white girls, but you can shop there.  I couldn't do that.  Fucking poor, what was his kid's name? 
[03:42:30]  Emmett Tillis, he whistled at a girl.  Come on.  Walmart has told its employees that it's okay once again to greet shoppers by saying Merry  Christmas.  Oh, okay.  Instead of Happy Holidays.  That was all the rage last season.  Well, you know what it is.  Stupid Happy Holidays.  Like there's any Jews at Walmart anyway.  Yeah.  Jesus, that's a damn good point.  There's fucking three Jews that shop at Walmart.  Right.  Fucking Catholicly boycotted last year in the American Family Association, which is a little  annoying.  But I do like the fact that it's so politically correct to say Happy Holidays.  No one gives a fuck about... 
[03:43:00]  Look, I mean, Kwanzaa's great and Hanukkah's great.  Hanukkah?  No one is celebrating them with fun.  No one.  Not at Walmart.  No.  They got to glue together those sterno cans to make a menorah.  As good as we got heaps.  I've never seen one of you live before.  They don't care.  All right.  Here's the story.  But that's good.  I kind of like that.  And I think with this whole change sweeping the nation, the Democrats winning, a lot of 
[03:43:30]  people upset about it.  I'm not a Democrat.  I definitely lean more Republican.  But I like seeing this change because the Republicans have just stunk up the joint this  long.  And with that whole change happening, the Borat movie getting a lot of publicity and people  liking it and it being so politically incorrect, I'm hoping that this is just the beginning  of the pendulum swinging.  The politically incorrect shit is just out of hand and has to now kind of come back. 
[03:44:00]  People are laughing at politically incorrect jokes again.  And hopefully it's the beginning of it because it has really stunk the past few years.  It would make our life a lot easier.  It sure would.  All right.  Here's the dear story.  Like we've done anything different than we would if it was accepted.  It's really held you guys back.  Jesus Christ.  I would love to see you guys.  What's happening?  Is everybody being thrown out?  Bye, guys.  Our studio audience has to leave before the royalties leave the studio.  Wow.  Bye, everyone.  Are you coming tonight? 
[03:44:30]  Oh, lovely.  Jimmy's just trying to make time with girls.  No, she has a guy.  She's with a guy.  All right.  She should come see Tom Papa at Gotham Comedy Club.  Ah, very nice.  Thank you.  That's the way we do it around here.  That is.  Now we do it.  Let me plug.  Tom is actually a really, really funny comedian buddy of mine.  Tonight and tomorrow, he's there tonight at Gotham on 23rd between 7 and 8, 8.30,  10.30 p.m.  And then tomorrow night, 8, 10, and 11.45, Gotham's a really nice club, and he tours 
[03:45:00]  with Seinfeld, and I despise his friendship with Rob Zombie.  It really makes me jealous.  8, 10, and 11.45.  You're friends with Rob Zombie and Jerry Seinfeld?  That's a strange combo.  Yeah.  It's a little weird.  It is a little strange.  You know, I'm loved by all people.  Ah.  See?  And fucking Clint Eastwood.  That made me want to throw up.  Clint Eastwood's a biggie.  Clint Eastwood was the biggest.  It is.  I did a gig for Clint at his Mission Ranch in Carmel, and he'd see me somewhere else,  and then he...  A place must cost, what, $200,000, $300,000, right? 
[03:45:30]  What's that?  That his ranch?  His ranch?  Yeah, probably about...  Yeah, probably about $200,000.  $200,000.  $300,000?  Yeah, in Carmel on the ocean.  Perhaps a bit more than that.  Yeah, what's he got, a half acre?  And after the show was over, there was like a little restaurant on his property, and it  was closed.  So he's like, well, I'll get you something, we'll have him make you something, and he  takes me from the gig across this dark parking lot, just me and Clint Eastwood walking across  the parking lot, and I have like this stupid joke about sleeping, how when we sleep, like, 
[03:46:00]  we're disgusting.  If you ever see your pillow without its pillowcase, it looks like a bandage from the Civil War.  It's just like, you know, it's a silly joke, and we're walking there with Clint Eastwood  in the middle of the night, and Clint's just like, you know, I really like that pillow  joke.  I was like, that's it.  That's him laughing hysterically.  Right, exactly.  That's it, I'm done with show business.  And then he told you to man up and bite one.  Yes, sir. 
[03:46:30]  You got it.  That's pretty cool.  Damn jealous.  Yeah, no kidding.  He fucking flies private planes with Seinfeld.  Well, Papa's life is really good.  Yeah, I had to fall into that friendship.  He saw me at the clubs, like when he was first coming back to do stand-up, you know, and maybe  he was coming to all the clubs and kind of working on his new act.  And it was just one week where every club that he was showing up at, I was on stage.  It's just like one of those things.  And because I saw him walk in, I was like, I would just throw new material, because I 
[03:47:00]  didn't want him to think I had, like, you know, like I'm pulling a comedian.  Yeah, hey, look at me.  I got a bunch of stuff.  It was off the top of my head.  Yeah, yeah.  And I came off at one point, and he said, hey, you're really funny.  I was like, oh, really?  Thank you.  And Bob Kelly was behind you and said, thanks, thanks a lot.  He said, not you.  Not you.  Not you.  Not you.  I was there during that not you story.  The not you?  Yeah, I was right next to him.  I cannot.  Oh, were you really?  Yeah, I was on the stairs.  I can't picture that in my head enough.  So great.  Like, I want every nuance of that moment in my head, because it is such a perfect fucking 
[03:47:30]  boob moment.  What was so great about it was, it would happen every night.  Like, Jerry would go up on stage, then he would come off, and, you know, it was new,  and he would kind of, like, come off stage and go right up the stairs and go sit at the  table, at a separate table from all the other comics, because, you know, he was just  kind of hang with Colin or hang with whatever.  And then I kind of, like, snuck in, you know, and he started hanging with him.  So it was this kind of thing.  It was like, you know, everybody just standing there watching him walk up the stairs night 
[03:48:00]  after night.  So I could see where Robert was just, like, waiting for, like, one day maybe.  Of course, one day.  And then he's just kind of like, oh, okay.  Not you.  Not you.  Yeah, Seinfeld's talking to a guy behind him.  And the worst part of that is everybody has been in that situation in a low level.  Right.  Where somebody, either at school or down the street, says, hey, how you doing?  And you go, fine. 
[03:48:30]  And you realize you don't know the person.  They're talking to the person behind you, and they start the conversation.  You walk away like, oh, my God, I look like such a dick.  I answered the guy.  I wasn't by the...  But it's Seinfeld.  Yeah.  And you're, you know, a comic trying to make something of yourself.  You take his invite to go upstairs and hang out with him.  Right.  And he's talking to the guy behind you.  One of the biggest comics ever.  It's not like he's just a fucking one of us.  He's one of the biggest comics ever.  Those most successful sitcoms on television still runs. 
[03:49:00]  People watch it a thousand times and still laugh.  And there's Bobby.  And what's so bad about it is that, like, if it was just some other comic going up the  stairs and saying, hey, Robert, you want to come up?  He would think about it for a minute.  Right.  He'd be like, well, I never thought about eating with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Or maybe I'm busy.  But he answered so quickly, which showed that he's been waiting for it.  Just waiting for the moment.  And, hey, do you want to come up for...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to do a set, but I'll come up after...  Not you. 
[03:49:30]  Like, why would I invite you up?  Get out of the way.  I'm talking to somebody.  Oh, classic.  That's so great.  I'm obsessed with, I want us to interview Seinfeld and ask about that and see if he  remembers it.  He's real.  I like it.  There's no way he'll remember it.  He's so honest.  I told you, I saw him take a photo of the guy.  He didn't want to take it, but he did to be polite.  The guy went to put his arm around him and Jerry said, we don't need each other.  We don't need...  We don't know each other.  We don't need to touch.  He just is an honest fucking guy, man.  He's not rude, but he's not going to pretend to be something. 
[03:50:00]  You will always know where you'll stand with him at any given moment.  Yeah.  We met him outside that restaurant one day, some Italian place, and I guess the guy that  we were with knew who he was with.  They struck up a conversation, and then there was introductions.  You know, this is Jerry.  This is Opie and Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  And he just kind of looked at us with this look of, oh, disc jockeys, and kind of went  like, oh, yeah, I heard of you.  And that was it.  End of conversation. 
[03:50:30]  No more.  We got to remember.  Yeah.  We're thinking, we're going to sit at the same table together and everything.  Yeah, hey, maybe lunch with Jerry.  Why don't we all...  Like, his guy and our guy would go, why don't we get a table together?  All right.  Why don't we all just sit and chat?  Not you.  And he goes...  Yeah.  And you saw on his face, oh, disc jockey.  Well, you got to remember when he was coming up, I mean, that's when radio was really in  the shitter.  Oh, yeah.  So think about when he was, like, at our level, trying to do all these comedy clubs  and stuff.  And go, hey, hey, we got Jerry Seinfeld here. 
[03:51:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld.  Go down to his show.  We're giving out free painter caps.  Hey.  Wow.  Yeah, that was radio's time that was equivalent to the brick wall comedy time where everyone  was a comic.  Yeah, exactly.  And there were 18,000 comedy shows on every Friday and Saturday night.  Yeah, the same way as comics.  The same way as comics, you were like, you don't want to do anything like those comics  used to.  Like, you would never wear, like, a skinny tie.  Right. 
[03:51:30]  Or Capizios.  Spenders.  Right.  Well, I have a sports jacket and jeans I wear and, like, a funny, like, wacky Hawaiian shirt.  Why wouldn't you?  I wear a suit jacket and sneakers.  Selfish old piece of shit.  That's actually on my bio.  I'm going to list all my credits and then say, but when all is said and done, he's a  selfish old piece of shit.  I wish I could name my sitcom.  That's brutal.  I love that.  Old is brutal.  That's a tough one. 
[03:52:00]  I thought piece of shit was worth.  No coming back.  Self, any of those things.  Piece of shit's not bad.  You could come back from being a piece of shit.  But selfish old shithead.  But piece of shit, that sums up what you are.  You're not doing something shitty.  You're a piece of shit.  You're a piece of shit.  Yeah, that is bad.  You piece of shit.  Wow.  When's the last time you said to someone you love in a new relationship, you piece of  shit.  Wait a minute.  Let's bring that up.  How long is this going on, this relationship?  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  Very recent.  It's a piece of shit.  You're doomed.  How long is it?  This is a girl.  Brand new.  Piece of shit.  She's not the one from a couple of months ago.  No.  No.  Because you're going through a thing.  God only knows what she called him.  You're going through a thing where...  Honey.  I've heard you use the word girlfriend a couple of times this year.  Yeah.  Well, this is the girl I was dating recently, about a couple months ago.  We're not dating anymore for no bad reasons.  Right.  I'm just a douche.  Piece of shit.  And this one, I'm a piece of shit.  And this one, I didn't expect at all. 
[03:53:00]  This was with a girl who I was friends with for years.  She's one of my best friends.  This one I didn't see coming at all.  Really?  Did not see it coming at all.  No.  At all.  It never saw it coming.  And that's why it's kind of weird.  And we're dating now.  Wow.  Piece of shit.  Selfish.  Are you longing for a girlfriend?  Yes and no.  He's long...  No.  He is.  He wants a girlfriend.  He wants one, but he wants one on his terms.  Right.  But on his terms, it's impossible to be in a relationship.  Right.  Like, there's no way.  Right.  What are the terms?  It's like, I want to be the president, but I want to snort coke and fuck hookers in public. 
[03:53:30]  It's like, well, yeah.  Yeah.  I want you to be a nice girl, but produce a log over nine inches.  Yeah, exactly.  I want you to be the sweetest, nicest girl.  Or at least allow someone else to do that for me.  Right.  Selfish old piece of shit.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  I'm glad I wasn't...  I'm not glad my ex-wife isn't black.  I wonder what words would have popped out of her mouth then.  Jesus.  Selfish old piece of shit.  Wow.  What was your...  Did we discuss your comeback? 
[03:54:00]  Was there a comeback?  What did you say after she said that?  He sulked.  Nothing.  Did you finish watching it?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Some guys might have turned it off.  I know.  The nerve of me now all of a sudden to get balls.  Yeah.  I watched the whole thing.  She admitted she was wrong, too, and I pointed out why I was right to watch that scene.  Then she was like, oh, you were right.  I would have just sat there and just started jerking off or something.  How did you point out you were right?  Because she was in the bathroom when she came out, and a scene was on that I liked. 
[03:54:30]  And she's like, well, you know that stuff really bothers me.  I'm like, you were in the other room.  You walked out.  I go, this is just a scene from Platoon that I love.  I was in the middle of watching a scene.  Why would you have had me stop watching a scene that I was in the middle of, told you I liked,  you knew there was a definitive end to it, and you had walked in the middle of it.  She goes, yeah, I did walk in the middle.  Oh, boy.  You're fighting already.  You're right.  You're just old.  They're fighting.  Yeah.  I know.  You just don't get it.  You're just old.  There's an etiquette these days.  That's right.  We're not talking about when you were a kid.  I know. 
[03:55:00]  Apparently, things have changed.  Yes.  Well, one time we were talking.  It's funny you say that, because she was telling me things she liked about me a long time ago,  because she does comedy.  She's actually very funny.  Everybody says that, but she's funny.  She's a stand-up?  Yeah.  And she's like...  She is funny.  She's like, you're like a mentor to me, and she was telling me she looked up to me.  I'm like, how fucking old do you think I am?  I'm not that much older.  She said a bunch of stuff that made me feel old.  Mentor.  Things got really easy when we invented the microphones. 
[03:55:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Before that.  What was it like when you started, and they had black clubs and white clubs?  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  A homeless man came up to me and said he hadn't had a bite all week, so I fucked him in the  I'm working on that one.  Back in the old days of vaudeville.  Yeah, I'm going to have a time to do her.  What do you bring out, like, a trunk?  Yeah.  An old steamer trunk?  She's looking at my neck.  I've got to change my costume. 
[03:56:00]  She's looking at my neck for the fucking cane mark so I'd get pulled off stage in a wacky  set.  Jesus.  Castrating fucking rotten girl she is.  I've got to get to the Hammerstein ballroom early.  I've got to do my makeup.  Holy shit.  Is it time for my close-up, Mr. DeMille?  That was awful.  What was it like working with red buttons?  Jesus.  How old did she think I am?  That really is.  I'm going to go home.  Would it be funny if I was arrested for killing her when I went home?  Yeah, it would be.  No.  Hysterical.  It would be. 
[03:56:30]  You're on after the juggler.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That hurt my feelings.  That really is something.  But it's a new relationship.  You should grow into it.  You know, this is the price you pay when you want a younger girl, you know, for all those  benefits.  But the bad part is she's going to inevitably think that you're old.  Yeah, but I'm only 10 years older.  And it's like, that's not bad in comedy.  I mean, come on.  10 ain't bad.  No.  Well, please.  I'm 18.  Who am I talking to, Jerry Lee Cumia? 
[03:57:00]  And what are you laughing at, Roman Hughes?  Yeah, exactly.  Enough with you.  I'm just enjoying.  All right.  The best thing was when I first hooked up with my girlfriend.  Now, we've been together seven years now.  But when I first hooked up and took her over mom's house and we went out for a drink and  she couldn't get one because she wasn't old enough to drink. 
[03:57:30]  That's something.  That's a proud moment in front of mom.  Oh, mom.  Oh, that's good.  You know, your last, you know, relationship you were in, she was a drunk.  And it's good to see that this one doesn't drink.  No, mom.  She can't.  She can't yet.  What are you getting here for your sixth anniversary?  Well, I'm going to take her to vote.  I'm going to pick her up at homeroom.  Love to stay, mom, but we've got to get to the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese.  She loves it. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, that was quite the moment.  You and your great guitar work in The Who.  Wow.  That's a good one, Jimmy.  Hey, you want to blow off the deer story and get out of here?  What do you want to do?  Whatever you guys want to do.  We don't have whatever.  I have production to do or Steve will yell at me.  Well, that's not nice.  It's quick.  It's a video that everyone's checking out today.  Let's play it.  Where do Santa's reindeers go on Christmas, especially when they want to shop? 
[03:58:30]  Apparently Target.  You've got to see this video to believe it.  Today's animal watches.  A stray deer wandered into this Des Moines Target, walking right through the front door.  Johnny, I don't know how this happens.  Security cameras apparently captured in a slippery attempt to run down an aisle.  They're chasing him, checking it out.  Yeah, look at this, look at this.  Watch him back off, though, when the deer gets over.  Yeah, big time.  All right, oddly enough, he was apparently heading towards the Christmas section.  Employees were finally able to coax him right through the fire exit.  So it's, it's, it's, yeah, exactly what it is. 
[03:59:00]  I don't know if I would actually approach a deer.  I would approach the deer.  I was really scared that it would kick me or something.  What would your strategy be?  Kind of get him in the back.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Push him in towards the back and lock the door.  Oh my God, they didn't know how to get out of here.  You know what would have been funny?  Yeah, exactly.  It would have been great if someone had improv skills, and he said, what's your strategy?  And she said, I would have sprayed hormones on my lips and then laid back with my mouth  open.  Yeah, it's funny hearing people that aren't funny trying to, like, get out of here. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So what would you do?  I do it on the news all the time.  What would you do?  The latest craze, the improv.  We watch the Fox News with the weather guy.  Oh, yeah.  And the anchor woman always tries to interact and do some improv with the weather guy, and  he is the worst.  You take him off his teleprompter, and he's gone.  And she constantly throws him. 
[04:00:00]  Does he have a go-to freeze?  And he always tries to just get into the weather.  He's like, well, we had quite a windy night last night.  Oh, in your area?  Was it windy?  And my street wind, please blow garbage, pal.  What?  Da?  Da?  He panics.  You see him sweat.  Do we have any of him?  What's his name, the black dude?  Woods.  Mike Woods.  Mike Woods.  I know we had some audio of him really in trouble.  If we could quickly get that.  Oh, is Bill in charge?  Great.  I know.  We should get the Hindenburg disaster. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, get out of the way.  Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods.  Hey, where's Francine?  She's got to plug a show before we get out of here.  I love Francine.  Where is she?  Francine's looking good.  Our little ebony princess.  Oh, she is a sexy girl.  And then we've got to do Line of the Day, and then we've got to get out of here.  Tom Papa at Gotham tonight.  Tonight.  Omnum.  Comedy Club.  Absolutely.  Very funny guy.  Very funny.  What's up, Iraq?  This is Francine.  I heard your show after everyone left Iraq, and you got balls all of a sudden.  He was all timid.  And then when everyone left, and we were gone, I was listening on the way home. 
[04:01:00]  It's like, hey, this is Iraq, and right now we're going to be putting on some of the  death.  And while we were in here, he's like, here's a bit.  It was a couple of months ago.  You might have remembered it.  All of a sudden, you turned into like, Iraq, the jaw.  Then we pegged him with stuff.  Yeah.  And everyone came in here and started shooting with Nerf bow and arrows.  Like, it's supposed to be a professional radio show, and the host is being pelted.  Jack White.  By the way, Than doing some time on Jim Norton's show tonight.  Yes.  Oh.  That's very exciting for Than. 
[04:01:30]  Artie Fuqua and myself and Nathaniel and my friend Gino Bisconti, who I was able to get  a hold of.  Does he still travel with the little monkey thing?  Oh, it's fucking ruffling.  He has a stuffed animal, like, Lucky Charm.  He has a lucky little monkey.  That's creepy.  Like a Lucky Charm?  Yeah, it's a little small thing.  But he doesn't travel without it, and we're in Cleveland, and he left it in a cab.  He left it in a cab.  Good.  And he called the cab company.  In a panic.  They actually brought it back.  Yeah.  They hired it as a driver. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, this one?  All right, this is Mike Woods and Mark Joiella as the Skipper and Gilligan for Halloween.  Oh, this was horrible.  You know, any reputable news show should dress up their staff as members of Gilligan's Island.  That really, you know, because even after Halloween, November 1st, all you're thinking  is these idiots were dressed like Gilligan and Little Buddy and the Skipper, and they're  trying to deliver the news.  Now, who was who?  Which one was Mike Woods? 
[04:02:30]  I don't know.  We'll find out.  I think Mike Woods was playing the Skipper.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Ah, time now for Weather Authority, Jonas Grimsby.  You know, that's really his name they mentioned in the pilot.  And Gilligan.  My little buddy.  How you doing out there, Gilligan?  And they have nothing written.  Hey, what's going on?  Give me some coffee while you're out there.  How about?  It's been a long time.  My goodness.  How's the weather out there?  It's okay.  Yeah?  I think we can get off this island. 
[04:03:00]  Has anybody been laughing at you by chance?  Because we are.  Only my agent told me it was all over.  Oh, really?  Yes.  What do you think the chances are that we're going to get rescued?  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I think our producer just rescued us.  I'll sign whenever you want me to.  We'll see you, little buddy.  Get out of there.  I'm telling you.  Fifty-four degrees.  And we're talking about some sunshine around the place today.  Is anyone going to take me seriously from this point forward?  It doesn't really matter. 
[04:03:30]  Forty-three degrees right now out in Caldwell.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F-minus in my book.  That is awful.  That was cringe-inducing.  Is that fucking...  That couldn't be worse if Ed Bradley was doing it.  Today.  Today.  He's still fresh.  I know.  He's still fresh.  There's not even a scar on his chest yet.  Oh, Jimmy.  What?  I fucking felt bad at Bradley.  I'm teasing.  I liked him.  Obviously, through that joke, you felt bad. 
[04:04:00]  He was in an earring on...  You are an old piece of shit.  I'm trying to think of the words of how to describe...  Yes.  Thank you.  An old piece of shit.  At least I'm not selfish.  I'm selfless.  Selfless.  Selfless.  Right.  I shouldn't have said that.  I liked Ed Bradley.  Francine, what do you got?  Hi, Francine.  Hey.  How are you?  I was listening to it, too, and I thought,  Opie was going to push the button that goes...  I don't do that one.  I thought crickets.  Oh, crickets?  I thought crickets.  Crickets would have been good, too.  Or a car crash.  Love the car crash.  Yeah.  You hear Iraq's sign-off yesterday for his show? 
[04:04:30]  Wait.  My name is Eric, and I hate blacks and Jews.  Now, Eric, why would you sign off like that?  That's horrible.  That is a terrible...  I don't hate Jews, he said.  What an ass.  What's that?  I know.  He's only used that five times.  Yeah, of course.  He knows that long kill, so he uses it.  He knows it makes me laugh.  Francine, what do we got?  We got to go home.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Next week, I'm going to do a comedy show,  and I actually remember where. 
[04:05:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  You do comedy.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I'm going to do the New York Comedy Club.  It's on 241 East 24th Street on Wednesday.  I don't know what November that is.  Is that hat filling up with steam from you thinking?  Wow.  I don't know what November that is.  She's making popcorn in that hat right now.  It really is.  That's the same at the Elephant Man wore.  It's the same at the Elephant Man wore. 
[04:05:30]  Holy shit.  I'm meeting the queen.  I'm not an animal.  I'm a comic.  It's my favorite hat.  I think you look very cute, and I'm very attracted to you.  It's a sexy hat.  Thank you.  It looks good on you.  It's sexy in an Elephant Man kind of way.  Yeah, yeah.  You look good.  If anyone can wear it, it's either the Elephant Man or you.  You're about a selfish old piece of shit.  No disrespect.  I never jerked off to John Merrick. 
[04:06:00]  Here's to you.  Oh, hey.  You got her in your spank bubble Rolodex?  Absolutely.  Nice.  Preston, you got a joke for us?  Tom is a comedy scout.  Yeah, for real.  You opened up for Seinfeld all over the country, all over the world.  I love Seinfeld, by the way.  Wow, going out on a limb.  Did a private show for Clint Eastwood.  Way to get obscure.  And he discovers talent, up-and-coming talent.  I have one really good one.  Okay.  Okay.  Let her rip, just like if you were on stage.  Okay.  Same confidence and everything. 
[04:06:30]  Right to Tom Papa.  All the confidence and everything.  Stand up, because you would do the joke standing up.  Okay.  Would you like a microphone?  It's a brand new one.  All right, stand in the corner.  She's trying it out.  Go over there?  Yeah.  All right, you got a microphone and everything.  She's Connecticut black, by the way.  I can tell.  You can, can't you?  Okay, so I was making breakfast the other day, and I was about to crack an egg, and I  thought to myself, why couldn't abortions be this delicious? 
[04:07:00]  All right, you know something?  That's not bad.  I thought it was hysterical.  You're heading in the right direction.  We forgot to tell you.  You really are.  We forgot to tell you Tom Papa's looking for clean comics.  Yeah.  Clean.  That was clean.  That was clean.  Wow.  Egg.  She might have got a line.  Delicious. 
[04:07:30]  That was pretty good.  Thank you.  I was expecting less than that.  I don't know why.  I've gotten crickets before in other crowds, and I was like, oh, I think that's a good  one, and I think a lot of people-  Or Planned Parenthood?  Yeah, you know, Planned-  I don't think they like those jokes.  Planned Parenthood-  The dumpster behind Sloan Kettering?  I think Planned Parenthood has a shirt this girl said.  The shirt says, I had an abortion, so I'm going to go to Planned Parenthood and get  one, even though I've never had one, and wear it.  I like how she says Planned Parenthood. 
[04:08:00]  I said a lot.  It's fantastic.  Planned Parenthood.  Planned Parenthood.  That's wonderful.  Well, they're planting the eggs somewhere.  Little seedlings.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's not bad.  Thank you.  Why don't we do Line of the Day and get out of here?  Thank you.  Line of the Day, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout  against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any seen before.  Also, don't forget to vote for Line of the Week at iliketolisten.com. 
[04:08:30]  I love our sponsors.  Here is today's...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Can he do it?  He sure can.  Can he do it?  Line of...  The Day.  Here comes...  Love Jimmy singing.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  No, I saw Heidi Klumann's Seal, and I wanted to go grab to her... 
[04:09:00]  Seal.  Yeah, walking, and I wanted to say, has your father seen this?  But I wanted to get it.  And there you are.  Line of the Day from old Jimmy Norton, who's going to be at the Hammerstein Ballroom tonight.  We're all going.  Yes, I will be there tonight.  It's going to be a great show.  And Tom Papa is performing at Gotham.  So if you go to my show at the Hammerstein, you can still catch his Late Show.  He's a really good comic.  And also, tomorrow night at Gotham, which is on 23rd between 7 and 8th Street. 
[04:09:30]  8th Street.  7th and 8th.  I said 7th.  I'll be performing my old bits.  Tom's old bits.  Hey, did you notice that Roland can't say N?  He goes, he is a author, and she is a...  He doesn't say N at all.  He doesn't understand that, yeah.  He doesn't know the rule.  He's a dumb, straight-toothed ass.  Tom, it was a pleasure.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Good to finally be here, guys.  Yeah, we'll have you back soon, hopefully.  Yeah, have you back and actually have you in when you've been here for a half hour, 40 
[04:10:00]  minutes at the wrong building.  I'll just call Jim.  Good one.  Yeah, you call me.  That'd be smarter.  Hey, let's end with Mike in Virginia.  Mike?  Hey, Mike.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I want to take a guess at that sound.  Okay.  Oh, the Japanese sound, yes.  I think it's a Japanese game show where they give men enemas and see who can hold it the  longest.  Oh, my God.  Well, it certainly sounds like...  We end the show with no one getting...  No one got it wrong. 
[04:10:30]  The Japanese sound.  No one gets it.  So listen to the clip and think of your answers for Monday.  How's that sound?  Jeez.  Okay.  We're going to milk this one?  Is that what the ruling is?  I think so.  Okay.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I say we take it to Thanksgiving.  Make it a YouTube contest.  It's easy.  We milk it until we get the right answer.  Absolutely.  And if we get the right answer, we lie, and we keep milking it in case we run out of  shit.  Here's the sound.  One more time.  Have a great weekend.  Have a great weekend.  Have a great weekend. 
[04:11:00]  I don't get it. 
[04:11:30]  Anthony Burt Convier-Kumia.

And U.S. presidents.  Lincoln, what was his biggest impact on the country as president?  He wore a big hat.  You're what they call ignorant.  Don't let her taunts intimidate you.  I'm book smart.  What kind of book?  I just read a lot of Christian novels.  God. 
[04:12:30]  If you have the slightest ability to retain information, you'll win.  I did really bad in high school.  Away with you.  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Anyone can win at this game.
