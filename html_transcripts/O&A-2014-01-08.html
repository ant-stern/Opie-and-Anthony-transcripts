<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, punctuated by frequent profanity and crude humor.  The show began with a lengthy segment heavily focused on MC Search, a hip-hop artist with a new talk show, mocking his Arsenio Hall appearance and the "blue material" on his Facebook page.  The hosts dissected Search's freestyle rap, his catchphrase ("from ratchetness to righteousness"), and questioned his street credibility given his privileged background.  Listener calls briefly contributed to this segment, along with visual comparisons to Joe DeRosa, Bubba Ray Dudley, and Alan Sherman.

The discussion then pivoted to Tonya Harding, referencing her recent media appearances and the Nancy Kerrigan incident, playing clips from an interview.  A brief mention of the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary series, specifically the Bo Jackson documentary, followed.  The show concluded its first major segment with a discussion of Boston Mayor Menino's retirement and the Opie and Anthony podcast, including an upcoming episode edited from a past "Super Show."

The next segment started with a discussion about a surprisingly long podcast episode and segued into Elvis Presley's birthday, including a humorous anecdote about a cake incident involving barbiturates.  A news story about an Alabama quarterback's mother accused of racism for a tweet about black players' grammar sparked a debate, with audio clips and listener calls offering various perspectives.  The hosts also speculated on Dennis Rodman's situation in North Korea and debated the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, featuring Nancy Grace's criticism and various caller opinions. An Elvis story from a caller about his grandfather's disapproval of rock and roll was also shared.  The hosts shared their personal experiences with marijuana and alcohol and offered their opinions of Nancy Grace.

A rambling discussion about beer, hangovers, and the hosts' youthful indiscretions followed. Opie recounted an embarrassing story from his early radio career about bragging about his drinking. He also mentioned finding old love letters from a college girlfriend, hinting at reading them on air.  A lively debate on beer preferences ensued, with opinions on various brands including Blue Moon, Coors, Six Point Resin, Schaefer, and Pabst. A caller, "Doggy Daddy," criticized a mentioned beer, leading to further banter about beer snobbery and hipster culture.  The conversation then shifted to listener-created videos, specifically one featuring news anchors doing the frozen t-shirt challenge. The discussion continued onto dental work, Anthony's upcoming veneers, and Opie's dental problems. A caller, "Doggy Daddy," shared a chlamydia experience, prompting Anthony's jokes about past infections.  A female caller, "Missy," described the "Trailer Park Lounge" in Manhattan.  The hosts also briefly mentioned past encounters with Ryan Reynolds and Edward Norton.

The final segment began with a discussion of a Melissa Harris-Perry clip where a pun initially sounded like a racial slur but was actually referring to "Obamacare."  This was followed by speculation on the change in Cartman's voice on *South Park*.  The hosts discussed news stations' repetitive coverage of the polar vortex, including Sean Hannity's attempt at the frozen t-shirt challenge. A discussion about a man mistaken for Timothy Olyphant in the studio followed, leading to jokes and speculation.  A clip from *American Hustle* led to discussion of the actresses' Long Island accents and segued into the Amy Fisher case, including commentary on movies made about it and their accuracy.  Other 90s scandals, including Tonya Harding, O.J. Simpson, and Hugh Grant were briefly mentioned. A clip from Louis C.K. on *The Tonight Show* discussing a fabricated ice fishing story for *American Hustle* was teased.  The show concluded with Jimmy recounting a scheduling conflict with Chris Hardwick's podcast and the resulting fan reaction.  A brief mention of the SeaWorld controversy and Jimmy's upcoming stand-up shows were included, along with a teaser for a future segment on "living dolls."  Beyond the hosts and crew, no other guests were explicitly mentioned as being in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Woo-hoo!  Yes, good morning everyone.  Yes, let's get ready to broadcast. Here we are.  Can we make that intro a little...  Take it down at one notch?  A little less energetic.  Take it down one fucking notch?  Because it sounds like an amazing show.  It does.  It sounds like an amazing show.  It just leads up to listener disappointment.  And then you realize you're the guy.  Yeah.  It's like, wow, these guys sound amazing. 
[00:00:30]  You sit back and go, oh my god.  These guys are radio legends. I can't wait to hear them.  Wait to hear this.  And you're sitting there going, oh, that's right.  We're the ones that got to talk after this.  It's like, oh.  I'm like, I told Opie, I go, shh, I want to hear these guys.  It's like Mario Batali serving you a bucket of shit.  Right.  It's real.  Thank you, Stacey Keech, the new voice of the Opie and Anthony channel.  I love that Stacey Keech voice, man.  Now that we're a media destination. 
[00:01:00]  Destination.  Started off pretty good with Dean Cain.  Dean Cain.  That's right.  That's a good one.  We got to keep it up.  Yeah.  It was very cool.  A lot of things going on.  I want to say good morning to the knuckleheads.  Oh.  Your knucklehead.  The knuckleheads are...  You a knucklehead.  They used to be called pests, but now that Search called them knuckleheads.  MC Search.  I want to thank MC Search for renaming our pests.  They're now known as knuckleheads. 
[00:01:30]  Now we talked about Search as a show.  Well, I want to thank you for bringing it to the radio program yesterday.  I am fully involved and obsessed.  Pretty amazing.  We talked about it.  And now, much like in Jocktober, when we talk about a radio show, we kind of know that the  fans do go to the Facebook page.  You know, we don't tell them to do it, but it's just become something that they do.  Right.  I had no clue that when we were talking about Search's show there, that that's what the  listeners were doing.  Right.  They were going to his Facebook page and posting horrific things. 
[00:02:00]  Well, they were posting giant black cocks.  Oh, I saw that.  What?  He was on Arsenio last night.  Right?  Oh, right.  So he just tells the band, yo, yo, little music.  Oh, no way.  I'm a freestyle.  Freestyled.  So he freestyled about like Arsenio and his new show.  But I was thinking about yesterday.  He had, we said he had two hits.  I'm going back to one and a half.  That's it.  He was a one and a half hit wonder. 
[00:02:30]  What is he talking about?  I have no fucking idea.  He's really pumping up what his career was.  I think he is.  He had Pop Goes the Weasel and the Weasel Goes Pop.  By the way, Henry Rollins played Vanilla Ice in that video.  Oh, did he?  Oh, I didn't know that.  Someone told me that and I didn't look it up.  Might be fake.  I hope that was real.  The guy's full of shit.  Because I just fucking hijacked someone's tweet.  Oh, boy.  Hijacked it.  Made it my own.  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  So I guess, so somebody tweeted and brought it to Search's attention. 
[00:03:00]  That is, Facebook page.  Had some blue material on it.  Some blue.  Blue material.  He used the word blue.  You might want to take a look.  It's a little blue.  And then MC Search retweeted it.  The Twitter said, yeah.  Love the talk show.  Keep keeping it real.  But your Facebook page had some weird stuff on it.  A little blue for my taste.  Yes.  A little blue for my taste.  That is so one of our listeners.  Of course.  Because he says, keep keeping it real.  Yeah, this guy isn't watching Search's new show.  No.  Okay. 
[00:03:30]  He's quoting Denny.  Right.  And then MC Search tweeted back, thank you for bringing it to my attention.  That was added by some knuckleheads with too much time on their hands.  Well, he's got to say something.  I mean, he can't go.  Yeah, I do stink.  Enjoy.  Yeah, those guys are right.  I should be killed.  Also, be careful, because DJ Who Kid is all about Search.  Is he?  I saw him tweet saying, you know, congrats on the new show, brother man, brother man. 
[00:04:00]  MC Search is very well respected in the hip-hop community.  If I may.  For what reason?  He keeps it real.  And he kind of discovered Nas.  He did.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a pretty legit.  He's not legit, because he's not from the streets.  Oh, he's from the streets.  That's his first line.  Went to the Fame High School, didn't he?  Huh?  Went to the Fame High School.  Yeah, that's what we talked about yesterday.  If I may quote DJ Who Kid, I believe he says, MC Search is my nigga.  I think he says that.  Right, that's a direct quote.  That's a direct quote. 
[00:04:30]  Nice, I like that.  DJ Who Kid.  DJ Who Dad.  DJ Who Dad.  Stupid lady died.  Yeah, so he called everybody knuckleheads, I guess.  Knuckleheads.  And then he was on Arsenio last night.  Okay, now we get to the Arsenio.  It was a love fest, I've got to tell you.  They hugged like young lovers.  Right.  And I guess Arsenio.  I guess if a has-been sees another has-been, you've got to hug it out.  It's like when school bus drivers pass each other. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  They give the little wave, you know?  The has-been wave.  It's the has-been wave.  And we're not above that, I know.  One day we'll be in the street and we'll be hugging it out with some other has-beens ourselves.  Hugging it out.  Just hugging it out.  So, and yeah, so he comes out and then he brought it to everyone's attention that apparently  he was on the original Arsenio Hall show back in the day.  Right.  Many times.  Right.  Like many times.  Third base?  Third base.  Third base.  Not Hazen base.  Not Hazen base.  Third base. 
[00:05:30]  So, it was just a schmaltzy, maudlin ass-lapping of Search and of Arsenio.  How is that Arsenio Hall?  I was going to say it's the worst show on television, but since Search came on, I'm not sure.  It's unwatchable.  I've got to be honest.  I thought they canceled Arsenio Hall because you don't hear anything about it.  I know he was starting up his talk show again and there was a lot of hype and then nothing. 
[00:06:00]  So, I just assume that they fucking got rid of it.  There's no buzz.  The guests he gets are, I mean, I'm sure he was, he got this because it's on the same  channel here in New York, you know, WPIX.  Right.  What, is Search a big get?  Search is a big get, yo.  Do you think he really improv'd the song or he had some of the lines before he went in?  Oh, God.  I, it's so bad, I don't know.  It's just, it's bad.  I don't know.  I was watching this and I was so, I was deuce chilling out. 
[00:06:30]  I couldn't even look at Beavis.  I was that embarrassed.  I'm like, ah, ah, very embarrassing.  Before we get into it, do you want a little MC Search appetizer?  What is that?  What is that?  That is right.  This is Search talking to Arsenio going from ratchetness to righteousness in 60 seconds.  Yeah, I do remember that.  We have to hear this.  That way it brings everybody on board with who MC Search really is. 
[00:07:00]  Did he find that A yet?  No, he's been searching for it.  He's searching for it.  He's still searching for the A to spell search properly.  And of course, I mixed it up and thought it was MC Reach because he was going to reach  people with his show.  And then it was pointed out to me that without the A, it's Wretch.  It's DJ Wretch.  And I don't think he would like that.  Well, he doesn't want his audience saying bitches and hoes and all that.  No, no, no.  And he's up in his game.  He's wearing a suit and tie.  So how about you add the A to your name?  He ain't about that.  So kids nowadays could figure out how to spell search properly.  Because I did also see him on the WPIX News at 5 last night. 
[00:07:30]  And I am obsessed.  You're a stalker.  You're like a stalker, Anthony.  I can't stop watching this guy.  We're going to sleep on him.  So you're a bigger fan of him than Mancow.  You're going to sleep on his couch at his house?  Maybe.  Maybe I'll get that lucky.  Are you going to bake him some cookies?  Bring them over?  Yeah, yeah.  Welcome him to his new show?  Welcome, welcome.  Yeah, he was on that.  And he was, you know, he was talking. 
[00:08:00]  He was talking some truth.  Some more truth.  Yeah, a lot of truth.  Realness.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think we could all handle a little truth.  Well, that's part of the thing.  It's like calling people bitches is more ratchetness.  Well, he said he's like Dr. Phil from the streets.  What streets?  I don't know.  He's not from the streets.  He's got Jewish parents that sent him to a privileged high school.  When Arsenio brought that up at some point last night.  Oh, he did?  He brought up the fact.  He goes, now you're a conservative Jewish guy. 
[00:08:30]  You grow up with your parents there.  And his accent immediately changed back to Jewish white guy.  Oh, yeah.  He could switch that accent.  He's not fooling anyone.  Picture him just putting on a different jacket, depending on who he's talking about.  That would be great.  He's putting on a jacket for the black guy, a jacket for the white guy.  And then yesterday on his show, Search, at the end he did his Search 60.  Yeah.  And he uses the same quote every day about it with his wife.  Ew. 
[00:09:00]  As my wife Chantel says.  Yeah, and it was the same quote.  Well, he likes saying his wife's name because Chantel means he's married to a black woman and he likes broadcasting.  He likes letting everyone, oh, does he love letting people know.  I like that Chantel.  Chantel?  Yeah, I love it.  It keeps my hair nice and shiny.  It is good.  Thank you.  It's good stuff.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Oh, yeah.  I drank some during New Year's Eve.  Some Chantel?  I popped a good bottle of Chantel.  And he means the fucking shampoo.  I had nothing left in that house. 
[00:09:30]  Jesus.  Like Kitty Dukakis.  The Sterno.  The fucking Altyzer.  Ooh, the amazing Sterno, the Magnificent.  Let's listen to this 60-second clip and then we can do some freestyle with Search and then hopefully we can move the fucks on from Search.  Never.  Enough about Search.  But he's everywhere because what?  The show just started up?  The show just started.  We're two episodes deep.  Has he wandered these halls yet?  No, and he's not everywhere.  He's everywhere on Channel 11.  Oh.  I see.  So they're all being forced to take the search. 
[00:10:00]  Well, when Arsenio gave him the big plug at the end, it's never a good sign when you have to go,  Yo, check your local listings in time for Times and Channel.  Oh, man.  What?  He must not be on all of those stations.  No, no.  They're still testing him out.  Right.  So he's in some major markets.  But the article I read said he did pretty well.  Because you can't not watch this.  Right.  It's so fucking bad.  I'm obsessed with watching it now.  Didn't Danza do well for a while, too?  I mean, Danza for a long time did good. 
[00:10:30]  And that was another disaster.  Yeah.  Right.  But he loves, like, he loves yelling out cities' names, like, Pittsburgh!  Philly!  He does that to people in the audience.  And yells at them?  He yells it.  He's a man of a certain age at this point.  That's another thing.  It's like, oh, you shouldn't be spitting out some fucking freestyles when it makes your waddle under your neck shake.  Your waddle.  Let's listen to this from Arsenio Hall.  Last night, I guess. 
[00:11:00]  A little freestyling.  No, this is not freestyling yet.  Right now, it's just a little talking about going from ratchetness to righteousness.  Oh, all right.  Let's see how you do that.  Oh, boy.  You've gone away and become a doctor, apparently.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, well.  I psychologically analyze people and find their namasutras in their equilibriums and their prefrontal cortex.  And then I just, no, I don't know what I'm talking about.  See, we got people bombing.  We got people bombing.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  He's not a doctor.  That was just jibber-jabber right there. 
[00:11:30]  Can I tell you what the inside word on the show is?  Please.  Uh-oh.  That you're actually helping some people.  Oh, God.  Arsenio, this is so maudlin.  This is like everything a talk show is not supposed to be.  You're actually helping some people.  You're actually helping.  It's two episodes deep.  The competition.  That's who he's helping.  And I've never seen a head shaped like that before.  Arsenio, it's like a triangle head.  It looks like Omar almost, doesn't it? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, a little Omar going on there.  It looks like a diamond.  Yeah.  He looks like a newborn that got pulled out by the head.  Yeah, yeah.  It's still soft.  Yep.  It's still soft.  What the hell's going on with his head?  Did he lose too much weight?  Is that what it is?  I think he just got old.  He's very pointy.  Very.  There's a lot of points on his head.  I like how you said that the inside, that's what they're saying, like behind the scenes.  Yeah, yeah.  The inside word, they're two shows deep.  The public is saying it stinks, but your producers are saying you're really helping quite a few people.  Right.  He has less hair than he used to. 
[00:12:30]  That's why his head shape is so fucking bullet.  Well, he's not going with the fade anymore.  Up the side.  But this guy's not keeping it real.  That's the theme of the show, that he's keeping it real.  He's different because he's keeping it real?  Because he's from the streets.  Come on.  All right.  Yeah.  Some people.  Because a lot of these shows entertain us, and we love to see people punch each other and pull each other's top off.  But I hear you're not doing as much of that, and you're actually helping some people by the end of these shows.  Yeah, no, when this opportunity came back to me, I wanted to say I'll have conflict on the show because everybody wants to see people argue and complain. 
[00:13:00]  But if we can't get to resolution, then I don't want to do the show.  My friend Ebro from Hot 97 says we go from ratchetness to righteousness.  And that's what the show is.  Plus.  Come on.  Right?  Right?  So uncomfortable.  Well, we saw most of an episode yesterday, so you're trying to tell me the black kid that's 22 with four different girls with six kids is now doing the right thing? 
[00:13:30]  By the time the credits rolled, it was all about righteousness.  And so that guy's now doing the right thing.  Righteousness.  Oh, okay.  And he did say, he did say, I respect you as a father for fathering those nine kids.  For fathering those nine kids.  I respect you as a father.  He went from boring to dull.  That was his transition.  Somebody also said yesterday, because we were trying to figure out who he looked like, and we figured it was a chubby Joe DeRosa.  But somebody also said Bubba Ray Dudley.  There's a little Bubba Ray Dudley in him. 
[00:14:00]  That's funny.  Perhaps.  There's somebody else, though.  Yeah, there is.  It's driving me nuts.  Yeah, I can't figure it out either.  And what's going on in Hot 97?  If he gets to go to a stage like Hot 97, they're actually saying you're going from ratchetness to righteousness, and they're kissing his ass?  They love this guy.  He is hip-hop.  He got respect back in the day.  I think the paper had a look-alike.  Did they?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I've got to find it.  I thought I saw that this morning.  Ah.  Where was it? 
[00:14:30]  Where was I looking?  Pick up your worksheets.  Oh, boy.  Turn to page.  I saw it somewhere.  Yeah.  Go this way.  Oh, okay.  There's an uncanny resemblance between newly minted Channel 11 talk show host Search and 60s parody king Alan Sherman.  Oh, really?  Who the fuck's Alan Sherman?  I thought you were goofing.  And the paper really did like a, he looks like somebody?  Oh, yes.  Sorry.  Wow, that's amazing.  This guy, Alan Sherman.  Oh, shit.  He does. 
[00:15:00]  He does.  He does.  He does.  I don't really know Alan Sherman.  I don't either.  That name sounds a bit familiar.  But he's got the hairdo, the glasses.  But who's Alan Sherman?  What does he know for?  He's known for keeping it real, apparently.  Maybe we should get Dennis Falcone to.  Oh, Alan Sherman?  I remember Alan Sherman.  What do they say about Alan Sherman?  A wonderful guy.  Very funny.  Very funny stuff.  Oh, he did Hello, Mudder.  Hello, Fata.  Oh, God. 
[00:15:30]  Keeping it real at Camp Grinna.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  All right.  Back to search.  Keeping it real.  Yeah.  Here he is on Arsenio.  That's what the show is.  Because I want to get to the core of the problem.  You know, and it's from years of personal therapy.  It's from 23 years of marriage to the same woman.  It's from raising three kids.  It's from all of that.  And it's from years of marriage counseling and years of personal therapy and meeting people that don't have those opportunities, 
[00:16:00]  that didn't have that chance to talk to somebody and say, whoa.  What kind of great marriage is that?  It's 23 years of marriage counseling.  Yeah.  And therapy.  And then you're quoting her at the end of your show.  Just the therapist just kept telling him not to drop the N-bomb.  Every two seconds.  At the end of my wife, Chantel, says, fuck me better or I'm going to leave you.  It's cool.  It's just, I don't, I can't live in that world. 
[00:16:30]  Obviously, we can't live in that world.  It's so alien.  Marcella Hall knows he's just bullshitting and that he's just trying to do a Jerry Springer show  because that's the type of TV people like during the day.  Exactly.  He's not doing anything different.  The set looks exactly like Maury or Springer or any of them.  It's a Springer show.  But.  Yeah.  With a DJ set up in the background.  Yeah.  Did you notice that picture?  There's a DJ set up in the background just in case he wants to scratch a little.  And what?  Do a little freelancing? 
[00:17:00]  Freelancing.  He did do a little freelancing.  Freestyle.  It's freelancing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's more of a freelance guy.  Oh, he's not done with his summation of the show.  Talking about ratchet hoes.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That looks familiar.  And I can tell you where that's coming from.  Let me tell you where it's coming from.  Let me break it down for you real quick.  Quick, damn.  And get to that point.  All right.  Nobody is watching this dumb show.  And that's the clip Arsenio uses to push his show. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, no.  He's got him freestyling.  Hold on.  That's the clip.  Greg in Brooklyn wants to add something here.  Greg.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm just curious.  Yesterday I go to sleep.  I hear about search.  I wake up and fucking search.  You're right.  Fucking destination.  Fucking fuck it.  Hey, as an immediate destination, we've got to be all about the new shows out there.  This is brand new.  Because he's a media destination as well.  Stop this shit.  Stop this fucking repeat. 
[00:18:00]  Stop it.  Are you from the mean streets of Brooklyn?  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  I thought you had more on search.  You don't really.  Moron.  All right.  All right.  Here he is.  A little freestyling.  It's freelancing.  You hear him freelance on the Oshiniel Hall show?  Got his own show.  What did he do?  He makes it look like, look how good I am.  He told the band, yeah, you know that thing you was doing before with the four on the eight  and the fucking night.  No, he didn't.  Oh, he did.  He did.  But that was when they were sitting in the Nas, the Nas spot, they call it. 
[00:18:30]  The Nas spot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, Arsenio's got the couch, right?  And the desk.  And some guests go there.  But then he's got something that, just a little inside thing they call around the studio,  the Nas spot.  And it's where Nas performed right there on the show.  And they put a couple of seats out there in front of the band.  That's where you talk with your musical guests and your hip hop guys and, you know, you guys  that keep it real.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Whew. 
[00:19:00]  So the band has to just stand behind you?  Yes.  And try to fake laugh at your jokes while the cameras are?  How embarrassing.  I was trying to look at every black member of the band and see if they were making any  kind of sarcastic, like, faces about Search.  But they didn't.  I'll be honest.  And then does he say, hey, let's start as if they didn't rehearse and the band didn't  know it was coming?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we understand.  There's got to be some show biz.  A little freestyle.  We understand there's a little show biz happening.  Not when you're keeping it real.  That's true.  If you're keeping it real, it's not about show biz. 
[00:19:30]  People are saying that Search's wife is really hot.  Real, yeah?  Is there a picture of her online?  I saw a quick picture at the beginning of the show.  They show her.  Chantel.  And the kids to reinforce the fact, like, hey, come on.  Married a black chick.  I think he married her in 92 when he was really famous, didn't he?  Yeah.  How about that shit?  Where's the Chantel?  Is she the white Chantel or the black Chantel?  It's popping up.  She's pretty if that's her.  She's a black chick, yo.  She's black, definitely. 
[00:20:00]  Black chick, yo.  No.  Just put Search's wife, Chantel.  And then image that shit.  MC Search.  Image that shit.  Let's see what comes up.  Yeah.  Is that how else?  What up?  What up?  What up?  Hmm.  Oh.  This site be fronting.  She's hot.  Okay.  Yeah, she's hot.  He doing it.  He doing it.  He's doing it.  Very lovely.  That's some pop goes to weasel pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's definitely his pop go to weasel pussy. 
[00:20:30]  It's just a dumb novelty song.  He did one novelty song.  Yeah.  I think around 95 she started knocking on his bedroom.  He's like, are you writing at least?  Are you working on another one?  Yeah.  Is this something?  She was hoping that that was going to be the springboard for an amazing career in music?  She calls Biz Markie's wife.  What happened?  I don't know.  They just got lazy, I guess, after 93.  What's wrong with these guys? 
[00:21:00]  That's funny.  Ah, shit.  All right.  Here he goes.  I kind of want to show them the mind that I enjoyed 20 years ago.  We got to make him freestyle, please.  Yes.  Absolutely.  He's so eager to do it.  Those last eight bars that you're doing for the hate bar.  Arsenio Hall is so unwatchable.  He does that thing.  He's such a fucking phony.  He's so fucking phony.  Just be yourself.  I watch it too. 
[00:21:30]  Like everything's important and profound and off the top of his head.  But he's not in touch with the room.  No.  Because then he goes to the audience.  Yeah, you don't mind that, right?  It's like, shut up.  They're already clapping.  I didn't like how Serge didn't even pretend to debate it.  Right.  Would you be willing to?  Yes, I would.  He would be like, shut up.  Okay, sir.  That's what he looks like, Dewey Oxberger.  He does look like Dewey.  A lot of peaches. 
[00:22:00]  Go back to the beginning, because Arsenio is over the top fucking.  He's acting, basically.  Show them the mind that I enjoyed 20 years ago.  We got to make him freestyle, please.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yo, those last eight bars that you were doing for the hate room.  Or can he do that?  Can he?  You want to?  Oh, I don't need a mic.  You don't need a mic?  No, I'm good.  I'm good.  You don't need to hold it real close, then. 
[00:22:30]  No, no, no, I'm good.  Go, go, go, go, Serge.  20 years ago, I was on Arsenio, and now I'm back here talking about my talk show with  a whole lot of good-looking people like there.  That white boy with the blonde hair.  How you doing, son?  What's good with you, kid?  Yo, I hope you watch my show, and I hope that you live a positive life.  And shout out to my wife who's backstage, hoping that I don't flip or go knife.  I mean, cut up.  Let me shut up for a second real quick and just come back up and, excuse me, let me rhyme 
[00:23:00]  again.  It's my time again.  I dropped dimes up again.  Oh, I studied, but I'm still butter.  Don't think nothing about this.  Bad mother.  Oh, shut your mouth.  No cursing, no rehearsing.  This is just plain searching.  Arsenio.  All right.  What?  Oh, my God.  It's Bob Kelly rapping.  It's Bob Kelly rapping.  Do you have the Bob Kelly clip?  Oh, I hate the Bob Kelly clip.  Do you have the Bob Kelly clip?  Yes.  All right.  Hold on, though. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Play the first 10, 15 seconds again, and then we're going to play the Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly raps just as good as Sirk.  And we hate Bob Kelly rap.  That was so fucking embarrassing.  Was that?  You didn't like that?  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah.  Travis, you got it.  Hold on.  One second.  Hang on.  Yeah, no worries.  It's Bob Kelly rapping.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  About our show.  Oh, yeah.  When he freestyled.  Or freelanced.  Freestyle. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  Should we play this while Travis is getting it?  Yeah, I don't know where half this shit gets moved.  Is Eric around?  Yeah, just hang on.  Hang on.  Can we hear him trudging down the hall?  Any trudger?  Oh, trudger.  Well, Eric has his own system.  We can play Search at least.  Play a little bit of the Search again. 
[00:24:30]  Search.  Hey, bars are you doing for the hate?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do that.  Can you?  You want to?  Oh, I don't need a mic.  You don't need a mic?  No, I'm good.  I'm good.  Are you serious?  I'm good.  Go, go, go, search.  20 years ago, I was on a Cineo, and now I'm back here talking about my talk show with a  whole lot of good-looking people like that.  That white boy with the blonde hair.  How you doing, son?  What's good with you, kid?  Yo, I hope you watch my show, and I hope that you live a positive life. 
[00:25:00]  And shout out to my wife who's backstage, hoping that I don't flip.  I'll go nightclub.  Let me shut up for a second real quick and just come back up and excuse me, let me rhyme  again.  It's my time again.  I dropped down.  I'm just again.  Not enough.  I've studied, but I'm still butter.  Don't think nothing's at this bad motherfucker.  I studied, but I'm still butter.  This guy's good.  No cursing, no rehearsing.  This is just plain searching.  Cineo.  Yeah.  And now it's going to sound very familiar, because then Bob Kelly did this for us one day. 
[00:25:30]  All right, ready?  I'm hanging on the show with my friend Ant and Greg.  We all of a sudden start to eat eggs.  We get them down and talk into the mic, because you know we don't like to fuck the diet.  We like pussy, and it's got to be juicy.  Don't laugh at me, Anthony, while I'm on the mic.  You might not know how to fuck a diet.  I'll say it twice.  You don't give a shit.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow. 
[00:26:00]  Anthony has hair that makes you go, V.  Yep.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  It's the same cadence.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude, fuck you.  You know when that dog you had is a fucking mutt.  Opie had the right moves, because his steak was on the floor, and his potatoes weren't there no more.  So he killed that motherfucker, rough, rough, rough.  But you know what?  It's nothing any better or worse.  Exactly.  That's my point.  Yeah.  Bobby's is more entertaining, actually.  Right.  And actually, he's coming up with stuff.  Half of the search raft was... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, half of the search, you know, freestyling was actually material...  He went with little chunks of...  Little chunks of airy hats.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah!  He's butter.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm butter.  He might stutter.  He stuttered, but he's still butter.  All right, we'll keep tabs on his search.  Where is he going to pop up next?  Oh, yeah.  So we're not checking on 11.  I'm on it.  You're on it, obviously.  Oh, I am all over this new search. 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  I don't know why I enjoy things that, like, just make me, like, cringe like that.  I think a lot of people like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Every fan of this show.  One of my favorite stupid things to do, I wake up early on the weekends because of what  we do, and I watch the local news.  I go from channel to channel to channel.  It is so douchey, but I can't get enough of how unbelievably bad it is. 
[00:27:30]  You just have to keep watching.  I don't get it.  It's just so much fun.  Yeah.  Because for some reason, people just don't want to be themselves.  They feel like if they're on TV doing local news, they have to fit into some weird, like, role.  Yep.  I don't know.  It's unbelievable to me.  Is Arsenio giving him the double guns there?  Of course he is.  You got it after a freestyle.  He kind of bent back a little, bent his legs, arched back a little, and then he goes, pew,  gave him the double guns. 
[00:28:00]  Arsenio's just bothersome, though.  Oh, it's terrible.  He's terrible.  He's over the top.  I'm just waiting until I know I can watch Seinfeld at 11 again.  Oh, really?  Oh, it took over for Seinfeld?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They pushed Seinfeld off to midnight.  Go watch Jerry's fucking coffee and cars with comedians or whatever the hell.  I've seen a few of them.  I've seen a few of them.  I've got to watch the rest.  I was telling you guys about the Carl Ryan or Mel Brooks one.  It's fucking great.  Travis turned me on to that episode.  It's fucking great.  Mel Brooks is 85 and completely there. 
[00:28:30]  It's still hilarious and telling just stories and just keeping the attention of the room.  Yep.  Unbelievable.  And to watch someone like Jerry just kind of, you know, starstruck.  A childhood idol.  I mean, Mel Brooks is a childhood idol of most guys.  And Mel Brooks has never seen Jerry Seinfeld perform.  But he doesn't need to, I guess.  But you would think he would have.  It's not.  It's a great series.  It really is.  It's my first web series that I'm really into because I know a lot of people are trying web series and stuff. 
[00:29:00]  You want to freestyle about it?  Well.  Go ahead.  Give it a couple.  Go ahead.  You'll be good.  All right.  All right.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  It's just awful.  I hope nothing happened during that conversation.  What do you mean?  Well, yesterday, a bunch of knuckleheads might have, you know.  Leave the search alone.  He's trying to keep it real.  He's just trying to keep it real.  Add the A to your name, you idiot. 
[00:29:30]  You're an adult now.  He's trying to keep it real.  You're a middle-aged man.  Get the A in there so the kids know how to spell search.  Right.  At least get that done.  He's ruining young minds.  That should be your first goal.  Who's this guy?  He's actually from Jersey.  Right across the bridge.  Oh, he's the right across the bridge intern guy.  He looks like every college student that accidentally, like, rapes a stripper at a fucking bachelor party.  Yes.  He has that look. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  Who picks these guys?  Iraq has a type.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He has a type.  The interns are all, like, that same guy.  Yeah.  Especially the male interns.  Yeah.  Iraq likes the guy that can massage him deep.  Deep tissue massage.  Or those chubby shoulders.  Strong man.  We're past phase one.  What are you talking about?  What happened?  Well, MC Surge's wall on Facebook is not public.  Oh, damn.  But he advertises, I'm going to be on the Insider tomorrow. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  And one of the comments is, Dennis Falcone has a big dong.  Oh, see, that has nothing to do with the Insider.  I was watching one of those shows last night.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know which one, and I'm being completely honest, because they're the exact same show.  Access Hollywood, Insider, E.T.  Yeah.  And, man, they had Tonya Harding on.  Oh, yeah.  It was like 20 years.  It's 20 years, and I think they're doing a 30 on 30 with her.  Where is that?  HBO, ESPN, whatever the fuck? 
[00:31:00]  ESPN.  ESPN?  Yeah.  Tonya Harding.  She looks like a beast, first of all.  She's on one of those shows.  And she is not apologizing for nothing.  She's on one of those shows, those clip shows there on Spike, I think.  Is it new?  No, those ones where she, I think they do still film new ones.  They've got, like, Willis from fucking, you know, different strokes.  I couldn't get over her yellowing teeth.  Oh, you don't like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's got yellowing teeth. 
[00:31:30]  I couldn't really.  She is the epitome of fucking white trash right there.  Dude, she is so white trash.  She's even bigger than that.  Because they're talking about how she got, you know, a bit large.  I'd still bang her.  All I would want her to do is tell me about Jeff Galuli's big dick fucking knocking her out.  Remember that porno she did where she sounded like a nine-inch dick?  Right.  She was fucking hot.  She was skating in the old days.  She's got very icy eyes, man.  There's something not right there.  You think she's a kook?  Oh, boy.  I think there's going to be a nice headline eventually. 
[00:32:00]  What an amazing story that was.  Just clobbering a skater's kneecap.  Kneecap in a fucking skater.  And it's ice skaters.  It's not like football players.  It's ice skaters that shit went down with.  Did that end her career, Nancy Kerrigan, or no?  That was pretty much it.  Pretty much it.  Yeah, I mean, that was her shot.  I mean, and Tanya's a little pissed because, like, you know, Nancy Kerrigan has no comments  whatsoever.  Ah, she wants to get into a little beef. 
[00:32:30]  Well, I mean, you know.  She's only doing one interview for this, like, anniversary type thing that NBC has during  Olympics.  Calls her a cunt, and that's it.  Do we have any clips of what I saw last night?  I should have told you guys.  I want to hear the original clip, too, that fucking, when she got whacked.  Oh, her screaming.  Why?  Why?  Why me?  Why?  It's a ballsy move.  Come in there and kneecap her.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  The fucking mafia of skating.  It really is.  Unbelievable.  Years ago, two skaters were vying for the Olympic team, Nancy Kerrigan and Tanya Harding, 
[00:33:00]  when suddenly Kerrigan was attacked.  Well, tonight, all these years later, Tanya Harding talks to our partner network, ESPN,  about that day and that event.  This is good.  And here's ABC's John Don Van.  It was art and grace and weightlessness.  And then it was tabloid.  Twenty years ago, two working-class girls who had grown up into two world-class skaters, 
[00:33:30]  Nancy Kerrigan and Tanya Harding, both with a shot at Olympic gold.  And then this.  Someone went after Nancy Kerrigan, tried to break her leg, whacking it with a rod just above  the knee.  Why?  Why?  Why?  It turns out that someone was hired by a certain Jeff Gil-Hooley, who was married to Tanya  Harding.  Well, everybody got caught.  Harding was rounded up, too.  Thank you so much for talking to you guys.  Absolutely.  It was born almost there.  There'll be more in a few days. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, hopefully.  How are you feeling right now?  It's been a long week, but we're feeling okay.  I am.  Harding ended up pleading guilty to conspiracy, though to this day, she says she only learned  of the plot after the hit had happened on Kerrigan.  I never met or talked to.  Didn't even know the other persons that were involved.  I mean, everything just, you know, you get hit by everything all at once, and you just  want to, like, crawl in a closet and say, go away, leave me alone, because you just don't  know what's going on. 
[00:34:30]  Kerrigan went on to win silver at the Lillehammer Games that year, and since then, neither  woman has said much about it, which makes it a rare thing that Harding is talking now  in a new ESPN documentary.  Still angry about a sport, she says, where the judges always have their favorites.  There was one year that I had, like, a bright pink color that I made myself.  I mean, it was really pretty.  One of the judges came up to me afterwards and said, you know what?  And if you ever wear anything like that again at a U.S. championships, you will never do 
[00:35:00]  another one.  So I had a woman's leg broken.  I said, well, you know what?  If you can come up with $5,000 for a costume for me, then I won't have to make it.  Don't be cunt to the judges.  But until then, stay on my face.  And I turned around and walked off, and Diane was like, oh my God.  But that's how they are.  She's hateable.  But if it's not their way, it's the highway.  They're the judges.  But this isn't about that. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  John Donovan.  ABC News.  Apparently she was on Mr. Red once.  She's a problem.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a good 30 on 30.  She's a little whacker, man.  Where's my 30 on 30 box set?  She did that porno, though.  I forgot to do that.  Didn't her husband film it?  That's why.  Jeff Gilhulli, he filmed that porno.  I thought they said galoo.  It was always galooly.  It's just become galooly.  Fuck the way he wants to hear it.  Old Jeff Big Dick.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:36:00]  Jeff Delicious Cock.  Jeff Lucky.  Remember Jeff Gift Giver.  But I remember her riding that, and it was like their honeymoon video.  It was really hot.  It felt hidden video.  Oh, yeah.  Big pig.  All right.  We should.  No, it's just coming.  He walked along down the hall.  That was terrible.  I was coming.  Nothing.  Nothing there, Mr. Rock.  They were very nice to you as you were walking up the hall.  There it is.  I ask, and here it is.  Stop with video game shirts.  There's a 30 for 30 box set now. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Have you guys watched any of these 30 for 30s?  They're really good, man.  I'm so not a sports guy.  And I know there's those little twists and kind of unique stories about it, but.  Well, they pick really good stories.  Really good stories.  The No Moss one, I loved.  Oh, Duran and Leonard.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was great.  What's 30?  Is it a half hour show?  Yeah.  On ESPN.  No, it's more than that.  Most of them are one hour.  Yeah.  I spoke out of turn.  What does 30 for 30 mean?  30 for 30 was originally they were doing 30 documentaries for the 30th anniversary of ESPN. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, right.  It was so successful that they just keep doing them now.  Yeah.  I just said, yeah.  No, they're a lot longer than 30.  Sorry.  They're full length for the most part.  Yeah.  They're great.  I don't think you even have to be a sports fan to watch.  No, that's what I'm saying.  It's like any documentary.  Oh.  Yeah, they pick really good stories.  Well, Travis, I guess I have to watch it now.  Yeah, the Bo Jackson one's great.  Bo Jackson one's great.  The Islanders one is really good.  I didn't see the Bo Jackson one.  Why is that one great?  It's just awesome.  It's his story.  It's his story.  He's got one of the best stories.  What is his story?  I don't care if he gives it away.  Bo knows. 
[00:37:30]  He's played a couple of different sports.  Sure.  He's probably the greatest athlete ever.  What happened to him after it all went bad?  Does he have money and stuff?  Do they talk about that?  No, but I don't know if he has money, because back in those days, there wasn't these giant  contracts that people have now.  He had some endorsement deals, though.  That's for sure.  He makes arrows for bows.  He's an arrow maker now?  He's a great archery guy.  I don't know what they're called.  I would hope so. 
[00:38:00]  That's a little weird.  See, that's why you've got to watch these things.  Isn't that like what Indians did?  Yeah.  Makes them out of obsidian.  He was the heavyweight champion.  Now he's a canoe hollower outer.  What?  Hollower outer.  What the fuck does that happen?  Like, that's what he does.  What the fuck does that happen?  You're right.  I guess you've got to continue with your life, though.  Yes.  Yeah.  For us, we want him to be Bo Jackson forever, but eventually he's got to move on and do  something.  Do you think coaching gets frustrating to watch all this young talent come up?  Maybe some of these guys are going to be out of that life and not see it. 
[00:38:30]  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  We've got food in front of us.  We're going to take a break and continue with some other things.  Oh, you know what?  Can we play the Mayor Menino thing going into break?  I will remember you.  Yeah.  He was the mayor of Boston for 20 years, and he's finally officially done.  And he's done, man.  I think Monday was his last day.  Goodbye.  After 20 years.  Yeah.  You outlasted Mayor Menino.  Me and Anthony started doing radio when he became the mayor of Boston.  And he just stepped in. 
[00:39:00]  Jesus Christ.  And that story was right before me and Anthony started doing radio together.  The Tonya Harding thing.  I remember we were commenting on that shit like on the BAB show.  Yeah, because it was still happening.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  It was still happening when we finally started doing radio together.  Then it got a little overshadowed by, you know.  Another sports figure.  No.  Hacking apart his wife and a friend.  Oh, yeah.  This was before the OJ.  I have da brain cancer.  That's what OJ's saying now.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if it's true or anything, but he wants to get out.  So he's like, I have da brain cancer.  How much time does he have left?  Before, like minimum.  We saw him for a little bit.  A few years.  That didn't work out well.  No, no.  They sent him back into his cell.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Oh, Jay.  Back to yourself.  That oatmeal cookie story from last year is one of my favorite stories.  I know you.  You're a murderer.  Yeah.  Do we have a clip from the oatmeal story?  The oatmeal.  If you've got something that's relatively short, I want to hear a part of that again.  It's a coincidence, because now my brain is oatmeal. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Oh, jeez.  The guy got away with a double homicide.  He couldn't behave.  You idiot.  Yeah, he couldn't behave.  You think after you kill your wife and her probable young lover, you should probably just  stay out of the fucking news for a while?  A little bit.  Maybe not fucking armed robbery.  Yeah.  He couldn't help himself.  No.  Unbelievable.  No.  All right.  Oh, so in honor of Mayor Menino, we played this as almost a throwaway the other day. 
[00:40:30]  I want to play it again.  It's us.  I am.  You know, this is how we say goodbye to some people that we know from this radio show.  Check it out.  I see what Travis did there.  First of all, this is one of my favorite Doors songs.  Can we just play this?  Oh, God.  Is this the loop?  Oh, that's right.  Ant doesn't like the Doors.  A little Peace Frog?  No?  No.  Man.  Blood in the streets?  Nothing?  Oh, wow.  Robbie Krieger is 68 years old today. 
[00:41:00]  Who is that?  He is one of the guys from the Doors.  The guitarist.  Ah.  Oh.  He's only 68.  My God.  Hmm.  I saw him in that tiny little bar on Long Island.  It had to be 20 years ago.  He looked like shit back then.  He's only 68?  That's a tough life right there.  I told you the story.  It was Robbie Krieger doing Doors songs. 
[00:41:30]  Mm-hmm.  Most of them just instrumentals.  I don't remember if he had a singer.  I don't think he did.  Yeah.  And the Islanders were playing.  It was a bar with a pool table.  Just one of these shitty places.  I think it's one of the shitty places you ended up playing.  I wound up playing that place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It might have fit a couple hundred people tops, but you all had to stand around.  There was a pool table.  The Islanders were on.  And there's Robbie Krieger of the Doors in the corner just playing.  Yeah.  This is fucked up.  Because I grew up a pretty big Doors fan. 
[00:42:00]  And I think I told you that the TV was louder.  So every time the Islanders scored, the place went nuts as Robbie Krieger is playing the guitar.  And I'm sitting there like, this is so fucked up.  Yeah.  You get done with a song to a polite smattering of applause.  And then in the middle of him doing a song, people are like, yeah.  Yeah.  Because the Islanders were playing.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm like, but he didn't give a fuck.  Nah, pay me.  He's seen it all.  He's like, whatever.  Just give me my money.  And then laughing Elvis in there because Elvis would have been 79 years old. 
[00:42:30]  It's not his birthday though, right?  What?  Today is his birthday?  Yeah.  If he would have been 79 years old.  Okay.  I got you.  They say, theoretically, someday he would have been.  Yeah, yes.  If he was still alive, he'd only be 79.  I say only because it seems like he's been dead our entire lives.  Yeah.  What's the Elvis channel doing today?  Something big?  Oh, Christ.  What's Graceland doing?  More great interviews, I hope.  Yeah, yeah.  More great interviews.  Remember those horrible things?  Can we put that on the docket that we have to check in with the Elvis channel? 
[00:43:00]  Can we go there now?  Yes.  Oh, let's go there now.  Where they talk to people that kind of knew the guy that sold the pair of shoes to Elvis.  They're running out of people to talk to because they're all dead.  So they find these obscure, yeah, all right, you said it.  Yeah.  These obscure, out-of-the-way people that barely had anything to do with the guy.  Every story just kind of withers and dies on the vine.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember one time Elvis came in a cracker barrel.  I thought he's probably going to get some eggs.  And my cook said, I don't know about that. 
[00:43:30]  Well, that's great.  So when you saw...  Oh, they're just playing music right now.  Oh, it's the end of a song.  Oh, this is...  All right, let's see what happens.  The Cheeker, George Klein, Elvis' old friend, every Friday here on Sirius X's Elvis Radio.  I'm Big Jim, waking you up from Memphis in for Argo this morning.  He'll be in later on this afternoon as we celebrate Elvis' birthday.  I remember as a child I used to hear...  Elvis had a million fucking songs.  Yep. 
[00:44:00]  And that guy has a classic radio voice.  Oh, yeah.  Who was that guy?  One of Elvis' friends just comes in and tells stories every week?  Every Friday.  They used to play that in the bathroom here.  It would drive me nuts because, like Jimmy said, these stories were about nothing and they would go on forever and ever.  I'd rather hear my own shit coming out of my ass.  They had a guy on that gave Elvis a pot when he was in the army so he could cook soup or something. 
[00:44:30]  And they went on for 20 minutes.  I'd love to hear that story.  The guy made it sound like they were roommates or something in the army or whatever.  And it wasn't.  It was just one of these things where Elvis just popped in because he needed like a...  I think it was a pot or a frying pan.  And they made 20 minutes out of it.  I've worked with you guys 20 hours a week for almost 10 years and I could do 40 minutes of open-ended stories unwrapped.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:45:00]  I'm obsessed with it, though.  Every once in a while I'll turn it on just to hear this complete utter nonsense.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't think the stories have strong minutes?  They're all gone.  The guys that have the real stories.  Hey, could you fill it up regular?  Thank you.  Right.  And there I was.  At one time at the Getty gas station.  Now, how much was gas back then?  Well, I got to tell you, I think it was 20 cents a guy.  Wow, 20 cents.  Now, did Elvis pay or did the colonel hand you the money? 
[00:45:30]  I do believe it was the colonel, but I can't be sure.  I lost my mind 30 years ago.  That's exactly what the channel is.  Is this song almost over?  The Elvis songs are short, right?  They are pretty short.  Huh?  It's still on.  It's still on?  You're monitoring it.  You're monitoring it.  Nice.  They give you who gives a shit facts like that anybody would, like they think are inside.  You know, when Elvis put a jacket on, if it was cold out, he'd button it.  You know, I heard that, but I had never seen it. 
[00:46:00]  Now, I saw him out in the cold once with an unbuttoned jacket.  Well, that's right.  From time to time, he would do that.  Oh, man.  What?  Oh, man.  As we wait, because, oh, oh.  Let's see.  Come on.  They're going right into another film.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, it's Friday as the story guy.  I hate these songs.  I mean, I like Elvis, but I'm not a fan of these. 
[00:46:30]  Now I bet it goes up.  Oh, it did.  Look at that.  Wow.  Now I bet it goes back down.  All right.  Let us know if they're telling Elvis stories from the past for his birthday.  Also, don't forget about the Opie and Anthony podcast.  We haven't been able to promote in like three weeks, but every Wednesday,  we throw an hour out there for the people, and it's a lot of the archives that we just  can't get to as much these days.  Yeah.  But this one is a special one.  We edited down the Super Show. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, well, that's a good one right there.  Come on.  We edited down the Super Show, and that is this week's podcast.  Dare we say, if you've never downloaded a podcast from us, that's the one.  Yeah, start with that one.  Yeah, start with that one.  And I believe it's on the docket to have Super Show 2.  Maybe you've got a friend that doesn't really listen to this program, and you don't even  know what to tell them about it.  There you go.  That's a good introduction.  We just want to be in the podcast world, period.  Why not?  You know, the podcast thing seems to be working for some people, so why not be in that world 
[00:47:30]  as well?  It's our friend Dean Cain there on Facebook.  I see that.  The links are on the Facebook page.  Yeah, on Facebook.com slash O&A show, and it's on iTunes, and it's everywhere.  I still get tweets.  How do I get the podcast?  What do they think?  I don't know.  I don't know what happens with some of these people.  Just get any podcasting app for any phone and search Opie and Anthony. 
[00:48:00]  If you have a smartphone, don't you know how to use it a little bit?  I'm not the greatest at it, certainly, but I can get around them.  At least the basics, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  I want to start listening to podcasts, so I just figured it out.  That's what you got to do.  Figure it out.  Went into an app store and said, oh, okay, I got a Samsung.  Let me see which one seems to work with my phone.  Okay.  Okay, sir.  I'll download this.  You know what?  I also enjoy the tutorial.  Boy, do I love a good tutorial when I'm trying to figure some shit out. 
[00:48:30]  But especially on a computer and a new program or something, you're like, how would I do  that?  And every fucking bit of information you need is somewhere out there like that.  And you just got to find it.  YouTube's great for that shit.  Yeah.  Video tutorials.  Video tutorials.  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  How to do this.  Right.  You know, I was trying to work my way around iMovie for a while there.  There you go.  It was like, how to put pic or whatever.  How do you do that?  And boom, a quick two-minute video. 
[00:49:00]  I'm like, oh, thank you.  And you're fucking flying through it.  Because in the end, I'm not tech savvy whatsoever.  I'm not that good.  But I can work my way around it a bit.  It's all out there.  When people ask where something is, hey, Anthony, where's that video that...  Just fucking search it.  If you put the exact thing you wrote to me in Google, it'll come up.  It's nuts.  It doesn't make any sense.  I'm still sending the pussy video.  Oh, right.  I'm fired, so fired.  And I got that today. 
[00:49:30]  Today, right?  Oh, you did?  Yeah, great.  How frustrating is the tutorial when they want you to drop down a menu that doesn't exist?  Like, you go through three steps and they're like, just look for, you know, manage entries.  What?  I don't have a manage entries.  I don't have that.  I'm not saying it's easy.  Then you've got to move on to another one.  Right.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's not easy, but at least, you know, give it a shot.  Yeah, yeah.  Get halfway through it and realize it's a fucking Windows tutorial.  You're on a Mac.  Oh, man.  What are you going to do?  So, every Wednesday, a brand new Opie and Anthony podcast.  About an hour.  Sometimes we go long form. 
[00:50:00]  This one might be a little long, I'm thinking.  Yeah, it's long.  So, this one might be pushing a couple hours.  Close.  It's probably like an hour, 30, hour, 40.  All right, good.  It was a great show.  Oh, my God.  That super show was amazing.  I can't wait to do another one.  We've got to find new weirdos.  Yeah.  To keep the super show concept going.  I loved it.  And then, as the vacation went on and got longer, it was like, wow, that was the last  show we did before vacation?  That's like three weeks.  We realized, yeah, we were like, wow, that was a long fucking time ago.  Yeah, that's a long time.  Certainly. 
[00:50:30]  Where are they at with Elvis?  Just more songs.  T-R-O-U-B-L-E is on right now.  What is that?  Oh, really?  Oh.  I want to hear a story.  I don't know if they're doing stories this morning.  They might not be doing stories this morning.  It's his birthday.  They have a birthday story.  Exactly.  They have to have a few good birthday stories.  One time, a woman sent over a cake for Elvis' birthday, and he went and blew on it, and 
[00:51:00]  it threw up.  A bunch of fucking barbiturates and shit come out on top of it.  A bunch of pills that hadn't even digested.  It looked like he had put sprinkles on the cake, all different colored pills, though.  He picked up a cake and threw it at a colored fella, and then bought the lady a Cadillac.  Bought the lady a Cadillac.  He died at 42, 43, 42.  I think 42.  Yeah, 42.  We're a bit older than that now, and it's safe to say we don't look like shit like he did 
[00:51:30]  at 42.  Holy fuck.  What did he do to himself?  He was living quite a fucking lifestyle there.  Living quite the rock and roll lifestyle.  Yeah.  We might have to move on to Nancy Grace, but I want to know the story.  Well, Sam will interrupt programming.  Yeah, you do that.  Yeah.  Mother of Alabama quarterback called racist for tweeting, am I listening to English during 
[00:52:00]  black players interview?  Oh, shit.  Is there audio of that?  Who said that?  The mother of the quarterback.  Of the Alabama quarterback.  But the Brent Musburger said that his girlfriend was hot?  That quarterback's mother.  Oh, shit.  Well, I got to tell you, I've listened to quite a few sports interviews, and it does seem  that grammar is just thrown right out the fucking window when you decide to become a sports  figure.  Well, these guys at these big schools don't really have to fucking, they don't really 
[00:52:30]  have to go to school.  It is a cultural thing also, I gather, because it transcends sports.  It goes into, you know, hip hop and just the drug culture and everything.  And you watch this show, like, maybe search.  And you'll see some baby mamas talking.  And it's like, yeah, yeah, he'd go there.  He'd go there.  And it's like, no, he went there.  Like, grammar just, and no one seems to care.  No one really seems to call anyone out on the fact, like, you're not speaking properly, 
[00:53:00]  and there's equity in speaking properly as far as getting a job and...  I don't think you're right.  No?  People do care.  The people that are...  It's very, very rare.  No, no, the people doing the hiring care.  Oh, right, yeah.  And that's the problem.  Yeah, but then they...  They don't care and all that, but they don't understand what they're doing to themselves.  Right.  Because they'll make up a thousand other reasons why they're not being hired, though.  You could get a million shitty jobs, but if you're really going for a real job or try  to get into a career path, the guys hiring really give a fuck about that stuff. 
[00:53:30]  You think they want to hear, that's what he'd do?  That's what he'd do!  They give a fuck?  No, no.  Maybe they don't care in the community or whatever, because they feel that's how their community  talks.  But then when you have an unemployment...  But the people doing the real hiring for real fucking nice jobs, they'd certainly give  a fuck.  When you have an unemployment rate double the national average, perhaps that's a reason.  Instead of just trying to throw that racist blanket over everything, maybe an employer 
[00:54:00]  doesn't want an employee that cannot speak the language properly.  And this woman, what is it, the mother of the quarterback?  Yeah.  She's absolutely right.  I've listened to interviews, and I've been like, what the fuck is this guy saying?  Can we hear this guy's interview?  Why?  I mean, she's called a racist for that?  I'm taking this thing about the best man here in town, all that.  I'm just glad my family's here with me.  I just want to see my family.  Tell them, hey, Alabama boy got him a national championship.  I'm pretty sure Alabama's going to try to keep it in the state somehow. 
[00:54:30]  But Florida State, the national championship.  How's it feel to get a championship on your heart to take a shot?  It feels great.  Right now, my birthday is irrelevant, because I'm a champion now.  We're champions.  I don't even care about my birthday, man.  But it was a pretty good birthday present.  It's the best birthday present I've had in my life.  There's no reason to pay.  Is that the clip?  That couldn't be the clip.  That couldn't be the clip, because that's not bad.  It's not bad.  But let me tell you, it's not fine.  It's not bad.  But he's fucking up a lot of words. 
[00:55:00]  I think it's closer to fine.  Yeah, that's more of a southern accent, too.  That's how guys the deep south talk, man.  That's a deep southern.  That can't be the clip.  There's no way.  I would never hear that and think this guy's butchering the language.  We face no adversity.  We face so much adversity the past two months.  I mean, with me, with Coach Fisher, I mean, with a lot of people on our team, we face a lot of adversity.  If that's the clip, there's nothing wrong with this.  Yeah, I was ready to defend the mom here, but there's nothing really wrong. 
[00:55:30]  If that's the clip, she's kind of wrong.  I mean, nothing really big.  Wait, did they beat her son's team?  Perhaps that's not.  Alabama beat Florida?  Is that what it was?  No.  Yes.  Okay, so maybe she was just beating up.  Hang on, I'm saying the clip right now.  Oh, you have it.  This might be it.  Oh, different guy.  Yes, that's it.  All right, here we go.  All right, so the mother, let me set it up again.  Mother of Alabama quarterback called racist for tweeting,  am I listening to English during black players' interview?  And it's this interview.  15 to go in this game. 
[00:56:00]  Final drive.  What did you tell your teammates around you?  I said, guys, we didn't come here for no reason.  I said, guys, this is ours, man.  This is ours.  All the adversity we went through the first few quarters, it was ours to take.  And like I was just saying, we control our own destiny.  And those men looked me in my eye and they said, we got this, Jameis.  And I said, we said, I said, are you strong?  They said, I'm strong if you're strong.  And I said, we're strong, man.  After struggling through the first half,  what was the biggest adjustment you guys made at halftime? 
[00:56:30]  We had to go back to playing Florida State football.  We came out here.  We were letting us be bigger than the game.  We were bigger than the game.  Then we had to say, hey, let's play Florida State football  because can't nobody be bigger than this game.  And we did that.  And we came out victorious.  You had an embrace with your head coach, Jimbo Fisher.  It's not that bad, but if some white guy got up there and said,  can't nobody get it, it would be like, why is this guy speaking like this?  We were champions together.  And through everything that we went through, through all the haters,  through every single thing, we came out victorious. 
[00:57:00]  And God did this.  I'm so blessed.  He's so blessed.  All the stuff that he handled with Ethan.  That's not bad.  The mom's wrong.  Bitch.  Yeah, the mom's wrong.  Period.  It's a nice interview he's giving.  It's not bad, but there's an acceptance of poor grammar when it comes to...  I don't think there was much going on there at all.  The girlfriend can't be...  The girlfriend's also in trouble.  What did she do?  She favorited a tweet that said he needs to learn sign language to communicate  because listening to him attempt to speak English is just insulting. 
[00:57:30]  Hold on, though.  Is that the guy?  We're also getting reports that isn't the clip.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I want to hear a clip where the guy just easily ooblies his way through a fucking interview.  I got to get fucking Alan Keyes speaking.  Let's say hi to Tony in Dallas.  Tony, that's not the clip.  No, that's not.  They've been playing it on the sports stations right here.  And the guy sounds like he's speaking in tongue or if it's like an ebonics or something.  I want to hear it.  All right.  We do radio.  Where is this clip?  The Bande Estat El Clipo. 
[00:58:00]  Well, I know it's about three different stations down here have been playing it,  so it's out there somewhere.  What's his name?  I don't even know his name.  That's the clip that's linked to every article.  Is it?  Yeah.  It was a day ago.  I mean, that's the FSU winning.  Tony, that's the clip that's on the Daily News, the Huffington Post.  Huh.  I guess someone's now saying that definitely is the clip.  That's him.  Either way.  Hold on a minute.  I'm putting you on with Mike in Florida.  Hold on, Tony in Dallas.  Go ahead, Mike.  You're on with Tony. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm a Florida State fan.  I watch literally every game.  I watch every minute of the national championship.  The one that you just played where he's talking about being strong in God  and being so blessed, that is absolutely the clip that the mother was referring to  because he sounds as ghetto as could possibly be.  But it's real, like you guys said, it's not the best.  I didn't even hear a lot of ghetto.  No, no.  He sounds like a humble guy.  I got to go against the mom on this one.  She sounds like she's being a little picky or something.  Or just being a racist, just being a bitch. 
[00:59:00]  There were some grammar errors in there.  Yeah, but I mean, nothing over the top.  Can't be?  Huh?  He can't be?  Can't be?  That guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  Yeah, grammar, but I mean, again, guys, part of that is not the shit on people from the South,  but there are people from the South who, you know.  I understand, but there is more of an acceptance of poor grammar in the black community  than there is any other community in this country.  I agree with you, but I don't think it's happening. 
[00:59:30]  I don't think.  No, no, it's not this case.  There's two different things going on.  This case is ridiculous.  You're right.  Yeah, I didn't really see anything out of the ordinary there, over-the-top crazy.  I'll tell you off the air at what station, if you want to see if you can grab it.  Yeah, off the air.  We'll tell them.  Maybe we'll grab their feet or something.  Everyone's saying the clip we played is the clip now.  Of course it's the clip.  All right?  It is the clip.  And what I was going to say, it wasn't that.  It was the work that he did, but still, I agree with you guys.  It wasn't that bad.  But I think that his mom is just mad because she thinks her son, like that team, Alabama, 
[01:00:00]  they were told all year they were the best team, and they were going to be in the national  championship.  Your son.  So she's just being a cunt.  Right.  There was nothing wrong with that clip.  But maybe, do we hear the whole thing?  Is there anything at the end we missed?  Watch at the end, he just fucking goes like De Niro with the other kids here.  I'm in the head.  Just fucking drowning.  Go to the end.  Just to be on the same side.  His hat looks silly.  I'll say that.  He came out to be two.  And God did this.  I'm so blessed.  He's so blessed.  All the stuff that he handled with Ethan, and he come out here and coached us, that tests 
[01:00:30]  me.  And there's nobody but God.  There's nobody.  Ethan being the reference to Jimbo's son, you said it once, you said it a hundred times  this season.  If we're going to do it big, we're going to do it big then.  Oh.  Is that it?  It's buffering, but there's very little left to it.  It's buffering.  She's just mad that her son was on the opposing team.  And he seems like a nice guy.  He has a humble interview.  She a hater.  But now this goes to Anthony's point.  We got a teacher, excuse me, that teaches in the ghetto. 
[01:01:00]  In the ghetto.  Tom in Jersey.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I've been a teacher for a few years.  I teach predominantly African-Americans.  A lot of gang members and stuff get sent to our school and was actually told by my supervisor  after I was trying to stress the point, hey, you go to a job interview, you've got to speak  correctly, I was pulled into the office and told, we're not here to teach these kids how to speak 
[01:01:30]  correctly.  Teach them the information that you need to, but that it's a culture thing, it's ingrained,  and we are not here to, quote-unquote, fix that.  There we go.  And we're called Shape Up.  Shape Up.  Shape Up.  It's unbelievable.  And they said, shape up, yo.  But in a school, you should be teaching the proper way to do things, and then if you want  to do it differently, it's so good.  This guy's like, here's the tools.  Right.  Here's how you use them.  That's what this guy is saying that his superiors say.  You give them the tools, you show them how to use them, and then you throw them out 
[01:02:00]  there, and you're on your own, kid.  That's what paternalism gets in the way of actually practically teaching and doing a job.  Yeah.  Michigan State player might be the one they're playing, talking about, the clip is a defensive  player.  Ken in Jersey, Ken.  Hello.  Hi.  Ken.  No, you're on the air.  Hello, buddy.  You.  Anyone.  I guess not.  People are still debating if that's the clip or not. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  I kind of want it to be the clip so I can dislike the mother, and I kind of don't want  it to be the clip because she couldn't.  Because it'll be funny to hear.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  But that's the clip that's linked to all the stories, right?  Yes.  Am I listening to English?  Yeah, okay.  That's what she says.  And then the attractive daughter got into it, too?  Yeah, she favorited somebody else's tweet.  And then she tweeted that I accidentally favorited them. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, God.  Shut up.  I've accidentally favorited tweets, though.  Have you?  Yeah.  When you're going to do something else, a copy or whatever.  Yeah.  I'm trying to retweet.  That's a little...  That's a little...  You know what?  She's hot enough to not be blamed.  I guess it depends on how hot they are.  If you're going to accept their excuse.  Yeah, right.  In fucking...  In cases where the teacher's fucking the students, it's all about how hot they are.  Absolutely.  It's just, you know, the hotness will... 
[01:03:30]  Hotness will get your place.  Right.  If she's over 140, then she's just a racist.  If she's under 140, the poor delicate thing, her fingers must have hit the favorite button.  Where are we at with Elvis?  Any stories?  No.  Songs.  More songs?  Yeah.  This is one of these.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[01:04:00]  He's got a lot of songs, but a lot of his songs have the same basic sound.  You can put them...  Well, it was the time.  Yeah, it was the time.  You didn't get the opportunity to move forward with...  Not really.  Other styles.  You think if Elvis was live, he would have done some kind of rap song?  Oh, God, that would have been great.  Falling into that shit.  Freestyling on Arsenio.  He probably would have done it in the 80s when Blondie did it.  That's true.  Although he was around for the disco. 
[01:04:30]  The disco was hitting as Elvis was croaking.  Did Elvis go down the disco road at any point in his career?  A little disco, just a little different beat in the background?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  He did a great cover of Willie Nelson to all...  Which one was it?  I forget, but he's wearing the big, dark glasses.  It's that era of his life where he has those giant sunglasses and the towel draped over  and tucked in to a sweatsuit, zipped up fucking thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To all the girls I've loved before, I think he covered.  When did he start wearing the jumpsuits? 
[01:05:00]  The jumpsuits.  Because that had to be so strange for everyone when he first came out with that.  Like, what are you doing?  The thing is, he got so popular in Vegas that they put on these giant fucking shows  with a lot of lights and...  Oh, so you had to have...  Yeah, he got, you know, all Vegas-y.  He got caught up in that.  Mm-hmm.  Had to be a little more showy.  That was right.  Oh, my home.  What's the Willie Nelson...  I'm wrong.  It's not that one.  He covered a Willie Nelson song.  All the girls I've loved before. 
[01:05:30]  No.  It was a really nice song, I think, to his wife he sang it, or...  Always On My Mind.  I'm sorry.  I mean, Always On My Mind.  Yes.  You're always on my mind.  Elvis' version is a lot better.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, if we hear...  Happy birthday, Elvis.  Can't you say that?  We got to hear a little bit of that.  Travis in there fucking looking for some Pearl Jam.  Why don't you stop it?  Oh, Christ.  Enough with a Pearl Jam.  Maybe I didn't treat you...  Quite as good as I should have 
[01:06:00]  Maybe I didn't love you  Quite as awful as I could have  Turn it up there  Little things I should have said and done  I just never...  There you go.  There it comes.  You were always on my mind 
[01:06:30]  Always on my mind  You were always on my mind  Yeah, that ain't too shabby.  Yeah, I like that cover.  Not bad.  Maybe I...  If that's, you know, your kind of thing.  Yeah.  Well, you need nice, pleasant music?  It is.  Sure.  He covered Sweet Caroline.  I love a good Elvis cover.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Her unique sound, that Elvis voice.  A little over the top, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Last Chance with Elvis.  Any stories?  No.  Man, what are they doing over there?  They're just playing Elvis songs. 
[01:07:00]  This is what drives me nuts about radio.  So then what is the guy doing now?  And he gets paid?  He's probably not there.  He probably taped it.  You think?  He's...  Voice tracked it.  Well, they got to do something from...  They got to do something from Graceland, right?  Of course.  It's his big birthday show.  That's like a big event.  I don't think they let him into Graceland until a little later.  Yeah.  They're like, enough of this Elvis shit.  We're trying to sleep.  That's...  We'll open the doors at 8 for you so you can do your Elvis nonsense.  I guess...  I think you're right.  It is still kind of early.  I think... 
[01:07:30]  I think they do start at 8 or something like that.  What does the schedule say?  You know what we'll do?  We'll take a break here.  We're going to figure out the Elvis story thing because we need at least one Elvis story for  his birthday.  A good story.  We're going to take a little break and then we'll be back.  Whoa.  Watch out, search.  How about one guy that tells us...  Oh, because you're a freestyler.  I know.  I was freestyling.  You turned around and looked at the TV like search was on TV.  Search is on?  How did I miss a tone?  Oh, I was telling search, watch out. 
[01:08:00]  He's got competition in the freestyling world.  Look out.  And Nancy Grace is just a big, fat fucking pig and saying stupid shit.  And we got our latest stupid shit for everybody next.  That should be in her intro, by the way.  Yeah.  What you just said.  She is so hateable.  Yeah, she is.  I don't really know...  In my world, I don't know one person that likes this lady.  No.  Not a one, but she gets the numbers because she's still on TV.  So, what's her fan base? 
[01:08:30]  Women who don't like women that kill their children.  So, a lot of mommies.  Sticks in the mud.  Sticks in the mud.  I think it's also people who feel completely powerless feel like she's getting something done.  Yeah.  She's speaking truth to power or she's going after the bad guys.  Yeah, she's going after tot mom.  She sounds like she's getting shit done and she's tough as nails, but she just stinks.  And she wears, like, a necklace that are handcuffs. 
[01:09:00]  Have you...  Oh, no!  Does she?  Look out.  Ew.  She's fucking...  Have you seen that?  I think you could buy them on her...  Don't run out justice.  ...on her website.  Yeah.  Little necklace and has little tiny little handcuffs because, you know, she's getting people arrested.  Their perpetually stuffy nose.  I wish her necklace looked like a noose.  We got a lot of things to figure out, so we'll step aside here and we'll rejoin you guys in a minute. 
[01:09:30]  What's going on with the Dennis Rodman thing?  Anything else?  Have they played that game yet?  I don't think so.  They had Dennis Rodman on all the news channels last night doing a little exchange and shit.  Fucking loser.  You're just an asshole.  He always has been an asshole, but now he's really up in his assholery.  Now, if the mother of the football player would have commented on his speech, that would have been good.  Yeah.  The guy he's with does a good job of clarifying. 
[01:10:00]  That's the guy that should be the spokesman for the group.  That sucks, though.  He's got to sit there and be embarrassed.  You know he's embarrassed.  Those players are embarrassed.  Yeah.  They're sitting there going, man, fuck, why did my life go so wrong that I have to hang out with Dennis Rodman in North Korea?  North Korea.  Where did my career take a turn?  The fuck?  Ex-NBA players are doing much better than this shit.  The fuck?  And then is he allowed to win the game over there?  Because obviously... 
[01:10:30]  It was a tie last time, I think.  No.  I think when they first played, it was a tie.  Oh, you think they're going to have to throw the game?  Of course they have to.  Or else, you know...  That guy's a madman.  Or else, well, you're playing.  There's a problem with your playing.  I'm telling you, I'm just hoping that, you know, a little switch goes off in that Kim John...  He's head.  And he feeds him to the dogs.  I would laugh my ass off.  That would be fun.  That would be a great work.  A little flip.  He'd be like, what?  I thought we were friends. 
[01:11:00]  I don't like you anymore.  Don't do the Asian accent.  You know what happens.  Be careful with that.  I know.  Even though you kind of sound that way, you're not allowed to point that out to the people.  You can't point out that there is...  There are different accents in the world.  Right.  And if you want to imitate somebody that has a certain accent, you're really not allowed to do it anymore.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  Embrace diversity, but don't point it out in humor. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, do not point it out in humor.  Especially in humor.  I saw somebody's post the other day.  It said it was a guy, and he was with his wife, who was of some type of exotic ethnic background.  And their kids were all around the gentleman, and he was white.  And it said, diversity, assuring that your kids will not look like you.  I got a chuckle out of it. 
[01:12:00]  Did you?  Yeah, I guess which website.  I just figured I know that.  Yeah.  So that's all we got on Rodman.  Maybe he plays today.  Maybe.  There was a story on the Associated Press yesterday that a lot of those players are kind of having second thoughts.  Of course.  You know what, they're dummies then.  What do you think?  There's a lot of criticism, and now they're just kind of having second thoughts.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're going to all just have hell to pay when they come back. 
[01:12:30]  They'll all be doing interviews and stuff, though.  They're probably just scared, like, why is this dumbbell our spokesman?  Oh, my God.  He's going to get them all eaten by dogs.  But then you come back, and if everything goes well over there anyway, you come back, and you're kind of a scourge.  Dude, he executed his own uncle, okay?  Yeah.  It's going to go bad with Dennis Rodman.  Rodman's going to say something stupid, and that's all it's going to take.  Yeah.  Or this guy's going to be convinced that Dennis Rodman's trying to be the leader of North Korea. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you keep coming back?  Right.  He's got to kill him.  It's going to be paranoid, and something's going to happen.  Maybe not this visit, but maybe the next one.  He's going to get drunk and pick up Kim Jong-un, you tiny little motherfucker, and run around with him.  Looked like a gnome and shit.  I just see it going horribly wrong in some way.  Oh, man.  Let me, let's see who this is.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, this is Bob.  You guys were trying to call me yesterday. 
[01:13:30]  You guys are trying to call me yesterday.  Did he actually just...  I called in to this show to...  What do you want, dude?  What?  You're on the air.  Go.  I got a message out, although someone, I guess, whoever it was that answers the phones was trying to call me, I guess. 
[01:14:00]  Who knows?  This is today.  That was yesterday.  Let it go.  Yesterday is yesterday.  When you do a show...  This is my favorite bit.  It's...  This is my favorite bit.  Like, maybe it was pertinent yesterday.  Well, you know what?  You know, we're talking about North Korea.  What the hell?  You're on the phone.  You might as well give us what you got on that.  Go.  Maybe we could do that?  Go ahead.  Dennis Rodman.  That North Korean guy, he sounds like someone who would be upset if he didn't get around on Wednesday. 
[01:14:30]  He'd just freaking kill every freaking woman that didn't well him on Wednesday.  You know, I'll say this.  The fact that you tried to tie it into the show kind of makes me want to drown you in a tub.  But he's not wrong about Kim Jong-un.  So, you've got to give him half credit.  That Korea guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that Korea guy. 
[01:15:00]  But usually when you catch an absolute blithering idiot off the line, they have nothing.  At least thematically he was correct.  I had heard that Bobo did have an Elvis story.  Oh, yeah.  We're talking about Elvis.  You've got an Elvis story because Elvis would have been 79 today, Bobo.  Yeah.  No, there is an Elvis story, right?  My mother wanted tickets to see him in the garden years ago in the 70s, but my grandfather wouldn't give her tickets.  Why not? 
[01:15:30]  She was younger.  Who knows?  Because he was supposedly, according to my mother, my grandfather was one of those guys that, you know, one of those guys that they rock and roll with devil music.  Oh, shit.  Uh-huh.  So, wouldn't let her go see Elvis.  I got to defend Bobo.  That was better than most of the Elvis stories I've heard on the Elvis channel.  As a matter of fact, I'm looking in the booth.  The Elvis channel is trying to get in touch with Bobo.  So, they can throw that story on their channel. 
[01:16:00]  Do you have an Elvis story?  Yeah.  Mr. Baluda gets licked, fried banana, and peanut butter off my mother's vagina.  You know, speaking of the weirdos, the freaks of our radio show.  Oh, yes.  Have you noticed how many Marion Twitter accounts are popping up?  There are so many freaking Marion accounts now.  And they're all just like, hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  She made the mistake of calling to try to say that she's not on Twitter.  Yeah.  So, now there's even more Marion Twitter accounts. 
[01:16:30]  That's great.  Anything else, Bobo?  We got a show to do here.  Bobo, anything else?  Current events?  What do you got?  What about the cold?  What about the cold weather?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, let us know about your experiences.  What is it?  The polar vortex.  Polar vortex.  What's going on?  What do you got on the polar vortex?  Well, it's that cold even.  Even my dogs don't like it when they're outside.  And they usually love going outside.  They freaking want to run inside as soon as they go outside. 
[01:17:00]  He's two for two with accurate information.  His dogs do not like the cold.  Tell us a cold story.  And he left good-naturedly.  Even the little rugrats don't like it when I take him out for a walk.  It's probably also so cold that probably no one wants to commit crimes in Detroit.  Why did you have to ruin everything?  Yeah.  And you've got to wonder what Bobo's opinion is on what's going on in Colorado right now. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  You a pothead, Bobo?  What about the pot there in Colorado, Bobo?  Oh, well, I have to say that's increasing the amount of flights to Colorado.  Home run, Daniel.  Wow.  Fucking home run.  I went to LaGuardia Airport, and I couldn't even get a flight to Colorado.  Just like Voss, you always get greedy.  You know, you had a home run, and then you got greedy.  I thought you were going to compare IQs.  No, no, no.  Just like Voss, you're a high school dropout who blew people for drugs, and then for no reason. 
[01:18:00]  And then that person in LaGuardia that I tried to buy the flight ticket from said,  Oh, I live in New Jersey.  Here's a drive down there.  Here's my card.  My medicinal marijuana card.  Holy shit.  Who, you Rodney Dunderhead?  I couldn't get a flight.  But if the guy already had a way to get his marijuana, why would he go to Colorado to get the marijuana?  I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  Hello?  Of course, they said the whole joke.  He would go to Colorado and get the marijuana, but he couldn't get there.  The guy probably, because of that whole medicinal marijuana thing, just give him a card where it is legal.  It's the nuances.  Then why would he try to go to Colorado in the first place?  Why not just stay local and get your weed locally?  Pretty much the same stuff.  Yeah.  You don't need a medicinal marijuana card in Colorado. 
[01:19:00]  But he has the medicinal marijuana card.  So he's gone through the red tape.  He has the card, which means he can get marijuana in New Jersey.  So why would he give that privilege up to get on a plane to go to Colorado to get the marijuana?  What Opie's trying to say is, what the fuck are you talking about?  I kind of mix the whole thing as a joke.  Oh, a joke.  Oh, that was a joke.  That's right.  That's good.  I didn't realize it sounded like a Nazi statement in Nuremberg.  Thank you for having no humor. 
[01:19:30]  All right, Bobo.  So that was great.  All right.  You guys have a good day.  Defeated.  That was actually better.  Let's say hi to Eric in Dallas.  Eric.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How are you doing?  I'm doing all right, brother.  All right.  First off, I'm just saying, man, I've been a huge fan of y'all since the AAF days when I lived in Boston at the time.  So it's an honor to talk to you.  I should have lost that accent.  What I wanted to, I was reading the back story on the Kim Jong-un killing his uncle thing a couple of days ago. 
[01:20:00]  And the back story to that was that his uncle owned the fisheries in the North Korea area, and he was wanting, which is the second largest economic form of income.  And the Kim Jong-un blamed him for all the pussy smell.  Yeah.  He'd take a product and hit the girl in underpants.  So anyway, Kim Jong-un wanted, his uncle wanted to take over the coal mines, which is the number one source of revenue for the country of North Korea. 
[01:20:30]  And his uncle had a group of elite military force that actually helped him protect him.  Well, Kim Jong-un sent his military in to take the coal mines back, and apparently Kim Jong-un's small elite force pretty much annihilated the North Korean army.  Is this a new game I could get for Xbox One? 
[01:21:00]  That's what it sounds like.  So wait a minute, the uncle was fucking around.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was planning some big fucking shenanigans.  Okay.  So when it was all said and done, Kim Jong-un basically had to send four military guys to one of his elite members to take him out.  And then they took him, and that's why they had killed him, was because he was trying to take over basically the main source of income into the country.  Wait, you said it almost wrong.  So Kim Jong-un had the regular military.  The uncle had the elite guys.  Yes.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[01:21:30]  He had this group of elite mercenaries that were protecting him and basically helping him to further his agenda.  Fuck, I didn't know that.  All right, we learned something today.  Yeah, and if he takes over that shit, then he pretty much was trying to take over the country.  Yeah, and Kim Jong-un wouldn't have none of that shit.  This is going to be a coup or something, you've got to think, right?  Coup.  I don't know now.  He really puts the kibosh on that idea quickly.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, you might rethink things.  Right. 
[01:22:00]  All right, gentlemen, thank you so much for taking my call, and y'all have a great day.  Oh, wow.  Polite.  Very polite.  I'm very uncomfortable when people are so nice and pleasant.  And informed.  No, you have a better day to say no game.  Sorry, I learned that.  That was kind of nice, though.  That guy was just, you know, a normal dude with some nice info.  Yeah, a little info.  Some pleasantries.  Let me give this to you.  Some compliments.  Yeah.  That was a nice call.  Elvis stories?  You're not even monitoring it anymore. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, fuck.  I have it up here, and I'm looking at the cover arts.  Oh, boy.  They're just doing songs.  They probably fired the Elvis guys.  Hopefully.  But they were the best.  The stories were amazing.  Nancy Grace.  All right.  She had this to say.  I think most people know by now.  Yes.  But I actually haven't heard the clip.  I haven't neither.  I read the stories and stuff, but here's the actual clip of it going down.  Do you want your cab driver to be high on pot? 
[01:23:00]  But I think that's one issue.  How about your airplane pilot?  What about that?  Hang on.  But on the other side, I was talking to a tour operator.  Obviously, he was three.  She realized a lot of airplane pilots are fucking drunk or hungover.  A lot of them drink, man.  A lot.  And I think if they do it now, they're not just going to start because it's illegal somewhere.  And there are still restrictions.  People are like, just because it's legal doesn't mean you could do it anywhere, anytime. 
[01:23:30]  You know, you could get fired for your job for coming in high.  Is there a field test?  Yeah, they figured something out.  They figured some tests out.  They did, right?  Yeah, for THC.  So it'll be just like alcohol and everything else.  Yeah.  But at least if your cab driver is on pot, you know he's...  A little mellow?  A little more mellow.  He's not going to be going 100 miles an hour.  It does mellow you out a little bit.  Chills you out a bit.  But your reactions are a little slower.  That's been proven. 
[01:24:00]  Thrilled at the legalization, recreationally speaking, in Colorado specifically.  And he would argue, you know, listen, if you do it responsibly, you don't get behind the wheel.  You do it in a private, confined space.  You do it safely.  No harm, no foul.  You mean a private space like your home where you're supposed to be taking care of your children?  Oh, God.  Or cooking at a gas stove?  What?  Or lighting a fireplace?  You mean that place?  Yeah, no.  That's going to happen.  Not a good idea.  What about drinking? 
[01:24:30]  She's just a pig looking for attention.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's a fucking pig.  You could do pretty much all those things with a little pot in your system, by the way.  She's like that episode of fucking Dragnet, the old one, where the girl was babysitting the baby.  Right.  And she smoked a little weed, right?  And then the parents come home, and they go to see their baby.  And they go upstairs, and they pull a little blankie down, and the mother screams.  She screams, oh, no, there's a turkey, a turkey in the fucking little bassinet thing there. 
[01:25:00]  What the fuck?  I know.  So then the mother's like, what's it?  Where's my baby?  Where's my baby?  She goes, it's in the bassinet.  And I've also cooked you a wonderful turkey.  It's in the oven.  Oh, man.  When you made it, the fucking baby's in the oven?  Exactly, Chippa.  Fucking hilarious.  Yes.  Double guns.  See what pot will do?  That's the evil weed.  We have to go back to the phones, because we're getting the last guy was full of shit. 
[01:25:30]  You know, the pleasant guy?  Yeah.  The nice caller.  Can we just talk to?  Josh.  Yeah.  Come on in, boys.  Hey.  My last guy was full of shit.  Are you just saying it, I guess?  I was talking about Bobo.  Oh.  Oh, see.  Oh, man.  See, I don't like when people are forcing the bit.  I know.  They catch on.  Because we get plenty of people doing it for real.  Uh-huh.  Where they get mad at the caller and feel like he has all misinformation.  Yeah.  Nancy Grace. 
[01:26:00]  What?  The question for Nancy Grace, if they're on pot instead of alcohol, then a lot of people  are getting, you know, not getting beaten at home.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What about that angle?  I mean, yeah.  She's saying nothing about alcohol, which anything she's mentioned could be harmed or  you could have an accident or something if you're drinking.  Alcohol is a motherfucker.  But it's just like we said before the show, we're talking a little bit.  I mean, the whole world has just accepted alcohol as being okay. 
[01:26:30]  It's not okay in the end.  It's just not okay.  It's pretty bad stuff.  It's horrendous.  It sort of impairs your judgment.  A lot of people, a lot of shit goes down because of alcohol.  A lot.  Yeah.  A lot of fat girls get fucked, though.  Oh, that's true.  You tell them, Jimmy.  That's true.  Or lighting a fireplace.  You mean that place?  You can't light a fireplace where you're stolen?  Okay.  Let's get the matches out.  When I'm at work, I don't want my babysitter high on pot. 
[01:27:00]  This isn't the babies.  How are you always with the fucking babies?  Shut up with your baby.  You know, there's people that don't even have kids that might want to sit at home and fucking  drink and pet their cat.  But that's up to the parent.  Right.  You would know if the person that is trying to babysit your kids, if she's smoking too  much pot or not.  Just know.  What's she talking about?  Up.  All right.  Does anybody?  Do you want your children? 
[01:27:30]  Do you want your parents, your sister, your brother to be taken care of or driven around  by somebody on pot because it's okay in Colorado?  You know what?  Colorado gets what he asked for.  I know people are screaming at the television agreeing with you.  I'm sure.  And vehemently disagreeing with you.  Hey, look.  The ones that are disagreeing are lethargic sitting on the sofa eating chips.  Oh, that is a bad statement in the grade.  There.  And people have pumped it up and said fat and lazy.  She said it at the end.  She said it.  Oh, she just said it? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, fat and lazy.  Oh, okay.  I heard lethargic.  That, uh...  Was it when he was doing the chip thing?  Oh.  He's right there.  Yeah.  That's a ridiculous statement that she's making.  It's...  It's...  It is.  It's so stupid.  Just because something is legally available doesn't mean you do it all the time when you're  supposed to be, you know, responsible.  That's what they need to think.  The people that aren't going to be responsible with the weed are the ones that have been getting  it illegally for a long time. 
[01:28:30]  What are you talking about?  I mean, even shit like fucking NyQuil.  You know, NyQuil's available over the counter and shit like that.  And you're not supposed to be taking that and driving around.  NyQuil's a motherfucker.  So what the...  You know, does she have a problem with everything that could possibly impair your judgment?  Because it's out there and there are children out there?  She's an idiot.  She's a fucking idiot.  Her hashtags are stupid.  I'm sending her one right now.  Are you good?  And the hashtag is tabloidoinker.  Ah, nice. 
[01:29:00]  Good for you.  I just find it strange because our whole lives, Pop, was such an evil thing.  And to live long enough to see it legalized is so weird to me.  I'm not saying it's wrong.  I don't know how to feel.  It's just strange.  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  I mean, we were told growing up, man, that was some evil shit.  I know.  I'm very curious as to why they fucking...  Like, who's in charge of it in Colorado? 
[01:29:30]  I don't think the FDA can step in on a...  Because federally, it's still illegal to sell weed.  Federally, they can go to Colorado and arrest people.  Yeah, they've said they're not going to do anything like that.  Federally.  But I know the FDA, they make sure the food and drugs in this country are looked after and graded and whatnot.  And, like, who's doing that in Colorado?  Who's looking over it?  Who's making sure that if you're selling weed, it's sanitary?  And if you're selling weed products, that there's some kind of nutritional value that needs to be in there? 
[01:30:00]  Maybe I don't...  Like, what about the warnings for people that are taking it home and maybe have kids or animals?  Like, who's taking care of that end of it?  Did they set up a committee or something?  I don't know.  That's just it.  They had to set up something.  I have no idea.  On the state level?  Uh, let's go to Harry in Nevada.  What's up, Harry?  Nice hat, Harry.  How are you, guys?  Love listening to you. 
[01:30:30]  Of course you do.  Nancy Grace is a fucking stupid cut.  See ya.  All right, good point, Harry.  Well said.  Harry.  Somebody had to say it.  That's right.  Well, why is this...  It was well said by Harry, I think.  Yeah.  Concise and accurate.  Well, I don't think a lot of people are going to disagree with you, but...  Yeah.  It was far from controversial.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Far.  Yeah?  Hmm.  No one else with information as to...  Not really.  ...who's taking care of all the... 
[01:31:00]  There's two Elvis stories.  I'm a police officer in Ohio, and I'm for the legalization of pot.  Hmm.  I might have an Elvis story.  Oh.  ...was at his home for Sam Phillips and recommended Elvis to Sam, and what happened next?  I called Sam after Elvis left and told him what I thought.  He said, well, I'll call him and ask if he will come in tomorrow night, which is Wendy.  He said, you and Bill come in and put a little music behind him.  I just want to see what he sounds like on tape. 
[01:31:30]  Two, three times through it, and we had the first record.  What happened next?  Sam transferred the tape to a disc, and he took the disc down to...  Dewey Phillips, who was no relation to Sam, but Dewey had a nighttime R&B radio show.  Right.  I'm not thinking with you, yeah.  What you working with Dewey?  Seven degrees away from Elvis.  I was around, yeah.  Right.  Because I guess they called Elvis' mother again because he would have been out.  But they got Elvis down to the radio show and said he was going to be interviewed.  And he talked to Dewey for quite a while. 
[01:32:00]  Elvis told him to go...  Asked him, what are you going to interview?  And Dewey told him, well, I just did.  And he didn't get the Michael Ball at times.  Stay tuned for a moment.  Wow.  Punch out.  Celebrity hotline.  And hear the entire long-form interviews.  During George's Friday afternoon show.  That was the edited version.  Wow.  I really want to know more.  But it's exactly what we talk about.  I do want to know more.  Yeah, that was...  That guy that was talking, as far as I was concerned from that interview, had never met Elvis. 
[01:32:30]  And that was the edited version.  They felt like they needed to say that then they transferred the tapes over to this form  and then sent it down to the station.  Yeah, I think that closest...  You would have left all that out if you had a really good story there.  I think the closest he got to Elvis was he called a guy...  Right.  ...that was speaking with Elvis right after Elvis left.  Right.  That's that guy's connection to Elvis.  Right.  Well, they didn't disappoint.  No.  Those Elvis stories are just amazing. 
[01:33:00]  Good story.  Good story.  I'm waiting for more Nancy Gray stuff.  But we got this guy, Frank of Long Island, who has something on the FDA thing.  Frank.  I am.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, we said the FDA won't review marijuana for nutritional value or for treating anything  because it's a natural supplement.  Just like if you go into TNC, most of the things they have in there that are natural...  I am.  ...are not going to be reviewed by the FDA.  What about cookies and stuff?  If you're in Colorado, how do you know that it's not sprinkled with a little angel dust? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, or don't they put stuff in it, right?  Paraquat.  Yeah, a little...  Paraquat.  Or just one quad.  The great...  You just have to hope to get lucky.  All right.  Punch it out.  I don't know.  I'm expecting a...  I'd like to talk to Colorado about this, but they're still sleeping because you see...  Yeah, it just seems to me that any kind of thing that's put out there for the consumer has all  these little safety checks on there and they...  Right. 
[01:34:00]  But...  And especially something that's used as a recreational drug.  You would think that would definitely happen.  This guy wants to talk about weed stocks.  Nice.  Is there an actual company at that?  Is it 69 or 94?  No, that's what they'd put you in when you were bad.  Yes.  Weed stocks.  Derek in Chicago.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just stumbled upon that marijuana stocks, like in October, I found them. 
[01:34:30]  Actually, they're making pretty good gains.  They're penny stocks right now, but most of them should move up to the down aspect by April.  So just check it out.  I highly recommend it.  Get it?  I got it.  You would think weed's going to be a great business.  Yeah, but who's going to be the winners and losers here?  Right.  Right.  It's like the mom-and-pop video stores, and then it all of a sudden turns into blockbuster. 
[01:35:00]  It's going to be like a blockbuster of weed.  What kind of companies do you think would be able to get involved with weed, though?  I wouldn't be surprised if pharmaceuticals somehow got involved with it and just did it  as their natural...  How do you not?  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  That's true.  Maybe some Fortune 500 companies?  Yeah.  Yes, Fortune 500.  Have it in their portfolio?  I've never been into a dispensary, and I don't trust myself to go in.  Oh, man.  Because I just know that I would like that smell.  Oh, probably.  Oh, I'll have a little pot, boy. 
[01:35:30]  It's legal.  I mean, why not, right?  Oh, boy.  No.  Can't do it.  No.  Don't do that.  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  No.  No.  I might have had a little taste recently.  Yeah?  A little taste.  A little Pearl Jam show.  Oh, yeah.  A little taste with the Quan.  Oh, wow.  A little taste.  It was nice.  Good?  I'm not going to lie to you.  It was nice.  A little taste.  Catch a little buzz. 
[01:36:00]  I've got to say, fuck you, Joe Rogan.  Catch a little buzz.  Joe Rogan got me back on the fucking...  Oh, a little weed?  Back on the train.  Hey, Joe smokes a lot.  How did you avoid it when you were there?  I was going to leave the room, because Kevin Smith gets high before the podcast, too.  And I leave the room.  But Joe goes, no, I'll go outside.  Like, you went to the other room.  I probably smelled it through the fucking concrete.  The toughest shit Rogan smokes.  It's literally like the smell in winter of a chimney.  That's how clear it is. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  But I was willing to leave the room, but he actually went into the lobby of his...  He has his own little setup.  It is hard to say no when Joe Rogan is...  He looks like he'd be fun to get high with.  Yeah.  It was...  I...  Like I said it already on the show, I took a baby hit before I did the podcast for Rogan.  Just a baby hit, but it was nice.  You felt it, right?  Oh, fuck yeah.  It was nice.  He was blowing smoke my way and everything, and I'm like, oh, I can't, man.  I haven't done this in...  Oh, you're too...  A little in your...  Dude, it was like, I'm not...  No joke, like 20 years without. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Then we went to Pearl Jam, and there might have been one of those electric cigarettes  that all the kids are using.  Did you try one of those?  With potting it?  Mm-hmm.  How was that?  Nice.  It was nice.  A little vape?  A little vape?  It was nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  If I ever come in in the morning and go, dude, I know I shouldn't have, but I still...  Oh, you're in trouble.  Fire me immediately.  Oh, Jimmy.  Because the train wreck is coming.  No. 
[01:37:30]  No, I think it's a perfect drug for me, to be honest with you.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It should never stop.  That would have been so less...  Oh.  If you don't have a problem with it, it's like, I believe you.  I mean, I don't have the desire to do it on any regular basis, that's for sure, but Joe  Rogan, I did the podcast a year ago, and then it was, what, I think October was the last  time, so...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe every once in a while, we'll see.  Why not? 
[01:38:00]  Why not?  Did you smoke the pot?  No, I haven't smoked weed in a long fucking time.  Why not?  I think you'd enjoy it.  I don't know.  No, I just...  Were all those parties going on, not even a hit every once in a while?  No.  No.  I don't know.  We'd never...  Me and the weed, you know, kind of okay, but there's always that thing in the back  of my head that's just kind of like, nah, you don't want to fucking get all paranoid.  Weed kind of always made me a little like, ah.  When do you think you don't want to be paranoid when you're on one of those websites or walking 
[01:38:30]  around with a gun strapped to you in your own home?  What do you consider paranoid?  Yeah, we would assume you're on the weed all the time.  Exactly.  What are you talking about?  You can't be more paranoid than you are.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  No, not even paranoid about real-life things.  Just you start thinking very deeply about space and the infinite and never-ending fucking...  I just enjoyed Pearl Jam a little more. 
[01:39:00]  That's all I remember.  Did it make your mouth dry?  Did it cut into that stuff?  Yeah, all that stuff is a little weird.  Pearl Jam.  It was perfect for the Pearl Jam show.  Do you have good shit?  Good shit.  What?  You know.  Yeah.  Like in the office when he goes, when they offer him some pot before his awful speech,  and he goes, no, no, no, man.  He goes, I go right to Munchie City.  Skunk?  Skunk?  Skunk?  Skunk?  Yeah, because he knows about the bees.  Oh, that was so embarrassing. 
[01:39:30]  Skunk?  Yeah, yeah.  I go right to Munchie City.  Right to Munchie City, huh?  I pretty much hate drinking nowadays.  I'm not into it at all.  And I was into wine for a while, and then I went back to beer.  I like Blue Moon.  That is about it.  Yeah?  And maybe a Corona every once in a while.  Blue Moon's a beer?  Yeah, it's a great beer.  It needed the money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Blue Moon's pretty good.  But you start doing the math with kids, and you're like, fuck, they're going to be up at 
[01:40:00]  like...  They're going to be up at six.  Oh, my God.  So, you know, you can't.  You just can't.  Won't they be quiet if you have a hangover, though?  Kenny said it right, man.  That's when Kenny stopped drinking.  He goes, because kids don't understand hangovers.  That's when he said he stopped his heavy partying.  But I don't miss it, man.  I don't like it anymore.  I just don't like the hangover.  I love sitting around fucking hanging out, bunch of guys downing some beers. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'll have a couple, but I don't know.  Yeah, but then you do feel like shit.  But I sit there like, for what, in the end?  I feel like shit the next day.  If I could sleep the next day, it's great.  Most of my 20s, I've wasted weekends just sleeping all fucking day, just dealing with  horrendous hangovers.  I always sucked when it came to hangovers.  I was the worst.  I had friends that I drank heavily with, who are, I'm sure, listening right now.  And these guys would pop right up in the morning. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, I can never understand that.  Pop right the fuck up.  No.  And even go back to maybe having a couple beers.  You know, you're young.  And I'd be suffering all day upstairs like a fucking pussy boy.  I couldn't suck it up.  I had horrible headaches.  You had the fucking ice rags on my eyes and my head.  The washcloth on my head.  Just watching the sun come up and go down while I'm still in bed.  What did I do?  The washcloth.  It just feels better.  I don't know.  It just felt good.  Yeah, you keep turning it over.  Put it on your eyes because the headache is just so... 
[01:41:30]  That horrible hangover sleep where you just keep waking up over and over again all day  long and then you finally get your shit together and then we went and did it all over again.  And after you're down a couple of beers, you're like, did I really even feel that bad?  Right.  I don't even think I really felt that bad.  I wasted my 20s and a few years in the 30s that way.  I mean, literally not seeing the weekends during the day.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it would start on Thursday. 
[01:42:00]  And then, you know, when I was the Opster.  Oh.  I was telling this story recently.  When I was the Opster.  No, there's three.  There's Greg.  There's Opie.  The Opster.  Oh, yeah.  When I was the Opster, when I thought I was fucking cool as shit.  Yeah.  I'd walk around WCMF when, you know, first started radio, bragging how many days in a row I  was drinking.  Nice.  I would walk around the radio station trying to get attention for it.  That's cool, though.  Isn't that embarrassing?  No, wow.  Jimmy, fuck, yeah.  Thumbs up. 
[01:42:30]  And everyone, like, would play into it, like, wow, you're up to it.  I forgot.  Hey, Op, you're on a bender, huh?  Like, man, it's been 21 straight days.  Oh, man.  And I can only imagine now when I walked away from these cubicles what these guys would say.  Isn't that cool?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I thought I was the coolest.  That guy's fucking cool, man.  No, I know it.  Hang with him.  I have life experience now, so I have no doubt what they were saying after I left.  Oh, no.  But at the time, being young and fucking thinking I was cool, I would drag it, come in, and then 
[01:43:00]  it became a thing.  Well, no, man.  Now I'm up to 22 days.  Did your friends call you the cruiser?  How douchey is that?  That story you told me.  That's douchey, right?  It's real douchey.  That's douchey, right?  Bragging about it.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  Oh, no.  It's not douchey if you're like, ah, I had a few straight days, but when you keep an  account, like, oh, I've got to keep the streak going. 
[01:43:30]  And then it became that, because then I'm like, I think I'm even cooler by keeping this  going.  I'm even cooler.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  And the streak ends when you're fucking, you know, you're being put in handcuffs, and  there's a fucking, an old person's walker on the fucking hood of your car.  Shit.  Speaking of which, what I found from those days, a little earlier when I was in college,  my son opened up a trunk that's in my foyer that's been sitting under a mirror for years. 
[01:44:00]  What are you, a magician?  My old fucking, it's a trunk that I guess my dad had.  It's one of those fucking trunks they would come off the boat with with their shit.  Old school.  I got one of those old school.  And he, he opens it up and there's a whole bundle of, uh, letters from, from my college  girlfriend.  Oh, shit.  I talked about this on the show before.  Did you read them?  And my wife's asking, I, and, and I swear, I go, I grabbed these from my parents' house. 
[01:44:30]  I was going to throw them away, but I'm like, I think this would be great for the radio.  Yeah.  And I forgot about them.  So I got to get the courage to bring them in and read them.  But I'm bummed I don't have what I wrote to her.  Right, right.  Because that would be opester shit.  Maybe, though, we can kind of figure.  I've tried to look her up.  We could try to figure out what you wrote based on what she wrote back to you.  Yeah.  I'll bring them in.  Yeah.  I got, I got to get a little braver though.  Oh.  Because I know it was awesome.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[01:45:00]  I think it was cringy.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  You know, all that shit.  It was like the first sign of fucking embarrassing.  You know, feeling for someone.  So blue moon is the worst piss water beer ever.  It's made by Coors.  There you go.  Ouch.  I like it.  Any beer you mention that you like, someone will say what a fucking shitty piss it is and  then recommend something that they like.  But fuck you.  Thank you, man.  Because, I mean, if I was going to be kind of like a hipster, I would have thought of some 
[01:45:30]  beer.  Yeah.  But I'm just telling the one I do like.  It's always some, they always have some obscure fucking micro brew that they want to fucking  turn you on to.  That's right, I do, man.  How about Six Points over in Brooklyn?  They make some of the best fucking beer in the world and you got the overblown fucking  oldest prat boy in the world, OB drinking fucking corn fucking products.  I'm thinking it's good.  Holy shit.  He cares.  They're in the fucking neck of it. 
[01:46:00]  The oldest prat boy.  He was drinking.  Look, I've been back to homecoming, well, not in a few years now, but trust me, there  are older frat guys.  Oh, no.  And I've never wanted to be that guy, so I think I finally tapped out as far as homecomings  go.  You know what I like?  Bud Light.  I don't like, I hate Coors, actually.  No, you're drinking it, dude.  You're fucking supposed to.  I understand what you're saying, but I've never liked Coors at all.  But I do like Blue Moon.  Oh, OB, please. 
[01:46:30]  What am I supposed to drink?  Please tell me.  Tell us.  I'm going to tell you straight up.  The best fucking brewery in New York, I think, is Six Points over in Brooklyn.  They make a beer called Resin that might be the best fucking beer in the country.  Really?  All right, hold on.  I'm going to keep an open mind.  What is this resin about?  I like to open his mind.  It's a double IPA.  It's about 9% alcohol.  Double IPA.  Yeah, because 9% alcohol, you want that.  Why do you want it to taste like fucking alcohol? 
[01:47:00]  No, it's...  Dude, I...  It tastes like grapefruit juice in a can.  It's delicious.  I don't like...  Grapefruit juice sucks.  Bitter shit.  Want to be orange juice without the sweet yumminess.  Shut up.  It's great.  It's orange juice for the kunky wife.  And why do you need 9% alcohol in your beer?  Okay, well, that's just one...  Because beer, you know, it is cool that you can drink a bunch of them without, like, getting  totally fucking...  If I want to do that, I'll drink, like, a Chimay or something.  Well, I'd stop drinking the Chimay...  Who likes to drink a ton of beers? 
[01:47:30]  I mean, you get all bloated and fucking...  Nobody likes to drink a ton of beers.  No, a lot of people like to drink a ton of beers.  That's why you drink something like Bud Light, you dumb fuck.  And we don't need to fit in skinny jeans.  No, you can't, you're working, man.  Because you could just sit there and drink them all day by the pool.  Right.  I'm not sitting there fucking looking at the bouquet coming...  If I want to be classy, I'll fucking drink some wine.  Shut up, you dumb beer snob.  I used to drink the Chimay's, but the hangovers were horrendous because one of those fucking 
[01:48:00]  things was, like, how many beers do you think?  Three?  Yeah.  One Chimay is about three beers, probably, so you can't have a lot of them.  And the Chimay's are very tasty, but they fuck you up too quick.  Dude, can I ask you one question?  Sure.  What's wrong with the beer we got?  We got that clip.  It drank pretty good.  It drank pretty good.  You didn't explain what...  We got six-point resin.  We understand your six-point...  What's the resin taste like again?  Grapefruit juice. 
[01:48:30]  Grapefruit juice.  That's delicious.  Oh, Edgar likes it.  Must be good.  It's good for your teeth.  Hey, you know what's a good...  Peele's is a good drinking beer.  A good drinking beer.  Don't joke.  There's a place in Manhattan I used to go to.  It's like an old trailer that's a bar.  Someone maybe helped me out with the name of it.  And they only had the cheap-ass beers.  Yeah.  And it brought you right back to being in the fucking woods with your friends or whatever. 
[01:49:00]  You had some Schlitz.  Yeah, all that shit they had.  Yeah, or Schmitz, too.  Pabst.  I forget all of them now, but remember those cheap beers.  And when you have one of them, it brings you right back.  And you realize it wasn't that bad.  Oh, you used to love that.  The Schafer's...  Meister...  But anything Meister Bar still?  Oh, sure.  I tell you one thing.  I enjoyed a Schaefer.  There would be no flavor at all.  I don't get it with you guys.  Oh, shit.  No flavor.  I was broke when I was young.  I was broke.  I had no money.  Exactly.  Yeah, we used to fancy man.  We had to drink what we could get.  And it was the cheap shit. 
[01:49:30]  I know what you're talking about enjoying the cheap shit at this age.  It brought me back is what I'm saying.  Schaefer was good.  That tasted good.  You give me a Schaefer at my lunch.  I have a nice beer.  I go back to the job site.  You drink your fancy.  You kids today.  My beer is Rheingold, the dry beer.  Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer.  I think this place is still around, but it's an actual trailer in the middle of Manhattan.  And it's a bar.  It's cool.  What do you think of Guinness?  I like Guinness. 
[01:50:00]  I like Stout.  I see Guinness is way too fucking over the top for me.  I love a good Guinness.  It's too bitter and heavy and all that.  I'm a light beer faggot.  I just like the fact that you drink it.  Blue Moon, but besides that, I always go light beer.  I'll go downstairs, pour out a pitcher of Bud Light, put it in the fridge in the summertime,  sit by the pool, and just drink fucking...  It's kind of nice.  It's nice and cold.  It's not heavy.  It's not this big...  I'm not having to assess every fucking mouthful. 
[01:50:30]  That sounds like an alcoholic right there, guys.  Or whatever.  Yeah, wow.  Guy with ears.  But I never went...  This guy's a bore at a party, just criticizing everyone's beer.  The girls are like, shut up and get me anything.  Oh, you...  I think you're just drinking that to get a buzz, man.  You're not drinking it.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Drinking just to get a buzz.  Wow.  Me and the earth.  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think Anthony is drinking just to get out of bed.  I think you're... 
[01:51:00]  At this point, yeah.  He's lifting it to it with a tire on his neck like Mickey Rourke.  Yes, Mickey Rourke.  To my friends.  To my friends.  To my friends, ladies' eyes.  Well, we do have some common ground, because I never went for the basic beers.  I was never a Budweiser guy, all that shit.  Never.  I need a little something going on in my beers, but I don't need the IPAs with the 9% double  IP fuckwad beer that tastes like fucking grapefruit.  Although... 
[01:51:30]  Delicious.  Although E-Rock brought over a beer that tasted like Fruity Pebbles.  He said it tasted like Fruity Pebbles.  God damn it, it tasted like Fruity Pebbles, and it was pretty good.  E-Rock.  It's amazing what the brewers are doing out there with flavors for beers these days.  Oh, it's amazing.  Yeah.  It really is, Ant.  It gives a shit.  You don't make steering wheel flavor, because that's eventually what you're going to want  them tasting.  Airbag powder lighter.  Exactly.  Prison pillar flavors.  In Walmart. 
[01:52:00]  What?  And Ant is like the same guy that would shop at a Target or a Walmart instead of going  to...  If there's something in a Target or a Walmart that I would need that would work, I would  fucking just buy...  Yeah, why...  What's the matter?  You're a wannabe kind of rich guy, but you're a snob.  You're a snob.  He's a hipster.  You're a hipster snob.  What are you wearing today?  What are you wearing?  Like a scuba diver?  I'm wearing...  Yeah, yeah.  What do you have?  What do you got? 
[01:52:30]  What do you have?  What's your outfit today?  Do you got a cowboy hat?  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking...  A monocle, a top hat, and a World Wrestling Federation belt.  And I'm only growing the facial hair on my cheekbones.  Just the cheekbones.  Just the cheekbones.  Two puffs.  Two puffs on my cheekbones.  Because that's what hipsters do.  And none of my hipsters do.  And none of my hipsters do.  Friends even mention it.  Right.  I've been wearing the same pajama bottoms for two days and doing fine hits righteously.  That's good.  I bet it's the greatest weed, too.  Oh, are you kidding me?  Oh, man. 
[01:53:00]  He only buys a speck of it.  You can't even see it.  It's one little speck.  All right, hold on.  We got Doggy Daddy who wants in on this conversation.  Hi.  Doggy Daddy from Rome, New York.  I don't know what he's talking about.  That beer's made in Utica, New York.  Not down there in...  Ah, not made in Brooklyn, is it?  It's made in Utica.  Is it good beer?  Oh, hell no.  But you've got to get all serenade.  Hold on.  Is it good beer?  Okay, it's not good beer.  Is that what you're saying? 
[01:53:30]  Guy from Rome, New York?  Oh, it's just really, really weak.  Weak?  What do you mean?  It's 9% alcohol and it tastes fucking great.  Yeah.  You guys calling me a drunk.  I can go out there and drink a bottle just like this.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I don't think Doggy Daddy would appreciate  a good IPA.  No.  I think it's a stock option.  I think he's more into the crystal meth.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  What?  That guy says I'm going to get some serenade right now.  What?  Are you drinking right now, Lady Di?  Are you drinking right now?  What?  Oh, boy.  I'll have you know.  I'll be drinking in about 20 minutes.  Because I just got my mind.  This guy.  I think he's already had like fucking three Bud Lights already.  You're talking to a Lush.  Bud Light?  This guy does bong hits all day and he's calling Doggy Daddy Lush.  Bong hits.  He drinks 9% alcohol beer and then he points to fucking...  But see, he doesn't think he's a Lush because he thinks his beer is cool.  Of course.  That's why.  You know what a hipster dick fuck you are? 
[01:54:30]  Oh, Christ.  What are you wearing right now, hipster?  It's best if you drink it with a funnel up your ass.  You get the true flavors.  You're an asshole.  I'm wearing a vest and a hockey helmet.  Why?  With ski goggles.  You have a problem with this?  Yes.  Yes.  In June.  Right.  I'm a hipster.  That's what I do.  Not a hipster.  Not a hipster.  Yeah.  You have to look at your boy Sal to see a hipster, not me. 
[01:55:00]  And I'm only growing my neck hair.  Just neck beard.  Just neck hair.  I have a neck beard and an ancient Roman bracer on my left wrist.  Fucking wannabe.  All right.  Thank you.  Good talking to you, boy.  All right, buddy.  Enjoy your IPA.  It's awesome.  Double IPA with the 9% alcohol.  9% fucking alcohol.  That, every fucking time I take a picture during the summer, it's just like, ah, relaxing 
[01:55:30]  by the pool.  And someone catches the Bud Light or something.  What the fuck is wrong with?  I'd rather not drink if it's only Bud Light or Bud Room.  I love the fact.  I do like a good craft beer.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's cold.  It's, you know, fizzy.  I don't give a shit.  But I don't know that world.  That's great.  Like, I'll go to FH Riley's, my brother's joint.  I haven't talked about it in a while.  Nice.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  And he has a very nice selection of beers.  Yeah.  But I don't know any of them.  Yeah, yeah.  So I go, which one is popular right now?  And he fucking pours me one. 
[01:56:00]  I'm like, oh, that's nice.  But then I forget that I ever drank it or what the name is.  I'm just not in that world, I guess.  Yeah, it's true.  But there is some good shit out there.  Six points from Brooklyn.  Nine per se.  He's fucking showing up at his friend's house with polio crutches and a fucking aviator scarf.  With a Raleigh Fingers mustache.  And a cowboy hat.  That's wrong with this guy.  And not one of his friends is brave enough to say, you look like a complete asshole. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, my God.  He's got elbow pads made out of conch shells.  Right.  What's he doing?  I hope the hipsters realize they're not hip anymore because it's become the norm.  The whole thing about being hip is to go against the grain completely.  And then when you see everyone else around you doing the exact same thing, now you're all not going against the grain anymore.  And you're all douches.  So then at that point, you turn around and go the other way.  Yep.  Fucking stupid hipsters. 
[01:57:00]  Shafer, one beer when you're having more than one.  More than one.  Shafer.  Here's the.  Yeah, that was good stuff.  My father drank Shafer.  That was in the old metal cans with that giant seam down the side and shit.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And it was.  They knew how to make a beer can.  And I'd be like, let me have a sip of beer.  And I'd be like, all right.  Right.  And it was always so fucking good, cold.  That's what I'm saying.  And like Shafer-y.  Very strong tasting for shit, Peter.  This place in Manhattan, they have this. 
[01:57:30]  You should go there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a dumb trailer.  You should.  And they have Shafer on tap.  Shafer.  Oh, those cans are great.  You're fucking leaving these impending wounds on child's feet, laying all over the backyard.  Those pop-off caps and tabs that you just throw on the ground.  What's the name?  Can we find the name of the place in Manhattan?  Because maybe they have a beer menu.  Now I'm curious to see what kind of beers they've got this joint.  What was the song for Shafer?  I think it's called Trailer Park or something even.  Shafer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Trailer Park Lounge?  There you go.  I think that's the place.  It's a Sandy Canaan.  Look at this.  Look at how old school that is.  You should go here.  I'm telling you.  Yes.  It's a little trailer like that?  Yeah.  And it's like.  What?  It's a hip place.  It's not like.  It's like one of those little Airstream trailers, though.  I haven't gone.  How do you fit in there?  Quite honestly, I haven't gone here in about 10 years.  Where is it?  I think it's in Midtown, I want to say. 
[01:58:30]  I've never seen it.  And what do they got on the menu?  Bottle beer, Corona Heineken, Bud Bud Light.  Oof.  Wow, they're really.  They might have changed their tune.  I think they just went.  I see what you did.  On tap, Rolling Rock Miller Lite, Sam Adams.  But in the cans is your cheap beers.  Your Pabst, Schaefer, and Rheingold.  Yeah, Rheingold.  You get a good can of Rheingold.  But it's a hip place.  It's not like, you know, it's a happening. 
[01:59:00]  You used to not be able to crush those metal cans.  Hell no.  You were trying to fucking crush.  Really tough cans.  Your dad liked a nice can of Schaefer?  Oh, the cans of Schaefer would fucking flow.  Would he ever drink a six pack in a row?  What?  What?  What?  You guys do beer can collections?  Him, his buddies would be out back by the picnic table.  Yeah.  And it was just our job.  We were constantly running in the house, grabbing beers out of the fridge and bringing them out.  Really? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  You were the delivery system.  Yep.  That was it.  Meh.  Sunset Wheat.  God damn it, Devin.  Sunset Wheat.  Let's give him some air time, please.  Go ahead, Devin.  Hey, Ulf.  How's it going, man?  Wee assholes.  What's up?  Hey, pretty sure that beer you rocked over would have been Sunset Wheat by Leinenkugels.  It's brewed out here in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.  There you go.  That's the one that kind of tastes like Fruity Pebbles.  Yeah, my cousin lives in Oyster Bay.  He has me ship the stuff out to him when he can't find it. 
[02:00:00]  I think he can find it because you rock just lives in Jersey.  I load him up in a big fucking tractor trailer and then I run block in a Trans Am.  Yeah, it's the best way to do it.  Keeps smoky off your ass, I swear.  It's great.  Good stuff, though.  Best in the summer.  Right on, brother.  Thank you.  Best in the summer.  It was good, man.  That one was all right when we had a nice little beach fire going.  There's Mr. Rock.  Where did you get your Sunset Wheat from?  You like a good craft beer, right?  Yeah.  Craft beer.  I actually run to like those better than regular beers. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  Don't change.  What you used to drink before you got into the craft beers.  Gravy.  And that would be right.  It never ends.  Yeah, you brought over the Fruity Pebbles beer.  That was nice.  Yes, it was very good.  You can't have too many of them.  No, no.  You've got to mix it up a little bit.  Well, that's just it.  All these craft beers, they're like, no, you can't have too many of them.  What if I'm drinking all day?  I need a beer I could have. 
[02:01:00]  You've got to find a what-if.  What-if.  What-if.  What-if scenario?  What are you, crazy?  You've got to have like a secondary beer, kind of.  That's why my two taps downstairs, one is Bud Light, the other is Guinness.  That's true.  On tap.  That's true.  Nitrogen, the whole deal.  And, you know, at night, sometimes a couple of Guinness is fine.  During the day, in the summer, fucking just keep those Bud Lights coming out back.  Never got into Guinness. 
[02:01:30]  Guinness is great.  Never got into it.  Especially on tap like that.  Nice, creamy fucking Guinness.  That shit's good.  How many calories is a Guinness?  Oh, don't even ask, Jimmy.  It goes right to my thighs.  I never realized beer was so fattening, but it is.  I mean, it's got to be at least 200 calories per Guinness, right?  Let's get the calories on a Guinness there, sir.  For us old men.  Huh?  Guinness will make your shit pretty heavy, too.  Oh, a Guinness shit is like, do you ever tar a roof? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  I swear, that streak on the bottom of the toilet lasts through 10 flushes.  Is there anything worse than when you drop a shit and flush quickly, and all of a sudden  it's cement hardens, and there's still a cluster, and you have a girl coming over, so you've  got to roll up toilet paper on your fucking hand.  I like it.  And scrub your eyes.  Did you ever, sorry, becomes, did you ever last week ever scrub shit off your own toilet  just as a fucking draw coming over? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Guinness has less calories than most beer.  Amazing.  125 calories.  Yep.  Per glass.  Isn't that amazing?  I think that average beer is 100,000, right?  Eight million calories.  Oh, I would have thought less.  Astounding.  Like Budweiser has 145 calories.  That's it, okay.  One four fives.  You know, talking about drinking.  Yes.  Yesterday, we brought up doing another super show.  I feel like 2014 could bring another Tequila and Donut Day.  Now, that was a fun show right there.  That's going to be tough to fucking do again, though.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:03:00]  That was impromptu.  That was.  You can't just plan that.  We've always had problems over the years when we try to force something that worked.  It worked once, and then we try to do it again.  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  There's no luster to it.  No.  We've done that a lot.  Remember the song fucking, what's his name?  The Indian homeless guy?  Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf.  Yeah, remember that?  Yeah.  Try to redo the song, and it just was shit.  That choking bum just couldn't come up with one more fucking verse.  He had sheer brilliance the first time he did it, and then it was just garbage. 
[02:03:30]  Couldn't he come up with one more verse?  Like, he just couldn't do it?  We tried for years.  For years we were on that project.  Just dip it to a tummy.  Because everyone said, holy fuck, this guy's singing from the heart.  You've got to move on to the next homeless guy.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  He loves you.  I'm a creep.  He follows you and everything.  He loves you.  Hey, look.  I think he's a great guy and a great success story.  You like this song?  He might be.  I might not have liked that version, let's just say. 
[02:04:00]  He's going to be.  What the hell am I doing?  Yeah.  He's going to be on the voice.  What?  He's going to be on the voice because of us.  Is he?  Yeah.  I think he told me to shut up, though.  Whoops.  I still talk to the mustard.  Yeah.  Supposedly he's going to be on the voice.  And that's all because of us.  Good for him.  And him coming in that day.  It's an amazing story.  Very happy for him.  Don't mistake.  No, I don't want anyone mistaking the fact that I don't really appreciate that version of that song by him. 
[02:04:30]  It's too bad.  In any way, do not confuse that with the fact that I wish him only the best.  Wow.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Missy in New York City.  Missy.  Missy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi.  Missy.  I actually live right next door to the trailer park place.  You know, where is it located?  It's on 23rd and 8th.  Now we know where you live.  All right.  Look for Missy.  Yeah.  Coming home with some groceries.  I'll just be walking up to women. 
[02:05:00]  Are you Missy?  With a trench coat on, my dick hanging out.  You would love me, honey.  Are you Missy?  Oh, she said you would love me, honey.  Oh, yeah?  Why is that, Missy?  Oh, I'm a big Bengal fan.  I'm actually getting a little Bengal for myself.  I love beer and I really do good gaming.  Oh, look at that.  Gaming.  Bengal.  Kitty.  Three things Ann doesn't care about when she's trying to fuck a girl.  Jesus.  Let's take a look at your Facebook. 
[02:05:30]  Can we take a look at your Facebook page?  Sure.  Go for it.  You want it off the air or on the air?  That's up to you.  I'll do off the air if you want.  Or you can go to my Instagram at MissyNYC.  Well, why don't we just...  Oh, you're MissyNYC.  I think I'll follow you.  You don't follow me, but you like a lot of my stuff.  Oh, shit.  Not good enough to follow.  Yeah, I've heard MissyNYC on Instagram.  I do like a lot of your stuff.  Thanks.  I know.  I love the freaks.  You're my favorite when it comes to the freaks. 
[02:06:00]  When are you getting a little Bengal?  I'm not getting him until March or so, because he's only like six days old.  Oh, she's cute.  Where do you live?  She lives downtown, next to the fucking trailer place.  She lives in Dimpleville.  Yeah, Kirk Douglas.  Oh, my God.  You have a cute dimple.  You know what you do?  You grab Bengal kittens by the face, and then you shake your hand around.  And do that as they're growing up. 
[02:06:30]  And they really like it and never bite you or scratch you back.  Do that with a pit bull, too.  But you don't grab it with your hand.  You grab his face with your clitoris.  Yeah.  Missy, what can you tell us about the trailer park lounge?  It's really not that great.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, I went there because I have cheap friends, and they wanted to go there.  And so we get there, and it's just full of really fucking weird people.  And, like, old, they remind me of old bus drivers. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, that's a, I had the complete opposite experience.  Actually, a lot of people, some of them look like Lady Di, no joke.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then there's, like, just, it's just a weird range of ages.  But they do have this really dope bowl of, like, all this alcohol, and you can share it with, like, four straws.  Ew.  Oh, that sucks.  Oh, with people you know.  Oh, don't share it with, like...  Oh, I thought it was you sharing it with the bus driver-looking people and Lady Di-looking people.  Would you share a... 
[02:07:30]  I would never share out of a straw people's backwash.  Oh, fuck yeah.  No!  In Harvard, you would share the scorpion bowls at that Chinese restaurant, which I think is also a comedy club.  Oh, yeah?  They were famous for their scorpion bowls, but when you ordered them, you had to point out your friends.  Because I forgot, this is many years ago, but I think you had to have at least four people.  And it would be a huge fucking alcoholic mess.  Fish tank kind of a thing?  It was big, man.  It was like...  I don't remember exactly how it came now. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  It's been many years.  And then you would just sit there with straws.  Yeah.  And just sip away.  Sucking it down.  She hung up.  Missy hung up.  Oh.  Lives by the beer trailer.  Yeah, that's a big thing at Harvard, the scorpion bowls.  Huh, but...  I believe to this day they still do them.  Aren't they amazing?  But I always goof on fucking Harvard.  I feel like we went to this place when we were in Boston.  I think I showed you the joint back in the day.  It was upstairs. 
[02:08:30]  It was a Chinese place, but it had a pretty happening bar scene.  Nah.  I don't remember much.  About Boston?  No.  Not with that fucking wife.  Get all that out of my system.  I feel like I dragged you there once.  Maybe.  Get me out of the house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Um...  I don't know.  We don't need to tease anything.  You guys will probably still listen, hopefully. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, hang around.  Farts?  Yeah.  No.  We both chickened out on the Scarlet Johansson pictures.  Yeah.  I just didn't want the rejection.  I said hi, and then after that, I didn't know what to do.  Oh.  You should have squeezed the big tits.  I didn't know what to do.  Honk.  So I just went to the bar.  Honk.  Uncomfortably.  Yeah.  I ran away from the situation.  Yeah.  Because what do you say to her?  And Ryan Reynolds, he almost remembered he was on our show that day.  Oh, I know. 
[02:09:30]  I like to do that.  Almost remember.  He almost remembered.  Yeah.  There was like a little glitter in his eye, like, oh, wait, how do I know all these guys?  And then we had to tell him, and he was like, oh, yeah, if so, yeah.  And then we're like, yeah, you know?  And he's like, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Anyway.  Well, all right, man.  I went up rocking.  Good talking to you.  I went up rocking out with Edward Norton that night.  Oh, that's right.  I was rocking out with Edward Norton on the balcony.  I forgot about that. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And he was a good enough guy.  Yeah.  Sure.  He likes Radiohead, huh?  Apparently he does.  Remember that frozen T-shirt thing we did yesterday?  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  Did you see a few yesterday?  Yeah.  By the way, a guy named Lazy Bob on the Twitter, I guess he's the new guy.  I understand what's going on in the underground world.  Oh.  He might be one of the new guys.  All right.  And he took our audio and he synced it up with the videos that we were watching yesterday, 
[02:10:30]  which is a fucking great thing that the fans are doing.  And, you know, I got to hijack a couple of these videos from my own channel.  Yeah.  And I certainly did.  He's going to take them, yeah.  I took the frozen T-shirt one that Lazy Bob edited and it's on my YouTube channel, OB Radio.  Check it out.  It's hilarious.  It's so much fucking funnier when you see us.  No, you don't see us, but you hear us and you see the video we're commenting on.  Yeah.  It's like Mystery Science Theater. 
[02:11:00]  It's like Beavis and Butthead-ish at times.  It's such a great little fucking concept.  I mean, really, that's where things are going.  And, you know, more and more of these type of videos are popping up in the Opie and Anthony world.  So the latest one, though, I threw it on my channel.  There's other ones.  I think there's a, I don't know.  I'll tweet where it is.  I got to be careful.  Anyway, so we did the frozen T-shirt thing yesterday, and then, you know, we love our listeners 
[02:11:30]  because then they bring to our attention all sorts of things during the day, and I love that about Twitter.  And they all were retweeting Sean Hannity and putting us in the mention to make us aware that Sean Hannity was doing the frozen T-shirt thing yesterday.  I saw it yesterday.  I saw it last night.  I'm like, oh, no, don't do it.  Don't do it.  No.  And then they did it.  A little late to the party.  Yeah, everybody else is in front of it already.  They went from a thing to do to now everyone's making fun of the fact that all these news channels did it. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  And then he's doing it and teasing it like, oh, my God, this is an amazing thing that I'm about to do.  It's, first of all, we discussed this yesterday.  It's not amazing.  You know what is kind of amazing to me and what's a lot better than a T-shirt freezing?  Right.  The billions and billions of gallons of water in the Great Lakes.  How about the fact that those froze?  Right.  How about the fact that there's ice on those?  Well, I showed the picture out of Chicago.  That would be impressive.  That's impressive right there.  Especially knowing, like, when we were growing up that we had T-shirts that looked just like that in our rooms. 
[02:12:30]  Right?  Yeah, exactly.  Bang it on the fucking bedpost.  Clunk.  That thing wasn't moving after a while.  Didn't even have to be in the cold.  No, we were talking about cum-soaked T-shirts for the people that don't understand what that was about.  Yeah, yeah.  I got a tweet saying, Search is coming in across the hall this morning.  At, um...  That would be sick.  He's doing the Sway? 
[02:13:00]  Is he doing Sway?  I got it from a young lady.  Nice.  Who sent it to all three of us.  All right.  Well, maybe we'll get the search in.  Is it legit?  I think she is, yeah.  What time?  I don't know if it's here or not.  Across the hall.  It was across the hall, no?  We only have one across the hall neighbor.  Yeah.  I'm assuming.  Sway, who's right over there.  And Sway would be the show you would go to.  It's a hip-hop show.  It has to be Sway.  It has to be.  No, it's a girl.  Oh, okay.  It's a girl.  He's saying he's coming in today, this morning, across the hall. 
[02:13:30]  Okay, so that would be...  Unless she's working somewhere else and saying across the hall from her.  I don't know.  Oh.  Maybe Kenny can check the...  What a vague...  What a vague tweet.  Fucking tweet that is.  Across the hall from her would mean nothing to us.  Right.  But across the hall, across the hall would be Sway, which means...  I think she's talking about Sway, but I don't know.  We could open that door and go, yo, search!  Yo, search!  Yo, search!  Keeping it real right in here!  He'd come in going, yeah, I'm keeping it real.  Yeah, yo.  Keeping it real.  From the streets. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  I could absolutely say, hey, I haven't missed an episode yet.  Good point.  I saw you on Arsenio.  I saw you on PIX 5 o'clock news.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  If we can get him in here, you should try to do like an Arsenio interview with him.  Be like, I've found that...  Now, back in the day, you...  You...  Swayio.  He had one and a half hits, period.  I'd say one and two halves.  Really? 
[02:14:30]  He had two half hits.  Two half hits?  Yes.  Okay.  Which doesn't equal one whole hit, by the way.  He's a one-hit wonder.  Chap lips are so fucking dangerous.  Why?  You could grab onto a piece of loose skin with your fucking tooth or your fingernails  and go like, all right, there's this Russian roulette.  Is it going to just come off and you'll be like, ah, now I don't have that poking at me.  Or is it going to tear that thin red stripe all the way to your tongue?  Do you ever like pull out a lot faster thing and it would do less damage? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Like it's going to be horribly wrong.  Like a tablecloth under teacups.  Right, right.  It doesn't quite work.  You go for the quick, like, all right, I know I can take care of this and you just go.  Yeah, yeah.  And then all of a sudden it just gets snagged and caught.  It just goes all the way up.  You've got to pull in the same direction it's pointing.  Oh, I am.  If you pull back.  What, do you think I'm a fucking rookie?  Well, just letting the audience know so they don't endanger themselves.  You unravel like a fucking mummy. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, that's.  You know, I might have a picking issue every once in a while.  I know the ins and outs of picking.  This chap looks suck.  Yeah.  And then yesterday at the dentist with the chap lips, that was fun.  I thought you said it.  When you've got to really, ah, you've got to open your mouth wide and it's just cracking open.  I'm going to lick them?  Yeah, do that.  Lick them with your cocks.  I hear you're a day closer to the fake teeth.  Fake?  They're not fake teeth.  Big, fat, fake teeth.  For those of you keeping your scorecard, I had the permanent bridge put in over here. 
[02:16:00]  It spans over, you know, an empty spot.  It's in there.  What are they put in the empty spot, though?  I understand the bridge concept.  That's why it's a bridge.  The two teeth on either side are capped.  Right.  And then in the middle is nothingness.  No, but there's nothing.  But it's a tooth.  It's like a porcelain tooth connected on the bridge.  Right.  That spans between the two other caps.  And then they fucking cement that shit in there. 
[02:16:30]  That's great.  Ha, ha, you asshole.  Oh, you're going to look like that?  Seth puts on some fake denture teeth.  You're going to look all right, man, with this.  No!  Some fucking case of free dent.  Now, uh, now in...  Are you going to put your teeth in, like, you know, something during breaks?  Should I do that during breaks?  Yeah.  And then pop them in quick for a read?  What do you have to put them in?  I forget.  Polydent or something?  What was it?  In a little glass at your bedside table?  No.  What was it called?  Effortent.  Every tooth in my head is permanent.  It is not, uh, they don't come out. 
[02:17:00]  It isn't a denture.  Like your hair.  And what, exactly.  It's real growing teeth.  It's, uh, it's now the fronts.  As I've said many times in the past.  This is where we can't look at you.  Because I know it's going to go horribly wrong.  They were discolored.  And you're going to go, you're going to be like, oh, you know, it's not that bad.  They were discolored.  Yeah.  When I was, uh, in my early teens, uh, I had to take tetrable.  I had to take tetracycline for my, um, for my mild acne. 
[02:17:30]  Which people said, uh, looked like, uh, one guy really made me feel bad.  He said, someone set my face on fire and put it out with cleats.  I felt very, I was, I think I cried at that.  I think I had to cry.  But why did dad say that, mom?  Oh my God.  So back in the day.  Oh, it was so bad.  That's why you can handle the haters.  Uh, you know what?  Oh, it was the war.  We had real haters. 
[02:18:00]  Exactly.  Like to your fucking face.  Right to it.  They were mean.  Not some asshole in their basement hiding from you.  Oh, were they mean.  Two inches from the face.  Oh, just meanies.  Did that bother you when he said that?  Oh, it bothered me so bad.  Did he say just you two or the people around?  Uh, there were people around.  And, you know, I'm going around thinking maybe, well, maybe it's looking better today.  It's, I know.  No.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  So they didn't have, um, they didn't have, uh, uh, Accutane back then.  Um, so they, you know, like just load you up with fucking antibiotics and shit. 
[02:18:30]  Does Accutane work?  Yes.  It's the best.  If you could get, uh, if you could get that taken care of before any scarring happens,  you'll be golden.  It's fucking amazing.  Although I think it, it like, you know, fucking might make you sterile or give you three headed  kids or, um, teens have been known to kill themselves while they're taking it.  But I think that's just depression from their acne.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Uh, but anyway, it works.  I finally took it at the, uh, young tender age of 35 years old when it was finally available 
[02:19:00]  to me.  Thanks.  Fucking.  That's great.  It's like fucking paving one square mile of the moon.  It doesn't quite work.  Damage has been done.  Oh my God.  It sucks.  What are you going to do?  Uh, that's it.  Oh, real.  Yeah.  Let me go to Tommy.  Cause he's going to explain it a little further for you.  Go ahead, Tommy.  Hey, good morning guys.  Anthony, uh, is tetracycline to your teeth?  What? 
[02:19:30]  Uh, a thyroid woman to a fat chick?  No, it really works.  I mean, it's, it's not just an excuse, but it does.  It discolors your teeth.  Does it clean up your chlamydia?  Because someone is saying you, they also take it for chlamydia.  Is that true?  Well, you know what?  Girl, Anthony fucked.  You're on the line.  If Buzz gave me chlamydia back then, then I never knew it.  Let's go to James in LA.  James, what's this chlamydia connection?  Yeah, I, uh, I was unfortunately, when I was in Los Angeles, I fucked around and caught chlamydia 
[02:20:00]  one time and tetracycline is actually, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, antibiotic for that.  Well, it still is.  It's an antibiotic.  Yeah.  Back to the story.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't know that.  But it, uh, yeah, it discolors your, your teeth.  So I, uh, I got all nice teeth now in the, in the back stuff and I want everything taken care of.  So I'm getting, uh, uh, uh, uh, veneers, laminates. 
[02:20:30]  They, they go over, over your existing teeth.  They don't, they're not caps.  They're not dentures.  They're not fucking anything that replaces your teeth and stuff.  They are veneers that go over the front.  They're the same shape and everything.  It will just make it so it's not discolored anymore.  But it's like when you wear layers in the winter, you looked a little bigger.  So your teeth are going to look a little bigger with that extra layer on it. 
[02:21:00]  No, because they do take, they're so thin.  How thin are they?  They're very thin.  And then they do, like, they do just shave enough off the front that they, it fits right on there.  They're going to shave the front of your teeth.  Not as much.  They don't go to the nerve.  It's not like fucking marathon, man.  But that's got fucking hurt.  I don't care.  Anthony laughs.  We're going to look under and see the double tooth.  No.  Oh, no.  We're going to see a double tooth.  No, because it goes under.  Are we going to see that black shit in your gums? 
[02:21:30]  No, no, no.  I swear.  Oh, it goes under like a little hook?  Yes.  It's like a little ledge.  So they, they, they, they like eliminate a little of that.  They shave it on the front and then they pop it on there.  You just don't, when my dentist is fantastic.  That sounds like it's going to be painful, though.  No, it takes a while.  Is she saying it's going to be painful?  No.  Here's the deal, though.  Right.  Um, it takes four hours to do half of the top and then four hours for the other half 
[02:22:00]  and then four hours for the bottom.  Wow.  Four, eight, twelve, sixteen hours for the whole thing?  It's a long time.  Sure.  So I have two appointments set up already.  Eight hour appointments?  Two weeks.  No, yeah.  Well, no, four hours.  Four, they only do four hours at a time.  But here's the deal.  I, and, and she assured me that you won't be able to tell, it'll be fine.  But there are temporaries that need to be on there until the laminants are made. 
[02:22:30]  So they're going to shave your teeth down and just hook you up with those Halloween buck  teeth?  No.  She assures me.  Please don't fucking take a day off during that.  Now, the, the, the only difference, because now when you get these, uh, uh, uh, veneers,  they're separate.  They're individual veneers.  They go, oh, one per tooth.  So there's spaces between everything looks beautiful.  But it's very, the temporaries, the temporaries. 
[02:23:00]  I knew there would be a catch.  One, one piece, but they do mold them where you see a space.  Oh, boy.  But it's not like crazy, you know, but, but she assures me that like a week until they  make up the veneers.  I hope the truck carrying your veneers flips over and catches on fire in a blizzard somewhere.  Six months.  I hope it does too.  Right on the comedy store when you're doing a set.  That's right. 
[02:23:30]  Turn it into the happy land.  Just me and five people will be killed.  Five people will be happy it happened.  Oh, that's just sad.  Oh, God.  That was just sad.  Oh, it really is sad.  So, so that's, um, so, uh, yeah, that's what's going to be happening in the coming weeks.  Uh, the last, I believe the, the, uh, middle of February here and, uh, middle of January, 
[02:24:00]  I mean, and, uh, the beginning of February, uh, this will all be going down.  Nice.  And, um, it'll brighten my smile a little bit.  It'll, uh, get rid of the discoloration.  Plus all the teeth will be so much bigger.  No, they won't.  It's going to be the exact same teeth, only like a horse.  No, no, I'm not doing the Voss.  Only, uh, they, they'll, they'll be, uh, a little white, not white, bright white. 
[02:24:30]  They're going to match the, like the, with the bridge work here.  It'd be wonderful.  All right.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  I just don't know.  Good luck to you.  Absolutely.  I'm sure it's going to work out just like that.  This, this dentist is a miracle worker.  Absolutely.  We're going to find fucking Anthony's head in Jack Waltz's bed.  Of course.  I'm sure they'll be fine.  Yeah.  They will. 
[02:25:00]  They won't be nearly, but your teeth, how are they going to hold them to your, how do  they hold those?  They have the most amazing adhesives these days.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  God.  The things they fucking have to, when they mold your teeth, they got to like mold, put  like a thing in there and you bite down and it's gag inducing.  Fucking chemically.  And then there's this other thing they do that.  I don't remember.  They used to do this.  There's this chemical they put on your gums now.  Oh no.  It's called gum.  It's called sodium by gum. 
[02:25:30]  It's a, it, what it does is it retracts your gums back.  It like recedes your gum.  So when you mold the new teeth, you could get it molded where it's under the gum line.  Oh my God.  That's why they say, but that's why when you say, does you see any black under there?  Like that doesn't happen anymore because they actually fit them further up than they got  to go.  Get that black shit onto your gum.  So we don't see it anymore.  But this shit tastes literally like vomit acid. 
[02:26:00]  It's like the acid that when you vomit and, and you have to leave it on for like 10 minutes.  So you're sitting there like this and, and, and, and just saliva is pouring out of your  mouth.  And I need like the little suction thing.  I hold it myself.  Do you video this?  You should video this.  I really should.  Yeah.  I should video the next phase.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is a horrible stuff, but like all that stuff just tastes so awful, but it's, 
[02:26:30]  it, it worked.  And then the, the cement really fastens in there.  I had the temporary bridging with the like temporary cement for two weeks without a, with  nary a problem.  Without a hitch.  Oh, so I just, well, I'm hoping for the best though.  But how, how do they have a glue that sticks to, I mean, I know the tooth is porous, but  how does a glue actually stick to a service that's always getting wet and chewing and having  fucking amazing crackers or whatever?  They got some good shit now.  They cut that.  They rough up the tooth.  They make sure it's the fucking dry before they do it. 
[02:27:00]  And then when they do it, it just fastens my mouth.  And they mix, they mix that shit and they have like seconds to use it properly.  Yep.  They sit there.  Okay.  Now, now go put the tooth on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm still having problems with my fucking tooth.  Oh man.  What's wrong with your tooth?  The root canal tooth is still fucking achy.  You probably still have some, some shit going on.  The bottom or upper?  They think it might be a crack.  So now I fucking have to go get a 3D x-ray.  What the hell's that about?  It still bothers me.  It's been fucking four months. 
[02:27:30]  Is it upper or lower?  It's the famous hummus tooth.  Ah, the famous hummus tooth.  You broke your tooth on hummus.  Yeah, I knew there might have been a problem.  Then I might get braces soon.  Oh my God.  Why don't we take, wait, you might get what?  You don't have braces.  No, you don't have to go anywhere.  What happened?  What?  What the, what are you talking about?  What did we just hear?  What did I hear?  You just mumble something.  We all have dental work maybe that we're, uh, might have done. 
[02:28:00]  You're at the perfect age for braces.  You're not really getting braces, are you?  Uh, I'm thinking about it.  Like quiz kid Donnie and Magnolia?  I got some, I got some, I got some, they're such wonderful.  Who's that?  Is that Sirk?  Yo, Sirk!  No, that's, uh, what's his name?  Who, um.  I think that's the guy that used to be on that show at Deadwood.  Oh, Timothy Oliphant?  Yeah, wasn't that Timothy Oliphant?  He was in another show recently, too.  He's in a new show, uh, Justified. 
[02:28:30]  We've had him on.  We've had him on?  Yeah.  Long time.  I don't remember.  Lovely man.  So anyway, we'll take a break.  Um, so, yeah, let's talk about this.  Old tinsel teeth.  I want to know about that.  This is definitely what I am intended on doing.  He definitely went to Jared.  So, what are you planning, maybe?  I think this has been hinting for many years that I might want to look into the Invisalign  for my bottoms in the front. 
[02:29:00]  How do they make them?  They put them on while they're crooked and just...  I've always had, I've had two crooked teeth in the bottom forever.  I don't, I don't know.  But I've been thinking about it.  He says it's not that bad.  Are they inside the teeth?  Although he does, he said it will affect your speech.  I'm like, do you understand what I sound like now?  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine?  But then he's like, maybe you could take them out during the radio show.  What if?  No, that would be...  It's all those molds that, you know, you put one in... 
[02:29:30]  One in, it's a little different, and then the next one's a little different.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who's that?  Who that, yo?  Looks like a...  I mean...  Who that, yo?  I really think you should do it.  Really?  Yeah, it'd be funny.  I mean, it'd be hilarious.  You don't think I'm too old for braces?  No, you mean you're gonna be alive for the fucking...  How ironic if you start sounding like that fucking woman that we've made fun of on MSNBC.  Melissa Harris Perry?  Yeah.  Can we get another clip of her?  She's terrific to listen to.  Oh, man. 
[02:30:00]  I think the Blaze had a really good clip about her, because she's into some crazy ideas.  What's Spade doing out there with his Jiffy Pop hat?  It's a little smaller than it used to be, his hat, right?  Yeah.  He used to have the...  On MTV, that thing was fucking giant.  Looked like that...  Those things on the Taj Mahal.  Right.  They look like a baseball bat bag.  Now it's just kind of...  It's not that bad.  No. 
[02:30:30]  Sweet.  So when are you thinking of going and doing this?  Maybe soon.  I gotta figure out this fucking root canal tooth still.  But maybe I'll do it.  Fuck it.  My teeth are the only part of me that haven't given me trouble.  Like, I've had a couple of fillings and things.  Like, my eyes suck.  My sleep sucks.  But my teeth have actually had very good luck with it.  As far as being straight and not having any issues.  Like, look.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aw.  Yeah.  A boyish grin.  Yeah, I've been told that many times.  Nice.  Straight smile, Jimmy.  Lucky Jimmy.  You want to hear this clip from Melissa?  We're going to go into this cold, but we just want to... 
[02:31:00]  What is she talking about?  We just want to...  That's an old clip.  I know, but we want to hear her...  All right.  Like Chippa.  Yeah, she's...  This fucking chick's great.  Morning, I'm Melissa Harris Perry.  I want to talk today about a controversial word.  It's a word that has been with us for years.  And like it or not, it's indelibly printed in the pages of American history.  A word that was originally intended as a derogatory term meant to shame and divide and demean. 
[02:31:30]  The word was conceived up by a group of wealthy white men who needed a way to put themselves  above and apart from a black man to render him inferior and to diminish his accomplishments.  President Obama has been labeled with this word by his opponents.  And at first he rose above it, hoping that if he could just make a cause for what he'd  achieved, his opponents would fail in making their labels sick.  But no matter how many successes that he had as president, he realized there were still 
[02:32:00]  many people for whom he'd never be anything more than that one disparaging word.  A belief he knew was held not just by his political opponents, but also by a significant  portion of the American electorate.  And so he decided if you can't beat him, you've got to join him.  And he embraced the word and made it his own, sending his opposition a message they weren't  expecting.  If that's what you want me to be, I'll be that.  Y'all know the word that I'm talking about.  What?  What?  Obamacare.  Oh!  That's right.  I said it and I'm not ashamed that neither is President Obama. 
[02:32:30]  I thought it was nigger.  So did I.  Jesus.  But do you see what she just did there?  The punchline.  Nigger the whole time.  Right.  Even though she doesn't say it.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Who saw that coming?  Enough of this shit.  She's talking about the president and she wants you to think nigger while she's talking  about the president.  I know.  Right.  Even though she knows she's going into another direction.  Yep.  She is saying that safely because she knows that Obamacare is the word. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  That's that fucking, oh my God.  That phony shit.  Yeah.  Some of that phony shit.  The word is Obamacare?  Really?  Yeah.  Obamacare, she's equating to nigger.  So that was, but she's saying that all the white people came up with Obamacare to make  themselves superior to people?  Yeah.  Really?  I think she went a little far.  And then you feel like an asshole at home because you're thinking the n-word the entire  time.  I'm like, oh shit.  Oh fuck.  I guess I am a racist because it wasn't the n-word this time.  Oh, the answer's naggers. 
[02:33:30]  Self-care.  Right.  Absolute genius that was.  Oh, that was great.  People don't annoy us or whatever.  A horrified fucking audience.  With all those animated eyes in the audience.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I haven't watched South Park in years.  Is it still good?  I don't know.  They changed Cartman's voice.  I'm pissed.  They did?  Yeah.  What was that about?  I think they gave up on processing it or something.  What?  It used to be way up here.  And now he just sounds like Stan. 
[02:34:00]  And Kyle.  He just sounds like they all sound the same now.  What are you talking about?  What's that about?  I don't know.  But I've noticed.  No.  I don't like it.  And that, like, Cartman's voice.  He'll go into it where he'll be like,  Excuse me again.  I'm getting ahead.  But, like, his voice really has changed to a more normal, unprocessed kind of.  This is an old one, no?  Is that an old one?  No, this is the new episode.  All right.  New episode.  Let me just notice.  He sounds more like fucking.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Stop, stop, stop.  This is not how you fight.  You think this is a joke?  On Black Friday, there's going to be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall,  keeping you from getting Xbox Ones.  So what do we do?  We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spot.  It sounds like the other characters.  He's got nothing to have diabetes.  Who does that voice, Matt or Trey? 
[02:35:00]  That's Matt, I think.  Do you think he looks like Matt?  Maybe Trey.  Trey.  So maybe Trey, like you, got some falsies, and he messed up his voice a little bit.  Wow, he shouldn't have gotten dentures, then.  He shouldn't have gotten dentures.  I think he's been doing the voice for so long, he's probably just changing.  He's changing.  Maybe.  Because that would be a dumb move to purposely change his voice, don't you think?  I think, but they always seem to have processed it up a little bit.  They pitched it up a little. 
[02:35:30]  Maybe they have some reason for why they do it, then.  Maybe.  I think it's more cost-effective.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I liked it better when it was kind of higher and kind of goofy.  I bet it's not a cost issue, though.  Those guys are fucking...  Nah, I don't think so, either.  Financial something.  I don't know.  We still got two things to do.  We got the frozen t-shirt thing with Sean Hannity, and we also have a really good Louis C.K. clip.  From Leno.  Yeah.  And maybe a couple other things we'll squeeze in there before the end of the show. 
[02:36:00]  The Opian Anthony Show is back.  Tighten your sphincter.  All right, let's finally get to Sean Hannity.  So, that frozen t-shirt thing has been all the rage.  All the rage.  During this polar vortex.  Oh, the polar vortex.  Are we still in the polar vortex?  I think we are.  Yeah.  Nice.  The news just loved saying that.  It was that perfect news phrase thing. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  Because it's kind of new.  It's scary sounding.  So, the news just runs with it.  People are like, oh, did you hear?  Polar vortex.  And then they fucked up in Buffalo.  They sent a lot of people to Buffalo because they were having a blizzard.  The first blizzard since 93, I want to say.  Yeah.  Which is incredible to me because when I was up in Buffalo, it seemed like there was a blizzard every other fucking week.  Just lake effects.  Just lake effects.  Not much lake effect snow because the lake has frozen over. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, that's right.  You need fucking water.  You get the lake effect snow before that thing freezes over.  Thus then, less snow totals after the lake freezes.  Meteorologist.  It's hilarious, though, because they spend all that money sending people assuming this is going to be the spot.  And then it's sort of a bust because they were saying at first, and maybe someone can give me an update, that Buffalo was going to get three feet of snow.  That's ridiculous.  I was up there for some of those.  It's unbelievable to see that much snow.  It's incredible. 
[02:37:30]  It's kind of fun, actually, to see.  Yeah.  But then they had the dumb blonde up there.  I think it was CNN.  And she's like, well, you know, we got eight inches.  Yeah, it happens.  You know, the totals are a little less.  And then they try to still spin how bad it still is.  But it's not bad at that point.  It's just a regular snowstorm for those people.  They could get more in the coming days.  But Buffalo has seen eight inches of snow a million times in their lifetime.  Yeah.  But they paid for everyone to go up there, so they feel like, ah, we've got to do something. 
[02:38:00]  Eight inches of snow and freeze some T-shirts.  Unless it's changed since then.  But that's what was going on in Buffalo last night when I was watching.  Yeah.  But with that said, the news stations, to show you how cold it's been, they decided to go with this frozen T-shirt thing because none of them have originality whatsoever.  So one station comes up with the great bit, quote.  I mean, if you saw it one time, you'd be like, oh, all right, that's kind of different and whatever.  But then you see station after station after station doing the exact same fucking thing.  And we beat the shit out of everyone yesterday. 
[02:38:30]  And then you guys tweeted all of us saying, uh-oh, Sean Hannity is doing the frozen T-shirt tonight, meaning last night.  He did indeed.  And I couldn't be bothered by it, to be honest with you.  We have it here for everybody.  Is that Timothy Elephant?  Is he that tall?  Is he a tall drink of water, as they say?  Media destination.  Media.  Why would he look at him and remember, even though he's done this show?  Oh.  Media destination.  It might not be him.  It looked like him.  I don't think that's him. 
[02:39:00]  That doesn't look like him.  It kind of looked like his face.  Let's find out who that guy was.  We are a media destination.  We have to be on this shit.  Wouldn't Roland know?  No.  Roland thought a guy wanding us was Jay-Z.  What?  At the MTV thing.  I told you I did that junket a long time ago.  I forgot about that.  Yes, I do remember now.  That's fucking funny.  That's not him.  It's some guy named Jeff Stoltz.  He's an actor.  Yeah.  Eric's brother? 
[02:39:30]  I have no idea.  What does he act in?  The Finder.  He was in Seventh Heaven.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  Pop up the pic.  Yeah, he's got a show.  He's got a show.  We have a show.  All right.  He didn't say yes to him.  He's not...  But we have a show.  He's not not doing you.  He would come in any time and do the show.  I'm not saying we want him.  Yeah, fuck him.  So he has a show.  He's this big thing.  We have a show.  No, I'm saying that's why he's here.  What?  Because he has a show coming.  Well, good for him. 
[02:40:00]  We're here, too, because we have a show.  Yeah, but you didn't take him.  Well, why would we?  We're doing our show.  Why would we do his show?  Is that his chick?  That's Stacy Keebler.  Oh, he does our...  Wait, the Keebs is with this guy?  The show.  I don't know if they're dating.  All right.  Wait, I missed it.  I missed it.  What?  It's the voice of our show.  Oh, all right.  That's terrible.  Okay. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, so let's do the show on Hannity.  All right.  Enough with the guy that also has a show.  Good for him.  I care less about.  Right.  It's called Enlisted.  Oh, that's the new show.  Our show's called O.P. and Anthony.  Who cares?  You're not competing.  All right.  Well, let's just move on with our show and not worry about his.  He does what he does and we do what we do.  It's fine.  You stop to look at him and talk about him.  I was cool with it until I found out he had a show also.  What did you think?  I've got such a bad cough still. 
[02:41:00]  Let's do this.  This is Sean Hannity last night.  Oh, Sean.  We love you, buddy.  But what?  You're better than this.  What are you doing?  You never want to be the last guy to do the bit everyone's doing.  Yeah.  The last guy.  That guy almost looked like Tom Cruise.  I think it was Tom Cruise.  Did you see that?  Oh, my God.  He almost looked like Tom Cruise.  Oh, wait.  No, it's some guy.  If you guys can't keep focus, I'm going to shut the cartons.  It's some guy.  It's not Tom Cruise.  We're immediate destinations, so we're on high alert.  You don't have to be on high alert. 
[02:41:30]  You approve and disapprove of guests in advance.  I'm a big fan of grabbing these guys as they walk by.  It's way better.  It is.  It's less informal.  Because then you go, oh, that's right.  He's famous.  Yeah, come on in.  Because we can just keep them as long as we want, get them out.  That's right.  Oh, so.  It doesn't have to be a thing.  All of a sudden it becomes a thing.  A thing.  When you book a guest, you have to do like 20, 25, 30 minutes.  Yeah.  When you just find somebody in the hall, you could do three minutes.  Three minutes and then get the fuck out of our studio.  Beautiful, right?  Beautiful. 
[02:42:00]  Okay.  That's what I'm talking about.  Keeping it rare.  Well, you do keep it rare.  Keep it rare.  All right, so Sean Hannity.  What is Ainsley Earhart on his show?  What?  So?  How many body parts is that?  So.  Why do I need to know her name?  It's not for you.  It's for the audience.  What kind of knowledge?  What am I going to do with that knowledge?  You don't have to do anything.  But now the audience knows.  Oh.  And they're saying who gives a fuck, too.  So forget the name then.  Thank you.  It is nine degrees on my phone here. 
[02:42:30]  But if you look at that map that you just showed, Sean, negative six degrees here with the wind.  And so this is the Sean Hannity wet t-shirt contest.  Whoa.  Show us your tits.  Wow.  When did you want that?  Earlier.  But we're going to show you how quickly a t-shirt will freeze.  Watch this.  This bucket is full of water.  We have our Fox News t-shirt here.  By the way, could you pause this?  We're dousing it with water.  I just want everybody to know this did not work like they wanted it to.  Why?  She was hoping this would freeze a lot faster. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, this part?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Because nine degrees is a big difference.  You really need it.  You need, like, below zero, windy, and shit.  And that shit goes a lot faster.  Yes.  Gotcha.  And you see Sean start to get a little concerned.  She doesn't understand basic science is what you're saying.  She does not understand.  She thought it was like a cartoon where you throw a bucket of water on the cartoon cat.  Right.  And all of a sudden he's in a literal block of ice. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that's great.  She kind of thought that's what was going to happen.  All right.  Good spin here.  Yeah.  The no-spin zone.  And it's going to freeze.  Let's see.  No, let's see.  It still looks wet, Ainsley.  She's picking up on that.  It doesn't take long, Sean.  It doesn't take long.  Wow.  Look at this.  It's freezing already.  You can tell.  No, we can't tell.  With a t-shirt that's wet.  While that's getting frozen.  Frozen, yeah.  We have a video of a man throwing water in the air. 
[02:44:00]  It instantly is freezing.  Watch this.  This is fascinating.  Why is it fascinating?  Isn't that incredible?  It's boiling water.  Yeah, and it becomes snow.  Right.  That is kind of cool, I guess.  It was a student.  I was reading about this earlier.  A student was making homemade ice cream.  And they.  She's trying to freeze that shirt.  And they realized that the ice cream froze quickly.  Is she putting it up against her pussy?  The milk was hot.  I was wondering.  I was watching you all on New Year's Eve.  And I was wondering how at some point your mouth has to start freezing and you can't speak.  But that didn't happen. 
[02:44:30]  Look, look.  Oh, no, Sean.  The shirt's not even close to proof.  It's really cold.  We're going to go to our segment.  And we're going to come back by the end of the segment.  Go to our segment.  And we're going to see it.  Is that now frozen?  Yeah, look.  We'll come back.  No, it's not.  We'll get an update on all that.  And while temperatures continue to hit historic lows, it seems as though the freezing cold weather is getting so cold.  It really was an epic failure.  And she was trying the old, you know, intern with the fucking eye patch thing when we made him finally take it off. 
[02:45:00]  And he goes, see, see right here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's nothing going on.  That's what she was doing.  Like, see, it's freezing.  No, it's not freezing.  Yo, search.  It's not.  That guy right there.  Is that search?  No, he did a phoner.  Search?  What?  Who's that guy then?  Who's that?  That looks like search.  No, that's.  It's the guy who runs shape 45.  Is search talking to Brewer?  Oh.  It looks like Brewer and search.  That's Reef.  Oh, that is a great clip.  It wasn't even close to getting. 
[02:45:30]  Not even close.  The t-shirt wasn't close to getting hard.  When she's conveying that compelling story of the guy making ice cream.  Right.  You could see they have her from about the waist up in the shot.  And you see her arms moving down.  She's like trying to fan the shirt to try to get it to freeze.  And nothing.  It doesn't work that way.  No.  All right.  We have Louis C.K., our old pal, Louis C.K.  He was on Leno, huh? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, he did Leno.  What happened?  Last night or the night before.  He was in American Hustle.  Right.  Yes.  I haven't seen American Hustle.  I got a screener.  It's pretty goddamn good.  It's good.  It's really good.  I'll tell you, both the girls in it are very sexy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who were the girls in that?  Jennifer Lawrence in that ass.  Oh, right.  Of course.  And then, what's her name?  I didn't.  Amy Adams.  Amy Adams.  Oh, Amy Adams, too, huh?  Amy Adams looks really sexy in that fucking movie.  The titties look good.  Yeah.  And she had them out for a good movie. 
[02:46:30]  Like, out?  It was really, and she looked very hot.  And then that fucking Hunger Games girl looked really good, too.  Jennifer Lawrence.  She didn't look like the girl from Hunger Games, though.  But she couldn't maintain a Long Island accent at all.  No, it's very hard to do, really.  You've got to be honest.  It's very hard.  She's not good.  One of my favorite roles where a girl had to portray a Long Island accent was the Amy  Fisher movie.  I knew you were going to say that.  Of course.  And it was the one with...  Drew Barrymore?  No. 
[02:47:00]  But Drew Barrymore was terrible in it, too.  No.  Big tits.  Yeah, Jennifer.  Big tits.  My mom wasn't an actress.  My mom has big tits.  Alyssa Milano.  Alyssa Milano.  Big tits.  Alyssa Milano did big tits.  Right.  She had a horrible fake Long Island accent.  Drew Barrymore was bad, too, though.  Can we get a little clip of that?  Of Alyssa Milano's?  Yeah.  I wish.  Which one was that called?  Long Island Lolita?  Or Death at Your Doorstep? 
[02:47:30]  Or fucking...  There were three, right?  Didn't each network?  Yeah, there was three.  I think that was the deal.  They all wanted to make their own.  What are you saying?  All had one.  I believe.  That guy would play Joey.  What a puke.  Remember how great these are?  Calvities of love.  The Long Island Lolita.  Hey, Joe!  Hey, Joe!  It's Joe!  You shaved your beard!  I didn't even drink it! 
[02:48:00]  Oh, this is so bad.  It's me.  It's the old me!  How do you feel?  Great.  Mary and Joe are taking it one day at a time.  And I'm feeling better than ever.  The kids don't come at home.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, they think you've been in Florida on business.  Who is this guy?  I miss them a lot, too.  And what part of the story is this?  My drug addiction is like a disease of the addict.  He's getting cleaned up.  Joey.  Before the shooting?  Oh, yeah.  Is it?  Yeah?  Don't we want the Lolita?  Look at that fucking dude.  We want the Lolitas. 
[02:48:30]  What year was this?  This is the Lolitas.  What year did this movie come out?  I'm going to guess 93.  Oh, look the hell.  That's about right.  This must be this nutcase's daughter.  You know what I want to say?  I think the guy playing Joey Butterfuoco is the guy that wrote the note on Seinfeld for  the massages.  I think he's the doctor that wrote the note and got in trouble.  This must be the kid.  It looks like him.  Hi, how are you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  Uh, I think my father was in here yesterday. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  In here yesterday?  What color did he want?  Let me ask you something.  What color do you want?  Black.  Black would be great.  Black?  We got black.  Well, I kind of got another problem.  I was wondering if I could show it to you guys.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I was backing out of my garage and I kind of like crashed against the side.  Crashed.  No.  It's crashed.  You fucking dumb old.  My mother might make him take the car away.  See, she didn't want him to give me one right away. 
[02:49:30]  Maybe that's not him.  I don't know.  It's not that bad.  No, it's pretty bad if you're from Long Island.  Yeah.  She puts that like crashed.  You don't say crash.  It's crash.  She said fucking crash.  I remember when I got one of those shirts.  Complete auto body.  I went down.  I went down to the fucking shop and got it from Joey himself.  Wow.  I walked in there and I was like, hey, can I get a complete auto body shirt?  And he's like, hey, what are you, extra large?  Because I'm a fucking skinny piece of shit. 
[02:50:00]  Did you pretend you were going to shoot him?  No.  I didn't have a gun.  I was in a fucking work van.  I just pulled up because I was around there and I was like, oh, I'll get one of the shirts.  You'll get one of those.  And I got one.  Fucking Long Island fucking royalty.  Can we see the Drew Barrymore one?  Maybe that's even worse.  I remember these movies.  What an event.  They got huge ratings. 
[02:50:30]  Everybody loved that story.  93-ish.  Yeah, 93.  Oh, man.  Somewhere around there.  What?  It's dubbed.  The Amy Fish.  By the way, that wasn't the doctor.  It wasn't.  No, no.  But he was in A Woman Scorned, the Betty Broderick Story.  Oh.  All right.  Now we're talking.  I don't care if you're Betty Broderick Crawford.  You can't drive this piece of shit on my highway.  Oh, that's it. 
[02:51:00]  I don't care because it's cholesterol.  Honey.  Forget the whole.  Hope you're intending to clean up in there.  Let's go.  I care.  I love you.  I need my pills.  This isn't love.  It's insanity.  Roseanne, my pills.  Shut up.  What is this?  This is a compilation.  Yeah.  Here.  See me.  Here.  Here.  Is she going to talk?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:51:30]  She was good in Poison Ivy.  Real good.  You know who was in there?  Well, nothing.  Tom Skerritt.  Really?  Fucked her on the piano stool.  I'm done with my chores.  My chores.  What do you think you're doing?  Yeah, hers is not good.  Hi.  Hi.  That was good.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Those are great, though.  Oh, I remember the excitement all over Long Island.  That one.  What a great, dumb fucking soap opera that played out for a while. 
[02:52:00]  A long time.  That whole story.  They got all these movies and everything.  Movies.  And then the story continued with, like, Joey fucking, was he getting arrested?  Was he not?  Then he finally did.  And then she accused her lawyer of fucking her or something.  Like, it was literally like soap opera writing.  Yeah.  But it was real life.  Fucking great.  Yeah.  Good old days.  93 was great for those stories.  Oh, yeah.  Like, there was like 90.  And it was.  A current affair was out.  So, it was all that real bad tabloid shit. 
[02:52:30]  It wasn't that it was 93.  It was one after another is what you're trying to say.  Yeah.  So, it was Amy Fisher.  Then it went Tonya Harding.  Yeah.  Then it went O.J.  Yeah.  O.J.  And then there was another one in there, too.  One after another.  Just over the top, crazy ass shit.  There was some good scandal.  There was, what's his name?  That fucking boring English actor.  Fucking the hooker.  Hugh Grant.  Hugh Grant.  Hugh Grant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, yeah, like, like, 92 to 95.  Eddie Murphy with the fucking tranny.  Well, he just got, he just got pulled over dropping, so he didn't get caught, actually. 
[02:53:00]  I'm talking about you.  You don't have to defend him.  Oh, no.  I'm just saying.  Oh, no.  Me.  Believe me.  I think I've never had that nightmare of looking up and seeing fucking squad car lights.  Oh, really?  How do you explain that?  Oh, yeah.  Telltale rap of a fucking, of a police flashlight on the window.  The old mag light tapping on the window.  The universal symbol for, or a hand signal for roll down the window. 
[02:53:30]  Have her put that away?  Have her put that away.  Holy shit.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  I have to clear something up, too.  Oh, what's that?  If you want to do Louis first, I'll do it after.  Oh, let's tease it.  Clear something up.  We'll keep everybody guessing.  We're talking about American Hustle.  Yes.  Oh, right.  What about it?  And Jennifer Lawrence couldn't maintain it.  She didn't do a bad accent.  She couldn't maintain it.  Yeah.  There was a movie I saw recently that couldn't maintain the accent. 
[02:54:00]  Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves?  Nope.  No.  Keep guessing.  Dangerous Mind?  New York accent?  Yep.  Taxi Driver?  Actor or actress?  Both.  Oh, shit.  Actor?  The one with Scarlett Johansson and the other guy?  Holy shit.  Don John?  Holy.  How the fuck did you get that?  Because I saw the trailer for it.  I was voted boy most likely to guess an accent slash movie reference in high school.  Based on a trailer?  No.  Based on a trailer, I think I came in 48. 
[02:54:30]  There's nothing worse.  That's stupid.  There's nothing worse when you know the actors are struggling with the accent and you just  notice.  Yeah.  It's distracting.  Some of these people are flawless and you don't even think about it whatsoever.  I don't know what it is that does that.  It's like Sons of Anarchy.  The lead guy on that show is like British.  Right.  And as the seasons have gone on, it's gotten worse.  Oh, really?  You're just giving up on it.  It's a British accent that comes through more and more.  Yeah.  You nailed it, though.  Don Juan, which was... 
[02:55:00]  Don John.  Don John.  Yeah, look out.  They put a little spin on it.  Oh, I see.  Movie stunk.  I watched some of it in Atlantic City.  It's horrible.  I watched it from start to finish.  And what's his name who has a second career going?  He wrote that thing, right?  Joey Gordon-Levitt wrote and directed it.  And directed it.  Scarlett Johansson was horrible in that.  Everybody was terrible in it.  Except Tony Danza.  Tony Danza was pretty good.  That was pretty interesting.  But he was in here and barely promoted that he was in that movie, if you remember.  He knew it.  And he goes, oh, yeah.  Well, I'm also in this movie, Don John. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He was a...  But he was a pig, man.  It was hilarious.  It's always weird to see him in those weird roles.  He was just looking at her ass.  Like, he brings Scarlett Johansson to, you know, mom and dad's house.  And Tony Danza's playing the father.  And he's just creeping the whole time.  Yeah, you know, like a wife beater on or something.  Yeah.  And he's looking at her ass as she's walking out of the room.  And then he's looking at her crotch in church.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then the movie made no sense.  It was stupid.  Then the ending... 
[02:56:00]  I don't know.  Maybe people want to see it.  Yeah, I didn't...  It actually looked good in the trailer, but I have seen nothing but the trailer.  Basically, the guy can't stop jerking off and looking at porn.  It just kind of messes up his life.  But in the end...  Then he figures out what real sex is and real love, I guess.  It kind of says nothing in the end, though.  Like, it just sits there.  Yeah, I think so, too.  It did see the end.  You're right.  Yeah.  But anyway, American Hustle, Louis C.K.  And Louis is great in that movie, by the way.  I'm starting to think that Louis is becoming a huge star. 
[02:56:30]  He's getting there.  I'm starting to think.  He's on the upswing.  There's some rumbling that might be working out for him.  He's making a splash.  Oh, my God.  Is he a cannonball?  He tells a story in the movie about ice fishing.  Okay.  Yes.  That we never get the ending of.  Never get the end.  Okay.  So he went on Leno and talked about that.  Oh, okay.  I had very little to do in the movie, originally.  In the script, I just said, like, a few lines.  But then I got to the set and he said, 
[02:57:00]  I want you to tell a story about ice fishing throughout the whole movie.  And I was like, what?  And so he just made it up.  Right.  Just like, I swear, he thought, you know what?  Tell an ice fishing story.  And I'm like, what?  So we made up this ice fishing story as we went along.  As we shot the movie, I'd tell a little bit more.  And then the next scene we'd shoot, he'd be like,  so what happens next, do you think, in the ice fishing story?  I'm like, I don't know.  Oh, this is your idea.  So we just kept telling.  And then he didn't use the ending.  There is an ending.  Oh, there is an ending.  Yeah.  Because people always ask me now in the streets, 
[02:57:30]  what's the end of the ice fishing story?  What is the ending?  The story is that me and my brother, the brother of the character,  are out on the ice, and it's too early to be ice fishing,  and our dad is coming, and it's very dramatic.  And the ending is that the kid, the brother, took a dump on the ice.  Took a big, that's the ending.  He took a big anger dump on the ice,  and then it melted into the ice, and it's stuck in there through the whole winter,  and it created like a fissure between my father and brother, 
[02:58:00]  and I was stuck in the middle.  You know, that's what happened.  That's the end of the ice fishing story.  I can honestly say I'm sorry I asked.  That's kind of nice to know.  I was wondering about that ice fishing.  I never would have guessed that.  I didn't see it going.  No, I haven't seen the movie yet.  I haven't seen it at all.  Now you see it in a whole other context.  Yeah.  When you see it.  We got a lot of movies to watch at all.  Holy shit, that's definitely search.  That's just some fat guy who works here.  That wasn't search either? 
[02:58:30]  No.  Fuck.  No.  I don't think search is coming in today, huh?  It was a phoner?  It was a phoner.  It's already done.  Oh, oh.  Can you keep it real on the phone, though?  I don't really.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think you can.  No.  I don't think so.  That's a shame.  I don't really think you can.  No way.  Keeping it.  Oh, Jimmy's got something.  Jimmy.  Yeah, yesterday I was, you know, I have a love-hate with some of the fans,  because some of them just get it so wrong, some fucking dumb twats on Reddit. 
[02:59:00]  Well, they just want to hear what they want to hear.  They don't listen.  But Chris, I had gotten, I had done Chris Hardwick's podcast a while ago in August  to promote my special.  Oh, yes.  And my publicist, I don't even know if she had tried, or I asked her to, and she's like,  well, it's a few months.  They book really far in advance.  So I just texted Chris and said, if you can, and they had me on, which I felt good about.  It's a massive podcast, and I did all the podcasts when I was out there.  And then it didn't air.  So I was getting, like, these texts from people, or tweets from fans going, hey, when 
[02:59:30]  did you know this podcast, Andy?  Yeah.  So I was like, well, I don't know.  And so I asked my manager, and he said, oh, you know, Jim, they said they're going to.  Hey, yes, hey, you know, that's just more fucking, more non-committal nonsense.  So then yesterday, I found out, like, while we were on the air, that it just came out  this week, because I got a bunch of Nerdist tweets.  And so it annoyed me, like, fuck, man, like, why'd they wait five months?  Yeah, yeah, because you could use it, you know, when you needed it.  Yeah, but, and so I complained about that, but I didn't, and I went out of my way to say, 
[03:00:00]  I'm not going to motherfuck Hardwick, and I didn't motherfuck Chris Hardwick.  I was bothered by it, because I'm like, we've had the guy on, and why would he, like, I felt  like, ah, he didn't want me on, but he just did it to be polite.  So I kind of felt like a douche more than, like, I would have rather he said no than just  have me on to be polite.  And then, and I've seen his list of, he gets really good guests.  He said Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks.  I'm not delusional, where I expect to be bumped, to bump those, I'm not a fucking dummy. 
[03:00:30]  But anyway, I didn't motherfuck Chris, I was just bummed about it, and like, shit, why  did he have me on if he didn't want me?  But anyway, you know, of course, in translation, so Chris wrote me a really nice email, and he  addressed it on Reddit.  He's a really nice guy, and he said, sorry, and it was just a big mix-up.  And he said, truthfully, he goes, I just, I wasn't thinking about the start date.  And we had a bunch of people we had already committed to run certain dates, because you  have to commit to them, and I basically just put you in the evergreen thing, because I  wasn't thinking, and I apologize. 
[03:01:00]  So, you know, of course, it was just a mix-up.  I bet the fans were very sympathetic of that.  But he said something that was right.  He goes, dude, if you had a problem, I wish you could have just reached out to me.  And I normally would have.  I just literally yesterday got it while I was on the air, and I reacted.  So I apologize for doing that.  I should have at least had the courtesy to reach out to Chris personally first.  But, you know, any fans that are saying I motherfucked a guy, believe me, if I was going to  motherfuck him, I would have.  And that wasn't what it was.  I really was more annoyed at my management for the lack of information coming in. 
[03:01:30]  And I just was very frustrated with that.  Like, if Jonathan had told me, hey, yeah, we talked to them, and Jonathan was just like,  oh, no, no, I get a call in.  Like, we're just more of this fucking vaguely.  So, anyway, thank you for the email, Chris.  And I should have reached out to you first, and I do appreciate you reaching out to me.  Thank you.  So, obviously, we have a major problem with Chris.  Is it funny how that stuff works?  That's what I heard. 
[03:02:00]  I'm just being a listener now.  What?  We have a major problem, right?  It's a major problem.  And I've motherfucked people, and I never think it's ambiguous when I motherfuck somebody.  Yeah, yeah, it's pretty obvious.  Yeah, I never think that I'm that subtle when I truly motherfuck someone.  So, you've got to work on your subtlety, I think.  You know what I mean?  You're not that subtle.  You're not that subtle.  You're not that obvious.  I try.  People usually know where I stand on things, and I was just more disappointed.  You know?  Look, I'm going to put it.  And then if you show, like, ah, fuck me, I feel kind of shitty about that, like a dick,  or like, I just feel like he was being polite, and I'm slightly embarrassed by that. 
[03:02:30]  Then people are like, oh, he's a fucking pussy.  But then again, if you have no feelings about something, you're an asshole.  You can't win.  There's no winning.  Nuts with the anonymous.  Yeah, yeah.  There's only a few of the people.  I disagree.  There is winning.  Know how we win?  Block?  No, look at our bank accounts.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  Oh, that's an elitist point of view.  You're a one percenter.  Am I?  Oh, search. 
[03:03:00]  Really?  That's a club soda candy.  No, dude, right there.  No, he's right there.  Around the corner.  Yo, search.  He's right there.  You got your A.  Here he is.  That's actually our talent booker, Roland.  Oh.  That's Roland.  Oh, I thought that was search without his glasses.  Yeah, no, that's Roland.  Different.  That's different.  Quite different.  More big acts are leading the SeaWorld people.  I saw that.  I guess one of the airlines, what was that, Southwest? 
[03:03:30]  They painted a big fucking killer whale and made one of their planes look like SeaWorld  killer whale, and I guess people are pissed.  Wait, they're mad at Southwest?  L.A. Southwest.  I guess they took some advertising or something like that.  SeaWorld's going to have no choice.  They're going to have to get rid of the killer whales.  And do they have a business at that point?  I used to love going to SeaWorld down in Florida with my little nephew.  It's not just that.  It's the dolphins, and then it's the fucking...  But the killer whales is the big attraction for those. 
[03:04:00]  We've never taken a mother from her...  And I'm thinking, who has more of a motive to lie?  Some documentary people, they get all of these ex-employees to work, or the company that's  going to lose millions.  Yep.  So I think it's the company with more motives to work.  And then recently they had a vote on CNN, I think it was.  Right.  Do you think that the documentary had any effect on whether you would go to SeaWorld or not?  Right.  And the no one, the no, it was like, no, it wouldn't have an effect. 
[03:04:30]  I'd still go.  And then they noticed a lot of the same IP addresses.  No way.  Oh, really?  It came from one of SeaWorld's computers.  Come on.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  That was one of yours.  No, it wasn't.  That was so bad.  No, it wasn't.  Who was it?  Oh, no.  It was Opie.  God damn it.  I'm laughing, but no.  I don't really...  I think Jim's acting.  Yeah, I think you're acting.  When am I ever destroyed the night of fire?  You've always done.  My farting's way down.  That was really bad, Jimmy.  Oh, my God. 
[03:05:00]  My nose picking and my farting is way down.  That's an excellent line if you ever put on a singles head again.  It's way down.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  That is yours.  It's so bad.  I know yours.  Yeah.  That is so yours.  I know it's one of mine.  I'm looking at two tents in the front of the jeans.  That's what it is.  Oh, my God.  It's got that hint of jizz smell to it.  That's not my burp.  I believe we're talking 9% alcohol on this one. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You think?  Yeah, it's an IPA.  It's a six points fucking...  I think it's a six point.  Okay.  With a hint of vanilla.  Yuck.  What happened?  Somebody on Reddit just posted, who's following MC Search?  What?  On Twitter, who's following MC Search?  Let me see.  It's just followed by...  Followed by...  Is Joe DeRosa really following him?  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Because Joe DeRosa's a big hip-hop man.  Joe's a hip-hop guy.  I bet Joe like fucking like...  Wow, they really look the same, man.  I bet back in the day, Joe thought he was like...  I mean, they're a big, important...  That's funny.  It's part of a group.  Yeah.  I've got a weasel.  You know one act that's not going to blow off SeaWorld?  What act?  First supergroup Asia.  No, they won't.  They're not going to blow off fucking SeaWorld.  They have loyalty.  They understand. 
[03:06:30]  Did you hear Iraq rapping yesterday?  I heard that.  Oh, my God.  How is he rapping?  His mouth around a hoagie.  Never ends.  I did.  He was rapping some third base.  He knows all the words.  The pop goes hop.  He goes the weasel.  Why would you give us that clip for the regular show?  Uh-oh.  That's some shit we need.  Because he needs material for the pre-post show.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know what I'm doing. 
[03:07:00]  Whatever it is.  But, yeah, that was entertainment, man.  I was listening, and I thought, holy fuck, Iraq's fucking.  He was spitting some fucking shit there.  Some rhymes?  Yes.  Dope beats?  Can we have that for tomorrow?  Dope.  We have it right now.  No, we're going home.  Well, that's okay.  We're going home.  You can definitely have it for tomorrow.  Thank you, man.  And we've got to do the secrets of the living dolls.  Man dresses as a female doll and lives his life.  Living dolls? 
[03:07:30]  I saw some of that.  Like, I was looking online, but I hate that my iPhone just doesn't play some shit.  You hit the fucking video, and it's like, oh, thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  And, yeah, I wanted to see that.  When guys dress like girls, Jimmy, a lot of times they don't look like women.  So I guess they decided to do this thing where they encase themselves completely in a doll kind of a costume.  It's all rubber.  Like, rubber face, rubber fucking body, rubber everything, like a doll. 
[03:08:00]  They look like a real doll.  It looks crazy.  Wait, can I just see that really fast?  That sounds creepy.  They look like fucking monsters.  It sounds like some serial killer shit.  Yes, it's nightmarish.  And what, this is becoming a thing?  I don't know how big a thing it's becoming, but it is creepy looking.  Is it like the Furbies or the whatever?  What were they?  Furries?  The Furries.  Furries, yeah.  Remember the Furries?  You were supposed to go to one of those conventions?  Oh. 
[03:08:30]  Look at this.  Dude, they look fucking frightening.  What the fuck?  Can you imagine that thing, like, peeking in a window?  You fucking drop dead.  All right, we're really going to get into this tomorrow.  It's a whole face mask and body covering thing.  They're complete rubber, like a doll.  And they, you know.  What the fuck is going on out there?  There's some weird people out there. 
[03:09:00]  Got to say.  And that's what we'll be presenting tomorrow's broadcast.  James?  This wonderful program.  Yes, I might as well plug now.  Um, Friday, uh, my Pittsburgh, uh, tickets go on sale if you want for February 28th.  And then this weekend, I'm in Raleigh at Good Nights.  And then January 23 through 25, Atlanta.  February 6th through 8, D.C.  And then A.C.  14th of February.  15th is sold out.  I like saying two pickets to Titsburg. 
[03:09:30]  How funny is that, right?  Good one.  Yeah.  That's fun.  See you tomorrow later.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments of today's show.  Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
