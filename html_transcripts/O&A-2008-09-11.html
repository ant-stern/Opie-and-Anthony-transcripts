<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began by marking the seventh anniversary of 9/11, contrasting the news media's fleeting solemnity with their own intention to maintain their usual provocative comedic style.  They mocked the somber tone and music employed by news channels, pointing out the inconsistent levels of global remembrance for this and other significant events like the Madrid train bombing and the 2004 tsunami.  They also discussed their own past controversies and firing, comparing the public's memory of that event to the ongoing remembrance of 9/11.  Jim Norton, along with Robert Kelly (in studio), recounted a disappointing experience at the *Righteous Kill* premiere, criticizing the film and the actors' performances.  Norton shared a funny anecdote about kissing Kelly on the red carpet.  Colin Quinn called in to contribute to the banter.  The hosts peppered the conversation with offensive jokes targeting various sensitive topics.

The show then transitioned to discussions of sports injuries, contrasting Opie's knee injury with those of professional athletes.  This segued into further criticism of *Righteous Kill*, including speculation on which actor died in the film.  A significant portion focused on the book "101 Places You Should Have Sex Before You Die," specifically its suggestion of a church confessional, drawing parallels to their past controversial stunt.  Political commentary followed, centered around Barack Obama's "lipstick on a pig" comment, with listener calls and debate on its meaning and electoral impact, along with a discussion of an election bet.  The segment ended with anecdotes about celebrity encounters (including Al Pacino and Robert De Niro), observations on their aging appearances, and a “Primetime Gossip” segment about a producer's injuries.  The entire segment was punctuated by frequent vulgar language and sexual references.  Besides the regular hosts and Kelly, other staff members like "Stump Brain," "E-Rock" (or Sexbagel), were mentioned.

A later segment opened with nonsensical banter, leading to a caller’s story about seeing a surprisingly short Al Pacino.  This sparked a discussion about actors' heights and filmmaking techniques used to adjust for them, transitioning into further discussion and playing a clip of an awkward Al Pacino and Robert De Niro interview, which the hosts heavily criticized.  A caller mentioned forced perspective in *Back to the Future*, followed by more commentary on the stilted interview.  The conversation then shifted to Marc Maron's recent divorce, discussed with frank details of his emotional and legal struggles, and his subsequent dating life.  The hosts interjected with jokes and personal anecdotes, mentioning Maron's upcoming appearance on the show.  The segment concluded with more riffing on the Pacino/De Niro interview, a caller's comment on MSNBC's 9/11 coverage, and criticism of Keith Olbermann's perceived hypocrisy.  The segment ended with more jokes and mentions of upcoming events, with Roland and other guests in studio.  Vulgar language and crude humor were prevalent.


The show then addressed the lingering smell from 9/11 and the resulting influx of people, followed by a discussion of a live feed of the 9/11 attacks playing nearby, which they found disturbing.  The arrival of adult film stars Brie Olsen and Caden Cross was announced, leading to a sexually explicit conversation.  Olsen revealed she started in the industry at 12 after an encounter with an older neighbor.  The hosts reacted with shock and continued the explicit discussion.  The segment focused heavily on Olsen's physical appearance, with sexually suggestive comments.  A running joke involved finding a man with a wedding ring to interact with Olsen, resulting in a failed street segment.  The segment ended with a discussion of Olsen’s apparent crush on Jimmy Norton.

This led to a lengthy, sexually charged interaction between the hosts and Olsen, focusing on her crush on Norton and his reluctance to pursue it.  The conversation involved explicit descriptions of Olsen's body, speculation about a potential encounter, and vulgar suggestions from the hosts.  Listener calls contributed to the discussion.  The segment culminated in Olsen, topless and partially undressed, sitting on Norton's lap while the hosts and a guest, Bobby, made sexually explicit remarks.  The show then promoted upcoming appearances at adult entertainment events.

The final segment depicted Olsen performing a sex act on a male co-host, Earl, in the studio, with Opie, Anthony, and Dr. Jimmy providing commentary and crude jokes.  The event involved manual stimulation and resulted in Earl's ejaculation.  The segment included numerous sexual references, descriptions, and offensive language, with discussions of other radio shows (Ron and Fez) and sponsors.  The closing moments included further sexually explicit comments and a humorous reading of a listener letter, promoting upcoming live appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, I'm going to start breaking stuff.  Seriously.  Watch this.  All right.  Now we need a new one.  Now we need a new one.  Oops.  Just slow in there.  All right, and now Pat's blowing.  Wait, no, not yet.  Hold on.  Please, hurry.  Ready?  Yes.  I wanted you to smell this if it smelled like Elio's pizza. 
[00:01:00]  That's all.  That's all for us.  This is hysterical.  Hold on, everybody.  Here she goes, go.  Holy crap.  It's more than just your life you're hurting.  Think about your family.  Think about your friends.  Think beyond the moment.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  I love that clip.  I hate that clip.  Why, it's helpful.  It's helpful.  Go at yourself.  You've got to think about those things.  It's so helpful.  It's helpful.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Thursday already?  It rocks.  Well, it's 9-11.  Yeah.  It's not that 9-11, though.  Huh?  It's not that 9-11, though. 
[00:02:00]  It's seven years after.  Well, you know, the news, though.  They got their dark clothes on today here in New York City.  Yes.  And they're doing the somber music in and out of breaks.  They brought their black suits, black dresses out, and all the news things when you usually  hear like, ba-da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, the news, da-da-da.  They're all, bling, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  We're here.  It is 9-11 today.  We're remembering 9-11 today by breaking out our suits we wear once a year. 
[00:02:30]  Our dark-colored suits.  The dark-colored suits.  No joking today.  No joking.  No squirrels water skiing.  No laughing.  Right.  No water skiing.  No skateboarding bulldogs.  No surfing dogs.  Just somberness.  Remembrance.  And we pay tribute to the fallen by gathering 8 billion news trucks around Ground Zero with  their booms up and all the bright lights on our stupid reporters. 
[00:03:00]  That's how we pay tribute.  Aren't they calling it, like, what, a very special or what were they saying?  A special edition of the news, yeah.  It's a special edition of the news.  What makes it special?  That they're wearing suits and playing somber music in between commercials.  They probably do the news the way they should, without really sensationalizing it.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  They're just boring and dull.  So it's dull.  Like the way the news should be.  Look at Smug Guy.  Is he going to a funeral?  He's got the dark suit. 
[00:03:30]  Look at this guy.  Smug Guy's just like, yeah.  So predictable.  The news director is, okay, everyone has to wear dark suits on 9-11.  Why?  Back to you in the studio.  I mean, it sucks.  It's a day that no one's going to forget.  We all know that.  We were broadcasting that day.  But what is this?  I'm walking past the poor Smug Guy.  Look at this guy.  They're phony, dark suits right now.  Every local news channel here in New York, they got, look at this, over here.  Everywhere you look, it's a dark.  They're all wearing dark clothing.  Yes, it's somber.  So effing predictable.  It's somber.  And then tomorrow, it'll be back to da-da-da. 
[00:04:00]  Da-da-da.  Well, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Da-da-da-da-da.  What are they up to?  Holy jeez.  All right.  Back to the lipstick and the pig thing.  All right.  We're over that crap of 9-11.  Yeah.  That's how they look at it.  One day of this.  Let's not forget until tomorrow morning.  And then it's good.  All hell breaks loose.  And back to the wacky news.  Don't dress like Master Poe today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, look.  You got to acknowledge it.  It sucks.  You know.  Yeah.  You know.  I kind of was like, meh.  You kind of feel like all bleh.  Because you do remember exactly what it was like.  But, you know.  Could you build something there?  For God's sake, just build something.  I know they built around it very nicely.  Some of the buildings over there are amazing.  But, like, come on.  Now it's the last.  I think this is the last year they finally said, look. 
[00:05:00]  The last year that the family is going to be able to go into the actual site.  Because, you know.  They got to build something there.  Why?  Just put.  I don't care what it is.  A hundred story Arby's.  I want something.  An Arby's.  I'm sick and tired of that hole.  I know.  It's the worst thing.  That's the worst thing.  Because it's just a constant reminder.  I remind you to drive down the West Side Highway and you look over and just go, oh, God.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  Well, we're going to do our regular show today. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  That's what we do.  I was supposed to be on Fox 10 on Fox Red Eye.  But they canceled yesterday.  They didn't.  But the network is like they're running some kind of a.  You know, they're doing something for a 9-11.  Really?  Really?  They're all capitalizing on it is what they're doing.  Yeah.  This is a.  You know.  Unsensational sensationalization of it.  Of course.  They know a lot more people are going to be checking out like news programs today.  And they're going to, you know, try to get as many viewers as possible.  One thing I'm glad of is they don't really show the whole thing again. 
[00:06:00]  It's like.  If you want to see that, you could tune into documentaries that Discovery is running and other channels.  But the news, when they just pound you over and over again with that image, it's like.  All right.  Believe me.  It's burnt in my head.  I don't think I need to see it 800 more times.  Because I do remember.  They want to show the footage.  So bad.  Oh, you know they do.  So bad they want to show that footage.  Yeah.  They want to open up with that.  Yeah.  They want that as the bumper in and out of their news today. 
[00:06:30]  Tough day for the cabbies today and everything.  They're just getting.  You know how that is.  Remember the poor cabbies?  The like Sikh cabbies that wear the turbans and have nothing to do with the terrorism or anything.  Hey, we didn't know back then.  It's just like, hey, you turban wearing rag.  Come here.  People are getting beaten up.  And it's just like, I'm Indian.  I don't know what you're trying to understand. 
[00:07:00]  How are we supposed to know?  Yeah.  We needed to crush some skulls.  It taught us a little bit.  We didn't know.  We learned about another culture by beating them up.  There was confusion.  Go after those guys or the dude with the Red Sox hat on.  We didn't know.  Yeah.  Oh, is this really?  All right, listen.  This is exactly what we're talking about.  Oh, okay.  This is the stuff that does drive me crazy, anyway.  I'm sure it drives Anthony and everyone else crazy, too.  It's just how they're just such phonies, because tomorrow they'll be back to, like we said, da-da-da-da. 
[00:07:30]  Yada-da-da-da.  Live from New York City, you're watching the CW 11 Morning News.  Hey, that's a look at downtown.  Wednesday, September 10th, folks.  Good Wednesday morning to you.  That was yesterday?  That was yesterday?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We heard the da-da-da-da-da-da.  Hey, good morning to you.  Okay.  It's September 10th.  Oh, okay.  How you doing?  I just panicked.  I'm like, this isn't going to prove our point at all. 
[00:08:00]  But it proves it betterer.  And then I heard September 10th.  I'm like, whew.  I started sweating.  They're going to think we're crazy out there.  And then here's today, the exact same news.  It's the same song.  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Craig Treadway.  And I'm Tiffany McElroy.  This is a special edition of the CW 11 Morning News.  As the world marks seven years since the September 11th attacks. 
[00:08:30]  The world?  The world marks it?  Let me tell you a little story about someone I know from Canada.  I heard a story about an EMT friend that wasn't going to be able to come by and hang out.  And it was conveyed to me by this Canadian friend.  He said, apparently, a bunch of his friends died like seven years ago.  And they're having a memorial.  And then she says, something happened. 
[00:09:00]  I was like, wait, I go, wait, tomorrow's 9-11.  Oh, oh, yeah.  So the world doesn't, the world doesn't know.  The world doesn't care.  Do you, give me the date of the train bombing in Spain.  February 17th.  Shut up.  It is not.  You can't.  You were too serious, Jimmy.  I've seen the thing.  Of course, the body count wasn't nearly as high as 9-11. 
[00:09:30]  But that's a huge terrorist event that happened.  We don't, we're not this big united ball of humanity on this planet.  We hate each other.  Wait a minute.  You're going to teach me something today.  You're convinced that most of the world doesn't know the actual date.  They know the event.  They'll know the date, but they won't instantly, like, wake up this morning and go, oh, my God, it was seven years ago.  They don't care.  The rest of the world doesn't care.  It's not like we do.  Even the rest of the country has this, you know, volume knob of caring, depending on where you're from. 
[00:10:00]  New York, if you were here, obviously, you remember very vividly everything that happened.  If you're in bum crap Oklahoma somewhere, it's not going to affect you as much.  You weren't right there.  You weren't seeing the smoke, smelling the fire and the awful dead smell and all that stuff.  It just doesn't affect you as much.  And the rest of the world, forget about it.  First of all, they can't stand us, most of them. 
[00:10:30]  And secondly, they just, it's another day to them.  They don't take it as much as we do.  They make a big deal.  They think their news things are like, somber day, very somber here in Russia, wearing black  clothes.  They don't care.  Except in maybe Saudi Arabia.  I feel like the very sad, somber day.  It was seven years ago.  We lost 19 young men.  Yeah, exactly.  You bunch of savages.  Oh, those Saudis.  Bunch of phonies. 
[00:11:00]  The worst.  The worst.  Walking, holding hands with the president.  Mo.  You mo's.  You're a big nation of mo's is what you are.  Take your dress off.  You wear pajamas.  You wear William Frawley pajamas from I Love Lucy.  You wear all day.  It was the night before Christmas.  Yeah, that's the day you wear.  Yeah, but people don't. 
[00:11:30]  It's not a big worldwide thing.  We're not united in this as humans.  People don't like us.  We hate other nations.  They hate us.  Hey, what was the, we can't remember the exact Katrina date or the exact date for, how about  that tsunami that killed 200,000 people?  There you go.  200,000 people dead.  What day was that on?  What was the date?  Without going to the internet, stunt brain.  September 26th.  Oh, stop.  Oh, yeah.  Because it was right after Christmas?  I think he's right. 
[00:12:00]  It was right after Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho.  Yeah, but what country was it in?  Indonesia.  Ah.  One of those.  Exactly.  South.  But in that country, they know that day.  And they're celebrating, not celebrating, they acknowledge the anniversary.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think on December 26th, you're going to be like, oh my God, it's December 26th.  This was the big tsunami day.  You make a great point, because I really thought the whole world would know September 11th.  They know it, but it's not acknowledged. 
[00:12:30]  It's in their papers today.  Yeah.  But they're not waking up.  Yeah, they have to go, oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.  Like, a few days ago, it started, like, hitting me, like, wow, seven years.  Oh, God.  And you start remembering, you know, the whole day.  And then the closer you get, like, this morning I woke up and was kind of like, it's the 11th.  It does still, like, kind of bum me out and stuff.  But it's, the rest of the world, they don't care.  We're so self-centered.  We really are. 
[00:13:00]  As the world looks back.  When the news said that.  The world looks back.  No, they're not looking back.  No.  They got their own problems.  Yeah.  And their own country.  I don't know if there were a couple of earthquakes in Japan.  I think they're more concerned with that today.  Yeah.  Korea's trying to figure out if their leader's dead or not.  I know.  Oh, what do you got there?  What?  There's the front page of bbc.  Well, I guess, .uk.  Yeah.  And there's no mention of September 11th.  No.  It's just, it's business as usual.  It's BBC.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  We act like the whole world is wearing a ribbon. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, exactly.  They're not.  Nope.  And that news music, by the way, that was like Showtime softcore porn music.  You know how many times I've scrapped the tunes like that?  It was, that was, the news tune also.  It was the same song, just rearranged in a very somber way.  You could hear the same notes.  Sounds like a crappy Sting song.  Like a crappy Sting song.  Like after you get past the hits of his CD, you're trying to listen to the rest of the CD  and realize, wow, the rest of this is clap. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Is that the same?  That's Sting, Desert Rose.  It kind of reminds me of it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Welcome to this newscast here.  A very special day, September 11th, 2008, marking the 7th anniversary.  Anthony and I are wearing dark clothes today.  Very black.  I actually went over Earl's house and used his clothing.  Yes, linger longer.  Yes, linger longer.  We got our dark clothes, our somber music. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  But tomorrow we'll be right back to the dick jokes and the racism.  But today, we pause to remember this special day.  Yes, we're going to take a break from making fun of retarded people today.  That's right.  To look back.  No waterhead jokes today.  No, no, no.  But definitely tomorrow we'll be back with that.  No, no.  No attempting to do Asian jokes that will absolutely be dumped out of the broadcast.  We won't even try today.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  But tomorrow, business as usual. 
[00:15:00]  Business as usual.  I will not, you won't hear one George Harrison Puddinghead brain tumor joke today.  No.  Because we are looking back in remembrance.  Very somber.  Very somber.  Yes.  Any AIDS references will be met with quiet reverence afterwards.  Yes, yes.  A moment of silence after every AIDS reference, which means a moment of silence every three minutes.  Might as well go dark for four hours.  Yes.  Just turn the show off now. 
[00:15:30]  God.  It sucks.  Let's be honest.  But the crap the news is pulling is ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's every year.  Who are they pulling?  Pull last year's news.  It's the same broadcast.  Yeah.  But tomorrow, that's what Sam will do.  Tuesday, Wednesday.  Oh, wait.  What are we?  Thursday?  Thursday, yeah.  Okay.  So we'll do Wednesday's intro like we did.  Today's intro.  And then tomorrow's intro.  Come on, they son, they wins, they thars, they fried.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  We got to take a break.  We got so much to do today.  I guess we're all over the news today because there's a sex book out there.  So they're referencing our little gag we did back in the day.  Great.  Let's not forget that either.  Look, no one woke up August, uh, August, uh...  Oh, August, uh...  Second?  22nd.  No, that's when we got fired.  August 11th.  August 11th.  I believe it was August 11th.  No one woke up August 11th and said, it was six years ago today that those dopes did the sex thing in the church. 
[00:16:30]  And when did we get fired?  August 22nd.  See, August 22nd, we should have done a somber broadcast.  This is the day we lost.  But in our world...  The Opie and Anthony show of 1.0.  Right.  In our world, that's a...  You know, it's very important.  Yes.  I woke up that day knowing exactly what day it was.  No one else did.  That's for sure.  Man, you make a great point, Ant.  Oh, of course I do.  You really do.  Because I think as Americans, we truly believe that the whole world is behind us.  The whole world is in mourning.  No.  And thinking about us today.  And it's just not the truth. 
[00:17:00]  But anyway, we're part of a story about a sex book.  We got Obama on Letterman.  We got Matt Damon trashing Sarah Palin.  Matt Damon.  We got Joe Biden asking someone in a wheelchair to stand up.  Great YouTube video.  All right, Joe.  And when we get back, Jimmy went to the Al Pacino, Robert De Niro movie premiere.  I want to know if the movie was good!  Jimmy came in early.  Jimmy never comes in early. 
[00:17:30]  Here's a little ad for it.  He was so excited.  I couldn't sleep.  He was so excited to come in and talk about the movie.  He got to go to the premiere last night.  Oh, that was a cool scene, actually.  Right?  No, it wasn't.  It was.  I can't wait.  I think they called that one Banal Dialogue 6.  Oh, boy.  I can't wait.  I cannot wait to hear it, either.  And my date's coming in, too.  Oh, your date?  Well, who are we seeing?  Is he here?  Okay.  Who's the young lady, Rupert? 
[00:18:00]  I'd like to meet her.  We'll meet Jim Norton's date for the big movie premiere of the Al Pacino and Robert De Niro movie.  What a tease.  We did ask Jimmy how was the movie, and he started talking about how great his seats were for the movie.  So I don't think that's a good sign.  Never a good sign when the seats are the highlight of the movie.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get into that next.  It's Opie and Anthony starring Jim Norton.  Welcome back to a very special Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi.  Of course.  Celebrating on this Thursday.  Not celebrating.  Oh, my God.  Why the hell would you say celebrate on such a somber day, Anthony?  Um, actually celebrating, uh, the, uh, the news and how, uh, how they, uh, commemorate.  I'm celebrating their commemorating.  That's right. 
[00:19:00]  Ah, phew.  This is how we acknowledge that this is a horrific day for a lot of people.  Yes.  Somber music.  No dick jokes.  No waterhead jokes.  No, we just play stupid, retarded Forrest Gump music.  And just, uh...  Isn't this Forrest Gump's music?  And just lower our voices.  Yes.  No racism today.  We're all one.  Sorry, Anthony.  You gotta deal with that today.  I like the scene in Forrest Gump where the gust of wind blew his brain out and had it blow  all over the place.  Symbolically. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, wait.  That was a feather.  Hey, hey, hey.  Tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I made a retarded joke.  Yeah.  I just saw that it was, you know, a little after six, uh, before 630 and knew that our retard  joke quota was way down.  Way down today.  Way down.  Way down.  Way down.  We'll be back to all that tomorrow.  I like when they pelted his stupid head with fruit.  Hey, hey.  Oh.  Hey, hey, hey.  How great was that?  His cripple shoes.  Hey, hey, hey.  Nice metal shoes, dick.  They're his magic shoes. 
[00:20:00]  Exactly.  All right.  Hey, uh, Opiate Anthony.  877-212-ON-DA.  You get the point.  We're acknowledging that the news is just, they're just a bunch of dopes.  Phonies.  A bunch of phonies with their dark, I'm going to a funeral suits today.  Yeah.  But tomorrow it'll be bright colors and da-da-da-da and all sorts of crazy, wacky stories for everybody.  But today you got to take it serious.  Yes.  You're the dopey local news.  Shut up.  Speaking of funerals.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, what a segue.  Wow.  Jimmy went to a funeral last night with Robert Kelly, who's live in studio with us today.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Bobby was my date.  Bobby was your date, yeah.  I didn't know I was his date until we hit the red carpet.  You ever just go along with something, the next day wake up and go, did I do that?  You went on the red carpet as Jim Norton's lover?  Jim grabbed me and held me and kissed my face.  Kissed his cheek a little, his head.  A little?  I took a lot of pictures of it.  Yeah? 
[00:21:00]  Let me tell you something.  A lot?  Yeah.  Dude, I felt like Phelps just won the eighth gold medal.  Just, look this way, look this way.  And I'm just smiling as he's kissing my cheek.  Oh, I hope these pictures show up somewhere.  Somewhere.  Some one of them will.  I turned into the bottom real quick.  I assumed that role very quick with little Jimmy.  He has a force about him.  You will do stupid things on the red carpet.  Like, you just throw everything out the window. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, it was hilarious, but I really, I woke up this morning and I looked at my wife and  I was like, I have a wife.  Why would I do that?  Why did I do that?  Jimmy's just forceful.  Well, let's get into this.  So, what is it?  Righteous Kill is the name of the Al Pacino, Robert De Niro movie.  Who's getting the top billing?  De Niro?  De Niro's first, but it's seen as equal billing, though.  Equal billing?  Okay.  Yeah.  His name is first, but you're not thinking, you're thinking it's the two of them together.  Okay.  And we get there and Roland's on line waiting for the tickets. 
[00:22:00]  And surprisingly, there's no glitches with the tickets.  And he finds out that I'm on the red carpet list to go through the red carpet.  So, I do, just because I want to sneak a camera in, you know, and you can't bring a camera  in.  So, I want to bring my camera in.  So, I'm like, on the red carpet, they won't check here.  So, I go and I bring Bob, because I'm like, the two of us will probably get pictures taken  more than I will.  Because I've walked on those before, where a couple of them will politely snap your photo.  And Dave's horrifying.  Oh.  Cheek.  Cheek.  So, you get one Polaroid going off. 
[00:22:30]  Freeze.  Not quite that.  No.  No.  There's no flashbulbs going off.  But we got our.  And then you whisper to some publicist, but I'm Jim Norton.  And she goes, yeah, they know.  Yeah.  They keep going.  How long do you stand there waiting for someone else to take your picture?  I actually, I waited when I was in Good Luck Chuck.  I waited for every famous person to go in, so I'd be the last person on the red carpet.  Yeah.  And I had somebody that was going to tell people, oh, this is Robert Kelly from, he was in the  movies, Friends with Dane, he was in Torgasm, to come with me. 
[00:23:00]  And I got on the red carpet, nobody was there.  Of course not.  And they all kind of looked, they were all leaning.  And then they saw me, and like one guy kind of stood up and leaned it on like his left ass  cheek.  And then someone said, this is Bob Kelly, he's in the movie.  You heard one, and then I heard, excuse me, sir.  And I went, yeah, get out of the way.  Eddie Murphy just showed up.  They probably thought you were the guy there to roll it up. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  So you're on the red carpet with Robert Kelly.  And Roland and Roland's buddy.  And Roland.  Sure.  So we go in, we go upstairs.  We're very early.  But again, I wanted to get up and get our seats.  They're assigned seats, which is perfect.  And we get up in the thing, and you know, there's nothing to do for a little while.  So you're just kind of hanging out there.  And everyone acts like they're not looking for celebrities in the lobby.  But we're all looking for celebrities in the lobby.  That's all we're doing.  Meaning the celebrities themselves are all looking for celebrities.  Well, there were no celebrities at this point. 
[00:24:00]  This was an invited guest thing.  Okay.  So we finally saw Chevy Chase.  And then, like, later, Ricky Gervais came in, and we talked to him for a while, and that  was fine.  And then they started shooing everybody into the theater, because I guess the whole cast  was going to come up.  So they go, shoo, shoo.  That would have been less humiliating.  Guys, you got to go in.  And so we had to go in, because I guess that, like, when De Niro and Pacino come up.  So they sent us. 
[00:24:30]  It's a movie about being righteous.  Being righteous.  Of course he did that.  Killing.  And they did give us good seats, so I will say that.  We were three seats away from 50 Cent, right behind Donnie Wahlberg.  We were right in front of Erwin Winkler.  I mean, we had good seats.  They didn't screw us out of this.  We had really good seats.  And then the director, who's, like, got the beard and the baseball hat with the suit,  which was awful, goes up and opens the show.  And he goes, we're doing New York's finest. 
[00:25:00]  Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.  And we look, and they're sitting in the back.  They're each in an aisle seat.  They're, like, on the same row, five rows from the back, each in an aisle at the end.  And I don't even see Pacino.  I just try to see the silhouette of his wig.  It was awful.  It was like Emilio Estevez's wig from Men at Work.  And De Niro, I stared at De Niro a little bit, because he was, like, 15 rows behind us.  A little?  A little.  Yeah, like, what's De Niro?  He's sitting there watching a movie.  E.T. looking at Reese's Pieces. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  And the movie started, and from the opening song, I was like, oh, my God, we're in trouble.  From the opening song?  Wow.  I just said, this is going to be bad.  Well, that's pretty early on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This is an exclusive, by the way.  Not many people have seen Righteous Kill, and there's a lot of, there's a big buzz on this movie. 
[00:26:00]  Not many people are going to see it.  Really?  I'll tell you what the buzz is.  It's the sound of snoring.  We're five pages into the paparazzi pictures, by the way.  The paparazzo.  Yeah.  Not even a hint that you guys were there yet.  Well, that's not all from last night.  None of those are from last night.  They're all from last night.  They were all from last night, yeah.  You might catch it.  All right, try another page, because that one is not successful.  Anyway, so from the opening song there, what was the opening song?  I don't know.  I should have been Taps. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  We went through it very, very early, too, on the red carpet.  It was De Niro.  I'm not going to give the whole movie away, but they play cops, which is cool to see Pacino  playing a cop.  Again!  He's a cop.  It was good, though.  And Brian Denny, he's kind of the tough sergeant.  Yeah.  And De Niro is just very angry.  Pacino is very kind of good.  Was he subdued?  He was good, man.  Yeah?  He was old school Al, kind of. 
[00:27:00]  He didn't yell.  Okay.  Maybe he's been listening to criticism.  Yeah.  Still has that three-quarter length leather he's been wearing for the last 25 years.  Oh, God.  All of his movies.  I want to wear the leather.  The three-quarter length.  I don't care what Wardrobe thinks.  This is mine.  Buy the leather.  Don't wear it.  Buy the wig.  Definitely wear it.  Wear the wig.  Where's my lifts?  Where's my Hot Topic wig? 
[00:27:30]  My lifts.  Dude, his shoes.  I noticed in one scene Pacino's lifts in his shoes.  They were like little space men's shoes.  Yeah, I swear to God.  Space men's shoes.  Oh, look.  Little space fella's shoes.  It was...  He looks like the lead singer to an independent band shoes.  Just like a four-inch heel.  It was so...  De Niro was really not good.  He wasn't good.  He yelled a lot.  It was a cop serial killer. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, but Jimmy actually leaned into me probably ten minutes into the movie.  He goes...  And he told me the whole movie.  He just ruined the whole movie for me.  He goes, see that book?  I go, yeah.  He goes...  I knew what was happening.  I don't want to give away, but I knew what was happening.  He told me right at the beginning.  It was so obvious.  He was on the money.  He wasn't even kind of right.  He was right on the money.  I was so irritated.  And it was just...  The dialogue was awful. 
[00:28:30]  Was it just a regular pat cop movie kind of...  You felt nothing for them.  Really?  Nothing for their relationship at all.  Nothing.  The girl who was good, Carla something, that bitch was sexy.  She was great.  50 Cent.  You know, he acted good, considering that he used to deal drugs and was shot once.  I mean, he was okay.  But I mean, wow.  The only thing good there, really just good, was his gassers through the whole movie. 
[00:29:00]  You were gassing at the premiere?  I can't express to you how many farts eked out.  The whole movie.  And I almost...  It's like, you know, on my stomach.  I felt like...  Like, I had to put my head in the seat next to me.  Like, literally tried to get my head into the whole seat next to me.  Oh, man.  I dropped a bunch of gassers.  I didn't think he could smell them.  Like, I guess Bob's not getting any.  But I know that the chicks behind us must have been smelling them.  And stupid Erwin Winkler got a few nosefuls. 
[00:29:30]  You were crop dusting.  I was...  You were effing crop dusting the place.  It was...  But you guys haven't really explained why the movie is so bad.  Predictable.  I've saw...  Yes.  I've saw Law & Order episodes better than this movie.  Okay.  Well, now you're talking.  Now at least you're explaining.  It was probably...  Seriously.  It was like a Law & Order episode.  Just an hour and a half long.  That's what it was.  That's how...  Was the crowd...  Plot stunk.  Politely, like, getting into it? 
[00:30:00]  The crowd didn't like it.  Because when the movie ended...  Normally, because it's an industry crowd, the people who are there who are involved with  the production, they sit through the entire end of it and they applaud as the names pop  up at the premiere because they all know each other.  This one, literally, it ended horribly, by the way.  Just awful, banal dialogue.  Oh.  It meant nothing to me.  I felt nothing.  It was the worst ending line of any movie ever.  Well, let's just say this.  There was a death in the movie. 
[00:30:30]  You know, somebody died.  Mm-hmm.  And their death line...  Oh, no.  ...was terrible.  It was awful.  Oh, God.  I felt nothing watching this person die.  And the line...  I'll say the line because nobody knows who it was.  The line was, uh, continued success.  Well, that's something you write in a book.  Of course it is.  You saw it in the other actor's eyes?  Like, what did you just say?  Did you just improv that? 
[00:31:00]  Continued success.  It was awful.  It was so...  There was one line in there where Pacino was talking about De Niro because De Niro was  like the loose cannon.  Of course.  And he goes, I know sometimes it comes off like a pit bull on crack.  No, they didn't do the something on something joke.  Yeah.  No.  Should have been the douche on chills.  I could not believe it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And, uh, so afterwards we were outside looking at celebrities and I'm in the bathroom and 
[00:31:30]  I won't forgive myself for this probably ever.  And I'm tinkling.  And Roland comes over and he's at the urinal next to me.  None of us liked the movie.  Um, you know.  I want to hear Roland's take on it.  That'll be fun.  Richard Belzer came out and we said hello.  And he's like, uh, he's like, what'd you think?  And I grabbed his arm and I just leaned in and I said, it was awful.  It was awful.  You couldn't have liked it.  I was just trashing the movie.  It was terrible.  And what did he say?  He goes, shh.  Yeah, of course he did.  He was kidding.  He was being funny.  Oh, okay. 
[00:32:00]  Um, so I'm in the bathroom, Roland's standing next to me and, uh, Roland's like, whoa,  that was suspenseful.  Really sarcastic.  What an ass he is.  And I'm like, oh, Roland, well, you know, hey, Roland, uh, because to Roland's right in  a suit and a hat was the director.  Oh.  And he was about to lay in and trash the movie.  Oh, you should have let Roland do it.  I will never.  You should have let him do that.  Forgive myself.  That opportunity will never come about again.  That is. 
[00:32:30]  He would have been on the unemployment line, Jimmy.  It wasn't something that was conscious.  It was just, and it wasn't, oh, the director, because I could care less.  But he's got to know the movie sucks.  He's not stupid.  He has to.  Oh, by the way, De Niro Pacino left 10 minutes in the movie.  10 minutes later, they were gone.  Because I went up to take a leak at one point during the movie.  They were gone.  Yeah, those guys always just sneak out.  That's why they're in the back.  Yep.  They want to be there for the, hey, here they are.  And everyone assumes, oh, wow, I'm watching the movie with these guys.  So I'm not leaving because they're here.  And they sneak right out as the opening credits are rolling.  I was so mad that I stopped him from trashing the movie with the director there. 
[00:33:00]  It was just an instinct because all the guys there shut up.  Right.  But I won't forgive myself for that because he's like, oh, yeah.  He was really cocked up on the bat.  So this is going to be a bomb, huh?  I don't know.  Isn't this the time of year where all the bad movies come out?  Yeah.  The ones that they really like, they put out in the summer and then a little later in  the season, right?  After Halloween, we'll start getting good stuff leading up to the holidays.  And this guy, Avnet, John Avnet, he gave us great movies like Inspector Gadget and that 
[00:33:30]  stupid starter wife thing with Debra Messing.  Oh, he's awful.  So he hasn't done anything really huge.  I think that they think putting these guys together is enough.  Yeah, just having them on the screen.  It means nothing.  Nobody cares.  No, maybe years ago.  There was too many guns pulled.  The anger between John Leguizamo was in it and the cops all angry at each other.  Oh, it just was creepy and dumb.  It didn't make sense.  It didn't make sense, first of all, because it's like the cops would go. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, God.  You know, I don't know why you guys, no one's going to see this movie.  Stop being careful.  What's going on with this movie?  Be careful.  I said it stunk.  No, I know, but you're not really saying much in case people want to see this movie.  I won't give away the end.  They're gone already.  There was a serial killer, a cop serial killer, killing criminals who had gotten off on technicalities  and stuff like that.  Oh, God.  How many times has that been done?  Isn't that like the Star Chamber?  Dude, that's been done a thousand times. 
[00:34:30]  Star Chamber did that very well, where they went after people that got off for crazy crimes.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Oh, this is the same director that did 88 Minutes with Pacino.  Oh.  Oh, he is.  That was a good one, too.  He is bad.  Wow.  He should direct himself onto the business end of a shotgun.  Holy mackerel.  So what?  The cops are going after...  The serial killer, and it could be one of the cops who's the serial killer.  But there's a twist with each, both cops. 
[00:35:00]  De Niro is the blue collar, you know, cop, old school cop.  By the book guy.  No, no, the angry guy.  Oh, the angry guy.  Al Pacino is this prodigy somehow.  Okay.  But they let you know that he's extra smart because he plays chess.  Okay.  That's a way to convey...  That's always how you convey intelligence.  A white guy playing a black guy in a park in chess, and he wins.  What they did with that, that was one of those things that they think is a character depth thing. 
[00:35:30]  Like, we'll really let you know this guy.  Yeah, he plays chess.  And he mentioned playing Bobby Fischer.  Shut up.  Or watched him play.  Did you?  Oh, no.  Did you watch him write dialogue?  Because he played six people at one time.  Yeah, watched him play six people at one.  So what?  Who cares that you watch that?  It doesn't help the movie.  It actually, it doesn't hurt it either.  It couldn't hurt it.  The only thing that could have hurt it was an extra minute. 
[00:36:00]  It helped it.  One minute less.  It was terribly written.  Whoever wrote that should have their computer taken away for a year's punishment.  And a pit bull on crack.  Hee hee.  Ooh.  Any more banner lines you can remember?  Oh, Mike.  There was some moment of passion, and then they have to get in the line, the righteous line.  Hey, you're a righteous man.  They had to throw the word righteous.  Righteous.  That's when you know the movie stinks.  Right at the end of the movie, when it's that big emotional scene, they always have to 
[00:36:30]  throw the movie in there, the name of the movie.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a righteous man.  Oh, God.  You knew it was coming.  Was there a love interest of any kind?  Any woman angle?  Yeah, but she was good.  She was actually really sexy.  But I hate that, because that's another pat thing that they have to put in every movie,  these stupid generic cop movies.  There's got to be the girl love story angle. 
[00:37:00]  But this girl liked taking a beating.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she was kinky.  She liked taking it.  Okay, no wonder they liked her.  Exactly.  She was actually mad at De Niro, because he didn't slap her and beat her and disrespect  her enough.  He came home and grabbed her by the mouth and said, stop.  We got Colin Quinn on the line.  Colin!  Hi, guys.  How are you, Colin?  Colin's up early today.  Yeah, well, I want to make, I have an idea for a serial killer movie starring Roland and 
[00:37:30]  Big A.  It was a Lulu.  Are you hearing the review of Righteous Kill there?  I did hear it from that phony, but you know what?  Yeah.  He's right about that movie, of course.  But he's wrong that he even went to that premiere.  A real intuitive artist like myself.  Wouldn't be invited.  Yeah.  Colin makes a great point.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  Because when Jimmy said that you were going to this premiere, I'm like, my eyebrows raised. 
[00:38:00]  Literally, I was suspicious.  I'm like, we're never invited to the good premiere.  Right.  Ever.  Yeah.  We're always invited to some lame-ass movie that might have a star in it.  And you get excited and realize, oh, now I know why I'm here.  No one else wanted to come here.  But it's also because Norton is like what the black people used to call a striver in  their community.  What?  He's a striver.  First of all, don't say what.  Like, you're going to somehow stop me.  Don't snap on me.  I don't even know if I'm not on your side yet. 
[00:38:30]  He's still deciding.  Yeah.  I mean, Colin just snaps on everybody and just leaves wreckage in the past.  I, no, Kyle, I wanted to go because it was Pacino and De Niro, and there was no shot to  get a picture.  But if I could have got a picture, of course, I was going to go.  First of all, Bob, what about this?  Bob, what about this?  What about assume you're on my side because I'm trashing the third guy the way we've all  worked for many years?  I was on your side.  I said, but don't say you don't know if you are.  All right.  I didn't know if your point was valid.  Yeah.  The point is this.  The striver thing is, like when the blacks that move up to nice houses, they move up 
[00:39:00]  to strivers row.  Norton thinks he's going to be like a mover and shaker.  I think it premieres and going, Bob, I thought that one scene was rather intense.  He thinks he's in the game and he's not, and I'm just getting frustrated.  It's probably what woke me up this morning.  No, I just, I wanted to see if I could get a picture and there was no chance for it.  No chance.  No, it was fine.  No chance.  No chance. 
[00:39:30]  He should not try, though.  I think that's the only reason you went, just to get a picture.  And they went to the after party and...  And of course they weren't there.  They had come and gone in 10 minutes.  They'd probably get paid to be there real quick.  Yeah.  But the security was all New York cops and they all listened to the show.  Yeah.  So they let us into all the areas we didn't belong in.  We were on the stage that we shouldn't be on, like that section where all the stars were.  50 were, that's what De Niro was.  We actually got on that little stage and it's all white Jewish guys, really rich with hot chicks. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And help finance the movie or something.  Yeah.  A couple, a couple of regular PA chicks that were, you know, probably did something on the movie and publicists.  And then the stars and little, I call him tippy-toe Norton because that's all he does is try to tippy-toe over people's shoulders to see who's famous is here.  Anytime you saw a light, you just see little Jim's bald head pop up behind somebody's shoulder.  Who's that?  And he will stare right into somebody's face.  He doesn't care how uncomfortable. 
[00:40:30]  He doesn't blink.  He doesn't blink.  He just, let me tell you something about Jim.  He's part ninja when it comes to getting his photos because I'm on the stage.  It's packed.  There's no way to just get through this crowd.  All of a sudden, he's just on the other side right by 50.  Like he uses his superpowers to like eliminate all the bones in his body and just become water and just mushes by people.  Mushes by people and then reanimates.  He's like, come over here.  And I'm like, I can't.  I'm human.  I can't get to that part of the stage. 
[00:41:00]  Bobby, you know what's weird about the whole thing?  We've known Jimmy for eight years.  Jimmy's now, you're famous, Jimmy.  But your attitude has not changed.  He's still that little boy from Jersey trying to get his picture with somebody famous.  I'm just sweet.  You've got an HBO show starting in early October.  You've done the Bob's.  I mean, your credits are pretty amazing at this point.  Oh, Colin?  Yes, Colin.  That's what he prides himself on.  What do you mean?  What's that?  Being a phony like Leno who goes, hey, I'm just a regular guy, not like these Hollywood stars.  I'm a Leno with two phonies, like a regular guy. 
[00:41:30]  The son of a bitch has $5 million in the bank, probably.  I certainly don't.  And I don't like the way, talk about phony, I don't like the way Colin's saying he wouldn't  have went to the De Niro Pacino premiere.  I've been invited to everything you idiot my whole life.  I've come to go again.  No, you didn't.  You were alone eating scones with tea.  Yeah, you know, Colin, Jimmy makes a good point.  No, he makes a good point.  You're like a shut-in at this point.  Jimmy's going somewhere in the middle is where you both should be. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, you weren't going to go unless they had coconut bars.  Yeah.  Don't act like you're selective.  You're not selective.  Exactly.  Oh, God.  That's it.  No, sorry.  I was darning my stockings.  I didn't hear you guys.  What did that look like?  Unchewed rib meat?  I don't know if I wanted to get a little greedy at that last one.  A little bit.  Colin?  We had fun, but it was not a good one. 
[00:42:30]  You really do turn into another.  Like, there's Jim Norton, the comedian, very confident.  Yeah, hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Does his thing.  Almost elitist sometimes, the way he talks and the way he, you know.  Marmy, you might say.  Yeah, that too.  And then when he turns into a little fanboy, Tippy Toe Norton, he turns it, his eyes get  wider, his skin goes paler.  He actually, it's just a, he turns into a little guy and then you just see him staring  at a corner of a room.  Like, there was an exit sign. 
[00:43:00]  He's like, and he keeps repeating.  He gets obsessive.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen this.  But he's not talking to you.  He's talking to his own brain.  Like, he's going, yeah, he's probably going to come in through there.  I mean.  Got to come in through that door.  Did he have his camera out the window?  He's got to go to Kmart.  Got to go to Kmart.  Did he have the camera out the whole time?  He had it in his pocket.  He goes.  Was he checking it every two minutes?  Yeah, he keeps grabbing it.  He keeps checking like, okay, all right, all right, it's set.  Oh, wait, wait.  Okay, it's set.  Bob, I mean, if he's going to come through, that's where they come through.  That's a lot.  I've assessed the whole room.  I mean, I went through every door. 
[00:43:30]  That's the exit.  The exit is going to come through there.  So I'll just stay here.  A couple more minutes, we'll just stay here.  We'll be here for a couple.  Just a couple more minutes, we'll stay here and, you know, see what happens.  Hey, you know, we'll probably, and he's all, he's really negative, too.  It's probably not going to happen, but you never know.  You never, you got to, you got to try.  You got to try.  You're not talking to me.  You're talking to yourself.  But I was being realistic, though.  I sensed it wasn't, because I didn't think they were going to go to that awful party.  And it turns out they came and went.  And then I think Bobby might have said maybe they get paid to be there.  I'm like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.  They probably get, you know, 50 grand to show up for 20 minutes.  Right.  That's exactly what happens.  They pay the stars of them. 
[00:44:00]  Ah, I got to give up this phone.  God damn heck.  Let me.  Well, the stars of the movie, they don't have a percentage of the movie, and they go  to it because it's publicity.  No, the party.  They give, right.  That's what I'm saying.  They, I was being sarcastic, that's what.  They don't pay them, and then part of their percentage of what they make in the movie might  do well if they go to the party.  No, they do.  You see, you don't.  They get them off with 50 grand.  Hey, here's 50.  Just show up at the party.  No, no, no.  The club.  The club.  They go to the party and leave.  This is why Colin doesn't know.  No one's ever paid you to be anywhere.  They've actually paid you to leave early. 
[00:44:30]  Crocodile Dundee didn't have an after party.  Of course it didn't have an after party.  Oh, why would you bring that up?  No, Carl.  That was mean.  Sometimes the club will give these guys money to show up.  Turn on me, Opie.  Because the club wants them there.  What did you say that was mean, Opie?  He just made a Crocodile Dundee reference.  I didn't think that was called for.  That is a bit.  And it's Crocodile Dundee 2.  2, right, of course.  Get it right.  That's what I said.  And I tried to help make it better.  I rewrote it, but they don't know what's good for them.  Colin, why don't you get your ass in here?  You're up early.  You got the boys in here.  You got to give them a little trashing, too. 
[00:45:00]  What are you doing right now?  That's, you know, I'm just trying to rewrite some stuff, actually.  I just got up.  I got up like 20 minutes ago.  I figured I'd give you guys a nice call, throw some zingers around the room, and get back to work.  Why don't you put some lotion on your eczema ankles?  Yeah, try to put some body fat on those legs, too.  Yeah, I'll try, guys.  Good one.  Oh, that's good.  All right, Colin.  We have to take care.  They do pay the money, either.  I was the one that didn't laugh just now.  That was the entire place. 
[00:45:30]  I was the one that didn't laugh just now.  He was too hit with a couple of zingers, and the whole place quieted down.  It's not my fault.  Yeah, there you go.  They do pay people to go to parties, too.  All right, Colin's coming in next week.  They don't pay them to go to parties.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  They're so stupid.  They do.  They do.  Who pays them, though?  The club, because the club.  Oh, the club.  The club would want.  Shut up, Kyle.  The club would want De Niro and Pacino in that club.  Of course.  What, are they going to go to a loud,  doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom for 10 minutes?  Yeah.  Why would they go to that?  That's good, Billy Jay.  I like your bit. 
[00:46:00]  But why would they go listen to that loud music?  Yeah, then the club has bragging rights.  Yeah, well, actually.  De Niro was in our place.  Me and Dane and Gary got free Sony VAIO computers  to go to a party in Vegas.  Let me translate.  Dane and two friends.  Right.  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  Dane was like, we didn't make the flight,  and we weren't going to make the party.  And I was like, Dane,  you should find out about those computers.  I mean, we should still get them.  We tried to go.  He was like, yeah, don't worry about it. 
[00:46:30]  And meanwhile, they gave Dane three computers,  and he gave you one.  I didn't let the computer.  That's how that worked.  You know, he didn't care.  He didn't want a computer.  He can buy whatever he wants.  I was like, dude, what about those computers?  I bugged him for like two weeks about the computers.  I'm sure you did.  Until I got a computer in the mail,  and then I resold it.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  Colin, come on in next week.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Get in here.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, get sleazy.  Colin Quinn up early.  All right, Robert Kelly in studio.  We got to take a quick break here. 
[00:47:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I laughed, I cried,  I shat in the mouth of an invalid.  Ew, that's disgusting.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's even worse than this.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Robert Kelly in studio today.  Hey, Robert, are you in mourning?  Your boy went down.  You're basically in love with Tom Brady,  and he's out.  I feel bad for him,  and we broke up last year,  like I told you before,  so I haven't been in contact, 
[00:47:30]  and I'm really not involved,  but you know what?  Maybe you get what you deserve.  Oh, what are you talking about?  You know what?  You know what?  Maybe you're hungry.  You saw Rocky.  Rocky III.  Remember Rocky III?  Show them all, sir.  He had a robot, right?  He was in top, tip-top shape.  He had a robot.  Right, and then what happened?  He kind of got complacent.  Yeah.  When the hungry Clubber Lang  is working out in the sweaty, 
[00:48:00]  stinky basement,  Rocky was making a mockery  of his workout,  and he got his ass handed to him  by Clubber Lang.  And that's what happened at Tom.  And Mickey did, too,  and Adrian was going to  actually go over to his house.  She was going to take up his offer.  Hey, woman.  Let's see what a real man is like.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Once you come over to my place,  I'll see what a real man's like.  Oh, that made everybody mad.  Oh, yeah, because...  It still makes me mad.  She wanted to go so bad. 
[00:48:30]  Of course she did.  And just have a big...  Did you see her face in the movie, too?  She didn't respond like she got shy?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Like Sam gets when I look at him in the eye.  Your obsession with Sam is creepy.  So you're telling Boston  it's Tom Brady's fault that he's out  for at least six to nine months?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, he's hanging out  with a Brazilian model.  You know, back when he was hungry,  you know, he was dating  a regular fat chick from college.  He was hungry.  And he was probably working out extra, 
[00:49:00]  probably making sure he stretched out.  Everything was legit.  Right.  He didn't do preseason this year.  He was out with an anchor.  He's been...  And this is a weird fact.  He's been on the injured list  his whole career.  They finally took him off.  Really?  Every week he's been on it.  Even for little things.  He's been on it.  Yes.  Every week he's been on it.  They finally said,  Hey, you know what?  Just take me off that.  They took him off it.  Boom.  Now he's injured.  Torn ACL.  And he was on the ground going, 
[00:49:30]  Ah!  You know how that feels, don't you?  Oh.  Ah!  You hear it.  He didn't have anybody holding his hand,  we noticed.  No.  Nobody.  Nobody was holding his hand.  And his injury was a little worse than yours.  And he walked out.  How do you know it was worse than mine?  Because it's in the paper today.  He had two ligaments.  I had two, too.  He had the...  That's four.  I had two, too.  The medium and the...  I had two, too.  I was like a pit bull on crack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He tore the medium in it.  You think you're going to speak in my ear?  It's going to go through my mouth? 
[00:50:00]  Into the microphone?  Just grab the mic, bro.  Ah, wow.  It's a technique.  It's a background technique.  He's got two ligaments that are torn.  And it'll be six to eight weeks before they can work on it,  because the swelling is still mad.  They've got to wait for the swelling to go down.  He's not going to get operated on for at least a month.  Yeah.  That's what I got.  AMC...  MCL?  MCL.  That's what he has.  And I have ACL.  That's mine, too.  Oh, so it's pretty much the same injury.  I heard two rips.  That was it.  He still wasn't holding anyone's hand out there.  I did a show two nights later.  Well, he walked off the field.  Did you walk off your field? 
[00:50:30]  I...  No.  Yeah.  He walked off.  He walked off.  Bob didn't have equipment on, though, to hold him up,  and he didn't have drugs to take.  They probably gave him drugs.  They probably shot him up immediately with something.  Yeah.  They actually...  My knee was swollen, and they actually had my ankle, too,  and then my manager just had to tell him when he came out,  he was like, oh, his ankle's fine.  He goes, no, he just has fat ankles.  I just...  They thought my ankles were swollen.  They thought you broke an ankle?  They thought I broke my ankles because my ankles were swollen.  They were like, good news is his ankles are fine.  He's like, but there's nothing wrong with his ankles. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, we thought they were swollen.  We thought he hurt his ankles, too.  That's not good.  No, it's not good.  We actually x-rayed his face, his chin, his elbows, his boobs.  Yeah.  I almost said a T-word.  Oh, don't be fresh.  I'm learning, guys, though.  Right away, he got fresh.  So you're not following the Patriots?  No, no.  I told you, last year I was in a...  What about this Matt Castle?  Right, Castle?  Yeah, he's fantastic.  He hasn't started a game since high school.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  That's going to work out pretty good this weekend.  Wow.  Really?  Since high school he hasn't started?  And he's like 25, 26, too.  He's not...  He's no rookie.  Matt Castle's going to get invaded.  Wow.  Ugh.  Matt Castle is going to get run over by a pit bull.  Yeah.  I'm crack.  Oh.  Wow, 1988.  I wish you well in all your endeavors.  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Continued success.  Luck.  Blink eyes.  Blink eyes. 
[00:52:00]  Go dead.  God, no one fell for anything.  Oh, really?  Oh.  All right.  I swear to God, you saw it in De Niro's face.  They captured him looking like, what's he doing?  What is this?  What's this improv line?  This line stinks.  Who dies?  Al or Rob?  Does it always say?  Al, Al, Al dies.  I'm not going to...  No, you might have...  I'm just going to guess.  I didn't say it.  Righteous Kill blows.  You guys saw it.  It's obvious.  Well, the movie...  Who cares?  It's not like we're giving away anything from The Dark Knight.  The movie people were nice, so I don't want to say...  You should go see...  Yeah.  You should go see the movie.  Wait, Robert, does Al Pacino die? 
[00:52:30]  Huh?  What'd you say?  Does De Niro die?  No.  It's Al.  All right.  No, it's not Al.  Wait a minute.  Let me do it again.  Do it again.  Al Pacino die?  No, no, it doesn't.  From the description, the whole cast dies in the movie.  The whole audience wanted to.  Well, I left...  No, it's the movie.  I'll break your head.  De Niro, I'll break your head.  I'll get back.  Not now.  And then John Leguizamo's angry.  I'll get you.  Oh, he's a loose cannon. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Who dies?  Come on.  Jimmy, does Al Pacino die?  Oh, but I want to say this.  If you say who dies, I think all of us did a little bit.  Robert was really good.  I'm going to try you now.  Does Al Pacino die?  No.  Does Robert De Niro die?  No.  I'm tired.  I'm going to laugh.  All right.  It's Al Pacino.  And then he coughs.  I'm kidding.  It's not Al Pacino.  Jimmy's got some tells.  It's Al Pacino.  Al Pacino dies in the movie.  I don't have any tells. 
[00:53:30]  That's me again.  Did Al Pacino...  No.  All right.  Watch this, though.  Does Robert De Niro die?  No.  See?  My arms are up in the air.  So what?  It has to be Al.  Does Al Pacino die?  No.  So they kill off Al Pacino in this movie?  I don't remember.  It was...  I blocked the whole thing out like a bad episode in childhood.  You have to go see it just to see the end scene where they catch little Al's little baby feet. 
[00:54:00]  And he has...  It looks like he has painted wooded blocks on his feet.  Like, you know, Japanese shoes.  Yuck.  The big elevator shoes.  They're so bad.  I'm short.  Was he wearing Herman Munster shoes throughout the whole movie?  Make sure you frame out my feet.  And my head.  I'm a cop again.  I want to be framed in from my eyebrows to my chest.  I wear big elevator shoes because I'm not tall. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Reach for the top shelf, but don't get nothing.  Hey, can you...  Can you ring that doorbell for me, son?  Drive a car.  Put blocks on the pedals.  Go to the 15th floor.  Push that button.  He was good, though, because he was really...  He was like the old Pacino.  Like, De Niro really bugged me.  Yeah.  Isn't De Niro...  I don't know what he looked like in the movie, but does he look a little too old and fat to be the tough guy anymore?  It's not working anymore. 
[00:55:00]  Like, you watch Goodfellas.  You watch Casino.  Those things, yeah, you could see him as like a tough guy kind of thing, but wow.  Sorry.  He wears a gray sweatsuit and a lot of it, and his gut sticking out.  He said they should have played.  Like, they should play like two fathers.  Like, maybe Pacino's got a son who's a homosexual, and De Niro's got a son who's attending college, and they come to grips with something.  How about you guys do that?  How about you do something different? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I'm a cop again.  Jimmy, does Al die?  No.  What about De Niro?  I'm going to remake a fried green tomatoes.  That's what I want to see him do.  Bridges in Madison County.  Can I put my film in your refrigerator?  Look at the bridge, but don't cross.  Don't cross it.  Wow, this movie sounds like it's a doozy, huh?  50 cent?  Yeah.  Is it cent?  Fitty.  Fitty.  Fitty.  Just call him fitty. 
[00:56:00]  Fitty.  Actually, just call him f***.  Whoa.  Wow.  What's wrong with you?  I love how you still have to mouth it.  Of course I do.  The whole thing.  Mouth it, say it.  Do you know what was funny, though?  It's just a reflex at this point.  It's my whole drive home.  Because I've been on the radio shows where guys might do something like that, but they don't say it.  They just push the button.  And you are actually saying, you're pushing the button because you're going to say it.  Because I'm saying it.  Yeah, it's real.  You're not doing a gag.  He's turning off his mic.  Yes, of course. 
[00:56:30]  Just to make sure.  All right, listen.  All right.  Obviously, the movie blows, and obviously Al Pacino dies.  De Niro is very good, though.  But De Niro...  I'll break your head!  All right.  See you, Bob.  Let's move on to a couple other things here.  We got Obama on Letterman.  We got the sex book.  What do you want to do, Anthony?  Well...  We were mentioning the sex book story, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, we should probably do that.  It's a quickie.  It's...  Somebody came out with a book, 101 Places You Should Have Sex Before You Die. 
[00:57:00]  I love Anthony's decision-making.  Hey, Anthony, what should we do?  Yeah, that.  That.  Whatever.  The second one.  The second one of the things you said.  One of the places you're supposed...  You could have sex before you die is in a pew at a church.  No way.  They didn't write that.  That's outrageous.  So, of course...  You should be fired.  So, of course, they're tying us into this book and the story.  How did we get tied in?  Well, Warren.  What did we do?  The book is called 101 Places to Have Sex Before You Die.  With Dalmatians. 
[00:57:30]  It's a title, but not everyone is pleased with one of its suggestions.  The book encourages couples to sneak into church confessional booths and have sex.  Bill Donahue of the Catholic League isn't amused.  Really?  I thought he would be.  Oh, I'm amused now.  See, when O&A did something like that, I wasn't amused.  But now, I'm laughing my ass off.  Laughing my Catholic ass off.  Bill Donahue of the Catholic League isn't amused and doesn't hide his disgust.  When I thought about it, I said, who wouldn't want to have sex in a confessional?  The very same people who wouldn't mind having sex in a graveyard. 
[00:58:00]  And I don't mean, by the way, with each other.  Okay, he's angry.  And you know what?  He's not alone.  Wow, you've got to be kidding me.  Wow, you've got to be kidding me.  Ah, the person on the street.  Person on the street guy, yeah.  What's wrong with the places we had sex at?  They was good.  The bedroom.  Backseat of a car.  In a shopping cart in a milk aisle.  Behind a dumpster. 
[00:58:30]  They always bring up the graveyard.  Who cares if you have sex in a graveyard?  Just got to ply the girl with a little moo.  In a foyer before she gets into her apartment.  Yeah.  The book adds drawbacks, including splinters and excommunication.  It also is reminding some of the Opie and Anthony gag that got the team fired back in 2002.  The same people promoting this is owned by Viacom, which owns CBS, which is the same ones who had the thing with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  The pair put a couple having sex on the air in the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral while people prayed.  We only found one person who didn't find the idea totally offensive.  I never thought about it, and I think maybe it would be number 100 in having sex to be in the church.  What?  What are you trying to say, man?  She's babbling, trying to be outrageous.  What are you trying to say?  Can I just ask a question?  Were there people really praying when that happened? 
[00:59:30]  Were there people on their knees praying, doing the rosary while you guys...  No one knows, because they did it in the vestibule, where there was a huge, giant, archaic, friggin' 1600 wooden door.  One of those...  It was closed.  No one could see.  All right.  I just...  That annoys me that he added the word where people were praying.  Well, they said pew-rocking sex, like it was happening in the church.  It was a catastrophe, but there was no, you know, what were we going to do? 
[01:00:00]  Hey, it wasn't really in the church.  And the book is put out by, I think, Simon & Schuster, which is owned by Viacom, which...  Which is owned this, which used to own that.  Right.  That's how it's kind of linked.  It's like, Bill, everyone owns everything at some point.  Like the big guy upstairs is paying attention to the, you know...  God?  ...how all this is linked.  Well, pretty much.  Pretty much.  So we're all over the news today, so they're tying us into that fine book that's... 
[01:00:30]  Is the book out?  Stephen Basho is saying, no, it was P.U. rocking sex, because they were doing the two-point  conversion.  P.U. rocking sex.  Yeah, that wasn't a...  Two-point conversion.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, it was the two-point conversion.  I've never heard that slang.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Hey, you know who I saw last night briefly, too?  Who?  Pacino.  De Niro.  And the Pacino I saw, I just saw the wispy little wig hairs bobbing out.  I'm like, who is that little child?  Oh.  Big block feet. 
[01:01:00]  Looked like Otto and George.  It was Herman Munster's shoes.  They look like a puppet.  Hey.  Grandpa, get me some shoes.  Thank you, Herman Munster.  DMK assassination.  Frank Whaley.  Really?  You know Frank, right?  No.  Not at all.  Who is he?  What are you doing?  I thought you missed.  Who is he?  Say one again.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was in...  Wow.  He was shot by Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction.  Sure. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he was also...  You know who saw him?  And he was in...  Brett, right?  I don't remember the name of him.  What's his name?  Swimming with sharks.  Check out the big name on Brett.  The big brain.  He was in that.  What?  Yes.  Brad.  Brad, was it?  Brad.  Brad, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or Brad.  Oh, that's it?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't do nothing to be seen.  He's black.  What else?  What?  I love that scene.  With his suit and his dumb hat.  Did you get a picture with... 
[01:02:00]  What's his name?  No.  Why?  You got a picture with him?  Who?  Oh, you didn't.  You just went over and...  With the guy from Pulp Fiction.  We went over there...  Nah, I didn't care.  What?  That guy's in a huge pivotal scene in a giant movie.  I know, and he's in Swimming with Sharks, which I liked a lot more.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  But I didn't care.  Well, you're crazy with your pictures.  You're crazy with your pictures.  You don't know what to take or what not to.  Well, you know Pacino and De Niro, it's hard to...  Anything but them just seems stupid.  You didn't want to blow a chance by someone coming over and saying, no pictures, no pictures. 
[01:02:30]  No, they wouldn't have there.  No one cared.  You gambled with him to hopefully get a De Niro or a Pacino picture, and you lost.  He wasn't in the celebrity section.  No!  No.  He was just in the...  Him and Ice-T.  Poor guy.  And a bunch of guys were on the floor.  You could just walk right up to him.  Oh, really?  Not that you'd walk right up to Ice-T and be like, hey...  What's he going to do?  I don't know.  He's such a gangster these days.  I'm sorry.  He doesn't get zero cred, as I say.  When 50 Cent...  Not all of us have a gun in each sock.  Well...  When 50 Cent stood up, when Erwin Winkler was behind us, and I'm not exactly sure what 
[01:03:00]  he does, Erwin Winkler.  He's a big producer.  I know Colin right now is going, that's why you're not in show business!  Erwin Winkler?  Yeah.  What does he do exactly, Stunt Brain?  Could you Google him?  He gave us the...  Hey, just talking to my ear again.  The Towering Inferno.  I thought that was Erwin Allen.  Oh, you...  Yes, you are correct.  Ah, Stunt Brain.  My bad.  I was the Stunt Brain for the Stunt Brain.  Oh, boy.  There is a...  How about a Google?  But he has two movies in production right now.  Maybe he was the producer for this.  Well, let me just put it this way.  50 walked in with guys four times the size of him. 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  Just walked in, blocked the whole aisle, and him and his entourage, and they took up the  whole aisle, then they sat down.  You couldn't get near him, okay?  This white, this old white guy behind us...  Oh, no, don't tell me he was wearing a hat.  No.  Just...  Malata!  No, he...  Whoever he was was powerful, because 50 got up, walked right out into the aisle, and came  over to him, and, like, with no bodyguards.  He was holding his hand.  Yeah.  Or went to shake his hand. 
[01:04:00]  And 50 was holding both his hands the way you would gently hold the hands of an old person  you're seeking solace or guidance from.  Yeah, it was weird.  It was such a gentle interaction.  Yeah, his whole demeanor changed.  And then he walked him up the aisle to see his wife.  It was a really weird...  Wow, that is odd.  That's pretty cool.  Really weird interaction.  It was like a juvenile that actually was a success story.  You know, he just won the Devereaux Luxe Award for being good for the last four years,  and the old man was presenting him with the award.  That was his attitude.  Hey, thank you very much. 
[01:04:30]  He went from gangster to a little, you know, success story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy was powerful.  It's an odd scene.  Then he went and met his wife.  His wife was someone.  He was like, yeah, let's go meet her.  He was following up the aisle.  Wow.  There you go, hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  All right, we're going to take a break here.  Hi, hello, Steve.  Nice clothes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, duh.  He produced the Rocky movies.  He did?  So, yeah, Earl Winkler.  All right.  And the right stuff. 
[01:05:00]  And the right stuff.  Wow.  He's done a lot of...  He's a big producer.  Right behind us smelling...  Why would I know him?  ...smelling Jimmy's Gassers the whole time.  The whole time.  I guarantee if his nose...  If he didn't just do a lot of coke in the 80s, he caught a whiff because they were putrid.  I was like, how is Bob not smelling these?  Oh, I was...  Let me tell you.  I was smelling them, but I was trying to lick the inside of my shirt and smell that.  It was just making me puke.  It looked like they had effects for the movie.  Like, fog was coming in. 
[01:05:30]  Like, it was awful.  Yeah, they were really good.  Fog was...  Fog is rolling in.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We have to take a break.  Right.  877-212-018.  We go to break with some primetime gossip with young Sam Roberts.  We're back.  And it's time for more primetime gossip.  Opie and Anthony radio show producer, Iraq DeSexbagel, recently showed up to work with an apparent hand and arm injury.  It was obvious that he might have had a broken hand.  Yeah.  And possibly a broken elbow, right? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Iraq immediately downplayed the injury in an obvious attempt to hide the truth.  The hand's not broken.  It'll be fine, too.  I see an ace bandage, though.  His condition had many people on the show concerned for Iraq's safety, a sentiment echoed by the people who checked him out at the emergency room.  She sits down next to me, and she looks at me, and she goes, is this a domestic abuse issue?  She goes, I have to ask you, is this a domestic abuse issue?  Is everything okay at home?  I said, everything's fine. 
[01:06:30]  Everything's fine, huh?  According to our sources, that may not be the case.  We hear Sexbagel catches beatings from his lovely fiancé on the regular, and his poor attempts to cover all of it up is doing nothing to convince anyone that he's not a victim.  When I signed in and they were taking my insurance information, I said I got hurt at work.  I kept saying I got hurt at work.  On a serious note, we here at PTG would like to reach out to E-Rock  and let him know that no one can help him unless he first helps himself. 
[01:07:00]  Remember, E-Rock, the bruises and the broken bones are not your fault.  But for God's sake, ease up on the sandwiches a little.  Good luck, Sex Bagel.  We'll catch you next time with more Primetime Gossip.  Opie and Anthony, thanks for checking us out today.  I'd go for a political roundup. 
[01:07:30]  Got Obama on Letterman.  Yeah, he was kind of explaining the lipstick comment.  You got Biden telling a senator to stand up that's in a wheelchair.  Also Biden saying that Hillary would be basically a better choice for the vice presidency.  As good of a choice or even a better choice than himself.  I don't know if Obama wants him walking around saying that.  With the wheelchair, did he know the guy was in a wheelchair and was just screaming at him because he thought he was lazy? 
[01:08:00]  Well, must have been in a crowd.  Couldn't quite see him, maybe.  Yeah, but he knows the guy very well.  It was a slip up.  This is how it went down.  The video is really good.  I was only joking.  The audio isn't bad.  Maybe we should link the video to onaradio.com.  Chuck Graham, state senator, is here.  Chuck, stand up.  Chuck, let him see you.  Oh.  Oh, God love you.  What am I talking about?  I tell you what.  You're making everybody else stand up, though, pal. 
[01:08:30]  Thank you very, very much.  I tell you what.  Stand up for Chuck.  Since he can't.  Thank you, pal.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Good to see you, buddy.  Oh, he just didn't know how to get out of that.  Wow.  Hey, wow.  You're making everybody else stand up.  Everybody stand up.  Click your heels.  Standing up is overrated.  Let's do other things he can't do.  Jumping jacks for everybody.  Okay.  Yeah, why don't you, everybody, have sex with somebody. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Woo.  Let's all sit to pee for this next month.  Yeah.  In solidarity.  Everybody, grab your right leg and forcefully cross it over your left leg, because you can't  do it casually anymore without the use of your hands.  Take those turnip roots you call legs and straighten them out.  Let's walk out on our fists.  Yeah.  Everybody chant with me.  Sitting is fun.  Sitting is fun.  Bedsores are good.  And then Obama. 
[01:09:30]  A lot of attention to Obama because of the pig.  The pig comment.  The lipstick comment.  Yeah.  You really think he was talking about Sarah Palin?  Yeah.  When he made the pig comment, I think absolutely it was.  He's actually calling her a pig.  It was.  And he doesn't think.  Thinly veiled and directed.  Don't you think that's going to hurt him in the end?  Because he was able to make an excuse for it that everyone's buying, that he was talking  about McCain.  Yeah.  She made a lipstick comment.  Then he makes one tying it to a pig. 
[01:10:00]  You just naturally make the connection.  Everyone else did.  And that's absolutely what he was doing.  But he actually explained it last night in a perfect way.  He goes, in reality, if I did make that and I was doing that, she would be the lipstick,  not the pig.  He's trying to make an excuse like that.  That's what he said on Letterman last night.  Yeah, because she's not a pig.  He said last night on Letterman.  Letterman should have went, right when he started, he should have went, we get it.  His excuse.  If he said that about Hillary.  Pull a jimmy on him. 
[01:10:30]  All right, we know.  If he said that about Hillary, then maybe you would think pig, but she's not a pig.  No one's saying this woman is a pig.  They're all thinking she's hot and looks like a librarian that could get a lot sexier  without the glasses.  Too close to her lipstick line.  He's saying in that statement, if you break it down, the policy would be the pig.  She would be the lipstick you're putting on the old policy.  Yeah, you're trying to just dolly up the same old crap.  Right, with this contract.  Yeah, if you rip it apart and tear it apart and look into it, yeah, that might be what you 
[01:11:00]  see.  But on the outside, he knew he could get away with the thinly veiled reference to calling  her a pig, which is what he did, and he got away with it.  What does he mean by calling her a pig?  Because she's not pig-like.  It doesn't matter.  She's not pig-like.  She's just some bitch.  She's a pig.  That's what he's saying.  I know he's easy.  That's what he's saying.  I love it.  He just threw that on him.  He just threw it on him.  She's a bitch.  That's what he said.  Call her the white devil bitch pig, whatever it is.  That's what he says.  The white devil bitch pig.  All right. 
[01:11:30]  Well, this is what he had to say on Letterman last night.  Have you ever actually put lipstick on a pig?  You know, the answer would be no.  But I think it might be fun to try.  Do you...  I know the reaction to that was, you are overreacting.  You stand by that?  Absolutely.  Yeah, look.  This is...  If you...  Stop applauding. 
[01:12:00]  This is sort of silly season in politics.  Not that there's a non-silly season in politics.  That's right.  It's all silly, is it?  It gets sillier.  And, you know, it's a common expression in at least Illinois.  I don't know about New York City.  I don't know where you put lipstick on here.  Obama called politics silly.  Oh, that's coming out.  Is this the man you want in the White House?  I'm sure that's coming out.  But he's right.  It gets silly.  Is the war silly?  Is the economy silly? 
[01:12:30]  Let's hear Barack talk about politics.  Well, I don't know what politics are.  It's silly.  Is this the man you want?  Approved by this friggin' guy that can't lift his arms up and has dandruff.  Approved by a pig in lipstick.  I got an example of what he means by silly.  This is what he's talking about.  Education Week says Obama hasn't made a significant mark on education.  That he's elusive on accountability.  A staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.  Obama's one accomplishment?  Legislation to teach comprehensive sex education to kindergartners. 
[01:13:00]  Learning about sex before learning to read Barack Obama.  Wrong on education.  Wrong for your family.  Right on sex.  I'm John McCain and I approve this message.  I approve this mudslinging.  That's an example of silliness though right there.  The music's silly.  The music's like kindergarten-y music.  The allegations are silly.  Obama doesn't want your kids to learn about sex before they learn how to read.  Now who is your daddy and how does he have sex with your mommy? 
[01:13:30]  I mean that's what he means by silly.  Silly.  I love it.  They call me Rubberneck.  And then Obama continued on Letterman.  Keep in mind that technically she, had I meant it this way, she would be the lipstick.  He called her lipstick?  Why?  I don't know.  You're way ahead of me.  The failed policies of John McCain would be the pig. 
[01:14:00]  Should have left it alone, Brock.  You kind of had it.  That's a common expression.  I'm explaining it.  He's pretty smooth on those talk shows though.  McCain just, ah, yeah.  Bob Kelly ruined another bit.  Why?  Why?  I was, I was, I said it before you.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, last night.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Sorry.  The, ah, so he's calling her a dog wiener.  What?  Ah.  Lipstick.  Yeah, we got it.  That's what everyone knows.  Lipstick is, you know, that's what they, the slang for a, a part of a dog. 
[01:14:30]  That's right.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  Mikey.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  God damn.  Uh, exactly one year ago today, uh, 9-11-07, John McCain used the exact same lipstick on  a pig reference when talking about Hillary Clinton's, uh.  She is a pig.  But she is a pig.  Hey, do we have that clip?  Stump Brain's nodding his head.  We got it.  We should have that clip then.  On YouTube.  Check it out.  McCain has used that phrase publicly several times, but the issue was not that. 
[01:15:00]  If you listen to the audience in Obama's speech, they got the exact reference he was trying  to make.  Really?  Because he paused after he said it, and they all went, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  But what, what, what, was it kind of a legitimate, he could get away with it because McCain has  used it many times?  Sure.  It's absolutely, Hillary's used it, McCain's used it.  So, we need that clip because then it brings, it makes a little, it makes this make a little  more sense.  I, I don't know pigs that use lipstick.  I mean, they're always eating duty and things of that nature.  Let's go to Jonathan and, maybe she's a pig that don't fly straight. 
[01:15:30]  I should kill my catcher.  He hasn't gotten a hit all season.  Oh, Scarface.  Yeah, that was it.  Say hello to my little wig.  Say hello to my little shoes.  He really is walking around on cartons of cigarettes.  Old building, old Lego feet.  Nice block feet, dumbbell. 
[01:16:00]  We're really blowing this lipstick thing because everyone's.  What?  Everyone.  Wow, the way you put that.  Jeepers creepers.  But everyone's saying that McCain has used the same thing.  We really need that clip.  Maybe it was just referring to the fact that McCain used the same, you know,  talking to my mouth.  Talking to my mouth?  McCain has used it.  It's not an uncommon phrase.  All right, let's just get the clip and then we'll.  They're pulling it right now.  All right, all right.  And then we'll have it for everybody in a minute.  Jonathan in Indiana.  Thank you, Stump Brain. 
[01:16:30]  Jonathan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, Indiana loves you.  I'm a military dude.  I just got back from Iraq and on September 11th, I want to take a shout out to  everybody in New York and everybody fighting overseas.  But that's not why I called.  I called, you know, this Obama thing.  And, you know, what he said, you know, yesterday about the pig thing, he was playing the fence,  man.  And he knew what he was doing, but he was strategic about it.  And but I think that the media has been so far in the tank for Obama that now that Palin's 
[01:17:00]  in the mix, everything's shifted to McCain because of Palin.  And she's hot, man.  She might be a pig, but she's hot and I do her, you know.  But I really think I really think Obama's on his heels now.  And I think the Democratic Party is flustered because of Palin.  That's just my take, dude.  I'm just a regular dude from Indiana.  Well, the obsession with Palin is unbelievable.  The paper, that's all they have in the paper.  She's nuts.  Palin this, palin that.  I'll bet.  She's nuts.  I'll bet a hundred bucks right now that McCain wins. 
[01:17:30]  She's really.  Yeah.  I got that with you, too.  I'll bet a hundred bucks.  She's nuts.  Every photo she has, her eyes have that thousand yard stare.  That psycho girl.  Just her eyes are wide open looking right through you.  She's a fruitcake.  I think she's going to blow it.  And McCain's wife freaks me out.  She looks like.  Why?  She's hot.  I thought she was hot.  For her age, she is hot.  She looks like the tranny in that movie. 
[01:18:00]  What's that movie?  Never a good start.  She looks like the tranny.  And now it doesn't even matter the movie.  What's the movie?  The Crying Game.  No.  The one that was just out.  Q&A with Nick Nolte.  Jimmy's home movie.  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  What's wrong with the tranny we got?  The one from the, like, she'd just be in the back rehearsing her speeches.  I was drinking mimosas on Manhattan Beach.  Was it on the HBO Real Sex?  No.  It was a movie.  I wish I, you know what?  Well then forget it. 
[01:18:30]  We gave you enough help.  You couldn't come through.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I'm Bob Kelly.  Yeah, I'll take the $100 bet for a goof.  What the hell?  Will ya?  All right.  We'll bet a hundred bucks on the election.  I'll take it too.  You want to do it too?  I think Palin's going to really mess up.  She's been smooth.  Do ya?  She's been real smooth lately.  You want some action on that one?  So far I should say, but I think eventually she's going to mess up bad.  She's been repeating the same speech she gave at the convention.  Yep.  They won't let her do an interview because she has nothing.  They won't let her be out there alone. 
[01:19:00]  She goes with McCain.  I'll go for an interviewer.  She goes with McCain and she gives the same stupid stump speech that she's been given since the convention.  Now they sent her back to Alaska and you know there's a team of people.  Dude, there's a team of people.  Before you do it.  I caught myself.  They won't let her do interviews.  Dude, they won't let her do interviews.  But yeah, something's going to come up with her.  They're either going to prep her really good or she's going to bomb on her debate. 
[01:19:30]  I think Obama's in trouble if she keeps being as smooth as she has been.  But she hasn't talked.  She did one great speech.  One great speech.  That's all we saw.  She hasn't been on any talk shows.  She hasn't done any interviews.  She hasn't given any speech that's just an impromptu thing of what she believes or what she thinks.  It's what they wrote for her and that's all she's been saying.  She is doing an ABC interview.  Yeah, we'll see what happens then.  I think that's tonight, right?  Oh, there's a great photo of her over a dead elk with its throat cut. 
[01:20:00]  That's why I have any gloves.  Come on.  The guns, the killing.  Did you want a piece of the action there?  Yeah, absolutely.  McCain wins, I give you $100.  Obama wins, you give me $100.  You can't lose.  Just don't forget the 21-point spread.  What's the VIG?  I'll bet $25.  Wow!  All right, so I'm in for $2.25.  Go $100.  $100. 
[01:20:30]  Now, you know what's going to suck?  Just giving you.  Giving me the money when McCain wins.  Giving you money while you just line your pool.  You probably get it changed into one so you can throw it in your pool.  I'll throw it and get paper cuts on my schween.  I know someone else said it, but it is kind of obvious.  She really looks like she won some kind of contest when she's on that stage with McCain.  Just happy to be there.  Like, oh my God.  Happy to be there.  They picked me.  Who cares?  It's a vice president.  When was the last time a vice president had to, like, step in?  When was the last time?  It's been a while. 
[01:21:00]  Was it Johnson?  That was Kennedy.  Yeah, it was Kennedy.  No, that wasn't really technically.  Spiro Agnew had to leave, so he jumped in.  And then Nixon resigned.  So it wasn't, technically that's kind of weird.  That's a long time ago.  Yeah.  And that is a long time ago.  Come on.  No one ever voted for Ford for anything.  And he became president.  No, he was a president.  He just kind of slipped right in there, didn't he?  Yeah, literally.  Spiro Agnew.  Couldn't he have slipped?  Oh, ho, ho.  Hey, Chevy Chase. 
[01:21:30]  We're squeaky from when we need her.  She took a pot shot out.  Hey, we got the McCain lipstick thing.  Who was Ford's vice president?  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Pete Best.  What?  What?  Because that's an odd thing, because how did they appoint that?  Oh, I know.  It was Frank Treadwell.  What?  I thought it was Ted Treadwell.  No.  I was vice president.  No.  No? 
[01:22:00]  How about it?  It was Rockefeller.  Wow, that's something.  Okay, Rockefeller.  It was Gary Rockefeller.  Yeah.  With three R's.  I did not know that.  Okay.  With three R's.  Let's tell our Nelson people are saying.  No, I don't think it was.  Let's do the John McCain thing here.  Yes, sir.  I noticed in your speech you avoided any comparison of your plan to Hillary Clinton's plan.  I'm curious, have you or your staff put a price tag on what you see coming out of her campaign for Hillary Cairn? 
[01:22:30]  No, but there's many things that concern me about it.  It's vaguely, not vaguely, but eerily reminiscent of what they tried back in 1993.  I think they put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig.  There you go.  Uh-huh.  I think Obama's taken.  They put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig.  There you go.  That's fine.  That was so talking about the policy.  And that's what Obama's doing.  No, it wasn't.  It really wasn't.  Obama's wasn't. 
[01:23:00]  That was, you could tell.  When he said that, he was talking about the policy.  When Obama said it, you could tell he wanted to link it to her being a pig.  Yeah, let him.  But maybe in political circles, it was obvious that Obama was just kind of making fun of McCain and when he did that.  I don't know.  You know.  We're just dummy radio show hosts.  I will say anything bad about Obama that I can't keep him from being elected. 
[01:23:30]  I understand that.  That's all I'm doing here.  That's my job here.  I understand that.  Is to push McCain and the Republican Party to victory.  The party's over for you if he wins.  What?  The party's over for you if Obama wins.  It certainly is.  Won't be able to afford a party anymore.  Yes, you will.  Bastards.  No, I won't.  It'll all go to social programs, commie, commie.  38 percent, right?  38 percent?  What about it?  Taxes, it's going to go up from 30 percent.  38?  I'd love to pay 38.  Jesus Christ, 38. 
[01:24:00]  38 is a bargain.  You pay almost 50.  You pay almost 50 percent?  I'm a partner with the United States government in business.  I'm in business with the government.  Here, you know what?  Hey, government, do the rest of the show.  I'm going home today.  Nice.  I'm a partner with them.  Yeah.  I would love it if a guy in a suit just came in and poofed me.  All right.  Hello, I'm from the Internal Revenue Service, and I'll be doing the show, Opie.  And he did great impressions.  He was fun.  He kicks ass.  I get fired.  All he did was suggest bits, and he was responsible. 
[01:24:30]  I'll be here at 4.30 to help.  He doesn't drink.  Not at all.  He refuses it.  He's a teetotaler.  Yeah.  He doesn't fornicate.  Daniel never go over his house.  Because he doesn't drink.  He invites me over his house.  Oh, God.  He really does suck.  I hate this guy.  Wears a suit to work.  He's a true gentleman.  Nice.  A friend to everyone.  Yes.  We love government guy when he comes in.  We'll hate government guy. 
[01:25:00]  One more phone call on the pig thing.  Billy in New York.  How are you?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up, Billy?  Well, McCain's advisor, Warren something or another, wrote a book named The Lipstick on  a Pig, and it explained how to use it in a political sense.  How to use a metaphor.  Fascinating.  Obama's off the hook.  Let's make it official.  Oh, the guy's last name that you were talking about, by the way, was Peace.  Excuse me?  Boo!  Boo! 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  That was a colossal bomb.  I'd press one of the buttons, but it would mean I'd have to open my eyes.  It was too long of a wait.  Was that your way to commemorate 9-11?  Oh, wow.  Oh, another tragedy right here in the studio.  Yeah, it didn't go well.  Ah, we all have them. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Well, they all make them.  Even the pros.  Hack your Mr. Faber-Sham.  Well, it's break time, everybody.  Break time.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Joining the program, Mark Maron.  He likes his politics.  Does he?  And he's going through hell with a divorce thing.  Isn't he done with that or something?  He's got years to go, my friend.  Oh, dude.  They're half.  It's so.  That's why I won't get married.  What's not?  Give half of my money that I'm going to make for my second show in Boston with the pre-sale 
[01:26:30]  starts in a couple hours today.  I don't want to give it.  Oh, wow.  You're doing two shows?  Yeah, the first one's sold out.  The second one is the November 15th at 7 o'clock, but it's not important.  No.  No, the issue.  Can I just say something, though?  I didn't even sell out my first show, October 24th, at the Wilbur Theater.  Oh.  This is 10 a.m.  Tickets go on sale for November 15th, my second show.  This morning, the pre-sale begins.  Wow.  Good for you, Jim.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:27:00]  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern, visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  God damn it!  Fuck this show.  Take this fucking show and forget it.  Forget fucking fucking fast.  Fantastic.  I'm tired.  It's early.  Yeah.  There's an obsession going on in this studio.  They just showed De Niro and Pacino.  I guess they're doing an interview on the Today Show.  And wow. 
[01:27:30]  It looked like De Niro was doing his De Niro impression.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, by the way, we got Marc Maron joining the show right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just had a comment on Jimmy's review of the movie.  Yeah.  It's so...  Oh, my God.  It popped too early for Bob.  Bob Kelly's ass is too early for that.  And Jimmy's smacking it.  What are you doing that on purpose?  Pull your pants up.  His whole ass is out.  He's bending over with his ass exposed.  I had a few grown hair.  Dude, it looks like you got a spider bite or something on there. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, what's on your dirty, zitty ass?  My wife, she waxed my butt.  But she didn't do a good job.  I actually licked my hand before I spanked it.  Yeah.  Why are you getting...  You got DNA.  You got Jimmy's DNA on your ass again.  Hold on.  Why are you getting your ass waxed?  Well, because I...  Because he's a girl.  I didn't have a lot of hair.  Isn't that clear?  But it was just that, like, curly, wispy hair.  Like that, you know, when your testosterone starts to change when you hit 40.  Look how much time you put into your face and head.  You're like a woman. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, but...  And now your ass, too?  Thank you.  Who's saying?  Yeah, you're pretty.  You're pretty.  That's actually a compliment.  That's a backwards compliment, Marc.  Who's saying your hairless ass, though?  Then you need it waxed.  Well, you know, I get weird.  I was going to...  I was actually going to Vegas, and...  So you need a clean ass?  This is the thing you don't do.  I went into the shower.  Just in case.  In case you lose it in Vegas, it'll be clean.  Mwah!  Pow!  I didn't take a shower for, like, a week and a half.  I didn't shave.  I was a mess. 
[01:29:00]  Yummy.  I smelled.  And then I'm going to Vegas for that thing with Dane at the Caesars Palace.  Who's this Dane person?  Another Dane mention.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Enough about Dane.  Wow.  There's a...  Is he sharing that huge mansion he just bought in Hollywood with you?  I do have a room there.  Yeah, that's why I had to clean his ass, because he walks around with just an apron on at the  mansion.  And then I went into the shower, and I trimmed everything.  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  And I walked out, and I go, honey, how's this look?  And what did Dane say?  She said. 
[01:29:30]  She said.  Good enough for a tourgasm, too.  You know what's weird about seeing De Niro and Pacino?  That's just what...  Yeah.  Those old method guys, you know what happens to them?  As they get older, they just become this weird collection of familiar tics that they  can't connect anymore.  You know what I mean?  They just...  All these things that used to be connected to emotions, and now just these weird kind of  tics that people are like, oh, that's the De Niro thing.  Yeah.  Pacino and stuff.  I was commenting before about that.  Jimmy said the movie's stinkeroo. 
[01:30:00]  And you could tell, because when do you see De Niro and Pacino sitting in a chair, waiting  for some schlep to interview them about a movie?  But just the ad campaign, too, was sort of like, yeah, maybe come see it.  He was barely out there.  Yeah.  Roland told me they're doing...  He said, the only press they're doing, and this reluctantly, is the Today Show.  Can I get a booster seat?  I got a little seat.  I'm short.  I'm going to need elevator shoes.  I want to wear the shoes that Kiss wore in 1977. 
[01:30:30]  Just so I could be 5'8".  Yeah.  I'm going to be hysterical walking around with Gene Simmons shoes on.  Yeah, I'm a monster.  You'll be the star child.  Somebody told me he had to...  I got Paul Stanley's chest on my head.  Yes.  And Peter Criss's wig.  I'm wearing Peter Criss's wig.  What is that on your head?  Someone told me he had that.  Someone said he had alopecia. 
[01:31:00]  Is that possible?  You ever hear that?  That's that disease.  It's like a temporary nervous disorder where all your hair falls out.  Pacino?  Wow.  At one time.  I don't know.  I don't think he has it now, but it doesn't look like it.  Were they penciling his brows?  Yeah, the whole thing.  He did have some problem with his fingernails.  Maybe that was part of it, too.  There was a movie.  I think it was that one where he's in...  It took place in...  Was it Long Beach?  Was he in that one?  Or was it...  Long Beach.  Long Beach.  Yeah, one of those movies.  I don't know whatever movie it was.  I'll figure it out.  But every time they showed his hands, his fingernails, every one of them were black, like he had 
[01:31:30]  a bad fungus.  Well, no, he's...  Was he going to wear black nail?  No, it was fungus.  They were all thick and gnarly and nasty, and his thumbnail was like a yellowish color.  When he played a cop, was that with like Robin Williams or something?  Of course, he played a cop.  Maybe that was it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that was it.  Insomnia.  That was it.  Insomnia, right.  A cop again.  A cop again.  With my three-quarter length leather.  So I look cool.  And it hides my big shoes. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm wearing those little Kellogg's snack packs on my shoes.  If I don't wear the lifts on my feet, my gun scrapes on the sidewalk.  I got little teeny tiny shoes.  I look like Yosemite Sam.  I fire my guns and lift in the air.  Oh.  Turn, you rabbits.  Now I got to go back to the ship and get another match. 
[01:32:30]  Just to bring Mark into the party, Jimmy went to the premiere with Robert Kelly, and  the movie is a stinker.  P and a U.  Unwatchable.  Like unwatchable.  Unclunker.  And I do believe Al Pacino dies at the end of the movie.  But they won't tell us.  But they won't tell us.  But I'm getting the feeling that it's Al that dies at the end of this horrible movie.  And we're teasing their shoes because there's one scene where Al is kind of sitting there 
[01:33:00]  and you see his little feet sticking out.  His little feet.  And he has little lips on his shoes.  And it was so cute.  Little lips.  Have you seen him before?  Because it's weird when you see guys that are that big of stars and you realize that they're  only that big that you put them in your pocket.  I met Tom Cruise once.  And it was a small guy.  But really small.  Like I went on some audition and I walk in.  I didn't know he was going to be there.  It was a ridiculous audition.  It was a Cameron Crowe movie.  And he was producing it.  And literally the guy was like, you could pick him up. 
[01:33:30]  You felt like picking him up.  Look at you.  Oh, look.  You're like Tom Cruise, only small.  Yeah, a little psychologist doll.  Did you say hi to him?  I said hi to him.  And it was weird because I went in because I did that two second, that two minute bit in  Almost Famous.  So Cameron Crowe teases me with this thing where he has me in to read for two minute things.  And I walk in.  I didn't realize that Tom Cruise was going to be there.  So all my energy just sort of went into just being around this guy because he's this weird  little light bulb of ridiculous confidence. 
[01:34:00]  It's all he brings to the table.  It's like, I'm all lit up.  And it was very disruptive to me.  What's happening?  Let's have a toast.  Starts Friday.  Yeah.  We'll have a toast and then strap the glasses to my feet.  And fill him with a dark liquid so no one sees the shimmy.  But how tall was he?  Seriously.  I didn't see Pacino.  I saw them both sitting in the back rows at the theater. 
[01:34:30]  But they stood up and waved.  But you couldn't tell because he was on the far side of the theater.  But was he next to De Niro?  They were on the opposite sides of the aisle so they could get the hell out immediately.  In the movie, I noticed that.  But I didn't see him in person standing up because I was already in by the time he walked in.  I can't see the movie.  Dr. Ruth sat in front of me.  They've got to sit me on the phone books like when I'm driving.  My little hiney don't reach the seat.  Little tiny guy. 
[01:35:00]  Where's Emilio Estevez?  I need a wig.  Oh, God damn.  Hey, Bob.  Could you get me Maury's wig?  I knew you had it there in our good fella.  You got a wig?  I want to look like I was in the breakfast club.  Maury's wigs don't come off.  Stupid De Niro.  I'll break your face. 
[01:35:30]  Shut up.  Breaking anyone's face anymore.  Exactly.  He should only do comedy now.  He really is.  Terrible.  He should only do comedy.  Because then he can just be a clown.  Yeah, a goof.  A parody of what he used to be.  Yeah, but that's how De Niro comes off now.  He's always a clown.  They're just clowns now because they're caricatures.  Yep.  Pesci, too.  Same thing.  He was always funny.  He was always supposed to be funny.  But, I mean, in Casino, I mean, in Goodfellas, he was a badass.  Same thing with Casino.  Funny as hell, but, you know, that was like, you knew he was a bad guy. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, he was good.  You know, really, really bad.  They were all great in that.  Raging Bull, that's what I asked him to do.  It's just a funny guy.  Hey, I want that wig Pesci wore in JFK.  I want to spray paint it black.  Get the eyebrows, too.  The eyebrows.  I want to look like David Ferry.  The movie's not good, huh, Jimmy?  Oh, it's so good.  It's horrid.  Oh, boy. 
[01:36:30]  What is Rotten Tomatoes?  Horrendous.  We got reviews on the movie, yeah.  And I want, it's like, I don't really fault those guys.  But Casino's acting was actually good in the movie.  It was the fact that the writing was, it stunk.  And they just, the shoot, it was such cornball shots, like, that scene in that big warehouse.  It's like exactly what you'd expect.  It was like this, ugh.  Yeah, but that didn't even make sense, either.  Because he's on the surveillance cam that the cops set up, and all of a sudden the cops  aren't there.  Yeah, I know.  And he's on this camera for like 10 minutes spouting all this crap, and nobody shows up. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, it's stupid silly.  And who, was it Pacino who died?  Did Al die?  No.  Was it De Niro?  No.  Was it Pacino, though?  No.  What do you call that again when you ruin the end of a movie for somebody?  Spoiler.  Spoiler, yeah.  Spoiler.  It's not like we're talking about The Dark Knight, though.  I mean, come on.  I just want to do the whole show like this now.  Yeah, that's all you want to do.  I want to talk like Christian Bale when he's Batman. 
[01:37:30]  I want to ruin that one, too.  It must feel good to be able to do that impression, because that's why he talks like that.  It's relieving.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very satisfying.  But he used to talk like this, like in The Godfather.  It was kind of a slow, low-key thing.  Well, okay, no, I want to bust.  I'm out of order.  You're out of order.  This whole courtroom's out of order.  And then what happened?  Ah!  It happened at the Scent of a Woman.  That was the end of it.  The hoo-ah, hoo-ah thing.  Nope, that started in Sea of Love.  Sea of Love.  It started in Sea of Love, which was before. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, true.  Yep.  I saw him do American Buffalo in Boston, the David Mamet play.  It must have been two years after Scarface.  You know, I was in, I don't know, I was in college.  These footlights are in my eyes!  Yes, but he was still doing Scarface.  I got a scar on my face, so I walked into the bottom of the couch.  But he couldn't shake the Cuban, and that was two years later.  He still had, he still had, it stuck in him. 
[01:38:30]  Really?  Yeah, so maybe these method guys, if you go too deep, it locks in.  Well, this one stayed for years.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Have a lozenge.  Where's their little interview?  Have a lozenge.  Yeah, I want to see their interview.  They're teasing it.  Let's go to Amy in Jersey.  Amy?  I want to see him sitting in the chair with his little legs sticking straight out.  Straight out.  Like a ventriloquist dummy.  He's on Bob's lap.  I got a high chair.  I want to eat some pudding and some gerb.  I'll feed you.  I'll feed you.  I got a fat gut in a sweatsuit. 
[01:39:00]  You know how fat you got to be for your stomach to stick out in a sweatsuit?  Open up.  Here comes the airplane.  I love the airplane.  Feed me, Bob.  Don't get any on my little booty.  Don't get any applesauce on my booty, Bob.  Yeah, or on my Oshkoshpigosh.  It's a little jumpsuit I'm wearing.  Hey, I'm going to turn my wig upside down.  We can eat Reese's Pieces out of it.  Little hairy ball. 
[01:39:30]  Hairy ball.  That's right.  It's a hairy walk on my head, Bob.  It don't move on the back of my neck.  It looks like a Stormtrooper helmet.  My hair's made out of cotton candy.  Stick a pencil in it and twirl it around, boy.  Little chilly, where's my blankie?  Amy, what's up?  Try to get in on this mess.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Amy.  Hi, Amy.  I was at the play Boeing Boeing, and Pacino was about six rows behind us.  And when we walked out at the end of the show, I passed him. 
[01:40:00]  He was right on my left, and I was easily taller than him.  And I'm about 5'4".  Oh, really?  No way.  He's short.  Wow.  5'2", short, 5'3", short.  No way.  They will shoot you.  No way.  Dude, they will shoot you in such a way where you're on level.  Yeah, I understand all that.  It's really weird.  A lot of movie stars are like dwarves.  They are.  They're very little people.  I don't know why that works.  And they've got big heads, usually.  They have a large head, a large bulbous head.  Morton just explained movie making to Opie.  They make it look.  I saw a clip where they...  I was going to get specific. 
[01:40:30]  I've seen footage of somebody where they had to...  Jon Stewart.  They had to dig a ditch.  That's the one I was going to bring up.  It was Jon Stewart, and he's really short.  And he was with his leading lady or whatever it was.  I don't even remember which movie it was, but it was Jon Stewart.  And they dug a trench next to the sidewalk for her to walk in so he could be next to her  at equal height.  Then you've got to double your acting, because then you have to try not to feel small.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How bad is that?  Walk in a ditch, bitch.  Al Pacino does a play. 
[01:41:00]  The rest of the cast is in the orchestra pit.  Talking eye to eye with him.  Al Pacino and just heads.  Al's listed as 5'7", so everyone pushes their height, so that means he's got to be 5'7".  5'7".  He's been 45 years old for the past 10 years.  Paul, Michigan.  How are you, buddy?  Great.  How are you guys?  Hey there, Paul.  Good.  I heard that they used Vern Troyer for his stunt double in this movie. 
[01:41:30]  He's not that short.  He's not quite that short, and I think you'd recognize Vern.  Yeah, Vern's famous.  Yeah, he looks silly.  Paul went too far.  We went literal, guy.  You guys didn't go too far?  No, we didn't accept his joke.  You couldn't accept Paul's little, uh...  No, sir.  He just wanted to fit in today.  That was far-fetched after what you guys did for the last half hour.  Well, true.  We had him eating baby food on Bob's lap.  But the Vern Troyer joke is going too far.  Yeah, the train goes into the tunnel.  Why is that off? 
[01:42:00]  For Stump Rank, can they turn the TV on?  Oh my God, why is that off?  That's where we want it to...  Can we pot this up when they start talking?  We can try.  We can try to do a little something-something.  I'm dying to hear that.  It's a movie.  It's got twists and turns.  Twists and turns.  Action-packed.  Yeah.  What's it about?  Your ticket buys you the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.  That's right. 
[01:42:30]  Or the space underneath, because my feet never reach the floor.  So I never kick popcorn over.  Because I'm tiny.  I got in for half price with Bob.  We can't even go on a ride to Coney Island together.  You gotta be this tall.  Yeah, you can be...  The ride's there, but you can't ride it.  Not tall enough.  It's God's big joke on me. 
[01:43:00]  I could just do that all goddamn day.  I've never done that until today.  I'm gonna have laryngitis.  I don't care.  It's fun.  And I don't care, yeah.  It's worth it.  Too much fun.  It's fun with a capital F.  Oh, yeah!  I want to see them interviewed.  They're just both...  I'm sure they're awful interviews.  This has to be a horrific interview.  The two of them together? 
[01:43:30]  De Niro just breathing into the mic.  Switching.  Smirking.  Yeah.  Doing the imitation of people doing an imitation of him.  Yep.  And De Niro's teeth look like Carmel.  Oh, Jesus.  That blows me away that they...  It's just...  That's from going out with...  Whoa!  Wow.  That's just...  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Come on.  What?  God.  God help us.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, really.  What's wrong with you? 
[01:44:00]  It's a simple beep.  Girls.  He's barely hiding it at this point.  He has to be smooth with his...  Oh, no.  I just spilled water on this.  Give me something.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  The show's gonna go down.  What happened?  He spilled water in front of him, but he doesn't realize there's really nothing there that could  short-circuiting damage anything.  There's a hole that leads to all the wires.  Oh, is it?  A wire hole?  That's what he's cleaning around.  Jimmy, don't put your mouth around the hole.  Nothing's gonna come through like in the bathrooms. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  Jimmy cleans it up with his lips.  All right.  Let's go to Tom in New York.  Tom, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you guys doing today?  Good, Tom.  The funny thing is that you're talking about the height thing.  Actually, what they said was that Marty McFly, Thomas, you know, Michael J. Fox, he was  actually, I don't want to go to the point where he was 6'5".  So they had to shoot all the scenes from a different angle to make them look like they  were the same height. 
[01:45:00]  And Christopher Wally was tired of it because, you know, he wanted to show off his height,  whatever he was saying.  That was his biggest complaint.  Really?  It crapped out.  But yeah.  Michael J. Fox was on a platform for some of the scenes in Back to the Future.  Yeah, they had to shoot that entire movie with a forced perspective.  Really?  Yeah.  With Michael J. Fox in the foreground and Christopher Lloyd kind of in the feet behind  him.  So it kind of looked like they were sort of the same height.  Yeah.  That's why Lloyd always looks hunched over when him and Marty are in the same scene.  Well, he's a giant, though.  Yeah.  Christopher Lloyd's got to be like 6'4", 6'5". 
[01:45:30]  He's huge.  So they did the same thing with the X-Fox.  Right.  He should have just carried Michael J. Fox the whole time.  Now they just strap paint shakers to his feet.  He's a martini glass skit-working.  See, they've been...  They're starting the interview with a montage of Al Pacino and DiNero films.  Do you have the tweet for the volume on it?  And it's just...  You watch these brilliant roles that they had.  The slow digression.  Fantastic acting.  ...ever on the screen at the same time.  In the movie Heat, they finally met face-to-face for just one pivotal scene. 
[01:46:00]  But now, in what can only be called a momentous event, they star together in the new film...  Momentous?  ...Raceous Kill.  You really see us all the fest.  You don't believe in miracles?  You pick up a check one day.  One day.  Then I'll believe in miracles.  One day.  The easiest men to interview...  ...have never granted a side-by-side television interview...  ...until today.  Because the movie stinks and we need help. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, it's over...  ...60s.  In the 60s.  Yeah, the 60s.  When do you first remember being aware of Al?  Well, I was aware of Al...  He was...  I stepped on him once.  Tiger wears a necktie.  What was the first time you remember being aware of his name or his face?  It's interesting you would ask that.  This is riveting.  Because I remember the first time I saw you.  And it was on 14th Street between Avenue B and C. 
[01:47:00]  I was with my girlfriend at the time who was...  A munchkin.  Yes.  I was saying doopity-doo.  In a green way.  Speaking of energy, in watching the movie, you realize that really your natural habitat  is the city of New York.  How much energy do you derive from...  My city?  ...up through the streets.  It never sleeps.  New York is a great city. 
[01:47:30]  It always is changing into what it is at the moment and that's as it should be.  You were both born.  God, he's a bore.  This is horrible.  And it's cut up so badly.  Because it was so boring.  I mean, it's a feast here.  It's great.  And we all know what day it is.  What?  Bob, especially all you've done to help the city.  How often do you get frustrated at, let's call it, the lack of progress since 9-11 downtown? 
[01:48:00]  It is surprising that it's taken this long to get to a point, to get to where we are today.  What?  So I'm...  Shut up.  What?  Surprised.  He's a dolt.  He is a dolt.  He's always been a dolt.  Unreal, and then real, that there was, there's no, no, there's no...  Have you ever talked?  This guy is a...  Never talked, don't.  He's never talked.  Somebody was... 
[01:48:30]  What's that on your head, Al?  That was wrong.  There's birds living on my head.  I really wanted to come back, and I couldn't get back here because there was no...  I couldn't get into the subway without falling through the crack.  To reconnect.  Small.  Speaking of reconnecting, about the movie.  Why?  How much of a rekindling of her friendship had to happen on a movie set?  What?  Well, I...  You know, we've known each other a long time.  We're comfortable with each other, so I think those things help. 
[01:49:00]  Through years and years of doing anything.  He's Big B.  Terrible.  God, give him a script.  Someone give him a script.  The acting goes out of the scene.  You can talk.  Oh, my God.  There's like two black holes up here.  How do you like playing cops?  It's a change.  Why is the nero just threw his hands up?  Not a change!  The cops on and off.  How's it a change, Brian?  You've killed people.  Both of you.  Let's admit it.  Let's get it out.  I like to play people.  Yeah.  I was going to play an ant. 
[01:49:30]  I was cast as an ant.  But they said I was too short.  And you've played...  You've played...  This poor son of a bitch.  Brian Williams, right?  He must just be like...  Was that acceptable the way you just said it?  See it out there?  You're just on the line.  Don't give me that face, because now I think I'm going to get killed.  No, you don't.  Don't worry.  You won't.  You'll get killed in boredom.  You both have this weapon you can use as actors.  Do you ever give that, like, dead-eye look to, like, a poor person who pulls you over or a waitress? 
[01:50:00]  No!  Throw it on somebody on the street just for fun?  We sort of don't need to sometimes, because it comes with the territory.  I was driving, and I drove past this guy's parked car, and I knocked his rearview mirror off.  Totally, totally myself.  With what?  Your antenna?  So I stopped.  And he's in his cloud car.  My mirror, what did you do?  I said, well, whatever, I'll take care of it, you know, whatever.  I rolled down my window.  He came to the window, saw it was me, and he said, no, it's all right. 
[01:50:30]  He surrendered.  Don't worry.  Do fans come up doing you guys?  Do you get that a lot?  Do you get people doing you?  Yeah!  You talking to me?  Oh, he made a joke.  I get it.  Last question.  Oh, big cut.  They edited this with a hatchet.  Yeah, because the video dozed off.  What do you associate when you close your eyes with being yourself and being happiest?  Complex question.  Being with my kids, going away and being with them, that's the happiest I can do. 
[01:51:00]  I look up to my kids, literally.  I look up to my kids and going to, you know, vacation.  He repeated something like that just on a weekend.  He repeated his answer.  He stole Pacino's answer.  Whatever Al does, I do.  I watch the Today Show every day.  Watching the Today Show since I was 10 years old.  So that's when you're happiest.  The happiest, I think, he just said watching the Today Show.  Looking at colorful merry-go-rounds.  Do you know how bad they had to suck to chop that interview up so badly? 
[01:51:30]  That was the best of the best that they could edit together.  When you heard the crew laughing, it was moments where I go, thank God they said one thing that  we could react to.  Wow.  Brian Williams was terrible.  Yeah.  They should have given that to Matt Lauer.  Brian Williams sucked.  He was trying, though, man.  I've never seen a more labored interview on all parts of my life.  Brian Williams was trying.  It was like pulling teeth.  Matt Lauer would have been better.  He's always been sort of a bore, though.  De Niro's always been sort of retarded when he does talk shows.  He goes, Jimmy, it's unreal.  He said nothing.  It's real.  He said he just contradicts it. 
[01:52:00]  It's unreal and real.  He panics like a little boy when they ask him a question.  He can't speak.  He's like Charlie Chesnick was more comfortable answering questions than that idiot.  He needs a script or he cannot speak.  He's horrid.  Shelby's shy.  They had to take De Niro's seat cushion off so he's the same height in the chair.  That's the other floor.  You're not real.  Roland's in studio.  He was at the premiere last night.  Ah, Roland.  I'm over, Roland.  This has become a...  I am. 
[01:52:30]  You're hungover?  Beyond.  What happened?  You don't drink, do you?  Yeah, I did an Anthony.  Oh.  Well.  You shot a bunch of people.  That could be a few things, yeah.  No.  All right.  So the police are after you for Megan's Law?  No.  I almost got a ticket for urination last night, but I didn't.  A ticket for a public urination?  I was in the corner.  I heard, woo, woo.  And it was just a gay guy looking at you?  Woo, woo.  No.  Mmm.  Ooh. 
[01:53:00]  God, that interview was horrendous.  Wait.  How was the movie last night?  Suspenseful.  Suspenseful?  How bad was it, Roland?  You can see it.  Looking around wondering which audience member was going to fall asleep next.  It wasn't that bad.  What?  Ah, he's okay.  He's making a face like, yes, it sucked.  You know, he can't really say what he wants to say.  They were, yeah.  That's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  Was there anybody cool at the premiere, though?  All of them were there.  Ricky Gervais was there.  And Norton goes, I go, hey, how you doing, Ricky? 
[01:53:30]  I was construction worker number three in Ghost Town.  Oof.  And Norton goes, yeah, is there any buzz around his performance?  Oh, did you say that?  Did you really?  Yeah.  I'm like, is there a buzz about him at the studio?  And they talked for a couple of minutes.  I mean, Ricky did remember him.  Yeah, wood sawing buzz.  Hey, Roland, does Al Pacino die at the end of the movie?  No spoilers.  Um, XOXO.  No, I don't know.  I can't say if he dies or not.  Does De Niro die at the end of the movie? 
[01:54:00]  Maybe.  Is there an awful line when someone dies?  Look at that.  We got the nod.  A great nod from Roland.  That's good.  When Roland nods, it looks like when your bowling ball comes back at the bowling alley.  What?  Dumber.  And balder.  I really wish I didn't save Roland last night.  He was about to try to be with the director.  That would have been great.  Thank you.  He didn't know the director was right next to him in the bathroom as Roland started to talk badly about the movie. 
[01:54:30]  Those two together are terrible.  We have to take a break.  We got Marc Maron in studio playing comics later on in October.  Oh, the career is over.  It's like comics is a great club.  We'll get into some other things.  No, but it's not until October.  Yeah.  Oh.  We got a break, Bobby.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Let's get ready to chuckle.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony Church.  Welcome back to Norton and Friends. 
[01:55:00]  Today I have Opie and Anthony, Marc Maron, Roland, Bob Kelly, Kenny, tight slacks, and Stunt Brain and Danny in the studio.  And just so you know, at 10 o'clock, my pre-sale tickets go on sale.  My first show is sold out for the Wilbur Theater in Boston, November 15th.  Second show pre-sale is on sale at 10 a.m.  Go to Ticketmaster and there's a link.  I'll crap.  I'm on my MySpace.  All right.  I'm obsessed with this De Niro. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, everybody is.  I got to try it once.  Yeah.  Hey, Marc Maron.  Now you got it.  Have some melon.  Now you're talking.  I'm eating melon.  I feel better now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to spray paint melons black and tape them to the bottom of my shoes.  To get exercise.  Trying to balance myself.  Thank God.  I feel part of it now.  I met Bobby D.  I put ice in his sink and I was skating for a little while.  Woof. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Boo.  We were all due sooner or later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't.  I want to tease them all day.  What?  We got to ask Marc about the divorce.  Where are we at?  Look, all I know.  Are you almost out of it?  All I know is that three months ago I was a guy with a house.  Here's what happens.  I still, you know.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Okay.  There's no, the bottom line is, is that I got this new gig. 
[01:56:30]  I'm going to be back at Air America.  There's a new guy with money there.  Who is going to, Sam Seder and myself are going to do a daily live comedy talk show on  the internet.  Got no other information than that.  But that's where it's going.  So I get this job after I fought for how long?  A year to hold on to everything on the premise that she had the same amount of money as I  did last year.  Right?  And then I get to.  See where this is going.  Well, no.  I go to, I go to court.  We do the whole number.  And like within weeks of going to court and I, I get the job. 
[01:57:00]  So now she can come back after that.  So I, I settled with her.  I, I, I offered her money.  Yeah.  But that's the thing that I didn't understand is that, uh, you can't fight.  You can't, you can't fight because all of a sudden now I got my wife, I got to settle.  I want to get out of it.  And she's like, well, I spent, I didn't even want to talk about how much money she spent  on legal fees and I got to pay for some of that.  So all the money goes to the lawyers and here's the most pathetic thing about it.  And I hate to admit this.  I hate to admit it.  So now, like I was a guy with a house and I got this job. 
[01:57:30]  I'm back in the apartment that I used to live in in Astoria.  That's just covered with sad grime from three or four lifetimes of me.  All right.  I had a house.  I had a wife at one time and now what am I doing?  I'm sitting in a bed that I used to sleep in with my first wife, whacking it into a black  crew sock, wondering what happened to me.  Yeah.  See?  Huh?  Eating ice cream by myself again.  That is divorce, my friend.  But here's the saddest thing, Anthony.  She calls me the other day with a problem about the settlement, right? 
[01:58:00]  So I get on the phone.  I said, look, just send me the money back.  We'll go back to court.  I don't care anymore.  This is ridiculous.  I don't care.  And she's like, don't yell at me.  Should I call her another time?  I'm like, I'm not yelling at you.  I'm like, I just don't need threats in the, you know, first thing in the morning.  Right?  And then it evolves into like, well, she starts going, I'm just having trouble getting this  in.  I'm like, really?  What's the matter?  So then I start talking.  I'm like, yeah, don't, you know, don't be so hard on yourself.  So now I'm giving her a pep talk.  And I, and I hate to admit this.  Oh my God.  I'm only admitting this because I'm here because I deserve to be beaten. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  At the beginning of the conversation, I'm like, screw you.  We'll go back to court.  All right.  Yeah.  And then the middle of the conversation, I'm like, it's going to be okay.  You know, you just got to put your mind to it.  By the end, by the end of the conversation.  I love you, schmookums.  An hour later, I'm going, an hour later, I'm saying, do you ever miss me?  Oh God.  Remember the time?  Did you do that?  No.  All right.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  I was too busy effing my new girlfriend.  Well, I was doing that too.  What'd she say when you said, do you ever miss me? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  We need the answer.  Yeah.  She said, of course I do.  Of course I do.  Thank you.  What else is she going to say?  And then you never get, you get off the phone, you don't, you don't know whether it was real,  whether it wasn't real.  But the bottom line is, I've been, I get right into another relationship.  I'm dating another girl who's in Los Angeles now.  So now I'm in that thing.  Like, you know, how it, I hope it's Dakota Fanning.  Is she in the business or no?  No, she's in production, but it's just another one of these situations where I'm always attracted 
[01:59:30]  to women who hate themselves for liking me.  And then I, you know what I mean?  Then I don't like them because I'm like, how can you like me?  I'm an ass.  So it is, and then always arguing too.  I don't even know when I'm in an argument with this one.  I, it's literally, I find that after being with two women over a long period of time,  I don't have no understanding of women.  Jesus.  What?  That's the same situation I was in for so long.  I don't even know when we're in an argument.  I called, it's like, you know, I call her up.  I'm like, you want me to come over?  She's like, well, you don't want to come over?  I'm like, what just happened?  What happened? 
[02:00:00]  I just said I wanted to come over.  She goes, well, you didn't say it in the tongue like you really wanted to come over.  I mean, why would I say it in any other way?  I mean, what, are you, you're crazy.  I'm coming over.  And she's like, you have an anger problem.  You know, and it never ends.  Yeah.  I was in relationships for, for so many years.  Monogamous relationships that lasted sometimes eight, between six and ten years.  Right.  At any given time with, you know, three girls pretty much over the course of 20 friggin' 
[02:00:30]  years or whatever it was.  And, you know, then I decide, you know something, I don't want to fall into the same boat here  again.  You can't help it.  And do that.  But, yeah, and you say, you know, you get a certain type, you get a certain type of  girl and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You just wind up falling, like, into the same kind of mold with the same girls.  It's always the same girl with me that's always there.  And I don't know if I talked about this before, but they're always, you know, they're very,  they're smart, they're cutting, they're very pretty, and deep down, they resent every 
[02:01:00]  member of my gender.  And I don't, I don't realize that until, until long after it.  And I just, I just don't know, you know, what the hell it is.  Yeah.  You know, I, I don't, I don't know what it is.  And I, I know that, uh, that most of them have, there's, I just find that if you go  out with somebody at some point, you know, you're going to have to pay for whatever their  father did or didn't do to whatever extent they did or didn't do it.  And I just don't know how many more times I can stick my, into a hurricane.  You know, it's like, if I look into a woman's eyes, there's nothing but chaos and storm. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  You know, I'm like, I'm going in, where's my raincoat?  Why is that?  And I'm just standing there with two things that look like broken jumper cables.  And there's like, you know, camp counselors flying around, Barbie parts.  And wait, that daddy said he was coming to pick me up.  And I'm standing there with two jumper cables going, where's the broken daddy box?  Maybe I just hook directly up to it.  I can ride this out for a while.  And Mark, it's not that you're clueless.  You know, you know, you're getting into another situation, but you do it anyway.  Right.  Because like, if you're sick in the head, what do you think a normal person's going to satisfy  you?  I mean, you can try to bend a normal person into a sicko. 
[02:02:00]  Somewhere you get off on these type of relationships.  That's why you continue to go into them.  Well, I'm programmed that way.  Yes.  Something happens.  I found myself getting into a relationship that was exactly the same as the one I had  gotten out of.  A little bit of a little kind of domineering kind of a thing.  Like, I realized all of my days were kind of being assigned to me. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  And I kind of went like, uh-oh, this ain't good.  And I can't.  But then for some reason, you wind up just jumping in it.  Relationship after relationship, you do that.  So I finally said, no, I'm not doing it.  And then how's that working out?  Great.  It is?  You just detach from it?  I totally detached.  And how do you get satisfaction then if you can't make them cry?  I mean, it's something like I'm really wrong. 
[02:03:00]  I thought that was right.  If I see for a second, if I start seeing that quality, if I may call it, in a woman or a  girl or whatever tween that I'm seeing, I'm out.  I'm out now.  I can't stand for that stuff anymore.  That's good.  That's almost like a drug addict realizing that it's killing her.  It was a moment of clarity.  Yeah.  I mean, I find that for me, it's a challenging that when I find a woman that's got resistance, 
[02:03:30]  that's got fight and hurt, that I want to get down to that level.  I want to see what's really in there and then try not to hurt that.  Is that crazy?  That's your type of nuts, I guess.  Well, no, it's just that you get into this thing where, I mean, I don't want to get too  deep about it because I think about it all the time.  But I just, I get into the thing where there's always arguing, there's always a fight, there's  always that pain of like, you know, I get to a point very quickly with some women, if  I like them, where I'm like, you know, I'm afraid to say things.  Oh, that's odd because I'm no arguing guy. 
[02:04:00]  Really?  Like, I don't argue.  Really?  And that's been as detrimental as you arguing has been for you.  Well, that's like I used to say, I say, like, I've never been good at sports, but I'm really  good at mind games.  I'm excellent at who cries first.  See, I can't do that.  I feel, I do feel really bad when someone gets like hurt like that.  I do right after.  It kind of makes me feel bad.  And then I'm all guilty.  I feel all guilt ridden and stuff.  Yeah, me too.  And then I got to smack myself and go, you're all good, jackass.  Well, I think, you know what I think it is? 
[02:04:30]  I think I'm like a forgiveness junkie that like, you know, you want to push it and push  it and then you're like, I'm sorry.  Oh, so you can get the I'm sorry?  Yeah.  Wow.  No, so I could say it.  Oh, so you could say it.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Take me back.  Oh, come on.  Interesting.  No, we're worlds apart, but kind of similar because we're both crazy.  Yeah, very crazy.  But it did cost me a lot of money, but not the kind of money, but relative to what I have  that.  And that's the one thing I realized if there are guys out there in the sense that if you fight  it, you're just going to lose more money.  And the thing is it quickly as possible. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Because the lawyers, they're in on it.  They keep exacerbating it and dragging it on.  And then they dole out information.  Like, you know, you think like you got some clothes.  You're like, all right, so we're done.  They're like, no, they can still like, why do you tell me that before?  They're going to do this.  It's like, what about in the movies when someone bursts in with some kind of evidence of something  or some kind of situation?  It doesn't happen.  They take it.  The judge sits there.  It's just person A and person B, and they look through paperwork, use math with money  and this.  There's no personal thing to it.  It's not like, oh my God, this guy did this job. 
[02:05:30]  He was responsible for doing it.  She wasn't.  It doesn't work that way.  They go, okay, here's what it's going to be.  So it's worth just settling.  Get the lawyers out of the picture.  Absolutely.  And by the way, mine, tick tock, tick tock.  Almost done.  Really?  It's really close to being almost done.  Me too.  Throw a party.  Oh, the party that's going to be thrown on that one.  You really should throw a huge party.  We'll call the party something else, but we'll all know why you're throwing the massive party. 
[02:06:00]  Mine should be done very soon.  In 10 years?  No, no, I don't think so, because I don't have that much money, and I think that she wants  to be done with me.  But the depression and the anger and the sadness of the whole damn thing, it was ridiculous.  And I'm so tired of being that guy, middle of the divorce guy, because you can't talk  about anything.  No.  You're having an ongoing conversation with whoever's standing there.  People come up to you, it's like, so how are you doing, Mark?  Oh, really?  Then she.  Yeah.  And you're just that guy.  And you're calling people up.  It's like, oh, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  There comes a point where you feel so powerless.  This is something I learned about myself.  There's a part of me, like, I will think about suicide, all right?  Not because I want to kill myself, just because I find it relaxing.  To know that I can, to know that I can if I have to.  It's a viable option?  It's a spiritual reprieve of a faithless person.  You're like, you're sitting there like, oh, this sucks.  Hey, wait a minute.  I can always kill myself.  Oh.  You get a little sigh of relief, and then you move on.  All right.  It's not that bad.  Exactly.  Because, you know, that's there.  I got that option.  All right.  But it's so pathetic.  I might as well just get a t-shirt that says, I'd rather die than try. 
[02:07:00]  My marriage and 9-11 are, I don't know which one is tops for never forget, that I want  on, I want to put it on my back window, you know, never forget, and either put the towers  or the male and female of a wedding cake.  Just stack some money falling over.  Because for me, it was that tragic.  I cannot tell you how awful physically, mentally, everything that divorce was.  It was horrific. 
[02:07:30]  The hatred, there's the most unhealthy thing, physically and mentally, can be carrying just  real hatred.  I don't mean hate like, oh my God, I hate that person, but death wishing hatred on somebody  where if they died, you would laugh.  You would actually laugh your ass off and go, oh my God, there is a God.  That kind of real hate is what it turns into when the lawyers get about the stress.  And it's so, and you can't, it's out of your control. 
[02:08:00]  There's nothing you can do to stop it.  But that's the difference between me and you, and it's weird because you have the one personality  where you don't fight, but you sit around thinking about killing her or whatever, right?  No, it was never killing her.  It was like, if something happened, it wouldn't have bothered me.  See, that's how I know that I'm truly selfish.  Because like, right when this happened, I thought I'm going to kill myself.  If I was more giving, I would have thought about killing her.  You know what I'm saying?  Is that crazy?  No.  And the sad thing is, it's like, I know that I was an ass. 
[02:08:30]  So I can't even play victim, really.  Because I know that I got a part in it.  And honestly, I, and this is, this is like, I'm trying.  I'm trying just to think like, you know, well, I hope everything works out for her.  I hope that everything, because I don't want to carry it for the rest of my life.  Because if I think about the money, that's the worst thing is, you've got to compartmentalize it.  It's just this thing you don't have anymore.  You can't think about the numbers or anything.  Don't think about what you lost.  Don't think, no, no.  Because if you do, you're just like, wow.  I was in a situation where, like, I didn't consider it my fault. 
[02:09:00]  I didn't consider that I was the bad guy in this.  I had been miserable for so long.  There was no love there.  It was just, it was just this habit.  I went to a place at night when I wasn't working, and, you know, I called it home, and she was there.  And that's pretty much what it was.  There was no, there was no love there.  There was no nothing.  And, and I was in this, for years, I was in this thing where I had, I felt like I would save bar rags. 
[02:09:30]  Like, I would just go and get these girls and just, like, try to be their savior or something.  Help them out, throw them a line.  What the frick am I doing?  Jesus, you were Jesus.  Like, look, I could do this, okay, this girl's at a bar, and she's, like, railing 20 guys a week, and this, but I could, I could change that.  She's perfect.  And for some reason, why the hell do I want to do that?  Yeah.  You know, what am I, who am I changing?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Yeah.  But that's, like, the personality I have.  Like, oh, yeah, let me save this one. 
[02:10:00]  That's weird, because I'm, I'm the opposite.  I'm like, we help me.  Please help me.  Really?  Yeah.  God, we are, like, polar opposites, man, but in the exact same boat.  Yeah, exactly.  The thing was, is that the sad thing is that I realized that when I went home, like, the last few months of the marriage, like, she, like, obviously she just took her vagina and she left.  Yeah.  But there was a period there where she was, you know, detached from the vagina, but still there.  Right.  And it said, I'd almost rather that, though, because at least it's there, you know, and at least she's there, and she's pretending to some degree. 
[02:10:30]  Oh.  But that was, that was the most painful, is that when you're in the marriage, and then you realize, like, she left already.  Yeah.  And there's nothing you can do to, there's nothing.  Yeah.  There's nothing you can do.  Well, in the last couple of months of my marriage, I'd have gone crazy if I didn't have my girlfriend there, too.  Well, I didn't do that.  I was so proud of myself.  It was, hey, wife, get out.  Were you guys ever, can I ask you a question, as a newly married man?  Oh, boy.  Were you guys ever happy and really in love at the beginning? 
[02:11:00]  Here's how I courted.  Never.  I was married, here's the thing, I was married when I met her, right?  You know my wife, you both know my wife, my ex-wife.  I was married when I met her, so I was, and I fell in love with this woman, with Mishnah, right?  Right.  So I fell in love with her, and I couldn't stop it.  So I was happy, but it's a really scary thing when during courting, like, if you're trying to get a girl to fall in love with you, if you ever hear yourself say this, I'm about to leave the other one.  Do you love me or what? 
[02:11:30]  Are we doing this?  Are we doing this?  And she's crying, saying, yeah, okay, okay.  Like, good.  I'm moving in.  So if that's the process that you went through, you're going to have trouble.  Might be a problem, right?  I got an ultimatum.  I got the ultimatum from my wife, finally.  After months, after about two months of a pretty good threesome going on, I got an ultimatum.  It's like, that's it, me or her.  And I went, all right, take it easy. 
[02:12:00]  Look, I never swept around.  I like the new stuff here.  Sorry.  She wasn't thinking right.  No, she wasn't.  That's a decision that was very obvious to everybody looking.  It was like, oh, boy, did you give me the wrong ultimatum?  Oh, my God.  I was completely monogamous with this one.  I loved her, and that's the sad thing about it.  Three months after, I went out with somebody else.  What was your wedding song?  We like to make sure we get the wedding song in.  Wedding song?  I got married in my backyard with 15 people there. 
[02:12:30]  What was your song with the one that's killing you right now?  Time is Told Me by Nick Drake.  All right, Danny.  We've got to find that.  Hey, Concho Pete, really fascinating.  Concho Pete?  That's pretty good.  It's Kenny Meyer's horse out in California.  He goes, holy S, when I got my divorce, the ex labeled me as a gay, drug addict, alcoholic to everyone.  My parents visited me with an intervention.  They believed her BS.  Wow.  Voss's ex-wife.  Hey, hey, off it.  Did you ever have sexual fantasies about your ex-wife since you broke up? 
[02:13:00]  Never.  I do.  Never.  Oh, this is going to hurt you.  Dude, I got to the point where I had to think of someone else.  But now that you've separated for all these years, you don't ever catch, like, she never  drifts back in while you're trying to scrap?  Never.  Wow.  Never.  You know it's never.  Wait, Anthony, really fast.  Who would you think of?  So you're having sex with the wife.  You don't want to think about her anymore, and you said you would have to think about 
[02:13:30]  other things.  Various chicks that have been on the show.  Really?  Yeah, from, like, the Boston days and the Kahlua girls that we used to go with.  You technically finally had sex with the Kahlua girls.  The Bean Party girls.  Jesus, let me think.  There's a lot more.  Boob art.  Boob art girls.  The Boob art girls.  The...  You've got a hell of a rotation.  The girl from the voyeur bus that was kind of flat-chested.  She wasn't bad, but she had a great ass on her. 
[02:14:00]  I have a bunch of them.  She's tall and thin from the voyeur bus.  Remember her?  So the girls really helped you out from the radio show over the years.  Ladies, I've got to say thank you so much.  This is new info coming out today.  Yeah, it was very nice of you to be there in my head.  You know, it's...  Mark, I like my wife.  I still like her.  Yuck.  You still fantasize about her, though?  Wow, you're a weird guy.  Yeah, but the thing was, is I knew...  Well, it's just the fact that at some point, you know, I can't just say that she just left  for no reason.  She didn't go out with another guy. 
[02:14:30]  She filled up with my bile and could no longer carry it anymore and lost herself and left.  So, I mean, there's a point where...  So you're completely blaming yourself for this, then.  Does it sound like that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You are Mr. Blame Me.  He'd go back with her in a second.  A little something for Mark Maron today.  Just to bring back good memories.  What are you trying to do?  Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring out the brand new Mr. and Mrs. Maron.  Let's bring him out here.  Even though it's in a backyard.  No, that was mine.  You guys are killing me.  You said backyard, too, right? 
[02:15:00]  Backyard?  Yeah, you know, there was like four people there.  Louis C.K. came down and like maybe, you know, seven other people.  Oh, shoot.  This is so creepy.  This is really hardcore.  Oh, is that bad?  You're making people cry in their cars.  Because this could be a...  You guys are bastards.  Let's call her.  What did you wear?  What did you wear on your wedding day?  I wore a blazer.  It was nice.  She was...  It was...  Someone brought a cake.  It was very low-key.  Her mother got ordained in the Universalist Church to do this. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, God.  I finally remembered my wedding song, by the way.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  It was...  And it's the truth.  It was...  One whiskey, one shot, one beer.  No, it's actually that song, High Enough, by members of Night Ranger and Damn Yankees.  Damn Yankees high.  Ew.  All right, let's end the next portion of the show with Anthony's wedding song.  Oh, horrible. 
[02:16:00]  Listen, we got to go, Mark.  Let's listen to Uncle Ted.  Don't get married.  Yeah, Uncle Ted says, don't get married unless you're going to shoot an Elf.  All right.  We get it, Ted.  Mark Maron's going to go over to XM with us today, but I got to tell you, I try to see  Mark every time he's in town.  He's a brilliant comic.  He's going to be at Comics.  I'm at the Cellar all the time, too, because I'm living here now.  So you could come by a little more often.  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  It'd be good to see you a little more often.  Nice open guy.  I like that.  Honest.  You're going to be playing comics in October 24th and 25th.  People aren't going to remember, but just keep Mark Maron in mind when you're thinking 
[02:16:30]  about seeing a new comic, someone you haven't seen.  If you want to see someone you've seen.  A new old comic.  New old.  Well, you know, it's new to somebody else.  No, no, absolutely.  I'm trying to get you new people.  I won't be sad when you come.  I swear.  I got two shows on sale.  Oh.  No, go ahead.  Oh.  Over the high enough.  Stress Factory, 7, 8, 9 of November.  I don't want to hear about it anymore.  November 15th.  Second show in Boston.  Pre-sale in one hour.  My MySpace. 
[02:17:00]  This is Anthony's wedding song.  I don't know why.  Wow.  What's it doing to you right now?  Seriously.  It's making me realize how much money has been...  So that's what happens?  I just hear Dominic Barber sing it.  We don't need to talk about it anymore.  Settle with her.  Can you both share in your success?  Shut up.  Share.  Would you like to kiss her right now to this song?  I just made one mistake.  What?  It took too long, Dan.  I'm trying to think of a scene where someone's kissing and bites someone's tongue out. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  But I couldn't.  He'd rather kiss...  Paint lips on an anvil.  He'd rather kiss Roland.  I must be a glutton for punishment.  I swear to God, I really must be addicted to pain.  Yeah.  Knife Girl.  No, Knife Girl didn't do it for me.  No.  What about the one...  I have a distinct type.  What about the one...  I've been told.  Yeah, young.  Let's part.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  What about the one where...  What, in Boston?  Where we learn things after...  Oh, in Boston?  You know the... 
[02:18:00]  I know the you're talking about.  That's all I can say.  In a second.  Boy, a news station had a...  I had a fine piece of video that they had no idea about.  She was on my shoulders naked.  It's all right.  Statue of Limitations is up.  Girl's probably frigging 20 by now.  I was going for the same joke.  I was going for the same joke.  Let's get it going for 24.  Ah, whatever.  Very good at it.  All right.  There's his wedding song.  We got to get the hell out of here.  Yeah, let's go over and say curse words. 
[02:18:30]  And porn stars today over there, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  We will have porn girls at XM.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Very happy.  That's how we answer that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  In the world of radio shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[02:19:00]  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  I still didn't know something.  Opie and Anthony.  Cat shovel baseball.  Oh, nice.  Oh, that was mad.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work? 
[02:20:00]  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Where's my, my, my, my MFS?  All right.  Yes, we're here at, uh...  Where's mine?  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Who hooked this up?  They gotta come up with a new name for this company.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  Where'd we just begun?  What's wrong?  Where's my headphones?  What is MFS?  Uh, that's not the...  It's a motherfucker's studio. 
[02:20:30]  What's mad?  Where's my headphones?  What's wrong?  Who sets up the studio every day?  Who sets up the studio every day?  Oh my God.  Fuck this place!  Fuck it!  That sounds like me.  My new favorite clip.  What is that from?  Fuck this place!  What is that?  Fuck it!  Anthony?  That's from Shawshank Redemption.  Who's saying that?  Um, I believe that was the new kid that came in that, uh...  Did he just get raped or something?  He was trying to teach him...  No, no.  Um... 
[02:21:00]  I didn't see it.  Hey, I gotta interrupt you.  And we can figure that out in a second.  MSNBC couldn't help themselves.  Yeah, yeah, they had to do it.  They're the ones that had to get the 9-11 footage on TV for everybody.  But they're running over and over.  I just saw the second plane hit for the, uh, you know...  I haven't seen it since last September 11th.  Thank you, MSNBC, for reminding me.  Shitty Oberman is the one who was complaining about the McCain campaign.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then hear these fucking assholes do it.  Is this at all necessary?  I don't think Fox has done it yet.  What's the matter?  CNN hasn't done it.  MSNBC, though, can't help themselves. 
[02:21:30]  Fuck it, man.  CNN show...  Yeah, get a real good close-up there so we can see a jumping guy.  Jumping, uh, you know, because they know they'd rather die falling than burning to death.  I remember that morning.  When I was in Astoria, and when I woke up, I went online, and I saw that the first tower  had gone down and thought it was some sort of ridiculous joke, and then I realized  what was going on.  I went on the roof of my building in Astoria, and do you remember that day?  It was crystal clear.  It was the most beautiful day in the world.  Not a cloudless guy.  Not a cloudless guy.  No humidity.  And then they shut down everything. 
[02:22:00]  There was not a car on the street, not an airplane in the sky.  Yeah.  Complete silence.  Just this horrible, smoking, mass at the end of Manhattan.  This is MSNBC.  You know, this is way worse than nappy-headed hoe, you dummies.  Yeah, I know.  This is like-  You dummies.  That's the station that took Imus off-  You dummies.  ...for offending people, and like, this is-  This doesn't offend anyone?  We all know what happened.  There's a reason why they're putting this on TV.  If the New York Post didn't put it on the cover, what do they got about this? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Some people say they're showing it, and they should, because you don't want to forget  how horrible it was.  You'll get that argument.  People will call and say that.  Right.  But, believe me, we remember it without having to see it.  Right.  It's not the visual thing.  You know, you don't have to be horrified twice, or three times, or twenty times to remember.  Let's see which candidate shamelessly exploits it today.  Well, they're both down to count zero at the same time.  Today?  Yeah, they're getting together a little bit today.  I was just down there, but I was buying sheets that had nothing to do with anything. 
[02:23:00]  Ah.  I haven't said change what he was.  I was, too.  Do you know how to make one into a pointy hat with some holes in it, too?  No!  Sure, I got you one.  I bought you one today.  You want it?  Yeah.  Let's see Oberman take on the bosses, as far as, you know, showing this footage.  That fucking faggot has never spoken out against his bosses.  No.  Ever.  While he waits for their lead.  Who?  Oberman?  What's your problem with him?  He's the fucking worst.  You like the Oberman?  In what way?  I don't watch him.  He's a phony pit bull.  He's a safe attacker.  Right.  Like when Imus was getting fired, he waited for the bosses. 
[02:23:30]  He fucking bitched behind the scenes.  He didn't want to put his dick out in the wind.  He's a fucking phony, man.  I don't, you know, it's like, even though he's a lefty, I don't watch the show.  I don't watch much television.  I know he stood up to at least speak his opinion politically, but you're saying behind the scenes.  Even that shit.  Where was his fucking outrage about Jesse Jackson wanting to rip Obama's balls off?  Where was that outrage?  Right, right.  Or Jesse saying nigger, which he did say under his breath.  Where was that?  Yeah, he did.  That fucking inconsistent shit.  Well, he's afraid.  He figured that. 
[02:24:00]  Of course he's afraid.  Like when Jesse was in studio, he was lapping his ass.  Well, Reverend, are shows like Rush Limbaugh on notice now?  This is when they, I'm, for what?  Right.  Why should they be on notice?  So you're saying he plays it by a double standard.  He's a pussy.  He's a politically correct pussy.  I've got to jump in here.  This is, I did not know this.  Jason in Virginia Beach.  It gets even better.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I was switching in between Fox and MSNBC last night, and I caught the last 10 minutes  of Keith Overman's show, and he was bashing the Republicans and John McCain for showing 
[02:24:30]  the 9-11 footage at the Republican convention.  How'd you say that?  He was being just as typical.  No, but didn't you know that Overman was bashing him last night?  No, but that's what I was saying.  They were attacking him for that.  Well, he's doing it last night.  So you're saying it's hypocritical because the network he's on is now showing that footage?  Yeah.  So let's see if he addresses it tonight.  He won't.  He won't.  That's the point we're making.  Please get the audio of him last night.  It made me sick.  Yeah, he's a fucking douchebag.  He's a hypocrite.  That's what we hate about this fucking guy. 
[02:25:00]  I'm so glad they yanked him off the desk.  He couldn't do his fucking job well enough to be slightly unbiased.  Everyone's biased.  Right.  But he's so bad at his fucking job.  Yeah.  And that fucking cornball he threw David Schuster under the fucking bus for saying pimp out Chelsea  Clinton like she's this fucking holy grail that you can't criticize, and then there's  footage of him saying that Bush pimped out fucking Petraeus.  Like he knows in our culture the way we use that term.  Right.  So your issue is that he's a hypocrite.  And a phony.  And a cornball.  Right.  Yeah.  And I'm tired of this image.  Like he's this scary.  Oh, don't get Oberman, man. 
[02:25:30]  Fuck him.  You know what's amazing about this show?  What?  We go three hours without a curse, and we're so smooth.  They build up.  We don't even think twice.  They build up.  And I heard 10 fucks.  Curse.  Curse retention.  Hey, Nashville wants in.  Kurt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I was watching the same thing last night, and they said, he said they were going to go  show three pictures.  One of a fireball, one of a guy jumping just killed.  These motherfuckers are sick.  Oh, I'm so pissed.  It's not even funny. 
[02:26:00]  I lived in New York.  I moved south.  People here, some of them get it, and some of them don't.  I'm just fucking goddammit.  I guess they're showing it in real time or something.  Because that's their way of going, look, we're showing it in real time as a news event, instead  of highlights.  I can understand that guy, because when you were here, the post-traumatic stress that  lasted for six months, people walking around with that smell, with that glaze in their  eye.  Remember doing comedy?  They opened up the Lower East downtown within two weeks of it, and that people were so in 
[02:26:30]  need of relief, but they were so shell-shocked.  You would do jokes, and they'd laugh like, ah!  Yeah.  Like, it was almost like a scream.  Are we supposed to?  Ah!  Oh, no!  Ah!  But they needed relief, because you could smell that burning pit for weeks.  That's what, yeah, people need to understand that aren't in the New York area.  The smell is what everybody will remember the most.  I even started to...  That smell was disturbing.  And you could smell way up here.  How many miles are we from ground zero?  And you didn't even know what it was.  Five, maybe?  Five, six miles from here?  It was like melting metal. 
[02:27:00]  And I even started to resent people that would come here to gawk at the pit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I resented people that would judge New York in the Midwest.  Like, New Yorkers are all fags, and New Yorkers are out of control.  But as soon as it was down, as soon as that happened, they all flock here to help out.  Yeah, snap a picture next to it.  Yeah, it was a little disconcerting.  Yeah, so...  Well, they're showing in real time, so I guess that makes it okay.  And everyone was treating New Yorkers like they were the girl who got raped at the office.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:27:30]  Like, hey, you know, I heard what happened.  You know, we saw it from the window.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, change the fucking channel then.  Change the subject.  Yeah, we have fucking very sexy girls outside.  I know.  We're sitting in a certain building such a like depressed...  That looks like a good...  I was checking...  I can't believe this is a continuous stream of this shit.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's in real time.  Oh, they're out there playing it as if it was that morning?  Right.  Like, we needed that?  That's the exact same time and everything, so that's how they...  Maybe it'll end different.  No?  Yeah.  A time machine.  Too soon?  Yeah.  Need a DeLorean. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, put on something else.  Go back in time.  It's a little rough.  They're going to run it all day?  Yeah, put something else on.  We know how it ends.  They fall down.  Yeah.  Put the dog whisperer on, Danny.  Put on something hot.  Hey, we got some...  Hot.  It's hot at nine.  Yeah, bring the girls.  Are we allowed to call them porn stars?  I don't know where we're at.  Some...  Yeah.  Adult film stars?  Some get mad when you call them porn stars.  How about just adult film?  Let's call them helpers.  Ooh.  People who help.  Do they come in?  People who help.  People that help get the poison.  I'm very excited.  Did you walk over with them, Jimmy?  I haven't been here with them.  Of course I did. 
[02:28:30]  What were the guys...  Did you just watch guys gawking?  I was just chatting with pre-all singers.  No, no.  Were you watching guys just gawking at them?  Were the guys just uncontrolled?  I didn't look.  I'm sure they were.  See, that would have been...  I would have done a social experiment and just looked at the guys looking at these girls  because they probably would have, you know, tripped over their own dicks.  The only guy I looked at looking at the girls was the fucking creep.  That Mr. Whipple-headed guy who I suspect is a pederast.  Who just stares at everybody when we walk in.  Fucking...  He's obsessed with our show. 
[02:29:00]  Like the guy at the sushi place.  He's the worst.  There's a guy.  Why'd they move her?  Yeah, why'd they move her?  What the hell?  I'm fucking married.  I got excited.  I couldn't breathe correctly.  She was sitting right next to me and now she's way over there.  Now you just made my reality, reality.  Just far away from...  Hi, miss.  I'm divorced and I'm afraid that it's just going to be, you know, just like desperation in  my eyes right now.  Yeah, Mark's going through, you know, very tough time.  Very tough time.  Yeah, very tough time.  I'll be all right.  I'll be all right, though.  I'm going to be okay.  So, tough times.  That's the look you're seeing in his eyes. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the pain.  Despair.  Denny, you guys want to melt this ring down for anything?  What do you mean?  That's his wedding ring and he wants you to melt it, saying that he doesn't want to be  married anymore, gazing upon your beauty.  What do we want to do with that wedding ring?  I got some ideas.  What do you mean?  Put it in...  Oh, God.  You got a love of a sick mind.  I got some ideas.  It's for the show, though.  You can tell her it was for the show.  Yeah, it's for the show.  And then it comes back a different color.  Yeah, well... 
[02:30:00]  Adult film star?  Yes.  Yeah.  That's me.  Jiminy Cricket.  Adult film star, Brie Olsen.  And we also have Caden Cross here.  Hi.  Hi.  Are you the more shy of the two, Caden?  Always.  Why are you so shy?  I'm not sure.  You sound like De Niro.  I know.  She's actually a better interviewer than he is already.  That fucking mumbling idiot he is.  The 9-11.  De Niro stinks.  It wasn't the 10th.  Thank you, stupid. 
[02:30:30]  I don't get shyness, because you're naked, and that doesn't bother you as far as being  shy, but something like this is like...  Yeah, I can walk naked down fucking Fifth Avenue, but I couldn't...  Really?  That's so weird to me.  Let's go with that.  Isn't that weird?  I love it, though.  I love that she's shy.  I mean, I love a confident girl, but a nice shy one, just, hey.  A shy one walking naked?  Takes her clothes off and punches you in the face?  Calls you a faggot?  Do you do hardcore porn, or do you do softcore? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I do hardcore.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Jimmy, what is the definition of hardcore porn?  Hard cocks in mouth or in vagina, I would say.  Money shots.  Money shots.  And probably open vagina licking, I would say, they don't show in softcore, do they?  I hate that.  No.  I don't think they don't show it.  I think it's hardcore.  What's that?  If you can see pink.  Oh, okay.  Ass licking?  Things like that?  That is, yeah.  But in the softcore, you mean like hotel room porn?  Sure.  Where you're sitting there like, just move the camera.  Move.  Yeah.  They keep panning back to the guy's dumb face.  You know what? 
[02:31:30]  Worst fucking thing ever is when you're trying to scrap one out, and they go to the guy's  face going like, ugh.  And then they go to the same shot again.  I don't want to see that.  There's no girls fucking masturbating to this, or a very small percentage, let's say.  Mostly guys in a hotel room jacking it.  And then they got to show the guy's face.  Why?  The angle of the guy's asshole and peach slapping.  Oh, the bobshot we call that.  Back of balls?  They don't show that stuff on softcore.  It's just balls slapping?  And you know his asshole had some shit in it because it just all wrinkled? 
[02:32:00]  Jesus, Bobby.  Wow.  There's a lady in the room.  Why the hell would you watch that anyway?  You suck the sexiness out of the room.  No kidding, Bobby.  Like a fucking spaceship.  No, that's what I meant.  I was like, I don't like that shit.  I don't like when they show the fucking guy's asshole.  But once in a while, if you watch those softcore, they will show a dick in the mouth for a few seconds.  They almost keep giving you these little treats.  They just show the hand, though.  No, they'll show everything.  It's like a hardcore shot that was edited differently.  Why would anyone watch that in a hotel unless they didn't have Wi-Fi at the hotel?  You can just go online.  Over the years.  Not now.  Not now you don't.  Yeah, it's getting better there, Bobby. 
[02:32:30]  This is good.  With the hot girls, we were first told by September 11th, now we're analyzing pornography.  We can do it with the digital era.  Well, let's get to know the girls.  What's the move you're known for, for everybody out there?  Move?  Yeah, these girls, they got a specialty.  I know.  Some girls squirt, some girls do that.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  What's the one thing you do that you're known for?  Well, my goodness, I've been in the industry for most two years now.  I came into the industry doing anal, doing all of that right away.  Jumped right in. 
[02:33:00]  So I did.  I like that.  Go get her.  I jumped right in doing everything.  And this past year, I won eight awards, seven of them Best New Starlets, and Adam and Eve  Contract Star, and just been working on a lot of movies lately.  We just did Roller Dolls, which you guys have some copies of.  So that's a huge movie.  A lot of hotties in it.  Did you, before you got in the business, were you sexually promiscuous, maybe in school?  We heard her story.  I'd want to hear it again.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:33:30]  Maybe more details.  Can't jerk off to that twice.  Like, you know, he's saying, you know, you jumped right in with anal and stuff like that.  Right.  Probably not the first time you had anal on set.  It was on set.  I mean, maybe a boyfriend or something.  Right.  I don't think you remember, because when she tells the story, you're going to really appreciate  it.  Can we do this interview?  Because I remember this one.  I'm new to the story, so I'd like to hear it.  Can we do the interview with the table up?  You said that you were underage.  I remember underage and having sex with a much older guy.  Like, he was really a lot older.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Really?  Like how much older?  You were underage.  Can I say how old you are?  You sure are.  You probably don't want me to say how old you are.  Oh, yes, we do.  No, you can.  Yes, we do.  I do.  Okay, I was 12.  All right.  Jesus.  And how old was he?  How old was the gentleman?  In his 20s.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  How'd you meet this guy?  He lived across the street.  He was a Jehovah Witness.  Had he been courting you since you were six?  A Jehovah's Witness.  Did you know he was a Jehovah's Witness?  Yeah.  Wow.  And people found out he got kicked out of his church, and he lost his fiancee and everything 
[02:34:30]  else.  Oh, he had a fiancee?  I didn't look 12, though.  I really did.  I looked 16.  All he said was, it was all worth it.  Yeah.  So he came over with some Watchtower magazines?  You know, I mean, girls these days, they look, you know, I developed early, and I wore  the makeup and everything, and I was really asking for it.  Holy shit, you were asking for it.  Your breasts are real, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Did he get in trouble, though?  Yeah.  Did he get in trouble?  Did he get in trouble?  How did anyone find out?  Nothing legal.  Nothing legal.  Your parents are nothing?  What the fuck is the filth bags we are.  How could he avoid getting in trouble?  How could he have kept it a secret? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  How did people find out?  Well, I had a boyfriend that was about my age at the time, and I wanted to lose my virginity,  but he was still too scared, because he was a virgin as well.  Oh, I hate that.  So I cheated on him with this 20-something-year-old guy and lost my virginity to him instead, and  I ended up making my confession, and so he went and threatened that guy and told his  church and everything.  He threatened a 12-year-old?  No.  Oh, no.  The 12-year-old threatened him.  Oh, okay.  So was it good? 
[02:35:30]  Did you enjoy yourself?  Yeah, I loved it.  You did?  I loved it, yeah.  Well, obviously.  And I kept coming back from war, too.  Oh, you did?  So, yeah.  How many times did he fuck you?  Several.  Several times.  Did he do anything like, did you suck his dick?  Of course.  And did he fuck you in the ass?  No.  No.  You saved that for later.  This was 12.  Yes.  She's sucking dick and getting fucked at 12.  The ass is off limits?  You're checking this off like it's a fucking subway work.  All right, did he lick your shit or no?  Fuck your tits?  No.  What did the guy say, hey, I have morals.  I'm not going to fuck her in the ass.  No, no.  But her hiney at that age was probably not prepared. 
[02:36:00]  Still Gerber's coming out of it.  It was a tiny little hiney.  Can I ask you a question?  Well, Al Pacino feet hiney.  Sorry, go ahead.  They fucked me in the ass.  I was only 12.  Ow.  Where would you do it, though?  At your house, his house?  Yeah, just when my parents weren't home or at his house.  Oh, wow.  So he would come to your house.  Well, we lived right across the street from each other.  But you lived with your parents.  That must have fucking freaked him out.  It must have been such a turn on thinking your parents are going to come up the driveway 
[02:36:30]  in a second.  Smell like bubble gum at homework.  It was so hot, though, because, I mean, he was like this executive, like all in a suit  and glasses.  At 20?  Yeah.  20-somethings.  I mean, like 26, 27.  He'd show up in a suit with his glasses?  Yes.  Well, he wore it a lot because, you know.  His white glasses with the fake eyes that came out.  Those two witnesses, they went to church, like, Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays.  He was at church all the time, so he was always dressed up.  What does he have when he was fucking a 12-year-old?  His name was Chris Hansen.  I love that show. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, I bet you do, but you're rooting for the guy.  So, come on.  Go for the cookies.  Let him go.  Your breasts are real.  Yes, sir.  Well, no, I just, I, I've done a fair pass.  Can I just guess what size they are first?  Yeah, sure.  First.  It's a 30, 34 C.  No, D's.  34 C.  Are they D's?  Cares.  Let her show them.  Fuck.  D's or C's?  What do you think now?  Holy fuckaroonies.  Can I just say something?  I mean, honest to fucking God, those are just the best fucking motherfucking tits ever. 
[02:37:30]  Goddamn microphones are in the way.  There's no way to say it.  There's no way to talk, Bob.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Those are just, those are guys.  Goddamn.  I'm on it, you fucking sons of bitches.  They're all yelling at me on pal talk.  And you know what's great is your nipples are just perfect, too.  Your areolas.  I like how.  Areolas.  Thank you.  A little fucking.  Are you supposed to react to those?  What are you, a doctor?  You're supposed to go on fucking light switches.  Holy mackerel.  Dude, I did that.  I said, holy fucking cunt fuck shit.  Do you want to suck them, baby?  Yeah, I can't. 
[02:38:00]  I'm fucking married, and I want to suck them.  Ask me one more time.  Are you wearing underpants?  No.  You don't have fuck.  I have to go.  I have to go.  I'm going to piss my jeans right now.  Last time she.  She is fucking.  We've got to make another video today, because when we make videos with you, wow, we get  some views.  Is this the girl who.  Yes.  This is her.  Yes.  Dude, this show.  The last video we made with her got over a million views all over.  I think it was break.com on that one.  She has a very lovely hiney, too, if you don't mind me saying that. 
[02:38:30]  What can we do?  Thank you.  That'd be a great publicity if you hire her just to write fucking your comedy connection, October  24th at the Wilbur Theater on her.  What?  That'd be a great little fucking promotion.  Stop, Bobby.  You know what?  Stop.  That's not a fucking bad idea.  That's a fucking great idea, Opie.  If we get a good video, we'll do that.  I'm just saying.  That'd be a great idea.  What kind of video could we make today?  I say we get Joe Businessman off the street and just bring him up here and give him the  surprise of his life.  That's kind of what I was thinking.  Oh, you want it?  That's what Jim Norton's face sat on. 
[02:39:00]  Joe Businessman works as well.  I mean, you know.  Dude, but you should get somebody with a ring.  Yeah, you're going to do that on video.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Put a bag on his face.  Let's get someone on the street.  Put a bag on him.  Put a bag on him.  Hold on, hold on.  What would you do with Joe Businessman if we got him up here right now?  I don't know.  It depends.  We want to work within your limits.  I'd fuck him.  Whoa.  Really?  All right.  Why not?  She's so great.  I fucking love her. 
[02:39:30]  And Shy One, I love you too.  I love you, Shyness, because I know it.  We don't know much about your story.  Yeah.  I don't have stories like that.  That's why.  You just got into the business.  How long have you been in the business?  A year and a half.  Jesus.  A year and a half.  You fucking ghoul.  Santa Claus is here.  Look at this creep.  Santa Claus is here.  Put something in there.  I brought stuff to put in there.  They opened Pat Duffy's duffel bag.  Jesus.  I forgot this guy's name, but he just came in with a freak.  How about she straps that fucking strap-on on and fucks you in the ass?  This is a strap-on. 
[02:40:00]  Of course it's a strap-on.  Come on, Bobby.  You've seen that before.  Not this big.  And he's never seen it.  It's always been behind him.  I love all his hair on it.  Take that back.  And it's never been white.  And it's never been a strap-on.  That's right.  And it's never been that small or thin.  It didn't have straps.  No.  Exactly.  He just had hips and a guy torso.  Flushy straps.  And a hairy chest.  We got it.  We got to get a video.  We got to get a video made today.  We can get a guy with a fucking...  Yeah, I got to put a bag over his head or something.  Give him a...  Do something, whatever he wants. 
[02:40:30]  A lap dance.  A lap dance?  I've never gotten one.  I think there's...  You've never gotten a lap...  Isn't it your birthday?  No.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Good improv.  Never deny.  I know.  What was he saying?  What?  Sam was saying that if we bring somebody up off the street, we do have a spare bunny  mask we can put on them.  Oh.  That is anonymity.  We'll look like The Shining.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you know how many O&A fans are just running to walk by the street?  Putting a suit on?  Yeah, just putting a suit on and just walking back and forth.  Would you... 
[02:41:00]  You're married?  Look at that big guy right there.  Look, he's fucking...  That is fantastic.  You, sir, the galoot.  Yeah.  The one taking up the whole bench.  Yeah, we got that...  Oh, that's fantastic.  We got the black Marty Feldman.  I mean, how are we not working with fucking one of these guys?  Look at the guy in the front, too.  My buddy in the kilt.  The little Boston guy with his wife.  Right here.  This guy, yeah.  What about you, sir?  You know.  Now you can't do it?  Because your girl's right there?  Well, how about our fucking mess intern?  What if she gave you permission?  Would you do it?  I say we go with Joe Businessman with a ring. 
[02:41:30]  Danny, go down the street.  Let's feel this out, at least.  All right.  Call the show and talk to guys walking by with wedding rings.  Yeah.  Tell them we might have a special...  I want to see if these guys can be touching.  But make sure it's not a good wedding ring with a lot of diamonds and they have a lot of money.  Make sure it's like a shitty wedding ring.  You know he's depressed.  He's got no money.  He needs it.  Like a rusty, fucked up wedding ring.  All right.  Why don't you go downstairs?  Should I bring Sam to get the video on the street?  Yeah.  Or is that too conspicuous, you think?  No, Sam just...  We'll see if the guy minds being in the video.  To document the whole thing. 
[02:42:00]  I would be amazed if someone comes up on the street.  If not, we got an intern.  Would you?  I'd be fucking amazed if they didn't.  Oh, my gosh.  Really?  Yeah.  I want to pee before this happens.  In a second.  Yeah, I got to pee, too, actually.  I have to pee before it happens.  Because if any cum comes out, then it hurts.  What?  If I haven't peed yet.  Do you have a jerk off and then pee, and it hurts?  Because the cum is like...  What happened?  Well, Sam was mentioning, yes, if we should bring Brie,  so that they can see what they're getting.  Or maybe we print out a picture or something.  No, I think we...  Bring the box down, because anything in front of the fucking building... 
[02:42:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  I got to try and take a shit.  Are you going to pee right now, Jimmy?  Can I come?  I'm going to go pee with Jimmy.  Everyone's peeing.  Me and Jimmy are going to go suck each other off just to...  Oh, God.  Does that work within your marriage, if you blow Jimmy?  Yeah, I can blow Jimmy.  Okay.  I did.  I hit it already.  Unbelievable.  This one?  I got to try and take a shit.  I forgot about that one.  I love that one.  Hey, Marc Maron, what are you thinking?  What are you thinking over there?  I'm thinking just how important porn has been in my life...  Yeah.  ...over the last 25 years.  Yeah.  You're like... 
[02:43:00]  You help out.  Yeah.  You really do.  Girls.  Big helper.  Fantastic.  I try.  He's having sex with a black sock these days.  Oh, that was once and I just didn't prepare.  What are you...  I don't know of any guy who hasn't scrapped into their sock at one point in their life.  I don't know what it's with guys that they can't just prepare.  Like, you know you're going to do it.  Bring a towel, washcloth, some Kleenex, what, you got to dig into the hamper like an ass?  Sometimes you're going for the quickie just to get it over with.  Like, you're surprising yourself.  Like, who knew I was going to do this?  Or someone's home, maybe? 
[02:43:30]  After I plowed through a pint of Ben and Jerry's.  What a pathetic night that was last night.  You fucked some Ben and Jerry's?  No, I didn't.  I ate the Ben and Jerry's?  I assumed you were fucking your ice cream.  I ate the Ben and Jerry's and that wasn't enough.  You know what I'm saying?  But I didn't go onto the computer.  I didn't use any of your services.  That's kind of girl-like.  I went with my mind.  Not insulting you, but that's kind of girl-like.  Like, your emotions taking it out by eating ice cream.  I'm not embarrassed about my feminine side.  I'm not wearing wigs or getting fake boobs.  I'm eating ice cream.  Is that so horrible?  No, I guess, you know.  But that's like kind of a girl thing. 
[02:44:00]  I sat all night and just ate ice cream.  I felt bad.  All right, so I have some food issues.  Is that going to be a problem?  No, not at all.  I still jerk off into a sock.  Does that count for anything?  That's more manly.  Okay, all right.  Anthony, people are confused.  They think this is our 9-11 tribute show.  It is.  It was.  It started that way and everything changed.  We're trying to make people forget.  I know the thing is never forget.  We want people to forget just for a little while.  Well, where can people see you guys, too?  Because Brie is a real, is a fucking, a trooper, man.  Both of them, man.  No, but I'm saying as a personality, I don't know her.  It kind of is because she didn't get fucked at 9 or 11. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  She was fucked at 12.  So it's kind of a tie-in.  Where's the expo?  It's in Edison?  Yes, it is in Edison, New Jersey.  It's the New Jersey Convention Center.  Because that faggot mayor in Secaucus didn't want the expo there.  Oh, my goodness, Will.  That fucking asshole.  Oh, my goodness.  You know why?  Because he looks at a girl like you and makes cumzies in his pants.  Instantly.  He just goes, he looks and goes, oh. 
[02:45:00]  And then he goes, I don't want them in my town because I make cumzies.  Well, I don't really have any opinion on that.  I'm sure he's a lovely man.  Oh, you should have a shit stain.  So how big is the expo?  What's going to be there?  Oh, my goodness.  It's huge.  There's going to be shows going on on the stage.  Would you love to hear that from her?  Oh, my goodness, it's huge.  Just that.  I would hear it.  I would hear it.  Well, we'll work with it.  We'll work with it.  Is that it?  But there's going to be a lot of huge stars there, too.  Gina Lynn's going to be there. 
[02:45:30]  Stormy, Daniels.  Sunny Lane, who I fucking love, man.  Sunny Lane.  Oh, do I like her.  Is Gage out of the business?  She's a real sweetie.  Gage?  She has a nice, fat name.  The little kid from Pet Sematary?  Yes, he got hit by a big black car.  His little shoe comes off.  That was mine!  Give me that back!  My shoe and my wig!  I tried to bring my wig back to life.  I feel like I'm out of the loop with professional porn. 
[02:46:00]  I find myself looking at all the amateur bullshit porn.  I've got to get up to speed.  That's my favorite kind, though.  I love amateur porn.  Five minutes of amateur porn is great.  I don't know who any of these people she's talking about.  I like classic.  I love the classic.  I love the scenario where it was on film.  Like when women had hair on the top.  Big fucking hairy back of the day.  Yeah, yeah.  Back of the day.  Hey, son.  Can you come here and help me with this plant?  Dad.  Where half of the time he's eating pussy is spent with those fingers pulling hair away. 
[02:46:30]  Like trying to find it.  And then you look at it and it's like roadkill.  It looks like fucking 13 day roast beef.  It just has that rainbow on it.  It's like fucking Reginald Denny's head.  When I was 14, I grew up in New Mexico and everybody, you got your driver's license when  you're 15 in Albuquerque.  So we all had fake IDs at 15 and we all had the same fucking name on the ID because the  guy who made them would come with a board that you'd hold in front of your head at a 
[02:47:00]  party, right?  It's the same fucking...  So it was all the same information.  And we go to this place called the Pyramid Theater, which was this porno theater.  We had four 15-year-old guys with all of us Tom Bynes.  That was the name Tom Bynes?  Yeah, Tom Bynes.  And I remember seeing the first porno I saw.  It must have been like...  I don't know when it was made in the mid-70s.  And all I know is it ended with a woman on a...  It had some sort of weird occult theme to it.  And some guy was on a bus and some woman picks him up and they go back to her apartment and  she takes her clothes off and she's got the face of the devil tattooed to where the pussy 
[02:47:30]  is the devil's mouth.  Nice.  And the guy's fucking her and she's going, fuck me.  Fuck Satan.  And I'm 15.  I'm like, is this how it goes?  Is this how...  Am I missing something?  Is this what I have to look forward to?  Who put the fucking History Channel on?  They're showing 9-11.  Put something else.  We said change the channel so they go to the History Channel.  I don't want to see the buildings.  Good odds that the History Channel would have something on this today.  It's called the History Channel.  Yeah.  I'm amazed that the post didn't do nothing on it.  That was amazing. 
[02:48:00]  That the post didn't have the cover story.  Putting a picture of a pig with lipstick on.  I like the old pornos, but some of the guys were...  There was a guy named Arbola who was a porn star.  He was in a lot of them.  And he looked like fucking Robert Duvall.  He was balding in his 40s.  I remember that guy.  He was the worst.  Who were the other ones?  Mark Wallace, Tom Byron?  Mark Wallace has the hiv.  He's done, right?  Is he?  Yeah.  He's got the virus.  Tom Byron I actually met.  He's got a gut now.  He was a big Tough Crowd fan.  He's got a fucking goatee.  Peter North looks the same.  He's still fucking shooting.  Really?  Like eight gallons of jizz. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, he's got a fucking...  Oh, that fucking intimidating cock he has.  Who's that guy that's a real evil guy?  Not...  What's a...  Max Hardcore.  Who's the guy?  His little hat and his little feet.  Hey!  Who's the dude that was in opening...  Looking for sports fans.  Opening of Misty Beethoven.  What was that guy's name?  Jeremy...  Oh, shit.  Did you ever see that movie?  Opening of Misty Beethoven?  Did you ever see the one...  I forget who it was.  Ginger Lynn, I think it was.  She was...  Her boyfriend...  Yes!  Her boyfriend was a comic.  And he was bombing at this hell gig.  She's in the back getting fucked and sucking dick by the other two guys while he's on there 
[02:49:00]  bombing.  And then he comes off and knocks on the door.  He's like, honey...  Like, you know, wants to talk about his set.  How bad it went.  And she goes, close your eyes.  I'm going to do that thing to you that you've always liked, but keep your eyes shut.  And the guy finishes on her ass and they sneak out right past him.  And then he goes in with his eyes closed and she's still got jizz on his ass.  That's my biggest fear in comedy.  I'm going to be up at the cellar one night bombing.  And your boyfriend will knock on the door. 
[02:49:30]  And then you'll open it.  You're losing the girls.  Yeah, I know, right?  She backed off from the mic.  You got to...  I'll fucking open.  Don't fucking blame me.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to add to the fucking show.  I'm telling you.  I was just thrown off by the Sesame Street a little bit.  Well, you know why?  Because 9-11 ain't going to be on Sesame Street.  Okay.  You can rest assured.  Watching the first time she was twice.  Yeah, when she was 12.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, where's Danny?  I thought he was going to be on the street.  He's supposed to be bringing the...  Where's Danny?  People up here.  You one of those stars that have like a boyfriend-husband thing? 
[02:50:00]  Because that's always odd to me.  No.  No?  No.  Oh, good girl.  What about you?  Do you have a boyfriend?  Why don't you talk to her?  I can't do it.  You can't do it?  What happens?  I can't have boyfriends.  It's impossible.  Really?  Why?  Do they get a little jealous?  It's not even a jealousy thing.  It's just...  Well, it's timing.  I mean, we work constantly, right?  Yeah.  Do you ever fuck a married guy?  Never, actually.  Unless a porn star.  I'm sure there's a couple married people.  But you never would like...  You never fucked like a legit married guy, like a square?  No.  Would you? 
[02:50:30]  It must be...  Imagine.  Could you go out with a porn star, though?  I mean...  It's a fucking fuck yes.  My buddy used to go out with a dominatrix, and they'd be out to dinner, and her page  would go off, and she'd go, oh, I gotta go piss on this banker's head.  Good.  Hilarious.  How great is that?  It's hilarious.  I'll be back in an hour.  Fucking banker.  Jesus.  I'd buy her the Fiji water.  Would you?  Fuck yeah.  I would.  I dated a girl who did some porn in L.A.  It didn't bother me at all.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  It's kind of like cuckold, though, isn't it?  No, not a... 
[02:51:00]  Thank you.  No, I don't...  Go down to the set and watch her work?  No, I didn't.  Hey, look, that's my girl sucking that dick.  No, no, no.  That ain't mine.  That's better than like, yeah, okay, I'll watch the kid.  I'll see you when you come back.  Yeah, that's true.  It didn't bother me.  We had very tender, nice sex.  Did you?  Yeah.  That's what she said?  No, I was.  We were kissing and loving.  What kind of sex do you like having in your personal life?  It really just depends on the mood.  I like it all.  I would talk dirty.  I would say some sexy stuff like, take that dick.  It seems like you'd want something a little different than what you do at work. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, that's true.  And that's the case most of the time.  But sometimes, you know, still.  Can I ask some novice questions?  Because I'm like new to this game here.  The wee-wee goes in her wee-wee.  Okay, so that's how it starts?  Yes.  When you do movies, do you come for real?  Yes.  I'm very, very sensitive.  Oh, yeah, every time.  Seriously?  Seriously.  Seriously.  I didn't at first.  It was hard at first because there's like, you know, 15 people watching you.  Right.  But then you just kind of get in the zone, the come zone?  Yeah, I get to the point where I don't notice. 
[02:52:00]  I've had them leave and come back and I didn't know.  It just...  Wow.  My penis would wilt under that pressure.  Horribly.  I'm just happy to know that they do.  Her face.  She's right.  Hey, let's see...  We've got Danny on the street.  Let's see if he's had any luck.  Hey, Danny, what's going on?  That's a damn good point.  Not much, man.  You know, I could never in a million years imagine it was this hard to pick a guy off.  Of course it is.  Come get laid by a gorgeous porn star. 
[02:52:30]  They don't believe it.  I'm really trying to sell this.  And people think it's up there.  They don't believe it.  We're meeting and I'm whipping out her picture.  I'm like, this girl is upstairs right now.  and you could totally  Danny  Danny  can you tuck your hair  into your hat  yeah maybe  maybe it's you  that's  you look like a guy  who just got kicked  out of clown college  you have Gallagher  trying to sell pussy  on the streets  yeah I wouldn't come up  with him either  who would  I think  you want to fuck  a porn star  he just committed  a sodomy  no  she's dead  yeah you gotta send

[03:05:00]  of her  spanking her  but apparently  it's a fake  penis  it's very  shiny  it's too  shiny  it's not  going all  the way  in  and the  base  is too  shiny  you should  not be  able to  see yourself  in a  cock  it's too  shiny  you've got a  great fuck ass  though  what a perfect  ass  that is just  a great  fucking  going on  I like the way  her neck  is bent  all the way  back  his big  dumb  shiny  fake  plastic  penis  ain't even  real  look at the  fucking  how perfect  that ass  is  it's Keith  Robinson  god damn it

[03:06:00]  describe it  how mad  was that  guy that  he had to  put a  fake dick  in your  mouth  while he's  naked  how embarrassing  is that  oh yeah  look at this  oh I gotta see  the cum bath  this is  watch it  squirt out  what is it  what do they  use  it's like  a pina colada  mix  it's a  crispy cream  machine  that is so  fucking  impossible  you know  jesus  look at how  this is coming  out  it's ridiculous  now we know  what's it called  cum bath  yeah  wait the guy  left the room  the dick is still  cumming  it's like the  fucking  this is just  silly 
[03:06:30]  it's like the  vomit scene  in the fucking  uh  yeah  monic python  yeah  no  I was thinking  the other one  no I was thinking  um  uh  uh  fuck  is that sugar  no  uh  the puppets  like pina colada  mix  oh um  um  yeah  team america  you guys would be surprised on how many people email me and say hey I seen you on this site is that really real and you know people ask all the time  that's crazy  how many of the guys you gotta dream those people that guy would if that was real he would get a girl pregnant every time he fucked 
[03:07:00]  just shooting it up into a pregnant and then give her an abortion immediately after  fucking 13 twins stuck together  we're getting away from the crush thing and I can't let this uh go and and brie did you  why don't you eat your fucking yogurt now I'll be  yeah  yeah  yeah  very funny  I could be funny  uh brie uh also said earlier that you're available and looking right  uh oh remember the last time that happened 
[03:07:30]  she said she's available  yikes  and we just brushed by that  and we're also finding out that she has a crush on someone in this room  mm-hmm  nothing  what's wrong Danny  all right  Danny  people are gay  they don't want to get laid  maybe they're just going to work  nobody wants to get laid  that's okay I'd rather fuck my crush anyways so  oh  oh wow  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  motherfucker  no you didn't  who the fuck  eeny meeny miny mo  oh shit  oh shit  nigga please  somebody in this room 
[03:08:00]  eeny meeny miny mo  yes  I love Danny saying that everyone's gay  well maybe they have morals  or maybe they're just going to work  maybe they weren't anticipating  yeah but that's what I'm saying  like some guys are like  oh I gotta go to a meeting  I'm just like what fucking meeting is more important than this  yeah why not lose your job for this  the best part about Danny down there was  every time somebody said no  as they were walking away  while they were clearly still in earshot  Danny said  they said no  it must be gay or something 
[03:08:30]  and homo said no  of course  you gotta crush on Sam  no that's obvious  no it was someone that was in the room already  I guess  Sam was in the room  yeah but no no  it was in the room at that moment  at that moment  so I don't think it's Sam  Danny  Danny wasn't in the room  you gotta crush on Danny  and she keeps looking at the publicist  like I'm gonna kill you  maybe this is how we get something going  maybe you're like really shy  and you would have never 
[03:09:00]  you know done anything with this crush  um you're probably right  that is so weird  can we just speed the crush up  it's like everyone's  everyone's holding their lottery tickets  but they're not giving the numbers out  nobody wants to open the Wonka bar  and look for the golden ticket  yeah cause even fucking  grandpa has bed sores  a bunch of guys  are just gonna be sitting here  with chocolate bars  and one is gonna be  you did it Charlie  balls deep  wow

[03:13:00]  older man  alright we still gotta make a video  her videos  well I think we can still get  the businessman thing done  but she'd have to probably  come out with us  cause no one's buying our gag  really  no one's buying it  really  well now that she has  a crush on Jimmy  I don't even know  if I can you know  do that  why Jimmy's open minded  guy she's open minded  she's gonna quit the business  cause she likes Jimmy  a little bit  they've known each other too  a little more than  anybody else in here  what do you like about Jimmy 
[03:13:30]  we could talk  we already know  speak openly  speak openly  your publicist already said  when you were in the bathroom  that it's Jimmy  so  oh my god  she ratted you out in a second  the second that door shut  she went  it's all over  I believe it too  I knew I shouldn't have  left the room  but I had to go so bad  yeah  what do you like about Jimmy  still can't look at you  by the way Jimmy  oh that's so cute  how cool is this  puppy love  puppy love  wow  no it's probably that  everyone is so wrong 
[03:14:00]  and she doesn't want to  look at my dumb face  I'm like really  Jimmy always thinking  that it can't be true  I love it  I don't make assumptions  about people  you could be balls deep  in her dude  like right now  what  you know what  okay  I've liked Jimmy  since I met him  and a little story  that me and him  were just talking about  on the way here  was that  I said  Jimmy  why haven't you  been calling me  you know  I had given you  my number  because they wanted  you know  to do something  and so it's really 
[03:14:30]  because he's a dumb fuck  it's in Jimmy's hands  right now  it's in Jimmy's hands  right now  it's like  three and I  have communicated  but she's like  the reality is  she lives far  shut up  where does she live  there are planes  there are airplanes  dude  she lives far  dude  you fly places  to fuck her  I don't think  it's like  she's working  it's not for any  bad reasons  she's working  leave the show  are you insane  we're at  sunglass hut  now  go brie  do you want to  get some coffee  what are you waiting  for  that would be

[03:17:30]  your cheeks  are more  sensitive  you can tell  it's true  I read about  that  yeah the cheek  test  you have most  because your  hands are rough  because you  touch things  the cock  though really  has more  nerve endings  the cock test  is the best  do the cock  test  do you understand  right now  there's all  these people  in the room  I would be  very very  my cock right  now would be  very dysfunctional  I understand  nobody wants  to see a cock  I'm saying  bad job raising  children  dysfunctional  no  are you disappointed 
[03:18:00]  by the reaction  of Jimmy  no I totally  understand  because he's  such a cutie  and I think  that we should  do our thing  outside of  the studio  if he ever  does call  if he ever  does call  we got Kelly  oh you  faggot  no I'm not  a faggot  oh you're  such a faggot  we did talk  we email  she's asking  you to call  our dunce  my shit  yellow treats  at AOL
