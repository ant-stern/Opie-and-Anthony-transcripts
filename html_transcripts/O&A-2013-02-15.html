<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of the recent meteor strike in Russia, focusing on the dramatic dashcam footage and the surprisingly limited damage.  They speculated about the meteor's composition and trajectory, comparing the event to a science fiction movie, using humorous and often crude commentary.  The conversation then transitioned to the Carnival Triumph cruise ship disaster, detailing the passengers’ horrific experiences with sewage problems, food shortages (eventually alleviated by helicoptered-in lobster), and the lack of power and communication.  The hosts played news clips, mocked the media’s coverage, speculated about passenger behavior (including theft and hygiene issues), and discussed the legal and logistical ramifications of the event.

The show's irreverent tone continued with a discussion of a sewage problem on a cruise ship, employing vulgar language and comparisons to female bodily functions.  They then announced upcoming guests: "Stalker Patty" (getting married to Fez from Ron and Fez), Ben Lyons, and Modest Yahoo.  The hosts' discussion included a mention of DJ Whoo Kid's "N-word Bond" tour and the use of racial slurs.  Joe Piscopo called in for a brief, somewhat awkward conversation.  A caller's unexpected and audible erection provided further crude humor.

A "Chicago Day" segment featured Chicago songs and a vulgar debate on their musical merit. The broadcast then returned to the meteor, shifting to a discussion on the prevalence of Russian dashcams, showing clips of traffic accidents and staged insurance scams, all punctuated by crude and offensive language.  Stalker Patty then called in, engaging in a lengthy, vulgar, and disrespectful conversation with the hosts about her upcoming wedding to Fez, her finances, and her failure to confirm her studio appearance.  Sexually suggestive and demeaning comments about Patty's appearance and sexual expectations were frequent.  A brief "Black History Month" segment, featuring racist and offensive language, highlighted the invention of the mailbox by an African-American inventor, interrupting the Patty interview.

A separate call with Patty featured a highly sexually explicit discussion with the hosts and a male caller, focusing on graphic details of anticipated sexual acts with her fiancé, Fez, a gay virgin. Patty expressed discomfort and reluctance, leading to relentless teasing and berating from the hosts for her perceived lack of sexual adventurousness.

Later, movie critic Ben Lyons joined the show in studio, offering his opinions on the Oscars, including his predictions for Best Picture (*Argo*), positive review of *Django Unchained*, and criticisms of *Silver Linings Playbook* and *Lincoln*.  Modest Yahoo was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

Finally, musician Matisyahu appeared as a guest, discussing his religious conversion, his experiences with the Orthodox Jewish community,  his time traveling and selling glass pipes before his conversion, and his eventual departure from the community. He recounted his experiences in Israel, including a humorous anecdote about jumping from a moving taxi, and discussed his current life with his wife and children.  He performed two songs, "Crossroads" and "Live Like a Warrior," live in the studio.  The hosts mentioned their own upcoming appearances throughout the interview and performances.  Throughout the show, references were made to Mars (presumably a sound technician), Sam Roberts, Larry King, 50 Cent, and Mike Tyson, likely in relation to previously played audio or musical segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme.  Oh my God.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, this is insane.  So, flagellant.

[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this bitch.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Well thank you Larry King.  Thank you 50 cents.  Plava.  And thank you Mike Tyson for that amazing song that Troy Kwan and the gang put together.  Good morning.  It's Friday.  On the Opie Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  We got lots to do man.  We should jump right into this.  Oh yeah.  A fucking meteor hit Russia four hours ago.  What?  Four maybe five hours at this point.  In Russia meteor hit you.  Wait till you see the videos.  Yeah.  There's a whole bunch of them because Russia loves their dash cams.  They love cams everywhere by the way.  Oh is it everywhere?  Yeah.  Dash cams.  Security cams everywhere.  Are they GoPro people?  Yeah.  They look like pretty high quality.  They look like GoPro cameras.  I think it's GoPro but the P is backwards. 
[00:03:00]  Sure.  Right.  And the G has all sorts of growths on it.  Yeah.  Things.  There's dots and slashes.  I don't understand.  I don't understand.  Sure.  My mind would blow up.  Try to learn Russian at our age.  No.  But if you throw a kid into a Russian class.  Yeah.  He would fucking pick it up like it's nothing.  How does that work?  I don't know.  Their brains are all spongy still.  U-S-S-R translate to C-C-C-P. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  It doesn't make any sense.  Are we putting the videos up on our Facebook page Hopi and Anthony?  We will be.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  I know when we say shit like that our audience are like alright what's the gag today.  But you'll see for yourself the videos are going to be everywhere today.  Yeah it did.  Pretty cool.  The one flying across the fucking highway.  Yeah.  As the guy is in a deep long fucking turn to the right.  And that is some science fiction movie out of space shit. 
[00:04:00]  It looks like the opening to a sci-fi movie.  You're right.  Just this giant plume of smoke.  This real bright ball at the end of it.  Yeah.  Just going across the sky.  Right.  And then some of the other cameras inside the security cameras.  They show the windows busting in.  Mm-hmm.  People getting I guess there were 400 people injured by flying glass for the most part.  So what?  The head of town or something?  No I think it's just the shock wave of it entering the atmosphere. 
[00:04:30]  That sonic boom.  Really?  And then when it comes apart.  Right.  In the atmosphere it makes a shock wave that blasted windows in.  Do you get hit with pebbles?  I think you got more glass than pebbles.  But what happens to the meteor?  I think it just for the most part burns up.  So it burns up before it even hits the ground?  In the atmosphere.  Or most of it?  Yeah.  Parts did hit the ground but I think it would be very rare to actually get hit by it.  Right.  But it's that initial boom.  Holy.  That shock wave. 
[00:05:00]  What is that explosion right there?  Like you see the burst of light.  No that's the sun.  That is the sun hitting it?  Was it?  Or was that it coming apart?  I don't know.  Well go back.  I'm sorry.  They showed quite a few like that.  When it comes in the atmosphere and just brightens up.  Wait.  Was that it entering the atmosphere?  You can see how bright it gets.  Okay.  Look how bright it gets.  Look how bright it gets.  Yeah man.  That's like some J.J. Abrams shit right there.  Crazy right?  But that's it hitting the atmosphere and breaking apart?  And busting up and...  Looks like it I guess.  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  It's hot.  Mm-hmm.  Coming through. 
[00:05:30]  It just burns up and explodes.  It looked lower than that.  It looked like it was too low to be coming into the atmosphere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It almost looks like a plane.  Yeah.  Look at that.  The height of a plane.  An airliner.  That's amazing.  I want to kiss Mars on the mouth.  Aww.  I really do.  Not in a gay way.  Being a broadcaster, it's all about the microphone and it's all about how you can hear yourself.  Yeah.  I've been bitching about this fucking microphone for years and no one would hear me out.  What do you mean?  You've been like cool?  No.  You said you were bitching. 
[00:06:00]  I wish I was cool.  Oh!  I thought you meant you were bitching.  If I was cool, I would have never went into radio.  Cool!  I would have never went into radio.  But I've been bitching about this microphone for years but I couldn't really explain.  But every time I go on your mic or Jimmy's mic when Sam's running the ship or whatever  the fuck, it always sounded way better.  Mm-hmm.  Mars finally figured it out.  I hear it.  I hear it right now.  Holy fuck!  This is how it was meant to be.  You got some volume.  Although the other day, that doesn't excuse him from fucking up everything the other day. 
[00:06:30]  I know.  But he was trying.  He destroyed one entire program.  Who did it?  Mars.  Mars.  Because we started the show and he was fiddling.  You were fiddling.  Remember when we were fiddling about?  No one he was fiddling.  Fiddling about.  But this mic sounds amazing.  See I bitch a lot so I also want to give compliments.  I'm learning that.  There you go.  Amazing.  I'm very happy.  Thank you.  Now there's the quality of the sound.  Now we just got to get the quality of what's going in the microphones.  Yeah, the content.  I hope we can figure that out. 
[00:07:00]  That's the big part.  So what do we do with this meteor, man?  We can't talk to the people.  Because they're all the way over there.  And they don't even speak.  And we're over here.  Ah.  It was attracted to the magnetic trains.  And what happened, Yakov?  There's a compilation video.  There's so many videos up already.  Yeah.  They love their dash cams.  Is there no impact crater at all?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  I think this fucking thing just exploded.  What was that?  They really figured it out.  Whoever fucking built this planet really figured that shit out. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, let's put an atmosphere around it.  You know?  And that way, whatever tries to come in and smash into the planet  and make it look like all the other planets without atmospheres  with craters all over the place.  Right.  That'll just burn it up.  Like they figured all that shit out.  Do other planets have atmospheres?  Not like Earth, no.  No.  When you have a dense atmosphere like Earth,  where something is doing 25,000 miles an hour  and then it hits the air,  the actual friction just of the air hitting that meteor 
[00:08:00]  just busted apart.  It's amazing.  That proves there's a god then.  You would think, right?  Well, if we're the only one with an atmosphere in the area.  The same shit that we breathe  protects us from these fucking flying monsters from space.  It's a flying monster.  It's a flying flaming monster from space.  The ones that do impact our motherfuckers, though.  Oh, huge.  Huge.  But the size of Texas.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Whoa.  It's heading right for New York City. 
[00:08:30]  It only gets amazing.  Well, the news got pissed off the other day,  because, what, there's another...  This isn't the meteor they were talking about that's...  Oh, that's an asteroid.  That's asteroid.  No.  And they, you know, they went to a science guy on...  I want to say it's CNN, which is becoming a strange joke.  An asteroid, by the way...  Yeah, what's the difference between an asteroid and a meteor?  An asteroid becomes a meteor when it enters the atmosphere.  A meteor...  So they're all asteroids?  Yeah, they all start out as asteroids, 
[00:09:00]  but the second it enters the atmosphere, it becomes a meteor.  But why can't we just call them all asteroids and just say,  yeah, this asteroid went all the way and hit Earth?  I think that...  Well, they want to distinguish the ones that are just in orbit and passing.  Like, an asteroid will pass the Earth...  Right.  ...and whip around because of the gravitational pull  and then just fly the other way again.  Sure.  But a meteor is an asteroid that enters the atmosphere.  Gotcha.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And then after that...  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, it was an asteroid until it...  I learned something every day I had no idea.  Yes. 
[00:09:30]  I did pretty well in science, too.  Pretty amazing.  Anyway, they had a scientist,  and he basically said that asteroid is not going to hit Earth  because, you know, the news is playing with it like,  oh, boy, will this one hit Earth?  Because it's a giant one.  Isn't that one like a couple football fields or something like that?  Yeah, that one's about that size.  It's supposed to enter...  It's supposed to go within the orbit of some of our satellites.  Right.  It could endanger some of the telecommunication satellites.  But they were talking to a scientist, and he goes,  you know what?  We've been tracking this thing for a year,  and we've known for a year that it's not hitting Earth.  Yeah.  And you could see the news guy like,  thanks a lot. 
[00:10:00]  Stop it.  We're trying to scare people here.  Right.  We're trying to scare people so they'll watch longer.  He was so casual about it like,  nah, we've known about this thing.  We're just watching it.  Yeah.  It's a hobby for us.  It's kind of cool and all.  Yeah.  And it might fuck with a couple satellites,  but that's about it.  How bad would that one be if it hit?  Oh, boy.  I don't think that would end life,  but that's a big one.  That is a big one.  That could do some fucking damage.  That would impact.  Yeah.  That wouldn't just break up.  That one would fucking...  It depends on the angle it comes in, too.  If it comes in on a shallow angle, 
[00:10:30]  it's got to go through more atmosphere  before it actually gets to the Earth,  so it would burn up a lot more.  If it comes on a very steep angle,  like 90 degrees to the Earth,  then it's coming through,  and it doesn't go through as much atmosphere,  so it doesn't have as much time to burn up.  And that's when you get...  The big craters.  Yeah, that's when you get that.  Nice.  Like the great meteor crater in Arizona.  Very cool.  The Yucatan,  right off the Yucatan Peninsula.  That whole gulf in there  is supposedly an impact point of a meteor. 
[00:11:00]  That's wild.  So, yeah, we got a meteor that hit Russia.  The videos are pretty damn cool.  Imagine if you get a plane and seeing that.  Imagine if you're flying in a fucking plane  and you see that thing coming across.  Oh, man.  That would be creepy shit.  No, thank you.  If we get any updates, we'll let you know,  but so far, 400 injured by...  What you're saying?  The vibrations, mostly?  Mostly flying glass from the shock wave of it coming in.  No kidding.  Yeah.  I'm sure there'll be a few deaths.  Maybe.  Those Russians are fucking...  They're pretty hardy people, though.  They're pretty tough.  They're tough. 
[00:11:30]  They're just...  Some glass in my face.  What is that?  And you're reminded by seeing these videos how awful of a place it is.  It just looks so fucking cold there.  Everything looks like it did in the 60s.  It just looks dry and cold.  Yeah.  Dreary.  What a dreary place.  Look, it's just...  There's a compilation video, so there's a whole bunch of different ones, obviously,  and...  Terrible.  It just looks like a horrendously cold place.  Ugh.  The highway looks like it's ice with that shine on it. 
[00:12:00]  At least the strippers will have more to talk about while they fucking take your money.  Did you see the media about this?  Where my family is from?  Shut up and dance.  Shut up and dance.  You should try to get more money.  Like, yeah, my family's windows need to be replaced.  My family windows they broke?  Maybe you could pay with dance?  Shut it.  Yahuwah.  Come here.  Ohhhh.  This mic rules.  Ohhhh.  Anyway, um... 
[00:12:30]  I must break you.  The cruise ship is finally back in port.  Yes, it did dock there in Mobile, Alabama last night.  All the news crews were there.  Well, CNN especially, they basically said there's nothing else happening in the world.  Don't you people worry about anything else.  Right.  We need to cover the dumb cruise ship coming into Mobile, Alabama.  Yeah.  They spent, I think it was eight straight hours, barely doing any other news, as this thing 
[00:13:00]  was just chugging along at what, six to seven knots?  Limping its way into a port.  Limping its port.  Yeah.  And then the tow rope broke.  Oh, did it?  I didn't see that part.  Oh, yeah.  The tow rope...  And I have a conspiracy ready.  I'm not a conspiracy guy.  Ooh.  Well, let's hear it.  Well, if you're a carnival cruiser, right?  Yeah.  And you got this fucking, this shit boat making its way to Mobile, Alabama.  The shit boat!  And you got the news crews waiting, right? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  When did you break the tow rope to make sure it docks a little later at night?  A little later, when people are sleeping, so they can't watch the news and see how shitty  it was.  E-Rock was watching the coverage.  I had to give up.  When did that dumb thing hit Mobile?  Around 11?  11.30?  Yeah.  Around 11 o'clock it finally kicked in.  And the tow rope broke, which threw a couple of extra hours on the whole process.  And I'm like, man, I think that CEO said, fucking break that fucking tow rope.  Bust the tow rope. 
[00:14:00]  We don't want this coming in during prime time.  They're showing it on the news over here.  I'm watching...  We got clips.  And what they're showing is a lot of passengers coming off the boat, interviewing with the  news, and they're smiling, they're laughing, they're talking about, you know, it wasn't  fun, it wasn't a cruise.  Right.  But they made doo-doo.  Right.  They made doo-doo.  They had fun in some way, shape, or form.  And the news was so fucking pissed off that they didn't have crying, horrifically disappointed 
[00:14:30]  and sad passengers.  When I was watching, I think it was Wolf Blitzer, because the people from the ship were getting  their phones charged.  What was the Situation Room?  It was in the Situation Room.  And they were getting their cell phones charged, so then they're finally making phone calls  to the media, and Wolf Blitzer got one on.  Oh, man.  And he describes, like, there's sewage in the hallway, you know, sloshing around.  Sloshing.  A lot of sloshing.  People are eating onion sandwiches and this and that, right?  And the smell, and he gets a guy on, and the guy's like, well, Wolf, to tell you the 
[00:15:00]  truth, you know, it's not that bad.  We're making do, and everyone's been cooperating and working together.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  And you could see it in his eyes, like he wants to fire a producer for getting the wrong  person.  He got someone that completely could, you know, handle the situation.  Iraq?  I think that was the guy who said, yeah, I just had a crab sandwich and some lobster.  Yes!  They opened up the dining room because they needed to get rid of all the extra food.  Yes, they had dropped off a bunch of food.  So people were eating fine, and Wolf's just kind of staring at the camera.  Fuck.  Wait, were they feeding that food the whole time?  No. 
[00:15:30]  No, I think they held on to some stuff.  They were trying to save their food.  They helicoptered in some food a few days ago, I guess.  A couple days.  A couple of days ago.  Well, when it got down to where they were handing out onion sandwiches, when they knew  they had lobster and fucking crab sandwiches ready to go.  Why were they not handing that stuff out?  I don't know.  They had a helicoptered in.  Oh.  That's why they had that tent city.  Wait, they had lobster helicoptered in?  Helicoptered in, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, they were trying to make sure these people were treated well so they don't sue.  Yeah, the tent city going on.  You signed a contract. 
[00:16:00]  No, I know.  I was going to say that as my...  A tent city was on the deck, and then they had to clear all the tents up.  People were making them out of the sheets from their beds and whatnot, and setting up  this little encampment area on the deck of the ship.  Yeah.  The main deck.  And I guess the helicopter had to come in, so they had everyone clear their sheets.  So they could deliver the lobster off.  Deliver the lobster and all the good food.  And yeah, people were eating fine.  Yeah, you sign your life away when you go on a cruise ship, but I don't know.  And there's maritime law, too, that says that there's certain things you can sue for and 
[00:16:30]  you can't when you're at sea.  But...  Yeah, it's weird.  Fucking...  Somebody will find a loophole.  Yeah, in some...  You can't have a cruise ship going 500 miles off course and then slowly bring it back into  port.  It took, what, five days, four days to bring it back in?  And the ships aren't flagged out of the United States, either.  So you've got to deal with international laws.  Somebody will figure it out.  It's very difficult to sue these.  Yeah, carnival's out of the Bahamas.  Yeah.  Are they?  Yeah.  Is that why, you think? 
[00:17:00]  I don't think any cruise line is in the United States.  No, no.  The last one was...  Like, Royal Caribbean's out of Norway.  I think some ship that used to go to Hawaii or something was the last one out of the United  States.  Oh, we're not in that business in the United States?  No flagged ships out of the United States.  No kidding.  It's too expensive, tax-wise.  We can't...  It's too expensive with the litigation.  CNN loved pointing out that these people weren't, the people that work on the ships  don't have hourly pay, don't have unions, don't have all this stuff, because they're  not in the United States, and that's why the cruise lines don't base their headquarters 
[00:17:30]  in the United States.  Yeah, you know what it would cost?  Oh, I see.  A ticket would be a lot more fucking money if it was based in the U.S.  That's how fucked up this country has gotten, by the way.  We really have fucked up everything.  You know, we've sent jobs overseas.  We've got to bring it back to America.  Like, you know what?  The bottom line is making money.  That's what companies want to do.  Yeah.  And if it takes going overseas to do it because America's gotten so fucking greedy...  Yeah, there it is.  I say bring back the sweatshops, man.  Exactly.  There's people that'll take those jobs.  Love a good sweatshop.  Yeah.  Good Indonesian child workplace. 
[00:18:00]  Exactly.  Iraq, you saw the coverage?  Well, early on with the people getting paid, CNN kept saying, like, these people don't  make a lot of money, they work all these hours, they barely have a day off.  But then later on, they had reports that these people work on these ships maybe 10 years,  go back to their home countries, and they're the equivalent of millionaires.  Ah, they live like kings.  Yeah.  They make a ton of money from tips and everything else that they get.  Working for 10 years straight, they retire and they're done.  I love how we protest and try to shut down these factories and all these places that  these third world nations set up for people to work in. 
[00:18:30]  You know, they're not making the wages people make here in America.  Sorry.  But that's the way of the world.  And this is the only way they have to support themselves at all.  And then these dumb Americans sit there and go, we have to shut that place down.  Now you're killing the people.  Sure.  You know, they're not making a lot of money, but it doesn't cost a lot of money to live where  they're living.  Yeah, they don't mind.  No.  And on the ships, they're not paying board.  They're not paying food.  They got to work really hard, but they're taking all that money that they get and they 
[00:19:00]  send it back home.  Yeah, it doesn't go toward any real bills.  No.  We got some clips.  Instead of you trying to figure it out, watching a million news channels, we got all  the good clips right here for everybody.  Oh, we're your shitty cruise ship station.  That's right.  But, Iraq, how was it when the boat finally docked?  I wanted to stay up for it, but...  I kind of was passing out right as the boat was coming in.  Yeah.  Because it was just going on too late.  They showed a lot of people coming off the boat.  There was a big, like, cheer that went off.  Everyone was like, woo!  And you see people coming down the gangway. 
[00:19:30]  Apparently, they were all in robes.  Right.  And they were speculating that it was cold in Mobile that night.  And I'm just thinking that people figured they would take everything.  Like, take the fucking ride.  That's a nice robe.  Fuck it, I'm taking the robe.  I'm taking the towels.  I'm taking the...  Or they got shit pants on.  Do you think they had their shit pants?  They had their duty stains on the back of their clothes.  They must have stunk four days without a shower.  No brushing your teeth.  Nothing.  Just walking around in shit.  What do you think the cruise line will do for these people?  Nothing. 
[00:20:00]  $500 cash.  They're doing dumb shit.  They said $500 cash.  20% off of the next cruise.  Of the next cruise.  20 plus.  Plus the travel to go home.  Plus any related travel expenses.  Plus they paid for this cruise, right?  They gave me their money back.  They gave me their money back.  No they didn't.  What fucking cunts?  No they didn't.  I thought they did.  I thought I said...  I don't know, Ann.  I didn't hear they gave them a refund.  They have to.  I think they stepped up and they...  Not as far as yesterday goes, they were not paying for this cruise.  I think I heard that. 
[00:20:30]  I think I heard they paid for the cruise and their expenses and how they're going to get home and $500 and 20% off on the next cruise.  That must have been something new.  I think.  If they came up yesterday, they were not paying for the entire cruise.  Wouldn't that be a disastrous bit of fucking PR if they didn't pay for that?  They're Puerto Ricans.  Yes.  Oh.  Well, the disaster PR is the fact that we all know that that ship was filled with shit.  Some people might have liked it.  You know what I mean?  Imagine if it was a scat lovers cruise. 
[00:21:00]  They loved it.  This is the greatest weekend.  I'm going on another one of these.  Some shit fan actually went and started the fire.  Because he wanted his wife to have to shit in his face.  They were also having a problem, too, because in the afternoon, especially when the tow rope broke, they wanted to speak to a carnival representative.  They wanted the CEO.  They sent the senior vice president of marketing.  Oh, boy.  So he was the guy speaking, and the CEO didn't start speaking until...  Real late.  Yeah, real late.  The clip that CNN keeps showing over and over, that's when he finally showed up. 
[00:21:30]  And I think that was...  I was still up.  I think it was 8, 8.30 at night he finally showed his face.  All day, and the previous days, no word from him.  Yeah.  And he'd send other people from the company to speak instead of him.  So was it a...  Who was it?  The Scott Greenstein.  The Steve Blatter.  The Radio Wizard.  Like, who in comparison to here was it?  I don't know the other speakers they sent out, but I know yesterday they had the guy in charge of marketing was speaking.  And they're like, where's the CEO?  And he didn't show up.  Oh, wow.  So that's like who? 
[00:22:00]  Is that like Rob Cross?  No.  Rob Cross is still an intern.  Did they bring Rob Cross out to talk?  No.  It would have been the person who doesn't put us in the circulars and all the commercials.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  That's the equivalent?  Yeah.  So it wasn't even middle management, really.  Wow.  Management that has nothing to do with directly dealing with us.  Did you find out what these people get, Sam Roberts?  Yeah, I think they do.  I think you were right.  They do get a refund.  Oh.  And then...  The trip's paid for.  Wow.  80% off and 500 bucks.  The 20% off is a joke because most of these people will not do another cruise anytime soon. 
[00:22:30]  Especially not with Sam.  Some will, obviously.  Not with Carnival.  I bet you less than 20% will actually go on another cruise in the near future.  For the next couple of years.  Look, look.  The people there, like...  They're smiling.  Yeah.  They're off the boat.  They're like, uh...  Yay!  You know what?  They have a great little adventure story they're gonna tell over and over again to family  and friends.  That's a cruise you wanna hear about.  Yes!  Like, you don't give a fuck how was your cruise?  Oh, it was great!  We danced!  We ate the bucket!  Good food! 
[00:23:00]  Plenty of it!  Good friends!  Yes!  We made good friends!  Would you have handled it?  Yeah.  It would have been, you know, kinda hard at times, but...  Like, when I was down in the Outer Banks and that hurricane was coming, me and my brother  wanted to stay.  Badly.  Because it's different.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You're experiencing something.  I would've kinda had a good time with that.  Not for five days, man.  I'm fucking a comfort...  Five days would've been a little rough, huh?  Comfort lover.  I wanna plug shit in.  Right, right.  I want my AC.  All I would've been doing is just my...  My OCD would've been just kicking in, going, my fucking vacation's ruined! 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I would've had a meltdown.  And you had to wait hours for anything.  Right.  Three and a half hours just to eat.  That would've been the thing that got me in the house.  So, basically...  I hate waiting.  That means, basically, you eat, and then get back online.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For your next meal.  Yeah.  Because they're in, you know, wherever they were.  Right.  And then they get to Mobile, and as they're getting closer...  It's getting colder.  It's freezing cold, so all they did, they handed out some robes to me.  Mobile, Alabama?  Mobile.  Mobile.  It's called Mobile.  I don't know why.  It's not Mobile. 
[00:24:00]  It's not Mobile.  Anyone?  Could they have done anything better for them, or no?  Is that it?  I don't know.  They don't want to?  No, no, no.  On the sea.  On the ocean.  They agreed well, as best as they could, you know, accommodate these people.  They said that the crew did, like, an amazing job at trying to do the best that they could  possibly do.  No one had complaints about the crew.  It was, you know, it was a fucking mechanical problem.  A fire, yeah.  A fire is one thing.  People can understand a fire.  Yeah.  Fire.  You think the crew had a generator somewhere in the ship, and were living large? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  I think they delivered a generator, too, with the food.  They dropped in some power.  The problem is, with this whole thing, they took way too long to kind of react to the  situation.  Yeah, it seemed that way.  The food they only helicoptered in a couple days ago.  Yeah.  I mean, why weren't they right on it, right away?  I don't know.  Why was the ship allowed to go 500 miles off course?  That's a lot of fucking miles.  Could they have gotten them into a closer port on another ship, or is there anything they  could have done that they just didn't do to save money? 
[00:25:00]  I think that was the closest port.  No.  When it first hit, they were going to send them to another port, to answer your question,  but then the boat started floating away from that port, making it harder.  I think they were trying to.  So then they decided on mobile.  They were trying to fix it while it was drifting.  And hoping that the media wouldn't find out.  Oops.  Look at this.  Everyone's smiling and laughing.  Oh, they were all in their robes, clapping and having a good time.  Yeah.  Look at them.  They were hoping.  They have bed sheets with little signs written on them, draped over the side of the ship. 
[00:25:30]  They're having a pisser.  And a shitter.  How many of those bars do you think are still intact?  Oh, man.  Right.  I think they broke into everything.  I think they did.  Yeah, they just broke it.  Did they start breaking into shit?  Booze and foot.  Yeah, I'm sure it was fucking like anarchy.  I would love to take a tour of the ship.  Look at that.  They're showing bedding out in the hallways.  Mm-hmm.  Tensity.  The toilets were overflowing in the rooms, so the rooms themselves were really stinking 
[00:26:00]  and people were going out into the hallway.  All those mattresses that they're showing were stained some of the shit.  How the fuck are they going to clean that?  I mean, that shit is going to go into every nook and cranny.  They got to clean that shit up.  How?  I don't know.  Going to have to rip up every carpet.  Bring in the wolf.  Bring in the wolf.  Now sop up all those pieces of shit and piss.  You know, it doesn't have to be perfect, but...  Why don't we play some clips?  We've got the Carnival CEO.  He finally talked pretty late yesterday. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  In the day.  First, let me say just how thankful and relieved I am to see the Carnival Triumph tying up alongside  here and knowing that all of our guests and our crew members have made it here safely.  I know this is what our guests have been waiting for.  And I can tell you this is what we all at Carnival have been working towards.  Now, there's been a tremendous amount of effort that's gone in getting this ship back here.  Shit. 
[00:27:00]  And there's so many people I want to thank for helping us in this regard.  But I would like to specifically mention the United States Coast Guard, who's done a fantastic job.  Having that cutter alongside was tremendously helpful in reassuring our guests.  The United States Customs and Border Protection, who's expedited the clearing.  United States Public Health and the City of Mobile and the Port of Mobile have all been very gracious and helpful to us.  And I thank everyone.  But I'd also like to recognize the tremendous effort made by our shoreside teams in Miami and around the country. 
[00:27:30]  And mostly, our team on board.  Start playing the music from the Oscars.  Boring.  I know it has been very trying for our guests.  To get the fuck off the stage music.  But I can tell you that our crew worked tirelessly to try and make it as good of an experience as they possibly could for our guests.  And I want to thank them very much.  That's some of that babble, babble, babble crap.  I want to know who the comedian was on that ship.  Oh, shit.  Who was the cruise comic on that ship? 
[00:28:00]  He's got some fucking material.  Was he doing sets, though?  No, no microphone.  But impromptu sets.  I don't know.  Out on the deck.  That's who I want to find out.  Who was the carnival cruise ship comic?  Ah, so where are you from?  The fucking fire was actually a couple of audience members trying to commit suicide.  He's doing crowd work again.  Ah, so.  More from the CEO of Carnival Cruises.  One of the nice things for me is to see that many of our guests in online media and other types of media have recognized just how hard our crew has worked. 
[00:28:30]  And I appreciate the patience of our guests and their ability to cope with the situation.  And I'd like to reiterate the apology I made earlier.  I know the conditions on board were very poor.  I know it was very difficult.  Do you?  And I want to apologize again for subjecting our guests to that.  Bottle doodle.  We pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience. 
[00:29:00]  And clearly we failed in this particular case.  Epic fail.  It's kind of weird to hear a guy, you know, admitting anything.  Saying it was failure.  Yeah, they failed in their mission.  We kind of respect that.  But as he's admitting failure he's making sure that he takes lots of time to point out all the things they did well.  Right.  How great the crew was.  The crew, you know, it's nice to see the triumph come into port with all of our guests safe and sound. 
[00:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  The crew was remarkable and, yeah, we get it.  People, fire though, people forgive fire.  Because they know when it comes to fire just fucking wrecks everything.  Yeah.  People don't forgive anything.  And back in the day.  They're going to remember the smell of someone else's shit.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But, I mean, the fact that it's a fire makes it easier to swallow.  Yeah, back in the day that would have, like, killed people.  Yeah.  The ship would have sank.  Wow.  They figure that stuff out where it's very hard to sink a cruise ship these days. 
[00:30:00]  There can be a fire on it.  Yeah.  And it's still floating on the water.  Yeah, there can be a fire that shuts down the engines.  And it's still floating.  Right.  You know, you have some shit to contend with.  But, yeah, they're dropping fucking lobster off to you.  You think someone's still fired?  I don't know.  No.  Well, they'll figure out what caused the fire.  Right.  And they'll fire the guy that fired the fire fire.  Of course.  Here's more from the CEO.  Last clip, because this guy's boring.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'll get into some other shit.  Now, there's one other thing. 
[00:30:30]  I know we have been making media updates as we've gone throughout the course of the day,  providing the status of what's going on with the ship and all.  It's our plan to continue those.  We will continue those past the last guests getting off the ship and starting on their way home.  We know that we have gotten our guests back to land.  Now we need to get them home.  And we have the full resources of Carnival are working from here to get them home as quickly as we possibly can. 
[00:31:00]  Now, the most important thing for me at this point in time is to go on board and to apologize to our guests.  Once I finish that, I'm going to walk around and I'm going to try and help to expedite the process of getting them off and getting them on their way as quickly as I can.  Then I'm going to drive home.  So right now, that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to go on board and I'm going to apologize to the guests.  Because you're going to go apologize.  Yeah, to every guest.  And I heard they were putting them on buses and driving them to New Orleans or something.  Was that true?  I heard it was like a two-hour bus ride. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, they needed a bigger airport with more options.  To the Superdome.  Yeah.  Drop them off.  They needed more options for where people are going to go.  But imagine boarding a bus for two hours now.  Yeah.  Getting into that hotel room and taking that hot shower.  Ah.  First thing I would do is brush my teeth.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  I wonder if somebody went into like the bus bathroom and took a bad shit and stunk the  whole bus out.  How bad would that be?  The people are like, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Can't get away from this guy.  They make a rule on the bus.  No dumps. 
[00:32:00]  Look people, no more shitting.  Yeah.  Enough with the shitting.  We've all had it.  Hold your duties.  Big nice fucking lobster and onion sandwich shit.  Yeah.  Nice crab cake dump.  Crab cake and fucking warm milk dump.  What's worse than a crab cake dump?  Oh.  Yuck.  Um.  Yeah.  And everyone wants to have horrendous breath.  They're hitting on onion sandwiches.  Yeah.  And you can't brush your teeth for four days.  Oh.  Oh wow.  Loud shit.  You know how a loud shit must sound in a bag.  Ha ha ha ha. 
[00:32:30]  You fucking have your wife hold a bag while you.  Ha ha ha.  Honey, could you hold the bag?  Yeah.  You're supposed to be on a conga line right now.  Come on y'all.  You're getting on my knuckles.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Just those loud awful ones. 
[00:33:00]  Da da da da da da.  Da da da da.  They're doing a conga line with one person conga-ing the other behind him with a bag.  They're all just shitting on the deck.  My asshole's hot, hot, hot.  That would be wonderful.  There's a bit for you.  Guy talks about the isolation on the ship.  What's that?  Oh, no, let's do this one first.  Young girl and mom meet up with her, with their family, 
[00:33:30]  and say Carville had them take down their tent city before helicopters got there.  Well, that was what you were explaining.  You had to land the fucking helicopter somewhere.  And you look like you got a little sun.  Yeah, I did.  I'm probably peeling.  No, you look healthy and rosy cheeks and wonderful.  I guess people did spend a lot of time outdoors.  We had to, yes, sir.  Except for the last day, you know, it got so cold that, you know, everybody was out.  I know you really couldn't tell probably from the ship or the helicopters or whatever that were coming over today. 
[00:34:00]  But before that, I mean, it was just tent city.  I don't know if you all probably remember what the Superdome looked like in Katrina.  Well, that's what the deck looked like.  Slow down.  It was just unbelievable.  But they had asked us to take them all down when the helicopter started making deliveries.  And so we did that, and they straightened everything up.  And so it looks kind of tidy right now, but that was not the way it was.  And it was so unfortunate for those that had their beds and everything out there because we ran into rain. 
[00:34:30]  And they had no warning, and they all got sucked.  So it was really sad.  Oh, wow.  Well, welcome back.  That sucks your beds out there.  Yeah.  How many people must have been trying to fumble back down the steps of mattresses into their fucking duty chambers?  You're trying to lug a mattress into a fucking shit chamber.  It's raining.  Your sheets are soaked.  Oh, those fucking rules.  I want to hear more about the duty.  A duty chamber. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, boy, a duty ship.  Puts the whole boat on his head.  A duty ship.  And then never gets a job.  And then bitches about it.  And then bitches about us.  Oh, fuck you.  Ungrateful fuck.  Cocksucker.  We taught you the...  Shit hand.  Anyway.  That's...  Dude, you fucking got shit in your room.  I just want to hear about this shit.  But you go outside to get some fresh air.  Yeah.  You put your bed out.  You know what?  You're like, you know what?  We'll live with it.  Put your sheet up so nothing bugs don't get on you. 
[00:35:30]  Sure.  Nice breeze coming off the ocean.  Temperature's nice.  Fucking rain.  What is that?  Oh, it's rain.  You and your fat wife are trying to fudge your mattress back down steps in the line of  people.  Hold it.  Put your end up.  No, I'm...  40 minutes in the rain with your mattress up.  You're only on the cruise with your wife to try to save your marriage, and now you have  to deal with the shit ship.  Yeah.  Her cunt is stinking up the room again.  Just like home.  Fucking onion breath. 
[00:36:00]  I wonder if people were having sex on the ship.  Oh, sure.  First night, yeah.  By day five, we'd probably just jerk off and look at each other and request a room.  Oh, just smelling.  The guy's breath smells like his bag.  I'll tell you, I'm an armpit fan, though.  I probably would have enjoyed it.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  You would have been in heaven.  They were probably brushing their teeth, actually, with bottled water.  They probably were.  Well, a lot of these people said they couldn't brush their teeth for four or five days.  That's crazy.  You could use anything.  Well, I don't know how much water they had.  They were probably rationing all that shit out.  I would assume.  It was the shit in the minibar. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Here's the guy talking about the isolation on the ship.  This is really one of those classic experiments where you take a population, you isolate them,  you take away just about every modern convenience,  and then you work to see whether the good human nature rises to the top or fails.  In that experiment that you just went through, what would you say happened?  You know, I think you hit on the head.  It's not being connected with the outside world because we felt, really, when the first day,  you know, the day of the fire, and it was, you know, we had later in the day, there was like, 
[00:37:00]  okay, there's going to be a sister ship coming, going to drop provisions, and we were like,  oh, well, they're going to have Wi-Fi on there so we can get out because our communications pretty much  were cut off that, you know, we could get on the boat.  But so, you know, the ship came closer, and we're like, hey, we're getting signals.  You're getting out.  You're getting out.  So people were giving each other cell phones.  Hey, I can't get out, but I have whatever carrier, and I'm able to get through to loved ones,  and so that was awesome.  And then, obviously, the next day, we were able to get two more provisions dropped from other ships, 
[00:37:30]  and I think that kind of really kept people's spirits up.  But, you know, there was the three days where we had zero communication,  so I think people were getting a little antsy because they want to just, hey,  want to talk to your loved ones and let you know how we're doing.  Well, three days without a cell phone.  That's why I bring my satellite phone with me.  Nothing ever happens, but, you know, I always bring my sat phone.  People would have been fighting over your satellite phone.  Oh, they'd have been chasing me all over the fucking deck.  And you would have been screaming, leave me alone.  Get away from me.  My phone.  A hundred bucks a call. 
[00:38:00]  Would you be my phone guy?  Oh, I would be.  I'd be that guy.  You would be climbing on a pole somewhere.  Get away.  To get away from people.  And I'd just be calling, like, into Ron and Fez.  Right.  Yeah, what's up?  No important calls.  Just fucking, you know, chatting.  Well, the power might have been the problem.  You couldn't charge their phone.  No, they had charging stations.  Yeah.  Near the elevator banks, I believe.  Why did they have power?  Because of the reception?  Yeah, they just didn't have any signal out in the middle of the water.  No, no, and they did lose power. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  And then they had to recharge their phones, but they couldn't recharge everyone's phones.  And they didn't have a signal.  They didn't have a signal for a while.  Yeah, they didn't have a signal for three days.  Is there something that catches a signal on the boat that's...  A little bounce-a-roo, yeah.  They have Wi-Fi out there, so it goes to a satellite.  Yeah, you can bounce that shit.  So, yeah, you were able to use that to send messages out and whatnot.  And you could use their phones.  Right.  You know, their phones in the rooms, but it's all satellite.  Yeah.  And when that goes down, you know, you're fine. 
[00:39:00]  Here's the guy talking about the fire that started this whole mess.  Were you ever worried or afraid?  I mean, there's a fire on the ship.  Because, I mean, we heard about how it was listing.  I mean, there had to be moments where you said, I'm vulnerable out here.  Or did you never feel that way?  Yeah, I mean, a little bit.  You know, like I said, my personality, I take things in stride.  I don't want to worry too much, but I don't want to get overexcited.  But, you know, what I do remember is when you're on, going through the, you know,  the muster station drills and just safety procedures.  And they're talking about, you know, the worst thing that can happen on a ship is a fire. 
[00:39:30]  And you're like, yeah, well, that's not going to happen.  And then, of course, you know, you're woken up at 5.30 a.m.  by the captain saying, Alpha Team.  And you're putting two and two together.  And then you smell smoke.  And so, yeah, that was a little unnerving.  So I think at that point you're like, we were out here in the Gulf.  And, you know, there's nothing out here, you know.  And that was a little scary.  We were dead in the water.  I mean, for the, you know, the way to ourselves to put it.  And the, I'll just jump in the water with something.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Swim.  Swim back. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, man.  Space Rock is 150 feet wide.  That's the one that's going to pass near Earth.  Right.  Oh, that's not nearly as big as we thought.  That's not a couple of football players.  I'm going to, we should try to get.  Oh, Bill Nye.  Because when we were talking to somebody in Moscow, they said that communications went down.  Cell phone communication went down.  They were not certain if it was the meteor or if it was the number of people that were  getting on their cell phones to try to call their loved ones.  Hey, look at this.  This one, DA-14, 2012 DA-14, no, absolutely no way it's going to hit us. 
[00:40:30]  No way.  Oh, sure.  It will not hit any of our satellites.  Oh, how do you know?  Just very, very, very unlikely.  Oh.  Apparently there is a spent rocket fuselage that may have been a military rocket years ago  that it's going to come within 100 kilometers of, 60 miles of.  But even that's a miss.  The whole thing, everybody, is we don't know how many more of these objects are out there.  Oh, boy.  And if one of them hits a city or hits anything, it's going to destroy it.  Hey.  Just destroy it. 
[00:41:00]  And so this is a warning shot for us humans to watch the sky.  Now, if we had enough warning, if we had several years' warning, we could easily, we could do  something about it, we have the spacecraft technology, the space-faring nations of the  world could slow it down or speed it up just ever so slightly, and it would miss us.  And there's science fiction stories about asteroids and so on, but they're based on fact.  Which one's that?  Oh, my goodness.  And this is something for everybody to think about. 
[00:41:30]  The timing of this was really, really, really scary.  It's kind of cool in the middle of, well, scary, but it's also.  To you, it's cool to us.  It's a little scary.  Yeah, well, we're really happy that they are.  No, it's cool for everyone.  Yeah, don't worry, soul of dad.  Yeah, the news makes it scary.  Michu Kaku is going to be on Channel 2 CBS.  Maybe we could get him on our show today.  I texted Travis.  We're working on it.  Oh, we are working on it?  Good.  Oh, hi.  I try to introduce him to my son.  Oh, how'd that work?  Okay.  That's what I got. 
[00:42:00]  Okay.  I got to Kaku.  And then he crossed the street and started, like, double-timing it.  He's the weirdest.  He's the worst.  He is a scaredy cat.  He lives in Jimmy's building.  He lives right next door to me.  I see him all the time.  And every time I try to say hi to him, it's like the first time he's meeting me.  He's a scared.  Oh, he's so scared.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, okay.  Don't hurt me.  That's why his hair is so white.  Don't hurt me.  He's actually 24 years old.  Hi, we've met 40 times.  Hi, you're an apparition. 
[00:42:30]  A ghost.  It's unbelievable.  He is a scaredy cat.  Anyway, this is my favorite clip coming up because, you know, we all know the news loves to fucking pump shit up.  Oh, yeah.  They're all about pumping shit up, right?  Oh, yeah.  And I believe this guy gave the news a bit of a face, right?  Yeah.  A little bit of a face to the news.  And the isolation factor you described, this is the same sort of thing many people who went through Katrina in New Orleans,  those that were left behind.  They never heard anything either. 
[00:43:00]  And it's, your mind begins to race.  You wonder if anybody knows of the circumstance you're in.  You think you're all alone.  And, of course, any rumor becomes solid fact, and it spreads in a very closed environment.  So I imagine it's something very similar.  Yeah, but, you know, let's put that perspective.  I mean, Katrina was a major devastation.  We're on a freaking cruise ship, and we're just out having a good time.  So, you know, from that angle, and I get it because it is the isolation of communication, but two different things.  You know, two different things.  Ah, nice.  I'm so proud of people. 
[00:43:30]  Good people, yes.  Because they're starting to figure it all out.  Like, enough of your shit.  It's not like Katrina.  Guy's trying to equate it with fucking Katrina.  And the guy said, look, we're on a freaking cruise ship.  More and more people are figuring it out.  Thank God.  Sorry, you know, we're out there on the Lido deck having daiquiris.  Right.  We're not in our attic.  Right.  As water's creeping up and having to cut a hole in the roof.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a little different.  Hoping you could even cut a hole in the roof.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of those people weren't able to do that.  Yeah.  And that's how they met their fucking maker.  A little different.  If there is a maker. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Yes.  Well, here's some ladies talking about their horrible experience.  Oh.  These are the ladies that the news keeps showing.  Right.  Because they finally found one.  Yeah, these are the old bitties that got off the boat and were all pissed off about everything.  Oh, good.  This is exactly what they were looking for.  So, Andy, if you watched this morning, these are the ladies that...  They're going to show over and over again?  They're the stars.  Yeah.  But the fact is, most people were okay.  Just okay with what happened, right?  Yeah.  So, this is kind of an exception? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All the clips I watched.  And then what the news does, they take the exception and then they slam it down your fucking throat all day long.  We are glad to be on dry land.  It's just been a horrible experience for us.  It was a great cruise to start off with, but it just...  You know, the morning of the fire...  Sunday morning at 5.30, there was a fire alarm.  Oh, shut up.  And we've been kept in the dark a lot.  We haven't been told everything that we probably should have known. 
[00:45:00]  And it was just, you know, the things just kept getting worse and worse.  And we could never, ever really get a straight answer.  The bathroom facilities were horrible.  We couldn't flush toilets.  No electricity.  No electricity.  No air.  Our rooms were in total darkness.  We had no air.  And we had...  It's just been a really, really taxing experience for us.  The phone, no lights, no motor cars.  I mean, we heard a lot of threats people on this ship right now. 
[00:45:30]  I'm sure.  Fucking hens.  Yeah.  Primitive as can be.  Just babbling.  Hens.  Mm-hmm.  And we didn't have toilets to flush.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  Well, they continue here.  Oh.  I don't...  Honestly, I don't think this ship should have ever sailed out.  And how do you know that?  How do you know that?  And please tell me how you know that.  Please tell me how you know that.  Yeah.  I inspected the engines before it left, and there seemed to be an anomaly.  Certainly in hindsight, but how do you, you dumb bitch, know that for sure? 
[00:46:00]  Yakety-yak.  I think there's, you know, issues with it, and I think it should have probably stayed in  Dauphin.  Oh.  It's an old ship.  It's been around for a long time.  1999, I believe.  Now, the CEO, Jerry Cahill, is here.  I don't know if you know that.  He came on and he apologized.  Is that enough?  Are you...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There are a lot of unhappy people on this ship.  A lot of unhappy people.  Mm-hmm.  Because of the conditions and the way things just went downhill from the first day. 
[00:46:30]  Downhill, it's water.  Six, it's on level.  We couldn't...  We floated for over 100 miles.  Somewhere around 100 miles.  Yes.  For an old day.  They were assessing the situation from Sunday morning at 5.30 to probably, I guess, midnight  that night.  Midnight.  They still did not know because they could not open the fire, the engine room where the  fire took place.  Oh, gosh.  And so, we were just floating and they said we floated out to sea about 100 miles.  I heard 500, but...  Wasn't it 500?  That's what I heard, too. 
[00:47:00]  But these...  I mean, these are obviously...  You take it from these yentas?  Mm-hmm.  These hens?  Bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok.  Shut it.  Did they get anything right?  I'm noticing you both have...  These are the robes from the rooms?  Right.  Because it got so cold, it got...  Oh, because it got so cold, you didn't have a coat.  Well, no.  We were in...  No.  Right.  You know, it got so cold and then our rooms got...  We're so uncomfortable.  As we kept getting closer and closer to the...  I guess, Alabama, we got...  Just got colder. 
[00:47:30]  We couldn't leave our door open for fresh air.  The hallways were toxic.  Full of urine.  Our bathrooms were full of urine.  Our showers were...  I think the worst part of this whole thing, to me, was that...  I don't think they had a backup plan of any kind for this type of situation.  They did.  It's what they did.  And that's what a lot of people started realizing.  They weren't...  It looked like they were just trying to figure it out as they were going.  And then they'd figure something out and then they'd change their mind and then they'd  try to figure something else out.  Getting a lot of mixed messages. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  It was never like, this is the plan.  I'd honestly...  I don't think there was a backup plan.  Shut up.  Yeah.  They bother me, but they're probably, you know, speaking some truths there.  Yeah.  It seems like the, you know, the cruise line there didn't know what the fuck they were  doing.  How unpleasant would those women have been on board?  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine they were your neighbors?  As you're trying to shit in your bathtub, you hear them?  They're the ones that bitch at a perfect cruise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there wasn't enough food.  I went to the buffet and they were all out of the crab meat. 
[00:48:30]  There was no...  Before I got there.  And I...  Oh, just bitching.  Bitching.  There was no butter at breakfast this morning.  Yes.  Yes, they didn't bring the butter.  Oh, God.  The fruit basket, the peaches were overripe.  Like everything's a problem with them.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  that's but i would i would be that that's how you would be out of your mind why was this boat let to

[00:56:00]  In the park  Fourth of July  Fourth of July  People dancing 
[00:56:30]  People laughing  A man selling ice cream  Singing Italian song  Yes I can  I've been waiting such a long time  Waiting such a long time  Whoa, why are we playing Chicago? 
[00:57:00]  Because they're one of the coolest bands ever  Oh, not according to Sam, I'm sure  They formed 46 years ago today  46?  Yep  Wow  July  46 years ago?  No  Yeah, they're an old band 
[00:57:30]  They're an old band  Absolutely  Oh my God  They've been around forever  Sam, we're rocking out  Listen to what we're listening to  We're rocking it today  What?  Chicago  Oh  Slow motion rider  That's what you're listening to? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, we're rocking it  Sometimes I like them  And sometimes I think they absolutely stink  Stink?  Sometimes they annoy me  Oh  This isn't good  Why isn't this good?  You don't like this?  No, it's horrible  Can we declare it a Chicago day  On the Opie and Anthony show?  No  We did Doobie Brothers Day  I know  It's our show  We can declare things  We can do that, Sam  We can declare  It's just so dated  Who's going to call it?  Are we going to do this officially or what? 
[00:58:30]  Don't do it  What do you think?  What do you think?  Today is Chicago Day  Yeah  On the Opie and Anthony show  Celebrating  Forty  What?  Forty-six years  Forty-six years of Chicago  Forty-six years  Shut up, Sam  Saturday  In the park  Every day's a deep dish pizza  Alright, I'm going to start picking  Out my songs  Yeah  Yeah, fuck yeah  Chicago Day  On the Opie and Anthony show  Twenty-five or six to four 
[00:59:00]  I think twenty-five or six to four  Should be one of our songs today  Let me see  What else would you pick?  Twenty-five or six to four  I don't know what those songs are  And it's all Chicago  Twenty-five or six to four  Isn't that just them singing about the highway system?  In and around Chicago, I think  I think it was a drug reference  Oh, I heard it was like fucking highways  I said it was LSD-25  Yeah  And six to four  Yeah  Um, something  I don't know  Shut up, Sam  You're out of this one, man 
[00:59:30]  If Ant does the voice  It makes it a little  J-n-n-n-n-n  Oh, no, no  Wait, I could probably  be totally due to this  It's horrible  Hey  That's a good jam.  Break of day!  This is terrible. 
[01:00:00]  This is alright.  You don't like this? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  No, we shouldn't be doing it.  Shut up, I'm writing my song list.  How long is it?  I'm going to go with...  Into space!  What year do you think this song is?  70s.  My face!  You don't know anything that was ever done before you were born? 
[01:01:00]  History.  You should learn history, man.  Hey, I'm going to go with...  Does anybody really know what time it is?  And also want to hear later on...  Feeling Stronger Every Day.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Didn't they do a Karate Kid song?  That was Peter Cetera.  Oh, I always mix him up with them.  Who was in Chicago.  He was a Chicago guy.  That's what it did.  And he busted out in a solo career and did...  I am the man who will fight for your honor.  Was he the lead singer of Chicago? 
[01:01:30]  There were a lot of singers in Chicago.  Yeah, they kind of like took turns.  Okay.  Yeah, a lot of singing going on.  Did Peter Cetera ever go back to Chicago?  I'm sure he has.  The city?  No.  He was told never to return.  He was banned.  Yes.  They said, whenever you come to the city, we love your songs so much.  We just dance the night away.  We don't get any work done.  Stay out of the city, you faggot.  This music is very corny.  This is a good song.  This is Karate Kid 2, by the way. 
[01:02:00]  Karate Kid 2, Electric Boogaloo.  Yeah.  I believe it would be full title.  This is where Mr. Sato...  Oh.  Yes.  They had a beef over that girl.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Daniel-san wanted to get some of that sideways-mounted pussy.  Woo!  Mr. Sato felt disrespected because Mr. Miyagi, they were on a train with that girl.  Yeah.  And Mr. Miyagi busted in her box before Sato licked it.  So now he had to karate chop him.  Well, what happened was, yeah, she took so much dick that her pussy was hurting. 
[01:02:30]  So he took his hands and he went...  Slacked them together, rubbed them, and then rubbed her pussy, and it was all good for fucking again.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  So, uh, it's Chicago Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Maybe we could get Modest Yahoo to do a Chicago song for us.  Oh, man.  That would bring it all together, I'm thinking.  I mean, it would bring it all together.  I just don't know why we're celebrating the band Chicago.  Hero.  And we got breaking news for the people waking up.  A meteor hit Russia.  We're not fucking with you people.  You'll see it for yourself when you turn on the old news.  Clips are up on our Facebook page. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, there's some great video coming out.  And, uh, yeah, Opie and Anthony on Facebook if you want to check those out.  I have to correct somebody on Twitter.  Don't fucking challenge me.  What happened?  Someone said, uh, Anthony, when, uh, AIDS, when, when a meteor goes into the atmosphere,  it's called a meteorite.  It's like, oh, stupid.  A meteor comes into the atmosphere.  A meteorite is what is left on the ground after a meteor. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe he meant it's a meteorite.  Oh, maybe that's what he meant.  Okay.  Getting back to the Russia thing.  Remember we said, uh, it seems like they love their dash cams.  Yes.  Remember that?  A lot of dash cams.  Um, I'm trying to find the tweet because someone was helping us out today.  As to why.  Yeah, it turns out, yeah, people are absolutely about, all about the dash cams.  Here it is.  Uh, oh, it's good old, uh, Matthew, uh, Bishop.  I like Matthew Bishop.  Go to his Twitter. 
[01:04:00]  Matthew Bishop on Twitter.  Uh, basically, the reason for all the dash cams in Russia is that pedestrians throw themselves  in front of cars.  What?  Is that what's going on in Russia?  I guess.  And there's an article from, uh, Business Insider.  And, uh, Matthew Bishop would not lie to me.  You got the article?  Sam?  Which one?  I bet them read.  I should go to Matthew Bishop's, uh, Twitter.  That's true.  You were told.  And then you'll see a link for the Business Insider article. 
[01:04:30]  Link?  Yeah, I want to see what this is all about.  Why are people throwing themselves in front of cars?  Is it that bad over there?  Scams?  Or they go, yeah.  Someone's saying here, too, they do the old, um, stop short and, um, crash into people  kind of, uh, uh, insurance scams.  Wow, really?  Doing that shit.  Must be a nightmare to drive over there.  It's crazy.  Videos of car accidents filmed from dashboard cameras have become such a popular genre on  YouTube, it seems every driver must be filming his every move. 
[01:05:00]  Why is that?  In a post on Animal, what does that mean?  Uh, Russian ex-pat and journalist Marina Gaparina offers a few, uh, reasons which boil down  to dangerous driving conditions and the unreliability of Russian traffic police.  So they're trying to take care of their own asses.  But they're a little corrupt.  Driving in Russia is hazardous.  Last year, 200,000 traffic accidents killed 28,000 people.  Wow. 
[01:05:30]  You should ban cars over there.  More than 32,000 died in car accidents in the United States in 2011, a much lower figure  per capita.  So a lot more people are, uh, the averages are, are, are greater in Russia is basically  what they're saying.  Cha.  Uh, what else?  Uh, gyros certainly play a role.  Anything else in this article?  No, they were just talking about how bad the road rage is.  And then there's a couple of videos of like compilations of road rage. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  The guy, cause he stopped short.  I can't see.  I thought I was at home.  Yeah.  Sam's just relaxing with his feet up.  Like he's fucking watching YouTube with his friends.  Well, now we know why they have the dash cams.  Oh, that guy's just smashing his car as he's trying to drive by him.  Tire iron.  That was a tire iron?  Holy fuck.  That guy.  What kind of mental patient is. 
[01:06:30]  This guy is walking in the crosswalk and a car kind of pretty much like tapped him.  So the guy tries to push the entire car from the side.  And then he runs away.  Watch.  Watch him try to push the car from the side.  What's he doing?  He just bounces off the thing.  That doesn't work.  No.  A lot of cameras there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They love their traffic cam.  Look at this guy.  Everyone's stuck in traffic.  What is this guy doing?  He's driving through traffic like a tank.  He's literally pushing cars.  He's a go-getter, this guy. 
[01:07:00]  He doesn't want to wait.  He's going between two cars that he can't possibly fit between.  He's squeezing between the two and just scraping the other ones.  And the guy gets out of his fucking car.  And now he's marching toward the car that just scraped.  He's going to get him.  Oh, boy.  No one stops for these things.  They just...  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What did they do?  A guy was walking across the street.  He tracked a trailer, side-swiped him, and he's alive.  But he looks like he did it on purpose. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  He ran toward the truck.  Yeah.  Look at...  This guy's trying to open his door and get up.  Get him running.  Yeah.  He like...  Stop.  They see it coming.  And he goes, all right, this is my opportunity.  He runs right into the side of a truck.  Wow.  Why are they doing that?  He wasn't trying to cross the street.  He was trying to get hit by the money.  How do you know, is it?  Trying to get some insurance money?  Yeah.  Let's hit them in the wrong.  Now we see a guy opening his door to get out.  Just peeking out his driver's side door. 
[01:08:00]  And something bad's going to happen here.  He gets out.  Holy shit.  What's he...  What?  He's just fucking driving at the guy.  Oh, he's beating this guy up.  Oh, some guy's getting punched.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Now we're just behind a guy who stopped.  The guy in front of this car is getting out.  He just gets out.  Two guys are fighting.  They're just beating the shit out of each other.  Russians are so mad.  Yeah, they really are.  Russians are very angry people.  They throw down quick. 
[01:08:30]  This shit happens obviously here, but we don't have our dash cams yet.  And they also said per capita it's way more in Russia.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Oh, vodka drinking.  Can we put this article up on the Facebook page?  Since we can't show the people live over Washington.  Yeah, yeah.  Then we can comment on it.  It would be fun for everybody.  We should have a podcast.  We could do that.  Oh.  They're still fighting these guys.  What's a podcast?  Would your road rage get worse or better if this was what you had to contend with?  Like if you knew that fights were happening all the time, would you chill out or would you be worse? 
[01:09:00]  No, I don't even think about the consequences of road rage.  I would be, I don't know, I would behave.  I'm not crazy with road rage, but when I do get it, I'm all in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy's cutting in.  Two cars trying to cut into the same space.  Now this guy's all pissed.  One guy doesn't want to let him.  Oh my God.  I certainly get that.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  But they get out of that car fast.  The two guys trying to merge them.  Yeah.  They don't care.  They drive like tanks.  They don't care about damaging you.  No, they bump into each other.  They don't care.  Just a shitty, angry place.  What a strange place.  We don't know much about it.  Yeah.  Now these guys are going to have to fight because one guy squeezed the head of the other guy.  You're going to have to, right?  Of course.  The guy in the front gets out.  Yeah.  There you go.  He's fucking.  And he's hassling the guy in the window.  Why do they leave the doors unlocked?  He opens his door for him and now he's pulling the guy out of his own car.  He's kicking him.  He's kicking him.  Pulling him out and kicking him. 
[01:10:00]  Wow.  And the guy just slammed the guy's car shut.  He slammed it.  And then goes back to his car.  Did he?  Yeah.  He pulled his arm out and slammed the car door.  Rushed past the law that they must carry insurance.  Isn't that a given?  Wow.  Wow.  Now he's just a truck.  Wow.  A truck just rear-ended the guy.  The guy probably stopped to get rear-ended.  Yeah.  I'll bet you they do that so when you rear-end them you get in trouble.  Okay.  And now the guy gets out of his car immediately. 
[01:10:30]  He's going to have to fight, right?  Yeah.  The fight has to happen.  Now you've got to fight?  It's a part of...  Oh, that's dumb language.  Stripper talk.  That's stripper talk.  Now there's a guy...  What's he doing?  He's pulling a red rope out from underneath a car.  We're going to tow your vehicle.  What is this?  I don't know.  There's three guys standing around.  He's like, don't throw my car away.  Oh, he's trying to tow, but the guy won't let it.  Okay.  Why are they fighting over there?  There's a guy in a suit shoving another guy. 
[01:11:00]  Is this lizard-like towing?  Oh, now they're fucking going all out.  Yeah.  Neither one of them can fight, though.  No.  No.  Now they're just trying.  The guy in the suit's getting punched.  Oh, here they go.  They're swinging wild.  Why are they beating the shit out of each other?  Wow.  They are swinging.  I want that guy in the suit to get a beating.  Well, it looks like the other guy was helping him by trying to tow his car.  Oh, now he takes his shirt off.  Yeah, suit guy is still dressed.  He's a pasty Russian.  He didn't want to get his car towed.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's just another fixed fight. 
[01:11:30]  Russians.  Guy got his hat punched off.  They're in the middle of the road.  They really do fight.  We just don't have a lot of this footage in America.  No.  Other people are just trying to drive.  One guy's in a headlock.  I like it, though.  It's all one-on-one.  You know?  I like that.  And the fights aren't that bad.  These are.  These are kind of...  Well, these guys, I'm sure, will help the situation.  Okay, they're breaking up that fight.  They're breaking it up.  All right.  Now you got these guys just walking in front of traffic.  They're in a crosswalk.  Oh, they get tapped by another car.  Guy plowed into them. 
[01:12:00]  He just drove right into them.  Yeah, he just didn't see them.  You think they're going to have to fight now?  Of course.  Of course.  That's grounds for a fight.  When in doubt, throw up your dukes.  All right, now another dash cam.  They're out of light.  Yeah, this guy's unhappy with the car.  He threw something at it.  All right, now people in the crosswalk.  Oh, he got hit.  They got to see a hit.  All right, now we're just behind a car and a truck.  Yeah, and a truck.  They're going over a railroad crosswalk.  A van just went over the fucking median.  He's driving in the other lane. 
[01:12:30]  Three and a half foot median.  They're nuts, these Russians.  Oh, he just cut off that guy.  Oh, that's not going to end well.  So he's going to bump him.  He just bumped him.  He bumped him.  Which means he's going to stop the car.  Yeah.  Now they're arguing.  Fight.  All right, he stopped the car because he got bumped.  And of course, he gets out.  Yeah, why wouldn't he get out?  Now we will fight.  It's time for a fight.  Look at the date.  It's a day after Christmas.  Oh, Jesus.  And the guy just put his fist up and threatened to punch the other guy. 
[01:13:00]  That's wincing.  Now he's pissed off because his truck got dented a little bit.  They're trying to discuss the situation.  He's going, what the fuck?  I was going this way.  He's checking the car.  Now he's studying the other guy's damage.  Well, the one guy cut in front of the other guy.  Is that it?  No fight, it looks like, huh?  No fight.  We'll get the new vehicle.  Oh, no fight there.  All right.  They just talked it over.  Some in the middle of the road here.  Oh.  Yeah.  He just gets plowed into it.  People love running people over in Russia.  Well, you know what it is.  These people walk on the crosswalk.  This guy, that guy just got hit walking across the crosswalk. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And another guy's right behind him just like, well, I'll cross.  He was sauntering.  The guy sauntered.  Yeah, everyone's going to stop now so I can cross.  Yes.  Oh, another one.  We actually do it.  We actually do it.  That was almost a two-pedestrian's murder.  Oh, man.  What, is he going after that guy?  But he has nothing to do with this guy.  He's yelling at him.  What the fuck?  All right, now they're stopped in traffic.  He wants to make a... 
[01:14:00]  Oh, for whatever, there's two cars...  Oh, wow.  Guy just crashed.  They really stink at driving.  They're terrible at it.  All right, this car is flying.  Oh, my...  He almost killed the guy.  There was a guy crossing a four-lane highway just walking, strolling across the street.  Now what's happening is...  Oh, gaggle of people.  People making left right in front of...  A guy was making a left right in front of traffic.  Two of them did.  Oh, my God. 
[01:14:30]  They're terrible drivers in Russia.  All right, now they're all trying to merge.  Oh, he tapped that guy.  You think he's going to have to get out?  He pulled that last-minute pull in front of a guy.  I don't think this guy's going to get out.  Guy in a scream mask.  Why is the guy in a scream mask hanging out the window?  But I'm sure someone will punch it off for him.  He's swinging a knife at the other driver.  Russian hijinks.  Russian hijinks.  Yes, indeed.  Oh, these guys roll.  Yeah.  What's the next video?  Russians are great.  Pedestrian scams.  Oh, pedestrian scams. 
[01:15:00]  They are horrid drivers.  And these videos are up on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, go ahead.  And people.  That says scams cost insurance companies in Russia $100 million each year.  Do you read Russian?  I do, actually.  Oh.  And they're trying to stop it, but it's very difficult.  Oh, shit, I lost that one.  The prime minister said don't do that.  I was reading the writing.  All right, they circle the guys.  Oh. 
[01:15:30]  Holy fuck.  They're sick.  They're insurance scare.  You try to run in front of them.  Right.  And then when the car stopped, he ran away.  Yeah, you got to be fully aware.  Oh, yeah, a guy just runs out.  This guy's just trying to get hit.  They're trying to get hit.  That's so fucked up.  They run out in, like, slower traffic.  Right.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  100% of the time, it will be tried.  Oh, wow.  I'm reading what it says.  100% of the time, it will be tried.  Let's see what this guy does.  Oh, my.  It just dove. 
[01:16:00]  He dove, and he hit the side of the car with his hand.  Easy way to get money over there, I guess.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fuck that.  He's eating food and fucking...  What's this guy up to?  You can tell.  You can tell.  Here he goes.  Oh, my God.  He just ran into the side of a bus.  And the bus kept going.  He ran into the side of a bus.  What a douchebag.  And then he picks up his leash, and he realized it didn't work, so he took his dog and left.  The bus kept going.  It hit him in the face.  It hit him in the face.  Look at this guy.  Look at him running into a car. 
[01:16:30]  They just run into cars.  What the fuck?  This is so fucked up.  That's great.  And there's a gang of kids with him to stop the car from going anywhere.  Wow.  Now there's a tractor trailer.  The guy's going out on the side of it.  Oh, man.  That guy was trying to hold on to the back of a truck.  No, but the bottom line is the truck didn't stop.  It's pulling over.  Most of them don't stop, though, because they know it's a huge scam.  What do you say?  You say, oh, I was fucking walking, and I got hit by the side of a truck. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Right.  They didn't have the balls to jump in front of it.  Did you guys have any idea this was going on in Russia?  No.  They keep pointing to the pedestrians that are trying to get hit.  This guy's just walking casually in front of a bus.  The bus stops, though.  In Russia, you hit the car.  Oh, I get it.  This makes my new book look really irrelevant, though.  What's your new book?  Traffic scams never happen in Russia.  This is really going to blow the load off my new book.  All right, now you've got this guy to the left here. 
[01:17:30]  What's going to happen to him?  He's waiting for his opportunity.  Yeah, yeah.  He sees that car.  Going slow.  He's making believe he doesn't see him.  Oh, that was pussy.  Yeah.  He didn't commit to that.  And then he's like, didn't you see the sign?  Where's he going?  What's he doing?  What's he doing?  He's trying to stand in front of the car so the guy can't leave.  They're going to have to fight.  How about a fight?  I think they should settle this with a fight.  He knows if he goes around the side.  So he's standing in front of the car so he can't drive away. 
[01:18:00]  He's probably trying to look for a quick handout.  Like, look, we'll take care of this right here.  Right here in Brainerd.  Brainerd.  He's here in Moscow.  Now we've got a dash cam.  The guy's going about 30 miles an hour.  Let's see what happens here.  All righty.  Nothing, nothing.  Uh-oh.  They pointed out the pedestrian.  That's going to cause a problem.  We missed it.  I guess he hit the side of the vehicle.  This guy just kept going.  He just kept going?  Nope, he's stopping.  What a...  It's just constant. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  They keep pointing out the guys that are about to run into the middle of the road.  What a fucking maniac.  Look at this guy.  He just runs in the road.  Oh!  And he just jumps on the car.  I never knew this was happening.  This is unbelievable.  They just stand there and wait to get hit by a car.  That's their job.  But they do it in such a way they know they're not going to get killed.  They jump up in the air.  They jump onto the side of these vehicles.  Except the guy got hit in the face with a blast.  Right.  That was classic.  Jump onto the hood a little bit. 
[01:19:00]  The music is really good in these videos.  Do you like it?  No, I don't.  It's not good at all, Sam.  Oh.  Let's see what's going on here.  Slowing down.  In like a town.  Traffic light.  Sunday drive.  Yeah.  All right.  And they point out the guy that's going to cause the problem.  And there he goes.  Oh, my God.  He just goes rolling over the hood.  They fucking roll right off the hood.  Green arrow guy.  What is he going to do?  Another rolling onto the hood.  They jump onto the hood.  It's so obvious. 
[01:19:30]  They stop the car and the guy jumps onto the hood anyway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think they're looking for a payout on the spot or are they going to go through the whole insurance thing?  Probably a pad on the spot.  Probably a little of both, right?  Yeah, you do this and we call the police.  Right.  That's my waffle Russian accent.  It says right there a lot of times the police are not called.  There's a little thing in Russian accent.  Oh, thank you.  So that answers that.  How much longer in this video?  Yeah, the music is terrible.  That's it.  That's it.  And what's the next one?  All right.  And the next one is just now for nearly three minutes of dash cam videos.  What does that mean?  I think it's just videos of cars and people getting hit by cars. 
[01:20:00]  Car accidents, people getting hit, fights, I'm sure.  That's incredible.  Fights.  All right.  I'll tweet the link for everyone.  How can they find it?  OP Radio on Twitter.  I do want to thank Matthew Bishop, actually.  He gets the big plug today.  That's great.  People are going to love that.  That's fucked up.  Black History Month.  I didn't tell you my celebrity.  Oh, fuck, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy flew back from L.A.  I heard you had a great Leno appearance. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, it was really good.  I got to pet an ostrich.  It was fun.  Aren't they mean?  No, it was amazing.  The guy had an ostrich.  I heard they're mean.  No.  No?  No, he was, I was feeding him dog food out of my hand.  Really?  It's like interacting with a dinosaur.  Really?  The guy, I asked the guy, what was his name, Jared Wright or something?  Jared something?  I asked him.  Do we have the clip?  Can we play it?  No, if you don't see that, that was backstage.  I did it.  Oh.  I asked him if I could look at the, can I come close?  He goes, yeah, come over.  He goes, go over to it. 
[01:21:00]  You'll never be this close to an ostrich again.  So I get the, it's weird to feel like the feathers, it's like a giant turkey.  Really?  It's like a giant turkey.  A giant turkey.  With a giant neck and the neck is like always bobbing around your head.  You're a turkey.  Oh, stop it.  I don't need to hurt a brother's feelings.  I hear their meat is good to eat.  Yeah, people do eat them.  And they can kill you at their feet.  It was really fucking weird.  Sounds like fucking, what's her name down there?  Yeah, like a fucking Nicole Biggins.  Yeah.  Big ostrich footed. 
[01:21:30]  Kill you with her fucking ostrich feet, yes.  Her talons.  But I got to, I got to pet his big feathers.  I was so cute.  And he kept, he kept eating out of my hand.  His little beak was, his big beak was snipping my hand.  He was biting the hand that feeds it?  He really was.  It's all a lot of proportion and shit, those things.  Their head's so tiny.  Their head's tiny, big, huge fucking medicine ball body, and then long, weird fucking dinosaur legs.  They go 40 miles an hour, though.  I know.  That's amazing.  And they kick.  They kick?  Not if they're threatened, but they said they can at times. 
[01:22:00]  Like the Rockettes?  Yes.  Only to certain music.  And then all of a sudden, the ostrich will do a silly dance right into an elevator shaft.  I'd pay to see that.  But I loved feeding him and playing with him.  Aw.  But whatever.  Are they intelligent?  I don't know.  They couldn't meet with their heads that big.  True.  True that.  Big eyes.  They got the big eyes, right?  I tweeted pictures of me and the ostrich. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Very cute.  Aw.  But I had an almost celebrity sighting on the plane last night.  Ooh.  I thought, I thought Lance Armstrong was on my flight.  Because the guy looked like Lance Armstrong.  Oh, no.  And I, no, I didn't.  And I Googled Lance Armstrong.  Like, that's him.  And did he just fucking reach into his lap and feel around?  Like, no, sorry.  I thought he was someone else.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I asked the flight attendant. 
[01:23:00]  Because everybody was asleep.  And I'm like, is that Lance Armstrong?  She's like, no.  Asshole.  And she would know, too, because they see the fucking, everybody wasn't staring at him.  Like, Lance Armstrong would attract a lot of attention.  Oh, he sure would.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  But I went out for, two nights ago, I went out for some frozen yogurt with my manager and  my ex-girlfriend.  Do tell.  We're sitting at the table with this guy.  I'm like, I know him from somewhere.  And I'm like, is that Tobin Bell from Saw?  And I'm like, no, it's not Tobin Bell.  Oh. 
[01:23:30]  And we're all bouncing around.  And as he walks out, my manager goes, Rutger Hauer?  Oh, really?  It was fucking Rutger Hauer.  I should have followed him out and got a celebrity picture with him, but I just didn't.  I'm so stupid.  That was a fucking good sighting, man.  I had a great run-in with Rutger Hauer years ago.  Oh, you met him already?  Yeah.  He was on Rana Fez's show back at NEW, and he was throwing pens and pencils at me.  Why?  I don't know, because I just kept bringing up movies that he was in.  Did he like you?  I couldn't tell.  I think he was having fun, but he started throwing things at me. 
[01:24:00]  I kept bringing up, like, lines from Blade Runner and shit like that.  He was in The Firm?  Yeah, Rutger Hauer's been in a lot of shit.  Rutger.  Yeah.  Very cool.  I should have got a picture.  Yeah.  My frozen yogurt was delicious.  You should have.  Where'd you go?  Any toppings?  Pinkberry?  No, I don't even go to Pinkberry.  I went to...  That's too bad.  Why are you wearing a suit and tie on Leno?  I just felt like it, and I knew it was a holiday show with me, and it was a good suit. 
[01:24:30]  I bought that for the Ali thing.  You look like a gentleman.  Let me see.  You look like a gentleman.  Oh, look.  He's wearing a little tie.  Yeah.  Not Jimmy.  The ostrich.  It's very weird.  The ostrich is wearing...  It was a Colombian necktie, actually.  He snitched.  They pulled his tongue through his throat.  Is this the clip from last night?  There's no clip of me in The Ostrich.  I don't want to watch the clip of me.  I can't...  You can't do it?  No.  I never watched them.  But there's no clips of me in The Ostrich, unfortunately.  Oh.  All right.  I feel like wearing a suit.  Big bird.  From now on, I'm going to wear a suit on the tonight show.  Big birdie.  Gentlemen. 
[01:25:00]  Let's do some Black History Month.  When we get back, Stalker Patty's going to give us an update on our stupid life.  Her dumb, boring, stupid life.  More inventions from the African-American community.  Yes.  He's given us a lot.  And I thought we should honor that.  Yeah.  And we have been all month.  Let's do it.  Sure, sure.  And when we get back, Stalker Patty.  Getting married to Fez from Ron and Fez, I guess, right?  Yeah.  You ready for Stalker Patty?  No. 
[01:25:30]  Can you ever be ready for Stalker Patty?  That voice of us.  Is she here yet?  Well, I needed to take off from G-Bucks.  Apparently.  Is Ronnie making them live together if they get married?  I would think so.  I gave that to Ronnie.  I said, Ronnie, you have to make them live together.  Then you need cameras.  You've got to fucking camera out the house because that would be unbelievable.  Or it's a sham.  It's a dumb wedding sham.  But if they're forced to live together for a little while, that would be great, too. 
[01:26:00]  I know they're really getting married.  It's not a fake fucking marriage.  It's a real marriage.  I just got word that she decided not to come in.  And she will call in if you like.  That's the quote.  She decided.  She decided not to come in today.  What?  I don't know.  Why is Mars laughing?  Because you go, what?  What the fuck?  What do you mean you decided not to come in?  She decided, I'm not going to come in today. 
[01:26:30]  Is that true, Travis?  Yeah.  I mean.  What's wrong with her?  Does any of this really surprise you?  So, she was supposed to come in last Friday, but we got a couple guests at the last minute.  I don't want to eat up my vacation minutes.  Right.  And the snowstorm was a big unknown.  So, I told her, I said, don't come in.  This was last Friday, because, you know, we probably wouldn't get to you.  And we wouldn't have gotten to her.  So, I was like, come in next Friday.  And that's where we left it. 
[01:27:00]  And I messaged her this morning, saying, are you coming in?  And she said, oh, I never confirmed with you, so I'm not, you can call me.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, we'll call her after the break, I guess.  Call me, maybe.  Why not just confirm with me?  Like, we never do this.  Like, I said, I said last week, I said, all right, we'll see you Friday.  If I need to cancel, I'll let you know.  Right.  Yeah, but someone like her, she needs a lot more than that.  Apparently.  I don't know how her fucking brain works. 
[01:27:30]  We'll talk to her next, at least.  Her brain works like that ostrich.  Yeah.  Just fucking one thought at a time.  Stupid she is.  Here's today's invention.  Dumb look in her eyes.  Dumb little head.  Old ostrich head patty.  Here's today's invention by a black man.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the  great African-American inventors.  Today, we honor Philip Downing, inventor of the mailbox. 
[01:28:00]  I'm so sick of having muddy mail.  Yo, neighbor, get your dirty letters off my lawn, bitch.  How on earth do you keep your mail so clean?  Because I invented a mailbox, nigga.  My mail stays fresh.  Fresh to death, kid.  Wow, that's terrific.  Must be quite a treat collecting your mail.  Yeah, this letter's from your wife.  Damn that bitch talk dirty.  Fiddlesticks.  The Mailbox.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives. 
[01:28:30]  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious Maxim.  Somewhere in the Middle East, a murderous crime ring is about to trigger an international crisis.  Who can the world turn to to face this nightmare head on?  Two of the world's most notorious mercenaries team up to face this never-ending catastrophe. 
[01:29:00]  If only they could stop arguing.  Are you professional or not?  Suck my tennis cup!  He's an international superstar with an overblown ego and a really short fuse.  What don't you fucking understand?  Give me a fucking answer!  He's a drug-addicted, alcoholic, incontinent, bankrupt former wrestler with blown-out knees and a ten-inch penis. 
[01:29:30]  Stop fighting it!  If they can get along, they might just manage to save the world.  Think for one fucking second!  Keep your fucking monster!  Christian Bale.  I'm gonna fucking kick your fucking ass!  You don't shut up for a second, all right?  The Iron Sheik.  That son of a bitch!  This summer, one gets pissed off.  No!  Really easily.  No!

[01:30:00]  Pissed on and pissed off.  Coming this summer.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on SiriusXM.  Oh!  Does anybody really know what time it is?  Does anybody really care?  Oh, wow.  If so, I can't imagine why.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Got time enough to cry. 
[01:30:30]  But I was walking down the street one day.  Eh, eh, eh.  We pushed and shoved my people.  Trying to beat the clock.  Oh, no.  I just don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And I say, yeah, I say  Oh, time it is  Oh, I can't imagine why

Yeah  Some of that Watley cock  Yeah  Well, I'll worry about that when the time comes  You gotta fuck them  Here's what I hope happens  I hope they get married  Yeah  I hope Fez fucks her once  And it's really brutal and hard  And then he divorces her  Sends her out like a whore  All used up 
[01:40:30]  Thank you, Jenny  I'm happy to have your bluff  Oh, you do  I love you, Patty  But I want to see you  I want to see you at 59  Just futzing around with a cooter  With a broken seal on it  Like the back of a tractor trailer  Ah, no, someone's been rooting around in here  The seal's broke  Rooting around  Patty?  Yeah  Patty, you're gonna have sex  Well, whatever would be expected on your wedding  No, no, Patty 
[01:41:00]  That's right  No, no, no  Let's break the  Hold on, Patty  Because I know  We know you  We've been talking to you for way too long  You have to have sex with Fez  Or the marriage is off  Well, we'll let us two talk about that  You gotta do your wifely duties  You have to do your wifely duties  And if you're not gonna have sex with Fez  Then I gotta tell Ron  The wedding's off  But what about the cooking and the cleaning?  About it  You know  That's what you do after the sex  Absolutely  In the kitchen  Start rattling those pots and pans 
[01:41:30]  Start cooking while you clean out your vag with a sock  Wipe out your box with an old fucking sweat sock  Yeah  You got some lingerie for the big wedding night?  Ah, yes  Oh, that's right  What about the wedding night?  What are you gonna wear?  Oh, I don't know  I'll probably go to  The  I'll probably go to one of those shops  Oh, really?  Yeah  What shop is this?  What shop?  Home Depot Secrets  How about Vicki's Secret? 
[01:42:00]  Vicki's Secret  I'll go to that  Vicki's Secret  And with Fez  And with Fez being gay  You're gonna have to take it in the shitter  You know that, right?  No  I don't go that way  I'm sorry  He won't be able to come unless you're on your stomach  Right  Face first in a pillow  Right  You're gonna have to present your asshole to Fezzy  Not really  Yeah  That's why you should have came in today  You know, you could have practiced  That's right  We could have  Vicki helped you out 
[01:42:30]  I got almost a full rod listening to Patty  Why do you get rods with her?  I don't know  I just do sometimes  I'm just thinking about Fez pounding her dumper  And her face in a pillow  Leaving like little chiclet teeth imprints  The size of bedbugs  And you're moving in with Fez?  Well, I guess that's what's expected  Right  Patty's very dutiful  Yeah  I don't know we're done with Patty  What? 
[01:43:00]  She's having a great time  I know, obviously  She really is, yeah  Yeah, she's getting wet  She's thinking about it  Yeah  Are you guys gonna live together, you and Fez?  Oh yeah, definitely  You have to live together  Yeah  For how long are you guys gonna live together?  I don't know  Are you looking  It's not funny  Are you looking forward to getting a clam full of pud?  Whatever that is, I'm not sure  It doesn't sound good 
[01:43:30]  That could be the most unsexy thing  Holy shit  A clam full of pud  That's horrible  Patty, if Fez has trouble becoming erect  Because he's gay  What are you gonna do to get him hurt?  Oh, that's a great question  Yeah  Glad I thought of it  Yes, Patty, answer  Why don't you ask him that?  No, you would have to  No, you would have to  You would have to do something  What would be your move if you're there 
[01:44:00]  And Fez has got a limp dick  Yeah  I would kick him  I would cook him a nice meal  Oh my god  That's awful  His appetite makes the heart grow fonder  What a fucking dud  No, it doesn't  You're a dud  Distance makes the heart grow fonder  You know expression, no one fuck  Yeah  We're not talking about the heart  We're talking about the dick  Yeah  That's right  You gotta get his dick  You gotta get his dick hard  It's not a matter of, you know 
[01:44:30]  Him being your best friend  Yeah, Patty  What are you gonna do?  You're in bed  It's your wedding night  It's time to consummate the marriage  Yeah  Fez has got a fucking limp noodle  Yeah  Going on down there  So you gotta perform your wifely duties  And get that thing working  What do you do?  Go  Get it working?  Oh my god  Would you use your hand  Or just right to the mouth?  Yeah  Patty?  Yeah 
[01:45:00]  Go, what do you do?  Yeah  Come on, you're fucking  You're wasting time  Fez is laying there  He needs to be satisfied  You're his wife, for God's sake  What are you doing?  I would ask him what he wants to do  What if he wanted you to slide his PJ bottoms down  And then the only way he could get hard would be if you ate his ass and jiggled his sack  I can't do  Well, I don't do this  Would you eat your husband's asshole?  No, that's disgusting  Why?  It's fucking sex  You're in love  You're a fucking wife 
[01:45:30]  You gotta do your duties  Yeah, you're getting married  You're getting married to a gay man  You're gonna have to learn the ways of the gay  Right  Screw a pot roast  He wants his asshole licked  Right  I'm sure everything will come to me when the time comes  Will it?  No, it won't, Patty  No  Yes, it will  What if he wants to pull out and come all over your face?  Will you allow that?  Yeah  Yeah  No  Why?  Because that's disgusting  Oh  Well, what about  What kind of sex?  What kind of sex is okay?  I got one, I got one, I got one 
[01:46:00]  Oh, yes, yes  Patty, would you fist Fezzy?  Oh  No, that's stomach turning  Why is that stomach turning?  Only if you're going too deep  I'm just not something like  I'm not like that  Would you let him blow his beans up your muff?  You know, I would do everything the very, very conventional way  You know he's a  Like what?  Yeah, what is the conventional way?  What's conventional?  What's conventional to you? 
[01:46:30]  Talk us through it, Patty  Because for some people, a good fisting is conventional  Right  Patty, comment?  For me, I got to keep my voice very low  Because I'm in a crowded restaurant  With a bunch of people  It's not a restaurant  Restaurant?  Yeah  Yeah  We can't hear you  Could you put us on the speaker?  Speaker phone?  The speaker phone?  Yeah  Yeah  It would be the very conventional way 
[01:47:00]  Put us on speaker  Yeah, put us on speaker  We'll hear you better  What do you want me to do?  Okay, it would be missionary  Now, what if he wanted to  If he needed you to go down on him a little bit?  Like, if he just needed you to fucking  You wouldn't tongue his dick with your mouth?  No  Why?  I wouldn't  You're not going to suck dick?  You got to blow your mouth  It's not disgusting  You're an awful wife  She's a terrible wife already  You're a horrible wife  Yes, you are  Even for a gay guy  You are 
[01:47:30]  The fuck, man?  You don't suck dick  You don't eat ass  Gay guys long  What do you do?  Are you going to at least put a thumb in his ass?  What about a thumb?  What about some ass play, Patty?  What do you say?  Nah, I don't think so  Water sports?  Scat?  Yeah  What if he wanted to fucking play carnival cruise lines?  Where he wanted you to be a passenger  And he wanted his face to be a dick?  Patty  You're only going to lay there on your back 
[01:48:00]  While he dicks you?  That's it?  Well, you know what?  That's just the way I am  I'm sorry  No, you're not  Very conventional  You're not even that  Well, let me ask you this much  Will you have sex with Fezzy  After you're married to him?  Well, after marriage, yes  You do  The night of the marriage  You're married  Yeah  Oh my god  Fezzy has to have sex with Patty  Fezzy's got to fuck her  Film it  Somehow he's got to get that  No, it doesn't get to film  We've got to film it  Does anyone film you? 
[01:48:30]  Yes  Really?  Wow, Patty  What do you think it's going to be like?  Yeah  It'll be like we're married  Is it going to be beautiful?  Hopefully  Are you going to cry?  You think?  I don't know how I'll feel emotionally  Are you  Yeah, really  Fez is going to be crying  But you're taking this one seriously, right?  Yeah  You know, he did make an agreement  Is Fez how you envisioned your Prince Charming?  Gay and a virgin?  Yeah  You know, and I'm sure he's pretty conventional, too 
[01:49:00]  You think you're going to let him shoot his load inside you?  Yeah  Patty?  Hey  Patty?  You're going to have  Hold on  She's going to have to  Because that's part of your religion  Yeah  Yeah, you can't waste the seed  Yeah  Jesus will get mad at you  That's right, so are you guys going to do some kind of rhythm method?  Are you worried about getting pregnant?  What's going to happen here?  She's hardcore Catholic  You can't waste the seed 
[01:49:30]  Well, you see  She should be worried about getting pregnant  I don't know  58 is possible  I guess  I am past the age  So there's no way back in half  How do you know you're past the age?  We went through this a few years ago  She would tell us about her menopause  Old malted milk balls ovaries  The inside of her vagina  Is like a coffee pot that you left  And you forgot there was coffee in it  It smells like a refrigerator that hasn't been plugged in 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  Oh my god, yeah  Oh god, Patty  Patty, you've given us nothing  We're working way too hard for this shit today  I love how she says  She's sure that Fez is conventional  When Fez likes dick more than Patty does  Yeah  Yeah  Isn't that weird?  Yeah  I like it conventional with my gay husband  What's wrong with you, Patty?  It sounds like she would probably have sex with Fezzy 
[01:50:30]  That would be  She's gonna  And he could shoot up all in her  Yeah  He could fucking drop a load in that fucking disgusting mess  Would you swallow his cum, though?  Oh  Patty?  Yes  Would you swallow his cum?  No  What if he wanted to give you a gullet full of pecker juice?  I'm sorry, but no  I don't do things like that  I would grab her fucking mouth  Between my thumb and two fingers  And just press so her mouth would go  Like that  And just shove my cock in there 
[01:51:00]  Against her will  No, those dumb little  I'd face fuck her  On the pillow  As she's trying to square my fucking  And then if she don't like it  She'd get fucking smacked  Yeah  Wow  Yes  Even if she does like it  Smack her  And you'd live there with a  Fucking cooter full of cum  And two black eyes, you bitch  That's right  Jesus Christ  Jeez, what the fuck?  You'd be leaking like a fucking elephant  Stepped on a cannoli  That's how you'd be leaking out in bed  Your fucking box would just be crying  Like a big slit 
[01:51:30]  Crying white tears  Patty, what about diseases?  Well, that's one thing that I wouldn't have  But you just gotta assume Fezzy doesn't  But I don't think he does  Because I don't think he's ever had sex  So you guys are good  So you'll have  When he was making out with Paulo on the couch  Right  Paulo had giant cold sores on his lips  Yeah  Oh  I hope he gives you herpes  Oh, that'd be great  Yes  And she gets in bed  All over her face, vagina, and asshole 
[01:52:00]  Oh my god  She outbreaks every three days  Are you gonna let  Every three  Are you gonna let Fez go down on you, Patty?  Oh, Patty  Good question  I don't know  That'd be discussed  You know, anything we do  Would be as a result of love  Of course  Not just some day  You know, and love doesn't force  What the fuck is Ronnie getting into?  That's true  What the fuck's up with Ronnie?  What if he  What if love was the motivator?  Yeah  And he said, look, I'd love to flip you over 
[01:52:30]  And come in your, you know  Come where the shit comes out  What if he said, I'd love that?  Yeah  Any relationship is built on love  Ah  So, would you let him lick your asshole?  Not really  Patty, I wanna put it in your stink hole  Yeah, what if he wanted to take his cock  And play your roids like a xylophone?  I would get up and cook him a nice pot, bro  Oh, God  I'd rather fuck that, actually 
[01:53:00]  Pot roast with onions on it  Oh, yes  More exciting  Yeah  You and your dumb fucking cooking  You think that  You think he cares about cooking  When he wants to fucking shoot a load?  Yeah  Patty, do you have any fantasies?  Didn't you ever hear that the way to a man's heart  Is through the stomach?  Stop saying that  Yeah  You go in through the asshole  A blowjob's not too bad either, by the way, Patty  Patty, do you have any sexual fantasies  Of where you'd like it, like in the water  Or like on the beach or anything like that? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, where do you want Fez to make love to you for the first time?  Oh, yeah  Oh, my God  Patty?  How about in the...  Uh, I don't know  I like the idea of woods and forests  Oh  You know, with a shallow grave  You know, with nature around us  Yeah, perfect  Yes  Like the Zodiac killer  Yeah  Exactly  She wants the Green River killer to fuck her  I like the idea of leaves being thrown in my face when I'm done  Yeah, it's wonderful  Oh, out in nature 
[01:54:00]  You fucking Gollum  Yeah  There's fucking dicks in your vagina  You know, that's a nice name  If you ever have a child, that's a good name  What?  Gollum?  You know what?  We could give Patty the...  I don't like a usual name  We could give Patty the video from our gay off  Yeah  To learn about the gay  Oh, right  That's a great idea  For Fezzy  We got some video we're gonna send you  What if Fez wants to strike you about the face with his dick?  What about that?  Nice, right?  You know, I heard part of that show and I couldn't listen to all of it  I had to turn it off and go to the TV 
[01:54:30]  What part bothered you?  Yeah  What got you?  I don't know  I think that, you know, just from the, you know, the...  I can't describe it  Go ahead, describe it  One of them was facing the other and the other one was, like, frontwards  The other one was backwards  And when I got the visual of that, I had to turn it off  Wait, if one was frontwards and the other one was backwards, that means their asses were touching? 
[01:55:00]  What parts are you talking about, Patty?  Yeah  Yeah, that was weird  And I felt sorry for the wives  Yeah  You're gonna be one of those wives  Yeah, that's right  Except all voluntary gay off  Right  I hope this happens  I hope Fezzy wants to fucking fuck her in the ass or something  She's like, oh, yeah, now I gotta pull out my cooking strategy  And you make him a nice fucking meatloaf  And he pounds it up your ass with a mallet 
[01:55:30]  It's really violent today  I hope you make him a meatloaf  And he throws it out the window like Pauly and Rocky  And then fucks your shitter on the sofa  Patty, I won't sweat you  Sounds like you're gonna be a pretty shitty wife  I gotta be honest with you  Yeah  No, I'll be a very good one  No, you won't  No  You're not willing to do your sexual duties  Do your duty  Do your duty  You're gonna collapse on a feed bag in a pet store  Patty, you're a terrible wife 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, you're awful  You really are  I didn't, well, I didn't get married yet  So we don't know that  You're gonna be  Who's gonna be your maid of honor?  Oh  I don't know  Who's in the wedding party?  Well, we only have one person picked out  The one to give me away  Since I don't have parents and, you know, and all that  Yeah  So  Who's gonna give you away?  Well, Mises and Ron have decided that Opie's gonna give me away 
[01:56:30]  Oh  Do I have a say in this?  No, apparently not  Oh, that's nice  Yeah  That's nice  Really nice  That's it  So far  So  What the fuck?  Sorry  You've been elected  Everybody's gotta give her away  They got you  How do I do that?  Well, you gotta fucking  I don't know  Lift up the veil  And give her a little kiss on the cheek  Yeah  Like the dad  Legally, will I have any responsibility?  Will this backfire in my fucking face? 
[01:57:00]  I don't know  Ron came up with the idea  Of course he did  I'll get him back  Yeah, you gotta kiss her on the cheek and wish her well  Uh-huh  All the music plays  Bomp, bump, bump  Here comes the corpse  This is the dumbest thing  Where are you guys going for your honeymoon?

[02:06:30]  Yeah  But all of a sudden  Since when were mouths  Just for eating  Come on, Patty  Will you guys get into  Some dill play  As Sal calls it  Any dill play?  Are you guys gonna do  Some double dill action?  I don't have a good visual of that  Oh, boy  You got a vibrator right  Yeah  I don't use it  Because I don't  I don't use it right now  Patty  Patty  Yes  Will you do something like  Like lean over the side of the bed 
[02:07:00]  And let him  Have vaginal sex with you  But from behind  Oh, very good  Very good question  He's standing up, right?  You're laying over the side of the bed  With your ass kind of hanging over the edge of the bed  And then he's fucking you  In the vag  But from behind  Right  You allow it?  You know, that's something I've never really  Would you allow it?  Yeah, you've never done any of this stuff  Yeah, we know that you haven't done anything  Right, exactly  Out of love  Yeah, what if it's with love? 
[02:07:30]  What if he wants to bang your doggy style out of love?  Would you be up for a good ATM?  I don't know  We'll have to  Do you know what an ATM is?  No  Well, I go to one to get money once in a while  I bet you do  Oh, you prostitute  Would you be up for a good ATM from Fez?  It could take care of both your needs  Will he take me to the cash machine?  Well, no  He pops you in the shitter  And then you have to blow him afterwards 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, he pulls out of your asshole  And shoves it right in your face  It's ass to mouth, Patty  It's ass to mouth  Are you it's ass to mouth?  That doesn't sound very ladylike  Well, you're no lady  I'm a complete lady, I'm sorry  That's how I am  I'm a complete lady  You're not complete  I'm a complete lady  You're an old lady  She talks like fucking  Like it's the 20s  But she's talked like this her whole life  Yeah, exactly  She's finally getting to the age  Where it almost makes sense 
[02:08:30]  Right  She talks like this  Yeah  How about Branson, Missouri?  Maybe this is finally our Branson, Missouri trip  Oh, right  She could go to Yakov Shmirnov for your honeymoon  What do you think?  Would you like to go to Yakov's dinner adventure?  What's that?  You get to watch Yakov Shmirnov  And have some fucking vegetable medley  Yeah, the vegetable medley is to die for  And the brisket  I like Las Vegas a lot better  How do you know?  You've never been there  Well, I don't know 
[02:09:00]  With all the shows and dancing and stuff  I'm saying  With the shows and dancing and plays  Right  No one goes to a play in Las Vegas  No  You live in New York  Go to a play on Broadway  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  I want to see if mice and men  I'm not going to see that in fucking Vegas  Yeah  Patty  Wow, what a horrible fucking  What a horrible sexual encounter that'll be  Oh, Patty  I don't think so 
[02:09:30]  I think so  Will you play with his  Will you  Will you jiggle his balls a little?  I don't know  You know  I don't have  I'm not thinking about that right now  Well, you should give it some thought  Yeah, man  What's going on?  Jiggle his nuts  What's wrong with you?  Well, whatever happens  Will come naturally  Would have come naturally  He spins around  To fucking  Put that  Put that big juicy cock  Near your face  Yeah, what if he wants to 69  With you on the bottom  Yeah  And he can only come  If he punches your tits 
[02:10:00]  Jesus  Very funny  Jimmy  You're a comedian  Oh  Jimmy  Sure is  Oh, boy  Well  Answer  Patty comment  Yeah, Patty comment  Or what?  Had our laugh  No comment  All right, well  You know the only thing that comes naturally  For Fez would  Be another man  Another man, that's true  We'll see what happens 
[02:10:30]  How are you going to satisfy him like a man would?  Holy shit, yeah  You're going to have to use a strap on  Patty, you're going to have to use a strap on  You all right with that?  Patty  Not really, no  But you're willing to give it a try, right?  Out of love  Out of love  No  Why?  You want to put a strap on on for your gay husband who you love?  Yeah, man  What's wrong with you?  You got to  You got to dog him from behind  You're welcome  He wants to get a dog 
[02:11:00]  Yeah  You got to duke him up the ass  Yeah  You wouldn't duke Fez?  I don't know  I'm married  You think it'll feel good  Having sex?  Oh, I'm pretty sure  If it's based on love  It'll feel beautiful  It's not what it's based on  It's based on a radio bit  Yeah  It's based on a sham  Right  Yeah  All right, Patty  I think we're done with you  All right 
[02:11:30]  Well, you have a good morning  She's the worst  Bye, Patty  Oh, yeah  Yeah, real fast  What are you doing for the rest of the day?  Me?  Well, I'm going to go home  Take a nap  And then I want to go down to the Empire  Because I haven't been there in six weeks  And I have some comps  Excitement never stops  Well, that's it  I want to use my comps  Your comps at the Empire?  What the hell is the Empire?  I've got $35 coming to me  And I want to use it before  Well, look out 
[02:12:00]  What is the Empire?  That's that fucking place  With the slot machines  I like  Yeah, I like that place  I've been there a few times  How does she get into Yonkers?  From Staten Island?  No, no  You take the four trains  From the ferry  And you transfer it to the 21 bus  Or a taxi  It'll take you to two bus  Just to fucking  Use a $35 gift card?  She has to take a boat  To a train  To a bus  No, not a cab  To a cab  To train  A bus and a cab  To spend $35?

Let me see the lump  They call it like  Nodes or something 
[02:13:00]  Nodes  Look at it  How bad is it?  It's like an Adam's apple  On the side of her neck  Come on  Look, look  Move your finger  Oh my god  You're a guy  Oh god  Patty  I've seen that before  She's got an Adam's apple  Oh man  Good luck, bro  Well I have  Every two months  I gotta take  Three needles  In that area  The first needle  I feel  Because they numb  Everything with it  And then the other two  They take the cells up  To make sure 
[02:13:30]  They're not  Malignant  So far  They're fine  They're not malignant  Why don't they  Hack it out?  Yeah, can you take  That shit out?  You know what?  In about a year or so  If it's still growing  They will operate  And take it out  And I'll be on medication  For the rest of my life  What kind of medicine?  Thyroid medicine  All right  Don't yell at me  Geez, yeah, Patty  We're concerned  I just watched my diet  And everything  And I'll  She's got the thyroid  Yeah, well  It's something they say  That happens to a lot of people 
[02:14:00]  My age  Right  My age  My age  Oh god  It always puts the accent  On the wrong syllable  Yeah  You shoehorn words  When you talk  Just giggles  Oh my god  All right, Patty  Good luck at Empire  Okay, I hope I win  That looks like a marble bag  Jesus Christ  Holy shit, Patty  All right

[02:17:30]  Thank you guys for having me  No problem  Thanks for being here  I am Ben Lyons on Twitter  Hey, what's up?  I was looking at the camera  Oh  Yeah  Oh, what's up?  I'm good  Ben Lyons  I guess I come recommended from DJ Who Kid  Is that true?  You guys are pals, right?  Is that how I ended up here?  I don't know  Yeah, that's right, Nicole  How do you know DJ Who Kid?  He's a good egg  We share a lot of moisture together  Moisture?  Yeah  No, I just know  He likes the moisture 
[02:18:00]  Come by and hang out in the shower  Yeah, DJ Who Kid  We love him, man  We absolutely love the guy  He doesn't  One of the most ridiculous people on the  Yeah, he doesn't understand laws  But we love him  No, he doesn't  He got arrested  He's doing alright, though  Yeah  Yeah  What did he get arrested for?  Suspended license  Not one  Which is so soft  17  So soft for a hip-hop dude  It really is  It's not soft  Because he's had what?  17?  No  It's nine suspended licenses  And I talked to the  How is that even possible?  I don't know  My buddy  Wait, does that mean you get a license  Then you lose it 
[02:18:30]  Then you have to start all over again  Then you lose it  Well, I asked him  I was like  So what, did they just take your license  And then they were like  There's nine suspensions on it  And he was like  No, I don't have a license, man  They could suspend your non-existent license  Yeah, they took it away from him  And then each time you get  Subsequent violation  Oh, I gotcha  It's another suspended license  And my buddy talked to the arresting officer  Yeah  He said one more license suspension  And it's a felony  So is he going to get a license finally?  No, I don't think so  He's going to wind up  He's going to wind up doing hard time 
[02:19:00]  He DJ'd in Jordan once  And didn't have a passport  And had his crunch fitness card  And that's how he got into the country  The little crunch card king  I was like  Yo, the prince of Jordan  The little crunch card  He loves units  Why wouldn't he get a driver's license?  And does he have car insurance?  I don't know if he has car insurance  He's been driving to it  Holy fuck  From Jersey to New York  For like  13 years without a license  Wouldn't that put a lot of stress on your heart  Knowing that  Going through the tunnel without a license?  Without a license 
[02:19:30]  No car insurance  He once drove through Times Square  In a Lamborghini  Filming a video with Bow Wow  While he was driving  He had no driver's license  Wow  Sounds like a must-see video  I should download that right now  Wow  That is a must-see  Really creative  Wow  Damn  Love him  Where is he now?  He's in Dubai or something?  Obviously  Yeah  Dubai  Yeah  You do more than movies now, Ben  I see you all over the place  I'm working a lot with the Knicks these days  Which has been fun 
[02:20:00]  Thus then the Knicks hat  Well, I'm just a Knicks fan  So  I can't get into Carmelo Anthony  Why?  I don't know  I know he's a great player  But I just don't like him  I don't know  He's kind of a ball hog at times  When we need him the most  Who's going to pass you?  Pablo Pergioni?  True  Come on  You know why Carmelo's shooting 25 times a night?  Well, do you think that'll get us a championship, though?  That's the question  A championship?  No, listen  I grew up here in New York  We're not going to get a championship with Carmelo Anthony  I'm telling you right now  I used to live across the street when they had Howard Isley, Michael Doliak 
[02:20:30]  And they were awful  Right  And so the fact that they're even in the conversation for a championship  Sure  For the playoffs  I'm good  Fair enough  It's an all-star break  They won 30-something games  I'm good  Fair enough  Fair enough  He's right  I have no idea about basketball  I was about to say  Jump in  I'm terrible with basketball  I was one of those guys  I went away  I wasn't a Knicks fan for a long time  And then Jeremy Lin  I was one of those guys  I came back  So for two weeks  For that nonsense  No, then I've been kind of taking a look ever since 
[02:21:00]  But I don't know  I don't know what it is with Carmelo Anthony  It's more Amari for me that I have problems with  Really?  He seems a little too into Fashion Week  And he seems a little too into Instagram  Amari Stoudemire  Yeah  He's a little distracted in New York  You like Novak?  Of course I love Novak  Novak  First of all  Not that many white American players in the NBA these days  Right?  A lot of guys from Russia  Sure  Yugoslavia  Nice white American player  Go Novak  I love how he can only play within 10 feet on the court 
[02:21:30]  When the Knicks have the ball  And he just shuffles back and forth within this 10-foot area  Hoping to get the ball  Because he shoots the threes  He shoots the trays  There's nobody  I can't think of another profession  Where you can only be good at the smallest part of that profession  And make a great living doing it  He can't do anything else  Right  And he'll never  He'll  Will just stay in his area the entire time the Knicks have the ball  That sounds like a good gig  He can't do anything else really  Yeah  That sounds like a good gig  It's fun to go to the Knick game, right? 
[02:22:00]  You like going to the Garden?  I've never  Let me tell you the last basketball game I went to  Okay  It was  Walt Frazier?  The ABA  No  Yes  It was the ABA  And I saw Rick Barry play  Nice  Yeah  With the red, white, and blue ball  Underhand free throw  Underhand free throw  Rick Barry  Golden State Warriors?  No  Rick Barry?  No  He was on  Oh, you said ABA?  Yeah  What was the New York team in the ABA?  Oh, he played for the Nets? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah  I think he was  I feel like you were going to tell me you were an extra in the Fish Save Pittsburgh or something  I once saw the Nets play the San Diego Conquistadors  Conquistadors?  That was an ABA team  Wow  That was a little  That sounds like a team in the movie Semi-Pro  Yeah  Yeah, that's what they were going for with that Semi-Pro  What a terrible name for a team  That was their name in the ABA  Conquistadors  Conquistadors  You can't even really get them on a shirt 
[02:23:00]  Just to support the team  Or the cheerleaders dress in  I swear to you, I was really small  I was very, very young when that happened  So I barely remember it  But I do know I went  What are you doing for the Knicks?  I do some stuff for KnicksNow.com  Nice  Which is their fan site  Do interviews for them  And actually they had me at the Knick game on Wednesday night  As part of the 7th Avenue squad  Which is the guys who run on the court during the game  With the t-shirt guns  So I did that on Wednesday night  And I really thought I was playing in the game  I was sweating intensely 
[02:23:30]  I was running out there  Just throwing the shirts as far as I could  Feeling like a pro  So that's up on KnicksNow.com  So yeah, it's really cool  So you're just doing whatever?  Yeah, a little bit of whatever  Oh, that's kind of cool  Doing some Oscar stuff next week  Nice  Working on that hard-hitting show Extra  With Mario Lopez  That's right  I've seen you on there a few times  I'm sorry to hear that  No, it's a good show  It's a lot of fun  Are you kidding me?  That's a great gig  Yeah, it's been really cool  And so yeah, a little bit of this  A little bit of that  What do you think is going to win Best Picture? 
[02:24:00]  What should win or what will win?  Both  For me, my favorite movie of the year  Was Beasts of the Southern Wild  I don't know if you guys had a chance to see that  Which one is next?  Is that with the little girl?  Little girl  About a family that's displaced during a natural disaster  And they're trying to survive off the land  And it's directed by Ben Zeitlin  Who's 27 and got a Best Director nom  Which doesn't happen too often  That was my favorite  I think Argo will win  It seems like  Best Picture  They won the BAFTAs  They won the SAGs  They won the Globe  It just seems like it has this momentum behind it 
[02:24:30]  I still haven't seen it  You know why they're doing so well in Argo?  Here's why  Because it makes Hollywood look like they're saving the world  Because there's a big producer in the movie  They show Hollywood's part in this fake movie production thing  Played by Alan Arkin  Yes  It was a made up character  But it still shows Hollywood as being the hero  These douches are rewarding themselves  Argo is very good  There's also no other business that publicly congratulates itself 
[02:25:00]  As often as Hollywood does  It seems like every weekend for three months there's an award show  We have to suffer through an Anne Hathaway speech every weekend  Did you like Argo?  I did very much  Yeah I think anytime there's a movie where you know the outcome  Yet it's still suspenseful  And you're on the edge  That's like a tremendous accomplishment I think  I thought Django Unchained was much better  I definitely prefer that  Because it was  Well that's too edgy right for  Yeah  Best Picture nom  And Christoph Waltz  That's true  It'll probably win screenplay again for Tarantino I think 
[02:25:30]  Right  I mean that movie's awesome because  It's epic with just writing and character structure and scene structure and all that shit  It's really cool how well it's done  Without special effects and CGI and all that stuff  Tarantino's great  We had him in here again  We love when he comes by  Fucking bearded Ben Affleck  Director Ben Affleck is annoying the piss out of me  You can't get into that  Everywhere with the beard  I know he had it in the movie  But it's like  Now he's just wearing it  Because directors have the beard  He's just playing the part  That scruffy art auteur 
[02:26:00]  Yes  You want clean shaven Affleck  Yes  From Jiggly  Yeah where's the Jiggly  You want reindeer games Affleck  Exactly  Exactly  Don't  You're not fucking fooling me  Hope floats  That's what you want  Yeah  Hope floats  That's it  Did you like Silver Lining Playbook?  I did  Yeah  I think you know  With the four of them being nominated  Which is pretty remarkable  Someone's got to go home with an Oscar  Right  I think it's probably going to be Jennifer Lawrence 
[02:26:30]  And hopefully De Niro  I mean this is the first time in a long time  You thought his performance was that good?  No but when I look at the other performances in that category  Right  Who's he up against?  He's up against Christoph Waltz and Django  Which is really more of like a lead  It feels like  Than a supporting role  Yeah  But all he got supporting?  Yeah  There's no whole thing  Alan Arkin  Philip Seymour Hoffman  For the master  Which I didn't see actually  Has De Niro won any awards  I think it's still going on  Leading up to this yet?  Has De Niro won any awards leading up to this? 
[02:27:00]  I mean in this season  No  I don't think so  Yeah I don't think he's going to get it  I didn't think he was  He was alright  To see him cry on Katie Cork  Was an interesting perspective  It obviously affected him  But I thought the movie was okay  At best  That storyline  With a big dance contest  That's what kind of lost me  Holy shit  Who cares?  Jennifer Lawrence  Cures mental illness  Yeah  It was kind of dumb  It seems like every year now  Though there's one story  About an American family  That has issues  Whether it's The Fighter  Or The Kids Are Alright  It seems like that's the trend now 
[02:27:30]  With ten films being nominated  They love trends  To have that one family story  Of an American family  Going through some stuff  I was surprised how good of an actor  Bradley Cooper really is  He was very good  He was very good  But it was cheesy  The whole storyline  I didn't buy any of it  I didn't care about any of it  I got the relationship  Between the father and son  I kind of liked  But Jennifer Lawrence  Was great to look at  She was very good  I grew up in a family  Where sports was a big deal  My father's a crazy  Boston Red Sox fan  I left my high school  Graduation early  Because Pedro was pitching 
[02:28:00]  Really?  He's just a crazy  Red Sox fan  So I kind of  I guess identify  With that relationship  Between Bradley Cooper  And De Niro  A little bit  Well what's his name  On the Yankees  And he's basically saying  I'll always be a Red Sox  It's the back page  Of the sports section  Who's that  Johnny Dane  No  Currently on the Yankees  Kevin Uklis  Oh Kevin Uklis  Thank you  He was a big Red Sox  Right?  Yeah  But he's like  They're basically  The Yankees organization  Is trying to tell him  To shut the fuck up  Because he's telling everyone  Look you know  This is what players do  You know 
[02:28:30]  They do play for other teams  But my heart will always be  A Red Sox  He says that now  But once he starts  Getting blown in New York  And he fucking sees  What New York  Forget Boston  You know what Uklis  When the check clears  From the Yankees  You'll be just fine  Yeah he won't be  Saying that shit  You'll be totally fine  I wonder  I think that you're right  Argo will probably win  Best Picture  Oh the other supporting actor  Is Tommy Lee Jones  In Lincoln  Who's won a few awards  I have not seen  I'm way behind on movies  He was good  I have to admit  He was good  Did he like Lincoln?  I respected it 
[02:29:00]  I didn't really enjoy it  He was really slow  I'm never going to be  In a state of mind  Where I'm like  Hey Jim what are you guys  Doing on Friday night  You want to come over  And watch Lincoln?  I'm going to watch it again  What was wrong with that?  We'll watch  There Will Be Blood  Afterwards  Yeah it's just  Too slow  It's too slow  And it seems like  A lot of people  Obviously wanted to work  With Spielberg  And be a part of it  And some of the casting choices  Really take you out of the moment  It looks like a lot of people  Are playing 1800s  For Halloween  I felt like  Is that James Spann  Is that Joseph Gordon  It kind of just takes you out of it  That was it 
[02:29:30]  Like when I saw D-Day  I saw D-Day from Animal House  I'm like  Hey fuck  Look at him  He's wearing a little  White powdery wig  But that's D-Day  That's D-Day  It's amazing though  It's incredible  I mean people kind of  Take it for granted  At this point  But when you really think about it  What he's able to do  Every time out  It's really remarkable  Is he not winning anything?  Has he won nothing?  He won everything  Oh he has won everything  Yeah he's won the Sags  And won the Globes  And critics  And everything  And Spielberg is being nominated  But not winning right?  I think he'll probably win  I don't know how you vote  Against Spielberg  For Best Director this year 
[02:30:00]  Especially without Affleck  Or Catherine Bigelow  Or Tarantino nominated  None of them are nominated?  No it's not a strange category  Tarantino didn't even get nominated  For Best Director  I fucking hate the Oscars man  Oh they're terrible  That's ridiculous  What about Zero Dark Thirty?  Zero Dark Thirty  I just got my copy  From Justin Stengel man  I'm going to be fucking  Making copies of that shit  I should  Giving them to everybody  Because his name's on the disc  They like that  He's actually really paranoid  That I'm going to do that  I'm a big fan of Jessica Chastain  I think she deserves  To win the Oscar  I think like I said 
[02:30:30]  Jennifer Lawrence will win it  Again another movie  Where you know  They're going to get Bin Laden  In the end  But yet it's still suspenseful  That last 30 minutes  Fuck thanks man  Yeah sorry  Hey Lincoln  Don't go to the theater  But yeah  I like Zero Dark Thirty a lot  I mean it's three hours  It's an investment  That was pretty good  That's a three hour movie too  Everything this year  Seems to be good  Yeah yeah  I liked it though  I liked  It wasn't non-stop action  Kind of a thing  It was a lot of  You know  Kind of thriller  And you know what's great too  In the last 30 minutes 
[02:31:00]  When they're going on the raid  To get Bin Laden  It's nice in a movie  To see a Navy SEAL raid  That isn't like Michael Bay  Shooting it  It isn't just like  A huge music video  It's like  The door doesn't come off  The hinges  The helicopter crashes  Like shit goes wrong  Yeah yeah yeah  No music right  No music  Like it's just  Oh that's right  As it really happened  Which I thought was cool  You don't see that too often  Where do you do your movie reviews  Because I gotta  Start reading your shit  You just turned me out  To your reviews  I work on YouTube 
[02:31:30]  On a network called Cinefix  So my reviews are up there  And my reviews are on Extra  On TV every once in a while  And yeah  A little bit everywhere  And on the Hollywood shuffle  With DJ Who Kid  Nice  Hollywood  Hollywood  Kid  Prestigious  Home for cinephiles  Yeah kid  How did they give it to De Niro  Over Christoph Waltz  I just don't understand  How Christoph Waltz  Is a supporting role  I mean  In every scene of that movie  It feels like he's the guy  Yeah  That movie was just a tad too long  He has a very good chance 
[02:32:00]  To win again  Did Sam Jackson get nominated  For supporting?  No  And it's the best work  In many years for Sam Jackson  He was so hateable  In that movie  How did he not get nominated?  He was great  For me supporting characters  Are the guys who come into a movie  And the movie goes another direction  It just changes the tone of the movie  Right  And that's what happens  When Sam Jackson  Comes on screen in that film  De Niro  He had a good performance  I wasn't blown away  By his performance  No  It was okay  It was fine  It was fine  And you know  He didn't suck obviously  I like how you're  It wasn't anything special 
[02:32:30]  It was amazing  It was a little too long  Man  I don't mind a three hour  Fucking movie  And shit like that  But that one  I found myself going like  Alright  Let's get to the  We know what's going to happen  At the end of this thing  You know  It just seemed to go on  A little too long  Yeah  I did love Django  I love how  I wonder  Did you guys ask  Sarantino  How the fuck he decided  To choose Don Johnson  To do that  Yes  He always does that shit  It's unbelievable  The way he's able to  Resurrect guys' careers  He defended it big time 
[02:33:00]  Saying look  This guy really does  Know how to act  Yeah  He was in some cheesy stuff  But it doesn't take away  From the fact that  He's a great actor  He pulled Michael Parks  Out of nowhere  Walter Cougan  Yeah  John Travolta  Of course  He does such a good job  With casting people  That you would never expect  I think he said  He was a big fan  Of Don Johnson  And he wanted to do something  I forget how  But we did ask him that  And I forget what  His explanation was  But it was like  Typical Tarantino  Just take a shot  On something  And see if it works  Yeah  He makes a lot of good gambles  How's working on Extra? 
[02:33:30]  Extra  It's a lot of fun  We should have The Grove  Which is out in LA  Which is Times Square  In LA essentially  Which is kind of strange  But it's a good time  And it's funny  Every time there's a Super  Every year there's a Super Bowl  The hosts always make a bet  And somehow the result is  They have to show off  Their amazing bodies  I don't know  Oh Maria  You lost the Super Bowl bet  You have to stand in Times Square  In a bikini  It feels so bad  No it's cool  And I worked in the E! Channel  For about six years  Which was  That was kind of my first gig  And it was really awesome 
[02:34:00]  We like how those shows  Are pretty much  Just a tease  For the next tease  That's what I wanted to say  They don't get anything done  It's a segment  But it's like  Why do they always  Tease something  That never happens  Yeah  Or it happens  As the credits are rolling  And it's like a mention  It's like a quick  One-off little mention  But they teased  Oh my god  See right  It's like oh  Poor Mario  Boy that's a tough gig  He obviously works on his body  Twelve hours a day  So of course he wants to show it off  He'd look the same for 25 years  Did he go to the gym? 
[02:34:30]  It would be a good bet  If one of us had to do that  Yeah  It's a good time man  Why are you fucking zooming in  On his pecs there?  Sam  What's that about?  Sam  Oh now you want to look at his ball bag  I see  Sam  No no no  What's the fucking ruling now?  Come on  Getting the gay out  We've been through this  Yeah no more gay  Get carried away  We got really gay in here Ben  I heard  Really  I mean  Was it gay off or what was it?  Yeah  We were all deeply affected by it  I heard that's cool  Bunch of men being men  Men being men  A lot of men-ergy in the room 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  I can feel it  It's all good  Exactly  We got to take a break  Because we got Modest Yahoo coming  Yes  He was really good  In a random Jeffrey Dean Morgan  Horror movie from this summer  He was in it with  What's Kevin Bacon's like?  Kira Cedric  Right  And Modest Yahoo acted  In the third act  No kidding  Yeah he was really good in that  This summer  I forget the name of the movie  It was a weird, strange, scary movie  From August  He's going to play for us  If you want to stick around  Alright sure  Alright we got Ben Lyons  Ben Laden  Ben Lyons  Oh that's different 
[02:35:30]  Ben Laden and Modest Yahoo  There you go  That's a match rate in heaven  Oh my god  I am Ben Lyons on Twitter  We'll continue in just a bit  Stay there  Series XM  This is the O.P. and Anthony show  Show  Show  Show  Show  Show  Kind of nervous  I'm a big fan of Modest Yahoo  And they're in studio  Setting up to play some songs for us  Jimmy met you guys the other night  And this is how this came about  Yeah  On the  Artie Lang show  Artie Lang show 
[02:36:00]  That's right  It was an awkward introduction  Because he introduced you  To the Jewish rapper  He made something very funny  Out of it though  Oh he was so awesome  Yeah  So funny  He went off  He went off on that guy  He killed his producer for it  Yeah  Really  Because he told him  He's the Jewish rapper  But it's weird how you get like  Pegged as something  And that's just what people call you  But it was good that when he  When he asked you if you liked that  Being introduced like that  You were like no  Like I like that you were honest  You didn't just go  Oh that's fine  You know  You're like  I don't really like it  He's a little more than that 
[02:36:30]  That's for sure  Yeah  Yeah  Where were you guys gigging last night?  We were in  Damn  Where the hell were we?  Asbury Park  Asbury Park  No kidding  Yeah so you guys haven't slept yet  Um not  Barely  Yeah  How long have you been singing?  Uh about 10 years  What is your background?  You like  You were very religious  Your family was very religious  And then you kind of rebelled a little bit  Well I went to  I grew up not really so religious in New York  And um  And then when I was about 20 years old 
[02:37:00]  I became religious  And moved to Crown Heights  And lived in Brooklyn for like 10 years  That's hardcore  Crown Heights  Don't they sleep  They all have like balconies  So they can sleep  What's the holiday where  We're uh  Balconies  Oh that's uh  It's the coast  Yeah  What is that exactly?  That's when  When the Jews left Egypt  They were traveling through the desert  In these little um  Like shack type things  It was like tents or whatever  So  That holiday  Everyone's sleeping  Sleeping in them  Sleeping, eating  All their meals  In their tents  Hanging out in these little tents 
[02:37:30]  It's like the holiday of booths  It's called  The holiday of booths  The holiday of booths  Yeah they build all sorts of structures  In our neighborhood  They do?  Yeah  At the synagogue up the street from us  Wait  Which neighborhood  Upper west side  Okay  Yeah they put the whole backyard  As they get  They get all sorts of plywood  And all sorts of things  Yeah  What made you do that  When you were 20?  Like you think  As you're a kid  You're religious  And then you  And then you rebel  Around 20  Yeah  No I kind of  I kind of went the other way  I kind of was 
[02:38:00]  Ready to try out  A different style of living  A different style of life  Were you messing things up  Like when you were a teenager?  Pretty much yeah  I was screwing up a little bit  And um  And I was looking for  The structure  The rules  The rules and the structure  To just help me  Get grounded  And figure out  You know  How I was going to move forward  With my music  And everything like that  So where are you at now  With your religion?  Um  Well  Some  Some  Like big part of me  Because  I spent so much time 
[02:38:30]  And  And energy  In that community  And you know  Studying  And  And  And  And I  And I figured out  You know  A lot of things  That really  Jive with my philosophy  And the way  My outlook on life  And I used a lot of that  To inspire me  So  It's a big part  Of who I am  Sure  Today  You know  Were you always into music?  Like who were your  Musical influences  Growing up?  Damn is that a good question  I would imagine all types  I would imagine all types  Of stuff  Oh fuck  Yeah I grew up listening 
[02:39:00]  To mostly  I guess around the house  Classic rock  And  Um  Name some bands  Please  Well like Fleetwood Mac  And uh  Crosby, Stills and Nash  And Grateful Dead  And um  And then like  Artists like Tracy Chapman  And Ricky Lee Jones  That's the music  My parents listen to  Didn't you go out  And like follow Fish?  I did  Yeah  Yeah  I dropped out of high school  Nice  Nice  Yeah I got  That's a check  Got a check  Next to that one  How long were you 
[02:39:30]  On the road with that?  Uh  It wasn't that long  It was about six months  That's a long time  Hiking around the country  I think that's awesome  Pocket full of change  Right on  And a drum  Yeah  That sounds cool  What were you doing  Just kind of getting high  And going to shows?  Yeah  I just  You know  When I was in high school  When I was about 16  Shh  No they can talk  I don't  I don't  I don't  I don't know  I don't care  You don't mind  No  If you care  We don't care  But um  Yeah  When I was  When I was about 16 
[02:40:00]  Or so  Yeah they don't give a shit  They just like  We don't care  Um  What did I do?  Oh yeah  So uh  I loved the music  I was really a big fan  Of that music  And um  I don't know  I just  That summer  I just  I went to some shows  And I just said  If I feel like I need to  I don't care  I'll leave my house  With nothing  And that's what I did  I was 17  I left the house  With a  Literally a  Ziploc bag  Full of quarters  How'd you make the money 
[02:40:30]  On the road?  You know  Figured out things  Figured out ways  I hear you  I mean the first stop  I went to  Was Burlington, Vermont  And um  I had no place to stay  Some guy I had met  Earlier in the year  Said come stay with me  And I got a house up there  So it turned out  He just was like  Crashing in some  College kid's house  He had a room  And um  I met a guy  Who blew glass pipes  Just that day  And needed a place  To do it  And they had a garage  So I set the two of them up  Oh nice  A little wheeling and dealing 
[02:41:00]  So I would get  These suitcases of glass  And I'd go up to the college  And try and sell them  Right  And then I'd usually  Break them  And the guy  He'd get mad  How about the girls  What kind of girls  Would you meet on the road  Doing that  Because I always feel  Like girls  Go to like dead  Or fish shows  Like just real free whaling  And they're  Oh they're fun  Yeah  Yeah they're awesome  They really are  I like hippie girls  I don't know why  I like the free spirit  There's something  Yeah I kind of go back  Like I like girls  Who like shave their pussies  And stuff  But there's something sexy  About a girl  Who doesn't shave under her arms  I don't know 
[02:41:30]  There's something really fucking  He likes the underarm smell  At times I do man  Yeah not always  He really enjoys a gamey one  Every once in a while  Yeah that holds a real attraction  For me  That whole fucking  I don't know if we're gonna  Are we gonna insult you  With this type of talk  No no  I don't know where the line  By the last comment  But you know  You were taking it back  Right  Just for a second  A little bit  Well it's weird to hear it on radio  Yeah I remembered where I am  Yeah satellite radio  Right  Oh you're not taking it back  By the subject though  No  Okay I gotcha  No cause I think  He's really religious now 
[02:42:00]  I've got tough  Tough skin at this point  Yeah  No I'm just a little confused  That's all  Yeah I can't help it  I'm as creepy as they come  But that is true  That kind of always attracted me  To that scene  The music I don't love  Like Fish or the Dead  I loved the Dead  For a while there  But it seems like a fun way  To kind of hang out  And meet people  I went to a lot of Dead shows  And just a lot  More fun in the parking lot  Oh  You almost didn't want  To go into the show  Yes  And that's why I asked you  How you made your money  Cause that always fascinated me  There were people just  Selling plates of spaghetti 
[02:42:30]  For five dollars a pop  And that's how they made  Their money to get  To the next show  And people would just  Line up to get their  Plate of spaghetti  Yeah  Yeah  Crilled cheese sandwich  All that shit  Yeah  And there's a photo of you too  With a very kind of  An orthodox look  Was that something you  You just  When you got into the religion  You said I want to look  A certain way  And then you did  And then you just  Got tired of it  Or what made you  Kind of go back  I always  I always kind of  Took on the look  Of what I was into  So like  Yeah  When I got into Judaism  I just went for the whole thing  And then 
[02:43:00]  And then I guess  Over time  I just kind of  I felt  I guess I felt  At a certain point  I couldn't really  I was held to it  Like I had to keep it  I felt pressure  I had to have the beard  But ten years  Of the beard  Is a long time  Right  So I just felt  I'm like  How did it feel  How did it feel  The first day you shaved it  It felt weird  It felt weird  Did it feel naked  Or did it feel awesome  It felt weird at first  Like seeing my face  It felt strange  But  Yeah  But then yeah 
[02:43:30]  That felt good  What do they think of you  In Crown Heights these days  I haven't been back  Oh really  My friends keep trying  To get me to go back  For this thing or that thing  And I'm like  I'm not going back  Are you just scared  Or you just  You're done with that  Part of your life  Or  You know  I don't know  I lived there  We moved to LA  And there's just something  About the neighborhood  That's not calling me back  Right  It's like  It's a tough place  There's a lot of judgment  But there's a lot of  Great people there too  And I had a lot of  Good friends  That were supportive 
[02:44:00]  Regardless  You know  But you still have to  It's like living  It's like being on  Sesame Street  Or something  It's like everybody  Everybody knows you  Everybody's right there  Everyone's doing  The same thing  It's not typical  To have communities  Like that anymore  Not at all  Did you meet  Were you dating there too  Were you kind of set up  To be married  Or how is it  When you're dating  In a very strict religion  Is it a lot different  Yeah  I was really  I was really cut off  From that whole thing  I didn't speak with girls 
[02:44:30]  I didn't talk to girls  You know  Nothing  No TV  No nothing  I didn't wear my glasses  When I walked in the street  So I wouldn't  See the billboards  I was really  Not distracted  I just stayed  Totally  Undistracted  Completely  So then  And then at a certain point  I started doing my music  And rabbis  You know  Oh you should get married  So I met a girl  Got married  Oh you did  Yeah  And you still married  Or no  Yeah  Oh okay 
[02:45:00]  So it worked out  Still married with three boys  Oh okay  Good for you  So it worked out  Yeah  It worked out  Is she happy with your choice  That you kind of  Pulled back a little bit  From  Nah  I mean  She's cool  She doesn't really care too much  As long as I'm  I guess a good husband  She's okay with it  She's okay  What a fascinating story  Yeah  I'm always  I'm always interested  Because like  You know  I always hated going to church  When I was a kid  And I'm always interested  In somebody who makes a decision  To kind of be more involved 
[02:45:30]  In  Like whatever the religion is  Whether it's  Christian or Judaism  If we're asking questions  You don't want to answer  Please let us know  But  So  How religious are you now?  It's hard for me to define it right now  Because my religion isn't really like  As definable as it was at that point  It was a very clear cut for me  You've pulled back  But you're still  A religious man  I mean yeah  Still very much  Feeding off of it  Right  But it's just  More  The relationship is different  I guess  It's more 
[02:46:00]  Based on the inspiration  Right  About the guilt  And you know  What I'm supposed to do  Or not supposed to do  Right  Gotcha  Were you in Crown Heights  During the riots?  No  Oh yeah  Before my time  Okay  Because it's a very  Very  Again  It must be weird to be  In any neighborhood  Where everybody is very  Very focused on the same  Thing  You know  Whether it's an Irish neighborhood  Or whatever  And it's like  If you kind of go away from that  You stand out  Yeah  If you pull back your  And everybody knows  The minute you pull back  Everybody knows  That you've done that 
[02:46:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  But it's a whole  It's a whole  Interesting world over there  Because you know  There was  The big inspiration over there  Was the rabbi  The Rebbe  The Menachem Shnierson  And he  He passed away  Several years ago  So there's already  A generation growing up  Without the leadership  Role there  And a lot of  Confusion as to  Like what direction  To go in  You know  Because people want  They want to be like  Connected  Relate to the world  But then they've got this  Intense history  And culture of  You know Jews 
[02:47:00]  That were escaping Russia  Their grandparents  Were sneaking out of Russia  And going to Siberia  And you know  All that kind of stuff  So there's that  Mixture between the modern day  And then this  Traditional culture  Which is  Which is cool  Because you know  You get to see  This different take  On the world  Than you're used to seeing  You know  Have you played Israel?  Oh yeah  Yeah many times  Oh really?  I don't know  I'd be scared to go  Like you know  Which is kind of irrational  Because you always feel like  Oh  It feels like  Nowhere there is safe  But everybody I know 
[02:47:30]  That goes  Loves it  And they say  Oh yeah  People are great  And you don't feel like  Menaced  You know  I'm always afraid  You're going to feel like  Threatened wherever you go  But yeah  No no  It's like an awesome country  It's beautiful  It's fun  People are awesome  Everyone's out  Playing volleyball  And stuff  I mean  They're not worried about  All the missiles  That are pointed at them  Did you have anything  Happen over there?  Um  No I've never really  Had any issues over there  One time I freaked out  But I was more  My own paranoia  Um 
[02:48:00]  We were like  Going into the old city  And if you go around  This one way  It becomes East Jerusalem  Which is you know  Jews aren't really  Welcome there  So much  So  I thought  The taxi driver  Was taking me  To  East Jerusalem  Wow  Neighborhood  I figured  He like  Figured out who I was  And they were going to  You know  Kidnap me  Wow  I had a whole  Like paranoid plan  And I jumped out  Of a moving taxi  Did you really?  But yeah  That was just my own  I mean  He was just going around  The back way 
[02:48:30]  It was like a faster way  Wait  Well how do you know that?  Did he stop and tell you that?  Or did he just keep going?  No no no no  He  I realized after  Like another time  I went with a friend  And the taxi driver  Took the same route  That's the route  That you go  Oh okay  When you're going there  But I was like  This guy's taking me in  I'm like  Jumping out of the taxi  Like running up  A one way street  The wrong way  Did he tuck and roll  At least?  Yeah  How fast was the car going?  No I wasn't going fast  He probably thought  You just beat him  For the fair  He probably just  Yeah we were right  Like  Damn 
[02:49:00]  Jew  Yeah you're thinking  You're being fucking  You know kidnapped  And he thinks  You're beating the fair  And you're both wrong  I just looked down  At our one sheet  Which we haven't  Really used here yet  But in June  June of 2012  You dyed your hair blonde  And that got people  To talking again  Huh?  Yeah  Maybe that wasn't  The best move  That particular time  Yeah  But uh  What was that about?  We were going to make  A video in Israel  And I wanted to have  That like  Desert look  Right  So I just 
[02:49:30]  Decided to dye my hair  It created a bit  Of a stir  Yeah but it didn't  It didn't really mix well  No  I could imagine  Ease  Right  Ease them into  Transition  How was it when you  Travel there like  What do you fly  LL or do you fly  An American airline  LL usually  I heard they're rough  Like uh  I kind of  I respect that airline  Cause there's always  They're always so  Worried  But I heard  They don't  They don't care  About hurting your feelings  Or whatever  Like they  They will pull anybody aside  And talk to you  For as long as they feel  They need to  Like they really  Oh yeah  They really fucking  They're very  Very strict with security 
[02:50:00]  Oh yeah  Yeah I remember  That's good right  Taking my band over there  Like many times  And them  Giving the band  The rundown  Like what are you  Doing over here  It was  It was hard for  Israel to wrap  Their head around me  For a minute  It was like  He's so acidic  But he  You're traveling  With these musicians  They're trying to  Put it  Put it together  Did they think  Something was up  Or no  Well yeah  My name was on a list  Also for a while  Matthew Miller  A different Matthew Miller  Born in the same year  He was like 
[02:50:30]  I don't know  Probably doing drugs  Or something  Oh is that  Is that your  That's your  Yeah so for a while  I was on a list  So anytime I'd go there  I was like  Put in a room  With all the Arabs  So Matthew Miller  Is your real name  Yeah  Oh I didn't know that  Okay  And how did you  Pick the name  Matissev  That's my Hebrew name  Okay  Yeah  Which you chose later  Or was that what you  Yeah I chose  When I became religious  I felt there was  More meaning to it  And I  I went with that  Okay  Does it mean anything  Yeah it means 
[02:51:00]  Gift from God  You know  Boy he picked a good one  Yeah  That's a good one  Yeah you don't want  To pick one  That doesn't mean much  Yeah right  It means  It's rock in the sun  Right  Might as well go  For a really good one  Yeah  Gift from God  Is high up on the ladder  Yeah I don't think  You can go much higher  Than that one  I would love to hear  You guys play  Absolutely  Alright cool  I hear you guys  Are going to play  A couple songs for us  Yeah  It's very cool  And you're on tour now  It's called An Acoustic Evening  With  Jesus

[02:54:00]  Through this kingdom of time  Thus far I've done  Lost my mind  Only to find  The other side  Where the world opens wide  Through desolate city streets  Late at night  I've been searching for my mind  They say I aspire  But I'm still looking for my fire  These lies have got me tired 
[02:54:30]  I'm done stalling  I'm free falling  I'm done climbing up this mountain top  I won't stop  Till I manifest my crop  The top is closed  The sky's scraping  They stay chasing  I'm like a raisin in the sun  Running from death's invasion  It done I'm going grey  I'm still young  Having mystic visions of the one 
[02:55:00]  I hear the horn  The melody comes  Rushing in like some wind  Cuts close like a knife  All I got is my life  All I got is my life  Yeah  Cause loads  One million miles  I'm picking up dirt  When I fly by  Crossroads 
[02:55:30]  One million miles  I'm picking up dirt  When I fly by  It's a falling drizzle  Dropping on the street  Clean off the dirt  Beneath my feet  I got this speed on repeat  While I'm riding subway trains  Over tracks  Artifacts  To go clack  My heart is black 
[02:56:00]  But intact  I come fit  Take the music back  I'm moving forward  Sound you can't ignore it  I put the pedal to the floor  And stay pure  To the slime and the scum  The time has come  I lunge for it  I'm tight  Rope  Walking over  Fiery flames  Hot coals  I'm like  Water for you  Choles  I pay no tolls 
[02:56:30]  I speak to ghosts  And find the most high  In cracks  That you walk by  I got my eye in tune  To see your goons  I'm magic fly  You'll find a broom  The witch's stew  Which way to choose  I'm at the crossroads  But I'll never give my soul  It's already on  Crossroads  One million miles 
[02:57:00]  I'm picking up dirt  When I fly by  When I fly by  Crossroads  One million miles  I'm picking up dirt  When I fly  I'm a slave to the dawn  The chariot of flames  Is my home  Is my home  I'm in a glass of my own 
[02:57:30]  Lights out  You're all alone  With your heart as stone  Oh, oh, oh, yeah  And I'll crossroads  One million miles  Picking up dirt  When I fly by  Crossroads  One million miles  One million miles  I'm picking up dirt

[02:58:30]  As you're saying  You can get this on iTunes, right?  Yeah, you can get it there  I started writing notes myself  I'm like, get me a copy of this  And is the name of the song Crossroads?  Yeah, that song is called Crossroads  Yeah, just to make sure  Okay  Wow, that was good  Wow  I don't even know what to say  Yeah, you have a really interesting voice  Axl Rose has a  There's a certain name  For certain kind of voices  It almost sounds like they're hitting  Two notes at once  And I wish I knew more about voices  Because I would have a better thing to say  Than just this  Short-stopping  Nonsense  He's cracking up 
[02:59:00]  Basically, my mouth just opened  And I ruined everybody's morning  You just ruined that performance  Exactly  It was a beautiful song  I had to mention Axl Rose  And tie it into nothing  It's the beauty of us, though  You've got to respect that a little bit  I do  Take a great moment  And we wreck it for no reason  Are you going to do another song?  Yeah, we'll do another  Yeah, before we completely lose the momentum in the room  Yeah  We'll get one more from Modest Yahoo here  And that was Crossroads 
[02:59:30]  Which one are you going to do next?  This one's called Live Like a Warrior  Oh, good  That's what you did  I like that one a lot  Feel like the world don't love you  Feel like the world don't love you 
[03:00:00]  Only want to push you away  Some days people don't see you  You feel like you're in the way  Today you feel as everyone hates  Pointing their fingers  Looking at your mistakes  You do good  But they want great  No matter what you give  They still want to take  They give your love and they throw it back 
[03:00:30]  You give your heart and they go on attack  When there's nothing left for you  Only thing that you can do  Take  So today, today, live like you wanna  Let yesterday burn  Throw it in a fire  In a fire  In a fire  Live like a warrior  Today, today, live like you wanna  Let yesterday burn  And throw it in a fire 
[03:01:00]  In a fire  In a fire  Live like a warrior  Some things you should let go  It's only gonna pull you down  Just like wave on your shoulder  It's only gonna make you drown  We all swing high  We all swing low  All got secrets people don't know  We all got dreams that we can't let go 
[03:01:30]  We wanna be brave  Don't be afraid  No  Today, today, live like you wanna  Let yesterday burn  Throw it in a fire  In a fire  In a fire  Live like a warrior  Today, today, live like you wanna  Let yesterday burn  Throw it in a fire  In a fire  In a fire  Throw it in a fire

[03:02:30]  The Acoustic Evening is the name of your tour.  What is the name of this series?  It's just like Modest Yahoo Acoustic EP. 
[03:03:00]  Okay, and you can grab it on iTunes.  iTunes is the website.  And it is the...  I think we sold a few copies today.  I really do.  I think we sold a few.  Modestyahoworld.com slash tour.  But Modestyahoworld.com is the website.  Yep.  And you can probably get all tour information.  I'm so irritated.  Why?  I missed the dates in Huntington or Englewood or Asbury Park.  Because I didn't know.  Yeah, I just didn't know either.  We're busy doing this.  And we could have been doing that.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  I was just wondering to myself,  what can I possibly do to wreck the mood once again?  Mention shows you missed.  That's fascinating to the listening audience.  We're just showing how good they are, though.  By our own ignorance.  I know, but I just...  Two beautiful songs.  I'm motivating people to turn the radios off.  What a fool I am.  But there's dates coming up in Tampa, West Palm Beach, 
[03:04:00]  Wilmington, Delaware, Annapolis, Maryland,  which I think is sold out.  Well, you got Woodstock tomorrow night.  Oh, that's right.  Woodstock, New York.  Yes, and then Hartford on...  That would be the day...  Sunday.  Sunday, I guess, right?  Yes, okay.  You know what?  I stand corrected.  Morristown, New Jersey.  I didn't see that.  The 18th.  So that is...  Monday.  On Monday night.  I actually can go to that one.  Maybe we could go to that on Monday night.  Yes.  On the way back from AC.  He's got a big gig in AC.  That's what's screwing us all up here. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But yeah, I want to go see you.  I'm just deciding if I should go through my calendar.  And tell people.  Because I usually stop for gas on the way home.  And you know how that gets.  But I really want to go see you.  You can stop in Morristown on the way home to get your gas and see Monashahoo on Monday.  Well, the...  I really...  I want to plug the tour.  People will be...  What's going on?  Dude, I flew home from L.A. last night.  I'm exact.  I took two Dramamine when I flew.  Right.  And I'm fading very quickly. 
[03:05:00]  All of a sudden, it's hitting you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I still have to do another hour after this.  I'm tired.  But the audience will be able to ask you a question.  This is like an intimate show.  Oh, nice.  We do the songs.  And then we do like a little Q&A.  We chit-chat or whatever.  You do any covers?  We do.  Yeah.  We do Fast Car.  Really?  We do like a version of Fast Car mixed with No Woman No Cry.  Wow.  It's like the line of Fast Car with the words of No Woman No Cry.  Tracy Chapman.  Yeah.  Oh, very nice.  Yeah.  Fast Car. 
[03:05:30]  That's a great...  I haven't heard that song in a while.  It's a good song.  You guys probably make it your own, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Got a little twist to it.  Flip it.  Can you do it here?  Or is that asking too much?  Yeah, I guess we could.  Really?  Yeah, let's do it.  How great is it to be able to sing?  Holy crap.  You like a song, you just sing it?  They promised us two songs.  Honestly, if you don't want to, I understand.  You've already given us a great performance, but...  No problem.  It's our job to push it a little bit sometimes, I guess.  Yes.  Push.  All right, one more from Modest Yahoo before we start our weekend.  And then I have an interesting fact to add.  I don't know, but I'll sing it. 
[03:06:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:30]  I need a ticket to anywhere.  Maybe we can make a deal.  Maybe together we can get somewhere.  I'd always hope for better. 
[03:08:00]  Maybe together you and me fine.  If you get your fast car, then keep on going.  Take your fast car and keep on driving.  And a little modesty, I hope.  Me see the beer run, run, runnin' but you could not say.  And of them crazy murderers would never run from inside. 
[03:08:30]  Them try to keep me down because them see no joy.  All them know is them found.  So you call up a man, a boy.  I ain't not, I can't you see now.  Open up your eyes.  And every ball, them is a human in this guy.  Them said that my peaceful ways is long.  And I won't come my way.  Them said I'd be time to work and add her in a time to pay.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
