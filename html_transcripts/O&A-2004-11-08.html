<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with repeated "We'll be right back" announcements followed by an obscenity-laden outburst.  The show proper began with Opie and Anthony discussing their frustrating office renovations, noting a police officer's lack of progress observation over three weeks and the discovery of hidden cameras in the studio, leading to a conversation about installing their own online camera feed.  Jimmy's absence the previous Friday was mentioned, along with a discussion of comedian Pablo Francisco's difficult and annoying appearance on the show.  This segued into a lengthy, explicit discussion of Jimmy's encounter with a couple who had been on the show previously and were involved in webcam sex shows, featuring extended humorous commentary about awkward social situations and missed sexual opportunities.  A caller, Ty from Sacramento, recounted a story from Jimmy's stand-up show regarding audience reactions to his jokes based on age.  A listener-submitted song about "Monster Rain" was then played.  The show then featured a discussion of Tara Reid's wardrobe malfunction at a party, including a description and photo of her exposed breast and nipple post-surgery.

Further listener calls covered favorite sports teams, the upcoming Eminem album (which they received early), and the video game Halo 2.  An extended discussion about EverQuest and the excessive time spent playing it, including lost financial opportunities, ensued. A caller shared an uncomfortable story involving a young relative and Keith (one of the hosts).  More listener calls and a song about Dungeons & Dragons concluded this segment.  A rambling discussion about the origins of New York accents followed, humorously speculating about its linguistic evolution.  This transitioned to a commercial break for a Richard Pryor tribute and a family plan subscription.

Jim Norton then recounted a disastrous encounter with a 49-year-old (later estimated to be 54) massage therapist in Sacramento, describing her appearance, smell, and the discovery of a tampon during the massage in graphic detail.  The hosts and Norton engaged in vulgar and humorous commentary on the experience.  The conversation shifted to the "sexiest couple in America" contest and the eligibility of a Sacramento webcam couple. Listener calls followed, including one detailing promotional methods at truck stops and another expressing disgust at Norton's massage therapist story.  Further discussion focused on a 57-year-old woman expecting twins, prompting vulgar commentary on her age and the decision to have children.  This led to a discussion of Norton's experiences with older women.  A prank call to a listener's mother, pretending the listener worked in the adult film industry, was followed by more listener calls, including a heated exchange with a critical caller.  A discussion about a Falun Gong protest in New York City, featuring audio recordings of an interview with largely inarticulate protesters, concluded the segment with further humorous commentary.

The next segment started with mocking commentary on the previous segment's protesters.  Jim Norton recounted a *Bad Boys* filming experience, contrasting his on-screen portrayal with his personal perceptions of police interactions within the Black community. A listener call detailed a "midget sighting," followed by a discussion of a suicide at Ground Zero protesting President Bush's re-election, eliciting cynical comments and dark humor.  Discussion ensued on Ground Zero construction, tourist behavior, and a negative anecdote about Susan Sarandon's visit.  A sexually charged and vulgar phone call with a job applicant, Tally, resulted in a job offer.  The show concluded with discussions about a man murdering his nagging wife, including personal anecdotes from Opie and Anthony and listener calls on marital conflict and divorce.  This was followed by audio of Tony Danza outtakes.

The following segment began with Opie joking about wanting to run over his wife.  A caller, Mike, recounted an argument with Opie and Anthony about getting a cell phone.  Another caller, Mike, described walking in on his ex-wife having sex with his best friend, who now lived with them and their children.  John the trucker called, claiming to have killed his first wife after nagging while on acid, detailing the event, his 15-year prison sentence, and meeting his current wife after his name appeared in *Easy Rider* magazine, stating it was "worth it" to avoid child support.  A sexually explicit and racially charged conversation comparing experiences with white and Black women followed.  A segment criticized the show's misogynistic promotional pieces, with staff member Steve expressing concern.  The hosts debated the veracity of John the trucker's story, concluding it was likely fabricated.  Further listener calls, including a midget sighting and an anal sex question answered by Jim Norton, along with a Tony Danza outtake reel and a Blondie/Doors mashup, concluded this segment.

The final segment featured numerous listener calls, including one from Ohio expressing dislike for Canadians and using homophobic slurs.  Discussion covered Americans' post-election reactions about moving to Canada, and speculation on Michael Moore's happiness. Crude jokes about Keith the Cop and one host's mother were made.  The hosts discussed a party attended by Anthony's family, described as resembling a scene from *The Sopranos*. A caller claiming to be a barber with extreme hairstyling methods had a comical conversation about getting a job at a Wall Street barbershop.  The segment concluded with a commercial for America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XM Radio.

[00:30:00]  not unless there's a third arsonist in the grassy knoll i might be going down on this one  and my punishment was i had to do tv commercials which is up there should be one set of laws for  everybody right you got arrested for arson you shouldn't have been able to get away with it with  a tv commercial by the way i'm glad that's how it works i didn't know what the it was i'm like hi i'm bob 
[00:30:30]  at goldway if you're ever on a talk show don't set it on fire back to you mcgruff  and here's your old friend kelsey grammar with some safe driving tips  i'm still trying to figure out what the  rossie o'donnell and penny marshall did to a kmart they had to work off 
[00:31:00]  but they better hurry i was at an airport this is a true story you're going wow there's an untapped  comedy bonanza we never heard a comic talk about airports but i was at an airport and this woman  came up to me and said i don't want to insult you but you look like bobcat goldway  i have a goddamn thing to say back i was like 
[00:31:30]  i was at a casino i was minding my own business this guy came up he said you're gonna have to move  you're blocking the fire exit so if there was a fire i wasn't gonna run  if you're flammable and have legs you are never blocking a fire exit  if you can write that down and put a dash in front of it and put my name at the bottom  a dash dash that's all i wanted to be doing is dash i type 101 words a minute but it's in my own 
[00:32:00]  language i had the aids test four times the aids test is very scary to get doesn't matter what you've  been doing waiting for the results it's frightening so i don't get the regular aids test anymore  i get the round and about aids test i found my friend brian i said say brian do you know anybody  who has aids no cool because you know me 
[00:32:30]  i was on i was on a bus and it was the middle of the night and i had a box of crackers  and a can of easy cheese but it was the middle of the night so i could not see  i could not see how much easy cheese i was applying to each cracker so each bite into  the cracker was a surprise as to how much easy cheese i had applied which makes me believe they  should have a glow in the dark version of easy cheese it's not like the product has any integrity  to begin with if you buy a room temperature cheese that you squeeze out of a can you probably won't 
[00:33:00]  get mad because it glows in the dark too say fuck on this channel oh jesus that's shocking  holy fuck i need coffee this is the best show ever  and we're back with the op and anthony show speaking of eminem uh we all have our copies of

[00:40:00]  i know you guys are into gta and all but i know halo 2 is coming out today so i was wondering if you  guys knew anything about that if you're excited it was coming out and there's a possibility we'd be  able to play you guys online or something well the problem is i never played uh halo because i don't  have the xbox and i'm but i'm thinking that they're they're talking about this game like it's going  to be even better than gta san andreas that i think i'm going to have to pick up an xbox different type  of game it's a totally different type of game but it's going to be really really good and the online  play is much better for xbox than it is for playstation don't you know what's coming out in a week or so 
[00:40:30]  it's coming out tomorrow no don't you know don't you know what's coming out in a week or so  half-life 2 my friend oh gonna blow halo 2 away that's for the pc though right yeah you know the  the game platform real people play on yeah real gamers play on i can't afford that kind of uh  hardware oh what are you spending your money on you got to spend it on computer equipment to play games  with i'll send it on my food and rent and all that i don't need that stuff you need to play and you 
[00:41:00]  get you could play online now uh through uh xbox yeah but i don't know can you hook it up to a cable  yeah it's cable modem or dsl 16 players i thought you'd be there with your dial-up connection getting  your ass kicked no you can only do that on playstation they don't allow that on xbox you  take like two shots at somebody and then the the lag catches up and you realize you were killed 15 
[00:41:30]  minutes ago wonderful see you're definitely you know about it so i'm online all the time there's a lot  of people out there that are interested you know and if you guys get the opportunity we'd love to  play with you guys yeah i hear it's pretty good i hear it's going to be a pretty good game i'll  check it out yeah it's going to be awesome i definitely suggest picking it up well all right  guys all right brian thank you so much all right we gotta move we gotta move on but uh yeah they're  talking about halo like it's going to be just uh just unbelievable a lot of great games to choose  from this a lot of good ones coming out everquest 2 uh comes out i think today or tomorrow 
[00:42:00]  and um what a fag game that is but i'll be right there i pre-ordered it i'm ready to rock  it's like a new beginning to be dragged back into the everquest addiction not only that stupid  you know they're they really do rope us in because it's a pay service you have to pay money to play  this game every month it's a monthly fee what is uh everquest ixnay on the monthly fee a yeah i i don't  know that's what's going on with this radio program that works keith the cop who is my brother in 
[00:42:30]  arms on everquest how much is it a month i think we're paying 12 a month now 12 bucks a month for  one character on everquest i was up to three characters playing at once i had two computers  and a laptop so you know do some math you figure out what i was spending a month to play well why  i don't understand the game why three characters like i don't understand jimmy i was my own group  what you want to do is group up with other players and you could take down bigger uh bigger  villains and stuff on the game if you have a lot of players with you and you get group experience 
[00:43:00]  and uh some things you can't do perhaps perhaps my character can't heal but i can do a lot of battle  damage then you need another character who is uh better at healing so i would put together my own  group of three people and i'm working at like you know emerson lake and palmer keyboard player you know  i got different levels of of keyboards for computers going around and i would be my own group and i  would rumor about uh taking down various uh uh bad things don't look at me like that it's like  calling yourself on the phone going hello what is this you want to play yeah i'm not with anthony 
[00:43:30]  on this one at all you know why because you never played it it's one of those addictive games that you  get on uh if you describe the game it sounds like the gayest thing ever dude i watched you guys play  it in the office many many hours and i was not about watching either you gotta be involved it looked a  little slow a little boring little you know a very time-consuming very time-consuming indeed i  mean there's a feature on the game it tells you how many hours you've been playing right how many 
[00:44:00]  hours how many days all right in real time and it adds up all the hours that you've played and puts  them together into how many days you've actually played the game not how many days you since you  logged on but how many actual days you've played sat there wasting playing the game keith what are you up  to i started in january of 2002 and i have 141 days so he spent 141 days of his life in front of the  computer playing this game that's like two 12-hour periods would equal one day they actually added up 
[00:44:30]  hours to real day it's right real days real days yeah yeah and we worked we worked it out one day we  were playing and uh i was sitting there and i figured out how much the nypd would have paid me  if i went to work for those days right and i had like 120 days at time and i would have made like  110 thousand dollars or something in overtime in overtime and then anthony wasn't working yet so he  figured out that uh the old company paid him about 563 thousand dollars yeah it would have been a huge 
[00:45:00]  amount for me playing everquest but i used to play at work so really yeah thanks for growing up our  spot keith jesus well the company was in all the papers wasn't it you know what the company would  have paid me to play everquest nothing because the contract didn't get done fast enough i'm sorry  i was busy i was away arranging things neatly and putting  you're still bitter about that are you so um yeah he doesn't even want to look 
[00:45:30]  yeah all right i had a question about everquest i can't remember yes damn it everquest  trust me no one cares oh you know how many people are playing i understand but no one cares they want  to hear about tara reed's boob well of course here pass it out you see tara reed's boob i did pass out  our worksheets do we have this up on opanthony.com yet we probably will let me see that awful yeah  tara reed was at uh puff daddy's 35th birthday party they did the whole red carpet thing and uh 
[00:46:00]  she's wearing this uh very slinky um dress you know over the shoulder number there yeah very loose  fitting you know two straps and uh she just had a um um uh breast implants put in and she walks on  the red carpet and one of the shoulder straps just falls off and now she's exposed to the  the paparazzi and she's claiming that she had no idea that her boob was sticking out but she looks  completely drunk in the face she looks completely hammered but how do you not notice that this huge  boob is sticking out you you would notice just by the reaction of uh the photographers and everything 
[00:46:30]  you know maybe she just thought they were looking at her new boobs through the dress  well no she i mean she should get her money back because this uh this shot is awful she's got like  a franken uh nipple going on there it's very scarred up on her nipple it looks like they removed  the nipple and shoved the implant in there and then or or stapled it back on cut half of it to  lift it up so they can get something in there i don't know what they did but they completely wrecked  her nipple she had that done on the way to the party in the limo that's hilarious so you know the 
[00:47:00]  the point i was going to make is she knew exactly what she was doing you think yeah this is the new  thing with celebrities you know they they feel like uh you know they're not getting the attention they  deserve or whatever and this is the type of thing that gets people talking about you again and it  made page six it made page six it's it's everywhere yeah they're even showing this on tv obviously you  know pixelated or whatever but it's it's everywhere now everyone's talking about tara reed today she  knew exactly what she was doing talking about her boob slippage disaster they call it this is the 
[00:47:30]  latest uh trend with the celebrities that's why you're you're seeing the paris hilton tapes or whatever  you know and her saying the n-word and smoking pot and doing threesomes the controversy gets you in  the news yeah the sex tapes the the celebrities you know they're they're the ones sneaking those  things out to people so we should and when we go on a news program we should do it with our our hogs  out like on mackenroe we should have we should have came out with our hogs hanging out and gone oh  sorry i i didn't even know not a bad idea this is a disaster well i can't believe my junk was hanging 
[00:48:00]  out we should uh we should get together and try to figure out something we could do and make believe we  we had no idea what's going on put on a dress and have your boob come out but uh besides the  nipple thing from a from afar it looks like it's it's a nice uh set of implants yeah but tara reed  kind of looks okay with her clothes on i've seen nude shots of her she kind of got a funny body it's  kind of funny looking yeah funny looking you know she's got this uh no hips thing going on it goes 
[00:48:30]  straight down but she's you know she's all right all right let's say i go to the phones there yes  and talk to matt and telling her there's a lady telling her there's a photo of the woman walking  over yeah yeah her publicist the last shot is a publicist there's someone walking over again  excuse me your tit is hanging out well the publicist is walking over and she's got to look like she's  panicked on her face like oh my god i can't believe this happened but in her mind she's like this 
[00:49:00]  is so good for my clients not even funny this is what's gonna make the news uh because it's not like  it was hillary clinton's boob or something yeah well which would be obviously uh but also would  wreck her career obviously right but uh something like this happening with tara reed it could only  help yep because now playboy's gonna want to get involved i don't know if they will not because  it's already been seen yeah but then they'll they'll spin in in some way you know how long  go we let tara heal for three months and this is how it looks yeah how old are the implants maybe  they're just new and that's my god it looks like like jim said it looks like they did it on the 
[00:49:30]  way over to the party perhaps she should be wearing a brassiere to hold those things up while  they heal a little better you're supposed to see that implant fall right out a nipple open like  a door on a cuckoo clock and the implant comes spilling out all over p diddy's appetizers  i don't want that implant spilling out all over the dock that kentner implant  that's awful it is awful love it let's say hi to matt hey matt what's up yeah what's up

[00:53:30]  this year steelers 27-3 over the eagles steelers look way too tough i'll be at the game next week  and monday night in dallas couldn't wait for a pittsburgh caller no i want to go with well i look i'm i'm  going right through the list nice all right uh what do you have mark you guys still need someone  to take that bus trip to california well i i haven't told the guys this yet but uh one of my brothers  wants to go on it wow really and uh where's steve because we've already researched the trip oh oh ben's 
[00:54:00]  got it all right ben's got it why why is he breathing like darth vader speaking did you get my email about  the darth vader mask yes i did all right we got to get that for the next time we do lesbian for a day  mm-hmm so that way uh pablo can put it on sound exactly like he does uh yeah my brother might go  on the trip all right cool all right but you could email ben and maybe my brother needs someone to go  with insane well all right thanks guys he's in between jobs right now and he's he's uh willing 
[00:54:30]  to take one for the team that is a long trip we're talking about uh uh uh greyhound trips yeah i took a  greyhound trip cross country and it just sucks when i was a kid oh it's the worst prostitutes and  and wino bums it's awful and then the toilet's right there in the bus it's not like you you get  off so so when when some animal takes a dump in there it stinks the entire bus up for miles you  just drive with the smell of someone's crap in your nose yeah so we were talking about and then other 
[00:55:00]  people uh had their stories about their greyhound trips and we're thinking of sending someone from  new york to la and then have them just check in for like three days because it turns out it's a  three-day trip well where's the where's the list look at some of the garden spots it hits yeah give  that to anthony basically it would be a three-day trip and it just it just drives for three straight  days you don't stop and sleep in a in a motel or anything they just keep going you're able to do  is uh you're able to get off the bus at any point at these stops and um sightsee or grab a hotel 
[00:55:30]  and go to sleep and then you can just hop on the next bus that's coming through that town and  continue your trip okay so we could take you a year to complete the trip but no one has them if  you're taking a bus you don't have the money or time to to be stopping and doing things so uh  you leave new york and uh your next stop is beautiful newark new jersey right out of the gate  but there's uh plenty other places steve is telling me 62 stops this bus stops in 62 towns between here and 
[00:56:00]  la uh-huh and my brother's willing to do this but there's got to be a point to the trip we got to  kind of develop this bit a little better instead of him just jumping on a bus and he gets to la  you'll be getting into tuscaloosa alabama at eight in the morning hey how about that  you want rust in louisiana hmm how about grambling louisiana how about there's like 10 stops in louisiana  canton texas a lot of stops in texas too wonderful abilene sweetwater texas up sweetwater texas 
[00:56:30]  look at that it's a whole page of texas wait why are you going through texas if you're going  new york to la dude oh this doesn't go direct no dude this might miss something this thing goes all  the way down this thing goes down to washington yeah you go from new york you would think you're  just angled perfectly from new york to la route 80 yeah but this one it goes down first then let's get  the states new york jersey maryland dc virginia north carolina georgia alabama mississippi 
[00:57:00]  louisiana texas whole page of texas new mexico arizona and uh into california oh from verbodynia  california what to uh la oh it just is an awful trip in an awful rolling tin can with stinky 
[00:57:30]  people that cannot afford uh even an amtrak trip well my brother's willing to do it he's crazy really  wants to do it yeah and he'll check in every morning he'll make sure he's up when we're doing  the radio show and give us updates that one doesn't even take the route that i took which took me through  vegas which was kind of interesting yeah that'd be cool kid that one's just that one's the the  nowhere express all right so uh we're we're thinking about it if we could if we could like uh develop 
[00:58:00]  this where it makes sense i think we're going to send my brother out like next monday you know what  we should do we look at all these crappy little places it stops and see if there's the attraction  like the biggest ball of twine oh that's not a good idea see what attraction there is see what the  biggest thing all of these towns have to offer in it what the biggest attraction is hey what's that  tarareed more naked tarareed uh tim in los angeles how about those rams oh fuck the rams how about  those rams pat's 40 rams 22 you're welcome in 1988 oh yeah oh they're in st louis now la

[01:05:00]  send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice  uh you know what's worried about new york and i i was like this is my little story of my life  i was born in new york and i grew up in florida hollywood florida which is a very beautiful place  but it's very different and i used to talk like this when i was a little kid because i've been  from brooklyn you know i would talk like this like my mola made the best fucking spaghetti  and that's how we talk and i moved to florida and the kids used to make fun of my accent  they're like they hey kids say something hey what do you want me to say 
[01:05:30]  and they go so you become aware of your accent so it's not really a stick but the weird thing  about the new york accent there's no logical way the new york accent could have been conceived no  logical way first people in america were who the united states were who danish all right well you  have a different textbook than than we did because it was an indian thing i don't know maybe you're  missing chapter one or you're absent that day or how easy we ever get the indians but i know what you  meant and you're right in a sense if you just like wipe wipe off the indians like we did many many years 
[01:06:00]  ago you know that's an easy way to figure that but you were the good thing is that you're ready  with the answer right away you know you didn't you had 10 or 20 seconds before the buzzer was going  to sound but you were danish you know what i mean and that's you know unless you were ordering from  the bar and i didn't you know you know what i mean it was like danish they're like oh shit the timing  was impeccable you know but uh uh yeah um but anyway so but the the first people in america were indians  and their accent is nothing like new york and the first people to settle in the in the united states  in new york where we're british people and their accent's nothing like new york the dutch well 
[01:06:30]  the dutch they they that didn't stay long they went all the way down to bowling green they couldn't  find parking because they off and went home that's what happened with the danish it's really true but  the british actually were the settlers and they um and uh but no matter what there's no logical way the  accent could have been conceived because even if it was indians and danish how did kemosabe and like  all right turn into opium's joke you know what i mean right there's no natural progression anywhere unless  christopher columbus spoke that way yeah i was like hey who's sailing the freaking nina jesus that 
[01:07:00]  boats going up and down all over the ocean over there guys a freak look at him going up and down  he's drunk like delaware you know heather richard pryor changed the way today's comics think  and xm comedy 150 along with rhino records is presenting a nine-week tribute to richard pryor  a shot one of them tries boom like most dogs you can stare down you don't look at them they go  you stare at the door and they go wednesday november 3rd at 9 p.m east we'll present the

[01:08:30]  boo pictures up already on opian anthony.com hey there we go maybe i should look at opian anthony.com  more often now it's twice to say if i was to pay for it it would have to be a young hot chick 
[01:09:00]  you know what are you talking oh with a little discussion we were having during commercial  norton saves his best stuff uh when we go to break and then i have to look at him like why aren't you  talking about this on the air he went to sacramento he's a successful uh touring comic when he's not  doing the opian anthony show he pretty much goes somewhere every weekend he was in sacramento and  he had three uh sold out shows the fourth uh show was pretty much sold out as well and all the fans 
[01:09:30]  were there and everyone saying he killed and then he went back to uh adam and ariel's house the the  the couple that is uh in the lead as sexiest state in america which there is a controversy on that but  we'll get to that in a second and he went back to uh to their apartment just to meet their  creepy friend ed yeah i mean you it's these people think you're a rock star when you're not on stage  bro they have they know i'm an ass and then what what did you get you got a massage last night before  i flew home now this is a prime example of somebody who does this so much who pays for women's company 
[01:10:00]  so much that it's nothing special anymore it's nothing you look forward to like like it would  somebody who never does it and would really go through the shopping process and make sure you're  paying for the best thing you could possibly get like i've never paid i i've never paid for it i  couldn't bring myself to do it it's something i just why are you looking at us i know weird  i'm i almost there i i in recent history have stopped girls from giving me hummers because i i had 
[01:10:30]  one i wanted to pay for later that night i'd rather pay for it isn't that odd why would you rather pay  for it i don't know it's just the way he is part of the uh the dirty factor i don't know man like  extra naughty probably i just like the idea of it like here's the cash you know there's just  something about that exchange that is saying something about yourself like groupie or something  let's say no no i'm not an idiot i mean i'm not gonna blow off a nine just to pick up a seven or a  six from for money i'll tell you what it is i i'll do a little psychoanalysis here jimmy is so 
[01:11:00]  self-hating that he feels he's not worthy to pay for it like he's not worthy he shouldn't be  getting it for free right like the girl has to get some type of compensation for doing stuff to him  you know it's because i hate my fat tits so whenever i'm paying for it i don't care that  they're dangling right i'd play out my nipples now he'd be self-conscious if the girl's doing this  for free he's a little more self-conscious about what's going on if he's paying it's like screw you 
[01:11:30]  bitch i'm paying you that's why you're here with me yeah exactly we all know this is honest it's  gonna be awful for you just play with my nipples we'll both dissociate and get through it so now  if i was paying for it it would be i i would shop around to find the best hottest chick for the money  i was paying sometimes it's not you know jim and i have discussed this sometimes it's not about uh the  hotness of a chick so what is it about sometimes the uh the slobs you know try a little harder give  you a little extra and that's kind of a turn on too well jimmy what did you what did you have 
[01:12:00]  well i was in sacramento i said you know i'm flying home in a couple hours why not get a massage relax  myself a little relax a little that's good on the air coughing but it's not about the massage well no  it's about the end of the massage right and this girl was a hundred bucks and i went to her online  girl stop saying girl all right this 49 year old uh 49 year old woman he's paying how did you know she  was 49 i well i looked at her online she looked good and there was a picture of her hiney up in  the air and the thong was barely covering you know so she looked like she really had like a nice little 
[01:12:30]  little hot dog pack down there which i like a nice big lips so i'm like all right this is the girl for  me she comes over she gets lost she comes in and has that old lady reek of cigarettes you know that  do you know the old lady cigarette smell yeah it's in their hair and she looked good in the picture  what was a brand new amc pacer behind her her fingernails were all yellow from all the smoke  and she does oh dude she had she had on like brown um what do you want honey 
[01:13:00]  she had slacks on they were like they were like mom slacks slacks brown mom slacks  and she had a bunt and her breasts were kind of like awful i'm 50 years old  i'm 50 years old don't i look good i'm 50 years old 100 bucks i'm like all right 100 bucks so i lay  down on my stomach and she starts giving me the massage and she strips down to the thong but it  didn't here's what like you ever see somebody with a bunt put a thong on they pull the thong up high 
[01:13:30]  you know so the thong comes all the way up to almost their belly button and it's covering their  bunt oh no that is horrible man she had a dark tattoo of a flower right by her uh her crotch but  it was like it was like it was like an old sailor tattoo it was like an old like when you're an old  guy his arm is all like black and blue it looks like ozzy's knuckle color like the ozzy on his  like that type of color it's lost any brightness to it whatsoever it was awful and i'm looking at it  i can kind of see the lips i'm like i'm getting turned on oh and she's like yeah not bad for a 
[01:14:00]  grandmother and i was like oh no way swear to god not bad for a grandmother how did you know she was  49 she told me no that means she's older than 49 who are you kidding you know you're probably right  you're probably right i mean you gotta add a minimum of five years onto this so she's probably 53 54  she probably was yeah 53 54 it was 100 especially if she says 49 that is really really heinous well  she um was massaging me and i don't know why she's like do you want to massage me and her ass 
[01:14:30]  looked like two lima beans it was long and flat but i kept i massaged it anyway and i was trying to like  peek between the legs and then uh why i don't know now i'm with anthony now at this point i'm out i had  to get out i had to get on a plane i had a full rod and i'm like i was trying to get her to you know  drink from the mule and uh she's like oh i don't know did you hug her after she got out of the bathtub  and then run after the out of the room that exactly i wrote about her and that's exactly who  i referenced she clawed danny's sweater 
[01:15:00]  danny oh that is exactly who she reminded me  i think we better take danny to a doctor when do you think maybe we should take danny to an escort  oh that's horrible awful lima bean ass oh it's brutal she was topless too you said  well she told me i i was playing my nipples i'm like i i just like like sometimes when the girls  rub me i'll lay on my back and like a praying mantis i just diddle my nipples and it's just 
[01:15:30]  completely disconnect from any human contact while she does what she does to my mule and um she's like  my nipples are sensitive too and she pops them out and they were like oh man they were brutal  yeah dragging on the ground all day they would be sensitive little pinocchio noses but i did toy  with them she's like i like both both she wanted me to toy with them with both hands because i think  she just didn't want me touching other body parts which i wouldn't have anyway yeah oh i almost forgot  the best part so i'm playing with the nipples but meanwhile i want to play with mine so i try to 
[01:16:00]  like you know pull her thong aside she's like well i don't know i have a tampon and so i pull it  aside oh my god i swear to god she did not she's been through menopause she pulled it aside  there was a string i just wanted to see the lips and there's a string it was awful  it was disgusting  she gave a pretty good hummer though she's a pretty good hummer of course she's had a lot  of practice many years yeah i forgot the tamp oh she uses the old 60s technique that she learned 
[01:16:30]  i'm sure the old hippie technique so did she uh whack you off yeah well she drank her arthritic  she drank it huh well she didn't drink it but i mean she you know she was uh it's good for my  osteoporosis hello you're singing all the right things there honey  how you doing tonight darling oh you thought you were gonna get action from arielle one half of  the sexiest uh couple in america yes and you end up with a grandma i thought at least i get

[01:18:00]  and the the ambulance came yeah it was amazing driving miss daisy yeah driving miss daisy i'm just  trying to drive you to jim norton that is really heinous an old broad is that the oldest broad you've been  with how old is the oldest gal you've been with in that probably in that area i don't mess with older  women i don't obviously you don't well i mean aside from uh very recently very rarely  very rarely she was 20 years older than you i don't have that fetish at all i don't have that  it's not only not a fetish it is something to repulse you i'll agree you cannot have a fetish to 
[01:18:30]  something but still you know if it comes your way take it yeah that is somewhere i dare not venture  i assume you know god willing and the river don't rise uh there'll be plenty of time to bang old broads  yeah you know she was awful you do it now it's i i don't see any for it i don't see anything sexy  about that i don't either that is a horrific story out of the shining i just started hugging 
[01:19:00]  her and she looked really good and then i just pulled back when she started laughing and i looked  at her back oh hot all right speaking of sexiest state america speaking of sexiest state sexiest state  state state state shut up um a lot of people are are thinking that we should disqualify the sacramento  couple why is that now why professionals how professional are they people are taking this 
[01:19:30]  contest very seriously we have a couple that might call in today matter of fact but uh are they truly  professional or do they do this well we got to make a ruling here i mean they they the couple  from sacramento they do webcam shows and people think they should be disqualified that it should  just be regular you know normal everyday ona listener is just banging out there i'll tell you why i  disagree you don't have a qualification for the wiffle ball bat challenge porno girl regular girl  anybody can do it and this isn't like it's on video if this was video i'd say maybe yeah but it's on 
[01:20:00]  the phone it's like man anybody can do it on the phone i i have to agree i think uh whoever wants  to do it as long as it's over the phone and happening live i don't care if it's a porn star  all right then there it is there's because the final judgment is made by the listeners opie right  and if a porn star gets up there and starts doing that porn star moaning and stuff that's phony  they're not going to win anyway right i think they did a pretty good job  i don't know what's up eric hey how are you go away what's the matter i won't accept your calls 
[01:20:30]  anymore eric can you guys be more funnier go away can you be more funnier go away you're gonna get  yelled at by howie you keep calling us all his people calls us they're ready to jump ship uh nick in  detroit what's going on hey you guys uh i just wanted to call and tell you guys how i'm spreading  the virus uh what i got going on is when i stop at the truck stops like the big tas and pilots and 
[01:21:00]  whatnot they all have sample displays for the xm so i take my unit in with me i slap my unit  skyfi into their display model let your show play until something you know great and offensive  happens and everyone starts coming up and asking about it huh how about that i think it's working  out better than those uh listener sticker stops at least well we're trying to uh you know market  the show ourselves because uh quite frankly they've decided not to market the radio show that's pretty 
[01:21:30]  obvious at this point so uh so our listeners are doing wow sticker stops and doing whatever they can  to uh you know spread the show out there for us can i ask a question i'm sorry yeah was that a wacky  call you got from eric was that like one of the wacky calls that no he uh he loves us and he calls  us pretty much every day he's emailing us he wants to be part of our show all right  he's not the only one so many of the people that uh that do howard's show want to do our show 
[01:22:00]  yeah but we stink that much i guess hey jim you got any gigs coming up what's that you got any  gigs coming up jim uh nothing on the road for a little while except for saturday at the hammer  steam with my friends opie and anthony uh although it's almost sold i know exactly what he did but i'm  plug it's trying but that was yeah you got any gigs coming up and then when i went what he answered  me stupid you should have hung up on me when i said what not wait for me to get started that  that isn't even really the gag no and that's mean spirited and it hurts it's hurtful it's hurtful  by the way anthony the lions uh lost to the redskins last night uh 17 to 10 they did there you go 
[01:22:30]  well that call was from uh detroit so oh uh rick in boston what's up rick uh yeah what's up guys hey  um i just wanted to tell norton um i'm driving down the street heading to friggin school and you're  making me want to puke dude oh the old lady what the old lady no thought you're talking about escrow  services and i actually uh one of my friends was telling me about the place he goes to down in  providence and i was thinking about going there but now i mean dude that's just you got to shop around 
[01:23:00]  jimmy doesn't really shop around he just takes whatever is going to be the quickest girl to get there and  and give him a full release yeah because it's not about uh not spending the money norton will  spend a lot of money for the right he spends more on the right girls and dude you can't let my my  misfortune if so if your friend buys a lemon it doesn't stop you from going car shopping no he's  talking about all the asian chicks that he gets yeah why for what i've never had one that was sexy 
[01:23:30]  really two asians they were both awful and the one you just talked about was sexy no she was an  atrocity but i've had quite a few sexy white chicks or black chicks or spanish never a sexy  asian they're all business the asian oh they're off they're like they're like aliens you know the  expressionless face that like the et aliens had not easy but in close encounters like close  encounters when they got off the ship wide stupid eyes just nothing no no emotion behind it okay you  lay back now just awful you want some sexy faces and a little wink and i want some human contact some 
[01:24:00]  type of a face that isn't actually sculptured out of porcelain that's just looking at me she could  be doing your nails or delivering some sushi to you it's the same expression it really is all the  same to them doesn't matter just pay off that slavery ship debt so you're telling me that you  would rather get an atrocity than get an asian no no no i don't dislike it no please dude but i've just  never had i'm saying my experience i haven't had any hot asian girls yet you have mama son  jimmy gets the old asian woman yeah it was rosie from mesh smells like a kimchi pot 
[01:24:30]  all right i'm hanging up on a few people here there you go sorry about that all right speaking  of old broads there's a 57 year old lady in the paper that's going to have twins anthony  how about how do they make this one work i mean uh is it a natural child thing happening here or  it's probably the drugs they give them all kinds of drugs because these selfish whores want to be  mothers yep this selfish whore i always knew i wanted uh i wanted children at 57 years old 
[01:25:00]  career gal is now ready to start a family career gal that's it right there by the way face it you  have reached the second plateau it's over you know yet now it's just selfish alita saint james is  expecting the best gift of her life for her 57th birthday this week newborn twins saint james a  motivational speaker and the eldest sister of guardian angel leader curtis leewa did you read that i know  that she's the sister yeah it's set to shatter conventional limitations of childbirth tomorrow 
[01:25:30]  when she is slated to deliver a baby boy and girl at mount sinai hospital just three days shy of her  birthday oh that kid's been in a womb that's probably like leather all dried up like a saddle like saddle  leather oh she conceived through in vitro fertilization and she will become the oldest american woman to give  birth birth to twins one of the oh you want your career have your career you want a career have a  career want to be a mom be a mom make a decision do you know how awful it's going to be for that kid

[01:28:00]  and this woman is going to be the laughing stock she's gonna make her kid the laughing stock you  know how embarrassing it is i knew kids that had like really old parents it's it's embarrassing for  the kid she can't do anything go to a parent uh a parent student like outing one of those things  and she's gonna be sitting there nodding off with oxygen and a walker bedpan under her 
[01:28:30]  she'll be 75 when her kids uh graduate high school it's selfish look at tony randall that  old bastard had those kids and then drops dead and all those people were applauding like oh good for  you great tony good for you you know he wants to be a dad to a little kid and those kids are now  what five six years old and they don't understand why daddy's dead already we'll never know the the  father what a what a selfish selfish thing to do all right adopt a kid at least yeah adopt some  mongoloid yeah take in a little black boy or something and touch its smooth skin well she says 
[01:29:00]  something about the adoption thing here oh she does the reason that i want to carry these children  rather than adopting them is that i knew that i could uh give them while they were in the uterus a  tremendous amount of love a tremendous amount of support i wanted to give them that start oh  i don't think of myself with a number i don't think oh i'm going to be 60 i think i'm going to take  these kids to school she added yeah sure you probably got to sew the thing up like uh one of those turkeys 
[01:29:30]  after you put the stuffing just to hold the kid in for term i'm ready to fall out with her uterus i'm  ready she said with great determination resting her swollen frame against the living room wall  oh man you kind of like that though don't you because you like pregnant and you like him older  too now let's hope he digs the older oh he does he's a weirdo he's a weirdo i like the i have a  older woman fetish but that was when i was younger now that now that's a problem i got to get rid of 
[01:30:00]  that fetish because well you know we're getting up there now so now for that fetish to happen i got to  be into like i don't know 50 year olds never liked older women i'm talking when i was like 18 19 20 and i saw  the mothers in their like early 30s that was a major turn on even as high as 40 yeah  so i gotta get rid of that fetish obviously yeah let's see now looks like the indiana jones ride at  disney kid'll come toppling out of their big boulder chasing them hey bill what's up  bill you still there hey yeah all right let's go hello bill uh i teach uh kindergarten in a philly suburb

[01:31:00]  well you know it's definitely all the heavy lifting it's definitely the new thing people  are having kids a lot later in life it's the drugs they're able to do that in vitro they're  able to give them drugs and uh they could have these kids out of their selfish for for these selfish  reasons well that's the problem that's why this 57 year old bag is having twins i've seen old old  bags with triplets and man they don't have the energy to take care of those of course they don't  they don't have the energy to take care of them or to do what's necessary to like raise a healthy  kid oh you want to be able to interact with your child not not be a mess sitting there in a chair 
[01:31:30]  because you can't go out there ah what a what a selfish what a selfish thing to do well a lot of  these a lot of these women have this thing where it's so hip and they think that any woman that wants  to be a mother is like a cornball or submissive to men like i want my career i'm not going to be a  slave like that and then they realize that they're unfulfilled whores by the time they're 60 and like  gee maybe being a mom wasn't such a degrading awful thing let me try doing that now let me take a  whack at it now it's 60 yeah that's it because their career left them unfulfilled yeah well your

[01:40:00]  it oh kill yourself  oops  uh-oh  Oh, Korn's doing a cover. 
[01:40:30]  Uh-oh.  I have this thing about bands.  You know, when they start doing covers, you know, they know their careers are starting to wane.  You don't like that one?  That one's a good one.  It's definitely good, but a lot of bands, you know, they take that route when...  When the well is dry.  When the well is dry.  And it helps their career a little longer, and then all of a sudden they just kind of, you know, fall off the side of the mountain there.  I've got to say, though, they do a cover of Another Brick in the Wall in this greatest hits album that I think just blows. 
[01:41:00]  Well, there you have it.  It's just, it's like two...  They try and do...  You know how Another Brick in the Wall, there's all those parts?  They try and do parts one, two, and three.  You don't hear U2 doing covers yet.  No, they do live.  No, it's Sabbath, really.  Shut up.  We're not getting into that today.  They've done many covers, actually, though.  But not really on an album.  No, on B-sides and stuff like that.  I mean, Rattle and Home, they did some...  And they did Everlasting Love, but they do a lot of covers live.  And then on that last tour, they went into Bob Marley during Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Right, but they're not putting it out on a brand-new disc. 
[01:41:30]  That's what I'm saying.  When they do the specialty disc, like a Rattle and Home or something like that, sure, a B-side disc, fine.  But you don't really see them doing a cover because they don't really have to.  When bands do covers, they have to, to try to keep their careers going, in general.  You know who did a great cover, by the way, of Blue Suede Shoes?  It was Sabbath in 1969.  I'm telling you, they did a great Blue Suede Shoes cover.  That's great.  Who cares?  By the way, there was a...  I'm pointing out that it's not always at the end of the career.  Sometimes it's the beginning of the career.  Yeah, Sabbath is so relevant today, Jim.  We were talking about a 57-year-old mom having twins, by the way.  There's always every man that's...  Shut up. 
[01:42:00]  I don't care about Sabbath today.  I know, but Ben said something I didn't care for.  I love these two when they go back and forth with the Ozzy Sabbath crap.  Yeah, Ozzy called the show on Friday.  He's getting a divorce.  Or he's thinking about getting a divorce.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we hear.  So, there was a caller on, but he hung up.  It's the 57-year-old mom?  Yeah.  And he was talking about, you know, when she breastfeeds these kids, it's going to come  out like cottage cheese.  But he hung up, man.  It could be the line of the day, but the guy hung up for some reason.  Like space food. 
[01:42:30]  Right.  That they use up in space.  You got to squeeze it, and it's cheese whiz.  Says, all right, this guy doesn't like us or something?  Mike in New Hampshire.  What's up, Mike?  Mike.  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I think I have to go over here now.  Oh, what do you got to do?  Mike, what's going on?  Y'all are really starting to suck.  It's pissing me off that I'm paying money for this shit.  Well, then stop paying.  We don't care.  It's $2 a month, you dumb Jew.  Hang up. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, $2 a month, and I can listen to the same shit on regular radio.  The only thing y'all do different is cuss.  Well, then go listen to your regular radio.  What's the problem, stupid?  Dude, it's $2.  Send your address.  I'll mail you some quarters, and then you can just drop the service.  We don't care.  And your argument stinks because we had a couple having hardcore sex on Friday,  so your whole argument is blown already.  What is your real problem, sir?  What do you want to hear on satellite radio that we're not doing?  Let's listen to Mike and what Mike wants to hear. 
[01:43:30]  Go ahead.  Okay, but I've been listening to y'all every single day since you came on the air.  Since day one.  Day one of what show?  We've been doing radio for 10 years.  The new version of the show?  On XM Radio.  All right, since October.  All right, let's go.  On XM Radio, okay?  Yeah.  All y'all talked about for the first damn week was y'all had no limits.  No limits at all.  And now you're saying you can't play one lively song for the new Eminem album?  Oh, boy.  You really don't get it, do you, stupid?  No, wait.  See, Mike, you just don't understand. 
[01:44:00]  Well, no, no, Mike, you have to listen now while Anthony explains why.  You have to listen to the explanation.  You don't understand that there are certain limits and legal ramifications for playing  music before the release date.  And we're working on it behind the scenes.  See, Mike, Anthony and I sort of learned our lesson.  We were on the top of our careers.  We were syndicated all over the country.  We had one of the hottest radio shows in America.  And we got stupid one day, and it cost us our jobs and two years of our creativity. 
[01:44:30]  So you think with this new gig that we're going to be just a little more careful?  Like, on the old show, I would throw the Eminem on in a second and watch what happens.  But Mike, we have to be careful.  We want to be here for a little while before we start fucking things up.  And that isn't the freedom to do things.  We have the freedom to talk about whatever we want to talk about, not the freedom to come  in here and mow down people with a machine gun.  He might think it's because of the language.  And speaking of being mowed down by a machine gun, we play the new Eminem.  That's exactly what's going to happen to us.  Okay.  Y'all say y'all got the freedom to talk about whatever y'all want. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  Right.  Right.  The only thing I see different than any other radio station is y'all are able to cuss.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I got a prime example.  Mike.  I got a prime example.  All right.  Go ahead.  Prime example.  There's a radio station in Houston, Texas.  K-L-O-L.  K-L-O-L stinks.  Okay.  You just lost your argument right there.  In the afternoon, there's a personality on there by the name of Outlaw Dave and Rock 
[01:45:30]  Stevenhausen.  Oh, Outlaw Dave.  God, Outlaw Dave has just got to be outrageous.  That's one of the biggest names in radio.  Does he shoot a sick shooter after every bit?  They have whores on their show all the time.  Outlaw Dave stinks.  They have pity dancers on their show naked on their website all the time.  They have a webcam.  Dude, if that's what you want from your radio show, go to a strip club, man.  We're doing more than just naked broads on the radio. 
[01:46:00]  And you're done.  Mike, you thought they couldn't play the Eminem song because of the language on it.  They couldn't play it because of the legal release date.  He's thinking that you didn't play it because it's cursing.  Anyone that calls himself Outlaw Dave, that show's got to stink.  And I know it's coming from a guy named Opie, but this is my stupid nickname since I was 12.  I didn't come up with a wacky radio name that would be a lot of fun to listen to.  I'm Outlaw Dave.  Yeehaw.  That guy had to sit around with his pals and go, hey, I need a name for radio.  What do you think?  I'm thinking of calling myself Outlaw Dave. 
[01:46:30]  Dude, you know how stupid you sound on our show today?  Trying to say that some guy named Outlaw Dave is doing outrageous radio on commercial radio.  Hey, let me say one more thing and I'll hang up.  Go ahead.  Gotcha.  Y'all fucking rock, dude.  Y'all are awesome.  Dick.  Y'all rock.  Y'all are awesome.  What about Outlaw Dave? 
[01:47:00]  I still hate that guy.  I don't.  Outlaw Dave?  He likes the show.  Did he really get us?  Yes.  Fuck.  He got us all.  He annoyed all of us.  He had fucking Anthony going over there flipping through the things to find the Outlaw Dave thing.  He actually did annoy us.  Wow, the guy got us completely.  Oh, he got us really good.  I'm all fucking needed, man.  I don't know what it was more annoying than.  For no reason.  The call or the fact that he had a southern accent and he's from New Hampshire.  That really irritated me.  Outlaw Dave is the rarest of commodities.  He's an actual Houston native.  Served with NATO forces in Germany. 
[01:47:30]  And after more than 10 years, his outrageous, irreverent, and provocative show continues to delight.  Getting my blood pressure up for nothing.  All right.  It's the Outlaw Dave show.  With me, Outlaw Dave.  Let me tell you.  Outlaw Dave all summer long.  Outlaw Dave.  Outlaw Dave.  Coming soon.  It will be near you.  Outlaw Dave.  Outlaw Dave.  Outlaw Dave. 
[01:48:00]  Doing NR Radio.  Outlaw Pablo.  This show is tainted, tainted, tainted, tainted.  That guy really got us.  All right.  Enough of that awful music.  Don't you hate being gotten?  Yep.  Yeah.  I was had.  I don't know, man.  I think.  I don't know.  Now you're trying to say that he wasn't getting us?  I think he really meant it.  Then he knew he was losing his argument and he didn't want to look like a douche.  No.  So he turned.  I'm telling you.  Then he decided to, you know, to punch out.  His whole voice changed. 
[01:48:30]  He was like, nah, you guys rock.  Yeah, I disagree.  I think he really did.  He got us, though.  He got us.  Fair and square.  Wait, did he have a regular New Hampshire voice afterward?  It kind of sounded like it, yeah.  So he was doing even the fake Southern thing?  It kind of sounded like his voice changed a little.  Son of a bitch.  Now we have to look out for that with this radio show?  He totally got us.  Oh, boy.  Had us all worked up into a tizzy with the over-the-top arguing back.  No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Let me tell you.  Don't you hate that?  I do hate that.  You were had.  I shushed him so Anthony could finish the explanation.  I know.  He had to be shushed. 
[01:49:00]  All right, we got to move on.  We got Chinese audio.  And we weren't even going to play this because these guys behind the scenes,  Ben and Eric and Steve, thought there was nothing here.  But there's some great stuff here.  I know.  We got to set this up.  We're trying to get, like, the sounds in New York for the rest of the country  because every day there's something just crazy going on in New York.  This is the lamest city to work in because too much stuff happens.  This city is too symbolic of everything.  I think we learned that a couple of years back, didn't we?  It's symbolism. 
[01:49:30]  This whole city is a symbol of what America is all about.  So every idiot that wants to come and protest does it right here.  The problem, it's a place of business.  New York City is a place where people, millions and millions of people come to work every day.  And their work day is sometimes thrown into turmoil.  Their commute, just trying to get to work, do your job, by people that are protesting.  I had to drive up 6th Avenue once.  I can't even tell you how many blocks out of the way. 
[01:50:00]  It might sound selfish of me saying this because people have a problem and they're protesting.  It's this Fallon Gong protest that's going on.  I was going to say, they're not getting sympathy by pissing us off by making us late for work.  There's better ways to do it.  Hands across 6th Avenue thing where they line both sides of the street and kind of hold hands.  And they're in the intersections and everything.  So I could not make a left turn off of 6th.  And I had to drive way out of the way.  Were you beeping?  Oh, I was beeping.  I was flipping the bird.  I had the window down.  I'm yelling. 
[01:50:30]  These were the chinkies?  Yeah.  Same thing we're going to hear audio from.  And they're holding up signs with a Fallon Gong on it.  It says Fallon Gong.  And then it has tortured people's photographs.  History lesson.  Who's he?  Dude, I have no freaking clue.  I actually know what that means.  You know what the Fallon Gong issue is?  Fallon Gong is what SNL has been saying when people call up to ask.  Hey, that's good.  Hey, that's very funny.  Aha.  Fallon Gong.  Let's see.  The artists all practice Fallon Gong, a traditional mind-body discipline from China. 
[01:51:00]  I thought this was a group.  The practice, which emphasizes truth, compassion, and tolerance, cleanses their bodies and allows  their minds to become more tranquil.  They also found that their growing spiritual awareness was having a profound effect on their  outlook and on their art.  In July 99, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party at the time, in response to the growing  popularity of Fallon Gong, started a persecution of global proportions against the spiritual 
[01:51:30]  practice.  So, this isn't even like, this is like yoga?  Is that what I'm understanding?  They're executing people that do yoga.  Yeah, they're torturing people that pretty much are doing yoga.  That's a hell of a cause.  That is a hell of a cause.  Can't you just do the yoga in your house and not make a big issue of it?  What is it?  I don't know, but I can probably agree with the guy who's doing the torturing.  I've never met anyone who does yoga that I like.  You know, and it just frees. 
[01:52:00]  That's nice.  I like how you're able to bend your leg like that.  Can you bend it like this?  Oh, he just got tired of them talking about it at parties.  Oh, shut up.  And it makes me more productive.  It's such a freeing, relaxing experience.  Well, this weekend they were down in Union Square.  Every weekend they're somewhere else, or every day they're somewhere else, right?  Dude, I thought this, let me be honest with you.  I thought, judging by the poster boards and the pictures and the torture, that this had 
[01:52:30]  to be some kind of organization that was trying to overthrow the Communist Party.  I really thought it was some kind of big thing.  It's just people trying to get some kind of spiritual awareness through relaxing.  That's us Chinese, man.  The Chinese government is just completely out of control.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Wow.  I don't know if it's the same group, because I've seen them all over the city.  Opsom and Union Square.  The ones that Eric saw the other day are over here on 6th Avenue by Radio City. 
[01:53:00]  They're all over the place.  I've seen them over on 7th Avenue.  They're everywhere.  You can't miss them.  Yeah.  And they got one guy that's usually in a cage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You ever see the guy in a cage?  Yeah.  Expressionless, just hanging in a cage with fake blood around his mouth and stuff, and  they're looking down on the ground.  And you've got to drive by horrific pictures.  And they're tied in chairs and stuff.  And I just start laughing.  I mean, it's hilarious.  Yeah, they have these huge banners with just the most god-awful pictures of people with lacerations  or a saw being cut through their leg, or one picture is this pregnant lady, and they're 
[01:53:30]  shoving a needle in one side of her belly while they're trying to cut the other side of the  belly while she's pregnant.  Isn't that great?  And we've got to see these pictures as we drive by.  I actually agree.  I like to see those pictures.  I really would.  We sent Eric to go check them out and see what they're all about.  And we've got some audio.  Well, that's the funniest part.  These guys, during the commercial, are like, ah, we've got the Chinese audio.  I don't think there's anything there.  Here's a little something to the protesters. 
[01:54:00]  At protesting anything, wherever you're from, if you're protesting and you're really  screwing up the city and someone asks you what you're protesting about, be able to convey  what you're protesting about.  Pretty much the rule of thumb there.  If you're protesting something, make it so people understand what you're protesting.  Because I have no idea what this broad wants.  No, but let's take a listen.  Maybe we can figure it out together.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Can't speak English?  Some?  Okay. 
[01:54:30]  We're from XM Satellite News.  XM Satellite News.  How do you do it?  Some is Chinese for no.  Speak English?  Some.  XM Satellite News.  XM Satellite News.  XM Satellite News.  We're there first.  News.  News.  News.  Shut up.  All right.  Wait.  I messed it up.  All right.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Can't speak English?  Speak Greek.  Some?  Okay.  We're from XM Satellite News.  We were just questioning about the protests and everything. 
[01:55:00]  We were reading the signs.  We were getting your information, the pamphlets.  Have you been witness to, some of these other people said they knew people who have gone  through these tragedies.  Have you witnessed yourself these tragedies?  Your interview is a tragedy.  It really is.  She's witnessing that tragedy.  Can I offer one criticism?  Can you make the questions longer?  Yeah.  That was a nice, concise question to ask somebody who speaks no English.  Technically, I mean, on the flight over, did you happen to notice that people were being  tortured and not quite?  Jesus.  What type of shenanigans are they involved in over there? 
[01:55:30]  Here's the answer.  Did you say Falun Gong?  Falun Gong comes from China.  From 1992 to 1999, there are over 80 million people who practice Falun Gong in China.  But at that time, the communist leader, Jiang Zemin, feel uneasy just because there are too  many people who practice Falun Gong.  So from 1999, Jiang Zemin started persecuting Falun Gong. 
[01:56:00]  Hello.  From 1999 to today, there are over 1,600 people who are tortured to death just because the petitioner  refused to get up to practice Falun Gong.  So, but in fact, Falun Gong was popular all over the world.  Now, there are over 60 countries who have Falun Gong practitioners, but only in China, Falun 
[01:56:30]  Gong is stopped.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  What was she saying?  Um, she was saying that basically, uh, well, she was, she was like kind of reaffirming  that they deserve what they're getting.  Um, they're being tortured for Falun Gong and also for, um, for feng shui.  Falun Gong, it's in 1999.  You want some Chinese food? 
[01:57:00]  It's in 1992.  We serve a lo mein noodle.  What is she?  I couldn't understand.  She's like a Chinese stalker patty.  I was really trying.  Maybe the, it's so overpopulated, they decided they got to thin the herd a little bit and  they decided to start with the boring zeros.  Yeah, stop whining.  Yeah, stop whining.  That's a lot of people being tortured.  Wow, there's a great...  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  Yes, you are. 
[01:57:30]  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Okay.  Falun Gong.  Falun Gong.  Did you even understand that, Eric?  Nope, I was kind of drifting off.  Yes, a lot of people are tortured and a lot of people are homeless.  What's happening to hot stuff?  They're homeless as well.  Okay, well, that's not really what I asked, but, um...  Getting snippy with her.  Getting a little snippy.  You're like Wolf Blitzer talking to a retard. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, we do have that.  Yeah, I've got to find that now.  All right.  Let's see if I can rephrase this.  Who is your daddy?  Now, I know you're supporting this cause.  You all seem to be very involved.  You have signs and pamphlets that you've been handing out every day to people in the streets  and whatever.  Has anybody in your organization, not just know people or know of what's going on in China,  have they been an actual witness to these acts of brutality?  We come here to Americans, foreign warfare is good, and tell Americans the persecution 
[01:58:30]  of foreign gun in China.  I think everybody, if you know foreign warfare is good, it will give us help.  Foreign gun don't need anybody's money, but everybody could help foreign gun practitioners  in China because a lot of people are tortured in China now.  Oh, yeah.  But you haven't witnessed this firsthand. 
[01:59:00]  First hand.  This hasn't happened to you personally.  Like, you haven't seen it personally, but you're just supporting the cause kind of thing?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh, you stumped her.  I think you might have confused her right there.  You stumped her.  She's got a line.  Like, no matter what you ask, it's, you know, Falun Gong happened in 1999, 1992.  You know, you could shake her up.  So they don't want our money, but they want our support.  So what are we supposed to do?  Take the pamphlet and watch them do the yoga on the side of the road. 
[01:59:30]  That's all they ask you to do.  At this point.  What a dopey thing.  At this point, while Daniel's doing one side of the interviews, I'm doing this, just all  of them heard around us, but not one of them either understands what we're saying or speaks  English to an extent that they can get their point across.  Are they menacing or no?  No, they just come over and, I mean, they're just, they surround you wearing those sandwich  billboards around their necks, showing these horrible pictures, and then there's people  there trying to get you to learn how to do the yoga.  What the hell are you talking about? 
[02:00:00]  Let me see if, okay, you know how the, like here, like here on her shirt right there, they're  showing the different acts of torture, all right?  Have you personally, not just no people who have been through this, or no families and  other citizens of your country have been through this, have you been exposed to this personally?  Have you seen this?  And if you have, can you describe it like, compared to, I mean, you're seeing a poster 
[02:00:30]  with some horrific images, that's one thing, but it's another thing when you've actually  seen it live, it gives you a whole different perspective on it and more intense to try to  convince other people that, holy crap, something really bad is going on here.  Have you witnessed it personally?  Because the, the China's news is close, but a lot of program practitioners in China, if  their family or you, or their friends, or their friends, or their security, they will, they, 
[02:01:00]  they will send the news to the, to, to the other country, when, for example, they will send  the news to, to Minghui Wang.  We're changed for nothing!  I think you need to go back down there and just start yelling at them.  What the fuck are you guys doing?  And what do you want?  Why are you, why are you so polite at this point? 
[02:01:30]  I mean, in their face, like, will you explain, why are you tying up traffic in Manhattan?  I think we should send them back down there for part two of this.  Are they still protesting?  Every day.  Every day.  Where you get in their face and go, what the hell does this mean?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  We'll just do a little more here.  If it goes nowhere, we'll stop.  But I think he needs to go back down there and get a little more aggressive with these  people.  So, we know the news.  So, it was on the news? 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  So, you saw all this because it was on the news.  Okay.  But we, but the Toshio exhibition is the small part of the real teaching action.  The real teaching action is more serious than we, the exhibition.  So, you're, being in America, you're exercising your right to protest to make people aware of  these horrible things that are going on in your home country, correct?  Yes.  The exhibition is going on.  So, so, I think everybody you know, front office is good. 
[02:02:30]  Everybody could help start the persecution of foreign ground in China.  How would you like to move my lawn?  Is this kind of thing going on in the underground in America?  Going.  Are there organizations or members of this organization here of this government?  What kind of question is that?  That are practicing this here in America.  Yes, now, there are over 60 countries who have foreign ground practitioners, including 
[02:03:00]  America.  Okay.  Well, not just pro-tom.  All right.  That's, I think it's safer to practice it here.  He's going for some conspiracy theory.  Right.  Falun Gong members being tortured here in America.  I think our torture list here in America is pretty short.  I don't think Falun Gong's on it.  You want to send him back?  All the ragheads.  We should send you back, and now you get a lot more aggressive.  Yeah.  Why are you protesting over some yoga thing?  You've really got to get aggressive now.  Later on in the audio, one of the guys we were speaking to, all I was doing was correcting 
[02:03:30]  his English the entire time.  I was like, do you know there's no L in Germany, right?  And he's, yeah, and then he, it's like they all have this preset speech in their mind  that they keep repeating over and over because they don't know how to answer anything in  English.  He could have nailed you back just by going, okay, smartass, give me one sentence in Chinese.  Yeah, exactly.  All right?  We're so funny making fun, we're so big making fun of their English.  Yeah, the fact is we only know one language, most of us.  You know what that Chinese language is to speak?  I'm surprised they get two words of English out. 
[02:04:00]  That's a good point because you see these foreigners that speak, you know, broken English.  Yeah, you make fun of me.  Look how stupid he sounds.  Go ahead, give him one sentence in their native tongue.  Yeah, exactly.  Although I will say in Eric's defense for his remark, we don't go to their countries and  just sit there and jerk people off with blank, dumb expressions on our faces.  This is true.  I'm not going, you know, hey, I would protest Bush being elected.  Let me go to China with a sign and start protesting.  I do believe this is a bit in process. 
[02:04:30]  We'll see how the next is in progress.  In progress, sorry.  We'll see how the next one goes.  In progress, and I think Eric needs to go back, and we'll do part two of this where  he gets a little more aggressive trying to understand what the F they're doing, all  right?  You were too polite, but I mean, it's still kind of interesting.  Yeah.  All right?  Sure.  One of the guys we spoke to didn't make any sense, and then he goes, I loved your picture  of Mike Tyson's arm, and he just looked at him and walked away.  Because he didn't get the joke.  He didn't get the joke.  Not at all.  You're just not supposed to ask someone who barely knows English an essay question. 
[02:05:00]  That's from Tony in D.C.  Essay question.  Well, let's see what he comes up with next.  I think it could be interesting as this progresses.  Now available on Norton Records, a heartwarming compilation, a tribute to the mentally disadvantaged,  it's Jim Norton duets.  Straight from the Opie and Anthony show, it's Jim Norton, a preschooler's keyboard and a room 
[02:05:30]  full of retards, singing some of television's greatest hits.  Mr. We Could Use a Hanger If Your Mother Gets Pregnant Again.  D.O.B. and Anthony Show.  If you ran that one into the ground.  That would be a promo.  I had the opportunity to do a movie called Bad Boys.  That was wild for me to play a cop and shit, because I said, man, you know, in the neighborhood, 
[02:06:00]  they be mad at cops.  You know, let's go fuck with people, you know.  Then they show some of them.  You know, you got some good ones out there, you got some bad ones out there.  But they show cops all motherfucking day on TV.  It's like they want to just fuck with you, scare you.  You don't want to, you know, have no peace.  And black people, you know, we could spot a cop.  That's just us.  You know, it's been in our neighborhood so long, we don't get it for, we can be riding  down the street, arguing with our girl.  Fuck it, I ain't trying to hear that old bullshit.  Oh yeah, yeah.  But when a nigga calls, then why didn't you, fuck that old dumb shit. 
[02:06:30]  Look, there's a cop on your left.  Don't say nothing.  There's a cop on your left.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, I love you too.  Okay, I'll take you to Baskin and Robbins.  Come on.  I'll take you to Baskin and Robbins.  Stop it.  It fucks with you though, it's because it's like, it's like black people, we ain't supposed  to, when you watch the story, cops, it's like we ain't supposed to talk back.  You know, it's like, shut up, don't say anything.  Hush your mouth, you're under, shut up.  And you got to go here.  Because brothers, we will try to get out a ticket, won't we? 
[02:07:00]  That's just how cool we are.  Excuse me, is there a problem, officer?  Yeah, well, you just ran that stoplight.  What's that?  Stoplight, what's that?  Stoplight right back there.  Well, officer, last time I looked, the motherfucker was yellow, so I proceed with caution at that  point.  And officer, well, according to my motherfucking eye, you did not proceed with caution.  You damn near just almost hit some homeless back there. 
[02:07:30]  You got to get a ticket.  Fuck, you can't do nothing about it, because it's your word against that.  A white boy scene that could do what they want, man.  I be seeing them all cops.  Cops pull them over.  And they just get bold with them, don't they?  What the fuck did you pull me over for?  I want to know answers.  I want them now.  What the fuck did you pull me over for?  You were speeding, sorry.  You were goddamn right I was speeding.  You're fucking right I was speeding. 
[02:08:00]  I'm in a fucking rush, you fuck.  You ain't got nothing better to do.  Get the fuck out my face and let me go.  My mom will have your ass.  Then they seem to get on.  Cop, all right, well, then slow down, be careful.  Yeah, fuck you, you be careful.  I remember Whitey used to, the insurance man, when they come down, no, motherfucker, I don't  have no money.  Well, all we meant was, if you just could give us 15 cents or something like that toward 
[02:08:30]  the policy, look, motherfucker, I said I didn't have a quarter.  Now get your ass away from out here.  If you die, you get $300, you're going to get it.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, yes.  Oh, that's Rock King Friday.  Work the taint.  Oh, Mr. Rogers is about to come in your fist hole.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she know.  I'm not a light.  I'm not a mother.  It's this day.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she know.  I'm not a light.  I'm not a light.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:09:30]  The start of week six.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I can tell you, friends, if you're enjoying what you're hearing, we interrupt this program  for the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Oh, we have a midget sighting?  Let's say hi to Brian in Florida, man.  Well, yeah.  What's up, Brian?  Oh, headed down the road here on I-95.  I had a couple things.  I was the one that called in about that 57-year-old lady having the twins.  Yeah.  Imagine this thing.  If she makes it through the hatching of these demons spawn, they'll pitch swell up. 
[02:10:00]  She's going to have stuff like cottage cheese and buttermilk coming out of them things.  All right.  We took your line because you're hung up.  We got that one already.  Yeah.  All right.  What's the midget sighting all about?  Yeah, the midget blew my doors off going south here on I-95.  I'm getting on down through here pretty good.  And I looked in the mirror and this car came up on me, and I happened to look when it went  by.  I see these four little sticks about a foot long, two holding a wheel and two trying  to push pedals going down the road about 90 miles an hour. 
[02:10:30]  Now, how does a fidget reach the pedals?  I have no idea.  I couldn't tell because it went by too fast.  Oh, there's big blocks on them?  It's special fidget pedals, I think.  They're riding an old Buick celebrity, like an 80s model celebrity, out in the left lane  getting on down through here.  We find the midget thing very interesting.  Some of them use hand controller.  I've seen people that are paralyzed.  They have a hand controller that works like a motorcycle throttle.  It's a bar that comes off your steering wheel.  It works like a motorcycle throttle. 
[02:11:00]  You turn the handle in order to work the gas, and then you push it forward to work the  brake with their little midget feet just sticking straight out from the seat.  The soles of their shoes pointing at the dashboard.  One other thing, I wasn't going to cuss on the show this morning, but that idiot-ass caller  that called in the last one crying about you guys' show, he ain't got nothing better to  do.  He just needs to go get a real life, man.  I tell you, you guys got fired two years ago. 
[02:11:30]  He got us.  Yeah, but, sir, watch out with those harsh criticisms.  He needs to go get a real life.  Take it easy, fella.  He didn't do anything that serious.  Wow, should he go jump in the leg, too, while he's at it?  Easy, you.  Take a flying leap.  You guys got, you know, you got him paying two bucks a month to listen to you, and he's  going to cry about you, big sidewalk sissy.  All right.  He's back listening to Stern or something, you know.  When you guys got fired, there was nothing on the radio.  All right.  Then I found Bubba for Love.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  I know it's lonely on the road, Brian, but thank you.  Thank you.  We're glad to have you back.  All right.  There he goes, Brian.  Bye.  That's what everyone says about the truckers.  I know.  Guys, they love to talk.  They love to talk.  There's nothing else out there.  They love to talk.  Speaking of killing yourself.  Ain't got time for no jibber-jabber.  Listen to this zero.  Yeah.  Anger at World Trade Center.  Suicide.  9-11 families react.  Families of 9-11 victims yesterday reacted with shock, sympathy, and anger after a Georgia  man killed himself at Ground Zero on his 25th birthday because he was distraught over 
[02:12:30]  President Bush's re-election.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  I don't even know what his name is.  Andrew Veal?  Vincent.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Is that really his name?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Happy birthday, dear Vincent.  Happy birthday to you. 
[02:13:00]  He's the birthday boy.  He's the attention getter is what he is.  That's an attention getter.  That is an attention getter.  So, obviously, the 9-11 family is very, very pissed off at this.  The suicide victim, Andrew Veal, was discovered on a concrete slab in the construction pit  near the Church Street subway entrance Saturday morning.  A bottle of Jack Daniels was by his side.  There's some good advertising.  Before you cash it in.  And a 12-gauge shotgun lay across his body. 
[02:13:30]  Ow.  Authorities believe that Veal, who was engaged to be married, killed himself sometime Friday,  his birthday, friends said.  Engaged to be married, huh?  Friends also said he may have killed himself to protest the war.  Took the easy way out.  In Iraq.  Yeah.  Well, speaking of...  We'll segue into the next story about being married and hating your life.  Protests in the war in Iraq.  Iraq, he cared about politics, people, and the state of the world.  Sure, he did.  He cared. 
[02:14:00]  Can I say that I really wish that a lot of other liberal John Kerry supporters would  follow his lead?  I think that's a fine example he's setting.  You should all put shotguns in your mouths.  Bleeding heart douches.  Well, the guy definitely made a statement.  That's the new trend, by the way.  What?  When we were off the air for a while.  Shotgun in the mouth?  No, no.  Just killing yourself at some of these places.  Like Dealey Plaza.  Someone went on the X.  I mean, Jim had a whole joke about that, but now you can't use that joke anymore because 
[02:14:30]  someone actually did what you talk about in your act.  Guy went on right where Kennedy took it, bit it on the X, and killed himself.  I'm surprised more people haven't gone down to the 9-11 site down there and done it.  Just seems like one of those things that if you're kind of unstable, you would kind of  want to do.  Go down there, blow your brains out down there.  You know, makes you a part of something that was huge.  I skate the Westside bike path, and I usually go all the way to Ground Zero and then back  uptown. 
[02:15:00]  It's still brutal, man.  I'm there, I don't know, maybe every two, three months I take a peek, and it's still  just horrendous.  It's all business now.  It's all business.  Well, it is all business.  Put down the cornerstone and let's build the building back up.  It's a huge, yeah, construction site now, but I mean, you've still got the people coming  from all over the world still.  Oh, the tourists that like snapping little pictures in front of it?  Go home.  Well, that's what pisses me off.  You get these people, you know, get a shot.  Get a picture of me in front of the big construction ditch.  I've heard people go, did I look good? 
[02:15:30]  You want to take it again?  Let me see.  Let me see the digital.  No, let's do that one again.  It doesn't look, it doesn't look Ground Zero-ish enough.  Can we take a picture from this angle?  Eh, out of here.  Build those things up as quick as you can.  And I'm a little tired of some of the, what is it, the association of victims' families  or whatever.  You know, build the frigging buildings back up.  That's the best thing.  They'll keep this open wound reminder there.  Some people just love being sad and being miserable and remembering horrific things 
[02:16:00]  in their life.  You know, move on.  Let's build those things up.  We've got to live with it, too.  That big open ditch down there as they argue what's supposed to be there.  Should we preserve the footprints of the original towers?  What does that mean?  Who cares?  Well, the families, they care.  What does it mean if you preserve the space that the buildings used to be in?  The families care.  Because they feel like it's a gravesite.  Put them back up. 
[02:16:30]  Put something there.  I thought they should just rebuild the buildings exactly the same.  Yeah, just make it like it never happened.  Well, that would be good.  Not exactly the same.  I mean, make changes as far as, you know, safety goes.  But when you're looking at it from the street, it's the exact same building.  No, they'll put the Freedom Tower there.  Well, they'll never be able to rent them.  And that's why no company would put their workforce on the floor.  Yeah, they would.  Give them enough time.  Enough time goes by.  People don't care about anything.  It's like, yeah, people will never put ships in that Pearl Harbor again.  Let me tell you that. 
[02:17:00]  You could come back in 2004.  That harbor will be empty.  No one's going to put any Navy ships in there.  Ah, still there.  People forget.  Time goes on.  They'd rent them.  You know why?  It's a great fucking view.  You ever been up at that Windows of the World restaurant?  Oh, it's a great view.  People love it.  It'd go away.  There's too much politics, too much personal stuff involved.  It's business.  Pour the concrete.  Get moving again.  It's a constant reminder when you drive past there. 
[02:17:30]  American flags, signs on the street, the old tower pictures, a big ditch that for some  reason is still a big ditch.  Build it.  Tourists with their cameras that ought to be just being shot.  I'm tired of it.  That stuff was from day one, too, with the people coming down there.  Oh, I know.  When we were working.  Oh, celebrities.  It was the in place for celebrities to go for a while.  You know what?  I'm going to tell you a story that I never told you guys, but the best celebrity story,  a buddy of mine that we worked with.  This is Keith the Cop, by the way.  Yeah, that miserable cunt, Susan Sarandon, showed up down at Ground Zero with a stack 
[02:18:00]  of cheap Domino's pizzas one day for her photo op with all her people and stuff like  that.  And a good buddy of mine stopped her right at the fence and said, no, I'm sorry, you're  not allowed in.  Good.  Because that's what the celebrities felt like.  Well, we bring pizza to the guys.  Yeah.  They'll let us in.  It was a photo op.  And we could get our photos taken at Ground Zero.  Yeah.  That's what they did.  They came in for a photo op, these celebrities.  So you let her in. 
[02:18:30]  No, he's one of my favorite people in the world.  One of the proudest moments to see that cunt get turned away with those pizzas.  How big did her eyes get in surprise?  You're not letting me in?  I'm Susan Sarandon.  Yeah.  I said, I'm sorry, I'm not allowing you in.  Good.  Good for him.  Good, good.  She was probably bringing the pizzas just in case any of the hijackers survived.  Might need a bite to eat.  That bitch.  Yeah, now it's a photo op for tourists.  They go down there. 
[02:19:00]  Take a picture.  She couldn't believe that they wouldn't let her in, though.  She's like, it's astounding.  Let's try to move on.  Say hi to Tally.  Hey, Tally.  Yes, hello.  What's going on, Tally?  Not much.  Just trying to get some extra money here.  You're trying to get some extra money.  Of course.  What do you need?  Yeah.  Who are you calling?  Okay.  I was told to call A&J Contracting from Mr. Alan Tara.  He's now employed as a, I guess, a coach or whatever it is he's doing over there in Brooklyn. 
[02:19:30]  Alan?  Yeah, of course.  We know Alan very well.  Okay.  And he applied for a job?  He applied for one and he got it.  Okay.  So why are you calling us then?  He told me to give you a call because he was under the impression that they needed more managers to come back.  And I was a manager.  All right.  What are your qualifications?  Oh, so you're trying to get a job.  What are my qualifications?  Yes.  34 years in the company.  I was a teacher at 18th Street.  Installer repairman. 
[02:20:00]  What type of tools do you work with, sir?  What type of tools do I work with?  What type of tools are you familiar with working with?  Hand tools that are normal installer repairman with juice.  For installing?  Telephone lines, telephone loops that's from the pole to the house or from a basement up to an office or whatever.  Are you good at climbing a ladder?  Of course, yeah.  You don't have an extra weight on you or anything that can hinder you getting up and down the ladders.  Not a problem.  You union?  Who?  You union? 
[02:20:30]  I'm not getting what that gentleman's saying.  The union?  You in the union?  No, no, no, no.  I was a manager.  Managers don't have a union.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, the managers don't have the union.  Right.  Oh, yes, yes.  That's right in front of me now that I look.  I see that they're not.  Big cock.  Big cock.  How big is your cock?  Do you have a big cock?  How big is your cock?  Excuse me? 
[02:21:00]  Do you have a big cock?  Someone's making sport of me here.  Do you have a big cock?  Excuse me?  Someone's making sport of me here.  I'm hearing whispers in the background.  What are you hearing?  We've been having trouble with our phone lines.  What's the whispering you hear?  I don't hear anything.  I have no idea.  It seems like they're talking about some private parts.  What?  That's what I'm hearing.  We've had problems with the phone lines here.  Yeah, because actually they have you listed under one number and that number does not exist.  Yeah, we've had complaints that the lines get crossed with some kind of, I don't know, 
[02:21:30]  like one of those 1-900 sex lines.  I'm being made sport of here.  No, not at all.  Sport.  So, when can you start working?  I don't know.  What's available?  Do you have a hairy cock?  What type of pay are you looking for?  I was told it was the same pay that I got out with approximately $1,200 to $1,300 a week.  $1,300 a week?  Yeah, you got it.  How big is that cock?  Wow.  That's a little on the high side there, Tally. 
[02:22:00]  Well, my talents are, you know, good.  You know, we haven't really been paying more than a grand.  Are you a pitcher or a pitcher?  Well, it's negotiable.  I could use some extra crystal.  Do you have big hangers?  You could work with that?  Yes, I could.  Do you have big balls?  You'd be okay with that?  A thousand?  Yeah.  And you're looking for the manager of a position?  Well, yeah, I was under the understanding that it was going to be, I would be training  or, you know, like helping with fiber to the curb and things like that. 
[02:22:30]  Have you ever managed people?  Yes.  Tell me more about your big cock.  I want to suck it.  How many men have you managed at one time?  Forty-five.  Forty-five?  How big were their cocks?  Well, that's bigger than any crew you'd be managing here, to tell you the truth.  How many of those men did you suck off?  Wow.  Okay, I guess I'll play.  All right. 
[02:23:00]  So do you want the job or what, sir?  Of course.  Will you suck a cock for the job?  All right.  I'm looking at your requirements for this job.  You do seem like you're qualified.  Do you like your ass being eaten?  This is nuts.  Am I the air?  What do you mean this is nuts? 
[02:23:30]  I said, am I on the air?  What air?  Because I'm getting this thing.  I was listening to your broadcast.  Matter of fact, I listened to it the other week.  Last week, I'm sorry to say.  What?  It's like two hours, the Opie show or whatever it is.  The Opie show?  What the hell is that?  It's like a talk show, sort of like an Imus or whatever you will.  We've never heard of the Opie show, sir.  We're trying to fill this job position.  Uh-huh.  We know our phone lines are, there's some problem with that. 
[02:24:00]  So we're trying to get some professionals in here that could take care of that problem.  Uh-huh.  And you look like you could be qualified for that position.  Uh-huh.  So, do you want the gig or not?  Oh, yes.  What do I have to do here?  You've got to suck a big cock.  And it's not white.  When will you be available?  Um, I guess Monday.  Oh.  Take the rest of the week off, huh?  Well, I've been off for a year now, so a week is not going to really matter. 
[02:24:30]  Lazy piece of shit.  Well, before I got my job, I was off for two years.  Sorry to hear that.  Yeah.  Are you a scab?  Am I a scab?  Never happened.  All right.  We're making sure we don't hire scabs here.  Never happened.  As a matter of fact, I was in the 71 strike.  We struck for seven months.  Yeah, no scabs at this place, you know.  Not happening yet.  Monster Rain.  Have you ever played Monster Rain with big cocks?  Yeah, no scabs here, sir, at all. 
[02:25:00]  Works for me.  Good.  Good.  Suckers.  All right.  Sounds pretty good.  Do you have a number that we could get back to you, or?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, hold off on that.  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, I was going to do that because, you know, like, this thing's going to blow up here.  I'm feeling that, you know.  What do you mean it's going to blow up?  Well, like, if I put my number out there, any and every is going to blow up my phone line.  So, uh, I think I'll hold off on that.  All right.  Uh, hold on there, sir, okay? 
[02:25:30]  Tally, right?  Yeah, you got it.  All right.  We're going to give Tally a job.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye, you cocksucker.  All right.  Um, where were we?  Can you, uh, can you get me off the hook for all time's sake?  Can't do it, Tally.  You want to do this, uh, this, uh, this Groton Man story real fast?  That's what we're getting into.  Oh, everyone can understand this.  Anyone who's been married.  And this guy was married for, uh, 29 years. 
[02:26:00]  29 years.  The guy was 51 years, is 51 years old.  Married 29 years.  Do a little math, Opie.  Um, 29 years.  How old was he when he, uh, when he got married?  Um, how old is he now?  51.  Married 29 years.  He got young, he got married too young.  So, now, you're a 22-year-old guy, right?  You should not be getting married at 22 years old. 
[02:26:30]  What?  23?  23.  I'm sorry.  From, look at us with our math skills.  Wait, how old is he?  Well, it's subtraction.  That is a tough one.  Wait, how old is he?  Uh, 51.  And he got married at 22.  That, that's 29 years.  Why are you saying 23 years?  Yeah, why are you saying 24?  Jesus.  I swear to God, I swear to God.  He jumps in with a correction, and it's wrong.  My English stinks, and your math stinks.  No, no, no.  I forgot to put it on the other side.  Oh, wow.  I practiced the puts all weekend long. 
[02:27:00]  All right, sorry.  All right.  So, you know, you're 22 years, 21 years old.  How old?  22 years old.  And, uh, now from 22 to 51, you have this woman that is just telling you what to do all  the time, ragging you.  And he finally lost his mind.  A Groton man, Groton, Connecticut, charged with murder in the death of his wife, told police  that he ran her over in their driveway because she berated and nagged him. 
[02:27:30]  Berated and nagged him.  But that happens to a lot of couples.  It does.  It does.  It certainly does.  And this guy, uh, couldn't take it anymore.  His description is a classic of what happened.  Blakeslee, um, 51, said that on September 10th, his wife, Christine, nagged him about  a motor vehicle ticket he'd received several weeks earlier.  Oh, okay.  I'm starting to feel this story. 
[02:28:00]  He said his wife of 29 years would not drop the matter.  Oh, have you been in this, people?  How many times have I told you to slow down?  They're going to take it, but you won't slow down.  Yeah.  What happens?  When does it turn into this, by the way?  I don't know.  You always, like, uh, I don't know, you start dating someone, it's all about sex, and, uh,  you can't do no wrong, she can't do no wrong.  But slowly but surely, all, like, relationships creep into this type of a situation.  Opie, this is after 29 years. 
[02:28:30]  That's what I mean, but it slowly creeps.  You don't really notice it, uh, happening, you know?  I was in a relationship for a while.  I'm not going to, no, no, I'm not going to mention any names.  I'm going to go get coffee.  Who, what, where?  No names or anything, but I got to tell you, being ragged on and bitched at is not a fun  thing.  Like not doing your vacuuming before I pick you up?  Right.  All that kind of fun stuff.  I used to, oh, wow.  I want, no, no, no.  Can I tell one story?  What?  I used to, we, Ed and I used to commute, because we lived in the same town when we first moved 
[02:29:00]  back to New York.  Beautiful Huntington, New York.  Yeah, and I, uh, picked up, uh, Anthony, you know, and we'd, we'd take turns, like, commuting  in and then taking turns driving and stuff.  I'll drive today.  Oh, and, um, I would pick up Anthony around, I don't know, let's say about 10.  It was pretty accurate, right?  After rush hour, we decided to come in for our afternoon show, get some things done, maybe  meetings or whatever.  And I'm thinking, Anthony is not a morning person.  So, if I'm picking him up at 10, he had to have gotten up maybe 9, 9, 15.  Yep.  Seriously.  Absolutely. 
[02:29:30]  And I would pick up Anthony, and this was more than once.  Like, Anthony would be at the front door, and his ex would be yelling and screaming at  him.  Yeah.  Yelling and screaming at him.  And I would get pissed off, and he would get in the car, and I'm like, what could you  have possibly done wrong?  I know you've only been up for 45 minutes, maybe an hour.  You know how much stuff you could do wrong in 45 minutes?  Are you kidding?  Do you know the earth-shattering messes you can concoct in 45 minutes?  I remember one time it was because you didn't vacuum. 
[02:30:00]  I used to smile when I walked out to get into that car to come to work.  Oh, would I smile.  I was done for the day.  And then I...  O.P. in his Funmobile showing up at your house, like, whew!  Yeah.  Whew!  Here we go.  And then after the show, I would hang out and play video games until all hours of the  night.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You know what?  I know.  Yeah.  No.  Meeting.  I got to take a wait.  Yeah.  Another meeting.  Oh, this one's going on and on.  I don't know.  You know, we got to meet with people again. 
[02:30:30]  You know, we got in trouble, but I'll be home.  I'll be...  I'll be home in, like, November.  Is that okay?  Why did I pick the month it is?  What an idiot.  What a fucking idiot.  And none of us noticed.  For this bit, the day is September 19th.  Yeah.  But I remember one time you came into the car.  I'm like, what'd you do wrong?  Well, I was supposed to vacuum before I left for work.  I think I was supposed to take out the garbage or something. 
[02:31:00]  That was it.  I think that was my job.  All right.  Something like that.  But I won't mention any names of this relationship, but it was just a constant ragging.  And there were times where we would go out.  And this girl would get a little intoxicated, Hopi.  A little drunk.  Sorry.  I had something in my mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I would say, before we even went out, I would say, look.  I'm going to check my messages.  I think someone might have called while we were on break. 
[02:31:30]  Please.  I'm begging you.  Even after you're drunk, try to keep this in your head.  Whatever you're going to start arguing about isn't important and does not need to be pursued.  Does not even need.  So, we're going out to have fun.  It's going to be fun.  Let's go out.  We'll tip a few back.  But keep it light and airy and fun.  Sure.  There's nothing to argue about.  And there's nothing to argue about right now, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, nothing important is going to happen while we're out drinking. 
[02:32:00]  So, let's remember that and keep it.  Let's fast forward four hours.  I'll say four hours.  You motherfucker.  No, no.  Because you don't clean.  I do every fucking thing.  All right.  And I'm like, remember the conversation?  Do you remember?  You fuck yourself.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:32:30]  I'm going to be sitting over here for a while.  I'm in living hell.  This is unbelievable.  And, you know, occasionally you do get it in your mind.  If she was in front of my car, would I put it in drive, as this gentleman in this article did, and maybe hit the gas?  We're getting back to that story?  Oh, that's where we were the whole time.  Oh, okay.  Well, can I ask a question?  Yes.  If you're dating someone and you feel that they're drinking too much, wouldn't you say, like, maybe you shouldn't drink before we go out?  No.  No, no.  Can I say something else?  If she's not drinking. 
[02:33:00]  Can I add?  And I'm not drinking.  And I had a drink.  Can I say something else?  Yeah.  She would call while we were on the air because it was happy hour time.  Because we did three to seven.  And I remember phone calls where you would beg her not to get too drunk before you got there.  No shots.  No shots till I get there.  And it's this big radio star, and he's begging this certain individual not to get too hammered before he got there.  I had to.  Christine Blakesley, 54, was bitching about the parking ticket he'd received several weeks earlier. 
[02:33:30]  He said his wife of 29 years would not drop the matter, so he decided to get in his truck and leave.  It's a pretty rational thing for a guy to do, leave the situation.  Christine Blakesley, the wife, followed him, climbed up on the running board.  He drove the truck in reverse, causing his wife to fall.  Now, under normal circumstances, that would be a waker-upper right there.  You'd go, holy jeez, she just fell off the running board. 
[02:34:00]  Things got out of hand.  Let me see if she's okay.  You know, she was ragging me and stuff.  Things got out of hand.  Now, this should pretty much take care of the problem.  He's quoted as saying,  I stopped the truck and looked out in front of me.  Picture this scene.  Blakesley said in his statement,  My wife was there in the headlights.  She was kneeling with her hands in front of her.  Small pause.  I stepped on the gas. 
[02:34:30]  How great is that?  I stepped on the gas.  She never looked up.  I just wanted to make her stop.  I didn't think about the consequences.  He just wanted to make it stop. 
[02:35:00]  That voice in his head.  Just make it stop.  That voice.  Parking ticket.  Back, back.  Stop, back.  I told you.  I told you so.  Just holding on to the running board.  Probably turned and looked at her face, pressed against the window.  What are you doing?  I told you.  Where are you going?  Get back here.  I stepped on the gas.  She never looked up.  I just wanted to make her stop.  I didn't think about the consequences.  I heard a thud. 
[02:35:30]  Then I thought I heard her scream.  I didn't stop right away.  I stopped when it came to me that I hit her.  I kept thinking,  Oh my God.  I just killed my wife.  He said he returned to the house.  And what did he do afterwards, Opie?  Did he call 911?  Did he check on her?  Did he freak out?  He went to sleep.  He finally could sleep.  It was finally quiet. 
[02:36:00]  First night of peaceful sleep.  And I'll tell you another.  Wait, she's like just dead in the driveway?  She's dead in the driveway.  He's snoozing away.  Let me tell you another treat that some guys have to go through.  The I gotta go to sleep, but there's a fight going on.  You're in bed.  You have to get up for work.  You're in bed.  Is this a real story?  Trying to sleep.  Or this is something that you've heard?  Let's just say I might be familiar with this certain situation.  All right, I'm going to go sit back over here for a while.  Well, there's been a drunken argument. 
[02:36:30]  You're trying to rationalize, but it's like rationalizing with a pumpkin or a porcupine  or a cactus.  You know, try to rationalize with it.  It's not going to listen.  So you finally decide it's time for bed.  It's time for bed.  You gotta sleep.  My God, you gotta sleep.  It's six in the morning, and you're going to bed.  Climb into bed.  You're all aggravated, but maybe you could just relax long enough and go to sleep. 
[02:37:00]  From downstairs.  Fucking idiot.  Son of a bitch.  Why the...  Son of a bitch.  Prick.  Goddamn son of a bitch.  Never listened to a fucking word.  I...  Dang it.  Son...  Motherfucker.  Now you're trying to sleep.  Holy ass.  Even Jim's uncomfortable.  Now you're trying to sleep.  And this is all going on, and you're trying.  I hate these stories.  And you think in your head, do I just lay here and hopefully fall asleep, or it's a fine line. 
[02:37:30]  Do I wake up and continue this argument that now we'll put it into hyperdrive?  Can I throw something else into this mix?  Yes, yes.  When that's going on and you're upstairs, part of you's got to be thinking, she might stab me.  Yeah, there were some times you would actually think something might happen.  Yeah, yeah.  All kinds of thoughts go through your head.  But, you know, the best thing is to stay in bed and try to go to sleep.  Because you've tried them all before.  You tried all the... 
[02:38:00]  You get up and continue trying to rationalize.  It just goes on and on.  It doesn't end.  And then, when you finally do sleep, and she sleeps and everyone wakes up, it never happened.  Hey, how you doing?  Morning!  Morning!  You're living with, what's her name, from Misery.  And then, oh.  Kathy Bates.  Yeah, Kathy Bates.  Hey!  A young version of Kathy Bates.  Morning!  Morning! 
[02:38:30]  Oh, you!  And you're like, where's Opie?  Beat the horn, Opie, please.  Hong Kong!  Oh, I gotta go!  Oh, it's time for work.  You know I was your savior, right?  Why are you leaving at 8 a.m.?  You haven't acknowledged lately that I was your savior.  What?  You just haven't acknowledged it lately.  I want to hear it today.  I'd have probably left sooner if it wasn't for you and Sandy.  I was your savior.  I'm not going to say that.  You were my savior as far as work goes. 
[02:39:00]  Get me this kick-ass job in radio.  But I brought fun back into your life.  I'm really assessing this.  Hold on.  You gave me the cool job in radio.  No, just the opportunity and the rest is history.  Having nothing to do with any relationships I've been in.  I don't think that really fits, Opie.  I don't know, because I don't think you would ever get divorced.  Are you insane?  Well, you talked about how you couldn't get divorced for a while there. 
[02:39:30]  Why?  Wait, how many...  Didn't you want to get divorced way before you did?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  And I didn't because I had a kick-ass job in radio.  Hmm.  I don't get it.  Well, it was just kind of a good distraction.  Well, that's what I mean.  I was your savior.  Or my curse.  If you think of it that way, I would have been out of it.  You think?  Perhaps earlier.  It was a good distraction.  I was having a good time away from the house.  Well, that's what I mean by the savior part.  I gave you a nice distraction. 
[02:40:00]  Because it's the blood on your hands and on your feet, stigmata?  My savior?  Well, no.  This is what the point I'm getting at is that I think I know you well enough to know that  you realized early on that you weren't in the greatest relationship, right?  Yeah.  But you also had a shitty job.  So you had a shitty job.  Then you had this going on at home.  Yeah.  But then you got into radio, so at least it gave you fun, fun, fun.  And a distraction.  I think I'd have walked away from the entire situation earlier.  The job, the woman, everything, if I was still in that crappy job. 
[02:40:30]  Hmm.  Okay.  I think it would have really...  Who knows?  So what happened to the Blakesleys?  By the way, can I say that Robert Blake's wife's last name was Blakely?  Ooh.  How coincidental is that?  None whatsoever.  Not funny or interesting either.  As I said it, that's...  Good job, flow stopper.  An autopsy report ruled Christine Blakesley, a death, ruled her death a homicide, saying  she died of blunt, forced chest trauma.  Oh, man. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, hit her right in the chest with a bumper.  Not only did he hit her, he hit her.  He's like, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to make it look good.  He went to the house, went to sleep, told police he woke up, checked the driveway, saw  his wife was still there, and called 911.  I didn't want to face what happened, he said.  I was hoping it was all a bad dream.  Yeah, a 29-year bad dream.  She jumped on the running board.  She's bitching about a ticket.  You fucking bitch.  And he realized he'd killed his wife, he tried to commit suicide by drinking and taking Tylenol. 
[02:41:30]  What's that going to do?  In his second version, he told police he woke up early in the morning, heard a car breaking,  then a thud, looked out a window, and saw a light-colored car driving away.  Blakesley told police he returned to bed and noticed that his wife was gone, said he found  her dead in the driveway.  How are you going to say that when there's a dent in your car because you hit your wife?  Her hair is in your bumper. 
[02:42:00]  What a foolish thing.  At least say you saw a light-colored car with a black guy in it driving away.  Oh, it wasn't in Boston.  Okay.  It was in Connecticut.  I am sorry.  I didn't want to kill her.  I just wanted her to stop.  That's what it says.  Ladies, do some thinking.  Do some thinking.  Are you an egg?  Are you ragging your husband?  Are you constantly just pecking away at his head? 
[02:42:30]  But in the beginning, it's just not like that.  But something happens slowly but surely, and then you wake up one day and realize, oh, my  God, I'm in a nightmare.  Opie, sometimes you can find the right person you get along with, you can chat with, and  it's wonderful.  But when you're in a situation, you're in a relationship like that, you've got to get  out.  You've got to run, because it's going to end up, she will either kill you through the  nagging, or you will see her in the headlights, on her knees, hands in front of her, and you 
[02:43:00]  know what choice you'll make?  The little skinny pedal on the right.  We haven't played this in a couple days.  We're not going to break, though.  I just want to play this really fast.  Oh, I love this.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  You wouldn't get away with it here.  But you should.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  She spilled my coffee. 
[02:43:30]  The little laugh is the greatest.  The little chuckle, because he knows what's coming.  He's laughing because he's the only one that knows what's coming.  I'm sorry, sir.  That coffee-spilling bitch has no clue she's getting that in the face.  Her just desserts.  Janine, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I just want to say that you guys are making me want to leave my husband out of an act  of mercy.  Why?  Do you rag him?  I hate me right now.  Are you a rag?  A nag?  I don't want to be. 
[02:44:00]  I don't want to be.  I don't think I have a choice, though.  It's in our nature.  Why?  Why don't you have a choice?  Because he's a guy, and he does stupid guy things, and I just can't let go.  Sometimes those stupid guy things we do at the beginning of the relationship were called  cute.  Yeah, they were called cute, and I used to want to keep him in my closet and take him out  and look at him because he was so funny, and now I just want to lock him in there.  And I'm sure he wants to kill me half the time.  And the things you guys rag about, they used to not be that big an issue. 
[02:44:30]  And then slowly they become this big issue that needs to be addressed on a minutely basis.  Your clothes are on the floor.  I suck.  They totally suck.  And on Halloween, I was jumping up and down yelling because he refused to put on his mask.  I'm a dick.  See, those are things, if you don't want to put on a mask, he don't put on a mask.  You know what?  I used to get ragged at all the time at weddings.  Come on, let's dance. 
[02:45:00]  Let's get up and dance.  And I'm like, I don't want to dance.  I want to sit here.  I want to finish my drink.  And I just want to sit here and watch everyone else dance because they look like drunken buffoons.  Get up and dance.  Why don't you ever dance?  And then the arm pull where you got to hold onto your seat.  Now it's assault.  I don't want to dance.  And it's just ragged.  Neek, deek, deek.  Pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting uncomfortable.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I hate these flashbacks. 
[02:45:30]  I just hate.  This is the only time.  Poor guy doesn't want to put his mask on and you're yelling at him.  Yelling at him.  What kind of mask was it?  What kind of mask?  It was a stupid burglar mask.  It was the only thing I could get him to wear because it was cheap and easy.  But he's a musician and I try to do everything for him.  So then when it's my time, I have to insist that it goes my way and I'm just an asshole.  What kind of burglar mask?  Like one around the eyes or one around the mouth?  Like a hamburglar?  I think every marriage should end after seven years.  Think seven years? 
[02:46:00]  Seven years.  That's it.  I think there should be an option.  Like you go a few years and you have an option to re-up your marriage license.  You got to get it.  You know, it could expire.  You laugh, but it's not a bad idea.  If both parties are in agreeance, you re-up your marriage license for another couple of years.  Instead of like signing that marriage certificate and now you're stuck for life because all the women get all the money and stuff when you do finally divorce.  You can't get a lifetime fishing license.  Right.  And that's for a fish.  Right.  But you could get a wife and it's a lifetime license that never expires. 
[02:46:30]  Who stays in one job for 40 years?  No one.  Exactly.  Why do you have to stay with the same person for 40 years?  You do.  Because you said it.  Marriage in this day and age just doesn't make sense anymore.  No.  It just doesn't.  Thanks to you guys, I'm going to drive away and I'm never going to look back and he'll hear it on the replay.  And honey, I'm sorry I'm doing this because I love you.  Do you like sucking?  I'm going.  Leave him alone.  Yeah, leave him alone, man.  Or be a friend.  Be a chick that's interesting. 
[02:47:00]  Do something like cup of fart and throw it in his face.  I love you for that.  Do something silly.  There you go.  I'll learn to gag more.  Nice.  Yeah, that's nice.  We like when you gag just a little bit.  You should have said, put the mask on, honey.  Hobble.  Yeah.  I told you the girl that would put the bucket by the side of my...  Yes.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Janine.  I'll learn to gag.  Thank you.  Oh, you remember the ice cream.  Good memory.  I like Anthony's...  I like your suggestion there, man.  Yeah.  A whole license.  Renewal.  Have a marriage license with an expiration on.  It's not a bad idea. 
[02:47:30]  Let's say hi to Keith in Cincinnati.  How about those Bengals, Keith, huh?  That looked good yesterday.  They kicked the Cowboys' ass 26-3.  Well, maybe if we didn't have a 50-year-old quarterback, that wouldn't happen.  Well, you guys got rid of the Coke guy.  I didn't.  Parcells did.  That's dope.  What was his name again?  Quincy Carter.  Yeah, Quincy.  Vinny with three interceptions.  Vinny stinks.  Dude, we knew Vinny was awful when he was with the Jets.  That's how you build an offense.  Take someone from the Jets.  What's the matter?  Wasn't Daryl Stingley available? 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Wow.  But he's in a wheelchair, Jimmy.  Yeah, I was calling just to rule out.  You're talking about nagging women.  I'm getting ready to go through a divorce myself, and I was married to the naggingest bitch  on the face of the earth.  Yeah, but it didn't...  Hold on.  But it didn't start like that, right?  I'm sorry?  It didn't start like that, right?  I still didn't pick that up.  Your line is really distorting on my end.  Your relationship didn't start like that with her nagging. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, hell no, no.  Maybe this guy needs to be nagged, too.  You just had to tell him three fucking times.  He doesn't listen.  It's a right pedal versus a middle pedal.  Trust me, I can relate to it, but I would never take it that far.  So when did you realize that the nagging was definitely a problem?  Because I bet you at first there's a little nag that comes your way, but you're like,  eh, whatever.  Yeah, all right.  Maybe she could take it.  Maybe she just had a bad day where I could take it.  What?  I thought it was hormone swings from the pregnancy. 
[02:49:00]  She got pregnant early on.  I thought it was just that.  After she had the baby, she stayed a bit, so it wasn't that.  Yeesh.  You should be able to get out of this stuff without a lawyer getting involved, man.  Now she's a mom with her stupid socks pulled up over the stretchy pants.  You had me dead to death with that little story about getting raped, you know, a $60,000  a year, taking half of it.  You know, you got me worried to death now.  Thanks.  I appreciate that, guys.  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right, Keith.  Good luck to you there, huh?  Thank you.  Have a good one.  I don't know where this guy's going, but we'll see.  Bill in Boston, what's up? 
[02:49:30]  What's up, guys?  How about those socks?  How about the Pats?  You got to congratulate him on the Pats.  I already did the Pats score.  I got to do it again.  I got to do it again.  Pats beat the Rams 40 to 22.  Who cares?  Go ahead.  Ann, I don't know if you can, like, how much can you talk about your divorce?  Like, was there any agreements in the settlement or anything like that?  I'm just talking about general relationships, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Anthony speaks freely.  That's it.  Well, I wanted to ask you, like, out of all the lawyers in New York, why would she hire 
[02:50:00]  Dominic Barbara, who's associated with Howard?  Yeah, and then the company doesn't understand why we hate Howard and we should get along with  him.  Yeah, okay.  No shit.  I would guess, you know, I don't know why, but I would guess because it's, you know,  one of those great little tactics.  It just, it puts the fear of things being in the public eye on someone else's radio show.  It, you know, he's known for being a pretty good divorce lawyer, too.  Right.  All right.  There you go.  Well, that's that, then. 
[02:50:30]  There it is.  Huh?  There it is.  What?  There it is.  There it is.  Okay.  We got Tony Dan's outtakes.  Outtakes?  Outtakes.  You mean, uh, applause breaks?  No, these are outtakes.  Outtakes from?  From doing promos for a show.  How do we get these?  We don't want to tell anyone how we get these.  We are entrenched.  We're well connected in this city.  That's great.  We got, uh, outtakes of Tony Dan's are trying to do some promos.  Right, Steve?  We're going to take a break first. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  Don't, don't say where you got it from, because this guy could be a gold mine for us.  What is that hat you're wearing?  What's on the side of that one?  It's flames.  Something with a flame on it.  And a skull on one side.  Exactly.  Flames and skull.  That's why you were able to wear the shirt with nothing on it.  Exactly.  I had to compensate.  Yeah.  I had to compensate with the hat.  I like it.  You think about what you're going to wear every day.  Well, to the extent this.  Dude, because you fold up your, your sleeves perfectly.  Yeah.  Just like two and a half times on each side.  I get the most disgusted look from Norton right now.  It's just the hat.  Oh, okay. 
[02:51:30]  No, I can't say where we got it, but, um.  I can't even.  Yeah.  I can't even listen to you talk anymore, because of Norton.  Why?  Yes?  Go ahead.  Can't say where you have, where we got it?  What, what, what exactly is the audio?  Oh, the audio.  It's, uh, outtakes.  Are you playing it?  Pardon me.  Martini Steve.  There's a lot going back.  Oh, it is.  So, we got, we got this audio from what?  Uh, a very nice person. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  Cool.  You came in for that?  I was told to come into the studio.  I don't really know what the hell I was talking.  I can't hear you guys in the other room, by the way.  So, I am, I'm, I'm yelled at to get into the studio.  What are you working on today for the show?  Um, what I handed you, and then some more audio of a pre-interview from that show.  Is that good?  I don't know yet.  It's dumping into Pro Tools right now.  All right.  Are you letting your hair grow back, or are you going to keep it short?  I'm going to let it grow back.  It's cool, short.  Thank you, sir.  I like it.  Thank you.  Yeah, I like, uh, it's, it's growing in.  And it's growing in at the same rate as his sideburns. 
[02:52:30]  Exactly.  His, uh.  Uniformity.  Pork chop sideburns.  Dude, you were that kid in school, man.  You grow that crap in a day.  Yeah, I was, I had 12, I had sideburns.  He was a 5 o'clock shadow guy.  He's Lebanese.  We all had one of those guys in school growing up.  My buddy, uh, Joe Curry was, uh, foot, plank foot, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He was that guy.  He actually got thrown out of the school one day, uh, and he was going to the school.  They, they were convinced he wasn't a student.  And he was telling them, no, I go here.  And they just kept ushering him out the door, because he had a full beard.  I mean, like, ridiculous, full, grisly Adams beard. 
[02:53:00]  And what was he, like, 15 years old?  He was, uh, no, it was his senior year, so he was, you know, 17, 18.  The type of guy that gets served when he's, like, 16, right?  Oh, yeah.  He was buying beers for us.  You know, he was the great guy to have around, because he could go in and buy beers.  They wouldn't proof him.  All right.  Mark wants in.  Go ahead, Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just signed my divorce papers two weeks ago.  Congratulations.  Bro, you know what I'm saying?  I would bust my ass, take clients out after work.  I'd get home at 3 in the morning, have to be back in my office at 6.30, so enough time 
[02:53:30]  for a half-hour nap and a shower.  Right.  And he would bitch and bitch.  Meanwhile, all day, she was sitting at Americana Shopping Center, spending the money I fucking  made on a little Prada shoes.  There you go.  So, you know what?  They nag and they nag.  Yep.  And you know what?  I can understand why somebody wants to run their wife over.  You know, for that little minute where she's just glimmering in the headlights, for that  split second, where any rational-thinking human being would say, no, and you put it  in park and go, what am I thinking? 
[02:54:00]  But there's that one little moment.  Well, you want to tell them, put your head by the hood, see if you hear that noise.  Could you listen?  I hear a clicking.  Right, right.  What is that band that said it's over?  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Show's great.  Thanks, Mark.  The marriage was going well, but I was drinking consistently on the road.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Jim's smart, though.  He knows he can't hear it.  He's in the other state.  Oh, very good.  All right.  Mr. Smarty Pants.  One more.  We got to go to Phoenix.  Say hi to Mike. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, Mike, what's up?  By the way, as I'm putting income in the bank week after week, I was told I couldn't get  a cell phone.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do, Anthony.  I want a cell phone.  Just like you.  You don't need a cell phone.  Just like your pal Opie.  I think I was a bad influence on you.  You don't need a cell phone.  All it was was a cell phone.  I remember you guys got an argument.  You don't need a cell phone.  I want a cell phone.  What if there's an emergency?  Well, you know, you can get a car phone. 
[02:55:00]  Like a big unit that goes in the car, but no cell phone.  Son of a bitch.  And then you got to weigh.  You got to weigh it.  Do I be a man and get the cell phone and say, go fuck yourself?  Or do I not have to deal with an argument now because of this?  What was the problem with the cell phone?  There has to be a reason.  What?  There has to be some rational reason?  Wait a minute, Opie.  Have you been listening?  There has to be a reason for some of this stuff?  I thought there might have been a reason that was told to you.  A reason?  Yeah.  Like a legitimate argument, a legitimate other side, other view that would then be focused 
[02:55:30]  back to me that I would then.  People thought we were rock stars and you're having these arguments behind the scene over  our cell phone.  Wow.  The only rocking I was doing was in my own feces as I was trying to figure out how I would  get out of this.  Please.  There was nothing going on.  And you did quite well for yourself, my friend.  I was able to come...  You know something?  Like the sad clown, I was able to come in on a daily basis and make people laugh though 
[02:56:00]  I cried inside.  Oh, they laughed and they laughed and they laughed.  Though I cried inside.  Oh my God.  Hey Mike, what's going on?  Oh, not much, man.  Hey man, I know what you guys are talking about.  I walked in on my ex-wife fucking my best friend, man.  Let me tell you.  Ow.  And on top of that, she was nagging and nagging and nagging.  And then the bitch had the gold, tried to fucking take me for half my paycheck.  I'm like, no, sweetheart.  I don't think so.  Them's the rules. 
[02:56:30]  Are you still friends with the guy?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, he was my best friend, man.  Are you still friends with him?  Oh, I don't know.  No, no, no, no.  I scared the shit out of him right now.  I have so much as twitch in front of him and he's out the door fucking heading down the  block.  What position were they in when you found him?  Missionary, man.  Did he have a big God?  Yeah.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  You still see him?  Why does he twitch now?  Where do you still bump into this guy?  What was that?  Where do you still see him?  Why do I still see him?  I got two boys with her. 
[02:57:00]  What's that?  I got two kids with her, man.  Oh, he lives with her now?  What?  He lives with her now?  This guy doesn't understand.  Wow, now I understand why the wife had to move on.  She's like, look, just move to the left and I'll come.  What?  No, dude, what Norton is asking, okay, if it's your friend, you found him banging your  wife, but you still run into him, is that because he's now living with her?  Oh, yeah.  And raising your two kids. 
[02:57:30]  How does that make you feel?  I still want to tee off on his forehead.  How long was that relationship going on before you found out about it, sir?  It sucked, man.  I wanted out.  You know, you guys were talking about the cell phone.  Or any question you feel like asking is acceptable.  Well, that Falangong's got to, you know, we need to support us.  Do you think that it was going on for a long time before you actually walked in on them,  sir?  No, it was probably only going on for a long time.  How long have they been living together?  How long have they been living together now? 
[02:58:00]  What?  How long have they been living together?  About two years.  Do you still talk to him at all if you have to?  How do the kids feel about him?  How do the kids feel about him?  Does it bother you that he lives...  They were too young to even know about this shit, so...  No, no, but does it bother you that he lives with the kids, I'm saying?  Man, you're breaking up hardcore. 
[02:58:30]  What?  Does it bother you that he lives with the children?  That he what?  The children?  That he lives with them.  I think your mic's too loud.  I can't hear you, dude.  Oh.  Really?  All right.  I can hear you just fine, but...  All right, we're going to move on.  Thank you.  John the trucker.  We've got to take a break, but John, go ahead.  Is my mic on?  Should be.  I'm just going to make a suggestion.  Can you hear me, fella?  How do you keep the second wife from nagging? 
[02:59:00]  Holy shit, is this today's problem?  John, can you hear Norton?  Yeah.  John, if I ask you a question right now, you can hear me.  I can hear you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Then it was that guy's problem.  No problemo.  All right, go ahead, John.  I'm just going to tell you how to keep the second wife from nagging.  You shouldn't kill the first one.  I like it.  Yeah, a little warning.  He's not kidding.  Why would you even have a second wife?  I could not imagine getting married the second time.  Just don't happen.  Oh, I met her when I was in prison. 
[02:59:30]  You met your second wife while you were in prison?  Yeah.  For killing your first wife?  Right.  You really killed your first wife?  I shot her with that bitch right through the fucking head.  All right, hold on.  We're not taking a break any time soon.  Now, I...  Dude, he's a trucker.  You've got to believe him.  Now, what were these circumstances?  And how did you get out of jail?  I was 15 to life.  I got out in 15 years.  I thought this guy was just a little cute little joke. 
[03:00:00]  How do you keep your second wife from nagging you?  You killed the first one.  You killed the first one.  Ha, ha, ha.  Little joke.  Thank you.  And then, you're listening to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Dude, you've got to tell us what happened.  Give me the story.  What happened leading up to and after killing your wife?  Yeah, let's back up here.  What led up to it?  What did she do to deserve this?  Well, we were both doing acid.  We was all fucked up.  Oh, my God.  We're talking to Charlie Manson.  Kept nagging me.  Kept nagging me.  I come on board one day.  I was all fucked up on acid. 
[03:00:30]  She started in.  I just blowed her fucking head off.  She was ragging.  Do you remember...  Hey, John, do you remember what she was nagging you about?  Oh, she was nagging about my coming in late and shit.  Now, I got off work at four in the afternoon.  I want to get home until like 11, 12 o'clock at night.  What were you doing?  You never spend no time with me.  You never do this.  You never do that.  See, look at what it got her.  Bitch, you never spend time with me.  How old a guy are you, John?  Do what?  How old are you? 
[03:01:00]  Right now, I'm 49.  49.  Okay, so you decided to kill her.  So what did you do?  You grabbed your shotgun?  Come on.  No, I always carried the pistol on her.  I lived back in Kansas back there.  So you always had a pistol on you and you just leveled it at her and shot her in the head?  Shot her right between the fucking eyes.  Was she surprised?  A little bit.  Did she look? 
[03:01:30]  I don't know if she was so surprised or she just amazed I'd do it.  What size gun was it, sir?  22.  Oh, wow.  That gives them a little time to think about it.  Oh, Jesus.  Was she alive after you shot her?  No, 22 does better, really, than it's a head wound.  You think so?  It really changes around.  Kind of bounces around in the brain pan a little bit?  Yeah, it kind of scrambles it rather than blows the whole completely through it.  So then did she live through the initial blast?  No.  She was dead.  She dropped dead right there on the spot.  I sat down, spoke to the joint, called the cops, told them I killed her. 
[03:02:00]  They come out, pick my ass up.  Send somebody.  I think I killed Doyle.  Eating potatoes.  That's what that buddy of mine said.  He goes, man, that sounds like something out of that fucking sling blade.  Poor little feller.  All right, so then they arrested you and you were convicted?  I just killed Doyle.  And you only got 15 to life?  15 to life out of it.  And how many years did you serve? 
[03:02:30]  I'm sorry, you both talked at the same time.  Sorry.  How much time did you serve?  15 years.  15 years.  Sir, I have to ask you the question now.  You're out.  You're a trucker.  Was it worth it?  Yeah.  Because I didn't pay no fucking support.  It was worth it.  He spent 15 years in prison for killing his wife and he says it was worth it. 
[03:03:00]  How did you break that news to your second wife?  She knew about it.  I just told her to read this newspaper article, told her the dates, stuff.  She pulled it up and looked at it.  All right, I got to tell you what's going on in the studio.  Jim was not buying this story when we started, right?  Not at all.  I want to put this guy in hold.  I want to get his last name.  I want to see if we can find an article on this.  Oh, yeah.  Your name would pop up in the news, right?  It should.  It was a long time ago, but it should.  All right. 
[03:03:30]  You know what?  Can you hold on through the break?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  We got to see if this is real.  John the trucker killed his wife.  Wait, we could ask him one other thing.  Give me John for a second.  And then he did 15 years to life.  So, John, your second wife started writing you in prison?  Yeah.  She started writing me when I put my name in Easy Rider magazine.  You know, I had a mail call.  Right.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  We'll get the second part of your story next.  So, he had his name in Easy Rider.  Easy Rider.  And she started writing him in prison.  And then he gets out 15 years later and they get married.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Obviously, you'll stick around because we've got to get the second part of this story in  just a minute here.

[03:09:00]  na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  we gotta get Steve back in here  got an instant feedback Opie  you know we were talking about  getting ragged  and getting into arguments  with girlfriends  or wives  and I never knew what to do  should I stay in bed  or should I get up  and continue the argument  well Doughboy  from Whackbag says  you know just laying in bed  is the best thing to do 
[03:09:30]  famous last words  of Phil Hartman  probably what he said  yeah I'm just gonna lay in bed  Steve you got some anger issues  sometimes  Steve's in charge of the  production for the  Opie and Anthony show  I'm starting to notice a trend  and I gotta be honest  the next time I go out  and we go out  to do an appearance  or something  it would be really nice  to see some women there  good luck now  and good luck with all these  promos about girls  getting you know  punched  girls getting knocked  you know  run over by buses 
[03:10:00]  very misogynistic  girls having their  promos  their puhahs  being blown up  by firecrackers  how are we supposed  to get women  to listen to this show  are you blaming me  for all those  well  you just put the  poker chip one together  which actually is  really really funny  thank you  but then we play that  it's all about  like balance  and variety  so we play the  poker chip thing  going in a break  which is just brutal  but funny  and then we come back  to the show  with another girl  getting just run over  by a freaking bus  and most of these 
[03:10:30]  are coming from  your twisted mind  some of them  yeah  well  it's a good way  to get out aggression  without actually  punching somebody  or going  you know  attacking  what  no no  I'm just thinking  of what aggression  you might have  like you know  oh you know  well general aggression  that you can't take out  on you know  other you know  someone that you know  maybe lives in New Jersey  yeah exactly  are you unhappy  no  why would I  I'm always unhappy  anger of seeing a big steak  and having a stomach  the size of a walnut  yeah exactly  that'd make you angry  no no nothing like that  like sometimes you get frustrated 
[03:11:00]  like you build up frustration  through the day  and you want to take it out  on something  for the faithful listeners  of this program  just listen to the production pieces  they're all about  just kicking the shit  out of a woman  yeah  but who's been talking lately  I'm not even sure  who's in the studio  what  I don't know  oh  yeah  so why so angry  no okay  why so angry  why am I angry  I  wasn't sure how deep  all right  well thank you Steve  I wasn't sure how deep  into the sentence  I had to go  it could turn up 
[03:11:30]  at any point  in your appearance  well you know  in all fairness  I don't want to take credit  for all those  because there are some  very skilled production guys  why don't we soften up  on the female abuse  just a tad  yeah  firecracker in the vagina  there's a lot of  I'd love to lighten up  on the female abuse  mister I threw a  poker chip bin  at a girl  and it landed on her foot  well alright  you got me there  that is a good point  and by the way  who was saying  they want to get rid  of the poker chips  they're sitting on the console  Ben  Ben's thinking  we should get rid of them  they're not in the way 
[03:12:00]  they're right there  remember we were talking earlier  we don't know when  to make people leave the studio  like Pablo Francisco  on Friday  we were in pain  just like you guys  were listening to that  Pablo  I think for now on  that's going to be  the hint to get  the hell out of here  is that the signal  when Opie throws  poker chips at you  yeah why not  just keep them  right where they are  you might want  something a bit more  obvious  so that's kind of subtle  alright Steve  I just noticed a trend  and I'm sure the listeners  are especially  because I get email  from women like  look we really want  to listen to you guys 
[03:12:30]  but it's getting  a little out of hand  alright well that was  I don't know if  they have a leg  to stand on  but I just want  to bring that up  that's all  well I'll give credit  to the guys in D.C.  who did some  of the more brutal ones  but I will make  an effort to lighten up  how about a little  balance Ed Game  that's all we're saying  I just want to see  their heads on a stick  instant feedback  thank you  it's fucking time  most of the sweepers  are just about  people getting  beaten up gratuitously  Steve is one acid trip  away from a 15 year  vacation  god bless that man 
[03:13:00]  yeah well it started  with the overly gay  promos  yeah yeah  we had to put a stop  to that so then  it went from overly gay  to let's beat the crap  out of women  what did our old ones  used to sound like  at the other radio station  what did they sound like  were they  they were cute  and fun  light hearted at times  ok terrific  we had that guy  ok terrific  yeah  there were a few  weren't they more fun  there was the one  sometimes you get  intelligent talk  about stocks  other times you get  us talking about  chicks boobs  there was that one  that aired forever  see but it was 
[03:13:30]  but they were fun  fun ones  we were just talking  about chicks boobs  we weren't trying to  put them in a vice  and squeeze them  nah nah  what the hell  is going on here  Steve  all of a sudden  where yeah  and I blame you  because you're the guy  like the old guy  didn't have like  women getting the  shit kicked out of him  in all fairness  to the old guy  we got censored a lot  we used to brainstorm  and come up with  these really really  awful ones  that wasn't censorship  that was Jimmy  being polite to you  like you know what  I would love to do  the promo where we  take a hatchet  to a girl's skull  but you know 
[03:14:00]  the lawyers  are going to get  involved  and you know  so we're not  going to do that one  exactly  he prevented me  from doing a lot  of the chloroform ones  thank god he prevented  you from doing those  alright I'm just  expressing some  unhinged creativity  unhinged anger  Opie and Anthony  show  remember that one  right  yeah they were  like fun ones  now it's just  beating women's  brains out  with a baseball bat  we're all scared 
[03:14:30]  Opie and Anthony  we're all kind of  scared to confront  you over it  so this is kind of  like an intervention  going on here  ONA  the girls are in  basements  getting tortured  radio that  Martha Moxley  can't enjoy anymore  you know  they're getting  tortured  and they're getting  their poohahs  blown up  and they're  bouncing off  the front of buses  pull your bitches  teeth out with  pliers  it's the Opie and  Anthony show  shut your mouth 
[03:15:00]  it won't sound like  the girl getting  shut your mouth  that's the drop  from Rob Zombie's  movie  House of a Thousand  Corpses  I had nothing to do  with that sweeper  thank you very much  yeah but it all  filters through you  so you might want to  pile up all the ones  abusing women  that pile's going to be  about three feet high  and then a cute little  fun loving little  promo thing  that one's about  a quarter of an inch  don't use piles  use buckets  alright  one bucket has the  anti-woman  women being beaten up  content in it 
[03:15:30]  and the other bucket  has everything else  I have an announcement  to make  I love women  wow  Steve do you love  women  of course I do  in my own special way  yeah  as he hands us  the latest gag  porno  I mean you got  problems  it's all animal  porn and vicious  face punching  I don't mind  the BJ porno  that's making him  choke and puke  I don't mind a good  throat yogurt  porno every once in a while  I like this one  he writes cunt  on their forehead  with lipstick  right 
[03:16:00]  why do you make  it sound so gay  they're gagging  and smacking  the girl's  eye face  it's like  alright let's  as we move forward  let's  what happened  oh there's  whispering going on  they might be  trying to enhance  the bit  what is the boy  with frosted hair  whispering about  he has nothing  old frosty top  he sure is a looker  alright we're waiting  for that trucker  to call back  about killing his wife  where is he  he's not going to  call back  he hung up  because we  we kind of  screwed up  I talked to  Steve  if you want  to know the  truth  I should have  you hung up  they do 
[03:16:30]  they hang up  that's ok  the show moves on  yeah he'll probably  call back  no he won't  I guarantee you  the whole thing  was just a big  phony fake  no that wasn't  phony  I don't know  I'm working on it  we'll see  that wasn't phony  oh we're gonna say  yeah  oh you know  his last name  yeah I have  everything  oh right on  know what's funny  it's not funny  actually  we should bring  him in here  Master Po  wants to kill  this guy  what guy  the guy that  killed his wife  of 15 years  why  well let's get  Master Po  in here really  fast to see 
[03:17:00]  what this is  all about  Master Po  has a great  chin  Master Po  is our  assigned  assassin  he's like  a black belt  and he's  like very  scary  Sensei  here he is  yes sensei  yes sensei  it has to be  an easy way  for music  hold on  hold on  your intro music  is playing  yeah  you know  can I use  the crane  sensei  there's gotta be  a new rule  when these people  come in the studio  they gotta put  headphones on  cause he has  no idea  he has no idea  his music  blasting  and he's  trying to 
[03:17:30]  explain himself  you have  theme music  now sensei  yeah  listen to  your theme  music  he's laughing  yes Kanye  son  you have  the faggiest  theme song  ever  oh you're  gonna tell him  that to his face  well I just  figured I'd tell him  thank you Anthony  but it fits  you know  it's the whole  sensei  what the faggy part  no not the  faggy part  stop  are you calling  him a fag  Jesus  I wouldn't  in my wildest  hallucination 
[03:18:00]  I would never  even  are you gonna  take that  no sensei  no he's  bowing  he's okay  oh you got  his back  he's got  my back  you got  his back  I don't have  his back  I was just  handing him  that in case  he might  need it  how was he  able to  bring that  in  was that  a 9mm  what is  going on  ixnay  wow  cool  wow sensei  no that's  good music  it's not  faggy  it shows  the training  that is  involved 
[03:18:30]  wait why  was he  allowed to  bring that  in today  I know  he's a  friend of  ours  but  it's like  show and  tell  there's  nothing  you're  even  I don't  know  what  you're  talking  about  oh my  god  that just  made me  go  I don't  even know  what you're  talking about  I don't like  the theme music  you picked  from Astro Poe  why don't you  like that  I don't think  it's suiting  I think  it's too  soft  did you  ever see  the karate  kid  boy  did I  there's  some  ass  kicking  going on  that hot  scene  where he's  laying  on the  table  and Miyagi  rubs  his hands  together  I will  fix your 
[03:19:00]  arm  and your  leg  Daniel-san  happy ending  there's a little  happy ending  on the table  in the back  room  and then he  could come  out  and even  though  mean sensei  was telling  the kid  to beat  up  a young  what's  Daniel-san  Daniel-san  rose above  it all  whack on  whack off  right  show me  happy ending  show me  the whack  on  show me  the whack  off  so uh  this guy  that killed  his first  wife  down  up 
[03:19:30]  down  faster  damn  your  son  make  Miyagi  explode  so that  guy  yes  he was  very pissed  off about  that guy  that killed  his first  wife  wow  why  well  first of  all  I don't  think  that  any  man  should  hurt  a  woman  oh  I don't  think  that  a man  should  raise  their  hands  to a  woman  unless  the woman  is trying  to kill  him  or unless  the woman  takes half  of everything  you've  worked for  you could  always gain  that once  again 
[03:20:00]  how about  if she's  talking  during the  game  you know  it seems  silly with our  promos that  we play  but you would  not get an  argument out  of anybody  in this  room  of course  we are  probably  the biggest  pussies  when it  comes to  women  they could  crap  all over  us  yes  they can  I didn't  mean it  literally  except in  jimza  they have  I've never  done anything  like that  never even  raised a  hand  I don't  believe in  that  defensive  put your 
[03:20:30]  arms up  and go  stop  have you  done that  no  you don't  pick your  hands up  at all  nothing  just let  them hit  you  well you  can  take it  the best  thing you  can do  is take  your hands  cut them  place them  in front  of you  and walk  away  yeah  that's the  best thing  that you  can do  because as  soon as you  raise your  hands it  looks like  you're aggressively  going at  them  and then  they'll say  and then  someone  ten feet  away will  say  I saw  him with  the raised  hands  exactly  instead of  hey I was  protecting my 
[03:21:00]  nutsack  and that was  it  hands in  front of  me  words to  live by  Lloyd  words to  live by  words to  live by  alright thanks  master  thank you  master  thank you  and there  he goes  there he  goes  there you  go  there he  goes  he bows  when he  leaves  kneel in  front of  sensei  kneel in  front of  sensei  take a  knee  remember the  mean sensei  in karate  kid  sure do  he looked  at that  gook  mr.  Miyagi  and wanted  to just  you know  because he  was in  the  knob 
[03:21:30]  wanted to  slit his  throat  alright we  got the  tony danzo  audio  I have a  question  I wanted  to discuss  briefly  remember in  part three  was it  part three  when the  mean sensei  pretended to  be a nice  sensei  yes  the mean  sensei  pretended to  be nice  sensei  and he was  helping  La Russa  and he was  making him  punch the  wood  boy that was  really intense  wasn't it  yeah  you really saw  the third  version of  who didn't  who didn't  see them  all  you didn't  see every  karate kid  part two  was actually  good  was it  yeah it  was good  I didn't  see it

[03:46:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, that's right, Anthony.  We got some hot tea news today.  It's disguised as a golf prostitution story.  But if you read into it, it includes hot tea news.  Hot tea news.  Three sentence for golf with prostitutes.  Two golf course managers, two golf course managers, two golf course managers and a tournament organizer were sentenced to house arrest for hosting two competitions featuring prostitutes and strippers stationed along the putting greens, Anthony. 
[03:47:30]  The judge chided, the judge, the judge chided the three for the judges and girl, the judge chided the three for their immoral and illegal actions at the so-called girly tournaments in squirtly.  In 2002, check this out.  More than a dozen prostitutes and strippers, including a 16-year-old girl,  set up tents and advertised their services on board, the officials said.  About 160 golfers paid $200 apiece to play,  though some showed up without their clubs. 
[03:48:00]  It's in the hole!  It's in the hole!  They showed up without their clubs, Anthony, for a golf tournament.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid!  Yeah!  Hey, I'm all right!  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  I think this place is restricted, Wang, so don't tell me you're Jewish. 
[03:48:30]  Hey, I should have stayed home and played with myself.  Yeah, you would have gotten arrested there.  Should I continue?  Yes.  Sure.  I saw your finger on the button over there, Anthony.  Sheriff's deputies wearing camouflage raided the second tournament,  detaining 90 golfers and 17 strippers and alleged prostitutes,  along with golf course workers.  90 golfers?  90 golfers. 
[03:49:00]  They were in camouflage like Bill Murray.  They were running around, arresting these old men that just wanted a little action instead  of going home to their nagging wife.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Bark like a dog.  I will teach you the meaning of the word of respect.  They arrested these 90 golfers.  90!  90 golfers and 17 strippers and alleged prostitutes.  Event organizer Sandy, 39, was accused of providing the prostitutes.  In a deal with prosecutors, she pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to corrupt public morale 
[03:49:30]  and testified against Hidden Valley Golf Club general manager.  Morals, sorry.  Jason Wood, 38, and his former assistant.  Wood.  You said Wood.  Public morale.  I know.  Corrupt public morale.  That is a morale booster, though.  I'm sorry.  The pair pleaded guilty in July to the same charge.  All three were sentenced to 125 days of house arrest. 
[03:50:00]  So, they got off pretty easy.  Two golfers have been convicted of engaging in prostitution.  Engaging in prostitution right on the golf course?  So, would you shoot a hole?  Like they said, they had them set up by the greens?  Yeah.  So, you play out a hole, you get done, and you catch a blowjob, and then go to the next one?  That would be a hell of a way to play golf.  I don't know how long it would take, though.  You know how pissed off you get when the guys aren't moving along?  Come on, move it along!  At least they would have an excuse, you know?  They certainly would.  Two golfers convicted of engaging in prostitution, and the mother of the 16-year-old prostitute 
[03:50:30]  is charged with child endangerment and prostitution.  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  How would you like to borrow my lawn?  Huh?  The mother brought her daughter there for that?  I guess so.  We're tanks for nothing!  Yeah.  Yeah, tanks for nothing.  The mother brought the daughter.  Where is this fine establishment?  California.  Wow.  Somewhere in California.  But wow, yeah.  Never happens at the golf outings.  The golf outings I go to.  Not at all.  Somebody's sitting at a hole saying, eh, you want to put in some money? 
[03:51:00]  You want to buy a chance at some old lady that's been smoking for 40 years?  If you give me $20 and you get closest to pin, you could win the Buick.  But what about the blowjob?  I want a BJ.  I want...  Yeah, that's something.  All right.  Maybe next year's tournament, Opie.  All right.  Are we ready...  Are we...  Are...  Are we... 
[03:51:30]  Are we ready to play...  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah, I see.  It was a very educational program.  Chris, who came from his mom's box, wants in.  Yes, Chris?  I learned today that Opie says butt sex is just for the kids.  There you go.  Leave it to the young to do the butt sex thing.  It's for the kids.  That's my opinion.  That's all.  Let's say hi to Rob in Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  What's up, Chris?  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  I learned today that when it comes to anal sex, it's okay to get the uniform dirty once  in a while. 
[03:52:00]  There you go.  Good boy.  And who's Chris?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Mind your own beeswax.  Jason, the trucker.  What did you learn, Jason?  Yeah, I learned today that Anthony's mother-in-law is just like his ex.  The only cheese is a box of wine, and they stay up until early in the morning and argue  about three rights to make a left.  I'm going to hang up and go listen to myself for four hours.  That was awful.  That call stunk until the end.  Right at the end.  Right at the end, he pulled it out.  He pulled it out.  But they said it right on the screen. 
[03:52:30]  An awful, what did we learn?  But then he pulls it out with, I'm going to hang up and listen.  I'm going to listen to myself in four hours.  Very funny.  Brandon from Ohio.  What's up?  Yo, yo, yo, boys.  Over there, you a pimp, but listen to this.  I don't understand why you let Canadians on your radio show.  There are a bunch of silly scumbags and a faggot up there, and I think Tony Danza's a  faggot, and he's Canadian, too.  That's what I learned.  Easy, fella.  You see the Canadian immigration website got pounded by a bunch of Americans after the  election? 
[03:53:00]  A bunch of people are checking out Canada.  A bunch of Democrats, I thought Jimmy would like that.  Bye!  Left-wing assholes, bye!  Good riddance.  They're never going anywhere.  Canada's even more left-wing than anyone in the U.S. is.  Yeah.  Know who's happy that Bush was re-elected?  Michael Moore.  Yep.  Now you would think, why?  No way.  Michael Moore is so happy.  He hates George Bush because he could line his pockets with more cash now.  It gives him four more years.  Four more years of more documentaries.  Bash.  Right.  More documentaries.  He's never done one yet. 
[03:53:30]  They're all films.  They're docudramas.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what they're called now.  Loosely based on certain facts.  Yeah, they're movies.  Don't be fooled.  He is very happy that Bush was re-elected.  Today I learned that...  He couldn't be happier.  Steve C. is the radio equivalent of Michael Skakel.  Did learn that.  I learned little Jimmy likes turd sandwiches.  And I learned Keith the Cop has a young lad in his basement tied up with NEWT shirts  and his mouth taped shut with a WOW sticker. 
[03:54:00]  North Carolina checking in.  It's Mutt Bone.  I learned today good old Eddie has come out of retirement and he went back on the road.  That's one for the old listeners.  I hope we get the second half of that story tomorrow from the trucker who killed his wife,  did 15 years, and now is remarried.  See, he would have just been married for 15 years.  Another kind of hell.  And are we going to find the Chinese protesters again today?  We've got to take that bit to the next level.  Find out what Falun Gong is all about.  Yeah, I think we need to send Sex Bagel back on the street and get down to business with  these people.  He was a little too polite with the first version of that bit. 
[03:54:30]  Al Mack checking in.  I learned today, SNL answers their phones.  Falun Gong.  Chris from Boston.  I learned today, hey boys, the Philadelphia Eagles lost, the Cleveland Browns lost,  the New York Jets lost, and the Los Angeles Rams lost.  Los Angeles Rams.  I know, and 50-year-old women don't need tampons.  Mormon from D.C.  I learned that all of life's problems can be solved by stepping on the gas.  Just hit the gas pedal.  We can take a couple more phone calls here. 
[03:55:00]  Tony, what's going on?  Not much.  Okay.  I learned today that Anthony has a MILF.  Huh?  And has a MILF?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  He's saying, your mom is a MILF.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I had one.  Did we do that on today's show?  Yeah, we talked about how hot Ant's mom was.  I met her once.  She's phenomenal.  Wow.  Ant's mom is really, I mean, she is.  I was very, very surprised.  You could dish out a compliment and not have to go like that. 
[03:55:30]  Let me tell you something, man.  Hey.  What?  You could, you know, compliment.  At Dawn's party this summer, she came out of that, I mean, she, with those pants.  I mean, she.  Dude, dude.  A compliment is nice.  That's what I'm saying.  Going as far as you're going is a little too far.  What?  It's.  She had that nice, like, the, you know.  You want Sal to call?  No, I don't.  You want a phone call from Sal?  No, because they're not fun.  I think he's proud.  Of course, we're all very proud of my mommy.  That his wife is a hot piece of, you know what? 
[03:56:00]  Hey, no, no, no.  I mean, she's a piece of is not a compliment.  But she wears the heels and she walks around giving out a compliment.  I mean, she is like, I'm telling you, man, for her age.  That's a nice compliment.  Don't go any further.  You'll get the call from Sal.  I mean, when she wears the low cut number, I mean.  Hey, hey, hey.  What?  Hey.  Easy now, Chief.  Now you're getting a little.  I couldn't help it.  We were doing shots together.  She was all over the line a little bit.  A little.  There was a little flirting going on. 
[03:56:30]  I mean, she was.  A little flirting going on.  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  Daddy.  I'm going to call Obi Daddy.  You're going to get the call from Sal.  It's not going to be fun.  Yeah, we get scared when Sal calls.  You're right.  You saw some of the people that attend those parties.  Yeah.  I don't know what the hell they do for a living.  I go to a party with Anthony's family once a year, and it's like the cast of The Sopranos  in the backyard under a big tent, I swear to you.  One guy's walking the perimeter.  He goes, what is that guy doing? 
[03:57:00]  No, I said that.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  There was a guy walking the perimeter.  I'm like, look, he's walking the perimeter.  Like, there's the Godfather.  So I'm laughing, and no one's laughing at me.  They're all looking at me like, Ixnay on the walking guy.  Walking around the house.  Smashed the FBI camera in the driveway.  Like, throws money at him after that.  I felt like a pay for it.  I felt like such a dick, though, because I had to point it out.  Like, look, he's walking the perimeter.  Oh, that was a little accident.  No one was hurt.  Yeah.  What are you, dance judge?  Do your job. 
[03:57:30]  All right.  Do we have time for one more?  Anthony, what's going on?  Not too much open.  Oh, no.  The Anthony on the phone.  Jesus.  Anthony.  Yeah.  You hear the music?  Come on.  We're getting all nervous here.  Let's go.  All right.  And Jim Norton adds as much value to the show as the truckers do.  Oh, Jim, you're going to leave with that comment?  Yep.  Why?  Let him hurt my feelings if he wants to.  He's trying.  I mean, I...  Whatever.  What?  What? 
[03:58:00]  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture?  The OPNM show.  Can I help you?  Yes.  I'm calling about the job.  Hi, yes.  Are you currently working downtown?  Yes.  Well, actually, I was cutting hair uptown, and now I want to get there, because I see what  you say about the Wall Street thing there.  Right.  I could probably bring in a lot of clientele.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'll be interviewing all next week. 
[03:58:30]  Okay, great.  Listen, what about styles?  What kind of styles are you looking for?  We do everything.  Right.  All right, look.  I'm pretty far out there.  I've done some wacky shit.  I used to shoot people's heads up with Novocaine and carved roofs in their head.  I mean, if that's too far-fetched, you've got to let me know.  Well, first of all, we work on Wall Street, so the people here aren't going to be that wild.  Right, right.  I did a lot of work in the village, man.  I'm a fucking...  I'm crazy.  I'm a nut job.  One time I gave this guy a haircut. 
[03:59:00]  He didn't like it.  He kicked my fucking ass all over.  If you want to come in one day next week, I'll be glad to see you.  Right, right.  As long as my appearance wouldn't bother you.  I'm carved from head to toe.  I'm a lunatic.  But I'll come in, and we'll shoot the shit, and you can see some of my work.  No problem.  Do you want us to find him one day next week?  Whatever's fine.  Listen, I'll bring my children down.  I carved the shit out of their heads, too.  But it looks good.  It looks good.  You never heard of that before? 
[03:59:30]  Excuse me?  Did you ever hear of that procedure?  Yes.  Is that something, or what?  I don't think anyone down here would want that done, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.  All right, great.  Well, I'll come down, and you can show me your shit, and maybe kick me around the office a  little, and we'll throw ideas back and forth, okay?  Very.  You want my address?  Yes, please.  All right.  We're at the trade center.  Oh, holy shit.  All right.  Okay, I'll see you then.  I'll see you, what, Wednesday? 
[04:00:00]  Next week?  Wednesday is fine.  Okay.  I'm so happy.  Bye-bye now.  Okay.  See you then.  Bye-bye.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XM Radio.  When the weather turns cold, diesel engines can be a real pain to start.  Now, here's some tips to ensure your diesel starts every time when you crank that key,  and it's cold outside.  Use anti-fuel gel and stabilizer, because when it gets cold, diesel fuel gels up and  stops flowing.  In extreme cold, use a battery blanket to keep the battery warm. 
[04:00:30]  Install a block heater to keep the oil warm.  Cold oil makes for hard cranking.  Try to shield the front grill from wind, because cold wind freezes the engine block,  making for hard starting.  And finally, make sure the glow plugs are in good working order.  Worn glow plugs will not pre-ignite fuel, and thus hard starting occurs.  Following these tips should ensure your diesel starts on the coldest of mornings.  Got a question?
