<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in characteristically vulgar self-deprecating banter, insulting themselves with offensive terms and discussing their radio careers, dismissing David Lee Roth's potential in the medium.  They contrasted their own approach to broadcasting, emphasizing their work ethic and the demanding nature of daily radio. Anthony recounted a near-miss due to a snowstorm.  Patrice O'Neal was a prominent in-studio guest, with both hosts referencing separate pre-show conversations with him. The hosts discussed the fleeting nature of radio success, likening it to stand-up comedy, and reminisced about their early career, including the creation of their demo tape.  Doug Stanhope called in from Bisbee, Arizona, while intoxicated.  He recounted his life in Arizona, past addiction struggles, and his negative experience filming for Girls Gone Wild with Joe Francis.  His conversation touched upon his age, views on women, and his controversial "baiting" project targeting online pedophiles, raising concerns about potential defamation lawsuits.

The show featured numerous listener calls.  One caller claimed to have played Hooch in *Turner & Hooch*, another claimed to be an extra in *The Exterminator*. A female caller, JoAngela, attempted to participate in a sexually suggestive "tissue time" segment but was hampered by connection issues. The hosts discussed news stories – an underwater Santa Claus and upside-down Christmas trees – interspersed with their usual vulgar commentary. Anthony detailed a traffic stop where he used a "Keith card" to avoid a speeding ticket.

Later, Anthony recounted another traffic stop with an NYPD officer, followed by a discussion of a violent home invasion in Great Neck, Long Island. This sparked conversation about home security, leading to racially offensive jokes about Black and Puerto Rican people. They discussed a home invasion video game and Anthony’s extensive home security measures.  A significant portion focused on a "black men's magazine," its content (including jokes about mothers), and the hosts' observations on racial and cultural differences in humor.  Callers shared anecdotes related to police interactions and racial humor.  The show teased Disturbed's upcoming appearance and a news story about suspicious activity involving Santa's helpers.

A segment centered on a music CD featuring a rapper known as "Gangsta Fag," whose explicit lyrics detailed graphic sexual encounters and violent acts.  The hosts played several songs, reacting with a mixture of shock, amusement, and disbelief. Numerous listeners called in, expressing various reactions.  The rapper's persona and motivations were debated, and Joe Rogan was mentioned as the source of the CD.

A rambling discussion about the upcoming King Kong movie dominated a segment, filled with vulgar and sexually explicit jokes, including homophobic slurs and offensive remarks about Andrew Dice Clay and Tukey Williams.  Opie expressed his dislike for the film's emotional portrayal of Kong, contrasting it with his preference for a more violent monster. A caller, Big Kev, described the film as emotionally powerful, even causing some viewers to cry.  The hosts also promoted appearances at J&R Music World and a listener gathering for their "Million Pests March."  A final discussion about movies that made them emotional included *Ghost*, *Titanic*, *Saving Private Ryan*, *Band of Brothers*, and *The Champ*, punctuated by sexually explicit jokes.


The final segment revisited the theme of emotionally affecting movies,  including *Downfall*, *Rudy*, *Field of Dreams*, *Brian's Song*, and *Gladiator*.  They discussed scenes from *Forrest Gump*, *The Sixth Sense*, and *The Notebook*.  A news report about a five-year-old girl with a condition causing her to feel no pain was discussed, detailing her self-inflicted injuries.  Listeners offered often insensitive remarks, and Dr. Than, an in-studio guest, provided medical information.  The show concluded with more listener calls and vulgar humor.

[00:02:30]  The End 
[00:03:00]  Where do they turn when they're in despair? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, they're going to run!  It's showtime, folks!  It feels good.  It's cool.  We're brilliant broadcasters.  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  I'm ecstatic.  Very respectful.  Very nice.  There is some shenanigans going on.  It just feels right.  They're like two puggles.  We want perfect questions.  We want some laughs.  Feet me.  Some thoughts being provoked and thrown back and forth.  I don't like flaky.  I don't like flaky.  I like geeky.  I want to hug a cute dog.  What a fake was that? 
[00:04:00]  The name of this radio show should be The Happy Idiot and The Sullen Douche.  Two total dorks.  Am I listening to a radio show?  Two DJs and a tranny lover.  That's what this program's about, mister.  Only creeps listen to this program.  Let's go, boys.  What's happening, man?  On your fucking radio show!  Anyone around here ever smell my ass?  It's lovely.  Come on.  We're going to tell you how to get chicks.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm a horribly boring person.  We just kind of laugh at him. 
[00:04:30]  He's getting better, but we've got to break him in still.  He's a candidate for killing his wife when he gets married.  I love E-Rock and with a console at us.  Snapple and Mayo, your dumps must be lovely.  And featuring...  Arcane Bang!  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on the show.  Ramone, Ramone, Ramone!  Eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Can I say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick?  I got a few ideas.  I can get it fired. 
[00:05:00]  Please use them.  Please use them.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Poo-ah!  Poo-ah!  Yes!  Hello, exactly!  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole!  Will you just mind your peas in the juice, buster? 
[00:05:30]  And remember who you're dealing with.  Scott, why don't you put so many jerks in the world at the same time?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good morning and welcome to the ONA program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  The number one satellite radio company in the world.  Yes. 
[00:06:00]  It's not even close.  Not even.  Whose water is this?  Ew.  I was ready to swig a bottle of water that's been sitting here all weekend long.  Why don't people clean up?  Damn it.  Get rid of that right away.  Clean that up.  Patrice O'Neill helping us out once again today.  Thank you, Patrice.  Love having Patrice here.  Good morning, man.  Ahead of time.  I just love having Patrice here.  I read the message boards. 
[00:06:30]  You're a hit, my friend.  You're a hit.  I appreciate it.  You're a scream.  You're going to be big.  You're going to be a star.  I'm over here with tears in my eyes looking at this Kong thing.  I can't go see it.  Yeah, we were talking before the show started this morning about, what was that, a minute ago?  I think we were having separate conversations with Patrice O'Neill because I was having my own conversation with Patrice.  Were you?  And I was ready to bring up my conversation with Patrice.  And you beat me to it with your conversation with Patrice.  I read a little and then I talk to Patrice.  I read a little more. 
[00:07:00]  We're getting around, Patrice.  Jesus.  I thought I was bonding with you this morning and I find out that Anthony was bonding with you.  What was your conversation?  We were just talking about radio and how David Lee Roth's going to be a complete failure.  Oh.  I was just giving him some of the inside doings of what this is all about.  He's starting to get it, actually.  I go, Patrice, how much great radio did we do last week on XM?  He goes, man, yeah, we had a killer week.  There was so much going on with Twinkles or whatever the hell that guy's named, Twitchels. 
[00:07:30]  A lot of fun.  And Big A.  People were talking about it.  Yeah.  And there was just tons and tons of material that we gave everybody.  And I looked at Patrice and I go, you know what?  It just doesn't matter today.  We have to start all over.  Mm-hmm.  This is like stand-up comedy.  It's like, remember I was funny last week?  Yeah, remember that?  No, we don't.  Nope.  You better be funny again.  What have you done for me lately?  You've got to entertain them.  They're like animals.  They turn on you.  I want to be able to film a sitcom, man, 13, 16 episodes.  Then you sit back and just hang out and watch it on TV. 
[00:08:00]  And people will see you in public and go, hey, you're great on TV.  But you're not really great on TV because you haven't done anything on TV in a very long time.  You just sit back and reap the benefits.  You reap the benefits.  And then you know what they're all about.  You know how good each episode is.  So you could go, oh, wait until next week.  Right.  We can't say wait until tomorrow.  We don't know.  No.  Could stink.  No.  I mean, no one gives a shit that we had a great week of radio last week.  They don't care.  That's last week.  If we suck today, they're going to tell us how much we suck.  Then it's just you stink. 
[00:08:30]  And that's what I told Patrice.  I go, David Lee Roth is going to be a complete failure doing this free FM here in New York  and wherever else they're going to syndicate him because he just doesn't have the radio mind.  And it amazes me these radio executives don't see that.  They just assume, well, David Lee Roth could talk a little bit and he's a celebrity.  Let's throw him on the radio.  It should work.  But won't they get a radio guy?  It's like the thing.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like there's no radio guys left because all those guys, you know, left the business  years ago because they were fed up.  Here's what I heard from Infinity Executives, certain Infinity Executives. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you didn't hear the demo tape.  He showed a lot of promise and a lot of what we were looking for.  That's great.  That's what Infinity said.  Dude, when we got a job.  David Lee Roth demo tape.  When we got a job, I was working solo and then Ant and I met and the rest is history.  Anthony and I had to get a demo tape together to sell ourselves out there, right?  So what do you do?  I took three weeks of our shows, put it together, edited it in such a way that it made it sound 
[00:09:30]  like it was one show and sent it out.  The golden show.  The golden show.  And everyone started calling me going, wow, you guys, this is one radio show?  One bit from three weeks.  One bit a day from three weeks.  Oh, yeah.  But how it was put together, you couldn't tell the difference.  So these people are questioning me going, this is one show that you guys did?  And I'm like, oh, yeah, we had a slow day that night.  You know, just being so casual about it.  And then the next thing you know, we're getting hired like crazy. 
[00:10:00]  And the fact is, it was like a best of tape from like a month of shows or whatever it  was.  Told you when this dude, when you was late coming in for the snowstorm and shit, I'm sitting  there like, they're like, well, shit, Anthony's stuck in there and he ain't moving.  I'm like trying to keep a cool brown and shit.  And I'm like, oh, Lordy.  So it's like, it's like, and Opie's like, hey, man, you know, I'm sitting just drinking  the water, looking at him, not even looking up at the pavement.  I'm like, if this nigga Anthony don't show up, you better stop playing. 
[00:10:30]  You better play your old demo tape.  No, we hit Patrice O'Neill and it was going to be a wrap.  I knew his, I knew his cell phone was charged and ready to go.  That's why I didn't have any flop sweat.  I knew I could get a hold of my, my pal Anthony.  People seem to have enjoyed that little segment of me driving in and they want like to record  me every morning driving in, but it would, it's dull.  That was exceptional.  Yeah.  Every morning my drive in is fine. 
[00:11:00]  I get on, boom, I get in, everything's done.  And it's just that rare occasion where, uh, that was the first time that happened in over  a year.  Right.  Ever since we've been on the air.  Yeah.  It's the first time that happened.  So just wrapping up with, uh, Patrice and I'm like, David Lee Roth, he doesn't have enough  info in his head to do a radio show Monday through Friday.  He's going to run out of, he's going to run out of, he's going to run out of shit though  within a month.  And then what?  And then what?  Running out of shit is different than info.  It's like, he needs to know how to make a radio, like, you need to just know how to do  it.  You know what I mean?  It's just like funny, all funny guys can't do standup comedy because it's like a 
[00:11:30]  skill thing that you have to learn.  You know what I mean?  So, I mean, you can't, you got to give David Lee Roth at least five years before you judge  him.  I, uh.  Yeah, right.  In the radio world, they'll barely give him a year, maybe nine months.  Before, uh, me and Opie went up to Boston and, and did a radio up there, uh, the station  on Long Island was trying to pull some shenanigans with the deal, trying a little spite against  Opie and stuff.  And, and, uh, they knew that we had the deal up there in Boston, but they came to me behind 
[00:12:00]  Opie's back and said, look, we want you to take over the shift that Opie had.  This is just bullshit that happens in radio.  And, uh, I knew I was going up to Boston to do radio with Opie.  But also in my head is, do you think I could now, because I, I, me and Opie work out on  the air and I enjoy doing radio and, uh, you find me funny that I could just solo it.  Just do it.  That like after a few, now, now, all right, just do what you do. 
[00:12:30]  And like, it had nothing to do with the chemistry between me and Opie.  Opie's talents as a guy that is a seasoned, you know, radio veteran at the time.  Right, right.  Uh, even though he hadn't been in it for, for, you know, 20 years at that point, you'd  been doing it enough years where you knew the formula of radio.  Right.  There's a format.  There's a thing.  There's a thing you do.  Right.  There's a thing that I have no clue.  That I don't do.  That's not my gig.  I don't do that.  I comment on shit.  Comment. 
[00:13:00]  I'll make some funny remarks.  I know radio.  He knows radio.  There's nothing better than to want to just dump Opie right out of his fucking, all right,  just, hey, hey, we don't need you, Opie, get the fuck out.  But I'm watching this shit and it's like, you know, you going off, I'm yapping and shit.  And then he's like, all right, we got all these, like, he got all the CDs, all the paywallers.  Yeah.  Like, I'd just be, you know, hey, you know, Brad adopts Angelina's children.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  And blah, blah, blah.  You know that?  That's crazy.  Callers?  What do you think?  What do you think about that?  It's like taking a boat.  Nigga, we ain't calling nobody yet. 
[00:13:30]  It's taking a boat and saying, I got a motor.  I don't need this fucking rudder.  I'll just throw that thing overboard and we'll be fine.  And then you just putter around hitting reefs.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Yeah, you just, you want to just go, ah, you want to always let, you don't want to let anybody feel like you can't go without them.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So this might sound like, oh, kissing Opie's ass.  But if you, like, sitting here, you go, all right, good, all I need to do is, and sometimes I don't even need to say shit. 
[00:14:00]  But it's just like, okay, well, maybe it's time to say something.  And it's just, then it's like, he's, all right, listen, we got plenty of stuff here.  And every time he says that, I go, what the, what are you talking about, plenty of stuff?  I'm running out of stuff to say.  No, we got plenty of stuff here.  And then the subject changes and we're off.  We got Tyra Banks.  And then he, remember, Tyra Banks never got on.  He was saying two things he was saying for a week.  Tyra Banks and a gay, the gay rapper. 
[00:14:30]  The gay rapper.  I got it right here.  And it's still there.  It's still there, man.  We got it right here.  It's still there.  Tyra Banks is ready to go, bro.  That's the magic, Patrice.  And all the employees, all interns, all the producers all come to Opie.  Anthony reads until 659 and a half.  I'm a reading motherfucker.  And Opie comes in here and is like, hey, what do you think he's listening to remixes of him last week?  And, you know, what about this and that?  And it's like, you know what?  No, I was listening to all the Dickie Goodman remixes. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, awful.  And we've decided to bail on that bit.  Godspeed, Dickie Goodman.  Rest in peace.  So long.  You're gone.  You had a couple more minutes on this show, but it's over, Johnny.  And then someone put our Howard rant to, like, Doors music, and it's just stinks.  So we decided to pass on that as well.  Now, the David Lee Roth thing, to bring it all back around, he was a good guest when he'd be on Howard's show.  It was entertaining.  The guy's high energy.  He'd have stories.  He's a nice guy.  And I guess he's a nice enough guy. 
[00:15:30]  He's a nice guy, man.  He's not one of those rockers where you go, like, if you ask him a question, like, we was sitting at the village one day.  He was like, David, what was better pussy?  Just a gigolo pussy or everybody jump?  He's like, no, man.  Everybody jump pussy because the girls don't expect nothing out of you.  It was like he knew exactly what.  He wasn't like one of those guys, like, mm-mm.  He was a cool dude, but, you know, he's a nice guy.  See, I have to preface that the dude is a nice guy, but we talk about Howard.  He's going to run out of shit to talk about. 
[00:16:00]  Being a good guest on a show and doing some entertaining radio as a guest, and then it's your show.  Right.  That's rough.  He needs bits, and he doesn't have bits.  Anyway.  Have fun.  Godspeed.  Did they see how Obie was running the show there?  Anyway, he was running the show.  Anyway.  Boom.  Anyway.  That's a little Tiller move.  Hey, Doug, is this really you?  Yeah, yeah, it's me.  Doug Stanhope, everyone.  There he is.  Doug, what's up, man?  What time is it? 
[00:16:30]  Are you in L.A.?  No, no, I'm in Bisbee, Arizona.  It's 5 in the morning.  Okay, yeah, I was trying to figure out why you would call this early.  What are you doing in Bisbee?  That's where I live.  You live in Arizona?  Yeah, it's a little town down by the Mexican border.  Doug has nigger qualities.  He really wants to just drop off to earth.  But he has to get famous enough for anybody to care.  Doug is one of those guys like me who wants to quit, but he can't quit until he gets quittable.  Yeah, we got Patrice O'Neal in studio, Doug. 
[00:17:00]  But you're one of those guys that just kind of moved to Arizona and bought a house for, like, a mansion for 20 bucks?  Yeah, basically.  And it's right by the border, so when shit gets weird and FEMA starts putting people in camps for real, I can go the other way.  He can leave and go to Mexico.  Jump the border south and, you know, high-five the guys coming over for jobs.  Joe Rogan's told some pretty wild stories about you, man.  You guys have always been so cool to me. 
[00:17:30]  I keep getting emails out the ads.  Go on O&A.  They're big fans and blah, blah, blah.  And I'm never in New York, so...  So you said, what the hell, I'll call today?  Well, no.  No, I've been, like, clean and sober for, like, three weeks.  Get the fuck out of here, really.  Is that just something on purpose?  You're going to pursue this, or...?  Just to see what it was like.  And then today, I go, fuck this, and I ate a bunch of mushrooms, started drinking wine, smoking cigarettes again. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, so now I'm still up.  I get a Xanax trying to knock me out, and I'm sitting on MySpace like a fucking faggot in the middle of the night looking for friends.  His dog is just like us.  God damn, yeah.  He's a comedian that's just like you.  Someone emails me and says, hey, if you're still awake, call Opie and Anthony.  Here's their number.  And I go, I'm not going to be awake in an hour.  And here I am, chugging down the wine.  Still awake?  And I go, fuck, I'll call Opie and Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  So you're on the tail end of just being up all night.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You must get some good mushrooms in Arizona, huh?  The Indians, nowhere to get them?  Yeah, I get a good stash.  I've just been picking at them little by little all day.  I didn't go full tits out.  What made you go on the wagon, though, in the first place?  I binge on the road.  Yeah.  To the point where my fucking hands shake like Parkinson's disease.  I actually think about faking Parkinson's so I don't have to admit I'm a reckless alcoholic. 
[00:19:00]  That would be a great gig, man.  I never saw the actual video, but I saw the clips on the infomercial with you on that Girls  Gone Wild video.  You look like you're completely tanked on that whole thing.  How could you not be?  That guy's such a douchebag.  It's so not fun.  For all the fun it looks like it should be, that guy sucked every ounce of fun out of 
[00:19:30]  just, you know, naked...  The guy that runs it, right?  What's his name?  Joe Francis.  He's such a douchebag.  He's such an egomaniacal...  I don't want to say date rapist, because he would sue me for that, because that is defamation.  But, I mean, he fits all the profile of it.  He's just a...  He comes off like a real creep.  Like just a scary, creepy guy.  He's the worst person I've ever met.  And I've been with some shitty fucking people in my life. 
[00:20:00]  Like, it comes off like the chicks are all into it, and everything's like fun, like you  said, like fun and everything.  But isn't there a lot of, like, coercion going on with these girls?  Well, with him, if he's there, there's a coercion of a different sense.  He doesn't give a shit about the business.  He's there for his own personal amusement.  Just get played.  Which is just horribly degrading.  Everything you would think a porn magnet is, he's that guy. 
[00:20:30]  Just really seedy.  But, I mean, the chicks that are all into it are the dumbest fucking chicks in the world.  Yeah, of course.  So that's not even amusing.  I'm 38 years old, so that whole giggly...  I can't believe I'm going to show you this.  I don't want to...  Oh, my God.  I'm not trying to fucking talk you out of a handjob on prom night.  I'm trying to get off the bus.  It is what it is.  That's the one thing you get older, is that the anticipation of titties. 
[00:21:00]  It's just gone after you turn 30.  It's just like, ah, come on.  Pull your tits out.  You don't understand.  This coy shit is dead.  Yeah, tits are always nice to look at, but I'm not going to fight for them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't have no muscles no more.  You don't have no muscles after you get 35.  Like, you go to pull a titty out.  She's like, no.  You'll be like, okay.  All right, bitch.  No means no in my world now, bitch.  Don't have the patience for this.  You just give up the fight at that point?  There you go.  Once I learn how to pull a titty out with the two fingers and they come out the front 
[00:21:30]  instead of dealing with the back, I don't play around no more.  You're just like, fuck it.  All right, sweetie.  Thanks for this.  Did you fly on the guy's jet?  Yeah.  Well, I flew on his jet a couple times, but when I could get on the bus with the crew,  because the crew was phenomenal, I'll ride with the crew and meet you there.  You don't want to fly in the jet?  No, I don't.  Did the crew just badmouth the guy all the time?  Everyone fucking hates that guy.  Isn't he getting sued for some young girl stuff?  He's always in some shit. 
[00:22:00]  Fucking court is his part-time job.  He's gotten off on a lot of those underage things.  He got off on one of those, and a lot of the ones where the girls said they didn't sign  consent forms or shit like that.  Yeah, lawyer money.  I don't see anything about it.  And the guy is so fucking filthy rich.  Is he really?  Like, I don't know who's buying those things.  They just don't look like something you want to buy and pop in the CD player.  I find them, and it's just a guess, but it's all people who, the Christian right in the 
[00:22:30]  middle of this country that you assume doesn't really exist in that many numbers, but once  he got it on TV and made porn okay, like, that was his brilliance, was making porn.  I mean, it's the only even pseudo porn that they sell on television.  Yeah, and it was pretty, like, it got pretty heavy duty with what they show in the infomercials,  one thing, but, you know, there's pussy in there, right? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, but that way, the guys that you don't think still exist that have to lie to their  wives about watching porno, they can justify that by going, it was on TV.  Yeah, I bought this on TV, man.  You bought that fucking exercise machine.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, why can't I buy something?  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, and that's why they have fucking Snoop Dogg's or comics, a host of things, so then  they can say, I just wanted it for the comedy.  I love Snoop Dogg.  I love Snoop Dogg. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, Doug, we got to ask you about that baiting thing you do.  Oh, yeah.  With the pedophiles, and I think you go after the abortion people, too, right?  Yeah, it's so hard to do any justice to without reading it.  If you go to my site or baiting.org, we got a book deal now.  We're going to put it into a book.  Oh, really?  That's awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  Basically, he goes online and baits, you know, pedophiles and stuff, and then what?  You just have the conversations on your website?  It's basically like a prank phone call, only it's on instant messenger, where you bait pedophiles 
[00:24:00]  into thinking you're a 13-year-old girl, and then you just fuck with them.  Because once you get a guy jacking off, then you can fuck with them as much as you want.  And, you know, if you're fucking a girl, and then right in the middle, she goes, I think  I have herpes, you're going to keep fucking her.  This is already started.  Do you need a consent form to do that?  A consent form to do what?  Like, say, some dudes... 
[00:24:30]  Like, you know, to put some dude on the thing that's, like, you know, talking to a 13-year-old  girl, and you're like...  No, all you have to do is change your screen name, and you're in.  Oh, you just...  You don't even...  You don't acknowledge it's him or something?  No.  Being a beginner lawyer, I would assume that's the only thing you need to do to save your ass.  Go ahead, Doug.  I'm sorry.  For legal reasons, when we put it into a book, we'll have to change their screen name, own  the domain, or own the screen name.  Now, why is that?  Well, because defamation is any time...  If you accuse someone of doing something illegal, then you can get sued for defamation. 
[00:25:00]  I already went through this once.  Can't you just put it down and say, this is how it went down?  Here's the screen name.  This is...  It's all fact.  It happened.  The point is, like, I had a frivolous lawsuit.  Some guy, I said, was a fucking crackhead on my website.  Yeah?  The way you'd say, yeah, you're a fucking crackhead.  Shut up.  But because I said crackhead, that insinuates he's doing something illegal, where he sued  me for whatever, a fucking quarter of a million dollars, and it got thrown out because it 
[00:25:30]  was frivolous, but it cost me 10 grand in legal fees to get it thrown out.  The whole justice system is so fucked like that.  Isn't crackhead like you could call someone crackhead in the same way you would a douchebag,  and he wouldn't say, I'm not a actual douchebag?  Like, crackhead has become something you could just...  You know, someone's acting like a fucking lunatic, you say, this guy's a fucking crackhead.  I don't clean out women's vaginas.  Last time I was never there in a woman's pussy, cleansing with some kind of vinegar and water. 
[00:26:00]  But if he was in that pussy cleaning it out, that's not illegal.  It's the letter of the law.  If you insinuate he's done something illegal, like smoke crack, then you're open for defamation  suits.  It's a $10,000 lesson I learned.  Oh, that's wonderful.  So now I know to call them douchebags instead of crackheads.  Someone's calling me out that I said CD player instead of DVD player.  I caught that too.  And he's like, he capitalized it and said, I'm a fucking tool. 
[00:26:30]  John Holmes, sure, it's his real name, from Beverly Hills, uh, banned.  All right.  Do they have to...  I can understand if I said, I put it in my toaster and watched it on fucking...  I can understand if I said something like that.  I did CD player.  So, you know, Doug, when, uh, you know, you get those, uh, things, uh, and you put it  in your transmission of your car and watch it, I can understand if I did something like 
[00:27:00]  that.  I mixed up CD...  Our fucking listeners are the most nitpicky as fuck.  John Holmes is a crackhead.  And I don't mean that figuratively.  Literally, he was smoking crack this morning.  You cocksucker.  Hate our listeners.  Uh, pests.  Pestilence.  Well, Doug, you should keep in touch with us if you're up this, uh, early in the morning.  Yeah, what are you working on?  You got anything to plug?  No, no, fuck no.  Nah?  Just hanging out in fucking Bisbee? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  How'd you pick Bisbee?  Would you throw a fucking dart at a map?  How'd you get Bisbee, Arizona?  Who recommended Bisbee?  I found it accidentally just driving back roads, but it's, it's this weird little town  and there's nothing like it.  Sounds weird.  It's, it's, it's like this hippie enclave.  Uh, it, it was a mining town where the mine went bust in the seventies and all the property  value just went dirt cheap.  So all these artists and freaks just took over the town and it's the most beautiful town 
[00:28:00]  all built in the mountains.  It's not on the way to anything.  So no one finds it.  It's not like Sedona or something.  It sounds like the type of fucking Beverly Hills jack off, you know, jumps in and makes  it overpriced.  It's just weird.  It definitely, uh, it definitely sounds like the type of town that's on the graphic at the  beginning of the X-Files, Bisbee, Arizona.  You know, it just sounds like there's probably flying saucers there at night and shit.  Uh, very well could be.  Yeah, if you eat a few more of those mushrooms, you'll see the, yeah, perfect place you are 
[00:28:30]  with Doug, man.  All right.  Well, visit, uh, Doug's, uh, what do you got?  MySpace, right?  Yeah, I got DougStanhope.com and I'm on the MySpace slash DougStanhope.  Yeah, we see you on everyone's friend list.  You're very friendly.  How many you got?  How many friends?  I don't know, like 6,000 or something.  Six?  I just broke seven.  I know Dane Cook.  Dane Cook's got like how many?  Eight hundred and seventy million.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:29:00]  You got more than the guy that's instantly your friend that owns MySpace at the beginning?  Tunisia, Indonesia, all the tsunami places.  They love him.  They fucking love him.  How many does Doug have?  Ah, yes, uh, well, Dane has 667,000.  Jesus Christ.  Is that the most?  667,000 friends.  Rogan's got a lot, too.  I bet you Rogan's not beaten.  He's up to 16 grand.  16,000 Rogan's got?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  640,000.  640,000. 
[00:29:30]  Friends.  Friends.  Those aren't friends.  As much as you want to down it, it's such a great form of marketing.  Because since the whole FCC bullshit went down, I'd go on the road.  I'd do six or seven stations.  And then the FCC thing went down.  And now I'm down to, like, one or two in a market.  And one of them's pre-taped so they can cut out all the meat.  And it's just, it's fucked.  There's no way to get ahead if you're a con of any substance. 
[00:30:00]  You know what Dane can do now, though?  He could put out a bulletin to 680,000 people that he's got a gig, that he's got a fucking CD out.  It's going to be on SNL.  It's unbelievable how many people you can get in touch with at one moment on this fucking MySpace.  Right.  Well, Doug, you've got to keep in touch.  We'll promote your gigs.  Oh, cool.  Thanks, man.  If I ever get to that fucking horrible, horrible city, I'll come by and sit in.  You know something.  And if we ever come to Bisbee.  You know something.  We're reaching a lot of people now with this satellite radio. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, I know.  And you can say whatever the fuck you want.  Yeah, I just hate New York.  I avoid it like the plague.  I hate crowds.  Why don't you like New York?  You got a little agoraphobia there, Doug?  Yeah, I'm like that.  Fucking New York City's like, it's like last minute Christmas shopping 24 hours a day.  I get all freaked out.  My earth's freaking out.  It's like that, yeah, 365 days a year.  It's like last minute Christmas shopping everywhere.  Awful. 
[00:31:00]  But I'll be back.  God hates me, so he'll send me back there.  All right, Doug, we're going to give you a special number so you can call any time, especially when you're up early, right?  Shoot it to my MySpace.  Hold on the line.  We're going to just give you a couple seconds.  Cool.  Cool.  Hey, that was pretty cool.  Doug Stanhope, everyone.  Yeah, Doug's a good guy, man.  What other celebrities are listening this morning?  Give us a call.  Any other?  Maybe?  Listening?  Driving?  Wherever?  Off on a drug binge from last night that you're not done with?  Like real celebrities, please.  We haven't played this in a while because we actually need people that'll listen. 
[00:31:30]  But the last time we played this, we got the worst celebrities ever.  Yeah, they were barely celebrities.  One guy that played a dead body in CSI.  Dumb stuff like that.  One guy.  Remember when we got the guy that was in an America's Most Wanted recreation as the corpse?  Yeah, that's what I mean.  That's like...  Just playing a dead body.  The lowest rung.  I watched a movie last night where I was like, if this is your one credit, you're fucked.  Did you ever see that movie, White Noise? 
[00:32:00]  I couldn't get through the first seven seconds of that movie.  On the TV and the radio and it's the spirits coming back.  It was like one of those...  It had some scary moments where you jump...  And I hate it because I'm watching it and I go...  And me and my girlfriend are sitting on the couch watching it and she's going,  this is one of those parts.  The closer he gets to this TV screen, the scarier it's going to be when something happens  and it's going to happen any second.  And I'm sitting there going, I know it's coming.  I know it's...  Holy shit!  Holy shit!  And I knew it was coming. 
[00:32:30]  I knew that fucking thing was going to jump out.  And it did.  But there's a...  If you're playing the part of the staticky, ghostly figure on TV, on the TV,  that is a real bad role to have.  Because somebody had to go, yeah, it was in that movie White Noise.  Was he in the credit?  It had to be.  It was like people that just kind of...  And you barely see an image of their face through the static on the television.  It's like, yeah, that was me. 
[00:33:00]  That's not static on their TV.  It's not believable.  Anymore.  You don't have static on your TV.  No, it just goes out.  Cable goes out, maybe.  Sure.  You've got to reboot your box.  But you're not sitting there for 20 minutes watching static.  You've got to call up cable.  So, did you unplug the box and leave it unplugged for five minutes?  Yes, I unplugged it.  It's been unplugged now for 30 seconds, which has seemed to me like a half hour on the phone with you.  But I went, okay, Mr. Camomia, just wait a little while.  Oh, wait. 
[00:33:30]  I've got to get on the phone.  Mr. Camomia, just wait for another four minutes, 30 seconds, and I'll be here.  So, how's the weather there in New York?  It's great.  It's fantastic.  Do I have to carry on an inane conversation with you during this whole fucking thing where I just look at my box?  All right, plug it back in, Mr. Camomia.  Camomia.  You're going to see, it's going to say boot, and then it's going to go to channel two. 
[00:34:00]  I'm going to need you to pull the card out in the front of the box and reinsert it.  It's still not working.  Could you just send a service guy over, you motherfuckers?  I hate the call to cable vision.  I hate it.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  Tim, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Tim.  Hello, Tim.  I'm actually, I listen to you guys all the time.  I was once in a movie, actually.  It was in Turner and Hooch.  You were in Turner and Hooch?  Yeah, I was playing Hooch, actually.  Stop this.  It's not even funny. 
[00:34:30]  That's absurd.  It was an awful joke.  Wasn't that an awful joke?  Oh, can you imagine the embarrassment that made him hang up like that?  He didn't even stand by.  I played Hooch.  Ham-na-ham-na-ham-na-ham-na.  Lunchbox.  You can see him getting scared.  All of a sudden, he beat the sweat out of nowhere on his forehead.  Can you imagine?  He thought it was a good idea as he was dialing the phone.  And then realized he made a horrible, horrible mistake. 
[00:35:00]  Did you see how much pressure that was for seven seconds?  Yeah.  He could have...  I was Hooch.  Oh, my God.  That had to hurt.  Niggas just don't know.  He's still feeling that.  I played Hooch.  Oh, Turner, what was the present?  People are going to go, what movie was Turner and Hooch?  Oh, that was the movie.  Oh, Tom Hanks and the Dog.  And the Dog.  So, what?  Is he Tom?  He's saying he's Tom Hanks.  Oh, no.  Hooch was the dog.  Hooch is the dog.  You know he ran for the radio and turned it down because he doesn't want to hear this 
[00:35:30]  part of the show where we talk about what an asshole he is?  Hooch.  By the way, that guy, a heroin addict.  I know it.  I know it.  Let's go to Lunchbox.  Hey, Lunchbox.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Back in the early 80s, there's a movie called The Exterminator.  It's about a guy going out and killing a movie.  Good movie.  You saw The Exterminator.  Good movie.  Are you kidding?  It was The Terminator.  Sorry, dude.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  That's a good movie.  I was one of the kids in the arcade that got approached by the fucking fat guy with the 
[00:36:00]  glasses.  And he was actually my uncle.  You know what, though?  It's an obscure movie.  Dude, you had to play The Exterminator himself for anybody to really know that movie.  But I've seen that movie.  I know.  But I was fucking eight years old.  I was in that movie.  What's your name?  My uncle, what's that?  What's your name?  My name is Bob.  Bob?  He's looking at you on the IMBA, right?  IMDB, whatever it is.  Yeah, I'm looking for him.  Are you credited in this? 
[00:36:30]  I was just an extra.  I was just a little kid playing a video game.  No Bob Henderson.  This is what we get when we play this game.  I see no Bob Henderson.  That's great, though.  It's like, how about we raise the bar?  We had Doug Stanhope on.  If you think you're a bigger celebrity than Doug Stanhope, let's start there.  We don't want to go backwards.  I love extras, though.  He's like, I'm on The Exterminator, baby.  Huh?  Fuck Disney out of Arizona.  Fucking New York is the fucking greatest place in the world. 
[00:37:00]  That's why you're there.  Fuck Disney.  All right.  Fuck that little fucking dirt water cow.  All right, Lunchbox.  He played the little kid from The Exterminator.  And Opie's like, Exterminator?  Exterminator, right?  Do you mean The Terminator?  No, it sounds like...  Exterminator, it was the guy, he wore the, what is it, the welding mask, and he walked  around with a blowtorch.  He used to blow...  He was, it was like...  Ah, there you go. 
[00:37:30]  He wore a welding mask and he used to blow...  He had the blowtorch cooking up the evils in the park.  It was like Death Wish with a blowtorch.  But it was like one of the movies I love, man.  Yeah, right on.  Joe Angelo, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you today?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Good.  What do you got?  Good.  I was interested in doing the tissue time bit.  The tissue time bit.  Ah.  Yeah.  Well, you're all horned up going to work today? 
[00:38:00]  I am almost on my way to work, yes.  What do you do for a living?  I'm actually driving.  I work for a utility company.  A utility company.  So is it water, electric, or...  Yes.  Bam.  Yeah.  So you work for the electric company.  Yeah.  And are you hot?  Am I hot?  Yeah.  I'm okay hot.  Yeah.  I mean, I always have people talking to me.  Yeah.  I'm just at work.  You know, I don't have any competition, that's for sure. 
[00:38:30]  What are you, the only girl there at work?  No, no, it's mainly women there, but I'm always the one that, you know, all the guys want to  talk to and hang out at my desk, and then I would get in trouble for people hanging around  my desk and stuff, but, you know, yeah.  But I always have, throughout the past few years when I, like, I bought a car one time,  and the guy that I sold the car to, or sold me the car, got on the phone with him, and  I ended up talking dirty to him, and I just, for some reason, it just happened. 
[00:39:00]  Want to give it a shot, Anthony, or what?  Why not?  Sure.  I thought we were done with the tissue time, but...  Well...  Let's...  Sure.  Give it a try.  Don in Florida, what's up?  Don.  Oh, wow, you're way...  That sounds like, uh, white noise.  That's all you heard.  Really?  Yeah, it was like a lot of static, and then this barely audible voice, and you're like,  what are they saying?  What...  And you know that eventually, the most important part, you're gonna hear it loud and clear,  but we're sitting there, like I'm cupping my ear, and I'm getting closer to the TV. 
[00:39:30]  What's...  What's he saying?  What's...  That's what, uh, he sounded like.  Uh, I think we're gonna have a problem with JoAngela doing this.  Mm-hmm.  JoAngela, you got so much, uh, car noise going on that it might be rough to do this.  Oh, can you hear all that...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you call us from work in a back room or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can do that.  All right, give us a call back when you get to work.  Okay, I'll call you right back. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you.  All right, there she goes, JoAngela.  She wants to do tissue time, uh...  Mm-hmm.  And who are we to say no, right?  Of course.  We got a wacky underwater Santa story before we go to break.  Like, underwater Santa story.  What is...  Nathaniel's on the lookout for, like, the wacky news alerts.  Yeah.  When they're just trying to get all wacky with their stories.  I saw a tease on, uh, Fox 5 News last night that was pretty good.  I think they're doing the story tonight.  It's like, uh, uh, store...  Department store Santa's.  Uh-huh.  They're in it for money, not the kids. 
[00:40:30]  We'll tell you about it.  So, uh, you might want to keep a lookout for that one tonight.  That'll be great.  Christmas horror stories.  Oh, we got new news teases.  Ooh, look who just came in with that.  Our own Dan.  Very, very good.  Cool.  We'll, uh, maybe do that today.  And I'm finally winding down from my DEFCON.  I was at, uh, DEFCON.  Uh, defense condition, man.  I was...  Oof.  Oh, we're going to talk about that episode.  Oh, my goodness.  My tiny town of Great Neck.  Again, in the news.  We'll tease that, but, uh... 
[00:41:00]  Again.  A home invasion.  Very close to Anthony's house.  Pussies.  But first, it's this.  Santa has apparently decided to take a little break from the North Pole.  He looked for something a little warmer, a little wetter.  So he moved into an aquarium in Newport, Kentucky.  Take a look.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Happy holidays, everyone.  Just here a day, I was back up in North Pole, and I heard this loud ruckus out by the state.  So, obviously, he's in the, uh...  He's underwater? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You hear a...  Yeah, yeah.  How's he talking?  What's he got?  One of those big, old, deep-sea diver fucking helmets on?  I don't know.  How bad are you wishing for a shark attack right now?  Oh, imagine you're just getting ripped apart.  In front of the children.  And, oh, my God!  Could you imagine?  Oh, my God!  I'm being ripped apart!  Shield the children's eyes!  You think if that would happen, like, it would be, obviously, a goof that that would ever happen.  But imagine if it did. 
[00:42:00]  You think everyone that's watching him in the tank think it's just part of the act?  Part of the act, yeah.  Oh, look, Santa's getting ravaged by a shark.  Is there a possibility you would be in a Santa outfit underwater, getting attacked by a shark,  and people would be laughing at your death because they think it's part of the thing?  Oh, no.  Can you imagine?  I'd love that.  Not only am I going to die, people are going to watch me and laugh at me.  What kind of an awful gimmick is this?  I don't know.  A Christmas gimmick story.  Here's another one about a goddamn store that has the only upside-down Christmas tree in New York. 
[00:42:30]  Not anymore, Anthony.  What?  It's a trend this year.  Now it's a trend.  It's a trend.  A lot of people are nailing fucking Christmas tree holders to their ceilings.  That's right.  And putting the tree upside down and decorating it, and it is now trees hanging from the ceiling.  That is the trend.  It's one of those crazy trends, yes.  Like the hula hoop, Opie.  Not as big as the hula hoop.  In years to come, you're going to see newsreels. 
[00:43:00]  Back in 2005, the upside-down Christmas tree was the big thing.  Evil, man.  It seemed evil.  Doesn't that seem like, yeah, the devil's Christmas?  Yeah, it just seems like, come on, man, with the goddamn, it's sacrilegious almost.  Yeah.  No, I know what it is.  People are just flat-out bored with Christmas, and they're just trying something new.  Santa Claus with a black suit.  Yeah, they're trying to think up shit to make it more enjoyable and entertaining.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  We've all had it.  Who was looking forward to goddamn Christmas?  Remember Jesus' birthday?  This was all.  That's what it was supposed to be. 
[00:43:30]  It used to be.  It used to be, but now it's...  Our little Lord and Savior.  Back to Santa in the tank.  I heard this loud ruckus out by the stables.  I went and looked out the window, and there were those pesky reindeers running off and playing hide-and-sick on old Santa.  This is Santa.  She told me, you know, Santa, I bet those reindeers went back to the Newport Aquarium.  So I hopped on my handy sleigh and rounded up my magic seahorses and come all down south here to the aquarium so I can look for my reindeer, so we can get them all rounded back down. 
[00:44:00]  Sounds like Christopher Reeve playing Santa.  Jesus.  Ho, ho, ho, goddammit.  They put him in a Santa suit.  They put him underwater.  They hook up his oxygen and don't give him any material.  He just, now he's just babbling like an idiot Santa underwater.  Give him a couple of jokes.  Just improv the whole day.  Get her right, yeah.  And, uh, I'm under here. 
[00:44:30]  And, uh, I'm dressed in a Santa suit and I got an air supply.  Uh, Mrs. Claus didn't join me.  She, uh, doesn't, uh, have any, uh, hair to, uh, but I'm real, I'm flopping here.  If I wasn't underwater, you'd see the flop sweat in Santa's hair and beard.  What does he, what does he say when, uh, when he thinks he's, he's on lunch underwater, but is this break?  And how disgusting is it by lunchtime?  I'm really sick of this shit. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, is this on?  That ought to hold the little fuckers for a while.  Put some fucking nitrous through there and make Santa funny.  Santa's got nothing.  Santa's got nothing.  All right.  What's your guys' daughter?  I owe my daughter ten bucks.  I'm dodging her.  You want to buy a house at the North Pole?  Door? 
[00:45:30]  Nothing?  All right, uh, Mrs., Mrs. Bonnie Claus will be up in a second.  Perison thought he travels alone.  All right.  We'll take a break with another Christmas little thing here.  A Christmas thing or a ditty?  What is it?  It's a thing.  It's a thing.  And then we'll do the home invasion story next.  Home invasion?  Where?  What?  Who?  Uh, seems like it was very close to your house.  How close?  We'll find out next.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[00:46:00]  I'm a fancy world. 
[00:46:30]  Sorry for all the background noise.  I just opened a box.  I got another gift.  Where status is everything.  Thanks, Andy, from Seattle. 
[00:47:00]  He sent me a used drill.  One man.  I'm an entertainer.  A fancy man.  Do you understand?  There's a fancy entertainer talking.  We'll begin a quest for the ultimate gift.  Fuck you.  The drill diva.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  When a regular gift is out of reach.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography?  Right.  And the gift he gets is unacceptable.  For your deeds, you should have a cordless drill in your mouth.  Well, come on. 
[00:47:30]  What do you want?  I want a new drill.  Dude, you don't appreciate shit.  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  The drill diva took my breath away, says Eric Nagel.  Think about how I feel, hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord.  And Ben from Boston raves, wah-ha-ha-ha, dude, dude.  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  You've never seen a spoiled brat hissy fit like this.  You don't deserve to sit there. 
[00:48:00]  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  The drill diva, coming soon.  I mean, you're a doc.  Fuck you and fuck your mother.  What do you think of them apples?  Ah, I don't got this.  Fuck.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in once again today, doing a great job for us.  Anthony, during the break, was telling us a great story about getting out of a speeding ticket, I guess.  I don't know what ticket it would have ended up as, because he didn't get me on radar. 
[00:48:30]  But I got pulled over again Friday.  I'm the king of getting pulled over.  I get pulled over a lot.  I guess it's my driving.  I don't know.  Some people would call it offensive driving instead of defensive.  I am well aware of everything I'm doing.  All of my surroundings.  There are people that drive 45 miles an hour that aren't as attentive to everything that's going on around them.  I'm constantly, boom, the mirrors.  Who's behind me?  You're checking the gauges and your mirrors. 
[00:49:00]  I'm looking.  I know exactly.  I got moves planned like five steps ahead.  I see a guy sometimes, I'm in the left lane, but there's a line of cars in front of me, so I can't really speed.  So I'm doing the normal thing.  And some guy comes wheeling up behind me.  Obviously, I'm not going to pull over for him because there's a line of cars in front of me.  And I see that the gap, if he wants to get around my right, is closing up quick.  He tries to make the move, gets shut down, has to get back behind me again. 
[00:49:30]  That don't happen to me.  I look.  You could plan your moves five steps ahead.  It's a beautiful thing when you're paying attention like that.  So it was Friday.  Now here in New York, we had the snow earlier in the day.  By the time I left at about 1130.  It was like sunny.  It was sunny.  The streets were wet, but not icy at all.  It wasn't snowing anymore.  But the fucking people on the road are still driving because they're hearing the news like it's a blizzard.  So left lane has a bunch of cars in it doing 45 miles an hour. 
[00:50:00]  And I come wheeling up on this guy.  And it's my move that's, and I know I'm doing it.  It's my get the fuck out of my way move.  I come up at pretty good rate of speed.  But before I get behind him, I slow down.  And then I might get a little close.  Give him a little bump.  Not at the speed I was at.  Give him a little NASCAR.  A little bump.  I give him a little paint.  We trade a little paint.  Give him a little paint.  I give him what they call the LIE stripe. 
[00:50:30]  He gets it on the side of his car.  It's beautiful.  Let's give him a little tap, tap, tap.  I come up.  I am aware of what's going on.  This just alerts him that I am coming up.  And I'm behind you.  And get the fuck out of the way.  You're doing 45 in the left lane.  The guy doesn't move over.  So I see an opening on the right.  I take it.  Whip around him.  Get back in the left.  And I'm running again.  And you're out of there.  Out of nowhere.  Woo!  Fucking NYPD Highway Patrol.  Right behind me.  I pull over.  And I, you know me. 
[00:51:00]  I've talked about this before.  I'm the safest pullover guy there is.  I will look and make sure that mine and the officer's safety is paramount.  You're going to take care of the safety of the officer.  I do.  Because there are some people that pull over.  Fucking motherfucker.  I am sure I would have pulled over a mile sooner.  Right.  I was worried about your safety.  I'm looking out for you.  I'm pulling over so that the truck that's going 90 behind me hits him with his rear view.  Uh-uh.  That the rear view mirror hit.  You ever see that fucking?  Yeah.  I make sure I pull over. 
[00:51:30]  Right when you fall asleep and it's not going boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.  I, my passenger wheel is sitting on that so he can come over.  You've got to be in the fucking lane.  I pull over in the, I pull over in the fast lane.  Woo!  Right there.  Right there.  Right against the guard rail so it has to give me your ticket to the passenger window.  There are people that are so fucking scared that they are going to get accused of running  that when the lights come on and they're in the left lane, I've seen this, they will 
[00:52:00]  pull over to the left and pull like on that little, it ain't even a shoulder, on the left.  That was me.  That's you.  Just to fuck the cop.  And I pull over right next to the beam so he can't go on my side.  He has to go on the fast lane past the side.  Oh my God, you son of a bitch.  That guarantees you're getting a ticket though.  Yes.  Because right now that guy is so annoyed so any small chance of getting out of the ticket,  he's like, fuck this.  No, fuck this guy.  I pull over and make sure like I'm out of the fucking highway. 
[00:52:30]  I'm up on the grass so there's no more, no chance.  And he still, he goes, pull further up, further up, off by the exit ramp.  So right now I'm thinking, uh-oh.  That was a, you know, I get pulled over a lot.  That was a perfect pullover spot, my friend.  But he made me do that just because he wanted to tell me to, you know, do something.  Like, all right.  I pull up a little further.  He comes out.  He goes, uh, what are you doing?  I go driving home. 
[00:53:00]  Do you know what the speed limit is in New York City?  And I'm on the Long Island Expressway.  So I said, uh, 55.  And he goes, 50.  I had no idea.  I've been driving that road for...  If this is the truth and you're driving through Queens, a borough of New York City,  is it 50 miles an hour until you hit Nassau County?  I don't think so.  I think this guy, I think he was fucking with me.  So I just go, wow, I assumed it was 50.  And he goes, and what was that move you did? 
[00:53:30]  I said, uh, sir, there's a lot of people in the left lane doing 45 miles an hour.  Uh, he wasn't getting out of the way.  I showed him I was there and then I went around him.  He goes, oh, so now you're speeding and you're bullying people with your big truck here, huh?  See, that's not necessary.  This is, this is, I would rather...  The guy had a bad day.  I would, they all have a bad day.  No.  Lucky you.  Some of them are very nice.  I get to see all the bad day cops.  You get to see one.  I get to see all the bad day. 
[00:54:00]  I go, hey, officer, I know you're having a bad day.  Your kitty must have got hit by a tree.  And that's what I knew in my head.  It's like, I'd rather you give me a ticket.  Give me as big a ticket as you want.  But don't fuck, don't chastise me like I'm your goddamn kid.  Huh, with your big truck.  Huh, you know how fast you was going?  No, I don't.  You tell me everything, Mr. Officer.  And keep it to the letter of the law.  Don't fucking come squeezing into, like, my lifestyle.  Oh, with your big gas guzzling truck, you think you can bully people?  You know what, dick?  How about you and your woo? 
[00:54:30]  You don't, you think you can bully people?  Ass face?  Let's cut to the taser and Patrice face first in the fucking road.  I am a, I told you, I'm a professional asshole.  I go all the way up to the place where you can be a dick and not get beaten in the head.  I'm sarcastically, I can be sarcastic.  That's, that's Patrice.  Screaming like a little girl.  I'm not talking shit that I'm going to fight the cops. 
[00:55:00]  It's just, it's annoying.  Well, uh, uh, uh, officer, why, why?  You got to be like this.  Oh, yeah, my big gas guzzling vehicle.  Let me tell you something.  End the story, motherfucker.  I don't say, I don't say that.  I just, I just do dicky things.  Yeah.  Just annoying things.  This is stuff you want to say, but you don't really say, right?  I'm not afraid of tickets.  I, I, I am.  I don't like tickets.  Reports coming in, 50 miles an hour throughout the five boroughs, Anthony.  50, even on the LIE, the parkways, everything.  Oh, you do. 
[00:55:30]  I could swear I saw posted 55 miles an hour sign.  I'm going to have to look for that 50 mile.  I'm going to look now.  And ignorance, ignorance, my friend, is no excuse for it.  No, it isn't.  You can't, I'm not saying you don't know, does it?  It sounds like you had a tough time getting out of this ticket.  Well, this guy, yeah, this guy was really like a hard on, but he was in our demo, right?  He's like upper twenties, maybe early thirties.  Uh, it was the NYPD highway patrol.  So all he does, you know, is cruise the expressways and, uh, major highways in the city.  Uh, and he came up with that whole, like, in your face attitude. 
[00:56:00]  So I'm like, how could I work the show into this?  I'm, I'm really, I'm trying.  And I, I said, uh, I go, uh, my brother-in-law's on the job, by the way.  And he goes, uh, you got a card?  So I pull out the, the card.  I always say brother-in-law, even though, you know, Keith isn't married to anybody.  He's just a friend of the show, but it's the Keith card.  I played the Keith card.  A friend of mine interviews bums on the regular.  Yeah.  I go, I go, he's, he's on, uh, he's on my show all the time.  Uh, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:56:30]  He goes, never heard of it.  That is so awkward to work in.  And then I'm like, oh, I was trying.  I'm digging.  I'm digging.  I bet you he, I bet you he did hear, hear the show.  I started thinking that, like, but, but you kind of called him out on it.  Yeah.  And he's like, he thought he had you so good.  He's like, oh, I'm not fessing up to it.  Yeah.  So, uh, I give him the card and, uh.  Did he take it?  Yeah, he took it.  He looked.  No, no, he didn't keep it.  Oh, okay.  He didn't keep it.  He looked at it.  He goes, uh, is this his phone number on the back?  I go, yeah.  He goes, what would he do if I called him right now? 
[00:57:00]  And, you know, he came down here and saw this.  I said, he'd probably just laugh his ass off at me.  And, uh, he looked at the card, looked at my, uh, license and registration for a little  while, and then he went, he gave it back to me.  He goes, all right, don't let me fucking see you doing that again, which is always a funny  thing.  He's never going to see you again.  Hey, you.  It's been 10,000 cars since, but I remember every single one you bested.  Right.  So, uh, yeah, he let me, uh, he let me off. 
[00:57:30]  Let me off the hook.  Can you use, can you use the, um, the car twice, you think, with the same cop?  No.  If that guy got me, like, today, he would know me again today.  I just know he would.  They should be able to take your card after you use it.  No.  They got off.  The hell is this Monopoly?  Get out of jail, freak?  Get the fuck out of here.  They, they're supposed to take the PBA, the PBA card.  I mean, I, I have a special one.  I have a, uh, gold one there, the family member card, but we won't talk about that.  Um, but the PBA cards, they're supposed to take.  Yeah.  Because they're supposed to give it back to the guy who gave it. 
[00:58:00]  To the guy, and then if he feels so inclined, he can then give it back.  Back to you.  So, if he didn't take it, he did you a favor.  I like that whole thing, but I don't understand it.  It seems like one of the most corrupt, like, like, unfair things.  Oh, you know a cop?  Ah, you're a little above the law.  It's true.  Cops will give you a favor of the law.  If you know one, shut the fuck up.  You're a little above the law.  Do you think you'll see what his entitlement is doing?  It's poisoning your judgment.  Now, cops are listening going, you know, we're going to have to.  They're going to do this.  They're not going to listen. 
[00:58:30]  This shit's been going on for years, and I love it.  The governor of some state, here you go.  I love it.  No more PBA cards.  No more PBA cards, because that big-mouth Anthony, that entitled piece of shit, he uncovered a scam.  No one is above the law.  Matter of fact, cops are now to give other cops tickets for using cell phones.  Some people above the law in New York City will tell you about it coming up at 11.  If you don't know a cop, then you're up, Schitt's Creek.  A shock jock has broken through the thin blue line. 
[00:59:00]  We'll tell you about it.  And his death threats coming up at 11.  What did I do?  Keep your mouth shut about the PBA cards.  I love it.  The ixnay on that.  A little slice of what it's like.  All right, another big story that's happening today that involves Anthony more or less.  There's this little thing.  A violent home invasion on Long Island.  Three men forced their way into a house in an affluent Long Island community.  Happened in Great Neck. 
[00:59:30]  I have a news reporter.  Ken Rosado, live outside the police precinct in Manhasset with more.  Ken.  Good morning, Steve.  Good morning, everyone.  Certainly not a good morning for this poor family here in Great Neck.  We keep hearing of these home invasions happening practically weekly, and it has happened again.  According to police, this all happened on the overnight on Oak Pond Road in Great Neck.  Apparently, there was an elderly couple and their three grown sons.  An 80-year-old man, 74-year-old wife, and the three sons at home on Oak Pond Road.  Apparently, three suspects broke in. 
[01:00:00]  Police identified them as 21-year-old Corey Ellis, 22-year-old Carlos Ward of Jamaica, Queens, and 21-year-old Leroy Rodriguez of Brooklyn.  Apparently, three, according to police, forced their way, and one of them was carrying a Tech-9 submachine gun.  They subdued the family, was able to handcuff them.  Apparently, a son was on the phone, and then the phone went dead.  The person he was talking to thought enough to call police.  Police show up.  They break down the door, see the suspects holding guns, or a gun at least, to the victims' heads, 
[01:00:30]  and the victims on the ground in handcuffs.  The police then arrest the three suspects after chasing them into the backyard.  So all three are in custody at this point.  And maybe this might lead the police to find out exactly who's been doing all these home invasions.  He thought enough to call the police?  Like he's a smart one?  He is!  Well, what would you do?  You're in California.  The guy's in California.  He's on the phone with a buddy in New York.  He hears his buddy go,  I heard a noise in the house.  Hold on a minute.  Or, you know, whatever he said. 
[01:01:00]  And then the phone line goes dead.  Yeah, what are you going to do at that point?  Are you going to call the police?  You've got to call.  I'm not going to call for a appointment.  You think you're trying to call back first?  They said that he said that...  Hold on a second.  I mean, I hear a noise.  I don't know if he said...  Hold on a second.  But he did say,  I hear a noise in the house.  Oh, he did say that?  Yeah, and then the line went dead.  So the guy from California called his local police,  who then called Nassau County police,  who then went to the house,  and got him still there.  Well, glad it wasn't me on the phone with Norton, 
[01:01:30]  because Norton would have said that to get off the phone.  Just click.  Yeah, Norton's tied up.  Dude, I'm going dead.  Well, no, I can hear you clearly, Norton.  Click.  So he'll pretend to get kidnapped just so he can get off the phone.  Oh, dude, there's a noise.  I go, okay.  He's all handcuffed, getting a pistol whipped.  Ah, Patrice will call the cops, I'm sure.  No, he won't.  No, he won't.  He sleeps.  Patrice, you idiot.  Call the cops.  Dude, didn't you hear me say,  yeah, but you always do funny things.  You always say, shut up, and things like that.  I thought you were joking.  I don't know. 
[01:02:00]  Now, don't you think, those three grown children, the sons that are in that house,  the elderly couple, as this is happening, going through their head is,  holy shit, we've read about these.  We've read about these goddamn home invasions in Great Neck and Lake Success in Nassau County,  and what did we do to prepare?  Nothing.  And now I'm being handcuffed.  This motherfucker's got a gun to my head.  With my mama.  And I'm fucked.  What a loser you must feel like.  I wish I'd have gotten some type of contingency plan or a weapon that would have done something. 
[01:02:30]  Nothing.  That motherfucker with that Tech 9?  Surprise!  Because immediately, let me tell you something.  Someone walks in with a Tech 9.  These three.  They're not going, the first person they see, they're going to shoot them.  They're looking to rob the place, use it as intimidation or whatever.  It's not a killing spree.  They're robbing the place.  If something happens, then it could turn into a killing spree.  But me, on the other hand, I'm looking to shoot the first motherfucker that comes through the door. 
[01:03:00]  I got the advantage.  That's the advantage that the homeowner has.  He's looking to see what the threat is.  That anyone coming through that door is a threat.  Especially some motherfucking named Leroy in Great Neck.  Because he ain't supposed to be there.  Leroy Rodriguez.  That nigga.  I was a Puerto Rican and a black dude.  So you're dead as a motherfucker.  There's nothing to protect you against a Puerto Rican black man.  That guy shouldn't have been able to drive into Great Neck.  A Tech 9.  First of all, Anthony, I think a lot of times when you say this, it bugs me. 
[01:03:30]  And this is the part that bugs me.  Yeah.  They don't come in with the do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  They come barging in.  And they don't come in with the fucking spurs, chingling and changling.  They come in with the gun in their hand.  Right.  And if you do your goofy shit, they're going to shoot you.  He has the drop on you.  No, he doesn't.  You have to get your gun.  He's got to get into the house.  What is he doing?  Fucking busting through the door?  Don't you sleep?  No. 
[01:04:00]  I sleep.  I sleep.  They take shifts.  With one eye open.  Yeah, they take shifts.  They take shifts.  I sleep.  You're fucking around.  And the bedroom door is locked.  Locked.  Do you have a who-goes-dear little door on top of your bedroom like the...  The slide like a speakeasy.  Jerry sent me a little eye slide.  Speakeasy slide.  Yeah.  Let me in.  See?  Oh, man.  It would take enough noise to get into my house that I would have the drop on that motherfucker. 
[01:04:30]  You got your house loaded up like Home Alone.  Oh.  Yeah, it's all the poopy crap.  The Puerto Ricans are like...  The little...  What is it?  The Incas.  They're jumping around holding one foot.  Yeah.  The little Incas.  The Incas.  Got old movies playing to try to scare them off.  Little silhouettes of like pretend people floating back and forth.  Those motherfuckers.  Smoke bombs.  That's great.  Mouse traps. 
[01:05:00]  Whatever it takes.  I played the home invasion game over the weekend.  Did you play that?  It's getting a little creepy with the fans.  Yeah, they made a home invasion game.  I guess you could get to it through opianthony.com.  But how many levels?  I don't know.  There's quite a few.  I got past the hoo-hoo level.  You got through the hoo-hoo video game level.  And then there was...  Then you shoot the Puerto Ricans in the kitchen, I think.  Puerto Rican rapists in the kitchen.  What's the toughest...  Who's the toughest racial group?  What's the hardest...  Let's see.  For some reason, the shotgun was the hardest.  And I think that was the Puerto Ricans. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, that was a pain in the ass.  And then you use the AR-15 on everybody, I think.  Everyone that's coming.  Blacks, Puerto Ricans.  That's it?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Steve in New York.  Steve, what's up?  And you'll be totally unprepared for this.  Two of these guys came in the front door and one in the back door.  You'll be caught with your pants down.  Exactly.  Caught with my pants down.  All right, let's see.  Let's see these motherfuckers breaking into one house where the guy has a goddamn weapon.  I'm from Long Island, also.  I got the claymores and the bouncing beddies on the front lawn.  That's what you need.  A claymore.  A fucking claymore. 
[01:06:00]  What?  And next time you fall asleep on watch...  Just make sure this side face is the enemy.  Y'all think this is a video game.  I want a claymore.  You know what claymores are?  I know these days from a video game.  Click, click, click.  Three, just click this thing three times.  Throw it in the perimeter.  God.  There's ways to get you, Anthony.  There's ways to get you.  And how close was this one?  Did we say?  This one was...  I checked it on MapQuest.  About a mile.  About a mile.  About a mile.  They probably staked your house out, too. 
[01:06:30]  They probably did.  Ah, that's that damn Anthony.  Forget it.  I've seen this motherfucker.  You should put a sign on your house.  Rented.  Not owner.  Oh, really?  Not a owner.  Like I'm a cheap motherfucker?  Yeah, it's rented home.  I'm waiting.  Let the weeds grow.  Just let the shit grow.  Just let it go, man.  Don't make it look nice from the outside.  Ring it.  You see, during commercial, what magazine were you reading?  I don't know.  Which one?  You got one of those magazines with that hot bitch on the cover?  Oh, yeah, with the booty?  Okay.  Yeah.  Which one is that?  One of the black magazines.  Yeah.  Oh, Smooth. 
[01:07:00]  He's got Smooth magazine.  He's pointing out some hot piece of ass on there.  Oh, Smooth.  Look at what I'm reading during commercial.  Guns and ammo.  I got my issue with guns and ammo.  And like I hold it up and point at the booty.  You hold it up.  Look at that nozzle.  Oh, look at the barrel on that.  Oh, gee.  Oh, come here, baby.  Looking at the Dan Wesson bobtail, 1911.  Oh, my God.  Beautiful.  Bullets with cyanide drops at the top.  Oh, hollow points.  Look at this.  Oh, God.  What the hell is in these black men's magazines, by the way? 
[01:07:30]  Black women.  Black women.  Black women.  What else, though?  And rap.  Oh, they got mama jokes.  Jesus.  Right.  Black women and a couple of some...  Your mama is so black when she got cut, she didn't bleed, she smoked.  This guy says he...  Niggas got a gift to the magazine.  It's a cricket.  I wanted to give it the cricket, but I wasn't set for it.  What was the article?  You sent in your best mama jokes. 
[01:08:00]  Your girl is so bow-legged, she walks on both sides of the street.  Best mama joke I ever heard was, your mother's so black, when I look at her, I thought I was asleep.  Your mama's so skinny, she can do push-ups under her door.  You always wonder what somebody in the car is doing.  Somebody might be in the car going, oh, shit.  Oh, damn.  That's so funny, shit.  Your mama's breasts hang so low, she just tucks them in her shirt and pretend she's got balls.  Oof. 
[01:08:30]  Your mama's so dumb, she saw a sign that said Dodge Trucks and started ducking traffic.  Good.  Anyway.  What are you going to do?  That's in the men's black magazine.  So fucking...  It's probably in the men's white magazines, too, asshole.  Fuck, no.  We don't do the mama jokes.  Knock, knock, knock.  Who's there?  Jimmy.  Hello.  White people don't talk like that.  They talk like that all the fucking time.  All you black comedians have to imitate Whitey like that.  First of all, this is the actual white guy voice right here, and this is acceptable.  That's right. 
[01:09:00]  The Richard Pryor one is like, hey, dude.  You know, this is the one everybody kind of copies, but this is the...  Hello.  Also, um...  I've confused many people on the phone with this white guy voice.  Hello.  Yes, officer.  Yes, officer.  Yes.  And if you don't think you talk like that, white people, fucking think again.  This is the voice that you have to have.  This is the voice.  A white person, uh, as done in the comedy act of a black person.  Absolutely.  Yes, you need this voice.  Practice three...  Three syllable and more words.  Absolutely. 
[01:09:30]  Fantastic.  Absolutely.  That's a great...  I have a great white guy voice.  That's a good one.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Thank you very much.  Yes-siree, Bob.  Okay, then.  Head in some 50s terminology.  You betcha.  You betcha.  Holy crap.  We can take the black quiz.  Oh, nice.  The smooth R&B soul quiz.  This singer briefly sang back up to the chart-topping late 70s disco group, uh, Sheik? 
[01:10:00]  Sheik?  Sheik?  Sheik?  R. Kelly, Ronald Isley, Luther Vandross, or Prince?  I'd say, uh, who did that?  Oh, fuck.  We won't even know the answers.  You have to send in your answers.  I'm going to tell you later.  Oh, that's all.  I hate that shit.  Put it in the back of the magazine.  Oh, those nigga magazines.  Goddamn.  It's always putting it on.  Making you buy another issue.  Goddamn.  Whether it's the goddamn test on the motherfucking Beatles, they're always putting that shit  off.  I bet you the white man runs this magazine trying to get some more money out of us. 
[01:10:30]  Goddamn.  Black man, he's always late.  Y'all always late.  Goddamn.  Can't put the motherfucking answers in the goddamn motherfucking magazine.  Fuck that.  All right, let's say hi to, uh, John in Nebraska.  I want to see what else is in this black magazine.  We don't need yo mama jokes.  Who's printing up yo mama jokes?  Who's not doing yo mama jokes in the show?  We're fine.  Stop.  David Lee Roth will do you mama jokes. 
[01:11:00]  That's right.  He's going to need that after the first month.  When he breaks out the mama jokes, you know he's fucked.  John in Nebraska, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing today?  Hey.  I got a suggestion for Anthony and his home invasion security system.  I'm sure he's got a, I'm sure he's got a big alarm system, you know, being the, the,  the rich man that he is.  Uh-huh.  Poor folks here in Nebraska use baby monitors.  Baby monitors?  Where do you put it?  You put a baby monitor in the center of your house and that damn thing will pick up a mouse 
[01:11:30]  fart at a hundred yards.  And then you keep the little walkie-talkie thing by your bed?  Yep.  You can hear anything that goes on in your house.  That's a great idea.  You need one of those.  A baby monitor.  Fuck baby monitor.  And is he grabbing a gun as soon as he hears something?  I'm right with you.  I got, I got guns stashed all over the house.  You never know what the hell's going to go on anymore.  Wait a minute.  So as soon as you hear the baby something on the baby monitor, you get up and grab a gun.  And grab a gun.  That's what I do.  The second I hear anything, could be a raccoon in the backyard, you grab a weapon. 
[01:12:00]  I got a, I got a 40 Smith, I got a 40 Smith.  I got a lesson by the bed.  I got a 12 gauge in the, in the closet.  I got guns all over the house.  What's that, Chris?  That's good.  All right.  Just go right to his closet and get his gun.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Talk to you later.  The book review is in the, uh, the black men's magazine.  Holy shit, we live in.  Opie is completely mesmerized.  Oh yeah, he's taken with it.  Dude, we live in two different fucking worlds. 
[01:12:30]  We certainly do.  When is what you want to understand that?  They got a book review on Biggie.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  They got a book review on Hoodlum.  Why not?  And a book review on They Tell Me of a Home.  What?  What?  Why not?  Where's, uh, Of Mice and Men?  I don't see that anywhere on here.  No one reads that shit.  What's on the New York Times bestseller list?  I bet none of those books.  None of those.  I bet you, Hoodlum might be.  I think Hoodlum's number three.  Hoodlum?  Yeah.  What the fuck is Hoodlum about?  I don't know.  Hoodlums. 
[01:13:00]  Hoodlums.  About Great Neck, motherfuckers.  Could you just stay in the city, guys?  It's about Leroy Rodriguez.  Leroy Rodriguez.  Holy shit, Leroy Rodriguez.  Change your fucking name.  He fell out of stereotype heaven.  That moment, Leroy, I'm going to name my child Leroy Rodriguez.  You know, parents don't understand shit.  Do you know that when a fucking corporation is looking through resumes,  they are throwing Leroy Rodriguez out without even looking at his qualifications?  But see, black people figure that whole thing out.  Yeah, we spell, black people spell regular names now with black, 
[01:13:30]  they give their kids like white guy names, but they'll spell it with black guy,  like Pete will be P-E-T-Q-E.  With a hyphen over their Q.  Like Africanizing Pete.  Yeah, Africanizing Jim.  J-Y-M-M-E.  The E is silent.  Sharon, S-H-U-O-R-O-Q-U-I-N. 
[01:14:00]  With a hyphen over the S.  We don't pronounce the Q.  All right, listen.  Listen to this.  Now, I'm to the part of the black men's magazine where they talk about the new kicks.  Yes.  Yeah.  There's a sneaker out there called A Bathing Ape.  Let me see.  What is it?  Japanese sneaker makers, A Bathing Ape has finally come to America, opening a store in New York City. 
[01:14:30]  Be prepared to break the bank, though, because everything they make is limited edition.  There's a shoe called A Bathing Ape.  All right.  Fuck it.  Why people don't get excited about that?  Make your own jokes there.  Yeah.  I mean, we don't care about that shit no more.  We don't associate ourselves with apes and shit.  Nah.  Nah.  It's played out.  I wear a Bathing Ape.  Who gives a shit?  I just won't wear a bugged out eye.  I always thought that was stupid because it's not even close.  Nigga, get out of my face with those pair of bugged out eyes, motherfucker.  I don't play around. 
[01:15:00]  Bugged out eyes.  Would you like a pair of bugged out eyes?  Nigga, you better get out of my face.  Give me them bathing apes.  And those new Nike Step and Fetch it.  You can step and fetch it in the Nike Step and Fetch it.  And give me a pair of Lordy Jesuses.  Feet's Don't Fail Me Now's with the new pump heel.  Give me a pair of Feet's Don't Fail Me Now's.  A pair of Feet's Don't Fail Me Now's. 
[01:15:30]  Let's go to Kurt in New Jersey.  Kurt.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Kurt.  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Bill.  Hey, listen, now, isn't Book Review and Black Magazine an oxymoron?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Like Jumbo Shrimp.  Like it out, boys.  Asshole.  All right.  Goddamn racist everywhere.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mike in Virginia.  Mike?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Mike?  I'm an ex-New Yorker that lives in the woods of Virginia.  Let me tell you something.  There's no crime happening down here. 
[01:16:00]  Nah.  Anyway, there's another name that black people use a lot.  Instead of saying pajama, they call it pajama.  It sounds French.  Pajama.  Pajama.  Why isn't your pajamas pajama?  Pajama.  Pajama.  Where's my pajama?  Pajama.  Pajama.  That's pretty funny.  Pajama.  That's a good one.  Another one is, let's go shopping at Target.  Target.  Target.  Target.  Target.  Target.  People say Target.  Target. 
[01:16:30]  Target.  Target.  Because it makes a sound.  Let's go to Target.  It's serious, too.  No bullshit.  I say that down here all the time.  It's hysterical.  Target.  It is true, though.  Thank you.  That is true.  Let's say Benjamin in Florida.  Benjamin.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Benjamin?  Not much.  I'm a white honky.  I'm white nothing.  I bought my cousin the Baton H shoe for Christmas.  89 bucks for repair.  That ain't shit.  That's not a lot of money for those sneakers.  All right.  That's nothing.  Well, Jordan's a lot of money for 120 bucks a piece.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  All right.  Isn't Anthony worried he's going to shoot somebody like his girlfriend in the house when she  gets up to go to the bathroom?  No.  It would make noise.  Unless it's the Mission Impossible crew cutting through my walls with that saw that never  made any noise on Mission Impossible.  Right.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  And you'd hear like a...  Yeah.  Here it is.  And then you'd hear...  Like a guy's got a circular saw through the fucking wall, and it's going...  And the guy's asleep like... 
[01:17:30]  Barely turning over.  They got to make noise to get into the house.  But how do you make...  Okay.  It'll sound like someone breaking into your house noise.  He obviously sleeps very lightly.  How do they get into those people's homes?  How do they get in there?  Through open doors and open windows.  These stupid motherfuckers leave their doors and windows unlocked.  They're stupid.  I live on a four-floor walk-up, and I lock my windows and everything.  Lock it up like a vault.  And then a cop wrote in. 
[01:18:00]  He said, don't use his name because he's on the job.  He said that that family, the elderly couple, was followed home from their jewelry store in  Brooklyn.  Okay.  There you go.  That should be the first goddamn...  See, you think it's like...  These are people without a purpose.  These people have robbed...  They're staking out people, and they know what they're doing.  They're not just taking a goddamn guess that you've got something in the house.  That you might have something.  Yeah, you have nothing, Anthony.  No one's following you.  Maybe I should put out something.  Just guns and video games.  What are they going to do? 
[01:18:30]  A Cadillac in the driveway.  Oh, shit.  Everybody has one.  Butch in Miami.  Butch?  Hey, guys.  As long as you've got Patrice in the studio this morning, I want you to have him to interpret  Boo Got Shot for us.  Have you ever heard Boo Got Shot?  I love Boo Got Shot.  You've never heard Boo Got Shot?  No.  Holy shit.  All right, guys.  This is great.  Yeah, Eric's going to find it for us.  This is our...  When we first played this, we kind of came up with this idea that any time, any black community  ought to pick a spokesperson for the media whenever anything happens there. 
[01:19:00]  That way, somebody can be...  Why should we?  See, this is the difference.  That way, you can be concise and sound intelligent when you're telling the news about a shooting  or anything?  You know what?  No.  Because it's...  No.  Because I'm sick.  This is the thing that white people, the luxury you have, that you are separate from  every other white person.  So, a dumb white...  Now, dumb white person, the stereotype is shit-kicking, well, you know, what happened 
[01:19:30]  over there?  Right.  Woob-a-doob-a.  But I don't say, hey, white people, you should have somebody talk.  If a guy doesn't...  Now he's making a point.  If a guy does not talk well, but he's the guy that they're talking to, then fuck it.  I don't understand him.  We'll get the drift.  That's why black people go, you know what I'm saying?  At the end of a lot of stuff, we go, you know what I'm saying?  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  I don't care, play it, but I don't know what he's saying, and I don't give a shit.  Interview dumb black guys, or black guys that don't communicate, I don't give a shit. 
[01:20:00]  I guarantee you have no idea what this lady's saying.  This is a chick.  Ready for this?  Go ahead.  Boo got shot is all we know.  And she had to tell the police or the reporter, and this is how it came out.  Okay, go ahead.  She was shaking real bad news.  They got shot, they got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, Boo got shot, Boo got shot.  I said, oh my God, oh my God, we just saw it.  My sister had called somebody, she called my cousin, Punkin, just sailed up.  She called her, and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline. 
[01:20:30]  And Chi Chi, she had left out, and she went and got in her car, and she bailed out.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again, when I heard the gunshot,  and I seen someone had running the building over it that way, he ran that building, I  seen that car that flew off, and then I seen a long gun, a big old gun in the car.  Come on, Patrice.  That bitch speaks a whole nother, who's Punkin?  That's all I got.  We love Punkin.  Punkin rules.  I know somebody got shot in a car, in a drive-by shooting. 
[01:21:00]  She saw somebody's gun hanging out the window.  Something like that, out the window.  But how do you find, that is no black person, there's a percentile of black people, no one  understands that.  No.  Oh, we found someone that knows how to translate it.  Interpreted that for us, yeah.  Ready for the thing?  Okay.  Uh-huh, she was shaking real bad.  It appears the young lady was trembling from nervousness.  And she said, Peaches, they got shot, they got shot.  Someone has been wounded. 
[01:21:30]  I said, who, who?  I inquired as to who the victim was.  She said, Boo got shot.  Boo has suffered a gunshot.  Boo got shot.  Boo has become the victim of another violent crime.  I said, oh my God, oh my God.  Oh me, oh my.  We just saw it.  My sister had called somebody or a pimp.  My sibling telephoned another relative.  She called my cousin Punkin to sell dust.  In fact, it was my cousin Punkin who lives in this very same community.  She called her and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  Punkin was already on the phone with the local authorities. 
[01:22:00]  And Chi-Chi, she had left out.  Chi-Chi had already departed.  She went and got in her car and she bailed out.  She found her vehicle and put it in reverse.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again.  As she was departing, a shot rang out piercing the cold night air.  When I heard the gunshot and I seen some boy had run in the building over that way.  Apparently, the perpetrator was seeking cover behind a local building.  He ran in that building.  It was that building over there. 
[01:22:30]  I seen that car that flew off.  I saw the car depart with a rapid acceleration.  And then I seen a long gun.  I saw a firearm of substantial caliber.  Big old honey.  I mean substantial caliber.  The boy was in the backseat.  He had a big old long gun.  In fact, it was a gentleman in the backseat who had the firearm with the extended barrel.  How good is that, man?  Oh, my God.  That is one of our faves.  That's just like unreal.  Boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:00]  How great is that?  Boo got shot.  Punkin.  I love the Punkin.  You know that chick was just out clubbing.  You know, I got to go home now.  Oh, my God.  Goddamn police shutting down the club.  I got a photo shoot for Smooth Magazine.  I got to deal with this shit.  See, that shouldn't even be.  That doesn't even embarrass me.  That's one thing.  Well, it shouldn't.  But that will embarrass me.  You play that in front of like a bunch of black people, like a building for a black  and play her.  Everybody will just be feeling like they have to express.  It's like the bitch can't speak. 
[01:23:30]  No one can understand it.  Yeah, I don't know.  You absolutely summed it up because whenever you see, you know, I watched an episode of  cops and they go to the trailer and there's that white guy who's all drunk going, there's  a my goddamn house and I can do whatever the fuck I want in here and you police ain't  going to tell me.  It's like, I don't feel like I should have any shame whatsoever because of this guy.  The hand in the head like, oh, this is going to make us all look bad.  When did we have to start doing it? 
[01:24:00]  I don't understand.  Two things black people have to do.  We have to be embarrassed for every other black person and we have to give every other  black person money.  Yeah.  Why is that?  We have to give them.  My girl got so mad.  Oprah gave some as a gay white kid, like his dream come true fantasy.  And she's like, there's so many other black people who need it.  And I'm like, I, I fell for that once in my life when I was about 13 and I was, I gave  a bum money, white dude, and a black woman walked by, older woman goes, you know, there's 
[01:24:30]  a black man who needs it up the street.  And I was like, I stopped giving white bums money for, for years.  I remember, I remember one time, I think it was one New Year's Eve or something when we  were all hanging out, we're walking down the street and my girlfriend gave this, uh, this,  uh, white bum, uh, some money as we were walking by.  And Patrice said, uh, he goes, oh, that's sweet.  You're a sweet little racist.  We still fucking laugh about that. 
[01:25:00]  You're a sweet little racist.  Let's go to Robert in Chicago.  Robert.  Yeah.  Hey, Robert.  Hey, how's it going?  Listen, um, I, I, you guys brought up about the people speaking funny, um, um, when they,  when they were trying to tell a police different thing.  There's a guy, there's a tape that was out on the radio about, uh, eight, nine years  ago, where a guy was trying to call for an ambulance, but he was calling a bambulance.  He was so drunk.  Oh, the bambulance.  The bambulance call.  We need a bambulance.  We used to play that.  I don't know if we still have that around. 
[01:25:30]  We'll have to look for it.  Yeah, I was a bambulance.  I love you guys.  All right, thanks.  Thank you, man.  And then, of course, there's, uh, there's this one.  I like, uh, this woman here.  I seen, uh, the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man  UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Giving the man UPS.  It strikes you.  Like, you don't want to care.  Like, hey, the lady.  But you just want to go, sweetie, you know. 
[01:26:00]  Come on, baby.  And then it's so innate that you can't even remember what it is, because you, when you  correct her, you might use the wrong three letters.  Yeah.  Come on, baby.  It's not UPS.  Come on, now.  It's DHL.  Come on, sweetie.  They was giving the man UPS.  And I'm like, why would you have him sign for a package when he obviously needs medical  attention?  Brian in Fargo.  What's up, Brian?  Good morning, boys.  Fargo.  Happy birthday there, Patrice. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, how cold is it up there in Fargo?  Right there, it's actually 32 degrees above, but I did post something on Whack Bag showing  a stop sign where I live.  Oh, that was you?  I love that fucking movie.  Anytime Fargo is on, I watch it.  I love it.  One of my favorite scenes is when Buscemi and that other guy that's with him gets pulled  over by the cop, and he's trying to talk him out of it, and he's like, I thought we  could take care of it right here in Brainerd.  Right here in Brainerd.  And he's handing him the wallet with his ID in it and shit, just like not knowing how 
[01:27:00]  to fucking pull it off.  One of the best movies ever made.  Yeah, you betcha.  Hey, um...  You betcha.  Don't forget...  That's where this here execution-type deal happened.  Yeah, right.  Hey, um, don't forget to play Gangsta Fag.  Gangsta Fag after the break.  I promise.  We love it.  You promised.  You said to be reminded.  That's it.  I promise.  We just got to take leaks and stuff, and then we'll do Gangsta Fag.  Up by the lake.  All right.  We got another song as we go to break from Brother Joe. 
[01:27:30]  We're getting into the Christmas spirit, I guess.  Are we?  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Seems like the listeners love all this Christmas shit that we have collected over the years.  Well, Brother Joe doing the Have a Herky-Jerky Christmas is pretty good.  Oh, this is the song about Ben.  Yeah.  Well, I haven't heard of this one in a year.  Wow, cool.  About Ben, our producer for the new listeners.  It's going to take you some time to realize that Ben likes to herk and jerk.  Ben's a twitchy motherfucker.  Yeah, and Brother Joe came up with a little Christmas song. 
[01:28:00]  Have a Herky-Jerky Christmas  Like you work for O&A  Eat a dish of some bad fish  Just like old gravy lay  Have a Herky-Jerky Christmas  Comb your hair with a car bomb  Then exclaim, that's nuts insane 
[01:28:30]  With your big fat meaty heart  Huff and puff  You'll breathe too much  And buzz it like a beam  Run around like you're strung out  On crystal methadrine  Have a Herky-Jerky Christmas  And in case you didn't hear  Be like Ben  And have a Herky-Jerky Christmas  This year 
[01:29:00]  It's nuts, it's insane, it's crazy, it's nuts 
[01:29:30]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. 
[01:30:00]  Boop, boop, boop, boop. 
[01:30:30]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  That's pretty funny, actually.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  Boop, boop, boop.  Boop, boop, boop.  Boop, boop, boop.  Boop, boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop. 
[01:31:00]  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop.  Hey, man, how's it going?  I bought my XM satellite radio a couple of weeks ago and was tuning around while a buddy of  mine, because we drive truck, he called me up and left a message of your tissue time with  Michelle on it.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  And told me to put it on this channel, and so I figured I'd put it on this channel, man.  You know, dude, I think I've changed my radio station once since I started listening to you  guys, and you guys are funny, man.  Oh, we like that.  Yeah, we like the tissue time if it's done right, but lately it's been kind of so-so.  What's your buddy's name that turned you on to us?  Steve.  Steve, that's spreading the virus.  That's right.  There it was.  He went up to his friend John here, sneezed, boom, he got it, and now the virus is in you. 
[01:32:00]  That's how it works.  We are the bird flu of radio.  That's right.  This is the ONA virus, and it's spreading all over the guy.  You don't want to be the bird flu.  Oh, yes, we do.  60 motherfuckers got it.  If we're going to be a virus, we want to be a bad virus.  You don't want to be one of those cute viruses.  Bird flu's cute.  No, bird flu.  It's only got a few, but there's potential for disaster.  I don't know how old the episode was, but I was listening to last night, and you guys 
[01:32:30]  were talking about the regular radio stations wanting to get rid of XM and this and that.  Yeah.  And, you know, when I go back home, there's a radio station I always listen to, but, you  know, whenever that radio station back home gets to the point of writing.  Boring!  This guy's relaxed, isn't he?  You've got to listen to them.  Or I can listen to them when I'm up.  Oh, I get it.  This is like what it's like on the porch.  You get it.  Drinking a couple.  Oh. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, let me tell you.  Bottles and James.  Drinking some Bottles and James on the porch, looking out, going, yeah, see the wood line?  And I'm looking to push it back another maybe 25 yards, going to give me enough room for  a fence, putting it there, and then I'm going to fill this deck out for a little ways here.  God bless that guy.  He's so relaxed.  God bless this dude.  And it's like there's no white people anywhere going, you know, he's giving white people a  bad name.  They were just relaxing.  If that was a black dude on there, somebody would say, look, man, slavery's over. 
[01:33:30]  All right, John.  The black dude was going, you know where I was in, right there, on the thing with the  thing and the toodles with the loo-looms.  Why they all got a fucking sound like.  John, thank you.  Guys, just.  Don't let you guys know, man.  I love you guys.  All right, John.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  Yeah, well.  Looks like you have a lot of time to listen to this show.  Had to buy a couple of new retreads for the truck the other day.  Blew one going down. 
[01:34:00]  I figured it was such a good deal.  At the store, I pick up two of them, so that's what I did.  I got two.  He sounded like he had secret, like, chicken recipes and everything.  Oh, yeah, I know.  I make great, great.  Yeah.  You know, the trick of the whole crust is just putting some chewed up, crunched up corn  flakes in it.  And it just makes it brings.  You wouldn't even know it's corn flakes.  But what it does to the chicken is amazing.  And what I could do with a steak.  Let me tell you about it.  Open up.  What you got to do is use.  I only use the Weber grill, which I put on the outside and on the charcoal, none of that 
[01:34:30]  gas stuff.  And you're sitting there and all his buddies are standing around with the beard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, King of the Hill.  It's King of the Hill.  That is exactly what that was.  God damn.  God damn.  That guy don't have a worry in the world either.  And you can just sit and listen to him talk.  And he can just say.  Happy-go-lucky guy.  Oh, gosh.  Must be nice.  Jim in New York.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, fellas.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Patrice.  Hey, listen.  I turned my boss on to you guys.  We bought him an XM radio for Christmas. 
[01:35:00]  He's always been a Howard fan.  Didn't know who Opie and Anthony was.  Turned him on for the virus.  He's fucking hooked, man.  Ah, cool.  Very good.  Thanks, Jim.  That's how it spreads.  You guys have a good holiday.  You too.  Yeah, it's spreading all over, America.  One to the other.  Here's this guy in Atlanta.  What's your name?  Hermant.  Hermant?  Yeah.  No R.  Hermant.  H-E-M-N-T.  What kind of nationality is that there?  Indian.  Uh-oh.  Indian?  Yeah, India.  Dot or Woo-Woo?  Oh, India.  Yeah, Woo-Woo or Dot?  Yeah, I just got accepted. 
[01:35:30]  I got a new car.  Dot.  Dot.  I had an Indian gentleman call me yesterday about Optimum Online.  Okay.  Because I have Optimum Online and I have Optimum Cable.  But they're trying to push that Optimum Voice thing, which I don't want any part of.  I don't want my phone through the cable.  I don't want my power to go out and not have a telephone.  I don't want 911 to not know my address because if you dial 911 through the Optimum Voice, as of yet, they haven't figured out how to get your location with that. 
[01:36:00]  I just don't want it.  And my phone bill isn't that high where I need Optimum Voice.  But they keep calling and pushing and pushing.  And this guy calls up.  He goes, hello.  And you know customer service has subbed everything out to India.  So the call's coming from India, wherever.  I'm getting the call.  And again, his name was, I am Robert calling for Cable Vision.  I can know you're not Robert.  You are not Robert.  Hello. 
[01:36:30]  This is Darren.  Darren?  Yes.  You're not Darren.  It was Robert.  They just make shit up.  You see Darren calling from AT&T?  What?  Your name is Darren and AT&T?  What?  What?  What?  You're not Darren.  In Atlanta.  What do you got today?  Your name is Hermant.  That was funny, though.  This happens to me also.  But, you know, when the calls go somewhere else, then it's even worse.  But, anyway, I just got a new car and I got XM.  And this buddy of mine, Joey, he told me to listen to you guys. 
[01:37:00]  And I just did.  And I think you're really funny.  There you go.  Thank you, Hermant.  It's right in front of our eyes.  Indians laughing at anything?  Motherfuckers laughing at me.  The truth is really funny.  That is very funny.  That is really, I didn't realize.  I don't sound like that, do you?  Do I?  Yeah, you do, motherfucker.  Yes, you do.  You have a slight, you have a slight, slight case of able-double.  You will go to Pankat and find a stone.  That's how you got it.  That's what every service guy that calls me for.  You don't sound like the guy from the Temple of Doom. 
[01:37:30]  Not quite that bad.  You don't sound that bad.  You sound like you're one generation.  Your kids won't sound like you, but you don't sound like your parents, so you're doing all right.  You're getting there.  I sound like somebody who's been here for a year, so it's slowly changing.  Yeah, it's really slow.  Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit.  You still got to...  I knew when the crops come back, you are found a stone.  He's the guy that sent Indy off.  He's the guy that sent Indy off.  He's the guy that sent Indy off. 
[01:38:00]  He's the guy that sent Indy off.  All right, Hermant, thank you.  Oh, God damn.  I think we're done with you for today, all right?  There it goes, Hermant.  Keep in touch.  Hermant.  That guy has no idea what he's missed.  He really...  That guy thinks it's the Opie Anthony and Patrice O'Neal show.  He don't know what Jimmy is.  There are people listening that have no idea who Jim Norton is.  He doesn't know Jimmy Norton from a hole in the wall.  This thing is just growing.  From a dot on the head.  All right, we got to back up.  We played Land of Confusion by Disturbed.  They're going to be in studio tomorrow.  Very, very cool.  Can't wait to meet them guys. 
[01:38:30]  We wanted them to plug in and just jam.  I guess that's not going to happen.  Did you guys ever find out how...  We were supposed to...  Koi, or what's the name of that group?  Yeah, they never called us back.  That was opening for Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi, yeah.  We want to see how that went.  The cubicles, who knows.  Maybe in the new year they'll finally be out of here.  So we could, you know...  Tomorrow would have been a perfect day to plug in with Disturbed  and let them just rock.  But I don't know.  We'll still have fun with them.  And, Dan, you were mentioning a teaser about Santa. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I think Danny found it.  You better watch out.  Because these Santa's helpers seem more interested in cash than kids.  And we've got them undercover.  Tomorrow on Fox 5 News at 10.  What is the problem?  What could the story be?  Santa's helpers are more interested in cash than kids.  Now, from what they showed, it was a department store Santa.  And you know the little elves that help Santa?  Yeah, yeah.  They had this hidden camera of someone counting money.  Pickpocketing children. 
[01:39:30]  Do you think they're pickpocketing children?  Oh, pickpocketing the parents that are waiting for the children.  I'm thinking that in order to get up on the line a little,  maybe they're taking some pay off.  That's just a theory I have.  I don't know what the story is, but what else could it be?  Or are they pre-interviewing the kids and going,  if you want that PSB, give me $10, I'll put in a good word with the big guy.  That's impossible.  Well, what the hell is it?  Hey, come here.  You think it's just to cut the line to make it a little money?  Hey, kid, come here.  Dude, that's impossible with the line cutting.  Sit on Muggsy's left. 
[01:40:00]  I'll tell you what you're going to get for Christmas for a couple of saw bucks.  There's no way it could be anything more than just a couple of bucks and your kid gets up on the line quicker.  Can't be.  Because it's the store helpers that they should be wearing.  Because somebody would snitch.  That's not an undercover thing.  Someone did snitch.  But that's a snitch thing right away.  That's like if the guy goes, hey, give me a couple of bucks.  Like, oh, someone goes to the manager.  Excuse me, man.  Like, especially with his wife.  Let's face it, Anthony.  Come on. 
[01:40:30]  Huff.  I pay to get up to Hawaii.  Or the person that isn't paying would sit there and go,  why is that child being led up to the front when I was here?  Huff.  Huff.  Or if it was anywhere where some black people were lying, there was a big fuck that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-uh, uh-uh.  Fuck that.  My child been waiting.  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.  Fuck that.  You ain't going, uh-uh.  I ain't nobody paying.  There's no line cutting in the black community whatsoever, I bet.  Uh-uh. 
[01:41:00]  Got a great adventure, my friend.  It's a great adventure.  I'm saying in an all-black environment, there's no line cutting.  No, there's no line cutting, man.  All black.  In an all-black community situation, I bet a lot of money there's no line cutting.  There's not only no line cutting in the black community.  There's no space between you and the person in front of you.  To allow any line cutting.  It's like, there's no, like, you can't stand there for a second while the person in front  of you is moving.  Yeah.  You can't even stand there for a second.  Keep moving, motherfucker. 
[01:41:30]  Nah.  Or someone's going to cut in front of you.  I hate that shit.  All right.  Airport line, you're waiting and somebody, you leave a whole big gap.  I don't care that no one's getting in it.  It's just, I want to know I'm a little closer to my destination.  That's all.  I almost punched a gentleman on Thanksgiving.  A gentleman?  A gentleman.  What did he do to you?  I had family come in for Thanksgiving.  We went to a restaurant.  Screwed that cooking shit.  Nice.  And we were parking one of the cars and my neighborhood was closed down because they  were blowing up the Macy's floats there, the parade floats. 
[01:42:00]  So everyone headed toward the garages because there was nowhere to park on the street.  And we were on a very, very long line trying to get into the garage.  We had to wait like an hour just to get into a garage.  Oh.  Complete nightmare, Ant.  Dude.  That's when the grease works.  That's when the grease works.  And we're making our way to the front of the line and all of a sudden this white guy  who has a lot more money than anyone else around him just figures he deserves to cut 
[01:42:30]  everybody.  God bless him.  And he starts cutting.  Did he slip the guys a couple of bucks?  Dude, he started cutting.  Yeah.  My brother-in-law, who's from Long Island, doesn't have the New York attitude.  It's the only thing I can think.  He goes up to him and goes, hey, man, a lot of people are waiting here and, you know,  not cool.  You know, these guys are going to be really pissed.  And the guy's like, well, you know, I'm just going to kind of, I'll let maybe one or  two go and then I'll sneak in.  You know, I got a family waiting in a restaurant right now.  Oh, yeah, like no one else's.  So my brother-in-law walks away like, all right, that's a perfectly normal excuse. 
[01:43:00]  That's fine.  Yeah.  And I go, Mike, I call Mike to the car.  I go, Mike, what did this asshole just say?  And he tells me, I go, jump out, slam the door right in his face.  I go, you motherfucker.  You ain't fucking cutting this fucking line.  I just lose my mind, right?  He goes, calm down, calm down.  I'm like, I ain't fucking calming down.  You're not cutting this line.  And then he gives me the line.  He goes, I got family in a restaurant.  And I go, we all have fucking family in restaurants.  It's Thanksgiving or they're at our houses. 
[01:43:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  What do you think everybody's in line four?  Yeah.  To what?  I can wait.  I don't need my car or anything.  Everybody in this parking lot is going to a restaurant.  Yeah, you're all out.  You can't look at me killing for that type of shit.  Oh, dude.  And everyone was losing their mind.  I was the only one that jumped out of the car.  And that's what amazed me.  I'm like, none of you other assholes behind me are pissed at what you're about to see here?  These guys will do anything for a 10 spot.  You got to be discreet, though.  So then the guy's like, whoa, I don't want any trouble, and pulled away.  And then I get some beeps from the cars behind me like, thanks for taking care of that. 
[01:44:00]  Like, you're fucking pussies, man.  I'm the only one that's outraged by this?  I can't get that outrage about a lot of things.  I'll do anything to get ahead of somebody.  I never in my life have waited in the off-ramp part of people waiting to get on the right side of the road.  And it's that I go in the regular traffic until I get to the stripe line.  Oh, and then you dart in.  I go right into the elbow, and I just do it. 
[01:44:30]  I battle it out with those people, but I do it myself.  I don't.  Oh, yeah.  I just.  I can't get away.  Jersey.  Yo.  What's up, Kenny?  Gangster fag, yo.  Oh, yeah.  People want to be gangster fag.  All right, we got it.  The name of the band is Gangster Fag, or the name of the rapper.  He's a black, hardcore rapper.  But he's gay.  Yeah, but he's gay, and he's proud of it, and he raps about it. 
[01:45:00]  Shit.  You ever get him on the phone?  We're trying to find this guy, right?  Joe Rogan turned us on to this guy.  Joe Rogan gave us this CD at the poker thing in L.A.  When we were broadcasting from that last year, and it's one of the favorite things we like  doing on this show, is playing some gangsta fag.  Well, favorite?  I don't know.  It's up there.  It's disturbing.  It's very disturbing, but people enjoy it out there.  Are you playing the one about, uh...  He wants it.  He wants it.  This is so bad.  It's so disgusting. 
[01:45:30]  You want to set up the song for Patrice?  Uh, well, it's a gangsta fag.  Uh, well, the song's story is, there's this, uh, uh, gangsta, and, uh, he's a fag.  Okay.  And, um, he hooks up with this white, uh, I don't know, he comes off like a businessman  kind of guy.  Rich businessman.  Who's married, has kids, but...  Nice house, nice job.  He's bi-curious, I guess, and checks it out, and once he's had a taste of the gangsta  fag, he doesn't want to, like, he latches on to this guy, and just wants him all the 
[01:46:00]  time, a gangsta fag just, you know, used him as a lay.  And he intricately put this together.  Yeah.  In a rap song.  In a rap song, and it's just disturbing.  Listen.  That's it.  By the way, this will just outrage the middle of America.  The truckers will just...  They'll pull out shotguns.  See, I was gettin' high with my boys one day. 
[01:46:30]  Just kickin' back, hangin' out in L.A.  When this dude drove by in his really funky bands.  I could tell right away this motherfucker had hands.  Was a white dude, about thirty-something.  Kept staring at me, yelling like he wanted something.  He called me over and he asked four directions.  I saw his dick was hard, so I peeped his car.  I said, you dyin', you know you ain't lost.  You wanna suck my dick while I'm jacking you off.  And he said, oh no, there must be a mistake.  I got a wife and a kid, and I'm very, very straight.  So I said, take my number and my name.  You can call me up when you're sick of playin' games. 
[01:47:00]  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call.  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  He wants it.  What the fuck you think?  He needs it.  What the fuck you mean?  He wants it.  Cause if you see one bag, now you'll see them all.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you mean?  He needs it.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants it.  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  So I knew that he'd be climbin' the wall.  One week later, and he finally called.  He said his family's gone for a week or two.  And he was really bored and needed somethin' to do. 
[01:47:30]  So I drove to his crib up in Beverly Hills.  A poor man's house worth a couple of meals.  He said he was a gay, he just wanted to chat.  And I had five or later, he massaged my back.  In his white pool, he gave me some hair.  Went in the next room and fucked on his kids' bed.  Fuck that we fucked like bitches in here.  I came on his face and all over the sheets.  I knew that I was done when I started gettin' sore.  I grabbed the kid's toe and I wiped my dick off.  He's lyin' on the bed still tryin' to recover.  I'm dressed in a mop as my car.  I'm hurtin' trouble.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you think? 
[01:48:00]  He wants it.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants it.  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  He wants it.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants it.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants it.  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  The thing was so good that he just couldn't pass out.  So hold that week, yeah, I'm tearin' that ass up.  Cause he left to ride him and he left to suck him.  And after I was done, I let my homeboy smuck him.  Now his punk ass calls me every day.  I told him we were through, then he said he would pay him.  So now twice a week, I'm gettin' paid to tap him. 
[01:48:30]  He laced me with the cash and the visa platinum.  One month later and the cat's out the bag.  Cause this motherfucker started dressin' in drag.  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  Now it's time to cut him off, because I'm done with him.  Cryin' like a bitch and he's startin' to beg.  He's fallin' on the ground, holdin' on to my leg.  Screamin' don't leave, please twist the G.  But this is what you get when you fuck with me, ha.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you need?  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all. 
[01:49:00]  So what the fuck you need?  So what the fuck you think?  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  This is Tom's life.  Tom is not gay, okay?  I want you to stay away from Tom.  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son.  And we have a life together.  You stay away from me, you son of a bitch.  No, no.  Don't put the little song on the calling.  I miss you. 
[01:49:30]  Twisted, Twisted, please call me.  I miss you.  I miss you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Um, Mr. Twisted, this is Tim, Mr. Twisted.  I just want to know, why my toys sticky?  And my shoes, they keep sticking to me.  Why?  Why my toys sticky? 
[01:50:00]  I don't think that part was necessary.  where the kid had to call up Gangsta Bag  and ask why his toys were sticky.  Patrice is speechless, man.  Isn't that awful?  It's just shocking, man.  It is shocking.  It's shocking on a lot of levels.  First of all, he got studio time.  Somebody gave this motherfucker studio time.  And the pride.  He's doing it with the pride of a heterosexual.  Yeah.  Like, that's exactly the same song you would say.  Like, he's a tough guy. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I'm fucking this guy.  So the niggas came.  Yeah.  So the motherfucker came.  With the attitude and the pride.  Like, that's how it really went down at the thing.  He walked up to the rich white guy's car.  Yeah.  He goes, I see your dick is hard.  What's up, nigga?  You call me.  That nigga called me.  That motherfucker would have been screeching down the road  with 911 on his cell phone.  I think I was being carjacked.  Not fucking getting his phone number and shit. 
[01:51:00]  What's up, motherfucker?  Yo, so what's your name?  Anthony.  What's up, nigga?  I heard you was worried about home invasions.  If I'm there, don't worry about that shit.  I got you.  I got you.  Opie.  Damn.  We got a trucker on the line.  That's a dope-ass name.  Mark.  Mark the trucker.  What's up?  Motherfucker.  Mark.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up, Mark?  What's up, Mark?  I just can't tell you, man.  That's about the most fucked up song I've ever heard.  Why is it so fucked up, Mark?  Why is it fucked up? 
[01:51:30]  I'm talking about grabbing the kid's toy and wiping his dick off with it, man.  Come on.  Well, what's up with that?  What's wrong with that, nigga?  You ain't got no kids toys?  Where you at?  That's just too much, man.  You got room in the back of your truck, nigga?  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Gangsta fag.  Gangsta fag.  What's up?  He's a gangsta fag.  He's a tough guy there.  Holy shit.  D.C., what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, the song isn't half bad, but like you guys said, he's acting like he's some 
[01:52:00]  gangsta guy.  Instead of talking about bitches and hoes, he's just talking about another fag.  Well, I'm trying to tell my story.  People don't hear my story, so if you could...  I got to tell my shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Why's it just got to be bitches and hoes?  Why's it got to be bitches and hoes?  Why can't it be tan some man's ass up?  You understand?  Fuck that.  You can back this one up.  The black community wouldn't accept this.  I mean, I work with a lot of rap artists, and I know they wouldn't accept this, especially  Washington, which is a heavy black area.  They wouldn't accept this.  I think it would be a little rough if you're, like, touring around town with your windows 
[01:52:30]  down and cranking up granks.  Exactly.  Thanks for that.  I'll see you, I'll see you.  Yo, fuck that.  Niggas respect me and my pink rims.  Yeah, pink rims.  Hey, Stuart from Alabama says, nothing like having your stepdad walk in as you're listening  to the little gangster fag on your PC in Alabama.  Yeah, that's something you don't want blasting too loud.  And the music had just a touch of gay in it.  Bing, bing, bing, bing.  You want to hear another track?  We've never played another track on the show. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, play it.  Play it.  Just play it next to you.  Let's do it a follow-up.  Yo.  Go ahead.  I think this is called Closet.  Yo, your balls look good, son.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm sucking on some balls.  I think about the past and it hurts.  I'm just a little kid growing up in the church.  Fearing Jesus, believing in God.  Eight years old, and I knew I was on.  Staring at the other little boys in the class. 
[01:53:30]  My mouth is dry.  My heart's beating fast.  I'm in the restroom.  I'm taking the leak.  And every chance I get, you know I'm taking a peek.  They looking at me, so I turn away quick.  I can't get caught, staring down at their dicks.  I want to hold it in my hand, but I'm scared to try.  I want to put it in my mouth, and I don't know why.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  He just didn't explain it.  He's a gay M&M man with his story telling.  Because he could be just a guy that went to jail.  Yeah.  And he's not a sissy, but he's a fat.  I don't know.  He said when he was eight years old in church, he's looking at guys, little boys in there 
[01:54:00]  with him.  Oh, damn.  You really didn't listen to the story?  You know what?  I'm listening to it.  Your brother's telling a story, Patrice.  I'm trying to share this shit with you.  You're putting it out there, and you're blowing that shit off.  I'm trying to share this shit with you, and you're making light of this shit.  You know what I'm saying?  I told you I was having difficulties not looking at men's balls.  Ain't you feeling it, brother?  You know what I'm saying?  What's the matter with you?  And don't come in this motherfucker with your name being Opie no more, because I can't  concentrate up in this bitch. 
[01:54:30]  Go by Greg.  You go.  And you.  Stop opening your eyes, motherfucker.  Can we get back to his...  Sunglasses, nigga.  Can we get back to his story?  Yeah, all right.  He's eight years old so far.  He's in the church bathroom, and he's looking at some dick and wants to touch it.  He can't keep his eye off the dead.  He wants to touch it.  These are the things that I'm hoping to get.  Every single night when I'm stroking my dick.  I'm real confused, but there's no one to tell.  I know my life is doomed, and I'm going to hell. 
[01:55:00]  Because I'm living in the closet.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  See, I'm living in the closet.  Help me, I'm in the closet.  See, I'm living in the closet.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  Because I'm living in the closet.  Help me, I'm in the closet.  I'm 13, and it's all getting worse.  I'm going through puberty, and this shit is a curse.  24-7 now, I'm thinking about death.  But I'm still a virgin, and it's making me sick. 
[01:55:30]  I tried to get with this girl, just to try to get off.  But I started getting sick, and my dick stayed soft.  I knew that me and girls wasn't meant to be.  I knew that fucking with that pussy wasn't meant for me.  I met this guy named Tim, who lived down the street.  I used to sneak in his house when his mom was asleep.  We used to suck dick and make love all night.  I didn't even know if it was wrong, but it felt so right.  It was a secret that we vowed to keep.  The sex is really good, but the gift ran deep.  The truth was, I was in love with a man. 
[01:56:00]  And it was something that this world could never understand.  Because I'm living in the closet.  Read.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  I'm living in the closet.  They got their dicks in the air like they just don't care yet.  I'm living in the closet.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  I'm living in the closet.  So help me.  Well, what do you think so far?  In the closet.  What happens when he gets a little older?  You want to hear it?  I got it.  He was only up to 13. 
[01:56:30]  And the pain of him.  See, this is the thing that even if he was singing it with a feminine voice, like, you  know, and then I couldn't take it.  But this motherfucker's like, you know, I was blowing this nigger in the butt.  It's like, just, you know what?  To even tell a story about how I got stuck up in the park with a pistol is painful, but  he's just going through the life of a dude that sounds like this.  And man knows what he looks like.  And he's like, and he got enough balls to go in a studio and put this out. 
[01:57:00]  And in the rap world, and now there's going to be R&B songs, like, where he's trying to  get, like, the rap part of the R&B song.  Right, right, right.  You know, like Mariah Carey, like, oh, we love each other.  And he's like, you know what?  I don't love you, bitch.  I love this motherfucker.  I need some dick.  I need some dick.  Where's Usher up in this motherfucker?  All right, let's see what happens to him here.  What happens to him?  Because every day that I'll wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. 
[01:57:30]  Because I'm a victim of my fate.  Because this world ain't right with me.  And some days I'll just stay high.  And watch the days just pass me by.  But I still refuse to cry.  Because this world ain't right with me.  One day, me and Tim got caught.  Ain't the consequences worse than I thought.  My parents threw me out.  And I got disowned.  Now it's me against the world.  And I'm all alone.  They cursed me out.  And they called me a fag.  I left with all my clothes in their plastic bag. 
[01:58:00]  I learned that streets can be cold and vile.  And believe me, if you're gay, then it's twice as wild.  I fought a lot.  I've been stabbed and shot.  Motherfuckers trying to kill me because I don't like twat.  In no time, I learned to ride for mine.  And not to give a fuck if you like my kind.  I'd rather be dead than be living a lie.  And I won't be a fag till the day that I die.  So hell, it got me not giving a fuck.  And I'm saying fuck the world.  And I'm living it up.  Cause I'm living in the closet. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  See, I'm trapped in the closet.  Cause I'm living in the closet.  So hell, I'm in the closet.  Do you think the producer just sat there?  Cause I'm living in the closet.  And went, uh, like the song's over and he had no clue what it was all about?  Yeah, good take.  Woo.  And he did the newspaper, uh, the newspaper tap.  Uh, good.  Yeah, it sounded good.  I think, uh, yo, what's up?  Yo, I just wanted to give you my demo. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, we listened.  I worked hard on this.  Well, you know, I listened to it, uh, gangsta.  And it's a very limited market you're going for.  I think you're looking at a niche here that's a little hard to fill.  Yo, trust me, motherfucker.  There's mad people that's gangsta fags and they're gonna buy this shit.  Trust me.  Yeah.  Ten percent of motherfuckers is gay.  Now that's a lot of motherfuckers. 
[01:59:30]  And you heard me include a white boy in one of the songs, nigga.  That's some crossover shit.  I'm trying to cross that shit over, yo.  I suck the white man's dick.  What the fuck?  You know what I'm saying?  This is what I'm talking about.  Niggas can't get a fair shake.  I fucked the white man.  That could get me on a country charts, motherfucker.  Country.  You don't think the white man.  That is, he is hardcore, man.  Oh, my jeez.  That's a fag. 
[02:00:00]  I saw he has a Myspace.  Is that true?  And Rogan.  Was it a Myspace account or is it Joe Rogan's account?  It's a Myspace.  It's a Myspace.  Rogan was his friend.  Oh, it's fake?  Oh, it's a fake one.  You sure?  Yeah.  It's got pictures of us all over.  Oh, it's got pictures of us all over.  That's great.  Oh, great.  Oh, who was that businessman?  Well, you want to hear one more?  Fucking why not, man?  Come on, Gangsta Fag.  I'm looking at him going platinum.  Here's a song called The Faggots from Gangsta Fag. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, okay.  Another motherfucker, Twisted GB.  This one is dedicated to Mr. M-I-N-M-I-N-M-I-N-M-I-N-M-I.  You got something for your ass.  It's not M-I-N-M-I-N-M.

[02:01:30]  I know the truth and I know your fucking game  And I don't give a fuck what your motherfucking needs  He's just trying to get Eminem all agitated  So he writes a song about him  It's genius, yeah  He picked a white boy, but it's a genius move on  Against the facts, fuck  My name is, my name is  Mr. Shisei, what the fuck you talking about  My name is, my name is  Mr. Ciccabic, can't kill your fucking mouth  Think you could fool me? No, not to have a freeze 
[02:02:00]  I know that D12 equals up to 12 Ds  That's 12 Dicks  In your motherfucking house for ya  That's 12 Dicks in your motherfucking mouth for ya  So is it true that you blondes have the most fun?  So is it true that you blondes suck the most cum?  The next time you're with the fucking shit  Up in you, now you can brag  You got a whole lot of black up in you  You're blonde bitch  All right, you gotta  Well, yeah, they kind of, and they all sound the same  But it's like if he gets another producer 
[02:02:30]  This is what happens  That was the most genius song he did  Because, you know, it's a lot  Homosexuality is really not the thing in rap  So if this nigga is  Oh, I played the wrong one?  Yeah  Oh, son of a bitch  That's what I did wrong  Wait a minute, I wanna see if you screwed up  This dude, this dude, if he starts  But see, he pulled that shit on a white boy  He just took a, you know, he pulled that shit on Eminem  And he needs to go out there and  He's hoping Eminem, like, comes back at him  But he's not gonna come back at him, though 
[02:03:00]  But if he starts talking about he's gonna rape and fuck rappers  Somebody's gonna listen to this motherfucker  Yeah  Or he's gonna get killed  I hope he's really a gangster  So, Gangster Fag, I hope you're really a fucking soldier, dude  Ends up with some fucking bullet holes in him  Yeah  I played the wrong one  You did?

Who do you think I should drop?  You know, I'm thinking the one where you fuck the white guy is a little much for the first track  I like the one where you tell your story about, you know, how you wanted to suck that dick as a kid  So you think my life story perspective is better than, like, fucking white men  Right  But then, you know, by the third track in, I think everyone will be familiar with you enough 
[02:04:00]  And have this relationship with you, as it were  To where they would be comfortable with you fucking the white business man  Uh-huh  So you think, alright, so you think it's better for me to talk about how I was fucking motherfuckers growing up  As opposed to fucking, like, white collar motherfuckers  Well, you know, they collars be white when I finish with them all  That's right  See, now that's the fun and humor  So  You know, you gotta work them up to the point where then you're rubbing, you're wiping your cum off on their toys

[02:12:30]  Wow, that was scary.  He doesn't seem like he's walking down the street for anybody to know he's a fag.  Well, it all depends.  He could be all tough and shit and dress like the goddamn Village People leather guy.  Then you'd know.  Well, and the tough thing, too, is that no matter how tough a gay guy is, he fucks you up.  You still got to explain it.  So if I get my ass beat by a gangster fag, I still got to go.  Everybody's laughing at me, and I still got to go.  He'll fuck you up, too.  That's a big guy, man.  He'll whoop, yo, that motherfucker can fight.

Let's go to Cindy in New Jersey.  Cindy.  Hi.  Hey.  Have you guys ever heard of the Stonewall in New York City? 
[02:13:30]  No.  No.  All right.  Well, it's a big gay bar, and they have thug night.  Good answer, Ropey.  Thank you.  Huh?  And they have thug night there.  Thug night?  And what's that about?  It's all gangster guy.  Get out of here.  It's hell.  Yeah.  I thought there was maybe one or two.  It's a lot.  It's not a joke.  And see, white women think it's funny right now, that this whole DL thing.  Yeah.  But you don't, you do not play around with the DL shit with black women. 
[02:14:00]  They do not fuck around with this gay thing.  Yeah.  What happens?  It's just, it's just like, you can't even play around.  You can't even play.  Like, we playing right now.  You can't play around in front of black women about this whole, because this guy wrote a  book, on the DL, I think, and black women are just deathly, my mother, she hates that  whole gay guys that fuck women and shit.  She does not play around with that shit.  Because they're gay, but they fuck women, and on the down low, they go out and hook up. 
[02:14:30]  Yep.  Emily.  Yep.  What's up, Emily?  Hey, nothing.  How are you guys?  We're having fun today.  Excellent.  How's your dad looking forward to the big move in January?  And where?  Oh, I thought Emily.  Sorry.  Oh, oh.  I thought it was another Emily calling it.  Wow.  No, this would be Emily from Ohio.  Oh, okay.  She feels safe now.  They're all gay, thank God.  I was worried about the ones that'll rape me. 
[02:15:00]  I fucked her in a pussy and made a friend watch.  Oh, God.  What do you got, Emily?  Four guys getting fucked in the ass as their girls watch.  Oh, that can't step back.  It's ruthless.  That's fucking ruthless.  And then the other guys behind the bar, they suck their dick, nuts all over their face,  and then tells them to run.  Like the degradation wouldn't be bad enough for the rest of their lives.  It would have eaten away.  They wouldn't have been able to look at each other.  And the guy wouldn't even heard run.  After he got raped and came in the face.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  He would run, motherfucker.  He'd go like this for about five seconds.  And then he'd go, huh?  What?  What happened?  What's that?  Oh, run, run.  You know they couldn't see their friends anymore.  They'd be fucked up for life.  But Gangsta Fag, no.  It's not good enough.  I'm just going to shoot them all anyway.  I think Gangsta Fag messed it up there.  He should have let them live.  Good opportunity.  He was fighting straight, Gangsta Fag.  Gangsta Fag, you got to go get your boys, right?  Yo.  Yo.  Nigga.  Yo, we got to go kill this motherfucker.  What happened?

Someone's asking where can we buy this for Christmas.  Joe Rogan just handed this to us at a poker tournament in L.A.  That's all we know.  This is Rogan.  Did he purchase that?  I know.  Did Joe Rogan purchase that?  I have no idea.  Maybe we could get him on the phone.  I don't think Joe Rogan has anything to do with gangsta fags.  I would be very surprised.  You okay?  No, Rogan handed us and said, man, this is some of the funniest shit you'll ever hear. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, that's what it is.  No, man.  Ben can email Joe and find out.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Like, even Marcellus Wallace wasn't fucking right after that shit.  Like, he took care of that fag.  Don't tell nobody about this shit.  Yeah, that's the first thing.  He was like, first, no one needs to know what happened here tonight.  Yeah, I know.  I know, Marcellus.  Second, I'm going to call some hardcore pipe-hitting niggas. 
[02:19:00]  Hard-hitting niggas.  They're going to work up Mr. Rapist here with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  They made it edited out his friend's company after he told her that.  Yo, this is Marcellus.  I just got my soul back, right?  Soon as I got my soul back, niggas raped me.  Now get over here, hard-pipe-hitting niggas.  You can only imagine how he choreographed what happened to fucking dead in that basement. 
[02:19:30]  So slow.  Yo, this cop raped me.  Oh, Marcellus.  You know, Marcellus had to then kill everyone that killed that fucking dead.  He couldn't leave him out there.  He called Sam Jackson first.  You know how that show was going?  I mean, the movie was all going and difficult.  Yeah, back and forth.  They cut out the part where he told Sam, come on down, we got to kill this nigga.  Sam, man, something bad happened.  Those motherfuckers were talking about Tony Rocky Hart being thrown out the window. 
[02:20:00]  Like, they're not going to talk about Marcellus getting fucked in the ass?  They're talking about Rocky Hart being thrown out the window.  Marcellus threw him out.  I hear it was all fucking poop-a-sized on his wife.  You what, nigga?  You what?  Vincent, shut the fuck up.  What'd you say, Marcellus?  You got fucked in ass.  You got raped?  Nigga, I'm having a corn muffin and I'm going to walk away and I quit.  I quit?  I ain't killing nobody else?  You called a wolf to clean that shit up.

You want him to take that band-aid off your neck and put it on your ass?  Here's so.  Boom.  Any other jokes?  Yeah, Marcellus, I'd rather die than than not joke about you getting fucked in your ass.  You are not the boss no more, nigga.  I'll take a pat or a pack of red assholes.  Red apple. 
[02:21:30]  Shit.  I knew I'd say that in front of him.  Oh, my God.  Gangsta fad.  What a find.  Let's go to Devil Dan.  Devil Dan, what's up?  No, we lost Devil Dan.  He was wondering if that's a soundtrack to Oz.  Let's say hi to Rob in Montana.  Rob.  Yeah, hi.  Even a redneck motherfucker like me thinks this is funny shit.  Oh, right on, man.  Because rednecks ain't scared.  That Ohio guy.  Rednecks ain't giving a fuck about some gangsta.  Rednecks don't care.  They want a gangsta fag to come running around.  You know what I mean?  You go up to the northern states like that in the middle of the country. 
[02:22:00]  Now there's someone to go like, hey, hey, hey, enough of this.  I've got to drive my car, and people are listening in the carpool.  This guy, he's going to play that against them when they're practicing with their Jewish dummies.  What do they call them?  They use the Jewish dummies down at the firing range.  Jewish dummies.  And they release the dogs on the black dummies. 
[02:22:30]  And they're not worried about it.  They're going to play gangsta fag just to keep it.  All right, fellas, we've been, our momentum has been a little down lately.  We haven't been doing what we're supposed to do.  So I'm going to motivate you by letting you know what's out there.  Hit it.  I'm going to fuck you in the butt.  Oh, shit.  Lock and load, boys.  And we're going to play this music real loud.  Oh, yeah, they just be unloading.  What the fuck?  I'm going to shoot the speakers. 
[02:23:00]  Everyone's trying to get in right now.  Weal in Denver.  Weal, what's up?  Hey, what's up with these chicks calling in, talking about how funny this is.  This is the most frightening shit I've ever seen.  You know why it's fucking funny?  Because it's you getting right now.  It's the bare men.  It's like women are like, see how it feels?  And they're just like, yay.  When it's hoes and shit, that's fine.  We'll listen and laugh and shit.  But when it's like a guy, you're like, all of a sudden, hey, I've, you know, I've said 
[02:23:30]  some bad things about gay people in a bar and I've left out the door with my friends  and all of a sudden, a gun is in my mouth and all of a sudden, we have become the hoes.  Thanks to fag makes me suck his dick.  And then, wait, then you see how guys do and we want to relax ourselves with this type  of shit.  We go, all right, um, all right, would you rather get shot in the head or suck a dick?  Um, I don't know.  I say, oh, shoot me, motherfucker. 
[02:24:00]  I know, I love the stories that come up.  It's like, dude, I would bite that motherfucker's cock off for the last fucking time he ever,  so you wouldn't have a cock in your mouth, faggot.  Just saying, no, for survival.  Right.  I'm in prison, you know, the first guy tries to rape me, getting his fucking dick bit off  and then they leave me alone.  Motherfucker, he's so, I'll put on my Freddy Krueger gloves and trick him. 
[02:24:30]  I'll make a ring.  I'll act like I'm hair jobbing him, slice his dick off.  I'll get a job in a fucking license plate factory and I'll make a metal ring with fucking  jagged edges.  I'll shove that up my ass 24-7.  That fuck, first person tries to fuck me, they're pulling shredded meat out of the fuck.  That's what I do.  Yeah, sure.  That's what you do.  That's why he's going to jiggle around in there with a plunger handle first.  Make sure it's safe.  Gangsta fag has it all figured out. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  You put your ass in the air.  Yeah.  And you're like, I'm going to get him, I got something to shred.  If you got something that'll shred my dick in your ass, I'm going to shoot you in the  back of your motherfucking head.  God, motherfucker.  Motherfucker tried to put some shit up his ass.  He tried to shred my dick, but I was very quick.  Let's go to Craig the Trucker.  Next thing you know, I shanked a bitch.  I'm a shankin' fag.  I'm a shankin' fag out in the yard, looking at the boys, getting hard.

[02:26:00]  All right, Craig.  Gangsta fag is just hilarious.  Gangsta fag.  Because you could, the fear.  This is scary.  Because if he was on there going, you know, I flew in my plane and I landed on his balls.  People would be like, this sissy motherfucker.  But this dude's like, yo, I took this, I smashed his face up again.  And then I, and then I mushed his head up in the toilet.  It's just like, this is fear.  This is prison coming out in the open.  This is it.  This is the fear.  Thank you, gangsta fag. 
[02:26:30]  I'm bringing the yard to you.  I'm bringing the yard.  He's bringing the fucking, the little nook and cranny in the laundry room right to your  back door.  That's it.  This is visceral shit.  What happened?  I thought you had to be locked up for this shit.  Not with gangsta fag.  Rick, the trucker.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I'll tell you what, I turned my XM on this morning.  I heard that shit.  I thought my damn fucking XM broke on me.  I'm fucking your ass.  I'm gangsta fag. 
[02:27:00]  Make ass bleed.  I won't even use a bag.  Oh, he's not using a bag.  I can't wait until he makes it about raping rednecks.  I took him by his goatee and I fucking rode his booty.  I fucked him in the back of his NASCAR car.  John in Jersey.  John.  Ah, John, go.  He had a good one, too.  Tissue time with gangsta fag.  That would have been a great line. 
[02:27:30]  I snuck into his trailer.  In the trailer park.  Yo, we want to thank Joe Rogan for turning us on to gangsta fag.  Good God, mother of Jesus.  He gave that to us at the World Poker Tour.  Only Rogan could find something like that.  Did he go, hey, Joe, what's up, man?  I know you host UFC.  There's a lot of karate going on up in this bitch.  But I was wondering, my name is Gangsta Faggot, right?  No offense, man. 
[02:28:00]  I know you know your shit, your karate and shit.  I mean, I got a gun in case you want to do that karate shit up in here.  I needed to make rednecks suck my dick.  I need the gun.  You know, I just was raping niggas and shit.  But I wouldn't rape you, Joe.  But I know you know niggas, right?  You think this guy's for real or you think it's some rapper that's just fucking around?  His voice is hard.  It sounds a little bit like insane clown posse.  It sounds...  Usually you can't fake hard.  I don't think you could fake being like that. 
[02:28:30]  Like, you know, I'll try.  I can fuck around.  But I can't fake more than hard.  You can't fake hard.  He sounds like he...  I think this guy grew up, right?  Got his ass kicked a lot growing up.  He can fight.  He can definitely fight.  But then, like, decided he reached a point where he's like, that's it.  I'm hitting the fucking gym.  Yeah.  He hit the fucking way.  He had those goddamn Tukey arms on him.  Those fucking...  That's what I'm saying.  Tukey Williams arms on him.  That's what I'm saying.  And now he's just choking shit out. 
[02:29:00]  Choking.  I'm going to choke you to your almost unconscious.  Just...  You just have enough consciousness to know I'm fucking you.  Oh, my God.  That's what it is.  He can fight.  It sounds...  You know, maybe the stories were a little bit exaggerated, but he sounds...  I don't think he fucked that white guy.  I don't think he wiped his cum on the kid's toys.  After all that shit, he's like, you know what?  I ain't buying that shit.  That's a little too far. 
[02:29:30]  Nah, he didn't fuck that.  Some DJ didn't think I was telling the truth.  I fucked his ass and cum on his tooth.  I think that motherfucker might be...  I don't know.  You never know, man.  A lot of talk, but...  If he's got enough balls to try to be famous with this gig...  Yeah.  He's not a pussy.  You know, I use the term...  Well, that's your bold statement there.  He's a pussy.  Jim's got a comment.  Jim in New York.  Yeah, this is how Andrew Dice Gay would sound like. 
[02:30:00]  Andrew Dice Gay.  Hey, huh?  So I'm hanging out with these fags.  Hickory dickory dock.  Hey, hey, write your own joke.  Oh!  Dice was good.  There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.  I hate chicks, so I found the guy to swallow my goo.  Oh!  There was an old man that lived in a boot. 
[02:30:30]  I fucked him most...  I fucked him so hard.  He had to poot.  Oh!  Andrew Dice Gay.  I'm the Dice Man lover.  See my sparkled, bedazzled jacket?  My leather?  Yeah, yeah.  Used to say dice.  Now look.  Faggot.  I just wrote in rubies and rhinestones.  Big faggot.  That's what I do now. 
[02:31:00]  I'm over here now.  I used to be over there.  Now I'm over here by the man ass.  You ever just shove your nose in a man's asshole and take a whiff?  Isn't it beautiful?  It's beautiful.  And then he...  After he do it, he goes...  So this guy walks up to me and goes...  Dice, will you suck my cock? 
[02:31:30]  I said, sure, I'm a faggot.  Oh!  You hear me?  I blow you.  You hear?  Oh, shit.  All day long.  Suck my cock, Dice.  All right already.  Pull it out.  I don't want to sleep in the wet spot.  The whole bed's a wet spot.  I've been fucking you for hours.  Oh!  Andrew Dice Gay. 
[02:32:00]  Instead of Dice, it's faggot.  Instead of Dice.  Jack and Jill went up the hill.  Jill came down.  I went up and blew Jack.  It don't rhyme.  It just happened that way.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  The fear running around in Midwest right now.  It's just, these truckers, it's scary.  Yeah.  There's nothing gay about that. 
[02:32:30]  They don't like it.  Just relaxing.  That's where this Brokeback Mountain shit is going to just...  That's my favorite movie.  Two cowboys.  They're in love.  And they can't even show and share their love with each other.  How sad.  Isn't that sad?  How do I quit you?  Oh!  How do I quit you?  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  That ass I can't quit.  I shoot a load of goo. 
[02:33:00]  I used to joke about that.  Now it's a sweet, precious gift.  It's a sweet, precious gift between two men.  I give.  Two faggots walk into a bar.  It's me and a friend. 
[02:33:30]  It's not even a joke here.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I like that gangsta fag.  Yeah?  Gangsta fag?  I fucked him.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  And imagine if gangsta fag look like Tukey. 
[02:34:00]  Tukey.  Tukey Williams.  Oh, I know.  That's even more frightening.  They've shown pictures.  How old is Tukey now?  He's probably 50-something.  He's 50-something.  I've seen recent pictures of them,  but they don't like showing those recent ones on the news.  They showed shit from when he was first arrested.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And his arm looks like his arms are my thighs, man.  It's fucking holiday hams.  He's got these huge...  I've really never seen arms like that.  The biggest arms I've ever seen, really.  Yeah.  The biggest arms I've ever seen, man.  So imagine if gangsta fag is like went to prison and did some more crazy shit. 
[02:34:30]  Not a chance.  And he's just a big motherfucker like that.  But he's probably a sweet man.  You know, deep down, all men just want to be loved and hugged.  I didn't realize this.  When I was being angry towards women sexually,  I didn't realize it was because I was just a man looking for the love of a man.  Little boy blue.  It was me.  Oh! 
[02:35:00]  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Whip it out.  I'll suck that dick.  Oh!  Look at Pat from Manaki.  He's got to go up.  I didn't see feedback.  They're coming in like crazy now.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  I haven't left this hard in a long time.  Oh, God, man. 
[02:35:30]  Show him online at the bank,  and I got my tongue up this guy's ass.  And he's like,  why do you got your tongue up my ass?  I said,  because I'm a faggot.  Oh!  Goosh right in my face.  Goosh.  What can I say?  I love to cum.  I love to cum.  It's like, 
[02:36:00]  to me,  it used to be nasty.  I would give it to broads and go,  take my nasty goo.  Ugh.  Now it's like sweet strudel icing.  Just drizzled on dice.  Andrew Dice Gay.  The faggotito.  Which way?  Which way? 
[02:36:30]  Which way?  You bet.  Up the ass!  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Well, Gunny from PA wants to know,  hey, Ed,  it's Brokeback Mountain,  a documentary about you and Richard in California.  Yeah, that was it.  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  Wow. 
[02:37:00]  Bravo, Anthony.  It's like old school Anthony right there.  Well, Joe Rogan gave us Gangsta Fag at the World Poker Tour,  and I was going to try to tie in this bowdog.net.  Oh!

[02:38:00]  It's bowdog dot net.  You and Anthony and Cyrus.  Cyrus.  Get infected.  You know what we should do in the very near future?  There's a lot, you know, it's a national show,  and there's a lot of people listening  that have never been to New York,  and we focus on New York a lot on this program.  It would be really interesting to take phone calls  from some of these people  and have them give what they think New York's all about.  Their impression?  I was just talking to somebody about this yesterday.  Really?  Because a lot of people have an impression,  you say you're from New York,  and they think, you know, you're from Brooklyn. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah, you know, hey, hey, hey, hey, what the fuck?  You know, whereas New York State,  probably one of the most diverse states.  You got one of the biggest cities in the world.  Then you drive a few miles,  there's fucking cow farmers,  and you're smelling cow shit upstate.  Buffalo is Canada.  Oh, yeah, it is.  You know, you got the Long Island,  you got the beaches.  Even the city itself is not the exact,  like, the people who are front in other places 
[02:39:00]  that visit New York are the meanest people you meet,  because they're trying to do the handbook  of not getting old fucked over New York.  Excuse me, half the time?  I ain't going to fall for the old.  What time is it?  Take my wallet and rape my wife?  Trick?  That's so true.  Yeah.  I heard about you, fellas.  Have this new change for a dollar?  I think I'm going to fall for the change for a fucking dollar?  How about this one?  You're going to New York,  watch out for that three-card Monty.  Three-card Monty?  Yeah, I've been playing three-card Monty since, what, 1979? 
[02:39:30]  They do it now with a laptop on a table.  This guy's got a fucking laptop in his mouth.  All right, which card?  Click, click, point, click, point, click.  I thought it was that one.  Click, click, click, point, click, click, point, click, click, point.  Which one?  I'm hoping, baby.  Which one?  Motherfucker.  I thought it was point, and it was click.  Click, click, point, click, click, click, click.  I owe this motherfucker 20 bucks.  Watch out for that three-card Monty.  God damn, he had an extra click in that motherfucker.  The guy before me, right before me, was winning, winning, winning.  I come up next, point, click, point, click, click, and it was fun to point. 
[02:40:00]  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Oh, wow, that was really funny.  I haven't seen a three-card Monty fucking guy.  Put out the table, man, and come in.  Come in.  Don't even give a shit about three-card Monty.  I've gotten that one when I travel around, like,  what's up with that three-card Monty, man?  I hear that's hard.  Monty?  Pretty scary, and you can't win ever on that game.  Nice.  You're not putting a three-card Monty anymore.  Well, 23 skidoo.  Hubba, hubba.  Look at the stems on that game.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Saturday Night Radio. 
[02:40:30]  The ONA virus.  Oh, it's a virus, all right.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in for Jimmy Norton. 
[02:41:00]  Hello.  Last week and this week.  How you doing?  Good, Patrice.  You have something going on that you actually are able to tell the fine folks?  Yeah, I'm plugging in something.  It's in January.  I've got to get the exact dates, but I'm going to be at Helium Philadelphia in January  and also in Houston at the last stop in January.  There you go.  So I've got to get the dates, but I don't know.  All right, so he's going to be there.  That alerts them to know, to keep listening for details.  Patrice is just hilarious on the stage, man, too.  Absolutely hilarious, and always changing up the act. 
[02:41:30]  I like that about some of you guys.  There's a bunch of things going on.  Oh, we're going to be doing a thing, too, Anthony.  A thing.  This Wednesday, we're doing a very rare appearance.  Oh, we don't do many of these these days, huh?  No, we don't.  I think we'll have tons of stuff to give away.  It's at J&R Music World, downtown, Park Row, down near City Hall, across the street from  City Hall, I believe.  Across from City Hall, yeah.  It's way over there.  That's all I know.  Way downtown at J&R Music World.  This Wednesday at 1230, we'll be there, signing stuff, giving stuff away. 
[02:42:00]  Are we going to get any deals?  Can we swing some discounts for us?  I'm hoping.  I love when we do things at electronic stores or places like J&R, go in there and talk to  the manager.  Hey, can we get hooked up with one of those?  Is this a connection to J&R?  Are you pumping them up also?  Are they getting some of these?  Well, yeah, they get a little, you know, they get a bunch of people that come down.  And the weird thing is, we're doing it for free, and, you know, if we had a real agent, 
[02:42:30]  he'd be on top of this stuff.  We're doing appearances for free.  Who looks after you guys?  Opie.  It's because we enjoy going out.  I really don't know who looks after us these days.  And I'm not even fucking around anymore.  I really don't.  Who's your guy when there's a problem?  When there's a problem with the car or a problem with something?  Who's the...  Well, a car I call Elo, as we've heard on the air.  But there you have it.  So maybe they'll do something nice for us, because we're spending our time down there. 
[02:43:00]  I like J&R.  J&R Music World, yes.  This Wednesday, 1230, downtown Park Road near City Hall or across the street from City Hall.  Doing some Christmas shopping?  Come on by.  Say hi.  Yeah, we'll get a lot of stuff down there to give away.  All right.  Let's say hi to Boston Strangler, one of the faithful.  Boston Strangler, what's up today?  Not so much, boys.  I'm just calling to promote our Million Pests March, which is going to be this Friday outside  the K-Rock Studios.  All right.  Yeah, well, you guys are gathering as well, right? 
[02:43:30]  Yes, we are.  We have approximately 200 people now for...  Are they confirmed, or are these...  There's a bunch of bozos that say they're going to show up, and then they never show up.  I see you guys bitch about that all the time.  These are confirmed.  This is confirmed through BAM, who's heading up the confirmations process, shall we?  All right, so what time are you guys getting together?  We're getting together probably around 10 o'clock, because March starts at 11, and from 
[02:44:00]  there, you can get in touch with either myself, BAM, or Doug on whackback.com.  All right.  The ONA Army's getting together for a little something-something on Friday.  Cool.  You guys got to stay peaceful.  Oh, we will.  We have a whole...  We've been in a lot of trouble lately, so we're counting on you guys to be very peaceful,  okay?  Yep.  We have a whole set, so nobody gets into trouble.  Like Gandhi.  We have t-shirts.  All right.  We have everything else, so it's all set, and...  We'll stop by our show on Friday as well, because we got stuff to give away. 
[02:44:30]  We'll just start handing out whatever we have.  I think we have a bunch of shirts and stuff, okay?  Excellent.  Sounds good.  I'll see you guys then.  All right.  Very nice.  Take care.  Yeah, they're...  They're planning some things.  Some things, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Good for them.  Howard's doing his cute march on Friday, and our pesticide, they needed to be there.  Friday's the last turn of the show?  To raise some havoc.  I guess so, yeah.  Last turn of the show.  To raise some peaceful havoc. 
[02:45:00]  Over there at K-Rock.  All right.  Kong.  Four-star reviews all over the damn place.  Two more four-star reviews coming in.  Daily News.  When do we get to see this movie?  Opens Wednesday.  Oh, Wednesday?  Yeah.  It's some kind of thing they do where they want this huge opening weekend tally.  Right.  So then by Sunday, they actually have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday under this,  so it looks like it's a huge amount right after the weekend.  It's going to be huge.  I don't think you're going to need trickery with this thing, unless, of course, a lot of 
[02:45:30]  people are thinking, like Patrice O'Neill.  Now, I think this movie's going to be giant, huge.  It has to make over $500 million to break even.  Is that what they're saying?  It costs $207 million to make.  And then promotions.  Then the promotions.  Then his salary.  And he gets 20%.  It's $20 million or 20% against the gross or something like that.  Dude, this will do worldwide over a billion.  It has to make that much for it to be a hit. 
[02:46:00]  $500 million is breaking even.  This thing is going to make Titanic money.  Why do you think that?  Titanic money.  Why?  Because it's got everything that people want.  It's got the dumb love story.  It's got the action.  Yep.  Love story, action.  Love story, action.  Big creature.  Lord of the Rings made what?  Lord of the Rings made...  The Rings made insane amounts of money, too.  Not record-breaking.  It wasn't in the top five or anything like that.  Made some big money.  Big money, but I'm saying to make a billion dollars...  Lord of the Rings was kind of a niche.  And it was a little niche. 
[02:46:30]  It was a little niche-y.  Dungeons and Dragons.  A little niche-y.  Although it brought in a lot of the mainstream, yes, of course.  So King Kong is not niche-y?  This is all about mainstream, man.  This is what people want in a movie, is what everyone is saying.  Now, Patrice isn't going to see it.  Patrice, it's getting four-star reviews.  It's going to be just massive.  Patrice not seeing King Kong?  You might be surprised as to why.  Check in at 11.  We'll tell you why.  They don't have enough screens to put this movie on.  It's going to be one of those movies you're going to see five or six screens dedicated to it. 
[02:47:00]  I wish I could see it.  I wish I could see it.  He can't.  I can't see it.  Why can't you see King Kong?  Or Kong, whatever.  They're calling it Kong, officially?  Emotionally.  He doesn't want...  I'm not going to be able to see it.  This is one of those movies, and in every review they've said this, every review,  they've walked out and seen grown men weeping.  I'm not...  I can't deal with this.  Weeping, crying.  Over Kong?  At this movie.  Yes.  Yeah, man, because they got him as this in love motherfucker.  I don't want to see that.  I want to see rampage and destruction.  So you go, all right, he should... 
[02:47:30]  Like, in the first, the very first one, Fay Wray was not in love, but he was a rampaging  beast who just goes, ooh, a white woman, and just carries her around.  She was scared, shitless, screaming the whole movie.  She was a possession.  Right.  She wasn't, like, somebody that loved him back, and, like, this girl loves him in the  whole fucking movie.  And I don't want to...  I just can't deal with what that's going to...  I won't be able to deal with it.  You're really saying guys are crying?  Fucking Patrice.  Lord of the Rings.  That didn't make that much money, did it?  How much did it do? 
[02:48:00]  Lord of the Rings, Return of the King.  1.2 billion.  1.12...  Oh, 1.1 billion.  1 billion, 129 million.  Together or just one?  This is just one.  This is the last one they did.  Worldwide?  Right under...  It's number two right under Titanic.  Is it really?  Lord of the Rings, Return of the King.  All right.  And then you've got to go down to fifth place for Two Towers.  How about the first one?  The first one...  Where's the first one?  Had to make the top 20.  Stop it.  The Fellowship? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, Fellowship.  Yeah, Fellowship.  $860 million.  In 10th place.  So all three of them are in the top 10 gross worldwide.  All right.  Finding Nemo's in there.  Jurassic Park is sixth.  So Jaws is no longer in there.  Star Wars movie.  All those old school top ones.  Yeah, when it was like fucking a dollar to get the...  48 hours, man.  That was like number 46.  48 hours, man.  There's got to be a better way to keep track of this because it's not fair to the old school 
[02:49:00]  movies.  Yeah, the old school movies.  I paid $3.50 and I was including the popcorn.  This is adjusted money.  Oh, they do do that?  Yeah, I remember hearing something on the news about movie growths and they always do it  in adjusted money.  Why don't they just count total tickets?  I keep putting this paper...  Total tickets sold?  Yeah.  I think they do.  Total tickets sold and then they apply the new price for those tickets.  Let me tell you something.  It's a bunch of horse shit.  I'm going to tell you who fucked up this whole...  Remember there was a time where you did not count the world in this movie shit?  What started it?  Total Recall started it. 
[02:49:30]  Where they go...  Where it made like $17 here, but it made $400 million.  Oh, and then they started this whole worldwide sales.  And that's the bullshit.  America's the only one that counts.  And then worldwide, it's not going to open until...  That's another thing they didn't do.  They didn't open movies overseas until like 50 years later.  So now they open at the same time.  And this is all trickery.  But the reason I keep covering your paper, Opie, I know I keep throwing something over 
[02:50:00]  there, is because on the front of the post, they have the picture of the death of King  Kong.  Like you can see he's dying and then she's sitting there.  I don't like it.  Now I know there's a bunch of people with, oh, guerrilla jokes are coming, I know.  But it's like, I don't want to see this with this sad shit.  I want to see him need to get killed.  Rampaging monsters you don't have a problem with.  Like Peter Jackson was saying, oh, when he's in New York, it's not going to be like him  killing everybody.  It's going to be like him as a scared animal.  I can't deal with it.  So he's scared running around. 
[02:50:30]  Like if he picks up a bus and, you know, rips it open, he's just looking for the girl  he loves.  And then he's scared of everything.  He's scared and then he goes to the Empire State Building to relive the moment that they  had on the island.  Fuck that.  Oh, boy.  I don't need that in my life.  I hear there's some cool scenes where he's running around because he can't find her.  And he's picking up like blondes off the street, looking at him and then just heaving him down  onto the ground.  Now, if he does that, I'll go see that.  If somebody can assure me that he throws a couple of women that's not him. 
[02:51:00]  But I'm sure it's not in a nasty way.  It's in a where's my sweetheart way.  The remake, he did that.  He saw her and picked her up and said, ah, fuck this.  This ain't her.  If I could see a couple of scenes where he kills somebody callously, I can deal with it.  But this is no, even that though, a couple of scenes isn't going to compensate for the  emotion they put into this.  It's not like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park where it's just a rampaging, I want to kill you  monster, and you have no feeling for it.  And they didn't even kill that nigga. 
[02:51:30]  No, no.  He got to live it.  He wasn't in love with nobody.  He was going to eat your children.  That nigga was out for blood.  Kong is just a man.  He's a lonely on that island.  The whole thing.  Listen, the original, when they shoot him, I get sad.  I always want things to win.  In 1933, that movie was made.  It's all claymation where he's trying to get some eyebrows moving.  And he ate a villager, put him in his mouth.  He stepped on a villager.  He stepped on.  And in the remake, he killed, what's the guy's name name? 
[02:52:00]  He's talking about the remake from 1976.  The remake from 1976.  He killed, what's his name?  Stepped on him.  Yeah.  Did a couple of things that you go, okay, you can kill him now.  This one, Peter Jackson goes, he didn't edit the ending.  He couldn't sit in the room.  He couldn't sit in the room because he got so attached to King Kong.  Oh, boy.  That's what he said, and I believe him.  He said he let, he came and saw the ending.  He couldn't edit the death of King Kong at the studio. 
[02:52:30]  That's what Peter Jackson said.  They're saying the death scene, the end of this, is so emotional.  I'm not going to watch it.  And so, like, you absolutely feel for this animal.  We got someone on the line that actually saw the movie there.  Big Kev, what's up?  Oh, that's right.  What's up, guys?  Oh, yeah, Big Kev saw King Kong.  What do you got?  Hey, Therese, you will regret it if you don't see this movie on a big screen.  Look, man, tell me, look, I'm telling you why I don't want to see it.  I don't want to see it because I'm making a step.  I just emotionally, I'm already sad looking at the goofy stills of him. 
[02:53:00]  There's the one where he's sitting on the top of the Empire State Building just holding her.  If she was screaming and he could go, well, fuck you then, bitch, it's something.  Listen, but they're in love, and I don't want to see this big monster in love.  It's a fine blend.  Of what?  It's between those screaming scenes and the kind of love story-driven scenes that you're referring to. 
[02:53:30]  Now, when you left the theater, Kev, were other people crying?  Yes.  Were men crying?  I did not see a man crying.  What about Gangsta Fag?  Did he show emotion?  Did he finally show emotion?  I felt bad for Kong.  I put a gap in his mouth, had him suck on my dong.  Kong should have fucked that demon.  That would be a good barometer.  Was Gangsta Fag crying?  I didn't notice whether he was crying or not.  All right.  I don't know.  It seems like everyone is saying very emotional movie. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, it's going to be big.  I'm not against it.  Don't think I'm against it for any reason.  I'm like, don't go see it.  I just, for my personal, you know, my personal emotional level, I just can't.  I'm already sad at the trailers.  Just him.  And this whole, and even when he's fighting the T-Rexes, it's this whole, I love this white woman thing.  That fight is insane.  The T-Rex, it's like, okay, in the other movies, it's like, hold on, bitch, sit on this tree while I handle this, because this is what the fuck I do.  This one is like, oh my God, this shit, it's like Titanic, except for it's in the jungle. 
[02:54:30]  And it's, and he loved, and then at the end of it, and you know, it was made in 1933, so it's a metaphor for this is what happens when white women, and you know, metaphors about people, when white women and this big gorilla nigga, he falls in love no matter what the circumstances,  we're going to shoot your nigga ass off the top of a building, we know how it's going to end, we know how it's going to end, that's a metaphor for that, and I can't, I don't, it just bothers me.  Get off your high horse, the Empire State Building, get off up, you're feeling all high and mighty, uppity niggas, uppity niggas, up on top of that building with your white woman thinking you're safe, ivory tower kind of thing, and no, we got biplanes, here we come, we're going to shoot you down. 
[02:55:00]  Alright, Big Kev, what else you got on the movie, what?  I think, Patrice, I think you'll like it, I think, if you're available tomorrow at midnight, I'm doing a screening in Clifton, New Jersey at the Clifton Commons, I'll hold a seat for you.  A little pre-screening the day before the opening? 
[02:55:30]  If I go there, man, I know I'm not going to be, Kev, I'll call Kev, man, I might, I want to see it, but I'm telling you, even the fight, it's just already making me sad.  How many T-Rexes does he fight in that scene?  Three.  Three, the family.  You know, any other movie up till now, there's always been, like, one T-Rex, and T-Rex is, like, the motherfucker, and it's always one T-Rex.  Three of them.  He's fighting the family, the mom and the daddy and the little one.  Oh.  Yeah, that scene is crazy.  I hear it's great. 
[02:56:00]  I hear that Kong was dead throughout the whole movie, and...  Oh, you stopped it, that's the whole secret of the twist.  Yeah.  He was dead.  It was a dream sequence.  No, it's just another, it's just another fantastic leaps and bounds special effects.  Does he do anything mean, Big Kev?  Does he do anything that says he's angry?  And is it anything other than protecting her in fear?  Is it like, watch out, Kong will step on your face?  Did Jack Black die? 
[02:56:30]  Anything?  I don't, uh, mm, I don't, I don't want to say, I don't want to give too much away.  Okay, just say yes or no, did he do anything horribly?  Our old pal Jack Black.  Yeah, he'll be coming on our show again.  Did he do anything horribly?  Yeah, if you have to say there's a scale to things he did horrible and things you feel bad for him about, which way is it tip?  I'd say it's probably tipping towards the, you know, you feel horrible that he's in this situation and has to do these things. 
[02:57:00]  There's a couple of bad things.  Did he kill any of the guys that try to get her in the jungle?  Does he do anything horrible?  Didn't happen in the original.  Yeah.  He does?  Okay, good.  I'm going to say yeah on that.  In the remake in 1970, what, 76, right?  76.  He, he tossed, Kong was a motherfucker in that movie.  Yeah.  He just, he threw, he threw everybody into the ravine.  Everybody, except for, um, Fish and Chips, um, Willie, the, the, remember Live and Let Die, the guy with the hook on his arm? 
[02:57:30]  He was in, he was in King Kong, he lived to go say everybody, you know, but, you know, I just want to, I just don't, man, I, I know I'm being a pussy on this one, but it's just, I don't like, I never seen, I never seen it.  I just heard about it and I don't need to see it.  I don't need to see it.  All right.  Uh, Big Kev, anything else?  No, that's it.  Hey, Jack Black.  In Clifton, if you, uh, if you want to come to, uh, Midnight Show, Clifton Commons in Clifton, New Jersey.  I'm going to call you Big Kev, I'm going to call you Big Kev.  Hey, Kev, Kev, Jack Black doesn't do that over-the-top shit, Jack Black thing, does he? 
[02:58:00]  Because I was a little nervous when I heard Jack Black was in it, because he's good in some movies, but if he plays that whole over-the-top, I gotta be the center of attention, Jack Black, does he do that?  Well, there, there's an element to that, but there was an element to that in the original character as well.  So, I, I think it's, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's taking something that Jack Black is strong at and kind of focusing it into, you know, a serious, a more serious role. 
[02:58:30]  As long as it works.  Yeah, De Niro is almost being dark denim.  That Faye Ray was pretty hot for one of those oldie-time movie girls.  Oh, those oldie-time movies were sexy anyway.  I'm gonna go see.  They all look the same.  They all look like Miss Crabtree from Little Rascals.  The same hair, same fucking face, same clothes.  They all look like Miss Crabtree, who was also hot.  Hey, didn't you look up the review of the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, original movie?  Yeah, the New York Post, uh.  It stunk, right?  Do we have that anywhere?  Oh, it's in the Post today?  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  The Post had, uh, pretty much trashed the original.  And there's a smarmy guy, too.  Like, you wouldn't think it would be that smarmy in 1933?  The name of the reviewer was smarmy.  Yeah, like...  They retired his name, like, I don't know, 20, 30 years ago.  Damn, I was like...  No one has named this person's name anymore.  I could find it.  It's very close.  Page seven, eh.  Yeah.  But just to think that, uh...  Page seven.  Page seven of the Post.  Just to, uh, think the Post, you know, was around, still doing their shilling, their dirty business back then.  Is Big Kev still on the phone?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm still here. 
[02:59:30]  Narnia did stink, too, Kevin.  Okay.  I'm glad we agree on that.  Horrendous.  The guy's name...  They also put back, uh, uh, you're talking about the 1933.  There was that whole spider scene that they cut, and the footage is, uh, uh, long lost, unfortunately.  It was, it was deemed too horrific for audiences to see.  Back in 33.  Yeah.  Great.  They had seen, you know, gassings on the battlefields.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Because that nigga beat the spider.  They had him beating the spider.  You can't hear that nigga beating the spider. 
[03:00:00]  The spider represented the multiple legs of American commercialism, and there's no way  we're going to let that colored gentleman rip apart the United States of America.  You see who wrote this article about the old review?  Yeah.  Stephen Lynch.  Yeah, I saw that.  By Stephen Lynch.  Uh, the critic back in 1933 was Thornton Delhanty.  I'm Thornton Delhanty here with my review of King Kong.  The fast piano. 
[03:00:30]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  In fast motion.  Somebody, I parked my bike with the big wheel in the front right here.  Now, where is it?  Dateline.  New York City.  Big gorilla climbs the Empire State Building, and it stinks, and I don't like it.  My review from Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, Kong, even though it got panned, what did he say?  The critic said, its fantasy element has moments of humor, but its thrills are weakened by their  evident effort to be thrilling. 
[03:01:00]  What the fuck is he saying?  Audiences didn't agree.  Kong opened to sold-out crowds at both Radio City Music Hall and the RKO New Roxy.  Radio City Music Hall's sister theater in a rare simultaneous opening.  Yeah.  It made 1.1 million.  That was, that was, it was, it was in the top ten of that, that decade.  1.1 million.  That, the whole time.  The whole run?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One point.  Well, motherfucking.  Well, tickets were 35 cents.  Boys, where are they?  35 cents?  A nickel and a half.  It was a nickel.  It was, uh, they have tickets were 35 cents during the day, 75 cents at night. 
[03:01:30]  You, believe me, you were going to Radio City Music Hall.  That was probably, you know, a little more expensive than going to the local dive to go  see, uh, what else, what else was out in 33?  Uh, it was.  You probably know.  Uh, uh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Smuggins McGillicuddy and Harleen Johnson star in.  Harleen.  White, white women had black names back then.  Harleen.  Madeline Washington and. 
[03:02:00]  America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford, will star in our first talkie.  And here they are for the big premiere, rolling up to the red carpet.  They had Flash Gordon on the, uh, the, the, the, what do they call it?  The, uh, the, the, the thrill, the thrill, the, what do they call it?  Coming next week?  Yeah, the cereal.  The cereal and the shit back then, yeah.  Coming attractions.  Coming attractions.  And here comes the Cadillac with Fay Wray pulling up to the premiere of King Kong.  What a wonderful moment this is. 
[03:02:30]  I wonder if, Fay Wray, do you have a word you can say to the audience?  I love everybody and this is a fantastic legend and I find another motion picture.  Yes, we are, Fay.  It's going to be a wonderful motion picture.  Of course, the star of the movie, a big gorilla named King Kong.  Oh, my God.  He, he's caught on my foot.  I'm falling.  Come on.  Little Dickie Goodman, that parody.  I got you.  That's all they were back then, the newscasters.  Everything sounded the same.  Movie premiere.  We're here at the movie premiere.  It's the most exciting thing. 
[03:03:00]  The Hindenburg is crashed.  Oh, my God.  The humanity.  Mr. and Mrs.  War is over in Europe.  War is still raging in Japan.  This guy has the same delivery.  Mr. and Mrs. North America.  There's no dynamic to it.  To all of the ships at sea.  Flash.  Flash.  King Kong makes a record.  $4.66.  What an opening weekend in the tens of dollars.  We'll have it tabulated for you next month.  It's made $9.8.  The largest opening we've ever seen for a motion picture. 
[03:03:30]  Derby day from Canada.  Stop playing dumb, Anthony.  You were actually there, you fucking vampire.  Here comes Anthony Cumia, future shock jock.  What do you have to say, Anthony?  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  2006 vampire.  Anthony's the dude from The Seventh Sign who wants the world to end.  Oh, my God.  It's the tenth sign.  Thank God I can die. 
[03:04:00]  All right, Big Kev.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'm going to call you, Big Kev.  Give that plug again, Kev.  It's a midnight movie premiere of Kong.  It's tomorrow night, Tuesday night at midnight at the Clifton Commons, AMC Clifton Commons  in Clifton, New Jersey.  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  I have the all-time USA box office right now.  Let me take a guess.  First one, Titanic.  Very good.  The second one evidently would be Star Wars, the last Star Wars, right? 
[03:04:30]  No.  No.  Actually, it's Star Wars from 1977.  Oh, because they re-released it.  That's not fair, but we'll enjoy that.  The third one will be Star Wars again.  No.  No.  No.  Mm-mm.  Something new.  Lord of the Rings?  The past couple of years.  No.  Lord of the Rings came in at Return of the King, number eight.  U.S. box office.  This is U.S.  This is U.S.  With $377 million at number eight.  No, this number three made...  Yes. 
[03:05:00]  Shrek 2.  Very good.  Shrek 2 made...  How'd you pull that one out of your...  I'm a movie motherfucker.  I just watched these goofy movies.  Yeah.  Shrek 2 made a lot of money.  What about four?  Four.  Number four.  I have to keep saying Star Wars.  Star Wars...  No.  One of those Star Wars is in there, man.  Yeah, it is.  Top five.  Top five.  Okay.  So, it's number five.  Number four.  I don't know.  Give me a hint.  It goes back a couple of decades.  It goes back. 
[03:05:30]  Jaws.  Still four.  No.  E.T.  Four.  E.T.  Re-release or E.T.?  E.T.  E.T.  See, you got to think of the re-release.  Because they re-released it, yeah.  Yeah.  And that made about a good 90 million to re-release.  And we got, like, a number six, Spider-Man.  Spider-Man.  203.  The first one.  The first one.  I liked that movie.  The first one.  So, these are the top American, right?  American, yeah.  So, what happened?  So, the Worldwide doesn't even put them up with...  So, Lord of the Rings was bigger somewhere else than it was in the States.  Yeah.  Probably, like, England and shit.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:06:00]  Japan.  Well, see, that's that bullshit.  Once you throw Japan into it, you don't know what they're going to like.  That's really bullshit.  This is what counts.  It's weird over there.  This is what counts.  So, Lord of the Rings is not even up there.  So, they...  Number eight.  It's in the top ten.  And it's number 12.  And it's number 17.  The three of them.  But, see, Spider-Man 2...  Spider-Man cost $203 million to make.  So, it didn't even make...  It's $403 million domestic.  So, they only made its money back here.  So, here it's a flop.  It's a flop here.  Nah, because then you got...  $403 and Spider-Man. 
[03:06:30]  You got movie rentals, too, you know.  See, that's the bullshit.  Yeah, think of that shit.  TV, TV, TV, preview.  This is this thing that we're adding now, man.  This...  All of this...  That's something they didn't have years ago.  It's magic now.  It's all that magical stuff to make it seem like it's not bullshit.  Every movie's a hit now, if you look at everything they make with the DVDs and...  You want to see Kong?  They box it.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to have to see it.  As soon as it comes out.  I'm going to have to see it on the screen like that.  I don't know what I should do, though, to cover it up.  If I start weeping. 
[03:07:00]  I'm going to cry...  Bring Robert Kelly.  Bob Kelly, he'll stop it.  He'll be weeping way more than you, and no one will notice it.  I only got choked up at one movie in my life.  One movie, and the old classic listeners will know which one it is, but it was one fucking  part in one movie.  One part in one movie got me to go, like...  Like, make that...  I lost control of my diaphragm and sucked in out of nowhere, involuntary, and I was like, 
[03:07:30]  holy shit, what the fuck was that?  Schindler's List?  No.  I pardon you.  I was cracking up.  I don't remember the answer to this one.  You don't remember the answer?  Schindler's List.  Give us a hint.  It's a movie.  Goes back...  Was it late 80s?  Early 90s, maybe?  Not sure of the year.  It was very...  A love story kind of... 
[03:08:00]  Oh, boy.  Terms of endearment?  No, no.  Nothing like that.  But it was also a thriller type...  In the early 80s?  Supernaturally kind of thing.  Supernatural thriller kind of...  Romantic.  In early 80s, in late 80s.  Yeah.  Die Hard?  I was very emotional.  When Mr. Takagi got shot?  No.  You know what?  I think it was more when Hans Gruber was going, no, you're one of them.  No, don't shoot me. 
[03:08:30]  Don't kill me.  I so felt for him.  No.  Wow, I don't know.  Who stars it?  Who's a guest star?  Who's...  Oh, wow.  Let me see.  All right.  I'll give you a hint.  The guy was in it.  Nah, this will give it away, because...  The guy that was from...  A guy, a teacher from Fast Times at Ridgemont High was in it.  Sixth Sense?  Nope. 
[03:09:00]  There was only one teacher, Mr. uh...  Mr. Hand.  No.  Someone's asking if it's your wedding video.  So, uh...  Yeah, that'll do it.  Yeah, a bunch of people on Instant Feedback.  Well, at least a couple have gotten it.  And then finished it off with, you fag.  What is it, man?  You went to the opening night of Birth of a Nation.  Birth of a Nation.  That was it.  The premiere of Birth of a Nation.  That wasn't sad for...  That wasn't sad for...  That wasn't sad for...  Anthony, that was a...  No, that was a...  That was a comedy.  Yeah.  And here comes the Ku Klux Klan riding in as heroes. 
[03:09:30]  As those evil slaves...  Hunting them down.  For doing their evil...  I don't know, running away thing.  Their evil free work.  All right.  It's either The Crying Game...  No.  ...or Ghost.  Was it Ghost?  Fucking Ghost?  It was a scene in fucking Ghost.  What scene in Ghost?  One fucking...  Who was a teacher in Ghost?  The teacher in Ghost was, uh...  That teacher that took them all to the...  In Fast Times. 
[03:10:00]  The...  Oh, that dude.  Mr.  What was his name?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he took him down to the, uh...  To see the dead body.  He taught him how to...  He taught him how to kick nickels.  He's the guy on the...  Right, on the train.  Oh, okay, yeah.  I want to be a little obscure with the reference.  I don't want to see Patrick Swayze.  Oh, yeah.  He jumped through the train.  There's that goddamn stupid fucking scene  where Demi Moore's face is all lit up  and that one single tear...  I don't know how she does it.  It goes down her face.  And it was it.  I saw...  I just went like...  And then I was like...  No, I didn't put her... 
[03:10:30]  I saw Anthony at Ghost crying  and I fucked him in his ass  and I'm not lying.  Crying ass, bitch.  Fucking gangster fan.  Just like Demi Anthony was saying more, more.  I took that clay pot  and wrapped it around his face  and fucked him in his ass  until it...  I reached my arms around  and grabbed his dick like a spinning clay pot.  And Whoopi Goldberg watched 
[03:11:00]  and I punched that bitch  in her twat.  Wow.  No, it wasn't a, like, weeping.  It was one of those things  where you try to swallow or breathe  and you go like...  I cried more when Rick Avilis got killed.  Well...  You know, you put yourself out there.  No, that was it.  When you're sharing.  That was, like, the only movie  that ever did anything.  That's why I'm already sad at Kong. 
[03:11:30]  That's why I'm not gonna...  I never cried at a movie, ever.  Yeah.  Never.  You don't think Titanic was sad  at the end  when the old broad came back  and they were back on the stairway?  Absolutely.  Because I remember leaving the theater  right after that scene.  Yeah.  You would think  you were leaving a fucking funeral.  A funeral.  We saw that one, Ope.  Which one?  Titanic, when it was in the movie theater.  Remember, we all went...  I ruined that movie for...  My girl was watching it.  She's seen it 25,000 times.  So I'm watching it with her  and I'm just making fun 
[03:12:00]  of this stupid movie.  It just...  Titanic did nothing.  Jack!  Human trauma,  it just...  It doesn't...  With the animals.  Ben's raw ass.  Ben?  Hey, you know,  before you even said that,  you know, my guess  was that it was, uh,  Gone with the Wind  when you were watching it  with Groucho, you know?  I didn't watch  Gone with the Wind  with Groucho.  I met Groucho.  Patricio.  All right.  Thank you.  You should never have  admitted to that.  What a faggot.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:12:30]  Faggot.  Faggot.  Yeah, that was one.  You should have said something.  You should have said  fuck or something.  Let me ask you something.  You should have said  gangsta fag made you cry.  In hindsight,  I will admit,  it looks bad.  When the movie  first came out,  and it was like  that one scene,  it's totally acceptable  to me.  And I have no qualms  or problems  with saying it,  and I have no,  uh, uh,  it's no threat  to my masculinity,  me admitting that,  that it was a moment  in time.  There were some tough 
[03:13:00]  scenes to get through,  uh, in Bridges  of Madison County,  I guess.  Yeah, when, uh,  Clint Eastwood had his  shirt off at the pump well.  Watching that fossil  without his shirt on.  Well, you know,  I felt bad for,  there's a few things  I felt bad.  I felt bad when I thought  Little Nemo was almost  going to be hurt.  You motherfucker,  Little Nemo.  Little Nemo almost  got hurt,  and it was weird.  I said,  oh, don't die,  Little Nemo,  you got a bad fin.  What about Mufasa  in The Lion King?  Very sad.  Matter of fact,  I've never seen  The Lion King  because of that. 
[03:13:30]  I don't want to see that.  You have never seen  The Lion King?  I'm going to tell you  us little Simba  when he's trying  to talk to his  dead father.  Come on, Dad.  Nope.  Come on.  Couldn't watch it.  I know about it.  I just couldn't.  Why?  Because I don't like  animal stuff.  Don't fucking,  don't fucking fuck  with me with the  animal shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay, put it,  okay,  I almost had a little  thing with City of Angels.  City of Angels.  With Nick,  Nick,  Nicholas Cage 
[03:14:00]  and Meg Ryan.  almost got a little  teared up  when she got hit  by the car.  You never,  never got a little  misty at a movie?  Not,  not,  Platoon.  Platoon,  which scene?  William Dafoe's scene.  That was a,  that was a hardcore scene,  man.  Oh,  when he gets it?  When he did the  in the air thing,  that was,  you know,  shooting,  that scene  in that movie  that made me very sad,  can't watch too many times,  is when Kevin Dillon  shoots at the pig.  The pig gets up. 
[03:14:30]  There's a fucking  old boy.  Jesus,  what's wrong with him?  I don't know  when he fucking  gun butted  that little retard,  did nothing for him.  Dance.  He's laughing at you.  That's how the gook  laughs at you.  Do it for Manny  and Sal.  That's how the fucking  gook laughs at you.  Dance.  Oh,  my God.  Here's a,  this scene  did nothing for you? 
[03:15:00]  That is  fan-fucking-passing.  It's the greatest.  When that old broad  is just  jabber-jibber-jabbering  and he fucking  pops a square  in the head.  But they don't have  one now.  You don't have one now  where Barringer goes  to Johnny Depp  what she's fucking  saying.  Yeah.  He's saying something  about you coming  in here,  you fucking  with their rice. 
[03:15:30]  Just pops her  in the head  and he's right  back to business.  But they forget  they shoved Manny's  dick in his mouth  against the tree.  He got a ticket.  Come on, man.  That's it.  There's some sad  shit in that,  but it's just like  Titanic.  Titanic.  No.  No, true love.  Not even when he  sunk down in the water.  When he sunk down  in the water,  my first feeling  was,  ooh, that's creepy.  I wouldn't want  to be that, motherfucker.  That is eerie.  All right, let's  go to Rob  on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, the scene  that got me in Titanic 
[03:16:00]  wasn't like her  at the end on the boat  or him sinking.  It was when they  were coming back  for the bodies  and you see that woman  in the water  holding her frozen baby.  And it's just like,  I don't know,  I did that breathing  thing that Anthony did  where I was just like,  I wasn't going to  let myself cry,  but that one.  Yeah, it's one of those  where you just kind of  hold back  and you go kind of,  and you get that  little juggle thing  goes,  you throw it,  you can't swallow.  It sounds like,  it seems like if you swallow  it's going to be  the whole theater will hear it  like,  oh,  you get, 
[03:16:30]  oh, this guy,  Adam's got a good one.  Which one?  Saving Private Ryan  at the end  when he's saluting the flag.  Any old veteran thing.  Done.  You ever watch  Band of Brothers?  Watch the series  Band of Brothers?  Excellent fucking thing.  If you're looking  to get someone  a war buff,  a series on DVD  for Christmas,  Band of Brothers.  It's amazing.  At the end,  they have the actual guys  from,  that were the Band of Brothers.  They're all obviously 
[03:17:00]  old guys  and they're talking  about their experiences.  and you just see them  like,  they'll be talking,  yeah,  Bobby,  I remember Bobby,  a young Italian guy  that we had gotten  off the boats.  I really can't talk  about this right now.  And you go like,  it is so hard  to fucking watch.  Just your impression,  I think I got a little more.  They do. 
[03:17:30]  They're talking about  these guys  like it was yesterday  and they were  in this experience  together that  no one could  ever imagine.  And then,  like,  he's dead.  This guy's still alive  and he's all old  and he's got the memories  of him as a young kid  and he'll be talking  and laughing  about something  and a memory  will click in his head  and these big,  old,  blue eyes.  And he's the actual guy.  Yeah.  That doesn't count.  You're insane.  The actual people  don't count.  Only movies count.  Movie scenes  that an actor did 
[03:18:00]  that made you cry.  Maybe,  maybe when Don Corleone  dropped in the tomato patch.  That was funny.  No real people count.  You're spilling it.  No real people,  no real stuff  can count, man.  Damn,  Anthony's crying  all over his apartment,  though.  What?  No, no, no.  He's going through  boxing and tissues.  No,  that didn't make me cry,  but it gets you,  like,  where you're like,  this is some sad  fucking shit.  Anthony, 
[03:18:30]  did this picture  on the post,  the front cover  of the post,  that's been getting  the truth.  It's making me mad.  It's making me cry.  You cry over  Grey Wolf song.  Hold on.  And a lot of people  want to comment  on the instant feedback.  Did you cry  during Jerry Maguire 2?  And then he describes  the part where  Anthony cried.  You had me at hello.  Cut to Anthony  watching on his couch.  No.  All right,  well,  here you go.  Assholes.  Prince in D.C.,  what's up? 
[03:19:00]  It's Rich.  I'm sorry, Rich.  What's up?  Anthony,  I want to know  if you cried  on Milo and Otis  when they got separated.  See,  I never saw Milo and Otis.  You never saw Milo and Otis.  Animals.  Because that or the bear.  All right,  we get it.  You hate animals.  Yes.  I mean,  you love animals.  You love animals.  Give me some human.  All right,  we get it.  Give me a sad human one  that maybe I see  Chris in Jersey.  What's up?  Yeah,  I want to know  if Anthony cried  at the end  in Howard the Duck  when Leah Thompson  was a animal.  I didn't even hear  the rest of you guys. 
[03:19:30]  How about the Princess Bride?  Was there anything  that you said?  Oh,  very,  very touching.  No.  No.  Anthony,  you're not alone.  Let's go to  a guy named Memphis  in New Jersey.  He's confused.  Memphis,  what's up?  No,  it's a girl.  Oh.  Stripper name?  I'm sorry?  Stripper name?  I guess my mom  wanted me to be,  but I'm not.  Memphis.  All right,  Memphis,  what's up?  No,  Patrice is trying  to act all tough.  I just wanted to know  if he cried  at Braveheart.  Every guy cried  at Braveheart. 
[03:20:00]  When he got chopped up?  Are you fucking kidding me?  He yells freedom  at the end there.  He yells freedom?  Oh, shit.  I'll tell you one thing  about me.  I'll give you  an emotional scene  but not that feel worthy.  There are too many  white people  going through stuff,  movies,  that I've ever cried.  I might have almost  cried at Color Purple.  But, but...  Oh, okay.  We watched that  the other day  and my girlfriend  says,  she goes,  there's like five scenes  in this  where she cries.  It did.  And there.  And there was.  You can see  it's very emotional  and stuff.  If they were white people,  I would have cried. 
[03:20:30]  I'm a star.  I really care.  And Billy Bird  fucked up that cry for me.  I'm a star.  I'm going to tell you.  I'm going to die.  Ready?  He goes,  in the movie,  I was very sad  because he goes,  give us free, right?  And Billy goes,  that motherfucking  sounds like  the cookie monster.  Give us cookie.  And I ruined it.  He fucked up my cry.  Cooked you out of it.  But, oh,  like the Cinderella man,  I don't give a shit about it.  He got shot freedom.  Well, when the sisters  at the end  of the Color Purple  come running together  in the field.  When they find each other,  man, that's some shit.  That's, you know,  black family shit.  That sure didn't make 
[03:21:00]  black men look good.  Not a good light  on the black man.  What about Rudy?  You cry during Rudy?  Oh, not at all.  Not a tear.  Not a joke.  Not at all.  Sorry.  Not a joke.  We got some more  calling in here.  Ken in Ohio.  Ken?  Yeah, man.  I wanted to know  if he cried  watching The Champ.  The Champ.  No.  Wasn't that a killer?  The remake?  I don't know  about Ricky Schroeder, man.  That is the remake.  The original had like,  the original was actually,  the kid was played  by the guy  that plays Uncle Fester. 
[03:21:30]  Jesus.  He was a child actor.  Wow.  And he was cute  as a little button  back then.  What about when  the old man and woman  in Titanic  got dressed up  and just laid in bed  while everybody else  was dressed up?  I thought that was hysterical.  That was very sad.  No, I loved it.  That was sad, dude.  You know what?  It got me thinking too much.  I was sitting there thinking,  what are they going to do?  Lay there and take a breath?  Suspension of disbelief.  Like, it's going to get  to the point where  that water gets up  and you're going to get  out of that fucking bed  and go, ah!  Yeah, they're just going  to lay there  hugging each other  romantic and shit.  Underwater.  You know that's a 
[03:22:00]  Get your old ass  up and turn it.  You know that turned  into a horrific death  when they went  to the next scene, man.  They tried to romanticize  that shit.  Them flying to get out of it.  There was no peace  and then they both  made a deal  to take a deep breath  and one say,  you know what?  There was no peaceful death.  All right, you know  what else is a little sad?  That was horrific.  Them crawling at the ceiling  trying to get some air.  That was a little sad.  Stupid fucking...  Always a piece of shit.  What did you cry at?  We didn't get nothing  until you almost crying at.  There was some things, what?  You ever see Downfall?  Eric just played him out. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, we'll turn him in  in a second.  Downfall when Hitler  had to take the cyanide pill  and put it in his  German shepherd's mouth  and click it to kill his dogs  before he killed himself.  Oh.  And he's attached to his dog  and I know it's Hitler and all  but it's just the guy  and his dog.  That kind of made me  feel a little bad.  As he kicked a Jew.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  I said that on the air  when I first saw the movie  and people were like,  are you insane?  I don't know if I burned up Jews  but he lost his dog.  I know it's Hitler. 
[03:23:00]  He saved his pet ship  and his dog.  And you know something?  He did his own dog.  He didn't have  one of his other guys do it.  He was, you know,  gave the dog the cyanide,  clamped down.  And done.  John.  And then Hitler  kind of walked away  with his arms behind his back  feeling all bad about it.  John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, boys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  Look at him like I'm crazy.  I know.  Yes, sir.  That movie, Rudy,  gets me every time.  I think I had a little moisture  during Rudy. 
[03:23:30]  A little bit, a little bit.  Near the end of the movie there?  That quarterback,  it's all worth it.  Everything you went through.  There you go.  Glory when Denzel  picks up the flag.  God damn it.  Glory.  That's a good movie.  Glory has two.  Denzel's one tier.  Yeah.  That one tier.  That single tier thing.  There's something about it.  That's the greatest.  They know how to get it.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Yeah, I actually have two.  Tell me you didn't cry  at the end of Field of Dreams  when he's playing catch  with his dad.  That was pretty cool.  Nah, nah.  That had a little  something to it. 
[03:24:00]  No?  And the other one  is Brian's song.  Tell me you didn't cry  when he went.  Back in the day,  Brian's song.  Yeah.  I love Brian Piccolo.  And I want you  to love him too.  Brian's song is,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  yeah,  it's there,  but it's not enough  to make a man cry.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, uh,  did you cry  when Bubba got killed  in Forrest Gump, man?  The big lip retard, man. 
[03:24:30]  He didn't know  what was going on.  What was he even doing, man?  I got shot,  Forrest.  He'd something bit me.  I can't deal with that, dude.  All right, good.  I was in the theater  watching it,  but luckily there was  a chick with me,  so it all worked out.  There you go.  All right, fellas.  What'd you cry out,  the sweeto?  A few of those  were mentioned, Rudy.  Some of the craziness  of Sixth Sense  got me a little bit.  So what's the,  what's the end of Gladiator? 
[03:25:00]  All right,  what's the thing  that taps,  that taps,  what's the part of you  that's being tapped?  There's no, like,  all out crying or anything.  I know you're not weeping,  but what's the thing  where you just get a little,  what is that,  what is the tapping  into Rudy?  Because Rudy,  like, some,  this thing,  like, the guy goes,  feel the dreams,  he's catching it with his dad.  I'm not trying to be,  like, stereotypical.  I don't know my father.  That shit gets me nowhere.  Or anything with a,  with a, you know,  the soul food  and the whole family thing.  I didn't have all that  to relate to it.  Yeah.  So what is it about Rudy  that you relate to 
[03:25:30]  and you go,  wow, that is sad.  Rudy didn't do anything  for me.  Well,  he worked his ass off  and he finally got a chance  to prove himself.  Underdog.  I think it's any time,  any time,  underdog shit.  Whether you're crying  or not.  Underdog shit, right.  Whether you're blubbering,  crying or not.  Whether,  or you're just like,  feeling like an emotion  welling up or something.  It's just when an actor  can really convey  a strong emotion  on screen.  Yeah.  That's what'll do it.  Whether it's love 
[03:26:00]  or,  or some kind of  reunion  thing like that.  Any,  any kind of shit  like that  will get you.  Yeah.  Yeah,  I got another one.  But they gotta be good.  How about when Ajax  gets caught in the Warriors?  Now that,  you know,  I was welling up,  like,  just wanted to rape the bitch  and,  what did they leave below?  Ajax.  I got another one.  48 hours,  he was great as Gans.  Nice gun.  I got another one  in the notebook  when she realizes  that the man next to her  is her husband. 
[03:26:30]  Which one?  That was pretty tough.  There's some movies  that you're a fan.  That's a bad one.  But you were saying  that you saw  The Notebook,  The Notebook.  That was Devin  when I made some feedback.  All right,  we want to get to  a couple other things  before we get out of here.  Boy,  we went from fag to fag here,  didn't we?  Gangsta fag,  a crying movie.  Jesus Christ,  crying and shit.  Gangsta fag is listening  going,  what the fuck is this fag  is doing?  These guys are pussies.  Gangsta fag  will make you cry.  Gangsta fag  will blow some nut  in your eye. 
[03:27:00]  Gangsta fag  is going,  that scene  in American Me  when they fucked  that guy in the butt  with the butt knife.  That was fucked up,  yo.  Because I was dead.  All right,  we're going to go  to the other side  of this thing  we call radio,  I guess.  We don't need to talk  about Shaq the cop.  That's just a joke thing.  Who cares?  Like he's actually  going to be on patrol  doing his thing.  Stop it.  Five-year-old girl  who feels no pain.  Have you seen  this girl yet? 
[03:27:30]  No.  She feels no pain  whatsoever.  They interviewed her  on Good Morning America.  Listen to this.  She seemed so perfect.  Such a good little girl  and she was.  Yeah.  At a few days old though,  Gabby slept  through the prick  of a blood test  and in the morning  she'd be in her crib  quiet  but freezing cold  to the touch.  Very cold.  Amazingly cold.  But then  she'd wake right up  and be happy  and I just remember that.  It turns out  she didn't react  to the pain  of a needle 
[03:28:00]  or the cold  because she couldn't  feel it.  Pain teaches.  Pain protects.  Pain can save you  from a lot of  bad things in life.  What seems at first  blush like a gift  is in fact  a devastating disability.  Every childhood  milestone  has become  a new danger  instead of a joy.  She started  cutting teeth  and she had bit  down through her skin.  She would have bit  down to the bone  had I let her.  It was just  chewed up.  We decided  to pull her teeth  because she was  mutilating her fingers. 
[03:28:30]  Whoa!  I didn't see  that coming.  We pulled her teeth.  Didn't even have  to take her to her dentist.  She doesn't feel anything.  We just went out  back with the pliers.  She's going to make  a great girlfriend.  As soon as she gets  old enough.  Through most of that clip  I was just sitting there  going so, so.  She's not feeling the pain  so what's the big deal?  She's not feeling it so.  When she's 22.  Sweetie, I'm fisting you  right now.  Yeah, you don't even know it.  How's that feel?  What?  How does what feel?  It must feel great.  I don't know.  I'm just paying  some bills here. 
[03:29:00]  Don't even know.  Let's go to the end  of the clip again.  Teeth and she had bit  down through her skin.  She would have bit  down to the bone  had I let her.  It was just chewed up.  We decided to pull  her teeth because  she was mutilating  her fingers.  Yeah.  Yeah, he says  it so casually.  So.  I'm mutilating.  Yeah, I've had  to pull the teeth.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a hell  of an affliction.  Yeah, some people  got, you can die  from that.  Some people, you just  die.  It gets worse.  I don't know.  And learning to walk 
[03:29:30]  just made her more  vulnerable.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  By the time Gabby  was two and a half,  she had been  hospitalized and  been injured  multiple times.  And her little eyes  were especially at risk.  You'd look away  for one second and  you'd look back and  she'd have her finger  in her eye.  You're watching a  child go blind  right in front of you.  Her desperate parents  tried restraints.  It was horrible.  It felt like you  were torturing your  child.  And they tried  goggles.  But by the time  Gabby was four,  she needed to have  her left eye removed. 
[03:30:00]  The day the tiny  Holy shit.  Stop it.  We really need this  with our morning coffee.  What?  You're just trying  to take a peek  at TV before  you head out the door.  Wait, she would  just pick at her  eyeball until it  had to come out?  Because it didn't  hurt?  Like normally  you just touch  your eye and  you know.  It would freak  you out.  Your body tells  you don't do  that.  You would barely  be able to  touch your  own eyeball.  Dr. Than  is in the  studio.  Dr. Than  what more  info could  you give us  on this? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, she  would just  scratch, you  know, if she  felt an itch,  she would scratch  it.  Like when you  have an itchy  eye, you shut  your eye and  then kind of  rub it.  And use your  finger, yeah.  She would just  keep it open and  scratch her eyeball?  She's like an  X-Files mutant  with no talent.  It just, there's  no way anything  she does can  help.  I am feel no  pain person.  I just  fucked myself up.  killer.  They are slowly.  Yeah, they're  just dismantling  her teeth and  eyeballs and  fingers, you 
[03:31:00]  know what I'm  saying?  It's just like,  just poor  moment.  We had to.  Let's see what  else is going  on here with  her.  Shoot her,  sweetie, we  just shot  you.  But by the  time Gabby  was four, she  needed to have  her left eye  removed.  Today, the  tiniest actions  pose huge  threats.  Oh, you  okay,  fucking?  Playing  with the dog.  Don't let  her.  We've told  her that's good  for her.  Wait, was  that an  owl?  They just  explain it,  I was happy  for her.  She got an  owl.  Like she  felt  something.  Oh. 
[03:31:30]  Ow.  We've told  her that it's  good for her  to say  ow because  it lets  people know  she's bumped  or hit  something.  Challenges  that Gabby's  parents know  they'll have  to face  for a lifetime.  We've met  families that  have lost  their kids.  So at the  same time,  so what if  our kid is  blind?  So what if  she ends up  in a wheelchair?  We can hold  her, we can  love her, we'll  do everything  Oh, I love  that no tooth  one-eyed bitch.  You can also  do that with  a kitten.  That no tooth 
[03:32:00]  one-eyed bitch  with no pain?  No pain  feeling, chewed  fingered,  fucking dog  bitten.  Everybody wants  to know if  you're sobbing  while listening  to this,  Anthony.  Yeah, I always  get a little  misty, I gotta  be honest with  you.  Assholes.  Oh, what a  great movie that  would be.  Oh, I'm sure  it'll make a  lifetime exclusive.  Helen Keller  and we got  audio of her  as an adult  trying to walk.  Would you like  to hear it?  Yeah, let's  say it.  Oh, good lord.  We told her to  say, oh, dear  lord, when she  falls. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, good lord.  Or good lord.  There's an argument  going on.  Oh, good lord.  No, and it's not  a lifetime that  they're going to  have to do this  until she gets  old enough to  realize you can't  scratch your own  fucking eyeball  and tell her  when you get  a baby out of  body parts.  What did I do?  Let's say hi to  Craig in Cleveland.  Craig, what's up?  I was going to  say this chick  sounds like she's  the start of a  new supervillain.  Yeah, but no  power whatsoever to  do anything.  No power.  The power to get  fucked up and not 
[03:33:00]  feel it.  Great.  Back to the  workshop on that  one.  We got one more  clip.  I don't think  Stan Lee's pissed  off he missed  that one.  No pain girl.  No pain girl.  Crumbles it up  throws it away.  So there's some  disconnect between  the brain and  the fingers and  every other part  of her body,  right?  Exactly.  Like Trish said,  she has a sense  of touch, but  somewhere between  touch and where  we would feel pain,  the threshold on  her is extremely  high or non-existent. 
[03:33:30]  I'm not a doctor,  but there's just  some neuron or  something that  doesn't.  The way it was  explained to us  is that each nerve  fiber is three  nerves, one's for  touch, one's for  motion, and a  separate nerve for  pain, and in that  nerve, there's a  disconnect, the  pain signal, even  though the finger  might be saying  ouch, the brain  never hears it.  My one for  emotion is very  sensitive.  It must be what  it is, that I  well up and  tear up.  First thing I do  is my son, I  sell him to the 
[03:34:00]  highest bidder.  He can really  take a hit.  My son will  not feel, just  check him after  every game, check  his feet, make  sure his toe ain't  gone, make sure  his eyeball ain't  stuck.  Get that  nigga some big  gloves so he  can't scratch his  eyeball.  Send him out, put  him in coach.  But she has the  itch nerve.  Yeah, she can  feel itch, and  she can feel  touch, which is  weird.  And they're  taking away body  parts, and the  listeners are  trying to figure  it out now.  So they took  the teeth out  because she was  biting through  her lips and  stuff, right?  And chewing on 
[03:34:30]  her fingers.  And chewing on  her fingers.  So they took  her eye out  because she's  using her fingers.  Scratched her  eye.  Scratched her  damaged her.  So she has  one eye left, so  Chris has  something here.  Chris in  Pennsylvania.  Hey, they  should just  take off the  rest of her  fingers and  save that  last eye.  Yeah, what  do you do?  You gotta  sacrifice the  fingertips to  save the eye.  To save the  eye.  They're so  fucking stupid.  Just take  off a hat.  This is what  you do.  You snip off  anybody else  whose kids  have to scratch 
[03:35:00]  their eyeball  because they  don't have  paint.  Take the  snips off of  two adult  gloves and  tape them to  scratch the  finger eye.  Or scratch  the eye  finger.  And then  the eyeball  part of it  or the teeth  part.  Put a mouthpiece  in the  fucking kid's  mouth.  So she's  wearing a  mouthpiece  and glove  fingers.  A mouthpiece  and a glove  finger.  That's it.  She should  get into  ultimate  fighting.  Go up  against  these  Tukey  Williams  type of  guys.  What the  fuck?  This chick  could take 
[03:35:30]  a punch.  Guatemalans  got her in  some hold  where the  arm is  twisted around  the back  and she's  just fucking  like, you  quit.  Show me  what you  got.  Say you  give.  Give.  You  give.  Uh-uh.  All right.  Mark in  North Carolina.  Hey, how  you doing  O&A?  All right.  I was  going to  say I  probably  go to  hell for  saying this  one.  She could  probably  grow up to  be the  next anal  porn queen.  Oh, wow.  Funny show  this morning,  guys.  Been laughing  all morning. 
[03:36:00]  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you,  sir.  So there  you go.  A little  audio that  Nathaniel found  this morning.  No eye,  no fucking  teeth.  That's pretty  fucked up.  It should be  something they  could do.  They rushed  to judgment  on that.  They just  rushed to  judgment and  left the  parents responsible  for a little  too much.  I think there  should have  been more  doctors involved  in what they  should do.  What do we  do?  Pull her  teeth out.  We just  let her walk  around and  scratch her  eyeball out of  her head.  Maybe they  should have  been watching  constantly. 
[03:36:30]  How about  you pin her  down all  the time?  Restrain her  all the time  and feed her  and then you  get her up  to exercise  and you  Velcro her  hands to  her sides  and make  her run  around the  yard like  that with  like bumper  like boating  bumpers around  her body.  With a stick  in the middle  like one of  those soccer  ball things  that you're  hitting and  spins around  the stick.  Right,  right.  She just  runs around  in a circle  and it's  just it.  There are  plenty of  ways.  These parents  were lazy.  I was going  to say you  got to start  looking at the  parents.  All they have  to do is keep 
[03:37:00]  yourself  until she's  what?  For a few  years  we can smack  around and  say 10,  10,  9,  and say  don't scratch  your eyeball  out.  Taking her  eye out?  Mommy,  my eye is  itching.  Well,  we're going  to take  it out.  Don't  scratch it.  We're going  to take  out your  eye?  Holy shit.  All right,  well,  we've got to  go there.  Chester's  liver from  whackbag.com.  God forbid  this girl  hits puberty  and starts  fingering herself.  God only  knows what  her parents  will take  out next.  Oh, 
[03:37:30]  no.  She doesn't  feel pain.  It could  look like  that scene  from Poltergeist  with the  technician  in the  mirror.  What  happened to  my pussy?  You've got to  think you  still have  the instinct  to fool  around with  yourself.  The damage  she's doing.  Oh,  that poor  thing.  See,  there you  go.  That's  sad.  And here's  somebody else.  No cramps  though,  girls.  How about  that?  A little  envious  now,  I bet  you.  Texas,  what's  up?  Hey,  what's  going  on, 
[03:38:00]  guys?  Hey,  man.  I saw  something on  TV about  that girl  a couple  weeks ago.  She can't  actually feel  when she  has to go  to the  restroom  either.  So she,  that's another  thing that's  wrong with  her.  Now she's  hot again.  She's  millions of  dollars.  Her parents  are fucking  up the  future  money  that she  has  coming  to  her.  Yeah.  She's  peas at  will.  She can  take  anything.  Let's go to  Jack in  Jersey.  Jack?  Hey,  big deal.  Every  Saturday  night,  I'm just  like that  little girl 
[03:38:30]  when I  drink too  much  Jägermeister.  you wake  up,  you've  chewed  your  fingers  off  and  shoved  them  in  your  eyeball.  Let's  go to  Kevin in  Baltimore.  Kevin?  Yeah,  this is  Kevin.  Yeah,  we know.  Let's go to  Kevin in  Baltimore,  you  stuttering  muttering  prick.  I was  wondering  how the  heck  they  disciplined  her.  It's like  you can  really  spank  her or  anything  like  that.  Cut  a  pick  eye  out.  Yeah,  obviously  they know  how to  punish.  She's  scratching  just a  hole.  She's  mad  as a  moment. 
[03:39:00]  Boxing  gloves  and  hockey  helmets?  Yeah,  dick,  yeah.  What are  you going  to do?  You've got  boxing  gloves  and a  hockey  helmet  on.  You  can't  touch  shit.  Oh my  God,  that's  the  end  of  the  show.  That  went  very  quickly  today.  Mr.  H,  what's  up?  Hey,  will she  say  our  cry  out  when  Patrice  shoves  that  big  glass  butt  plug  up  her  ass?  All right,  Mike in  Boston.  What's  up,  Mike?  Yeah,  you guys  talking  about  that  girl  being  like  a  fucking  villain  or  something?  Yeah.  Yeah,  there was  a villain  like that  in one  of the 
[03:39:30]  new  James  Bond  movies  with  Kelly Sheen's  wife.  And it  sucked.  Who the  hell is  still  watching  James  Bond  movies?  Me.  I got  a new  one.  I gave  up on  that  series.  The  Layak  when the  fucking  Cold War  ended.  The  Lay  cake  guy  is  the  new  one.  Mario  in  Brooklyn.  Mario  up,  boys,  Patrice  rules.  Upside  down  lampshade  around  the  neck  like  a  dog.  There  you go. 
[03:40:00]  We got  a solution.  See?  Pones  around  the  neck.  We solved  the problem  today on  the damn  show.  You remember  who recommended  Layer Cake  by the way  on this  show first?  Yes,  I do.  Laughed at  her.  Francine.  Francine.  No,  she was  confused by  it though.  She thought  there was  too much  going on  or  something.  I thought  she said  it was  a good  movie.  Did  she?  I'm not  sure.  We're  going to  have to  ask her  time.  Tom  in  Jersey,  what's  up?  Fucking  dummy.  Hello,  man.  It's the first  time I've  listened to you  guys since  you got off  1027.  Thank you,  sir.  I'll let you  know you  guys,  you still suck,  man. 
[03:40:30]  Thank you,  my friend.  Is that good  or bad?  I don't even  know.  Oh,  man,  I've listened  to you guys  in a while.  He's fucking  awesome.  Take care.  Thank you,  Tom.  You know how  much that  sucks?  He was a  huge fan  when we  were on  regular  radio.  This is  the first  day he's  listening to  us.  The first  fucking  day.  I stopped  watching James  Bond when I  started welling  up and cried  when Oddjob got  killed,  grabbing his hat  and getting  shot.  I got a  little misty,  the big fella.  I didn't  get to that  big gook.  Why are they 
[03:41:00]  hurting Bob  Kelly?  All right,  Patricia,  Neil,  thanks.  We'll see  you tomorrow,  guys.  That's it.  I'm out of  here. </pre>
