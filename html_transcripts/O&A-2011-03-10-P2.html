<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show Live broadcast opens with Sam Roberts and the O&A crew reflecting on the show's transition to SiriusXM, discussing its evolution since the move.  A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to a recounting—including played audio—of a past incident where Opie poured mustard on a toothpick sculptor guest after Anthony had already stolen the guest's portfolio. The ensuing chaos, involving the team's attempts to evade the enraged artist and offer apologies, is described in detail.

The discussion then shifts to the upcoming Roland's Pizza Party, highlighting its unplanned expansion from a small morale booster into a massive, unwieldy event.  The hosts elaborate on the unexpected guest list, revealing a surprise attendee: Kevin Cristiano from Project Runway, who was mistakenly booked by Roland for the party instead of a live Opie and Anthony appearance.

A significant segment plays audio of a previous encounter between former Ron and Fez producer Eastside Dave and Guns N' Roses' Stephen Adler. The audio captures Eastside Dave’s passionate, somewhat erratic meeting with Adler, featuring singing and discussions about drummers.  Eastside Dave subsequently calls into the show, providing further details of the encounter, including a rather embarrassing admission: he experienced an accidental bowel movement during his intense interaction with Adler.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. This is After ONA Live. Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. I'm Sam Roberts. Opie and Anthony, well, they stayed here until about 10.05, so to say that they left in a hurry would be an understatement.  But the rest of us are still here. D-Boy's back today. Danny's here. Travis, E-Rock, Troy, everybody. We're all hanging out.  And we keep the channel live because, why not? It's something nice for you. It's something nice for us. 
[00:00:30]  It's Pizza Party Day, so we're all very excited here as the studio is getting cleaned up.  One of the Ron and Fez interns is in here right now trying to set up the Ron and Fez stuff.  They're coming up after ONA Live, but after Opie and Anthony Live.  But we still have a lot of stuff to cover today. Of course it is. We'll get into the Pizza Party stuff in a little bit here on the show.  But, I mean, everybody who works here is talking about this pizza party. 
[00:01:00]  But first, something came up in the beginning of the show today about the guys, the unpredictability of every day being gone from the show since they got to Sirius.  And Opie and Anthony, or the Sirius building, Opie and Anthony started talking about, did you drop something over there, Gabe? What happened?  Yes, I dropped the Pal Talk headphones.  Well, Ron's not going to be happy about that, is he?  No, I will probably get a cowbell thrown at me.  That's Ron and Fez intern Gabe. You dropped something else. 
[00:01:30]  I'm a mess today, Sam.  Well, don't worry about it.  But, yes, so they said the unpredictability was gone from the show.  And when we were over on 57th Street, you never knew what was going to happen.  Of course, an example was cited of Opie going to the window and pouring mustard on a guy who worked in the building.  Basically, one day, E-Rock, you found this guy, right?  Yeah, I had to run over to the Dwayne Reed across the street, and there was this guy bragging that he was going on Letterman because he makes toothpick sculptures. 
[00:02:00]  And he had these portraits that were literally celebrities or whoever they were, and it was a full facial portrait, and it was on a black card made of toothpicks.  Yeah, he had that, and he also had, I think he had a Statue of Liberty or Empire State Building with him as well.  Oh, right, a full sculpture of it.  So E-Rock, doing what he does for the show, said, hey, why don't you come up and be on a radio show? 
[00:02:30]  So he brought this guy up.  We had no idea what to do with him.  We ended up talking to him for, I mean, how long did we actually talk to him for?  Just about an hour.  That's what I thought, because we were trying to figure out a way to get the sculptures so we could break them.  Eventually, we just had him leave the studio because we were done with it.  At one point, we walked out of the room completely.  Ralphie May was in the studio that day.  He didn't quite get what was going on, so we just left Ralphie May in there with him. 
[00:03:00]  Well, that was the second time.  What do you mean the second time?  The first time, Anthony was tired of all this boring bullshit and just grabbed his portfolio and ran into Poe's office with the guy chasing him.  I love what's going on in here.  Mars is working on the phones.  Is there anything really wrong or just a typical thing?  Just a typical thing.  We're good.  All right.  So the guy ends up leaving.  Opie is obsessed with doing something to his artwork. 
[00:03:30]  So he tries to pour mustard.  Is that kind of where we're picking up this clip?  Well, yeah.  The guy had, after Anthony had stolen his portfolio, the guy had left.  He was really upset.  And Opie just had the idea of he's going to take Jimmy's mustard and then run to the windows and try to spray him with mustard from the fifth floor.  I will never forget.  I was on the sidewalk when this happened because I wanted to see it actually go down.  I ran down the stairs to beat this guy down the elevator.  It was a moment I'll never forget. 
[00:04:00]  And you will all be able to remember it with me right now.  Here it is.  Opie pouring the mustard out the window.  We talked about it earlier today on the show.  It will replay at 3 o'clock if you didn't catch the discussion earlier this morning.  But here it is on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, he's gone.  That's good.  He didn't say goodbye.  How fucking rude.  Oh, oh, oh, no.  Wait, Opie.  Where are you going, Opie?  Opie, no.  Oh, no.  He's trying to get him through the window as he comes out. 
[00:04:30]  He's got to come out the door.  And one of these windows are over the door.  Mustard bomb.  Tell Opie not to drop the whole mustard thing, though.  Don't fucking hit the guy with it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Man, it's like every time I come on your show.  Bump from Letterman's bad enough.  Someone just apologize on the sidewalk and line him up.  Someone go down and apologize.  Somebody's doing it.  Tell him to take the gay police thing off so we don't have a hate crime on our hands. 
[00:05:00]  No, he never said he was gay.  He never even said that.  He never had to.  No, we did.  I mean, San Francisco, 40, never been married.  Toothpicker.  Oh, my God.  I don't see him yet.  I swear I thought he would have, uh, I got, I thought I was going to get away from him.  Ask for a picture.  I'm too soft for this.  We get paid for this?  This is brutal today.  Oh, there's an old guy.  I'm going to practice. 
[00:05:30]  No.  There's an old guy in a tricycle, uh, like, uh, like, uh, like, uh, little rascal.  That helps him walk.  What is it called?  A walker.  No, no.  Like the hole.  Oh, guys.  Now.  Oh, is that brutal.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[00:06:00]  Did you get him?  They'll probably just think they got shit on by a bird that just had a Hammond Swiss.  With mustard.  Lots of mustard.  Throw some Dwayne Reed milk on him.  Is that him right there?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I got to apologize to the listeners that had to sit through all that, that fucking toothpick 
[00:06:30]  bullshit.  All of us were just trying to work up enough nerve to do something to him.  But it was getting to the point where we're like, all right, we got to do something to  him.  What?  Hide the mustard.  Oh, no.  Who was taking a picture with him?  No one saw anything.  Who went to take a picture with him?  Oh, I think I got the wrong guy. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, shit.  He's just mustard from the sky.  That's good.  That's funny.  You hide the mustard.  Meanwhile, you're telling two countries.  Yeah.  Smooth.  Everyone, keep it under your hats, eh?  Oh, my God.  I'm weird with this stuff now.  I understand how this works.  What?  I want you to do it.  Yes.  But I don't want to watch it being done.  And I want no responsibility.  And I want no responsibility.  What happened, Sam?  He's on his way back up, but I ran ahead to make sure you knew that there's a very upset 
[00:07:30]  random Asian man with mustard on him.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding?  That's what he said, Sam.  How bad did the Asian guy get it?  I don't know if mustard stains, sweaters, and nice work clothes. 
[00:08:00]  I hope he doesn't have an interview or something to go through.  If he does, I hope it's with Nathan's.  Danny, what happened?  Danny's back up.  Here's Danny.  From downstairs.  What happened with Asian man?  He just appeared out of nowhere walking down the block.  Someone is saying, why is the Asian guy upset?  He's already yellow.  Dave C. from New York City.  That's terrible.  Oh, guys.  After Opie Live. 
[00:08:30]  That was one of the cringiest moments that I've ever been a part of.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam Roberts here.  All the guys.  Not all the guys.  Opie and Anthony are gone.  Jim is headed out to San Francisco this weekend.  His new CD, Despicable, is out, though.  But the rest of us are here.  Troy Kwan just walked in.  First of all, you have been with the show for about a year.  You're lucky that you didn't have to be the one who had to avoid eye contact with an Asian man on the street as mustard came down from the sky and hit him in the shoulder. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it sounds ridiculous, dude.  Yeah, it was insane.  I was bringing you, when you were doing your thing in the hallway, are you really DJing Roland's pizza party today?  Yeah, I'm getting set up right now.  I'm ready to do it.  I mean, you have equipment and everything?  Yeah, I'm bringing the thunder.  Do you think it makes any sense to do that in that little office?  It's going to be a good time.  I'm going to keep people moving.  Just create the good vibe, you know?  And what's the guest list like right now?  You know, I haven't seen the guest list lately, but it's getting pretty large. 
[00:09:30]  It's growing, isn't it?  That's what I thought.  Well, we'll get back to the pizza party in a minute, but we wanted to play a little more of Toothpick Man because that was pretty much just the Asian guy and the mustard.  Just to get a little taste, Toothpick Man went back up to the studio for whatever reason.  We were able to convince him to come back.  And, E-Rock, this time we did get that cringe moment, yes?  Yes, this is, for all the old, old XM fans, you may remember the poker chips.  Yes, here it is. 
[00:10:00]  But Toothpick Man meets the poker chips on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We had an interesting day here.  Yeah.  Interesting day.  What's going on?  Well, we're kind of done with you.  We're done?  How is the...  We're kind of done with you?  Oh, you're done.  Yeah, we're like wrapping up, I guess.  No problem.  But absolutely, thanks for coming down.  Hey, thank you very much for having me.  You've been a good sport, as they say.  Good sport.  I try to be a good sport.  Another plug for the website.  T-W-O-P-I-C-K.  Why is he still sitting? 
[00:10:30]  Well, I'm just trying to give him a plug.  Someone's going to get fired.  Would that be Sam?  Get this one trick pony out of here, Sam, please.  All right.  I'm only trying to give him a plug.  Ralphie.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  You're out, Ralphie.  Wait, wait, wait.  Toothpick.  Oh, there.  Oh, I...  Take care.  Take it easy.  What's your name again?  Jimmy, did he...  Is that yours?  Did you leave something behind the mic there?  No.  Oh, you mean the toothpick?  No, no.  There's something.  Please don't.  There's an ID or something.  Fall on the floor.  No.  Oh! 
[00:11:00]  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Yeah, exactly.  Get out.  Oh, I didn't see...  Oh, I didn't see the...  The poker chips coming.  I'm so...  Holy shit.  Okay.  Look.  I gotta go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, dude.  How do you do that?  I didn't see that.  I'm not looking, so I can't even see...  I'm looking at my sunglasses on the table.  My eyes are shut and covered with my hands, just because I feel the urge to open them. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  That was...  The guy's just making toothpick art.  He just wants to be left alone and not die with broth in his hands.  He's talking to Anthony.  He's cracking me up.  I can't.  He's reporting it, Anthony.  Come on.  No, no.  I'm so done with this show.  We go home now.  After Opie and Anthony live.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Sam Roberts. 
[00:12:00]  And, I mean, to me, there's not a lot cringier than hearing the poker chips slam and then  hearing that guy go, oh, man.  I mean, can you imagine the humiliation of just trying to show your artwork and getting  an entire poker set slammed at you?  That's the beauty of this show, though.  Well, also, an update on that is that he got bumped from doing Letterman.  He never did Letterman.  Nope.  What's Gabe doing out there?  Troy, could you grab Gabe for a second?  The Rod and Fez intern?  I want to... 
[00:12:30]  Gabe?  Yeah, let's see what...  Gabe's coming in here for Rod and Fez.  Just any of them.  They're all on.  Oh.  So, did you...  You were listening a little to Opie and Anthony back in the day.  Yeah, I was.  Did you ever hear when the Toothpick Man was on and got poker chips thrown at him?  I remember Star Wars guy.  I don't remember Toothpick Man.  This is why after Opie and Anthony live is so great.  I highly recommend checking that bit out, because Troy just heard it.  I mean, is there anything cringier than hearing that guy get a full poker chip set thrown at him? 
[00:13:00]  I missed it.  I was actually out in the hallway.  What are you, busy working?  Yeah.  Sorry, dude.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  E-Rock, I can't work with any of these people.  Nope.  Well, E-Rock, yesterday we celebrated a day in the history of Opie and Anthony when we went over the last, the blowing up of K-Rock, the last K-Rock appearance.  Not just a day for the history of Opie and Anthony, but a day for the history of radio as we know it, because nobody ended their reign on any kind of medium the way we did it at K-Rock. 
[00:13:30]  And that was almost a nail in the coffin of terrestrial radio, really.  I mean, that was the last sort of hurrah.  Now you got, you know, Nick Cannon on 92.3 now.  You could take that for what it's worth.  But E-Rock, every day it feels like there's a celebration.  There's something that happened in history of the Opie and Anthony show.  And today is no different, because ladies and gentlemen, listening to after Opie and Anthony live at home, today is the day. 
[00:14:00]  Two years ago on this very day, Stephen Adler was approached, met, and greeted by one of his biggest fans in the world, former Ron and Fez producer, Eastside Dave.  Now, if you haven't heard this before, you're in for a treat.  And if you have heard it before, you know you miss hearing it every day, because Eastside Dave is a very passionate person.  He used to be a producer on Ron and Fez.  He now co-hosts with me on Special Delivery on the weekends. 
[00:14:30]  But he is the biggest Guns N' Roses fan in the world.  And he has the mentality of a child in some ways, where he just gets these bursts of joy that he can't contend with, as was the case when he met Stephen Adler.  We got some pizza party stuff to go to, but we will play this, and I believe hear from Eastside Dave afterwards.  But this is it.  Eastside Dave meeting Stephen Adler right here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:15:00]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stephen, trust me, you're safe.  I preface this by saying that.  Nothing will happen to you whatsoever.  But we do work with one of the, no, probably the biggest Guns N' Roses fan ever.  And when he met, who was it, Duff McKagan for the first time?  What did he end up doing?  Sticking a banana up his ass to show his appreciation?  This guy is hardcore.  He's G.G. Allen.  Hardcore fan. 
[00:15:30]  I'll set him for a big hug.  He doesn't eat the banana.  Are we, is Eastside Dave coming in to say hi to Stephen Adler?  All right.  Chip, you might want to protect your buddy here.  Nothing's going to happen.  Okay, good.  But this guy is.  Dave is just, come on in, Dave.  Look, look.  He's got his, he's got a guitar.  He's got his guitar, hero guitar.  I know Dave.  How do you know Dave?  You know Dave?  How do you know Dave?  From yesterday.  From yesterday.  I know Dave.  From yesterday.  From yesterday.  I love this. 
[00:16:00]  What's this yesterday?  I talked to him yesterday?  Oh.  Yeah.  David, what do you want to say to Stephen Adler?  I just want to say he's my favorite drummer of all time.  For real.  This is real.  Know me.  Calm down.  You can't talk.  Calm down.  I know.  But I'm a drummer and I get a little bit excited.  I play the drums just because of Stephen Adler and I'm not just joking around.  That's why I became a G&R fan.  Mr. Brownstone, you know, My Michelle, all these songs. 
[00:16:30]  I could sing a little bit if you want.  Yeah, sure.  I think Stephen would appreciate it because I don't think he's heard these songs in a while.  Here's the thing.  I know you're always looking for lead singers and I can do whatever you want.  Why don't you put the guitar down?  You need a little room for this.  Stephen, you might want to sit down and enjoy this.  Let's do a little Mr. Brownstone.  This is what Stephen, to me, represents because he plays the shit out of the drums on this  opening song.  You want to hear a little of the song?  You want headphones or you don't need them there, Dave?  I'm a fucking pro, just like Stephen is.  All right.  Why don't we start the song? 
[00:17:00]  And then afterwards, we're going to have some hot dogs or something.  Yeah, this is for you, Stephen Adler.  All right.  This is real.  Here we go.  A little Brownstone.  Come on, Stephen!  Come on, baby!  Holy Christ.  You got that steak watch.  Dave is dancing, man.  I got the snake dance.  Yeah, good.  Now, this is what we do.  I'm from New Jersey.  You're from California.  We both had hard lives growing up.  Oh!  Yeah! 
[00:17:30]  You like it?  I love it.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I get up around seven.  Get up and around nine.  I don't worry about nothing, no.  Because words are wasting my fucking time.  Yeah!  All right!  Welcome to your sex-difteen.  We'll be right back.  Yeah!  Show you USHR around seven.  We go on stage around nine.  Get on the bus the man. 
[00:18:00]  I don't sip and drink and feel it fine.  Woo!  We've been dancing with  Winston Brownstone.  He's been knocking.  He won't let me alone.  No, no, no.  He won't let me alone.  No, no, no  I do a little but a little wouldn't do it  So a little got more and more  I just keep trying to get a little better  And a little better than you thought  I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it 
[00:18:30]  So a little got more and more  I just keep trying to get a little better  Than you thought  I'm leaving the mansion with Mr. Brownstone  Leaving the diamond  He was easy and long  You're my favorite  I love you too  I love you so much  When you signed my guitar 
[00:19:00]  Oh my god  Goddamn Dave  Jumping in a circle  Dave  You missed it  He's everything to me  He's my favorite drummer  I know that isn't even any bullshit  Everyone knows that about you  Listen, let's get  Let's talk for some brass tacks  Matt Sorum's a big fat pussy  Isn't he?  No, let's fucking not bullshit around  Do you think  And I love Matt Sorum  I do too 
[00:19:30]  You know, but his drumming was a little bit lazy  On Use Your Illusions  Didn't have the razzle dazzle  You know that  Matt Sorum is a great drumming machine  He's not  He doesn't play  He's not full of feel  He's missing the Stephen Adler soul  He doesn't have to feel the heart and the soul  But he's a great drummer  He's missing Stephen Adler's spirit  Fucked up Use Your Illusion  But it's not his fault  You are so out of shape  They're both  Stephen's trying to catch his brother  Dave is so out of shape  You're a mess  I know, I was wearing my lucky shirt for Stephen 
[00:20:00]  But  This is my lucky shirt  Yeah  Stephen, let's also talk about shitty drummers  The guy's from Bon Jovi  He's not very good  He's great  He's your favorite  He does fucking awesome  Okay, what about Keithman?  Was he your favorite drummer?  No, no  Roger Meadows Taylor's my favorite drummer  Okay  Oh, really?  Yeah  The high voice, the singing  Is that what you like?  Everything  I love his playing and the singing  I could sing backup for you guys, no?  Couldn't I?  No, you're right  But no, if you want to come to the show

[00:26:00]  And she got all these big thug bodyguards  To basically push me in the face  And here I am dancing with  What I'm saying is  Here I am dancing with an A-lister  And Stephen Adler  Yeah  It couldn't have been more of a gentleman  That's the way you rock  Not like this fucking Whitney Houston, Samuel  Are you worried when you're meeting idols  Like your Guns N' Roses guys  That they're not going to be  These people that you put on the pedestals  That you do  Like that they are going to be dicks  Absolutely  Because when I met Duff 
[00:26:30]  On the Open Anthony show  He definitely thought  There's going to be a problem  And I could see his fists were clenched  The entire interview  He didn't quite  And then Slash didn't even want you near him  No, I mean  I was  Why?  Because I was wearing  I cut the sleeves off a G&R  Shirt and was wearing a Dr. Seuss  You know, hat  Thinking that I was  I was dressed in a Slash costume  I don't know why  You know, you would want to meet  That type of shit  Well, did you end up  Taking your clothes off  When you met Stephen Adler? 
[00:27:00]  I did  Well, here's the thing  That you didn't hear  In that interview  Yeah  Was  When I started to dance  See, I always had a problem  I always went to the  I had to go to the bathroom  Right around 10.30 or so  Sure  I mean, yeah  Yeah  Oh, so  So right around  Right around right now  You're feeling bathroom time  I just went  I just went on the phone  I was listening to that segment  Fantastic  And while I  People react that way a lot 
[00:27:30]  Yeah  And while I danced  Well, and they should  While I was dancing with Stephen Adler  This is an exclusive  Just for you  For the  What is this thing called?  After Opie and Anthony Live  I know  It'll  People will remember it eventually  Okay  Here's an exclusive for you, Samuel  Okay  A little bit  Just a little bit  I'm not gonna fucking make it out  Like a big thing  Like, oh  You know  But a little trickle  Of, you know  Excrement  Came down  My right 
[00:28:00]  Oh, dang  That's disgusting  That's an exclusive  Right for you  Now, I didn't say anything  To Stephen Adler  Because I still wanted  To get close to him  Yeah  You probably smelled  Yeah, and what I  Also, what I planned to do  Was I wanted to go out  Drinking with these fucking guys  You know, maybe get drinking  Get some drugs  You know, beat fucking Dr. Drew up  He obviously didn't help out  That Alice in Chains guy that much  So  No  You know, call him a fraud  And just, you know  Have some drinks  With Stephen Adler  But you're one of the few people

[00:30:00]  Roland  Roland just walked  Into the studio  Don't make comments  Like that  This is not  This is not  An ugly show  Like that  But Roland is here  He just walked in  Like you look exhausted  Are you pizza party planning?  Yes, I am  Shit has to be done  I guess  And by chit  You mean shit  Correct?  That too  Correct  We were talking about  Roland's big pizza party  All day today  I went  Talking to some people  Around here  I talked to some of the people  Who work at Sirius XM  Including Roland  Management  And asked them 
[00:30:30]  What they thought  About the pizza party  So here's  Here's some of the people  From Sirius XM  So what have you guys  Heard about this pizza party?  I've heard  There's going to be  A bubble machine  Danny  You got invited, right?  Of course  Does anybody know  Why Roland's doing this?  Yes, I do  Why?  I do believe  Roland suggested  To our management  That we have a pizza party  Because  Something good happened  Right?  The old car crash comedy  Went so well  That Roland felt 
[00:31:00]  That we deserved  A pizza party  So he asked  Gary  One of our management team  And kind of  Just didn't get  An answer on that  So Roland decided  To throw his own  So he's just  Going to take money  Out of his pocket  And throw a pizza party  Yeah, he's done that before  I mean there was a time  Roland  We just kind of jokingly  Said hey Roland  Buy us lunch  And he went and spent  Like $200 on Wendy's  Mikey Piff  From Hits 1  I heard you know  About the pizza party  I got a personal invite  I was really excited  I still don't know  What it's for  What is going on?  All I know is that  There was an email 
[00:31:30]  Circulated  Not quite sure  How large the listing was  Who sent you the email?  Roland?  What have you heard  Is going to be at the pizza party?  Pizza?  I've heard rumors  Of balloons  And  A man in a bear costume  Singing some sort of tunes  Oh and it's Troy Kwan  I know you're ready  You're going to the pizza party  Right?  I'm not only going to be there  I'm DJing the event  What?  Yes  Yes  Roland asked me to come in  Play some music 
[00:32:00]  Keep the party moving  Keep the people out  On the dance floor  Where is the party taking place?  I believe it's in his office  Over there  So  That's the size of a college dorm room  Maybe slightly smaller  Yeah it's going to be fine  It's just like a little house party  We're going to keep the party moving  You're DJing the party?  Yes  Yes I'll be DJing the party  And just having a good time  You know?  Steve Storniolo from the comedy channel  Is funny in the morning  What do you know about Roland's pizza party?  You're right outside the office from him  I hear Roland talking about food 24-7  What do you know about the pizza party? 
[00:32:30]  You were invited right?  No I wasn't  I just was going to say  I always hear Roland and Eric  Talking about food  Always  But you don't know anything  About the pizza party?  I've heard them talk about pizza  Countless times  You didn't get an invite?  I didn't know there was a party  No I did not get an invite  Oh alright  Sorry  Can I come?  I don't do the invites  Rob Cross  What's management's view  On Roland's pizza party? 
[00:33:00]  I think stoked  Is the official management position  On the pizza party  Stoked  What if something goes wrong?  Unstoked  Is this going to  What could go wrong?  There's a bubble machine  And he's going to try to pack  Dozens of guests into his office  Oh yeah  Maybe we shouldn't have this  Maybe we should run it by legal  It's after  Opie and Anthony live  Roland  This is the story of the century  I mean for whatever reason  You decided to throw  The greatest pizza party  Of all time  And then  While this  While those clips were playing 
[00:33:30]  It wasn't very long  Two major things happened  Which we'll get into both  The first one  We'll get into second  But I'll say it first  Somebody  I won't mention his name  In case he doesn't want  To get mentioned  Said that  They're trying to book you  For a meeting  Oh no  That's going to  Coincide with the pizza party  Oh no  They moved the meeting time  That coincides to the pizza party  Is there sabotage?  I'm not going to say it  Uh huh  But I smell  Apollo landing  Oh wow  This is awful 
[00:34:00]  But in even bigger news  Roland  You walked in here  With a celebrity  I'm assuming  You didn't book them  For after Opie and Anthony Live  I booked them  For the pizza party  This is  Kevin Cristiano  From Project Runway  Of course  Yes  Such a celebrity  Um  I mean I saw you on TV  Well the guys  The guys did announce  Some this morning  Huh?  Oh lovely  Opie did say  You're coming  Yeah but he said  Your friend Kevin  Not the guy  From Project Runway  Now  Did you realize 
[00:34:30]  When Roland  Who books talent  For  Usually shows  Was booking you  He was actually booking you  For a pizza party  That he was throwing  For no reason  No I had no idea  I actually thought  I was coming on  The live Opie and Anthony  Show  I like told my family  And stuff  Oh Jesus Roland  What are you doing?  So they're all like  Listening  And they're like  Now I'm back  To being schwul again  Yeah  They're like yeah  We thought you were famous  For a second  Fifteen minutes is up  But you  You instead  Kind of tricked him  Into  Cause you needed  Some kind  I told the whole office  I'm like dude  I'm coming  I'm gonna plug us  Well you could 
[00:35:00]  You could still plug  I mean it's  Technically  It's still continuing  Yeah after Opie and Anthony  Live is still technically  Opie and Anthony  Just without  Opie  Or Anthony  Or we book him tomorrow  To give a play by play  We could  What did you want to  Wait technically  Wasn't I like  Called Anthony  At some point  Yeah  During the Jets game  Everybody wanted to  Picture with him  Because they go  Hey Anthony  I thought he was Anthony  Yeah  Why  Oh what  Cause Opie was there  Here's another  Schwul moment  Of being a reality star  After three seasons 
[00:35:30]  Somebody stops me  And Opie moves to the side  At the Jets game  And they're like  Oh my god  Can I take a picture with you  And I'm like  Yeah sure  Whatever it happens  You know  Sure  And Opie's like  Cool man  He's like  You know  So I take the picture  He's like  I love your guy's show  He's like  Are you fucking kidding me  He's like  Did you think you're Anthony  And I'm like  This is just fucking bad  That's embarrassing  Yeah that's awful  But now  You're being tricked into  Just getting booked for  I mean this is  A club appearance 
[00:36:00]  Except it's in somebody's office  For one hour  That's right  Pizza's good though  What's the motivation  Like seriously  Like this is weird  Crazy  Maniacal behavior  It's not though  It is  It's insane  You're not in a management position  You're not  You're just taking money  Out of your own pocket  And throwing a grandiose  Pizza party  For no reason  I've done that many times before  Why  Because  I see people  Morale down  Yeah  I'm gonna cheer people up  You're gonna be the morale booster  Is that a sin  No Roland 
[00:36:30]  It's not  I mean  God  Now  Is there anybody  It seems like this guest list  Is getting out of control though  Because like  The only person  That I talked to here  Was Steve Sterniolo  Who works on the comedy channels  For Funny in the Morning  No that's Shapiro  No  Sterniolo  Was not invited  I don't know who he is  But I'm Shapiro  I guess he's another guy  Who works on the comedy channel  Is there any  Worry  That you're going to break  Fire code restrictions  I don't think so 
[00:37:00]  I mean Rob Cross  When I talked to him  He was kind of laughing it off  When he said  Maybe we should talk to legal  But he did seem alarmed  When I brought up the idea  That  This was all gonna go on  In your office  And there were gonna be  Lots of people in there  That is true  Do you have the pizza yet?  No  It comes at noon  We're about an hour  And ten minutes out  Right now  I did get the cake though  Is the bubble machine here?  Is in the Nagelmobile  Nagel  When is the bubble machine  Coming out?  Are you still here?  There you are 
[00:37:30]  Yeah as soon as we're  Done with this  We've got the bubble machine  The cookie platter  And a few other things  Who else is in there  With you coughing?  We have Pepper  And Zito  From the Ron and Fez show  And Pepper wants to know  Where the fuck is their pizza?  Well tell Pepper  Tell him that Zito  It's his responsibility  To throw a party  I stepped up for our show  Zito needs to step up  For his show  Pepper you didn't get  Invited to the pizza party?  I didn't get invited  No but you know  The show's online  During that time  So you know whatever  So it's just an asshole  Move either way  Roland are the Ron and Fez 
[00:38:00]  Guys invited?  Zito should throw  A party for them  I'm just saying that  I throw a party for us  Mark Zito  You're saying  Roland is saying  That it's your job  To throw a party  For Ron and Fez  Yeah just fuck E-Rock  He specifically asked us  If we want to talk about this  And I said no  And I said no  I don't want to talk  About this pizza party  And then he brought it up  Why don't you want to talk  About the pizza party?  Because he doesn't have  The cojones like I do  He's saying  You know what  I'm doing it myself  What's up Pee Hickety?  Well as was said 
[00:38:30]  On the Ron and Fez show  Yesterday  It's an open invite  To have the party  In studio here with us  I mean  Yeah why don't we move the party?  But then it becomes  A whole other issue  What's the other issue?  Come on  There's more space  More people  And you got  You got a celebrity here  I'm sure Ron would want to do  You know  Ron Benetton interviews  Right?  If Ron interviews Kevin  Then it's a different story  There I just threw  The gauntlet  Oh my god  Now I'm seeing you working  Now I'm seeing you actually working  That's good  That's good  If you guys want pizza  And invite cake  And other goodies  And actually be talked about 
[00:39:00]  You guys can interview Kevin  Well we have a celebrity name  We have a gauntlet thrown down  I can't wait for this  Now the ball is in  Mr. Benetton's court  Who I respect and love  And Mr. Fist  I can't wait for this pizza party  To begin  And then if he does  Interview Kevin  You just keep going  I'm trying to wind down  I do my impression of Dave  Isn't that annoying?  Don't say that about Dave  I don't agree with you there  He's an asshole  Don't  I mean this is not  Your venue for that  I'm sorry  Ron is coming in  But we're trying to give him  His time  Ron we're wrapping up 
[00:39:30]  We're trying to give you  Your time  Crossover time  It is  Hey stay tuned for  Pop Tarts Thursdays  On the Ron and Fez show  When you hear the  Pop Tarts sound  Or dial 1-800-POP-TART  Ron and Fez is coming up next  Thank you for listening to  After Opie and Anthony Live  The Opie and Anthony show  Is now over  For real this time  Thank you for listening to </pre>
