<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about the excessively long length of Major League Baseball games, particularly those on the West Coast, citing low ratings, especially for the Rockies-Diamondbacks playoff series.  A caller claimed the actual "action" in a game averaged only 8 minutes.  The conversation then shifted to Don Imus's return to radio and the hypocrisy surrounding the reactions from certain media figures.  A Patrice O'Neal YouTube video rebutting a black female journalist criticizing Imus was promoted.  The hosts interjected with humorous anecdotes and impressions of bizarre Japanese game shows.  Other topics included a listener's joke about Hempstead's chicken restaurants, Opie's self-proclaimed "sports curse," and advertisements for XM Satellite Radio, Quicken Loans, Gamefly, and NHL Home Ice.  The arrest of a man caught having sex with a three-year-old girl was also discussed, leading to a conversation about appropriate punishments and the likelihood of the perpetrator receiving protective custody in prison. A $1000 contest for the tenth caller to identify a sound effect was introduced.

The $1000 contest continued, with "Jelly Roll" (or possibly "Joey") winning and receiving playful berating from the hosts.  This transitioned into a discussion of one host's recent dinner with Roland, his brother's embarrassing stories, and a subsequent argument with his girlfriend over retrieving her computer. The argument was discussed, focusing on exhaustion and differing preferences on how to spend time together.  The show then dissected the "Living XL" catalog for obese individuals, mocking the products (leg lifter, oversized toilet seat, long-handled toenail clipper, etc.).  Callers responded, some agreeing with the satire, others expressing offense.  Doug challenged the hosts' fat-shaming, leading to a debate about personal responsibility and addiction.  Callers continued the discussion, expressing anger, defending their lifestyles, and sharing personal weight-loss stories.  The hosts' tone shifted to more empathy, acknowledging the hurtful nature of their jokes. The discussion continued, including a mention of Jim Norton's HBO special.

A heated discussion regarding Reverend Al Sharpton's reaction to Imus's return dominated the next segment.  The hosts strongly criticized Sharpton's comments, race-baiting, and focus on Imus while ignoring gang violence and graffiti. They used highly offensive language, sarcastically questioning Sharpton's representation of black people and suggesting his actions were self-serving.  The presence of hangman nooses was downplayed in comparison to gang signs and graffiti. The conversation then shifted to a humorous news report about a woman who fell asleep under an SUV and got trapped when the tires were deflated while spying on her husband.  Finally, the assault of Air America host Randy Rhodes was discussed, debating whether it was a random act or a politically motivated attack by a "right-wing hate machine," as suggested by Rhodes' co-host.  The hosts mocked this claim and elaborated on a fictional "hate machine." Listener calls continued throughout, addressing the fat-people catalog and other topics.  The upcoming auction of Hitler's globe was mentioned, provoking humorous speculation.

A caller's joke about Anthony's Escalade being a "hate machine" initiated the next segment, leading to banter about Anthony's perceived anger.  This transitioned to a clip of a child asking Rudy Giuliani about alien attacks, sparking a discussion about the absurdity of the question and Giuliani's response.  Jimmy expressed disgust at a chewed-on pen, leading to a search for the pen-chewer, Earl Douglas, and more crude humor.  They returned to the Giuliani clip, focusing on his unprepared answer.  Callers discussed various sexual acts and personal experiences.  Topics included a news story about a "Naked Tickler," Al Roker's weight, CD player issues, Ronald Reagan's alleged alien speech, racial stereotypes in movies, and sexual preferences.  Sexologist Logan Lefkoff joined to discuss their book, "Third Base Ain't What It Used to Be," leading to a conversation about sexuality, including masturbation, safe sex practices (and dental dams), body image, and societal attitudes towards sex.  The conversation included numerous sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes.  A caller, "Flea," was ridiculed for poor artistic skills. The segment concluded with promotion of Logan's book and Bodog Fantasy.

The final segment continued the discussion with Logan Lefkoff, using highly explicit language to cover a wide range of sexual topics including slang terms for promiscuous women, the definition of "three-holer," graphic descriptions of sexual acts, the G-spot, sexual positions, challenges in long-term relationships, father-daughter purity balls, the age of consent, and sexual preferences.  Callers asked Logan questions about sexual techniques, sex lives, squirt orgasms, and swinging.  The hosts interjected with crude jokes and personal anecdotes.  "Flea" was again ridiculed for his drawings.  The segment ended with promotion of Logan's book and Bodog Fantasy.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1-2-1-2.  Poe, poe, boo, boe, banana, nana.  Banana, fana, foe, foe, fee, fi, mo, mo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Steelers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff, and they just threw him in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left him there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants to get rock star.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one,  to feel his man hand holding your head like the sweat of a man hand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst.  The worst showing.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank you.  Not you.  Not now.  No, of course not.  So don't bother.  That's today's sound, though.  We'll play that between 7 and 7.30.  If you're the 10th caller to the Opie and Anthony show at 877-212-ONAU.  Today, you will win $1,000. 
[00:02:00]  The second I thought you were going to say a million.  I was like, wow.  What?  That would be nice.  Hell of a prize.  But no.  A thousand.  Go Sox, go.  Go Sox, go.  Oh, boy.  Now you're getting the Boston people angry.  Now they're down.  Two games to one. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, look.  Shut up, Opie.  Please knock it off.  Go Sox, go.  Go Sox, go.  Look, man.  My team, the Mets, were knocked out.  So then I went with the Phillies.  My Phillies got knocked out.  So now I've got to go with the Sox.  Go Sox, go.  Yeah.  A pretty tough loss there.  And now they're on the brink of elimination. 
[00:03:00]  And who won last night?  Because I couldn't stay up until 3 in the morning.  Sorry.  Oh, the Rockies ended up winning.  I believe it was the Colorado Rockies.  Rockies.  The World Series.  Rockies sweep the diamonds.  Diamondback.  Advanced to the World Series.  Rockies have won 21 of the last 22 games.  Yep.  And the game ended around 3 in the morning, right around the time we all woke up to do  the radio show.  Major League Baseball is so stupid. 
[00:03:30]  They are so stupid.  Yeah, I was flicking around the channels.  I saw the game starting at like 10 o'clock.  You understand it's out west, but oof.  Yeah, well, the hell are you supposed to?  You're leaving half the country out of your games.  Well, that's why Major League Baseball is really, really stupid.  Yeah, you've got a West Coast thing happening, obviously.  But somewhere along the line, the last 5, 6, maybe 7 years, baseball decided to take 
[00:04:00]  twice as long.  When we were growing up, you had pitchers.  Boom.  Ball.  Boom.  Ball.  Boom.  Strike.  Strike.  Strike.  Strike them out.  Next batter.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Yeah.  They would just keep firing the pitches in.  Now, after every pitch, they've got to look at each other.  They look to the dugout.  Then the catcher comes out to the mound.  They have a little chit-chat.  I would love to know the average, maybe they did this during the broadcast, the average  time in between pitches.  It has to be some ridiculous amount of time. 
[00:04:30]  And then I love the one guy, you know, they've got to bring in the lefty.  So the one guy pitches like three pitches.  Right.  And then they've got to change again.  They go to commercial.  They come back.  He's still warming up.  Yeah.  That's a specialist thing.  When you see the guy come out and tap his left arm, you're like, oh, right.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  When you see the tap, tap, tap, going to the left arm, you're thinking to yourself, well,  this is going to be at least 10 minutes and I'm only going to see one batter.  Great.  I do that in bathroom stalls.  Tap my left arm. 
[00:05:00]  You know what that means?  That's right.  I'm going to get a...  That means jiggle.  Yeah, but the point is simple.  Major League Baseball, they know all this is happening.  It's been happening for many, many years now.  So what do they do?  They do nothing.  So the entire East Coast is not staying up until 3 a.m. to watch the Rockies.  Hell no.  And the Diamondbacks.  I don't think anybody on the East Coast cared, but that's beside the point.  Well, these games, I was reading the paper the other night, one of the games went four  hours and 40 minutes. 
[00:05:30]  You know, one of these West Coast games ended just before 3 a.m.  That's ridiculous.  What is Major League Baseball doing?  I would start the games on the West Coast, 5, 6 o'clock, and you might say to yourself,  well, people are still at work.  Who cares?  It's the first couple innings.  The game will still be on at 9, 10 o'clock at night anyway.  You know, you wouldn't watch the most action-packed, greatest movie if it was that long.  You wouldn't, like, go to the movies to see it.  You know how people are like, oh, my God, that movie's too long. 
[00:06:00]  That's the problem with it.  The movie's too long.  It was like 3 hours and 10 minutes.  Yeah.  But you're expected to just sit there and watch 4, 5 hours of baseball.  Of baseball.  Sorry.  No.  I could watch 4 hours of hockey.  I could watch 4 hours of football.  4 1⁄2 hours of baseball?  Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  You get up to 4 hours of any sport, and you start getting like, all right, come on already.  Enough.  Especially baseball.  And we've been talking about this the last couple days, and sure enough in the papers, 
[00:06:30]  the ratings for these games are just ridiculously bad.  How are they for the first?  Ridiculously bad.  How are they for the first few hours?  Are they like, say, from like 9 to 11 or 8 to 10 or something like that?  Are they decent then?  Then they got to get crappy after that?  That's a good point.  I'm wondering if they don't care.  I think it's gotten to the point where people just understand these games are taking so  long, and if you're not a Red Sox fan or an Indians fan, you're like, I'm not invested  in this, because I know the game's going to be over way past my bedtime. 
[00:07:00]  I've got to work like a human being tomorrow.  Where do they find that people will watch 2 hours of it and go to bed?  I'm wondering how they do it.  I don't know.  I really don't know, Jimmy.  But I was watching the Red Sox game last night.  It was well after 9 o'clock.  It wasn't even the third inning.  I'm like, this is stupid.  This is so stupid.  Unless you're a Red Sox fan, of course you're going to stay to the end, and of course you're  going to be a little tired today.  Of course.  But Major League Baseball, they need the rest of the country to watch these games to get 
[00:07:30]  the ratings up, and it's just not happening.  Let's say hi to Pete in Lindenhurst.  Pete, what's up?  How you doing, Opie?  The average Major League game, I was told, in terms of action actually on the field,  is 8 minutes.  Oh yeah, I've read those articles before.  Yeah.  If you add up all the actual action or whatever, it's 8 minutes.  Just when the ball's in play.  Right, that's how long a game actually takes.  8 minutes.  8 minutes. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, like if a ball is, like say a pitcher throws a ball and it gets it to fly out.  Yeah, yeah.  But the first three pitches, the foul balls, all that crap takes three minutes for the  actual fly out.  The ball is in action for 8 minutes.  That means the pitcher throwing the ball.  That means the batter hitting the ball.  That means the field are throwing to first base.  That means the center fielder catching it for the third out.  It averages about 8 minutes.  Pete is right.  Wow.  8 minutes.  8 minutes.  But like I read in the paper, one of these games the other night, 4 hours and 40 minutes. 
[00:08:30]  Here we go.  The Colorado Rockies, 11-8, 3-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Game 2 on Friday night.  Drew a 2.2 national rating.  Less than half of the lowest ever primetime LCS rating before this season.  Wow.  Just horrendous ratings.  I also think because both of those are expansion teams, they would do terrible.  Yeah, no one cares.  Something about the expansion teams people just hate.  No one really has a passion for them.  Well, the Indians won in 11 innings over the Sox the other night. 
[00:09:00]  The game ran from 8.17 p.m.  They can't even start at 8.  That would save 17 minutes right there.  They're going to have the championship beat up.  Yeah.  Do your pregame from 7 to 7.30.  Get it started at 7.30.  So it went from 8.17 to, wow, 1.32 a.m.  Oof.  Wow.  That's five hours.  That's just under five hours.  That's because, you know, the telecast actually starts at 8. 
[00:09:30]  You sit down with your beer at 8.  Yeah.  You want the game to start at 8.  All right.  So they're technically saying first pitch was at 8.17.  I say, you know, you're watching starting at 8.  Game ended at 1.32 a.m.  That's what?  Five and a half hours.  The audience peaked at 12.30 a.m., Jimmy.  There's your answer.  Okay.  So after 12.30 a.m., people started leaving the game,  even though there was an hour left in the game.  And it goes on.  It gets more detailed.  But basically, the headline here, the ratings are way the F down for Major League Baseball 
[00:10:00]  in the playoffs this year.  Too long.  Let's say hi to Shannon in West Hempstead.  Shannon, what's up?  Hey, not much, guys.  I got to admit, I'm a new listener, but I just wanted to tell Jim Norton that his HBO  special was awesome.  Oh, thank you very much.  Cool.  It was so funny.  Thank you.  When did you start listening to us?  Just recently, like a month ago, because my sister's really into you guys, and she got  me hooked.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[00:10:30]  We appreciate that.  West Hempstead, huh?  Yeah.  It's a little rough, isn't it?  It's really boring here.  Isn't it a rough area?  No, Hempstead is.  West Hempstead's just boring.  Oh, really?  So awful.  Go down a little further south, Hempstead.  It won't be so boring.  No, you'll see a lot of action.  And a lot of chicken joints, too.  I once took the back roads home from my Islander game.  I got kind of lost, and I was heading back to the city. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And as a joke, wow, what a great night of entertainment.  But we decided to start keeping track of all the chicken joints.  Yeah.  Holy cow.  It is amazing.  And just ones you've never heard of before in your life.  Yeah.  We started laughing our asses off.  We couldn't go a mile without seeing some chicken joint.  Stereotype.  I don't know.  Hempstead's a weird area.  I mean, some of the most expensive property is in the village of Hempstead. 
[00:11:30]  And then some of the worst, most crime-ridden areas are also in Hempstead.  Yeah, there you go.  All right, Shannon.  Thank you.  No problem.  All right, let's say hi to Aaron in Connecticut.  Aaron, what's up?  Yeah, you guys ever want to talk about long baseball games?  You go to a Japanese baseball game.  I saw an exhibition game between the United States and Japan, and they pray in between  these.  They have these little team huddles.  It's ridiculous.  Do they?  Wait, do the players have to sit in buckets of ice naked when they're on the bench? 
[00:12:00]  Right.  I love when they're screaming.  When the opposing team hits a single, do they let the rats out to chase the run at  the first base?  Those creepy Japanese.  They're ridiculous game shows.  Their game shows are the worst.  They make them run through these obstacle courses where they're smashing their chins on  like wooden planks.  When they fall off the thing.  When the runner gets to first base, does a big boxing glove pop up in the base and hit 
[00:12:30]  him in the groin?  Oh!  Stupid Japanese and their games.  Is it really six hours, or was that just one of those rare games there, Aaron?  No, we were at an exhibition game in Bridgeport, and they literally pray in between them.  They had a team huddle every inning.  Every inning, whether they were batting or whether they were going out into the field,  they had a team huddle, and the manager at some points would just scream at them. 
[00:13:00]  I thought that was funny.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks.  When you hit a home run, you got to strip completely naked before you run around the bases.  Oh!  That's like any Japanese game show I watch.  That's all you hear.  We got the noises of Japanese game shows.  I love that bit.  Someone just gets like, something horrific happens.  Oh!  You don't understand what the guy's saying, but you know it's like, oh, he's in some pain 
[00:13:30]  there.  That's going to hurt him.  Yeah.  He looks like he's going to make it, and then he, oh, no, he fell off to the, oh!  And it always has something to do with, like, getting hit in the groin area.  Oh, they love getting hit in the groin.  Or some kind of apparatus that they had to, like, invent.  Yeah.  It's a hammer on a swinging pulley.  Yeah.  You get a nail in it.  Right.  Right.  It is.  It's like.  The best takeoff on that was an SNL skit. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Chris Farley.  I think it was, I think Alec Baldwin was part of.  No, no.  Michael Myers.  Mike Myers, whatever.  They did a whole takeoff on Japanese game shows.  That was hilarious.  I got to go.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go. 
[00:14:30]  Ah.  Just yelling.  Yelling and puking. 
[00:15:00]  Yes, then.  I'm pretty sure that one is how to describe this.  A guy is facing away from his teammate.  Okay.  Crouched over.  Okay.  Gotcha so far.  He's on sort of a sliding tray.  Okay.  And if his teammate gets the trivia question wrong or whatever, they back the tray towards  his teammate.  Okay.  And eventually he gets enough questions wrong where they meet. 
[00:15:30]  What's on the tray though?  The guy crouched over.  With a strategic portion of his pants missing.  All right.  So that's just war.  That's great.  Here's another one.  I think this was a ground rolled double. 
[00:16:00]  Someone's in pain. 
[00:16:30]  What is that one?  That's the old classic tongue twister flappy device to the groin if you get it wrong.  Oh, okay.  So you got to do a tongue twister in Japanese, obviously.  And then if you don't do it, you miss a word.  Some sort of spatula-esque device comes up.  That would be great if they had that in between first and second base during Japanese baseball 
[00:17:00]  games.  What is with the...  They have this like fixation on just degrading and hurting each other in these game shows.  I'm telling you, it's got something to do with the pornography too.  And Germany is the same thing in the pornography.  When your country loses a world war, you take it on each other.  Do you think that's it?  You just got your ass handed to you in front of the entire world like that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  We have time for one more?  Yeah, I guess that might be it.  One more.  Sounds from Japanese game shows.  Oh, that's a boring one, man. 
[00:18:00]  What's that one about?  It was just something about J-Cups.  It was just a girl, a well-endowed woman.  Oh, and he was running through bra sizes?  Yeah.  I thought he was doing the alphabet, and then if he screwed up in the English alphabet,  some type of milling machine would be dropped on his groin area.  I think they use a rolling pin. 
[00:18:30]  Let's say hi to Glenn in Boston listening on BCM.  We're going to be up there a week from this Friday for the big Halloween party there, Glenn.  What's up?  Deal, man.  Yeah.  What are you guys doing this morning?  We're...  Yeah.  I'm begging you, sir.  I'm begging you.  Please, stop rooting for the Red Sox.  It's really too late.  I mean, there wasn't even another team I wanted to pick to win it all in the American League.  Can Glenn and everyone in Boston understand this?  It's not Opie picking something that he wants to lose or deciding, oh, I'll do this and pick this team. 
[00:19:00]  It's a sincere feeling he has.  He wants the Sox to win.  He doesn't want them to lose.  See, if I follow...  Try to be impartial.  Is that what you're saying?  If I follow your logic, though, I would have said, go Yankees, go.  Because I really don't like the Yankees.  Then knowing that I have the sports curse, that would have sealed the deal that the Yankees would have lost.  They did lose, but I didn't pick the Yankees.  I don't like the Yankees. 
[00:19:30]  He doesn't really want them to win.  He really wants the Sox to win.  And don't get him wrong, he wanted Philly to win.  After the Mets lost.  After the Mets lost, because he wanted the Mets to win.  And we know how that worked out for me.  Oh!  Three and out.  Oh!  For the Phillies.  So then I went with the Phillies.  So Mets lost, I went with the Phillies, Phillies lost, and I always wanted the Red Sox in the American League.  So what can I tell you? 
[00:20:00]  Can you imagine...  Go Sox, go!  You imagine...  I'm a long-time, I'm a long-time...  Being able to get a word in this, Wes?  No, I can't, Jimmy.  Glenn wants to tell everyone he's a lifetime Red Sox fan.  No, no, just...  Oh, please.  Look around, there's many of you listening to you right now.  But you talk about ratings for baseball games, and again, you can't worry about that as a fan.  But what Indians say, Rockies...  Do you know the networks?  You've never seen people praying hard for a Red Sox victory.  They just...  Yeah.  You know the networks want the Yankees' Red Sox. 
[00:20:30]  Or Boston Mets.  They would probably ruin it for Boston.  They would die for something.  Yeah, Mets.  But this will just be...  Who cares?  Yeah, it might even be a great series, but no one will watch it.  Plus the fact that they're going to play the World Series, what, in November this year?  What the F is going on with baseball?  They're ruining their sport.  Check it out.  Thanks, Glenn.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got lots to do today.  877-212-ONA.  Let's not forget, we've got today's sound.  And it's this. 
[00:21:00]  Thank you!  When you hear that between 7 and 7.30, if you're the 10th caller, you're going to win  $1,000.  Simple as that, okay?  Don't call now.  Don't try the number.  Don't do any of that crap, because we'll just hang up on you.  Because we've got to keep the phones open so we can actually do a radio show.  Yeah.  And we thank you!  All right.  And I think we're going to talk about Imus.  Yeah, now it's coming out of the woodworks about Imus' return.  We'll get into that a little bit after the break. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, because now the news is once again proving what hypocrites they are.  Yeah.  Great.  Humans to marry robots by the year 2050.  All right.  And we look at a fine catalog that's what Steve got in the mail?  Yeah.  Did Steve get?  Oh my God, that makes it even funnier.  There's a catalog.  It's called Living XL.  Yeah.  Catalog for the morbidly obese.  With all these things you could get for your fat lifestyle.  You take for granted that fat people, they need things that we just do on a daily basis. 
[00:22:00]  They need like apparatus and things to get through life.  Where me and you and slender people just kind of don't think about it.  Right.  Where's the catalog?  Where's the catalog?  Yeah, let Jimmy look through the catalog.  You want the break?  Peruse it?  Boy, do I.  It's Opie and Anthony.  There we go. 
[00:22:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  I didn't even notice the bed didn't come on.  It was just like listening to the record.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, okay, the music's playing.  Oh, wait, that's Opie.  What is this?  Oh!  See, Nevada wants to say something.  What's up, D?  Hi.  Hi.  Opie's sports curse goes to more than just sports. 
[00:23:00]  He mentioned about steam pipes exploding the day before the one did in New York.  And he talked about news choppers not crashing a week before three news choppers crashed in two days.  Yeah, it's, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm one of these, uh, scary.  I'm one of these, uh, things.  I'm like a John Edwards, uh, uh, type of people, I think.  Uh, like Kreskin.  I'm one of those, uh, types.  I guess I, I'm feeling a weird energy all the time at this point.  So it's, it's, it's. 
[00:23:30]  I wondered, did you mention anything about Bridges claps seen a week before the bridge  clapped?  Uh, no, I think I left that one alone.  It was just too, that one was.  Thank you.  Riding the hurricane of success with her latest album.  KT Tungstall hits XM's Performance Theater.  Sunday I see, I see, why the hell it means so much to me? 
[00:24:00]  The whole point of being a musician is that you make the result yourself.  Oh, no, you're not the one for me.  Monday, October 22nd, all day long, on XMX Channel 2.

[00:28:00]  Did he deserve to be fired?  I don't know.  Reprimanded?  Yes.  Okay, reprimanded, maybe.  But fired?  I'm just not really sure about that.  His words are, you know, their words of hate and their...  The white guy, by the way.  He shouldn't have time.  He should what?  He shouldn't have time.  Black woman said he should have been reprimanded, probably not fired.  White guy, like just, you know.  White liberal guy just standing there going, no, it's the words of hate.  Shut up.  You see what I'm saying?  That, whatever her name is. 
[00:28:30]  Sonia Osorio.  But she's good, though, because she's an honest voice as to how awful most Americans are.  Like, that really is, maybe not even most American people don't think that way, but the way we've turned into, that's what we've turned into, is that, that dumbbell, just harping on the fact that when people of color, shut your mouth.  And she's accusing Imus of being a few things in that clip.  And let's say Imus was.  I personally don't think he is.  Even if he was, who gives a crap? 
[00:29:00]  Of course.  You should be able to say that whatever the hell you want on the radio.  Yep.  It might offend the hell out of you, but, you know, that's life in America.  It's part of the whole thing.  She forgot, by the way, funny.  She forgot he's racist and funny.  She forgot to say that.  Well, if you want to see what this broad is all about, Patrice O'Neal was on Fox News with her.  It's, go to YouTube, trust me on this, and put in Patrice O'Neal, O'Neal, schools broad on funny.  Uh, she's on the panel with Patrice O'Neal, saying all the same crap you just heard in this dumb clip. 
[00:29:30]  And Patrice just tools her on funny.  It is one of the greatest Opie and Anthony clips on YouTube.  It gets a lot of views.  It just unloads on her.  It's great.  It's heading toward 200,000 views, this, uh, this clip of Patrice O'Neal.  It's called Patrice O'Neal, schools broad on funny.  Mm-hmm.  Make sure you check that out sometime today.  And I'm sure that'll be part of the, uh, show rundown later on today at, uh, O-N-A-Radio.com. 
[00:30:00]  And Patrice is probably everything that she hates because, uh, he's a, he's a black guy and he's loud and he doesn't care about her approving or not.  No, no, not at all.  At all.  He was describing some of those, you know, some of the, um, uh, sexual situations that people can get into that have taken on some very clever names.  Sure.  In this day and age.  Names that we can't even mention on the radio anymore.  Thank you very much.  Well, you can't talk about the Scooby-Doo. 
[00:30:30]  Uh, I don't know, uh, what the Scooby-Doo is.  Uh, Jimmy made that up.  Things like that.  Jimmy made that up just so people understand what we're talking about.  That's right.  Yeah, exactly.  You've heard of him.  Here's another hint.  Uh, good afternoon, Cleveland.  Right.  Cleveland.  That, there you go.  Yeah.  Right, we understand.  Well, Patrice, uh, just tools her and, and, and shows her.  He gives her a couple of examples and then explains them in graphic detail what they are.  Yeah.  The mud chin.  You can't say mud, the mud chin anymore. 
[00:31:00]  No.  Uh, Jimmy made that one up too, so please don't dump out of that.  I want them to dump out of it.  I know.  It doesn't exist.  If they start dumping out of stuff that don't exist, then, you know, it's not even stuff  that exists.  Oh.  Oh, she just stayed.  But then, you know, you have to say, like, when I hear this, I feel my chest tightening  with hatred.  And I'm like, what do you expect the head of now to say?  That's, that's who they, that they don't elect.  You know, I'd like to give her a Hershey fedora.  But, so would I, what she should have said was, look, as an organization, we are not 
[00:31:30]  happy, but we, uh, understand his right to be able to go back on the air and, and be  a broadcaster in America.  Phony black journalist organization, the same crap, uh, that she's saying, nobody is saying  we don't like this guy, but he should be able to work because it's a free country and  people are going to say things I don't like.  Like, nobody says that.  It's so weird, too, because... 
[00:32:00]  We really suck as a nation.  We really do.  Well, being a white male in America sucks, uh, you know, you don't see a lot of white  males, like, protesting about what they heard on a black radio station or, or some female  talk show host saying outrageous things about men.  We just, we, it's probably going on, but we could care less, could care less about it.  You know, it's funny, I talked about how people get offended, we think for each other.  The guy that, that, that, I'm like, I've got a regular cab driver now.  And, uh, you know, it's really weird when you get into a cab and you hear, hi, Jimmy.  Right. 
[00:32:30]  And, uh, he's like, oh, I like the HBO special.  You're talking about Pakistan.  That's my hometown.  The guy's from Karachi.  And he's like, cause I made fun of it being dangerous.  And I'm like, oh my God, did I say the wrong thing?  Like, am I about to get my, you know, head smashed?  And he's like, man, that's too dangerous even for me to go.  It's like, there's a guy from Pakistan I made fun of.  He's not offended.  Yeah.  But somebody else would step in and go, well, you shouldn't make fun of Pakistan.  Yeah, exactly.  It's always people thinking for everybody else.  Something is going on with the cabbies in New York.  They're huge fans of this show.  And you're popping these cabs and you're like, there's no way this guy listens to our show. 
[00:33:00]  But they are.  Uh, let's say hi to Chris in Queens.  Chris, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, uh, about this whole, um, I miss the thing.  Yeah.  Besides the fact that I really can't stand the guy.  He actually died about five years ago.  Someone just forgot to let him know.  Oh, sorry, with the fresh talk.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right.  Because people are in their cars laughing right now and you don't want it to miss what the  next thing you say.  Yeah, let them enjoy the laugh.  Let them get that laugh out.  Died five years ago. 
[00:33:30]  I just didn't know.  Minimum.  Minimum.  He was decaying.  Ah, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Ah.  Ah.  Nonetheless, this is, this is, this is a free country, right?  This is what we built this whole, uh, this whole thing on, right?  This isn't Russia, Danny.  This is Russia.  If you don't write something, don't listen.  He has a right to free speech.  Sure.  He has the right to free assembly.  The assembly would be if you choose to listen to him.  I like you, Betty.  Do you know what I mean?  If you don't, you don't. 
[00:34:00]  I, I, I don't understand.  Equal rights are equal rights.  You know what I mean?  I, I don't march in a straight parade.  One nation under God, right?  Indivisible.  Liberty and justice for all.  That's what I say.  Everybody is everybody.  Everybody is everybody.  You know, this guy makes a lot of sense.  It's just hidden through the babble.  Everybody is everybody.  Everybody is everybody.  That's what you're talking about.  So, Chris, are you, you're happy Imus is returning?  I honestly, as a person, I could care less. 
[00:34:30]  As a, uh, as a whole, absolutely.  Because it, it, it is a good hit to, uh, the freedom of speech thing.  You know what I mean?  He should be allowed to say whatever the hell he wants.  If he didn't have an audience, I guess nobody would have heard it to a bit offender to begin with.  Well, when you get into radio, they basically tell you, you know, just follow the FCC, uh, guidelines.  Hey, you know, it'll be fine.  And, and somewhere along the line, that's, uh, that's not good enough anymore.  You got to worry about special interest groups and, and offending people.  I think it's amazing for, for, for radio broadcasters to worry about. 
[00:35:00]  I think I could sum up what this guy's saying.  I, I really do.  I believe he's saying, look, I might not agree with what you say, but I'll defend what, uh, with my life.  You're right to say it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Oh, shut up.  We have people.  That old cliche.  Hi.  We have people in every corner of the world.  So, if retards can be fucking offended here.  It's her language.  Oh, see that.  Oh, sorry.  That type of language you can't say.  All right, Chris.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Grady in Queens.  Grady, what's up? 
[00:35:30]  That walking cliche.  Hey.  Everybody is everybody.  I just wanted to talk about this whole I'm this thing, you know.  What it comes down to is that comedy is absurdity.  It's not reality.  So, when people try to apply reality to absurdity, it just makes it even more absurd.  Well, it's a good point.  It's like Mentos and Pepsi.  It's this, uh, this phony sense of meaning that people need.  Because people are, people have no control over anything.  So, they're trying to nail comics and entertainers who don't dictate the way society is. 
[00:36:00]  We're just a bunch of dopes who are trying to have fun with it.  Yeah.  Go after the real problem.  You know why nobody makes fun of, like, uh, nobody talks about, yeah, you ever see cancer  walking down the street?  Because it doesn't exist.  So, you look like a dope.  People make fun of racism because it's there.  God almighty.  They go after comedians.  What happens is, uh, what happens is people give power to symbols and words.  It's the thing with the boost.  I mean, right there, little kids might not understand that the symbol is implied, uh, 
[00:36:30]  for hanging black people.  But what it comes down to is that once we start saying, oh, don't do that, that's a symbol  for, uh, a form of racism, then little kids start to identify that symbol.  It's not, it's not a symbol of racism until you give it that power.  And even without the, yeah, that, that is true, but I mean, you shouldn't even have  to qualify it like that or, or, or, or put an asterisk next to it like that.  I mean, uh, there's just going to be things you do that other people think are repulsive  and don't like, and that's, you know, too bad. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Right.  I mean, if you want to put it, you want to walk around the hangman's noose and, and,  and, and say something about blacks, first you should have the right to do it, but don't  get mad when your teeth get knocked out.  Yeah.  Cause that's going to happen.  Yeah.  But I mean, the whole thing of then, uh, the government stepping in and legislation,  what is hate crimes and then just stop.  Okay.  All right, Grady.  Thank you.  A little bit of an observation.  That was our attempt at, uh, you know, talking about a serious issue and, uh, I think they 
[00:37:30]  want poopy jokes.  So we'll go back to poopy jokes.  I miss returns to radio.  Uh, it looks like in early December and this, uh, this isn't, uh, working.  Uh, what is it?  What little button?  Well, we had more, uh, Japanese game show moments.  Oh,  what happened?  Yeah.  It's, I don't know.  Oh, forget it.  They replaced that deck too.  Let me try this desk.  Nope.  Well, in lighter news, yes, the dirt bag who was, uh, seen on sex having, uh, on camera 
[00:38:00]  having sex with a three-year-old girl finally are caught.  Oh, they got him?  Yeah.  He was, uh, pulled over driving without like, like a license plate.  Look, when you're on, when you're on tape doing that, shouldn't you have all of your,  your vehicular stuff in order?  And you're pretty much like, uh, they, they are looking for you.  You are like the, uh, number one guy they're looking for. 
[00:38:30]  Public enemy numero uno.  And, uh, you, you're driving around without a license plate.  A white sedan, no license plates.  And he, he, this guy should just be executed.  In 2003, he groped a six-year-old and he had sex with a three-year-old on camera.  But they got him, that, the guy that was on Good Morning America every five minutes.  Yeah.  He's finally been arrested.  That's weird that he's driving around without a license plate.  No, without, without license plates.  It's like, dude.  Wouldn't you be driving like 55 miles an hour and doing 10 and 2, 10 and 2?  The cops would actually pull me over and go, we just wanted to go, we've never seen a more 
[00:39:00]  legal driver than you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want him to be suspicious because you're driving perfectly.  Yeah.  Not haphazardly without license plates with, uh, major charges pending.  When you watch cops, uh, every so often they'll pull over somebody down south on 95 or something  and, and they were doing like, uh, 85, 90 miles an hour and they get pulled over and, and  then they find just drugs, the trunk full of drugs.  What the hell are you thinking? 
[00:39:30]  55 it.  If you got a trunk full of dope, that's what I say.  That's what I do.  Let's go to Chris in Monroe.  Of course.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey buddy.  Um, hey, don't love the show.  Hey.  Uh, I wanted to, uh, point out the fact of like South Park.  I mean, there's Cartman and, you know, like AKK uniforms and, you know, everything like  that.  And it's okay because cartoons, they're cartoons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've made the point many times in the show.  If you're a cartoon, you can get away with murder. 
[00:40:00]  So we, we attempted to turn ourselves into cartoons.  It didn't work too well.  They didn't buy it.  They didn't buy into the fact that we're actually, uh, the first cartoon characters  doing a radio show.  Yeah.  And it's cool, man.  It's, it's like, uh, South Park should be allowed to, I think it's great.  My only problem with Comedy Central is we don't kind of censor other shows, but not the South  Park.  Like, you know, everything should be doing what Chappelle was allowed to do in, in South  Park and Mencia.  I mean, you should be able to do.  Right.  In comedy.  That's why they're successful shows.  They caught that, uh, you were talking about how they caught that pedophile. 
[00:40:30]  I don't know how, uh, Aerosmith's going to go out without their guitarist.  What a creep.  He kind of looks like, doesn't he look like Joe Perry?  He has a huge neck too.  I think he just like lifts weights with his neck.  He's like, his neck goes like for the outside of his ears.  He's just creepy looking.  From giving so many piggyback rides.  A little creep.  Big strong neck.  The son of a pedo.  Whee!  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  I want to hear from the people that are against the death penalty.  What should we do with this guy?  Let him rot in jail.  Yeah.  It costs more money to kill him than, all right.  I don't think it does.  Just shoot him in the back of the head and get it over with.  It's more fun to say.  Huh?  It's more fun to say.  Yeah, I know.  He was shot in the head.  All right.  Who gives a crap if it costs more money?  Exactly.  Like, that's going to, like, change the whole world.  That's going to, like, change our taxes that we pay.  Yeah.  We'd pay a load anyway.  It doesn't matter.  It costs more to good. 
[00:41:30]  I don't care.  It's money well spent.  Yeah, I don't mind my taxes.  Pay an extra $10 a year and we'll execute guys that have sex with three-year-olds.  Okay, I'll sign up.  I'm in.  How about America picks up the difference?  Like, who wants to pay for this creep's execution?  You would get volunteers all over the world.  I'll pay an extra buck in my taxes.  Who gives a crap?  Just kill this guy.  Get it over with.  Hey, one more play for this.  RPI came up with a fine, fine prize pig sweeper. 
[00:42:00]  We're getting ready to, you know, give away another $1,000.  This is what RPI came up with very recently.  Hi, who's this?  We have come up with the most, the simplest contest you can do.  It's so easy.  Oh, it needs a fancy name.  It's the European Anthony prize pig extravaganza.  Hi, who's this?  Here's the deal.  ONA tell you the sound clip.  They're going to play between 7 and 7.30 a.m. Eastern time.  You'd be the 10th caller at 1-877-212-O-AND. 
[00:42:30]  That's 1-877-212-O-AND.  You better try it right now to make sure it works.  I just wanted to kick that at the right phone number.  And you guys thought we were joking about people being stupid.  I just put a big loser on my head.  I just called the number to make sure that it was the right number for the contest.  I hate you.  If you're the 10th prize pig to call in, you win.  A grand-a-roony.  The cool grand. 
[00:43:00]  A thousand-buck-a-roony.  So then, you'll not only be a prize pig, you'll also be a goddamn Ricky Pulitzer.  All right.  There you go.  RPI explained the contest perfectly.  And even for the people that don't even know what today's sound is that you're listening for,  here's that.  Thank you.  When you hear that, between 7 and 7.30, 10th caller will win $1,000.  We couldn't make it any more simple.  It's simple.  And at this point, Travis, who's working the phones in the other room, will start hanging 
[00:43:30]  up on you.  Because now we've got people just calling randomly.  I like how they had to change the phone number.  Because people were confused at that.  Well, because it was too many.  Too many numbers.  Too many letters that equals numbers.  But it's okay.  Because once you dial the number, you can dial whatever you want after it.  Right.  Jesus.  So that even confused people.  But now, see, look, if you're calling in now, we're just hanging up on you.  Just hanging up on you until we play the sound.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got to go right to the phones. 
[00:44:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jay in Maine doesn't think the guy accused of raping the three-year-old that they finally  caught should get the death penalty.  Jay, what's going on, buddy?  Not a whole lot, man.  Driving to work first thing in the morning.  All right.  What do you got?  What's that?  What do you got?  Let's go.  All right, man.  Listen, I don't think you should send this guy to the death penalty.  I think that's too easy for him.  Oh, that old gag. 
[00:44:30]  Here we go.  Rusty Tunican lid.  Get off easy.  No, no, no.  He ain't going that way, eh?  No?  No.  You feel like he should just rot in jail, right?  What's that?  You think he should just rot in jail?  No, I don't think he's going to rot in jail.  What I think is you should let him sit around and walk around in jail in fear, wondering  what the inmates are going to come up with to kill him with.  You're saying be put in jail for life, but be put in general population and not in protective  custody.  No, I think you should wait and see what the inmate... 
[00:45:00]  Remember what they did with Dahmer?  Can you believe what they're going to come up with for this guy?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I just kind of said that what you said, and you said no.  Like, let him go in general population.  You know, I would love to think like you, Jay, but I just don't see it happening.  They protect these creeps in jail.  And Dahmer, by the way, got killed for cutting somebody on line, I think.  That was a prison infraction inside.  It had nothing to do with...  The broomstick shoved up his edge, as I recall, right?  Well, but it had nothing to do with his...  Yeah, beat the death of the broomstick.  Yeah, it had nothing to do with his actual...  I don't know. 
[00:45:30]  Some guy that rapes little kids ain't going to last more than a day or two in prison.  You know that.  No, Jay, I don't know that because they protect these creeps.  So he probably will last a very long time in jail.  I don't know.  I don't buy that.  I think the guard would easily...  Have you done any research on what goes on in prisons?  They protect these guys now.  They do.  It's not like the old days where you would do something horrific in the real world.  They throw you in prison in general population.  Prison justice.  Why do you think they figured out down the line that they had to start protecting these guys?  Because they were getting offed like crazy. 
[00:46:00]  You honestly think they put this guy in jail and into general population?  I'm just saying, man.  I think the inmates are going to, one way or the other, have their way with them.  I think if you're a guard, you turn your back, you let it happen.  Dude, the bottom line is, I understand what you're saying.  It's not the way it works.  If I'm the parent of the three-year-old that he raped, I'm not going to wait around hoping that's what's going to happen to him.  Jules Steinberg's out.  He beat a little girl to death.  Hey, and Bo, we both want to see this guy die. 
[00:46:30]  He doesn't want to listen.  Hey, Jay, thanks.  Why don't you just have a conversation with yourself looking out a mirror?  I agree.  It would be much better than what we're doing here today.  I don't even disagree with Jay, but what he's saying is naive because they don't really throw you in gen pop, as they call it.  Gen pop.  Because the state is technically responsible if you're killed in jail to protect themselves.  Right.  They separate you into your own.  Once in a while, these guys get killed like someone gets to them.  Yeah.  But, dude, it's not, what do you think it is, 1950s, where they're going to go, hey, we're going after the sex guy, see, and the guards are going to turn away. 
[00:47:00]  Go ahead, get him, boys.  They slip the guard a little something through the bars, and he walks away and doesn't look, tips the brim of his hat with his nightstick as he walks away.  No, this guy will live a long life in protective custody in jail, miserable, but with other guys who are animals like him, other rapists, other pedophiles.  Like a trade stories.  Yeah.  Like that creep in a sling blade at the beginning when he's telling his little story.  J.T. Walsh.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  He was good, man.  All right.  Well, we'll see what happens to this guy, but we'll be talking about this guy for years to come.  He's not going to be dead anytime soon.  Oh, my God.  Well, you just pretty much condemned him to death.  I would be hysterical if, like, Jack Ruby's grandson shoots him or something.  God, I hope so.  That would rock.  He's going to be alive.  Good luck, bro.  We're getting ready to do our contest for $1,000, and it just amazes me on a daily basis how stupid a lot of our listeners are. 
[00:48:00]  And once again, I feel safe saying this because the people that are being offended, I'm not talking about you.  You're smart enough to understand that.  I'm talking about the people that don't even know they're stupid.  The dummies.  The dummies.  You're in on the joke.  Trust me.  They have no clue they're stupid, which makes them really stupid.  Should we call this one?  And, well.  Yeah, she is just.  She's got our number.  Stalker Patty, please call the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:48:30]  I just got a MySpace little note here from Stalker Patty.  She's been with the radio show since no one was listening to us back in the WNEW days, and she's just as dumb as they come.  What a dole.  She writes this.  Hey there.  I want to call in with the soundbite of the day to try to win $1,000, and I have a problem processing the show phone number.  If I dial 866-212-ON, that would be the letter N, all right, 866-212-ON-A, not counting the prefix one, that is only nine digits. 
[00:49:00]  If I spell out the number and put 866-212-O-N-A, that is 11 digits.  A normal phone number has 10 digits, not counting the prefix one.  Can you clear me up with this and write me the phone number correctly?  This has always confused me.  Thanks, Patty.  Patty.  And she's got a picture with the name Patricia. 
[00:49:30]  Patty.  I'm not so much.  I'm at work.  What's up?  We're not even...  Oh, my God.  We didn't even say hi to you yet.  Who are you talking to?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just heard your voices.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I heard your voices, so I decided I better start talking.  Patty, what do you...  Oh, I'm...  What do you not understand about the phone number?  Oh, it has 11 digits in it, and usually it follows the rule.  The area code plus seven digits equals a 10-digit phone number.  But that's okay.  I'm cleared up with my confusion now. 
[00:50:00]  Well, that's wonderful.  But how dumb are you?  Well, I'm not dumb.  No, you're pretty...  The rule says 10 digits.  No, you're pretty dumb.  Like, Patty.  What?  Don't you look at advertisements on TV and in the paper and stuff, and you see a lot of  phone numbers that have more than 10 digits?  Well, I guess I haven't observed it.  I'm sorry.  It just makes it easier to promote your product by coming up with, you know, nice, cute names  for the phone number. 
[00:50:30]  Like, in our case, it's 877-212-O-N-A.  Technically, you don't even ever have to dial the A part of that number, but it makes it  easy to remember the phone number.  Get it?  Like, a famous one here in New York, 1-800-MATTRESS, and they even, like, have a cute little thing  leave the last S off for savings, meaning you don't even have to punch in the S.  But guess what?  If you do punch in that last S, you're still going to get to the mattress company.  Yeah.  It's going to send you off to England.  The same with our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:51:00]  If you punch in A, guess what?  You're still going to get to the show, even though you don't have to punch in the A.  Well, you're absolutely right, because I discovered that on Saturday when I get all my free minutes  from my phone company.  So I did it O-N, just the letter N-A, and I did it with O-A-N-D-A, and I got through on  that because I got the tape recording, so now it's all clear.  Thank God, Patty, because, you know, I'm really happy that you took the time over the  weekend to run the experiment. 
[00:51:30]  That's good.  She did a test run on the weekend when her minutes were free.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I can't afford to use the dollars on it.  Well, no, I understand.  See, what you do is you get up nice and early, and you take a test drive.  Take that number for a test drive.  There you go.  Psychopath.  Yeah.  Dummy.  Now it's all clear to me, and I know how to call the show.  All right.  Well, it's good.  We'd hate to lose you.  Yeah.  You're just one of those wonderful listeners we want to keep forever. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seems like we will, too.  We want more Stalker Patties.  Enough about Stalker Patty.  All right, Patty.  Good luck with the contest.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to try this week.  I could still use a new winter coat.  Is she even allowed to win?  Yeah, she's not.  She's probably not even allowed to win.  You've been part of this show.  Watch this.  No, Stalker Patty could win the contest.  Thank you.  You know.  So, Patty, if you were going to win the $1,000.  Yeah.  I would use $800 for towards my rent and a rent account, and I would take $200 and go get 
[00:52:30]  myself a nice coat.  A rent account.  Yeah.  Do you need a coat, Patty?  Do you really need a winter coat?  Yeah.  The one that I had had a rich lining, and I couldn't keep it, and it's out of date, so  I had to get rid of it last year.  So, this year, I was going to get myself another coat, like a brand new, like a new one.  Right, right, right.  I know what a new coat is.  We'll get you one.  So, you're just sitting there waiting for the queue to call, right? 
[00:53:00]  Well, yeah.  Well, not today, because I'm working, but tomorrow I'll be there.  Right.  Hi.  You're the first caller.  I know.  Hi.  You're the second caller.  Hi, you're the third caller.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're the third caller.  I'm the third caller.  Okay.  Hi, you're the fourth caller.  Hi, who's this?  Did I win?  Hi, you're the fifth caller, sir. 
[00:53:30]  I'm sorry.  Patty, you still there?  You.  I'm still here.  Hi, who's this?  It's Bob.  Hey, Bob, you're the sixth caller.  All right.  Sorry.  Hi, who's this?  Brian.  Hey, Brian, you're the seventh caller.  I'm sorry.  Hi, that's good.  All right.  Still close.  Hi, who's this?  Hello, good morning.  Good morning.  Who's this?  My name is Stu.  Stu?  Stu.  Oh, hello.  Stu.  Hey, Stu, you're the eighth caller.  Sorry, man.  Patty, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  Hi, who's this?  This is Glenn.  Hey, Glenn, you're the ninth caller.  I'm sorry.  Hi.  All right.  Patty.  Yeah.  Here's the winner of the $1,000 today.  Hi, who's this?  Yo, it's Jelly Roll.  Hey, Joey, guess what?  You just won $1,000.  All right.  That's what's up, dude.  Not much, man.  Hold on a line.  We're going to give you $1,000 for knowing today's sound clip.  Knowing today's sound clip was yesterday's clue, right?  Yep.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, my God.  What?  Does he even know?  Wait, do you know what's going on?  Sometimes.  Yeah, so maybe tomorrow will be my turn.  Oh, my God.  Joey.  Don't listen to that babbling ass.  Do you know what's going on today?  Not all the time.  Why are you calling the show?  Because I'm stupid sometimes.  No, why are you calling?  Seriously.  Oh, I'm calling to win, dude.  Oh, be cool.  And what made you call? 
[00:55:00]  Ed Norton.  You got to give it to him.  He made me call.  He said, you got to call.  I was like, all right.  You got to give it to him.  Ed Norton.  Just as was.  But do you understand the rules of the contest that you just won?  Yeah, I know you're kind of goofing, but do you know the actual contest?  A little bit.  I heard the sound clip yesterday.  You wait between 7.30, 7 and 7.30, and you call.  All right, which you did today, and now you have $1,000.  Did you hear the sound clip, and that's why you called, or did you just call randomly? 
[00:55:30]  No.  Well, I call randomly, too, but I heard the sound clip.  Okay.  All right.  Elvis was working.  I was calling him left and right.  All right, hold on a line, man.  Left and right.  All right, there you go.  There's today's winner.  His name's Joey, and he's trying to be a smartass.  Give him $1,000.  I've never wanted to take a prize back.  He annoys me.  Let's just hope he uses it for like a bad dose.  Was his name Joey, or did he say Jelly Roll? 
[00:56:00]  Jelly Roll?  I think he said his name was Jelly Roll.  All right.  It's not even a name.  You can, by accident, hang up on him and take the next caller.  It's not a name.  It's a treat.  What's up?  He calls all the time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's a fan of the show.  All right.  I didn't give him $1,000.  I think he's a little.  He's just being silly.  He's just a douche.  He's a goose.  All right, Patty, we just gave $1,000 away right in front of you.  Yep.  Maybe it'll be my turn.  All right.  So I'll try out this week, too.  I got to get back to work now, okay?  Yeah, that's fine with us. 
[00:56:30]  I'm at Starbucks.  Bye, Patty.  Yeah, we know where you work.  We know where you work.  At speed.  Let's not forget, it's Tuesday, everybody.  I can't believe I gave my parents to a geek.  That's 80s, no way, it's Tuesday.  I met your children.  What did you tell them?  Video games have killed the old star.  Video games kill the radio star.  It's turning Japanese.  I think I'm turning Japanese. 
[00:57:00]  I really think so.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Turning Japanese.  I think I'm turning Japanese.  I really think so.  I don't know that.  Something's seriously wrong with us.  We're soldiers.  But we're American soldiers.  We've been kicking ass for 200 years.  We're 10 and 1.  That's 80s, no way, it's Tuesday.  Jenny, I got your number.  I need to make you mine.  Jenny, don't change your number. 
[00:57:30]  8-6-7-5-3-0-9-9.  9-8-6-7-5-3-0-9-9.  That's 80s, no way, it's Tuesday.  On the LB and Anthony show.  Roland is a star, man.  I had, by the way, I had dinner with Roland last night.  Yeah?  And my chick.  A couple things about Roland.  We had, I did that Gotham thing.  It was Pal Talk.  I didn't know it was a Pal Talk show.  My friend Ray Allen has a little show and Roland came.  And we went out to dinner, meet him and my girl afterwards. 
[00:58:00]  And Roland's brother is coming to town.  And he has a lot of embarrassing stories about me.  So we have to get Roland's brother in studio.  That would rock.  And then my girlfriend got out of the cab and just went home.  What a psychopath.  Why did she?  I don't know.  Because she was going to get her computer.  I was tired.  It just.  Oh, no.  Just.  Wait, you guys are fighting again?  Why wouldn't we be?  Wait, what's the fight over?  I don't know.  We were having a great night.  So you're having a great night and she decides to leave and it made you angry? 
[00:58:30]  We were playing kissy games.  Oh.  Little things.  And then she had to get her computer.  But I was tired and wanted to go home to bed.  And she knew I was exhausted.  And she said, so we're not going to get my computer?  And I'm like, look, you can get it and then meet me uptown if you want.  Because I'll start winding down and going to bed.  But she really wanted to get it.  So I'm like, all right, well, I'll have the cab pull over because we had just left the restaurant.  But I wasn't.  I know probably someone goes, I wasn't saying get out.  I was saying, look, if you want to do it, do it now.  Because I didn't want to hear this all the way uptown and fight.  So I'm like, if you want to grab your computer, grab it, whatever. 
[00:59:00]  And then she gets out.  She's like, all right, fine.  And she gets out and she's walking and she's looking disgusted up at the cab.  And I'm like, what?  And then we just start texting each other.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Oh, my God.  So what's the real problem?  That was it.  I was tired.  And she wanted to go online.  And sorry, I got to get up.  Right, right.  Sorry.  I mean, I don't care.  She shouldn't have to go to bed when I do.  But I wake up very easily.  Yeah.  By the way, they want these clips online for ringtones, especially Club Soda Kenny and Roland. 
[00:59:30]  So I didn't have anything on the girlfriend thing.  That's why I went to the answer for feedback.  I didn't know what to say after that, Jimmy.  I just thought there was so much turmoil in that.  I know.  When they just seem to really be all lovey-dovey every time I see you two.  Every time I see you two, which isn't that much, but it's enough times where maybe one  time should have been a little shaky.  And then all I hear is the arguments.  Oh, it's so irritating.  I bet. 
[01:00:00]  I hung up on her.  Can't take the fighting.  No, huh?  No.  Is it your fault or hers?  Both.  Most of the time?  Both.  Both.  50-50?  I mean, I think I'm probably more responsible for more of the fights, but this one was not  me.  And I'm not saying that somebody needs to do work online that they're wrong to need a computer.  She shouldn't have to live according to my schedule, but it's like, you know, Roland  was finishing his dessert, and I stood up and put my jacket on, and I paid the check.  Like, I was that fast to get out of there just because I was tired.  Right. 
[01:00:30]  It's like, you know I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  So if you've got to get your computer, get it, and then meet me at my place so I can start  winding down and just whatever.  And then she's like, well, yeah, you're up to one o'clock anyway.  What's the difference?  I'm like, ugh.  Why are we fighting?  And then she throws in the fact that I'd never go to her place.  It's just, what are you doing?  Why don't you, though?  Because she lives, it's a walk-up, and she has roommates, which is fine.  I've lived with roommates, but my place would be kind of, it's just me and her. 
[01:01:00]  I would prefer to have the privacy.  That's the only reason.  Yeah, yeah.  Not against our roommates, but I, you know.  That just makes sense.  It's a lot easier.  I mean, if you're going out with somebody and you've got a place to yourself, which, you  know, is a lot nicer, too, by the way, and she's hanging with roommates, that's  just weird.  Why would you go over there, except to maybe pick her up every once in a while, go, you  know, stop in, say hi.  Here's what it is.  And she says it's not on principle, but it's on principle.  She's like, I want you in my space.  I understand that, and I like that.  But it's just a matter of, like, if I want, I'm like, if we can't even argue at your place. 
[01:01:30]  We argued one time, she's like, my roommates are sleeping.  So I'm like, we couldn't even argue.  Not that we should live like that.  But if I want to take a dump, what are your roommates in there?  Yeah.  It's like the little things you want to do, like lay on the couch in your underpants and  just watch television.  Scratch.  Yeah.  There's like little things.  I lived with people, so I know you get little things you can't do.  Do you go over there at all just to pick her up or anything?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Usually I'll meet her out.  I mean, usually I'll meet her at my place.  She comes to my place 95%.  Yeah.  But it's like she gets mad at me and resents me because I don't go there. 
[01:02:00]  And it's like, it's not that I don't want to go there.  I'll pay for your cab to come up.  Yeah.  It just makes more sense to go to your place.  Yes.  In the end, that's it.  Yes.  Which means it has, I don't know.  It seems like it's something else.  It is.  I agree.  She thinks that it's more like she's inconveniencing herself or like I'm putting myself out and  I'm accommodating your schedule.  But it's like, I'm not doing it out of ego.  I'm not saying, come on, toots.  It's just there's no one else here and I get up at five.  That's all it is.  My place.  Right.  Let's go to my place.  Yeah.  But it's not like we're, you know, I'm ball busting and going, no, come to me, cookie. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  When we return, we're going to try to get Hitler's Globe for Anthony.  Yeah.  I really want to make a bid on that.  I think I might bid on it.  You have to bid on it.  I'd like to have it from my office.  Yeah.  Well, it's actually, yeah, we'll talk about that after the break.  We also have the XL catalog we're going to get into next.  Living XL catalog for the morbidly obese.  The obese.  It's just fatties.  Some nice products for the obese people out there to make their lives a little easier. 
[01:03:00]  Instead of losing weight.  And a stick that you can use to use your toilet paper with.  That's wonderful.  They have one of those?  I'm sure they do.  Well, we'll have to look into the catalog and talk about that.  And also the lady that got crushed by the car.  Or was it the lady or the guy?  It was the lady.  The lady got crushed by the car because she was spying on her boyfriend.  She was trapped.  It's a great story.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  You are an obsession.  You're my obsession. 
[01:03:30]  Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me?  You are an obsession.  Ah, it's 80's New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Who the F sang this one?  I think he got me.  This is animation?  Animotion.  Oh, yeah, animotion.  Okay.  Kedia, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you today?  Good, good. 
[01:04:00]  Why are you calling the show?  Why didn't I call the cell?  Why are you calling the show?  Why are you calling the show?  Because they told me that there's a contest today to win $1,000.  Yeah, who told you that?  Someone.  Who's that someone?  Someone.  Someone randomly at our store.  Oh, you have to remember who.  No, I don't actually.  It's just a customer.  Oh, a customer?  So you work at a store, and a customer said, hey, there's a radio station having a contest 
[01:04:30]  giving away $1,000.  Yes.  So you figured, how'd you get the number?  I called up yesterday information.  Oh, very cool.  Where do you work?  In East Windsor.  Doing what?  What kind of work?  What kind of work you do there, darling?  I work at a dollar store.  A dollar store.  So I work at a dollar store, a customer comes in and goes, did you hear what's going on  on the Opie and Anthony show, right? 
[01:05:00]  Not really.  What did they say to you?  He just told me that there's going to be a contest to try to call.  Can I ask, so you're working at the dollar store.  Guy comes in, and he goes, hey, which way do I go to get the thing?  By the way, there's a contest for $1,000.  You should call.  Well, I speak to all my customers.  Very friendly.  Oh.  All right.  So do you listen to this radio station usually?  Sometimes.  Sometimes? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Like, how often would you say?  Well, when my children listen to it, I listen to it.  My husband listens to it also.  All right.  Oh.  And what station are we talking about?  92-3 K-Rock.  Ah.  All right.  I'm not that out of the loop.  And what radio show are you listening to right now?  Well, the Anthony and Opie and Anthony.  Oh, well, I liked it the first time.  The Anthony and Opie and Anthony.  Oh, come on. 
[01:06:00]  Three of us.  There's two Anthonys and one Opie.  All right.  Very good.  And what do they do with their radio show?  The Opie and Anthony show.  What do they do with their radio show?  Like, name one thing they've done on their radio show.  Um, can't say.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  When was the last time you listened to the Opie and Anthony show before today?  Be honest.  I, really, I don't remember.  I don't.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  What do you usually listen to? 
[01:06:30]  To 101.5.  Light FM?  Jazz?  What is it?  The Jersey guys.  101.5, New Jersey.  Oh, all right.  Jersey 101.5.  But now you're listening to us because we're giving away money, right?  Well, they told me to call, so I might.  Prize pig!  Prize pig on the line!  Go away, prize pig!  We don't need you!  Very nice. 
[01:07:00]  Go away, prize pig!  Hang up the phone, prize pig!  We don't need you here!  You still there?  Yes, I'm still here.  Why won't you hang up?  Because.  Why should I?  Had a girl.  All right, you're a tough one.  I have to be.  You didn't, uh, you didn't, you didn't win the $1,000. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  And we're very happy when a prize pig does not win the $1,000.  You are a prize pig!  Oh, prize pig!  So long, prize pig!  So long!  I kind of love those, uh...  What happened? 
[01:08:00]  Prize pigs.  Ugh.  Big fatso.  Speaking of, uh, let's talk about the, uh, Living XL.  The catalog here.  Yes.  Somebody apparently sent this to Steve.  It's, uh, it's a catalog that, uh, is built for, for fatso's.  Right.  It's, uh, there's a lot of things in here to make your life easier.  Um, of course, none of these things would be a gym membership or anything that would help  you lose weight or no tips in here for healthy eating. 
[01:08:30]  Who got this?  Steve?  Yes.  Yeah, we should bring Steve in.  It's a, it's a whole catalog just for, uh, for obese people.  To make their lives a lot easier.  Just, all just conveniences that are going to allow you to keep being the slob you are.  It's almost like if you're an alcoholic and, like, they just, instead of saying don't drink,  they just buy you, like, a padded hat so if you fall, you won't bang your head on the 
[01:09:00]  floor because your hat is padded.  Right.  How about quitting drinking?  We're getting Steve in studio here.  Petra, what's up?  Not much.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Why are you calling the show today?  I'm calling for the contest.  I could use $1,000 for gas.  For gas?  For gas.  We, we.  It's some drugs and alcohol.  Who, uh, who told you to call right now?  Nobody told me.  I listen to you guys every morning.  But, but are we doing the contest right now? 
[01:09:30]  From 7, 730, right?  Yeah, well, it's like, um, 736.  736?  Wouldn't that mean the contest is over?  I guess so.  Right.  Well, sometimes people run late.  But you say you, uh, listen to us every morning, so wouldn't you have heard that we gave away  the money?  We did that whole thing live on the air a mere minutes ago.  Actually.  Yeah, no, well, I'm stuck in traffic, so I was trying to get through. 
[01:10:00]  So, because you were stuck in traffic, you figured what you heard on the radio wasn't  real, so I might as well call?  Well, yeah.  Well, I've been trying to call for a week now, well, since you guys started it.  What's your favorite part of the Opie and Anthony show?  My favorite part of the Opie and Anthony show?  Um, I don't know, I like your guests.  You guys are looking funny with your guests.  I like the, um.  Like, who did we have on recently?  Um, when you guys were doing the, um, rap stuff and you guys didn't know anything about  rap music. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, that was about a month and a half ago.  Mm.  What did you hear, uh, this week so far?  Well, I missed it yesterday, so so far this week, today was the first day.  All right, how about, how about last week?  Well, last week was the rap guy, because I was driving to Boston listening to that.  Rap guy.  It was Monday or Tuesday last week.  Yeah, yeah, the rap guy.  Last week.  Terrific.  All right, Petra, I don't know why you would call, because we gave away the money, which 
[01:11:00]  is kind of strange that you would continue calling.  Did you assume we had more money to give away today, or?  Well, no, I've been trying to call, so I didn't even know I was going to get through.  So, I get through.  That's cool.  All right, Petra.  Good luck to you.  All right.  Bye.  We're not going to beat you up too bad for being stupid.  Hang in there, though.  You have another chance to win $1,000 tomorrow.  Uh, by the way, we need a sound clip for tomorrow.  Ant, you got one over there.  Uh, boy.  I didn't even give much thought to it. 
[01:11:30]  $1,000 on the line, and a sound clip to...  Oh, yeah.  We were thinking of this one.  Another one.  Very simple, short, sweet, and lovely.  That's it.  That's tomorrow's sound clip.  That's tomorrow's sound clip.  When you hear that...  We'll play it again.  When you hear that between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow,  if you're the 10th caller,  877-212-6263. 
[01:12:00]  We'll make it even easier.  That's the actual phone number.  877-212-6263.  And it is the same as 877-212-O-N-A.  And that sound, by the way, is a clip.  It's audio of an otter being raped.  When you hear that between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow,  if you're the 10th caller,  you will win the $1,000 courtesy of Opie and Anthony, okay?  Steve, what's up with this catalog you got?  Got an email from a guy in Minnesota 
[01:12:30]  who told me about a fat person catalog he had  and would I like to see it?  And I said, absolutely.  And it showed up yesterday in the mail.  And we were all having a good laugh  at some of the products  that are made specifically for morbidly obese people  in this catalog,  which are not modeled by morbidly obese people.  No, they're just kind of a little husky.  The fattest one I think they have is Mr. Suspender's guy.  He seems like he's got a lot of back.  Yeah, Mr. Suspender's guy. 
[01:13:00]  But most of these people are just on the verge of fat.  Because they want you to think you're going to look normal  in these products.  That you're a human being when really you're not.  You're a brontosaurus.  Exactly.  You should have a tail so you can swat flies off your back  because you can no longer reach.  Fat people don't need a 35-inch long leg-lifting nylon strap.  Yeah, that's one of the items.  Wait, what is it?  It's, look at the 1, 2, 3, 4, 4th page of photocopies.  Okay. 
[01:13:30]  You'll see a 35-inch, yeah.  It's a nylon strap that you use to lift your...  It's called the leg lifter, Hopi.  It's 35-inch long.  And this heavy-duty, semi-rigid nylon strap  has a stirrup that allows for lifting and positioning feet.  Eliminates bending.  Yeah, you wouldn't want to bend.  Forget about that.  The leg lifter helps movement into bed, a vehicle, or a footrest.  Once seated, the leg lifter can be used to reposition one or both legs. 
[01:14:00]  The upper end of the leg lifter forms a hand grip  for one or two of your fat-handed use.  35 inches long.  So you put the one strap around your foot,  and then on the other end of this thing, you pull your leg up.  Well, it's like when you want to go to, like, say you want to get in the car.  Because you have to drive to McDonald's.  So what they do is they open the door and they collapse into it.  They just collapse into the car. 
[01:14:30]  And then, like, the one foot...  Through the momentum of this planet falling into a car,  the one fat leg kind of swoops up and in.  But then the other leg is left out there.  Now, whereas most erect walking creatures would just lift their leg,  this person cannot.  So they pull out the handy leg lift and they scoop it on their feet  and then they lift, hoist up, which I guess constitutes exercise,  and then they swing their foot into the car and close the door 
[01:15:00]  and then drive to the nearest disgusting fast food restaurant  and eat until they're in the car.  I was right there with you, man.  I have a suggestion, though.  Instead of spending money on this leg lifter, just use a loaded shotgun.  You put your toe in the trigger and then you pull on the barrel  and it will lift your leg up for a couple of seconds until, of course, it fires  and then you're no longer a burden on this planet. 
[01:15:30]  A leg...  The second you need something to lift your legs up, just because you're fat,  I can understand, you know, maybe somebody's paralyzed that they use this,  but just stop eating.  But just the idea that it says here, eliminates bending.  Yeah.  Like when you're looking for products, if you're like,  God damn it, how can I stop this bending nonsense?  Oh, all this god-awful bending.  Lifting my leg to the couch.  What the hell am I going to do?  Awful.  With all this time I save. 
[01:16:00]  How about just a forklift for the apartment?  How about that?  We have a union guy on a tiny, thin forklift come over  and lift your fat feet onto the sofa  and then we go to the fridge and grab your lunch.  And they can just land you on the bowl, too.  Carry over to the bowl.  Exactly.  All you got to do is put your arms out  and the forklift will scoop you up  and then another union man will come over  and yank your fat pants down  and he'll drop you on the toilet.  And then when you're finished,  they'll tip you face first into the tub and run the shower 
[01:16:30]  so you don't have to worry about reaching with paper.  Moving on to the next product here.  Speaking of toilets.  Speaking of toilets.  That's why we're jumping ahead here to the Big John Toilet Seat.  It's the Big John Toilet Seat.  Oh, but you're looking at a toilet with a 1,200-pound capacity.  I'm not quite sure if that's for sitting on it  or what you leave in it.  But it is a 1,200-pound capacity.  This unique ergonomic design. 
[01:17:00]  And by ergonomic, let me explain what they mean.  The toilet seat actually has wings on it.  I'm not kidding you.  Picture a toilet seat and where your hips would be,  where your cheek fat would be.  There's wings to help support that extra, extra fat.  So that's what they mean by ergonomically designed.  Features a contoured 1,200-pound capacity seat  larger than any other toilet seat in the world. 
[01:17:30]  The universal design works with any round or elongated toilet.  Features include heavy-duty constructed,  formed from solid, high-density, anti-microbacterial epoxy resin,  stainless steel hinges,  and wide, non-slip bumpers to prevent lateral sliding.  How much lateral sliding is going on?  They're blasting themselves right off of this thing. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, we got Doug.  He's a little mad.  Doug, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm just wondering why you guys are bashing fat people  like more than usual today.  Because we are looking at this particular thing.  What do you mean more than usual?  Well, you guys are usually, you make it, you know,  like you used to do the Fatty Pig Fatty contest and whatnot.  You know, the fatties love the Fatty Pig Fatty contest.  When we did it in Cleveland in front of a live audience,  we had a lot of women marching up the aisles  to get in on the contest. 
[01:18:30]  They couldn't wait to get on that stage  and show off their fatness.  And we're going to bring that contest back soon, by the way.  I'll tell you why.  Fatty Pig Fatty 2 coming to the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  Dude, I'll tell you why we're talking about fat people.  Because this LivingXL catalog comes,  and this is not people who are born big.  This is basically just co-signing for behavior  that is just increasing your obesity instead of,  you know what I mean?  That's all it is.  It's saying, here, be fat and don't worry about it.  And we're not to,  this is the only thing we're making fun of fat people for. 
[01:19:00]  The contest pig thing doesn't mean fat.  Pig doesn't mean fat in that case.  I thought the contest was kind of fun and, like, you know,  it was silly, but this just kind of seems like...  How fat are you, Doug?  How fat are you?  Oh, I'm a 280, I'm 6'3".  Now, well, I don't think this catalog is talking to you.  Yeah, no, this is...  This isn't about me.  Oh, it's about your chick?  Do you need a Big John toilet seat in your life?  Do you need... 
[01:19:30]  I need a Big John toilet seat.  I spend the money on getting the lipo, so I wouldn't...  Thank you.  Do you need a strap to put on the end of your foot  so you can pull that foot into a car?  No, I don't.  Like, the strap is...  I do like their large robes.  The strap is three inches long.  Three feet long.  Huh?  Gotta admit that their robes are very appealing.  Guy my side, it's hard to get a robe that fits.  But you don't...  Just use a comforter.  I don't want to use a comforter.  And, Doug, do you need a straight-handled, no-bend toenail clipper? 
[01:20:00]  Let me explain what this is all about.  This is so, like...  At this point, you should just know there's a problem.  Yeah, this is...  I mean, if you don't need this, then this catalog's not talking to you  and you should have fun with this bit with us.  This thing is actually 18 inches long with a toenail clipper at the end of it  and it has, like, a...  It's like a caulk.  Like a caulk gun.  Caulk, it looks like a hacksaw without the blade in it. 
[01:20:30]  Right, and it has that caulk...  You guys are sounding a lot more aggressive than usual on them.  You know what?  We can't do this bit with you.  I was trying to...  You're just staying up on them.  Bye, Doug.  So it has a...  Yeah, it's a hacksaw without the blade  and then it has the caulk gun, like, trigger that you would use  when you're caulking your bathtub or whatever.  And when you pull the trigger,  18 inches down the thing here is your toenail clipper.  And you can clip your toenails.  And I'll tell you, Doug, why we're a bit more aggressive.  Because last night I'm out to dinner 
[01:21:00]  and you know what?  I had to eat fruit.  I don't want to eat fruit.  I want to eat cake.  You want to eat cake.  I don't want to eat salmon.  And fatty stuff.  Of course I do.  I've got to tell myself no.  You know what I started doing to try to keep in shape?  I live way up there.  I took the stairs the other day.  Forty floors.  A little insane, I know.  Trust me, I know.  It's good exercise.  But it's great exercise.  It's like doing, like, Stairmaster at the gym.  Like, I didn't feel like waiting for the elevator.  And this was after being on an exercise bicycle for a half hour. 
[01:21:30]  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to walk back up to my apartment.  Forty stories.  I'd rather do the Stairmaster at the gym.  That hallway gets a little monotonous.  And you get a little dizzy.  And you've got to go round and round.  That's just it.  A little dizzy and a little woozy by the time you get to the top there.  But that's why, Doug.  That's simply why.  It's like, I'm an addict.  So I understand addictive behavior.  Believe me.  I want to eat cake so bad.  I hate fruit.  I'm eating dry egg whites on a boring bagel. 
[01:22:00]  And I'll throw half the bagel out today.  That's what I'm getting.  Egg whites.  You make a commitment to try to eat healthy and then keep yourself in shape, or you don't.  But I mean, when it gets to this point where you're ordering a straight-handled, no-bent  toenail clipper to clip your own toenails, there's a problem.  It's a catalog that accommodates lack of control.  Yeah.  And that's what you guys are making fun of.  And I'm making fun of just the...  Believe me, I am.  And believe me, I...  The Chinese are coming.  They don't have these things.  No. 
[01:22:30]  Only in America.  I hate lots of fish.  We're just a fat country.  The wide-ass bicycle seat, over six times larger than a regular seat.  Over six times larger.  At that point, why don't you just take the seat off?  You won't even feel it.  That's because if you ever see a real fat person on a bicycle, the amount of flab of  ass cheek that hangs over the edge of the seat is astounding.  And first of all, you barely see them on bicycles. 
[01:23:00]  That's what's weird.  This is probably not a big seller.  Is anybody that weighs 500 pounds riding a bike?  Biking in the circus.  Some type of circus act.  They have something that will keep the ball from falling off your nose while you ride  the bike in a circle.  Can I say that I like the fact that at least Doug called in, though, and spoke his mind  and he didn't like it?  No, sir.  I don't like it.  Good for him.  Yeah, he got a little angry.  Whatever.  At least he talked normal and wasn't yelling.  500-pound bike seat. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, a bike seat.  It's a big, cushioned bike seat that looks like the part that your butt sits on is about  five times wider than a regular seat.  It just says, you have a big, fat ass.  How about this?  How about just putting a little recording inside a regular bike seat and every time you  sit on it, it goes, oh!  Ow!  P-U.  And then you got your airplane seatbelt extenders.  Well, you know that it's very embarrassing, fat people, at the airport on airplanes. 
[01:24:00]  They get very embarrassed and very offended when anyone brings anything up.  If they're sitting in the seat next to you and some of their fat is going over the arm  rest onto you and you comment on it, you're the bastard.  You're the ass, you're insensitive, you're this, that, the other thing.  It's very embarrassing when they have to ask for a seatbelt extender to get around that  fat belly. 
[01:24:30]  Like, in the event of a crash, they're not going to just end up like a pumpkin that some  young vandals got a hold of on Halloween.  Just splattered with their innards like seeds on a street.  And so they figure they bring their own, it saves them the embarrassment, along with  the Buzzknot leather travel belt.  Oh, what's that?  And the Buzzknot suspenders.  You might say, what the hell could that be? 
[01:25:00]  These are oversized, obviously, belts and suspenders with no metal on them.  Because it seems fat people, when they have to take off their belts, their pants are falling  down at the airport.  So now they can walk right through without having to worry about it, because there's  no metal on these.  Plus the whole belt thing.  Who needs that?  You have to put a boomerang on one end and throw it.  Circles.  Let's go to Fat Boy.  Fat Boy!  Fat Boy!  Fat Boy! 
[01:25:30]  What's up, Fat Boy?  Hello, fellas.  I just want to celebrate E-Rocktober and say, what the F?  Yep.  What the F?  You guys are making fun of fat people.  So what the F?  Deal with it.  Oh, you're, are you, but see, you're probably not fat.  I am, though, actually.  Oh, wow.  This is unusual.  Oh, you're saying we should deal with it or fat people should deal with it?  A fat guy actually understanding that we're just trying to have a little fun at his expense.  I like this.  How fat are you, Fat Boy?  I'm six foot, 290 pounds of pure lovin'. 
[01:26:00]  Do you have a...  I love this guy.  Sounds like a comic book guy on the Simpsons.  I love this guy, though.  But you don't have a straight-handled, no-bend toenail clipper, do you?  No, I just gave up cutting my toenails.  There you go.  Do you have a 500-pound capacity scale at home?  Well, most scales go up to what?  How much are we?  300, maybe?  300, yeah.  Well, you could get a scale that goes up to 500.  And they also have special scales that go a little higher, like 550, that comes with a remote control, because guess what? 
[01:26:30]  You're so fat, you get on the scale, you don't know how much you weigh because you can't see the numbers.  So they solved that problem for all you fatties out there by giving you a remote control so you can hold it in your hand and see how fat you are.  All right, Fat Boy!  Thank you.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love you, love the show.  Hey, man.  Isn't there kind of a fatal flaw with that leg strap thing? 
[01:27:00]  Don't you have to, like, bend your leg to actually lasso it around your ankle so you can lift your leg?  No, it's probably like dipping something, like at a carnival, like when you're trying to fish something out of a tank or whatever.  You probably just keep dipping it and pulling until you realize you have a toe.  They also have molded sock aid.  It minimizes bending and reaching, molded plastic sock tray, and soft molded pull cord handles that are 33 inches long. 
[01:27:30]  It's like a little sleeve, a half pipe with two ropes connected to it.  You slide your sock on it, and then you put your foot in it and pull the cords because, God forbid, you're able to bend down and put your own socks on without the help of some sort of machine.  It sounds like being in hell, like having to live like this.  It really does.  There's button things. 
[01:28:00]  If your fingers are too fat to hold the little buttons and you can't reach the buttons, there's these little wooden things with loops and hooks on them to button your shirt.  It's a nice catalog that enables your fatness.  You become something that isn't even functional as a human being anymore.  You can't dress yourself without machinery.  Why lose weight if you got a toenail clipper that extends 18 inches to cut your toenails with your fat feet? 
[01:28:30]  Can you just imagine the Fritos, the Frito corn chips that go flying out of that?  And then, excuse me, how are you picking up the toenails that fly all over the place when you're using this?  Do they have a toenail picker-upper?  Do they just leave those orange, yellow Dorito-colored messes laying all over the living room floor?  And it's like, can we call the operator?  Here's the phone number. 
[01:29:00]  Let's get her on the line immediately.  That's what we should be doing today.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ryan in Brooklyn.  Ryan, what's up?  Ryan?  Yeah.  Every time you call the number to order something, the operator should just say, stop eating fatso.  Well, the problem is this, dude.  Get a little fatso.  This is not even about banging on fat people because it's almost like I don't care what people do if they're crap.  Like if fat people got on a plane and go, look, I know I'm huge.  Give me two seats.  Because those seats are not even built for like regular skinny people.  They're terrible.  Yeah.  And they didn't mind paying for two seats.  Like, yeah, I know I eat too much. 
[01:29:30]  I'm taking up two seats.  I wouldn't care.  Be as big as you want to be.  But it's like they start to get mad at people for resenting their addiction inflicting on you.  And that's what bugs me.  Did you say regular people, Jimmy?  How dare you?  Regular.  Who are you to judge what's regular?  Regular.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Fan.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mark in Connecticut.  Mark, what's up?  What's up, boy?  It's morning.  Hey.  Morning.  What's up?  It's morning.  Is there anything in that catalog that, um, like a, like a tone, like a tone out clipper 
[01:30:00]  thing?  Um, for their, like a shovel or something that'll shove the spoon in their fat mouth?  Lisa in Boston.  What's going on, Lisa?  We're going to be up there a week from Friday for the Halloween party.  What's up?  Nothing.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Just calling because, uh, you know, I think it's absolutely disgusting that this magazine  exists and, uh, fat people really need to take responsibility for themselves and, uh,  need to lose weight because, honestly, I'm sick of sitting next to them on the subway and 
[01:30:30]  not being able to sit down because they're taking up two seats and, uh, they need no help  to be fat or they should have magazines that tell them how to actually lose weight instead  of being fat, disgusting messes.  I guess it's their choice to be fat until it affects us.  Absolutely.  Us normal, regular people.  And it affects our health costs and stuff like that.  It's like smoking.  And Marlon Spurlock raised a brilliant point in the McDonald's thing he did about how people  are so quick to chastise you for smoking, not even for the public health, but for your 
[01:31:00]  own health.  Yeah.  And yet, if you see somebody eating like that, that's what the problem is.  I don't care if you affect yourself.  Like this woman, we're trying to get her on the phone, Sandy Schaefer, she's the head  of the New York chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Fat Acceptance.  Are you kidding?  They ripped off the, uh, the NAACP's beginning there?  Yeah.  The National Association for the Advancement of Fat.  Like the problem is us for not accepting it. 
[01:31:30]  You know, and there is such a thing as a secondhand fat, like smoke, with the kids.  You ever see the fat mother walking around with her fat little kids because she's got  all that fat food sitting in her fat house?  How many kids have been taken away by a fat mother who's fattening up her kid and hurting  his health?  I'd love to know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, our goal is to piss off the fat organizations out there, so then they  picket the radio station, and then all of a sudden they lose weight and go, oh, I guess  we've got to get rid of this organization.  They wouldn't picket.  They'd use some kind of a fat catalog picket machine, or they'd just roll around like Captain 
[01:32:00]  Christopher Pike in that stupid wheelchair.  They'd probably have enough money to hire Olympic athletes to just picket 24 hours a day  without getting tired over and over again.  They just lay in front of the target area like a bunch of sea lions with signs taped  to them, and you have to step over them.  Let's go to Nick in Missouri.  Nick, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Listen, the reason why us fat people are getting aggravated today, and listen, I've been fat 
[01:32:30]  my whole life, struggled back and forth, up and down, but I want to tell you, it's just  because this isn't really funny.  Like, today isn't funny.  Like, you're not coming up with any, Jimmy has the same old tired argument every time  he talks about fat people.  But doesn't that tell you, hold on, dude, hold on.  Doesn't that tell you that it's, we are making jokes and laughing about, but the tired argument,  but it's a valid argument, right?  Well, no, I honestly don't think so, because whether or not they have a nail clipper isn't 
[01:33:00]  going to change fat people's attitudes about their weight.  Oh, wait.  I don't have a nail clipper?  Oh, no.  I better lose weight.  Like, fat people are willing to walk around smelling like, you know what?  Right.  Well, you know what?  You say it's not funny, but I think it's funny that we just found a product that is  18 inches long that cuts your toenails.  To me, that's hilarious.  Lifts your foot up onto an ottoman?  You didn't like my line about, you said we're not trying to be funny.  Of course we're trying to be funny.  I talked about fishing around until you hook a toe. 
[01:33:30]  You didn't think that was a decent line?  No, I agree with Opie on this, that these instruments are hilarious, because at first  when you mentioned it, I said to my wife, hey, you know, we better get this.  Maybe it'll help me out.  I mean, I'm only 325 now, but I mean, I was 440 at one time.  I go, but now that he's listening to you say this stuff, these products are ridiculous.  I just, I just wish it was a little, I've heard the same stuff over and over with this 
[01:34:00]  one issue, I guess because I'm fat, it's hitting home.  Okay, but it's like my argument about like what bugs me about fat people, I'm not attacking  you in a self-righteous way because I'm an addict, so I get the thinking.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, dude, I understand what it's like to want to eat like that because I'm a compulsive  psychopath.  Do you know how much money I've spent on whores?  I don't blame, honestly, I don't blame anybody else for my sexual behavior.  Like I don't put it off on society.  I don't inconvenience society.  I just do reprehensible things and I got to take the hit for it. 
[01:34:30]  Dude, I agree with you on that 100% because I'm a fat guy and when I'm walking through  a crowd, I'm always saying, excuse me, in a self-deprecating manner, I always tell people,  oh, excuse me, I take up much more room than I have to.  And you know, I'm cool about that.  And I agree with the airplane stuff.  I just, I just, I just, why don't you lose weight?  He has.  He's lost 120 pounds already there, Nick?  Yeah, I'm down 120 pounds.  Have you been fat your whole life?  I was fat. 
[01:35:00]  And then from the age of 17 to 28, I was a bodybuilder and a powerlifter and I was in  excellent, unbelievable shape.  And then it's just, I have an obsessive compulsive thing.  And when I get like, if I have bad problems in my life, right away I turn to food that's  my best friend.  But I definitely get that.  And that's why I'm not being self-righteous.  But I'm saying if I, if I have to deal with it and take the hit myself, I can't be mad  when other people get pissed off if my addiction affects them.  That's all I'm saying, man. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not saying that you're a bad person.  If you eat too much, I don't care.  It's your body.  Nick, do you?  I was saying that.  Are you working on your addiction, Nick?  Excuse me, sir?  Are you working on that addiction thing where if you have problems in your life, you'd turn  to food?  Are you seeing someone for that or?  Well, I haven't seen a psychiatrist.  My, my psychologist did put me on Well Putrin to help me with my obsessiveness.  Right.  And I just don't like it.  I just don't think it's, it's right.  I really need to find out.  I mean, I'm an Italian guy.  I was brought up in Brooklyn and they used to always tell me no matter what happens to 
[01:36:00]  you in life when you're brought up in an Italian family, it's eat.  Oh, you're hurt?  Eat.  You're happy to eat.  Nick, did you ever try, there's meetings for anonymous groups about over-eaters, compulsive  over-eaters, like 12-step programs.  Did you ever try one of those?  Because they get to the root of the problem.  It's not just about food.  It's like, you know, that's just the cover-up.  It's a symptom of a larger issue that is not, that you're-  Larger issue.  Yeah, sorry.  You're trying to fill some kind of void and you're filling it with food.  Some people fill it with booze, hookers, drugs, whatever.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll give that a shot.  But anyway, keep laughing about fat guys. 
[01:36:30]  I guess I was being too picky because I just didn't think it was funny.  That's all.  Yeah.  Well, now I don't feel like having fun with this anymore.  Oh, I certainly do.  You made me very sad.  I do.  Yeah.  Sorry, guys.  I'm a happy guy.  I don't think I'm one of those sad, fat people.  I'm enjoying my life.  You watch Biggest Loser?  No.  I'm a truck driver.  I'm on the road.  Oh, you should DVR that one, man.  That's an amazing show.  It's amazing what they do with these guys and how much weight they get them to lose.  Absolutely amazing.  But then again, they put them in a camp for three, four months where they don't have a 
[01:37:00]  job or family responsibilities and someone's watching them 24 hours a day.  But it's a pretty amazing show.  You should check it out.  Well, I didn't mean to bring you guys down.  Well, you did.  Yeah.  We're all sad now.  Good luck, Nick.  All right, Nick.  Let's say hi to Lisa in Philly listening on YSP.  Lisa, what's up?  Hi.  How are you guys?  Good.  What's going on?  Hey.  I listen to your show all the time.  I just think it's a disgrace that they even put a catalog out like that. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, there's Weight Watchers.  There's Jenny Craig.  There's, you know, just stay under like 1,000 calories, 1,500, and you'll lose the weight.  Yeah, it's really, now I'm all bummed out because talking to Nick, I'm like, I feel  a little bad.  Oh, don't worry about him.  He'll just eat.  Feel better about himself.  No, Nick's all right.  Guys, I'm sorry.  I do believe that food is an addiction.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  That people, it's an addiction for a lot of people.  Oh, now we're all sad.  I know.  No.  We really are a bunch of, here's what we are on this show. 
[01:38:00]  We're big mouths.  And we're hypersensitive little sissies who are easily cowed by one person being hurt.  I just realized that our jokes hurt people sometimes.  They certainly do.  Oh.  They do?  But you look at a guy like Steve who's a big, big dude and got stomach stapling and  then spends a lot of time in the gym and he worries about his diet and he's like, I'm  sure you don't want to do that crap.  No, not at all.  But no one does.  Yeah, nobody does.  It's like you or Ope or anybody that watches what they eat. 
[01:38:30]  And you measure what's more painful.  Is being fat more painful or is working out a couple hours a day more painful?  Yeah.  All right, Lisa.  Should we take a break?  Yeah.  We're all sad.  Yeah.  We're going to make fun of Down syndrome next to make ourselves feel better.  Absolutely.  Then we're going to tie it up with fat retards and go home.  Jane in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  Well, we're now sad.  Oh, who cares?  We hurt some people's feelings today. 
[01:39:00]  We're bullies.  We're just bullies going after easy targets, I just realized.  I know.  And now we're all going to go run out to Dunkin' Donuts and eat some more, huh?  Notice we haven't even made one joke about what's-his-name getting arrested on gun charges  because we're scared of him.  Yeah.  What?  T.I.?  He's scary.  He's really scary.  We saw him when we were down in Washington, and we would never joke about that because  that's a scary one.  We can just go after the easy targets on this show. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, well.  I want a good laugh, so I'm going to go and order that catalog.  All right, Jane.  Bye.  Let's go to Matt in PA.  Matt?  Matt's trying to help us out here.  Yes, Matt?  Yeah.  I mean, my big problem with fat people is the smell.  If they can't cut their tone, it's how they're wiping their butts.  Maybe they should use, like, bed sheets.  See, I would have laughed at that a day ago, but now I feel bad.  I know.  I just feel like that's got to be hell to be in.  It really is awful.  It just has to be.  Despite all the addiction and the fact it's a choice, what an awful way to have to live. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Tom in Philly listening on YSP.  Tom?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Tom.  Does that magazine have extra strength, fat person, deodorant?  See, they're trying to bring us back.  I know.  They want us back in, but...  I'm trying to come back in there.  It's just not...  I just don't feel too good about myself right now.  I don't either.  Yeah.  Because we have a lot of fat listeners, and we don't want you to think that we don't like you.  We do like you.  We don't, but... 
[01:40:30]  No, no.  We like you at a distance.  All right.  We just don't like you on our foot in a crowd saying, excuse me.  Let's have a plane next to us.  Thank you, Tom.  Let's remember that words do hurt.  Words hurt.  They certainly do.  Words hurt.  Words hurt.  I wish some CBS lawyers were here to straighten us out.  And sit us right down and help us.  All right.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show with a couple of other things.  The lady getting crushed by the car.  That's hilarious.  And it ties right in with fat people.  And we have more products from the fat catalog, hopefully. 
[01:41:00]  I hope so.  A few more we can look at?  Yeah.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ozzy?  Yuck.  No.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Jim Norton, the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't forget, Jim Norton's HBO special, available on DVD today.  Thank you, man.  Yes.  Today, right?  It does come out today on DVD.  There's DVD extras and extra material if you like the special.  Go out and purchase it, and I'll sign it when I see you. 
[01:41:30]  You did a fine job, and people should pick that up if they haven't seen it yet.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Very good.  We got fat people all over the world calling in right now.  All over the world.  They should be heard.  Let's say hi to Laura.  A-T-R-D, I mean.  Laura, I assume that you're a fat person.  So, Laura?  Yeah, hi.  Was I wrong to assume that you're a fat person?  No, I'm not a fat person, but I am a recovering addict.  And this actually goes to Jim.  I love you.  I saw your HBO special. 
[01:42:00]  You're phenomenal.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  But I just have a question.  Do you have empathy when somebody would make fun of a recovering addict who might fall off  the wagon or someone's being attacked?  But I seem to remember you in the YSP days.  You had a little bit of a gunch, you know, a weight problem.  Sweetheart, let me interrupt you.  You're right, and I do have empathy.  And my awful body has been the source of so much self-hatred for me, and I have been relentless 
[01:42:30]  in attacking myself for it.  It's not like I sit here and make excuses for myself and go, well, I look kind of good.  Like, when my neck is fat, I look at photos of myself, I want to bite my own face.  Right.  So I have no empathy for myself, much less anybody else.  But yeah, I know what you mean.  And I wish I was a little bit more spiritual and I had more empathy.  That is a flaw.  I'll agree.  Okay.  And did I win?  That joke is funny.  Charles in Indiana, what's up?  Hey, man. 
[01:43:00]  I'm about, I don't know, about 345, but I absolutely agree with y'all guys.  You know, the thing is, this whole attitude where being fat, trying to turn into a disability  in America, it's stupid.  It's something that you could control.  It's not a disability.  Nick DiPaolo had the funniest line, and he's done it, I think, on TV.  So Nick, if I'm doing your line, Nick DiPaolo, who's just caustic, is talking about the American 
[01:43:30]  Disabilities Act, including fat people.  And he goes, it's not a disability.  If you're missing a limb, you're disabled.  If you're missing a cheesecake, you're full.  I've never heard a better, more slicing line for how ridiculous it is to be considered  a disability.  It is.  Well, how come fat people are calling now?  They're raining on our parade.  They're calling to say that, go ahead, make fun, right?  They're sweating on our parade.  Some of them.  Charles?  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Hey.  You say you're fat, and then we should continue making fun, right?  Yeah, I'm about three, I'm like 6'1", 325, but I know it's because I like to eat, not  the...  All right.  We're losing it.  Thank you, sir.  If people were the...  Or not.  Or...  Or...  Like, where you guys were kind of...  Okay.  I like talking to his belly trucker.  I mean, to me, that just makes me want to lose weight.  Oh, boy.  All right, Charles.  Thank you.  Enough about the fat people.  Sharpton was on the Today Show.  In other news today, Imus is coming back to radio the first week of December. 
[01:44:30]  And what did the Reverend Al Sharpton have to say about Imus coming back?  Does he have a right to come back?  I think we have to see where the arrangements with Citadel are in terms of contracts, in  terms of how they're...  What?  Does he have the right to come back, Al?  What business is it?  In America, does Imus have the right to go back and do his radio show?  That's the question.  Very simple.  What business is it of this ass to ask what is in Imus' contract? 
[01:45:00]  First of all, it's confidential what goes in people's contracts, you dumb oaf.  He can't...  He can't...  What does he think?  He's going to get a copy of it so he can go over it?  We're going to have to see what's in the contract.  He's going to go over it with a fine-toothed call.  How about we go over your tax records for your stupid organization?  Yep.  You lying sack?  I can't stand this guy. 
[01:45:30]  With Citadel, in terms of contracts, in terms of how there will be a safeguard against his  continuing a pattern in his career.  What do you mean we have to see?  You want to be part of that negotiation?  No, I think National Association of Black Journalists is the group of blacks in...  Oh, the separatist?  You mean the separatist organization that wants to separate journalists by the color of their  skin?  You know, black journalists separate from white journalists to look out for the best interest 
[01:46:00]  of black journalists?  So it's completely separate and biased, only based, completely based on skin color.  What the...  What are you people thinking?  Assimilate Christ on a pony.  It's really irritating.  The black journalist organization is enraging because by the nature of it, they have to keep  fighting or there's going to be nothing for them to do.  It's such an agenda-driven thing just to be called that.  Just to have that name for your organization, it means you have an agenda. 
[01:46:30]  And for a journalist to do that, who is supposed to be open-minded and supposed to look at a  story unbiased and to have that put in a black journalist, instantly, whatever you write  is going to be biased.  Of course it is.  The group of blacks in broadcast and print are the ones that got my group, National Action  Network and others involved.  They've asked to meet with Senator.  We'll see if that meeting occurs. 
[01:47:00]  I think that he assaulted not only this basketball team, he assaulted all women and all blacks.  Assaulted.  Dude, he's using words like assaulted.  What the hell is going on with this country that this jackass gets to spew his venom whenever  the hell he wants?  And it's serious.  And it's serious.  It's not comedy.  And comedians are being crucified.  I'll tell you who got assaulted. 
[01:47:30]  The people in Freddy's who were killed after you had been there complaining about the white  interlopers and stirring up people.  Do you remember when you incited a riot?  Yeah.  That was an assault.  Only this basketball team assaulted all women and all blacks.  And I don't think any broadcaster can put a timetable on somebody else's insult level.  So Citadel did not meet with these blacks.  He's right, though, because, I mean, I shouldn't make fun of that. 
[01:48:00]  Yet Steve Harvey, who I like, should be able to do the hillbilly news.  Of course, which is assaulting people from the South and white people, as this is assaulting  all women and all black people, he said.  He is speaking again for all you black people out there.  He just said that that was an assault on you, because he said all women and all black people.  So all women and black people.  Reverend Al is now representing all of you and speaking out on your behalf. 
[01:48:30]  How about the black journalist write something about R. Kelly and the video?  How about that?  How about the black journalist write something about why does black culture embrace this  guy when we've kind of seen the video and we know what he does?  Why is he still on the charts?  Maybe that's something they could write about instead of what a 60-something-year-old white  guy says in a passing moment in humor.  Yeah.  So if Citadel did not meet with these black journalists, are you saying you would recommend  that the advertisers boycott the radio show? 
[01:49:00]  If they don't meet, we can only assume that they have a reason not to be forthcoming.  And that they are different than the broadcasters that stood up and said, wait a minute, we're  not going to misuse our advertisers' dollars or our airways.  Why wouldn't they meet?  If Mr. Imus was sincere when he said several months ago he was sorry this is wrong, then  why wouldn't it be forthcoming?  They should be asking for the meeting if they were sincere.  Oh, shut up.  No more meetings. 
[01:49:30]  Shut up.  No more meetings.  Meetings, sh-meetings.  No more meetings.  I cannot stand this guy.  Oh, do I hate Reverend Al Sharpton.  God damn, shut up already.  Get out of the public eye.  For God's sake, enough of you.  People are sick of you.  You're making things so much worse between white and black people.  You don't even...  Is that your purpose?  Because if it is, you're doing a bang-up job. 
[01:50:00]  You're making things worse.  You're separatist.  You're racist.  And he's profiteering off of it.  Oh, God, is this guy disgusting.  Just a disgusting human.  Knowing Fareed, no one's going to tell him what to do.  Well, we work for a bunch of Citadel stations.  Yeah, we know Fareed.  Fareed will probably...  Fareed will tell him to go F himself, and I hope he does.  He'll probably humor a few of these groups and actually meet with them, 
[01:50:30]  but none of these groups are going to tell Fareed what to do with his company.  Fareed is arrogant.  Yeah, he is.  He's very arrogant.  He's going to handle this a bit different than Imus' old employer.  Fareed knows what he wants,  and he's not afraid to do what it takes to get it.  You know, he's a ballsy guy.  Here we go.  The final clip.  That'll just set Anthony...  Oh, man.  We're at a very serious point in American history 
[01:51:00]  with hangman nooses all over the country.  I'm testifying the day before Congress.  All over the country?  All over the country.  All over the country, there's hangman nooses.  All over the country?  I counted two.  There was one in a tree in Gina or Jenna,  however you want to pronounce it,  that they found out had nothing to do with the assault that happened  on the white student that was down there.  The nooses had nothing to do with that. 
[01:51:30]  It was another episode.  And then the one that was on a door of a teacher in,  where was that, Brooklyn?  Columbia University.  Columbia University, that's, yeah.  Two nooses is all over the country.  He wants to sensationalize everything  to make everyone think Reverend Al is needed.  Reverend Al needs to put his cape on  and fly over somewhere like a superhero  to help out the downtrodden poor black people. 
[01:52:00]  No one wants to hear from you anymore.  That's not true.  They're throwing them on TV left and right.  Yeah, you know who wants to hear from them?  The news.  The news loves putting this jackass on  because they know it riles people up  and it makes people watch the news.  Swastikas are on temples all the time,  meaning that there's just racist dirtbags in the country  who do stuff like that.  It's not headline news every time a swastika shows up on a temple. 
[01:52:30]  It's gross.  Yeah.  Hopefully they catch the pig who's doing it,  but it's not headline news.  Right.  I heard Ronnie talking about that yesterday.  I didn't steal that from him.  Ron Fez.  No, but he was talking about that sometimes graffiti  is just graffiti.  It's not meant as a hate crime.  It's not this calculated thing.  It's just some jackass kids with a spray paint can  and no imagination making swastikas or racial epithets 
[01:53:00]  or whatever the hell it is.  And now it's front page news.  It's front run on the broadcast news.  What the hell is...  Why?  And I say the media is making that worse  because now there's a lot of kids out there going,  everyone wants to be that YouTube.  I can make the news.  They want to be the YouTube star.  They want to be on the news.  They want their, like Andy Warhol said,  their 15 minutes of fame.  So if you're a kid and you're like,  man, how do I get a little action here?  Oh, wow, they're reporting on swastikas all over the place.  I'm going to do mine.  I'm going to do mine now.  The day you think a swastika or a racial epithet 
[01:53:30]  scratched in a wall in a bathroom stall  or written in Sharpie or a pen or whatever  is a hate crime,  you've completely lost your mind.  There are things written on bathroom walls  when you're sitting there and bored.  It is really just a cornucopia of Americana  in a bathroom stall.  You can go cross country.  I think somebody did a book on that 
[01:54:00]  and just took pictures of certain sayings  and found what was more prevalent  in certain parts of the country than others.  It was pretty interesting.  You know what they learned?  There's a lot of hate for the vagina.  Yes.  And a little bit of love for it  because there are a lot of pictures of it.  But number one, people love the male, you know,  genitalia to draw on bathroom walls.  Right.  All right.  Here's the final clip. 
[01:54:30]  You know what they should worry about  instead of like the nooses?  How about you testify about gang signs  being everywhere you go?  Oh, my God.  How about that's the graffiti  and that's what you should be worried about  is the fact that I can't make a public phone call,  which I wouldn't anyway because of the germs,  and I'm fancy and I have an iPhone.  But why would you when there's gang signs?  You can't go anywhere without gang signs being all over the place.  How about that?  That's a great point.  Gang signs are a lot worse  than two nooses hanging anywhere 
[01:55:00]  because gang signs are people saying,  I'm going to kill you.  There are deaths that are related to gang signs  and people putting graffiti over gang signs.  Yeah, it's a lot more dangerous.  And then the background,  you ever see a news story up in the Bronx  or in Harlem, certain bad areas of Brooklyn,  when they get the people in the back of the shot  and all they're doing is flashing gang signs with their hands?  Why not talk about that? 
[01:55:30]  I have a picture with Snoop.  Of course, I groveled and got a shot photo with him.  And what's he doing?  Throwing up a gang sign in it, which is fine.  I mean, I would do the same thing if I was in one,  but no gang will have me.  And I'm not even saying it's wrong,  but don't be self-righteous and complain like that  about the nooses, which are gross.  Go after the gang signs.  It's because he's a racist,  he's a race baiter,  he's a separatist,  and he's a profiteering jackass. 
[01:56:00]  It's a living doing this.  Here's the final clip.  We're at a very serious point in American history  with hangman nooses all over the country.  I'm testifying the day before Congress  about Gina in the middle of that  to bring back a man  who made an obvious racist and misogynist remark  and said, we're not going to talk about it.  But he has apologized,  and even if the team accepted his apology.  And if the apology is serious,  then he would act in accord with his apology.  If he and his new bosses don't, 
[01:56:30]  then one has to wonder,  was the apology just another press release?  But why does he have to meet  before he even goes on the air?  He apologized,  he's going back on the radio,  and then if you think he's this racist guy,  then I guess it's your right  to do what you're going to do,  which we don't agree with.  Well, why does he have to meet  before he even does his first radio show?  He already apologized.  Sharpton's a pig,  and he's a phony,  and if they were going after the gang graffiti 
[01:57:00]  and they were saying,  that's the real problem,  I would have some respect for him.  But they don't.  And you don't hear the black journalists  harping on that every 20 minutes.  No.  And if they say,  well, that's not what the news covers,  well, then be a little louder  and the news will cover it.  Oh, God, it's disgusting.  Now, Reverend Al is going to be in charge  of meetings that corporations take,  and if they don't take them,  then he's going to again.  Now it's not even a free speech thing.  People say when they hear something on the radio 
[01:57:30]  that they have the right to boycott  or protest the advertisers or something.  Now he's strong-arming  or trying to strong-arm Citadel, ABC,  into having a meeting,  and if they don't meet with them,  he's going to go after advertisers?  What kind of mob tactics is that?  That's what the mob does.  It's a means of extorting. 
[01:58:00]  Unbelievable how he gets away with this crap.  People are really getting sick of it.  Really getting sick of it.  Well, hopefully they are.  I don't really see it that way.  I don't see them getting sick of it yet.  No, I think they are.  I think a good sign is Imus getting rehired,  and I just really hope  that Farid just doesn't give one inch  to this racist race baiter. 
[01:58:30]  He'll humor some of these groups  and meet with him,  but none of these groups  are going to tell Farid what to do.  We know that much.  We know.  We know Farid pretty well.  Yeah.  I hope Imus gets hired.  No one's going to tell him  how to run his company.  And then does terrible in the ratings,  obviously.  I'm not going to say  I want to say I want to say  I want to number one.  We are dummies  pushing for him to get rehired  and be a competitor.  Compete with us.  You got to.  Of course.  You got to.  His demo's a little different.  All right.  We got to take a break. 
[01:59:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right.  A couple things  before we get out of here.  We're going to play  What Did We Learn  on the Opie and Anthony show.  If you got one,  give us a call.  Also, we want to play the sound  that you have to listen for  for tomorrow's contest.  You have a chance  to win $1,000  if you hear the sound.  You got it in.  When you hear that tomorrow  between 7 and 7.30, 
[01:59:30]  that'll be your next chance  to win $1,000.  Once again, this sound.  All right.  And give us a call  877-212-ON-A.  When you hear that tomorrow  between 7 and 7.30,  10th caller will win  the next $1,000.  And now everyone's calling.  But all right.  Maybe they're checking  on the number.  A couple other things.  Kid asked Giuliani  about aliens attacking.  Oh, I saw that clip.  Yep.  And also,  Hitler's globe  is going up for auction. 
[02:00:00]  Hitler's globe.  Yeah.  Do they have an estimate  on what they're going to get?  No, let's find out here.  Well, you probably didn't know it,  but a very rare piece  of World War II history  has been sitting in Oakland  for several decades now.  It is hitting the auction block.  And as Alan Martin shows us,  the winning bidder  will literally own  Adolf Hitler's view  of the world.  His view of the world?  Deutschland  ist nun aband.  No one would argue  Hitler's...  Can I please say,  this is the beauty 
[02:00:30]  of the news  and how they languish  in redundancy.  Does anybody need  to be brought up  to speed  on who Hitler was?  Like,  do they have to  assault every  bit of your senses  by showing you  a Hitler clip?  Like,  is there anybody going,  who?  Hitler?  Who is this guy?  Well, we'll show you  who this guy is.  Oh,  some stock footage  of Hitler, right?  Of course.  You don't need it.  Of course you don't need it.  No one would argue 
[02:01:00]  Hitler saw the world  differently,  but right after  Hitler's world  came crashing down,  his mountain retreat  called the Eagle's Nest  was bombed  and the Fuhrer's  personal globe  was rescued  from the rubble.  And then here's  this globe  right on the table.  Nobody's there,  nobody whatever.  91-year-old  John Barsamian  was the man  who grabbed it.  For 62 years,  the globe has been  in John's house  in Oakland.  He showed it  to close friends  and his family  knew the story.  Now the world's  hearing the details 
[02:01:30]  as the globe  goes up for auction.  John says he thought  about giving it  to a museum,  but not being a millionaire,  quite frankly,  he wants some money  for it.  Money is not,  I mean this seriously,  it's not that important,  but sometimes  you need it  to pay some of the bills.  And a collector  will get a view  of the world  some would consider  priceless.  The auction for that globe  begins November 13th  in San Francisco.  The globe is expected  to fetch somewhere  between $15,000  and $20,000.  I'm in.  I am in.  I want Hitler's globe. 
[02:02:00]  Well, how do we  make that happen?  I don't know.  Find out how you bid on it.  How do I bid on it?  That would be great.  That would look great  in my office.  It would just be one big,  like the whole thing  is probably redone  just so it all says Germany.  Yeah, just like  everything's scratched out.  Yeah.  United States of Germany.  Yeah.  Great Germany.  Big X's.  Afro-Germany.  That idiot.  Afro-Germany.  Well, Germanica.  So you're going  to bid on that? 
[02:02:30]  I would bid on that  in a second.  $15,000 or $20,000?  They're probably  going for a lot more than that.  Yeah, I know,  but I'll see  what I could get.  Maybe I could get $25,000.  I'd pay up to  $50,000  for Hitler's globe.  What?  It was taken right out of  his, uh...  Then what?  They have this thing  and then what? 
[02:03:00]  I put it in my office.  But no one's ever  going to see it.  Except you.  Exactly.  And his girlfriend  when she walks in  at three in the morning  and he's nude  staring at us  with the moonlight  hitting his face  mumbling.  She'd be like,  Anthony, your lips are moving.  Like, oh, I'm just  talking to myself.  Spinning the globe.  Yeah, spinning it slowly.  Like that,  she'd be upstairs  and she'd go...  What could have been?  I...  All right, well,  how do you bid?  How do I bid  on Hitler's globe?  I'm sure somebody 
[02:03:30]  out there  will help you out.  How come they don't,  by the way,  do that for other stuff?  Like, they have  Hitler and they have  to show stock...  Like, how about  a rape was reported  and they show  stock rape footage?  Yeah, it's really  a crime.  It's like a huge crime  was committed  on the entire world  and now they just  auction his stuff off.  But they show him  in the background.  Like, you wouldn't  be quite sure...  Hitler, do they mean...  Was it Adolf Hitler?  Is it Adolf Hitler  or is it...  Was it Pete Hitler,  the guy from Schenectady  who I had that run-in with?  Yeah, because I know  he had a globe. 
[02:04:00]  I remember seeing it  when I lived across  the street from him.  Might be his.  What is that?  Oh, they're  playing the footage.  Okay, okay.  They mean World War II  Hitler guy.  Well, when they describe  9-11,  they'll still...  These obsessive,  compulsive ninnies  still feel it's necessary  to go when the nation  was attacked  by Islamic terrorists.  We know.  Yeah.  Who doesn't know  what happened?  Yeah.  And if you don't know  by now,  you don't care anyway.  Yeah, you're a fool.  You just don't care.  Or you're one 
[02:04:30]  and you can't read  the paper yet.  Did we find that story  about the lady  that got crushed?  We gotta do that  before we get out of here.  I don't have it  in front of me.  It's right here,  my sweet.  Alright.  What's the deal?  Woman spying on husband  gets trapped under SUV.  This is in Pittsburgh  where we used to be on  and we're no longer.  Rescue crews freed  a woman trapped  under a sports utility vehicle.  She said that  she thought her husband  was cheating on her  so she went to spy on him  and by crawling  under an SUV  outside of his  alleged girlfriend's house. 
[02:05:00]  This is the beauty of it.  She apparently fell asleep  under the vehicle  and became trapped  after someone  let the air  out of the tires.  Come on.  How beautiful is that?  Like,  not only are you spying  to see if he's having sex,  you doze,  how tired are you  when you doze off  under an SUV.  How do you find that?  And then you can't hear  while you're sleeping.  How do you find that boring?  Exactly.  You're spying on your guy  that he's with his chick.  She must be up late.  You're married to the guy 
[02:05:30]  and you're bored to tears  where you're going to fall asleep  under an SUV  as you're spying on him.  And then not only,  you don't feel it slowly  being lowered onto you.  One tire,  unless they had four friends  all simultaneously  feeling the air out of the tires.  Yeah.  You had to go  left rear,  right rear,  left front.  One tire at a time.  You don't feel it  caving your chest in?  A little pressure.  Oh God,  is she wonderful.  Did she die?  No.  Unfortunately.  No,  they got her out.  I'm not sure  if she was being crushed by it 
[02:06:00]  as much as  once the air was out of the tires,  she couldn't get out  from under it.  Like she was trapped  underneath it.  I'm thinking,  the husband  or the girlfriend  or something  saw her,  was onto it.  Someone might have called,  said,  hey,  you know,  there's some woman  underneath the SUV  in front of your house.  And then they went to look,  realized she's asleep,  have a little giggle,  and then go,  what can we do?  Wouldn't it be great  if we could just 
[02:06:30]  take the tires off of this thing  and let it drop on her?  Probably not even that.  They just want to trap her  underneath the vehicle.  No,  but at first,  the conversation is  it would be great  to just pull the tires off  and let it crush her.  And then you think,  why don't we just  take the air out of the tires  and trap her under there?  Yeah,  they're not looking at  criminal charges  for the people  that let the air out.  The couple has been married  for 26 years.  The woman  who was under the SUV  was taken into custody  to undergo  a mental health evaluation.  Nothing about the people  that might have  let the air out of the tires. 
[02:07:00]  No.  They probably decided,  you know what,  she's a kook,  she's doing some crazy things,  we got her now,  why don't we trap her  and then call the authorities?  That's probably what happened.  Let's say hi to Kelly in Jersey.  Kelly,  what's up?  Dude,  a pleasure.  I can't even begin to tell you,  but I learned today  that Jimmy Norton's girlfriend  is my boyfriend.  Oh,  same type of argument?  No,  it's simply because  I have lived alone 
[02:07:30]  and have loved it  for 16 years  in the same place.  And he's got dogs,  he's got a niece,  and I don't want to be there.  Dogs and a niece?  Wow.  You prefer your own space,  just kind of quiet,  just you two.  Exactly.  So you live alone,  so it's just easier for him  to come over to your pad.  Exactly.  I kind of see it that way,  I understand that.  But he doesn't get it.  He wants me to come there. 
[02:08:00]  I don't want to be there.  But he thinks it's personal,  and you're like,  no,  it's not about you  kowtowing and coming to see me,  it's just here we have privacy.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Alright,  there you go.  Maybe me and you should hook up.  I learned today  that for a chick,  I'm more like a guy.  That could be a good thing.  Maybe me and you hook up.  How about this?  She's a good guy.  We dump these two baggages  that we have  and me and you hook up.  How about we go to each other's  silent, lonely apartments  and just look at each other. 
[02:08:30]  He's got a life and family  and she's got roommates and friends.  I haven't seen your show yet,  but I've got it on tape  and I'm looking forward to it.  Or you can pick it up on DVD today.  I would say you buy it on DVD.  This way you can carry it around  and point to it  and go,  look at the Norton DVD  and people will go,  God,  that's great.  Can I come to your empty apartment  and watch it with you?  No dogs,  no nieces,  no nothing.  Alright, Kelly.  Thanks for listening.  Love you guys.  I love you.  Bob, Jersey,  what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, 
[02:09:00]  I learned today  that a fanny can't take a joke.  I don't know.  I think most of the...  Yeah, some could take it  and others.  Heavier folks took in stride.  Sure.  Others felt hurt today.  Nick in East Northport,  what's up?  What's going on, man?  I learned today  that if you want Hitler's Globe,  just bring $51,000 to the auction.  Yeah, exactly.  You should probably  never name your price in an auction.  Maybe not.  That's where the auction starts.  What an awful mistake that was.  Not on national radio.  There you go.  Thanks, Nick.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what did you learn 
[02:09:30]  on the show today?  What's up, guys?  I learned today,  judging by the items  in that catalog,  that fat people  are just continuing  to get fatter.  Fat people are continuing  to get fatter.  Yeah, that catalog  is kind of...  It takes away  any exercise they might get.  Hey, by the way,  the guy who got  the Hitler Globe,  didn't anybody question...  Like, it's not exactly  like it was a map  that you could fold up.  A globe is a big,  round thing  you're just lugging  through like a military zone.  Back in the old days  of World War II,  they brought back 
[02:10:00]  so much stuff  from Europe  and stuff that  you could not  even imagine  bringing back now.  Live,  like grenades,  they'd bring them back.  They'd box everything up  and ship it  to their house,  to their home,  for their family  to hold onto  until they got back.  Just,  when they  hit Germany,  they went  into everywhere,  grabbed silverware,  flags,  huge statues. 
[02:10:30]  I mean,  just  crate it up  and ship it home.  Yeah.  He shipped it home  and actually  took some damage  because the sensors  split it open  to see if there's  anything  down here.  Oh, they split it open?  Oh, so it's a damaged globe.  It's glued together?  There's a hole in it, too.  A hole in it?  Yeah.  Wow, they had  a perfect killer's globe  and they split it  looking for what,  like a pinata?  Couldn't you just shake it?  It's a globe.  What could he be  sending in?  Cotton candy?  Or, you know,  a half-blown-up balloon?  What could he have 
[02:11:00]  put inside a globe  that you wouldn't hear  when shaking it?  And it's Hitler.  And what's he doing?  What's in here,  golf balls?  No, it doesn't sound good.  Right, we'd better  open it up.  Jerome, Boston,  we're going to be there  for the BCN Halloween party  in a week,  in a week and a half or so.  What's up, Jerome?  Hey, guys,  I've learned it's not fair  to point and laugh  at fat people  when they can't  get on roller coasters.  And Adam Twelves on next.  Adam Twelves on next  on BCN.  And I have something  for you, Jerome.  Go Sox, go!  Let's say hi to Brian  in Illinois. 
[02:11:30]  Brian, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Brian.  Yeah, I learned  if you misdialed  the guy's phone number,  you get a phone sex number.  Are you kidding?  Hell yeah,  877-712-ONA.  It's a good time.  Why would you punch...  Let me look at my phone.  Why would you punch  a seven instead of a two?  Why would you?  It's not even close.  Yeah.  You're just blind.  I think you're kind of  stretching here  for the show.  No, no, I'm not.  Why would you punch  seven instead of two? 
[02:12:00]  I'm driving down the road.  I'm a truck driver.  I missed out  going down the road  and that's what I got.  I thought it was a prank  from you guys.  You're a sweet man.  I realized, no,  it was a legit number.  All right, you just gave  them a lot of business today.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Tom.  Just wanted to comment on...  People are really dumb nowadays.  I can't stand it.  Just your contest  and everything,  I can't get over it.  Well, he's very disillusioned  with humanity  because of our show.  Well, you make a good point. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, every day...  That's stupid.  We're still explaining  the easiest radio contest  ever invented.  Yeah.  Except for the fact  of maybe just saying  call now  and we'll just give...  You know,  maybe that's what  we have to do next time.  Just say,  call this number now.  That would...  They'd have problems  with that, too.  They would be confused  by that, too?  Because they are confused  because I think right now  they're calling  because of the example  you just gave.  And that's why  I stopped myself  because if I went further 
[02:13:00]  with that example...  Yeah, you'd have to.  I'd be out some cash  because the lawyers  would go,  look, dude,  you told them to call.  You said it.  Even though I was just  trying to make an example  and now I have to,  like, you know,  pay off the people.  Kurt, Pennsylvania,  what's up?  Fat people need loving, too.  You are correct, sir.  God bless the fatties.  That's what I say today.  Thank you, Kurt.  Thank you, everybody.  We'll see you at XM.  If not,  go Sox go  and have yourself  a great day.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:13:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  on XM 202.  The virus.  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Radio, radio, radio.  I got scared  because I had my,  I put my headphones on 
[02:14:00]  and I didn't hear anything.  Yeah.  And I couldn't rip them  off my head quickly enough  because I thought  it was going to come on  full blast really loud.  Yes, but no,  the volume was Dane.  It was Dane.  Can I have a pen  because there's nothing  set up here  when we come over.  Yeah, what happened  today, E-Rock?  Nothing is set up.  Uh-oh.  That's what I want to hear.  What happened, E-Rock?  Why wasn't anything  set up today, E-Rock?  Why wasn't anything  set up today? 
[02:14:30]  Nothing is set up.  E-Rock, comment.  Comment.  We had a bit of a technical problem.  What?  We had a bit of a technical problem  that we're taking care of.  What was that?  Something during the CBS portion  of the show got damaged  so we're trying to repair it  for the replay.  What?  So we can wait, I guess,  as far as the live broadcast goes?  Yeah.  I thought so.  Can't you do that  after we're done?  Yeah, the replay  isn't until, like, noon.  You got a few hour leeway on that.  We have maybe a minute leeway here. 
[02:15:00]  Well, why didn't you assign  one of them to the interns  to just lay stuff out?  Because they can't.  Oh, I should have done that, yes.  Well, now we're not prepared.  Delegating responsibility.  But it's more important  to make sure something  we already did  is ready for a replay.  All right.  I get it.  Oh.  Oh, E-Rock.  There he goes.  Oh, now he's cursing  under his breath.  You know he is.  You know he is.  All right.  Anything under his breath  is going to suffer.  Hey, what? 
[02:15:30]  I was on the couch over there.  What's up with Randy Rhodes  and what is happening?  Well...  I sort of was half listening there.  I was checking out something.  It is amazing.  And people give me shit  because I attack liberals  and it's amazing.  But you are a liberal.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  A lot of people are saying  that you're a liberal now.  I love that.  It's amazing to me  the mindset  of some of these people.  Randy Rhodes,  apparently she's a good radio host.  I've never heard of her,  but people say  she's really good  at what she does.  She's on Air America,  a very liberal host. 
[02:16:00]  And she has a partner,  I guess,  John Elliott.  So according to  Air America Radio,  Rhodes was beaten up.  She got pretty beaten up,  losing several teeth  and will probably be off the air  for the rest of the week.  She was walking her dog  on 39th Street  and she was attacked.  And there's no press accounts,  I guess.  So Elliott,  I don't know if he's a co-host  or just another host.  I shouldn't say,  I don't know who he is.  How is there no press accounts  on something like that?  I don't know.  Hold on.  I've listened to Randy Rhodes 
[02:16:30]  a few times.  She actually,  I don't agree with a lot  of the stuff she says,  but she puts together  a pretty good radio show.  She's good to listen to  as far as if you're into  listening to radio shows.  God damn rich country.  A couple things.  John Elliott is the  late night host,  I guess.  Oh, it's not her co-host.  Okay.  Because I don't think she's,  unless they moved her slot,  she's not on late night.  So I'm just assuming  it's just someone else  from Air America,  like, you know,  going off on what happened  to Randy Rhodes  in New York, I guess.  She was probably walking  her dog late at night. 
[02:17:00]  That she was.  Which is like,  I mean,  New York City is a much safer place  than when we were growing up,  but it's still pretty  effing scary  later at night.  Late at night,  yes, it's not a nice place.  You can't go everywhere.  There's,  like, you could be on one block  and it's fine.  You take a cross street  and go to another block  and that block isn't fine.  You just gotta know the areas.  And she got beaten up.  It wasn't just a mugging.  Elliot, this guy,  this very in touch  with the way things are,  John Elliott,  was extremely agitated 
[02:17:30]  when he reported  on the incident.  He opened the show  by saying,  it's with sadness  tonight to inform you  that Randy Rhodes  was assaulted last night  while walking her dog.  Pointing out that Rhodes  was wearing a jogging suit  and displayed no purse  or jewelry,  Elliot speculated,  this does not appear to me  to be a standard  grab the money  and run lugging.  Is this an attempt  by the right-wing hate machine  to silence one of our own?  Are we threatening them?  Are they afraid  that we're winning?  Are they trying 
[02:18:00]  to silence,  intimidate us?  Is he trying to say  that perhaps  it was a right-wing  Republican conservative  that went on  a little mugging spree?  What was it?  Rush Limbaugh  in a hobo suit?  A hobo.  Dressed as like  a typical old hobo.  Like,  you have the stick  with the hanky  on the end of it.  I would love to know.  Hey, look,  is it a possibility?  Sure.  Anything is possible. 
[02:18:30]  But the odds are,  I'm not saying  the mugger was a black guy,  I don't know,  but it probably was  just some late-night  kook scumbag  who saw this white lady  walking and either  wanted her money  or didn't like the fact  that she,  maybe he thought  she was privileged  and just wanted to attack her.  The idea that it's  a right-wing  hate machine attack  is fucking childlike.  Yeah,  to jump to that conclusion  and throw out  all the other options  that it could have been, 
[02:19:00]  you know,  the ones that  completely make sense  is idiotic  and knee-jerk.  Like,  I love how logical  he is with,  he does his police work,  he says,  she had no purse  or jewelry,  does not appear  to be a standard  mugging.  So that's logic  he uses.  So the next step is  right-wing  hate machine attack.  Like,  I don't understand  that the idea  that this was just  a kook  who saw this white lady  and wanted to beat her up. 
[02:19:30]  Likes assaulting people.  Yeah,  and he might be  another white guy  who did it,  I don't know.  But why wouldn't  that occur to you  before a right-wing  hate machine attack?  Yeah.  If they wanted  to kill her,  they would kill her.  Meaning,  if the government  wants to kill you,  they'll kill you.  Right.  Yeah,  they poison your food,  everyone knows that.  They could kill me,  they could kill any of us.  Right.  Chances are,  it was not  the Bush administration  who beat her up.  Or Rush Limbaugh.  Or John Hannity.  She's gonna be  jogging tonight.  Or going out  and jogging soon 
[02:20:00]  with the dog.  I'm gonna put you on it.  Punch her in the face.  I don't see  the right-wing  Republican conservative  hate machine.  Anyone that says  hate machine  is an asshole.  Yeah.  Even if you have  a machine  that is specifically  built to spew out hate,  if you've constructed it  and it just yells out  racist epithets,  if you call it  a hate machine,  you're an asshole.  You're talking about 
[02:20:30]  a real hate machine.  That you built,  that you said  there's not enough hate.  I would like to  bottle it  and spew it at will.  I'm going to build  a machine that does that.  Call it something else.  Yes.  You bring up a good point.  You've heard hate machine  many, many times  over the years, right?  What would that machine be?  I think Jimmy  described it pretty well.  Just some kind of,  it's got like  pulleys on it  on the outside  and it shakes a little  when it runs.  It goes like,  all right,  but what does it do now? 
[02:21:00]  And then it just spews out  bad language.  Just bad language?  Yeah, it throws out  the N word.  Well, according to him,  what's a hate machine?  I'm going to guess  any white guy  saying something  that isn't groveling  and guilt-ridden  would be considered  a hate machine.  That's a hate machine.  But that was a logical  step he took.  She didn't have jewelry.  Okay, no purse.  Chances are,  not the standard grab.  Right way,  hate machine.  Hate machine.  A white man  in a suit and tie  beat her up.  What are you talking about, dude?  Would the hate machine  be as tough as a robot? 
[02:21:30]  Because if you're hearing  what it's spewing,  you're going to want  to punch it.  You want to make sure  the hate machine  survives a good beating.  Yeah, you would probably  have to have it  made of titanium.  Titanium, all right.  To withstand a punch.  We're working on  the ultimate hate machine.  Jimmy started this,  but I think we could  go a little further with it.  And it just yells  hateful things.  It has a boxing glove  on a spring arm  that punches people of color.  Does it have, like,  neon lights on it?  Yes.  That's why you know  where it is.  It just says hate.  Does it have just  obnoxious, like, lasers? 
[02:22:00]  To get your attention first.  Just, like, strobe lights  so that bothers you, too?  I would like the idea, too,  that it just has  a stencil cut out  of the side  so it can back up  to a building  and just stencil swastikas.  It's got little stencils  that can rotate  and spray paint  pictures of nooses.  I think it dips  its robot butt  into paint  and it just so happens  to have the outline  of a swastika  on its bottom.  Yeah, just somehow.  And it just backs up 
[02:22:30]  at the walls all day long.  When it's clinsome.  When it can't find  any people to spew  its hate.  Hate speech  out of the hate machine.  Because if you're going  to make the ultimate  hate machine,  it's got to be just  hating 24 hours a day.  It's a machine.  Whether there's people  around or not,  it's just got to be  doing just hateful things.  Why make a machine  if it could do  the same thing  a person can do?  You know,  a person can do that,  but it's got to sleep.  Somebody's saying  that Randy Rhodes  is black.  First of all,  if she's black,  man,  she's the lightest  black person.  She's even lighter 
[02:23:00]  than our own Sam.  She couldn't be black.  Maybe the white guy  that beat her up,  I don't know.  Dave in Michigan,  what's up?  Hey,  you guys got it wrong.  Randy Rhodes is black.  I'm looking at  a picture of her.  If that's black,  man,  wow,  then I'm  kook to kink day.  Well,  on her radio show,  she tells everybody  she's black,  woman.  Does she say it  like Bill Clinton  said he was  the first black president?  No,  no,  no,  no, 
[02:23:30]  no,  no,  no,  no.  She's not a black woman,  sir.  I wouldn't put her past  this idea  that it's a conspiracy  because,  boy,  she...  Dude,  stop it.  She's not black.  She's not black,  right?  Dude,  she's not black.  And if it was a conspiracy,  conspiracy,  chances are  they don't just do  late night muggings  and punch you  in the face  because if,  like,  one...  Remember years ago  when the Atlanta  child killings were  happening,  people thought it  was the Klan  and the FBI said,  no,  it's not the Klan  because if they  were committing  hate crimes,  they allow you  to know what  they're doing  to get their 
[02:24:00]  message across.  If she was just  beaten up  and somebody  ran away,  how would that  indicate to her  that it was  from the Republicans  or the conservatives?  You understand  there'd be no  message sent?  What the point is,  though,  she can get  people fired up  because she just  throws fact  after fact  after fact  when all the  right wing  of the conservatives  call and say,  oh,  this ain't right,  this ain't right,  and she just  throws fact  after fact  after fact.  I kind of like  the way Sean Hannity  does.  I've seen it  go both ways.  Yeah,  she's probably  very good  at what she does. 
[02:24:30]  I heard she does  a good show.  Sean Hannity's  also brilliant,  does a great show,  and can hit you  with fact  after fact  after fact.  There's people  on both sides  who do good shows.  I like listening  to Sean Hannity  and I like listening  to Randy Rhodes  every once in a while  on XF.  But sir,  don't you think  it's more likely  that in New York City  she was probably  mugged by a guy  who wasn't thinking  purse or jewelry,  just saw a lady  at night  and wanted to get  her money?  A busy target,  simple as that.  Walking a dog?  And beat her up  because he's angry.  Does that make  more sense to you  in New York City  late at night?  no. 
[02:25:00]  If it was anybody  else but Randy Rhodes,  no.  Where do you live,  sir?  Where do you live?  Michigan.  You actually think  this might be  some type of  a right-wing  hate machine attack?  Absolutely.  Not from Giuliani  or from Bush  or any of them people,  but I'm telling you  that my numb  robots that follow  the Republican  machine around,  yes.  Yeah,  but you don't think  that all the assaults  that happen on the  streets of New York, 
[02:25:30]  you don't think  that that is a better,  it's a better chance  that that is what it was,  was this just a nut  that is into maybe  punching women  in the face  or maybe an attempted  rape and then  heard something.  Who cares that she  wasn't displaying  a purse or jewelry?  She might have  had cash in her pocket.  You don't think  that makes more sense  than this right-wing  politically-based attack.  Have you had a rash?  Did you have you  had a rash of...  Dude,  it's a rash of...  It's New York City.  There's a rash of  assaults every day 
[02:26:00]  in this city.  It happens, dude.  It's gotten a lot  safer here,  but believe me,  it's nowhere...  Is the M.O.  the same?  Yes.  Yeah!  People just come up  and sometimes  people will be  standing there  and a homeless man  will come up  and hit you  with a cobblestone  in the head.  There was a guy  recently,  very recently,  where he was  just stabbing people.  He ran into a place,  grabbed knives,  and was just stabbing.  He stabbed the guy  and then he just  started stabbing  an old lady.  I mean,  this sounds like  just an assault,  an attack,  a violent mugging. 
[02:26:30]  It happens here.  Or attempted rape.  We just have a little  more info on this  because we live here.  We live here, dude.  I mean,  we see these stories  all the time in the paper.  Like,  random attacks.  I'll tell you one thing.  If it happened  to Sean Hannity,  the guy would be  laying there  with a bullet in his head  right now, so...  But I'll say one thing, sir.  That's the difference.  Sir, let me make a point to you.  I would almost say  maybe you're right  if a sniper had picked her off.  Like,  if she had come out  of her apartment  with her dog  and a bullet  had just been fired  randomly from another apartment  or across the street 
[02:27:00]  into her head  with no explanation,  I would say,  you know what?  That could be  some kind of a biased thing.  Ballad point.  Ballad point.  But did anybody ask her,  did she hear Christmas music?  Yeah,  there you go.  Which way is yours?  But it sounds to me  like the politics of it,  the liberal,  it's like you're like  the Republicans  and the robots  who follow the Republicans.  It's like you don't think  the Democrats  or the liberals  are the same way?  And what were they  supposed to accomplish  to scare her  where she's not going  to do her radio show anymore?  Without sending a message to her.  Without telling her  that's why they were doing it. 
[02:27:30]  At this point,  I think if that's the case,  then they just empowered her more  and empowered her show.  Yep.  So many more people  are going to want to listen  to what she has to say.  Oh my God,  Randy Rhoades got attacked.  I got to listen to this.  Right.  Well,  she does have a good,  she has a very good point.  I'm sure she does,  but if you're going  to beat somebody up  and to discourage them,  if you want to discourage somebody,  you beat them  and tell them.  It's almost like  when you owe money  to the mafia,  they don't just like  throw a random punch at you  and run away.  They tell you 
[02:28:00]  why they're breaking your legs  because the message is  pay us  or we break the other one.  Yeah, right.  So unless a message  was sent to her like  shut your mouth  on the radio  or you're going  to be killed.  Or you're going  to get this again.  Right.  This is just a warning.  But why would you  not send a message  if you're beating somebody up?  Meanwhile,  she'll heal  and go right back  to doing what she was doing.  No message was sent.  That's a good point.  Did I just see Al Roker  actually shot put  a baseball  instead of throw it?  Yes.  That was really awkward  to look at.  All right. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, Dave.  Thank you.  See you, Dave.  Thank you, boys.  All right.  Well, this guy,  Bob the Trucker,  wants in.  Bob, what's up?  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, I think  I think it was  how do we know  she wasn't  delivering a message?  You're right.  How do we know?  You're right.  We don't.  We don't know that.  You're right.  You're right.  We do not know that.  I'm assuming that she wasn't.  But if she was,  it will absolutely come out  and we'll say that.  Well, I don't know.  There's lots of things  that don't ever come out.  At least not officially,  not in the mainstream. 
[02:29:00]  But why wouldn't  she say it?  If she was  delivering a message,  hold on, dude.  I'm letting you talk,  but she's a radio host.  Why wouldn't she say it?  Well, she's taking  the rest of the week off.  We don't know what  she said at this point.  Does she have access  to the media right now?  No.  Well, man,  a lot of people  are going to be listening  to Randy Rhoads  when she goes back  on the radio next week.  Hold on.  What do you do?  What do you think  she's got access?  Sir, what do you mean?  She might say it.  She might not have the courage.  What do you mean  she doesn't have access  to the media?  She's on a radio show.  Right now,  right now,  this instant,  we don't know  what she's saying. 
[02:29:30]  Okay, let's say  for the sake of argument,  just give me this  for the sake of argument,  no hate message was sent.  Let's just say  it was an absolute  horrific mugging  that this poor woman  happened to just be  at the wrong place  at the wrong time.  Yeah, I'll take bets, man.  You know,  this is a random act  of, you know,  assault there.  I admit that's possible,  but I'm very suspicious.  We should have  random acts of kindness.  Where are you from, sir?  She can't tell you  about 9-11  that you'll never see  or hear in the mainstream.  But you hear them enough,  dude,  you hear them enough 
[02:30:00]  and you won't hear them  in the mainstream.  Rosie O'Donnell  was on The View  talking about  the 9-11  crazy conspiracy theories.  No one has tried  to take her out  and she had a lot more  people listening to her  or focusing on her.  Get for her.  They took out  a man named Bill Cooper  years ago.  It didn't do him any good.  Okay.  But do you understand?  I don't know Bill Cooper.  What did Bill Cooper invent?  What did Bill Cooper do, sir?  The Cooper machine.  Who's Bill Cooper?  Author of  Behold a Pale Horse. 
[02:30:30]  He kicked off  the modern-day  conspiracy movement.  But what is  a conspiracy movement?  Doesn't it go  on a case basis?  Yeah, doesn't it have...  Is there a conspiracy?  When did the  modern-day  conspiracy movement start?  For me,  it began when  the militia movement  popped up in this country  back in the 80s.  I would go with JFK.  I think that's the biggie.  It wasn't conspiracy  before then,  but it was representative  of a lot more people  than ever paid attention.  No, because you've got  to go Pearl Harbor.  Yeah, you've got to go  Pearl Harbor  for modern-day  conspiracy theory  to begin.  Because I think  conspiracy has been around 
[02:31:00]  since the cavemen.  I think you've got to go  World War I.  World War I  started the  modern-day  conspiracy movement.  The main.  Yeah.  Remember the main?  What was that?  Spanish-American War?  I think you've got to go...  I'm going to go  Christopher Columbus.  Yeah.  No, you've got to go  for conspiracy.  You've got to go  all the way back  to the history.  The Rome sponsored  false flag terror.  Well, sir,  that's what they were  doing in humor.  They had to tell  the movement  on their enemies  in order to...  Is that what  the liberals taught you?  I think you have to go  all the way back  to Mesopotamia. 
[02:31:30]  Absolutely, sir.  The cradle of civilization.  My only point is  as far as  modern-day conspiracy  and what's a substantial  number of people  in this country...  Which starts when?  And I'm believing in it.  Let's put a year  on the beginning of this.  Let's put a year  on this, though.  When did the modern-day  conspiracy theory thing  start up?  What year?  What year?  It's hard to put  an exact year.  Late 80s, early 90s.  That's when  the militia movement  got big.  Can I ask you  an honest question?  Do you think  that it bothers  people who are really left,  and I'm not saying  just liberal, 
[02:32:00]  but kind of radically liberal,  that this ideology  that they defend  could just be  this random act  like a guy  saw a white lady  and saw her  as an eerie target  and beat her up?  That kind of...  It's almost like  a confirmation  of some of what  conservatives say  can happen,  and that's annoying  to liberals  to have to face that.  I'm sure it works  the other way, too.  That is possible.  I don't deny that.  I just...  It's just suspicious,  and I want  a lot more info on it.  I'm not willing  to write it off yet. 
[02:32:30]  Okay, but I'm only  asking that question  because, to me,  this is not just  a sniper bullet  in the head.  This is just a thing  that happens in New York  all the time.  We don't know anything  about the criminal.  Maybe he did something  that indicated  that she should  shut up on the radio.  Okay, fair enough.  I don't know.  All right.  You do have a point,  like the caller  before you said,  but I'm still not ready  to completely dismiss  it as random yet.  That's fair enough,  but to me,  the first place  that John Elliott goes  is that.  To me,  that's just paranoia, 
[02:33:00]  and it's almost like...  It's like...  Do you understand?  Most liberals do not  think that crazily,  but that, to me,  is just so radical  in its thinking.  It doesn't make sense.  He could have,  should have tempered that  by asking the question  instead of presenting it  as though he already knew.  I'll grant you that,  but the question  deserves to be asked.  Okay.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Bye, mister.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's say hi  to Dave in Massachusetts.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I'm just curious  if she would think  her attacker 
[02:33:30]  could be rehabilitated  and if she would  stand up for his rights  and he could be  re-released into society.  Maybe.  Perhaps he just needs  a hug  that he's talking to.  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Like a terrorist.  And by the way,  a very good point.  Jay's from New York.  It's coming in a lot.  Rainey Rhodes just jokes  about being black.  Chase in Minnesota.  Chase, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, Jimmy?  You're hilarious on HBO.  Thank you very much, buddy.  Out on DVD today.  Yes.  Really?  All right.  Didn't Eli Whitney  invent the hate machine? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, the cotton gin.  That was the, yeah,  the cotton gin.  Hmm.  Was that a hate machine?  No, sweaters are wonderful.  We'll look into that.  Yeah.  Hate machine.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Someone said  my Escalade's a hate machine.  I was not.  Any machine, Anthony's in.  Max in Dallas.  I've been.  If Anthony was sitting  in a church pew,  it's a hate machine.  Anthony could be sitting 
[02:34:30]  in an infant's lap  and it's a hate machine.  He does have a lot of hate.  I know he does.  I want to hug him.  Anthony has a lot of hate.  No, I want to smooth  Anthony's hair.  I have a lot of love.  You're right.  I do.  Okay.  I just, I hate it.  Yeah.  Talk to the crickets.  Max.  Bye.  Jimmy, you stole my thunder.  I was going to submit  Anthony's Escalade  either on his way home  or his way to work  as a hate machine. 
[02:35:00]  I honestly did not  come up with that.  Whoever did,  that was very funny.  It was you, Max,  from Dallas.  That was a good show  you had there on HBO,  Jimmy.  You rock, buddy.  Thank you, Max.  All right.  Let's play the Giuliani thing.  We were going to play  this on the other side  and we lost time there.  Kid asked Giuliani  about aliens attacking.  Stupid.  If we find that there is  something living on another planet  and it is bad 
[02:35:30]  and it comes over here,  what would you do?  They're all laughing  at the stupid kid.  Wait, why is the kid stupid?  Because he comes up  with this ridiculous question  of aliens coming down  and how we're going  to deal with that.  What's ridiculous about it?  I think we've got problems  with other types of aliens. 
[02:36:00]  Do you believe  or not believe in aliens?  I do.  They come across the border  and they take my tax money.  I don't know  if they've come here yet,  but I do believe in them.  The aliens?  Yes, of course.  I believe in the aliens.  You have to.  I love the alien movies.  I know that.  But as far as...  They make them look silly.  As far as aliens go,  I don't know if they're...  If you don't believe in aliens, 
[02:36:30]  look at your cat very closely.  Cats aren't aliens.  That's your first clue.  Cats are just adorable.  That's your first clue right there  that there's some crazy shit  that happens out there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, can I ask you  an off-the-topic question?  Who eats the fucking pens  that other people have to touch?  I believe that's Earl Douglas.  I asked for a pen from Iraq  and look what he brings me.  Let me see.  Ew.  Okay.  Like to chew his pens? 
[02:37:00]  I believe that's Earl Douglas.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  No, no, no.  Don't even tell him.  There you go.  There's your fucking pen.  You want to chew it?  There we go.  Right up the old dumper.  You see that?  Yeah, we see it, Jimmy.  There you go.  Let him chew the fucking pen now.  All right, just leave that pen there.  Where's the pen, Kyle?  You want to chew pens?  No, no.  Put it in there.  Put it in a special...  Here, put it on the napkin for now  and then we'll place...  Hold on, hold on.  Let him put it in there.  You want to chew pens?  But he's not here.  He will be later.  But place the pen... 
[02:37:30]  Oh, there you go.  All right.  And can I have one that hasn't been eaten?  Thank you very much.  All right.  That's all I ask.  Don't eat the fucking thing  I have to hold and write with.  Well, this is what Giuliani said  about the alien attack.  Okay, I'm going to tell you...  I'm going to tell you  that that is the first time  I've been asked that question.  In presidential campaigns,  you find that you get asked  the same questions over and over again,  which is good  because what it shows is  that the people in New Hampshire  are really concerned 
[02:38:00]  about the same things  as the people of Florida and Iowa.  You guys are much more similar  than you think you are.  You are.  But that's the first time  I've been asked,  how do we get prepared  for an out-of-space attack?  What is that?  Well, if we're properly prepared  for all the different things  that can happen to us,  we'll be prepared for that as well.  What an opportunity  to be funny.  Yeah, and he just  didn't quite do it. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, dear Lord Jesus,  this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  Well, that's great.  That's just fucking great, man.  Now, what the fuck  are we supposed to do?  That's some real pretty shit now, man.  That's some real pretty shit.  Yeah, they, uh...  Stupid.  They would have their way with us.  Get out of here.  Stupid.  Let's go to Ken in California.  Ken?  Yes, sir.  Hey.  Hey, uh, you know what?  I don't think we'd mess  with the aliens  unless they had some oil. 
[02:39:00]  Is that what the liberals  told you?  It's all about the oil, man.  Follow the money.  Yeah.  Follow the money trail, people.  Alan's just sniffing.  Follow the money.  I like Alan.  I really do.  Even though he doesn't like me  on this show,  I don't care.  Of course not.  He's a cliche-ridden boob.  Follow the money trail.  Yeah.  Follow the money.  I've been wrong about everything.  Was that question staged? 
[02:39:30]  Probably not.  It was a little kid.  A little kid got up  on the mic.  A little dopey kid question.  A little kid's minds  work a little differently.  Why wouldn't he have prepared  some sort of an answer  that didn't make him sound  like a blithering asshole?  A babbling fool.  People in New Hampshire  are the same...  What?  Shut up.  Little kids are scared  of scary monsters,  things under their bed,  the Loch Ness Monster,  and ghosts,  and aliens.  Aliens are scary.  That's the world  they live in, unfortunately. 
[02:40:00]  If we were attacked  by aliens,  that's great.  That video is going  to be available now  to just make him  look like a total fool  for the rest of his life.  Remember when you asked  a presidential candidate  this?  Right.  And if he's elected president?  Oh, remember that?  You asked him this?  Oh, how adorable.  Look at the stupid question.  He's like 20, 21 years old.  He's got his girlfriend  with him over the house.  His mom insists  on popping that in.  There's so many better things 
[02:40:30]  that he could have said.  Can we play the question again?  I just think that as a...  Yeah, sure.  You don't have to be a genius  to think on your feet.  Right.  Which one?  The alien thing again?  The kid.  Yeah, the little kid.  If I can figure out  how to use his new CD.  It's amazing.  The little kid  with his little question.  For some reason,  you've got to push  a couple different buttons  just to make...  so you can play it  off the board.  I don't really get this.  Here it is, I think.  If we find that there is  something living 
[02:41:00]  on another planet  and it is bad  and it comes over here,  what would you do?  Well, that's very simple.  That's very simple.  We would round them up  and fuck their mouths.  The little kid's  just horrified.  You needed that long  set up for that.  That's what I wanted to say. 
[02:41:30]  Jesus Christ.  Had to figure out  how to work the CD machine  and everything for that.  That's where it was going.  Apparently,  there's a...  on YouTube...  Yeah.  Do you have that?  What?  What?  There is  in Reagan's  alien speech  to the UN.  Apparently,  Ronald Reagan  gave an alien speech  to the UN.  Well, yeah,  of course.  And you think  it's silly, man.  The aliens will 
[02:42:00]  eventually make  their appearance known.  Oh, really?  Or make themselves  known to us, yes.  Let's go to Peter  in Massachusetts.  Peter?  Find that clip.  Good morning.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy,  help me understand  something here.  You pay money  to get shit  and pissed on  by filthy prostitutes  but a chewed-up  fucking pen  sends you into a spiral.  Dude,  I'm not saying  I'm not inconsistent.  I do understand that.  But yes,  it does.  First of all,  I haven't paid  to get shit on  in a long time.  Oh, okay.  Second of all, 
[02:42:30]  it's in the privacy  of my own bedroom  and I don't grab the log  and then try to write  funny notes with it  in studio.  No, you just take it  in your mouth.  Yes, I have, sir.  I agree.  But I agree with Peter,  though.  It's a little weird.  I know that, but Peter...  Just chewing on a pen  is pretty tame.  Yes, I'm not saying  it's not tame.  Just do it at home.  You know what?  If Earl wants to lay  on his back on plastic  in his bathroom  and chew pens,  fucking eat them all day.  And how about  you do one pen  that's your pen,  you keep it with you  and not have that  because that does  gross me out, too. 
[02:43:00]  I guess what Peter  is trying to say is...  All right.  Peter, anything else?  Hello?  Yeah, I'm right here, buddy.  Anything else?  I mean, I answered  your question, I think.  And there's sexual things also.  Dude, did you ever  lick a chick's asshole?  Atta boy.  Did you?  Did you?  Uh, yeah.  Okay, that's all  I want to hear.  Hey, Anthony.  If you've licked  a chick's asshole,  then the pen thing  shouldn't bother you,  but it just...  It doesn't bother me.  Okay.  It bothers Jimmy.  Yes, it does.  And it will always  bother me, sir. 
[02:43:30]  For the rest of my days.  I'm just saying,  it bothers me.  It bothers a lot of people  that have done, you know,  horrific things during sex.  Yes.  But that's sex.  It's not chewing on a pen.  There's no pleasure  in chewing on a pen.  I'm sure if chewing on a pen  made Jimmy cum in his pants,  he'd be chewing on  somebody's chewed pen.  You bet I would.  Yeah.  Making cumzies  all over the place.  Right.  I'm buttering my thighs  as we say on the homestead.  All right.  Fair enough, fair enough.  All right, Peter.  Thank you.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Al Roker's getting fat again 
[02:44:00]  and I love it.  I just said that.  You did?  Yep.  I said he's getting fat again  and you could see it.  Keep eating, you slob.  When you get that  stomach stapling thing,  a lot of people  don't understand.  You still have to  like exercise  and eat right.  It's not this free ticket  to just eat whatever you want.  Steve C. said that.  He goes,  the stomach stretches  so you still got to exercise.  Look at him.  He's an animal.  It's slowly but surely  the steroids he takes.  Start stretching.  Wow, he did gain a lot of weight.  I hope Al Roker  laughs really heartily  and he shits his pants 
[02:44:30]  and his stomach explodes  at the same time  all over his fucking  Imus blog.  Fat cunt.  Fucking go shit  in your own mouth.  Fat stupid face.  Trying to be a real reporter now?  Yeah, that's what he's doing now.  What's the matter?  You're not satisfied  with a little rainy here  in Minnesota?  Tap dance.  Yeah.  Fuck up.  You scat man.  Crothers are an umbrella, fatso.  That's who you are.  Again, the Reagan speech?  I could have it right now.  Yes.  Which one do I pot?  PC on it.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  What, I push this button.  That's what E-Rock hears in his head all day. 
[02:45:30]  Hey, E-Rock, why are these pens here?  That was so annoying.  That could be the most annoying thing ever broadcast.  No.  Okay.  That's the annoying one. 
[02:46:00]  That is really annoying, yeah.  That other thing was kind of annoying, though.  All right, this just in.  Naked Tickler Belief captured after years of eluding police.  Hey, wait, weren't we playing something?  They got to figure out how it works.  Oh, the Reagan thing.  Oh, I thought you had pushed the other button.  How it works.  Sorry.  Why don't we cut it up in another studio and bring it in. 
[02:46:30]  Why don't we do that already?  Be a cut up, please.  A 50-year-old man arrested after police said he urinated into milk and left bodily fluids  inside a home is believed to be the naked bandit who has terrorized women for years by sneaking  into their homes and tickling sleeping victims.  How do you not love this guy?  You can't not love this man.  He urinated into milk.  What anti-social behavior.  That really is somebody who's just angered. 
[02:47:00]  How angry at women to pee in their milk.  Milk.  Milk.  Milk.  Milk.  Milk.  Anky in their milk.  I hope that doesn't become a new thing.  I hope this does become a new thing. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, now people are suggesting ones.  All right, I'm going to try Thomas Overbecks from Dallas.  Let me have the floor, please.  Revolution number nine. 
[02:48:00]  Trip out Tuesdays.  I like it, Top Gun, Canada.  All right, where are we at?  Police said Thomas Bussine.  He was arrested over the weekend when a police dog attracted his scent to a sports utility vehicle  after a woman said she was fondled in her sleep.  Investor Gator said Bussine's actions fit the modus operandi of a man they had been hunting since 2004  in connection with more than 12 naked intrusions into central Florida homes.  Oh, my God.  He's doing this to old broads? 
[02:48:30]  But look at Linda Collins, what she said.  She woke up to a naked man tickling her for the second time.  I felt something on my leg and thought it was my cat.  And I look up and it was this naked guy.  And he ran again.  No, no, that was the second time she'd been...  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Oh, the second time he had broken in.  She must have been a fun one to tickle.  Combs said she did not know if Bussine is the man who tickled her because she only saw his buttocks.  His buttocks. 
[02:49:00]  I would recognize him more if there was a shot of his skinny white butt, Combs said.  The second time he was naked as could be.  Naked as could be.  Isn't naked naked?  Naked is naked.  As naked as could be means that there's no human way you could be less naked.  And being naked...  Or being more naked.  I'm sorry, I said that right.  Yes, yes, more naked.  But just naked...  No one ever says I'm naked, yet I'm wearing a fedora and a shirt.  You're naked means you have nothing on.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Police said Bussine has admitted to breaking into women's homes and videotaping them while they slept.  That is creepy.  Great.  He's Robert Blake in fucking The Lost Highway.  Oh, you didn't say that?  No, he finally got me, man.  He was weird.  However, he has not admitted to tickling women.  In one of the cases, he was seen urinating until I have count of milk.  How do you not love this guy?  He's a tinkling...  He's a tickling tinkler.  A tickling tinkler?  They're sleeping a little better in Central Florida today. 
[02:50:00]  I know.  All right.  Dan, your cam is froze.  Oh, man.  Thank you.  Please, Cam.  What is...  What happened?  It just froze his cam.  I'm looking at myself on PalTalk from across the room.  And I just look like a turtle in a shirt.  No.  I do.  My head is like someone's...  It's a side view.  And I should just...  Every time I open my mouth, I should go, boop, be-dope.  And then that's it.  See, people adore you.  They like me because they relate to my nothingness.  Let me pop you on so people can... 
[02:50:30]  All right.  We'll take a break as we fix the PalTalk cameras.  Can I plug my weekend gig?  Oh, it's all done.  Danbury, Connecticut.  Danbury, Connecticut at the Treehouse this Friday and Saturday.  He's going to the Bree tour.  The Bree tour.  Danbury and then Queensbury.  Queensbury is November 2nd and 3rd, but Danbury is this Friday, Saturday.  Danbury.  Danbury.  All right.  We're going to try the CD player again.  Look, it goes in.  Okay.  And every other radio station in America, all you have to do while it's in over there is  push this.  But see here, we... 
[02:51:00]  Now we have to do other steps.  We have to...  What do we have to do?  You got to hit stop.  Stop and then on again.  No, we have to hit stop and then pause, right?  Pause.  Stop.  Skip to the first try.  That is so stupid.  Pause.  That's crazy.  And then finally we can get to the clip.  Ronald Reagan talking about aliens.  Perhaps we need some outside universal threat.  Yes.  I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an  alien threat from outside this world. 
[02:51:30]  And yet, I ask you, is not an alien force already among us?  What could be more alien to the...  The Mexicans.  ...universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war?  Oh, he's just...  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  But he talked about it like, you know...  Yeah, but he was kind of...  It's not like...  Yeah, like a unifying thing.  We saw it.  It was called Independence Day.  Will Smith was so funny in that when he's beating the aliens up talking to him. 
[02:52:00]  In jive talk.  Yeah, that's funny.  Yeah.  Because you always see, you know, fighter pilots using that type of language.  Judd Hirsch was very funny in that, too.  Right?  You've got to save the world!  Oh, my God.  Could he have put it on more?  We get it.  You're Jewish.  My son's a doctor!  We get it.  You hate Christ.  That's why I watched that awful movie with Jamie Foxx where he was a pilot. 
[02:52:30]  Stealth?  Stealth.  There's nothing worse.  You know, I understand the black action hero thing and whatever you want to, you know,  however jive you want to talk and everything.  But it just seems a little odd that you're flying this, you know, multi-billion dollar piece of machine.  Are you going, yeah, I fired them missiles!  It's like, I've watched many military shows.  And the black guys that are fighter pilots, very articulate. 
[02:53:00]  And they sound the way that, well, they sound like they should be being made fun of by guys in the hood.  Because every word out of their mouth sounds just like they're white companions.  That's all.  They're military guys.  They talk in military talk.  Yeah, you wouldn't really get, like, the real jive kind of, you know, urban lingo out of those fighter pilots.  But that wouldn't make for a fun movie.  It's more fun to hear, like, the jive as they're fighting aliens. 
[02:53:30]  Like, oh, yeah.  I'm coming to, I'm up your ass now.  Yeah.  It's like, you don't hear that.  You hear, uh, Fox one.  Fox one.  Well, it's like, uh, like what Judd Hirsch was saying in Independence Day.  Yes.  Do you think there are many pennies on this spaceship?  It was every ethnic stereotype.  I was going to drive in traffic, but I said, oh, the traffic is too much. 
[02:54:00]  My son, my son, he's a very smart boy.  The ships, they look like a giant yarmulkes.  They're flying, and I'm going to go to a temple while they fly.  We get it, Judd.  You're Jewish.  You're Jewish.  It's okay.  We've seen Jewish people.  We're not shocked by you.  I've never seen anybody play up a stereotype, and I like Judd Hirsch. 
[02:54:30]  Let's do it again.  the most stereotypical  like when my brother got his first echoplex and i played with it  a hot dog what happened what what happens now what is it 
[02:55:00]  do you need my son to fix it what happened that's my son oh my son's a good boy

[03:02:00]  i will watch megan's law yeah what is eligible hey um you see that's funny the first thing opie  just read and let's introduce logan uh lefkoff yes uh wait why lefkoff as opposed to something  else to get some name but you don't say like obviously you've been on a lot of tv shows and  stuff you would think you would get like a showbiz name uh well you know what i just kind of uh  i stuck with my my name probably because it was my professional working name and once once i did it 
[03:02:30]  at once it just kind of stuck i mean what else would you suggest for me what is that local name  probably yes yes eastern european descent yeah nice something like that logan lefkoff logan lefkoff  is fairly it's harder to say but it is kind of memorable you look at it it's it's a you wouldn't  see that name and like you'd know you've seen that name before yeah otherwise what you remember that  old your porno name your dog your pet's name don't go there yeah don't go there listen my first 
[03:03:00]  name was sappho and what street did you live on the you know island of lesbos  what was the street sappho chestnut  i don't think they're gonna want me on uh on tv with that name so all right listen uh you got a  book it's called uh third base ain't what it used to be yes and it ain't what it used to be the  question is basically how to teach your kids about what's going on out there and well it's it's  that as well as kind of a look at really what's going on what kids and teens are doing and and 
[03:03:30]  basically how the the government is kind of screwing this all up with the abstinence only and these  crazy messages that doesn't work that abstinence thing definitely not not to interrupt but i'll be  raising a good point about you ejaculate the men ejaculate more sometimes i uh last night i was  annoyed at my girlfriend and the night before i hadn't done anything because i'm a compulsive  self-pleasurer and i i masturbates um seven times a week minimal probably once a day which is not  that unhealthy that's no definitely not but you know later i i did hear this morning the fight 
[03:04:00]  about last night whose house you were going to so maybe we should talk about that later i wound  up i had a towel on myself because i knew it was going to be a doozy i swear to god this is  and i laid back i didn't have any tissues so i just grabbed a towel and i laid on my chest  and it was it was it might have been a five sputter well but each one arcing in the laundry  i mean that's pretty bad it was it really was is that good logan is it good it's good for him 
[03:04:30]  obviously i actually stood the towel up and we're using it like furniture but they are different  amounts depending on how much sex you've had the reason the question was asked is i once uh got this  question from a teen girl who was freaking out she thought that she was pregnant because she and her  boyfriend and obviously had all this sex and all of a sudden it wasn't the same amount so she thought  oh my god i must be pregnant because there must be some extra left in me so oh girls are so stupid  well we just don't know enough about you and you don't tell us enough about your own body so 
[03:05:00]  you gotta tell the girls look to not get pregnant you gotta take it in the dumper absolutely that right  there is a good way to uh but of course you know everything else you know not not so healthy in  terms of risky sex but no no that's for sure i'm just talking about uh we've always said you know  ass sex is for the young i'm not talking about older people having ass sex where it could be dangerous  or nothing like that you know ass sex and i think uh man-on-man gay sex for the young yeah for the 
[03:05:30]  young and that's kind of for the young yeah for the young yeah it's just uh for those who are more  resilient who can bounce back and it just sounds sexier yeah and i think it sounds sexier and then  the i think the ass kind of um as far as body degradation goes i think it's probably first on  the list of the place you don't want to see in an older person it's probably what's always so funny  to me though is that anal sex for those who aren't you know who believe in abstinence and think it only 
[03:06:00]  means intercourse is that anal sex is like a really good option and it is by the way listeners  i want to i want to let everybody know it is it is an option a great option speaking of that uh why  do men and women have anal sex if they can have regular sex oh and did you like my answer uh well  that's why i'm asking well the the question was is that what what was regular sex right because  obviously this table regular might be a little bit different than regular 
[03:06:30]  i have that corner over there yeah i i tended to go into a weird direction but you know for me  honestly my favorite way to get off is regular sex missionary this is a problem i've gotten into  i have i'm so desensitized from jacking off like i have to have my nipples played with which is what  does that do like it just centers me like all of a sudden like something's missing and then my  nipples are being toyed with and i'm like oh that's the ticket and everything works well the nipples are  a sensitive place women feel the same way about some women feel the same way about their nipples 
[03:07:00]  too but also if you're used to it any kind of new heightened sensation really gets things going you  know yeah but if i want to stop having my nipples played with do i have to keep having sex and just  like give my like take the bullet for a while and just like kind of retrain my body well you don't have  to retrain your body but if you're a good partner then you'll you know let her enjoy it for a little  bit too i feel bad that a woman always has to be like on on double duty they have to tell they have to  like play act but they don't mind my face being in theirs and then they have to do physical work  with my i can basically norton can't orgasm unless yeah you're tweaking with his uh nipples 
[03:07:30]  you know the bad thing is jimmy is that with the playing with the nipples as you get older you're  probably going to have these stretched out fucking like i don't twist nasty nipples i don't yank  them you know yanking no it's gentle what is it jimmy oh like little light oh he does it and  goes put your fingers out like they're both little windshield wipers and go left right go  oh is that what you do i don't like a wipe or move with your index fingers i like them licked gently  i don't let's all try that which way whichever you want i just do that you don't like like cow 
[03:08:00]  milking machines oh god no just make any that's ob is it working for you no no his chest isn't  sensitive i wish mine wasn't logan uh where you at with snowballing where am i at with yeah  yeah meaning am i okay with it yeah i listen i'm okay with anything as long as it's you know  consensual sex right i mean that's that's the goal for all of us to have these great pleasurable  experiences as long as it's uh emotionally and physically healthy yeah that's the kind of girl 
[03:08:30]  i am now um i'm there's a section in your book third base ain't what it used to be where the  10 common questions about sex children and teens won't answer to or or answers to oh yeah  what is what is third base saying what it used to be like what does that mean i'd say i don't feel  like i'm so old but third base was definitely any kind of touching below the waist yeah oral sex was  not on that baseball diamond i mean oral sex was something at least when i grew up you did what  do you mean after wait what do you mean by a baseball diamond feel him fuck him forget him  that's what i say i never and that was uh maybe it was a long island i was like find him go home 
[03:09:00]  jerk off thinking about him feel lonely and hate yourself okay but again we're we're blowjobs or any  kind of oral sex on that i don't know where that came no it was like it was kissing was first base  up the shirt was second base fingering a girl's third base and the home run was sex i guess it  all fell into the home run category yeah but blowjob was like holy shit anal sex was a grand slam right  right guys anal sex was a grand slam in the ninth inning yeah yeah absolutely got dirt on your helmet you 
[03:09:30]  but now i think the idea is that now it's definitely uh it definitely seems like it's oral  sex it's an option in the arsenal it's no big deal behavior all right listen i yeah your oral  sex uh comment about uh dental dams makes me a little nervous you have to have options right  who the fuck would use a dental dam to have a little oral sex people do it and the idea is that if you  want to be sexually active and you want to get pleasure or give why don't you explain what a dental 
[03:10:00]  dam is uh dental dam is a latex barrier which you basically place over a woman's vulva  so that when you're going down on her you don't make direct contact with her genitals this seems  to really take away from the sensitivity and the sexiness of the whole thing about a condom  let me tell you a condom at least a condom which are horrible anyway but at least they have been  specially designed to try to increase the pleasure on on both parts male and female they use different 
[03:10:30]  materials that they try to get them thinner the ribbed thing the the so it's looser around the  guy's head a little so you get some sliding action a dental dam is pretty much just a piece of rubber  with no real well there are special companies that make you know thinner it looks ridiculous though  you have to stretch it out like yeah are you suggesting that we raise super kids is that what  we're at no i want us to raise kids that are that feel good about their bodies and make good 
[03:11:00]  decisions about sex so we're not also screwed up god knows that if we look around yeah our world  today but dental dams are for queers throw the condoms away a dental dams are the best things out  there no it looks like you just took a vagina out of a fridge like a leftover nobody wants a dental  i understand why you have to give options right no but it's it you know what it is it's like a  dinner vagina it's like two pieces of like meatloaf night before they kind of tumbled apart with the  clear wrapping over it nobody iconic for blowjobs is terrible too i disagree hookers use them though 
[03:11:30]  like couple like people you pick up dating don't use them for blowjobs yeah here's the thing if  everyone was talking about their you know safer sex practices and getting tested then do whatever you  want but the problem is no one talks about it so you have to take the necessary precautions or at  least explain that they're out there take a jab at if you're if you're being pretty sexually uh  promiscuous then maybe you got to start doing some of those things you know hookers things like  that a lot of partners thing but if you're just you know hey you hook up fuck it you'd be surprised 
[03:12:00]  roll the dice roll the dice roll the dice you live a little well i i know you don't like kids right so  send whatever whatever nasty message there is to them where you at i do i hate the kids that's why  uh you know roll it over uh come on the tits uh the ass uh whatever it takes what do you have  against uh ass to sex uh uh mouth to uh uh yeah thank you i stumbled because i can't find a not a 
[03:12:30]  not a word on in your book ah ask the mouth where you at with that analingus is not mentioned huh  well i probably because that's not one of the things that that at least the kids and teens i've worked with  typically ask about but you do raise a good point it's certainly something that's uh that's out  there do you have kids you look young to be writing about teenagers what i'm asking i i work with kids  but i also i have a two and a half year old son how old are you are you 28 29 i'm just i like you  i'm not being polite either no i'm 31 okay all right so you have a little kid i have a little kid but 
[03:13:00]  i i do a lot of work with with kids and teens of all ages so uh i i'm like the um the new version of  the the gym teacher all right yeah have you been uh promiscuous to any point in your life i mean  because someone to get into sexual therapy there has to be well i'm not a therapist oh whatever  i'm a sexologist and sex educator but i think that there are some people who get into these fields  because they're issues i actually got into this field because when i was learning about my own  sexuality i watched myself and these really smart women out there making really stupid decisions when 
[03:13:30]  it came to sex what was one you made that was stupid well i just think that i wasn't enjoying sex  that it was always about my partner and i didn't understand my body and when i went  well it was good for him but it wasn't so great for me and i problem  well i wanted to uh i wanted to find a better way and i looked out there and you know dr ruth was there  but i didn't think she was going to be culturally relevant to my peers so i said you know what i'm  gonna uh i'm gonna do something about it so uh what'd you do differently give up uh you know 
[03:14:00]  well i started to learn more about myself i started writing columns about female masturbation  and all the ways that we could get in touch with ourselves that actually benefit men in the end  no no he's got a good question what do you do with a partner that made you yeah  if a guy's selfish he just jumps on pumps and stops right that's self right so what did you do with  a yeah like what was your big turn on where it turned it around for you right i don't think it was  so much no it was not during the act of sex it was that i understood my body and i said okay listen 
[03:14:30]  you know this is what i want this is what feels good and you know i know you guys aren't going to  believe it but mutual pleasure is the best pleasure i know hey look my nickname why is that old i don't  know i just didn't think that was your thing was it you don't know about me yeah yeah i'm seizing  my selfish lover my nickname is the clit kissing kid that's what they call me that that's a great  nickname i was hoping for a bigger laugh on that but i got none at all and i deserved it i'm a big  fan of the car wash the car wash oh yeah oh that's uh just the whole face just comes out looking 
[03:15:00]  car wash you you know you're making sure you're taking care of the undercarriage the undercarriage  you know everything you know if the kids are in school aren't uh going for the uh the ass licking  yeah i'm just thinking of what a joy it would be to take that delorean back in time knowing what you  know now and just be the ass lick king of your or your school yeah it would be like you would be  the king of all the girls would be going around going this guy right here licks ass and you'd be out 
[03:15:30]  every night just licking ass here's the here's the problem yes problem problem the problem is is that  girls don't feel that comfortable about their bodies growing up right which is why we don't talk  about masturbation and what the clitoris is and all these other things so that would scare the crap  no but you just you just tell them oh what a beautiful asshole you have but the problem is  we know that you go talk about in the locker room after so we're not but i know because i went back  in time i know not to do that yes i know what problems that causes and the point is this women 
[03:16:00]  are uncomfortable with their bodies right like i i happen to have a fetish and i talk about this very  openly about larger vaginal lips but women are self-conscious about that so when you make a  woman feel good about things about herself that she is self-conscious about she will  your brains out because she if you make somebody feel sexy like she's like my asshole like i'm not  even being nasty i like an asshole that's dark i know that's not dirty clean but dark some heinies  you like a dark pigment i fucking don't know like a deep dark hiney i don't know why it looks like 
[03:16:30]  fucking climbers should fall on it spelunking i like that but it's got to be clean but women are  self-conscious like i want to have my asshole bleached like leave it okay that is a strange  concept to me first of all why reaching the asshole yeah they do that oh yeah yeah why are you bleaching  your ass silly do you uh don't you don't have to bleach yours right no okay good uh what about uh  the girls not wanting to have sex when they're on their period what's wrong with that i think it's 
[03:17:00]  okay for a girl to not want to have sex when she's when she's on her period that's okay what about  having sex on the period again if it's a woman's choice she wants to that's okay too but i mean  is it a safer activity no how do you fly oh jimmy hates that by the way how do you feel about it  how do i personally feel about it i mean if i'm in the mood i'm in the mood and my husband wants to  then what's unsafe about it well no the idea is that it's not you know technically can women still  get pregnant if they have sex during their period technically they can although we always grow up 
[03:17:30]  saying hearing that's never going to happen is it possible yes and from an std perspective yes it's  possible so it's really a choice but again so much of sex is really about women not feeling good  about themselves and making assumptions that their partners think they're gross or dirty and then  worse that we think we're gross or dirty and then we never have any pleasure at all so i'm i'm  totally with you you got to make them feel good about themselves yeah but it's got to be sincere  like here's something else i think is very sexy big fat nipples and dark big areolas even if they're 
[03:18:00]  pink big areolas like just yeah yeah the make the breast look like there's something wrong with  it like but that's what happened like it's swollen like it's swollen like it got stung by a bee i  genuinely like that yeah yeah yeah man you like you have this thing about like fat things you like a  lot of yeah man your pussy lips look look like howard the duck's mask jimmy likes plump i do i just but  i'm saying i really like it and so many women who have that are like i always feel like there's something 
[03:18:30]  wrong it's not it's not good it's like it's weird looking looks like it belongs on a deli slicer  it's certainly does like a stack of liverwurst but that's with a fucking lincoln hat on it  with a clitoris we always think we always think the body image is about weight right but it's so much  especially when it comes to sex i mean we are not going to enjoy sex at all or let alone let our  partners enjoy sex with us if we feel like we're gross what part of your body are you self-conscious  about if you had to pick oh my goodness i mean i think that i have moments where i'm self-conscious  about everything at some point but i would say probably my stomach because i've had a kid oh 
[03:19:00]  no did you ravage yourself lasagna belly yeah did you ravage yourself with a child i did i did i did  and i watched women do that did you i did did you rub vitamin e on yourself and uh did you do everything  that you were supposed to do snap back exercise i did i did but you know you work you have to work  hard at it did you carry big no no no did you is it better now your size queen is it better now 
[03:19:30]  is it what better now the uh the belly oh yeah yeah can we see it no it's hidden it's tucked away  it's not perfect but i'm happy with it but you're happy with it all right that's all right a little  bit of scarring that comes with having a kids it's like stretch marks no no no what is he gonna like  stretch marks are genetic so you might be you might be uh picky stretching well that's what i'm saying  i i could i could be picky you ever see a lasagna belly yes but you know don't make her she comes in 
[03:20:00]  here to say don't make girls feel bad about themselves and the first thing you do is start  making her like no no no it's obvious she doesn't have lasagna belly you know and i i would say that  even even if i did what that's one of the things that comes with uh the goods and bads of having to  carry you know a lot of women justify it by saying it's you know it reminds me every day of my  beautiful child that i gave birth to every day i look down and see that my body has been ravaged 
[03:20:30]  by a child why not just adopt exactly love to do that please yell at it from yeah you don't even have  to care about it that much i want to adopt if it gets lost you don't care you get a new one  adopt a child and scold it yeah yeah exactly no i love my pet little jack jack oh so cute  no no i got him from uh steve from bay short okay but pets never grow up they're always babies so  you know yes but they're always babies you always gotta pick up hey hey only children could be that 
[03:21:00]  way some kids remain babies their whole lives too that's true progeria no they get older wait a minute  a primordial dwarf i was thinking uh i was thinking down syndrome i was you were thinking  emotional emotional yeah yeah like flea see that kid out there he's he's 43 years old and he looks  like uh it looks like he's 17 which one is your husband out there he drinks and he's not he's in  vegas though he's he and my dad are huge fans of yours i'm gonna guess he can wake his ass up in  vegas nice not that huge of a fan how do you still live in vegas and have a well my guess is 
[03:21:30]  he's not sleeping he did carry his uh his portable but you know who knows who's in the room with him  right now he's probably using a dental dam to wipe something off the floor that he didn't use  during oral sex who's this handsome guy with you no i'm not hitting on you dude i'm just  my publicist okay is it going well so far sir he's bothered by this whole interview hey uh  could you get aids from oral sex there logan though rare it's possible how is it oh you'd 
[03:22:00]  have to have like blood to blood bleeding gums i know but it's like one of the things we always  talk about is before you go out on a date don't you brush your teeth never never okay well then  i gargle with salmon oil i'm like if she likes me through this she's a keeper she's the winner  no but they like oral sex like i very rarely will put on a condom getting blown actually very  rarely never um i've had girls do it never but uh i can't give them aids or get aids well i don't  have aids but i'm saying i'm well technically if you were hiv positive you could pass it to them 
[03:22:30]  could i get it from a girl though you you of course you could but it's rare but it's rare rare hiv  transmission through oral sex is rare you're far more likely through something like anal sex vaginal  sex is even rare for a man to get it from a woman more rare than than um you know male to female  transmission but but but absolutely possible well you're pumping it right into her so as long as  you're not having man-on-man ass sex you're not going to get the hiv let's be honest with you  no no no all right hey uh speaking of which do gay people want to turn you gay definitely not 
[03:23:00]  definitely not but i think that that's the perfect you know that homophobic kid in high school who  thinks that all gay people are strange and want to make them gay and and obviously that's not true  they're not interested in you why are some people homophobic  because we're so scared and concerned with things that are different from us we're we're  phobic about everything in this country um doesn't it mean you secretly want to suck a a cock no but i  think that everyone at some point has a fantasy about doing something that's outside the realm of 
[03:23:30]  what's what they consider normal i don't fantasize about blown guys but is it weird that when i'm jerking  off all i think about is a man putting his feet in my face no of course not listen you know  of course that's weird i think no that is very weird i think about a man all the time i think about  a man with his feet wrapped in saran wrap a dental dam dental dam dipping his man feet in my face oh god  you know you'll have so much material now after i leave you'll say god latex dental dance for all your 
[03:24:00]  things i'm basically i'm what they call a uh i'm like a bottom pig is this wrong like i like a bear  so what i think of it and not to be this but when i masturbate i think of a man who doesn't wear  deodorant laying on me a bear and putting his armpit over my mouth hairy right saying like lick it kid  you must have some unusual childhood uh experiences jimmy oh childhood some weird adult experiences  let's talk about masturbation yes let's yeah what can you tell us about that uh masturbation thing 
[03:24:30]  that we don't know about well we know about masturbation but something new that people will  be like wow i didn't know that that we should actually tell our girls that it's okay to do that  they should be doing it that it's so much a part of who we are girls should masturbate or guys girls  should masturbate too are they're doing it though aren't they not everyone and part of it is imagine how  you grow up right girls learn you guys know that you have a penis and testicles you have to  touch it every day you see it every day you don't the neighbor will 
[03:25:00]  totally different story all together but girls don't have the same kind of attachment especially  i mean imagine one of my issues is like when kids are babies and and parents teach them the names  their body parts are like oh it's a t-ta or a hoo-ha i mean that's that so you should say this is a  this is a cunt no well i was gonna go for vulva oh right oh well i thought i learned something  so what's the proper name that vaginal vulva vulva i hate vulva can we like it doesn't sound sexy 
[03:25:30]  i gotta tell you that sounds like something you drive vulva vulva our anus penis you are never to  blame you are never to blame remember that kid but i would fart what i mean it's so embarrassing  having a grown-up say you know your wee wee is no i i i actually agree with you on that i'm just  trying to make a joke hey so you know uh what what about i see this page on 141 so you know what a 
[03:26:00]  condom is but will you show your kids how to use it how do you show your kid how to use a condom  well not on yourself like like like mom's showing how to roll it on with her mouth onto a banana  let me show you what i learned in college here's how the hookers do it oh listen you know on a banana  on a zucchini on a we we had when i was doing um the sexual health workshops in college we had this  this wooden dildo we called it woody it was a really original name and that's what we practiced we  showed people how to practice on why was it called woody i have no idea it was jewish it had glasses 
[03:26:30]  no glasses just a label on the bottom with its name i i i gotta i gotta tell you something though  if you can't figure out how to put a condom on that's sad i would i am surprised at the thought  that you would have to instruct somebody once you look at it but some people roll it down the wrong  way roll it down the wrong way it doesn't roll it well that's the point but they keep trying  backwards you mean every time it's like our thousand dollar contest you gotta give it a quick 
[03:27:00]  zip zip to see which way it's going and that what no good and then and then give it the old  slide down before you lose your rod because putting those fucking things on it's so unromantic  yeah but i think they're kind of sexy no they're not they look silly they look goofy i like to put the  condom just over the head of my penis and leave it there like a little hat that is a perfectly new  fashion statement you ever you ever get one lost in you no we get a lot of people calling about 
[03:27:30]  that one heard about that yeah yeah like judd hirsch i put i put it on would you look at my testicles  they're beautiful my son has testicles my son's a mathematician we get it how do we uh get crabs  oh how do you get toilet seats i watch the deadliest catch and it's very difficult and  people die people die you mean as opposed to the the parasitic uh oh okay i thought you meant the 
[03:28:00]  delicious king uh variety uh no no crap i don't think so they they latch on your pubis yep with uh  those claws and how do you get them off can't you just shave your pubic hair off well the only problem  is is that the they're they're only lights when they're like the adult size so they're some of them  are tiny and microscopic so you have to use that you know when you get lice as a kid and they they  use oh yeah never had shampoos thank god i had crabs three times and how'd you get rid of it jimmy  i didn't i just let them fester i know they're still there oh they're crawling across the table 
[03:28:30]  jimmy jimmy or crabs jimmy lets him die of old age  gray-haired crabs falling out of his pant leg i know you see it there's one on you right now  ah no i actually got them uh when i was 19 i was having sex with a girl who was like 15 or 16  and she was a slut she was awful and the first time i got them you i had i have weird straight  pubic hair like an asian i i really do my people care is awful that's why i shave it and i had to  go get rid medication rid and you rub it in put little rollers you wash everything cute i do like 
[03:29:00]  it's a gang member and content and i uh you have to wash it out and then you take a little comb and you  comb through it and get any lice or any eggs out of your pubis and they're they're like tiny those  tiny metal white did you ever pull a fonzie where you go to the mirror with the comb and then just  go hey it looks fine that's right and then i let the dimitri sisters play with my crabs  yo cunningham and then ralph now's father the dentist would look at my pubic hair making wacky 
[03:29:30]  jokes as i infected his eyebrows with my crabs while he blew me in front of mr c who would attempt to cure  my crabs by hammering my pubics with a fucking from his hardware store with a hammer he would bash  my fucking pubic area then chuck would walk in and go remember me i don't know why and that's the  second incident of crap that was the second it was the lost episode yes and the last incident was when  i got them from a shirley feeney shit in my mouth and apparently the big ragu slid over my rod and had 
[03:30:00]  cramps in his ass hair  logan's not laughing i'm sorry i'm not i'm not like a counselor you know no no this is very  interesting on page 205 it says what do i do if my parent has an std oh if my parent has an std  that's what it says what do i do if my parent has an std laugh at him and take the car for as long 
[03:30:30]  as you want to hopefully hopefully it's a lesson right if you find out how they got it and what  it is i mean it's a it's a great i mean not great for the parent but a great learning experience on  the next lifetime exclusive i hate that word slut i know why okay why do you not like that word i hate  that word well first of all you said anything goes with the sex thing so well anything does  go i should throw the word slut around just like get her a little work out of bar just when you meet a  girl my issue well first of all i have two issues with the word slut first of all there's no male  counterpart for it uh yeah and if you tell me man whore i'm gonna like no no you have to leave 
[03:31:00]  you're right though man whore do you want me to leave he's like get the hell out of here no  yeah you're right there isn't it's kind of a double standard thing so it's an unfair term and also i  can't stand when girls use it to describe other girls like as if it's cool yeah what's that slut i'm  like oh you're basically describing the n-word for girls right because the n-word there's no uh  there's no white counterpart word like hockey it is like man whore and that doesn't really work 
[03:31:30]  to get people going nuts and other black people use them on themselves and you hit you hate when  girls call other girls slots well i have guys call us sluts too but yeah i think the issue with  language is just as long as we challenge it and talk about it and we just don't take it at face  value don't you think there are some sluts out there yeah i mean there are i mean there are some men  and women that make kind of you know poor choices when it comes to sex but who are we to judge i would 
[03:32:00]  say if a girl comes home and she's got like four different batches of uh semen in her from four  different individuals in one night that's a slut okay where is she keeping the batches by she's like  i mean seriously where are they kegel exercises and she can like really tighten it up yes she could it's  like it's watertight like a watertight door on a ship and then as soon as she walks through the front  door it's like when one of those helicopters or planes is putting on a forest fire it just opens  up and both of her ankles get a dose she could she could open up and skate into the kitchen you know 
[03:32:30]  it's i listen labels are labels you can call people whatever you want but at the end of the day i'd like  to think that we could let people make their own decisions you prefer whore well whore for i mean  technically refers to like a money transition but better than that kind of lost it i think whore kind  of lost the money thing back in the 1800s and then it just became she's a whore i just think  this the word slut is just used so much that people kind of forget what it means and at the end of the 
[03:33:00]  day it's you know saying to a woman that the words lose your decisions suck your decisions some women  like that to be called that in bed you better know that in advance but there are women that if you're  like some women love it yeah some women love it but right but you don't want to be in bed and say oh  you're such a slut and she walks out my girlfriend unfortunately is not one of the women  loves that as i found out oh really tried some of that dirty talk did you yes okay do you like that  slut just excuse me pardon and i'm like do you like that slut that we saw walking down the street 
[03:33:30]  i didn't care for her at all honey hey here's a question um what are the three holes of the vagina  the three holes well technically there aren't three holes no right but the idea was but there's  three inputs right well well if you're talking about the genitals and now i mean the urethral  opening right where urine comes out of so that you're not i mean there's nothing going on there  can i interrupt you for one second i apologize looking go for it what i'm saying about the 
[03:34:00]  three-holer is basically like if a woman will have anal sex oral sex and vaginal sex you say that's  my girl she's a three-holer that's right that's what that's got to wear the badge of honor also  known as the bowling ball you get yeah you got to put that in your next book yeah the bowling ball  there's a good mouth-fucking technique that jimmy describes on the show you want to describe it to  logan i'll just pull down my fly and you can show her i don't want to be disrespectful but let's just  say this that's okay you lay the gloves going to a hospital and you find somebody who has obviously  been injured in accident or can't move and you give their face a straddling and you pump away and you 
[03:34:30]  laugh with your buddies while they film it for youtube hey until the cops knock on the door  i know it's barbaric but it's not about hurting somebody it's more about the confusion on their  face right you don't work at the hospital do you jim jim i want to see what kind of a a sexpert she is  can you logan can you turn around jimmy's gonna make a noise and you gotta tell us what the noise is  what's going on well i i can't explain because then i'll have to write it or something oh okay yeah all 
[03:35:00]  right yeah you'd like me to turn around yeah you won't it won't but i won't touch you it i promise  you jimmy's gonna make a noise and as a sexpert you should oh my god tell us what this is i'll tell  you when it's over now just this is something i've heard better but don't look at it  okay yeah god it could be so much i know yeah that's what makes it so hard yep see we're giving  you a test today you are giving me a test today i'm thinking it could be a really 
[03:35:30]  powerful ejaculation like the one you had last night after five days and well that could be  you're in the right neighborhood right i'm in the right neighborhood where though  it's kind of tough because she doesn't have anything going on other than the sound there's  certain things that go into it that the sound doesn't give away give her a visual cue  okay like this just watch closely logan here's what it looks like 
[03:36:00]  i assume it's a girl gagging as she deep throats you and then oh yeah  but it's almost like where they try to pull back and they can't get any air at all i've seen that in  video it's actually very funny when the cheeks puff out i love the way you say you've seen it in videos  no i don't gag people i'm too nervous to do that because a it's i'm not into that but b it would  hurt her teeth it could hurt right it certainly could be very bad be rather unpleasant what else 
[03:36:30]  could we uh learn today this is good this is good stuff i'm so glad i what i was so ready for you to  come in and tear out the pages of the book no not that's an old gag done with that old gag did  oprah ask you the same questions when you were on her show no when i was on oprah it was about um  how two generations feel about sex and i was there representing the 20 something population  do you plug your book on oprah was it no my book just no this was five years ago on oprah so oh 
[03:37:00]  how much does that sound i know you didn't have a book at the time send her a copy  so you're a fatso and inside i dare you to plug this  well hopefully listen hopefully she'll have it on i think that it's certainly a big topic especially  when we live in a world where there's a father have you heard of these father-daughter purity balls  um wow this doesn't sound very pure yeah exactly balls in it so part of this whole  i have heard of this part of this abstinence movement is that there are these  dances between fathers and daughters you bring your sweetness to the dance and then you hook up 
[03:37:30]  with someone else's sweetness i've heard about that isn't a swapping thing between fathers and  daughters how hot that sounds no even even worse and creepier is that fathers and daughters go to this  ball together and in front of in front of god and all the members of the community a father vows to  protect his daughter's chastity and she vows not to give a lot so there's a vow going on it's this  weird in front of god yes i bet you they're both on their knees huh guys oh oh it's uh it that is 
[03:38:00]  preposterous that is creepy talk about sexualizing the father that is absolutely making something out  of their relationship that should not be there absolutely that is a a vow husband wife kind of  thing but talk about how unequal right like the guy the father could still go out and have as much  sex as he wants and the mother and a daughter the mother and a son don't do it you don't see the son  and a mother standing there no very good point because of course you know women need to be 
[03:38:30]  women are the ones who need to protect themselves women god forbid women want sex hey we got a lot  of kids uh hey can we uh have some kids call please for uh a lot of kids are listening right now should  kids wait to they get married to have sex that's a that's an age i'm gonna i'm gonna just knowing  you enough i'm gonna say no i some people are ready at different ages than others yep and and uh  blah blah blah yeah age is definitely not a deter we are on the same page my friend the age of consent  should be four well i don't know about that but you know i've seen some very precocious kids i think the 
[03:39:00]  idea is that age doesn't determine whether or not we make good or bad decisions about sex and and i think we  need to start asking ourselves i mean do we want kids and teens never to have any sexual experiences  in their life what should it be the age of consent i want teens yeah when should kids have sex myself  when should kids have you know what i don't think that there is an age i think that there is a time  some people make good decisions at 16 some so you're thinking all right let's let's let's just go low  yeah 12 i'm gonna say no you'll say no at 12 i'll say i'll say no if 13 if your body's still 
[03:39:30]  developing and you're not and you're not fully you know sexually developed and it's probably 13  decision no where are you at 14 no but i think that by 13 and 14 you could be you know experimenting  with something that's certainly 15 15 is probably getting closer starting it closer but 16 but but  what 16 what if there's grass on the field you know what i'm saying that old gag well grass doesn't  mean you're emotionally ready to to have sex i think the idea is every person is different but 
[03:40:00]  waiting until marriage sex is an important part of marriage so why why i mean why wait to see if  you're compatible it's like my father always said if there's grass in the field spin her over and  put your bat in the dugout let's go to katie in ohio uh katie you got a question for logan she wrote  k12 she wrote a book called third base ain't what it used to be yes um i'm just wondering what happens  when a girl squirts what is that stuff well it actually it's it's fluid from glands inside the woman's 
[03:40:30]  reproductive system that come out of the urethra but it's not urine how women get really um insecure  that it's urine and they freak out but a lot of women and most of the times it comes from a g-spot  orgasm the elusive g-spot but um women who can do it i mean they rock most women can't do it most women  can't access it but uh guys what's what's your take is woman who can squirt uh don't want any part  of it want no part of that i love it thanks guys all right what about me what about the g-spot 
[03:41:00]  orgasm is it uh obtainable it's definitely possible um the problem is is that women search and search  sometimes men search and search and they can't access it so i mean if you're having great orgasms  without a g-spot orgasm then i wouldn't freak out but you know we read all these magazine stories  find the g-spot the g-spot is the greatest thing and at the end of the day you know what if you're  having great regular orgasms then the g-spot one if you can't find it so be it are you able to uh 
[03:41:30]  because are you able to come uh through sex or just oral sex my girlfriend i think it's just oral sex  well the most women can only most women only have orgasms from clitoral stimulation right so  and it wouldn't necessarily even be oral sex i mean as long as the as long as the clitoris is  stimulated during intercourse whether it's through positions or with the vibrate or whatever it is  what's the best what's the best uh position to get a woman off well technically anything where she  where she can control the so if she's on top rocking and rolling if she's on top how about backwards 
[03:42:00]  cowgirl backwards cowgirl yeah possible i would say some some women really like you know doggy style sex  because they could still access their clitoris but some women find that really uncomfortable  really is it wrong that my girlfriend can only come through oral sex and if i'm not in the room  she can only come if it's somebody else who's not white it has to be like when she's not expecting  it and she's walking yeah that's a good question uh you don't use any kind of manual stimulation 
[03:42:30]  as you're in your missionary position to maybe try to help her out there down there i play with her  pussy no i can't i'm not that my dexterity sucks see that might help though that would totally help  bring her to an orgasm while you're having sex i'm just suggesting hey i'm a fucking asshole what  do you want from me you're probably right but i can't do it so i'm getting defensive well you but  you you can get other tools other people i thought she was gonna get another person get a real man in  there that wants to how do you get an orgasm uh a girl to orgasm as opposed to asking her what she likes 
[03:43:00]  sex i would say work on her clitoris and find out if she likes it but don't go you know men  typically go straight for the genitals and straight for the breasts oh yeah such a pain in the ass you  know yeah you gotta start off talk to us and be nice to us no that's how we got to the genitals you  gotta start you gotta start off like an appetizer a little salad or something first right before you  dig into the why would we want any of the parts that you don't cover up we see them all the time we can  touch them in in public i know but if you want to turn us on sometimes it's those parts that we 
[03:43:30]  like to be touched before we guys are free yeah you take that shirt off it's like all of a sudden ah  tits we like a switch goes off and you'll lunge the panties come down whoa you'll lunge towards it  yeah why do guys like the tits well you don't have them what's the attraction to the the boobies  you don't have them you don't have them they're fascinating and you you've probably  but we do ours are just not inflated since uh since you were kids you see me in 2005 we certainly 
[03:44:00]  do uh let's go to rich in wisconsin rich you got a question for logan she wrote a book it's called  third base ain't what it used to be oh good question cleveland steamer what uh base is that  i would still say like you know beyond certainly i know what that is i'll tell you the base that's  sliding into third after a rain delay let's uh let's say hi to john john you got a question for 
[03:44:30]  logan yeah hey logan i've been with the same woman for 10 years and uh we're getting married next year  and i'm wondering is that the right time to go for the aspects or what uh when's the best time to uh  try to dip into that ass i you could certainly try now but the idea is to talk to her about it  first don't just do it you know let her know you want to try something new you want to be able to  you could you know you could still have anal sex and pleasure the clitoris at the same time 
[03:45:00]  they all reach around what uh sure what have you done what have i done yeah in in my life yeah i you  know my thing is i've i've probably tried a lot of things but i've i've been with one partner for a  long time so that's that's my thing i i think it's important you can go out and do anything you  want as long as you're in a relationship partner how do you partner have you ever been like deep  dicked or anything like that jesus hopey well it's not i figure we could talk openly you're a sex  but you know what's what's what what happens you know we're not having fun what happened no we're 
[03:45:30]  having fun and all but now you know what's wrong with a good deep dicking nothing nothing i'm sure she  would even say there's nothing wrong with it but to ask a lady like that is probably inappropriate  even if she wrote a book that we're plugging the hell out of here third base ain't what it used to  be oh but i just want to know where she's at with deep dicking i think that at some point you  experience everything right fine well she's answering the question you whore my god calm down  you don't admit to everything technically i didn't admit to anything no oh my god you're a 
[03:46:00]  very good egg you're very nice thank you and you're very she's very uh open to these horrid  questions we've been asking her and we definitely appreciate it not a problem let's say let's say  rich in new hampshire rich what's up hey what's up guys uh i'm just calling to give logan uh props for  not punching out already because i'm getting the deuce chills for her just listening to opie today  it's ridiculous what did i say that's wrong we're having a a very open conversation about sex this 
[03:46:30]  is this is why like this is why girls are getting pregnant and all this crap because we don't we just  don't talk about this stuff are you trying to say girls are getting pregnant because you're not asking  enough women if they like deep dicking getting deep dicks jesus christ what kind of a what kind of a  lunatic says that but i'm making a good point no everyone's too scared to talk about sex openly well 
[03:47:00]  that's true well we are scared to talk about sex but why is that why is it so scary everyone does it  it feels good to everybody so for the most part why so scary here here's my issue is that i cannot stand  that we live in a place where sex and sexuality are these really dirty words right yeah it's it's  horrible because sexuality is such a big part of who we are it's the way we feel about our bodies and  our gender and how we access pleasure i mean and there's there's so many good things about that  that have nothing to do with whether or not we're even sexually active but we make it such a dirty thing 
[03:47:30]  dirty bad thing that i mean and there are moments for that too but the problem is is that when kids  and teens grow up thinking it's dirty then they start making really stupid but generation after  generation keeps it dirty and that you you would think like after even the 60s when those animals  were just having sex all over the place that their kids might have been a little more loose about it  but they were more uptight than uh than the parents were well and and nowadays we have we have religion  controlling so much about what we do thank god how would the young boys get ass fucked oh god 
[03:48:00]  have you uh how those priests are have you ever have you have you ever uh pardon yeah thank you continue  let me uh i'm trying to think how i could say this carefully uh have you ever uh put a uh soapy finger  up your uh poop chute in the shower no one's looking i didn't think you were going there no one's looking  it's a you know you got slippery slippery digits have you ever just i got the hell of it not my  thing no not my thing what do you think about to you if that's your thing but i'm not saying it's 
[03:48:30]  my thing i'm just asking guys jerking off in the shower good or bad oh i fine you have no problem  with it in fact i have a i have a very good friend whose husband probably since he was 12 masturbates  every single morning in the shower that's a good friend she tells everything right he tells me  wow at the table he says i said the other night how you how's your morning shower still doing it  how do you feel down stocking drano how do you feel about guys that like like taking a log on their 
[03:49:00]  chest every once in a while how do i feel about it yeah that's a little more into the fetish area  i would think um but fetish it's called the jimmy norton it's uh no no jimmy hasn't done that in a  while i've gone almost everywhere you can go with and reason with the chickens yeah what are you gonna do  you know what if if it's consensual and it gives you pleasure and you're taking the necessary  precautions then i really think you're allowed to access your sexuality any way you see fit  well she's probably not the not the answer that you wanted no no that's fine wait did we answer 
[03:49:30]  that guy's question or did he hang up about asking for sex after 10 years yeah we did okay i wasn't sure  short and sweet i like the answers they come out it's like hey but this is it no no beating around  the bush david north carolina yes yeah i've been with the same woman for 13 years but in the last  two years the only pussy i've seen is on the computer screen and i've tried everything and i do mean 
[03:50:00]  everything from the slow romance to yeah in the shower whatever nothing nothing nothing what does she  say open a book with no fucking pages what does she say she's nothing she's dead  well i don't know what else to do i was gonna see if she had any suggestions yeah first of all  does she know about your porn habit because that could be turning her off a little bit habit he just  looks at a little bit yeah well it's not really a habit okay i'm just asking i mean if you know  women can be threatened by that well i do have a sex drive that'll outrun a fighter jet but i mean yeah 
[03:50:30]  in the last two years it's like zilch nothing i don't and i've done everything i know how to do  i don't know anything else i'm i'm looking for some new ways to go a new direction to go here's the  thing without cheating as as women get older women's sex drive changes and the way that their ability to  um lubricate changes and women sometimes have more difficulty with these things so maybe it's  something hormonal as she's gotten older that that her body has changed and maybe there are ways you can 
[03:51:00]  either talk about this or talk to a doctor about ways for her to increase her libido well she'll  be 43 the second of next month i'll be 41 this sunday i mean i just don't i'm still trying to  figure out i don't she says it's because we've been married for a long time i mean i used to get  blowjobs for breakfast but i mean yeah well david i i got something for you would you would you drive  a car that's 43 years old what i what uh nothing oh i don't know if you wanted to hear that 
[03:51:30]  i i have you spoken to her about i don't thank god because it sounds like you could kill me  blowjobs for breakfast have you blowjobs for breakfast what's in some peppers i know he's  hanging on the honeycomb hideout one of those teenagers would sneak up and suck his dick i think  there is a lesson here though right i mean we get this we get the message all the time that sex is  supposed to be wild for the rest of your life get yourself to a pancake every once in a while  enough protein jesus that's a carbohydrate uh joke silver dollar pancakes in the frying pan 
[03:52:00]  what's the frying pan involved believe me what i tell you i believe yeah all right david i love you  man that's fine all right hey logan i got a i got another serious question for you yes guy's  masturbating in the shower right he's looking for a little lube he takes uh he does a little  shampoo action right no and then uh he does what he has to do and then all of a sudden your pee hole  burns what's that about the the chemicals inside of you that's i mean that's the problem shampoo is 
[03:52:30]  for external use only so what you're saying that some of that shampoo gets into the pee hole  and then what happens well and it irritates it i mean those are soapy chemicals so you wouldn't put  them in your eye would you i don't really get it though every kid has done that at some point  tissue is like with the soap and then it gets in the tip and you'd realize you'd never ever do that  again and then it winds up you know the the tip of your dick looks like popeye for a few hours and  then you dread the first piss you have to take right guys yeah because you know it's just gonna 
[03:53:00]  and you know you have to go so you're gonna have to deal with it okay but do you go back the next  time use the same shampoo or do you make sure yeah that when that when the tip of your your  your pee hole gets all swollen because of the soap it looks like this it goes right it makes a little  pouty lip it goes and the tip and the tip is red it looks like you were kneeling on the side of the  street and a horse-drawn carriage wheel rode over the tip just the wheel just like you were kneeling there 
[03:53:30]  and you heard yeah yeah or maybe you were in the kitchen fixing the pipe and the chuck wagon wheel  ran over just the tip and it's really just the very tip it's going back into the cupboard and a  little swollen and a little pouty looking that's right let's get it and it hurts uh logan wrote a  book third base ain't what it used to be let's say hi to david michigan it's actually very informative  logan thank you yeah hey guys logan um i've been married with my wife for a while and uh we're  looking to spice things up i'm wondering what you how you feel about uh swinging and after you 
[03:54:00]  answer i guess i have another question okay well here have you have you spoken to you know your  girl about this about how she feels about this like is this one of your fantasies you have  together what what you think as far as like a ethics thing well i don't have an issue from an  ethics perspective what i do have an issue with is that oftentimes the fantasy when you bring other  people into your relationship is better than the reality because then you get jealousy issues and 
[03:54:30]  then of course the safer sex issues and that that becomes a real um that that could really change a  marriage all right well so ethically if you have no problem with it what are you doing this weekend  oh you are smooth thank you that's right up that's right up there with uh do you know the difference  between like a sandwich and a blowjob no well do you want to go for lunch it's like there's nothing  worse oh god than a setup question where the joke is contingent upon the person i wish you told me that 
[03:55:00]  that was a joke like last week because it's awful i went to lunch and put let's excuse me  it's so contingent on the answer being right like uh what do you know the difference between a blowjob  and lunch and if somebody said yes lunch is when you eat something in a blowjob is when your  cock is sucked then the person would go do you want another lunch oh it doesn't work no then they go  now i have to kill you yes hey why are some girls into fisting 
[03:55:30]  some well some men are into fisting too it's it's no i mean yeah but like the girl's taking  the fist well it's you know what it's a different it's a different sensation i i think the idea is  that every every woman's body is built differently and feels differently some women some women like  large large penises some women don't i mean and it's just a matter of what feels best for for  your body and some women like to experience fisting my girlfriend doesn't like large large penises  oh jesus let's hope or it's gonna be a long ugly string of explanations 
[03:56:00]  jimmy's saying he's that he has a small penis it's average but all his friends have seen it  it's it's it's not small it's average it's just i look like i should be packing one and a half  but average is i mean average is okay what is average that's a great question for logan  typically erect average is about six to seven inches that's average average but here's this is what i  feel badly when when we talk about boys growing up is that boys get all this pressure too you know 
[03:56:30]  be bigger harder stronger it's not just about the girls it's about the boys too girls just got to be  there ha ha see we don't want we don't want little boys growing up feeling insecure about their bodies  either there's always something wrong with them yeah i have to yeah yeah well she's she's been a  fantastic guest thank you she's unflappable well i don't know if you're trying to flap her out of  here no no no i mean like some people get offended or uh uh uncomfortable or they don't want to go in 
[03:57:00]  that direction with uh when they come in with a book like this but uh very good saying very open to it  that tells me that there's going to be a lot of honesty in the book and open uh uh uh conversation and  thought for the for the children how old would you uh suggest the funny thing is that it actually  the book starts with um birth really we should start talking about like dr seuss  the doctor but you know the whole idea of using correct body parts i i can't stand i walked into 
[03:57:30]  my girlfriend's house one day and she was changing her daughter who was about four months old on the  changing table and she said look logan's never seen a baby jiny and i thought oh my god what  first of all it's not a jiny it's a vulva like and if you want your daughter to be as screwed up as you  are then you'll start using the right word jiny is probably the worst thing i've ever heard  i'd rather hear slit oh i don't know about that yeah that is a bad one i don't know about that you 
[03:58:00]  ever hear girls call each other that that gets ugly no listen you yeah that's pretty  but who knows after today maybe i'll hear it all yeah you might all right let's uh let's thank  logan uh lefkopf thank you the author of third base ain't what it used to be what your kids are  learning about sex today and how to teach them to become sexually healthy adults right where can  they uh get this book well you can certainly get it at any of your major bookstores and on amazon  you were a terrific guest yes absolutely thank you now hit the bricks sister

[04:00:30]  upper but see this guy has a five incher so if you would have said five he his wife would have said  okay you're right uh five is average but again but that's okay it's all listen it's all in the realm  right i mean six inches six and a half inches what do you prefer seven inches what do i prefer  yeah like girth lathe teeny weeny what do you what's your thing size queen no not a size queen  no the size queen but but most women aren't that's the whole the whole deal right i mean most women 
[04:01:00]  aren't size queen so technically it doesn't make a difference whether you have a four inch penis  erector why aren't most girls size queens most girls aren't size queens i think that's the you would  think they would want to say wow we a lot you know what you don't have a lot of those nerve endings  in the back of the vagina anyway so it's really the the front third the front half to the front  third it's like the back of the vagina is like the wall that jeff bridges drove into and fearless  with rosie perez holding the toolbox a fucking fearless you're brilliant jimmy
