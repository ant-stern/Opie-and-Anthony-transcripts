<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a detailed recounting of Anthony's disastrous wedding.  The segment included numerous audio clips of the chaotic event, showcasing his low-budget ceremony at a justice of the peace's home, followed by a reception at a bar that later transitioned into a strip club.  His new wife's extreme intoxication fueled arguments with his brother and mother, creating a highly volatile atmosphere.  Listeners called in with questions and jokes, adding to the already raucous discussion.  Anthony also discussed his subsequent unhappiness in the marriage, mounting debt, and the impulsive purchase of a jet ski as an "emergency" measure.  Further audio clips revealed more embarrassing moments and arguments from the wedding and subsequent years of the marriage.  Foot's account of the wedding was discussed, including his mother-in-law's drunken flirting attempts.  The segment also covered Anthony's rushed purchase of a $300 ring in Penn Station and his bizarre proposal at his mother-in-law's Christmas party.  A 13-year-old comedy clip from Rich Voss was played and critiqued before the show moved into commercial breaks.

The show then transitioned to a scathing review of a comedian, "Boss,"'s 13-year-old stand-up routine, viewed via videotape. Opie, Anthony, and guest comedian Paul Mercurio relentlessly mocked Boss's material, which included jokes about relationships, anorexic people, and observational humor.  Patrice O'Neal, present in the studio, participated in the critique, even while ordering a suit on the phone. The discussion included numerous tangents, such as anecdotes about breakups, crowd work attempts, and countless off-color jokes.  Several commercial breaks punctuated this segment.

A rambling discussion followed, focusing on Marilyn Monroe's alleged flatulence and the imagined smell of her used bikinis.  The hosts engaged in highly vulgar and sexually suggestive speculation using explicit language.  This segued into more commercial breaks interspersed with off-color jokes and commentary.

The show then featured a homeless guest, "Tippy Tom," whose appearance dramatically shifted the conversation. Tippy Tom engaged in extremely graphic and offensive descriptions of his sexual experiences and activities, using highly explicit language. Opie and Anthony struggled to control his vulgarity, repeatedly interrupting and attempting censorship with limited success. Lady Di, a guest on the phone, was asked to consider highly inappropriate and vulgar acts involving Tippy Tom, which she refused.  The segment concluded with Tippy Tom's departure and further discussion of his behavior, including descriptions of bodily fluids.

A later segment featured Tippy Tom, who identified as gay. The hosts engaged him in a discussion about his sexuality, sexual practices, including questions about condom use and HIV/AIDS, and his health, revealing his diagnosis of liver cancer and Hepatitis C.  Tippy Tom sang several songs, including a Rod Stewart song. Lady Di, a female caller, participated, suggesting a sex act involving an appliance to avoid skin-to-skin contact.  The discussion was highly informal and laced with profanity and sexually explicit language. The segment ended with the hosts discussing Robin Williams' comedy style, followed by several commercial breaks.

[00:12:30]  to the guy even when the the marriage ends but if you screw it up and say you shouldn't marry this  chick you might blow the friendship so many guys will not tell the guy not to do this i didn't tell  my brother and like opie said at the wedding we're all just going dude this is just a goddamn disaster  in the making you know but you don't do it so you wait and yeah but they passed out the the blow-up  guitar and those uh risky business uh sunglasses so we're all off saxophones we're all feeling good

[02:45:00]  Check it out now  The Funk Soul Brother  It's Opie and Anthony Cowbell Bill in the studio  and Anthony's brother Joe hanging out for a bit here.  Sure.  While we were in commercials, you were trying to say something about Marilyn Monroe.  Yes.  They just did a huge auction, made an S-load of money off her stuff.  Got like 8 million bucks auctioning off her goods.  And $42,000 paid for a few bikinis.  They were selling her bikinis? I didn't know that. 
[02:45:30]  A set of bikinis including a leopard skin print, bikini bottom,  estimated at $2,000 to $2,500.  But the whole set sold for $42,000.  I don't know who bought it, but you gotta know, right?  You're buying Marilyn's bikinis?  You gotta take the sniff.  Aw, come on.  You gotta take the sniff.  Come on, Ed.  You're home, alone, finally out of the limelight for buying these things.  You lay them out. 
[02:46:00]  Get out of your cupboards.  Yeah.  You know, live with them a little.  And then you just bring one up and...  It's gotta smell like mothballs at this point.  Why, she's screwing moths?  It smells like Joe D.  You know, the guy from the Home Shopping Network should have did that auction.  It would have been much more interesting.  Limited edition people.  Look at this bikini bottom.  Smells like Joe D.'s finger. 
[02:46:30]  Me darling.  Look at this one.  And it's stain people.  Obviously, this was before she could fly on the wings of a maxi.  A little bit of leaking.  What about the birthday dress?  Home Shopping.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Yeah, that dress.  When she sang that and allegedly had sex with him right afterwards.  Right.  Actual President's blue. 
[02:47:00]  DNA people, clone your own Kennedy with a head.  Why?  We're all having fun.  Yeah, we're having fun, alright.  Isn't it common knowledge that Marilyn Monroe had a flatulence problem?  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  That bikini could tell.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Time out.  I never heard that before.  Yeah.  It's common knowledge.  Plenty of people said that she would, like, all the time.  Just be farting.  Ooh, Marilyn.  All the time.  Imagine that.  Happy birthday, Mr. President. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, Rob.  Whoa, that stinks, Marilyn.  I'm going to ditch you, but Bobby will take you.  Bobby.  Well, I guess some of those bikinis might show some telltale.  Oh.  Ooh.  I'm so sorry.  You know, I think there's proof of that, too.  There's a picture.  She wasn't standing over any air grate when her dress blew up. 
[02:48:00]  That was all her, baby.  That was after White Castle, is what you're saying, Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and then she blew out the candles on the President's birthday cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness, Marilyn.  Oh, look at my head went back and to the left.  Back and to the left. 
[02:48:30]  That's the first shot I took to the head.  My God.  Were the candles still lit?  Yeah.  It blew the cake up.  Funny, I don't remember this being chocolate frosted.  Didn't Elton John write a song about her problem?  Yeah, passing the wind, right? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm more frightened that you just found out you could do Marilyn Monroe's voice, Anthony.  I knew I could do that.  Do that again.  Come on.  Let's put on the hose bag there.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Happy birthday.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:49:30]  Ah, Marilyn, soon we'll be calling this the brown house.  It looked like I rode my 10-speed bike through a mud puddle.  Clear up to my hair.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's so wrong. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I'm sure the guy that got those bikinis knows, and we can only speculate.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sex for Sam.  Three.

Well, it all started back in San Francisco.  Yeah.  I went to a bar.  Right. 
[03:04:30]  When I ran away from home.  Why'd you run away from home?  Oh, it felt like it.  And I went there.  I hitchhiked.  And I was in a bar.  Right.  And I was sitting at the bar.  Defining moment coming up.  On Market Street in San Francisco.  Right.  And somebody came up.  Oh, I can't say this.  Oh, go ahead.  Want to say it?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Say it.  He gave me a b****. 
[03:05:00]  I know.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait a minute.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  That's true.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's true.

So you decided to give him a hummer, right?  Hummers.  Just say hummer.  A hummer.  A what?  A guy gave you a hummer.  Just say a hummer.  A hummer.  A guy gave you a hummer, and then you decided to start giving hummers?  Yeah.  Hummers.  Yeah.  All right.  And that's what happened?  Yeah.  A hummer.  Why is that?  If some guy...  I don't know. 
[03:06:00]  Some guy walked up to you in a bar and said, I want to give you a hummer.  And you said, okay?  A hummer.  What's a hummer?  Well, everyone knows what it is, so don't worry about it.  And you said, okay?  I hope it's going to be cool.  Right.  And you said, okay?  Yeah.  Hey, let me tell you another little joke I made up.  All right.  Voss?  There's this lady.  This guy joke.  She's in the airport, and she's got arrested.  They lifted up her dress, and they found two tons of crack. 
[03:06:30]  You don't get it, do you?  That's the Oprah Winfrey joke.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You got it.  We got it, Tiffy.  I have no act.  So what happened?  So this guy gives you a hummer, you give the hummer back, and that's where it went all wrong?  Yeah.  You decide you liked it?  It was like hummer, hummer.  What's it called again?  Hummer.  Hummer.  Hummer.  Hummer.  Hummer.  So it was like hummer, hummer.  Yeah, it was hummer after hummer after hummer. 
[03:07:00]  So you just kept giving them?  No, I didn't stop giving.  I just gave a hummer just the other day.  And then I got a hummer myself.  Wait, who did you?  What I'm saying is that.  Who did you give a hummer to the other day?  Well, I got a buddy that I hang out with.  What's his name?  And he liked to get the hummer.  Right.  You know, so I threw the hummer, and then he threw the hummer, and then that's what it 
[03:07:30]  was.  But there's other things that happened.  You're a good friend.  Like what?  What other things?  I can't say it on the radio.  Why?  Well, just say it.  No, I think he could say it.  Yeah, you could probably say it.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I think he could say it.  I think he could say it.  What else goes on there?  I said he f***ed me, my f***.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on. 
[03:08:00]  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  You can't say that.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  You can't say that.  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What?  How did I know that's what he was going to say?  All right, Keith.  Wait a minute, Tom.  Wait a minute, Tom.  Hold on.  Shut the homeless guy up.  I don't want to get up there.  No.  You've got to wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Get him out of the room.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tom.  Wait, Tom.  Where is he?  No, you don't get him. 
[03:08:30]  Wait a minute, Tom.  All right.  Tibby Tom has left the studio.  You want me to say it?  I don't know what made the radio, but it looks like he...  He took it in the balloon knot.  That's what happened.  He goes, you know, I'll say it.  I like to get...  He said it.  You know how bad that must be to do to a homeless man?  Oh, my God.  You know back there is just all brambles and...  All right.  Let me...  By the way, Anthony, that's not Tibby Tom.  Who is it?  That's our new consultant, John Minotti.  Oh, my God. 
[03:09:00]  Are you kidding me?  He has been brought in to clean up this place.  Look, I just have to make sure.  You're not the friend he was talking about.  I know, Keith.  That's friends, boy.  Let me tell you.  Keith, you're going to just let him wander the hallways?  No, no.  He's in the bathroom.  Oh, good.  Oh, God.  Good, good, good, good.  You just know he doesn't have many bathing facilities.  So when he does this, like you just said, some balloon knot action that he got from his friend. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, he said it much better than that, though.  Oh, he went right for the F word and everything.  There's like 15 people on hold right now that really enjoyed that last exchange.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And you know, to get to the balloon knot, when you peel certain things, it's got to sound like a fruit roll-up coming off the...  The smell has to be horrendous.  The smell has to be...  Because it's just bad coming off of them anyway, but imagine that area. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Ah, like you ever pass by a dead animal and that pungent smell of rotting flesh?  Where's Tippi Tom?  Cigarette around here.  Tippi Tom back in town.  Oh, hi.  Who does?  Oh, I don't know.  Give him one, Ben.  Give him a cigarette.  Give me a cigarette.  Give him a cigarette.  Tippi Tom on a cigarette.  Ben, give him a cigarette.  Give him a cigarette.  You got a cigarette?  Here, you can take it right out of his back pocket.  No, you can't. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, look at Ben's cursing, man.  What's up with this?  You got a cigarette?  No.  Earl, what's Earl?  Keith, he's been laughing at him.  All right.  What I'm saying is this.  Tom, what happened to your eye?  I fell down the stairs.  What stairs?  I fell down at 8th Avenue, Port Authority, down there, when it was raining a couple days  ago.  And you fell down the stairs.  I fell down the one side on 14th Street, and then I slipped on the water, and I went 
[03:11:00]  all the way down and banged my head.  Imagine seeing that happen.  Would you just be laughing your ass off if you saw him going ass over tea kettle?  What happened was this.  Yeah.  I woke up.  I'm bleeding like crazy.  Right.  I think it's time to go to the hospital.  Get him on, Mike.  And I got down the block.  Yeah.  Because I wasn't going to.  I don't like doctors, period.  So, I just, like, stayed there by the church next to the hospital, St. Vincent's, downtown. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  I'm bleeding more.  Somebody called the ambulance and said that I have to go to the hospital.  And I said, yeah, you think so?  And so, the blood has come gushing out of me, and I said, I think maybe you're right. 
[03:12:00]  And so, they call the ambulance.  Yeah.  They put me in there.  I'm bleeding all over the bed.  Everything is just coming out like I'm, I couldn't believe how much blood I lost.  Right.  And, yeah, yeah, that's what I did, infusion.  Donate some blood, you know.  Oh, yeah.  And, um.  Imagine slipping in that puddle of whatever.  And what happened was, is that they wanted to stitch me up, but I didn't feel like getting 
[03:12:30]  a stitch, because it was too painful.  They wouldn't give me no, St. Vincent's wouldn't give me no.  You take your buddy's junk in your balloon knot.  No, I'm mad at St. Vincent's right now.  No, you take, you take your buddy's.  I'm pissed off at them.  You take your buddy's junk inside your balloon knot, and yet, uh, that hurts?  The doctor's stitching you?  What?  Your, your buddy.  You said he, he put his junk in your balloon knot.  Oh, that was last week.  I'm talking about.  But, but, but the, uh, but the eye hurts?  Yeah, I hit my head.  Yeah, but what about your ass? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, my nose.  Well, I, uh, I don't know what happened to that.  But I, I'll figure it out.  Hey, I want to know where he has all this action.  If he's a homeless guy.  Hey, where do you go to have sex?  And the cops, we're not around.  Where are the cops when I'm banged up?  Tippi Tom, where do you go with your friends to have this?  Tippi Tom, I want to know why the, oh, the cops don't have no problem picking on the homeless,  writing out tickets.  But where you at when we fall down and bust our ass? 
[03:13:30]  All right, calm down, George Carlin.  Hey, Tippi Tom, Tippi Tom, Tippi Tom, I got to ask you a question.  Tippi Tom, I got to ask you a question.  Yeah.  Where do you go to have these sexual encounters with your friend if you're homeless?  Oh, you're talking about getting late?  Um, well, uh, it depends.  I mean, it hasn't happened for a long time.  You said just last week.  Well, he's a little scared.  Well, last week.  Tippi Tom is right next to him. 
[03:14:00]  Let's see.  Where do you go?  Last week, I forget who I was with.  That's true.  Because I'm a slut.  I'm a slut.  But where do you go?  You got to have some privacy somewhere, right?  Well, yeah, I know where to go with privacy.  But I usually hang downtown.  Uptown, no privacy.  Too many people.  So downtown what?  You go into an alley and bend over a garbage pail? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, somewhere around behind a dumpster or something like that.  Imagine walking down that alley, turning your head past the dumpster,  and just seeing Tippi Tom get nailed in his balloon knot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I get...  Well, yeah, when you get banged.  When I get banged, I like the...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, sh**. 
[03:15:00]  All right, we understand, but he can't say that.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Well, he likes to, uh, yeah.  Tippi Tom, no.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Tippi Tom, you sick ass.  He likes to get banged, but then he likes to take care of himself while he's getting banged.  I like the...  Yeah.  Right, just say that.  That's okay.  Don't use the...  Don't say that.  Yeah, right.  But, so, you like to take care of yourself while the guy is taking care of himself with  you.  Yeah, exactly.  If it go that way, it may go the other way.  Always.  So, I might have to do him like that.  The reach around. 
[03:15:30]  Then you gotta give the reach around.  And then do him like that.  I'm like, wow.  This guy is...  You're a good actor.  Get out.  Wow, what a trooper.  That's the way it goes.  Do you like girls too, Tippi Tom?  I had a girlfriend.  Yeah.  And I can't say this one, man.  Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.  What?  Yeah.  Let's hear about this girlfriend.  Let's hear about the girl in your life.  Because we want a girl...  I only had one girlfriend my whole life.  Really?  Did you have sex with her? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  And you didn't enjoy it?  The thing she liked was she liked me too.  Can I say it on the air?  Well, I don't know.  Wait, wait.  Do you think?  Well, let's think about this.  Do you think he can say it?  Yeah, I think typically...  Well, you know what?  I don't know your...  Don't say it.  No, no.  All right.  He couldn't say that.  Wait.  Hold on, Tom.  Don't say it.  Don't say it again.  I think we... 
[03:16:30]  Oh, my God.  I think we just found our new midday show here in New York.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Wow.  He likes to go dining, Anthony.  Right.  He likes to eat at the Y.  He likes to dine.  Yes.  All right, Tom.  Don't say that, though.  But we understand.  Just say you like to eat at the Y.  Eat at the what?  You know, you eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y?  Eat at the Y.  Okay.  All right?  So she wanted you to do that.  Eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y. 
[03:17:00]  You know.  Well, that's what I did.  All right.  And did she enjoy it?  I did eat at the Y.  Did she like it?  That's what I did.  Ed?  Tippi Tom know how to do that.  Did she enjoy it, Tippi Tom?  I don't know.  She liked it a lot.  Yeah?  But it turned out you liked...  She was pumping my face.  That means she liked it, Tom.  Right.  Is that okay?  That's okay.  That's good.  But then, Tom, Tom...  Pumping my face?  Tom, at one point, then, you decided you liked men more than women? 
[03:17:30]  Well, I liked them both.  Now, the thing is, I had more boyfriends than girlfriends.  Right.  But my boyfriend, Gary, well, you know, he...  We broke up, and the one girlfriend I had, Philomena, she didn't like me because I was  going out with Gary, and so I was like, you know, what am I going to do?  I'm dizzy.  Why'd you break up with Gary?  Was it over the hockey game with Oak?  No, I didn't break up with Gary.  Gary was mad because I wanted to stay with Philomena, too. 
[03:18:00]  Right.  Yeah.  I wanted them both.  I wanted a bimbo on my right, a bimbo on my left.  I wanted two bimbos, and they didn't like...  Tom.  Tom.  Yeah.  Did you ever...  You know when we were talking about eating...  I was greedy.  Tom, Tom, wait a minute.  When we talk about eating at the Y with a girl, did you ever do that to a guy where you,  you know, go around back?  I licked some...  I licked some...  No, baby! 
[03:18:30]  You can't say that.  No!  Hold on.  Okay, hold on.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Be quiet.  Why do you have a delay?  I'm trying to say it in a way, and he just comes out and says it.  And I'm just screaming to cover up anything else he's saying.  He's just yelling he's a slut.  I know, but he was saying something else, too.  So, uh, Tippy Tom has, uh, has, uh, tossed salad.  Yes, he...  Tossed salad.  Yeah.  I don't think we heard that. 
[03:19:00]  It's okay.  All right, Tom.  Why don't you take a break?  Okay.  Pop down...  Pop down someone on, uh, the phone lines.  I want to see if they're hearing this.  Uh, yeah.  Let's go to John.  John.  Hey, what's going on?  Have you heard, uh, what's...  We're dumping out of here on the show with Tom?  Yeah.  He just said that, uh, one of his friends was choking to death, and he gave him the...  Manover.  Hey, I got a question.  I'm waiting on.  Is this guy white or black?  White.  A white guy.  He's a white dude?  Yeah, he looks like...  What would you say he looks like?  He looks like Kiefer Sutherland if Kiefer Sutherland was beat up. 
[03:19:30]  Now, when he gets shot in that film when he's in court, that's what he looks like.  I think he looks like...  He does.  He's got, like, light hair.  So, he looks like a guy that's been on a life raft for three or four months, out in  the sun, all beat up, with a big beard and everything, just trying to, uh, be rescued.  What's happening?  Did he use the bathroom?  There was...  Seems to be a little mishap.  In the bathroom?  What happened?  What happened?  Opie's going to look.  Opie is going to look. 
[03:20:00]  A mishap in the bathroom?  Oh, and Jim Norton's going, I can't, I can't look.  Right, Ben?  Nope.  Because stuff like this totally disgusts me.  Did he...  Oh, my God.  Open that door.  Hold the door open.  Let me hear the reaction.  He's talking about the intern.  We got a new girl intern.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter, Jim?  Awful.  What was it?  It's just, uh, it looks like butterscotch pudding all over the bowl.  Oh, God damn!  And the seat, and the back of the seat, and...  It's actually a nice color for a throw rug. 
[03:20:30]  All over the back of the seat and everything?  He, he, he, he, he, he.  Oh.  Yeah, smeared.  Why don't we take a break?  Man juice will lighten up that color.  That might be what it was.  Where are we going with this?  All mixed in there.  Are we going to try to get Lady Di to do something to Tippy Tom?  Yes.  Yes.  What do you want her to do?  Toss salad?  Dude, what about it?  Come on, you got to go for the gusto.  She's got to toss his salad. 
[03:21:00]  If she just gives a hummer.  Or lets Tippy Tom do the Y, the ultimate rusty...  You guys are crazy.  That will never happen.  What if she, uh...  She will never do that.  She's got to toss salad.  I think tossing salad.  I think the odds are slim to none that she'll even just do the hum.  What if, what if we let Tippy Tom eat at the Y?  That's a fair worse for him.  That is, but it's funny as hell.  Well, where the hell is she?  All right.  Well, Lady Di, you need to call the show immediately, okay? 
[03:21:30]  And we'll take a break.  Oh, God, that is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  He's just sitting on the Ikea furniture.  Screaming.  Screaming and yelling.  He's barking.  He's barking.  He likes you, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue with Tippy Tom next.  P, O, P, and Anthony show.  New York, Dallas, Chicago, Philly, Cleveland, Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco.

Right here.  Look, he's got a wow shirt and wow hat on now.  All right.  What are we talking about?  He has his wow stuff on now?  He's got all of his wow attire on.  Tippy Tom.  Good.  Hey, Tom.  On the phone right now is Lady Di is on the phone.  Say hi to Lady Di.  Lady Di?  Yeah.  Hi, Tippy Tom.  Hi, Lady Di.  How are you?  All right. 
[03:34:00]  How are you doing?  Hi.  How are you?  All right.  How are you?  I'm all right.  That's good.  Yeah, man.  Just hanging out.  Right.  Right.  Nothing wrong with that.  That Lady Di?  Hey, let me ask you a question.  What?  Are you available?  Am I available?  Are you single?  I'm single, but, you know, I'm not really looking for anyone right now.  I'm a good looking guy.  Oh, yeah.  You're not looking for anything right now.  You're such a liar.  I'm not looking for anyone right now. 
[03:34:30]  What?  I'm not looking for anyone right now.  What's wrong with Tippy Tom?  Huh?  What's wrong with Tippy Tom?  I'm good looking, man.  I didn't say anything was wrong with him.  Yeah.  Why are you knocking Tippy Tom there, Lady Dot?  I'm not knocking him.  I'm trying to get a date over here.  He's not really going with anyone yet.  But you leave me alone.  All right, Tippy Tom, why don't you work your magic and talk to Lady Dot?  I can't say that on the air.  Hey, hey, Lady Di.  Yes?  Can Tippy Tom use your stink spot for a finger cleaner?  What I'm really trying to get across. 
[03:35:00]  Hold on, hold on, Tippy Tom.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Let's decide.  No, I'm trying to get something across.  I'm talking to some chick.  Okay.  What I want to know, if she want to f**k me.  No.  Hold on.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  No.  Hold on, hold on.  Everyone hold.  Hold on.  Oh, hey.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  I heard that.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  Don't say it.  Don't say it again.  Tippy Tom, don't say it.  He has needs, Anthony.  Don't say it, though.  Yeah, you have needs.  Let's just say that. 
[03:35:30]  Don't use that F word.  I have needs.  You have needs.  I'm a person.  Everyone has needs.  I'm a human being.  Oh, no.  Okay.  I want to f**k me.  No.  No, hold on, Tom.  Turn the mic off.  I'll be.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Holy.  We've run out of dump now.  Tippy Tom, you can't use that word.  Don't use that word anymore.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't use that one.  That's a bad one.  Yeah, that is a bad one.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:36:00]  No more bad words.  No more bad words.  Okay, no more bad words.  You can't use that word.  That's a bad word.  All right.  You want some good words?  You want some poetry?  No, no.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Until that dump light turns back on.  Not yet.  You want to hear a joke?  Not yet.  Hold on.  We'll get to it, though.  We'll get to it.  You can tell me a joke if you want.  Shut up.  Lady Di, shut up.  He did it.  I didn't do it.  Lady Di.  Yes.  We're going to suggest a few things.  We have an idea that will guarantee you we'll be a member of this program that you'll be  able to come back on with. 
[03:36:30]  Was it what I heard before?  Not exactly.  Okay.  There could be a few things here.  Yeah.  There's a few things.  Would you be up to tossing Tippy Tom's salad?  No.  No.  You can't be in trouble, man.  You can't be arrested.  You are there.  Thanks.  Oh, man.  Well, okay.  Well, you want to give her the one idea that I think might work?  All right.  I'll work on that one.  Go ahead, Tippy Tom.  All right.  Who's next?  Who's next? 
[03:37:00]  All right.  Can you lick my...  No.  No.  No.  Now I'm out of dumpy.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Jesus.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  La, la, la, la.  Shut him up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's going on today?  What's going on today?  What's going on today?  Shut up.  I understand.  He wants to know if Lady Dot will lick something on him.  His yam bag.  His yam.  No.  No.  All right.  Lady Dot.  We're in trouble around here. 
[03:37:30]  Lady Dot, would you give Tippy Tom maybe a quick handy?  No.  No?  No.  I heard some of those ideas before.  You could wear a glove.  No.  Lady Dot, if you wear a glove and give him a handy.  Mm-hmm.  You will be able to continue being on this program.  No.  I don't know if I want to do that.  No.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  Because.  No.  I can't do that.  What's wrong with you?  Huh?  There's nothing wrong with me.  There's nothing wrong with me. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  How about this idea?  How about this idea?  What's that?  You put on.  I sing to Tippy Tom?  You put on a.  Tippy Tom, don't talk right now.  All right.  Is that a good idea?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Don't talk yet.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Stop.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Oh, jeez.  What are they saying?  Shut him up.  His language is really bad.  Keith, shut him up. 
[03:38:30]  Shut him up.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Tippy Tom, take a break.  Take a break.  Bye.  He just started screaming, I want to F your egg.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Uh-uh.  Tippy Tom.  Any more ideas?  I'm reaching here.  Wow.  All right.  Lady Di.  Yes.  Here's the deal.  What's that?  You will strap on an appliance.  and service that man. 
[03:39:00]  I don't know.  You're thinking about it.  How would I service him?  If you strap on an appliance, he's a gay gentleman.  Okay.  And then, you know, you have to do the deed with the appliance.  Oh, man.  Any more ideas?  No, it wouldn't be your actual skin, though, because it's an appliance.  Right.  It's hygienic, and it's not even actually a sexual thing.  Oh, my God.  You wouldn't even be touching him. 
[03:39:30]  Hmm.  You understand what I mean?  There's nothing, uh...  What is he yelling out there?  Why is he yelling out there?  I'm an old-fashioned faggot.  Get him out.  Get him back on.  He's old school.  Ugh.  Lady Di.  Yes.  Come on here.  You got to do something with Tippy Tom.  Your singing is horrendous, and it's not going to keep you on the show.  My singing is not that bad.  All right.  Tippy Tom, you're what?  An old-fashioned faggot?  I'm tired of this bull****.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Now, what I'm saying is...  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[03:40:00]  Don't use the S word.  Keith, hold on.  Don't use that word.  We just ran out of more dumb.  Hold on.  That's a bad word.  Hold on.  Don't...  No more bad words.  Okay, thank you.  We just want to know.  Tippy Tom, we just want to know.  You're an old-fashioned faggot?  Is that what you said?  That's me.  Are you...  You're an old-fashioned faggot?  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  Now, I'll tell you this right now.  Ever since two years old, huh?  Shut up, Lady Di.  Yeah.  I knew I was a faggot when I was two years old.  Oh, yeah?  How did you know?  Yeah.  Because I... 
[03:40:30]  What?  I knew.  Lady Di, stop asking him questions.  Okay, all right.  I'm queer.  Okay, I'm queer.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  I'll tell you right now, Lady Di.  All right.  You had a second girl, mother...  No, no, no, no.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Take your...  There goes somewhere else.  You're damn right I'm a queer.  And I've been a queer.  And they're right.  And I'm four.  And I...  That's right. 
[03:41:00]  Okay, so I'm queer.  I'm...  Who cares, Ray?  Who cares?  So what?  So what?  I have girlfriends, too.  Yeah.  Hey, do you use protection there, Tippy Tom?  Do you use the condoms?  Excuse me?  Do you use the condoms when you're doing this?  Yeah, I use...  Well, I don't have...  Do you have the ninja?  I've done it much lately.  But, yeah.  Yeah, it's just...  Are you afraid of getting AIDS, Tom?  You don't die of AIDS.  You die of something else. 
[03:41:30]  You might get HIV, but you don't...  I know people who live 20 years old that don't have AIDS.  You don't die of AIDS.  And Dr. Tom...  You die of a cold...  Right.  That's encouraging.  What happens is it just...  It makes it so other things kill you.  Your immune system...  Right.  ...is down.  But so aren't you still...  You might be afraid that if you keep having unprotected sex, you're going to get the AIDS. 
[03:42:00]  You can get the AIDS.  But it don't matter.  You're not going to die alive.  You're going to die of something else.  That is a rationalization I have not yet heard.  You know something?  Yeah.  Living outdoors, don't you think you're going to get a cold?  You walk down the street, you get shot in the head.  Right.  What are you going to do?  If you're behind a dumpster, you can get shot in the face.  Yeah, right.  If you're shot in the...  That's even worse.  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  Exactly.  You don't die of AIDS.  Right.  But it kind of helps the other diseases kill you, though.  Exactly.  So aren't you afraid of maybe...  Right.  Aren't you afraid of maybe getting it and giving it to other people or something?  I don't know.  I don't give it to other people.  I have sex with nobody.  You just said two weeks ago you had sex with your friend.  No, somebody give me a...  No.  So I got a...  No, I'll say it again. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, man.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Timmy.  Oh, Tom, you're a classic.  All right, Tom.  You're a classic.  We said you can't say that.  You can say Hummer.  Yeah.  You know, you're still...  You got a...  Yeah, yeah.  You could still get the AIDS from that, though.  Yeah.  So what?  You get hepatitis C.  Yeah.  Which I've had for 20 years.  Oh, Jesus.  You can't catch it from nobody.  It just happens. 
[03:43:30]  You get it from food.  They don't even know where you get it from.  Your liver.  You only got one liver.  You got one heart.  You got two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs.  So the liver is three lobes, which you can live with.  It could be Tom.  You only got one liver.  And yes.  I got liver cancer.  How many feet do you have?  And that is what I've been going on with.  And...  And...  You got the liver cancer there, Tippy Tom?  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  How'd you get that?  Because...  No, they'll put needles in my stomach to pull out pieces.  But I know I'm going to live another 30 years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I told the doctor that.  You better stop drinking, hon.  Lady Di's telling Tippy Tom to stop drinking?  Are you insane?  No, I mean, if he has something wrong with his liver, he shouldn't be drinking.  Lady Di, look in the mirror.  Yeah, take it easy, Lee Remick.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Remick.  Drinking ain't had nothing to do with it. 
[03:44:30]  No.  Right.  No, no, no.  Drinking had nothing to do with it.  Just keep drinking, Tom.  It's not from drinking.  That's what I say.  All right.  Well, let's let Lady Di go.  Lady Di, you're not going to do anything with Tippy Tom?  I don't think so.  I think the appliance is a good idea because you don't have to use anything.  Yeah.  There's no skin-to-skin contact.  The appliance is the best one.  It's a strap-on type thing, and it's safe.  Well, we'll see.  Okay?  You know, that's something for me to decide.  I hope he doesn't have tuberculosis. 
[03:45:00]  I mean, you know.  What do you mean you need to decide?  Do you need to sit down and talk with your family?  Just do it.  No.  You want to put your strap-on in my ass?  No.  No.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I will think of something before I go on the show tomorrow.  That's the idea.  I think that's the one, the thing.  I think the little strap-on appliance is the best one.  Would you help me with that, Morton?  No, but it's not actually a section.  Lady Di.  What?  Come on on stage now. 
[03:45:30]  Lady Di.  Are you going to be up there tomorrow?  That's your face.  Jesus.  Guys, I will come up with something.  Don't worry about it.  Okay?  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  We are so out of dump.  It's ridiculous.  Tell Tom to take a break.  Hold on, Tom.  Tell Tom to take a break.  Tom, grab another beverage, man.  Yeah, go take a break.  We'll get you back in a minute.  Grab a beverage.  Go take a break, man.  Take a break.  You dropped something, Tom.  Can I F your face?  No. 
[03:46:00]  Not at all.  All right.  Goddamn.  Well, Lady Di, good luck tomorrow.  There it is.  Bye-bye.  Why is he pointing at me?  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom, come here.  Tippi Tom, sing your song before we go to break.  Yeah, Rod Stewart.  We're not getting on this beer.  What?  We got to talk soon?  Sing your Rod Stewart.  No, just sing your Rod Stewart.  What are your three choices?  My three choices of life?  You want to sing Rod Stewart?  You said you had three choices you were going to sing.  Oh, rock and roll? 
[03:46:30]  Or what category?  Hey, what are your three categories?  Look how calm he gets when he has a beer in his hand.  What category?  Category.  I left my heart.  That comes from mine first.  In San Francisco.  I left your colon in San Francisco.  Not to mention it's T-cells.  Yeah.  It calls to me.  Little cable cars.  Now, who am I singing about? 
[03:47:00]  Anybody got any idea?  San Francisco.  Tony Bennett.  What was his name before he was Tony Bennett?  Tippi Tom.  No.  No?  Well, his name was Anthony Benedico.  You know who gave him his name?  Wow.  I assume his parents.  No.  Bob Hope said, you ain't Anthony Benedico no more.  You are Tony Bennett.  Yeah.  Bob Hope.  You know who he is?  Yeah.  Of course. 
[03:47:30]  That's how he got his name.  Thanks for the memories.  Yeah.  That guy, Bob Hope.  Go ahead, sing.  Sing.  As we go to break, Tippi Tom.  Sing us out.  Little angel.  All right.  I need to belt one out here.  Belt one out.  Rock and roll.  Some rock and roll.  Some rock and roll.  Okay.  Let's go.  All right.  English or American?  You pick.  All right.  Hey.  If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, baby. 
[03:48:00]  Let me know.  Woo.  That.  Come, boom, boom, boom.  Who did that?  Rod Stewart.  Yes.  Yeah.  Your stomach has something in common with his.  All right.  We're at it now.  It's too easy for you.  All right.  All right.  Why don't you take a break, Tippi Tom?  All right, Tom?  Go out.  Enjoy your.  Oh, you got another?  Another song.  All right.  Give us another song.  Give us another song.  I got plenty of songs.  Well, give us one. 
[03:48:30]  I love music.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Let me think.  Let me think.  Let me think.  Let me think.  I'm tanking right now.  I'm tanking.  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  Two-time tanking.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Something that you might get.  Yeah.  If I go way back,  you're not going to get it.  Tom, just sing anything right now.  I want you all in the club  because I tell you right now,  Bing, be out of the club.  You can't guess this one here. 
[03:49:00]  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay.  Rock and roll 60s stuff.  60s stuff.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right.  Let's rock.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm out of the club.  No.  Okay.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  Stop cursing.  Here we go.  English band, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:49:30]  I'm out of the club.  You can't curse like that,  Tipper Tom.  Wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No more cursing.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hurry up.  I'm going to get hard and nasty.  All right.  Let's rock.  Go ahead.  We're going to get down.  American.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Riders on the storm.  You got it?  Yeah.  Is there anything you know more than three words to?  No.  Riders on the storm. 
[03:50:00]  He might know.  Into the...  It's the doors.  Come on.  Let's go.  It's the doors, but it's...  He got it.  Yeah, but we want you to sing it.  It's not a contest.  Hey, no.  Run away.  We're not playing trivial alcoholism.  Yo, I got a club.  He in the club.  Yo, I got a club.  All right.  All right.  You want some more rock and roll?  No.  Why don't you take a break?  All right, Tipper Tom.  Wait outside.  Enjoy your beer.  No.  I'm out here singing right now.  We're going to...  I'm not.  Enjoy your beer there, Tipper Tom.  We'll have you back in. 
[03:50:30]  He dropped something.  Thank you for...  All right.  We'll break and...  We'll try to get out of this tale.  We'll spin next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bring up some of the crazies.  I got a...  Oh, Robin Williams for you.  That'll freak out.  Okay, good.  We hate Robin Williams.  Everyone has the same take now, though, on Robin Williams.  He just talks and says things that make no sense, but people feel compelled to laugh.  If you really listen to what Robin Williams says, he's not saying anything funny.  That's what I love. 
[03:51:00]  The flight's like, help me!  Help me!  I don't know where we're going.  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  It sounds like an Italian and someone who's back from the 50s.  Okay.  Is that the way Jeffrey...  See that?  I don't know.  I'm not sure if it's a reference or not. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, my God.  They don't even make sense.  Now they're saying it's the same take we've always seen, but who cares?  It's not the same thing at all.  Of course, I say a couple of different things.  No, no, no.  It's not me.  All right, I've done that joke already.  Oh, my God.  People are like dying, laughing, rolling around, and I'm saying, they go, what is he saying?  I love it.  But he's not saying anything.  You want to work with him, don't you?  That's the key.  See?  You want to work with him.  I really do like Robin.  I really do say...  Yeah.  I get a lot of people who say...  I like the serious Robin Williams when he grows the beard and does...  But even without the beard, that's the greatest thing.  Well, it was a wonderful day here. 
[03:52:00]  All of us were having the same fun.  That guy called in and said to get me the F off the radio.  It's always wonderful when you can use a letter to make a whole word make sense.  I almost got that out.  Hey there, try the pause method, you know?  Okay.  But it's always amazing here at Opie and Anthony.  I mean, you know, sometimes it's full of energy and sometimes it's not. 
[03:52:30]  Sometimes it's 40 seconds of nothing and bleeped out because one guy said F this.  But he said the whole word and not just the letter.  That's exactly what he thought.  It's amazing.  It really is.  You know it.  Friends of the Opie and Anthony Show stay at the Park Central New York here in Midtown Manhattan.  Call 1-800-346-1359.  Spring rates starting at $189.

It's your mother, the woman who brought you into this world.  Hi, Ma.  I've been meaning to call you.  Really, Eric?  My phone has not been ringing.  I asked your father, has Eric died?

[03:56:00]  Details at participating stores.  Do you have thinning hair?  I bet you hate it, don't you?  I know I did.  But I decided I wasn't going to take it anymore.  I also knew I didn't want to go through the pain and expense of transplants or weaves.  And I didn't want to spend thousands on prescription drugs or risk the side effects they cause.  But I heard this commercial for Avacor.  And I realized Avacor had found the root of hair loss problems.  The problem is DHT, this bad body chemical that's the culprit in most hair loss.  And liquid Avacor deep cleans the scalp.  Avacor all-natural DHT blocker keeps that DHT from reaching the hair follicles.

[03:58:00]  Hey, Ricky, hope you don't mind, but I put the last couple of beers on your tab there, buddy.  No, no, no. It's all right, I guess.  Yeah, great, great. Listen, I'm going to hit the head, okay?  Ah, I'm not going to lose my temper with Dave tonight, because Dave's drinking Molson.  Yeah, Dave's been rather ill-mannered, spilling beer on my shirt, calling me chief,  and telling the ladies I have big biceps to make up for other shortcomings.  But seeing Dave with a Molson, a fine Canadian import, reminds me he's his own man. 
[03:58:30]  And that's just the kind of guy I need watching my back,  even if he did just put his skinny little hand on my sister's knee.  Yeah, I'm going to let Dave retain his dignity tonight, because Dave's drinking Molson.  Molson Canadian. Let your Molson do the talking.  The proceeding has been a wacky fictional portrayal.  Drinking Molson will not make you more likable, friend.  Imported by Molson USA, LLC, Golden, Colorado.
