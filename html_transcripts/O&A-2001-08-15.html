<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed the "Wow Summit," a motorcycle convoy from New York City to Philadelphia, fueled by the "Wow" phenomenon â€“ a belief that displaying a "Wow" sign attracts women to flash the driver. The show began by discussing this phenomenon, its previous success (and subsequent ban) in Boston, and its current New York popularity.  They juxtaposed this with a news story about a pedophile with Cheez-Its and child pornography on his computer, and then recounted a bizarre experience with the video conferencing company C-U-C-Me, whose advertising led them to numerous sites showcasing only naked men.  The abduction and rape of a teenage girl was also mentioned.

The focus then shifted entirely to the Wow Summit.  Several women were in the studio, preparing to participate in the ride alongside "Psycho Tim" from Boston. The hosts detailed the route, logistical considerations (including which tunnel to avoid traffic), and interacted with numerous callers providing updates and comments.  One caller shared a story about his girlfriend's hair falling out after bleaching.  Earl, a show employee, faced criticism for not participating, leading to a discussion about his relationship with the show.  Monique, a frequent caller, described smuggling contraband to her incarcerated boyfriend.  The Summit departed, with continued listener calls throughout the journey, interspersed with advertisements for Lifestyles Condoms and Sam Adams Beer.

The journey to Philadelphia was heavily documented via numerous calls from participants, the convoy growing from six motorcycles to over 20 bikes and numerous cars.  The in-studio guests included "the Stoners," who smoked marijuana, played broken foosball, and generally added to the chaotic atmosphere.  Laura, described as "mega hot," was also present, willingly discussing her body and sexual experiences on air, including her openness to showing her breasts and using marijuana.  A recurring comedic element involved speculation about Patty, a 44-year-old virgin participant, potentially losing her virginity due to motorcycle vibrations.  A caller reported state troopers pursuing the caravan.  Professional wrestler Bubba Ray Dudley called in to discuss his career and upcoming SummerSlam match.

Further calls detailed enthusiastic participation, frequently mentioning "big boobs."  A caller recounted a story about his boyfriend writing "pork" on his girlfriend's buttocks with self-tanner.  Laura's large breasts remained a frequent topic of discussion and humor.  Scorch, a radio host from Syracuse, called to arrange a date with Laura after expressing his intention to attend the Opie and Anthony magazine signing party in Manhattan.  A protracted argument between Earl and Matt Devote over a promotional contest ensued, with Earl's cryptic pronouncements becoming a running joke.  Otto and George, a comedy duo, joined the show, adding to the irreverent and offensive tone with their politically incorrect humor.  The show promoted their upcoming magazine signing at a Hooters location, mentioned appearances in various magazines (including a negative anecdote about a Time Magazine interview), and advertised Lifestyles Condoms Discs.

The Philadelphia leg of the Wow Summit saw more calls from participants, including Keith, who led a large group of vehicles.  Listeners continued to use explicit and offensive language; one caller, a self-proclaimed 13-year-old named John (mistaken for Sean) who idolized "Stoner Sean," discussed his drug use.  The hosts discussed Otto and George, whose outrageous acts were highlighted with a caller recounting an incident where George was stabbed during a performance.  A song by "Brother Joe" about Dickie Betts assaulting his wife was played.  Callers described enthusiastic crowds and women's participation in Philadelphia, with continued explicit references to nudity and sexual acts.  The hosts promoted their Hooters magazine signing and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. The broadcast concluded with expressions of excitement over the event's success.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, baby!  And welcome to the O&A Show for today, with about Wednesday.  Our phone numbers, if you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, we want to talk to you as well.  866-2774. Wow.  Once again, 866-2774. Wow.  Wow, the greatest radio promotion ever invented, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Absolutely.  It's spreading all over the country as the show gets syndicated to all these other cities.  Of course, our fine friends in Boston know that Wow started in Boston about six summers ago now.  Yeah.  Seems like yesterday.  Very simple concept. You put Wow in the back of your car.  We like the homemade Wow sign. Just write Wow in the dirt or in masking tape. 
[00:01:00]  You can get creative. We see some of you guys getting real creative with the Wow.  And then if the ladies feel like it, they'll flash you on the way home from work.  Yes, they will.  Works like a damn charm.  And just when it was going real well in Boston, our old station, AAF, chickened out and suspended Aunt Nye and told us never to do it again.  No more Wow.  We moved to New York and it's now a phenomenon.  Yeah, all over the place. People being wowed. They're loving it.  We have a wowed billboard in Times Square. That's how huge this thing has become. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  And the idiots from the AAF days had no effing clue how to handle it, so they shut us down.  That figures.  I can't wait for us to make AAF uncool, Anthony.  Well, yeah. It's obvious. I mean, Jesus Christ.  We made it cool to listen to AAF in Boston and now we're going to make it very uncool to listen to AAF in Boston.  You watch. Deal with it.  And so especially in Boston, we're looking for you guys to support the fact that we're back in Boston and put wow on the back of your car, okay? 
[00:02:00]  Right.  And you know that you will see boobs. Thank you.  Oh, my stupid computer isn't working.  Oh, I'm going to have to restart, Opie. Opie, I'm going to have to restart.  Go ahead. Restart your computer.  My computer.  Yeah, just kill it. There we go.  Maybe someone was trying to get rid of all the child pornography.  Was that it?  Oh.  There's some sick crap going on out there.  Well, it's obviously talking about that story that's been in the paper about the couple that abducted that girl from Massachusetts. 
[00:02:30]  Man. But this is just the tip of the iceberg kind of story.  And stuff like this goes on everywhere.  They prey on the lonely.  The lonely, full-figured teens.  Yeah.  The New York Post had to say she was a full-figured teen.  I mean, she was a fatty with low self-esteem.  Right.  Working in a mall.  You just troll the Internet for the little chubbies like that. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, like Opie said, low self-esteem.  And then you tell them some things they want to hear.  Before you know it, you're picking them up at their place of work at the mall.  And you're tying them up in your closet.  Right on the front page of the Post, they got a picture of this guy's lair.  The devil's lair, they call it.  The basement where he was doing all his dirty deeds, looking for little kids on the Internet and stuff.  That's a great ad for Cheez-It.  That's what I was going to say.  The fine folks at Cheez-It must be pretty psyched today, huh? 
[00:03:30]  The fine folks that put out the Cheez-It snacks must love that pedophiles love Cheez-It.  He likes the spicy Cheez-It.  Spicy Cheez-It?  Who puts out the Cheez-It?  Is that a Kellogg's brand thing?  What is that?  The Cheez-It.  Poor Cheez-It.  What?  I mean, you don't want to be seen there.  You want the president to be seen eating your Cheez-Its.  Maybe an athlete.  Imagine the call to the company today.  Okay, well, we got some good news and some bad news.  You got some good placement in the paper. 
[00:04:00]  Cheez-It.  Cheez-It has made the front page of the New York paper.  Prominently displayed.  Page one.  Can't miss it.  Everyone is going to see Cheez-It.  But the guy that was enjoying your Cheez-It product?  Pedophile rapist.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much on his desk top, along with child pornography, half-empty bottles of what  looks like Prozac or some kind of, you know, mental drug.  That webcam that everyone uses to, you know, check in on your grandkids. 
[00:04:30]  He's got the webcam pointed at where he would be sitting all naked.  Ah, give me some Cheez-It.  I love how they sell the webcams.  This is great.  See, what you do is, if grandma's living in Florida now, and she wants to check in on  the new baby, you tune in on the webcam.  Yeah.  How many people are showing, you know, children and whatnot on the webcam?  It's all junk. 
[00:05:00]  Remember that company that came on board when we were in Boston?  It was C-U-C-Me.  C-U-C-Me.  It was really the first type of software for this video conferencing over the internet.  I know what you're going to say, because we got, we got rucked in.  They're like, they're like, look, man, this is going to be, this is going to be, you know,  all over the place.  Everyone is going to have one of these cams on their computer.  I'm telling you, this was when no one had them.  No one had cams?  And they gave us the free software and free cams and stuff.  We hook it up and like, oh, and you go to all these rooms and. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And they'll be great.  It's going to be great.  You're going to be able to check out naked women and all this.  Because the selling point is, you know, this is a great tool for video conferencing.  You know, you could talk to family members, business associates.  And then he was like, and let me tell you, there are some sites you go to and there's  naked chicks going at themselves in front of these cameras.  I'll give you some of the sites.  Yeah.  Like, oh, this is the best thing ever.  So we hook it up in our office.  Can't wait to get on it.  Yeah.  And we find the menu of all these sites that support C-U-C-Me. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, oh, this is fantastic.  Click.  Click.  What?  What am I?  What am I seeing?  That's.  Oh, no.  That's guys naked.  Naked men cranking it in front of these cameras on every single link they sent.  And that's how, like, desperate we were to check out naked chicks back then.  Yeah.  Because we kept going through all the naked guys.  Had a troll.  Hoping that, you know, we'd eventually get to that pearl.  Nothing. 
[00:06:30]  Nothing.  I think we saw one fat chick and then a guy comes up behind her.  No one just starts.  No one happened.  Because I remember this like it was yesterday.  We bitched about it on the radio.  And some lady called up and said, all right, look, I got the C-U-C-Me software.  And she gave us a special.  Gave us a little special show.  And not everyone's getting the show.  And there she was at work.  Yeah.  Kind of, you know, helping us out with a little flashing and this and that.  So.  Not everyone was getting the show.  But the pedophile from our lovely area, there he is with this little freak. 
[00:07:00]  From Long Island.  There's his cam.  How does he, how do people think they're going to get away with this?  They kidnapped this chick.  They bring her to Long Island.  First they bring her to Rhode Island.  Then they bring her to Long Island.  And, you know, just raping her the whole way.  Then they decide they're going to lend her out.  Like send her, sell her to this guy in Queens, New York.  And he had her for a week.  And she was in the closet.  He tied her up like the gimp from Pulp Fiction.  Yeah.  They put her in some kind of black lingerie and high heels and a dog collar. 
[00:07:30]  He plugged her ears up and taped their head up so she couldn't hear any sounds.  And then gagged her.  And held on to it.  What do they think?  They're just going to let her go and, hey, okay, cool.  Hey, keep it quiet.  It's our little secret.  Yeah.  So now they're looking for other people that might have been victims.  Well, there it is.  I just think it's funny.  Cheese it.  Hey, cheese it.  Good placement.  Cheese it.  We got some great news.  Great placement.  You know, this happened to us. 
[00:08:00]  That's why I laugh.  And I swear the two are not connected.  You know the picture.  It's in our office.  There's a picture.  Oh, that's why you're laughing?  I thought you were laughing about someone else.  There's a picture on my cork board, Anthony.  Yeah.  Of a garbage truck with a huge wow on the back of the garbage truck.  Uh-huh.  This might have even been on the front page of the New York papers.  This garbage truck ran over a homeless person.  Yeah, ran over somebody.  Killed them.  With the shopping cart and everything where you see the shopping cart kind of under the, you know. 
[00:08:30]  Under the giant wheels of the garbage truck.  And our listeners thought it was, like, really cool that we got wow on the front page of the paper.  Dude, check it out.  You see the wow on the garbage truck that killed the guy?  You've got to love that when they're bringing in some criminal for killing people.  And he's wearing a t-shirt with a brand on it.  Right.  Like, Nike.  Just do it.  Right.  You know, he's got the Nike thing, a logo on there.  And he just wiped out a family.  Some guy arrested for pedophilia. 
[00:09:00]  And he's wearing a Scott and Todd t-shirt.  Imagine that.  An O&A wow shirt.  He's just wanted for the most heinous of crimes.  We wouldn't care, you know.  I don't care if criminals want to wear our shirts.  Hey, Keith the cop.  Keith.  We've been stalling because we were waiting for you to show up, man.  Keebler makes Cheez-Its Opie.  Keebler.  Keebler.  The little elves that live in the tree.  When I tell you that an old lady on a little rascal was moving faster through midtown traffic than we were.  Really? 
[00:09:30]  It's unbelievable today.  A little rough?  Unbelievable.  Just trying to get in here.  Well, we have the wow summit that's happening today.  You guys are about ready to leave for Philadelphia.  Yeah, we're just going to bring the girls down.  We've got the guys out here.  Now, I was reading an email before the show.  There's a bunch of people that want to join the convoy, the caravan, if you will.  Yeah, this is true.  Because I guess the wow summit is ending at a bar in Philadelphia.  So, man, you can go and have some fun with our Philadelphia listeners and see what they're all about today.  Yeah.  Where is it ending up, Ben?  It's ending at the Maui Entertainment Complex, which is on Delaware Avenue. 
[00:10:00]  And the doors are going to open at 5 o'clock.  Doors are going to open at 5.  Get there and, you know, greet the crew.  All right.  And Keith, if you don't know what's going on, he took it upon himself to come up with this wow summit.  He's got a bunch of guys with their Harleys, right?  Are they all cops?  Yeah, all the guys are cops except for...  Except for all the guys nodding, no, no, no, I'm not a cop.  Shut the F up, Keith.  I don't want to get in trouble.  So those guys aren't cops, right?  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. 
[00:10:30]  Of course.  Of course not.  Of course, we have Psycho Tim, guest rider from Boston.  Psycho Tim, Psycho Mark's brother.  Yeah.  Psycho Tim, Psycho Mark must be so pissed, man.  My brother's stealing my spotlight.  Gah, gah, gah, gah.  Tim, you got a bike?  Yeah, I wanted to thank the guys at the Lighthouse.  They gave me a $20,000 bike for the day.  Nice.  That's from Lighthouse Harley-Davidson and Buell.  670 East Jericho, Turnpike, Huntington Station.  That's fine.  631-427-0382. 
[00:11:00]  Whatever it takes to get this going on.  Tim, did you come from Boston?  Yeah, I drove from Boston because I thought, you know, for a summit you have to have all states here.  So the Boston represent, you'll be representing Boston.  Yeah, we're here.  And being Psycho Mark's brother, yeah, I can see how you would really represent Boston proudly.  And somebody gave me a motorcycle today, and they were going to put a hot girl in the back of my bike.  How much experience do you have on Harleys?  On Harleys?  Yeah.  Just, you know, a couple months.  A couple months? 
[00:11:30]  A couple hours.  What about the Riceburn?  Is there any experience on it?  Maybe about four hours again here.  Yeah, the Riceburns, they're completely different.  All right, but you've had some experience in the two-wheeled modes of transportation aside from a Schwinn?  Yeah.  Okay, very good to hear that.  And I'm not going to be doing any burnouts or wheelies or anything on the Harley today.  No.  Brand new?  So, yeah, it's got 3,000 miles.  Nice.  That's nice, man.  It's about 22, 23 grand.  Yeah.  Now, Tim, what's the buzz in Boston so far?  Guys, we're just ready to attack.  There's actually a ton of NEW Wow stickers all over the vehicles. 
[00:12:00]  In the Boston area already?  Boston area, yeah.  Well, BC on the station we're on in Boston, they're making up a ton of Wow stickers.  Yeah, you're going to start seeing these all over.  And, ladies, when you see the Wow, feel so inclined to lift your shirt and give the guy a little treat for the commute home.  Or the lady.  We've got to get these guys on the road.  So, what's the first stop where people could join the convoy?  Right outside the Lincoln Tunnel, we're going to hit the rest stop.  On the turnpike?  On the turnpike, yeah.  All right, the first one? 
[00:12:30]  The first one, yeah.  As you go south outside the Lincoln Tunnel?  Yeah, a little bit of traffic going through a tunnel, so it might take a couple more minutes than expected.  But, yeah, that should be the first stop.  All right, right on.  Taking the turnpike straight down to exit four, I believe it is.  You guys got cell phones, right?  We're going to check in with you all day?  Yeah, we're going to check in with you guys.  Philadelphia, we're coming.  And I'm looking at the girls outside the studio.  Nice.  Bring them in for a while.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Finally, look at us.  We're sharing.  Finally.  How many shows in Philly, Opie?  This would be our 50th show today.  50 shows today.  Look at an Opie nose. 
[00:13:00]  You neurotic son of a bitch.  I'm Rain Man.  50 shows.  50 shows.  When we hit 100, we're going to Philadelphia and doing the 100th show live for Philly.  Wow.  We're at the halfway point.  Look at this.  Who's the lucky one that got Patty?  Oh, Patty's here.  But Patty's going.  Oh, God.  Are you going, Patty?  You're getting on the back of a hog?  Look at her looking like a biker bitch.  The first hog she's ever going to sit on, I'll tell you that. 
[00:13:30]  Probably the last.  Yeah, look at you.  You're like someone's old lady.  They're trying to look like a biker bitch.  Do you have a tattoo property of Chainsaw?  No?  No.  Nothing like that?  No.  I'm ready to take my first ride of my life on a motorbike.  Yeah.  I got beat into the gang.  You got to get beat in and beat out.  So they beat me.  I got some.  Some guys had to unleash on me, if you know what I mean.  It's how you get into the biker gang. 
[00:14:00]  Usually when I see a tank top like that, it's usually hot.  Yeah.  I'm hoping to get together with the Hells Angels soon.  I have a small crystal meth plant in my house.  So, Patty, you're psyched for today?  Yes, I am.  Who has Patty on the back?  Who has Patty on the back?  Who has Patty?  Yeah.  You drew the short straw, my friend. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, Patty, there's a handle around front.  Hold on tight.  That's classic, man.  All right.  Who's who, Keith?  Where's Keith?  Here I am.  Do we get a quick flash or anything?  Yeah, if the ladies want, by all means.  Oh, wow.  Bravo, girls.  Oh, my God.  Beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  That's working.  Very nice.  That's working.  Very nice.  Who is everyone?

Oh, I said you were open.  Thank you.  Because you were.  You were talking too much instead of like, you're fine now. 
[00:15:30]  I did.  I said it, too.  I know, but you're a pussy to say it in front of her.  I came through at the end.  You came through?  Yeah, yeah, you guys did.  I'll tell you that.  It was very exciting indeed.  Hey, hold on a second.  Linda is already jumping in.  Are we going to get, like, police escorts through the tunnel?  Because Linda's saying there's a 50-minute delay.  No, of course not.  Oh, and look, Sean from Philly.  Do not send Patty here.  Oh, no.  Linda.  Linda.  Yes?  What's up?  Real fast.  Take the Holland Tunnel.  We'll stop.

What tunnel should we take?  There's a delay headed toward the lava room, but the food storage room tunnel's clear.  All right.  Who else do we have?  She's going to hold on with her mandibles.  Yeah.  I'm Barbie in a 36C.  Hi, Mom.  Barbie.

The four-click pen that is red, green, blue, and black that Opie was never able to afford  and envy the kids that had that in school.

It's the WOW Summit.  We've never done this before.  This is a gift from us to you.  And let me tell you, we want to tell the girls in Philly to make their way down.  We'll give you the final location, because I sure don't know it right now. 
[00:18:00]  Ben, what's the final location again?  And we would encourage the guys and girls from Philly to join the crew there and have  a little WOW exchange, perhaps.  Yeah, we want to see if we could all just get along.  Let's all get along with breasts.  All want to get along.  Yeah, the final stop is going to be at Club Maui.  Club Maui in Philly, and they're opening up the doors at 5 o'clock, right?  Open at 5, so go there and greet the crew.  The great peacemaker between the states.  All right.  Boobs. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  We have to take a break.  Keith and the gang, you guys are out.  Yeah, that's it.  We're heading out.  Hey, Philly, put your WOWs on your car.  Get a homemade one.  Get a WOW sticker, because if we're going to pass you by, you're going to be waving and  stuff.  You need the sticker on the car.  Ah, yeah.  Right on.  And you'll stop at that first rest stop if anyone wants to join the caravan, right?  That is true.  We can use an extra bike or two, actually.  All right.  Cool.  If you guys want to have join us.  I have a feeling you'll have a few people following you today, so.  You know, I hope some politicians take note on this, and maybe Israel and Palestine can  get together with boobs, hoping. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Right?  You send a WOW Summit over there, people would drop their weapons right away.  They saw beautiful boobs.  Brendan.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, yeah, you guys ought to bring that down to D.C.  You know, have your WOW Summit right in the heart of all the politics.  Well, we've only done like seven shows for D.C., and you guys still really don't know  what we're about yet.  Oh, I do, because we do a lot of work in New York.  In fact, we listen to you guys all the time.  When we build up an audience in Philadelphia, in Washington, we'll do something special,  all right?  That would be great. 
[00:19:30]  Right on, Brendan.  All right.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right, we've got to get them out of here, and we'll check in with you guys on the road  very, very shortly.

[00:21:30]  Yes.  What a great day.  We're stinky because he has some advice for our listeners.  Stinky.  He's coming in.  He's screening the phone calls.  Stinky, what did you want to tell the listeners about the WOW Summit?  Oh, that everyone's following the WOW van, which Earl is in, going to a sticker stop.  Actually, no, he's not.  Or somewhere.  Ah.  Do not follow the WOW van.  The WOW van is not involved with the WOW Summit.  It's not going to Philly. 
[00:22:00]  Also, Earl is not in there.  I don't even think the WOW van's doing anything today.  It just might be an intern or someone in promotions, you know, trying to get, like, you know, late or something.  Transporting narcotics?  Not true.  We have a sticker stop that Earl refuses to go on.  Oh, is that it?  Why did Earl refuse?  He told me to go F myself.  Is Earl here today?  Yes.  And why isn't Earl going to the Summit?  He's very popular and he's staying here.  How is he picking and choosing a job?  Imagine you're at your job and somebody that is of authority at your place of employment asks you to do something. 
[00:22:30]  And you tell them no.  Are you trying to say we have authority?  I'm saying that this show has authority.  I don't think.  No, I like to think we do have authority.  Authorita.  We have some authorita.  But it's in the best interest of the show, which in turn is in the best interest of all the stations.  Earl just doesn't want to be a team player with our show.  He absolutely doesn't.  He doesn't.  We all take it on the chin on this show.  I'm admitting that I'm whacking it and getting caught by my girlfriend the other day. 
[00:23:00]  Is that what you mean by taking it on the chin?  No?  No, no, no.  Teresa.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  How are you?  You guys, I'm just calling in.  It's a friend of the show and a friend of Earl.  You guys seem to be on his case a lot.  Oh, my God.  So I just want to, yes, from the bottom of my heart, I do love Earl.  And I simply want to tell Earl, wish him all of the best.  Teresa, we're on his case a lot because we want him to be part of the team.  The O&A team.  Yeah.  And he's not.  We ride everyone on this show. 
[00:23:30]  But for some reason, he cannot take it.  He should be going to Philly.  I think the Philly people enjoy Earl.  They enjoy the excitement he brings to Sticker's.  Ask him for your...  I can't even say it without laughing.  Ask him for yourself.  He's in the studio.  Earl.  Earl.  Teresa's on the phone.  She's very concerned.  Hi, Earl.  Are you there?  Yes.  How are you feeling?  I'm fine.  I hope you are.  I really do wish you well, Earl.  Sometimes you seem so down on the show. 
[00:24:00]  You know, and I just feel really bad about that.  Earl, you've got a lot of fans.  They want you to go to Philadelphia.  You're the only black one on the show, Earl.  I'm really wishing you well.  Are you a fine African princess, Teresa?  Are you?  We were told by...  Two strikes against you if you like Earl, then.  You're black and a chick.  Jim makes a good point on line seven.  I think it's time to kill off Earl again.  Oh, remember we did kill off Earl for a while.  We killed off Earl like an old-fashioned sitcom. 
[00:24:30]  But like Biggie, he just keeps coming back.  No one from the station.  Like Tupac.  He keeps coming out with albums even though he's dead.  Why does Tupac continue to come out with albums, Earl, when he's dead?  Maybe he's not dead.  I don't know.  Ah, conspiracy.  Earl, why aren't you going to Philly?  We were told by management we could not go.  None of us.  Really?  No one.  Told by management you couldn't go.  That was as per Jeremy Coleman.  It would be nice if someone told Ant and I these things because we could work them a little bit. 
[00:25:00]  I was told second-hand yesterday afternoon.  All right.  Well, Teresa, he's doing okay.  How long is the sticker stop going to be?  The summit, rather.  The summit's all day.  All day.  It's going to take a couple hours just to get there.  Oh, and I'm sure it's going to go well into the night.  So why can't it go into his personal time?  Yeah, Earl, go down there on your personal time.  Teresa, you want to go out with Earl?  Want to hook you two up? 
[00:25:30]  Sure, why not?  We could start out as friends.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Earl has enough friends.  If he wants to take me down to Philly.  He doesn't need any more friends.  Earl, take off your glasses.  You make us nervous wearing the sunglasses indoors.  Why are you wearing the sunglasses indoors nowadays?  He's trying to look intimidating.  It's kind of a new look for you.  You still look like Bobby Bonilla.  How intimidating can Bobby Bonilla be?  Even with sunglasses on, Earl.  All right, Teresa, he's doing okay today. 
[00:26:00]  He's much happier.  All right?  Okay.  I've got to cut you off because we're going to check in with the WOW Summit.  Okay, then.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  I think Rick's outside with the WOW Summit.  Rick.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  We're downstairs, and the girls are out here.  As you can hear, the motorcycles are blowing out.  Ah, yes.  It's like a freaking Hell's Angels meeting, for Christ's sake.  What a great sound that is.  All right, calm down. 
[00:26:30]  Calm down.  This is the sound of America right here.  Yes.  And we also have a couple of other guys on just regular bikes, I guess, that are going  to be joining them.  Okay.  And all the girls are in special shirts that I'm going to give a quick plug, if you  don't mind, to MK Custom Screen Printing Designs and Embroidery, not in Jericho.  They sent some very cool WOW shirts that they made up on their own.  We put them on all the girls.  Okay.  So they'll be on the backs of the bikes, and we'll be pulling out in just a few moments.  They're just getting a sign who's going to fit with who, and then we're going to be  rolling. 
[00:27:00]  So I'll call you back as soon as we're set to go.  Well, they've got to hurry up, man.  We only have three hours left in the show, three and a half hours left.  They're just strapping on their helmets.  The girls are just starting to get their helmets on, so I'll call you back in about a minute.  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  All right.  They're never going to leave.  And Patty joining them, which is just great.  What did Philadelphia do to us to deserve Patty?  I know.  Well, Philly there, you're going to see stalker Patty, who Jim Norton has described as having  the body of an ant. 
[00:27:30]  She's one of the chicks that are going to be there at the WOW Summit, which is just, it  doesn't make sense.  Oh, there you go.  Look at me go.  I'm a blanket chick.  Yeah, we're going to Philly.  I'm hardcore.  I'm going to put my big mandibles around my old man and flash, flash everybody on the 
[00:28:00]  back of the hog.  I'm sure I'm not used to sitting on hogs.  And I'm going to spit and curse.  Gosh darn it.  That's the last chick you'd ever expect to see on the back of a Harley for any kind of  trip.  I'm someone's bitch. 
[00:28:30]  Don't even try to pick me up.  Chainsaw's going to kill you.  Now I'm going to down some Jack Daniels and cut a Philly.  I'm going to be wild.  She's going to be mild.  I'm going to be retarded.  Born to be wild.  I'm going to be wild. 
[00:29:00]  Born to be wild.  I'm Patty and I'm rocking.  There she goes.  The wow summit and Patty's involved.  Kate, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  I don't know who I talked to earlier.  My phone is totally, it's almost ready to die.  I'm on a cell phone.  I drive a car for a living.  And I'm showing my boobs to everybody with these wows on the back of their truck. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And they're looking at me like I'm insane.  Like they don't know what it is.  So I don't know.  I think like kids are just writing it on the dirt in the truck.  I don't know.  I think that's the look of surprise, the look of shock.  The guy's thinking, oh my God, this really does work.  It's actually happening.  That's what's going on.  Yeah, because I have a wow in the back of my car.  I have yet to see some boobies.  It takes time, but it'll happen.  Kate, I've got to cut you off because Rick is checking in again from the wow summit.  All right?  All right.  You guys have fun out here. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  Very exciting, Anthony.  Let's see how far they have gone so far.  Oh, yeah.  Rick.  All right, guys.  This is a wow summit, Frank.  Brought to you by Matt's West.  We have moved about five feet.  And everybody's loaded up.  And you're going to hear that running around.  And here we go.  The wow summit is now officially underway.  Isn't this great?  We're sending New York and New Jersey boobs to Philly.  Oh, my God. 
[00:30:30]  Stinky rules.  Stinky rules.  I heard them there.  Stinky rules.  There they go.  Born to be wild.  Yeah.  Thank you, Rick.  You got it.  All right, man.  Don't piss me off.  I'm a tough bitch.  Ah, that's interesting.  I was going to say this to Patty.  Eric's got it, too.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Good to hear your voices. 
[00:31:00]  Listen, you think Patty might actually reach the big O?  I mean, that big Harley is like a giant vibrator.  You know something interesting you say that?  Some girls have reported that while they're on the backs of bikes,  the vibration gives them a little feeling.  And sometimes they've been worked to an O.  Well, that's the closest she's ever going to get to getting a big O.  All right, boys.  Take care.  Oh, my God.  This is fabulous.  Why does this feel so good?  Marmique. 
[00:31:30]  Marmique is Monique.  They can't spell.  How y'all doing?  Hey, Marmaduke.  What's up?  Hey, Monique.  What's happening?  They spelled your name M-A-R-M-E-E-K.  Well, in their defense, you are a black woman, and so who knows what the name's sometimes.  Yo, Marmique.  But it's Monique, the friend of the show.  Where's Latrine, Spatula, and Bactine?  We tried to get a cell phone to ring in a place on Monique.  Let's just put it that way.  That's right.  You remember that?  Hell yeah, I remember that. 
[00:32:00]  We wanted to see how well a cell phone reception was,  and if we could actually place a call from within a person, pretty much.  And there's only certain places you could put a phone where it would end up within a person.  And we tried it on Marmique here, Monique, and it was a person-to-person call.  No signal.  Opie and Anthony style.  No, we didn't get the damn thing to ring.  The cellular one veg you're trying to call is busy or out of the calling area.  So what's up, Monique? 
[00:32:30]  You know, she's riding a big vibrator.  She's going to have the time of her life.  Yeah, huh?  She may break out of her virginity.  You never know.  It could do something like that.  Yeah.  It could interrupt.  Although I think Ron Jeremy's hand, when he was in here last time,  might have done away with her virginity.  But, God, you know, that'll be really interesting to ask Patty if she's getting any kind of feeling.  A feeling she's never felt before.  Right.  A lot of people checking in from Philadelphia.  You should tape it.  We're going to end the WOW Summit at Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue. 
[00:33:00]  Doors open at 5.  Yeah, you should tape it.  We want to see a crowd out there to welcome the WOW Summit to Philadelphia.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Everything else all right with you, Monique?  Yeah, cool, cool, cool.  Yeah, when's Big Daddy getting out of the joint?  2003, going for parole.  2003 already?  Yeah.  Boy, the time flies, doesn't it?  I know.  Remember when we first got here and we talked to Monique and he had six years?  Yeah, now it's down to two.  Oh, man. 
[00:33:30]  We said a lot of nasty things about Big Daddy.  Jumping on the air a long time.  Now, Monique, the reason we were using Monique for the cell phone thing is because she had  told us stories about how she would smuggle various items of contraband into Big Daddy,  who's her boyfriend.  You can only imagine why they call him Big Daddy.  Yeah, Monique, can you refresh your memory?  What are some of the things you smuggled into the joint?  Some weed, some smoke.  That's what I call it.  A little alcohol.  I think weed.  Some little, you know, airplane bottles of alcohol. 
[00:34:00]  Airplane bottles of alcohol.  Airplanes.  Whatever you needed in the joint.  Yeah, you know.  A bottle of Jack.  Razor Blaze, whatever.  Some Cheez-It.  Cheez-It.  Salami.  Salami.  That's great.  She would kind of put her ankles apart slowly and it would look like an explosion at the Home  Depot.  Things would just come flying out.  Amazing.  Monique, are you getting action or what?  You're waiting for a...  Oh, no. 
[00:34:30]  I got my on the side stuff, you know.  He said as long as I don't catch nothing I can't get rid of, it's cool.  You know, I got to do me.  Hey, that's love.  Let me just say, that's what love's all about.  Monique.  Yeah.  Your conjugal visits ended a while ago.  Did you get him back?  No.  He's in the medium.  They don't allow that.  He's in the medium.  Yeah, but we do go out on festivals, you know, and the outdoors, you know, and when everybody  else is getting up to get chow, we get chow down on, you know. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, I got you.  See, they have these big things.  These are like the family can come in.  Yeah.  And kind of mingle with the prisoners.  Yeah.  And when everyone gets up to get chow, you go underneath the table or something?  Yeah.  You go underneath for a little bit.  And you get some chow on your own.  You go underneath, you know, behind the, you know, port-a-potty, wherever.  Wherever, right?  Inside, if you can hold your breath long enough.  Wow.  Any in-prison lingo slips you the meat shank.  Shank me, baby. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, Batman.  Shanked out in the yard with the meat shank.  All right, Monique.  All right, guys.  All right, Monique.  All right.  Don't be a stranger.  I won't.  All right.  All right.  There she goes.  We like the Monique.  Who's Rom?  Rom from Philly.  Rom.  Rom?  Rob?  Rob?  Rob.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Stinky can't hear today.  What's wrong with Stinky's ears today?  Yeah, we sent you guys Melissa.  And you guys are sending us Stalker Patty. 
[00:36:00]  Not just Patty.  We're sending a lot of chicks over there with great cans.  Don't you worry about it.  See, but Morris is the hottest chick walking the planet.  You should see the chicks we're sending you today, my friend.  We're making up with it.  We're making up with it with quantity.  I wonder if anyone has seen the WOW Summit go by yet.  We would love to hear from you guys today.  You know how many Baltic and Mediterranean make up a boardwalk?  That's what we're doing.  Melissa's like boardwalk.  We're sending you the whole side of the board after go. 
[00:36:30]  Well, that's cool.  Opie.  Yeah.  Oh, without the railroad.  I know you're a sports fan.  Did you root for the Giants this year so they can stank?  I don't like the Giants at all.  Well, please root for them because we know how your luck is and the birds want to win the Super Bowl.  Yeah, but see, you're still a little too new to the show.  The New York listeners, they know when I'm like fake rooting for a team.  It just has to happen.  Like, I'm going to be rooting for the Jets this year, my friend.  And they will do horribly because Opie's rooting for them.  That's a great picture, Rick.  Let me check out this pic.  This is as long as you don't root for the Philly teams, man. 
[00:37:00]  Hold on.  I'm checking out.  Yeah, that's good about syndication because I will not root for the Philly teams, which means you guys will do just fine.  That's a great shot of the WOW Summit leaving the building.  It's a front shot.  Rick's standing right in the middle of the street.  Unfortunately, not long enough because they didn't hit him.  Hey, I'm going to let you go, Rob.  All right.  Later on, guys.  All right.  Support the WOW Summit when it gets to Philly.  I'm definitely going to be there.  All right, cool.  All the bikes pulling out with all the chicks on the back.  How many bikes did we get to get that up?  Actually, there were, I guess, ten bikes that are Harleys, and then we picked up, like, two or three regular guys who just wanted to follow along. 
[00:37:30]  They got WOW in their helmet and everything.  Correct.  Yeah, anyone that wants to join this during the way, feel free, man.  How many pictures did you have?  I got a bunch of pictures with the girls, too, just getting all loaded up, so we got some good shots.  Scott's going to put them up.  Yeah, we'll put these up on opieandanthony.com, all right?  It was pretty wild, though.  You should have seen all the foreigners and the hot dog guy just freaking out with all the sounds coming out of these bikes.  Ah, why do you make noise?  Oh, yeah, they were freaking.  Trying to sell pretzels. 
[00:38:00]  Bah!  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, O&O, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I just want to tell you about the WOW Summit, man.  I got some guys.  We're coming down to go meet you guys there in Philly, give you some support.  Oh, cool.  Cool, man.  Yeah, listen, I got a question, guys, if you could do me a favor, maybe.  Mm-hmm.  My girlfriend, Kelly, she's coming down with me, but she had something kind of bad happen.  I'm not allowed to talk about it over the radio or anything, but I was wondering if you could just say hi to her.  I'm taping the show down in my basement.  Oh, is that what it is? 
[00:38:30]  It was an abortion?  Yeah, just say hi to my girlfriend.  Maybe I can get her to come out then.  Did he hear that, Opie?  Was it an abortion, Bob?  Huh?  Was it an abortion?  Nah, man.  Nah.  Sexual abuse?  Nah, actually, all right, I'll tell it, but I'll probably get killed for this later, but she went and she bleached her hair.  It fell out.  Yeah, I know, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh, no, that's terrible. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  Oh.  It's a little joke.  So.  Yeah, I know, it sucks.  Wow.  So, what color hair did she used to have?  It was black, and she decided that, you know, she called me up, and she's like, yeah, I'm going to dye my hair blonde, and I was like, uh, all right, dear, you're not going to bleach it, are you?  She's like, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:39:30]  And what did she use?  What happened?  How did it happen?  She used bleach.  She used bleach.  She used Clorox-type bleach.  Yep.  Stuck it on her head.  That's what I guess.  I don't know the exact of it.  She just, she called me up a couple hours ago while I was at work.  Why didn't you go to the beauty parlor?  Yeah.  So.  She tried to do it herself.  Uh, I don't know.  I think she might have had her mom help her with it or something.  I don't know if she didn't do it herself.  So what does she look like now?  I don't know.  I'll find out. 
[00:40:00]  Does that sound like her in the mirror?  I'm sure she's still beautiful.  That is your name.  Hey, Bob?  Yeah.  What'd you say?  I said, I'm sure she's still a beautiful man.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Nice head, dick.  She's gonna kill me.  So, she's gonna go to Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue today? 
[00:40:30]  With a hat.  Yeah, I'm gonna try to drag her out there.  She's gonna wear a hat?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  She's gonna put one of those scarfs on?  Uh, hey, that's up to her, man.  I mean, I told her she should dye it all orange and then put leopard spots on it.  Yeah, but most of it fell out, right?  Most of it fell out, she's gonna shave it down now, I guess.  I'm not sure.  Oh.  Like, probably came out in clumps. 
[00:41:00]  And you're gonna have to make believe it doesn't look that bad.  No!  I mean, it looks great!  I've dated chicks with short hair before.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mish.  All right, Bob, we'll see you down there, right?  All right, thanks a lot, man.  All right.  You guys take lots of pictures and send it to us so we can put it on the website.  All right.  You are even more stupid than I first computed.  Yeah.  Little song for, uh, little song for Bob's chick. 
[00:41:30]  Hold on.  Bob's chick bleached her hair and it fell out.  Right.  You got it.  Goddamn, you girls, what you do to look hot.  I'm gonna look all hot with my new blonde hair.  All right.  She wore it well.  It's been seven hours and fifty days.  Oh, that's great.  Nice head, Dick. 
[00:42:00]  Okay, terrific.  That's what you say when you see it for the first time.  Okay, terrific.  That's a winner.  Oh, ah.  Anyway.  What the hell were you thinking?  Tangley.  Sweet, merciful crap. 
[00:42:30]  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  But nothing, I said nothing.  That's great.  Looking like Sinead.  Because nothing compares to you. 
[00:43:00]  Emergency.  Yeah, that's horrible.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  The big yellow one's a son.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  All right.  All right. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Ouch.  I hope she enjoys this one, too.  She's sitting there in a basement.  A boyfriend called.  She wanted us to cheer her up a little, I guess, and say hi.  How's that for a topper?  Yeah, you know this. 
[00:44:00]  What's this, Midnight Oil?  Yeah, remember the singer?  Bald as a cue ball.  Yeah, Peter Garrett.  You probably look a lot like him now when you look in the mirror.  That's a winner.  Yeah.  That's good.  Looking hot.  Natalie, what's going on?  Natalie.  Natale.  Natale.  Natale, come on.  What's going on?  I just saw the caravan go by.  You saw it where?  I saw it right outside the tunnel. 
[00:44:30]  And those guys are wearing leather straps?  Jay Crash.  Uh, what?  Those guys are wearing leather chaps?  I don't think so.  Where are you going with this?  I was just wondering why you guys have WOW.  You know, WOW was a brand of chips that gave you explosive bowel movements.  Oh, okay.  Hey, uh, that's good.  No, that's, come on.  Okay, there you go.  Dean, what's going on?  Nah, they're on 11th Avenue. 
[00:45:00]  Get ready to get into the tunnel.  There's all kinds of traffic.  All right, we'll see if they can pull some strings.  You got it.  Hey, thank you, Dean.  No problem.  We should take a break.  There's an update from the WOW Summit.  Very cool.  Headed toward the Lincoln Tunnel as it heads down to Philadelphia.  Yeah, where am I going in?  I was just lying, 10.  Oh, hold on.  Uh, Dennis.  Yo, Obi.  Yeah, what's up?  Yo, me and me and Sean are outside the studio.  Wait, you're our stoner friends from last week?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  I didn't even know you guys were coming in today.  Yeah, dude.  So, what's up?  You going to do the show with us?  Uh, yeah, as long as my truck doesn't get towed.  What?  We're outside.  I stopped the tow truck driver, dude.  He had that thing on the lift.  What?  You don't have any money to park?  I don't know where to park, dude.  All right, hold on.  Rick will take care of you, all right?  Thank you, buddy.  All right, our stoner friends have decided to come up and say hi, Ant.  They just drive up?  Yeah.  We should take a break.

What one has to do with the other, I don't even have to know.  Boy, you think my Mets will make it this year?  Yeah.  It's looking really good, Opie.  Shut up, Rick. 
[00:47:30]  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams, yes.  Whether it's the lager, the summer ale.  Oh, my God.  I was drinking some of the, what the hell was the other stuff they had?

They're going to end up at Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue.  Doors open at 5.  We're getting reports that they're through the tunnel already. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah?  Here's our offering to a Philly of breasts.  Here's a guy waiting on the turnpike.  Ed, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm going to be waiting on the South Broad Street turnpike overpass with a big wow sign for him.  Oh, I like that idea.  Oh, yeah.  The overpasses.  Right next door to the turnpike.  All right.  We could kind of do some overpass stuff like they did with the OJ thing.  Yeah.  See what I can do.  Go, OJ.  Go.  Right.  You want me to call in again when they get here?  Yeah.  We want to get reports from the roadway. 
[00:49:30]  So if you see the wow summit out there, please call us.  Sure.  All right.  I wish Keith would check in so he could see where their progress has led them to.  Probably a little difficult on the bike.  They want to, you know, get going a little ways before they check in.  Oh, good point.  You know how that works?  Well, we got to say hi to a bunch of old friends, new friends.  Yeah.  Girls that want to flash outside the studio.  First of all, we got to say hi to Scorch.  Look who's in the studio today, Scorch.  And you didn't blow me off, man.  No. 
[00:50:00]  So impressed, dude.  Well, Monday we took the day off and you would come down here from Syracuse.  Yeah.  We forgot we invited you down.  So we drove all the way from Syracuse and you met Stinky.  And Stinky goes, they took the day off today.  And needless to say, it was just well worth the trip into the city.  But hey, look at it.  Look at you guys go, man.  Good for you.  And we greatly appreciate that you're keeping your clothes on.  I know you're not used to doing radio with your clothes on, Scorch.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  But thank you.  I'm just waiting for the wow girls to come in. 
[00:50:30]  My clothes go off with theirs.  Yeah.  But I brought my own Stinky with me.  I wanted you to like...  This is your version of Stinky when you do your morning show in Syracuse?  This is my version of Stinky.  And what's his name?  His name's Gooner.  He can speak for himself.  Gooner.  Hi, man.  Nice to meet you.  And what do you do for the Kingdom of Nakedness?  Anything I ask him to.  Oh, yeah?  Not many people, you got to admit, not many people will do everything.  That's true.  And he doesn't question it.  Good soldier, man.  That's a very good thing to have. 
[00:51:00]  Including getting kicked in the chest.  I mean, his chest caved in by an ostrich trying to steal an ostrich egg.  Nice.  That's a good bet.  We might have to steal that one.  That was fun.  His dad called me up.  His dad's like, Jesus Christ, my son effing got kicked with a buzzard egg.  A buzzard.  His dad is like...  You listen to him.  His dad is like an older version.  Hey, man, how's it going?  So, you tried to steal an ostrich egg.  Yeah, I was stealing the egg from an ostrich.  See, we got you beat.  It was pretty cool. 
[00:51:30]  And he got pissed off.  Oh, yeah.  He ticked my ass.  We got you beat.  We had a Siberian tiger in the studio on Friday.  Good for you.  Yeah, a little Siberian tiger.  I went to step past him and he grabbed...  I swear to God, he grabbed my leg and put his mouth right around my calf.  Went to bite him.  I'm like, how many times in your life do you go, hey, I got a tiger on my leg?  He's like biting me.  This thing wasn't trained.  This thing wasn't like...  No.  Because I once wrestled a bear.  Oh, you did?  I once wrestled Victor the wrestling bear.  And that thing just whooped my ass. 
[00:52:00]  I was watching the trainer.  Usually what happens is when you walk into the ring, the trainer lets the bear go.  So I said, okay, now if I walk into the ring and kind of run around the bear, the bear's  knocking...  That bear swatted me and I was in the ground in seconds.  Oh, you had a strategy before you went in.  Right.  Anyway.  We got to go to the phones real fast.  Keith is at the first rest stop.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How are you?  Hey, man.  Wow Summit Report.  Sponsored by Sam Adams.  I don't know.  This is the Alexander Hamilton rest stop.  Okay.  As you can hear, everybody is very excited to see us here. 
[00:52:30]  We just picked up about six more motorcycles, four or five cars.  Cool.  How many...  We're heading right out.  Wait, wait, Keith.  How many bikes are you up to?  You got to keep track of the bike total.  We got two, four, six, eight, twelve, fourteen now.  Fourteen.  Yep.  And that's at the first stop.  We started with six.  We got about 14.  We picked up about six or seven cars.  All right.  Where's the next stop, Keith?  We're going to pick a spot someplace down on the turnpike to be determined.  Okay.  Let us know.  I'll let you know.  I'll take it again.  Keith. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  What's up?  Is there any way we could quickly talk to Patty?  Um, Patty had to use the little girl's room.  Oh, all right.  At the next stop, we will definitely check in again.  Okay.  Keith, we got to let you know what we're getting at.  We have a feeling that Patty might have had her first O ever.  Uh, and seeing that she ran to the ladies' room, there might be something going on.  Yeah.  She kept going, I love it.  It's the best feeling I've ever had.  Ah!  Ah, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Our 40, what?  Four-year-old virgin.  She's 44.  She's a virgin.  Uh, never had the pleasure of a man meet or anything like that.  And now she's on the back of a Harley going to Philly.  And the vibrations, yeah, they kind of get to the women sometimes, right?  All of a sudden, they're getting that big beast between their legs, just shaking like that.  Patty's never felt anything like that before.  Right on.  Look at the bike she's riding on.  It's a little damp.  I just have to think of the edge from you, too, and I'm set. 
[00:54:00]  That's like the guy she fantasizes about all the time.  The edge.  All right, Keith, we got to let you go.  Get back on the road.  All right, we'll take a little bit.  All right, cool, the WOW Summit, as it makes its way to Philadelphia, I'm cutting Keith off  because now Kelly's calling in.  What a great soap opera we got going on today.  I like this a lot.  Kelly?  Yes?  Kelly, you're the one.  Your boyfriend just called before break.  You bleached your hair and it all fell out.  Yeah, I did.  I had to cut it about an inch short all over my head.  Nice head, dick.  Yeah, but I just want to say that my boobs are so awesome as hell, so that's what I'll be 
[00:54:30]  showing off at the WOW Summit in Philly.  Hey, Kelly, what were you thinking?  I don't know.  When you put regular bleach?  Not bleach, bleach, hair bleach.  Hair bleach.  Oh, okay.  Your boyfriend made it sound like you just took some Clorox and poured it on your head.  So you took hair bleach and what went wrong?  It just fell out.  Your hair, like did it come out in clumps or all at once?  No, all in clumps.  It must be a hottie now.  So you didn't have the Michael Jordan look. 
[00:55:00]  You had the chemo patient look.  No, it's not that short.  Well, you said it's like an inch now.  Yeah, but it looks good.  How pissed are you at your boyfriend that he told 12 cities that you had your hair full on?  No, he did it because he loves me.  All right.  Yeah.  You're going to be at the WOW Summit?  Yeah.  In Philadelphia there?  Definitely.  All right.  There you go.  Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue starting at 5 o'clock.  Awesome.  All right.  Cool.  Yes, thank you.  Thanks, Kelly.  All right.  She doesn't sound that busted up about it. 
[00:55:30]  That's all right.  Anthony, as we move on, we've got to introduce all the players that are going to help us out  with the party today.  The Stoners are here.  Yeah, the Stoners showed up.  You've got to get Stinky because Stinky hit it off.  Stinky was kind of taking a couple days off when we met the Stoners.  Yeah.  And Stinky met the Stoners today for the first time, right?  Yep.  How psyched are you, dude?  That's awesome.  Right.  I'm waiting for Dennis to show up.  This is Sean, right?  Yeah.  What's up, Bo?  Hey, Sean.  What's up?  Hey. 
[00:56:00]  What's happening, guys?  Here's Anthony.  What's happening, bro?  What happened to your fifth man on the foos table on the purple side?  It broke.  I know.  Well, you know something?  It makes an order.  Might as well put the word out now that you brought it up.  If anybody owns one of those home entertainment shops or wherever you would buy a foosball table,  men, we need, like, extra foosball men because now they're snapping because everyone's getting  their hot shot back.  Right.  And they're snapping men.  So we might need an official Opie and Anthony foosball table repair guy. 
[00:56:30]  So, Sean, your first impression of the place.  You met Stinky?  It was awesome.  Stinky truly rules, right?  Hey, Wayne, God, what a surprise that is.  In the first five seconds I was here, I was out in the stairwell smoking.  On the stairwell.  We were smoking out of his Home Depot bowl that he made for $2 with, like, two different  parts.  Dude, let me see the Home Depot bowl.  No doubt, man.  Here it is, man.  $4 at Home Depot.  Let me see.  I used to make my own pipes back in the day. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  You got some plumber fittings here.  Some, uh, yeah, these are like tubing fittings.  Looks like a wrench.  I was in Home Depot and a threaded thing.  And a guy's like, those threads don't even fit together.  You can't do that.  What are you doing with this?  I don't care.  No, it's awesome.  And then I could tell, like, the threads might have been a little harsh getting hot on  your fingers.  So you wrapped it in twine, dude.  How cool is that?  And what, did you sew the stuff on there yourself?  Yeah, it was pretty high when I did that. 
[00:57:30]  Dude, I put the twine around it, but it's unraveled.  Well, I'm going to sew it with blue thread.  It's going to look kick.  You know where I'm coming from, man.  You're picking up what I'm putting down.  Right on, man.  What a pisser.  That's scorched, Sean.  Scorched.  Totally nude.  Yeah.  He's not nude, though, bro.  The kingdom of nakedness.  Yeah, the kingdom of nakedness.  Ooh.  Now, where's your butt?  He's out paying the ticket because the car. 
[00:58:00]  What happened, man?  We were at Hooters getting all loaded up before the show, man.  And we walked out and the car was getting towed.  Wow.  So all of a sudden he starts running.  I'm like, where are you going, man?  I got a car in the car.  Whoa.  No, I wouldn't do that, man.  Yeah.  Never.  You got to keep it close at hand.  Never.  Right.  He makes the pot fit.  That's why I was in his car.  Yeah, everybody does the pot thing.  It doesn't work over the radio.  I know.  Dude.  So they were towing the car and he's getting this car back, right? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  He was up there.  He's like, oh, I think I still got to pay the ticket, but at least it's not going to  get impounded now, man.  Yeah, that sucks, man.  And they take it down to the west side.  You got to get it out of an impound and it costs a lot of money.  And you guys don't have much money, right?  Nah.  Nah, I quit my job.  It was sweet, dude.  We're going to give him a case of Sam Adams, right?  Yeah, give you some decent food.  Can I have one now, man?  I'm so thirsty. 
[00:59:00]  The little parts.  We might be able to scrape something up for you.  We can do that.  On the lowdown.  On the DL.  There's a lady outside that wants to wow us.  I heard.  I was playing foosball with her.  She's mega hot.  Yeah.  She's mega hot.  Yeah, she is.  Hey, there she is.  Hey, what's up?  Her name's Laura.  Wow.  Laura.  Hi.  Nice guns, huh?  I beat the stoner in foosball.  Did you?  Yeah.  He didn't have the five man, though.  Yeah.  Right.  I'll tell you, we are all getting our shot back on this game and it's getting to be real  competitive during the commercial breaks. 
[00:59:30]  So you beat him.  I did.  How hard is it to beat the stoner guy?  Look at the ball.  Oh, it's just all over the place, man.  I can't get my goalie on, man.  No, I don't know what's going on.  Oh, it was a crazy time, man.  Hey, it's a new website guy.  Yeah.  Steve C.  That's Steve C. from foundrymusic.com.  Sure.  Hey, are we going to take pictures of Laura when she flashes us for the website?  All right.  That's great.  Now, Laura, your mom's listening?  My mom is listening.  Mom, I have a bunch of guys. 
[01:00:00]  Boobs.  Boobs.  Right, a bunch of guys here that are going to see your boobs.  You want to tell your mom?  You're cute.  How tall are you?  Like five, six.  Five, six?  And those are full C's.  Maybe D's.  I would say D.  They are D's.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely D's.  I was wearing a nice little, very skimpy wow t-shirt.  I thought the other day I was blessed because they're perky without a bra, but that's probably  just because I'm 20 still.  Oh.  Yeah, well, the age, time.  Well, there's something to that, sure. 
[01:00:30]  Time plus gravity equals saggage.  True.  Is what they say, yeah.  All right, let's check out Laura's boobs.  Let's see these 20-year-old.  Oh, wow.  20-year-old D's are by far the best D's you will ever see.  They don't have them in Syracuse.  No?  No.  Wow, those are really nice boobs.  Thanks.  Very nice.  Are you proud of them?  Sure you are.  I am very proud of them.  Of course you are.  I'm proud of them myself.  Scorch, what do you think of that nakedness?  Hey, Stoner, Stoner Sean, what's up? 
[01:01:00]  You like that?  Yeah, you know what that is, man?  Huh?  Totally nude radio.  Yeah.  He's cracking up, Stoner.  These guys are going to get along just fine, man.  Right out of the fast times at Ridgemont High Van.  You're up with what I'm putting down.  Me and Laura are going to go get high pretty soon.  Laura, you like...  Smoke weed every day.  You partake in a little weed every so often?  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  Your mom's listening, so...  My mom does it, too. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, your mom smokes the weed?  That's good.  Does your mom have boobs like that?  No, no.  No.  She's cute and petite.  She's real nice looking.  She has no boobs.  Yeah.  So, do you have a steady boyfriend or anything?  No, I don't have a girlfriend.  You don't?  You have a girlfriend?  No, I don't have a girlfriend.  I would say that's usually the second question I ask.  But now, when you're with guys and you take those out, do you just laugh at the guy?  I have to tell you, I have never, ever flashed anybody before.  I mean, when you go to bed with a guy for the first time and you take your shirt off, 
[01:02:00]  do you just laugh at the guy's reaction?  Because it must just be like...  Yes.  Yeah.  And do the guys really like the TF?  Yeah.  They just want a TF?  Well...  What?  Hey, what's up, man?  You're interrupting.  Cool.  Wait, hold on two seconds.  We're at the TF question.  That's the other stoner that just got his car back.  So, the guy's like that?  I've never done that before.  You've never done that? 
[01:02:30]  No.  Swear to God.  Oh, my God.  Look at the stoner guy volunteering.  Wow.  How does that work that you have those?  It's like leaving a Ferrari in the garage without gas.  Well, yes.  I haven't done it yet.  Haven't done it yet.  There's plenty of time after it.  Until you have a yam bag flapping on your breastplate and banana juice, leaving a pearl necklace.  Because those are perfect for the TF.  Wouldn't you agree?  Hell yeah.  Of course you would.  Of course you would. 
[01:03:00]  Got to get her pictures up on the website, man.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Can I tell you?  Actually, I have a question.  Yeah.  No, I have a statement.  You guys should give me a job.  Give you a job?  Oh, you're hired.  You guys should give me a job.  You guys should give me a job.  Okay.  Okay.  Because here's the difference.  No?  Okay.  Sorry.  Maybe that one.  I was listening yesterday and I heard how our buddy Earl wasn't doing a very good job  with the sticker stops.  No.  Just nothing.  Why not a hot, young 20-year-old do it or go with him? 
[01:03:30]  Hey, you're hired.  Right?  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Well, did you possibly need a couple of joints and we're in?  Yeah.  I'm serious.  He's like, I got a couple of joints, man.  Do you have anything against being tied up in leather, black leather in the closet with  a leash around your neck?  And can we sell you to other people around the locations?  No.  No?  No.  Okay.  But I'll get great publicity.  I think we're going to send you to the next WoW sticker stop. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  That sounds good.  Hold on one sec.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Sean is smoking my pot.  What?  Sorry about that, man.  I know I snagged it.  Hey, dude.  The guy's being generous with other people with your pot.  It's not even like he's smoking.  Hey, dude.  Do you want to smoke?  I know.  He's smuggling it.  Yeah, I just wound up in my pants this morning, so it's like mine, man.  You know?  Well, something must have happened to it, man.  Come on.  I don't know where it went, man. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I definitely stole it.  No shirt, no shoes, no dyes.  Oh, no.  You got a cigarette?  I got like a nickel ad.  All right, Rob.  Yo, did you ask Sean if you brought Carissa porn?  Oh, no.  No, her boyfriend's just saying, shut up, dude.  Dude.  We'll find out what all this means.  Yes, we will.  We'll do it on the break.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, I just stood at the stop at the rest area. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  The only one that didn't wow the group was Patty.  Well, thank God.  Thank God.  Who cares?  What do you think of the girls that are involved with the wedding?  Pretty hot.  Yeah, they're nice.  The guy riding, the chick riding with Keith was pretty hot.  Yeah, Philadelphia is going to be very happy today in a couple of hours.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pete.  All right.  Bye.  And that's all the players for today, Anthony.  That's great.  What a rip.  We're playing this.  A video game guy.  All right, we're going to play this.  Oh, I know this. 
[01:05:30]  Go.  One, two, one, two, three, four, noise, noise, noise.  Smoking weed, smoking weed, doing coke, drinking beers, drinking beers, beers, beers.  Rolling fatty, smoking blunts.  Who smokes the blunts?  Who smoked the blunts?  Rolling blunts.  It's a big blunts.  Let me get a nickel back.  Fifteen bucks, little man.  Put that in my hand.  If that money doesn't show, then you owe me, owe me, owe me.  Nice.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Jay Moore's checking in from Cleveland.

It really means Whip Them Out Whenever.  Oh, we focus on it on Wednesdays.  Yeah.  Real easy.  Just put Wow on the back of your car.  Some of the stations we're on, they're getting bumper stickers made.  We love seeing the homemade Wow signs.  If you put it on your car, you have a really good chance of seeing something when you're  stuck in traffic hating life. 
[01:08:00]  And we're getting reports from all over the place.  Wow going on in Philly, Cleveland.  Nice.  Nice.  Let's check in with our buddy, Jay Moore.  Jay!  Gentlemen.  What's up here in Cleveland?  I'm officially doing recon for you in Cleveland.  Nice.  And I would like every lady in Cleveland to know that I don't need the sticker.  I am a walking Wow affiliate.  Yeah, if you see Jay Moore, you just wow him.  Just Whip Them Out.  If you get arrested, I'll get you out of jail in two hours. 
[01:08:30]  Cleveland, Jay.  How funny is it that the stone guy in the studio is like, hey, your fifth man on the  foosball table is broken.  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted.  I know.  These guys are hammered wasted.  And they're howling, man.  They're funny as hell.  They come in and that's the only thing they notice.  There's so much going on here today.  We got girls getting naked.  We got people jumping on the Harleys going to Philadelphia for the Wow Summit.  And he notices the foosball table.  Yeah, the guy's broken. 
[01:09:00]  I think that's a good idea, though, to get your own official sponsor for games in the  studio.  Hell yeah.  Because everyone's getting their shot back.  Anthony was killing you yesterday on that shot.  I got Anthony's move down a little bit today.  I got the reverse pin pull shot that's working really well.  What am I saying, Norton?  I learned that one out at a couple of the bars out on Long Island many years ago.  Cleveland's beautiful, man.  What a great city to be syndicated in.  This is really nice.  Nice summer right on Lake Erie.  Nice hotel room.  But we've been here five minutes. 
[01:09:30]  Frosty already broke his bed.  How did he break his bed?  He shut the door to his room and the bed board fell off the wall.  Wow, you're in one of those expensive hotels, huh?  1313 Mockingbird Lane.  Motel 6.  That's where the Munsters live.  We flew in with Run DMC.  Did you?  Oh, yeah?  And they were talking about Otto and George, I swear to God.  So how does Run DMC stack up when you're talking about that plane goes down theory that you got about if you'd be in the paper or not?  I'm a little ahead, I think. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, because I don't have any bad albums out.  So if the plane goes down and Run DMC dies?  No, there's only one of them.  Oh, okay.  It was just Run.  So you would get top billing in that crash, right?  I think I would hope so.  Yeah.  Because I'm more of a renaissance guy than Run.  There you go.  I do the voiceover, the acting, the comedy.  You know, I breakdance if I have to.  I do it all.  Right.  And they were talking about Otto and George?  They were talking about Otto and George.  But they were just crazy.  They're like, there's a white dude with a puppet. 
[01:10:30]  He was dirty.  And I go, you mean Otto and George?  And he goes, no, a white dude with a puppet.  Otto and George.  Yeah, he was funny.  There's a white dude with a puppet.  I was like, all right, you know what?  I'm out of this conversation.  We shared a limo ride back to the hotel.  I think Otto's coming in today, Jay.  That's why I called.  I thought that was so hot that you guys could tell him Run DMC are actually saying how funny he is.  But they didn't remember his name even when I said it six times.  That's very cool.  Well, one of them's a reverend now.  Run's a reverend.  Reverend Run? 
[01:11:00]  That's a lot of weed coming out of that holy roller.  Boy, most people just decide to go the born-again route when you've really tied on a good one for your life.  When you're becoming, like, part of the clergy.  Anthony, I figured it out.  Yeah.  Tax-free.  Oh, is that it?  Why else?  That's smart.  Why else?  You know, come on.  Hey, Jay, hold on the line for a second.  Okay.  We have breaking news.  Hold on.  Let's go to Scott and see if this is legit.  Scott, what's up?  Yo, what's up, you tools?  Hey, man.  I just got off the turnpike at exit 11, and the troopers are flying after the guys on the turnpike. 
[01:11:30]  No.  I want to check in with them.  Yeah.  No.  They're flying after the Wow Caravan?  Yes, they are.  It had to be them.  There's, like, 50 bikes.  We're not doing anything illegal?  What, trooper motorcycles?  No, not trooper motorcycles.  Troopers and cars going after the motorcycles.  See what happens when you don't graduate high school.  Yeah, that must be it, Scott.  That old gag.  All right, I'm going to hang up so I know what to listen to my...  There you go.  How about we just hang up? 
[01:12:00]  That sounded a lot like a gay Jeff Norris.  Yeah, sorry to interrupt you with that, Jay.  Is that Jeff Norris with a fake name?  I don't know who that was, but...  So you're psyched for the shows in Cleveland?  I'm psyched.  I'm performing for the Cleveland Browns tonight with Run DMC, and it's real hush-hush, but  I don't know anything about the Browns, so I was looking through, like, all the rosters  and stuff, and a couple guys went to Harvard, so I got a couple jokes for the offensive  linemen went to Harvard.  I was thinking of saying, I'm sure when your parents spent $200,000 for you to go four 
[01:12:30]  years at Harvard, they had an idea you'd have a job where you showered next to a guy  with breasts.  I'm sure...  One guy went to Walla Walla Community College.  How the heck did he get in the NFL?  Walla Walla is an old Indian word that means no blacks on campus.  Oh!  You ever been to Walla Walla, Washington?  It's the whitest place in the world.  Never been there, Jay.  Mark Furman could open up a bait shop and be a millionaire in that town.  Got any Corey Stringer jokes yet, Jay?  No, too soon, eh, Opie.  Too soon.  Too soon, yeah. 
[01:13:00]  We don't really know that formula yet, you know?  Yeah, it's a little too soon.  He was a man, he's got to kiss somebody's dad, you know?  We realize it doesn't matter how huge the tragedy, as long as enough time goes by, you  can goof on it.  Well, princess dying in the tunnel now, it's fair game.  No, I mean, you look even further back, the whole Titanic thing, we had just talked about  this about a week or so ago.  Now it's a ride at parties and carnivals.  The big sinking Titanic ride.  It's a blow-up ride.  Oh, I know that ride.  It's also called Rich Voss's Act. 
[01:13:30]  Just take on water as long as you can.  The sinking ship.  I'm down with the struggle.  Here's Rich Voss doing comedy in Sweden.  Look at the black girl checking me out.  That guy hasn't changed his act since the Yankees pitched Rudy May on three days rest.  I'm Rudy May, Joe.  Wow.  Right.  I want you guys to know I'm in Cleveland.  I got your back.  I'll be spreading the word.  Don't worry about it.  It's all good in Cleveland.  I got your back.  You got the best guy possible running recon for you. 
[01:14:00]  You don't even have to plug anything.  I just want you guys to know I'm here.  I'm a walking wow sticker, so please show us your best when we're walking through town.  And for crying out loud, listen to Opie and Anthony.  It's the greatest.  You'll never get let down.  It's the best.  Yeah, if you're a new fan of the radio show and you go see Jay, please,  please go and talk to Jay for us.  All right.  Yeah.  And then call the show and, you know, tell them I suck.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  I'm down with the struggle.  Those crackheads will sell anything.  I got a washing machine door just like I did in 1982. 
[01:14:30]  The crowd sings along with his act like dice, but not in a good way.  I'm still trying to get over the Rudy May joke.  Oh, Rudy May was my favorite.  Get out of your head.  Goddamn, Jay Moore.  All right, Jay.  All right.  There's a couple of security guys in the room.  I think you're going through Matt's bag for reefer.  They had to fix the bed first.  It was an unsmoking room, but we converted it.  All right.  Much respect on the Philly thing.  Those troopers are just looking for a party, man. 
[01:15:00]  I know you guys handle your stuff close to the vest.  They got nothing to worry about.  Yeah.  This ain't the mall at Short Hills, baby.  We're on the Turnpike, the big dragon.  Hold on.  Someone wants to bust on you about beyond the glory.  Sean.  Yes.  You're on with the great Jay Moore.  How are you, boys?  And Jay, I love you.  You're the greatest.  But, dude, you're killing me with that glory show.  It's a good show.  It's a great show.  But I watched the Mario Andretti episode the other day.  You were overpronouncing these Italian names like...  I was doing it in nice Italian sense. 
[01:15:30]  Chicken roll-a-team.  No, man.  No way, Manny.  I got to...  We got to agree to disagree, because I nailed that money.  Dude, you nailed it.  I'll tell you.  You nailed it.  It was out of me again.  You're doing that, though.  Mario Andretti.  It is funny, though, when you hear guys on TV, and then all of a sudden that word comes  up, whether it's Italian or Spanish, and they give the proper pronunciation.  Like Regan's joke.  You ever see that girl on the Channel 5 News?  She speaks perfect English the whole episode, and she's like, this is Lisa Sanchez, so thank 
[01:16:00]  you very much.  And I'm Cynthia Zandana.  Cynthia Zandana, that's right.  Cynthia Zandana.  All right, boys, you suck.  Take care.  I got to hear myself on the radio.  Thanks, Sean.  Sean, thank you.  Oh, by the way, in Cleveland, it's a good three and a half minute delay.  I'm just now listening to the stoner.  Oh, wow.  It's really a huge delay.  All right.  If I hang up and listen to myself, I don't even think I'm on yet.  No, you're not on yet.  Cleveland rocks, baby.  I'm here to prove it.  And you guys suck, and keep up the good work.  All right, check it out, Jay.  Shout out to a 20-year-old.  I'm looking for it. 
[01:16:30]  Thanks, Jay.  See you.  You're the man.  Jay Moore.  Let's go to Joe.  One of the guys in the caravan, obviously.  Heading down to Philadelphia, part of the WOW Summit.  Joe!  Yeah, we're out here.  We're getting just past exit nine right now.  We had a couple of state troopers go by us.  They just pulled over on the side and let us go.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're picking up people all along the way.  It's about, oh, 30, 40 bikes and, I don't know, 50 cars.  Wow.  It's going to be a party, man.  God, now I want to. 
[01:17:00]  I wish we could have gone.  Oh, ass.  It's all going to end at Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue in Philadelphia.  Doors open in about 15 minutes.  It's going to be a party.  These girls are wowing.  Cool.  These girls are wowing all over the place.  Right on, man.  I got a girl with me that's lost her shirt already.  Oh, really?  Oh, what a shame.  She ripped it right in half trying to wow a truck driver.  That's so cool.  All right.  We'll keep you guys in touch.  Oh, you guys are going to hit a few places in Philadelphia, right, before you get to it?  Yeah.  We're going to hit some places.  Get that map. 
[01:17:30]  I've got to find out where it is.  All right.  We'll get the map out and we'll let everyone know.  Yeah, we're going to hit some places.  We're in the car lane going down to Turnpike South.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  All right.  Take care, guys.  And Tommy, right next to the convoy.  Tommy.  Yo.  What's going on out there?  Turnpike, we just passed Exit 9.  I'm in the truck lanes off trying to catch up so I can switch over.  All right.  And what's the scene out there?  There's about, I don't know, 20, 30 bikes.  There are troopers I can unmark, but they're just trying to sneak a peek.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  They love it.  This is awesome.  You guys rule, man.  Are you taking the ride all the way to Philly with the gang?  Well, I'm trying.  I've got some customers waiting on me, but, you know, they'll be here when I get back.  Have some fun, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Tommy.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Show's moving a mile a minute now, man.  I know.  Because on the line, we've got one of our pals, Bubba Ray.  Bubba Ray.  Bubba Ray.  What's up?  What's up, man?  From the WWF.  How are you, sir?  How you doing, guys?  The scariest guy to ever be in our studio on the phone, Bubba Ray.  I hope I didn't scare you too much. 
[01:18:30]  No, we love you, man.  We want you to come in and, you know, help us out with this debauchery.  What happened?  This guy, Bubba Ray, first of all, is the real deal.  I mean, he comes in the studio, and I honestly believe you were going to kill one of our guests that were in here one day.  I honestly believe that you are right.  Yeah.  And like someone like Taz, very intimidating.  We've had him in here a lot.  And he gets people to the brink of peeing on themselves because they're just so scared of what they think Taz is going to do to them. 
[01:19:00]  I think they just defecate down their legs when they see Taz.  But Taz has said he will never lay a hand on somebody, especially first.  Well, you've got to be careful, especially in our line.  You lay a hand on somebody first, and they're diving deep into your bank account.  Yeah, but you're like a retard.  You'll just hit somebody.  I don't know whether to take that as a compliment or not.  I mean it in the best of ways, Bubba Ray.  And if you were here, I might have phrased it differently.  Hey, Bubba, that was Anthony that said that, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, and Anthony, if I was in the studio, this retard may have backhanded you. 
[01:19:30]  Now, maybe I would have phrased it differently if you were here, Bubba Ray.  Okay, I think you would have.  When are you going to come by and hang with us again?  You know what?  Every time we're supposed to do something with you guys, something goes wrong or backfires.  So they came up to me the other day.  They're like, you want to do O&A?  And I said, yeah, sure, no problem.  Cool.  But next time I'm in New York, I should definitely try to get by the studio.  It's a lot more fun in the studio.  Hell yeah.  You know?  We had Stephanie on the phone yesterday.  Oh, really?  We broke the news to everyone. 
[01:20:00]  It's all over the Internet today that she finally admitted those are breast implants.  They are?  Yeah.  Completely messed up.  Hey, implants are not.  They look pretty damn good to me.  They scare me, Bubba Ray.  They're huge.  Hey.  You know, I like them a little big, but they are like, they're monstrous.  I think she needed them.  She needed something.  Maybe not the quantity, but she needed something to lift them up a little bit.  I know it's the boss's daughter, Bubba Ray.  Whatever makes the boss happy. 
[01:20:30]  You think his daughter getting implants makes Vince happy?  I don't know.  Stephanie, I want you to get breast implants.  Yeah, I can't picture him saying that at a meeting.  Hey, you know what?  Any chick, you know, that wants to get them if they're not feeling confident about herself  or for whatever reason, you know?  She wanted them.  She got them.  It's over with.  They look damn good.  You know, we'll go from there.  She probably want to beat Pat Patterson to them.  Oh, man.  That was wrong.  I'm sorry, man.  That was wrong.  Sorry, dude.  I just had to fit that one in.  Hey, Bubba Ray, that was Scorch visiting the show today. 
[01:21:00]  Who's Scorch?  Scorch is from Syracuse.  He does a show up in Syracuse, and we used to work with him in Boston, so he's down visiting  today.  He calls this show the Kingdom of Naked Dish.  That's a good kingdom.  That's a good kingdom.  So you guys are like nationwide now, huh?  We're getting there.  I heard you say you're in Cleveland, you're in Philly.  Chicago, Dallas, Washington, Boston, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Columbus.  All right, all right, enough.  Stop putting yourself over.  That's a pretty good list. 
[01:21:30]  We love this guy, man.  You're spreading your debauchery all over the United States, huh?  Yeah, like a plague.  I've got to ask you a serious question about the WWF.  When are they going to thin the hurt and get rid of some of those wrestlers?  There's too many.  Well, there's a lot of guys out there right now, and there's only one major place to work.  You know, everybody is jockeying for position, trying to get a job.  I know there are a lot of guys, but there's a lot of quality guys.  You know, there are some guys that just don't get TV time, but they're excellent wrestlers,  and they're great personalities. 
[01:22:00]  And sometimes you just got to sit back and wait your turn.  You know, you got to be patient.  You know, not everybody gets to be on TV all the time.  There's not a bunch of stone colds or a bunch of rocks out there.  Right.  It's taking some time away from your mic time, my friend.  Hey, you know what?  I'm in a tag team, and tag teams aren't always in the focal point of things.  Because I know what, you know, the Dudleys know what their role is.  Anytime the WWF needs to, you know, call on us, you know, to tear down the house  and give them a good show, we're there. 
[01:22:30]  You always put on a good show.  You know, you can't expect to be, you know, in the focal point at all times.  It's not going to happen.  So you just got to sit back, wait, keep yourself, you know, in shape, keep yourself going.  And when they call for you, you tear the house down.  You know, why didn't Goldberg get involved with this whole thing?  I don't know.  Don't know?  I have no idea.  I hear it's contract crap.  Really?  Yeah, they're sitting out making a bloody fortune.  Well, you know what?  There's guys out there that wrestle for the money, and there's guys out there that wrestle, 
[01:23:00]  you know, because they're passionate about the business.  Right on.  You know, if that was me in that situation, I would probably, I don't know,  I would probably set my buyout and do what I love for the rest of my life, which is wrestle.  Right.  Yeah, there you go.  You know?  So who are you guys wrestling at SummerSlam?  We got a six-man match.  That little son of a bitch, Spike, he just won't stay out of our head.  He's like, horrible.  Spike is insane.  I mean, he's like my size.  What is he, like 150, 160? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, he's 150 pounds with a big load of crap right in his shorts.  Wow.  And completely insane takes on the big guys, too.  And he gets thrown around pretty good.  Yeah, he does.  He's like a little shot put.  Right.  So I think it's going to be Spike and the APA against the Dudleys in Test.  Cool.  So it'll be a good match, but that's not going to be, you know, any comparison to the three,  you know, big main events they got at SummerSlam, which should be, you know, phenomenal.  I don't know if you guys know about him.  You got Austin against Angle. 
[01:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know, who's going to break, you know, somebody's going to try and break each other's ankle on that one.  And then you got Rocky against Booker T.  Well, Rocky's got to win that.  Why does he have to?  Well, let's set up the Rocky Stone Cold thing.  We all know that.  He doesn't have to win.  Ah, yeah.  Come on.  Listen to you, you're giving it all away.  Don't let the people in Vegas hear you doing this.  Hey, Bubba Ray, I'll go out on a limb.  I'm going to say that someone goes through a table Sunday.  You know what?  Somebody should go through a table.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  You know what?  It's a better party when there's wood around.  Yes, there is.  You know?  So, and then you got Undertaker and Kane versus Canyon and DDP in the cage.  Right.  That should be an interesting ass-whooping.  Cool.  All right.  I think the whole show is going to be great, and everybody should tune in, definitely.  Well, we want you to come in here and hang with us.  Well, that sounds like a plan for next time.  It's not as interesting if you're not in the studio, right?  Well, yeah.  If you're in the studio, at least you get to beat people up, see naked women, you know?  Yeah.  It's always more interesting in the studio.  It's more like, you know, it's like being at the party and not just calling it up and 
[01:25:00]  hearing it on the other end.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bubba Ray, next time you come in, we're going to set up a real nice show just for you, my  friend.  I hope so.  Because we had Triple H in here.  He loves us now.  I heard all about that.  He was spanking girls left and right.  I heard all about that.  He made some girls' ass cheeks bleed.  I know her name.  Peaches.  Peaches.  This girl had a really, really hot ass.  She keeps going, yeah, yeah, Triple H spanked me.  He's like, okay.  I heard he hit her as hard as he could and she didn't even sell it. 
[01:25:30]  She didn't even put it over.  No, she did not.  He was hitting her at first and she's going harder, harder.  He takes that huge Triple H hand, you know, and just smacks her ass.  Broken blood vessels.  She had this red blood ass.  That's great.  Dark hand.  Dark hand print right on her butt.  Yeah.  That's the kind of girl you want to bring home to mom.  Now I'll make a fister.  Actually, that's the kind of girl you want to bring home to dad.  Yeah, sure.  Kind of sounds like the girl that is my mom.  Here, dad, take her outside, beat the crap out of her, and give her back to me when you're done. 
[01:26:00]  That sounds like my mom.  Sounds like your mom?  Sounds like my mom, man.  Well, hell, I'm on my first flight to Syracuse.  Hey, Bubba Ray.  Yo.  Thanks, man.  No problem.  You guys take care.  Come by and see us soon.  You got it.  All right.  Bye-bye.  SummerSlam Sunday on pay-per-view.  WWF.  It's going to be a good one.  He's great when he comes in here, though, man.  I swear to God.  All the other guys, very intimidating.  But even Taz, man, you think, this guy is going to hit somebody.  Yeah, last time Taz was in here, I was convinced he was going to hit Rick. 
[01:26:30]  Rick was, you know, peeing in his pants.  Oh, you're a tough guy?  You're a tough guy now?  And Rick would totally back down.  Back down like a little fairy Mary.  Swear to God.  And nothing against Rick.  I mean, it's Taz, you know.  But Bubba Ray, we had that guy in the studio.  I can't even remember the situation.  We're doing peppers and balls.  He said something to Bubba Ray.  Bubba Ray steps right up to him and goes, oh, yeah?  You want to go?  You know?  And the guy's like, what?  And Bubba Ray's just describing how he's going to dismantle this guy. 
[01:27:00]  It was all real.  And all Bubba Ray was waiting for was this guy to hit him first.  And then it's game on.  Do you know, the only time I ever got arrested was at a wrestling match.  And some kid squirted coke at me.  I was walking out to my car.  And some kid, because as you know, I work with WWF as well.  And so this kid squirted coke.  He's on the whole night.  He's like, ah, your mother's a lesbian, blah, blah, whatever.  So, you know, truth hurts sometimes.  I understand.  When I'm in the ring, you've got to deal with it.  I'm walking out to my car.  This guy's like, you big pussy, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I turn around and say, you know something? 
[01:27:30]  I can't really hit you.  And as soon as I said the word hit, he squirted up a coke.  And, like, shook up a coke and squirted it all over me.  And I smacked that little prick so hard.  Oh, man.  So I got arrested.  Cop, click, click.  I was in jail.  He's my one.  We've got to talk about you hanging out in a coffin, man.  We'll do that after the break.  Oh, God, the coffin seats.  After the break.  Do you remember that?  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, yeah.  John, what's up?  Hey, I'm driving on the turnpike.  Yeah.  Between exit 8A and 7, there's about a half a dozen overpasses.  They all have wow banners. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, cool.  And you guys have a lot of fans in Delaware, too.  Not just Philly.  All right.  Nice.  We appreciate that.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Cool, man.  Wow Summit making its way to Philadelphia.  They're still on the turnpike in a single-digit exit area.  We'll check in with them hopefully next.  All right.  If you're in the New York area, give us a call.  We've got some open lines.  877-692-1027.  Got to find the stoners.  I don't know what happened to them.  Oh, they just got back.  Oh, they just got back from where?  The stairwell.  Yeah, the magical stairwell. 
[01:28:30]  Rick, we'll talk to them next.  We'll talk to them next.  Also, Anthony, we haven't really spent a lot of time on our interview in FHM Magazine,  the one that has Anna Kornikova on the cover.  There's an interesting thing in here about our 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah.  And we got some audio clips from the 55-gallon drum challenge to play for the Nusit Tase.  Yeah, those are some great sick sounds that came out of it.  We might have to have a second annual.  Yeah, we could call it the Chandra Levy Challenge. 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  Or the Massachusetts Teen Internet Challenge.  Oh, what?  We have audio of hissing cockroaches and girls just losing their ass.  Yeah.  Do not change that dial.  1027 WNEW announces our new fall lineup.  Sports Guys Mornings.  Don and Mike, Middays.  Opie and Anthony, Afternoons.  Ron and Fez, Nights.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, we just had Bubba Ray on the line, 
[01:29:30]  and we're talking about WWF SummerSlam happening Sunday on pay-per-view.  And you know something, SmackDown, of course.  The show that revolutionized network television does a new look, a new set,  and it's live tomorrow night.  WWF SmackDown is live on UPN.  Anything can happen.  Anything goes.  And when Alliance leader Stone Cold Steve Austin rules with an iron fist,  anything will happen.  This past Monday, the Rattlesnake reaffirmed his role as leader of the Alliance  by calling out certain members that he felt were pathetic  in order to teach Alliance members about leadership and respect. 
[01:30:00]  He has called for the first ever Stone Cold Austin Invitational live on WWF SmackDown.  What does Stone Cold Steve Austin have in store?  Tune in tomorrow to find out.  The last SmackDown before SummerSlam live tomorrow night.  Tensions high between The Rock and Booker T,  who'll gain the advantage going into the biggest pay-per-view event of the summer.  Don't miss WWF SmackDown live tomorrow night, 8, only on UPN.  In New York City, you can watch SmackDown live on the 30-foot screen at WWF New York.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW New York.  This is the O&A Show.  It's wow.  It's Richemount Wednesday.  Thank you, ladies, for helping us out today.  We can't even get to your phone calls today because there's so much going on on the radio show.  People getting wowed for the first time in many different cities, Ant.  Yeah.  We got a wow going on. 
[01:31:00]  The 20-year-old is running around just showing her boobs to everybody.  We were just playing foosball.  Laura, right?  With the stoner guys.  Hold on one second, Ant.  We're doing the wow summit to Philadelphia.  There's a guy that's on his cell phone.  We've just got to get to him really fast here.  Ed, what's up?  God bless you freaking tools.  What's going on, man?  I just got off the turnpike.  I got wowed.  God bless you guys.  Cool.  You are the insanity of the airwaves.  Well, they're heading down to Philadelphia. 
[01:31:30]  And I just got off around Exit 8A, and they're south of that.  And Philadelphia, line up.  You're in for a treat.  How many people are in the convoy?  I'd say about 30, 35.  35 bikes?  About 15 to 20 bikes.  You got trucks.  I saw a van.  I don't know if it's your van.  It's got a huge wow banner on the back of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  They're going to end at Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue in Philadelphia.  Great deal, gentlemen.  Doors are opening over there. 
[01:32:00]  But they're going to hit a few places in Philadelphia itself, and hopefully we can tell the folks  where they're going to be, all right?  Excellent.  Thanks, Ed.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Opie, Tumor's checking in and saying, wow, I love Screech on Saved by the Bell.  His voice has changed so much.  No, it's Scorch who's joining us today from Syracuse, not Screech.  Didn't that guy email us?  We were in Boston last year, Tuesday, and the same exact thing.  Yeah, same joke.  But you know something?  Still funny.  It's still funny. 
[01:32:30]  Hey, Ben, grab that mic and just go over where the Wow Summit's going to hit really fast.  Those people are in their cars.  They don't have their computers on.  Once they get into Philly, they're going to the Liberty Bell, then to the Independence  Hall, Ben Franklin Parkway, Rittenhouse Square, South Street, Pat Stakes, and then at Maui  Entertainment Complex.  Cool.  There you go.  Right on.  Oh, here's Psycho Tim checking in.  Psycho Mark's brother.  Gah, gah, gah.  You're ripping me off at the psycho thing.  Timmy.  What's going on? 
[01:33:00]  Well, you tell us.  Kid, tons of wow signs, tons of wow signs.  But I think we overlooked something.  Huh?  You know when you're riding a bike at 70, 80 miles an hour, the sand hits in the face,  the cheeks are a little bit.  Yeah.  You have an exposed breast at that speed.  Uh-oh.  We don't want any bugs on the breasts when they get to Philly.  Yeah.  It's not that happens.  Those because of the sandbags, they might get knocked off the back of the bike and flips  up at the wrong time.  You know, and all of a sudden you go through those swarms of bees or ladybugs or whatever  you fly through and they just splat on the windshield. 
[01:33:30]  We don't need breasts with bugs stuck to them.  Yeah.  That's the only thing.  The sand and stuff.  It would probably hurt a little bit, but there's people on the bridges, the overpasses,  the signs.  The Department of Corrections in New Jersey, they pull up behind us.  I thought we were all getting pints.  And they just go by with a wow sign.  The big guy in the vehicle, eight of them in a van.  Cool.  Are you taking a break right now?  Yeah.  We pulled off someplace in, uh, in, uh, I don't know where the hell I am.  All right.  I'm from Boston.  I don't know where the hell I am. 
[01:34:00]  Really?  You got Boston representing today.  Representing Boston.  I got to let you go because Keith, the cop's on the line.  No, Keith, no, Keith's going to get on this phone.  Keith's going to get on this phone.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Carlos, what's going on?  This is Keith's brainchild right here, the wow summit to Philly.  Keith, what's going on?  What's going on?  You tell us.  One second.  Who knows what rest stop this is?  It's just somebody, isn't it?  A little confusion here.  Nobody knows where the hell we are.  We'll figure it out. 
[01:34:30]  Go on, man.  Ask the Molly Pitcher.  Hold on.  Would you like to speak to Patty?  Patty's got a big grin on her face.  My God, Patty.  Hey, Keith, Keith.  What's up?  How many people are following the summit?  Oh, let's see.  Hold on one second.  So far, we've got two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty-one  bikes.  We started with six.  And we've got about 14 or 15 cars.  I hope a lot of pictures are being taken.  Yeah, we've got a lot of pictures.  People taking pictures from the vehicles.  People on the bikes taking pictures. 
[01:35:00]  You see every overpass there's somebody with a wow sign.  That's so cool.  And I think the bike has turned Patty into a raving slut.  She's now giving oral favors in Sunoco bathrooms.  Just from that short trip.  Animal unleashed.  So we just passed exit seven on the turnpike.  Okay.  And we're trying to figure out.  I'm going to give YSP a call and see about how far away we are.  And we'll give you guys an update with that.  You guys are going to still go by the Liberty Bell and all that? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're just going to see what sort of time we're making.  Okay, cool.  Let's talk to Starker Patty real fast.  Hold on one second.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be great.  Hello?  Patty, how are you?  Great.  I'm having fun.  Patty.  Especially when he goes like 80 miles an hour.  That's so cool.  That's a lot of fun.  Now, Patty.  Patty, has the bike been vibrating underneath you?  What?  I can't hear because everyone's making so much noise.  What?  Patty, has the vibration of the motorcycle in that area made you feel funny? 
[01:36:00]  No, not at all.  I don't feel it at all.  But I do know that my hair is standing on the end of my arms.  I don't know why.  Under your arms?  Yeah, that must be why.  On my arms.  It's called the big O.  Have you had the big O yet?  No.  Because of the big animal that you're...  Are you supposed to get that?  Yeah, the Harleys are like a big beast between your legs.  Oh, really?  I didn't do that.  Sit on that hog.  Sit on that hog. 
[01:36:30]  You're not making cream cheese in your panties?  What?  Nothing.  No.  Sorry.  Someone's going to think there's a grease leak on the rear sprocket.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Patty, shut up.  Get back on your hog.  All right.  Okay.  That'll be fun.  Wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Stalker Patty.  You're welcome.  Let's talk to Keith real fast.  Stalker Patty finds her way back to her motorcycle by leaving a trail of saliva.  Much like the ants do to find the cricket. 
[01:37:00]  O.P.  Hey, Keith.  No, this is Tim.  Hey, Tim.  You guys want me on the phone now?  Because Ty just talked to us and slobbered and...  Yeah, I know.  ...off at the phone.  I can't find Keith, though.  I'm very excited.  There's a million people showing up here right now.  There's tons of cars.  All right, cool.  We'll get back on the highway, all right?  All right, cool.  Thank you.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  He's ripping me off.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  This thing's alive.  Looks like we've got a second.  Ah!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Stalker Patty leading the way.  Yeah.  There's a dark of the moon on the... 
[01:37:30]  Break-a, break-a.  ...the Kenworth pulling logs.  Cab over Pete with a reefer on.  We need a smoky report.  ...on I-10...  ...I'm smoking from my crotch.  ...I says, Big Ben, this here's a rubber duck, and I'm about to put the hammer down.  She has got to be feeling it.  There it is, the convoy.  Yeah, there she is.  Convoy.  A beautiful sight.  God, they used to actually play that.  I still do. 
[01:38:00]  That would hit...  Is that the big song up there in Syracuse?  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Hey, I'm down here at the exit where I rest there where everyone's at, and there is a ton of people down here.  I mean, people are just pulling off the turnpike and parking their cars anywhere.  Yeah, we didn't expect it to be this big today.  Oh, by the time they get to Philly, this is going to be ridiculous.  There is girls with the biggest boobs just hanging out.  This is friggin' awesome.  You guys are done.  Yeah.  Well, that's... 
[01:38:30]  I got my wild sticker, so I'm going to get wild before I have to go home.  All right, it's our little present to you guys today.  One city at a time, Opie.  One city at a time.  We give gifts.  See?  We got plans for every city.  Oh, yeah.  Cleveland, I think, is next.  Wait till DC BJ.  Just wait.  Gifts.  Hey, how are the stoners doing?  All right.  Charlie says, always bring a towel.  Wasn't that fun playing foosball? 
[01:39:00]  I mean, I'm getting so into that game now.  Anthony's an unstoppable force on offense.  He's got the two front battles.  Oh, it's slap shots.  It's...  He's got plays and stuff, right?  Whoa.  He's messed up.  I'm playing goalie.  I couldn't stop him.  It was...  Now, they were threatening to have the lovely girl...  What's...  I'm sorry.  Laura.  Laura.  Is that a fake name?  No.  The lovely Laura take her shirt off and play defense topless, which might have changed 
[01:39:30]  the game a little bit.  It might have...  It might have helped the game a lot.  Yeah.  It would have helped the game.  I don't know if it would have stopped the scoring, but no one would have cared if they  were scored on if you were playing topless.  Fantastic.  Oh, there she goes.  There she goes.  Nice score, Trey.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  They don't have them in Syracuse.  I keep saying that.  We need to bring you to the kingdom of nakedness right here.  I need to import you upstate, man.  Play some totally nude foosball.  We've taken lots of pictures of Laura and everyone else, but unfortunately, the system's 
[01:40:00]  down.  We can't upload anything.  Yeah.  We're having such a hard time with instant feedback and the NAW site and all the other  sites.  It's just a pain in the ass trying to get feedback here on the computer.  Later today, we'll have lots of pictures for you guys on opieandanthony.com, all right?  Look, where are the 20-year-old boobies?  I'm barely getting any feedback, but it's all about the boobies.  We'll get them up soon enough.  Dominic, what's going on? 
[01:40:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Syracuse.  Hey, Scorch.  Major fan.  Hey, Dominic.  Hey.  Major fan of yours, too, man.  O&A.  Scorch was syndicated before y'all.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's got two stations up there, Oswego and Syracuse.  Whoa.  Rock.  Yo, this show rocks a breast, and we got Scorch, and we got O&A.  That rocks.  All right, man.  That really rocks.  Thank you.  There you go.  I'm Scorch fan from Syracuse.  There you go. 
[01:41:00]  Totally new.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I was just up right before the Edison rest stop, which is way behind the wild caravan.  Some guy just totally...  Exaggerated.  More exaggeration.  Someone trying to mess up our party.  It ain't raining on our parade.  Douche.  Ed, what's up?  Ed, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  The caravan, they're at the rest stop just north of us, I guess.  Okay.  Yeah, they should be coming. 
[01:41:30]  They were just past exit 7A, right?  Yeah.  So, yeah, they'll be down here in about, like, less than five minutes, it should be.  Oh, you're on the overpass?  Yeah, I'm on my cell phone.  We're on the overpass, and we got my friend Jen with us, who's wowing anybody who haunts going by.  This is an amazing day for wow.  It's a great wow day, and this is what wow's all about, people.  It's a classic.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, Ed.  All right, you're welcome.  Cool.  Getting out there and making people's ride, wherever they are, a little more fun with beautiful breasts, yes. 
[01:42:00]  We should talk about the huge crowd at Bar Ready?  Yes.  Oh, really?  Huge crowd at Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue in Philadelphia.  I'm so pissed we can't be there.  I guess we have a few people that like the show in Philadelphia.  Nice.  Nice to see.  Anthony, we're in the latest issue of FHM Magazine.  We haven't really talked about this article yet.  No.  It's with Anna Kornikova on the cover, and we're doing a magazine signing party tomorrow. 
[01:42:30]  Just another excuse for us to hang and drink beers.  Yeah, at least this way.  We can be there.  We're in three magazines that are on the newsstands right now.  Rolling Stone, FHM, and New York Magazine.  Yeah.  And we've been in Time lately, recently.  I'm not acknowledging the Time article anymore.  Will you be signing copies of Time tomorrow night?  No.  To tell you the truth, don't bring your Time, because I will not sign it.  I will not sign Time Magazine. 
[01:43:00]  We sit with that tool for an hour and a half, doing an interview, and the only quote he has  from me is an off-the-cuff remark I made in our office after the interview, after the  show, after everything.  I don't think you told Scorch what happened.  What happened?  Early nude Mary-Kate.  Dick.  Oh, I heard something about this.  Yeah.  Yeah, so the guy, you know, I'm answering all his inane, stupid, monotonous questions,  and what does he print?  He prints when we were in the office, he walks in, and I point to the famous now, the famous 
[01:43:30]  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen poster, one of the more recent ones that are out, where they  are looking hot.  These girls are 15 now, and you can tell that by the time they're 18, these girls are going  to be so effable, it's going to be ridiculous.  And the whole fantasy of twins like that, whoo, just sends shivers down me spying.  And to put it in perspective, the lovely Laura that's in the studio with that unbelievable  boobs.  Take a show with these.  Oh, there they go.  I want to call her boobs Mary-Kate and Ashley.  There you go. 
[01:44:00]  Laura?  Yes.  A mere four, four and a half years older than the old situation.  When did you start developing those lovely cans?  At about four.  No way.  I'm just kidding.  Eleven.  Seventeen.  Seventeen.  Come on.  Yes.  Seventeen.  Here, I'll just let you look at them.  Seventeen.  So they are spanking new.  They are.  Look at that.  Wow.  All right.  The left one's a little bigger.  All right.  Well, on a lot of girls, the left one is bigger.  I don't get that.  Someone should explain that to us. 
[01:44:30]  From the days of archery.  You should explain that to us.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm babbling.  Remember that for what did we learn on the O&A show today?  From the days of archery.  Right.  Yeah.  So I say, look at that.  Look how hot they're getting.  And then I said, Mary Kate's the priss and Ashley's the goer.  You can tell by the poster.  And that's my quote.  And Time effing magazine.  I can understand.  I don't care.  When we did the interview with Penthouse, fine.  Print anything.  Print, you know, whatever horrid thing that I said. 
[01:45:00]  But Time magazine was supposed to be that respectable article that I would maybe, if I was sitting  in the dentist's office, two years from now, I'd be like, oh, there's our Time magazine article.  Right next to the Highlights magazine.  Highlights.  Highlights.  Painless.  You know, something that my mother or other family members could leave out on the table.  And, oh, yeah, by the way, my son's quote is in here.  Now?  Who the hell?  Who wants to acknowledge that?  I think it's still a great quote myself. 
[01:45:30]  I think it's hilarious.  Look, I'm not denying the quote.  Believe me, and I'm not taking it back.  They are damn hot.  And I still believe Ashley is the goer and Mary Kate's the press.  I'm not saying it's not an accurate quote.  So, to bring this all the way around, you will not be signing copies of Time magazine tomorrow night.  No.  Right after the show.  We haven't partied in Manhattan in a while.  Right after the show, we're going to be at Hooters downstairs, 56th Street between Broadway and 7th.  Fox is coming down with the cameras.  Fox!  To film some stuff for the Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:46:00]  For Bill O'Reilly.  His little documentary he's doing on us and other people.  Here are your fans.  They're disgusting people.  Yeah, Bill.  Great.  So, we're hoping a big crowd shows up right after the show tomorrow at Hooters downstairs, okay?  And John has a question on line four, and it's, will Ant sign my Olsen Twins CD?  I will sign all Olsen Twins memorabilia.  Yes.  In lieu of signing Time magazine, I will sign any Olsen Twins merchandise. 
[01:46:30]  And hopefully a bunch of the folks you know and love from this radio show will be there partying as well tomorrow night.  Maybe even Earl.  Do you think Earl can make the trip?  I may fly back down, man.  I may fly back down, man.  Oh, Scorch, you ought to show up.  I may come back down.  You ought to show up.  Laura's going to be there with her lovely boobs.  Nah, I'm coming back down.  Hey, Laura, will you be my date?  I will, Scorch.  If you'll be my date.  Stoner dudes?  Scorch, do you want to go together?  I need a date.  If you're my date, I'm coming back here tomorrow night.  All right, I'm going to be your date.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  You know what he starts to date?  Totally nude.  They end up totally nude and beaten on the side of a road. 
[01:47:00]  And then I bring them back to Syracuse to be part of the kingdom of nakedness.  Kingdom of nakedness, where they never leave.  I handcuff them to the radio board.  Will Earl actually leave the studio, walk the 20 feet to Hooters and look like he can't  be bothered?  Earl, will you be joining us tomorrow for the magazine signing right next door here in  Midtown Manhattan?  Hell no.  Why not?  Earl, why not?  Good question.  They'll be there. 
[01:47:30]  Why won't you do?  You know something?  Everyone from the show is going to be there.  We're all going to be hanging with the fans and everything.  Yeah.  The listeners of this show.  And you, people are going to be asking, where's Earl?  And you're not going to be there for what reason?  Do you have anything else to do?  No.  So why not show up?  Laura, show Earl your boobs.  Yeah, look at these, Earl.  What do you think, Earl?  This is why I should take his job.  Because he doesn't want to do anything.  Oh, Earl.  Oh, my God.  Even those boobs aren't going to make you smile.  She's like, I want to do those. 
[01:48:00]  I think Earl's having a nervous breakdown.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Earl.  Earl.  What do you think of those boobs?  Sid, nice.  Nice.  They're more than nice.  I said it like, I said it Jim Norton.  Nice.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Keith wants to check in.  Keith, the cop.  Keith.  Keith.  We lose him.  All right.  He's back on the road with the Wow Summit to Philadelphia.  Earl, you have to show up tomorrow.  It's part of, now it's part of the job.  You have to show up tomorrow.  There's people going to say, where's Earl? 
[01:48:30]  Where's Earl?  I'm working on the public file.  Earl?  The public file?  Does the public file need more?  No.  Public filing?  Yes, Ben?  There's a, I think there's a salesperson involved in tomorrow night's festivities.  Would that be Matt Devote?  Yes.  Earl was in a screaming match with at about 10 o'clock this morning.  A battle royal going on here in the office between Earl and Matt Devote today.  A yelling match, right?  Oh, Rick and I listened to the whole thing.  It was beyond hilarious. 
[01:49:00]  What was your argument, Earl, with Matt?  What was the problem?  We just had a problem with a promotion that went horribly awry.  Would that be the Asbury Park promotion?  Part of it, yes.  That's part of it.  Would it be that Matt somehow caused you to be late?  No.  Actually, we had a problem with Friday's promotion.  Friday's.  Friday's.  That happened on the end.  That happened.  I don't want to get into it.  You're being cryptic.  Cryptic Earl.  No, I just don't want to get into it.  The new Darth Vader. 
[01:49:30]  It's something to do with Friday.  I can't be more specific.  There's a ship in our field.  It's the Millennium Something.  Send the stormtroopers.  I'm not telling you exactly where.  It's not important.  I am Darth Vader.  Being vague.  Point the ship somewhere over there. 
[01:50:00]  I can't be too specific.  We had a problem with promotions with Matt Devote.  What was the problem, Darth Vader?  It was a problem with Friday.  Friday.  Wow.  Friday was a lot of stuff going on Friday.  I know.  And you don't need to know any more.  Earl.  What do you want in this Death Star?  Anthony, Earl is ripping off Gary Wall.  Who, who, who? 
[01:50:30]  Gary Wall was Darth Vader for a while.  Now Earl is Darth Vader.  It has to do with something or the other that happened with the thingamajig.  Earl, let's get it out on the air.  What was the problem?  What was the problem?  We had a problem with the grand prize winner.  The grand prize winner of?  WWF.  WWF.  He didn't want to go, that's all.  Yeah.  So we defaulted to place number two, right?  Holy, that was the major problem.  We had, uh, for... 
[01:51:00]  It was a problem of galactic import.  We had the SummerSlam safari on Friday.  We got a guy that came in with the Siberian Tiger.  He won the trip to SummerSlam in, I think, San Jose for Sunday on pay-per-view.  He didn't want to go.  He just wanted to help the show out.  So we gave it to the guy with the 12-foot snake.  What's the problem?  I can't be specific.  It just turned into a three-day cluster app.  Matt Devotee, leave him to me.  Hold, all right, Earl. 
[01:51:30]  Earl.  The vagueness is strong in this one.  Right.  Why did it turn out to be a three-day cluster app?  One guy didn't want...  You tell me.  I don't know.  I'm still trying to figure it out.  One guy didn't want to go, so you give it up to the...  You give the prize to the model.  I wish it were that simple, but they make...  That's...  I don't want to go into it.  Matt Devotee, I am your father.  And he wears all black, just like Darth Vader.  Earl, it is that simple.  Tell me something I don't already know.  But you said it took three days to tell one guy that he was going. 
[01:52:00]  No, it took three days of phone calls back and forth to figure it all out.  Where is the rebel base?  And don't be vague like me.  Earl, there's nothing to figure out.  It's like, oh, um...  Goodbye, gentlemen.  Oh, he's leaving.  There he goes.  I've already given away too much information.  What's there to figure out?  The guy who won the prize didn't want to go.  So you call up the runner-up and go, hey, dude, guess what?  Good news for you.  You're going.  You're going.  Cool.  It was a three-day cluster F.  Three-day cluster F. 
[01:52:30]  Cluster F.  They got yelling so loud at each other, because, like, Rick's editing.  I've got a CD blare, and the TV's on, and it was louder than all that.  Just screaming, yelling, with Earl going, go F yourself, Matt.  Oh, yeah.  They were yelling.  Matt's throwing stuff.  He's throwing his hands in the air, like, girl, why don't you just give me an answer?  He's like, go F yourself, Matt.  Go F yourself.  Earl's new catchphrase.  Wow.  Wow.  They almost came to blows.  Wow.  That's the bigger.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  What's up, guys? 
[01:53:00]  Earl's not going to Rooters.  It's a bunch of women there with big breasts.  He wouldn't have nothing to do with that.  What are you kidding me?  Maybe if you go to Blue Boy County.  Don't you faggot.  Thank you, Doug.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  That's funny.  Click.  Dave, he just says, Earl's Darth Vader, and his nemesis is Obi-Wan devotee.  I will get you, Obi-Wan devotee.  Hey, Dave, good line, man.  Obi-Wan devotee.  He just stole that line from me.  That's all I was going to say.  Well, I read it, and I gave you credit. 
[01:53:30]  Darth Vader's mortal enemy.  Stinky rule.  All right.  Stinky does indeed rule.  And there are now Stinky Rules t-shirts on foundrymusic.com.  Stinky is getting too much power.  All right, we've got to move on.  I don't know what's up with Earl.  Something's wrong with Earl.  No one will ever know what's up with Earl.  People want to know if Earl comes, will he be signing copies of Shriek or Shrek?  Earl wants to meet Scorch? 
[01:54:00]  He did, yeah.  All right, well, bring him back.  We'll be called Earl.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, Owen, hey, man.  Hey.  They just, the WOW Summit just went south of Exit 7.  It is pandemonium down here, man.  Well, they pulled out of the rest stop, and traffic almost came to a standstill.  There's people on every overpass.  There's people standing on the side of the road.  It is amazing.  There's got to be, no lie, 50 cars following these motorcycles.  You have huge WOW banners, banners on trucks, WOW signs, homemade ones, stickers, everything.  And there's a huge crowd at the Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue in Philly already, too. 
[01:54:30]  Are they really?  Yeah.  I'm telling you, man, this is, traffic is messed up.  It's amazing, guys.  Let me have a Red Bull energy drink car in the convoy, too, it looks like.  Oh, my, probably the sales horse.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah.  You want good product placement?  Follow the website.  It's Philadelphia.  It's Obi-Wan devotee.  All right, thanks.  He's responsible for this Obi-Wan devotee. 
[01:55:00]  Earl.  Earl's going to be signing copies of Shrek tomorrow.  All right.  People want to know about the coffin with Scorch, though.  Scorch, huge WWF fan, works with the WWF when they do the local shows and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, like Triple H and the gang?  Yeah.  Thanks, Pac.  And you knew China for a little while, right?  Yeah.  And when we were all working in Boston.  100% natural China, by the way. 
[01:55:30]  She likes to be referred to as that.  Opie, we never technically worked in Boston.  We worked in Worcester.  Worcester, man.  No, Southboro.  We worked in Southboro.  Westboro.  Westboro.  Westboro.  Yeah, and when we were working there,  we got the offer to do a little promotion with WWF at the Worcester Centrum.  I was at the Worcester Centrum.  Yeah.  And we had just gotten to the station and to the market,  and we were really, like now we just go, go F yourself, man. 
[01:56:00]  You know, you just tell the people that approach you with these promotions,  get out of here.  What are you, insane?  But they said, look, you're going to be front row at this WWF event.  It wasn't even a TV event.  It was one of the road shows.  A house show.  You got all this.  A house show.  A house show.  Yeah, a house show.  We have to go over all the terms that the WWF uses because they're hilarious.  Like bomb scare?  My favorite is, yeah, bomb scare.  Oh, my God, what's the night look like?  Oh, it's bomb scare. 
[01:56:30]  That's when they walk out and no one's in the crowd.  They call it a bomb scare.  Sorry.  We get the, somebody approaches us at the station we're at and just goes,  hey, we got these front row seats for you, but this is great.  And they're selling it like, this is great, guys.  You know what you're going to be sitting in?  Guys, how great is this?  We're like, what, what?  You guys are sitting in the coffin seats.  Like, well, this is when the Undertaker was doing his whole dead man thing.  You guys, get this, you guys, no one else, you guys are in the coffin seats. 
[01:57:00]  Like coffin seats.  What the hell is that?  It's front row.  They're called coffin seats.  I'm like, okay, what I'm picturing in my head is they take a coffin.  They knock one of the sides out.  So now it is a bench.  It's a bench with a back on it and two short sides.  You're sitting in the coffin, which is now just called a bench.  A pew.  It's called a pew.  It's a pew, right, looking like a pew.  Yes.  A coffin, knock one side out, bench or pew.  Pew.  So I'm like, all right, I could do this.  I don't care.  This is fine. 
[01:57:30]  It's an event.  We're new here.  We get to this event.  Now, the place is packed.  Anyone familiar up there in Massachusetts with the Worcester Centrum, it was the porous ventilated  place, full of smoke.  It smelled like sweaty sack.  It was just awful.  Awful.  And this person that approached us with this whole idea is just like, follow me.  I'll take you to the coffin seats.  Talking up these coffin seats.  We go down. 
[01:58:00]  Now we're just about ringside, walking around looking for our seats.  I'm looking for the bench.  No.  No, it's the bench.  Up on a, not even just laying on the floor.  No.  Up on an elevated platform are two coffins.  With our names on it.  With our names on it.  So basically the whole crowd could go, who are the dicks in the coffins?  Slightly tipped up at the head.  Yeah.  So you could see the ring a little bit.  And we are supposed to now crawl in and lay in these coffins and watch the match from 
[01:58:30]  the coffin.  Seats.  Which was not seats.  They were just coffins.  They were coffins.  Yeah.  And then they weren't even tilted up.  To tell you the truth, they weren't even tilted up.  They were facing to the ceiling.  So you got to lay into seeing like a true dead person.  Well, you know something?  I thought at least they propped some pillows in there like they do with the wakes.  So, oh, look.  Hey, the dead relative's sitting up a little bit.  No, they propped the pillows under.  I'm pretty sure that's why I got canned, too, because I destroyed my coffin.  Yeah, I remember this.  As soon as I walked in there, my coffin was destroyed. 
[01:59:00]  No, well, you know what?  It wasn't your coffin.  Your coffin was our coffin.  It was our coffin, my friend.  So now I'm sitting there.  We passed on the coffin seats, my friend.  Here's how passionate I was about not going into these coffins seats.  Now, Opie had been in radio for quite a while, and you had done some stuff that you had to  do.  Stupid crap.  Now, during the beginning of your career.  Stupid crap.  So, even though this was really ridiculously stupid, you weren't very surprised with it.  Oh, no.  Yeah, because you'd been through the mill.  Oh, no.  I'm brand new to radio.  Brand new to the business.  And I'm walking up now. 
[01:59:30]  I'm very scared that I'm going to do something, and two seconds later, I'm going to be fired,  and I'm going to be back knocking tin and installing ductwork.  So, I didn't want to shake the boat.  This is how paranoid I was.  But with this, I was like, Opie, I'm not getting in that coffin.  He's like, no, huh?  And you go, no.  And Opie goes, I really don't want to get in this either.  I go, good, because we're not getting in this coffin.  So, he told Jim.  Crazy Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Told him, look, we're not getting in the coffin.  What was the guy's name with the fake hair, too?  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  The sales guy.  Oh, the guy that had the spray-on hair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  Spray on hair.  Remember you, Sam, Sam.  Sam with the spray on hair.  Sam with the spray on hair.  And when it used to rain or he sweat, it would be like mascara running down his head.  It was wonderful.  And now, the people that put this event together were pissed off that we weren't going to be in the coffin seats.  Because Crazy Jim was just like, hey, guys, I don't care.  Right.  Go ahead.  Don't go in the coffin seats.  So, we find Scorch at the event.  Scorch, look, you've got to do us a favor.  You've got to get in these coffin seats.  And I thought it was going to be a chore.  Didn't even have to twist his arm. 
[02:00:30]  Dude, what are you kidding?  I'm in.  Thank you.  You're right up front.  Like we were doing you a favor.  It's like, what do I owe you?  Nothing.  Just sit in them.  Because they said Opie and Anthony on them, I figured perhaps I'd finally get lucky.  So, we work our way way to the back now where we are sitting in some part of ventilation somewhere.  And we look down and there's Scorch laying in the coffin.  Having the time of his life.  Just enjoying life. 
[02:01:00]  Enjoying the ceiling of the Worcester Center and saying, nice ceiling.  You're just laying.  Like people are crowded in their seats.  And you've got all the room in the world in your coffin.  And then what happened now?  You decided to destroy the coffin.  Yeah, I was just trying to get comfortable.  I rolled over once.  Coffin was toast, man.  I think they gave me a cheap coffin.  They gave me a used coffin.  I think they dug that coffin up.  Pulled someone out of it that was already dead.  And that's it.  We'll put you guys in there.  Classic.  It's only WAF.  I got it.  I'm sorry. 
[02:01:30]  Cheap.  Screw it.  Sorry, guys.  If you listen to AF, you're not cool.  Hey, shut up.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Good news.  The system's back up and running.  Go to opieandanthony.com.  You get to see Laura's 20-year-old boobs.  Oh, I love them.  They are unbelievable.  Punch that up, won't you?  Look at how the boobs are coming in there, Laura.  Those bad boys.  We love you, Laura.  Oh, yeah.  That's my date.  That's my date tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Would you guys fly me back to town so I can come to this party?  Ken, what's going on? 
[02:02:00]  Hey, I've just got off base at 5 and they left the convoy.  Yeah.  Who is the chick in the white explorer?  We didn't even have one.  We have no clue.  We didn't have one of those.  That's okay.  Big wow on the back.  The chick is gorgeous.  Is she wowing everyone?  She wowed me.  I was in the maroon dent lizard truck.  Cool.  How many people are following the wow song?  It's pandemonium.  Cool.  Everybody's trying to get a good seat.  Right on.  All right.  Thank you, Ken.  You guys are great.  You know what?  Now I can listen to myself twice because I hit the New York, then the Pennsylvania button. 
[02:02:30]  Awesome.  Yes, Anthony?  Heather on line four.  Yeah, I know.  We have to take a break, but let's go to Heather real fast.  Heather, very pissed off.  Yeah.  Hi.  How are you doing?  What's wrong?  Well, here's the thing.  Last night, me and my boyfriend were in my room and he was telling me that my behind is  kind of pale and that I never see any sun.  So I had this self-tanning lotion.  Yeah.  So he agreed to rub it on my butt and, you know, bring out some color. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  So while I'm lying there, he's right, you know, whatever, putting it on my butt.  I wake up this morning and my ass says pork on it.  I am so pissed.  So I decided I'm not going to be pissed, but I just want to get revenge.  So I thought that you guys might have some ideas for me.  That's fine.  You know, they might have dumped out because there was a weird line in there.  So just in case, say it again, Heather.  From the beginning?  No, just the part.  He was putting the self-tanning lotion on your butt. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  So he puts the self-tanning lotion on my butt and he writes the word pork on my butt.  And I wake up this morning and see pork written on my butt.  It takes two or three hours for the stuff to go to show up.  What was he just like massaging your butt cheek at first, making you think he was rubbing  the lotion?  Yeah.  And then he just smeared the word pork on there.  And now you have...  And now I have pork.  And it won't come off because...  Pork!  ...scroved off self-tanning lotion.  It's there for like a week or two.  You got a fat ass, Heather? 
[02:04:00]  No.  I wish you could...  Take a picture of that.  I wish you said pork and beans.  Yeah.  I spark beans.  I think I'm going to take a picture, but that would only encourage him.  Thank you, Heather.  Do you have some advice?  I guess some revenge.  When you're giving him a hummer, bite it.  Good advice.  The ultimate revenge.  You'd love that one.  I'll tell him you guys said so.  All right, Heather.  After you do it.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  He was creative.  He put P-O on one half and R-K on the other cheek.  That's cool.  You don't need the O.  You can just put P on one cheek and then R-K.  The O takes care of itself. 
[02:04:30]  The brown O.  Tim, what's going on?  Tim.  Hello?  Oh, I'll be with top man.  Hello?  All right.  Tim.  He's gone.  Let me try it again.  Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Now we'll go, my name's Jim.  All right, whatever.  They call me Slim.  We should take a break.  Slim Jim.  We still haven't played the audio of the hissing cockroaches.  Yeah.  Want to hear that?  On the 55-gallon drum challenge that made the interview in FHM magazine.  We'll try to do that next, Anthony.  Can I say thanks to everybody before I get out of here, though? 
[02:05:00]  Because...  Are you leaving us?  Well, I've got to take off because I've got to go back because I've got to drop some  people off so I can fly back down tomorrow for this party with Laura.  There you go.  But I want to thank all your listeners for emailing at scorchscrch420 at aol.com and scorch  s-c-o-r-c-h at krock.com because you're very cool.  I get good response from coming on the show.  Yeah.  We've known you for about seven years.  Imagine that.  I'm amazed you could still talk with that voice.  You could still dig the scorch.  I thought your voice had two years in it top when you first met you.  Believe it or not, they said by the time I'm 40, inaudible to humans. 
[02:05:30]  Inaudible to humans.  You're like one of those engines on an old Buick, you know?  It's ticking, it's banging and stuff, but it never really dies.  That's me.  That's your voice.  Of course, you might have to stick around because one of our faves just arrived.  Otto and George.  Okay, I'll show you.  You have not seen anything like Otto and George.  Eric, what's up?  Yo, O&A.  What's up?  This is unbelievable, dude.  There's bikes everywhere.  We're flying down the tarpike.  Cars, trucks, everything, man.  It's just like, try to keep up with these guys. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Forget it.  They're trying to make the deadline, whatever you guys got going here.  We're trying to get to Philly.  It's incredible.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  The girls are flashing and their teeth are just flopping in the breeze, man.  Yeah, boobs everywhere.  I hope people are taking pictures and sending them into the show.  Flopping in the breeze.  Thanks, Eric.  Nice.  Those are nice breasts, flopping in the breeze.  Tim.  That's beautiful.  Hey, Tim.  Yeah.  What's up?  You guys suck.  I want to teabag you faggots.  But other than that, y'all keep up the good work, fellas.  Thanks. 
[02:06:30]  Teabag?  Okay.  Yeah.  We got to get Otto and George into the party next.  Oh, yeah.  You stoner dudes are going to have fun with Otto and George.  Oh, I think you're going to freak out.  You'll be all freaked, all right?  You guys want to go get high?  Get the puppet high.  My head is like, what?  And hissing cockroaches.  Oh, cool.

[02:08:30]  How did Gabe Marco get in that song?  Hey!  We're back with the O&A show.  I've got to go to Sue really fast.  Sue, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  Who is this?  Opie and Anthony.  It is not.  Hi.  It is not.  It is not.  It is not.  Oh, my God.  You're going to have a heart attack.  Okay, hold on.  This is going to be funny for everyone else.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right, hold on.  This is going to be funny for everyone except for the people of Boston.  All right, I wonder how the heck can you be back?  Stinky writes on the screen, Sue's calling in. 
[02:09:00]  She seems retarded.  No, that was what he wrote under your phone call.  It says, Sue, seems retarded.  No, it's just the Boston accent.  Can I hold on?  All right, I'll hold on.  I will hold on.  Stinky is now in the room.  All right, I'm going to hold on, but you better come back.  See what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  No, because I'm going to, I will.  Are you drunk?  I won't come back.  I will, and I'm telling you to talk to you. 
[02:09:30]  All right, Sue, are you under an assumed name, and did I used to be related to you?  No, I don't know.  I don't know, but.  Sue, are you drinking a box of wine?  Are you drinking a box of wine?  Are you a refrigerator?  And let me tell you something.  When you drive, do you say that three rights make a left?  What?  Because that's what I used to say, three rights make a left, give me my box of wine, my grandma  yay, and now it's eight o'clock, it's late, and I want to go home. 
[02:10:00]  So, Sue.  Sue.  What?  What do you have?  What in the world was that?  Sue.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, maybe she is retarded.  No, no, no.  Yeah, there's something wrong with Sue.  I just think.  Say what you got to say.  We got to move on with the show, Sue.  All right, you got to.  All right.  That's wonderful.  You are retarded.  I'm going to tell you something right now.  Yes, sir.  You guys are tremendous.  Tremendous.  Okay.  You are tremendous.  All right.  And you are retarded.  I just have to say that.  And just, I did it. 
[02:10:30]  I feel good.  Go, Sue.  All right.  All right.  Say hi to Bernie and Phil for us.  Stop.  All right.  No, you guys are wonderful.  A little humor for Boston.  No, you are.  Bernie and Phil.  You're wonderful, you're wonderful, you're wonderful.  Keep it up.  All right, Sue.  All right.  I enjoy the show.  All right.  Get a duddy deal at Duddy 4.  Thank you.  All right, Sue.  Thank you.  All right, Sue.  Sue.  Sue seemed a little retarded.  Well, you know.  I have to apologize to Stinky.  Yeah, that's a retarded lady right there. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  In the studio, Otto and George.  Yes.  Otto and George.  It's it.  I got patchouli oil.  Oh, yeah?  Isn't that what you used to cover up pot smells?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The head shops, they sell the patchouli.  Otto, you playing Caroline's tonight?  Caroline's tonight, 10 o'clock.  Very expensive.  If you're in the area, man, come on.  Very expensive.  Stay home.  It's not worth it.  It's very steep to go there.  Will that be a dirty show?  It's the nasty show. 
[02:11:30]  The nasty show, yeah.  Who else is on that bill?  Norton and whoever else is available.  You know what I mean?  Very cool.  Yeah, we got into town a little early, me and Joe and Mitch.  Yeah, we went to see Planet of the Apes.  We stopped by Bill Clinton's office up in Harlem.  He's hanging out with the nigs now.  We all know about that.  Oh, my God.  George, you are probably the most politically incorrect.  How are you going to do it?  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Jump the turnstile.  Shoot at the cops. 
[02:12:00]  Hold on, man.  Hold on.  George, the language a little bit.  You know, where we try.  You can't get tucked out in the first eight seconds, George.  Yeah, three times.  Yeah, you want people to hear what George is saying here.  Oh, we ran into Norton at this gas station, and he's such a night person.  It's just, when you see him during the day, he's like one of those worms when you pull  a rock out of the wet earth, and it, like, scurries for the darkness.  He's all twitching in the daylight like Dracula's sister.  He is not a day person. 
[02:12:30]  No.  Not at all.  Perverted little bug pulled out from under a rock.  Stoner Sean, what do you think of Otto?  In a nice way.  And the puppet George there.  The puppet reminds me a lot of my dad, and he's all messed up and just talking bad about  the back.  Thanks, dude.  Good luck in prison.  All right.  You can see him no more.  FCC.  Have a filet of fish in a box of yodel, sweetheart.  All right.  You had a tough pound of that.  Audrey Hepburn looking.  Hey, George, you want to see young Laura's boobs? 
[02:13:00]  She's 20 years old.  I can already see them.  This is my job for the day.  Look at this.  Nice.  Wow.  Yeah.  Aren't those nice?  Wow.  That's why we call it Wow.  That was kind of quick, though.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  She can keep around.  Give us something to focus on.  Yeah.  Leave him out.  My fly don't work that fast.  It's getting boring.  Not for the guys.  It's boring.  It gets boring.  Just take it off.  Yeah.  That's nice, right?  Hold on.  She's stopping the show. 
[02:13:30]  Hold on.  We've got to check in with the Wow song.  Crazy Paul.  Crazy Paul.  Crazy Paul.  Hey, man, I can barely hear you.  We're on 38, man.  And he talks to Ben Frank McLean.  A bunch of people from Pennsylvania.  Join us.  There are people with all the pants coming.  I'm like, this is turning into a loony, man.  As you hear John Glenn entering the atmosphere, we're losing the signal here on a pole.  Look at this guy.  That was what we just lost, the mercury capsule. 
[02:14:00]  It should regain radio contact soon when it comes back on the other side of the globe.  It did sound like it was entering Earth's atmosphere.  Yeah.  I think that meant they made it over state lines into Pennsylvania.  Not too annoying a sound. 
[02:14:30]  It seems to be going very well, the caravan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the way to Philly with breasts.  And there's going to be a huge party in Philly, man.  I'm so pissed we're not going to be there.  We're stupid.  How the hell did we figure this out?  Let's get a huge party and send it away from where we're going to be.  Brilliant move, Opie.  Sacrificing for the listeners again.  John.  John.  Hey, John.  Yo.  What's up?  You're on the radio. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, how's it going?  Listen, we just got off at exit four on a turnpike.  Yeah.  And some cop in Elmar's car was trying to throw everyone off.  It was pretty funny because he's screaming and yelling through his little PA and nothing was happening.  Oh, really?  So it's not good for a laugh.  All right.  Where are you guys?  I don't know exactly where we are.  We're on some road with traffic lights and stuff.  We're heading for Philly.  What bridge are they taking?  There's like 12 bridges that go to Philly.  Yeah.  Which bridge?  You know, bro?  I don't know.  I think they're making a wrong turn.  I think we're going through the wrong bridge.  I'm not sure what's going on. 
[02:15:30]  Because I don't know.  35 bridges crossed.  So basically, you have nothing to add to this show today.  Well, what I have to add is that the cop tried to throw it, went off, and it was pretty funny because he's like talking on his little microphone and no one listened to him.  So it was good for a laugh.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Later.  It's not about John.  It's about Otto and George playing Caroline tonight.  Man.  And fried galamad.  They got good fried galamad there.  Hey, George didn't say hi to Scorch from Syracuse.  He does the Kingdom of Nakedness radio show in Syracuse. 
[02:16:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Joe DeLion, does he have a club there up there?  I swear to God.  I looked at a house.  Is he an Elvis impersonator?  No, he runs a comedy.  I think he's an Elvis impersonator, too.  He's an Elvis impersonator.  I think I looked at his house.  He's an antriloquism.  I'm pretty sure.  Or nothing but sideburns.  Totally nude.  But yes, I know.  Very well.  Okay.  Naked.  Easy.  Totally dig it.  He runs a failing business in upstate New York.  God, it's true. 
[02:16:30]  See, I told you I knew him.  Hey, hey.  Nude.  Nude.  You guys can't wait for your next hit, right?  Look at you.  There you go.  Twitchy.  What do you got to use?  A pipe?  You roll it up?  No, we got to...  They like the weed.  Twitch went up, man.  I have a Home Depot pipe, man.  Yeah, look at his Home Depot pipe.  How sweet is that, man?  Yeah.  Thank you.  How sweet is that?  Thank you.  An empty pipe.  That's very nice of you.  You want to go...  Just get that right back to him.  There you go, buddy.  Go to the stairwell.  The stairwell?  Yeah, we have to go to the stairwell. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, Stoner, Sean, is the puppet freaking you out, though?  You keep looking at him.  Yeah, he's kind of freaking me out, man.  He's like a midget.  He's like a midget.  He's freaky, right?  He's got the moving eyes and everything, you know?  Reminds me of a dead stripper, man.  That's crazy.  How would you know what that looked like?  So his dad...  His dad reminds him of a dead stripper.  I do that.  That's right.  Ipso facto.  Totally new dead stripper.  I got to go.  So what do you want to eat?  You hungry?  I was like, what?  What do you want to eat? 
[02:17:30]  These guys all don't know.  They don't want to...  No.  Now, that true potheads don't get munchies, right?  They just stay stoned.  You just eat to keep the organism working.  And some Stacker 2.  Yeah.  World's strongest fat burner.  I love Stacker 2.  It's 8-5.  Go drinking.  I'm up all night.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's lost their minds.  Turned out to be a mess today again.  Tommy.  Yo, what's up, fellas? 
[02:18:00]  Hey, man, what's up?  Otto and George, Derek.  The rules are inside there.  Listen, they're on Route 38 going towards the Ben Franklin.  Oh, get to the bridge, drive off a bit.  I'm making a U-turn.  I'm following the street.  This looks like a sick time, bro.  How many people are following the WOW Summit?  Oh, my God, dude.  There's so many people out here.  It's insane.  I ain't seen the traffic on this road in two years.  All right, cool.  There's traffic on that road every single day.  Yeah, but not like this.  Come on, bro.  This is insane.  It's rush hour.  Tommy.  No kidding.  I'm in a truck.  I'm in a truck.  You're not going to tell me about rush hour. 
[02:18:30]  All right, man.  Thank you.  Idiot.  All right, we'll take a break and regroup.  That's what we'll do.  All right.  We can do that.  We've got to do a little catch-up anyway.

[02:21:30]  Yeah.  On the line.  Let's check in with Tim Sabian.  Tim.  You.  Hey, look how psyched you are.  Unbelievable.  Today is the 50th show for Philadelphia.  Can you believe that you've made it this far?  No, I can't.  50 shows.  50 shows for Philly.  And we're doing the WOW Summit today.  A little present from us to you today, sir.  Seems more like 48.  You know, it does.  Is there a difference between 48 and 50?  Absolutely not.  No, no, no, no.  Are you any happier at 50 than you are at 48? 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  We're kind of feeling a little buzz from the Philly area now.  Oh, yeah.  It's feeling good.  I'm telling you, everybody's just waiting.  We're here waiting.  What's going on?  Where are they?  Where are you?  At the station.  Oh, at the station?  I don't know.  They're taking their time, I guess.  They better get to Philadelphia before the end of the show.  Yeah.  Less stops.  Less stops along the way.  I know.  We just want to hear them roaring up.  Well, the problem is there's a lot of people following the caravan at this point.  So they're kind of waiting for people to get through lights and stuff. 
[02:22:30]  Rolling thunder.  Rolling thunder, right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Going to be a big one, Tim.  This, we're going to show you how some of the fans are of this program.  Well, I'll be able to look out my office window here and see it as it whizzes by here.  How are the colors in Philly?  Are they well to haze?  George.  Are they out of line?  A little rowdy?  George.  George, you heard me.  George is in some mood today.  Yeah, he's a puppet. 
[02:23:00]  He's a puppet.  He's very politically incorrect there, Mr. Sabian.  Again, you want to smoke some weed?  It's been eight seconds.  I'm a fucking guy.  We got stoners in the studio.  Otto and George is very bothered by the whole scene.  Take the seeds out or it blows up like an M-80.  I know Chicken Delight.  Chicken Delight.  Remember Chicken Delight?  Yeah, that was good.  Don't cook tonight.  Call Chicken Delight.  We deliver. 
[02:23:30]  Do we have a crowd at Maui or what?  Absolutely.  People are waiting.  We got to find out what exit they're at or what's going on.  Tell them less stops.  I have no clue.  Hopefully, they'll check in soon.  Or if someone has seen the wow, Caravan, give the show a call, okay?  All right, Tim.  All right, buddy.  Enjoy the present we give you today.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  All right.  There you go.  Thanks, guys.  He has no desire to be on the radio when George is yelling and screaming.  Who's that dull suit? 
[02:24:00]  That was Tim Sabian.  He's the program director of WYSP in Philly.  Silch.  There's nothing, right?  Yeah.  Nothing, George?  Yeah.  What's going on in Philly?  Uh, YSP, we're on there now, uh, afternoons.  That's why they're lapping you up.  There's nothing, there's no entertainment in Philadelphia.  The last thing, the last thing to come out of Philly that was good was W.C. Fields.  Yeah?  I liked when the police department blew up the MOVE building.  Oh, yeah.  That was nice.  Yeah.  That was fun.  I know.  The guy was asleep and they shot him 30 times. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, have you seen Al Sharp and he lost a lot of weight?  He looks like a melted candle.  Put the weight back on, you fat monkey.  That's some chicken in prison.  Oh, my God.  Disgusting fat animal.  Well, I cannot sit here and listen to this.  No.  Uh, politically incorrect.  It's outraged.  I am outraged by what, uh, George is saying.  Gentlemen, I am shocked.  Some people, when they lose the weight, they do look like melted candles.  That's a good observation.  You know, he has the biggest head. 
[02:25:00]  And you never realized on that fat body, Al Sharp does.  But now that he's slimmed down, he's still got that big, fat head.  I know.  This looks ridiculous.  Like a jukebox.  He gets out tomorrow out of jail?  Yep.  Yeah.  He'll be going right to, uh...  Yeah, right to Arby's.  No, church is chicken.  I'm on a hunger strike.  Hey, Keith, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  We are in Philadelphia.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Across the estate line.  Finally.  We're in the ghetto of Philadelphia.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  But, uh, I mean, we're in Philadelphia.  What'd I say?  What'd I tell you?  All right.  Hey, left.  We're in route to WYSP, which is posted right around the corner from the Liberty Bell.  Melted candle, fat and spook.  And stop and see the boys there.  Go on around and head over to the bar.  Big-headed, fat, spook, melted candle, dying.  Hold on.  George.  I want to go to Popeye Chicken.  Hold on.  George is losing his mind.  George.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Yep, that crap didn't even make it on the radio.  Wait a minute, George.  Wait a minute.  Uh, Keith, no one heard you.  Let's go, Keith.  Thank you, George. 
[02:26:00]  You are so wrong.  You're going to be good.  You're going to be driving by the radio station in a few minutes?  Yeah, we're trying.  We're making our way up to WYSP right now.  Okay.  We're going to head around a little bit, show off the girls, and make our way over to the bar.  Well, you've got to get to Maui before the end of the show.  Definitely going to happen.  All right, Keith.  I'll be in Maui at about 6.30, 6.40 the latest.  Is there a lot of people following you?  It's unbelievable.  Every 10th mile out of the turnpike, somebody was pulling up alongside of us, gathering inwards. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  Good time.  We've got a lot of people.  Probably about 50 vehicles.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Keith.  All right, talk to you soon.  We'll check in when you get to Maui.  Let's, uh...  Otto?  Yes.  Did you just lean over to George and say that was a good one?  Yeah.  Okay, I just wanted to make sure I was seeing right.  Mental illness.  She hit before he kills you.  Wait, what happened?  After George had that little tirade he just had.  And Otto looks over at him and kind of pats him on the cheek a little and went, that was 
[02:27:00]  a good one.  Oh, because Rick said good one and I don't know if he heard him or not.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  I am petrified.  He's talking to the public.  Wow.  Yeah, sure.  Phil, you're next.  Phil.  Hey, how are you guys?  Good, what's up?  Listen, for anybody who's never seen Otto and George, I recommend they go see him.  I saw them about two months ago.  I thought the guy was going to get killed when he stepped off stage. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, it's not for the faint of heart or the politically correct, because George will  say anything.  He has pissed people off to the point where he got stabbed.  Where'd you see me at?  Yeah, actually, it might have been more than two months ago.  I saw you at West Thorns at Rascals.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  What a show.  What a show.  You live in Philly?  No, no, no, no.  I don't know.  I live in Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Thank you.  He's playing Caroline's tonight, if anyone's in the area.  Yeah, they should go check him out.  The guy is frigging unbelievable.  All right, Phil.  Thank you. 
[02:28:00]  Bye, man.  Good luck.  All right.  Yeah, we talked about this before.  One time, Otto and George, they're doing something in the street, and a guy came up and stabbed  George in the chest.  He was so pissed off.  Yeah.  Injuring Otto's hand.  Puerto Rican.  What do you expect?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Gene, what's up?  Gene.  Gene.  Well, whatever your name is, the 13-year-old.  John.  Sean.  Well, whatever.  It's you.  Your name is Sean?  No, I'm John. 
[02:28:30]  John.  I was talking about Sean.  I was listening to you guys when they first called in.  Yeah.  He's my Messiah.  Hey, buddy.  He is a God.  Wait.  Stoner Sean is your idol?  Yes.  And you're 13 years old?  Yes.  Have you tried drugs yet, John?  Oh, no.  John, why would Stoner Sean be your idol?  Because he's what I'd like to be like.  He's living life.  He's having fun.  You just, you hope that your life ends up like Sean's, where you can just hang out and 
[02:29:00]  get stoned all day.  Yes.  And be on the radio.  And be on the radio.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, John.  Oh, and you guys are doing a great job down there.  I hope you haven't heard it.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Look at that, Sean.  What do you think about inspiring 13-year-olds to completely waste their life away?  I love influencing the young.  Oh, my God.  You know, I can't believe. 
[02:29:30]  How much pot have you smoked?  Some of the stuff we're hearing today.  A bunch.  Awful.  You're scaring Otto.  And he's seen it all.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen someone smile that wide?  Yeah.  The mouth opens, man.  It's like a piranha special on Discovery.  Actually, the best pot buzz is when you're that age, when your brain is still active and  the cells are new.  Yeah.  You can't get stoned now as good as you did at that age.  Now, huh?  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  And he also needs to get a 9mm and start wasting people at school.  Jesus.  He's not hip.  Get with it.  Black trench coat, 9mm.  You're behind the times, I guess.  All right.  Oh, my God.  We're going to have to go to church this Sunday to make up for the last 20 minutes of this  show.  Sean, you ever stop smiling?  No.  You're freaking everyone out.  I do, man.  Sean, when did you start getting high?  When I was like 14, man. 
[02:30:30]  14?  I listened to the chronic.  Yeah.  And it just clued me in.  And you said, I got to smoke some pot.  I was like, that sounds like good times, man.  And then how did you get your hands on pot for the first time?  I don't really remember.  Yeah.  You don't remember?  I think I was coming home from school.  I was at the bus stop.  One of the older kids was like, you want to get high, man?  I was like, yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Let's get high.  God, I never asked you for anything.  Please send down a pot trout.  This guy smokes on his weed when he goes by the airport.  The dogs attack him. 
[02:31:00]  Good luck in prison.  And Sean, you quit your job.  Yeah, I did.  Now you're just doing it.  No.  No.  No, you wouldn't believe it, man.  No, but I was smart, dude.  I quit on payday.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  I had all this money.  And now I got a good three weeks where I can just skate.  I'll worry about that ass later, man.  So you quit on payday. 
[02:31:30]  You got paid.  Then you quit.  So, you know, you got money.  Yeah.  What happens when...  What are you going to do when that money runs out, Sean?  I'm going to school.  I got a dorm room and a fridge.  All right.  Take some classes.  And his favorite movie is Ghost Dad.  I really thought, man, now you got to watch it stoned.  Yeah.  You got to watch it stoned.  They pop you.  Yeah.  Ooh. 
[02:32:00]  A little dig of Jay Moore.  What's up with Jay Moore's movies lately?  The last five-hour movie was like he was looking for a parking space for five hours.  Horrible.  This is no Mel Gibson.  Hey, we have a nice surprise, Anthony.  Yeah.  Brother Joe MPed a song into the show today.  Oh, he finally got the song in.  Give the mic to Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Just got it.  Just got it.  Just checked it out.  Very clean. 
[02:32:30]  All set to go.  It's a Dickie Betts song.  It's a song about Dickie Betts from the Allman Brothers.  You might know Dickie Betts ran into a little trouble lately.  He actually ran into trouble.  The first that we saw was at Asbury Park during the road show we did about a month or so ago.  He had his wife there.  They were on stage having a good time, it seemed.  Great time.  They went backstage.  Shortly after they left, we saw a security squad rushing towards where Dickie and his wife was.  Turns out Dickie was punching his wife in the face. 
[02:33:00]  A hobby he seemed to enjoy because in January he got in trouble for it.  And now it just hit in the news that they were driving their car recently, a couple of days ago.  For some reason they got in a fight.  Dickie wasn't driving, his girlfriend was, or his wife was.  And he leaned over and punched her again in the face.  Dickie seems to like punching his wife in the face.  So, Brother Joe, always quick with the tune.  He's got a song about it already.  Wrote a song about it.  All right, let's listen to Joe's song about Dickie Betts.  Oh, I assaulted you again. 
[02:33:30]  Hitting and kicking and punching you in the head.  When it's time for your beating, you take it like a man.  Yeah, I assaulted you again.  I warned you once and you just kept on being shamed. 
[02:34:00]  I stomped my cowboy boot down on your toes.  But you still didn't get the message, you effing slut.  So I had to break your nose.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Hitting and kicking and punching you in the head. 
[02:34:30]  When it's time for your beating, you take it like a man.  Yeah, I assaulted you again.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Oh, I assaulted you again. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Oh, I was just a little stray boy.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Oh, Iema. 
[02:35:30]  Wow, wow, look at that.  Brother Joe's song about Dickie Bass.  Dickie Bass.  Nice.  Holy ass, man.  Yeah.  Now that's a nice tune.  All right.  Wow, okay.  Dickie, I bet he'd like that.  We have Tanya from Philly on the line. 
[02:36:00]  She's at Maui, the place where the Wow Summit is going to end up, Anthony.  Why don't we check in and see what's going on?  Hello, Anthony.  Hello, Anthony.  Hello, Tanya.  Tanya.  Do you hear enough noise here?  I hear you're just as hot as Melissa.  Yeah, you can say that.  Whoa, I'm confident.  You can say that.  So what's going on down there in Maui?  They are dumb.  They're dying to see boobies. 
[02:36:30]  They want to see boobies.  Let me tell you, when the caravan gets there, there are plenty of girls more than willing to share.  Right.  Guys, there's girls in the way, and they are willing to share.  Obi and Anthony, they are so ready.  Cool.  We got some listeners down in Philly.  This is pretty cool today.  I don't even know how far they are from the bar there.  They're not far.  They're not far?  No, from what they said last time they were on the road, they're not far at all.  All right, cool. 
[02:37:00]  Well, thank you, Tanya.  Oh, you're welcome.  Nice talking to you guys.  When are we going to meet you?  Yeah, we're going to meet her one of these days.  I can't hear you.  These guys are loud.  What did you say?  When are we going to meet the lovely Tanya?  I'll come see you guys next week.  How about that?  All right.  And are you also having an affair with Ken Stevens, our boss?  No, I am not.  I haven't even met him yet.  Oh, really?  Yes, and now it's confirmed that I'm not.  Oh, all right.  Well, thank you.  We'll talk about that later.  Okay, thank you.  We'll lick that. 
[02:37:30]  That didn't make it.  That's funny, though.  It's funny, Otto.  You can't say snatch.  You can't say lick.  Yeah, you can say it like that.  You can say, hey, snatch that from the counter there.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Tim.  Yeah, what's going on?  Which Tim is this?  This is Mark's brother, Tim.  So, Mark's brother.  Oh, what's going on?  Psycho Tim, what's going on?  Psycho Tim.  We just pulled up.  We got over the lodge, took a nice tour of the ghetto.  It was nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We just got here. 
[02:38:00]  There's a lot of people up front.  There's mayhem.  Mayhem here.  Mass hysteria.  Mass hysteria is going on.  All right.  I just want to thank those guys.  Oh, let me have that bike again.  Beautiful bike.  You're at the radio station in Philadelphia?  Yeah, right now.  All right, cool.  I got to check in with Keith.  He's on the other one.  No, he's right here.  He's right here.  All right.  Give him the phone.  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  Keith?  Keith.  I'm standing here with the people from YSP.  Gil from Sales and YSP.  Right on. 
[02:38:30]  We made it.  Not a sale.  Well, listen, Gil.  I would like to extend a Laurel and Hardy handshake.  Welcome.  A Laurel and Hardy handshake.  Actually, they wanted to give that to Earl, but Earl would make the trip.  Yeah.  And Tim's here, too.  All right.  Are the girls flashing the fine people?  Oh, yeah.  The girls are flashing.  We got a lot of fans, too.  We probably got about 100 and 150 fans here from WYSP.  Okay.  Well, let me tell you, there's a lot of people down at the club that are waiting.  Yeah.  We're going from here.  We're going to be here about three or four more minutes, and we're heading right down to  Club Maui. 
[02:39:00]  And how many people followed you, Keith, would you estimate?  I probably 75, 80.  Wow.  Nice.  All total, yeah.  Okay.  We got a lot of people.  We'll get to Maui.  We just checked in with them, and there's a ton of people there.  No, I'll check in with you guys when we get there.  Right on, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  All right.  Bye.  So I can say snatch, but I can't say lick, like, in the licking sense.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Exactly, George.  So it can be a sense.  Okay.  So I tried to snatch.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  No, that doesn't work either.  See, you used the word snatch properly, but then there was some other stuff. 
[02:39:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I have a feeling someday, George.  So, Mitch, what do you want to eat?  I have a feeling George was smoking a lot of dope with Stoner Sean today, man.  Dude, it's really wild.  You got to see it, Stoner.  You got to see this racist puppet story, man.  It's a bug out, man.  All right.  Tom, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, Stoner Sean?  How you doing, man? 
[02:40:00]  That's too hot a question.  He wants to know how you're doing.  I'm not doing all right.  So, what are your views on George W. Bush?  You think he's a pothead, man?  He's got to be smoking something.  I don't know.  I have no clue.  Who?  I don't care.  Who's that guy?  I don't give two ass.  What the hell are you all about?  I'll get in the coffin and die.  Yeah, exactly.  Sorry.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can't say that. 
[02:40:30]  You can't say that.  Oh, the Negro and the Hebrew should be friends.  Just the Negro and the Hebrew should be friends.  Hey, Tim.  Yeah?  This is the program director of the station.  They're taking over the station.  What's up, Tim?  They're all down here.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, it's a best-in crowd, George.  No, George.  It's a best-in crowd, George. 
[02:41:00]  Sour crowd.  Oh, my God.  Get in the oven.  You got a nice crowd at the station.  They're all coming out of my house.  Hey, that's cool.  Looks like I'm on the way to my house now.  All right.  Wow.  And we're not there.  No.  We're missing this.  Great.  Tim.  Hi. 
[02:41:30]  You guys taking pictures, hopefully, for us?  What, Tim?  Are you taking pictures for us, hopefully?  I can barely hear you.  I just hang up on him.  Screw it.  That was enough for you.  You gave him a chance.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  We'll wrap up this mess next.  O.P.  Anthony.  Join ONA at Hooters on 56 between Broadway and 7th Avenue this Thursday after the show.

[02:43:30]  Otto and George in the studio.  Playing Carolines tonight.  The most politically incorrect comic you'll ever see, I believe.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Otto and George.  Otto, you're not worried about people, like, attacking you on stage?  Yeah.  All it would do is make the hype, and it would help ticket sales.  As long as they don't chop off my puppet hand. 
[02:44:00]  You know, I'll take a beating.  I don't care.  You know what it is?  You seem like such a nice guy without the puppet.  You've got to liven things up.  And then you get George, and it just gets ugly.  Give me that.  What happened?  I've got to tell you, this guy, Mitch, the quiet guy, this is the guy who brought me to the Allman Brothers show.  Yeah.  We had some fun that night, right?  Did Dickie Betts punch his wife that night?  No, no.  We had tequila, weed, blow.  Then we went to Hogs and Heifers. 
[02:44:30]  That sounds like a nice night.  Look at that.  And then he bribed the guy in the band $100 to sing one Allman Brothers song.  No way.  Yeah.  And the guy goes, we don't play Allman Brothers.  And he goes, here's $100.  And they started.  The guy goes, we don't do that, Matt.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  $100, and then you got to sing a ton.  Yeah.  What song did you do?  One Way Out.  One Way Out.  One Way Out, yeah.  Why not?  They should go on the road like that.  He's a regular Calico Jackson, Oceanside.  You heard of that joint, right?  First time I'm hearing of it. 
[02:45:00]  You know what they should, some bands should do that.  Some of those dying bands, you pay to get in, and then you have to pay extra if you want  to sing tunes with them.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you imagine that?  Yeah.  Like you get up there with Def Leppard, sing a tune, a warrant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More beers.  More beers, woo.  All right.  Let me go to Don.  Don, what's up?  Hey, Don.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You're on the radio.  All right.  Listen, I just went past the Maui down here in Philly.  I got wowed by about 60 girls out there. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, that's beautiful.  Unbelievable.  Hey, one other thing before I go, man.  Yeah.  Don't send black girl down here, because he's like hamburger, and we want pizza here in Philly.  Pizza.  That was good.  All right, Don.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  You suck.  All right.  A few What Have We Learned coming in, Anthony.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned there's a girl walking around the tri-state area with pork written on Das Dube.  Dube Pierre.  I learned Darth Vader will be in episode seven.  The Empire Strikes Somewhere Over There. 
[02:46:00]  Gravity plus time equals sagging.  Hey, can we see her boobs again, Laura?  Her boobs are up on opieandanthony.com.  Isn't that great?  We share with you guys.  She came in today, and she was a real sport.  Full-figure teen equals low self-esteem.  And she's going to be at the next WOW sticker stop in the New York area, right?  Yes, I will.  Helping out Earl.  All right.  Steve writes, what did I learn today?  Pedophiles love Cheez-Its.  The left boob is bigger from the days of archery.  Al Sharpton looks like a big melted candle. 
[02:46:30]  Otto is now at the point where he has to stroke the puppet's ego.  And Hugo checking in saying, I learned the little blue thread really completes the Home Depot pot pipe.  He did learn that today.  He was?  Oh, Keith's checking in one last time.  He finally made it to Club Maui.  Oh, great.  Keith the Cop.  We have finally reached our destination.  That's got it for me. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  I think everybody is very happy to see us.  Wow, and we can't even be there.  God damn it.  I think we're making the New York listeners a little jealous, Anthony.  Yeah, you know something?  I think you're right.  Hold on one second, a little bit.  The phone is gating out on him because of the noise.  Right.  It's funny because, like, the new cities, they don't really, you know, know what to do in that situation.  Like, in New York, that would be an O&A chant.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, well, that's okay.  It's pandemonium.  All right, Keith.  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Nice crowd, obviously.  Yeah, we made it here, finally.  Okay.  Probably got about 300, 400 people from YST here.  And I think we're very well received.  And are the girls wowing?  Hold on one second.  It's a little hard to hear.  Okay.  That's great.  Okay, go ahead. 
[02:48:00]  I can hear you.  Are the girls wowing, hopefully?  The girls are wowing.  Plenty of wow going.  Right.  It's nice.  A lot of girls.  All right.  Hold on one second.  Who wants to be the first girl from Philly to wow?  Here we go.  We got our first girl from Philly.  She's coming up on the stage.  Oh, what a day.  That's it.  Very, very nice, fellas.  It's like planting the flag in the moon.  Yeah, it's like planting the flag in the moon or something similar. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, there it is.  The first boom in Philly.  That is great.  Boy, the love from Philly.  Where the hell did that come from?  Isn't that great?  That's cool.  Cleveland, you're next.  Keith, thank you.  No problem, fellas.  I'll talk to you later on.  We're going to have drinks and relax.  Are you guys taking pictures, hopefully, for the website?  Plenty of pictures.  All right, cool.  Okay, I've got to go.  I'm enjoying myself way too much.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Listen to the crowd.  Got to give Keith a lot of credit.  He came up with the Wow Summit idea, and he pulled it off, I do believe.  What a great idea to pull cities together. 
[02:49:00]  You know what I mean?  We've been here in New York for over three years.  Just started in Philly.  It's our 50th show.  And look at the love.  God damn, that's great.  I bet his phone sucks.  Well, you know what it was?  I think it was the noise.  They have stuff in the phone that cut out when it gets too loud.  Al writes today, I learned that Patty is now giving oral favors in Sunoco bathrooms.  Yes, it's my big mandibles.  Also, I learned the last time Rich Vosch changed his act, the Yankees pitched Rudy May on three days rest. 
[02:49:30]  That's the first time I ever crossed over a bridge when we went into Philly.  Usually my colony just puts a branch or a leaf across the water, and we go that way.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Obi-Wan Devote is Darth Vader's father.  Yes, Obi-Wan Devote.  Take it easy, boy.  Yeah, Earl left in a huff again today.  He left the building.  Obi-Wan Devote is a Jedi sales whore.  Learned from the master. 
[02:50:00]  Jedi sales whore.  Frank, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Today I learned that Opie likes to take it on the chin.  I thought you'd forget that one.  You know, in the wrong context, everything is insulting.  A lot of people are pissed because we didn't play the audio of the hissing cockroaches.  Oh, yeah.  We had too much going on today.  From the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We will start the show with that tomorrow if someone reminds us, okay?  Tomorrow we have our signing, too.  Our magazine signing at Hooters. 
[02:50:30]  Right after the show.  We're hoping for a nice crowd down there.  Fox is going to be filming the thing for something they're doing with Bill O'Reilly.  I learned Anthony won't be signing Time Magazine, but he will be signing a Mary-Kate and Ashley  Scary Mystery.  Right on.  That's going to be at Hooters right after the show tomorrow.  56 between 7th and Broadway.  Does anyone tape in any news agencies make it to Philly today?  Tape some of that?  Hopefully.  There's some fuel.  Why wasn't Bill O'Reilly's team over there?  He'd have gotten some nice T-shirts.  Are you guys going to do anything in Dallas, like as far as a motorcade with wowing people 
[02:51:00]  and a grassy knoll?  You should really do that.  That would rhyme.  Drive up in a presidential limo and, you know, flashing people would be excellent.  We could do something like that.  Right when it rounds the corner.  Oh, yeah.  That his head flew off in.  Then you have the party at Parkland Memorial Hospital.  It's perfect.  You smoke your weed on the landing near the x-ray room.  I want to get into Otto's head one day.  Wouldn't that be good?  You've got some things going on in your head, bro. 
[02:51:30]  I have issues.  Can you show the stoner guys George's impression of JFK?  Check this out, dude.  You've got to see it's stoned, though.  Wait.  JFK's brain.  Actually, it's a toad's brain.  If you want to lick it, it might get a nice freeze.  George's head.  I'm like an inside-out Oreo.  I like the racist puppet, dude.  Let's get stoned with him.  I want to go get a totally nude weed. 
[02:52:00]  Let's go.  We've got to thank everyone that made this show a mess today.  Otto and George playing Caroline tonight.  Thank you, Otto.  10 o'clock.  Thank you, George.  Thank you, Opie.  And I learned Scorch has a hot date for tomorrow.  Yeah.  That is tomorrow.  Thank you, Laura, for flashing all day long in the studio.  Yeah, that works, man.  Grab that snatch off the counter.  Her pictures are up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  And tomorrow on the show, Blind Dave and Blind Matt coming in for their lap dances. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, they are.  Yes.  The guys that did the blind boxing for us.  Yeah.  Can't see anything.  And we promised them some lap dances, so they're going to get the ultimate lap dance.  That's great.  Do you think they're going to try this thing?  No, no, no.  No, we're getting them real chicks.  Yeah, we wouldn't do that to those guys.  They're going to read the areola like Braille.  Yeah.  What is that?  I feel a bump here.  I'll be at Joanne's and Mindhill on the 31st with Joe Piconi.  Who's that? 
[02:53:00]  Hey, let me say it again.  I didn't get it.  I'll be at Joanne's and Mindhill on the 31st with Joe Piconi.  Oh, man, we're dumping out like crazy.  All right.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  I learned today that sneaky roommate eats Cheez-Its.  Hey, yeah, Stinky's roommate.  Does he eat Cheez-Its?  I think Stinky finally moved out, right?  Did he?  He's out of that house?  No longer living with the pedophile.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, thank you. 
[02:53:30]  All right, we got to get out.  Yeah, look at the time.  All right, well, what a day for Wow, huh?  Yes.  It's across a couple of state lines.  What a great time.  In Philly, we'll get the updates tomorrow on the show.  Hopefully, we'll have some pictures to show you guys.  Come down to Caroline's tonight.  Meet the great Mitch Lewis.  And we'll go to Hogs and Heppers.  All right, Ribbon.  All right.  Very good.  Otto and George.  Thank you, Otto. 
[02:54:00]  Thank you.  Thank everybody.  Scorch and everyone else that showed up today and made the show a lot of fun today.  The Stoner guys, thank you.  And we're out of here, Anthony.
