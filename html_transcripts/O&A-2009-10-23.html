<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The October 23rd, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show began with a fiery post-game analysis of the previous night's Yankees-Angels playoff game.  Opie and Anthony unleashed a torrent of expletives criticizing the Yankees' pitching, particularly A.J. Burnett and the bullpen.  They also lambasted the excessive noise from fans, specifically targeting "thunder dicks" (thunder sticks) and comparing the game atmosphere to the irritating presence of an air horn.  The disruptive nature of television commercials during the game also drew their ire.  Numerous listener calls followed, detailing annoying fan behaviors at various sporting events: cowbells at Rays games, a "woo guy" at Cubs games, a pan-and-spoon player at Yankee games, "Jim Norton" announcers at Bruins games, and Rick Flair's "Woo!" appearances at Hurricanes games. One caller highlighted the difference in commercial breaks between English and Spanish game broadcasts.  The hosts also criticized a "weird" DirectTV commercial featuring resurrected actors Chris Farley and David Spade.  A call about a contentious marital situation involving an affair and a subsequent 911 call added another layer to the chaotic discussion.  A "Jocktober" segment included a parody song, "How You Doin'," about the Yankees, followed by a review of other baseball-themed parody songs from various radio stations, most of which were harshly criticized.  The show concluded this section with further discussion of the Steve Phillips scandal.  Patrice O'Neal and Joe DeRosa were mentioned as scheduled guests.

The show then shifted to a scathing critique of Opie and Anthony's former radio station, 92.3 Now, mocking its low Twitter following (around 2200), its poor advertising (advertising for radio advertising), and its weak on-air personalities, contrasting it sharply with their own past success. This led to a homophobic rant about boy bands and a broader discussion of current pop music, including Yankees-themed parody songs by Foe Onassis and Tic Tac and the Freak Show, and the station's overuse of texting promotions.  A listener called about a Miley Cyrus music video. The conversation then broadened to music sampling in hip-hop, touching upon Jay-Z, Vanilla Ice, and Biggie Smalls, and sparked debates about originality and copyright infringement, including a discussion of a Phillies-themed parody song using the Black Eyed Peas' "I Got a Feeling." A significant portion of this segment involved listener calls and further critiques of 92.3 Now and Z100, interspersed with the playing and criticism of more Yankees-themed songs, including a harshly criticized parody by Scott and Todd.  Finally, in-studio guests Patrice O'Neal and Joe DeRosa arrived.  A considerable portion of the segment focused on DeRosa's significant weight loss, punctuated by humorous and somewhat mean-spirited teasing of his appearance.  The conversation also covered the films *Paranormal Activity* and *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, with opinions on which were genuinely scary.

The next segment focused on the definition of "scary," discussing horror movies and paranormal experiences. Opie, Anthony, O'Neal, and DeRosa debated horror techniques, referencing *The Exorcist*, *The Ring*, and *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, including a detailed discussion of a memorable scene from *The Exorcist*. Personal paranormal experiences and beliefs were shared, leading to a plan to film the hosts spending a night in a haunted location. Listener calls, prompted by DeRosa's upcoming Stress Factory shows, heavily influenced the discussion, primarily focusing on listener pressure to include another comedian, Bobo, in DeRosa's show.  After much resistance, DeRosa eventually agreed,  driven by the threat of ticket cancellations.  The segment ended with further discussion of Bobo's performance and upcoming shows.


The show then introduced Bobo, who was subjected to a humorous "hazing" process by Opie and Anthony.  The hosts negotiated with Bobo over his joke selection, which included a joke about psychiatric drugs and another about new bus announcements.  Bobo engaged in extensive and often offensive crowd work, insulting audience members based on their jobs, physical attributes, and religion. The absence of another comedian, "The Virus," became a running comedic element, with attempts to coax him onto the show.  Bobo was also challenged to a spelling bee. A fictional radio drama segment, "Suicide vs. Anger Man," featuring Bobo, was briefly played.  The Virus finally appeared, but his inability to deliver a punchline became the focus of comedic ribbing.

The final segment featured a heavily intoxicated or impaired Virus, repeatedly urged by the hosts to deliver a punchline, but failing to do so.  Opie, Anthony, and Bobo directed numerous fat jokes at Virus, using references to *Police Academy*, *Transformers*, Windows Vista, and *Lost*.  The segment ended with Virus's continued failure to deliver a punchline, resulting in more crude and offensive commentary from the hosts and promotion of upcoming comedy shows.  The tone remained highly irreverent and vulgar throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  ah good morning we are live hi friday october 23rd 2009 that's right we had it delayed the  beginning of the show because uh i had to make duties oh is that what it was oh my god i was  wondering what level of importance it was very important i'm usually very regular but today 
[00:00:30]  i went uh-oh gotta make my duty uh-oh my duty kind of embarrassing when everyone's waiting for  you because you're in the bathroom and you can't pinch it off so disgusting so i go to bed last  night it's four zip and i'm like all right well this game's over the yankees got to come home to  do it they want to win it at home anyway it's good for business good for business for the team  to win it at home yeah then i wake up this morning and i see it was seven six uh the yankees lost over 
[00:01:00]  the angels i'm going what the fuck there was some kind of comeback that i missed while i was sleeping  it certainly was a great comeback and uh then a great blow it they just couldn't fucking close the  deal they could they were ahead by two and then uh the pitching staff just blew fucking monkey ass  yeah first of all a.j burnett gets up there and just like he he stunk up the joint right from the 
[00:01:30]  first fucking pitch he's walking people he's fucking the day run the four runs in the first inning  nice right yeah oh beautiful to watch that's beautiful they stuck with him and then he seemed  to like calm down he was you know getting some uh uh he was barely hanging on but i mean at least  they weren't scoring anymore and then the yankees get up and uh you know i believe it was what the 
[00:02:00]  sixth inning something like that and uh they score big they start smashing some balls and getting getting  some runs and uh but their bullpen was atrocious last night they couldn't you know the angels they  could go to their bullpen drag some guy out except for oliver that was funny they dragged that poor  bastard out and uh wow he got pasted he got slack he got shellacked and um but for the most part they 
[00:02:30]  could go to the bullpen and you know shut him down one two three one two three they're out our bullpen  it was just it was constantly sitting there going oh okay here's another first and third situation  no outs oh and then here comes jabba chamberlain my favorite jabba comes out fuck him  and then uh until rivera got out there for you know part of an inning and closed everyone down that 
[00:03:00]  was nice but then they couldn't come back uh from the one run deficit they had bases loaded  bottom of the ninth full fucking count it was just one of these on ice on fucking nick i can't hit the  fucking ball switcher well because of the the those sticks the thunder sticks the thunder sticks  nothing has to do with thunder sticks he got distracted by the thunder sticks what do they  call thunder sticks thunder dicks how could anyone i'm watching that last night and it's just a low 
[00:03:30]  level noise in the background when nothing's happening nothing's happening  i don't just imagine going through your day  i don't know how anyone in their right fucking mind can sit next to people  that are doing that and and try to enjoy the game like like if you're not into the thunder  stick thing you'd be sitting there going shut the fucking stop hitting them together 
[00:04:00]  i'm trying to sit here and watch the game you ever been near air horn guy during a sporting event  oh my god you jump out of your skin in his mouth oh really but fucking the the it's not like  everyone in the park has an air horn that's what this is everyone's a boom boom boom boom boom no it's  yeah it is so horrible so why don't the yankees turn it into air horn night they should just hand out 
[00:04:30]  air horns to everybody you imagine the second the batter goes to swing it would be it would just sound  like they they kind of they kind of look the other way for one air horn yeah but i guess they would  frown upon thousands of people with air horns at the same time wow wow is right oh well you know  those deals where it was like but you wanted the yankees to lose it's so much more exciting when the team 
[00:05:00]  wins at home come on you know that oh i know i know look they they got two more chances to win i  think they'll do it right when they get back really that game's not being played anytime soon  saturday it's gonna be a rain out it's gonna rain all day long the goddamn rain um another thing i  found a little disturbing during last night's game that had nothing to do with the game it was the  commercials well how they're really loud now well even louder than usual that's been 
[00:05:30]  yeah forever but they're slowly turning that volume up when we're not looking a little they're just  just ticking it up well there's two commercial issues i have one of which is uh gee could you get  back to the game while the pitch is in mid-fucking air they are squeaking and squeezing by with commercials  where i swear to you they come back the pitch is on its way to the batter and they're making the call 
[00:06:00]  like baseball has so much down time to begin with they could they don't need to do that no no i mean  and and how long was the game yesterday because i was up pretty late and and it had a long way still to  go there's there's an article in the paper today they're pitching complaining that all right enough  already with the length of these five hours well that's another talking about also trying to maybe  bring uh some video into some of the calls to make them a little more but you know for next year  obviously yeah they can't do it now but then people are arguing geez the games are long enough 
[00:06:30]  who needs this but there's been so many bad calls this series um so but the the other thing with the  commercials was i i that i found a little disturbing i don't know why uh was the chris farley  oh david spade commercial uh it doesn't make sense by the way where he's talking about i guess they  figured out direct tv i guess they figured out that david spade isn't popular anymore by himself 
[00:07:00]  yeah but to squeeze some popularity out of the guy they bring like the dead chris farley back dead chris  farley now this is a campaign they've been using for a while it's uh actors they they put them back  into scenes from famous famous scenes from movies they've been in sure and then they they sit there  and talk about how direct tv could get you this and that and the other thing and uh most of them have  been you know king kong they did that one recently um but none with dead people and it was a little 
[00:07:30]  weird that david spade sitting on the couch saying yeah i gotta be a fatso over here and something  like that and and it it's dead guy direct tv's got a back to the future one too oh really uh oh  uh and someone's saying doc brown or is it uh oh yeah it's doc brown geez uh and someone is saying  if you didn't watch the entire game don't comment on it what that's what he's saying well who didn't  watch the entire game you fuck hunt i said i did it i said i went to bed when it was four zip but 
[00:08:00]  anthony that's anthony just filled me in perfectly on what happened after i i went to uh sleepies  yeah believe me i watched the whole game so you don't like the dead chris farley commercial  no it's i'm not sure if i don't like it it just was weird when i saw it i just kind of went like  ooh because it's you know a fat guy in a little coat he's doing that whole bit yeah and um yeah  it's yeah it's a little weird yeah just to see dead guy in commercial all right let's go to steve in 
[00:08:30]  tampa steve what's up oh good morning good morning steve love you love the show love the show yeah  hey um nothing's worse than those rays fans they have those huge cow bells they're ringing in your ear  all game long oh my god it's atrocious god could you how do you sit there how many how many cowbells  made into the raise games uh last year oh probably uh 20 000 for real for real everybody has a cowbell 
[00:09:00]  they have them in gift shops they have them everywhere oh my god i would have to strangle  somebody of course i would go much i almost did of course like most human beings i would go for the  very easy target some old grandma with a cowbell but i would have to strangle somebody yeah i'm not  going to strangle the fucking you know gangster yeah what one guy member you're right one cowbell  is annoying is annoying enough oh yeah the fucking shade guy has that all right do it once in a while 
[00:09:30]  if like there was a like a reason to or is an exciting part but like he'll do that for every little  thing like anytime there's a new batter like it's like bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk just it's like  look at me everybody shut the fuck games about me every sports team uh has that guy and dude and if  if they don't have that guy then everyone else is trying to be that guy for their sports team yeah  like fireman ed at the jets game he's he's the guy now fire the islanders don't have a guy but 
[00:10:00]  there's a bunch of people in the stadium trying to do their thing hoping it's going to catch on you  loudville oh yeah i know we have loudville shut the fuck up you fucking montreal canadians  fan go how about yourself how about you and fuck your team no win a game guy now we got one we  squeezed out a win two nights ago but but we couldn't beat the stupid canadians 5-1 loss for 
[00:10:30]  the islanders i'll always say it that if your team needs like to hand fucking props out to the  crowd it's so hack and that's because your team doesn't do it though man no no i i i was saying  you know boston doesn't do it either they're just they're they're the big time teams and then there's  the teams that need to fucking have little props and the towels that they wave around and you're  you're saying they need distractions because they're not true sports fans they need distractions 
[00:11:00]  it's just a  is this mets guy that's guy sucks  see he's becoming the guy though for the mets  and that's all he does by the way it's like the bottom of the first and it's no score  probably nothing going on there and it carries so far like you don't even have to be in that section  you could be across the stadium is still here yeah let's say hi to tyler in indiana tyler

[00:13:30]  connecticut chris ah good morning i just love you guys what's up mad dog hey hey oh guys  yeah this is fucking jorani came that came away last night man they had a fucking lockdown  when it's locked down and he fucking varied from what he did all year he brings bernette out after  sitting on the bench for 20 minutes last night and that fucking two out six runs fucking inning they 
[00:14:00]  had uh i i i know but but it wasn't even just bernette it wasn't even just bernette that whole  fucking bullpen stunk until rivera came out it it it it fucking stunk oh he fucking yeah he brought  out bernette and bernette let those first two guys on first base hit and he walks the guy then  fucking he brings into marzo fucking marty or whatever the fuck oh yeah instead of coke did 
[00:14:30]  you ever bought a coke yeah i know that was weird what the fuck and then they had a stall while they  got rivera ready so they're like just all you saw was java making like five uh throws to first oh  really yeah that's smart and then they're taking that should be illegal time time that should be illegal  and they should realize they're doing that on purpose girardi comes out and he's like all right  well you guys got to face the facts that girardi's just not getting the job done joe tory would have  uh put this thing to bed already well he's making some bad decisions yeah yeah he he's i was looking 
[00:15:00]  at him as a great manager but you know the team's got the talent well uh the talent he was being  crucified the other day for uh making too many pitching changes and uh during that 11th inning loss  and last night he now he's taking some shit for uh for not uh making enough changes or changes that  should have been made uh bernett just he didn't have it last night it was so obvious when he was 
[00:15:30]  slapped for fucking four runs in the first inning like that uh that he just didn't have it but when you  have a six four lead hold the fucking lead start doing some some shit to hold the fucking lead  like get some get some talent out there yeah coke should have fucking went out there yeah that's  what i mean they had it it's fucking done the gate just bring out whoever you have to to get the  fucking thing done you did it all year when you're the league hey man oh you brought out yours you 
[00:16:00]  fucking the yankees did it for the yankees did it for you you fans they you know now they win it at  home it makes it that much sweeter for you guys yeah unless they have a major collapse which will make  some some people happy and i am just getting pissed when matt suey gets up there stop laughing  i'll be your fucker don't look at my sports teams i have nothing to laugh at i suck  matt suey the big jump he can't seem to get a fucking hit i don't understand what the  fuck it is they get up there he's looking at strikes going right by him uh they are not even swinging 
[00:16:30]  on him and when he does he misses the ball does matt suey even all right does matt suey even know  he's in the playoffs because i have no idea he shows no fucking emotion you know that picture  that we all like kind of tweeted and uh of uh who was grabbing whose ass a rod was grabbing jeter's  ass jeter's ass in that celebration of that home run yeah in that same photo matt suey's just staring  blankly at the field like does this guy show any emotion no no he doesn't uh it's bizarre and then um 
[00:17:00]  um one of one of the highlights that like made me laugh gave me a little hope was um  when uh social took out fucking uh lackey and put in oliver  and and and lackey's on the mound going this is he was saying you could read his lips he's going this  is mine yeah this is mine so this is mine i got this well a lot of people are questioning that move 
[00:17:30]  because what he had a shutout going into the seventh inning yeah it was still a shutout right  he was doing good he was getting a little bit all right he was getting a little more trouble than  he was earlier in the game but uh wow that turned out to be a bad and then they just got  fucking nailed but you never know i mean nine out of ten times that probably works you know in their  favor well you know that's why baseball is a weird fucking sport he had to fucking leave the dugout he  was so he was pissed off fucking pissed and you could see it he doesn't get the win now either uh no what after 
[00:18:00]  five well well seven six so yeah uh and he left when it was a four zip lead jared in boston what  do you got hey there's uh these couple of guys i swear it's every single boston bruins home game  they must be seeing ticket holders they sit way at the top of the ball at one end and all they say  the entire game is jim norton november 28th at the wilburtheater wilburtheater.com for tickets  oh those asses they yell that every fucking game you gotta be kidding me steve in north carolina 
[00:18:30]  hey uh the uh down here in the back carolina hurricanes games we have rick flair up on the  jumbotron yelling woo dressed up in a hurricane jersey  oh no oh no and that gets the crowd going yeah yeah unfortunately it does um but uh yeah go on  google and uh google rick flair woo hurricanes and you'll see it it's terrible right hurricanes alice 
[00:19:00]  let's go to angelo from staten island angelo hey guys good morning it sounds like a big fan  a long time first line right uh what i'm calling about is uh on channel nine locally is uh you know  the the they have this spanish the sap station of the game and they televised everything uh you they  don't have a ton of commercials you don't miss anything and i i feel like as a an american we're  getting robbed we're missing out you know they're giving fox just does commercial after commercial 
[00:19:30]  well on channel nine you're able to catch everything you don't miss one pitch you actually  see the guys in the dugout i mean you get a lot more coverage of course i can't understand the  damn thing right but that could be good because you can figure out the action yourself you don't  need that babbling sometimes yeah exactly exactly and you got freddie at the yankee at yankee stadium  if you ever look at freddie the guy that you hit the he walks around with a pan the guy's got  one eye somebody scooped his eye out back in the seventies i don't know i don't know what happened

[00:33:00]  address this so many times on like twitter and everything um hi tony well i mean it is true you just  start this man i just i i'm just trying to understand uh-huh you know what you're dealing  with that's all so i'm not trying to abuse you i hear you help me out here man let let me explain  because uh he's like aunt when did you become this big yankee fan i've always been a yankee fan been a  big big yankee fan but of late there has not really been much to talk about with the yankees 
[00:33:30]  it goes down to the end of the season they fucked it up a rod sucked a dick he wasn't able to do  that they couldn't pull it off they couldn't get fucking past uh yeah yeah they just couldn't  fucking uh uh win so what was i supposed to talk about boring fucking yankee talk about that and no  one wanted to hear it because now that they're winning i could talk about it on the air it's not 
[00:34:00]  like i didn't talk about it or watch the games or or or or something uh uh years before if you  if you remember if you remember there were many arguments between somebody that uh used to produce  the show that was a big big red sox fan and i remember and we would go back and forth and when  the yankees had that big meltdown uh i lost my fucking mind um that that is why all of a sudden  everyone thinks i'm just this yankee fan this year go back to aaf fucking tapes and listen 
[00:34:30]  i was talking about it back then i don't know i don't have access to that i'm into it this year  because i don't have access to that i don't think anyone does because no one gave a  shit for the most part about us okay we were still building our careers who erased the tape  i would love to get an af tape of you talking about the yankees that i don't know if someone  has that please send it in question yeah wait can i ask you a question when did you start going to  the games though like i mean that's the other thing i know my god i mean yeah i've been listening

[00:40:30]  it out in the house what's that about i can't figure out during this time of year it's very  odd you know in the summer you put your air conditioner on right right hot outside you put  your air conditioner down winter you put the fucking heat on sure but this has been like  some days are nice and then the nights get cold so i don't know i turn my because i have radiant  heating on my floors what's that that's like you got tile floor but when they put it in they run all 
[00:41:00]  these uh like water lines through it through the floor before they put the tile on and then you turn  the heater on the floor and the tiles get nice and warm you got a heated floor yeah and and it's  great when you're in your socks and stuff like that because then it's all people are losing their jobs  up there shut up your tootsies people are out of work shut up don't complain about your heated  floors go fuck yourself i lived in my car uh i had a heated floor too heated floors exhaust 
[00:41:30]  wow but but then i i put that on and then um i turn the air conditioner on so they're kind of duking  it out it is because because it's it sometimes it gets nice and warm on your tootsies people are  trying to figure out how to feed their families right now shut up and i haven't about your dilemma 
[00:42:00]  my timers i haven't reset my my timers for the winter yet right so the heat will turn on and  then off at certain times that's a real problem that is a hell of a problem that's a that's i have  going for myself never said it was a problem just said it was happening that's a nice luxury my friend  it's not as uh i don't think it's quite as bad as having every tv on in the house with the game on so  no matter where i am in the house i don't miss uh well that's just part of the game that's just 
[00:42:30]  the carbon footprint print yeah yeah whatever gotta do that hey this is a quickie everyone's  talking about this uh contessa brewer introducing jesse jackson as somebody else oh yeah just in case  people haven't heard it i said as someone else but i think most people have heard this by now  but this is this is great listen to this from msnbc specifically brian griffith says quote we have  to tolerate the inequality as a way to achieve greater prosperity and opportunity for all he 
[00:43:00]  says in return for those big salaries and bonuses well bankers just should turn around and give more  money to charity he made that statement in london yesterday during a discussion of morality in the  marketplace well tell that to the guys making ten bucks an hour joining me now to talk about this  and the nation's real problem of joblessness the reverend al sharpton what's your reaction to  hearing someone say you know uh when it comes to income inequality all's well the rising tide floats  all boats oh i'm reverend jesse jackson right i don't you know i'm so sorry the uh the script in 
[00:43:30]  front of me said reverend al sharpton i'm looking at your face i know who you are reverend jackson we all  do i'm sorry you all look alike oh my goodness gracious that's hysterical see there's a lot going  on in that clip proving our point the point that they're just news readers and we'll just read 
[00:44:00]  whatever the fuck is in front of them she just blurred have no actual opinions or thoughts in  their head it's written down i'm looking at your face i know who you are then why did you say it  because it was written down because i just read i'm a reader i'm a news reader plows through  whatever's on the paper is that what you do how great is that you know what though it's uh i said  well you're both uh two um big uh bullshitting lumps of crap so uh i i mistook you for the other one  you're both race baiting fucking racists that uh try to say they're doing uh good things for the 
[00:44:30]  community so sorry you you can see how he easily made that mistake interchangeable yes coke logic  writes heated floors ed begley jr is throwing up somewhere ed begley's we got to pedal his ass off  to make up for what i'm doing and steven s and bayshore i i knew we shouldn't just like moved on  from your heated floor problem steven s from bayshore writes in a related problem anthony's caviar 
[00:45:00]  fridge keeps uh icing up yes big problem there and we're getting a request for ted's phone sex  emporium travis play that uh going to the next break for us will you i'd appreciate that yeah  hey you want to move into jocktober because it's a baseball theme today that is fantastic we could do  that actually you want to do let's do the 9-1-1 call first then we seg into jocktober what's the 9-1-1  call well this steve phillips story that we broke a couple days ago all right uh where he was uh kind 
[00:45:30]  of having an affair on his on his wife with some young 21 22 year old frump frump she's definitely  a frump they have been just hanging her in the paper you read what they're saying about her i haven't  read an article since we oh it's fantastic they're just talking about why would he uh threaten his uh his  marriage uh over her she's a dumpy frumpy uh a stalker like they have really been ripping her to 
[00:46:00]  shreds she's got crazy eyes she's a fatal attraction yeah and i thought we were going to be the only ones  that came out in support of steve phillips i really did yeah but no in this case everyone's like this  broad is not lunatics and there's been uh like um editorial pieces in the paper about  uh dating like crazy chicks and having an affair with crazy chicks and and the danger that is  involved with that because they will do just insane things right they just fall in love and uh and and 
[00:46:30]  decide after a couple of uh of fuckings that uh you're the guy for them and uh you're in a relationship  with somebody else that's got to end so she writes a letter to the wife and apparently she dropped  that letter off right on the front stoop or something that's great and then sped away in  her car because the wife was coming and hit a big stone wall with her car in front of the house 
[00:47:00]  yeah i don't know any of this oh it's fantastic this is all details i'm finding out for the first  time look at her she looks like a guy yeah she uh she kind of looks like a in-shape younger ziggy  only about 20 people will get that fine comedic line by me the opster but  she doesn't look like a young ziggy she got greasy hair so greasy well she probably sucked a 
[00:47:30]  fucking mean cock you know what no she could fall for a good uh blood jab i think she's i'm gonna  speculate i think she's a good egg and probably allows steve phillips to shove her head in a toilet  as he's banging her from behind some of that just asshole just some ridiculous over-the-top  shit that even up that he's not getting from his wife he says he slept with her what twice that's  it oh yeah really so he said really july really is that her right there was that some photo of some 
[00:48:00]  fucking myspace wait wait wait i don't want it's not that good i don't want to pass that over he's  saying he only slept with her twice yeah two he's probably saying that publicly so his wife goes oh you  only slept with her twice oh all right i think we can save this marriage i thought you were sleeping  with her dozens of times yeah she is frumpy yeah she's a she's a frump oh god look that's my  favorite picture with the star wars characters yeah with uh a storm trooper and darth vader and 
[00:48:30]  she's holding a lightsaber or a blaster that's how she holds the cock look at her fucking dumpy  legs he sucks oh he's horrible you fucking ruined your life over that what are you doing  anyway is this following suit like we said steve phillips was suspended by espn but now  we're up to the i we forgot about this one which happens to the i'm gonna take a leave of absence 
[00:49:00]  because my life is completely crumbling around me yeah yeah the leave of absence which if you ask me  it was probably mandatory like the company probably told him you are taking a leave of that well they  basically said look you know you could save face and say that you're taking a leave of absence or we  could just fire you now yeah so i mean he's this guy is so gone because there's a million guys that  could do his job yeah simple as that this is the slow roll out the door and she ain't gonna get fired  because you know they're scared shitless that she'll bring some kind of whacked out sexual harassment 
[00:49:30]  lawsuit against uh the parent company which happens to be disney we were saying that day one also and  now they're starting to uh agree agree and say that uh they probably want fire because they're afraid  of harassment uh by the way none of this is written down we're not news readers we just use our  fucking brains you could figure it all out based on on history hey can i make sure that everyone fully  understands that my line uh you all look alike thomas overbeck from dallas writes you all look alike

[01:08:00]  called what 92.3 now oh all right say goodbye to opie and anthony they were then this is now  well they're really getting the job done aren't they yes they are i haven't heard  fucking nothing about that station i was listening i see a van every once in a while at a sporting  event as and you know what sorry i don't know i don't mean to babble but when you go to a sporting  event you see all the radio stations lined up with their shit they want to give you which is  all just crap yeah and you know some of the new york stations do very well in those situations and 
[01:08:30]  they got a nice crowd around their dumb van right this fucking uh now station i i they they sit there  with their hands in their pocket no one cares enough to get free shit from this uh this station  i was listening to them yesterday and one of the commercials was a commercial telling you to advertise  on radio ah that's where they're at not a good sign and there's it's commercial free mondays i don't 
[01:09:00]  think that i don't i didn't haven't heard any commercials in overnights i was listening on the  drive-in this morning and there was no commercials on oh that could be a problem they also that was a  good move huh boys no morning show no overnight jock yeah they replaced us they replaced us basically  with nothing well chunky is there but not in the morning no he's in the afternoons tearing it up  no actually evenings tearing it up really yes how many people they got following them on their  twitter page over 2500 for a radio station almost almost 2500 people for a whole radio station over 
[01:09:30]  2200 danny's right to correct me fucking assholes yeah you guys know what you're doing in management  good job losers but remember their song uh i'm in new jersey bitch we played it on this show  no no no no recollection from either no no what song is it a real song no it was like a parody of  i'm in miami bitch but it's i'm in new jersey it's coming back to me now yeah yeah well this guy 
[01:10:00]  his name's foe onassis and obviously they just have him do what's his fucking legal name no i think that  is it foe onassis his mom said i'm gonna name my kid foe what foe onassis no that's not his real name  there's an apostrophe in it really yeah i want to see his driver's license well i don't have it but  what is it what does it say in his driver's license foe onassis probably tom fucking yeah king  but um the thing is he did this one too so obviously they just get foe onassis is their go-to 
[01:10:30]  guy all right for uh for a good well for a good parody song well there's a bunch of yankees songs this  year and and uh this is one that's trying to become the song as the yankees try to yeah because they're  world series thing they're all trying to be the next how you doing ha how you doing and 92.3 now  is literally playing this i got a text that said you gotta grab this song i just heard about it i put  on 92.3 now and i only had to wait 15 minutes before the song it's on all the time uh the flea wants in 
[01:11:00]  the flea yeah hey what's up what's up flea uh i just wanted to tell uh anthony uh i i tried to call  about a couple days ago my sister just showed me the uh the miley cyrus video for that song the  party of the usa thing yeah it is it should be illegal i thought anthony would really really like  it well cue that up dan it's basically like a 16 year old uh uh chick with her uh she's basically  dancing around in her underwear i thought you would really really like oh well you thought correct 
[01:11:30]  sir and maybe you could invite her over and hide her in your closet and miley's one of these disney  girls right not anymore really yeah she's who she works for now corporate wise i mean she's doing her  own thing she's got some record label behind her her father jesus her fucking well cut off shorts are  right up to the where the the lips start that's what i'm talking about and and she walks around like  she's early 20s but how old is she now i mean maybe 16 17 yeah she's probably around 17. yeah 
[01:12:00]  she's fine now totally legal in new york well she works for the same parent company as steve phillips  so you know it's all good it's all good look at that yeah she's got a little fucking she's all right  on us fuck i didn't mean to do that but i thought you were done wow all right why don't we go to the  first yankee song trying to become the song tic tac and the freak show was playing this yesterday  afternoon who the fuck are they tic tac and a freak show tic tac and who the fuck is tic tac 
[01:12:30]  and that's the afternoon you know i'm noticing something you can't call yourself the freak show  when regular radio won't let you do anything yeah how freaky are they yeah what is he what's the  freakiest freak show gets well the big advertisement yesterday the big uh texting thing because they  always want you 92 3 now is all about having you text them if you text tic tac and the freak show  yesterday he'll text you back with the link of how you can listen to this song 
[01:13:00]  after they played it sam i'm trying to be a better listener for real okay i i i don't know what  happened it's no i'm not even trying to make a joke okay what did you what did you just try to say  well tic tac and the freak show right i still have you right i yeah i understand that part okay  i don't have you and and i asked you the freak show what does he do that's freaky that his name  is freak show and this and you're giving me an example right big promotion yesterday was  since they were hyping up this faux nastas yankees song okay he said he's all he wants people to text 
[01:13:30]  him that station is all about the texting well they're trying to they're trying to be all involved  with new media right then in their an asshole in their powerpoint shows they could say we got ten  thousand texts last week yeah i know um yes but uh advertise if you're if new media it doesn't  matter if you're still if your product is just right exactly it doesn't matter but so he said the big  thing was if you text tic tac he'll text you back with a link of where you can go to listen to the song 
[01:14:00]  that they're playing on the radio on your computer and that's what that would be the incentive to text  i saw i saw opie get lost again near the end actually so yeah near the end the incentive to  text so you can listen on the computer to the song that you listen to on the radio seems like too much  work but why doesn't the fucking tic tac freak show guy is it the same guy tic tac and the freak show  so his first name is tic tac his last name is the freak show no no no his name is tic tac and he is 
[01:14:30]  presenting the freak show who's the freak show so people is it well it's tic tac it is right yeah  i see that's why i was making his interns i mean i yeah so he doesn't even really have an actual  freak show no he doesn't have much of a cast of characters there's not a huge budget for the freak  show and by the way uh tic tac is holding it down by the way coke logic writes 92.3 now only has 531  more followers than me and they're a radio station in a major market well not a major market actually it 
[01:15:00]  would be the number one number the major market yes yes yeah all right that's wonderful sam so here's the  song here comes uh here come the yankees by pho nasus it's not technically it sounds like a rip off  of jay-z's run this town to me but it's not technically a parody song it's not is that uh the  song where he's got a hundred problems but the bitch ain't one oh you're thinking of 99 problems oh 99  problems but the is that billy joel song he redid no that is he didn't do a billy joel song he did a 
[01:15:30]  song called empire state of mind oh i thought it was we didn't start the motherfucking fire  no none of these songs that you just listed had anything to do with this pho nasus song okay yeah  did uh jay-z ever pay little little annie hall or not annie hall fucking little annie for that  fucking rip off in that other song there's no rip off if he's not like yeah the hard he sampled hard  knock life and i'm sure whoever owns the rights to that music was paid in full they got paid i'm sure  what about little annie did she get a little piece i don't know because that was a big hit 
[01:16:00]  song for jay-z i don't know if annie will annie get a little piece so she can buy her little lugs  she probably did not own the rights to the music and therefore would not be  part of the profit jay-z's a rip-off artist he's not a rip-off artist because i heard 99  problems with the bitch ain't one was done by somebody else too the title is the same of what  another rap song it's redoing how is he getting paid to just just play the annie song he's not he's he's  sampling it no i hear this isn't a sample this is annie listen i guess that's supposed to make 
[01:16:30]  it better no because in annie it was never that uh it wasn't no there's no baseline there's no  baseline he got he got paid big because he gets out of the uh it sounds like vanilla ice explaining  how his rip was different than clean yeah because vanilla ice actually ripped that off and didn't pay  anybody jay-z paid to sample now because he said it i mean jay-z would have been under serious 
[01:17:00]  lawsuits why does he have to rip off the annie song when he could just come up with a uh an original  song he's supposed to come up with many original not a big fan of the sample there sam why that's  how hip-hop started that's more than a sample hip-hop started with rapping over other people's records  example is taking a beat from something that this is the whole song it's just the hook a lot of look  a lot of old artists that never got uh a lot of money are getting fucking ripped off these days 
[01:17:30]  because they don't own their rights to their music that's their problem i think there's a tainted love  one now right oh yeah see they're just using the rip from tainted love just that one little part  which is the entire hook for the song yeah that's right they sampled the hook the sun will come out  tomorrow but your bottom dollar that tomorrow come what may tomorrow tomorrow that would be  a good sample it was tomorrow so they couldn't do it because it's only a day away like that's that's  like using that he also sampled uh i'd do anything from oliver really that's that's a lesser known 
[01:18:00]  song but it's really good too much jay-z fo all right we gave you your time thank you enough with  you and your dumb jay-z thing uh 90 so there so our old station which is what is our old station now  nine two three exactly oh really oh yes what'd i do correct our old station is now now nine two  three now here's their yankee song they're trying to shove down their listeners trots  here come the yankees  i don't know what they're saying you're about to miss a really good line my favorite i don't know 
[01:18:30]  what they're saying it's very hard to understand feeling hip hip what would you say generally i 
[01:19:00]  would hooray hip hip jorge have you heard this song oh my god don't worry  i don't know what they're saying  i don't know what they're saying  Melky Cabrera, you know it's over once they say, Mariano Rivera, word is bombed, drop the name, bombed, that's an A-bomb, from A-Rod.  Do you hear the rumble in the box, cause the whole wide world is making, time to show them that they're not alone, they're not alone, cheering sounds come from the crowd, nothing left to stop you now. 
[01:19:30]  Just remember we're behind you, make noise for the Yankees, the Yankees, the Yankees, the Yankees, the Yankees, the Yankees, the Yankees, the Yankees. 
[01:20:00]  Oh my dear, sweet Jesus Christ. 
[01:20:30]  Make noise for the Yankees.  What happened to white music?  Corny was gone.  You know, that's it for that one, Sam.  You're not going to?  That's it?  Yeah, that's it for that one.  How about the stadium next to me was sold to you?  All right.  What?  Anthony.  What?  You're going to carry it away.  I think that would be a good one.  Oh, they ripped off You Spin Me Around.  That's a big hit song now.  They didn't rip at all. 
[01:21:00]  It was sampled.  No, it's a rip-off, man.  No, they're...  If you're supposedly an artist, you know, you could, like, come up with some new shit.  But they do come up with new stuff, and then they also take old stuff...  It's not really coming up with new stuff when they're using the basic riff of a really popular song.  But they're bringing it to a new audience, a new generation of people who will now appreciate it.  Most of the people have no idea that the You Spin Me Around song was, you know...  You spin me right round, baby, round, round, like a...  Round, round, round. 
[01:21:30]  They're not into that nonsense.  Do we have that song?  You tell me that people who are listening to this song know that it's from an old song.  They don't know.  So I think Meat Spin...  Meat Spin me around, round, round, round.  Meat Spin me around.  Well, that's a song that plays when you go there.  Oh, does it?  Why wouldn't it?  Yeah, you know, you guys should talk about this with Patrice.  Patrice knows so many hip-hop songs that have been sampled, and stuff that you thought was original turns out to be old school. 
[01:22:00]  He blew my mind when he was doing that.  Yeah, he really knows what I'm about.  Oh, yeah.  He did the one, uh, you, you got what I need.  Yeah, but even, even...  Yeah, wait.  So much other stuff, man.  It's like every classic rap song has been sampled.  Why does every fucking, like, song...  Just like those two songs we just listened to about the Phillies and the Yankees...  The Yankees.  It's all gotta be some bad fucking hip-hop R&B shit with some caterwauling bitch in the background going through vocal aerobics. 
[01:22:30]  Shut it!  The kids are listening to.  Nah, fuck that.  Kids are listening to that.  Wiggers, they call them.  They call them fucking wiggers.  No.  Yes, they do.  No, not anymore.  Nah, fuck me running.  They've all assimilated now.  Fuck that.  The children, you mean.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's, uh...  No, it's exactly what I mean.  I wasn't making a statement.  They're all into hip-hop.  Oh.  Uh, Kristen Smithtown writes, definitely not as good as Vinny and the Jets. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, that one.  That's an old listener right there.  Vinny and the Jets.  Vinny, Vinny, Vinny and the Jets.  Well, nothing ever beat Let's Go, Metz Go.  Well, that was a terrific one.  That was terrific.  Let's Go, Metz Go.  Uh, Larry King wants in.  Uh, Larry.  Hey, guys.  How important is, uh, being able to understand the lyrics?  Yeah, that's...  I mean, as long as you can understand the hook, you get the message. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, it's not that I'm an old curmudgeon.  And I've always hated fucking hip-hop.  I hate it!  Get with it.  No!  You don't like a little Biggie?  I hated hip-hop when I was fucking...  Biggie, Biggie, Biggie.  The only hip-hop I ever liked...  The only hip-hop I ever liked was fucking, uh, NWA, Eazy-E, fucking Ghetto Boys, because  the shit was funny to listen to.  You know, NWA...  They just talked about smacking hoes and fucking, uh, uh, fuck the police and drugs.  They did their share of sampling. 
[01:24:00]  And fuck...  Well, yeah.  But you know what?  Respect yourself?  It was funny to fucking listen to.  See, what the point we're trying to make, Sam, there was a time where these artists took  a sample, but it was very slight.  You know, Eazy-E...  And added a little bit to the song.  Now they're taking the entire fucking, uh, song.  But that's the way it started.  Eazy-E was cruising down the street in his 6'4", uh, jocking the bitches and smacking  the whores.  That's correct.  Whores, actually, but...  The whores.  Whores.  That's what he was doing.  Can we hear a little Biggie? 
[01:24:30]  You got a little Biggie for everybody?  Biggie.  Yeah.  You don't like the Biggie?  You gotta like Biggie.  Biggie fucking rules.  No, I don't like Biggie.  Biggie Smalls make you shit your drawers.  That's right.  Fucking Biggie.  No, I don't like Biggie.  That fucking Biggie will get the job done.  I don't like fucking Tupac.  You don't like Tupac?  What about California?  No, that shit blows.  Incorrect.  All right, why don't we get back to the, uh, the baseball song.  Correct.  Jocktober, we're featuring Bad Radio in New York and Philly as they have baseball fever. 
[01:25:00]  Now we got another, uh, Philly song from the same dumb station, Q102, down there in Philly.  Uh, you know that song, um, I got a feeling.  Black Eyed Peas.  Tonight's gonna be a good night.  All right.  You know.  Do you know that pop song?  I fucking, whatever.  Why are you so unhappy?  I hate fucking this shit.  You don't hear pop music just here and there?  I do.  You gotta know this one.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Kinda gets you, kinda gets you pumped for, for a new day.  Yeah.  Cause you hear it starts building, then the hook comes in and it really starts going.  You should play this every morning, getting ready for that job.  This could be the new intro.  Do I hear an auto-turner?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Oh, wow.  Go figure that out.  Wait for it to kick in.  Yeah, it's gonna be good.  You're gonna like it.  Does Fergie kick it in? 
[01:26:00]  Uh, no.  She comes in a little later.  Kicks it in with her giant toes.  Look at that build.  It's building.  Yeah.  Like, oh my God.  It's no ting-ting.  There's Fergie. 
[01:26:30]  Fergie.  I remember that.  So that's the song that Q102 did another Philly song to.  So, Anthony, they changed the Black Eyed Peas, I Got a Feeling, into, are you ready for  this?  Uh-oh.  I Got a Feeling.  Oh.  So they didn't change the title.  Ah, but they did, my friend.  They did.  They spell feeling P-H-E-E-L-I-N-G.  Yes.  Oh.  Like the Phillies.  Like the Phillies.  Is it the same song?  No, no.  All right.  Very different. 
[01:27:00]  We got a feeling.  That this year's gonna be a good year.  That this year's gonna be a good year.  Yeah.  That this year's gonna be a repeat year.  The Phillies.  Woo-hoo.  2009's gonna be a good year.  Yeah, 0-9's gonna be a good year.  Yeah, 0-9's gonna be on repeat here 
[01:27:30]  This year's our year  Let's live it up  Philzips are winning  Can't get enough  Go out and smash it  Like oh my god  Jump off that sofa  It's the play  Off  It's the play  On  Mazel to  When they are hitting  They just go  Off  Let's paint the town  Red all around  Last year we rules  We're gonna win it again 
[01:28:00]  Let's do it  Let's do it  Let's do it  Let's do it  Let's do it  And do it  Let's win again  And do it  And do it  Do it  Do it  Let's do it  Let's do it  Let's do it  Let's repeat the feeling  Woo  Cause this year's gonna be a good year  Yes, this year's gonna be a good year  Yes, this year's gonna be a repeat year 
[01:28:30]  The Phillies  This year's our year  I gotta turn it off, Sam  That's it?  Yeah, that's plenty  That's plenty  Goes on for another three years  Cause they won last year  That's plenty for everybody  Repeat year, right  Let's win it again  Let's win it again  To Mac in Atlanta  Mac  Hey Mac  What's up Mac?  Yeah, I wanted to ask Anthony  I mean  When did he switch from beer to Haterade?  What is it?  Oh shit  You did  Damn, I'm drinking Haterade  I thought that bottle said Gatorade  I was wrong  There's a G on here 
[01:29:00]  It's not an H  There'd be a big H on my bottle  With a lightning bolt through it  Somebody must have replaced it  With some Haterade then  Haterade  You seem a bit on edge today  You alright there?  I  What's wrong?  I can't stand  This shit  There is just  It's  It's shit  Haterade is right  That caller was right on the money  This guy wants to add to that song we just heard  Dano in Kentucky  Morning fellas  Hey Dano  Hey guys  I got a feeling this chill's going to be a douche chill 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, I got a feeling  Let me go to Scott on Long Island  Scott  Hey boys, what's going on?  Hey man  Listen to that  This is going to be a good year  So I'm going to actually just throw up in my mouth  Oh no  He's vomiting  It's the song that's making people vomit  I hope everyone's okay out there  Hey Danny  What was that Biggie Smalls thing?  It's one of my favorite Biggie Smalls lines of all time  You like Biggie Smalls?  No  You don't like Biggie Smalls?  Come on  I'm not into the 
[01:30:00]  It's P-I-G  My hip hop roots are like stuck in the early 90s  I never got away from that stuff  But I thought this was one of the best lines I've ever heard a rap artist have  It's I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks  I gotta sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets  See there's nothing that creative in white people music  I think Jarvis has the actual  I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks  Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets  It's just a great line 
[01:30:30]  Come on  How can he not like Biggie?  Conjures up a lovely image doesn't it?  How can he not like the Biggie?  Alright we move back to New York  He's shaking his pants a lot  It's October  Bad radio in New York and Philly  There's a lot of Vanessa sheets  I know  I know  They have baseball fever  We go to Z100  Yeah  Rip down his balls anyway and get on his sheets  If his techniques are dripping out his butt cheeks  I think gravity would take its toll  And it would drip down his nutsack and drip onto his sheets anyway 
[01:31:00]  He's alright with a few droplets  Are you speaking from a personal experience?  Someone that you know maybe  It could be that techniques could drip out your butt cheeks  Even if you're on your stomach  He don't mind a few droplets  He just doesn't want that big ass fucking noise  He doesn't want like all techniques all over  Exactly  He understands he's going to get a little techniques  He just doesn't want a lot of techniques  Alright  All over  Z100  What have they been up to lately Sam?  Well  Another great regular radio station  Yeah  Elvis Duran is still rock and rolling in the mornings 
[01:31:30]  Is he really?  He's making a lot of money  They're really syndicating his show out there  And every station that he's on  Like in Philly I think he's on a station  He's on all over the place  And he's advertised  What does he do that?  He's on all over the place  He plays some songs  And phone  Prank phone calls  I mean it's not a thing  You're not allowed to do prank phone calls  No  Fake prank phone calls  So if you hear prank phone calls  On regular radio  Please know that they're not allowed to do that anymore  And it's all set up  In fact  Like every station that he's on  The station on their website 
[01:32:00]  Advertises it as if  It's their exclusive morning show  Like Philly's Elvis Duran  Or Cleveland's Elvis Duran  And it's like  It's not  But yeah  They have a Yankee song  Apparently  This song is getting played  In the stadium  But that's not going to stop us  From herbing them up  Well of course  Wait this is being played  At Yankee Stadium?  That's what  So this has got to be really good  You would think  The Yankees wouldn't let shit 
[01:32:30]  In their stadium  Well  Is it?  How you doing?  Made it to the Yankee Stadium  So  This is done to the Jay-Z song  Run This Town  Featuring Kanye West and Rihanna  Of course  Featuring who?  Kanye West and Rihanna?  Who's Kanye?  Kanye West  I think you know who he is  He's a very famous  Rapper producer  Oh yeah  He's done a lot  I mean a lot  Of songs  Both hits  That he's produced  And rapped on  I know Rihanna got beat up  Well I mean  She's also had a lot of hits 
[01:33:00]  She got beat up by  An Umbrella or something  No  That was her hit song  Oh  She got beat up by Chris Brown  But she has a new song out  Called Russian Roulette  You know what?  I was reading about Chris Brown  Today in the paper  Getting a little knowledge  And he's really pissed at Oprah  Why is that?  Because he went on Oprah  And Oprah gave her the fucking  You know what  The  What is it?  What degree?  Ninth?  Fifth?  Fifth?  Third degree?  Third degree  Let's go with  Because third degree burns  Are pretty bad  So I'm going to go  With the third degree  Alright  You give him the third degree  So Oprah gave him 
[01:33:30]  The third degree  On the whole Rihanna thing  And he couldn't believe it  Because they've done  Some charity shit  Together in Africa  Like Chris Brown  Helped her with  The African school thing  Or something  So he's all pissed off  At Oprah  That Oprah didn't understand  Why would Oprah understand?  Of course Oprah  Took the angle  She should have taken  Yeah  Yeah and I think  Oprah wins  Whoever's battling Oprah  Oprah wins  He actually chipped in  On Oprah's rape school  Okay  Well I don't think  It was set up to be that  It turned out  I don't think they set it up 
[01:34:00]  To be an actual rape school  They didn't set it up to rape school?  No  They did not  I don't think it was called  Oprah's rape school  Oh  Because they had a problem  With admissions  I would think  To start with  Okay  My mistake  Yeah  Alright well  Q10  Z100  Oh they're the same  Fucking station  Nah  Z100  Z100  And keep in mind  We're right in the middle  Of the 92-3 now  Z100 rivalry  That's heating up  New York City  Why are you yawning at that? 
[01:34:30]  Because it's just  Incomprehensible  This whole thing  I can't take  All of these songs  Well let's do  Z100's  Yankees  Run this town  That's right  Key pride is in the air  Hear fans  Screams from everywhere  We're addicted  To the thrill  I'm ready  And some baseball  Love affair  Mess with them  You're going down  Got a problem  Tell me now  Postseason 
[01:35:00]  It's Yankees time  They gonna run  This town tonight  Yankees gonna run  This town tonight  Her voice is average  At best  But I'm okay  With the song  So far  And the only reason  I stop it  Because I know  They're just gonna ruin it  With a lot of nonsense  That's not Rihanna  Is the nonsense  Coming up?  There's some  Rapping  And Danny  Did you say  Rihanna had a lot  Of hits too?  I did  Sam did  Yeah  She had a ton of hits 
[01:35:30]  Oh but that's not  The joke  No no no  See it would be  A double entendre thing  She had a lot of hits  Hits  Yeah  No I meant songs  Then it would be funny  Oh you meant songs?  Yeah  I meant like  I was just being factual  Why would you be factual  When there's a joke there?  I wanted to make sure  Everybody was informed  And you should have  Then said yeah  I said that  Because I meant  You know  Once you got hit a lot  No I didn't mean that  Oh he's just a little punchable  Yankees  Who's gonna run this town?  Yankees song  Yeah I said the Yankees song  It's Bomber Nation 
[01:36:00]  Let your elite town  It's all pinstripe songs  Pinstripe everything  Stripe hats  Stripe shirts  Pinstripe everything  All our fans are diehards  All across America  Gotta show respect  Games and stuff  Legends are made up  They got a lot familiar  Raymond and Posada  Matt, Sui, Kno, Burn, Net, and Jop  Been a couple of years down  Now the Yankees are back  As American as Apple Pie  Cracker Jacks  Yeah I'm talking Babe Ruth  To Joe D  The Yankee Clipper  Now we got the greatest  Closer ever 
[01:36:30]  Rip Ferra  Hell yeah  Winning games like it's not fair  The Yankees are so good  Clipper and Rivera  Clipper  The Yankees are so good  Time to pop some more champagne  So  Pop more champagne  Can we turn this off now Sam  Well I feel like you haven't got  Give me a fair shot  Alright  It's a lot of noise  Let's music  Runnin' down the night  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey 
[01:37:00]  What's he doing in the background?  I love when they add in the players names  They got just the best  And you guys are making fun of Let's Go Metz Go  Come on  I'd rather hear that at this point  You didn't like that song?  It just gets too like noisy  There's too much stuff going on  It just goes to show you what a producer really does 
[01:37:30]  To rap songs  Because  These stink  You can't understand a word they're saying  It's all fucking just  Just  I mean these aren't professional rappers either  Talking over each other  Steven S wants to know  Who the fuck is Babe Roof?  Did they really say Babe Roof?  I mean that  That's poetic license  Babe Roof  Babe Roof  There's no roof on Yankee Stadium 
[01:38:00]  No there is not a roof on Yankee Stadium  Babe Roof  That's poetic license  You're allowed to change words a little bit  But when you go for a fucking job interview  You can't say I like Babe Roof  You're not going to get the job  That's true  Who the fuck is that?  That's a Babe Roof  Oh Babe on a Roof  There's two girls  Hot Babes sunbathing on the roof  Topless on a roof  That's Babe Roof  That's a Babe Roof for ya  Looking very nice  Alright finally we go to Scott and Todd 
[01:38:30]  What the fuck have these two been up to since we last talked?  Well we haven't talked about Scott and Todd in like a year  So I figured that they're doing some better stuff now  Yeah  And Ant you wanted to hear like some white people parodies  White people music yes  And thank God Todd Pettengale is around for you to give you some white person music parodies  He is white  The biggest hack  You think so?  In all of morning zoos  He used to host WWF Mania 
[01:39:00]  Yeah  Where did that get him?  I mean he's back on the same morning show where he started  Exactly  In the exact same spot except now he's not on TV anymore  And he's still doing the show with Rocky Dennis  No that's Scott  Huh?  Shannon  Rocky Dennis  I love when the blind girl touched Scott Shannon's face  Yeah  You guys are getting the two confused  That was great  Well a guy shouldn't be getting fucking plastic surgery  Most people shouldn't be getting fucking plastic surgery  He was supposed to go on a motorcycle tour of Europe with Todd 
[01:39:30]  Really?  Yeah and then Todd said he couldn't make it  And he pulled the pins out of the map and started crying  And then he went to sleep and died  No I just heard him on the air yesterday  Oh really?  Yeah  Oh I think you're confused with somebody else  Sorry  And when you smile your eyes are supposed to close a little bit  They don't  Well everybody's built differently  They don't with this Scott Shannon  It's creepy  His eyes are wide open  Wide open and he smiles at the same time  Alright  You want to hear their white boy song? 
[01:40:00]  This will end this dumb bit  Let's go Yanks to the tune of Bon Jovi's It's My Life  See Bon Jovi  Now that is a white artist  Who's singing Todd?  Who do you think?  Who always sings these?  Oh God  Mr. TP Todd Pettengale  Proving  He's about to prove  I swear to you  I haven't heard this song yet  I'm confident enough to say  He's about to prove  Why he's the biggest fucking hack  In Morning Zoo Radio  Watch it  Scott and Todd is the longest running  Continuous  New York radio  He's the king of something that Anthony brought to the table 
[01:40:30]  The shoehorning of lyrics  Shoehorn it in  Meaning you push a little too many syllables  In your song parody  Yeah and you put the accent on the wrong syllable  So it fits in  That's basic shoehorning  Here we go  Let's go Yanks to the tune of Bon Jovi's It's My Life  He's done it again  It's time to finish what they started 
[01:41:00]  Oh  Oh my god  What's wrong?  What's  What?  Top hang  We should cut our losses and just stop right here  You know that right?  You think so?  Yes  Why don't we finish what we started  Here's something  When you're doing a song parody  You should sound like the original artist  Let's start there  At least a little bit  Oh  That sounded nothing like Bon Jovi  Oh rumors about Shane McMahon speaking of wrestling 
[01:41:30]  What's the rumors?  MMA?  Oh he's very much into MMA and boxing  Very much  So there's two angles  Shane McMahon would not just leave the WWE  Something's going on  Of course  And something big is going on  Now there's a couple of ways this could go  I think Vince has been interested in the MMA a little bit too  Does he start another company with Shane as the main guy?  Because Shane ain't going to do it without his dad  Or has Shane said fuck my dad I'm doing this on my own  I doubt that Vince McMahon would start an MMA company 
[01:42:00]  He might help Shane fund one  Fund one  So he'll be a silent partner  Yeah it sounded more like that  And for Vince to be a silent partner  See Shane  Shane doesn't want to wait around for his old man to retire  Right  And become the next wrestling guy  And he could  When he could start something now  Because Shane McMahon's been on our show a lot  He's a fucking smart dude  Yeah  He ain't just leaving the WWE because he's bored  And he's been  I mean because he's  What was the word?  Bored is maybe accurate  Oh yeah  Gay?  No  Oh sorry 
[01:42:30]  I just threw that in  Yeah but he's been  I think he's a family man  Of course he is  No I think  I bet you it's an MMA thing  He's been trying to get boxing and MMA involved with WWE in various ways for years  Like he got Floyd Mayweather involved in all that stuff  So he's a big boxing MMA guy  Very interesting  We'll be following that closely  Alright back to  What's his name Todd?  Todd Pengale  Todd doing a horrendous version  I don't like  A horrendous imitation of Bon  John Bon Jovi 
[01:43:00]  He's done it again  It's time to finish what they started  Wisher to the Colts  Wanky swiped first  Gonna leave the Angels broken hearted  12th pitch 7th inning for Sabathia  Man the Bronx was rocking  It was wicked loud  Gonna take it to the series for the hometown crowd  It's all night 
[01:43:30]  In mid-October  We won't be happy till  Okay what happened?  A perfect example of the shoehorning by the way  He added a million syllables to October and  And I think night  It's now or never  Doesn't work with mid-October  Listen again  It's all night  In mid-October  We won't be happy till it's over 
[01:44:00]  And we have another flag to fly  Let's go Yanks  A-Rod's staring off the baseball  And she is going into the hole  But first the Yankees have to win it all  Let's go Yanks  Ball game over  Yankees win 
[01:44:30]  The Yankees win  Gonna beat the team named after heaven  Just another ho-ho winning for Sabathia  On their way to lucky 27  That's hitting the air right  Jeter makes it 2-0  Time to get this ALCS done  They got a magic number  And it's down to one  It's all night 
[01:45:00]  In mid-October  Already?  I can't take that  We won't be happy till it's over  And we have another flag to fly  Let's go Yanks  Never all behind your eyes  What happened?  Danny passed gas  I'd rather hear that  That song made Danny far  Quick sample that  And make a song out of it  Give it to a rap artist 
[01:45:30]  He'll do something with that, Sam  That's horrendous  He stinks  Why are they doing this?  This guy sucks  And I thought you were a Yankees fan  Why would they do this?  There's your white boy song  You said there's not enough white boy songs  Well, perhaps I can say I was absolutely wrong  I think that was the worst one right there  That's why I stayed there for the end  That's Scott and Todd  And why is Todd frosting his hair?  What's that about?  Stay young  Stay looking hip  Keep the girls interested  He's a middle-aged man frosting his hair 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, the girls don't know that  They look at the head of hair  And say, man, look at this young go-go  He's frosting his hair  And then fucking  Who knows what Scott's doing to his face  I would assume it's Botox or something  Well, that's how they keep the young demo  You know?  All the kids are listening to Scott and Todd  No doubt about it  Scott has a frozen face  And Todd is frosting his hair  Yeah, man  Ugh  It's cool  It's 2001  People are still doing that, you know?  2001?  Is it not?  Oh  Is that when people were frosting their hair? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah  That was the big year for  Yeah, it was about 2001  The hair frosting  Yeah  All right  I don't even know what to say about that one  That was so bad  You can't even  I don't know  No, no  That's just awful  Well, the thing is  I recorded a whole Scott and Todd show  And like  You'd think like on this show  If one of us did a song parody  You'd play it once  Maybe twice  Yeah  Later in the show  And you know, that's it  Because you have so much stuff to get to  This song was played at least three times in a single hour  No way 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, this song that you just heard  That you could not even play once  Because you felt it was so bad  For the medium of radio  That it would be harmful to your listener base  They played three times in one hour  That's how  Because they feel like  You know, when they play  A Miley Cyrus song or something like that  They put it in heavy rotation  And that's what makes it popular  Yeah  But with a parody song  Not so much  They don't put these songs on their website either  Because they think people  Probably want to steal them 
[01:47:30]  What, they're going to try to make money off that more shit?  Other radio shows might want to  Latch on to the Scott and Todd parody songs  Yeah  Oh  Do they put the call letters in the middle of the song  So they can't fucking burn it from the  From the radio?  Not if you just record their radio stream  Oh, I've heard of those, yeah  Z100 was doing that to that Yankee song on their website  What?  Putting the Z100 on it  That's why I had to  No one's going to fucking  They're delusional  Oh, other radio shows will steal it and  They're delusional 
[01:48:00]  Why would you steal that?  They say that that song is played in Yankee Stadium  That Z100 parody song  That's what they say  Well, there you go  There's your Jocktober for today  A little different take on the whole thing  Yeah  Rather listen to a hole and a guy  That sound like they're married or something  I actually found a show like that  We could highlight on Monday  Oh, you did?  Yeah  Really?  Yeah, it's like a girl and a guy  You'd think they were married  What city are we going to?  I don't know  I mean, it's the last week of Jocktober next week  Boo  You have Let's Go, Metzgo? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, I want to hear a little Let's Go  This actually sounds good  After listening to the rest of that crap  This is so bad  Rock  Yes, the pendulum is swinging back  Yeah  That's pretty good  That's that fucking  Let's go  Air band  Sound to it  I like when they talk about players  Let's go 
[01:49:00]  Do it  Do it, do it  Let's go, let's go  We got the teamwork  To make a dream work  See, this is white people music  Let's go, let's go  So corny  This is a song they would play  For a montage  Yeah  In the late 80s  A movie  This could be in Scarface  All right, we get the point  No one is immune to the bad sports song  We're going to take a break 
[01:49:30]  Patrice O'Neal is sitting outside that studio  Let's go  Let's get him involved with the program  We'll break and we'll continue  You got that Norton thing?  I think we're going to break with that Norton thing  Don't forget, Norton's playing Buffalo tonight  I'm not sure if both shows are sold out  I really don't know  I'm sure we'll have info  Somewhere on this channel today  If they're not, they will be  That's right, Sam  Good job  And we'll continue  Stay there  We're back  Opie and Anthony  Full house today  Going around the room  We got Patrice O'Neal

[01:52:00]  I'm going to be so nervous with a stomach ache  You feeling right, Joe?  Yeah, I feel pretty good  You're right?  Oh, Jesus  He doesn't want to say good  Because he's just scared  You're pretty good  You're right, Joe?  It's karma  You know what kills me, motherfuckers?  Like, Joe?  I think Joe's an atheist, right?  Aren't you an atheist, Joe?  Yeah  See, I love when atheists get sick  Now it's like  He's trying to have karma  And he's like  I feel okay  Hoping that God's going to fucking fix it  It's great to be an atheist until you get sick  Exactly  Oh, fuck  Or the plane's going down

[02:01:00]  How many beers  I was drinking  Four or five nights a week  And completely shit face  So you know  That's a lot of calories right  You know  What the fuck  Liquor doesn't make you  Oh yeah  Are you kidding me  Beer is so many calories  Beer makes your stomach fatter right  My stomach's gone down  But you don't have a beer belly  I did  My stomach's going way down dude  That's like great for my stomach man  Don't fucking make that face at me  As I watch your medallion  Sit on top of that fucking shelf  You got coming out of the middle  Of your body  It looks like they're on display 
[02:01:30]  His medallion just shit  But here's my thing  I'd like to see that  I'm consistently  I'm a consistent fat man  This is what bothers me  Is  Is a guy that can pretend  That he's in shape  Like when I walked in  You don't go  Hey Patrice  You're looking terrible  Yeah I am  You lost a couple of pounds  Honestly we've never thought that  You just come in  It's just Patrice  You go slow  Right  Joe's on some three weeks  I don't drink diet  Where people go  You don't look good 
[02:02:00]  You're supposed to look better  If you stop drinking  Coming in looking like  A funny zombie  Did you see a paranormal activity  My friend  Not yet  Nah  You liked  How was that  It sucked  Blow it up  If you don't think it's good  Everyone's talking about  How great this thing is  It was made for what 
[02:02:30]  Eight hundred dollars  Or something  It looked like  Two things  Eleven to eleven thousand bucks  I'm fed up with home camera movies  And  Really  It's done  I'm done with them  And secondly  The movie should have been called  Go get the number  To Y-Curt Realty  So we can sell this fucking house  That this demon is in  Oh really  Is that it  This fucking  It's  This movie made me sick  Blair Witch Project 2012  But  The Jamie Foxx movie 
[02:03:00]  We were talking about  Saw that  Great movie  Wait let's  Hold on  Slow down with the  Let's go back to Paranormal  Because everyone's going to  Try to see that movie  Go see it  But what  You just hated it  Why  The same way I hated  Blair Witch Project  I wanted to take a shit  Right in the theater  People think Blair Witch Project  Was the fucking shit  Did you  I hated that fucking movie  I'll be completely honest  Are you ready for this one  I never saw the movie  Why  I don't know  You didn't miss nothing  I've never seen that movie  It sucks  That's one I've never seen  Nothing scary about  Paranormal Activity  I rewinded it 
[02:03:30]  Six or seven times  You're not supposed to be  Rewinding because you're not  Oh I mean  I  I went into four or five  Different theaters  Maybe  Maybe you hated it  Because your copies sucked  People were talking  Through the whole movie  Maybe that's why  Maybe  Maybe you got a bad copy  So you  You  It wasn't scary  Because some of the scenes  Kind of looked like 
[02:04:00]  Oh that would make me jump  Yeah what's that weird  Shadowy thing that comes  Flying at the camera  That looked like  You could scare some people  You didn't jump  You don't jump at movies  At all do you  Do you jump at scary movies  What do you find  What do you consider  Scary movies  Fair enough  I never was afraid of supernatural  Supernatural anything  Yeah  So that's one thing  So maybe I'm just not the right guy  Supernatural  I'm afraid of  Of  Real shit that could happen to you  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
[02:04:30]  The original  Yeah  When the girl comes out  Or when the guy falls in  And this nigga just has a hammer  Yeah  And he snorts  And hits him in the head  And hangs him on a hook  Yeah  Or the bitch comes out  The fucking  The bitch comes out  The room  Yeah  And he opens that door  That butchered closet  With the iron door  And he's squealing  And she runs  And that fucker chases her  Yeah  And grabs him  Before she gets out the house  And then hangs her on a hook  And beats her in the head  And puts her in the fucking freezer  That  That  Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
[02:05:00]  Is one of the scariest movies  I've ever seen  That doesn't scare me  That like  Kind of  Kind of slasher  Fucking shit  That's beyond  That's better than a slasher movie  Yeah I understand  Cause there's like  Real thriller shit  Oh it's just  And like psychologically  Fucked up shit  But  For me to jump  Like shit like  The ring  Fuck me up  That  The ring I laugh at  See no  Any of that  Weird  Scary children  Make me laugh 
[02:05:30]  No see now  It's easy to say  Scary children make you laugh  Cause now it's been overplayed  But when that shit  First happened  You're like  What the fuck  No the exorcists are scary  And the ring was fucking scary  That's the problem though  With most horror movies now  Is what you're talking about  Jumping  They're all like  They all rely on these  Knee jerk scares  You know what I mean  Like that's the beauty of  Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Or the exorcist  They create this mood  From the first frame  Of Texas Chainsaw Massacre  You're just like  What the fuck is going on  I don't feel right  This is weird  You know what I mean  That's a good way to put it  But like the ring  It's just normal  Normal 
[02:06:00]  Normal  They do those  Those violin screeches  You know  The exorcist  The one scene  That bothered me  Is the  Is the one they added  Later  In the  Oh it's just  The spider walk  That's creepy  That creeps me  That kind of shit  That made me laugh  When there's someone  All fucked up  Walking on the ceiling  All fucking weird  That shit I can't look at  It freaks me out  And know what she did  I guess the exorcist  Is kind of fucked up  It's fucking scary  And know what she did  You're cutting data  That shit is fucking 
[02:06:30]  Picks the blood  Into the camera  Dude  That's alright  That's scary  It was such a great  Fucking scene  Why didn't they put it  In the original  They said  They said they cut it  Out of the original  Because they thought  It was too scary  Too soon  They wanted you  To wait longer  To get to the creepy shit  Yeah  That's why they wanted  To piss on the rock first  And he said  He didn't want you  To think she could  Get out of the room  He said he thought  It was scary  If she was up  But how scary  Is that fucking premise  It's your daughter  You can't leave the house  And this thing  Is just living up  In that room 
[02:07:00]  Above you  The whole time  Oh it's so fucking scary  Maybe I saw the exorcist  I think I saw the exorcist  Like six  Like twenty years  Too late  Yeah  Like twenty years too late  Like my mother  Learned how to paint  After the exorcist  Like she couldn't sleep  She started  Really  Yeah after she saw it  She couldn't sleep  So she was up all night  Just painting  Yeah I fucked people up  The exorcist  It was shocking  I can't watch it alone  It freaks me out  Still?  Yeah I can't watch it by myself  When she sticks the cross  In her pussy  It's like oh my god  Hot right? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah  Yeah  But I just don't believe  I just don't believe  I just don't believe  In paranormal shit  See that shit gets me  All the time  The paranormal stuff  Cause if I ever saw  Like a fucking ghost  Or anything like that  And not like a  Boo sheets over him  Ghost  You know  Like a real  Fucking ghostly thing  I'd shit myself  I would fucking  Shit my pants  And be like  So ghost  Dude let's  That scares the piss  Out of me  Let's spend the night  In an old prison  Or something  Let's go to some  Fucking haunted place

[02:18:00]  Fucking  That is really funny  That is funny  I will say this  Making fun of all the  Fucking ghost videos  Online  Very good  Last year  I did comments  Come home  Yeah  I  No bullshit  Yeah  Did comments  Come home  Stayed in the  Liberty Hotel  Which used to be  The Charles River  Jailhouse  That they built  The hotel in  And we just  Got our puppy  Just got our puppy  Maybe a month before  We thought  Something was wrong  With the motherfucker  Wouldn't bark  Never barked 
[02:18:30]  Ever  This hotel  The first time  It ever barked  It start barking  In the fucking air  In this fucking hotel  That's supposed to be  Haunted  Old jailhouse  No bullshit  It just started  Looking around  Barking at nothing  Jesus  As it's first bark  That is fucked up  The creepiest  That's fucked up  The creepiest night  I ever had in my life  When my grandfather died  He had this armchair  That he always sat in  And the weekend  Of his funeral  I was staying at my grandmom's 
[02:19:00]  And I had to sleep  In the room  That I slept in  When I stayed there  When I was a kid  And I was already  Creeped out  Like you're at your nana's  And it's like  You're in this weird room  It's creepy anyway  Nana's house  I woke up  In the middle of the night  And rolled over  And the house was  Dead quiet  And pitch black  And she had the armchair  She had it moved  Into the room  And it was directly  Across from my eye line  In the bed  I didn't notice it  And I was just waiting  To wake up  And see him sitting there  And I couldn't sleep  Dude  I couldn't sleep  I was sweating  And shit  I was so freaky 
[02:19:30]  But then I woke up  And found a ranger station  And I was fine  I was in Colorado  In a hotel  That was known  As being a haunted hotel  Like you walked in  And there were pamphlets  On the counter  About what had happened  In this hotel  It was an old  Fucking hotel  In Colorado  And went up  Into the room  Big wide hallways  With these scary  Fucking haunted mansion  Type  Like the shining  And shit  Yeah  Exactly  And went into the room 
[02:20:00]  And was just  Couldn't sleep  Had to have the TV  On full blast  With like  Fucking  I'm just looking  For Seinfeld  Or something funny  So I could watch  That shit  I couldn't sleep  Petrified  Nothing happened  Didn't see anything  Didn't hear anything  But it's just  Knowing you're in  That environment  Just freaks me out  When I was a kid  And I'd get freaked out  I would sing the theme  To the Cosby show  Because I was like  Nothing bad can happen  While that's going on  But I just picture 
[02:20:30]  Bill Cosby  Doing this  What a great scene  In the movies  He just gets murdered  Humming the Cosby show  But now they would  Use that in a movie  To fucking  Really get you fucked up  Everything's okay  Wait a minute  That's season six  He's talking about  The first  Nigga play the first season  You fucking asshole  This nigga's playing  Season 12  When Theo had his tongue ring  Yeah not this  Bobby McFerrin version  This is all we have 
[02:21:00]  What do you want from me  There's gotta be  Let me say hi to Tim  In Indiana  Tim  Yeah  I don't know who it was  Opie or Anthony  Told a story  About  When they were younger  They went to  A cabin  And a guy was  Burned in a bed  Oh fuck  That's my  My  I've had  For the sake of the story  A half sister  And one of her relatives  Died  And she inherited  The money 
[02:21:30]  It was just like  Really old house  Way upstate  And he owned those  Horrific like  Hunting motels  Where each room  Was a separate motel  You know what I mean  Back near the woods  Where the mountain  Kind of starts  And we go up there  We go up there  To clean out the place  We're just kids  And uh  Cause my sister's  Gonna inherit  You know  This guy's fucking  Property and what not  And we found out  When we got there  That he  He died  Because he was  Smoking in his room  And I guess  I was 12 
[02:22:00]  So I was old enough  To handle this  My dad decided  Which is fucked up  And I go into the house  To see where the bed  Used to be  That was the only thing  That didn't have a burn mark  Was the square in the rug  Where the bed used to be  And the walls  Were all just  Fucking charred  And plywood  Where the guy died  And my dad  Thought it was the  Coolest thing for us  That we were gonna  Stay up there  For fucking free  And we'd all have  Our own motel room  In the woods  Basically  We were scared  Out of our fucking minds  We didn't understand  Death yet  All your dad 
[02:22:30]  Had to hear up to  Was motel in the woods  And he should've been like  That's a bad idea  So  And he's basically going  You guys pair off  You all get your own  Fucking room  And like  Get the fuck out of here  So we ended up  I mean a large family  There was about 10 of us  At the time  All squeezed into one room  Cause we were scared shitless  And my mom said  We're fucking out of here  The next day  She's like  No way  My dad's plan was  We were gonna hang out there  For like a week  It was gonna be  Our big summer vacation  Nothing is worse  Nothing is worse  Than somebody died  In the house 
[02:23:00]  The way they weren't  Supposed to  Cause that's what it's  So good  My cousin's ex-girlfriend  Lived in a house  In Jersey  And everybody  Swerved down  The house was haunted  Me and my cousin  Didn't believe him at all  And then he told me  One night  What happened was  This lady that lived  In the house  Died of cancer in the house  And it was like a tragic  Young death kind of thing  Right  And he said  He didn't believe  That the place was haunted  He said one night  The parents  Him and his girlfriend  Everybody that lived there  Josephine DeRosa  Yeah exactly  Kind of like me  That's how they'll be 
[02:23:30]  Selling my apartment  Man died here  So the rent's a little low  But he said  They were all sitting  In the living room together  Watching TV  And upstairs  They literally heard like  Get the fuck out of here  Like stomping on the ceiling  Get the fuck out of here  Come on  That's fucked up  How creepy is that  Too creepy  Another quick story  When I was shopping  For a place to live  In Manhattan  I was going around  With a realtor  I told this one too  I was in a brownstone  And they were really anxious 
[02:24:00]  To sell this place  More than usual  And the mom  Of this family  Was running ahead of us  And straightening up  Every room  Making sure everything  Was perfect  As we were walking through  Checking out this place  And we got a really weird  Creepy vibe  So when we left  We were like  Alright  And they're not supposed  To tell you  But we're like  Alright what the fuck  Is the deal  There's obviously  Something that is weird  And not right  With that whole family  And that fucking brownstone  And we're like  Well  They're not supposed  To tell you this  So it's between  Me and you guys  But their son  Committed suicide in there  And they really want 
[02:24:30]  To sell that fucking place  And get the fuck out of there  So now I'm thinking back  To well where the  What spot was it in  In the house  I was just in  Yeah and how did he do it too  I wanted  I wanted all the questions out  Because the mother  Of this  You know  Son that committed suicide  Was with us the whole time  So I'm like  There was a point  We're in some part  Of the house  Where she knows  That's where they found  Their son  I can deal with  The I took pills  To death ghost  But I can't deal  With a Pascal  From Pet Sematary  I blew my head off  Ghost  Would you buy 
[02:25:00]  The Amityville Horror  House for cheap  Hell fucking no  Just in case  For cheap  I don't know what I believe  But fuck no  Nothing's happened  In that house  No even like  I understand that  But it's your mind  That fucks with you  Yeah that's what it would be  That's the problem  Whether they're ghosts or not  It's what your fucking mind does  And I think that's what  My heart  I think is getting weak  So my heart won't allow me  To have one good scare  Yeah and I'm not into  Like cause my favorite show  Probably my top three shows 
[02:25:30]  Of all time  Is Scare Tactics  I love Scare  I just love  Did you believe in that shit  What the show  Yeah  It's the greatest show  Oh wait which one  Are we talking about now  Now I'm confused  Scare Tactics is the one  That they create  Scary scenarios  Oh that aren't real  That aren't real  Okay cause what about  The other one  That I kind of liked  For a while  Where they did do  What we were trying to do  Where they went to  All these haunted places  Oh the ghost hunters  No no  No it's called like  Fear itself  It's still on  I was saying earlier  You should  There was an early version  Of that  And now they redo  The show a lot  But the first one  I think it was on MTV 
[02:26:00]  Or something  I'm not an adrenaline  Junkie man  People love to be scared  And love  I'm not into that shit  I don't either  And never was  No I'm not a fan of that  So set up the fucking  Haunted house  Scare Tactics  Or the haunted prison  Let's do it  I'll do it  I think we'll get  Some good video on it  If Anthony does it  If everybody does it  I'll do it  I won't be a fan of that  Bob Kelly would be perfect  That would be perfect  Fucking dude  What was that  I heard something dude  Dude  Dude  We got a good group  I don't think you can get Bobby to do it 
[02:26:30]  No electricity though dude  No fucking lights  And Norton's already shaped like a gold  We gotta have flashlights  A bunch of flashlights  Yeah but we can't have an out  Where we can just turn some shit on  You gotta have the flashlights  Cause that's the scariest part  Is when you see a child  Quivering in the corner somewhere  I would joke all night long  That's why I wanna do it  I would laugh all night long  That's why I wanna do it  Because it's like  Why would a ghost  I just  The idea that  Anything has human emotion 
[02:27:00]  Is what bothers me  Is that  Like there's aliens up in the sky  Just going  Hmm  And  There's some fucker  Who have an alien  Somewhere in Area 51  Who got a gun  And he's watching  The Area 51  And inside  There's a fucking alien  And he don't tell his wife  Or he don't go  Fuck that  He's so  He's so rigidly trained  That  He doesn't  Eat ass  Like you know what I'm saying  And the ghost  It's like  Okay ready ghost  Really  Are you being 
[02:27:30]  Is there one ghost  That's not gonna stereotype me  And peek around the corner  And then just disappear  Where's the ghost  That's gonna go  I'm here man  Listen  I killed myself  And my body's stuck  But that's not how they were  Well nigga can you eat  You know  But that's not how they were  Let's talk  Yeah there's gotta be one  That would take that  Yeah every ghost is a ghost  Yeah there's gotta be one  That would take that angle  Like this  Normal ones are the ghosts  That go where they're supposed to go  And do what they're supposed to do  When they're dead  These are fucking like  Rogue crazy people 
[02:28:00]  These are like  The homeless people  You see on the street  That talk to themselves  You wanna hear  That's like  Well why don't they do that right there  And then when you call the cops  And say hey  There's a fucking ghost in my house  He's still there  But ghosts are like the fucking  Hello my baby frog  That motherfucker  That motherfucker does it  When I'm looking  Then everybody's around  Hello my baby  Hello my baby  He's dead when everybody else is looking  Get out of here with that shit  It's just  That's why I refute it  It's cause they're not 
[02:28:30]  Why doesn't a ghost just come in  And stand right here in front of us  Don't fucking ask them  There are theories about it  And this is gonna creep you out even more  This is gonna creep you out even more  There are theories with like demons  Demonic souls  Souls cursed to hell  All that shit  That you know  There are levels to hell  There are like nine levels to hell  Yeah  And the demon  Is more powerful  In it's  In it's  In it's  Home level of hell 
[02:29:00]  Whatever you would call it  It's natural habitat of hell  It's the most powerful  But as it climbs up the levels  It gets less popular  Or less powerful  Excuse me  So that would kind of explain  Where if you're seeing evil ghosts  They can only kind of faintly appear to you here  But they faintly  Do faintly shit  Like  If they faintly appear  Just faintly appear  Motherfucker  Don't faintly  Peek around the corner  So I kind of see you  Fuck  Come on man  So  The thing is  When they do their thing 
[02:29:30]  And this is the only thing  That makes me doubt it  I believe  Look  I believe in a lot of things  I do not believe in ghosts  I believe in they exist  Or spirits  But I don't believe  That the little girl from 1812  Is still sitting in that corner  But they're all  Doing the same creepy shit  They was doing in 1812  But they're all fucked up  Like they don't know what to do  Yeah maybe they can't  They're all like  But why does it happen  Anthony  Do you see my point though  I'm like  Exactly  But that's all they do 
[02:30:00]  Why does the ghost  Still have bad  A bad chest cold  Like  Why  You know what  It's the stereotype  It's like  You see a fucking ghost  That goes boo  Like  Yeah  Boo  Like it's a constant  Creeping you out  As opposed to  Hey look man  What's wrong with you  It doesn't matter  Because if that  If the ghost was like  Hi  Hey I just wanted to  I'd be going  I'd rather believe in  Whoopi Goldberg  From Ghost  In that situation 
[02:30:30]  As  Patrick Swayze  He's like  This dude  Who still has emotions  And he's like  Dead  But he's like  Hey help me find my girl  Help me move this penny  Do you think he's really  Going to communicate  With her now  But wait  Here's the thing though  It's not like  They don't make  Did you just say that  Huh  Holy shit  I just caught that  Fuck it  There was no else  To use that  Shitty joke  You fucking asshole 
[02:31:00]  I just caught that  Fucking joke  Joe's an asshole  You couldn't wait  For a fucking  You thought that joke  Was over  You're like  Wow  I can use it again  I just thought of it  Right now  Fucking son of a  That's terrific  We're going to take  A quick break  Joe DeRose is going  To be filming a  Well recording a  Comedy CD  At the Stress Factory  Tonight and tomorrow  Yes sir  Filming the whole time  Recording the whole time  We're going to taping two shows  Tonight and tomorrow  Is it true that fucking  Bobo's warming up for you  I'm supposed to give him 
[02:31:30]  A guest spot tonight  But this  I just said that  To get the fans  To come out  I said I got to come in  Yeah  You like him  You have a second doubt  He shut up  He's like  I didn't forget Joe  I didn't forget  I don't want to  He twittered it  Well how about this  Make sure you catch me  At Joe DeRose's show  How about this  He's here  Yeah I know  How about he auditions  Alright  He gives you  His best two minutes  We'll make believe  That you know  It's the Stress Factory  And then he'll do his thing 
[02:32:00]  And if you like it  Then he can do it for you  At the Stress Factory  Alright  That's fair enough  I'm down with that  At least let him audition today  He's here  And Patrice is going to be  At Bananas Comedy Club  In Poughkeepsie  So those two shows  Aren't really competing  With each other  Because they're far enough  Apart  So see Patrice  Unless some people  From the Stress Factory  Want to just  Come on down  Yeah  Somebody got tickets  We're redeemed  Stress Factory tickets  Two for one  If you got a Stress Factory ticket  If you have a Stress Factory ticket  For tonight, tomorrow 
[02:32:30]  Not only you in  But five of your pals  That's fucked up  That's some fucked up shit  You motherfucking did  Some shit like that  Why would you do that  In his final days  That's not nice  It's the end  It's the end of days  Just don't die in studio  Because I don't want  Your fucking ghost coming back  I would love it  And just Anthony  Couldn't come in here anymore  Because he's too scared  The studio's haunted  The pessimistic depressed ghost  Of Joe DeRosa  Is haunting the studio 
[02:33:00]  A lot of people  Have ghost stories  And places we could  Spend the night  We gotta find someone  That can get this done  For us legally  There's gotta be a place  And the MTV show  Is called Fear  Thank you for that answer  It came in a million times  Over the instant feedback  Alright  Quick break  Open Anthony  We'll continue  Open Anthony  Full House  Patrice O'Neill  And Joe DeRosa  In studio  Now Joe's playing  The Stress Factory  Tonight and tomorrow  And he got Bobo 
[02:33:30]  To do like a guest spot  But now you're  Having second thoughts  I guess  Huh Joe  I wanna have Bobo on  I just don't want it to  You know I gotta record an album  So I just don't want it  To be a goddamn pit  In the show  If you  You know  You think it could go wrong  With retarded Bobo  And his fucking  His uncontrollable  Little hog  Possibly  Still my favorite video  I've done so far  Your fucking reaction 
[02:34:00]  To that video dude  Is painful  One for the ages man  Which video?  It's too long  To get into now  It's just  It's just  Ridiculous to have Bobo on  We learned that Bobo  Gets hard  Very easily  When you start  Talking about broads  You just gotta talk  About a girl  And it gets rock hard  This little fucking thing  He calls a penis  And then you start  Talking about the Mets  And it instantly goes down  It goes away  And then you talk  About girls again  And it goes back  So  We told Patrice about it  And he saw it for the first time  And I got his reaction  On video 
[02:34:30]  It's just ridiculous  Yeah  It's fucking  Ridiculous  It's in the top seven  Laughs of her head  It's  That was a good one  It's an unbelievable thing  The control he's got  Just like that  I was telling you  After the show on Tuesday  Not Tuesday  But the last time I was here  When Bobo took his dick out  And he had the pre-cum  Dripping out of it  That was one of the hardest times  I ever laughed  In my fucking life  Yeah his cock  Has given us a lot of humor  Which is  We've laughed at his dick  Many times  I have it on my phone  You  Hearing  All you see is Bobo 
[02:35:00]  And Danny  And E-Rock  Almost vomiting  When he tries to smell his pubes  And then when you  I'm laughing right into the speaker  Because I'm right next to the phone  And then Anthony's evil laugh  That starts coming in  And then you hear you  Punching the fucking console  Dude it's  So funny man  That's an amazing  So fucking funny  Why don't we get Bobo in  He can at least try out his material  See if it's worthy of you  Oh yeah man  Shit  You having on your show  At the stress factory 
[02:35:30]  That's fucking genius  Yeah  He's opening up for your  For your album  That you're gonna sell  Right  I didn't know it was recorded  When we plugged the date last night  Bobo your hair grows fast  Yeah  Yeah that's  It's always  Yeah that's right  It grows pretty quick  What are you wearing  And talking to the mic  You've been on the show  If you're a cartoon fan  You have to be a cartoon fan  Or a comics fan  And know that Bobo looks like  The mole man right now  The mole man  You have to  You have to be a fan  Of comics  He's the mole man  Right this second  He's just missing his hat 
[02:36:00]  And his fucking  Thing  That he has  Well for some reason  Sam thought this  Sam's idea  To wear this here  What is it  I don't know  Looks like a Snuggie  It's a Snuggie  No it's not a Snuggie  What Danny  It's a Slanket  A Slanket  Nice  But that's just a rip off  Of a Snuggie  No it's not  It's a little different  And it's a WWE  Probably  WWE  Does one of the wrestlers  Wear this Danny  No it just gets cold  In each arena  In the fucking 
[02:36:30]  Quicken Loans arena  It gets freezing  Well we're not going to  Spend a lot of time  With Bobo  Because quite frankly  Drives the audience  Nuts  So  But we want to see  If he's got material  To warm up for Joe  DeRosa  At Stress Factory  Tonight  Yeah Bobo  I want to hear your material  I'm recording my CD tonight  And I didn't know that  Last time  So I gotta  It's gotta be a tight show  Man  If we can't do it this time  We'll do it next time  But  Do some material  Let me hear some of your shit 
[02:37:00]  Before I say  Yeah definitely come down  And you know  Alright well  I'll tell you this one  I have to say  I hate these  Freaking psychiatric drugs  And there are stupid  Side effects  Wait a minute  You gotta go  Right don't you  Everybody  Yeah  Right  Are you sick of it  I'm talking about  Don't you guys  Say psychiatric drugs  Are you guys  Do you guys  Do you hate that  I hate those stupid  Side effects  I was on this one  That I had to get  Taken off  Right after two days  This thing
