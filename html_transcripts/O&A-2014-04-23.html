<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  This pre-show covered the previous day's show highlights, including Anthony's angry rant about Lindsay Lohan and Jim Norton's unsuccessful attempt to get a photo with a grumpy Evander Holyfield (resulting in a humorous picture).  Jim Norton's ongoing quest for celebrity photos was also a topic, alongside the upcoming guest, Russell Simmons.  The pre-show discussed Opie's viral YouTube video featuring a prominent "camel toe" (53,000 views in eight hours), a minor spat with the Canadian radio show Humble and Fred, Donald Trump's tweet criticizing Obama's Air Force One exit, a viral Southwest Airlines flight attendant (and her subsequent Ellen appearance), the NYPD's hashtag fail (“#MyNYPD”), and a Bert Kreischer snowboarding anecdote.  The pre-show concluded with a lengthy discussion about the flight attendant and her daughters, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton all present in studio.

The main show commenced by awarding the viral flight attendant $10,000 from Shutterfly, leading to a discussion about sponsorships and further sexually suggestive comments about the flight attendant's daughters.  The hosts then criticized Paula Poundstone's comedy and past controversies before launching into a significant segment criticizing Chris Christie's stance on marijuana legalization in New Jersey, contrasting it with his inaction on alcohol and other potentially harmful activities.  They played a clip of Christie and received numerous caller opinions, expressing their disdain for Christie's perceived hypocrisy and his attire.

The show moved on to discuss Donald Trump's tweets, particularly one about Obama's gait, followed by a bad knock-knock joke and commercial breaks.  A discussion about “swatting” and online racism in Call of Duty, accompanied by video clips, ensued.  The segment concluded with a graphic and sexually explicit description of a news story involving a woman with a gun concealed in her vagina, filled with sexual innuendo and crude jokes. The segment concluded with a discussion about the dangers of "swatting" and a caller's question for Russell Simmons.  Opie then recounted his past HVAC and sheet metal work experiences, detailing near-miss accidents and injuries with comedic timing.

A subsequent segment focused on the hazardous working conditions of HVAC technicians, with callers sharing graphic accounts of near-misses and accidents, including descriptions of workplace injuries like "degloving."  The hosts interjected with sexually suggestive humor.  The discussion included detailed explanations of HVAC processes and terminology.  Steve the Whistler attempted a musical performance, but technical difficulties with the CD player repeatedly interrupted the performance.  The segment then compared Opie and Anthony's show to Humble and Fred, playing clips and criticizing their style and female co-host, using profanity and sarcasm. The segment ended with a mention of a future "Jocktober" surprise.

Another segment heavily criticized Humble and Fred, deeming them "horrendous" and "useless," playing clips and receiving negative caller feedback.  Listeners detailed Humble and Fred's history of risqué content and poor ratings. One caller mentioned a bizarre photo on their Facebook page.  Opie defended himself against a caller's accusation of oversharing about his children, and the hosts engaged in improvised comedy with their intern, Tori.  Russell Simmons then joined the show in studio.  The discussion covered his support of Occupy Wall Street, his book "Success Through Stillness," misconceptions about meditation, past controversies, and a caller’s positive anecdote about Simmons's helpfulness.  The segment concluded with more comedic banter and the mention of an upcoming encore broadcast.


The segment with Russell Simmons continued, focusing on his book, "Success Through Stillness," meditation, and its mental and physical benefits.  He discussed his past struggles with drug addiction (PCP, cocaine, heroin), his sobriety, and his advocacy work promoting meditation and reducing violence.  He commented on the double standard regarding Gwyneth Paltrow's use of the term "niggas" compared to Jay-Z and Beyoncé, and his views on using words like "faggot" and "bitch." He also discussed gender equality and equal pay in the workplace, and shared personal preferences. He promoted his book and discussed Oprah Winfrey's impact on promoting mindfulness.  The hosts offered their thoughts on Simmons and his interview before the usual show outro and advertisements.


The final segment began with a discussion about massages from men versus women, using crude language.  A caller, Todd, expressed his long-time appreciation for the show.  Another caller, Nick, had a humorous Twitter exchange with Opie about the spelling of his handle.  A dispute between the show's listeners and another radio show's fans on Facebook was discussed.  A caller criticized one of the host’s hairstyles and physical attributes, resulting in sexually explicit and offensive banter.  The hosts discussed a Jamie Lee Curtis commercial and her body in *Trading Places*, using vulgar terms.  Listener calls followed, discussing t-shirt designs, negative opinions of the show's humor, and compliments for a host's appearance.  The hosts discussed a recent Russell Simmons interview and a photobomb incident with Debbie Allen, using offensive language.  The show concluded with chatter about the photobomb, upcoming live shows, and Kevin Spacey's appearance on another radio show. The post-show segment with Sam Roberts reflected on the broadcast, focusing on the Russell Simmons interview, interactions with Humble and Fred, and a lengthy, humorous, and sometimes inappropriate discussion about meditation with the show's staff.  Numerous commercial breaks punctuated the broadcast.

Prepare for the incomparable Opie and Anthony show.  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts. 
[00:01:00]  Welcome. Here we are live on a Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  866-WOW1-WOW is our phone number.  866-969-1969.  My name is Sam Roberts and you can start your mornings with me  as we talk about everything that may very well go down on today's Opie and Anthony show  as well as reflect on everything that happened yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  So much going on this morning that we're going to get into in just a few minutes  when another live Opie and Anthony show takes off.  Metaphorically, of course.  It's not literally going to take off like an airplane.  But you'll feel like it's taking off.  That's what a big deal will be.  Guests today, Russell Simmons is going to be on the show today.  Of course, yesterday we had Burt Kreischer.  Today we have Russell Simmons.  And my expectations are high because a couple years ago he came on the show 
[00:02:00]  and Opie and Anthony told Russell Simmons that I had a very small TV  and he gave me $100 to upgrade it.  And I did.  $100 cash from Russell Simmons.  One of the pioneers of rap as we know it.  Hopefully, there's some other flaw that Opie and Anthony can bring up about me  that will result in Russell Simmons giving me money today.  I don't know. That's my expectations for this segment.  But we all have different expectations. 
[00:02:30]  If you want to share yours, feel free to call the show at 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Now, as I said, Burt Kreischer was on the show yesterday.  A triumphant return to the Opie and Anthony show for Burt.  But before we get into that, there's this moment on yesterday's show that I want to get into.  Before we get too deep into exactly what's going to be happening on today's show.  There was a moment on yesterday's show that is exactly the evilness, the meanness, and the bitterness 
[00:03:00]  that I've come to love about the Opie and Anthony show.  Whenever Ant just flips his mood and becomes, just gets so impassionately angry about something,  it just tickles me. And it happened yesterday.  We were playing a clip from Lindsay Lohan's reality show.  And she was talking about how difficult things are for her, 
[00:03:30]  and how she's not really an addict, but she's just addicted to some things,  but not actually an addict.  And that she couldn't have cameras with her at one point because she had a,  not an abortion, but whatever, a miscarriage.  And just excuse after excuse.  And Ant spoke.  And when Ant speaks sometimes, it's that little voice in the head of most of us  that none of us can say out loud. 
[00:04:00]  And Ant not only says it out loud, but he amplifies it to 11.  Here's Ant on Lindsay Lohan yesterday.  I may have addictions to certain things in life,  but I'm not essentially your typical addict.  That's not who I am.  I'm not that kind of person.  I know the difference between right and wrong and stupid and idiotic  and, you know, what's good and bad.  Like, I know that I was raised well by my parents, but...  And I've seen it.  But there's certain things that people don't... 
[00:04:30]  There's no one around people sometimes.  And I see that now.  Shut up!  Whining, punting.  Enough of her.  But then sometimes I'm like, yeah.  You made your bed, now fuck everyone in it.  Jesus.  Now you gotta deal with Michael Rohan.  Fuck him.  It gets back to him.  He threatened Jimmy last time.  He was none too pleased with my criticism.  Well, his fucking actions through her life have just done wonders for her. 
[00:05:00]  I don't think so.  Oh, I don't either.  Sometimes you need to hear intolerance.  There is so much tolerance on the radio and in media today.  And everybody trying to understand everybody.  And everybody explaining people's problems and everything.  Sometimes you just need a guy like Ant to shout bad words loudly about a person.  I mean, it makes me feel better about myself.  I'm sure that it made you feel better about yourself as well. 
[00:05:30]  And we went into Lindsay Lohan's whole thing.  Of course, if you missed any of it, this shows up on demand.  But another thing I wanted to talk about yesterday, that happened yesterday, was we went over, as I mentioned on the pre-show, we would.  That's the type of predictability I have.  Not predictability, but the ability to predict.  That's why the post-show is such a smart listen. 
[00:06:00]  We talked about Jim and Opie and myself going to meet Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.  And this is a thread that's gone through the Opie and Anthony show for some time.  It's Jim's photo stories.  I mean, I think it was last week, the end of last week, he left the show because he was trying to get a photo with Valerie Harper.  Not a week goes by.  For the last, like, ten years, that there's not some story about Jim trying to get a picture.  And this was Jim's story about trying to get a picture with boxing great Evander Holyfield. 
[00:06:30]  So I turned around, and Holyfield was fucking eight feet away from us, just standing with a guy.  No one was really bothering him.  Oh, so you figured you would.  Yes.  I went over, I got the photo, and he was not happy.  Wow, really?  He took it.  But he was just...  Damn it.  It seemed like he really didn't want to be there.  It seemed like both guys didn't really want to be there, in a way. 
[00:07:00]  But they're so sick of fame, I think.  They're so recognizable.  I don't think that they get off on any of that stuff anymore.  You know where they both seemed relaxed and enjoying themselves at the dinner?  Because it was just people that they kind of knew there.  We probably shouldn't have been invited to.  But Jim also did not confront Evander Holyfield as if he was also in show business.  Oh, no.  There was nothing that was sort of screamed peers.  Yeah.  Well, that's how Jimmy works, though.  That's how he gets his stuff done. 
[00:07:30]  What did he touch his arm?  Van?  Well, you know, not far off.  Oh, no.  I kind of sauntered up, and they were shooing people away.  But I did my, like, I'm a sick kid look at me face.  Your normal look.  Exactly.  Which meant I just walked up.  Right.  And Sam pointed out that I didn't say the words properly.  Oh, no.  Like, I didn't say, can I have a picture with you?  Then I kind of little boyed it.  And I said, uh, come a picture.  Come a picture.  I didn't mean to do that.  Oh, no.  He said, could. 
[00:08:00]  I have a picture.  Come a picture.  I have a picture.  Mr. I just ate some skitties.  And before he could say no, Jim had already turned around and looking straight at the camera.  So there's a photo of Jim just smiling.  And Irvander Holyfield with a scowl across his face.  Oh, that's great.  He couldn't have been unhappy.  Yeah.  I don't think that Jim put the photo across social media yet.  But it really is a funny photo.  And it was unbelievable when I saw it. 
[00:08:30]  I was like, oh, my God.  Jim, how accomplished do you have to be in the world of comedy before you stop going  up to people and saying, could I have a picture?  It's like, just introduce yourself.  Hey, I'm Jim Norton.  I'm a comedian.  You mind taking a photo real quick?  But I don't know.  I mean, look, I can't criticize Jim's technique because he gets the job done every single time.  Let's start with some calls.  866-WOW1-WOW if you want to call the pre-show.  And let's go to Ian in Toledo. 
[00:09:00]  What's up, Ian?  Hey, Sammy, is that in Pesos, Roberts?  That's right.  I was just wondering, you guys said you had Russell Simmons coming in today.  Are you familiar with all the great work you did with Bofa?  No.  Bofa-D's nuts!  Love it.  Love it.  Bofa-D's nuts.  That's that.  I would have gone a bit further and said we're Bofa-D's.  That's the way you got to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to go with Bofa-D's. 
[00:09:30]  Do you know what he did with Bofa-D's?  He used that at home, ladies and gentlemen.  Opie got into his insecurities a little bit when we were talking about the Evander Holyfield thing.  Because Jim met Evander at a movie premiere.  It was at Tribeca and it was a documentary Champs with Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield and Bofa-D's.  All starring Bofa-D's nuts!  All starring in this movie.  And so they were all there and then we got invited.  Well, they got invited and I tagged along to the dinner afterwards. 
[00:10:00]  Which was a more intimate thing.  There were probably only like 40 people there.  And Opie got into his insecurities about really feeling like he shouldn't have been at the dinner whatsoever.  It was nice.  It was a really nice dinner.  I just felt like we were imposing a bit.  Yeah, when the director did his speech thanking everybody and how everybody in the room was a special person in his life.  A special person in his life that was closely associated with this project. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, boy.  I looked down.  I just kind of looked down.  I have nothing to do with anything in this room.  I checked my Twitter at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, we'll help promote certainly because we're boxing fans and we're kind of friends with Tyson at this point.  But we had nothing to do with the movie.  I mean, not a goddamn thing.  No.  And we saw him outside.  That was the coolest.  Yeah.  Because Tyson finally said, I'm done with this room.  And he left early.  Him and his wife kind of leave separately. 
[00:11:00]  I think that's how a lot of tremendously famous people do it.  They go outside.  Then the spouse does.  It seems like this way no one, the whole room doesn't rush over.  It's like, goodbye, goodbye.  Sure, yeah.  And we chatted for a few minutes.  He kind of called us over.  We're like, hey, Mike, I want to just thank you for inviting us, whatever.  And then he's like, hey.  And then we talked for a bit on the road.  It really was amazing because we were in a room full of strangers.  Like, we didn't know why we were there really and didn't know anybody in the room except for one person. 
[00:11:30]  The friendliest guy in the room to us was Iron Mike Tyson.  He was the one guy that was like, yeah, stick around.  It's amazing, especially coming from the port.  I mean, we remember his first appearance only at this point, I guess it was probably a year or two ago here on the O&A show.  And, I mean, he just clicked with the show.  I saw it firsthand.  The guy loves the Opie and Anthony show.  Whether he's on this show or not, he was so excited to see Opie and Jim specifically at this thing. 
[00:12:00]  Mike Tyson was.  It was really quite amazing.  And I know he's going to be a fan of Opie's latest YouTube video.  I love seeing what the guys do when they get home.  That's why I follow him on Twitter and everything.  Opie watches a lot of news and just looks for the little nuggets, as he says.  Little nuggets that pop out and tell the story beyond the story.  He found one of those last night and he posted a YouTube video.  It's a news report featuring a woman with a massive camel toe. 
[00:12:30]  And so he puts a YouTube video up of the news report, but just a real close-up of the camel toe.  And it is.  It's the most insane camel toe I've ever seen, like to the point where I'm surprised that it wasn't blurred out because they were worried about an FCC violation.  But check that out if you haven't already.  I'm sure we'll get into it on the show today.  Also on the show today, I promise you, I think this show was called Humble and Fred.  It was either Humble and Fred or Humble and Frank. 
[00:13:00]  I'm blanking on it now, but I think Humble and Fred.  Humble and Fred are this Canadian radio show.  And, I mean, they were so far off our radar that I didn't even think they were going to come up yesterday.  I didn't really mention them to Opie and Anthony.  So, you know, I got some tweets about them, you know, talking shit about ONA.  But I figured they're such a small show, it doesn't even matter.  Somebody called up yesterday.  They asked about Humble and Fred taking shots.  We played the clip on the air.  And we barely mentioned them.  Like, I don't even have a clip to share with you because it was that short of a thing. 
[00:13:30]  It was a non-issue.  But I've already checked this morning, and there's still strange Facebook messages being posted on their wall this morning.  People were wishing them a good morning and then posting very inappropriate photos.  But there will be some follow-up with that show today.  There will be.  I promise you that.  Okay?  And when Sam Roberts promises you something, you can take that to the bank.  So that's what you have to look forward to today.  Humble and Fred.  You have Opie's YouTube video. 
[00:14:00]  You have Russell Simmons in studio.  There's a great Donald Trump tweet about Obama.  I love Donald Trump's Twitter.  If I could only follow one person, if I could follow four people.  Opie, Anthony Jim, Donald Trump.  That's who I would follow.  So yesterday, he tweeted out a criticism of the way Obama walks down the stairs from Air Force One.  That's what he was worried about.  Opie is now showing me in the window.  He can't even hear that I just talked about it. 
[00:14:30]  He's in the big studio through the glass showing me the camel toe.  And he's saying, what's that?  53,000 views.  You posted that last night?  What did he say?  Eight hours ago.  Oh, my God.  That's the secret to going viral is camel toes.  Eight hours in, and Opie has 53,000 views on his YouTube video.  That is amazing.  Yeah, if he's going to try to talk, see if you can... 
[00:15:00]  Comes after him.  Okay, he's got the...  Go ahead, Opie.  Can we hear him?  Put yourself on.  What?  Okay, I can hear you.  Why are you bothering me?  I can't...  We were literally just talking about that video before you showed it to me.  Oh, really?  That's the camel toe video.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  53,000 views in eight hours?  Yeah.  Does that make you think that, like, every time you're trying to be creative with stuff...  That's what I was telling Kenny on the way in.  And I'm like, why bother trying to edit shit and work with other people and gather fucking 
[00:15:30]  concepts and video clips and music and this and that, when all you have to do is, you  know, videotape your laptop when they show a camel toe on the news.  And that's it.  And just make sure the screenshot of the video is a camel toe.  I clicked on it.  You did, right?  Of course I did.  As soon as you posted it, I was like, what's this camel toe?  Nice.  Yeah.  And you gotta laugh, too.  Of course.  You need the Opster laughing on the video.  Well, yeah, because you're...  That brings it together, I think.  Well, you're speaking for all of us watching. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, oh, good.  You know, we're watching, oh, the Opster's right there with us.  I was like, oh, wow, this was kind of cool.  I bet you I'll do, I don't know, maybe 5,000 to 7,000 views overnight.  And I checked it in the morning, and it's like 50...  Now it's up to like 55,000 views.  But it's crazy, because like on your YouTube channel, you put together like the...  ...really well-done news tease video, right?  Right.  Where it's like every news tease, and it's graphically pleasing, and the words are falling everywhere, 
[00:16:30]  and like...  Right.  And you push it.  You push that video all the time.  I see you pushing it.  All right, all right.  I'm a whore.  And it's...  But the one that really clicks...  Is some dumb, stupid, throwaway video.  Yeah, the news tease video.  Funny, scary, ridiculous news teases, which is all the news teases we collected over the  years on the Opie and Anthony show.  And then I just kind of, you know, we put it to graphics and stuff.  That only has 14,000 views.  And that one took a lot of work.  Dude, ridiculous amount of work.  It took like three or four days.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  And this thing, I just like, oh, let me film this camel toe and put it on my channel.  Well, the camel toe was amazing.  I mean, I was telling Sal that it felt like it was almost an FCC violation.  It was so blatant.  Do you think the news knew exactly what they were doing?  100%.  They were like, holy shit, look at this woman.  She goes, I don't want my face on the news, but you could put my camel toe on the news.  Oh, so that's what it was?  Like, they pointed down... 
[00:17:30]  I thought you were like super zoomed in on it.  No, I thought I gave you enough of the news story.  She's an eyewitness to a robbery.  Uh-huh.  I made a perfect video.  I edited it perfectly so you get the whole story, Sam.  I was really just paying attention to the camel toe, I have to be honest.  When the news part started, I was like, how far do I have to skip along to get to the camel toe?  Yeah, well, she was an eyewitness to like a break-in.  And she said, hey, I don't want my face on the news, but I'll tell you what I saw.  Do you think like the community knows exactly who this lady is? 
[00:18:00]  Of course.  They know her from her vagina.  It couldn't be any more clear.  Like, oh, it's the woman with the fattest vagina in town, who insists on wearing yoga pants everywhere she goes.  At my house, we were laughing all night because there's so much going on in that video.  Because she knows she has a giant camel toe.  Yeah.  So you can see in the video, her hands are trying to cover it.  But then she needs her hands to talk because she's animated a little bit.  But as soon as she stops using her hands to talk, she puts it right back in front of the camel toe. 
[00:18:30]  But the cameraman is filming over the top of the hands.  Of course, because he knows.  He knows exactly what he is.  So if you had the forethought to say, well, I don't want my face shown on television.  Right.  Wouldn't you think he'd be like, let me put on some baggy sweatpants because my vagina is protruding out of my pants?  You would think, Sam.  But I think what happened here is the news just came to her, to her front door.  Yeah.  And just said, hey, we got to interview you right now.  And she's thinking, put my camel toe. 
[00:19:00]  And they see her.  What about my camel toe?  And they see her.  So they're going, no, no, no.  It has to be right now.  We don't have time to wait.  Exactly.  So we were laughing so hard.  It's so ridiculous.  You think she got the family together?  Oh, I'm going to be on the news tonight.  They didn't show my face.  I didn't want them to show my face.  But still, it'll be fun.  See me on the news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's all it takes.  Oh, just a puffy vagina.  What else is going on?  Why am I doing the pre-show?  Are you guys going to, did you read Donald Trump's tweet about Obama? 
[00:19:30]  I did not.  That's what you were just talking about after the thing.  Well, this is the stuff I'm supposed to be doing now instead of being on the radio with you.  I'm supposed to be preparing.  Well, I'm informing you.  Like, you don't, don't, don't, like, I'll tell you about things, but don't talk about them too much.  Just kind of let them sink in and then save them for later.  Wait, he's tweeting about how unprofessional Obama walks?  Yes.  Oh, that's great.  I can't wait to read that one.  It's such a great tweet.  And did you get the Ellen video?  No.  Remember on Friday, I think it was, when Voss was in? 
[00:20:00]  And we were talking about that stewardess doing stand-up on the airplane?  Oh, yeah.  And we all said, or, well, let's be honest, I said, that she would end up on Ellen or Jimmy Fallon.  Was she on Ellen?  She was on Ellen yesterday.  Oh, that's awesome.  And being praised for how funny and clever she was on the plane doing her announcements.  So, we got that as well.  And we're pulling the John, we're trying to find it right now, but we should be able to find it.  The John Montone report.  I don't know if you heard it driving in.  No.  But he's reporting on the NYPD hashtag fail. 
[00:20:30]  Dude, you know what?  Hey, Ant.  We're huge fans of the NYPD, but what an epic fail.  What is the hashtag they thought would be all nice for the community?  I think it's like NYPD saves, or my NYPD.  Yeah, my NYPD.  So, all the homies and everyone else who don't like the NYPD in general decided to post the most horrific pictures of the NYPD. 
[00:21:00]  Some would say being bad, but I don't think so.  I think they were trying to take care of situations.  I saw a photo of an NYPD officer with his knee on a dog's neck.  Well, you've got to do that.  Those dogs could be vicious.  Correct.  What dog was it?  Did you see the other one where they're frisking the dog?  The dog is up against the wall?  No.  You didn't see that one?  No, I didn't see that one.  Oh, it's great.  It's hilarious.  Hashtag my NYPD.  But I really want you guys to hear...  But they're basically saying it could be one of the worst epic fails ever. 
[00:21:30]  Ever.  Someone wasn't thinking.  No, not at all.  I want you guys to hear the John Montone report, because I was driving in listening.  And he goes, a hashtag turned into a bash tag.  Oh, God.  Oh, it's John.  Good old John Montone.  There's also...  And then the swatting we'll talk about, I guess, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  With the...  Just getting the entire police force onto...  But what does this have to do with my giant camel toe video, Sam Roberts? 
[00:22:00]  Anthony, did you see the camel toe video?  No, I was Twitter dark yesterday.  Oh, I hope he's got a viral phenomenon on his hands.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  I do.  Finally?  Yes.  Well, I've had a few viral videos, sir.  But I do play along with the audience when they say that, you know, I'm hoping for a  viral video.  I have a couple of multi-million.  I have a few over a million.  I would say if you get over a million, that's a viral, right?  What about over five million?  That's okay.  That's a good start.  Apple 5?  Apple 5.  But yesterday, this guy DJ Space City, I think. 
[00:22:30]  Is that his Twitter handle?  Does it matter after the DJ part?  He sends me a video of this news clip of a break-in.  But I don't think he even realized what he sent me.  Yeah.  And there were six teens breaking into a house.  And they have an eyewitness, the neighbor.  Oh.  But she doesn't want to be on camera.  So the cameraman goes, okay, I'll just film you talking and I'll just point my camera down. 
[00:23:00]  And what he was pointing at, and he had to know, was a giant camel toe.  Not even an element of doubt?  No.  Oh, my God.  So all I did was I just filmed my stupid laptop, laughed over it, and it already has 55,000 views in six hours.  Look.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me take a look-see.  I mean.  What do you got?  A fucking plasma TV there?  Oh, that's this. 
[00:23:30]  I've never seen this happen.  Oh.  Wow.  Here, they go back to it.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That's a huge camel toe.  That camel toe should be blurred out.  It's offensive.  My thought at first, well, the question I asked was, do you think the news knew?  Of course they did.  Uh-huh.  Because I think most news cameramen are male to begin with, right? 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sam, we don't need you anymore.  Thanks.  Oh, shit.  I love it.  Sam's like, I love it.  Yeah.  So he had to know, and they just said, look what we got.  So she didn't want her face on the news.  So he put the camel toe, he fucking filmed her camel toe?  And now our neighbors probably know who she is by the camel toe.  Of course.  That's what I'm thinking.  Just her accent.  And she probably walks around the neighborhood like that.  I've seen some, it's those yoga pants. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  Oh, do they make giant camel toes.  Aren't they beautiful?  Well, in most cases.  But it's starting to become one of those fashion trends that the people that shouldn't wear it  are wearing out on the streets.  Kind of like the juicy sweatpants.  Yes.  Big gals.  Bigger gals are starting to wear them.  Sam, can we go off the air now?  I have to prepare for a radio show.  I mean, I don't know.  I feel like you guys are just revving up.  This is exactly what the pre-show should be.  Just you guys kind of...  No.  No?  You tricked me into going on the radio with you. 
[00:25:00]  How do you do that?  I don't know.  I came walking in all of a sudden.  I see the on-air light on when I'm walking down the hall.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Well, let's be honest.  I'm a whore for a viral video, so...  Oh, okay.  Well, I get a few more views.  Yeah.  Go to my Twitter, Opie Radio, for that giant camel toe video.  And we'll see you in a few minutes.  Yes.  Yeah, just a few.  Oh, my God.  Bye, Sam.  Bye, Sal.  Bye, everybody.  Thank you for stopping by.  Opie and Anthony, you never know what's going to happen here on the ONA Pre-Show.  That's why you have to listen every day. 
[00:25:30]  Don Wicklund and Tim Sabian are going to be happy with Sam, huh?  Oh, Sambo is looking strong this morning.  He's looking strong.  I don't even know if we need clips.  Let's go to Jay in Tampa.  What's up, Jay?  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  I'm on the broadcast with Sam Roberts.  I just want to know if you guys...  Bringing up to them guys today, if anybody saw Jimmy Kimmel last night, Don Rickles killed  on Jimmy Kimmel last night.  Don Rickles is amazing. 
[00:26:00]  After all these years, he is still just annihilating on these talk shows.  He's been doing talk shows since they started.  88 years old, sharp as a tack.  I'm dying to hear Jimmy take on it.  He was unbelievable last night.  I'm sure he loved it.  Thanks, Jay.  I was talking to Jim the other day about how good Don Rickles is in Casino, and we were  talking about all the stories of Rickles roasting Robert De Niro on the set, and De Niro loving 
[00:26:30]  it, but Joe Pesci, he was not a fan.  Joe Pesci doesn't like to get roasted, apparently.  That's what we've heard.  I don't know.  Before we run out of time, I kind of wanted to play a little, give Bert Kreischer a little  love.  He did really well on the show yesterday.  Of course, I feel like we got enough plugs in for Opie's YouTube video.  Yeah.  Before we go over one more time exactly what's going to happen on today's Opie and Anthony  show, Bert Kreischer was in yesterday, and he told a story that got me claustrophobic. 
[00:27:00]  It was along the same lines of when we were talking about people getting trapped in avalanches,  far less dangerous, but still terrifying.  It was Bert Kreischer and his snowboarding mishap.  I've had a few moments where I thought I was going to die on this show.  We went heliskiing, and I'd never really snowboarded in powder before, and we're at like 12,000,  13,000 feet in the Alps, and I fucking ate it face forward, and I landed in four feet  of powder, and I couldn't get myself out. 
[00:27:30]  And then mind you, you're following a guide who's telling you where not to go because  there's crevasses, and there's avalanches, and there's all that shit, and I'm following  and watching, but I'm also listening to Wilco.  I'm a little out of it.  Like, I'm having a good time, but then I eat it, and I'm stuck face forward.  I'm thinking, is anyone behind me?  Like, no one's behind me.  I'm fucking here forever.  Holy shit.  And I couldn't get myself.  I kept pushing.  Were you buried?  Buried.  Buried, and I'm fucking.  Wait, we were just talking about this the other day.  Could you breathe under there?  A little bit.  You can, but panic is so fucking intense. 
[00:28:00]  Well, he was in powder.  You were in soft powder.  I was in touched powder.  Yeah.  We were talking about avalanches, but it's similar, at least.  It was, I was lost.  You're like in quicksand that's snow.  And I have a snowboard on my feet, and I'm face forward, and every time I push, my hands  are just going deeper in snow.  Right.  That sucks.  Oh, dude.  And I thought to myself, this is how I die.  I remember thinking.  Oh, man.  How'd you get out?  And I'm out of breath because there's no oxygen up there.  And I'm fucking tired from snowboarding. 
[00:28:30]  And I'm, and I got music blaring in my hair, ears.  So I can't hear anything.  Can you move your arms and stuff?  All I can do is this.  Oh, my God.  And I cannot get myself off the fucking.  He's showing us just pushing forward a little bit.  It's just fucking, it's going right in.  So how'd you get out?  So I'm sat there, and then all of a sudden, something grabbed my jacket and pulled me  up.  And it's a Swedish guy, or Swiss guy.  And he's like, you should see your sound guy.  And my sound guy had fucking eaten shit and was up, all you saw upside down were skis  sticking in the air.  And I was like, holy shit.  So they brought a helicopter in to get him off the mountain.  And then, and then we skied down. 
[00:29:00]  But it was, it was really like, well, I've had a few of those moments on this show where  you just go like, like, it's, it's intense.  It's fucking intense.  It's what the show's about now.  It's like, now it's really high energy, like, wow, fucking thrills.  It does seem terrifying.  I mean, it seems silly because you're just sitting there in the snow, but it seems I, I couldn't,  that's why I don't go outdoors very often.  I just stay in my house, sit on my couch and realize nothing bad can happen to me as long  as I'm not moving very much.  Uh, Trucker Tom in Tennessee. 
[00:29:30]  What's up, buddy?  Welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, Sam Roberts.  You're bringing it to the top level, buddy.  I tell you what, that was the best special guest you ever had on your show there.  I think so.  I think today's pre-show, thank you, Trucker Tom, will go down.  In history, it's one of the greatest of all time, mainly because never before have we had  such high caliber guests, too, on the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Opie and Anthony, yes.  We tricked them into doing some extra radio this morning, and they're getting ready to 
[00:30:00]  do even more.  Jim Norton has joined them in studio.  The gang's all here.  They will be joined later this morning by Russell Simmons, who's going to teach everybody how  to relax.  He's got a new book out.  He's going to teach everybody how to calm down.  But I think, I mean, I'd like to first learn how to make billions of dollars, and then learn  how to calm down.  Like, I want to do it in his order.  Because if I was like a billionaire, then maybe it'd be a little easier for me to just 
[00:30:30]  live in the inner peace.  Also, we'll talk about the Donald Trump tweet, the New York PD hashtag fail situation.  I'm sure we'll get into Opie's camel toe again.  The video, not his actual.  For Opie, it'd be a moose knuckle.  And we didn't talk about this with LNA, but Chris Christie went on a local New Jersey radio  station to talk about how bad marijuana is.  We'll get into all that and more right now, because that is when the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:31:00]  begins.  We'll get into all that and more right now. 
[00:31:30]  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  We'll get into all that and more right now.  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  It was beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony's showing. 
[00:35:00]  You're out of show on the road.  Through 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable from mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  Bottle rockets and brow bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the cocks.  They've met friends along the way. 
[00:35:30]  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations, it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere comes a radio show that, after 20 years, remains above all else, real. 
[00:36:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everybody.  How's things since the last time we talked?  I'm tired.  You're tired?  A little bit today.  Yeah, we'll tuck it out.  We'll tuck it out.  We just talked on the pre-show, so now this is stupid. 
[00:36:30]  Right?  I know.  Like, we're just coming on.  Right.  Hey!  We already did ten minutes.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Don Rickles was on Jimmy Kimmel last night.  Jimmy Kimmel's really doing that, the host has to sit higher than the guest thing.  Oh, yeah?  All late night talk show hosts do that, but Kimmel's really taking advantage of it.  Yes.  And he sits way higher than the guest.  He's 87.  Rickles is 87? 
[00:37:00]  Puts you in the power position.  Oh, always, yeah.  There was a brilliant bit with Andy Kaufman back in the day where he kind of...  He took it to the, as they say, umpteenth level.  Yeah, his chair was, what, ten feet off the ground?  Yeah, it was a giant chair.  He looked like a judge.  And he was looking straight down at his guest, who had to look way up to talk to Andy Kaufman  as a talk show host on this, I don't know, comedy special he did or whatever.  Loved Andy Kaufman.  God, I love that guy.  He really liked uncomfortability.  That's why I love him, Jimmy. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, he really thrived.  That spoke to me when I was growing up.  Making people uncomfy.  Yes, I love it.  Uncomfy.  He did it on comedy clubs, too.  He didn't do it like these special rooms.  He did it in just regular old comedy clubs, too, where people would just get pissed.  He would read, what, The Great Gatsby?  And people would go, oh, that's funny.  He's just reading The Great Gatsby.  It's funny for fucking a couple of minutes, maybe.  But that's the brilliance of Andy Kaufman.  He's like, oh, yeah, you think this is funny that I did this? 
[00:38:00]  He wouldn't stop until the last person left the comedy club.  I'm sure somebody sat all the way to the end.  But for the most part, he cleared out the room by just reading The Great Gatsby instead  of doing his stand-up.  And then on Ellen, we said this was going to happen.  You weren't here.  It was Friday.  Rich Voss was in, and there's this stewardess on Southwest, and she decided to have fun  with the announcements.  And she was basically doing a stand-up routine. 
[00:38:30]  And, you know, Jimmy loved it.  I loved it.  And Rich Voss hated it and couldn't understand why we would love it so much.  But I did say that she would be on Ellen.  And there she is.  And guys like, you know, Rich Voss, he can't get on Ellen.  And he's way funnier.  He's way funnier than this broad.  Yeah.  But I did say that it seems like she's trying to, you know, be a stand-up on the side or 
[00:39:00]  something.  Not just some flight attendant that she's got some prepared material.  Yeah.  Did you see this?  Just part of it?  We don't have to play the whole thing again.  You can pretend to have your attention for just a few moments.  My ex-husband, my new boyfriend, and their divorce attorney are going to show you the  safety features of the public 737-800 series.  It's been a long day for me.  So properly fasten your seatbelt.  Slide the flat into the buckle to release.  Lift up on the buckle.  Position your seatbelt tight and lower across your hips like my grandmother would.  If you get mad, you want to take your toys and get on.  There's eight ways to get there. 
[00:39:30]  Two forward exit doors, short wing window exits, two rear exit doors, signs overhead, disco  lights on the floor, leave each exit.  Everybody gets a door prize in the seatbelt pocket in front of you, along with dirty diapers,  chewing gum wrappers, banana peels, and all other gifts you leave for.  This is a safety information card.  Take it out.  Check it out.  You'll notice in a highly unlikely event for the Captain Lens Snare, a hot tub, everybody  can see your carry out.  You're looking at that.  Yeah.  I wrote my prediction down.  Do that.  Do that. 
[00:40:00]  I hope that you'll tell them how good-looking they are.  You're going to make sure your seat backs and trays are everywhere.  You're full, upright, and absolutely blessed in comfortable condition possible.  And you're down.  I'm so trapped in front of you leaving absolutely no rope, your knees or feet.  As you know, it's a no smoking, no whining, no complaining flight.  It's a pleasing thank you, and you are such a good-looking flight attendant fly.  Smoking has never allowed before in South West, because smoking in the lavatory is about $2,000 and if you wanted to pay that for your airfare, you should have loaned somebody else. 
[00:40:30]  If we do make you that nervous in the next hour and a half, you're more than welcome to step outside.  We don't discriminate at South West. We have a special smoking section just for you.  We'll need to show you a movie tonight we have Up in the Air.  And the flight attendant is serving you. Her name is Wendy, and her motto is, if you can light it, you can smoke it.  There you go.  She's killing. She's killing. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know if I was wrong. This was my prediction.  I don't know what Anthony will hate her.  Of course. You know what? I don't. I sort of said the same thing on Friday.  I hate her.  I mean, I don't.  You hate her. I could tell.  I mean, I don't hate it, but I don't understand why they're laughing so hard at her.  I mean, she's well prepared. She's done that a million times.  It's obvious why.  Why? 
[00:41:30]  People are nervous flying a fucking plane.  Anything that takes you out of that standard issue fucking flight makes you feel good.  You feel like if she's doing that, you're not going to crash.  Right.  For some fucking reason, you're like, no, this plane won't crash. We got a funny fucking flight attendant.  It's a great angle. JetBlue likes to have a little fun, too.  They needed the money!  The pilot will, like, have some levity.  Oh, yeah.  And then, you're right. It kind of makes you...  Malaysian Airlines is hilarious, too.  Those pilots are a hoot.  Yeah.  Remember that joke that he told? 
[00:42:00]  I hope you kiss your loved one goodbye.  We're going to fly, what, eight hours into nothingness.  Yeah.  Until we run out of fuel.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Wait, we are?  We play Into the Wild soundtrack any better?  Yeah, you know, that's a good angle.  Yeah, people are very nervous, so they'll laugh at anything.  If the pilots make just a slight little joke or a little something...  Everything's got to be okay.  You breathe a little easier, I think.  Isn't that good when you hear that boom?  Right. 
[00:42:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're...  You're like, oh, oh!  Right.  If he's got time to chat with us, nothing's on fire in the cockpit.  I think if the pilots talked just a little more, I think so many more people would...  Just be cool, yeah.  ...would have an okay, you know...  Absolutely.  ...time with flying.  Yeah.  But the point here, you know, to stick up for our stand-up friends, you know, that's  what frustrated Rich, and even though Jimmy was fucking with Rich, and Jimmy as well,  you know, she's making it look like anyone could do their craft and do it well. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know why...  I didn't...  It was fun to watch Vos get so offended and annoyed, but I really don't like good-natured  stuff.  That's what annoys me is good-natured.  That was good-natured.  I don't know why it bugs me.  It stinks.  They don't like little fun jokes that everyone on the plane likes.  You didn't like the low around the hips like Grandma's bra?  Well, I guess because in those moments, I think of how many...  Funny or saggy tits joke.  ...brutal things you could say.  Yeah.  There's so many really mean, awful...  Like, I just hate the thing that makes everyone feel okay. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  No, I'm like, you ought to just really fucking belly punch them.  It was making everyone feel okay.  You should heckle her, though.  You're like, oh, wow, what, Bob?  Oh, wow, what, Bob?  Jesus.  Just ruin her act.  You want to hear a little more of her?  Of her?  Yes, it would get you in trouble.  Want to hear a little more?  Boy, this woman's BOMBING!  Oh, no, it's...  You're in trouble.  Imagine just yelling, you suck!  Right.  Boo!  They would hate you. 
[00:44:00]  People would look at you like, oh, she's up there doing a good job,  and you're being a fuddy-duddy.  But she delivered it flawlessly, I had to say that.  Because she's done this a million times.  She has three to four, you know, good minutes of material that she knows goes over well.  That's the Southwest, huh?  She had nice tits.  Yes, she did.  Big implants.  Yeah.  You can see the old lady elbows, though.  I noticed that, too.  They've got to figure that out for the old ladies that have the big, giant, brand-new breasts.  Oh, wow.  The neck they're figuring out a little bit, but you can't hide those elephant elbows. 
[00:44:30]  Popeye elbows.  Why don't you hear a little more?  Because you're enjoying it so much.  If we lost the cabin pressure, if we did, we certainly wouldn't be at work tonight.  But if needed, for lunch, your mask is off the compartment overhead.  Stop screaming, leg over your neighbor, pull under that plastic tubing and fully send it,  and place the mask over your nose and mouth everywhere you normally.  To activate the wall of oxygen, simply insert 75 cents for the first minute,  and 50 cents for everything you can send in.  Although that plastic bag may not insulate, you are receiving lots and lots of gin. 
[00:45:00]  And if you're traveling with small children, we're sorry.  If you're traveling with more than one child, pick out the one that you think might have the most earning potential down the road.  And if you're traveling with somebody needing very special assistance, like your husband, bless the start,  or your wife put on your vest first.  That's it for the news and notes of show-and-tell.  Sit back and relax, or you can sit up and be tense.  Either way.  The clock is already ticking.  Seriously, if there's anything at all that we can do to make your flight more enjoyable, 
[00:45:30]  please tell us.  Just as soon as we land in Salt Lake City.  And if there's anything you can do to make our flight more enjoyable,  we'll tell you immediately.  We're going to shine in Southwest.  That's what we call very cheap entertainment.  Nobody had to pay extra, but you certainly don't get a refund.  That's amazing to you in Southwest.  Welcome aboard.  They're fucking...  It's a flying comedy club.  I would jump up and say something.  What would you say?  I don't know what I love.  Of course you don't know whatever.  Thank you.  Thanks for that. 
[00:46:00]  But she made it to Ellen yesterday is the point.  Oh, that's good.  Why would we replay that?  Of course.  I wish Ross was here.  He'd be so unhappy.  Oh, man.  I said this would happen.  This was perfect for Ellen or Jimmy Kimmel.  Not Jimmy Kimmel.  Probably Jimmy Fallon.  She's going to take off, I bet.  Oh, see what I did there?  A little good-natured.  A star is born.  She's not going to be a stewardess for too much longer.  Oh, man.  Let's see what Ellen said about this.  I didn't see this clip yet.  Ten million people viewed our first guest video.  Take a look at a little bit of this.  Oh, God. 
[00:46:30]  We can pretend to have your attention.  We don't need to hear it again.  Again.  Seriously, if there's anything at all that we can do to make your-  Hi!  How long have you been a flight attendant number one?  About seven and a half years.  And I just have to tell you how happy I am to be here.  She's touching Ellen's head.  I love you so much.  I love you and respect and admire you.  I just love you.  Seriously.  She's got a tissue in her hand.  She has great legs.  I can watch your show in an hour.  You can make me laugh and cry.  And it just, I just adore you.  I just think you're wonderful.  You're a psychopath. 
[00:47:00]  Thank you very much.  Well, obviously, you had an impact on me as well.  Thank you.  That was not only because people try to be funny on flights, but that was really funny.  That whole thing.  If you go online, it's like three minutes of very funny stuff.  And how long have you been doing it that way?  I'm a panic.  You know, we did learn it a certain way.  I was trained a certain way.  And I just, at some point in time, just kind of put my own spin on it.  And it's just so much more fun to make people laugh and let them relax.  You know how stressful flying can be.  And so it's just, it's just made it more fun. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  And it's just, in my little tube in the sky, I can make a difference in some people's  lives.  And it does.  That's an important place to make a difference because people are fearful of flying and people  are going for different reasons that may be sad to them.  And you start out getting their attention by saying, can I pretend to have your attention  for a minute?  Because no one is paying attention.  No.  And we should be paying attention because what you're saying is very important stuff.  You don't have to pay attention.  And you're working your ass off up there.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, you know, I always think that that is a...  Crashing scream at the end of the announcement. 
[00:48:00]  You're serving people and taking care of people and people are rude.  And so I admire what you do and the fact that you care about making people laugh.  Exactly.  I really touched a little nipple tweak.  Fluxed.  She's having a serious talk with...  I know.  You can keep playing it, Sal.  We're not going to miss anything.  Yeah.  We'll just battle over it.  She loves Ellen, though.  They're great ladies.  Oh, yeah.  So...  She looks real nice all cleaned up, this stewardess.  You have two daughters and a son, and two of your daughters are here.  Yeah.  Whoa!  Hold on.  We went... 
[00:48:30]  I apologize for anything negative I said about this delightful woman.  Sal.  Good one, Sal.  You fucking moan.  Way to go.  There you go, Sal.  Jesus, Sal.  Boom.  You're pausing after they get back to...  We're pausing on our daughters.  That one on the right is fucking smoking.  Smoking.  See, I like the one on the left.  No.  Yeah, I like them both.  I like the one on the left.  The one on the right is so much hotter than the one on the left.  I agree.  Completely doable.  I think there's...  I think there might be two fathers involved.  Right?  Because they're...  Wow.  That chick is fucking hot.  The one on the right has full lips. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  The one on the left is...  She's 14 years old.  Oh, no.  They're young.  That's right.  I don't know how old they are.  No, that fucking old bat is fucking...  It's gotta be above, like, what?  45?  25?  She's...  Oh, thank you.  What the hell is...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  This is interesting.  What is that?  I don't know.  Tums?  Huh?  You need Tums.  Ant needs Tums today.  What's the matter?  A little.  I don't know.  I was driving in, and now it's not bothering me.  When I was driving in, I was kind of a little... 
[00:49:30]  I had some...  Burpee?  I had some...  Jizz.  Some Vincents.  You can't pause on this show.  Some Jizz.  Some Vincents Italian last night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm still tasting that shit.  Nice.  You get reflex?  I get bad reflex.  I'll bet if I...  Not anymore.  If I have a lot of a spicy sauce or something.  Not anymore.  I haven't had acid reflux in a year and a half at least.  What did you say?  I think it was the coffee.  I don't know.  I think I was drinking way too much coffee.  Oh, yeah.  Why would you...  And I don't stress as much.  I just said, fuck it to stress.  That's what I say. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah?  Fuck it to stress.  Fuck it to stress.  Oh, another T-shirt.  You say fuck it to stress.  Oh, thank you.  Let me write that down.  No.  We're trying to build a T-shirt factory because we can't...  Fuck it to stress.  We can't keep up with the orders.  My guy fucking panicked on me and I think he ran away.  I got to find somebody else and take off.  He panicked.  He couldn't fill the orders.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  We sold like too many of those dumb shirts.  I had no business selling as many as I did. 
[00:50:30]  So, no.  I like this guy.  Kelly is cool.  We're just trying to figure it out.  My guy had no problem keeping up with the orders.  Oh, really?  There's a lot of time running our house.  We didn't have a catchphrase.  It's all about using your own handwriting.  Catchphrase.  I realized.  Are we going back to that thing?  All right.  All right.  That's her hot daughters.  Man.  Hi.  Wow.  Ellen's fucking drooling.  Do you understand how cool your mom is?  I mean, she's a YouTube star.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, we've known how cool she is for a while.  But I'm so happy that others get to see it now.  Aw.  She's so positive and so deserving of this.  Yeah.  I'm so happy that we're here.  We all love you so much.  I wish you were.  And I don't get to tell her enough.  So, I'm glad we can bring her out here and show her to the world how awesome she is.  Aw.  Yeah, you are awesome.  I want to know why the daughters look so different.  Yeah.  Well, she's high for an older woman then.  But was she having some fun in some of these cities?  Maybe.  Look at us trying to knock her down.  Yeah.  It's just a nice piece, right?  That when you travel... 
[00:51:30]  Um...  Boxers?  Well...  Someone's bringing her out.  I ran up and brought her a piece of luggage.  I love it!  Why would she love luggage?  I was going to watch Ellen on it with Ellen's dumb picture.  It's terrible.  Well, Ellen is going with that.  I was a joke.  Of course.  Ellen isn't that bad.  Oh, gosh.  First of all, you have Beats headphones.  Oh, Beats headphones.  Nice.  Vaginal and anal beads.  Yay!  Ellen underwear.  Yeah, Ellen socks. 
[00:52:00]  Ellen socks.  Yeah, Ellen, my book, my CD.  Yay!  Yay!  Wow.  Ellen do-go.  Thank God.  Oh, my God.  It's got bosses act coming out of this.  And a pillow.  This is awesome.  And a blanket.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, this is awesome.  Thank you.  You have a $1,000 Visa gift card.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Wow.  Don't try over $1,000.  Yeah.  It's a lot of money for peasants.  $3,000 JC Penney.  Oh.  $3,000 Target.  Oh, okay.  $4,000.  Oh, Radio Shack. 
[00:52:30]  Hell, you're going to buy in Radio Shack for $4,000.  The entire exchange.  Yeah.  A lot of shitty batteries.  I couldn't think of companies.  Oh, now the daughters are on the...  God damn.  Let's see, our legs.  I don't think this is working.  I'll be honest.  What's the matter?  I don't think it's working.  The segment?  I just realized how much our listeners must hate our guts for this.  Yes.  And you're not wrong.  I don't think it's working.  No.  We're watching Ellen.  No.  This is a throwaway story.  I don't think this is working.  Jesus Christ.  It's true.  I literally forgot we were on the air. 
[00:53:00]  We're watching Ellen.  I did too.  I just wanted to see the daughters now that they're up on the stage.  I think we got distracted by the daughters.  We did.  We did.  I think we were ready to tap out and then the one daughter was pretty smoking.  Yeah.  You're right.  We're watching Ellen on the radio.  How awful.  How awful.  How cool your mom is.  And you have a brother, but he couldn't be here because he's studying and he didn't  want to fail.  It's a very important exam.  Sure.  So that's more important.  Wow.  Holy shit.  We haven't yet.  You're smoking.  And where does he go to school?  Tarleton State in Stephenville, Texas.  Good boy.  And I know you're a single mom and you have been raising all three kids on your own and 
[00:53:30]  they want to continue their education and say you're working hard to do that.  I bet you're right.  There's two pilots.  And you're traveling and doing a lot.  I think something's gone.  It's a whole lot for you.  She's only been a stewardess for seven years, supposedly.  Oh.  They just gave her...  What'd they give her?  ...their education and they are working hard to do that.  And you're traveling and doing a lot.  And it's a lot for you.  It's a whole lot for you.  So our friends at Shutterfly want to give you $10,000. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  10 G's.  What the fuck?  I make YouTube videos.  10 G's.  Where's my 10 G's from Shutterfly?  Shutterfly.  Thank you.  See how you get the sponsors to do shit?  Oh, right.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Thank you.  They just throw money around like it's nothing.  And we got, what, three shitty sponsors.  Oh, they're great.  I mean, of course they're great.  But, you know, Steven Singer loves when we call them shitty and all that. 
[00:54:30]  That, like, look at that little nothing, like a boring flight attendant thing.  But she's a pretty good interviewer and she got something out of it.  Sure.  And then they want to just give them shit.  Yeah, it makes her look good.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not saying we should do that with the flight attendant, but maybe the daughters.  Yeah.  Wow.  I can't tell you how much it means to us.  Oh, right.  She made a dumb video.  More than anyone in this world.  She does deserve it.  Thank you.  I can't tell you a little bit about it.  And it's a lot to be a single mom and to raise these amazing kids who are doing very  well.  They're doing real, real well.  That one's really hot. 
[00:55:00]  They're all crime.  They're all nice people.  What the fuck?  Ooh, I want to eat the hiney of that one in the middle.  So tall and awkward.  Come here, you six foot eight fucking monstrosity.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  I hope they're not underage.  I'm going to feel fucking shitty.  Nah.  I think they're in college.  Okay, good.  Who knows?  I don't know.  They cleaned up adults.  You know what I mean?  So they look fine.  Who knows?  But I mean.  Wow.  Give her a smooch right where the tinkle comes out. 
[00:55:30]  It's everything Ellen was saying.  The point being, we said it should be on Ellen.  She was on Ellen.  There she is.  We didn't need to spend 15 minutes.  I know, right?  We literally just watched an Ellen segment like fucking girls.  A bunch of bitches in this room.  Four middle aged women watching Ellen.  We're swooning over Ellen.  Four broads.  I was just Ellen having a nice interview.  Yeah.  There was nothing funny about it.  No.  I do find Ellen funny.  I got to be honest with you. 
[00:56:00]  Did you like Ellen DeGeneres' stand up there, Jimmy?  Yes.  She's funny.  She's a good, I remember when, I think we've talked about this, but years ago, when she  came out in a young comedian special and she had on like kind of, like a Brian Regan-ish  type, but like, you know, boyish.  Right, right, yeah.  Like the tucked in blousey eighties.  Yeah.  And, uh, and she was funny.  I remember she, she was doing something about doing, singing into a hairbrush and I can't  remember it, but back then I remember enjoying her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before I did stand up.  Yeah.  It was about the same time as like Paula Poundstone though, right?  Sure. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Those two got like confused.  Well, I confused them.  Paula Poundstone got very confused for a while.  Did she?  Oh boy.  Yeah.  She, uh, she, uh, had a hobby on the side.  Oh.  Whatever happened with that?  She's, she's good now.  Stepdaughters or whatever.  Oh.  There's some weird allegations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some allegations of some, uh.  Alligators.  Some touching, I believe.  Paula is really odd looking in there.  She looks like Tiny Tim.  Is she funny?  I don't remember.  I never got into Paula Poundstone.  No. 
[00:57:00]  I remember one bit she did that I thought was funny about something about committing suicide.  Yeah.  But it was in a public garage.  So she had a car running and someone left and came back an hour later and she was still  sitting there waiting.  That's, I don't even remember that.  Yeah.  What the jokes were.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  What else is going on?  Wow.  That was supposed to be, uh, that was supposed to be maybe four minutes.  I know.  Yeah.  We got carried away.  We would, if, if she didn't bring those goddamn daughters with her, we wouldn't have,  uh, gone that deep, but.  I'm just cutting the haters off at the pass. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  What are you gonna do?  I'm acknowledging that that was supposed to be four minutes.  Okay.  Relax.  Relax.  Relax.  All right.  Uh, do you have the Chris Christie video?  There's so much to do today, but this Chris Christie, your boy, Chris Christie, I gotta tell  you, I don't like this guy.  I don't even.  I don't like this guy.  He comes across extremely, uh, pompous.  Yeah.  And he's just an asshole when it comes to this marijuana issue.  And I'm not a, I'm not a marijuana guy. 
[00:58:00]  I'm not, I'm not a marijuana guy.  No, no, no.  I dipped a couple of times in the last year.  Oh, a little dipping.  Sure.  Once on Rogan's podcast and once at a Pearl Jam show.  Oh, but I'm, I'm not a smoker by any stretch of the imagination.  But basically he's saying that, um, he will never allow marijuana use in New Jersey and  it is medically proven to be bad.  I don't know about that, but.  So my point is this, and it's very, very simple.  If he feels that way about marijuana, why, why doesn't he ban alcohol in his state? 
[00:58:30]  Well, go, go try to take that one on.  Well, if you.  And alcohol is way worse than marijuana.  If you watch a boardwalk empire, you realize that, uh, banning alcohol in Jersey and the  rest of the country, not that good an idea.  No, of course.  And I, and I don't want it banned.  Yeah.  But you know, you just sound like an asshole.  Yeah.  Well, what, what was the other thing you said to me, um, about this, um, overeating? 
[00:59:00]  No, what'd you say?  Well, Anthony said, what about, uh, gambling?  Oh, gambling.  Compulsive overeating.  Right.  Right.  Jersey loves their casinos.  Sure.  Oh yeah.  There's no argument to be made that that's a detrimental to people.  Sure.  To people's lives.  But he ignores that of course.  Right.  Yeah.  But the, but the weed.  But the weed is the problem.  That's, that's a problem.  What's the, what's the clip?  Can we see that really fast?  I wanted to talk to you about legalizing marijuana.  I've heard you speak on it before.  Um, there's pros and cons with everything, but I just feel legalizing marijuana. 
[00:59:30]  Sounds like a, what's her name?  Lydia.  Lydia.  Yes.  You, it creates industry.  It creates jobs.  It creates, um, money revenue.  Look at California.  Look at Colorado.  What they've done.  Yeah.  Well, money they have.  Let me just stop you right there.  You say it's going to come down the road.  You know when it may come down the road?  When I'm gone.  It's not going to come while I'm here.  There's a new study out in the journal of neuroscience.  It just came out this past week. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  That says that even casual marijuana smokers showed significant abnormalities in two vital  brain regions, important in motivation and emotion.  Some of these people only use marijuana to get high once or twice a week.  The coauthor was quoted in the Northwestern University science news line.  They hailed the study as the first to analyze the effects of light marijuana use.  People think a little recreational use shouldn't cause a problem if someone's doing okay with  work or school.  Our data directly says this is not the case. 
[01:00:30]  The study raises a strong challenge to the idea that casual marijuana use isn't associated  with bad consequences.  I am not going to be the governor who is going to tell our children and our young adults  that marijuana use is okay because it's not.  And it's now being medically proven by the Journal of Neurosciences that it's not even  in casual occasional use.  So I don't care about the tax money that may come from it and I don't care quite frankly  that people think it's inevitable. 
[01:01:00]  It's not inevitable here.  I'm not going to permit it never as long as I'm governor.  You want to elect somebody else who's willing to legalize marijuana and expose our children  to that gateway drug and the effects it has on their brain.  You'll have to live with yourself if you do that.  But it's not going to be this government.  All right.  Then take on alcohol.  Everything you said about marijuana.  Eating.  Right.  Recreational alcohol use certainly causes some issues and problems.  Everything from medical problems to car accidents.  Many car accidents. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  That's why pretty much all of us know somebody that died from, you know, drinking and driving.  And I don't care about the tax money.  Well, we do.  We're the ones paying the tax.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't care about where he's coming from.  Shouldn't he do what his, uh, he's a representative.  Constituency.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not what you want.  It's what the, the, the people that elected you want.  Oh, what a pompous fuck he is.  Uh, go ahead, Kenny.  Kenny.  Marijuana was the catalyst to a cop getting shot in New Jersey yesterday. 
[01:02:00]  Oh yeah.  How did that figure?  Garfield.  It was a buy and bust.  A buy and bust for weed.  Yeah.  I don't think the pot had anything to do with the savage animal that decides he's going  to shoot at fucking police officers.  Drugs are the root of most of the crime.  Well, that was legal though.  They wouldn't have been a buy and bust.  That's true.  Well, you could control it a little bit.  It wouldn't have been.  Yeah.  That's true.  Hey, believe me.  Uh, I don't think the majority of pot users are, um, shooting at cops. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  I don't associate that one with violence.  No.  I would take booze off the market before pot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But booze is way worse.  Exactly.  He's not going to acknowledge that though.  Why would he?  There's too much money that is brought in, uh, with booze.  Let's say hi to Remy in Missouri.  Remy.  Yeah.  The study that Chris Christie was talking about showed that there was abnormalities in  certain parts of the brain, but the study never concluded whether or not those abnormalities  were, uh, disadvantageous.  He, if he, I don't know. 
[01:03:00]  See, Chris Christie is probably just getting like, he doesn't, he seems like he's being  at least genuine.  Right.  He's just getting data handed to him.  Right.  Like they all do.  Yeah.  And someone is telling him, look, you're, you're right to be against it.  Look at this study shows.  And then he's throwing in that morality shit with like, I'm not going to do anything.  Then the children of, oh, shut up.  Well, I would hope he would at least ask our politicians to do a little bit of research  before making up their decision.  Yeah.  That would be nice. 
[01:03:30]  Well, and like Anne said, represent the people.  Yeah.  What do the people of New Jersey want?  And I can't stand legislation for adults that's based on your idea of what children  need.  Right.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  It's always the way it is with like the FCC when they were trying to clamp down on, on  everything as far as entertainment went because the children might see something.  Fuck you.  You don't have children.  So no, I don't should actually, that's right.  Actually, you know, I got to, and I completely agree with you. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Completely agree with you.  Legislate based on all fucking kids.  I'll try to handle that.  I'll try to, you know, decide what he's going to watch on TV.  Right.  And all that shit.  It's an excuse that people give.  It's like, well, they feel it's an inarguable argument that they're putting out.  Like, well, what about kids?  It's just another way they're making their point.  Uh-huh.  It's just another little bullet in the arsenal.  They don't, you know.  Now, if you pop up an opposing viewpoint, you are against kids being raised in a nice, wholesome atmosphere. 
[01:04:30]  That's what they'll come at you with if you try to debate his little fucking topic.  Yeah, adults shouldn't have to sacrifice their own entertainment because the children will be affected.  Or anything.  Their occupations, their lifestyle.  Right.  It's always about the children.  Fuck you.  Ugh.  Hate that.  Raise your own kids.  Raise your own kids.  Yeah.  Bye to TJ in Jersey.  TJ.  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning. 
[01:05:00]  Good morning.  Uh, you know, fuck Chris Christie, the fat bastard.  You know, his gateway drug is fucking donuts.  Oh, shit.  Imagine how big he would be if he was smoking dope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Yeah!  But you know what?  What kind of example is he setting for children?  Right.  Apparently the surgery, the lap band, and he's still obese.  Oh, he's not.  Is that a healthy example to set?  I don't think so.  No, of course not.  He's talking about setting examples.  Oh.  People are looking at you every day, so maybe you should actually really, really drop the 
[01:05:30]  weight and live a healthy lifestyle.  Really, you fat fuck.  That would, that would help the children that might be struggling with their own weight.  He turned around and gave me a look.  You weren't talking to him?  No.  You should have been.  I don't care about marijuana, but Christie is the reason why I will never vote for a  rhino as president.  We don't smoke marijuana in New Jersey. 
[01:06:00]  Anyway.  That's a fucking jam.  That's my boy.  What?  Christie.  He's my boy, right?  Well, you know, it's the bit we do, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like him too.  I do like him.  Just not that shit.  I don't know.  He rubs me the wrong way.  He's so fucking pompous.  He's trying to fucking position himself the whole time.  He's just positioning, positioning, positioning. 
[01:06:30]  He's a Republican.  He's lost a lot of his Republican core because of his dealings with Obama and shit like that.  So now he's, what, trying to be morality police?  Trying to come up and go, yeah, oh, good.  Right.  He is a Republican.  We almost forgot.  Vote for him.  Vote for him.  Vote for him.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  I think I would like him a little more if he would just pull his pants down a little.  Oh, those fucking pants.  They are pretty much almost under his nipples.  He is Humpty Dumpty.  Humpty Dumpty's pants came right up to the part on the egg that started getting small 
[01:07:00]  again.  Right.  That's what he does.  Yeah.  It's uncomfortable to see how high his pants are all the time.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's got to be a better way to do that if you're a bigger gentleman than having to  pull your pants way above your belly button.  Way up.  The Fred Mertz.  Yeah, the Fred Mertz.  The Fred fucking Mertz.  It's called the Fred Mertz.  The Mertz.  With his little tie tucked into his belt.  Yeah.  Speaking of Obama, you mentioned him in there. 
[01:07:30]  I certainly did.  Did you see the Donald Trump tweet?  What now?  Trump's tweets are ridiculous.  He's great though.  He should be fired.  Fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Where's the news story for this?  I thought there might have been a news story for this.  No, there's no story.  Sam just pointed it out and I threw it on the prep sheet.  Okay.  No worries.  What did he say?  He tweets about how unprofessional Obama. 
[01:08:00]  You want to guess?  You'll never guess this one.  How unprofessional.  Obama.  Obama.  It's Trump, so you've got to think ridiculous.  Yeah.  Not how unprofessional he is.  Right.  Right.  It's how unprofessional he does something.  That's pretty mundane.  Is it running up and down the steps of the Air Force One?  Salutes?  Nope.  Walks.  Walks.  He just walks silly? 
[01:08:30]  That's racist, by the way.  According to Donald Trump, what is the actual tweet there?  He walks like George Jefferson.  Yes, like George Jefferson.  What's the tweet?  The way President Obama runs down the stairs of Air Force One, hopping and bobbing all  the way, is so inelegant and unpresidential.  Wow.  I honestly did not read that.  That's racist.  I did not read that.  Do not fall, he writes.  What does he say at the end?  Do not fall?  Do not fall!  I don't care about how Obama gets off a plane.  He trots up and down the steps quickly like he's in shape. 
[01:09:00]  Who cares?  Right.  I fucking really am not an Obama fan, and I could give a shit about how he walks up  and down the stairs.  No, you're happy the faster he gets on the plane if it's leaving the country and you're  sadder if he jogs off.  Bon voyage.  Any other good tweets from Trump while we're on his page?  Interesting how President Obama is flying around in a Boeing 747 on so-called Earth Day.  Oh, there you go.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  Where was he going?  Trump is just like, I don't know.  His tweets are very entertaining.  What are you going to say?  I don't think he's really serious most of the time, to tell you the truth.  I almost feel like it's, yeah, I almost feel like it's just, he's really...  He's just fucking around.  Putting over on everybody.  I don't know.  Because how would you run a multi-billion dollar business like him?  And have time to tweet.  And be like that, right?  I don't know.  It's a little kooky. 
[01:10:00]  He's very entertaining.  Yeah.  Donald Trump.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Got a lot.  There he goes.  What?  There he goes.  He's getting off the stairs.  You see him?  Who cares?  He gives a little run thing and his hands kind of swing in front of him a little bit.  Yeah.  He's a trot.  Yeah, yeah.  He's in Asia.  That's where he went.  Oh, yeah?  On Earth Day.  What's he doing there?  Before you go to break, I heard a good knock-knock joke yesterday.  Could I tell it?  Wait, let me get the dumb button here. 
[01:10:30]  I'll have my fingers on the dumb button.  All right.  And I'll say the whole thing.  Like, you don't have to say who's there or anything.  I want to.  That's part of the fun, Kenny.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed a knock-knock joke.  What do you mean you heard a good one?  I don't know.  I enjoyed this one.  All right.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  The police.  What do you want?  We want to talk.  How many are you?  There's two of us.  Then talk to yourselves. 
[01:11:00]  He's enjoying himself.  He's cracking himself up.  Then talk to yourselves.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  It should have been.  It should have been.  First of all, A, that was, it's arguably the worst joke I've ever heard.  It's terrible.  B, it should have been talk to each other.  Right.  Then talk to each other.  Right. 
[01:11:30]  Talk to yourselves.  Why would two men stand outside just mumble to themselves?  It's too weird.  Right.  I wish it was knock-knock who's there, Pistorius.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  I'm Sirius XM.  Sirius XM and The Fox Home present The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Town Hall.  You Spider-Man?  Yeah, I know.  Costume gives away, huh, Max?

Listen to this 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem.  I got this idea.  It might be a little crazy. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early.  Why don't you come on in here, Tippy?  Yeah!  Come on in, Tippy.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Anthony's chair.  Anthony's chair.  Anthony's chair.  Oh, my God.  Tippi.  He's a man.  Tippi, I want you.  Oh, my God.  That damn good news.  You're leaving the room.  This is great news.  I want you to sit.  I'm so damn happy.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair.  Get a big, comfy chair. 
[01:19:00]  Make yourself comfortable, Tippy.  Talk.  Here you go.  There's your mind.  Why don't you try out some of the equipment?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Tippi Tom.  More Tippi Tom.  Sitting at Anthony's seat.  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out, Tippy?  Why don't you try some of the buttons over there? 
[01:19:30]  Just push some of the buttons over there.  What button do you want to put?  Whatever one you want.  It's you, Tom.  I won.  Don't kill Tom.  Is that enough?  No, keep going.  I got no one else to go.  Five, two.  Hold on, hold on, Tom.  One at a time.  I'm trying to do it.  I want two at a time.  I'm thinking, boy.  Four.  Well, let me tell you something, my crud, McFriend. 
[01:20:00]  As far as I go, I'm up there.  I don't care how many day-go-getty-woop-prest-poop-boom-bots come out.  I don't know what works.  It's in the hole.  I won my prize.  Hey, try the bell there, Tom.  Try the bell.  Hold on.  How come Tom doesn't have headphones on?  Oh, Tom, do you want headphones on? 
[01:20:30]  He's running a spray.  Tom should put those headphones on.  He don't need spray.  Yeah, try that.  Try blowing into that.  Yeah, that's funny.  There you go.  Oh, look.  It's Anthony on line three.  Hey, wait, Tom.  Tom.  Take this next call through the bullhorn.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, Tom.  I like the bullhorn.  Yeah, give him the bullhorn.  Here, try the bullhorn out there, Tom.  Well, yeah.  Wait, over there.  Right there.  That's a goddamn good idea.  Right here.  I know that. 
[01:21:00]  What I'm saying is this.  Push the button, Tom.  Here we go.  Yeah, guys.  Push it in and talk.  All right, now, what I'm saying is that I like the bullhorn, and I don't see no bullhorns  around here, and there's no buffalo over here, either.  Take the next call for us, okay?  Yeah, all right.  Who's calling?  No, just go, hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  Get that animal out of my way. 
[01:21:30]  No, the animal's not here now.  I will not, I will not use any of those things again.  I want everything disinfected, the entire side of the studio, and I will not sit in that  house.  Sure, I will buy it.  You're out of business now, buddy. 
[01:22:00]  You're flying.  Opie and Anthony are back.  On Sirius XM.  Ba-da-da-da-da.  Love the Stones.  Sticky fingers, 43 years ago today.  Whoa.  Is that the one with the zipper? 
[01:22:30]  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah.  The zipper album cover.  It used to come with the actual zipper.  Yeah, the zipper.  You could try to find mixed cock in there.  So, what are they saying?  A plane debris found in Western Australia?  They said it was significant.  They were using those weird, not weird words, but those words where they were being very  careful about what they found.  I heard they called it an object of interest. 
[01:23:00]  Object of interest.  It wasn't a tape of this show.  No.  See, get it?  Object of interest.  No, because people would be bored by the tedious nature of our chatter.  Object of boredom.  I guess it washed up on shore.  Yeah.  They're saying the more they look at it, they're not as excited.  Oh, come on.  Because I guess there's rivets, but then there's rivets with plexiglass or something, and they're  like, well, that's not...  That's not how they build a plane.  That's not how they build a plane for the most part, but you never know, because maybe 
[01:23:30]  it's attached to something.  So many false alarms.  So they're excited, but they're not as excited as they continue to look at this significant  piece of debris that washed up on shore.  Debris.  Wow, man.  That is just crazy.  Like we said yesterday, the one thing we're learning is that the ocean is really polluted.  A lot of fucking shit.  A lot of shit in it.  A lot of shit in the ocean just floating around.  This swatting thing is crazy. 
[01:24:00]  This is a new trend.  It's been going on a while, I guess.  It has, right?  Using SWAT teams as a prank?  Yeah.  You call in a situation to the point where the SWAT team shows up.  Oh, but I think the SWAT team was in on the prank.  Hell no.  Oh, okay, okay.  I feel better about that.  No, somebody was playing Call of Duty with somebody else.  Right.  And he got the shit beat out of him.  And I guess there was some taunting going on.  Right.  Which happens in that game. 
[01:24:30]  And then the one guy didn't like the fact that he lost and was taunted.  So somehow he had the other guy's address.  Right.  And called up the cops and said that there's a big gunfight going on at this address.  And they sent the cops over there with weapons drawn, ready for a standoff or something.  And, you know, false alarm.  Those are dangerous.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  You get one wrong move and fucking someone's blasting. 
[01:25:00]  Of course.  Dangerous shit.  And you're liable, too.  If you call it a false report, you're liable if someone's killed on the way by the cops  or the fire department.  Yeah, yeah.  You're the one that gets the fucking murder rap.  Yeah.  But it's not stopping people.  They've been doing this for a while, like you said.  They usually do it with celebrities.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody did it with Corey Feldman, I think.  Corey had?  I think Corey had.  He probably called it in.  I think Corey called in his own.  That was the rumor, that Corey had called in his own.  Oh, really?  Yes, Corey. 
[01:25:30]  I wouldn't put it past him.  No.  Right?  There was a problem.  I guess the cops were outside this kid's door.  The cops tried for 20 minutes to call Raphael to get him to come out.  But he had headphones on and was still glued to his video game console.  He didn't realize anything was going on.  He couldn't hear anything, his brother said.  I told him there's a bunch of cops outside that are looking for you.  Graphics are great.  Can you imagine if you got Call of Duty or did Call of Duty just cranking through the  house, though, as the SWAT team shows up?  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Right? 
[01:26:00]  Can you imagine you're playing Call of Duty and then real cops burst in?  You're like, this fucking game rules.  It's a 3D effect.  Right.  It's amazing.  Yes, Kenny.  Well, you know how it went down.  How did it go down?  The cops knocked on the door and the people said, who's there?  And the cops said, it's the police.  And they said in the house, how many are there?  They said, there's two of us.  How many are there?  So they said, talk to each other.  Much better.  I got you both times. 
[01:26:30]  I got you.  What do you mean you got?  Didn't he say, I got you both times?  Yeah.  Well, I like, wait, how do you say it?  Overdare.  Overdare.  Overdare.  Yeah.  So anything else on that story?  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, it's...  Where did it happen?  Originally, they were arguing.  Long Beach.  Long Island.  Because they were...  Long Beach, New York.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah.  And they had an argument.  It was an in-game argument about what night they were going to see me at Caroline's. 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  I'm not plugging.  It's not about a plug.  But he said Thursday, and then he said Saturday, so...  Yeah.  Friday sold out, huh?  That's just when they wanted to come.  Oh, Jimmy sold out Friday.  Nice.  A lot of racism going on in Call of Duty, though, over the microphones.  A lot of black guys like playing Call of Duty.  Ghosts, I've noticed.  A lot of them.  You know, you fucking log into a game, you just hear like, yeah, motherfucker. 
[01:27:30]  Let's do this different today.  Yeah.  What do they call the white guys?  I don't know.  No one really calls them anything.  Peckwood.  Well, there's a lot of racism, and there's a lot of black guys.  I understand the one angle, but I wonder how they, you know, come back from that.  Oh, it's just white motherfucker.  Stuff like that.  That's what I mean.  Oh, redneck, hillbilly, sister fucker.  That's what I mean.  That's what I'm asking.  Yeah, they go with the hillbilly thing, calling white guys hillbillies and shit like that. 
[01:28:00]  And then, of course, you know, lots of N-bombs being dropped in that game.  That's part of the, part of your loadout.  You know, you could go with a fucking automatic rifle and some N-bombs.  Sal found a video.  Go back.  It's called, I don't know if it's going to work.  I understand.  I don't know if it's real, honestly.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's called Hilarious Black Guys on Call of Duty.  Oh.  I hope it's real. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  Bro, you know what I said, though?  He want to turn up at McDonald's, bro.  An hour after the party over, he want to turn up at McDonald's.  Fuck out of here.  We was like, nigga, you ain't dance on one female.  Yo ass want to drink and shit, smoke and shit.  And now you want to turn up when we at McDonald's because you see a double cheeseburger?  Fuck out of here.  Nigga want to dance on a McDouble.  Yo, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What the hell did you even say?  Come on, get out of the ass, man.  What are you doing?  You said what, bro? 
[01:29:00]  What did you even say?  You said that way too fast.  Get the fucking tags, man.  You said what?  You guys are talking way too fast.  I cannot understand you.  All right, so I went to a party, right?  Yeah.  I went there with my friend, all right?  So he ain't want to dance or nothing, drink, smoke, nothing.  He just sat there the whole party.  So we go to McDonald's.  We go to McDonald's.  He want to start dancing and shit.  He was like, what you dancing for, bro?  It's because he ordered a McDouble.  Like, nigga, we was just at a party.  You ain't want to dance at all.  Now he's at McDonald's.  You want to dance. 
[01:29:30]  Is he fat?  Is he fat?  Is he fat?  No, he ain't fat.  He just, I don't know.  He weird.  He weird.  It's all right.  It's all right.  But that's usually the discussions you'll get.  It's just as inane as that.  I've really just backed off on even putting on the headphones or using the microphone.  Really?  It's useless.  Are people ever rude to each other?  Constantly.  Oh, constantly.  But what about the bullying campaigns?  Eh, that ain't working on Call of Duty. 
[01:30:00]  I'll tell you that much.  They're not working?  Nah.  Are you sure?  Positive.  Do they say racist things?  A lot of racist stuff.  A lot of racist stuff going on on Call of Duty.  I'm surprised you haven't brought up your dream girl and we've been on the radio an hour.  Oh, no.  You know this story?  This woman was made for you.  What is this?  Teen.  Uh-huh.  Everything sounds better when you have teen in it.  Remember, guys, from the old days.  We always said that, sure.  Haven't brought that back in a while.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  You add teen onto anything and it's way better.  Uh-huh.  Cops.  Teen had loaded revolver in her vagina.  Whoa.  And she's quite the looker.  Well, how did that happen?  I'm thinking this might be your dream girl.  That's nice.  A 19-year-old Tennessee woman.  She's a hot little blonde.  See, look at her.  She's white trash all over.  Had a loaded handgun hidden in her vagina when she was brought into jail yesterday afternoon  following a caller for driving with a suspended license. 
[01:31:00]  A little Derringer-looking revolver.  How big is that thing?  That's pretty small.  But, like, what is it?  Yeah, it's no bigger or wider than a cock.  Than a vagina?  Oh, you could easily get it.  See, look at the hand.  Right.  A chick could easily get that up or twit.  Women laugh at that.  That's easy, right?  Oh, yeah, that's nothing.  That's nothing to them.  Yeah.  As Dallas Archer was being booked into the Kingsport Jail, a female corrections officer 
[01:31:30]  alerted to an unknown object in the teenager's crotch during a search.  Oh, boy.  The jailer and a female cop then accompanied Archer to a bathroom for further examination.  Bend over and grab your ankles.  That's right.  A review that led to the recovery of a North American Arms .22LR revolver.  Loaded.  She was loaded.  22?  Which Miss Dallas had concealed in her vagina.  Wait, who's that? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, man, that's sexy.  According to Kingsport Police Department report,  a subsequent check revealed that the five-shot mini revolver,  which is four inches in length,  had been stolen from an auto burglary in 2013.  The handgun, which police valued at blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  Stolen gun in her vagina.  Oh, that's one stinky holster.  That's nice.  I do like that.  Well, what do we got here?  Well.  Well, what do we got here? 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  She's fucking squirreling it up there.  Yeah.  Let me go get my gloves.  I'd have more respect for it if it was a desert eagle.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You're going to have to bend over a little more.  Yeah.  Well.  We're going to have to investigate this.  I see something up there.  Well.  Let me check that out.  What is this?  I best taste it first before we do any further investigating.  I should taste that.  Of course.  We want to be safe.  Make sure there's no explosives up there.  Oh, well, indeed, indeed. 
[01:33:00]  We're going to have a taste test.  Oh.  Oh, boy, are we.  Careful.  I have to reach in and set the safety before we try to remove it.  Right.  We better check the asshole just to make sure.  Yes.  There's no ammo up there for your gun.  That's in your vagina.  Some other weaponry.  That's how I imagine it goes down.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure it's just some fucking mess of a woman.  All right.  Bend over. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Fucking.  Hey, we got something here.  We got something up for snacks.  Yeah.  Right.  Don't move.  Pin her down and fucking pull that shit out.  All right.  We need you to lay on your back, okay?  We're going to spread your legs.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Wow.  I do like that.  Hey, pass the lube.  We don't want to hurt her as we remove this.  A loaded foreign object.  Loaded pistola.  Is that a remote shot? 
[01:34:00]  Badge.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  She's a hot mess, as they like to say.  She's a goddamn...  She's a hot mess.  That is the epitome of the white trash girl.  Right.  The fucking bleach blonde hair.  She just looks like she cuts out of school a lot.  She's got her eye makeup on all fucked up.  Would you?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Let's say...  Fuck yeah.  Hi to Mark in Boston.  Alice Archer.  That's a cool name, too. 
[01:34:30]  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  I wish New York was as strong as you guys.  I got to be honest with you.  You guys know how to handle a situation up there.  What do you got?  Give it six months.  Something will happen in Dallas.  Then we'll all wish we were as strong as those guys down there.  Holla.  This swatting thing's been going on for about two years.  And I know Kent's not a huge fan of Twitchy, because they gave him some shit about Miguel  Maroney.  However, they've been on the forefront of this, because Malkin was swatted.  Eric Erickson, who's on CNN.  Basically, it's anyone who's a leftist activist that doesn't like a talking head that's a right 
[01:35:00]  winger that they know owns guns.  They'll just say, hey, I shot my wife.  You guys better come take a look at this.  And then hang up.  The cops have to go.  And if they know that there's gun owners or whatever there, they have to show up with  guns drawn.  And they're hoping that some right-wing pundit's going to wind up getting shot over them.  Yeah.  You do a Google search for Brett Kimberlin.  That's fucked up.  Right.  He's the guy that originated this.  And it's really fucked up, because that guy was a terrorist.  He did bombing in the 70s. 
[01:35:30]  And he's one of those occupied types.  So he's calling in fake threats to the cops to get a gun owner shot?  Are these guys getting arrested?  Well, yeah.  But, Jimmy, it's not gun owners.  It's like Ann Coulter type.  Like, I don't like you, Ann Coulter, because you're a right-wing shill.  So I'm going to say, hey, Ann Coulter has guns.  I'm going to call it a fake hoax.  And hopefully the SWAT team will wind up shooting her.  What a scumbag.  Yeah, that's...  Who's the scumbag?  And, well, Brett Kimberlin is one person that has been associated with it. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  But it's happened to celebrities, too.  Yeah.  I think Chris Brown's house was SWAT-ed.  He wasn't even home.  I mean, he's a scumbag.  Fuck him.  But, I mean, I don't want to see the kids shot over some asshole calling in a fake, you  know, a fake, you know, murder investigation or something.  So the people calling in these fake threats or whatever, are they getting arrested at least?  Well, that's the thing, Opie, is whoever's doing this or whoever is doing this are smart  enough to use, like, computerized phone lines that are getting bounced from, you know, here 
[01:36:30]  to the back again.  Yeah, it's very hard to trace.  Right.  But you can't trace it.  Wow.  That's so dangerous.  How do you trace those numbers?  I don't think you can.  You can just buy one.  Oh, well, whatever.  Say that again?  You guys have a Russell Simonson later on?  Yes.  Yes.  Can you ask him a question for me?  This is a legitimate question.  I don't think anyone's ever asked him.  Okay.  He's like a bazillionaire, and he was in favor of Occupy Wall Street. 
[01:37:00]  How can a guy who owns a credit card company and is essentially a banker go out and protest  against scumbag bankers when he's a bazillionaire himself?  Russell's a weird guy.  I don't think he was necessarily...  We should ask him that.  That's a pretty good question.  Yeah, that's a good question.  I don't think he was even thinking it through.  It was more like, hey, these guys are fighting power.  Yeah, but Jimmy, he showed up down there, and he was protesting and holding signs with  people.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:37:30]  Maybe I'm wrong then.  Okay.  There's a lot of liberal people that don't do the old practice what they preach, you know?  Sure.  So they're like, yeah, the social cause is, man, we're going to do this.  And then, you know, like Michael Moore, they have giant houses far away from the places  that they supposedly champion, you know?  Exactly.  No one's actually asked him that I've found in the media that can say, all right, hey,  do you stand for X, but you're actually doing Y. 
[01:38:00]  How can you justify that?  Well, Mark, are you going to be around later?  You should ask the question.  I'll be at work listening to you guys on my desk like I do every day.  I appreciate that.  Sounds like a treat.  Take it easy.  All right, we'll try to ask him that.  Thank you.  Later.  It's a book on meditation, and I actually really want to do this because I'm so sick of  not sleeping.  I'm hoping meditation helps.  You think meditation?  I don't know, man.  I've got to try something.  Try the other thing that kind of sounds like that a lot.  See?  Masturbation.  Oh, okay.  That does help, though.  Very well.  It does.  Well, not for Jimmy.  It keeps me awake, no, because I have to keep jumping.  I've been pissing. 
[01:38:30]  Uh-oh.  My stupid prostate starts doing the fucking, the, the, I couldn't think of a dance.  The Watusi?  Yeah, exactly.  I was trying to pick a new dance.  The rumba, the sound of dance.  Meditation made simple.  I meditate a little bit.  I'm not trying to read this thing.  What is that about?  The power of the presence.  You meditate.  It's too quiet.  I know.  I like a little, oh.  The power of the presence.  Oh.  I meditate while watching television.  Can't do that.  I just sit there, quiet, and just watch TV.  You'd be freaked out if you were, you went silent.  I just don't like the quiet. 
[01:39:00]  That's what I'm saying, because.  I hear my own tinnitus.  It's wonderful.  Let's see.  You know, it occurred to me the other day when I was talking about my stupid job fucking  in air conditioning and heating.  Right.  That, I bet part of my tinnitus problem isn't so much the band as it is sitting there bashing  sheet metal with a hammer.  It just, it's so loud.  Thunderstorms all day long.  That's what it is.  I know.  There's something called a Pittsburgh seam on a duct where it's like, most of the time 
[01:39:30]  you just put like tab A and slot B and fucking bang it together, and it's like very easy.  But this Pittsburgh one is for very heavy gauge duct work for big pieces.  And you got to use this pneumatic hammer.  It fits into a compressor, you know, and you lay it on the sheet metal, and you're supposed 
[01:40:00]  to bend over this little eighth inch flange over the top of the other piece that you slid  in to fasten it.  And it's on this giant piece of sheet metal, and it's going.  It's so fucking loud.  Did you like using it?  I hated that fucking thing more than anything.  And why don't you wear earplugs?  You can't.  Because.  You'll constantly be taking them out of your ears to hear what someone's saying to them.  The safety equipment is, you know.  And I bet your fellow workers would say stuff like, don't be a faggot. 
[01:40:30]  Exactly.  Yes.  If you did wear the earplugs.  Don't be a faggot.  Earplugs.  Oh, is that, is that, is that it?  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, yeah.  That's where you got it.  That's.  It's hammering.  And do you know what that sounds like in, in the shop?  Yes.  When you're trying to make it?  Every girl I've dated.  Yes.  Why do they call it the Pittsburgh Lock?  I would guess that some gentleman.  In Pittsburgh?  In the great city of Pittsburgh. 
[01:41:00]  Willie Stargell?  Said, I'm going to do it this way.  Ah.  And I probably said it, he probably just said, hey, you need a flange over there.  Over there.  Over there.  We got to put this together.  Over there.  That's the Chicago.  Yeah, it was just a loud, and then when you want to cut a hole in a duct, let's say you  want to cut a fucking hole in there for an outlet, you take a screwdriver, you put  it against the fucking duct, and you hit that with a hammer to rip a tear in the sheet 
[01:41:30]  metal so you get your snips in there.  So that's more.  Did you get cut a lot?  A lot.  You did.  Oh, I got cuts all over.  I got scars all over my hands.  Right.  Yeah.  The sheet metal?  Yeah.  Oh, I would have hated that.  Like, you grab it and you feel, and then you go like, oh, oh, you close your hand real  tight, and you go, uh-oh, uh-oh, and then you look and go, yeah, that's stitches.  How many times did you get stitches?  Uh, probably three.  Bitches get stitches.  Oh, you got stitches in your fucking hands.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Probably three times from work, but so many more.  You'd cut yourself, you only got stitches if you really needed it, because usually you'd  cut yourself, take some duct tape, just wrap it, take a napkin, slap it over the fucking  wound, duct tape it up, and get the fuck back to work.  Because it was a clean slice.  Yeah.  Those you could push back together pretty easily.  Another real bad one was, um, uh, these hanging ceilings like this.  Right.  Usually when we came in, these weren't in yet.  Right.  The hanging ceiling.  Because the ductwork has to go above it.  Right. 
[01:42:30]  So, uh, sometimes, though, they would prep the ceiling.  Every corner you see, pretty much, there's a wire that comes down.  They look beautiful.  And they hang this ceiling from these wires.  Right.  But before they hang it, the wires are a lot longer, and then they clip them to size after  they fasten it.  So they're hanging down.  These very sharp wires are hanging down.  And I was climbing up a ladder once, and one got me right in the shoulder, and just stuck  right in me, in my shoulder.  Whack. 
[01:43:00]  Like, ow!  Poof!  Pulled down, and there it was.  A big hole in my shoulder.  Are you bleeding?  Oh, yes.  I went home that day, angry.  Then there's another one where you have your 25-foot extension ladder, and you gotta lean  it against a ceiling joist in, like, a factory, and it's just about hitting the joist, like,  25 feet up.  Oh, my God.  And you gotta climb it, and it's shaking, and then you're leaning off of it a little bit  over to one side, going, I'm gonna die. 
[01:43:30]  Were you ever nervous?  I was sometimes shaking.  Shaking.  Because then you put a drill screw in your little drill bit thing, and now you gotta put  pressure on it as you're trying to drill screw into the ceiling decking.  So you're pushing down on a ladder that you're leaning off of, and sometimes the drill screw  would go, like, snap out of the bit, and you would, like, it would jostle you one way  or another.  No, but I came close.  One time, the ladder actually slipped down a little bit. 
[01:44:00]  How high up were you?  Like, slipped down about 20 feet.  Were you scared?  Petrified.  Petrified.  Oh, it was so scary.  Isn't there a way to stop that?  I would hate to climb a ladder like that.  Well, you're supposed to fasten it.  There's a lot of safety things you're supposed to do, but it just takes too much time.  It's bad, but no one does them.  Fasten it with what, from the top to the joist?  Yeah, you're supposed to tie it off to the joist.  When you're trying to get on a rooftop, you extend the ladder a good, at least two feet 
[01:44:30]  above the top of the roof, so you have a handle when you step onto the roof.  But a lot of times, you don't have that.  Right.  You're barely on there, on the roof, and then you're supposed to tie it off on something  up on the roof, so the ladder doesn't fall over.  You don't do that.  What do you do when you're getting down, and there's just a little...  I had that when I was a kid, trying to climb out of something, and there was a little teeny  lip, so you got to kind of like hang on to something and put your feet over the hedge.  It's so scary. 
[01:45:00]  It's so fucking scary.  I would just yell, help.  I am so glad I don't have to do that anymore.  Why did you get into the duck work?  It was the only unskilled labor I could get.  I went from being a guy that installed above-the-ground pools to the tin-knocker sheet metal guy.  Why did you give up the pool business?  It was very seasonal, and there was no pay at all.  It was terrible.  I'm so glad.  If you're going to do above-ground pools, or any pools, you don't want to do it here. 
[01:45:30]  No.  You should have moved to Florida.  It sucked, too.  For more work.  That job sucked.  Most jobs sucked.  Yes!  That one just sounds awful, though.  You were in constant fear for your life.  Isn't above-ground pools easier, though?  Just dig a big fucking area out?  All right, that's good.  Yeah.  I would think.  They used to get these giant trucks, these boom trucks, with the big boom and the cable.  To lift these giant air conditioning units, I like the size of freight trains, onto the roofs of these factories and stuff. 
[01:46:00]  And you'd be standing there, underneath the unit.  Like, all right, prep the unit.  And you'd have to take off the-  You've heard that before, didn't you?  Prep the unit.  Except the unit was something else.  Bull.  Yeah.  I know.  Yes.  But you'd have to take these temporary, like, covers off of the intake and exhaust of these units.  And so they're dangling like that. 
[01:46:30]  That's exactly one.  They dangle these fucking units, and you'd have to be underneath this.  It's just precariously perched above you on a cable.  You're just trusting everyone did the right job, and that's your life.  You think anyone ever got hurt doing that?  Oh, I bet.  I bet a lot of people got hurt.  That's crazy.  It was terrible.  Could you write up on the top of that?  I'm sure it would hold it.  Yeah, there were people that would do that right up on the unit. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It's bringing back great memories.  Everybody wants to say hi.  Dee in Minnesota.  Dee.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Dee.  I'm so nervous right now, so forgive me.  That's all right.  What's up, Dee?  My name is Dean from Brainerd, actually.  Oh, Brainerd.  Yeah, come on up.  I've got a damn thing you can see in.  Babe, the Blue Ox.  Yep, Paul Bunyan.  And they thought you were just talking about setting rooftops.  That's what I'm setting today. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  You know, and actually, when I listened to you on math, I actually weeped when you were  talking about how you threw your sheet metal tools out on the road.  Right out there on, yes, right out on 95 as I drove up.  Did you?  Yep.  You threw all your stuff on the right out the fucking window.  It's like, eh, could always buy new ones.  A pair of jeans are $40, and a pair of crimpers are $45, you know, these days.  Crimpers?  Some of us can't crimpers.  I know.  I would usually just, I would try to just trim down my equipment so I didn't have to 
[01:48:00]  carry so much, so I would just use needle-nose pliers to crimp clinch collars with.  What's crimping that mean?  Yeah, so you could slide a piece of pipe into another piece of pipe of the same diameter.  You'd have to crimp the other one.  What does that mean?  Open the hole?  That means I'd kind of close it down a little bit.  You'd have to put little creases all around the diameter so you could slide it in.  Yeah, it's like putting a foreskin on the fucking thing. 
[01:48:30]  It's like putting your dick into another man's foreskin.  Comment, Sal.  Comment.  Not really.  All right, D, you survived.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kyle in Boston.  Kyle.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Ed, you ever work in a scissor lift?  Oh, fuck yeah, those are scary shit, too, especially with duct work, because you've got to do a lot of maneuvering and stuff.  And when you're trying to put a slip and drive connection together, and you've got to angle it a little, so you're kind of leaning over the edge of the scissor lift, and it's like going back and forth. 
[01:49:00]  You've seen them in the lobby.  Yeah, look at one right now.  Oh, right, right.  So you're up there about 20 feet, and the fucking thing's going back and forth.  Yeah, those get a little creepy, too.  So scaffolding, I wasn't a big fan of either.  The Time Warner building, when you walk in there, they have some great restaurants, but there's like an overhang.  And in the very entrance, it goes all the way up to the, so it's probably 50 feet, I would say.  Oh, no, even higher.  In that lobby, 70 feet. 
[01:49:30]  At least.  And they have these giant banners that hang down, and they use those scissor lifts to get up and hang the Christmas banners or whatever.  They look fucking horrifying.  It's very, when they're up really high.  And then sometimes, you'd want to go down to the next piece of duct, because the ducts are usually 8 feet long.  So you'd have to go to the next one.  And you didn't want to waste the time of lowering the scissor lift all the way down, driving it 8 feet and lifting it back up.  So you would actually drive, which you're never supposed to do, drive it as it's elevated up 20 feet. 
[01:50:00]  Like really slow, just try to edge it along.  That's crazy.  It's very top-heavy at that point.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I tipped one of those over one time at a job site.  I was rocking it, trying to get a move, and then I had an apprentice up there with me that was petrified.  So I had to puck it with him, rocking back and forth real hard.  Yeah.  And I got it bouncing wheel to wheel, and then we went too far one way.  Luckily, there was an I-beam that caught us at like a 45-degree angle. 
[01:50:30]  I almost killed the fucking...  No horseplay.  No horseplay.  Anyway, it's amazing how those things can be stopped by one drill screw on a floor, though.  Really?  Yeah.  You drive it, and all of a sudden, beep, it just stops dead.  Like, what the fuck is in my way?  A drill screw.  I was on a scissor lift about 800 feet in the air one time.  It's impossible, Chip.  No, you weren't.  Oh, shit, are those dead guys?  Whoa.  How high was that?  Not very high.  Fort Lauderdale scissor lift accident.  The platform toppled.  Jesus.  Is that the top part, the platform? 
[01:51:00]  It looks like the whole thing tipped over.  Wow, that's fucked up.  The platform would be on the bottom, right?  Whoops.  I don't know.  What's it called, the thing you stand on?  Let's say hi to Steve in Central Jersey.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, listen, man.  I'm just sitting on my 40-foot ladder now, and usually you never even think about these  things.  Yeah.  After listening to you this morning, like, I know it's going to be windy as shit today.  Oh, tie it off.  The ladder's up against the gutter, moving around a little bit. 
[01:51:30]  So I'm thinking, you've been there 20 years now, right?  Isn't that like a cop?  20 years, you could just retire?  Yeah, I know, right?  Retire.  What are you supposed to?  Step right in.  I'm a funny buck.  Oh, so you could take over the gig.  Yeah.  Another tin knocker.  Hey, what are you supposed to tie that to at that height on the roof?  What will you tie it to?  I tie up the trees.  You know, usually it's a tree, because that's the only thing close enough.  On a roof, you could use a vent pipe sometimes, or you could, if it's really got stout gutters, 
[01:52:00]  you could, like, vice grip it to a gutter.  Vice grip your ladder?  Yeah, you just fucking click and then click and clamp it on.  Whatever you can do.  Yeah, whatever you can do.  The Brunswick's love you, Jimmy.  The Brunswick's love you.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Yeah.  Hey, Adam, have you ever used a Weezer Foggle?  What the hell is a Weezer Foggle?  I think he's being...  Oh, okay.  Facetious.  I did. 
[01:52:30]  You scared me.  I think he's being facetious.  Let's go to Shane in Charlotte.  Shane.  Hey, I'm a workers' comp insurance adjuster, and hearing the way you've been talking about  skipping some of these safety things makes me cringe.  I get pictures all day long of blood-stained and impaled people from doing the same things  you're talking about.  It's nasty business.  That's true.  We used to...  When me and my brother worked in the shop over a true mechanical, we'd go out for lunch  and just go to the bar next door.  We'd bet the horses from an OTB that was right next to the bar, and then we'd sit there and 
[01:53:00]  drink, and then go back into a shop full of machines, custom-built, to chop your limbs  off.  There's something called a pneumatic brake, and this thing would bend 90-degree angle  bends in sheet metal.  So you'd make a square duct with it, you know?  You'd mark off where you want it to bend, and you'd put it in there, and then you hit  the foot pedal, and this big blade comes down and just goes, duck-unk, and bends it.  And then you've got to fucking jockey it around. 
[01:53:30]  But that is just custom-made to fucking chop your fingers off, especially drunk.  We'd have a good buzz.  The whole shop would go and drink.  You think anyone ever got hurt using that?  I bet a lot of people have...  Fuck them.  There it is.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's dangerous.  You'd be amazed at the way these people can hurt themselves.  Yeah.  It's almost impossible to dream of what these people do.  Amazing.  To tear their bodies apart.  I've watched so many factory videos on, like, you know, these sites of people who, like, 
[01:54:00]  hands caught in this, and machinery, where their hand looks like just a piece of meatloaf.  That's called degloving.  That's one of the worst injuries there.  Degloving.  Wow.  What's degloving?  The skin pulls off of your hand all the way like you're taking a glove off.  And you're just left with a skeleton hand?  Mostly tendons and muscle.  Oh, my God.  We're looking at one now.  A degloving injury.  What do they got there?  Wow.  It's, like, pulled? 
[01:54:30]  What the hell?  The skin is pulled off of the...  I don't know what that is.  Normally, the kind of machine that'll do that, there's no way to get that skin back on your  hand because it grinds it and crushes it up so much.  So you basically have to get skin grafts from your legs, and it takes years.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Myofacial degloving?  Come on.  I want to see that.  It's a great name.  Yeah.  All right.  I like a de-socking.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  That guy's...  Jesus.  The skin just came right off of his fingers. 
[01:55:00]  Myofacial degloving.  Skeleton hand.  You'd think you'd have the frame of mind to, right when that happens, to just go to  your co-worker and go, boo.  Like, boo.  Scary.  A little joke.  A little levity.  Probably not.  No, I don't think so.  You'd probably be like...  You'd say what I said when I went to the hospital.  Pray for me.  Oh, did you say that?  When I had a head injury from a baseball hitting me.  What?  My head split open and they called the ambulance because I was bleeding profusely and I was  a little woozy, so as they were carrying me out on the stretcher, I think I said to 
[01:55:30]  my parents, pray for me.  Ew!  Who says that?  I did.  Little Jimmy.  Yes, I did.  How old were you?  13, 14.  Pray for me.  Yeah.  Not a good...  Did your dad just look up in the air and go, fuck.  Yeah.  He's probably like, look, I know your lifestyle.  There goes my daughter.  Hello, guys.  This is the real deal from Howard and I'm glad I did.  Y'all are all.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, brother.  Let's say hi.  Oh, man. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  This guy's been in the trade for 30 years.  Freddie in Orlando, Florida.  Freddie.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Listen, I'm retired now, but I was in the AC trade.  I used to run the line sets, purge the lines.  I used to work in the attics.  And those lines...  All right, feed it through.  Feed it.  Hold it.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Hold up.  All right.  Bring it through.  Bring it through.  Yeah, yeah.  Yelling, yeah.  Those fucking lines set to the residential when they had that John's man go, that pig 
[01:56:30]  panther fucking fiberglass insulation.  Yes.  Do you remember that first week on the job?  I didn't know to wear long sleeves.  That shit makes you itch.  And the worst thing, this is weird.  Put mustard on it, that shit.  I got a problem with public restrooms.  I don't know what you all did, but back in the day, we didn't have porta potties.  We had to carry around five-gallon paint buckets to take a dump in.  I've talked about the spackle bucket dumps that everybody had to take.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  No bathrooms.  But yeah, that insulation was so bad.  And sometimes you'd show up to a job and, yeah, it was the summer.  You'd be wearing short sleeves and realize, oh, fuck, I got an attic job today.  And it would hurt.  You'd feel like you had little pins in you for days.  You'd feel it.  And it was fiberglass just shoved into your pores.  From reaching your arms through it?  Yeah, you'd have to because there's no safe.  You can't just delicately put the ductwork.  You're ripping fucking insulation. 
[01:57:30]  The dust is, like, filling the attic in the air.  We'd wear a mask, a respirator mask, but you'd get it all down your back.  Was it hot in that mask?  Oh, was it?  Fuck it.  Sometimes it would get so wet you couldn't even breathe through it.  It was just soaked in sweat.  Terrible.  I have a story, too.  While you were doing that, I was trying to figure out the proper way to, like,  say get Jethro Tull song into a Yes song.  I just couldn't get it quite right for so long. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, boy.  I have your answer, by the way, how you do that.  Oh, oh.  That was Jethro Tull.  Do you like them?  Yes.  Oh!  You want to try it?  Let's try it.  Oh, I just heard a moan of pleasure from down the hall.  Who could that have been?  I think Denny would have liked that one.  Let's say hi to Jeff in New Hampshire.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jeffy.  Yeah, I do heating and air conditioning.  And one of my accounts is called Road to Responsibility.  And they have mentally handicapped adults that they have a house in for them. 
[01:58:30]  And they bring them into these places that they have to work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they have, like, 30 of these people in, like, a little warehouse.  And they do packaging and, like, menial jobs.  Oh, of course.  So I was working in there with a 10-foot stepladder.  And I had to run out to my truck.  And while I was gone, one of the guys climbed the ladder and sat at the top and started to 
[01:59:00]  cry because he couldn't come down.  And the fire department had to come.  Come on.  From a 10-foot ladder?  10-foot stepladder.  He climbed all the way up and just sat on the top.  Oh, jeez.  And they were like, come on, come down.  You know, you've got to come down.  And he started to cry.  And he wouldn't come down.  He was afraid.  He was, like, turning around.  And I'm trying not to laugh.  Yeah.  Right.  It ended up being, like, an hour.  The fire department had to come in with two other ladders, set them up on either side,  and go up and carry the guy down.  I've got a 322, a dummy on a ladder. 
[01:59:30]  Get the fuck down off my stepladder.  My stepladder.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe on Long Beach.  Hey, what's up, Anthony?  Yeah.  I just wanted to know if you remember getting stuck in the hand by installing duct pins  on the ductwork, the way insulation.  Oh, yeah.  Those pins.  On that little pin machine?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You put the insulation on top of it, and you get stabbed in the hand.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Sometimes the insulation would go, like, inside the duct, so there'd be this glue that you'd  have to put on.  That was another thing, the fucking glue.  This stuff smelled like you knew it was toxic in any fucking form.  And you're there spraying this blue fucking goopy glue on so the insulation could stick  on the inside of the duct, and then it would go in this machine that, like, put these  pins in to fasten it on, and you're just breathing it in and getting dizzy.  Oh, how do people do this job for any length of time without just dying or being retarded? 
[02:00:30]  How long did you do this?  Probably from, let me think, 86.  80?  From 86 to 94.  Nice.  There you go.  That was about it.  Did you ever get glue on yourself?  All the time.  And when it got into the crease in my elbow, like, like, and it would go, when you moved,  oh, it was terrible.  You'd have to go in and use, like, the goop, the goop stuff with the pumice in it to clean 
[02:01:00]  up at the end of the day.  Now I understand why you didn't want me to blow it up.  Oh, when, when, when that fucking dead mayor April Fool's thing happened, I was having  all of these flashbacks, like, I'm just going to be back in the glue fucking thing, and back  in the attic, and insulation.  You must have thought, like, radio guys were just sissy boys.  Oh, a bunch of fairy Marys.  Did you ever feel like, um, I don't know, like, Jesus Christ, we're not even working? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I still do.  I do.  The hardest part of this job is getting up in the morning.  That's it.  Oh, man.  I pictured me back with the Pittsburgh joint.  Gah!  Gah!  You and Willie.  Willie Stargell.  Didn't you used to do, gah, what?  I'll try it again, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  This guy, I don't know, he's got fingers or used to, or something.  Ow and Buffalo.  Ow!  Ow! 
[02:02:00]  Hey, how's up, guys?  I used to work in the sheet metal shop where we make conveyors.  And this one kid, first day on the job, we used one of them presses that would cycle.  It wasn't pneumatic.  And you had to run the whole cycle.  You couldn't back it off.  He's pressing bang into the end of these tubes that we use for the conveyors.  Put his fingers right in front of it.  Cut his fingers right off.  Not a drop of blood.  I had to go cut that stupid tube in half and get his fingers out so they could take him  to the hospital.  How many fingers did he lose?  He lost two fingers. 
[02:02:30]  Did they put him back on?  Yeah, they got him back on.  It was such a pinch.  When it pinched a bit, when it buried him in the tube, it pinched it so tight.  You know, cut him right off.  Not a drop of blood come out.  Wow.  Really clean cut.  So it was probably easier to reattach.  Oh, fuck.  That wasn't bad.  But the worst part was cut that goddamn tube open.  Just, you know, shaking it down and getting the fingers out.  And getting the fingers out.  That happened to me once when I was in jail.  My friend wanted to paint, and the warden took his paints, so he chopped his fingers  off, and I had to plink them into a little wooden carrying case. 
[02:03:00]  Where did he get the hatchet from?  Mr. Zimmerman loaned them to him, and he was going to build something.  Oh.  What did you say when you gave the guy, showed the guy the fingers?  Well, I plinked them quietly in, and I handed it to the guard, and I said, here, put this  in your report sheet.  All right.  Ah, that's fucking great. 
[02:03:30]  There's so many more calls.  A lot of safety equipment, too, on these machines was inconvenient.  So things that were meant to shut the machine off if your hand got in there were usually  overridden, so you could just, like, do your job faster or quicker or whatever.  The safety being on there.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we'll take more calls down the road, but got a nice little treat for everybody  after the break.  Oh, is that what he was working on?  Is it in?  A little surprise jock-tober.  Oh, this is fantastic.  A little surprise jock-tober. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  A little show's going to teach us what funny is all about.  Mm-hmm.  And we're going to do that after these messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be right back.

Or listen to it all over again.  The Opie and Anthony Encore starting at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, 8 a.m. Pacific Time, and all throughout the day.  Only here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  It's real.  Opie and Anthony have been creating radio gold for 20 years. 
[02:15:00]  Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history, here's a 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem.  All right.  Let's welcome Steve the Whistler onto the Opie and Anthony show.  And I'm whistling a little to welcome him.  Now, I found out Jimmy Norton, Opie, doesn't know how to whistle.  No, maybe Steve could teach a little Jimmy Norton how to whistle.  You got a Whistler hat, do you?  I saw that with a little musical note on it.  Oh, you're warmed up there, Steve?  Yeah.  I was whistling out there in the lobby, yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Now, is this the music for it?  I have a question, though.  Yes, Jimmy?  Would all the whistlers laugh if a stroke victim entered?  I'm sorry, what was that?  Oh, let's play...  You're a horrible man.  Let's play Steve's music.  Let's hear the music.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened to the CD?  It didn't skip.  Put it in the...  Oh, Steve, I'm sorry.  You put it in the wrong one, dude. 
[02:16:00]  No, no.  Something happened to CD4.  All right.  Steve the Whistler.  It wasn't working last time.  I'm sorry.  Steve the Whistler.  What?  Oh, what?  God damn it.  What's going on with the CD4?  Dude, you got it.  That's the third time you've had a problem with that one.  Clean it.  This is the same one that was skipping earlier when we...  Put it in the other one.  But take the CD and rub it on your helmet.  I'll try CD2. 
[02:16:30]  Turn it off and turn it on.  And can you turn it off from the back there?  Number four?  Number four?  I'm doing it.  I'm holding the button down.  I'm holding the button.  Track four, right?  Steve, I'm sorry.  Okay.  Here we go.  Steve the Whistler.  I'm holding it down.  It popped.  It popped.  It popped.  It popped.  It popped.  It popped.  It popped.  Steve, you got another copy of the CD? 
[02:17:00]  Make sure you're putting it in the one that I was pressing the button on in the back.  Let's try this.  Oh, God.  Track seven.  A, not B.  This is embarrassing, and this is not the way to run a goddamn radio station.  I'm sorry, Steve. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, I'm embarrassed now.  Do you want to try one more time?  The first track was skipping a little.  Is it our equipment?  Because then I would really be...  Flabbergasted.  ...modified.  Let's try it.  ...modified.  Let's try it again here.  All right.  One more time.  That's not going.  It's stuck.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, nice tone, though, right? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, that was.  I apologize.  All right.  Oh, God.  Well, Steve, I think we're going to have to just take your word for it.  Can I have the CD?  No, no, no.  Look, I'm going to...  I'll check the button in the back.  I don't want to solve that problem.  Where'd everyone go? 
[02:18:30]  Steve, I work with a bunch of lunatics.  I'm sorry.  I don't know where Anthony went.  Jim, why would you look at Steve?  I have no problem looking at Steve.  If it's you, I don't want to look at it.  All right.  Okay, well, if this works, we'll be doing music of the night from Phantom of the Opera.  Say goodbye to your tea cells, everyone.  Oh, Steve the Whistle.  Shh, shh, shh.  All right. 
[02:19:00]  International Grand Champion.  Shh, shh, shh.  Here it comes.  Second.  And...  Whoops.  We got farther that time.  Steve, again, I'm a fan.  I appreciate you coming down.  I'm sorry about the technical glitches.  And that's that, I guess. 
[02:19:30]  Steve the Whistler.  Steve, thank you so much again.  And we'll talk to you soon.  Thanks.  I'm sorry I said those things.  You should be.  Oh, God, I love that one.  I just got uncomfortable again.  I've heard that.  It's got to be a hundred times over the years.  Steve the Whistler.  Yep.  Not funny.  Not funny.  So, we got a surprise Jocktober for everyone. 
[02:20:00]  I love it.  Oh, man.  Do we need the Jocktober intro or anything?  No?  Eh, I mean, if you want to celebrate, but not necessarily.  We got a good beating from a radio show the other day.  A tremendous beating.  Some show called Humble and Fred.  Don't pretend you don't know who they are.  And they basically said they were not funny.  Well, Jim Norton's funny.  You know, that divide and conquer shit. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, but so you got to respect at least.  All right.  Jim Norton is funny, obviously.  And I guess their point was, I don't know.  I guess they were driving around and our show was on, you know, because their PD or something  was listening to it.  The PD obviously is a big fan of ours and was basically hinting, you might want to do  your radio show a little more like this.  Like this.  They're funny.  Uh-huh.  And then Humble and Fred said, they're not funny.  And then the PD said, but they're fun. 
[02:21:00]  The first clip actually is a little refresher from yesterday.  I don't know if I can handle this again.  You got to listen to the beating again, Sam.  You really took it on the chin yesterday.  How dare you?  Oftentimes I'll hear people on these shows and everyone's laughing uproariously.  And I'm thinking, okay, take that sentence, put a premise in a punchline.  It's not getting that loud.  Yeah.  And I think what's happened over time is radio listeners have evolved and they know that  now.  Yeah.  Before it used to be a sense of fun. 
[02:21:30]  Remember that boss we had?  We were talking, we were in New York listening to opening O.P. and Anthony, our boss, and his  famous line.  Fred and I are going, well, these guys aren't funny.  Yeah.  Well, it's not about being funny.  It's about being fun.  Well, no, we're funny.  Yeah.  But they're not funny.  Yeah.  And I'm just going to tell you, they're just, we, it was just not really funny humor.  They got guys in their show that are funny.  Yeah.  Jim Norton, those guys are funny.  Yeah.  Jim Norton's great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  But he says, we're not funny.  Wait, they said, we're funny.  We're funny. 
[02:22:00]  But they're not funny.  Meaning us.  Their type of humor.  Their brand of humor.  And they got a hole on the show, so.  Which is pathetic.  Oh, no.  That makes it funny.  No, it doesn't.  It's so fun.  No?  And they also, it shows you have no fucking balls to tell your PD, look, I don't want  to do radio with a hole.  You don't want some bitch.  Guys don't want to be doing radio with holes.  No.  Now, if it's a woman and she's funny and can hang with the, quote, guys, that's one thing.  But in most cases, it's just a hole that's in the way, as we've pointed out many times 
[02:22:30]  over the years.  And they made the mistake of saying that it's got to be funny on stage, like most things  you take and put them on stage.  And I get that sentiment, but that's not the way it is with radio.  It's like things are not always going to be funny on a comedy stage because they're contextual.  Yeah.  Their whole gauge to whether something's funny or not is to listen to it.  And they go, now, would that be funny if a comic had set it on a stage?  Would the audience be laughing?  And that isn't the context.  How about we acknowledge it's just a stupid concept they're coming up with?  Yeah.  Like if E-Rock walks in, like I said yesterday, if one of you guys says something fat, and 
[02:23:00]  they're like, oh, E-Rock, or whatever the dumb joke is, that's a running inside joke that  wouldn't be funny on stage.  Uh-huh.  So in that regard, they might be right.  But, I mean, you know, we absolutely have been funny on a stage, but it's not our thing  like Jim Norton's.  No, no, no.  I mean, they're wrong.  Like, it's funny in this context in the radio, but it wouldn't work on a comedy stage,  but it works here.  Steve the Whistler on a stage, what we did to that guy, that would be a tremendous  standing ovation. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  So we thought it would only be fair to take a listen to this Humble and Fred radio show  today.  Hope you guys brought your notepads.  So we can learn what funny is.  Right.  Okay, Anthony?  Uh-huh.  I'm waiting.  What?  I said, I hope you guys brought your notepads.  And this is just one show, right?  Yeah, this is just one hour of one show.  This is one hour of one show, because some people like to think that we listen for weeks  just to, you know, find where they fuck up. 
[02:24:00]  No, this is one hour of one show.  One hour of one show.  That's very important here, okay?  So this is a good indication of what they do on the radio.  The good, the bad, the ugly.  Period.  Period.  So today, a little surprise, Jacktober, with Humble and Fred, to see if they are indeed  funny and were not.  We'll see right now.  Maybe you can learn a thing or two.  That's something that you should be getting out of Jacktober, is that maybe you can learn  how to do radio the way you should be doing it.  Shut up.  We'll have an open mind.  We'll see what happens here. 
[02:24:30]  Humble and Fred start with some humor based on returning from vacation.  And it's interesting, I don't know what you find, sort of weird, like, you know, it takes  a few seconds to remember where things are and what buttons to hit and, you know, get  back in the groove.  But I think after 25 years of doing this, it'll all just, the rapartee, the rapport, the snippy  snappy, it's all going to come back.  No, I know what you're saying. 
[02:25:00]  And, you know, we're just...  Snippy snappy.  See, that wouldn't work on a stage.  If you said snippy snappy, it wouldn't?  But that long repertoire, whatever, that would not work on a stage.  If you're going to say that, you have to practice that in your show.  He's just setting it up.  I'm sure it gets funny.  Know where snippy snappy works?  Hopefully on...  On a t-shirt.  Oh, shit.  Rub that one down.  Oh, shit.  Damn it.  Oh, God. 
[02:25:30]  If you release a t-shirt that says snippy snappy,  Oh, please do that.  The opster says, oh, please.  It's just my horrible handwriting.  Good.  Print it.  Perfect.  Back.  No, I know what you're saying.  And, you know, we're just ramping up for the summer season when we're going to be taking  some mega blocks.  What's that going to be like when we come back?  Will we even know how to find our way to the studio?  I don't know.  Given the way our, you know, our minds work at this advanced stage. 
[02:26:00]  I'll just wander around looking for your car.  Looking for the Fredmobile.  What if I can't even find my car?  I'll just wander around looking for the Fredhobo.  With the sticks and the little sack tied to the sticks.  Oof.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know what to say.  With the sticks.  Going down.  Going looking for the Vemma bit.  These guys made fun of us, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you guys are funny. 
[02:26:30]  They are funny.  We're not.  That's what was said.  They're going to look for the Fredmobile.  Otherwise, it'd be a hobo with the sticks and the hanky attached to the sticks.  That would be funny on a stage.  Maybe it's Canadian humor, you know?  Maybe it's Canadian humor.  Maybe that's funny in Canada or something.  I don't know.  Maybe the Canadians could call and tell us.  God, is that terrible?  How's their Facebook page today?  Let's take a look.  I hope the fans aren't being dirty again.  That's rude.  We got a guy from Singapore that wants to say hi. 
[02:27:00]  We got to do this right now, though, Ashman.  We'll talk to you in a little bit.  Humble and Fred are joined by Eileen and intern Tori  and do some inspired comedy material about baby clothes.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  The comedic stylings of Humble and Fred.  Tori over, intern Tori, because she actually began this discussion  because she has offered the great Eileen mama, baby maker, a beautiful onesie. 
[02:27:30]  She's so sweet.  She brought, like, this really fuzzy sleeper, and it's brown and cozy,  and I want to wear it myself.  Shut the fuck up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's so mean.  Oh, fuck her.  What the hell?  Why does that chick have a dick?  Well, here's more importantly, and this is obviously one of their fans.  Why are you asking so harshly?  There's a nicer way to ask that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Now, why does that chick have a dick?  Oh, I see.  I see.  I apologize.  On their Facebook page, there's a chick with a dick receiving penetration in her anus. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  But you can tell it's one of their fans.  Why?  Because the caption says, snippy snappy.  Oh, snippy snappy.  And then it says, homos suck my cock.  I don't know if that's, maybe another one of their catchphrases.  Who's that below?  Uh, that's, uh, Anthony looking like Uncle Sam, but holding a gun.  And it says, we want you to plug your hole.  Ah, plug your hole.  Snippy snappy. 
[02:28:30]  Um, so you don't like the hole there, Ant?  I fucking hate that.  I swear to God, that woman sounds like, we've heard that voice hundreds of times on every  other radio show.  It really is.  It can't be.  You're not doing anything special in radio if you follow the same fucking formula where  you have the hole come in and she's talking about baby clothes and there's not a joke  to be had in her voice.  Yapping about baby clothes.  What happened?  It's not fair.  We may be alone because there's a photo of Tom Skerritt on their Facebook. 
[02:29:00]  Oh.  And the caption says, well, I think the boys are funny.  Oh, see?  Tom Skerritt.  But then there's a picture of the Iron Sheik with either Humble or Fred in the camel clutch.  Right.  Oh, it must be Fred because it says, fuck Fred's ass, make him humble.  Make him humble.  Oh, humble.  Oh, there you go.  Well, let's listen to where this baby clothes thing goes.  Lene, mama, baby maker, a beautiful onesie.  She's so sweet.  She brought like this really fuzzy sleeper and it's brown and cozy and I want to wear it 
[02:29:30]  myself.  Yeah, it's super soft.  I don't want to be rubbing it on my face.  Chicks love to buy chicks baby stuff.  You notice that?  Oh, my God.  It's so cute.  Because you know, there's a caveat with that when they give it over.  It's, I'm so glad it's not me.  No, I don't want to wear the baby.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  No, it's so cute.  It has little bear ears on it and everything.  But when they're little tiny babies, do they grow so quickly?  That thing might wear it once or twice, too.  That's the tragedy. 
[02:30:00]  But it's cute.  Who cares?  No, I know.  It's so cozy.  You might come home in that.  Put it on and blow a guy in a room at the Overlook.  Fucking creep.  Don't be funny, man.  Relax with that funny shit.  They're having just a normal discussion about baby clothes.  But there wasn't a joke in there.  But they said they were joking.  They were joking.  Oh, there you go.  They said in that clip, oh, I was just joking.  Would you do that on stage?  Would you say you're joking?  No. 
[02:30:30]  You wouldn't?  You're the experience.  That's the litmus test, he said, though.  Was that snippy or snappy?  Which one?  That was a little more snippy.  I'm thinking it might be a little more snappy.  Oh.  A little more snappy.  I didn't like the girls talking about baby clothes segment at all.  You didn't?  Oh, God.  I didn't care for that.  But these guys said they're funny.  Well, I mean, their fans are funny.  Why?  Why are they funny?  Well, there's a photo from the movie Valley Girl, except Jim Norton's face is photoshopped  onto one of the girls.  And under it, it says, this is so grody. 
[02:31:00]  This is so grody.  Canada's checking in.  Dennis Falcone makes an appearance.  It says Dentist Falcone.  Oh, it's Dentist Falcone, and he's a dentist.  Peter in Canada.  Yeah, just want to say, we don't find that funny.  They must be from Newfoundland or something, because nobody likes those movies.  No, you find it funny.  Come on.  You're all about the snippy snappy.  I find their fans funny.  I like the description of the photos from Sam. 
[02:31:30]  That's pretty funny.  Why are their fans putting a picture of a fat naked...  That's Terry Clifford.  That's Terry Clifford.  Yikes.  She's one of the faces of October, Jim Norton.  Technically, it's Terry Clifford's face on the body of Fat Bastard from the film Austin  Powers.  And that's on their Facebook page.  I'm a little friend.  Now Wheeze is going to recall me.  Leave Terry Clifford out of this one, please.  More baby humor that could easily be translated to comedy on a stage? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Meaning, like, this is just, like, more jokes about babies that if you did it on the stage...  Oh, it could be on stages throughout the country.  It's that strong.  I feel so.  Damn.  I mean, this is the clip that humiliates you guys right now.  Humble and Fred saying, we're not funny.  They are.  Remember, they said that, not us.  We don't even...  I swear I'd never heard their names before in my life until yesterday, I guess.  Photoshop on their Facebook page of Kim Kardashian making love to Beavis.  Beavis is mounting her. 
[02:32:30]  He's got Ray J's body.  He was wearing that onesie, which is just a tiny thing, not so long ago.  And now what's he up to?  Like, big boy pants and...  Yeah.  He walked in the house the other day.  He was wearing these khakis and a blue jean shirt.  He looked so cute.  But, oh, man, he wasn't in a very good mood.  He's teething.  He's getting some molars in.  Yeah.  So he'll go from happy, wonderful, sweet little baby John one second to just, like, beside himself the next moment. 
[02:33:00]  And you can see him pushing at his cheeks.  And it happens quickly, thank goodness.  But it's horrible for them.  Do you...  Is your daughter giving him...  What is that?  The Orgel...  Holy fuck!  Heroin also works on any...  My parents used to rub a little.  Heroin on my gums.  Yeah.  Excuse me while I kiss this guy.  Why does he want to kiss a guy?  No, this guy.  He said, excuse me while I kiss this guy. 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  I thought he said this guy.  He said guy.  Did he say guy in that clip?  Yes, he did.  He must want to kiss a guy, then.  All right.  He doesn't want to interrupt the show.  What was that?  But they said they're funny.  There's a photo on their Facebook page of a large woman.  Yeah.  And then Terry Clifford.  And then E-Rock.  And they're all fat and they're all nude.  And they're all sitting together.  And it looks to be...  Is that a dildo?  Maybe a dildo party?  It looks like it's a dildo water bottle party. 
[02:34:00]  Let's go to Brooklyn and say hi to Mikey.  Mikey, what's up?  What's up, Opie?  Hey, Mike.  Anthony, what's up?  Yeah, I do.  Hi.  I was listening to this.  I was really wondering what a hole was.  But after listening to that fucking woman go on about baby clothes,  I think that pretty much fucking answered my question.  Yeah, she is the definition of a hole.  But we've heard this exact voice and delivery so many times over the years. 
[02:34:30]  It's a woman that they force on radio shows to have the female perspective.  And what they end up doing is just getting in the way of everything.  I mean, everything.  Look at what they turned that conversation into.  Huh?  That's to attract female listeners?  I think it's an insult to women that PDs assume that a woman like that  is going to bring in females to listen to a particular radio show.  That's representative of the chick. 
[02:35:00]  It's horrible.  And if the guys get too edgy, she will always, the hole will always step in  and go, now, now, and try to calm them down a little bit.  It's the worst thing to happen to radio.  It could be the number one worst thing in radio.  Well, you don't like the lady's point of view.  But I've heard women that do do a good job on the radio.  Do do.  Funny.  I don't know about that.  There's not a lot. 
[02:35:30]  I'll be honest with you.  But there are a few that certainly pull it off.  There's a woman that works with Brother Weese.  She does a very good job.  Weese has always found different type of women to do the radio show with up there.  I would never say that Weese has a hole on his show.  You got Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  She knows how to be a female on the radio without doing this shit that we're listening to today.  And I'm trying to think of others.  Yeah, good luck.  I mean, Jenny Hutt was pretty good at it. 
[02:36:00]  She was.  We beat her up, or I certainly beat her up, but she was good.  Yeah, we beat her up.  And she had to deal with that twat.  That's true.  Martha Stewart's daughter.  She had to deal with that shit.  But she did a good job on the radio as well.  Why is there a man train on their Facebook page?  Well, that's a...  Troy Kwan is the...  Troy Kwan.  And the one who is just getting his asshole penetrated and not penetrating anybody else is E-Rock.  Oh, no. 
[02:36:30]  Who's the gayest one there, you think?  I would think, um...  Probably that E-Rock's just getting penetrated.  I think the one in front is the gayest one, right?  No, one of the guys in the middle, because that means that they can get fucked in the ass  and keep a good enough erection to fuck someone else.  True.  I'd say the guy in the back would be the luckiest duck.  I think the guy in the back is, uh, you know, the lesser of the gays.  The thing is, though, nobody's following your advice.  This is why I think it's their fans, not our fans.  Right.  Because there are still a lot of Terry Clifford photos popping up. 
[02:37:00]  There certainly are.  Are they all making you look like a fat pig?  Yeah, they're all...  It's not about her.  They're photoshopping her head under very, very fat, nude bodies.  And I feel like if it was our fans, they would have listened to you.  And why are they putting her and E-Rock in a lot of...  Well, it's the same theme.  It's like E-Rock's face and her face photoshopped onto big, fat, nude bodies.  Humble and Fred, who said they're funny and we're not, just want to remind the people,  although they do think Jim Norton's funny.  Thank you.  Um, they have finally moved on from the horrendous baby talk that went absolutely nowhere. 
[02:37:30]  That's a little unfair.  Why?  Because they did, I mean, maybe you haven't noticed, but it is a thing where it's like  you get a baby a onesie and it's like two weeks later, they don't even fit this thing anymore.  You gotta be very careful how you talk about your kids on the radio.  You don't think they pulled it off?  No.  Oh.  You gotta be extremely careful.  I would never bring any of that shit they just talked about to our show.  Never.  But they move on. 
[02:38:00]  And now they do a Kinnison-esque bit.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Humble and Fred.  Now the funny.  It's about cooking turkey.  Yeah, and it just reminded me, because they talk about doing stuff on stage and I was like,  this is amongst the greats, Kinnison and...  Right, you know, they say, they're saying that what they do on their radio show is funny  and it also translates to a stage, which is the stupidest concept I've ever heard, but  let's see how funny they are in this clip.  I can't remember anything else. 
[02:38:30]  Don't they tell you to take it out like half an hour before it's...  I've said that to you so many times.  What?  To you.  It's all about when you take it out.  Exactly.  Like my meat thermometer says 190, would that be Fahrenheit or Celsius?  It's 160 something for turkey, I believe.  Mm-hmm.  No, no.  Well, is it?  Celsius.  Whatever it is, whatever your meat thermometer says, take it about 10 degrees sooner and  just put it on the counter because it continues to, you know, covered on the counter.  It continues to cook.  Oh, no, no, I hear you. 
[02:39:00]  So take it out early and that's the key.  People keep it in the oven right up to temperature.  Wrong.  And then take it out and that's when it dries out.  Figure it out.  I need somebody who would take it out, cut it up, and then put it back in the oven to  keep it warm.  Oh, jeez.  It's like, why don't you just kill us?  Just kill, you know, why don't you just.  Just give me sandpaper.  Get a load of this.  When we do our little fall thing sometimes, there's a person when it's their turn to do  the turkey, they'll cook it the day before.  No.  And then slice it and then just serve it.  And it's just like, you know what?  You might as well just take it and throw it in the garbage. 
[02:39:30]  I'm to the point that now I think they're just delusional.  This guy's not good.  This is good humor.  Now, look, let me tell you something.  I understand not everything is going to be hilariously funny, but it should at least be  interesting.  Right, right.  You should at least be able to listen and go, oh, you know what?  That's kind of a compelling little story or argument or discussion, whatever.  That was useless.  They might as well have read from a cookbook. 
[02:40:00]  Yes.  Because I think that's what they were doing.  You didn't like it?  Horrible.  We don't have to say much about this.  They're horrendous.  Let's say hi to Paul in Canada.  Paul.  Hey.  Paul, hey.  No.  What is that?  What is that beep thing?  I don't know.  Aaron in Canada.  What's up, Aaron?  Not much.  Those guys used to be funny like maybe 10 years ago.  Now they're extremely bad.  But how long have they been on the radio? 
[02:40:30]  They've been on up here, honestly, for like, yeah, like a long time.  I was a young lad.  So why is it, and I swear to you, that I've never heard of them until yesterday?  Well, because they used to split up and then one would go one way and go to a different  town like Kingston or whatever, Montreal.  Where are they now?  Something like that.  Where are they now?  They're just podcasting now, I hear.  Yeah.  They used to be in Toronto.  They got kicked off the air because they were a little bit risque for Canada, you know, 
[02:41:00]  us.  What did they do that got them kicked off the air?  Too much turkey talk?  Well, there's more turkey talk, by the way, Ed.  Good news for you.  Good thing.  I love that turkey talk.  All right.  Well, really?  Thank you, Aaron.  Oh, yeah.  It's fantastic.  Not a problem.  Thank you, guys.  Here's, they keep the comedy turkey themed going.  But move the focus to the turkey wings.  Ah, okay.  Turkey wings are good, too.  Yeah.  That's hard.  The tips, you know, you can't. 
[02:41:30]  They're tough.  But the meat on the long wing is just delicious.  Do you think there's a business model for you and I to open up the first hot turkey wing  pub type of thing?  It's funny you say that.  Please.  I went to a restaurant on the weekend with, I have a cousin who's from out of town.  Yeah, where is she?  Oh, no, she's going to come in a little bit.  I haven't seen her literally since I was seven years old.  So it's been, you know.  20 years.  Sure, thank you.  But her daughter goes to Humber down the street and everything. 
[02:42:00]  So I got acquainted with her, blah, blah, blah.  Long story short, we went to this restaurant.  Tapas, you absolutely love it.  One of the things is two turkey wings.  You're kidding me.  I swear to God.  Yeah, you couldn't do that, though.  No, I know.  It would be way too expensive.  I was just mostly doing a bit.  This could be the most mundane show we've ever listened to as far as the whole Jocktober bit.  As far as Jocktober.  This is so mundane.  But my favorite part was the very last thing in that clip.  What?  You're kidding me?  Like, oh, my God, that's amazing. 
[02:42:30]  The silence?  No.  He goes, I was mainly doing a bit.  What bit?  I was mainly doing a bit.  What you just heard just now.  That was a bit?  It was a bit.  Well, by me, I missed it.  A bit of what?  Let's say hi to a bit of diarrhea, I would say.  This is Stephanie in Fort Brad.  Stephanie.  Yeah, I think that all the women that listen to you guys completely agree with you, because  the woman that you're listening to right now sounds like a dry fucking cut. 
[02:43:00]  I mean, seriously, she sounds like she needs to go pick some fucking flowers for somebody.  I think it's an insult to women, you know, that listen to radio, that these PDs think  that that's going to represent them on radio shows.  It's embarrassing.  Absolutely.  I think that many women aren't like that, you know what I mean?  In real life, seriously, are we really going to be like, oh, I'm going to try in some  little baby's fucking jacket, because it's so soft.  Right. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  I don't fucking think so.  All right.  Well, thank you, Stephanie.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Joe in Oklahoma.  Joe.  Hey, you guys, on the heels of one of the greatest unmasked of all time, these clowns  say that what isolate things that you say are not funny on stage.  Right.  That's fucking ridiculous.  You guys could do a show in a different city every fucking day. 
[02:44:00]  Well, I mean, it's not our...  We're on a stage.  We're on a stage, for God's sake.  Yeah, it's not our strength, but we certainly pull it off, and we could, you know, throw  a few lines out there and get people laughing.  Yeah, I mean, we were on a stage at Caroline's Run Mass, and we certainly got a lot of laughs  in, so...  I think they're just...  They're on the radio now, I think.  Who, Humble and Fred?  Yes, C-I-K-R-F-M.  Well, they're on SiriusXM, Canada.  Well, good for them.  They're horrendous.  They're on SiriusXM.  Thanks, Joe. 
[02:44:30]  They're in Toronto and in Peterborough.  We got two more.  You want to try to get through this?  Please.  All right, so it's Humble and Fred who said, they're funny, we're not.  Correct.  Except for Jim Norton.  And our stuff doesn't translate to a stage or something like that.  I don't even understand that.  These are your fans, Jim.  And they got a horrendous hole that is just adding absolutely nothing on top of their nothing.  You mean Eileen?  That's her name?  That's her name.  All right.  Guys do a little improv comedy riffing with their intern, Tori. 
[02:45:00]  That's something you guys have done.  Are you from a broken home like so many of the youth?  Yeah, I am.  Are you really?  I just took a guess.  Of course.  Well, my parents got divorced when I was like six months old.  Really?  So it's not too easy to talk about it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not at all.  Do you need a moment?  How does that...  That's weird, though.  Did they ever talk to you about that?  What happens like at six months?  Like, you'd think just the responsibility of a child might keep them together until you're  maybe a year.  Well...  I don't know. 
[02:45:30]  My dad was working a lot, apparently.  What was he?  Oh.  Yeah.  Can't relate to that.  Did they explain it this way?  We can't.  Yeah.  We can't relate.  Wait a second.  When you say working a lot, you mean like past 11 in the morning?  Anyway.  Like a job when you get up in the morning and you don't want to go to it?  Right.  One of those?  Like where you have to be somewhere all day.  Hands on.  Tori.  Yeah.  One of those.  Jesus Christ.  It's funny, though.  I don't know.  Isn't she pretty?  They have no business.  Eileen?  Tori. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know.  They have no business taking shots at us.  We don't even know who the fuck they are.  I don't care they took shots, to be honest with you.  But it just makes you, you know, it gives us an excuse to listen to them.  To listen to.  And make fun of them, because obviously they're horrendous.  Let's go to Chris in Toronto.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  This is the reason why I bought SiriusXM.  These guys were on 102.1 in Toronto.  For the worst show ever.  Got sent to AM radio.  And now I'm at radio.com or something.  Okay. 
[02:46:30]  And why did they get kicked off the radio in Toronto?  The ratings were terrible.  They wanted to move to a bunch of guys that were a lot younger.  Right.  I don't know what their fans are doing.  Right.  Like, I don't know if this is one of their bits.  But there's a photo of a man who has pronged his penis.  Why would you prong your penis?  It says snippy snappy.  I don't know if that's what they were referring to.  That's what snippy snappy means.  It could be.  I was reading their Wikipedia.  And there was one.  They broke up a couple times, like in early 90s. 
[02:47:00]  They've been around since 89.  Right.  And then recently, a few years ago, they were on some light FM or whatever station.  And one of the guys got yanked by the station because the ratings weren't good.  So they just changed the name to the Humble Fred Show.  But I guess that didn't happen.  Oh.  All right.  Let's say hi to Patrick in Jersey.  Patrick.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Hey.  You're a little full of shit, man, because you talk about your fucking kids all the time.  Hey, you stupid fuck.  You didn't even get my point. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, shit.  First of all, I don't talk about my kids all the time because I don't want to put them in the public spotlight.  And I carefully pick some of the shit that goes on at home that might be entertaining or funny to these guys.  I don't come in here with just mundane fucking baby talk.  And that was my point.  You stupid fuck.  I never heard any jumper stories.  Never heard any jumper stories.  I purposely don't come in here with stories about my kids.  Every once in a while, I'll come up with something that might be entertaining. 
[02:48:00]  Seriously, though, how quick do they outgrow their shoes?  Exactly.  Did I ever come in with shit like that?  He awakes.  So fast.  I'm so sick of fucking people that don't even listen or get the point you're trying to make.  Yeah.  I didn't say I didn't bring, you know, that I didn't talk about my kids on the show.  But I'm very careful about that because I know how boring that could be if you bring the wrong shit to the show.  That's why you've got to talk about, you know, what kind of little jumper. 
[02:48:30]  Right, exactly.  In Stranger News, there is a photo of the mom from 90 Day Fiance.  Right.  And it's on their Facebook page, Humble and Fred, and under it, it says, Time for a Man Sandwich.  I love the fact that she enjoys a good man sandwich.  Manwich.  All right, finally, one more clip from Humble and Fred.  The divorce comedy continues.  What's the divorce comedy? 
[02:49:00]  Well, they were talking about the intern being a child of divorce.  Oh, right, right, right.  In a comedic fashion.  I already forgot.  I swear I forgot what the last clip was.  So, what, the intern's from a broken family, I guess?  Well, yeah, the intern said that her parents got divorced when she was six months old.  So, that's just, I mean, there's just tons of comedy there that they've been going through.  Right, okay.  Did they explain to you they broke up because you ruined their marriage?  I did not.  I was asking.  Well, see, that's funny because that's what I was getting at, and then you say it. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, well, I was going to say something flippant like, oh, geez, they couldn't handle you that much.  Well, no, but you make, I mean, I'm, again, doing a comedy bit, but really you think, okay,  you're together, you have this beautiful child, and then six months into it, you go, nah, this  isn't working for us anymore.  Well, they had my sister.  She's two years older than me.  Oh, I see.  And then they had me two years later.  Yeah, so it's not worth it.  All right, Humble and Fred, you know, good luck to you. 
[02:50:00]  I like flippant.  The word flippant is never good.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Maybe we're just missing the comedy.  I don't know.  That was a good little example, too.  It wasn't just one thing that we sat and listened to and went, oh, that's terrible.  Right.  You know, because anybody could do that.  That was a lot.  A lot of who gives a fuck talk by these guys.  What's that?  There's a photo on Humble and Fred's Facebook page.  Uh-huh.  And the photo is here in our studio.  Right. 
[02:50:30]  But it's in our hallway.  And it's Club Son of Kenny and William Shatner.  And they're sitting next to each other.  But William Shatner is ignoring Kenny.  Right.  But the key to the photo is, while he's ignoring Kenny, Terry Clifford is performing the fellatio on  Mr. Shatner.  That didn't happen.  That's what it did in the photo.  Did that happen?  That did not happen, Sam.  I missed that.  Paul.  Taking the photo is the only thing.  Paul in Canada.  Paul.  Huh?  Yo, Paul.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing, fellas?  You already fucked us once. 
[02:51:00]  Let's do this.  You're the guy that called earlier.  You called back.  It's a fantastic sailor service that we have in Canada.  Uh-huh.  Not to mention Humble and Fred.  They stink.  They always did stink, and they're no good.  I don't know how they can trash talk you guys when they got nothing to offer.  They used to try some outrageous stunts like you guys, and they were just garbage.  Like, not even close.  Ouch.  They're absolutely horrible.  Well, I mean, we gave them a fair shot today, and I didn't find anything amusing whatsoever  in there.  Or interesting, like Ann pointed out.  If you're not going to be funny, you've got to at least try to get some interest going 
[02:51:30]  with your radio show.  Somebody commented on one of their posts, you guys are a chipper off the old block.  Oh, nice.  That's funny right there.  At least it's clever.  A little wordplay humor.  That's right.  Humor.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy has a comment.  Nova Scotia checking in.  Mr. Leahy.  Who wanted for Scotia?  Mr. Leahy.  I'm going to tip it.  Hey, boy.  Stop it.  Hey.  Hey, boy.  Hey.  What's happening?  What's up? 
[02:52:00]  These guys got to break hitting me.  They're just not Gouda.  Oh, the cheese jokes.  We can't do the cheese jokes today.  Oh, God.  I feel like, you know, they have some really good stuff.  Right.  They maybe have just toned down the jokes a little bit and were a little more serious.  They might have been able to.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe you could go see Jim Norton at Caroline's this weekend.  Oh.  Nice save.  I know.  Exactly. 
[02:52:30]  Nice save.  All right.  There you go.  There's Humble and Fret.  Humble and Fret.  Yeah.  And, I mean, we must have caught him on a bad day because they have one of the wildest  Facebook pages I've ever seen on a radio show.  At least they're trying to get a good Facebook page going.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a photo of Roland.  It appears to be nude and eating grapes.  Picture of Michael Jackson with E.T.  And it says Alien vs. Predator.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, there's a photo of you, Opie. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And it's the photo of you sticking your finger out with your mouth open.  Right.  It says Greg Opie Hughes wants you to go viral.  And by that, he means get AIDS.  Wow.  That's not nice.  Wow.  Not nice.  Oh, wow.  Who's that girl?  Well, it's a girl.  She's wearing a shirt.  If you look closely, Chip Chipperson is on her shirt.  And it says Chippy Kaye, mother fucker.  I'm filling.  Let's say hi to Dan in Canada.  One more call on this crap.  Go ahead. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, boys.  How you doing today?  Pretty good, Dan.  Oh, Dan.  Listen, man.  I don't get to listen to you guys enough.  I'm in the military, and I'm away a lot.  So when I do get to catch you, I enjoy the show a lot.  And I've listened to this humble and Fred.  And for the love of Christ, the only reason I want to know what channel they're on,  on SiriusXM is so I can block it.  These two jackasses are not funny.  They're garbage.  And I think the only reason they're chewing on you guys is so that's their only hook. 
[02:54:00]  So you start mentioning them, and they're that desperate for listening.  Well, that's the risk you take mentioning other radio shows.  But I think it's safe to say that most of us will forget completely about these guys by noon today.  So I'm not too worried about it.  Hummel and Fred are not afraid to mention another radio show.  If you go to their Facebook page, there's actually a photo of Mike Francesa about to spill his Diet Coke.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Yeah, these guys are a couple of real...  They're total...  They've been about four or five radio stations in Canada. 
[02:54:30]  They're junk.  They got moved on.  I know there was a guy in Canada who I thought was a really good guy.  I don't know if you guys have heard of him.  Dean Blondell.  No.  I know Dean.  Oh, do you?  No.  I'll check him out, I guess.  Yeah, check him out.  He got thrown off of 102.1.  He was really, really controversial.  He'd been warned by...  I don't care.  I don't care.  I took some more. 
[02:55:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Hey, listen.  Yeah, go ahead.  Still enjoy the show, man.  This is the only thing...  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  Sorry, something's bleeding through.  What were you saying?  I said this is the only...  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[02:55:30]  Nothing better than that one.  What's the name of that?  But if I could bring this...  I don't know, Chip.  If I could bring this instant replay on a stage, that would be funny, right?  That'd be great.  You'd just sit there and play them.  Yep, yep.  Their post about today's show, one of the comments is, snippy snappy, double guns, bitch.  Double guns.  That's a good one, bitch.  Yeah, cool, right?  Fucking assholes.  I want to know what this Tori looks like.  From the broken home.  Ah. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Well, we can figure that out during the break.  Smelling a little limp over by the water hole.  Smelling a little cracked hoof over there.  The old watering hole.  Can they smell a cracked hoof?  Oh, can they ever.  Really?  They just smell fucking injury.  I don't know how.  A cracked hoof probably gives off an odor, right?  Maybe.  Like rot or...  Yeah.  I think it's just like an injury.  Gives off some kind of vibe and they're like...  Yeah.  Like I'm creeping over.  Fucking rip its throat out. 
[02:56:30]  Love it.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got Russell Simmons coming in in about a half hour.  He's not going to sit here and talk about meditation, is he?  I think that's what his book's about.  I do like to meditate, believe it or not.  Believe it or not, especially if you've heard me going after that caller, but I like meditating.  But I can't imagine actually having a long conversation about it.  I goofed on a little bit on our show, but he's not going to talk about meditation the whole time, is he?  What if we can get you guys centered?  We're centered.  What?  Relax on that. 
[02:57:00]  Huh?  We're very centered here.  You're a bit left of center.  Oh, boy.  What are you, Hannity?  Ah.  Ooh.  You want to talk about meditation today, Ed?  Uh, no.  I'm curious.  There are certain things about meditation that I'm...  Why do you say it that way?  I'm just curious, that's all.  About what?  Meditation.  I want to know about it.  I've never been able to do it. 
[02:57:30]  You want to know about what?  I'm tense, and I'm always high-strung,  and some people just enjoy meditation.  I'm not very good at doing it.  No?  No.  Well, you could ask Russell about it.  Could you teach me how to meditate?  Meditation.  We'll probably talk about something else before Russell,  so stay where you are.

[03:10:30]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley  Leave your penis alone. The Opie and Anthony Show is back on. 
[03:11:00]  All right, we got a guy in Singapore. He just waded through that Humble and Fred crap.  I'll take the thing.  Let's, uh...  Yeah, we're the thing of rich, right? Hey, go ahead, get him.  Let's give him a minute or two, and then we got Russell Simmons. He showed up early.  Um, Ashman, what's up?  Because I'm the Ashman. 
[03:11:30]  I'm so sorry about doing that. I was just buying food, and I was waiting for you all. So, yeah, I'm a huge fan. I love you all. Jimmy, I love you so much. You guys are amazing.  How are you listening to us in Singapore? I get so confused by this.  Uh, I'm a huge fan of, uh, uh, Patrice O'Neal, and, um, I was just reading about him and looking through...  You have bad news for him.  You might want to sit down.  You might want to sit down if you're behind on the show.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, that's the problem, you know, because I'm behind. I know what happened to Patrice. I've listened, uh, you know, I've listened to the show, and I try and catch up as much as possible.  So, but the only way possible for me is through YouTube, you know? Um, so, yeah.  I mean, uh, you know, we're all, you know, extremely bummed to this point that, uh, you know, Patrice is no longer with us, but I got to tell you, he, he turned a lot of fucking people onto this radio show.  Yeah, he was amazing.  He was amazing. 
[03:12:30]  I found him through, uh, uh, appearance on Jimmy Fallon, and I thought he was hilarious, and I started watching his, uh, comedy bits, and then, uh, I thought he was hilarious, and I started watching his, uh, comedy bits, and then, uh,  I was already a fan of people like Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, and then, uh, I used to see Jim Norton on, uh, Jay Leno, but I didn't know who he was, really, and I didn't know he was a comic and stuff, and then through the show, I found out he was a comic, and Jimmy, I love your, I love your, I love your special, and I love your stuff, and you guys are amazing.  Thank you. This was a good call to take.  I know, I just love it. We're basking in your compliments. Thank you very much. 
[03:13:00]  And it's Singapore, so we feel like we should give him a few minutes here.  I know, right?  Believe me, if you were from, if you were from, uh, from South Brunswick, you would have got the I don't care plate.  The old wax.  I really enjoy it. I don't care.  That's the exact same phone call from the other guy.  It really is, because you said Bill Burr, we all kind of like you.  Bill Burr, and you're calling from Singapore, we feel like we gotta leave you alone.  You ever had a good caning?  They love doing that in Singapore, too.  It's what you call the corporal punishment in schools. 
[03:13:30]  They bail you out that I've been, I've been keen a lot of times for smoking in school, for currency and stuff like that.  You know, caning is just a normal thing.  If you don't get keen, you're a faggot.  That's basically it.  All right, listen, we got Russell Simmons.  He's coming into the studio.  Thank you very much.  Call's back, Ashman. I appreciate it, all right?  All right, all right. Take care, guys.  Bye.  Goodbye. Thank you for the call.  Russell Simmons back in studio.  My God.  Bye, big famous. 
[03:14:00]  How are you doing?  Doing good, man.  I can't believe you guys let me back on.  Really?  Oh, why not?  You're a nice man.  That's what I call.  My team said that, you know, no, that you can't go on their show now.  They're not having a lot of guests.  Well, we go through stages.  We've gotten picky with the guests.  We kind of go through stages, and we need to, like, just take a break in general, because  we feel like we can't get our own stuff in, because we have to interview.  Our very important commentary on the day.  All of a sudden, we can't do our dick jokes. 
[03:14:30]  You can't do dick jokes with me.  People clamor for them, and what are we going to do?  Right.  Deny the people what they want?  I don't dare anybody.  Not to put you on the spot, but we got a very interesting call.  Nothing too bad, by the way, from a guy who said he wants us to ask you about Occupy  Wall Street.  He didn't understand why you were supporting Occupy Wall Street, because you kind of have  your own credit.  Did he say credit card?  Yeah, he was talking about the credit card.  Oh, you have the debit card.  Yeah, you get your money two days early.  And you're sort of in.  I've built a whole industry.  And they all followed me. 
[03:15:00]  Like, American Express borrowed my idea.  Right.  Really?  Chase Manhattan borrowed my idea.  Walmart borrowed my idea.  Wait, what's the idea now?  The idea was to build a virtual bank for people, underserved communities.  Right.  In other words, people who had no bank account could now have a debit card where their money  was deposited directly in their account, and they could then interact with the world.  Other than that, you fucked.  Right.  But you don't do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With no card, no plastic.  But you didn't do that through a bank at first?  A bank, yeah.  I don't have, I don't, I didn't occupy for any other reason. 
[03:15:30]  I occupy because our government is flawed, because money rules our government, not people.  Right.  And I occupied for the most, everything we complain about is because some politician was paid.  Right.  Whether it's the prison industrial complex, or the tax system, or whatever it is that we  don't like, it's because lobbyists have overrun our government.  Right.  And what we want is, and I even wrote a constitutional amendment, which we, and everybody at the  progressive caucus, all the Democrats, oh yeah, yeah, they're a motherfucker.  They definitely do not want to get money out of politics. 
[03:16:00]  No.  They definitely, because that's how they stay in office.  Of course.  So you didn't care about people, like the 1% of rich citizens, it was more the government.  Why the fuck, because if you're rich, you can't help the poor?  That's stupid.  I mean, that's unreasonable.  If you're rich, you can help the poor.  You can occupy.  You can't want to make the government more fair.  You can't want to make this country more of a place for everybody.  It's seen as hypocritical, yeah, yeah.  They say, oh, you got money, why the fuck are you occupying?  I got money, I run five charities.  Well, that's why it's a good question, because that guy was a little confused by the whole 
[03:16:30]  thing.  Yeah, well, if you know, you can't, well, Reverend Ike would say, that's not true, though.  The poor can't help the poor, but that's not true at all.  Of course, you can help yourself and others, and your prayer is greater than your work.  But if you have resources, you should use them to benefit others.  How, at what point, like, everyone has a cutoff point.  I heard Reggie Jackson, when he got a lot of money, would let people come to him once.  Like, people who he knew.  Oh, yeah, you got to pay him off, man.  So make it good.  Show up.  Like, they just show up, and they're your friends. 
[03:17:00]  But I like to help kids.  Adults, I can help once, and that way I help you once.  And you don't pay me back, and I don't have to fuck with you.  It's like, I helped you.  Yeah, exactly.  Now I'm going to, yeah.  Right, right.  But if there are relatives, and if they want their cable turned back on or something.  Yeah, yeah.  But you don't, that's not your job.  Wait, to be paid back, that's very interesting.  Because a lot of people think that, you know, they come to you for a favor for some money,  and you help them out.  They just assume, oh, you have so much money, I don't have to pay you back.  Well, you don't have to.  Then you don't have to call me. 
[03:17:30]  But the problem is, in my life, is that they don't even have the discussion.  You know what I mean?  They just assume.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I don't have the discussion later, because I don't pick up.  But I would be a good guy in the end, but they just assume, like, hey, man, I need to pay my oil bill.  You give it to them, but then there's never a conversation about paying back.  I honestly, I think out of every dollar I've given out, I've probably been paid back two cents.  That's what I'm getting at.  About two cents.  But that's, in a way, that's okay. 
[03:18:00]  But what bothers me, I'll say it again, is that there's not even discussion.  They don't ask.  It's just assumed, like, oh, yeah, I got money from you, and you don't need it back.  I get that.  You get it, right?  It is assumed.  And they could just borrow it and pay you back without interest.  Because you're not going to charge interest like a bank, and I wouldn't charge my...  So it's like, if they pay you back, you're still getting a loan with no interest.  We're not a bank, Jerry.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, people are.  But I figure a guy with your kind of money, people come around, and it's got to be a cutoff point.  They say I'm richer than I am.  I mean, every time I'm with a girl that's a hot girly, like, this thing is worth this much, and it's not really true. 
[03:18:30]  They just try to, you know, they try to figure it out, you know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  So that's what it is.  You got a lot of money, sir.  I ain't got that.  You got a lot of money.  I'll try, Jay-Z.  I ain't got that type of paper.  That's all.  That's vodka.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  Puff is getting more money than God.  I mean, he's getting paper.  And Jay-Z, if he opens his mouth, you know, you're going to give him a million dollars.  Yep.  But when those are your comparisons, like, look, I don't have as much as Puffer Jay-Z.  I shouldn't even say that.  You're doing really well.  That's not fair.  But I mean, I always read that.  That's my comparison.  Right.  But anyway, oh, my God. 
[03:19:00]  Wait, wait.  Before we get to the book, is that hat, is it what I'm thinking it is?  It's not what it is.  It looks like me, but no, it's Narrative.  It's my advertising agency.  Oh, okay.  It's an advanced digital solution company.  I have a company called All Deaf Digital.  All right.  And we do all kind of fun shit.  If you go to All Deaf Digital, you'll see comedy, poetry, and crazy comedy, and ridiculously  fun poetry, and a lot of music.  Right.  So ADD is the name of the company.  And this N, Narrative, is a creative arm.  It does digital solutions, like creative campaigns for lots of companies. 
[03:19:30]  Okay, right, right.  It integrates nicely.  It's very clever, because it says N, and then the dash could be for word.  You've been involved in comedy for a long time with Deaf Jam, and you got into a bit of  a snag with the Harriet Tubman sex tape.  Oh, don't bring that shit.  No, but the reason I'm asking you is because you've always had, you've had a great history  with comedy, and it seems like sometimes you try to do something, and it just gets misconstrued.  I, everything, my poetry, I got a Tony, but when I put it up, I had a lot of people picketing. 
[03:20:00]  They didn't like the anti-war poets, they didn't like the Palestinian girl, they didn't  like the Jewish boy who had, I mean, they didn't like anybody.  And they were upset about the poetry.  And then Deaf Comedy Jam, when we started the NAACP, and everybody went insane.  They forgot, you know, now they all, they honor Martin, Jamie, Cedric, Bernie Mac, Chris  Tucker, they honored, you know, Dave Chappelle, they honored Steve Harvey, they honored, you  know, all these guys became famous, they liked them better.  But when they told those first jokes, they didn't like them very much. 
[03:20:30]  Right, right.  And Public Enemy, who's now in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they shot my office that  we were hiding under the desk, the JDL shot up our office, the head of the JDL, he went  to jail.  Wow, wow.  A sniper.  Because they didn't like what Public Enemy was saying.  So, you know, it, it, over a period of time, they soften up.  Yeah, I guess so, yeah.  So you've had the controversy, and you've dealt with it.  What, what happened with this, and what, where do they misunderstand, like, what was your  intention that they just took wrong, and then you're like, oh, shit.  It happens all the time.  I don't want to discuss that shit in a moment.  But I am now producing a piece, and I've read a hundred scripts on Harriet Tubman. 
[03:21:00]  But I, I contacted the family, you know, they were really, you know, they were really  cool.  And I, and I thought I was going to do Frederick Douglass, and then there were some complications  with that.  I have a deal at HBO, like five different shows in development.  One of the shows, which I'm looking for, a writer for, and I've read all the scripts  out there, pretty much, is Harriet Tubman.  I think it's a great kind of docu-series.  I'm always surprised.  It's like whenever you do any kind of docu-series, I mean, you know, um, right.  Mini-series.  Right, right.  My instinct when somebody misunderstands anything I do is to get angry. 
[03:21:30]  I, I tend to get very angry and get very defensive and, and attack, but you kind of came out  nicely and said, all right, and you just...  I apologize immediately.  I never apologize for shit.  But that one, I said, you know what, people are really mad, and I don't want them, you know.  Do you personally think that, like, nothing is untouchable as far as the arts go, comedy, poetry?  I, I feel that way.  Personally, right.  Most personally, I feel like whatever they want to say is fine.  Yeah, that's how it should be.  You express what's in the heart, and the problem is, poets, like rappers, and, you know, poets  or any other kind of artists, they say things that are in the heart, and most people guard 
[03:22:00]  the heart so much, they don't even know what's in it.  They don't know how sexist, racist, homophobic, you know, gangster we are.  They don't know that.  Like, rappers are less homophobic than their parents, right?  They're less racist than their parents.  They're less sexist than their parents.  You know, they're less gangsta than our government.  I mean, they're not so bad as you think, but they're saying what's on our hearts, and we  can't believe how sexist they are.  Right, right, right.  In the back of our mind, we're thinking, ass and titties.  Is that the song, right?  That's the song, right? 
[03:22:30]  But they say it.  You can't believe these fuckers say that.  Right, right, right.  But that's what we're thinking.  That's what our job is to express what we're thinking.  Yeah, and for some reason, it's when an actor portrays someone in a role, that's fine  if they play somebody who's racist or sexist or homophobic.  But if you're doing it in comedy or in poetry, it seems to be connected to who you really  are a lot more.  Well, it is.  Mostly it is.  And if it's...  I mean, as a comedian, I don't think I would be saying a whole bunch of homophobic stuff 
[03:23:00]  because I'm not a homophobe.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I've been a gay rights activist.  I wouldn't be saying a lot of...  I wouldn't be making fun of a lot of stuff.  Do you think there's any funny gay jokes out there?  Lots of funny gay jokes.  Yeah.  Of course.  Okay.  There's funny black jokes, funny white jokes.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a weird thing, too, when you're writing...  When you're doing material and trying to make...  Because as a poet, you talk about something and that's kind of...  You're incorporating it into your art or when you're an actor.  So as a comic, the only way to incorporate something into your art is to be funny about  it, whether it's making fun of it or making fun of the reaction to it. 
[03:23:30]  Right.  So as a comic, when they tell you, don't do this, they're really taking away your ability  as an artist to discuss something that an actor or a poet can talk about.  Yeah.  I'm not offended by any artist's expression.  I don't have to agree with everything these people say.  I'm not offended by Bill O'Reilly.  I'm not offended by Sean Hannity.  Right, right.  You know, Roger Ailes is my friend.  I mean, they're all fine by me.  I don't have the same political beliefs as them, but it doesn't make me angry.  I wish it was easier to have honest discussions in this day and age.  That's what I do with the Imams and Rabbis in 40 countries, and we have hundreds and hundreds 
[03:24:00]  of programs, and they come out loving each other.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, when they actually just talk.  And I talk to people who have different political or social beliefs or whatever the fuck, and  I just, I'm fine.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I don't feel damaged, you know, because they're different.  No.  If you talk to somebody who just shares your viewpoints on everything, it's going to be  a short, dull conversation.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  You run in some amazing circles.  Like, you have groups of friends in very, very different areas.  I think that's one of the most beautiful things about them, is that you can be in different 
[03:24:30]  places.  That's really good.  I got to take it.  You helped a guy, and he wants to talk badly.  Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Yeah, yeah.  Russell's putting his headphones on.  Hold on, Paul.  Hold on, Paul.  All right, now go.  What's going on?  How are you doing, Russell?  I just wanted to talk to you.  Actually, you helped out a friend of mine years ago.  His name is Kareem Ramos.  I know you know Kareem pretty well.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he worked for me, and now he's become this fitness expert. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he's actually, he's been a big inspiration on my life, too, and he always talks to me  about how much you helped him out, and all you did for him, and really showed me a side  of you that I had never known, you know, through the media so long.  He sent me a text yesterday morning about my book, yesterday morning, and it was really  nice what he wrote, so I, you know, I get the shout out.  What do you mean you helped him out?  He was down on his luck, or?  How did I help him?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he explained, because actually he has a book from Fat Farm to Fat Farm, where he  was a really heavy kid, and his brother had wound up, you know, passing on, and he got 
[03:25:30]  in shape and was doing really well, but was still struggling a little bit on the work circuit,  and somehow, I'm not exactly sure, came into contact with Russell, and, you know, Russell  and him really hit it off, and, you know, obviously now he's working for Russell, but I know that  you helped him out a lot with publishing his book, and he really is an inspirational type  person, a very positive person, and, you know, he credits a lot of that to Russell.  Look at that, paying it forward.  You helped him out, and now this guy's helping Paul out in Jersey. 
[03:26:00]  All right, that's good news.  All right, Paul.  All right.  Thank you.  It leads to the book, Success Through Stillness, Meditation Made Simple by Russell Simmons.  They told me don't write this fucker.  They said, please don't write it.  Really?  Yeah, because the super rich really is a state of needing nothing.  Right.  It was a big bestseller, and it was a way to talk about the Yoga Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita  and lots of scripture, but I simplified it and made it easy to digest, but the title, you  know, it made sense.  It was easy, and do you, Oprah sold those two books, sold the hell out of them, and then 
[03:26:30]  the publisher says, you're going to write a book on meditation?  All right, we'll pass.  Oh, sure, yeah.  And I said, well, I'll take a fifth of the money.  Give me a big back end.  And now this book is bigger than other two books.  Wow.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Good for you.  People need quiet time, you know, kids in schools.  I wrote this book, and my daughter told me it was remedial at best.  She's 11.  But that's okay.  I did open it a couple days ago, and she told me it was the best book on meditation she's 
[03:27:00]  read.  Really?  It's a very simple book, and it's such a simple craft, you know, to study.  What are people's biggest misconceptions about meditation?  Anybody can meditate.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit of patience.  Yeah.  You've got a mantra, you sit your ass still.  My 11-year-old's been meditating three years.  For 20 minutes every morning, I meditate with my two daughters, 14 and 11.  I take them to school.  Every kid in every school should have quiet time.  The doctors, the neuroscientists talk about it in ways. 
[03:27:30]  The left side of the brain and the right side of the brain separate when you're eight.  They start separating.  They start connecting when you meditate.  You can see on a scanner the gray matter on the brain growing when you start to meditate.  You have a more expansive mindset with greater brain functionality.  Your immune system gets pumped up.  If you have ADD, forget the Ritalin.  You can just have quiet time instead.  Now, you were obviously involved in so many things.  How do you clear your mind long enough to just sit for it? 
[03:28:00]  I sit every morning for 20 minutes, no matter what.  How do you just get everything out of your head enough?  You don't get everything out of your head enough.  You let the shit float around.  The idea of meditation is to let the brain hit them.  The brain's like a monkey.  It's going to bounce around your fucking head.  It's going to go crazy.  It's going to say, fuck you.  Go to the refrigerator.  Why don't you hit that one more time before she leaves?  All kinds of shit.  While you're sitting in quiet time, the mind goes crazy.  You say, I can't leave until the alarm goes off.  Before you know it, three minutes in, you're like, oh shit, I'm meditating.  I give a mantra, a mass mantra, rum. 
[03:28:30]  If you repeat to yourself, rum, rum.  You focus on that.  Your mind can run away, but it'll come back gently.  I got a question.  I actually meditate.  How do I get more out of it?  Because I feel like I sit there, I'm like, what the?  You don't have to look for anything.  Really?  If the mind settles.  I focus on the mantra, and I'm able to get sort of still, and then I hear.  You don't have to get.  I go to a yoga studio, and there's traffic outside.  I hear a truck, or a dog barking.  I'm like, oh great, I'm out of my meditation. 
[03:29:00]  No.  You want to operate.  If you meditate regularly.  I'm a little intense with my meditation.  You carry it with you.  It sticks.  But it always sticks.  If you meditate regularly, you will walk out into the street, and the car horn will blow,  and you'll be like, call on blues.  But how do you?  And you have to, you want to live, you want to be in moving meditation.  And we're all moving towards moving.  You know, you play basketball, you've been in the zone.  Right.  You know what that is, right?  Sure.  So this idea of having an expansive mindset.  You see the ball coming, you catch it with your left hand, you put it to your right hand, 
[03:29:30]  you give it to your man, he dunks the ball.  Right.  I mean, if you're young and you still do that type of shit.  But I'm saying, I used to feel, you know, moments of complete, you know, be in the zone.  Well, you've been in the car, everything moves slow.  The world is moving that slow.  Right.  But the fluctuations of the mind separate you from the world.  So if you're driving your car, instead of missing how the fuck you got from A to B,  you see every flower.  And so what you want is to live in a meditative mindset.  And with that expansive mind, you can't get no money in the future. 
[03:30:00]  You can only get, or in the past, you have to get it in the present moment.  So being awake and present and focus make you better at everything you do.  What if you itch?  I always itch when I try.  I've tried to meditate.  Scratch, scratch.  You can.  You don't have to.  Fuck that.  Just scratch it.  But after a while, you know, like you'll want to swallow or you'll want to scratch.  You'll be like, oh, fuck it.  Because you'll be so content that, you know, you won't even swallow.  It's like a bomb going off in your head.  Just sit and be patient and the mind will settle.  One tip.  You're in meditation.  I mean, you're obviously doing the mantra, but is there anything else you can focus on 
[03:30:30]  and just try to really get more out of it?  I'm trying to get more out of it somehow.  If you sit, I promise you, the mind settles and the nervous system settles and the immune  system gets stronger and the brain functionality gets stronger and you become a more mindful  eater and you become a more meditative person.  And you don't get one, you don't get muscles out of one pushup.  You know what I'm saying?  You got to keep pushing up.  How long did it take you to get decent at it or to get comfortable?  I've been meditating for 20 years, but you know, my first meditation, my first experience, 
[03:31:00]  if anyone sits for 20 minutes, a long 20 minutes, the first five minutes could be  hectic, could be turbulent, but there'll be moments you'll say, oh shit, I'm meditating.  Then your mind will bounce around some more.  You're not supposed to say, oh shit, I'm meditating.  No, but you'll notice, it'll come to a second, you'll be like, wow, I'm really still.  Then your mind will bounce around some more and then it'll settle even more.  It'll transcend the thoughts even more.  You can't push the thoughts out.  Let the thoughts come and go.  At first you do an inventory. 
[03:31:30]  Shit's coming and you're listening and you're watching all the thoughts and you're assessing  them differently because it's not so emotional.  Because now just see the thoughts for what they are and they're not hurtful.  They're more hurtful when you're out in the world and you don't want the fluctuations  of the mind because they're the cause of all sickness and all sadness.  The nervous mind, the monkey mind.  So if the mind is still, the universe unravels, if the mind is fluctuating, that's why we drink,  to shut the fucking mind up.  We drink to calm the mind. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  You know, and we do things to calm the mind, but it's cloudiness or clarity.  Clarity is the greatest gift.  That's what God, it's this idea of God consciousness or Nirvana for Buddhists or Samadhi for yogis  or Takwa for Muslims or Christ consciousness.  I mean, everybody got a rap and they're all talking about be still and know all of them.  And the prophets knew it.  And now the scientists know it.  So now I just put in a book because it's my passion and the publisher wishes he had gave 
[03:32:30]  me the money.  I give it to charity.  Any fucking way.  They could have gave me the money.  You know, they gave me $8.50 a book.  They gave me $1.20 for this book.  Wow.  And now they're going to end up paying a lot more.  It's all going to charity.  Wow.  Good for you, Russell.  Wow.  Have you ever had really deep meditation experiences?  Because we'll have a talk after meditation.  Some of these people in this room, man, they're like on spaceships and stuff.  And I'm like, what?  You fuckers on space.  He means you.  No, no, no, no.  We don't meditate in this meditation room. 
[03:33:00]  I go once a week to a yoga studio.  You don't have to go to a class.  You meditate by yourself.  If your eyes are closed, you're quiet.  It's kind of cool to do it with a group.  And then we talk about it.  And their experiences are like, you know, over the top sometimes.  They're in a field with flowers.  I'm like, what?  I'm just trying to keep my thoughts out of my head for a little while.  You don't have to try to keep your thoughts out.  That's a bad misconception.  Just let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  See, I've always been afraid I couldn't get rid of my thoughts.  That's why I would just do it.  I have an itch.  I'm like, fucked up. 
[03:33:30]  End of meditation.  I would always stop.  No, you scratch.  I do like it.  I like it a lot.  It's helped me out, certainly.  So I'm really appreciative of you guys that let me on your show.  Well, I don't like that.  No, no.  I called.  I called everybody.  First of all, everybody said no.  So I think you should maybe.  Everybody said no.  Now they all said yes.  I mean, I sent the first teacher to Oprah, to Ellen, to Generous.  People with big mouth, I sent them.  People with big voices, I sent them meditation teachers.  Because I wanted them to spread.  I mean, if I give anything to the world.  Poetry is great.  Comedy is great.  Records are great. 
[03:34:00]  You know.  The movies.  I'm making a bunch of movies now.  And TV shows.  And having fun in Hollywood.  You know.  Right.  But if I could get meditation into schools.  And I'm working with the mayor now in Chicago.  About doing quiet time programs.  And if I can reduce violence and save lives.  Then it'll be a greater contribution than the other shit.  Are they going to fight you and say that's prayer?  Because Reagan tried to do that.  When they were trying to pull prayer out of schools.  When they were pulling it out.  Reagan said, well how about just give them quiet time.  Right.  Or meditate. 
[03:34:30]  Whatever he called it.  And they're like, no.  That's indicative of prayer.  Yeah.  Ronald Reagan had that.  Believe me.  I know.  I have a school in Africa that we lost all our funding.  I know a lot of our funding.  I know that people.  But sitting by yourself.  The Buddha would say.  And this is a religious idea.  He said, check for yourself.  Because fuck what the rabbi says.  Or the imam says.  Sure.  Yeah.  They'll tell you to put a nigga in the oven.  In a minute.  The mother would say.  You know.  In a minute.  A religious group.  Gang.  They'll do anything.  So what we need to do.  Is look inside. 
[03:35:00]  If we looked inside.  We'd say.  40 billion animals.  Born into suffering.  Is that dominion over the animals?  Really?  Born to suffer.  To cause cancer.  Did you hear the new shit about beef?  I know they're going to get me.  They're going to shoot me in the back of the head.  Oh no.  You heard right?  No.  That if you have beef.  As 30% of your animal protein.  Of your protein.  It's like 20 cigarettes a day.  Holy shit.  And that was on the news.  That was on Dr. Sanjay.  I was on Fox and Friends.  I was on Dr. Oz. 
[03:35:30]  I mean I was on these shows.  It was a topic for discussion for a few days.  This book has been a bestseller seven weeks.  So seven weeks ago.  This came out.  Right then.  When I first.  The first day of my book tour.  And that's when news came out.  And everybody talked about it.  Even Fox and Friends was talking about this shit.  And now it's gone.  Now you know you should knock on everybody's doors.  Yo.  Don't feed your kids steak.  The beef industry got to them.  Huh?  Probably.  I don't think they got to them.  People just stopped talking about it.  Uh huh.  Do you eat meat? 
[03:36:00]  Oh no.  I've been a vegan for a long time.  Oh that's right.  You are.  We know that.  I'm sorry.  I don't eat animals.  We do know that.  I'm 90.  I got.  You know what?  I date younger women.  I got to keep my shit in order.  I can't fall apart.  You know.  You become look 90.  I can't do that.  Are you ever going to settle down Russell?  I've settled.  Yeah.  I have two beautiful daughters.  Nice.  I'm having a wonderful ex-wife.  You know.  And I would.  I would do it again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know.  Right now.  That's a good way to put it though.  I date younger women.  I got to keep my shit in order. 
[03:36:30]  That really is the motivator.  What page is that in your book?  I got to keep my shit in order.  I write my books.  Sometimes I use honest language in people like.  That's good though.  My second book is super rich.  I said something about Krishna and Arjuna.  The battle.  On the battlefield for the savedness community.  And Arjuna says, I want to go meditate.  And Krishna says, fuck that.  Go chop them niggas heads off right now.  Do your dharma.  Do what's in front of you.  Although it may be uncomfortable.  This is your dharma. 
[03:37:00]  This will bring you to spirit.  You know.  To God.  And so.  And even yogis.  Imagine.  Right.  They still tell my chopping heads off.  But.  Right.  He basically said that.  And I wrote it like that.  And I kept laughing about it.  Every time I read that.  As you're writing a book.  You know.  You write.  You know.  What you want to write.  And then you edit it.  And you work on it.  And I kept coming to that part.  And saying.  Am I going to leave this shit?  Yeah.  And I left it.  And now one person complained.  Good for you.  One Indian came to me and said.  You know.  I finally understand the dharma in the Bhagavad Gita.  I finally now understand it's about dharma. 
[03:37:30]  I said.  Thank you.  You know.  He said.  That passage I wrote about.  You know.  Chopping niggas heads off.  Because that's what he basically said.  You know.  Go and do your work.  Go out in the world.  And do what's right.  You know.  And sometimes it's not.  Not so easy.  What do you think is the biggest misconception about you.  That you see in the news.  Or just the scuttlebutt around social media.  Well.  I don't know.  I mean.  Sometimes the black blogs.  They only like.  I don't understand why in the fuck they would say this.  I only like white women.  You know.  Oh really.  Yeah.  I mean.  I don't.  I date like African girls. 
[03:38:00]  You know.  From African.  I date.  You know.  I'll date a nice person.  I don't like people who eat a lot of animals.  If I can help it.  I don't like fur.  I don't like cigarettes very much.  At all.  Yeah.  But I know the things I don't like doesn't mean I won't do.  You know.  Right.  Right.  We don't know what we like.  We like nice people.  Sweet.  Compassionate.  Loving people.  And that's been my.  That was one thing that I got a lot of.  And I don't know what else.  I think people.  I'm pretty open.  Yeah.  I don't really get.  I get mean press.  But I don't.  You know.  Conservatives don't like me very much. 
[03:38:30]  I'm more progressive.  I'm somewhere to the left of Dennis Kucinich regarding politics.  You know.  I love helping people.  I believe in compassionate politics.  And I.  And I like to.  You know.  Use my celebrity to help others.  And I like to get others to use their celebrity to help others.  Like.  We write a letter.  And that's what I discovered.  This.  It's not new to you.  But it's kind of shocking.  We wrote a letter to the Attorney General.  And everybody signed it.  You know.  NWCP.  The Urban League.  All the Latino.  This was about the prison industrial complex.  The Drug Policy Alliance.  All these kind of people. 
[03:39:00]  Harry Belafonte.  The great civil rights activist.  Brad Pitt.  And a bunch of Hollywood.  You know.  Stars.  You know.  Charlize Theron.  Whoever.  Everybody signed it.  Got a little bit of press.  We want to change the drug laws.  Justin Bieber tweeted that bitch out.  The Attorney General called.  Hello?  Oh.  The Attorney General.  Because shit gets popped.  It's a real problem.  Right.  And the same thing happened with Kim Kardashian tweet out.  I'm Muslim for a day.  When we were fighting against the Muslim inquiries that they were having in Congress.  They shut Congress down.  Because Kim Kardashian said so. 
[03:39:30]  That's true.  Because they don't want it to go too pop.  You know.  They don't want an idea that needs changing.  The discussions with the drug laws.  The first time when all the rappers came out.  We had the big rally.  The governor.  The Republican governor.  Gave me the pen when he signed the bill.  To let a lot of people out of prison.  Because he realized it was unjust and unfair.  And the world was finding out.  So.  I think it's important to get celebrities to pay attention when you can.  Because they.  They can move to me.  In this day and age.  In a second.  Most important two people in the world.  Kim Kardashian. 
[03:40:00]  And Justin Bieber.  Unbelievable.  They'll get things done for you.  Did you always want to help people?  Or was there something that happened in your life?  To set you down this road?  You get old.  Over a period of time you realize.  You know.  As you get older you become more.  Yeah.  You learn.  What makes you happy.  And making others happy.  But you seem like the type of guy that was always looking out for others.  Strangers and such.  I was always a nurturing person.  I mean I was a manager as a kid.  Right.  Always throughout.  All the rappers and all that stuff.  And I did that for a living.  But I find that.  You know.  That's just the gateway to your own happy. 
[03:40:30]  Selfish motivation.  Helping others helps you.  I always.  That's how I pay.  As a manager.  What do you do?  You get the guy hot.  He pays you a check.  Right.  Did you go through like a really selfish period though?  Like where you were just all about yourself?  I was high as fuck my whole childhood.  I mean until I was 30.  I was high as fuck.  I smoked a lot of angel dust.  Really?  We call it water.  The dumbest shit in the world.  Anything.  The only thing I missed that was a drug that everybody knows is bad for you is crystal meth.  Because I was too young.  When it came out I was old.  Oh right. 
[03:41:00]  So I missed the chance to be a crystal meth.  Oh damn.  Why don't you call it water?  We smoke.  We call it dust water.  I didn't know that in LA they called it water too.  I did a snoop show.  He said yeah every so often I used to take a dip in the pool too.  I said really?  That's what they say in LA?  He said yeah niggas used to take it.  That's Sherm.  But angel dust is really a very bad drug.  And that's why I remember shit.  Oh man.  Yeah.  I don't remember nothing.  You did it a lot?  I smoked a lot of dust.  I sniffed a lot of coke.  I smoked coke.  I smoked heroin.  I learned to smoke it on aluminum foil.  That was fun.  Like you ever put a chase the dragon?  You've seen that. 
[03:41:30]  Oh right.  With the straw and the little thing.  Oh yeah.  The little puff of smoke's coming up and it moves.  Yeah.  He looks like.  Oh I don't know what that is.  But then his face looks like I tried that.  And then I did it with hash oil.  You just take hash oil and put it on that.  It was the same kind of process.  And put the lighter underneath and it would bubble up and you'd smoke.  Yeah.  That's the only way I ever did heroin and smoking.  I was scared.  Oh shit.  But I did every drug.  And angel dust was my preferred drug.  Water.  Wow.  How does that make you feel?  A bundle of water.  Ten bags of dust.  What's that make you feel?  Dumb as fuck.  It's the same thing. 
[03:42:00]  It is like meditation because it's just cloudiness.  You know when the mind is empty.  And you know it's not fluctuate.  It's like empty.  You feel this bliss.  And this is why we do all these other things.  Like we do the physical practice of yoga.  We smile and breathe in every pose.  That's the practice.  And we meditate.  We want our mind to settle.  We do good karmic work.  We want our mind to settle.  We want our mind at ease.  Because when the mind is at ease, the universe, everything is beautiful.  A corpse and a sunset. 
[03:42:30]  Beauty.  You know.  But when the mind is fluctuating, it's always a fucking problem.  And that problem comes from the heart.  You know, the lack of consciousness.  So, that's true.  You don't yell?  You're not like a big yeller?  Not as much.  I used to yell.  I used to yell.  So, are you sober now?  I mean, what's your poison?  I'm sober now.  I don't drink smoke.  But how did you get off all that stuff if you loved it so much?  Well, because, you know, I was 30.  I had planned it my birthday.  That when I went to St. Bart's on January 1st, I was going to be sober. 
[03:43:00]  And I kept talking about it.  And I kept saying, January 1st, nigga.  Yo, I'm not fucking with you on January 1st.  And they wouldn't believe me.  And then I just did it.  You know, I woke up one day at a time.  You know?  And it was really an experience.  You know, it was an experience.  It taught me a lot about myself, being able to do that.  And that's 25 years ago now.  Wow.  26.  Damn, I'm old as fuck.  I've been sober longer than my girl that date had been alive.  And I was high longer than they were alive, too. 
[03:43:30]  Russell rules.  Oh, my God.  We're still breathing.  We're still happy to be breathing.  You're pretty open and honest.  I like that.  Did you go through withdrawals?  Was it really tough at first?  No, I didn't have any real addiction.  Like, you know, I didn't have really real addiction.  You know, it's hard to bring dust to St. Bart's.  I smoked that during that time.  And Coke, I was not addicted to.  You know?  I wasn't addicted to any drug.  I just took a lot of drugs.  Right.  I might have had a small addiction to Coke, but I wasn't really a smoker. 
[03:44:00]  You know?  Smoking is, like, obviously, you smoke Coke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Free base and all that shit.  That'll make you.  But I didn't have any.  It was psychologically addicted.  And so every day, for days, you know, I would say, yo, you want to get high?  Nah.  Y'all niggas, go ahead.  Were you a little apprehensive about maybe your creativity dropping off if you didn't do drugs?  Yeah, you know, there's a moment where your body does go through some withdrawal, and you might have to kind of freedom. 
[03:44:30]  Because what you do is you fuck your mind up, and then when you get sober, you're like, wow, you know, I'm alive.  You know?  Because it's such a bad experience, really, ultimately.  Mm-hmm.  But I didn't really have that experience, but I know that you can be cloudy, you know?  You can be cloudy, but that's for a minute, then your clarity sets in.  And the idea of clarity, you know, that's where everything comes.  Because only in a second of stillness can you really be creative or happy or anything.  I think a lot of artists' hugest fears about becoming sober is the fact that they would lose that creative edge that they have as far as acting or comedy or anything goes, music. 
[03:45:00]  They could have a second, you know, where they have to go through withdrawal, but it's not.  The truth is, clarity is where it all comes.  And when you're awake, and that's why I promote this awakened state, this idea is true, that all the prophets said it for a reason.  There is a taqwa, the Muslims refer to.  There is a Christ consciousness, nirvana.  There is samadhi for yogis. 
[03:45:30]  And there is, you don't have to be totally enlightened, right?  But you just want to be more and more open and more awake.  And this awakened state is a promise.  And I don't want to tell kids that, because it's not about that.  You can just ask the doctors, ask the neuroscientists, ask the, you know, what happens when the brain is settled.  What happens when you die?  What do you think?  That's a very tough question.  Of course it is.  I mean, for me, I believe God is like the ocean, and we're cups of God. 
[03:46:00]  That this idea of union is real.  And quantum physicists are proving it to some degree, that we're all connected.  So this collective consciousness that you are part of, your physical body doesn't separate you from it, but it's kind of, so I believe that, you know, this idea of being connected.  And you're just part of a bigger living, breathing entity.  Right, right.  That's God.  I don't have the idea, I don't know exactly what would happen.  Obviously, I don't have a strong belief system on what happens when you die.  But this idea of just being reborn into different bodies sounds good if you're a big, you know, I hope you're not born into a chicken that comes out, but it's not a problem. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, especially in Germany.  No, if you're born into a chicken, and you come out, and you're a girly chicken in a male chicken factory, as soon as you come out of the shell, they put you in the oven, fuck it, fuck it.  And then if you're a male in a female, a male in a female factory, it's all fucking, hey, animals, 40 billion, born into the worst suffering, it's not dominion over the animal.  Is that why you quit? 
[03:47:00]  Because I have an issue, I eat meat, but it is hard sometimes, I think of that, and I know the health risks.  Well, the 20 cigarettes a day should get you off beef, right?  I don't eat much beef, occasionally a steak, if I have a young lady friend, and I take her out for a steak.  You know what we'll do for a lady friend.  Red meat's like once a month, maybe.  Yeah, if that's all, you're okay.  Maybe.  But I would say that.  The chicken thing is brutal when you start looking at videos, and we all love chicken.  Yeah, usually you do.  So you quit 15 years ago, meat?  Yeah.  And what did you miss the most, and how long did you crave it? 
[03:47:30]  I didn't really crave it like that.  I didn't go, I didn't, you know, because it's so much, I just was lazy.  I'd be sitting next to a friend, and I would like, want to eat their shit, but if I had something in front of me that was good, I could survive.  And that's how I survived, by finding food.  And now, I live in L.A.  I'm here now, there's tons of vegan restaurants, and in L.A., they just keep sprouting up.  It's conducive.  Gourmet restaurants, all kinds of shit.  I mean, you can eat much better in L.A. than New York.  You can certainly eat much better vegan. 
[03:48:00]  They got veggie grill, they got a pastrami sandwich at this place called, it's not real pastrami, but big, fat-ass pastrami sandwich at a place called Native Food.  It's the most unbelievable thing in the world.  And they also have this crossroads in this gourmet place.  You can take a hot date, and she won't know what the fuck she's eating.  She'll just think it's whatever.  And it's kind of like fake stuff, but they don't use a lot of soy.  They use pea protein and rice protein and wheat, and you don't know when you're eating a chicken parmesan what the fuck you're eating. 
[03:48:30]  So that's really, you know, for a lot of people in transition, there's lots of great places.  Why do you say they don't use soy?  Is that bad for you?  Does that give you tits if you're a man?  Well, I don't know.  You know, I'm worried.  I'm doing a lot of push-ups, like in between chaturanga, I'm doing push-ups these days because I'm worried about, you know, I can't really have titties.  No, no.  What's worse than when you're hanging over a girl and you just see your tits drooping?  Oh, how embarrassing.  It's not like my nipples tweedled, too.  That's really an ugly scene.  But I'll pierce some bitches after that. 
[03:49:00]  What about sushi?  You eat sushi?  I do, but I eat, like, avocado rolls.  Spicy avocado roll's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, and there's all kinds of shit you can eat.  I mean, I always find stuff.  You go to Nobu, I was there the other day at a great deal.  You can find something almost everywhere nowadays.  Is it easier if you have the means, I mean, to be a vegan?  Unfortunately, having four or five green vegetable juices a day is $50.  Right.  I do that shit.  I don't think about it.  Give me a green juice.  Give me a double.  Give me a green juice with some apple.  You know, I'm always saying, give me a green juice. 
[03:49:30]  And, you know, that's $10 a hit.  Cheers.  Yeah.  You know, you got a green juice in front of you because you're rich.  Beats, spinach, kale.  Because you're rich.  You know how much beats and spinach and kale are in that juice?  That's a lot of shit.  That's right, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's a lot of money.  And it's unfortunate that we don't have alternatives that are accessible.  Why don't they in airports?  I think of that every time I travel because I fly so much.  I'm like, this is why we're a country of fat fucks because there's nothing in the airport that's...  There's a Dunkin' Donuts in that bitch.  Always.  But there's no good, like, healthy places.  Because people aren't buying that stuff, so... 
[03:50:00]  100%.  That's true.  It's the economics of the whole thing.  I see the Samsung.  I got the Note 3.  This big joint right here.  And this big...  The Note 3.  I love this shit.  I love it, too.  White glove, right?  Are you a white glove guy?  Oh, yeah.  Plus, they show up at your crib, fix your phone.  It's awesome.  They're amazing.  We're talking about privileged shit.  Right.  You know, I think it's funny about white people can't talk about privileged shit, but black people can.  No, no, for real.  Check this out.  Think about Gwena Paltrow, who's a lovely person.  She says, I'm eating dinner in this beautiful French restaurant in the south of France, and it's such and such, and you should try it. 
[03:50:30]  Nigga's like, fuck you talking about, bitch.  I'm starving.  You talking about trying it?  They get really angry, like, how the fuck dare you talking about this restaurant you know I can't go to?  Right.  And Jay-Z and Beyonce will close that bitch down.  You can't go there if you want to.  They will sit in the window of the motherfucker.  Right?  They will sit in the window, eat in that French restaurant.  The chef will stand over them, and people will come by and wave and cheer.  No one will be mad.  Right?  Because I guess, you know, coming from a struggle allows you that freedom.  But if you're in a second generation, you might not know. 
[03:51:00]  You say he's black.  Let him enjoy it.  Fuck it.  White people.  How dare you eat in that restaurant knowing I can't get there?  Isn't it true?  And I thought about the criticism of her being so cruel and so unusual and mean.  It was sort of unnecessary.  It's all the time.  It's all the time.  You know, because she mentioned the wrong restaurant.  Yeah.  You know.  I mean, plus, remember the niggas in Paris thing?  Oh, my God.  She was with the niggas in Paris.  She shouldn't have said it.  And I said, but give her a pass.  Come on.  Right, right, right.  She said, I'm with the, she's with Kanye and Jay.  Yeah, yeah.  She said, I'm with the niggas in Paris. 
[03:51:30]  And she tweeted that.  I was, whoa, that an ex.  That was her Harriet Tubman.  Wait, is that a quote?  That was her moment, you know, where she's like, I made a mistake.  What's the quote?  What was the quote?  She simply said, I'm with the niggas in Paris.  And she showed a picture of her and Kanye and Jay.  I saw the tweet.  I saw the tweet.  And I was like, damn, she's in Paris, bitch.  I was just jealous.  Right, right.  You didn't think like, oh, shit.  The next day, boy.  And a little bit of trouble.  But is niggas in Paris a song?  Huge song.  They played the song like 5,000.  At the end of the show, they played that song like 5,000 times. 
[03:52:00]  Okay.  They both have an enormous number of hit records, right?  Obviously, their library is ridiculous.  The song, niggas in Paris, that comes on in a concert.  People can start going fucking crazy.  It's a huge record.  And so that was the name of the tour.  And the name of the show in Paris was obviously niggas in Paris.  Right, right.  And she was there with them and said that.  And man.  Name of the album.  Did she apologize or no?  She.  No.  I would hope not.  Well, no.  I would think that it's just if I'm like me. 
[03:52:30]  If I offended anybody, I'm sorry.  You know.  But I don't believe.  By the way, I don't think.  If you don't have a slave directly in your ancestry that you can point to, then you can't probably use the word.  Like you guys can't.  Unless I gave you my rabbinical supervision.  If I allowed you to say it once, you could.  But then I wouldn't do it.  Because then tomorrow we'd be talking about it.  You'd be like, hey, man.  We don't want that pressure.  I think it's intention.  I'm more worried about if people have honest and sweet hearts than if they, you know, use language that, you know, is colorful. 
[03:53:00]  I think a lot of words now are looked at just verboten regardless of context.  And a lot of times the context has nothing to do with hate speech.  There's no good way to say fag.  I didn't mean fag.  There's no good.  And it's not like my nigga.  You can't say my fag.  So there's no really good way.  I say it every morning when I see these two.  But you can't.  No, you can't.  Watch the gay ACP will get you.  Yeah, yeah.  But fag, when we were growing up, means, and I understand it's a vicious word.  But his wife's vicious because whatever it means, it's mean, it's like, oh, you're just a fag. 
[03:53:30]  And so I didn't mean you were gay, but you meant soft, weak, these things.  And, you know, it kind of ties into there's no way out.  You know, there's no real explanation for that word because it doesn't have any.  There's no my nigga.  That's my nigga.  I love when you say if I come to my group, a group of people, white and black, who know me, right?  I say, niggas.  And they'll look at me and say, niggas what?  They're saying, like, what do you mean?  Are you happy today?  So they won't know. 
[03:54:00]  But if I walk you through them, I say, faggots, they'll be like, oh, he's pissed.  He's not happy today.  There's nothing nice about it.  But that can be, and I'm not even saying it's a nice word.  It's an awful word.  But it can be an affectionate thing, like with your friends, where you don't mean, like, you know, I'm not going to do this.  Don't be, come on, you faggot.  Like, when people aren't trying to be hateful when they say it.  You ain't got a lot of trouble.  You better watch it.  But you know what I mean?  There can be a way.  But he didn't mean it gay, but it does, and it doesn't, and without thinking about it, doesn't mean.  But there's nothing good about it.  You just can't, you can't punish people because there was always a social justice. 
[03:54:30]  But I wouldn't punish anybody for that, you know, but I'm not, you know, the judge.  I'm not the judge by the world.  It is odd that so many people call for firings and all kinds of repercussions when somebody trips up.  But people are born into a life of unequal treatment.  They live an entire life, and the world won't change before they die.  That their entire community is under the gun. 
[03:55:00]  They're born into a life where they will be unequal, no matter how much work they do to change it.  They're going to die, and this world will still treat them unequal.  And that's a very, very heavy weight to carry.  Women, too.  You know, the president, they fought this motherfucker.  All he wanted to say, give the bitches as much as we get.  Pay them what we get as men.  They should certainly have equal pay.  And the Republicans are fighting him and fighting him.  He just said, give them equal pay. 
[03:55:30]  Maybe we should start at the White House, where they're paid 80% of what the men are paid.  At the White House.  Well, that's okay.  I get that point, too.  It's everywhere.  Women are unequal.  And it's unfair.  It's wrong.  You know, gays are unequal.  It's unfair.  It's wrong.  You know, African Americans, in many cases, are judged unequal, you know, and unfair.  You know, so we want the world to be, we want to give everybody the same thing we want for ourselves.  Whatever we think we want for ourselves, give it to other people. 
[03:56:00]  Aren't there some instances of you get what you pay for kind of a thing in, like, women's equality as far as pay goes and jobs and whatnot?  Well, that's not enough, and they work hard enough.  They should get at least as much as we get.  Aren't there certain responsibilities that men have inherently and have had responsibilities over the years that sort of almost give a pass, like, look, we're the ones that go to war and have over the years.  But we're not the one necessarily who's smart in a particular office place.  I mean, I think if you're a, I don't even know how to express it. 
[03:56:30]  I just totally feel that women should get equal pay for equal work, you know, and that's all I'm saying.  But a lot of times the equal work thing is kind of mixed up.  I know if I'm on the fifth floor of a burning building and a fireman's coming up the stairs to get me, I want it to be a big, bruising guy that's going to...  Like the girl on the throne.  You want that girl on the throne?  I saw her in a restaurant the other day. 
[03:57:00]  Wow.  When she bowed because she was too fucking, she didn't know how to curtsy on the throne, so she bowed, yes.  But that, being judged on ability, is fine like that.  There being some type of quota just because there aren't enough women firefighters, so you take people that might not be as good at the job as somebody else just to make a quota.  That, to me, gets dangerous.  I don't have a comment or a, I don't have a strong understanding of, I feel like I can comment on that.  I mean, a woman police officer, you know, a woman fireman, a woman... 
[03:57:30]  I don't like a woman greeter.  I honestly...  Really?  Because then I'm not giving her my bag.  If you, if somebody, you know, another privileged thing, you know, you go to the airport, I don't fly private, I have a greeter.  The greeter meets me.  Uh-huh.  And she says, can I take your bag?  I said, no, fuck no.  I'm going to carry this bag.  Right.  You know, and that, then I can't use my BlackBerry because I'm carrying my bag.  And I, and I, thank you so much, and I, and I secretly discriminate in my brain, and I secretly tell my man, yo, send me a dude, man, so I give my bag. 
[03:58:00]  Like, can I give a woman my bag?  Right.  Because I'm taught not to do that in my mind.  I want to be respectful.  So that is, you know, I understand your point.  I don't know how to do it.  When I'm getting my hair shampooed at the, at the hair place, I want a girl.  And it's just the fact that I don't like...  That's not right.  Why?  I don't like why.  Because if there's a guy, he's going to get a heart on you.  I honestly just don't like the feeling of a guy, like, massaging my scalp like that.  He's a homophobe.  Your man right there. 
[03:58:30]  That's right.  It's not so much homophobe.  It's not even a homophobe.  He's going to get a heart on you.  Absolutely.  He's going to get a heart on you.  Oh, my God.  Work with me.  It's not as much, it's not so much a homophobe thing.  In this day and age, you ain't got to live and die without fulfilling your thing.  Do your thing, baby.  No, it's just...  Just pop one in your mouth.  It's so much.  Oh, my God.  Honestly.  Do you say, like, homophobic stuff often?  Well, not even homophobic, because he's saying, like, English...  I am all for...  I love gay marriage.  I fucking love it.  He loves it.  Get married.  Yeah.  I understand your point.  I'm saying, when they have it totally equal, when you come out, it'll be late. 
[03:59:00]  You won't even be able to fuck then.  Yeah.  I understand.  I understand.  You get a male hairdresser then when it's really free.  Also, you haven't had your hair shampooed in years.  You're out of this discussion.  Right.  But I'd rather have a woman giving me a nice, like, massaging shampoo.  Yeah, I'm with you on that one.  I understand that instinct more.  And it's not...  It honestly isn't a...  Or it doesn't come down to being a sexual thing.  It's just uncomfortable for me to have a guy touching me in kind of a matter that I feel... 
[03:59:30]  If you're going to get a happy ending, then I believe it should be a happy ending.  Okay.  All right.  Right.  But if you're not going to get a happy ending, nostalgia, even anything, it's fine by me.  They can touch me.  I think it comes down to a little nurturing, too.  You like when a woman is kind of nurturing you a little bit.  It's nice and young.  I'm all right with a guy shampooing my hair, but I'd rather have a female.  Oh, and they have to be white.  You know, I like...  With big boobs in a sample.  Don't forget the big breasts, too.  That helps. 
[04:00:00]  Well, yeah.  I like...  Well, if I'm going to get my hair done, if you're talking about breasts now, I'm going  to like a woman's breasts.  Well, of course.  If they're going to be bent over me, I'm going to look at them boobs in my face.  I prefer a massage...  If I get a guy to massage me and I really don't like to, I prefer...  It's back only.  I only allow them to do my back.  You don't like them fondle your balls?  No.  But if a woman...  Even if she won't fondle my balls, I'm always hoping that a finger will slip up.  And if a guy does it...  You're hoping it won't.  Exactly. 
[04:00:30]  Especially if he's bigger than me and can force the issue.  But then it kind of removes that fun element because it's like standing back.  It doesn't seem fun at all.  I just think there are certain things that you do kind of want a woman doing and other  things you would like a man doing.  I said just a happy ending, but a massage.  I'm not afraid of a dude rubbing it in my back.  I'm not kidding.  You know, as long as he's a good masseuse, I do...  I get it.  I get it.  I get it to a point.  But this is why I like Russell, though, because Anthony raised the point about firemen and  cops, and you're like, yeah, yeah, I don't know how I feel about that either. 
[04:01:00]  I like when somebody isn't so stuck on the argument that they argue...  Instantly have the other side.  Yeah, but I love the fact that you're like, yeah, that's a good point.  It's a good point.  I mean, I don't know how to deal with that.  But I do know that, you know, in the office place where women are doing, I know, smart  women, I elevate them all the time.  I have girls running companies.  And, you know, I've taken from interns to presidents, many women.  And I've seen them all go out into the industry and do well in various different industries.  I had an intern.  Now she's the head of Fox Pictures.  I had an intern, you know, God knows, I have lots, Leo Collins, and she's where you get 
[04:01:30]  your interns.  Yeah, her interns.  Oh, my God.  Barely make it through the semester.  Kevin Lyles.  Kevin Lyles was a street team member, but he's a guy.  But when I watch people go out into the world, and women, a lot of women, too.  Julie Greenwald was an intern.  Now she's the most powerful woman in the record business.  Jesus.  That's amazing, yeah.  Amazing.  Good.  Yeah, no, I...  Well, we've got to take a break.  This has been amazing.  Russell's fantastic.  Well, listen, I just want to give you a last pitch.  I want to say this.  Yeah, please.  The reason I wanted to come on here and talk about meditation or quiet time is because it 
[04:02:00]  is the greatest gift I can give.  I mean, all the poetry and comedy and financials and all that shit's fine.  But for a quiet mind, everybody's looking for it.  They're doing everything they can possibly do.  They're taking every drug.  They're playing basketball.  They're going running.  They're doing all kinds of stuff.  Just because it feeds the brain a minute, a second of stillness.  And meditation is the greatest gateway to happiness and stillness.  And the neuroscientists tell you it's true.  And it's important.  And it's simple.  And it's been taught for thousands of years. 
[04:02:30]  And now there's so much research and so much reality in our face.  I want to put it in schools.  I want kids to meditate.  And I want, you know, I want to improve the world.  The world meditated to be a nicer place.  Nice.  And it's not a, it's like a, it's bigger than a pocketbook, but it's like a nice size book.  And it's just called Success Through Stillness.  And I'm actually going to read this because we talked about meditation and I can't do it.  But I'm going to try to do it.  It's very simple.  I'm going to try to do it.  Anybody can meditate.  Anybody can learn to meditate.  It's really that simple.  I'm thrilled at success.  I mean, seven weeks in the bestseller chart. 
[04:03:00]  And Oprah's show hasn't aired.  I don't know what the fuck's going to happen when her show ends.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm really excited that it's getting out there and it's affecting people.  She's nice, right, Oprah?  Oh, she's wonderful.  She's asked me to come on her show several times.  She's the reason I'm an author.  Oh, really?  She has not.  What'd you say?  I said she's asked me to come on her show several times.  She has not.  Are you doing funny as fuck?  Oh, she hasn't really?  No, of course not.  I was hoping you'd drop my name to her.  You guys are pretty big, though.  You guys are big.  We're doing all right.  Big following.  Our old boss now works for Oprah.  Eric Logan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[04:03:30]  He's like, basically...  Yeah, but he could work for you now, too, though.  No, it's Oprah.  He knew when to jump ship.  Yeah.  It's basically Oprah and then him, Eric Logan.  Oh, I see.  He's like, he's a big deal over there now.  Yeah, he brought me into her office when she wasn't there, and he's like, this is where  Oprah sits.  I'm like, really?  He goes, yeah, yeah.  Come out.  Come out.  Come out.  Just in case you showed up early.  I've got to say something about her.  All of our employees must love her, because I see the way she treats them.  But I want to say this about her.  She has done more to affect the collective consciousness regarding subjects like meditation or real spirituality, 
[04:04:00]  spirituality, which is at the core of all these religious gangs.  In the core, she has looked to promote consciousness in a way.  With her celebrities, she has changed her lives and helped the lives of so many hundreds of thousands, millions of people.  She's the queen of American consciousness.  She's taken all those books.  She sold 40 million copies of Eckhart Tolle's books.  40 million.  And his book was about happiness, and selling happiness through spirituality is the only 
[04:04:30]  one route to happiness.  Right.  It's a quiet mind and a spiritual mind.  The other stuff is short-term.  So the only happiness there is is this, and Oprah's been very good at giving it to people,  so that's special.  Nice.  Russell Simmons.  Good luck with the book, man.  Absolutely.

[04:10:00]  Coming up this week on At The Movies with Norton and Voss, the guys review the latest Liam Neeson thriller, Taken 2.  It was awful.  It was great.  It stunk.  It was fucking great how he just beat everybody up.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage.  Don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big dad!  Stepdad have pony! 
[04:10:30]  And then at the end, he brings the fucking big singer.  I saved her life.  It was fucking horrendous.  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good, yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up on the next At The Movies with Norton and Voss.  Clean the bowl with your song.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Russell Simmons was great. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah, he was very good.  He was a lot of fun, man.  I love Russell.  Absolutely.  He's a good guest.  And I really did love when he said, like, when Ant made a great point, he didn't, like, blindly defend his angle.  He was like, oh, yeah, you know, that's kind of, I don't know how to feel about that.  Like, I love that he did that.  Right.  That's the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that makes everything the guy says believable.  Like, all right.  He has his beliefs.  He puts his money where his mouth is.  And he's a reasonable guy. 
[04:11:30]  He's not one of these unreasonable, just going to argue because it's what he's supposed to say.  Oh, yeah.  He isn't reasonable.  Is he reasonable?  This is Masood.  Masood in Ontario.  Masood, it looks like.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Amen.  Love the show, man.  Thank you.  Just wanted to get your opinion about what Russell was saying about the word faggot.  You know, I've heard it dropped on the show a couple times.  But, you know, it's all in jest and just, you know, in good humor. 
[04:12:00]  But he seemed to think that there was no good context around it.  But he seemed to be dropping bitch quite frequently.  And I'm just wondering what you think on that.  Is there a good context around that?  Oh, it's funny you should say that because as soon as the interview ended, he goes, am I in trouble?  And then he goes, oh, man, I said bitch a lot, didn't I?  Yeah, yeah.  Or something like that, he said.  Yeah, right.  But if you ask Russell, but this is why I like him, because if you said that to him, he would probably think about it and explain why he said it and go, like, yeah, maybe that's not good either. 
[04:12:30]  Like, he would probably at least reasonably consider what you just said.  And that's the thing, right?  Like, so certain words, you know, what he was saying.  And I think, you know, I think he was a little incorrect in saying that there's no good context around the word faggot.  I kind of disagree because, really, there's no good, you know, context around the word bitch, right?  But I don't know.  Probably if you look at it the same way, I would think you're right.  Or even though you can say my nigga, which he said, I mean, if you really got into it, is the comfortable, familiar tone of that, does that outweigh the negative, vicious connotation of that word? 
[04:13:00]  Probably not.  Exactly.  But whatever.  I mean, he's, I, you know.  And you said the word to him.  I got scared.  It's crazy.  Why?  I was actually, it was a legitimate question.  Jimmy's a mad man.  I got scared.  That was a legitimate question.  Of course.  He said it, niggas in Paris, and I've literally never heard that.  Uh-huh.  Is that a, I didn't know it was a song.  That's a huge song, yeah.  Yeah, it's a monster song.  But I asked him at first, is that something, and he didn't answer it. 
[04:13:30]  So I just said, is niggas in Paris a song.  I didn't know why she would tweet that.  I'm like, what, is she crazy?  Right.  But that wasn't, I didn't feel weird saying that.  That's the fucking name of the tune.  No.  He basically said if there's, if it's coming from a good place, he's all, he's all right with stuff like that.  Right?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  It's a complicated issue.  I thought I'd call in, first time caller, love the show.  I just hate the fucking word, uh, the word, the word police, da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  I just can't stand that whole thing.  And I think any, any word, um, you, you can say and, and have a context. 
[04:14:00]  Like hullabaloo.  I think it's okay.  Hullabaloo is a good one.  And I don't think it's homophobic at all to want a woman to shampoo your hair.  No, I was just teasing you.  Oh, I know.  But I, I think, um, I am, I really, I'm a lot of things, but boy, uh, homophobic, I'm not.  I, I really don't have any problem with gays doing whatever the fuck they want to do.  I don't get uncomfortable when gay people are in the room, like Sam or, but I, uh, he fucking 
[04:14:30]  meant you, peck a sucker.  You think he was being, you think he was being genuine though?  You sit down and get your hair shampoo and it's going to be a guy.  You're telling me Russell doesn't think about it at all.  Exactly.  It's a, I mean, is he okay with it?  I, I, I, it seems like it, yes, but I think he's okay with it.  Yeah.  Or is it just, you're supposed to be okay with it, but do you genuinely feel better when  it's a woman than a guy?  But you notice, I'm not going to jump out of the chair and go, fuck this, I'm out of  here.  But you notice and you, and you know, and if it's a woman, you settle in a little better, 
[04:15:00]  I guess, I don't know.  Right.  And, and if it's a very attractive woman, isn't that even better?  Like there's just the thing and it's, it's just a basic male thing.  I've had massages, uh, from men here and there and it's, and you don't relax as much.  Do tell.  But you don't relax as much.  It's just, it just is.  Sure.  It's a finger up the asses for you.  Absolutely.  You feel that thick, solid, untapered finger.  You just feel, you just, you just feel their man calluses and just. 
[04:15:30]  I do not want a guy fucking massaging me.  I've had, and you don't, you don't, you don't relax as much.  I don't know.  You're, you're on guard or something.  I don't know.  I don't even know how to explain it.  What if it moves?  I mean, what if, what do you do when?  When it starts jumping under the towel?  Word.  You're embarrassed and it's, oh, tell.  Let's go to Todd in Virginia.  Todd.  Tell.  Toddy.  Hey, what's up?  You guys suck.  Yes. 
[04:16:00]  What?  What?  Um, hey, I just want to.  No, I said what?  Cause I didn't hear you.  So say it again.  What?  I said, I said, what's up?  You guys suck.  Why?  Well, that's because, I don't know.  I've been listening to you guys for a long time, man.  I'm 26 years old.  I'm listening to you guys now.  Cause I, I've been sober for two years.  I got a couple of shekels in the pocket.  I can afford the XM radio.  Nice.  Okay.  Um, I, I, I, I was listening to you guys when I was in the eighth grade, about 13 years  old when nine 11 happened.  And, uh, you guys were, I was listening to you guys shaped my whole fucking sense of humor 
[04:16:30]  growing up.  And I, I just really appreciate having you guys back in my life right now.  It's the old school you suck.  You guys have a fucking laugh at my ass off.  Oh, thank you.  Like us.  Okay.  I thought you would like us for a second.  It's the old school.  You guys suck.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I used to say.  And, uh, Jimmy, I went and saw you a few years back, do your HBO special on Anglewood.  It was fucking hilarious, man.  Oh, thank you, man.  Shit, hilarious.  And, um, you know, I just want to shower you guys with compliments.  You guys are fucking awesome.  I wish everybody was like you guys.  And, and, and man, I, I'm, I'm sure as hell glad I get to listen to you guys again, because, 
[04:17:00]  uh, I used to come home from fucking school and you guys would fuck me up at a young age  listening to you, but it was, it was the fucking best.  So thank you for what you guys are doing, man.  You guys will.  Thanks a lot, man.  Oh, let me say hi to, uh, Nick in Niagara Falls.  Nick.  What's going on, guys?  Hello, Nick.  Oh, okay.  Uh, the, I just wanted to, uh, yeah, yeah.  Uh, plead my case, uh, to try and get you to a block me from Twitter. 
[04:17:30]  I have never blocked a person on Twitter, so I don't know what you're talking about.  Okay.  It's just my, it's just my, it's just my, it's just my, it's just my, it's just my, it's just  Wait, who blocked you?  Who blocked you?  Me, I guess.  Oh, the old, what'd you say?  What's your Twitter name?  They never do anything bad.  At, I'm Craig Schinkle.  Oh, okay.  I didn't block you.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  What'd you say?  Just Opie.  What'd you say?  You got me on a bad day there, Opie.  What'd you say, though?  Oh, uh, I don't know.  I don't even remember.  Yeah, neither do I. 
[04:18:00]  I don't believe that.  What did you say, sir?  Oh, I, it was when, uh, Lady Di was in and you were talking about her, uh, credit and  her liens and whatnot.  And, uh, I thought it was a little uncalled for.  Oh, he was the guy.  It was equally uncalled for.  You have a very good name, though.  I don't even know how to find you on Twitter.  Is that Craig Schinkle?  How do you spell your name?  Craig Schinkle.  Uh, it's I-M-C-R-E-G-G-S-H-I-N-K-E-L. 
[04:18:30]  Schinkle.  S.  I'm Craig Schinkle.  That's correct.  H.  Schinkle about it.  E.  Don't Schinkle about it.  Who the hell is that?  S.  H-E.  S-H-I-N-K-E-L.  I.  Schinkle.  Craig Schinkle.  Stop, Craig Schinkle.  I'm Craig Schinkle.  S-H-E-I.  No.  I'll just forget it.  I, I'll do it.  I am, I am the two letters. 
[04:19:00]  Letters, I am Craig C-R-E-G-G-S-H-I-N-K-E-L.  S-C-H-I-N-K-E-L.  S-C-H-I-N-K-E-L.  I'll show it to you.  Oh, my God.  All right, I'll just unblock you.  Fuck it.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  I'm going to block, I'm going to unblock everyone today.  Oops.  Oh, wow.  Because I just feel after that Russell Simmons interview that I, it's just the right thing to do.  No results found.  I'll figure it out.  Thanks, Nick. 
[04:19:30]  Love you.  See you, Craig.  Let's go to Kevin in Houston.  I appreciate it.  Kevin.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Oh, shut up.  Don't yell Kevin that way.  Is it C-R-E-G-G?  Yes, that's how it's spelled by name.  And then C-S-C-H-Y?  I-N-K-E-L.  K-E-L.  Yeah, I don't have...  Shit.  No, it's I-M, Craig Schenkel.  The letters I am first.  I-A-M, right?  No, I am.  Just two letters.  I am.  Oh, all right.  This guy's going to get a lot of followers today.  My God. 
[04:20:00]  I'm shook about it.  I don't know.  Okay.  All right.  Anyway, what do you got, Kevin?  Yeah, hi, Kev.  I was just curious as to why our friends from the North have decided to put on their Facebook  page that we were instructed by Opie and Anthony to attack their Facebook page and call  their radio show when I don't remember that ever being said on the radio.  God, of course it doesn't.  All these guys just lie through their teeth.  Of course they do.  Right through them.  We got a very rabid fan base, and they did it on their own. 
[04:20:30]  I thought it was their fans giving them a head and putting our pictures up in and make  us look bad.  Am I right or wrong, Sam?  Just chipping you.  Wrong.  Gotcha.  Leave me alone.  Oh, your character's annoying today.  I know.  I'm sorry.  They are.  I'm just tired.  I haven't shaved my head in a while.  Oh, yes.  Anyway, the people have been bashing my hairdo.  I've heard you.  Really?  Why?  I don't know.  The lesbian.  And my favorite is Jamie Lee Curtis and the shit yogurt commercials. 
[04:21:00]  You're right.  You've been heard.  Oh, my God.  Is that the worst one?  That's very funny.  That's kind of funny, man.  You could slam me all day.  I don't mind it.  I know it's awful.  That's a good one.  Believe me, I know it.  He's doing it for something.  Yes, of course.  Or at least we're all hoping.  Yeah.  I'm in a midlife crisis.  Oh, man.  What do you think?  I want to be George Pappard?  Was there another one that was up there?  Yes, I couldn't think of his name, the Dracula, George Hamilton.  No, another comment that was either hurtful or...  Oh, none of them were hurtful.  Did any of them almost get to you? 
[04:21:30]  No.  Not about my physical.  Physical stuff.  You look like a cunt or a faggot or your hair is...  I make my living doing that.  Sometimes I'll get a good line out of it and keep it.  Exactly.  I said that on stage last night.  I was just quoting what people have called me.  Yeah.  And I said the lesbian thing.  And when I said the Jamie Lee yogurt and the shit commercial, people fucking clapped.  See, that's funny.  Then I talked about Jamie Lee Curtis and her big clit and it got a big silence.  Oh, really?  Didn't go too well?  No.  I do enjoy her shit yogurt commercials. 
[04:22:00]  Shit yogurt.  Where you look at her and she just finally gave up on looking like a woman anymore.  What's the matter?  What are you doing?  Are you feeling your rod?  I don't have a rod.  Oh, good.  Let's do this right now.  Oh, God.  I'm trying.  I got some blubber.  You want to pump my stomach?  Could you at least cut your hair like that before you shave it?  That's as big.  I don't know if you can.  You have to do a few iterations.  I want to grease my hair back. 
[04:22:30]  Please cut it like that, please.  And then just have yogurt.  Well, we have to bring in some hair gel.  Yeah.  Yeah, we could probably work that out.  And you've got to get our yogurt.  Tomorrow.  And just redo that exact shot.  Yeah, you should have a smart blazer on.  You've got to do a smart blazer.  Man clothes.  This woman gave up.  Our tits in fucking trading places were stunning.  They were not hers, by the way.  That was a body double.  No way.  No, I saw it.  It was. 
[04:23:00]  Okay.  Because her head was on it.  Wait, what's the truth there?  No, it wasn't.  She was, yeah, because it was a full frontal.  Her face.  No, I know.  Her body and everything.  She had amazing tits.  She had a great body.  They were heavy.  Remember?  They were heavy, but not saggy.  It was a natural.  Heavy, not saggy.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Oh, what do you call it?  Heavy, not saggy.  Heavy, not saggy?  T-shirt.  Oh, I know, but it just, it doesn't seem.  No?  I'll sit with it for a little while.  It sounds like a food thing.  It's heavy, not saggy.  People aren't.  Like a slogan.  Oh, my friend has a good slogan he wanted me to give you. 
[04:23:30]  I don't know if you'll like it.  What?  Always remember the shingle powders.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  Let's go to Sal.  Jesus.  That is so annoying to me.  I know.  I chill.  I chilled that time.  I got like a...  Let me tell you how sad it is.  We're going to the phones, and this guy has nothing.  Sal, go ahead.  He's calling from inside the room.  Oh, that one. 
[04:24:00]  The bearded Sal.  Yes.  Hey, Sal.  Who's good on the computer, by the way.  Oh.  So I called in a couple weeks ago.  I was the open line.  Congratulations.  That's cool.  Gives a shit.  Yeah, more about you, Mr. Bigshot.  Go ahead, Mr. Bigshot.  He called last week with what, though?  Do we even remember?  Who cares, though?  In his world, it's everything.  It's the greatest thing ever.  Guys, we're just...  Sorry, Sal.  We love you.  Sally.  We love you, mister.  You know the deal.  Let's go.  I just need a good fucking... 
[04:24:30]  I need something to bring the love you, miss you thing together for the t-shirt.  Oh, that's a good one.  I'm thinking a heart with a sad face.  Love you, miss you.  But then the heart, then the guys aren't going to wear the heart shirts.  No, that's true.  I got graphic design artists that want in on this shit.  Working 24 hours?  Well, send me your fucking logos for some wacky t-shirt ideas from the Opster, and I'll  pay handsomely for a good design.  I'm learning the t-shirt business.  Go to OPRadioFans on Facebook, probably the easiest way to get your designs. 
[04:25:00]  They're asking, so there you go.  Go ahead, Sal.  So I listened to them for about 10 minutes, and I only heard one funny joke.  So I decided to call in and give my opinion about the show, and I wasn't going to bash  them or anything.  I get on the show, and I'm like, you know, maybe you guys shouldn't be making claims  about a radio show that you listened to once.  I've listened to you guys once, and I'm not going to make any extraneous claims, but  I'm going to say, maybe you're not as funny. 
[04:25:30]  And I couldn't even use my opinion without them calling me a goober.  What the fuck is a goober?  Oh, wow.  A goober?  What was the other thing they said?  I already forgot.  Raisinette?  The silly...  Oh.  All right.  Fucking Paul Bunyan and the Blue Ox hung up on me.  That's funny.  Those fucks.  What was the one thing?  Snippy Snappy.  Snippy Snappy.  That's a good one.  Snippy Snappy and Goober.  We can't compete with that shit.  Your button's undone on your pants.  Oh, shit.  Why did you notice that?  I've been seeing it for an hour. 
[04:26:00]  What?  I don't button my pants.  The shit on their Facebook page.  Right.  The shit on their Facebook page is the funniest fucking stuff I've ever seen.  It's still up, though.  Oh, my God.  It's good stuff for them.  I respect the fact I didn't take it down.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'm a person for that.  Humble in Fred.  Lady Trucker.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hello, sir.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted you to know that the silver streaks in your hair are adorable.  Thank you.  God, you got a compliment from a monster.  How does that happen? 
[04:26:30]  You're a monster.  You know that, right?  Wow.  She's a delightful fan.  She's a dear.  I always mean the Lady Trucker.  Yeah, she's nice.  Because she's a monster.  Oh.  I want to actually gel it back.  Large marge.  Yeah.  I bet you that was it.  Sometimes I do it in the shower.  I'll shampoo it and gel it back.  And then I literally would look at myself in the mirror and go, what the fuck?  And I do Chip alone in the shower.  Oh, that's good.  You got to gel it back, definitely.  You need some hair product in that.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[04:27:00]  Why don't we go home?  Yeah, that sounds like a plan.  Matthew in Chicago.  We're going home.  But what do you got?  Matthew.  Matthew.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Later.  Hey, man.  I'm just calling real quick.  On behalf of all the callers who shouldn't be fucking callers, we are waste toys.  Can we just have a fucking show without the callers?  Jimmy, I love you, baby.  Frunkus.  Thank you, and I love you.  See, but then we would have missed that wonderful call if we didn't take callers anymore based  on your statement.  It worked.  Kind of a paradox.  I photobombed the Russell Simmons. 
[04:27:30]  Hold on a minute.  What?  Wait.  Did someone just send it?  Hold on.  Holy shit.  I just photobombed a Russell Simmons photo with some bra that is, I guess, really important.  Who?  Let's see.  Hmm.  Hey, Kevin Spacey was up here?  Yeah, yesterday.  Really?  How was he?  How was he?  Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards.  Oh, what time did he come up?  It was, uh, probably like 11, 1130.  What was he plugging?  I don't know. 
[04:28:00]  House of Cards, maybe, but he was not.  I don't know.  House of Cards.  What did Bob Edwards?  The interview was plugging?  Whatever it was.  It wasn't on his show.  No, it certainly wasn't.  Why wouldn't he do our show?  I've been a champion of his.  Maybe he doesn't want to ask certain questions.  Champlain.  I've been a champlain of his.  Certain questions.  Oh, just answer the question.  I don't know.  I'm not going to ask anything about that.  If there's certain things, he's probably afraid he'll be brought up.  Oh, what?  Like what?  I have no idea.  Why is anybody?  You're being very vague, Jerry.  Like what?  I honestly don't know.  I'm just saying that. 
[04:28:30]  Maybe there's things that he worries about.  Why is that?  That's not even a question.  There are certain pantomimes.  I'm getting this sharp pain in my head.  Is that bad?  I keep worrying about a stroke.  I keep getting this sharp pain in my brain.  It's just a headache, right?  It's just your head.  It's blowing ice.  Oh, wait.  Maybe it's Edgar.  Left side?  Yeah.  You cut down your coffee, right?  A little bit. 
[04:29:00]  Might be that.  Maybe.  Headaches are brutal when you're trying to get off caffeine.  Rolling.  Hello, Rylan.  Kevin Spacey and Poe.  He was throwing his Tribeca indie film.  Why did he come on to this show?  We didn't promote it.  He only did Bob Edwards.  That's it.  Bob Edwards.  So he wanted to talk to 12 people.  Who the fuck listens to Bob Edwards at this point?  He probably does.  He's probably a Bob Edwards fan.  Yeah, but he also liked Otto.  Yeah.  And we like Otto.  It could have been an interview.  And House of Cards.  I fucking talking the shit out of that. 
[04:29:30]  I know.  And he did his Ventriloquist short film, which I finally saw.  I don't know.  Did you see that thing?  Yeah.  What did you think?  What was it about?  I don't know.  I don't know what it was about.  What's it about?  What's it about?  You know what it is?  He probably likes a show like Bob Edwards because Bob Edwards will just not talk about  anything he doesn't want to talk about.  All right.  You've got it. 
[04:30:00]  Oh, that's fucking great.  Sometimes we've got to do radio for ourselves.  I apologize.  Yeah.  I apologize.  Oh, my God.  Did you like the Ventriloquist movie?  I didn't really get it.  I didn't get it either.  Thank God it wasn't just me.  I was just like, oh, what?  Well, there's one guy talking.  The other guy's not real.  Oh, see, I thought.  Was it that his life would be better without the dummy and he finally realized that?  It was a security blanket.  It was holding him back.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  It was filmed nicely. 
[04:30:30]  Yes.  It looked good.  It started off good.  And then it just turned into something I didn't get.  I thought so.  I don't get things.  And Russell T. Pitch with Debbie Allen.  That's the person.  Debbie Allen?  Yeah.  From the dancers.  Who's Miss Debbie Allen?  We were just talking about that.  What do you mean?  As right before you asked?  Yeah, who is she?  Which one's Karen Allen?  Karen Allen's white.  Karen Allen's the one from Indiana Jones. 
[04:31:00]  Nice.  Damn, did you photobomb that?  You ass.  That was Debbie Allen out there?  Yeah.  Yeah, I photobombed.  Do I get a look at my fucking face?  That's a good one.  Wow, you fucking nailed it.  You fucking ruined their picture.  And she posted it?  If you go to Miss Debbie Allen, she writes, look who I ran into this morning.  And then in the background, you see my fucking shit.  That's hilarious.  Which one was the one from RoboCop? 
[04:31:30]  Which Allen?  Probably Nancy Allen.  Was she white?  Nancy Allen.  She was in Blowout, I think, with John Travolta.  And she was a hot one.  And then Karen Allen was the one from Indiana Jones, from the Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Debbie Allen was in the movie Fame.  Debbie Allen was in Fame, and that's the one Russell.  You see Fame when Leroy's dancing, and one of the girls says, what do you call that?  And she goes, wicked.  You don't remember her?  I remember her.  That's the woman she was.  Yeah, that I remember.  I just wrote, sorry.  I always get the Allens confused.  I just wrote, sorry for the photo bar. 
[04:32:00]  Yeah, which one is Wrench?  Caroline's, tomorrow through Sunday.  Jokes like that will be a fly-in.  That was a good one.  When did you start up tomorrow already?  Yeah.  Week is cooking.  Because we missed Monday.  Wow, I want to go to a lot of the shows.  What's the one show tomorrow?  One tomorrow, one Sunday.  I'm guessing eight.  Yeah, I could do eight.  Especially with these new hours.  Because I'm able to stay out a little longer.  It's nice.  Hi, Debbie.  Is it 7.30 tomorrow? 
[04:32:30]  Oh, 7.30 show tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  I want to be a half hour late.  My apologies.  I'm going to try to go to the 7.30 show tomorrow.  I haven't seen you in a while, Jimmy.  It'll be great.  Oh, 7.30 and 10 Friday, Saturday.  Oh, even better.  Yeah, man, please, come.  I would love you guys to come.  Okay.  And this funny thing, I'm doing Caroline's.  I go right up and I go, hey, imagine if this place was called Sweet Caroline's.  We'd all be singing.  It's not my arms out.  Your arms are out in a hat gesture. 
[04:33:00]  All right, guys.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, my giant camel toe video is doing very, very well.  Yeah, that was funny.  I talked about it on the pre-show and I sent it to Jimmy because I know he likes big giant camel toes.  Yes.  I'll retweet it on my Twitter, OP Radio, if you haven't seen it yet.  But it's doing very well.  The Stupid News just filmed this lady's camel toe because she didn't want her face on the news.  And it's hilarious.  I think it's hilarious.  So I'll retweet that now.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.

[04:38:00]  Unfortunately, the O.P. and Anthony show is over.  Fortunately, we have a hard time letting go.  The stories behind the stories behind the stories.  The backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting. 
[04:38:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show with Sam Roberts.  Let's look back together, shall we?  Welcome to the Post Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969 is the phone number if you want to call.  I am Sam Roberts here to reflect with you on what was another great day of radio.  Russell Simmons was terrific.  Really, uh, got our asses kicked by Humble and Fred from Canada. 
[04:39:00]  Is Humble a name in Canada?  Like, are people named Humble?  I would love to know.  And, I was really getting into the old school ant stories.  The ant as a tin knocker stories.  It was, uh, real stories of rags to riches, that guy, huh?  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969 if you'd like to be a part of today's O.P. and Anthony Post Show. 
[04:39:30]  Let's get Roland in here today.  It's been too long.  I know he's afraid of, uh, Redditors.  But, uh, let's get, let's get Roland on the show today.  Uh, but before we do that, yeah, go find Roland and tell him to come in.  I just want to talk to him.  I want to talk to Roland about meditating.  Because Russell Simmons inspired me.  I'm sure I'm not going to do it.  That's just what happens when we have guests in.  It's just whatever they say, if they sound convincing, you just go home thinking you're  going to do it.  But I want to talk to Roland about that. 
[04:40:00]  So, hopefully we'll hear from him in a little bit.  But first, let's find out what today's line of the day was.  You know, I woke up one day at a time, you know?  And it was really an experience, you know?  It was an experience.  It taught me a lot about myself, being able to do that.  And, um, that's 25 years ago now. 
[04:40:30]  Wow.  26, damn, I'm old as fuck.  I've been sober longer than my girl that date had been alive.  And I was high longer than they were alive, too.  Russell Simmons, I mean, he, he's, he's hope, I feel like.  Because you think that once you're a hundred millionaire, that you can't be honest anymore.  And that you can't come in and hang out, and you can't, like, he didn't have a giant entourage with him. 
[04:41:00]  He was just being honest.  He was giving his opinions.  That's exactly what you want out of a guest.  Especially when they have tons of money.  And he wasn't even ashamed of his money.  When he was talking about his own experiences, he was freely talking about the fact that he has a greeter that meets him at the airport.  He was all on board with the Samsung white glove thing that Roland's hooked up Opie and Anthony with.  He knows.  He's in the upper echelon.  Eric in Iowa, welcome to the Post Show.  Hey guys, great show today.  Thanks.  Yeah, Russell Simmons seems like a pretty, pretty decent guy. 
[04:41:30]  Good representative for the black community.  Well.  You guys were talking about the holes in the shows.  What you guys need is a 500 pound vegan to laugh at every word that comes out of your mouth.  Maybe that's what it is.  If you guys had that, then you guys would be successful.  I guess, but I don't know where we're going to find it.  I don't know where we're going to find it.  Let's go to, uh, let's go to Dan in PA.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, what's up, Primetime Sam Roberts?  Not too much.  All right.  Um, during, when they were talking about the stewardess video again? 
[04:42:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  First thing this morning.  Yeah.  Jimmy, Jimmy said, um, one of the reasons he didn't like it is because there was so many,  so many much more mean or more funny things that, that she could have said.  Yeah.  Oh, I think you should, you know, plan a little contest with the producer there and have him  write up a little, uh, flight attendant bit to see if he can best her, her skills.  Oof.  I mean, I don't even think Jim would have to write that thing.  I think just off the top of his head, the brutality that he could come up to tell a cabin 
[04:42:30]  full of, uh, uh, uh, captive audience members.  Uh, I don't think there's any doubt that he can pull that off.  Thanks, Dan.  Let's go to Lou in Jersey.  What's up, Lou?  Hey, how you doing, Sammy?  Good.  I want to comment on, uh, Governor Christie's, uh, marijuana stance.  Yes.  Yeah, well, Governor Christie, we played the clip, uh, early on during the first hour of  today's show, and Chris Christie said that as long as he's governor of New Jersey, he 
[04:43:00]  will not allow the legalization of marijuana.  And he's citing some, like, you know, doctor references that, uh, he says it's still very,  very dangerous.  Well, there's a lot of things that are dangerous in New Jersey that, uh, he doesn't like to  comment on.  I believe that the, the heroin problem that we have here in the state is ridiculous.  Uh, he's changed his stance on multiple things.  There's probably a lot of, a lot of traffic patterns that can be very dangerous in New Jersey.  Absolutely. 
[04:43:30]  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying, Roland?  Roland, I'm glad you're in here.  I wanted to talk to you.  Were you listening to the Russell Simmons interview?  No.  What do you mean, no?  No.  Why not?  I was doing things.  What things?  Wrapping up things before.  Guess.  You just said words.  Things.  Eric, did I miss something in that sentence?  No, he's actually pretty accurate on what he was doing.  Things, guess things?  Guess things.  Okay, I mean, I, I, look. 
[04:44:00]  I don't know if he wants to say who the guess things were.  Okay, you were doing guess things.  Okay, I accept it.  I heard some of it, though.  My question to you, you lived a very, you live a very stressful life.  Yeah.  A lot of the audience doesn't help you at this point.  Oh, no, no, no.  In your, in your tenure here at the Opie and Anthony show.  We all go through our ups and downs, though.  You know that.  Uh, what do you think of, uh, of, of allowing some meditation in your life?  I, I'm probably in the same school as Eric, where I won't be able to shut down.  What do you mean you wouldn't be able to shut down?  I walk by, Eric shut down half the show. 
[04:44:30]  He's only shut down.  No, but I can, if you're quiet, and then you start meditating, you go, oh yeah, I have to do this.  No, there's no way you can, don't tell me you can't shut down.  I see you, you're asleep half the time.  But still, I'm still thinking why I'm asleep.  You and Eric are two of the easiest people that I know to shut down.  See, but you think that, but.  I've seen you shut down.  For no reason.  You're in the middle of a meeting and you're shut down.  Well, that's because that's boring.  Sal, do you think Roland and Eric.  My body protects me in boredom.  Do you think Roland and Eric really have a tough time shutting down?  Uh, I'd say more, more Roland than Eric. 
[04:45:00]  He has sleep.  We're in the middle of a meeting and he's unconscious.  There's no more.  You can't be more shut down than being asleep.  Because I got other thoughts besides this nonsense I'm being shoveled into.  Huh?  The shoveling of, here's this, here's that.  Yeah, but you're asleep.  Like, it's not like.  I still hear shit, though.  You do not.  I do.  I've seen you get surprised when we make a loud noise.  I know.  What was that?  Because I was in meditative.  I think you're both afraid to try.  Because I don't think either of you would have a tough time shutting down. 
[04:45:30]  Why don't you do it, Chachi?  I would do it.  Do it then.  I just said before you came.  You're doing DTP.  DTP, throw this in your mix.  DTP.  Whatever that's called.  What's it called?  DTP.  Eric, you think you have too hard of a time shutting down to do yoga?  It's 20 minutes.  No, not the yoga.  I thought you were talking more about the meditation.  Oh, well, I mean, I guess the meditation.  I've tried many times to do the meditation.  Yeah.  You can tune out things around you, but Roland is right. 
[04:46:00]  It's hard to shut down yourself to do that.  I've tried.  I don't know.  I've seen you doze off on those phones.  That's tuning out.  That's not shutting down.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So, all right.  See, now we're getting somewhere.  If you try to do it, you can't stop your brain or your mind from constantly going.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  The whole point of meditation is that you have to do it constantly to get to that point where  you can actually do it.  It's like exercise.  You can't just give up after a dozen tries, you know?  So, it's like you can tune out easily.  I can tune out. 
[04:46:30]  You can easily lose focus.  Sure.  Yes.  But shutting off is not as easy.  No.  That's why I have to sleep with the TV on.  I can't.  So, when you tune out, and when you lose focus, what is it that's going on in your head?  Are you thinking of, like, ideas for your movie?  Are you thinking of previous Doctor Who episodes?  No.  It's anything else that I have going on.  Like what?  Either that day.  All right.  Like, what's one thing you lost focus on because of today? 
[04:47:00]  I didn't lose focus on anything today.  You were focused 100.  On everything I was doing today, yeah.  I was thinking, should I take a shit now or let it brew?  And it's thoughts like that that would creep into your meditation time.  And then I giggle, and then I'm like, what was I doing?  Why don't you try this?  I think I know the problem with you meditating, Roland.  I don't think you'd be able to understand your mantra.  You have to be able to repeat the mantra.  And if you don't know what you're saying...  I have a mantra.  What is it?  I'll fuck you up.  Yeah, yeah.  Capiche?  Can you imagine? 
[04:47:30]  It's not very zen.  No.  No.  It's the least zen mantra.  I'm going to fuck him up.  I'm going to fuck him up.  I'm going to...  I don't know if it would work.  Your mantra shouldn't have an action in it.  Right.  Right.  Right.  No, that just sounds like...  That sounds less like meditating and more like brooding, actually.  Well, they should make their rules clear, then.  Have you ever meditated, Sal?  Uh, no.  No.  But it does seem like, you know, everyone should, like, exercise their mind to some degree.  I think Roland would benefit probably the most out of any of us.  You've got to have your inner peace, dude.  I do. 
[04:48:00]  No, you don't.  You're the least peaceful person I know.  I feel it's turning now, insanity later.  Right.  Yeah.  No, it's insanity now, I kind of feel like, a lot of times.  Yeah.  Well, it pushes you here.  That's why you've got to find your inner peace.  You've got to get in.  My inner peace is dead.  It died.  It's dead now.  Oh, he's long gone.  He took a vacation, gave me the finger.  And that's it.  That's it.  So you're saying if you meditated, you'd look inside yourself and realize there's nothing  there anymore.  No.  That's sad.  That's sad, Roland.  Shit happens.  What about you, Eric?  You've got to find your...  Well, I have my inner peace. 
[04:48:30]  Okay.  It's just not here.  But it is when I leave here.  You've got to carry it with you everywhere.  It's easier said than done sometimes.  That's what Russell Simmons told us today, though.  Yeah.  That's why you've got to do it before you go to work.  You've got to meditate for 20 minutes.  Right?  Yeah.  You're not going to, are you?  I'll fall asleep.  That's your problem.  No, it's too early in the morning for that, but...  All right, I'm going to get up and meditate.  Eric, are you sleeping?  Eric, wake up!  Well, what happens if you sleep, though?  You're so into Zellen.  I think you're allowed to sleep when you meditate. 
[04:49:00]  I'm in.  I mean, like, you could meditate on the shitter, I'll bet.  Why don't you try that?  Next time you drop a hot deuce...  I fall asleep before I'm a shitter.  I fell asleep.  You have fallen...  Yeah, that's what I mean.  The movies, they bang down the door, like, are you okay?  Like, yeah.  Like, this whole idea of, like, oh, I just...  I can't turn my brain off.  It's too active.  Anybody who falls asleep while taking a shit does not suffer from that problem.  Eh, you have things on my mind.  No, you don't.  What you've got to do, though, is find your spot.  Maybe the shitter is your spot. 
[04:49:30]  I just want you to find peace.  And maybe...  He doesn't have it.  It's there.  I don't know.  Everybody has it.  He can't sit still for a while.  Like, he'll be working.  But when he's not working, he kind of, like, panics.  So he's got to get up and walk around.  And keep walking around.  And then he'll come back and sit down, do something, and then he's got to get up and walk around again.  Later, peace.  He can't calm down.  Roland, uh, Lady Trucker has a mantra for you.  Good morning, gentlemen. 
[04:50:00]  Wait, is Lady...  How are you with Lady Trucker, Roland?  All right.  We're going to make the...  We're going to figure it out right now?  Yeah.  Okay.  What's up?  What's the mantra, Lady Trucker?  Okay, Roland's mantra is...  Okay, that's, I mean...  Unfortunately, it wasn't mean.  No.  But it wasn't funny.  No.  So it's just kind of...  Like a turd.  Yeah, it's like a turd.  Back to the turds.  Maybe turds are controlling your life.  Maybe you need to say, okay, I'm not going to sit on the toilet and take a nice seven-minute dump. 
[04:50:30]  I'm going to sit on the toilet.  Come on, go.  I'm going to sit on the toilet for 20 minutes.  Ooh.  And you pull your pants down to your ankles.  But then you get jello legs, which is the worst.  There you go.  When you get up, your legs are all tingly.  Sal, can you put this on Roland's iPod for him?  Definitely.  Okay.  I'll be asleep in two minutes.  Okay.  Well, so be it.  We're just here snoring.  Is that your mantra?  Roland, you got to put this on in your iPod.  Sit down in that stall.  Put your pants and underwear down, of course.  Let the cheeks spread. 
[04:51:00]  And then figure out a mantra.  Like maybe like...  I don't know.  What kind of mantra do you think you would have?  Say yes to yes.  No.  It's not work-related.  Oh.  What brings you peace?  What brings you joy?  Like, oh, ham and Swiss on rye.  My cronuts.  Right.  I love you, Dominique.  That could be your mantra.  You say, I love you, Dominique.  Right.  Yeah.  And you just kind of repeat that to yourself.  You have this going in the headphones. 
[04:51:30]  And you know, set an alarm on your watch or whatever, or your phone.  And you're there for 20 minutes.  And you're listening to this.  And if shit comes out of you, shit comes out of you.  That's even more peaceful.  Yeah.  And you just kind of exist on the shitter for 20 minutes.  Would you try something like that?  Yeah.  It could be great.  I would try it.  It could be great.  You feel more peaceful?  I do.  Do you feel like you have to take shit a little bit?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Okay, good.  So we're halfway there.  But I will soon. 
[04:52:00]  Good.  And one more coffee I'm in.  Maybe have a nice coffee, a nice bacon, egg, and cheese.  Then head in there.  And lock yourself in for 20 minutes.  I think that's what it's about.  Have your quiet time.  I think I'm going to go upstairs because they have an air conditioner going to the bathroom.  Sal, is this not a great idea?  Crow nut.  Crow nut.  Something like that.  Just do that.  Something like that.  Yeah.  An out-of-body experience.  You know where you could meditate?  You could put a permanent Christmas tree up in your man cave.  Yeah.  And you could just kind of burrow under the tree. 
[04:52:30]  Like a little, like, you know, you're sleeping on Christmas morning like you do.  And just kind of lay down under the tree.  And then shut your eyes and just kind of, I don't know, like, what's...  I used to lay under the tree.  Sam is calling us both retarded and look up the tree.  Like, like, snacks and pocket money.  Snacks and pocket money.  No.  I don't need that.  You got plenty?  I'm good.  So what would your mantra be?  I don't know.  Like, what's your passion?  Your account balance is. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah.  He's doing fine.  Like, what's your passion?  Like, souvenirs and goodies?  Or, uh, cruise.  I just sit there and like, the Simpsons.  No, I know what it would be.  Sal, it would be Coke floats.  I've never had those.  BLT.  Don't yell.  BLT.  Coke floats and bacon.  And it sounds good, too.  Coke floats and bacon.  Ooh, that sounds good.  Coke floats and bacon.  And then you just lay under your Christmas tree that you build just for your meditation zone.  And if your wife goes, why do you have a Christmas tree?  You're an adult. 
[04:53:30]  You go, that's where I meditate.  That's my zen tree.  I'd have that tree up all year.  I know, and you put ornaments and stuff on it, but you call it the zen tree.  Don't call it a Christmas tree.  I saw my tree.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  Yeah.  And you can put even, you can put a toy Harry Potter train that goes between you and the  tree.  So, like, you lay under the tree and the Harry Potter train goes around you the whole time,  quietly.  Because we're zen.  Right.  Helps you relax.  Right.  And you could even say Hogwarts, Coke floats and bacon.  And Tardis. 
[04:54:00]  Right.  Relaxicus.  Right.  All right.  So, are we in a better place now?  I'm fine.  The intern's almost asleep, so he's there.  He's there with all of us.  Roland, you feeling good?  I feel really good.  So, you're going to do your 20 minutes of meditation on the toilet.  E-Rock, you'll be under the Christmas tree.  That's correct.  All right.  Great.  Great.  Sal, have we gotten to a good place?  I think we're getting somewhere, man.  All right.  And Sal, you can do it in a bathhouse.  Every, the peaceful area for everybody.  And, yeah.
