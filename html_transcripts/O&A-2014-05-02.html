<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning rapidly between them.  The show opened with Opie detailing his severe allergies and the difficulties he faced obtaining medication due to insurance and Obamacare issues.  He humorously recounted his use of expired nasal sprays and discussed the alleged side effects of Propecia, including a joke about racism.  A caller, Nick, inquired about Opie's bathing habits, leading to a discussion of Ricky Gervais's tweets about baths. This segued into a major segment focusing on the perceived overabundance of public apologies, referencing  Jeremy Clarkson's apology for a potentially racist nursery rhyme (a video clip was played), a gaming company firing a community manager, and a newspaper apologizing for calling Kevin Durant "Mr. Unreliable." The hosts, along with callers, expressed disbelief at the prevalence of what they considered unnecessary apologies, initiating a failed challenge to go 10 days without hearing of one. The discussion also touched upon the New York Post's reaction to Donald Sterling's cancer diagnosis and an NAACP president's resignation.

The show then moved to a comedic bit parodying Reverend Al Sharpton's reaction to the N-word being used on Wheel of Fortune, featuring a humorous, exaggerated apology.  Upcoming guests Tammy Pescatelli and Jim Florentine were announced, with Florentine's role in *Californication* mentioned. The conversation drifted to the effects of allergy medication, cheerleaders' uniform modesty, and a further discussion of Jeremy Clarkson's apology and *Top Gear*.  This transitioned into a discussion of Adam Ferrara's role in *Nurse Jackie*, followed by a highly amusing video of Reverend Al Sharpton seemingly choking during an interview. The hosts then discussed a "hookup truck" in San Francisco, a mobile sex suite, prompting a discussion about sanitation and San Francisco's bathhouse history during the AIDS epidemic and the movie *And the Band Played On*.  Further discussion of the hookup truck, self-cleaning public toilets in San Francisco, and a "Mile High Club" plane service in Vegas followed, along with a clip of Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford discussing Willard Scott's marriage and a subsequent discussion on heaven and the afterlife.  A listener called about the Vegas Mile High Club service, followed by a brief, interrupted call about a car accident. This led to a discussion of a woman suing the family of a child she killed in a car accident, and Opie's hatred of roadside bicycle accident memorials.

A significant portion of the show contained highly sexually explicit and offensive content. The hosts and an unidentified third host engaged in conversations about the death of an unnamed individual shortly after allegations (referenced the Joe Paterno case),  the use of racial slurs during sex, numerous explicit personal sexual experiences (including details of threesomes and faking orgasms), and a jokingly imitated "Weird News" segment about a squirrel attacking someone taking a selfie and a woman with many cats. Callers Chris (Connecticut) and Ryan (Red Bank) participated in this segment.  Reverend Al Sharpton, Ozzy Osbourne, and *Seinfeld* actors were referenced.

The show continued with a discussion of the *Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park* movie, focusing on Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Jim Florentine then recounted backstage experiences at a Ratt concert, including Steven Pearcy’s behavior and a friend flashing her breasts for access. This expanded to a discussion of backstage passes and implied sexual favors.  Florentine recounted being denied backstage access to the Scorpions despite a girl flashing the band.  A news story about a 71-year-old NYC Transit employee suing his boss for sexual harassment was discussed, along with the Donald Sterling scandal. A call from Dallas was lost, and a caller who created a fake Roland Twitter account to book comedian Mike Baker was mentioned. Another caller, Daniel, corrected Jimmy’s comments about NBA players' legal obligations regarding the Donald Sterling controversy.  A South African listener, Andre, called to discuss South African culture and the Oscar Pistorius trial. The segment ended with a birthday celebration for Kenny, featuring Denny Falcone’s awkward birthday song.

The final segment focused heavily on Kenny's birthday, including discussions of cupcakes, a police chief's cupcake preferences, and a humorous comparison of male buttocks to cupcakes.  Mike Baker's appearance on Fox News and past experiences were mentioned.  Numerous read advertisements for ProFlowers and Sherry's Berries were aired.  Guests Florentine, Pescatelli, and Jim were present.  Florentine mentioned upcoming appearances, Pescatelli promoted her shows, and numerous text messages, including humorous ones from "007" and the White House, were read.  Kenny's birthday gifts were discussed, along with ribbing about his jeans and BlackBerry phone.  The show concluded with final birthday wishes for Kenny and thank yous to listeners.  The show also included a video about MSNBC and their perceived lack of discussion regarding racism, and further discussion of Jim Florentine’s experience on *Californication* and the Donald Sterling controversy, ending with thoughts on the changing social landscape, freedom of speech, and ease of recording conversations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, oh, oh, I see. Good morning, everybody.  Friday! Friday!  Ah, thank God it's...  That's what I say.  Thank God it's what?  Uh, Friday.  Ah, that was it. That's what they say, right?  That's a nice slogan, I'm thinking.  Oh, uh, T-shirt.  T-shirt, ah, you know.  Thank God it's Friday.  That's not good enough for a T-shirt.  You could even, thank you, sir.  You could even shorten it to just T-G-I-F, I think it is. 
[00:00:30]  No, not good enough for a T-shirt, I'm sorry.  Ah, that's true.  I'm sorry, sir.  We're very picky with our T-shirt designs.  It happens.  What?  Shit.  Yeah, that stupid face that got dabbed on him.  That's so stupid.  Yeah, it didn't even make sense.  No.  Have a nice day.  Have a nice day, I'm retarded.  Just having to look up on every major pop culture expression.  Yes, of course.  It's hard.  It's hard that everything, we get it. 
[00:01:00]  Exactly.  Say hi to Nick in Niagara Falls.  He has a very good question.  Nick, go ahead.  Slowly I turn.  Yeah.  Nick, hey.  Uh, Opie, I just want to know how your bath looked yesterday, bud.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you for, uh, thinking about me.  Oh, it's the old soak.  I actually did take a soak yesterday.  You did.  And let's not forget, Ricky Gervais also takes baths.  Yes, he does.  And he tweets from the bathtub, so I'm not alone.  I'm in good company.  Tweet some, uh, bizarre pictures of himself looking like a frog.  Yeah, froggy face. 
[00:01:30]  That's funny.  It's actually very funny.  And I also want to thank all the people that, uh, sent me stuff for my, uh, my baths.  Oh.  They did?  Little trays where you can put your books.  You can't.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people went on the Bed, Bath & Beyond website yesterday.  Oh, I like the Beyond.  Nice little bath salts and, you know, all sorts of things.  Did you smoke them?  Soaps, candles.  Bath salts?  Do you eat anyone's face?  No, no.  That's good shit.  No, I, uh, I had to stay inside yesterday because my immune system is trying to kill me. 
[00:02:00]  Is that it?  Like the AIDS?  What a beautiful day yesterday.  It was.  I had to stay in because I'm very allergic this time of year.  You got an allergic?  I'm very allergic for like a week, maybe two weeks.  And then it goes away, which is so strange.  And then I'm good until the fall.  So I, I, I couldn't go outside yesterday.  Oh.  It was what?  75?  It was nice.  75 degrees.  Really nice.  Not a cloud in the sky.  It was gorgeous. 
[00:02:30]  But, uh, that stupid pollen is in full effect.  Yeah.  And, uh, I'm fucking hurting.  Day two of hurting from the, uh, the pollen.  The itchy schnozola?  Oh, God, yeah.  And then, uh, Dr. Steve was trying to get me on some kind of new medication for this.  But, you know, with Obama.  See, it's an AIDS joke.  That's hilarious.  It's AIDS again.  Oh, God.  Six, twenty, fucking years of AIDS jokes.  It actually took longer than I thought it would.  Of course.  Dr. Steve's a lifesaver, as they say. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, not in his own profession.  He's Dr. Death.  Absolutely.  He really is.  But, fucking, with Obamacare and, and COA, it's, it's, it's just a pain in the ass to  try to get anything done.  Used to be able to just go in and.  He goes, I called in a prescription that's way better than taking Claritin D and nasal  sprays and, and Singulair.  And, uh, and then the CBS calls me and we need to pre-approve this and we need this and that.  And then Steve's like, well, go on the website because you could get like the, you could fill 
[00:03:30]  out this co-pay slip.  What website?  The co-pay for the drug, I guess.  Cause the, the co-pay on the drug is like ridiculously expensive.  Holy shit.  And I'm in my house.  I don't even want to leave my house cause it makes it way worse.  Listen, in the end, I just didn't go because it was just too much of a fucking problem.  So I'm still on the Claritin D.  Oh shit.  They make it so fucking hard to get prescriptions, uh, done.  But as long as everyone's covered.  Oh God. 
[00:04:00]  And then, you know, maybe I should have just paid out of pocket the whole fucking thing.  You know what?  That's usually the best way for, uh, whenever you got a problem.  But it's hundreds of dollars for one little spray thing.  Eh, sometimes you gotta suck it up.  I know.  It's the principle though.  You know what I mean?  They don't cover my Propecia.  They don't give a shit about my hair.  You're still doing Propecia.  Well, you gotta do that for the rest of your life.  As soon as you, that's a dumb drug.  What's that?  A drug, supposedly it works, but as soon as you stop it, it just like takes it.  Then it just, your hair will fall out.  Everything you did goes away. 
[00:04:30]  Here's the thing.  I don't know if I even need it.  Like I had the follicles put in.  Right.  And then I started taking the Propecia.  Right.  So I don't know if I was gonna have shit fall out anymore.  Well, I wasn't bald.  It was thinning.  Right.  But you know where the line is.  Yeah.  Like I know where my issues are.  Right.  And you know the exact line where the rest of it is cool.  Right.  You know that.  The rest of it's cool.  No.  Yeah.  I see the exact line where, all right, in between this line and that line, I might need a little  help. 
[00:05:00]  That's an issue.  But I know I'm not gonna go like, uh, shoehorn bald or any of that shit.  Yeah.  But with the Propecia, like I don't know if I need it, but I'm gonna take that chance.  Right.  I'm gonna stop taking it and all of a sudden my fucking hair falls out.  Right.  And they don't pay for that.  They don't pay for the Propecia.  That's like a cosmetic thing.  Right.  So you gotta go out of pocket.  And I think it's, um, I think it's 75 bucks for that prescription.  For what?  How long was that last year?  A month.  Oh.  What are the side effects of Propecia?  Uh, you become a flaming racist. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, wow.  Uh, and, uh, see, please help me here.  I'm on medication.  Don't get so angry with me.  Can't believe you're sprinkling Propecia on your cereal since you were a boy.  My whole family apparently takes it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the whole family's in on that stuff?  Uh, no, I'm saying for being racist.  Ah.  Uh, no, I guess the side effects are supposed to be some kind of, uh, uh, uh, they say sexual  side effects, but I, you're not supposed to get a rod, or?  I haven't had that.  No, not so much that, but, uh, your libido supposedly goes down. 
[00:06:00]  But I could attest to the fact that that does not fucking happen.  Or it might have been, it might be way worse.  Maybe I would be like a fucking rapist.  You might be walking, you're supposed to be walking around with a boner all the time.  With a rod all the time, maybe.  It's called Dymista.  D-Y-M-I-S-T-A.  I'm telling the people, maybe they could use, uh, some help with their allergies.  I said that to someone once.  D-Y-M-I-S-T-A.  D-Y-M-I-S-T-A.  D-Y-M-I-S-T-A. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Fucking got you.  Bless you.  Got you.  Can I get some of this shit on the black market?  Oh, hey, racist.  Come on.  Little envelope with some Dymista in there?  Not in this fucking day and age.  Can you leave it at the front door here, please?  Yeah.  Ah.  Fuck.  It's so frustrating.  These fucking...  You got your visine in front of you.  Well, I got the, uh, eye allergy relief visine.  What's in the blue thing there? 
[00:07:00]  I got...  They needed the money!  I got some...  It looks like an ass butt plug.  Pat...  Pat...  Pat...  Patanase or something like that.  Pat-tay?  Patanase, but let's see the, uh...  D-Rock likes Patanase.  See, because it's like mayonnaise.  Oh.  Yes, except General Patton likes it.  Oh.  Boo.  This shit's two years old.  Past the...  Whoa.  Oh, yay!  Past the expiration date.  That's, uh, two years old.  Jesus.  And then, uh, some Afrin. 
[00:07:30]  And then I took a Claritin day.  Wow.  You might be over-medicating.  No, I'm being very...  I'm being very careful.  Are you?  Yeah, because...  You get hooked on that, won't you?  Uh, after four or five days.  Afrin's fucking great.  Dude, by gay...  By day two, I'm fucking...  By gay?  Oh, Jesus.  By gay?  Yes, there was two of the three options.  Straight to the other one.  The, uh...  By day two, though, Afrin fucking ruins me.  Like, I...  By day two?  My nose re-swells.  Right.  And I gotta take the Afrin again.  Everyone is so quick to say how addictive it is, and, hey, you gotta be careful. 
[00:08:00]  It's like, when I have a cold, I'll use that shit the whole time I have a cold.  And it's great.  Right.  It clears your fucking nose out.  And then you just stop doing it.  Right.  Like, I haven't...  I haven't wanted to, like, shove it up my fucking nose.  No, but don't you have a day or two where your nose is really bad after it?  Like, really stuffy?  No.  Not really.  No, it works so fucking well.  I've only done two sprays of that shit.  That's like when I, you know...  But with allergies, it fucking takes your whole body down.  It's not about just sneezing.  Really?  With watery eyes.  Your whole body feels just...  Allergies just, like, clog my nose, and you get the itchy eyes. 
[00:08:30]  That's about it.  Whoa.  Hold on a minute.  Oh!  Uh, DJ.  How you doing, boys?  My wife works next door to you guys over at News Corp.  She actually knows Roland, Anthony, and Jimmy.  And I get my admission all the time.  She can bring it over if you want it.  She knows us?  Yeah, she can't actually follow us.  Well, that would be...  I haven't texted her anything inappropriate, have I?  Well...  No dick pics?  Is your wife's name Shauna Hannity? 
[00:09:00]  Well, sir, that would be highly, highly illegal.  But hold on the line.  I want to give you a t-shirt.  We want to reprimand you.  I want to give you a t-shirt for, you know, for thinking of me.  Yes, of course.  But that would be highly illegal to take someone else's prescriptions.  All right, well, it is better than yesterday, which is good.  But being like a fucking little wimpy fucking man where you can't even go outside. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Because you know it's going to get way worse.  But anyway, enough of that.  Yeah, it's a shame.  We got a lot of apologies.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Ones that don't even need to be said.  We started something a mere few days ago.  We're trying to see if we could go 10 days without an apology.  And we thought that was going to be too short a period of time.  Right, right.  Like a week.  We were like, we should go a week.  Right.  See if people go a week without apologizing.  So we're like, ah, that might be too short.  Let's go 10 days.  Let's go 10 days.  A week is too long. 
[00:10:00]  This is already, we're breaking it for the second time already since starting this.  Crazy.  And I think we started this Tuesday.  Yeah.  I think it's completely ridiculous, the world we live in now.  With the finger pointing.  You did something wrong.  Wagging the finger.  This guy from England.  But which one do you want to start with?  Well, that's the one that really has me boggled.  Jeremy Clarkson?  Yeah.  The guy from Top Gear England.  Right. 
[00:10:30]  Holy fuck.  He apologized for something no one complained about.  Right.  It never even made it to the air.  He used the N-word, huh?  No.  No.  That's just it, too.  But the headline, okay, I used the N-word.  But he said that, but he didn't.  TV host says.  His whole thing, is it on here, his explanation?  Because, is this the slope line that he did with it?  No.  He just said that the guy's on a slope and it was an Asian guy?  Nope.  Is it the same guy, though?  I don't know. 
[00:11:00]  I know this guy apologized for saying, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch.  Oh, thanks.  And apparently, he mumbled it.  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a mm by the toe.  Right.  And then the third take, he did three takes of this.  Now, it didn't air.  He was doing something for his show.  And then his third take, he said, eeny, meeny, moe, moe, catch a teacher by the toe. 
[00:11:30]  But he goes, one of his previous takes, which never aired, he mumbled something just to go,  and it was close.  If you turn it up and listen closely, it was close to the N-word.  And he's apologized.  But that's just a childhood rhyme.  But he never even said it.  It is.  We used to do that all the time.  Oh, my God.  How did you pick teams and stuff?  Right.  There was not a, whatever.  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, motherfucker. 
[00:12:00]  Let me see what they say in the article.  It's ludicrous.  Oh, he's begging for forgiveness for racist remarks.  Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has released a video begging, and we got the video here,  people, for public forgiveness after appearing to use the N-word  in a segment for the top-rated television show.  Clarkson claims he tried to obscure the racist word while he recited the nursery rhyme,  eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a, meh, by the toe.  But admitted that, obviously, my efforts weren't quite good enough.  The offending footage was obtained by the Daily Mirror in the UK. 
[00:12:30]  It was recorded on blah, blah, blah.  In the version that did air, Clarkson recited the rhyme but used the word teacher instead.  Clarkson has come under fire in the past for allegedly making racist comment,  this is the world we live in now.  Under fire in the past.  Had earlier issued a robust denial of the allegations that he had used the N-word,  telling his 3.2 million Twitter followers,  I did not use the N-word, never use it.  The mirror has gone way too far this time.  But he then backtracked, posting a video statement online on Thursday, 
[00:13:00]  in which he apologized.  Ordinarily, I don't respond to newspaper allegations,  but on this occasion, I feel I must make an exception, he said.  Wow.  It's so non...  It's a non-issue.  Clarkson said he has been extremely keen to avoid the racist expression  in the best-known version of the rhyme,  and on that day in question, had recorded three takes.  In two, I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur,  and in the third, I replaced it all together with the word teacher, he said. 
[00:13:30]  So like you said, he didn't really say it.  He never said it.  It never aired.  Now, when I viewed this footage several weeks later,  I realized that in one of the mumbled versions,  if you listened very carefully,  with the sound turned way up,  it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure.  I was mortified by this.  Horrified.  No, you weren't.  No, he wasn't.  It's a word I loathe,  and I did everything in my power to make sure that 
[00:14:00]  that version did not appear in the program that was transmitted.  I loathe that word, too.  Oh, wait, I meant love.  Clarkson said he sent a note to the production staff  to ensure that that version of the segment did not go to air,  and it was not broadcast on the BBC.  Please be assured that I did everything in my power to not use the word,  and I'm sitting here begging,  begging your forgiveness for the fact that,  obviously, my efforts weren't quite good enough.  Thank you, Jeremy Clarkson.  Oh, the chest groveling. 
[00:14:30]  Groveling for nothing.  So we had an apology yesterday, right?  So we didn't even make it a day.  Not a day.  We have not made it a day with this whole apology thing.  You have three today.  We do have three.  Three?  Three apologies a day.  Possibly four.  This is hilarious.  I'm thinking of that other one that we talked about before.  Well, because Shaq is still apologizing,  but Andrea Peiser doesn't think it's good enough, by the way.  What would she suggest?  We'll get into her article in a little bit.  And then you got the gaming guy with the tweet, 
[00:15:00]  or whatever.  He works for a game company or something?  That to me is the worst one.  Okay, we got that.  And then we got a newspaper apologizing for a headline they did on Kevin Durant.  What the fuck is going on?  What the fuck?  What are we doing to each other?  And this guy was in England, by the way.  Did they say that?  I thought that was an American word.  I don't know.  Let's see the video that he put out.  There's Jeremy Clarkson.  I don't respond to newspaper allegations,  but on this occasion, I feel I must make an exception. 
[00:15:30]  A couple of years ago, I recorded an item for Top Gear,  in which I quoted the rhyme.  A couple of years ago?  Years ago.  Of course.  A couple of years ago.  I didn't catch that part.  Let me just say, white people, you stink.  White people are the biggest fucking pussies.  You stink, white people.  Ugh, stupid white people.  You're a bunch of fucking pussies.  Yeah, now we're up to the point where,  now you gotta, you know, apologize for things you did many, many years ago. 
[00:16:00]  Years ago.  Now, I may have used the word, how.  I got caught up in that with the whole cake stomp, seven, eight years ago.  You're responsible for stuff you did so long ago now.  Some things are appropriate.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That your feet were actually saying that word while I did that.  Oh, I said shoehorn bald instead of horseshoe bald.  I didn't catch it either.  Are you gonna be okay?  Are you gonna be okay that I...  Shoehorn is the same, that's, uh, like, they should use shoehorn bald. 
[00:16:30]  Why?  That's like a, um, Phil Collins.  Because that little thing of hair is like a shoehorn.  Oh, whatever.  Right?  No?  Maybe?  I'm fucking, I'm fucking just miserable.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I used the wrong words.  All right, back to Jeremy Clarkson.  Yeah.  A couple years ago.  Yeah.  I quoted the rhyme, eenie, meenie, miney, moe.  Ketchen, you go, boy, that's how.  Now, of course, I was well aware that in the best-known version of this rhyme,  there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. 
[00:17:00]  The full rush show that I did three takes.  In two, I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur,  and in the third, I replaced it altogether with the word teacher.  Now, when I viewed this footage several weeks later,  I realised that in one of the mumbled versions,  if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up,  it did appear that I actually used the word I was trying to obscure.  I was mortified by this. 
[00:17:30]  Come on!  He mumbled it.  I'd love to hear it.  I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the program.  Everything in his power.  That was transmitted.  In fact, I have here the note I sent at the time to the production office,  and it says, I didn't use the n-word here,  but I've just listened through my headphones,  and it sounds like I did.  Is there another take that we could use?  Please be assured, I did everything in my power.  Oh, my God!  No one complained! 
[00:18:00]  And he's saying he never used the word.  People are calling for him to be fired, though.  For what, though?  There are mounting calls for him to be...  He's responding to something.  Wow.  Somebody did, uh...  Boy, the whole old money shot shirt call me.  I couldn't be happier.  No.  What the hell did you do?  I wiped a spill on my shirt off with a tissue,  and the lint stuck to it,  and now it's a big cum stain on my fucking shirt.  Because it was orange juice, which is sticky.  I know.  I fucked up.  You're going to have to wet that down.  I fucked up.  Yeah.  You fucked up. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  But you know what?  It's like, this is the guy, though.  Like, people are like,  well, this is the culture we live in, or whatever.  But if somebody else was suffering,  or going through this,  this guy probably wouldn't come out and stick up for me.  Oh, hell no.  He'd be...  He must be fired.  So we all sit around and just watch each other going to the gallows.  Right.  And then when it's us, we're like, what happened?  There, but for the grace of God, go on.  At least we stick up for people.  So fucked up.  Not many people in the media going with this whole angle like we are.  It's crazy.  I'm kind of proud to show that we do this.  Yes. 
[00:19:00]  Because it's really ridiculous, the apologies.  Every day you get one, just about...  We're not going to go ten days without an apology.  Hell no.  Not for a while.  No way in this thing and age.  No way.  But we'll try.  Yeah.  I continue with the Jeremy Clarkson.  Yes.  My power to not use that word.  And that I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness.  For the fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  You fucking piece of shit, white man. 
[00:19:30]  Shut up, whitey.  Why was he using that rhyme anyway?  I guess it was something to do with the show.  I guess he wanted to use it.  Right.  Is there a real version of that, Ryan?  It's eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a tiger by the toe.  Oh, tiger, right.  Okay.  I was trying to remember.  Is that.  But as a kid, everyone said nigger.  It was terrible.  I didn't realize tiger was the actual real version.  I thought tiger was the nicer version.  I think tiger was the nicer version.  I think originally it was always that.  Very offensive. 
[00:20:00]  But that's what people said back in what they called the day.  That's just the way it was.  But the fact that this guy went like, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a by the toe.  That's what he was doing.  He said he was mumbling it.  So catch a by the toe.  And one, I guess, sounded like, and he was like, oh, I'm mortified.  It's terrible.  How did people hear it then if it didn't air?  I guess there were three takes.  Someone must have let it out. 
[00:20:30]  And then somebody in the news was like, oh, did he say that?  Can we see if that's available?  I wish it was.  Let's try to find that out.  It must be.  Let's go to Dave in North Carolina.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I think what he's doing is a preemptive strike.  He got wind that somebody might be able to release this.  Right.  And he's thinking, wait a minute.  I'm not going to be able to ride all these really nice cars.  I'm going to lose this.  Eeny, meeny, miny, miny.  Sorry?  Oh, we found it.  Hold on.  Hold on one second there, David.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[00:21:00]  This video contains offensive language.  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  How's your name on your toe?  Winnie, squeals.  Let's go.  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  How's your name on your toe?  Winnie, squeals.  Let's go.  Oh, Jesus.  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  He's apologizing for that.  He said, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Yes, you might have heard the word if you're deaf and underwater.  Yes. 
[00:21:30]  And the headline is Clarkson's n-word shame.  Wow.  He even admitted that he really wasn't saying the word.  Word shame.  But one might have sounded like he was.  Yikes.  Boy, do we love to just catch each other.  David, anything to add?  No, I just, well, he's horrified or mortified because he's thinking, probably, I just got  this big mortgage.  How the fuck am I going to pay this off?  We know why he's groveling, dude.  No one's questioning why.  Like, we know the call.  He has to.  I think he was goofing on Jim Norton right there.  Oh, I'm sorry, dude.  Were you making a Jim Norton 2002 joke? 
[00:22:00]  I really wish I had been, but I won't.  Oh, okay.  Oh, then you're a piece of shit.  Yeah, I was five, when I was five months into a two-year rent.  Yes.  And I, instead of a $300 and something dollar rent with Florentine and his girlfriend, I  said, I'm in the big time now, guys.  I'm moving into the big old Apple.  And I move in and I pay $2,200 a month.  And five months later, we're off the radio.  Zero job security.  Yeah.  Oops.  Yeah.  But it was only 19 months to go.  You were living like you were rich. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  I was rich.  You were rich.  Now you're a comedy magnate.  Thank you very much.  Magnate.  Yes.  Other comics stick to me.  He's very attractive.  Let's say hi to Dan in Virginia.  Dan, is he the man?  Which one?  No, he's not.  This one is not the man.  No, this is Dan Petto.  Danny.  Yeah, hi.  I'm 36 years old.  Congrats.  Hold on, Dan. 
[00:23:00]  Dan's 36 years young, I'd say.  Good for you, Dan.  All right.  What else?  Good for you.  Thank you very much.  What's he going to say?  Your shoe size?  I wouldn't even know that rhyme is having that word in it.  I grew up, you know, catch a tiger by the toe.  If it wasn't for this...  Poor tiger.  You know, they're endangered and we shouldn't say that either.  Exactly.  It's a paw.  Catching a tiger by...  They don't have toes.  Yeah, I don't think they...  The tiger would appreciate that.  No, they're endangered animals and it's terrible that you would even imply that you could catch 
[00:23:30]  one by the toe.  Sure.  Meaning he's probably captured and very injured.  How about catch a camel by the toe?  That's fine.  There you go.  A camel by the toe.  Catch a camel by the toe.  Oh, if it hollers, you're a moe.  It's the same jokes.  We just package them different every day.  Absolutely.  It's a rhyme and the punchline is somehow we're making each other homosexuals.  Yes, of course. 
[00:24:00]  Let's go to Trucker Bob.  He's going to tell us where the Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe song came from.  Ooh, a little history lesson.  Go ahead, Trucker Bob.  Well, boys, way, way, way back in the day, that's how the plantation owners used to pick  their slaves on the box.  Come on.  All right.  I can't even believe that.  Oh, you're just hilarious.  I watched Roots and I never heard that rhyme the whole time.  You were probably too busy yelling out other things.  Oh, boy. 
[00:24:30]  Wow.  Allentown.  Joe.  How are the jobs?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Iron, coke, chromium, steel.  You guys making a comeback ever since that Billy Joel song or what?  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Nice.  Does someone bring up that song every time you say where you're from?  Basically, yeah.  That's got to be so annoying.  Where are you from?  Yeah, I live in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  We're living here in Allentown.  Are they tearing all the factories down? 
[00:25:00]  Have the union people gone away?  Yeah.  That whole thing, Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe.  When I was a kid, like, everybody would say Tigger from Winnie the Pooh.  I always thought, like, oh, that's a cute little rhyme about Tigger from Winnie the Pooh.  Yeah.  This guy's a joke.  Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe.  Catch a nigga by the toe.  Jesus.  Hollis, let him go. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, also, real quick, that whole thing about affering me poor, about being a dick thing.  Yeah.  Addiction's the wrong word for it, but, like, when I used to take it, I don't take it anymore.  I would take it whenever I felt extra stuffy.  And it was, like, my cold would last 10 to 14 days.  And it wasn't, addiction's the wrong word for it, but your nose gets used to it.  Yeah, well.  Well, if your nose, yeah, whatever, yeah, you know what we're saying.  Yeah.  I didn't plan that your nose was out sucking dick for more afferent. 
[00:26:00]  Your nose does get used to it, which means you've got to keep using it.  I understand.  Thank you.  All right.  It's well.  Thank you.  Why don't you get a job, Tigger?  See?  It's little Tigger.  What happened to sticks and stones?  Charles.  May break my bones.  What are you talking about?  Names will never hurt me?  Words hurt, though.  We learned that.  Yeah, words hurt. 
[00:26:30]  That went out the window.  They tried to tell us that years ago.  We didn't buy in.  Sorry.  We didn't buy into that whole concept.  Mm-hmm.  So that's the first apology today.  The first apology.  But that's not the last one, right?  No, no.  Oh, man.  There's cheerleaders outside fucking Fox News today.  Yes, they're supporting Donald Sterling.  Oh, man.  Donald Sterling has cancer.  Yeah.  What?  And the Post thinks that's hilarious.  They think it's great.  Really?  You should get cancer. 
[00:27:00]  I hope you get cancer.  The Post said, Donald Sterling has prostate cancer.  And then the Post, under that headline, said, looks like God has a sense of humor.  Does God have a sense of humor?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  So you want somebody to get cancer?  Yeah.  Again, for being a bigot and possibly a racist.  If someone's a racist now, you can say anything about them.  Right.  They're like the communists in the 50s.  Right.  And this is exactly like the McCarthy shit. 
[00:27:30]  Like, you know, are you a racist?  Do you know any racists?  Have you ever said racist things?  It's fucking nonsense.  It's exactly what it is.  The New York Post today is very happy that he has cancer.  That's insane.  And thinks that God has a sense of humor for giving him cancer.  Sure.  Wow.  That's kind of twisted, I think.  Yeah.  But didn't he have it before he said those things?  Probably.  I don't know.  Probably.  Oh, that's terrible.  Well, God would know what he was going to say.  Because God knows everything.  It hollers, you're a moe. 
[00:28:00]  Because you want the camel toe unless you're a moe.  Of course.  And you yell at us.  A moe.  Kids are hilarious.  So we got a newspaper, the Oklahoman.  The Oklahoman?  That's exactly what it is.  Jesus.  Apologizes for calling Thunder's Kevin Durant Mr. Unreliable.  Now, what is bad about that?  I don't know.  Why are you asking me?  Is that a stereotype?  I don't know.  That should be uttered?  Because a black guy being unreliable would be a stereotype. 
[00:28:30]  We're, we're, I don't know.  We're, we're out of this game.  I don't get any of this anymore.  Insanity.  It was, it looked like it was on the front page.  It said Mr. Unreliable.  So Kevin Durant, you know, having a bad game or a bad series, I'm not really sure because  I'm not following that particular series.  All right.  So he's not reliable on the court.  The Oklahoman has apologized after running a headline that labeled Thunder All-Star Forward  Kevin Durant Mr. Unreliable.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  Sports editor Mike Sherman admitted that that newspaper failed with its headline, which 
[00:29:00]  appeared in large letters above a photo of Durant surrounded by three members of the  Grizzlies, the headline Sherman said was overstated and unduly harsh and left the impression that  we were commenting on Durant's season career or even character.  We were not.  We were referring only to the Memphis series.  That's, that's fine.  When the fuck is a sports page ever apologized for a headline saying an athlete stunk? 
[00:29:30]  Right.  What?  I think if he was a white guy, would they be apologizing?  I don't know.  Does this have anything to do with that?  Does it have anything to do with grace?  Or was this finally the right thing to do?  Like there's an inaccurate headline that they're like, I heard that was stupid.  If he's unreliable during the this particular series, but I think everyone understands that  by just seeing all sports fans who are watching that series and they're big Kevin Durant fans  are probably disappointed and wishing he would step up more.  Because he's unreliable.  So they, they all understand the headline. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  They didn't have, they weren't looking deeply into that.  He's having a bad series.  He's Mr. Unreliable.  Right.  His mom tweeted them.  The Mr. Unreliable headline triggered negative reaction among Thunder fans.  All right.  Too bad.  Exactly.  Thunder fan.  When you're a, when you're a fan of a team and your guy is letting you down, man, there's,  there's ugliness that happens, period.  Yeah.  They'll turn on you.  Wow.  Let's see. 
[00:30:30]  Triggered negative reaction among Thunder fans, Oklahoma City media members, and basketball  observers across the country.  One writer for DailyThunder.com, a website that covers the team, called the headline,  the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  The headline, not the apology.  Durant, meanwhile, chose not to fan the flames.  Coming from my paper back at home, that's what they're supposed to write.  So Kevin Durant's cool with it.  Yeah, why?  Durant told reporters on Thursday.  I didn't come through for the team, so they got to write that type of stuff. 
[00:31:00]  As a player and as a competitor, it's going to be good and bad days.  People are going to build you up.  They're going to break you down.  They don't allow you to stay even keel, and I think that's what I am.  Support the team.  So where the fuck are they apologizing for this?  Yeah.  The guy's cool with it.  He's fine with it.  His mom wasn't?  Is that who?  Yeah, his mom tweeted.  What did she say?  What was that?  She said, typical Oklahoman on Kevin.  Unbelievable.  Kevin is reliable.  But he's not reliable in this particular series. 
[00:31:30]  That's your mommy.  Of course she's going to defend him.  And I don't know what his numbers are for this series.  But then the general manager for the Thunder also said, Kevin is the absolute definition of reliability.  Well, then they've got to apologize.  That's right.  So that apology went down as well.  Oh, boy.  Is there another one?  The worst one yet.  Total Rock.  It's worse than those other two.  Wow.  Much worse. 
[00:32:00]  Total Rock community manager let go after Donald Sterling Twitter remarks.  All right.  What is Turtle Rock?  Is that a game company?  Or they make games?  Yeah, I believe so.  Yes.  Turtle Rock.  Josh Olin, the community and e-sports manager of Evolve developer Turtle Rock Studios,  is no longer with the company in the wake of a series of remarks related to vilified Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling.  What happened?  Yeah.  Olin, a former community manager at blah, blah, blah, which had something to do with Call of Duty. 
[00:32:30]  Call of Duty.  Call of Duty Black Ops.  He's a community manager.  Said on Twitter on Wednesday, here's an unpopular opinion.  Donald Sterling has the right, as an American, to be an old bigot in the security of his own home.  He's a victim.  That's what got him fired.  That's it.  That's it.  That's an opinion on someone's opinion.  And not that outrageous.  No.  A lot of people are saying it. 
[00:33:00]  We have been saying it.  That's not, you know.  We ought to apologize.  You should be able to say some nasty shit in the privacy of your own home.  Wow.  When you are raised in an era where segregation was perceived as right, that will stick with some people.  Does it make him a monster?  Is that what the guy said?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is him.  That's the other tweet, right?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, wow.  And that's a very realistic thing to say.  It's just not popular because people, when you're a racist, they want to just get rid of you. 
[00:33:30]  You have been kicked from our company for racist activity.  That was the tweet he sent out after the first one because, you know, he was trying to explain himself further because he got some shit on Twitter.  Olin later clarified that he believed Sterling was a victim because of illegal wiretapping resulting in a massive, life-altering breach in privacy.  He's totally right.  He's right.  That's exactly what happened.  It's crazy.  Today, Olin tweeted, he was expressly not defending Sterling's remarks or actions. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  But the fact that he has to clarify that, like, no one thinks he's defending his—like, it doesn't sound to me like he's defending his—he's saying that the racism is fine.  Even if he was, who cares?  Oh, God.  You know what?  I should apologize to all the people—and I really mean this—that I've said, use your real name.  Yeah.  Like, you know what?  It's hard for me to say that because this guy gave a genuine opinion.  Right.  Under his own name.  Under his own name.  An opinion.  A real opinion.  And look at the repercussions.  So you know what? 
[00:34:30]  In this day and age—  I'll shut up about the fake names.  I apologize.  We believe what you guys don't.  It stinks.  He said, final thoughts.  I believe in racial equality and do not endorse bigotry in any way.  I also believe in free speech and decry sensational media.  But this is where everyone has to step up.  And the culture that we allow to function this way, everyone should be disgusted by this firing.  That's amazing.  And people should be going to this company and going, you can't fire a guy.  Good, good.  Yeah, get rid of them.  Good.  For having an opinion on a hot topic that everyone's talking about. 
[00:35:00]  You can't walk around without hearing Donald Sterling's name these days.  No.  And no one is saying, I agree with what he said.  Right.  Like, no one's saying that.  You can disagree with what he said and think it was terrible, but not appreciate the fact that he was wiretapped illegally, pretty much.  I have a real problem with how they got that, you know, info.  Who wouldn't?  It's amazing.  People don't have a problem with that.  Everyone should have a problem with that.  Yeah.  Because you'll be next.  Yep.  Your pals around work will just put their phone down and record you. 
[00:35:30]  No problem.  The situation appears to have come to a head today with developer Turtle Rock tweeting,  The comments made by our former community manager stand in stark contrast to our values as a game development studio.  Is that the game development studio, by the way?  Yeah, that's a fucking, what's the word, a single first person shooting game?  Right.  It's great.  That stuff doesn't violate your values, putting a first person shooter game out there where you're mimicking murder. 
[00:36:00]  But if he defends a guy's right to be a bigot in his 80s and saying he shouldn't be wiretapped, that's against your values.  Got it.  We sincerely, and here comes the word, everybody, for the third time today, apologize for his remarks,  and in no way endorse or support those views.  They don't endorse or support the view that people shouldn't be recorded illegally?  Right.  Because that was really his point.  His point wasn't that this guy is a wonderful person and I wholeheartedly endorse what he said. 
[00:36:30]  And they also don't support free speech.  Apparently not.  That's what he was talking about, too.  You know, where you have the right to be offended.  Remember that?  Turtle Rock Studios are assholes.  No, I mean, Turtles, sure, they like the music.  Oh, wow, that was really bad.  Yes, it was.  I apologize sincerely.  You should apologize sincerely.  You reset the clock.  Jimmy apologized.  Olin fought back a little bit, said the situation was very poorly handled by malleable management. 
[00:37:00]  Olin sent an email to Polygon, whatever that is, that it appears he was fired and called the situation developing.  He provided the following statement.  Anyone who follows me knows my tweets were not in support of Sterling's actions.  He'll probably sue the company.  Yeah.  I hope he does.  I hope he does.  Rather, they were promoting three core tenets, I believe, in one, the harm sensational media presents to society.  Sure.  Good, good.  Sure.  We have talked about that.  Number two, the importance and sanctity of your privacy within your own home. 
[00:37:30]  Good, good.  Sure.  And number three, the right to be whatever you want to be as an American as long as it isn't hurting anyone else.  That last point, not to be confused with condoning Sterling's actions.  Which I don't.  Very good.  That said, it's disappointing to see that a select few in Turtle Rock and 2K Games Management bought into this hysteria without even having a conversation with me or even thoroughly reviewing the context of the tweets themselves. 
[00:38:00]  Ironically, it serves as a great example of why I hold tenant number one above so close to my heart.  That said, everyone should totally still buy Evolve.  I guess their new game.  The guys and gals making the game know their shit and are making it good.  Oh, man.  So he doesn't want to hurt his fellow employees that he's pretty close with.  No.  Oh, not like anyone would boycott the game because of what he said. 
[00:38:30]  Wow, man.  Or his firing.  Wow, the guy just had an opinion.  That's crazy.  Just an opinion.  Not even that outrageous.  That is being fired based on nothing.  There was nothing in his tweet that was crazy enough to get him fired.  And that is a first-person shooter game, Call of Duty.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  I'm terrible at it.  I do love it.  Let's see.  Crazy.  Don't have an opinion. 
[00:39:00]  Let's see.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Todd in D.C.  Todd.  Hey, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Hey, buddy.  I'd like to know if the New York papers are going to apologize to A-Rod for calling him Mr. Choke-tober from several years ago.  Well, he does choke.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  He chokes in October.  Yes.  They should apologize for not mentioning September, too.  Right.  Punch it out, boys. 
[00:39:30]  I think the Mr. Unreliable is the worst one, actually.  Because that is like...  Terrible.  He's having a bad series, and they put that on their paper.  It's very...  And they're apologizing for that?  I think everyone assumes...  Anyone that knows Kevin Durant knows, in general, he's very reliable.  But he's just having a bad series.  So you can say that.  Oh, gosh.  The apologies.  People are getting caught up in the apologize preemptively now.  Yeah.  Like, it's these preemptive apologies. 
[00:40:00]  No one's asking for them.  Right.  No one's said anything, really.  And then you come out and go, uh-oh.  I better own this before I get jumped on.  It gets worse.  Yeah.  Worse.  Josh in Philly.  B-b-b-boy.  That should be immediate fucking click.  Right?  No, you gotta check out Turtle Rock's Twitter.  Why?  Check out their picture.  Just tell a fan to go to it.  Oh, their picture?  What's wrong with their picture?  Diversity?  There's so much diversity in their company picture. 
[00:40:30]  Let's just take a look.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Hey, wait a minute.  Wow.  I don't see much diversity.  Wow.  It's all really white guys.  It's a white nerds.  Of course they're white nerds.  Who else goes into that business?  Well, they seem like a company that, you know.  Well, they ought to get a little more diverse.  Looking out for everyone.  They ought to get a little more diversity in there, I think.  I don't really believe in forced diversity.  I do.  Bunch it out, boys.  All right.  I mean, if there's people from other walks of life that are damn good at their jobs, 
[00:41:00]  then sure, you should hire them at Turtle Rock.  But they have decided that only really white guys in general are what they need for the company.  Isn't that saying, like, a bunch of white nerdy guys are pretty much the ones that are good at making video games?  That's just the way it is.  In those companies, you know.  I'm sure there's some black guys that are just as good at that.  For the most part.  I mean, the numbers work out that there's probably way more white guys. 
[00:41:30]  But it's like anything else.  You know, you go into a fucking hip-hop studio and watch.  There's probably a lot of black guys in there.  Right.  You know, but that just goes.  Don't forget about Macklemore.  Macklemore.  Look at old Macklemore.  I'm not saying 100%, but, you know, there are certain things that certain ethnic backgrounds do better than others.  And to inject diversity into it only undermines it and makes it worse.  This whole thing that diversity makes everything better is a lie. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  It's a lie.  I want to apologize for my last statement that I said about diversity before anybody jumps on me about it.  Diversity is a great thing.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio and members of the Opie and Anthony show do not agree with Anthony's statements about diversity.  I don't think your company should be forced to hire people.  Opie apologizes for that last statement he made.  I don't fucking know.  People shouldn't.  He apologized for hell no. 
[00:42:30]  He apologized for no.  He apologized for no.  No.  He apologized for no.  The best person.  The best person.  He should get the job.  He should get the job.  He apologized.  A guy that's more qualified doesn't get the job because you have to worry about diversity within your company?  Yes.  I will never understand that one.  Sorry.  That makes sense.  And then finally on this topic, the NAACP.  Ah, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  The L.A. president has to resign over the Sterling controversy. 
[00:43:00]  What did he do?  Well, they're questioning him because, let's see, let me just read this.  Intern President and CEO Lorraine Miller has accepted the resignation of the Los Angeles Chapter President.  Shit.  After questions surfaced as to why his branch honored L.A. Clippers honored Donald Sterling.  Good.  You know what?  Good.  Ah, yeah.  The fucking NAACP kind of, they always skate with shit like this. 
[00:43:30]  Bit him in the ass, didn't it?  I asked black guys like Sherrod and I'm like, why were they honoring this guy in the first  and they're like, because he gave money.  He gave money.  That's the only reason.  That's it.  They don't give a fuck.  You could pay for a fucking honoring.  Yeah, but maybe they felt like he was doing some good things as far as that part of it  goes.  Apparently, if you just look at it on paper, he was.  Right.  He was.  He employed a lot of black people.  He gave to black causes.  What was going on in his mind behind closed doors is irrelevant. 
[00:44:00]  So what did we get today?  We got two apologies, one firing, and one resignation.  Yeah.  All that in one day.  One day.  As we reset the apology clock.  Damn.  Guaranteed over the weekend.  Get this out to the media.  Yeah.  We here at the Opie and Anthony show want to know if we could go 10 days without some  idiot in America having to apologize.  Having to apologize.  For something, by the way, completely ridiculous. 
[00:44:30]  Ridiculous.  Right.  I don't think we do it anytime soon.  Nope.  The apology clock is ticking.  I'd be surprised if we get through this show without something popping on the news  about an apology.  Another one?  Yeah.  Nah, come on.  Now you're crazy.  It's just insane these days.  And Shaq is apologizing still.  About the disabled guy photo?  With the face.  He made the face?  I made the face. 
[00:45:00]  He were making a retail face, so I made the face.  I didn't know he was.  I don't know.  Nah, we did it.  We did it for everybody yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Now I'm scared to do it today.  Apologize.  Can't use that word too much.  No.  Got to be careful.  Got to use that one sparingly.  Amazing.  You got to use all those words sparingly.  Sparingly.  Right.  You got to pepper it around a little bit.  Use them in characters like Mr. Armour's.  Add a little pepper on your food.  You don't dump the whole fucking thing. 
[00:45:30]  Nah, nah, nah.  You got to shake it out.  Right.  A pinch.  You're out there.  A little pinch.  Where's my fucking allergy medicine?  Uh-oh.  You got like three things over there.  Yeah.  I'm pretty clear.  That looks pretty heavy duty.  The one with the big blue butt plug on it.  Yeah, but this is two years old.  Oh, no.  Because I get this shit, and then like after a week,  I don't need anything anymore.  Sits in the old medicine cabinet.  And then, you know, it's always a pain in the ass  because these doctors...  Yeah.  I have one fucking doctor.  He's my allergy doctor. 
[00:46:00]  And I'll call him up and go,  allergy's hit again.  And he wants me to come into his office.  Why?  I'm like, you don't need me in your fucking office  just to get...  You know what it is.  Just to get a little more money from me.  Yeah.  You know exactly what it is.  I went through all the tests.  I did all the pricks up and down my fucking arm.  Did you?  I know exactly what I'm allergic to.  He was the guy that said,  you're allergic to trees and grass.  And I said, okay, good.  What trees and what grass?  And he said, no. 
[00:46:30]  Trees and grass.  All of them.  Meaning all.  So just don't go outside ever.  Well, when this pollen shit especially hits.  Trees out there.  Grass out there.  So why do I have to go back to his office  when I feel miserable  and I can't leave the house for a little while  until this pollen, like, calms the fuck down?  So why can't he just call in my shit?  Just call in your shit.  So that's why I got stuff that's two years old  because this is what he would call in.  And some people say the expiration dates on this shit  is bullshit.  It's all bullshit, yeah.  Because they just want you to buy more stuff. 
[00:47:00]  Why would this shit go bad in like a year?  The whole thing is a scam, supposedly.  Pharmaceutical scam?  Yeah.  Ooh, look at you.  Oh, you just wasted a...  A spray.  A spritz.  From two years ago.  Two year spritz.  This expired.  I'm not even joking, man.  August of 2012.  My medicine cabinet is full of ex-girlfriends' psycho drugs.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there's like, oh, I remember her.  And it's like fucking...  You remember them from the pill bottles?  It affects her in there.  And then there's another fucking, like, lithium.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[00:47:30]  I remember them from their pill bottles.  It's like, oh, I remember this girl.  There's some fucking...  Right.  ...fucking Xanax.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  Crazy girlfriend fucking drug bottles.  That's what I remember.  Fuck the pictures.  I remember from prescription drug bottles.  Can't I just call my doctor and say, here, I'll just send you an envelope.  I'll put a couple hundred bucks in, because this is what you need today, and just call  on my shit.  That's crazy.  What is he going to learn if there's no reason to go back in there?  He could get in trouble.  How? 
[00:48:00]  There's a fucking dentist that got in trouble for giving out fucking, like, massage prescriptions  to too many people.  Like, gave out to three people, and they were getting him in trouble.  I'm looking at Travis.  This might be a Seinfeld.  What?  Oh, you're not even looking.  Was it a Seinfeld?  It might have been.  I don't know.  Is it Travis?  I don't remember that one.  No, I was talking about a dentist that got in trouble for giving out prescriptions  for massages.  I read about that.  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  It happens. 
[00:48:30]  You got in trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the people didn't even need the prescription.  Yeah.  Her name was Elaine.  Yeah.  Let's go to Paul in Alabama.  Hey there, Paul.  Oh, my, my, my.  Hey.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Oh.  Hey.  I didn't realize he said that.  Did you say, hey, buddy?  No, I said, hello.  I just said, hey, Jimmy, but he said, happy birthday.  Oh, that one.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah.  People, update your fucking hellos on the phone.  I know.  Go ahead, Sarah.  B-b-b-boys should get you hung up on.  Immediately.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Should get you shot in the face.  That's right.  With a bunch of cum.  Yes.  Then again, why reward him?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Yes, sir.  There's a South Park episode where Randy Marsh has to guess a word, and then he has to apologize  to Jesse Jackson. 
[00:49:30]  Oh.  Pull it up and watch it.  It's good.  Oh, what do you mean?  We've never seen this thing before.  Oh, boy.  Can you explain it further?  What's this South Park about?  Yeah.  What was that?  What do you want to hear?  Have you seen it?  No, I mean the whole show.  What's it about?  I never heard of it.  Yeah, we never heard of this one.  What is it?  A cartoon?  Slobo!  Slob-o.  Slob-o.  Is he trying to turn us on to something we've seen a million times? 
[00:50:00]  Of course he is.  Is it the end thing?  I don't know if it's that one.  Which one is it?  I think it was the one.  Is it not the Wheel of Fortune one?  No, I think it's the one where he was apologizing to Jesse Jackson, like kissing his black ass.  Didn't they have to kiss his black ass?  Yeah, but South Park doesn't really like you, seeing their clips online.  No, huh?  They'll make it a little harder.  There was a huge lawsuit with Viacom and YouTube, a billion dollar lawsuit.  Are you cheeky?  No, there was a joke.  Because I know when I was going through my legal thing, I was talking to a lawyer who actually deposed Colbert and Stewart. 
[00:50:30]  It was just part of the thing.  He said Colbert was so funny because he would either answer as Stephen Colbert, the guy, or as Stephen Colbert, the talk show host.  And in order to know which one he was answering, he would put his coffee cup on a certain side.  That's me answering as Stephen Colbert as the talk show guy.  He's a psycho.  He was really funny apparently in the deposition.  I don't even know who won it, but I just know there was a gigantic lawsuit by Viacom.  Well, wow. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, they should put all their videos on their site.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, that makes sense in the end, I guess.  Certainly.  All right, let's see this.  And sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune.  Oh, yeah.  And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson.  The puzzle you were solving was people who annoy you.  Well, like anybody else thought it was naggers.  I mean, right?  Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture. 
[00:51:30]  Visit black museums.  See black performers and artists.  Oh, I will.  I'm really down with African-Americans.  Do you really want to apologize?  Are you sure?  Yes, absolutely.  Very well.  If you want to apologize, I will accept.  Oh, thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Thank you.  Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing.  Ready to go, sir. 
[00:52:00]  Pulls his pants down.  Kiss it.  Huh?  He has to kiss his black ass.  You want me to kiss your, that's right, I apologize.  I apologize.  Okay, I'll see you.  Apologize.  This is exactly it, though.  I kiss my black ass.  Jackson accepts apology.  That's exactly what we're living in right now.  Yep.  Kiss my black ass. 
[00:52:30]  All right, we'll take a break.  What's going on today?  We got Tammy Pescatelli coming in.  That's very cool.  Hey, the Pescatelli like my mother used to make it melt in your mouth.  We got the Jim Florentine coming in today.  Very cool.  Jim was, what did I see him on?  A still from a TV show?  Yeah.  Or something that he filmed?  Yeah, he got a part in Californication.  Yes.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Congratulations.  He was with David Duchovny.  Yes.  Very cool. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  We'll talk to him about that.  Exactly.  And when we get back, we've got to look at the Reverend Al video.  Reverend Al, apparently.  I've got to be honest.  Tough little time.  I heard about this.  I did, too.  I have not seen it.  Neither have I.  You haven't?  No.  Oh, what a treat.  I heard about it.  Make sure we see it cold.  Yeah.  Don't show us during the break.  Yeah.  Ah, yes. 
[00:53:30]  Dropping a lot of hammers today.  Oh, the old hammer drop.  A lot of hammers being dropped.  Right.  I think the allergy medication gets things going or something.  Oh, boy.  I think it does, right?  Because isn't it a kind of an amphetamine allergy shit?  I guess.  Like an amphetamine.  Some Sudafed in there and some other shit.  And that'll get you fucking, that'll get you going.  I dropped a whole fucking bucket of hammers today, man. 
[00:54:00]  Feeling good.  Excuse me.  There's cheerleaders out in the, um.  Yeah, but they're like, they're dressed all safe.  Well, they're dressed in your traditional high school cheerleader outfits.  Right.  When we were growing up, you absolutely saw panties when the cheerleaders went up in the air.  Oh, yeah.  Now they give them shorts.  And then their skirts would go like this for a split second.  You would see, you know, their panties.  Yeah.  Well, the good cheerleaders.  Where did that stop?  What year do you think?  The good cheerleaders, they know to, uh, they take their little skirt. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  And they roll it at the top so it comes up on the bottom.  They roll it a little.  They, Catholic schoolgirls do that too with their little, uh, Catholic school dresses.  Right.  They roll the top up and then the whole thing gets shorter and shorter and shorter.  So they look hotter.  And then they tie the white shirt up like a little fucking belly shirt.  Right.  And then they walk around looking like fucking sluts.  Wow.  Yeah, absolutely.  Good point.  Yeah.  Uh, we got a little more on Jeremy Clarkson.  Jeremy Clarkson. 
[00:55:00]  He might be fucking with everybody.  Mm-hmm.  People who know him more than we do, certainly.  Really?  Are saying.  People are saying?  Yeah.  Ryan underscore in underscore NH.  Horrible Twitter name, bro.  Clarkson apology fake.  Oh.  He always rips on the BBC and the media.  Really, really, truly apologize, excuse me, equals fake.  Wow.  I don't know.  I'm just adding that to the, to the discussion. 
[00:55:30]  So would this be, would this be akin, let's say, to one of us or Jimmy or something apologizing  to that degree and people would look and go, oh my God, he's fucking goofing.  Right.  But everyone else picks up on it as a, as a real apology.  Right.  But people that know us would know we would never apologize like that.  And he's somewhere in an office having a good laugh over the whole thing.  Right.  Laughin' and laughin'.  I really don't know for sure, but I guess we should at least add that to that discussion  there.  Yeah.  That sounded like a typical Clarkson sarcastic apology. 
[00:56:00]  Huh.  So what?  I, I, we don't know much about the guy.  Thank you.  I've seen his face.  Is this show even on in, uh, the States?  It must be on the BBC channel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know the, uh, American version has Adam Ferrara in it.  Yeah.  Adam's doing good, huh?  Yeah.  He's got that.  He's got the Nurse Jackie.  Is he still on that?  Yeah.  One of my, uh, the guys who's doing contracting work for me like last week was talking about  Nurse Jackie and how great it was. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  Adam's like the love interest.  Yeah.  With, uh, he's, he's, uh.  Mr. Soprano there.  Yeah.  He's got a lot of scenes with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen, uh, I've seen a few shows.  It's not my, it's not my, uh, my show, but I've seen it.  Cup of tea?  It's not your cup of tea?  I've seen it though.  And Adam does a great job though.  Yeah.  And it, it, that kept me interested because, you know, we know him very well.  Yeah.  And he's, yeah, he's got scenes with her, man.  Pretty good.  Damn cool.  She's a damn good actress too.  And there's Adam hanging right, right with her.  Doing, doing great. 
[00:57:00]  It's fucked up.  All right.  All right.  Let's work at the fence factory.  Fucking asshole.  Let's, let's see this Reverend Al video.  Ah, Reverend Al.  Uh, having a little of a problem with, uh, some saliva went down his throat, I hear.  So he got a little giggy.  Did he get giggy?  Yeah, he did.  Weezy giggy.  What's this about, Sam?  You just had this woman, you know, he's doing one of his interview deals or whatever where  they throw to somebody else and then they go back to him in studio, but, uh, either some 
[00:57:30]  spit or some beverage or some food or something went down the wrong pipe.  Maybe some of that, uh, uh, uh, apple pie or the cherry pie or the blueberry pie.  Oh, you think he's having some blueberry pie?  Maybe some, I was choking on the blueberry pie.  The blueberry pie.  Yeah.  And that combined with a moment of sheer panic.  I find what I say hard to swallow.  Oh, maybe that's it.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's take a, uh, a little look-see at, uh, at this here. 
[00:58:00]  At Reverend Al, uh, and make sure we gear up to play it five to ten times because one time  will not be enough.  All right.  Here it is.  Reverend Al.  Al just comes in and apologizes and just confesses ignorance.  Everyone got their hopes up.  Oh, is that good?  Oh, for a second, you're like, ooh. 
[00:58:30]  It's a giant gulp and then he hacks.  Yeah.  You know what it was?  He was about to say something nice about a white person and it's hooked on it.  That's hilarious.  That's fucking great.  Let's see that again.  Please do it again.  Yes, please.  Just comes in and apologizes and just confesses ignorance.  Mr. Ryan never apologized.  Stupid hairball.  He had hairball.  Yes.  Or it was a recording device. 
[00:59:00]  He was spying on someone.  He started to swallow it.  It was a fucking fake tooth with a camera and an asshole.  That's fantastic.  Very good.  Jack just comes in and apologizes and just confesses ignorance.  Congressman Ryan never apologized.  That cough is so good.  His head fucking goes forward.  Right.  Because you hear, they come back and he's in mid-sip of his coffee. 
[00:59:30]  So you hear him like gulp.  He's looking at the camera and then before he can talk, he goes, but his head lunges forward  when he coughs.  That's great.  Just comes in and apologizes and just confesses ignorance.  Oh, that's fantastic.  That is wonderful. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, man.  That is my ringtone.  That's a good one.  Good find.  That is a very good one.  You hear about the hookup truck in San Francisco?  The hookup truck?  That's right.  What is this?  Now you can take your little lady somewhere.  Or your gentleman.  Or your gentleman, yes.  In Frisco.  Sure.  The hookup truck.  The old hookup truck.  What is this?  Well, I guess, you know, you're with somebody, and you might want to do a little something-something  instead of getting caught in a park or something. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  You've got a truck that I guess you could call, and you could go in there for a little while.  Sounds sanitary.  A conceptual art installation consisting of a box truck converted to a sex suite on wheels,  including temperature controls, birth controls, safe sex, accoutrements.  A jizz squeegee?  Does it have a jizz squeegee?  A jizz squeegee?  Oh, very good.  We need that.  And a camera option, in case you and yours decide to make the escapade a YouTube sensation.  No, not a YouTube sensation. 
[01:01:00]  They don't allow the sex stuff.  It would be like the wrestler doing the promo.  Right.  Who heard that we talked about him yesterday.  Did he?  Yeah.  And he was trying to explain himself.  Maybe we can find that.  Maybe Sam can find that.  Please.  It's finally open for service the weekend of May 2nd and 3rd, so this weekend.  The hookup truck is the brainchild of ours, Spy Emerson.  According to their website, the box truck is a car service, like a mobile hotel room,  available for short-term rentals.  This is disgusting.  Why?  Because sex isn't a clean activity. 
[01:01:30]  Maybe they clean it out.  Maybe they hose it down.  Yeah, I bet not.  You know, a urinal's not a, you know, it's not a pretty site either, but we ought to go in there, right?  I'm not normally rubbing my dick on the fucking little urinal mint either.  Fuck, you're missing out, man.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that good?  Just tap it on there?  See, to explain your point, the room is designed with cleanliness in mind.  All right.  Everything is wiped down and cleaned before and after every person.  Mm-hmm.  A good wipe down. 
[01:02:00]  Ugh, imagine the bed is still warm, though, when you get in it.  You don't like that, like a warm toilet seat.  You don't want that either.  Did you see that one pube they missed?  Ah!  You go into the bathroom, you sit down, and like, ew, the toilet seat's warm.  Man-ass warmth.  But when, you know, when we were going through our day, you just, you found, who gives a fuck?  Um, an old door in a fucking factory?  All that.  Who cares?  And I think, um, San Francisco's known for those public toilets where, after you're done,  the whole thing gets completely hosed out automatically. 
[01:02:30]  You've seen that, right?  You walk out and it just sprays like a shower of shit all over.  It just goes nuts, and then all the water obviously goes through.  I've never seen that.  Oh, yeah.  They were known for that.  I don't know if they're still around, but that was a few years back.  Wait, the seat and everything gets wet?  Everything.  Yeah, and then it dries it.  I think somehow they blow dry it afterwards.  Oh, wow.  Maybe we can find the video.  No one's at the helm right now.  But there used to be videos online that showed what happened.  Frisco was getting a pretty bad rap during the AIDS days, you know, with their bathhouses and shit. 
[01:03:00]  So I guess if they have anything sexually inclined, they have to go with the cleanliness angle.  They sure do.  I just started watching last night, and the band played on.  Have you guys seen that?  Oh, the AIDS.  Matthew Modine.  It's got a tremendous cast.  I saw that years ago.  It was pretty good.  About the doctors who first began identifying AIDS with sexual.  What is this?  Is it a gay guy thing, or can straight people get it?  Yeah.  And they talk. 
[01:03:30]  I'm only a few minutes into it, or half hour into it.  And they're talking about one of the guys.  They would come in with this lesion on his neck.  Yeah.  But he was the airline.  I had heard about this airline steward who was very handsome.  Oh, did you?  And how you bet I did.  But he had had sex with a lot of people.  And I think he was a French guy or a French Canadian.  And he would just fuck guys in all these bathhouses.  He didn't spread the whole thing, but he was responsible, I think, for getting it around  because he was going, you know, on a plane all the time.  Sure.  Right.  And nobody, you know, because this was the Reagan era, so they weren't giving a lot of 
[01:04:00]  money to the health care.  Who gives a shit about the AIDS?  Anything with gay on it, they weren't going to help.  So it's really interesting so far.  And Alan Alda plays the doctor.  Yes.  That they have to go to.  Right.  But I haven't gotten much Alan Alda.  Do they have to go to Korea to see because he was a doctor on that?  Yes.  And he's doing Groucho Marx-like puns and he's playing.  You got the sarcoma.  Yeah.  That was a good movie.  I remember that.  I've only seen a little bit, but it's excellent.  I've seen it in a while.  What, Travis? 
[01:04:30]  Did you want a video?  Yeah.  The public bathrooms in, I think it was San Francisco, started it where they hose down  the entire thing after you're done.  And I think there was a video of that.  Getting back to the hookup truck, there's a custom-built metal and wood bench covered with  vinyl, which is stain-resistant.  Come on!  Instead of a traditional bed, which is bedding and absorbent, this is a bench in the shape  of a C and designed to facilitate positioning for the average-sized bodies. 
[01:05:00]  So they don't care if it's two guys, two girls, a guy and a girl.  Right.  This is a game for adults who want to play with sex.  Do they drive as it happens?  You have to be nice and cool, she said, adding no drunks, but everyone is welcome to join us.  I would assume so.  There will be a party going on all the time.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  They go up some of those big hilly streets in Frisco and you fall out.  You're trying to fuck and all of a sudden you're like, whoa! 
[01:05:30]  You hit the back door.  Or take the hill.  Just take the hill when you need a little extra action.  Right, go downhill and then you're just like, yeah, you just fucking take this hill.  Use a little of that gravity to your advantage.  I don't even know if we're going to find the toilet thing.  That's fine.  It was something that was...  Yeah, that one looks familiar, though.  Go up a little bit.  That toilet looks familiar?  A little further.  Oh, that one right there.  San Francisco Public Toilet.  Yeah, this one?  Oh, one more down.  Oh, there you go.  I don't know.  Oh.  It's a big kiosk.  Looks like the size of a magazine stand here in New York. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  But that whole thing gets hosed out after you're done.  That's not the actual video of it happening.  It's just some guy walking out of it.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  That's pretty cool looking.  But it's kind of smart.  I think they were trying to get these in New York, but of course everything in New York  is so expensive that they couldn't figure out the cost of it.  It's got an English public to it.  And look, and all these tourists are taking videos inside.  They've never seen anything like this before.  This is an amazing toilet.  Automated sink.  So? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, you put your hand under it and the water starts.  Wow, that's a miracle.  Yeah.  Why would you videotape that?  Isn't that every faucet now?  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  It's probably a dead end.  But just, you know, the whole thing gets completely hosed down after you're done.  Nice.  You could probably...  Can you stay in there while it does it and get a little shower?  Probably.  Clean yourself up?  Probably.  I'm sure somebody has figured it out for a video.  Yeah.  How to fucking...  There's a motion sensor in there.  You can't just stand in there somehow. 
[01:07:00]  They can't make it that you can stand in there while the disinfectant pours over you.  Yeah.  If you find the video of them actually showing how it cleans, that's cool.  If not, that's fine, too.  If not, go fuck yourself.  That's what I say.  Exactly.  You're fired.  I want to apologize for...  Please do.  ...that last statement.  I apologize for being sensitive.  Oh.  Sam Roberts.  What'd you find, Sam Roberts?  Self-cleaning public bathroom in San Francisco.  Free.  Press the button.  Oh. 
[01:07:30]  Press the add button.  The door shuts.  Wow, that's scary.  It's like you're on the shuttlecraft.  This is sick.  It's not sick.  It smells like shit in here.  It smells like shit in here.  Of course, it's a public toilet on the street, you dummy.  You know how silly you'd look without the walls on that?  Right.  Just sitting there shitting in the middle of the sidewalk?  Well, yeah.  Walls are important.  They really are. 
[01:08:00]  And boy, do you have some around you.  Yes.  How true.  They'll have one letter on them.  I like wall jokes.  Yes.  Very funny.  Very rare and hard to come by.  What's he doing?  It's like a fucking monkey checking out the faucet.  Whatever.  We're not going to get the actual water.  Freaking out over here over water.  The video where the whole thing is hosed down.  No.  Meow.  Yes, we've heard about the plane in Vegas where you could join the Mile High Club.  I think we did that start. 
[01:08:30]  I didn't hear about that.  Yeah, man.  Fly around, let you fuck in the air.  Yeah.  It's a whole service.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Yeah, I was just...  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  I wanted to see if you had heard about that plane in Vegas that will fly you around so  you can fuck in it.  Sounds like it's going to have some of the same sanitary concerns as the hookup truck.  That's a pretty Vegas-y thing to do.  Right.  Have they?  Yeah.  You get to fuck in a plane?  Yeah.  They get you up there and you do your thing and then you get a little...  That seems so fucking, I don't know, hacky. 
[01:09:00]  Fucking flute of champagne or whatever.  Yeah, yeah, they'd probably give you that.  Give you a flute.  Why is it a flute of champagne?  It's a flute.  Stupid.  It just seems too, like, non-spontaneous.  Because you've got to go to the airport, then you've got to fucking go through all the  bullshit, get on the plane, and then it takes off and it's like, all right, it's time  to fuck.  Right.  It's probably one of those smaller...  Oh, I'm sure it's not a fucking, you know, 767.  There's the article.  Oh, why don't you have those two old broads talk about it? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, is that a video?  All right.  Dumb Hoda and dumb Kathy.  No, is that who it is?  Yuck.  Oh, I'm sure they're going to make it sound like they were sexy.  Hi, everybody.  It's Wine State Wednesday, April 2nd.  Hoda is officially losing it today.  We'll tell you why in a second.  We're all wearing blue, of course, to support World Oxygen.  They need it, they're money.  Yes, we have breaking news on our program.  Yeah, do you?  And it's going to be heartbreaking for a lot of people out there, especially in the Washington  metropolitan area. 
[01:10:00]  The meat market is going to be really depressed.  The meat market, yes.  Another wedding in our today family.  What?  Willard Scott and his longtime partner, Paris Pia.  Did Willard Scott go into a hotel room with a hooker and try to ass fuck her?  Like gifted, your husband?  Yes, married in Fort Myers and when asked what their honeymoon plans were, she said,  I'm married back.  Our whole life has been unhoney.  Willard, by the way, who's 80 years old, lost his wife of 43 years married back.  In 2002, he spoke about her, loved her.  You know, it's so terrific.  I didn't love her that much. 
[01:10:30]  You couldn't spend the last few years of your life just thinking about her?  He got over it.  He sure did.  I think if you make it to 80, maybe you should just think about the life you lost.  Just reminisce about the good times with the old hag.  You make it to heaven and there she is going, oh, thanks a lot, you fuck.  You couldn't hold out for a few more years.  You couldn't hold out a couple more years, so I was the only one.  Now I've got to share you with that broad for eternity.  Yeah, in heaven.  If there is a heaven. 
[01:11:00]  Which girlfriend or wife greets you with love in heaven when you go up there?  My dad had two.  Which one is it?  My dad had two.  How does that work?  It's ridiculous.  How does that work?  Exactly.  How does it work?  I would assume just everyone is just cool about it because it's heaven.  And what age are they?  What if you had a wife that fucking died at like 20 years old and then you live to be 80  and you go up there, is she 20 and you're 80?  What heaven is that for her to now have to be with an 80-year-old dude?  Why are you just making up just a story out of it? 
[01:11:30]  My dad died at 74 and his first wife died at 26.  There you go.  So is he there with a young chippy?  What's that?  And then my mom's going to come up in a few years and ruin the whole fucking thing?  No, he's what that is.  That's my dad's with a 20.  I want my dad to be with a 26-year-old in heaven.  It's all relative.  It's his heaven and it's her health.  Yeah.  Maybe that's how it works.  That's how it works.  My dad deserves to be with a 26-year-old in heaven.  I don't know.  Or yeah, what if you were all good and everything, right? 
[01:12:00]  But the one you really were truly in love with wasn't very good.  So she goes to hell and you go to heaven.  But since you were good and you're in heaven and you should want and get everything you want,  you can't get your loved one because she's in hell.  Can you override it?  This is all fucking crazy.  Does your goodness override her evilness?  Override the hell.  She's like, oh, you got me out.  That's a great question.  Could you get me to heaven for old time's sake?  Can't do it, Sally. 
[01:12:30]  That selfish Willard Scott had to get married at 80.  Yeah.  Fuck up the whole heaven thing.  Fucked it up for his ex that supposedly he was truly in love with for all those years.  What else do these two say?  Hoda and Kathy.  We're not the right thing to tell that story, but go ahead.  No, no.  By the way, people think we're feuding from yesterday.  We're having a smackdown, the two of us.  It's very serious.  They'll scissor and shut up, right?  I finally said something after she's here and sent my mother to the hospital. 
[01:13:00]  I went after her.  That was not me.  Could you imagine having a sit through this?  But she did have to.  It's good stuff.  Honey, I send you my love.  If you need me, I'm coming.  Like at some cocktail party and she's yapping like this?  Better take good care of my mother.  They will.  Or you'll hear about Kathy.  Kathy Lee's face is so stressed.  It's scary looking.  She's had some work done.  She can't even blink.  Hoda, you know, I've got the neck from hell right now.  Yes, you are feeling the pain.  But you know what? 
[01:13:30]  Some people are feeling no pain.  You know why?  Oh, tell them.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  So here's a question we have for you.  All right.  Are you a member of the Mile High?  No.  Do you know what that is?  If you know what it is, it might be.  Okay.  Anyway, so it's something that happens when you're on a plane and you're with someone you  It's when you take cum on your back way up in the sky.  Way up in the sky.  I always had to.  I don't know about you.  Anyway, how many times have you done it up there?  All right.  So here's the thing.  An L.A. entrepreneur decided to make some money off of his nonsense. 
[01:14:00]  I like putting the oxygen mask on and telling her her pussy stinks up there.  It's fucking great.  It's specifically made for people to have.  See, there you go.  Oh, it's a little fucking.  Oh, that looks way nicer than the hookup.  Sharky or something.  What are you talking about?  The pilot's right there.  That is pretty.  Anyway, they have music.  Is there a barrier?  And the pilot wears voice-cancelling headphones.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  How do we know that?  Because...  I don't believe anybody anymore about anything.  What?  I don't believe $799 for 40 minutes. 
[01:14:30]  800 bucks to fuck someone in the air?  For those of you people who are in it.  A good anniversary president or something?  But the whole thing about the Mile High Club is to secretly do it in midair.  Like, that's the big thrill is if you're on a commercial flight and you fuck your girl on the plane.  Just the nerves trying to get both of you in the bathroom.  Right.  Without anyone noticing.  Anyone noticing.  Or under that little blankie.  You turn sideways, put the armrest up, and you go to the sideways fuck.  Nope. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you look at the window, bitch.  You don't be around on a plane either, guys?  No.  No.  I never fooled around on a plane.  No.  No.  I'm too scared about dying in a plane crash.  Yeah, right.  I don't need my fucking...  I can't get my dick hard.  How do you get a rod?  Yeah, my cock was like a turtle in ice water.  How do you get a rod when you hear noises and think, oh, great, that's the engine going off?  You hear that story recently?  There was a boom in the past couple of days of that guy that felt up with a girl in one of the back rows of the plane.  Really?  Some teen girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was back there, and he went behind her chair, put his hand between the seats, and started feeling her tits. 
[01:15:30]  And, like, some people saw it.  And then when she kind of started moving around, he pulled his hand out and went back to his chair.  But, like, five people called the stewardess over and said, look, this guy's feeling this girl's tits.  That's the old perv switch.  I know.  That's what I was thinking when I read it.  It's like, there's no way.  This guy was just like, I have to feel her tits.  I don't care if I get arrested.  Right.  It's not like you could run away.  Right.  You're in a plane.  Wow.  Yeah.  Any more to this story? 
[01:16:00]  Where's the Hota and the fucking Kathie Lee?  Yes.  That's what the magic is supposed to be.  Supposedly.  Apparently, this guy booked through May or something like that.  But if you're in the air already, and everyone knows that's what it's for, what's the real point?  What goes on?  She's right.  I mean, what is that even?  What's the thrill?  You know what goes on?  I don't know what the thrill is, Hota.  Ask Giff.  Maybe he's fucking a hooker in the ass.  Remember?  I just know that there's a market.  I think everything is good.  This guy says he's given about a half dozen flights so far.  I bet he has.  And this is important.  There is a professional cleaning service. 
[01:16:30]  You want that?  After each trip.  We have a big thing happening right now.  We do.  We do.  American Express is going to say that.  I, I, I, you know.  What are we doing?  Wow.  What a dull presentation of that story they had.  Right.  She should have talked about how the Giff tried to fuck a hooker in the ass in the hotel room.  Do you like that story?  I love it.  It's one of the greatest stories ever.  It was in the paper for weeks when it happened.  And, oh, the audio of him. 
[01:17:00]  It's getting him back now, I'm sure, because he's probably drooling somewhere.  You haven't seen hide nor hair of that guy in, in decades.  Because he's very old.  Yeah.  He's very old.  He was a lot older than her to begin with.  Oh, yeah.  She's no spring chicken.  He played football in the old leather helmet days.  Right.  Gotta be old.  Kathy Lee's chicken is good enough for just soup at this point.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  Let's say hi to Travis in, uh.  In the studio over there?  No.  Why would we?  Hi.  His doppelganger is in Nova Scotia. 
[01:17:30]  Nova Scotia.  Dessialganger.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Nova Scotia.  I taught you to smile.  Exactly.  I didn't even want any of a Scotia.  I was wondering if you guys did hear the news go around up here out of Ontario.  There was a, it happened a couple of years ago.  Huh?  I was driving a car.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, I said, up in the news up here, there was a, uh, a teen boy, 16 years old. 
[01:18:00]  Travis, you there?  Hello?  Go ahead.  Nova Scotia.  Yeah, go ahead, buddy.  Go ahead.  We got you now.  I said there was, uh, on the news here, there was, uh, a car accident a couple years ago.  Hello?  Yellow.  What happened?  Travis?  Nova Scotia.  He's gone.  Yeah, he is.  We love our Canadian neighbors. 
[01:18:30]  I don't think it happened.  I apologize for that, uh, hang up.  I don't think it happened a few years ago.  I think he's talking about a story where a woman was, uh, in her car.  I read this, uh, I think last week.  We were going to do the story on our show, but we got busy.  She was driving her car and she, uh, killed a kid on his bicycle.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she had three kids, right?  Three kids.  And one of them died, I think.  Jeez.  And she's suing, uh, the dead kid's family because she's very distraught about that night  and what happened.  She was saying that they were careless or something, like they weren't riding properly. 
[01:19:00]  And I think one of the kids got banged up really bad.  One of them died and one just had a few scratches.  And she's saying I'm distraught because they were, they were like, I guess, uh, I don't know  if they were riding irresponsibly.  But to me, that sounds like what a selfish pig.  Yeah, nothing happened to her for, you know, killing the kid on the bicycle.  But now she's suing the dead kid's family.  It might not have been her fault, but to sue the kid's family.  Still, over the stress that she's feeling.  You got the story?  And what is that, a video?  Yes. 
[01:19:30]  Is that the, okay, yeah.  That's probably the story.  Videos rule because you don't have to read.  Don't you love it?  Driver who killed Tina suing dead boy's family for one million.  And now she is suing that family for emotional trauma.  Back in 2012, the now 42-year-old Charlene Simon.  I guess that guy was right.  It happened a couple years ago.  His friends.  They were riding their bikes.  Majewski was killed and two others injured.  According to the lawsuit, Simon is seeking $1.35 million from the families, claiming she  has sustained great pain and suffering. 
[01:20:00]  It also claims the kids were negligent bike riders.  Majewski's parents say they are shocked and devastated over the suit.  What does she look like?  I want to see her face.  You know what?  But I'm not completely against this.  I've got to be honest with you.  I'm not just trying to be crazy on this one.  If, if, I don't know.  The family has suffered enough.  I understand.  But think about this.  If it was completely this fucking kid's fault.  Right.  She, that would be traumatizing to take a life based on the fact that someone else fucked 
[01:20:30]  up.  You killed them accidentally.  It's got to fuck with your head.  But why do you want money from their family?  What do you need money for?  The insurance company.  Somehow you've got to justify that in your own head going, look, it wasn't my fault.  They obviously were way in the wrong and there was nothing I could do.  You know what?  Go see a fucking therapist.  I don't know.  Talk it out.  But to sue the family, I think it's disgusting.  You're never suing the family.  I'm sure there's some kind of a policy they have, a homeowner's thing.  Yeah, but the family assumes that you're being sued.  I don't know if there is a policy for that, man. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  That's a, yeah.  It's not like she lost her job because she hit the kid that was his fault.  Maybe she can work.  Maybe she's all fucked up.  Something about the fact that you, to take a life would fuck you up.  Yeah, of course.  And if it's completely the kid's fault, then why is she any more wrong suing than anyone  else would do?  You know, the family...  It's emotionally, yeah, it seems fucked up, but you take that shit out of it and it's  just another...  The family has suffered enough and now you have to deal with a lawsuit because...  Yeah, I think that's just monstrous.  I think so. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm not 100%.  Go get some help.  Go get a therapist or whatever.  I don't know the circumstances and, by the way, I don't even want to know them.  I don't care.  I don't think...  I don't think the kid was doing anything like crazy, like, you know, kind of...  He's riding some weird two-wheeled vehicle.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  It's not crazy.  It's called a bike.  Oh, thank you.  I don't think he was, like, purposely trying to fuck with the lady.  It's just an unfortunate situation.  Yeah.  He ends up getting killed and now she's suing the family.  That just seems...  Isn't that disgusting?  ...really wrong, man. 
[01:22:00]  And if maybe...  Really wrong.  But if the family does have some kind of umbrella policy thing that covers their fingers...  That's great for the rain.  I understand that, but...  And you're just suing an insurance company, that's not that bad.  Yeah, but as the family, you know you're actually being sued.  Yeah.  Even though it's going through insurance companies, you still know that this fucking lady is now  technically suing you because...  Yeah.  ...because your kid's dead.  For emotional distress.  That's what bothers me.  Yeah.  It's not like she went through the...  Like, say she went through the windshield and she got a tremendous physical injury. 
[01:22:30]  Uh-huh.  I have a little bit more...  What if she was waking up the past two years in cold sweats, screaming, thinking about the accident?  Well, then I think that she needs to do something.  Yeah, go talk to somebody.  Yeah.  I would see it your way in if the kids, you know, caused the accident on purpose.  She needs to do something about that.  Fucking around being assholes and then all of a sudden she tried to do the right thing and, you know...  Maybe they were riding.  Maybe.  ...kind of stupidly.  I read a little more on this article.  Oh, you're holding back. 
[01:23:00]  They didn't seem like they were doing anything crazy.  Just dumb kids.  No, but this woman's not handling it.  You know what she needs to do?  I'm trying to...  Third time.  See him jump.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Travis.  Get over it.  What is she doing?  Oh.  Yeah.  Pitching a fit.  Get over it.  I hear you.  I see they got one of those roadside memorials there with a white painted bicycle.  I didn't even know what that meant until recently.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  They paint the bicycle white and then they put it where the accident happened when somebody's  killed on a bicycle.  When you take 65th Street across Central Park, there's one.  I hate those.  Have you seen that one?  No.  That's a white bicycle right there on the side.  I hate the roadside memorial.  Don't remind us.  Don't remind us.  Who hates roadside?  I hate them.  It's a reminder that you're out there on the streets and potential death is lurking on your  shoulder.  Couldn't you just say I'm not fond of them?  I hate them.  I mean, I'm not fond of them, but I don't hate them. 
[01:24:00]  I kind of understand why they might be there.  You can't stand them.  Wow.  It's a reminder.  Yeah.  You're out there on the fucking streets.  It's a battle every day.  It's brutal, actually.  Driving, trying to stay alive.  Pitching a fit.  Pitching a fit.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Yeah.  I like this part.  I don't.  I love it.  Pitching a clit.  Taking a shit.  Squeezing a zit. 
[01:24:30]  Always crying and whining.  How did I run out of it sounds?  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get Jim Florentine in here.  And then a little later on is Tammy Pescatelli.  Very, very funny people coming into the studio today.  We'll see.  We got an employee that claims New York City Transit boss masturbate in front of him while  claiming to have a Mount Eversize penis.  Lucky devil.  Yeah.  We got a selfie gone wrong.  He's calling it that just because there's Sherpas on it. 
[01:25:00]  People climbing his penis.  We got a crazy.  Avalanche of cum.  Of course there is.  We got a crazy cat lady.  Oh, that's me.  And we got 62 students in trouble for their senior prank.  Oh, I heard about that one.  With like possible scholarships being taken away.  This is bad.  Why would you do that in this day and age when anything that happens in a school is like  this major offense?  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They went. 
[01:25:30]  I like the one thing they were doing, though.  That was kind of fun.  Urinating?  No.  The shitting?  No.  The urinating shit?  The Vaseline would be hilariously funny if they pulled it off.  We'll get into it next.  Stay there.  I love the Black Crows.  Jim Florentine in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Before we get started, Jay, I don't know. 
[01:26:00]  I retweet them.  I retweet them.  So if you follow me on Twitter, Opie Radio, I just retweeted a video from Joe, somebody  on Twitter.  MSNBC, we never have a conversation about racism.  What?  It's great.  Do they mean themselves?  We never.  It's a little mon...  Monty.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  We need someone on the computer.  I want to see that.  Yeah, we sure have someone on the computer.  Where's...  Oh, E-Rock stepping over.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Here we go.  Plug those little sausages down on those keys and...  Somebody put together a very, very good video. 
[01:26:30]  It's quick.  It's a minute.  E-Rock, do I ever taunt you off the air?  Oh, my God.  What are you doing, E-Rock?  I never taunt you off the air.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  He wasn't listening.  Oh, E-Rock.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  All right.  Sorry.  I completely apologize.  I didn't think you were going to find it that way.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is it making all the blog sites, then?  It seems to be, yeah.  Oh, okay.  This thing is pretty funny.  MSNBC. 
[01:27:00]  It's titled, We Never Have a Conversation About Racism.  And wait till the end, obviously.  All right.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Racism.  Being racist.  Racism.  Racism.  Holy shit.  About racism and race.  That's the true definition of racism.  And accusations of racism.  The intoxicating high of racism.  Overt racism and white supremacy. 
[01:27:30]  Racism.  Pervasive racism.  This is great.  Racism.  And I'm a white guy.  Racism.  Race and racism.  It ain't sponsored.  Racism.  Race and racism.  White supremacy.  This is my inner monologue.  How of racism.  Racism.  White supremacy and racism.  How deep is the racism?  The racism.  Of American racism.  The nuances of racism.  Purveyor of deep fried racism.  Are animated by racism.  Oh, I've detected some racism here.  No matter how many times we say we're going to have a conversation about race, we never 
[01:28:00]  have that conversation.  Yeah, right?  Racism.  Racism.  Uh, it's still going there, Iraq.  What happened?  It's the credit at the end.  Keep playing.  You're breaking everything.  Keep playing.  Thank you.  It still goes.  Racism.  Racist.  Racism.  Racism.  Racist.  Racism.  Racist.  Ow.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Did you hit the foot thing with your foot?  Do you need a kiss?  Fuck.  Remember your foot thing with your foot, Jimmy?  Fuck.  Fuck.  I think he just did it. 
[01:28:30]  Fuck.  What do you do?  Every two weeks.  Every two weeks?  Wait, you period?  Ah.  What happened?  Ah, that one brings me to my knees.  Oh, don't pull that cock out.  Oh, shit.  Absolutely.  The guy's in pain.  I know.  Just blowjob jokes.  Anytime you see a guy in these, while you're down there.  Yeah, while you're down there.  Exactly.  Always funny.  You ever just put your hand on his head?  Yeah.  Yeah, when am I not?  I mean, the one between his legs.  What happened?  What did you do? 
[01:29:00]  I'd love to know, so I don't do it.  Looks painful.  The last ten times this happened, you forgot, I guess?  It's this fucking piece of equipment.  It's like metal, and my kneecap right into the corner of it.  Because I was laughing so hard at that clip.  Oh.  Well, that should be removed when they do the studio up when we're on vacation.  So, I wouldn't worry about it.  I wouldn't worry about it.  A kneecap hit is the worst that could happen.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Fuck that hurts.  They'll fix it when we're on vacation, when they do up the studio. 
[01:29:30]  Absolutely.  Right?  Every time I push in this chair, I'm less than an inch away from doing it every time.  When you push in your stool.  Right.  Florentine, what a fucking place.  That's a joke.  Fuck.  Can I push in your stool?  Ah, Christ.  All right.  Ah, what the Christ.  How are you, Florentine?  Yeah.  Good.  Show your picture.  What's that? 
[01:30:00]  Show your picture there with David Duchovny.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's next week.  Mother's Day.  What do you do?  I play a pimp.  Really?  Yeah.  Do they have to, like, dress crazy for this?  No, they just said the...  Nothing.  They just wanted me in jeans and a Metallica shirt.  Do you smack a hoe?  Do you get to smack a hoe?  No, I just bring one over.  That's cool.  For him, like, hey, here's the chick.  Is he still banging really hot chicks on that show?  Yeah.  There's hot chicks everywhere.  Well, Jimmy brought it up.  Yeah.  That's what happens with sex addicts.  They bang a shitload of hot chicks. 
[01:30:30]  Jimmy doesn't like the fact that it's not accurately depicting a sex addict.  Right.  Like Jimmy would know.  Yeah.  I'm not saying it has to be all doom and gloom.  But, you know, how about a little bit of horror?  A little horror?  A little downside to it?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  The good-looking guy.  Another one?  Another ten?  He's an addict, this guy.  He sure has a problem.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  I feel bad for him.  He's sticking a hole through a hole in the wall.  I mean, question everything as you're driving home with breath on your cock.  Oh, my God. 
[01:31:00]  So you're saying there should be some twos in there.  He should be banging.  Yeah, man.  It should be a mess.  That's a fucking just a disastrous, or that butterscotch pudding story.  Oh, God.  I rubbed the girl's ass, and there was, like, that, like, liquid shit between her ass years  ago.  Holy shit.  And that's where butterscotch pudding came from.  That's fucking...  That's...  No, it isn't.  Twelve years ago.  That isn't where butterscotch pudding came from.  No, me, Mike, the term...  Oh, I thought you meant to...  Literally.  No.  You didn't have to say years ago, like, you wouldn't do that anymore.  Right.  No, but this was... 
[01:31:30]  This was, uh...  When I was still riding around getting a street girl.  I mean, that's what it is.  So it was a hooker.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll never forget it.  She was an Indian.  Right.  Did you stop?  Like, woo-woo Indian?  Once you got a whiff of it?  No.  I don't think I realized until it was, like, close...  Like, I just thought it was sweat.  I thought it was just, like, light.  I thought it was sweat.  And then afterwards...  Oh, and some smelly sweat.  Yeah.  But I didn't make the connection in the moment.  But that's what it is.  It's ugly shit like that.  It's not just you're a good author and you have, like, hot chicks coming over.  Yeah.  You fucked her before you smelled the shit. 
[01:32:00]  She sucked my dick.  She sucked your dick before you smelled the shit.  Yeah, I was just rubbing her ass in the car while she was sleeping on my dick and I just put my hand on the back.  You know?  Uh-huh.  What do you think that was?  She didn't wait?  Either bad wiping.  I don't...  It wasn't like she took a dump in my hand.  It was a hot day.  It was years ago, dude.  But I remember her telling me...  Wipe your ass on such a hot day.  Yeah, she probably didn't get enough wipes and then it was hot.  Right.  Probably old comp, too, mixed in there.  It's tough to put in a Californication script, you know?  Why?  Oh, yeah.  The company puts his hand in a crack and all of a sudden there's, like, some butterscotch.  Exactly. 
[01:32:30]  She didn't wipe all the way.  Yeah.  I had to fucking hook her to go shit in my bathroom one time.  Because, like, a lot of times, coke just makes you drop fucking just liquid shit out of you.  And one girl came over and she went into the bathroom and then she came out.  And I knew there was a problem because she closed the bathroom door behind her.  Oh, that's never good.  That's my old apartment.  Maybe she did that to keep the fumes in.  So she's not going to joke.  Right?  That's what she always do.  Keep the fan on.  Keep it off if you wanted someone else to walk in.  Oh, oh, oh.  You don't want to ruin the joke.  I got the joke.  Yeah, so you keep the door completely shut. 
[01:33:00]  You love a good shit smell joke.  Of course.  I was farting in my son's face yesterday.  He's three and a half.  And he's like, Dad, don't do that.  I'm like, why?  I go, he goes, you're supposed to do that on the toilet.  I go, no, I'm doing it right in front of you every time.  Teach your children well.  Of course.  That's right.  Yes.  I wish you'd write a song.  Exactly.  Let's write a song about that.  I think it could be a hit.  Yeah.  What do you think of the Donald Sterling thing?  Everyone apologizing.  Everyone getting fired for saying stuff.  Where are you at with all this? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I do.  I actually heard your podcast on it a few months ago.  Just in general, how we're all just telling on each other.  Oh, yeah.  It was a great podcast, Mr. Florentine.  Well, I just said, like, you know, because you can't punch anybody in the face anymore if  someone tells on you like you used to be able to.  Because you get sued and you'll get thrown in jail.  So nobody could do that anymore.  If you could, that would be a good deterrent.  Like if someone just videos somebody on the playground doing something wrong, like,  you know, as a senior in high school.  And he's like, dude, you post that.  I'm going to punch you in the face.  Yeah, well, I'm going to sue you. 
[01:34:00]  So he can't even do that.  So the kid goes and posts it.  Right.  So I said, everybody should just be lined up.  Everybody should just get a punch in the face.  Because it fucking hurts.  And it smarts.  And you get tears.  Right.  And you don't want to get punched in the face ever.  And then everybody should feel that.  Yeah.  And then if they want to go tell again, that's a deterrent.  That's what's going to happen to you.  You're going to get punched in the face once again.  Absolutely.  That's the way Jake LaMotta kept his household in order.  Yeah, we're all tattling on each other.  I always said, like, the only place you can really be around friends and say whatever you want is in your house. 
[01:34:30]  That was always my thing.  I always tell people, like, that's the only place you could do it now.  It's amongst friends in your house.  You could say whatever you want.  Other than that, you have to walk around like that.  No, I don't know.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  Now you can't even do it in your house.  If someone's over my house, this was within the past week or so, and I start blurting out some shit, I turn and just go, are you recording this?  Like, thinking, like, it's kind of a joke.  You've got to think that now.  It's kind of a joke, but I'm kind of serious.  I'm thinking, like, man, that would sink me. 
[01:35:00]  That would fucking sink me.  You could turn your phone on and record.  Yeah.  And then the screen goes black.  Of course.  And it's just sitting there.  It's the easiest thing in the world now.  Soaking up all that good racism.  Right.  I know that the laws with Crank Angers, when we did it, you're only allowed to tape, you know, two-party consent.  Like, Nevada and New York are the only two states where you're allowed to record somebody without them knowing.  Or it's a one-party consent.  It's called a one-party consent, as long as one person knows.  So if I'm taping you without you knowing, I know I'm taping the conversation. 
[01:35:30]  So I know in California you can't do that.  Why is that okay?  You know that.  I know.  It's a one-party consent, so I know I'm recording you, so there's the one party.  What a dumb law.  So that's why we always had to do the shit either in New York or Nevada when we did those calls.  But California, I know that's not the law.  So she already came out and said he knew I was being paid.  Well, she had to say that.  I know.  And everyone's buying into it.  We don't believe that.  There's no way.  You think he would have had that on tape?  Like, okay, start the recorder and then have a big argument like that?  Right. 
[01:36:00]  No way.  And say all those words?  She's trying to cover her ass.  She probably just said one time, you want me to record you when you talk about, you know, what you're going to do tomorrow for your daily?  Okay.  And she did that.  And a month later she did this shit.  Right.  Yeah, I don't believe that.  I guarantee he's going to nail her on her.  His lawyers, Sterling's lawyers are going to nail her on this.  You're going to start seeing his side fighting back.  Sure.  Him saying he's not selling the team.  He's not going to give up the team that easily.  He's going to start kicking back on all this shit about him not being able to attend games. 
[01:36:30]  I bet he appeals this whole thing.  His reputation is shit, so now he's going to go, oh, my reputation is shit, and now, yeah, sure, I'll sell the team, no problem.  Yeah.  No fucking way.  There's no way he sells it.  He tries to keep that team and he'll fight it.  I wonder if the owners know this is fun for him.  He's 80 years old.  What else does he have to do?  Right.  At this point he has nothing to lose.  Why would he also give up his team?  Well, the owners might know he's going to fight back, so of course they had a unanimous vote to make himself go.  I told you, but not one of them can possibly risk saying, hey, look, the guy, you know, I was against it. 
[01:37:00]  You can't risk that the word gets out that you were one of the guys that said, you know, I don't think you should sell the team.  That would be bad for that owner.  But you've got to think a lot of these owners think that way, don't you think, Florentine?  They probably want him out.  No, I mean think like he does.  Yeah.  They all have those thoughts in their head.  They're just not going to say it.  Right.  Yeah, and not going to get caught up.  You've got to think there's at least a couple more owners.  How much do you pay for your boy?  Right.  Try to joke about it behind closed doors. 
[01:37:30]  If this would have happened in the offseason, I think because they're still in the playoffs.  Right.  Everything could have died down and four months later the season starts and then, you know.  Yeah, they needed a fast resolution.  Yeah, because something else is going to happen in the next week where somebody else is going to yell some shit.  Something.  Rob Ford.  Yeah, that's going to be the new thing for a week.  But Rob Ford pushed it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, him smoking that crack.  I think he's going to fight it, and I don't know if they can make him sell the team. 
[01:38:00]  I know.  In the end, I don't know.  Right.  And then what?  They're going to tell him who he could sell the team to?  Because can't he just say, hey, I'm giving it to, does he have sons left or anything?  Sell it to a relative.  Right.  Right.  He could keep it in the family in some way.  Keep it in the family.  Is that going to be good enough for the NBA?  If he still has the team next year, a free agent, black free agent, is going to go there?  You know, when he gets a huge offer blown out of the water?  Right.  From, you know, the Nets were lowballing him.  There's 40 million more at the Clippers.  Are you going to go there and go, hey, you know, I met him and he's a good guy. 
[01:38:30]  You know, he made a mistake.  Exactly.  You know, we should forgive and forget.  Look at this check, motherfucker.  I know.  Exactly.  He'll have to come out and apologize and go on that.  Even though people will go bullshit, it will give the certain athletes the excuse they need to go there.  Like you said, there's 40 million dollars more.  It's hard to turn down.  Yeah.  And now we learn he has cancer.  Cancer.  And the paper's happy about that today.  The big casino.  Saying, I guess God does have a sense of humor is one of the headlines.  Oh, yeah.  Go to Dr. Kennedy. 
[01:39:00]  That's pretty twisted, I think.  Yeah.  And we do twisted shit on this show.  This will probably kill him just like Paterno with that.  All that shit went down with the little boys.  Yeah, yeah.  Six months later, he was dead.  Tons of case.  Wasn't it only six months?  Something like that.  Maybe a year.  But within a year.  A year, right?  Yeah.  Those guys can't handle allegations.  Yeah, they don't like allegations.  They're used to covering that stuff up.  Right.  Looking the other way.  To their legacy, too.  Exactly.  You know?  Yeah.  That was everything to Paterno.  Yep.  And he officially never won a game.  It's so stupid.  He took all his wins away. 
[01:39:30]  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  It's just silly.  Yeah, we'll all make believe he didn't win any games for Penn State.  Make believe.  Let's see.  Let's go to Chris in Connecticut.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Jimmy.  When you were dating Robbins, did you ever have you call her the N-word in bed?  Holy shit.  No.  Don't answer that, Jim. 
[01:40:00]  I'll answer it honestly.  No, she actually said, Jim, why did you just say that?  I don't know.  I just thought that.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  There are people that do racial play, though.  I've heard it mostly from white girls who fuck black guys.  Where the black guy wants to hear that.  There's been plenty of black guys that want white women to call them that while they're fucking.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a taboo thing.  It's a harsh.  It's almost like a reverse cuckolding.  Where you want something so humiliating and not what you'd want in your real life. 
[01:40:30]  I don't like thinking about it at all.  It's crazy.  We had a phone call at N-W, do you remember, where the guy, I think, told his woman to  put a little...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Put a little nigger in it, she said.  Or he said, right?  He said to her, I think.  Was he black or was he white?  I'm trying to remember.  He was white.  She was black.  And do you remember what happened?  Did she slap him?  She got pissed off and smacked him.  Right.  Yeah.  It was a classic phone call from N-W.  He's like, I was just caught up in the moment.  I got caught up in the moment.  I was fucking going at it.  And he told her, put a little nigger in it. 
[01:41:00]  Like, he goes, I just wanted to, you know, shake a rash or something.  And she fucking turned and smacked him in the face.  I believe they were going out, too.  It wasn't just a hookup.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Man.  Died two and a half months after the allegations came out.  Wow.  According to Chris in Philly.  Wow.  Yeah, it was quick.  Wow.  And he was healthy.  I mean, he was still on the sidelines, coaching all that stuff.  He was still going to coach another year or two.  He was still part of the team.  Hmm.  Hmm. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  I've never understood the racial humiliation angle to turn on it, I guess.  But I know, like, white guys that have dealt with black girls and, you know, slave girl.  And I've known...  I guess that's a whole thing.  Yeah, that's a whole fucking role-playing thing.  It's a taboo, like you said.  It's, you know, not supposed to do it, say it.  And then tied in with sex.  Anything fucking nasty and taboo that's tied in with sex, for some reason, makes it better.  I don't know.  Not for me.  I'm a straight-ahead kind of guy.  I like your regular fucking... 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, an occasional hair pull and choke and shit, but not, like, bad.  I'm a bad choker.  I'm a bad choker.  It's like, oh, you choked me a little.  I'm like, oh.  Look, I'll just put a bullet in your head.  I don't like this fake...  I don't like this fake shit.  I've never...  If I wanted to hurt you, I'd hurt you.  I've never choked.  Really?  Yeah.  Not at once.  Reverend Al did.  He did choke.  Have you seen it?  Yeah.  Very funny.  I never choked either.  No?  I did a role-playing with an ex-girlfriend.  I'm like, well, she was playing, like, a little girl. 
[01:42:30]  It's silly.  She had a lollipop and pigtails.  Yeah.  And I was the teacher.  Was she playing older?  And then I was in the middle of fucking her.  I'm like, I know you're going to tell on me.  She's like, I'm not.  I'm like, I know you are.  She's like, I swear I'm not.  You know what?  It was turning me on that she was going to.  And I'm like, you fucking cunt, you're going to tell.  And she's like...  And she stopped.  So she started crying.  Right.  She's like, you called me a cunt.  I go, yeah, well...  This just goes bad.  Yeah, I go, yeah, because if you were going to tell him I was going to ruin my career,  I'm going to call you guys.  The role-playing shouldn't go away.  I just reached tenure, and now I'm going to lose my job. 
[01:43:00]  I was trying to talk dirty to this chick once, and she goes, she's talking about her panties,  and I was like, oh, what, the panties your mother laid out for you?  And she fucking got all pissed off at me.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I know.  I was like, oh, trying to talk dirty.  I can't fucking do it.  I'm not a good dirty talker.  You got to discuss these things.  And then I said, I yearn for you once.  Wow.  Girl.  She was like, and I went, I yearn for you.  Ew.  I know, I know.  I'm a fucking asshole.  I yearn for you. 
[01:43:30]  I was back.  I didn't know what I was talking about.  How old were you?  I was probably a 45.  I think I was a 45.  All the fucking role-play stuff I've gotten into is...  Only in text, though, I like it.  I don't like it in real person.  Like, I like the real...  But the choking and slapping, I've done that if a girl likes it.  Well...  And I'm comfortable doing it.  Well, we got the phones lit, man.  All right.  We got to go to Chicago.  Gary.  The phones.  I fucked a Polish girl in a Nazi outfit.  What? 
[01:44:00]  What is he yelling?  Was that a slavo?  You need to bring back the Francine and Patrice slave thing.  Oh, my God.  I don't think we've ever played that again.  Now it's one of those bits we've never played that.  I think we burnt every copy of that one.  Boy, was that a fucking bad one.  Why?  I thought we were going to get into trouble.  It was two black people.  But it was really bad.  Patrice and Francine.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wasn't there spanking?  Yeah.  Wasn't that the same day as Homeless Charlie or right around there, too?  Oh, it was after that.  It was around that time, was it? 
[01:44:30]  Because it got played right after that.  Right.  Fuck.  No, we were talking.  I think I was chiming in, though, with Francine about, like, the slave girl and the one was  out in the field, one was the house, and we were saying it.  It was bad.  I think Reverend Al started sniffing around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so we started sniffing around.  He was sniffing around for real.  So we said, maybe we should bury that one.  Yeah.  He was sniffing around because of the Homeless Charlie thing.  Yeah, that was a bad one. 
[01:45:00]  And then we realized we might have some other shit.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  Slave girl.  It was the Reverend Al thing.  Slave girl.  That wasn't bad.  And then the company offered him a radio job, and then he said, all right, I'll leave ONA alone.  That's how that worked out.  I'm outraged until you give me something.  Yep, that's exactly how that one worked out.  Then my outrage goes away.  Yep.  Wow.  The brilliance of someone that's no longer with the organization.  Organization.  He was able to figure that one out for us.  Yeah.  Because he came a sniffing. 
[01:45:30]  Uh-huh.  He wanted us for a little bit there.  Yeah.  That's shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, I don't know, I'm not in a real role-playing.  Their phone sex, you know, used to be.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Wasn't there a thing, I remember when I first met you, there was some chick you used to have  phone sex with, you had to send her a check in the mail.  What?  Like once a week.  Oh, no, that was the, uh.  Wait, what happened?  Electric bill.  Wasn't there something?  Yeah, that was, uh, they used to be able to order them from long distance. 
[01:46:00]  And I would pay in advance with, like, a money order or whatever.  Oh, God.  I've told that story before, yeah.  Yeah, you've told, uh.  Doesn't Duchovny do that in the show, no?  Yeah.  I remember you had to mail her on a check, like, every week or something, like 80 bucks  or 60 bucks.  Crazy.  That might have been that one.  I don't remember.  And what did you get from it?  Like.  Just, you could call anytime you want, an unlimited dirty talk or whatever.  But I told you that, that one time I called, it was so early in the morning there, it was,  like, six in the morning here, and she's like, you wanted to talk like that this early?  And the black girls were so mad at me.  Like, I'm fucking paying for this shit. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, she was, they would probably just, like, wire it to someone's house.  If you're a full-sex operator, you've got to be ready to go no matter what time.  Exactly.  What the fuck is that about?  Step up.  The panties was from Seinfeld?  Uh-oh.  Oh, was it?  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I was just checking Twitter.  Wow.  But that one was from Seinfeld?  Panties?  Yeah, Jerry said, you know, the panties your mother laid out for you.  And the girl got all mad.  Wow.  That was on Seinfeld.  What about I Yearned For You?  Was that from Seinfeld?  That's George Costanza. 
[01:47:00]  It is.  I had a feeling that way.  He wasn't able to come up with something good to say, so he said, I yearned for you.  I yearned for you.  I believe that one was yours.  Seinfeld?  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of edgy for him.  It was an edgy one.  It was pretty good, though.  It's like, oh, you're talking dirty.  I said, the panties your mother laid out for you.  And that end of that episode is so good.  Because he's trying to keep that whole conversation, because it was someone Elaine knew, the girl.  And he's trying to keep her from telling anybody that he said that during their thing. 
[01:47:30]  The panties your mother laid out for you.  And the very end of the episode, Elaine, it was in the apartment, Jerry's apartment.  And she's ready to leave, and she goes, yeah, I've got to do some shopping, pick up some panties, or whatever the hell it is.  And then she goes, the ones my mother laid out for me.  The crowd fucking goes bullshit.  It came out of nowhere.  It was perfectly executed.  Nice.  That show's goddamn funny.  I love that goddamn show.  Well, I'm glad you think that type of humor is appropriate.  Yeah, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I know you don't appreciate the blue humor. 
[01:48:00]  What else is going on with you, Florentine?  I mean, we've got stories, but we've got a crazy cat lady, and we've got a squirrel attacking a teen after a selfie.  The regular morning radio bullshit.  The morning radio that we have to, like, try to make funny and better than other dumb shows.  Weird news.  Dude, that was in my fucking head all day.  Everybody was fucking getting that in their head.  Weird news. 
[01:48:30]  But I was hearing it like you.  I wasn't hearing their version.  Weird news.  I was hearing Anthony doing weird news.  Yes, because Scorch doesn't sing it, so it's not weird news.  But I just want to do it in the Scorch voice.  Never heard Scorch?  No.  Weird news?  It's fantastic.  Some are on and some do write stories that are very strange.  Weird news.  Yeah, we're talking about weird news that we squirreled.  Attacked a guy when he was taking a selfie.  That's nuts.  Get it, squirrel with nuts.  It's crazy.  Let's go to Earth. 
[01:49:00]  We can do this as weird news.  Weird news.  Stupid kid takes a selfie with a squirrel, and then the next picture is him running away  because the squirrel attacked him and fucking bit him on the back.  Oh, man.  Do you have to get rabies shots?  That's a good question.  I bet.  I don't feel like reading to find out.  Unless you could lop that animal's head off and they check the brain for rabies, then you've  got to get the shots.  Are the shots still really bad like we heard they were as a kid?  Growing up, the rabies shot story was frightening. 
[01:49:30]  It was a giant needle that they put in your stomach.  And they would do it.  And it was like, yeah, they've got to give you 50 shots over 25 days.  It was the scariest thing.  So anytime you saw an animal, you're like, ah, rabies.  It's probably like getting a flu shot.  Well, that's what happened when Ozzy bit a bat's head off on stage.  He thought it was a fake bat, a rubber bat, and he bit it.  Yes.  And he had to get a bunch of shots right in the stomach.  But since they had the bat there, couldn't they have tested the bat for rabies? 
[01:50:00]  Or did he spit the head out or something?  He bit into it and spit the head out.  He might have thrown it back in the audience.  Someone threw a dead bat on stage.  Or it was a live bat.  If you got the animal, even the animal's just his head.  They take the brain and they do some tests and you can find out if it has rabies that way.  They've got to kill the animal, though, to see if it had rabies.  Sometimes it's like, no, it was fine.  It would be hard to throw a live bat on stage, I'm thinking.  No, it was a live bat.  I believe it was a live bat. 
[01:50:30]  It just fucking flies away.  How did you do that?  I don't know.  He thought Ozzy, the way he told it, it was stunned by the light.  Because it was so bright.  Somebody threw it on stage and he said it was stunned by the light.  He just picked it up and bit it.  He thought it was a rubber bat.  Oh, wow.  It was like stunned by the light.  I know by the light.  It was stunned.  He was lost weight.  He went to the gym.  He needed to be better.  Stunned by the light.  Oh, Dara, I yearn for you.  Oh, Dara.  My big ballad. 
[01:51:00]  My rock ballad.  Don't we play the Weird News clip after each Weird News story?  Weird News.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Stories that are very strange.  Weird News.  Yeah.  What do you do?  Well, in Philadelphia.  Crazy cat lady surrenders to police.  239 cats removed from her home.  But that smelled nice.  Are we going to get sued by Scorch?  Me.  That would be fun.  I'm not stealing your bit.  We're goofing on you.  We're goofing on you.  He has a way of twisting things.  We're making fun of you.  We're not just stealing.  We're making fun of you.  Don't twist this. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, they're ripping me off.  That's one of Scorch's bits.  Remember when he said to Sam that we share bits.  We share bits.  We don't share bits.  We do Scorch.  You guys didn't do your dressing once.  And we love you.  We do love you at the end.  Yeah.  Lighten up.  Philadelphia.  You got 239 cats removed from her home.  Yuck.  Jesus.  Wow.  Damn.  She possesses ketamine.  What's ketamine?  That's like that tranquilizer stuff that people take in clubs.  To knock out animals. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Special K.  Wow.  Oh, Special K.  That's Special K.  All right.  We took 30 cats from her house, which has a sign in front of it reading, I'm the crazy  cat lady, and this is the crazy cat house.  Oh, that's great.  That's wonderful.  It must be wonderful being her neighbor.  Right.  The whole area must just smell like cat piss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  I hate chicks with cats.  They're always weirdos.  I hate chicks with cats.  That's 239 cats. 
[01:52:30]  Cats got to be on the bed.  It's just a...  You don't like that?  You don't like it?  No.  I don't like any of that stuff.  They're not normal chicks with cats.  Oh, sorry.  What if they just have one?  Still...  If they have one, they want more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then there's two, and there's three, and then one's...  It happened with my stupid fuck ex-wife.  She fucking got one cat, and then she got another one, and I was against fucking two.  And she got another one.  Then, of course, one's male and one's female, so they fuck and have a litter, and she keeps 
[01:53:00]  two of the kittens.  We had four fucking cats.  Like, I need that?  You had one cool one.  That's why I left her.  Jack-Jack.  Four cats.  You had a cool cat.  Wasn't the fucking on the side.  Yeah.  Jack-Jack...  No, no.  Jack-Jack was the other one.  That was JD.  Oh, JD was the cool cat.  JD was the cool cat.  He would have got along with Beavis.  Yes.  A little play date.  They could have played catch together.  Played fetch.  Because, uh, JD also fetched for you. 
[01:53:30]  He fetched.  All my cats fetched.  Do you think maybe you were fucking on the side because you were angry that she had four  cats?  Yes.  That was it.  She had four, and I decided I was going to go get some pussy of my own, as they say.  Some of mine.  Get some of mine's.  No, we were having a threesome, and, uh, and she gave me an ultimatum that, uh, either  this stops, or, um, I'm, I'm done.  I'm gone.  I was like, okay.  That's easy.  Easiest ultimatum I ever fucking went with. 
[01:54:00]  What'd you do?  See ya!  Because once you get to that level, you can't go back to the normal.  Yeah, what are we going to do?  Just one-on-one.  Go back to, yeah, stop it.  Just stop it.  It ain't going to work.  You did the right thing.  Oh my god.  I remember she'd fucking, like, she was just trying to be like the girl that I was, that  we were having the threesome with, and that I was fucking.  I was, I wasn't supposed to fuck her.  Uh, unless we were together.  Yes.  Even when you weren't together?  All on the side, yeah, because it's the rules.  Like, you know, this is the rules, where the rules schmools. 
[01:54:30]  So then she was trying to be, so she decided to shave her pussy for the first time, and  she shaved it, but then it grew in, and it was stubbly, and it felt like, I thought  there was, like, an electric shock going through my balls.  Like, sometimes they smack up against some freshly shaved, and it's like, whoa, what  was that?  It was like a pin cushion.  It was like a trick.  Wait, so she shaved it because the other girl was shaving it?  Yeah, but it didn't look good.  What did her pussy look like?  I don't know.  It didn't look the same? 
[01:55:00]  I don't really want to think about it.  Would you suck it a lot at the end?  No.  No.  All the threesomes were hilarious toward the end.  I dedicated, like, my pinky finger to the wife, and then everything else to the other  girl.  Right, yeah, you just kept it kind of clean.  I was like, yeah, yeah, here, pleasure yourself with this.  You weren't giving them equal attention?  Oh, boy, no.  It's like, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada,  with my finger, and then the rest of it is like fucking, it's like the beach scene from  here to eternity.  Oh, boy, she left out of it. 
[01:55:30]  Was she getting jealous that you were spending more time with the other one?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so she noticed?  Oh, she noticed, all right.  Yeah, you gotta work.  You gotta do 50-50.  Go from one back to the other so they don't feel left out.  You'll do that the first couple of times, but then you'll start gravitating toward what  you find better.  That's why the threesome will never really work, unless you're a couple that, you know,  is a completely open relationship or something. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  You don't really care.  Right.  If you have any jealous bones in your body, man, that threesome will fucking tear apart  a relationship, unless, you know, you know what the deal is.  Because the guy's always going to gravitate toward the new chick.  Just going to happen that way.  Or the hotter of the two, or whatever the fuck.  You're with the wife all the time.  Want some new goddamn puss howl.  Yeah, one time when I did it, the girl's like, got mad because I was fucking the other  girl.  She's like, you was fucking her the same way you fucked me?  I'm like, I only have one style.  Yeah, I've been doing the same thing for years. 
[01:56:30]  I was like, I'm not going to mix it up now, because if I did it different with her, then  you'd be like, why don't you do it with me like that?  So I just figured I'd just do it the same way.  You've got to turn it to a southpaw all of a sudden.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, all of a sudden I've got to throw it to my left.  What?  There was some weird situation.  Once, the first time we ever had a threesome, there was this girl out on Long Island, and  she was on the couch.  The wife was on her back on the couch.  The other girl was on top of her, face to face. 
[01:57:00]  And I was dogging the girl on top from behind.  So I had to look at the wife's face, because she's, the other girl's face was down, the  wife's face is up, so I had to make it look like I really wasn't into it.  I'm like, I'm making face like, I gotta fuck her.  Nah, I gotta fuck the new girl.  You wear a mouth that I love you to your wife as you're fucking a friend?  No, I'm just looking going, I don't even want to do this.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  She's here.  This sucks.  Did you have a condom on? 
[01:57:30]  For probably the first three pumps, then the old thumb hook.  I used the old thumb hook.  You make it like you're doing the fuck and diddle at the same time, and then you hook  your thumb, so when you pull back for a pump, that thing pops right off, slides right back  in.  Aren't you scared?  You don't even lose a fucking thrust.  I'd be so scared that my fucking, my fingernail is straight by cock.  Well, you gotta keep your nails trimmed.  How do you hook it in the condom? 
[01:58:00]  Oh, it's great.  Right on the, right up the, uh, fucking limb.  Well, when you don't have a lot of girth like Anthony, you can get the thumb in there  no problem.  My little, my pencil dick.  I put my fist in there with it.  Yeah.  Uh, they're saying blinds are, uh, bats are blind, so the Aussie story, they're still  are blind.  Blind as a bat?  Right.  They have, that's so normal.  Bats are blind, so how do they get, how did it get, uh, distracted by the light?  Well, it might, it might mess its, uh, whatever, sonar, they can fly during the day, but it  might've just been stunned by something else.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of shit going on in there.  Plus it was in the guy's pocket the whole show. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Now he stuck it.  Sonar shit.  Right.  Yeah, listening to Aussie music, maybe the sound.  Yes.  Sound fucked up his, uh.  It's all sound based that they fucking run on.  Maybe Crazy Train being blasted at fucking 600 decibels messed the little guy up.  Poor little fella.  He's not used to hearing that in his environment?  No.  Is that what you're saying?  He's used to...  Not fucking pot smoke and 20,000 drugs, right?  And we're gonna learn about, uh, rabies, uh, rabies, uh, shots. 
[01:59:00]  No, we're not.  Okay.  Oh, where'd he go?  I don't know.  I heard, I heard tell.  One guy said five shots.  Yeah, I heard tell nowadays.  But are the needles big like we, uh, we were thought to believe?  And do they still stick them in your gut?  I think Aussie was saying they were big and it was a lot of shots that he had to get in the stomach.  That rabies shit.  Once you fuck it.  I think I saw a documentary on some girl that was the only person ever documented that lived through having rabies.  And she's fucked up now.  All crippled out and fucking like...  Oh, she didn't get the shots.  But she, yeah.  Uh, she didn't get the shots. 
[01:59:30]  Cause she, like, got bit by something, uh, a mouse.  You're Seinfeld?  No, no, I swear.  It's real.  I swear.  No, no.  When you call me, I'll swear it's real.  It was, there's a documentary, a girl, she got bit and, uh, got rabies and so much time passed by in between the bite and when they actually diagnosed her as having rabies that once the symptoms come in, you're fucked.  You're dead.  It's like a 100% mortality rate.  Uh, and she lived through it because this doctor, uh, gave her some treatment that was never used before. 
[02:00:00]  I think they put her in a fucking coma and, and just, like, gave her some shit to kill the rabies.  It was really fucking weird, but it screwed her up.  It fucked up her body.  Bad.  Bad.  Really bad.  Weird news.  Weird news.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  I'm on a thunderbird of stories that are very strange.  Weird news.  What else we got into weird news?  Oh, I think that's, oh, we got the, uh.  Sam Roberts, he's a backstabber.  Weird news.  I wanted to ask Anthony real quick, when you took the condom off, did the girl say later, like, hey, where's the condom? 
[02:00:30]  You were wearing one before.  I don't think she gave a shit.  It was the wife that, that cared that I wore.  So what would you say, like, to the wife?  If your wife goes, what, what happened?  You're wearing a condom.  What happened?  She was drunk and passed out.  You think she remembered?  Also, she didn't remember.  So you never got called out on it.  I could have fucking, I could have used the condom like a rubber band and just smacked it into her face during the, uh, sexcapade.  She didn't give a shit.  So if your wife passed out, would you go have sex with the other one while she was passed out?  Yes.  And you weren't worried that your wife would wake up? 
[02:01:00]  Didn't care.  One time it was the morning after.  So the three of us wake up in bed and, uh, the wife's like, I'm going to go take a shower.  All right.  The second she was out of that fucking room, boom, boom, boom, boom, stop fucking commence fucking.  Where'd you, where'd you get the condom from?  Oh, good question.  I don't know.  So you, and your wife didn't know you were doing that, obviously.  She didn't know, but I think she knew.  Like, it's so, you know, she comes back from the shower.  I'm fucking sweating, huffing and puffing. 
[02:01:30]  The room smells like fucking.  Like fucking and socking.  You know, there's a giant wet spot on the bed.  Yeah, your dick looks like you just sopped up clear gravy with it.  Clear gravy.  Yeah.  Oh, I broke all the threesome rules.  All of them.  Just busted them all.  You know, look, if your wife's going to let you do that, you should abide by the rules.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that's, that's pretty cool of a chick to let you fuck one of her friends or another girl. 
[02:02:00]  So it's like, all right, at least I got to do is.  I believe it was, uh, it was, uh, self-motivated.  Like she wanted to be with girls.  I think she wanted to be with girls too.  Right.  But why were you doing that?  Why were you breaking the rules when she said, don't fuck her when I'm not around?  Because there's a naked girl in my bed.  What am I supposed to do?  Oh, wow.  The wife doesn't want me to do this.  But when she's here, I could fuck.  It just seems like something that's trivial.  Were you in the white house?  I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  I'm on your white side with this one.  I was like, all right, look, I'll take that.  What are you going to fucking rate me for a million dollars too?  No, no.  A mil.  I like, well, I respect what you did, but.  Yeah, I know.  You got to, you got to respect what I did.  More than a mil.  It was probably more than a mil.  Oof.  Yeah, I know.  Was it worth it?  I have to say it was or I'll go crazy.  So I have to sit here and, and in my own mind go, you know what?  Right.  I look at the bad and the good, look at the money versus the misery. 
[02:03:00]  How much would you have paid in taxes on that anyway?  Like that, of that?  Yes, because it was tax, uh, taxable to her.  So.  So you would have wound up paying a decent, at least a third of that in taxes.  I mean, that's probably 39%.  Whoever's in offense.  It's still 35, 39%.  It's a fuck boat of money.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  But a lot of guys lose a million dollars and don't fuck their wife's best friend.  That's true.  But I got to look at that.  At least you got something out of it.  You got to have a bunch of them with a couple of chicks, um, uh, over time.  They were different girls too, so it was kind of cool. 
[02:03:30]  You got something for your money.  Yeah, you definitely did.  Yeah, yeah.  You got a little on, you got a little return on your money.  There was one time at a friend's house, there was another girl out on Long Island.  And, uh, we were, we were kind of fucking around with this other girl.  And, um, and I just left the bedroom that we were staying, we were staying at a friend's  house up in the upstairs bedroom.  And I just left the bedroom, went downstairs to the other girl's bedroom just because she was  passed out upstairs.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Oh, your wife was, so you went downstairs.  Yeah, so I went downstairs to the other girl.  Did you get back in the, uh, wife's bed before morning? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, before morning.  I had to get back in.  She didn't know.  No, no.  She didn't know.  Now, what if she would have walked in on you, like, ten minutes later as you're downstairs?  I was like, I was just gonna call.  I was just gonna call you.  Were you?  Where were you?  No.  That wouldn't work.  That wouldn't work.  My dick's in there just like, I was just gonna fucking get you.  This is great.  I was just lubing her up.  I was just warming it up for you.  I was just warming up in the open, Dizzy Dean.  Yeah, honey, come on down with your sleep breath and get involved with me and this girl  who already fucked you.  I was just breaking in the old mitt for you. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, shit.  That wouldn't work.  Now, did the girl, like, downstairs go, hey, Anthony, you shouldn't be doing this.  You want to sleep?  Yes.  Yes.  Did you need, like, a night to sleep on her?  Go, let me think about you bringing another woman because it might screw up our relationship.  No, because the actual, the proposition for the first one came down at a gig that I was  at with Opie.  That was our going away party.  Our going away party for fucking BAB.  Right.  And, uh...  We were making the move to AF.  They threw us a nice going away party.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  And it was there for 15 minutes because this thing was going down right in front of his  eyes.  And he's like, all right, see you later.  I'll see you in Boston.  And took off.  The wife comes over to me and she goes, oh, Cindy wants to, she goes, she wants to come  over and watch us fuck.  I'm like, all right.  Who said that was it, Jan or Marsha?  That was Mr. Brady.  I'll pull the car around.  Oh, he was out of there.  I was out of there.  Lickety split.  And, uh, driving, and I was pretty kind of ripped, you know, and driving home, all I'm 
[02:05:30]  thinking is like, please don't get pulled over.  I would, I would tell the cop, look, officer, I will, I will voluntarily drive to the police  station after this is done and you can book me for DOE.  But please, please, I'm begging you.  And you got to get that done quick.  If it's going down, you got to get, get back to, don't let them think about it.  Cause they're all the chicks overanalyze everything to begin with.  You know, these are the good move to stop at a diner on the way.  No, no, don't feed them. 
[02:06:00]  I'm a little hungry.  No, you don't want to feed them.  Fuck that.  They sober up.  They see you in those frigging lights.  That's it.  It's like, this guy's not that good looking.  What am I doing?  Right.  They start reassessing the marriage.  And then, yeah.  And then they got that, that shitty food in their belly and it starts fucking rumbling.  So you go to the diner afterwards?  Yeah.  Cause then they got the gas.  They feel this gas.  Do you tell them, do you tell them we'll eat afterwards?  Yeah.  You tell them that.  Then they just pass that.  Yeah.  Just say that.  We'll get them.  I got food back at my place.  Right.  When you get home, you don't want them getting tired and falling asleep. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And it can't be a long ride back from the club to the house.  If it's an hour, you're fucked.  That's too long for them to think about it.  They get cranky in the car.  Cause they don't have their cocktails.  They weren't making out in the van, which was good.  That's good.  But you got to get them back quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to be close.  How long was it?  Probably 20 minutes.  That's not bad.  Were you turgid by the time you brought it to your house?  I was steering with my cock.  I was fucking juggling.  Just thinking what's going to go down.  I was very, very excited at the prospect of this whole thing. 
[02:07:00]  This whole shindig.  Yeah.  And you can't get it.  Don't stop.  They always want to get snacks.  No, no.  Beelined it right back to the house.  Got the action going immediately.  Immediately.  How long have you got to touch the other chick?  Immediately.  Oh, you did?  No, actually, because it started out like, oh, the guys was, she wanted to watch us fuck.  So I was like, all right.  Yeah.  And then she came over and started, like, making out with the wife again.  And then I'm right there. 
[02:07:30]  So I, you know, my hands start going.  You touched her hiney and her tits?  I touched everywhere.  Everywhere.  Did you fuck her?  Yes.  Oh.  Your wife was okay with it?  I don't know.  Did your wife lick your balls while you fucked her?  No.  No.  That would have been good, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did the girl lick your balls while you were fucking your wife?  Uh, no.  No.  There was no ball licking that was on during that time.  No.  It was during the course of the night.  It was pretty, uh, pretty good. 
[02:08:00]  They both get your head together?  A couple times.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  That happened.  That was good.  Kissed it on your dick, right?  That was good.  Fuck.  Yeah, it was pretty, uh, pretty good.  Dirty girls.  It was filthy.  Yeah.  But this was, you know, fuck, 20 years ago?  Holy shit, that was 20 years ago?  20 years ago.  God damn.  So what's the conversation in the morning with your wife?  Hey.  About it.  Hey, now get in the kitchen and cook me breakfast, cunt.  That's right.  Did you do it?  I'm the cunt, I guess. 
[02:08:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This should have been our, our unmask.  Yes.  Fuck 20 years of radio.  It should have been the 20 year anniversary of your, was that your first threesome?  Yeah, that was the first one.  Yeah, that's, that should have been the unmask.  That was the first one.  That was pretty good.  We can redo the unmask.  Yeah.  We'll just do that.  And then I realized, and I guess the wife at one point said, like, uh, I think I'm  like, like 70% lesbian and 30% like straight.  So she was always, and I was just always. 
[02:09:00]  searching for the next one, like  somebody that was game for it, and then I would approach  the wife and be like, hey, you know, I kind of found  somebody, which I did.  And then, you know, that ended the marriage.  Well, didn't you? Usually  you should let the girl pick him out.  Yeah, but where's she going? That's true.  Because you were out there, yeah. I'm looking.  But if you don't have somebody, you can let the  girl pick him. And she didn't have a license,  so where was she? I know, where's she going?  At the bus stop, she was going to buy someone for you?  Exactly, exactly.  Sitting at home, what, the garbage men are going to come 
[02:09:30]  around and fucking... So would you actually  say, like, we can do this, and then try to get  her pregnant? Because once you get her pregnant, you couldn't do that  anymore. Boy, no, that didn't work.  She wanted to have a baby.  Thank God.  Thank you, God,  for never fucking letting that  spermatozoa penetrate that  egg. Yeah. Oh, did  she want a baby? Went to fertility  clinics to check out, you know, if everything  was up to snuff. And meanwhile, you were  faking the orgasms? I had to beat off into a  thing. Yeah, so I started fake coming 
[02:10:00]  in her. I would go like,  really?  And then I'd be like, yeah, I'll be right  back, go to the bathroom, crank it  out into the fucking toilet,  which was one step above, I guess.  Fuck that shit.  But she was going to fertility clinics  thinking there was something wrong with her, but meanwhile, you weren't  coming inside of her. I wasn't shooting loads  in her at all. You were jerking off in a toilet.  Yes, I was. I would fucking  make believe I would do all the goofy faces  and the little twitches and all that 
[02:10:30]  shit. And I wouldn't even care. It's like  if she was like, wow, there's no cum coming out of  them or something, you know.  It's hock-a-loogie down there. Yeah, it must  have went in pretty deep there. It's probably in there  festering in your womb. That's sexy talk.  Fertilizing those eggs. Yeah.  It's in there strangling your eggs.  And there it is, fucking clockwise  spinning down the turdy.  Exactly. Your legacy.  Yeah. She didn't ask why there was nothing  dribbling out of her? No, you know what?  She never asked. I guess she didn't want to  you know, because we went to the fertility clinic 
[02:11:00]  and I was fine. So  she was probably like, you know, well  if he wasn't shooting a load or it was  bad or something like that, it would have come up  in the fertility clinic. And she certainly wasn't  thinking I wasn't fucking shooting loads.  Was she ever drunk  when you were having sex?  Was she  not? So maybe that, yeah, she was drunk  she didn't notice. Yeah, maybe that's it.  Keep your legs back. You gotta tell her, keep your legs back so it  goes in there. Yes. Deep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Grab your ankles and hold  on to that for two or three hours. Yeah, hold that lovely 
[02:11:30]  batch. Hold it in there.  Hold my life-giving seed in your fucking  womb. Please. So she knew your sperm was  good. Oh, yeah.  So then you would, and you would just faking it. Numbers, it was all there.  Yeah. Yeah. But I was  faking coming.  That's why the threesome thing was so good.  Oh, loads like a sprinkler  head. Finally.  Finally, I could let it go without  looking at the fucking, the Kohler  toilet. A little  flush handle. Now we allowed to- I fell in love with  the flush handle. Were you allowed to come in the other 
[02:12:00]  girls, in the threesomes? Was that  against the rules? A loud, a schmoud.  I was doing whatever the fuck I did.  Wait, did you ever blow a load in the other girl during the  threesome? Yeah.  She was on the pill.  She was on the pill.  It was great. But were you  faking it with her or was it real?  Was it real? It was the realest,  most wonderful orgasms.  See, now I think your wife would probably get mad at that. She's like,  at least finish with me. I brought this girl  home. I'm giving you a treat.  Can you at least finish with me, not with her? 
[02:12:30]  I'd be like, whoops. That was a little  premature. An hour and a half  later. How did she handle  that, though?  Is she alright with it?  Look, I got yelled at for everything.  So I didn't care. Like, if she  got mad at that, why would I care? She got mad at me  for not taking out the garbage. Was she ever  objecting because you were blowing loads in the other girl?  No, you know what?  She never objected to that. That's cool.  Yeah. I don't think she noticed, though.  I didn't do the whole, like, oh my god!  Oh, this is fantastic! 
[02:13:00]  I do kind of the subdued, you know.  Mmm.  Mmm. Mmm.  You know, just grunting.  And she was drunk as it was.  Yeah. So, you know, what the fuck?  Do you think this is a turn-off for a girl that, when I'm coming inside of her, I just  keep repeating, holy moly?  Holy moly!  Those are some wild times there, young Sam Roberts. I don't recommend you do this with the lovely  Mrs. Roberts, because it is a marriage destroyer.  He's got a grin on his face, like they've talked about it.  I know. He's looking like, oh. 
[02:13:30]  She's talked to him. Jess is probably talked to him.  And, boy, you're in the radio biz. You know, you get a little notoriety under your belt  like that, the chicks will be coming on to you, no matter how ghastly you look.  But that's about me.  Well, nothing.  Okay.  You could figure it out.  Right.  But, uh, and then the temptation's there, and then you're out with your girl, and a  girl comes up and is like, oh, why don't we do this? Those fucking wedding vows we  watched you fucking recite? Right out the fucking window.  But Florentine's right. That's not something that I could approach her with. 
[02:14:00]  She would have to approach me.  Yes.  And this new, younger generation, they're way into it. I mean, 20 years ago, that was  tough. That was rare that a chick would want to have a threesome.  Exactly.  That was pornography.  That was maybe like one out of 50. Now it's like one out of every five. So Sam's right in  his prime.  You're in your prime right now.  Where are you getting your stats, sir?  I'm just, you know, in general, how many girls were in a threesome when you were young  20 years ago that wanted those?  It was just shit you heard about.  I was trying to find a four-leaf clover. 
[02:14:30]  It was shit you heard about.  Right.  It never really happened.  And it was always like two guys.  From a faraway land.  It was always two guys and one girl.  It was never like two chicks and one guy.  Right.  Yeah.  And that wasn't going to happen.  Nah.  Would you have gotten jealous if there was another guy there?  It would never happen.  Why not?  You either put your pussy while the guy fucks your ass?  You're two worst nightmares.  Fucking liquor roids while you're fucking...  You just shaved it, too.  It was all stubbly.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Stubbly.  Yeah.  Nah, that would never happen.  No, but I mean, she brought a girl home, so the least you could do is...  Bring one of the guys from the job site home?  Yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Would you have gotten jealous?  Honey, I brought home a roofer.  Would you have got jealous or just because there was another guy in a room would have weirded  you out?  Too weird.  I could never fucking function.  Wait, would it have turned you off if you were laying there next to them and he was fucking  your wife and putting his fingers in your mouth and making you suck his fingers?  Just ruin an hour of radio. 
[02:15:30]  Calloused hands.  You had just big man hammer hands, you're like sucking his thumb like a little baby.  That ain't gonna happen.  You could feel the calluses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just dirty, dirty nails.  Well, there goes that discussion.  Right?  Florentine, what are we promoting today, buddy?  What are we?  The metal show, the Californication, the podcast.  What do you got?  Sunday, May 11th, Californication, and then May 15th in Louisville at the Comedy Caravan.  That's where everyone's a redhead. 
[02:16:00]  Laugh and Derby Comedy Caravan, May 15th.  Right.  And then May 30, 31, Laugh and Comedy Cafe in Fort Myers and Improv in Fort Lauderdale June  4th.  All right.  We got a really hot story after the break.  Really hot.  Hotter than...  Way hotter.  Former New York City...  Than the fingers in Anthony's mouth.  Let me read the headline and you decide.  We're going to talk about this.  Former New York City transit exec makes graphic claims that boss sexually harassed him.  Weird dude.  With his Mount Everest penis.  Nice.  Ah, Mount Everest penis. 
[02:16:30]  Yes, we got that.  And Tammy Pescatelli joining us next.  Ain't it, ain't it.  Oh, I see.  I got a nice seat in there.  Tammy Pescatelli joining the show.  And, uh...  Yes.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I just don't want to lose this one phone call.  Hold on one second.  We got Ryan in Red Bank.  We were talking about threesomes.  And Ryan's got a quick story.  Go ahead, Ryan.  Well, it's just in time for me.  That's right.  And I saved the sexiest story of the day for you. 
[02:17:00]  It's coming home.  Oh, Ryan just hung up.  Ah, you lost him.  He holds through the whole break.  Why would you hold through the break?  And then the second we go live, you hang up.  I guess they brought a girl home for a threesome and she had an allergic reaction to something.  And they had to, like, get her to a while.  Probably the real hypnose.  I hope he at least put it in for a second.  Yeah.  When she passed out, you have to.  Yeah.  They used to call it free meat, I think, in college.  I don't know, but it was a great scene in Animal House.  And now you couldn't even do it.  Right.  Right?  Remember that? 
[02:17:30]  That was one of the best scenes ever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When she passed out on the bed.  And he reaches up and then all the tissue comes out.  Because rape is just hilarious in movies.  It is sometimes.  Stop.  Let's not be crazy.  Back in what they called the day, it was like passing out and having sex with the passed  out girl was just a comedy thing.  It wasn't rape.  As a woman, you were supposed to go, I am never going to get that fucked up again.  Right.  To let that happen.  It was supposed to be a lesson for you.  That's right.  Animal House was education.  You know what I mean?  That's how it was for all of us. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I think, you know?  And now they're just.  And then you can't say anything about them.  Oh, don't horse shame me.  Yeah.  That's the big thing now because they're saying they're horse shaming that guy.  Well, Kruger didn't fuck her, though.  No.  He didn't fuck her.  Pinto did not fuck her in the end.  Well, because she was 12, right?  Wasn't she turned out?  Thank God.  She was 13.  I was hoping that was going to be in the extras, like the 25th anniversary edition.  They shot that, but it didn't make it.  It didn't test well.  He fucked her on the football field, though.  But you know there's a discussion where they're like, we've got to make her 13. 
[02:18:30]  12 is sick.  12 is too young.  12 is sick.  13.  It's a teen.  We can get away with that.  You know, I'm just starting to realize something about that movie.  When she was drunk and passed out in the bed, he didn't have sex with her.  Right.  But then on the football field, he did have sex with her.  But when he came to the window and he said, hey, I thought maybe we could get some beers  and hang out.  And she goes, nah.  She goes, no, not tonight.  She goes, besides, you might get lucky without it.  Like, did they put that in there to say, like, look, she totally wasn't drunk when he did 
[02:19:00]  fuck her and he didn't fuck her when she was drunk?  Yeah, probably.  Maybe to soften it up.  Got a lot of catching up to do.  Right.  I've got to go back and watch it.  That was great.  Like the perv that I am.  That was probably the reasoning in their heads.  That was.  I think we could get away with this.  If she's sober.  If she's totally sober.  They called Roman Polanski.  Yeah.  Yeah, Roman, how would you handle this situation?  What do you think?  He's got a special consultant credit.  But you could not do that scene nowadays.  The rape consultant.  Right. 
[02:19:30]  Imagine trying that scene.  No.  It would not hold.  It wouldn't fly.  There's a lot of movies that just wouldn't wash these days.  Hey, Tammy, we were talking about threesomes before.  Now, Anthony would have them with his ex-wife.  Yeah.  If you were bringing another girl in the bedroom,  would you let your husband have sex with her in front of you?  Would it be cool?  Yeah, get to sleep an extra four and a half minutes.  That would be wonderful.  Is he allowed to have sex with her when you're in the shower or you're sleeping?  If we're already there, we might as well just go all the way.  That was my logic.  I don't think you can go halfway on a threesome. 
[02:20:00]  The second you put rules.  That's a one and a half.  The second you put rules on it, it's like you're putting rules to anarchy.  It doesn't work.  Once you give the word that we're going to have a threesome,  all those marriage vows, the love you and no one else, it's done.  Yeah, and then what happens is this is what I've seen.  And, you know, I mean, maybe I'm around a lot of degenerates.  So, granted, let me put my ass up with this.  At this very moment.  But usually threesomes, they're all cool and fun.  You go, oh, my wife lets me bring chicks home. 
[02:20:30]  Then pretty soon the dude is banging other broads.  And then she hates him because, oh, he fucked this one.  I wasn't there.  No, you're just upset.  I called it a threesome with you in absentia.  It's still a threesome.  By proxy.  Yes, by proxy with an absentee ballad.  You know, there's plenty of ways to have a threesome without her there.  You were there in my mind.  I was thinking of you.  But his wife said, don't fuck the girl when I'm not around. 
[02:21:00]  And he still did.  Now, is that breaking a rule?  Like, if that happened with you, if you told your husband, look, don't fuck her while I'm not here.  Just do me that.  I have to be in the room when it goes down.  That's fair, right?  I mean, I guess it's fair.  But the truth is, I just don't.  I think those are slippery slopes.  You have to.  I don't even know why bother to get married.  Like, every fantasy that I ever had when I was single has now come across my path that I'm married.  And it's such a shame, you know?  When I was single, I'd get a massage and the balls would just bang on the top of your head and you'd be disgusted by it. 
[02:21:30]  That's what they do.  They bang their balls on you.  They just bang the balls.  And then it's like you're laying on your face and your hands are behind you and their balls just like in the cup.  Oh, really?  And then now you get married and it all comes across your path and you just have to.  And you get no credit for what you don't do.  There's no bonus points for what you're not doing.  You're supposed to not do it.  I could have fucked this guy.  Right.  You're supposed to not do it.  It's like give me credit.  This is hard.  Did you ever like clap your hand a little when the guy had his balls? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, they were never worth.  They were never cup worthy.  No.  What if it was a really good looking guy, you think you might have just curled it up a little?  I don't fantasize about Asian men.  Oh, boy.  That is one category that is not on you point right there.  You're alone in this room.  That is not.  Exactly.  Nothing wrong with a Filipino, you know, so androgynous in the back.  I can't even look at you, Jimmy, with hair.  It's so cool.  Isn't it weird?  Weird, right?  Yeah.  He came walking in this morning.  He passed by the window.  You had the sunglasses on and the spike hair. 
[02:22:30]  You look badass.  Like a baby hawk.  You're like a baby hawk.  It was so cute.  It was so cute.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Very funny.  I got a gift from Scott Shannon.  I want to thank you.  Scott Shannon?  Scott said to me this.  What the fuck?  Where's our gifts?  Jim, I call this shot First Kiss.  First known shot of the band in uniform.  Get the fuck out of here.  Thanks for being funny.  Scott.  So he had this picture of Kiss.  Wow.  Black and white photo of Kiss.  Get out.  That's like their first picture in makeup and costume. 
[02:23:00]  It's real, real old school.  What an amazing photo.  So thank you to Scott Shannon.  That is gorgeous.  Very cool.  All nice and framed.  What a class fucking act that Scott Shannon is.  Right.  He's a class guy.  Tell him I like Sabbath.  Just say Team Scott in your head.  You've got to be Team Scott.  There's a big radio war going on.  And we're Team Scott.  And Gordon.  Wow, do I love that.  Thank you very much.  I find the Kiss movie.  I was trying to find that the other day.  Oh, that crazy one at Central Park?  And they were on a roller coaster and stuff.  Oh, Jimmy loves that one. 
[02:23:30]  He knows everything about it.  Kiss meets the Phantom of the Park.  Yeah.  Oh, the Phantom of the Park.  And the best part is when Gene tries to walk through that kiosk thing.  That little thing.  And he can't get through it.  He trips a little bit.  And they were on a plane.  Now you could never get all that on a plane.  Could you imagine if they'd walk in full gear on a plane somewhere?  Yeah, yeah.  They'd be wrestled to the ground and cuffed.  Well, Paul told a story actually in a Scott Shannon interview, which I just heard.  That when he landed in Japan, I think they had to take the makeup off. 
[02:24:00]  Because the Japanese guys were like, the customers were like, we don't know who you are.  They came in makeup and there was thousands of people waiting.  Don't they all look like that, though?  Like kabuki makeup or something like that?  I think they do.  They were trying to take them over to the white paddy.  They had to go and take the makeup off and put it back on real quick and go out and see the fans.  Wow.  Well, they were traveling in their kiss makeup?  Yeah, they had to.  They were landing in the fans.  It's so greasy.  Oh, that's so fucking weird.  Yeah.  You know how many pillows got smeared with all that?  Oh, man.  Imagine that one, Jimmy.  Imagine getting a kiss makeup smeared pillow from the airplane. 
[02:24:30]  Girls walking out with half of it on their face like one of those dolls.  Those masks.  The tragedy comedy masks.  Yes, exactly.  You see Ace Frehley's fucking face on some girl's crotch.  There's probably a lot.  In reverse.  I thought the star was on the other side.  There's probably a lot of Paul Stanley smeared pillows.  Oh, I bet that.  That voice, it did turn me off the first time I heard it.  Yeah, I got thrown off just a bit.  What happened?  I got thrown off just a bit the first time. 
[02:25:00]  I loved Paul's.  Yeah.  Lots of things turned me off.  I went to a rat concert.  You'll like this, Jimmy.  I went to a rat concert.  Yeah, a bunch of mop snitches.  Oh, shit.  That was Jim.  Yes, that's it.  Jim Chipperson.  That's my family reunion.  I was there, and we went, of course, we're young girls, and I had a friend that was real  hot, and she would flash her tits everywhere, so we used to get backstage, and I saw Steven  Piercy trip up the steps, and I left, because I was like, all the cool is gone. 
[02:25:30]  Once that veneer has been split.  Yeah, yeah.  Now he's not very cool either, but...  He just left right.  He just officially left right again.  What?  What?  Yes, now?  Just the chest.  Yeah, he left the band.  Should have left 20 years ago.  No, they were together.  They were apart and together, and he just officially left them.  They're still doing new songs and stuff?  They put an album out like three years ago.  It was actually pretty good.  You're the only one who knows that.  Well, he has to for the show.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I had no idea that they were still trying to do it.  That's cool.  No, they were good. 
[02:26:00]  They were good at that time, right?  They had two songs.  Not a lot of heads, though.  Round and round.  Then round and round, and then another one about up and down or something, I think.  Well, he dated, remember, he dated Tawny Katane, and she was on the cover of the album.  Do you remember that?  Really?  He dated her before the guy from Whitesnake.  No, it's her legs on the cover of the Rat album.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I've got worthless knowledge.  Look at you at this trivia.  I have a think tank of nothing.  There's nothing going on in there.  By the way, it wasn't a friend that was showing her tits, okay?  Come on.  No, it wasn't me.  Oh, it was a friend of mine. 
[02:26:30]  I was too afraid, Ben.  Yeah?  He was flashing a rat conscience.  Now it's too late.  No one wants to see him.  Piercy would.  Tawny was just far beyond showing.  She was bent over, like, two fingers in the anus.  I had a camel toe on purpose.  And a skirt.  A skirt camel toe.  A skirt camel toe.  That's impressive.  So you guys would get backstage because she flashed her tits?  She would flash her tits.  Oh, man.  So then the roadies would come out and get you guys.  Damn, that really happens, right?  Yeah.  The roadies would actually know. 
[02:27:00]  Did you guys have to blow the roadies to get further backstage?  I never did any of that.  I mean, I would tell you, too.  Oh, man.  You know why?  Because I was always the person that, in your head, it sounds like a great idea.  But then you get back and I just start talking to myself.  I was always this person, but younger.  So, like, it just never worked out.  You know, you think it's a great idea.  And then you get back and you see they're ugly.  And then you go, I would never.  You were in the band.  Like, you know.  Some girls just love the fact that they're backstage with the band.  Yeah.  But no, I mean, they were in, like, the marching band.  And then just happened to get a break. 
[02:27:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, it was, you're just one feather and some boats away from the football field.  That fucking roadie gauntlet.  It's like a double dare fucking physical challenge.  You know, it was amazing back in the day that you had to fuck the roadies to get to the band.  Like, these girls would actually fuck these smelly guys that haven't showered in three days.  Just work 16 hours.  Yeah.  And then they get to fuck the band.  And the band didn't even care.  Like, you didn't care that that sleazy roadie was just inside of her.  No.  Brett Michaels or somebody said they had a color code for the passes. 
[02:28:00]  Motley Crue had the two smiley passes.  And then one, remember when they did the theater?  Wow, you know all about backstage.  Like, it's a roadie.  For someone that was cringed.  I went back.  For someone that was creeped out.  Any of them.  And I would tell you.  She knows all the variations of the backstage pass.  What was the color code for Motley Crue?  What was the color code for?  It was Two Faces Up, I think it was.  What did that mean?  That was that she had done the roadie.  Okay.  Wow.  I read that in their book.  So now who takes that one?  Yeah.  The drummer.  Well, no, Vince.  Mick, because he can't move at all. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Well, maybe that's just the one that sucks your dick or eats your ass.  You don't kiss that one.  Right.  Who knows?  You might let it blow you anyway.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Yeah, why take sloppy seconds from your roadie?  Right.  That's fucked.  Well, maybe they don't have to give them bonuses at Christmas.  Maybe they weren't fucking them.  Maybe they were just getting blowjobs.  But even still, you know, they'd fucking get some mouthwash.  They look like the penguin with long hair.  They're just all disgusting, chest of apple pie looking.  Disgusting.  I was at a Scorpion show one time and I met this chick and I brought her all the way to 
[02:29:00]  the front row and she was flashing the band the whole time.  And she left it.  And I'm making out with this girl.  I'm like, this is awesome.  And the band's going, yeah.  Like, giving the thumbs up on the stage.  I'm grabbing her tits.  I'm like, this is great, too.  And then all of a sudden the roadie comes and goes, hey, the Scorpions want you guys  to come backstage.  I'm like, holy shit.  I'm going to meet the Scorpions.  This is great.  We got right to the door.  She goes first.  A big black guy who stands right in the way goes, nope, you can't go.  I go, no, I said I can't.  Oh, my God.  You can't.  I'm telling the girl, I go, oh, Melissa, Melissa.  She didn't even look back.  Oh, my God.  Didn't even look back at me. 
[02:29:30]  I had a long walk back to my fucking car.  I was the only car in the parking lot left at fucking one in the morning in Philly and  walked back there by myself.  Oh, she's getting fucked.  Didn't even look as I yelled her name.  Oh, man.  You don't think she wanted you to come back with her?  She didn't even acknowledge me.  I got her in the front row, hung out with her, got her beers.  She'll give you that little heart sign.  No, I didn't even get her number.  Cheesy, did you want to punch him in the face?  Nothing, I'm sorry.  I'm just going to get an autograph from my brother. 
[02:30:00]  That would have been nice.  You should have at least got a picture before they kicked you out.  Wow.  What the fuck?  You guys don't have that equivalent that women have.  But I don't blame them.  I would have been the same way.  What do I want this dork backstage for?  Oh, that's true.  You got the band right there.  Yeah, they're like, I don't want to meet this guy.  Never go to the Hawaiian traffic bikini show and they're like, hey, you, come back.  Yeah, yeah, that never happens.  You know?  Yeah, get that guy.  I was mad at the Scorpions for like 10 years.  I was.  I didn't buy their latest three records.  I'm like, fuck those guys, man. 
[02:30:30]  What brought you back in, though?  Wind of change?  I woke up on, yeah, the whistling.  The whistling got me back.  I pulled you back in.  Finally.  Fucking bitch.  That's funny.  I woke up one day and I go, I would have done the same thing.  As soon as I started being a comic, I would have done the same thing.  Yeah.  I don't want any guys backstage.  That's funny.  That's a great story, Jim.  Jesus.  Didn't even look back.  Tammy, what are you promoting there?  I'm doing Dirty, Sexy, Funny with Jenny McCarthy.  All right.  Oh.  Which is a weird thing for me because, you know, I never really tried to like do chick stuff. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  But it's not, it's fun.  But you're funnier than Jenny McCarthy, so how does that work out?  She's not trying to be a comic.  She said straight up.  So she just hosts a show?  She just hosts a show.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  She does a lot.  You know what's really cool is, I mean, and this is like, I'll probably get in a lot of  trouble, but I don't really give a shit.  The truth is, is that a lot of female comics have broke through, but they never reached back  and like picked up any women.  I've been trying for 20 years.  I would have got on one of their shows, you know, and nobody ever said, they all kind  of just did it for the, Chelsea Handler picks up people and takes them on tour, but it's 
[02:31:30]  not just women, it's guys too.  So there was never, like when I was coming up, some of these women were huge and maybe  would have, you know, it would have been cool to, I'm just getting ready for the dismount  fellas.  I just can't do, I got 10 more years.  That's it.  That's it.  I can't do a late show Friday at a Funny Bone somewhere.  Right.  10.  10.  10.  I got to fight with a 22 year old kid who's drunk and I,  I, I got, this is a little too much.  I'm preparing.  This is it.  Yeah.  It's the Keswick Theater. 
[02:32:00]  Where's that?  That's tonight.  It's in Philadelphia.  Okay.  We're kicking off.  It's a really fun.  And then you're playing in my hometown, Huntington, at a great theater, the Paramount.  I know.  That's tomorrow night.  I have a restaurant there.  Go to FH Riley's.  I want to go.  He might give you a thing or two.  That'll come.  That's what I do.  I go city to city to get free food.  Free food.  Free eats.  The Paramount, though, is really a nice venue.  Wow.  They do a good job there in Huntington.  The girls are funny, too.  And she's hilarious.  Paula Bell is crazy.  She's out of LA.  She's just crazy. 
[02:32:30]  Isn't she Boston originally?  Maybe.  I thought she was a Boston.  I haven't seen her in years.  That makes sense.  Because she has that mentality.  She just doesn't take shit.  And who else is on?  That flips back and forth.  But tonight is a girl named Justin Marino.  Okay.  Justine Marino.  A girl named Justin.  Right.  But it's funny.  We did a special on Epix already.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I love those guys.  Yeah.  They did right by you.  Yeah.  I've done two of them.  They're really, really good.  We got a hot story. 
[02:33:00]  Uh-oh.  Former New York City Transit exec makes graphic claims that boss sexually harassed him.  That's two guys in the story, by the way.  I was going to say.  A New York City Transit employee alleges he was fired after fighting off the increasingly  creepy come-ons of his horny boss who bragged of a Mount Everest-sized manhood.  That's why I'm suing Opie and Anthony.  Wouldn't that mean a thin fucking helmet?  Yeah.  Very skinny helmet.  Very thick base.  That would be awful, right?  The oxygen is long when you get there.  Yes.  No oxygen.  That would be awful to have, right? 
[02:33:30]  It kills a bunch of people every year.  People are stuck on it and they're never found.  Yes.  Terrible.  Hector, in a graphically detailed Manhattan lawsuit, said a supervisor masturbated in his  presence.  But why don't you leave?  I mean, like...  Right.  You're sucking.  Get out of here.  Maybe I jerk off.  I just don't feel like guys can be sexually harassed.  I really don't.  If that happened, you would just start laughing.  Like, what the fuck's wrong with you?  But even as a girl, you just start...  You know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly.  I think it's a girl's thing, the sexual harassment. 
[02:34:00]  I can't see a situation where a guy is sexually harassed.  I just can't see it.  Well, if the boss whips out his mule and he starts jerking off, it might be...  So far, if he's just masturbating in his presence, you're just like, what are you doing?  Yeah, I live with Jim.  Jim did it before in my presence.  But maybe that was okay.  I didn't sue him.  Is this sexual harassment?  Then he grabbed his buttocks and massaged his neck and back.  Sounds nice.  Wait a second.  Massaged his back.  Massage.  After he grabbed his butt.  Hey, before or during the masturbation. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I think the masturbation was first, and then he went with the buttocks grab.  Did he bang his balls against his head while he was getting the massage?  During one shocking May meeting, Frederick Lynch began touching and talking to his penis,  according to the court papers.  Talking to his penis?  You should be hidden beneath my pants.  This is an episode of The Honeymooners I never saw.  Yeah.  It's not...  This is your cave.  Your cave.  Your cave.  It's crazy.  Prowl, 71 of Queens. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, an older guy, too.  Said the relentless sexual harassment by Lynch began in January and continued until December.  He left this for almost a year.  Wait, so this guy was 71 that was whipping his dick out?  No, the guy that was being sexually harassed was 71.  Wait, who's pulling out their dick to a 71-year-old guy?  Come on.  Don't be ageist.  It escalated over to 11 months.  Donald Sterling's wife.  11 months?  You're dealing with this?  Sorry.  11 months.  She looks like she's got one. 
[02:35:30]  Prowl said he was on the job just three days when he summoned to Lynch's office.  Wow.  To review a transit project.  During the meeting, Lynch sat with a zipper open and began sliding his right hand on top  of his pants in a jerking gesture and giving himself an erection.  Justice.  But who doesn't go?  Who needs the job that bad me?  What the fuck are you doing?  I mean, I don't know that people get so quiet, they don't know what to say.  How old is the guy that's doing this?  If he's the 71-year-old that's getting harassed, I don't see an age on the other guy.  Let's just know that neither one of them are hot at all. 
[02:36:00]  There's nothing attractive.  But can it be a 40-year-old boss, like, wanting to do that to a 71-year-old man?  Yeah.  On more than a dozen occasions, Lynch allegedly invited Prowse.  But who hires a 71-year-old, too, by the way?  When is retirement?  You're right.  What the fuck?  On an all-expenses-paid vacation, shook his butt in front of him, grabbed his butt, and  forced his hand into his crotch.  Wait a second.  Stop right there.  Because he said, this is like that guy who went to Hawaii with the producers and stuff.  Remember? 
[02:36:30]  Merditch just was out.  He was 14.  He's in Hawaii.  He's suing the director of Hawaii.  So he's on an all-expense-paid vacation?  I think if you go on an all-expense-paid vacation, you've got to let him grab your butt a little  bit, right, Jim?  Yeah, you know the price of admission to ride the ride.  Right.  I mean, those are deals that people make.  You're getting a free vacation.  You've got to get up a little something.  Who goes on vacation with their boss?  And if you're going to, like, all right, look, we're obviously...  He's paying.  You'd do a little something.  You might jerk him off a little bit.  To me, and I know people get pissed, but that's what I thought with this whole Donald Sterling  thing, set aside all the race shit. 
[02:37:00]  He literally has paid for this broad.  He was saying, do what you want to do.  Don't make me look like a dick in public.  There you go.  Right?  You're a racist.  No, yeah.  That's that you are.  You have to apologize.  Magic Johnson was his mortal enemy.  That's like if Batman's girl took a picture with the Joker.  He fucking hates Magic Johnson.  He would have to go to that stadium all the time.  He'd have to go over to the forum.  He'd have to go over there.  It's purple and gold everywhere.  Magic got AIDS and still didn't die. 
[02:37:30]  Donald Sterling hates Magic Johnson.  Yeah.  But there's, you know, and there's a conspiracy going around that, you know, Magic was...  Don't do it.  What?  That he wants to buy the team?  Well, Magic wants to buy the...  No, but there's a conspiracy that he was...  Right.  He kind of, like, told this chick because he knew the girl for a while, for a long time.  Like, hey, you know, I hate this guy.  So whether he said it to her or she just did it on her own, going,  we'll get him out.  Everybody loves Magic.  The NBA does.  Magic are by the Clippers.  I'm not saying that this girl like that is a racist. 
[02:38:00]  She's getting scared because she's saying that someone took her audio recordings  and pushed them out there.  Yeah, sure.  Now she's going with that angle.  Yeah.  Because the first angle wasn't good enough where she said he knew he was being recorded,  which is bullshit.  Now she's saying, I forgot the exact statement.  Well, and then she was also posting stuff on Instagram.  Like, the truth is coming out, like, a week before.  Right.  Simon Schuster.  You know, like, she was going to write a book.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And Sterling is going to wage a fierce fight, according to attorneys.  He's not just going to walk away from this. 
[02:38:30]  Well, it's a slippery slope for people like us.  A slippery slope.  I mean, seriously.  Oh, my God, man.  At the end of the day.  It's so funny.  But really, seriously, like, if they're going to start getting people for what they say at  their house, we're in trouble.  I mean, we stand out and say stuff all the time.  All the time.  Nobody could be recorded without their knowledge and then be okay with it being broadcast out  there.  Everyone would be in trouble.  Yeah.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Anyway, back to this. 
[02:39:00]  He claimed that Mr. Prowse, who was sexually harassed, had beautiful hands like a pianist,  the lawsuit charged.  Oh.  Yes.  Prowse later began screaming when Lynch came to his cubicle in November 2013.  Like a hand model.  And began massaging and squeezing his neck, body, and back.  He's 71.  I mean, you know, he's going to have some aches.  So his fucking boss is phenomenal.  Yeah, I know.  Just making sure he's having a good day.  Give him a vacation.  So you don't like it, the lawsuit quoted Lynch is asking.  I have told you dozens of times, do not touch me. 
[02:39:30]  You're the most indelicate person I had ever met in all my years at work.  I do not need any massages from you.  When are you going to get it?  Could you just go back and masturbate him for me?  One month later, Lynch called Prowse into his office.  Oh.  Wow.  And things quickly turned even weirder.  Weird news.  Weird news.  We should reenact this whole thing.  Yeah.  Mr. Lynch spun me around and grabbed his penis like he was masturbating.  It's like a romance novel, this thing. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  It reads very sexy.  Mr. Lynch obviously had an erection and claimed this augmentation was like the Everest mountains.  Is there a gay penthouse letters?  Because that's what this really is.  Yeah, that's what it is.  There you go.  Penthouse Forum.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, yeah.  There I was.  Do you think someone like that's going to be that aggressive at work over and over again  for over a year?  Well, first of all, the other guy thought they were having an affair.  Yeah.  The other guy must have turned them on.  The 71-year-old had to be doing something.  Absolutely.  Why would your boss keep coming on to you like that over and over again? 
[02:40:30]  But he had to think it was okay.  Cock teased.  Right?  He had to think it was okay.  Yeah, maybe he had just like his diaper up in like a G-string.  He saw him at the urinal.  He had his pants down.  That's hot.  Do you like a good diaper joke?  Oh, yeah.  Always.  Always.  Love it.  This guy's been waiting an hour just to talk to Jim Florentine.  I wanted to make it officially an hour before I took his phone call.  And he drunk.  Who's this?  Somebody in Dallas.  Craig, it looks like.  Craig? 
[02:41:00]  Lee Harvey.  Hello?  You're waiting an hour.  You there?  What's up?  No?  Okay.  No?  Wow, what's going on around here?  Yellow.  All right.  He waited an hour.  He loves you, Florentine.  Huge fan from Dallas.  He loves you.  But he's not there anymore.  What an asshole.  Yeah.  Loved Dallas.  All right.  Yeah.  Everywhere I went, like on Twitter, people kept going, are you sure you're really booked  this morning?  Are you sure you're really booked this morning?  You didn't get fake Roland tweeting you, huh?  I've been trying to figure that one out.  That was the best one.  Fake Roland. 
[02:41:30]  There was an account that looked just like Roland's Twitter account.  Right.  And he booked one of our friends, Mike Baker.  And Mike was like, all right, I'll come in.  And he came in the other day.  And we're like, why is Mike Baker here?  And it's like, oh, fuck.  And then Sam starts laughing.  And he goes, let me look.  I think I know why.  And he looked at fake Roland's Twitter feed.  And him and Mike going back and forth.  Yeah, come in.  Really?  Come in.  Yeah.  But he said, like, come in Tuesday through Friday. 
[02:42:00]  Anthony wants you to come in and say the same three things you say every time you're in.  Every time you're in.  And Mike goes, okay, I'm in.  This guy's CIA.  He goes, I'll block you from Tuesday to Friday.  You'll be in.  Yeah, you'll be in.  Yeah.  And then he showed up.  And we're like, uh-oh, why is Mike here?  And, of course, Sam just loves shit like that.  Sam, I said, it's probably Sam.  It's probably Sam.  Oh, God.  Which is just great.  He was mortified.  He was trying to be cool about it.  But you could tell.  Bro, this CIA guy.  Absolutely.  He can't be tricked like that.  Yeah, he was a little embarrassed. 
[02:42:30]  He's not happy.  He's not getting tricked on Twitter.  He's actually following Osama bin Luton because we didn't think it was him.  It was a different guy.  Yeah, he's a different guy.  He's not happy.  This guy thinks Jimmy was wrong about the Clippers yesterday.  Uh-oh.  Here, dude.  Nothing has changed in this.  Daniel.  How, Daniel?  What's up, boys?  Hi.  Just get to it.  I just want to.  It's fucking Friday.  Just get to it.  Just get to it.  Everyone has to have their opener.  Hey, boys.  I like to open strong on my phone call. 
[02:43:00]  Happy birthday.  It's a dynamic type of a phone call.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  Get him to warm him up.  Right.  Let's go.  I wanted to let little Jimmy know about the whole contract thing that he was talking about  yesterday about they're obligated to play.  Technically, they're really not.  The only time you ever really see that is in the football where if you have an injury-prone  player, their contract will be built around their injuries and stuff like that.  Now, with the NBA, you don't really have any contract towards that, so it doesn't really 
[02:43:30]  matter.  No, but they're obligated to play.  They can't take off because their feelings are hurt.  Right.  Well, it doesn't matter.  It definitely hurts.  Quite frankly, they don't care what the NBA has said at this point.  Donald Sterling still owns the fucking team, and they don't want to piss Donald Sterling  off.  He hurt me with his words.  So, all these players are being very careful how they're talking about this, because he  truly still owns the fucking team.  Yeah, but you can fake an injury or whatnot in it.  Oh, okay.  Isn't it great that that Jerky Boys bit has become what really happens now? 
[02:44:00]  Exactly.  It's like, were you injured?  Yes, very injured.  Well, what did he hurt?  His words hurt me.  It's like, now that's real.  It's fucking real.  It's also a playoff game.  They're not going to sit out a playoff game.  They just played the whole season to get in the playoffs.  Yeah, if it was game four of the season, maybe they would have.  But they couldn't come up with a better protest than just leaving it for the Mexican bull  belly to pick up their things.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  That was horrible.  Just make a pile.  You didn't think it was dramatic when they did that? 
[02:44:30]  I thought it was terrific.  Oh, yeah.  I was waiting for the warm-up jersey and set a court.  It was so dramatic.  And then the guy just comes over and cleans it up.  That's it.  Clean it up.  And then the black socks, that was a good touch, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, very dramatic.  Burned him an effigy or something or, you know, all gave the finger to the camera.  I would have loved to see him just not play the game.  Pulled their fists up.  That would have been the ballsy move.  Yeah.  And they're not going to win the championship, so why not?  Off topic about socks.  Yeah.  Have you ever gone and put your socks on and you get it so screwed up where there's no 
[02:45:00]  twisting the heel or the toe so bad where you have to completely abort the sock put on  and take it off and start over again?  Is that lump for the fucking ankle or the heel on the side?  Especially if you, like, just showered.  So it's kind of, and you try pulling the heel and the toe around, it's like, I just got  to take the sock, abort.  Completely abort.  I've had that with pantyhose.  You roll them all the way up and the tuck isn't good.  Wait, I have a feeling that sock bit is a Seinfeld. 
[02:45:30]  No, no, it happened to me this morning, I swear.  I swear.  I love the fact that everything I say now, people think is a Seinfeld reference.  See, that's half the joy.  That happened to me with a pink sock one time.  I had to redo it.  What about a wet sock?  That's the worst, too, when you're walking in your pocket.  The worst.  Terrible.  I've ripped the top off of my socks plenty of times, but you have a wet, and you're, like,  in a hurry so you don't drop it off, and the top just rips, and you're like, fuck.  What about when you go back in the bathroom when you have your socks on?  And step in that fucking lamp. 
[02:46:00]  Let's talk about that for a while.  How about why is the bathroom floor better put on can-to-win socks?  Yeah.  At a hotel when they don't take that extra five minutes,  to let the sheets completely dry, and then they make the bed with a wet sheet?  I've never got that.  Really?  Yeah, it's happened.  I like a tuck.  If you walk into a peep booth in socks.  Yes, Jimmy.  It's the worst.  I've seen you do that.  You like Hans Christian Andersen skating?  I realize.  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  That's a great reference.  That's a swallow.  I like using a little literary knowledge in my cum jokes.  You like a taxi going through a puddle on a wet day?  Right.  We've got to go to South Africa.  What?  We've never taken a phone call from South Africa.  Wow.  It's a white person yelling, help me.  Exactly.  What's your name, sir?  Andre.  Andre.  Andre.  Ain't going to play Sun City.  That's all we know about South Africa. 
[02:47:00]  That's all we know.  Sun City, apartheid.  And you've got a guy trying to get away with murder.  Right.  Trying to get away with murder.  Patsy Kinzitz.  Hot chick, spatula feet.  Right.  And what else?  Apartheid.  You keep talking.  Soweto.  Sure.  What else?  That fucking District 9 movie.  Oscar Pistorius.  Oh, yes.  Spatula feet.  That's the guy trying to get away with murder.  Spatula feet.  They had flat, good runner feet.  Well, they don't wear shoes. 
[02:47:30]  Yo, South Africa, what do you got?  Yeah.  No, I just wanted to say I love you guys.  Jimmy is an absolute delight.  Thank you.  Yes.  And I know four people who listen to you guys as well.  Four other South Africans?  More than most countries.  So we're taking over South Africa.  Yeah.  That's good.  Oh, that sounds really nice.  And one other person I met who's a black guy, actually, he knew about it already when  I met him.  A black South African.  I think it's...  That's cool.  That's the coolest thing. 
[02:48:00]  That was so cool.  Like a real black South African.  All right.  So he's black.  We're international.  What do you guys think about Oscar Pistorius down there?  What's happening over there?  I think he absolutely did it.  But I think the defense did as good a job as they could do by trying to get some element  of doubt in that he thought it was an intruder.  I don't know if it'll wash.  I don't think it will.  Do you think that they'll...  Do they forgive down there in South Africa? 
[02:48:30]  Like, we didn't forgive O.J. in this country.  People still banned him.  O.J. didn't do it.  I don't know.  Let's ask the South African.  Yeah, he's South African.  He's still on the line just because he's calling from a faraway land.  If you were calling from Philly, dude, you would have been gone fucking 30 seconds ago.  Are you being hooked right now in a giant pot?  Hey, Buona.  Are you hearing Ooga Booga a lot?  He's on a big ship.  I'm the captain now.  Yes. 
[02:49:00]  We know nothing about this place.  As this guy's talking, he's running for his life out of a village.  Yes, exactly.  Are you dodging spears as you talk to us?  Oh, my God.  Wait till they hear about this in Nairobi.  Right?  I don't know.  We just don't know about South Africa.  We don't know anything.  Tell us one good thing about South Africa that you would think we wouldn't know.  One thing that you wouldn't know.  One good thing about South Africa.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think you pretty much got it down.  I think that's pretty much what's going on now. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, how is the post-apartheid South Africa as opposed to the pre-apartheid?  Well, I mean, I was born in 1986, so I didn't really experience that much.  But, you know, I think I would probably not like living in a police state like a Christian.  You wouldn't?  But it was the white people that were the police, so you'd have been cool.  Probably, yeah.  But, I mean, they wouldn't like you because I'm not really religious or something.  Oh, I gotcha. 
[02:50:00]  I gotcha.  Man.  Do the old people there wax fantastic about the good old days of apartheid?  Well, actually, I know someone in my family who said they used to be, like, really, you know,  they're very liberal and stuff, but they used to, like, be very anti-apartheid and stuff  and very much for the ANC and things.  And then afterwards...  It's like the Nazis.  There's no one there that was for apartheid. 
[02:50:30]  It's like, now in hindsight, everybody's like...  You guys want to go for four listeners in this country?  Yeah, right?  Keep this guy on.  You're right.  Jesus.  Who cares?  I just know that Sun City song.  That's all I know.  Right.  How are the chicks in South Africa?  Are the chicks hot?  They're hot.  I think so.  Sun City.  Yeah.  Are the chicks hot in South Africa?  Yeah, that fucking...  What's her name?  Blonde and blue eyes.  Blonde hair, blue eyes.  Riva Steenkamp or whatever?  What?  Yeah.  That fucking...  What's Charlize Theron? 
[02:51:00]  Charlize Theron is...  So hot.  ...is South African.  Yeah.  And old spatula feet girlfriend was fucking smoking.  Beautiful.  That's Riva, yeah.  That Patsy Kenseth was talking about her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who else is...  DeClerc was a handsome man.  DeClerc, you liked him?  He was the head of the apartheid, wasn't he?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  All right there, sir.  Thank you for a little jog around the world.  That was our segment.  That was our segment we call Round the World with O and A. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  You like that?  Yeah.  The boring ones always call from faraway places.  Apostrophe Round.  It's Farley phone call Thursday.  Right.  Nice.  I like that.  Yeah, what time is it over there?  I'm good.  That's always fun.  It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  Oh, let's get at it.  That's an average morning show bit.  Hey, what time is it over there?  What time is it over there?  Yeah, but we go with what day as well.  What day is it?  Is it Saturday?  I don't think he's over the date line.  No, it's Friday.  Yeah, it's Friday there. 
[02:52:00]  Wait, they're only four hours behind or ahead or whatever?  That's crazy.  He's full of turkey.  No, you should be.  Is it one of those wacky lines that go down and cut way over?  Something doesn't make sense.  I never paid much attention.  I thought it was later there.  11, 12, 1, 2.  Only four hours?  What is it?  It's 1956.  All right, Andre with an H.  Thank you.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying four hours.  Yeah, something's not right here, huh?  I think he's probably a South African living here. 
[02:52:30]  He's the guy from the gas station that that black lady was yelling at.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think it's only four hours.  That's way across the ocean.  Exactly.  I know my geography.  All right, sir.  We're hanging up on you now.  Where are you from, sir?  Where are you living now?  Well, I'm in Selenbosch.  It's near Cape Town.  You might have heard of Cape Town before.  Yeah, of course I have.  It's where Superman goes.  It's by his clothes.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that was a...  Yeah, England's like five hours. 
[02:53:00]  That's terrible.  Terrible.  It's four o'clock in Cape Town.  That's what hair will do for you, Jimmy.  It's four in the afternoon in Cape Town, sir.  Sir?  It's four o'clock.  You said two.  Do you not have a job, sir?  You said two.  What is your job?  Sorry, I was...  Are we still talking to this guy?  I know.  Shut it off.  All right, I'm going.  All right, thank you.  That was amazing.  Let's say hi to...  He's got a...  He better know what time it is, 
[02:53:30]  because at night he's got to do that thing.  The unmasked was phenomenal, boys.  The unmasked was really good.  Thank you.  It was really good.  I usually don't like that kind of,  how did we get here,  how does that...  You know what I mean?  That kind of stuff is always...  Thank you.  That whole...  That stuff is always boring.  But this was good.  Tammy trotted all over my joke.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I think she's on Coke this morning.  It's okay.  What was your joke?  I don't care.  What was your joke?  I missed it.  Can we go back?  Boom, boom, boom.  Let's try it.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  Because it had to be said during the time. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you say it?  It was a timing thing?  Yeah.  What had the guy said?  The South African guy has to know what time it is  so he can batten down his house like Will Smith had to  in, you know, that movie, whatever the movie was.  But see, it wasn't...  I am legend.  I loved you.  That's why I said that.  I am legend because it's South Africa,  so I'm assuming he's surrounded by zombie people  that want to kill him.  We have another huge fan of Jim Florentine on the line.  What?  Yes. 
[02:54:30]  God, you're on the phone.  My brother, Dan.  Who's this?  Oh, yeah.  They're just calling up to say hello to my friend  just in New York.  How are you?  I'm calling up to say hello to my good friend Jim Florentine,  okay?  Because this is how it works, okay?  I think he's funny.  He'd be so funny, okay?  Next thing you know, we're friends on Twitter, okay?  Not like the fucking radio show.  I've been calling for four fucking years.  I can't get a retweet or follow from anybody,  but it's okay.  Mike Francesca.  That's great.  Yes, definitely him.  Hey, Mike, I love when someone calls and,  hey, Mike, how you doing? 
[02:55:00]  What do you got?  Yeah, I just hope you're having a good day.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  He's so angry.  He never says hello.  What do you got?  Hey, Mike, happy holidays.  Hey, Mike, happy holidays.  To you, too.  Let's go.  That's it.  Hey, Mike, congratulations on 20 years at WFAN.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just a miserable fuck. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, Mike, congratulations on the Yankees winning the World Series last night.  You waited on a half hour on the phone to talk.  The school must be out, okay?  School must be out.  He knows him, man.  That's great.  Hey, Mike, what have you got on this Donald Sterling thing?  What's your take?  I talked about it on my Twitter.  You'd know if you followed me, okay?  Oh, shit.  Well, opiate to me.  Everybody's ashamed.  Dan hates me at Jimmy's board, okay?  So when I show up on a card show on Monday, I don't want to hear any bellyaching, okay?  Oh, shit. 
[02:56:00]  Wow.  I like Mike, I like Mike, Francesco.  Yeah, you're very aggressive today, Mike.  Well, I just woke up on the wrong side of the fucking stable this morning.  I'm sorry for that.  I really got nothing.  I can shed something on it.  South Africa, okay?  One thing I know in South Africa, they had to ruin a good thing, okay?  They had to all work out.  They got to ruin it.  It all worked out.  You guys have a good weekend.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye, Mike.  Bye, Francesco, everyone.  Very funny.  He does a great job.  He's great.  Miserable.  He's wonderful.  Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
[02:56:30]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  God damn.  Yeah.  Any big plans for the big weekend?  Oh, hell no.  It's not a big weekend, but.  What do we got?  Mike, go to Otto's thing, right?  Sunday.  Sunday.  Oh, is it Memorial Sunday?  Yeah.  Do that Sunday.  Are you going, Jim?  Yeah.  They're not going to prop George up somewhere, are they?  I wonder if he's going to.  In a corner or something.  He's probably going to go with him, don't you think?  That would be so creepy.  I don't want to see.  No, Otto's family might want him.  Maybe. 
[02:57:00]  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's Sunday.  Today is kids eating banana splits for someone's birthday.  Oh, really?  You got to.  Tomorrow's some kind of kid fair.  Jeez.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, sure.  Should be great.  Be wonderful.  Wow.  Do a lot of kid stuff, quarantine.  Try to avoid it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's hard.  They look at you like you're a crazy person.  The other parents.  Oh, so you're gone all the time? 
[02:57:30]  Well, they don't understand what your job entails.  They're probably jealous.  Yeah.  I don't.  How do you do it?  Well, I get on a plane and then I come home.  I leave.  Yeah, you got a young one.  Well, no, he's six now.  That's young.  Yeah, he's younger than mine.  Yeah, but that's young for leaving him all the time.  That's true.  Damn, you're calling her a horrible mother right there.  Well, you know.  What am I going to do?  This is all I have.  She has to do it.  Yeah, and then they do that whole, you know, tell me when you're playing in the area.  I'll come see you. 
[02:58:00]  No, you won't.  No.  Do you tell them?  No, I just go.  Never.  I'm playing tonight.  Can you come?  Yeah.  No?  Okay.  There you go.  I don't do any shows in New Jersey.  Oh, really?  Well, I'll go to New York.  No, you won't.  No, you won't.  You haven't left this neighborhood in frigging six years.  It's funny, too, because I sent my son to, like, a Catholic school.  And I don't think they knew what I was about.  And I'm not saying that I'm, like, even the dirtiest.  But the truth is, is this one family, like, was watching the special.  They're going, we're going to watch your special.  We're going to watch your special.  Oh, yeah.  And the next day, I go, did you see it? 
[02:58:30]  And they go, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Like, it was just too much.  That's what happens with this show sometimes.  People are like, what is that?  Let me get a pencil and paper and write the channel down.  What is it?  I'm like, oh, God, I've got to give them the wrong fucking number.  They can't hear this show.  That's fucking crazy.  I don't want to be.  Like, you get that, like, you go to the doctor or a dentist or something.  And they're like, what's the channel?  No.  Yeah.  It's not for you.  Yeah.  If you don't know, there's no point.  Like, you.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not going to enjoy this. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We're not looking for new members here.  Get away.  Stay away.  Do you, like, have an agent or something?  The book should know.  I just fucking show up in the place.  I knock on the door.  I fucking fly to the Improv in Tempe, Arizona.  I knock on the door.  Can I go on stage?  Have you ever, have you ever been on TV?  Have you ever, and you're like, yeah, you know.  You know who I like?  Oh, no.  I wish it was Jack Kevorkian.  Fucking asshole.  Give a fuck who you like.  You know who's really funny?  Yeah.  Hitler?  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  Fucking asshole.  I don't care who you like.  That'll stop the conversation.  Wow.  Yeah, people say that, right?  Yeah, then you won't like me.  And my favorite of all time is when you're having a conversation with somebody at a party  or something, and somebody else comes over and goes, what do you say in front of him?  He'll put it on his show.  That's right.  Really?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, Opie.  I got a great story.  I was at a party, and this guy started telling me about his shingles.  Right.  And, yeah, great.  I'll stay careful.  This guy will use this in his routine. 
[03:00:00]  In his act.  You should come by our offices.  You'll get a lot of material there.  Will we?  No, you won't.  But then you find out, what do you do?  It's like, well, I work in an abortion clinic slash hat store.  Well, I just smite.  You're right, sir.  I was just there last week.  We got something for Club Soda Kenny's birthday.  What?  It's Kenny's birthday today.  It is?  It's a fucking resignation.  It's Clubby's birthday today.  Where's Clubby?  Aw.  We got some... 
[03:00:30]  I did not know that.  It's my niece's birthday, too.  We got some treats.  Mine and Kenny's birthday were so close together.  And Bobo's.  Kenny.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday, Kenny.  He's not happy.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Kenny.  Happy birthday to you.  Aw, someone has a birthday haircut.  Aw. 
[03:01:00]  I did.  I did get a birthday haircut.  It's a cake in the shape of a car.  You can't even smile on his birthday.  His friends singing him happy birthday.  Why aren't you smiling on your birthday, Kenny?  Kenny.  I'm overwhelmed.  Aw.  Aw.  He's crying.  Deeper and dead.  Yeah.  But thank you for the nice sentiment.  Aw.  Nice wishes.  It's just...  Kenny...  It just reminds him it's another year past when you could have beat people over the head  with a billy club.  Yes.  Right?  I'm over the hill.  Oh, not at all.  I hope Eric and Roland enjoy the cupcakes. 
[03:01:30]  Aw.  Kenny doesn't eat cupcakes.  Aw.  Happy birthday.  What are you doing?  Look at who's here to wish you a happy birthday.  Denny Falcone.  Oh, thank God.  Denny Falcone is a singer.  Denny Falcone.  Denny, a few words for Kenny's birthday.  I want a long picture with Kenny.  What are you doing?  Look at his face.  I love his smile.  Why does he have his fucking great cupcake?  It's from Brazil.  Denny.  How sweet.  A couple words for Kenny's birthday.  Let's go.  Falcone, you do birthday dedications and stuff like that?  That's right.  Why don't you treat it like that?  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason we came here is something. 
[03:02:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what song would  you do?  We need a little music.  Somewhat a long ramp up.  It doesn't even have to be a happy birthday song.  Somewhat a long ramp up that you can talk over with Kenny's birthday.  You mean something like maybe the Beatles and Birthday?  Ah.  All right, let's try that.  I don't have cans on.  Oh, shit.  Oh, here.  Let me get this.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  This is for Kenny.  All right, give me birthday.  Beatles.  Wow.  It's demanding these days.  It's very demanding.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we came here today is to celebrate our guest of  honor, Kenny, on his happy 21st birthday. 
[03:02:30]  Why does he look 21 years young?  Come on, ladies and gentlemen, everybody, give it up for Kenny.  Wow.  That's a horrible ramp up.  I thought you were going to hit the post.  I just kind of threw it.  But here's the post right now, okay?  Yeah.  Here you go.  No, you missed it by eight minutes.  No, that was a ramp.  No.  I didn't hit the post.  Get out of here.  Rambo.  Rambo.  Get him in a ramp.  Actually, I'm doing it.  You suck.  Kill him.  Well, you know what? 
[03:03:00]  If we want to take it to the street, he's got herpes.  How about a little 50 cent?  He's got herpes.  Oh, my God.  A little 50 cent in there, in the club.  Hey, Florentine.  In the club?  We were talking to Denny because we learned recently that he blows himself.  No, I don't.  Sam?  Just leave it alone.  Where the heck did you get that from?  He's tasted his own dick.  Yeah, he's tasted his own dick.  What do you think of that, Jim Florentine?  I want his autograph.  See?  That's just silly.  See, that's impressive, Denny.  Yeah, I have a friend that could do that. 
[03:03:30]  He got the tip in.  He did?  Yeah, he got the helmet in.  How did he feel about it?  He loved it.  Wow.  And he did it in front of all of us, and we cheered him on.  Sexual harassment.  That's good.  Denny doesn't work blue, but we learned that he sucks his own dick.  I don't know.  Where the heck did you get that from?  Where the heck?  Where the heck did you get that from?  One of the positive things that happened when he got run over by a car is a child.  Yeah, what are you guys running on me?  That's right.  Rip on Kenny.  It's your birthday.  Rip so to Kenny on Facebook.  Wish him a happy birthday.  Yeah, wish him a happy birthday on his Facebook page.  Give it up for Kenny. 
[03:04:00]  Were you an Aries?  Shut up.  No.  No.  Taurus.  You're a Taurus like me.  Me too.  When is your birthday?  Ah, 26th.  It just passed.  15th.  Wow, look at us.  GH, it's his birthday month too.  Yeah.  Two weeks from today?  Yeah.  No.  When's my birthday?  Three weeks from today.  30 what?  38.  38.  Wow.  That's nice.  Did you brought Dennis to make my nose feel better?  I want a fork.  Denny, you're lucky it's Kenny's birthday.  We'll talk about your dick sucking later. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Put a fork in him, he's dumb.  Dung, dumb.  Put a fork in him, he's dumb.  Yeah.  It's not as powerful when you have a cupcake in your hand.  Oh, look who comes in.  I'm going to have a bite of a cupcake.  Are you?  Yeah, it's a little peaceful.  Yeah.  I can't believe your transformation, Jimmy.  And they look great.  Right, yeah.  Like he's in a competition.  I know.  Fucking chopped liver.  I lost these goddamn pounds.  You look good.  I almost got rid of my lava belly. 
[03:05:00]  And then he can blow himself.  And then he can fucking blow himself.  He doesn't have the slim body of somebody that's able to do that.  Jim picked a red velvet cupcake, if anybody is interested to know.  Oh, yeah.  And then he got run over by that car as a child.  I think that popped out a hip or something to make it a lot easier to blow himself.  Oh, yeah.  Like double jointed.  Yeah.  I don't do that.  He had his bottom rib removed.  Well, why would they have that?  I don't know where they got that from.  His bottom rib removed. 
[03:05:30]  He had his bottom rib removed.  Dude, you worked that shit.  That's something to be proud of.  You can blow yourself.  You worked that shit.  Oh, slinky spine.  Vanilla cupcake with red frosting.  All right.  A little play-by-play.  I like it.  I feel like I'm at a kid's party with these cupcakes.  Oh, I forgot you don't like cupcakes.  14's not a fan of the cupcakes.  I love a good cupcake.  I had a little...  14, I had a Yankee Doodle cupcake.  There you go.  When I was 14, I was the last one I had.  Look how angry he gets a Yankee Doodle.  That's a bad thing.  I'm a grown-up.  I don't eat cupcakes. 
[03:06:00]  My three-and-a-half-year-old loves them.  He should.  He likes the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, too.  He should.  Yeah.  Cupcake.  Yeah, but it's much better than the one cake  where you blow the candles out  and the spit goes all over it.  I was never a fan of eating the cake  after the candles blown out.  Yes.  It's funny, the guy who thumbs off a condom  while fucking a stranger.  I hate when a spittle flies onto a cake.  Walter Conley and Ritz Roselle  just texted me happy birthday.  Who are they?  What?  Look how happy he is.  Look how cute he is. 
[03:06:30]  Look at Kenny.  And I got a very generous birthday gift this morning.  Oh.  I didn't know it was your birthday.  Yeah, you always treat me to dinner.  He got that picture from Kiss,  the first thing it comes to me.  He stole it from you.  Scott said him the same thing, yeah?  Yeah.  He had the only one picture.  Well, happy birthday, Kenny.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  Many more.  Happy birthday, Kenny.  Thank you very much.  How are you going to celebrate your birthday later?  One more. 
[03:07:00]  I have plans for tonight.  Oh.  Really?  What are you doing?  What, Fridays?  You got that?  A young lady?  Your gift card expires, so you got to use it tonight?  No, I can't talk about it.  Whoa.  You feel like the Club Soda Kenny fans are going to follow you if you mention a restaurant you  might go to or something?  No, no, no.  I'm just a private person.  You're neither of those things.  I know.  So you're going to go to like a restaurant and get some food? 
[03:07:30]  Well, I did get a $25 birthday gift certificate from Morton's Steakhouse.  Oh.  What are you going to do with that?  He loves Morton's.  He loves Morton's.  I'll get you a fucking half a potato.  So you're going to use it?  You're going to use that tonight?  I'm not letting that go to waste.  Oh.  So that's where you're going to go tonight, Morton's.  Well, maybe tonight.  Yeah.  Maybe tomorrow.  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  Nice.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Thank you, everyone.  Look how cute you are.  I didn't mean to bring the show down. 
[03:08:00]  Well, you know.  That's why we saved it to the end.  No, believe me.  The cupcakes brought the show down.  Ah, yeah.  I had a half of one.  It was good.  Would you like a cupcake, Florentine?  Dick thing.  Why don't you try one?  For Kenny's birthday.  For what?  Why not?  I got another text message.  Happy birthday from Sean Bennett, who happens to be a chief of police somewhere.  Whoa.  Wow.  Look at these cupcakes.  How do you not like a good cupcake?  I know the chief of police.  That does nothing.  There's a box of cupcakes.  What about the red velvet ones? 
[03:08:30]  A guy's ass does more for me than looking at those cupcakes.  He'd have to turn his shirt backwards anyway.  It would look wrong to eat a cupcake with that savage shirt on.  Look who's talking about Al-Qaeda and terror attacks.  Mike Baker.  Mike Baker, who got duped by a fake Roland.  Exactly.  He's on Fox News right now, talking CIA stuff.  He's the guy that got duped.  Yeah.  Well, Baker's got his trusted guy, Eddie Snowden, is working on something.  That was great Coke Logic texting me. 
[03:09:00]  Ah.  Cocaine.  That's good.  Yeah.  A lot of people are coming on board with happy birthdays for Kenny.  I like seeing that.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, everyone.  You're welcome, Kenny.  Well, you know.  Enjoy your birthday.  Thank you.  Thank you.  If I have...  Oh, are there any fucking reads left?  Give it a gift card in your desk.  How many?  Two.  Nice.  Do one now.  Give me one.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would love to tell you about...  What?  Oh, the music starts.  Ah, you've got to surprise your mommy.

[03:10:30]  Was your gift from OPIE a giant collared shirt?  No.  I did tell him to get new jeans.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, wow.  The mom jeans?  He needs to get rid of the mom jeans.

Roland, happy birthday.  Okay.  How many texts mess in that BlackBerry take?  Isn't there a limit? 
[03:12:30]  No, this is the latest model.  It's the latest model.  There's no latest model with a BlackBerry.  Even I, stuck in the stone ages, gave it on my BlackBerry two and a half years ago.  Even the company's not using them anymore.  It's actually more technologically sound to write notes and hold them up.  Fucking BlackBerry.  You're all jealous.  The BlackBerry's making a comeback.  There is 2013 birthday wishes.  It's a year late.  I understood.  It's, you know, an old phone.  Yeah, I know.  It's a good one.  It's a stupid phone, Kenny.  You don't like it?  No. 
[03:13:00]  It's got a sidekick.  What is it?  It's got buttons?  I like tactile buttons.  Happy birthday from your pals at XXM Canada in Toronto.  What?  The boys that helped us out when we were up there, huh?  That's probably that Mark Alfalfa guy.  We were in Montreal.  Wait a minute.  Who?  Alfalfa.  It's all the same to me.  It's all one hunk of fucking not America.  That's what I call Canada.  No, quarantine was doing his plug.  Not America.  I rudely interrupted him.  No, I don't want to, you know, just in case another one comes through.  It might be a happy birthday.
