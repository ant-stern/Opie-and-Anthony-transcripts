<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous commemoration of the one-year anniversary of the leaked Scarlett Johansson nude photos, featuring copious amounts of inappropriate language and humor from Opie, Anthony, E-Rock, and Sam Roberts.  E-Rock's attempts to disrupt the planned bit added to the comedic chaos.  This transitioned into a scathing critique of the *America's Got Talent* finale, with the hosts expressing extreme disgust at a dog act winning and harshly judging the runner-up, Tom Cotter, whom they deemed a mediocre comedian.  Their criticism extended to the judges and the show itself, using vulgar language throughout.

The conversation then shifted to *The X Factor*, focusing on Britney Spears's seemingly impaired appearance and a contestant's seemingly edited-out coming-out moment.  A clip of a contestant's performance was played and reviewed.  The hosts also discussed the waning popularity of reality shows like *Survivor* and *Big Brother*.  Rich Voss joined the show in studio at this point, contributing his opinions on *The X Factor* and other television programs.  The discussion about Tom Cotter's performance continued, delving into the differences between "road comics" and those who succeed in mainstream television, marked by frequent vulgarity and offensive jokes.  The hosts compared various comedians, often with strongly worded and dismissive opinions, including  Brian Regan and Colin Quinn. A significant portion involved crude and explicit commentary on the visual appeal of genitalia, with graphic descriptions and on-screen images.  A heated phone call with Colin Quinn ensued, escalating the use of offensive language and personal attacks, primarily focusing on the earlier criticisms of Tom Cotter and differing comedy styles. The segment concluded with further discussion of physical appearance and female body types.

Rich Voss's segment began with a discussion of Colin Quinn, described by E-Rock as a "brilliant but a mumbling douchebag."  Vos recounted a frustrating experience with a Connecticut radio station, sparking a geographical debate. He then offered highly critical and often vulgar commentary on other comedians, including John Panette, Bobby Kelly, and Norton.  Vos shared personal anecdotes, including details about his wife Bonnie's reactions to his comedy and political views, and contrasted his career with Jerry Seinfeld's.  The Scarlett Johansson anniversary was revisited with sexually explicit language and humor, including a song about "big balls."  A call from Vos's daughter demanding an iPhone 5 and other items highlighted her entitled attitude, leading to a discussion on parental responsibility and generational differences. Vos also briefly discussed his views on different ethnic groups.  The segment concluded with further banter and mentions of upcoming guests.

A phone call with Rich Vos's demanding daughter reiterated the discussion on parental responsibility.  J.J. Abrams then joined to promote *Revolution* and the upcoming *Star Trek* film, discussing the show's premise and production.  Anthony's anxious stock market activities, particularly with Apple options, were heavily featured, interlaced with commentary from the hosts and Rich Vos. The broadcast concluded with criticism of the show's soundboard operator, Sal, for inattentiveness during a live read, followed by standard commercial plugs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Uh, E-Rock? Seriously?  E-Rock.  You turned on the music?  It's a very special day.  You know what today is, E-Rock?  Do you have any idea?  No, I don't.  Oh, boy.  Sam, do you know what today is?  Of course I know what today is.  You really don't know what's going on today, E-Rock?  I know what's going on today.  I have a calendar. 
[00:00:30]  Do you know or are you just making believe you know?  No, one year ago today.  Oh, boy.  Well, how about you don't wreck the bit that I was trying to set up?  He's got no sense of timing.  He's terrible.  It's as if it's his first day every day for the last eight years.  I was trying to play off you.  Note to self, don't play off E-Rock.  Sometimes I'll look at Anthony and I'll go, I don't have to tell him.  And he doesn't have to tell me.  He just knows, oh, okay, he's going for something here. 
[00:01:00]  I'll play my part in this scenario.  Just go along with it.  E-Rock, oh, yeah, I actually do know when it's blah, blah.  No, turn down the music.  He's still got the music.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock.  We're just start the day again.  We're just fumbling broadcasters.  We can't do this properly.  Goodness gracious.  I guess next time I'll give you all the notes where I'm going with this, right?  That would be nice.  He prefers to be handed a script in the morning.  You think?  Yeah.  It's a very special day.  It really is. 
[00:01:30]  It really is.  It really is.  Today, the Opie and Anthony Show presents a very special show.  This is going to change society.  A show in memoriam.  Traffic is really bad.  People are walking across the Brooklyn Bridge right now just to get home to their computer.  Of a day that remains burned in our memories forever.  I literally stopped breathing for two seconds.  Today, we remember.  I'm standing on 26th Street in the West Side Highway, and from my vantage point, this penis is jumping out of zippers. 
[00:02:00]  September 14th, 2011.  Know what this just replaced?  Where I was when my son was born.  The day we saw Scarlett Johansson nude.  Oh, look at the titty.  Oh, my God.  The titty's right there on the screen.  I have no words.  I just want the pictures to speak for themselves.  Moment of silence, please.  Join us as we reflect on not only the event.  Innocence.  We've lost a piece of our innocence and some comp. 
[00:02:30]  But the people that were affected by 9-14.  I am one of the IT first responders here at ilikegirlsdaily.com.  Sir, I just watched server 7 go down.  Yeah, I want to know how I can donate lube and tissues.  I almost just fear-ended somebody.  I just want to be looking at the beautiful ass that is Scarlett Johansson.  And as how we as a nation overcame.  The city, the nation, I think is going to come together.  There will be vigils.  But instead of candles, we just will be grabbing these shafts of our dick and standing there in silent prayer. 
[00:03:00]  Never forget, when we were erect.  9-11, if you remember, we were all fucking driving around with those American flags.  We need something that brings us all together here.  Yes.  Remembering 9-14 on The Opie and Anthony Show.  That is really good.  Wow.  Wow.  It was already a year ago.  That's something.  That's Scarlett Johansson's nude pictures made the internet.  Wow, that long ago.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  It's like it happened yesterday.  We're looking at the pictures.  Oh, my God.  Wow, that is something.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is what stopped Jerry the King Lawler's heart.  Yeah.  He finally saw the nudes of Scarlett Johansson.  Yeah, he knew a year was coming up.  Oh, my God.  You remember that?  Wow, look at that ass, Ed.  Look at that ass.  That's the mirror pic you talk about.  It's got everything in it.  Her face, the ass.  It has all the features, right?  It's such an artistically done mirror shot. 
[00:04:00]  It's beautiful.  I'm really starting to get the same feeling I got a year ago.  You know?  Those emotions just get rekindled like this.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's just beautiful.  We should have synced up the time.  Yeah, right.  Oh, my God.  I want to thank E-Rock.  He played that perfectly today.  E-Rock almost fucking completely blew it.  Yeah.  He was going to say, I know. 
[00:04:30]  Today was the day we saw Scarlett Johansson.  I know.  He's trying to blow it.  And that would have been the reveal.  There was a reveal there.  There was a total reveal, right?  And he's ready to just go, yeah, this is Scarlett Johansson.  The pictures were a year ago.  All right.  Well, forget it.  Just put the music back on.  And, you know, I started doing radio early in my life.  But E-Rock, my God, he started doing radio when he was like 12.  He should have known better.  One of those child prodigies.  He was a child prodigy.  I don't know what happened to him.  When did he get into radio officially, E-Rock? 
[00:05:00]  16.  Who gets into radio at 16?  He was the Doogie Howser of radio.  He was.  Right?  Because, like, I know all the professions you could get into it early.  But radio, you've got to wait for your voice to actually get a little balls to it.  No, he was just running around radio studios his whole life.  What was your first job in radio?  Something to do with Scott Shannon, I'm sure.  No.  Station on Long Island.  WBLI.  BLI.  BLI.  B-A-B Sister Station.  What do you do for BLI? 
[00:05:30]  First round, I said I was in college and got an internship when I was still a sophomore in high school.  How'd you do that?  Oh, you tricked her.  They just never filled out all the paperwork.  Oh.  Back then, they didn't care.  Were you shaving?  Wait, so you took your boat from Florida?  Yeah.  I guess you could go up the coast.  Yeah.  It takes a long time.  Inter-coastal waterway.  Yeah, and then you could park in one of those, I guess Babylon or something.  You could probably get into Babylon, right?  So your whole radio career was based on a lie, is what you're saying. 
[00:06:00]  First two years, yes.  Oh, well.  Ah, it continues to this day.  The lies.  And the deceit.  Right?  The deceit.  Vagaries.  Yeah, I think I filled out the paperwork for that.  It must have been how it started.  He had to.  It was out of necessity.  I think the third page was...  What?  I don't know.  I gotta go do a thing.  Did you see the news?  Did you see the news today?  Iraq was chewed my ear off about America's Got Talent.  He's hungry.  Right, Iraq?  Yeah, it sucked. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, you guys were tweeting last night about it.  Well, I...  And this is the truth.  I mean, if you really want to know, I didn't watch America's Got Talent that much this season  because I really don't like fucking Howard Stern.  Yeah.  I don't like the guy.  I caught it.  I fucking hate him, actually.  He's a fucking prick.  A couple of times.  And...  But I did watch last night.  It was the big finale.  And so I watched a bit because I wasn't really interested in the football yesterday.  And I was howling and everyone was howling on Twitter that in the end, they picked a 
[00:07:00]  dog act to win America's Got Talent.  A dog act.  I swear when the dog act was like one of the final six, every time they were like the next  one to get voted off, I was like, well, obviously the dog act is going to be in sixth  place.  Yeah.  I guess it'll be in fifth place.  Yeah.  I guess it'll be in fourth place.  And then they win the whole thing.  Do you have...  Is there a summit online to see the grand finale thing where they finally go, hey, it's the  dog act?  Well, but the problem is they eliminate people throughout the entire show. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Then they brought Justin Bieber and Green Day in.  You know what that's about.  What?  They were trying to pump up the ratings because everyone knows America's Got Talent didn't  do so well this summer.  No.  You know, I have my theory, but in general, I mean, you know, the record will show it didn't  do as well as past seasons.  Right.  Some would argue, well, the Olympics, well, the DNC, the RNC, the blah, blah, blah, whatever.  That's up to you guys to argue.  But the fact does remain that the ratings were not as good. 
[00:08:00]  And so they pumped it up by getting Justin Bieber and Green Day to perform on it.  That's huge.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's huge for any show.  So then they eliminate all the acts.  And I guess they had some cool acts.  They had the guy that plays the whole arena as a fucking musical instrument.  Right.  Holy fuck.  How does he do that?  Sets up all the shit and plays the basically playing the arena.  You saw that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there was a couple of really cool artists.  The one with the splashing the paint and I don't know what modern music. 
[00:08:30]  Giroc, I swear to you, that was the first time I saw that act was last night when they  showed some clips of the guy.  What does he do?  Him and his team, they go around and they splash paint in different directions and you  can't really figure out what the hell they're doing until the very last minute because  they do it in separate parts.  But isn't that similar to the sand guy?  It's very similar.  Yeah.  It is.  They do it paint instead of sand.  So why would they have both those guys as finalists?  Oh, brother.  I don't know.  I mean, they were both good. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  But I thought the paint guys were going to win.  The paint guys were way better than the sand guys.  Well, here's my point.  Tom Cotter is a nice guy.  We've known Tom Cotter forever.  We've said no to Tom Cotter on our show because there's comics that are way funnier and way  better.  He's a solid road comic.  He's been at it a long time.  He's good.  Don't get me wrong.  He's a good comic.  He knows what the fuck he's doing on the stage.  But he's nothing special. 
[00:09:30]  And America's Got Talent, I guess, they just kept kissing his ass like he's the next fucking  great comic.  He's an average comic at best.  My point is this.  He was the runner-up of America's Got Talent.  That says a lot.  That's sad.  They got problems with that show if they think Tom Cotter is the runner-up and they think  a dog act is the winner.  That's America voting.  Yeah.  As far as Tom Cotter goes, there's probably 10 comics that do our show on a regular basis  that are way better.  Way the fuck better.  And if we were asked to have Tom Cotter, I would go, no. 
[00:10:00]  Even after he came in second?  No!  He's just not interested.  No!  But he's a nice guy and, you know, congratulations to him and, you know, he'll make more money  because of the show.  But I think they blew it by, you know, pushing him forward as much as they did.  How is this any different than, like, Star Search or the gong show?  Well, what?  America's Got Talent?  Yeah.  Any of these fucking shows.  It's, uh, it's like an updated kind of gong show.  Yeah.  It really is.  That's all it is. 
[00:10:30]  Plus, you get a million dollars in a Vegas act?  Yeah.  If people are going to go to Vegas.  So the dogs have a Vegas act?  Exactly right.  Oh, my God.  It's a dog act.  Like, you'd watch that if you went to a circus for a couple minutes and went, oh, that's  cool.  Bring in the lions now.  Like, they should do this at intermission at the dog show.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  There you go.  That would be perfect.  When I was a kid, this would be on Ed Sullivan.  Right.  When I was in the 80s.  Would you sit through a dog act for, you would have to, if you went to Vegas, you'd have  to sit through a dog act for an hour.  Fuck that.  How is that going to keep your interest? 
[00:11:00]  Never.  Never.  At first, you'd probably go, oh, it's adorable.  Right.  And then after, like, three minutes, you're sitting there going, oh, no.  How much longer am I going to have to watch these dogs jump around on their hind legs?  I think they blew it.  I think as a show, they just fucking blew it.  That's just dumb.  They had some extremely creative acts.  In the finals there.  And they knocked them out early in the show.  And then it was down to a comic that's okay and a dog act.  And then they give it to the dog act.  I was howling.  E-Rock, were you howling? 
[00:11:30]  Oh.  I was yelling.  Why were you yelling?  Because some would say this is pure jealousy.  Here's what we're spewing.  Pure jealousy.  Here's what's aggravating.  Through the whole season, Howard kept stressing, it's a million-dollar act they're looking for.  It needs to be original, something America has never seen.  And when you have the six finalists, four of them, you're like, okay, these are acts that you don't really get to see.  One of these could win it.  And the fucking dog act is something that no one wants to see, but everybody's been seeing that for years. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  To be fair, I've never seen a poodle do that many backflips.  Oh, it did backflips.  Oh, okay, then I agree.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  All right, well, play the clip.  Is this from last night?  This is from two nights ago.  This is the actual final performance they got voted on.  That made them...  That made America go, like, you got talent.  Well, dude, the dog is driving out in one of those little electric escalades.  Sure.  Like a little car that a kid would drive around in.  Well, my kid does. 
[00:12:30]  That's nice.  And he does a very good job.  He can fucking drive that thing.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, but he's got opposable thumbs.  Oh, that's true.  The dog doesn't have that.  How's he hit the little gas pedal?  Oh, that's right.  It's radio control, and the dog isn't driving the fucking car.  Oh, wow.  You just gave it away.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You know, I was wondering about that, and I think you're right.  So the dog is just sitting there?  Yeah, the dog's just sitting there.  Oh.  The dog ain't driving a fucking car.  Oh.  All right, push play.  Let's see if the dog is driving the fucking car. 
[00:13:00]  He's driving.  He's just sitting there.  He's still going.  And then it still goes after he gets out.  See that?  Oh, yeah.  They blew it by doing that.  All right.  He's jumping on his little hind legs.  Yeah.  This is the winner?  Yeah.  This is a fucking 1970s variety show act.  That dog's going to have hip problems before it's four.  Yeah, displace you.  Look, I respect people for defending their king, but the fact remains, this is a dumb move  on America's Got Talent.  That's a tall poodle. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  That poodle's pretty tall.  They're all walking on their back legs.  Great.  You're going to sit through this for an hour.  Remember, an hour.  I bet PETA doesn't like this.  No.  Dog's with sore legs.  They're playing music that would play in our bathroom here at the Sirius XM.  Yeah.  They're jumping over.  They're jumping what?  Lil' Bichon is running around and going through a little obstacle course.  I don't know.  And I was rolling over.  Roll over.  Roll over.  I don't know what's going on.  What's going on? 
[00:14:00]  I don't know.  It's just a bunch of dogs doing stupid things.  Oh, it tripped.  It didn't even fucking do it right.  And can you pause?  Pause.  Get it?  This is why Piers Morgan was way better on this fucking show than the judges they got  now.  Yeah.  Piers Morgan always said, because I used to love this fucking show and watched every season.  He says, if you've got a dog act or any type of animal act, if they fuck up once, you're  God.  Wow.  He did.  He always said that. 
[00:14:30]  He goes, there's no room to fuck up if you're an animal act.  Because that's the whole thing about putting an animal act together is doing it so they  don't fuck up.  I could get a dog act together, but all they do is fuck up.  So the dog fucking up as they're doing their finals right there, that should have been  enough for America to go, okay, it's all cutesy and shit, and I could watch this for  30 seconds, but it's not a million dollar act.  He tripped over that last little thing he was supposed to jump over.  All right.  Hit it again.  Dumb dog.  Fucking stupid dog.  More of this dumb fucking variety show shit. 
[00:15:00]  Look, there's nothing going on.  Because they've got to set up the next stunt.  The little dog is pushing the big round barrel thing, and the other dog is on top of it walking  backwards.  That's not a talent.  The dog's just trying to survive.  It doesn't want to fall on its ass.  All right.  He's setting up a dog, and then he...  Oh, my God.  He punted it.  Look at it.  Oh.  Oh, the dog's doing those backflips in one place.  All right.  Did four backflips.  Good.  Oh, what are they going to do now? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, now they're doing some kind of weird sexual 69 move with the dog.  There you go, Ant.  That's one America's Got Talent.  As you know, I lost my dog this year, and I think...  Maybe got to bring one of the dogs home.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah, isn't Howard an animal activist?  I think so.  He shouldn't like acts like this.  I guess he looked the other way, because someone's too good, huh? 
[00:16:00]  Exploiting.  Yeah, the animal rights people don't like those type of things.  No, they don't like animals being used for any type of entertainment.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Peter will fucking get very angry.  So, E-Rock, you were very angry that the dog act won?  Very angry.  Who should have won?  Either...  Like Sam, I was leaning towards the paint guys or the earth harp guy.  He's the one that set the whole building up as a musical instrument.  Yeah, that's beyond unique and creative, and I've never seen anything like that before. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, but he had a stupid gold jacket on.  Oh, really?  I don't want to hang out with a guy with a gold jacket on, you know?  You should look cool while you do it.  Century 21 realtor.  Exactly.  He is.  So that show's over now.  That's my two cents on it, my dumb observation.  There was also a time when there's no way that Howard Stern would sit through a Justin Bieber performance while he had a...  Like, shouldn't Howard Stern, shouldn't he do like a buzzer on Justin Bieber as a prank, and everybody goes, oh, that's outrageous. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, of course.  Talking many, many years ago.  Of course.  That would have been hilarious.  That gentleman does not exist anymore.  You tell the producers of America's Got Talent, like, I got something.  And it'll get people talking, too.  Leave my buzzer live.  Yeah, just leave my buzzer live.  I got this.  Yeah.  Yes, Sam.  The old guy would have done that.  Someone suggesting Howard wasn't there for the Bieber performance?  He absolutely was.  The judges were sitting at the table.  It was taped on Mundell.  So you don't know what you're talking about. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, they might have taped it ahead of time and then just slid it into the fucking live show.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Well, then.  It was taped.  A lot of people are saying it was taped.  Justin Bieber, I don't get it.  We're just too old.  I have to admit it.  What?  What is so special about the guy?  Well, he was talented before his voice changed.  Right.  And he can dance.  He's a good dancer.  Yeah, I think he's terrible.  Yeah, he's actually not that good of a dancer.  I think he's a terrible dancer as far as when you see people that can dance.  Like, I'm not a dance fucking critic. 
[00:18:00]  But when you see people that can do it very well, you know it.  Yeah.  Just by watching.  Right.  He doesn't do anything that's like, wow.  You know, that's amazing.  I don't know.  He seems like just an average pop-back to me.  I don't know.  He dances slightly less good than those dogs did.  Did he do any backflips?  No, I don't think.  Yeah, because he used to, like, you know, before his voice changed, his songs were very catchy.  His voice was, you know, there and everything.  Girls love him, so he's one of these fucking little pop idols.  Yeah, I get it.  But it's funny, because I saw, coming up, our interview with Justin Bieber. 
[00:18:30]  Coming up.  And then he said something like, I don't want to be, you know, just be another one of these teen idols.  Oh, boy.  I'm really hoping.  He already knows in his head, like, oh, fuck.  It's over.  Oh, fuck.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Well, good luck to you on that, because I don't think he has talent that goes, you know.  Doesn't transcend the pop idol thing.  No, I don't think so.  He'll live that world for a little longer, and then he's going to be in deep trouble, I think.  Next thing happens. 
[00:19:00]  I got to tell you, I saw Green Day's performance on that show.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Fucking Green Day, man.  Still good?  I think so.  Was that their new song they were performing?  Because I liked it.  No, that was off their, I forgot the title, but it was off their last album, One of my guns.  I'm definitely behind on the Green Day thing, but that song they played last night, I really liked a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe we could play it into break or something, I don't know.  Oh, and speaking of award shows, Ann hasn't seen her yet?  The X Factor?  Mm-hmm.  With Britney Spears?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck's up with her, and why isn't America talking about this? 
[00:19:30]  She's haggard, man.  Because apparently no one's watching the show.  Oh, really?  Ratings are down?  Yeah.  Way down.  She is so fucking haggard.  Yes.  And she looks like she's on something, and she just keeps studying the people in a weird  way that makes you uncomfortable to watch.  She's giving them the stink eye?  I was watching more of that last night than America's, I was going back and forth, but  she was fascinating me, because I'm like, what is wrong with this broad?  Why is she on national TV?  Let's take a look at her here.  Britney.  Britney's debut.  Huh?  How about you go full screen? 
[00:20:00]  So we could see.  There we go.  All right.  I thought it was just kind of bad.  It's hard to tell.  Like, when you watch in HD, her skin's all blotchy.  Her skin is horrendous.  Yeah.  She looks good on a fuzzy computer.  Yeah, a fuzzy computer.  She looks good.  Yeah, there's some filters going on there, but she holds herself like this.  Like, she's kind of cold.  She's like this.  Really?  And she squints a lot, and she kind of does this staring.  Like, she's in deep thought, but you know she's not, because it's just a dumb, silly 
[00:20:30]  fucking, you know, talent show.  Yeah.  And her emotions are all off kilter.  Like, she doesn't laugh when it's funny.  Yeah.  And then she moves her body to the side.  Like, she's just trying to hide herself.  She's a weirdo.  She's really strange.  She's extremely strange.  She looks good there on the computer, though.  Could you get the clip where she had a, she, there was a, there's a guy on the show that  did a duet with her 10 years ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I don't know what the fuck that's about, but now he's on the X Factor, and he obviously 
[00:21:00]  has had a rough life.  Oh, boy.  And the exchange between the two, because she's like, has to say no to the guy that she  actually did a song with 10 years prior.  What song?  I don't even know.  It was off the first album, but it wasn't a single.  It wasn't a single.  It was just a filler song.  Right.  Is this the clip?  No.  No.  Because that says everything you need to know about Britney and what's going on with  her, because she just looks like she's completely insane.  All right.  You would be creeped out if she was in your house.  You would, you would figure out a way to get her the fuck out of there. 
[00:21:30]  First I fuck off.  Is this it?  No, this is one of those bullshit ones.  Ah, if you can find it for later.  It didn't say rejects ex-duet partner?  Yeah, but it was, uh, see, it's like, it's just a still thing.  They try to get you to go to their shitty website.  Right.  To get the real clip.  But it's not real.  Yeah.  They don't put their clips online?  That's kind of dumb for the X Factor, considering the ratings are, like, a little lower than they  were expecting.  Ratings is shit.  I think we're just about done with award shows, aren't we? 
[00:22:00]  With these, like, fucking type of shows?  I think American Idol's in trouble.  America's Got Talent had a little drop off.  The X Factor, the ratings are down already.  I can't, uh, judge.  The voice is still kicking ass, though.  I can't judge what's going to happen as far as any show goes, as long as Survivor is still  on.  To me, that is the biggest mystery of all.  Could you name one contestant in the last ten years?  No.  And we used to all watch.  We used to have every single one of those guys come through our show. 
[00:22:30]  And I don't know anyone that watches.  Like, I don't even know anyone that goes, that goes, did you watch Survivor?  I've never heard it mentioned by anybody.  I know.  How is it still on?  Yeah, my circle, like, I actually, I have a sister-in-law that's all in with reality  shows.  Yeah.  And, yeah, she doesn't bring it up.  No one does.  She doesn't bring it up.  You wouldn't know it was on until something happens where someone goes, and on Survivor,  you're like, wait, wait, what?  Survivor.  You don't, like, in this new world, you don't see a clip as you're fooling around with your 
[00:23:00]  phone.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You're so right.  Big Brother, too.  Either people are obsessed with it, or have no idea it's happening.  Big Brother, my wife was into, and big time, actually, this year, not even watching at  all.  Just said, eh, done with this.  Did that do well this summer?  It did.  It has that really loyal core audience that, I don't know, it just is not going away.  E-Rock watches Big Brother.  You like Big Brother E-Rock?  No, I actually gave up on it last season.  Oh.  I used to watch it for a long time, but last season, I just had enough of it. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the clip.  So this guy did a duet with Britney Spears 10 years ago, and he's obviously had a rough  fucking life.  I don't know what is going on with this guy.  And I read, too.  I would assume he's got some kind of substance abuse problem, but I don't know.  I read, too, that they edited it out of the TV show for whatever reason.  But he came out on stage to Britney, told her he was gay, and he hadn't told her that 10 
[00:24:00]  years ago, on stage there.  On this show?  Yeah, and they edited it out.  Oh, shit.  So he was all emotional, because he had just been like, I'm gay.  And Britney was like, that's fine.  They want Middle America to watch, and Middle America hates the gay.  Yeah.  Oh, do they hate the gay?  They're not red except the gays.  No, no, no.  Like the coasts are.  Yeah, the coasts love the gay.  You get to the edges, you'll accept the gay.  Anyway, because, you know, if all else fails, I guess you could jump in the ocean and swim  away.  Just leave.  Leave this country.  Escape route. 
[00:24:30]  But they...  Escape route.  In Middle America, you've got to just keep running through people that hate the gay.  You've got to keep just running through cornfields.  Cornfields of people that hate gay.  Oh, man.  So here's the clip, yeah.  He just sang.  Oh.  Okay.  What are you going to sing?  I'm going to sing here.  Great.  Okay, she looks terrible there.  Right?  Yeah.  Horrible, right? 
[00:25:00]  Look at it.  He's like...  Look at his teeth.  He's coked up.  He's doing that teeth thing.  Simon already knows.  Simon's not impressed.  He's the greatest.  I love Simon.  Looks like Jesse from fucking Breaking Bad.  Look at her.  Oh, she looks terrible.  How effective is he? 
[00:25:30]  It's like skinny mustard.  Yes.  They hate him.  They keep showing the judges' faces.  Oh, man.  She looks like shit.  Right?  But more than it looks like shit there, it looks like there's a problem there, right?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I don't see anyone moving in the background.  Yeah, he pumped that shit.  Pumped that shit in. 
[00:26:00]  Simon's like enough.  This is why Simon rules.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Um, thank you, Don.  Oh, Don.  Right.  Look at her.  Oh, she's...  What's wrong with her?  She looks like she wants to bite her fucking fingers off.  Supposed to be a big dramatic moment.  I just have to give you the honest truth.  The problem you have, Don, you don't have a good singing voice.  Ah, ha. 
[00:26:30]  Honestly.  Honestly.  Pretty.  I feel like through the years, maybe you've gone through a lot of hardships and battles.  Ah, yes, yes.  Yes.  But your voice really isn't up to the bar of the standards of the X Factor and what we  want.  Brittany looks like she could be playing Brittany's mother. 
[00:27:00]  Honestly.  Okay.  Yeah, movie.  Have another song.  Oh, boy.  Let's go.  You know when they age Sally Field for, uh, Bar and the Gump.  That's what she looks like.  Yeah.  Ah, ha.  And Brittany.  Look at the weird look she gives.  I'm going to have to say no.  Tell you a story walking.  They're trying to make a sensitive, tender moment here.  You see the guarded position she was in? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  She moves her head back like you might attack.  She just makes weird fucking faces, right, Sam?  She's a weirdo.  Yeah.  Come on right here.  Huh?  Yeah, she makes a good weird face right here.  Yeah.  There.  Oh, my God.  It's just a dumb talent show, you bitch.  If you went back a decade.  Yeah.  Right?  When we had the poster in our office.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A decade.  And you went back in time and were able to take that picture with you and go, dude, this 
[00:28:00]  is Brittany Spears.  You'd be like, get the fuck out of here.  Right.  Doesn't even.  No, I mean.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe.  There it is.  Sure, man.  Ten years have gone by, but she's got, she looks fucking rough.  Her skin looks extremely dry and blotchy.  Hit me, baby, one more time video.  Right.  Oh, man.  What is that all about?  Oh, God.  You're putting them side by side here.  I would venture a guess if you want.  What?  Well.  God, that's hot.  I think if you're on pills for a very long time. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  It really fucks up.  Takes its toll.  Yeah, it fucks up your skin and just fucks up everything.  Her hair doesn't even look like.  No, man.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Looks over bleached.  She looks like she either just had or is about to have a nervous breakdown.  And she's on the X Factor.  I'm telling you, you got to watch because it's really fucking weird and creepy to check  out.  It really looks like she was in hair and makeup and then got frustrated and threw a tantrum 
[00:29:00]  and left halfway through and insisted I'm not going back and did the show anyway.  But no one is acknowledging this.  They're all like, oh, Britney on the X Factor.  Isn't this cool?  It's like, there's something going on here.  What's going on?  I'm going to watch the X Factor all season.  Just for this, right?  Yeah.  Fuck the voice.  Yeah.  I might have to watch this now because of Britney here.  Just to check her out.  Yeah.  We're going to have to keep tabs on this X Factor with Britney Spears.  Then you got the voice.  That's the one.  That's the talent show everyone's talking about.  I refuse the voice.  And Roland was all about it. 
[00:29:30]  You know why?  Because he's got a crush on Blake Shelton.  That's why.  But is Roland...  I don't know.  He's always talking about Blake Shelton.  Oh, boy.  Roland is not...  He talks about Blake Shelton a lot.  Maroon 5 guy?  No, the country artist.  Roland is...  You know, he's not that way, Sam Roberts.  I know.  Maybe he's just got...  He's just attracted to women and Blake Shelton.  Do you remember when Blake was here?  Roland stood in the lobby, I think, for an hour and a half.  Just waiting for Blake to be finished.  Roland is in early. 
[00:30:00]  Roland.  You got to defend yourself.  What is that?  What is this?  Why do you have a giant Walking Dead plot?  A Walking Dead complete second season limited edition with a zombie.  The head inside.  But that's huge.  I know.  Since Anthony talked about it, they sent...  But why is it so big?  Because it's...  Because there's a head in there.  It's like a limited edition head thing.  Oh, it's the actual head.  It's a little thing you put the case in, and it's a head with a screwdriver through the  eye.  How big is that box?  It scares me.  Very big.  The size of a head. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, true.  It scares me.  It's like the size of a hat box.  You looking upon it or sell it?  Yeah.  But you got DVDs in there, too?  Yeah, they're saying more Blu-rays.  Nice.  Roland.  Yes.  I'm going to just say one name.  Were you listening to the show?  No.  I just got in.  We were talking about the voice.  You love the voice, right?  I love the voice.  I just want to say one thing.  Blake Shelton.  Ooh, Honeybee.  Honeybee?  Yeah, I love this music.  I guess there's concerts. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, boy.  No, they say that you're in love with the guy.  I said he has a little crush on Blake Shelton.  Do you have a crush on Blake Shelton?  Well, when I met him, he goes, I love you, man.  I go, well, I love you too there, fella.  Fella?  Yeah, he goes, I love you, man.  He's so good.  Oh, he has a song called Honeybee.  Yeah.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  I thought you were saying, ooh, Honeybee.  I thought you were saying, ooh, Honeybee.  Like you're a little pet name for him.  Right.  No, but he's really good, though.  How can you tell?  It's country music.  He's funny.  His tweets are hilarious.  But how can you tell he's really good? 
[00:31:30]  He's good.  I'll listen to country music from time to time, but I don't really understand what makes one  country music song better than the other.  The words, man.  It's all about the story they're telling.  Country stories are stupid.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're funny.  Yeah, they're dumb.  Guns, about poo.  Yeah, they're just about fucking breaking up.  The sad ones are the breaking up with the girl.  Yeah.  Or somebody dying.  Or the military.  And then the happy ones are you're at the bar, you're partying and dancing, doing that  dumb country, click your heels on the ground dance thing. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Or your red cello cup.  They have a cup.  I know what he said.  I don't know.  There was a huge, you want me to explain?  Please interpret.  He's referring to a song that was really huge.  Was it this past summer or was that a year already?  And it's a song about the red cup.  It's the worst song ever made.  Oh, like a party cup?  That party cup?  You get the red cup for the keg?  Yeah.  Tell us about it.  I hear it. 
[00:32:30]  This is it.  This was a massive hit in the country music world.  Pop Ford and Stations plays this.  Hits One played it.  Now, Red Solo Cup is the best receptacle for barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals.  And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles if you prefer drinking from glass.  Hey, Red Solo Cup is cheap and disposable.  For 14 years, they are decomposable.  And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable.  Freddie Mac can kiss my ass.  Wait for the hook. 
[00:33:00]  Red Solo Cup.  Uh-huh.  This is like something from Country Bear Jamboree at Disney.  They just, the guy looked at the cup and was like, god damn these Red Solo cups.  Toby Keith was like, well, my audience are all morons.  Yeah.  So I'm going to write the stupidest song I can as a goof.  And sing.  And they'll all buy it.  Yeah, I bet you it's one big joke with his people.  Like, look, watch. 
[00:33:30]  This is how dumb these assholes are.  He thinks his listeners are assholes.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, Ann.  What does this sound like?  It's one of those little talkie songs.  It's one of those little talkie songs, right.  Well, it's like, it's like, it's like the Arlo Guthrie.  Yeah.  Hot Rod Lincoln.  Hot Rod Lincoln a little bit.  Yes.  The Johnny Cash one.  I got it one piece at a time.  Yeah.  And it didn't cost me a dime.  It's a story song.  We did a whole bit on story songs. 
[00:34:00]  It's a story song.  I think you might be right with Hot Rod Lincoln.  Yeah, yeah.  Alice's Restaurant, all that shit, yeah.  How could his audience not think to themselves,  I believe he's starting to insult our intelligence.  Yeah, now he's, now I think he's making fun of us.  Yeah.  But, Ann, there was a time you were in a band,  trying to make it, played in a lot of bands.  Yeah.  Does this piss you off that something like this is a hit?  That actually makes it. 
[00:34:30]  All you had to do was pick up that stupid cup you were drinking out of.  Yeah.  Yeah, just pick up the cup and start writing about it.  Yeah.  Come on, Red Solo Cup.  I'm so fucked up.  Friends.  Yeah.  Lifelong.  Thank you for being my friend.  Red Solo Cup.  I feel you up.  I thought that was the end of the song.  No.  This got.  You've still got a minute and a half.  This.  It's kind of catchy.  This was popular. 
[00:35:00]  Huge.  This was a huge hit.  I hate it.  Of course you do.  I mean, it angers me.  He walked around the Grammy scene with Red Solo Cup.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Would you like to know a little bit about this song?  Not really.  Well, we're going to, anyway.  Just to kill a minute.  All right.  If you don't mind.  Chris in Ohio.  Chris.  Hey, fellas.  How's it going this morning?  Oh, we're doing good, man.  Hey, Doug.  Thanks for asking.  Red Solo Cup was written.  Toby Hughes said, hey, I can write a song about anything.  And someone gave him a Red Solo Cup and said, here, write a song about this. 
[00:35:30]  And voila, you have Red Solo Cup.  Why it went as big as it did, I have no idea why it did that.  Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.  I could also write a song about anything.  I could write a song about anything.  But it would be shitty.  But see, I get why it's a hit.  Really?  I don't.  Yeah, it's one of those fucking novelty songs.  We all grew up with novelty songs.  It's a novelty song.  They just don't do them as much these days.  Well, you guys have a great day.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  What was your best novelty song there, Ant?  Back in the day?  Yeah.  What were some of the novelty songs?  Well, you had all those dumb fucking ones with the...  Dickie Goodman?  Dickie Goodman.  But that wasn't really a song song.  Right.  Well, you got to go with...  What's his name?  The Streak?  Ray Stevens?  Yeah, yeah.  What was the other one with the Tarzan wine?  Ray Stevens had a few.  Oh, God.  They were so bad.  I'm going to go with... 
[00:36:30]  Guitarzan.  Guitarzan!  He's a jungle man.  I don't remember that.  Oh, it's terrible.  Dude, you definitely would remember it.  Can you play that?  Play a little Guitarzan.  Oh, wait.  Live version.  Always the live version.  Always the live version.  We don't want to hear the people laughing.  Oh, they're both live versions.  Oh, that's it?  Oh, wow.  Whatever.  Oh, this is racist.  He's free as the breeze. 
[00:37:00]  He's always at ease.  He lives in the jungle and hangs by his knees.  As he swings to the trees without a crapeze.  In his BVD.  Oh, the people laughing.  Play the guitar.  Gonna be a big star.  The 70s mustache.  Isn't that proud?  I don't know this one.  What?  Wait until it kicks in. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, boy.  He's all you can stand.  Give him a hand.  Guitar's aid.  You stumped me.  I don't know this.  Yeah?  You stumped me.  All right, enough of this.  This is so bad.  This is one of those big Dr. Demento hits.  Yeah, Dr. Demento played all this shit.  All the novelty songs.  Oh. 
[00:38:00]  I was a big fan of Dr. Demento when I was in high school.  We used to exchange tapes and shit.  Hey, Dr. Demento is on.  Let's listen.  Did you work for me, Rock?  Yeah.  I don't think local radio, my local radio stations had the Dr. Demento show, so I think we got  it from elsewhere.  And it was so.  Yeah.  It was such a cool thing when someone would show up at high school with the Dr. Demento  cassette.  Who the fuck was Dr. Demento?  I'm embarrassed now to say this.  Who was he?  He's just some California DJ.  Yeah, I would assume he's just a DJ that went, you know what?  There's a lot of weird songs out there. 
[00:38:30]  But he could be like, he was probably walking around like, hey, by the way, I'm Dr. Demento.  Of course.  You wore the hat and everything.  Get the fuck out of here.  You wore a top hat and a bow tie.  Yeah, the red bow tie.  But he was on radio.  Yeah, but you know, he realized this is horseshit, this business, so maybe I could do something  a little different with it.  Look at, oh my God, what's he in front of?  What was it?  The funny five at five.  I can't do his voice.  Oh, that's old though.  He's already old there.  Well, he started in the, he's probably still doing it, right?  I don't think he's.  Oh my God. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, Dr. Demento songs.  Yikes.  That's where Weird Al became famous.  Oh, well, yes.  Weird Al played a lot.  He has to thank Dr. Demento.  The Dr. Demento.  And the rapping Duke, your favorite.  Oh my God.  That was another one.  Da, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, that's a novelty song.  And another song he used to talk about, The Curly Shuffle.  Curly Shuffle, another novelty song.  So you can understand the Red Cup song.  Bob and Doug McKenzie, right?  I'm looking down here at my screen. 
[00:39:30]  Now they just don't attempt novelty songs like that anymore.  Except for Red Solo Cup.  Do you remember, I think it was Popcorn by Hot Butter?  Oh, yeah.  You got that one?  Hang on.  This was a hit.  This was a hit.  Yeah.  A hit.  This was a hit.  You turned on your radio.  This was on.  Yes.  So annoying.  Ronnie B loves the Popcorn song.  Oh, does he?  I love this song. 
[00:40:00]  Ron does it when he talks about blockbuster movies for the summer.  I love Ronnie B.  By the way, it doesn't get much better than this.  This is the song right here.  This was huge.  This was a big hit.  So, of course, the Red Cup song.  Why did people like this?  Why did people like this?  Because it sounds like popcorn.  Do they have a follow-up hit?  Or a follow-up song, even?  The reason it's.  Turns out, man.  I like this. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, now it's kind of kicking in.  Yeah, you've got to have it kick in.  Sounds like Convoy now.  Oh, yeah.  Convoy's another.  Yeah, it's got that snare drum behind it now.  No, there's nothing else in the system by Hot Butter.  Hot Butter.  Was the band Hot Butter?  Yeah.  They did a song called Popcorn.  That's it.  That's it.  You know that's all you're getting.  Imagine you get a band together like, all right, I got it.  I got an idea.  We're going to call ourselves Hot Butter. 
[00:41:00]  Our first single is going to be Popcorn.  Oh, cool.  But where do you go from there?  What else could Hot Butter do?  It was before we had different flavors of popcorn.  Yeah.  So they're fucked.  Yeah, you might have been able to do Cheddar Popcorn.  Right, right.  Yeah.  White Cheddar Popcorn.  Oh, yeah.  This is terrible.  Toast.  They should have done a song called Toast.  That was pretty funny.  Could call Crab Legs, Lobster Tails. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, you know.  Oh, come on.  Hot Butter could have done a lot.  Did they even try?  Is there a Wikipedia page for Hot Butter?  Hot Butter.  Oh, they went with Percolator, Ed.  No way.  Turn yours down, Iraq.  This is Hot Butter Percolator.  Yes.  This is their follow-up single.  Oh, my God.  It's going to be the same thing.  Oh, boy.  It's called Percolator.  All right.  Ha!  My fucking ass世. 
[00:42:00]  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  What idiots!  Ha!  That stinks!  Ha!  There's Wanna Tree Pony's!  I like them.  You've got to admit, it's catchy.  It's not quite popcorn, but a Percolator.  And then they have another one  It's called Anal Beans  The sound of Anal Beans being pulled out of your rectum 
[00:42:30]  Ha ha  Noises  Hey man you want to see Hot Butter  They're playing in the Beacon Theater  The bar with your mom's car  Dude they opened with percolator  And they fucking closed with popcorn  And their encore of course  You think the encore is going to be popcorn  I think the encore is going to be popcorn  Yeah  What else did they have  They do a song called Rolling Boil  You're kidding  Well I don't even know that's the sad part

[00:48:30]  But then I saw Britney Spears  And went holy fuck  What's wrong with this broad  And that's all I'm doing with this show  Well she does look a little beaten down  That's what Bonnie said  Beaten down  She looks like  We said all this a half hour ago  But she looks like she's ready to have a nervous breakdown  At any moment  I think she carries herself as a star  I like her  I like her  Yeah  Really  So what's up with the mother-daughter  They did something  Well there was a lot of produced stuff  Didn't you see the part where the guy came out  Remember the part where I said  I'm not really watching the show 
[00:49:00]  Okay well  I want to reiterate that  Let me try  Okay  I've seen two things  Alright I'll tell you what I've seen on X Factor  So we could like  Then you know what I've seen  And then you could maybe explain what I didn't see  Okay  Britney Spears is a mess  Looks like she might be on some kind of substance  And looks like she might have a nervous breakdown at any moment  And she needs plastic surgery badly  Okay  Then I saw  The guy who sang with her ten years ago  Okay  Alright hold on  And I did see one other thing  Some broad who's 13 
[00:49:30]  Who sang her balls off last night  She was fucking amazing  Did you hear  Did you see her or hear her  No  Amazing  Ridiculous  It was insane  It's too bad she's a little funny looking  That means she's never going to make it  Black broad or a white broad  White broad  Get the white broad from last night  She sang her  She was amazing  Because Anthony's a tough critic  When it comes to singing and stuff  Exactly  That broad right there  But Anthony's not a tough critic  When it comes to 13 year olds  Fucking rich  This is from last night  A little funny looking  I'm not going to lie to you  Hey guys my name is Carly Rose 
[00:50:00]  Wait till you hear her sing  I'm 18 years old  And I'm from Westchester, New York  Oh she's local  Westchester  She's local Sam  Alright  I don't even know  What was going on in my head  How about you go full screen  Jesus how many times  How about we get right to the singer  I don't give a fuck about her backstory  What  That's what I was trying to say  This is not the video of her singing  Ah  What  Where's the video of her singing  How is it not her singing  Find it  Yeah please  What do you fucking  What do you do here  How about you just put her fucking name  In YouTube 
[00:50:30]  And I bet it pops up  Holla  Okay so the guy you saw  That sang with Britney  Yeah  You don't think that was produced  Do you  I mean he's got to be a great actor  But  Well obviously  What are the odds  They already know he has a horrible voice  But they're like  This will make a good fucking story for our show  So it's produced  Of course  Okay  Second of all  I'm sick of people coming out  And the one girl goes  I was bullied  Well there's nothing  First of all you two are bullies  But there's nothing  You know there was nothing wrong  With a girl that said  I was bullied  She looked okay 
[00:51:00]  She seemed normal  Just because we're smarter than you  You call us bullies  What's that  Just because we're smarter than you  You call us bullies  I'm sick of everybody saying the bully  Using the bully card  Yeah  Because this girl  She sang alright  She came out  She was crying  Anthony here's the girl from my life  Oh hold on  Hold on  Wait till you hear this  Thirteen  Simon's like  Oh  Wait  This has potential  What? 
[00:51:30]  What?  I'll let you read  What?  What?  So  You're gonna kick it in?  Yeah  That's when  You get the chills  It's a new life  For me  I feel  Try to fly out in the sun 
[00:52:00]  You know  Tell me  Don't you know  What a fly  It's all that happens  And you know  What I mean  Yeah  She's really good  Thirteen  My kids can't fry eggs  At twenty-two  And this whole world  Is a new world  And a bold world  For me  And I'm feeling good  She's got a nice ass  Not bad right?  We don't do the whole thing  But  People will be talking about her 
[00:52:30]  For the next few days  She's gonna be a star  Did you say nice ass?  You can tell  She does  She's got a nice ass  She's gonna be cute  She's gonna be cute  She is funny looking  No she's not  She's a little funny looking  Rich  She's a little funny looking  Well a girl came out  And said  I was bullied  The whole bully thing  Like  She had the same tattoo  As the judge  That was supposedly bullied  Okay  And she was crying  I was bullied  You know what?  There's nothing wrong with you  So if you were bullied  I mean  There's nothing wrong with you 
[00:53:00]  There's people sitting  In fucking wheelchairs  Going  Oh really?  You were bullied?  You know  I had to cook a cat  So my little sister could eat  Because my fucking parents  Took off on me  All right  You were bullied  You've got all your limbs  You look okay  What the fuck did you do?  That's the society we're living in today  Rich  What did she do to get bullied?  Everyone's bullied  What kind of bullying?  Everyone had a big problem  What kind of bullying?  I don't know  She's crying  I said  I was bullied  And her song was  We could feel your pain  Let it fucking go  Okay?  Jesus  Wow Rich 
[00:53:30]  You're taking the sex factor  A little too seriously  I fucking love these shows  It's garbage entertainment  It's just like  Fucking throw away entertainment  Who cares?  No sometimes you find  Some great singers  That girl  Was amazing to watch  It's just like  Everyone's got their problems  Then dummy  Then dummy's like  Rich take it seriously  I'm just  Enough with the bullying  I fucking  PR came up with the bullying  Bit rich  Calm down  Ooh PR  Yeah  Oh 
[00:54:00]  I want your  Oh wait  I think we did this last time  And you were  You were too chicken  What?  I want your honest opinion  On something  Who?  Tom Cotter?  Yes  What's my honest opinion?  He was the runner up  Last night  On that  America's Got Talent  So it's between him  And another guy  And a dog act  And the dog act won  So he got kicked off?  Well he  No  He was the runner up  Which is pretty impressive  For the show  So he took second place?  Took second place  For the whole fucking show  That's great  Good for him  Here's what 
[00:54:30]  You want my  Honest truly opinion  I think  You want me to start this  So you feel a little better  About killing him?  No I can tell you  Because he's a friend  I'm not going to kill him  Because  He's a good road comic  What he  It's not a road comic  What he does  He does well  And I said that before  That type of comedy  The one liners  The misdirection  He does well  My point is  He's nothing special  To be the runner up  Of America's Got Talent  There's a lot of guys  That do our show  That are way the fuck better 
[00:55:00]  You're right  But do you think  Do you think  Any one of the comics  From this show  DePaulo  Or Bobby Kelly  Or anybody  Could go on there  With their abrasive  Politically  Of course not  Of course not  So for that show  And what he does  He's perfect for it  I guess  I don't think  He should have went  As far as he went  Is what I'm saying  What's that?  He shouldn't have went  As far as he went  He almost won  A spot in Vegas 
[00:55:30]  For a million dollars  Good for him  Is he a million dollar act?  For what?  But  Well they said no  Last night  You know what  You could go throughout  The whole entertainment business  And say  Is this person  You know  You know  This fucking clown  That usually sits next to me here  You know  Made a career out of  Slipping in a puddle of AIDS  Okay  To some people  That's guys  Ridiculous  Alright  I think he's funny  But most people  Would look at him  And go  One he's hard to look at  I'm talking about  North  Two  Two  He's not here  To defend himself  I don't give a fuck  They all trash me 
[00:56:00]  When I'm not here  I'm just saying  He's my  I like him  I like that kind of comedy  If 80% of the Americans  Listened to Colin Quinn  And could figure out  What the fuck  He was saying  They'd go  He's brilliant  But he's a mumbling douchebag  That won't slow the fuck down  And is a self-sabotaging asshole  Now if you look at Bobby Kelly  And you look at him on stage  You go  Well he's gonna explode  John Panette did what he's doing already  Lose some fucking weight  And be funny  But he's great 
[00:56:30]  I'm a fan of his  Joe DeRosa  You look at him  And go  The guy's gonna swallow a bullet  He'll find something wrong  He's depressed  Okay we don't need  We came in here  To  To  To  To  To get away  From our problems  And leave happy  And we gotta listen to your  Fucking  Quay-loo  Depression comedy  Oh man  Wow  Joe DeRosa  I like them all  They're all my type of comedy  Okay  Sounds like you like them  No I'm just saying  None of that is right for  America's Got Talent 
[00:57:00]  They like all these stupid  Fucking  Milk-toasty acts  No I get that  I get that part of it  Yeah  Yeah well it's  All the TV likes bullshit  Do you believe the Middle East  Is blowing up  And we're talking about  Fucking  These talent shows  Isn't that amazing  We are truly  A nation of idiots  No you're  Morning radio  Yeah that's true  No we're just assholes  We're assholes  Huh  We're just assholes  So Tom Cotter  I was hoping he would win  One  I know him  I know his wife  You know 
[00:57:30]  And he is what he is  My  For what he does  He's a 10  At what he does  See you proved my point  He is what he is  Yeah but  Okay look  You can take any band  That's great  And go  Oh they stink  To you  That doesn't mean  They stink  That's your opinion  That's what I hate  I didn't say he stinks  You're saying  You don't like him  No  Oh his type of comedy  No  Okay  I would walk past  The  You know 
[00:58:00]  Okay so you're  His brand  Yeah I don't know  But I understand  That it's good  And he's  But you're saying  Your arrogancy  Is saying  My opinion  No man  Arrogance  These judges  On that show  Are doting over him  Like he was  You know  An amazing comic  He's just an  Okay good  Solid road comic  That's all I'm trying to say  And he almost won the show  That's ridiculous  And that's another  Here's another  Misconception about comedy  When they go road comic  Conception-y  You know what I mean  A guy that's been 
[00:58:30]  Like just doing it  A long fucking time  He's been at it  For 20 some odd years  And now all of a sudden  He's special  No I don't think so  He is what he is  Well some people  Take 20 years  To be discovered  The business proved  Said a long time ago  You're just a good  Solid average  Road comic  That's what you'll be doing  For the rest of your life  But the best  But then he got this shot  On the show  And now  The best comics  On the planet  Are road comics  That's where they make  Their money  On the road  They go  They're road comics  So to call someone  A road comic  Is an insult  To you guys  No it's  A misconception  That's just what we need 
[00:59:00]  Rich talking is bad enough  Now he's talking  With his mouth full of food  I guess what I'm saying  Is like  Oh my god  A lot of you guys  Are on the road  Constantly making your money  Right  Yes  But you also get to do  Other things  Yes  I've never seen him  Get to do another thing  He's done some stuff  He's done  He's done  I know the name  We've said no to him  What's that  I know the name  We've said no to him  Over the years  You did  Yeah  Well because he doesn't  Fit in with the gel here  But I'm sure he's perfect 
[00:59:30]  On like a Bob and Tom  Oh I'm sure  You know or whatever  You guys have the  To me  The best comics  And the edgiest comics  And that's what you like  That's my point  Okay so you like edgy comedy  What's your favorite car  I like some clean guys too  What's your favorite car  I like Brian Regan  He's not an edgy comic  By any stretch  Well when the mics are off  He's pretty edgy  He's a lunatic  He's at a whole nother level  Of funny Brian Regan  You know I mean  Even though he's clean  He's a great example  Brian Regan would  Destroy Tom Cotter 
[01:00:00]  And they're in the same world  Clean  Fucking  You can bring your family  To their fucking set  And Brian Regan  And it would be a joke  If you saw those two guys  Side by side  Jim Gaffigan  Thank you  You're right  So would he  We can make the list  But they're talking like  This guy is the best comic  In America  And I think it's an insult  To you guys  Is what I'm saying  No  All those shows  Are insults  I lost to a fucking  Delivery boy  On last comic  Okay  What does that say  It means nothing  Okay  My point  So  For your business 
[01:00:30]  It's an insult  That they  They almost  Gave him the fucking title  Last night  Because there's so many guys  Better  Look at these acts  In Vegas  Say someone  Who passed away  Danny Games  Or one of them  These guys are doing magic  Making  50 million a year  Yeah  For doing fucking tricks  That  Amazing Jonathan  Can do  Or  You know what I mean  So  The marketplace  Determines  How good you are  That's all  It determines  The marketplace  Determines how good you are  Yes  Yes 
[01:01:00]  Because if you're not making  If people aren't coming to see you  Oh  The marketplace determines  The marketplace determines  How much money you guys  Doesn't make you good though  Yeah  It does to them  Because the audience  Listen  When I did Last Comic Standing  After that  I was selling out theaters  Clubs  Packed  Right  But then those people  Came and saw me  And go  This guy's a real scumbag  This is not what he was doing  On Last Comic  Why didn't you adjust your act  For a little while  Why should I do that  I'm going to be true  Just to keep the money coming in 
[01:01:30]  Oh right  Yeah really  I'm going to be true to myself  Why didn't you guys  You know  Oh you're one of those guys  I'm going to be true to myself  Okay  Let's have a big hand  For the ladies  Oh you're just being a hack  Fucking  No I wasn't being a hack  I was being a creep  No that would be great  If you had to like  Change your act  Yeah  You were all nice rich  You ever notice  When your wife walks in late  And you don't accuse her  I saw that happen  To Bob Saget too  When Bob Saget hit the road  Uh huh  And all those fucking  What show was he on again 
[01:02:00]  I forgot the name  Of the fucking show  Full House  Full House  Thank you  All the Full House people went  And they were shocked  At what they were seeing  Because everyone knows  Bob Saget has always been known  As a really filthy comic  Well same thing happened to Rosie  During her show  When she had that thing  Right  And she would go on stage  And these old ladies  Going oh my god  This is not what  I came to see the woman  From the TV show  And she's very nasty  The one that's in love  With Tom Cruise  Right  Why doesn't she say  Cutie patootie 
[01:02:30]  On the stage  I think she might be  A carpet monster  She might like  The vaginas  She doesn't give that impression  When she's talking  About Tom Cruise  My goodness  Not the one that's  Running like a bull  With her head  Into a pussy  You gotta think  She's an aggressive one  Too  Right  That Rosie  Oh my god  She's gotta be  Oh my god  That Rosie  I'm a fan of Rosie  I bet she's a moaner  Like that  With a mouth full of muff 
[01:03:00]  Just  I was about to say  I like her too  I don't even know  If that's true  I'll tell you why  I'm a fan of her  Do I like her too  I don't think I like her  I think I liked her  I liked her  Because you tweeted me once  Here's why  That's all it takes with me  You tweet me  I'm a big fan of yours  I'll give you three reasons  One when she had her show  She only used three comics  And I was one of them  Two  What show  When she had Rosie  The actual Rosie show  Yeah  You were on the actual Rosie show  Yeah I was like the third  Get me a clip of fucking  Rich Voss on the Rosie show  Find it  Then  The one where  Selleck and  Cruise 
[01:03:30]  And she  Yeah  I did the view three times too  Ah whatever  The view is sick  But anyhow  Hope you enjoy this  Okay so  But you want to be true to yourself  Really  Oh so I'm going to turn down  Rosie's show  You just made my point  What  Holy fuck  You just made my point  No you still  I said why didn't you  Like adjust your act  After you got that  But I still was as edgy  As I could be for her show  But the view and all that  That's like  I was very edgy on the view  No I was very edgy on the view  Okay  And Joey Behar 
[01:04:00]  Is a fan of mine  I'm a fan of hers  So  Rosie was in our movie  And after Rosie  Left her show  She went after  Clinton  Michael Jackson  Clinton  She didn't hold back  Clinton  I said Clinton  Ah you said Clinton  Clinton  That's okay  I just  I just pick these things up  Okay  Alright cause you're bullies  No  How are we bullies  Because you pronounce  Clinton Clinton  Because maybe I have a handicap  Oh  You're eating an egg sandwich  Doesn't  Oh my god  Doesn't help matters 
[01:04:30]  Wow  You know  We're not bullies  Why are you obsessed  With us being bullies  I'm just using  We challenge you  I'm using the bully  We're trying to  Have you live your game  Huh  We're trying to make you  Because if people  Start feeling sorry  They'll come out to my shows  Oh he  Bullied  They bullied you  Can't find it huh  Yeah you are not Rosie  I was fucking on Rosie  Everything's on the internet  Rich  I'll bring the clip  Everything's on the internet  Not even a photo  Not even a photo  That's how much she cared about you  She was nice to my kids 
[01:05:00]  She didn't put it on  When they were young  Was she supposed to eat them  Well  They were young  She gave them toys  You know how  It's easy to be nice to someone's kids  For two minutes when you see them  What do you expect her to do  Throw them up against a wall  I'll never forgive her  For blindsiding Tom Selleck  On the gun issue  The gun issue  Meanwhile her bodyguards have  They carry guns  Yeah  That's like really  Oh so you  What about people that can't afford  Armed bodyguards  You want to prevent them 
[01:05:30]  From protecting themselves  And the way they think  Is the best way  Sure  To protect themselves  Rosie  But I was  When she attacked Michael Jackson  Which nobody was  Or Bill Clinton  Right  After  You know  What show is this Rich Voss  Comics Unleashed  With Byron Allen  Oh this is so bad  Byron Allen  Oh this is so  Byron Allen  I don't like Byron Allen  It's so bad  So you just got back  From Afghanistan  You were raped  Okay  Everything  Everything is set up  It's the worst  I don't like Byron Allen 
[01:06:00]  I never got him either  You like Byron Allen  As a comic  See I can't ask Rich  This shit  Now Rich will always say  See what's weird  Like comics will protect  Each other  Radio guys  Fuck that  You know who didn't  We don't fucking  Protect each other  Like you guys do  Protecting comics  Is Patrice  Right exactly  Patrice didn't like  A comic  He stinks  Oh man he'd have  A lot to say  About Tom Cotter  And in his place  You should say  The same shit  It stinks  That motherfucker  It stinks  Anthony is correct 
[01:06:30]  But here's the thing  Patrice was great  He was probably  The best comic  In the business  Yeah  But that's his  That's his dumb opinion  That's his opinion  There's ten other people  That would go  I know but  For some weird reason  When Patrice had an opinion  Wow  You didn't think  He hit a nerve  With a lot of people  Where people were like  Holy fuck  You're so right  I know stand up comedy  Is subjective  And stuff like that  And some people  Find some things funny  And others won't  But you don't think  There are some comics  That just aren't good at it 
[01:07:00]  Yes  Yeah  So that you could  You could be talking  About that  And then someone  Would go  Well that's your opinion  And it's like  No  They suck  And it's like  A band also  I don't like their music  I don't like them  But they're talented  And then there's just  Bands that suck  But look  There was a million people  Who said  G.W. Bush was stupid  He's stupid  But you can't be stupid  To become a president  Well right  Okay  You have  There's something  That's got to be smart  To get to that level  In politics  Okay  Okay  So when people say 
[01:07:30]  Well that guy stinks  Or that girl  You know how many people  Think Larry the Cable guy  Is the fucking worst  Okay  But to get to his level  And to do what he did  To go around the business  A character  Okay  A character  All right  Dice is a character  He's a fucking gimmick  All right  Dice is a gimmick  You don't think  He's a character  I think  He's beyond funny though  He's a character though  Do you think that character  It's not really  He came on stage  Do you think it would be  Funny if he came out  As a regular person  It's hard to describe Dice 
[01:08:00]  I understand like  He does his act  As a character  But he's fucking  One of the funniest  Human beings  I've ever met  Yeah  On and off stage  And there's not much  Difference on and off stage  But off stage  He's using his character too  Right  I'm not saying he's not funny  But he's a character  I guess when you say character  It kind of like  Lowers the bar usually  It's easy to get away  With things  When you're a character  Otto  Otto with the dummy  Couldn't get away  With half of his stuff  Because he has the dummy  All right  You know  What's your character 
[01:08:30]  Huh  What's your character  A guy that's been bullied  Throughout the radio  History of this show  I don't have a character  I'm me  I'm me  I don't even  But see  You do it to yourself  Because now we can make fun  Of what you just said  Because I don't know  What you just said  What's my character  I'm me  I just go on  I'm me  Louis C.K. doesn't have a character  Louis C.K. would absolutely say  Tom Cotter is average at best  Now  Thank you  Woody  Woody?  I don't know  Oh maybe not 
[01:09:00]  I don't know  I don't think  Jay Moore would  I love Jay Moore  Louis might not I guess  Louis is pretty good to the comics  I think he actually tweeted  Good luck to the guy  So I have to take that back  They're both on Boston  I don't hate the guy  I'm just saying  For a big huge show  That's getting  At times  8-9 million fucking viewers  There's better shit  To put up on that stage  That's all  That's my whole point  Yeah  That's  That's 
[01:09:30]  On all the shows  There's better stuff  To put up  On Project Runway  I'm sure there's much better  Designers than they have  This year  On fucking  Top Chef  This year  This year  You watch Project Runway  Really?  Every year  Why?  Because  I couldn't even tell you  The first thing about it  Do you want me to tell you?  I watch  Rich loves junk TV  Yeah  No I don't  I watch Project Runway  Top Chef  Okay  That's junk TV so far 
[01:10:00]  No  Top Chef  No  The reason is  I'll tell you why it's good  Rich hold on  I gotta stop you again  Cause you just are convinced  That me and Andrews bully you  You make it so easy  I say something  So simple  You love junk TV  And then you give me  Two examples of junk TV  And then say  It's not junk TV  I'll tell you why  Because when you watch  Like X Factor  Or even when  Last comic was on  None of these shows  Do they trash each other  They're nice  They're  Yeah 
[01:10:30]  Okay  The judging shows  Trash  No I'm talking about  The contestants  Don't trash each other  Okay  On Top Chef  And on Project Runway  They attack each other  And I like that  I like when people  Are honest  And go  That person  Is a fucking  Horrible  Designer  Okay  You watch  Any sports interview  When an athlete  Leaves a team  Even with a coach  He hated  Then he never  They're never gonna  Say the truth  They never go  Well you know  He sucked 
[01:11:00]  They don't do it  Yeah  But these  On these shows  Maybe because  On Project Runway  It leans a little more  Towards  Gay  Gay clientele  Or gay  A little  Gay care  And maybe they're more honest  Gay care  Gay cast  But it sounded like  Gay care  You're right  Okay  That's exciting  What I like about these shows  That could be an interesting concept  Gay care center  Drop your friend off  At gay care  So they  They're honest  At least on the show  I think we had a bit there  Rich 
[01:11:30]  I think we could go  With the gay care thing  Okay  Well there's another  Little morning bit  For you guys  Hey  It's Thursday  And it's time  For gay care  Gay care  You don't even know  What day it is  I know  I'm saying it's gonna be  On Thursdays  Oh okay  He's picking the day  The bit will be  Yeah  That makes sense  So six days from now  We'll do the bit  That we're doing right now  Gay care  Okay  Yeah we don't bully  What were you saying  Okay  So  All right  So it's  Trash TV  Is housewives 
[01:12:00]  It's  You know  Kardashians  That's all bullshit TV  But Project Runway  It's bullshit TV  No you're learning  About designing  What do they call it  You're learning about designing  What do they call it  What's the word  Educational  What  Assisted reality  Assisted reality  They're all just junk TV  But you're learning  About  You're learning  When you watch  Top Chef  You're learning  About cooking  You're learning  All right Rich  What have you learned  From Top Chef  Top Chef  Well one of the things is

[01:29:30]  That'll be $120  I got health insurance  Yeah I know  That's the copay  Really  What the fuck is that about  They just need pocket money  Yeah yeah  They need that petty cash  For the office  Petty cash  I think it was Russ Meneve  Have you ever had him in here  Like Russ Meneve  Funny  I think it was him  But he used to do a bit  About the payment  The copayment  When you went  Into the doctor  Right  And it was just some doctor  That was hungry  And didn't have lunch money  Right  And that's how it started  Right  They just thought  It was a copay 
[01:30:00]  10 bucks  Yeah  I gotta get a subway sandwich  Get five bucks from him  So we need  Yeah we need five dollars  It was either him or Correale  One of the two  That drives me nuts  I'd rather them bill me  And I swear to you  I'd rather they bill me  For a hundred dollars  That I never see  Than going  Okay your copay today  Is $15  They need their cash  Really?  $15?  They love the cash  How much of that  Do you think  They actually fucking claim?  Oh cause they give you  That fake receipt  Where they write it out themselves  And you're always giving cash 
[01:30:30]  Really?  I always just go  Ah forget the receipt  Right  What am I going to do  With the receipt?  I don't want the receipt  Do we have the Russman Eve bit?  I don't know if it's him  Why is E-Rock on a phone?  Like an actual phone  That was weird  Ordering pizza?  E-Rock why were you  On like a house phone?  I was trying to call  Roland in the back  For what reason?  Pizza  For what reason?  Not for pizza  What a lunch thing?  For what reason?  No  Something to eat  What guests that we have  Coming at 9.30  Chef?  Who? 
[01:31:00]  What'd you have to ask him?  Breakfast?  Hello?  Seeing how many people  Were coming in  With our guests at 9.30  Who's coming at 9.30?  Why would that matter?  Who's coming in at 9.30?  J.J. Abrams  Oh okay  But why would it matter  How many people he's bringing?  Is he a fucking  He put them all in here  I'm lying  This is not honest  Sam  You were on the  Because he gets mad at me  Way too quickly  So I'll give it to Sam  Why would you ask  How many people  That's not a question  Anyone would ask  How many people 
[01:31:30]  Are going to be with  J.J. Abrams  Because you don't get  All the other people  That get stuck in this studio  It does seem mysterious  That he's making a phone call  To say  Hey how many people  Are going to be standing  Next to me  In an hour and a half  What difference does it make?  And if you are asking that  That's just a waste of time  Roland  You were on the phone  With E-Rock  You were on the phone  With E-Rock  No we didn't pick up  No I walked by  But I think I know why  Okay  Why?  Because there's a poster  Next to my desk  To get signed  Oh  Come on E-Rock 
[01:32:00]  There is no loyalty  In this building  No  They just fucking  Well snitched  We've got to fill  Four hours man  We have to do this shit  But it doesn't matter  How many people  Who's with them  Right that makes  A lot more sense  What Roland said  E-Rock comment  E-Rock  No it wasn't about that  It was absolutely  You called  Saying  I want my poster  He was saying  How many people  Will be standing  Around the poster  That can get him  To sign  Right  E-Rock  Let me go with  A very simple question  Why would you ask 
[01:32:30]  Roland that?  Because I also have  Other people coming  Around the same time  So I was going to  Make sure I had room  In here  It had nothing to do  With anything  You guys were talking about  What other people there  E-Rock  Cowhead stopping by  To say hi  Did he?  Yeah  But why couldn't you  Fucking love him  You guys all love  The cowhead  He's a good guy  I'm not saying  He's one of the guys  We do like  But why did E-Rock  Just say  Cowhead's coming?  It's  It's the vagaries  I don't feel like  Having him yell at me  Today  She's pretty rich  Who?  Very  Oh yeah of course 
[01:33:00]  We love her  I think it's a wasted question  Would you say Sam?  What would it matter  How many people are here?  We'd find room for anybody  Of course  I mean  He wants to show you  His hairy abs  Why do you show us that?  She's just rich  She's just pretty  Get your fucking ass  In your pants  I mean  Cowhead could come in here  I mean  Everybody likes him  Yeah  And then this  This space  Where E-Rock is  Then it could be  Outside the glass  Oh my god  We've never ever  Worried about 
[01:33:30]  Even though we're  In a small spot  What is he plotting?  How many people  We need  I didn't have to worry  About it now  Because none of this  Was on the air  This was something  Back here  That had nothing  To do with  What you're doing  How much are these  People going to weigh  That are coming in  Hold on Rich  Sam  His excuse  Just now  Was  You guys don't understand  As the board operator  For the show  I was doing something  While you guys  Were on the air  That had nothing  To do with the show  Stop asking me  About it 
[01:34:00]  Your odd comment  Nothing to do  With what you were  Discussing currently  On the show  It's an inherent  Flawed logic  Let's say Mr. Abrams  JJ  JJ  Brings a huge entourage  Now what happens  Then what Iraq  Let's say it's 90 people  Yeah  What happens  Iraq  Then most of them  Gotta fit in here  Thus then  And it drives  Some of the listeners  Crazy  That's why 
[01:34:30]  I'll now use it more  Thus then  It didn't matter  How many people  Ever  Since Howard's gone  We use that  Big green room  Is JJ Abrams  A book writer  Didn't he write  A couple books  What do I know  That name from  Do you have a movie  Coming  For your documentary  Yeah  Moron  Ever hear of  JJ Abrams  Ever hear of  The show  Lost  Roland just called you  A moron  He did  I don't care  Let him feel good  For once in a while  Alright  I like  For once in a while  For once in a while

[01:38:30]  I said for what  He does  He's great  Now they didn't  Say Wayne Cotter  He thinks he's  Like a savvy  Like industry guy  Now  I was  Sometimes  You say things  And there you know  It's true  I mean I do think  For what he does  And she's just  Sitting there  Fucking suffering  Like dying inside  You know  For an unfunny  Piece of shit  He's pretty good  Colin  My point was  Because America's  Got Talent  He was the runner up  Right  And I'm saying  For your business  There are way 
[01:39:00]  Funnier guys  Even in that  The clean genre  Than Tom Cotter  I think he's a nice guy  I think he's a good comic  But he's not  He wasn't worth  All that attention  And exposure he got  That's all I was  Trying to say  I didn't say he sucked  Or any of that crap  But I'm like  It's not that  I could name off  A whole bunch of comics  That deserve that spot  Way before him  Because they're way more talented  Than that type of comic  That's all I'm saying  And I could list  A thousand people  That should be starring  In different movies  In movies  Or on television shows 
[01:39:30]  Alright  So don't  Listen  You're not  Colin your opinion  If you want to go there  Because I understand  You guys kind of like  You know  Protect your own  That's correct  I'm protecting my own  But I still  I'm more  I'm more interested  In what the hell  Difference  Of course  There's a million comics  Everybody can say  Every situation  Is like that  See what I mean  No one really understood  What he just babbled  That was kind of  What did the winner up get on  Fucking  What did the winner up get on  That show anyway  Like 20,000 bucks  Probably  Well you know 
[01:40:00]  Obviously he's got  He's got so much exposure  You know  His number's going to go up  When he starts  You know  Hits the road again  Yeah  Let me tell you something  I mean good for him  And he's doing a one man show  Long reality show short  Oh  Nothing on that one  Oh  Okay so one bad one  In an hour  Well all I know  Is I heard you were killing me  And since I've gone on the line  I haven't heard one goddamn amusing thing out of you  Oh what am I  You're a fucking tap dance boy  Here's  You're the one who called  So you're the one who  Be funny 
[01:40:30]  Be funny bitch  Go  Go  Rich  Rich came in here with an attitude today  No I did  I came in here very positive  He went down the list of our  Our pals  And trashed every single one of them  No I didn't  He started with you  He went with  He went after Jimmy  He went after Bob Kelly  He went after Patrice  And he went after Joe DeRose  No first of all  I didn't go after Patrice  One after another Colin  I didn't trash  He said what's wrong with all you guys  No  See this is what's wrong with you  You take 
[01:41:00]  I'm sure 90% of what he said was accurate  I'm sorry  Okay  You took every  You take it out of context  I said they're my type of comedy  But  What did you say about Colin again  I said he's  I said one  I said he's great  But the average public  From the Midwest  Or down south  Anyway  Average public  We let you get away with it once  Stupid  What  That's not an expression  It is an expression  The average public  Okay the public  The average public  The average person  Thank you Colin for breaking that down  The average person 
[01:41:30]  Okay  The average person  No you can't just  Change that part of it  It's the same stupid meaning  Whatever  I'm saying Colin's brilliant  Listen I stick up for Colin  Everywhere I go on the road  Except when you're on the Opie and Anthony show  First of all  Anyone care about that left handed compliment  That pants  I know  I stick up for you  Okay  Hi  Listen  Hey  Everywhere he goes  People are going  You know who's not funny  Colin's quitting  Now wait a minute  No wait  No no 
[01:42:00]  Here's the thing  Here's the thing  That means  That means everyone's coming to you  And saying how bad he is  Colin's right  I stick up for me  I don't need you to stick up for me  You fucking jackass  You couldn't  You're right though  What  You're fucking sounding like  Mr. you know  Hey I stick up for you  When I'm out there  At these great fucking places  You fucking idiots  Don't you see  I was setting him up  Don't you see 
[01:42:30]  I was trying to get his goat  I don't know Rich  We've been doing this a long time  I know  And everybody knows  And maybe it's time  To just take a rest  Well maybe we're just  The average public  Okay  I already  Go ahead  I already told you  I've said this story  A hundred times to us  When  One of those average idiots  When I came back to New York  From LA in 92  Was Rich Voss  He was a big shot at Caroline's  I went on  I did this kind of 
[01:43:00]  I did this kind of half ass  It was comedy  But it became  Comedy later  But I go  It's like a poem  I go off stage  I didn't do well  I was up there  I don't do poems folks  I do jokes  It was just the average public  That you're talking about  The average public  Okay  You're the fucking president  Of the average public  You goddamn idiot  Okay listen  Poem comic  Maybe you and Jeff Ross  Can get together  And write some poems together  Alright  No one wants to hear your poems 
[01:43:30]  Okay  Here's what I'm saying  You're up  No no no  I'm going to interrupt for a second  Okay go ahead  It's your show  Because E-Rock  Has found exactly  What he said  About Colin Quinn  Oh okay  So we don't misrepresent it  Okay  So we don't misrepresent it  Let's go  Let's go  Alright E-Rock  Let's hear it  I love E-Rock  If 80% of the Americans  Listened to Colin Quinn  And could figure out  What the fuck he was saying  They'd go  He's brilliant  But he's a mumbling douchebag  That won't slow the fuck down  And is a self-sabotaging asshole 
[01:44:00]  Oh  Oh that's exactly what you were trying to say  You said  Oh yeah  That sounded like a compliment  Did you hear the word  Here's the compliment  Did you hear the word brilliant in it  Okay  Because  That's the key word  Is brilliant  Okay  Self-sabotaging  The problem is you said  Brilliant up top  And then  Followed it with  The worst insults  That you can say  No it isn't  Most people don't understand  What he's talking about  Right  He is a douchebag  He knows it  He's self-sabotaging  That goes without saying  He can tell you a million stories 
[01:44:30]  Where he's fucking  Shot himself in the foot  Is that how you  Fucking defend him  To these hacks  At these little shit clubs  In the Midwest  No it's not the hacks  It's  You know  It's club owners  And radio people  They go  Yeah well  You know  You know  If we don't believe  Rich Moss  I think you're finished  You know  I try to get him  In Governors  But they're going  With his cousin  What I'm saying  Is Tim  Is Tim going to be  At Governors  He always opens for me  I request Tim  I always request Tim

Today the Opie and Anthony show presents a very special show  This is gonna change society  A show in memoriam  Traffic is really bad  People are walking across the Brooklyn Bridge right now just to get home to their computer 
[02:06:30]  Of a day that remains burned in our memories forever  I literally stopped breathing for two seconds  Today we remember it  I'm standing on 26th street in the West Side Highway and from my vantage point  This penis is jumping out of zippers  September 14th  2011  You know what this just replaced?  Where I was when my son was born  The day we saw Scarlett Johansson nude  Oh my god  Oh my god 
[02:07:00]  The titties right there on the screen  I have no words  I just want the pictures to speak for themselves  Moment of silence please  Join us as we reflect on not only the event  Innocence  We've lost a piece of our innocence  And some cum  But the people that were affected by 9-14  I'm one of the IT first responders here at ilikegirlsdaily.com  Sir I just watched server 7 go down  Yeah I want to know if I can donate lube and tissues  I almost just beer-ended somebody in the small mill 
[02:07:30]  Looking at the beautiful ass that is Scarlett Johansson  And as how we as a nation overcame  The city, the nation, I think is going to come together  There will be vigils  But instead of candles  We just will be grabbing these shafts of our dick  And standing there in silent prayer  Never forget  When we were erect  9-11 if you remember  We were all fucking driving around with those American flags  We need something that cleans us all together here  Yes  Remembering 9-14  On The Opie and Anthony Show 
[02:08:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  I've got big balls  I've got big balls  They're such big balls  And they're fancy big balls  And he's got big balls  And she's got big balls  But we've got the biggest  Balls are the balls  And my balls are always bouncing  And my balls are always full 
[02:08:30]  And everybody comes and comes again  If your name is on the guest list  No one can tell you  Why this?  I think it's Rich Voss  He likes big balls  Oh, nice  This is your song, Rich  Turn it up  Sure did it up  And they're such big balls  Fancy big balls  And he's got big balls  And she's got big balls  But he's got the biggest 
[02:09:00]  Balls are the balls  I don't remember this song  It's like, oh, right  So he's saying, oh, it's dirty  Tee-hee  We don't have much time left with Rich Voss  So we want to take advantage of that  Oh, jeez  Why, you guys got to leave?  No, I heard you have to  You have other things to do or something?  I'm supposed to do G100 today  And Goomba, Goomba  Johnny  I don't even know if he's on here  Yeah, what happened to Goomba?  I see him walking around  I think he's on in the afternoon  I see him walking around 
[02:09:30]  The Upper West Side once in a while  He's a nice guy  He's a good guy  He's a very nice guy  He's a good fella  He is a good fella  Yeah  Yes, I'm a fan  You're a fan?  You should be  There's certain people I'm a fan of  What are we going to talk about here?  What about all the radio?  Can we teach something?  Radio flea  Oh, yeah  But I gave away the fucking punch  Sorry, Rich  That's pretty much what this place is  I was just walking back from the old shit arena  And I'm looking at all these windows  And realizing  While we're doing this show 
[02:10:00]  And this show is like  It's our little fucking world  Between 6 and 10  This is what we do  And stuff  There's a thousand other fucking shows  Going on through these windows  Everywhere  You just walk down the hallway  Because it's all glass  And you look and go  There's a show  There's a show  And they're in their little world  And it's their important little show  And I'm just going  This just means nothing  You know what's funny?  I like pointing out our differences  Finally  Because many years  We went as one  With this radio show 
[02:10:30]  You know what I think  When I walk down the halls?  That's a waste  That's a waste  That's a waste of money  Not a waste of money  I swear to God  I swear to God  I'm just thinking  I'm just thinking to them  It's very important  They're doing the show  They're going to break  They're thinking  Okay what are we doing  After that  We got a guest coming in  And I'm just passing them by  In the hallway  Looking through the glass  For a split second  Going back to my little  Fucking microcosm  Yeah it's weird  And the thing is 
[02:11:00]  They all think  They're the biggest  In the building  Right  Like they don't even know  And it's nothing against you  They don't know you exist  They don't care  They don't care  Because it's all about  It's all about  You know  Sanchez  Alvarez  And the morning  Puerto Rican  Whatever it's called  You know what I mean  I don't think I passed them by  Okay  Where do they hide that show  No it's obvious  This place doesn't like Puerto Ricans  We don't have one Puerto Rican show  Yeah that girl  Isn't that girl Puerto Rican  The hot one always walks by  With the two black people 
[02:11:30]  Nicole?  I don't know  But she's not doing  Puerto Rican radio  But she's Puerto Rican  That's one genre  That Sirius XM  Has decided they don't need  She's not Puerto Rican  We got the black radio  We got the sports radio  We got the white guy radio  We got the chick radio  We don't have the Puerto Rican radio  They don't like Hispanics  No  They don't believe  In Hispanic programming  Really?  Sam can pass this Puerto Rican  Give me a channel  Caliente  Oh  Besides that  Caliente  They're number one on XM  They're probably huge  When do they broadcast  I really have never seen 
[02:12:00]  The Caliente type people  Well they don't do  I mean they're in those  Little boots  Oh okay  You know what I mean  Everything's pre-recorded  They don't do any real shows  See what I mean  They throw them in a little closet  So I guess my point  Has been made sort of  I had a rental car  And I was trying to find  You guys the other day  But I didn't know  What their number was  I don't even know  Wait  I'm going to try this again  I think I finally know  Okay  And I'm doing a bit  XM 105  Correct  206  Yeah  I swear to you  For a long time 
[02:12:30]  I didn't know  What challenge we want  206  Kind of bad  You know how many  Black people are going  Let's play those numbers  Really  That's what you got to do  That's what they do  Oh so you said  There's like a flea market  It is  It's like a flea market  Of fucking radio  You walk through here  It's like one of those  Conventions  Come to our booth  You know  There's probably posters  Out front  And bumper stickers  Like you guys used to do  Come to our booth  What's wrong with bumper stickers  I heard the slam  I heard it  I just said like  That was a weird little  Fucking slap in the face  It wasn't  You grew  What's wrong with  I said bumper stickers  You guys grew  I still like the bumper sticker 
[02:13:00]  You do  Yeah  Oh okay  People send me like  Instagram pictures  Of wow stickers  It kind of warms my heart  It does  Yeah it does  I still like the bit  I'm dodging her  But I don't do it anymore  I like that bit  Always did  Yep  We'll be fans of the dodging  And the dryer door  Yes  I still do that one  Hey uh  The door  There he is  You took a rare bathroom break  Yes yes yes  That stupid Elvis radio  Does it drive you nuts  I heard it in there  How many stories  Can you tell about the guy  We went to Graceland 
[02:13:30]  I heard  They have a guy I guess  That knows stories about Elvis  And that's all he does  On that channel  But they were playing Elvis music  When I went in there  Yeah but in between  I remember the time  Elvis played Chattanooga  As opposed to  Fucking that jazz shit  I'd take Elvis radio any day  You know  Shut up  That one note  That you're doing in there  Yeah  That goes right through you  Right  I can only imagine 
[02:14:00]  You're in a jazz club  Back in the day  With a lady  With nice stems  And you're trying  To have a conversation  And that note  Will go through you  In the middle  Of your conversation  It drives me fucking nuts  I can't get out of the bathroom  Uh oh  Rich  Oh what's this  Rich is showing Anthony  A video on his smart phone  Take rattle and roll  Who's that 
[02:14:30]  I was at  Who's that  Last week  I was in  Working in Rhode Island  And New Hampshire  No I mean Maine  And New Hampshire  Stop bragging  And they had an Elvis convention  In the hotel  Oh man  First of all  Elvis wasn't black  Okay  Black Elvis  But this one guy  Came out and sang  He's from Vegas  He's an Elvis guy  But that's the whole Elvis thing  It's not good enough  To be an Elvis person  And now it's like  There's offshoots  There is the black Elvis  There's the Asian  Right  But this guy 
[02:15:00]  Was really good  Yeah  He was really good  He did his show  And he progressed  He progressed  And then at the end  He fell off a toilet  And died  No but he was good  Okay  Was that a bit  Was that a bit  I need to know  I just made it a bit  But it's not a funny one  It's not a bit I do on stage  But it was a bit  You just came up with  No it was a joke  I just tried to throw out  It didn't work  It didn't work  They're not all  It happens  My  I'm thinking  What do you think  That would be a great concept  For an Elvis impersonator 
[02:15:30]  No  It starts out as young Elvis  And then it gets fatter  And drugged out  And then falls  His closer  Is him falling dead  From a toilet  Good night  Thank you  I would actually go see that  Black Elvis  Because you know  He stole it from the black man  Yeah  So it kind of works  But this place  This hotel was mobbed  With Elvis fans  And they  You know  Half of them look like Elvis  And  How can these conventions  There's never hot girl  The only hot convention  I went to  I went to a swinger  I was performing  At a hotel  Oh boy 
[02:16:00]  I was performing  At a hotel  Before I was married  At the improv  In Reno  And they had a swinger convention  In the hotel  That week  And  The guys were just  Fat messes  But there were some  Really hot girls  Were you bummed  Oh yeah  I heard you again there  I think Rich says things  That we're supposed to  Pick up on  What did I say  You're bummed  That the guys  Were hot messes  No I'm saying  The girls were hot though  I wasn't bummed  Well why would you say  That the guys  Were hot messes  I had  Like 
[02:16:30]  If you were at a hotel  And there was a  Swingers convention  Right  One of the things  You'd mention  Is the guys were hot  Yes  Not if I was  Not if I wasn't  Involved  If you're involved  In the swinger thing  And you're a couple  Alright  You don't want some  Some nasty guy  Fucking your chick  Yeah yeah  You don't want to see  Fucking sweaty  E-Rock  Laying on your girl  But you weren't there  To fuck anyone  So why would you say  Come to think of it  You don't want any guy  Fucking your girl  But that's not true  I'm weird I guess  Jesus  You wouldn't mind that 
[02:17:00]  No I wouldn't want that  Wait but  My point is this Rich  Once again  If you weren't there  To fuck anything  Why would you mention  That the guys were messes  Because I'm saying  These swingers  The girls  Because  The girls are losing out  The girls  A lot of them are hot  You know  And  I feel bad  That they got to trade off  Their  Hotness  For some fucking  You know  Guy  That's  Discussing  You know  Listen  I was in the dressing room  I didn't do anything

[02:31:00]  Because these smarmy  Fucking Europeans  End up fucking  Our American girls  Yeah  I don't like that at all  And what if she wants  To go to some  Fucking Arab  Animal country  Oh that could never happen  Never  Never  Right  Oh no but I hear  Dubai's nice  And stuff  Fuck that  You know what  You say  You go to  To Amsterdam  Holland  Yeah  It's full of fucking  Moroccans and Arabs  Yes  You go to fucking  You end up in the  Sex slave trade  You know  Oh boy  And if I don't get  Percentage out of that  Right  I was in Egypt

[02:41:30]  There's no doubt in my mind  Crazy  J.J. Abrams  Oh yeah  J.J. Abrams is here  Welcome back to the show sir  Take a seat sir  There's uh  Yeah  You can't  You can't win with a kid  We were just talking to  Rich Vos over here  We were just talking to  His daughter  She's like 22  22  On the phone  And she is just an entitled  I gotta say it bitch  She was very bitchy  She really was bitchy  She was asking for the iPhone 5  And a car  And new tires  And just really annoying  But one thing  She didn't complain  That we didn't put her  In our movie  Our documentary  Our big documentary 
[02:42:00]  The movie we made  Uh  Look who you're sitting next to  I'm just saying  I'm just showing up  I know what he's doing here  Hold on  What I'm saying is  She just embarrassed all of us  Why  Yeah  Exactly  Oh god  You know  And we've already had offers  And it's not even finished  But what I'm saying  I want to talk to Rich  About his movie  I want to talk to JJ  About his TV show  JJ  I'm embarrassed  Holy Jesus  He's a local guy  That we had in today  I'm not a fucking local  I'm a national fucking comic 
[02:42:30]  I don't know much about him  Go fuck yourself  I'm a local guy  He's playing a local comedy club  And you know how that goes  With radio  Now first of all  I'm carrying this show  I'm at Mohegan Sun  Big Casino  I'm down with you  This Saturday  Like a Titanic  Carry bodies  Let me tell you something  About these fucking radio hacks  JJ's been on our show  And he had a good time  That's why he's back  Why'd you hide the bullhorn  I don't have the bullhorn  Oh it's broken  What are you going to do  Look JJ Abrams is here  Sorry JJ  We only have a few minutes with the guy 
[02:43:00]  Yeah we don't have a lot of time  With him  And I want to  I saw the first episode  Oh yeah  Very cool  And I love this  Even when I saw the teasers  When it first came out  Very cool concept  Earth  There we are  Going about our business  And every bit of power  Gone  Just goes out  And a lot of people have wondered  What would happen  If that actually did happen  How long it would take  For things to kind of  Get a little  A little dodgy  Yeah I'd last about an hour  About an hour  Yeah yeah  Maybe an hour  Especially if it was worldwide  Because that would freak people out  No it's nuts  It's a great what if 
[02:43:30]  Yeah  This guy Eric Kripke  Came and pitched the show  And it was just this  It's funny  Because the show he pitched  Was almost more like  A Lord of the Rings  Quest adventure  And I was like  The hell  And then he said  And it takes place here  In the not too distant future  And I was like  What?  And the pitch  Of everything going out  You kind of think  Well let's get past  The science of that  For a second  What would we do?  And the truth is  It's kind of unbelievable  When you actually think  About transportation  Communication  Just  Everything  Yeah  Eating food 
[02:44:00]  Anything  Survival  It's insane  How much we rely on  Yeah  What I also like  Is how  When time goes by  You realize also  The little subtleties  That you wouldn't notice  Like  You wouldn't be able  To cut down bushes  And trees  Very economically  So  Like the buildings  Are all just  Encased in  Ivory and all  Vines  And vegetation  Rich what are you doing?  I'm looking at Anthony  No  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  J.J. Abrams is distracted  He keeps looking at you  As Anthony's making 
[02:44:30]  Some good points  About his new show  Revolution  Oh my god  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I'm looking at you  He's looking at the camera  No I'm not  I'm trying to talk  He's J.J.  He looked at me like  Is my posture okay?  Are you alright?  I'm just sitting right  Okay  I love it  And you're making  A really good point  About this show  Relax  He was talking about bushes  Yeah  What are you doing?  I didn't do anything  My star and David  Oh you're freaking  Star and David  Jesus  Oh that's what  Well not Jesus 
[02:45:00]  Oh man  I saw that he was  Adjusting something  And I thought  He was adjusting  As a pro Jew  You just want to  Make sure  I connect to what he does  And what about  Your tattoos  Mr. Not paying attention  To the rules  Never again  Wait a minute  That's against the rules  Right  That is against the rules  Huh?  It is  It's controversial  No that's bullshit  It's not against the rules  That's what he hears  The club owners say  After they hire him  No because  Hold on  The Jews are talking now  He wanted J.J.  No he's a Jew  I know  Now I get it  You didn't have that out 
[02:45:30]  Earlier  You fucking  You just caught on  Yes  Listen  You're the kind of guy  Magic acts love  Here's the thing  Tattoos is bullshit  Because if Jews  Couldn't be buried  Because of that  They couldn't be buried  Because of facelifts  And nose jobs  Because that's the face  In your body too  So there wouldn't be  One fucking Jew  In a cemetery  If that was the case  You've used that joke  A hundred times  It's not a joke  It's a truth  But it's a hundred times  It's the truth  We've cleared that up  I'm glad that's past that  I don't want J.J. glancing over to you 
[02:46:00]  Because he feels uncomfortable  When we're talking about  His new show Revolution  I'm entertained  This is good  I have a question  Time period wise  Is it  You go away in the future  Eventually  Or  It's 15 years in the future  Right now  Yes  You know the power goes out  Right  And then  They gotta go into the future  Because you know  At first it would just be  A lot of  Ah  Well we do flashbacks  And you can kind of see  What happened over time  But the cool idea  I think that Eric pitched  Was  This massive thing happens  And we jump ahead 
[02:46:30]  And the idea is  That now we're  You know  You get to kind of see  Not just what's happening  15 years ahead  But you get to see  In flashbacks  Kind of  The highlights of  Of what happened  During the interim  Yeah  I ask because  We've all seen the show  What happens to the earth  If the power goes out  And it gets cooler and cooler  Where all of a sudden  Animals are roaming  Manhattan  And all that  Yeah  Well there is  Literally  There are storylines  That we are doing  And one that we've done  That where there is  This kind of like  You know  The idea of  Walking down the street  In the middle of the city  And there are these 
[02:47:00]  Feral you know  Wolves and dogs  It's insane  So there is a lot  Of that stuff too  But you know  The thing that  When he pitched the show  There was this kind of  Crazy big romantic  Sort of family adventure  That he pitched  And I was like  You know  That was what got me  The power going out  Kind of was the thing  That was the catalyst for it  And that was pretty cool  Yeah  And then also  There's of course  Because you're involved  There has to be some  Strange little twist to it  I gather  There's some type of way  Maybe to get the power  Back on 
[02:47:30]  Or  Well there is  And this is this  Kind of the questing part  It is one of the  You know  If in Lord of the Rings  The ring is the thing  It's like the idea  Of the power  That you know  Getting the power back on  Can it happen  Why did it go off  These are things that  You know  Eric's going to  Actually get to  Fairly quickly  Like instead of  Oh okay  You know  A lot of stuff  That I've been involved in  Which answers come way late  If at all  These are things  Eric wants to get  I don't know what show  You're talking about  I don't even know  Who you are  But the idea of  You know  For Eric  Frankly he's someone  Who doesn't subscribe 
[02:48:00]  To that kind of  Storytelling  Where he wants to get things  We argue about this  A little bit sometimes  He wants to answer things  Much quicker than I would  Okay  And yet  You know  We'll get answers  Much sooner than  You would otherwise  Yeah  I like that  Because I saw a couple  Of little teasers in there  About you know  On a very small scale  A little bit of power  Coming on  And things happening  That is part of  The quest of the show  Yeah  Sounds like a great concept  Yeah  It's fun  I like this  Absolutely  If you take a show  Like let me just choose  One at random 
[02:48:30]  Like Lost  What?  Lost?  A little show called Lost  The whole thing  Like initially  You think  Okay here's the thing  They crash on an island  And now they've got  To deal with it  That would get old  Kind of quickly  Unless there was that  Weird kind of  Other story going on  That was the big mystery  Of the whole thing  And that's what I see  In Revolution also  Well I think that  Obviously it's a very  Different kind of show  On every level  But I will say that  You know  On Lost  What Damon Lindelof  Did running that show  For six years  He had 
[02:49:00]  He did the thing  That I actually  Wouldn't have known  How to do  Which is  He did  Not just protract  That idea  But he  You know  He dove into  These sort of  Character  You know  Dynamics  That to me  Was really what  The show was about  People were at the end  Of the series  Watching  All they wanted to know  Was what the island was  But Damon was telling  A story that was really  About who these people were  You know  Where they were  What they meant to each other  And that was  I thought  You know  A more profound thing 
[02:49:30]  Than any kind of  Scientific answer  I mean  It's almost like that thing  If you remember  In Pulp Fiction  Where they had that case  Yeah  With the old  Light  And it's like  You never wanted to know  What was in that case  You want to know  But you don't want to know  It didn't matter really  But in the end you don't  Yeah but if you know  What's in the case  There's no answer  That would satisfy you  The beauty of that was  You didn't know  And that was the genius of that  So for me I feel like  You know  There are certain questions  That if you're too coy  If you're playing  With the audience  They'll resent you  If you don't tell them  Soon enough  Because you cannot  Give an answer  After a while  That is a satisfying answer 
[02:50:00]  And I feel like  On a show like  You know  Like Revolution  You know  Eric Kripke wants to  Get to the answers sooner  So we can  Of course  Ask more questions  Right  Yeah  Cool  I have a question about  Lost  It could be the dumbest one  I'm sure  I'm sure it will be  Rich  I would bet money it is  Okay when that show  Was created in the first season  Did they have a vision  Where it was going  The sixth season  Or was it  As they were going along  Building the story arcs  Well when we created that show  Good question by the way  And we were doing the pilot  And I remember filming the pilot 
[02:50:30]  Damon and I were having conversations  About how the series would go  And what would happen  But the truth is  Anyone who tells you  At the beginning of a series  That they know exactly  How the show is going to end  Is full of shit  And the reason why is  As you're working on the show  You think  Oh this relationship  We're going to do  Is going to kill  And literally you cast an actor  That just destroys it  And it's no good  And you're like  Oh shit  And you're just going to  Stick with it  Because you determined  You weren't going to do that  And you'll hire an actor  To play a one day part  Or a one episode part  And they're so brilliant  Yeah  You go 
[02:51:00]  Oh my god  This character  And all of a sudden  So for example  Michael Emerson  You know  Who was on Lost  He was going to be  On that show  For you know  One episode  And he came in  And you know  Those guys decided  There's no way  This is going to be  Part of our main storyline  And so  The reality  Which one was he  You have to bend  Which one was he  You literally have to  Listen to this evolving  Sort of organic  Like a live thing  And if you don't 
[02:51:30]  You're actually doing  A disservice  Because you might have  A great actor  Who's on an episode  And you're not going  To take advantage of it  Because you're like  No it has to be  You missed the opportunity  That's right there  In front of you  In Revolution  You've got a  It's a pretty big  It's a pretty big cast  Yeah  Is that harder  To work with  A larger cast  As far as writing  And even producing  The show  Than it is  Kind of a smaller  It is a little bit  You know  More difficult  When you've got  A lot of people to serve  And the truth is  As in Lost  There are some characters  Who have one line  You know  Three episodes in a row 
[02:52:00]  They'll have a little  Thing here or there  I always love  The background people  It's like  They have a life  And a story  They're stuck here too  Yeah  But even some of the main cast  You know  When you get a large cast  When you have a dozen people  Or so  You know  In your main  You can't  Have everyone  Get the spotlight  In every episode  Every episode  Yeah  But it also gives you options  It was fun  When you saw some of the main characters  In the background  You're like  What's he doing  Just sitting there  Well you had  Talk to somebody  The first season  You had the  The cute girl  And the boyfriend 
[02:52:30]  That didn't last  Yeah  They lasted like  Four episodes  Yeah  They were like  Brother and sister  Or something  Then she ended up on Taken  Then she ended up on Taken  But then  But then  The guy who played  The heroin addict  That in real life  Went out with  The lead girl  Who  I loved his  Fucking character  I just loved it  Charlie  He's the greatest  Charlie  Just a great character  I mean  A fucking  Heroin addict  Stuck there  He finds all that heroin  Enough about Lost  We're here about Revolution  Although I do have to ask 
[02:53:00]  A little bit about Star Trek  Yes sir  What's going on  What are we  What are we looking at  As far as  Give me kind of a timeline  When we're going to be seeing this  Give us something  You're seeing it next May  Next May  Yeah  Okay  And  Can you confirm or deny  Because I heard rumors  But then I heard them  Kind of dispelled  Give us a script  Will there be any  Involvement of Khan  Nice  While it is slightly early  To be discussing the movie  I will tell you that  You know  We're editing the movie right now  And I 
[02:53:30]  You know  I could not be more excited  About this movie  It is  Oh  We almost said it  We almost said it  We would be stars today  We'd be on every blog  I love  I  Just say yes  The first one  Ask him another question  That's a yes  And we'll splice it  I know  Do you like ice cream  I know  Do you like ice cream  He was a yes  Yeah  I love the first one  The action  And the personality  Nice 
[02:54:00]  He winked  I saw it  I saw it winked  The ability  To be able to  Take characters  That were just  Beloved  Yeah  And you would think  There's no way  You could actually  Put new people  Playing these characters  Change storylines around  It's Star Trek  A heresy  And you pulled it off  It's amazing  Thank you  It was a big group  Of people  And I gotta say  Cause I wasn't a Trekkie  Growing up whatsoever  I saw the movies  You know  But I'm all in  With the reboot  Oh right on 
[02:54:30]  Will we be seeing  Lens flare  I apologize in advance  Wait is that a camera  You have a flashlight  I can  Yeah  No but the fact is  That it is this  Ridiculous thing  That I like to do  And I tried to  You know  Dial it back a little bit  Cause it was getting  A little  Really  Well my wife  She'd look at daily  She'd be like  JJ come on  Really  I heard they weren't  You didn't digitally  Add the lens flare  You guys took flashlights  Here's the thing  Unless it's the digital scenes 
[02:55:00]  No no  We shot on film  For both movies  And we literally  Had dudes with  These halogen flashlights  Off camera  A lot of time  It was the DP  And doing the thing  That you know  You learn as a director  Of photography  To avoid  You're always flagging  And he you know  Was kind enough  To break all the rules  And we actually  Started to figure out  Which lenses flare well  Which lenses don't flare at all  Like you know  Once you have like  A zoom lens on  You're screwed  There's no flare  So it's just  I liked it  I liked the technique  There are going to be moments  I'm so self conscious  About it now  There are moments 
[02:55:30]  Where I'm watching  I'm like  But you know  I don't really care  Cause I  I actually like it  And in Star Trek  It looks amazing  I know  I shouldn't have done it  So much in Super 8  But I didn't  That first  That opening scene  Of Star Trek  On the initial  Yes  With Kirk's father  No I'm saying  Oh God  That was a lot of action  Quick moves  And the lens flare  Just added to it  Cause in some  In some cases  You're kind of  Trying to look around it  What's happening back there  You see something  Yeah there were  A few moments  Where I feel like  I should have 
[02:56:00]  Definitely pulled it back  I did  I feel guilty  Well JJ's gotta go  Can I ask JJ  Did you have a good time today  I love it  I don't wanna go  Oh good  Yes or no  Yes or no  Did you have a good time  Oh no  You asshole  He's gonna splice  Into yes  Damn it  I thought you were  Gonna invite me  To be the Jew  How about  The next day  How about this  Because they ask me  About other comics  And Trish  And other comics  And I'm a comic  Why don't you ask  What director's a hack  Why don't you go  After that  It's too involved 
[02:56:30]  For now  It's too involved  They wanted to  Throw me under  He took two characters  From Oz  And put them on Lost  Okay  Right there  Fucking clever  That was good  Okay do you know  Who the two characters were  No  Yeah  Out of BC  Oh god  Wow  And Michael  And Michael  Yeah  Wow very good  JJ we're all gonna watch  Revolution  Monday nights at 10pm  On NBC  This is  Yes very cool  Thanks you guys  Absolutely  JJ Abrams back to a television  Thanks very much  We'll take a quick break  And we'll finish up next  You know what  I think I'm gonna run too

[03:00:00]  It's gonna drop  It's gonna plummet  Because you're talking about  Don't talk  Don't talk about it  Jesus Christ  You know the rules  When you talk about a stock  It goes down  17,951  I just lost a couple thousand dollars  Don't talk about it  When you talk about the stock  It always fucked up  Get rid of it  And get rid of this creepy guy  Standing next to me  It's a mush  What is this  Sal fucked up  Let me see your tattoo  On his tiny little arms  What is that  Mandala  He likes his grandma  No  That's what  No no no  Hold on I got it  He likes his grandma so much  He decided to get her doily 
[03:00:30]  Fucking tattooed on his arm  Doily  That's a doily right  Can I handle this  That wasn't funny  I thought it was funny  That was alright  It was kind of funny  I wanted to put my drink on it  Was it the delivery  No I wanted to put my drink on it  What did I go wrong there  As a stand up comic rich  The timing was bad  What did I do wrong  Oh you talked  This tattoo looks like  It looks like a doily  No  It does  But how do I make it funny  How do you make it funny  Don't answer please  What is that  It's a Mandala  What do you mean  A Mandala 
[03:01:00]  It was in prison for 25 years  Kenny actually made that joke once  Okay good  So I didn't hear  When he said it  First of all  You fucking fake hipster  I didn't hear the fucking jokes  Now tell me what it stands for  Do you realize what you just said to yourself  You're done  I really like Voss  I don't give a fuck if you like me  You're not my target audience  Go down to the Lower East Side  And sit there and go  Oh that's fucking brilliant  Now what does it stand for  Maybe someone should cut your mic off  In the middle of talking  How about that  I really apologize about that  Why don't you pay attention  I'm a fan of Voss 
[03:01:30]  Who gave you  Pandering cocksucker  What does that stand for  Hold on  I'm getting a call  What  Bonnie's calling  And why don't you pay attention  No I thought  Ant was hitting his cut mic button  And I thought  Meaning you weren't paying attention  That's my question  Right  No  Right well no  I was  I was yeah  Why not listen to the live read  Sam can you explain to me  Why the guys that sit in that room  Don't feel like paying attention  I don't know  It's not  It's not good for our egos  Knowing the guy at the fucking nerve center  Doesn't want to listen to the show  Can I tell you something  We now have two guys that feel that way  You guys are sitting here doing a show 
[03:02:00]  Are we not bad now  Don't ask that question  There's a room next door  That is literally  The direct feed of your show  As you speak  Is going into that room  And those guys couldn't be less interested  In what you're talking about  I know  It's got to be terrible for you guys  To do a show under those conditions  Are you an intern or are you paid  Well  That's up for debate still  Especially after that one  Yeah  I think that E-Rock  Since that's his room  Has got to whip that room into shape  Because Sal obviously learned somewhere  That you don't need to pay attention  To the show  When you're behind the board  No I always pay attention 
[03:02:30]  Except for that one time  Are you straight or gay  I'm straight  No you're not  No I'm not  Come out of the closet  And make everybody get more comfortable  Put it  Are you ready  Yeah just be for real  Be for real  I'm not coming out of the closet  Because I'm not gay  Be who you are  I am who I am  Were you at Occupy Wall Street  No  Oh you weren't  No why would I be there  His parents have a lot of money  They have a lot of money  Are they loaded  His parents are part of the 1%  Oh they are  He wouldn't want to go down  Oh so this is like a thesis project  For him  And let's study 
[03:03:00]  The lower form of radio  Were you raised in an environment  Without consequences  And so you feel like  Well I don't really need to pay attention  I can kind of go in half ass  There's not really anything  To stop me  Don't you think you should wait  About 20 minutes  Before you start asking questions  When it's your fucking show  It's their show  Bravo  Who the fuck do you think you are  Thank you Rich  I knew we were on the same page  Me and Voss  You're fucking jumping in  Like it's the Opie Anthony  And fucking  Bird nest hair show  Go fuck yourself 
[03:03:30]  These are the fucking main players  These guys  These guys  Them, me  And then  J.J. Abrams  J.J. was fun  Wasn't he  I like that guy  That guy is  A fucking  Power broker  Oh man  And he was just  Hanging us like  With  Hanging  If he would have  Saw my movie  I'm telling you  He fucking  Enough about the movie  He's going to google me  Did my strategy work  You not talking about the stock  Hold on  Because I know  Every time you talk about the stock  Bad things happen to it  No it's good 
[03:04:00]  Because you didn't talk about it again  See  Well good  If bad things happen  You start talking about  Babiglia  He's got that sleep movie  You know he blew us off  Do you want me to tell you  No way  He kind of blew us off  Why  I'll tell you  He kind of blew us off  If you want to do  Howard before us  Or something like that  I'll tell you what  He's rolling  Rolling  He ain't lying  I punched out  At what  You panicked  I panicked  At how much  You didn't make 20 though  I made 18,500 
[03:04:30]  Not bad  Not bad for a guy  That doesn't need it  In one day  Why don't you donate  Half of it  Why don't you donate  But I was in the shitter  Fucking five grand yesterday  And I was in the shitter  15,000 two days ago  Let me ask you this  So fuck that  Let me ask you this  Now that you tapped out  Where would you be  If you didn't tap out  Let's take a look  At Apple  And see what it does  See if it goes up  C or down Z  Let me ask you this  I'll get back in  Don't fucking tempt me 
[03:05:00]  I should buy put options  Right the fuck now  And bank that  That shit's gonna tank  Let me ask you this  All the money  You've gambled in life  Where would you be  If you didn't  I'll tell you  You'd be in a better place  Alright  Tell yourself that  However you gotta sleep  At night my friend  Well have you made more  Or lost more than  I have no idea  I think you've made more  Over the years  I think you've made more  But doesn't that mean  You lost probably  I lost a lot  I lost big  You've had some big hits  You know about  You know where you're  You know where you're at about 
[03:05:30]  Yeah I know  Up or down  I probably did pretty good  Yeah  I think I did pretty good  That's pretty fucking good  Because there's not too many people  That can say that  There's not many guys  That can say that  You're right  Gambling  So what does this have to do  About Sal  Fucking up with you  Oh Sal  Sal fucked my read up  I just don't know  What kind of discipline  We need to enact  To make sure that people  Pay attention in the other room  Whether it's pop quizzes  Throughout the show  To find out if they've been  Listening the whole time  I don't know  I misinterpreted something  Sal what did we talk about  While watching the show today  What did you talk about  On the show today  I repeated 
[03:06:00]  You know what that is  Give a brief overview  Of what we did on  The Opie and Anthony show today  Well you had Rich Voss in  And you were talking about  How he preferred  He preferred  Oh my god  Surveying the room  And he's repeating questions  So he has more time to think  Oh man  Oh boy  Go ahead  Voss by the way  If you want to know Sal  Here's what I was doing  I said  You could record shows  At the same time  Right  Should I do the whole read  Yes  Okay  Do you subscribe to Dish  Well you should

Oh, oh  I need to know  Let's see  I need to know  Well, if it goes past  695 dollars a share  Yeah  Then I'm going to go  Shit, I should have stayed in  If it goes under 695 dollars a share  That's 693 right now  Oh, we're doing good

[03:08:30]  Good one  I asked for fucking blueberries  And bananas  You got strawberries  And  And fucking  Buttery oatmeal  693  693  692  692  I'm going to sit  I'm going to sit on it  692  692  692  692  692  692  Look at this  Who puts a fucking slab of butter  I hope it  Oh, is that a banana?  It's not butter  It's bananas  Oh my God  Rich thinks there's big chunks of butter  In his oatmeal  They're banana slices 
[03:09:00]  Look at that yellow thing  You don't think that's butter right there?  I don't know  Because we can still see  We're not as old as you  Oh wow  Is that butter?  Yeah  That's crazy  Wait, is it really butter?  God damn  That's a fucking  God  Why would you put  The bypass  You're making a mess  Is that really butter?  Yes  It's probably banana juice  Yeah, it's fucking  Banana juice  Banana juice  Hey, throw it on your back  Alright, Sal  Yes  Incompetent  Sal, can I see your cock?  Oh, wow  Sal  No 
[03:09:30]  What did we do on the show today?  Run down the list  Quick  You were talking about your allergies earlier on?  Not really  Not really?  Okay  In passing, yes  In passing, yes  Maybe 30 seconds  What do we start the show with?  The main topic is  Yeah, I always struggle trying to remember the first segment  I really do  I can't remember it  What the fuck?  How do you struggle?  Why?  I'm just a zombie in the morning  That early  But I remember  You can't handle getting up early  Your parents didn't start writing you checks till 11am  You got a guy 
[03:10:00]  Are you a fan of the show?  You got a guy  By the way, you got a guy working for your show  Who's brand new  Who for the first hour you're on the air  Your staff member is a zombie  Is struggling to  You guys are putting a show on  Is struggling to remember what we do  When the other guys are listening  And they're like  Oh, wait, okay  Let me get this for them  Because they said this  Yeah  That's exactly right  I'm going to start making a list  Just like you  What else happened?  My own log  You shouldn't even make a list  Check it twice  Voss what?  Voss was talking about  How he preferred the side of a male penis 
[03:10:30]  He said  To a vagina  Not just side of it  The whole thing  The side of it  What's the difference between a penis and a male penis?  Especially the side of a male penis  Right  Alright, what else?  You guys had J.J. Abrams in the studio?  Oh  Oh my god  He hates our show  Why?  This is like when people  How do we do this to ourselves time and time again?  What did you learn?  And they call up with what happened in the last 20 minutes of the show?  Right, right  Alright, we had J.J. Abrams  Good  What else?  What were the highlights of the show? 
[03:11:00]  What were the bullet points?  My favorite thing today was definitely when Colin Quinn called in  Oh  By the way, this is coming from the phone screener  Right  What part of the Colin Quinn interview was your favorite part?  Well, when he was  When you guys were addressing the fact that Voss was calling out each individual comic  Like he was calling out to Rosa  And he saw E-Rock pulling the clips because he's in the room with him  Sam, I was marking it in Pro Tools before Eric  It's all stuff he could have known about because he was in that room  Well, yeah, because I'm listening to the show and I'm in that room  Oh, but you're not listening because you hit the break while I was talking 
[03:11:30]  Who's your favorite radio show?  This one  Come on  Scott and Todd  No, I don't even listen to that  Are you a Scott and Todd guy?  Scott and Todd  E-Rock's like, ooh  You and Todd  Oh, I'm going to have to start hanging out with Sal more  Oh, wow  A man after my own heart  Yeah  Be honest, do you and Eric listen to Elvis Duran in that room in the morning?  No, we don't  How sad is it that that guy syndicated everywhere for that nonsense?  Did you miss Mark Torano?  Whatever, we're over the Mark Toranos  No, not him  Him  Who? 
[03:12:00]  Him  I don't think Sam ever worked with Mark  Can we go home?  Rich, thank you, man  You were great today  Thank you  Oh, man  Now I got to hear later  Why just today?  I mean, I'm cold all the time  Oh, man  But when you entered the show  You said you were great today  And I just wonder what that actually means  Okay  I fucking hate your shirt  We went over it  You'll never see it again, I promise  Can I have it?  Can I say something real quick before you do the plugs? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah  E-Rock has a really good observation about the Sal thing  Oh  He said it in my ear  Good  E-Rock, come on  Let's all be on the same page with you for once  Okay  Sal doesn't remember that we started the show with his own bit  Ugh  Like the one good idea he's had since he's been here  Is that it was his idea to do the 9-14 stuff  His idea, but he did not  He didn't remember  Remember it  He did not record it  He wasn't involved in the production in any way, right?  No  The creative was not his  No  He just said we should do September 14th  And he didn't remember that we played it three times 
[03:13:00]  Oh, my God  No, we're going to play it four  Oh, my God  Because after today, we can't really play it  And people haven't heard it  But  Might as well burn it out today  We played on the after show a bunch of times  Rich, what's the big plug?  Because we do have to go  All right  Saturday, Mohegan Sun  Friday, go to treehousecomedy.com  Next weekend, Governors  Wait, do you want them to go to the website or the club?  Go to either website  No, I mean Saturday, I know it's Mohegan Sun  I'm not sure where tonight in Connecticut  So go to treehousecomedy.com 
[03:13:30]  Why?  They own all these different places?  Yeah, I'm doing two places  Treehousecomedy.com  Books like seven or eight rooms  So I'm doing Mohegan Sun tomorrow  And I'm doing a place tonight  Next week, I'll be at Governors  But you don't know what the place is tonight?  I just thought it was the Treehouse  That's the name of the company  Oh, my God  You're the worst plugger  Why were you even here?  Well, I'm just saying  First of all  I swear to God  You've been here four hours  And I do try to listen more than Sal  I don't know where you're playing tonight  I neither do I  That's what I'm saying  But the listeners at this point should know 
[03:14:00]  All I've got to do is go to Treehouse  Yeah, where am I at tonight?  You're at Lorenzo's in West Haven  Oh, my God  You didn't sell any tickets today  I did for Mohegan Sun  And Governors next week  I guess, but fuck  You didn't even know where you were today  That's why I said go to treehousecomedy.com  But when you were saying all that  I thought it was Treehouse is a comedy club  Well, treehousecomedy.com  If they went there  They would have saw where I am tonight  Okay  Lorenzo is in West Haven  And next week at Governors  My CD, Still Empty Inside  Which is up for a Grammy  Please get it 
[03:14:30]  Is it really?  Yeah  He's waiting for the compliment  And I'm not going to do it  So, Still Empty Inside  $6.94, huh?  $6.94, huh?  Uh-oh, you'd be up  No, I'd be probably exactly where I dumped out  After this oatmeal, I'm going to really do that read  Oh, Jesus  I can't look at it  I can't just keep looking at the fucking price now  $6.94  It's crazy  $2.3  Oh, boy  $6.95 is the big  $6.95 is like, ah 
[03:15:00]  You know, here's the thing, though  With the stocks  $6.94, $3.5  You're never going to buy in at the absolute low  And sell at the absolute high  That you're in there  You're just not going to do it  Well, I bought McDonald's in $73  Did you?  I sold in $74  How much?  I paid $12  You bought a burger  And why would this thing hit $6.95?  It will  No, but it's like teasing and then it drops back down 
[03:15:30]  It's a resistance point  It is, right?  It's hitting some resistance  It's $94  Yeah  $11  Yeah  But if it goes past the resistance point  Then it could start climbing high  Once a stock breaks through a point of resistance  It usually takes off to the next resistance  You know what?  Everyone's going to be watching the stock today for instance  You know what?  You can have made a lot of money  Remember years ago when 5-Hour Energy was just in 7-Eleven  Yeah  It's on every TV commercial  It's all over the fucking place 
[03:16:00]  I don't know what stock that is  It's a publicly traded company  I would assume  Who knows, right?  I don't have any idea  I don't buy stocks, by the way  I buy stock options  So I don't have to spend $695 for one share of Apple  I buy an option for $5  A share  How do you do that?  By buying an option  I buy an option  That says  Anthony  For $5 
[03:16:30]  I will give you the option  To buy the stock at $695  No matter what the price is  No matter what the price is  If you pay me $5  If you want to  Within the next month  I'll allow you to buy that stock at $695  And then let's say the stock goes up to $720  Then you can buy a million shares, right?  Well, I can only buy as many as I have an option to buy  Oh, okay  And then I can buy them at $695  Even though they're at $720 
[03:17:00]  And then immediately sell them at $720  Okay, so  That's how I make my money  Every option for $5  Is one time you could buy it  It depends  Yeah, yeah  And it depends on  What the price  Could be $5  It could be $20  Depending on how close to the real price you are  How far away  How far  How much time you want  To be able to exercise those options  But how do you lose?  How do you lose?  Let's say  It's too good to be true  Let's say I have the option to buy 100 shares at $695  And it never goes over $680 
[03:17:30]  And the amount of time that I have allotted to me  Oh, how long do you get?  It all depends  I could get a month  I could get two weeks  I could get six months if I want  But it costs more to buy one that's six months  It always costs you more to get more  So then if it doesn't go past what they call the strike price  Which would be $695  Then my options expire 
[03:18:00]  And I get nothing  So you lose every bit of money  Now you have no shares and no money  But how does she lose?  You lose however many shares you bought  100 shares  So let's say 100 shares at $5 a share  That's it?  Well, that's $5 a share  It depends how long he wants the option for  That's $5 a share though  It's, you know  How much were your shares for the Apple?  I bought in at those when it was  It was about $5 and something cents a share 
[03:18:30]  For how long?  So what was your initial investment?  It was until September 21st  Hold on  What was your initial investment  That you just turned around and made $18,000?  Oh, fuckload of shares, my friend  I bought a lot of contracts  Oh, I thought you just bought 100 shares  No, no  I was just using that as an example  Gotcha  No, I bought a lot more than 100  So there was absolute risk  Not shares, options  There was a lot of risk  Well, here's what he did  If he made like $18,000  And it went up, what?  $15?  Yeah  You probably bought like 1,000 fucking shares 
[03:19:00]  It was a lot  Yeah  He doesn't want to say it for real  Well, that's what it's  I mean, it's basically  It's easy to figure it out  We could do the math  All right, let's get out of here  You have to do that or no?
