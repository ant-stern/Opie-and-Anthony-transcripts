<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous, over-the-top prayer and a bizarre discussion about a children's movie, "Mr. Bungle," described using offensive and stereotypical language.  The hosts then speculated about a mysterious substance on their studio window, jokingly suggesting it was semen.  The bulk of the early show focused on their Comic-Con trip, recounting humorous anecdotes, including a mistaken identity incident at a restaurant and a planned, slightly deceptive interaction with Chevy Chase resulting in a photo opportunity.  They also unexpectedly met Don Cheadle and recorded a short interview.  Numerous audio clips from the trip were played, including an interview with Elijah Wood (who didn't recognize Jim Norton), Sam Roberts inserting himself into a G4 interview, and highly offensive audio of a fan, Cass, loudly proclaiming her love for Dimitri Martin while insulting E-Rock with highly personal and offensive comments.  The hosts discussed the clips at length, particularly Cass's outburst.  Technical difficulties with one host's phone, specifically with video and sound quality, were also noted.  The "This Day in History" segment included a discussion of incorrect birthday and anniversary information.  The Comic-Con discussion continued, culminating in a promotion of an upcoming Comic-Con special.

The show then shifted to the hosts' ongoing complaints about their studio's terrible lighting.  Management's "solution"—two extremely bright LED panel lights—proved disastrous, blinding everyone and causing significant disruption.  Opie even threw one light in the trash.  The extreme brightness became a running gag, affecting anyone walking past the studio.  The hosts speculated about the fallout with management.  They also briefly discussed complaints about the online feed and attempted to Morse code "suck a dick" using the lights.  Jimmy Norton's return from a trip was marked by a gift of a flash drive containing pornography. Doug Stanhope and Andrew Dice Clay were announced as upcoming guests.

E-Rock's anger and frustration over Cass's offensive comments at Comic-Con dominated a subsequent segment.  The conversation became heated and derailed frequently, with several crude and offensive comments from the hosts and callers, including homophobic and racial slurs.  Jokes about E-Rock's weight were made. A caller, Don, used homophobic slurs. The hosts speculated about seeing Mike Tyson near the studio and discussed a supposed Justin Bieber song containing a racial slur.  A fake advertisement for a sex advice product featuring Andrew Dice Clay was played.

Doug Stanhope arrived in-studio.  The conversation turned to feelings of apathy and burnout, the passage of time, and Stanhope's negative experiences in the UK, his views on English food, and his dislike of certain celebrity chefs.  Jimmy Norton called in to discuss appearances on John Stossel's show and other media engagements.  The conversation shifted to Amy Winehouse's death, her struggles with addiction, and comparisons to other musicians who died young.  Substance abuse anecdotes, including those regarding Mitch Hedberg, were shared.  The hosts and guests discussed their careers, salaries, and personal frustrations before the segment ended abruptly.

Doug Stanhope further recounted his experience auditioning for Louis C.K.'s show, describing the role as a "loser, washed-up shit bag" and detailing his audition strategy. He also described his low-maintenance lifestyle in Arizona, focusing on his low property taxes and relaxed work schedule.  A lengthy discussion on cable providers, heavily criticizing Time Warner and praising Fios, followed, including anecdotes about interactions with cable company representatives.  Andrew Dice Clay arrived late with his wife and ex-fiancée.  The conversation then shifted to Dice's career, including his *Entourage* appearances, a near-million-dollar gambling spree, and his new manager.  The discussion included vulgar language and sexually explicit jokes about his relationships, children, and comedy act.

The show continued with Dice Clay recounting boastful and outrageous anecdotes, including shoplifting stories, his views on complimenting other men's wives, details of his relationships (including his current and past relationship with Eleanor), an encounter with Mickey Rourke, his preference for sexting, his dislike of his audience, and a fight with Kenny.  Eleanor, Bruce, and Kenny were present in the studio, although Kenny was mostly silent.  The conversation was filled with profanity, sexually suggestive remarks, and vulgar humor.

The final segment featured Andrew Dice Clay discussing sexually explicit and crude humor, his views on women's sexuality, his reluctance to use social media, and his preference for an old "Commando" phone.  A significant portion promoted his upcoming show in Brooklyn, including details about ticket sales and the venue.  He expressed disdain for modern trends and conformity.  The show concluded abruptly with Opie and Anthony leaving for a break, leaving Sam Roberts to briefly apologize to a staff member, "Iraq," for a previous Comic-Con audio clip.  Promotional information for Opie and Anthony and upcoming shows concluded the broadcast.

[00:02:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Anthony Show, right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hogged.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly, not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  Look at that.  And you know what?  Yeah.  I want to thank Mars right off the bat.  Right off the bat?  For not touching anything. 
[00:04:30]  No.  This microphone I bitched about yesterday?  Yeah.  This fucking thing sounds great.  Is it kicking ass now?  Too bad it's me who's talking through it.  It's doing well?  Jimmy loves that.  Yeah, it sounds fucking awesome.  I guess that's because he traded ours.  Mine sounds like crap.  No, I'm kidding.  He just throws his arms up in the air.  He threw his arms like a motherfucker.  Nah.  I love the Mars. 
[00:05:00]  But my microphone.  Mr. Microphone.  Hi, everybody.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy Norton.  Back from L.A.  Hello.  In San Diego.  Are you opening up the envelopes?  Yeah, I got mail.  Fan mail from some flounder?  That dickhead blew us off.  I'm so annoyed.  He did?  Peewee blew you off?  I think he canceled everybody.  Fuck Peewee.  No, I think he's just a little...  It's cute you came back with your little fucking bow tie, but enough already.  No one's going to bring up his jerking off in a movie theater.  I don't think it was that.  I think he's just a little flaky. 
[00:05:30]  And if they did, at this point, you got something on it, right?  You're a comedian.  Fucking spin that shit and go with it.  Well, he was completely in character, so he doesn't break character.  Fuck Peewee.  He's not Paul Rubens.  Honestly, I was excited he came back and all that, yes.  But fuck him at this point.  Enough already.  Why isn't he talking to people?  It just annoys me.  I don't know.  Who the fuck does he think he is?  Peewee Herman.  Yeah.  And what does that mean?  I don't know.  My bitch of the Yo Gabba Gabba people aren't going to blow us off. 
[00:06:00]  Have they ever beat off in a movie theater?  No, but their characters look like dildos and stuff.  They do look like various sexual toys and implements of destruction.  Yeah, I might have to.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm just getting on nothing.  It's a hard drive.  Oh, nice.  Candy.  What?  You got a gift?  What size?  Is it a birthday gift?  20 gig?  It's a flesh drive. 
[00:06:30]  From who?  It's so nice.  I don't know.  Is it a birthday?  A porn company?  Uh-oh.  Oh, wow.  There might be some porn on there.  Girls Next Door.  Thank you.  Oh, it's four gigs.  20 plus videos.  This seat.  Look at this.  I'm looking at a very little package.  Yeah.  It's a little bigger than a pack of playing cards.  The entire package.  It's just a flash drive in here.  That's the plastic that goes around it. 
[00:07:00]  And this is what would be, in the old days, a videotape.  And this is what you would jerk off to.  And now you just pop the flash drive in.  You got more than 20 videos of pornography.  So this would have been 20 VHR tapes.  I don't know if it was like...  Oh, let's get a pause, because it's VHR tapes, right?  VHS.  VHS.  VHS.  I don't...  Wow.  VCR.  VCR.  VCR.  Holy crap.  It's been so long.  I couldn't figure it out anymore.  I know.  Who the fuck even sees these things anymore?  I should have went with just DVD, but I mean, 20 DVDs, you can almost still throw that in 
[00:07:30]  your back pocket.  I don't know.  I was going old school when we first started checking out porn.  Yeah, I guess it depends on how long the videos are, but...  But that's amazing.  You just throw that...  Yeah, it's just...  That's the future now.  No one would know you're walking around with like 20 to 40 hours of smut in your pocket.  I remember years ago, pulling that out when everybody had like VCRs, and you'd go,  hey, you know what?  There's smut on here, and I can't wait until something's invented to play it on.  Yeah.  But you would be like, wow, I got a lot of smut on this. 
[00:08:00]  This is from marydirtydeeds.com.  I've never been to this site, but thank you, Mary.  Oh, boy.  Very much.  I hope they arrest you for just denouncing that site.  Ah, no.  It's probably a horrible...  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine you're fucking popping it in and it's all bestiality and kiddie porn?  I don't fucking upload to it.  I just jerk off to it.  Yay.  So thank you, man.  That's very cool.  Yeah, it was a nice little gift to come back to.  Yeah.  I got very good news, Anthony. 
[00:08:30]  You know we bitch a lot on this show.  Well, um...  Some of the listeners can't stand it.  I understand your pain, but I don't know what else to do.  Look, it's very rare, and few and far between.  But we get updates.  Because remember, our new thing is to bitch, but also suggest solutions.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Like yesterday, I bitched about the microphone, and it's fixed.  And it got fixed.  It's fixed.  And that's because of Mars.  It didn't have to go through all kinds of channels, I bet. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, by the way, the online feed is horrendous today.  Oh.  It sounds like we're underwater.  That's what I woke up today.  But we meant to do that.  A million of those tweets.  And a million of those tweets yesterday afternoon.  Are we going to give out the email?  The complaint email?  Oh, boy.  I believe it has been registered.  I cannot confirm or deny whether or not the intended parties will receive the email.  All right.  Have Travis come in if it's set up.  Because people have complaints.  And only use it for real complaints. 
[00:09:30]  Don't fuck around.  Because honestly, we are trying to make things better.  I know it doesn't sound like it sometimes.  Oh.  Well, what's the scoop?  Remember, we wanted to fix up the studio a little bit.  Do you remember?  Yeah, yeah.  I remember.  There were certain things that we wanted for the studio.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And remember, one of them was to get better lighting in here.  Remember, your coat hooks.  That took a while.  Oh, yeah.  Look. 
[00:10:00]  But they ended up there.  That took a while.  That took quite a while.  Because they were worried, what?  It was going to change the sound of the room or something?  Yeah, it was something ridiculous.  They couldn't agree on a distributor for, I don't know.  And then the black coverings on the walls.  That looks nice now.  That took a while, but it...  Even though they decided, ah, fuck it.  It's good enough.  Because they were behind Jimmy.  It makes it back there.  And then they forget about the door and everything.  What are you going to do?  The Yon City sign.  It's funny.  I just saw that. 
[00:10:30]  What?  The Yon City.  The Yon City Junction?  Oh, that just came in.  Oh, okay.  A listener made a couple signs.  Yon City.  What's the other one?  I'll tell you.  I forgot already.  Yon City.  But I was telling Ant before the show...  Oh, meeting ahead with a saddy face.  That these signs would be for down the hall.  And I know if we put them up, they're going to take them down immediately.  Of course they would.  See, what we needed was Yon City like 200 feet this way.  Right, right.  Like in MASH.  Well, when you're on vacation.  Or the MASH thing. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  5,000 miles.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah.  So one of the things was to get proper lighting in studio.  Proper lighting.  Because we're all shooting video and shooting pictures.  And just in general, we want better lights.  Because every time I look up and then look at Anthony, he's just a black blob.  We have what I think these are just your standard...  Are they incandescent floodlights?  Probably.  That's what I'm thinking.  Very harsh.  Very bright.  Very spotty.  Mm-hmm.  You know, it doesn't give you a very balanced light. 
[00:11:30]  And in photographs and video, they do throw off a reddish hue.  Yeah.  And just washes people out.  Yes.  It just doesn't look professional at all.  And in this new world with all the social networking and stuff, we could share a lot of  cool stuff with people.  But we want it to look right.  So that was the idea.  I suggested just some gels to soften these lights up.  Color gels would work.  I don't know lighting, but I would assume something like that might be a nice fix, right? 
[00:12:00]  If you could get some color gels in here, put them over the lights, it would make the  atmosphere a lot nicer.  Right.  And we have to turn the lights down on the dimmer just to get it to a place where if  we do look up, there's still spots in front of your face.  Yeah, yeah, when I turn my head around, sometimes I look at Sam and then I look down, I can't  see.  Are we all in agreement that's what we wanted?  Because I don't want to exaggerate anything here.  No, that's what we're in agreement that we wanted.  That's pretty much what we wanted.  Maybe some gels to soften up the room, right? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, color gels on the existing lights would be fine.  That's what we said a million times, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Easy to do.  Easy workaround.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce our new light.  I want to introduce our new light.  Now, let me give you a little preface here.  Like I said, solutions to the problems are happening around us, young Sam.  Can I give the people a preface before this?  Oh, boy.  He did turn the big.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  So you're almost young now.  I want to preface this by saying, Obi did say that something was going on with the lights  or light or something right when I came in.  He goes, do you want to know about it now or wait for on the air?  And I was like, I want to wait for on the air.  Okay.  Because I want to be completely surprised and happy.  By this solution.  Yeah.  That I assume is a solution, right?  Yeah.  I'm turning over a new stone, man.  I'm going to talk about the solutions as well as the problems on our show. 
[00:13:30]  The solutions.  You talked about the microphone today.  I present you with our new light that's going to solve the problem.  No, stop.  What?  It's a solution.  I've got to take my headphones off.  I want to know everything about this.  Oh, shit.  Should I just stand up?  Oh, no.  Where's it going to be?  Oh, my.  I'm already seeing a fucking bracket.  It'll probably be over here somewhere.  All right.  I present to the audience the solution to the problem. 
[00:14:00]  That is an LED panel light.  And wouldn't you assume it would be up here somewhere?  I would assume.  All right.  Let me just put it up here just for test purposes.  It's going to fall.  It's going to fall.  All right.  I have to hold it.  Yeah.  All right.  Ready?  Okay.  You want me to turn on the new light?  Please.  Okay.  It's just like a floor tile.  This is the solution they came up with.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that's from them?  Yes.  Where would that go?  Right there.  For everyone.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All I can equate this to, picture a nuclear-powered light bright.  Remember light bright when you were a kid?  It's like that with 50,000 fucking watts each little bulb.  Picture, picture.  We have two.  Two of them.  We have two.  Picture, you know, trying to land a plane and you don't know where you're going. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's like talking to the ship in Close Encounters.  Yeah.  I know what these are.  I'm very astute when it comes to lighting.  What this is for is for video, but not like live, like in the studio kind of video.  This is for a shoot.  Oh!  Oh!  These are set up when you're shooting video.  And then when you're done, they're turned off. 
[00:15:30]  But this is crazy.  Why are you squinting?  Because I cannot even turn my head to look at it.  What?  Speaking of Close Encounters, I'm going to have one of those half sideburns like Dreyfus had  because he stuck his head out the window of his truck.  What?  It's a solution to our problem.  Wow.  That is fucking unbelievably bright.  Yeah.  Those lights are very handy.  How big are they?  I would love to steal those and take them home for the compound. 
[00:16:00]  That would light a green screen very nicely.  Nice, even lighting.  I just lit.  The light is 18 inches by 18 inches, I would assume.  An 18 inch by 18 inch square.  And you turn it on.  I was behind the light, by the way.  I'm blind.  Yeah, yeah.  And I wasn't even looking into it.  Like, Jimmy had to and you had to.  I'm blinking.  I'm seeing so many dots.  So many brightly colored dots.  It's great. 
[00:16:30]  That was the solution?  Yeah.  Now, that's why I go home right away.  Look, I appreciate the effort, but there's a complete lack of understanding as to what  we needed or wanted.  I did say that we need better.  I enjoy understanding.  Understanding.  I did say we need better lighting in here for pictures and video.  Yes.  I did say that.  Yes.  Because they're going to spin it on me now.  But we're talking about these lights for every day when we're in here doing our radio 
[00:17:00]  show.  So we want better lights.  And then when we do take video and pictures, it comes out, you know, crisper or whatever.  These lights can be covered with gels and then you can just crank the lights up like all  the way.  Right.  And it'll have like whatever we need for the picture.  Maybe a little rose colored gel to add a little, you know, color to everybody, a little more  neutral color.  Something maybe a little bluish to wash out the red. 
[00:17:30]  But you just got new lights.  But how did it, how did it, how did it, how did this get lost in translation?  Like what are we, Marge, seriously, what are we supposed to do with this?  Shine that right on me.  Because this is, shine that right on me.  I got to see what this looks like.  Because I really tried not to shine it on anyone.  Shine it right on me.  Because I don't want.  Go ahead.  That's right.  That's terrible.  That's right on Jimmy.  This is.  That's right on Anthony.  It's like Hiroshima.  I'm looking at my camera view here.  I swear, it looks like a blast just went off. 
[00:18:00]  Hang on, shine it on Ant and let me take a picture and let me see if it's effective.  Ah!  It's like.  Ah!  Marge, what are we supposed to do with these lights?  My shadow is burnt in the back wall.  Like Hiroshima.  Also, I noticed there's no, there's no clamp.  So, where are the clamps to these things so we can set them up?  Right, unfortunately.  Clamp schmamp, Opie. 
[00:18:30]  Unfortunately, the order was not completed.  It's back ordered.  There is no clamp.  I have to modify some type of clamping device, I guess.  You know what Puerto Rican means by that?  Hanger.  Yeah.  A wire hanger.  Exactly.  Gaffers tape it to the ceiling.  Yes.  Are you going to have to, Mars, are you going to have to rig it?  Yeah.  Puerto Rican rig.  We call it a presidential solution these days.  Oh, really?  Is that the new one?  Yes.  For the record, the picture is well lit. 
[00:19:00]  Let me see.  Holy Jesus.  See, that's the translation.  Oh, my God.  It looks like, it definitely looks like.  Let me see.  Wow.  That's beautiful.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't see anything.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  But I don't know.  Who fucked up this time?  Yeah.  Who fucked up this time?  You know, I don't know, but you, in their defense.  They're going to say, well, you wanted lights for video.  And no, that was part of it.  I know.  It's so hard to look at. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  Thank you.  Oh.  It's a fucking weapon.  It's a weapon.  Like, I need more weapons.  Oh, my God.  All right, I'll put the solution back down here.  Oh, that is fantastic.  So it doesn't hurt anybody.  I could give you the second one, and you could have a weapon yourself.  That would be great.  We got a light fight.  Oh, light duels.  You know, we could just have light duels. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And I'm not even mad.  This one is so silly.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, there are things that happen that are so silly, you can't be mad.  How are you mad by how incompetent that is?  You can't be.  Huh?  You can't be mad at that.  That's just hilarious.  It's hilarious.  And I'm just thinking, okay, something, let's say, like, remember when Jesse Ventura walked  off the show?  Yeah.  And we're filming video, right?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:20:30]  So it's time to film video, because we know we have something.  Uh-huh.  So we have to turn on those fucking lights.  Yeah.  That's going to distract everybody.  Yeah.  You don't want the giant distraction when you're taking pictures or video.  Because we want it to be in the natural atmosphere.  Right.  Of the studio.  We don't want people to go, oh, it's TV time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Time to perform.  Yeah.  Time to perform.  Go ahead.  Here's fucking 80,000 watts of light.  That's like, the last time I saw that was when I went to the garden and Kiss lit up that 
[00:21:00]  big kiss behind him.  And I just went like, ow.  That hurt.  They're lighting this little studio like it's a giant room.  You don't treat a little, you don't make a little studio a giant room.  We just wanted some gels for everyday radio use.  And then if we do, this is exactly what I said, I know.  And then if we do take pictures or video, they come out a little nicer.  That's all I asked for, for us.  Yeah, but they took it up a notch. 
[00:21:30]  Took it up.  I'm still blind.  And I'm behind the light.  So I can't even imagine what Ant's looking like right now.  Oh, my God.  Let me make sure.  It's fascinating.  I want to just make sure.  It really is great.  Maybe we're the assholes.  Maybe if you tilt it up.  Maybe tilt it up.  Ah!  No?  Tilt it up again.  It's not as bad up.  It's okay up, but most people won't be taking photos up there.  Yeah.  If you want to take a picture of the ceiling tile.  And then it looks like the sun is coming through the ceiling.  Yeah, the light's creepy that way. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, wow.  That is something.  That looks like TV lighting, though.  Yeah, it is.  Because we're being lit, but not directly by light.  When you shine it up like that, that's like TV lighting.  By the way, this is something we asked for months and months and months.  I don't even know.  Those are something else.  Oh, fuck.  I think I just broke it.  Oh, no.  How much does this cost, Mars?  They didn't spare any cost.  These are expensive.  Yeah, those are very expensive.  More or less.  More or less.  Ballpark.  I would say those lights go for anywhere between $15,000 and $2,000. 
[00:22:30]  Expensive.  Yeah, those are very expensive.  More or less.  More or less.  Ballpark.  I would say those lights go for anywhere between $15,000 and $2,000.  They're up there.  I don't want to say a number because it would be incorrect.  I don't know.  I know they're expensive.  I think it's anywhere between $15,000 and $2,000.  Oh, brother.  Yeah.  What does this mean now? 
[00:23:00]  Gary's going to have to justify the lights and make believe that it's our problem?  That would be great if we were doing a TV show from here.  No, you can't do that.  How do you do that?  Well, you would definitely turn them up like that.  Up a little bit.  Reflective light.  Right.  You could put also egg crate filter on those so it's not as direct in your face.  Can they be used for everyday use?  Like, I want the lights to change so they're on constantly. 
[00:23:30]  Can you keep these on constantly?  No, they're not really made to stay on all the time.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's completely wrong?  Yeah.  It's completely wrong.  What?  It's just the way you phrased it.  Completely wrong.  I so want to give somebody credit around here, but once again, I would have to put this in  the fail category. 
[00:24:00]  That's a smaller one.  The smaller one is, yeah.  Is what?  It's already over a thousand.  It's already over a grand.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a two thousand.  All right.  It's nice that they spared no expense.  The lights that they're going to have to send back or use for something else.  I saw those same lights.  Yeah, there's one.  Yeah, 1539.  I know my lights.  I've been studying.  Yeah, but you did say between 15 and 2000, which means that you were either $39 off, almost 
[00:24:30]  $5,000 off.  But it depends on where you buy it.  Oh, okay.  That's a good guess, man.  I've seen those lights in the studio they use for the Stern after show.  Yes, sir.  They use that.  But they're videoing.  They have a professional camera set up there also.  That's correct.  Yeah.  They got a television show.  Yeah, it's a television show going on.  One of two.  Yeah, so they kind of need that.  Mm-hmm.  All right, what do we do?  I must say I am digging those, though, for maybe some green screen lighting. 
[00:25:00]  This is good that I was able to see how bright these fuckers are.  This is good.  So I turn that back and put it on the green screen.  Wow, there goes Opie.  Where are you going?  Where are you going with that, Opie?  Opie!  You don't want it?  No!  He just put it in the garbage.  He just put the fucking $1,500 light in the garbage.  In the trash can.  It's nice right there.  Send it back. 
[00:25:30]  We can't use those.  We could use those maybe, but we need, you know what we need.  Or maybe you don't, I guess, because they didn't do it properly.  It's simple.  Either, there's, what amounts to over $3,000 in lights in this room right now because of  these two lights.  Right.  $3,000.  And it was a problem.  The solution we wanted was go to a lighting place, get some color gels for probably what  would have been $15 to $20.  Really? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they even said we're getting someone involved that knows lighting.  See, don't do that.  I remember they said that.  You don't have to do that.  Can we just not get people involved?  We need lights that we could turn on as soon as we get here at whatever.  That's it.  548.  And turn them on and do a radio show.  And then if we shoot video or pictures, they look good.  Get a dozen gels and some scrunchies and I will make this fucking place perfect.  Really?  Yeah.  That's all it is?  Yes.  It's perfect. 
[00:26:30]  Is somebody going to be disappointed today?  Sam?  Yeah.  I mean, I think they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think disappointment's a good word.  I think probably the idea was...  My new favorite thing is to put Sam in a corner, by the way.  Oh, I know.  Because he is always...  You've got to answer the questions.  Yeah, you're asking.  Why are people going to be disappointed today?  Well, I think that the idea was that something...  There's complaints that nothing ever gets accomplished from management for the show. 
[00:27:00]  And the position of management would probably yesterday have been that we accomplished something  well because we took something that was asked and we not only gave it to you, but gave it  to you to the next level.  Sam, Sam, I understand what you're saying.  Yeah.  But riddle me this.  You know management probably better than I do at this point.  Having to deal with them once a week asking for your raise.  But, but, I want to know, what's the scenario when they order those lights? 
[00:27:30]  Is it, is it, it's one of two.  Sure.  Is it, this is great, we got lights for the guys, it's going to be a good thing.  Or is it, we got lights, but you know they're just going to shit on us.  Well, I...  What is it?  I think up to a year ago, it would have been, alright, we're all moving, we're a team, we're  a team, right.  And this time it was like, alright, we got the lights, hopefully they will shut the fuck  up tomorrow. 
[00:28:00]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is basically snatching, uh, victory, this is snatching a defeat out of the jaws of  victory.  Yes, yes.  They just had a victory and this is pulling a defeat right out of it.  Because what happened was, not only, like, you guys could have said, alright, we got  lights, they did spend money and their intentions were good, but they're the wrong lights.  Instead, Opie threw the lights in the garbage and stated, what was it they did, nothing is  right about this? 
[00:28:30]  Nothing is right about this.  This is completely wrong.  Hey, completely wrong.  I need backup on this.  It's not, it's not even close to right.  Yeah.  I don't mean it's just you.  This is probably the worst solution to the lighting problem they could have came up with.  Darkness would have been a better solution.  Okay, see.  Right, okay, fine.  Right above darkness is what they just did.  I just saw a camera move on MSNBC for the Morning Joe's show.  Yeah.  Where they show, like, some of the upper part of the ceiling.  Same lights, right?  Come down.  Two of the same exact lights.  Of course.  Shining on a television show. 
[00:29:00]  I know.  That is lit like the sun.  I know they, I know they did their research and said, okay, these are the best lights for  doing TV or video or whatnot.  At Comic Con.  But the problem is that's not what we asked for.  G4 had those lights, you know, for the shoots.  Yeah, if you turn those lights on and videotape something.  You want to turn them on again?  No.  It will look amazing.  Sure.  You have to white balance the camera.  Sure.  Turn the iris.  Of course.  You know, you've got to scrunch that thing down a little bit.  Of course.  But it'll look amazing.  Yeah, but no one will do anything because they're going to be blinded. 
[00:29:30]  Yes, exactly.  They're going to look good, but they're going to look like a deer looking in headlights.  What's that?  See, what you guys wanted was just a radio studio where you could take out a camcorder  or a flip cam and just shoot a decent video.  Yeah.  Whereas management said, we're going to make them extra happy and take steps to actually  turn the radio studio into a television set, which then was met with, number one, you  did everything wrong, and number two, from Jim, darkness would have been better. 
[00:30:00]  That's why, that's where the sort of sadness and disappointment will come into play.  They're just dopes.  They're just dopes.  My God.  Don't grab me after every fucking show.  Oh, you don't even know how to listen.  And I know you didn't literally, like, I know you're not throwing the light in the garbage  for them to take it to the dump, but the symbolism of taking the 50-meter out of the 
[00:30:30]  light and dropping it in the trash can.  They're basically feeling good about themselves, and you're saying, no, you're incompetent bunglers.  Right, right, right.  You're bungled yet again.  Like, this statement that you gave us to say, we are willing to spend the money to take  the show to the next level, I say, is household garbage.  Yeah, you can spend your money, but you didn't spend it wisely.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You spent too much on a free agent we didn't need.  Yes.  Look at the lights Mr. Bungle bought.  Mr. Bungle bought the wrong lights. 
[00:31:00]  Real management would have nice lights.  Good lights that the boys could use.  Not Mr. Bungle.  At this point, he's a joke.  At this point, that guy's a joke.  It's hilarious.  It's great.  I can't wait for the excuse today.  But Ant's right.  I mean, videos, like I said, the picture that I took of Ant looked great.  Videos will look great if we use those lights.  Please find me audio of us talking about the lighting situation so I can back up my point 
[00:31:30]  today that all we wanted was some kind of gels or something that we could have on the entire  show so it feels nice and softer in here.  Softer.  We could turn up the lights.  We have to turn these things down so low.  I'm going to say it again.  Because as soon as you look up and look back down, everyone is blotchy.  Okay?  Yeah.  And then you get some gels I suggested.  But I said, I don't really know about lighting.  I know what I want or we want.  Yeah.  Maybe some gels would take care of the situation.  We'd turn up the lights a little more every morning. 
[00:32:00]  And then when we film stuff, it would look pretty nice.  That's all I said.  That's all.  That's all.  And now we have TV lights that we can only turn on when maybe we're videotaping.  Or want to, you know, tan.  Right.  What if we're doing surgery?  Or surgery.  Surgery.  That's good.  I want lighting for a Quincy episode.  Sam, put some more light on this.  I want everything to be translucent.  Can we set up the lights so they're facing down the long hall and just bother everyone? 
[00:32:30]  I just want to bother everyone today.  Oh, my God.  Please.  And then watch the faces of everyone walking up the hall.  They're going to be squinting.  Yes.  And their hands will be up.  I cannot tell you people out there how bright these lights are.  And who wants to have a contest?  How long it takes for them to demand we turn off the light?  Because it's going to be an HR issue.  Oh, this is fantastic.  Let's play that, too.  No one's here yet.  So I think we can get away with it for another half hour.  Tip it up a little bit.  Yeah.  Just so.  Oh, my God.  Let's see what this is like. 
[00:33:00]  Eric.  Eric.  There you go.  Look at the hallway.  There you go.  It's lit up like the sun.  It's lit up like a fucking runway.  Eric has made a suggestion.  You can light a plane in there.  Hey, wow.  What?  Can we make Eric run down the hallway making the vroom sound?  Vroom.  Sorry, Rob.  Travis, how obnoxious is it?  It's incredibly annoying.  Really?  Well, Eric has suggested that we leave the light off until we see someone in the hallway.  Oh, shit.  And then click it on right when they're in rain. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, he's right.  Somebody stays on light duty all day.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone's got to be on light duty.  Can we put it up higher?  Yeah.  Maybe get a little, I don't know.  That's hysterical.  Do you know what?  I see the reflection of the light now at the other end of the building in those windows.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  You can see it.  How many feet is that?  You can see it way down by the conference room.  That's easily 150 feet.  It's one city block.  This building is a whole city block.  You're right.  It's one city block away, and it's reflecting, like, just as bright as it is in this room. 
[00:34:00]  No, that's not the light.  Yes, it is.  That's the light?  Turn it off for a second.  It's reflecting on...  Holy shit!  Dude, it's a city block.  Get the fuck out of here.  Sam is laughing.  We put both lights on.  Sam can't look.  People are already mad.  See, you want me to go all the way down there and tell you how far down it goes?  They don't like anyone having fun around here, so this will be a problem.  Oh, this is going to be a definite problem.  This will be a problem by 730.  One of the guys just came out of one of the offices way down at the end of the hallway, 
[00:34:30]  pointing at me as if to say, oh, that's what that is.  It's way down at the end.  You could see it just as brightly down at the management end.  Oh, my God.  You're on the city.  Jim suggested I put the second light up as well.  Yeah, we should do both lights and then someone on light detail where the second someone starts  walking down, flip on and fucking like a phaser attack.  Oh, Jim's on 10.  It just disintegrates.  We got a little Jimmy Norton down the hall.  A little Jimmy Norton's about 100 to 120 feet away at this point. 
[00:35:00]  What's up, Jimmy?  No, I'm not looking back.  I'm walking all the way down to where Scott and Blatter's office are, which is like  a city block, but I did turn around halfway down the hall, and it was no less bright than  it was sitting five feet away.  Are you serious?  Fantastic.  Look, there's two of them now.  Oh, my God.  It's the brightest thing I've ever seen in my life.  And people are walking away from the lights, and they just don't want to be bothered by us.  The morning mashup, whoever's walking down the hall is in my way, so I cannot see. 
[00:35:30]  All right, they have quite a silhouette behind them.  If someone thinks they're dying, they're going to walk right into those.  Oh, they're fucking out.  These people are still walking towards me.  All right, hold on.  They'll turn in a second.  That is hilarious.  Yeah, they're all taking a slow walk here.  But I can see it reflecting off the glass office windows.  It's so...  It's reflecting...  The thing is, these studios in here, everything's glass. 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  Everything is fucking glass.  So it's reflecting and bouncing off of everything.  Dude, it's horrible.  Like, I can see from here.  How many do you have lit?  One or two?  We put up both now.  Two are lit.  Dude, I can only...  I can see Mars putting the other one down.  Yeah.  It is distractingly bad.  I love this.  I'm standing, I'm in the corner, and I'm at the door of Scott's office, and I'm as far  as I can go, and it is almost as bright as if I was sitting right there in the office. 
[00:36:30]  It's horrible.  Oh, my God.  Holy God.  Is that fantastic?  I can't look...  I'll even take a picture.  I can't look at the reflection of it in the glass.  No.  Without getting, like, the spots in my eyes.  I'm seeing it over there, and I don't even know how that's possible.  I'm seeing it in another corner.  We're like in a prism.  So, Jimmy's saying it's just as bad a city block away, like you pointed out.  One city block away.  It is a city block away.  This hallway is direct.  Yeah.  So you could be a city block away and still see Jimmy. 
[00:37:00]  The width of this building, which takes up an entire city block.  And our studio is maybe...  I don't even think it's 20 feet by 20 feet.  Oh, my God.  And they want to turn those fuckers on in here.  This is hilarious.  I can't even fucking tell you how...  They just don't understand anything.  They can't figure out the basics.  Yeah, we wanted mood lighting, and they gave us fucking, like, movie lights. 
[00:37:30]  When you're filming a movie.  Idiots!  Oh, come on.  If I was him, I swear to God, I would just quit.  I would have some pride and just quit.  And make believe, like, his family is starting up a business or something.  Like, I'm leaving in two weeks.  It was fun working with you guys.  Because he's an idiot!  See, the problem with this is the reaction to these lights is actually worse than your reaction yesterday when you didn't have the lights.  Well, they finally came up with a solution, I would guess, at least six months after we first brought it up. 
[00:38:00]  More or less.  I don't know.  We're looking for the date.  Okay.  Jimmy's head is now turning.  Jimmy can't even look at these lights.  We've got to tip them up a little, I think, with what he's going to say.  They've got to be tipped up a little bit.  They've got to be tipped up, right?  The one, for some reason, this one is not as bad.  But I wish I had my good camera with me because I took a photo from down the hall.  Yeah.  It's just, can you, I don't know if you can, this does it justice.  I hope not.  Because it looks like it's, but literally, this is from Scott's office.  That's how, it's fucking horrible. 
[00:38:30]  That's a city block away.  That's a city block away.  Yeah.  You can't really get the distance.  Oh, that does it justice.  But you literally can't, it's distracting because it's like someone taking a quarter  and having it brightly reflect in your face from glimpsing off the sun.  Oh, now it's, yeah.  Okay, this is an eclipse.  Oh, it's rolling.  Oh, you could adjust the volume.  Yeah.  Turn it all the way up.  All the way up.  Oh, my God.  Well, maybe we're supposed to adjust the volume.  It's got to be, what is it?  Oh, yeah, we could have probably just turned that down, right? 
[00:39:00]  30 by 30.  Oh, no, it would still be in your eyes and very distracting as far as trying to do a radio  show goes.  That's the point.  When you're on TV, you know you're on TV.  They fucking light the whole guy in place with these things, and it is tough to look  at certain spots in a TV studio.  Look, Kenny's coming down.  It looks like that shot of Godzilla when they light him up to hit him with missiles.  You want to see them dimmed down?  Yeah.  That's what it looks like.  All right, so what is it?  That's all the way down?  That's still light, right? 
[00:39:30]  That's all the way down?  No, that's horrible.  Is anyone in the room?  Yeah.  You turn all the way up.  It is.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  There we go.  That's nice.  Maybe that's how it lights the room nicely, a little reflection off the glass.  Right.  There.  See, that's perfect.  How does this end?  We'll tell them.  By the way, we should tell them that we figured out that's the best way this works, is to put  it down the hall because it reflects off the window and throws a nice light here so we need  it like that. 
[00:40:00]  So everyone that walks down the hall just gets fucking flamed.  This is such an obnoxious show.  I was thinking of that as I was walking up the hallway.  Just what dicks we are.  Here comes the mashup crew, I think.  I can't tell.  I can't say.  We wonder why everybody hates us.  Fuck.  Yeah, man.  Who gives a fuck?  They're walking down the hall now.  They can't believe the amount of light that's...  How does this end, though?  They're going to force us to turn off our lights, right?  Now that we're doing a little bit. 
[00:40:30]  You're shining two giant studio lights into the hallway of a building, so I think...  But who's going to come to Travis and go, you know...  I probably...  I know.  I understand the guys were having a...  Listen, today especially, I just found out from Troy that the side hall...  Yeah.  That you would go...  If you go down this hallway and take a left...  Right.  That's blocked, so everybody has to come down this hallway. 
[00:41:00]  These guys are...  Oh, nice.  These guys won't even acknowledge that the lights are on.  They're blinking.  They're blinking a lot.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We keep them on.  So there you go.  I mean, it does look better in here with the light reflected off the glass.  A little bit.  A little bit better.  It's nice.  Holy shit.  I can't even fucking...  It's mind-boggling.  I don't get it.  I don't get how you can be so incompetent and have a gig. 
[00:41:30]  Well, they're making an effort.  How is this making an effort?  This is the...  Like Jimmy said, it's the worst solution possible besides darkness.  Actually, Jim...  This is just above darkness as a solution.  Jim asserted that darkness would be preferable to these lights.  Darkness better.  Roland's coming down the hall now.  Oh, my God.  At least we can see who's coming down the hall clearly.  Oh, yeah.  And they can't see us.  No, it's true.  Okay, guys.  You had to find, but can you turn off the lights? 
[00:42:00]  People are trying to work.  We definitely have the advantage.  Holy shit.  There's giant studio lights shining down the hallway.  Yeah, you know Morse code?  Can we Morse code suck a dick?  Get suck a dick up there, Morse code.  Let's try it.  Okay.  We're talking to management. 
[00:42:30]  There we go.  All right.  Hey, assholes.  The lights aren't working.  We only needed gels.  That's what this is telling them.  Okay.  They're answering back.  We thought this was a good solution.  We're understanding each other.  And they all come out of the ship, and they all look like Gary.  Take that, Baldy.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:43:00]  Fucking had it.  I'm done.  Oh, shit.  Fucking done.  They can't even figure out lighting.  Are you kidding me?  I know the fakes we're going to get from Bladder after.  Oh, yeah.  That one.  Yeah.  That doesn't work on the radio.  I think he knows there's a problem.  He's not a dumb guy.  I'll say that every time.  Bladder's not a dumb guy.  That's only one named mention. 
[00:43:30]  Even when people's backs are turned to the light, the shadow that it casts is distracting  to the person that's walking.  Because they're just seeing this giant shadow in front of them.  Oh, it's horrible.  How do we do suck a dick in Morse code?  You got it?  We have to do that?  Yeah, that's suck a dick.  Wow, that's a lot of...  Everyone knows S.  Dot, dot, dot.  Dot, dot, dot is what?  That's an S.  As in, like, S-O-S.  You have to do every letter individually? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, big pain in the S.  Dot, dot, dot.  Dot, dot, dash.  Dash, dot, dash, dot.  What's a dash?  All right, boys.  That's a longer thing.  Get on the light.  Boop.  We'll tell you what to do.  Boop.  This is going to be a highlight to certainly my career, that we're going to Morse code  suck a dick down the hole.  We should just have one light on.  Yeah, one light on.  It'll be a little complicated.  Okay, there it is.  Now listen to Anthony.  This is what you're going to do, Morse.  Okay.  Dot, dot, dot.  Good. 
[00:44:30]  Dot, dot, dash.  Dash, dot, dash, dot.  Dash.  Dot, dash.  Dot.  Well, the dash is when it's on longer.  Wait, is he doing it wrong?  No, he's doing like the dash.  He's just turning it and saying dash.  See, I have to start with it off.  Start with the light off.  He did the reverse.  Oh, he's doing the reverse.  And then go dot, dot, dot.  So quick, three quick ons. 
[00:45:00]  Okay, good.  Two quick ons, one long on.  Good.  There you go.  One long on.  That's a dash.  Dot, dash, dot.  Okay.  Got it.  Good.  Dash, dot, dash.  Dash.  Perfect.  Okay, that's suck.  All right, we got suck down.  We just Morse code suck down the hallway.  Good.  Dot, dash.  Dash, dot, dot. 
[00:45:30]  DJ Wonder just walked up the hallway while you were.  Dot, dot.  Morse coding suck.  Dash, dash, dash, dot.  Yep, he's got it.  And finally, dash, dot, dash, dash.  As soon as you finish, the guys from OutQ are going to run in.  There you have it.  For the first time on radio.  Morse code on the radio.  Morse code for suck a dick.  For suck a dick.  Yeah, hit him.  I think you did pretty good.  Hit him. 
[00:46:00]  Keep those lights on.  Or did you guys have your phone already?  Because, you know, people start showing up for work.  You know.  They have to work here, too.  You know.  We only penciled in five minutes of fun for everybody today.  I think you went over the limit.  I don't want it to be an HR problem.  Don't Morse code anything about penetration.  We can't even have that Morse code.  Can we have a secret Morse code now?  People were saying in the beginning when you were fucking it up was Mars code. 
[00:46:30]  Ah, because it was fucked up.  Some of that dirty Spanish.  Mars code.  You're a sucker ditch.  Yeah.  Great.  So there you go.  We have a solution today.  Lights that we can't use is today's solution.  Today's solution of the day.  Lights we can't use.  You can use them way down the hall.  I'm just seeing people walking out of their offices just to look down here and turn their  head quickly.  They have no idea why we're doing this. 
[00:47:00]  How many of those people do you think, when the fuck are they going to just get rid of  those idiots?  Morse.  Can they put them somewhere where we can't even see the studio even from a city block  away?  So I can focus on playing, you know, my music that is heard on every other radio station  in America.  Sam, is today a S for a raise day?  Do you pencil it in as an actual day?  I mean, I schedule.  What day is S for a raise day? 
[00:47:30]  I don't call it that.  I mean, I schedule meetings.  Sometimes I base it on what's gone on on the show.  For instance, I thought yesterday would be a bad day for a meeting.  Why?  Today is a worse day for a meeting.  Oh, because does this put them in a tizzy after we leave for the day?  Well, there's just no reason to go and...  I have heard, and I'm not going to say from who, that they take it out on you guys when  we beat the shit out of them.  I can't say that it's taken out on me.  I've heard a few times that they take it out on you because they can't take it out on us. 
[00:48:00]  So today you're not going to ask for a raise because you think they're in a kind of a bad  mood now.  Go in with the light and shine it right in their face.  Go, I want a raise.  Well, I mean...  I want to get my teeth cleaned with those lights.  Yeah, you could just put them on point in your teeth.  Yeah, get fucking Zell in here.  I got a book I'm in the middle of writing called Things Management Has Told Me Over  the Years.  Amazing things that management has told me over the years. 
[00:48:30]  Amazing things.  And Sam, I think you're going to make it.  Okay.  It's your fault that you don't have a raise because you're not asking often enough.  Yeah, yeah.  I might be paraphrasing, but...  You've got to get in there.  That could be the number one most amazing thing ever told to me or someone I know.  Get in there, Sam.  Come on.  Get in there.  Is today asked for a raise day?  I would hope all involved would realize that that was not my intention and that I never  said... 
[00:49:00]  I mean, again, that's Opie paraphrasing, not quoting my paraphrase.  I mean, I'm glad to be part of any book that Opie puts his name on, but who wouldn't?  Is it today or tomorrow?  I would go with tomorrow.  I think you might be right on this one.  I mean, I'll see what the vibe is like later this afternoon.  The vibe.  You think you woke up extra early today, meaning about...  Why is that sunglasses I'm walking down the hall?  Look at that.  You think this person woke up extra early today, around 6.15, turned on the radio show 
[00:49:30]  to go, I know today's the day.  They're going to be so happy with me and what I did for them.  All right.  Can we play act for just a couple of minutes on what he believed was going to happen?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, this is...  Oh, who has video?  Yeah.  One of the biggest assholes is walking down the hall right now, who glares at us every  day, and now he's got to deal with the light issue.  He's not going to be able to see us.  Do you have your camera? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I fucking didn't turn it on.  That's all right.  We'll look at him.  Because he's going to have a problem with this.  We're talking about Alex Bennett, who fucking hates us.  Yeah.  He passively, aggressively hates us.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Remember when we said that nobody was able to take the shortcut, so everybody has to  walk down the hall?  Yeah, everybody's forced to walk down the hall.  He's looking in, all perplexed.  He actually hates us.  He can't take his glasses off.  I think the reason why he did...  You know when you used to burn ants as a kid? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  He was scared his retinas were going to be burnt out.  Magnifying the rays.  All right.  What's the play acting?  I think we should do what they believed they would hear from this show as we saw the lights.  So if you will, we take us back to six or so when we start the show.  It's a shitty thing to do.  And what should we have said?  It should have been like, hey, good morning, everybody.  Opie and Anthony show.  And I got to tell you, it's going to kill me to say this. 
[00:51:00]  It's going to fucking kill me.  But for once in their stupid lives.  What?  This is the way I would do it.  Of course.  Of course.  They fucking did the right thing.  With what?  Now, you told me something about this before we went on the air, but I wanted it to be a surprise.  What do you mean with what?  Look up.  Look at these fucking lights they finally installed here after asking for it for eight to ten months.  I can't even believe they did this.  Finally.  Amazing.  They gave us these bright lights. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  And they're perfect.  They're exactly what we were asking for.  It's like a TV studio lighting, but it's not annoying.  It's just the room is lit really well.  It's lit really well.  It's nice and bright.  Better for pictures.  I can't even believe this because usually we ask for things and they don't get done.  Right.  Finally, today.  Mark this date, by the way, Sam.  Yes.  Mark this date is the day something finally and quickly got done perfectly, exactly the way we wanted it.  Well, we can't give him the quickly thing. 
[00:52:00]  Let's just throw it in because that's what he wanted to hear.  He has no sense of time.  It's like a dog that the owner left the house.  By the way, if it's gone for a week, a month, or a day, they all wagged and failed.  If you're turning in, we're play acting.  Yeah.  The complete opposite happened.  Yeah.  Yes.  Once again.  We asked for studio lighting and they gave us the sun.  I don't know how they did it, but they did, Jimmy.  They should have wheeled in two Klieg lights like a movie premiere.  Yeah.  Do you know people are actually coming from all over the city because they think there's  a sale or a grand opening happening here. 
[00:52:30]  These are actually the lights they use at Ground Zero every September 11th to aim up at the  clouds.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Well, back to the drawing board.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure we'll have a solution in another six to eight months.  Yeah.  All right.  We got another victim coming down the hall.  What's good is my bagel with a little ham and cheese isn't getting cold at all.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  The lights are keeping it warm.  It's like doing a radio show on a toaster oven. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, wow.  Isn't she lovely?  She can't see you wave.  She's looking right into the light.  Wow.  They can't see us, right?  They can't see us when we come down the hall.  Someone's going to complain.  My light's going to hurt.  Retinal damage.  I'm suing.  We keep them on until they tell us to turn them off because I want to see how that goes  down.  Guys, work has to get done.  What time do people start coming in over there?  Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven?  Seven, thirty, eight o'clock, I guess. 
[00:53:30]  I'm getting reports from other places in this building that their lights are a little dimmer  today.  Are we taking a little too much power?  It's like a convict buying it on the Green Mile.  Weren't we just having problems with the heat wave going on in New York?  Yes, they told us the concern of power.  Energy resources.  We got what amounts to back 2,000 LEDs lit up.  Unbelievable.  It's going back to the 90s later this week.  We could see how much energy we could possibly use.  Yeah, let's use more energy.  Keep the economy going. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  We should break because we've got a busy show today.  Real busy show.  Fuck, I want to do the NASCAR prayer.  You want to hear that before we go to break real fast?  What?  It's awesome.  We've got Doug Stanhope coming in at 8 o'clock and Andrew Dice Clay at 9, but we've  got the Comic-Con stuff that Jimmy and Sam did.  We really want to get into that after the break.  His dilated pupils might damage his eyes.  Stanhope when he walks down.  Oh, no kidding.  His drug-induced dilated pupils.  You've got a pastor who did the prayer for one of the NASCAR races. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know much about NASCAR, so I'm not going to try to make believe.  One of the races.  And I guess they do a prayer, and this guy decide, I'm going to do a prayer.  Really?  Oh, boy, did he do a prayer.  All right.  And this thing is viral, man.  People are loving this thing.  Check this out.  Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight for all your blessings.  You said in all things, give thanks.  So we want to thank you tonight for these mighty machines that you brought before us.  Thank you for the Dodges and the Toyotas.  Thank you for the Fords. 
[00:55:00]  And most of all, we thank you for Roush and Yates partnering to give us the power that we see before us tonight.  Thank you for GM Performance Technology and the R07 engines.  Thank you for Sunoco Racing Fuel and Goodyear tires that bring performance and power to the track.  Lord, I want to thank you for my smoking hot wife tonight, Lisa.  My two children, Eli and Emma, are as we like to call them, the little E's.  Lord, I may bless the drivers and use them tonight. 
[00:55:30]  May they put on a performance worthy of this great track.  In Jesus' name, boogity, boogity, boogity, amen.  Boogity, boogity, boogity.  Right on.  That's how you do a prayer.  If they had that shit going on, I'd be at church every Sunday.  That's craziness.  I'd be at church every Sunday.  I don't know if God brought Goodyear tires.  He does.  Oh, yeah, he does.  It all came from the earth.  Working on the tread.  Working on tread design or slick design.  Yeah, that's something. 
[00:56:00]  God hates the hydroplane.  Yeah, he's not a fan of that, right?  He hates that.  You fucking people in the South are a little crazy for us up here.  Our wacky Northerners.  I don't get that.  I think you might have came up with a new nickname today.  What was that word you said?  Bundle?  Bungle.  Bungle or Bungle?  Oh, Mr. Bungle.  Did you just make that up?  No, that's an old film thing that they used to show kids in school.  I thought it was Goofus and Gallant.  No, Goofus and Gallant was the Highlights magazine. 
[00:56:30]  Mr. Bungle.  No, but I know, but it sounds like the same bit.  It's pretty much the same bit.  Oh, okay.  There's The Good Kid and then Mr. Bungle.  But Mr. Bungle I saw on Pee-wee's Broadway show.  They showed a Mr. Bungle film clip.  Mr. Bungle knows to...  Yeah, that's the one in the upper right-hand corner.  That's The Good Kid.  Oh!  And it's like, he washes his hands before lunch.  Mr. Bungle doesn't wash his hands.  And Mr. Bungle's just this fucked up, very swarthy-looking kid. 
[00:57:00]  The white kid, the very pale kid with the blonde hair, is doing everything perfect.  And Mr. Bungle's like this dumb kid.  Oh, and that's who you associated with.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like he's ethnic in some way, shape, or form.  That's what's great.  Because it was the 50s.  It hurts even more when it comes from Anthony.  That makes me so happy.  Because it's like the easygoing one.  He's supposed to be the one that just kind of laughs.  He takes his little shots, but it's all in good fun.  And it always hurts more when Ant gets involved. 
[00:57:30]  I like jumping on board.  That gets me very excited.  I like jumping on board with things like this.  This is fantastic.  Because when Ant jumps on board, it means somebody really did something wrong.  The lights are also showing that our glass needs a cleaning.  It looks like someone came on our glass.  It does, absolutely.  What is that?  Jizz.  This is the company after they saw the deal they gave us.  No, I'm in a bad mood.  How long we got?  How long?  All this shit didn't put me in a bad mood. 
[00:58:00]  But what Jimmy just said, that's...  Oh, how long?  That's a good hour, brother.  Oh, shit.  Easy.  An hour?  Easy.  Damn.  That shit would drive me fucking nuts.  Is that jizz streams?  It does look like jizz.  But I'm sure it's just one of the numerous times somebody spits something out or thrown something  against the window.  And if I drew a trajectory line like forensics, I'm sure it would go right to your chair.  I didn't fucking throw anything lately. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you never know.  I don't throw.  Mr. Bung...  Here it is.  Turn it up.  Yeah, yeah.  Go back to the beginning of the Mr. Bungle.  Oh, I want to hear Mr. Bungle.  Do we start from the beginning?  Yeah, I guess Mr. Bungle.  Yeah, start from the beginning, Sam.  Well, actually, that's...  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  There it is.  Okay.  Brown said it was time for the children who ate in the cafeteria to go to lunch.  She hoped there weren't any Mr. Bungles in this room.  Phil almost walked past the boys' room, but he stopped and thought, were his hands clean? 
[00:59:00]  No, they were a little dirty.  He's stopping outside.  Oh, I can't fall.  Mr. Bungle.  Bill.  Mr. Bungle's hair was messy, too.  Phil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle.  His hair is like...  He's got a crew cut.  Young Bill Tetley going to the bathroom.  Inside the boys' room, Phil was surprised to see some of his friends washing their hands.  By the glory hole.  Phil washed his hands well with lots of soap.  Oh, my God.  He's just wasteful, Bill. 
[00:59:30]  He's just put some shit in your hands.  And he rinsed the soap off.  That's how you wash your hands, dummy.  Yeah, exactly.  These Aryan children.  He dried them in the hair of a Negro angrily.  And then he made sure that his hair looked neat.  He's not doing anything.  He's got a crew cut.  He's combing his nothing.  Now, Phil and his friends were ready for lunch.  Yeah.  Now you touched the dirty doorknob.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Four blonde gray kids. 
[01:00:00]  They stomped a Jew on the way down the hallway.  And they kicked him in his acidic face.  There was a line of children waiting to get into the lunchroom when Phil got there.  Yeah.  He saw some boys he knew at the front of the line.  Uh-oh.  They waved for him to go up to the front with them.  But Phil didn't want to break into line as Mr. Bungle did.  So Phil went to the end.  That was the fair thing to do.  That was the fair thing.  He put his knife, fork, and spoon neatly on the tray.  We all want to be Mr. Bungle.  Yes. 
[01:00:30]  And then he slid his tray along.  Bill tried to cut the line and got shanked like in prison.  He always enjoyed looking at the good food in the cafeteria.  It tasted good and was good for him, too.  Love propaganda.  Instead of having a sandwich today, Phil decided to take the hot lunch.  Ugh.  A slice of meat.  Phil took some bread and butter, too.  And he knew what else he wanted.  A heart attack when he was 40.  But Alice took the last carton on the tray. 
[01:01:00]  Maybe there was more milk.  So he said, may I please have some milk?  Phil remembered to say, may I, and please.  That was very polite.  Yes, there was more milk.  The Negro brought it out to him.  Yes.  Phil remembered to say, thank you, when he took the carton of milk.  And presented his free lunch card because his father's an alcoholic.  He didn't want to be right at Mr. Bungle in the lunchroom.  Phil didn't want to forget his dessert. 
[01:01:30]  The cake looked delicious.  The cake's giant.  At the end of the line, the lunchroom supervisor said she had noticed how polite Phil was.  Yes.  And she smiled at him.  Yeah.  And how Mr. Erock took five slices of cake and left the meatloaf.  Phil went to the table where his friends were.  He put his tray down carefully.  There's a smile going to get you in this world.  Yeah.  Quietly.  And sat down.  He knew his friends wouldn't like a noisy Mr. Bungle at their table.  That's right.  There was someone Phil liked. 
[01:02:00]  Freddie.  Freddie don't draw.  Yes.  Freddie looks constipated.  Freddie got his feet on the floor, too.  Yes.  Freddie.  Freddie is punched in the chest by his father when he makes noise.  Like coughing at the table.  Another polite person everyone liked was Alice.  Another little blonde.  Alice is going bald at seven.  She covered her mouth and nose.  This protected her friends at the table from any germs.  Another blonde kid.  While Phil and his friends ate, a boy ran past their table. 
[01:02:30]  Look, see?  Look at the evil kid.  You shouldn't drown in the lunchroom.  Only Mr. Bungle would do that.  Yeah, he's got dark hair.  He looks all fucking...  His friend was choking.  He was going to get help.  His friend died because he walked.  Then lunchtime wouldn't be as much fun as it is.  Oh, brother.  Well, Pee Wee goes,  Is that a big piece of cake or what?  Really?  Yeah.  He comes right back and goes,  Is that a big piece of cake or what?  That's horrible. 
[01:03:00]  Mr. Bungle.  That taught the kids back then.  That was like a fucking film you'd watch in school.  And the only thing worse than Mr. Bungle is Mr. Jungle.  As in Bunny.  We don't want him at our table, do we?  You didn't see one African-American child.  There wasn't one Italian in the room.  Nothing.  No diversity whatsoever.  No.  Just white kids.  It's Mr. Bungle on YouTube.  Everybody wants to check this out.  Mr. Bungle.  The children of Hitler and Goebbels  eat big pieces of cake and meatloaf. 
[01:03:30]  Now, the sun is coming up down the hall,  and I think our light's just as bright.  Look.  Yeah, yeah.  You can still see.  Actually, our light's still brighter  than the actual sun coming up.  It's brighter than the sun.  We're going to break.  Jimmy's back,  and I heard you guys got some great stuff from Comic-Con.  We had a, yes, we had a good time.  So I want to hear all about it.  Enjoyed it.  I'm going to sit up straight.  Yes.  Quietly eat my sandwich.  Eat your sandwich.  Don't be a Mr. Bungle and make noise.  Mr. Bungle got the wrong lights. 
[01:04:00]  I have to go to the restroom.  I don't want to be a Mr. Bungle  and peek at the genitals of the boy next to me.  I'm a good boy, and I look straight ahead.  Jimmy's a Mr. Bungle.  Only a Mr. Bungle is curious about the genital size of his friends and coworkers.  Only a Mr. Bungle goes, pssst, while urinating.  Jimmy Bungle put his foot underneath the stall and tapped it lightly,  trying to get the attention of the man next to him.  A Mr. Bungle keeps the urinal nice and clean.  He doesn't bring a drill from outside  and make a hole for other boys to put their genitals through. 
[01:04:30]  Mr. Bungle would...  Wait, Mr. Bungle does do that.  Jimmy doesn't.  Freudian slip.  I said Mr. Bungle doesn't fucking...  No, Jimmy does.  Yes.  I'm tired.  Do you think...  All right.  It'll start a whole other question.  Are you going to eat?  All right, yeah.  We'll be back.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide,  Police Commissioner Vic Dumb grills our young hero 
[01:05:00]  about his mishandling of the Angerman incident.  Meanwhile, a deadly new temptress lurks in the shadows.  Goddamn suicide.  How many times have I told you?  I know, but...  The children.  That's enough.  You screwed up the entire operation  and Angerman managed to escape.  He escaped?  I'm un...  How'd that happen?  I'm unstoppable. 
[01:05:30]  Never mind that.  It's our case now.  Stay the hell out of the way.  But, but, but...  That's enough.  Stay here.  I'm not finished with you.  I have to go take a shit.  The city needs me.  I'll...  I'll show them I can stop crime.  Hey there, suicide.  Oh no, Jenny, tell ya.  How the hell did you get in here?  My beauty was too much for this police department to handle.  Now, they're all stuck in my sexy trance. 
[01:06:00]  No, you didn't!  Oh, yes I did.  And now, I have you all to myself.  Now, suicide.  Stop it!  Why, suicide?  Aren't you getting turned on?  No!  I can't let this happen!  Stop it!  Get away from me!  That's right, suicide.  Stare through my horn-rimmed glasses and into my eyes.  Oh God!  Hands!  Getting too tight! 
[01:06:30]  That's right.  No!  No!  Yes!  Come on, suicide.  Oh my God!  I'm coming!  Oh, my sweet suicide.  Now, with you out of the way, this city will finally be under my control.  Mwah!  What the...  What the hell happened here?  Suicide!  Wake up!  Wake up!  It...  It...  No, this can't be happening.  It was Jenny Tilia! 
[01:07:00]  She's gonna pay for this!  Stay tuned for an all-new adventure of The Spectacular Suicide!  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the OPN Entity Show.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a man of wealth and taste.  I've been around for a long long year.  Oh, that's a great song.  Good birthday.  67 for Mick Jagger. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  It's been a good 67 years.  Fuck, man.  It's been an amazing 67 years.  Wow.  I'm hooked up.  Fager's Banquet, 42 years ago today, was released.  Mm-hmm.  And Babe Ruth, seen in public for the last time 63 years ago today.  Wow.  Can I have a cigarette?  So that means Mick Jagger was four years old when Babe Ruth said goodbye to the world, basically.  Wow.  Yep.  And that's this day in history. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, no.  Helen Mirren, the big 6'5".  Yeah.  Not a fan, huh?  Yeah.  Not really.  She's good.  Oh, look at that.  And Kevin Spacey is 52.  Sandra Bullock's 47.  Jeremy Piven, 46.  And Kate Beckinsale would be 38 years old.  I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale.  Like Kate Beckinsale.  I think we're off by a year on every one.  Mick Jagger, we have...  How old is Mick Jagger?  67.  It said 68 on the news.  It also said Jeremy Piven was 46 and Sandra Bullock was 47. 
[01:08:30]  Is this a fucking year old?  How old is Mick Jagger?  He was born in 1943.  That would make him 68.  Make him 68.  And how old is Helen Mirren?  We can't get anything right.  This is probably the same fucking prep sheet from a year ago.  We can't get anything right.  That's fucking fantastic.  Helen Mirren was born in 1945.  That would make her 66. 
[01:09:00]  So...  What happened?  What happened there?  We fucked up our birthday dates.  No, this is exactly...  It's our show.  It's a fucking...  That's what's happening.  It is a...  This is it.  What year did Beggar's Banquet come out?  I want to see if somebody just copied and pasted this from a year ago.  Oh, no.  How do you do that with birthdays?  How do you fuck up birthdays?  We used to be amazing radio guys.  Released December 1968. 
[01:09:30]  That's 43 years ago.  That's 43 years ago.  So, we're off by a year on everything.  Who did this?  Okay, come on.  Although the Apollo 15 launch...  Launched?  Apollo 15?  Launched 40 years ago?  Is that possible, man?  40 years?  Let's see.  It was launched in...  All right.  The mission began July 26th, 1971.  That's 40 years ago.  40 years ago.  So, hey.  We got one right.  Got one.  No, we didn't.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:10:00]  We got one right.  But wait a minute.  There's something wrong here.  What was Babe Ruth's last public appearance?  I guarantee it was 64 years ago.  I'm going to guess April of this year.  Oh, I thought it was farther away.  Oh, I didn't know if it was recent.  Oh, I didn't know if it was recent.  48?  1948?  1948.  That's...  52?  That's 63 years ago.  I'm really good at math. 
[01:10:30]  Don't even fucking question it.  48?  You keep doing your math, and you're going to get the same answer I just got.  So some of these are right, some of these are wrong.  That's even more disturbing.  Bambino.  The Bambino.  So basically, whatever dummy did this, did it last year, and was just wrong last year,  and he got lucky in his right this year.  Copy, paste.  Yeah.  There's some copy and pasting going on right now.  Copy and paste like it's a computer.  Timothy Hughes.  That's my uncle.  What does he got? 
[01:11:00]  It's rare in early newspapers.  Yeah, that's him.  All right.  He's really into that shit.  Hey, what do you want to do?  Comic-Con.  Comic-Con.  Or is it called Comic-Con?  Comic-Con, I think.  I like shortening it to Comic-Con.  It's a comic convention.  What was going on out there?  We really missed Jim and Sam.  How was the trip?  Phenomenal.  It was great.  My first two days.  How was the flight?  How was the food?  How was the accommodations?  How was the hookers that Jimmy got you, Sam? 
[01:11:30]  Jim didn't get me any hookers, but my mom called me once while I was in the hotel  and asked if Jim had gotten me any hookers.  Oh, I informed her that she had not.  She doesn't know Jim.  No, Jim would spend his money on his own hookers.  Yeah.  Miss Roberts, I don't...  That's her name, right?  Yes.  I don't spend...  I don't buy my friends hookers.  No.  I buy myself hookers.  Yes.  And I tell my friends about them.  Yes.  I thought it was a good trip, though.  The airfare, everything was fine on the flight.  And there was one moment when Jim and I walked the beach trying to get to the boardwalk 
[01:12:00]  together.  Oh, that sounds sweet.  We did do that.  And we acknowledged the latent homosexual tendencies of doing so.  Well, gay?  Yeah, well, it wasn't as gay as when the next night when we went to dinner and Jim asked  the waitress to take a photo of us because it was our anniversary.  I had called up and made reservations.  I'm like, can we have a booth?  Because it's like a special night for us.  And I would do it under his name.  And then she gave us the booth and it was just, look, it's our anniversary.  And I called him she the whole time and nobody fucking said anything. 
[01:12:30]  It was California.  Oh, man.  Nobody said anything.  I was like, no, no, no, no.  She doesn't eat seafood.  They're like, oh, okay, okay.  Nobody said a word.  Sheet.  Because Sam looks like a man, but you never know.  He's kind of androgynous.  Be twinkish.  You are androgy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are that.  He could be this fucking weird, ugly chick.  I mean, I guess it's possible.  Some facial hair problems.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, if he's clean shaven, absolutely.  And I was.  Yeah, okay.  At the time. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, San Diego is nice as they say.  I want to hear about faraway lines.  Well, I mean, it's.  They say it's beautiful and the weather's perfect.  The weather is perfect.  The beach is nice.  Breezy, 80 degrees.  Lots of surfers walking around.  Surfers.  Hey, dude.  Yeah.  Lots of good looking people.  Well, he stayed at separate hotels just because the different companies made, but both accommodations  were fine.  Yours was better, though, right?  Yeah, probably.  But it doesn't matter.  Sam's still at a good place.  He stayed at Marriott, Mario. 
[01:13:30]  It was.  He stayed at a good place.  Were they close enough to the Comic-Con?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think Sam was closer than I was.  Nice.  Yeah.  And we both had a rental car and we had parking and it was much.  Everything was smooth this year.  Yeah.  We learned from our mistakes from last year.  Oh.  And Jimmy got arrested.  Yes.  Jimmy got arrested.  It's funny, that was, Sam actually came along with the tonight, because the first two days  I had to do mostly Leno shooting and so Sam just kind of came with us.  He met us at the hotel, because I didn't want to be by himself.  Oh.  So he would eat with us and hang with us and just, you know, when we got there, he would 
[01:14:00]  run off and do some audio and stuff and I would do the other stuff.  And, yeah, on one of the days I was doing, the Leno bit ended with what it ended with,  but it was possibly going to be with me getting arrested for pirating and selling Spider-Man.  It was like the whole, we tried a couple different concepts.  We interviewed Stan Lee.  We didn't want to be using it.  And one of the things was he gets me arrested for stealing Spider-Man.  And Vanity Fair wrote about it, because the guy happened to walk in as it was happening. 
[01:14:30]  Yes, yes.  I saw that.  Yeah.  But one of those guys is actually Izzy.  One of the guys in the security jacket is throwing me out is actually Izzy from The  Tonight Show.  He's the coordinator.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because they couldn't get real cops.  So we asked real cops and they wouldn't do it.  They're not allowed to.  They had to go through the chief.  So then we asked the security running the thing.  Could they do it for the shot?  But they had to get in touch with the owner of their company because they didn't want to  get in trouble for shooting it without permission.  And they couldn't.  They just couldn't get a hold of the guy. 
[01:15:00]  So we just did it.  But a lot of people did think I was really getting arrested.  Yeah.  I got so many tweets about it.  I know.  The tweets were going crazy.  And I had to do this.  What happened to Jimmy?  Happened.  Yeah.  Then I didn't get arrested.  No.  Of course not.  I'm a very well behaved boy.  Yes.  You were a good boy.  I was.  Not a naughty boy.  Not a naughty boy.  All right.  Well, Comic-Con.  Yeah.  And I don't know what audio Sam has, to be honest with you.  Sam picked some good stuff here.  We're also doing, on Thursday morning at 10 a.m., we're going to do a Comic-Con special. 
[01:15:30]  Nice.  So I saved most of the, like, because we actually got celebrity interviews this time.  Not round tables.  Good stuff.  Yeah.  Nice one with Joel McHale.  It was very, very cool.  Talked to him for about 10, 15 minutes.  And then Ken Jian came over just to say hello and was chatting.  Nice.  And I saw Chevy Chase after to get my photo.  Oh.  Oh.  How did that work out?  It was great.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  I had to finagle that one because we were sitting there.  We were done with the interview and we knew the publicist probably wanted us to leave.  So Sam was, like, wrapping up his cord and I'm like, just wrap real slowly.  And we were waiting for Chevy to finish with this CNN interview.  Like, it literally would have taken me 10 minutes or more to pack my equipment up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, that's how slowly I had to move.  Yeah.  We were just trying to talk like we still belong there.  So when Chevy finished, we sat behind Book of Mormon.  So that's what I'll talk to him about.  So when he walks by, I'm like, hey, Chevy. 
[01:16:30]  And he goes, hey.  He didn't want to stop.  He was just going to go.  Of course he didn't.  Well, he had done his interview, but they had a panel to do.  So I think he actually had to go and do a panel in front of 1,500 people.  He wasn't, I think he just had to do that.  But I stopped.  I'm like, oh, Josh Gad was talking.  He's like, cool.  I'm like, from Book of Mormon.  I'm like, we interviewed him.  And he said how great it was that you were there.  He was, oh, yeah.  And that got him to stop and chat for a minute.  Ah, look at you.  And he's like, yeah, I went back.  I'm like, yeah.  Because Josh Gad did say that.  He said how great it was.  Yeah, he did.  And then he's like, oh, that's great. 
[01:17:00]  And I'm like, can I picture?  And he's like, oh, OK.  He went off, OK.  Because what happened was, Jim had, this was not like a spontaneous conversation.  Jim is sitting there whispering, because Chevy Chase is at the next table.  And he goes, all right, so once he gets up, I'm just going to stand up.  And I'm going to say, hey, Josh Gad was in the studio.  Oh, I know.  We all know it's all planned out.  But Chevy Chase realized it was all planned out, too.  Because he didn't want to stop.  He was kind of like brushing him off.  He said, who? 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  And he was almost keeping walking.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Jim brought up Book of Mormons, and Chevy was like, oh, yeah, and didn't mind  talking about it for a little bit.  And then after a minute and a half of chatting, when Jim said, can I have a picture, Chevy's  face just completely dropped.  He went like, oh, he got me.  He realized he got me.  That fucker got me.  He had wormed it in.  He had wormed his way in, Jimmy.  That's what Sam said to me after.  He goes, he thought he was having a real conversation.  And then he realized you were just a worm.  Just a worm.  I thought it was going to get a picture. 
[01:18:00]  What do you think the W on my shirt's for?  He thought it was a professional exchange.  Like, oh, this is a guy in broadcasting, blah, blah, blah.  We're just checking.  Yes.  And then he's, no, it's just another fanboy trying to get a picture.  That's really funny.  Yeah, it was good.  But you got your picture.  But if I would have just said to him, can I have a picture?  He might have stopped anyway, but I didn't start that way.  I bet he wouldn't have.  You know what?  Chevy's notoriously known to be, he's a prick.  Yeah, I've heard he's a rough one.  And sufferable.  But, you know, he knew we were interviewing two guys he knew, so maybe that would have helped.  You missed yesterday the unbelievable actor Don Cheadle right here in our studio. 
[01:18:30]  You had fucking Don Cheadle in here?  Yes, we did.  You want to play it back?  Why didn't I know he was coming in?  I would have fucking...  I know, right?  One second.  Did you guys know he was coming in?  Well, it was the last minute book.  Last minute.  I would have had my thing signed.  Fuck!  What thing?  My copy of Boogie Nights.  Oh, wow.  Fucking yeah, Boogie Nights.  God fucking damn it.  I keep forgetting what great movies he's in.  And also Crash.  He's in two of my favorite movies.  Crash.  Crash was a good movie. 
[01:19:00]  Play the Cheadle...  God damn it!  Who was in at the time when it all went down?  We had Mark Maron and Joe DeRosa.  And DeRosa.  Fucking Don Cheadle.  Here it is.  Why are you spitting?  He's so mad now.  Fuck.  Maybe we shouldn't have brought it up.  No, I'm just annoyed.  I mean, it's one of those things where I just wasn't here.  All right.  Here it is.  It's quick.  It's Don Cheadle.  Don A!  Don Cheadle.  Don A!  He's a good actor.  He was on a plane with me yesterday.  Was he?  Yeah, in first.  I was in coach.  Oh, come on. 
[01:19:30]  Don A!  Don Cheadle!  You don't...  Can they hear us, don't they?  I'm hoping.  He's not going.  He's not going.  Why would he come on our show?  It's perfect.  Yeah, I did.  Why not?  Cheadle!  Because it's not perfect.  What's up?  Hey!  He's a good actor, that guy.  Nothing.  Good actor.  He is.  You talk to him?  He's like, I'm going in here, man.  He's doing Sway Show.  Yeah, he's booked up.  How are you doing, Don Cheadle?  I was on the plane with you yesterday.  How are you doing, man?  Don, we just want to say hi. 
[01:20:00]  That's all.  I know you're busy.  Big fan, man.  We can't take you away from another show.  That's not fair around here, bud.  Yeah, look.  Look.  Get him here.  Get him here.  Say, look.  All right.  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle.  I mean, that was it.  We could officially say it.  That was our interview with Don Cheadle.  Hi, how are you doing?  Did we know he was going to be in the building or no?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Do I have the prep sheet?  At all.  He would have.  Was he on the list?  I think he was.  I think an email got sent out on Friday.  He would have had a great time on our show, too.  It's too bad.  I loved having Don Cheadle.  I'm a huge fan of that motherfucker.  Of course.  He's really good.  We had him on, though. 
[01:20:30]  But he wouldn't have done this show.  You heard his voice, right?  In the background.  So, officially, Roland could tell all the publicists we've had Don Cheadle on.  For a second.  Yeah, that's how that shit works.  He wasn't even on mic.  He was just like, hey, how you doing?  And then they dragged him out of here so quickly.  It's official.  Oh, boy.  He was on our show.  Yeah.  It is official.  I love when we see these comics that we've never heard of, and they'll say in their bios,  you know, part of the Opie and Anthony show, a regular on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we could use that.  And I'm like, who the fuck are you? 
[01:21:00]  And then if you dig a little deeper, you find out that maybe this person got through on the  phones and asked a question.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, they're using it in their bio to sell tickets for a comedy show.  Yeah.  So, now we do the same thing with Don Cheadle.  Yeah, Don Cheadle.  We've had the likes of Don Cheadle.  Oh, this is Jimmy Off.  You all right?  Oh.  You all right, Jimmy?  No, I'd just like to get a list.  He'll come back.  Of who's coming in.  Of who's coming in.  And I asked, maybe Travis did send it, so I'm not saying he didn't.  Yeah.  But I'm going to be fucking annoyed if I didn't get that.  I'd like to have it to this hour until I know. 
[01:21:30]  People ask about my moods.  Travis said he didn't send it.  How long will you be annoyed?  Oh, okay.  And we wouldn't have gotten it until, we didn't get it until we were in San Diego.  Yeah, but I could have had Kenny pick something up.  How long will you be annoyed, though, now?  It depends if I don't see this list.  Is he on the list or no?  Yeah.  Let me see.  He's on Monday.  Oh, boy.  There it is right there.  I didn't.  So, 725, Monday.  Who else is in?  It was yesterday.  Melissa Joan Hart. 
[01:22:00]  How come I heard that one and she's not doing it?  Yeah, I don't.  I'm a big fan of Clarissa.  Are you?  She wouldn't do the after show.  I know.  I was listening to the after show on my drive home.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I wasn't listening.  But why wouldn't she do it?  I don't know.  Why couldn't we get him?  Don Cheadle, what did he just do, one show?  He just did Sway, that's it.  Yeah, it's a black thing.  I don't know if it's a black thing.  Well, the only show he does is the black show?  Maybe he knows Sway from MTV.  The only show he does is the black show.  That black show.  I'm just saying that seems to me a little bit of a black thing. 
[01:22:30]  I'm not saying it's racist.  I'm just saying it's a black thing.  It's a black thing.  It's a thing between the brothers, but that guy on Al Q.  What?  He's black.  Yeah, but he's, that's Al Q.  He's got the other thing.  He didn't send it to him.  Oh, less black.  He said he didn't because.  Oh, shit.  So there's going to be an annoyance now.  I don't see it.  Maybe he did, I just didn't see it.  He said I just sent it again.  It was sent, I'll give you a date. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, boy.  Don Cheadle.  We got Comic-Con stuff to do.  20.  Can you see if I'm on the list that it was sent out?  It's BCC.  Oh, boy.  BCC.  What does BCC mean?  Blind.  Oh, blind.  Friday.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  That was invented by a corporate guy.  Trust me.  That's a blind CC.  No accountability.  Everybody on it, but we don't know who they are.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't matter.  That's brilliant.  It just comes up as ha-ha-hardy-har when you click on it. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Oh.  All right, Comic-Con.  Let's get a few of these clips in before Mr. Stanhope arrives.  Doug.  So, that's the setup.  You guys had a good time.  Well, yeah.  A lot of people there.  A lot of interviews.  There's going to be a special Thursday at 10 a.m.  Yes.  On this channel.  Okay.  Where you're interviewing some big guys like Joel McHale.  We had Joel McHale.  The Mythbusters.  We had everybody from Wilfred. 
[01:24:00]  Pendulette.  Although Pendulette is like a half hour, so I don't know.  We might air that separately.  Wow.  Well, that's good for your show.  Are we doing a Comic-Con special, just that one?  Maybe we should play the Pendulette today at 9.30 just to give people a taste of...  Oh, that would probably be a good thing.  I mean, why waste the audio?  I mean, it's original content.  It certainly is.  Yeah.  I mean, if you want to, that can be arranged.  It's not a bad idea, Sam.  I'm glad we thought of it.  Okay.  But yeah, and then, you know, stuff on the floor and everything. 
[01:24:30]  But it was much better this year.  All the travel was great.  Getting there was easy.  Interviews were fantastic.  First class, right?  They flew you first class?  I didn't fly first class.  What?  No.  I mean, but coach was fine.  Really?  Yeah.  Emergency aisle?  No, that's...  I mean, I didn't want to splurge.  Please tell me you were in the middle of a row.  No, no.  I mean, I chose my own seat, so I...  Are you a window guy or an aisle guy? 
[01:25:00]  Me, I'm an aisle guy.  I'm a window guy.  I'm a window guy.  I love the window.  I don't want to be moving my knees for nobody.  Every so often, I like lifting up the little window thing, looking out.  Yeah, we're still flying.  I like the idea of being able to move about the cabin without having to...  That means you've got to move your knees a lot.  Yeah, then some asshole getting out and putting his ass in your face.  Yeah.  He'll excuse me.  Oh, fuck.  He's got swamp ass.  It's terrible.  Yeah, he's got traveler's ass.  He's a businessman from Idaho.  He's been sitting on planes all day.  Right. 
[01:25:30]  And airports.  Yeah.  With the sweat just dripping down his ass crack.  Now, he's got his ass in your face because he has to go to the bathroom.  Oh.  Mr. Bungle puts his ass in your face on an airplane.  Well, on the way back, there was nobody in the middle seat, so I could stretch my legs  out diagonally.  Oh.  Well, that's great.  That isn't too uncomfortable when you're diagonal and the armrest is digging into your  hip.  That's great.  It's just like first class, by the way.  It was a good flight.  It was a great hotel.  Yeah.  Rental car was great. 
[01:26:00]  Nice big meal on the plane.  I had some cinnamon buns.  In an old bag.  For a six-hour flight.  I could never fly coach again.  I mean, it wasn't.  You could get a meal in coach still, right?  I guess.  I haven't flown in quite a while now.  Can you get a meal in coach?  For like a six-hour flight, you can get like a chicken wrap, but I don't know if I trust  a chicken wrap on an airplane.  Why?  Why?  It just sits there.  They make that shit fresh.  Oh, that truck pulls up, loads all the goodness in.  That's right. 
[01:26:30]  And then you load that goodness into you.  More everything!  That's good with the cinnamon buns, I guess.  Yeah?  Yeah, but Jim and me ate very well there.  I'm sure.  You know, Jim goes to the finest establishments.  Yeah.  And yeah, we had a blast.  Well, let's play a few clips.  Sure.  Sam, talk to Elijah Wood.  Well, I wanted to give you guys a taste of some of the celebrities we talked to.  Just a taste.  What's today's date?  Well, and to the Puppet Master.  Today's date is 26th.  Did you ask him about Yo Gabba Gabba?  No. 
[01:27:00]  He was a big star.  I only had a few minutes with him, but I made sure.  Before the interview, Jim was wondering if he would remember who he was.  Because he was just on the show recently.  Of course he was.  Very recently.  So that's what I asked.  Two weeks ago, I think.  Maybe three.  Yeah, a few weeks ago.  All right.  Here's Sam talking to Elijah Wood.  You did the Opie and Anthony show on SiriusXM.  Yep.  Not too long ago.  Do you have any idea who Jim Norton is?  Because he's hoping you do, but I seriously doubt that you do.  If you don't, don't lie.  I don't know Jim Norton.  Yes. 
[01:27:30]  He's the host of the show.  He's the comedian who's on the show, and he sat right next to you.  Oh, the guy right next to me.  Okay.  Yes.  No, you don't know.  I do, I do, I do.  Just not by name.  He was the one.  I don't know by name.  I'm sorry, Jim.  I'm so sorry.  I was doing a lot of interviews.  No, I know.  I did.  I don't sometimes remember people's names.  Trust me, no.  A lot of people.  No is the right answer in this.  But that's unfair.  I see that you were wanting a no.  No is the right answer.  He didn't remember.  And while G4 was interviewing Elijah Wood, I got my dumb face in the back of their shot. 
[01:28:00]  I saw it.  I saw it.  You were right there.  Covering cover for G4.  You really were getting into some shots of video.  And for those that watch The Tonight Show.  Uh-huh.  Yep.  That was me on The Tonight Show last night.  You weaseled your way into that, too.  Just be honest.  That's right.  You weaseled your way in.  I'm distracted, because is that the picture of our new studio light?  That's from inside the office.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  When you first heard it.  You're kidding.  No, when you first turned it on.  Go to Jim Norton's Twitter. 
[01:28:30]  It's like an eclipse.  You're kidding.  Am I holding the light somewhere in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't even see it.  There's a picture of me holding the brand new light that we bitched about for the first  hour of the show.  Fantastic.  So once again, management fucked up.  And Norton got a great picture of me holding the light up for the first time.  Yep.  Seriously.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Elijah's good.  He's a solid dude.  He's a great guy.  Seems like a regular guy.  Yeah, he's a really good down-to-earth guy.  That's been extremely successful in his career.  Yeah, he was happy to do interviews and everything. 
[01:29:00]  Mr. Froto.  Froto.  Now we move on to...  Well, yeah, we had the Mythbusters, Kerry Byron and two other guys.  Oh, Kerry Byron.  That's right.  And when Jim and I...  What do you mean by two other guys?  Was it the main guys?  Oh, okay.  That's why it was two other guys.  I wasn't sure.  No, no, I know.  It wasn't the beret guy.  The beret guy.  Oh, how could you...  How could you not watch Mythbusters?  I don't watch.  But when we got to the hotel, the suite or whatever that they were doing interviews in, 
[01:29:30]  Kerry Byron told Jim that Danny had been tweeting her.  Oh, yes, yes.  Indeed.  Yeah.  So Jim asked her about that.  I would...  Yeah.  Now, Danny, obviously, on our show.  Now, what has Danny been pestering you to do?  Besides the obvious.  Oh, I think he actually has been on the Twitter trying to get people to get an autograph of  some artwork from one of the booths, but I haven't been able to make... 
[01:30:00]  Has he asked you?  Yes.  But he actually would like to come visit the set.  I've invited him.  I said we'd give him a tour.  Yeah, that's...  What a horrible mistake that is.  You know that, right?  You know, I gave you a tour, so I figured, you know, we have to invite him.  But you know that I'm a nice guy.  I'm not creepy.  Danny's got, like, a creepy love for you, and he'll just lurk around and he'll quote  every episode.  He'll really bug you.  Me and Kenny came by after we went to San Quentin.  Yeah, but you showed up in sweatpants.  How creepy is that?  Fair point.  You know what?  We had a strip club or something?  Well, almost. 
[01:30:30]  I mean, we took a tour of San Quentin.  One of the guards is a fan.  And they said you can't wear jeans.  So, I guess because it resembles too much what the convicts wear, so we have to wear  sweatpants.  So, I wore sweatpants, and I didn't realize that that would be really creepy to show up  in a pair of sweats.  So, my apologies.  Well, you know, hopefully Danny will show up in, like, a three-piece suit and offset  all the creepiness that you brought.  And stop asking her to do stuff for you, stupid.  She's busy.  That's good. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, he's very psyched to go out there and...  Fuck yeah, man.  That would be cool.  See the crew.  All right.  Well, yeah, and like I said, we wanted to...  Because the other interviews are more like, just listen to the interview.  So, we're going to play them in the special.  Oh, I know.  You're just giving the people a taste here.  I get it.  Just a little something.  I think they get it.  Yes.  The big special will be Thursday at 10 o'clock.  Right.  Okay.  But this is just a little...  So, then Jim and me...  A little appetizer.  On Saturday spent most of our day on the floor of Comic-Con. 
[01:31:30]  And while we were getting coffee, we met this insane girl named Cass.  Who was just...  She started talking to us really loudly about how much she loved Dimitri Martin.  I was getting a coffee and her volume...  She's one of those people who in natural conversation just kind of talks like that.  And I'm so glad that I'm not sitting next to her on a plane because she'd probably talk  that loud.  Wow.  That was annoying.  And everybody was turning around and looking and she had this giant sign that said she 
[01:32:00]  was looking to meet Dimitri Martin and it had an email address on it and all this stuff.  And so, Jim and I decided to take a recorder and follow her around the floor for a while.  And this is a taste of who she is.  We had her go into the middle of the convention center and just start screaming about Dimitri  Martin before security got involved.  I got involved.  They did.  Yeah.  Hi.  Where are you from?  I'm from San Diego. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, you are.  I think I had to see that before.  Maybe.  I don't remember.  Yeah, you look different now.  What are you holding?  Oh, I put it on a lanyard.  I got a little fancy with it.  I was like, hey, yo.  I need my hands free.  For what?  So that people can, you know, they'll be like, hey, what's up?  You want to high five or, you know, check the sign out, check the front, right?  And then they're like, and then I'm like, yo, you know Dimitri?  Like, tell him I'm looking for him.  Geek for Dimitri.  Anybody can email me, though.  Like, it's not a big deal. 
[01:33:00]  We got to cross our fingers.  I want to make some money to see Dimitri Martin.  Does anyone know who Dimitri Martin is?  He's really funny.  Do you want to help me get there?  Do you have like 25 cents, a penny?  Penny goes a long way.  You can ask for money.  Oh, okay.  That's not my rule in Comic-Con.  The security.  You can ask for anything.  You ask for quarters and dollars.  I'll stand here.  There's always somebody right nearby to fuck things up.  Yeah, security. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, she just started screaming.  Like, that mic, that's just the mic on a video camera.  That's not like it.  Yeah, it's not.  That's not by her face.  No, at all.  Wow.  She's loud.  Were people turning around?  Yeah.  They're gathering.  We're gathering.  A scene.  Did you get that YouTube page or no?  I don't know.  A similar one.  Okay.  I got a similar one.  We'll talk about it.  Okay.  But, yeah.  And then we told her what show that we were with.  And so she figured that she would send a shout out to Opie and Anthony for some help getting 
[01:34:00]  Dimitri Martin tickets.  Oh, yeah.  And we figured that her yelling Opie and Anthony at Comic-Con is great press for the show.  It's terrific.  It's perfect.  Perfect.  Very smart on your parts.  Yeah.  Just what we want.  Yes.  Yeah.  So we play this?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, you know Dimitri, so I want to talk to you, so I can't get to him.  And you know what really sucks?  Who?  E-Rock.  That big fat pig.  He's like, what, what?  He's eating donuts all the time. 
[01:34:30]  God.  It is a gentleman.  E-Rock sucks.  He's a big fat pig.  But if you got donuts, if you got donuts, he's your best friend.  Oh, my God.  I can't even look over there.  Oh, man.  Who's looking over there?  I can't see.  He's out of camera range.  I don't know why she said those things.  Why would she say that? 
[01:35:00]  I guess she knows the show.  Oh, no.  It's so weird that she knows the show.  It doesn't seem like she's the type of person that would listen to our show.  We're big on the West Coast.  I see.  We're really big in San Diego.  Really big.  Oh, my God.  So wrong.  He's nuts, though.  Does E-Rock want to comment?  E-Rock, some bitch in San Diego was making fun of you.  Yeah, I heard.  That's probably all the E-Rock stuff, though, right?  Well, I don't have the other stuff.  I could run and grab it. 
[01:35:30]  He just turned his mic off.  All right.  Comment.  You don't have the other stuff?  What happened?  I mean, I could burn another track real quick.  I like seeing what E-Rock's doing.  That's cool.  I could just look at that screen.  I think he's making paper dolls.  What is it?  Oh, no.  He's making templates.  What's that?  That Chinese thing?  Origami?  I was going to say edamame.  Edamame.  That stuff's great. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock, comment?  No comment.  Shouldn't you fight back a little bit?  Because that was really rude.  To a psycho?  No.  You think she's a huge fan of the show or what?  How fat is she?  She's not fat at all.  I have my...  This film's upside down.  How come the iPhone camera doesn't turn when you turn it, though?  That is odd sometimes.  How do you keep the video from going upside down?  I don't know.  Well, I can't get it. 
[01:36:30]  She wasn't fat at all.  She was in great shape.  No.  Was she good looking?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Just crazy?  Bad shit crazy?  Yeah.  Eric, comment?  You should fight back.  What am I going to say?  Fight back a little bit.  She says you're a big fat pig and you like donuts.  And if we have donuts, then you're our best friend.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Oh, come on.  He's not happy.  He's just...  How do I fucking...  Like, I was turning the camera because people kept gathering around her. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  But then the fucking iPhone camera films upside down.  What do you say?  You'll see it in a minute.  Did he turn it upside down?  Yeah, but it should just fucking keep it balanced.  Don't break it.  No, no, no.  Don't break it.  You don't know how mad I am that I didn't know Don Chee...  He's my...  He literally is probably my favorite actor.  If there's any actor I want to meet that's not Pacino or De Niro, it's Cheadle.  I love fucking Cheadle.  I'm sorry.  I never got that fucking email.  Thank you, buddy.  Danny, how bad is those lights? 
[01:37:30]  Sucker.  I saw you trying to cover your eyes.  Yeah, it sucks.  There's no way to walk down that hall without being blinded.  It's that bad, huh?  Yeah, it sucks.  It really sucks.  It doesn't seem like it's so in your face, but it's so concentrated that it's just right  the fuck there.  I'd like to have those.  I think Sam's getting another try.  Yeah, that's good.  Upside down.  I fucking hate...  Don't break it.  What the fuck is that?  Upside down.  Fix it in post. 
[01:38:00]  And you can't fast forward through it because whenever you stop it, it starts over.  Nope, nope.  That's your phone, Jimmy.  You can't do that.  I fucking hate it.  It hit the plastic, though.  It should be okay.  It's not good.  Let it break.  No, I don't think it's broke.  I don't even care if it is.  Let's buy another one.  I think it's okay.  Fucking piece of shit.  You got all your stuff.  Did you back up your stuff?  Yeah, it's all back up.  Okay.  Fucking hate Apple.  Not a fan of the Apple?  No.  Why?  Fucking cocksuckers and their lousy volume.  They had a great...  They do have horrible volume.  Oh, they fucking blow.  Why are they holding back their volume? 
[01:38:30]  I don't understand that either.  Oh, on the little speakers?  On everything, every product, the MacBook has the worst fucking volume.  They stink, dude.  They stink.  If you pop headphones on, it's fine.  I think it's all for battery conservation.  No, it's not.  It's so you buy their headphones.  It's so you buy headphones.  Really?  It's so you buy headphones.  It's so you buy external speakers, because they don't fuck you enough.  That's what it's for.  They did have a great quarter.  Of course.  They sure did.  They're not coming.  A shitload of money.  Stock went up like crazy.  So much weird stuff going on right now. 
[01:39:00]  I still got 10 minutes in my bad mood.  Jimmy's really annoyed, which will be the rest of the day.  Iraq, I don't know.  He's just depressed.  Iraq's cutting out templates.  Iraq?  What?  I had nothing to do with this.  I wasn't even in San Diego.  We just turned the mic on some of the fans.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Iraq, what do you think happened out there?  I appreciate getting a nice mention in this bit, and some exposure out in Comic-Con. 
[01:39:30]  But how do you think it went down?  Walk us through it.  Sam's like, hey, can you talk about how fat Iraq is, and make it sound like it was natural,  like you really listened to the show, and then we'll record it.  And then they gave her 20 bucks to try to meet Demetri Martin.  Well, no one's going to ever call you stupid.  I'll tell you that much.  Paranoid, maybe, because that's ridiculous.  Oh, that didn't happen, Sam.  No, it didn't happen. 
[01:40:00]  I'm sorry.  What other clips do we have?  I don't know.  Sam just burned another one.  Oh, my God.  What are the other ones?  Is that what we have from the first disc?  No, no, no.  And then we have...  Well, you got the whole special, so...  And we have some, you know...  And we'll play other...  I have more clips here, but we'll play clips all week, getting up to Thursday.  Yeah, but...  You want me to play this other clip from this broad?  That's Cass, yeah.  Her name is Cass.  Oh, E-Rock is a cow!  He's bigger than a pig, he's a cow! 
[01:40:30]  People don't like that guy so much, they don't even want to tantalize his tits!  What up?  What are you guys up to?  That fat pig, E-Rock, should get fired!  Why?  Because he sucks, and he can never arrive on time!  But I'm really trying to get some TV remarks!  Hey, Comic-Con!  Did you know that E-Rock is a big, fat cow, and he can never make it to work on time? 
[01:41:00]  Because he's always busy eating!  Holy shit.  I don't see E-Rock at his post anymore.  What the fuck?  Wow, that was unnecessarily brutal.  Jim and I thought so, too.  I hope the dance isn't on this tape.  The what?  The audio from the dance wasn't, uh...  What's the dance?  She just did the...  She did the E-Rock dance? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no.  She came up with the E-Rock dance?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She, uh...  Where did E-Rock go?  He's in there.  Just leaned back a little, chilling.  Phew.  E-Rock comment?  What is there to say?  Who are you mad at?  I bet that girl.  Not overall.  Cass.  Cass.  Like, who are you mad at right now?  I'm looking at him right now.  He's looking at me.  I don't know why. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, first of all, it's not like...  Because you're echoing the same laughter that was on the tape while you're sitting there  in the studio.  Whoa, forensics.  We're all laughing, and Jim's laugh is on the tape, too.  Yeah, but you're laughing.  I can't hear it, though, because it's on my phone, so why would I be able to get it off  my phone?  Jim showed some respect, Sam.  I heard him laughing on that CD just now.  He showed a little respect.  I mean, we were all laughing, and just now we were all laughing.  Yeah, but you laughed, looked at me, choked, turned around, and then started looking  down on the floor because you couldn't look at me.  Well, nobody ever...  We all said we couldn't look at you. 
[01:42:30]  You know, it's not...  Oof.  Just a cast knows the show.  People are just writing, holy shit.  Why?  Yeah, yeah.  They're just writing, holy shit.  Are they enjoying it?  I mean...  They usually have a lot to say, but today it's just, holy shit.  I think because it was so brutal.  It was just utter brutality.  That's what I thought, too.  That's why, I mean, if you'll notice, I didn't even want to give the clip in.  It was so brutal.  You do have fans.  Yeah.  A guy in Amarillo, Texas writes, that girl should be set on fire.  Annoying sea.  Oh.  Well, I mean, nobody said she was easy to deal with. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  I see her face.  Her body.  Was it any good?  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't, you know...  Comic-Con girl, right?  Is your phone still working?  Yeah, but...  That's a great commercial for Apple.  It's impossible to fast forward through a video on this fucking cunt garbage fucking phone.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, you don't need to be mad at me just for recording it.  You all right, E-Rock?  Yeah, let's see what other clips they got. 
[01:43:30]  There was a bunch.  I'm sure they all include me.  Well, E-Rock, you don't have to be egotistical.  It's not about you.  Oh, shit.  Really?  You turned this whole bit into me.  Ooh.  Oh.  Wow, Sam.  You kind of did.  It's supposed to be your moment.  My moment?  I was reporting for the show.  It's not my moment.  It's my moment.  We're talking to Elijah Wood.  Mm-hmm.  Talking to the Mythbusters.  That was nice.  And, yeah, I mean, Danny's not in here getting all, you know, huffy-puffy because, you know,  Jim asked about his Twitter. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  That is true.  I mean, everybody, you know.  Danny took it in stride.  Of course, because he knows it's just fun and games.  E-Rock, why didn't you take it in stride?  Why not?  Like Danny did.  It's a good point.  Okay, well, Danny had just been texting, oh, I'm sorry, Twittering to Carrie about coming  out and visiting the set and getting some stuff at Comic-Con, whereas Sam had some psychopath  scream at the top of her lungs that I like donuts and that I'm fat and comparing me to 
[01:44:30]  farm animals.  So you're saying Danny-  What farm animals?  I didn't hear that in there.  Was she saying-  Pig, cow.  Yeah, I just wanted him to say it.  Surprised no whales in there.  Whales not on any farm.  They're getting sick.  That's obvious.  But you're saying that Danny made his bed, whereas you did absolutely nothing, and all  of a sudden you're being attacked by some psychopath on the floor.  I'm not attacking Danny.  Danny didn't do anything wrong.  No.  You just said he Twittered-  No, I didn't.  Because that's what he did. 
[01:45:00]  That's what the audio said.  I'm not saying he did anything wrong.  Right, but you're saying that we brought him up because-  I didn't even bring him up.  You brought him up.  I know.  Nobody's attacking Danny.  No, you're attacking me.  What?  Who?  What is going on, Eric?  Eric, you all right?  You okay, buddy?  I'm just getting really mad.  Move on to the next I'm fat, stupid, whatever bit, and let's go.  Eric, it's not about you here.  We're trying to talk about Comic-Con.  Really?  This might hurt your friendship.  You think so?  Yeah, you guys got that nice chemistry in the 10 o'clock hour. 
[01:45:30]  You might be ruining that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, I didn't think this would happen.  Are you going to be able to get over this, Eric?  I'm already over it.  That's good.  It doesn't sound like it.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, I mean, again, we did lots of stuff at Comic-Con.  I didn't realize this was going to turn into the Eric show again.  You are a fucking...  People rather hear this than you, so it's all right.  Oh, damn.  I mean, I guess then I'll just try to give the people what they want. 
[01:46:00]  More Eric material.  That's what you do best.  Eric material?  Thank you.  You focus on me.  Okay.  I don't know if that's an insult.  I could have laid one in there, but I didn't.  Go ahead.  Open form.  No, no.  I didn't.  I didn't.  What was it going to be?  Because now I'm curious.  No, no.  It wasn't...  You're not really saying it because you did it?  Because it wasn't that good.  But now I'm curious.  Yeah.  Yeah, it wasn't that good. 
[01:46:30]  No?  Yeah.  You could kind of say it was focus on him, you know, the whole thing where it probably  wouldn't be hard to, you know.  Oh, a size comment.  Are you saying because...  I'm only asking to clarify the joke.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of his obesity, he's always in your sight line.  Right, right.  Never really in your peripheral, in your direct line of sight all the time, which would be 
[01:47:00]  virtually impossible unless you had something of such mass, like that of a sun or...  Well, speaking of that, Ant, you think he could block out this light so Greenstein doesn't  see it?  It would be good to see a corona around him, for those of you that like eclipse jokes.  The corona.  He just did an eclipse joke.  He did an eclipse joke.  Mike Tyson might have just walked by the studio.  What?  Was that Mike Tyson?  I don't know.  It was a bald black guy.  Well, I don't think it was Mike Tyson. 
[01:47:30]  You sure?  I mean, I can't be sure.  I don't think it was.  All right, we should break.  Doug Stanhope's going to join the show.  We have more clips from Comic-Con.  Yes, we do.  Some good ones, too.  Yeah, we do.  I want to hear.  Yes.  Do you have Chip?  Yeah, we have Chip.  Oh, God.  I mean, Eric thinks they're all Eric clips coming up, but I hate to disappoint.  E-Rock.  It's not all about you.  It's not.  It's for me.  Let me say hi before the break to Don in Jersey.  Don, very upset.  Don, go ahead. 
[01:48:00]  What's up, guys?  Listen, I know this is Sam's cute little bit.  Oh, I'm a bully on the air because I'm all smart.  The only thing that was ever intimidating about that faggot was everybody thought he might  have been black.  He doesn't even have that for him anymore.  That's true.  He got it.  DNA came back.  Fucking annoying prick.  Oh, I've got to get on the air.  It's my show from 10 to 11.  It is.  Oh, you faggot.  Wow.  Wow.  We don't use the F word here in the studio.  Yeah, I didn't think we did, but...  I mean, it is. 
[01:48:30]  I just say no to the F...  You're saying no to the F word?  R word.  Yes, the R word I'm not using anymore.  I think Justin Bieber is saying no to the R word in song now.  Is he in song?  That's right here.  Oh, I'd love to hear that one.  You want to hear real quick?  Yes, please.  You've got to be kidding me.  No, I'm not kidding you.  And he has a huge fucking fan base.  Oh, and that too.  Do we have it in the system? 
[01:49:00]  I don't think we do.  Well, maybe I just dreamed this.  Yeah, I know.  That would be fucked up.  You just come in and go, yeah, this is a great thing.  Oh, fuck, wait a minute.  I dreamt that.  I'm really not sure now.  You're just in this daze of insomnia and half a sleeve.  You're like Tyler Durden.  I haven't slept in.  You don't even know.  I haven't had one good night's sleep in a year.  Maybe that was one of my dreams.  I don't know now.  That's fucking hilarious. 
[01:49:30]  I think I just jumped that shit.  Did I just dream that?  I mean, I don't.  I will figure it out during the break.  Doug Stanhope next.  A little later today.  Andrew Dice Clay.  And we'll check in with Jimmy and his iPhone as well.  Looks like it's working pretty good, even though you slammed it against the wall.  Yeah, he's still trying to make it work.  It's fine.  Oh, it's working?  Yeah.  The Cheeto thing?  That's what I imagine.  It is what it is.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  No.  I took my headphones off for the break, and then I had to put them back on because I didn't  hear anything.  I thought it was just the headphones, but then I realized there just wasn't anything  being said.  And you put the headphones on because you didn't want us talking about you.  No, I could see it.  You're right next to me.  And if anyone's going to be talking about, it's going to be E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  We're all scared to take our headphones off because we might be talked about. 
[01:50:30]  That's why radio people wear headphones.  We don't need them.  It's just out of sheer paranoia and fucking horrid self-worth that we have to constantly be aware  of what people are saying around us.  Isn't that the truth?  Because you can whisper stuff in here.  Yeah, yeah.  And you would never hear it, Ed.  Yeah, yeah.  E-Rock wants a donut.  Oh, I read it off a...  Like something like that.  But I wouldn't...  Matt and East Meadow, I read it off a placemat. 
[01:51:00]  Maybe I did.  Oh, did you read it off a placemat?  I remember that.  You're telling me Justin Bieber doesn't have an N-word song?  N-word?  You said R-word.  Oh, no.  N-word.  Did I say R-word?  You said R-word.  Oh, no, man.  He went for the big one.  The N-word.  He did.  Do we have it now?  I mean, there's a...  I'm assuming there's a parody called Never Say N-Word instead of Never Say Never.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  No, that's a...  It's a parody.  They bleeped never to sound like...  Oh.  Oh, really?  Never Say Never?  Never Say Never.  Oh, they kind of just took the sound out instead of...  They're doing, like, the bleep game with it.  Right.  Oh.  No.  Maybe that's what you saw?  That's stupid.  I stopped the show for a cheap parody.  Oh, no.  Doug Stanhope next.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Are you in a committed relationship and struggling to stroke the flames of passion?

[01:53:00]  The Virus.  The Opin' Anthony Show.  Got that right.  Doug Stanhope in studio.  What's up, Doug?  How are you, Doug?  How are you, brother?  I'm there and I'm there and I'm there and I'm there.  Opin' Anthony.  Oh, we're on the air?  Yes!  Yeah, very good.  On the air with the lovely and talented Doug Stanhope.  Hey, how are you?  All right.  How you doing?  You like our lights when you're walking down the hall?  A bit bright, huh?  Yeah, it's on purpose. 
[01:53:30]  It's a long story.  Yeah.  We won't bother you with the light thing.  But now we're just trying to annoy people.  It was horrifying.  I will tell you this.  We did, in Morse Code, we...  How do you say it?  Suck a dick.  Well, I know that part, but how do you say it, though?  We Morse Coded...  We could broadcast in life, so I think we broadcast in Morse Code.  In Morse Code, we did suck a dick with the lights.  It's a first for radio, Doug.  It's a first for radio.  I don't think I'm going to get this.  Dot, dot, dash.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we were supposed to get better lights in the studio, and they kind of fucked that up. 
[01:54:00]  They fuck up everything.  They can't do the basics for this radio show.  So now we're making everyone suffer.  I think it's cool.  It's kind of like what they did to Noriega.  Yeah.  They were trying to get him out of his house, you know, blasting music and lights and stuff.  Right, lights.  We're just more obnoxious than ever, Doug.  All right.  We've given up.  All right.  It sounds like it.  There's a freedom.  It sounds like we're waiting to go back on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes that's the best radio, though. 
[01:54:30]  So I still think that's a compliment.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a freedom in just giving up.  Yeah, no.  I've stopped giving a fuck, and I feel so much better.  Yeah, it's not complete, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Every little step that you just...  I don't really care.  Yeah.  None of that bothers me anymore.  I used to care about so many things that would...  And they were, at the time, so fucking important to me.  And now it's just like, bah.  Yeah.  I miss not having anything I want. 
[01:55:00]  That sucks.  There's nothing I look forward to either.  Nothing I look forward to.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, makes your life go by really quickly.  Yeah.  When you were a kid, remember how long a year took as a kid?  Oh, God.  Like, a year took forever, because you were constantly waiting for things.  Right.  Your birthday and Christmas and summer vacation and all that shit.  Like, you were constantly waiting for something to happen.  And then you get older.  You don't give a shit.  And then you're constantly trying to put off shit.  Right.  Like, bills and things like that.  Yeah, I'm just trying to get through something. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Oh, shit.  So time goes by real quick.  So this is better.  No, time slows down if you don't care as much.  Because you're not looking forward to things.  If you're in a Chilean mind, time probably creeps, too.  And you go, wow.  No, when you're looking forward to things, it takes forever.  Remember how long the last week before Christmas took as a kid?  Oh, so now you're saying the time is faster?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a bad part of not giving a fuck.  All right.  I'm in now.  It's the bad part of not giving a fuck.  I'm in now.  When you cared about things and, like, waited for shit. 
[01:56:00]  And like I said, that last week before Christmas when you were a kid, it might as well have  been a fucking month.  It took forever.  We have 14 months left on our contract.  That's going to take a long fuck.  No, that's a long time because it's arduous and it's dealing with these people and it  sucks.  So that's good because it makes, you know, your life seem a little longer.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  But otherwise, you know, not giving a shit.  That's the only bad part of it.  But the other part is this freeing of like, wow, that would have bothered me years ago.  Now, I just don't give a shit.  Yeah.  No, I agree wholeheartedly. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  What have you been up to, man?  What are you?  You're gigging?  I have no.  No.  What have I been up to?  Yeah.  I was in Canada for a couple of weeks and now I'm going to London for a month.  London?  Yeah.  How is it over there?  I've never done it.  Before I was in New London, Connecticut.  That's what I thought.  Now, I hate it.  I hate being, especially in London, but the UK itself is just, it's just awful and dank  and ugly and crowded and overpriced and everything sucks.  I bet.  But the audiences are cool, are they? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  But that's, yeah, I could really give a shit less if I get booed off stage or a standing  round of applause.  Give me some pounds, motherfucker.  Yeah.  I mean, I've welled up with tears at how bad the food is, where you go, you can't possibly,  this is something simple.  No one goes to an English place.  I've been here for three weeks and not one thing.  And I'm not, I don't, I'm not like a food guy.  I just, I need to eat and like everything is so awful.  So bland.  Yeah.  You would think some guy from America would go over there and go, look, this is how you 
[01:57:30]  eat.  I don't know how they have all the fucking celebrity chefs, like the Gordon Ramsay guy  and that Jamie Oliver faggot.  They're all fucking English.  How are they all English and you can't find anything to do?  It seems like a great business just set up an American restaurant over there.  You know what, how many English restaurants are there?  You don't, you never go, let's order out English.  Yeah.  You know, what do we got?  Chinese, got a Mexican menu.  Here's the Italian place.  Let's order English.  I would say fucking Quiznos.  I'd probably like, all right. 
[01:58:00]  Just Quiznos.  Exactly.  And I get a roast beef sandwich and I go, yeah, just mustard mayonnaise.  They didn't have yellow mustard.  They had this like, they had some Dijon stuff.  Oh, I prefer the spicier.  I love a yellow mustard.  This is like thick with seeds.  I like that.  Like just chunky mustard.  Yeah.  God damn it.  It's like a hepatitis load.  I don't understand why people go to like a place like Subway or Quiznos or anything.  Well, although they do sponsor and I understand people do go there and like it. 
[01:58:30]  And if you enjoy it, that's fine.  I do Subway.  But I would just go to a fucking deli.  Go to a good deli where you can tell them, could you fucking, I want that ham and I want  it sliced paper fucking thin and I want it on a roll with mustard.  Like, like it seems like everything's pre-done and they take these slices that are too fucking  thick and put it on the sandwich and it's like five pieces of this.  Right.  And you get the fucking dummy behind the counter, five pieces of cheese. 
[01:59:00]  They weigh your sandwich.  Yeah, fuck that.  And then they take some back.  Like, what?  You can't take meat back after you put it on the sandwich.  Awesome.  German guy at a deli loading fucking ham on top of a fat sandwich.  Where your mouth hurts after you try to fucking eat the damn thing.  It's fantastic.  Like a giant black cock in your mouth.  Oh, wait.  Maybe I could have used a better example.  Oh, you couldn't have.  What says deliciousness like that?  Those two dark, angry hands holding your head. 
[01:59:30]  Slim, athletic fingers.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  What brings you to New York, dog?  Anything good?  I'm doing John Stossel tonight.  You do a lot of that.  That's like a real fucking...  Yeah, Fox I do.  They don't...  And what's Stossel on CNN?  He's on Fox Business Network.  So, yeah, this is part of my big media push. 
[02:00:00]  What are you promoting?  I don't even know what I'm doing on the show.  They said, oh, well, we'll talk to him when he gets here.  I have no idea what I'm doing.  It's called Common Sense with John Stossel.  Is that it?  I guess so, yeah.  I only saw one episode, so that didn't clue me in.  It's not like a panel show.  It just keeps revolving guests through.  Really?  It keeps all the guys from Reason Magazine in...  Look at that block in the light.  That's who I thought.  The one that just walked by.  And that's who I thought was Tyson, by the way.  So, it's not Tyson. 
[02:00:30]  Okay.  No.  Who are those people?  I don't know.  Why is he walking around with a phone receiver?  A red phone receiver.  Like an oldie time...  That was like the bat phone receiver.  That's his bit.  What is he?  Is he some kind of rapper that walks around with a red phone?  Sam, you know all this stuff.  No, is he doing Chantilly Lace?  Hello, baby.  Fucking horrible big bopper.  The stage was the best with all the phones.  Yeah, and he would just talk...  Oh, yeah, hello.  Hello.  Yeah, with different types of phones.  The fancy ones.  Who would enjoy that?  No one. 
[02:01:00]  Fucking asshole.  Not God.  God hated it.  Jesus.  Do you still do that Greg Gutfeld guy?  The red eye thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, you don't like him?  I love Gutfeld.  Oh, no, I did it once, and I'd watched it, and I wrote a bunch of topical shit to be  on there, and then he goes, oh, yeah, you're not on the panel.  I'm just going to interview you.  Oh, you just did the interview?  Yeah, but then he's hauled dumb questions.  Just stuff he read off my website.  So what's up with your belly button? 
[02:01:30]  I had an umbilical hernia.  I got nothing to say about it.  I just sat there looking like a dick, and he's asking me boring questions.  You should be on the panel.  I was prepared to be on the panel, so, yeah, that didn't pan out well.  No.  They're very popular on the West Coast.  I get a lot of recognition on the West Coast, because it airs three hours earlier there.  It's like three here, and midnight there.  Yeah, because it's three in the morning here.  Yeah, that's a little hard to say.  Yeah, it's a little harder.  It's DVR.  It's great to plug West Coast.  Oh, you DVR.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a sweetheart. 
[02:02:00]  When I'd seen the show, it was really, really fucking annoying.  But then I got there, and the guy was overly gushingly sweet.  And then I sucked.  So that's how it went.  That's how that one went?  Eh.  So what are you going to do when you're here?  You look healthier.  You're going to have fun.  You look on the drugs.  I didn't land until 2.30 in the morning, so, yeah, I'm fucking out of my mind.  And so, yeah, I'm doing that, and some stuff for Roadrunner Records, and I don't even know 
[02:02:30]  what.  Yeah.  Some shit, and then John Stossel, and then Flyback.  Are you promoting a CD?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I have a CD.  You really are pushing it.  It's live from Oslo, which now is kind of more fun.  Oh, wow.  Look at that, huh?  Burning the bridge to nowhere.  Wow.  That's some, uh...  And it truly is live from Oslo?  Yeah, yeah, it's live from Oslo. 
[02:03:00]  How was that?  I don't know.  I'm trying to find a tie-in to the shooting that's funny, and I was hoping Norton would  pick up the slack on that.  I think just the story itself.  It's too soon, Jimmy.  It's just fucking...  It's too soon.  It is funny how that fucking Amy Winehouse dying just booted fucking 90 dead people  off the front page.  Like, it still was a big story.  Oh, they pushed that.  Drudge fucking smashed that right off when Amy Winehouse died, which are 90 dead people.  Jimmy, what's your take on the Amy Winehouse?  She's dead. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, she's dead, right?  That's my take on it, too, by the way.  People can set it first.  I went from second to fifth, and we have a celebrity death pool.  Wow.  There's only 11 people in it, and four of them had Amy Winehouse.  Wow.  You start the year with 20 celebrities.  Four out of 11 people had Amy Winehouse.  Wow.  She was great, man.  It's like, I was thinking, like, it's easy that we talk about, like, fucking Morrison and  all these people who were 27 when they died, and we look back, like, oh, she doesn't belong 
[02:04:00]  in that club.  She sang as fucking well as Janis Joplin did, or fucking Morrison.  I think she was as good of an artist as those guys were.  They just had more of a catalog, though.  Yeah.  And they also had a mystique.  Yeah, I got it.  Especially they had a mystique, because there was no TMZ documenting every single move.  Every move.  So we look back at them like they're legends, instead of going, what an asshole.  Because we don't see every move they make.  You weren't watching it unfold as it was happening.  Who's on the list?  You got Brian Jones from the Stones.  Right.  Morrison.  Kurt Cobain.  Kurt Cobain.  Janis, and I think Hendrix, right? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  I grew up knowing all of their songs, though.  I mean, Amy Winehouse, do you know her B-sides?  Oh, that was the third song on the second side of that album.  I don't know anything she's done, but I don't know that...  She had at least three big songs off that album, right?  Yeah.  She was not as popular as those, you know.  I just think as a Ross singer, I think she was as good.  It's just a waste.  I mean, she had all the talent in the world.  You were saying during the break.  Just watching this acoustic stuff. 
[02:05:00]  Would I have seen her live?  No.  I think she kind of sucked live.  See her dead?  I'd love to.  Grab her breasts.  She was good, though, man.  Oh, she was awful.  She was Lady Gaga ugly without all the pancake stuff to do.  You don't think she's pretty, either.  I don't get it.  And the fake blonde hair.  Lady Gaga is not a good-looking woman.  She's got a great body, though.  I think she's sexy.  She has a horrible face.  Yeah.  You should go to the acoustic. 
[02:05:30]  Robert Johnson dead at 27 for some of the old blues guys.  Thanks, Kevin.  The blues.  I think everyone knows that, though.  I don't know what she's doing.  But it was a weird...  It's not my style of music, really, but...  Meet you downstairs in the bar at her.  You've rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt.  You say, why did you do with him today?  And sniff me out like I was tackled. 
[02:06:00]  Forget how good-looking she was.  At one point, yeah.  Look how good-looking she is in this video.  She had, like, that smoke...  I mean, comparatively speaking, is what I'm saying.  At the end of her life, it was hard to look at her.  Well, she had some meat on her bones right there.  Yeah.  She had, like, a smoky, weird blues voice without trying to...  Like, that was, like, the way she sang.  It's, like, effortless.  Effortless is absolutely the word there.  But, yeah, I know that song.  I've never heard her before.  Find the acoustic rehab.  You know, hey, you opened my eyes to so many new experiences. 
[02:06:30]  Yes.  Too late.  Yeah, a little late.  You know the rehab song, of course.  I don't think so.  The acoustic version is fucking very good.  She's on a sofa.  You can avoid the rehab song, man, if you're just walking through life.  Oh, that was, like, everywhere.  You had to have known this one, Doug.  Give him rehab real fast.  I'm pretty sure I've avoided it.  You might.  You probably heard it.  Ah, ladies and gentlemen.  Ah.  All right.  Winehouse.  Funny, this is from last night, too, which is amazing. 
[02:07:00]  How Dave got her.  That's amazing.  Tonight is making her American television debut.  Her CD is entitled Back to Black.  Please welcome Amy Winehouse.  That was God right there.  Just introing her.  It's kind of when we go to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you're blue.  No, no, no.  I ain't got a time. 
[02:07:30]  What is it, 1963?  Yeah.  My dad thinks I'm fine.  Just try to make me go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  No, that somehow escaped me.  Wow.  That was a big hit.  Well, she's singing it a little differently, too.  But she gets into it.  She was, she just, there's no effort to it when she sings.  What was your point during the break?  I loved it.  You said she was the real deal and she wasn't some kind of.  She wasn't one of these fucking, I mean, again, I don't say it's a good way to live.  That's a dumb way to live. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, but.  But she wasn't one of these phony, fucking, corny, fake maverick rockers trying to pretend  they have like this heroin sheik going on.  I'm like, I'm so fucked up.  I'm so, whoa, are you okay?  I'm so fucked up.  Oh, fuck yourself.  She was a true disaster.  Give me an example.  Who would fit that bill?  Oh, we've been out of a million.  You're not talking about like, what's his name?  Stone Temple Pilots.  That guy's an actual.  He really is a disaster. 
[02:08:30]  I just, I just find that these guys embrace the image of that.  And she was just like, get away from me.  And then she just holed up and died.  She was infronted.  Yeah, but no, don't ask you for an example.  I probably should think of one.  I like a Lindsay Lohan, even though she's not in the music business.  A bunch of the bands when we used to go to Oz.  That's like someone that I look at as kind of a, you know, even though she could easily die.  Yeah, yeah, she could.  But she, yeah, she kind of embraces the image. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, she, yeah.  Like Hedberg was a perfect drug guy for a comic.  He was a guy he never, you know, he was never shaky.  Oh, I should really rethink what I'm doing.  Really?  Yeah, or pushing.  Obviously, he wasn't outspoken about drugs.  He wasn't celebrating it.  But he was, you know, it was pretty constant straight through.  Yeah.  I thought the same thing when he died.  Like, that's just dumb.  Like, you're fucking so good at what you do.  What are you doing?  I felt it more when he died because I knew him. 
[02:09:30]  But it's like, you look at someone like that and it's like, eh.  What the fuck, man?  You were very good at this.  You would have had a great life and all these years ahead of you and it just fucking flushed  it for nothing.  It's a waste.  It's a fucking waste.  Go make a legend out of yourself.  But I mean, you know what I'm saying?  Hedberg was a fucking really good comic, man.  And it's like not, it's not any more tragic when a singer or a comic dies than a fucking  housewife.  I mean, in the grand scheme of things.  Yeah.  You know.  I don't listen to housewives.  But yeah, you can get someone else to do your socks. 
[02:10:00]  That is true.  You can find someone else to take a loan.  I stand corrected.  Seth writes, there was a great video of her performing where she reaches into her beehive  hairdo, grabs a bullet and bumps a line on stage.  Oh, really?  She didn't fucking play, man.  I liked her, man.  I was never a huge fan.  But like watching her and just listening to her for the last few days, because that's  what you do when someone's dead.  Yeah.  And then you go back to your Aussie, right?  Of course.  Yeah.  She wasn't overrated.  But you're right.  We all do this.  As a performer.  When these guys die and these gals die, their record sales go through the fucking roof. 
[02:10:30]  I'm playing a fucking Amy Winehouse song tonight on my Boneyard show.  And I've never played it.  I've played a few weird ones, like a Beatles song here and there.  But it's like I'm playing a completely weird Amy Winehouse song.  Which one?  To know him is to love him.  Oh, that's a good song.  Her version of it's fucking, fuck Dolly Parton.  Her version of it's just better.  Dolly Parton did that one?  Yeah, they all did.  I think they all went back.  Yeah, that's how old it is.  They all did it.  I don't know why I have to attack Dolly Parton.  Oh, fuck her.  She had big great tits.  Are you doing a podcast now? 
[02:11:00]  No.  All right.  But you're just doing another show on SiriusXM?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's a music show on the Boneyard.  All right.  Everyone's doing a show here.  Other shows.  Yeah, we're all just figuring it out.  Sam's doing like 15 fucking shows on the platform.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just, they know how to get their money's, their fucking money's worth.  They know how to get their fucking cracker worth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you ask for your raise?  Come on, Sam.  All right.  Huh?  No.  You didn't ask for your raise this week?  I haven't had any meetings with management this week. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  Well, let's get them in here.  Stop fucking around.  Play it out right here.  Let's do this.  We're in a weird place, Doug, if you haven't figured it out yet.  Yeah, no, it's definitely a different feeling here today.  Sam, who represents the entire staff here, because I don't want the other staff to think  we're playing favorites.  None of them have had a raise in a long fucking time.  And we use Sam as a very good example, and he's drastically underpaid, and the boss has  actually spun it that it's his fault because he's not asking for a raise enough. 
[02:12:00]  Well, it was very public at one point.  But they want him to be stopping into the office and remind them and have a conversation.  Well, let's go down there.  Me and you?  Yeah, I'm in a shitty mood.  Why are you in a shitty mood?  It's just I haven't slept at all.  So it just kind of wears on you a bit?  Sitting on a fucking tarmac in Birmingham, Alabama, waiting for Atlanta to open up to  make my connection.  Why was it closed?  Weather. 
[02:12:30]  Storms, I guess.  Yeah, that's why they close it.  How long did you sit there?  Never really an asteroid.  Less than an hour.  It wasn't bad.  My brother had the same thing happen when he left my house with his daughter, but he  was stuck there for three hours sitting on the plane.  We were only there for less than an hour.  I came right here from the airport.  I'm tired.  Everyone's exhausted today.  I think that's why we're all a little edgy.  I can't tell you the murderous rage that hit me before.  It's fucking amazing.  Murderous rage.  Dude, it's so like, it hits so- 
[02:13:00]  Oh, with Don Cheadle?  Yeah, it just-  We had Don Cheadle in here yesterday.  It just annoyed me that I didn't know him.  And Jimmy wasn't around.  I'm not mad that I wasn't here, but it's fine.  Whatever.  We did an amazing interview with the guy, too.  Oh, yeah.  Three seconds.  It was really good.  Really good.  Three seconds of him saying hi.  Well, it was great.  What do you do again?  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle.  And Jimmy's mad, because if he knew ahead of time, he would have got something signed.  Because I just love him.  I really like Don Cheadle.  But he'll come back, no? 
[02:13:30]  No.  I don't know if he will.  It's just an odd guy to be that upset about.  I mean, I like him just fine.  There's very few actors that move me like he does.  It sounds weird, but he really does.  I don't know.  Hotel Rwanda.  It was great.  It's a good comedy.  I mean, seeing if I can name three movies he's been in.  I relate to the fucking radio hosts.  Yeah, those guys are great.  Saying something and getting a lot of people killed.  I'd love to have that power.  There's one you should really know.  There's Ocean's Eleven.  Wasn't he in that?  He was in that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  I just pulled that out.  But he was.  Everyone was in it.  Yeah.  I hope to.  But there's one biggie, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one that was really good.  Good.  That's, yeah, I'm stuck.  He was amazing in Boogie Nights.  That's the one.  Boogie Nights.  He was amazing in Crash.  I thought he was fucking great in Crash.  I don't know if I've seen Crash.  Boogie Nights was great.  All right.  Want to open the stereo place?  I saw that in a discount theater in L.A.  Oh, shit.  With my girlfriend at the time and her friend. 
[02:14:30]  And there was a guy jerking off in the movie theater.  That was me.  That's how good he was.  His performance.  He kept looking back at me.  And my girlfriend.  Oh, shit.  I'm like, what the fuck is this guy's problem?  How long ago was this that you're in a movie theater?  It was right after it came out.  Oh, yeah.  When it would have gone to the discount theater.  Wow.  At one point, I just, I leaned in to stare.  Because he kept turning around to look at my girlfriend.  So I put my face like inches behind his head.  So when he turned around, I'd be right there. 
[02:15:00]  And when I did that, I could see.  He was just fucking beating off.  Was he packing?  Thank you, sir.  He was a fat Negro.  How big was his penis?  I don't remember.  It was a blur.  Literally.  On the screen.  Did he turn around away from you when he saw your face?  He saw me get up to go get the manager.  Then he ran out the emergency exit.  Stopped jacking.  Yeah.  You fucking cock blocker.  Yeah, I know.  Sucked. 
[02:15:30]  Fucked up his whole day.  That's my done.  John Cheadle story.  It's better than mine.  I don't remember the last time I went to a movie theater.  Do not even fucking remember.  It was Jackass 2.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's how long ago.  Wow.  Not Jackass in 3D?  No, no.  That was fucking great to see in a theater.  That was a good one to see with a lot of people.  Some movies are absolutely good to see with a lot of people still.  Fuck people.  No, in general.  I can't do it.  In general, I'm with you.  You don't want to be in a theater with everyone else. 
[02:16:00]  But Jackass 3 was such a great fucking.  Maybe theaters are too stressful for me.  Well, they're stressful for everyone.  It's a lot of stress.  Like, ah, I got to get in.  Ah, my seat.  Ah, there's no fucking seat.  And then I know Seinfeld did a whole thing about saving a seat and how stressful that is.  When someone goes, ah, I'm going to go fucking grab some Twizzlers or something.  Save a seat.  And then people are always trying to come in.  You got to, no, it's saved.  And it's just fucking, it's too much stress. 
[02:16:30]  And then is somebody going to sit in front of me that's 10 feet tall?  Now I'm looking around them.  And people are yapping or their phones are going off.  I don't need that shit.  Roland's the worst.  He saves more than one because he wants room on both sides.  And even, I mean, the movie was starting and these two people, like, are those seats taken?  And he still said yes.  Really?  So now these people are scrambling and trying to find.  That's ballsy.  One of them had to sit in the front row.  The other was in the back.  That's a ballsy thing.  Roland does not give in.  It's so uncomfortable to see. 
[02:17:00]  It annoys the piss out of me when somebody too tall sits in front of me.  I hate it.  And then you got to go to one side.  And then depending on the scene, you're moving your head back and forth to see, like, the whole fucking screen.  The seats kill my ass.  I'd rather, I mean, I end up watching them in hotels is where I end up seeing most things.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where I see most things, in hotels or, you know, screener copies.  I love the screener copy.  Yeah, at home when you, you can pause shit, go take a dump. 
[02:17:30]  Why would I want to sit through at some fucking shit theater with a bunch of dumb fuck people?  I don't want to be around.  Language.  You can't piss.  You can't take a dump.  You can't do anything or you're going to miss part of the fucking movie you paid to see.  Fuck that.  Your home pause.  Boom.  Good.  Exactly.  Make myself a drink.  Exactly.  Clink, clink, clink, clink.  Clink, clink, clink.  I might have seen fucking, the last thing I might have seen might have been Dark Knight in theater.  Wow.  That's a wow.  Damn.  There might have been one thing after that, I think.  I don't remember what it was.  Fuck. 
[02:18:00]  We just went and saw Harry Potter.  Exactly.  I don't know it.  I don't know the lead up story.  They're not.  I mean, the movies aren't bad.  They're okay, right?  Yeah, they're really not that bad.  The first one was a kid's movie.  After that, they decided we need to get a little darker to get...  Maybe I'll do a festival.  Other people.  Check it out.  One fucking weekend or something.  That's why I had the theater put in the house.  And I love being able to scream things out in my own theater.  Jimmy's heard it a few times.  Yes, it's the same thing.  He screams in the jacuzzi, the pool, and the car.  I yell out racial epithets. 
[02:18:30]  Because I know that there's no one in there that's going to be offended.  Is it just...  Like, shut the fucking phone off, and then I'll say something horrid.  You know?  Keep it down, you motherfucking...  And then I'll say something horrible.  Are you by yourself?  Oh, yeah.  I've done it by myself.  You just laugh.  Everyone laughs.  It's freeing, right?  Oh, it's so freeing.  Love it.  There's no fucking assholes in my theater.  It's great.  Pause it. 
[02:19:00]  Love that shit.  Does the comedy business...  Do you ever bring in people of color or different races just to yell at them?  No, no, not just to yell.  That would kind of be a good idea if I wasn't worried.  To hire a guy.  What's happening?  But, yeah.  I think the only person of color to ever have been at my house is Patrice.  Listen, I'm going to be yelling nigger quite a bit, and your role...  Your role is to be, like, pissed off...  Is to be scared and run away from me.  Yeah, but then I'm going to confront you, and you run away, because I really want it 
[02:19:30]  to be nothing like real life.  Yeah.  I'll yell that at you, and you go, I'm sorry, is my phone too loud?  And you turn it off.  Anthony's fantasy.  Yes.  Could you call management on me for being too loud?  That'd be great.  You were about to say the only person of color in your house.  Oh, it was Patrice.  It is, right?  Patrice came over for a party.  That was it.  It was great.  I had a great time.  Have you had Asians?  Did you get a lot of pictures?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a lot of pictures just to show people.  I hang them up on the walls.  It's great. 
[02:20:00]  Can you put on a hat in this one and maybe my denim jacket so it looks like you've been  here a couple times?  Yeah, a few times.  Change it.  Wait for the sun to go down a little.  You didn't throw any furniture away, did you?  No.  Very good.  You didn't drain the pool?  No.  Very good.  You're not that bad then.  You have them change outfits at the same party and stand different places, like half a facing,  like that way.  So it looks like there's a bunch of guys, like it was a party of diversity.  Instead of just Waldo in different places.  There is really zilch diversity at my house. 
[02:20:30]  Find Luther.  That's how, you know, I always said we're just, we're creatures like any other animal.  And, you know, pride of lions so that they don't hang out with zebras unless they're ripping  their throats out.  Because they're a different species.  Well, whatever.  We're not a different species.  We're just different, you know, members of the same species.  Do you hear from Butters anymore?  No.  Butters hasn't.  He wanted to make me a necklace and he wanted me to measure my neck.  A pro one.  I don't fucking know how to measure my neck. 
[02:21:00]  He was being really nice.  He got a hold of me through my YouTube channel and he's like, I really want to make this necklace  for you.  I know you're going to like it.  He's like, I need you to measure your neck.  I'm like, how do you do that?  I'll do it for you with a noose.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Because I think it meant like where it would hang and all that shit.  Oh, right.  It's got to hang.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Make the necklace.  I'll figure it out.  Make a necklace.  That's an old Sarah Silverman joke about her neck is her prettiest feature.  It's four inches long, flaccid. 
[02:21:30]  So I haven't heard from Butters since then.  I hope he's not mad.  No, he doesn't get mad.  Because I didn't measure my neck.  He listens, right?  Occasionally?  I don't know.  I'm assuming.  He's moving out of Bisbee.  He's going to college.  Oh, yeah.  Might already be there, yeah.  He's a college kid now?  Yeah.  Moved to Tucson.  You're still out there?  Yeah.  Bisbee?  Mm-hmm.  Bisbee.  You with the same girl?  Yeah.  Bingo.  It's a while, right?  Six years, yeah.  Wow, damn. 
[02:22:00]  Look at you go.  Yeah.  You a kid?  No.  No.  Not that I know of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get a vasectomy.  Did you?  Yeah.  I had an abortion with Renee years ago.  Yeah.  Does Renee want the world to know that?  Well, I didn't use your full name.  I don't know if I know.  Actually, yeah.  I got like an eight-minute bit about it on a DVD from some time long ago.  But yeah, then I had to get the vasectomy because I didn't think I could knock anyone 
[02:22:30]  up.  I just assumed I'd sterilize myself through my lifestyle.  Yes, I could have.  Are your loads any different, though, with the fucking vasectomy?  I heard they cut your loads in half.  No.  No, they weren't any different.  They don't look different?  They're not clear and just awful?  No.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy's thinking of something.  Same old load.  And again, I should get fucking snipped.  Well, after what she went through with her abortion, I...  That makes me not want to.  Well, no, no.  Oh.  I had to do it. 
[02:23:00]  Like, I'm not a guy who...  I don't easily go into medical procedures, but after her...  It was a rough abortion.  She did a morning after pill, and it took, like, days.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she had to go back in.  Was it a little late term?  No, no, no.  It was just the pill didn't...  It wasn't just...  It wasn't a snappy thing.  It was pretty ugly.  Oh, wow.  Then I really couldn't complain about having my bag cut open.  Jeez.  How'd they do it? 
[02:23:30]  Were you awake for it?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little local.  It doesn't hurt except in your head.  There's no pain, but just knowing what they're doing...  Right, right.  It would make you, like, queasy or something.  I was on the phone.  I was eating Fritos and talking to people on the phone.  Just anything to pretend that this isn't going on.  How long did it take?  It was a matter of minutes.  Probably 10 minutes or something.  Where do they slice your bag?  A small incision on each side, and then they pull out the Vast Deference on each side of your bag. 
[02:24:00]  Vast Deference sounds like a great name for somebody.  Like a fucking action hero.  I'm Vast Deference.  It sounds like something your lawyer would claim in court.  Vast Deference.  Your Honor.  It's obviously a case of...  It's a writ of Vast Deference.  They just cut the wires in there, right?  And then seal the ends, and that's it?  Yeah.  They don't really put it back together after that, do they?  I wouldn't look down.  I didn't want any part of it.  No.  But then I'd look at Renee, who's in the room with me, and then she'd look down, and you'd 
[02:24:30]  see the look on her face recoil.  I'd go, oh, don't do that, honey.  Don't make that face.  Is there a big scar?  No.  No.  I don't think you could find a scar.  Is it under your bag?  No, it's under the sides.  Of your cock or your scrotum?  No, your bag.  Right where your bag meets your, like, dick, go down a little bit.  Sure.  Reach into your pants.  Yeah, let's all reach in.  Feel some of those cords that are attached to your balls?  It's one of those...  Let's all get onion fingers.  And then they slice it, and they take this little hooked probe thing, and they pull that 
[02:25:00]  white tube out.  And it looks like a one, man.  Yeah, and then they snip on either side of the probe, and then they take a thing and  cauterize it.  Pss, pss.  Ah.  And then they sew that fucker back up, and the pipeline...  Oh, God, dude, it looks like chicken.  But wait a minute.  Motherfucker.  But wait a minute.  Sam, take that off.  When they do that...  Get the fuck out of here.  When they do that...  You can get it fixed, too, right?  You can go back.  It's hard to reverse.  It is revert.  Yeah, reversible. 
[02:25:30]  Anything reversible is like it might or might not work.  It's hard to reverse?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I should get one.  If I want my cum, I'll just have them take it out and put it in a chick.  Yeah, man.  I guess you could do that, right?  Yeah, go in there and get some cum.  Go grab a good one.  How long was your fucking cock out of commission?  I think eight days.  Oof.  Did it ache?  How was your first load?  Yeah, I got what's called granulomas, where it's...  Ah!  What the hell is that?  They give you money on Thanksgiving.  5% of the people get it. 
[02:26:00]  Big ball bags?  I guess you continue to, like, weep juice in your bag.  Anyway, yeah.  Oh, shit.  My balls, my whole scrote swelled up, like, twice a size.  So what did they do?  Nothing they could do.  Just, uh...  Got a bunch of Mexican kids with a bat to try to...  Do they drain it?  No, no.  It went away on its own, but, uh...  You know, it was pretty...  You had to leak it out?  It was a...  I was...  I was showing it off.  I mean, it was that...  It was that impressive.  Ridiculously oversized.  Like a giant.  Yeah.  What's it called? 
[02:26:30]  The Hinden bag.  I call it...  Gramulosis?  Granulomas.  Oh, granulomas.  Ow.  That's a big ball.  I like the sound of that.  I gotta piss.  All right.  All right.  We'll go piss, then.  Let's do that.  People are really annoyed by the lights.  One guy just walked by, because now there's a lot of people here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One guy just fucking was...  Oh, we're completely annoyed.  We've completely annoyed everybody down there.  Yeah.  Run it with a vasectomy.  But we're going to get to see what your balls look like?  No, because what he's coming up with for granulomas is just like... 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  I gotta...  I'm trying to eat some soup here.  All right.  Maybe I have the wrong word.  I might have the wrong word.  You're thinking of Gran Torino.  Yeah, because I didn't have anything to look like that.  Guys...  I will find it.  Doug, what are we promoting as we go to break here?  Paul Provenza.  I'm on The Green Room on Thursday night.  I saw the highlight of that.  Who are you on with?  I'm with Attel and Janine Garofalo.  I was booked on that one, and they fucking canceled me. 
[02:27:30]  With Doug and Dave.  What?  They canceled me on that one.  Why?  I don't know.  Who knows?  But I mean, I was supposed to be on...  I remember...  What is it on?  You told me he was trying to get you.  No, he's not.  He's lying.  No, it's bullshit.  He's lying.  Well, no.  He called me.  He was...  He got me.  They canceled me.  Oh, boy.  What channel?  I have no idea.  But I've watched it for Doug.  Showtime?  Watch for Doug and Dave and Janine.  Yeah, they did a whole highlight on the show, and they featured you.  What the fuck happened there?  I can't wait to check it out.  And I did a Louie episode, too, when I was here last time. 
[02:28:00]  But I don't have a date.  Sometime in August.  It's called Eddie.  I just saw the latest episode of Louie.  Holy shit.  With him singing the Who song in the car.  Something we've all have fucking done.  Yeah.  They do the entire song of him.  And all the parts.  We've all done that.  Here's the solo.  Here's the little...  On the side.  Oh, my God.  It takes balls to do that.  That's what I was talking about with Winehouse.  All those other guys have died at 27.  I grew up knowing all their shit. 
[02:28:30]  Right.  Every...  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Every little nuance of the song.  Not necessarily stone, but beautiful.  The last episode of Louie was amazing.  Yeah.  It's a fun show.  Very good.  All right.  We'll continue with Doug Stanhope.  Stay there.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FU's.  Fuck you.  Hey, to my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend, and her new fucking boyfriend. 
[02:29:00]  Fuck you.  You can keep the goddamn pack.  Fuck you.  Hey, this is to the brilliant cocksmoker who decided to do a five-point turn in my brand-new driveway  and on our front lawn.  Thanks a lot.  That was a $6,000 driveway you just fucked up, asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This is Pack Rat the Trucker, and this FU goes out to the state of Missouri.  Fuck you.  I finally found the synthetic marijuana I can fucking smoke to pass a drug test. 
[02:29:30]  Then you want to make it fucking illegal.  Fuck you, Missourians.  Fuck you, Kansas.  Fuck you.  I want to send this FU out to the incompetent, affirmative action,  hire a piece of shit that was too fucking stupid to send a goddamn fact out to fuck up my unemployment.  Thanks a lot, you overeducated piece of motherfucking shit.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big FU to Bobo. 
[02:30:00]  I hate hearing you on the radio.  You make the hair stand up on the back of my neck and I cringe.  I hope you die in a fiery truck wreck.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  My students keep telling me to call you.  My name is Bill Tetley.  There's some radio jokes going on.  I'd just like to know why you keep mentioning my name.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony FU line. 
[02:30:30]  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  Welcome. 
[02:31:00]  Hi.  Got Doug Stanhope in studio.  Yes.  Good morning.  Hi, Doug.  And allegedly, Dice will be joining us soon, I guess.  Any info on that, Travis, who just came in the studio?  Still on with Howie?  All right.  Oh, my.  10 o'clock.  I get it.  We've got to stay late for Dice today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do that. 
[02:31:30]  But he's an old friend.  Huh?  He might be a little late, so we're going to have to stay late.  That's all right.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's fine.  I get a Louis C.K. story, if you want to.  Louis?  Sure.  Yeah.  Doug Stanhope, of course, in studio.  Yeah.  When I, he caught me up about doing his show, and he said, listen, have you done any acting  at all?  And I go, no, I suck at it.  I was just, yeah.  Nice and honest.  Yeah, I was very honest and upfront.  Yeah, I suck.  And he goes, well, I wrote this part with, you know, with you in mind. 
[02:32:00]  Uh, and it's, you know, it's a guy that's a, you know, loser, washed up shit bag, bag of  shit.  Oh, fuck.  Drunk.  So you wouldn't really be acting.  Like, it's just more like being yourself.  And it was really, you know, and I go, I'll try it, but I really, I really suck.  I mean, I can't act like myself when I'm just by myself.  I'm really that bad.  And he goes, well, I'll send you the script, and we'll read through it on Skype, which is  worse, because then you're looking at yourself suck.  Wow, that's brutal. 
[02:32:30]  Like, there's little boxes.  Yeah.  So I, so we, I, I, we went through it, and he goes, all right, you know, just do this  a little different, you know, focus on this, and just learn the, learn the piece, and  we'll do it again in a few days.  So I memorize the entire script, and it's the entire fucking episode is about this guy,  and I memorize everything, and then a week goes by, and I have no word, which I assumed,  yeah, I'm not getting this part, because I suck, and I'm going to suck, but you could  have called me and told me I'm not getting the part. 
[02:33:00]  So then I thought, fuck, I'm going on Stern.  I was coming into the city, and I've already memorized all these lines.  How funny would it be to just work all of this dialogue into a conversation, because  it is all stuff I'd say naturally that would come out of my mouth smoothly, and then that  way when he hires someone else to play this part, months later and it airs, it'll look  like he stole the entire fucking episode based on one of my Howard Stern appearances. 
[02:33:30]  And then when I, I was actually more, I was bummed out when I got the part, because that  would have been funnier.  Yeah.  And he did call me, and I got the part, and I'm like, God, I like my other idea better.  Wow, that would have fucked with some people.  Yeah, I asked him, I told him about it, and he said he would have laughed.  I heard this before.  What the?  Yeah, Louie's a...  Yeah, every little nuance, like, this town is a dumperoo, was one of the lines.  And I'm like, dumperoo?  Dumperoo.  But yeah, if I said that on Stern, they're like, how could you? 
[02:34:00]  It's too specific.  Down to the dumperoo, you stole this, Louie.  How are you spending your days in Arizona when you're doing nothing?  I'm wicked good at doing nothing.  Yeah?  I could do nothing so easily.  It is such a great thing to do.  I never feel remorseful.  Like, I know this shit I have to do, and that's what churns up my guts.  But at one point, I paid off my house, and I have no bills other than the regular monthly 
[02:34:30]  shit, and my girlfriend's on disability, and we sat down figuring out how little we would  have to do to live down there.  Like, my property tax, I think, is, like, 800 bucks a year.  Oh, my God.  And we sat down figuring out how little we could just sit around.  Do you just stand up every weekend or no?  No.  No.  Like, I'll be in London for a full month, and then when I come back, I'm just doing almost  all of the fall is, like, Thursday, Fridays. 
[02:35:00]  I'm not working on any Saturdays, because I don't want to miss football, and you end up  traveling on Sunday, you miss football.  So I'm just going to do, like, Wednesday, Thursdays, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Do you watch that much football?  Yeah.  What is your team?  Cardinals now, I guess.  We're in the hat, Jimmy.  Yeah, I was a Saints fan, and then they won the Super Bowl, so I like to find a new dog.  Oh, really?  You don't like that shit?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you're...  Super Bowl champs!  Yeah, and everyone's wearing the gear. 
[02:35:30]  So, yeah, I'm a Cardinals fan.  I like a lot of teams.  I put money on every game, even if it's 10, 20 bucks.  Oh, you got a little.  Yeah.  But not heavily.  I just...  But I like to have some kind of...  Makes it interesting.  You got red zone, so it's switching to every game.  Dude, how great is red zone?  Red zone is, yeah.  It's almost...  Oh, my God.  It's addicting.  It's like watching SportsCenter in...  Yeah.  Live.  Real time.  Yeah, in real time.  And a lot of these games you would never check out on your own, because I'm not that deep 
[02:36:00]  into football, but now it's like, that red zone.  Wow.  What a great invention.  Yeah.  We're going to get a second box, so we can have red zone on one TV, and then have one featured  game, because we have like 15 people over for football every week.  But the stupid cable system here in Manhattan, they don't believe in red zone still.  Really?  Fucking assholes.  You got a cable?  Fios.  Fios has it, right?  Fios has it.  Fios has it.  Fios has it.  Fios can't get red zone?  Time Warner doesn't have red zone.  You still have Time Warner, or you didn't get Fios yet?  No, no, yeah.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  What are you waiting for? 
[02:36:30]  I don't know.  Oh, you're going to be like...  Seems like too much work.  Oh, no.  It's just too much work.  What is it?  It just seems like too much work.  Fios is Verizon's cable.  I love it.  And it is so much...  The cable companies for years, and I know from Long Island, it was Cablevision, and all  you had was fucking Cablevision.  You couldn't go to another cable company.  So for years and years, that's what I had, and just took it.  Took their shit service, their fucking...  Their digitized versions of movies.  Yeah, oh, all these HD channels. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, yeah, let me watch a movie.  So, I was black and white shit girl to black and black with cubes on the fucking TV.  I'm looking at pixelated shit pictures.  My internet connection's molasses.  And then, someone's like, why don't you try Fios?  It's in your neighborhood.  I'm like...  And I did the same thing.  I'm like, I don't want to change fucking cable companies.  It seems like a pain in the ass.  I was like, dude, just fucking do it.  And I did.  I called them up.  They fucking came in.  And not the same fucking like... 
[02:37:30]  Like, so where do you want that?  What are you doing?  Like, I didn't have to answer one fucking question.  When people come over to Dewerky House,  I don't want to answer questions.  Where's this fucking...  Where's the Ipswich box?  And the fucking...  I don't know.  Find it.  So, he comes over to the fucking house.  They do everything.  And crystal clear picture.  No digitizing.  Fucking internet rules.  And the guide is so much more intuitive than the other guy. 
[02:38:00]  There's so many more options.  Pay-per-view shit.  HD channels.  I fucking could not imagine dealing with those cocksuckers at Cablevision anymore.  I'm happy with Time Warner.  Oh, no, you're not.  I'm satisfied.  No, you're not.  It gets big brother.  That's all I need.  Oh, brother.  I got rid of them.  I was so fucking happy.  Have you noticed the difference, Jimmy?  Yes.  And it was great.  And I love when they come to my house.  They fucking knock on your door now.  Hi, I'm Bob from Cablevision.  I just want to know, you know, we'd like to have you back as a customer. 
[02:38:30]  We're willing to give you six months free service.  And I tell him, I go, look, why would I...  I said, wouldn't I rather have a steak for like 20 bucks than shit for free?  I go, like, I don't like your service.  I like what I have now.  Why am I changing it for any price?  Yeah, the problem is you're never talking to the guy responsible for shit.  Oh, I know.  You know what, though? 
[02:39:00]  He'll go back and be like, God, our company sucks.  Everyone I go to says it sucks.  That's the goal, to get them to kill themselves.  Yes.  Right there on my front lawn.  I got a private pile right in the office place.  They haven't called me once time, Warner.  When you're gone, they forget you.  Oh, they forget about you?  Yeah, they're like the chick that you break up with.  And you're like, fuck this bitch.  And then all of a sudden, she finds a much better cock than yours, and you never hear  from her again.  That's it.  And you're like, ugh.  Which is every girl I've ever broken up with.  Time Warner still has some exclusive places in the city, though, where you can't get Fios. 
[02:39:30]  But Cablevision is really, like, getting fucked over.  And I don't care what they say.  They're like, oh, boy.  And they come to the door and try to bullshit you.  Well, let me tell you something.  We're working on something, and we'll have these fiber optic lines, and our boost is  faster than this.  It's like, really?  Where was all this great shit when I was fucking signed up with you guys?  Right.  Does everyone in the world basically have DVR now? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  It's just how Cable works.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Finally.  It's fucking great.  I remember having it and never knowing I had it.  It's so good to just fucking record shit.  Someone came over and paused my TV show, and I'm like, you can do that?  I never knew that was...  It is fucking great to just be able to pause TV.  If you have Wi-Fi, you're shit.  It ruins other TV for you, like when you go to hotels and shit now.  You can do it from your phone.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  No, no.  You can program your DVR from your phone.  I don't know if I can do it without a Wi-Fi connection.  I might need a Wi-Fi connection. 
[02:40:30]  But on your iPhone...  See if you can do it with my phone.  Oh, my God.  What do you have there?  What's your phone you got there?  What service is that?  Is that fucking Ma Bell?  That looks like a StarTac.  Right here it tells me I missed a call.  That's old school.  Yeah.  I think Dice is here.  There he is.  I can't just...  Sam, let me just go...  What's up, Dice?  He just walks me in.  That's what he does.  Oh, hi, buddy.  Mr. Dice.  What happened to you the other night?  Hey, Dice.  ONA.  Hey.  Doug Stanhope.  You know Dice?  This is Doug Stanhope.  How are you, sir? 
[02:41:00]  I should be special.  I loved it.  Oh, thank you very much.  When you were in front of that mirror type of thing?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No refunds, yeah.  Thank you.  I said thank you.  No, no, it was good.  How are you guys doing?  What's up?  Look at you.  Look at you.  I see you got a whole crew with you today.  Happy face.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Oh, my God.  Is it going for everybody in here?  Whatever you want.  You know what?  Yeah, we got the couch.  This is your world.  We got my wife with me.  We got my fiancee with me.  The couch is open.  Happy face with me.  Wait, you got a wife and a fiancee?  I heard you say that.  You have a wife and a fiancee? 
[02:41:30]  Uh, what?  Ex-fiance.  Because she don't know how to do the right thing.  How you doing?  Eleanor.  Hi, happy.  How you doing?  Jesus.  Eleanor, how are you?  It's been a while.  How you been?  What's up?  Good, good.  Happy face.  A lot of hugs and kisses going on.  We're all saying hello.  Look at this.  Oh, it's like a reunion, like a family reunion.  Everybody, how you doing?  Happy.  What's up, brother?  The O&H show.  It's been a while.  It's here. 
[02:42:00]  I don't remember.  He smokes again.  That's right.  Oh, that's right.  You're smoking again, man.  Yes.  I'm going through some stuff.  Well, remember you called us from the bathroom.  He was smoking that day.  Wow.  And we were like, what are you doing smoking again?  I had to blow the smoke out the window, or else I would have gotten in big trouble.  And you said your son said you might as well go back to the old dice.  What's your name?  You work here, Stan?  Doug, Stan.  I just need an ashtray.  No, no.  See?  Go get me an ashtray.  I'll get it.  I know.  I told him already.  I'm fucking.  It's called comedy, Eleanor.  Don't do it, stupid.  It's called comedy, bright eyes. 
[02:42:30]  It's not nice.  Pigeon brain.  You're a pigeon brain.  Oh, she got you.  Oh, she got you there.  Wow, she really got you.  This is why I'm not marrying her right now.  Yeah.  No.  You know what I mean?  I'm good.  I'm all set.  She's married, and I have her working like a dog on stage and single.  Shut up.  Uh-huh.  You used to go out with Eleanor.  I remember those days.  We were dead, you know, because of the pressure.  How do you work that out, though?  You're married, and you still are friends with an ex.  That's amazing.  I don't think anyone could do that.  This is what, you know, we were going through our little thing. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  And what happened was, when I made the transfer, you know, to the girls, you know, from, like,  you know, like handing over, giving her roses.  Roses, I had to give this guy roses, you hear?  I said, I really like you on the thief thing is Alexander Monday.  You know, so anyway, what happened was, because Eleanor had to teach Valerie how to make the 
[02:43:30]  chicken soup on Pesach.  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I see.  Remember that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they kept her around, because she had good chicken soup.  That's how they became friends.  I was there for, um...  Johnny, good to see you, guys.  It's good to see you, Dice.  I haven't seen Dice in a while.  When was the last time?  I'm enjoying the second-hand smoke, too.  Thank you.  Are you really?  Like, I've got such a spacious studio.  I haven't smelled second-hand smoke in a decade.  Yeah, I really haven't either.  I don't want to have another one.  I don't care.  You know what I mean?  That's fine.  No, but wait.  Eleanor's still around, because she knew how to make the soup. 
[02:44:00]  I appreciate it.  And for me to watch anybody special is a big deal, because I'm the greatest comic in the  world.  You were the catalyst that got me into stand-up comedy.  Well, I'm saying, if I thought you were terrible, I would have to tell you.  Yeah, you would.  So I'm really happy that you're as good as you are.  Thank you very much.  I mean, you kicked ass on that special.  When I was out, I did fraud telemarketing in the late 80s, early 90s.  And when you came out, I would do you around the office.  And my boss had a side project cover band. 
[02:44:30]  And he goes, hey, would you want to open for me?  No, I'm kidding around.  Go ahead.  Tell me.  No, no.  He asked me.  My boss asked if I wanted to open for him.  And I go, that's not my material.  Who is?  My boss, when I was a kid doing fraud telemarketing.  Who the fuck is this guy?  I know.  The point is, just knowing I could get a gig, that made me write my own material.  A guy running a clothing store thinks he's going to call me up and tell me who's going  to open for me.  I don't think you understood. 
[02:45:00]  You're looking for him.  Yeah.  Doug, this is as good as it's going to get.  Yeah.  I just want a cigarette now.  You know, Norton opened for me for years.  Yep.  And now he's a Megatron star like me.  Yeah.  You know that.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Of course.  Do you give him the respect he deserves?  Not until he gets on the Apprentice show like yourself.  What is that?  When Norton's at Celebrity Apprentice, then he'll get the respect that I give you.  He didn't really care about the Apprentice thing.  The Apprentice thing is, it's old news. 
[02:45:30]  Old news.  He's entourage.  He's entourage.  Entourage guy.  Oh, that's right.  Entourage guy.  Me and Donnie Trump.  If he would have brought bagels like I fucking told him to do.  You know what I mean?  You don't serve sushi 5.30 in the fucking morning.  I told this mother.  And it's not like he don't look like he eats bagels.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He's looking at it and give him a fucking smack.  You know what I mean?  Because when I show up, if I got to get up 5.30 in the morning to play on some game show  and jerk around with cupcakes and donuts, give me a fucking bagel. 
[02:46:00]  Dice needs a bagel in the morning.  You know what I mean?  That's just who I am.  Oh, yeah.  Norton knows.  I love candy.  I love Slurpees.  I love bagels.  You know what I mean?  That's me.  It looks big things.  That's my world.  Dice, how's the entourage thing?  How's the entourage thing?  That's got to be great.  Entourage is going to kick ass.  That's got to be great, right?  I mean, Norton saw a couple of the episodes.  Did you give him a report on it or not?  Yeah.  You were more in the second one and you were very funny.  The second one's when I become materialized.  It's when they introduced you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  In the first one, they just talk about me and they showed a cartoon. 
[02:46:30]  And, uh, but it's, you know what?  It's, you know, it's, it's, it's the most exciting thing.  I got the show.  It's like, did you meet Bruce Rubenstein?  No.  No, I'm right here.  How are you?  Hi, Bruce.  Hello there, Bruce.  Let me explain who Bruce is, okay?  This is, this is a crazy story because when, you know, last summer I went nuts with gambling  again.  Oh, shit.  Because I had no fucking money to pay my bills.  Okay.  So what you figured, you'd parlay it?  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  And I did.  Oh, okay.  Until I lost it all.  Yeah.  That's called gambling.  No.  I know it.  About how much.  He's really smart.  You can say.  I'm acquainted with that.  The truth.  A million.  What?  I got close to a million dollars, right?  You lost a mill?  And we bought, no, I started with eight grand.  You turned eight into a mill?  Yeah.  Wow.  And Norton knows I could do those things, you know.  But with gambling, like, you know, it's not like being on stage, you do a show and get  paid.  You know, with gambling, if you get caught in that trap, you could lose hundreds of thousands  in a few minutes. 
[02:47:30]  And I made sure that happened.  Because I didn't want to just take all that money.  You know what I mean?  No, no, no.  But I bought, like, four cars that summer.  You know, we bought, paid some bills.  You know, I did a lot with the money before.  You were responsible with it.  That's good.  Yeah.  And then I gave them the rest back.  I just wanted to show them, I do the fucking.  Yeah.  You understand?  Yeah.  And then give it back to them and go, I do the fucking.  And just remember, I could come back and take it right back again.  And they know that.  And they know it now.  But it was like living the movie Hangover. 
[02:48:00]  But I actually did it because, you know, the gigs I was doing just wasn't, you know, I wasn't  making enough to really pay my bills.  Yeah.  Okay?  So I come back from Vegas after the summer.  And I go, you know Max, who's doing stand-up now, you know?  He just got signed with AKA.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yesterday.  And he's like a sort of an edgier Seinfeld.  That's like my son Max's style.  But what's AKA?  Agency?  It's an agency.  He's very excited that he, you know, got signed with an agency.  So anyway, I go to Starbuck. 
[02:48:30]  I tell Valerie, my wife, not the fiancee.  Right.  I tell Valerie.  I think they're on to it.  Oh, shit.  Am I talking now?  Oh, shit.  I'm just saying.  Do you want to sleep in the street tonight?  Anyway.  So what happens is I come back and I go to Starbuck and Bruce comes walking up, who I  haven't seen like in 14 years.  Now, Bruce's history is he worked with Mickey Rourke for like, how many years?  15 or 20? 
[02:49:00]  Too many to count.  That's right.  For like 15 years.  He wrote the movie Bullet that Mickey did with Tupac.  And so we're sitting there like the next day and he's playing with his fucking phone.  You know how everybody plays with the fucking phone.  Oh, it's fucking nonstop.  You know, and I'm actually getting mad and he's like asking me questions.  He's going, nice.  Last time I saw you, you were you were it.  And then you disappeared.  And as you guys already know the story, you know, when I went through the divorce, I, you 
[02:49:30]  know, I brought up my boys, my sons.  That's it.  I don't give a fuck about Korea.  So Bruce goes, why didn't you ever do like at least Entourage, a lot of comics that do  walk ons.  I go, it just never fucking happened.  And he goes, all I could tell you is Doug Allen thinks you're the greatest comic in the  world and wants a meeting with you today.  And I go, how do you know?  He goes, because I'm emailing with him right now.  Now, you also got to understand that Bruce at that time was doing construction.  And he's going, no, he goes, guys, I got to get back to the site.  We got to dig this fucking trench and we're going to have the meeting tomorrow. 
[02:50:00]  It's a true story.  So I have the meeting with Doug Allen and, you know, and it went well.  And I figured, all right, maybe if he gives me a walk on, that would be cool.  But then we start having meetings and Bruce don't even know about this.  So I call Bruce.  I say, you got to come over.  I got to talk to you.  I go, this, I think this is bigger than what you were talking about.  And then it wound up what it's now going to, what you're going to see through a bunch of  the episodes.  And Bruce became my manager.  We're reading the Gotti script now that we were in touch with Barry Levinson. 
[02:50:30]  And, you know, and going back into concert, I'm going to do Cyclone Stadium October 1st.  That people could call, what's, they said it was easy to call that.  DysonBrooklyn.com.  People call now DysonBrooklyn.  It's real hard, DysonBrooklyn.  And the password is?  DICE.  The password is what?  Oh, he got it right.  All right.  So DysonBrooklyn.com.  They kept it easy.  Password is DICE.  He's still kidding.  Well, no, because I forgot it yesterday.  I did, uh, the fuck, uh, Behar show. 
[02:51:00]  Joy Behar.  Oh, Joy Behar, yeah.  Yeah, uh, uh, I, I love her, but she's real mocky.  You know what I mean?  I'm a fucking mocky with the, you know, the minute she heard my wife's 27, you know, their  assholes pucker up.  You know how these chicks are.  They call her like, I'm not good enough for you.  And I told her, you look fucking hot.  What should I do?  Bang her on the desk over there?  You know what I mean?  I got two chicks waiting for me in the waiting room.  I'm not waiting.  Yeah, everybody's waiting.  Anyway, so, so that's what's going on, you know? 
[02:51:30]  Holy shit.  So that's how the whole thing happened.  It's pretty amazing.  It is pretty amazing.  Good for you.  Why is it so quiet in here?  We're listening.  We're good listeners.  We're listening to DICE.  But, but that's, that's the story.  And it's pretty exciting.  Cause, you know, you know, you guys, last time I did the garden, you guys are the ones  that made the garden.  Oh, that was blessed.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's, uh, unbelievable.  That was, like it said, that's the one Norton did with me.  Legendary.  Yeah.  It was very legendary.  It was huge.  And I remember even calling Dennis when, uh, it was so funny that, uh, when, when I had 
[02:52:00]  an album come out around that time and after the first day, Dennis is on the phone with  me going, so what do you think the move is, man?  And I go, uh, I want you to book the garden.  And he goes, uh, the garden?  Last time you did Westbury, you did half the house.  And I'm going, I'm telling you, it's time for the garden.  I've been doing this Opie and Anthony show.  And he goes, so you think you're going to sell the garden from being on a radio show  a couple of times?  I'm going, he goes, what about the beacon? 
[02:52:30]  I go, well, you remember this?  Well, I go, we'll sell the beacon in 20 minutes.  And how long did it take?  Do you remember?  I remember it was, uh, 18 minutes.  No, 35.  Don't lie to me.  Oh, wow.  I love you.  You lie.  Oh, boy.  It was 35 minutes.  My watch was broken.  Didn't you do the beacon theater?  It was weird.  If you remember, it was the last night.  A week later or something.  Yeah.  Of the World Series.  This was 19, uh.  That's right.  No, 2000.  Yankees.  Subway Series on top of it.  2026.  Mets and Yankees in the World Series.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  The Subway Series, Subway Series last night, we did 13,000 people. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Game five.  Game five.  Game five.  Game five.  Yeah.  No one was phenomenal that night.  Because he never did, like, something like that.  Like, he couldn't even believe him playing the garden.  That was about, what, 10 years ago now?  That's 2000, 2000, 11 years ago.  Wow.  Wow, yeah.  And now, you know.  How's Eleanor doing?  Back into stadiums, arenas, the whole thing.  Oh, that's good.  Thanks, Matt.  Yeah.  It's exciting again.  Good.  Good for you.  I won't have to gamble anymore.  I'm just curious about all these relationships on the couch.  You got the Eleanor, you got the wife.  It's very strange.  Well, Eleanor, you know, Eleanor. 
[02:53:30]  I'm not doing that comic, but Eleanor is, and I back this up, the strongest female stand-up  in the country.  Is she doing some time on your gigs?  Yeah.  She opens the shows.  All right.  Oh, no.  No, I'm just telling you.  Say something.  I am saying.  I'm letting you say something.  But you can talk.  That's the whole idea of radio.  I'm listening to you.  They're not seeing you.  I don't.  I didn't say they see me.  If you don't talk, they don't know anything.  Don't start in front of all these people like a fucking idiot.  Eleanor, if you want to switch seats, I'm fine with that.  Yeah, let me sit here for a minute. 
[02:54:00]  Let me sit over here for a minute.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  We'll leave my little conchiped over here, my wife.  Eleanor will sit down.  Eleanor looks good.  Thank you.  Hi, Eleanor.  She just pulled up her shirt to let us see everything.  That was nice.  Valerie, let her stand up.  I feel like an idiot.  I look like a boy standing next door.  Not just because I'm titless.  I'm just saying.  Stop.  Don't call yourself titless.  We wore a poor prostit.  We got something going on there.  A little bit.  Maybe some cutlets in there to build it up a bit.  Jesus Christ.  I know this word. 
[02:54:30]  You know what I mean?  I understand this.  Who says that about themselves?  Titless?  No.  See how funny that is?  No one should say that.  She's an open, honest person.  No one should say what?  You say like I'm tit free.  Tit free.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  What do you got?  Small B's?  Small B's probably?  I wouldn't go B.  Not even B?  Yeah.  Oh, that means you got cutlets in there for sure.  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  Really?  It's like build a tit every time I go out.  You haven't seen the breast cutlets yet?  What are those?  Meat cutlets.  The cups.  That's a good line.  Cushy cups that go on the knees.  I take my gag and I stick it right in the middle of a meat cutlet. 
[02:55:00]  And then I unload it in her jerk pit.  You see what I mean?  You got to get creative in bed these days.  Of course.  Yeah, these days.  You know what I mean?  Like he hasn't been creative about it forever.  Well, you know what it is?  You know, I get bored with the old standard words.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  You got to come up with some creative.  Like, honey, I love you.  I want to stick my fucking brick in your meat pocket.  Right, right, right.  You know what I mean?  That's romance today. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Today.  I mean, years ago when I say, you know, lines like, you know, these chicks walk around with  the dresses or treat me like the pig that I am, they get all mad.  Today, if you go out with a chick, if you don't come all over on the first  date, she thinks you don't like her.  That works.  You know what I mean?  Times have changed, guys.  They really have.  Today, I call them pigs.  They're high-fiving each other.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Dressed in animal prints and acting like animals.  I waited for this generation.  You understand?  What's going on with you? 
[02:56:00]  He's married now.  He's married a while now.  You're still, you're banging newscasters still?  Oh, wow.  No, no.  Oh, you're waiting.  That's a couple summers ago.  You're a couple of, yeah.  You're two summers behind.  You're a clean cut now.  Two summers ago.  It's like a whole thing with you.  Yeah, yeah, you know?  It's like the new improved version, ain't it?  I tried.  You know, I was like, let me, you know, take care of myself a little bit.  And then, uh, I'm not married.  What are you doing?  It's a tough question.  I'm going out with a girl.  You're going out with a girl?  You're bombarding her?  That's what I do. 
[02:56:30]  I go out with a girl.  You know, do you yell incoming when you're about to blow?  Uh, yeah.  I think she knows.  They get a kick out of that.  You get a little chuckle, and then you blow like two balls full.  I don't think I yelled incoming.  You know what I mean?  Remember, always build the load.  You know what I mean?  We all got to remember that one.  You don't jerk off.  This isn't high school.  I'm just going to call that the Saving Private Ryan.  I'm going to bang it like that.  Never mind.  Yeah.  You know about building the load?  Yeah, we have build the load.  It's called edging.  Edging. 
[02:57:00]  Jimmy taught us about edging.  You know, you jerk off before you even get out of bed.  That's all.  You don't do that when you get older.  You nurture it.  You build it.  You know what I mean?  You treat your cock with a little more respect these days.  I'll admit, you wake up, he might be at a tension.  He might be crying a little.  You know what I mean?  A little fluid like we talk about.  With due to day, you pinch the helmet.  You build the load.  Drive in your SUV.  Look at little slobs.  One leg up on the chair.  You know how women drive like they're on a couch?  You know, with the one leg up to show to the, as you say, the meat flappers. 
[02:57:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  I love that.  I got to give you credit.  Every time I say it on stage, I'm going to go,  Opie says they're meat flaps.  Meat flaps.  You know what I mean?  That was mine again.  And then you give them two balls full.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Here comes lunch, honey.  You know what I mean?  Lunch.  You know, well, it depends what time of day.  Right, right.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  It could be dessert.  You know what I mean?  It could be.  Ginger your prime rib.  You filthy fucking animal.  Now go do the dishes.  You miss this, Eleanor?  I do.  You miss getting lunch from Dyson? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, just talking about it.  I'm getting excited.  I'm getting hungry.  Yeah, all right.  I'm starving.  When she's on stage, she's filthy.  She's being nasty.  She's the filthiest thing I know.  That's not true.  I'm not that filthy.  When you're on stage, you're not filthy?  Sometimes.  What do you talk about?  Every fucking ethnic group just cramming their fucking...  Whoa.  Oh, damn.  I crossed the line all of a sudden.  All right.  I don't let those ethnic groups in.  No?  Oh, you don't?  No, I keep them out.  You talk about Persians. 
[02:58:30]  You talk about all kinds of shit.  You've had sex with Persians?  No, I have not had sex with Persians.  Black?  I like how Opie asked the question and she thinks I am asking.  Black?  Black?  Then how do you know what they look like, then?  I'm kidding.  What?  Who?  The Persians, when you talk about them on stage.  Because they hit on me at the comedy store all the time, those creepy guys.  Do they?  Yeah.  What do they say?  The truth.  What do they say?  No, that guy, the crazy Bobby Persian.  You don't know him.  You don't hang out with the riffraff like I do.  What do they say?  Why do you want me to do the Persian guy?  Just say it.  Say it.  What does he say?  I can't even remember what he says. 
[02:59:00]  What does he say?  Why are you doing this to me?  You're putting me on the spot.  What does he say?  Answer the question.  I can't remember what he says.  Don't open your mouth to me when we're on the air.  I just did.  You just asked me to answer a question.  You have a certain image so you don't open your mouth.  Oh, I remember.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  What?  When I was going on stage, he asked me if I'd dance on the pole.  Oh, really?  Like, you know, they phlegm.  They spit at you when you're talking to me.  It's sickening.  And so I was like, no.  You know, and I went over to the emcee and I started, like, goofing around with him and  talking and laughing at him. 
[02:59:30]  And he walked over and he was so serious.  He was like, do you own her?  I'd like to purchase her.  And he, like, spit all over us.  Sorry, slap with him, but.  What did he say to you?  Go ahead.  Say it.  What did he say?  Because he likes to, he says things like he wants to go on a magic carpet ride.  Does that mean fuck?  No, I didn't know that a magic carpet ride was on his back because those people are disgusting.  It's sickening.  And you get hairballs hanging out with him.  Yeah, she's from Philly. 
[03:00:00]  She can handle the animals that perform.  She can handle herself.  South Philly.  Oh, yeah.  Do I got to plug my gigs on this one?  Yeah, I guess.  That would be nice.  DysonBrooklyn.com, password dice for the October 1st show in Brooklyn.  Also, Atlantic City this Saturday.  Tropicana.  Tropicana.  Oh, wow.  But the official star of the tour starts at Cyclone Stadium, October 1st.  That's Brooklyn.  What is it again I got to say to get tickets?  DysonBrooklyn.com.  All it is is your name and where you're from. 
[03:00:30]  How hard is it?  DysonBrooklyn.com, password dice.  And the password is dummy.  DysonBrooklyn.com.  No, not dummy.  Just dummy.  Dumb.  Is it dummy?  Don't confuse him.  It's not.  Now you're confusing the audience.  The password is dice.  I'm sorry.  The password is dice.  I'm not confusing the audience.  So, DysonMan.com.  Just him.  You get along with the wife and everything?  I love the wife.  DysonBrooklyn.com.  To be honest, I get along better with the wife than him.  DysonBrooklyn.com.  DysonBrooklyn.com.  I said it.  What's going on?  Thanks.  No, you didn't say that.  Thanks, Bruce.  Get him.  Wait, say it.  Let me hear you say it.  DysonBrooklyn.com. 
[03:01:00]  Where else is he?  DysonBrooklyn.com.  DysonBrooklyn.com.  What are you, a school teacher?  I mean, that's the word.  Dyson.  Not hard.  It's got a little bit of sarcasm in there.  It's a little bit.  All right.  It's done.  They're buying the tickets.  That's all.  Yeah, they're buying right now.  That's all.  We can see the numbers.  They're going up.  All of a sudden?  All of a sudden, she's clean cut.  She calls herself from a Philly street rat.  No, I don't say street rat.  I say hood rat.  I'm from a hood.  Are you from a hood?  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  A neighborhood.  Oh, a neighborhood.  Nothing that bad.  She's got like 25 brothers.  I got six brothers.  I was threatened with for five years.  Don't I know your brother?  I know your brother.  You know my brother Johnny?  My brother Johnny's the biggest opian animal.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I thought he was the biggest fan.  You know what he does?  Yeah, I like him.  My brother Johnny shows up at every one of your shows, and he'll be like, hey, remember  me?  I'm Eleanor's sister.  Yeah.  And you're like, yeah, whatever.  You want to book?  No, he's Eleanor's brother.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be a little odd.  Thank you for correcting me.  No, that's right.  If he said the other one, I'd probably date him.  I didn't know I was a girl.  I forgot. 
[03:02:00]  I keep forgetting.  I like him a lot.  I keep telling her to throw a pair of tits on, and then she'll feel better about herself.  I don't want to do it.  You know, they do that today.  You don't want to, as I said in the medical vernacular, throw a pair of tits on?  No.  No, but they do it in a way that don't hurt women today.  He's got it right.  They used to somehow go through the tit, now they go through the asshole, I think.  I think that's one way that you don't see any scars, right?  Less scarring?  Less scarring through the asshole.  Under the muscle.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, they really do it.  I know.  Of course you don't. 
[03:02:30]  We've seen enough of them over the years.  That's great.  She's not what we're talking about.  Oh, I'm going to go get a pair of tits.  No, I would love to, but I'm afraid of it.  Just make sure they don't take your nipples off.  Why are you afraid of it?  Because I would be the one that had a fucking nipple and the wrong size.  No, they don't do it that way anymore.  They don't cut out your nipples anymore.  They go under your underarm, I think.  No, that's what I'm saying.  They go through the asshole or something.  I've heard bellybutt's fine.  Fondling myself.  They could go through anything these days.  Through the armpits is a big one.  Under the armpits?  Yeah, under the arm is how a lot of them go. 
[03:03:00]  But if I went under, I would be sitting here knocking things over.  They go under the armpits.  They shove it in to where the tit pocket is.  They don't leave it in the armpits.  Yeah, that would be silly.  You know what I mean?  I miss Doug Stanhope.  What happened?  Big tits in the armpits.  You're right, Doug.  I'm on the TV sets.  You're good?  Yeah, I'm good.  I'm waiting to have something to throw in here over here.  All right, good.  You got plenty.  You look like crazy on your special.  It was like a whole different thing.  Yeah, and I haven't said anything since, though.  Not since.  Have you changed your way of performing? 
[03:03:30]  What's that?  Have you changed your way of performing?  No, no.  I just don't have anything to say right this second.  You're saying something right now.  No, it's good.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, he's good.  The last time I hung out with you at the store, I was wrestling.  Nothing.  It's like a bar from the 90s.  It's weird taking in secondhand smoke in this day and age.  I love smoking.  It was fun.  I love it.  You smoking weed now?  No. 
[03:04:00]  It's cigarettes.  All right, I was wondering.  Oh, that night I was a little buzzed, yeah.  Because you were a little buzzed.  In the bathroom.  Yeah, I had a little medical marijuana in me.  Yeah.  What, do you have a little lower back pain or something?  Yes.  Yeah.  My neck, my back, my asshole, and my crack.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah, no.  So I was in the VIP bathroom in my house.  Where else would you be?  With the glow-in-the-dark toilet and the blue light.  Really?  And blowing smoke out the window.  Or else I would get in big trouble, like from the kids. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You can't be doing that.  I don't need that.  You know what I mean?  Because you called, and you were pretty stoned from what we heard.  Was I really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you were calling pretty high.  I remember calling, because I was texting.  Four in the morning.  That's right.  You did text me, yeah.  It was good.  I liked it.  Didn't one of your sons tell you to start smoking the cigarettes again?  My wife, you know, you get married.  Oh.  You know, like before you get married, like everything's great.  Maybe the marijuana.  No, your wife, not the mouthy one here.  Yeah, no, my wife.  And then all of a sudden, you know, five in the morning, she's going to sleep.  And I'm like, I thought you were going to hang with me. 
[03:05:00]  You know, and she's going.  It's 5 a.m.  The sun is coming.  What do you mean, hanging?  And I'm like, you know, I want to hang out.  You know, I got to talk to somebody.  You know, so I called you guys.  You're out partying the kids.  You know.  See what you're doing, Dice?  Well, you got to have a good time.  You know, we had a crazy summer last year.  I told you the whole thing.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  What's going on with you?  We're all, uh.  With the, with the.  With the thing.  With the baby.  With the thing.  My baby's 14 months old.  Wow.  That's unreal.  Walking and talking.  Are you going to have more?  I'd like to, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  We're good with this one right now.  We'll see what happens.  Are you going to have more kids?  We don't know.  We talk about it.  Huh?  What does she say?  Uh.  Right now we're having so much fun.  That's right.  She's good.  She's good.  That's your way you're fucking up this age.  You know what?  She's got a point.  No, but that's why she's with me.  I mean, we understand each other, you know?  Yeah.  That's good.  So right now.  But it's not off the table completely.  I enjoy understanding.  No, it's not off the table completely. 
[03:06:00]  Gotcha.  You know, if we can have one argument where the house doesn't look where a bomb went off,  then maybe we'll have one.  When you're with a Latin chick.  Yeah, a lot of passion there.  A lot of passion in all different ways.  Oh, a lot of throwing stuff.  You know what I mean?  You get an argument, all I say is duck.  That's all I'm telling you.  And then all of a sudden it's in the street, the family's involved.  Oh, shit.  You know what I mean?  The kids are involved.  And then we go for dinner.  And then everything's patched up pretty quickly. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Like it never happened.  But it's fast and energetic.  Then it's like it never happened.  Is she able to get a word in, though, when you guys are arguing?  She usually takes my side.  I know how sweet she looks.  Yeah.  That's right.  When she takes my side.  You have no idea.  She'll take an ice pick for you.  She don't have an ice pick.  You know what I mean?  She's got weapons.  Because it's a doomsday.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, over some plates are flying at you, you know.  You know, and then it's like, all right, forget about it.  Let's go get something to eat.  Yeah, what were we even arguing about?  Yeah.  Exactly.  And do you want to know something? 
[03:07:00]  We've had certain fights that by the end of the fight, I go, what was the fight actually  about?  You know?  And I forget what they were about.  It was probably your fault.  Yeah.  Probably.  I would assume so.  Definitely.  We would have to assume it's your fault.  I'm high, strong, you know, that kind of thing.  No.  How's happy face?  Maybe we should live together.  Move in and be a black face.  How's happy face?  He looks like he smokes a lot of pot or something.  Doing good.  Doing good.  Last time we saw you, you had no hair.  Now it's really long.  It's been that long?  No, you had hair last time.  He had long hair last time.  Happy looked his way last time.  Happy face still looks like a problem, though. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking of you recently.  It's always going to be a problem.  It's going to be a problem.  That's true.  Really?  It makes more of a problem.  Get me out of this fucking karate school.  I can't teach another lesson today.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  The kids are getting...  Yeah, yeah.  What's the name of your karate school, by the way?  Mo Andrews Martial Arts Center.  Where is it?  Suffering, New York.  I'm in Rockland County.  Yeah, you're allowed to say those things.  Oh, yeah.  That's why you go on radio.  Yeah, he can kick ass.  You know what I mean?  He's like a maniac.  I mean, he's changed a lot over the years.  Why do they name that town Suffering? 
[03:08:00]  What a dumb name for a town.  You know what I mean?  I know that's a hack thing.  You look at things differently when you get older.  It's really stupid.  Now it's a happy face.  When you talk now.  I mean, even when you talk over here, Mike the murderer.  Come on, stop!  I can hear you.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened?  No, because...  By the way, that's the happy face soul.  That right there.  The rage.  No, because we had to change the name.  Because when they were called...  Wait, wait, wait.  Why is this even an issue?  Can't we talk about your shows?  We are talking about it.  I'm on entourage.  Look, I'll leave the studio. 
[03:08:30]  I'll go back to Rockland County.  I don't need the fucking bullshit from you.  Calm down.  I haven't seen you in how long?  I come back.  I can't wait to see you.  I'm here.  And you start.  I was just making a point with you.  Don't make a fucking point about me.  Talk about your show.  Don't talk about me.  Why don't you talk about the show you're doing this Saturday?  You see what I mean?  Casey, why are you talking about Coney Island?  Don't start with me.  All right?  You're supposed to be watching my back.  Don't fucking start with me.  And you're getting angry at me because it's an old nickname.  You know what I mean? 
[03:09:00]  Just please.  Okay.  All right.  Calm down.  Just don't call Mike tomorrow.  Just stop with the fucking name.  You know, I don't like that.  All right.  All the fucking time, you fucking bring it up.  All right.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  And this is the man watching my back.  Scream out.  This is the man watching my back.  Holding the scream out.  Let Bruce do it.  Let fucking Bruce be the babysitter.  Bruce doesn't get like that.  Let Bruce be the babysitter.  What do you mean by babysitter?  Babysitter.  You don't know by now?  It's been a while.  You don't know by now? 
[03:09:30]  We have to change him and things like that.  Yeah.  You gotta change him.  Really?  You gotta change his diaper.  Are you an adult baby?  What did I do?  What did I do?  I got a baby powder.  What did I do?  I'm so happy.  Nothing.  Just nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Hey, why do they call you happy face?  You don't seem very happy.  No, he is.  He just doesn't.  I won't say it.  This is him happy.  You see what he does?  He's scaring me.  He's scaring me.  Oh, wait.  He might be like, you know when a big, huge guy you call tiny.  Right, right.  He was a pretty much guy.  I finally figured out after all these years.  You call a short guy stretch. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  I won't say it again.  But he don't look happy.  He is happy.  He's not very happy.  He's a happy guy.  You met me this morning.  How did it go?  We sure can.  Hey, how are you?  What's going on?  Now you're scared.  Calm yourself down.  Happy face.  You said you have to babysit dice.  What are some of the chores?  What are some of the chores?  What aren't the chores?  You know what teabag is?  It's okay.  Of course, I like teabag.  For instance.  I'll admit it.  For instance.  I like candy.  That's my job.  I like gum.  Teabag.  It's 5 a.m. in the morning. 
[03:10:30]  You've been up since 5 a.m. three days ago and have not slept.  You've had a fucking tic-tac for fucking three meals three times a day and it's, why don't  you hang out with me?  Can't we talk?  I've been up fucking 72 hours with you.  I've eaten fucking nothing.  You won't let me drink water.  And yet you still want to fucking talk.  What are we talking?  What's that a fucking talk about?  What happened?  No, but let's say I'm sitting there and having like a little morning treat.  Like, you know, like a little broken chocolate. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I know.  The bagel butter.  The bagel butter.  The bagel fucking rocks out of his pocket that he fucking stole from the candy store down  the street and the fucking guy behind him.  You're still stealing stuff.  Why is he still stealing stuff?  7-Eleven is his favorite restaurant.  I thought he got over that.  No, I never get over stealing because, you know, especially like in 7-Eleven.  It's the slogan.  Thank heaven it's 7-Eleven because I look at it like everything's free.  You know what I mean? 
[03:11:30]  You're just going there to steal.  There's no reason to.  I'm not waiting on a line for assholes that want to pay for lottery tickets that they're  never going to win.  Right.  You know, and if terrorist Tony wants me to pay, he should have another line.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you don't want to sit by a lot of tickets.  Don't even get on a line.  Just go in, get what you need and come back to the car.  I got it running.  They're not going to chase you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, they're not going to run.  There's nothing like, there are certain things in the world that you should be able to just  take.  Let's say you go to Macy's and you're shopping for pants.  Yeah.  The underwear should be free. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, if you buy the pants or?  Yeah, exactly.  Like, why pay for underwear?  Do you need the box?  You know what I mean?  Put on six pair.  Walk out.  You know?  Things like that.  Underwear is something you need.  You know, soap in the grocery store.  What, do they want everybody to stink?  They should give that shit away.  I'll pay for the milk.  Give me the soap.  Give me the shampoo.  I don't want to smell.  You're always looking for a bargain.  You're always looking.  You got to drill them down a little.  I've seen you in action. 
[03:12:30]  It's not a bargain.  It's amazing.  Did you see him steal?  Did you guys?  No, no.  He was in a store on 57th, like Fifth Avenue, around there, and he's treating the place like  it's a Bangladesh marketplace, trying to talk the guy down.  It's like the prices are set.  This isn't like fucking turkey.  This is why you're not as smart as me.  All right.  They raised the price because they know everybody's going to go, all right, but I'm paying cash. 
[03:13:00]  For sweatpants?  It's not like you're buying a ring of Tiffany for sweatpants when they should be 10.  I used to sell clothes.  You know how much they buy those sweatpants for?  A fucking dollar 25.  So you want to try to charge me fucking $40?  But you go over to Jersey.  I grew up in Brooklyn.  You go over to Jersey and you buy them for five bucks.  You're buying them on Fifth Avenue and trying to talk the guy down.  No, I used to steal faded glory jeans.  It's like Chinatown with a duck. 
[03:13:30]  No, look, what I would do, this is where I am a nice guy.  Yeah.  When I was younger, like in high school, remember faded glory?  Sure.  That brand?  All right.  So I'd buy one pair and I'd stuff another three in my pants and then sell them at school  the next day.  You were dealing pants in school?  Do you know why?  You didn't really miss the drug boat.  Because I wanted to get their name out there.  I was trying to help the company.  So I figured if I could sell three more of these pants, there's four people wearing faded glory.  Hopefully they're going to do better business so they won't mind if I'm taking a couple  pair. 
[03:14:00]  Did they know about this deal?  I can't get in touch with the head of the company.  I'm in high school.  I got to do what I got to do.  What do I got?  How can you get three pair of pants down your pants?  No, I would put them under a parka jacket.  Remember the parka jacket?  Oh, who could?  Yeah.  The snorkel jacket.  I'd do a lot of shit though with that.  Yeah, you got to know how to take things.  You don't just go, hey, I'm stealing this.  That's part of the fun.  And that's supposed to know.  The creativity behind it.  Let me tell you something.  Those alarms that they put on clothes today, you know where they're supposed to explode 
[03:14:30]  like a fucking bomb?  Bull fucking shit.  Every day goes by, I don't walk out with three fucking shirts and I know just how to  get them locks off.  You take your fucking boot, you bust it, no paint comes out.  Number one, how much paint are you going to get in this little fucking circle?  Get the fuck out of here.  You've seen this, Eleanor?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, he's done this before.  Look at her clothes.  Yesterday.  Well, I took a gift for her.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that was sweet. 
[03:15:00]  And my wife, the pants she wears, these glued on pants, I could take like 20 pairs of those  in a clip and I stuck them on my pockets.  Those are easy.  Me?  I don't give a fuck.  I bet those fit very easily in a pocket.  Yeah.  They really do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just saying, you know.  The best fucking discount excuse or question was trying to.  I would watch where you're going with that.  I was just saying.  Wait, what happened?  You pointed it out, Andrew.  That's not fair.  You made them look.  You just said. 
[03:15:30]  You made them look.  Because I looked at her pants when she came in.  Why?  No, Anthony, take it from me.  Because he's a person.  Because he's a human.  It's not a good place to go.  It was a.  No, listen, Anthony.  It was just a compliment.  This is a little lesson, really.  It was a compliment.  What kind of compliment?  A nice compliment.  That you're a lucky man that you have such a beautiful woman with you.  I'm going to back up.  No.  Tell me what happened.  Tell me what happened.  I got to put it in reverse?  What happened?  No, what happens is me and Bruce, we hang out at like Starbucks.  Yeah.  And smoke cigarette and drink coffee. 
[03:16:00]  So here comes Valerie.  She's going to the gym in these hot pink, like, you know, stretch pants with diamonds on  them, whatever they are.  The fake diamonds.  So she gets out of the car and he's going, oh, I like those pants.  No, I don't say nothing because she's there.  I got to be cool, right?  So now she leaves and I look at him and I go, why did you say that to her?  And he goes, about what?  And he goes, I go, the pants.  That's why they looked hot.  I go, what do you mean they looked hot?  I go, how would you like if I said to your wife? 
[03:16:30]  He's got, he's got a young wife, right?  I go, how'd you like if I say, oh, your pants look hot.  And he goes, I don't care if you stick your head up her ass.  What do I give a shit?  He goes, I don't talk to her half the time.  You know what I mean?  What are you, La Mata?  I can't.  You can't compliment her, your girl.  You got to have respect for another man's wife.  That is absolute respect.  It's not some fucking slob.  I'm sticking on the head of my dick and throwing around a window when I'm done.  No, it was strictly a respectful compliment.  I agree.  Don't I give you respect? 
[03:17:00]  Don't I give you love?  And look at him sitting there now looking.  Don't look even.  I don't like dick.  I can't even look.  I'm not looking.  I'm not stupid.  Now we all got to turn our heads.  Then the other night, like I told you, was with...  Give me the light.  No, then the other night...  I'll blind everybody.  You know, he worked with Mickey Rourke for years, so they're like best friends.  So we go off to his place.  Man, I didn't hear that.  And now fucking Mickey starts in.  You know, oh, come sit near me.  You know, and I'm like, why would she sit near you?  Number one, half of his arm was taped up. 
[03:17:30]  So I'm figuring, all right, if there was any chance to kick his ass, this would be it.  This is the time.  You know what I mean?  Because he could really fight.  Mickey's a tough guy.  You know, and I'm going, stop it.  He goes, oh, let me show you the upstairs.  Don't talk to her like that.  Don't fucking talk to her like that.  See, that's a little much.  You're right.  That's a little much.  We've got to go for that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Because me, I don't give a fuck.  But respectful compliments, though, Dice.  You know, offer her candy.  You're going to have to.  Offer her candy.  That's even creepier. 
[03:18:00]  What the hell is that about?  Yeah.  We like candy, though.  We like candy, though.  We like candy, though.  We like candy, though.  We like candy, though.  We like candy, though.  You want a sandwich or tuna sandwich or something like that?  But you know what?  That's the price you've got to pay when you're going out with a girl that's very attractive.  I'm not going out with a married girl.  I'm not going out with a married girl.  Nobody ever bothered you.  I'm not talking about you.  I'm married to her.  I'm not talking about you per se.  Nobody ever bothered you.  I'm not talking about everybody that goes out with an attractive girl.  It's the price you have to pay because, you know, guys are going to look and respectfully  say.  You know what, Valerie?  You're not even coming to the stadium show.  Can I say this? 
[03:18:30]  Because it's Brooklyn people and Brooklyn guys are maniacs.  DiceinBrooklyn.com, by the way.  And it's the code word is Dice.  But nobody ever bothered him.  That's what they tell me.  Nobody ever bothered him when we were together.  Really?  Yeah, he never had to get upset at all.  Why is that, Dice?  Oh, boy.  What happened with Eleanor?  That's why you guys broke up.  Because I was looking at all the other girls and she'd get mad.  What the fuck?  I don't get mad.  I'm not jealous.  Wait, no guys hit on you, Eleanor?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Not the way they hit on Valerie.  Like I told her, like, one eye is to look at other girls.  Yeah.  You know, because they walk by. 
[03:19:00]  They're all dressed up like in, you know, animal fucking prints with the fucking box lips.  Oh, that's nice.  But if there's some guy's girlfriend and you're talking disrespectful.  I'm not looking at the ones with guys.  I'm looking at ones that are just flying by.  Like the little fucking slobs that they are.  You know what I mean?  That's the new thing.  Oh, look at my box lips.  I love that.  You don't like that?  You don't like that when they show you that box lips?  I love that.  Why wouldn't I like that?  It's a new sensation.  I like that.  Look at my box lips. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, I like that.  He'll tell you.  He likes a thick box lip.  Yes, we know that about Jimmy.  You should package that.  Is it the same thing as a camel toe?  A box toe?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like the expression camel toe because I don't want to fuck a camel.  Right.  You know what I mean?  What about the toe?  I think it's even worse because I think it's a handjob from a camel.  Yeah.  It's even worse.  It's gross.  I don't go for animal sex.  You know what I mean?  No.  I like to be an animal when I have sex.  You know what I mean?  Because I'm good at that.  Occasional pig or two, right?  What do you mean?  Not literally. 
[03:20:00]  Figuratively.  He's a married man.  I don't cheat on my wife.  I'm talking about what I call the day, Dice.  The day.  Right?  Weren't you, you know.  Oh, in the day.  You'd get an occasional pig every so often.  Well, after Eleanor, I had a, you know, it was the domino effect.  Oh, yeah.  There was a lot after me.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a lot.  Sorry about that.  Are you jealous, Eleanor, that he's with somebody else?  Not at all.  No, certainly not.  Am I jealous?  She's relieved.  Do you look at it like you sold her a bad car and you're just happy she's not mad at you?  She didn't know how to get out of it.  She's relieved. 
[03:20:30]  That's all I can say.  That's insane, man.  You were just waiting for Dice to stop talking so you could tell him you're leaving.  Never happened.  Wait, what happened?  No way.  No.  No.  What happened?  Where's Kenny?  Did he say hi to Kenny Dice?  He's sitting out there.  Why is he coming in?  He was all excited on the way in today that you were showing up.  Kenny.  Kenny likes letting everyone else shine.  He doesn't want to be the center of attention.  Kenny, are you enjoying this?  We've been talking a lot, texting a lot.  I can never get him on the phone. 
[03:21:00]  I'm enamored that Eleanor and the legend here happy face.  Isn't it something seeing all of them together?  And you here.  I met the manager for the first time.  I remember when you were all kids.  You were all just wacky kids.  You know what, Kenny?  Can you send me this pic?  Did I tell you how much, Jeff, it was like looking at you?  The picture you sent me?  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  You know what I mean?  Is he tall?  Yeah, he's six foot. 
[03:21:30]  Wow.  Of course.  Coming out of him.  That's short, though.  Let's talk about the pink gorilla in Entourage.  Okay.  Oh.  The pink gorilla.  Who is it?  That's you, isn't it?  Red.  No, I'm the...  What am I?  An orangutan or something?  Orangutan.  Orangutan.  Yeah.  There's more coming next week.  It's not just the cartoon.  Of course.  All right.  You would never hurt a child, would you?  That's the speech I got from Kenny.  First, I was going to do Vegas the first time with you guys.  Wow.  We're in Florida. 
[03:22:00]  Holy shit.  We're in Florida, Kenny.  How would you think you would hurt a child?  No, I hadn't met the families yet, so Kenny takes me into a room in Florida, and he goes,  I got to ask you something.  I'm like, what?  He goes, you would never hurt a child, would you?  I'm like, no.  Creep.  I wouldn't.  And that didn't scare you?  That didn't deter you?  No, I went to dice.  I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with this guy?  Hi, Kenny.  That's a good one.  Yeah, and just standing right over him, looking right down.  Yes.  And he had the mustache back then.  He looks better now.  He had the mustache.  Very scary. 
[03:22:30]  The cop mustache, yeah.  I was like, no.  Wow.  Damn.  I don't know the size of the hands.  Why would you ask him that, Kenny?  He's just making sure.  Why would you ask him something like that?  He's very protective.  Yeah.  I love the walking back and forth.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, from the door to the mic.  Number one, Kenny, do yourself.  Why do you got to wear a jacket?  Did they make you wear the jacket?  This is corporate around here, yeah.  And at least it's a nice jacket.  Relax, come on now.  You should see the colors he wears.  Why are you going to make him sweat like that?  It's not us.  He likes crazy wear.  Take the jacket off.  Relax.  He doesn't know how to relax.  We all know that. 
[03:23:00]  You should actually have him in like a t-shirt.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, man.  Like a tracksuit.  You know what I mean?  It should be tracksuit Kenny.  I don't know.  I don't recognize him when he's traveling with Jimmy.  I was just telling my wife about the eight-round fight we had.  What city were we in?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, it was brutal.  Yeah.  We went to like a gym, but it was like an we want tour.  It was like eight in the morning.  So we got up and we said, ah, let's go work out.  And there's a boxing ring in the gym.  And Kenny's going, do you want to do a round? 
[03:23:30]  You know?  And I'm going, you know what, Kenny?  I could really fight.  You know what I mean?  He's going, oh, no, you can't.  You know, he'd egg me on.  Yeah.  Like the asshole I am.  So after the first round, we went eight rounds.  Oh, Jesus.  And I had to do like a giant concert that night.  And by the end of the eight rounds, we were both just like beaten to shit because we couldn't  hit in the head.  Yes, there's all body blows.  It was.  But, you know, when he hits you, it's like being hit by an actual car. 
[03:24:00]  You know what I mean?  You know, it was like brutal.  Like, and I'm thinking you're supposed to be protecting me and you're breaking my ribs.  You know?  Happy face is smiling over there.  Yeah.  You like that, right?  Happy face.  Well, that's what it does.  Happy teaches.  Yeah, I know.  He teaches the karate.  Does he still make you throw the saddle on?  Well, yeah.  What?  You mean the double pillow?  No, the double pillow saddle.  When he would wake up and his back would hurt because he was sore from sleeping. 
[03:24:30]  You know, poor sweetie.  Poor sweetie had to get hurt sleeping.  And he would wake up in Vegas and just go, happy Kenny, my back.  And they would both just put pillows on him and put the saddle on his back.  Yeah, we called it the saddle.  And they would have to massage his...  I don't want somebody's balls in me.  You know what I mean?  I'd be on the pillow with the elbow in the neck and Kenny would be on the side of the bed  like he's in the pew praying like this.  Yeah.  Tell me a story.  I wouldn't say tell me a story. 
[03:25:00]  I'm not five.  I'm not five.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just the neck though.  The elbow's got great sharp elbows though for neck rubbing.  Is that good?  Yeah, give Anthony a sample.  Nah.  You need a deep neck rub.  I don't like sharp elbows.  Does he need a deep neck rub?  No, my neck's great.  What's wrong?  No, I can't take deep.  You don't like deep neck rubs?  No.  Everything's breaking.  It's like cement though.  Yeah.  I like a little finger across the back of the balls.  That's what I like during the massage.  You feel that little hand up the leg.  That creepy little...  When you're giving one. 
[03:25:30]  Center profanity.  That's not profanity.  Balls.  Wow.  Little gentle nails.  Yeah, balls is nice.  Yeah.  That's a nice word.  Why are you afraid of profanity?  Yeah.  Well, we're doing a morning show.  People don't want to hear that.  That's the only reason they listen.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Your brother knows, right?  Yeah, my brother Johnny is...  He was the only one that was upset when Dice and I broke up.  My mother was thrilled.  Well, you know what?  Maybe if my guy in the world wasn't calling her phone, we would have went out for another 
[03:26:00]  few weeks or something.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  That's her.  Some accusations.  Look at her phone.  Every guy in the country...  Don't trust her.  Oh, Johnny Fernandez.  I have a lot of guy friends.  I have six brothers.  Guy friends.  And then what happened to Dice?  What happened if you looked at a girl?  I didn't sleep with every one of them.  I'm a man.  Yeah.  There was a problem.  You know what I mean?  Oh, just guy friends.  That makes a girl excited.  You are the CEO of the Double Standard Hotel.  You are sick.  Oh, shit. 
[03:26:30]  You will need help.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't you dare.  You're the sick one.  Don't you dare.  Like, she would go like this, like when she was working at the comedy store.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You set the smoke alarm off.  That's what you did.  That's you and your smoking.  Yeah, it's another fine.  This building has never had a cigarette lit in it.  I don't think there's a smoke detector anymore.  No, they're just fucking around.  They're testing it out.  You just set the alarm off.  Yeah, they're fucking around.  That's right.  No, now and then they do a test run.  So, um.  Are you a dirty texter?  I do sexting.  Do you?  Sometimes.  I don't like it. 
[03:27:00]  Sexting.  Because it's the young guys that like it.  I love it.  I'm old school.  I don't like it.  I'm into it.  That's fucking.  Sorry.  I like a good dirty text.  Do you really?  You like a good dirty text?  No, I don't mind that.  But, you know, you gotta get back to actual sex.  It's all on the computer, on your phone.  Right.  It's almost like when a guy goes, oh, you want to see a picture of my wife?  And they show it.  And I go, great.  Now let me see the one with a carrot sticking out of her ass.  Those are the pictures I want to see.  I do the text.  A lot of guys send those.  I wouldn't have it. 
[03:27:30]  Politicians.  I love a good dirty text.  Yeah.  So you prefer sexting over actual sex?  Yes.  Really?  Because.  Do you not like people?  No, but I'm saying sexting is great because after you're done, it's like you're done.  There's no.  There's no.  You mean you're actually.  Oh, that pesky.  The pesky human cossacks.  Yeah.  I send pictures of my dick and if they like it, great.  And if they don't.  Oh, like the wiener guy.  Yeah.  Like the wiener guy.  Yeah, like the wiener.  Just like that.  It's like nobody pays attention to their own life.  They watch what every other fucking person is doing. 
[03:28:00]  What do you think of wiener?  Who gives a fuck if he falls off a cliff?  I never heard of this guy until he was mailing his cock around town.  You know what I mean?  Who gives a fuck?  Not at all.  Asshole human beings in this world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think the computer thing is more stepped in as kind of a way to meet  people than just have sex.  By mailing your cock?  Yeah.  But you like to Skype.  You like to Skype.  Oh, are you Skyping guys?  Oh, you're a Skype guy.  Yeah.  I Skyped a couple times as.  The Skype man. 
[03:28:30]  It's investigation work I do.  Oh, it's investigation work.  Yeah, investigation work.  And all these chicks, they would all come on the same way, almost like bobblehead dolls  because they're nervous.  Yeah.  And they go, oh, this is so interesting.  Like they never did it before.  And they're like, I could see you.  I could see the room you're in.  I could see the plant on the desk.  I'm like, look, honey.  I got about 10 minutes before my wife kicks the fucking door in.  All right?  I got to come, wipe down the screen, shut the computer. 
[03:29:00]  I'll mail you the fucking plant, okay?  Get to some action.  Yeah, back up three feet and stick two fingers up your box.  Do me a favor.  Fucking filthy.  Yeah, filthy.  I had to put intermittent windshield wipers on my computer screens.  Got that bad, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There are fucking animals out there.  And then they wonder why I talk about them.  But it's such an easier way than you used to have to go out to bars and shit like that.  Now, online, you could sift through a lot of the riffraff. 
[03:29:30]  But this is what I'm saying.  And get right to, you know, the ones that are going to have a little fun.  Yeah, but do you want to meet them live ever?  Yeah, yeah.  Some of them were sure.  That was actually a girl I met.  Eh, not for a guy.  There was a couple of girls.  Maybe for the chick.  Is the show over?  Yeah, I know.  No, no.  Jimmy ran out, and then Opie ran after him.  Why?  I love a spat.  They miss each other.  We're on a radio show.  You guys love it.  This isn't like a real radio show anymore, Dice.  Isn't it?  What does that mean?  I hear the show's getting a lot bigger, actually.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:30:00]  Because we have...  It's a weird thing.  Because we don't give a shit anymore.  So the more we stop giving a shit, the more people listen.  Well, you've got a great audience, though.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  All those fat slobs that listen every day.  They're all fat.  I hate my audience.  What are you talking about?  I fucking hate them all.  Do you really?  Yeah.  They stink.  Fuck them all.  Is that how you get them to listen, by saying that?  Yeah.  I hate the fact. 
[03:30:30]  I've got to do fucking Cyclone Stadium.  Yes.  I hate everybody coming in.  Dice in Brooklyn.com?  Dice in Brooklyn.com.  Dice is the keyword.  Password dice.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, it's on sale right now.  It's easy.  Remember it.  You've got to say you hate them?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to say you hate them.  Well, you know what?  I will admit, there are nights just about every night where we've got to throw everybody  out of a show.  Everybody, right?  I'd rather perform alone.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Just do it yourself.  Actually, tonight I've got to do...  I'm doing some warm-up shows for... 
[03:31:00]  I've got to do the Tropicana this weekend in AC.  Oh, that's nice.  So I'm doing a couple shows at Rascal.  Not Rascal.  Governors.  Remember Rascals?  Oh, God.  You went way back.  You're going Governors in Leviton?  Yeah, I'll be at Governors in Leviton tonight and tomorrow.  No, no, no.  Wednesday and Thursday.  Oh, not tonight?  No, tonight's Tuesday.  Oh, Wednesday and Thursday.  That's kind of by my house.  But that's one of my favorite clubs.  Oh, will you come to the show?  Yeah, I'll come to the show.  Please come to the show.  I'll definitely come to the show.  Will you come to the show?  That's like two miles away from my house.  I thought you lived in Brooklyn.  You've been lying to me all these years?  Why?  No.  No, I'm over here now.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
[03:31:30]  I was over there.  I'm over here now.  I had to pee badly.  I couldn't wait.  And why do you have to go with you?  What is this?  People have to pee.  No, we're the small bladder club.  Yeah.  Oh, let me ask you something.  What happened?  Are you on the medicine?  Don't say a word, Anthony.  I ain't saying nothing.  Where does Anthony live?  What?  What state?  Like in New York.  Which city?  What city?  I'm so glad you said.  Berlin.  Or county.  Am I supposed to answer?  Yeah.  Nassau.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:32:00]  He's living in Brooklyn.  I saw him three days ago.  I used to live in Brooklyn.  He was a Brooklyn guy for a while.  I was in Bay Ridge for a while.  That was fun.  And you moved down.  Your ONA info is about 10 years old.  I want a pool.  I wanted everything.  You can't have a yard in Brooklyn?  No.  What?  You're going to have a fucking two by two foot yard with some other guinea next door going,  Anthony, can we come over?  I love Brooklyn.  Brooklyn's where I'm from.  Yeah.  I like Brooklyn.  It was fun.  I had a home in Brooklyn. 
[03:32:30]  Well, it was a Dice home, too.  It was probably very nice.  It was a nice home, but it was right off the street.  Yeah?  Did you have a pool?  I used to ride mini bikes with the kids in the street.  In the street.  That's great.  It was fun.  Did you have a yard?  Don't you believe in having fun?  I have so much fun, it comes out my ass.  What do you do on the island?  What do you do on the island?  Mow your lawn?  I have a great note.  Do you think he moves his lawn?  Actually, the Spanish people are over there right now.  It's like living out in fucking Jersey.  Doing my...  Well, they do.  They do my... 
[03:33:00]  The bugs give you bites bigger than fucking golf balls.  I like to kill it.  You do have to use some deep woods off.  Bugs ruin every fucking thing that ever happened in this world.  I think bugs are what caused the problem in the fucking Middle East.  I think you're right.  The bugs do suck.  This bug bit my wife.  If I found him, I fucking punched his fucking head through his fucking shoes.  Fucking cocksuck is what they are.  Think you're going to sting me and not pay the fuck?  You're a bee.  Okay.  Ouch.  Now you're fucking dead.  Yeah, that's what happens after you sting me. 
[03:33:30]  Rip that little fucking bee ass off.  Now, I need a nice yard, a pool.  I want to trap the fly in a room.  I want to trap the fucking fly.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What happened to him?  I got a fucking towel at the bottom of the fucking door.  I said, you wanted to keep me up all night?  You wanted to buzz in my fucking ear?  Now you've got a problem you can't fucking handle, my friend.  Now, none of you is kidding me.  You think that fly ever got out of the fucking room?  No.  No one else will talk to him, so he talks to the flies. 
[03:34:00]  He went by the window and just dropped dead over there, right?  Yeah.  An hour later, he's saying to the fly, could you rub my neck?  No.  My neck is sore.  Get the saddle.  That old lady was wearing a cask because I ripped the fucking wings off.  I can't.  Hey, if no one's around, do you talk to yourself, Dice?  Oh, yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't imagine Dice being very quiet for very long.  Yeah, I love to talk to myself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Try to figure shit out in your head and stuff.  Yeah, deal? 
[03:34:30]  I do.  I don't know if I talk to myself.  You're a little wacky like me in that way.  I talk to myself, for sure.  If I'm doing something, I'll talk to myself.  Something mechanical, if I'm trying to fix something, I'll be like, all right, no, that  bolt doesn't work.  Ah, fuck this thing.  Like that.  But I won't just sit there and go, well, Anthony, what should we watch today on television?  What do you think?  Can I do that to me?  You say you talk to yourself.  We kind of think you do.  We kind of talk about things.  Just talking to yourself and then just talking to yourself.  Like what store?  I'm going to rob that day.  You know, things like that.  That's right.  But it's petty stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the beauty of it. 
[03:35:00]  That's got nothing to do with money.  You never go for the big stuff.  It's always petty stuff, right?  It's the fucking thrill of it.  It's the thrill.  Who wants to shop?  Wait on a line.  How much?  No, it's the thrill.  You know what I mean?  It's more fun to go.  Can I help?  No, no.  I'll be back later.  It's so odd because most people get over that by like seven or eight years old.  Shoes are the easiest thing to steal because they always go, walk around, see how you're  feeling them.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're going to do this fucking shoot on the way out, all the freebies.  They do let you walk around the sidewalk.  I got to check him out outside. 
[03:35:30]  You're so right.  Go in the back.  Get me the next size, asshole head.  And then while he's in the back.  Great choice you made.  I love bullying salespeople.  Well, I've seen it.  I know.  When I ask them, like when you're looking, like I buy a lot of black t-shirts.  Yeah.  So I go, you got like double X in these?  And they go, well, I think everything we have is on the rack.  I go, yeah, but maybe you got some in the back.  I go, no, I'm pretty sure what we have is on the rack.  I go, yeah, well, you're pretty sure.  You know what I mean?  How do you know they didn't just bring a box in? 
[03:36:00]  Go in the back.  Get in the back of the store.  I don't even care if it's empty.  Get in the fucking back.  I bet, I bet there is the shit that they, that you need in the back.  What's that?  Of course.  I always assume that in the back there's the shit you need, but they're just not, they're  too lazy to go back there.  I went down to Orchard Street the other day.  Yeah?  We go to this leather jacket joint.  They got furs.  They got leathers.  Yeah.  I go downstairs.  I tell the guy I got to take a leak, right?  I'd unload my sword.  Jesus.  So I go downstairs. 
[03:36:30]  Think I didn't walk out with a leather?  You walked out on?  I actually came up wearing it.  The guy didn't even realize I'm wearing one of their leathers.  And I walk out, and Bruce and my wife are going, where'd you get that leather jacket?  I go, I took it.  It's a giveaway.  It's the stuff they're not using.  It's in the fucking basement.  It was a vest, actually, at summertime.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  That happened, Bruce.  Blue's not listening.  This jacket, this is, by the way, this is Jeff Hamilton.  This is my newest one. 
[03:37:00]  That's very nice, and it's sparkles.  Yeah, he's made all my great jackets.  It's for, like, Dice Rules.  That's the key Dice thing with the leather.  It has to sparkle.  Brooklyn.  Gorgeous.  Oh, shit.  Brooklyn on the back.  Dice on the collar.  Yeah, look at that.  BrooklynDice.com.  He really is the best.  How many leathers do you have, would you say?  I got hundreds, but he makes all, like, the big show jackets.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  The big one.  Dice Rules.  He's the best.  I mean, everybody, you know, would get, you know, their leathers from him, because I started  that trend.  How does it sparkle so much?  What's in there?  It's black diamonds. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Are they real?  This is real?  This is a $150,000 jacket.  Really?  No.  I'm lying.  Of course.  I lie a lot.  Of course not.  Anything I tell my wife, she goes, that's a lie.  All right.  Did I marry her?  Was that a lie?  No, you married.  How long have you been married now?  Oh, shit.  What, about a year and a half?  Oh, shit.  A year and a half already.  Wow.  I fucking love her.  I thought it was the sweetest thing in the world.  She really is.  She's a very nice girl.  I would say that she is, but I'm afraid now you're going to get fucked up. 
[03:38:00]  You're going to fucking insulted.  I'm going to fucking insulted for Pesach.  I haven't.  You're going to get insulted if I say she's nice.  With the Pesach that you came on?  It was, we had to sing the song, Passover.  I didn't know what Pesach was.  What song did you have to sing?  Work, work, work.  I don't know what it was.  Work, work, work.  Work, weird yarmulkes on.  I never went through that before.  I never did a Jewish holiday before.  Yeah, but it was fun.  It was fun.  We had a lot of it.  I had to read the words.  I didn't know the lyrics, but I mean, it was.  You know, that's when you heard the boys play.  That's a lot of stuff.  You know, they're doing different stuff now. 
[03:38:30]  You know what I mean?  The band thing is good, though.  You know?  The band thing is good, but you know what?  You don't force kids.  You know, I'm not fucking Joe Jackson that's going to make my kids.  Start whipping them with a switch.  Yeah, my son Dylan got into water polo.  It's his whole life.  He's like on two teams.  You know, his body's shredded.  You know what I mean?  The Jews don't get shredded.  Your wife just got up.  Are we allowed to look?  Are we allowed to look?  She got up.  All right, back out.  Back out the door.  Bruce, look at me. 
[03:39:00]  And where's Kenny?  Are we allowed to look, Dice?  Well, while he's looking that way, I'm going to look.  I'm going to turn to Sork, my friend.  What a fucking night last night.  What?  She's the fucking best.  I'm not looking.  We didn't look.  We weren't looking.  I was just watching my eye.  Wait, Kenny's walking, right?  Yeah, I don't like that.  It's Kenny.  Oh, man.  Andrew, it's Kenny.  I don't give a fuck who it is.  Valerie's not going to do anything.  How do I know?  I know.  You're all fucking hooers.  Oh, and you're such a gem.  No, but I'm a guy. 
[03:39:30]  Guys are allowed to do those.  Yeah, you're a pig.  I'm a pig.  Men are pigs.  And what are you?  What are you?  I'm a pig in a nicer way.  Yeah, sure you are.  Yeah, I'm not as open about it.  Sure you are.  The way you are.  I've never saw legs go back so far.  Andrew.  Look, he looked in.  From what I remember.  He's like, what the fuck?  You know what I mean?  From what I remember.  From what I remember.  I don't think Kenny.  Did you keep the videos?  So what is this?  Kenny's a gentleman.  Do you ever send dirty pictures to people?  Yeah.  You have?  It's hot, right?  No.  Come on.  You don't like it? 
[03:40:00]  I'm old school.  I like penetration.  Me too, but if someone's on the road.  I'm talking about real shit.  If someone's away, it's a replacement.  Well, if they're away, yeah.  You've got to see her perform, Anthony.  She's really the best.  I want you guys to come.  Norton was my best, bold, great comic.  No, he really was.  That's why he's on your show.  Yeah, yeah.  I knew the very first time he opened for me, I said, this guy's great.  And now he's even greater than the greatness he was then.  He's great.  He is.  He's a great comic. 
[03:40:30]  I even went when you threw in you out in L.A. with Florentine and you did the Viper.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  You came to the Viper.  And I can't watch a guy for like more than five minutes.  You know what I mean?  And he just bangs him.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  You know, I'll always say that about you.  You know that.  Thanks, man.  You know how we are about each other.  Yeah, yeah.  And as far as the female gender, the cockless ones.  Wow, you say it like we're not even people.  No, no.  I'm just fucking around.  But she's the best in the country, I'd have to say it. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah, and it was rough for her at the beginning.  Yeah, it was bad.  It was like her first week of comedy, and I decided I'd throw her out there anyway, see  what happens.  He thought that they would know me from the VH1 show.  A little vicious that nobody saw.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  A little vicious.  Oh, real bad.  You know my audience.  You know, they're animals.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But now she just kills them.  Westbury music.  What is it called?  Music Hall.  Oh, yeah.  Music Hall, yeah.  How come she's not back from the bathroom yet?  That takes a while.  Yeah, it's a long way.  How far is the bathroom? 
[03:41:30]  How many feet?  It's like right over there.  It's right there.  Nah, I'm kidding.  It's down the hallway.  You've got to make a right and then a left.  Kenny's probably taking the long walk on purpose just to get more talking time in.  Oh, yeah.  You know why I used to write a lot of this stuff for him.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, it's Hickory Dickory.  He's an unbelievable writer.  Hickory Dickory.  Really?  That was you?  That was me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Kenny was fired every three weeks.  Why am I getting fired?  Because you don't know how to talk to people. 
[03:42:00]  You know, he'd walk over to like a town coordinator like at the Hilton and go, go get him a pack of cigarettes or he's leaving.  Kenny, that's not what you say to the guy paying me.  You know what I mean?  I remember when we were at, where was that, Morton's?  And he almost smashed some fan in the face for coming up to dice.  Yeah.  Some guy was coming up and he goes, I just want to say I'm a big fan.  And Kenny jumped on this guy like he had a knife.  Just so I say something once an hour. 
[03:42:30]  When you were in Vegas, that's where I started Open Mic and I tried to go up to him in a casino and fucking apes.  I was going to try to give you a joke.  That's how brilliant my thinking was.  And I walked up to him.  I forget what casino it was, but it was after we saw you.  We like stalked you for an hour and then I tried to walk up to you at some lounge and apes were all over me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not apes.  Kenny.  Yeah.  He'll probably remember the incident too. 
[03:43:00]  That was the Riviera, December 3rd, 1992.  You had on blue shoes and your game was uncomfortable.  You know what's great with Kenny, the famous line, the famous line from Kenny.  Wow.  You know, because, you know, that's right.  You know, a detective, a gold shield detective.  Oh, yeah.  And there was one time we were in Reno and some fan was like getting into an audience.  And the guy was like, you know, he was a little guy.  And Kenny's like, well, if you feel froggy, jump. 
[03:43:30]  And I look at him and go, you're a cop.  Don't you have anything better than that?  Well, he didn't jump.  But it was funny.  Of course.  That's Kenny.  Yeah.  We all know.  Kenny's hilarious and he doesn't even know it.  That's true.  But he's taken an awful long time.  He really is.  A little too long.  Now I'm feeling a little uncomfortable.  We might have to end the show and check on Dice's wife.  Now I'm feeling a little uncomfortable that he's been away for this long with your wife. 
[03:44:00]  That's a little long, Dice.  Don't do that.  Don't see him.  He's over at the Fox.  She's over at the Fox.  No, don't get crazy with that.  Oh, no.  At the Fox with Jamie Foxx or something.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  That's the Shade 45.  Don't let her go over there in the Shade 45.  You don't want her in that studio, Dice.  That's the Black Station over there.  And you know.  You know how big it would be.  No, no, no, no.  You can't.  It's fine.  Dice is up.  Dice is up.  What are you doing?  Go to the Fox holds. 
[03:44:30]  Go to the Fox holds.  Go to the door.  Don't push it.  We locked you in, Dice.  You know what he's doing?  He's turning the knob and pushing, which ain't working.  And then he's turning the knob back to being locked and then pulling.  It's not opening.  Oh, there you go.  He's going to the Fox holds.  Is this all World Wrestling Federation?  It is real.  Every single moment is like this.  Every single moment.  This is every moment of every gig of every city.  She didn't even go to the bathroom.  What are you talking about?  She's out there talking to like four guys. 
[03:45:00]  Andrew, that's not true.  Get in here.  Take a look, stupid.  You're stupid, first of all.  You're supposed to be in this interview.  You're stupid.  Get in the goddamn interview.  I don't know why the engagement never worked.  I gotta go.  I gotta go to the doctor.  Why am I in the corner?  I sit in the corner.  No one puts Dice in the corner.  Fucking Eleanor.  All I do is try to help her and build her up.  Oh, it sounds like it.  She's going to be stupid.  What do we got?  Pig, horse, slut, meat curtains.  What have you called her so far?  You do try to build her up. 
[03:45:30]  Pig, jerk-off, asshole.  Look, let me tell you something.  When I call a girl pig, that means I think she's hot.  That's a compliment.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  You smell good.  Do you ever call...  You smell good.  Real good.  This is my cologne.  You know what the name of it is?  No.  Dice.  Dirty.  Let me smell it.  I'm not even kidding.  You know where you get it?  It smells good.  Yeah.  You know where you can steal it?  Lush.  I go there a lot.  Jimmy goes to Lush for the service.  I just want a big soap thing.  It was too greasy.  It left too much greasy residual on there. 
[03:46:00]  I didn't like it at all.  What was it called?  Italy?  No, no.  This stuff is no.  They got the fucking body.  Coach, can you put me back on third?  Yeah, yeah.  Get back on third.  Come on.  Doug Stanhope.  I like this.  He's been sitting behind the fucking television.  When did you do that special?  I thought he was gone for a little while.  That was 2007.  That was like your first one, right?  You just got replaced.  Sorry, Eleanor.  That's fine.  That's a good replacement.  Doug's a great replacement.  Sorry, Eleanor.  You both did great.  You got replaced.  You did Monster Rain.  Yes.  It's happened.  Monster Rain was better than yours, though. 
[03:46:30]  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  But it was a bigger audience.  Yeah.  Did you think it was better than yours?  Yeah, I thought it was better than yours.  Better than yours?  I didn't see Doug's.  That's not right.  No, his special was great, but his was better.  Yeah, no, it was fantastic.  He's Jim Norton.  He's Doug Stanhope.  I see a lot of comic specials, and I can't tell sometimes which one's funnier than the  other because they're so different.  You know?  But every comic has their own thing.  I watched Bill Burr's special, and I watched Patrice O'Neill's.  Bill Burr's pretty great, too.  They're hysterical. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but they're two different types of comics.  But they're really not different types of comics.  They're both just fucking rageful Boston creeps.  They really are.  You're absolutely right.  These Boston comics are fucking angry motherfuckers.  Well, look where they live.  The funniest, though.  That's true, yeah.  You know what I mean?  They're not funny.  Who the fuck lives in Boston?  They're all funny.  They're fucking angry motherfuckers.  Everybody that was rejected from Brooklyn ends up in Boston.  Do you know what I love, though?  I love when you're on the East Coast, and you meet people from the different boroughs, the  pride that comes out of them? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Like, we've been asking people that, you know, coming over to me, like, I go, where  are you from?  You know?  And they go, Bronx.  South fucking Bronx.  Jeez.  They're like, okay, is the Bronx even there anymore?  Is the South Bronx?  Well, it's really not there, but I got a little place I still live in over there.  You know?  But it's all that pride.  A lot of pride in all the boroughs and Brooklyn especially.  What are they going to say in L.A.?  Encino.  Go fuck yourself.  You know what I mean?  And there's no, like, ballsy names in L.A. 
[03:48:00]  No, it's a whole different attitude.  You know, I love L.A., and I love living there, but, you know, Brooklyn's my home, you  know?  You go to L.A., people wear hats that say Brooklyn on it.  Yeah.  Do they?  I do.  Yeah.  And I'm from Philly.  You're from Philly.  Philly?  I know, but I like the Brooklyn.  I love Philly, too, though.  With shirts with Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  New York.  My favorite sweatshirts.  You know, like, if you meet somebody from Philly, you have any of G-Nose.  No, Tony Luke's.  Yes.  Which one?  Tony Luke's.  I like Gino's.  I like Tony Luke's.  Do you?  Because I'm a real South Philly girl.  Who are you going with there?  It's not your business anymore.  What guy's calling with you there? 
[03:48:30]  It's not your business anymore.  Yeah, well, Gino's is the best.  Shut your face.  When I come to Philadelphia, I'm eating the Gino's.  I love Gino's, too.  Gino's is the best steak sandwiches.  Did shit go wrong when you two were together?  What?  Was it constant bickering?  Yeah.  Because she doesn't know that the man is the boss, and she should keep her mouth quiet.  That's nice.  It's fun to hang out with prehistoric animals.  With Ralph Cranberry.  I'm a prehistoric animal.  You are a prehistoric animal.  Because I understand how relationships work.  Well, that my dad thinks I'm on tour with Cassius Clay.  You know, they take a million workout classes, right? 
[03:49:00]  You know how they're always in combat school and, you know, boot camp.  Spinning.  And profanies.  Spinning.  And then the minute they get on top of you in 20 seconds, my leg is burning.  Get the fuck off.  Let me finish this.  I never said that.  It's always, yeah.  We always have a good one on your face.  Climbing on top and finishing up, right?  Here's another one.  And they actually request it.  You know, years ago, when I was like, bang, when I was like 16, 17, girls did go, do me 
[03:49:30]  a favor now.  Come on my face.  They would never.  All right.  Here you go.  They would never back that.  Here you go.  Would you kiss a girl after you blow a load of your mouth?  You know what?  No.  I'm going to have to say yes.  Ooh.  I'm kidding.  Oh, no.  I'm kind of weird on that.  I don't like that either.  I'm kidding.  No, my mother doesn't listen to this show.  My mother doesn't.  I'm dirty.  I'm like goofing about it like I would.  Jimmy's calling right now.  Just so she takes the fucking full load.  Yeah.  I wish I could do that.  I wish I had the fucking, the moral courage to fucking eat my load out of a pussy. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, if they try to kiss you, you got to grab their nose and mouth like a dog and rub  their neck to get the pill down.  That way they can't do anything with it.  That's gross.  You just got to, because who wants that shit around after it comes out of you?  Oh, that fucking horrible cum breath.  It's awful.  Metallic.  What happened?  Yeah, no, the story over here.  Sorry, but Chappelle.  Chappelle, what happened?  Apologizing for his bad attitude.  Check text.  Heckled crowd at gig. 
[03:50:30]  Sorry for bad attitude.  Oh, shit.  You know, what the fuck is going on?  The comics can't even, I was talking about this with, what's it, enjoy Bayhawk?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like I'm going, what the fuck is wrong with people today that a comic can't  go on stage and do that comedic act without having people go, oh, that's wrong.  Then what the fuck are you showing up for?  The whole idea of comedy is taking real fucking life and blowing it out of proportion to make 
[03:51:00]  people laugh.  It's a fucking asshole.  Everything you do.  Skewering it.  You know, like she was asking me about this J.P. Morgan, whatever the fuck his name is,  that, uh...  The Tracy, Tracy Morgan.  The gong show.  You know what, but the thing is, uh, Doug, the thing is, I don't really follow a lot  of comics.  All right.  You know, so I don't, I don't give a fuck what he said or what he did, but I did hear  that he apologized to the guy that he said was a fag, whatever.  Yeah.  And it's like, he's on stage doing a fucking act. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  And that shit...  You know, I, I, I went to a fucking living hell for telling fucking jokes.  Oh, yeah.  You know, and she was like, do you feel bad about that?  No, I don't fucking feel bad about it.  I remember that.  You know, why the fuck would I feel bad about shit I think is fucking funny?  And one thing I gotta say, I don't ever remember Dice apologizing when all that shit  went down.  You know, the show, the Arsenio thing, where I got a little choked up.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, where, where back then people were going, he apologized, he didn't.  No, no, no.  I wasn't apologizing.  You know, I got a little choked up because, you know, I'm, I'm a guy that really likes 
[03:52:00]  to accomplish shit.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, I accomplished becoming the biggest comic in the world.  I think that's a big accomplishment.  And my first big movie was coming out.  So I wanted to tell people like, you know what?  It's okay to have whatever dream it is and go after it.  And I got a little fucking choked up and she showed it last night.  And she even started in with that shit.  And I go, I apologize for nothing I've ever said.  No.  You know what I mean?  With, with the MTV stuff and the things with the. 
[03:52:30]  I made a choice and I did it.  SNL and things like that.  And it made me the biggest thing in the fucking world.  Motherfuckers.  Don't go to comedy shows then.  Exactly.  Live your fucking boring fucking lives.  Talk about everybody that said the wrong.  Chappelle's a great comic.  I never saw J.P. Morgan's act, but I'm sure he's a good comic.  Whatever the fuck his name is.  I couldn't give a fuck.  When people ask me about other comics, I go, you know what?  I don't even like fucking comedy.  I don't even like what I do. 
[03:53:00]  You don't like comedy.  No, I like to do what I fucking do.  I like to fucking outrage people.  I want people to walk out going, that was the funniest fucking show I've ever seen in my life.  The guy's out of his mind that they forget their fucking boring fucking lives living with some broken down fucking valise that hasn't fucked them in 12 years.  And here with a guy on stage, their age, going, that's all I do.  You're doing God's work.  If I'm not on this stage, my fucking dick is balls deep in my new fucking wife. 
[03:53:30]  And that's what we like to do.  That's awesome.  That sounds like a schoolhouse rock show.  That sounds like what?  That sounds wonderful.  That sounds like what?  Sounds like a schoolhouse rock show.  Why?  You're going to have a good time with me.  I had a blast with you.  Exactly.  I thought you were great.  You know, look at that.  Sometimes when I think about it, I throw up in my mouth a little bit, but it's fine.  You see what I mean?  You relived the load.  Dice in Brooklyn.com. 
[03:54:00]  She really is the greatest.  I go for her and everything, but she's...  That seems odd.  Like, how many exes do you actually hang out with?  Listen, my mom and dad are best friends.  You know what I mean?  They've been separated for years.  You know, my kids have, you know, a couple mothers at home.  Did you go through a time period where you guys couldn't talk to each other and it was like,  fuck you?  Not really.  No?  Are you jealous if she dates other guys?  No.  What do I give a fuck what she does?  Just don't bring her around me when you're mine.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He still refers to me as being in his stable, which is kind of creepy. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Isn't she?  She's here?  I would think she's here.  She sleeps in my room, doesn't she?  Well, we did have a pajama party last night.  Yeah, that's adorable.  Your wife doesn't get mad that she's in.  Shoot.  We have me and Valerie had a pillow fight, and he asked us to...  How do you pull this off?  Rub this off.  Because I'm dice.  Rub my neck.  Because I'm dice.  No, he goes, how do you pull this off?  Dice is a pimp.  I'm not Joe fucking schmoe over here.  I have the neck.  You know what I mean?  I'm dice.  Why isn't...  Shouldn't dice have more than one? 
[03:55:00]  Have you ever gotten a double massage?  From both of us.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Her mother, too.  Valerie's mother.  She's hot, too.  I normally got a picture of her on me.  She really is.  But I don't have my little satchel.  She walks on his back.  Yeah.  Her mother's like my age, actually.  You know what's so funny?  When I'm in the gym with my wife and her mother, people that come over to say hello,  they go, oh, your wife is so beautiful.  And her mother goes, oh, no, honey.  I'm not the wife.  That's his wife.  Oh, shit. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  It's like, no, it's not.  You know?  But her mother's beautiful.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And what's funny is my son, Dylan, is constantly in the mother's room getting his back rubbed.  Oh.  You know, then I got to come in there and go, Dylan, you should be going to bed.  You got school.  I got to get my massage now.  You know?  Not only that, but you got to watch the reality shows.  That's a little weird.  That's a little creepy.  That's a little creepy.  No, I'm not naked.  No, no.  I understand.  It's just a little creepy.  What's creepy?  A kid getting a massage. 
[03:56:00]  He's 17.  I know.  It's just a little creepy.  Well, I rub his back, too.  She rubs his back constantly.  Again, creepy.  I agree.  Well, Dylan always says about Eleanor that she's inappropriate with things.  I'm not inappropriate.  She's always showing her panties.  Oh, shit.  She's always pulling her panties out.  Nice.  And Dylan will say, Dad, isn't that inappropriate of her?  And I go, it is.  That's why I don't let her stay here anymore.  That's not true.  I stay there a lot.  Something will happen.  Do you wear sexy ones, or do you wear, like, pennies? 
[03:56:30]  Sexy ones.  Chicken cutlet?  Oh.  Pennies.  Or do you wear a tongue chick?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  She goes with the tongue.  Good.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I love a tongue.  It's a fake tongue.  We've invented the tongue.  I want to give them, like, $100.  You like that?  Oh, good.  $100.  What do you think about those little, like, boy short things that are-  I love the boy short.  Yeah, right.  They cut the hiney in half.  With the fucking cheeks sticking out.  Right, right.  You kiss the cheeks a little, you know, and then you start a little sniffing, a little  pinching in the box.  And then a little sniff.  Next thing you know, well, Jed's a millionaire. 
[03:57:00]  You know?  No, that's hilarious.  I do like that.  He's like, what's better than that?  Nothing.  Start whacking off.  The fucking sniffing.  He's hysterical.  I love it.  Oh, he loves the sniff.  Do the sniffing.  Do the sniff.  Make the face.  Wait, everybody quiet.  That's the nauseating part to me.  The face you make it.  He doesn't.  That's when you're rubbing the ass cheeks and you make it look like it was an accident  that you separated them.  Yeah, but why do you have to make a face?  An accident?  Nobody wants to know their assholes being sniffed. 
[03:57:30]  Or separated.  They feel creeped out by that.  Especially in the street.  Yeah, it is hard.  That's when you're rubbing the ass and what?  All of a sudden they go opposite directions and spread.  Yeah, and you just get your nose in there and you give a little sniff.  And you give a sniff.  That's nice.  What I love about the new generation.  I love you.  What I love about new generation.  And it's the truth.  You know, years ago they.  Look, women know what fucking animals they are.  They always have.  They're worse than any fucking guy. 
[03:58:00]  But years ago they tried to cover it up a little.  Like, I'm a nice girl.  You know, two hours later you're four feet deep in a rasshole, right?  You know, today they want you to know.  You know what I mean?  It's like they became the aggressors.  Yeah.  Where do you think that came from?  From my lessons to the country a hundred years ago.  Is it your influence?  Letting them know you could be the thing that you are.  Your teachings.  You know what I mean?  Someday it'll be a religion.  I just know it.  Hopefully. 
[03:58:30]  Are you doing anything of the Twitter?  What are you doing?  Electronic media.  My wife does Mrs. Dice Clay.  She does the Twittering for me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't believe in that.  You'd be good on it.  Well, it's true.  You know what?  No, but she does like.  I don't know how to like get to it.  But you figure it out.  It's hard.  I can't figure it out.  I'm still working on the text.  What kind of phone do you have?  I got Commando.  Do you have apps on your phone?  No, I don't.  He's got it all.  He's got it all.  He just doesn't know how to use it.  You should use it.  Wait, did I even take my fucking phone?  Twitter is easy.  Where is my phone? 
[03:59:00]  See, that just goes to show you.  He doesn't know if he even took his phone.  I leave the house without my phone.  I'm fucking panicked.  Wait, let me show you Commando.  Oh, yeah?  It's almost like forgetting your pants.  You just know.  Yeah.  That's like, oh shit, my whole day is shot.  I can't get in touch with anyone.  It's not the phone's fault.  It's the three-inch leather you wear.  Commando, watch this.  It could do anything.  Oh, wow.  It could go underwater up to 300 feet with this.  That looks like an old walkie-talkie I used to have.  Yeah, but who needs to do that?  You got a keypad?  His name's Zach Morris. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, that's...  Look at that.  That's Commando.  Wait a minute.  What about the video?  What about it?  You can't play any video on that?  Yeah, you can.  Where's your apps?  Where's your apps?  Do you have apps?  Stop with the apps.  No, I work out, but I...  I'm not saying...  I'm not like ripped or anything.  Andrew, do you Twitter?  No.  You know Valerie does the Twittering for me.  I know, but say what you say.  Hey, I like what you say.  But you should Twitter as Dice.  You should Twitter.  No, I'm going to get into it.  Somebody said they know how to teach me. 
[04:00:00]  My manager, Bruce.  I don't know.  That would be nice to occasionally get a word of wisdom from Dice.  Just tweet that thing there.  You can't really do it with Commando.  Commando's about phone calls.  Yeah, keep that one, but then keep a phone like an iPhone, a fucking Twitter or whatever.  No, my wife says I'll never be able to use it.  Dice is a call guy.  Dice is like, hey, where are you going?  Dice is phone calls, not texts.  Norton, it's Dice.  That's the way every message would start.  Norton, it's Dice.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I try to be nice.  Yeah, very gentleman. 
[04:00:30]  But you know, in this day and age, Dice, it's all about electronic media and tweeting and  Facebook pages and fucking, you know, DiceinBrooklyn.com.  Password Dice.  Password Dice.  You knew that?  Yeah, I knew that.  Doug knew it.  It's the scuttlebutt around the couch.  Scuttlebutt?  That's going to be great.  The scuttlebutt around the couch.  I never actually got to do a big show in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I used to play pips.  That's where I started at the comedy club. 
[04:01:00]  But when I was doing like all the arenas and everything, Cyclone Stadium wasn't even around.  No.  So that's why I want to like, it's like going home, you know what I mean?  Taking it back to Brooklyn, that Dice.  Yeah, I love that.  That is cool.  You know, it's a fucking ballpark.  It's going to be, you know, I'll be outside so I could be relaxed.  Yeah.  What do you think?  He was playing on the roller coaster?  No, no, no.  I didn't know what it was.  I didn't know his reference to.  It's a minor league ballpark in Brooklyn, Cyclone Stadium.  Oh, the island.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So it's a, you know, it's on sale now.  What is it?  Pre-sale, they call it?  Yeah.  Pre-sale, yes.  The clear stuff that comes out before the sale. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, so what is it again, Bruce?  What is it?  What?  What lay, what lay?  Dice in Brooklyn.  It's one word?  Dice in Brooklyn.  What is that?  That's a great ring.  That's a good ringer, though, right?  Oh, okay.  Isn't that a good ringer?  It reminds you of the old days.  No, it doesn't.  You know why?  In my house, I have rotary phones, my friend.  You have rotary phones?  Wow.  That's what I use.  You still use the rotary at that?  I use rotary because it's got the best sale.  Yeah, it really does.  You know what I mean?  So I got like five rotary phones in my house.  And you can hear it anywhere in the house. 
[04:02:00]  I love it.  I love it.  And when I get angry, I could bash it.  Nothing happens to it.  And nothing happens to those phones.  Big, heavy phone.  The phones today, they have no fucking backbone.  No.  You know what I mean?  They made them indestructible back then.  Yeah.  They never had to get a new phone.  You never had to get a new phone.  And nobody ever bragged about the phone they got.  No.  It was just...  When you were having a party, your dad never said, everybody, put your drinks down.  Come in the kitchen.  Get a fucking phone out.  Go on, fuck yourself.  Everybody would have left.  Motherfuck.  When you moved into a place, you got a phone. 
[04:02:30]  Your phone was like there.  Yeah.  And it was like already 20 years old.  Yeah, people want to go, you know, it goes with the motif of the beige fucking kitchen.  It was black or white.  Do you know what I do hate?  When you go somewhere and you want to buy something.  And even like...  Yeah.  My mother still has the same phone from 1957.  Jesus Christ.  It's the best.  It's the worst.  Today, everybody just follows.  Like, you go to like a carpet store.  I had to get like some new carpet for my bedroom.  So I'm asking the guy like about Burba carpeting. 
[04:03:00]  He goes, oh no, you know what everybody's getting?  And I'm like, well, who the fuck is everybody?  My neighbor?  I don't even like my fucking neighbor.  The fuck do I care?  I want red fucking carpet.  Who cares about earth fucking tones?  I'm so sick of people just wearing earth tones, beige, brown.  You've never liked beige dice.  Just blending in with the fucking trees.  Fucking assholes.  And that's how their lives go too.  Yeah.  You mute yourself down.  See my fucking wife?  You become milquetoast.  See how fucking beautiful? 
[04:03:30]  She's in colors.  I'm not going to comment on her clothes.  Don't ask her, man.  For fear of offending, I'm not going to comment on her clothes.  I love that she wears colors that, like I look at her, it's like a...  She looks very nice in the stripes.  I like the stripes.  Don't say nothing about the pants.  Stripes are on the back.  Oh, shit.  No, it's all right.  I don't get mad at that stuff.  No, she says like he likes those kinds of pants.  I like those kinds of pants.  There's a way to say it.  I'd love to continue doing this for years, but the next show's coming in. 
[04:04:00]  What next show?  What next show?  Should we stay for that?  Should we just stay for that?  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Where do we got to go?  Ron and Fez.  Where the fuck did Opie go?  He's at a doctor's appointment.  Opie took off.  Oh, did he really?  Yeah.  Opie took off.  You know, my son Dice does it.  Your son Dice.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Don't do that.  He does like...  I say Anthony does the best Dice voice, but he does the best Dice impression.  Oh, no shit.  He's around you all the time.  I wouldn't doubt it.  But I never saw it until recently. 
[04:04:30]  Really?  He didn't?  And he does it in his act when he's destroying my life.  Oh, that's gotta be great.  You know, when he talks about...  I won't do his material on the air.  Oh, that's funny, man.  I would love to see that.  No, he's like an edgier, like, Seinfeld.  He's got that kind of thing going on.  But unlike Seinfeld, who won't say a bad word?  Fucking little mocky asshole.  Jesus.  You know, wearing suits like a fucking accountant on stage.  You know what I mean?  It's the guys like me, Norton, Stanhope, Chappelle. 
[04:05:00]  We get in trouble.  We tell the fucking jokes.  J.P. Morgan does the fucking.  You know what I mean?  Saturday, October 1st, 8 p.m., MCU Park in Brooklyn.  Brooklyn!  That's New York.  Pre-sale begins right today, yeah.  DiceinBrooklyn.com.  That password, what is it?  Dice.  Dice!  Exactly.  And now the Tropicana, Atlantic City, Saturday, July 30th.  And I will give the shout-out to governors.  It's already sold out. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, yeah, please.  You're doing a couple shows there.  And you're going to come down and hang out?  Yeah, I'm right by there.  So I'll pop down there.  I did.  Me and him did the cellar together last time I was here.  Yeah, my brothers.  Oh, I want to do the cellar.  You know how I love this guy?  Oh, please.  Who doesn't?  You know that, right?  I do.  I love you, too, man.  He's so sweet.  When I saw him at the premiere of Entourage.  But what happened to you?  And right, Entourage.  Sunday at 10.30 on HBO.  You stopped to do an interview, and I just kind of figured you were going to talk.  And all the episodes.  I'm not even talking about me.  The episodes are great.  They're really great.  And Doug, Doug, Doug, where the hell is Doug Stassel? 
[04:06:00]  Doug Stassel, where are you here today?  What are you going to be, Doug?  I came in to do John Stassel.  Oh, yeah, John Stassel.  Yeah.  I'm plugging out of the new DVD.  What's John Stassel?  He's a guy.  He's a libertarian guy.  He's got a show on Fox Business Network.  Oh, you got a business?  Yeah, he's a great guy.  I don't know if anyone sees that show.  I didn't even know that network existed.  I'm glad I'm meeting you, because when I saw that special, Eleanor will tell you. 
[04:06:30]  Yeah, we watched it together.  That's when I knew her.  You still know me, Jack.  You know what I mean?  When I knew her, when we were hanging out.  Right.  And we watched it together, and I said, this guy's great.  You know what I mean?  Well, thank you.  Thank you very much, sir.  I'm not even kidding around.  Sometimes I've got to be real.  You know what I mean?  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.  Thank you so much.  Would you fucking wait one second?  I can't.  I can't.  You know radio time.  Andrew, we have another guy.  Andrew, you're not a rookie.  Keep that fucking blending.  You're not a rookie, Andrew. 
[04:07:00]  You know how this works.  All right.  Get it done.  Over here.  We're over here.  Now we've got to go over there.  I'm over here.  Over here.  I got the mud flaps.  Hey, Andrew, always a pleasure to see you.  Anthony, great seeing you.  That happy face.  Great seeing you.  Best of luck.  Best of luck touring, and we'll see you next time.  And Sam, I guess you're going to take over for 20 minutes?  About four.  Yeah.  Listen to Sam's shit show.  Bye.  Later.  All right. 
[04:07:30]  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  After ONA Live is next on The Virus.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, you didn't think I was going to take this away from you today, did you?  You didn't think just because I only had a few minutes, I wouldn't treat you to After Opie and Anthony Live, did you? 
[04:08:00]  Of course not.  That's what this is.  After Opie and Anthony Live, I'm Sam Roberts.  Dice is back.  It's always great to have Dice back in studio.  For some reason, there's nothing funnier to me than stories of Dice stealing things.  Just because he doesn't have to.  And, I mean, it is.  It's just like a childlike sort of thrill that he gets out of stealing things that, I mean, we can all relate to it.  And it's hilarious to watch somebody shoplift so unabashedly the way Andrew Dice Clay does. 
[04:08:30]  Always a pleasure to have him back in studio.  But, look, we have two minutes, maybe.  Iraq, are you there?  Yeah.  How are me and you?  You got a minute and a half.  No, no, no.  How are me and you?  You have a minute and a half.  Oh, wow.  Come on, Eric.  Why are you mad at me?  The rest of the stuff on the disc, Eric is upset because we went to Comic-Con and I came back with audio and one of the clips was a girl yelling about Iraq. 
[04:09:00]  Now, you know, I don't know why he has such a problem.  Yelling about, I mean, look, Iraq is a public figure and there's not much we can do about that.  I mean, I know his nerves are high with the staff stand-up comedy contest coming up in, what, two days now.  So, I don't know if that has anything to do with his mood. 
[04:09:30]  I don't know if maybe he was upset at the way Opie and Anthony started this show.  I know he doesn't like when they say negative things about management because he holds those guys dear to his heart, as a lot of us do on the staff.  And I know that he doesn't like when mom and dad are fighting.  And by mom and dad, I mean the show and management.  I don't know if that did something to him and so he was a little oversensitive.  But I hope, even though he doesn't want to talk, that Iraq's listening and knows that, you know, I didn't mean to hurt his feelings. 
[04:10:00]  I didn't want him to, I didn't want it to upset him.  Ten seconds.  You okay, buddy?  All right, well, I guess we'll see you tomorrow with more Opie and Anthony after Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Bye-bye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[04:10:30]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
