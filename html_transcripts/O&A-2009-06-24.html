<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the unexpectedly cold Seattle weather, transitioning quickly to internal workplace drama.  Travis voiced frustration over unexplained changes in the broadcast booth, while Steve's suspected sick-day manipulation was playfully, but pointedly, addressed by the hosts and staff.  This led to a debate about company sick-time policies and a comparison of E-Rock's memory to that of a dog, alongside a backlog of "bunny stories." Travis further complained about poorly communicated changes to the commercial system, sparking a broader critique of excessive management layers and seemingly pointless job roles within the company. A caller, "Whitey," shared a family anecdote about faking busyness at work.  The hosts then expressed their dislike of people wearing "designer glasses," viewing it as a camouflage for incompetence, engaging several callers on the subject.  Bill Burr joined the show in studio at this point.

The conversation took a darker turn, revisiting past instances of illegal wiretapping of the show, fueling the hosts' distrust of new equipment, particularly a recently installed XM radio device suspected of being a hidden camera or microphone. A segment promoting a vulgar "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" sticker followed, using profane language.  A discussion about Joseph Brooks, the "You Light Up My Life" writer indicted on numerous sex crimes, including rape and assault, then ensued. This segment included dramatic sound effects and highly offensive dialogue simulating a rape scene. The show concluded this section with continued discussion of the Brooks case and the hosts’ reactions.


The next section opened with a story about a woman who received 56 stars tattooed on her face after falsely claiming to have fallen asleep during the procedure.  The discussion then shifted to baseball, focusing on the suspected steroid use of players like Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, and the disillusionment among fans.  This segued into a lengthy and explicit discussion about attractive women, involving Mars and Patrice, and detailed descriptions of various women's physiques, particularly their buttocks. Specific pornographic websites and performers like Melissa Ford, Kira Augustina, and Vida Guerra were referenced.  The conversation included detailed commentary on different body types and racial preferences.  DJ Scribble then joined the show in-studio.  He shared stories from his career, including his early work with Biggie Smalls, experiences as a graffiti artist ("bombing trains"), his collaboration with Dave Navarro, and his controversial firing from Hot 97 after a DJ competition.  A segment of his music was played, described as a rock and hip-hop mash-up.  The show concluded this section by returning to the discussion of women's physiques.


The following segment began with a caller recounting a humorous, though uncomfortable, jail experience. This transitioned into a story about Frankie Blue, a legendary figure from the hosts' past, and an audio clip of his on-air meltdown at a Hot 97 Christmas party was played.  DJ Scribble, already in studio, then discussed performing for US troops in Dubai, commenting on the city's rapid development and subsequent financial troubles. He performed a live mix. Callers shared their own Dubai experiences, highlighting infrastructural issues. The conversation then veered towards the newly released Nixon tapes, with graphic and offensive discussions of Nixon's views on abortion and interracial relationships. Excerpts from the tapes, containing extremely racist and offensive statements, were read aloud. The show concluded this section with discussions on California's marijuana legalization, anecdotes about potent marijuana strains, and humorous comparisons between the effects of extremely potent marijuana and sex. Jason Ellis briefly joined the show during this segment.


The final segment featured Jason Ellis recounting several anecdotes, primarily focusing on his experiences with drug use. He described a drug-influenced trip to Costa Rica, including hallucinations and airport paranoia.  He also detailed a bizarre experience in Paris involving hash, heavily tattooed women, a fire-breathing performance, and a sexual encounter with a prostitute. He discussed interviewing Fedor Emelianenko (who kicked Ellis multiple times at his request), MC Hammer (focusing on Hammer's financial struggles), and Bridget Nielsen (described as a "crazy bitch" with speculation on her oral sex skills). A significant portion was dedicated to Jeffree Star's offer to perform oral sex on Ellis, leading to a phone call with Ellis's wife.  Finally, the show discussed a Maury Povich segment featuring overweight children, with the hosts making numerous offensive jokes about their appearance and parents. The segment concluded with a quick outro and a DJ Scribble freestyle.  No other guests beyond Ellis were mentioned as being in-studio during this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, the O.P. and Anthony Show. Good morning.  Ooh, on a Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yes!  It's whip them out Wednesday.  On a nice overcast rainy morning.  It's unbelievable.  Here in Seattle.  It really is unbelievable.  Did they flip the coasts?  Yeah, something happened.  I, like, stood the earth up on its axis the wrong way. 
[00:00:30]  We're supposed to have warm weather by now.  It's supposed to be hot by now.  Hot! Hot, motherfucker! Hot!  It sucks! Goddamn!  Eh, tomorrow's supposed to be better.  What are you gonna do?  What are you gonna do?  Tomorrow?  We've been saying tomorrow's gonna be better for weeks.  The sun'll come out tomorrow!  I can't hear that without thinking how horrid their lives are.  They're the little Annie girls.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Another banner day.  Hope we get better.  Whatever.  War!  The staff is in a tizzy.  I love it.  Chicken without heads.  I love it.  Chickens without heads.  Travis is pissed off at the company because they made some changes in the booth.  Yeah.  Which don't make sense.  So we're trying to get to the bottom of that. 
[00:01:30]  And then...  We'll never get to the bottom of it, by the way.  And then Sam pointed out that Steve has cold medicine on his desk.  So he's planning another sick day in the very near future.  He's gearing up for another sick day by planting...  He's gearing up for another fake sick day by planting cold medicine around the office.  That's like, yes, I have a cold.  Goddamn Sam points it out.  Yeah, he's got cold medicine right on his desk for everyone to see because he's setting up for another fake sick day.  Yes, I'm out.  Did you notice the medicine on my desk? 
[00:02:00]  Everyone is on to Steve's fake sick days.  I hope he understands that.  Yeah.  Maybe we should have told him off air, but we're all on to the fake sick day.  Yeah.  I guess what's happening, the company said that you got to use all your personal days by when?  By like October?  No, I think we have like a year.  But there's so...  So many hours have accumulated over the years.  Yeah.  That it's like everybody just has a ridiculous amount of sick time.  We never take off. 
[00:02:30]  No.  And it's funny, when we do take a rare personal day or something, the fans just bitch and complain.  They go crazy.  Yep.  Because we trained them.  We trained them and got them used to, you know, a lot of radio.  We get days off.  I mean, we get like holidays and things like that off.  But compared to radio shows, regular radio shows, nowhere's close to the amount of time we should...  Not even.  ...should take.  And the guys are in the same boat because of that.  Yeah.  Now they're sitting on a bunch of sick days that, you know, with this company, 
[00:03:00]  you better just take them as quickly as possible.  So now people are faking sickness.  Oh, I'm sick.  Making believe someone in their family is having a kid.  I mean, the things we're hearing lately.  What did you have yesterday, Danny?  Yeah, what was wrong with you?  I want to sleep in a Titus.  The email that I sent...  Yeah.  ...alerted Steve that I would be taking a sick day.  Oh.  But you weren't sick, right?  Well, you can't really say that.  I said that I would be taking a sick day.  That's it.  Hey, there you go.  If you say that, the company can't question you. 
[00:03:30]  You can't question an employee for taking a sick day.  He's taking a sick day.  So Steve's gearing up for another sick day.  Yeah.  What do you think?  He'll go for the long weekend?  Ouch.  My ass hurts.  You have a long weekend, I'm thinking.  What do you think?  Oh.  Friday?  Friday?  No one gets sick in the spring and summer.  I do.  I mean, you get that rare...  My immune system seems to be failing.  You get that rare summer cold, everyone. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe every other year.  Yeah.  But man, Steve loves the sick day lately.  Oh, my God.  This weather changing is awful for me.  Is it?  Did you notice the day quill?  And then you got E-Rock, who's got the brain of a dog.  I was just laughing at the E-Rock.  Yesterday, and he's going to go, I don't remember this, which is going to be perfect for what  I'm about to say.  There's another bunny story.  There's a story we're going to get to, hopefully, in a little bit.  Bunny lady has 334 rabbits. 
[00:04:30]  It's a new story.  But there's another bunny story from last week.  We never got to.  So we got, like, two weird bunny stories.  So yesterday, and you know what?  The listeners could back me up.  In the middle of the show, like, as Ant was doing something, I kind of, like, kind of  was talking under Ant, like, E-Rock, give me that bunny story.  I'm going to go to that later this morning.  Yeah.  Or get it in front of me, or something like that, right?  And it's not in front of me.  Because what happens with E-Rock, he nods, you tell him something you need, and he's  like, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  And he's all about it.  And then as soon as he leaves the studio, he forgets he ever had a conversation with  you.  Kind of like a dog.  Like, if you go out of your house and come back five minutes later, your dog has no clue  how long you've been gone.  No clue.  E-Rock's the same way.  He'll come back in.  His tail will be wagging.  Hi.  Do you need anything?  He's eager to please, but as soon as that, something happens when that studio door closes  and he leaves.  Bacon, bacon, bacon.  Oh boy, oh boy. 
[00:05:30]  He goes to himself, what was I supposed to do?  Oh, well.  Whatever.  I think I was, ah.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Where's the bacon?  I smell bacon, bacon, bacon.  Gotta be bacon.  Only one thing smells like bacon, and that's bacon.  Bacon, bacon, bacon.  There.  Please, please.  Give me what's in the bag.  Chewy, yummy, smoky, bacon.  There you go.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  It's bacon. 
[00:06:00]  Ah, yeah.  So there's a lot of weird little things going on today.  He looks like a dog.  That's so funny.  Travis, you all right in there?  I don't know.  Oh boy, Travis is like boggled.  What happened?  And you know, keep it professional.  All right, I'll keep it professional.  Let Ant and I be the ones that completely exaggerate things.  Okay.  Let us be the assholes.  Don't know how many times I have to look at a boss and go, oh, we were just doing that  for the radio.  Yeah, it's the radio.  Don't worry about it.  You know, just for the radio, we were doing that. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, none do you worry about.  Go ahead, Travis.  All right, so there's a button in here that when you guys go to break every break, I push  this button and it sends the show to Washington.  Oh.  Where they take care of commercials.  All righty, that sounds pretty convenient.  But Washington's really far away.  Yes, and there's a one second gap in between me pushing that button and the commercials playing.  Uh-huh.  And that's got to be changed.  It's changed, right? 
[00:07:00]  Why?  It doesn't.  As long as it works.  Yeah, as long as it works.  We've understood the gap.  So what does this mean to Travis?  Well, this means that this morning I come in and Mars tells me that now all of the commercials  are loaded into Dillette where I usually play things.  Yeah, yeah.  So I don't, but nobody told me this.  So I don't know if I'm supposed to be playing these commercials or if I'm supposed to be hitting  the button that I've been hitting for the last three years or.  Or three years you've been hitting that same button. 
[00:07:30]  And now they decided.  It's like, I'm like Desmond in Lost.  I just hit this button.  Yeah.  And now they've decided to change the whole thing around but not tell anybody.  Yeah, you know what?  It wouldn't necessarily be a problem.  Just changing is fine.  But not telling anyone and just doing it.  Just doing it.  And now you have no clue what to do.  I cannot wait.  I have no clue because this first thing.  I can't wait for the first break.  This first thing right here says three minutes and 59 seconds.  Yeah.  But our breaks are four minutes and 22 seconds. 
[00:08:00]  So I don't know if I'm supposed to be playing this.  I don't know if this just shows.  I can't wait now for the first break to see what a clusterfuck this is going to be.  But did they tell anyone they were making these changes?  No.  No one was told.  No.  Mars told me this morning that this program was installed in Dillette.  He doesn't know why.  It's just there.  Why wouldn't they tell us, Mr. Mars?  They were asking for this application so they can see what DC played out of. 
[00:08:30]  And according to the email, it was to be done ASAP.  And ASAP was done, but apparently nobody on the ONA staff were aware.  Wouldn't that be the most important people to tell is the ONA staff, the ones that use the computers and the software?  Wouldn't that be the most important people to tell?  It's like changing the software in the shuttle and not telling the pilot, like the commander, that we changed everything.  And he goes, for years when I fly this shuttle, I hit this button and it launches. 
[00:09:00]  Now it doesn't work anymore.  And not only that, I don't know what makes this thing launch.  That's a good analogy.  I'm amazed.  And this isn't just a SiriusXM thing.  It's a radio thing in general.  They just overthink everything.  Yeah, it's way overthought.  Everything.  And there is a SiriusXM thing going on.  Well, I'm trying to be nice because I've been beating the shit out of them lately.  I just think there's this phasing out of anything XM. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's obvious.  So Washington, to go down to Washington for the commercials, why do that?  We could do them here in-house.  So let's put it on the system that Travis has been using to play funny songs and little beds that we do during the show and litter it with commercials that he has no clue when they're supposed to be played, who hits them, cues them.  And now can you still, like, pop music on? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I played that Eric Bacon thing just now.  Yeah.  But I can't play things from where I usually play them.  I'm playing them from a different—  Oh.  Not to be too technical.  But do you have access to all of that stuff you've had?  Yeah, anything you want to hear, I'll be able to play.  And a song, like if it's at a whim, on a whim you decide, oh, that song will fit here.  Oh, okay.  I can do all that.  All righty.  We're just not sure why this is here.  Oh, my God. 
[00:10:30]  They're usually pretty good about telling you guys, but they didn't do that this time?  No, it just kind of showed up.  All right, well, we'll get to the bottom of that.  I'm sure bucks will be passed.  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure we will never know why, who, how.  Oh, well, it was just something that had to be done.  There was an engineer from fucking Saskatchewan.  I don't know.  No one ever has an answer.  No one ever has a name.  Well, the system has been set up in such a way there's no way of tracking who did what. 
[00:11:00]  No, no.  This is perfect.  Right.  It's like a child porn ring.  Right.  You can't find out who's actually doing it.  You can kind of know the players, but you don't know really who to charge with the big crime.  Yeah, who to charge with the big crime.  Where's the Mr. Big in this?  Right.  Where's the numero uno hombre?  It's a bunch of henchmen, but no, it's a bunch of cronies.  Wow, man.  When I first started in this business, it was just so simple. 
[00:11:30]  It was just so simple.  You didn't have all these levels of management.  Nothing.  So much management.  You went on the air, did your show, one guy, you overseed everything.  So much management now.  It's unbelievable how many levels.  Just suits and ties.  I don't even know.  I see people that work for this channel.  I don't even know what they do.  I don't know what they do either.  For real.  And I'm thinking to myself, wow, I really want your job.  You know what it is too?  I don't think they know what to do. 
[00:12:00]  So they just do things to say, here's what I did today.  Like I always say that, and I'm not just this company.  I'm talking about a lot of companies.  If you're sitting there and your boss comes up to you, or it's not the big boss, but it's  your supervisor, and he makes you do something stupid, it's because he's got to go back to  his boss, and his boss asks him, what did you do today?  And then he goes, well, I went up to this gentleman here, and I made him do this and  that because we needed to do this. 
[00:12:30]  Meanwhile, that didn't need to be done.  It needed to be done so he could tell his boss he did something, or else the boss might  go, wow, you really aren't needed here.  Oh, yeah.  So there's a lot of that shit going on.  Well, there's another thing that's going on.  Like if you were, I'm wearing a t-shirt today.  Yeah.  And he's wearing casual.  T-shirt with a little buttoned down over it.  That's unbuttoned and very casual.  Yeah.  The thing I've noticed about radio, satellite radio in general, if you wear a suit or designer 
[00:13:00]  glasses, you're just trying to blend in and hope that the big, big boss doesn't realize  that you're completely useless.  Yeah.  It's like you're...  The guys that are walking around very casual with t-shirts and whatnot, those are the important  ones at this place.  If you're wearing a suit, you're not important, and I'm on to you.  If you're wearing a suit, designer glasses, you're not important.  I'm on to you.  I think they hope they'll fit in, like just blend into the crowd so the big boss won't 
[00:13:30]  know which suit it was.  Right, right.  It's like, I don't know.  It was a guy wearing a suit.  Yeah.  The boss walks down the hall and goes, I think, hey, he might be a...  Who's responsible for that?  I think it was the guy with the suit.  He might be a shareholder.  I'm not really sure.  I don't know what he does.  See?  Is he a guest?  Look, this guy's walking down the hall.  He's got like, you know, shorts and a kind of sweatshirt on.  That guy...  Phil Collins hairdo.  Phil Collins, that guy must be really important here.  For real.  That's how it works. 
[00:14:00]  For real.  Look at Sam.  We all know how important he is.  Oh, God, with that dumb walk.  Oh, look at this.  Waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle.  Waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle,  waddle.  With his big stupid afro ponytail that I'm getting so annoyed with.  Yeah.  Why doesn't he let his freak flag fly anymore?  Just a complete wreck.  Did I say overseed? 
[00:14:30]  Wade, I don't know what you're getting at, Zeno.  I'm a little confused.  If I miss...  Oh, whatever.  Whitey, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey.  You guys are talking about people that don't know what they're doing at work or you don't  know what they do.  My grandpa, just when he got out of the service, he worked for a construction company at a nuclear  plant site.  He did...  Whenever he started, he was told by his supervisor that he didn't know what he needed to do so 
[00:15:00]  to pick up a two-by-four and just carry it around looking busy.  He did it for over two weeks.  Every day, he would come to work, pick up the same two-by-four, and just walk around.  Walk around with it.  Look...  Yeah, he just finally got bored and quit.  There you go.  Look, I'm not saying these people shouldn't blend in.  Hey, whatever works for you, but...  Hell, yeah.  I've had many jobs where I went through the motions.  Leave our shit alone.  I just want to acknowledge that I...  You know, we're on to you.  We're on to you.  Right.  We're on to you. 
[00:15:30]  By the way, sir, you still there, Whitey?  Whitey!  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's nuclear.  What did he say?  No, it's nuclear.  No, it's nuclear.  Oh, you're one of those guys.  I say nuclear.  This drives me fucking batshit.  It's spelled...  I know.  That's why I did it.  N-U-C-L-E-A-R.  Nu-Clear.  Nuclear.  Now say finger.  Nuclear.  Fern.  Nuclear.  Anybody, especially a world leader, when I heard George W. Bush saying nuclear, it drove 
[00:16:00]  me nuts.  The guy's in charge of the whole nuclear arsenal, and he can't even say the word.  Say the word.  It's nuclear.  Nuclear.  Anyone who's saying nuclear, you're saying it wrong, and he sounds stupid talking about  it.  All right.  Just have to clear that up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Witty.  Witty.  Later, guys.  Okay.  Witty.  Oh, this guy's not happy.  He goes, Carolina Man. 
[00:16:30]  He writes, oh, enough about the designer glasses.  I'm one of the guys that sells doctors the lenses that go in those designer glasses.  No.  Give a man a break.  Guy's just trying to earn a living.  I hate designer glasses.  You know who I earn a living?  Really?  I hate them.  What constitutes the designer glasses?  When you're just trying way too hard.  Like, you can get a nice pair of glasses, but you know them when you see them.  Just over the top, way too much going on. 
[00:17:00]  Like the opposite of Travis's, which looks like he got them from Goodwill.  Yeah, exactly.  These are Armani glasses.  What?  Yes.  Travis, come in here.  I'll tell you if I hate your designer glasses.  Armani glasses?  Well.  I don't know what it is with designer glasses.  It's a faux pas, I mean.  Well, why do you think I'm bringing this up?  This is a way of telling people I don't like them.  Why do you think I bring this up?  Look inside the freaking words. 
[00:17:30]  I didn't know if you witnessed some of these encounters walking in the hallway.  Yes, I know a bunch of our bosses have designer glasses.  That's what I'm getting at.  And they talk about them to each other?  Yes.  Wow, that's fucked up right there.  Like the business cards in American Psycho.  Yeah, yeah.  Travis has Armani glasses on.  You're safe.  They're nice glasses, but they're...  And they're probably technically designer glasses.  I wouldn't know those from designer glasses.  I swear to you.  You say those are Armani?  Mm-hmm.  It just looks like you pulled them off of some kid in a playground. 
[00:18:00]  Those are okay.  Those.  Armani.  I can't read that.  I need glasses.  Those are all right.  Those are really nice glasses.  They're just normal glasses.  They're not pretentious.  Yeah, there's not all sorts of shit going on.  There's so many designer glasses.  I can't even, like, steer you in the right direction to show you awful designer glasses.  You're talking about those glasses that you'll see, like, on those ads in the subway with those people that are just, like, you know, posing with these thick-framed, almost, you know, like Rivers Cuomo from Weezer. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's say E-Rock just pulled up some.  Yeah.  That's designer glasses.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  You know what I mean?  And half these guys that wear them, they have good eyes.  It's the look.  Really?  Yes.  It's the look.  Yeah, take their glasses off and smash them in front of their face.  Trust me, they'll be able to pick up all the pieces. 
[00:19:00]  They could still see.  I guess round glasses are out, huh?  Yeah, for the most part.  It's like the whole square thing and kind of ovaled, squarish thingy is in.  Yeah, look at that.  They're just, I don't see one pair of round glasses there.  I want giant aviators, like in Top Gun.  I want to walk around like that with big aviators on.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him with his tortoise shell fucking designer glasses.  Yeah.  That guy deserves a punch. 
[00:19:30]  Let me say hi to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Hello, Matt.  Oh, what happened here?  Matt.  Let's try this again.  Matt, what's going on?  Yeah, that's better.  Hey.  Come on.  Hey, boys.  I hope you were saying that people who wear just, you know, normal clothes, the serious  XM are probably the most important people there.  Does that mean that Little Nicky is vitally important to this company?  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you something about Little Nicky.  He does amazing production.  We make fun of the guy, but supposedly he's the best production guy in-house. 
[00:20:00]  Don't make fun of him.  In-house.  We have fun with him.  Every time he arrives at work.  Yeah.  But because of our bit, he can't be late to work anymore.  Oh, because he's Little Nicky.  Let me say hi to Joe in Cleveland.  Joe.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Joe?  Nothing much.  Yeah, I'm talking about this designer glasses bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love Joe Henry!  What? 
[00:20:30]  I wish a lot of times they would stay on the line just so they could reiterate what they're  trying to say.  What?  Anyone?  It sounded like he screamed out an O. Henry, so I guess he likes the O. Henry bar.  No, I don't know what he was saying.  It might as well have been.  If you're going to blurt something out like that, make it articulate.  We couldn't hear that.  I have no idea.  All right.  Uh, Butcher made this. 
[00:21:00]  And now, Marketing 101 with Craig Opie Hughes.  You want me consulting?  You're going to pay.  Pay me!  Fuck you, pay me.  Marketing 101.  Name recognition.  That's all you do is put the name of your product out there as much as possible.  Oh, that's going to cost you.  That was some consulting right there.  Pay me!  My brilliance now comes with a price tag.  Pay me!  No more free brilliance.  Sirius XM owes me $200 so far.  Pay me.  Fuck you, pay me. 
[00:21:30]  And because I'm promoting the Sirius XM app on my Twitter, because I got enough followers,  I'm charging for that too.  Pay me!  And I want cash.  So I can hide it from the government.  Damn.  Hey, Butcher, right on.  I like to pay me.  I like to pay me.  Pay me!  Pay me!  For your consulting.  I'm such an asshole.  You don't think I'd...  You're consulting for the company.  Of course I know I'm an asshole.  Of course.  You know what, though?  Our bitchin' and complaining got that app thing turned around a little bit. 
[00:22:00]  Certainly did.  Now, instead of saying the virus, what does it say, Ant?  It says the virus.  Yes.  Correct the moon, though.  And then I noticed there's new electronic...  We are so suspicious, too.  We are so paranoid and suspicious.  Apparently, they dropped in a new electronic device.  It seems to be an XM satellite radio device.  Right in front of me, and...  Hey, Bill.  Right in front of me, and I'm thinking, all right. 
[00:22:30]  Mars is like, so you can see the pad data.  Yeah, yeah.  We've been back doing radio for five years.  I've never looked at the pad data.  I never really needed to.  I don't need to look at the pad data.  So I'm like, all right, what's in this thing?  Is there a hidden microphone?  Is there a camera?  It's pointing right at me.  It's pointing directly at you.  It has the most...  It has the most important spot in the studio right now.  Yes, it does.  Couldn't that be off to the side?  Because it's not...  If I had to look at pad data, is it that important?  It's not going to pick up your voice if you put it off to the side. 
[00:23:00]  It's staring right the fuck at me.  So we're looking at it going, do you think that's a microphone?  We're like the Sopranos in here.  In between breaks, we've got to turn the music up real loud.  If you can talk to each other with our mouths covered.  If you know anything about mice or rats, when you introduce something to the rat environment,  the rats see it right away.  Yeah.  And they adjust.  Yeah.  You know, you can't just put a trap in the middle of a rat environment.  They're going to go right around that fucking thing.  Got to trick them. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, and that's what they're doing with us.  Every time we see a new piece of equipment in our environment, we get very suspicious.  Is that a camera?  Is that a microphone?  What is that?  You just flung it off of its little mount.  Unplug that goddamn thing.  Yeah, if I unplug it, I bet you it would go over the air.  Oh, right in the garbage, pal.  That went right in the shit can.  I can't even tell you how much stuff I have to pay for. 
[00:24:00]  It's fun for the radio, then.  Bob gets involved.  You know, that cost...  They're going to take it out of your paycheck.  That's going to come out of your pay.  Matt made this.  Are you a fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  No.  Go fuck yourself.  All right.  Wait.  Do you like naked bosoms?  Who the fuck doesn't?  Do you like Wednesdays?  Who fucking cares?  How would you like to see some naked knockers for free?  Oh, go fuck...  Wait.  Yes, I would. 
[00:24:30]  Well, then just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Opie and Anthony show.  Attention, wow stickers.  1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, 10020 today.  And get yourself a free Whip-Em-Out Wednesday sticker.  Sweet fucking Jesus, that's easy.  So is your mother.  Now stop cursing.  Why can't people just say 6th Avenue?  What do they say?  Avenue of the Americas.  Oh.  It's like, does that sound better?  Or...  Something just went in the garbage bag. 
[00:25:00]  Ah, shit.  I'm in a rare form today.  You might as well...  Banner day.  You might as well make sure you listen to me.  Strap in, people.  Bill Burr, how are you, my friend?  Bill Burr, in studio.  I'm trying to figure out what was going on.  There was some sort of little notepad and it was plugged in, I think.  I don't know what you did, but I like the direction you're going in.  Yeah.  The...  Little device.  There was a device in front of me.  A gadget, as we like to call it. 
[00:25:30]  A gadget, a device.  And by the way, because I'll hear about this later, that we're a little too suspicious.  Let me tell you something that happened at NAW.  And let me tell you something that happened at AAF.  And the faithful listeners have heard these stories and I apologize, but we've had two  incidents of wiretapping with the Opie and Anthony show.  Complete illegal eavesdropping.  Two that we know of.  Yeah, that we know of.  Might not know of other ones.  I'm sure there probably were.  These are two that they fucked up and we were able to find out.  Yeah.  And one of the guys works here at SiriusXM and smiles when he sees me, you know. 
[00:26:00]  I haven't seen him, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  He's here.  But he made believe he was our friend at NAW and he was secretly taping us because we  were involved in a multi-million dollar lawsuit.  Yeah.  And he was...  I don't know how much we could say, but he was basically wiretapping us, hoping we were  going to say something to the contrary of what was presented to the authorities.  He was able to, like, you know, wing ding some wires around and then during the breaks 
[00:26:30]  when the mics were off, they were still live.  So he was able to hear us when we shut the mics off during commercials and we'd be like,  that guy's an asshole.  Fuck this guy.  This guy's a shit.  And got it all on tape and was trying to use that.  But that's not a miscible in court, is it?  To illegally...  No, of course not.  Or is they just trying to figure out what's going on?  Where you guys are thinking?  Probably how to play it or something.  Civil suit is different than criminal, so...  This was a multi-million dollar lawsuit, so... 
[00:27:00]  And the guy works here, and I just stare at him.  He tries to smile and say hi.  I'm like, stop.  And then another case was at AAF, where we found out that the GM, the boss, general manager...  You know, boy.  Boys, boys.  Boys.  Boys.  At any time, whether the mics, again, were on or off, whether we were doing the show or  sitting back bad-mouthing people, like we always do when the mics go off.  Listen to this one, Bill.  You're going to love this.  He could dial his phone in from anywhere in the world and listen to what we're saying 
[00:27:30]  in the room at any time.  So we were like...  And when we found out...  Wow.  We actually were like, no fucking way.  So I think we were driving around once up in Massachusetts.  Yeah.  We got the number.  We got the number.  We're like, let's give this thing a try.  And I forgot who was on the air.  It doesn't even matter.  I think it was Rock Hole.  Maybe it was Rock Hole.  And also, we're listening to Rock Hole with the mics off.  Yeah.  I'm like, this cannot be legal.  So then we figured out a way to get into the phone closet.  And before the show, every day, we would unplug the one wire. 
[00:28:00]  And the boss would come in, and he didn't want to acknowledge that we knew.  But the next day, it was plugged back in.  Yeah, it would be plugged back in every day.  And we would unplug it every day.  Click, unplug it again.  And he couldn't come to us and go, stop unplugging my wiretapping.  My eavesdropping wiretapping.  Oh, that's awesome.  Hear you, device.  Right.  Asshole.  So we don't trust when new equipment just pops up in studio.  So that apparently was an XM radio that was placed precariously close to Opie so he could 
[00:28:30]  see the pad data, which is the little shit that's written on the bottom during a break.  Usually it just has the phone number so you can call the show.  So this would just have Opie, Anthony, Bilber, maybe.  Right.  They would say that.  Because that's, you know, who's talking.  Later on, it would be like Penthouse Girl or something.  You needed that whole little device just to...  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Tuesday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on. 
[00:29:00]  I'm not buying it.  That's what you get when you're shock jocks.  Yeah, we're shocking, all right.  And it has nothing to do with shock jocks either, because I think they probably do it  in the 70s channel station, too.  I think it's like Stalinism going on in this place.  You can't even walk to the bathroom without being on 10 different cameras.  You are on camera.  Have you noticed the amount of video cameras in this place?  I've just noticed them in general.  Try to not be on camera.  Try and not be on a video camera. 
[00:29:30]  You can't in this building.  Everywhere you walk, you are being looked at.  Peek-a-boo, Bill.  Filmed in...  Yeah.  Well, that's the future.  That is the future.  It's here and now.  Anthony, E-Rock just handed me an instant feedback that simply says,  as much as I want to bash him, you told Steve, not E-Rock,  about the bunny story.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  So, E-Rock... 
[00:30:00]  I went into the back office after I got off the phone with DC  and said, what is this bunny story?  And then somebody informed me that Steve was told  and just wrote bunny story down on his notepad.  Bunny story.  And walked to the back.  So I asked Steve and he said, oh, Travis said he was pulling this.  Oh, go get Travis involved.  No, I had to.  Well, first of all...  The passing of the buck again.  I hate to have to do this, but E-Rock, I'm sorry.  Thank you.  All right?  Wow.  For once, you're not the fat slob in the room.  Oh! 
[00:30:30]  What are you saying about you, Mark?  That was nice.  That was very touching.  What an apology.  I was just going to say, there's a change in Opie.  Yeah.  It is.  Why?  I don't know.  The apology?  Yeah, no, you just...  It was nice, right?  Yeah, and you're not giving off the...  Remember, we always talked about how silently we both broke each other down the first time  we met each other, and I'm like, oh, that guy's me.  All right, I'm not fucking with that guy.  No, because I...  That guy's me.  I know me, and I see me and Bill, and I'm like, no fucking way. 
[00:31:00]  He would go to the same ugly place as I would.  Yeah.  But you're not like that.  No fucking way.  And, like, he used to have, like, Opie used to have, there was a, I don't know,  a red tint to his skin from decades of rage.  It's just rage.  It's just somewhere in the neck, and you just saw it, and I'm just like, I'm not fucking  with them.  And when you started to do the apology, I didn't see any of the rage.  Hell no.  I'm like, it's just, it's gone.  No, it's...  It was like a 28 Days Later guy, just full of that rage disease. 
[00:31:30]  No, I mean, it's still there when it has to be.  Oh, it never leaves.  But it's nice to...  No, it's kind of left.  It's nice that I don't have to deal with it every day anymore.  Trust me.  It must be nice to have a day off from that.  What?  From, like, rage.  Oh, yeah.  Just like, hey, I had a whole day off.  It was nice.  I was told by someone that might know that I suffer from irritable depression.  Oh, I thought it was irritable bowel syndrome.  Well, I have that, too. 
[00:32:00]  What is irritable depression?  I don't know.  You're just so annoyed all the time.  It just brings you down.  Yeah, but this is the thing, though, about...  But she said that I don't really suffer from that as much right now.  That's good.  Yeah, but having, like, a temper is...  It's just like being a drug user, where you're clean for, like, six years, and then  when you fall back, you pick up right where you left off.  No, dude, you're going to go right to the...  I look forward to that day.  You're going to go right to the penthouse next time you flip out.  You know what? 
[00:32:30]  There's some fun that's involved with all that.  Of course.  Oh, you know what?  I forgot to tell you guys.  Last week, I'm staying at this hotel, Midtown.  I can't believe I forgot to bring it in.  Maybe because it's so damn early.  You should have seen the memo that they sent everybody the day before the Puerto Rican  Day Parade.  Oh, really?  It was so hilarious, because they had to act like they weren't warning people, and they  had to act like they were celebrating the culture, and they're like something, whatever.  Attention guests.  Just to let you know, this Sunday is the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade. 
[00:33:00]  The Puerto Rican Day Parade happens on the first Sunday, every June, and each year, over  four million Puerto Ricans come down to celebrate, as well as others, another four million in  the outer boroughs.  Holy shit, that's a warning.  And they just kept talking, celebrating, and a parade, and a celebration of the ethnicities,  and four million Puerto Ricans had it like...  Meanwhile, it's like...  All guests, back to the compound. 
[00:33:30]  Pull back.  Retreat.  Puerto Ricans.  Yeah.  They still, you know, just have to cover themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  In case, you know, you go for a walk in Central Park, and maybe you get finger-banged against  your will, up against one of those beautiful weeping willows.  The hotel should have informed us.  That's a complete liability issue.  They just wanted to know that they informed their guests.  They're not going to be caught in a wilding episode. 
[00:34:00]  They totally...  It was the nicest paragraph ever about Puerto Rican culture, but the whole subtext was,  there's going to be a shitload of them.  There's going to be four million Bengal tigers walking around.  They're going...  They're beautiful animals.  Endangered species.  Endangered, right.  They're beautiful to look at.  One, uh...  What was the one year where it was just all hell broke loose?  That was a long time ago already.  Every guy's girl was getting groped.  That was like 2000 or 2001.  Not every guy, but... 
[00:34:30]  You know what it was, though?  One bad parade, you're fucked.  It was.  It was ridiculous.  The video that came out of the...  I know.  Those incidents.  They cracked out.  There hasn't been like one bad issue, though, with the Puerto Rican Day Parade since that.  No.  But everyone just goes, oh, you know what happened in the Puerto Rican Day Parade?  Yeah.  Girls are getting carried around like bowling balls.  No, and before that year, everybody would go, because you want to go look at all the hot  Puerto Rican girls.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just like, wow.  Hoochie mamas.  Yeah.  I don't want to...  Yeah, it was like live Telemundo. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  That was fantastic.  And they had the memo in the hotel, huh?  Oh, I wish I brought this.  God, that's great.  Two things.  I was also trying to find one.  This email this girl sent me after I did my Tonight Show.  Oh, I told you that one.  The No More Shiny Suits.  Oh, Shiny Suits.  No More Shiny Suits.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, they...  Oh, here's some of the wilding.  Yeah, Danny has found some of the videos.  I just saw some booty and some shorts, and I decided to click on it.  There's some ass hanging out of the bottom of shorts, and the store owners used to board 
[00:35:30]  up their stores and everything after the wilding episode, because one year, I don't know  what happened.  And they just went crazy, started just ripping girls' clothes off in the street.  Like Bill said, it was 2000, 2001, somewhere around there.  That's hilarious.  Closing them down with, like, water and beer.  And women don't have any responsibility in it, like, ripping, or what, that G-string she  was wearing?  I just came here to celebrate my culture.  Why don't you put some clothes on, sweetie?  But the Fembots would say that women should be able to wear whatever they want, Bill. 
[00:36:00]  Bill's putting the blame on the victim.  I'm just trying to get some collars.  I actually agree.  An old trick.  I actually agree with you.  No, it's one of the...  I mean, you see some of these outfits, and you're like, come on.  If I was a caveman, this would be illegal.  Oh, yeah.  Just bonked on the head and dragged into the cave.  Oh, yeah.  Banging that thing like crazy.  Why don't we take our first break, Bill Burr is here?  Uh-oh.  Oh, look at Travis.  What happened?  Travis is panicking.  It's the first break time.  Oh, right, right.  Travis is panicking. 
[00:36:30]  He doesn't know if the button's going to work.  I've got to grab this new mouse that I don't...  Oh, no.  This is insanity for Travis.  Where did E-Rock go?  Because we were onto something with the E-Rock bunny thing.  He blamed Travis, but he was also blaming Steve.  Yeah.  I think there's a little misunderstanding, actually.  There's a lot of buck passing.  But I wanted to get E-Rock's thoughts on Steve's fake sick days.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a good one.  Because E-Rock...  Steve's already gearing up.  Look at the weather.  He's already gearing up by placing cold medicine around his office. 
[00:37:00]  God bless E-Rock.  He started running.  Look at his attempt.  No, he was running, and then he ran like three steps and said, nah, fuck that.  He did that slow jog that you do when you're crossing, and the lights turn in red.  I was ready to give him a major compliment.  Like, look at E-Rock move.  Yeah, but this really is the hallway of shame.  If anybody catches you, you have at least nine minutes of airtime where people can trash you  before you actually get into the studio.  You can't look good walking up that hallway.  No, there's no way.  You're right.  When we came here, they offered us four or five studios the same size.  We're like, oh, fuck. 
[00:37:30]  But as soon as we saw this studio with the long hallway, we're like, we could have fun with  this fucking hallway.  You could see anybody coming.  No one's surprising you.  That reminds me of those comedy clubs.  Like, the worst comedy clubs, the bombing, are the ones when you get off stage, you have  to walk back through the crowd.  Through the crowd.  Yeah, just looking like, ah, Jesus, dude.  You suck.  Don't quit your day job.  Fucking 90 rows of that.  Oh, you just suck.  You're unfunny.  Asshole.  Back.  E-Rock.  Next guy.  You're funnier women. 
[00:38:00]  What do you know on Steve's fake sick days?  I don't want to really try to do it, but they seem to fall on a front.  You said, I don't really want to trash the dude.  Is that what you just said?  That means you really want to trash the dude.  They seem to fall on Fridays and Mondays.  And in the case of, I'm not saying he's not sick, but in the case of the last sick day  he took, I got an email early Sunday afternoon saying that he had, I guess, sent a notice out 
[00:38:30]  to you guys, to Bladder and Cross, that there's a possibility he may not be in tomorrow.  He's not feeling good.  So he wrote, okay, and then I'll get something in the morning.  I'm not coming in today.  So it's like he prepped you so he's saying, I may not be coming in.  And then all of a sudden Monday comes.  I'm not coming in.  Oh, if there's an email from Steve that says, there's a 1% possibility I may not be in, he 
[00:39:00]  is absolutely not coming in.  It's textbook sick day crap.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fake sick day crap.  No, we used to see it a lot when we were still over at CBS.  There'd be days where all of a sudden it's like he's not at what, and some people didn't  know he wasn't coming in.  Look, we've all faked a sick day.  Of course.  I don't understand people that are sick for only one day.  I hate the sniffles.  Yes, remember, Cindy Brady got the sniffles once, and her mother was very upset. 
[00:39:30]  But sometimes you can't tell, because if I'm in the same office with him, and you'll turn  around, and he's kind of breathing heavy, and he's soaking wet.  Well.  Like he's just sweating really heavy, but he's been sitting in the same chair for an hour.  So you're like, how is he doing this?  But he's been that way forever.  I have the swine flu.  He's sweating.  And he has cold medicine on his desk?  And four open cans of Monster Energy drink.  Oh, that's smart.  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:00]  And a large coffee, a cocaine, and some barbiturates.  And some crystal meth.  Amphetamines and crystal meth.  Right.  Well, now we have a, there's three huge boxes in the office, because we don't have any more  space to put stuff in.  There's a huge monster refrigerator, a stand, and a big inflatable monster can that are now  in the office as a gift for Steve.  Oh, it's so small.  Pop that fucking balloon.  You're bringing it in here.  I'll take care of the problem. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, that problem will be solved.  And then I was told that we may be getting some more O&A merchandise coming in finally.  Really?  But there's multiple boxes, and they're asking, can we store it in the office?  So there's going to be no room to walk in that room.  See, why?  But I need the space.  Who wants to store shit?  I need the space.  Who wants to store shit in our office?  Everybody.  But when are we going to get respect?  Never.  We have equipment from the old studio that we're not allowed to use anymore in boxes in both 
[00:41:00]  offices.  Just throw it in the hallway.  Someone will come along.  Lob it into the hallway.  Someone will come along and get it.  Or maybe you want to take them home.  They're the old PalTal cameras and the lighting fixtures that we had.  Oh!  You want those?  Shh.  Keep it quiet.  No, just store them at your house.  I'll store them at my house.  Okay.  Thank you.  Show me the box when I leave.  Wow.  I'm wiring that house up.  I swear.  I said I was going to do this.  Wire that house up.  Wow. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  So Steve will be sick tomorrow or Friday?  Probably Friday.  Friday.  I'm thinking I may be sick Friday or Monday.  Perhaps both days.  And then Thursday of next week.  So when we're off on Friday.  Very rare possibility though.  So don't worry.  I'm sick.  I'm not coming.  I point zero zero eight percent chance.  Eight percent chance of sickness.  Oh my God.  It hit me.  Classic.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  Fucking classic, man.  Well, when we get back, we got the bunny story.  Oh, finally.  Remember that song, You Light Up My Life?  I certainly do.  I think we brought this story to everybody.  Who knew?  But we got an update on that guy.  Yes.  You know the song, right?  Dirty Birdie.  Who made it famous?  Debbie Boone?  Debbie Boone made that famous.  You got a little taste of that, Travis, from Bill Burr?  I believe there was a movie called You Light Up My Life.  You know this song?  I know the song, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  The guy who wrote this song is a bad, bad boy, Bill.  He's a dirty, dirty boy.  Good for him.  We'll tell you next.  It's bad.  What was the other thing?  Oh, did you see that guy got off for beating up that girl?  You know those two people who aren't really famous, but for some reason they're like,  yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Chris Brown and Rihanna.  You didn't have to go to Jets.  One for us, guys. 
[00:43:00]  Every once in a while.  You get it.  Every once in a while.  You know, that's like, you know, it's like the old Brooklyn Dodgers.  Every once in a while, they'd win a World Series.  Them bums.  Every once in a while.  You can slap them around.  Oh, and the story of the day, Nixon.  The Nixon tapes.  This I read and just.  Holy shit.  You know, Tricky Dicky.  Holy shit.  Been dead for a while, but he lives on with these tapes that he used to decide to just.  I have to hit record.  Oh, yeah.  Everything needs to be recorded in my White House. 
[00:43:30]  I don't like him.  He is a Jew.  Jews.  Yeah.  The colored.  Like every anti-Semitic racist.  This motherfucker recorded everything.  Where's Henry Kissinger?  My head Jew.  And this one is just a hoot.  Once you hear what this is.  I'll read the headline.  Nixon tapes reveal blank stunner.  Yes.  Blank stunner.  And we'll tell you what the blank is. 
[00:44:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony with Bill Burr.  Hey, I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on the Sirius XM app.  Yes, on their iPhones.  I hear the app's doing very, very well.  It is.  People are loving it.  Love my apps.  Do they have one?  Can I use that on my BlackBerry or no?  I have no idea.  Did we already have this conversation?  Oh, boy.  I have no idea.  Oh, boy.  I believe you can listen to Sirius XM on your BlackBerry, but just in a different way, I guess. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Did you get the new iPhone, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yes.  That's so funny.  I love it.  Don't you remember the last time it was a piece of shit and it was overpriced and then  a few months later?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be great.  That's what everybody said.  Yeah.  No, this is great.  You're going to be screaming about it in a week.  The video is fucking...  The video is amazing.  Yeah.  The pictures are great.  He's got a good phone.  The apps are fucking fantastic.  I'm loving it.  Jesus.  Look at that phone.  It really is from the future. 
[00:45:00]  It's the future.  It's my communication device.  My tricorder.  Everything.  It does everything.  Yeah, but can you...  Don't fucking throw it.  I was going to say there's a lot of trust involved.  Can you get something...  How much is it?  $700?  I don't know.  If you buy it like fucking...  I don't know.  If you're free?  If you don't sell yourself into dentrics?  Yeah.  Next week, it'll be $300.  It's sleek.  I know.  It's sexy.  It's now.  I hate seeing that.  Yeah, I know when they do that.  You buy some nice technology or... 
[00:45:30]  God damn it.  This is a nice phone.  Why does it have to be AT&T?  Well, that's what everybody says, but like I was saying...  When does that contract end?  You know, if you idiots just wouldn't buy it and we'd just wait until it was Verizon,  everyone would be good.  But I've had crappy systems with Verizon and everything.  No, you haven't.  Yeah, I have.  Verizon's great.  I've had Sprint.  I've had everything.  And occasionally you go, fuck, I lost my signal.  You can be at the bottom of an elevator shaft and get a call with Verizon. 
[00:46:00]  Hello?  Where are you?  All right.  Why don't we move into some material?  Hey.  So the guy who wrote You Light Up My Life.  Yeah.  It was a big hit for Debbie Boone way, way, way back.  I won one of the maskers.  Really?  For the song?  Yeah.  Really?  It was a biggie.  Academy Award.  How does it become an Academy Award song?  It was featured in a movie.  I know.  What movie?  I don't know.  I think it was called You Light Up My Life.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  They like made a fucking movie out of the song or some shit.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not kidding.  The song was so goddamn popular.  Based on a three, four minute song?  Yeah.  Well, this is what's going on with the guy that wrote the song.  The hands of Joseph Brooks once held an Oscar award.  Today.  Here it goes.  Today.  Today.  They're in handcuffs.  Today he's holding his head in a cell.  The hands of Joseph Brooks once held an Oscar award. 
[00:47:00]  Today.  They were shackled.  Brooks is best known as the writer of the 1970s ballad, You Light Up My Life.  Because you.  Give us a little.  You light up my life.  Today.  A New York grand jury indicted Brooks with 91 counts for sex crimes.  He's accused of luring victims to his apartment by touting his connections.  He reportedly raped and assaulted them while they auditioned for movie roles.  His accomplice?  Prosecutors allege this local federal way woman, 42-year-old Shawnee Lucier. 
[00:47:30]  Lucier did not respond to numerous attempts.  I thought that was audio from the rape.  The Foley artist or something.  We need a door knock.  Audio from the pounding.  That's one of the women we had in door.  I love the knocking on.  No one's going to answer the door.  They don't answer.  Lucier did not respond to numerous attempts to contact her today.  A Manhattan district attorney announced nine indictments against Lucier for criminal facilitation in the fourth degree, each punishable by up to one year in prison. 
[00:48:00]  Lucier is Brooks' personal assistant.  She's accused of helping him arrange meetings with victims.  Nine of the 11 victims, aged 18 to 30, reportedly responded to a Craigslist ad.  Oops.  You got to watch that Craigslist.  Holy jeez.  These guys are in the 70s.  Rick, you can really just do that and get all the way up to 91 people before they get you?  I know.  How fucking long was he doing this? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, no.  We weren't quite ready, Travis.  I licked my sweaty balls.  There we go.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I'm going to fuck you in the mouth.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll rip your ass so hard you won't sit down for a week. 
[00:49:00]  Why did you do that?  Why did you spend everyone loving me?  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen! 
[00:49:30]  Pitted.  So pitted.  Everyone remembers this.  Come on.  Goddamn rich cunt!  I kill rich cunt!  I need a chance to say.  You're a little bitch. 
[00:50:00]  You're a little bitch.  How did you do that?  No!  No!  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you? 
[00:50:30]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  For many days I didn't bring them here.  Look at my vagina two times.  She was very badly raped, you see?  Victim of the modern age!  Poor, poor girl!  You ever seen a grown man naked? 
[00:51:00]  With socks!  This won an Oscar?  Yeah, certainly did.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Roll over and shut up.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da! 
[00:51:30]  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur!  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  Liar, whore!  Liar, whore!  And you know it!  I'm gonna come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll lick your ass so hard you won't sit down for a week.  You can get a doggy style or you can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get the sake.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Liar, whore!  Do you get it?  See?  You get it? 
[00:52:00]  He wrote the song and then he raped women.  That's the point we're trying to make with our comedy.  Wow.  See?  Be careful what you wish for.  Comedy.  The second part of the story.  Seven alleged victims are from Washington State, two from Oregon, others from California and Florida.  Brooks reportedly flew most of his victims to New York, promising them an audition for an acting role.  Prosecutors accused 71-year-old Brooks of forcibly raping most of the victims. 
[00:52:30]  In many cases, they were incapacitated, possibly with drugs in their wine.  Brooks is in custody tonight.  Meanwhile, Lucier from Federal Way here is expected to turn herself in next week.  What did she get out of it?  You know what he basically did?  He basically did what they used to do on the casting call.  Yeah, the casting couch.  Yeah, way back in the day.  He went old school.  He probably doesn't think he did anything wrong.  No, what's wrong?  He thought it was business as usual.  He didn't realize the times have changed. 
[00:53:00]  You want to be a star?  Yeah, I'm going to make you a star.  Zip.  I'm going to break you in first.  I remember the old days.  He used to get Clark Gable's seconds.  That's all he's doing.  Let's go.  23 skidoo.  Now making her way down the red carpet.  Okay.  You want to be a triple threat?  There was a reason it was the red carpet.  Oh, ow. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, oh, oh.  Remember that girl that had the 56 stars tattooed to her face?  I certainly do.  The tattoo artist, apparently she fell asleep.  She just wanted three stars there.  And the tattoo artist just kept tattooing stars on her face.  And it was very terrible of that man.  Well, he's to blame sort of because, I don't know.  Is he?  She was young.  Yeah, I am. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, a young girl comes in to get 56 stars on her face.  Problem, problem.  I don't know.  Maybe the tattoo artist should have some kind of responsibility now.  No.  Okay.  And once you get up to like 23, maybe you can wake her up and be like, not even halfway  done here, sweetie.  Yeah.  Well.  Well, everyone smelled something as far as this story goes.  Something fishy.  Well, she came out yesterday and said that she admitted that she lied because her dad was  furious. 
[00:54:30]  No shit.  Look what she did.  So she wanted the 56 stars.  She got the 56 stars.  She went home, realized, oh, fuck, dad is going to be pissed.  And then came up with the I fell asleep story.  Look what she fucking did to her face.  What the hell?  Well, why 56 stars like that?  Wow.  Does she have other tattoos?  That is really, really bad.  Doesn't matter if you have other tattoos.  Get them on your face like that.  Can I get a picture of that?  I want to have a picture of that.  Just hang it on my bedroom wall. 
[00:55:00]  And anytime I feel depressed, I'll be, oh, but you know what?  I didn't get 56 stars tattooed to the side of my face.  Isn't that the worst when you become the example?  Yeah.  Like that ends up being the meaning of your life.  Oh, I got the sniffles.  There's a 1% chance I think tomorrow.  Oh, please, please.  I might.  Be tomorrow.  Be tomorrow.  I might not be in.  Oh, be tomorrow.  Please, please, please.  Don't touch that.  It's infected.  I'm a fan of the sick day during the week.  Yeah.  It's the best.  Not the long weekend sick day. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.  Oh, I don't know.  I think I caught what Steve has.  Homosexuality.  All right, we got the bunny story.  We got the Nixon story.  Yeah.  We got a quickie from the Phillies manager, Chris Wheeler.  Quickie?  You want a little quick sports one?  Yeah, what is that?  This one's fun.  This one's fun.  Poor all you baseball fans out there.  Why are you wearing a Bruins hat today, Bill?  I don't know.  What?  Bruins fan?  I don't know. 
[00:56:00]  Most people put their hockey hats away for the year and go like Red Sox or something.  Oh, you know.  You just grabbed the hat.  I'm fading away from baseball.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Because I got, you know.  Why?  I just got a feeling that there's going to be a whole bunch of other people that I liked  are going to test positive.  And every time, I just feel so stupid.  Dude, nobody gave a shit about baseball in like 1998.  After the strike, the only thing good that had happened was a couple years earlier, Cal 
[00:56:30]  Ripken broke the Lou Gehrig streak.  And all of a sudden, you know, McGuire, the year before, he came close.  So right from the beginning.  And I got on board and sat there like some Depression-era child.  Boy, oh boy.  Did you see that one?  Holy mackerel.  Then you find out, yeah, yeah.  They were fucking on Frankenstein roids.  Juiced.  You feel stupid.  Yeah, if you look back, now one person questioned why he was all of a sudden hitting 500-foot  home runs. 
[00:57:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like these were monster home runs and no one was there.  We were all just happy.  Dude, Sammy Sosa was worse.  Sammy Sosa like was nobody.  And then he hit like, he had like a 600 home run.  He had like 550 of them in like a three-year period, it seemed.  And then he just sucked again.  Dude, that guy got caught with roids and a cork bat.  It's like, why don't you just have your friend underhand the ball to you?  You know?  Dude, I was watching the other day on the Yes Network.  They replayed the Game 6 of the 1996 World Series when the Yankees finally got back on 
[00:57:30]  track and won a World Series.  Dude, you cannot believe how skinny they are.  I was looking at their uniforms are tight.  I was going, that guy looks like a chick.  You should be wearing high heels out there compared to the guys.  In no time, monsters.  Just big, giant monster arms.  His point about Sammy Sosa.  Get Sammy Sosa's lifetime stats. 
[00:58:00]  Because, yeah, out of nowhere, he started hitting a lot of home runs.  Yeah, he hit.  A lot.  I think there was like two guys ever hit over 60 home runs.  He did it like three years in a row or something.  Yeah.  How the hell do you do that?  Steroids.  Steroids.  Yeah, they said, you know, he was one of those guys that gave that anonymous little thing  that they had to fess up to that said you did him, and then it came out because it's  not anonymous now.  It looks like Sosa started doing steroids, I guess, for the 98 season, because in 1997, 
[00:58:30]  he had 36 home runs, and then in 98, he had 66 home runs.  How do you do that?  Come on, stop.  And then he went 66, then 63, then 50, but I think, did he play a full year when he hit  50?  Yeah, okay.  And then he went back to 64, then 49, and then I guess the bones started getting brittle.  And then he faded out, 40, 35, 14, 21. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, God.  But before that, before he hit the 66, he went 33, 25, 36, 40, 36.  No, we're as close to 66.  Oh, no.  I mean, there's actually a lot of those numbers back in the day when you're the home run crown.  36 to 40.  Oh, I know.  You were right there.  Yeah, yeah.  For a while, that was it.  Yeah, two of my brothers never came back to baseball.  Well, I'm barely back.  I like to say I'm a Mets fan, but honestly, I'm not. 
[00:59:30]  No, the stats.  I'm not a rah-rah watching the Mets every day, that's for sure.  I take a little peek.  I look at the sports page every day, but I'm not.  The stats from that era.  That's for sure like it used to be.  Oh, ridiculous.  Everybody's just like 19, 26, 15, 860, 920, 1,012, 48, 2 out of baseball.  Out of baseball.  Had it.  So now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to figure, because look, all I got to do is just 
[01:00:00]  cover six weeks of sports, and then you go into football.  Because hockey and basketball will go right to the second week of June.  I figure you got the U.S. Open.  Wimbledon's next week.  Maybe I'll watch a fucking...  Wimbledon started, I believe.  Oh, it did?  Yeah, you know.  I mean, it takes a few weeks.  Hooker really is good.  I watch that, though.  Come on.  You don't watch tennis.  Some of the tennis is all right.  Oh, yeah.  No, I like tennis.  You watch that?  And the broads get out there with the little short skirts.  All right.  That ain't bad.  Bending over.  I know.  Asking for it.  I won't watch every fucking, you know, match, but nah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  You ever walk around the U.S. Open out there in Queens?  Why would I do that?  It's a good day.  Yeah?  It's a good day.  Yeah.  Bring one of your broads.  Yeah.  Bring a broad.  One of my broads.  It's a good day.  You walk from court to court, checking shit out.  Then you go into the main Arthur Ashe Stadium and check out a big match.  Yeah.  Nadal or somebody.  Bunch of disgustingly rich people walking around.  I don't know.  I can't.  I don't like tennis.  It's not my number one.  It's not even close to my number one sport.  I like tennis.  So it's like, why? 
[01:01:00]  It's just a good day is all I'm saying.  I'm not saying you're going to be like, holy shit.  Yeah, but a good day is like fucking hanging out in the yard.  Yeah, but you got beers.  You got the nice weather.  You got in the yard.  You got a lot of good people watching out there in Queens.  People watching in the hot tub.  And every possible food you could ever want to eat.  They know how to fucking do the vending thing.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That was good.  They have like the up-and-coming people on like the smaller courts.  And you can literally sit like me to you to someone who might be the next. 
[01:01:30]  Might be.  Yeah, but you forget their names.  But they're still great, though.  Dude, they're still great, though.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  Bill's right.  And I sat in those little courts.  I've gone to the U.S. Open.  I pretty much go to the U.S. Open every year for one day.  And I probably saw like the people that are now stars today.  But I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I would like to go back in time and go, what?  I saw her.  Oh, our big titted monster.  God damn.  Is this chick the best fucking tennis?  Look at her tits.  She's getting breast reduction surgery, Bill.  She should not play tennis with those. 
[01:02:00]  They're fantastic.  And those are anchored down.  And they're still moving nicely.  She's wearing a sports bra.  Sports bra on top of.  Yeah, a sports bra.  Dude, she is a phenom.  And I'm not talking about her tennis skills.  Look, when a girl has breasts that big, there's usually something else going on with their body.  Not this one, man.  No, she's working out like a mad woman.  She's got ridiculous legs.  Look at those things bounce.  And fuck it.  They're fantastic.  Bill, what do you think? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, that definitely doesn't suck.  But you know what?  Her ass needs to be a little bigger for those titties.  You know what that looks like?  That's what I'm getting at.  No.  That nice slender body with the huge tits like that?  Come on.  And they are just.  Now you sound like fucking Patrice yesterday.  What?  Jesus Christ.  What?  We had a penthouse chick in here.  She's all hot and everything.  And Patrice is just like, I understand how you white boys like that shit, but I need a little more, you know, ass on it. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, speaking of which, and then after the show, you ran out?  Yeah.  Mars and Patrice were all excited about one of these video whores.  Yeah.  That the, you know, the black, the black videos where they have the video girl.  It's a whole thing in the, in the, in the rap videos.  Oh yeah.  One of the girls was here.  She was like the top one.  Really?  And they're like, fuck that, fuck that penthouse pet.  And they bring her over.  I guess she was at shade 45.  Nice enough.  What was her name?  Mars, Melissa Ford or something. 
[01:03:30]  Oh my God.  You know Melissa Ford too?  Bullshit.  Really?  Wow.  Oh, now I feel like an idiot.  Punch that bitch up.  Now let me tell you something.  Let me see that bitch.  Mars later on in the afternoon sent me a picture of Melissa Ford.  She's a legend.  And she was ridiculous in the picture you sent me, but what I saw live was no big deal.  The picture was amazing though.  You sent later in the afternoon.  Get over there Mars.  Yeah.  She was here yesterday.  Yes.  She didn't look like that, Mars.  Because she wasn't wearing a G-string. 
[01:04:00]  Well, all right.  All right.  Oh, that's all right there?  See, look at that.  The ass is too fat.  Patrice and Mars were like, sorry.  What?  Look at this guy.  Patrice.  The ass is too perfect.  Patrice is like, no.  Huh?  No.  Anthony, please.  Too fat?  Honestly?  That's retouched.  You can tell.  The ass is way.  And the ass is too big.  The ass is way too big.  Look at the arch.  When it goes back, it looks like a fake ass.  And we're going to lose.  Look at Danny.  He's very happy.  Mars is very happy.  Big ass.  You're very happy. 
[01:04:30]  Me and you lose.  Show me another one.  Give me another one.  We lose.  Give me another.  I can't get into that huge ghetto ass, man.  Can't do it.  Nope.  Can't do it.  Nope.  Won't do it.  Nope.  A nice shake.  Nobody's asking you to.  I can't get on.  I won't.  But that's what guys do.  Somebody's forcing you into it.  Right.  But this is what we do as guys.  Nope.  I can't get on.  Look at that.  Come on.  Get out of here.  Fuck you with that ass.  Stop it.  Oh, no.  Look at her fucking thigh.  It's hanging down below the fucking top of the stool.  She's got a giant fucking ass. 
[01:05:00]  Fuck her.  Fuck her.  Fuck her.  I'll tell you.  Fucking two minutes with her, he would be sold.  Oh, yeah.  No way.  For life.  Hell no.  No way.  Okay.  Dude, she was definitely.  The only way I'm being sold by her is if there's a race war and we lose.  Wait.  So I should have got a picture with Melissa Ford yesterday, Mars?  Yes, sir.  I didn't know.  Yes, sir.  She was definitely very pretty in person, but that's a different girl we're looking at  on the computer screen.  No, it's not.  And Patrice was trying to explain to me, he goes, in the black world, she is everything. 
[01:05:30]  In the white world, you whiteys don't know about her.  Ah, is that hot?  Holy shit.  Is that what that looks like without the clothes on it?  That's not a real fuck, man.  That's got to be real.  Get the fuck out of here.  I've seen that in stores, pushing shopping carts.  You're like, fuck him.  That's magical.  So you're into the Melissa Ford?  You know her?  I'm into beautiful women.  She is fucking gorgeous.  I didn't even know her.  Did not even know who she was.  I ain't.  No clue. 
[01:06:00]  No fucking clue.  If I know her, yeah, she's a legend.  I'll admit, she doesn't have one of those giant asses, but it's oversized.  It's a big ass.  You guys like bigger asses.  There's like extra meat or something.  Something going on there.  There's something like, what is it?  Muscle?  Fat?  What is that?  White girls don't have that extra layer.  Listen to Jimmy the Greek.  He'll explain it.  White girls don't have that extra layer.  That's not true.  Yeah, it's true.  There's some white girls.  Line up the white girls. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, I know.  There's a white guy who can dunk a basketball, but generally speaking, we're grounded.  Thank you.  In general, the white girls don't have that extra fucking layer of whatever it is.  It's like a shelf.  It is a shelf.  And then there's like...  I'll tell you the most insane...  That's weird.  That's just taken with a fisheye lens.  The most insane shot I've ever seen was in one of those OutKast videos, that big boy  one, where that girl was dancing.  The end of the video, when they shoot up at him...  Dude, her ass is like... 
[01:07:00]  I don't know.  It's like those ones they used to draw in Marvel Comics.  It's the only way to describe it.  It's like literally...  That's a great way to describe it.  Superhero girlfriend ass.  I don't know.  I, um...  Who is that?  Danny's...  It's my favorite.  Danny's punching the table.  Why?  Who is that?  Whose ass are we looking at?  This is a chick...  She got kind of famous, I guess.  Her name is Kira Augustina.  She just came from like some weird like ass fetish message board. 
[01:07:30]  Let me see that picture all the way to the right with the little pants thing on.  All right.  Let's see this.  That's her.  All right.  See, there's nothing wrong with that.  That ain't big and fat like that other one.  That right there is what's known as a fanny.  A fanny?  A fanny.  It's perfect.  A fanny is...  Yeah.  That's...  A fanny?  That's medium-sized.  Danny, I'm in with these pictures.  These are...  This chick is nuts.  These...  No, I'll tell you...  These pictures are a lot different than the Melissa Ford pictures.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now pop up her again.  Pop up that rat.  That ass is manageable.  Chick again. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, no.  That's nice.  Yeah, that's nice.  Oh, God bless you.  Yeah, but that's that...  That's that angle with the camera.  Yeah, look at the angle.  The fucking camera's all fisheye.  Yeah, it messes it up a little bit.  I know.  Her crack looks like it's three feet long.  Right.  You don't have perspective with that shot.  That's silly.  Yeah, forced perspective.  Uh, Esther Baxter.  Someone wants us to check out.  I want to see this chick here.  That's Melissa Ford.  All right.  That's Melissa Ford.  Wow, that's pretty good.  She's got a very long ass.  Look at how big her ass crack is. 
[01:08:30]  Dude, it's fucking giant.  Show me another picture.  I'm trying to have you sell me on this, but I ain't fucking...  All right, well, you know, let's see Anthony's version of a nice ass.  Who are you going to put up there?  Who's in your ass Hall of Fame?  All right.  Pull up Dakota Fanning.  Who said?  Is that some child star?  Of course it is.  Who's the ass chick from...  Darla Hood.  From our gang.  Who's the...  Who's the ass chick from FHM that they pushed forward big time? 
[01:09:00]  Oh.  I forgot her name.  Wait a minute.  But anyway, with this Patrice thing, so...  Danny will find it.  So Patrice is saying that this Melissa Ford was way hotter than the penthouse pet we had  in yesterday.  And I just didn't see it that way.  And he goes, well, it's a black-white thing.  In the black world, Melissa Ford's everything.  In the white world, this Heather girl you guys had in is everything.  It's nice.  What's her name again?  Vida Guerra. 
[01:09:30]  It's smooth.  Yeah, yeah.  See, I know her because of FHM Magazine.  She's all oiled up.  They pushed her out there big time.  Big time.  You know, if you pull up somebody like fucking Scarlett Johansson, that's a nice ass.  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  Yeah, but see, now look at that second picture.  I swear to God.  Like a lot of those, when they really do like the booty shot, I swear to God, I think they  enhance how big it is.  Because that right there, she looks proportioned.  That other picture, she didn't.  Yeah.  That girl's smooth.  They rework a lot of that.  Yeah, she's a lot of that shit. 
[01:10:00]  Vida.  Filthy whore.  Vida.  Vida.  God damn dirty whore.  God, she finally got naked, huh?  There you go.  Look at that.  I like that.  It was all about the ass with this Vida girl.  Jesus Christ.  I guess the numbers were dropping and she finally had to get naked.  Is that too much for you?  Is that ass crack too long?  No, that's kind of droopy.  That ain't.  Vida's ass is droopy?  They're saying she has the greatest ass ever.  Look at Anthony.  Anthony wants to see a little Cub Scout.  I'm very picky, man. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Here's the question.  Yeah.  A white girl with a really nice ass.  You said Scarlett Johansson because you're assuming that she has to have a nice ass because  she's so beautiful.  I think she's got a nice ass.  Name a white girl that we know has a really nice ass.  Scarlett Johansson.  Kim Kondarshan.  I'm not white.  She's not white.  You know what's funny?  You ever see the white girl with a really nice ass?  There's always at least three black guys following her down the street.  It's fucking hilarious.  Of course.  There's always black guys hovering around.  Check out Coco. 
[01:11:00]  Ah, Coco.  See?  Coco, a chimp came up.  You punch up Coco the chimp.  There's Coco.  Oh, God.  What the hell is going on there?  Now, she looks like she has a dick.  I'm not going to lie to you.  That's like crazy.  There's extra muscles in there.  Danny, can you humor us and pop up assparade.com?  I love assparade.  You know assparade?  Of course.  Jesus.  If you don't know assparade, then you don't know porno.  Assparade.  Keith and Philly turning us on to assparade.com.  That's a good one.  And also big tits, round asses. 
[01:11:30]  Goddamn, Danny.  Assparade.  I got to see assparade.  What's assparade all about?  It's just chicks with big, giant asses.  I think I got a memo at my hotel about that.  The third Sunday of every June is assparade.  A lot of asses going on there.  Well, what else do you expect from assparade.com?  Wow, look at that one.  Oh, look at the...  All the way on the left.  What, that one?  Let me see.  Pop that one up.  Let's take a good look. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, she's got a dirty asshole.  Holy God.  What the fuck?  She's going at that cock like a lollipop, though, huh?  She's digging that one.  Bill, someone's saying you were talking about Buffy the Body.  Who's Buffy the Body?  Was I?  I don't remember.  My memory's shot.  Is anybody else having a problem with that memory?  Yes, Nick.  Yeah, yo.  Bill, you were talking about the girl from the Outkast video.  It's Buffy the Body.  She could have won the Horse Award. 
[01:12:30]  She what?  She could have won the Horse Award.  If you look at her ass, that's the biggest ass in the industry.  That's a god in the black world.  Buffy the Body?  Yeah.  Buffy the Body.  Let's look at Buffy the Body.  Yeah, she said when she used to go to school, they used to call her Duck Booty.  Duck Booty?  Why is that good?  She was all self-conscious about it.  They're saying that...  Go ahead, go ahead.  See, that's something called the thunderclap.  Like, that's what she's famous for.  She makes her ass clap, like, real, real loud.  Get the fuck out of here.  She makes her ass clap real loud. 
[01:13:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait, is that her?  Is that her, though?  Yeah, that other girl looked like she was actually a little classier than that.  Get the fuck out of here.  Someone's saying that Coco has ass implants, too.  Is that true?  Yeah, apparently she got that shit done in Brazil, that Coco.  Ice tea paid for all that.  Look at you.  You're in the know.  What's an ass implant?  How do you have...  Ah!  Dude, that's not the right girl.  That's not the right girl.  Get the fuck out of here with the ass clap.  That's not the right...  That can't be the right girl.  Ass clap.  Okay, you know, that's definitely...  Would you go out with a girl that could ass clap?  Why did she look so much cleaner in the video? 
[01:13:30]  No clap over here.  No clap for me, thank you.  All right, punch it out, Greg.  All right, thank you.  He's in the know, that guy.  What is it?  I don't know if he's...  Wait, wait.  What's an ass implant?  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  What makes up an ass implant?  That's not her.  Who's this?  Apparently it's Buffy the body.  She's ass clapping.  Do you find that attractive?  There's a...  Are you digging that, Danny?  Yeah, I don't mind that at all. 
[01:14:00]  What?  Fuck.  That ass has a life of its own.  Yeah, that's just...  Oh, that's a good time right there.  That was...  Oh.  That's not the girl from the OutKast video.  That girl...  No.  I'm not feeling that.  He's the...  Just put up to that...  What the fuck is that?  Could you go to Super...  Tangus?  Oh, Super Tangus.  Danny fucking knows it all.  Yeah, I was just showing Mars' website the other day. 
[01:14:30]  Thank you, Chris from Boston.  All right, this is SuperTangus.com.  Oh, SuperTangus.  This is where that other one came from.  This is that website that...  All right, all right, look.  Kiro Augustina came from.  These aren't bad asses.  Yeah.  There's a nice...  That's so deliberate the way...  These aren't bad asses.  I was like, James Kirk, these aren't bad asses.  Yeah, they're definitely better.  They're a lot better.  A lot...  SuperTangus.  SuperTangus.  Look at that SuperTangus.  See, that's...  There's nothing wrong with that right there. 
[01:15:00]  That's a great ass.  That's a great ass.  There you go.  It's not fat.  It's not...  Mars just pointed at that picture and went...  He made a sound.  He just wanted to see it.  He went...  SuperTangus.  Wow.  Okay.  That's a sight.  I don't know Spanish, so I don't know.  Where does it say next?  Where's the next page?  How about the arrow?  The arrow right there.  It's universal.  Transcends language.  The ass.  Anthony, Billy B. in Queens writes, 
[01:15:30]  Oh, my God.  That's a good line.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  I just saw Buffy the body.  She looks like one of JJ's Good Times paintings.  Ah!  Yeah.  Good Times.  Holy shit.  That's a good one.  Oh, Stacey Keebler.  There you go.  An amazing white ass.  Good job to Matt C. in Bloomfield.  Is she dead?  No.  She's all right.  I don't know.  She's still around.  No, you mentioned as a wrestler or a girl.  Boom, boom, boom.  Let's see.  Pow.  Boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[01:16:00]  Let's see.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  What is this?  Scrolling like 1998?  It's like 1998.  Wow.  Yeah.  What's with this picture?  Nice.  Nice so far.  She's got really long legs.  Good.  Really nice legs.  That's why it's taking so long to load.  I swear to you, this is like 1998 downloading a picture.  It's coming down like a slow curtain.  Doo, doo, doo, doo.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  There's nice.  Yeah.  See, that's manageable.  Look at you.  That's manageable.  Eh.  What's the matter?  You need a little bigger? 
[01:16:30]  You know, that's what makes the world go round, Anthony.  Nobody's saying.  It certainly is.  Jesus.  I got another one.  What you were saying when I was fucking saying that that's big, you're like, what are you  fucking crazy?  I didn't say she wasn't good looking.  Go fuck yourself.  I was like, eh.  Mars, what do you got?  How about Jessica Biel?  Jessica Biel with the nice white ass, right?  Yeah.  Jessica Biel.  But she's not all white.  Yeah, that's nice.  There you go.  She's not all white.  I don't think so.  I think she's got a little something going on.  Nah.  They're all hoos.  Jesus.  Also, Daphne Rosin's coming in. 
[01:17:00]  Rachel Starr.  Rachel Starr.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jessica Maximus.  Who's that?  Kim Kardashian.  That might have been the worst.  Fuck Kim Kardashian.  Kim Kardashian is so fucking overrated, it's ridiculous.  Thank you, Bill.  And I'm going to tell you why.  Thank you, Bill.  I'm going to tell you why.  Go ahead.  Because, look, if I just saw her, look, I don't understand how Reggie Bush can get  with her because I get it.  You get with the girl.  She's been with other guys.  But they have actually video documentation that not only you saw, everybody else saw. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I just see her and I just, I don't know, I just pictured, she just has jizz on her.  She needs to be steam cleaned.  I think her sister's way hotter.  But I'm alone in this one, Bill.  You seen the sisters?  The other one?  The short one?  You know what I just laughed at is how hard, like, how many bathrooms are in that house  so Bruce Jenner can behave himself?  Oh, right.  You know, if Woody Allen gave into that fucking mess of a chick that he fucking married.  You know what I mean? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Oof.  Bruce Jenner and his lesbian hair just losing his mind.  Oh, did you see that thing when they were talking about the nose job that he got?  No.  Oh, that awful fucking nose job.  Yeah, evidently he didn't like his nose, which he looked fine.  Right.  And he got, I guess...  They fucked it up?  Yeah.  It was, the whole thing was just classic, someone who gets plastic surgery where his nose looked  fine and in his world everybody couldn't stop looking at it and didn't give a shit 
[01:18:30]  about his gold medal.  So he goes out and he gets a nose job.  Right.  And then people are like, what the fuck did you do?  That looks bad.  What'd you do to yourself?  Yeah.  And then for like the last 20 years, he thought, like, everyone was just sitting around still  talking about it.  It's like, no, we weren't.  We're bad acting on Chips Eclipse.  Oh, God.  Look at that lower right-hand corner picture.  Yeah, he looks like an old lesbian.  That cannot...  Oh, that's a lesbian.  Damn.  If you didn't know Bruce Jenner, you would go, that has to be a lesbian, an old lesbian.  That's Chaz. 
[01:19:00]  That's Sheriff's daughter, Chaz.  Witness protection.  A little altercation here.  How about Kai Toy, no?  Anybody on that?  Who?  Everyone's coming up with their favorite ass.  Pinky is the one who does the ass clap.  You don't like Pinky?  All right.  All right.  And Crystal Steel and Brandi Taylor all coming in.  Yeah, Brandi Taylor.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Now, wait a minute.  What was this?  Oh, my God.  Look at these two.  They're so fucking excited.  They're co-conspirators and asses. 
[01:19:30]  They just show each other ass pictures all fucking morning.  Here's a white girl for you.  This is delicious.  All right.  Let me get a little look.  Nothing but white.  Nothing but white?  Nothing but white.  There you go.  Oh, no.  That is a fat ass.  Nice.  That's a fat ass.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  That's from...  God damn it.  Crazy.  Why do you guys like the bigger ass?  You guys love fat ass.  I just...  Well, what are you going to do with tits?  Can I ask you a question?  What is the thing with big tits? 
[01:20:00]  What are you going to do with them?  I'm not talking about...  I don't like big tits.  I don't like, like, giant fucking nasty sloppy tits.  Like that tennis girl where her body was out of proportion.  She had, like, triple F fucking titties.  And she had the ass of a seventh grader.  Those are Ds.  You suckle on them, Bill.  Suckle.  Because you weren't allowed to when you were a baby.  For any guy...  Aren't tits fucking boring to most guys after, like, 11th grade?  You can't grab a girl's fucking ass unless it's fucking giant.  You need a giant-sized ass?  No.  You get an ass, you can wrap your hands around it. 
[01:20:30]  You know, I always forget...  What does the big ass say?  Anthony is just, like, a little...  What does it say about these guys that they like the big ass?  Wait, I gotta hear what...  I don't know.  I just was looking at you, like, your little bony build.  And I'm just...  You and another little bony chick.  I just picture you in, like, a little white trash trailer.  Two little bony, dirty white people just banging away in there.  And just picture him riding Anthony and his awful bony legs just sticking off him underneath him.  Holy shit. 
[01:21:00]  With his dirty Reebok still on.  No!  That is not the way I have sex.  Yeah, a little George Foreman grill in the nightstand.  Mac and cheese just filling the air.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Mr. fucking Universe over there with your body.  I'm not.  What are you talking about?  You just, you know, I'm just...  No, I'm a mess, dude.  Laying there at Mr. Diversity with your red fucking pubes.  Shut up.  It's more of a burnt sienna.  All right.  John.  John on the phones, he says,  Sarah J looks like her ass is on a hinge. 
[01:21:30]  You guys know Sarah J?  On a hinge.  You know Sarah J, too?  Yes, yes.  How the fuck do you guys know all this?  They know them all.  That's when you're jerking off too much is when you actually know...  You just know the names, what they look like, their fucking...  The movies they're in.  The tail of the tape.  It's like when the NBA draft's coming up and you already know all the draft picks' names.  Yeah.  That guy was on a fucking mammoth stage out there in fucking Montana.  Really, dude?  Really?  You know what's fucked up, though? 
[01:22:00]  I'm pretty impressed with their knowledge of this.  It is pretty impressive.  You know?  They're like, oh, yeah.  I just know.  All right.  Puddle of A's is trying to bring everyone back together.  Puddle of A's.  He writes, pigtailsroundasses.com.  I think we know what we're going to get there.  All right.  This brings everyone back together, though.  Pigtails roundasses.  Who was that one?  Sarah J.  Yeah, she's all right.  All right?  Sarah J's all right. 
[01:22:30]  She's it.  Phoebe Cates, as far as a nice white ass.  I'm trying to think.  Phoebe Cates looked pretty goddamn good.  In the red bikini?  In the red bikini there.  Saw her tits, right?  In Fast Times.  All right.  There was nothing wrong with that.  You know something?  Big Booty Judy.  Big Booty Judy.  You know something?  There's so many of these girls on the internet.  How is it possible to not even have a good-looking girlfriend? 
[01:23:00]  I don't understand this.  Yeah, you can just take your pic off the internet?  Mm-hmm.  Well, if you just go through, like, acting, all the arts, singing, women in sports, porn,  walking down the street, there's really no excuse.  Yeah, there are quite a few.  The phones are just lit.  Jesse Summers is coming in.  I'll tell you what.  I want to see Big Booty Judy, though.  Anna Kornikova. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  As far as, I mean, forgettable.  She was.  I loved all the shit that she got.  Really good.  Like, because she wasn't the number one player in the world.  Most girls with half her looks would just be sitting around waiting for someone to buy  a free drink.  Yeah, yeah.  And she got to, like, you know, all right, I'm the 11th best tennis player in the world.  She almost got there.  This is what's coming up for Big Booty Judy.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's Photoshopped.  Come on.  Anyway, so, speaking of sports, yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Although, I've been at a Walmart.  I've been at a Walmart, and you ever see those fucking really.  That's what Anna was saying.  They're pushing the carts.  Yeah, with those stretch pants on.  And just giant asses that are, I'm captivated by them.  It moves differently from the rest of the body.  I have to keep looking, because it's just bizarre.  It's a freak show.  Yeah.  You're deformed.  Yeah, you're deformed.  I'm fucking deformed!  So, this started with a sports thing.  So, Philly's announcer. 
[01:24:30]  I might have said manager.  If I did, I apologize.  Philly's announcer, Chris Wheeler, had something fun to say the other day.  It's a quickie.  He's back up again.  For the injured Clay Conjury.  Hey, Retro Night, that was a great tune just then.  That was Rock Around the Cock.  Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley and the Commons.  Bill Haley from Chester PA.  Whoops.  Rock Around the Cock.  The Cock.  He's back up again for the...  When you stop your thought at that point, he still had to go with the thought. 
[01:25:00]  He's back up again for the injured Clay Conjury.  Hey, Retro Night, that was a great tune just then.  That was Rock Around the Cock by...  Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley and the Commons.  Bill Haley from Chester PA.  Rock Around the Cock.  Oops.  Whoopsie.  What do you got, Sam?  Oh, really?  Really?  Oh, Sam's just come in with a tidbit, Diddy?  This can't be good.  By the way, DJ Scribble's coming in today. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, I see a lot of equipment here.  He's going to spin live for us.  I hear he does some really...  Are these now real, authentic turntables?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  Can you do a little something-something?  Yeah, I can.  No, does he use those digital discs and then has a computer, or is it actual LPs?  Well, it looks that way because the vinyls that he has up on the turntables right now,  those are those time-coded discs.  Yeah, yeah, like the Drew Boogie thing.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's probably going to be the same thing. 
[01:26:00]  All righty.  Cool.  That is a miracle of modded technology, my friend, how they figured that one out.  Sam, you brought in the monster...  And you see the monster can.  Yeah, yeah, the monster can.  The inflated, oversized monster can.  That takes up a lot of room in a small office.  Why is there so much merchandising in our office that isn't ours?  Well, it's got to go with the monster cooler and the four cases of monster energy drinks.  Oh!  All right.  And this leads to Sam's backstage with O&A. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and it was brought up on the Opie and Anthony show  that executive producer Steve C. is faking sick and taking days off like there's no tomorrow.  We went to Steve himself to get to the bottom of things.  Steve, the guys say that you take too many sick days.  What's going on?  I know you think I'm faking it, but believe me, it would be a lot easier just to call out 
[01:27:00]  than to fucking orchestrate an elaborate scheme.  Why is your immune system so weak?  AIDS.  Do you think you're taking more sick days than anybody else?  Not at all.  No more sick days than anyone else?  Apparently, Opie and Anthony's opinion of the days Steve takes off are skewed.  We found the Opie and Anthony interns and asked all of them who takes the most sick days.  Who do you think takes the most sick days out of the O&A staff?  So far, definitely Steve. 
[01:27:30]  I think Steve.  That would be Steve Carlisi.  Probably Steve.  I'd say Steve.  Steve?  I would say probably Steve Carlisi.  A room full of idiot interns can't be wrong.  Why is Steve faking sick every day?  Has the pressure finally gotten to him?  Luckily for us, Steve being absent from the show has literally no effect on how it sounds.  Feel better, Steve.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with O&A. 
[01:28:00]  Backstage with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  I could do a do-over.  I don't care.  You want to do a do-over?  Do-over.  Do-over, come back.  You want to do a do-over?  From our break.  Well, we've got DJ Scribble in studio, and I want to hear what he's capable of doing here.  You want to try it again?  Do-over.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going to turn your mic is now off.  I totally like that.  Yeah, but it's a little different than the original Black Sabbath that you're used to. 
[01:29:00]  Generals gathered in their masses  Just like witches at black masses  Evil minds that pluck destruction  Forcerer of death's construction  In the fields of bodies burning  As the war machine keeps turning 
[01:29:30]  Death and hatred to mankind  Poisoning their brainwashed minds  Oh, Lord, yeah  Oh  Oh  Come on  Oh  Oh  Come on  Oh  Oh  Come on  Oh 
[01:30:00]  Oh  Come on  Come on  Come on  Come on  Come on 
[01:30:30]  Thank you  Thank you  Packing, asking who wanted  Did that nigga flaunt it  That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it  Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, can't you see  Sometimes your words just hypnotize me  And I just love your flashy ways  This is why you're broken, you're so paid 
[01:31:00]  Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, can't you see  Sometimes your words just hypnotize me  And I just love your flashy ways  This is why you're broken, you're so paid  Oh, that was me and Dave Navarro, by the way  That was Dave Navarro?  On the guitar, yeah  Wow, DJ Scribble in-house  Yeah, we're having a little technical difficulties  But I'll figure it out by the next break  For some reason this ain't working the way it was last night  Oh really?  Yeah, I don't know what happened  You played it off well though  I was like, why can't I scratch right now? 
[01:31:30]  I'm like, what the hell's going on?  But I'll fix it  Alright, it still sounded good to me  I was scared to turn it off  I didn't know what was going to happen if I turned it off  Yeah man, me and Dave Navarro got together  And we decided to put a whole mash-up thing together  And just combine what we both do  Him coming from rock and roll  And me coming from hip-hop and dance  And just pretty much getting together  And having a lot of fun with it  And touring around the world with it  And just like taking records like  Rage Against the Machine public service announcement  And mixing it with  I mean, Rage Against the Machine 
[01:32:00]  Killing the name of it  And then mixing it with Jay-Z  Public service announcement  But going in and actually redoing the entire record  So all the guitar licks, everything's Dave  Wow, I gotta hear that Rage Against the Machine  Yeah, I'm gonna play that, definitely  A little later, right?  Yeah, absolutely  And you're from Long Island?  Queens and Long Island  Yeah, yeah, okay  I graduated from Sawanica in Long Island  Wow, and you've worked with everybody  Yeah, I've been everybody from Biggie to Madonna to  You knew Biggie?  I was one of Biggie's first DJs  It was me, Puffy, and Mark Pitts 
[01:32:30]  Going around to Checkers restaurants  When I was at Hot 97  Doing the morning show  And doing the openings of like  Checkers fast food restaurants  Before Biggie even had an album out  Wow  Yeah, it's crazy  I did a bunch of shows with them  It was awesome  I'm trying to think what we could ask them  About Biggie  Oh, did you like the movie?  Yeah, the movie was good  You did like it?  I liked it  I think they did a really good job with it  I mean, the timeline pretty much  Was right on the money  I thought, you know  The kid that played Biggie 
[01:33:00]  I mean, I don't know what other movie  He's gonna do  Because now he's forever Biggie  But, you know, I think he did a really good job  And I got to go to the premiere  And we were all there and stuff  So it was pretty cool  That's awesome  Was everybody who was portrayed in the movie happy?  Or I heard a few people didn't quite  Oh, no, I didn't hear that  Who wasn't happy?  I heard, what the fuck is her name?  I think Little Kim  Oh, she was  I don't know  I think the girl that played Little Kim was  Ridiculous, right?  Jesus Christ  Did you guys see that?  My movie's a good movie  That one scene was a little 
[01:33:30]  Oh, when she's riding him?  Oh, my God  Jesus Christ, dude  It's fucking ridiculous  I'm like sitting in a movie theater  Like, God damn  Yeah, it's like  They can get away with that  Is it still rated R?  Yeah  No, it's pretty insane  That was pretty hot  That was pretty hot  I see that one, shit  I'm looking at some of, like  The bullet points for DJ Scribble  And we got something in common with him  Oh, yeah, what's that?  I just realized  Well, we worked with Tracy  Oh, Tracy Clarity  Yeah, we worked with her  Yeah  I was there with her  With Hot 97  From, like, 94 to 98  And they brought her over to K-Rock 
[01:34:00]  When we were over there  She fired me, actually  Oh, really?  Yeah, well, because I won the DJ championship  Yeah  Like, they picked all the best DJs  From around the country  As far as radio DJs go  And it was, like, this big DJ battle  And I ended up being the guy for Hot 97  Because Fleck couldn't do all the tricks  And stuff like that  Right  So they picked me  And then I won the whole thing  And then two weeks later  They fired me  Because they couldn't have me be bigger than Fleck's  Jesus Christ  Is that a true story?  Yes, true story  I swear to God  And then I thought my career was over  And I was, like, hysterical 
[01:34:30]  Like, in tears  Like, talking  Crying to my manager  Like, how could they do this to me?  And then three weeks later  I was on MTV  And I was like, peace  All right, see you later  Hey, what was Biggie like  Back during, like, those struggling days?  Did he just know he was going to hit?  You know, he just had this persona about him  That when he walked into a room  I mean, first of all  He was one of the funniest guys  I ever met in my life  He was just hysterical  He was always cracking jokes and everything  But he was, like, this big, huge teddy bear  That just was humble  When he was off the stage  And just doing what he  Doing him and stuff 
[01:35:00]  But when he just got on that mic  It was just this whole other person  Came out of him  It was insane, bro  Do you guys ever see that YouTube video of him  From way back  Where he's just battling some guy in Brooklyn  And he just was  I guess he was always good  He fucking destroys this guy  This guy's, like, walking down the block  He's still talking about him  And everybody's going crazy  Fucking spinning their towels and shit  It's awesome  Yeah, biggies  Is it worth playing on the radio?  You know what?  I think the audio's a little  A little bad  It's a little hard  Yeah  It's more like a visual thing 
[01:35:30]  You can tell he's killing him  By people's reactions around him  Sure  Going, oh!  Yeah  That's what you know  Because so many people today  You know, you can suck  And you get in a studio  And they can  Even if you can't sing or whatever  But you can just  The guy's literally standing on a street corner  Sure  Destroying this guy  Yeah, that's what all the auto-tune  All that auto-tune shit is now, too  It's fucking annoying as hell  You don't like the auto-tune?  Dude, if I hear  If Roger Zapp did it way back in the days  God bless him  And you know, dead Roger Zapp  Computer love  Old funk 
[01:36:00]  You'd know it if you heard it  You'd know it if you heard it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You got that, Travis?  I think the first one that really  Was really popular  Was Cher doing it  Everybody knew that one  Yeah, Cher did it as well  But they were doing it before Cher?  Because that's when I  Is it the same thing like Peter Frampton did?  No, that's the  TalkBox  Yeah, but that was fucking great in the 70s  We didn't like that  We didn't mind it  Here's that song that DJ Scribble's talking about 
[01:36:30]  So this was the first auto-tune song?  Not the first one, but he  They did it first  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I hear you  I don't know this  I don't know this one either  They got a different one that was more  It was like real big on the West Coast  Yeah, that's the only reason why I ever heard this  Because L.A. still plays this stuff  Like it came out last week  Exactly  Well, Tupac did it with California, right? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah  That's auto-tune  Absolutely  Yeah, now people are just sick of it  What made people sick of it?  What, that everybody and their mother's doing it now?  Even if you can't sing?  I mean, you got artists out there that are just fucking  Jamie Foxx  I didn't say that  Are you friends with him?  Yeah, I know Jamie for a long time  I mean, come on  No, I just think  Listen, it's a crutch  That's why I'm loving that  Jay-Z came out with D.O.A.  Which is called Death of Auto-Tune  His new single  Which just abuses everybody for using it 
[01:37:30]  Oh, there you go  Yeah, so it's dope  I just don't  Yeah, listen, why did Kanye West  He was doing great  And then he did a whole album with that stuff, right?  Yeah, he did all the auto-tune stuff, too  It's like, whatever  I'm like, I can't  You know what it is?  Because, like, there's so much non-talent now coming out  Especially in hip-hop  And, God, that's where I started  You know, I started DJing in 1980  And I've been with, you know, Grandmaster Flash  And Africa Band  1980? How old were you?  12 when you started? 
[01:38:00]  11  Jesus Christ  You were going for the joke  But he really was 11 or 12  Yeah, I was 11 years old  Jesus  Wow  So, I've been DJing a long time, man  I've been doing this  I mean, I've done every  You know, I was into B-Boy  So, what point did you actually have  Like, your career was going?  14  I was in a group called  The Young Black Teenagers  Produced by Public Enemy  We were an all-white rap group  Called Young Black Teenagers  And that's how I toured around  That was my college  Touring around the world  With Public Enemy  Doing  I was like one of the first dudes  To actually DJ with a rock group 
[01:38:30]  You know, we did the sisters  So you were getting like  Groupie pussy at like 15  There's no way you finished high school  You must have been like  No, I finished high school  Really?  I got accepted to  Pratt University School of Visual Arts  And FIT  I was an art major  That's how I got the name Scribble  I used to deface public property  And bomb trains  Oh, the old school  Like, yeah  The old Death Wish days  I was a real, real  I was a real, real B-Boy  Like, that's what I did  Like, I was a real, real B-Boy  What does that mean?  What does bomb a train mean?  What does B-Boy mean? 
[01:39:00]  I used to do  I used to do graffiti on trains  But I did not  Yeah, we called it bomb  But I didn't do just like  Throw-ups  Which were called  Like, just those ugly ones  I used to do full murals  And stuff like  Yeah, what's up with the ugly graffiti?  I hate  Yeah, just the tagging and stuff  I never really did that  Some of the stuff is really cool  To check out  But that ugly  But if you're going to do  Something like that  What time of night  Do you have to start?  It was all different times  We used to go to the  Baychester layup  Which was in the Bronx  To hit the twos and fives  We used to go there  At like three o'clock 
[01:39:30]  In the afternoon  On a Sunday  How long would it take you  To paint something like that?  Depends on what we were doing  And how intricate  Everything could have been  From an hour to six hours  You ever have a great idea  And you got halfway through it  And then some security  Chased you out of there  And you're like  Fuck!  Well  To see how stupid we were  I gotta find that train again  Yeah, no  To see how stupid we were  When we were kids  Like if you go to the  Halsey Street layup  Which was in Queens  And on the borderline of Brooklyn  You used to have to crawl  Hide underneath the park train  Because you were on a live track  On both sides  Where the trains were coming in 
[01:40:00]  Jesus Christ  Yeah, we would  So would you pop out  When the trains aren't running?  Yeah, then we'd hide underneath  I got zapped by the third rail once  And it's not  You don't die  When you get zapped by the third rail  If you just touch it  You get really messed up  And can't walk for about two hours  Oh, we got a good clip of a guy  Doing that in India  And you used to have to hide  Under the trains  And then we'd come back out  And then  But we've been chased  I've been chased  Wait a minute  You can touch the third rail?  I did it  And you just get the most incredible  Hardcore  Yeah, I would think so 
[01:40:30]  Hurtful jolt  Of you've ever gotten in your life  As long as you ain't in water  And you know  I just, you know  Got off it real quick  But I couldn't move  For like two hours  I thought the second you touch that  You can't move  And you just  You catch on fire  No, if you get stuck to it  And you burn yourself  And you die  Yeah, of course  And you die  Yeah, then you're dead  Then you're dead, of course  Jesus Christ  What was the most dangerous  Graffiti you did?  When we got chased out of  Baychester one day  By another rival crew with guns  And they're shooting at us 
[01:41:00]  Why does it always end up  With the guns?  It's hip-hop  It wouldn't be hip-hop  If it wasn't a gun  Yeah, it's hilarious  It's what we do  Can't you guys just  It ain't hip-hop  Without a gunshot  Throw hands  That's why every show  No one goes to the range  And learns how to fucking aim  Yeah, no  We got chased by another rival crew  And they were shooting at us  And we ran the hell out of there  You ever get shot?  No  Thank God  Never been shot  Yeah, that's not a good thing  No, being shot would be bad  Have your fucking red spray paint can 
[01:41:30]  Go off on you  And go  Ah, I'm hit  I'm hit  The night I got  Actually, the night I got arrested  Which was the only time in my life  Which was for graffiti  And it was already where  I shouldn't have been doing it  And I was a grown-up  And I was already in the rap group  Hanging out  Yeah, I was like 22 already  23  And I was already in the group  And we were on tour  But we had like this whole big graffiti  Reunion  And I went to the 111th Street layup  On Jamaica Avenue  Was this a sting by the police?  Yes, it was  Ah, you knew it 
[01:42:00]  And I was with like 13 other people  I was with 13 other dudes  Bombing the trains  And then we're walking out  And they yoked me up  And I was the only one that got caught  And got charged with all 12 cars  And what happened was  Just like you said  A can of red paint  Exploded all over me  Because it was cold  And we were doing  The police were doing a shift change  So they walked me  And I looked  Had my hair  And I lost my hat  And I have all this red paint over  And I have 13 cops escorting me  Because they were shift changing 
[01:42:30]  And all these people  Walking through the train station  Like I was this murderer  You got paint all over you  Did you still go with the  I didn't do nothing  I didn't do nothing  Dude, I had my hair  Prove it  I never want to ever be in jail  I never  That was my lesson  Never do anything bad  Ever again after that  Oh yeah, all that shit is  How long were you in?  I was in for two days in QCB  Because I got caught on a Friday  So they didn't arraign me till Sunday  And then I had to do like  What did you see in jail?  In those two days  I had to use the bathroom  And hold it  Because there was a 350 pound woman 
[01:43:00]  In the other cell  Where I would have to  Go to the bathroom  And I couldn't do it  In front of her  And she was just watching me  Like staring at me  Like she wanted to eat me  And I was just like  No, absolutely not  And I would never go  Yeah, I've never understood that  And that was just in central booking  You know, so I was like  I'll never want to go do this again  You ever see like  One of those big holding cells  And they'll just have one toilet  Like sitting there  Like where that chair is  It's like  What if I have to take a shit?  Yeah  Yeah, that's exactly what  She was watching  She's sitting there  And there's the toilet 
[01:43:30]  And she's watching me  And I was like  I held it for two days  Do you have to be like  Hey guys, sorry about this  Yeah, exactly  I held it for two days, dude  I was like  I can't do this  No way  It's not happening  Wow  Unbelievable  Yeah, it was ridiculous  And we have someone  Someone else in common  Who's that?

[01:50:00]  To go perform for the troops  I was in Dubai in October  And I ended up doing the USS Ronald Reagan  On a whim  I was out there on vacation  And I ran into these three kids  That looked like they were American  I was with my wife  And I was like  Yo where are you guys from  And they're like  Oh we're in the Navy  We're from Florida  I was like  Oh yeah what ship  And they're like  The USS Ronald Reagan  And I just was like  What  They're like  You're Scribble right  And I'm like  Yeah how the hell you know that  You know  They follow me whatever  And I was like  Yo man  They're like  You want to see the ship  I was like  If you can get me on that ship  I'll do a show for you guys 
[01:50:30]  Because I have my stuff with me  So I got a call from the USO  Two hours later  I'm on a military transport  Out to the ship  And I was performing  For 5500 Navy troops  Which was the illest  Most incredible gig of my life  What was the coolest part  Of the ship  When I got to sit  In the admiral's chair  And then the admiral  Actually came down  And gave me the hat  That you can only get  From the admiral  And the little coin  And stuff  Which was a real honor for me  And then  I'm getting ready  To go to Iraq  And go to like  All the bases in Iraq  And Afghanistan  And perform for them 
[01:51:00]  And you were in Dubai  You said  Yeah I was in Dubai  How ridiculous is that place  Thank God  Thank God you get to  Leave your records at home  Exactly  New technology  It's so ridiculous  It's the building  But from what I understand now  They ran out of money  And they're trying  A lot of investors  Have now pulled out  Of Dubai?  Yes  A lot of investors  Have pulled out  And they're only  They're not even  Three quarters of the way  Done building  I mean  85% of the world's  Largest cranes  Are in Dubai right now  Building this place up  It's like  The most incredible  Fairy tale land  You've ever seen 
[01:51:30]  I love it  Yeah  It's been planned  I love it  So you know  Fucking evil place  Over there  They got those little  Islands  Shaped like  Every country out there  It's like  What sort of  New world order  Crap is going on  That place was a  Junkyard  Five years ago  There's no way  That's honest money  I don't give a fuck  What you invented  You don't have enough  Money to build  An indoor mountain  That you can ski on  In the middle east  That's crazy  Yeah  The indoor ski resort  They're building  The first  NASCAR  They were 
[01:52:00]  Building the first  NASCAR track  Out of the United States  How did they run out of money?  I don't know  A lot of investors  Pulled out  Like each  The way the city's set up  It's like taking  Five Manhattans  And putting them  In different sections  So there's like  Media  TV city it's called  Then there's fun city  Which they put  In the universal studios  Six flags  Like then they have  The sports city  With the world's  Largest sockets  Everything is so  Excess and over the top  It's like west world  You guys ever see that  Yes exactly  It's like that  Exactly  And are these real islands 
[01:52:30]  Or is that bullshit  No they  What they do  Is they go  And they drudge up  All these  All the sand  From in the lagoon  And they start  Shooting it  And build the island  Out of the sand  And then build  On top of that  But they make weird shapes  That sounds safe  Yeah one's a palm  One's the shape  Of a palm  Palm tree  And the other ones  The other ones  Are going to be  The actual map  Of the world  Yeah  And then they're  Building a new  Big palm tree too  Like we stayed  In that sale hotel  The Alaburge  And we're watching  Them build it  Every morning  It's crazy dude

[01:55:30]  Damn, DJ Scribble doing that live for us.  That's pretty fucking amazing.  I got to be honest.  I never know what the hell's going on. 
[01:56:00]  Like, I don't understand how the whole thing works.  Like, there's two turntables going.  And a microphone.  And then you turn the other thing on.  So what is the one on your right?  That's just playing the track?  That's playing the track, and then the one on the left was the one I was scratching on.  Scratching, and then what you...  That's the mixer in the middle that controls the whole thing.  Oh, now I get it.  Bill, can you switch back and forth?  Bill, give it a try.  No.  No.  No.  So, yeah, it's another one that we went in, and me and Dave went in and redid, you know, 
[01:56:30]  beautiful people from Marilyn Manson.  That's very cool.  Let's go to Michael.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, I was in Dubai for some bullshit work thing last month.  And, yeah, that place, it's not quite falling apart, but, like, Western workers are fleeing because if you lose your job, your visa expires in a week or you get arrested.  Ah, nice.  Some of the man-made islands are apparently sinking a little bit.  Oh, that's fantastic.  All the construction is just ground to a halt. 
[01:57:00]  Like, you see these huge buildings.  The world's tallest building.  I was there for four days.  No one was working on it.  Yeah, no, it's crazy.  Everything has just stopped.  Now, I believe you, but I want to know why.  They just gave up.  Like, is it because of...  They're saying that they, excuse me, ran out of money in the sheets.  I thought they were the last place that was going to run out of money.  I mean, we understand what's going on in America, but I didn't know, you know, it was affecting the Dubai.  Well, you know, there's no infrastructure.  All the building that was going on, there's no infrastructure at all. 
[01:57:30]  Like, the plumbing and all that stuff, they didn't, like, put that into the plan.  Like, all this beautiful stuff, but there's no infrastructure in the city.  Infrastructure, you mean plumbing?  Plumbing.  Like, it's fucked up, bro.  So you can't, if you live on the 70th floor, you've got to open a window.  I don't know how it works, but they didn't plan for any of that.  They just built.  You just take a dump down this garbage chute.  Oh, I see.  So it's like they have all these sump trucks that pump out everything, but it's starting to become too much, and they can't keep up with the sewage. 
[01:58:00]  They don't have any sewage drainage.  I get it.  I get it.  So you can flush the toilet, but you walk out to your car, and you're like, oh, that's what I just shit out of me.  Exactly.  That's hilarious.  I know there's a bunch of people over here that thought that that was going to be the next big thing, so they went and they bought, like, these million-dollar...  Right, and a lot of these investors have now pulled out, and now the Sheik is trying to kick everybody out of the country now, too.  Like, it's just they're closing the doors.  And plus, it's just... 
[01:58:30]  It's half done, and that's it.  It's half done.  He was literally...  He was literally...  That's great.  Yeah, the whole project wasn't supposed to be done until 2018.  That's when it was supposed to be totally finished.  And from what I understand now, it ain't happening.  Wow.  That guy was literally...  The head dude over there was literally on 60 Minutes, not more than a year and a half ago.  And they were just...  It was a nice fluff piece.  Other than when they exposed the people who were building, you know, how they were treating them.  But he was just like, you know, everything's going to be the biggest, and everything's going to be the greatest.  They had people working 24 hours a day from... 
[01:59:00]  Most of them were Indian workers from India.  A street viewer there, Danny?  24 hours a day around the clock.  Wow.  Steven in Florida.  Steven.  Yeah, I worked out in Dubai.  I was an engineer at an airport out there, and the place is disgusting.  They have these environmental effect rules that say that because it's so windy and dusty out there that every crane has got to have, like, water, like, pouring down to keep all the dust settled.  So you've got a 400-ton crane with a garden hose sitting on top of it. 
[01:59:30]  A garden hose.  Placing water out, doing absolutely nothing.  Wow.  The Palm Island, there's no irrigation, so the water gets inside the leaf and just sits there and gets stagnant.  They've got to...  Who knows how many millions of dollars.  They've got to do piping between them.  Oh, you can see, like...  I'm looking at the Palm right now.  Yeah, the Palm Island.  And you can see, like, water, yeah, it's sitting in there, but there's no real way for the natural tides and waves to kind of... 
[02:00:00]  Move it around.  Move it around, so that water just stagnates in there.  It's just sitting there, and it's boiling.  That's hilarious.  All the construction stopped.  They knew they were running.  They knew that oil wouldn't last forever, so they wanted to make Dubai someplace else to come to.  Even if they didn't have oil, they said, well, we're going to make the next big tourist hotspot.  And it's all just...  It'll just become a movie set for old post-apocalyptic fucking war movies. 
[02:00:30]  They're going to do Waterworld 8, man.  Yeah, Waterworld Part 2.  And fucking Mad Max 8.  Just fucking have a pisser.  That's funny.  So you could see that Palm, like, just looking at that, as a layman, you could go, that's got to be trouble.  That's got to cause problems.  I got to be honest.  That never dawned on me that that would be a problem.  Rob in Toronto.  Rob.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Rob.  Hey there, Rad.  Sorry.  I have a feeling that it's a thing that's happening with a lot of countries that do, that have oil producing properties, I guess, 
[02:01:00]  is that in order to maintain these projects, the oil price has got to be up to a certain level.  If not, it's not worth it for them to keep on going.  So Saudi Arabia and all these guys that have, like, projects have to have the oil price above, like, $99 a barrel or something like that.  And it's affecting stuff over here in Canada, even.  Wow. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know why that's just so funny to me.  It really is funny.  It is funny because there's a bunch of people that thought they were...  Can you get a list of, like, celebrities who've bought places over there?  Because I heard a number of them.  Yeah, there's a few people over there.  We're piling on.  Supposedly the guy working the crane for the world's tallest building has lived in it for the last year.  It's too much of a hassle to come down from it.  Because I guess there's no elevators or anything.  Are you serious?  Is that real?  This guy swears it's true.  Chris C. from Virginia.  Thank you, Rob.  No problem.  Have a great show. 
[02:02:00]  Thanks a lot.  All right.  A couple people asking where they could get your stuff, DJ.  It's in the stores right now.  The new album is actually coming out July 23rd.

[02:09:30]  I will give them the one of the Jews  let's wait on this one though  we'll wait another 10 years or so  because  dude nobody could survive  like just the shit I say  walking around in my apartment to myself  I wouldn't want recorded  this guy thought it was a great idea  to have microphones  all over the fucking White House  and just record everything he said  did he ever just sing like  random like vulgar songs  that he makes up  that's what I do  you light up my life 
[02:10:00]  you get on the couch  you fucking cunt  you Jew  where's Ben Stein  my Jew speech writer  used to write speeches for him  you know Ben Stein  that's basically his claim to fame  oh is that right  my Jew  write me something  the Jews are like Ben  write me something  that Israel will embrace me for  so Henry can go over there  and make me friends with the Jew  do you know I read something about Nixon one time 
[02:10:30]  you know how they  you know those  FDR  JFK  LBJ  he wanted to be known as that  so he started referring to himself as RN  and it didn't  what about RMN  Milhouse was my middle name  RN  Milhouse  nurse  yeah  I'm an RN  that's not too tough  Nurse Jackie  holla  anyone  no  alright  huh  you like the Nurse Jackie  it's alright right 
[02:11:00]  you know you're Nixon  she's popping pills  and fucking snorting shit  and fucking doctors  and taking care of patients  it's what's her name  from the Sopranos  you know Anthony  you're Nixon  and you're Vince McMahon  are  yeah  right on  yes  let's get into the Nixon tapes  Nixon's  Nixon tapes reveal  abort stunner  yes  Washington 
[02:11:30]  President Richard Nixon  saw abortion  oh boy  as a useful option  for ending  mixed race  pregnancy  yes  mixed race  newly released tapes  yesterday's show  where are the tapes  we gotta hear this  there's transcripts  I think you could  listen to the tapes  somewhere else  but yeah  maybe just hearing it  in his own voice  is just too much  for people to handle  this guy was our president  yeah  Henry 
[02:12:00]  Henry  look  where's the Hoover  I need  the government  to back Hoover  vacuums  so that one  of colored  impregnates  a white girl  we could just  suck out the fetus  is this on  is my recording device on  because I want to go down  in history  as being  the guy  the president  that came up  with this great idea  you know  Kennedy  got credit  for a lot of things  and I want credit 
[02:12:30]  for making sure  swuggies  and white people  never get together  suck it out  Hank  suck it out  get Ben Stein  my Jewish speech writer  I want to hit  the press room  with this abortion  colored white thing  I'm going to be a hero  to the white community  the vast  silent majority  that wants  abortions  for whitey  and blacky  I don't think 
[02:13:00]  that's a very good idea  Richard  why do you say  shut up Jew  and get me a vacuum  a carpet sleeper  if you can't find it  Mr. Nixon  are you only going to use  vacuum cleaners  no  hangers  hangers  plenty of hangers  rattle them around in there  mix it up  and make it come out  I'll be a hero  they'll get statues  toward me  no half-breeds  no melatos 
[02:13:30]  I don't like melatos  I'll grab like  the Lincoln Memorial  they'll be the Nixon Memorial  showing little  aborted fetus parts  all at my feet  of various colors  he thought it was  a viable idea  amazing  let me run this  past you Hank  what do you say  we abort  half black baby  well  Richard  Nixon 
[02:14:00]  said  there are times  when abortions  are necessary  I know that  Nixon told  Charles Coulson  on January 23rd  1973  that's the thing  about a black  and a white  Nixon explained  in the secretly  recorded conversation  or a rape  same thing  same kind of thing  if it's a rape  it was probably  a black  on a white  they'll build  statues  to RN  RNN  Richard 
[02:14:30]  Milhouse  Nixon  write me a speech  it'll be great  fuck Vietnam  this is where  I'll be known for  pieces of children  with honor  see that's a twist  on peace with honor  no  nothing  too smart  too smart  for the room  same kind of thing  you know what I mean  there are times  Nixon told his  his aide in a hideaway  next door to the  White House  what was the hideaway  next door to the  White House  that was what I was  able to say 
[02:15:00]  Jew  I was able to  blurt out  all kinds of  horrible things  the n-word  and I don't mean  Nixon  Nixon  the n-word  you fucking  Nixon  Nixon did not  elaborate on  whether he  actually favored  ending  interracial  pregnancies  or was simply  acknowledging  the prevalent  social stigma  of that era 
[02:15:30]  about black  and white  couples  I don't even  like seeing  them hold  hands  I'm for chopping  their hands  off if they're  holding hands  pissing  pull their  tongues out  baby  Cuisinart  Jesus Christ  we don't need  a nation  of mongrels  do we  let me  let me  what does  Spiro Agnew  think of this  Spiro  what do you  oh he's just 
[02:16:00]  evading taxes  the 37th  president  did not  foretell  in the  150 hours  of recordings  released  150 hours  by his  library  so they  released  another  150 hours  yeah  oh so  there's gonna  be more  tidbits  in the  coming  days  what do  we do  about  the  homos  gotta do  something  about  the  homos  they're  losing  the war  in the  non  for us  it's  the  homos  here  this is  this paragraph 
[02:16:30]  the 37th  president  did not  foretell  in the  150 hours  of recordings  released  by his  library  however  that the  44th  president  might be  just such  a child  born of  a white  mother  and black  father  president  Obama  was 11  when Nixon  was caught  on tape  11 years  too late  for me  I guess  I'm Richard  Nixon  remember  that  everyone  listening  remember  I'm Richard  Milhouse  Nixon  and I'm 
[02:17:00]  a horrible  person  with horrible  ideas  do you  understand  what I'm  saying  Mr.  President  Mongo  has a  question  for you  yes  Mongo  did RN  stand for  remove  negroes  yes  Richard  Nixon  remove  negroes  why did  he do  why did  he record  what was  he trying  to prevent  he was  crazy  he was  insane  the guy  was  fucking  nuts  and he 
[02:17:30]  recorded  everything  because he  actually  thought  that if  anything  happened  his recordings  would vindicate  him  and make  him look  like  the good  guy  if anyone  ever tried  to pull  shenanigans  on him  because he  always thought  that people  were trying  to pull  shit on  him  which they  were  but the  tapes  are anything  but a  vindication  holy shit  wow  hey  let's see  what else  this says  Nixon discussed  his abortion  views while  otherwise  lamenting 
[02:18:00]  the Supreme  Court's  landmark  Roe vs.  Wade decision  that day  which legalized  abortion  yes  to Nixon's  mind  underage girls  might be  encouraged to  quit using  birth control  and go get  knocked up  because of  the high  court's  ruling  he said  oh that's  hot  stop using  birth control  Henry  Henry  get that  speech writer  Jew friend  of yours  write something  out about  young girls  not being  protected  and getting  abortions  and having  sex with 
[02:18:30]  the negroes  this will be  a good  distraction  for me  bombing the  fuck out  of Cambodia  and what would  the monument  look like  again  it would be  a big statue  of R.N.  Richard Nixon  with baby  parts  marble baby  parts all  over  the show  and people  would pay  tribute to  me  you could use  the Washington  monument to  help with  the abortions  oh exactly  I could make  it look like  a big abortion  vacuum  yeah people 
[02:19:00]  forget about  the Ho Chi Minh  trail and  think about  the old  Moana baby  trail  distractions  our fetuses  bombed  like Cambodia  escalate  yes  we must  escalate  withdraw troops  and withdraw  mulatto babies  you know  it's fucking  the guy's  the guy's  completely out  of his mind  but he still  became president 
[02:19:30]  even though  he's actually  credited I think  with one of the  biggest comebacks  in politics  where he lost  the election  to Kennedy  and then  damn not  Kennedy  he liked  the colored  I don't  never did  never trusted  them  Kennedy trusted  them  look what it  got him  a bullet  in the head  you're still  Richard Nixon  right  you're still  Richard Nixon  of course I am  I'll be with  Richard as long 
[02:20:00]  as I speak  into this bullhorn  I'm old  RN  this is parody  get it  I love this  song  reminds me  when I was  a door gunner  in the NAR  I never was  but it reminds  me  that guy  was a pip  he had  microphones  like in  paintings  and desks  and everywhere 
[02:20:30]  in the fucking  White House  and some of  the stuff  like the  anti-Semitic  shit he did  with Henry  Kissinger  right there  he's telling  Henry Kissinger  about the Jews  like Henry  Kissinger  doesn't know  like what  Jews are  and like  where they live  and what  they're dealing  with  I like this  one  who was the  colored gentleman  that did this  Jimmy Hendrix  died of a drug  overdose  terrible thing  if you're a fan 
[02:21:00]  of the Richard  Nixon tapes  we're gonna go  way back  around 10  10 10  oh wow  we're gonna play  two classics  classic  from the  WNEW days  love it  hey can you  where can you 
[02:21:30]  listen to those  150  can I download  that on iTunes  I want every  bit of that  I want every  second of those  tapes  those are what  PDF files though  I think those  are um  nah  there's links  to the audio  as well  oh  unfortunately  the descriptions  aren't so great  so it's kind of  you're not  entirely sure  what you're getting  but all the  mp3s are there  if you're getting  kooky  give me a bacon  egg and cheese  yes  yeah you just  go to  you want some  outrageous recording  it's just like 
[02:22:00]  oh  the old  bitch is up  again  make me breakfast  and then just  him asleep on the  chair  Henry you woke me  up you scared me  what's going on  in Hanoi  by the way  you annoy me  it's a tricky  dicky joke  there you go  1010  this morning  we'll play more  Richard Nixon  nice  old school 
[02:22:30]  yeah  going back  way way back  we could segue  into this  if Richard Nixon  is still around  this is from a  1980s  I had the  shingles for a while  remember when I  got the shingles  no I don't remember  never knew what that  was when I heard it  as a kid  now I'm me  talking like Nixon  through Nixon  channeling Nixon  I had the  shingles  1980s PBS show 
[02:23:00]  listen to this  sock it to me  sock it to the  fetus  I say  remember laughing  when I said  sock it to me  I want that  vagina to open up  like those  wacky doors  I'm laughing  and have a  bloody fetus  fly out  can you make  that happen  Henry  Ben get on it  write something  the Jews  are like  they support  me  because I hate  the Egyptians  because they're  close to  you know 
[02:23:30]  those people  I like that  oh a little  credence  credence  clear water  revival  there's a  bathroom on the  right  that's what it  sounds like  excuse me  while I kiss  this guy  homo  love the music  at the time  but it was  so weird  it ain't me  it ain't me  you ain't 
[02:24:00]  having a son  if it's half  black  from a 1980s  PBS show  listen to this  you look like  a boy  a little boy  a little black 
[02:24:30]  boy  everyone says  I look like  a black boy  you think I  look dumb too  don't you  no  you look sort  of like a  black person  oh go away  leave me alone  what the hell  was that  where's  where's Sam  what lesson  where's Sam  oh Sam  here he comes  here comes one  that would have  had a hanger  through his head  thank god  you were born  after Richard Nixon  exactly  you would have 
[02:25:00]  never made it  out alive  swear to you  you'd be in pieces  at my feet  at a monument  look at that hair  says it all  you have hanger  written all over  you  Henry  Henry  pull one of my  suits off a hanger  and get it quick  I don't think  it's too late  for this one  what did we  just hear there  Sam  well it's like  a PBS show  from the 80s  it's like a  like a drama  series 
[02:25:30]  and I think  it's almost like  in the vein  of the after school  special  ah  where it's you know  helps kids deal  with stuff and  everything  and this girl  gets a perm  this little white  girl gets a perm  and ends up  with her hair  in a tight  afro like  shortish looking  hairdo  like yours  like well  mine's a little  longer now  oh  shorter than her  shorter than yours  yeah  but like  just a little  afro  and so  I guess  the insult  that people  keep throwing  at her 
[02:26:00]  is that  she looks  like a black  boy  what year  is this from  it's from the 80s  I don't know  exactly which year  but it's  I don't remember  the 80s being  that crazy  like that  oh yeah  they were  yeah  were they  wow  people are racist  well  Billy said  I look like  a black boy  you look like  no such thing  it looks cute  it does not  oh come on  so it doesn't look cute  on a black boy  besides it's just a perm  your hair will grow again  and it's not like  you're really black  Jesus  are you kidding me 
[02:26:30]  holy shit  what is this from  1880  no 1980  what the fuck  what's it called  the name of the show  it's on the playlist  many voices  many visions  yes  wow  what were they trying  to teach  that it's  you know  tolerance  that's all they did  in 1980  the white people  don't need to feel  bad for themselves  because at least  they're not black  just kick her  out of the house  leave her  leave her at the foot  of my monument  just love the idea  of having a monument 
[02:27:00]  oh is that a picture  yeah see that's  a little girl  that's a girl  that's Billy  making fun of her  saying you  well her hair  does look stupid  but she doesn't look  like you either  she doesn't look  like a black  you look like  he looks like  he's claymation  yeah  that's a she  Jesus 
[02:27:30]  let's see what  everyone says  I look like  a black boy  you think  I look dumb too  don't you  no  you look sort of  like a black person  oh go away  leave me alone  Billy said  I look like  a black boy  you said  I look like  a black person  I stay with you  when you have  the chicken pox  you don't have  the chicken pox  you look like  a black person  holy mother of god  see it's racist  people  I cannot believe  what was the purpose 
[02:28:00]  of that  you know what  probably happened  was that they  had to have  a character  that moved  to town  who was black  and then she  understood  what he was  going through  being isolated  right  but let's look  at that  she grew her  hair longer  and made fun  of him  let's look  at that  last line  though  she's basically  saying that  being black  is way worse  than having  the chicken pox  oh hell yeah  that's what she  was saying  Jesus  chicken pox  you can get over  yeah  unbelievable  it didn't even  appear to be a show  on racism  it was just like  on how to deal  with the kids  making fun of you 
[02:28:30]  it just really  comes across  as not having  a purpose  except to say  black boy  yeah  a lot  it's really awful  wow  hmm  all right  that's  it was a bad  haircut  I will give her that  I would be crying  with that  although I think  that was my haircut  back in the  back in the day  I went to Disney  once with my parents  when I had  a huge afro  and I was probably  about nine years old  and this woman  black woman  that was working  the ride  she had a pretty 
[02:29:00]  big afro  and she goes  honey your natural  is bigger than mine  my natural  so she called it  a natural  black people  like my hair  of course they do  they've asked me  how do you get  your hair like that  have they asked you  to braid it  for you  oh yeah  oh yeah  of course  can you make  that video please  like where you like  snoop where half  of it's braided  oh dude  you need cornrows  I would do that  let's get someone  in here to braid it  let's braid half of it  you want to do that  we should do that  I want him to go  ghetto prom  let's ghetto prom it up  you know where it's like

So I'm a newbie, right?  But I'm not a divorcee, and everything I do is funky like lean tall sand.  Well, let's take it off the power of what you've reached. 
[02:33:00]  If you want to do the mind, you don't see me.  I got the self-awareness with the unique from it.  I keep it on and on, it's never been a promise.  Standing in the knees, loud and cold.  Never rock the bike, put the pantyhose.  And struck all my ear goggles, I'm ready to go.  I'm at the fortest, but then I'm going to burn and blow.  I'm at the flex, and then you know I'm cold, jacked.  All the body to live, and I'm on my phone, jacked.  I got my action, if a man tried to throw, and I got bad hits,  like I don't want to roll.  Secure your mind, you must stop. 
[02:33:30]  Secure your mind, and you don't stop.  Secure your mind, and you don't stop.  I'm at the front, and you don't get out.  Can I block me, or your eyes, or what's the entrance?  Listen, everybody, because I'm the shifting is.  I'm the trash, like doggy, when I get my specs in.  I'm the microphone, and I'm cold, jacked.  Talking like a cop, playing a rock, a hip-hop.  The top five trips, I'm talking to some vibes.  I don't put rocks, but they got great hits.  And that's just a lot, because they got machines.  I got a hole in my head, and there's no one,  the face I got to stage my throat.  I think you're too much, some shit is. 
[02:34:00]  Just things, things, things, things, things go out.  I got a rock, I got a rock, I got a rock, I got a rock.  I'm a red, blue, cherry, I'm very hot.  I'm rock the microphone, and then I'm going.  I'm like a four, the body.  I'm a jeep-switcher, never bad, so it's a legend.  계속 miRep COMING

[02:36:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:36:30]  According to DJ Times, I came in number three last year, and you can go to vote. 
[02:37:00]  Please vote djtimes.com forward slash best DJ.  And you can check me out on myspace.com, DJ ScribbleNY.  I would think that would get you a lot of free cocaine, that title.  Jason Ellison, studio.  Yeah, I do all right.  Yeah, you do all right.  You could probably get chicks to put ecstasy in your ass, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  You ever done that?  Is that better?  Is it better that way?  It is better that way.  Up the ass?  It is.  It's always better up the ass.  I've always said that.  No matter what it is.  No.  I have a t-shirt and a tattoo that says it. 
[02:37:30]  I stand by it.  It's always better up the ass.  I think that was a slogan for United Airlines back in 75 or something.  I think one of them was reading it to me on the plane last night.  It's fantastic.  Ecstasy up the ass.  DJ, any drugs up the ass there, DJ Scribble?  I've never done ecstasy up the ass.  You've never lived until you've chucked an e-bomber up your butt.  I've also said that before.  I heard it hits you a lot faster.  It does hit you a lot faster.  And when you do ecstasy, a lot of it, I always want to poo when I did ecstasy.  If you shove it up your ass, you don't want to shit because you know you're shit out your ecstasy. 
[02:38:00]  And it's like a mental thing where your ass goes, hmm, we're going up instead of out today.  Because the greatest feeling when the ecstasy kicks in, the greatest feeling is usually my fucking 45 seconds on the bowl taking a shit with my eyes rolling into the back of my head.  If you get somebody to shove it up your ass, then you get eyes rolling in the back of the head in the club with a chick on your dick.  You know what I mean?  That's the fucking...  Is the buzz different?  Not as heady? 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  I thought you were like a professional.  That was hilarious.  It's a little different.  It is a little different.  Yeah?  It is.  It comes on faster and I think it's strong.  You get more money, more bang for your buck, so to speak.  Wow.  Bill?  Ecstasy up your ass?  No, I haven't even taken it orally yet.  Really?  How old are you?  41.  Ah, too late.  You're done.  I like that.  It's like a bad thing.  Ah, you missed out on the ecstasy.  Messed it.  You can smoke the kid's marijuana these days.  The kid's marijuana will fucking trip your balls. 
[02:39:00]  It's no joke anymore.  Yeah.  It used to be smoke weed.  Go to the skate park and learn a new trick.  I smoke weed now and I'll fucking wake up out of a coma with my dick halfway in a chocolate cake.  Shit will fuck with your mind, dude.  In the old days, you just got a bag full of fucking shake and thought it was great stuff.  Yeah, no, Miss Mickey.  You roll a big fat joint.  You just smoke and go, yeah, I'm high.  Now it's like, it doesn't even look like pot anymore.  It looks like some kind of shit that turns into those bean pods that you fall asleep next to and get all fucked up. 
[02:39:30]  It's like an eight-headed fucking wildebeest.  With like veins in it that are actually pumping blood.  There's arteries in it.  It's pumping blood through the fucking butt.  It's Hulk weed.  Yeah.  You used to see LA now.  It's like Starbucks now.  Let me tell you a story about that.  Because you're talking to the guy who has the license who fucking goes there.  I'm old and I've got kids, so I'm not allowed to smoke weed anymore.  But I do from time to time because that's how I rebel and get connected to the kids.  Because I believe that the future needs to connect with the kids and the kids are high.  So I just do it for relating purposes. 
[02:40:00]  Of course.  Which is a lie.  I like marijuana.  But my whole life, I've wanted to do it legally.  In Amsterdam, I did it legally.  But you end up getting a blowjob from a hooker and it takes away from the excitement.  You do everything that's legal.  I mean, the whole fucking I got a doobie at the store after you just fuck five hookers  and you ask one of them to jack up in front of them for $7.50.  Shit starts to wear off about the marijuana.  Yeah.  But the marijuana now.  In LA, I go to a store.  I walk in and I go, because I'm 37.  I pay taxes. 
[02:40:30]  I'm not a millionaire, but I make all right money enough to walk in.  Instead of asking for a bag of marijuana, I say, I'll just take a pre-rolled.  And they're like, which one do you want?  Sativa or whatever.  Because there's different things that it'll do to your mind.  Because it's not the same anymore, man.  The things that it does to your mind.  But you can say, look, I want to fucking relax.  That's what I was getting to.  Oh, really?  It's designer shit?  Yeah.  Or you can say, I want to be creative.  Get the fuck out of here.  I swear to God, dude.  That's fucked up, man.  You're just going, I want to get creative.  They have one where you get high, but you don't get sleepy. 
[02:41:00]  They get rid of that hole getting sleepy.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Sativa.  All the medical weed.  You're going for it.  Your mind is shredding.  And these places are popping up all over California now, right?  There's no reason to buy illegal weed anymore.  That's the bad shit.  And all you have to do is get a note that says you got migraines or something, right?  That's it.  Well, I had, I mean, I've broken 25 bones or whatever, so I just showed the lady my ankles.  She was like, oh my God, you can hit your license.  Here you go, whatever you want.  Whatever you want.  Take whatever you want.  Please, just get out of here.  Put your shoes back on.  We're going to legalize this shit. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, it's going to be so awesome.  That's crazy.  Isn't that the greatest thing ever?  I think we should.  Everyone gets to drink.  There's fucking all you can drink in a bar, all different colors and different fucking  cans of shit for you, but you're not allowed to smoke a fucking joint.  Like, when was the last time someone smoked a joint and did something really bad?  Yeah, but that's because it's drugs.  That's true, yeah.  I mean, alcohol, it's pure.  Alcohol's a drug.  Wow.  That was such a fucking Ku Klux Klan comment.  No, I just like listening to people like, oh, he's flipping, alcohol's a drug too, man.  And they go up on that stuff.  I think, what are you talking about? 
[02:42:00]  I don't think alcohol, I think tobacco.  It's more dangerous.  If you make tobacco legal, then marijuana should be legal.  That's all I'm saying.  They should just legalize all of it.  Bill, you've been in some of these places?  No, no.  Because you don't really smoke pot.  No, I can't handle the fucking paranoia.  Do they have a, I'm not going to get paranoid.  No, they have an old, like, I'm just trying to get back into the game week.  Just for you.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell them.  Tell them.  What if I was never, I was never in the...  Fuck, I'm funny, I got kids in shape.  Don't fucking freak me out.  Give me some mellow juice.  Now you're talking my language, because I really, I think I want back in. 
[02:42:30]  Dude, I'm going to hook you up.  But I can't go back in with this crazy fucking over-the-top shit.  Dude, I'll hook you up with the lollipops.  They have lollipops that are lightweight shit.  Rogan does that.  And they barely do anything.  And if you're a rookie, or you're just getting back into the game, it's sufficient.  Same as they have...  I'm back in single A.  I'm single A ball right now.  Dude, that was my mistake.  I went to the Black Diamond.  Yeah, I know.  I went right back to the fucking Black Diamond.  Oh, you want to hear the Black Diamond?  I got the Black Diamond.  All right, let me...  Holy shit, am I fucked up.  It's like a hooker going back into the game with a 12-inch black cock. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, you gotta stretch that out slow.  You get fucked straight back out of the game, yeah.  You gotta stretch yourself, man.  I got high once, and I didn't like the whole smoke.  I just didn't like the feeling of that.  So then I tried.  I ate two and a half pot brownies, and I went to the airport.  Oh, huge mistake.  Went to the fucking airport, because I was flying to Costa Rica.  People can fly.  This is fucked up.  Dude, I was so freaked out.  I wanted to just stand up on the plane and admit to everything.  That's how fucking paranoid...  Eating, it's harder.  Eating, it makes you even higher.  I don't like that.  That's what I hear. 
[02:43:30]  But Anthony, you admitted on the show that he got back in the game, and it was just...  I did for a little while.  And it was crazy, right?  I would say for about a month.  Yeah.  The first time...  Hold on.  The first time he got high after all those years, what was it like?  Fucking great.  Fucking great.  But were you like...  Yeah.  But I was so fucked up.  Yeah.  And then after that, it started turning...  Isn't it always the way fucking great ends up being so fucked up?  So fucked up.  And then it got to the point where if you have a couple of beers...  Yeah.  ...and then smoke a little, I was fucking... 
[02:44:00]  No matter what I was doing, boom, asleep, gone, fucking passed down.  The beers don't work.  The beers don't work together.  But I love the beers.  Well, you've still got the beers, correct?  Yeah.  Well, then just fucking be happy with that asshole.  I am.  I'm not allowed to have any beer.  I got kegs in my house now.  You.  Rub it in, why don't you?  You fucking drove me to...  Oh, he's got two kegs.  Pot told me I can't smoke pot.  Now kegs in my house, motherfucker.  Yeah, he's got Bud Light and Guinness.  I can't drink, so I've got...  You grow weed all over here.  I don't grow weed.  I just go to this fucking goddamn weed Starbucks. 
[02:44:30]  Half the time I go and buy it and I don't even smoke it.  I just...  I can't get over the fact that I walk in and I'm like,  hey, so what are we talking about?  This strain, that strain, what's that one do?  Really?  I just want to buy it.  What are those lollipops?  Are those drinks?  Are those ice creams get you high?  Well, fucking give me some.  Fuck you, I pay taxes.  I make more money than everyone in this goddamn building.  Everybody give me a piece of all your weed.  And then just leave it in the car, legally.  It's like completely fucking okay.  So good.  Yeah, and you could smoke it in public?  Or is that a problem?  You can allegedly smoke it in Venice Beach in public.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do that. 
[02:45:00]  Because I heard like you could buy it, but you gotta like fucking rush home and smoke  it in your house with a blind shot or something.  I walk out with the steel.  I have the pre-rolls and it comes in the glass.  So you can take a puff, put it back in the glass, seal the lid, and it extinguishes it.  And it's like it didn't even happen.  Is there a little prescription label on it and shit?  It's the sickest thing ever.  I know.  Sometimes I'm like, you're my only fucking friend, man.  I swear to God, I love you.  You see this because you're out in LA.  Yeah, I got a couple buddies of mine.  And they like, one dude really fucked up his back and just the quality of shit that he, 
[02:45:30]  he looks at just like the illegal stuff, like people making beer in their bathtub.  Like why, why would this, this, this horse shit.  See, I thought there was maybe a couple places out there, but you're telling me it's like  popping up like Starbucks?  No, people are starting to complain about it.  Like I think in like Glendale, is it?  Old people, man.  Yeah, right, right.  Got nothing better to do than complain.  And the other thing, why would you, why would you get high before you flew to Costa Rica?  I feel better when you say that.  Why would I do that?  Cause I was, I just thought, I thought I was going to have that going. 
[02:46:00]  I smoked it.  I loved it.  Right.  But I was just like, I don't like.  Were you going on vacation or something?  Eating it's like mushrooms.  Yeah.  I was like borderline hallucinating.  I actually went into this, this Johnny Rockets is my girl was trying to get me to fucking  calm down because I was flying.  And there was literally this kid all the way across the restaurant, just going like, going  like, and it felt, it was right behind.  I literally felt like I was this close to understanding what the fuck the kid was saying.  Dude, it was brutal.  It was fun.  It was brutal.  It's classic. 
[02:46:30]  And then I would just see something and I thought it was the funniest thing.  I mean, talking like tears.  I was like blocking my face cause I didn't want, cause I was so paranoid that people were  going to see me.  I was, it was not.  You were fucked up.  Yeah.  You got to embrace that.  I stuck my passport.  I was sticking my passport in.  And you know where you, where you either put the credit card in and you slide the passport.  I was sticking the passport into the credit for like a minute until finally this lady  comes up to me.  She comes up to me, the lady at Continental, she just takes my passport and just sort of  swiped it. 
[02:47:00]  And then I went, Oh, thanks.  And I swear to God, I looked to the left and I laughed for like, I think three minutes.  I mean, I'm talking like high school cafeteria, beet red face, crying, laughing.  And then after that, that's when like the paranoia, I never told this story.  Dude, I went to go through security and now I'm in total panic.  And I'm just like, I have like no experience being high at all.  So I don't even know how to handle it.  I'm just like, please, I'm taking everything off.  And I made it all the way through and I'm literally gathering my shit out of the tin. 
[02:47:30]  And then one of the security dudes, this black guy was a few years ago.  He's like, yo, my man, he goes, yo, Chappelle show, Chappelle show.  And I was like, oh, fuck.  He goes, he goes, when's that coming back?  And I literally, I looked to the left again and laughed for like three minutes before I  could finally compose myself and be like, I don't know, man.  And I always felt bad because he probably thought I was this arrogant ass.  But you just fucked up.  Oh, no.  Dude, I remember this guy came walking through.  He had this big nose and his hair feathered back.  And my brain was like, his name is Larry. 
[02:48:00]  And it was the funniest thing I thought I'd ever heard.  Oh, he was also like, he had a soft serve ice cream.  And I'm dying laughing, crying, and I'm blocking my face.  A hundred people can see me.  I just don't want Larry to see me.  And I'm just blocking my face.  That was brutal.  It was fucking brutal.  I never did it again.  No, no, I just, that was it.  I like, dude, I was like weed hung over.  Yeah, that happens too.  That's cool.  Yeah.  You know, like when your foot falls asleep really bad, I felt like I had a ball of that  sitting on my head.  It was awful. 
[02:48:30]  When you're real fucked up and you start coming back down, that's a good thing.  You're like, all right.  All right.  Oh, and you know you're not going to die?  Yeah, this is good.  It's always a good vibe.  I'll be permanently retarded.  I think I'm going to make it through this one.  I had that thing where I smoked so much weed that I thought I could understand somebody else's  language.  I was in Paris and somebody was, I was in the back of some room and they were all smoking  hash joints and there was these girls that were about to do a performance in a boat and  they all had crazy tattoos.  One girl had steel teeth and these brandings on each other and the one girl had steel stars, 
[02:49:00]  sorry, red stars tattooed on her tits and her nipples were inked.  So somebody had inked her nipples.  Holy shit.  And then the other girl had a forest tattooed on her vagina and I'm in this little fucking  box talking to all these dudes and they keep passing around, which is kind of stupid because  I'm like, there's going to be fucking 20 doobies in this room and there's only like fucking  10 of us.  Why can't we all just hold one each?  Whatever you fucking Euro cocksuckers, just keep passing around.  I don't care.  So then all of a sudden they're talking like a bit and I, and they're like, Oh yeah, this  one likes me.  And he's like, well, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course I love her. 
[02:49:30]  Great.  She's fucking got steel teeth.  I'll fuck her.  So then this one's asked me if I want to see her vagina.  And I totally know that she said, do you want to see the vagina?  But she said it in fucking French and I'm so high that I know she said it according to  my fucking stone brain.  But then just to prove that I was right, she came over and showed me her fucking vagina.  Right.  And I was like leaning over down here.  So I couldn't see me because there's no wall.  There was no, uh, I couldn't sit upright.  It was too little of a room.  So I was down here. 
[02:50:00]  So when she pulled her vagina out, my face was in the beef and she had a full on bush like  a fucking forest.  It was a beautiful forest tattooed over a vagina.  And then they took me out cause they loved me and they wanted to do me.  They both took me out in front of the stage before the performance.  I was standing in the bit, you know, the bit where you jump over and security beat you  up.  I was in that bit.  So I am fucking gone out of my fuck.  I don't even know what the fuck.  I think it was an ecstasy session beyond belief, but all these hash joints.  And then these ladies had a fire breathing thing. 
[02:50:30]  They had all balls on their fucking elbows and shit, throwing fire and blowing fire.  And the fire was going over my head and the fire that was going over my head, the gasoline  was dripping down on me.  So I had like warm fire gasoline on me while this chick with steel teeth and fucking brandings  were fucking having lesbian sex with each other on the stage with fire and lesbians.  And I was like, get the fuck out.  There's nothing fucking better than this.  Somebody passed me a cigarette.  I didn't even smoke.  I just wanted to feel the vibe.  And then I go back to the hotel saying to myself, that's the greatest night ever.  And as I'm getting out of the taxi, I see this black chick who was being, uh, flirting 
[02:51:00]  with me when I left almost a day ago and she was leaving and she was in a taxi.  I was like, come on, come out.  And then she came out and we got a drink and then she went to my room and I didn't know  at the time, but she was a hooker.  But she did this thing on my penis that was like, you know how, I mean, paracetylene's  not very good at it, but you know in the video how she does the swirly hand thing?  Oh, swirly hand.  She did swirly hand thing with her uterus.  What?  She stood up.  It's fucking gnarly. 
[02:51:30]  She stood up over me.  I'm lying on the bed just like, okay, wow, here we go.  Cause she was completely in control.  I was like, wow, I'm a baby and I'm about to get my fucking, she's funneling a baby.  I could almost call the cops and get some money out of this.  But she stood up.  No, I think her hands might've been on my chest, but oftentimes she was balanced perfectly  just on her feet in this crutched up thing, like knees high and she would go swirl down  on the, on the penis, swirl up on the penis, swirling up and down, swirling up and down  like this fucking crazy Jamaican fucking blowjob vagina sex. 
[02:52:00]  And I was tripping balls, just watching my dick.  Like it was evil Knievel jumping over a fucking hundred buses.  I was like, you go boy, you go.  I was so pumped on my penis that day.  Damn.  That is a fucking night.  It is.  Tony Hawk.  Once again.  Thank you.  Fucking night.  He wasn't there.  I'm just saying.  You were so fucked up.  You understood French.  I completely spooked.  But you understood it.  French for at least two hours.  That's all right.  Tony Hawk was skateboarding in the white house the other day. 
[02:52:30]  He was.  They wanted me to call him on my radio show.  They're like, call Tony.  And I'm like, okay.  And they're like, do you want to talk to Tony in the white house?  I was like, yeah, of course.  Can you call him?  I'm like, oh, wait a minute.  You want me to call his cell phone while he's in the white house?  And you know my show.  I'm just going to go, hey, man, like, will you smoke some weed in there?  Or take it, you know, piss in somebody.  Steal something.  Go into the bathroom right now and piss on the floor.  You know what I mean?  Leave it up at Decker.  Yeah.  I'm like, I don't want to insult the guy.  He got to the white house.  Let him just have his moment.  Why do I have to bring it down with the Jason Ellis show? 
[02:53:00]  So I didn't.  I refused to call.  I shut it down.  Look at that.  Using a little common sense.  He's done enough.  He's done enough.  The last granule you had.  Yeah, I know.  It's really, I usually would do that.  I was listening to you recently.  Fedor was on.  Yeah, Melianenko.  And you were trying to get him to punch you or something?  To kick me.  Fucking took forever.  God damn.  God damn.  Did he eventually do it?  Illiterate cucksucker.  I didn't get to the end of the show.  No, he did.  He kicked me.  Because I had shit to do.  Twice.  Because the first one was a pussy kick.  So for real, you got Fedor to kick you?  Yeah, it was really weird too because I had to say some stuff about, I was like, how many 
[02:53:30]  kids do you have?  And he said two.  And I was like, how many baby mamas do you have?  And everybody in the room was like, whoa.  And I'm like, well, fuck.  It's a legitimate question.  And then the answer was two.  So I was fucking right.  He's a killing machine.  He's the greatest fighter in the world.  Don't tell me you only fuck one bitch.  It's impossible.  If you're the fucking toughest man in the world, you are slaying bitches all over the place.  This is what bitches want.  Rock stars pretend to be the toughest men in the world.  This man is the toughest man in the world. 
[02:54:00]  Everybody wants to fuck him.  And he kicked you?  Good.  And he kicked me.  The first time he kicked me, he kicked me.  And it was kind of hard because he's got a really good technique.  So it landed on the bone.  So it doesn't take much.  And I moved back and hit the couch.  And I got up.  And I was like, come on, man.  And he's like, no, no, no.  Someone else do it.  And I was like, come on.  Did I need Fedor to kick me?  And then the only time I could tell that there was someone in there, because it's hard to read  that guy because he's so.  He's a robot.  And I'm like, I don't even know what the fuck he's saying.  He doesn't look anti-bad or anything.  When are you going to kill somebody?  I mean, show me the death. 
[02:54:30]  What does it look like before you die?  Because I know that some people know that because he's a killing machine.  So we had eye contact.  And I was like, come on.  And I could see we don't speak English.  He doesn't speak English.  He was like, really?  Do you really want?  And I was like, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck that.  And I mean, he checked to see.  And I think in the first kick, because if you don't have conditioning, because I've been  training for a couple of years now.  The first time I got kicked without any training from a kickboxing friend of mine, Kick Cope,  he kicked me.  And the next day, I got internal bleeding.  And I had to get a blood clot in the back of my leg and all this shit. 
[02:55:00]  So my legs toughened up a lot more from then.  So he was like, OK.  And I was like, all right, do it.  And he still delivered, I would say, 50% of what he would usually do.  For one, he had jeans on.  And every day for like five days, every time I took a step, fatal, fatal.  You just felt that shit, huh?  Just felt like a little lump on the bone right there.  What kind of kick was it?  Like a front of the foot kind of?  It's just like that.  Or did he?  You don't kick with the front of your foot.  It might look like that when you watch fights. 
[02:55:30]  Do you actually kick with your shin bone?  If you kick with your ankle or your foot, you fuck your foot up.  It's with your shin that hits the femur.  And the guys, they condition their legs so much.  Their shin bone is thicker and the muscle on the shin bone moves off out of the way from doing it for 10 years.  So their bone, if he came in here right now and just put his shin bone on your femur, you would go, oh.  And you'd be like, oh my God, imagine if he actually threw the leg.  Kicked me with that fucking thing.  It's an amazing technique.  And the lawyers try to get involved with your bit? 
[02:56:00]  No, nobody did anything.  Nobody's really listening.  That's always handy.  You know what?  Hold on.  We'll give you a little advice.  Enjoy it.  No, I was just about to say that.  Being under the radar is the best.  I mean, we play some of our old tapes every once in a while on this show.  We're like, how the fuck did we get away with doing that?  We're playing that.  Once management looks at the screen and sees, beep.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, what do we got there?  There's something on our radar.  Because you're obviously on your way up and you're going to be on the radar.  And then you're going to be like, oh, motherfucker.  I am?  Motherfucker. 
[02:56:30]  Motherfucker.  I'll walk better get some agents.  No, you don't want to be on the radar.  It sucks.  They watch every move.  Really?  Those fighters, man.  That's just a whole other fucking level of toughness.  Oh, yeah.  We see these guys come in and it's like, fuck.  It's what you do, though.  You know what I mean?  You're just saying, it's like, it's crazy because of that.  But it's like, what about you guys on the radio?  What about you as a fucking comedian?  Yeah.  You know what?  No one can be as funny as you.  You're a fucking champ.  You've did your whole life out.  Pulling the muscle off of your fucking shin bone, dude.  There's nothing. 
[02:57:00]  It happens.  I got nothing.  No, no.  I'm saying this.  What am I going to compare that to?  You can't see inside your mind.  You can't see inside your mind.  Hey, what's up with this Obama?  Is this guy wacky?  Come on.  It's really not on the same fucking level.  You're putting yourself down.  Come on.  No, these guys make you realize you're really not a man when they come in.  Like Liddell and fucking Fedor and who else have we had in Rampage?  Dude, they're like the few guys.  They're like, I'm nothing.  You're nothing in the ring, but that's not saying anything. 
[02:57:30]  But we all want to be a tough guy.  Every single guy wants to be a tough guy.  But this is the thing, though.  If you've never committed a crime, you never did any time, that's your big question.  Like, could I somehow survive prison?  Those fucking guys, you know, if they've never been to prison, all those M&Bs, they'd be fucking running the place.  Yeah.  That might be a bigger statement because you've got to deal with people stabbing you.  If you're really big and you can take a punch, it might work out worse for you because you're going to take way more to shut you off.  That's true.  They might come after you more.  The best thing sometimes is to be shut off.  If Rampage goes to jail, I'm like one-on-one. 
[02:58:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm like, yo, dog, let's take this guy.  And when I say let's take this guy, I'm talking to that whole pack over there.  Six of them jump on you and you go to the ground and you think they're going to lose.  It's like those action movies and all of a sudden the pile just starts fucking moving.  And it just comes up with fucking joints and limbs and toes.  Beating other people with the other guy's limbs.  What else have you done on your show lately, Jason?  I had MC Hammer on the show and it was weird because I just heard you with him and how he was saying that he meant to spend all his money and I was just calling bullshit on him for that. 
[02:58:30]  Because I'm like, you accidentally fucking went bankrupt like out of your fucking ass you did.  If that's what gets you through the day to believe so you can not shoot yourself in the face, I'm cool with that.  But don't come in here and try to back that.  Look, man, I was trying to take care of all my brothers and keep them off the streets for one extra day.  How about staying in business?  That would have kept your brothers off for the rest of their lives.  But we ended up being friends.  We should have pushed him more on that because it was a weird story.  I noticed he was pretty shaky about even talking about that shit though. 
[02:59:00]  But you can tell it did something to him.  He has an effect about it.  He talked about sports, all the other sports he's in and boxing and stuff.  And I was like, you wouldn't stand a chance against me in boxing.  He's like, oh, I've been boxing since I was nine.  And I was like, well, and I can see in your eyes that you don't want any.  And I was like, my eyes can see that your nose is dead straight and anyone with a dead straight nose can't fight for shit.  You wouldn't last 10 seconds with me.  And that was when it got heated.  And then it mellowed out to the point where I was like, at the end of the day, he does have the number one selling song ever, doesn't he? 
[02:59:30]  Is it ever?  It is ever, I believe.  And it now will be forever thanks to the internet.  He employed half of Oakland at one point.  Yes, he did.  And then the second he ran out of his money, everyone left him and no one helped him out.  I think that's why he has that look on his face.  He learned one of the hardest.  He's a nice guy.  Well, now he's trying to make the comeback.  He was here with just a son.  No entourage this time.  Good.  Smart.  Just one guy.  We learn by your mistakes.  Yeah.  Bridget Nielsen was on the other day.  She was really good. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah?  She's a fucking crazy bitch.  She really is a crazy bitch.  You get a lot of good fucking guests because you're out there in LA.  It's because I'm on your fucking deal, dude.  I'm telling you.  I'm starting to get on the radar.  Opie Anthony and all the XM people are like, hey, man.  We play the best of Jason Ellis on the weekend.  What is she doing these days, Bridget?  She got a bunch of reconstructive, you know what I mean?  I don't look old and on crack anymore things.  So she looks a little hotter.  Humongous bitch, though.  Humongous. 
[03:00:30]  I would love to do her.  But after it, because I've always...  Yeah, I always envisioned that she would be really good orally.  I would think that her blowjob would be...  I would like to switch all the lights off and there'd be maybe some sort of sex alien  monster blowing me.  Because I say that there'd be shit that'd be going on that you wouldn't even know how  it's possible that there's something rubbing that region while something else is happening.  I'm pretty sure she could have a conversation and a cup of tea while she's blowing it.  She's got a mouth on her.  But she ended up reminding me of my mother, so that went out the window.  Ah, shit. 
[03:01:00]  My mother's a complete...  She's insane.  Can't have that, though.  She's insane.  She can't hear it.  Yeah, she's completely insane.  Me and you.  And so is Bridget Nielsen.  Me and you.  Yeah.  It makes for good radio, having an insane mom.  I guess, you know.  Yeah.  Made you who you are.  Yeah.  Yeah, defending dudes that offer me speed when I'm 10 years old, still to this day.  He didn't know what he was doing.  Oh my God, Mom!  He offered me fucking speed when I was 10!  How do you defend this man?  Oh, it was a tough time for him. 
[03:01:30]  I'm like, fuck you, fuck it.  That's it, I'm out of here.  I can't continue this coming.  And what were you telling me outside the studio about Perez Hilton's friend?  Oh, Perez.  Because I never got the ending of the story.  I had to take a leak.  Yeah, Jeffree Star came on my show, and he's like a really hot dude.  He's a chick.  He looks like Rene Russo, but maybe when she was 18.  He's had full face, nose, lip.  He has like puffy lips, this red hair thing, really skinny arms.  So he looks kind of like a, you know, he's covered in tattoos. 
[03:02:00]  He's kind of like a really hot chick, but it's a dude.  And it doesn't have tits.  Is he trying to be a chick?  No.  It's weird.  Why?  He's a gay guy.  Dressed like a girl, but he doesn't take pills.  So he has no titties and a penis.  And he likes to fuck dudes that aren't gay.  And that's his story.  He was going on it big time, and of course, he wanted to do me.  And he's like, I just want to suck your dick under the table right now.  I was like, well, that's not going to work out.  I'm married.  And he's like, well, that's not cheating.  I'm a guy.  And I'm like, well, I tell you what. 
[03:02:30]  If my wife says you can blow me, you can fucking blow me under the table.  So like half the people got it, and half the people called me like,  Dallas, I fucking want construction.  All my friends want construction.  You're fucking freaking us out right now, man.  You do not fucking, do not even like take this serious.  You cannot let him suck your dick.  I'm like, come on, man.  Just leave it up to my wife, man.  It's not either here nor there for you or me to decide.  Just let it.  Fuck, man.  You're freaking me out. 
[03:03:00]  I was like, God.  And then afterwards, when I left, she was.  Did you get the wife on the phone?  Yeah, she called me on the phone.  I didn't get her on the radio.  She called because I had to leave to get on a plane to come here.  I leave, and she's calling me.  So I'm walking behind Jeffrey Starr as my wife calls.  I'm like, babe.  She's like, what's going on?  They just wanted you on the radio.  This guy wanted to suck my cock, and I was going to have you on the air  to whether you decided to suck the cock or not.  And she's like, really?  And I'm like, yeah.  And then he's like, let me just hold.  He turned.  He's talking to me.  He's like, let me just hold it.  And he's fucking.  He's licking his lips, and he's getting really into it.  And he's thinking.  Because he's like, all gay guys want me to suck their cock. 
[03:03:30]  And I was like, oh, yeah.  I mean, oh, sorry.  All straight guys want me to suck their cock.  Yeah.  So I'm like, well, I really.  So she's in the parking lot, and she's staring at it.  She's like, what about if I just touch it?  Let me just cup it.  And I'm like, really?  I can't do that?  It would have to be my wife's decision.  My wife's on the phone, who's half Mexican, saying,  you better tell that motherfucker to shut the fuck up.  And she's like, what's she saying?  She's saying that, no, you cannot blow me.  I'm trying to do it in a polite way.  Because the dude, he has like a taser in his pocket. 
[03:04:00]  He tases people, and he fights people, and he punches bitches in the throat.  He's a very angry gay man.  It's very.  He could taser you, and then fuck you in the ass.  No, he will.  Can't even do anything.  Very angry.  He's going to take it.  What's his claim to fame?  I don't know.  His claim to fame is he knows Perez, or whatever the fucking fat homo's name is.  He knows that fat dude, and learned from him how to do shock.  She wants a TV show.  Sorry, he wants a TV show.  Hey, look, I have a song, a single with auto-tune. 
[03:04:30]  Such fucking bullshit, auto-tune.  Everyone sounds like fucking Cher, but no one's fucking.  Exactly.  Just talking about that.  That's what DJ Scribble was saying.  Scribble, it's fucking pathetic.  Would you agree?  It's horrible.  It's the worst thing ever.  You guys are bringing back Cher.  When that song came out, she was over with, and that was 20 years ago,  and now you're bringing it back in the club.  She better focus on her daughter there.  What did the daughter do?  Sex change.  I let it live.  Is she getting a dick put on or cut off? 
[03:05:00]  Put on, yeah.  Put on a dick.  Having a dick put on.  Is that possible?  Hormones.  It is possible.  She's going all in.  She's going all in.  Wait, how do you?  Chastity Bono.  Chastity Bono is becoming a guy.  I get that.  Where do they get the spare dick from?  From your toes.  From your toes.  Little toes.  They normally cut a chunk out of your thigh and fashion a dick and then take the clit.  But what the fuck does it look like?  Looks like a fucked up cock.  They take the clit, though, and put it in a place where it's sensitive, 
[03:05:30]  so you can have some kind of sexual sensitivity.  I would just get a robotic cock.  It's ridiculous.  And then you've got to have a pump type thing to actually make a rock.  Did you ever see that South Park episode about that?  Where they were talking about-  Is that where you get your information from?  No, but they did this great thing about-  They were talking about how these guys have become women that want to be referred to as she or her.  And they just basically broke the whole fucking thing down as,  No, you're not a-  You're not-  You're a deformed man. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  It's like having webbed feet.  You're just a disfigured, disgusting human being.  But webbed feet on purpose.  Yeah, you've-  Pull some slime on you and sell you at toy stores.  You've disfigured yourself.  You fucking hideous, goddamn character.  I heard Ronnie talking about it once, and he's like,  What's the difference between somebody going,  I don't want my arm,  and going to a doctor and saying,  Could you cut my arm off?  I just don't want it.  And what doctor with any ethics would do that?  It's like, but your dick, you could be like,  I don't want my dick.  And they'll cut that fucker off. 
[03:06:30]  They don't care.  Yeah, but that means being a dude and a girl is different  than being a one-armed guy.  Yeah, but, you know-  I understand it.  I understand the mind of somebody being born to be a woman,  and they're a guy.  I understand.  I mean, if you're committed to actually letting the dude  cut your dick off,  you must be very committed to the game.  I'm passionate about shit,  but I've never-  You ain't cutting my dick off to get anything.  It's like, if you're a guy, though,  that wants to be a girl,  you know,  what if you're a fucking radio guy  that wants to be the fucking president of the United States?  It just ain't gonna happen.  I'm not born here.  I want to be governor. 
[03:07:00]  You could do that.  Do you want to hear what I stand for?  Mm-hmm.  You don't really want to, do you?  I was like, okay, weed.  Good, here it goes.  I was trying to figure it out.  Yeah, weed, legalized marijuana.  If you're 65, you're not allowed to vote anymore  because you've fucking had a good run  and it's time for the kids to enjoy themselves.  Fuck you and your nit-nack fucking picky shit.  Yeah.  I believe that we should get all the troops out of Iraq  and send them to Mexico  and beat the shit out of the Mexican police and drug dealers  and then open Mexico as, like, a humongous Disneyland  where everybody can work there  and we can all go for vacations  and no one gets shot or anything. 
[03:07:30]  It's called the North American Union.  They're working on it right now.  Step cell research.  I'm for it.  See how it's working perfectly.  Gay dudes should be allowed to marry each other.  Fine by that.  And what else do I stand for?  It's pretty much it.  Oh, prostitution.  Legal.  Yeah.  Done.  You know what I mean?  Tax it.  You're welcome.  It should be.  Prostitution.  Weed.  Legalize it.  Tax it.  Done.  Yeah, absolutely.  Make some money off it.  Everybody's going to get it, man.  You're not going to be able to stop me.  When I had no brain and I could barely walk  and I had no fucking money, 
[03:08:00]  I got weed all the time.  Yeah.  It's not that hard.  God, you were making business transactions  in junior high.  Really?  You were?  Like, people understood the supply and demand  and here's the guy with this much  and he sells this much to that guy  so now he's the little lower level guy.  It's good business.  Little cartel in junior high.  Yeah, you get your big bag,  you try to sell it  and then you decide to smoke it all yourself  and then you're worried about the dude  that gave it to you  who's going to beat the shit out of you  and you learn the hard way  that you've got to fucking,  you know what I mean?  Don't get high on your own supply. 
[03:08:30]  Come up with some cash.  Me and Bill are distracted.  We're looking at the same fucking thing.  There's a four and a pound three-year-old.  His fat fucking baby show today.  Oh, fat baby freak show.  It's one of my favorite fucking shows he does  because he gets a whole buffet out  for the kids to just stuff their faces for the show.  Yeah, but the parents sit there crying  and just stop feeding them.  Yeah, why is she?  Stopped them for about a month.  God, that's a humongous baby.  Has he got diapers on right there?  Maury is a sick fuck because  He is.  He's a devil.  Because the babies are really fat 
[03:09:00]  so he makes sure they have no shirts on  so you can really enjoy their fatness.  And they're eating.  And he gets a buffet for the little fuck.  Yeah, they make them jump up and down.  Right, so their baby tits are flopping.  You know what we're going to do?  We're going to cook this child.  I'm going to put them in the oven  and just baste them like a turkey  for five hours.  There's something about them.  You want to just fucking slap them.  You really do.  Yeah, you want to slap the parents.  Yeah.  I want to beat the parent with the child.  I just want to hear what that sounds like.  Just grab the kid by the legs  and just beat the mother with the fucking...  That's completely fair. 
[03:09:30]  God, would that be great.  Dude, you'd throw out your back.  I know.  He's been swinging a mess.  Ow.  He's got to be a 200-pound five-year-old for sure.  That's insane.  He's actually three.  He's 120.  You ever see those strongman competitions  when they pick up those big granite balls  that they should pick up  in the little fat fucks?  Well, then he can actually earn a living.  That enabling fucking cunt of a mother.  This one's in a crib.  What is she crying about?  Just stop feeding him, you dumb ass.  Yeah.  He cries when I try to stop feeding him. 
[03:10:00]  Well, then deal with the crying  until he figures it out.  Look at that little ear arc.  I don't know if I...  He looks like George Wendt.  Baby George Wendt.  It looks like George Wendt.  Mini George.  It's a sad state of affairs right there.  Oh, yeah.  Towing him up the stairs with no shirt on.  Is there no God?  You know what?  I can tolerate a lot.  Leave him alone.  I don't think I can raise a fat kid.  You know what?  If he had a bunch of tattoos,  I reckon he'd look all right.  Yeah.  Like chicks would probably do it.  You know what I mean?  Like, hey, what are you looking at, bitch?  You know what I mean? 
[03:10:30]  Like if he just pops some tattoos on him.  There's something about him, man.  I just want to throw him in a pool.  I just want to see how big this splash is.  He's kind of cute.  Dude, three years old, 114 pounds.  He's three?  He's three.  He's like five foot tall.  This guy's a fucking beast.  He's three.  Dude.  He should have a little sailor tattoo.  Is he fucking finding it hard to hold his head up right there?  Did he almost fall over?  He's got a big fat head.  What the fuck?  He's a cutie.  That's something he's...  I want to slap that belly.  I don't know why.  That's something you could control. 
[03:11:00]  He's like the cutest fat person I've ever seen.  Oh, come on.  They put him in front of food now and let him eat.  That's just wrong.  Is he so fat that one of his eyes is looking the wrong way?  Is he going cross-eyed from fat?  Maury is a sick fuck.  Why are people smiling?  Because they think he's adorable.  He's fucking diseased.  He really is.  They're clapping and smiling.  He's so fat, his forehead is collapsing down onto his eyes.  Look, he's spinning around like a little monkey.  I want to kick him in his stomach.  Because Maury's making him spin, so everything starts jiggling. 
[03:11:30]  Maury knows what he's doing.  Let's just leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  He's going to fall.  Come on.  I want to see him fall over.  This is terrible.  Oh, this one has to wheel him around.  They've got to wheel him around in a wheelchair?  He looks like Chubsy Ubsy from our gang.  Man, it's disgusting.  Chubsy Ubsy.  She should be put in jail.  She should be.  That's child abuse.  It is.  What the fuck is the difference between hitting a kid and letting a kid get that fat?  I'd rather suck a dick and look like that.  His calves are as big as mine.  Why are they applauding? 
[03:12:00]  Why are you at a Maury show?  That's true.  You know what I'm saying?  We have him in here.  We call him out on all this.  We call him out.  We're like, Maury, you love the freak angle.  Have you ever had him on?  A few times.  Yes.  Is he evil?  Look at this chick with the boobs.  Does he sell cocaine?  Did you see that?  Yeah.  She's like two and she has a sports bra.  They have to put a bra on her because she's fucking two years old.  It's fat.  But she's got big fat tits.  Yeah.  She has big fat baby tits.  She's four years old and they got to put a top on her because she's got big fat tits. 
[03:12:30]  Where can't we see him?  Is it weird that I want to see fat baby tits?  Oh my God.  That's hysterical.  They had to cover up a big fat baby tits.  She has to wear a bra.  I feel like that's insulting.  It's like making a fat dude wear a bra.  It's like, what?  Fuck.  It's like a little boy kid could walk out and he needed a bra.  She's four, 110 pounds.  And she wears a bra.  Those man tits are funny.  She has tits at five.  Fat tits are perverted.  Fuck that.  Wow.  Look at her cleavage.  She's four years old, 104 pounds.  Dude, you know something?  If they made these two kids wrestle, that would be the greatest show ever. 
[03:13:00]  We're going to have kid wrestling next.  She looks like fat child wrestling.  Host a radio show in Tampa.  Who is fucking...  Look at her weird...  And her tits go off to the side.  Why are you looking at her tits?  I can't help it.  Stop looking at a fucking rat's tits.  She has a fucking rat.  She's 700 pounds?  No.  She's four and has giant tits for a kid.  How can you just let her do that?  That's like somebody's a junkie and they come on and shoot heroin in the eyeball in the green room. 
[03:13:30]  Coming up next, this junkie.  Maury, I need help.  I have a drug problem.  Here's some heroin.  Yeah, here's some heroin and then we'll fix you.  Here's some meth.  Oh, man.  Stop it.  That's like C-cups.  She has C-cups at four years old.  What the fuck?  Why do you have this shit on your screens?  You've got her and the other cancer of society on the next screen.  Oh, Kyra?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope somebody, just some random tough macho lesbian knocks her the fuck out and I can watch that on YouTube for the rest of my life. 
[03:14:00]  That is some kind...  I don't know what that child is.  Put a tent on it.  I can't figure it out.  It looks like it's got rubber bands at every joint on its body.  It's got those fat indents.  It's like you put scrunchies all over her.  Man.  We've got to wrap up if we're going to play those Nixon tapes.  Nixon tapes?  Yeah, we've got more Nixon tapes from the old days that we're going to replay.  Tricky dick.  Why are they laughing?  I love fat babies.  Punch them in the stomach, Maury.  Squeeze their tits, Maury.  I would pay to watch that fat chick fight that fat baby. 
[03:14:30]  That would be hysterical.  So an average four-year-old weighs 35 to 40 pounds.  She weighs 104.  Yeah.  So that's why they're saying that they weigh 700 pounds, I think.  They can't walk down these stairs.  The fat is coming out of her kneecaps.  Why is the mother smiling and waving?  Oh, my God.  Stop feeding her.  Oh, my God.  He can't get up on stairs.  He can't get up.  The other kid fell down and can't get up.  He's like a turtle on its back.  This is great.  You know what's funny about it?  I want to get in that ass. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's an animal.  That kid, something's really fucked up.  He must have eaten Maury.  Just stick some fur on his back and put him in a cage.  He's a beast.  Why don't you give her a hug?  They should seriously put the two of them in a movie because they look like adults.  Just do the next look who's talking.  Yeah.  That kid is looking at Maury like the old cartoons and all he sees is food now.  Food, yeah.  That's why he's looking at that fat girl like a big turkey.  All right.  What a bit of a reality show.  Like, I ate celebrities.  Something like that.  And you can pull all these other arsehole irrelevant cocksuckers on a show where they 
[03:15:30]  eat them.  Look at the size of that kid's cock.  We're on a time thing.  We got two minutes left.  So, Jason Ellis, always a pleasure when you come to New York.  Thanks for having me.  Jason stopped by with his stories.  Jason stopped by with his stories.  You're a very funny dude.  Oh, thank you, man.  How does it work out for you?  It's going all right.  Do you get laid from your jokes?  There's no ecstasy up my ass.  It was overrated, to be honest.  But do you tell jokes and get blowjobs from the joke?  No, it doesn't really happen.  It's not like cleavage in the mouth?  It's not like skateboarding or fucking musicians or anything.  Come on, man.  Sheiks love funny guys.  You haven't told a joke and then got a blowjob from it? 
[03:16:00]  Are you married?  There's a lot of, like, divorced waitresses.  Are you married?  No.  You're single?  Yeah.  So then tell me about it.  No, I have a girlfriend, but I'm not married, no.  Did she blow you because you're funny?  No.  I mean, you don't look like Brad Pitt.  Is she hot?  Dude, you're killed for, like, 45 minutes.  You're really trying to squeeze the last fucking two drops out of this shit.  I'm desperate.  I've got to get back on a fucking plane.  Come on.  Give me something.  What do you got?  No, no, lesbian, no, fat.  That's a great girl, man.  Jason Ellis is on the faction every afternoon. 
[03:16:30]  And the virus.  And the virus on weekends.  You can hear the best of Jason Ellis.  DJ Scribble.  Not necessarily the best.  Yes, sir.  Not necessarily the best.  You're right.  You want to play us out?  PSA?  Yeah, let's do this.  DJ Scribble doing a great job.  Go to djscribble.com to see what he's got going on.  Allow me to reintroduce myself.  My name is Ho.  Ho.  H to the O-V.  I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z.  I guess even back then you can call me CEO of the R-O-C.  Ho.  Fresh out the frying pan into the fire. 
[03:17:00]  I be the music bin's number one supplier.  Flyer than a piece of paper bearing my name.  Got the hottest chick in the game.  Wearing my chain.  That's right.  Ho.  Ho.  Not D-O-C, but similar to them letters.  No one can do it better.  I check tether like a food inspector.  My homie Strick told me, dude, finish your breakfast.  So that's what I'm going to do.  Take you back to the dude with the Lexus.  Fast forward to Jews in the necklace.  Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this.  Shoot at you, act us like movie directors. </pre>
