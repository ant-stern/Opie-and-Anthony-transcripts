<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The July 13, 2006, Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show was a chaotic mix of personal woes, celebrity encounters, prank warfare, and outrageous contest ideas.  The broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton insulting themselves and their listeners, labeling themselves "rabid radio retards" and "perverts." Opie's dominant narrative involved his disastrous Manhattan apartment, where two walls had collapsed due to flooding from a broken pipe, adding to pre-existing problems like a mouse infestation (approximately 30 mice killed in the past year) and a previously collapsed wall.  He detailed his increasingly angry attempts to contact his unresponsive landlord, threatening legal action and reporting the situation to 311.  This frustration stemmed from a stressful day compounded by a severe headache and a deluge of emails related to show-related issues.

Norton contributed anecdotes from his red-carpet experience at Montel Williams' birthday party, where he was repeatedly ushered on and off the carpet, and a chance encounter with Paris Hilton at XM Jazz, facilitated by E-Rock (Eric).  Photos of Norton and E-Rock with Paris Hilton were extensively discussed, particularly focusing on E-Rock’s proximity to Paris.  They also shared a story about Howard Stern's alleged policy of having deliveries left in the lobby if he was in the building.  The show included announcements for a new *Clerks 2* sponsored contest.

A segment dedicated to brainstorming $1,000 giveaway ideas yielded suggestions ranging from humiliating contests to a city-wide scavenger hunt and a "money snatch" contest involving women (details left vague due to studio policy). Past contests, including a 55-gallon drum challenge with women in bikinis and unpleasant substances, and a blind boxing match (resulting in previous injuries), were also revisited.  A listener offered to have his hairy back waxed with sticky mouse traps for $1,000, an offer the hosts tentatively accepted.  News discussions covered Barbaro’s leg injury, the Michael Strahan divorce, the Israel-Lebanon conflict (criticizing media coverage), the collapse of a section of the Ted Williams Tunnel, and a two-headed kitten.  An upcoming golf outing with celebrities like Phil Simms and Boomer Esiason was also mentioned, along with the hosts' annoyance with a late coffee delivery.

Another segment included a caller describing a local Hawthorne, New York tornado, which the hosts downplayed.  This transitioned into the "Surrey Watch" segment, tracking sightings of Suri Cruise, leading to a critique of sensationalist news teases, exemplified by a ludicrous tease about a life-saving urinal. Several callers shared their experiences with local news and absurd teases.  Otto and George were present in the studio for much of this segment, which also covered Mancow Muller's firing, including an anecdote from Danny Bonaduce about physically assaulting him. The "walkover" segment, where the hosts interacted with passersby, featured off-color remarks.  A $100,000 bounty offered by Break.com for a Suri Cruise video and a listener homework assignment for suggesting what they’d do for $1,000 were also discussed.  Frequent offensive language was used throughout.

A substantial portion addressed Opie and Anthony's recent firing, attributed to a controversial St. Patrick's Day stunt.  They expressed bitterness towards their former employer, using highly offensive language, while boasting about their XM success.  Otto and George were again present, participating in vulgar jokes often targeting various ethnic groups and containing homophobic slurs.  Discussions included online gambling, the absurdity of Homeland Security's target list, and numerous offensive anecdotes.  A significant focus was on their feud with the Houston radio show, Walton and Johnson (sometimes referred to as Masters and Johnson).  Comedian Bill Burr recounted receiving an angry email from one of the hosts after Opie and Anthony mocked the show. This email, read on air, contained insults and challenges to a fight. Opie and Anthony rallied their listeners ("pests") to phone bomb Walton and Johnson’s show, sharing contact information to facilitate the planned attack, playing audio clips from the rival show to illustrate their points.

A later segment detailed the prank war against Walton and Johnson, involving flooding their phone lines and mocking their audio clips, particularly their song parodies.  Listeners called in to report their success.  Opie's eviction due to water damage was again discussed, along with encouragement for listeners to participate in a coordinated phone assault on Walton and Johnson the following day. The segment was filled with vulgar language, offensive jokes, and sexually explicit content.  Callers frequently contributed vulgar commentary.

Finally, a segment featured a caller detailing deplorable apartment conditions, including sewage and vermin, and his strategy of escalating complaints to the city. The hosts encouraged his aggressive approach with crude jokes.  Otto briefly appeared to promote his comedy CDs and DVD, and a sexually suggestive listener email was read on air.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  I'm so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow, we're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the scene like Greg and Tony.  Opie, I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:00:30]  Anthony, I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James, I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a cool spits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's like Chuck.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Roc!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Earth? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:01:30]  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, McFriend.  You know what that music means.  It's time for an Opian Anthony show.  That's what they tell me.  But I'm a beaten man.  Yeah.  With the worst headache of my life.  Someday someone's going to ask me, what was the worst headache of your life? 
[00:02:00]  And I could point to this day, July 13, 2006.  And say, I'm a beaten man.  That was the day.  Worst headache of my life this morning.  No joke.  And I know what the faithful listeners are going to say.  And then, uh...  I don't think I've ever been more pissed off than I am right at this moment. 
[00:02:30]  So pissed off, you'd have to be pretty pissed, that I'm not even going to yell.  You know when you get pissed off, it kind of helps to yell and scream.  Throw things.  Yeah.  Punch brick walls.  Strangle people.  He'll do whatever it takes to maybe get some of that rage out.  Slice people's throats.  I could honestly say, I am so pissed off I will not be screaming.  Yeah, that's the beaten man phase. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And if I do scream, I, I, I, uh...  I don't know.  I might have a nervous breakdown.  I might have an aneurysm in my brain.  Well, that's not good.  It would not be good.  First one's good for radio.  Second one, not good for radio.  Because the screaming I did last night gave me an instant headache that has lasted, I'm up to nine hours.  Aspirin will not take it away.  Nothing will take it away.  I couldn't sleep last night.  Were you and, uh...  You and your chick like Jack and Rose on the Titanic last night? 
[00:03:30]  Oh my God.  That's the only thing I could picture.  Opie cuffed to a pipe as she tries to cut it with an axe so they can get out of Opie's basement apartment that is quickly filling with water.  He's so bad at packing, he won't, like, leave him to look like his neck to five.  It was a weird day yesterday.  For some reason yesterday I was, I was putting out a million fires.  A million fires that have something to do with this radio show.  Why yesterday?  Say I don't know.  And I was just, I was to the point I had it. 
[00:04:00]  Just dumb little things that, uh, behind the scenes that should be taken care of.  And it's not being taken care of for some reason.  Eight million emails coming in.  Ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you didn't see any?  I just, we corresponded about, uh, some contest or something like that.  No, I didn't see any.  Oh, I saw a couple of emails, like, no, more than five.  About eight emails in, I finally got, like, cc'd on them.  So I had to, like, blow out an email about that. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, not to bore people, because it's all, all, like, uh, just crap.  I'll tell you this much, I, uh...  It's not boring.  People are fascinated with what we do on a daily basis.  I, uh, I'm a radio show host, and for many years I was also a producer.  I don't want to be a producer anymore.  I will not be a producer anymore.  We have people behind the scenes that are supposed to be taking care of all the BS.  And when I have to answer a hundred emails and take phone calls from people with just 
[00:05:00]  the dumbest little things that they need answers for...  Quite literally a hundred.  I can't do it anymore.  No.  I want to just be able to focus on, uh, being, uh, on the air with Anthony and Jim Norton.  On the show.  That's it.  And if, if you need my expertise, great.  I would love to take a phone call or, uh, or write an email and correspond and try to  help out some of the problems.  So, that got me going, and I'm like, oh my god, oh my god, I just want to go to bed.  So it's like nine o'clock. 
[00:05:30]  Now you're just gonna, you finally decided, just gonna go to bed.  Yeah.  I'm like, alright, you know, good night's sleep.  And then I can regroup tomorrow and get my head together and try to figure out some  of the problems we're having behind the scenes and how to fix them, okay?  Annoying day over, just time to lay down.  Oh yeah.  To get it all.  Relax and go to sleep.  Let it go.  So it's around nine and I go, uh, and you can hear it in my voice.  I still have a cold, but I also lost my voice last night.  Oh my god, it's time to go to bed, you guys. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, it's starting to sound like that.  So, uh, so I go, let's just go to bed.  And, uh, so Lindsay goes downstairs and see, I had to move downstairs.  I have, I have two levels here in Manhattan.  Okay.  I used to live, I used to, what am I saying?  Live.  I used to, uh, go to bed in the front room, but you know, when you have to go to bed at  839, people are still walking outside your window.  The homeless people are taking showers with the, with the nozzle, you know, right outside 
[00:06:30]  your window or digging through the garbage.  Lots of action.  The French couple upstairs, they have like three or four cats and they refuse to get  a rug.  So I've had it out with them for like, uh, over the years pounding and to the point now,  you know, we're, we're ready to be in a fist fight.  Mortal enemies.  And I have no problem beating up French people.  I've done it in the past and I'll do it again.  No problem.  Frog upstairs.  And you know, they think it's funny with their cat running back and forth across a wood  floor over and over again.  And then I started playing the, all right, I'll ring your buzzer at four in the morning 
[00:07:00]  game for a while.  They know I did that.  And now when we see each other, it's just a matter of something happening.  There's a cat in your apartment.  The cat.  The cat is Rossi.  Get your own litter box.  Right.  So, so I had to move down into the basement so I could get a good night's sleep.  And it's a finished basement.  And when I got the apartment, you know, uh, the slum landlord, well, who I will be dealing  with big time today. 
[00:07:30]  He never told me the thing like, um, you know, uh, leaks water when it rains too much.  So, I mean, if you've been following this story for a while there, you know, if it rains  too much, the water will rise and I'll get a few puddles in the basement.  Kind of a hassle.  Don't want to deal with it, but it's not too, it wasn't that bad to be honest with you.  I can deal.  I can deal.  Okay.  And then I've told you the mouse problem.  You know, I've killed close to 30, uh, mice in the last year alone.  They're fleeing the water. 
[00:08:00]  And, uh, if you remember the, the basement wall about two, three weeks ago, uh, like the,  the bottom, like, uh, two feet of the wall collapsed.  That's safe.  Cause water is collected behind the wall and it needed to get out.  So the whole bottom of this wall just collapsed, filling the basement up with a sewage and  dirt and leaves and about six inches of water.  I think we talked about this on this side of the show.  Unbelievable.  You're still there.  So I have no choice.  I'm, I'm looking for a play.  I mean, it's just a whole thing now. 
[00:08:30]  Okay.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  So when the wall exploded, thousands of dollars of, of crap was ruined.  So I've been going back and forth with the slum landlord about that.  Okay.  He wall, I told him that's great, but there's, there's a major problem here that you got to  look into.  Obviously this is not normal.  Something is going on.  And while you're at it, I said, this apartment is, you know, basic maintenance.  I'm an easygoing guy when I'm not here. 
[00:09:00]  Trust me.  I am, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll take a lot of crap, but I'm like, look, it's time to do  some basic maintenance on this apartment.  I've killed 30 mice.  I need an exterminator.  Uh, the place has a fireplace that was a good selling point when I was, uh, decided to rent  this place.  I told you the story of, uh, the one time with the Java log and you know, I asked, I asked  him to fix the, uh, fireplace that was never done.  I said, I need the exterminator and also the two front doors to the brownstone don't close 
[00:09:30]  properly.  And I had this creepy neighbor pounding on my door one day, DJ doom.  That's what I see happening.  DJ doom rigs the gas pipe in the basement, right?  Blow the place up.  Opie.  So I gave him a list of things only a few days ago.  Like, look, this stuff has to be taken care of.  It's not normal.  You know, when you live in a brownstone in Manhattan, you need, you know, the two doors  to, to close properly.  So, so homeless people or neighbors that you don't like that are creepy, don't, don't 
[00:10:00]  don't knock on your actual apartment door.  I leave my apartment wondering if someone's in the hallway because most of the time the  doors that lead out to the street are not closed properly.  Oh, the shotgun.  Huh?  That's what I would do.  Well, so then there's, so there was a whole list of these problems.  So last night after dealing with the crap with the radio show, the behind the scenes  crap, uh, so Lindsay goes downstairs to go to bed and all of a sudden I hear the screams. 
[00:10:30]  I'm like, Oh God, no, no, no.  I go downstairs.  Another wall, not the one they fixed, collapsed the bottom two feet of the wall, completely  pushed inward toward the basement, water, sewage, leaves, dirt, a smell I can't even  describe all over the place.  Yeah.  There's a broken pipe and this is, and yeah, and this is what I had to deal with as I just  wanted to go to bed last night.  We had quite the deluge here in New York, a lot of rain last night. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  And, uh, you have a broken drainage pipe from the street is what's happening.  And it's, it's leaking into, uh, uh, uh, the foundation and coming right through your  wall.  And that's what I told the guy when the first wall collapsed, but he just ignored it.  He just patched up the wall and, and just said that, you know, uh, what, what can I  tell you?  It's, it's New York when it rains a lot.  It ain't even his issue.  Dude, this type of thing happens.  He could call the city and the city has to fix that because it's, it's, you know, a sewage 
[00:11:30]  pipe or something, a drainage pipe.  So he hasn't even done that.  So I immediately got on, uh, the phone to my slum landlord, his cell number.  Of course he doesn't pick up.  Why would he, he knows when tenants from the building are calling and he refuses to talk  to us live.  If it's raining, he knows not to pick up.  He eventually gets back to you.  Eventually.  Excuse last time.  Why?  He didn't get back to me, uh, uh, until like four or five days later, something about a  dental procedure.  He was just coming out of some kind of, some kind of haze. 
[00:12:00]  And he finally got back to me and he apologized.  That sounds good.  So, uh, I lost my ass.  Like I've never lost my ass.  You could hear it in my voice.  I may get arrested today cause I threatened the guy.  I threatened the guy bodily harm.  I basically said, I do not show up in this apartment.  You know, I don't even want to say what I said cause it's bad enough.  I left it on his, on his, uh, cell phone.  That'll show up in court.  I just lost my ass. 
[00:12:30]  Lost it.  Like I've never lost it before.  I was very frightened.  That type of threat if he plays it in court does certainly does show though that there  was a real problem.  Yeah.  If you're in that moment and you're yelling that, that actually works in your favor.  I think I'm going to be playing lawyer.  I want to get you eight years to prison.  Until, until his lawyer goes, wasn't there an incident at St. Patrick's Cathedral that  you, oh geez.  So.  I object.  So then I go to.  Stricken from the record.  So then I get a, uh, uh, an immediate headache that will not go away. 
[00:13:00]  And then, um, I got an email from the slum landlord last night.  This is after what I just told you happened.  Just, just add all the screaming in there, by the way.  I'm ridiculous screaming on his cell phone.  I was losing my ass.  And then I, I typed out, you want to talk about angry typing guy?  I wrote an email.  Might be able to read part of it actually.  What the hell?  Where is it?  Uh, we have a serious effing problem. 
[00:13:30]  I've had it.  Another wall in the basement has collapsed sending six inches of water everywhere.  I need someone here tomorrow morning to clean up the basement.  I'm not doing it this time.  Wall needs to be repaired.  Another list of, of S that has been ruined is coming your way.  As for us, I have to go sleep in a hotel.  Thanks for taking me seriously when I said that this is a major problem that needs to be looked into.  I will be calling 3-1-1 tomorrow.  Okay, so I left that.  I left out a couple things, by the way. 
[00:14:00]  And I left something on his cell phone.  So he writes me back last night.  And this is all he says.  This effing prick.  Greg, I'm sorry to hear about your dilemma.  Dilemma.  What is your corporate name and DBA name?  And that's it.  That's all I get.  I don't care.  What does he need that for?  Unless he's got his checkbook out.  I don't get, you know, I'll be there first thing in the morning with a cleaning crew to at least clean up the sewage. 
[00:14:30]  You answer him back.  Like you said, off air.  Like, what is in that water?  Not healthy stuff.  Yeah.  It ain't Poland spring porn in there.  Because the last time it happened, it happened on like a Sunday afternoon.  So I spent like three or four hours cleaning up the whole basement myself.  Because I wanted to sleep.  Where did you sleep last night?  Sleep in the front room in a cramped bed.  Trust me. 
[00:15:00]  It was just a nightmare.  You are going to have to abandon the basement.  That should be the last night you ever spent.  You cannot sleep down there because you're probably breathing in mold.  I'm probably.  Mold is an awful thing.  So I'm just a beaten man.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  I'm not going to like yell and scream because, you know, that's fun for everybody.  Whatever.  You got to get out of the apartment.  I know it sucks.  You got to go into a hotel.  Yeah, I know.  You have to do it.  Trust me.  I got to deal with it today.  And it's a nightmare because I'm dealing with all sorts of other crap behind the scenes 
[00:15:30]  that I don't want to be dealing with.  And now I got to add this to the list.  And then sue the guy for the cost of the hotel is what you do.  You get a hotel.  You document everything.  And then you sue this ass for the cost of the hotel.  You take all your stuff.  You have guys come with a truck.  Look, anything you need, you put it in storage for a little while.  And you stay in a nice hotel.  There you go.  Room service.  Maid comes in.  Kenny's making phone calls in a couple hours while we do the show. 
[00:16:00]  Just get videotaped.  And I love these asses.  Some dude from his mobile device.  Wah, wah, wah.  Poor little rich boy.  Be more funny.  There you go.  You had to know that was going to pop up.  Sorry, but this show has been about real issues that happen to us as well.  Wasn't funny enough for you yesterday.  On the air a few minutes.  Talking about what happened last night.  And wah, wah, wah. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Well, we'll copy down his email address.  And that might end up on a website tonight.  That could.  Go listen to somebody else then.  That could end up on a...  This is...  This is...  This is part of the radio show.  Oh, my God.  That's a legitimate complaint, I think.  You don't want your walls being caved in with water.  With sewage and rats.  Wah, wah, wah.  There's raw sewage and rats in my basement.  I could see if you were, like, really furious.  Like, I'm dealing with all this crap.  And then the butler drops out of your... 
[00:17:00]  Right.  All right.  Then maybe you should shut your face.  Stupid...  That's not the part you left out, is it?  Stupid me for explaining why I might not be in the mood to do a radio show today.  God, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I explained it to you.  Dude, that's a structural issue, too.  That's, like, a real major problem.  If you have a basement and walls being caved in, you have, like, a legitimate lawsuit.  A place could come down.  Yeah.  What I'm trying to figure out is how much water does it take that it's making the, you know,  the wall collapse like that?  How much water is behind these walls?  Didn't they build some kind of wall around when they built the trade center? 
[00:17:30]  Just because the water didn't come in?  Yeah, so the water doesn't come in.  In flood.  It's built in a big tub.  But it's water, like, and the wall is coming, you know what I mean?  Coming apart.  There's a broken pipe in front of your building.  So there's got to be so much water behind these walls, and obviously it can't take any  more water or pressure, and it has to release somewhere.  So it's fine in the weakest spot.  And the only reason it didn't come out from the same spot was because they fixed that  and made that area stronger. 
[00:18:00]  It's like a tribute to New Orleans.  No peace base.  You know, down there, there's some black guy with a case of Heineken walking through  the water.  Up front of his bed, waving.  So how old is that building?  That's a hundred-year-old building, right?  Eight-year-old building?  Oh.  It's an asshole, brownstone.  See, I mean, we joke about it, but I don't know how to take care of myself.  Yes, I make good money now, but I've never, like, I guess the way I was brought up, I just  don't know how to, like, you know, I don't know, give myself good things. 
[00:18:30]  It's just a weird thing.  And now I'm in, just now I'm in hell.  I'm in hell.  Because I want to be out of there, like, today.  You're the epitome of not a rich guy.  You're really low-maintenance.  No, and that's why I try to explain it on the radio.  Yeah, people don't get it.  You've got to live at your means.  Not above, just at.  At it right now, at this point in your life, it's not in a leaky basement apartment.  But this apartment has cost me a couple hundred thousand dollars. 
[00:19:00]  This isn't, like, a little, you know, crappy little place.  So, you know, it's not like I'm, like, well, decided to get a horrible, horrible apartment  in Manhattan.  I got a really nice place for, you know, the area I'm in.  And I am paying, you know, accordingly.  It's just been one problem after another.  It's, like, one of these, it's a money pit type of situation.  Got to get out.  I had a, I mean, really fast, and we'll move on. 
[00:19:30]  At least 30 mice in the last year I've killed.  That's when I decided to start killing them.  So, who knows how many more I would have killed in four years.  Been there about four years.  I had a fireplace that wasn't working properly, and I almost burned down the whole building.  The fire department had to show up.  The famous Javalock story.  Of course.  People just, you know, like the funny part of the Javalock story.  But the reality is it was a real issue, a real situation.  Then I had the pipe burst in the kitchen, flooding the living room and almost electrocuting me. 
[00:20:00]  The water going down the stairs and through the ceiling and collapsing probably a four by eight section of the ceiling.  The whole ceiling came down onto my computer.  Oh, that's nice.  I remember that one.  And then, you know, obviously the basement thing with the, uh, the siege and now the collapsing of two walls at this point.  Two doors that do not close properly.  So, any homeless guy or anyone that wants to do me wrong can just knock on my apartment. 
[00:20:30]  I have to leave my apartment and kind of peek around the corners and make sure I'm safe.  That's, that's good.  That's what you, you want in your life.  People are saying, yeah, it could be mold that you have a cold like that all the time instead of, um, a cold.  Right.  You could have mold.  You have the mold.  And I do bring this up on the show because, you know what, I'm not alone.  There are, there are just scumbag landlords all over New York City, all over the area you're probably listening to us from. 
[00:21:00]  And they just get away with murder.  People are saying the mics are all clicking like crazy over at XM.  Oh, really?  Fix that over there.  Could you do that?  Fix that, please.  Sorry, I can't fix that problem.  Don't make me fix that problem, too.  If you grab a screwdriver and, uh, get over there.  You got a wrench.  Get out of that apartment and sue that scumbag.  You gotta get out there, man.  You can't, that's dangerous. 
[00:21:30]  You can't, you can't have a wall coming down on your head.  You know, you're just like,  Yeah, who knows if the next one is going to be the ceiling coming down.  Seriously.  I mean, because if these walls are collapsing, like I said, how much water is behind these walls?  And I try to tell the guy.  Comes in, all of a sudden the whole building comes down.  There is definitely a broken pipe.  That is so obvious.  Yeah.  I said it to him.  Broken, just managed pipe.  Okay.  So, uh, we'll move on, but I just wanted to, you know, let everyone know what's going on. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah, and this is obviously Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, have a call to the set?  In case you're wondering.  We phoned in Opie's, uh, call to the set.  All right, we'll take a break and, uh, we will get into some things.  Had a tornado here in New York.  Did he?  The weathermen are saying that.  But then they're sending, now they're backing off a little and saying, well, the investigators are going to be sent around to see if it was a tornado. 
[00:22:30]  Tornadic activity.  They're saying, tornadic activity.  Ow, that's stupid weathermen.  Go to the Midwest, where entire towns are picked up and slammed down by Jesus.  By Jesus.  Not, you know, yeah, my car kind of got pushed into a tree.  Some of my vinyl siding came off.  That's the tornadoes we get, and it's all exciting.  Ooh, we had a tornado, did we?  I think so. 
[00:23:00]  And I didn't have a day as bad as Ops, but, uh, we'll get into it.  You know, my celebrity encounter with Young Hawk, and then my other red carpet experience.  It just, oh, that's good stuff.  I don't want to get into it.  Sounds fun.  Just, you people think you have stress.  All right, we'll, uh, we'll, we'll get into what, uh, Jimmy's all about next.  And we're going to talk about this a little more, too.  Douches.  Whether you like it or not.  No, I, I can't keep talking about it just to annoy that one guy.  I said what I, I said what I had to say.  But, I mean, it's been an ongoing storyline on the show, so there's the latest. 
[00:23:30]  There's the latest.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony show is on an extensive quest to find the most obnoxious 30 seconds of audio ever recorded.  How annoying?  This annoying.  I like my brain.

[00:24:30]  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number.  Everyone on PalTalk's waking up.  All it is is girls washing their hair and, like, doing their morning rituals.  It's wonderful to watch.  Why do they wash their hair?  I asked a couple of girls out on New Year's Eve, and they both had to do that. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, sorry.  I'd like to go out with you, but I'm washing my hair.  Was that actually an old excuse in the older days?  I wanted a take back in 1950 to wash your hair.  Now it's like, I have chlamydia.  And Jim says, I don't care.  So do I.  No, I gave it to you.  That's like a cold to me.  I love chlamydia.  Oh, sure.  So, Jimmy, what happened last night?  You did a little red carpet action?  Yeah, it was.  Ooh.  I went to, my friend Modi invited me to Montel Williams' birthday party. 
[00:25:30]  You get all the big events.  Yeah, well, you know, that was the most sought-after event next to, I understand, Big Kev had two people in his back seat.  That and Montel's birthday party.  I couldn't think of anything else that would be insignificant.  And you having people in your back seat, as much as you're my friend, is an insignificant event.  Exactly.  Montel's birthday party was.  Who was there?  What, uh, celebrities?  Oh, dude, the list.  Star-studded?  Well, I've never had this happen.  I got the list right here. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, he was there?  It was a big one.  This is the sound of the paparazzi as they're waiting for a celebrity to show up.  Hi, guys.  Oh.  Cameras down, pointing at the sidewalk, waiting and waiting and waiting for the celebrities  to show up at the Montel Williams' birthday party.  Well, I pull up in my arm.  A comment from Montel.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, he knew it on his arm.  Oh, really?  I, um...  Well, I walk up and I'm like, oh, God, I hope I'm on the list because I'm never on the list. 
[00:26:30]  And it's so embarrassing.  It's awful.  I'm walking towards...  Sorry, sir.  You're not on the list, sir.  The woman sees me and she lifts the little...  Did you know that those velvet ropes, you can actually walk through them?  I'd never known that.  Wait, wait.  If...  You're kidding.  How does that work?  If they lift the velvet rope and move it, people pass through that.  I've never had that happen.  Wow.  But as I'm walking up to her, she goes, Jim Norton?  Whoa.  And she lifts it without even looking at her paper. 
[00:27:00]  And did you say, you must be mistaken?  I said, no.  Check the list.  I can't possibly be on it.  Well, she...  And as I'm walking, she goes, go over there.  We want you to walk the red carpet.  Oh.  You know how it is.  And so I'm walking and this older woman stops me and goes, sir, could you go in this way?  She wanted me in the little people way.  After someone sent you to the red carpet way, this bitch wanted to actually get you off the red carpet. 
[00:27:30]  With no offense to the listeners, but she wanted me to walk in with the likes of you.  Oh.  How dare she?  So I stopped.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  So I'm going to walk in.  The lady goes, oh, no, you got to go this way.  And then she scolds the old lady.  He's a big stand-up comic.  Why wouldn't the lady on the carpet know not to shoo people off?  No, no, no.  It was before the carpet.  She was like 65.  I wasn't angry about it.  It was okay.  She just didn't know.  You'd be angry.  Nah, you know what it is.  I'm a humble Jimmy.  That's my nickname.  Everybody knows that.  So I walk. 
[00:28:00]  With catty Jimmy.  And the lady takes me in.  And I have such low self-esteem.  I've never done this before.  So there's like a bunch of paparazzi.  I go, okay, where do we go?  And she goes, oh, you walk right leg there.  Stand in front of them.  And nothing happened.  And I'm like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Take some pictures of me.  Please take my pictures.  No one's going to take my picture.  There was that little Jimmy Norton low self-esteem moment where I'm standing there alone.  You're on the red carpet.  Photographers don't want to take my picture. 
[00:28:30]  And they did.  They all started doing it.  And they started with, Jim, over here.  Oh.  And I have my cell phone in my left pocket.  And I have, like, those headphones taped.  Like, you know, I hooked into my shirt.  Because I'm not ready to have my picture.  And I'm standing there with my stupid fat frown on just looking around.  I had, no, I've never photographed me before.  You're all confused.  Dude, I've never had that happen.  And then I decided to smile.  So I start smiling.  Oh, no.  And they're like, Jim, over this way.  And they all took my picture. 
[00:29:00]  And so I finally decided to give them a profile shot.  I'm like, get your cameras ready.  This is what you want.  And I gave them a profile.  And all of the paparazzi rolled.  It got like a nine and a half.  They all laughed at my profile.  They know looking through that viewfinder.  Oh, he's awful.  What was the profile?  Did you?  No, I just turned.  You ever look at my head from the start?  Yeah, it's awful.  It's an abomination.  We all hate it.  So I said, get this shot.  And I did it.  They all snapped it and laughed.  It really shows how you have no chin.  What's going on?  Oh, it was awful.  Jim, this way.  Jim, over here to the left.  Smiling.  And then I had to go do a few interviews for, you know, Montel's show. 
[00:29:30]  Nice.  It was his 50th birthday.  And wishing I had a 50.  50.  God bless.  Yeah.  God bless.  I think I said, and many more.  Hey, that's a good one.  Know who you were?  No.  He didn't know?  Why, Woody?  Just like Danny DeVito yesterday?  Oh, dude, none of them know me.  He didn't know.  That was hilarious, though.  So they didn't.  We talked to Danny.  There was supposed to be those rumors that 50 Cent was going to be there and a whole bunch  of them.  Oh, you always get those rumors.  I was at a book release party for some Who Cares book at, where was it? 
[00:30:00]  I think it was Privilege, actually.  Yeah.  The strip club down there on 11th Avenue.  I went with you to that.  Yeah.  And remember the rumors that the Hilton sisters were supposed to be there?  Whenever you're invited to, my voice ain't going to make the whole show, by the way.  Did you get the days in, sisters?  But whenever you go to these shindigs, these celebrity shindigs, they always start the rumors  that some big celebrity is going to be there just to keep the people there.  Yeah.  Like the biggest celebrities there were me and Jimmy, which means nothing. 
[00:30:30]  Trust me.  And the word, everyone's like, the Hilton sisters, they're supposed to be here any  minute.  Paris and Nikki.  Yeah, sure.  They're supposed to be here.  So everyone's like, well, hey, is that them over there?  Any blonde in the distance look like it could have been her?  Oh, that's her.  That's her.  Those things, I gave up on those things years ago.  I'd never been.  They're just so stupid.  Who's a rapper?  Are you into the K?  Karrion or Karrion?  Somebody might know. 
[00:31:00]  He's on BET a lot.  He's supposed to be a pretty fan.  K-R-S-1.  Oh, cut it out.  I know him.  I was going old school.  Oh, that's BDP, you goof.  And Montel, for his own birthday, sang a bunch of songs.  No, he didn't.  Stop it.  Yeah.  All right.  Immediately now, stop.  He didn't sing.  Yeah, he did a bunch of songs.  You know who's to blame for this?  Jamie Foxx.  He's to blame for now every black guy thinking that they could just get a forum and start singing 
[00:31:30]  and they're going to be wonderful and everyone's going to want to listen.  No one wants to listen to Jamie Foxx sing.  They wanted to watch his movie with the Ray Charles thing.  His record sales are ridiculous.  Do you know one person who bought it?  Yes.  Who?  Jody from Staten Island.  Who's that?  I don't know.  One person.  The worst lie I ever heard.  You should have at least said Tyrone or something. 
[00:32:00]  No, but get the billboard charts.  Well, I don't doubt it.  He's sold.  He's the real deal.  There are a lot of people that like to try to do that crossover and they fail miserably,  but you got to give it to them.  His success annoys the living crap out of me.  Yeah, why?  And I can't figure it out.  You know, we talked to him back in the day at the Grammys when we flew.  Maybe that's why.  We flew to New York for the Grammys and he was just another good guy, just another B-list  celebrity, C-list celebrity that we talked to that day.  And out of nowhere, he blows up.  He was on that stupid show. 
[00:32:30]  What show was he on?  Living Color.  Living Color.  So he's one of those that were on there that really for years after that, it was Jim Carrey  was the guy that really made the jump from that.  And then the Wayans brothers kind of had their goofy movies and stuff.  But he was like the one where I kind of remember him from that show.  And then all of a sudden, he's on stage crying out at his grandma while he's got an Oscar  in his hand.  Is that an Oscar in your hand?  But he was a good actor.  It annoys me.  The word on him, like, I mean, the word, but I mean, people always talk about what a 
[00:33:00]  good actor he was as a stand.  He was a comedian.  And not like, you know, from like, what was the Pacino movie, Sunday, the football movie.  Any given Sunday.  And people were always saying, and he was great as what Bundy and he played in Ali.  He was really good in that.  So I mean, so he's a good actor, man.  It's like, he's a really good actor.  Go see Stealth.  And Rent's Stealth.  I'm with Anthony, though.  There's something about it that bothers me.  There's something that bothers me.  But I got to give him credit.  I mean, he knows what he's doing as far as singing.  But I'll agree with you.  There's something about him that drives me nuts, too. 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  I don't think he should be as successful as he is.  I think because maybe he's taking himself too seriously now.  Yes.  Because the reality is he was on In Living Color.  Yeah.  A great.  I'll rock your world.  Yeah.  A great comedy show.  But, you know, he's another one of these celebrities who wants to forget where he came  from, I think.  And he wants to get a lot more respect and blah, blah, blah.  I was home yesterday afternoon and Young Hawk called me.  Young Hawk.  Better known as E-Rock or Eric.  And Oak raises a good point. 
[00:34:00]  Normally, when Eric calls, it's the same feeling you get when the doctor you had your brain  tumor tested with calls.  It's never going to be fun.  E-Rock called me, too, yesterday.  Well, Eric says to me, I got no call from Eric.  You're lucky.  Thank goodness.  I pick up.  I'm like, what do you want?  That's how you talk to Eric.  And he goes.  Hold on.  I will challenge you right now.  All right.  He obviously said something that was not interesting to you, right?  Absolutely.  I have to.  I'll face that challenge. 
[00:34:30]  He says to me.  Well, because he said something to me, too.  And I think mine is even more who cares than yours.  What's yours?  You tell me first.  No, because you started this.  Is it about a person?  Oh.  Oh.  Is it about.  Behind my back.  He did not.  You told him the same story.  Wait.  No.  Which means yes.  Is this him coming out of the closet?  The gay thing.  We all know that.  No.  Oh.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  He told me another Howard Stern story.  Yeah.  E-Rock is all connected. 
[00:35:00]  E-Rock's been in the business.  E-Rock's in the business.  For 42 years.  He's connected.  And he's only 19.  He's got the inside scoop on a bunch of things.  Eric has either been doing radio since he was one or he's 58.  He's got more radio stories than anyone in this room.  But I lie.  Fair is fair, though.  I think, when did he start radio?  At like 14?  16.  16.  He got a very early start.  He never looks.  Mark Pereno's show.  And for West Palm Beach, because his whole family listens, the kid has a lot of potential.  Trust me, Matt.  Yes.  He just needs to figure out when to sleep. 
[00:35:30]  That young regarded.  Because he calls with dumb stuff.  Because instead of telling me that story you told me yesterday, that could have been another  10 minutes you could have slept.  Because I was like, oh, wow.  All right.  I'll do something with that info.  Thanks.  Click.  That's what my phone rings.  This is not as good as Howard Stewart.  My phone rings.  I pick up.  And he gets Eric.  I'm like, this is going to be a problem.  What?  Yeah.  He goes, hey, I don't know if you're doing anything, but over at XM Jazz, Paris Hilton's  being interviewed.  Oh.  Do you want to probably go down there and see if we can meet her? 
[00:36:00]  She has big feet.  Well, you raise a good point.  All right.  So I got in a cab and five minutes later, I was at XM Jazz.  And thank you, XM.  Handled wonderfully by all the lovely people.  We were, our name was on the list.  And we get up into XM Jazz.  And five minutes later, there's Paris Hilton.  And taking a photograph with Jim Norton.  And then taking a photograph with-  You got a picture with Paris Hilton last night? 
[00:36:30]  Yesterday afternoon.  Where is it?  Two-thirty in the afternoon.  Eric-  You got any camera with you?  No, I was on it.  Eric has a 7.2 mega.  That's what we say.  7.2.  Yeah, I have five, which is child's play.  I get the nines.  What?  I get the nines that are out there.  Oh, you're a size queen with mega pixels.  Yeah, size queen.  I like a nice fat nine.  Oh, by the way, when he told me Paris Hilton's going to be there, this is what a faggot I am.  I go, do I have time to take a shower?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  I not only said that, but before I left, I actually had, I didn't have a chain on, so 
[00:37:00]  I put my chain on, and I put cologne on.  Oh.  I put cologne on for my Paris Hilton picture.  God.  Like a douche.  She is a true professional.  I'm looking at the Jim Norton Paris Hilton picture.  Yes.  And even in the picture with Jim Norton, she gives the I want to F you face.  She's sexy, man.  Wow.  Look at my hair.  I'm a disaster in that photo.  Let me sing.  You just took that beating like a man.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  I'll get that.  Even in the picture with Jim Norton, she gives the I want to F you face.  Dude, look at that.  She takes a very good picture.  She's amazing.  Look at my hair, too.  Like, that looks nice.  She's not like.  If that's all you had to do, you would take a good picture, too, Anthony.  That's her whole job in life.  But she's not all slutted out.  I've seen her all slutted out, and she takes, like, a picture where it looks really bad.  Her whole job is to look good in photographs.  She almost looks wholesome in that picture.  She was actually like an ivory girl.  What does she do?  Her whole job is to just look good in photographs.  We know what she does.  Do you see the video?  Yes.  All you need to do.  She's pretty good at that, too. 
[00:38:00]  I'm not used to seeing her without that greenish tinge to the video.  I didn't know her mouth actually closed.  Her eyes looking like a raccoon in the road at night.  She was actually pleasant.  I mean, it was just a quick hello.  I mean, um.  Oh, and there's the hawk picture.  Oh, what are you going to go?  Ew, I didn't see this.  Ew, I didn't see this.  Get this on opianthony.com immediately.  You are an ass.  Dude, I took that photo and didn't notice that. 
[00:38:30]  He is leaning into her.  He's leaning into Paris Hilton head to head.  They're touching heads.  And E-Rock is giving his bedroom eyes.  Bedroom eyes.  Ew, I didn't.  You should be shot.  That's your bedroom eyes.  Ew.  Your head is against her hair and her head.  She looks like she's kind of leaning away a little bit, and you are bent into her with  your head against her head.  Look at the mouth on her.  Cheek to cheek.  You can see the mouth is about to go. 
[00:39:00]  Die.  Oh, get away.  It's not the picture.  Smile, smile.  Get off.  We die.  Ew.  Get that picture up.  Bedroom eyes.  It looks like you're going to start crooning to her.  You're lucky I didn't see that while I was taking this.  I would have stopped the photo and bitten your face in the middle of it.  That is atrocious.  She's not happy.  How can she?  No.  She's not happy in the E-Rock picture.  She's much happier in the Jim Norton picture.  Get these pics up so everyone can check it out.  I put my arm around her, and someone print out my picture with Pauly. 
[00:39:30]  Your picture, E-Rock, is almost bordering on, like, rape.  That's great.  That's a big get, by the way, as far as celebrity photos go.  We got Nikki Hilton at the honorage thing, but I didn't follow her around looking for her.  I didn't care about her.  By the way, she has...  What about a big bony feet?  Well, Eric, it's for you, Anthony.  We think about you all the time.  Thank you.  Yes.  What's up with that?  You got a mic or something?  I got a mic on for something.  Why don't you lean your head into the mic like you did this poor girl's head?  Pretend there's a millionaire girl who likes hogs. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, so I made sure to look.  She does have big feet.  Big feet.  And are there a lot of tendons in them going toward the toes?  Does it seem like big tendons on top?  Very skeletal.  Very skeletal.  See?  Is she as hot in person?  She's...  Except for those talons.  She's really hot, man.  I mean, you can't say she's...  She's sexy.  She's a pretty girl, and she takes a good picture.  She actually did, like, since she was kind of done down.  Yeah, she's not done all slutty. 
[00:40:30]  Dressed up.  She wasn't dressed up, really.  She looks nice.  She got a little white headband thing.  A hair thing.  Like, very retro 60s looking.  Kind of nice.  Looks good.  Good picture.  Pleasant.  Block thing as disturbing as all hell.  Oh, what an ass you are.  You're leaning in.  That's a boyfriend, girlfriend.  You're 16 years old in the photo booth picture.  Yes, it is.  That's what that is.  You put your faces next to each other and smile.  That's actually two photos spliced together.  That's the photo booth boyfriend and attack victim put next to him. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Boy, does she not look...  You can see who's happy about this relationship.  This is, like, the star 80 photo.  That's probably the last...  Star 80, yeah.  That's the last photo.  The boyfriend is just happy that she's there with him.  He's got a knife in her back.  She just...  Please get this creep away from you.  I hope the answer to this is no, because I don't want to chew up my knuckles punching Eric in the face.  But I will get up and punch him.  Is that your new picture on MySpace?  It has to be.  I got to punch you.  I have to punch you.  Why?  I knew it was going to be.  But it has to be. 
[00:41:30]  That's it.  I just took a wild guess.  You have a MySpace account.  You got a picture with Paris Hilton.  Of course it has to be.  You want to see this awful picture?  MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  Why, you?  You don't have Eric's picture up.  You son of a...  No, the pictures will be up on opianthony.com.  You just stole a bunch of people that were going to his site.  Right.  My picture...  I'm going to put mine up today.  MySpace hijacker.  You suck.  By the way, can I clear something up?  What, baby?  Yes, I did say fly to the Grammys in New York. 
[00:42:00]  Yes, I took a 747 10 blocks, you asses.  From Boston, right?  Oh, my God.  People are beating the crap out of me going,  you flew to the Grammys in New York?  Why don't you go get some sleep, Ope?  Oh, boy.  Now you sound stupid, don't you, jackass?  We were doing radio...  See?  But people don't want me to over-explain stuff.  We were doing radio at the time in Boston,  and they flew us to the Grammys in New York,  and that's when we had an interview with Jamie Foxx. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, dummy.  Don't you feel stupid now, Brian?  Brian, you ass.  I'm an ass, but wait.  You just said again that they were in New York.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You didn't hear that?  Brian.  Brian, you're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  We were doing radio in Boston,  and they flew us to New York to cover the Grammys.  Now what?  Now what do you have to say?  Yeah, I remember that. 
[00:43:00]  I remember that.  No, you don't.  You stupid.  You idiot.  You idiot.  I told you guys to give me a slight break today,  just a slight break.  All right, so.  Their audience?  By the way, my phone call is, yeah,  is way more who cares than yours.  What a dreamy-eyed douche he is.  I can't because he was like, can I get a picture too?  It's like, hey, Eric, you hooked us up.  Of course you can get a picture.  He's dreamy.  His eyes, his brow is like kind of furrowed in the middle 
[00:43:30]  and going down a little like, hey, baby.  It's revolting.  It really is.  This photo, the head is so tilted in.  He's trying too hard, and it's so obvious in that picture,  to get close to her.  And I'm sure he was only thinking, new MySpace picture,  here it is.  I got to get close to her.  If it just looks like a celebrity picture,  that's not good enough because everyone has those.  I want people to go to MySpace and think I'm going out with Paris Hilton.  So I have to get in there and make it look different 
[00:44:00]  than just anybody taking a celebrity shot.  What's even more creepy is the bedroom eyes.  The bedroom eyes.  And with the left hand, you look like she's sitting on your lap.  It looks like Otto and George.  This is your Paris puppet.  You look like he's controlling her.  Well, we should take a break.  We're running late.  Certainly.  He called me about Howard last night, too.  Should I tell that real fast?  Do we have time?  I'm eating dinner, and it's Iraq. 
[00:44:30]  We'll make it fast.  He goes, you're not going to believe this one.  And, of course, you would.  Like, what?  What, Iraq?  What happened?  Well, remember when my buddy catered some breakfast for the show?  I go, yeah, we had a catering job for the satellite radio company that Howard works for.  Yeah.  All the salespeople.  I'm like, yeah, so?  He goes, no, man.  So they show up with all the catering, you know, and they're downstairs,  and they weren't allowed to go upstairs because Howard was in the building. 
[00:45:00]  Really?  Okay, so that's a cool start to the story.  Then what happened?  So, Iraq, explain.  So I told them that apparently they have a policy that if Howard's in the building,  anybody who has any kind of delivery is not allowed to deliver it to Sirius.  They have to leave it in the lobby, and somebody has to come down and get it.  Really?  And I'm sitting there eating my dinner like, oh, wow, that's kind of interesting.  It's kind of funny, yeah.  Could have waited.  Oh, you haven't had a wait?  Didn't need a phone call.  I didn't know what to say. 
[00:45:30]  I'm like, wow, all right, thanks.  We'll do an hour on that tomorrow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  I'm still in shock with the potential for films and a script I see for this.  Do you mean if I had something to be delivered to him,  I couldn't just walk in it myself and have to leave it downstairs?  Please, I can't.  Just paint the picture for the listeners.  Well, we've heard the stories, how paranoid he is, so that's not a surprise.  I love the fact that they take his whole limo up in an elevator.  That is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, the whole limousine just pulls into a giant elevator and lifts him up. 
[00:46:00]  The service elevator.  So he doesn't have to.  And lifts him.  With him and his limo all the way up.  Yeah.  So how high up was that again?  We were there.  I don't know.  In the 40s somewhere.  40-some-odd stories.  And then he can step out of the limo and be right there and not have to face any of the  fans that defend him.  So, Eric, you're saying if this dreamy-eyed face of you had showed up for a delivery,  they wouldn't just allow you to walk right in?  No, they wouldn't, Jim.  What are you delivering?  Baby doll eyes?  I'm delivering a pair of baby doll eyes. 
[00:46:30]  Anybody call for these?  Anybody call for a pair of baby blues?  All right.  We'll take a break.  You take a picture with a catering guy?  Lean your head in?  I took that picture and didn't catch it.  I can't believe I didn't catch that.  How did you not?  I'd have thrown the camera at his head.  I just wanted to make sure I got, I call him son.  I wanted to get son a good picture because he hooked me up.  Bob from Boston.  Great radio.  Let's spend all morning discussing photos that no one can see.  Yeah, because it's only 2006. 
[00:47:00]  You jackass jerk.  Everything is available on what's called the internet these days.  If there's a picture and we talk about it, it's instantly put up on this thing called the  information superhighway.  I think they're calling it these days, you fossilized idiot.  You never heard about it?  Those pictures will be up on opianathony.com.  And trust me, when you see the picture of E-Rod, you too will laugh at him.  I don't think they're going to Photoshop this on Wackbag or any of the other places with 
[00:47:30]  punky men.  Yeah, I don't think they'll Photoshop Eric's face with Hulk Hogan or like Robert Reed or  the Chippendale dancer.  Oh, yeah.  Those dreamy eyes.  Big man's chest against Eric's face.  They wouldn't dare do that because that would be embarrassing.  You look like you should have been like Liberace's lover or something in that picture.  Liberace's boy toy.  Oh.  A little young.  All right, we'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And now, Reflections on James Norton with Mr. Robert Sack. 
[00:48:00]  I'd sure like to be his girlfriend.  Walking in the park hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around me.  Cuddling in the spool position.  All right, Steph.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the fluking hand cleaner.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here we go.  But who knows? 
[00:48:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're trying to figure out stuff.  We just found out, I think, yesterday.  Maybe Tom could correct me if I'm wrong.  But I'm here and we have $1,000 a day to give away starting next week.  There's something like that.  Thanks to the fine folks that are involved with Clerks 2.  A movie I saw and really, really liked. 
[00:49:00]  The problem is we need some time.  Because I know our listeners.  We know our listeners.  And they'll do some crazy things for $1,000 cash.  Yeah, that's the way we get people to come up and perform.  We don't want this to be a throwaway contest.  A throwaway contest like the iMac contest turned out to be.  We love iMac, but we didn't have enough time to prepare and do some nice things for them and for our listeners.  Right.  And we're kind of in the same situation. 
[00:49:30]  We found out, I guess, yesterday that we have $1,000 a day to give away.  Wow, you talking over that riff is really annoying.  Why?  It's just like the music itself wasn't bad.  But then the guitar riff comes in.  And then you talk.  It's like you're trying to talk over it.  It was so loud.  Tom Chiasano, everyone.  Still putting his tie on.  You never put your tie on before you walk in.  I like that.  Casual to the last minute. 
[00:50:00]  He's just happy to be alive today.  He's a very well-dressed man.  Read about it tomorrow in The Post.  I feel really bad for my fallen comrades.  A lot of really good people lost their jobs yesterday.  A lot of really good people.  Yeah, $1,000.  $1,000 a day.  Whatever you want to do.  Clerks 2, right?  You want to give it away at random.  You got a really good phone call.  Can we just promote Clerks 2 all next week?  Because that's what they want for their $1,000, right?  And then can we give the money away a couple weeks from now so we can really develop this thing? 
[00:50:30]  Which means if – when's it open?  Next Friday?  Yeah.  We promote it all week, and then after the opening, and then the whole first week it's open, you're still promoting.  Also, I'm doing the contest.  They're actually going to get an extra week of promotion and mentions.  You understand what I'm saying?  That would be good.  We just want more lead time on it to promote something.  We want to come up with a real good contest.  You don't need to do a – we'll have other things like this.  You don't need to do a contest.  You can just take a phone call.  That's boring, though.  And we're not that nice.  We want our people to work for their $1,000.  They have to suffer.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:51:00]  You think we're that nice?  Hey, Bob, congratulations.  We're just going to hand you $1,000.  You're the 88th caller.  We want you to look at that $1,000, wipe off your chin, and feel humiliated.  We want them crawling through not even mousetraps at this point, rat traps.  It's got to be something even better.  Horrific or humiliating.  You're just too nice, Tom.  For me.  Yeah.  You're too nice.  Hey, just have someone call.  Come up with the humiliation.  We'll see if we can find a sponsor for that. 
[00:51:30]  So you just want us to give away the $1,000 every day next week?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Now we've got to think.  We're not used to this.  No, you don't.  Huh?  Don't make it harder on yourself than you need to.  No, because we want to give the people good radio.  Yeah, it's got to sound good.  $1,000.  $1,000 gets people in to do things that sounds really fun on the air.  That may get a fire, too.  Yeah, I know.  That's always fun.  He's thinking 10 steps ahead.  He's like, look, just take a call.  You can't get in trouble with just taking a call.  He agrees with some of the stuff we were talking about yesterday.  Like, you know, just take the 100th caller and give them $1,000. 
[00:52:00]  No, you don't have to take a numbered caller.  You get somebody who you like during the morning.  You just say.  I like Club Soda Kenny.  Can I hand him $1,000?  How about Steve from Yellowstone?  I've given Kenny enough money.  And Steve from Yellowstone is a great caller.  We're fine.  Ramone, give me a grand.  We've got to do something with the money.  How about a fun contest that won't get anybody in trouble?  Like, maybe we have a bunch of listeners come in, and they all bounce a ball.  How about this?  Who's happy?  It's for clerks, too.  So can we hide, like, $1,000 in a 7-Eleven and then just tell all our listeners to go find it? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  It's in a magazine.  Yeah, that old gag where they rip apart a store.  It's in the bra of one of the patrons.  You know, we tried to do that with WBCN in Boston.  I forgot exactly what it was.  We had an amazing prize.  I forgot what the prize was.  Maybe there were tickets to something really good.  And we wanted to hide them in a library.  Yep.  You can't do that stuff.  And they couldn't believe that we actually suggested this.  No. 
[00:53:00]  And we started promoting it kind of on the air that we're going to announce a library.  And then this, what was the prize, Ant?  Do you remember?  It was something really huge.  They were like Pearl Jam tickets or something.  Nah, maybe.  Really not.  I thought they were like really good tickets to a concert.  I don't remember.  Maybe Chachi could call up because he was beside himself going, what?  We can't do this.  They'll destroy the library.  Can we do a scavenger hunt?  No.  Okay.  How about we pick locations famous around New York City?  Yeah, that's great.  That's right. 
[00:53:30]  And people have to arm wrestle at him.  No churches, okay?  No.  Tom is panicking.  I don't have panicked.  Well, there's people outside of New York that want to win as well.  So we're going to try to figure out something.  That's true.  See, and that way if you get a great guy, I mean, it could be anybody from anywhere.  Can we do the money snatch?  Thank you, E-Rock.  Oh, wow.  We have been looking for the money snatch.  All right.  Anthony, why don't you explain the money snatch?  Oh, great.  I got to be the diplomat.  Tom, this is a great promotion. 
[00:54:00]  It evokes the old contests of the money in the cylinder that gets blown around by the air.  And then the people pluck.  You know, the famous morning zoo type contest.  They pluck the money out of the air.  Or they're in a bank vault.  Yeah, whatever they can bring out with them in a set amount of time, they get to keep.  It's the same thing as that.  Yeah, but it's only women.  But it's not.  But only women are involved.  Yeah.  So far, so good.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  He's still interested.  It scares me when you don't want to make eye contact.  So far, so good. 
[00:54:30]  He's looking at his tie talking.  So far, so good.  Him, not me.  Right.  The boring part of that, to me, has always been the fact that they are filling up a pocket  or their hands or something like that.  We take that out of the equation.  I get you.  I know where you're going here.  He had a real rough day yesterday.  And because it's only women that are involved in the contest, I know you understand, but some  of the listeners might not.  So I'll explain in a little more detail.  There's a special pocket.  God's pocket.  Yes. 
[00:55:00]  God's pocket.  God's pocket.  Where, of course, if they could carry out as much money as they can, they get to keep  it.  Let me get back to you on that.  No.  All right.  That was it.  How can we word this?  The only reason we talk to you pocket.  We're not describing the pocket.  No.  We're not describing God's pocket.  No, of course not.  Basically, well, I'm going to blow it, Anthony.  You're much better at describing this stuff.  It was fine.  Don't blow it. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Continue.  I did.  He said no.  What's left?  The guy knows exactly what the bid is and has said no.  Why no?  Why no?  Yeah.  What is the thing with that?  You've got to be kidding.  Why no?  We've done it already.  We're not going to describe anything.  Yeah.  It was already.  We did it.  We did it in any W.  That's right.  Geez.  People close while they're doing this.  Ken Stevens let us do it.  If the women want to wear it.  Look at what Ken is.  Ken with that.  Ken was a good friend of mine. 
[00:56:00]  If the women want to wear socks, then yes, they will have some type of clothing on.  They'll be wearing socks, a cummerbund, and a hat.  That's what they get.  So is the problem any type of unclothed women?  The company has a policy.  A policy.  It's a new policy on nudity in the studios.  We call it the O&A policy.  Oh, the O&A policy.  Yeah, we start a lot of policies, unfortunately.  So does that include, like, all nudity, top and bottom, or just bottomless nudity is forbidden? 
[00:56:30]  Or is it also, like, topless?  Yeah.  All.  How about we...  All.  So women can't even be braless in here?  Oh, come on.  No.  See, that's silly.  How about this?  Even if it's not photographed at all?  You're the stand-up guy.  Yes, it is silly.  How about this?  We'll take your money.  You got yelled at me.  We'll take your money.  We'll promote clerks, too, and then we'll do the thing over at the other joint.  I don't think that'll work.  Why not?  Because you get what you want.  You get the promotion and the money.  Because you're probably getting more besides $1,000 a day, aren't you? 
[00:57:00]  We're not getting $1,000 a day.  We're giving the listeners $1,000 a day.  But you're getting something on top of that to promote clerks, too?  There has to be something coming to us in order for us to finance that.  How about Run Around the Park for...  Run Around Park for Emily.  Another contest we wanted to do, and the lawyers said no to back in the day.  Yeah.  Very innocent concept.  Run Around Park for Emily.  Who's Emily? 
[00:57:30]  Just a name I pulled out of the hat.  You're right.  Just a very innocent concept.  People had a problem with the name of the contest and the act.  Well, the original name they didn't like, so we changed it to Run Around Park for Emily.  It was originally Run Around Park for Erin.  Right.  But now it's Run Around Park Emily.  Or Run Around Park Eric.  Yeah.  See?  We're not stuck on the actual name Emily.  It could be Eric.  It could be Erin. 
[00:58:00]  It could be Evan.  It's just the way it looks, though, if you write it down and line up all the first letters.  It's an awful contest that I've never sanctioned.  I don't agree with that contest either.  I don't agree with it.  I thought it was...  Voice of reason.  I thought it was fun.  You are the homeowner here.  We're just going to set a certain person, whether it's a girl or a guy, loose in Central Park,  and you've got to find this person, and they have the $1,000 on their person.  Once again, you're probably creating what they would consider a public nuisance by having 
[00:58:30]  people run around the park like crazy.  We know what happens whenever we relinquish command of this program to outside people.  It goes well.  We get fired.  It's a sleep late.  How about something like, I'm just curious, not that we would do this, maybe, maybe not,  I don't know, but something like, do you remember the 55-gallon drum challenge?  It's a lot like Fear Factor.  We put girls, again, girls, but they were in bikinis, in 55-gallon drums, about five of 
[00:59:00]  them or so, and then we would just throw the most heinous things on top of them, from live  eels to crickets to rotting beef intestines and things like that, and the last one left  in the barrel wins, because a lot of these girls just go, and freak out and run, but  it's cool.  It sounds like a serial killer's basement.  You hear that muffled in the barrel kind of screaming from the girls, and there's holes  in the barrel, so they, well, obviously there are, and so they could breathe, and you can 
[00:59:30]  photograph them, no nudity, great sounds coming out of it, no real danger that a disclaimer  or some kind of written little waiver won't handle, something like that.  Do we have any sounds from a past 55-gallon drum challenge that we could, uh...  You are really putting your rock on the spot.  Oh, I understand.  You want to take a picture with Tom, Eric?  So you could put your head into his head.  Here's his picture with the...  Oh, just look at this ass.  Look at how he's trying so hard to look like he really knows her. 
[01:00:00]  Is he good-looking in person, by the way?  I asked that already.  Yeah, sure.  Listen to the show, will you?  He takes a good picture.  I know I do listen to the show.  I wanted to see his reaction.  I mean, I'm listening to every minute of the show.  Yeah, I know you do.  Trust me, your job depends on it.  You don't think we know that?  I think he's interested so far in that, because there's nothing in there that's like a...  Yeah, the 55-gallon drum challenge was always something fun that we did. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  What about something like blind boxing?  Blind boxing we did.  We had two blind guys come up.  We set up like a little boxing ring, and they would box each other based on nothing but sound.  And they'd start wailing at like the crowd, people that had gathered around.  It was very funny.  They couldn't see each other.  It was even better when only one of them was blind.  It ended so quickly, though.  Connie and Carlo match another knockout blow.  You had a blind man, and then you blindfolded somebody. 
[01:01:00]  Well, you could do that.  Wow, that'd be nice.  Then the blind guy definitely has the advantage, because he's used to just going by sound.  He could use his senses.  Yes.  Spidey senses.  Did you tell Tom about the problem we had with that contest?  The broken ribs and the bruised spleen?  Well, that's because one of our contestants was drunk, and he wasn't able to defend himself,  and he wound up getting a bruised spleen.  And a few broken ribs.  Broken ribs.  And possibly a punctured lung.  Boxing is an issue.  I mean, I actually had to get a boxing.  I was a licensed boxing promoter at one point in the state of New Jersey. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, you had to be to do some promotions.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah, because the stations were getting in trouble for having that slap thing.  Right.  Hot 97.  Hot 97, the slap fest that they were doing, which, by the way, I saw a video of, and it  was hysterical.  One of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Two of these big, big women just smacking each other in the face.  All right, listen.  Paul in New York, what do you got?  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  It's fun.  Thank you, Tom.  Thanks, Tom.  That was great. 
[01:02:00]  Nice tie, too.  Appreciate it.  Pink is so in with guys these days.  Guys aren't afraid to wear pink.  It's the power color, right?  It is, right?  It's all about pink if you're an executive.  It says I'm secure with myself.  Right.  And I live in Chelsea.  By the way, if I can do this.  Oh, no.  Yes, please.  He's coming back.  No, I got it.  Give me a compliment.  Ooh, quiet.  A friend of mine came to me and said that your show, on Showtime.  Oh, no.  It's the best thing he's ever seen.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  See?  Oh, no. 
[01:02:30]  On Showtime.  Oh, no.  He's on HBO.  No, I know that.  But his friend didn't.  No, no.  No, my friend did, too.  Oh.  Oh.  See, Showtime's a Viacom company.  Oh, it is.  No, okay.  Hey, we're all separate entities now, my friend.  CBS, Viacom.  No, absolutely.  He told me it's just the funniest thing on TV at the moment.  Oh, thanks, man.  I thought you'd like that.  Cool.  Look at that.  A little heel-o-y on it.  A compliment.  Tom, hold on one second.  Paul in New York.  Pink says, I'm comfortable with myself. 
[01:03:00]  All right, Paul, we got $1,000.  We'll give it away Monday.  What do you got?  I'd like to come in and offer up my hairy back.  How hairy is your back, first of all?  Hold on.  How hairy is your back?  I'm not quite Wookie level, but it's pretty hairy.  Pretty bad?  And you want to do what?  Well, in O.P. killing a mouse style, I'd like to throw some mouse paper on my back.  Oh, that sticky mouse where they get caught in it?  Yeah, let's take it all off one fell swoop.  Will you allow that? 
[01:03:30]  What's that?  Probably.  I mean, I've got to get the lawyers.  You'll sign anything, right, Paul?  Yeah, sure.  Basically, you'll get your back waxed with mouse paper.  I've used the mouse paper.  It's brutal.  It gets really sticky and...  Beyond sticky.  It's more gooey than anything.  I think it'll...  I say...  You can rip hairs out, but it's going to leave you all sticky.  I say yes to this.  Paul, can you do it Monday?  Monday.  I could be there Monday.  What time?  Freaking six in the morning.  I don't care. 
[01:04:00]  I'm there.  You're going to have a lot of paperwork to sign.  I am there.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We'll get your info.  Can we make that happen, Tom?  I think the chances are real good, yes.  All right.  There you go.  Our first $1,000 we'll give away to Paul.  And check on the 55-gallon drum thing.  Yes, sir.  Let's see if we can do that.  That's a good one.  My to-do list?  Your to-do list.  My honey-do list?  Thank you.  And make sure you hit the range many times in the next week.  I will.  All right.  I absolutely will.  All right.  You've got to play with him.  I know.  What? 
[01:04:30]  We're doing a golf outing for a charity, for Joel Hollander's charity.  Yeah.  And it's going to be Opie, Tom Chiasano, who else?  Scott Herman.  Scott Herman, our old GM, and I think Les Hollander.  And some.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to be with you.  I was going to say some schmo.  No.  Maybe Les was with me.  I remember somebody saying that they're not that good, so they're with me.  Who are you with?  I don't know.  I'm going to be with some hacks, though. 
[01:05:00]  I got to be.  I'm not as good as Opie.  Opie's a really good golfer.  No, I'm not good anymore.  Ah, shut up.  I'm not good anymore.  I'm telling you.  I haven't played in two years.  And this is where Phil.  Phil Simms?  Yeah.  And Boomer Siasan.  Oh, it's like a celebrity golf thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  You going?  I'm not playing, but I'll go.  You won't play.  No, I have a picture with Boomer I want signed, and I want to get a picture with Phil.  Am I playing?  How about this?  No.  I've never played golf in my life, and I'm not going to now. 
[01:05:30]  You have to try.  No.  I don't try.  All right, we've got to try alone.  Not when quarterbacks and other people are watching.  Very nerve-wracking.  Oh, you're a nothing kid.  Let's take a break.  We'll get into some things afterwards.  See, it's $1,000 a day.  I mean, it's boring to just give it to a caller.  No, you've got to have people come up here and earn it.  I know radio has lost its balls, but we can still do some fun things with $1,000 a day.  And don't worry.  We're going to work around that new thing.  We've got chicks in here. 
[01:06:00]  Or we'll just save it for XM.  I don't give a crap.  By the way, that mouse thing we shouldn't do because all the guys are going to do is scream.  It's the One Virus spreading across America.  What is this?  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks. 
[01:06:30]  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to get you.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks, call him.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing. 
[01:07:00]  At least they're not funding terrorism.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Laura Stillwagon, 24, from Glen Cove.  She's in New York Newsday today.  They do a hotspot review thing.  And she talked very highly about my brother's restaurant. 
[01:07:30]  I know people are sick of hearing about my brother's restaurant, but this is really, really cool.  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  Laura writes, Riley's not only offers a wicked good time, but a slamming menu of fine American cuisine.  Tom's going to charge me for this.  I know it.  But it's in the newspaper.  I've got to read this.  They'll just sue you after they fire us.  It says, have the mac and cheese and stay the evening for martinis, beer, and laughs.  The prices aren't obscenely rude. 
[01:08:00]  The ambiance is casual, and you may even run into Opie and Anthony from XM slash CBS Radio.  Opie's brother owns the joint.  My only complaint, it's a small location, but I'd rather be a little smushed with the laid-back, respectful patrons here  than trapped in a dance hall with sloppy, underage, fist-pumping, riff-raff.  So thank you to Laura Stillwagon.  That is very, very cool.  And you will run into us tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow night we're doing late-night karaoke at FH Riley's Huntington Village. 
[01:08:30]  Yes, Kenny?  Yeah, Tom won't be mad.  CBS is a big part of karaoke night Friday night.  I heard they bailed because they didn't have enough time.  No, I spoke to Tom this morning, and CBS is behind karaoke night 50%.  Now I'm trying to get XM to come up with the other 50%.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because, well, we need security and all sorts of stuff.  We're getting prizes.  We have prizes, and maybe we'll bring some of that cash over.  Yeah, maybe some of that cash? 
[01:09:00]  No, we have no idea.  Honestly, we're just going to hang with the listeners and have some fun.  That's it.  Late-night karaoke at my brother's joint.  A couple of shots tomorrow night.  Shots?  Yes.  I understand.  We'll be handing out T-shirts.  I know how to get people down.  You're terrific, Jimmy.  I'm good.  I know how to motivate people.  When you hand them out, they should be called T-shirts.  Or T-soul shirts.  He has one.  So we don't even have to promote it because it is a small joint,  and I'm sure it's going to be crowded already, but there you have it. 
[01:09:30]  I can't think of a song.  I personally will never sing.  I don't sing.  Well, if not even Sabbath.  No, especially not Sabbath.  You wouldn't want to desecrate it like that.  Of course not.  I'm going to sing War Pigs.  I'm sure my brother's working on his latest creation.  He was a hit last time with Bubba is a C.  Well, yeah.  That was very memorable.  All right.  We got a Barbaro update today.  Barbaro.  I got some observations. 
[01:10:00]  Ant's got some observations.  But here's the latest on Barbaro.  He won the Kentucky Derby, obviously, and he broke his leg during the pregness, right?  Right.  Barbaro's condition took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, when tests revealed a bacterial  infection had spread to the hind leg that isn't broken.  Barbaro's condition is potentially serious, and we are aggressively seeking all treatment  options, his chief surgeon said in a statement.  Barbaro's jockey, Edgar Prado, tells Good Morning America he's nervous. 
[01:10:30]  Things have not gone right so far.  He's been having some problems, you know, with the leg that he got injured, and now the leg  too.  Prado was riding Barbaro back on May 20th, when the Kentucky Derby winning Colt took a stunning  tumble just a few seconds into the pregness.  This horse is so dead, it's not even funny.  They should have put him down when he broke his leg at the pregness right away, so the thing  wouldn't suffer, but the thing is worth millions and millions of dollars, so they're keeping  it alive just to try to get as much you-know-what out of him. 
[01:11:00]  That's what they're doing.  There's a guy with a glove on in there every day, and the horse is probably like, wow,  breaking your leg isn't so bad.  This is fantastic.  That's what's going on, because the stud fees have got to be ridiculous for a horse like  that.  They're probably 50 bucks, maybe 100.  Could be a little more than that, Jim.  And that's probably why he's taking a turn for the worse.  He's probably, at this point, so weak from what they're doing to him.  He has no energy at all.  Right.  Yeah.  He's like La Mata.  He's trying to dump ice water. 
[01:11:30]  Dehydrated.  He's just like, no, not again.  Get away.  Here comes the guy with a glove and a bucket.  No fooling around.  I told you.  No fooling around.  I've got to fight the infection.  See, this is the type of things we want to know.  Why doesn't the news take this angle?  What's going on after hours?  Are they doing that to him?  Of course they are.  They've got to be.  Of course they are.  Because this horse is never going to run again.  No.  And you've got to think the bills are ridiculous to keep this horse alive.  So they're thinking, all right, it's worth it because we're going to get this out of 
[01:12:00]  him.  Bunch of buckets with cellophane.  It looks like a tapioca pudding factory.  They're all in a closet.  His leg mobilized by a titanium plate and 27 screws, Barbaro seemed to be healing nicely.  But 10 days ago, the colt developed a fever and an infection in both hind legs.  The vets performed surgery to remove the infection, but apparently it has returned.  It is a very significant problem, and it's very concerning. 
[01:12:30]  Something about this champion's plight struck a chord with the public.  Letters and cards are still pouring into his hospital.  What is he going to read of you dummies?  Letters and cards are pouring in.  Dear horse, eat this.  People are so stupid.  And the news is stupid.  Something.  That something was we were all watching the Preakness and saw the horse break his leg live  on TV, and we all went, holy crap, did you see that?  Who's writing cards and letters to his hospital? 
[01:13:00]  Dear Barbaro, I loves your cousin and the godfather.  Get well soon.  Your grandson, Frank.  Stinks.  Two infected legs, and he's still alive.  Dave, just shows you how stupid this country is.  There are actually people out there writing letters to a horse to get better.  Men are coming here to kill my horse.  I want you to stand outside and watch the door. 
[01:13:30]  I thought I got all you guinea jockeys locked up.  This is the attitude.  Here's Greg in Philly.  Listen to this real fast.  Greg.  Oh, you know what?  Let this thing suffer as long as possible.  And then make sure it dies.  Because the only letter I'm going to send is an anthrax letter.  How much money we lost from the bet that's raised.  How much money we lost.  Unbelievable.  He was favored.  Yeah, he cost a lot of people a lot of money.  A lot of people lost some money on that one. 
[01:14:00]  That is the reality.  Of accord with the public.  Letters and cards are still pouring into his hospital.  But if Barbaro's condition doesn't improve, the team caring for him will have some tough decisions to make.  Tough decisions.  If it's like he cannot live comfortably, they will go ahead and decide to have him put down.  Kill him.  Before this setback, Vets had pegged Barbaro's odds of survival at 50-50.  Today, they'll announce their new prognosis. 
[01:14:30]  For Good Morning America, Nancy Weiner, ABC News, New York.  Weiner.  He's dead by the end of the week.  Oh.  Dead by Monday.  I think he's going to make your money.  Barbaro.  Barbaro.  I'm not going to race him.  I'm going to put him out to stud with no legs, two wheels strapped to his butt.  That's right.  Like Heather Mills.  I'm just going to have him go in circles.  You know what you ought to do?  You ought to pick up a saw and then say there's going to be four really lucky people with something to hang over their doorways. 
[01:15:00]  I'd sell those little stupid shoes.  I'd make my money in shoe sales.  They've got to figure, I guess, the medical cost offset by the blacksmith charges that they're going to save on.  50% off.  Let's say hi to Charlie.  Charlie.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Hey, Charlie.  For the horse to be...  They took my hoof, Charlie.  Absolutely.  They took my hoof. 
[01:15:30]  I'm thinking of the exact same thing.  Wow.  Yes, Charlie.  Sorry.  Yeah, for the horse to be registered and race, the babies, Barbaro has to stand stud, so he'll have to mount the mare.  Wait, it can't just be done artificially?  No, it can't be done artificially.  For the baby to be a registered horse and to race, he has to stand stud.  He has to do it himself.  Because then they'd be like genetically probably doing all kinds of crazy stuff. 
[01:16:00]  Well, how come I've heard of people using artificial insemination to make race horses?  They can do that, but the horse isn't a registered thoroughbred, and it's not...  I mean, there's other races where you can race any horse, but I guess, you know, for the sanctioning, he has to stand stud.  Oh, so they're really freaking out, because they're trying to get this horse healthy enough to actually mate.  He needs his back leg.  What, are they going to put him in a big harness like Patrice O'Neal talking about his sex harness? 
[01:16:30]  They'll just hang him up in one of those big harnesses.  Hey, what are you doing?  My legs hurt.  Wow, we learned something new today.  I had no idea about that.  I didn't know about that.  Excuse me?  I didn't know about all that paperwork and the technicalities.  Yeah, we had no idea.  Okay, guys, punch it out.  Thank you.  All right, bye-bye.  All right.  Yeah, I guess the old turkey baster thing don't count.  Wow, how about if they just want to send the guy with the glove in to make really expensive shakes?  Let's say...  That would be a great contest. 
[01:17:00]  Drink this for $1,000, you silly goose.  And a $5 milkshake?  Yeah, what would you do for $1,000 cash?  Travis is still taking your phone calls.  Let's say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  Big fan.  Hoo-hoo.  Just wanted to...  I'm down here in South Jersey, and they've run with this Barbaro story.  This stupid horse snapped its leg.  They go with it over murders in Philadelphia.  It's amazing.  Of course.  That's what the news does.  The big story.  They will go with this story if this thing takes a dump before they go with crazy stuff. 
[01:17:30]  My wife and I just go crazy.  You're in South Jersey?  Yeah, right.  I think this horse is...  It's stationed, or whatever the hell it is.  It's just in South Philadelphia, South PA.  Like, kind of square.  So they go with it like it's like the freaking Eagles playing a football game.  It's crazy.  You know, if we teach you guys one thing throughout this run is that the news is ridiculous.  Your newspapers are ridiculous.  Your local news should not even be called news anymore.  It should be called an entertainment program. 
[01:18:00]  It's a kind of almost reality program.  You want to hear the front page of the New York Post today?  There's three stories with equal billing on the front page of the New York Post.  Actually, not even equal billing, because the top half of the Post, Christy Brinkley, marriage shocker.  She's getting a divorce.  Wow.  That is on the front page of the New York Post.  Whoa, I can't believe it.  Sharing space with that headline, Michael Strahan's XXX home video secret.  What's the deal there, by the way, Anthony? 
[01:18:30]  He was secretly taping his...  Allegedly.  Ex-wife's sister, allegedly.  The wife is making allegations in court that before they were married, he had bought a bunch of video equipment,  one of which was a clock radio with a camera in it, and put it in the room that the sister would stay in and get naked.  And the wife is alleging that he took videos of her.  And her proof that she says is the fact that one time Strahan paid her off something like $30,000 out of nowhere. 
[01:19:00]  And she said that was a payment to keep her quiet and settle her down.  Settle down and keep the relationship going after you videotape the girl's sister.  So, shouldn't that tell you right there, maybe this guy ain't the guy for me?  Right.  And if you do go with him, doesn't it show that maybe you're a little bit of a gold digger?  Yeah, it's your problem at that point.  Yeah.  You know what you're getting into.  Who knows?  At this point, who do you believe?  She seems like a complete kook. 
[01:19:30]  But Michael seems like he's had some things going on as well.  Without getting into it all again, you know, I went through a divorce, and it just sucks.  The lawyers suck.  Everybody's an ass, and it's a horrible thing.  But there's something that made me prejudiced, something, maybe getting screwed over, where I read certain things and just laugh my ass off.  And one of them was Michael Strahan listening to his wife's testimony yesterday, and she's saying that they were trying to get pregnant. 
[01:20:00]  And at that time, that sensitive time where she's trying to get pregnant, Michael's trying to lower her prenuptial agreement and take money off it.  So she's on the stand crying, and Michael Strahan, while his wife is on the stand crying about not being able to get pregnant, turns to the media booth where all the media is and just starts laughing, laughing, laughing, and they're snapping pictures of him laughing as his wife is crying on the stand about how she couldn't get pregnant. 
[01:20:30]  You've got to love it.  You've got to love it.  Good for him.  Love Strahan.  So that's the latest on Michael Strahan.  So you've got Christy Brinkley, the top half of the cover of the New York Post.  Who they were calling the gap-toothed gridiron great.  These posts have got to come up with these.  So you've got Christy Brinkley getting a divorce.  You've got Michael Strahan's thing.  And then you've got Act of War, of course, the Israeli thing.  Oh, and then we've got the beginning of World War III, which I think should be a top story. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, that shares the front page of the Post with Christy Brinkley and Michael Strahan.  These dopes.  And then the death toll in India, I guess, continues to rise drastically.  Oh, yeah?  Where's the latest on that in the New York Post?  What are we up to?  Let me see.  India.  India.  India.  Let's see.  India.  Holy crap.  I don't even think it's in the paper anymore.  Where are we?  It was old news.  It just happened.  India.  India. 
[01:21:30]  Someone call Dell Customer Support and see if anyone answers.  That'll gauge on how many Indians died in that crash.  India.  Bastards.  India.  Holy crap.  I'm not kidding.  I don't even think the New York Post is covering it.  Hello.  My name is Mitch.  How can I help you?  Your name's not Mitch.  You're not in Chicago.  You're nowhere in the United States.  No, I am Mitch.  How could I help with your Dell order?  No.  Hello.  My name is Peter.  No, it's not.  It's Uber Looba. 
[01:22:00]  Hate that.  They lie to you right off the bat.  Oh, my God.  And by the way, Christy Brinkley's going through a fourth divorce, and the two of her and her  husband have a daughter, Sailor Lee, and a son, Jack Paris.  She must, um...  Sailor Lee is the daughter's name.  My brother named his daughter Sailor.  No, he didn't.  I swear to God.  No, I don't buy it.  And he loves this program. 
[01:22:30]  It's a good show.  So why don't you talk to my brother right now?  He's listening.  What do you call that for short?  Admiral?  He was just trying to come up with different names for his kids instead of the same old,  same old.  Absolutely.  And look, I have nothing against sailors.  I mean, you know, there's a team in New York here all the time.  Well, there's no coverage in the New York Post on the terrorist act here in India.  But moving back to the Strayhand thing, Andrea Pizer, she's just terrific with her column. 
[01:23:00]  Her headline is, Pervert Giants, a horse's rear end.  But end, because he was at end in defensive end.  Right, right.  Patoot.  A horse's patoot.  No, end ties in with football.  Right, it does.  And she put it like in the one quote.  She is just not happy.  Clear the courtroom and hide the kids.  The divorce battle between Giants defensive end Michael Strahan and his lovely bride Jean. 
[01:23:30]  Lovely.  She's already...  Have you been following this case?  She's not that lovely.  She's already slanting the story.  She married a guy who used to come in and get hand treatments.  Right.  Oh, yeah, that's true love.  Wait, what?  She worked in some, like, upper...  Some salon.  And he would go in there and get, like, these hand treatments.  Whatever, he would buy, like, skin products.  Oh, I thought she was giving the hand treatments.  No, not hand treatments like that.  Oh, not the...  Well, when Jim talks about hand treatments, what am I supposed to think?  No, I thought the same thing.  Actually, he's getting his hands nicely lube. 
[01:24:00]  Exfoliation type stuff.  Oh, that's not what I'm thinking when it comes out of your mouth.  And Strahan's, you know, not a bad looking guy.  But let's be honest, you know, that big monster walking in with six, five, this big man-tackling  hands going, could you scrub these?  It's not exactly marriage material right off the bat.  Oh, man.  He was a football player and made millions.  Well, Andrea is not happy in the post today.  Clear the courtroom and hide the kids.  The divorce battle between Giants defensive end, Michael Strahan, and his lovely bride,  Jean, devolved yesterday into a sordid suburban saga of liposuction, lies, and videotape. 
[01:24:30]  Can we stop the blomp, blomp, and videotape thing?  The duh, duh, and videotape.  How old is that movie?  Yeah, I have a head.  Old.  Beautiful Jean Strahan sat up straight.  She's lovely and beautiful.  Sat up straight in the witness chair in her expensive off-white suit and tousled mane of  North Dakota grown hair.  Jean claimed that Michael secretly videotaped Jean's sister undressing in a guest bedroom of 
[01:25:00]  the house they shared in Pennsylvania in 1997 before they were married.  Before they were married.  So she left him.  Good boy.  Wait, this was before you said all this?  Before they were married.  Good for Michael.  So she left him.  So why'd she come back?  She came back.  Like you said, you've got to know what you're getting into at that point, you gold digger.  Well, why wouldn't she come back?  Because she's saying that she came back, or they're saying.  She came back after Michael wired $30,000 into Jean's bank account.  So he was like, look, I'll give you 30 G's, you come back. 
[01:25:30]  And Andrea has nothing to say about that?  That's kind of weird.  No, then she went off.  She was going to go further, but the judge upheld an objection.  Court observers waited with obscene interest to hear if the money was meant for Jean or  was intended to silence her poor semi-dressed sister.  Jean managed to shriek, no, when her lawyer, Ellen Marshall, asked if the money was for  her.  But the judge cut her off saying, this tidbit was irrelevant to the divorce case, so how  could Jean have forgiven Michael? 
[01:26:00]  I must have been in a bad place in my mind, Jean told me later.  Or, unknown is the location of Jean's brain when she discovered two years into their relationship  that Michael was still married to his first wife, and the wife had just given birth.  Yeah, see?  This woman is stupid.  All right, he's a scumbag, but this woman is stupid for sticking with this guy.  He's just being a guy.  Why would she stay with him? 
[01:26:30]  Money.  It was all about the money.  All about the cash, and now she's trying to get even more.  Why the hell did you go and marry him, I asked her.  This is Andrea in the Post.  I loved him, she told me.  The straight-hand divorce may be the most raucous entertainment ever to hit the Newark  family court.  We also were treated to the news that in 2001, Michael underwent...  Can we say this word?  He wanted to get some analysis done because she was not getting pregnant.  Yeah.  He wanted it to be analyzed on his end.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  He probably tested her as well.  Make sure, you know, because it does take a man and a woman to make a baby, and they  both need certain parts that work properly.  So the guy goes in there and gets his little swimmies counted.  Make sure she can be fertilized.  Yeah.  It says Michael underwent blank analysis.  Use your favorite word in that blank.  Tadpole analysis.  Tadpole analysis.  Mayonnaise analysis.  It was a really weird analysis.  It was done in the back seat of a vehicle, and we asked the girl, are you testing it? 
[01:27:30]  And she went...  Anyway, that's just terrific.  But no sign of what's going on in India, the latest.  Yeah, and the Israelis are attacking Beirut.  You just don't screw with the Israelis, man.  Why are you kidnapping Israeli soldiers?  It's the same day.  It's the same day.  Like, I like the way we respond sometimes, but it usually takes too long. 
[01:28:00]  They just, the same day, just start bombing the crap out of stuff.  Cutting countries in half.  Blowing up bridges.  Blowing up headquarters of Palestinian leadership.  Oh, it's great.  They're kidnapping Israelis.  You can't kidnap the soldiers of another army and not have it be declared an act of war.  Nope.  And that's exactly how they're looking at it.  And now they have, now they're fighting on two fronts. 
[01:28:30]  Now they got Lebanon.  They'll smash both of them.  That they're fighting on.  And the thing is, you know, it's kind of like the Israelis pulled out of the strip, the Gaza strip.  And instantly, what went there?  Was it Palestinians going, thank God they, you know, opened up the Gaza Strip for us.  We're going to settle here and build.  They put outposts and locations so they could shoot mortars into Israel.  It's not like they gave them the land back to build on or to act civilized on. 
[01:29:00]  They used that land that was then given back to them in a pretty good gesture to just set up outposts and mortars to fire into Israel.  It's this, there's no reasoning with these people.  That's what people don't understand.  There's no reasoning.  You don't go, look, we'll make a deal.  You can't deal with people that just want you destroyed.  And that's pretty much what they're doing.  My friend's sister is Israeli. 
[01:29:30]  And she's a translator.  And she works like, she's translated like stuff with Arafat.  Like she's on that level as a translator.  And she was in on a lot of the meetings they had.  Like the highest level you can go.  Arafat and whoever in Israel he was talking to.  And she was a very liberal Israeli.  She was very, for an Israeli, apparently very pro-Palestinian.  And she felt that they were wrong.  The Israelis were wrong.  Her own people were wrong.  And she said after she sat through those meetings, she actually called my friend's boyfriend, who was a, you know, owner of a comedy club, arch-conservative, and said, you're right, Arafat's a pig. 
[01:30:00]  They offered him everything and he turned it down because he wanted it to keep going.  Because it has nothing to do with solving the problem.  And believe me, the Israelis aren't all innocent in this whole thing either.  Of course not.  But they've been trying to grab up as much land as they can since the 40s in Israel.  They will use any excuse.  You know, some guy stole a pack of gum from the store. 
[01:30:30]  We'll take that block.  We need a 15-mile buffer.  Buffer zone.  What happened?  It was a guy.  His feet smelled.  Buffer zone.  They don't want a solution to the problem.  They want and what they want.  And it's the same thing that we're dealing with with terrorism.  It's not this compromising thing or the way we look in the world and how they view us.  There's this hatred of anybody that isn't Muslim and that doesn't follow this Islamic guideline. 
[01:31:00]  And they look at that and say these people, their belief is that they must be destroyed.  Look at the president of Iran.  The president of Iran is saying that Israel will be wiped off the map.  What other presidents are talking about?  How do you deal with that and try to bargain with it?  It's like that scene in The Terminator.  You can't be reasoned with.  You can't be bargained with.  It's The Terminator.  It's here to kill you.  It's a machine.  Let's say hi to Mohammed in San Antonio.  Mohammed.  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Hey, Mohammed. 
[01:31:30]  I'm going to take a guess as to what side of this issue you're on.  Let's guess.  But let's give him his time.  Go ahead, Mohammed.  Okay.  Well, you have to be, first of all, a Palestinian to know how the life is over there.  You say they pulled out of Gaza and we're supposed to thank them and everything is dandy.  Who controls the borders?  Nobody can get out.  Nobody can get into the Gaza Strip.  The life is horrible over there.  I'm not saying they should thank them.  Okay, that's silly. 
[01:32:00]  But what they shouldn't do is then use that land.  How about something called a good gesture?  How about using the land to live on instead of setting up listening posts and rocket bases and launching missiles into another country?  Okay, but the missiles that you're speaking of, you have to kind of look at it on a day-to-day basis.  This is that they gave back the land, okay?  They still continued with their targeted assassinations of Palestinians.  But that's in response to the fact that it's a terrorist organization that is now in charge. 
[01:32:30]  Of course they're going to eliminate the leadership.  They're the ones sending bombs into buses and ordering missiles to be launched into the country.  But Hamas has said they would never accept Israel as a country.  Right, and now they're running the show.  What do you expect?  I mean, I'm honestly asking you, what do you expect them to do when Hamas takes over and they're the ones who have been funding all these attacks  and they are open about having funded the attacks and they're saying we will never, we want the end of Israel. 
[01:33:00]  We will not accept them as a country.  How is Israel supposed to respond?  Do you really believe that Hamas has the power to end the Israeli state?  Do you know how powerful militarily they are?  Dude, no, no, I'm not saying they have the power to.  No, no, no, Mohammed, I'm not saying they have the power to.  What I'm saying is that they have said that they want the end of it.  So when attacks are coming and they're still sponsored by Hamas,  what is Israel supposed to do if not target the leaders of the organization?  Just because somebody wants the end of somebody doesn't justify just punishing the whole entire nation. 
[01:33:30]  No, I understand.  I don't think the whole nation should be punished.  But what I'm saying is Hamas has said that they want the end of Israel.  They're as militant as you can be.  And now they're running the show.  So when attacks are still coming on Israelis and you know Hamas is behind a lot of them  and the people who run Hamas are behind a lot of them,  what is Israel supposed to do if not respond by attacking those leaders?  I knew, you know, these problems have been going on for years and years  and it's not going to be solved on Anthony's show. 
[01:34:00]  And I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  Of course you love Jimmy.  Thanks, my husband.  Jimmy is a terrorist.  It's just a question.  I mean, it was just a legit question.  It is.  You know what the bottom line is with that whole situation?  It's almost the chicken-egg thing.  Like, both sides are guilty within reason.  Well, the answer is chicken, of course, because if you hold an egg and try to do that,  it slips out of your hand.  At least the chicken fluttered.  In some German videos, you're right.  We've got to take a break.  We're so late.  Oh, okay.  We're so late.  I'm going to go tink.  And I think Otto and George, are they here yet? 
[01:34:30]  Where's Otto?  No Otto and George yet?  Okay.  Find me, Otto!  I want to talk about Israel.  We've got to talk about the big dig in Boston there, the Ted Williams tunnel when we get  back.  That's a crazy situation.  Man Cow is, ooh, wants to make sure all his competitors are really scared out there.  We've got the latest from him.  We've got, uh...  Who?  Exactly.  We've got other things as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Go get my limo! 
[01:35:00]  I've got my hernius.  That makes me sound like a really talented comic.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Only creeps listen to this program.  That's right.  That's a bunch of lies.  Sit down and put on your laughing hat.  It's time for the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[01:35:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We must say hi to Boston today.  Everybody listening to us on WBCN, they're in hell up there.  This instant feedback says it all. 
[01:36:00]  It looks like Glenn in Massachusetts.  Does anybody realize the whole effing city of Boston is shut down because some a-hole thought  he could hold a couple of tons of concrete up in the air with some epoxy around the bolts?  Hanging a slab of rock over a highway seems like a real bad idea.  Yeah, yeah, good one.  I guess the Ted Williams tunnel there, going to Logan, is falling apart. 
[01:36:30]  They checked out a few more sections of it because a big section fell down, killed a woman in a car.  Tons of concrete fell down.  I guess the guy she was with, was that her husband or some guy?  He was able to crawl out, but she got squished underneath all this concrete.  You're just driving through a tunnel, trying to get somewhere, and a big chunk falls on you.  And the person you're with is dead.  Yeah.  Just thinks dead.  And, yeah, so they checked out some of the other parts of the tunnel to see if they were having the same kind of problem. 
[01:37:00]  Some kind of metal holding, some device that holds up the concrete.  It's like a metal, almost like a hook.  And they found ones that were failing.  Yeah, it's a complete mess.  So they've got to shut the tunnel down.  Now they're reporting 60 signs of loose bolts and other potential failures.  Found in the same big tunnel where a motorist was crushed by falling concrete.  So much corruption up there.  So much corruption as far as their construction goes. 
[01:37:30]  That goddamn Mass Pike Authority with their toll booths that were supposed to be gone once the highway was paid for.  It's been paid for 100 times over, and they're still sitting there because nepotism and corruption and politicians with their hands in each other's pockets and Kennedy and Menino and all of them, just the corruption that goes on.  And look at what happens. 
[01:38:00]  They have the hugest – one of the biggest civil projects in American history, the big dig, goes down.  The most expensive, anyway.  And what happens?  It's barely finished, and whammo, a piece comes down and crushes a woman.  It's already collapsing.  It's already falling apart.  And this is after they had all the reports of the leaks that were coming in.  Unbelievable.  Well, you came up with a good idea before the show, by the way.  Oh, the curse of Ted Williams?  It's the curse of Ted Williams' head. 
[01:38:30]  The curse of the Tedino?  Let me play the famous clip here.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Yes.  Ted Williams and his – well, just his head is –  Just his head is frozen.  Is still on ice somewhere.  You've got to bury his head.  Until you bury Ted's head, the Ted Williams tunnel will continue to kill.  It is a monster.  It is a killing machine.  Don't you dare, dare drive into the maw of the Ted Williams tunnel. 
[01:39:00]  Will you leave?  Will you make it through?  Who knows?  Until Ted's head is six feet under where it belongs, the threat is there, folks.  Ah, so people in Boston just losing their minds.  Attorney General Tom Riley said a contractor and project manager knew about the problems  in that section of the tunnel as early as 1999, seven goddamn years ago, with five bolts. 
[01:39:30]  I wonder what a contractor, gee.  And what'd they do?  Probably could figure out why it wasn't fixed.  Probably, hey, you know, that might cost a little extra.  We could shave the money off of that, add it on to this end, and that'll mean more for  this guy, who's a good friend of mine.  There you go.  Hey, moving on, what are the big stories in New York?  Really fast.  Off the top of your head, Anthony.  Even national stories, international stories.  Ed is still going with the stupid bomb, the blown up building.  Oh, God, we forgot about that. 
[01:40:00]  Dr. Boom.  Dr. Boom, they're still investigating.  Tornado touchdown.  There's two single tornado touchdown 20 miles north of Manhattan.  You got the terrorism in India.  A lot of things going on, right?  Israel is smashing everybody's face.  Right.  Well, the news just had a cute story about a two-headed cat, everybody.  Aww.  Well, you know, turns into newscaster improv, complete with meow sound effects.  That thing looks disgusting.  It looked like a hatchet was taken to its head. 
[01:40:30]  Yes, this is your news.  Did they do meow sounds?  Well, if that cat has nine lives, does this little kitty have 18?  Because two times nine.  Let me do the math.  Shut up.  Cronkite would have said that.  Yeah.  Maybe she should have said because of the danger of the two heads, does he have 4.5?  She did not add nine plus nine. 
[01:41:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hope.  They were showing pictures of this kitten, two-headed kitten, and it's not a two-headed kitten.  It's like two three-quarter heads stuck together, and it looks like it's split right down the middle.  Like it's all red and goopy.  Well, here's the story.  Well, if a cat has nine lives, does this little kitty have 18?  Check this out.  This cat was born with two faces.  The female, named Gemini, came into the world late Sunday night. 
[01:41:30]  Clever.  Four eyes and two noses are independent, but the two mouths appear to flow into one throat.  Yes, folks, I said it.  One throat.  So far, Gemini is doing fine and getting stronger every day.  Several vets say that they've never seen anything like this before.  If she does survive, the mate needs surgery to remove extra tissue between her two mouths.  But wait, aren't there two cats?  One throat, two cats? 
[01:42:00]  I could have sworn we've seen these cats before.  We have seen this cat before.  I remember.  It was like, maybe it was two mouths or something like that.  Oh, this is a new one.  Well, she was born on Sunday.  He was born on Sunday.  This is a new one.  But there is another cat out there.  Near which power plant?  Two three-year power plants.  Or which power lines?  Bears, Gemini.  But I think there should be two names.  I wonder if Jill has anything to say about this.  Jill, what do you think?  Wow, the crazy cat lady.  And someone's barking out here.  It's a meow, please.  I would love to take care of this cat. 
[01:42:30]  If anyone's watching, please bring it to my house to join all the hundreds of others I have.  It's a little thing.  So cute.  Couldn't they do something more valuable at that time?  Like sell an ad for adult diapers?  That's the point we're trying to do.  They are just worthless dummies.  I hate the news people.  They're so stupid.  Didn't they see cats like this before?  I don't know.  You're the media.  Why don't you investigate it?  It was born on Sunday. 
[01:43:00]  Who else gets that douche feeling when you know they're about to improv and it's going nowhere?  Grashing and burning.  I just feel it.  Here's how you can tell.  You hear this.  Yeah.  Didn't they, um, didn't they, um, didn't they, uh, uh-oh, shuffle, shuffle.  Here comes some fascinating dialogue, hon.  Set the Tivo.  Oh, didn't, wasn't it, uh, thanks, more papers, uh, born on Sunday?  Let's say hi to Greg in Westchester.  Greg.  Why would you ask that when you're supposed to be telling people the news?  You don't ask rhetorical questions. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Did Cronkite go, uh, I don't know.  Something happened in Dallas.  Wasn't the news bad?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Didn't his head come apart back there?  Who knows?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Uh, Greg, Westchester, go.  Hey, what's going on?  Uh, I was just letting you guys know that tornado you guys were talking about or mentioned for a minute.  It was pretty crazy, man.  It ripped through a town up there, Hawthorne, that I'm in.  In the words of Jim Norton, was it?  It was.  It was nuts, man.  It was nuts.  Yeah.  Just like the, uh, tornado alley there in the Midwest. 
[01:44:00]  Look, Greg, don't embarrass us.  Some trees.  We got a lot of listeners in the Midwest, uh, that, uh, are listening from Tornado Alley.  Where the hell that is.  A little siding, a little vinyl siding comes off.  Some trees come down.  A few cars get ruined.  But, really.  A tornado.  Local news did a whole two hours on it yesterday here in New York because of a tornado, uh, north of the city.  That affected, how many people did that tornado really affect?  Well, no one died, though.  That they had to eat up all the time.  I wanted to watch the insider to see what's going on with Tom Cruise's baby. 
[01:44:30]  Instead, I get tornado coverage.  Where's Surrey?  All right, guys.  I'm sorry, then.  Surrey Watch is up to, uh, day 86.  Day 86 on the Surrey Watch?  86 days, and we haven't seen Tom Cruise's kid yet.  But, uh, I didn't get to get the updates because I had to watch the tornado coverage.  It was terrific.  I gotta tell ya.  They showed power lines down, and they showed some trees on top of cars.  Isn't it just strong wind?  What do you mean?  On, on, on the east coast. 
[01:45:00]  Like, we don't really get tornadoes.  You can get some spinning wind.  No, they're starting to say that this was definitely a tornado.  It's rare, but, uh, it's happened.  Yeah?  It's happened in the past.  Very rare, though.  They call it tornadic.  What was it?  Tornadic.  Tornadic?  Tornadic action.  Tornadic activity.  Tornadic activity.  So.  You're right.  Diana Sawyer has the Vaseline lens going.  I mean, stop trying to soften this old bag.  She's 78.  They really are.  Stop trying to be sexy with your red lipstick and your little blonde wig. 
[01:45:30]  God, is that irritating.  She has hair like E-Rock.  Really annoys me.  You look like Diana Sawyer.  Oh, where is he?  He's on camera.  You never see them both at the same time.  Absolutely.  You're right.  Let's go to Anthony and, uh, Hawthorn.  Hawthorn.  Hawthorn.  What's up, guys?  How you doing there, Anthony?  Who is the rich ass that decided it has to be called Hawthorn?  Hawthorn.  I have no clue.  Fred or Pete Hawthorn?  Some ass that went to prep school.  The Hawthorn family? 
[01:46:00]  Let's make it difficult to say for everybody.  Hawthorn.  Hawthorn.  Oh, what?  W, a T, and an H in a row.  Uh, let's see.  Yeah, let's go, Anthony.  Sorry.  Anyways, I'm sorry.  Uh, I was on the conic, actually, heading north when it happened.  I actually, uh, I was kind of in it, I guess.  Yeah.  I'm sitting there, and all of a sudden it starts downpouring, and I'm like, all right, whatever.  All of a sudden cars start pulling over, and I'm like, oh, you know, this doesn't really  happen that much where people start stopping in the middle of the conic.  So everybody puts their hazard lights on, and next thing you know, this hail for about 
[01:46:30]  a minute and a half starts coming down, like, for at least a minute and a half.  And next thing you know, my car, I swear to God, must have moved at least a foot.  No joke.  A foot.  A foot.  Dude, I mean, that's more than 10, 11 inches.  They call that the finger of God.  That's right.  Shuffling along.  Category five.  And God's showing how silly he is again.  Just blowing out a huge, huge pane of glass at a church up there.  Why wouldn't he leave the churches alone?  Exactly. 
[01:47:00]  I live in the Midwest, too, and I'm telling you, I've never been in storms like a storm  in New York like that.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Well, it sounds like we're lucky to have you.  Global warming.  Absolutely, it is.  Thank God you're okay, man.  All right.  Had things gone, definitely wouldn't have had this last couple of moments.  Let's go to Rich in Bohemia.  Rich.  Yeah, Al Gore predicted that tornado.  He did?  Yeah, in his movie.  He said there would be tornadoes in the east?  Yes, it's global warming.  All right.  Oh, wow.  He was just messing. 
[01:47:30]  Screw it.  Let's go to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  And it'll be blowing boring callers all over the place.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, Matt.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Actually, I was just going to say, I mean, ever since I started listening to you guys,  I noticed every time, like, I listen to the news or, you know, watch the news or whatever,  it's just, you always notice all the stupid little chit-chat, you know, they always say.  It's just so retarded.  I mean, the news improv is one of our favorite new bits.  We're getting a lot of people from all over the country to send their local news doing  that news improv thing.  Keep sending them in to danny at foundrymusic.com. 
[01:48:00]  We'll do another segment on that soon.  But send in, I want you to do this too.  Send in the station and their names, please.  We never have names of these people.  We should have names to call out because you might hear the same guy five times in a row.  Oh, you just get that uncomfortable feeling when you listen to this crap.  So it's danny at foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y.  And watch these phonies shuffling their papers.  Watch them.  They always, they always have this.  There's no reason for it. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  There's a teleprompter.  Michael from Tennessee, we sleep through F2 tornadoes here.  I laugh at your little storm.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I said don't embarrass us to the rest of the country because there's people  that have real tornado problems almost, what, every other week or something, it seems.  People in Hawthorne, ah, there were papers blowing in a circle in front of the delicatessen.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, they're getting like fives on the Fujita scale, the Fujita tornado scale.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, we got the Surrey update.  Thank you.  Oh, thank God.  We'll play that in a minute.  Where's Surrey?  But first, why not?  Let's do some news teasers.  What do you say?  I love the news teas.  We got a new batch of news teasers.  We can do a few here.  Since we're talking about the news, why not?  Show them in all their glory what they do best.  Try to scare the crap out of America.  That's what they do.  They get on.  Maybe you're watching a show.  Maybe you're watching House.  Maybe you're watching Desperate Housewives.  And all of a sudden, a news tease will come for what's coming up at 10 or 11. 
[01:49:30]  And it can't just be, hey, we're going to tell you the news.  Here's some of the headlines we're working on.  It's just, it's got to be, your shoes can kill you.  Can they?  What?  Your child could be playing with a toy right now that could kill it.  But we're not going to tell you until Monday.  But that's scary.  And then they tell you, and it's really nothing.  It's just to suck you in to watch.  Hate the news.  All right.  Here we go.  The first scary news teas.  Buckle in.  By the way, we also got to pay close attention to see if it qualifies for the News Tees Hall 
[01:50:00]  of Fame.  Okay.  Sure.  All right.  This was the latest entry in the News Tees Hall of Fame, by the way.  This one made it.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  Yeah.  That is a Hall of Famer right there, folks.  Hall of Fame.  It's got all the features.  It's horrifying because everyone's horrified of getting cancer.  Oh.  No, getting the hiccups.  Yes.  And it's something so common. 
[01:50:30]  I don't think there's a person walking the globe who hasn't at some point gotten the  hiccups for longer than you've wanted it.  Right.  So how are the hiccups and maybe having cancer tied together?  There's no answer to it.  So it's just meant to scare as many people as they possibly can.  To get the biggest audience to watch the rest of the news.  You're walking along.  Where's my wig?  Oh, my God.  Chemo.  Wig.  All right.  Here we go.  No eyebrows.  Here's the latest scary news tease that came in. 
[01:51:00]  Listen to this one.  And a urinal that could save lives.  NBC 10 explains what it's all about.  Tonight at 11.  Turn to NBC 10.  All right.  All right.  A what?  A urinal that could save lives.  What the hell?  Is that the new superhero from Marvel Comics?  I am urinal.  That's right.  He hands out cakes.  That's how please do we have an answer to this one? 
[01:51:30]  Where's Danny?  This is Danny's bit.  I like that.  Dan.  Nice pass the buck, Dan.  Nice pass the buck.  Where is that idiot?  Danny, do we know how the urinal is going to save lives?  Yeah, I believe this is a variation of the talking bar toilet.  Where it's talking bar toilet.  It's a variation of the talking bar toilet.  Oh, oh, that old thing.  The one that reminds you to like, you know, not drink and drive, give your keys to a buddy.  Oh.  Things like that. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, this one probably, does this one test blood alcohol level?  No, I don't believe so.  I don't think that would be interesting.  So you're doing what you do and it talks back to you saying you shouldn't, your eyes gives  you friendly reminders.  Ew.  You'll have AIDS.  Can you imagine me taking the lead?  Or the guy next to you is peaking.  Yeah, it gets you in trouble.  Yeah, that's what we really need.  That's a nice one.  Yeah.  I didn't sit now.  The urinal's talking.  Or it catches you and goes, eyes ahead, eyes straight ahead.  Or, you're European. 
[01:52:30]  Well, there you go.  So it talks.  Anyone know what it says?  Or?  I don't know.  Well, they love to, uh, they love-  Warning, warning, warning.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Warning, warning, warning.  That's not in the-  That's in the-  Oh, how can I say this?  That's not in the shape it should be, considering what you're doing.  No, I can't say it right.  All right, you try, though. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, that's-  You try to clean it.  That's not a bomb and a flub.  That's just what I-  Excuse me while I whip this out.  All right.  They should have the urinal just laugh at you if you're not packing.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Asian alert.  Asian alert.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  All right, let's move on to the next Scara News tease.  Of course, they love scaring us about our water.  Don't drink it.  Don't cook with it.  Don't even shower with it. 
[01:53:30]  A water warning why people in some towns are angry about how they found out.  What town?  Some towns.  Some towns.  You whore.  How about naming the town so people who are not in those towns can go have a beverage?  Oh, do I hate them?  It's all made to terrorize you and to make you watch their news.  Because it's not the news.  It is entertainment.  It is a TV show like any other sitcom, a drama, hospital cop show, and the news. 
[01:54:00]  It's all the same thing.  It's not informative.  It's there to scare, to titillate.  You ever see a great movie on network TV and what scum they are?  You ever see Network by William Holden and Kate Dunaway and Peter Finch won the Oscar report, Robert Duvall?  It's a genius prediction into reality TV and the way the news is.  It's such a great movie.  When you watch it nowadays, you're like, oh, what's the big deal? 
[01:54:30]  But a lot of this stuff that they talk about in this movie wasn't happening yet.  It was like, what was the year?  What year?  It was like 78?  I want to say 78 or 80, 81.  It was in that area.  I go back further.  It might even go back further?  I go to 75.  No, no, no.  Not 75.  Are you sure?  100%.  Punch it up, Iraq.  Punch it up.  Punch it up before you get a good chin kick.  Let's get a date on network, my friend.  79 or 83.  I'm saying 75.  I'll say 52.  Kev says 81.  75.  Definitely not the 80s.  I did say 78.  76. 
[01:55:00]  I'm closer.  Without going over.  Price is right rules, buster.  Yeah, but Bob Barker is an animal-neutering ass.  Oh, he really is.  All right, listen.  We know the pets.  We get it.  We get it.  We'll take a break.  Maybe we'll do more news teases when we get back.  I'm scared.  Maybe we won't.  How about that?  Maybe we won't.  Coming at you in Nashville, July 27th through 29th.  Zanies.  Jim Norton, everybody.  Hey, we could do news teases when we get back. 
[01:55:30]  We could do a Microsoft customer service call.  Actual message left.  Indian service rep is impossible to understand.  This could be good for a chuckle.  I've been.  No, not a chuckle.  I've been in that situation too many times.  And then we could save news teases for tomorrow.  And we got the latest on Mad Cow.  Stupid ass.  Stupid Mad Cow.  Language.  I've heard the audio.  He sounds nervous.  That's why we started this saying years ago. 
[01:56:00]  Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We at the Opie and Anthony, y'all, appreciate that not everyone has access to a professional recording studio.  So when listeners send us their own material, we know it might sound slightly less polished.  Opie and Anthony.  Hardcore radio.  Oh, it's a smoothie day here. 
[01:56:30]  I want a smoothie, but I want pineapple and strawberry.  I like blueberry.  I like soft fruit.  Are you in a beauty parlor two weeks ago?  What do you need, Dolphes?  Do you like looking at me?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Spread the virus.  I got my back wax jester.  What the hell is wrong with you?  If you think you have the chance to be a bargain bin broadcaster, send in your material.  And keep in mind the very likely possibility that you just might suck. 
[01:57:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Man, it goes by way too fast over here.  We're going to continue on XM Satellite Radio in about 15, 20 minutes.  Before that, we'll try to squeeze some more radio at you.  We got Otto and George in studio.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Otto?  What a wall of security you got downstairs.  That old guy? 
[01:57:30]  Can I see your idea?  I gave him a Burger King killpon.  He goes, okay, go ahead.  That ass down there.  Yeah.  You got Club Soda Ken here.  Personality of an olden gray.  Jesus.  Would you like a coffee?  Lurch.  I don't.  You're not going to get an argument from us.  No.  Hey, just before the break, we were doing news teases, and Anthony said, shoes. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring up an example of it, and off the top of my head, I tried to find something ridiculous.  Right, right, right.  So I just said, can your shoes kill you?  Just as a joke.  And then Danny comes in and goes, here's the news tease.  Are you kidding me?  About shoes.  Something about shoes.  Yeah.  The tallest man in the world died from ill-fitting shoes.  No way.  Yeah, giants, they can't get shoes that fit correctly.  They always die from some blood infection.  From shoes?  Yeah.  Blood infections. 
[01:58:30]  How do you know this?  How do you know this?  I don't know this.  You think you just take them off?  Yeah.  Don't be giant.  Little tidbit.  Don't be giant.  It's probably...  Shoes, all right.  So we got the news tease on shoes.  Can I curse yet?  Yeah, go ahead.  Can I curse yet?  No.  Yeah, go ahead.  Not CRL each other.  We're close.  We're close to the cursing portion of the program.  Yeah, you can curse in 15 minutes.  You'll do the walkover with us, right, Otto?  I'm dying to curse. 
[01:59:00]  MySpace, Otto and George, right?  Yeah.  Otto and George on MySpace.  Check out what's going on.  All right.  Here's the scary news tease about shoes.  Shoes.  Anthony was joking about this, but there really is a news tease about shoes.  Error.  And Eric.  Wow, man.  We just set that up for five minutes.  And we get an error message.  That's not E-Rock's fault.  It didn't say error.  It said E-Rock.  The machine is blaming you.  God, we don't have it. 
[01:59:30]  That's right, Dan.  Too busy on the phone with Paris Hilton there, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Is that what it was?  I had nothing to do with it.  He's probably calling the Hilton.  He's like, I had nothing to do with it.  He's calling the Hilton on 7th.  Could you get me in touch with Paris?  We took a picture yesterday.  I'm not even supposed to be doing this.  No, E-Rock's trying to do something else, and he's...  All right, they're going to get another copy.  Hopefully, we'll get it on before we get out of here.  All right, fine.  He's getting a mayonnaise error message.  Thank you, Mr. Boston.  You're right.  I will tell you this.  If you do the same thing 10 times in a row...  Oh, wow. 
[02:00:00]  Did it work?  I look like an ass.  Way to shut the box up.  I look like an ass.  Way to humiliate up.  You better break that now.  I look like an ass.  I was ready to smash him good, because he was doing the same thing 10 times in a row.  We all do that, by the way, when something's not going right.  You just try the same thing 10 times in a row.  You can't understand why you can't figure out the problem.  E-Rock's laughing.  Great.  I look like a jerk.  Here's the news tease about shoes.  They are great for slipping on and heading out the door, but there's a hidden danger in  those flip-flops.  A hidden danger in flip-flops. 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  Yeah, you're going to look like an idiot.  Maybe if they belong to Magic Johnson, and he just walked through glass.  What is the hidden danger?  Danny, anything?  Yeah, Danny.  Wait, let me...  Something over there.  Go ahead.  There's no arch support, so you may have to...  If you wear flip-flops too much, you may be visiting a podiatrist shortly after.  If you're able to wear flip-flops in your life to the point where your arches fall, you 
[02:01:00]  don't have a job.  You can't go to work in flip-flops.  So who are they targeting this at?  Someone's got to put shoes on eventually.  Do you know, I can't wear flip-flops.  They always fall off.  I have to curl my toes down and dig into them.  I always fall off.  I don't know how people wear flip-flops.  You will never see me wearing flip-flops.  You've got weird feet, though.  You've got, like, blocked feet.  I have short, fat feet.  Yeah, something's going on in your feet.  Try walking forward.  Is that...  That's how the flip-flop works.  That's how the flip-flop works. 
[02:01:30]  I was trying to figure, how do you get that little, like, what's that little thing called?  The separator?  It always hits my heel.  And how uncomfortable?  Let me just shove this thing between your big toe and the other toe.  Just stick it in there.  Red and raw.  You squirt some lemon juice in there.  Take a sniff.  Hey, Scarecrow from Jersey.  Lemon juice.  Maybe giants die because their hearts can't handle pumping blood so far for more than a few decades.  You dope.  No, but he's saying that...  Wow, this guy's calling Otto and George a dope. 
[02:02:00]  That's true.  Giants have a normal-sized heart and has to pump all the blood to those extremities.  But that guy's a jerk anyway.  How do you do it, Kenny?  How does your heart pump to those feet?  Those big, those big flat foot cop feet?  I am big and stupid, and I have a very small head because there's very little brains in them.  Oh, God.  Oh, thank you for that.  Thanks for adding that.  You should be sneezing in someone's face in Jurassic Park. 
[02:02:30]  Dolt.  Where are you going to be, Jimmy?  Oh, Nashville, the 27th to the 29th.  But I knew what it was!  No, he's dead!  Oh, wow, that's good.  No, my health doesn't allow it.  Try the wine!  Greatest character ever.  Barking out pleasantries.  What about when the guys carry him down the stairs in a wheelchair? 
[02:03:00]  Julian, good evening.  Badly timed.  Good evening.  Julian!  I like when he's eating.  Food, alright?  I gotta...  That's the funniest movie ever.  Rent that movie?  I haven't seen it in years.  Really, it's great.  Please get, you're right, good evening.  It is the greatest to all ever caught up in heaven.  Fuck, Greg Orange.  Let's do one more news tease, and then we'll move on to the Tom Cruise baby update.  No, my health doesn't allow it. 
[02:03:30]  One more scary news tease before we move on.  Sex offenders, all the rage.  Very scary.  Your children.  All the rage.  Your children.  And of course, we'll never get tired of these two that made the scary news tease Hall of Fame.  Yep.  Both about sex offenders.  Listen to this, Otto.  Okay.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  How do they get away with lying to the people like that? 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  Like that's ever, ever going to happen.  And then this one made the Hall of Fame as well.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Shut down religion.  There it goes.  Try to get into my church.  Big locks on the door.  Wow.  Shut it right down.  Maybe that's why Jesus died from bad flip-flops.  He should have prepared more for this.  Bad flip-flops. 
[02:04:30]  All right, here we go.  So here's the latest scary news tease about sex offenders.  Geraldo at large, New York.  Sex offenders moving in.  We uncover a plan that could plant predators in your backyard.  Tonight at 11 on Fox 5.  In your backyard?  That's right.  What are they, setting up a little tents?  A shanty?  Yeah, a little shanty town of pedophiles in your backyard.  Come on.  They just disgust me.  Listen to this drivel. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, they're in tree forts.  I don't want that pedophile in my yard.  Well, we're building a tree fort, and he has to live there.  You just open up your kitchen window and look out back.  He's still there.  He's built a swing set, and he's just pushing it, waiting for your kid to come out.  He's dressed like De Niro in This Boy's Life, like a giant boy scout.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  You shut your goddamn pie hole and get Timmy out here.  I can't build enough playground stuff.  Monkey bars. 
[02:05:30]  And you have to feed him.  Yeah.  He's in your backyard.  You got to offer some food.  Your responsibility.  Stop.  How great is that?  In your backyard.  Not in your neighborhood.  Yeah, it was right in your backyard.  Now it's in your backyard.  They uncovered something, because it was a big secret.  Like, the government knew that they were going to put pedophiles in our backyard.  They're going to be secret.  Eight-year-olds, dude.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  Wow. 
[02:06:00]  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  Wow.  Whore.  People can call me anything they want, as long as they don't call me late for supper.  Wow, what an ass he was in that movie.  Oh, complete.  Yeah, God.  When he's shoving that mustard thing on DiCaprio's cheek.  It's like, great.  Big round mustard blocks there.  Should have left that on for the rest of his career.  French's mustard.  Not even the good brown stuff. 
[02:06:30]  That's some cheap mustard on his cheek.  French's mustard is good on a hot dog, but any other sandwich, you need the brown stuff.  I don't even like it on a hot dog anymore.  Nah, you know, I have to go with the brown.  I would have to agree to disagree.  I don't know.  The yellow mustard's pretty.  Yellow mustard also?  Pretzels.  Yeah.  On the big, soft pretzel.  No!  Yellow mustard's fine on a pretzel.  Let's give it to the audience.  What do you think, people?  Yellow mustard on the pretzel.  Good evening.  I like a mustard with, like, some kind of horseradish mix. 
[02:07:00]  No, yes.  Yes.  Glad to see you appreciate good mustard.  Peter from Utah, the boy's life, this boy's life, best movie ever, and Hoo-Hoo Higgy from  the Jersey Shore said they'd be planting pedophiles.  They'll never bloom before the fall comes.  The boy fights for the pink team.  All right.  How about a Tom Cruise baby update?  The Surrey watch.  Where's little Surrey?  It's up to...  Oh, here it is.  Oh, no.  That's Sam.  86 days without a glimpse of Tom Cruise's baby. 
[02:07:30]  What did he hand out?  Cigars and scotch, but it was really oddly timed.  You got really bad timing.  Got the picture of E-Rock that he took.  Oh, Sam just pointed and blamed.  Who'd you blame?  That's a good shot.  Who are you blaming?  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Why are you blaming E-Rock?  We'd fire you, Sam, but you don't make money with us.  Exactly.  You're black and you have apple cheeks.  I don't know how that works.  E-Rock took an awful picture with Paris Hilton last night where he went in and  really too close to her head to make it look like he was a boyfriend and she was all  uncomfortable, and someone photoshopped a picture of Jim Norton in there next to him, 
[02:08:00]  so now he's snuggled up to Jim Norton.  I've never seen you in a suit.  That was probably at the...  Who's that?  Did I look at the Spike Lee picture?  Why am I such a bug-eyed?  What's with your eyes all open up?  I don't know.  I get burn victimized.  Leave Harvey Oswald before the shot from Ruby.  Don't know?  Okay.  Bam!  Bam!  He was surprised.  That's what I was getting at.  He was very surprised.  Look, here's the deal.  The pictures are up on opianthony.com. 
[02:08:30]  The photoshops have begun, so check out the fan sites for the photoshops.  We got the Tom Cruise Suri Watch, day 86 without seeing the kid.  Here's the latest.  In today's Suri Watch, just when you thought you'd heard it all, entertainment website  rake.com announced the launch of the sure-to-be-controversial Suri Quest, which offers $100,000  to the first person to upload an original video of the child with either Tom or Katie.  I thought to kill. 
[02:09:00]  Break.com CEO Keith Richman was quick to point out that the company would not condone any  illegal or dangerous acts in the obtaining of said video.  But surely $100,000 won't drive anyone to do anything stupid.  Of course not.  Break.com, brilliant.  $100,000.  Brilliant.  That's like a bounty.  You're going to R. Kelly Suri.  Break.com, brilliant.  $100,000.  $100,000. 
[02:09:30]  Why didn't we come up with that?  Why?  You need a picture.  You don't have $100,000.  That's a lot of cash.  Tom Chiasana would give that.  That's true.  $100,000.  Carries it in his pockets like so many nickels and dimes.  Must let us wet our beaks.  All right.  Draw from the well.  The man-cow thing is going to have to wait until we get over to XM.  Homework assignment.  That's right.  No.  Not for us.  Oh, goody.  For the listeners.  What would you do for $1,000?  The ideas are pouring in. 
[02:10:00]  They all stink.  We got $5,000 to give away.  $1,000 a day all next week.  We got one good idea, though.  Is the guy going to come in Monday?  Thumbs up or down?  Mouse glue trap.  Back guy.  We got to have a backup, though.  We got a guy named Larry that might be the backup.  We got two guys, I think, coming in Monday to do back wax with mousetrap glue.  So their backs are hairy.  You take the mousetrap glue thing and slap it on the back and then rip it up. 
[02:10:30]  Who's going to rip it off?  We got to get a hot chick involved.  Find us a hot chick for Monday's show.  Travis.  Travis.  So here's your homework assignment.  What would you do for $1,000?  We'll take your ideas tomorrow.  A lot of ideas coming in.  They all stink.  Chili pepper eating contest.  Some girl in Pittsburgh wants to jello wrestle with Jimmy.  You both have to wear a bikini.  Yeah, does she?  Sit in studio and take abuse for a day.  Boring.  Ew. 
[02:11:00]  A guy wants to throw himself through a table on fire with nails and tacks.  Yeah.  Boring.  That'll happen.  You got to do a little better than that gang.  I want to sit in studio and be insulted all day.  Sounds great.  Yeah.  We'll take your ideas tomorrow.  Otto and George, MySpace.com.  Talk a little do.  And he's going to continue with us on XM Satellite Radio in just a few minutes.  Thanks for checking us out today, guys.  Have a great day.  Bye.  Amara. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hi, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt.  Hey, folks, my name is Henry Rollins.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong, and you're listening to Pot Talk.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I love this.  Please refrain from the word s***.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now. 
[02:12:00]  And so I'm talking to him, and I'm like, dude, if you pull your cock out, I'll suck it.  But if you don't, what am I going to do?  Ah, that's what you always say.  Right.  Whenever you see a cock, you've got to just start to...  All right.  All right.  Let's get the headphones and get Otto around.  That old gag.  Yeah, I know.  It's awful.  Not only is it an old, awful gag, but I'm not good at selling it.  No.  Why is the guy who's here every day, the fucking big-headed guy, he looks like a tall version 
[02:12:30]  of the security guard.  Why is he sweating like that?  Oh, my God.  He just carried a bus.  What the fuck?  He carried a bus.  He really is a sweaty mess.  Yes.  Hey.  Well, we're outside the building.  Where's Otto and George?  Right here.  Oh, okay.  They're setting him up with a microphone.  Did he demand two microphones?  One for the fucking puppet.  More people coming down the sidewalk.  Yeah, it's getting crazy.  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:13:00]  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  And anyone who's on the walk today, where's Eric?  Did he leave?  Hey, how you doing?  I want Eric to have to do the walkover in that child shirt that he's wearing today, and  we should have listeners just punch him in the stomach.  Ooh, until he cries.  Are we here?  Yeah.  Hey, our Asian friends are here again, too.  Yeah.  Why are they here every day?  They just hang out at the corner every time.  No, no, no.  They're waiting for something.  The Chinese are coming, and they're spies.  Perhaps it's...  Maybe they work over here?  Is this the... 
[02:13:30]  No boo, no boo.  Kenny's trying to figure out what they're doing.  What do you do here?  They hang out every morning, and they read, like, Chinese newspapers.  Yeah.  Kenny.  Wow.  Hold on.  Here we go.  They don't speak English, but I'm speculating they're in line for SARS masks.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  How many in your party?  Otto and George, everyone, for the walkover today.  Yeah, let's...  If somebody can, laugh a minute.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Club soda, Ken.  All right, here we go.  Let's go.  Let's walk.  Oh, look at the couple.  They're sharing headphones.  Oh, that's adorable.  All right.  One-oh.  Well.  Uh-huh.  You've got to be in here.  If it's raining, you want to jump in.  Oh, that's okay.  I don't see that it's raining that badly.  A little sprinkle here in New York this morning.  Who gives a flying fuck?  We have to get...  Good evening.  We have to get Otto the headset that, like, Madonna wears. 
[02:14:30]  He's trying to hold the puppet.  He's trying to hold this.  What's next?  Good evening.  He's in the chair.  Carrying him like that old gimp.  Sorry to come at this ungodly.  Oh, hello, Frank.  Cut the shit, sonny.  Eddie, punch that Chinese girl in the stomach.  I don't do what I tell him.  Are you in need of these fucking things?  Well, you have to hear. 
[02:15:00]  No, you don't.  There you are.  I'm the disaster I am.  Look at this one faggot with an umbrella.  It's barely, barely even a droplet of water coming down.  Oh, it's pouring.  He's over it next time.  We're going to see him in a minute.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  Is it raining?  So which homeless guy are we going to take a cheap shot at this time?  Not give him any money.  Is Mac over there?  Where's the umbrellas? 
[02:15:30]  Umbrellas?  What's with the fucking umbrellas?  It's raining.  It's not raining.  It is.  There is barely anything coming down.  It is.  It's urine.  It's New York.  There's no rain.  Oh, doesn't this movie look great?  From the guys who brought you white chicks.  The Wayans brothers and the little...  Awful.  Oh.  Awful.  By the way, they blew us off.  They were supposed to be on our show.  Were they?  Good.  We said yes.  Roland gives us a whole list of celebrities every day that are potential guests for the show. 
[02:16:00]  We say yes to 90% of them, and we get maybe 5% of the ones we say yes to.  That's great.  Wait.  When were they supposed to be on?  I don't know.  They were doing press, I think, yesterday.  I saw them on TRL.  They were terrific.  It's one sight gag.  That's the whole movie.  One of the Wayans brothers plays a fucking milk dud with arms.  They're very good.  They're very talented.  I'm just saying.  I see how a white girl can fall in. 
[02:16:30]  They do these impersonations.  Hello, miss.  Hi, lady.  Miss.  A little baby in a carriage.  An ugly baby.  Look at that.  A lovely baby.  Yes.  A very ugly baby.  You said lovely.  Extremely ugly baby.  Oh, my God.  Drop something.  People don't like hearing their babies are ugly.  Wow.  Ooh, these are two serious guys.  Where? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, there's a homeless guy in here today.  There is nothing going on in this fucking walk.  Nothing.  This walk stinks today.  Some days it just, there's no people.  Oh, my God.  She's coughing.  No germs.  Take some X-lax.  You'll be too scared to cough.  Cunt.  All right, there you go.  Cunt.  That made the walk over worthwhile right there.  This guy.  Oh, flip-flops.  The danger of flip-flops.  The beach is 40 miles that way, fella. 
[02:17:30]  Sir.  Sir.  Sir.  Jerk.  All right.  This looks like it might be good.  What is this monstrosity?  Super X-Girlfriend.  Bullshit.  Oh, Jesus.  Excuse me, um, lady from Total Recall?  Two weeks.  Two.  Look, he's covering his mouth.  He knows the stars.  Yeah.  Wow, this is the Opie and Anthony truck.  Yep.  Yeah, look at that.  Isn't that something?  And the Norton truck.  And Jimmy Norton's on it.  Oh, they put my face on the side of a van. 
[02:18:00]  Of course they did.  Oh!  And look, Danny's face is on that window.  Oh, no.  There you go, buddy.  In the truck.  What an ugly bag of shit I am.  No, you're adorable.  Oh, this is the MyRadioStore.com van.  Yes.  Oh, of course Ziggy did it right.  Because it's not the X-Men van.  Very good.  There's the Zigster.  Ziggy's here.  Ziggy.  Nah, Ziggy.  Nah.  Wow.  Yeah, I just want to apologize for the walk.  I know. 
[02:18:30]  It really wasn't anything.  It's fucking pouring out here.  There you go.  Otto had a couple good lines.  Yes, that's true.  I thought of some funny stuff.  Just saving it.  All right, we're just waiting for something to happen.  Nothing's happening.  Nothing's happening.  No one's walking around really that much.  I have to go on the walk in case somebody attacks my boss.  I'm there.  I will throw down.  That's right.  I'm prepared.  Crush, kill, destroy.  You want a coffee? 
[02:19:00]  Smoothie.  Right.  Smoothie time.  Oh, God.  Yes, it is smoothie time.  Yeah.  I'll have one, Kenny, by the way, today.  Yes.  Otto, George, anything?  No, I don't know what that is.  Oh, it's a great concoction of banana, strawberry,  and come.  Oh, really?  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  What are you doing in New York today?  I just came from the dentist.  Ah.  It was fun.  All right.  And let him roll.  Okay.  It was a pleasant experience. 
[02:19:30]  Wait, no, what happened?  What did you have to go to the dentist for?  Oh, just a little thing, but I'm, it's fine.  What little thing?  Let us know now.  We want to know details.  A little thing.  Have you looked in the mirror lately?  You don't want to know.  Brush your teeth to my cock.  It had to be some type of gum infection.  Yes.  Yeah, because I'm seeing that you haven't taken care of your teeth like you're supposed to.  What?  Well, I didn't know.  Brush your teeth to my cock.  I wasn't flossing enough.  I have to pay the price.  Goggling with anthrax, dirty whore.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at this. 
[02:20:00]  What is this person's name?  This is George.  This is Otto and his wooden buddy, George.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  Very handsome eyebrows.  She thinks I'm real.  You're a frightening old whore.  I think you are real.  You're very cute.  I think he's very cute.  Ah, thank you.  Anyway.  Club soda can get ready.  Here's my advice.  Security.  Floss.  Floss.  Floss.  Floss.  Is that it?  I didn't do it right.  You didn't, did you?  No, no, no, no.  And I'm paying the price, but I'm better now, and he gave me a clean bill about it.  Can I pour raw sewage in your vagina with a funnel? 
[02:20:30]  You know, for a goof.  A thousand dollars, whore.  Okay.  Anyway, very nice to see you.  Wow.  All right, goodbye.  Wait, miss.  Oh, my God.  Her teeth were off.  Her teeth and her fucking bunions.  Jesus.  Floss.  That's beyond flossing.  You need rope to floss at this point.  Those have to be knocked out with a fucking ball-peen hammer.  Oh, there's a man photographing us from a truck, holding up traffic.  He's holding up traffic on 57.  Give us one of these, bro. 
[02:21:00]  There he is.  Nice.  Everyone starts beeping.  That's what this city needs.  More fucking noise.  And non-flossing whores.  Who's that lady with the awful bouffant hair?  Oh, that's Ben.  Oh.  Fucking rotten bob cut.  All right, we got something out of the walk.  Ben has a smart hairdo.  Smart.  Let's go upstairs and continue.  All right.  Yes, let us roam.  Otto and George made the walk worthwhile today.  Certainly did.  Pardon me.  Very good.  Otto and George on MySpace.com.  We'll continue in just a bit. 
[02:21:30]  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Eh.  Complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Desincration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  Hugh Rocking said.  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie! 
[02:22:00]  Uh-oh.  We're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing.  And then when they go too far, they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat  is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  It's a new cloud to the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up! 
[02:23:00]  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  You don't need anything to do.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You don't need anything to do. 
[02:23:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:00]  We bailed us out of that walk.  That walk stunk.  Rainy.  Everyone's miserable.  That woman's gums were so fucking bad.  Oh.  And then she's advocating flossing.  It's like the fucking commercials they used to play with the guy with the cancer. 
[02:24:30]  Saying don't smoke, no shit, asshole.  Look at you.  Jimmy Norton's here.  He certainly is.  Joining us.  What are you doing, making time with that girl on the elevator?  No, no, no.  I actually have a...  A beef?  I got no beef.  What's your beef?  They're an entertainment lawyer on the 11th floor of this building, and I asked about  the domain name, and she said they might be able to do something, so I told them to call  them. 
[02:25:00]  Because someone's squatting on Jimmy.  The cyber squatter.  I think they're in Vegas, I found out.  I will find out who they are, because they're hidden behind some fucking privacy, the moniker  privacy service.  Because we want to hold your name, but we're behind a privacy service.  So now you can't find out who it is?  Yeah, but somebody will find out for me.  And one guy was going to do it, his law firm was going to help me, because that's what they  do.  And then he's like, you know, what was the charge of this?  At first they thought they could do it for like, you know, it doesn't have to be for free, 
[02:25:30]  but then they wanted like a retainer.  Well, Jimmy, remember, don't take matter into your own hands.  Take him to court.  I know, Doug Llewellyn, you're right.  Rusty Burrell and I were talking.  And if I would have said matters instead of matter.  No, you were saying matter.  Don't take matter into, don't hold matter.  Ever.  Ever.  Just leave it alone.  Because of gravity and string theory, says Dr. Cuckoo.  He hates it.  All right, where's Club Soda fucking?  I think Club Soda, Kenny, is getting everybody their various beverages that are very important. 
[02:26:00]  Uh-oh, I told him I wanted a smoothie.  I hope he didn't get going.  Oh, there he is.  Ken always comes in.  Ken's very efficient.  You don't get the same thing every day, though?  No.  Somebody has to go for me.  Here's what I want.  You have too much variation in your life.  Hold on.  Let me just move my fucking beautiful cock.  I would like...  Give your hand.  I want egg whites.  You're making them in your pants right now.  Oh, no, I'm not.  I want egg white from the Brooklyn Diner. 
[02:26:30]  And I would like an orange.  And I would like a pack of extra pink.  What the hell is that?  Boogum.  Extra pink.  Oh, extra gum.  Pink extra boogum.  Yeah.  Good.  Where is it?  Right there, sweetie pie.  Right around this corner from Club Soda, Kenneth.  Let me give you some money, Ken.  What do you want?  Here's a hundred.  Does George want anything?  Otto, you like something? 
[02:27:00]  A bottle of scotch and a chocolate donut.  No, I'm good.  The coffee's good.  All right.  I might go to Carmine's later.  What's Carmine's?  Restaurant in Times Square area.  Yeah.  Really good.  Let's go right to the phones.  Weenie with white clam sauce.  The best.  We talking...  Marron.  You can eat it with a fuck.  Did you try the gabadour?  Are you really going there later?  Yeah, possibly.  What time?  As soon as I'm done with you three knuckleheads.  What do they have?  Are you having, like, fucking headphones? 
[02:27:30]  A lunch?  Are you having a lunch?  Yeah.  I like lunch.  Let's go to Sean.  Food.  Let's go to Sean in Minnesota and get things going here.  I want this spaghetti you can fall face first into.  Yeah.  Sean, what's up?  Evening.  Hey, I want to give Eddie, uh, her, Anthony, some credit on, uh, his comment on what's all  in a smoothie.  I don't think anybody heard it.  Wait, what happened there?  Well, when Anthony, well, somebody asked what was all in a smoothie, Anthony said, strawberries,  bananas, and cum.  I didn't hear it.  Oh.  Well, you missed it.  You ever embarrass me again, you Jew motherfucker? 
[02:28:00]  You're dead.  It's all in the delivery.  Yeah, ass.  There you go.  All right, we got the, uh, you want to go right into the man cow thing?  Uh, sure.  This asshole man cow.  Yes, I agree.  Got, uh, fired.  Fired.  We hear nothing but bad things from our, uh, comedian friends.  From everybody that talks about this guy, there's nothing but bad things.  Yeah.  His general, general manager that just, uh, gave him the boot.  It wasn't even one of those things. 
[02:28:30]  Usually in radio, when someone gets fired, it's one of those, they try to make it seem  amicable.  Like, well, there was a parting of the ways, well, you know, the ideology of us, our show,  and the management was different.  And this guy just got on and goes, this guy just sucks now, and we don't need him, and  fuck him.  Yeah.  He sucks, the whole town's sick of him, and he's shit-canned.  And then yesterday, um, I was listening to, uh, Danny Bonaduce, he was on, uh, uh, JV and  Elvis, and, uh, Danny Bonaduce talked about this time that he beat the shit out of man cow 
[02:29:00]  in a parking garage.  Really?  And it's hysterical.  He said, uh, man cow was giving him some shit, and he went down into this parking garage,  uh, and man cow was there with this chick.  And the chick was, was, uh, uh, standing in front of man cow, like man cow held the girl  in front of him while he talked to Danny Bonaduce.  And Danny's like, you talk about my kids and stuff, I'm, I'm going to beat the shit  out of you.  Wow.  And, and then he goes, uh, he, he called man cow's girl at the time. 
[02:29:30]  This is what, uh, uh, he alleged yesterday, said he called her a cunt just to get man cow  pissed.  And man cow did anything.  And Danny said, don't you have any honor?  And, and man cow said, honor, what, what year is, is, do you think it is like honor has  some kind of expiration date?  And then he just got pissed.  And, and, uh, even though bank, I was holding the girl in front of him, he goes, man cow's  head was about a foot over the girl's head.  So he just wound up and punched him square in the face and laid him out. 
[02:30:00]  And then a couple of his buddies drew a chalk mark around him when he was knocked out just  so they could look at it and laugh later.  Isn't man, isn't Bonaduce your karate guy?  Bonaduce will fucking kill you.  Really?  He's got some martial arts experience.  The guy's an animal, yeah.  You don't want to.  He's got martial arts experience.  He's an animal and he just, he's fucking psychopath.  And he doesn't care.  He's got the steroid, uh, rage.  Roid rage.  Wow.  And he just does, he's one of those guys that just doesn't fucking care.  Yeah.  Like he'll, he'll fuck you up.  So this is what he said?  You do not get on his bad side. 
[02:30:30]  This is what he said on the radio yesterday?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, it was really, uh.  When did this happen?  Really good.  Uh, I guess it had to be over a year or so ago because he's since been on Mancow's show  to plug his show.  Like somebody said, Bonaduce was like, hey, they told me to go on his show and plug my show.  He goes, I didn't want to do it.  But then, uh, uh, they said, yeah, you know, you might as well do it.  Get the word out in Chicago.  So he goes, he went on expecting a fight and Mancow acted like it never happened.  Said something like, yeah, we had an argument once in a parking lot.  Like, oh, put it out of his head, lied about it. 
[02:31:00]  Like he does everything else.  Would a Bonaduce lie or no?  Why would Mancow allow him back on the show?  Yeah, that sounds a little weird.  That sounds fishy.  Uh, it does.  You know something?  As far as Mancow goes, though, it doesn't sound fishy to me.  Mancow would probably do something like that to like, to diffuse the whole thing.  Yeah, but do it.  Because it was a story that's been going around.  He's just an empty blowhard.  He has nothing to say, and he thinks he's doing a comedy show, and it's just awful.  Yeah, that's what I hear from people that have been guests on his show.  It's like, it's 18 people running around, and him, like, going from one person, and then, 
[02:31:30]  all right, now be funny.  Go ahead, do something funny.  Oh, you don't have anything?  Well, go fuck yourself.  Okay, now we're going to go to this guy.  Oh, let's go to the phones.  Let's go.  And he turns people's mics off and stuff like that?  Yeah.  He steps on your lines, you know?  He asks.  What's that there, George?  What does he do?  Yeah.  All right, where'd you get that puppet?  Yeah, bitter and fucking...  So he's trying to change his act.  He's got some Christian values now.  Christian values and children.  He doesn't want to be known as a shock jock anymore.  That's fun on the radio.  Christian values and talking about your children. 
[02:32:00]  Ooh, good fucking radio there.  God loves cock jokes.  Come on.  Of course he does.  He doesn't fucking let everybody down.  His ratings were nothing like they used to be, and so they decided to move on.  They didn't want to pay him all that money for ratings that weren't as good as it used  to be.  And he's claiming he was number one in all this.  We went over the ratings yesterday.  Lies.  He was even close to being number one.  Big douche.  So, lies.  Here's Man Cow, I think, last night.  Thank you to Kevin in Chicago for sending this in. 
[02:32:30]  Tonight, Man Cow unplugged on getting unplugged from Chicago Morning Radio.  Q101 FM dumped the popular, sometimes raunchy jock.  As the station goes in a different direction, Man Cow tells me he plans to go nowhere.  Stupid name.  What the heck happened?  What happened?  I have no idea.  Do you feel like you failed?  No!  Okay.  Are you kidding?  Oh, boy.  Right there.  Right there.  That's a guy. 
[02:33:00]  Do you feel like you failed?  No!  Yeah, definitely.  Are you kidding?  He's yelling too much.  Booming radio voice.  Yeah, no!  Which means, yes!  Yes!  I don't know what the hell happened!  If you're going, no!  That absolutely means yes.  He should be punched every ten minutes in an underground garage.  Name another morning show in Chicago.  I'll tell you if I had a good year or two.  We've been number one for 12 years.  What's that car hit him?  Me, me, me.  We're number one with... 
[02:33:30]  If you want to break it down, we're number one with adult men in Chicago.  Okay?  Yeah.  You're not happy.  No, you know, they've...  I'm hearing a lot of things.  I'm learning a lot of things in the newspaper.  They're saying some very hurtful things to my family.  What?  They're saying some very hurtful things to my family.  Very hurtful.  I was very injured.  I made these guys tens of millions of dollars.  He hurt me with his words in the newspapers.  And my shoes fell off.  And I lost my job.  What an asshole.  The upper management, they talked it over and they said, 
[02:34:00]  we have some people in the newspapers on the payroll, don't we?  Maybe we could plan some stories.  He's a jock who got lost his ratings.  I'm saying some very hurtful things to my family.  They promised, jock.  They said some rough things.  I made these guys tens of millions of dollars for eight years.  I've been here for 12 years.  And a pat on the back would have been nice and thank you.  That would have been nice.  Yeah.  Your big competitors, are they laughing today?  Really?  No. 
[02:34:30]  Everyone's laughing at you.  My competitors don't think anything for granted when it comes to me.  Yes, they do.  No.  I'm the stuff of their nightmares.  I'll tell you.  No, you're not.  In a year, six months to a year, Chicago, radio-wise,  is going to be a much, much different place.  Yeah, because you're not there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to spearhead it.  Do you know where you're going to be next?  Without telling me, do you know where you're going to be?  I have a pretty good idea where I'm going to be.  For the rest of this week, you'll hear pre-recorded Best of Man, Kyle. 
[02:35:00]  Though his nationally syndicated show continues,  he won't be heard live in Chicago until at least, in his words, September.  You know where you're going to be?  Yeah, yeah, home.  Take care of my kids and preaching Christian values.  His hometown station kicked him off the air.  I'll be at the king with the other joint.  The only other guy in town there is this guy Steve Dahl.  You've ever heard of him?  He's been on forever.  Are you guys heard in Chicago as well?  Not yet.  Well, not yet.  Not yet.  On XM. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, on XM.  On XM, of course.  Yeah, right now.  It seems like we've got a pretty good following in Chicago as far as XMers go.  Right.  They're working on it.  He's over.  Oh, it just makes us very happy.  Not a nice man.  He's a douchebag.  Out with a fizzle, you fucker.  We hit the wall in a gasoline tanker when we fucked up.  I mean, everyone knows.  We fucked up and got fired on the top of our game.  Right.  That's the way you want to go out.  Not like all of a sudden he's off the air just to fizzle because your rating stunk and  your boss thinks you suck and you get fired. 
[02:36:00]  That ain't good.  That ain't good.  Did you guys think that there would be any trouble with that stunt at the St. Patrick's?  Really?  Yeah.  You thought it was that and out of line?  We kind of thought, but then we kind of hoped that it wouldn't.  And then as time went by, after a couple of days went by, we're like, oh, we're so fucked.  That's it.  That was a bad move.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought we would survive.  Yeah.  I knew we were fired.  I kind of thought we would survive.  I thought it would be really ugly, but I thought we'd get through it.  You should have gotten through it, too.  Yeah.  We're going to... 
[02:36:30]  We'll be back on the radio in no time two years later.  Oops.  Oops.  Yeah.  I was big.  Johnny Rocco.  Yeah.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Smash, eh?  Perfect feet of Lori.  Here's the deal.  He will be back on in Chicago.  There's got to be a station that's desperate enough to have him.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Will he do huge for that station?  No.  No way.  Good evening.  No way.  Hello, Frank.  All right. 
[02:37:00]  Sorry to come with this on the ground.  Who was that couple?  It was very badly raped, you see?  They were a couple probably in the government.  I'm guessing they were higher up in his form of government.  They were probably very against the establishment.  Yeah.  I never read the book or anything.  I heard you're in a bit of trouble.  No.  Helping like.  Where do you suppose it is he goes in the evenings?  It's funny.  Like, ever since I've known Norton, since he was like 12, it's like, that's all we ever  do is talk about clockwork and orange.  Now it's like on national radio.  It's like nothing's changed. 
[02:37:30]  No.  He's eating better and he's up.  You know, it's great.  Raging bull.  Yeah.  Same shit.  One of the first things Otto said to me when I met him is he put his arm around me and  he goes, that's the best fucking fighter around.  And I said, all the Moulinians are scared to fight him.  And he goes, you got that quote.  That's all I do.  Really?  Yeah.  It was at some shit gig.  Yeah.  Then we made out.  A couple of men who showed we weren't afraid.  You suck his cock?  Suck his fucking cock.  It's bigger than yours.  I suck his cock and everybody on the whole fucking block. 
[02:38:00]  Just a fat, selfish puppet.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue in just a bit.  MySpace, Otto and George.  Check them out.  Yes.  All right.  It's hot in here.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right.  Okay.  Terrific.  I'm going to put your mouth for a balls on.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool. 
[02:38:30]  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment, mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Hit her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until  they were 12.  Yes.  Precisely.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats, because here comes a home run.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Me and Anthony.  Give it to me.  We are all our talks, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Never getting up.  Never getting up.  We are all our talks, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff.  We are checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Otto and George in studio today.  Yeah.  Still lots to do, by the way.  We got Joan Rivers drunk on a stage in Australia.  Sound of gunfire breaks up Little League game. 
[02:39:30]  Homeland Security's target list includes petting zoos and popcorn stores.  Petting zoos?  That'd be an interest, right?  That'd be a fucking disgusting place.  Wow.  What's going on a petting zoo?  I wouldn't mind doing it.  Petting zoo?  I wouldn't mind doing it.  I want to go there and do this to a lamb.  Shook, shook, shook.  Under his chin.  Under his little chin.  Shook, shook, shook.  I want to crook my finger and go shook, shook, shook, shook.  Crying children wanting pieces of fucking corn and birdseed out of those gumball machines 
[02:40:00]  to feed them.  What's wrong with that?  It's fine.  I want to shut up.  My old place stinks.  Not all the kids cry at petting zoos.  Yes, they do.  Kids cry everywhere.  That's all they fucking do.  Who would want one?  God.  And then you give them the fucking shit to feed the pig or the goat, and they're fine  for that like five seconds.  And then they can run out.  No, that's all.  More!  More!  Yeah.  There's no stopping them. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, absolutely right.  We're looking at a future old...  Ungrateful little fuck.  Old lonely neighbor.  I'll be lonely old guy.  I don't care.  I'm not going to ruin my fucking years where I could have fun chasing little shit fucking  things around.  And you teach the little kid how to feed a horse.  You actually tape the oats into the little lad's fingers.  Right.  And then you tell him to just stick his hand in the horse's mouth, and he'll eat right  out of it.  Take a carrot, and wrap your fist around it, and hold it in front of the horse's face.  Yes.  That's how you do it.  Does any kid by like one year old not know how to feed a horse? 
[02:41:00]  Flat!  Palm!  Flat!  And you're flattened out to the point where your fingers are like touching the top of  your hand.  Yeah.  You're so afraid of that fucking big horse tooth.  I think we just talked to her on the street.  She said the floss.  And the food's all falling out because your hand is bent back.  Completely flat.  There's nothing you can hold like that.  And the horse is like, all right, shit dick.  I see your fingers.  Just let me eat the oats.  Give me a sugar cube.  Jimmy, would you be a father someday?  Break up.  We know Anthony's stance.  I'm out.  What? 
[02:41:30]  Would you be a father someday?  No.  We and Jimmy will adopt.  Yes.  We'll adopt a 10-year-old, be nice to her for eight years, then fuck her.  Wow.  That's a strategy.  Way to go, Woody Allen.  Hey, Jim, on Lucky Louie, are they going to let you keep the brown sweater you're wearing  in every fucking scene or what?  I mean, that's in every scene.  I know.  Except for one.  That stupid brown sweater sitting next to Louie.  It's like a lump of shit on a carrot cake.  Fucking wardrobe of Charlie Brown.  By the way, Otto wants to play the O&A Traveling Virus. 
[02:42:00]  Otto and George.  I think Otto absolutely should.  I don't know why that wasn't handled.  I'm seeking work.  That should have been handled earlier.  Is Pete listening?  Is there room?  We'd love to add Otto.  I mean, come on.  We would love to add Otto.  He's going to fucking tank.  We'd love to add Otto and George.  I think we certainly should.  The O&A Traveling Virus.  Circus ape.  I could do it.  All the lineups are on opianthony.com.  Voss must have had a horse feeding accident with those stubbed fingers of his.  Or he actually bit someone's fingers when they were feeding him. 
[02:42:30]  Those fucking dumb fence post teeth.  He had a sugar cube in his hands and bit off his own fingers.  Horse's ass and face.  By the way, wake up, Boston.  Ticket sales are awful in Boston.  Come on, Boston.  It's a little drive out to Worcester.  We're not going to sugarcoat it anymore.  The ticket sales stink.  Really?  For Worcester.  Get your friends in the armored personnel carrier and drive out to Worcester.  It'll be the best show.  That's what's going to end up happening.  All right.  Petting zoo.  So let's do this then. 
[02:43:00]  Homeland Security's target list, including petting zoos and popcorn stores from the Today Show.  At Amish Country Popcorn, south of Fort Wayne, Indiana, owner Brian Lehman says there isn't a kernel of truth to the notion that his operation is a potential terror target.  Our cornfields are pretty well secured.  But there it is, popping up in a report on the Department of Homeland Security's National Asset Database, listed just after Tennessee's Mule Day Parade.  Also in the database, another Tennessee attraction, the Sweetwater Flea Market. 
[02:43:30]  In Pennsylvania, the Groundhog Zoo.  In Georgia, the Kangaroo Conservation Center.  More than 77,000 listings.  So much, the Inspector General says that it's, quote, of questionable relevance in setting security priorities.  One New York senator mocked the list for including a petting zoo.  Now, I've been to petting zoos when I was a kid.  And I took my children to petting zoos.  But I never saw a terrorist hiding behind one of the sheep in a little Bo Peep's flock. 
[02:44:00]  Hiding behind one of the sheep.  Really?  But did you ever think, you fucking dopey fucking senator, that maybe they do things like that  because this way it completely shakes your foundation of what you do on a daily basis.  Maybe they do attack places.  Like, we can't go to a fucking petting zoo.  And it completely wrecks what you feel it's like.  I wish they would blow up petting zoos.  Oh, I don't.  Stop it.  Sometimes when I hear something, I'll go, oh, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.  Oh.  Good thing to say.  They're done with the building.  They're done with the building thing.  They got to come up with a new gag. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, they're going to come up with a new one.  I wouldn't be against nuking both Israel and Iraq.  Just to end it, it's like 50 dead, then 20 dead, then 50.  Just fucking end it with one, you know.  That's a good strategy.  Both sides, gone.  You know, just say, do you have an hour to get out of Dodge?  That's it.  Just end it.  They love violence, so show them some.  They certainly do.  Yeah, but there'd be people who'd be against that.  Just a few.  I'm breaking up my party.  You can't be abandoned by some countries.  Here's more audio on the... 
[02:45:00]  I think France wouldn't like it.  I'll get you a fucking plutonium.  On the target list.  Here we go.  Many of the places were listed by cities and states as important assets, but nationwide they  varied widely in what they considered valuable.  Some listed all their schools.  Some listed none.  Nebraska reported 200 more assets than the entire state of California.  Homeland Security says the list is intended only as a catalog of places such as arenas,  commercial sites, and government facilities, but was not used on its own to give out grant 
[02:45:30]  money or set security priorities.  It's like a reference in an encyclopedia, a telephone book, 80,000 individual data points  inside the database.  Not necessarily critical in and of themselves.  The Homeland Security Department is now revising this database, giving the states more guidance  on how to concentrate on listing their most important assets.  I'd like a smoothie.  Boy, they got that screwed up. 
[02:46:00]  They don't know where to allocate the fucking money.  That's right.  Give it to New York, because we got fucking kooks around here and savages at every corner.  I ran into one this morning.  Got into another...  You know, it's great that I get to drive in at 4 fucking 15 in the morning and get aggravated  by quarter to five.  I was going to say dawn of the dead time.  There was a cab parked...  Not parked.  57th.  Two lanes going westbound. 
[02:46:30]  Stopped at a light.  I'm behind a cab.  And I'm pulling up to the light.  And I see it's red.  And there's a cab and a huge monster fucking dump truck.  So I'm going to get behind the cab.  The truck's got to...  Oh, he's moving.  Two miles an hour.  But it takes forever for those fucking things to even move.  So I figure I get behind the cab.  Get behind him. 
[02:47:00]  Light turns green.  He's not moving.  He's got his little fucking light on.  And he's doing paperwork at the light.  Okay, fine.  I give him a little...  On the horn.  Nothing.  The truck's now fucking gone.  But I'm stuck behind the cab.  Now I'm laying on the horn.  Guy finally starts moving real slow.  Moves slow enough to where now he's right up next to the truck blocking me.  Doing the same speed as the truck.  So I race around.  At that hour, there's nothing. 
[02:47:30]  So I race into the bus lane on the right.  Go around the truck on the right.  Vroom.  Get caught at the next light.  The cab pulls up next to me.  Rolls his window down.  And starts...  Which just...  And I'm not even reasonable for a second with those people.  I go right for the racial epithets.  Yeah.  You fucking towelhead savage motherfucker asshole terrorist.  You just hit him immediately with that.  Language like that is not...  That's not inclusive.  It is very inclusive. 
[02:48:00]  They're all savages.  Language like that will never get anything accomplished.  And it was right at the light in front of the building.  And then it turned green.  And he drove off.  It drove off.  I was right the first time.  And then Poe gets out of his vehicle.  I'm like, god damn.  Poe should have been there to get him with a punji sticker.  Did they get angrier when you hit him with that racial stuff?  No, it takes him right out of the fucking mix.  Because they know that if they pull anything, I got the support of everyone else around me.  Yeah.  Because he's a fucking savage.  Right.  Stomp him at the ground. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, he's a terrorist motherfucker.  Kill him.  And everybody piles on.  And everybody...  Yeah, we all get off.  He's laying there nude.  We all got hard-ons.  Now what do you do?  You fuck him in the ass, Jimmy.  What else do you do?  Savage.  Get out of my way.  Let's go to Vince in Chicago.  Vince.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Vince.  Hi, Vince.  How are you, Jimmy?  Welcome aboard.  Thank you.  Hey, Ant.  I was...  Sir.  Ant.  I heard yesterday something about Congress passing legislation about online gambling. 
[02:49:00]  I thought you could help me out with that.  I think it's bullshit.  From what I read, they're trying to keep you from using credit cards on online gambling sites.  Never them.  What you do, though, I know I belong to a few sites, and a couple of which,  you buy phone cards with your credit card, then you use the phone card to buy the money  to gamble with.  It takes the credit card thing out of the mix, and I don't think there's anything they 
[02:49:30]  could do about that.  These fucking places are set up on little islands offshore somewhere.  Yeah.  And that's what you're doing.  You're playing online poker or online gambling.  They're trying to throw their weight around and muscle.  They're trying to use muscle so they can find a way to tax it.  They're trying to muscle us.  Sure.  They're trying to muscle.  Profit deal.  All right.  Keep it with the colored people.  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  They're animals anyway, so let them lose their low interest rates.  Let them go to a petting zoo.  Peter. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Peter.  Anthony, I'm worried about you.  You're so angry for such a rich, successful white man.  I get very angry.  I get very angry at cab drivers, and worse than cab drivers.  What?  What about your high blood pressure and all that?  I don't have high blood pressure.  His health won't allow it.  My blood pressure is lower than I defy anybody to find a better blood pressure than mine in  well, probably opi's.  You're right on the money.  How much money do you make, you fucking ditch digger? 
[02:50:30]  My cholesterol is 85.  That's right.  His blood pressure is so low, he can't even get a heart on it.  I can't even have a kid with him.  That's right.  Can't even have a little baby.  His dick is so...  Have you ever killed one of these taxi drivers?  What, sweetie?  Have you ever killed one of these taxi drivers?  No, but when things happen to the livery drivers, I kind of don't feel very bad about it, and  I almost feel good when they're found in, like, the Bronx, over the wheel with a bullet  in their head.  They are the worst. 
[02:51:00]  God.  Yeah.  If you put your ear next to my apartment door, and one of those stories is on the news, you'll  hear the story, and then you'll hear, Tay-Hay-Hay!  Tay-Hay!  They're always found somewhere in the Bronx, some side street, with a bullet in their head.  I know, the money's in a little cigar box, pop, it's just, you know, how long do you  last on that job?  There's always this story about how he came over from Pakistan five years ago, sent money  to his family.  I know.  For a kidney transplant, he gets killed. 
[02:51:30]  It's hilarious.  Good fucking riddance.  Yeah.  Another one off the street.  I know.  They're the worst...  Out of my way!  Rude as fucking drivers.  They stink.  All of them suck.  They don't know how to fucking drive.  You drive all day, you drive for a living, you think you'd get good at it.  No, they're uninsured, yeah, men are fucking...  Yeah, uninsured, you get in an accident with one of them, you're fucked.  Yeah.  Language, young man, this is my home.  One time, it was raining, and I slipped, I slid, because I hit that goddamn paint in  the crosswalk, very slippery. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I stepped on the brakes, and I swear, it was a fraction of a mile an hour.  I hit the back of a cab, and it cracked his taillight lens, and I get out immediately like,  all right, you know, how much is it?  We'll take care of it right now.  Five, five hundred dollars.  Five hundred dollars.  I go, you know something, Ben?  Go fuck yourself.  Go through insurance.  Yeah.  You ain't getting shit out of me.  Five hundred dollars.  Okay, my friend, wait, my friend, two hundred fifty dollars. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, now we're bargaining.  Wow.  Bargaining for a fucking taillight on your old cab.  How much did you give him?  I didn't give him shit.  Yeah, good.  I said go through insurance.  Never heard from him.  I drove away.  I drove away.  Good boy.  I had a cabbie fucking back into me one time.  I was looking at prostitutes, and the cabbie, and some car was chasing the cabbie, like  there was a fight between the two cabbies, so the guy to get away backed up onto my car,  and then fucking drove away, and I chased him.  He lost me.  He lost me.  You got lost.  Dude, he fucking was doing 90 around town. 
[02:53:00]  Grand theft faggot.  And plus, no, no, no.  I had to put my train signal on.  I lost him.  He's signaling during this high-speed chase.  He spins around the George Washington Bridge.  What was I going to do?  Nice work, Lou.  Nice work.  I love to say that.  Let's say hi to Christine in Ohio.  Christine, what's up?  Hey, I'm driving in Ohio, and I need to apologize to a trucker because I missed  a wow.  He beeped at me, and I thought he was being an ass, and I just spoke to pass him, and  I saw his wow sticker after I was past him. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's never good.  Well, why don't you go back, and the way to make up for it is to, while you're driving,  like kind of spin around and open your asshole on the windshield.  Leave a little pucker mark.  Steam on the windshield.  It looks like, it looks like the, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait.  Oh, God damn it.  I can't think of his name.  It looks like Chaka's kiss.  No. 
[02:54:00]  I had my little finger extended.  I couldn't think of Chaka's name.  I always hated Chaka.  All right, Christine.  Better luck next time.  All right.  Thanks.  Next one.  Oh, sorry about that.  Sorry, Christine.  Craig in Massachusetts.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Listen, Opie, you got to sign a tweet to a new contract.  One day, he's going to be the next guy in the post.  DJ driver of death when he fucking kills one of those fucking A-Raps out there.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Although, I was the one that hit somebody in the crosswalk once.  Yeah.  No, you tapped him, as you said.  I tapped a guy. 
[02:54:30]  It was no big deal.  No, in a car, it's no big deal.  When he's a pedestrian, he was walking in the crosswalk.  On purpose?  And Opie tapped him.  Dude, on purpose.  Anthony and I, when we used to drive together, we're on 57th Street.  An infuriating situation in New York is when your light's green.  The light is fucking green.  Yeah.  But you can't move anywhere because there's no traffic.  Oh, yeah.  There's traffic in front of you.  Right.  So now the traffic starts moving.  Now you can go, but now you can't move because the pedestrians have decided, because you 
[02:55:00]  couldn't go because there was traffic in front of you, that they're all going to cross now.  Yep.  Even though it says it's the red hand, don't fucking walk.  They have a don't walk.  So now your traffic clears, but you still can't move.  And they look at you like, hey, where the fuck are you going?  Yeah.  So Opie moves up on this guy.  Because he was purposely going nice and slow, right?  Yeah.  Everyone else kind of hurried through, right?  Sure.  So I'm like, all right.  Well, I started moving forward and I tapped him.  Yeah.  Tapped his kneecap with the fucking bumper.  Great. 
[02:55:30]  The guy, but the guy was like a moose, the big guy.  And I'm in the truck with Opie and I'm not going to even fucking confront this guy.  Get out of here.  The two of us, two fucking idiots.  I start kind of giggling like, look what we just did, right?  Well, he showed us, he goes to Anthony's side, the passenger side, and gives a right  hook to the fucking side view mirror and knocks it right off the Opie's vehicle.  Not off completely though.  It's one of those that you can control from, you know, the armrest.  You know, the heavy duty, the electric. 
[02:56:00]  It's hanging from the cable.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just hanging from the cable.  Knocked it completely off except for the wire is still hanging and one punch.  Wow.  You should have jumped out and said, now how am I going to redo my lipstick?  Oh, God.  No, the only sound you heard after that was the ksk of the auto door locks.  Oh, yeah?  Two faggots.  Looks like two fags.  Driving home.  We were like, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.  12 million people in New York, you've got to hit Alex Karras.  Yeah, the guy hits a moose. 
[02:56:30]  Holy cow.  The guy didn't look like he could do much damage, but he was pissed.  He took the side view out, one punch, no problem.  Did he try to open the door or no?  No, they gave us a look like, what are you going to do about that?  What are you going to do?  And we went, um, nothing.  He must have laughed the whole time.  That must have been his best day ever.  Best day ever for that guy.  We tell that story all the time, and I'm sure he tells that story all the time.  But that is one of the most infuriating fucking things when those pedestrians cross against  the light because they can, because the traffic is tied up the cars, which is fine.  If you want to make a run for it or something, that's fine. 
[02:57:00]  The second it clears up for me and you're in my way, get the fuck out.  And the right lane, people, that ain't a place to stand waiting for the fucking crosswalk  thing to turn green.  They stand in the road.  If more people did what you guys did, they wouldn't pull that shit.  No.  They thought they'd be run over, busted kneecap.  We just got to make sure we hit old ladies and people we can beat up.  One time, no, I had a thing one time where a lady was going slow with a stroller and  to teach her a lesson, I ran the baby over. 
[02:57:30]  That'll teach her.  I didn't want to do it, but I'm like, she'll never do that again.  A little bundle of joy.  That's right.  A curse swish.  Crunch.  That was the noise it made.  Leaving intermittent tire mark of red.  It was like riding a bicycle through a fresh tube of toothpaste.  Oh, God.  Hey, props to Doug Stanhope.  I like Doug.  Oh, Doug.  An ONA mention on his latest CD.  Oh, cool.  That raging alcoholic drug fiend.  Doug's psycho.  I fucking shared a room with him in 95 in the Vale Festival and that fucking kook 
[02:58:00]  sleeps on his bed with all his possessions.  I'm like, what the fuck's the matter with you?  Does he think you're going to rip him off?  Like the whole bed is going to be zapped up and he wants to have everything with him.  All his stuff was on his bed like a lunatic.  Although he likes beer.  Hold on, Bill Burr.  Bill.  Yo.  What's up, bro?  Hey, remember when I was making fun of those guys?  Down in Houston?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  I did that radio show.  Walton and Johnson, I believe.  One guy does like three different voices and doesn't want anyone fessing up to the fact 
[02:58:30]  that he's also the black guy, the gay guy, and the woman.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I guess he heard me and Jim on whatever, us making fun of the show, so one of them  actually sent me a very heated email.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Would you like me to read it?  I certainly would.  Hold on.  Well, I want to make sure the O&A Pests are listening very closely to Bill Burr.  Yes, Pests, you are ready to be briefed.  Okay, Bill Burr?  All right.  It said, okay, so he writes, first of all, the subject is international coverage for W&J. 
[02:59:00]  I don't know what the name of the...  I don't know what their fucking name is.  Walton and Johnson.  Okay, there we go.  I think that's it.  So he said, Richard Jenny has been on the show three times, sag it twice.  Richard Lewis came back and did the show again the next day, liked it the first time.  I guess it's because they were fucking funny.  We have MFOB bookings on the show to help the club, not because we need or want your fabulous talent. 
[02:59:30]  Guess you queered that deal for them.  I don't even know what the fuck that means.  Queered the deal?  Here's the real irony, asshole.  Do you get irony?  Look up the XM numbers today.  Assuming every goddamn receiver is on O&A, which ain't fucking likely, we have more listeners than they do.  Way more.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  So if you're ever in our flagship market again, Houston or Dallas, come see us again in person.  We'll see if we can really get some bleeding from the eyes going. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, no.  I said I had blood.  I did not grow up in any of those eastern shitholes that are supposed to make you street tough, but I think I can hold my own.  Ew, that jerk-off wants to have a fist fight?  Are you going to fight in three different voices, you cocksmoker?  Oh, no.  This guy.  I think he's going to come to me as the black guy.  He didn't say this stuff, did he?  Oh, wait a minute.  You shouldn't have smashed Bill when he left the studio, faggot.  He should have said it to my face. 
[03:00:30]  Of course he should have.  I said I didn't have the greatest.  But, dude, that's the second time I did that show.  Dude, do you realize what the pests are going to do to this show?  I've been waiting for a mission.  And, by the way, I am booked in Houston, and I am booked in Dallas.  I'll give you those dates later if Pete can give them to me.  I'll tell you exactly when I'm in Houston and exactly when I'm in Dallas, and let's hope Club Soda Kenny's available.  Of course, to beat this guy up for you.  You know what the pests hate even more than just people on the show being bashed? 
[03:01:00]  When they bring up all of their listeners, and we have more listeners than they.  That gets the pests so fucking pissed, they will not leave this show alone.  Okay, well, this better really set him over the top, because here comes the part about Jim.  Oh, uh-oh.  The part about Jim Norton?  All right.  He goes, if you ever bump into that bug-eyed fuck Norton, you can tell him not to worry.  He won't never be allowed on anyway. 
[03:01:30]  Good.  He is very humorous, but it's radio.  Just looking funny doesn't count.  Oh, just looking funny doesn't count.  Wait a minute, man.  Did they make fun of my appearance?  He didn't say that.  Bill, let's go.  All right, I give up.  I apologize for that radio show.  Yeah, you better.  If you're going to start teasing my looks, well, that's going to be the end of this war.  That's dirty pool.  All right.  Now, did I say that, or did the funny voice I make up say it? 
[03:02:00]  Fucking zero.  Pest have been gunning for this.  Oh, that's right.  Dude, full attack mode.  Full and complete attack mode, not partial.  We're talking Israeli shit.  We got email addresses?  Wait, I got to read the last couple of lines.  Oh, there's more.  He ends it with, fuck you, coward.  Gee, I hope we didn't burn any bridges here.  And it's like, I wrote the guy back.  It's like, dude, when I did your show, I wasn't rude or disrespectful to you. 
[03:02:30]  I was told not to address that you're doing three different characters.  I didn't have a problem.  I played along.  I thanked him when I left.  Then I go down to the improv, and I have five people come up to me and say, you know,  you trashed me on the air after I left your show.  When I couldn't defend myself, when you're calling me a coward, I basically said to the guy,  all I did on the ONA show was the exact same thing you did in Houston.  So stop being such a fucking baby about it.  You don't need to explain anything.  Did he get back to you?  No, I think he's doing his Tybo tape at this point, getting ready for me to come back again next June. 
[03:03:00]  Well, I think they're on the radio right now, so let's get some numbers.  Come on, phone numbers.  Let's get the phone numbers out there.  A full attack.  I want you guys to kill these motherfuckers with your calls and keep them from being able to take a telephone call.  That's the best when they can't even plunk their own fucking phone lines down.  We'll show them that we have no listeners.  No, just call up and act like you're into the show, and then just try to see if you can somehow say on air that it's the same guy doing the show, 
[03:03:30]  doing all the characters, because evidently that's their big hook.  Bill, I think the pests know how to be pests.  That's why they're called pests.  I think they get it.  What's the website again?  Anybody know?  His email is jwalton10.  Well, email's one thing.  We need phone number for the show.  jwalton10?  Yeah, at huston.rr.com. 
[03:04:00]  Attack.  No one treats our buddy Bill Burr like that.  That's right.  Bill bombs on this show all the time, and we never disrespect him.  No, you're doing it to my face.  Yeah, we get to make fun of his grandma, but no one else is allowed to make fun of Bill Burr.  Jim didn't wait until I left the studio to talk about going down on my grandmother.  He did it right in front of me.  Absolutely.  How could I not with the fucking heart on my head?  jwalton10, Walton, W-A-L-T-O-N, jwalton10, at houston.rr.com. 
[03:04:30]  Number 10, right?  Yes, the number 10.  Bill Burr, the O&A pests have just been waiting for a mission.  What's the number?  What's the number?  People are putting phone numbers up on Pal Talk and Instant Feedback.  I'm not sure if they're right, though.  We need confirmation before we go into attack mode.  Yeah, we'll get all the numbers out there.  Love a good battle.  Hey, how is our intelligence on this one?  It's damn good. 
[03:05:00]  Damn good.  Confidence is high.  Yes.  Bill Burr getting ready for the big gig in Boston, Comedy Connection, all weekend long.  Headlining for the first time in his hometown.  That's cute.  All right, Bill.  I still think I can hold my own.  Oh, shut up.  I think my career's over.  I pissed off Walter and Johnson.  Walton.  Walton.  Whatever.  I should hold my own.  Maybe one of the other voices will pop out.  You won't know who's holding what.  It's like a big conglomerated, monologue studio full of people. 
[03:05:30]  That show fucking stinks.  I'm getting three different numbers here.  I'm going to have to take a karate class to handle multiple attackers when he comes at  me with those three fucking voices.  Yeah, he's going to punch you.  Who wrote you back?  Was it the black guy or the guy?  Well, this is the funny thing.  I don't know who, I don't know if it was the creep who's like the head guy or if it was  the guy who does all the voices.  I assumed it was the guy who did all the voices. 
[03:06:00]  It's both.  Now it's both will pay.  Both will pay.  Well, here's some info.  They call themselves the Radio Guads, G-A-W-D-S.  No, they don't.  Yes, they do.  Their phone number is 1-866-ILOVE-W-J.  Ew.  1-8, oh, the number's up on the pad data right now.  1-866-ILOVE-W-J. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, good.  It's up on the, does Derek know how to spell W-J?  He fucking dope.  Derek really is as dumb as they come.  We'll keep the number up there through the break.  Oh, no, we can't really do that because of how things work.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Phone numbers, write it down.  1-866-ILOVE-W-J.  Let's see if they throw some of our callers on the air today.  And how about some Walton and Johnson fans?  You guys want to call up and trash us?  Feel free.  Let them give out this number, too, so if they hear it, they can give this number out.  No.  If someone's in the area and they're on, we'd like to monitor the program. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, let's do that as well.  So get it on your radio.  Give us a call, and we'll listen on the phone.  I'm funny-looking.  I didn't think I was funny-looking.  That was hurtful and unnecessary.  He is humorous.  All I said was that your show is shit and you're a fraud because you do voices and expect  the comic to have an honest interaction, and yet the whole thing you're doing is dishonest.  It's fake.  It's a fucking phony nonsense.  He basically ended his email with that old bar-filled joke. 
[03:07:30]  Hey, kid, you got a great face for radio.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that really is awful.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, Norton's really funny.  Dot, dot, dot.  Lookin'.  Lookin'.  Spelled L-O-O-K-I-N with the little apostrophe after the end.  Oh, God.  You fucking dope.  We love beating up our own, but no one else is allowed to beat up our own.  Hey, now, this is not Jim talking.  This is the other black guy talking.  You can't mess with my friend.  Oh, dear, you shouldn't mess with him.  That wasn't me.  That was a black guy and a lady.  My God, we got a whole full crew here. 
[03:08:00]  The fucking nerve of you to expect a comic to sit there and fucking play along with that  shit.  Wow.  Dribble.  Imagine having to sit and fucking play to one guy that's making like he's three and  don't let the secret out.  Yeah.  Oh, it's just between us.  The first thing you'd have to say is, why are you doing that?  Hush, hush.  Stop it.  Hush, hush.  Tee, hee, hee.  It's between us.  Tee, hee, hee.  The only time you should be doing that is if you're holding a puppet and calling an old  lady a cunt.  That's right.  That's the only time that works. 
[03:08:30]  At least if there was a puppet, I'd have something to look at instead of looking at this.  But even then, man, I'm not making excuses because I definitely, that wasn't a great  appearance on their fucking show.  But if you're going to trash me, do it to me.  Don't be like smiling.  Hey, thanks for coming in.  And then let me fucking leave.  And then you open your big face.  And they were the ones, yeah.  They drew first blood.  And dude, I will also acknowledge I did not have a great appearance at all on their show.  And it's okay.  I've had bad appearances before. 
[03:09:00]  But I will throw myself under the bus.  But I will drag the 40 people in that studio.  Oh, wait.  It's just two.  And say that the fucking vibe, it was like, they're like, hey, man, we just went back on  the air.  We know you're on XM.  They had just come back into Houston.  They were paranoid.  And there was no, they don't even look at you.  They don't even look at you.  It was two fucking older gentlemen looking at each other.  And you're in the fucking side piping.  And it was fucking horrendous.  Here we go.  Wes in Houston.  Wes.  Watch them out, Jim.  They might want to beat you up, too.  I know.  I don't want to get beat up because I'm funny looking. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, go ahead, Wes.  All right.  Let's listen to Wes from Houston.  Wes.  I'm here.  Hi, Wes.  You got him on?  You all ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's hear.  Hold on.  Steve is captured.  We need to record it.  Thanks, buddy.  It's a good start.  I like people that are at least thinking outside the box.  I'm thinking about becoming a villain.  Fucking two haters.  You have to become a alien.  Can you all hear that okay?  Yeah.  Keep it going.  Just leave it there.  Security benefits.  I don't have to worry about the IRS dogging me all the time because I'm not even a citizen.  I can still vote in all the elections. 
[03:10:00]  I can still get free health care out of the emergency room.  I can still send my kids to the school.  That's trash.  Boring.  Pretty damn good plan not being a citizen.  Take a call.  Take a call.  You can't really get decent health coverage now when you go to the office.  That's a guy doing the chick's voice.  Or is that the gay voice?  We don't know.  Oh, God.  It doesn't even sound like a chick.  It sounds like him a little higher.  This is like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. 
[03:10:30]  I wish he'd have a breakdown and as the black guy, shoot everybody.  Korean missiles, but I got a real problem there.  Billy, yeah, I go to a lot of trouble to wax my mustache.  You know, it's a good looking big old thick mustache.  Fucking hayseeds.  Oh, my God.  All these guys are coming up to me and saying,  Man, that is a bad-ass mustache.  Hey, you guys, follow that.  Follow that, he says to us.  How do you guys think you can follow that, Heath? 
[03:11:00]  I don't know.  They're bringing it.  I would be a little concerned about how many men are coming up to you.  Hitting on you.  I do.  I will say this.  The mustache is not nearly as popular with the women as it was several years ago.  The women today are going like the men or preferring shave.  Yeah, you know what?  And I haven't seen you and your mustache, but I just haven't seen you.  You're not a woman.  You're a guy.  Hey, dude.  That was the female voice or the gay voice?  I don't even know.  It sounds like there's a whole bunch of people in that studio. 
[03:11:30]  It certainly does.  That's not a good thing.  You look like a porn star or...  I liked this show when it was called Phil Hendry.  You're not a woman.  You're a guy.  Curl it up on the hands a little bit.  See?  Phil Hendry's brilliant when he does it.  You guys stink.  He's twisted into the tips of the mustache.  The mustache.  Head up.  Backwards, douchebags.  No, no, see if it's on, oh.  All the pests are now organizing.  We're seeing they're putting out the website where they're streaming the show so they can 
[03:12:00]  listen to it live as they then see when they take some phone calls and get in there.  We're going to need someone to tape, you know, calls.  I'm sure it's happening.  All right, good.  These guys have battle stations.  They know exactly what to do, where to go.  Yeah.  They record it.  They completely turned it over to...  I'm sure the screener is going fucking bullshit.  They're still over in Afghanistan.  Oh, okay.  Please do the black eye character.  This is the one.  What are you talking about? 
[03:12:30]  We want the black eye character.  Yeah, we want to hear the black eye character.  Maybe he took the day off.  He's lazy fuck.  He's late.  I'm going with that.  Guys, you all want me to talk about that?  He was arrested for raping the white character.  Huh?  You all want me to call back when the clones start...  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Yes.  Because we can't listen to that drill.  I'll call you back in.  I can't handle listening to too much.  It's awful.  All right, just sit there and have a few laughs.  All right.  Those guys are tough.  Let's say hi to Chris in Houston.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, boy? 
[03:13:00]  Hey.  Hey, about the Super Bowl that happened in 2004 here in Houston, Jay Moore had a problem  with them as well.  What was the problem?  Who's Jay Moore?  He said that he wasn't being funny enough for them, and, you know, same shit that they did  Yeah, their favorite movie is Hooper.  Stupid fucking Hicks.  Hooper.  Hooper.  Hooper.  Wow.  All right, Chris.  Thanks, man.  It sounds like it's a bad vibe to do comedy. 
[03:13:30]  It was...  Well, when I first got it, it was just the vibe was awful.  And again, I'm certainly not saying I was great.  I'll be honest.  I know when I'm good.  You are, Drake.  Shut up.  Yeah, right.  I was good.  They didn't get it.  LOL.  Of course you are.  No, I was mediocre at best kind of bordering on shitty.  But just the vibe in there stunk, and the fact they would trash Bill.  Yeah.  We don't have him on because we need comedians on.  We're doing a favor for the club.  Are you really?  So you have all these millions of listeners, and you're throwing bad comedians on as a  favor to the improv, you fucking liars? 
[03:14:00]  And that just goes to show you, like, Bill's one of those guys that could just come in,  hang out, and bullshit about whatever's going on and stuff like that.  You know, they probably want, you know, pieces of people's act.  All right, here we go.  We got it.  Fuck them.  Do my act.  But like I said, I don't mind.  You trash them.  Just do it when I'm there.  Yeah.  Actually, it would have been funny.  It's a punk move.  Like, yeah, you know what?  But don't.  They, like, was, like, serious, like, don't go see this guy kind of shit that they were  saying.  And at that point, it's like, you know, you're fucking with my show at that point. 
[03:14:30]  And that goes beyond just, you know, busting balls.  Fucking with your livelihood.  Let's say hi to Gary and Dallas.  Here's background on them.  Taking food out of my children's mouth.  Hey, that's my bread and butter.  Hey, how about I go to?  Gary.  All right.  They came here in the, about 84, lasted for about a year and a half from New Orleans.  Got kicked off the radio and sent back down to New Orleans.  Their ratings were never anything.  So, here they are trying to make you back to Dallas again.  Didn't even know they were back. 
[03:15:00]  When I drive to work every day, all I see are ONA signs all over town.  You guys rock.  Oh, thank you, guys.  So, they're on in the morning in Dallas, too, right?  We're barely on in the morning in Dallas.  They are.  Yeah, that will change.  Have a chicken fried steak and drag the nigga character from the back of a pickup truck.  Fucking Jew haters.  Dot com.  Otto and George.  Hey, Bill, thank you so much.  All right.  Not a problem.  Enjoy the comedy connection this weekend in Boston. 
[03:15:30]  All right, guys.  I'll see you next week.  All right, good.  Bill Burr, everyone.  We'll take care of the situation.  The pest will.  To battle stations.  Yeah.  All right, we got to take a break.  We'll get into some other things in just a bit.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass. 
[03:16:00]  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the PF thing.  Put it between the boobs. 
[03:16:30]  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite floral treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big fat juicy cock.  That's the right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  A big wad has come right into my mouth.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, God.  After I suck you up, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard-milled cock.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh, I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy hoving my mouth. 
[03:17:30]  I enjoy hoving between the boobs.  I enjoy hoving my tight ass.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  The People Eat and Anthony Show.  Otto, did I just hear that you're going to be playing the Thirsty Turtle? 
[03:18:00]  Yep.  The Thirsty Turtle.  All the big gigs for our pal.  Yeah, it's a shitty audience, but there's a lot of hot women there. 
[03:18:30]  They fucking hated me the first time I played there, and the guy wants me back for more money.  Where was it?  Stanford, Connecticut?  Stanford?  I don't know.  Stanford?  Yeah.  Hey, Demi.  Anybody?  Yeah.  The Thirsty Turtle.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's July 29th.  And I'm in Houston.  Pete just told me the date, and I forgot.  It's like the 17th.  That weekend, around the 17th.  Can you check the Houston Improv's website?  Because I'm there in Houston.  Next week, right?  No, no, no.  August.  Oh, okay, okay.  And Glenn Miller's on that show with me.  Glenn Miller. 
[03:19:00]  Don't forget your book, douchebag.  The Glenn Miller?  Well, no, he's a great comic.  Satan's comic.  That would be a hell of a show.  Yeah.  Pull his corpse on stage and let people see it.  I have Benny Goodman middling for me in Houston.  And I talked to Pete about hopefully Otto being on the show.  I heard that story.  I liked it, yeah.  Yeah, we're trying to add Otto and Julian's video on a traveling virus.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Lee in Michigan.  Lee.  Hey.  Hi, Lee.  I just thought I would give you a holler and let you all know since y'all gave out that number. 
[03:19:30]  I've been trying to call that stupid-ass show and I can't get through.  I imagine that they're going to be getting a few phone calls.  Yes, just a few with the no listeners that we have.  I like to sit down to a chicken fried steak in my favorite movie, Stroke Erase.  Don't kick an ass.  Punch it out.  All right, thank you.  Reset your...  That's a funny movie.  Reset your camera there, Than.  Okay.  What, the Paltor camera?  Yeah, it's down.  Reset it before we kick it over. 
[03:20:00]  You've got to shut it off and turn it back on.  Hey, Otto, what do you think of tattoos?  Tattoos?  Yeah.  Oh, black eyes with tattoos?  Yeah.  You see a black eye?  Yo, man, check out my new tattoo.  What tattoo?  I don't see nothing.  Where is it?  You should have used whiteout, you fucking idiot.  You should have bought sneakers.  Run from the police.  Run.  You're guilty.  Oh, no.  No, he was talking about the tattoo from Fantasy Island.  Oh, his biography, right?  Tattoos was an alcoholic midget dating a girl 5'10". 
[03:20:30]  And the girl said, he was an out-of-control, drunken midget.  I didn't know what to do.  How about put the Jack Daniels on the top shelf, you stupid cunt?  He'll never find it.  He's a midget.  That's almost material.  Hey, I don't do a material for us.  Once, for once, break down and do something for my stupid shelf.  We can't get enough of Tattoo, by the way.  We had a lot of fun with him.  Oh, well, we did the whole thing talking about, yeah, Herve Villach. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  How he leaned against the glass door with the pillow and his gun and shot himself.  Shot himself in, like, the gut.  Really?  And just sat there with a tape recorder rolling.  There's a tape of him just going, ow, ow.  And no one released the tape.  Who the fuck doesn't want to hear that?  Oh, my God.  I don't want to hear, oh, it hurts.  It hurts.  Oh, God.  You kill him, all this be mine.  Little despondent fuck. 
[03:21:30]  I really passed.  Doug Stanhope gave us a little plug on his latest CD.  He did?  He's only been on our show once.  We love Doug Stanhope.  We've got to get him on.  Doug's a good boy.  A little more often, but.  What a great drug story.  This is what he had to say off his latest CD.  God, I got a designated drinker.  Could you can have half of that for me, Captain?  Oh, you're the Opie and Anthony guy.  You're the fucking, you're the worst.  No, no, no.  Opie and Anthony and Stern, I love. 
[03:22:00]  It's the fucking noodle heads who act.  Everything has to be about, fuck Stern, Opie and Anthony.  Fuck Opie and Anthony.  They're both just stirring.  And they're both fucking good.  And they're bringing a medium that's actually getting me recognized to light.  If you don't have fucking satellite radio, get it.  Don't listen to this fucking dipshit and shithead in the morning.  Dude, you don't believe.  They're both good.  Opie and Anthony, good.  What?  And you got the name wrong. 
[03:22:30]  It was Walton and Johnson.  Yeah, why did he have to not throw in Stern to ruin the plug for this moment?  You fucking jerk.  He's got to cover all his bases.  Oh, yeah.  Bastard.  I know.  You know what comedians are.  It's good.  Speaking of Walton and Johnson, we got some of their bits, everybody.  Oh, thank God.  They call themselves the Radio Gawd.  I can't wait.  G-A-W-D.  That's how you say it.  Isn't that such a cool way to say it?  Yeah.  Those guys are good.  Hold on.  We got some for Otto.  Larry in Minnesota. 
[03:23:00]  Larry!  Hey!  Hey, where can we get Otto and George's CDs at?  Go to his MySpace, I guess, right?  No, laugh.com.  Oh, laugh.com.  Yeah.  For Otto and George CDs.  All righty.  Yeah.  Laugh.com.  All righty.  Funny and Stroker Ace.  His shit is great.  All right, here we go.  Walton and Johnson.  Some of their bits.  T.O.'s audiobook.  Terrell Owens, I believe, yes.  Uh-huh. 
[03:23:30]  So they got a little bit called T.O.'s audiobook.  Okay.  Walton and Johnson, everybody.  This is probably the black-eyed character, by the way.  Oh, good.  I want to hear that one.  Yeah.  Get a nigga puppet.  It's not going to surprise me if this is the black-eyed character.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  It's not working.  Why would it work?  Thans up, though.  I don't know what I'm doing.  This should...  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I...  Oh, you belong in this...  Is it stuck?  Oh, no.  Nazi.  Oh, no.  I told you to leave it alone. 
[03:24:00]  It's a very important work of art.  I think E-Rock's pretty good at, uh...  E-Rock!  Matt in Queensbury.  Good evening.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm using you to stall.  Go.  Oh, well, uh...  Just want to let you know that since you gave out the number to the Masters and Johnson  there, it was like 10 minutes ago or whatever, I've called that non-stop, and it's been  that circuit overload busy.  Yeah.  So they're definitely getting bombarded by the...  I bet you they're not acknowledging it either.  Good luck.  And this is a lot different than other radio shows. 
[03:24:30]  We will not stop.  No, this will just keep going and going.  And even if the callers don't get through, a few will, believe me, but even if they don't,  you take their calls out of the mix.  Now they've got to sit there and do a show.  And also, this phone screener is very unhappy.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  You guys are the Beatles, and they're the fucking Dave Clark Five, so fuck Houston.  They had a couple of hits.  Thank you, Otto.  All right, here we go.  So it's T.O.'s audio book.  Which one am I? 
[03:25:00]  I don't want to be Harrison.  He had a little thing under his hat.  Old pudding head.  Thing under his hat?  Yeah, brain cancer.  Oh, jeez.  You're the, um...  There's no boundaries with you guys.  You're so wacky.  Oh, stop me before.  Stop me.  Here we go.  That's the gay character.  I don't want to be the one that fucks old Popsicle stick leg, either.  That's true.  We're the one that stops to sign everything thrown in front of them.  I just want to be the shit dick drummer.  That's who I want to be. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, God.  Language, young man.  This is my home.  My new book by Terrell Owen.  Oh, God.  In the beginning, God created T.O.  Because the rest of the world was void and without form and without the best receiver  in NFL history.  And God saw that T.O. was good.  Real damn good.  Oh, boy.  And on the seventh day, he rested.  Nice production value.  Kind of chasing T.O.  Into the end zone.  And T.O. got so fast that when he ran at full speed, he was traveling in time.  And he was able to score points in games that had already been played. 
[03:26:00]  In fact, if you look at pictures of Super Bowl I, you see T.O. standing next to Vince  Lombardi telling him, I got to get my dollars up, bitch.  And then one day, T.O. run right off the face of the earth and scored points in space and  got signed by an advanced race of Asian people who didn't have a quarterback to get T.O.  And one day in the distant future, scholars would remember T.O. as one of them Greek mystological  figures.  And T.O. promised to return one day. 
[03:26:30]  Bringing the people of the earth to peace, love, joy, and a whole bunch of T-shirts available  at TerralOwns.com.  I love myself.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know how we compete against this.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Do you?  Oh, that was fucking an abomination.  Yeah.  Ma, please, stop calling me. 
[03:27:00]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, goodbye.  I'm not going to order.  I have to do this now.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Oh, great.  Oh, what was that?  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, Mick friend.  Excuse me.  I'm not German-Irish.  I'm a black-white female gay.  God.  Oh, wait.  We might have got our first one through. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, nice.  Let's go to Jeff in Texas.  Jeff.  Hi, you're back, boys.  Hi, Jeff.  Hi, what's going on?  Go ahead.  Hi, I got the Warren and Johnson show on.  Someone just wished Jimmy a happy birthday.  They wished me a happy birthday.  Thank you.  I laughed so hard I had to stop my tractor.  Stupid.  Got you out of my line-up.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  Well, right away, he's just kidding little fucking manners. 
[03:28:00]  I'm breaking your balls on you.  Right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  I'm getting fucking fresh.  Let's go to Mark in Connecticut.  Mark.  Fresh.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  That's great.  Let's go, Mark.  My wife got through.  Yeah.  And they said, oh, yeah, you sound like you're from up north.  What are you, another O-day fan clicked?  Hung up the phone.  Wow.  Good.  Hey, they put the challenge out there.  You sound like you're from up north.  Yeah.  Heading through, so.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jason in Houston.  I bet you like the colored folk, too, don't you? 
[03:28:30]  Well.  Yeah, somebody called in wishing Jimmy a happy birthday.  Thank you.  I was pretty happy about that.  All right.  And then they started bragging about, oh, we've got a dump button.  You probably don't know that, so.  Yeah, we'll tie that dump button up the whole show, asshole.  Real brave.  They put out the challenge real brave.  We are not going to dump out of any Walton and Johnson callers.  You call up and you want to trash us because you like that show, fine.  No one is going to dump out.  We're the Israel of radio.  That's right. 
[03:29:00]  We're not tough, but we are Jewish.  You guys were Sex for Sam, and that was really stupid, and they really made note of that.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Those guys really, that's fucking good.  Wait, what did they say?  They made note of how stupid Sex for Sam was, and that I'm ugly.  Boy, they really hit below the belt.  Wow.  How do they find these inside facts out?  I like brain cancer.  Yeah, Sex for Sam was really stupid.  It made us multimillionaires.  Why don't you fucking, did it?  Yeah.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Multi-millionaire? 
[03:29:30]  Wait a minute.  I mean, well, I mean, well.  I didn't know.  Multi-  You said millionaires, and I remember we were all talking, and you're like, no, three  ways, all for one, one for all.  Here we go.  Andy in Texas.  Andy.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hello.  Yes, you're on the phone, mister.  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  I'm going to go through first on the Wallace and Johnson, or Walkman and Johnson show.  Yeah.  What about them?  Yeah, I wish little Jimmy a happy birthday, and I got in that, I was in Dallas and saw 
[03:30:00]  this play, Three Rides Make a Left, and saw little Jimmy Norton.  Oh, if that was you, man, thanks a lot.  Thanks, Andy.  All right.  All right.  You're a good boy.  See, these guys, these guys love this shit.  It's what they do.  They won't stop.  It's all they do.  They're jobless animals.  Hey, you want to hear another bit from the Walton and Johnson show?  I don't know.  Let me sit down first, because I doubled over laughing so hard, I almost fell. 
[03:30:30]  Put on your laughing hats.  It's a song parody.  Oh, no.  Oh, great.  How do you stop laughing?  It's so overproduced and unfunny.  It's just, you know, it's unintelligible.  A song parody?  Well, maybe you didn't hear the part where T.O. went into space and scored points out there.  I had quite a laugh at that, because there's nothing in space.  Oh, God.  That is funny.  Song parody of Paperback Rider.  Oh.  Changing the words to mean immigrant driver.  About as funny as a wheelchair ramp. 
[03:31:00]  Fucking suck.  No.  Lab.com.  Get your auto and George CD.  Auto is the fucking funniest guy ever.  Immigrant driver.  Oh, I'm already douche-chilling.  This is terrible.  This sucks.  This sucks.  He's got no license, couldn't read the book.  Now watch him take a turn and have a tickle loop.  Shut up!  He came from Asia or from Mexico. 
[03:31:30]  Now he's got a car, but not a residence.  In the Grand Driver.  Stop it!  Stop it!  In the Grand Driver.  Stop it!  You sick!  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  Oh, those guys are fine!  Excuse me, but I do believe that sounds bad.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Are you fucking with me? 
[03:32:00]  The Grand Driver.  The Grand Driver.  He sits below the wheel, he can barely see.  He can't miss the train, quite illegally.  Shut up!  Shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  That's terrible. 
[03:32:30]  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah.  It's fucking awful.  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Nicole in Houston.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, you're all the same guy.  Fucking zilch.  It's the board op, too.  The same guy.  We woke up Houston today.  Nicole in Houston.  What's up?  Well, I just called through, and they asked who I was calling from, and I said Houston.  They said we're not letting anybody else through because of the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course.  There you go.  There's your brave radio.  There's your brave radio.  We have no listeners.  Radio gods.  The radio gods.  They're the brave radio gods.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, miss?  I just bought tickets to your show, and I'm super excited. 
[03:33:30]  Thank you.  Stan, what are the dates?  August 17th through the 19th.  August.  August.  17th through the 19th.  I'm at the Houston Improv.  Let's get a number and get this rolling.  August.  Yes.  Well, they better not come through Houston.  Why?  What are you going to do, stupid?  You going to show up and blow me while I'm selling merchandise?  Fuck yourself.  Rick from Houston.  Rick.  Hey, y'all quit fucking calling the goddamn show down there.  Y'all fucking shit up.  I can't get through or nothing. 
[03:34:00]  Y'all just screwing a good thing up.  Oh, yeah?  You're lying.  What good thing?  We can tell you're a fan of this show.  That was awful.  Y'all screwing a good thing up.  Surgery.  Surgery.  Sugary.  Hi, Sugary.  Sugary.  Hi, Sugary.  I listen to them in the morning instead of you guys.  Okay.  I listen to them afterwards, and the reasons are, Opie, you're an S.  Thank you.  Anthony, you've got a pretty level head.  And Jimmy, you're going to be at Zaney's in Tennessee. 
[03:34:30]  21st, 22nd.  We want a real.  No, and he gave the dates wrong.  You little bastard.  It's 27 through 29 of July.  Oh, what's that for, you bastard?  Jeff in Houston.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Jeff?  I don't know why you think those bits aren't funny.  Elvis.  We really want to fight.  I don't know why I don't think they're not funny.  That was fucking Kevin Bacon from JFK.  You're a handsome man, Mr. Walton.  You're not a bad-looking man, Mr. Johnson. 
[03:35:00]  Time for another Walton and Johnson bit.  For the radio.  Yeah, come on.  Come over, folks.  Laughs are a-coming.  I don't know why we do this.  I don't know why we help another show like this by playing their bits and showing people  how great they are.  Because the bits are terrific.  This is called Pimp the Hose.  Pimp the Hose.  I bet the black guy shows up.  Oh, my.  He does the T.O. song, too.  This guy doesn't stop.  Song parody of Barry Manilow's song.  Oh, my goodness.  This is going to be a gem.  I can sense it.  God damn rich cunt. 
[03:35:30]  Let's go to Theo in Virginia.  Theo.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Theo?  Hi, Theo.  I got through for a second.  I don't think it was on air.  I think they're in a commercial or something.  Yeah.  But the guy's like, you guys can stop calling.  You don't think you're going to break us, do you?  And his voice all cracked and all the way.  Great.  Yeah.  Wait until it starts again tomorrow and then Monday.  You geese.  I think the whole month of July should just be punished, these guys.  But they trashed Bill when he left, and that's the bottom line.  They have more listeners of the Opie and Anthony show, and they insulted my appearance, 
[03:36:00]  and as we all know, I happen to be damn cute.  All right.  Thank you, Theo.  Bug-eyed and ugly.  They have no idea what they should do.  And hurtful.  Here's Pimp the Hose.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  You know they're going to go all the way to the end of this song.  Yeah.  It's going to be the whole song.  Yeah, not even 20 minutes.  Wait a minute's thought.  I've been in the hood forever, and I smoked the very first crack. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, no.  I put the cane and the baking soda together.  I'm a wigger, and I pimp the hose.  What?  I pimp the hose, and wear some booyah blade.  I'm murk fools, because you know I am king. 
[03:37:00]  I got dubs and snow bunnies, too.  I pimp the hose.  I pimp the hose, I pimp the hose.  Do ya?  Oh, my shorties reach in your pants.  Ah.  Wear a chilly hat, don't take a chance.  And I got them three ways, if you can pay.  It's over, Johnny.  Gold teeth fill up my mind.  You're just a tool.  An extra 50, you can take her south. 
[03:37:30]  They do me, they do you, they do you, they do me.  It's an urban orgy.  Ah!  I pimp the hose, and wear some booyah blade.  It's always good to repeat things in song parody.  Are we done with this?  No!  I'm trying to have a laugh. 
[03:38:00]  Tell him, Fred!  I pimp the hose, I pimp the hose.  This is just punishment.  This is just punishment now.  I pimp the hose, and wear some booyah blade.  I murk fools, good to repeat things.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant Jedi.  What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?  Fine.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock. 
[03:38:30]  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  I try to do.  I'm a wigger, and I pimp the hose.  Do you want to kiss me, or do you want to kiss me on the mouth?  Hello, exactly!  We look like assholes right now, man!  Well, the phones are coming in like crazy.  Danny in Texas.  Danny?  What's up?  Welcome aboard, Dan.  I got through for like three seconds, and the only thing I got to say was, 
[03:39:00]  you sure have got a pretty mouth, and then they hung up on me.  Yeah.  Houston Improv.  Since they challenge anyone to come down, August 17 through 19, I will be there.  August 17 through 19, here's the number, 713-333-8800, 713-333-8800.  Well, no shit.  August 17 through 19, August.  Well, how about pediatric theater, guys? 
[03:39:30]  What's that?  This will be the last Walton and Johnson beer.  We don't want to promote these guys.  These were posted on their website, so they were very proud of these beers.  This is like the best of the best.  Cream of the crop, as it were?  Yes.  Wow.  Oh, look at this.  This thread.  Bill and Houston.  We heard them all before, boys.  Bill.  Yeah, they just called the Wallace and Gromit show, and they said they're going to start  tracing our phone calls.  Ew!  These zilches mean shit.  Let me tell you something.  I'm out. 
[03:40:00]  Here's the word of advice.  If you're a radio show, and you're trying to be funny, and you have to resort to using  the FBI, you're not a funny radio show.  We're going to report you.  There's nothing a station can do if people are calling their line to get through.  Do you know there's nothing they can do?  Yeah.  It's a public station.  Yeah.  The pests already know that.  The pests know all the rules.  They laugh at that.  We got lawyers that ruin a pest.  Yeah.  Wow.  That help out the other pests.  One of our biggest pests is an ex-police officer slash fucking psychopath. 
[03:40:30]  Well, one more bit from these wonderful radio shows.  Why are we promoting the competition, Opie?  They're going to get millions of listeners from this.  This is called the movie game with kids.  Oh, God.  I need Strychnine.  Wow.  It's another one all the way through.  Will you follow me?  No, no.  I was talking about a pest.  Wow.  Are you still here?  Yeah.  Are you growing your mustache back?  Yeah.  I see.  I see a little stubble.  No, don't grow it back.  You don't.  No, grow it back.  No, Anthony doesn't care about your life.  Without the mustache, it looks like a half a honeydew melon. 
[03:41:00]  All right.  I'll try to please everyone somehow.  Your job is to be intimidating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't look as intimidating without that dopey cop mustache.  Really?  You look kissable.  Unless, like I said, a Hitler mustache.  All right.  You look sweet.  We'll work it out.  Bring that look back.  Really?  Yeah.  Kenny, I got a job for you.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  We, uh...  The slum landlord has finally made contact.  Don't kill him.  Can you...  Here, here, here.  Give it to a Jew congressman in another district. 
[03:41:30]  Not our chinless cop.  He will pick up if you use my phone.  We know cops with our chins.  Dirty cops.  Go, go, go.  All right.  Crooked cop.  Crooked cop.  Guys, the movie game.  Cop that tell dirty jokes.  The movie game.  And by the way, Kenny, I'm not talking to him.  I'm busy all day.  The voicemail.  Figures.  Maybe he's calling his lawyers because he's scared.  Maybe he's calling the Walton and Johnson show.  Just say glub, glub, glub into his voicemail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Here's the pediatric theater. 
[03:42:00]  The movie game with kids.  Oh, you're through.  Well, let me retort.  Would you describe for me what Marcellus Wallace looks like?  What country are you from?  What?  What ain't no country I know.  Do they speak English in what?  What?  English, mother f***er.  Do you speak it?  Yes.  Then you understand what I'm saying. 
[03:42:30]  Yes.  Now describe what Marcellus Wallace looks like.  What?  Say what again?  Say what again?  I dare you.  I don't dare you, mother f***er.  Say what one more guy.  That kid's cursing is funny.  Now describe to me what Marcellus Wallace looks like.  Well, he's, he's, he's black.  Go on.  And he's, he's tall.  Does he look like a b***h?  No. 
[03:43:00]  Then why are you trying to f*** him?  Like a b***h?  I did it.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did, Brett.  You tried to f*** him.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?  Yes.  There's a passage.  You guys know nothing about editing, you know?  Just, we get it.  Just stop.  It goes on for another, it goes on for another two minutes.  We know the scene.  Another two minutes?  Actually, that could have worked.  The laugh's there for a second, but not the whole f***ing movie.  Yeah, kids are cursing.  It's a good scene in a movie that everybody likes.  So it's got all the features, but they just don't, they f***ing drill it into the ground. 
[03:43:30]  And then what was with all the smashing s***?  That scene was quiet up until they blew his f***ing head off.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have not heard from him in quite a while.  It's Doug out.  Doug.  Hi, Doug.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Hey, Doug.  We'll have a Pow Talk room set up at 5.30 tomorrow morning, and we'll be streaming their show  so everybody can partake in what we like to call an attack.  They're an hour behind us, though. 
[03:44:00]  What's that?  I think they're an hour behind, right?  An hour behind?  So what time is it?  So it's 5.30 Eastern, I believe.  Which would be 4.30 there.  That'll be 4.30 their time.  That's 4.30 their time, Doug.  All right.  Let's do the math.  That's great.  The Pest War Room.  The General.  Synchronize your watches, idiot.  As they sit there and wait for an hour and a half.  I know.  Doug's just yelling, I want that whole goddamn tree line bomb!  It'll be fun just listening to the overnight Josh just babble about nothing. 
[03:44:30]  I want you to put that pontoon up a rest!  Just the flare!  We'll have to figure out a way to get the FM people in on this.  Yeah, we'll talk about it tomorrow morning, believe me.  It's 6.30 you should start, because I think that's 5.30 in Houston.  Yeah, remind us tomorrow, Doug.  You can call the other show, and we'll get the other side of the show involved, too.  Hang on a second.  Was I right with the 5.30?  I don't know.  5.30 would be 4.30 in Houston, right?  5.30 here is 4.30 there.  They're an hour behind.  Wednesday is Sunday. 
[03:45:00]  That's right.  At Carville.  Thinny-thin.  We have fatty, fat friends.  Tillis Stiller is Bo Derek.  Let's say hi to John.  Bo G to Will.  Yeah, fine.  John?  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, John?  Hi.  Hey, I just heard on my radio show down here.  What's going on with you guys?  Why do you guys got to keep calling and screwing with these folks?  Folks.  They suck.  That's why.  Folks.  Folks.  I've been listening to these guys for a long time.  Put your head under a fucking tractor wheel, then.  Yeah, well, you can tell your fucking dugout, Doug. 
[03:45:30]  If he wants to talk, he can see me at Norton's show on August 17th and 8th.  Your mother's cunt, Ben.  Your mother's cunt.  Thank you, mister.  We need people that really hate us.  Hey, dude.  If he wants to talk about August 17th through 19th, me at the Houston,  Improv, then that boy can do something.  Your mother's cunt.  Let's hear somebody endorsing Jim.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  I don't like to insult me.  All right, Doug, you're getting organized.  We are getting organized.  We've got, I believe he was trying to sell something on the Internet. 
[03:46:00]  One of the two, and we've got his home number also.  We're getting all the information together on the 418.com attack forum.  There's a thread going on a whack bag for it.  So everybody's getting together, and we're all going to meet tomorrow morning in our pal talk room  and stream the show and dial the phone.  Now, Doug, Doug, remember, keep everything legal, yet make it as annoying as is humanly possible for that show. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, definitely.  I just hope nobody swears on the air and makes them run out of dump or anything like that.  No, we wouldn't want that.  Oh, we wouldn't want that.  No profanity.  We wouldn't want that.  You never want to start and go, look, I really love you guys.  Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, because they have the dump out, and it's ruined.  By the way, they're on 530 to 10 Central Time.  So we'll have some maps ready so you can call from a local area.  And don't forget about the spoof tells so we can get around the phone screeners if they have any caller ID.  We've got everything set up.  It's all set.  You have a way to spoof it so it looks like you're calling from Houston? 
[03:47:00]  Yes.  Jesus.  Yeah, they know how to believe me.  What's going on over there is...  It's fucking NORAD.  It really is frightening.  Just unplug the goddamn thing.  Clothe down the mountain.  We haven't done anything.  We haven't done anything for a while.  I know.  We saw you chomping at the bit on the message board, so we're ready to rock on these guys.  We've been kind of hanging out, letting you guys get the FM thing going, and then we just want to strike and make ourselves look good.  Hope they're not getting all fat.  Hope you've been keeping trained. 
[03:47:30]  Got to have our troops in training all the time.  That's right.  All right.  Actually, they have to stay fat.  That's just what they are.  They're all fat.  They're all messes.  Thanks, man.  Right now, fucking Bam is taking his Dockers out.  I want to fucking just throw cow's blood on those Dockers and watch it fucking roll right off.  Fucking Bam wears stain-free slacks.  Marty in South Dakota.  Where is he?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Marty.  Hey, man.  You know, I can't figure it out, man.  How long have you guys been at this shit? 
[03:48:00]  For a long time, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And these fucking idiots at these other radio stations can't figure out how many listeners you guys have.  And if they challenge you, they're going to get fucked.  I mean, come on.  How stupid are they?  Well, we'll find out how stupid they are.  I just hope that they don't start whipping out the voices, because that's when the show gets good.  Oh, God.  You know, I was laying down on my truck driver and shit, and these guys started putting that shit on.  I thought I was going to fucking have to go hang my head up the door and vomit.  Wow.  I'm playing that stupid last song.  It really was awful.  It was.  That Barry Manilow song took years off my life. 
[03:48:30]  That was awful, wasn't it?  Years.  Just horrid.  And I apologize to the audience, but sometimes you have to be subjected to the things that are this horrid.  Fucking painfully unfunny.  He's a jerk-off?  Why?  What'd he say?  Problem?  You got a realtor's number?  Why?  What'd he say?  He wants you out.  He wants me out?  You're getting evicted?  Yeah.  He wants you out?  Are you telling me I've got to leave my apartment, Norton? 
[03:49:00]  He doesn't take too kindly.  That jealous guarantee.  The Department of Environmental Protection and the Housing Preservation and Development was called to rectify this problem  when a radio personality that had sex in a church is so fast to call the government to protect him.  Stop.  Hey, this motherfucker.  Stop.  That's exactly what he said. 
[03:49:30]  It's a shithouse.  Quote verbatim.  So then what'd he say?  So he goes, I want his manager to call me right away.  He doesn't have a lease.  We're going to terminate this.  I don't need these headaches.  I don't take these times.  Do you know, even without a lease, you could stay there three fucking months.  That's right.  You know?  Now stay.  If I might just interject at this juncture, I have two words.  Milford Plaza.  Lovely.  Hey, fuck this guy.  Yeah, he's a douchebag.  Now you stay.  I told you.  He doesn't appreciate we calling the city before calling him. 
[03:50:00]  I said, you were called last night.  And I said, you were called this morning.  He goes, he called me 9 o'clock last night.  I don't work at 9 o'clock.  Do you work at 9 o'clock?  Work?  Owning a building and a job like you're fucking where you own a fucking place.  If the wall caves in and water comes in.  Nah.  I said, yes, I do.  I do work at 9 o'clock.  I work 24-7.  I'm available for whatever I need.  He goes, Lincoln freed the slaves a long time ago.  I worked on the farm.  Why does he bring up bad news like that?  There's already enough bad news with the water in his basement, for God's sake. 
[03:50:30]  This guy is typical.  Good one.  Typical Ira.  What an asshole.  Yeah.  That's what I've been dealing with.  And believe me, I was killing him with kindness.  I know you did.  I know.  He don't get a smoothie.  That's it.  That's right.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  And he's bringing him over.  Here's a smoothie.  Can he stay?  I want him out.  I want him out of this apartment.  Out.  Sal.  The white landlord.  Oh, yeah.  Sal. 
[03:51:00]  I know you, you slumlord.  Opie's going to be in the basement hooking up a pipe to the gas line.  Cut Opie's throat.  This man needs an apartment.  This man needs an apartment.  Jealous Garrity.  There you go.  That's what I've been doing.  Home a little early, eh, Garrity?  With the saloon burned down?  I told him about the water puddling in the front.  That sewer drain's got to be cleaned.  God. 
[03:51:30]  You know, he's sending Jose, his contractor, over.  You're being evicted.  Oh, great.  You know what?  How can you evict you?  They can't evict you.  They're evicting you because he's got fucking water.  Because you called the city?  You haven't even heard the whole story.  Listen to the replay today.  The first half hour is me explaining what happened last night.  Yeah.  Listen to the replay.  Did you lose anything, like record albums or carpeting or anything?  He doesn't have anything.  Carpeting?  Are you insane?  Wow.  He's got one table and one chair in the place.  There's three floating milk crates in the basement.  Wow.  In the past less than a month, two walls collapsed in the basement. 
[03:52:00]  No.  When I told him that, he goes, let's not be dramatic.  The walls didn't collapse.  Collapsing is 9-11.  I go, do you have to go there?  That's dramatic.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Yeah, he said, don't be dramatic, and then brings up 9-11?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy, it just sounds like an asshole.  He's the epitome of that, whatever that means.  Oh.  Well, you called the city?  Epitome.  Say it right.  You called the city, and so now they're on it?  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  Good.  So, fuck him.  And that's what happens, and he knows now.  He's fucked.  Because...  Keep at him.  Well, the...  He's been hiding problems with this building for many years, and I was being a nice guy  for a really long time.  I put up with a lot of bullshit.  Tell Lindsay not to let that fucking clean-up guy in there, because you want the people to  see it first, right?  She knows.  She knows.  She knows.  Did he spell apartment on the pad data with two Ps?  No.  Yeah.  Someone's calling him out.  Yes, he did.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus. 
[03:53:00]  You know what?  There you go.  Call the New York Post.  I'll do a fun little story for them.  Oh.  It's right up their alley.  Shame, shame, shame.  Have a picture of you outside the place, looking all dejected.  Exactly.  Obi thrown out.  Shock jock on the street.  I thought he said, look at all...  He's got two garbage bags full of his clothes.  No, that's money.  Well, he had a lot of nerve to bring up that a shock jock that had sex in a church  who's calling...  He's so quick to call the government to protect him.  I know, what does that have to do?  The church should stay in a separate. 
[03:53:30]  That's who he should call.  Dude, I sent him a...  The tenant, yeah.  What the fuck?  I sent him a really long email at the beginning of the week, all the problems with the place.  He's fucked and he knows it.  And, you know, Lindsay almost broke her neck over the weekend because the basement kind  of like seeped up some more water.  Nothing like what happened last night.  And she went flying because she didn't know the tile floor was wet.  You know how that could be.  Yep.  Smashed her knee really bad.  She could have broke her neck.  Sue everybody.  So I politely mentioned that he's going to have a real problem eventually because someone's 
[03:54:00]  going to get in there and break their neck.  And then what?  There's a real problem going on.  And I've been trying to tell him.  And, well, we'll play ball.  I'll be evicted.  I'll be a shock jock that's evicted.  He can't evict you.  And what you should do, get a hotel room and fucking sue him for the stay.  If the city's involved, believe me, they might tell you, they might condemn the apartment.  Chateau d'Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  I just had guests.  Dude, the fuck?  No, but why don't you stay with Anthony?  You guys can fucking practice the show at night. 
[03:54:30]  Thanks.  Yeah.  I'm just like a guest.  You know my door is always open to you, Opie.  Thanks.  If you want to stay at my house.  For me, too.  And Jimmy.  And any young lady we think, friends, I may bring home.  Absolutely.  Wherever you want, whatever you want, you can stay at my house.  Why don't we all stay at Anthony's house, and we can do dry runs at night on the radio show.  It'll be a sleepover.  We can practice bits.  A pal talk sleepover.  We're talking to rulers.  Pretend we're on the radio. 
[03:55:00]  At least, Opie, at least we have our first contestant for the homeless shopping spree next year, Greg Opie Hughes.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Wow, that landlord was pissed off.  Get out before I throw you out.  Believe me, I was nice as pie.  I was killing with kindness, and this guy is just a jerk.  Well, at least you don't use cliches.  Tippy Hughes.  Nice as pie.  Killing him with kindness.  Yeah.  Why don't you go shit your head?  Could you use your big eight-like fists next time instead of kindness? 
[03:55:30]  I killed him with kindness.  God didn't give you those mitts to be polite.  I got them with kindness.  He's an ass, too, because he responded to the email I sent yesterday, late last night.  Not even late last night.  It was around nine.  It was late for me because I had to go to bed.  And he responded to that email.  And in the email I sent, I said, I will be calling 311 in the morning.  So if he cared at all, he would have got back to me immediately.  He's a fucking douche.  And now you keep the pressure on.  Keep the pressure on.  Keep calling 311. 
[03:56:00]  Call all those Environmental Protection Agency people and everything else.  The fucking HUD.  I don't even know who that is.  Exactly.  What they do.  Housing and Urban Development.  Call NASA.  Tell them there's fucking aliens in the basement.  Get every agency possible.  And the papers.  Call the papers.  The papers.  Huh?  N-double-A-C-P.  Call them, yes.  Because they're out front.  That's right.  All right.  Unbelievable.  What a son of a bitch.  Can I ruin anything else for you today? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, really.  Well, no, you did what you had to do, Ken.  You can't help it.  You're just a bringer of cancerous news.  Thanks, Kenny.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ken, he's coming in with fun news.  I killed him with kindness.  I was nice as pie.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  Oh, and you have throat cancer.  The biopsy came in.  A burn in the hand is worth two in the bush.  Two in the bush.  You could lead a horse to water.

These guys down there in Texas, I have no idea.  Thank you.  You guys are at your back.  We love a good battle.  And we're going to hit it tomorrow on Terrestrial, too.  We're going to hit it both.  And, you know, obviously everything we do on Terrestrial is heard on XM,  so we're going to hit it tomorrow, too.  By the way, the population of Texas is 22.8 million.  So they have almost the entire population of Texas.  Of the state of Texas.  They have 75% of the state of Texas. 
[04:13:30]  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, they probably have about 80 million people calling the station, though,  this morning, man.  Some signal.  They're awesome.  Yeah, they're really getting smashed, and they know it.  Well, they must have gotten their head, those dirty boys up north.  Must have gotten their head.  Yeah, we got more listeners than they got old...  Yeah, we got more listeners than they got corn cobs on them.  Goddamn.  Well, we're just simple folk.  They had more listeners this morning than they ever did before.  Hell, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse from here.  Thanks, sir.  All right.  Godspeed.  Hell, I'd like you to come to my house and fuck my sister. 
[04:14:00]  What do we got for tomorrow?  War.  Well, we're going to be doing this.  And we should wire you for sound when you leave.  You should be wired for sound, my friend.  Yeah, give me some.  Give him a fucking recorder.  Give me some.  He says, I want to hear from the second you get to your house till tomorrow.  I want recorded.  That's right.  You wearing a wire?  Wearing a fucking wire?  Yeah, give me some.  That's what I want.  Yeah, and then you'll go in there and fucking eye roll, make you turn around in the seat. 
[04:14:30]  The landlord will give you a good frisking.  Hey, shock jock.  This guy's delusional, though, man.  How many chances did he want?  He can't evict you.  I don't give a shit if he does.  I would stay somewhere.  I don't give a shit if he does.  And sue him for the money for the hotel.  I'm leaving with my clothes and my person.  That's it.  What about your furniture?  Fuck that.  It's staying.  I mean, there's stuff I'm saying.  All cock and roach.  Cock and roach infested. 
[04:15:00]  Cock and roach.  Cock and roach is roaming around your apartment.  Fuck you smoking pot faggots.  Look, I haven't slept in a while.  Cock and roach infested furniture.  You ain't going to take anything, right?  No.  Leave it all in there.  The TV?  That thing ain't moving.  It weighs 500 pounds.  Leave the sofa.  Take a big shit.  Take the TV.  I got the last TV before flat screens became reasonable.  Take a shit inside the back of the TV.  I can't move that if I wanted to.  You can give the TV away.  You'll have someone take the TV out. 
[04:15:30]  We'll give it away to one of the stuff.  I'm telling you right now, it's impossible.  It is.  There's roaches in it, too.  Fuck.  What do you think?  They get everywhere.  Oh, you're right.  There's roaches in the television.  You wouldn't take that furniture to your new place?  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  Club Soda Kenny.  That should stay there.  That place has got to be bombed.  Update.  Update from Kenny.  Yes.  Turn that mic on, young fan.  Kenny, you know you work in OT today, right?  It's my pleasure.  All right.  Whenever my friends are in trouble, I rise to the occasion.  You're like a stupid hero. 
[04:16:00]  Puts his cape on over his face.  He falls asleep because he thinks it's night.  He's a bird with a mullet.  Bird brain.  For some reason, your landlord just called me back, and he changed his tune.  He was nice as pie.  Oh!  Did he kill you with kindness?  Nice as pie.  What did he say?  Sweet as punch.  He said that he contacted a company that's going to call me and set up the cleanup and  deodorizing.  And the JBL.  And the eventual repair of the problem. 
[04:16:30]  Looks like someone talked to their lawyer.  All right.  With a scoop of ice cream on the pie?  With a cherry on top.  Did he say, pretty, pretty, please?  You don't fold.  Yeah.  You don't fold.  And then...  This is bullshit.  Bargaining tactic.  The company just called me and advised me that they're rounding up a cleaning crew.  Oh, yeah.  Call me back, you know, to let me know when they're going to come over there.  You know what that cleaning crew will do.  I'm pleased you are...  Hey, shut up.  Oh, that's not my fault then. 
[04:17:00]  What happened?  It's never your fault.  I hit number one on bank one.  All right.  So things are happening.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Anyone have a digital camera?  I got some...  You know, I never take the cameras inside my pad, but I think I may have some pictures  for everybody.  Take E-Rock's 7.2 megapixel, and then after you upload the photos, break it.  Just throw his nice new camera in the water.  Watch it float.  I'll take some pictures of my pad.  Fucking your crib.  No furniture in the way to block the fucking view.  A little inside look.  I never thought I'd say that, but at this point, I have to. 
[04:17:30]  That's this one.  Watch.  You want to eat me?  Thank you, Kenny.  Why is it changing?  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  And this is...  Food, all right?  You'll get that straightened out eventually, I'm sure, Than.  That's no problem.  He also realized that I did a five-month extension only a couple months back.  Oops.  Oh, you did?  Checked his files and checked with his lawyer.  Oops. 
[04:18:00]  Don't fold.  I'm not folding.  How are you going to evict somebody for complaining to the city that there's fucking a hole in  sewage in their apartment?  Keep every threat of the city coming in on this guy.  Bam, bam, bam.  Bada bing, bada boom, bada bing.  You don't want him to fix things.  You want restitution.  You want out of there anyway, and you want money from him.  Fuck him.  He's been fucking you for a long time.  That's right.  You've had mice in there fucking for a long time.  You don't buy me out.  I buy you out.  Exactly.  Goddamn shock jocks really make me laugh.  I take all these mice in. 
[04:18:30]  Draw cockroaches for everybody in the room.  Draw sewage.  Everybody gets mold on the house.  The rats will kick your teeth out.  When are you going to clean up?  That's for you to find out.  Opal has to walk in.  He skips in.  Ba-da-da-da-da.  Tell the mice and the roaches, all right, get out of here.  Get out.  Come on, scram.  He doesn't like silage and flooding.  All right.  Things to do.  Otto, thanks.  Thank you, Opal. 
[04:19:00]  All right.  We'll see you soon.  MySpace, Otto, and George.  And laugh.com for his CDs, and we're going to try to get them on the O&A Traveling Virus  Tour.  How many CDs do you have out?  One or two?  I got a CD and a DVD for sale on that, laugh.com.  Okay.  I want a copy of the DVD.  I only have the CD.  You do?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't have the other one.  You don't?  Otto and George classic moments.  You're on that.  Goggily Go-Go, the Heaven 17.  Pitiable, portable picnic place. 
[04:19:30]  Can't stump me.  I just want to just jerk off all the Jesus statues film.  All right.  We're out of here.  Bye, guys.  We're done.  We'll see you out tomorrow.  Bye.  I love listening to Opie and Anthony when I'm having a tubby.  I get clean.  I laugh at the funny jokes.  And I play with my submarines.  Sometimes Uncle Henry gets in the tub with me.  He makes me play with his submarine.  I'm having a happy play. </pre>
