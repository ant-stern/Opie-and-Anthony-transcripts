<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious defense against a lawsuit filed by Sandy Cain, a former show performer, for damages related to a supposedly "viciously and horribly" smashed guitar and damaged hat.  Opie and Anthony vehemently denied Cain's claims, asserting they paid her for the guitar immediately and that she continued to appear on the show and even used photos with them for self-promotion afterward. They used highly offensive language to express their anger at her ingratitude and accused her of seeking publicity through the lawsuit.  This segment also included complaints from Opie about his insomnia, a faulty studio microphone, Anthony's weekend, and  Opie's dissatisfaction with his working conditions, including lack of raises, delayed projects (intern recruitment, studio lighting upgrades), and unreasonable management demands like unpaid participation in an NFL fantasy draft and a poorly planned beach party.  Opie hinted at renegotiating his contract or leaving the show. Sam Roberts was mentioned.

The show then delved into a graphic recounting of a past Opie and Anthony beach party, using explicit photos and videos (accessible via sexybuffalo.com/opieandanthony) as visual aids. The hosts detailed numerous acts of public nudity and sexual acts, highlighting the chaotic nature of the event, its proximity to families, the resulting influx of onlookers, and the "VIP area" providing elevated visibility for the women involved.  They described the difficulties in locating and playing older video footage due to outdated file formats, and expressed frustration with their employer’s lack of support regarding the potential repercussions of the event.  This segment also included a discussion of their careers, frustrations with their employer, and a comparison of their situation to a "Death Star."  Guests Mark Maron and Joe DeRosa were mentioned as being in studio later in the broadcast.  Maron’s successful podcast, "WTF," its financial success, and the challenges of the podcasting world were discussed, with Maron describing his podcast's evolution and interviews with figures like Jonathan Winters.

Comedians Mark Maron and Joe DeRosa joined the show.  The conversation shifted to Maron's career trajectory, his move away from politically-charged comedy, and his newfound contentment with his podcast as a primary outlet for self-expression. He discussed his past anger, his involvement with Air America and its potential negative impact on his career, and his jokingly described libertarian views as "teetering on anarchy."  The conversation covered aging, physical health (Maron’s limp, vitamins, protein powder), and past drug use (cocaine), with detailed anecdotes from Maron and DeRosa. The discussion also included the changing public perception of homosexuality (using Liberace as an example), the unsympathetic nature of social media reactions to celebrity deaths (Amy Winehouse), a failed Comedy Central TV pilot involving Maron and DeRosa, their current projects, and their music preferences (Chris Cornell, Soundgarden). A Soundgarden song was played.  Throughout this segment, the hosts and guests frequently used vulgar and offensive language.

Further discussion of drug use, specifically cocaine, continued, detailing anecdotes about drug acquisition and the consequences of substance abuse. This transitioned into a conversation about the pervasive nature of technology, its impact on modern life, the challenges of disconnecting, and the anxieties it creates.  A significant portion was dedicated to a discussion of comedian Gallagher, his controversial onstage material (allegations of racist and homophobic jokes), his abrupt ending of a podcast interview with Maron, and his career trajectory.  They also recounted a humorous but unsuccessful attempt to get Don Cheadle on the air after a chance encounter on a plane.  Mark Maron and Joe DeRosa remained in studio, discussing their upcoming shows and personal experiences, with Maron elaborating on his Gallagher interview and DeRosa discussing relationships and personal growth.  Numerous advertisements aired throughout this segment.

A caller, Joe, detailed his tumultuous relationship with his 28-year-old girlfriend, including a police intervention when she refused to leave his home.  He discussed the challenges of their age difference (he's 47), her desire for children, their contrasting tastes, moments of intimacy and frustration (including a humorous shower incident), his anxieties about commitment, past relationship failures, and emotional issues stemming from his adopted status and idealized views of romantic love.  He also discussed farting and defecating in front of each other and his crying fits. The hosts then shared their Comic-Con experiences and discussed a past Gallagher appearance, playing a contentious interview clip with Patrice O'Neal and addressing Gallagher's controversial statements on race.  Mentions of Don Cheadle and Mark Maron were made, and the show ended with plugs for Joe DeRosa’s comedy and other projects.

The final segment focused on a misunderstanding regarding interns "Pips" and "No Name" receiving time off from their supervisor, Mark Zito, after Zito's attendance at a Taylor Swift concert.  The resulting situation involved the interns arriving to an empty studio.  The discussion included details of their commute costs and "No Name's" plan to get drunk.  The hosts encouraged the interns to enjoy their unexpected day off.  Roland's antics (smearing french fry grease on Eric's desk) were confessed to on air.  A significant portion covered the upcoming staff stand-up comedy performance at the Hard Rock Cafe, discussing the participants’ preparation and apprehension, particularly Troy's reluctance.  The segment concluded with discussions about the comedy show, a potential pizza party, and a possible iPad 2 incentive.  The show also briefly mentioned Melissa Joan Hart's publicist refusing an appearance and unsuccessful attempts to get Sway on the show.

[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Morning.  Yeah.  But that would mean that somebody slept last night.  Oh, no.  Wee, wee, wee, fucking insomnia.  A little trouble snoozing?  Yeah, then I rolled over and tweeted, welcome, no, what did I say? 
[00:04:30]  I don't even remember.  Hi from, oh, yeah, hi from insomnia land.  Oh, shit.  And then everyone tweeted me back, try whiskey.  You should smoke pot.  Smoke a joint before you go to bed.  Try Xanax.  Drop a Xanny the Nanny.  You should whack off.  And then a bunch of other people that were in my exact boat.  They're just trying to help, Opie.  Just trying to help. 
[00:05:00]  I remember the clock hit.  12.15 was the last time I checked the fucking clock.  I was in bed at 9.30.  Nice.  Oh, wow.  I was in bed nice.  That's crazy.  First hour, slept, woke up out of nowhere, and then stayed up for like two or three hours.  I think that works.  And then I wandered around my apartment.  I drank the warm milk, like they say.  I checked the email, checked a little Twitter, went back to bed.  None of that shit worked.  What time was that when you went back to bed?  I don't know, like 12, like I said.  Maybe it did work, because then I saw 12.15, and then the last thing I remember, the alarm. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that's right.  It wasn't going off, because I woke up before five as well.  That just sucks, man.  And I know why.  We're getting older, where if you eat a little too late at night or exercise a little too late at night, for some reason, it fucks up your whole body.  What's that about?  Yeah, man.  Because it gets your metabolism going.  You got to shut that shit down.  By the way, the mics sound different again today.  Do they? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  I didn't notice.  Huh?  This mic sucks.  Now I'm in a bad mood.  Check one, two.  How long?  Huh?  15 minutes.  That's just a 15 minute.  Yeah.  Because it's just so common.  That one mic thing.  When Sam does the after show or whatever, and I'll either be at your mic or Jimmy's or that one, those mics sound great.  This mic sucks.  I've been saying it for years now.  That just sounds like shite.  It sounds very just tinny and flat. 
[00:06:30]  Thin.  Don't need that.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  I slept pretty well.  Although the hours were weird.  I think I woke up at like three in the afternoon yesterday.  Pulling an Amy Winehouse, sorry.  And I was back asleep.  Yeah.  I think she kept those hours.  She kept those weird hours.  Yeah.  Then I took another like four hour nap two hours after that.  Oh, wow.  But then I was up until about. 
[00:07:00]  That means you had a good Saturday night.  Two in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had a pretty good weekend.  It was fun.  I did Red Eye with DeRosa.  He was doing Andy Levy's part.  Nice.  And then we went out afterwards.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  We were out pretty late.  Uh-oh.  Pretty late.  Yeah.  DeRosa likes to drink.  No shit.  Uh-oh.  And then, yeah.  Saturday was just some drunken karaoke.  Some drunken compound karaoke.  That's always fun.  Yeah.  And Saturday was just chill. 
[00:07:30]  Chill.  Watch some TV.  Sleep late.  And then, um, slept, uh, actually woke, I was up until probably two, you know, two a.m.  Uh-huh.  And finally fell asleep and that old fucking alarm goes off.  Oof.  Just like a couple hours.  Uh, gray.  But I slept so much yesterday that.  That you were good?  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing yesterday either.  No beers or anything.  I'm like, what the fuck?  What's wrong with you?  I woke up like, wait.  What is this?  Fever, you all right?  I know.  I was like, what is this non-pain in my head? 
[00:08:00]  What happened?  Where's that throbbing pain when I wake up that I'm supposed to have?  I better go to the doctor.  I'm also in a slightly bad mood because Santa Cain is a complete ungrateful cunt.  Oh.  Her stupid little she'll never get a dime from me lawsuit made the newspaper today.  Yeah.  She's such a cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Twat.  A twat.  A complete twat that no one gave a shit about. 
[00:08:30]  Became a regular on our show, which was good for Sandy Cain's business.  Yeah.  Then out of nowhere, she decided, you know, if she does lawsuits, because she did the lawsuit  with the naked cowboy guy.  Cowboy.  That the press will pick up on it.  And of course, the press decided to pick up on this one as well.  Yeah.  Well, my statement, because supposedly the New York Post, which is filled with a bunch of  cunts.  They said they'd try to get a hold of us.  None of you assholes ever tried to get a hold of us. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Stop with the bullshit.  That's what newspapers do.  When there's something controversial, they make believe that they try to get a hold of  you.  There's no way to prove that they try to get a hold of you.  Yeah.  I'm telling you right the fuck now.  No one tried to get a hold of us.  Because they only want the crazy side of the story.  Yeah, of course.  Because it makes for better reading.  Yeah.  So they got their story that they want from the crazy side from Sandy Cain.  Right.  And we would only ruin the story by throwing in facts and stuff like that.  Right.  And they perish the thought there's any facts. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  So they say, yeah, numerous attempts to contact.  It's like, no, no one try to contact.  And like you said, with Twitter and everything, it's easy to get in touch with anyone these  days if you want to.  Let's see.  I got Facebook.  I got Twitter.  I got a YouTube email account.  I got an agent.  I got a regular email account.  We got people around here.  No one tried to get a hold of us.  So stop with that bullshit.  Yeah, that's crazy.  It's something the papers love to do and use. 
[00:10:00]  Because God forbid, if they did try to get a hold of us, maybe we would give them an  angle on it, which makes it not a good story.  Right.  It makes it like, oh, I can't.  Like Anne said, they just want the crazy part of the story.  Yeah.  But another fucking twat, cunt, piece of shit that we took care of.  And then they turn around and are just complete assholes.  Yeah.  Complete assholes.  What a biatch.  The fact is, this dumb guitar that I smashed, I paid her on spot for the stupid guitar that  was worth maybe $100. 
[00:10:30]  Not even.  Yeah, it was her personal property.  Yeah, I get all that.  But I smashed the guitar, and then I gave her a shitload of money.  A shitload.  That was like a $10 garage sale guitar.  It was a horrible guitar.  It was horrid.  And it made for great radio that day.  Yeah.  It was fun.  Everyone was laughing, and that meant that more people knew about Sandy Cain.  And then she lost her shit.  And as soon as I pulled out my wallet and started peeling off 20s, oh, did she calm down immediately.  This piece of shit.  And then I gave her her money. 
[00:11:00]  She was completely happy.  Did our show many times after that.  Turns out she never replaced a guitar.  She, to this day, uses it with a big gaping hole in it that she patched up.  And now she's suing us for $800.  Because she spent the money on something else?  What did you do?  She's suing us for more, but she's saying the guitar was $800.  It was an $800 guitar.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, she's suing for the max, whatever you're able to sue in small claims.  It's $5,000.  Yeah.  $5,000, something like that.  And then she's suing for the hat that you... 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, it says...  Where's the article?  A guitar that was smashed.  Smashed.  And they shot a hole in her hat.  Which made it sound like her dumb head was still in it.  Right.  Shot off.  Like, all of a sudden, you just fucking blast a shot off and she goes,  Hey, what'd you do?  Right.  There's a hole in her hat, smoking.  No.  No.  Sandy Kane suing open at the naked cowgirl lawsuit.  Because she knows these lawsuits could get her face in the news. 
[00:12:00]  They get publicity, whatever.  Even naked cowgirls get the blues.  Comedian Sandy Kane, who often performs in Times Square as the naked cowgirl,  is suing radio schlock jocks.  Did they say schlock jocks?  Yeah.  Oh, I read that as shock jock.  Schlock jocks.  Opie and Anthony for destroying her $800 guitar and shooting a hole through her cowboy hat. 
[00:12:30]  Shooting a hole through her cowboy hat.  And then she's like, I'm like an abused wife, said Kane.  An abused wife?  Get the fuck out of here.  Really?  Who the fuck would marry you?  Shut the fuck up.  I'm like an abused wife, said Kane, who has appeared on the Paris show numerous times.  I love them, but they're so vicious and horrible.  Oh, well, we are vicious and horrible, but...  Uh, vicious and horrible?  Let me tell you something about vicious and horrible.  She loved every fucking minute of it.  Of course.  Remember, after every appearance, her trying to take pictures of us. 
[00:13:00]  She couldn't get enough pictures of us.  Couldn't thank us enough.  Couldn't take our money fast enough every time we paid her.  How about I counter Sue for the fact that she uses our pictures to publicize herself in Times Square,  where she makes up flyers.  Oh, really?  And without permission, uses our images.  Now, that's a lot more than $5,000 right there, my friend.  Yeah.  Just another...  $5,001.  Just another ungrateful fucking piece of shit. 
[00:13:30]  Piece of shit.  You know, just add her to the list.  She has now filed suit against a duo in the SiriusXM Satellite Network in Manhattan Small Claims Court.  She is seeking unspecified damages for destruction of property, criminal mischief, and assault.  Assault.  What are you fucking talking about?  I never fucking touched the broad.  I didn't want to catch anything.  I know.  I literally have never...  I never fucking touched her.  I literally have never had any type of physical contact.  Not a handshake, not an arm around her while you take a picture kind of a thing. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  I'm always like, don't touch me, I hate being touched.  Right.  Brr.  And all the shit we did to her over the years, that was the only reason we had her on.  Of course.  There was no other reason to ever have this fucking cunt on our show.  I think her dick song is fucking great.  Do you think we want to hear that?  Kane said, Opie grabbed her guitar earlier this year and smashed it.  She also complained that the duo used her hat for target practice.  Reps for the show and Sirius did not return a call and email for comment. 
[00:14:30]  And that's complete bullshit.  They didn't try to get a hold of me.  But that's how they do these fucking things.  Pieces of shit.  Newspapers.  And we have a radio show, by the way, and we talked about this very topic.  Right.  So if you really wanted to find out what our side was, maybe tune in and find out.  Right.  The facts, yeah, I smashed one of her guitars.  Another fact, I paid her.  It was paid on the spot.  A lot of money on this fucking spot.  She was very happy.  Yes. 
[00:15:00]  Walked away with not a problem in the world.  Yes.  And then appeared on our show after that.  And I think when you took one of our hats that she left behind and brought it to the shooting range.  Yeah.  I think she appeared on the show after that as well.  Of course she did.  Of course she did.  She's a media whore.  That's why she's doing this shit.  It's completely stupid on her part.  Who the fuck is going to have her on their radio show?  I think Howard had her on once, but, you know, she's not going to be a regular over there. 
[00:15:30]  And what, like, what does she actually think she would get to play this out in a courtroom?  What is she going to get?  What was the total in the lawsuit?  Because I ripped up mine.  $5,000.  I ripped up mine.  Yeah.  Come find me.  I ripped it up.  $5,000.  And anybody would look and go, look, what did your used fucking felt hat cost?  So she's going to, so she, I mean, from her side, logically, she's willing to ruin a relationship 
[00:16:00]  with a radio show that's pretty damn popular for $5,000.  Is this the stupidest broad alive?  Yes.  The stupidest broad alive?  Yes, it is.  She is.  The stupidest broad alive.  Should we get Ron the lawyer on the phone?  Can we get Ron on later or soon if he's up?  I want to see what kind of merit.  There is no merit to this case whatsoever. 
[00:16:30]  Page seven.  The New York Post thinks it's such an important fucking story.  It has to be on page seven.  Schlock jocks.  Schlock jocks.  God, how fucking hack.  Isn't that...  How hack can you get?  Isn't that...  Oh, we're on the same page, by the way.  Yeah.  As the Oslo madman was loaded for terror.  That's where the paper decided this needed to be, in that same fucking area.  Very nice.  There's a plane crash in the Hamptons.  It's the Oslo fucking madman. 
[00:17:00]  And then our story.  And then...  All on the same fucking page.  Dumb Sandy.  Which means they really wanted this story to get a little attention, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  What a disaster she is.  Oh, my God.  There's Iraq smelling Sandy Canes.  Yeah, we got a million videos of her.  We did all sorts of fucked up shit to her, because that's all she was good for.  Yep.  And some people understand their place on this radio show.  We weren't having her in because of her music, quote, talent. 
[00:17:30]  Music.  Or because she is, quote, a comedian.  No, she'd always just babble too much.  Couldn't get a word in edgewise.  What a fucking dope.  What a fucking desperate dope.  Ugh.  You should fucking...  When I pass by her in Times Square, and she just looks like...  Her body looks like she was living on Jupiter for a month.  Everything is just fucking sagging, hanging. 
[00:18:00]  What a pig.  Right.  States her age at 51, too.  I think she said for this lawsuit...  Yeah, I don't remember what she said.  Ah, come on.  Not even close.  Oh, please.  I would bet she's pushing 70 at this point.  Yeah, gotta be.  I would bet.  Gotta be.  Better be careful, because she might sue us for getting her age wrong.  Yeah, look out.  I love these guys, but go fuck yourself. 
[00:18:30]  Done.  Using us to give a little publicity for yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  Done-ski.  Oh, God.  Watching her do a pole dance.  Rubbing her fucking whatever.  Ugh.  That disgusting fucking vaginal growth.  Ugh.  What a man.  Ha ha ha.  She really just does look like an awful man.  Ugh.  Anyway.  Slob.  So that set me off a little bit.  So that's another feature. 
[00:19:00]  Huh?  So that's another feature we have to deal with at some point.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  Another ungrateful fuck.  Talk to my lawyer.  What?  Why do I have to pay?  I ripped up my lawsuit.  I know, but if you don't...  That's what I think of her.  If you don't answer it, she wins by default.  I don't give a fuck.  Fucking write the check.  I don't give a fuck.  I ain't fucking doing...  I'm not appearing in small claims court over this fucking thing.  Sorry.  I'll send someone in my stead.  Sorry.  Yeah, there's me with the guitar way up in the fucking air. 
[00:19:30]  What?  We didn't put on this video me paying for the guitar, right?  Yeah, because that makes boring radio.  After the show, I fucking paid her out.  I have witnesses.  How much did we end up giving her?  $300, I think it was?  At least.  At least?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I mean, it's been a while.  I think it was at least $300.  And that guitar, like Ann said, this thing was the worst fucking guitar I ever had in my hands.  It was like a piece of cement. 
[00:20:00]  I almost broke my fucking wrist trying to break it.  I was going for, like, you know, a who thing.  Yeah.  And I hit this thing so hard on the ground, and the thing...  Look at it.  Yeah.  You could see me trying to break it.  Didn't even freaking crack it first.  And the face I'm making is like, oh, fuck, that hurt my wrist.  It was a really heavy, heavy fucking guitar.  What are you doing?  I've got it right.  Enough of her. 
[00:20:30]  Ripping off someone else's act.  Hmm?  With a naked cowboy.  Oh.  Like a cowgirl.  Wow.  How's she winning that suit?  Jesus.  I don't know.  She's allowed to stand there.  You're gorgeous.  Opie, I don't think you're a guy.  It's not bad at all.  Come on, Opie.  You got to run, too.  Come on, you're taking the fucking pictures of me.  Seriously?  No meeting.  Oh, you did it in the...  She was always chasing after me for another picture.  Come on. 
[00:21:00]  Come on.  Okay, one more picture.  There's eyes.  Come on.  One of those pictures.  One of those cameras from fucking...  She would get mad.  The 70s.  She would get mad if I didn't pose for a picture with her.  Every fucking time she was here.  And the reason was because then she would use these pictures to promote herself.  All right.  Take your picture.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, God.  I like how Kenny goes, come on.  We got to get to this meeting.  And Jimmy's behind going, there's no meeting.  There's no meeting.  There's no meeting.  Jimmy.  Jimmy just hung me out to dry.  That's great.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, Jimmy will be back tomorrow.  I see young Sam is back in his seat over there.  Yes.  The young Samuel is back from California.  The overpaid Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  The overpaid Sam Roberts.  Why are you saying that?  Huh?  She's in a bad mood.  Well, the trifecta of the bad mood is, and then I have to meet with one of the bosses 
[00:22:00]  today.  Just me.  Not me and Ann.  I'm not that guy anymore.  That sounds like trouble.  I'm not.  No, because I've done this for years where I meet for the show.  I don't want to meet for the show anymore.  But that was the old.  I wouldn't have had one of those meetings in a long ass time.  It's for the show.  Are you sure?  For the show.  For the show.  I will guarantee it's got to be something to do with just you, though.  No.  Because they always do meetings now where it's both of us.  No. 
[00:22:30]  I'm telling you.  I'll have a full update tomorrow.  This is the first time they're doing one of these meetings.  It'll be a meeting for the show, and then they will give me the whole laundry list of  stuff they still haven't accomplished.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  We're working on interns.  We're working on raises.  We're working on studio lights.  We're working on this.  We're working on that.  We're making progress on this.  We're making a little more progress on that.  Well, we kicked that one upstairs. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Exactly.  I don't want to meet with anybody.  I don't want to meet with anybody anymore.  I don't want to be here anymore.  Wow.  Not even supposed to be here today.  I can't make it more clear.  I might renegotiate soon, by the way.  I haven't told you that yet.  Renegotiate?  Meaning I need to renegotiate this thing or walk.  Mid-contract.  Yeah, because I've just about had it.  I don't want to meet with these people.  I'd like a mid-contract renegotiation.  That'd be cool.  Yeah.  Throw a little monkey wrench into the works. 
[00:23:30]  That'd be fun.  Or negotiate it out.  Say, hey, how about we just take this old contract and rip it up and start over?  Yeah.  And then maybe you could get happy employees.  Or maybe we just agree to fucking move on.  Agree to disagree.  Agree to move the fuck on.  Because I don't want to meet.  What's the list of things that are still on the table?  That's what it is, I think.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  I mean, the list that I've recorded your request is...  Look at it.  Look at his disclaimer.  Sam just fucking blurted out a disclaimer.  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, your list is making progress on interns.  When was the last time we had interns?  December.  That was December.  But didn't they say...  Seven to eight months ago.  Didn't they say at least two months ago they were making progress on that? 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  At least.  At least.  How is that making progress?  Well, there's so many different chains you have to go through.  Is it August right around the corner?  It's literally a week away.  So we haven't had interns in eight months.  A high-profile show for this company.  Wow.  Eight months would be...  Yes, correct.  But we're making progress.  Making progress.  Okay.  I think they look at it like, hey, what good are interns if they're able to do a show without  them?  It's been a good eight months.  We've proven that you could do a show without interns. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Raises for the interns?  No.  Oh.  Well, no one has had raises in quite a long time.  I don't know what that word is.  Including ourselves, by the way.  I thought, I swear to you, it's been so long.  When I glanced over there, I thought we were fighting for raisins.  I thought we wanted raisins in the studio every morning and they were saying no.  And I realized, now, raises?  I go, oh, okay.  Now I remember.  You forgot they gave them.  Yes.  Maybe OB is getting a raise. 
[00:25:30]  And that's what the meeting is about.  I know the staff hasn't had raises in at least three years.  I know we haven't had a raise in at least two to three years ourselves.  It's been a while.  Even though we bring more and more subscribers to this place every fucking day.  That's why I want to renegotiate.  That word's going to be thrown around a lot in the next month or two.  Ah.  Making progress on live events such as animation fest, softball game, et cetera.  Are we?  Making progress.  You know, we're working on a live event, whether it's an animation festival. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, we're doing one Thursday.  Right.  But we don't know what we're doing there.  We were just forced to do this thing.  We'll just go and...  And we'll, you know, it'll be good to see, you know, hardcore listeners and all that.  We'll yuck it up, as they say.  Yuck it up.  But there's no reason to do it.  No.  I mean, that's not a specific reason.  And they want us to do a beach party as well.  And I wrote them over the weekend.  I said, look, look, unless we have a plan, I'm not doing a dumb beach party.  Sorry.  We need real plans around here.  Like a beginning to end of it kind of walkthrough plan. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  And they want us to do a comedy show.  And I'm telling them right now, see, that was a little thing that me and Ant did.  That we were proud of.  That was great.  And we were able to put some pocket money in our pockets.  Now they want us to do that for free as well.  And I'm going to be on record and say I'm not doing that either.  The big comedy tour that we used to do.  We used to get a little taste of that.  That was great.  You're not going to do the comedy show?  Not for fucking free. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Everything's free.  Everything's free.  It goes in with the raisins.  Yeah.  Yeah, free raisins.  What else is on the list?  They're making progress on the online feed.  That's good.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I like clockwork.  I like clockwork.  I see the tweets.  Every day.  Every day.  It's forcing me to shut down my Twitter.  Yeah.  I can't deal with any more complaints about the online feed.  Yeah.  I can't do it anymore.  Yeah, so please just stop. 
[00:27:30]  Every fucking day.  So people just stop tweeting about it because we really can't do anything.  And we know it's there.  What's Gary's email address?  Because I'm not going to tell you.  He should get the people bitching and complaining because that's his job.  Tell him to set up an email just for the online complaint feed.  Wait.  The online feed complaints.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That line.  Why don't people tweet?  I'll give him one day.  If he doesn't set up a Gmail account for that, then his regular email goes out over the air tomorrow. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  Because I'm done with that, too.  I like the sound of that.  I'm giving him a chance, at least.  You are.  The old days, we would have gave out emails by now.  You're like the...  Because I don't want to spend my afternoons, especially, because it seems to happen during  the replay, of my Twitter going nuts with people that are fucking furious over the  online feed, bitching and complaining, saying, I'm paying for this shit.  Yeah.  That's what they say.  Well, why don't they tweet when it does work and talk about what a good time they're having  listening?  Obi's dropping warning pamphlets before the big carpet bombing. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  It's like, leave the city.  Yes.  We're going to do some carpet bombing.  So what you're doing is letting them know, set this Gmail account up.  Right.  24 hours.  Right.  Or else it's your account.  Also, I'm not doing the NFL fantasy draft this Thursday.  You're not going to do that?  No, because that's four hours of my time I'm not getting paid for.  Four hours?  So tell them I'm not doing that.  I know they've been promoting that, but I'm not doing that either.  You refuse.  Of course I do.  Okay.  When they came to me, I thought it was a little quick little thing. 
[00:29:00]  Four fucking hours.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Okay.  See, now I bet.  Make sure they know that too.  When did, when did you?  Oh.  And I kept putting it off, putting it off.  So now I got to do it today.  Because I bet this football thing's going to be part of that.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not doing it.  You're not going to?  I'll walk.  Oh, boy.  I'll fucking walk.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  So they'll have to find a replacement for that.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Okay.  Also making progress on studio lighting.  The lighting that you asked for.  I saw an email that, I don't know, something. 
[00:29:30]  Didn't we just want kind of like gels on these or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like to tone them down a little bit.  But then I guess they.  Track lighting.  I guess they sort of made progress on it.  But then there was another delay.  I remember reading something like that.  I read like the first sentence.  I went, okay, more of the same bullshit.  So does that stay on the progress list or not?  Because this is your list.  I'm just reading.  Do we see studio lighting?  I mean, it's not dark.  Is it the same studio lighting we had?  Yeah.  That we wanted changed out months and months ago?  Yeah.  Okay.  It stays on the list, of course.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  This was, I don't know if he'll appreciate me bringing it up, but Pro Tools.  Pro Tools for Troy.  Is that any progress?  I'll remember that.  Yeah.  And why does, why does Troy need Pro Tools?  To work.  To do, you know, production.  Anything creative.  Anything besides answering the phones.  Okay.  Which.  Are they making progress on that?  Yeah.  I mean, as far as I know, they are.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Eric just said into my headphones that he spent two years.  But again, that's Eric Nagel. 
[00:30:30]  But it's, it's being worked on.  Oh, and Troy Henson just said two and a half, actually.  Oh, two and a half years.  Two and a half years.  He's been asking for a simple thing called Pro Tools.  And that's what he said.  I don't know this.  Isn't that an easy one to do?  I'm just a messenger.  What could possibly be the problem with that?  You'd have to ask.  Oh, and by the way, Gary, do not.  Oh, boy.  Do not be waiting for me outside this fucking studio today.  What if he wants to solve?  Do fucking not.  What if he wants to solve some of the problems?  Oh, God.  Do not be waiting for me outside the studio. 
[00:31:00]  That is a massive warning.  Trust me on that.  Just know it's going to be.  Do not do it to yourself.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, you know it's going to be out.  Do not.  Right out there.  Just kind of stand there.  I can't wait to be podcasting.  Oh, my God.  That's a horrible thing to say.  I can't fucking wait.  And your meeting's today, you said.  These guys are throwing podcasts up left and right and doing really well.  Does it make you envious? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, because, well, yeah.  Go ahead.  What else?  Oh, and the final thing on the list, which is actually just added, which is a Gmail account for fan complaints.  Right.  Right.  And that's the progress list that I've been given.  I mean, if you want me to add to it, I will.  All right.  Now that you're back from San Diego, are you going to march down and request your raise again?  Because you're supposed to do that once a week.  Again, I mean, it's a weekly thing.  It's a weekly thing.  Lines of communications have been open in ways that they weren't before.  I've corrected some of my mistakes. 
[00:32:00]  I love how they made it.  Wow.  I love how they made it your mistake.  Yeah.  You weren't asking enough, was it?  Yeah.  We're asking you, so you're allowed to say it on the air.  It was suggested to me that maybe the best chance of results would be to change my strategy.  Change your strategy.  Yeah.  And ask every week.  They'd like more frequent private conversations as opposed to something that's so public.  Some public conversation.  Yeah.  Which I accepted. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, I mean, not everybody wants everything out in the public.  Well, of course.  Just, you know, just because I hear you, you know.  Yeah.  Because it doesn't make good radio.  I mean, I wouldn't say it doesn't make good radio.  They don't want it on public because it makes them look like idiots.  Again, I don't know what they just.  But, I mean, people out there could completely relate to that where, you know, you're obviously underpaid.  And then you go to your boss for a raise, like a proper raise, not even like, you're not even holding them up.  And they turn it on you and make it your problem that you aren't asking properly. 
[00:33:00]  I didn't say it was a problem.  I just said new strategies have been enacted.  That's our observation or my observation.  New lines of communications are open.  Communication.  And everything is, everything has a much more positive feel to it than it did before.  Uh-huh.  Right.  And, by the way, the reason why.  Which is important.  Just so they know down the hall because they're really stupid and dumb.  I don't know that.  They really are.  We can't just do a willy-nilly beach party. 
[00:33:30]  What I love to hang with the listeners, absolutely.  Yeah.  But the last time we had a willy-nilly beach party, a lot of people got arrested.  Right.  We had to flee fucking Buffalo before we got arrested.  And they were looking to arrest us, come down to New York City and arrest me and Ant.  But then what happened was we did the St. Pat's thing, which took precedent.  Yeah.  And then the Buffalo people said, oh, they're in a world of fucking hell.  We don't need to fucking pursue this anymore.  They're fucked.  So what you're saying is this is not that show. 
[00:34:00]  I don't feel like I want to do that again.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if we don't have a plan, that means all of a sudden, if there's vegetables around,  we are going to ask girls to shove it up their pussies.  And their assholes.  It'll happen.  Yes.  Can't help yourselves.  And I wrote that email over the weekend, and none of them write me back.  And I think they want that to go down in two weeks.  A beach party in two weeks with absolutely no fucking plan.  Where you're expected not to have girls shoving vegetables in their orifices. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  That doesn't make sense.  Because remember, we showed up in Buffalo, and we're like, oh, fuck.  And they're like, hey, man.  And we're like, huh.  It's like, oh, well, we got strippers.  Right.  And we got a volleyball net.  Right.  So, you know, we'll just do some stripper volleyball.  We'll drink with the things.  And we're like, yeah, that's cool.  After a few beers, I saw things I have not seen until then.  And have not seen since then.  Right.  Happen anywhere.  See, it was a radio station we used to be on.  So they gave us ahead of time, like Ann said, local strippers that were up all night before they showed up. 
[00:35:00]  And a volleyball net.  Of course they were up all night.  That was it.  And they said, the rest is up to you guys.  It's whatever you guys want to do.  Have fun.  Right.  We're like, oh, okay.  Hey, anybody got a zucchini?  Right.  The things they almost got us on that day.  In a way, thank God we had the St. Pat's thing.  It sort of saved us from criminal charge.  The horrified faces of mothers and families and their children. 
[00:35:30]  As two strippers are lezzing out in the sand instead of playing volleyball.  Because guess what?  Oh, God.  I guess the strippers found the volleyball very, very monotonous after the first minute.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was much better.  Is that an actual picture?  Yeah, that's from your last.  That's from our last beach party, you idiots.  That's why I'm not going into this without a plan.  And that's why you need to at least acknowledge that I wrote you over the weekend. 
[00:36:00]  How could a girl spread her legs so far apart?  We're looking at a girl that's completely naked.  It's her vagina.  And a bunch of guys that are obviously strangers are holding her up and pulling her legs apart  so she could show her pussy to the world.  The inside of it.  Whoever gets the bigger half makes a wish.  Right.  Yeah, because it looks like they're just pulling her apart.  Oh, by the way, no complaints.  I would love to do this type of party again.  Oh, who wouldn't?  But you know you have no one that will support you in the end.  No, no.  So we're the ones that have to take the rap.  What is that one now? 
[00:36:30]  There's a girl laying on the beach.  Yeah.  Her feet are...  She's naked.  Her feet are behind her head, and I believe something is about to be inserted inside of  her.  There's two other strippers, naked.  I don't know what's happening in that photo.  I can't even tell you.  Yeah, let's see another one.  Oh.  Well, there's...  There seems to be lesbian sex.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  Look at how many of these girls are just nude, humping each other. 
[00:37:00]  They paired off.  Yeah.  Was this a private beach?  No.  No.  Open to the public that day.  No.  It was one of those bar beaches.  Oh, wow.  And then, like, if you were a part of the public that weren't at that actual bar, you could  just walk the beach right past the bar.  That type of place.  Yeah.  20 yards away from that, I would say, were blankets with families on them.  Having lunch and swimming in the water.  Yeah.  Just enjoying a day at the beach.  Right.  Building sandcastles.  Oh, sandcastles.  Vegetables, all the things you do at the beach. 
[00:37:30]  It's a pail and shovel.  What else?  Lesbian sex.  Lesbian sex.  Vegetables being shoved inside.  Why don't we have the vegetable pictures?  I don't know.  Maybe the vegetable council got to...  What were the pictures that are now X'd out, is what I need to know.  I would love to know.  Those are probably the vegetable pictures.  Big Opie and Anthony logo.  Oh, yeah.  Perfect.  That's nice.  I'm not saying we didn't have a great time.  It was one of the best times I ever had in my life.  That woman is wearing nothing but credentials.  She's taken like a backstage pass credential you wear around your neck and put it around 
[00:38:00]  her waist and the little credential part is just flopping around in front of her vagina.  I thought she attached it to her clit piercing.  She may have.  I don't know.  You can still see her vagina.  And every shot...  And look at the volleyball.  The volleyball is just by itself on the sand.  It hasn't moved in hours.  Right.  Every shot, there's smiling guys clapping and drinking.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, no.  Come on.  What is that one for?  Now, describe that picture. 
[00:38:30]  There is a woman with a giant pussy vulva.  And she's either really fucked up or in the middle of an orgasm.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know which one is the case here.  She's sitting on...  What is she sitting on?  Some kind of railing, it looks like.  A railing with the...  What's this?  I don't know.  Something looks like it's in her ass.  I think maybe she's having sex with the railing.  Yeah.  That could be.  And then she's got her arm on a guy, I think, around his waist.  Or penis. 
[00:39:00]  Or penis or something.  What the hell is with these pictures?  By the way, Pro Tools 9, full version, is $600.  Troy's been waiting for a $600 machine for two and a half years.  There's a whole bunch of complications going on with it.  There's another picture of the girl who's taking the fence post in the ass, and now a guy has decided to try to fist her.  He's putting something green up her pussy.  Yeah, there's something green there.  I can't see the green there.  It's some sort of dildo or cucumber. 
[00:39:30]  It could be a cucumber.  And I pretty much know for certain that they didn't know each other going into this.  No, no, no.  This is not a husband and wife team.  This is one of our lucky listeners.  We're like, yeah, why not?  Come stick something in her.  Come stick something in the girl.  What is this?  I don't want to give the site out because it'll probably crash.  We'll give it out at the end of this discussion.  Yeah.  All right, what else?  This is from the last beach party.  Did they do their research? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, how about you research and look at this?  And the email I sent this weekend wasn't because I was in a bad mood or anything.  I started thinking, I don't want to get in this situation again because I know this company  will not support us if any of this shit goes down.  So if we don't have a real reason to do a beach party, we can't do it because this is  what will happen no matter what we say.  They're all naked.  They're all naked riding the rail.  Just riding on the rail.  Just humping a railing.  And was there body paint that day? 
[00:40:30]  Because I see some girls wearing nothing but paint.  No, that's the paint that rubbed off the stuff they were rubbing on.  Like, look, see that chick?  What is that on her?  Maybe.  She's just wearing like a smattering of blue and pink paint.  Maybe we did Boobard or something.  I don't know.  Oh, we might have done that.  Who knows?  Boobard.  Who the fuck knows?  There's little kids from Buffalo running around the beach 20 yards away.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  This is like nine years ago.  Oh, this had...  Nine years ago this summer. 
[00:41:00]  There was no security at this event.  It was just...  You didn't have...  No, it was...  Nude women and drunk men.  There was no one telling us, don't do this.  You weren't around then.  No, I wasn't.  We were going to get fired for this and arrested.  Do you understand?  And then a mere two weeks later, we did the St. Pat's thing.  Yeah, let me make this perfectly...  There were warrants out for our arrest at the time.  I do remember that.  And the people around us were warning us that it's coming at any moment. 
[00:41:30]  I really want to make this very, very clear.  Please do.  What you're looking at looks amazing and fun and cool.  It is completely illegal.  Yeah.  It's against the law.  You cannot have completely nude lesbian girls on a beach, public beach, shoving shit in their vaginas.  Well, you're not even supposed to have nude people on the beach.  Let alone people performing sex acts on each other.  Live sex acts on the beach in front of families. 
[00:42:00]  I would assume there would have been a sodomy charge.  Yes.  Yes, at the very least.  Oh, yeah.  We would have been inciting fucking some kind of sexual rioting.  You know how we squashed this coverage down?  The local news was starting to do massive stories on this.  How did you squash it?  By having a couple have sex, allegedly, because to this day, I really don't know if they did.  Yeah.  In St. Pat's.  In St. Pat's.  So you guys were actually...  Well, then the Buffalo news station's like, fuck, we got to go with the possible sex in a church story. 
[00:42:30]  They did use the local angle when they tied it in.  They said this was, of course, the same duo that was on the beach and, you know, did this with vegetables.  Let me see more of these pictures.  I haven't seen these in a while.  There used to be videos of this shit, too.  Yeah.  You guys were lucky that you got fired because otherwise you would have gotten fired and arrested.  Yeah.  Wait, go start from the beginning again.  Okay.  And just go through every picture really fast.  You want to see how it...  Because I can't...  The thumbnails.  Look how it progresses.  There's a volleyball net and there's girls with... 
[00:43:00]  Look at those girls with shirts on.  They're scantily clad.  Yeah, but they are clad.  This looks like how the beach party that we'd be doing would start.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I'm trying to tell these guys.  You could say I'm just in a bad mood being an asshole and that's fine if you want to go with that route,  but I'm also...  I'm throwing some major fucking logic at you.  Wow.  Okay.  Next picture is...  All right.  Now the girls...  They're wearing thongs and...  Showing their asses a little bit.  Sure.  They kind of painted stuff on their butt cheeks, but they're wearing thongs. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Everything's still on the up and up.  Okay.  Well, there's a girl completely naked.  Three photos in.  Three photos in.  She's completely naked.  I think she was the one that started it because the rest of the girls still sort of have clothes on.  And the volleyball court, as it were, the part of the beach that they've roped off, is still cleared as a volleyball court.  It hasn't yet been overrun by male fans shoving shit inside girls' vaginas on a public beach.  So you're not allowed to incite an orgy on a public beach? 
[00:44:00]  I don't think you can.  Okay.  I don't think you can be the ones that organize a live sex orgy on a public beach.  The only defense I have is these girls were loose and willing, by the way.  Loosey-goosey.  You gotta love them Buffalo girls.  They went with it big time.  You talked about families on the beach.  Tell me what time of day was this.  Oh, wow.  This might have been...  Two in the afternoon.  Two in the afternoon.  Hot day.  Wow.  Beach.  On what time of the year?  Summer. 
[00:44:30]  So the kids were out of school.  Oh, out of school.  Loving it.  And she's...  Now naked girl is talking to another one of the strippers.  And going, how do my tits look?  That's how...  I think I'm reading her lips.  But if you look behind, one is on her knees behind another who's on all fours.  Yes.  Oh, I see that.  Okay, yes.  Starting debauchery.  Yeah, and I think she's telling the girl, hey, why don't you take your clothes off?  Right.  Like, that's the chat.  Right.  That's going on right there.  And you guys were saying, what, leave them on or...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly.  We were just screaming, no, leave them on. 
[00:45:00]  Do you know, like, here's our contribution.  Hey, guys, you want to see some pussies?  Yeah!  Hey, welcome to TNA with ONA.  Let me tell you something, guys.  We are going to see some fucking assholes get shit shoved in it.  What do you say, motherfucker?  Yeah!  And there's a mom down the beach with some bologna sandwiches going,  did I just hear motherfuckers and shoved shit in their assholes?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  This is the beach.  What happened?  You know how bad this non-broadcaster was?  They had a local DJ that was sort of broadcasting live, but we didn't have to broadcast live.  No.  And he kind of interviewed us a little bit, but they didn't want to stop the music because it's the weekend.  And you got to play that music for everybody out there.  It's all about the music.  Right.  The FCC wanted to fine us even though it wasn't a broadcast.  That's how bad this was.  There were complaints into the FCC about this and it never aired. 
[00:46:00]  The federal communications.  There's no communications.  There's nothing going on in their jurisdiction.  But the FCC took it seriously and we're trying to find in their books something that we, some kind of law we broke.  They heard what happened and were horrified because they thought all of it went out over the air.  They're trying to see if they could fire the DJ who just happened to be there?  Yeah, yeah, probably.  Yeah, but nothing really went on the air.  But nothing went on the air about that.  Oh, now the girls just feeling each other up.  Now she's feeling, they're feeling tits.  I thought they were supposed to be playing volleyball.  Well, there's, is that one girl wearing a thong or anything right there? 
[00:46:30]  No, she's completely naked.  There's nothing going on there.  Bottomless.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sunglasses.  That's nice.  Good, good.  You've got to protect your eyes.  I think she knows.  Now, now we've got.  Now we've got one, two, three girls.  Three girls.  No, four.  The one in the background, too.  Yeah.  And then that girl's walking toward the sidelines to throw her clothes down somewhere.  To throw her clothes out, yeah, yeah.  Where she can find them later.  Okay, continue.  This was on a public beach, yes. 
[00:47:00]  Good luck.  Where were we?  Yeah, right.  Where were we?  I know exactly.  No, we did that one.  Yeah.  Right there.  Yeah, we saw that one.  Yeah, the girl with the.  Her ankles are literally behind her ears.  Oh, that picture is so outrageous that it's blurry.  Because whoever took this picture was like, holy shit, I can't believe I'm seeing this.  There is someone being straddled by two naked women, straddled on the penis and straddled  on the face. 
[00:47:30]  Was this the last time you guys did it?  No, no, it's three girls in it.  Is that a girl?  I thought it was a fun listener.  No, it's blurry.  So the one girl is sitting on her face and the other girl is grinding her vagina into  her vagina.  And if you look to the right, Opie, you'll also see a girl standing up and another girl  doing a handstand in front of the girl standing up with her legs spread and the girl is licking  her pussy as she is doing the handstand.  And if you've noticed, the perimeter of the volleyball court is starting to slowly move 
[00:48:00]  in.  It's more like a circle of fucking accomplices.  I think our listeners at this point are a little confused, like, wait, are we going  to still play volleyball?  They're not really sure.  I had money on this game.  At your last beach party, you had women performing oral sex nude on each other.  Yes, complete nudity and oral sex on a public beach.  And I see that, is there a tent somewhere outside of the frame? 
[00:48:30]  In every guy's pants.  Okay, just there.  But none that would have afforded any privacy.  Okay, continue.  Wait, are we up to that point?  Yeah.  All right, girl, just a blur.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, keep going.  Just a topless girl.  At this point, just a topless girl.  That's one of my favorites.  The girl with her legs spread further apart than any girl I've ever seen.  Are those listeners getting to hold her up in the air?  Oh, who would they be?  The guy thinks that we're so cool that he just won a naked girl to bring home.  Because he probably did.  Because he's carrying her like, holy shit, this is what I won today. 
[00:49:00]  And he's trying to go to his car and we had to stop him.  Little does he know he won chlamydia.  Right.  Because that looks a little skanky.  And it appears in one of his hands he's actually holding her bikini bottoms.  He's got the bottoms in his hand.  He is a gentleman's hand.  Yeah, yeah.  He's making sure no sand gets in there.  Sure.  And another guy next to him looks like, when's my turn?  Right.  Like, they're just going to pass her around.  Do we all get a nude woman?  They all get a nude woman to hold like that. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  It's fucking ridiculous.  It's just the big orgy.  This is actually an orgy taking place on the beach.  That's the big orgy going on.  And you notice the one guy with two beers in his right hand.  And he's debating what he's going to do next.  Wearing Mardi Gras beads around his neck.  Yeah.  And this was on like a Saturday afternoon?  Yeah.  Okay.  This was just.  I honestly think it started around noon or one.  Oh, my God.  And it was all day.  People could have just been having lunch.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  It's amazing.  More shots from above as girls are pairing off in the middle of the volleyball court.  Yeah.  Volleyball court.  That just says it all right there.  I don't know what's going on in the background.  There's literally one, two, three, four pairs of naked women going at it in all sorts of different ways.  Look at her technique.  She's on her knees and she's giving like.  Remember the China punch where she would fucking hit your groin?  That's what it looks like she's doing.  But she's actually fingering the girl standing in front of her. 
[00:50:30]  You see that?  I see that.  It's beautiful.  And this girl's eating that girl's ass out.  She's eating her ass out.  She's eating her ass.  Those two girls are just grinding vaginas on the beach.  And what the fuck is the one in the back?  I can't even see what's going on there.  I can't see.  It's a mess of hair and legs.  And then the one girl with her arms folded like, what the fuck?  Who am I going to have sex with?  The ass eating is great.  I could be mistaken, but it looks like they may be scissoring a little bit. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  Oh, some scissoring.  Yeah.  I thought that girl was eating that girl's pussy like that, but no, she is firmly entrenched  in her ass.  Oh, yeah.  She's got her ass in the air.  Gaping mouthfuls of that other girl's asshole.  Do you know for sure whether or not this beach had an insertion rule?  Oh, I bet.  I bet.  There's more pics from the sidelines.  Yes.  You know, at this point, everyone in Buffalo swears they're at this thing.  This thing is so legendary. 
[00:51:30]  We haven't talked about it in a while.  A girl with just massive boobs naked.  It is like a Woodstock vibe.  People.  What is she doing?  She's shoving something in her, and she can't get her legs far enough apart.  Her legs are completely spread as she's on her back, and I guess she's trying to, yeah,  shove something up her.  You know what I do like?  That picture is overexposed, unfortunately.  It is overexposed.  We've got to run that through Photoshop, take the levels down.  You know what I like about every picture?  The volleyball seems to show up in every shot.  Just laying on the ground. 
[00:52:00]  Look, there it is.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Right next to the girl shoving something in her vagina on the public beach.  Oh, wow.  It's just endless.  This guy's giving a woo!  Are these two guys right here security?  They're just kind of looking around like, what are we supposed to do now?  They might be guys from the bar, but they're just getting a closer view.  By the way, this bar never sold more beer than they did that day.  Yes, they told us it was legendary.  And they were kissing our ass, like, holy shit. 
[00:52:30]  We're at this point just serving warm beer.  I think they had to go and find beer.  They had to go out and get beer.  And then in the press, that's why I fucking hate all these fucks.  Oh, I hope you didn't tell us that this was going on.  You know, now we're like the scourge of society.  But when it was all going down, they had no problem with it.  I like how the volleyball perimeter in that picture, it's now completely round.  It's a circle that is slowly, slowly coming in toward the talent.  As I like to call the girls, the talent. 
[00:53:00]  Keep going.  Yeah.  Nice.  More girls just licking, socking, fucking.  We're going to give out the website in a second, by the way, so don't worry.  Oh, look at this.  That's a 69 position.  Yeah, there's a 69 going on right there.  Is that from another angle, or is that another 69 pairing?  That's another pairing.  That's not a separate angle.  Nice.  Because the same guy is in all the pictures.  All right.  You know, if this would have happened like...  Keep going.  You can go faster now.  Could you imagine if this happened like more recently?  Because I see some real old school cameras there and stuff. 
[00:53:30]  There would have been just graphic HD video of all this.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Because like I said, this is nine years ago?  Nine years ago, yeah.  Yeah, so there's a lot of regular cameras and digital cams, but...  What is going on there?  I'm a little confused by that.  Three to four girls.  Women, yeah.  Three to four women in some kind of...  They're piled on top of each other.  Wow.  All right.  And another guy is like toasting his friend there for being there.  Their security.  Their security. 
[00:54:00]  One security guy.  Security is right up front, too, just watching the girls go at it.  He wants a good look at the whole...  And there's a...  There's...  That's a great picture, Sam, because that shows you the public beach.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  There's not much going on there, but now you can see...  Oh, wow.  Like people pull up their family boats.  Yes, there were...  Oh, I forgot about the boats!  They would pull their family boats up to the shoreline because this part of Buffalo is happening.  There's a bunch of things you could do.  And they jump off their boat or hang out on their boat for the afternoon. 
[00:54:30]  But do you remember what happened?  Like the boats are all hanging out.  When the girls started getting naked and eating each other's assholes...  Right.  ...on a public beach...  Right.  The boats, like an armada, remember that?  They all moved over to the one area right in front of the bar.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I forgot about that one.  Okay.  But you could see there's, like, families and stuff in the background.  Yeah, there's beach chairs set up.  Yeah, that has nothing to do with us.  That has nothing to do with us.  How close was the...  We were seeing beach chairs, families, boats.  How close was that to the orgies that you were having? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, it's right there.  No joke?  Less than 100 feet.  Oh, my God.  No joke.  Yeah.  There's the VIP area.  The VIP area.  What the fuck is the VIP area?  That's where we got to stand so we wouldn't have to deal with the riffraff.  And the girls are up there now, though.  Were our chicks there that day?  I do believe...  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember.  We had...  Wait a minute.  We had come from somewhere the night before this, too. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, we...  We were somewhere else.  Yeah, we...  We were, like, a dual...  We had to take a plane.  Yeah, we were doing some kind of tour.  I forget.  I don't remember.  I don't remember what we did the day before.  I'll say the problem with the VIP area, too, is that it's raised.  So, uh, this woman who's got her legs spread on the railing is above everyone.  Yeah.  So, even the people who couldn't see the orgy because of all the guys around them in the  public part of the beach...  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's what we decided.  Well, fuck, if this is going on, we got to get the girls higher up, which means more  people on the public beach could have taken a look. 
[00:56:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  You're absolutely right.  Right.  Guilty as charged, sir.  And then the ex-pictures, those are the really bad ones.  That's why those pictures are exed out in the thumbnails.  Jesus.  Because I don't see any of the really bad ones that I used to see from this event.  Like the one with the, uh...  Was it a zucchini?  It was a zucchini.  The zucchini was the showstopper.  Yeah.  Quite literally.  Yeah, I think that was finally it.  That was the big one.  Oh, look, the girls are just hanging, chatting, just chit-chatting. 
[00:56:30]  That guy's just licking one of the girls' legs.  And this guy's camcorder is aimed directly at her vagina.  Where's that footage?  That guy has enjoyed that footage for the last nine years.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  He's like a foot away from her vagina.  He's got some good shit right there.  All right, continue, Sam.  Sam.  Come on, Sam.  We did that picture.  We saw that one.  There's some insertion.  Ah, there's this insertion.  Now a lucky listener gets to just fucking poke at her vagina with things. 
[00:57:00]  A lucky listener.  It's just sticking something inside her vagina.  Oh, yeah.  There she is getting off and grabbing some guy's balls.  Yeah.  Another lucky listener.  Ah, there you go.  Oh, okay.  Now she's got the fence.  This picture, she's got the fence post in her ass and some kind of green device in her vagina.  Number one, look at all the hands that are touching her.  I was just going to say, how many men hands does it take to spread her legs apart?  And number two, look down here in the corner at this guy's disposable camera right in her vagina.  We sold a lot of disposable cameras that day. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, I'm sure CVS loved developing those.  Probably a lot of those fucking pictures have never been developed.  There she is.  The fence post in her ass and a green thing in her pussy.  But look at the help she's getting from everybody.  Isn't that nice?  That is nice.  People do come around to help when they see somebody that needs a hand.  A real sense of community.  Yeah, a real sense of community.  Who's that laughing?  I don't know.  Everybody's having a good time.  And finally, the last page.  God. 
[00:58:00]  This is only one website, by the way.  There used to be a lot more pictures online.  I really think the authorities got involved because those X's, those pictures were removed.  I, uh...  You go fast now.  It's just a lot of girls on railing.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong there?  Oh, Mike, that's a bottle of water?  No, I don't think it's water.  It looks like some kind of hard lemonade.  Oh, it's like a Mike's hard lemonade, I think, bottle.  That she's shoving up her pussy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that's what the kids needed to see that day. 
[00:58:30]  Like I said, I'm not complaining.  And she's on the railing.  So, like you said, she's up high.  She's as high as somebody could be at that bar.  Anybody going to the beach would see a woman, completely nude, shoving a bottle of alcohol  up her vagina.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  She's a good two feet above everyone's head on the beach.  Yeah.  So, anyone behind can see.  You know, you want a good view.  Sure.  You don't want an obstructed view of a woman shoving a fucking Zima bottle up her pussy.  Or like a family coming in on their boat.  As they come in, they see a crowd. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, what's going on on the beach today?  What's going on there?  Is that...  Oh.  Oh, it's a woman.  Oh, I see.  It's a woman shoving a fucking bottle up her pussy.  Yeah.  Where are we?  Who's on mic there?  I don't know.  Have you noticed something?  What?  Not one shot us in any of these pictures.  No, because we're not stupid.  I know.  Any other shots?  I was just thinking.  It's like, hey, you know something?  There were a lot of fucking people there.  Oh, yeah.  They ran out of parking.  I remember there was a line all the way down the street. 
[00:59:30]  I think a bunch of people started...  You found another site?  Oh, there's...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Check out these video clips.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  I'm going to have to download the zip files.  Really?  Oh, boy.  What is that a picture of?  Or a video of?  This one...  Well, I think it's a girl shoving something in her vagina.  Well, the thumbnail's so small.  I see that, but I'm trying to figure out what.  Yeah.  Let's see what I can do here.  See what you can do there.  It's downloading. 
[01:00:00]  It's relatively quick.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  I'd like to see one of these.  Uh-huh.  All right.  That looks good.  Something download complete.  Okay, good.  Now, how do we find it?  So, let's just open it up and...  Yeah, this is like old school, right?  Remember this?  Oh, my God.  Now, where do you go?  Oh, this is very complicated.  Wow.  Here we go.  Is that it?  Okay, here we go.  All right.  One of the videos from that day.  I haven't seen it since.  Oh.  Windows Media Player ain't playing that shit. 
[01:00:30]  Why isn't it playing that shit?  It's probably too old.  It's in a fucking wacky format.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That isn't supported by a Windows Media file, but I'm sure something else will support it.  Oh, boy.  We'll just have to find that.  Yeah, we should find that.  Download them all and have fun watching them.  What do the videos look like there, Sam?  Well, there's...  It's hard to see from my angle.  These thumbnails are tiny.  This one that I tried to download, that woman looks like she's putting something in her vagina.  Okay.  So, that's the one I wanted to share with you.  There's one over here.  Thank you, Sam.  I really appreciate the sharing. 
[01:01:00]  That's you, and that's Jim Opie.  So, you're in this video.  Oh, right.  You're in that one.  I saw me somewhere, too.  I saw a photo of you.  Oh, okay.  There's the photo.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And Steve C is there videoing.  So, he has video somewhere.  Of course he does, probably.  Of course.  There's one of women actually on the railing bending over.  How do we open these files?  I don't know.  I've got to see these files.  Yeah, I've got to see some of these.  Can we give out the other website?  The MPEGs. 
[01:01:30]  This is the last beach party we had.  Yeah, you can give out the other website.  We're done with that one.  Here's the email over the weekend to the idiots down the hall that, you know, supposedly this  party is scheduled for maybe two and a half weeks from right now without a plan.  Mm-hmm.  No plan.  And fuck, I would redo this party in a second.  Don't get me wrong.  But no one's going to support us if this shit goes down.  No, no.  We'll get arrested.  Oh, look at this.  What happened there, Sam?  I'm trying some different players. 
[01:02:00]  I saw what happened with the real player.  Was that going to work?  Oh, no.  It needs to download a new...  Yeah, yeah.  I've got to see some permissions.  Oh, man.  That's a bad one.  Because I'm being told...  Big exclamation point.  ...that it will work with VLC player.  What's a VLC player?  It's a media player on the computer.  It's not on this computer.  Oh, everyone's saying VLC player.  Yeah, VLC.  It'll work with VLC.  So we could...  Download a VLC player.  Oh, that's right.  You can't download anything on that computer. 
[01:02:30]  No, you're not allowed to.  God forbid.  But we can...  We'll take...  Don't give out this website.  So we can extract the files.  All right.  Give out the first website where you can see the pictures we just described.  Yeah.  From our last beach party nine years ago.  Where they were absolutely coming for us.  And we're going to try to arrest us.  And then we did the Sex for Sam thing.  Yeah.  And that threw them off the scent.  They realized at that point we were in deep shit.  And just so you know, those pictures that are X'd out,  those were really... 
[01:03:00]  You think the pictures you're about to see were bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The ones that are now X'd out,  those were the fucking really bad ones.  I guess they were considered like hardcore pornography.  Sure.  Sure.  And could be a problem.  I don't know.  What's the site?  If you go to sexybuffalo.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  All the photos are there.  Sexybuffalo.com.  Sexybuffalo.com.  Wow.  Nice.  Oh, that's not a good sound.  And we're not going to be able to see those other videos. 
[01:03:30]  It doesn't look like it.  Not right now.  I mean, we'll get them.  Oh, we'll pull them.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll pull them.  Right.  I got to see those.  Memories.  Trip down memory lane.  Yes.  Oh, brother.  But do you want to do the beach party or no?  Nope.  Oh.  Nope.  Not without a plan.  That's what I said to whoever over the weekend.  Not without a plan.  Because I know they're not supporting us whatsoever if, God forbid, anything goes down.  And things go down when we don't have a plan. 
[01:04:00]  And like I said, I would love to do this exact same fucking thing.  Trust me.  Yeah, believe me.  It'd be great.  Trust me.  It would be great for everybody.  Very cool.  But I know we'll get arrested and the company will make believe we never worked for them.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Jesus.  I was a fucking stud, man.  You like yourself there?  Oh, yeah, I do.  I was a bloaty mess.  Bloaty, bloaty.  God damn.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  That was a while ago.  What?  This is another website?  Oh, yeah.  The pictures aren't quite as good.  But this is a multitude of things.  It's the same website.  It says, ticket to TNA with O&A show.  $10.  Nice.  $10.  Picture of beer.  $6.  Economical.  Finding a naked chick in the guy's bathroom washing sand and zucchini juice off herself.  Priceless.  That is the priceless moment right there.  And there she is, washing out her vagina.  Yep.  Sand.  Luckily, she still has her credentials on them. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, in case you thought the guy was lying, there's the picture of her washing out her vagina.  VIP for them meant a vegetable in pussy.  Right.  That was the VIP area.  Mark Maron, everyone.  Hey, shit.  There he is.  And the radio station was probably super happy that their logo was right there on the credentials for everyone to see.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  They couldn't have been happier.  Signage.  All right.  We should break.  Oh, yeah.  Mark Maron's early.  We'll get him in.  Don't matter. 
[01:05:30]  I think Joe DeRosa's coming by today.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Joe's here, too?  All right.  We'll get both of them in after the break.  Anything else?  Wow.  There's the wanted poster that someone jokingly made, but that was not a joke.  I'm telling you.  I did.  It was getting close.  It was getting close.  The company was trying to figure out what to do because they're like, well, we can't fire them because it wasn't an actual broadcast.  So they were confused.  How come Norton hasn't changed a bit?  Because you just shave your head.  Is that it?  I think you could look the same if you just shave your head. 
[01:06:00]  He looks exactly the same.  It's nine fucking years ago.  He actually looks a little better now because he's lost weight.  Yeah.  And he wears that exact shirt to this day.  He looks exactly the same.  Jimmy looks the same.  Which I'm not sure, you know, if that's good or bad because did he just look old then?  No.  Or does he look like young now?  It's because he shaved his head.  He is ageless.  So you don't know if he's going gray or losing hair or any of that shit because, you know, he's got the shaved head thing going on. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Wow.  I don't know what we accomplished here, but people are checking out some really good pictures right now.  Oh, yeah.  I guarantee that.  Have fun with it.  You probably have pissed off some people.  Again?  What do you mean?  What are you rolling your eyes?  You went on the air and said, I can't wait to podcast.  Of course.  That's where the world's going, though.  I know.  You work less and you probably can make about the same money.  I haven't even considered that, to tell you the truth.  Really?  No, no.  It's got a state-of-the-art fucking facility. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, you could use that for podcasting.  I never even thought of that.  Huh.  Oh, you should see.  Weird.  I put my mics in over the weekend.  They did better than anything in this shitty studio.  Why is it that Ant has a better studio in his house?  It's amazing.  And look, I know you spent some money on it, but it wasn't like, holy shit, money.  No.  You know, it's fucking Ant's studio doesn't have the character that this studio has.  Oh, no.  No, not at all.  I like it here.  It's a good character, all right.  It's great. 
[01:07:30]  And I'll say again, because I give solutions now.  The reason this happens over and over again is because they don't fucking do anything to  make the place better for us.  Yeah.  We got miserable guys because they haven't had raises in years.  Or raisins.  Or raisins.  I'm hungry as shit.  Oh, can I raise them back there?  I'm starving.  All out.  Well, you know, the whole list that we already fucking said.  But that's the reason.  You know, and then we hear we're making progress on this and that.  And then you kind of look back and go, well, you said that months ago. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  How can you be making progress on something that you told me you were making progress on  two to three months ago?  Doesn't making progress mean it's right around the corner about to happen?  That would be progress.  It means it's moving.  It's progressing.  It's a lot of stuff that has to get done here.  I feel bad for you younger guys, man.  What are you going to do?  I feel bad for you fuckers.  You don't have to.  It's a great way.  I would have never stayed in radio if it was like this. 
[01:08:30]  I would have never stayed in radio.  No?  No.  I would suggest to you guys, you move the fuck on.  What am I going to do?  Try to find something else.  I've spent almost my entire 20s.  Move somewhere else in the media world.  PFC TV.  If I was going through what you guys are going through, there's no fucking way I would have  stayed in this business.  At least we saw what this could have been and we did real well for ourselves.  I don't know how you guys ever do well for yourselves.  Because they try to just keep you fucking down. 
[01:09:00]  I was born to broadcast though, so.  Yeah, you'll continue to broadcast.  I don't know what to do.  Huh?  I don't know what, where, how, who, when, when, whatever.  I'll just enjoy my life.  I'm born to broadcast.  I don't even really need to broadcast anymore.  Fuck that.  Who would want to keep broadcasting after this experience?  Yeah.  My basement?  Great.  Oh, I forgot you do it.  You have a studio.  I keep forgetting.  Fucking noon.  Do a noon or one, two hours.  Done.  Done.  No meetings. 
[01:09:30]  Outside by the pool.  No meetings, no bitching.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I got to meet with myself.  Nothing.  Hey, what'd you think of today, Sean?  Call myself an idiot.  All right.  Joe DeRosa and Marc Maron, who has probably the hottest podcast out there.  That is true.  He rakes them in.  I think he made the New York Times over the weekend.  Was that the Times, I believe?  He does have quite the podcast.  It was the Post?  I think the Times have done some articles on him as well. 
[01:10:00]  But okay.  Yeah, the What the Fuck podcast is doing really well for Marc Maron.  Really well.  Yeah, that's something.  It's got a hell of a buzz.  So, we'll talk to him and our pal Joe DeRosa next.  Stay there.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  They try to take 8-0 to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black.  But when I come back, you won't know, no, no. 
[01:10:30]  I got the time.  If my daddy thinks I'm fine, he's trying to take me to go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  I'd rather be at home with Ray.  I ain't got 70 days.  Because there's nothing, nothing you can teach me. 
[01:11:00]  That I can learn from Mr. Hathaway.  Did I hear it?  The Virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony. 
[01:11:30]  I'm very, very happy.  We've got Joe DeRosa and Marc Maron in studio.  Thank God.  Thank God.  I was going to say, we'll stop bitching.  But then Marc had a thing.  Joey had a thing.  Everyone's got a thing.  You think everyone has a thing?  Everyone's got a thing.  Is it bitching?  Isn't that what radio's about?  Just sitting here and bitching about things.  It really is.  Yeah, a little bit.  Well, this thing is very simple.  But for some reason, they have to make it so complicated that it just blows up your brain. 
[01:12:00]  It literally blows up my brain.  How dumb all this is.  And how easy it is to fix.  But they choose not to for whatever reason.  Do you even know who's in charge here?  That becomes a big problem with bureaucratic, big business operations.  Like, who's the guy in charge?  We always talk about, when we have an issue, like, I want to go to the guy.  There's no guy.  And be able to talk to the guy.  And then you realize, oh my God, there's no guy.  There's a consortium.  There's this.  There's mid-management people that you go, well, we'll kick it upstairs and see if we 
[01:12:30]  can talk to an army of people.  It's a Wizard of Oz thing.  As far as feeling like there's a guy to go to to change things around here, there's no  guy.  There's absolutely no guy.  There's a guy that's supposedly in charge, but you go to him with all these issues and  nothing changes.  All the executives do is figure out a way to displace blame so when the shit hits the  fan, it ain't on them.  That's how they move up.  That's how they move sideways.  It's like, just make it so it's not my fault.  It's not my shit. 
[01:13:00]  How can I push this over to the other guy?  And then the guy that you hate, the guy that caused all the problems, he's now the head  of another company because he displays blame the best.  That's exactly what it is.  That's how this business works.  What did that guy ever do?  Nothing.  No one.  Why is he the king of everything?  Because they couldn't hang any shit on him.  It's no longer about accomplishment.  No, hell no.  It's how much shit you didn't fuck up.  Executive survival.  And how much you could make other people look like they fucked up.  That's it.  When we came here, we had a vision of really building this channel and having a solid group 
[01:13:30]  of guys that know how to do radio.  Mark certainly would have been on that list.  But these guys don't want to pay anyone.  So now, our channel, I like it to a point, but it's a lot of replays and we were able  to get a couple guys in.  But this should have been, instead of Mark having a podcast and Bill Burr having a podcast  and Bob Kelly having a podcast, all those guys should have been part of this.  We could have all been hanging out right over here.  Oh, yeah.  They offered Patrice a deal the other day.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Patrice laughed at him.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Are they still selling the exposure angle?  Oh, boy.  It's great exposure.  It took us years to catch on to that.  You know what I mean?  That's just great exposure.  What the hell does that mean?  We're not paying you and we might get you coffee.  Yeah, it's free.  Russ, Russ Beneve, he made a great point when they did this coalition a few years back where  the comics got together and tried to demand more money and stuff like that.  And Russ made a great point about all the networks that will come to you and say, do 
[01:14:30]  this clip show.  It's free, but it's great exposure.  And he goes, the next time they say that to you, why don't you tell the fucking producer  that he's not going to get paid, but the show is great exposure for him.  He was like, they'd spit on you.  That's hilarious.  They would.  Yeah.  That's great.  It's always a pride thing, too.  I mean, I always, I never did those clip shows.  I never did one either.  But you know what the sad side of that is?  A lot of guys took off from those clip shows.  I was the guy, when Chelsea Handler got her show, when she first got her show, I had shot 
[01:15:00]  my Comedy Central Presents on the same night as her.  We did back-to-back shows, two shows, and she got her show, and they asked me if I wanted  to be on it.  I'm like, nah, fuck that.  That's not going anywhere.  Now it's like the biggest show in the world.  I'm not doing the VH1 clip shows.  That's bullshit.  Those guys are selling out arenas.  Yeah, all the comics associated with her are doing really, really well.  Thank God for my pride.  I mean, I'm a real genius.  They came to Patrice recently, and they're like, all right, cool.  We'd love to have him, you know, part of this channel. 
[01:15:30]  Well, the offer was so bad, Patrice did the double, like, with his fingers, made his Patrice  O'Neill look, and walked away.  Jesus Christ.  There was no words exchanged.  No, why would there be?  It was an insult.  A bit of theater.  Just a crinkled nose.  And a little...  I think there was a hand clap in there.  You were saying before the break about how, like, the state of the, you know, if it was  this bad when you started, you wouldn't be in it, and why are you guys still sticking 
[01:16:00]  around?  The younger guys, and it's like, it literally, remember in Star, like, it's the pride that  keeps you here.  It's like that part at the end of Star Wars, when the rebels are about to blow up the Death  Star, and the guy's like, I think we should evacuate, sir.  He's like, evacuate in our moment of triumph?  Moment of triumph.  That's where we're all just standing on the Death Star.  Oh, it's going to work.  They should have called Sirius a Death Star.  He might have sold better in the long run. 
[01:16:30]  We're an evil empire.  That's funny.  We're kind of at the end of this, but for the young guys, man, I don't know how the fuck  they're going to, you know, stick it out.  I don't know.  Just don't know how they're going to do it.  Well, I think our expectations are different.  I mean, I think when you guys started, I didn't get into radio.  I got into radio on a fluke, and that place, you know, when it came in to be, when Air  America came to be, whatever happened there, because of management happened,  but I certainly got a good sense of what terrestrial radio was, and you could tell then it was  dying.  But there was a time, I think, when you guys started, where the payday was good. 
[01:17:00]  If you could capture your market and hold it, you made some good money.  Real good money.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it was amazing.  Those days are long gone.  Trust me.  Right.  We're doing okay.  I'm not complaining.  People have much worse lives.  Trust me.  Yes.  But what it used to be compared to what it is now, it's night and day.  But still, you want the audience.  I mean, that's what's the tricky thing is how do you hold on to your audience, how do  you grow your audience?  It depends how you do it.  It is always about that.  We're all looking at you, because the WTF podcast that you're doing is getting a lot  of attention and exposure.  Yeah.  Well, that was a unique thing, and it's not so much that it was a fluke, but I came into 
[01:17:30]  this medium when it was just starting to take off.  There were guys that were doing it before me, and there were guys that there's thousands  of podcasts out there, but I just approached it not like I did radio.  You have full freedom.  You've got full freedom here, but still, you've got these problems with the infrastructure  and the company and everything else.  I don't have fucking anything.  I'm just sitting there in my garage.  They can't even figure out how to get interns back on our show.  They can't even figure out that problem.  What do you mean?  They can't.  We had an issue.  Let's just put it that way. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  But everyone was punished for the issue.  Yeah.  Okay?  So we're past the issue.  You know when you maybe do time in jail, but you get out, and then you can go move on  with your life?  You're rehabilitated.  But for some reason-  I got you as a line cook right now.  But everyone was punished, did their time, and they still can't figure out how to get  interns on this show, which we desperately need.  That's problem one out of many.  Well, that's what Joe said.  The weird thing is that when you're guys like us, when I hit the wall and I was broke in that  fucking divorce, I didn't know what I was going to do. 
[01:18:30]  I couldn't get a job.  And that's why I decided to do that podcast.  Yeah.  Is that, what's your plan B?  I ain't got no plan B.  You just mentioned line cook.  That's a reasonable option.  There's part of my brain that thinks, I did that in college.  Get me a spatula.  Let's go.  It's like riding a bike.  I can do that.  Well, you guys are also stand-ups, though.  So, I mean, you got income coming in.  What are you talking about?  But did you, before the podcast, I couldn't get work.  Mark who?  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I mean, you guys knew me because I worked around here.  But my manager literally, literally, when I started that podcast, I was broke. 
[01:19:00]  I got nothing.  My manager says, no one wants to book you.  No one wants, you know, no one wants to do anything with you.  And I'm like, well, what do we do?  He goes, I don't know.  How's my hair?  You know, that was a conversation.  Now, are you being booked now that the podcast is taking off?  Yeah, it changed everything.  It changed everything.  Can I ask you, if you don't want to say it's fine.  How many people are downloading your podcast a week?  We get overall downloads a week or in between 400 and 500,000.  And that's across, you know, we're coming up on 195 episodes. 
[01:19:30]  And the most recent 50 are always up.  But now, like, you know, things have changed a bit because the medium, anytime something happens  that gets any of us exposure, it brings more people to that medium.  The thing is, is that there are still guys my age who are like, wait, how do you get a pod what?  Yeah.  I mean, how hard is it to hook your fucking iPod up to the thing and download a radio show?  But a lot of people just don't know.  They haven't made that jump yet.  Yeah.  Right.  So now that's starting to happen.  So the audience for all of them is growing.  And the other question, you're making money? 
[01:20:00]  Well, yeah.  But you've got to figure it out.  I'm no business guy.  I'm a moron.  I can't even keep my desk organized.  Is it nice pocket money?  Oh, no.  It's definitely starting to turn into something.  It's a real thing.  Well, the problem is, because that's the problem a lot of people have had when they start their  podcast.  Like, well, this is great, but how do we make money?  Well, I'll give you a quick lesson.  You've heard that a million fucking times, right?  I'll give you a quick lesson, if I could.  And I'm not being, I mean, I had to learn all this.  When we started, we just did the donor model.  Like, hey, you like it?  Help us out.  I remember that.  Yeah, kicking some money.  And now what happened is, as the thing grew, we got real advertisers coming. 
[01:20:30]  So it's not, you're operating like terrestrial, only you're the GM.  Do you have a staff?  Right.  No, it's just me and a friend.  And, you know, we kind of work together, and we bring in, we can, and the thing about  the podcast, you can show people your numbers.  You know what they are.  It's not like, it's not like these books.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like these spinnable books.  Like, when the age group from 18 to 18 and a half, we got 400,000 listeners from 7 to 8 o'clock.  That's your time.  And that's bullshit.  Now you're like, I know exactly what we're doing.  You want a piece of this? 
[01:21:00]  And so they're coming in.  You can show them the downloads.  Merch.  You got merch.  You got that kind of stuff.  You've got to figure out a bunch of ways.  The app.  Got the WTF app.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's what you got to do.  Monetize it.  As I sit here on July 25th, 2011, there's no reason to stay here.  You want to go?  There's no reason to stay here.  I'm not even joking.  If they fire to me tomorrow, I'll start this podcast thing.  And I'll be way happier.  As I sit here, there's no fucking reason why we should stay here. 
[01:21:30]  I would go.  Well, we're under a contract.  Oh, okay.  I'll hang out.  But there's going to be some serious discussions in the coming couple weeks, because I've just  about had it.  Yeah.  We can't get interns.  We can't get these guys raises.  We can't get interns.  Anthony has a better studio in his house that he's not even using yet.  It's in construction right now.  Yeah.  I've just got my last lighting.  No, no.  I actually was doing it for a while.  And it's a pisser.  I call it Life from the Compound.  Uh-huh.  And it's a video also.  Yeah.  It's like I have a green screen. 
[01:22:00]  And it looks like I'm in a giant professional facility.  But I'm drunk off my ass and just rambling.  I wanted it to look like a professional broadcast run by a fucking degenerate.  And it's exactly what it comes off as.  And it's a visual element that we wanted for this show that they couldn't figure that out either.  I did like a thing like Movie Night where I played Twister and it was on the screen.  And then I'm in the corner and we're just beating the shit out of the movie like a mystery 
[01:22:30]  science theater thing.  Right, right, right.  I did a live simulcast of Charlie Sheen's first podcast that he did.  Yeah, yeah.  And you just rip it apart as they're doing it live.  I could hook it up to any cable station.  I could pipe in on virtual screens behind me.  It's all like a chroma key and everything.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's fantastic.  So I got lights coming in.  I just had lights come in yesterday for the back.  And I got my backlighting truss going in tomorrow.  So I just put all the mics in over the weekend.  Does this feel like a college radio station to you at this point? 
[01:23:00]  I know you didn't do college radio, but you know what I'm trying to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like your studio at home is way better than this.  I cannot tell you how perfect this studio at my house is.  Well, do it.  It sounds like you're at home.  I am.  You're building a ship to leave the planet.  I'm absolutely building a lifeboat.  You do have to prepare for your future.  Absolutely.  If they kick me out tomorrow because I'm bitching too much, I'm completely fine.  Trust me.  That's like just the front part of the lights up front.  I can see this in a year or two. 
[01:23:30]  It's just going to be you writing your manifesto and talking about it.  Yeah, hey, son of a minute.  I do have a Nazi war poster in the background.  Don't let him Bruce here.  That's like...  This is in his house.  That's my view.  No, you can...  You know?  It's radio.  Yeah, how much...  You know, you can...  You just need a couple of good mics.  You decide to go all in.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Yeah, it's got a window where...  You've got an on-air light.  That's the original on-air light from WNEW that we used to use.  My brother was in there.  Who's that for?  I know.  It's just kind of a cool little thing to have. 
[01:24:00]  But, yeah.  Anthony made a window, so if people were hanging out in his house, they could look through the  window at the broadcast.  I thought Anthony might be making up people.  I have not only the green screen and everything, but the green room is the whole outside.  I've got a bar area and everything.  Oh, forget about it.  I'm ready.  And before this goes by, Seth in Illinois on Instant Feedback, he just sent us a folder  with a bunch of pictures and video from the beach party.  Oh.  So we don't have to tell much shit.  I want to grab that up.  Thank you, Seth.  I was at Maren's house. 
[01:24:30]  Remember I was going to rent your apartment when you moved to L.A.?  Oh, you're lucky you didn't do that.  Oh, what happened?  Well, no, no.  Eventually, Leo Allen, he took the apartment.  But, you know, in the name of transparency, I did not tell him that it once had bedbugs.  But apparently, but they're gone.  You know, they're gone until the next generation spawns in 2017.  No, apparently they live forever.  Go ahead.  It's all right.  It was a year and a half ago, though, or something like that.  And I came out and I didn't really know Mark very well. 
[01:25:00]  And I just went out to look at his apartment.  We're sitting in his kitchen talking.  And I was like, what are you up to?  And you were like, I started this podcast, man.  You know, fuck.  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  And you had a message from David Cross on your phone because you were just starting to reach out to your friends to do the show.  To help me.  And then a year and a half later, it's like the number one pod.  It's just crazy to see it make that jump.  Have you changed it a little bit?  Because obviously, we haven't seen you in a while.  I mean, when you started the podcast, it was talking to all the comedians and really getting into what they're all about. 
[01:25:30]  But I would assume at this point, you've run out of comedians.  So you've got to be like it.  Oh, no.  No, you'd be surprised.  But are you expanding the things you're talking about?  Well, no.  I do like a 10, 15-minute monologue up front.  And then I usually talk to someone for an hour.  I've spread out the guests a little bit.  But now we've got – I did some interesting things, man.  I mean, I'll take it on the road.  I went up to Jonathan Winters' house in Santa Barbara.  And I sat with Jonathan Winters for an hour.  And it was profound.  And it was one of the more amazing things I'd ever done to sit there with this guy. 
[01:26:00]  What made it amazing?  Because he's still got a lot of clarity.  You know, his mood changes.  And he was a little tired.  But as soon as he turns on that thing, it's like time travel.  It's like listening to his old records.  He's going in and out of characters.  He's doing whole bits.  He's improvising things right in front of you.  And he's just sitting there.  He's kind of hobbled because he's arthritic and stuff.  But it was just – it was like being in the presence of real genius.  And it's rare that that happens.  How old is he?  He's 85 years old.  Wow.  And then the funniest thing was is like – because, you know, Jonathan, he's a real genius, that guy. 
[01:26:30]  And, you know, he's been around forever.  And I remember looking at old footage of him when I went to the Museum of Broadcasting before they had the internet and seeing him on the Jack Parr show.  And no one knew what the fuck that guy was going to do.  And he's just this sweet – he's almost like a Buddha.  And he lives in this big house in Santa Barbara.  And he goes, let me show you something.  And we're walking down this hallway.  And he's got his cane.  And he's walking very slowly.  And there's all these pictures along the wall of him with movie stars and people from his life.  And he just – he points to this one picture of this boy and a dog.  And he goes, I like that dog. 
[01:27:00]  And then we keep walking down the hallway.  And he goes, this is where I sleep.  They moved his bedroom into – close to the living room because he's old.  But you walk into this room and it's like this four-post bed.  And he's got about 60 model planes hanging from the ceiling.  And he says, those are my planes.  But just to picture that guy, this very sensitive genius of a comedian just laying in bed looking at his planes going, I like this. 
[01:27:30]  It was beautiful.  It was beautiful.  So I still do mostly comics, but I take it on the road sometimes and I do some other stuff.  So you're obviously expanding.  I had – Dice came in.  I haven't put it up yet.  He came in.  And I was very – you guys probably talked to him a lot, haven't you?  Oh, yeah.  He's a friend of the show.  Yeah, but I hadn't known him.  He's in a mom, matter of fact.  Is he?  Say hi to him.  Because I hadn't really talked to him since I was a doorman at the comedy store.  And I remember when I was there when he broke, when he became big.  And then about six months ago, I saw him do 40 minutes.  And it was amazing. 
[01:28:00]  It was hilarious.  And he's talking about going to Staples with his kids.  And it was like, this is a different Dice.  So I had him in there, and sometimes it gets very intimidating to me because you don't  want to piss him off in any way.  But a lot of times, because I'll sit there and just talk one-on-one for an hour, it starts  to loosen up.  They start talking in a way that they don't usually talk.  And he told me his kid does comedy.  And first of all, I couldn't even picture him having a kid.  I never even assumed it.  Two boys.  Right.  I saw this kid do coming to the store. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  So I called the kid, and I had him on, too.  Oh, shit.  Just to ask him what it's like to have Dice as a dad.  And he has a very well-adjusted, nice kid.  Yeah, he does.  And he's a very sweet guy.  So I'm still pretty excited just about talking to dudes.  Although they're not boys anymore.  I think they're grown men at this point.  How was Dice's?  19, I think.  How was Dice's kid on stage?  He was pretty good.  He was kind of like a little bit of a nerdier kid.  He wasn't what you were expecting.  But he was new at it. 
[01:29:00]  So he was doing stuff that was way more like his dad.  And I was like, oh, he's just doing what he thinks he's supposed to do right now.  These jokes are well-written, but he's going to come around into his voice soon and be  like the kid that's, instead of being like, hey, he's going to be like, hey, my dad's that.  I'm kind of a little bit of a nerd or whatever.  He's like a big shadow to a girl.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, no kidding.  You know?  Dice is on Entourage this year.  He's excited about it.  Anybody watch last night? 
[01:29:30]  I cannot watch that show.  I turned it on.  Actually, I was watching something on HBO before that.  And then I turned it on and I was like, I can't watch this.  This show makes me sick.  LA, whoa, these guys are so extreme.  They're partying.  It's crazy.  Really?  It makes me sick.  I never lived in that LA.  What LA is that?  I lived in the one-bedroom LA with like, where are my papers?  Which box is it in?  How come I can't find my notebook? 
[01:30:00]  That's how I came up in LA.  They did the same show week after week.  That was the problem.  I like the first, I think I made two seasons.  And what are they up to now?  Eight or nine?  I couldn't eat.  I don't even know.  But it's at least five seasons.  The lead character was like, I guess last season, because they kind of recapped a little,  was all strung out on drugs and all fucked up and everything.  Yeah.  And then he got busted.  And I guess they opened up the season with him in rehab.  Yeah.  And three months clean.  Yeah.  And he's like, you know, sober is sexy. 
[01:30:30]  And it was like one of these, oh, are they giving me a lesson?  Go fuck yourself.  Are they teaching, you know, the people that he's okay now?  And what's the struggle going to be to get his trust back so he gets a movie role?  Who the fuck knows?  Who gave a shit?  I was watching like, oh, yeah, man.  Here they go.  Wow, we got our four-door continental with the suicide doors, and we're going to fucking  go out and party.  I swear to God, it's a true story.  I dated this girl once, and we were in bed one night, we were watching Entourage, and 
[01:31:00]  she told me, she's like, I met Adrian Grenier once at a party, and he tried to fuck me, right?  And I go, really?  Did you fuck him?  He's insanely good looking.  And she goes, no way.  No.  He was all like, oh, I'm Adrian Grenier, so you're just supposed to fuck me.  Can you believe that shit?  And I'm like, really?  Because you fucked me, dummy.  Hey, I'm Joe DeRozan.  You're supposed to fuck me.  You fucking idiot. 
[01:31:30]  It's a nice moment to have where you realize you're just, your relationship is just some  sort of outpouring of her low self-esteem.  Of course I fucked you.  I hate myself.  That must have made you feel great.  You got the right girl, Joe.  I want more stories from the podcast world.  I love the Jonathan Winters one.  Oh, yeah.  Anyone else surprise you or disappoint you?  I don't know where you want to go with this.  Well, no, I mean, it's just a little weird when, it's still odd. 
[01:32:00]  Because, like, Conan O'Brien, I asked him to do the show on his show, and he agreed to it.  So, like, with me, because there's still part of me that doesn't believe, you know, I deserve anything or that I'm in show business.  Like, he comes to my house.  Were you guys friends?  No, we're not friends.  I do a show.  I never spent any...  I know you've been on there a bunch, but besides that, you don't really know each other.  I have no friends.  There's very few people I hang out with.  I usually find one girl, and I drain her of her life essence, and that's how I live my life. 
[01:32:30]  Move on, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, that one's a husk.  I'm going to move on to the...  But, uh...  Mark's like the thing in Fallen.  Just jump from body to body.  Body to body.  Like, if I'm with a woman, they're excited, I'm excited, but anybody who looks at me from the outside says, oh, he's feeding.  So...  Wait, there's two things now.  I want to know about Conan, but now, the last time you were in the relationship, you were going out with a younger woman. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah, and it blew up.  It's done.  Well, no, no, that's a...  Oh, my God, dude.  It's been a while.  You already were hinting, like, oh, fuck.  No, no, well, she was going to come this morning, so that's where we're at now.  Oh, okay.  But, no, but Conan comes over.  Here's what happens to me.  He comes over, and I talk to him about this, you know, a little bit on his show, is that he comes to my house.  I don't know him other than being on the show.  We have an hour-long conversation.  It's a great talk.  He's very candid.  Yeah, he's very serious.  He talks about a lot of stuff.  I didn't know him at all. 
[01:33:30]  And then there's that moment where we leave the garage.  I live in a small little house.  It's two-bedroom.  It's all I can handle.  I don't know how the fuck people have big houses.  Because, like, I walk past that second bedroom every day, and there's nothing in there but an empty bed and her clothes.  And I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do with that room?  That makes me panicky.  If I had a third bedroom, I'd kill myself because I wouldn't know what to do with it.  But so he's in the garage, and we walk into the living room, and he's sort of lingering.  And this is Conan O'Brien.  You know, he's six foot tall.  I only know him as Conan O'Brien, the guy who has me on his show. 
[01:34:00]  And he's fucking Conan O'Brien.  There's this moment I have where I'm like, I've got to get him out of my house.  Because I have no idea how to deal with this shit.  You know, like, what, are we going to have lunch?  Are we going to have dinner?  We don't know each other.  You're going to go, and I'm going to be, you know, happy you did my podcast.  But right now, I don't know how to continue this.  Yeah, please leave before I screw this up.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I'm going to fuck this up somehow.  It went well.  Just get out of here now.  You get that feeling, too.  When am I coming over to your house?  It's good to know.  So that happens a lot.  Like, you know, Paul Reiser came over, and that was kind of weird.  Because sometimes these guys, they get sent over by their publicists. 
[01:34:30]  If I want to get them, but they don't know who I am.  And then they have that thing.  It's like, what the hell is this?  What are we doing here?  Oh, really?  So there's some of those moments that make me feel a little uncomfortable.  What did you get out of Conan?  Anything?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I got a lot about, I mean, you know, no breaking news.  Other than, you know, he made a joke about having a huge cock.  Which is, you know, you don't expect that.  And also, he talked a lot about, you know, what he studied at Harvard.  I was kind of curious about the whole Harvard thing.  Because I've always wondered, like, is there some secret system? 
[01:35:00]  Are you guys guaranteed entry into show business?  What do they do to you over there?  Is there rituals?  Do you kill rabbits?  What's happening at Harvard that makes it so special?  But, you know, he talked about what he studied.  And so a lot of times I don't, like I interviewed Dave Attell.  I've known Attell for 25 years.  And I don't think I've had more than a seven-minute conversation with him.  And here's a, if you haven't seen Dave Attell in like two years, you say,  Dave, what's up?  He goes, what?  And then you go, and then you say, how you been?  Fine, what?  And that's usually the end of it.  You know, you don't press any harder. 
[01:35:30]  If you're lucky, he'll shit on you somehow.  So, you know, for him to sit down for an hour, that's the weird thing is because we're comics,  we assume we all know each other, which we do.  And I feel a real close bond with all the dudes in my community.  But most of us have never fucking talked for more than 15 minutes.  No, dude.  Aside from your kitchen, the first time I ever sat down and really talked to you was on your podcast  in front of an audience of comics.  And that's what happened, you know?  And it was great, though.  And I felt like, oh, I learned a little bit about Mark today.  And, you know, we didn't exchange, you know? 
[01:36:00]  That's the most flattering thing about the thing is that, you know, if I was a young comic  and I had the outlet of my show, like, if you were able to listen to the guys that you  respect actually have a conversation for an hour, that would have blew my fucking mind.  Yeah, of course.  It was like, remember when they used to have, when Comedy Central first became Comedy Central,  they had Inside the Comedy Mind?  Alan King, Inside the Comic Mind.  You know, I'm talking to Dennis Leary, a young comic.  I guess you remember.  I was like 12, but it blew me away.  I wasn't even a comic yet. 
[01:36:30]  Alan King, what a...  All right.  All right.  No, no, no, you're right, though.  Oh, oh.  He blew me away.  Sorry.  That's hilarious.  Yes.  Inside the comic mind.  Yeah, I'm talking to one of the young guns, Robin Williams, is here.  I do love it.  How do you figure out how to make up things?  I totally remember that.  God damn.  That's wonderful.  Wow.  This fellow, I don't know that well.  Martin Short, he does voices. 
[01:37:00]  Very interesting.  He interviewed Bob Hope once.  I actually watched it at the Museum of Radio and Television, and it just made me depressed  because it was right when Bob Hope was teetering on diapers.  Oh, boy.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was just too late.  He was almost there, but he kept drifting off and looking at his golf course and shit  in the background.  I was just thinking about all that Orange Grove money, owning the valley.  Look at this.  Nothing gets better. 
[01:37:30]  I just shit myself, and I can't use this money at all.  No amount of money is going to make me stop shitting myself.  You know what, though?  That's a good thing to remember.  It sure is.  It really is.  I've had that moment in the locker room at the YMCA many times where you see, like, that's  why you've got to go to the Y because guys from all ages go to the Y.  And when you see a guy who's like 75 years old, you know, just wrestling his balls into  his fucking jockstrap, you've got to have a moment where you're like, if I'm lucky, 
[01:38:00]  I'll have that.  If I'm lucky to make it that far.  Or you see the one guy, I saw a guy wearing a diaper because he had his prostate removed.  And he's like there, and he's talking to guys, and he's just standing there going, it's  going to happen to you.  It's going to happen to you.  No shame, right?  He just goes with it.  But you know, that's what's great about the Y.  It's a community service to make you realize that you're mortal.  That's where you take the podcast when you run out of comics.  Go start interviewing those guys.  That would be a good podcast. 
[01:38:30]  From the Y locker room?  Yes, that's the world I live in.  I would fucking do that podcast in a second.  No, I love doing stuff like that.  Fuck yeah.  I'm going to interview this guy.  I went to a guy in my neighborhood.  I live in sort of a barrio, kind of a Mexican neighborhood.  And I always drove by this.  All the signs, like on York where I live, are hand-painted.  It's like Juarez down there.  And there's an adjacent one.  Well, whatever.  There's an optometrist sign.  And then someone sent me this optometrist.  And I said, that optometrist?  Because I went to an eyeglass place in the neighborhood. 
[01:39:00]  And the woman's like, yeah, that dude, he plays in a jazz combo.  He's like this weird.  So I'm like, I got to go now.  And you walk into this optometrist's office in this Latino neighborhood.  He's got jazz records everywhere.  And he's this Jew from Indiana who plays in a jazz combo.  And you just sit there getting your eyes examined.  He's talking in that weird bebop voice.  Oh, man, that guy could groove, dude.  He got strung out.  And his old lady didn't want to have nothing to do with him anymore.  Can you see the bottom line?  But I was like, I got to get that guy in the show, you know? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, hell yeah.  Oh, that's fucking great.  Mark seems happy.  I like this.  Yeah, it's a new thing.  You know what I started doing?  It's all new.  You know what I started doing?  Maybe I can learn from you.  How do you get happy?  Well, what happened was, through the arc of the podcast, I started broke, divorced, miserable.  You guys knew me.  And then, like, literally, through the arc of the podcast, I was calling comics.  I don't know if they realized this, but I needed help.  So, like, a lot of my interviews are like, I'm fucked up.  What would you do?  And so, somehow or another, what doesn't seem to be happening right now is I don't wake up in the morning going, 
[01:40:00]  what the fuck am I going to do with my life?  Somehow or another, that's gone away, and that seemed to be a big problem.  I'm not beating the shit out of myself every day.  Is that all right?  Can I not do that?  Yeah, that's good.  I can start again.  It's right there.  You got a purpose.  A little bit.  I'm busy, and it's my own thing.  So, who am I going to get pissed off at?  You know, there's no boss to get pissed off at.  That's fucking great.  So, if I get pissed off, it's only going to be at me.  It's on you.  Yeah, so I try not to do that too much. 
[01:40:30]  But it was on me before, too.  I never blamed the right people.  But a lot of that's gone.  And you're one of those comics where, you know, you're a guy that pushes buttons,  and, you know, I hate using the word edgy, but you know what I mean.  And I think, like, in that kind of forum, correct me if I'm wrong, it gives you a chance  to express yourself in a much more free zone, where you don't have to worry about the drunk  heckling you.  You don't have to worry about the stupid bitch, you know.  With the bachelorette party.  Yeah, with the bachelorette party.  You know what I mean? 
[01:41:00]  But because of the podcast, he's getting more work ever soon.  So, he's still dealing with that.  I don't understand your point, Joe.  My point is that I think every comic needs an outlet, right?  And I think especially for a comic like Mark, when you have that other thing where it's  not 100% resting on the live performance, where you have this other zone, or this outlet  where you can get this stuff out, then you're not looking at the stand-up in the same light  anymore.  It's not just, I gotta fucking get my feelings about this out on stage.  I'm on the same page. 
[01:41:30]  Because now that I'm doing more side projects, I don't care about this place at all.  No, I get what you're saying.  Because when that's all I had, I'm like, fuck, it would wear me out.  But now that I know I have freedom on these dumb side projects where I don't have to listen  to anyone or talk to anybody, I get it.  I get your point.  You're doing what you want to do.  Yeah.  And the weird thing is, is like with that, with, like, I realized that most of my career,  like, I don't do politics on the show.  I really don't.  Like, I got to this point where you start to realize, I used to think I was angry about 
[01:42:00]  something.  And then, and then if you go a little deeper, you're like, oh shit, I'm just fucking angry.  You know, where do I point that?  And, you know, and, and politics can be sort of like a template for your anger.  You know, you just sort of like wear it like you're going to shoot shit.  And then I started to talk and I realized that most people's problems are just, you know,  day to day existential bullshit problems.  Yeah.  Because everyone's just trying to get by and most of their energy, you know, is goes into  helping people don't think they're out of their fucking mind.  And so, so that means that most people in their minds are going, oh God, I'm an asshole. 
[01:42:30]  That guy's an asshole.  What the fuck am I going to do?  How am I going to, so I just sort of talked from that place because it was weird.  I did Bill Marshall for the first time the other night.  I did two lines, two lines of politics.  And all of a sudden I'm back in this fucking firing line again.  All of a sudden, like the right way I'm on Hannity, you know, uh, you know, the clip  is on Hannity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that bill was taking most of the hit, but I just couldn't believe to be put into that  position.  It's like two words and just these morons are like, oh, someone crucify the Jew with 
[01:43:00]  the filthy mouth.  You think Air America, uh, hurt you for a while there?  Well, I think what it was is that, you know, I want, I got involved with that because I  was not inherently a political comic.  I was just a reactionary person, which I still am.  But I, I mean, I got involved because I was unhappy with the Bush administration and I  wanted to help try to, you know, take it down.  I mean, that's why I got involved in it.  But I think in the long run, if you're involved with politics in an exclusive way, of course  it's going to hurt you because anytime you go out on the road, if you're not a big star,  all they know about you, if they don't know your comedy, they don't know you, but they 
[01:43:30]  know you're on Air America.  Lefty.  Well, you're going to divide the room.  Lefty.  That means the righties aren't coming to see it, which is a shame because Mark is an amazing  stand-up.  Right.  It's got nothing to do with that.  Amazing.  And I think it did something smart because I remember we would try to push it down some political avenues  and you're like, ah, that's the old man.  I remember you would deflect like, no, I'm trying to move past that.  Right.  And I think in a way that was really smart on your part.  Well, it was just me being honest with myself.  If it affects me personally and I'm pissed off about it, I'll talk about it. 
[01:44:00]  Sure.  And, you know, I've certainly got my point of view and I am more, I am a lefty, but it's  not my wheelhouse to sit there.  There's too many people that do it better than me and my comedy is really about being human.  It's not about politics because I think people hide behind that and it drives me nuts.  Yeah, that's, wow, that makes a lot of sense.  It is.  No, it does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It does.  It divides the room.  Especially coming from me, you know.  Well, it's tough.  I've been called a lot of things, never left. 
[01:44:30]  But on certain issues, you have to be to do what you're doing.  I'm completely, see, a lot of people are like, yeah, like I'm a typical fucking right  wing Republican fucking hardliner.  That's bullshit.  No, you're a libertarian hardliner.  Exactly.  I'm a libertarian hardliner.  No, like gay marriage, like I could give a shit.  I don't fucking care if people want to get married.  That's fine.  And they just showed the first couple in New York that got married.  Yeah.  And I'm not even fucking kidding.  I don't know if it was two guys or two girls. 
[01:45:00]  I couldn't fucking tell.  You fucking Republican piece of shit.  You motherfucker.  You fucking close minded.  They were old people.  They were real old.  How old?  And they were either old men or old ladies.  I swear I couldn't tell.  It doesn't matter.  They're people.  They're people.  They love each other.  Let him have it.  Of course.  Here it is.  They were gals, first of all.  Gals.  One is 85 and one is 77.  That's sweet.  That's what, that's the gay community being represented in marriage? 
[01:45:30]  Why do you need to get married at 85?  They look like twins, though.  Because they spent their entire lives not being able to publicly acknowledge or honor their  life.  Christ, they lived in a time, if they were, if they'd been together for 40 years, just the  fact that they're doing that in that picture would have meant they'd been thrown out of  a village.  Look how old they are.  Yes.  They're in a village.  These two eligible gals, gentlemen.  But let me ask you some.  Why isn't that dance card being punched?  Let me ask you some about libertarianism.  Well, basically, all you really want is, is you want to keep your money and you want 
[01:46:00]  people to stay out of your yard.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's all we all want.  That's it.  You're absolutely right.  Everybody wants that.  And if you work, if you're going to be in my yard, I have a gun to keep you out of my  yard.  Right.  I'm allowed to have it.  You leave my money alone.  Right.  And I can have my own police force.  I'm it.  That's pretty much it.  That's what I like.  If my house catches on fire, I got a hose.  I'm not paying for the fire department.  Fuck it.  I'll take care of it myself.  All right.  I'm not paying for anything.  I don't want anything from you.  Stay out of my yard.  I like teetering on anarchy. 
[01:46:30]  Sure.  We call these drugs.  Just keep the drunkies out of my yard.  All right.  I understand.  This is a new Mark Mariner.  I love that.  You took all your vitamins?  Oh, God.  Dude, it's gotten to the point where I talk about it on stage.  I can't even be critical of religious people anymore.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I take vitamins.  Vitamins.  And I believe they work.  And if that isn't dogma, I don't know what the hell is.  Like, I don't know what the fuck they do, but if I don't take them for two days, I think 
[01:47:00]  something horrible is going to happen to me, and I'm a bad person.  I get a vegetable drink every day.  I figure there's enough vitamins in that shit.  Because I'm getting older.  I don't know what's wrong with my heel.  I don't know how it happened.  But now I walk with a limp occasionally.  When did that happen?  It just happens.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  No, it's a...  We've all been mined.  I'm training with this guy at a gym, and he's like, you've got to get protein powder and  drink it, right?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, and I'm like, okay.  And he's like, you have to do it. 
[01:47:30]  It's one of your meals every day.  I'm like, okay.  And I buy the shit, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, I'm not fucking doing this.  I'm not on a space shuttle right now.  I'm not making this fucking...  It's literally like fucking future food.  Like, the way they make you eat now, powder into fucking drinks and pellets and shit like  that.  How old are you?  It's ridiculous.  33.  You can still do it.  See, because that shit puts fat on you.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't pump it out...  You have to...  Yeah.  You have to run around like a fucking 12-year-old to make sure...  You've got to make it muscle.  ...it doesn't turn into fat.  Which I'm not going to be doing.  Exactly.  That's why I'm saying this might be bad for you. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Those guys who eat protein...  I went down the protein fucking route a couple years ago.  I was like, what the fuck?  It adds weight on you fast.  Oh, you've got to work out.  Unless you're running around like a lunatic all day long.  And you put a pump in the iron to make your muscles big.  I was working out a lot, but it was like, I couldn't keep up with it.  Those guys that are huge, they just...  Oh, they feed on protein powder and they shit anti-matter.  You know, they just...  It's terrible that protein powder, because then 10 years go by and whatever muscle you  had, we'll fucking start fucking falling on you.  But the point is, like, I don't understand... 
[01:48:30]  Like, they didn't have these fucking pellets and powders 30 years ago, let alone whatever.  And you have the in shape, out of shape, guys.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about on this show.  With a barrel chest and gut.  Oh, God.  But they were like, yeah.  Nothing's funnier than when a guy that's too old puts on muscle and he's hunched like  this.  With fucking...  Or they don't work out right and they're all neck.  Yeah.  I see those guys in the gym.  Yeah.  They just like...  They look like a human cock.  So you got a trainer that wants you to...  There you go. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, no.  That's a perfect example.  Oh, no.  So you got a trainer that wants you to do protein drinks?  He's telling me to do protein drinks.  And shit.  I'm like, dude, I bought...  And he insists on it.  He...  I mean, he doesn't batter me.  I don't know what the fucking word is.  How about you just get on a good exercise program and try to eat a little better?  He's got me on one.  That's all we all need.  I've been eating decently.  You know, and he's not a Nazi.  He's like, you can have some bacon and eggs in the morning.  It's good protein.  You know, he's not a Nazi about it.  But he is big on the vitamins and all that shit.  And it just makes me feel like it's like Planet of the Apes or some shit. 
[01:49:30]  You know what I mean?  I like when I take a piss and it looks like the inside of a glow stick.  Yeah.  It's a fun morning.  What the fuck happened?  Yeah.  The vitamins, they'll do that.  I used to do the vitamins.  It stains the front of your fucking underwear.  Yeah.  The white yellow fucking drips.  You really are an old man.  It stains the front of my skivvies.  My skivvies.  The drip.  You don't stain your underwear yet?  No.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  What do you mean stain your underwear?  No.  That's if you just don't shake enough. 
[01:50:00]  You know, you're going to drop a little too.  So that's all right?  I think so.  That's not right because I don't know what the hell's happening.  I think so.  If you just take a quick piss and you want to get it and you'll run back out.  Yeah.  You're like, maybe I should have shook a little bit.  What about peeing in the night?  See, now like last night I'm at the hotel with the girl and I got up to pee like three  times, but I also had four, no, I had four iced teas at dinner.  Oh, okay.  So I mean, when is my prostate going to fall out of my ass?  What age is that happening?  I'll tell you this much.  I can't drink liquids past five where I won't get up in the middle of the night.  What the fuck is wrong with you guys? 
[01:50:30]  I've been checked out.  I've gotten up to piss at night.  I've been checked out.  I'm fine.  Yeah.  It's like, how the fuck do you not piss at night?  I drink.  It's the alcohol dehydrates me.  Yeah.  I don't pee until the next morning.  In fact, I can wake up with a piss boner and still fall asleep for another two hours with  it.  Just fight through it.  I'd rather sleep is more valuable to me.  How impressive are piss boners, by the way?  They're very excited.  You're like, fuck yeah.  Yeah, you want to show the world.  Look what this thing can still fucking do.  I wish I could with a little urine in it. 
[01:51:00]  If this thing didn't hurt so bad, I'd try to fuck somebody with it.  It's like a math class boner.  You think Gus and Elmer got married their aunt?  Gus and Elmer, were they in New York?  Or maybe one of those guys died.  Yeah, they were like real old school gay guys.  Our favorite gay couple ever was Gus and Elmer.  And the only thing I could ever think of is them growing up like during the war and things  and being together with it where they're just like, hey ladies, here's two eligible bachelors.  And just knowing like, oh yeah. 
[01:51:30]  The string of dates they went on that they knew were going nowhere.  That was just nowhere.  They went on double dates together just so they could be with each other.  During the old depression, you go wait in the bread line, I'll lube up the dildos.  Yeah, what are these two?  And they're always seen together.  That's right, ladies.  What a catch these two would make.  Fresh back from the war.  The war.  It's Gus and Elmer.  They're roommates for life.  Just not knowing or caring or wanting to say that they're gay. 
[01:52:00]  Was there a whole society that just didn't want to acknowledge gay people?  Yeah.  They weren't around.  We're living in it.  I mean, we've seen changes, obviously.  I'm going back to like, you know, our parents' generation stuff.  They had to know people walking around that were gay.  What did they do?  Just make believe that wasn't happening?  No, they pushed them into the priesthood.  You know what?  You're right.  No, I mean, I really believe that's true.  That like in a community where they're like, you know, the O'Grady boy seems a little light in the loafers. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Maybe we should push him towards the clergy.  Because they were so ashamed at the possibility of one of their kids being gay that they'd press him further into it and make them feel horrible and ashamed.  I really believe that a lot of that is true.  It's a great point, yeah.  But what if you weren't Catholic?  Like then, what did they matter?  The Jewish gay kids.  What did they do?  You married your mother.  I mean, Jewish mothers have created more homosexual men than I think.  Because no one's good enough for them. 
[01:53:00]  They're perfect.  I guess back then it was just one more thing to hide.  You were probably already hiding that you were Jewish from a lot of people.  You just pass on two of them.  I like cock, too.  Passing straight and nutty.  See, now I'm going to get flack for saying created.  Of course.  You're born with it, but sometimes there are other circumstances.  But when you walk around New York.  Hop it along, mommy.  When you walk around New York, you see all the gay people.  It's obvious, right?  For the most part.  Yeah.  Like what happened two generations ago?  Were guys and women just acting like. 
[01:53:30]  That's what I was called.  They were straight.  They got married.  No, dude.  I just watched.  You know what I'm saying?  It's horrible.  But you see some of these guys walking around.  You're like, there's no way he could have acted straight.  Dude, I just watched.  There's no way.  But, I mean, two generations ago, how did they do it?  They were beat up.  They were shunned.  They did everything they could to hide it.  A lot of them got married.  And then we talk about this.  Then you had someone like Liberace would go on the talk shows and they would always ask him,  when are you going to settle down and get a woman?  Yeah.  I'll find. 
[01:54:00]  Are you kidding me?  Even Regis would do that.  Right.  They all played along.  What are you going to do?  They all just played along with it?  Where's your wife already?  Why don't you settle down?  What's wrong with you?  Get married.  Right.  We're going to have Lee on the show.  And then it's like, Lee is coming out and he's all flamboyant.  It's like, you know, the ladies love Liberace.  He was on WrestleMania.  Oh, Christ.  First WrestleMania, Liberace, or the second one, Liberace is on it.  He's in the fucking ring, the wrestling ring with the Rockettes doing kicks. 
[01:54:30]  Kick line.  And wrestling fans were like, I like that Liberace.  He's a guy's guy.  How do you not like him?  He's a man's man.  Literally.  Kicking.  A man's man kicking with the Rockettes.  On Netflix, I just watched Life for Riley.  It was Charles Nelson Riley's one-man show.  Another one.  Another one.  Now, I swear to God, I turned this thing on, thinking it was going to be campy, funny,  fucking riveting, one of the best one-man shows I've ever seen.  Wow, really?  Laughed my balls off.  It's poignant, sad, hilarious. 
[01:55:00]  When was it done?  I loved it.  Like, 2006.  Right before he died.  So I looked him up online.  He talks about how he's gay in it.  And they said on Wikipedia, that fucking show was the first time he ever publicly announced  that he was gay.  Well, and that was four years ago.  Did he have to really announce it?  Yeah, it was like three years before he died.  He finally came out and said it.  It was like Paul Lind, like nobody ever talked about it.  Oh, that was hilarious.  Come on.  The thing is, like most people who watch that stuff, it's willful ignorance.  I mean, they kind of know, but all of a sudden when someone says, I suck cock, then they're 
[01:55:30]  like, oh, God, that guy sucks cock.  Before, he was just a funny guy.  But they knew anyways.  I think a lot of people have more trouble with the publicity or being public about it.  I think that would sort of speak to what you're saying.  Well, you don't want to think that Center Square is gay.  Paul Lind, you want him to be like, you know, I'm taking the cocksucker for the block.  Well, you just knew he was gay.  Right, and I think that speaks to what you're talking about.  That explains celebrity, but I was just wondering about just regular fucking Joes walking around. 
[01:56:00]  Well, they just, they hid it.  I'm not gay.  Just kidding.  Come on.  Come on, that was cheap.  Sorry.  I couldn't resist.  It's like, it's a tough life.  I mean, you know, and that's the weird thing about people who say they choose it.  It's like, why would they choose that?  In a sense, and I'm not meaning that in a negative way, but it's not the easy path.  No.  Who wants to choose the horrible path?  Or what seems to be.  Difficult.  It's difficult, we should say.  I think there are two types of gay people.  There are ones that are born gay, and then there's a few, like, wannabes. 
[01:56:30]  That's called college.  Is it college?  The confusing time.  Drunk, a little too drunk.  Where's that wannabe come from, though?  Maybe that's already in yet.  I don't know.  It's like anybody else.  They have a great time.  Are you kidding me?  There's a society of people that you want to be part of.  These are grown people that still enjoy dancing.  Why wouldn't you want to be part of that?  They've got a lot of disposable income.  They wear nice clothing.  I'm generalizing, but I think these are relatively effective generalization. 
[01:57:00]  There's a gay bar in my neighborhood, and I pass it every time I walk to Bobby Kelly's house.  You can't even admit you probably went in there to check it out.  Opie, I want to go in so bad.  They look like they're having the greatest fun.  I think Bobby even does a bit about this on stage, but I think it's the same.  It looks like they're the...  I'm literally standing outside of that thing like fucking Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places  in the Santa Claus suit, just fucking looking in like, that looks like the best.  That's funny, because being straight is like wearing a Santa Claus suit to them. 
[01:57:30]  What is that guy wearing?  Who would walk around like that?  And Bobby does a bit on it, huh?  I think Bobby does a bit about that gay bar.  Oh, a bit.  I'm sure Bobby's doing...  That means his wife caught him in there.  He's like, no, man, I'm just getting a bit together.  Now he has to do the bit for the next 10 years.  Bobby Kelly would be a great gay guy.  Oh, he would.  The best gay guy.  Because he did most of the way there, I think, isn't he?  He's pretty far there.  You kissed Bobby. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I did.  You did?  Yeah, yeah.  How was that?  Sam had kissed Bobby.  Well, Sam has kissed many guys.  Where does Bobby...  How many?  Like tongue?  I mean tongue.  No tongue.  Oh.  Sam has kissed three guys.  Homeless guy.  Homeless guy.  So where does Bobby write?  Homeless guy?  Yeah.  Just because?  Well, no, it was for a failed TV pilot.  Make a wish.  Make a wish.  Was that worth it?  A failed TV pilot.  The twink kisses the gay guy.  You decided to take a shot at us right there.  What do you mean?  We were the failed TV pilot.  Oh, I forgot.  I forgot. 
[01:58:30]  Comedy Central with the worst idea ever.  It was no idea.  Really?  Which one was that?  We had a no idea.  We got involved with a no idea.  Yeah.  We do that every time.  What does that mean?  Every time somebody...  They sign it for a few bucks.  Yeah.  And they go, yeah, go ahead.  You guys do a funny radio show.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, try it.  Be funny.  Do something.  With no money.  With no money.  Do it.  Well, what's the gist of this?  Nah, don't worry about it.  Yeah.  It was...  Did you shoot something?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The producer.  The guy... 
[01:59:00]  The main guy, Concentral, ended up getting fired, I think, over us.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  He left soon after.  I was there when you guys were taping.  He showed up at one of the tapings and wouldn't even talk to me in an air.  And I'm like, oh, boy.  It was horrible.  He realizes there was nothing going on.  It was stupid.  Hated that.  It was literally not an idea.  Just walking around, just going, what is this?  I don't get this.  Wasn't it like Keith Robinson had to kickbox Voss or something like that?  Oh, right.  Yeah, I guess so.  And that sounds entertaining, actually.  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  I would have liked to have seen it, though.  We're getting comics to do kind of like jackass slash fear factor type things.  Fear factor type things.  It made no sense.  And then they would get points, and then you would have a winner by the end of the episode.  But the winner got, I don't know, nothing, really.  Yeah.  It was the dumbest fucking thing in America.  If there wasn't a real pride.  Games that don't pay off, they don't like it.  I hosted it.  I'm so glad it didn't work out.  I hosted that horrible show.  And then you learn comics don't really want to do anything. 
[02:00:00]  No, I knew that.  No, to humiliate them.  I was like, why am I going to fucking eat this big snot?  Aren't we doing enough?  Yeah.  No, I understand.  I'm not even trashed with you guys, but it's commie central.  They should have known.  So half the time I was trying to convince these guys to do stuff that they were never going to fucking do.  I hosted it, like I did, they, when VH1 was trying to retool itself, and they had Zach as the poster boy, Galvanakis, remember there was about a year there where he was on every bus with the silly hat and everything.  They had, I had signed a deal, that was after my first divorce, I was broke. 
[02:00:30]  So I signed a deal to host this, Nevermind the Buzzcocks, which was a popular British show, which is basically a pseudo game show with improvising and sort of B-list celebrities and whatnot.  I had no idea, you know, I couldn't, I don't have enough compartmentalization ability to host a fucking game show.  I didn't know what the game was.  I, you know, I wasn't that into music in the trivia sense, certainly not modern music.  But the thing, the point I was making is that it was sort of a game show, and comics would come on and like some musical people, but there was no prize. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And like in America, if you're watching a game show, someone better win something.  Yeah.  Or it doesn't make sense.  Or not win something.  Right.  You know, either or, it's fine.  I'm so glad it didn't go over.  I mean, literally no one saw it.  It went away.  They didn't even run all the episodes.  I got, I got out of the bankruptcy and I was like, thank God.  Well, what?  Thank God.  What happened at the end of the show when the winner was declared?  I don't remember anything.  I mean, there was, there was like a, each side had an improv person.  It was Matt Price and, I forget, Brogdon something, I can't remember her first name. 
[02:01:30]  So they were regulars.  And then you get somebody like Coolio and Burt Kreischer on one side, and then you have Sebastian Bach and another, and Mo, what's his name, Mo, what's the commentary?  Mo Rocca.  Mo Rocca.  Yeah, so then you do these trivia questions and improv games, and then they declare a winner, and that'd be the end of it.  But I, I couldn't, it was horrible.  Yeah.  The loser has to listen to Coolio and Sebastian Bach perform. 
[02:02:00]  I think if you look up VH1, never mind the Buzzcocks, there's still like a promotional page for the show.  Yeah, I was emaciated.  Oh my God, look at that.  Wow.  What year is that?  Meet the host.  What year was that?  19, no, 2000 maybe, 2001?  Yeah.  There it is, Daphne Brogdon, that was the other one.  Matt Price is a funny kid.  He's on, that was sad that that show got canceled, Men of a Certain Age.  What a, what a fucking great show.  That show got canceled?  I don't know.  The Ray Romano show?  Yeah, it was great.  It did?  Yes.  When?  Just now. 
[02:02:30]  It just happened in my head.  They just were advertising the second.  I just canceled it.  They were just advertising the second season.  I know, they didn't renew it.  Oh, I didn't know.  It's so sad because it was such a great show, man.  That's a bummer.  We should, we should break here.  So we got Mark Maron.  What are we promoting?  Obviously, what the fuck podcast, WTF.  Yeah, I mean.  Where do they go for the podcast?  They go to WTFpod.com.  That's good.  The most recent 50 are up there.  You know, you got your, the Conan, the Fallon, the, you know, I think Jonathan Winters is  definitely still up.  You can get the app and get all of them if you want. 
[02:03:00]  I know I'm going to ask you about after the break Gallagher.  Okay.  We've had some good times with Gallagher.  Yeah.  We'll get into it after the break.  He's a baby.  Yeah, there's some issues there.  Anything else you're promoting?  That's it?  Yeah, no, the WTFpod.com.  That's a biggie.  Yeah, I'm going to Montreal this week.  I'm doing two shows at the Bell House Live, WTFs, but they're sold out, so next time.  What a great life.  And Joe, what do you got, brother?  Montreal as well this week. 
[02:03:30]  Burr and me and Bobby Kelly are doing Cheat Live at Cafe Cleopatra.  It's starting tomorrow night, 1030.  Yeah, you don't have to.  Those shows will do just fine.  All right.  More with these guys.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right.  Now settle down.  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going to go to funny land.  He's back with an all-new CD. 
[02:04:00]  Where are we going?  What a termite's he for breakfast.  Oh, what, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Here we go.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Buckford.  Rock me.  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right.  What's Mary short for? 
[02:04:30]  She's got no legs.  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman.  And his all-new CD.  Where are we going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the O.B. Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  We're hanging with Mark Maron and Joe DeRosa.  Joe's flying by today.  Yeah.  My God.  Ooh, Little Faith No More.  Yeah.  Ah, right.  That's for you, Joe.  Trust me.  That's for you.  So, Big Faith No More fan right there.  Yeah.  Any Amy Winehouse fans, by the way?  I like that record.  We haven't really talked about her.  I mean, I don't know how many records she did, but the big one I liked.  I thought she was great.  Yeah.  Her big hit.  Yeah.  Her big hit album. 
[02:05:30]  No, I liked her.  It's a sad thing when anyone dies like that.  That's such a young age.  Yeah, it's a waste.  I wasn't into her, but she was really talented.  Such a young age.  It's a good sound.  You know, I like that everybody just knows when it's coming.  Yeah, that's the weird thing.  It's no surprise.  Yeah, but people write about it.  Like, the papers, especially the English media.  Yeah.  With those rag papers that they got.  Just constantly following her and saying, wow, look how fucked up she is and everything.  And then when she dies, it's like, oh, well, way before her time should have been. 
[02:06:00]  It's like, you're the one that's just following her around, counting how many drugs.  I think Rupert Murdoch killed her.  Just to get some of the heat off of them for a little while.  Yeah, they really act like they had nothing to do with it.  Remember when Britney Spears collapsed in L.A.?  Yeah, yeah.  I was in L.A. when that happened.  And they were literally that day following her around and announcing her location to location on the radio.  And then they come out and go, we don't know why she collapsed.  Yeah, we have no idea.  She was running from them?  Yeah, exactly.  There's the video of them taking out the body, actually. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, God.  But she didn't die way before her time.  I'm surprised she made it to 27.  Well, that's the sad thing that people I don't think really talk about enough of.  Is that, you know, if you're fucked up like that, if you're strung out like that, if you have that, the bug that bad, alcoholism or drug addiction, nothing, no one can stop you.  Nah.  No one can stop you.  It's the saddest thing in the world that it's like, because in your mind, you're like, can't look at yourself.  Can't you just stop it?  It's a fucking sickness.  And nobody can stop you but yourself.  Yeah.  Your willingness to do it.  It's tragic.  It's a very unfair burden because it's like, you know, look, Ant, you care for a drink now and again. 
[02:07:00]  I like to imbibe.  I love how you just sugarcoated that joke.  I think you had a few drinks with Anthony this past Friday night.  I was out alone until three in the morning on Friday night.  That felt good.  By the way, yeah, we went out drinking and then we got pizza.  I ate.  My pizza was gone by the time I walked the two blocks home.  Oh, the two blocks home.  How many?  What, a slice?  Two slices.  But I'm just walking drunk, fucking zigzagging, shoving pizza. 
[02:07:30]  It was a sad sight.  He was that guy just shoving pizza down his throat.  Can he keep up with you, Ant?  Joe?  Please.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Joe?  He keeps right up.  The worst thing about him.  But the point, oh, wait, real quick, real quick.  The point is that.  No, take your time.  It's.  The point is, is that, yeah, I like to drink.  A lot of guys like to drink.  I feel really sorry for guys where it's like you have one beer and eventually, whether it's  a matter of hours or days, your fucking life will be in sham. 
[02:08:00]  Feed the monster.  It's just, something's going to fuck up.  Yeah, you woke up the monster.  You woke up the monster.  No, I mean, I haven't, I'm coming up on 12 years sober.  And, you know, I went to a concert the other night with a girl.  I went to, someone got me tickets to Soundgarden.  And some dude next to me, yeah, because I really don't think about it much.  I mean, the whole obsession to drink and do drugs has sort of left me.  Right.  I'm at a concert.  Yeah, she doesn't really want to be there.  It's like an old rock cock concert.  I'm like, I got free tickets.  I love Soundgarden.  So I'm there. 
[02:08:30]  The guy next to me politely taps me on the shoulder.  He goes, you might have a smoke.  And I'm like, nah, go ahead.  And he's smoking this joint.  And I feel it wafting over.  And I'm like, I'm not doing anything wrong.  Just standing here.  I'm not doing anything wrong.  I'm not doing anything wrong.  I'm all right.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Oh, shit.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  But, uh, pot smoke smells.  That's so fucking good.  I know.  I don't smoke pot when it's around.  I have skunks in my yard.  I have skunks in my yard.  And some part of my brain's like, this ain't bad. 
[02:09:00]  That smells not bad.  Was it you that tweeted that Chris Cornell was one of the greatest rock voices ever?  I did.  That was you, right?  I got a little flack for that.  But you know what?  I didn't disagree with that.  Well, the thing, I'm a bit, I love rock music.  Hey, you're a rocker.  Russ Meneve actually said that to me.  I said, I used the phrase rock and roll in the sentence.  He goes, who still says rock and roll?  Yeah.  But, uh.  Rock and roll.  I like to rock around McClark.  Name your music choices just so we know where you're coming from. 
[02:09:30]  I come from a lot of places.  I mean, uh.  Fair enough.  Like with Chris Cornell and with Soundgarden, the thing that was weird about going to the  show is I used to listen to them in the early 90s when they were on Sub Pop.  So the girl I'm dating, she was like, well, they were kind of like, you know, kind of  jock rock when I was a kid.  So she came in at the big, two big albums, but I was there for the first three or whatever.  Right.  And they played songs from those.  Like, I don't listen to them much anymore.  But when I was in the concert, I was like, I was amazed at how much of that shit I knew.  And the thing that amazed me the most was that his voice sounds great.  Yeah.  And I realized, I was just being a fanboy, and I was like, holy shit, I could listen 
[02:10:00]  to that guy sing anything.  And that's when someone tweeted that he was one of the best rock singers.  And I agreed because there's very few guys that can do that, that you just want to hear  sing.  Yeah.  And when you take away all the instruments and stuff and just hear his voice?  It's amazing.  And they're pretty stripped down.  There wasn't much of a show.  They were just dudes playing.  And I like seeing that.  Like, you know, no one dressed up.  You know the song Seasons He did, right?  I'm not sure if I know that.  Oh, wow.  Is it great?  It's from the single soundtrack?  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  I don't even know if he did it officially with Soundgarden or not.  It's pretty...  Yeah, it's stripped down, man.  It's mostly just him.  You got that?  Just a little taste?  It's pretty effortless, what he does.  I think it's Seasons, right, Ant?  Do you remember that song?  No.  That single soundtrack was amazing.  I just...  You know, there's a lot of great rock singers.  Whenever you get into that dialogue of, like, who's the best and whatever, it's, like,  ridiculous.  Well, who else would you put on that list?  Greatest rock singers?  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of guys that are great.  I mean, Joe Cocker was pretty great in his prime.  Robert Plant was pretty great in his time.  Paul Rogers from Bad Company early on was great.  I like Paul Rogers. 
[02:11:00]  Great.  Yeah.  Eddie Vedder's got a great voice.  I love Eddie Vedder.  And then there are the blues guys.  I think Mercury takes the cake, though.  Yeah, Mercury.  I really do.  I never listen to a lot of Queen, though.  Listen to Chris Cornell when it's just stripped down and pretty much him and an acoustic guitar.  It's just a piece.  He's got great range is what it is, too.  He's just going to remind me of something sad.  I remember when I was young and I hit this girl.  It was about ready to come.  I remember this from the movie.  Yeah, the song. 
[02:11:30]  I don't remember this movie.  I love this movie.  The song Radio just blew off.  Did that?  Yeah.  Here he comes, right?  I feel it.  I like that we're all just listening to a song.  I know.  Yeah, it's great.  We don't have ratings here.  Who cares?  We'll play the whole fucking album if we want to.  And Chris will get a check from SoundExchange.  Yeah, give him a few more bucks. 
[02:12:00]  It's going to kick in, right?  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel it.  Yeah, he's got to bring it on home.  Are you going to like it when it's this mellow?  No, it's too mellow.  So wait, it's like driving a Ferrari at fucking 30 miles an hour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need him fucking.  Aaron Lewis is coming in.  His vocal's up.  From Stained.  I love Aaron Lewis' voice.  Yeah, I, uh.  Did you like Lee Staley?  I don't know who was that.  Alice in Chains? 
[02:12:30]  I didn't listen to them a lot.  He's already.  I got some blind spots with the music.  Lane Staley's all right, but Lane Staley, there's a difference, I think, between frontman and  vocalists, and then the guys that can do both.  You know what I mean?  It's like David Lee Roth and Lane Staley I put in frontman category.  They front the band well, and they have a very good, distinct, unique voice, but they  don't have anywhere near the capability of a Chris Cornell or Freddie Mercury.  Well, there's a difference between that.  Or versatility, you know?  Yeah, that unique thing versus, like, real chop, real, like, real pipes. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You are.  You are going to catch so much fucking hell for saying that.  Really?  I just know.  What did I say bad?  That Lane Staley doesn't have that.  You kind of put him in the same category as David Lee Roth.  Vocally?  No, no, no, no, no.  What am I saying is...  What am I saying is...  ...note?  Okay.  Mark Lanigan was good, too.  Have you ever heard of him?  Fucking love Mark Lanigan.  So underrated.  And fucking, like, the rooster, when he fucking really gets up there.  Lane Staley is the best guy...  Iggy Pop's a great singer.  Lane Staley's the best guy ever at going like this. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  God help your Twitter account.  God help your Twitter account.  I'm sure that's going to help you say that.  I'm going to get hate tweets all week from the shit I said on Fox.  Oh, believe me.  Here we go.  They were going to double it up with this.  He died of dope, too, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He died very alone.  They found him, like...  I forgot how long.  He shut out so many people that he was laying there for a while. 
[02:14:00]  It would be like his cat who was eating him or something, right?  Yes.  Just about.  Just about.  His cat was going...  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Just nibbling on his kneecap.  Yeah.  That's the worst part.  By the way, I made a lot of jokes about Amy Winehouse over the weekend, and I'm right  there with the Lane Staley jokes, and I love Lane Staley, so relax, everybody.  You got to joke about this shit.  What joke did you make about Amy?  I was afraid to make a joke about her, because I honestly got that feeling of, like, ah, it's 
[02:14:30]  too soon.  I got to let this shit for a minute.  Yeah, but that's how it used to be, but now with Twitter, people are like, fuck that  too soon shit.  I got to get my stuff out there immediately.  Twitter has thoroughly killed anyone's ability to be empathetic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's awful.  There's no need for human feelings in the world of Twitter.  You could read the first announcement and go, holy shit, Amy Winehouse is dead.  Amy Winehouse joke will be, like, the next fucking line, and it's like, it doesn't give  you time to kind of wait and then go, hey, I got a joke.  There was an unwritten rule, but not anymore, not with this social network. 
[02:15:00]  You got to get this shit out.  Yeah.  If you're going to go down that road is what I'm saying.  Well, no, no.  I mean, people do it, but I think that we get caught up in the pace of the way the social  networking thing goes, and we really forget that, like, hey, there's a person and a family  connected to this.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that some people are genuinely hurt, but when you're sitting there just looking  at your Twitter feed, no, you didn't know her, but you're a person.  I didn't know her. 
[02:15:30]  I didn't fucking know her.  Fuck that bitch.  You do make a good point, though.  No, but I understand it.  I mean, I've made my own mistakes with that.  I mean, you got to fight the urge, but there are times, well, the thing I was going to say  about drug addiction, here's the fucked up thing, is like, if you guys, like, you drink  or you get fucked up, you eat pizza or whatever, but the saddest moment that I remember  about doing coke, is that, you know, I'd go down to, like, you know, B, Avenue B, I'd  go to this guy's house, I'd score the coke, and this is how you know you're a fucked up  drug addict, is when the bar is closing, you're coked up, and you're at a bar where there's 
[02:16:00]  literally just you and some other guy at the end of the bar, and it's four in the morning,  and you're thinking something's going to happen.  It's like, this shit's going to turn around.  Oh, yeah.  You know, like, the party's about to start.  This thing's going to turn around.  That's when, you know, like, I am lost.  You just scared me in there.  What year were you going down to the avenues?  That's the Lower East Side, man.  Yeah.  Well, no, this guy ran sort of a coke salon.  It was not, I wasn't on the street. 
[02:16:30]  You know, you went up to his house.  They sort of cleaned up those areas.  People be hanging out, and, you know, he was one of those guys that he put coke out for  everybody, but it was kind of stepped on, but it kept people around.  You know what I mean?  It was like a little party.  It kept the party going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I used to do coke when I was in Geneseo, but it had to be stepped on so much that I don't  think I officially ever did coke.  You know what the funny thing is?  I'm not even joking.  What kind of coke were we getting at a state school in upstate New York?  I was at this guy's house.  I used to be the early bird because I was married at the time, and I had this thing in 
[02:17:00]  my head where I'm like, if I get my coke in early, I can get home and go to bed,  and she won't know.  So I would be calling the guy at like 5.30 in the afternoon, and the sun wasn't even  down.  So I'd be like the first guy at the house, and he's still closing the blinds.  And I was there once when this weird little Latino dude who looked like he was 100 showed  up with a ball wrapped in tinfoil to give to the guy.  So I was there when the stuff came.  I've actually made delivery, yeah.  So I'm sitting there, and then I'm like, we'll put some of that out. 
[02:17:30]  And the guy's like, all right.  So he shaves a little off this rock.  He puts it out.  I do two lines.  I felt something I'd never felt in my life.  I could feel all of my brain cells just peel back.  And I literally felt God's cock in my head.  And I say to the guy, I say like, Jesus, why don't you sell that?  And he looks at me, he goes, because people would never leave me alone.  You got to step on it just to fucking, yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Just like all the rest of the shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Just like all the rest of the stuff out here.  I remember I was in Alabama one time.  And this fucking, this chick, I had plans with this chick after the show.  And she comes in.  She comes in with this other girl and this guy.  And she's like, look.  She was supposed to hang out with me at the hotel.  She's like, look, we got to go.  This guy's got to make a Coke deal.  So I'm like, all right.  She goes, I'm going to leave and come back.  And I'm like, no, you're not.  I'm going to come with you because you're not going to come back.  I ended up in her fucking trailer. 
[02:18:30]  I'm not exaggerating.  Her trailer in the woods in Alabama and Birmingham.  And they break out all this Coke and they're doing lines.  They're like, do you want any?  Do you want any?  I'm like, no, no, no, no.  I'm good.  Then I'm like, eh, all right.  And then just like you said, you think it's going to turn around.  Flash forward, it's 7 a.m.  Oh, and you're still in a trailer.  I'm in the trailer, in the kitchenette of the trailer with the dealer.  And we're screaming at each other how we're the only two people that understood how brilliant 
[02:19:00]  Star Wars episode one was.  Just waiting to fuck this girl.  I'm going to fuck her.  8 a.m., 9 a.m.  It's going to come.  Something's going to happen.  She's going to come out and say, yeah.  And then all you end up doing is jerking off to save your life.  It's like, you know, you're sitting there like your heart's pounding.  Like, I don't want to die.  Maybe I'll jerk off for four hours.  See how that goes.  And then the sun comes up and you've barely...  I tried to go to sleep in her bed.  She had a kid, but the kid wasn't there.  Oh, this keeps getting better.  Yeah.  Wow.  How old was the kid? 
[02:19:30]  The kid was like four.  The kid was at her dad's.  I tried to go to sleep in her bed.  You know when you get like the Coke chills?  Like you're cold?  Yeah.  And I'm in her bed and I'm all cold.  I'm just grinding my fucking teeth.  You're in a little bed in a trailer.  This is horrible.  I'm in the chick's bed.  This is terrible.  And I'm like, I got to put something on the TV, you know?  Yeah.  And I found a videotape of the secret of Mim that was her daughter's.  And I put it on.  I'm like, I remember this movie.  This is good.  This is going to calm me down.  Yeah.  Calm down. 
[02:20:00]  Calm down.  Dude, it was so bad.  And you get, you know, when you get back and you're like, well, my first show's at eight.  If I go to bed now, I can get six hours of sleep.  Oh my God.  I had a night in New York that was, I still don't know what happened.  I was doing comedy.  I don't know what happened.  And it scares me because I remember I was, I was married.  I was living on with my first wife on 16th street.  I go out to do comedy.  I'm drinking still.  Then I knocked back a couple of Bacas and there was this couple at the bar in my memory.  They look like Boris and Natasha, you know, the cartoon. 
[02:20:30]  Like there was something fucked up.  There was something wrong.  And the dude says, you want some blow?  I go, yeah.  So I do some blow.  The next thing I remember, there's just bits and pieces of me ending up in an apartment.  You know, there was more than one person involved.  And like, you know, I don't like, I wake up and like all of a sudden I'm getting out  of a cab and Natasha is like, you know, saying, you know, she's putting me in a cab and I  get home to my wife and I'm, and I'm like, I don't know what happened.  And she goes, why is your shirt on backwards?  And I'm like, oh, what happened?  You know, and then, and then she plays a message for me that I, apparently I called 
[02:21:00]  and left a message and it, she said, what I, this is what I had to deal with.  I didn't know where you were.  And, and she played the message and it was me saying, I'll be home as soon as I get out  of this dream.  Jesus Christ.  I have no idea what happened to that night.  And I'm not sure I want to.  Jesus Christ.  Best leave it blocked out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There was no scars.  My ass didn't hurt.  And there was, I didn't know.  So I'm not, I'm not sure what went down. 
[02:21:30]  The shirt was off at some point.  That's it.  That's something, you know, back in the day when you had a good time and you didn't remember  it, somebody had a good time.  That's the thing with, uh, with blow too.  It's like, I do think it's a certain personality that gets addicted to anything.  And I don't think that blow has that evil addictive quality that the commercials in the  eighties made you think.  I'll argue that one with you.  I will argue that with you.  But I think a lot of guys can do it.  Well, doesn't have an addictive quality.  No, no, no. 
[02:22:00]  That's going to be doctor.  I want some now.  Dr. DeRosa.  I want some now.  All right.  Before everybody jumps on me.  Mark, it's safe.  Just do it, dude.  It's fine.  Come on.  What I'm saying is, is like every commercial in the eighties made you think if you did  it once, you were addicted.  And that was it.  And it's like, it's clearly not like that.  It's like, there are guys that do it once every six months and they're fine.  But I think the, I think the, or liars.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  I think the addictive quality of it every time with everybody is it's like you're saying, 
[02:22:30]  it's like you do it and you can't get enough that night.  It's not about the next day.  It's that night.  No, I always left a line for the morning.  Like I knew I wouldn't, I knew I wasn't going to get much sleep.  That's crazy.  That's impossible.  It is impossible.  No, but when I worked at a restaurant, I used to work at a breakfast shift at a restaurant  when I was in college.  And I knew that if I did well the night before that, I was going to sleep like two hours.  And if I didn't leave myself two good bumps to get up to, you know, to get to the grill.  How could anyone do that?  That's impossible.  Like the whole night of, you do a line, the first line you fucking do, you're like, the 
[02:23:00]  whole night becomes dedicated to getting more coke.  Your throat's getting tight.  That's what I'm saying.  More coke.  I'm getting a drip now.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just like, now I need more.  Yeah.  More, more, more.  And you'd never feel like you did when you, the first of the night either.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I try.  Somehow or another, I managed to, like, I was never, not until later when I, that was  this, this fucked up thing about when I was married, the first wife, you know, she knew  I had a drug problem. 
[02:23:30]  I was trying to get off stuff.  And, and what, what would happen was I couldn't do it around her ever.  So when I'd go to LA or something, it was like, forget it, man.  Make up a lost time.  Oh yeah.  Now I'd be, you'd end up with, in hotel rooms with, with, with pirates and gypsies.  You know, okay, you're like, you know, where the fucking thing comes from?  Grinding your teeth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hide my wallet.  Yeah.  How long are we going to be at this for a while?  Yeah.  Like I did.  Like one time I was on, I think I was on Wellbutrin to quit smoking and I got all gacked  up on coke and my arm started to curl up.  Like I had palsy.  And I'm like, whoa, man, I better stop. 
[02:24:00]  This doesn't look good.  I couldn't undo my hand.  Jesus Christ.  You know, so, so that's when it gets a little scary when you're doing it with that much passion.  You end up in places where it's just crazy.  Like you end up in, like, I remember going to score some coke with this guy.  You always, I knew a guy that, like, I never was the guy that would go out into the darkness  to find it.  You needed the guy.  You needed the intermediary between, you know, like the good place and fucking hell.  Yeah.  Like, you know, here's 500 bucks.  Yeah.  Right.  I once paid a guy $500 to not fuck me on coke deals. 
[02:24:30]  Cause I said, look, I said, look, I'm not, I don't come to LA that often.  Here's $500.  Just keep that.  So you don't burn me.  Yeah.  And he fucking burned me, dude.  I, oh God, here I go.  What a bastard.  I'm going, I go to like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gacked up, right?  I got, I got some coke.  Well, what happened was it ended up being speed.  I was in LA with this guy, Bob, and he hooked up.  He said, I don't think it's coke, but it's working.  I'm like, all right.  So, so I think it was crank.  So anyways, I ended up going to Minneapolis, you know, to do a weekend at the club.  I was going to ask, did you have to, or did you just end up going there? 
[02:25:00]  I love those stories.  Yeah.  It was a, it was a, it was a pretty, it was a good club, but I ran out of this shit.  So I didn't know where to get it.  Right.  So I, I, I called that guy.  I said, well, you FedEx me an eight ball.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  So he goes, can you please commit even more of a federal offense?  Right.  So I fed, I, I FedExed him like however much, 250, 300 bucks.  And he says, I'm on it.  And then he calls me up.  He says, all right, it's coming.  Here's the confirmation number.  I put it in a videotape and I stuck it in like one of the holes of the videotape and it's 
[02:25:30]  in a package and he gives me a confirmation number.  Right.  So of course, like I'm up the next morning at the club where I'm having it delivered,  the FedEx, waiting for the FedEx truck.  You know?  So the guy, like this goes on for two days.  I go to the club the first day and I'm like, was there a FedEx for me?  And they're at the club.  They're like, no, I didn't get anything.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And the next day I'm back at the club and literally the FedEx truck, you know, like  it comes up and I'm like, is there a FedEx for me?  And the guy's like, sir, get off the truck. 
[02:26:00]  Jesus.  And he fucking burned me.  The ice cream man, you motherfucker.  Get away from me.  But he, he, that's what Coke will do to you.  He created this whole story about a videotape, a confirmation number.  Yeah.  But so he did fuck me.  I can't imagine you on Coke.  Huh?  Jesus.  I can't imagine.  Crazy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Climbing up lampposts and shit.  It just made me feel clear.  Well, I love it.  It's a certain clarity to it.  I love that you got the, uh, the middleman thing.  Cause it's like, I've always been like, like I've bought drugs. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, but when some, when I meet somebody and they sell drugs, I'll trash them, you  know, behind their back, of course.  Of course.  And I'll go, fucking idiot.  He's a drug dealer.  Fuck that guy.  He's a moron.  And people will go, people will go, yeah, but you do drugs sometimes.  Like, why would you, how could, and I go, yeah, but I also eat at McDonald's.  If you worked at McDonald's, I think you were a fucking loser too.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, it's like that goodwill hunting.  Like what's the matter with laying brick?  Nothing.  But you, you could do more than that.  You know what I mean?  Most guys dealing are capable of doing more than that. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Now give me my eight ball.  Yeah.  Give me my fucking drugs.  You're a genius.  You should really be doing something else.  Do you got this shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There, here come more hate tweets from the angry drug dealers now.  Hate tweets from drug dealers.  Don't take it too personally.  Well, the Allison Chains was a little too far, Joe.  Oh boy.  A little too far.  That's what I do.  You know, I walk the line.  Well, why'd you mention David Lee Roth in the same sentence?  All I was saying was, Allison, Lane Stanley cannot do what Freddie Mercury did as far as  versatility.  Freddie Mercury would sing a fucking ragtime song and then sing Bohemian Rhapsody and then 
[02:27:30]  sing Sheer Heart Attack.  It's like.  But we all just wanted to hear Bohemian Rhapsody.  Come on.  Stone Cold Crazy?  Actually, I did.  Come on.  He had a great voice.  I just didn't listen to him much.  Yeah.  I liked Queen, I guess.  Yeah.  More or less.  I didn't get too deep with those guys.  Well, I'm not worked up.  Yeah.  I know.  You get all like, you start thinking about it and remembering.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  It is sort of horrible.  Do you miss it? 
[02:28:00]  Huh?  You miss it?  No, I don't miss Coke at all.  I don't miss booze at all.  I miss pot more than anything else.  I mean, pot was easy.  Do you wake up as an older gentleman?  Older.  Yeah.  And go, holy shit, I can't believe I'm alive.  Did you start thinking about some of the shit that you just.  Yeah.  And I think that's better than saying, fuck, I'm alive.  You know?  I can't believe I'm alive is really a big progress.  You don't even think twice about the chances you take as a younger guy.  Well, that's the thing about drugs.  The thing about drugs is that as soon as you enter that world, you've exponentially amplified  the possibility of you getting killed for some reason. 
[02:28:30]  Not just drugs.  Yes.  You're on the wrong end of a deal.  You catch a straight bullet.  You're in a bad neighborhood.  You're behind the wheel of a car.  Drug driving.  All that shit.  You just amplify.  But that's what I'm saying.  And now you almost value your life.  No, I definitely.  So you wake up every once in a while like, holy fuck, I was really taking some crazy fucking  chances.  Oh, yeah.  But not even thinking twice about it back then.  No, no.  Yeah.  Just I remember when I lived in Boston and they at Catch Rising Star, they used to let  the comics drink for free.  So everybody would be barreling back from every one night or all over the New England area 
[02:29:00]  to just get fucked up by, you know, you got there before two.  Right.  And the type of shit that used to go, I mean, I wrecked the car once in the middle of the  night, drunk as shit.  And I lucked out.  I mean, I lucked out.  I was driving this woman home back to my house and I was fighting with her.  It was like three in the morning.  I was drunk.  I was coked up.  We were fighting about nothing.  And I did that thing where I'm like, fuck you.  I'm bringing you home.  I swung a U-turn.  I didn't navigate it properly.  And I just slammed into a parked car, knocked it up onto the sidewalk. 
[02:29:30]  We're literally two blocks from my house.  And I'm saying, I got to get the fuck out of here.  So I put it in reverse and clearly the car's like, there's smoke coming out of it.  And I'm like, we got to get the fuck out of here.  I'm wasted.  And then I'd see people coming out in bathrobes.  It was like the end of a musical.  It was like all of a sudden, the stage is just people in bathrobes going, what's happening?  And I'm like, fuck, fuck.  And then I'm like, I'm trying to pull around the corner.  And then I'm surrounded by cop cars.  And like this woman's sober.  And I'm on the, you know, the car's fucking wrecked.  And I'm doing the sobriety test. 
[02:30:00]  And they're like, where are you going?  I'm like, I was going to go park it at home and call you guys.  I'm like, well, the accident happened over there.  And I'm like, I know, but I just needed to get home to call you guys.  And I'm shit-faced.  And then this miracle happened.  There was like three cop cars.  The cops are surrounding me.  A cop out of nowhere pulls up and goes, someone's robbing the bakery.  And like a bunch of 10-year-olds, all these cops are like, can we go?  So the guy looks at me and he says, I'm going to give you a ticket for leaving the scene of property damage.  You know, you deal with it.  And they all took off.  And I was like, oh, can you drive it home, he said. 
[02:30:30]  Can you drive it home?  I'm like, I'm trying to drive it home.  I'll push it home.  Wow.  That is a luck out.  The car was towed.  Those were the days.  Yeah, they don't do that anymore.  Never, dude.  Big risks.  I think people have gotten better with the...  At drinking and driving?  At drinking and driving.  I think people are very afraid of it these days because I remember driving home drunk.  No, driving home or you wake up early on Saturday or Sunday morning and you drive down the expressway. 
[02:31:00]  And there would be cars just pulled over on the side of the expressway.  Yeah.  And they were all the people that got arrested the night before.  They were like, what happened?  People are abandoning their cars.  Or some of those guys, they never even arrested you.  They just said, you're leaving this fucking car.  Or I'm driving you home or you've got to find someone else to drive you home.  That's a good car.  They didn't always arrest everybody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm serious.  But there are a lot more of those cars on the side of the road in the older days.  I'm way more worried about the texting people.  You know what?  That's more dangerous. 
[02:31:30]  Dude, I finally turned the corner.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I mean, look, there's a point where you're so drunk that you are just going to fucking kill somebody.  Right.  But most people, if they're over the legal limit but not completely fucked up,  it's safer than if you're texting.  Well, yeah, because at least when you're drunk driving...  You're trying to see the road.  Well, someone's driving.  You're trying to see the road.  Yeah, someone's driving the car.  Yeah, someone's looking.  Do not know how blurry it is.  Yeah, when you're texting, no one's fucking driving the car.  No one's driving.  Your car's just alone.  You're like, holy fuck! 
[02:32:00]  How long is my car driving itself?  It's amazing.  An uncirited missile.  You try to squeeze out that one word that's a little long.  Yeah, what are you risking your life and the life of others to say, like, fuck you, soy milk is so...  Holy shit!  Right, right.  Just swerving all over the fucking ass.  Yeah, I hold it up and just block...  I hold it up like this, and I'm blocking one of my eyes with the text.  And I'm like, well, I've got one eye on the road.  I'm good.  As long as I'm not looking down.  I do it.  I have heard Lane Staley before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he...  That'll be you driving...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Responding to tweets.  I'm bad at it.  I can't get my head out of my fucking phone.  I mean, I...  I'm trying to get better.  It's a constant...  Yeah, I haven't checked my head.  I think we're all losing the battle, though.  It really is odd.  Where the fuck was I?  I saw old people...  Oh, I was at a playground with my kid over the weekend, and the grandparents were there  all on their fucking phones.  I thought it was just a young...  They got them, too, now.  Younger's the oddest thing.  But even the older people are fucking stuck in their phones.  You think of the old days, and it's like, what the fuck did you do? 
[02:33:00]  Oh, talk?  We're all losing the battle.  What the fuck did you do with the...  You let your brain quiet down for a minute.  Did you?  No, but it was not...  I'm trying to remember, like, what the fuck I did...  With all that time.  Dude, you could...  You couldn't call anybody.  At this point, if you leave your house without your phone, there's no reason to leave your  house.  You're like, why the fuck am I leaving my house?  What am I doing?  You can't relax.  You can't fucking relax.  It drives me crazy.  It has ruined my brain.  It's like, dude, I'll have days where I'm like, I got my work done.  I went to the gym.  I did what I had to do today. 
[02:33:30]  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a fucking two-hour nap.  I've earned this.  Nope.  And I can't fucking lay there because I'm so goddamn scared that somebody needs to get  in touch with me.  The fucking email's going off, the text, the phone.  It's ridiculous, man.  Our brains are not designed for this much stimulation.  Yeah.  Less than 10 years ago, you're like, I'm going to go home and check my messages.  Yeah, my messages.  Remember how great that was?  Yeah.  Boop.  And they can be pissed off.  You have three messages.  And you're like, oh, fuck, three.  Oh, okay.  Ew.  Pick up.  And they all started, pick up. 
[02:34:00]  Pick up.  Anthony, pick up.  I guess you're not home.  Oh, fuck.  And you'd be sitting over your answer machine going, come on.  I hope that fucking broad call.  Please don't let that shit call me.  And you get so excited.  Now, if she doesn't get right back to you, you're like, fucking cunt.  Tweet me, Facebook me, text me, email me, or call me.  You've got plenty of ways to get in touch with me.  Right.  And then you get the text from her.  I was in the shower.  What's your problem?  It's been three minutes.  Five minutes, you fucking asshole, right?  Three minutes.  What's my problem?  I thought you got decapitated somewhere. 
[02:34:30]  Jesus Christ.  Who are you fucking in the shower?  And there's no way to really blow anybody off on the phones.  No.  You can't hide.  There's so many ways to get in touch.  And then you think sometimes if someone's trying to get in touch with you and you go, all  right, I'm not going to call them.  Yeah.  But that means now I can't tweet.  Yeah.  I can't fucking know.  Because now they all know where you are.  I can't Facebook anything.  I can't do that.  Because then they know I got my phone right in my fucking hand.  Yeah.  You got to stay in your house.  You got to hide.  God forbid you want to have an affair or something.  You got to have a body double. 
[02:35:00]  And you're going to have to change cars in parking lots like they do when they're trying  to protect a mob guy.  Go inside an underground parking.  Put on another car.  Like a casino.  Yeah.  I told you.  If they put your name in that book, it's over.  You're in there without Capone, for Christ's sake.  Who the fuck is getting away with cheating?  Nobody.  Who the fuck is getting away with cheating?  You're absolutely right.  Who the fuck is getting away with that shit?  It just is.  There's no way you can give somebody that much information on how to get in touch with  you without your significant other knowing exactly who's getting in touch with you. 
[02:35:30]  I know a guy who will remain nameless for obvious reasons.  Yes.  We're in a cab the other night, and he goes, yeah, I fuck around with my girl all the time.  I go, really?  And I go, what do you do with your phone?  What do you do?  And he goes, oh, dude, I got another SIM card that I keep in my wallet.  He goes, I get home, boop, pop that one in.  It's all different contacts.  Right now there's a, holy shit.  And he's like, that goes out to all the fucking side girls.  And I'm like, you're a fucking genius. 
[02:36:00]  He's got this good boss SIM card and his naughty boss SIM card.  Unfortunately, there's a cabbie tweeting right now.  And you're copying it.  At Joe DeRosa, so-and-so are in my cab list.  Yeah, you're assuming any cab driver would know who the fuck I am.  So the anonymity protects me so I can have conversations like that.  It does.  It really stinks.  But that's like a real big thing to do.  Get another SIM card, go through all that.  Like most guys aren't, first of all, that smart. 
[02:36:30]  Or you don't want to go through that trouble.  Who wants another phone bill?  Another phone bill, my God.  But you can't get in touch with anyone without everyone knowing who you're getting in touch with.  And every social network now keeps you logged in.  Gmail keeps you logged in.  Yeah, yeah.  That's email.  But I mean, you know, Facebook, all that other bullshit, keeps you logged in.  So your girl can check all that shit, right?  Yeah.  Your phone, you're fucked.  All that stuff.  Your phone, you're fucked.  Dude, Facebook the other day, I got a notification that goes, do you want to give us your phone number? 
[02:37:00]  Only your friends will be able to see it on here.  I hate that shit.  Are you fucking crazy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think I'm doing that.  I don't understand enough about computers to know when I'm being fucked with.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I try to keep it as simple as possible.  How do I sign out?  When am I done?  Like, I have no idea if my computer is thinking right now.  I don't know.  Like, when people talk about spyware, other people using your computer as a hard drive,  I don't know if that's happening.  It could be happening right now. 
[02:37:30]  Even if you unplug it, I think the thing's still fucking me.  Your computer, I turned it off, it's still fucking me somehow.  That is a great point, because that's what got Anthony Weiner.  He didn't understand the basics of fucking Facebook and Twitter.  He had to say that and take a picture.  Yeah.  Your computer now is like a dirty accountant that's like, you know, 10 years down the road,  it's like, well, you gave us power of attorney.  You know what I mean?  Where did all my fucking...  Your computer is the nosy friend.  I did exactly what you asked of me.  Yeah.  Oh, you were smiling when you got those checks. 
[02:38:00]  It's Don Cheadle.  Donny!  Don Cheadle.  Donny!  He's a good actor.  He was on a plane with me yesterday.  Was he?  Yeah, in first.  There he is.  I was in coach.  Oh, come on.  Donny Cheadle!  You don't...  Can they hear us out there?  I'm hoping.  He's not going.  He's not coming on our show.  Why would he come on our show?  It's perfect.  Yeah, I didn't even...  Why not?  Cheadle!  Because it's not perfect.  What's up?  Hey!  He's a good actor, that guy.  Nothing.  Good actor.  He is.  You talk to him? 
[02:38:30]  He's like, I'm going in here, man.  Yeah, he's booked up.  How you doing, Don Cheadle?  I was on the plane with you yesterday.  How you doing, everybody?  How you doing, man?  Don, we just want to say hi.  That's all.  I know you're busy.  Big fan, man.  We can't take you away from another show.  That's not fair around here, but...  Yeah, look.  Look.  Get him in.  Get him in.  Say, look.  All right.  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle, ladies and gentlemen.  We could officially say we had Don Cheadle on the show.  Add him to the list of celebrities that have done the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:00]  That was fucking awesome.  Didn't even get on the mic.  People who are listening just have to take our word for it.  I know.  That Don Cheadle was just...  Didn't even get on the mic.  Holy shit, Morgan Freeman.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  I'm a fucking asshole.  I looked.  I looked like a fucking...  I almost...  Needy.  Fucking needy.  Oh, jeez.  All right, listen.  We can have anybody on the show right now.  That really doesn't matter.  Dead people.  Doesn't matter.  There's a mic somewhere.  Yeah.  I love you.  All right, listen. 
[02:39:30]  Mark Maron and Joe DeRosa.  So we got the What the Fuck podcast.  WTFpod.com.  Exactly.  Okay.  And you guys are doing shows up in Canada for the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Yes, sir.  You're going up there, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll be up there tomorrow through Sunday.  Tomorrow you're going.  Saturday.  Yeah.  When do you go?  I'm going Wednesday.  I got to do the keynote address.  I'm shitting my pants about it.  Oh, damn.  What's the keynote address?  I know they ask me to do this new thing they do.  It's like Andy Kingler does a State of the Industry.  And then the last few years, they've been doing this keynote thing.  And they asked me to do it months ago. 
[02:40:00]  And here's my insecurity.  My first thought was, like, they couldn't find anybody else?  I mean, it's months away.  I mean, why me?  Why would you say yes to that?  Well, I mean.  That's nerve-wracking.  It's very nerve-wracking.  Why would you put yourself in that situation?  It's Thursday at, like, 1 in the afternoon.  So no one's going.  So it's good.  Now Joe's going to go.  DeRosa's going to be there.  I'll be there.  No, everybody will be there.  It's 1 in the afternoon.  That's when everybody's coming.  Are you putting more pressure on him?  I don't want him to fail. 
[02:40:30]  Can I just get to it?  Hold on.  I got a draft right here, fellas.  Can we just go through it?  Yeah, let me just run this by you.  Could you guys help me punch this up a little bit?  Please punch it up.  We're going to talk more about Mark Maron's podcast after the break.  I want to know about Gallagher and his girlfriend.  I hear the girlfriend thing is doing okay now.  But you had some rough patches that I want to get into.  Yes, I surrendered.  And DeRosa, what do you want to talk about after the break?  Give us something.  Let's talk about some.  I'd like to talk about some relationship things, if we could. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, wow.  I'm in for that.  Because, yeah, I like talking about that shit with Mark, man.  It's fun having stories.  It's therapeutic.  This man is a mine of stories.  So I'd like to talk about that.  I'm the wrong way to do it.  You got a lady in your life, Joe?  No, and I'm trying to figure it all out right now.  So I've been having a lot of encounters.  Figure out whether or not you have a lady?  Let's put it that way.  No, I'm trying to figure out if I actually want that.  I'm at that crossroads where it's like, it's the same thing with going to the gym.  It's like, I just started going because I was at that crossroads of like, dude, you do it now or you'll never do it. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  And now I feel like, okay, buddy, you settle down now or you're never going to know how to do this.  You can't try to do this at 40.  Don't get ahead of yourself, though.  Sometimes you think you should be doing something because you're a certain age and you make some of the biggest mistakes of your life.  That's what I don't understand.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  That's what I'd like to talk about.  I think me and Anthony can help you.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to figure it all out next.  Oh, I'm floored.  The OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show, damn it.

The fact is, meat and dairy proteins, including whey, can't give you all the building blocks you need for maximum development and recovery.  By adding soy to your diet, you get the higher levels of naturally occurring L-glutamine and L-arginine.  Plus, it's good for your heart.  And believe me, I know the value of heart.

The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get. 
[02:51:00]  Musical icon and living legend, Elton John.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Sir Elton John.  Sir Elton, how are you with electronics?  With electronics?  Yes.  Hopeless.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:51:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.  F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  Hey, to my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend, and her new fuckin' boyfriend?  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  He can keep the goddamn patch.  F.U.s.  Hey, this is to the brilliant cocksmoker who decided to do a five-point turn in my brand-new driveway  and on our front lawn.  Thanks a lot.  That was a $6,000 driveway you just fucked up, asshole.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  This is Pack Rat the Trucker, and this F.U. goes out to the state of Missouri. 
[02:52:00]  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  I finally found the synthetic marijuana I can fuckin' smoke to pass a drug test.  Then you wanna make it fuckin' illegal.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  I wanna send this F.U.s.  out to the incompetent, affirmative action, hired piece of shit that was too fuckin' stupid to send  a goddamn fact out to fuck up my unemployment. 
[02:52:30]  Thanks a lot, you overeducated piece of motherfuckin' shit.  F.U.s.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F.U.s to Bobo.  I hate hearing you on the radio.  You make the hair stand up on the back of my neck and I cringe.  I hope you die in a fiery truck rack.  F.U.s.  F.U.s.  My students keep telling me to call you.  My name is Bill Tetley.  There's some radio jokes going on. 
[02:53:00]  I'd just like to know why you keep mentioning my name.  Fuck yeah!  Call the O.P. & Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  It's a virus.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. & Anthony Show.  Ah, for Joe DeRosa.  All right, listen. 
[02:53:30]  We got Marc Maron in studio and Joe DeRosa both killing, man.  Look what time it is, Ant.  I can't believe it.  This show flew fuckin' by.  That's how we gauge a show, by what time it is.  Oh yeah, flags by.  So whatever you want to say, make sure you say it before 9.58, because we're fuckin' out  of here.  That's where we're at now.  Yes, exactly.  With that said, I want to get back to Marc Maron's podcast, WTFpod.com. 
[02:54:00]  That's it.  All right.  And getting a lot of attention.  We got to do one with you guys.  Maybe next time I come in, we can record one in here if you want.  That'd be cool.  Can we do it in here, though?  Yeah.  Because it'd be easier than me swapping my, like, you know, yeah, here's my mics, fellas.  Can you just take, can you just hold my mics?  Can you just take this audio and make it into a podcast?  I can't.  Well, that's the thing.  People are saying you can have ONA on the podcast.  I'm like, is there anything they haven't fuckin' talked about?  I mean, am I gonna get anything?  Take the last hour.  Am I gonna make Anthony cry?  And I have been, I have been a gay American. 
[02:54:30]  All right, we'll do it.  If you just want to come out on your show.  Good.  Good.  I'll announce that I'm actually a happy person.  Yeah, we can tell you some things.  All right.  Which would the audience find more shocking?  Right?  I'm happy when I'm not here.  I'll tell you that much.  We'll do it.  We'll figure it out.  Ah, you can get into what my shit's all about.  Gallagher.  Yeah.  Oh.  You know, that thing was, people...  What happened for the people out there that don't know?  Well, I did a podcast with Gallagher.  You can get it if you get the app. 
[02:55:00]  You can hear that one.  But I was in Portland, Oregon.  I get an email from my manager who got an email from his manager who lives in Portland,  said he was in Portland, would I have him on the show?  Now, I've got to be honest with you.  I didn't like that guy when I was old enough to like him, which is 10.  Yeah.  And I didn't have...  There was not a lot of love there.  But that doesn't mean that as a relatively objective fan and part of the comic community,  I couldn't put him into perspective in the sense that he started with all the guys. 
[02:55:30]  And, you know, he was at the comedy store in the late 70s.  And I thought there was an interesting story there.  So I say, okay.  So he comes to the hotel.  I meet him downstairs.  He's like, why don't we tell him?  And I'm like, well, we're going to do a podcast.  Like, is it live?  And I'm like, no, I'm going to record it in my room.  And then he tries to teach me how to steal coffee out of a conference room.  Whatever.  So we go up to the room.  That's him.  Yeah.  And I'd read up on him.  Like, you know, I'd read up that he's not, you know, he's not smashing shit as much  and that he's doing a lot of gay jokes and a lot of jokes about ethnic people. 
[02:56:00]  So I tried to have a conversation.  Like, at first I started talking to him about, you know, about his place in comedy.  And right away he's like, why does Jay Leno have a show?  Why don't I have a show?  I should have my own show.  Like, and he screeches like this old queen.  Yeah, yeah, he does.  And like right away, right away I'm like, I'm a little bit like, I'm like, all right,  I can handle this.  I'm trying to wrangle him, but he's talking down to me.  And almost immediately he starts saying, like, comedians shouldn't drink water on stage.  You know, that's not a real comedian.  A comedian doesn't need a notebook. 
[02:56:30]  And I'm like, so now he's shitting on everybody.  Shouldn't drink water?  Whatever.  What?  It was crazy.  The fuck does that mean?  You're going to hydrate yourself.  Right.  But I'm willing to sort of let the guy talk because I want, you know.  So then I bring up these accusations, you know, that, you know, he's being right.  And look, I got a little bit of flack, but I don't give a fuck what anyone says.  I mean, you know me.  I mean, my friends are Jim and everybody else.  Look, if you can own what you say, say it.  What do I care?  Right.  But I'm going to ask.  I can ask.  Of course.  I'm not, you know, I'm not politically correct in any way when it comes to language.  So I bring this up and then, you know, right away he goes, they're not even my jokes. 
[02:57:00]  They're street jokes.  And he starts screeching.  And I'm not even pressing that hard.  I'm just trying to, I'm trying to.  He's trying to get in his head a little bit.  I'm trying to converse with him because he never shuts up.  And he acts like he's teaching you a lesson.  And then, you know, and then he starts going on about like, you know, he says, you're never  going to play a state fair.  And I'm like, who the fuck would want to play a state fair?  A state fair.  Jesus Christ.  What year is this?  And he's like, everybody, you know, so me in America. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  But then he gets it.  Got a gig in Sleepy Eye tonight.  Right.  I go on right after a horse with no name.  All right.  See you, Gallagher.  Have a good time.  And then I say, what are you angry about?  I say, what are you angry about?  He goes, I'm not angry.  And I'm like, you're the guy that smashes shit.  I'm just trying to engage.  And then about a half hour and he goes, I'm not doing this.  And he storms out of the room like a giant baby.  And I just said, really, I'm not going after you.  And then there was a moment where I just, I didn't have to put this up either. 
[02:58:00]  But there was, because it didn't make me look great either.  But there was a moment there where I said, oh, come on, Gallagher.  To nobody.  To nobody.  You hear a door closing.  You know what's great?  If someone goes to leave, you can just go like, get the fuck out of my house.  Yeah, right.  After the door slant.  But look, I put it up because I thought, I don't think I look great.  I could have done a little more homework.  I might have.  I tried to be as respectful as possible.  But I was genuinely surprised that he stormed out. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, I did not.  I could not understand it.  But people who listen to it have one opinion or the other.  A lot of people thought I was being some sort of politically correct police, which I wasn't.  I don't give a shit.  I really don't care what people say.  And the truth of the matter is, is that when you say something, if shit comes back at you, that's part of saying something.  Yeah.  I mean, you're going to take your hits.  But you certainly have the freedom to say it.  He did our show a few times.  We loved having him on.  He's a very different.  He's a very strange bird.  Well, because he's such a fucking weirdo. 
[02:59:00]  He's curing cancer.  He's building things.  Oh, his inventions are just, he has a million of them.  I heard he, like, lectures, I was at a couple theaters where he had performed, and I was like, they were like, we just had Gallagher here.  And they were like, yeah, he, like, lectured the audience about metaphysics.  And then, like, when they didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, he started calling them all stupid.  And then he took out the hammer at the end.  And then he gets his hammer out. 
[02:59:30]  He did our show back at K-Rock.  He did it here as well.  And after the show, he sits in the hall for hours and just day trades.  Doesn't go home.  Right.  And he also has a, even though his appearance was long, you know, hours ago.  He likes to school people.  He thinks he knows things.  Like, there's some weird thing, a part about him.  Like, I thought that if you listen to the episode, you get a very, you know who that guy is.  And I guess my pride got into it because I just couldn't believe that he was talking down to me on some level.  And I knew he made a lot of money, and I knew that, you know, he was this guy.  But the weird thing about him is that the bane of his existence was that this hammer thing was just this one bit he did. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  I think that it really sticks in his craw.  It just caught on, and it was really just one sketch.  And then it became who he is.  But his whole argument that, like, I deserve this, I deserve that, because his whole premise is like, you know, Jay Leno and David Letterman, they didn't go out on the road and sell tickets.  I did.  And my point was, well, that's what you chose.  That's right.  And that's that.  You did your research, because, yeah, he's known for smashing watermelon. 
[03:00:30]  Simple as that.  And he might be a deeper guy, but none of us really know that.  I want you to get to that.  It would have done him right if he would have openly talked to you about all that.  I'd have him back.  Yeah, why not?  Because that's what people really think.  He smashes shit.  That's all we know.  And that's all we care about.  I think that's why he overcompensates with metaphysics and schooling people.  And is that like he wants to be known as some sort of nuclear physicist?  That's the worst.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, he wants them to know he's smart.  And that's the most dangerous thing a comedian could ever have. 
[03:01:00]  Look, I'm smart.  Yeah.  I'm smart, too.  Yeah, I'm smart.  I was passed over.  I was like, don't look everybody thinks.  Jay Leno.  Let me get the hammer.  We should get Roland in here, because Roland says that Gallagher will never do our show again.  Well, Patrice called him out, right?  We had a great study with Patrice going after Gallagher.  It was terrific.  Saying that, because Gallagher would just be a fucking racist.  He is, actually.  He's a fucking racist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's like, you can't say that about it. 
[03:01:30]  He's like, I fucking heard some shit.  Yeah, Patrice wouldn't back down.  It was great.  He looked at him.  Really?  Patrice wouldn't back down?  That's unusual.  Where are we at with Gallagher, Roland?  Well, last time was a while ago.  I called him.  He was at Walmart.  And he said, stop calling me.  You're killing me.  You're killing me.  And I hung up.  At Walmart?  Yeah, he was at Walmart.  Working?  What position?  God damn it.  I was trying to get to it.  God damn it.  Oh, DeRosa.  Loses by a nose.  That was a close one. 
[03:02:00]  Sorry.  You guys phoned Ted's on that one.  I would have let you have it.  As I said, don't call me again.  You guys are trying to murder me.  Oh.  That's sad.  Wow.  He feels persecuted.  Yeah.  Unless he literally thinks we're trying to murder him and walking around looking for  our hit squad.  That's too bad.  Did you see the video where he collapsed on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Three weeks after my podcast.  I got a lot of tweets for that one.  Oh, did you?  Look what you did to Gallagher.  They blamed you, right?  I was opening for a...  Not as poor food choices. 
[03:02:30]  They blame you.  I opened for Patton Oswalt one time.  And we were doing some theater.  Gallagher was there like the night or two days before.  And the stage manager picks us up.  And we're driving out to the theater.  And he's telling us, yeah, Gallagher was just here.  And we're like, oh, that's cool, whatever.  And the stage manager goes, yeah, funny story, man.  You know, in his rider, he has this thing that he needs a table, four feet by two feet.  And he's like, so I got him this table.  It was just a really nice Victorian table.  It looked nice on stage. 
[03:03:00]  And he goes, but then he shows up.  And I didn't know.  He meant he needed the table for the Sledge-O-Matic.  He's like, so I'm scrambling.  I had to build him a table.  I didn't know what to do.  I mean, the guy should have specified.  Why wouldn't he tell me that that's what the table was for?  And he's freaking out at the table.  And Patton just goes, Patton just goes, let me get this straight.  You had a show where Gallagher asked for a table and you didn't know what it was for.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  And there was this awkward silence for the next, like, five minutes. 
[03:03:30]  So just like, ooh, yeah.  I don't feel great about that interview, but I did what I could.  Did you feel like you were attacking him, though?  He always feels attacked.  I know, but he does.  He thinks you're trying to kill him.  He's got this persecution complex, and he was impossible to talk to, but I just wasn't going to be filibustered and steamrolled.  I was just trying to get him into some groove where we could have a conversation, but he was so guarded and weird. 
[03:04:00]  It didn't sound like that had an agenda, though.  You can't.  You didn't have an agenda.  I had a little bit of an agenda.  I had an agenda in the sense that I wanted to place him into the context of the comedy store in the late 70s.  Okay, well.  And then I did have the agenda of asking about this shift in his act.  You know, because it's one thing to move away from a sledge-o-matic and do another type of comedy.  It's another thing to all of a sudden, like, I'm getting rid of the sledge-o-matic, and now all Chinese people have to die.  Yeah, I mean, you know, so, and I'm not saying that that's his agenda,  but, I mean, it's a weird shift from the sledge-o-matic to, you know, shitting on lesbians, Chinese people, gay people, 
[03:04:30]  and then saying, like, well, you know, I have a few black people at my show, so I don't do that.  You know, but, I mean, to put a can of water chestnuts on a table and then go,  this is for the Chinese people, and then smash them.  I mean, it's a little hardcore, and I wanted him to answer to it a little bit.  So, yeah, I had an agenda in that way.  Is that funny?  Maybe I'm wrong.  Is that funny?  Is there, I want to hear, putting a fruit salad on there, this is for the fruits. 
[03:05:00]  I mean, okay, it's still the sledge-o-matic, but, I mean, it's a little bit heavy.  Well, the number one fruit is the watermelon, so.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, think about it.  That could go wrong.  Are there clips?  I want to hear, like, a clip of racist Gallagher.  I've never heard it.  Is that something that's out there somewhere?  No, it's alleged.  I think we pushed him in that direction a little bit.  He's sort of racist.  There's an article in The Stranger.  If you Google The Stranger, which is a Seattle paper in Gallagher, that, I mean, that was  the article I read, and my biggest mistake was not actually, I didn't have the examples 
[03:05:30]  in front of me, so it was sort of general, you know, and that kind of pissed me off.  If I would have just said, you know, what about this joke?  But he still says, like, they're street jokes, and I understand that.  But my issue is that if whatever's left of his audience, whatever's left of the people  that still hold on to him as a great entertainer from when they were 11, and now they're still  showing up, and he is, you know, slamming Asians, and it's a little odd.  You know, where does that come from?  That was my only question.  It wasn't like you shouldn't say that. 
[03:06:00]  It's like, where does it come from?  They're bringing their plastic slickers, because they got front row tickets, and they're  all like, and then they're just listening to a diatribe of racist jokes.  You're like, wait a minute, where's the fuck?  What is this for?  No swicker's going to protect you against that.  He just takes out his cock and pisses on the first three rows.  That would be a good show.  Here's time for the plastic, yo.  That would be fucking great.  I would love that.  Oh, you brought plastic to see the fucking Noel Gallagher show, right?  Yeah.  How about this, you motherfucker? 
[03:06:30]  And just starts, like, Gigi Allen throwing his shit.  Oh, yeah.  This is for the Jews.  Fast forward a year, the whole audience is in white sheets now instead of the plastic.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Cheering for Gallagher.  There you go.  We've tried to get him back on the show.  He has no desire to do our show.  He, to me, is like the worst kind of comic, because he's like, he's one of these guys  that is clearly a fairly intelligent guy.  He seems like a smart guy.  He does, you know, his wordplay and all that bullshit. 
[03:07:00]  You're like, all right, he's a smart guy.  But he's the smart guy for that sort of redneck-y crowd.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, he was never the smart guy for the New York or the L.A. or the San Francisco type  audience.  That's why he plays state fairs.  Yeah, and it's like, and now he's angry because he wants everybody to declare him a genius.  It's like, no, dude, you chose, you accepted that path, and like, that's where you're at  now.  I mean, that's it.  The other thing is, is that he's irrelevant.  And the other, some of the input I got was like, why are you picking on Gallagher?  And I can understand that. 
[03:07:30]  But I didn't seek him out.  But the fact is, he's just this old guy that's trying to hold on to something, and it's difficult.  I don't think you're picking on him.  He's an angry man.  He is a very angry guy.  And we didn't even have conversations with him when he was on this show.  What it was, was us talking and him interrupting with something so outrageously weird that we  found it hilarious.  Yeah.  Like, it's like, what?  This guy's fucking out of his mind.  Like, what would he say, though?  Like, what would he interrupt with? 
[03:08:00]  We would be talking about relationships.  If we're talking about relationships.  X-ray machines.  Yeah.  He'd be like, hey, you know what I'm working on?  Yeah.  And you're like, we were just talking about something.  All right, Gallagher, what?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  What would it be?  It's been a while, but it's been.  Some kind of space thing.  A cure for cancer.  Yeah, he loves cures for cancer and fucking machines that.  That ionized water for things.  Oh, that's right.  Like, just bizarre things. 
[03:08:30]  But he couldn't build himself a new act.  No.  You know where all that shit.  He could put a fucking car door on a tricycle to come out with on stage.  It just sucks.  So he could roll the window down.  It just sucks.  I'm working on a giant big wheel for me to ride out in front of the audience.  Oh, well, look.  He's got the giant couch and he's jumping on it.  Wow.  He made a lot of money.  A lot of money.  Tons of specials.  Those Showtime specials.  My brother liked him.  Every week they were on.  Yep.  Dude, he did like 10 of those fucking things.  More than that, I think. 
[03:09:00]  What are you saying there?  How many specials did he do?  He was like 14.  Anyone that goes to a state fair to see Gallagher should just be fucking shot.  Well, I'm theorizing, obviously.  I don't know the guy, but I'm telling you.  Speculating.  Speculating.  Maybe that's the thing.  Yeah.  But he's sitting there going, why am I not Carlin?  And it's like, because George...  Right, right.  Because Gallagher, when Carlin was talking about pro-life versus abortion in the 90s,  you were fucking bringing in a hula hoop with springs on it. 
[03:09:30]  Or whatever.  13.  13 specials.  13.  13 specials.  Carlin only beat him by two.  Damn, man.  Wow.  That's nuts.  That is crazy.  All right.  I want to ask Mark about his relationship, too.  Oh, let's see.  Yeah, because Joe wants to get into that, too.  Well, the last time I was here, I met a woman who contacted me through email.  Basically, the email was just, hey, Mark Maron.  And I said, hey, what? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, you know.  And we met up, and we spent the weekend together.  It was great.  And then, you know, basically, she ended up moving in, and I didn't realize that was happening.  You know, she ended up moving to L.A., and we were hanging out, and then a lot of her  stuff was showing up at my house.  And all of a sudden, all of her stuff was at my house, and it was all over my house.  And I freaked out.  I was like, you got to get the fuck out.  You know, I didn't know what to do.  It got really weird and dramatic.  And, you know, police were involved.  It was very exciting.  Why?  With the police involved. 
[03:10:30]  Because she didn't want to leave, you know?  And then, like, three months went by where I didn't contact her at all and everything.  And then, like, I couldn't fight the feelings, man.  I mean, I just loved her.  And after three months, after all this insanity, I realized, who the fuck am I to judge someone  being crazy?  You know, I mean, I've been in relationships before, but all of a sudden, I'm the stable  one, I'm saying, like, no, she's crazy.  And I'm like, who is talking?  Two marriages in, no kids, anger problem.  I'm going to sit here and say, like, I know better.  So, eventually, I buckled, and I said, well, I'm going to honor the love, man. 
[03:11:00]  So, needless to say, most of her shit is at my house again.  But I adore her, and I'm just going to have to write it out.  And it's a little weird, because she's 28, and she does that thing where it's like, well,  I want kids, and now I'm in this weird position where I'm like, I have to deal with  that conversation every once in a while.  And it's hard, because he's sort of just trying to kick the can down the road a little  bit.  Like, yeah, I mean, I've thought about it.  It's never that.  But, you know, I understand you want to.  I mean, like, what are we eating? 
[03:11:30]  Where do you want to go eat?  And then, like, you know, because I know she wants kids, and I know that that conversation  is really just about, are you going to stay with me?  And then I had this other weird moment where we're in the shower.  I'm taking a shower with her, and I'm washing her back, because I need to get under the  head.  It was not a big altruistic thing.  And I just was like, I need to get under the water.  So I'm washing her back, and she turns to me, and she goes, are you practicing for when  I'm paralyzed?  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  And then I say, no, you'll be in a hospital.  And then I didn't realize it was really the same question, because she wanted me to say, 
[03:12:00]  like, yeah, of course I'll take care of you if you're paralyzed.  But I'm thinking, like, now I got you and the kid?  I got to take care of you.  The paralyzed woman, the kid?  But the thing is, is that I just at some point said, well, fuck it.  You know, I'm 47.  Yeah, I have a lot of feelings for this chick.  And, you know, we're both crazy.  I just got to pick my fights and not be such a lunatic.  You know, it's weird when you're in a relationship, you have that moment.  And I know I'm a little old to have this moment where you're like, oh, my God, she's her own 
[03:12:30]  person that I can't control.  And, you know, you really just have to really remind yourself of that.  That, like, you know, it's not some heinous crime if she doesn't like the same music you like.  There's a moment where we're at the Soundgarden concert, and she gets bored because it's not her trip.  And she starts looking at her phone, and part of me is like, oh, fuck this.  Fuck this.  How could you not like this?  And at a different point in my life, that would have ruined the evening.  That would have been what you would have said.  You'd be sitting there playing CDs, like, no, listen. 
[03:13:00]  Listen to him.  Listen to the words.  Listen to the words, man.  Listen to what he's saying.  As long as she stands there, to me, she can have her nose in her phone.  As long as she stands there and puts up with it and doesn't do the shitty walk away, walk  back, distracting you thing.  Whatever it is.  You know what I mean?  Then it's fine.  Like, I don't, like, there was a period there where I didn't know if she was getting, like,  I don't smoke dope, and I don't, you know, I know she likes to get high and stuff,  and that used to drive me crazy.  But now, like, look, if I have feelings for her, and I like having sex with her, and I like having  her around, eventually, if you're a grown person or somebody who at least acknowledges 
[03:13:30]  where you are in your life, you're like, you can do whatever the fuck you want.  Just try not to fuck any other guys, and don't leave me crying.  Right.  That's all you ask for.  Well, you know, you want to aim high.  Yeah, that bar really isn't that high.  That's good.  That's the starting off point.  I just want to make a living.  So you're four months in to stage two.  Well, no, I've known her a year, and I think we're about four or five months into stage two.  I don't really, you know, I'm just paralyzed with fear. 
[03:14:00]  After the last thing, you get left, you get divorced, and it was brutal, you know?  Would you get married again for the third time?  Is she listening?  Is she listening right now?  You want to write down your answer?  No, I don't know if she's listening.  I think she's getting her nails done in Brooklyn, but I, you know, look, every time I say something  on stage, I know, like, I did this whole thing on Conan about, like, her, you know, texting  me a picture of her pussy, and, like, I forget that this is a person, you know?  And then, you know, after we broke up, she's got to go into the world, and people she knows 
[03:14:30]  come up to her and go, did you really take, you know, she's got to go to her job, you know?  And so I've just become a little more respectful, and I don't know if I'm going to get married.  I did buy her a dresser, that's where I'm at now, because the clothes thing just got  out of hand.  I'm like, we've got to put these things into something.  They can't just be all over the house.  That's a step forward.  That's, you know.  Yeah, I'm starting with that.  That's a big step.  And also, there's that moment, like, here's the other moment of intimacy that I acknowledge  is that at some night, you know, you cross the line and go, I don't know what the 
[03:15:00]  hell we both ate, but we had gas bad, and there was no hiding it.  You know that first time where you're with a chick, and then all of a sudden, you're both  fucking farting?  No, I've never gotten that far.  And all you can do is hold them like you hold a dying person.  You know, like, it's going to be okay.  We're going to get through this?  We're going to get through this.  Literally never got that far.  You've got a lactate.  But I know that there's just a stone's throw away from shitting in front of each other when  you have to.  If someone's in the shower, you can't wait or whatever.  And then the next thing is, like, you got a baby.  Let's bring someone else's poop into this.  Oh, boy.  Let's bring someone else's poop into this situation. 
[03:15:30]  I would love to know what it's like to be at that stage.  You don't even get to those stages.  No, never got that far.  The most I've ever been with somebody, eight months, and we didn't get to the shitting  and farting point.  No?  No.  That's a lot of holding your farts in, buddy.  Well, one time I was banging her up the ass, and shit came out.  But that's a different story.  That is different.  Oh, you give her a pass on that one?  But God forbid farting in front of her, right, Joe?  Well, yeah, I don't know.  I just never got to that.  Anything during sex.  I don't know. 
[03:16:00]  I think it's my...  There's just so much shit here that, you know...  Where is it, Joe?  Where is it?  I'm at a point.  Let's get into that shit, Joe.  I'm at a point.  Hey, we're doing a podcast, I noticed.  Yeah.  How does it usually end?  Saking into his podcast.  Sorry.  I apologize, guys.  I apologize.  No, go, go.  I love it.  How does it usually end, Joe?  Let's go back to the ass pocket.  No, I love it.  How does it end?  Yeah.  Let's go back to the ass pocket.  No, no.  I mean, like, if you have an eight-month relationship, like, how do these relationships usually  end?  Is it...  Never good.  It's never good.  This is how fucked up I am. 
[03:16:30]  But you seem like a nice guy.  How could it go horribly wrong?  Oh, there's a mean person inside there.  No, no, no.  This is how it ends.  It ends with them crying and then me crying that I'm hurting them.  Why are they crying?  I'm an asshole.  Because they're upset that I'm dumping them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And why are you dumping them?  Because I can't just get it.  I think it's a self-esteem thing.  Like, I'm at a point with relationships where I feel like when she starts dating, she's  opening the box from Hellraiser, and I'm coming out of it, going, your suffering will  be legendary. 
[03:17:00]  So, you know, it's a thing in here where I'm like...  What are you looking for that you're just not getting from these relationships, Joe?  Mommy.  Mommy.  Oh, boy.  Well, I'm adopted.  I have abandonment issues.  You know, yeah.  A lot of that comes into it, man.  A lot of that comes into it.  Yeah.  I just want to have, I just want to have somebody to relax with and get through the...  But I'm telling you, the fucking, the panic.  I have dated so many great girls this year, beautiful, sweet, good people, great personalities. 
[03:17:30]  The second it starts to get anywhere near commitment, I literally panic.  I get depressed.  I'm like, what am I doing?  I can't do this.  Wow.  But I'm just now starting to realize, oh, that's fear of intimacy and commitment.  I never understood that before.  I always thought it was just, why am I getting tired of these girls so quickly?  Now it's like, no, dude, you fucked up.  You got to get through this.  Oh, man.  And I don't know what to do.  If I'm not...  Wow, you fucked.  If I don't make some serious money soon, it's going to be a real problem. 
[03:18:00]  That'll solve it, right, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, money's really going to...  You don't have to worry about that as far as commitment issues go or anything.  Put it this way.  The girl I'm with now, my girlfriend, she wanted one of the walk-in closets in the bedrooms.  Now, she has a full closet in one of the other bedrooms, but not in the master bedroom.  Right.  Because I have my walk-in closet, which is all my clothes.  Yeah.  And I have my other walk-in closet, which used to belong to the X. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  But when she left, it is now my gun safe.  It is a walk-in closet...  A shrine of hate.  A shrine of hate.  A shrine of hate and destruction.  Yeah.  It is a walk-in closet with magnetic locks and a separate alarm on it.  Yeah, I've been in it.  I've never been so curiously aroused as I was when I was in your gun closet.  But she keeps bringing up the fact that, you know, it would be nice if I had my clothes  in here or something.  I'm like, no.  No.  It's my gun closet. 
[03:19:00]  Well, and then she looks at my closet and goes, you know, you don't really wear half  of the stuff in here.  And I'm like, no.  That's my closet.  That's my gun closet.  I go, you've got a whole room with a whole closet.  Yeah, but I've got to walk out of the bedroom and go around and say, but that's your closet.  These are my closets.  Sounds like someone has to buy a dresser.  You've got to buy a dresser.  See?  It's buying the dresser.  But those are the little things that I need to keep doing to feel that I'm not married.  Right.  But did you tell her the last time someone had clothes in that closet, look what happened. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, that was bad.  It's not true.  Well, you know, kind of right about that.  Best just leave those closets alone.  One with the guns, one mine.  You take the other room.  You know what really is depressing when you're not in a relationship?  And this is really what's starting to get to me.  I'll get like travel magazines in the mail and stuff.  I'll be like, oh, that Greece looks lovely.  This is a very affordable trip.  It's the worst.  I think I'm going to go there.  I'm going to go to Greece this summer.  Then I'm like, with who? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Traveling by yourself is the worst.  You pray love.  You pray love.  You know it, faggot.  Take it easy.  Now we're going to get letters.  Oh, I know.  People that like rom-coms.  You see these things and you're like, I want to go do that.  I'd love to go to, I don't know, fucking Cape Cod or some shit and just relax.  You're like, with who?  With my buddies?  Why?  So we can get shit-faced somewhere else? 
[03:20:30]  Somewhere else.  We can do that in my apartment for way cheaper.  You go by yourself.  That's even worse.  Like sometimes I'll travel on the road and you're like, I'm in a great town and I'm not  leaving my room.  Yeah.  You just bring the shit with you.  Yeah.  Just in the room.  Yeah.  I like traveling with her.  That's the thing.  It's like, I don't know how to explain it, but I like having her around.  I mean, I like, she just, you know, I like just looking over at the couch and she's sitting  there on a pile of her own clothes playing Angry Birds.  I'm like, I love this. 
[03:21:00]  That's hilarious.  I just hear this noise of the froggy game.  Like, that's love.  That's the sound of love.  That's great, right?  It sounds nice, man.  It is nice, actually.  She wants that.  I do.  I can't get past that, that, that one, that one point though, where, where you're comfortable.  Is it like where both of you are sitting around not doing anything?  No, I love that.  Have you ever been with a girl that like, you're not on a date all the time or.  I love that.  The two times.  Yeah.  No, I get to that very quickly.  In fact, one of my friends told me, he goes, that's your problem, dude. 
[03:21:30]  He goes, you skipped the whole courting period.  You skipped the whole romance.  Yeah, we don't do that.  Going out to dinner.  He goes, you go right to, let's sleep at my place every night.  Right.  And it's like, yeah, well, that's my fucking life.  I can't help it.  I don't know what else to do.  And, but the two or three times that I've gotten into this sort of relationship territory,  one time it was good and I just said, I can't do this.  But the other times, these girls ravaged me, man.  They ravaged my trust.  They ravaged my emotions. 
[03:22:00]  Really?  In seven months, everything got ugly, huh?  What was that?  Three months in, you're a broken man.  Were you looking for sympathy from us?  Wow.  No.  That's a sad story.  Wow.  Ravaged.  He's ravaged.  You know, you open up a little bit here and look at this shit.  Just dickheads. 
[03:22:30]  Open up.  You might as well have just opened a toilet lid.  You're fucking, we do shit all over you.  Jesus Christ.  Let's get Don Thiel in here.  He'll hug you.  He looks like a hugger.  Yeah, he looks like a hugger.  Now, before you were rudely on, I want to know what type of ravaging could be done with  your trust, obviously fucking around on you, I guess.  That's the ultimate.  One of the girls, I think, was probably fucking around on me. 
[03:23:00]  Think.  But she brought me in and brought me out so many times and every time just fucked with  me and fucked with my emotions and told me she wanted something and then she would dump  me the next day, like that up and down thing.  So there was one, one was that, one was we broke up because she was fucking crazy, fucking  crazy.  And I dumped her and she proceeded to do everything she could to ruin my life.  Yeah.  So you'd be back, you should be back together with her.  All right.  That sounds like that's the one for you.  That sounds like a keeper.  Really vindictive shit. 
[03:23:30]  Really, really mean vindictive shit.  Like what?  Um, she, I don't want to say too much, but she, she worked somewhere where I worked and  I all of a sudden didn't work there anymore.  That was the beginning of it.  Um, my, I had a friend that worked in this place.  She got my friend fired, um, to, to teach me a lesson.  It was literally like mob shit.  Like we're going to fucking send him a lesson.  Whack him out too.  Exactly.  Shit like that.  It was just crazy.  And you know, when something like that happens, whether it's after three years or a little 
[03:24:00]  fucking pussy seven months, uh, but this is a weird thing because I know two or three  guys that went through this, uh, you know, borderline stalker ish kind of like there's  something going on.  I know it's probably always gone on, but there, there's something when you lock in with somebody  who becomes vindictive and then you can't like, I got a buddy now he had to get a restraining  or I mean, but that happens a lot more.  Is that possible?  It didn't, it didn't get to restraining order level, but it got to the point where I would 
[03:24:30]  call her up and I would literally be crying going, please stop doing this.  Oh, wow.  I love you as a human being.  It just wasn't going to work.  She must have loved you.  She hung up and had an orgasm.  Dude, it was horrible.  It was horrible.  You played right into her hand.  And phone sex for her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No shit.  She's just coming.  Oh, oh, Joe's crying.  Oh.  Joe's crying again.  Yeah.  Just horrible.  Well, at least I have good friends that I can talk about on the radio with.  Sorry, I'm sorry, Joe. 
[03:25:00]  I'm sorry for your pain.  That sucks, man.  Do you cry a lot, Joe?  I'll get emotional over shit.  Yeah, movies will break me up pretty easily.  What was the last movie that broke you up?  What the?  I can cry when I'm watching Chopped.  What was I watching?  And I fucking...  Seriously, I watched Chopped on the cooking channel when the guy makes a good meal and  he didn't think he was going to win and he wins.  Oh, I thought it was just the onions.  No, no.  I felt like you were feeling the onions for the TV.  No, I cry very inappropriately.  Never appropriately.  What was the last movie you cried at, Joe?  I can't remember off the top of my head.  I know there was one since then, but I remember the two recent ones where I watched Love Actually 
[03:25:30]  at Christmas time.  Oh, no.  And I cried like a little bitch in my apartment.  And then I watched Grumpy Old Men with My Parents at Christmas.  Oh, my God.  You're such a fucking girl.  At the part where Walter Matthau, when Jack Lemmon has the heart attack and Walter Matthau  goes to the hospital, they have the big argument.  Yeah.  And the nurse goes, are you a friend or family, sir?  And he doesn't know what to say.  And he goes, friend or family?  And he just goes, friend. 
[03:26:00]  Like that, I literally faked like I had to go get water.  Is that it with a cry in front of my parents?  I walked in the other room and was fucking toweling off my eyes.  It's funny, though, because you're like me.  Like, I'll cry at movies, commercials, anything.  And the only time you'll cry in a relationship is when you've fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah, like where you're like, you're never going to cry appropriately because you're having  a real emotion.  It's just sort of like, don't leave.  Don't leave.  You're like, I'm an asshole.  What is that?  It's a sickness. 
[03:26:30]  It's a mental problem.  It's called being a comedian.  Yes, you're welcome to the world.  It's ridiculous.  I sit there, like, when I think about, like, acting, I go, god damn, if I could only cry  on cue, oh, I could up my acting.  I know I could.  If I could just cry on cue, that's the one thing I can't get to.  You can't take yourself to those places.  But then, yeah, but then I watch a, you know, a commercial for that movie, The Help, and  I'm fucking tearing halfway through it.  I'm like, why the fuck can I access this?  Put the movies in the back of your head while you're doing your acting. 
[03:27:00]  I cried a little yesterday, actually.  I just remembered that.  Oh, man.  Yeah?  Was it bad?  Well, no, we woke up.  I woke up with the girl.  We had to leave, you know, get an eight o'clock flight, right?  And the night before, she had to do laundry, which means she had to wash everything she  owns.  All right, so it's like midnight.  We got to get up the next morning and go to the airport.  There are dresses hanging on the deck, hanging in the bathroom.  And she was like, I'll deal with it tomorrow.  I'm like, we got to get up early.  How are you going to deal with this?  Right?  So then the alarm goes off, and she's like, I'm going to sleep for another half hour.  I'm like, no, you're going to get the fuck up. 
[03:27:30]  And you got to get, I didn't say that.  I said, we got to pack.  We got to get out of here.  Because I know her well enough to know.  I don't want to be, because I know myself.  I don't want to be freaking out.  So she gets out of bed.  She's like, all right.  And then all of a sudden, it's that tone.  It's like, and she's pulling dresses down angrily.  And then I get into it, and she's like, you're sick.  Because I'm yelling.  She's like, you're a sick person.  Look at you, getting pleasure out of yelling at me.  I'm like, I'm sick.  You can't even get control of your life.  There's fucking clothes all over there.  And we're both yelling at each other.  And I know, I'm like, you're not going to fucking New York.  And then I realized, what does that mean?  I'm not going to leave her at the house. 
[03:28:00]  If I'm going to break up with her right now, how am I going to deal with the house?  So then I knew I wasn't going to break up with her, of course.  So we'd start fighting and fighting.  And then this is a grown-up moment for me.  Because in the past, I would have just locked into that anger.  But I got out of the room.  I went and made some coffee.  And I realized, dude, this is not, you've got to pick your fights.  But of course, she's already crying, and everything's on the line.  Oh, shit.  But I'm like, and I walk back in there.  And I'm like, look, I want to be with you.  Let's just stop.  And I felt a few squirt out.  And I'm like, oh, good. 
[03:28:30]  Thank God.  This is so well-timed.  My heart is functioning properly.  And we were all right.  We went to the airport.  Jesus.  Wow, that could have been bad, though.  You were teetering on the brink.  Three months ago, I wouldn't have made it here.  I wouldn't have been here.  I would have been changing my locks.  I'm growing.  I'm growing.  Wow, there's just like a majority there.  I'd see a different person.  We haven't seen Mark at all.  He's different.  Yeah, he's fucking.  So I'm going to, how old are you? 
[03:29:00]  47.  So I'll be there by the time I'm 47.  I got another 14 years to have.  Jesus, do better for yourself.  You don't have a chance, Joe.  Deal with this shit.  Go into therapy.  Find a girl that's like reasonable and learn how to fucking.  Therapy is such a crutch.  I hate that.  Joe is young enough to feel like this.  Joe's young enough to feel like this and it'd still be okay.  I'm not.  Like, you'll figure shit out.  The thing is, you'll figure shit out.  But, you know, quite honestly.  He needs more than that.  No.  Just repress everything. 
[03:29:30]  We're therapists right here.  Shove it down.  That's right.  But what happened to you and what happened to me, like, by figuring it out means you're  going to be humbled, fucker.  Yeah.  You are going to be broken down.  And you're not going to.  And you're going to realize exactly who you are.  And how you fucked up your life.  And then you're going to cry all by yourself.  And you realize, holy shit, I'm going to die soon.  What are you, putting a curse on me?  Maybe the curse on me.  He is pointing at him.  And your children's children.  I'll box on you and your entire family. 
[03:30:00]  You picked the wrong girls, Joe.  Okay, therapy's a crutch, but you can get a little bit of insight and maybe do things  a little differently.  Just go a few times or find a book.  Do something for yourself.  He just nailed it, though.  He just nodded to the question.  He's picking the wrong girls.  So why are you continuing to pick the wrong girls?  You know what I think it is, man?  If you really want a relationship, which you're telling us today, in between your tears.  You know what I think it is?  And I'm really, it's either that I'm way, way, way too picky or have this fantasy.  Part of me is pissed off that I was lied to my whole life by everybody, from the people  in my life to the people, my protectors or whatever. 
[03:30:30]  About being adopted?  No, no, no, no.  I was told that from the beginning.  They told you you had shoulders your whole life?  Yeah, that.  Yeah.  And you believed that?  Everybody that tried to make me believe I was straight, you know, it bothers me.  No, but seriously, it's like, it's...  What do they lie to you about?  I'm very bothered that I was raised very Catholic, and it bothers me that I was sold this bill  of goods that this Save the Princess, Prince Charming, Night in Shining, whatever you want  to call it, fairytale idea of romantic love existed. 
[03:31:00]  And I really, really believed in it.  And then it's the same thing that when you're 25 and you go, this is fucked up.  I don't know if I believe in God.  And you really struggle with that.  I struggled with the belief in romantic love in the same way, where I was like, this  does not exist the way it was taught to me.  I have to learn to accept the reality of this.  And it freaked me the fuck out.  And it's been very, very hard for me to deal with.  And I think that I went very rebellious in the other direction with sex and promiscuity 
[03:31:30]  and, you know, sexual experimentation, not in the sense of men and women, but in the  sense of, like, trying to do everything I could with a girl and get into all kinds of  new shit and whatever.  And I know there's still three more circles of hell for me to fucking travel down into.  You know, but the point is, is that you get sold this bill of goods and it fucked me up.  And this thing that I think is out there or thought was out there isn't out there.  That's the first thing. 
[03:32:00]  The second thing is, I think I do have a healthy sense of independence and I'm not codependent  to a fault.  I'm codependent to an extent as anybody is, but not to a fault.  And I think I've afforded myself the luxury of being a little picky and saying, well, look,  this girl is beautiful and she is nice, but she's not exciting.  She doesn't, there's nothing riveting about her.  You know, you know, whereas this girl's really hot and really fun, but she's fucking nuts.  So no to that.  And I'm just trying to find the one. 
[03:32:30]  Just keep pulling the handle on the slot machine waiting for all the fucking chicks  to a line.  Exactly.  The slot machine is a great analogy because that's what you want is a balance of sevens.  Like, oh, I got, oh no, I got two sevens, but I got a lemon.  You want a balance of sevens.  You don't want a perfect ten.  You want a balance of sevens.  Yeah.  She's pretty.  You have to find a nice one that you make crazy.  And then you could just turn it on and off.  Like, look how nice she is, but I can say one thing and she'll turn crazy.  And then, and that's bad advice. 
[03:33:00]  They're all a little batshit crazy though, these girls.  Patrice gave me.  Notice that.  Anything you're about to say cannot be true.  Yeah.  You're about to say Patrice gave you decent advice?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It started with, it has to do with an animal analogy of some kind.  The advice started with, uh, you faggot.  And then, uh, and then it went on from there.  He's very compelling and very, uh, wise man.  Yes.  He did say something interesting to me once where he said, he goes, he goes, this is the  problem with, with white guys.  He goes, you're all, you're all out there looking for the one. 
[03:33:30]  You think you're going to find this perfect girl.  And he goes, it doesn't work like that.  You got to find a girl and you, you slowly, you know, get her pregnant, leave her, find  another girl, get her pregnant, leave her, find enough.  It was that the advice that white guys aren't doing enough of Jesus.  There it is.  There's ants.  I was, I stole that from Gallagher.  What was the rest of the advice?  Well, it was sort of what you were just saying is like, you find a girl and slowly you kind 
[03:34:00]  of, you, you, she adapts to what you want and you maybe adapt a little bit to what she  wants.  And you added that part, but you, the part about you adapting to her, I added, you're  right.  You're right.  You're right.  I swear I did.  I really did.  That's not Patrice.  I just was trying to, I wish we could help you Joe, but, uh, show's over.  Yeah.  It would be so nice to really help you sort out your mental problems.  We got things to do.  I'll talk to you guys in a few weeks. 
[03:34:30]  We'll see where we're at.  Okay.  Yeah.  Let's see how that works.  I come back in with scabbed wrists.  Good.  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You gave us a real answer though.  That was fascinating.  It was, it was a, it was a very heartfelt, well-articulated answer.  No, is there a guilt because you're having all this crazy sex because of your upbringing  with the Catholic shit?  Once in a while that rears its head, but not as often.  But for a while, man, for a long time, when I first moved, when I moved to New York, I  had had sex with three women, all of them girlfriends in relationships. 
[03:35:00]  And then I moved here and it was all of a sudden, like by the end of the first year, it  was like, well, I'm up to 20.  You know what I mean?  Like it really shifted gears.  And for a while, I would have this weird come down after sex and, and I didn't know  what it was.  I'd be depressed and freaked the fuck out.  And like, then I realized like, oh, this is subconscious Catholic stuff from when I was  a kid.  That shit goes away.  Once I figured that out, I was able to start to fight through it.  But, um, everything goes away after a while. 
[03:35:30]  Love fades.  Everything goes away.  It does.  It's not that, uh, you know, that, that, that 16 year old high school relationship where  if, if she, she left you, you'd fucking literally put a knife through your eyeball to try to  get her back and things like that.  That's that fairytale stuff you're talking about.  And that the feeling that you get, that's all gone.  I just want, it is.  I just watched the Bill Hicks documentary and they talked about how his parents, when  he first started doing this thing on stage, his parents were like, they were saying how 
[03:36:00]  his parents were just like, you know, they just wanted to live safely in a community  and believe in their God and go to their church and not stir the pot or whatever.  And I literally was more envious of them than I was of Bill Hicks.  I was like, I wish I could just do that.  I just want to believe in a God and go live somewhere.  Just go.  It's, it's just nice.  It's nice.  It's the, it's the matrix, but whatever.  Yeah.  Ignorance is bliss.  It is like envying people that kind of are, you see as stupid sometimes.  It's like, man, that is one dumb motherfucker, but happy every day. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's not a worry in the world.  Yeah.  I'd rather be Aunt May than Spider-Man.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  You're never going to, you're never going to have that show.  No, I know.  It's never going to happen for you.  I know.  Which is why I was going to ask you if I could stay with you for a while.  We could work this, they're through together.  Just work it all out together.  Well, fuck, this was great.  Uh, Mark Maron on Twitter.  Yeah, Mark Maron. 
[03:37:00]  M-A-R-C-M-A-R-O-N.  W-T-F-Pod.com.  Yeah.  And you guys are going to be in Montreal.  Joe DeRosa Comedy on Twitter.  Yes.  Anything else, Joe?  JoeDeRosaComedy.com.  And yeah, the show on Twitter.  And, and Cheat, the movie Cheat is playing, uh, next, this coming weekend.  Excuse me.  You need a hug, Joe?  In Montreal.  You want a hug?  Uh, I don't know.  I'll hug after.  We'll hug.  Okay.  Okay.  What's this hug going to feel like?  We're both going to cry.  I'm going to cry. 
[03:37:30]  I thought that was Bob Newhart for a second.  What?  John Boehner.  It's just a horrible visual.  Down the hall, the guy with the white shirt.  Oh, that'd be great.  I'd love to talk to Newhart.  Have you guys talked to Newhart?  I did backstage.  Not on the radio.  This looks like some of the guys that are going to buy the company.  Ronnie B.  Yeah, someone's buying this place.  It's obvious.  Got it.  I don't know for sure, but I would imagine that's what's going on.  This one really great.  Ronnie B.  Did an unmasked with Bob Newhart, and I got to talk to him in the dressing room.  Fuck.  Yeah, that must have been good.  It was awesome.  Did he talk to you on a fake telephone? 
[03:38:00]  I was just going to say, this would be a great conversation to have Bob Newhart and I...  Bob, do you ever get depressed after you cum?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah, I just, I came, and I need my pills now.  He's the best.  All right, Mark, don't be a fucking stranger, man.  All right, I'll come in every time I'm here.  Every time I'm here.  Yeah, please do that.  And we're going to do the podcast.  Yes.  Only if you guys have some stuff you have hidden. 
[03:38:30]  I want hidden stuff.  Very cool.  Hidden secretive stuff that we've kept under wraps.  After all these years, that would be tough, but we'll figure some out.  All right.  Jim Gordon back tomorrow.  We'll talk about Comic-Con, and I don't know.  All right.  Enjoy your day.  Yeah, you're right.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I'm back.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:39:00]  I'm back from San Diego.  I was at Comic-Con since, what, Wednesday night.  Uh, Roland.  Yes.  You did a good job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I mean, we'll get into the whole, everything, because Jim, I went, obviously, with Norton,  uh, to Comic-Con, uh, and there was a lot of Sirius representation there, because they  were doing their whole Comic-Con radio channel, which I think is running through tomorrow,  so it's on channel 141, uh, on both Sirius and XM, if you haven't heard it yet. 
[03:39:30]  They're, uh, and I mean, they did a good job of getting everybody, and, uh, a bunch of  my interviews are sprinkled in there and all over the channel.  Now, but Roland, if you remember, and we'll talk about it again, we'll do the whole Comic-Con  thing.  Jesus Christ.  I know you're a little bit rusty now.  We'll do, yeah, exactly.  We'll do the whole Comic-Con thing, uh, tomorrow, more in depth, because Norton will be here.  Yeah.  We can go over everything, but, I mean, you remember, you weren't here when we went last 
[03:40:00]  year, but you were listening.  I was listening to him screaming, or you guys were in the parking lot.  But, exactly, last year was a complete disaster.  I don't want to give too much away.  It was a dick in the ass.  About what happened this year.  But last year, I think everybody should remember, I hope, was a complete disaster.  Uh, it ended up being good for the air.  Oh, yeah.  Because, but, I think a lot of people, uh, were not happy with a lot of things that happened  last year.  Uh, not a lot of, uh, interviewing going on last year. 
[03:40:30]  A lot of, uh.  Hanging out.  A lot of hanging out.  Yeah, a lot of going to, uh, uh, press events that were meant for bloggers.  Uh, it was a very interesting trip, and, and made for great stuff when we got back.  But, the full Comic Con report will be on the air tomorrow.  I mean, I just like going on trips for free.  So, I mean, I was, I was good.  LA for the heat wave?  San Diego.  San Diego for the heat wave?  Yeah, it was amazing.  Like, I got back here, and, uh, and Jess was like, you know, it's been 100 degrees every 
[03:41:00]  day, and I go, what are you talking about?  It was just 80 degrees yesterday.  No.  Not in New York.  Nice ocean breeze.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  And then I was driving to Norton's hotel, and his hotel was literally on the ocean.  So, Norton would be like, I'll be like 10 minutes, I'll be downstairs.  I go, no problem.  Just walk out to the beach.  The ocean.  The breeze.  It was great.  It was fantastic.  But, you know what, Roland?  You know what's even better?  What?  Being back here with everybody.  I'm just so happy to be back.  Uh, Travis didn't, uh, A-Rock, you're in here now. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  What are you?  He says no.  No.  I'm not.  Uh.  Um, was he looking for bacon?  Oh, Jesus.  It looked like he was looking for food.  He was like, no, food.  Because he had a slim fast or slim slow drink in the office.  Slim slow?  Yeah.  He was like drinking it.  He has, it replaces a meal.  Well, unfortunately, though.  In 10 minutes, I'm going to ask him, why don't we have lunch?  And I go, yeah.  No.  No, unfortunately, E-Rock drinks slim fast, and he replaces water with slim fast.  So he eats his breakfast and has a slim fast with it. 
[03:42:00]  And like a slim slow.  Slim slow.  Travis, didn't Opie have a meeting with Bladder today?  Uh, you know, I saw Opie heading towards the door, so I don't know.  Yeah, because he said on the air that he had this meeting that just him and Steve, our boss,  and I was in the bathroom with him, and he was talking about how tired he was, and then  he goes out into the lobby, and like he's a spy, starts looking around to see who's around  out the door.  I'll tell you, I was the only one waiting outside the studio to say something today, so. 
[03:42:30]  They took his, yeah.  I think they may have.  If you missed the first hour, I would listen to it on the replay, because, um, it wasn't,  Opie wasn't in a good mood.  I think he was very cranky, because he hadn't slept, he said, and so, uh.  Plus the heat, though, he went out walking.  The heat, yeah, exactly.  He'd been exercising.  Management took a beat, and I mean, they didn't even do anything this time.  Like, something, like, today, management didn't do anything wrong, did they, Roland?  No. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, what did they, I mean, Travis, do you have any idea what, it just came out, kind of out  of nowhere.  Whatever we answer now, we're going to be talked about to in the meeting.  So, I say no.  I think, I think it was more of a, of a weekend of letting his, whatever email he sent just  fester.  Oh, okay.  That's what I think.  And then he comes back, because let me tell you, it did not, Monday was not a happy way  to start the week on this show.  Uh, but again, you know, check out the replay.  Also, uh, while we're talking about what happened on today's show, before we get into some of the 
[03:43:30]  behind the scenes stuff, how great was Don Cheadle on the show today?  Roland, did you book that?  Well, he only wanted to do, uh, Sway.  But he was on the show today.  He was?  Yeah.  Really?  I was in the bathroom.  Well, he was on the show today.  Oh.  He was on the show today.  Oh, really?  He was out there.  Yeah, Sway is the new Shade 45 morning.  Yeah, he was on MTV.  Every time I see him, I just want to be like, what up, world?  Sway! 
[03:44:00]  Hey, Sway.  Oh, no, he's up by Cheadle?  Why don't you, you should book Sway to come in here.  Or, I mean, I know he's on the air right now, but he plays music.  Right?  Uh, I think he does talk, too.  You're afraid to go over there.  You are.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  Listen, uh, I wanted to...  Is he still on the air?  Yeah.  I saw an engineer in there and nobody else.  Well, I saw, when I went to the...  They moved the whole Shade 45 crew is in another studio right now.  Oh, okay.  So I don't know if their studio just stopped working or something.  Yeah, I know, because his producer, I mean... 
[03:44:30]  If his producer pops out, I'll ask him.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should come on the show soon.  Did Shida come by today or not?  Yes, he did.  He was in studio for all of, uh, five seconds.  Oh, really?  He just stopped in and said hello and then, uh, he got pulled back out.  Because, yeah, he was here for Sway.  Yeah.  But, see, I was going to say, uh, you know, talk it up like it was a real appearance.  Uh.  And then people would listen to the replay and be like, oh, Sam.  But then, I mean, you didn't even realize.  I was...  I was...  It's not my fault because they blocked the hallway.  You just have to run around a longer loop to go to the bathroom. 
[03:45:00]  Right.  So the loop, I missed it.  And was it one or two in the bathroom?  Dude, it was two.  It was.  I went to 37.  That's how ashamed I was.  Wow.  I wish Eric was here because I just remembered that on Wednesday, the day that I was leaving  for San Diego on the after show, we talked about my mother for most of the time, who,  by the way, actually called me while I was in San Diego and asked, uh, Jim didn't get  you any prostitutes, did he?  Nice. 
[03:45:30]  Which, I mean, if he had, I probably wouldn't have mentioned it to her.  So it was a silly question.  But, uh, we were talking about you destroying Eric's office and really didn't even get to  it.  We spent like two minutes on the fact that you smeared fries all over his keyboard or something.  That is false.  I smeared fries grease.  There were potatoes in his keyboards.  But my best is when he emailed Travis and, uh, Bruce's security to report vandalism.  Well, I think he's recording something with, uh, Mark Marin right now.  No, I saw him, uh, walk with Mark in, in another direction. 
[03:46:00]  So he's pretending that he needs to be his liaison.  Oh God.  Roland.  What?  Did you hear Travis just said he's walking with Mark in another direction, pretending he  needs to be his liaison.  Wouldn't that be your job?  Aren't you the talent booker?  Or does Eric try to just jump on that?  Well, I think he got energy with his thumb faster.  Oh Jesus.  Has a lot of sugar.  Has like 80 grams of sugar.  Like, really?  Yeah.  He's like, why do you have so much energy?  Well, listen, Mark Marin was on the show today and, uh, we were talking to him a little 
[03:46:30]  bit about when Gallagher was on his WTF podcast and walked off because, uh, Mark made, didn't  make accusations, asked him, I guess, about being racist.  And, uh, Gallagher didn't like it.  If you missed the description, if you want to hear that podcast, we would play it for  you here, but it's premium content and I'm not going to pay for a podcast for you to listen  to it.  If it were a free download on Mark Marin's website, I would have downloaded it and played  the clip for you right here, but you can go pay to hear it yourself on Mark Marin's 
[03:47:00]  website.  The website is WTFpod.com.  Uh, and he puts up all his WTF podcasts.  If you haven't heard it, you should, because it's really good, especially for you guys out  there.  Obviously, if you're listening to this show, you love comedians and, uh, it's a lot of  comedians being interviewed, but Gallagher was on Opie and Anthony several times.  And, uh, Roland, actually, you told a story today about him claiming that we were trying  to kill him because he got so stressed out. 
[03:47:30]  But, uh, Patrice O'Neill was on with Gallagher one day and, uh, well, he let Gallagher know,  um, that the race, that Mark Marin's not the only one who's heard that Gallagher's racist  and Patrice just decided to go on the rant.  Uh, Travis, you have the five minute.  Uh, no, I've got the, oh, I have 10 minutes and 39 seconds.  Eric cut a 550 version.  All right, let me find it.  Hang on.  I figured I'd tell you that way.  Because he didn't.  He didn't tell you.  No, why would he?  He just gave me the paper and then he walked off with Mark Marin? 
[03:48:00]  Yep.  Well, I can't play them out of here.  I have to host the show.  He doesn't know that.  He's never ran the board for the show, right?  No, he's here every day.  Oh.  Yeah, I got it.  Okay.  Uh, this is, uh, Gallagher's last appearance and he won't come in after this, right, Roland?  No.  Remember last time at K-Rock, he stayed like five hours after the show ended?  Day trading with no shirt on.  He refused to leave.  He's a psychopath.  This was his last appearance.  Uh, Patrice was too much for Gallagher. 
[03:48:30]  And here it is.  On After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  But hold on, let's get into this.  Gallagher feels like he has to make a statement.  I think he doesn't like us.  I don't think he's coming back.  You think migger farts are, uh, contributing to global warming?  Jesus, Patrice.  Gallagher's going to explain.  I think black people have more gas than most.  Let Gallagher explain.  He felt like he was in a spot.  From their diet.  Right.  Here's a fart.  All those pork chops are stinking up the earth, right, Gallagher?  Leo.  I do a fart. 
[03:49:00]  I do a fart joke, but I do a different one.  Why don't little girls...  How many of us take...  Hold on, let him do a fart joke.  I want to know how many light bulbs...  How many of me's it takes to screw in a fucking light bulb?  Let him do his fart joke.  All right, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I'm trying to get back on his good side, because he fucking is giving me the daggers  right now.  Go ahead, Gallagher.  Why don't little girls fart?  Because they don't get assholes until they get married.  Now, this gets all the girls.  Yeah, the guys love that, right?  Yes, they do.  And the guys are like... 
[03:49:30]  It's a good fart joke, instead of just saying what you said.  How about this...  Wait, but how about this joke about girls?  Yeah.  My girlfriend has been with me for eight years.  I've been with her for three.  Gallagher?  He's thinking...  How's that one?  I guess that's what black people do.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Told you.  This...  No.  This is the new Gallagher.  I like it.  I don't think his real name is Gallagher. 
[03:50:00]  I like this Gallagher.  Gallagher's mad at...  This is the true Leo.  But he's mad at me because I asked that question before break.  Here's why he's upset, because he knows...  But let him talk about it.  Fuck that.  He is the Hulk, and you brought in the thing that makes him change.  He's a wolf, man, and you brought a full moon in.  Well, he said my mom fucked a Viking.  Well, imagine what he thinks my mom fucked.  Holy... 
[03:50:30]  At least it has king in it.  Yo, it's mine.  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  Yours has king in it, too.  Yours...  Oh, my God.  I want...  I don't want Gallagher leaving and never coming back.  So, Gallagher...  Why was that question bad?  Well, I guess you'll have either an Oriental or a gay comic on next time, and I'll have to deal with that. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, shit.  We talk race all the time on this show.  We do.  We do talk a lot about race.  I didn't know.  I was on two days ago, and we didn't discuss it.  No, because it's not an everyday thing.  We kind of just...  We're all over the place, but it's...  Race only comes up every other day.  It's whatever...  It's a very kind of...  For real?  Whatever the world is talking about thing, and in this day and age, political correctness  is, like, really a big thing.  And we talk about that.  We talk about sex.  We talk about toilet habits.  We'll talk about anything.  But race is kind of a big thing, especially in this day and age, with Obama being president. 
[03:51:30]  It was a big issue.  There was a report, a little story, about Jimmy the Greek on during the football.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We just played this clip.  We did Jimmy the Greek.  Did you flick around?  I was interested in what the networks played against that game, trying to get attention.  Because they did the Bourne, whatever it is, Odyssey or whatever.  Yeah, there's like three or four of them.  Bourne Identity.  They did that.  I love that movie.  I watch it every time.  So I watched that and the football game. 
[03:52:00]  It was kind of a pitiful game.  I didn't watch the football game, no.  Well, I wanted to know who won.  I like crime shows.  I saw him get hit in the back, but it didn't look like it hurt him that bad.  His arm went to sleep.  It had to hurt, though, right?  No, it was just a little hit.  It was just a little hit.  But I guess they put him out.  They could have had that as a strategy.  We're not going to come back from what happened before the break, huh?  I was just looking at Sam's hair.  Yeah, Sam's hair, by the way.  The pit's over and we got nothing accomplished. 
[03:52:30]  It's a cross between Frederick Douglass and it actually looks like Adolf Hitler.  It does.  A little, but...  Yeah, hey, there you go.  Oh, shit.  Really?  No blacks or Jews at my show.  Oh, no.  You do have a very specific demographic to your audience.  I've noticed that, too.  Yeah, smart.  Yeah, okay.  That's one way to put it.  Patrice isn't talking anymore.  It is funny watching the guys with the dry look from Gillette hair and the big 70s porno mustaches and stuff. 
[03:53:00]  I think it's interesting to look at the audience when you go there and go, wow.  People come up to me and they say, we were stoned when we watched your show.  And I said, I was, too.  And that's where the jokes came from.  If your knee's bent the other way, what would a chair look like?  What makes Teflon stick to the pan?  So no more French people at your shows now.  No more French words in my mouth.  You can't go out to eat without speaking French.  There's a restaurant, a buffet, a cafe, a cabaret. 
[03:53:30]  There's a valet.  There's a maitre d'.  You can order a la carte or get the soup du jour.  I start every day with a latte and a croissant and I don't like it.  That's a Carlin thing right there.  It's French.  Good stuff.  It's an observation.  That's why I said Carlin.  He was the king of the observation.  Well, people don't realize that there's...  Oh, wow.  I'm just asking about Africa.  You asked about China and fucking France.  I'm just saying.  That's a continent, not a country.  That's right.  How about fucking Nigeria?  Oh, we all hate that place. 
[03:54:00]  What's their major export?  I hate Nigeria, too.  Scams?  And the emails about how they've got some money they need to get out of the bank.  That's what I just said.  Why are you getting mad?  I don't know.  I guess it wasn't clear.  It wasn't clear.  All right.  How are we going to get everyone on the same page again, Gallagher?  We're on the same page.  If Gallagher just stop his racism for four seconds, we can love each other.  That was amazing.  Oh, shit.  Giving you a...  I've never seen a look like that.  After ONA. 
[03:54:30]  Live.  And it just went on and on and on.  Patrice just hammering him to the point that there...  I mean, there's no way we're going to get Gallagher back in here.  But, I mean, I feel like how could this many people accuse you of being a racist if you're  not kind of a racist?  Yeah.  Plus, I think the guys did everything they could with Gallagher, so I was like...  The guys what?  Did everything they could with Gallagher.  Yeah, he smashed stuff twice.  You know, he acted like a crazy person. 
[03:55:00]  Like, we did it.  We got the clips where we want to air some more Gallagher stuff.  We're all good.  Roland, you brought some friends.  Yes, yes.  Big guests to get, I say.  Well, these are the Ron and Fez interns.  Yeah.  And their cohort, a.k.a.  the intern boss, Mark Zito.  Okay, well, I don't know.  Ron and Fez are not...  Mark Zito's not here.  Ron and Fez are off.  That's what he forgot to tell them.  Wait, wait, wait.  What? 
[03:55:30]  They said that Mark Zito told them we're going to be off this week, which was last week.  Uh-huh.  And then he forgot to...  He felt to mention to his own interns not to come in today.  But you guys weren't off all week last week.  No, we were in Monday and Tuesday, and then we had Wednesday, Thursday, Friday off.  Yeah.  So he said you guys were off the rest of the week.  In which is...  This week's a new week.  In a way, yeah.  He's like, yeah, you got the week off.  I'm not saying it's his fault.  I'm not going to give a name.  It is Mark...  What do you mean you're not going to give a name?  Roland just gave the name.  I know, but I'm not going to say it. 
[03:56:00]  I think...  What's his name?  That's an intern no name.  I'm no name.  I don't have a name.  No wonder.  I think Mark Zito was so happy to be with Taylor Swift last night.  Oh my god.  He forgot to tell his interns not to come in.  He was dancing in the aisles.  What's your intern name?  Mine's Pips.  Pips, you got a little more confidence in you, like you could say.  I'm going to call Zito.  You are?  Well, he may be having a Taylor Swift dream, so be careful.  Pips. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  So Zito told you guys, you got the week off.  Yeah.  And you both, obviously, did you call each other to say what did he mean, or did you both  just assume that meant...  We figured that we have the rest of the week off.  They're taking off.  And I even thought, like, three days is kind of weird, but I get it.  It's the end of the week, you know, makes like a five-day weekend.  Yeah.  And five days is a week.  Yeah.  You got the week off.  And we'll be back Monday.  Of course.  And I think it was just bad wording.  You know what I mean?  Like, he just didn't word it right.  He's saying he's retarded.  Mark Zito.  So.  I agree. 
[03:57:00]  Is Ron and Fez on tomorrow?  We don't know.  I don't know either.  I just thought Monday, so I was like, oh, yeah, all right.  I got to wake up early for tomorrow.  Time to go to work.  Time to go back to work.  And what time did you guys wake up?  6 a.m.  6.  You both went up at 6.  Yep.  Is Taylor Swift playing tonight?  Zito will be there.  Yes.  Do you guys usually wake up at 6, like on your off days?  Hell no.  No.  I wake up mostly around, like, 8.30 or 9.  What about you, Pips?  It depends on the day.  Some days it's 1 p.m.  That's right. 
[03:57:30]  Because you party sometimes.  I like him.  He's out there.  He's like, you know, no name on the other hand.  He's kind of like a little bit of a geek.  Oh, you mean 11, Eric?  You can say it on the air.  11.  Sorry.  Mark Zito.  Hi, Sam.  Hey, you're, I, listen, I'm going to tell you this for the record, because I have a reputation  around here.  I will allow it to happen, but.  Sam.  Roland.  I did not do this.  You saw your interns out in the hallway? 
[03:58:00]  That is not true.  Roland.  You already said it on the air.  That was a bit you told me to say.  Roland saw your interns out in the hallway, and he brought them in because your interns  say that you told them they had the week off last week, and now they're here, wondering  why nobody else is here.  They're both here.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's like, fuck my life.  And then Roland started making fun of you for going to Taylor Swift last night.  Taylor Swift was, like, pretty awesome. 
[03:58:30]  I mean, I'm sure she's good.  I'm a big fan of hers.  I have all the albums, so, I mean, I can't make fun of you for going to see Taylor Swift,  but I can make fun.  I guess it's the interns say you're the one who kind of tells them when they're supposed  to come in and stuff?  Yeah, I mean, I thought they knew, but.  They don't.  Apparently not.  They want to know if they come in tomorrow.  Yeah, they don't know.  Pips, you want to ask?  Yes, you know, like, we thought we had the week off, which was last week, and this week 
[03:59:00]  we have no idea when we're even coming back.  Like, are we off tomorrow?  Yeah.  What about Wednesday?  No.  No, okay.  So it was the exact week from Wednesday to Wednesday?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Well, they just, they wanted that cleared up.  Now, Pips was not, like, throwing you under the bus, but he was being honest, like, yeah,  Mark never told us, we all got confused, whereas No Name was like, oh, I don't want to say  anybody did anything wrong, I don't want to mention anybody. 
[03:59:30]  So.  Will Mark be reimbursing them for coming in today?  Oh, yeah, did you guys have.  That was E-Rock, by the way, Mark, I'm sure you heard him.  No Name had to pay the most, because he has to come from Jersey.  How much do you have to pay, to and from?  I pay 20 bucks for the ferry.  A day?  Yeah.  Wow.  What about you, Pips?  I take the Q, so it's, you know, Metro card, like two bucks.  Still, two dollars.  So, I mean, are you asking No Name?  No, I'm not asking.  I don't ask.  He's telling.  Pips, are you going to ask? 
[04:00:00]  I'm not asking, I'm telling you.  You're going to ask for the two, though.  Oh, hell yeah.  Okay.  Mark, will you give Pips his two dollars back?  Super money, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay, you can get the two back, but.  Well, it's four each way, right?  Oh, four?  Yeah, I need the four.  But, I mean, No Name didn't ask, so Zito, you don't have to give No Name the ferry money.  That's ridiculous.  He's not going to ask for it.  He's not going to get it.  I'm not going to ask.  Well, I get, I, are you, is this how you're waking up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, look, I can't say I'm upset that this happened, but Roland brought your guys in. 
[04:00:30]  I did not.  And then.  Sam shit stirred again.  And then Eric, you know, you, Eric did the right thing, and he said, I'm going to produce  the shit out of the after show today, and I'm going to give Zito a call, which, Eric.  That is true.  I'll say this.  Good job, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  So, um, I guess, was there anything else you, I mean, Pips, No Name, do you guys?  Well, when we were upstairs waiting in the office, I guess they're not coming in today.  How long were you waiting in the office for? 
[04:01:00]  Till, like, ten.  What time did you get to the office?  Nine.  So, you were up there for an hour?  Yeah.  Just sitting there.  And I got there at 8.30, so I was there.  So, you were there for an hour and a half.  And then we found out that, all right, yeah, they're not coming in.  We have a day off.  It's still a vacation, so.  We were thinking, like, it's Monday.  You know, they probably had a rough night.  They were out doing something.  They'll come in a little bit later.  Right.  But then when Ten Hittin' Fez wasn't there, I was like, oh, shit.  Like, this is bullshit right now.  I suggested, like, why don't we just still set up the studio and just host the show? 
[04:01:30]  Can they do that, Mark?  No.  No?  Okay.  You got your answer there.  So, I guess, what are you guys going to do for the rest of the day?  You're up.  The fuck should I know?  I don't know, man.  I will go up at 6 on a vacation, and I'm just going to, like, walk my way to the nearest  bar and drink myself drunk like a broken man.  Your whole life's a vacation.  You're in fucking college.  And he just said, Mark, you know how you could tell he doesn't drink ever?  He just said, I'm going to go to the bar and drink myself drunk.  Drink myself drunk. 
[04:02:00]  Who's ever said, drink myself drunk?  Yeah.  You get shit-faced.  You know what you guys should do?  And I think, personally, that Mark Zito taught you guys a lesson that maybe even on your days  that, look, Mark Zito's up and ready to go.  He's ready to go on the air anytime.  You guys maybe should realize that just because it's a vacation day, it's still a Monday, and  people wake up.  They make the most of the days.  You guys, you, no-name, should not go out there and drink yourself drunk, whatever that 
[04:02:30]  means.  And you guys should both go out there and really conquer the day.  Carpe diem.  You know what I mean?  You have now, it's only 10.35 in the morning, or in case they're listening on the replay,  35 after the hour.  Oh, yeah.  It's still early in the day, though.  You guys should go out there and really conquer something and really get something accomplished,  don't you think?  Yeah, man.  Mark, wasn't this your plan from the beginning?  Oh, yeah.  See?  He wants you to make the most out of your lives. 
[04:03:00]  And he knew that if he just told you guys you were on vacation, that you'd end up sleeping  till 1 p.m., and then no-name would get up at 8.30 and drink himself drunk.  But the difference would be I'd be out Sunday night doing something instead of going, hey,  guys, I gotta go home.  I gotta work tomorrow.  You guys should go fuck yourselves.  I can't go out right now.  So you ruined your Sunday night plan.  What were you doing?  Nothing, because I didn't go out.  What would you have done?  I usually just go to the bar or the strip club or something.  Nice.  Yeah.  And you ruined that.  Yeah.  But then again, the strip clubs in Brooklyn, some of them are just disgusting. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  Like, I don't even know why we'd go.  There's no reason to go.  No.  They're just nasty.  It's just, I don't have to work in the morning, so I gotta fill these night hours with something.  Yeah.  And no name?  I was stuck visiting my girlfriend in Kansas.  Bumfuck Kansas.  You were stuck?  Why?  Just stop dating her then.  No.  It's that much of a hassle.  I mean, like, I was to visit her.  I was hanging out with my girlfriend last night.  You know why?  Because I voluntarily live with her.  I made the conscious choice.  Was she interning for a barbecue or what? 
[04:04:00]  Some food health management at the university there.  That's a long way for pussy, man.  It really is.  Especially if you're stuck there.  You'd think you'd be enjoying yourself.  She was the best part of the trip, but just Kansas is not really for me.  Why?  Not at all.  It's just really, they move really slow.  What?  Maybe.  What'd you say?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, right?  I'll drink myself drunk.  Why do you say it with a southern?  You're the one who said drink yourself drunk.  You said it like southern people say that and they're dumb. 
[04:04:30]  You said it.  I know I did.  Okay.  I just came from Kansas.  Well, yeah, I know.  You just slept in today, too.  Listen, Zito, to tell you the truth, I think you should tell them that now we are going  to do it.  You just have them come in here every day, even whether there's a show or not, because  they need this in their lives.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Oh, guys, today it's cool if you want to carry the bins back.  Awesome.  Awesome.  All right.  Well, Zito, thank you for allowing us to wake you up. 
[04:05:00]  No problem.  Have a good one.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  We're going to get reamed out on Wednesday.  You know that.  Are you?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I don't know what goes on in your life.  It's going to be, what the fuck, man?  He just woke up like, oh, fuck my life.  Well, I mean.  No, he didn't say that.  He saw Taylor Swift.  The hard night at Taylor Swift picking up underage girls.  But shit rolls downhill, too.  So if Zito ends up getting reamed out, you guys should get reamed out, right?  He also Twittered that he walked out when she sang her anti-John Mayer song. 
[04:05:30]  Like, he was all disgusted.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Look, I'm all.  She did sing the Bruce Springsteen song, Dancing in the Darker Heard.  I'm all for making fun of people, especially Mark Zito.  I don't have any problem with it.  But Eric and Roland cannot make fun of Mark Zito for seeing Taylor Swift.  Why?  No, I'm not making fun of him for seeing Taylor Swift.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why?  I'm laughing that he walked out on that song because it was anti-John Mayer.  So you're okay with the Taylor Swift thing?  No, I don't know.  Why can't I make fun of him?  Why can't you make fun?  Because you wrote on your Twitter that you had seen the Justin Timberlake movie twice over the weekend. 
[04:06:00]  That is correct.  That's so much worse.  It's fantastic.  It was fun.  It was a great movie.  I'm sure it wasn't.  It was.  What's the movie called, Eric?  Do you remember what the movie is called?  I have no.  Friends with Benefits.  Of course.  It's not even an original title.  FWB.  Oh, I thought you were talking about that movie he put out, that concert thing.  They had a big display at Best Buy.  There's some big DVD that he put out.  I thought that was what you saw.  No, no, no.  Roland went to see the Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis movie, Friends with Benefits.  Oh, okay. 
[04:06:30]  And he thinks that Mark Zito is feminine for going to see Taylor Swift, but you were just the beacon of masculinity over the weekend.  You've been to sweet kids.  Justin Timberlake, Chick Flake.  Was he acting good?  It was funny.  He was funny.  He wasn't funny.  He was funny.  Like, Justin Timberlake is the quintessential guy who tries to be the funny guy in the room, but you know he can't take a joke.  Like, do you think somebody could go and make fun of Justin Timberlake?  Yes.  J.T.  J.T.  J.T.  J.T.  I forgot he's your boy because he's friends with Carson. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, he's funny.  Yeah, he's not funny.  He was funny.  Mila Kunis was hot and funny.  Special cameos with Jason Segel, Rashida Jones.  Why is Jason Segel in that movie?  You gotta see it.  It's good.  Oh, I'm not going to see it.  Eric.  I was trying to get you a guess, but it's not working out.  Was it Sway?  No.  Why don't you give me Sway?  You want to talk to Sway?  Of course I do.  All right, let me see.  He just walked by the studio.  Yeah, but I think his morning show is still on.  Yeah, the guess he won when I come in here. 
[04:07:30]  No.  They play music.  We tried.  What guess?  She said no way.  Who?  Do you know the name Clarissa Darling?  Oh, my God.  Why won't Melissa Joan Hart come in here?  Well, she's in without you right now, but she was waiting in the hallway for a few minutes  because they were in commercials or whatever.  I was trying to see if we could get her in just to say hi, but it didn't work out.  Yeah.  Her pup says,  This is a very sort of...  You're very safe.  Yeah, very safe interview here.  It's not good, huh?  You think they have a bad reputation, Opie and Anthony?  No, no.  Just her publicist thinks you guys are going to like show you her. 
[04:08:00]  She's like, hey, look, there's my cock.  Does she know that they're not here?  I don't know.  Plus, in one interview have Opie and Anthony ever gone, hey, look, here's my cock.  Never, no, but some of them have that projection of Chuck Shockery in their mind.  I see.  But they don't, nothing happens.  I mean, more stuff happens in like the matchup, like asking controversial questions.  Do they?  Yeah.  Like they pick on the topic of what's going on. 
[04:08:30]  Oh, because...  Oh, the rumors and all that.  I got you.  And they go...  Yeah, the guys are really like, oh, whatever.  Then they just do the great interview, but they go...  The other one's like, oh, we heard the rumor.  You banged XXX.  I'm like, oh.  We should...  Well, real quick, I want to touch on it because we barely scratched the surface on it.  Eric, now that you're back in the booth...  Yeah.  We really only scratched the surface on Wednesday when I was leaving for San Diego about...  What's wrong, Roland?  Oh, no. 
[04:09:00]  About Roland destroying your area.  Oh, yes.  But in my defense, though, I was high on sugar.  That's not a defense.  No, it's not a defense at all.  I guess...  That doesn't intoxicate you in any way.  It doesn't seem crazy.  What happened was Tuesday, Eric, you decided to take a little early day for yourself?  I was done with what I needed to do.  I went home.  Good for you.  So he took the day...  He must have gone home around 1045.  I actually don't even know if he was here for the end of the after show that day. 
[04:09:30]  Nope.  But he was gone out the door.  Roland and me went to Wendy's.  And Troy Kwan.  Oh, yeah.  And Troy went with us.  And then Roland got rambunctious and started smearing...  Using french fries to smear the grease for no reason all over Eric's desk.  Yes.  His keyboard.  His keyboard.  And the keyboard he smushed the fries into.  Correct, Eric?  I had to pretty much disconnect it, turn it upside down, and bang it until the keys fell 
[04:10:00]  off just to get the french fry mush out of it.  I bought him lunch, though.  Who cares?  It was on my mouse, it greased papers and discs that were on my desk, and the grease was  also on the monitor.  I had grease hands.  That's right.  He did take a french fry.  I turned the monitor on, and there's all these rainbow streaks all over the monitor.  Because you smeared french fry grease on his computer monitor.  Remember I said, like, grease hands, grease hands.  Why did you do that?  Because I went crazy.  I had the extra large Mr. Pibb. 
[04:10:30]  I had the ice cream with that sugar.  Yeah.  I just started, like, going crazy.  Eric, isn't Roland supposed to be, like, your best friend in the office?  Yeah, Roland's a dick.  And, Roland, you enjoyed it, correct?  Well, the thing is, I started, I go, I should do this.  I go, I shouldn't do it.  And then I hear Sam, do it.  Do it.  You didn't, no.  That's not how it happened.  You started doing it, and I laughed, so you continued doing it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Should I play your fat cramp video again?  Oh, Roland doesn't like that. 
[04:11:00]  I should, why, why did you do it?  Just because, I was, and why did you fess up to it?  Because, um, I heard, um, Travis goes, hey, yeah, um, Eric sent an email to, um, Travis,  I believe, Gary, Rob, and security that he's still vandalized.  And I said, I, is that true, Eric?  Um, well, first I sent a notice to, uh, Pepper and Zito, because I noticed the profit machine  was on, so I figured they were down there using the machine, which is fine, they're allowed 
[04:11:30]  to, but there was food everywhere, so I asked them, I'm like, did you guys do this?  If not, that's fine.  Oh, you blamed the Ron and Fez crew.  No, I didn't blame them.  I asked them.  I said, if you didn't do it, that's fine.  I'm going to have to check with security and see what the hell happened.  Oh!  And then, Travis was aware.  So you basically said, listen, Ron and Fez crew, did you mess up my office?  If you lie about it, I'm going to narc you out.  I'm going to tell security.  I messed them nicely, and if they said, no, that's fine, I was going to have to find out 
[04:12:00]  who did it, because it was all over everything.  And to find a fact, I did wake up late that day, they came in, and I forgot all about it.  Well, wait, wait, wait, let me explain how Roland Fessed up to this.  Okay.  So I'm sitting there in the office, and I'm just like, ugh, and he's like, what?  I said, I'm explaining all this, and he's sitting there dead-faced.  I said, yeah, I have to go to security on this, and Roland just goes, oh, yeah, I did it.  Just like it's no big deal.  And then he hit me in my arm and called me a dick. 
[04:12:30]  And an asshole.  I did accept those titles.  Yeah.  You're a funny guy, Roland.  Are you ready for this staff stand-up comedy?  No.  No.  No.  It's tough, though.  I mean, what do you talk about?  Well, we're doing it at the Hard Rock, and it's on Thursday.  Thursday.  Thursday morning.  Eric, did they set up the RSVP thing while I was gone?  Yeah, I believe they did.  Do you know what it is?  It's on the Facebook page, I think.  I think it's in the promo, too.  Yeah, it's on the Facebook page. 
[04:13:00]  I heard there's been hundreds of responses.  Has there?  Yes.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony is our Facebook.  And then I think on Opie Radio, Opie Twitter, the link, too.  Okay, so check Opie's Twitter, Opie Radio, because, yeah, we're doing a live gig at the Hard Rock,  and part of that experience will be, and it's on Thursday, the staff of the show having  to go up and do stand-up comedy.  Yeah.  I know Troy is scared.  Scared?  He's acting like he's not scared, but he is. 
[04:13:30]  What's he going to do?  Well, he came up to me, and he said he doesn't even know if he's going to do it.  He might call in sick.  Oh, that's worse.  That's what I told him.  That's the worst.  I said, if you don't do it, you'll catch more shit for doing it.  That means he'll have to be here in front of, like, you can't get away with this one.  And you should just go up and do three minutes of his hardcore scream.  It's like, Eric, he wanted to do karaoke, but you had to do it.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no choice.  And he goes, I don't care about taking shit.  And I go, then why aren't you doing it?  Because you're scared. 
[04:14:00]  Because I go, seriously, guys?  Seriously?  Seriously?  Seriously?  Sneak up!  Seriously?  Seriously?  Nobody here wants to do it, but we have to do it.  Eric, are you ready?  Because you have to, I'll be as ready as I can.  Yeah, I try to write, I just got some stuff on Chipotle.  Of course you do.  Can I eat there this weekend?  Eric has to do stuff as Eric Nagel and then close the show as the virus.  Now, the virus, obviously.  Then he'll kill.  The virus, you're not preparing for at all.  When have I ever prepared for the virus?  Right.  So that's not anything you have to worry about. 
[04:14:30]  You see, Eric doesn't have an advantage, though.  He does one minute as Eric, and then he goes, all right, it's the virus.  And people go, yeah!  No, because the virus is coming later.  Oh, dude, you're fucked.  Yeah, the virus is headlining the show.  The whole staff is going up there.  Troy has to do it, because that means Eric's going twice.  Right, Eric's going twice, because the whole staff is going to be up there doing it, and  then the virus is going to close it.  And Club Soda Kenny is hosting the whole thing.  So are you going to bring it up to the guys tomorrow about Troy's fear of not doing it?  Yeah.  Maybe Troy needs to do a character, too. 
[04:15:00]  You think, what kind of, well, I mean, we'll...  I don't know, you're good at blindsiding people with characters, I'm sure you could come up  with something.  What's that supposed to mean?  What about skinny shirt guy?  Seriously?  Seriously?  Are you doing your tactic where you try to insult him until he comes down here?  No.  I mean, he's a pussy.  He won't come out here.  He's too scared.  Wow, Roland.  You are really taking some shots today.  Although...  You're off the wall.  Oh, there he comes.  Up there.  Although, you'll probably...  He'll come in here, and I'll reference this, and you'll go, oh, Sam, you slipped me  a note.  You slipped me a note? 
[04:15:30]  Troy, do you hear what Roland was just saying?  I mean, I said it, too.  Did you say fatso?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Save it for the stage, man.  Save it for the hard rock.  Yeah, that's like two seconds.  You are a little scared to do this standout.  I don't want to do it.  You're nervous.  I mean, it's not going to be good.  I'm not going to be funny.  You're nervous.  It's not going to be funny.  I don't know.  I didn't ask you.  He threw a fatso out.  That's pretty funny.  How come you won't just say, yeah, I'm scared to do this?  We all are scared. 
[04:16:00]  We're frightened.  Well, I'm a scared deer.  That's the main...  Roland just made a face of a deer in headlights with his eyes real wide.  So thank you for hearing that, Roland.  But why don't you just say, yeah, I'm scared.  Because I'm not scared to do it.  Well, yes, you are.  It's just it's not going to be funny.  I'm not scared.  Who is?  I'm not scared to get on a stage and perform.  I've done it a bazillion times.  Do you think Eric's going to be funny?  No.  Do you think Roland is?  Yes.  But we also thought he would do a good job hosting this show.  But Roland wants to be funny. 
[04:16:30]  He can be really fucking funny.  Do you think Travis is going to be funny?  Don't be diplomatic.  No.  None of us are going to be funny.  I think you could be funny.  I don't know.  You don't think you could be funny?  You're funny when you want to be funny.  I think the hard part is going to be the lineup if you're number four and the crowd's restless.  But if you're just going to go like, okay, whatever.  Who cares?  Here it is.  That's the attitude.  Why don't you be a team player?  Because I'm not ever looking to be a stand-up comedian.  It's like if you had a guitar, it's like, okay, get on stage and sing. 
[04:17:00]  You just go through it.  Because you had to do it.  You'd go through it and be like, I have no desire to be a musician.  No, but if they said we're going to have a Battle of the Bands contest with the staff,  I would go out there and perform a Junior Mint song from Embarrassing Tape Day.  And I would give it my all.  Yeah.  Well, good for you.  I have no desire to be a stand-up comedian.  What about doing something that like, okay, I'm going to go out and do my best.  I'm going to do my best.  You should be like a Stephen Lynch.  Sing a song.  Like a screaming.  Why don't you write a parody metal song?  Or a Children of the Rhymes.  Sing it.  Because I'm a J-A-E-F-G. 
[04:17:30]  I don't even know what he's talking about.  Because that would sort of be the obvious.  I think it's better to try to completely step out of your element and do something.  Did you start writing this weekend?  I have some ideas.  Here and there.  Some concepts.  We do have immunity to make fun of everybody.  Well, Roland is the only one who's obsessed with this immunity thing.  Because he thinks that it means he can make horrible jokes about our bosses.  Yeah.  One of the bosses did come to me and say, hey, just so you know, all these bosses will be in the audience.  Oh, awesome. 
[04:18:00]  I get one from me.  I take that as Roland is putting fear in him of like, some shit is really going to be sprayed.  Which I wouldn't do that anyway.  Like, I don't know.  Yeah.  But they said immunity, though.  They said, when we're on stage, a joke is a joke.  So I have a few jokes.  What Roland is forgetting to realize is, once you're off that stage, what has been said is still in their mind.  And most of the bosses that you're making jokes about, the audience has no idea who they are. 
[04:18:30]  Right.  So they're not going to laugh.  I'm playing for a niche audience.  The only people you're doing it for are the people on the staff and to just take a stab at our bosses.  I don't take stabs.  And you're not going to get in trouble, per se.  You have immunity, but they're going to be like, oh, that's that asshole who made fun of me that time.  You know what you should do, Roland?  When you get on stage, you just point to them and go, those are the guys who don't fix the online problem.  Go over there.  Just point them out.  Wow.  That's a good one.  Listen, Eric.  I'm not giving you immunity on this show. 
[04:19:00]  That's Eric Nagel.  Eric, do you have material ready for Thursday?  I will.  Do you have any concepts?  You don't have to tell me what they are because I know you're saving it.  I have a rough direction of where to go.  Okay.  But the virus is a crapshoot.  The virus is the virus.  I mean, we might have to throw a topic at you to keep it spontaneous.  Yeah.  I got a few food topics I'm going to talk about.  You can go food topics.  I got food topics.  I got some management topics.  I got some someone who gets raped topics. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Are you going to go work-related, Eric?  No, because Roland has already declared to everybody that was his territory.  Troy, are you going to work-related?  I don't want to break him off.  Yeah.  I mean, it's probably a smarter thing not to, especially if Roland is going hard in the paint.  Yeah.  You know, work-related.  I told Opie one of the jokes, and he went, ooh, ooh.  Okay.  So that's good.  Eric, we have to wrap up now?  Yeah, we got to go.  Okay. 
[04:20:00]  We have to go.  Troy, we'll talk about this tomorrow, because we got to Thursday.  If you want to come to the staff stand-up competition at the Hard Rock Cafe, just check the Facebook.  Do we get a prize?  Or at least they should throw us a pizza party.  Enough we get.  Throw us a pizza party.  A prize would kind of make you want it good.  You know what the prize is?  Throw us a pizza party.  Yeah, but we're not allowed to.  You know what the prize is?  Pizza party.  A good show.  Wait, hold on.  Enough.  Always looking for a reward.  But some people are just going to be like, okay, three minutes, start the clock.  Like, okay, like, if there was money or something involved, an incentive? 
[04:20:30]  I just got to know from Rob and Gary, we are going to have a barbecue and pizza party.  Here's the incentive.  You didn't get that, by the way.  An iPad 2.  He just makes it up.  The incentive is...  We get an iPad 2.  All right.  That's what Rob Cross just said.  Here's the incentive.  Go ahead, sir.  The incentive is just doing a good show.  Yeah, but...  I mean, I know that's not enough for Roland.  He needs a reward no matter what he does.  A reward will help you.  A reward is an incentive to try to crush.  We'll try to get into some of that tomorrow.  And maybe talk to Travis and Danny. 
[04:21:00]  Danny's not here today.  That's why we can talk to him.  Maybe talk to Travis and Danny about some of his...  Well, we'd be able to go a lot quicker if you weren't interrupting me, wouldn't we?  Thank you.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  We'll continue tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.  Ron and Fez interns, I guess, go find something to do.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah!  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[04:21:30]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
