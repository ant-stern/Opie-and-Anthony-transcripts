<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' typical vulgar and boastful banter, notable for Jim Norton's absence due to a Tonight Show appearance.  The main focus initially centered on a viral video showing a Range Rover driver being chased by motorcyclists on the West Side Highway. Opie and Anthony provided their characteristically racist and offensive commentary, speculating on the events and the actions of both parties. Callers Michael (from Jersey) and Al (from Brooklyn) offered additional context, identifying the event as the annual, unsanctioned "Hollywood Block Party." Opie also shared a related personal anecdote.  The government shutdown was the second major topic, with the hosts expressing their outrage towards Congress and President Obama using highly offensive and derogatory language.  They criticized the hypocrisy of Congress members receiving pay while government employees were furloughed, discussing potential dangers from reduced government services and criticizing Obamacare.  Fez's offense at a Chevrolet commercial's use of the word "crazy" sparked a debate about offensive language on the show, leading to tangential discussions about a Cheerios commercial and Opie's childhood. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the government shutdown.

The show continued with a discussion of the hosts' relationships with their grandmothers, transitioning to Ron and Fez's reaction to the same Chevrolet commercial.  Audio clips from Ron and Fez were played, featuring Fez, Ron Bennington, and "Shelby" (Pepper Hicks). The hosts engaged in a profanity-laced debate about offensive language, including terms like "crazy," "insane," and "retarded."  The conversation meandered through Opie's daughter's upcoming birthday/christening, past stunts (including Anthony's Hitler costume), and further controversial audio clips from Ron and Fez, highlighting Fez's inconsistent stances. The segment concluded with jokes about Fez's reaction to the commercial.

The next segment began with a listener, Mo, attempting an on-air marriage proposal, which was abruptly ended by the hosts. This led to a discussion of Mike Francesa's abruptness.  The conversation then shifted to a YouTube parody of Francesa hosting a radio show in 1776, featuring "Mike Zahn."  A call-in guest, portraying Lord Cornwallis, participated in a humorous, historically inaccurate discussion of the Revolutionary War.  The show then focused on Opie's kitten, Beavis, and the upcoming Jocktober segment.  Guest Nick DiPaolo joined the discussion of the government shutdown, offering cynical commentary on political issues and societal trends.  The conversation also included DiPaolo's stand-up comedy, a Van Halen tribute band, and personal anecdotes.  The segment concluded with planning for the Jocktober segment targeting a Canadian radio show.  Racial slurs, misogynistic remarks, and homophobic comments were used throughout.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to "Jocktober," focusing on a critical dissection of Hot 92.3's "The Fugitive" promotion in Fredericton, Canada.  Opie, Anthony, DiPaolo, and guest Dennis Falcone ridiculed the poorly executed stunt, playing audio clips and dissecting the station's Facebook page.  They also criticized the loud audio levels of another SiriusXM DJ, "J.J. Walker" (Spider Harrison).  The discussion touched upon the differences between stand-up comedy and radio.

The "fugitive" contest continued, with heavy criticism of the fugitive's lack of charisma. The conversation veered into discussions of David Norton, Nick DiPaolo (who received ribbing), Fred Travalina (with played audio clips), Rich Little, Dennis Falcone (who was briefly interviewed), and Steve Puma.  Crude humor and numerous tangents characterized the segment. The hosts discussed their past experiences at AAF, including defying management. The segment ended with discussion of DiPaolo's podcast and comedy shows.

The After Opie and Anthony Live segment, hosted by Sam Roberts, focused on listener reactions to the "fugitive" segment.  Sal's prediction of the hosts' Jocktober fatigue was noted. Callers, including a self-proclaimed "fugitive" (providing the clue "slobo") and "Lady Trucker," were featured. Roberts defended the segment despite criticism, highlighting the show's overall quality due to Opie and Anthony's tendency to say "crazy shit," citing Anthony's mention of potentially killing his ex-wife as an example.  The segment concluded with anticipation of the Ron and Fez show, summarizing the broadcast's content including the motorcycle gang segment, the government shutdown, and appearances by Mike Francesa and Nick DiPaolo.

[00:03:30]  Opie and Anthony Show  Opie and Anthony Show  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen, so appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  From satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show and Opie and Anthony Show and Opie and Anthony Show.  We're experts and we're experts and we're experts and we're experts and we're experts and we're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony?  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:04:00]  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an hour, I don't even like an hour opening.  I don't even like an hour opening.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ooh. 
[00:04:30]  Ah.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Did you, uh, oh, you turned us...  Out of habit, right?  I turned on a little Jim Norton's microphone.  Aw, well, Jimmy's, uh, not here today.  He'll be in tomorrow, I think.  I believe so, yes.  Some Tonight Show stuff.  Ooh, very cool.  The Tonight Show, starring Jay Leno.  Actually...  With Jim Norton.  51 years ago, it was Johnny Carson's show for the first time. 
[00:05:00]  Johnny.  There you go.  Wow, there's a little trivia for you.  Right off the bat.  Oh, boy.  We like to give you a little trivia in the morning,  so you've got something to take to work with you.  You know, you buy the water cooler.  Hey, did you know that 51 years ago today,  Johnny Carson debuted on The Tonight Show?  And then hopefully he gets smacked in the face  for being such a nerd.  Get fucking beat up in the coffee room.  Get beat up by a whole bunch of motorcyclists.  Yeah, or that.  Just for giving a little tidbit.  Yeah.  Or maybe bumping a bike. 
[00:05:30]  That's a sick fucking story, man.  But you know what?  I'm thinking the Asian driver.  There's a few things at play here with that story.  Here in New York, apparently on the West Side Highway,  nice big stretch of road.  Yes.  Up on the West Side of New York, New York City.  And this guy's in an SUV.  He's got his wife and his young child in the back seat.  Wasn't it a Range Rover?  It was in a Range Rover. 
[00:06:00]  We were just talking about Range Rovers.  We were just chatting about that yesterday.  Well, were we talking about Land Rovers?  And are they the same thing?  I still don't know.  Yes, I know.  It's very mysterious.  Thank you.  Very vague.  It's very Iraqi-an.  So he was in a Range Rover.  In a Range Rover.  There's videos everywhere.  Yeah, the video's been viral, as they say.  Sure.  And he's driving along on the West Side Highway,  and a bunch of these motorcyclists come up around him.  Now, let's get this straight.  There are bikers, which are mostly bikers 
[00:06:30]  type dudes on Harleys that are out for a ride.  And then there's these guys.  They're predominantly, in New York,  these gangs of black guys on crotch rockets,  on rice burners.  I saw them on Sunday.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw them flying down Broadway,  and everyone just stopped doing what they were doing.  Because in New York City, most people don't look around.  Right.  It has to be something special.  And on Sunday, it was something special.  And all of a sudden, you're like, what the fuck? 
[00:07:00]  It was hundreds of them just blowing lights.  They just took over Broadway.  You want to see crazier guys.  You won't see a crazier person than a black guy on a rice burner.  They drive insane.  And this happened on Sunday, right?  Yeah.  So I'm assuming it happened right after I saw them pass on Broadway.  They were probably heading toward the West Side Highway.  Yeah.  Off Broadway.  Yeah.  What a sight to see, though.  Huge.  It comes upon you like it's a swarm of bees.  That's what it sounds like, yeah.  It starts off with just one, and all of a sudden, 
[00:07:30]  they're all over.  And then, of course, it's a perfect storm,  because now you've got an Asian driver.  Asian driver.  But see, you're not really allowed to say Asians drive shitty.  No, you can't.  I mean, you can't do that on regular radio.  We could do it here on a satellite still.  And my personal observations is any time I'm driving through Queens on the expressway  and someone's fucking up by the numbers in a vehicle,  I pull up next to them, and lo and behold,  eight times out of ten, it's an Asian driver.  And these guys are all together. 
[00:08:00]  It's kind of like a mob.  Yeah.  It's a mob mentality.  I'm not saying in a way where they're going to do harm,  but in this case, they ended up doing harm.  And we're watching the video again.  Sorry.  This guy.  He's in the car with his wife and his very young child.  Right.  Yeah.  And then one of the guys on the motorcycles gets in front of him on the West Side Highway,  and this is all filmed with one of the motorcyclists' helmet cams.  Well, this is where the filming starts. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  That's why I have questions, but go ahead.  Apparently, the SUV, from what I'm hearing, and it isn't on the video,  earlier, the SUV had inadvertently cut off one of the motorcyclists.  Right.  And that might have driven the other motorcyclists that we see when the tape starts  to get in front of the SUV, and he jams on his brakes.  He turns around, looks back, and jams on his brakes,  at which point the SUV hits the rear tire of that motorcyclist.  Holy fuck.  They all stop, and now 20 to 30 of the motorcyclists gather around this guy's SUV with their bikes. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  And I guess start tormenting and taunting him.  Correct.  He's got his wife and young child in the car.  He then hits the gas, runs over some of the motorcycles,  and now he's down the West Side Highway, and the chase starts.  And when he ran over some of the motorcyclists, he broke one of the guy's legs.  Legs, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Now you got...  You think the motorcyclists at that point are going to go, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Let him go.  Let him go.  We made our point, and maybe we went too far. 
[00:09:30]  Poor Harry over here has a broken leg.  No, of course not.  Now you get what amounts to a mini mission on GTA 5 because this guy is now driving down the West Side Highway,  being chased by what amounts to 100 motorcycles down the West Side Highway,  and they are all gaining on him, and now they're surrounding him as he's driving.  Yes.  This continues down the highway. 
[00:10:00]  They really have no recourse, the motorcycles, at this point because he's in a Range Rover.  There's not much they can do.  Right.  At that point.  Well, why didn't he stay on the highway?  Exactly.  He makes a fatal mistake.  Well, not fatal, but an injurious mistake.  What, he thought he could get to his house or something?  Because he got off the West Side Highway, and that's when all hell broke loose.  He gets off the West Side Highway.  He gets stuck in traffic.  He's then surrounded again.  One of the motorcyclists get off of his bike, takes his helmet off, and bashes in his driver's side window.  That's where the video ends because apparently the guy knew better not to video 
[00:10:30]  as they dragged him out of the window and punched him a bit.  Well, they got that video.  Oh, they do?  I'm sure.  I haven't seen that one.  I was surprised they...  I'm sure they do.  I was surprised they uploaded this video.  Yeah, they kind of, you know...  Because it's one guy, he knows he has the video, and he goes,  Oh, I've got to put this on YouTube.  Even though it's incriminating, sometimes it's just too cool not to put up,  hence your Chrysler building video.  Uh-huh.  Ooh, I get to tweet that today now.  Every time one of my videos is mentioned, I have to tweet it because people are like, 
[00:11:00]  What Chrysler building video?  Right.  Yeah, but the guy couldn't help himself.  He put it on YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  But you've got to think that he's got video of the Asian guy getting the shit beat out of him.  Getting beat up a little bit.  Man, the helmet goes right through the window.  Oh, yeah.  You drag him out, supposedly, and then they beat him right in front of his family.  They worked him over a bit.  This is...  It's GTA, though.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  But it really does make no sense that he got off the highway. 
[00:11:30]  Why get off the highway, you dummy?  Just drive as fast as you can down the West Side Highway.  As fast as you can.  And do a little swervy.  Wait for a cop.  A little swervy to the left.  A little swervy to the right.  That'll keep them off you a little bit.  It goes right to 95 in 15 minutes.  You're in the suburbs.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You could take a highway all the way up to Maine.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to go through one toll booth.  He was a dummy for getting off the road.  Right.  I mean, if anything taught us in GTA 5, you don't get off the highways like that when 
[00:12:00]  maybe you're being chased by the cops.  Never.  You got three stars on you.  You got to fucking goose it and try to lose them.  I would have made it to the toll booth near that bridge there near the Henry Hudson.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I forgot the name of the day.  Oh, good.  So the toll takers could go, your registration's expired.  Oh, no.  As they beat you.  I'd rip right through the gate because then now you're getting the stars like GTA.  You need stars at that point.  You need a couple stars.  You need the helicopters.  And now, you know, if you do a couple other maneuvers, then you get the helicopters.  And then, you know what? 
[00:12:30]  The motorcycle guys aren't going to beat the shit out of you.  Right.  There's a speed trap right by where he got off the highway where there's always cops there.  Well.  Always.  That's why I questioned, you know.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  I got to be careful.  You know.  You've got to.  Those people, those people sometimes, sometimes, sometimes might not be thinking clearly when  they're on a, on a roadway.  Yeah.  They think clearly in other, other arenas like, you know, I don't know, like, thank you. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  I was going to say the math class.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Great work ethic.  Sciences.  Science.  The sciences.  Technologies.  Technologies.  But something happens when they get on a road is all I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  It's been my experience over the years.  My experience.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  All decision making goes south.  A little bit.  Yeah.  So, uh, that's, that's a big story now.  They're, they're, and, and, and there's people in both camps, I guess, uh, avid motorcyclists. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, which video were you, uh, referring to, by the way?  Because I have two.  Oh, actually, I like the one that shows the complete climb.  Oh, okay.  Because that's a little more, you know.  But should I tweet the other one just as a, okay.  You know what?  As a, as an aside.  Okay.  Back to this.  Sorry.  Let's say you had tweeted and uploaded a video about, or you uploaded a video on YouTube  about, uh, you using a slingshot ricochets off and hits you in the head.  Right.  Then you'd also put up the one that shows it's fake.  Okay.  And by the way, everyone was not buying the Sal thing. 
[00:14:00]  Sal's dumb story.  They're all convinced that Sal got caught.  Pants on fire.  And was trying to, you know, save face.  Yeah.  But anyway.  Uh, did we put this video up on our Facebook page?  Everyone has seen it, I guess.  It's all over the news.  Yeah.  There is a level of dumb dumb associated with this radio show.  And we got to like cater to those people.  So go to our Facebook page.  In a few minutes, we'll have that video linked for you.  If you're going to run over.  The one we're talking about, the motorcycle thing, by the way.  Yeah.  If you're going to run over an entire motorcycle gang. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And you're in a car.  Uh-huh.  You keep driving as fast as you can.  Drive to Connecticut.  Past Connecticut.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Dude, I would.  Just keep going.  And then just.  And then just make a left somewhere and head to, start heading to L.A.  A cabin in New Hampshire.  Just make a left.  Yes.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  You've got a wide open road for many states.  Right.  Find some snow cover abandoned car to hide in for a while.  No one I would stop when I ran out of gas.  Right.  I don't know why.  You're right.  This guy got off the highway and he's stuck at a red light. 
[00:15:00]  Terrible move.  In the city.  There's no fucking way.  You're not going to get off and be.  Yeah.  It's not like GTA.  Unless you want to drive on the sidewalks and run people over.  Right.  In GTA, that traffic wouldn't have mattered.  You just go up the sidewalk.  You run a few people over and make the turn.  And then you find one of those fucking car spray places and you lose them.  Of course.  We all know that.  My strategy would be to crash into things until my car was on fire and jump out and hope  it blows up around the people chasing them. 
[00:15:30]  Yes.  That's a good strategy.  I'm going to strongly suggest that the driver of the Range Rover started the whole thing.  Oof.  He cut some guy off.  He did a stupid move.  And I'm not even thinking on purpose.  But I don't think he hurt anyone at that point.  You start panicking when you're on a road and there's a million motorcycles all around you.  You just got to fucking drive.  And they get a little cocky because they're all together as one unit.  These gangs of roving motorcycle guys like this on the Crotch Rockets, they love pulling 
[00:16:00]  little stunts.  They love gang up.  They like the intimidation factor on the road.  And they fuck around.  They stop traffic on highways.  They do some fucking burnouts and shit.  Make a lot of smoke.  How about the wheelie down the highway?  Oh, that's crazy.  You've seen that, right?  Oh, yeah.  I have an anxiety attack when that shit happens.  I'm like, why would you do that?  Crazy.  Standing up on their bikes.  Standing up on like the rear pegs with the bike straight up in the air doing fucking 80 
[00:16:30]  down the expressway.  I like the free show, but man, I get a little stressed out.  Ooh.  I just like watching them on ridiculousness because it never ends well.  No.  I like that show.  It's pretty good.  He figured out the clip show.  It's people hurting themselves.  Somebody needed to figure out the clip show, and Rob did.  I don't like how wigorous he is.  Well.  And some of his guests are, like, every time I turn it on, why is that street bike Tommy  guy on?  He's too old and fat to be an extreme guy.  I don't know. 
[00:17:00]  I just, you know, Rob has ignored that we've even talked to him.  Yeah, I know.  We want him on our show.  This show's perfect for him.  Maybe he doesn't need us, but.  I do like watching people hurt his show.  He doesn't even acknowledge that we're trying to get him on the show ever.  I like how it's become sheer comedy that.  Now, but most of the times, I guess the people aren't dying.  Most.  But I bet they're pretty fucked up.  And it's like a big, goofy joke that you laugh at that somebody's leg probably popped  through their knee, hyperextended, and changed their life.  Yeah, there's usually no confirmation that they're not paralyzed from the neck down. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  Ryan's got some more info on this thing, the motorcycle thing.  Go ahead, Ryan in the Bronx.  What's up, dudes?  They punctured his tire the second time they stopped him.  So I think that was an issue, man, that he was going flat, so he couldn't keep going.  What do you mean the second time?  Meaning when he was at the light?  No, no.  They surrounded him.  And then when he ran over the dude the second time.  They got him over here again.  Oh, they stopped him twice? 
[00:18:00]  They stopped him twice, and then he took off again, and then he got stuck in traffic.  But when they stopped him here, you're saying right there, that they punctured his tire?  Oh, he hung up for whatever reason.  Oh, well, I'd drive on the flat.  Who gives a shit?  Well, we all know he could drive on the flat.  Drive on that flat.  GTA again.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You'll weave a little back and forth, but you could keep it steady.  And your car's going to smoke a little bit.  It'll smoke a little.  But you still got some time.  Yeah, don't problem.  Get a few things done before it really goes on fire and explodes.  That moving vehicle is your only shelter at that point. 
[00:18:30]  It has to be moving, and him getting off was terrible.  I would have grabbed my little kid.  Yeah?  Pushed one of those fuckers off their bikes.  Yeah?  Leave the wife behind.  Grab the bike.  I would assume they wouldn't hurt her.  Is that part of the mission?  You got to save the kid?  And I would just jump on one of these fucking bikes.  Hey, what are you doing?  And then I would find the nearest ramp.  Yeah.  And jump over some shit.  Okay, look at this.  Get a fucking stunt bonus in the mix.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully you pass a plank of wood that's diagonally perched. 
[00:19:00]  Just a convenient ramp that's set up.  Maybe, yeah, a construction site with a two by six over a barrel.  It's so weird how that's, it just happens to be there for you.  It's just there.  It's nice.  A lot of fun.  They stop him in traffic on the highway the second time.  Yeah.  After he's already being chased by the biker gang, because he just ran over a biker gang.  They opened his car door.  He didn't have his doors locked.  What?  Look.  Yeah, but it wasn't going to matter.  They smashed right through the window.  This was before they smashed the window. 
[00:19:30]  Why the fuck would you not lock your door?  Because he was trying to save the side panel.  That's expensive to replace.  Oh, that's true.  The windows are one thing, but you don't want to replace a side panel.  But look where they stop him here and open his door.  They just walk up, and they pull the door open.  Well, he knows he's fucked at that point.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to sit.  Push the thing down.  He figures when his injuries heal, he'll at least have a halfway decent car still.  Look, he's open the door.  What are you doing?  He's not that smart.  Let's say hi to Michael, who might know this group of bikers.  Michael in Jersey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy. 
[00:20:00]  So, yeah, every year they've been doing this for at least four or five years, usually after Labor Day.  Yeah.  Everybody comes from as far as they can, get on their stunt bikes.  And when you have New York City riders, you get the quads involved, the ATVs involved.  They take over the roads.  They shut them down.  So, what I hear from some of the people involved in the incident itself was there was a little clipping between the bike and one of the motorcyclists.  But the side mirror would clip one of the bikers. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so he wouldn't slow down, and they're trying to get him to slow down, and he just decided, you know, he was going to weave his way through the back.  That's probably how he ended up clipping the bike in the first place.  Now, let me just say, they're both wrong.  Both of these guys are wrong at different points in time, and both of them are right at different points in time.  These riders would not reduce the police themselves, and they don't want any more negative stuff.  You have a few bad apples, but this guy plows.  A few bad apples. 
[00:21:00]  There was 100 guys chasing them.  The entire motorcycle group was chasing them.  None of them have license plates.  If you and all your guys are riding down the street, somebody gets in an accident, right?  You're going to pull over, too.  Now, I agree.  If these guys hit his window, which we couldn't see on the video, hell yeah, I'm plowing out of there for my life.  Hell yeah.  Well, the problem is we all are watching the video because one of the biker guys decided to upload it to YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  That could have saved the reputation of the bikers if there was no real evidence uploaded to YouTube. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no, for sure.  I mean, usually this information is passed around anonymously.  That's why the video came out of New Zealand from a guy named Jiksadar.  It's his alias, his online alias.  You know these guys.  I'm assuming, you know, it's an unfortunate situation.  There's a mob mentality, okay?  And what happens is when you have these big rides, people should either yield or, you know, I'm not endorsing the people who ride around the roads crazy. 
[00:22:00]  You know, they do that.  I think we have this, even though we don't have the other part of the video.  I think the Asian driver panicked.  I think the guy panicked.  He lost his mind panicked.  And then it escalated from there, obviously, because now in his panic, he clipped one of the, you know, motorcyclers, and then all hell broke loose.  We get it.  We get what happened here.  And plow, you know, not plow through, but weed his way through the pack to try and get ahead. 
[00:22:30]  And, you know, there's so many bikes.  No, that guy, no, no, look, look.  The guy that stopped in front of him was the instigator in this.  If he inadvertently cut off a motorcyclist earlier before the video started, and then that made one of the motorcyclists get in front of him and jam on the brakes until he got hit, it's the biker's fault.  Right.  And then when you surround somebody like that with 20 or 30 motorcycles, and they're taunting you, and you have your wife and kid in the car, it's fair game to run over anyone in front of you. 
[00:23:00]  You're taking off because at that point you're convinced you might die.  Right.  You're not going to sit around to see that maybe they're just going to, you know, crush your skull in.  You're going to be fucking, you know, Reginald Denny.  Reginald Denny, you have a Glock 23 in the car with two extra clips.  He didn't have a Glock. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  You can't get one in New York unless you're as lucky as you are.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Michael.  They're both as tall as all I'm saying.  Well, we kind of see it that way ourselves here.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, no, so I was just saying that if you had information on...  Well, we got a whole bunch of, you know, biker guys together on a highway.  They get a little cocky, too.  They know they're in charge of that particular road.  They don't just do it on the highway.  Like, they'll go down and...  Oh, this guy just keeps talking. 
[00:24:00]  He just keeps talking.  Thank you, sir.  Let me put you on the back.  God damn.  Opie, Anthony, and Michael.  Thank you, Michael and Jersey, for the insight.  They go down 7th Avenue, and they take the whole thing over.  Like, for whatever, 15 minutes, everybody ignores the red lights.  Nobody's driving on it.  It's like a parade.  I saw them going down the service road of the Belt Parkway on Sunday.  It must have been two different groups because this happened at the same time that this happened on the West.  Uh-huh.  But there was a hundred of them, and they're all doing wheelies, and they're going in and out of traffic. 
[00:24:30]  I think it's crazy.  It's the same gang.  It is the same group of people.  Yeah, because that's all they're doing.  They're not stopping.  They're just, like, kind of showing their-  No, they're going straight through everything.  Yeah, they're showing off.  I saw-  You saw them down there.  I saw them on the Upper West Side down Broadway.  They were flying down the road, and everyone just stopped in amazement, like, wow, this is pretty fucking cool.  Yeah, it's fun to watch because when you don't know what's going on, you think that it's some kind of parade that you weren't aware was happening.  You think the streets closed legitimately.  Yeah, a parade.  And there's a parade going through. 
[00:25:00]  And the whole goal, this guy has it, although I think someone else also said this on the show already.  But Al in Brooklyn, go ahead.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Who do you say, Al?  Okay, Twinkie.  Listen, this guy, you're saying they do this every year.  If you look it up on YouTube, it's called Hollywood Block Party.  Hollywood Block Party.  And they pretty much just terrorize Manhattan.  Not terrorize, but they kind of like get-  Take it over. 
[00:25:30]  They take it over.  They do their thing.  You can't call them they're savages, dude.  That's no other way to put it.  I'm a biker.  I'm what you call one of them Harley dudes, you know?  Yeah.  And we do a lot of runs.  You get police escorts.  You get permits.  This is unsanctioned.  This is just out of control.  Half these guys don't have a license.  They got illegal dirt bikes on the street.  Yeah.  And it makes it look bad for everyone.  Well, I don't think this will be happening next year.  It happens every year. 
[00:26:00]  Well, I don't think it's going to happen next year because I think the city is going to have  a problem with what they're seeing today.  Not with a new mayor in.  If de Blasio's in, he'll be like, no, you have to let them do whatever they want.  They're black people.  My son has a giant afro.  I'm sorry, guys.  They have incidences every year.  If you look it up on YouTube, you'll find it.  They do it all the time.  All right.  Yeah, we're looking at the videos.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  All right.  So there you go.  That's a big video today. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, the big story here in New York.  That's a big national story.  I was in a situation once coming home from Sam Roberts' house.  Was it a difficult situation?  I think I talked about it on the air, but I was on one of those highways between where  he lives and I live.  They're all, I don't know.  Is it the Henry Hudson?  Is it the Sawmill?  I don't know.  Is it fucking 95?  Is it the Cross County?  I don't know.  If it's between where you and Sam live, it must be luxurious.  It certainly was.  Because that's two areas that are just the best. 
[00:27:00]  It was still Best Chester.  Yeah.  Best Chester.  And it was me, my wife, and my young son at the time.  Uh-oh.  That sounds like the guy on the Range Rover.  Well, that's why it brings back this memory today.  And we're just minding our own fucking business.  There's not many cars on the road because it's like 11, 1130 at night.  All of a sudden, a mob of cars comes upon us.  Uh-oh.  And they kind of pass us aggressively, and they're all laughing and stuff.  They'll all laugh at you.  And they all get past our car and decide on this highway to jam on their brakes and completely 
[00:27:30]  stop the highway.  Yeah.  And I look over to my left, and people are just laughing.  They think it's hilarious.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I got a kid in a baby seat in the back, my wife.  Oh, man.  And all of a sudden, I stop as well.  And I'm just thinking, are they going to just pull us out of the fucking car?  What are they doing?  And then it turns out there's two guys in the front.  I guess they were the leaders.  I still don't know what this is, and I would like to know.  And all of a sudden, the two cars take off. 
[00:28:00]  They're having some kind of fucking drag race.  And they take off, and then everyone starts laughing, and they all just take off, all  instantly just take off as fast as they can.  So I decide, okay, that's that.  It happened three or four more times.  Yeah.  And then finally, I just said, we're not moving for a few minutes here.  Let them get the fuck down the road.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  What is that?  I don't know.  I guess they were racing.  They wait until all the traffic gets ahead of them long enough where they get empty road  in front of them.  Wide open road, right?  And then they take off.  But then you got all the other cars that are just watching the drag race. 
[00:28:30]  I'm sure they're just fucking having a pisser.  And this is a thing?  Yeah.  They like to flex their power, too.  Oh, yeah.  They like the idea of being able to shut down the highway.  Shut down roads, yeah.  You know.  You've heard of this as a thing?  Oh, yeah.  When you don't have a power base in real life, you have to, you know, make it where you can.  They thought it was hilarious.  But when they jammed on the brakes, it was, you know, it was kind of frightening.  Oh, yeah.  It was kind of frightening.  And then they take off and do a race.  For only, the race was only, I don't even know if it was, maybe a quarter mile. 
[00:29:00]  And then they stopped again.  Yeah.  That would be a race.  And I'm just like, fuck, where's the first exit off this goddamn thing?  That's frightening.  Everyone knows.  It's called, they do, it's street racing.  All right.  That was when, you know, when somebody comes up.  Well, we've seen on the Long Island Expressway, that's, the Long Island Expressway is its own animal where you got the two guys just zipping in and out of fucking traffic.  They're racing the whole time.  But I'm talking, there's so many cars on the road, they're able to shut down the highway to make it just clear sailing. 
[00:29:30]  Yep.  So, this was a little different than what I've seen in the past.  That's when you, when someone's taking a motorcycle helmet and smashing your window.  Yeah.  And you have your wife and young kid in the car.  That's when you shove a gun right in their face.  That's when you pull a gun out and you point it at them and go, get the fuck away from my vehicle or I will kill you.  And then you watch him back off.  And if he doesn't, then you got to shoot him. 
[00:30:00]  And it's completely justified.  At that point, if you're, if this guy's beating on your window and you have a fear for your life that you're going to be dragged out and your wife and kid.  Right.  Absolutely justifiable.  Right.  And that'll fucking back them off real quick.  If they see their buddy hit the pavement and start fucking pumping the old vital vino out of his chest.  Bastards.  Well.  Yeah, look at that.  Watching videos of them just doing wheelies up the street.  Yeah, it's just.  Fuck them.  Just madness, so. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  We got that going on.  And we also got the government.  I guess they shut down.  Ah!  Panic!  What happened to the countdown clock?  Wait till these motorcyclers realize there is no government.  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be like Mad Max.  Yeah.  The anarchy has begun.  True.  The road warrior right there.  Same thing.  We got a very interesting situation going on in Washington because now it's like two cars going right at each other.  Who's going to fucking move first?  I'll talk to this Obama.  He seems like a reasonable man. 
[00:31:00]  They're all a bunch of twats.  Period.  Yeah.  You pick a side.  I choose not to.  Fuck them all.  And then, like you told me this morning, Congress still gets paid through this whole thing.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Congress getting paid through this.  As other people, like real hardworking Americans, they have easy fucking career jobs.  It's cushy as all hell.  Why should they be inconvenienced?  But it's the, you know, it's the grunt workers that don't have a job today while these fucking assholes shut down the government knowing that they will still get their fucking pay, their pay. 
[00:31:30]  There are a lot of people, regularly middle class Joes, that are employed by the government.  And they are not going to go to work and they're not going to get paid.  Right.  Meanwhile, though, the people that you want to be inconvenienced by this and get it resolved quickly, you know, the government, Congress, they still get paid. 
[00:32:00]  They should not get paid.  The government shuts down.  They don't get paid until they figure it out.  It only figured that's the most sensible thing.  But who voted for that?  They did.  They're the people that vote for all this shit.  But don't they vote as, you know, they.  They're supposed to represent what our wishes are.  Right.  See, so if we decided.  And why would the people.  So we decided that we decided if the government shuts down. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  You guys absolutely need to still be paid.  So we represent you guys.  So you want us to still get paid.  Right.  When the government shuts down.  Yes.  Yes.  You're representing us.  That's what we want.  No, we don't want that.  So how did that pass?  It's bullshit.  We no longer are represented by these motherfuckers.  They they rule over us.  This government rules us.  We are at their beck and call when it was supposed to be them working for us. 
[00:33:00]  It that that died a long time ago.  We are under some type of dictatorship.  And I don't want to sound like paranoid.  Alex Jones.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're under a dictatorship at this point.  Of course.  Obviously, it's a false flag operation.  Of course we are.  But it started way before Obama.  It did.  It's a slow, very slow thing.  Of course we are.  Because if it happened overnight, the people would have revolted.  There would have been some kind of revolution.  But the fact that it happened so slowly, we just all of a sudden look back and go, how did this happen? 
[00:33:30]  No person left behind.  Yeah.  That's a dictatorship.  Period.  Dictator.  That's not that's not the that's not the thinking of a capitalistic society.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, in a capitalistic society, some people will be left behind.  That's what makes America great.  If everyone is fucking equal doing the exact same shit, that's that's that leans more toward communism.  What happens to some of the baby turtles?  So, well, at this point, we're all we're trying to save every goddamn baby, every baby turtle. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  I said it years ago.  Not all the baby turtles are going to make it to the ocean.  But you know what?  Them birds need to eat, too.  Well, you know what?  Them birds will swoop in down.  This country decided we got to save every fucking baby.  Every baby turtle.  Period.  Needs to be saved.  Even the dumb ones that flip over on their back.  Right.  The one legged ones.  The ones that aren't, you know, genetically superior.  Oh, but this is going to be this is going to be very interesting because you're looking 
[00:34:30]  at Obama and Obamacare, which, by the way, I don't I don't like either.  I think we should have health care for the fucking people of if it makes sense.  But this in this form, it sucks.  It sucks so bad.  As a matter of fact, again, Congress is exempt from Obamacare.  It's part of the actual bill is that Congress doesn't have to adhere to the Obamacare Affordable  Health Act.  Isn't that wonderful?  Why?  Isn't that wonderful? 
[00:35:00]  Wouldn't you think if it's so good for the people?  So they don't even they don't even live like the people.  No.  They get to keep their jobs under horrible circumstances like the government shutting  down.  And they don't have to do the Obamacare if they know if they choose not to.  No.  How does that make sense?  This is a very, very expensive bill.  I agree.  Expensive.  That's where we're in agreement.  But here's the problem.  This is Obama's legacy.  We're talking about his baby.  He ain't fucking budging because when it's all said and done and where we move on to other 
[00:35:30]  presidents, they're going to look back at Obama and this is his fucking legacy right  here, right the fuck here.  We're looking at his legacy.  Yeah.  So he doesn't want to fuck it up.  No.  He sees he's got those guys by the ball, sort of.  So he's not going to fucking budge.  No.  Why would he?  Why would he?  Why would he?  Yeah.  Whoever blinks first is going to be.  Well, I mean, their approval rating.  Congress's approval rating.  Was it really down to 10 percent?  It's in the 10 percent. 
[00:36:00]  No one has confidence in this.  The way the government is 10 percent.  The family members of Congress probably is.  Who's the idiot that, no, I think they're doing a terrific job.  Those are those hardcore partisan people that just no matter what the party does, they agree  with it and love it.  That's it.  When the fact of the matter is both sides in this instance are at an impasse because they  they cannot compromise with each other.  Right.  Obama and the Democrats do not want to do anything with the affordable health care bill. 
[00:36:30]  And the Republicans don't want to compromise or budge.  And they're they're not going to sign a budget because they don't like Obamacare.  You got to work this out.  We got to work this out.  Meanwhile, things, agencies, again, that we need, like the FBI, are going to be shorthanded.  Boy, I'll tell you, if you're a terrorist out there and you want to fuck around with the  United States, now's the time to do it.  Have fun. 
[00:37:00]  There's no resources in place to really fight on terrorism as much as we have to.  And if we're if we're getting limited government services, we don't have to pay our taxes, right?  No, by the way, I've heard the agencies that will be operating the Internal Revenue Service  will be collecting all taxes.  Of course.  Your mail will get through air traffic controllers.  Your state police or your federal police will still be on the job.  Of course. 
[00:37:30]  But a lot of other a lot of your civilian government employees are going to be taking a hike and  your national parks.  Don't look for your little trip to the Statue of Liberty today because the boat ain't leaving.  It ain't leaving.  It ain't leaving.  You ain't getting over there.  So today would be the day to go over there.  Who would stop you?  No crowds.  But who would stop you?  Who would stop you?  If you're Al Qaeda and you got a fucking explosive belt on, you want to climb in there and blow  her head up?  Do they have security at the Statue of Liberty today? 
[00:38:00]  I bet they can't be paid.  I bet it's fucking empty.  Ellis Island.  Yeah.  I want to go to Ellis Island today.  How do we get this done?  Swim.  Speck and Z-Tack.  No, I'm being completely honest here.  Sam.  Yes.  You just got goofy for the radio show.  I actually want to go to Ellis Island today.  That's boobie.  Hans, boobie.  Right.  You want to go to Ellis Island today?  Yeah.  If you get a jet ski, you can go over there.  A jet ski.  Yeah?  Yes.  That's a Polish jet. 
[00:38:30]  Everyone's talking about how-  Fucking hilarious.  Wow.  I work for the federal government, but I'm on my way to work, but not getting paid.  That's got to suck.  Oh, well, that's good.  By the way, Congress is.  No rush there.  Health care.  Wow.  Yeah.  People are just-  Wow.  People have lost confidence in their government, right?  In their politicians. 
[00:39:00]  By the way, Affordable Health Care Act implemented today.  A lot of the important things today.  This means that if you are in that demographic, like 18, 34, you are required by law to get insurance.  Now, you might remember as a youngster, you just kind of rolled the dice.  Odds were.  You got to roll the dice.  Odds were you probably weren't going to have a catastrophic illness at that age.  You can't afford anything anyway. 
[00:39:30]  But to force people, that's unbelievable too.  It is forcing.  Because I remember when I was in that age group, and from 18 to 34, I barely made any money.  Right.  And I couldn't, I didn't want an extra bill for health insurance.  And you get to stay on mommy and daddy's until what?  I think it's 20, what is it now?  20, I think 20.  25?  24, 24.  28, 26, 25, 24.  I'm getting all kinds of numbers.  It's 26. 
[00:40:00]  Mostly 26 coming in.  When we were growing up, same thing?  No.  When we were growing up, what was it?  I think it was fucking like 21.  And it depended on.  So from 21 to, no, I have a reason I'm asking.  So from 21 to, when did we get health insurance through our jobs?  We didn't get it in Boston.  I'm trying to think if we had health insurance in Boston.  I think we did.  I think we did.  Through Zappus Communications.  So safe to say, easily 10 years without health insurance. 
[00:40:30]  Oh my God.  I had it in my tin knocking job, too.  When I was in air conditioning and heating, I had health insurance.  Oh, so you always had health insurance.  I always had it.  Oh no, I went at least 10 years without it.  At least.  That's a quarter of my life, Sam Roberts.  But as a youngster, you're just kind of, eh.  So now if you don't have it, you will be fined.  And I guess for the first year, it's only like 95 bucks.  Right.  So obviously, if you're a youngster, you're going to opt for the $95 fine instead of getting the health insurance. 
[00:41:00]  So that's a tax, by the way.  Yeah, they just figured out another revenue stream.  They figured out a way to tax all the young people in America $95.  They're going to make a shitload of money off people not getting the insurance.  Someone's got to pay for it.  But it won't raise your taxes one dime.  Nice.  Oh, not your income taxes or anything.  But it's a new tax, believe me.  And even the Supreme Court dubbed the Obamacare funding a tax. 
[00:41:30]  So don't try to say that.  It isn't.  It's just ridiculous.  And now also employers are cutting people because full-time employees, now your employer has to insure them.  I don't know how that happened.  I don't know how, because someone gives you a job, they are now entitled to insure you.  Why?  I mean, it's nice if they can.  That was always a perk of getting a good job.  It was called a perk. 
[00:42:00]  You'd get a job and be like, what are the benefits?  Well, we have a health care program.  You're like, oh, nice.  First time I heard that, I'm like, what?  I know.  It's great.  How cool is this?  Now the government is telling every employer that they now are legally obligated to insure their employees.  Again, if they don't, they must pay a fine.  If the fine's cheaper than insuring, they're going to pay the fine, which, again, another tax that goes to the government.  Also, you take your full-time employees, you cut those shifts in half, you make everybody part-time, now you're not obligated to insure them, which gives the people less money. 
[00:42:30]  I don't see this working very well.  I mean, it's very nice and noble to want everybody to have affordable health care, but the truth of the matter is it's very difficult to do in a capitalistic society.  We're not socialists.  It's not socialized medicine.  I think a lot of people are under the misconception that this is free health care.  I think a lot of people think that they can now, like Canada or England, go in and have themselves taken care of. 
[00:43:00]  No, this is called the affordable health care.  I don't know how it's affordable.  Nothing, the price of medicine and equipment and everything, that's not changing.  Right.  So how it became affordable, I don't know.  I guess through taxes.  You're just getting a lot more people into the system.  Right.  We got to buy stock in the drug companies, man.  You think the drug companies are going to do it?  We should have done it before today, huh?  Yeah.  Damn it.  Yeah.  It's all ridiculous.  And now that the government's shut down, they're going to take their time a little bit. 
[00:43:30]  And they're going to subsidize people that can't afford it.  There's a government subsidy is going in place.  So if you qualify, they will pay for your health care because they deem that you have a right to health care and the government will subsidize it.  I have a right to, again, gun ownership.  I would like the government to subsidize some guns for me.  I want some very nice, expensive guns.  Yeah.  It's my right as per the Second Amendment. 
[00:44:00]  So I want the government subsidizing that.  Can they do that, please?  No.  Thank you.  Boner, Boehner, whatever, did this last night.  I talked to the president earlier tonight.  That sounds like a comedy.  I'm not going to negotiate.  A comedian's starting.  I'm not going to negotiate.  I'm not going to do this.  Well, I would say to the president, this is not about me.  And it's not about Republicans here in Congress.  It's about fairness for the American people.  Oh, that's what it's about. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  Oh, I see.  All right.  That's logical.  So Obama's the asshole.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Until you listen to Obama.  Right.  And then Boehner's the asshole.  And the Republicans are the asshole.  Now Harry Reid's the asshole.  Fuck.  Oh, wait a minute.  I can't make my own decision.  Here's the best part.  They're not even talking to each other.  Like that fucking Carney, by the way.  If there's any kind of revolution, Carney should be the first one to be in the stocks  in the middle of the town square having fucking vegetables thrown at his face. 
[00:45:00]  This motherfucker is supposed to be the spokesperson for the president and the White House.  He comes out in front of the media and does nothing but deflect every fucking question that's  asked of him.  And believe me, I know that's every single press secretary.  It's every single one of them.  I understand this.  It happened under Bush.  I get it.  But when it's now and this guy's in, I can only, you know, judge him. 
[00:45:30]  He's infuriating to watch when they ask him a simple question and he just will not answer  it.  That's not what the American people asked for.  We want an accountability as to what the White House is doing on a daily basis.  And this fuck comes out with his mysterious Iraq vagaries.  Ah, he must be wonderful with the text message.  Oh, boy.  Hey, you hear what happened at the White House?  What?  What?  Oh, well, I'm going to tell you in about another 10 text messages. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Where are you?  He is terrible.  It's got to be terrible.  It's so frustrating to work in Washington where nothing gets done on a regular basis.  He was being asked yesterday, why hasn't the president gone to the Hill and discussed  this?  That's a good question.  And done that?  He wouldn't answer it.  Well, I and he said something like, well, I haven't seen anything on the president's  schedule.  That tells me he's not going. 
[00:46:30]  It's that isn't what was asked of you.  It's why hasn't he gone to the Hill to discuss this?  Sit down like the leader and and fucking make this work.  The whole situation is crazy.  Very difficult situation.  What?  I don't know if we.  The whole situation is absolutely fucking crazy down there in Washington.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, watch that.  Pure lunacy.  Oh, watch that.  I don't know if we language the C word. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, I don't think we on this channel.  I don't think we use that word.  Don't use the C.  They're absolutely mentally ill down there.  Oh, no, Washington.  Now.  Now you are talking about a crazy situation.  Just this.  Just be no end in sight.  What's next?  Just dropping and bombs like a madman.  What are you doing?  It's an XL channel doesn't mean you have to disregard everybody's feelings.  I feel like there's a whole me, me, me mentality going on down there in Washington.  Oh, Jesus.  With this whole government shutdown thing.  Oh, no.  You don't see it as a crazy situation. 
[00:47:30]  I don't use that word.  I don't use that word either.  This sensitivity.  What?  What are you talking about?  Anti-bullying.  What?  What's happening?  Did I miss something?  Why not just say fucking, you know, use the R word or the N word.  Right.  It's called the C word.  The C word?  Yeah.  No, we got the C word.  Ah, that's been replaced.  The C word's been replaced.  Yes.  Yes, we've totally eliminated that C word because it's much too offensive.  Oh.  You don't even say the C word for the C word anymore? 
[00:48:00]  Or you just know you just, it's just a bad word?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no place for that.  You just say this situation is out of the ordinary.  Out of the ordinary?  No, it's absolutely fucking crazy.  Don't.  Oh, no.  Don't.  We have a government that has shut down.  That's fucking nuts.  Come on.  Can you say nuts?  No.  Absolutely not.  It implies C.  Crazy.  Oh, but I don't use that word.  I don't either.  I don't either. 
[00:48:30]  I don't use that word.  I don't even sing it like.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  That makes me.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Going out to the rails on the.  Hmm.  Train.  See, that's what I do.  Yeah, me too.  What?  You don't say crazy anymore?  Why?  What happened?  Jesus.  What happened?  It offends certain.  What?  Well.  Peoples and groups.  There's a group.  Well, is it really a group?  I've heard one representative.  Oh, okay. 
[00:49:00]  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  I was reading some tweets.  I must say, I think I had a brilliant setup there.  Oh, man.  I have to tear down the wall today.  You did, but I got to say also, Sam Roberts picked right up on it.  It's a brilliant setup.  I didn't.  I guess I'm insensitive.  What happened?  Someone has a problem with the word crazy, huh?  Yeah.  Yep.  I hear that was a big issue yesterday on the run of fish.  And that's where the issue did pop up.  I was reading some tweets. 
[00:49:30]  Is this our Jocktober?  Look.  Is this the first Jocktober?  It's going to feature.  What?  Are we featuring Fez on Jocktober?  This really.  Oh, my God.  This fits.  Is all I'm saying.  Really?  Like a glove.  Is it kind of like, guys?  A little bit.  Oh, no.  A little bit.  Is this the kickoff for Jocktober?  It's going to be featuring Fez?  He was.  People were calling up the show yesterday.  Wow.  Wondering why Fez decided he had to be the whole. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, boy.  What happened yesterday?  Well, Fez brought to the show's attention that there's a commercial for Chevrolet.  Right.  That uses the word crazy irresponsibly.  And he has a problem with the word crazy.  He was deeply offended by it.  The commercial.  What?  Do you want to.  Maybe.  Look.  Maybe we should play the commercial.  I don't know if you want to take a break or you want to play the commercial.  I think we got to take a break.  We got to take a break.  And then we should kick off Jocktober. 
[00:50:30]  With Fez?  Now, here's the thing.  Oh, no.  You guys may see the commercial.  Or is this bonus Jocktober?  Oh, man.  I'm going to tell you something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a full Jocktober prepared outside of the Fez situation.  Bonus Jocktober.  That's right.  Is Fez doing a bit?  No.  Oh, jeez.  This is not a bit.  He's actually mad at the word crazy.  Like, can you say mad?  Mad.  Mad in England, it means crazy.  Right.  Yes, I don't know if you want to.  He's positively mad. 
[00:51:00]  Like, Ron voiced being, like, scared yesterday.  Wow.  Really?  Like, Ron was like, this is freaking me out.  Wow.  That takes a lot.  Yeah.  Because Ronnie doesn't fucking.  He just fucking rolls with the punches.  Exactly.  That Ron Bennington.  He wasn't rolling as much yesterday, huh?  He didn't know what was going on.  Really?  However, at the same time, you guys have not seen the commercial that's being questioned.  You guys may be deeply offended by the commercial as well.  You know what?  I'm deeply.  Fair enough.  I'm deeply offended by the fucking Cheerios commercial that Anne brought to our attention. 
[00:51:30]  That is.  Because guess what?  I wouldn't want to have Cheerios with my Nana.  Nana.  Yeah.  One of my Nanas was a complete and utter crazy lunatic.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Who yelled and screamed at little fucking kids.  Insensitivity.  When Nana came over, we didn't have Cheerios with her.  You know why?  We were hiding in closets upstairs.  You know what are good?  Honey Nut Cheerios.  Like Honey Nut?  I like the Honey Nut.  I like the multigrain.  I don't like the regular Cheerios. 
[00:52:00]  What?  First of all.  We call them Honey Crunch Cheerios.  Oh, okay.  We're going to go Honey Crunch from now on.  You don't like the word nut?  We don't say that like that.  Oh, right.  It can be misconstrued.  Oh, I misconstrued.  Oh, I misconstrued.  Jesus Christ.  It's my bit and I fucking forgot.  I forgot my own bit.  I thought you were actually just talking about the different varieties of Cheerios.  Of course.  I was.  I didn't even realize.  I'm on double patrol picking up these setups.  Oh, you certainly are.  Oh, it's good to a fucking seasonal allergies.  Yes, I have an excuse. 
[00:52:30]  I'm in another fucking world trying to figure out the combination of drugs to take so fucking  my body doesn't kill me.  I hope he needs like an AIDS cocktail.  Jesus.  Kind of concoction.  It's a nightmare.  Would you really hide in the closet when your grandma came over?  Oh, God.  I use closet, but wherever we can find a place to hide.  How is it?  Oh, yeah.  Is it a closet offensive, too?  I haven't figured that out yet.  We all hid.  Even though he means literally, he was hiding in the closet.  Not like hiding in the closet.  I mean, I pumped up the story.  We went upstairs to our rooms and just stayed in our rooms when Nana was over with a box of 
[00:53:00]  Cheerios wondering who's going to eat with her.  Yeah.  Nobody was coming downstairs for breakfast?  No, because that could mean the whole bowl of Cheerios was going to be dumped on your  head because you were an excited kid about something.  It's like we're having Cheerios with Nana.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Fuck Nana.  I hate that dumbass fuck commercial.  Don't try tugging at my heartstrings.  I'm talking about the Nana that called me Precious and I walked out on her deathbed. 
[00:53:30]  That Nana.  Precious.  Never have Cheerios with her.  My other Nana, we just called her Grandma.  Yeah, I would have Cheerios with her.  You would?  I had a Grandma and a Nana, too.  Oh, hell yeah.  I had a Grandma and a Nana.  Was your Nana your dad's sister or your mom's?  No, my dad's mom was the coolest chick ever.  Was Grandma?  She ruled.  See, my mom's mom was Grandma and my dad's mom was Nana. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, no.  She didn't.  The other one didn't even want to be called Grandma Nana or any of that shit.  Really?  What'd you call her?  I don't know.  Mrs. B or something.  No way.  Yeah.  You called her Miss?  Something like that.  Yeah, I forget now.  Like a formal name?  Yeah.  B was the first initial of her last name.  Not like Aunt B.  That would be ironic.  Aunt B because it was a grandma.  So I forgot.  It was like Mrs. B or something.  We hated her.  Ew.  We openly hated her.  This is your grandmother and the name that you're giving her is what you would call a  substitute teacher.  That's real. 
[00:54:30]  Like that's the emotional closeness.  That's loving and close.  Right.  Ew.  Well, fuck her.  Yeah, fuck her.  Yeah.  And fuck Cheerios.  I had no relationship with her.  She told all the stories.  She sued my mom when we were all little kids because my mom and dad needed a little loan.  Sue everyone.  They weren't paying back my mom's mom fast enough, so my mom's mom decided she has to  sue her own daughter that has six, seven, possibly nine kids at home, depending on what  year it was.  Depending on what's in the attic.  Exactly. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Judge Koch would throw that case out.  Fuck yeah.  So to the credit, my mom's credit, she blew off her own mom because she knew it was an unhealthy  situation.  And then, you know, I was in my 20s when she was dying in a hospital bed somewhere and  I went and saw her because my mom was saying goodbye.  And that's when she goes, precious, precious.  Don't try to make up now.  And I go, mom, I'll, you know, do it.  I basically said something like this.  Do what you have to do.  I'll see you outside.  Never acknowledge that this lady was calling me precious.  Wow. 
[00:55:30]  This lady.  Yes.  We had no fucking connection.  I, my mom's sister, I haven't seen in 30 years.  She lives in Queens.  Wow.  Queens is 15 minutes away.  It is kind of far.  You think so?  Yeah.  I literally haven't seen my mom's fucking sister in 30 years.  She lives a mere 15 miles from here.  God damn.  Fucking pure craziness on that side.  Crazy.  I don't know if you want to go that far.  So anyway, we're going to do the crazy commercial after the break and then we're going to do 
[00:56:00]  the Fez crazy shit.  Yes.  Nice.  It's shit, right?  It's stupidity.  Oh boy.  I'm going to let you guys be the judge.  What happened to him?  I don't know, dude.  Is he part of an edgy radio show where you kind of try to have an open mind about everything?  That's the idea.  When you start banning words and this and that, you're kind of closing your surroundings when  the word is crazy.  He's got a cause now.  It's like in the old days, it wasn't, you know, he's a little more socially active these 
[00:56:30]  days.  Although I heard, I read some tweets, tweets from people going, stop complaining and trying  to ban words.  And if you really mean it, go out in the community and do something, you know, volunteer at an  animal hospital or, or help the mentally ill or something instead of just, you know,  get on the air and, and, uh, uh, criticizing words.  But, you know, maybe it takes a while to get up to speed.  Who knows?  That's weird.  That's a weird cause to take on what he wants to ban the word crazy. 
[00:57:00]  I think so.  He doesn't, he, he wants people to be outraged against Chevrolet because of the, uh, how  that'll work out well for Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  That's good.  Way to go, Fez.  Who needs automobile sponsors?  Right.  Way to put your partner in a, in a tough situation going after a fucking car dealership when that  whole industry is dying.  That's good.  That's great.  See the USA in your Chevrolet.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  No.  They use terrible words in their commercials.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, look what I got.  For breakfast today.  What is it?  I see a banana.  Oh, I see some multigrain Cheerios.  Multigrain.  Wow.  So it's like you're eating with Nana.  Oh God.  Oh, do you see that look?  He didn't like that.  Venom.  See, I like blacks.  What?  Huh?  I like black people.  That's why I eat multigrain.  What?  Oh, it's like multicultural.  I guarantee there's a bit out there where I just know, and I swear to God I'm not pulling  this out of my ass.  I bet you someone did a bit or some kind of fucking survey or whatever where the cereal 
[00:58:00]  you eat says a lot about you.  Oh, I'm sure.  Look it up.  I'm certain of it.  Yeah.  We're going to break here, but we're going to get into some crazy shit after the break.  And I guarantee that.  Jesus Christ.  To the people.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show continues.  The Opie and Anthony Show continues. 
[00:58:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. 
[00:59:00]  Can we turn this into crazy day?  No.  We like our themes on this show.  Songs with crazy.  Songs with crazy.  There it is.  Crazy day.  All right, Travis. 
[00:59:30]  Travis on the board.  I noticed things are a lot tighter.  I'm going crazy.  Crazy.  Hey, ladies.  There's a lot of girls.  Hi, girls.  Hi, girls.  That's the morning mashup.  What?  It's three men and one woman.  I didn't even see a woman.  I mean, you know, I saw three girls.  What happened to the real girl?  Wasn't with them.  No?  No.  Maybe she's hungover.  Do you need it?  All right, here's the deal.  Fez, I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  He's taking up another cause.  Another silly cause.  I guess we got to see the commercial that started it all.  Yeah, but you know what?  Yeah?  I was thinking during the whole fucking commercial break there.  Yeah.  I was just thinking.  Mm-hmm.  It has to be done.  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's very nice.  That's very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid. 
[01:00:30]  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  O-S-T.  Hosts.  Holes.  Bits.  And stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I got a tree on my house.  Wow.  No.  I cannot believe we're kicking off Jocktober.  It seems like just a year ago we were doing the same thing.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  But we're kicking it off with our own Ron and Vince. 
[01:01:00]  Ron and Fez show?  Whoa.  I can't say...  I can't say that.  I can't do that to Ron.  Well, I'm saying with the Ron and Fez show, but yeah.  I can't say that.  It's elements.  Because you'll hear...  Uh-huh.  The show handles this well.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Okay.  We're focusing on Fez.  I can't do it.  I can't do that to Ron.  So it's...  Fez is being featured.  Yes, yes. 
[01:01:30]  For the kickoff of Jocktober.  Yes.  By the way, this is a bonus Jocktober.  This is a bonus Jocktober.  We actually have another Jocktober.  This is not an attack.  We're going to start off strong today.  We're going to do two.  This is not an attack.  This was not preconceived.  I have been working on Jocktober for a month.  Oh, yeah.  I've been working since August on Jocktober.  Yesterday, as I was finalizing today's Jocktober, I was listening to the Ron and Fez show.  This happened.  And I thought, on any day, we would bring this to the attention of you guys.  Sure. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  And you guys were getting tweets about it, so you were asking me, what's going on with Ron and Fez?  I was reading...  All of a sudden, Twitter blew up with talking about Fez and Ronnie and all the people from the Ron and Fez show going off on this topic.  It's crazy.  I mean, it was unexpected.  Yeah.  Insane.  No, no.  That's not good either.  So, I guess during the Ron and Fez show, they played a commercial for Chevrolet. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  So, do you want to...  I'm a huge fan of Chevrolet.  By the way, this was not...  Ow.  This commercial was not broadcast on the radio.  Oh, really?  This was a commercial that Fez saw on TV.  Oh, and was offended.  And was so deeply offended that he had to come to the show and bring it up.  That's good.  You like that?  I'm sure the audio's not making the rounds of the corporate office at Chevrolet.  This is the reason why we continue to have cum products advertising with us. 
[01:03:00]  So, that's all we could get.  We used to have car companies, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cars, beers.  See, we also do the commercial thing.  We point out the silly commercials on TV, but his angle is so different than ours.  Right.  Like, I don't want to have fucking Cheerios with a dead Nana.  No.  I leave a box on the stoop for Lee and Morty.  But you guys have less of a problem with Cheerios and more of a problem with grandmas. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently so.  Yeah.  I think...  Morty, do you hear me, Morty?  With Time Warner cable.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  I can't buy into the Time Warner thing, because the acting is so bad by Bill Cowher.  Yeah.  But his angle is very different.  He doesn't like the word crazy in the Chevrolet commercial.  No.  Do you want to see this?  Yes, of course.  We'll be the judge.  Maybe we won't even do this, Jocktober, bonus Jocktober, because we'll see the commercial 
[01:04:00]  and go, oh, okay, I agree.  Yeah.  Sam, why would you bring this to our attention?  Right.  This could be a Jim Chandler situation where we realize the show wasn't bad.  Is that what we realized?  Yes, we did.  Yeah, that's exactly what we realized, Sam Roberts.  A little revisionist, but...  Okay.  We're almost talking me and Jim Chandler.  Almost.  It's kind of like Washington.  We're waiting to...  Someone's got to make the first move.  Someone's got to make the first move.  You're following him, right?  We're getting there.  Yeah, we're following each other's shit.  How are his tweets?  You know, they're good. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I like following Jim Chandler.  Oh.  Down there in Nashville.  I think he's into Gwad, though.  Oh, really?  He had a Gwad tweet.  Does he have a personal relationship with Jesus?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure how deep he goes with the Gwad.  With Jesus?  With Jesus.  All right, so you want to see the...  Oh, you want to know what we did?  What?  Ooh.  It's beautiful.  Wow.  Kid party.  Uh-huh.  Jesus party. 
[01:05:00]  On the same day.  Wait, what?  How does that work?  Who else has done that in their lives?  Perfect.  What is that?  I got a daughter turning one, and she's still not part of the Jesus.  Not part of Jesus?  So we're doing it all in one day.  How do you do that?  How much does that rock?  You do one less party.  You do the christening before the birthday party.  All in one day.  Oh, you're doing a christening thing?  Oh, yeah.  Dunking that kid?  You go to a church, and you do the right thing?  Yeah.  Private christening.  Peel off the fucking bills. 
[01:05:30]  Private christening.  That's the good thing about the church.  You pay them enough, they'll do anything.  So we get to do it all in one day.  Private?  Nice, right?  Nice.  Am I the greatest relative ever?  You don't have to answer that.  You need that.  But I saved everyone a fucking party.  Exactly.  Because I know everyone doesn't want to go to these fucking family parties over and over again.  Do a kid party, next thing you know, you've got to come back up for a christening.  And we go, no.  All in one.  Let's do it all in one.  Smart.  Nice, right?  It's considerate is what it is. 
[01:06:00]  Birthday cake, we'll have a little cross, like, down low, just so people know, okay,  this is, the cake is for the Jesus as well.  Yeah, keep it Jesus.  Yeah!  Jesus.  No one from my family's going, though.  And forgive us our trespasses, we forgive those trespasses.  Forgive us our trespasses, we forgive those trespasses.  That's what church sounds like.  You realize in church that a lot of people have problems with S words.  Oh, God.  The whole fucking, the whole fucking church is abuzz when it gets to that word. 
[01:06:30]  I was never able to, like, that was always so distracting.  You get a room full of people blurting out a bunch of S's in a row like that?  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like.  And forgive us our trespasses, we forgive those trespasses.  Oh, I hate church.  Oh, it's so boring.  Even adding in the second party into the first party, your family's still not going?  No.  Why?  I thought that would, like, get people, like, motivated. 
[01:07:00]  It didn't work.  No, man.  It's the second child thing.  Yeah.  All right.  First kid, when he turned one, holy fuck, I had to turn down people.  There were so many people that wanted it.  Velvet rope, bouncer.  Oh, I turned down some people.  Yeah.  Not this time.  No way.  I might have to invite some casuals because, you know, we rented a restaurant.  Got to fill up that joint.  So I might start inviting the casuals.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you start some on-air plugs? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  I don't have enough.  I'll get them there.  I need some asses in seats here, people.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, everyone has their excuses why they can't go.  Oh, boy.  It's a shame.  Yeah, well, maybe they just are offended by the Jesus thing.  No.  Any juice?  That was the add-on.  Jews don't believe in Jesus.  They believe he existed.  They just don't believe he's the son of God.  They'll fucking believe when they're burning in hell.  They'll tell you that much.  They'll believe then.  You think so?  Fuck, yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Do you go to hell for having dreams where you rape people and then fly away?  No, it's dreamy rape.  Dreamy rape is fine.  Well, let's get into the Fez thing.  All right.  That was a little aside we just did there.  Beautiful aside, by the way.  Thank you.  Magnificent.  I've been reading Stop Stalling.  They want it, huh?  Do they fucking want it?  Sometimes I feel like we're on regular radio still and we got to eat up those quarter hours.  It's called eating up those quarter hours. 
[01:08:30]  Like Langoliers.  Yeah, man.  I mean, the one thing, you know, we give credit when credit's due.  Howard was brilliant at eating up the quarter hours.  He was very good at eating up the quarter hours.  We did pretty well in our own right, eating up those quarter hours.  What's that?  When you stall until...  You keep stalling knowing you got a little nugget and they have to listen longer and  then they have to fucking write your name down in the Arbitron Diaries.  The Diaries.  They had to fucking listen to them for two weeks just so they would get to one minute 
[01:09:00]  of audio.  And they realized those diaries were a lump of shit.  Yeah, they were.  Came out with the electronic monitoring and realized people were listening for two seconds.  They put down 15 minutes.  Opie and Anthony, 2 p.m. to 7 p.m.  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  So here's the deal.  Fez decided to talk yesterday.  And he has a problem with a commercial that isn't even on our channel.  No, it's a television commercial.  TV commercial, yeah.  We go after commercials ourselves, like I said. 
[01:09:30]  And it was this Chevrolet commercial that I swear to you, I don't think I've seen yet.  No.  And I'm big on commercials and big on picking out things on commercials.  I love commercials.  This, I wouldn't even give this a second thought as being offensive.  Okay.  Although I got to see it, really.  Yeah.  I'm just, I'm speculating here.  Let's see it.  All right.  The Chevy Cruze offers an EPA estimated 36 MPG highway.  That's crazy.  Crazy efficient. 
[01:10:00]  10 standard airbags.  And you get Stabilitrack with traction control.  That is like crazy protection.  This interior is insane.  It is insane.  I was going to say crazy again.  Visit your local Chevy dealer today.  Right now, get this great lease on a 20th.  Oh, my God.  I'm so offended.  You are, right?  He stopped a brilliant radio show for this.  Did you notice how many times she used the word?  Yeah.  He did. 
[01:10:30]  That was the joke, I guess.  Right.  I'm offended there wasn't one tart or spook in the whole commercial.  Yeah, that was the commercial.  That.  Yeah.  He didn't like the way they used the word crazy.  He said it was offensive to those people who are mentally ill.  They won't notice.  They're crazy.  Crazy has been around my entire life.  Oh, boy.  And I've been called crazy.  And, uh... 
[01:11:00]  Does it hurt?  Not in the fucking least.  It doesn't.  Not in the fucking least.  You didn't find that commercial offensive?  Holy shit.  Well, apparently Fez did.  And we got clips?  Yeah, we got some clips.  The first clip is, uh...  Oh, boy.  Ron and Shelby, who's the intern...  Who the fuck is Shelby?  He used to be an intern and now he's a special guest.  Shelby's hilarious.  He's great, dude.  I was listening to the show and, uh...  This Shelby's got a weird little midget voice. 
[01:11:30]  Yup.  But very informed.  Very, uh...  Big on pop culture, movies, things like that.  Bounces off of Ronnie and, uh...  And quite hilarious.  Is he replacing the other two guys?  Chris and Stanley?  No, uh...  Chris, Pepper Hicks, Stanley is just one man.  A lot of people get confused by that.  That's four guys right there.  So, wait.  Chris, Pepper Hicks, and Stanley?  So, is Pepper Hicks throwing his voice through a special processing thing to sound different  so he's now Shelby?  Oh, is he Shelby, too?  Oh, he's Shelby.  Oh, you know what?  I should have fucking...  No, no, no.  I fell for that.  Ron's brilliant. 
[01:12:00]  Hey, hey, man.  So, it's the same guy, but now you throw it through a few filters and now it looks like  he's working with someone new.  That's incorrect.  There's Ron Bennington, who we all know and love.  Call me, call me, Shelby.  There's Shelby.  Shelby.  Who used to be Pepper Hicks before they changed his voice to make it higher.  All right.  How does he decide Dave fit into all this?  Well, he has left the show.  And the Stanley Chris guys are, what, more behind the scenes?  Now, Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley is his own man.  Oh.  Yep.  Yeah, I'll never understand it at all.  Did Shelby eat the fucking cereal? 
[01:12:30]  That's a great question.  Someone did.  All right.  So, this is Fez or Shelby or...  Well, Ron and Shelby are talking about SNL.  So...  And then Fez brings up the commercial and they watch it and...  Oh, boy.  And this is where Ron goes like, what the fuck is going on?  Ron finally loses his mind.  I've been waiting for this day.  Go ahead.  Is this a bit or not?  Like, you knew it was a bit, but the way he played it was he was like a man in the street  that was doing these, like, awkward...  Pause.  ...interviews. 
[01:13:00]  Is that Fez?  That's Shelby.  That's little Shelby.  Wait.  Maybe they're reinventing Fez with the Shelby character, because that sounded sort of like  Fez if you sped up his voice a little bit.  Well...  I hate to pull the curtain back, but, uh, Shelby is also his own man.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  Just motocross places or the beach.  Oh, I think I saw that.  Yeah.  Just poorly produced.  You didn't know.  Is this guy autistic or what?  And there would be long, uh, fucking uncomfortable silences.  Yeah, and he'd just try to touch them or just mumble. 
[01:13:30]  It was crazy.  Crazy, but, yeah, now you're on SNL.  Crazy.  Have you seen the commercial that keeps using the word?  Holy fuck.  There it is.  I would so be out of radio.  Oh, my God.  You couldn't put up with it?  No.  That is hilarious.  So they said crazy.  And I have to stress no, because I put up with this shit most of my life, so no, I would  not be able to put up with it on a radio show. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  No.  There's no fucking way.  Kind of reminded Fez of the commercial.  Right.  That he was offended by.  Well, you know, when that happens, you know, I see how the thinking works.  And then he said crazy.  I love when Fez comes in with something, like, you know, when that thought is starting.  Gangbusters.  Hey!  Yeah, yeah.  Have you seen?  Like, he jumped in there.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Crazy.  Have you seen the commercial that keeps using the word crazy? 
[01:14:30]  Played all day yesterday from Chevrolet.  I can't believe nobody.  I looked it up.  I go, this Chevrolet can't possibly be using this commercial with nobody complaining about  it.  It's, it's.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  It's the two women in the commercial.  It's played during football.  Yeah.  Played during football.  Played all yesterday.  Well, I can play it for you here.  It's on the iBang.  Where is it on the iBang?  What's it under?  Corporate America, not as everyone friendly as they think. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, no.  The Chevy Cruze offers an EPA estimated 36 MPG highway.  That's crazy.  That's fucking crazy.  10 standard airbags.  And you get Stabilitrack with traction control.  That's retarded.  That's like crazy protection.  This interior is insane.  It is insane.  I was going to say crazy again.  See your Western New York Chevy dealers.  Qualified list. 
[01:15:30]  I'm totally missing you.  Oh, Shaggy.  The way that they so glibly throw out the terms crazy and insane throughout this commercial.  And no one has picked up on this, that how insulting that is to mental health care and  mental health patients.  Oh, my God.  I had no idea that's where you were going with it.  Absolutely.  I did not even for a second.  You didn't pick up on it when you heard it? 
[01:16:00]  Just how we're getting beat over the head with it?  We don't sit around and say each other is crazy.  We do it constantly.  Everyone does it.  When you disagree with someone, you say you are crazy.  But I think it's a different thing.  I mean, people shouldn't throw the word around so loosely.  When did this happen?  I thought we were worried about fag.  Now we're worried about crazy.  Yes, we're worried about all of it.  Why? 
[01:16:30]  No one's worried about it.  Yeah, that's my point.  No one has brought up how this commercial feels free to attack insane, mentally ill people.  Well, you'd have to be crazy, seriously, to be offended by that fucking commercial.  I had no idea where your head was on this one.  They just go over it?  No.  Remember?  We don't call each other crazy all the time or we don't call each other's opinions crazy.  Yes, we do.  But this is a...  Do you think being crazy is a good thing? 
[01:17:00]  No.  I am crazy.  I've been in a Michelle institution.  I get that you were like, hey, why pick on a race or a sexual thing because they're not crazy.  But I think that we could agree that crazy is fucking not a good thing to be.  And to point out things that are crazy makes sense for normal thinking people. 
[01:17:30]  Normies.  Fucking Ron, he's brilliant.  Wow.  He feels that.  Wow.  He was blown away.  Of course.  He was serious.  Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fez is serious with these things.  And that other voice that was going, oh my God, what is...  That, my friends, is Chris Pepper Hicks.  Oh, I know.  This is close to our heart, though.  You can't ban words in America.  I can't...  Like, how could you be on this channel of all places and advocate...  We're trying to fight the good fight over here. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Every word is fair game.  It's the only place left where we can talk.  This channel.  This channel.  Can't even talk in public.  No.  Like we talk here.  Every word offends people.  Yeah.  Of course.  Almost every word.  Was?  Was and the, maybe not.  But every other word.  Old people don't like was.  No.  Well, why would you call them old people?  That's offensive.  Oh, shit.  You can't call people old.  Graying Americans.  You know what old means.  Arthritic Americans.  Did I come off as ageist there?  Yes.  Oh, sorry. 
[01:18:30]  You did.  Gives a fuck.  Shattered hippians.  I don't know.  This is...  This is...  This is...  And then I get the tweets from people that go, why are you even doing this?  Don't you know Fez is a character?  Fez is not a character.  He's not, dude.  And I know that tweet was real.  Fez is not a character.  Like Mr. Amos.  He was his characters.  By the way, Paul Giamatti.  Great actor.  Every time I see him, though, I just think pig vomit, pig virus, whatever. 
[01:19:00]  Like, I can't look at it.  He's apparently in a new movie about the Kennedy assassination.  He plays this Spooner guy and stuff.  And I saw the ad last night, and all I'm thinking is, Nahad!  Like, I saw him in, uh, fucking Saving Private Ryan.  He was so good.  He had a...  Like, not a big part in Saving Private Ryan, but he's fucking brilliant in it.  And I'm just like, Nahad!  Even in Sideways, when they're going to wineries, I'm like, when does he teach the guy to say  the call letter?  Hey, yeah, basic! 
[01:19:30]  He's brilliant, but I will always see him as that guy.  As that guy.  Yeah.  All right.  How many more clips of this?  We have six.  I mean, they...  Did they get really good?  They went on for a little while.  Okay.  Uh, I mean, we can, you know, throw in the towel or pick our...  No, no, no.  Let's hear the second clip.  Let's hear a little more.  I'm all in so far.  I don't mean to offend athletes when I say throw in the towel.  Anybody who's ever had to...  That's true.  Throw in the towel.  ...do the injury or otherwise, I apologize.  That's true.  Uh, yeah, so this is...  The next clip is Fez talking about corporate America being insensitive. 
[01:20:00]  I think it's very insulting.  And when the Burger King commercial came out...  All right, let me see it from the beginning.  Okay.  Because I don't want you to go into a Burger King because I have no idea what that one  is either.  I don't know that this is a thing.  All right.  This is up on the iBank and see...  What is it as?  Corporate America.  Not as everyone-friendly as they think.  I don't know what even that means.  Because corporate America is always saying, no, we're always making sure that we're 
[01:20:30]  taking care of the needs of our customers.  We're sensitive to people.  This is really nuts.  And this is really insensitive.  Fuck sensitivity.  You are fucking nuts, dude.  Thank you, Ron.  He called them fucking nuts.  Bizarre.  Insane.  Paranoid.  Fuck sensitivity.  Holy shit.  First of all, I need to white out so I can get back to try to find out.  Because if you played this for me a million times, I would say, lazy, probably, dumb, doesn't 
[01:21:00]  really push the product, but insensitive or cruel, no.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Ronnie's great.  Ronnie, just, you're crazy.  Yeah.  You're insane.  You are nuts.  You are nuts.  He lost it on this one.  And it's not, I mean, if Fez is a bit or a character, because, I mean, his name is not  Fez.  Uh-huh.  That's the life he's chosen to live. 
[01:21:30]  The character in the bit is him as a person.  That's him.  It's him.  I don't even want an if in there.  He's not a character.  What goes on?  I don't get to listen to the show as much as I would like because I'm home by the time  it comes on.  I have to waste an hour listening to some dribble between 10 and 11.  You talking about Wednesdays or every day except Wednesday?  Oh, Wednesday, I like.  Damn it.  But does he talk about, like, his personal, like, what he does at night or off the show? 
[01:22:00]  Is there...  No, they'll ask him, you know, have you sucked any dick?  And he'll go...  Oh, Jesus.  He'll go, no.  But, like, there's a line between maybe catching a movie and sucking dick.  Right.  Like, there's other things.  Well, he doesn't do stuff.  In there.  They busted him yesterday.  Yeah.  Because I think he had said he wasn't going to watch the Buccaneers anymore.  Right.  Because of the Trayvon Martin thing. 
[01:22:30]  Wait.  What?  Right.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers, right?  I believe they said because...  What?  What?  What's the law?  What's the law in Florida that everybody hates?  Stand your ground?  Right.  Because of the stand your ground thing.  He can't be a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan anymore.  He said he wasn't going to watch the Bucs anymore.  And then they busted him because they got him to admit he was watching them on a laptop.  And then he said it was because they're going to look at stand your ground.  They're going to look at it again.  Holy mother of God. 
[01:23:00]  You're joking, right?  No, dude.  If he's pulling a work, it's brilliant.  He's not, though.  If he's pulling a work, it's a seven-year work.  It's a seven-year work.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Okay.  This is...  Oh, Fez gets...  He's surprised that there aren't more groups speaking up against this commercial.  Because they're too crazy to know that it's even going on.  And they're not even crazy enough to be offended by it.  Right.  Yes.  I don't get it. 
[01:23:30]  I don't get how you could be offended by that.  Well, first of all, I'm offended that Chevrolet would think it's okay to keep using those words  over and over again.  We use those words over and over again on this show.  You do, too.  And I'm more offended by mental health groups not calling them out on this.  Why are they letting this thing go by?  Dude, your fucking eyes are forced to...  Because they're too busy dealing with crazy people.  This is that point.  This is you leaving Earth.  It's done now. 
[01:24:00]  I was shocked when I saw this yesterday.  And I'm sure it played all day Saturday, too.  You're shocked because you think your toaster is trying to kill you.  Oh, my God.  That takes wacky to a whole new level.  Wacky.  That's not a good word, either.  Mm-mm.  Can't say wacky, right?  That means, um...  Well, it harkens back to, yeah.  To crazy.  Yeah.  You think it's going to be awkward in the halls today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Fez will probably blame me for this whole thing. 
[01:24:30]  Will he?  He's done it before.  Whatever.  He's blamed you?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who else has taken the brunt of Fez's blame around here for things?  Uh, like who's Fez been angry at on the show?  Yeah, Opie, right?  Yeah, but usually if Opie will say something...  Why is he mad at me?  Opie wouldn't.  Opie takes his shots at Fez.  Right.  Fez likes to act like I'm like...  Well, why is he mad at me?  Because you take a lot of shots at him.  No, I don't.  All the time.  Because you're the catalyst?  Yeah.  Yeah, Fez thinks that, like, I'm putting him up to it, when in reality it's because he doesn't 
[01:25:00]  want to fight with Opie, so, you know...  Oh, okay.  Look, he's offended, right?  Oh, yeah.  But to this day, he's done the most offensive thing around here.  And what's that?  And trust me, I didn't even care when he did that.  What did he do?  He walked around here as Hitler.  With a real Hitler mustache, not one you could go by.  You're right, he did do that.  I don't think you could be more offensive than that.  Do you think that's really offensive, though? 
[01:25:30]  But now, you fast forward a few years, and he has a problem with the word crazy?  It takes a crazy person to walk around as Hitler!  And then he walked through Times Square with a real Hitler mustache, wearing only a diaper,  and pronounced...  Well, that's just funny.  He pronounced himself as Baby Hitler.  Baby Hitler.  And he gelled his hair to the side.  Yeah, yeah, like Hitler.  But that's the subtleness of, like, over-the-top offensive and then funny.  Right.  Baby Hitler.  Baby Hitler.  Well, not many people are going to deny. 
[01:26:00]  That's funny.  However...  But coming in here as Hitler, completely dressed as Hitler...  You think some Jewish people might have been...  In uniform and everything.  Yeah, wasn't he?  Didn't he bombard the show one day in uniform?  Yes.  As Hitler?  Yes.  Do you think some Jewish people might be offended by that?  He did.  I forgot.  He showed up in uniform and bombarded the show as Hitler.  I refer to my Hitler video that I made back in the day on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  Oh, that's a classic. 
[01:26:30]  You've got some serious tweeting to do tonight.  I sure do.  Yeah.  Because when it's talked about on the show, I've got to tweet those videos out.  Go to...  I'm serious.  Yeah, I totally forgot.  That's like on the MeTV version of your YouTube.  It's like all the classic shows.  Yeah.  So you've got...  Oh, my God.  All right.  This is the same guy that now has a problem with the word crazy.  Holy shit.  It's here.  You did not come to work like that.  This is not work.  This is a mission. 
[01:27:00]  Fezzy has arrived from the Lana Fez show dressed up exactly like Hitler if Hitler was really fat.  Casual Hitler.  Oh, God.  He's wearing jeans.  Did you just say Hitler was really fat?  What?  Oh, my goodness.  What?  That's a problem now.  I don't think so, but I think it's funny.  Okay.  Wow.  But he does have a brown shirt on and a tie.  He looks like Al Hitler.  And your hair is... 
[01:27:30]  You've got the Hitler hair, not only the mustache now.  Some people are just blessed with the good jeans.  Oh, the jeans.  Oh, I see.  What?  Herr Watley is here to invite you to a party?  Oh, a party.  National Socialist Party?  Oh, he just did the Hitler salute.  September 24th?  Yeah, he raised his arms.  Yeah, yeah.  He did the Hitler salute.  And the curtains aren't closed, so any Jew that passed by would... 
[01:28:00]  He walked around the halls.  No, he walked around like that all day.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  You know, I know of a guy that did some controversial things on our show, and I want him to look  at this to see how it, you know, stacks up.  Troy Kwan needs to...  No, no, no, no.  He's seen it.  He knows.  He doesn't really...  He doesn't feel one way or the other about it, to tell you the truth.  But he almost got fired for saying some outrageous things, and Fez is now...  This ain't even on his radar.  You sure?  Yeah, he doesn't feel...  He knows it happened.  He doesn't feel one way or the other. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, we should hear that from him.  We could do 20 minutes on that.  No, to tell you the truth, it'll just be boring.  Don't even worry about it.  We could eat up a quarter hour with that shit.  No, no, no, no, no.  It'll be boring.  He doesn't have an opinion.  Let me hear more Fez as Hitler.  Oh, I was about to say.  And then we'll go back to what he did yesterday.  Do you want to hear Fez offended by the word crazy, or Fez dressed up and talking like Hitler?  He's out of his mind about the word crazy in a commercial.  We just want to remind Fez that maybe he shouldn't take on these causes.  But what is this, 10 years ago, or...? 
[01:29:00]  All in fairness, probably two years, maybe three.  Three years, maybe.  At most.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  September 24th.  Yeah, the date, nine.  Oh.  24.  Oh, nine.  Oh, okay.  Oh, four years ago, hey.  It's out NYC live broadcast for the Rod and Fez show.  I will be attending, by the way.  We need you, brother Kumia.  I will attend.  I enjoy everything you do. 
[01:29:30]  As we put the right back together.  What?  Brother Kumia, brother Anthony, brother Joe, Italy, Germany.  Right, we were pals at one point.  Reunited as it should be.  As it should be.  You're absolutely right.  Herr Hughes, you will be there?  Hell no.  Yeah, yeah.  Jim Norton, you are an uninvited guest to the party.  Oh.  A to the H was watching TV last night.  Yeah, A to the H.  Sam Roberts, Dean, not invited. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, me.  Don't make him furious.  Ha, ha, ha.  So.  Pause, can I point out that Ant's wearing the exact same shirt as the video?  I'm dressed the same as I was four years ago.  It's just that the mustache is missing now?  Yes.  You went through the mustache stage?  Yes, I did.  But you're wearing the exact same shirt.  I'm wearing the same little 5'11 army shirt.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I'm a fashion plate, you know. 
[01:30:30]  Is there more to this video?  I didn't.  Eh, it's probably the same stuff.  We'll maybe go back.  Fair enough.  So.  Yeah.  There's Fez dressed up as Hitler for the day with the authentic Hitler mustache.  Now, while you.  But he has a problem with the word crazy in a car ad.  Oh.  You remind Fez that he once dressed up as Hitler and came in here and spoke like Hitler.  In this clip, Ron reminds Fez of a commercial that was very famous for a very long time.  Oh, really?  Okay.  And I do want to say again, I don't give a fuck if he walks around here as Hitler. 
[01:31:00]  Of course not.  That's my point.  But the guy that does that probably should have more of an open mind about the word crazy  in a commercial.  I think like if they would have showed people that they came up and they're like wearing  like robes and they're spitting and drooling down their face.  And then they said, you can't buy this car.  You're crazy.  You belong here.  You're a crazy person and should be taken out of society. 
[01:31:30]  I might be able to say, well, I can see that or how, why that would offend some people.  But saying a deal is so good that it's crazy and insane.  We've done that forever.  Remember the guy that used to sell the fucking crazy Eddie?  Yeah.  My price is so low.  It's insane.  We're going crazy.  I got to go get those deals.  Yeah.  And you're like, those fucking speakers, $8 for speakers that will last through one song. 
[01:32:00]  I got to get them.  Crazy Eddie.  That's true.  Of course.  Crazy Eddie.  Made a living off the word crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Ron starts reminding Fez of songs that have the word crazy in the title.  Right.  And Fez says something that invalidates some of his.  Some of his.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he likes one of the crazy songs?  No, it is phrasing.  Okay.  It doesn't really make sense to what he's saying. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  All right.  Now, when the Burger King.  Do you know how many fucking songs are called crazy?  Willie Nelson had a big song by that.  CeeLo had a big song like that.  Seal had a big song like that.  Beyonce had Crazy in Love.  You're fucking nuts, dude.  Seriously.  Your paranoia is frightening me right now.  Those are also just.  Those are artists.  This is a corporation that's supposed to be. 
[01:33:00]  Why do you care?  It's supposed to be what?  Selling cars.  That's supposed to be friendly to Americans of all kind.  No, you're not.  Crazy is not a kind.  It's not an ethnic group.  It's something that can happen to some people.  And then you get meds to get out of being crazy.  You don't settle in and become happily crazy the way you have. 
[01:33:30]  I'm proud to be crazy.  You're not a crazy American.  As a crazy American.  No.  Our people have brought so much to this country.  This needs help.  Oh, my God.  I don't want my daughter bringing home one of those crazy people.  If they did the same commercial, and I don't like to use this word, but inserted the word.  Don't say the N word.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  If they put in, oh, this interior, it's retarded. 
[01:34:00]  People would be going insane.  You know what?  I don't like to use that word.  I thought of it, and yet you did.  He just said insane.  Right.  He had no problem.  He just said insane.  People would go insane.  He just said it.  And he said that people would go insane.  That doesn't make any sense.  See how easy and natural it is to just use that word as the, oh, boy.  And you should be able to say this interior is retarded. 
[01:34:30]  Because we all know what that means, too.  That's retarded.  Retarded meaning in a really good way.  Oh, it's retarded.  We used that word in a good way growing up.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That's retarded, man.  Oh, yeah.  If somebody's insane, they need to be locked up.  Right.  Because they can't function in a society.  They're insane.  Now, is that me saying I am anti-insane American?  You are.  And, you know, Fez proven on our point here.  We don't want any words fucking banned. 
[01:35:00]  None.  None.  Not a one.  No.  And this is what we said with the nappy-headed hoes and the N-word.  We said when they get the N-word, they're going to go for the other word.  And I think faggot was the second word.  And then they got rid of midget.  And they got rid of retard.  Jeez.  All those words now are taboo.  Yeah.  In most social circles.  Certainly in mainstream media.  Oh, my God.  You can't say any of those words anymore.  None of them.  So now if we take fucking Fez's lead, then we add crazy to that list. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Do you know?  And then they don't stop there.  That's the problem.  No, they keep going.  That's why you got to say no to all this shit.  When you start hanging out with somebody new, that's like the mark.  You know that you're real friends.  Because after you hang out like five times.  Then they can use the word retarded around you.  And you go, oh, okay, cool.  We're there.  We're cool now.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a different word for me when I hang out with new people.  And when they use it, I'm like, nice.  Now I know we can hang out. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know what word we're talking about.  Huh?  Huh?  We know your word.  Yes.  Guns.  Guns.  How many more clips of this craziness?  We've still got 30 seconds on this one.  Oh.  We've seen it.  All right.  It's retarded.  People would be going insane.  You know what?  I don't like to use that word.  I thought of it.  And yet you did.  And it just rolled off your tongue like I've heard you say it a million times.  Huh?  If they would have said this, this would have really pissed people off. 
[01:36:30]  Oops.  Cunty.  My God.  This is interior.  This is soft as a cunt.  So get your cunt out to your local Chevy dealer.  You're fucking nuts, dude.  Seriously.  You're not coming back.  In the world that I just know.  Wow.  He's right about the cunt thing.  He is.  People would be outraged.  Cunty.  I think that would be a cool commercial, though.  That would be.  I would buy a car if the interior was soft as a cunt. 
[01:37:00]  It's an attention getter, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it is.  That would turn your head to the TV in a second if you heard that.  Yeah.  Did he just say it?  He said it again.  What?  I know the auto industry is hurting a little bit, too.  You want to come back.  Come back.  Strong.  Get that commercial out there.  Cunty interior.  This Sunday during football.  Detroit, I hope you're listening.  You'll have the whole world talking about your product.  Fuck rich Corinthian leather.  Right.  I want a cunty interior.  Right.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Soft as a.  As a nice cunt.  Soft as a cunt. 
[01:37:30]  I was going to say teen cunt.  Jesus.  Let's see.  We have one more clip.  All right.  Okay.  And in this clip, Fez suggests what word they could have used  instead of crazy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  If the, if the joke of the commercial was they keep using the same word over and over  again, you could have used anything.  She could have just kept using the word awesome over again and could have gotten corrected 
[01:38:00]  on that.  Corrected how?  Awesome.  I was going to say, I said fantastic.  I thought you were going to say awesome.  It would have been the exact same joke of this dull commercial.  Didn't Toyota use awesome in their ads years ago?  Awesome.  We are driven.  It offended really cool people.  Yeah.  I guess so.  Uh, you realize that there were no human beings that were mentally deficient or challenged 
[01:38:30]  in this at all, right?  Yes.  It was just two people saying that this deal is so good.  It must be unreal.  I E crazy.  That's how we have said these are crazy prices.  Price is so low.  Oh, you're going insane.  You've never gotten furious about these commercials before.  See, I think that's the same excuse as saying that's so gay and saying, no, I didn't mean 
[01:39:00]  it in a homosexual way.  And I'm looking at you now and your eyes are not fixating on me.  They're rolling back and forth.  Holy shit.  Oh my God.  I don't know what they're doing with your meds, but the paranoia is gigantic.  Holy shit.  And where are the mental health groups that stuck up, that went after Burger King in their  commercial?  This is not even fun.  He's insane.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't even listen to what Ronnie's saying. 
[01:39:30]  No, Ronnie.  Ronnie.  He just keeps like, he's got the point.  He's going to just like over and over again, say the exact same fucking thing.  Fez Watley come cruising.  You look into his eyes.  He doesn't even seem to be thinking.  Till they roll over white.  This is so off the rails.  I want to think it's just a silly bit.  It's not.  I know it's not.  You give him a counter argument.  And instead of either countering that or saying, you know what?  You're right.  I didn't think of it that way.  No, he doesn't.  He goes back to the first thing.  No, he doesn't hear the other side of arguments. 
[01:40:00]  I'm insulted because the commercial just is who gives a fuck.  They should be able to do better than that.  You wouldn't even think of that commercial.  Or it'd be fun if the twist was, you know, they say crazy a lot.  And then, you know, the last shot is a fucking lunatic in the back seat.  In a straight jacket.  Yeah, it would be funny.  I would laugh my ass off at that.  It'd be good.  Like, look what they just did.  You watch football on Sunday, right?  I actually watch the Red Zone now, if you need to know. 
[01:40:30]  But they probably aired that commercial.  You probably saw it.  I didn't see it.  I have not seen that commercial.  Maybe you saw it and it just didn't register.  In the same western New York, so it must have been during the Bills game.  But that commercial was so nothing that I'm sure everybody saw it.  I guess.  And just forgot.  You wouldn't give it a second thought because it's so nothing.  Didn't realize you even saw it.  Right.  And I'm affected by crazy in my own life.  I don't give a fuck.  You didn't register.  No!  Any more of that?  I'd give a fuck that a crazy person could easily push me into an oncoming fucking subway trade. 
[01:41:00]  That's true.  That's what I give a fuck about.  Yeah, I don't like crazy people with bricks in their hands.  Right.  Now you're just saying that against crazy Americans.  We had some dude with a pipe, what, yesterday, right?  Where was that?  You tweet about it.  Brooklyn?  I was in Brooklyn.  Some guy decided to just beat someone with a pipe.  That's crazy.  I'm more worried about that type of crazy.  Actual craziness.  Real crazy.  Affecting, you know, my life, which it has.  That motorcycle gang?  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  They drove that guy in the Range Rover crazy.  Oh, that guy was crazy.  He drove over them.  Sure.  It's crazy.  Let's get past this, because I'm just annoyed.  What's left with this?  We just got to finish this clip.  All right.  And where are the mental health groups that went after Burger King in their commercial,  but not this one?  You pause while I talk, but you don't even respond to me.  Wow.  It's like I'm not even here.  See?  I'm just, I don't know what to do anymore. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know what to fucking do anymore.  Phil, you're on the Renafed Show.  Yeah, I was going to say the crazy thing is how that was shoehorned into a mid-SNL conversation.  Yeah, what started this bit?  Did you say something was crazy?  Did I say something was crazy?  You said something that was crazy, and that made it go off in my head.  Why aren't you furious with me, then?  Why don't you ever stop me and say what you just said is offensive? 
[01:42:30]  I'm sorry.  I just wouldn't mean you would respond to me.  I said we shouldn't use those words.  I'm going to use it all the time.  I'm going to fucking use it more than ever.  I want you to talk to your shrink and come back.  They're fucking filling you with some kind of pills that are making you nuttier rather than less nuts.  Crazy is not a good place to be.  No, and that's what I'm saying about this commercial.  I'm telling you.  Forget the commercial. 
[01:43:00]  I'm telling you.  You're on the edge somehow.  This is insane talk.  Wow.  Wow, Ronnie really digging in.  The lack of acknowledgement that Ronnie is even trying to educate him or make a point is what's really crazy about the situation.  Crazy.  That's craziness.  When you don't listen to the other side.  At all.  You don't have to agree, but at least acknowledge you just heard the guy talking to you. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, like he's not explaining.  He goes, what makes this different than this?  And there's just no acknowledgement that that question was posed.  No, then it just reiterates the opening salvo.  And Jocktober is off and running.  Wow.  That was bonus Jocktober from the Runa Fez show.  And this would have been brought to the show regardless of what month it was because it's happened yesterday.  And Travis Muir sitting in the office going like, what the fuck is going on? 
[01:44:00]  Right.  Has Ronnie ever gotten that adamant about Fez being a little off kilter on something?  It's very rare.  I'm going to have to listen now today.  See the follow up.  All right.  Well, the follow up.  Yeah, there's probably, you know, they'll probably talk about this.  What?  What about our acknowledging Fez doing the commercial?  Now we have to worry? 
[01:44:30]  No, Fez will be mad at me.  You guys don't have to worry.  But now, whatever.  Because you decided to cut it up and bring it to the show.  Because that's, yeah, because that's like, why would anybody think to do that?  No, we were absolutely going to bring it up because our Twitter's exploded.  Our peeps are out there.  Either way, if that conversation happened on any radio show,  especially on this platform, especially on this channel.  Right.  Yeah.  We'd have grabbed it.  You have to.  There were two.  There were three things people were tweeting yesterday a lot. 
[01:45:00]  The motorcycle thing we already discussed.  Yeah.  The Fezzy thing, which we just discussed.  Mm-hmm.  And the Mike Francesa from 1776.  How funny is that?  I only saw the first, like, 30 seconds.  I haven't seen that.  I was laughing my ass off.  What is it?  You haven't seen this?  No.  You didn't get the tweets yesterday?  No.  Were you off Twitter?  No.  I think Deadspin's got it.  So, you know, we got our own guy that calls us as Mike Francesa. 
[01:45:30]  Sure.  Mike Francesa is a sports talk show host here in the New York area.  Heard elsewhere, I guess.  Yeah.  Sure.  He's syndicated.  And he's a big, huge, pompous asshole.  And he's on the Yes Network, too.  Like, they broadcast his radio show.  Yes.  On television.  Right.  And there's a lot of Mike Francesa parodies out there.  Uh-huh.  My favorite is the memes.  The memes.  The memes.  The memes.  The memes.  The memes.  Meme's.  The memes. 
[01:46:00]  Where they put his big, stupid head on things.  Yeah.  On, like, wrestlers as they're coming to the ring.  Sure.  And it's Mike Francesa's head.  Or he's diving as, you know, he's got his head on fucking Larry Anderson's body.  Swagger.  Yeah.  That's one of my favorite Mike Francesa bits.  That is a good one.  And then there's the actual Francesa clips of him.  Just being an asshole.  The callers hassling him.  Him losing his mind on the air.  Him falling asleep.  Him falling asleep.  And then denying that he was ever falling asleep.  I don't think we ever played it on the air, but did you ever hear the clip of the couple 
[01:46:30]  that called in?  On the wedding proposal?  Yeah.  And Mike Francesa hung up before the guy could propose to us.  Oh, can I hear that?  As a setup to this?  Yeah.  He hung up.  Because he didn't want it.  Because he wanted to talk sports.  Yeah, and then I think like a couple days or a week later, like somebody brought it up  in a separate phone call and he denied.  That didn't happen.  Yeah, he's crazy.  Didn't happen.  Oh.  Shit.  All right.  Yeah, let's Mike.  So this is the wedding proposal?  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  And Mike is just such a fucking...  You could tell that he's setting up for it.  Then Mike...  We're not going to do that.  Wow.  Really?  Go ahead.  For A-Rod.  Mo in New Jersey.  What's up, Mo?  What's happening, Mike?  Yes.  What's up?  Good.  I'm hanging out here.  I'm with my girlfriend, Cindy, and we're both big fans in the show.  We're both big Met fans.  And I'm a little nervous, but you know what?  I'm going to ask her in front of the whole New York show.  Jimmy in Paramus.  What's up, Jimmy? 
[01:47:30]  Mike, I don't know why he brings himself into a corner with his A-Rod and music.  He just fucking whacked the phone down on him.  He hung up on him.  I'm a little nervous.  I'm going to ask her.  Click.  You never heard that before?  That's a good one.  I heard of it.  I did not hear it.  Cuts off a proposal.  Now, we hang up on people here.  Sure we do.  But we do it for the big, over-the-top laugh.  It's very funny.  He does it because he's just fucking annoyed.  That someone would dare, like, waste his time with that shit. 
[01:48:00]  Valuable airtime.  He's so full of himself that he's like, well, this isn't about them getting engaged.  It's about me talking about sports.  Right.  How long would have...  That would have taken a minute.  He was ready to say it.  It would have been a great moment.  What a dick.  That's great.  He might be so paranoid of prank phone calls.  I know.  He's got to be gun-shy.  Someone's not talking about sports.  Right.  He's got to think it's setting up for fucking...  Yeah.  I don't want to ask my girlfriend why you always fall asleep.  Fall asleep.  Fucking asshole. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Now, this guy...  So now this guy's doing a parody on that guy.  So that's good we play that clip.  Yeah, there you go.  So that's a reference to the people that don't know him.  It's called Mike Zahn?  Mike Zahn, 1776.  So this is if Mike Francesca had a radio show back in 1776.  1776.  Mike Zahn?  Mike Zahn.  Mike Zahn.  Mike Zahn.  This is insane and crazy, by the way.  Okay.  Relax with those words.  Chillax.  Chillax.  That's the way. 
[01:49:00]  Mike Zahn.  He's ready to go.  On the fan.  New York Sports Radio.  Mike Zahn.  Nice jingle.  There's a cartoon, like, drawn image of, like, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson sitting  at the, uh, fucking table, uh, broadcasting.  Oh, yeah.  And Mike Francesca.  Yeah.  With the red coat on or whatever.  Because it's 1776.  Yeah.  Mike Zahn.  Well, let's be honest. 
[01:49:30]  The Rebels probably have no chance to win.  But if the Rebels have any chance of winning this war, they'd better trust Benedict Arnold.  Look at the details.  He's got the Diet Coke in front of him.  Right.  Diet Coke.  And then he's got a crown.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Because when Benedict Arnold is Benedict Arnold, he's Cornwallis.  And when Cornwallis is Cornwallis, he's Alexander the Great.  So, if you're going to trust anybody in this war, on the Rebel side, Benedict Arnold's your 
[01:50:00]  guy.  Back after this.  All right.  We're back.  And now listen.  I didn't want to get into this, but, you know, everybody's making a big deal out of  it, so I figured, you know, why not?  You know, I was going to ignore it, but, you know, people were talking about it.  You know, it was in the paper the other day.  This idea that, and listen, I don't like him.  I don't like him, and I don't support him.  But this idea that Thomas Jefferson is sleeping around or fooling around one of his slaves, 
[01:50:30]  I mean, we are joined by Amanda and Lord and General and all the titles you want to give  him, because, I mean, he's great.  I mean, he's one of the best.  Lord Cornwallis.  Lord, welcome.  How are you?  Doing great, Michael.  How are you?  Picture him on the phone.  Listen, I don't want to bother you with this, but, you know, we've got to address it.  Because, you know, people like to make a hubbub about this, and I know you're a decorated  war hero, and, you know, this is kind of a joke to you. 
[01:51:00]  But do these rebels, do they worry you at all?  Are you worried at all about, you know, George Washington, any of these guys?  All right, we're going to go to Henry in Long Island.  What's going on, Henry?  Yeah, I was wondering, do you think the French might help the rebels out?  No.  Really?  No, I'm not sure.  He gets everything wrong.  Not a chance.  Because they don't care?  Why would they care?  You just don't want them to win, Mike.  Well, where is it?  What?  You're so negative about this whole thing.  Yeah, but Mike, you just want the rebels to lose, that's why. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, but the French, wait a second, the French, wait a second, the French, wait a second.  Wait a second, wait a second.  The problem is, and this is what has to worry you if you're supporting this rebel cause,  where are you getting your ammunition?  Where are you getting your support?  You don't have these things, you know, you don't have the resources of a British Empire,  of a King George.  You don't have the resources of a King George.  He's on the side.  He's on the side.  He's on the side.  He's on the side.  Dude, I mean, when King George wants to crush a rebellion, he's going to crush it. 
[01:52:00]  I mean, it's as simple as that.  All right, we're going to go to the phones now.  John on the farm in Massachusetts.  What's up, John?  Hey, Mike, how are you?  How are you doing?  Good.  Good, good.  Yeah, I was just wondering, did John Hancock sign that Declaration of Independence?  I believe he did, yeah.  I believe.  John Hancock.  John Hancock signed that.  I was wondering, out of all the people who signed that, who do you think has the biggest  cock?  All right, well, you know, that's what, you know, folks, we're in a time of crisis, I guess, 
[01:52:30]  so, you know, people want to act like clowns, you know, let them act like clowns.  I don't care.  I mean, they're not going to bother me.  They're not going to bother me.  They're not going to bother me.  I've been doing this for 25 years.  This is exactly Mike.  He's got all the features.  I mean, do you really want, if you're the Rebels, do you really want the French Avenue?  I mean, they're kind of weird, they're weird people.  I mean, you ever gone over there?  You know, I've met King Louis, okay?  King Louis is a weird guy.  I'll be honest.  Very weird guy.  Not, you know, he's a good guy, but weird guy. 
[01:53:00]  I mean, this idea that all men are created equal, says who?  I mean, who ever said that all men are created equal?  I'd love to know.  I mean, are slaves equal?  I mean, obviously not.  They killed more British soldiers.  Big deal.  Who cares?  You retreated the hill.  You're done.  The battle is over.  The British have won the battle.  And I'm going to tell you right now, the Rebels might be claiming victory,  but, you know, 100, 200 years from now, they're going to be saying, 
[01:53:30]  Bunker Hill is where the British beat back the Rebels and crush this rebellion.  God save the king.  Back after this.  That's pretty good, man.  That's really funny, man.  You've got to know Mike, obviously.  Yeah, you've got to know Mike.  But, fuck, it's Mike Zahn, Z-A-U-N, 1776 on YouTube.  And his username is Wait a Second.  Wait a second.  Good job. 
[01:54:00]  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  That almost sounds like our guy.  Yeah, huh?  Is it our guy?  I don't think so, no.  No, it's not.  I've met racist Francesa.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Does he look like Francesa?  He couldn't look less like him.  Yeah.  I figured as much.  Yeah.  He's like a tall, skinny guy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty good, though, yeah.  Yeah.  I like how he took the angle of supporting the British and getting everything wrong, much  like he does with his sports predictions and whatnot.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  The Diet Coke had me laughing the whole time.  Diet Coke.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to do another Jocktober, believe it or not.  Yes.  Whoa.  This is the actual Jocktober.  The official Jocktober for today.  So get on your...  We had to throw the Fezzy thing in there.  We couldn't help ourselves.  It was too good.  Get on your phones, your computers, get your memes and various offensive pictures ready.  Get ready.  Because...  Get ready.  I'm sure a Facebook page will pop up at some point.  Oh, boy.  I saw a Facebook profile set up last night. 
[01:55:00]  Somebody tweeted me, what is this?  And I can't remember what the name is, but the profile is the Trayvon picture in the hoodie,  but it's my face.  Oh, my goodness.  There's a lot of new Facebook profiles being created.  Yeah, okay.  Very good.  Zuckerberg's probably wondering what all the hubbub is about this month.  Probably should have saved that for your own show, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You were just talking about yourself out of nowhere.  I was talking about Jacktober.  No.  You were talking about yourself.  Did you see the commercial? 
[01:55:30]  And we also got Nick DiPaolo today, so very, very busy.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Uh-oh.  Let's go crazy.  It's okay, because Prince is an artist.  According to Fez, so thank God.  It's insane.  We don't want the ire of Fez over crazy songs. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, you know, back in this day, 105 years ago.  Uh-huh.  It's important because it's about a car.  105 years ago.  Henry Ford introduced a Model T automobile 105 years ago today.  Right.  And when people saw it for the first time, they said, that's fucking crazy.  Crazy.  A horseless carriage.  That's nuts.  Wow.  Thank you.  Well, the Model T was the first, like, mass-produced automobile.  Not the first automobile.  I know.  They had some shit going on before that. 
[01:56:30]  I get it.  But that was one that, like, it made it affordable for people, the ordinary guy pretty much to  get, and opened up the country to, you know, you used to just stay in one area, pretty much.  You'd fucking just stay there.  As far as your little horse and wagon could take care of that, bicycle, whatever.  But then, now you're fucking cruising.  Every once in a while, you would plan the big trip from Huntington to Northport.  Right.  For a vacation.  Yeah.  And what, it would take you 18 days to get there.  Oh, crazy. 
[01:57:00]  But that changed the entire country.  Amazing.  And we just take it for granted.  I know.  I mean, you just, you know, we're from Long Island, so.  You just didn't go to New York City because it was impossible.  Yeah.  They didn't really have the trains working yet, and I'm talking before the trains.  Oh, yeah.  You got, what, you had to have a horse and buggy, and then you had to camp out at a  whole bunch of inns on the way to finally make it to New York City?  And then you had to take a ferry, some kind of ferry over from Long Island City over to 
[01:57:30]  Manhattan Island.  Now we zip around like it's nothing.  But that was a long, long time ago.  I mean, in a lot of cases, it might as well be another country.  I guess they had.  Like, to go from New York City to Connecticut?  What?  People are like, what?  That's like another country.  That was crazy.  Craziness.  Insane.  Hey, I got to say hi to John L. Gray Jr.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  Really?  I get a little gift box here, which I normally get.  Normally, it's from listeners.  It's filled with some sort of Nazi propaganda. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  And whatnot.  But what a great little gift here.  Look, it's the Catfisher Fishing Rod and Reel for little Beavis.  And it's a little fishing pole.  And it's got a little mousy thing at the end.  And you cast it out.  And then you reel in your cat.  Oh, it's going to be hours of fun.  Basically, it's used to drive your cat nuts.  Insane.  Right.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Don't say those words.  It's a crazy toy.  It is.  It's very nice.  It's not nice.  And also a cat charmer.  It's the basic little snaky piece of material on the end of a flexi stick. 
[01:58:30]  You're so going to use that on a teenager's ass.  Oh, no.  It even has all the bright colors that teens enjoy.  What do you do with that?  Well, you stretch it out.  And you go like this.  And it goes down.  And you, you know.  And, of course, you never allow him to actually get the.  You keep it out of his reach.  Right.  And he goes.  Oh, it's great.  He goes fucking nuts. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you, though, John.  That was very nice.  After he gets bored of those toys, he'll just go back to attacking your limbs.  Attacking my hands.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was insanely crazy at about 1130 last night.  Oh.  Doing the bouncy thing.  Yeah.  And then just pouncing on my hand and grabbing my arm.  Look at this.  Oh, good habits.  Look at this.  Oh, that's great.  He grabs right there on my forearm.  That's wonderful.  And pulls.  Don't worry.  He shakes his head like a dog.  They don't get stronger as they get bigger.  So that's not a problem.  No, that's what I figured.  So it's okay. 
[01:59:30]  And the teeth don't get bigger.  No, no, no.  Something like that.  I have an adorable picture of him climbing up my back screen door.  Well, he's in the middle of the screen door holding on.  I wanted to bring up the latest pictures of Beavis.  Yes.  The shelf life on the kitten viral video is shutting.  Isn't it?  The door is shutting on the viral video.  He's getting a little bigger, right?  Oh, my God.  Yes.  It's getting too big now.  You've got maybe two weeks to get that viral video done.  Oh, God damn it.  Look at that.  I mean, that over-the-top viral video.  Yeah, he's kind of looking cat-like.  We've got Brother Joe. 
[02:00:00]  Brother Joe.  Oh, damn.  Brother Joe, by the way, we just decided you're going to be this week's nugget on the O&A podcast.  Oh, yes.  Oh, nugget.  Yes, you're going to be doing the Godfather theme.  Yes, the new podcast will be available tomorrow morning or today at midnight.  I don't know, whatever.  Wednesday is O&A podcast day.  But what's up, Joe?  I've aspired to be a nugget my entire life.  I just wanted to chime in on the Model T or the Model A, was it? 
[02:00:30]  We went to Vanderbilt Monetarium.  In a museum over there, they have Vanderbilt's car that he prided himself on driving on the parkways.  And they have some pretty interesting facts about this, you know, the really first person able to, you know, go through these E-ZPass things.  They had a primitive form of E-ZPass back then. 
[02:01:00]  If you were white, you got through?  Was that it?  A sticker on the front of the car that enabled him to go through all the tolls without having to pay.  And only the rich and famous were able to afford those stickers.  It should be that way now.  And the other thing was, you know, we were talking about how long it took to get from one place to the other, especially coming from the city.  We lived in Flushing when we were kids.  It was only, you know, 65, 66.  And to get out to the bungalow in Mastic, how long was that trip, Anthony? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I know.  It seemed like forever.  I guess because the expressway wasn't even fucking, like, built yet or something.  We used to have to go down, like, the Henry, what was it called?  The Horace Harding Expressway?  What was that?  Horace Harding, yeah.  Horace Harding Boulevard.  It was like the express, it went the same way the expressway goes, but only with lights and intersections the whole way.  In essence, it was the service road.  Yeah, that was a long time ago.  It was the north service road to the expressway. 
[02:02:00]  I could tell Joe's driving and he's lonely.  I could tell Joe's calling, like, fuck, I need to talk.  I'm taking Layla to school.  Aw.  Nice.  I'm driving to Palmingdale, taking her to kindergarten.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Is she allowed to wear a costume for Halloween this year?  Of course she is.  Fuck, man.  My kid's school, no costumes.  Really?  City school's different.  Why?  Because it's more politically correct.  But I can't get an answer why that would be a problem. 
[02:02:30]  Why is that a problem?  I see the parents.  They're all pissed off.  Their kid can't go to school in a costume.  Can Jewish kids wear yarmulkes?  Um.  All right.  But I still don't know why that is happening.  What is the problem?  Because some kids can't afford a costume.  Some kids, they'll be offended by their religion, won't like the fact that a kid is dressed like a witch.  They're liberal-minded.  They call themselves progressive, but they're fucking asshole lib lefties.  They're not being progressive. 
[02:03:00]  And once again, the minority rules for some reason.  Because, you know, like I said, I've changed my tune.  I see the parents, and they're all not happy about this.  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  But if some parent had a problem back whenever, and now no one can wear costumes for Halloween, so guess what?  My kid's not going to school Halloween.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  Because he gets out late in the day, so what?  He's going to waste all of Halloween being in a classroom not in a costume?  That's stupid.  By the way, Joe, are you letting your kid listen to this program? 
[02:03:30]  Hell yeah.  She listens to everything.  You're hilarious.  I'm kidding.  It's low volume.  I only hear it all.  Of course.  No, who cares?  That's good.  She should be able to listen to our Uncle Anthony say horrible things.  If it's anything she's not going to hear at your house, give me a break.  Well, that's true.  I've got to be honest.  We realized just yesterday that we've got to stop saying Jesus Christ in our house.  Oh, Jesus.  And he used it properly, too. 
[02:04:00]  He went, Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  I'm like, oh.  That's hilarious.  I think you might have got that from us.  Oh, my God is a big one, too.  Oh, my God seems to offend a lot of people.  Yeah, using the Lord's name in vain.  Sure.  Oh, my goodness.  Joe, did you see that video I sent you with that little blackhead gone?  Yes, I did.  Hello, motherfucker.  I did.  I thought.  Why are we playing it on the show?  I know.  I've got to find it.  The more you watch it, the funnier it gets.  The funnier it gets, the more fine.  All right.  We've got to go.  We've got another Jacktober.  We've got Nick DiPaolo waiting. 
[02:04:30]  Yes, yes.  Crossroads.  Crossroads this Saturday.  Friday.  Garwood, New Jersey.  It's to you.  I'm sorry.  Almost Journey and Unchained, the Van Halen tribute.  Oh.  And this is in Garwood, New Jersey on North Street this Friday night.  Be there.  It's going to be a classic.  Wait.  Are you doing the Van Halen tribute or is that another band?  It's another band.  I thought you were dipping into some David Lee Roth territory now.  If you guys get a chance, bring this thing up.  Unchained, the mighty Van Halen tribute. 
[02:05:00]  Bring this up and play it because this guy is a David Lee Roth clone.  Oh, really?  I'd like to see that.  Yeah.  Where do we go?  I'd like to see that.  What's the website?  Old school Van Halen.  Unchained.  I think it's Unchained.  Van Halen.  Tribute.  Tribute.  You've got to go Tribute.  All right.  Unchained, VH Tribute.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's see.  All right.  That's actually not David Lee Roth, huh?  Let's see.  No. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Hold on.  Got some videos.  The guy named Ricky, Ricky McCoy.  He's awesome.  The guy's real good.  My band Almost Journey with Gene Marcello singing Lee.  That kid is just, he's bulletproof, man.  He can sing like days and days and days on end.  Without his voice going out?  Yeah, that's nice.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:06:00]  Wow. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Not the best recording, obviously.  No.  Can it find a better recording, Samuel?  Well, you're not lying, though, Joe.  I'd like to.  So your Journey tribute band's playing with these guys.  Nice.  Yeah, we're doing a double hammer.  Yeah, Ricky's amazing.  He's all about the show, too.  I mean, he does David Lee Roth better than David Lee Roth.  All right.  We got a little bit of recording here. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  He sounds just like an old rock.  Well, it's just very good. 
[02:07:30]  Holy fuck.  That was pretty good.  All right.  The band is awesome.  They're real good.  And like I said, Ricky puts on the entire show.  He's real good at what he does.  Do you own their band yet?  Ha, ha, ha.  We've played with them a bunch of times, though.  Nice.  And Steve Brown is the guitar player from Trickster. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know if you remember that guy.  Sure.  He's an amazing guitar player.  Back in the day.  Very cool.  That's a great, great, Eddie.  All right.  Friday night.  Garwood, New Jersey, Crossroads on North Street.  Friday night at 9 o'clock.  All right.  Enough of you, Joe.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Have fun.  All right, Brother Joe, everyone.  He will be the nugget this week on the O&A podcast.  I'm glad he brought that up and redeemed himself from his Model T story.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jesus.  At least we got a little unchained Van Halen tribute band out of it. 
[02:08:30]  Where's Nick DePaul?  Is he still wandering around outside?  Uh-oh.  Did he give up on us?  I hope not.  Where is he?  There's Nick.  Hey, Nick.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, take a seat.  Take a seat wherever you want to sit.  You could either sit in the infected Jimmy Norton chair or the guest seat, whichever one.  Yeah, pop right down over there.  How you been, man?  What's up, fellas?  Good.  Well, the government shut down, so we're in a panic here.  Yeah, everybody.  There was the countdown clock.  We were freaking out.  Why is there another countdown? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, no.  This is T-plus.  Government shut down.  Oh.  Oh.  How long it's been.  The countdown clock was so successful on CNN, now they're doing the T-plus countdown clock.  Right.  So we've been shut down for eight hours and 40 minutes, and so far, nothing has changed.  How do you know?  We've been fucking sequestered here in this bomb shelter of a studio.  Out there could be complete anarchy.  Nick, you came in.  What are the streets like?  Total fucking chaos.  I'll tell you, there's mailmen laying down on the sidewalk, DMV people taking shits in 
[02:09:30]  the middle of the streets.  They just don't know what to do.  It's like one of those Star Trek episodes where if they get the one mothership thing,  all the satellite people kind of fall down and collapse.  They better get the government running again, or we're going to realize we really don't need  those fuckers.  Is it going to shut down on the weekends?  I think they do.  I guess so.  It does.  Right?  Has it ruined your fucking weekend?  And what happens on the weekends?  I have fun, and I actually enjoy the country.  It's great.  It's fantastic.  It's just a long weekend.  Right.  Or a holiday. 
[02:10:00]  It's a holiday.  But I think it's like, you know what the government's like?  The government's like a fucking lawnmower engine.  If you don't restart it often enough, you're going to be pulling that cord for a while  if this thing sits in the garage.  But those idiots get paid anyway there, Nick.  That's what we're learning.  Yeah.  Congress still gets paid.  Congress gets paid.  They're exempt from Obamacare.  Do you see a pattern here, you fucking idiots?  Wake up!  I don't understand how-  Jesus, fucking time for a revolution.  I wish I was 18.  I'd join a militia group tomorrow. 
[02:10:30]  Wouldn't that be nice?  I can't.  Now, I get my hips in bed.  We're both dressed for it.  Somebody was on the phone.  We didn't get to them.  They're like, why aren't people starting a revolution?  And the answer is very simple.  It's not bad enough yet.  No, because they put it in place-  It's got to get really bad, and then we'll fucking-  Not bad enough.  You got SWAT people going into your house during a terrorist fuck-  I mean-  It's not bad enough, I'm telling you.  It's got to get way worse for people to actually do something about it.  The government has put in place enough things to keep people, to make people unable to revolt anymore. 
[02:11:00]  We're not revolting for two reasons, okay?  $3,000 sofas and flat-screen TVs.  Okay?  Are you going to get off your ass?  That's true.  I'm not.  I'm pretty comfy.  We've come up with some cool things.  Pretty comfy.  To distract us.  We've got a lot of nice, shiny things to distract us.  That's true.  Maybe catch a bullet, or I could watch Seinfeld again.  Well, no, but I swear to God, the internet and the phones, that's all a distraction.  It is.  Everybody literally has their head down.  What a great distraction.  Their head is literally, well, figuratively, literally- 
[02:11:30]  Steve Jobs is Arab, wasn't he?  In a hole.  Oh, right?  Steve Jobs was in on it.  You're all in cahoots.  Yeah, that's-  You know what?  You're right.  We're distracted as hell.  Yeah.  I don't think people understand the true gravity of this whole thing.  Like, most people, they're paying attention on their phones to pop culture and TV shows  and not really the news and what's affecting them.  They don't know what Obamacare even is.  A lot of people think it's free health care.  But in fairness to them, how the fuck could you? 
[02:12:00]  You can't.  When the people passing it didn't know what was in it-  They didn't know.  Until they passed it.  We'll pass it, and then we'll read it.  Who said that?  Pelosi?  Yeah.  We'll find out what's in it once we pass it.  Once we pass it.  She said that with a straight face, the dumb clit.  They don't even read this shit.  Why would they?  You can't blame-  I'm listening to how a bill is passed, how a law is made, and-  Ooh, was it a cartoon?  And cloche-  That's right.  Cloche your vote, and then Harry Reid will send it back.  He'll put in language that says they are defunding it. 
[02:12:30]  That way, it'll be on record that they voted to it.  Then he'll strip it out after it comes back.  So how can you expect people who have kids like Opie, and a life, and a busy, to understand  all that shit?  Right, right.  That's why they don't call it congresspeople.  We're not supposed to understand it.  No.  It's lawyers.  They purposely make it complicated.  Of course.  It's lawyer speak.  Of course.  It's not at all representative of what the people want anymore.  Of course not.  It's top to bottom now, instead of bottom to top.  Yeah.  We are absolutely being ruled by the government. 
[02:13:00]  We don't rule them anymore.  We don't-  They don't do our bidding.  It used to-  Let's go way back to the old days.  I was going to ask you, when was the last time that-  That it was representative of-  Yeah.  I can't even fucking-  I don't think it was in my lifetime.  No.  Of course not.  No.  No.  But it used to be-  Maybe in the 50s, maybe.  I have a date.  1947.  47.  April 3rd.  There you go.  Somebody Google that.  Uh-oh.  There was a time, I guess, where you would have this local, local, yokel representative 
[02:13:30]  guy, and he would go to, like, the town hall with the rest of the townspeople-  And say, hear ye a lot.  And they would say-  He would say, hear ye, hear ye.  And then the people would go, here's what we need.  So now you go off and talk to the people that make this happen.  And then he'd go with a bunch of other town representatives to another place, and they  would voice their opinions.  And it would work its way up to the main public servant, where, you know, who would 
[02:14:00]  supply the money or whatever was needed.  Yes.  And it was truly representative.  Don Colleon.  I did never get to this.  Read the funny papers.  Dude, we had James-  We had James Kahn telling fucking Godfather stories.  Doesn't get better than that.  It doesn't get better than that.  James Kahn's talking about hanging out with the Luca Brasi character, and what a fucking  nut he was.  It was fantastic.  And how they had-  That was better than when you had Snuggie in here?  Just a little.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[02:14:30]  Same body as Luca Brasi.  James Kahn will be on the podcast tomorrow, right?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  The Godfather stories, mostly.  Not the whole interview, right?  No, just the Godfather stuff.  Just Godfather shit.  Did he have, like, dirty running shoes on?  I saw him on, like, center stage.  Yeah.  Once you're, like, over 60 and you're wearing running shoes, something fucking, you know  what I mean?  With, like, dress pants.  You're like, ah.  He wants to be comfortable.  Terrible.  I love him.  No, he's a fucking man's man.  You know, he's not kicking Carlo in the face with those things.  Little running shoes.  Flip-flops.  Yeah.  So your point, when they got to the main guy. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Then it kind of was truly representative of the people because the representative that  was sent out was doing the bidding of the people.  Now, they don't care.  Like, what people voted for Congress getting paid when there's no budget?  That's right.  The people never went, this is what we want.  We want you to continue getting paid as we're fucked.  Do you really think it was ever that pure, though?  Or were these-  I think for a very short period of time.  For a very short time, they were pure.  The system in and of itself corrupts it. 
[02:15:30]  A week and a half, maybe?  It makes it corrupt a week and a half.  They always had something in their fucking brains.  The power that you get by representing a group of people corrupts you.  And the favors that could be done because of that power base fucking corrupt.  Well, yeah.  The money got into the system.  Yeah.  The money got into the system.  These people that hold the office like a pope when it's not supposed to be that way.  Well, yeah.  We have to-  Term limits.  Term limits.  Part of the solution.  Oh, really?  It was never supposed to be a fucking career. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  It was not supposed to be career politicians.  That's right.  That's the first mistake right there.  Right.  Because they make it a job.  They build these relationships with businesses and cronyism and nepotism.  And you never get a pure representation of the people anymore.  Well, that's why they get the government running immediately because they're fucking up their own interest now.  They're fucking up their own fucking jobs.  They don't worry about getting reelected.  They concentrate more on what was-  On what was for the greater good.  The greater good.  Well, that's why Obama's giving you the big fuck you right now because he doesn't give a fuck. 
[02:16:30]  He doesn't have another campaign to run.  Of course.  But he's worried about-  Well, if he did this shit before the election, he would have a different tune, right?  But he's worried about the Democrats in 2014.  Sort of.  It's all about his legacy now.  Yeah, but his legacy depends.  This is his legacy.  Well, yeah.  Well, but you know what?  It's going to explode.  No shit.  That's what I'm saying.  You know, let it fucking-  I don't understand-  But that's why he doesn't give a fuck.  He sees this as his legacy.  So he's not going to fucking budge. 
[02:17:00]  Good, bad, or indifferent.  He don't give a fuck.  This is his legacy.  He's the biggest hoax ever.  He really is an amazing hoax.  Do you know anything about him still?  We don't have his papers from college.  None of his ex-girlfriends.  Hey, I dated him.  There's a guy that went to Columbia.  He took the exact same classes the exact same year and never fucking met him.  And nobody-  And if I raise that, I'm a lunatic.  If I raise that point, you're fucking great.  There are these stories that all the presidents have, if you look back to Bush and Nixon and  just keep going back, and you know exactly what they did from, like, childhood. 
[02:17:30]  Of course you do.  As a child, he did this.  And then he joined the military.  And he was a mediocre student.  George Bush Sr. was a fucking pilot.  And George Bush fucking-  George W. Bush was a fucking drunk who owned a ball team.  Like, we know all that.  There's like 10 pictures of him.  That's it.  That's it.  And he's not that much older than us.  So we're in an age where our whole lives are out there.  I have a bunch of fucking-  There's thousands of dumb pictures of us.  I have stills that look like they're taken directly from the wonder years of my whole  life.  And there's not one that runs the country. 
[02:18:00]  We have no idea.  One picture of him with a white chick that he took to prom.  Wouldn't there be different pictures of him every fucking day on Twitter and Instagram  and all that?  You'd think so.  You'd think so.  We've all seen the exact same, like, 10 pictures.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's kind of creepy.  It's like when Trayvon Manganron, they kept using the same photo.  Same photo of him and the little fucking-  It's creepy, though.  Hollister.  It's just that other people wouldn't just push their Obama pictures out there.  Why not?  That's what I'm saying.  That makes you look cool on Facebook.  Like, look, I got me and Obama.  Look, I have moving pictures of me and my brother. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  That's me and my brother Joe on Christmas morning in 1966.  Who is that?  That's me playing drums and my brother Joe.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  And, of course, I start crying.  Charlie of the 80s?  I start crying because the drums were sliding forward.  But you're playing the drums properly.  How old are you there?  Look, look.  Now I'm screaming.  I'm like, that kid's moving.  And my father's going, shut up, you little faggot.  Just play.  Stop crying, you pissy-eyed fuck.  How old were you?  How old were you?  I was probably six.  You had the Christmas tree from Alcoa, I see. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, Alcoa.  Yes, the aluminum tree.  It's always good.  You need a tetanus shot when you lean against your Christmas tree.  Are you the singer or are you complaining right there?  He's doing both.  He's like Phil Collins.  Wow, bravo.  This is great.  I'm doing Hotel California.  And my brother just keeps rocking.  And now I'm hitting the bass pedal.  And, look, I've got to slide the seat again.  And I really start losing my mind.  And, of course, my father thinks I'm going to grow up a flaming homosexual.  Put the seat up against the wall.  Then it won't move backwards on you. 
[02:19:30]  Who's that?  Your older brother?  That's right.  You're six.  That's my brother Joe, yeah.  Who, by the way, is still playing.  Is he really?  Yeah, yeah.  He just promoted a gig a mere five minutes ago.  Yes, after a wonderful Model T story.  It was a terrific story, Anthony.  So, anyway, the government thing, whatever.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if it closes down.  It closes down.  Then the people have to actually run it and do a...  Yeah.  I hate them all.  Although, I was saying, if I was a terrorist...  No, that's my stance.  I hate them all.  I don't fucking pick a side.  Yeah, one's more guilty than the other. 
[02:20:00]  If I was a terrorist, I would fucking pick this time to do something, because the FBI  is furloughing people and the fucking Homeland Security.  You can pick any time, Anthony.  Yeah, that's true.  They're pouring over the borders.  That is true.  It's not just people coming to pave your driveway.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  It's like one in every 13 that come over the borders from a country that's on a terrorist list.  I heard that like a year ago.  But nobody acknowledges your shit, and if you do, you're just fucking...  You're a racist.  You're a xenophobe.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  Because the flat-screen TVs are terrific.  It's hard to get up my ass. 
[02:20:30]  The new phones.  And who gives a fuck if you stay...  You know, we're staying home more.  The new phones are great.  That's true, though.  I'm fucking buying everything I lied.  I'm barely going to a supermarket at this point.  I'm going to Anthony's house within the next year or two and buy some of his used products.  Exactly.  I'm not kidding you.  I like the contrast between the picture on the second row, that one, and the one right  above it.  What?  Look at the contrast.  I'm a little taut right there.  One is called Christmas Bedtime.  Let me see Christmas Bedtime. 
[02:21:00]  The one above that time is shooting.  It's called shooting.  I don't think I've seen Christmas Bedtime.  Christmas Bedtime was...  My father liked staging events of Christmas, so he made like we were going to sleep.  It was me and Joe saying goodnight.  What are you doing?  Working at TGI Fridays?  We're wearing red and white stripes.  We're on a chain gang.  Holy shit.  We're going to bed for Christmas morning.  This is porn for Sandusky.  You're right.  I want to lick those kids.  They taste like candy canes in those outfits. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, my God.  You guys are making me believe you're having a bed.  And that's me, and there's Joe, and then we wake up, and it's like, oh, it's Christmas  morning.  Your bedroom has all the warmth of a fucking doctor's office in Havana.  It was the 60s.  They didn't really have a lot of amenities that, you know...  What town was this?  This was East Northport.  East Northport?  Oh, no, this was Flushing, Queens.  I'm sorry.  You're waking up your little sister.  God bless the parents, though.  Seriously. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  With the baby bottle made in China with the lead.  I don't know how to...  Oh, everything's lead-coated.  Everything is lead-coated.  And it's lead-coated.  And you're fine.  Of course.  You're all right.  Eh, a couple of paint chips.  And then the next one was...  Turn the sound up on this.  This is...  My father...  And look at what he grew into.  Man, that innocence of a child thing is overrated.  It's still going.  Still going.  Where are you?  I'm at the range. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, I thought this was in your kitchen.  I thought you saw a rat in the covers.  Yeah, that...  By the way, Nick DiPaolo's going to be at Caroline's every Wednesday this month.  Nine o'clock tomorrow night.  Oh, wow.  Every Wednesday, you got Nick DiPaolo at Caroline's.  That's cool.  Yeah.  And this weekend...  I'm glad you had this, because I didn't even know my own dates.  Oh.  And Bananas, this Saturday night, Poughkeepsie.  I'm working on a new arm shooting in Minneapolis in a month and a half.  Ah.  So I'm doing all these places. 
[02:23:00]  I do them all the time.  Anyways, let's not kid ourselves.  In the ballroom at the Taft Theater in Cincinnati, October 19th.  Very cool.  Which is...  That's going to be a good one.  And you're podcasting now, too.  In about probably two weeks.  No, I haven't started yet.  Oh, they just announced it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think I'm going...  I can't wait.  I will download the Nick DiPaolo podcast.  I cut my own commercial yesterday.  I'm playing with the equipment and stuff, actually.  Oh, really?  Pulling clips of my own for the first time.  Isn't it fun, though?  It is fun.  I like doing shit like that. 
[02:23:30]  There's two minutes of Hitler in one of my commercials.  And just, you know, I say we talk politics and you...  Of course.  Why wouldn't you?  And sports and, you know, everything.  I think I'm coming in Wednesday.  I'm going to go to Caroline's Wednesday.  Are you really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's tomorrow.  I'll be in...  You want to go Wednesday?  You'll be one of 19 people.  I don't mind.  I literally...  But I take the 9 o'clock show because I want to play with shit.  Yeah, exactly.  I have to go eight minutes with dead silence going to full house there. 
[02:24:00]  You know what I mean?  But it's fun.  When the shit doesn't work, I lose my temper.  People love it.  You know what?  I love that.  I saw Colin.  I saw Colin putting his show together in Long Island City when he was just putting together  the second show that he was doing.  And it was fucking great.  He would say something and he's like, no.  Oh, well, that didn't work.  I guess I got to put that one back in the foundry.  Nothing, folks?  Yeah.  There'll be a lot of that.  Oh, I love it.  But it's coming together.  I have this new hour and it's very dark and...  Nice.  And not on purpose. 
[02:24:30]  It just...  I took a year off when I came back.  Like, this rush of...  How could you not be?  Michael Douglas getting stroke hands from eating pussy and...  Yeah, yeah.  That's the lightest material I have.  That's an opener.  Yeah.  You know, it gets the crowd up.  I get six minutes on suicide and nooses and...  Holy shit.  ...sucide memorials.  And it's fucking...  God, it's great.  It's, uh...  Yeah, it's...  How could you not be dark in, like...  In this time and age.  It just seems like it's very hard to not be sarcastic and fucking just look down at everything 
[02:25:00]  and be...  Right.  Uh, just, uh...  And you can't even eat pussy anymore.  No.  No, exactly.  That's...  I got a nice chunk on that.  Well, not that Catherine Zeta-Jones pussy, maybe.  Maybe she's the problem.  There might be some going on with that pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I noticed a split spill after that.  There must have been some truth to it.  Yeah.  She's got some of that crazy pussy.  Uh-huh.  Crazy.  And maybe he wasn't just eating pussy.  Maybe he was, you know...  Going around to the back end.  Going around the corner.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Where all the germs are.  Where Michael Douglas are.  Where all the germs are. 
[02:25:30]  Where all the germs are.  I thought you meant around the corner to a, you know, a neighbor's house.  Oh, no, no.  You know.  Some of that Welch ass.  The entire undercarriage.  You know.  The entire undercarriage.  Crossing the railroad tracks.  Crossing Delancey.  Right.  I don't know.  Hey, you want to do Jocktober with us?  Nick?  Whatever the fuck that is.  Sure, I'm in.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Jocktober.  It's a wonderful time of year.  It kind of fucks up, you guys, when you have to, like...  Oh, if you wind up doing this show.  If you want to tap out, you're more than welcome.  Here's what Jocktober is. 
[02:26:00]  We beat the shit out of radio shows.  And then what happens, you guys think it's all fun and stuff until you hit the road and  realize, oh, fuck, they won't have me on because I was part of their Jocktober that day.  That's the last thing I need for my career.  Jocktober is, of course, take off on Rocktober.  What's this show that we're going to highlight today have an effect on Nick DePaul's career?  What city is it?  You do a lot of shows in Canada?  Montreal likes me.  Not Montreal.  No.  The first one is Canadian?  It's Canadian.  Wow.  We're starting Canadian.  We're going to Canada.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  It's in New Brunswick, Canada.  We take the Rocktober thing.  New Brunswick?  That's where my grandmother's from.  Oh, wow.  My mother's mother is like, yes.  Well, does she do a radio show?  Goddamn socialist.  She's going to get a beating.  She's been dead for quite a while.  Well, so has radio.  Good thing for them.  Yeah.  That's kind of like hillbilly country.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's like where Bonnie McFarlane came from?  Oh, she came from even further.  She's like in the sticks or something.  I love when Rich gets dragged up there and comes back with a story about how he had to stay 
[02:27:00]  on a fucking farm, the horses were trying to talk to him.  Didn't he get his wedding pictures done at a rest stop or something, service area?  Of course.  Yeah.  He told that story on the show because it was the best place to have that done up there.  No, it's really beautiful.  Planked every day.  Even the rest stop, the gorgeous up there.  Well, we're going to try Jacktober with Nick DePaul.  We might tap out, though.  We'll see.  Let's see what happens.  I think it'll work.  I'm confident.  There'll be some tangents.  These are your hacky fucking, hey, hey. 
[02:27:30]  Zoom on.  I'm on.  Yeah, crazy things that we spend the entire year pretty much goofing on.  And then for the month of October, we have Jacktober, and we feature these people.  And our listeners like to get involved, too.  They're very excited.  They log on to the Facebook pages of these people and post wonderful things about them  and pictures.  All in fun.  And whatnot.  It's all good, clean fun.  Good, clean fun.  We find happy people that are spending their days doing shitty radio shows and dismantle them  for no reason.  Right.  For no apparent reason.  Well, it sounds like there is a reason they're doing shitty radio shows.  I'm doing shitty radio. 
[02:28:00]  But it shouldn't even bother us.  No, it should.  If everybody else is going to be hypersensitive in this fucking society.  Right you are.  What do you think of the word crazy?  Crazy?  I don't have a problem with it.  You know, I've actually become a fan of the word crazy since about seven o'clock this  morning.  You guys don't talk about it.  That really offends Fez?  Yeah, I guess.  Did he always sound that gay before he came out?  No, I'm asking.  I'm dead serious.  I never listened to things.  They're at a good show.  Yeah, he did, actually.  And we all just made believe for many years. 
[02:28:30]  No, he sounded that...  But let me tell you something.  There's more...  There's something I can't put my finger on, but it's more of an authenticness to that  voice.  That voice.  Yes, he's kicked it up a notch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's less character-y.  It's not as cartoony.  It all just makes sense now.  It's less cartoony than it was?  I think it's more gay than cartoony now.  It used to go right in the ass.  Yeah.  Which makes me wonder.  And that's what I was talking about.  Like, he'd bring it down.  It doesn't go down anymore.  Like, it's not a parody anymore.  No, it just stays there up high. 
[02:29:00]  Why?  But I didn't hear why he was bothered by the word crazy.  He thinks it's insensitive to people with mental...  Yeah, to people with mental illnesses.  Let it go, you fucking nutjob.  Jesus H. Christ.  Because every asshole now wants that one word taken out of the fucking English language.  It's ridiculous.  Tell me about it.  And we said this day one when they were trying to get rid of nappy and the N-word.  We're like, no, you got to fucking defend this right here because they're not going to stop. 
[02:29:30]  I say that in my act.  I mean, as a white-haired sexual male, I'm down to like an L and a Q.  It's Q.  It's good.  Q is the queer.  Q is the queer.  Okay, an R.  Retard.  That would be Regan.  Or retard.  Try one.  No, you're right.  F.  Every word has it.  A.  G.  L.  Asian.  Adulterian.  A.  A.  Can't go lesbo.  And I've been running into it.  I like lesbo.  It's really insensitive.  T. G. Transgendered. 
[02:30:00]  Um, Z.  Z.  Z.  Z.  Z.  Zigger.  Zip.  Zip.  Zip.  Zip.  Zip.  It's some racism from the early 50s.  Right?  Look at the women.  I was thinking nip.  That's taking it back to the 40s.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, taking it right back to the 40s.  Yeah.  Really crazy.  And then they go after the names of fucking sports teams.  It's insane.  No.  Well, look. 
[02:30:30]  And again, all this shit doesn't come from the right.  No, no.  We didn't get the reputation as being oversensitive, did we?  No.  We're supposedly the bigots and the, you know.  Right.  And it's absolutely a minority.  No one's controlling this shit.  These fucking liberals, they don't understand.  To Blasio.  You just read this guy.  I cannot wait.  When I see the first rusted out abandoned car on the West Side Highway again,  I'm going to be like, we're back.  New York's back.  Squeegee guys are already fucking.  Oh, squeegee guys.  They're already chomping at the bit. 
[02:31:00]  Prostitutes.  I want all the TGI Fridays.  They're at Home Depot getting their equipment.  I want that M&M store in Times Square to be the S&M store again.  That's just fucking.  I want pornography back.  We just have to add an S on that.  Those are the good things.  Those are the good things.  But the rest of it.  I mean, the shootings are already up because of the stop and frisk being taken away.  But we're a bunch of pussies for allowing it, so.  Yes.  We are a bunch of pussies.  How do we stop it?  How do we stop it?  We can't do anything.  All we can do is vote, but our vote means nothing because the Democrats are going to get in.  Not in this communist city. 
[02:31:30]  No.  We push on this radio show why it's all bullshit.  No, you're doing your part.  We're doing our little part.  That does that.  Absolutely.  Our dumb little fucking part.  At least.  The least thing it could do is at least let people know I'm not an asshole that went  for this shit.  It might not solve anything, but at least with this radio show, you know it wasn't me, fucker.  He was sending food.  He was bringing food to the Sandinistas, for Christ's sake.  Yes.  He was fucking.  And he took his honeymoon in fucking Cuba.  The fuck more do you need to know?  He's a communist.  He's a fucking communist. 
[02:32:00]  His kid's got that afro.  And he's going to be the mayor.  His kid's got that afro.  By overwhelming.  Overwhelming vote.  Fucking New York City.  He will be the mayor.  You really get what you deserve.  I hope we're back to fucking where it just looks like fucking a taxi driver, the opening  credits to the odd couple.  I want some grittiness.  I want New York to look gritty again.  I like the gritty.  What do they do?  Look at history and just ignore it?  They go, yeah, I mean, Giuliani, between Giuliani and Bloomberg, it's the safest big city  in America.  Let's change that.  Change it.  This is what progressives do. 
[02:32:30]  We're on a great path.  This is what progressives do.  And they cry about it.  Like, like, and we're going to pull, we're going to stop the stop and frisk program that  day.  It's like, why would you, you'd be like, by the way, we're going to stop it, but don't  tell anyone because it sounds like a stupid idea.  It's front and center.  They love saying, well, look at what we're going to do.  It's going to be great.  We want an oversight committee on the police.  Did you read those?  Look over their shoulders forever.  So they second guess every move they make.  So by the way, they won't.  You're not going to get out of your car if you're a cop to do anything. 
[02:33:00]  Why would you?  When your whole career and perhaps freedom will be jeopardized, we'll be Chicago or Detroit  in no time.  No, absolutely.  Why do you think New York City, a giant city, lots of people, same minority makeup of a lot  of the other major cities that have a big crime problem.  What is the big difference, though?  The difference is that the NYPD has been given powers.  Proactive.  And they're proactive.  Yes.  They're trained very well. 
[02:33:30]  They have the right resources, equipment that's been given to them by the politicians.  And they understand that this is needed in a big city.  You look at a city like Chicago.  They don't have shit.  The fucking Rahm Emanuel is a fucking asshole.  It's safer in Tehran.  Yes.  But now you get a Democrat in there that's going to put all these oversights and stuff.  Why would a cop leave his car?  You're right.  Why would he question a suspicious-looking gentleman walking down the street when it could put him  in a lawsuit, could get him jammed up on the job?  They're not going to.  They're already sitting.  In no time, you're going to have fucking... 
[02:34:00]  They're for anarchy.  They always say it's a tea party, people who don't want government.  No, you fuckers.  You're the one.  You're the anarchists.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  With your fucking...  You're the ones who make change happen, but it's the wrong change.  The wrong fucking change.  I mean...  Come on.  Good luck to you, New York.  I love it.  Enjoy the ride.  Enjoy the ride.  I'll put on your helmet and enjoy the ride.  I'll go east to my little Long Island compound, fucking get the gun emplacements up and just  wait it out.  It might be suburb time.  Oh, trust me.  It might be suburb time.  That .50 cal could knock you out fucking a mile away. 
[02:34:30]  I'm on my roof with it.  Don't fuck with me.  You got some problems with that.  I got a drone.  You got some problems in your plan, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, you need a boat.  A boat hidden somewhere.  Oh, Jesus.  You have access to the water.  With a gun, you get a boat.  That's a good idea.  He needs a boat.  That's the one thing he's missing.  I'm in the woods.  I'm fucking...  You got to hide the boat because someone's going to find the boat.  I'll just take a boat.  Well, hopefully some boats.  People go, what do you need?  I need...  You need gold.  You need some food.  You need this.  You need a gun.  And then you take everyone else's stuff.  Exactly.  That's how it works. 
[02:35:00]  It's how the Democrats do it now.  People who vote.  Right.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  All right, people.  It's Jacktober time with Nick DiPaolo.  Jacktober.  Who's at Caroline's every Wednesday this month.  I'm going to play anything.  It's Jacktober.  Jacktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio. 
[02:35:30]  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportion.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jacktober.  O.M.T.  Host.  Holes.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for...  Jacktober.  I got a tree on my house.  You know what's great?  Wow. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  When Sam hands the disc over.  It is.  To make it official.  It's very, um...  Here it is.  It's like the Oscars.  That's right.  That's great.  A big unveiling of today's Jacktober.  We're going up to Canada.  Oh, yeah.  Fredericton.  Fredericton, Canada.  Fredericton, Canada.  Hot 92.3.  The hot tub.  The hot tub.  It's called...  Nick's in.  Nick's in.  It's the hot tub.  Nick's in.  I think I've done this show. 
[02:36:30]  Sometimes.  Sometimes I wonder if, like, our friends are in or not.  Nick's so in.  Oh, and you get the hot tub.  It's called the morning hot tub.  The morning hot tub with Joe, Benny, and Jay.  Wait a minute.  Two guys and a girl.  You're just relaxing.  Oh, boy.  Joe, Benny, and Jay.  I would say Joe is the girl.  I guess.  I don't know.  If I have to worry about offending a morning zoo show in Fredericton, I really don't have  a creative beginning.  That's true.  You're relieved.  We do some big shows on Jacktober.  Was there a bunch of Benny's the girl? 
[02:37:00]  Oh, Benny is the girl.  You're right.  You're right.  Is that right?  Yeah.  This is a classic situation.  You got two guys.  They're doing their thing.  And then these asshole radio programmers have to shove the chick in there.  For what reason?  I don't know.  Well, she's got to keep the guys in check.  Is she hot?  Let's say she's usually cute or hot.  That's the only good part of morning radio.  And Ed's not much.  I wouldn't mind a woman if she fucking just contributed.  Yes.  Thank you.  Bring something to the table like a sandwich.  Thank you. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you.  Oh, that's a good one.  Write that one down.  I'm throwing that man.  Yeah.  So I miss has a good head of hair for a guy who's rotting away.  He really got that.  He actually looks healthy.  He looks like a founding father.  It goes between looking like George Custer and Mrs. Doubtfire on any given day.  It's a little head of hair.  He really does.  He looks pretty good.  He really does have a great head of hair.  I like him.  Never met him.  Never met I miss.  You want to go over there now? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, he's great.  What, he's right in the building?  No, he'll have us on right now.  He'd actually love you on the show.  Yeah.  You should get on that goddamn thing.  You should be doing it.  I know.  I watch it and I go, hmm.  You should be on I Miss the Show.  Let me write, I'll write Rob Bartlett.  We have Nick DiBolo on the show.  And I was going to, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, Nick.  Fuck yeah.  You'd have a blast.  All right.  Here we go.  So, it's the morning hot tub with Joe, Benny, and Jay.  Yeah.  And this first clip, we get to meet the show? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  That was important to start out getting to know the show.  Get to know the old morning hot tub.  Sam has a lot of confidence in this today.  Oh, boy.  I am smiling because I believe there will be a strong reaction from the first track.  Really?  Right out of the gate.  Morning hot tub.  We're all just relaxing in the hot tub.  Wait till you all hear what the morning hot tub is up to, what they've been dealing with.  All right.  All right.  Fredericton's number one hit music station.  Number one?  Number one in Fredericton.  Well, who are they beating out?  Some guy with a fucking ham radio and a shit? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, they're bragging about nothing.  There's 11 people in Fredericton.  They're probably the only show.  They're the number one hit music station in Fredericton.  So, they're not even the number one show.  Just in the hit music world.  Yes.  Because there's so many hit music stations in Fredericton.  I think I'm going to kill Sam.  Don't say a word!  I'm not saying a word, but I think I'm going to kill you.  Go ahead.  Let's hear it.  Play the clip.  Just play it.  Why?  You're onto something?  I might be.  Just play the clip.  Play the clip.  Oh, no.  What's this? 
[02:39:30]  What is he doing?  I don't know.  Play it.  Play it.  Hot 92.3, down with Webster, party for your life.  Hey, good morning.  It's 954.  You're listening to the Morning Hot Tub with Joe, Benny, and Jay.  All right, so we're doing the, uh, well, we've had $10,000 stolen from us.  Of course.  The fugitive.  No.  No.  I told you we.  No.  I told you we can't do this shit anymore.  It's ruining Jocktober.  It's the same bit from every other Jocktober we've ever done. 
[02:40:00]  It's the state of the fugitive.  We can't start this way.  The fugitive.  Some asshole came up with his bit, The Fugitive, which is a horrendous bit.  It's so bad that every radio station in America and now Canada has decided to do the bit.  Yes.  They sell it.  There's like a company.  Don't even tell what it is.  That sells this bit to people.  Look, I heard.  No, come on.  I think we need to.  This is going to fuck Jocktober.  We need to stay on top.  Wait till you hear this, Nick.  I heard this story.  This radio station in Canada. 
[02:40:30]  No, no, no, no.  Don't even give away the joke.  Oh, you just want to play it?  For Nick, I want new ears on this.  I'm just surprised this thing didn't make national news.  Well, it should.  Or international news.  Somebody stole $10,000.  Yes.  Fuck.  Opie, I knew he would be so disgusted when it hit me.  So did I.  Oh.  We had $10,000 stolen from us.  Of course.  The fugitive.  Yes.  The new 1993 $10,000 fugitive.  It's been a busy morning with him.  It's starting at like 6.30.  We got a call from a guy who tells us that he's pretty sure he knows exactly who the fugitive is 
[02:41:00]  and that he's parked outside his house and that he swiftly is following the rules and  wasn't knocking on the guy's door until 8 o'clock.  Then what?  Just after 7 o'clock?  Why would he do that?  If he's a thief.  These radio bits are so bad.  Then they come up with a bit and then they lawyer the shit out of it.  So even if the bit might have some potential, they fuck it up.  Yeah.  Well, you need disclaimers and lawyers and rules and stuff.  You're not allowed to knock on his door until 8 o'clock even though he stole $10,000 as the  fucking fugitive. 
[02:41:30]  How about the cops bash his door down?  Then what?  Just after 7 o'clock we got another call from someone else who had someone else completely  different in mind.  Yep.  Both of those we now know were not the fugitive.  They asked the question and they were shot down.  Then we get a call from Constable Carmichael who works with the Fredericton Police.  Yep.  And you've been getting some phone calls.  We've had quite a few phone calls today and just wanted to call and kind of give an impromptu  hint that Chief Leanne Fitch is not the new hot $92.3 $10,000 fugitive. 
[02:42:00]  Like how you got to get all the calls in and the fucking frequency and the contest name  in its entirety.  Is that 10,000 Canadian?  Oh, yeah.  It probably is.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  Nick, to get the full impact of this, you must realize we've done this probably 10 times  with 10 different stations.  And it's always exactly the same thing. 
[02:42:30]  Are you saying it's trite?  They're called trite.  This is the hackiest lump of crap.  Then these shows wonder why they're not going anywhere in their careers.  We had some of these bits.  They're number one in Fredericton.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Number one hit music.  Oh, hit music.  I'm sorry.  We had some of these bits shoved down our fucking throats many years ago.  And we were the ones that said, no, we're not doing it.  And we got in all sorts of fucking trouble.  Rebels.  You got in trouble for that?  Well, the PD's like when you're a team player.  The one PD secretly told us it's all good, but the rest of the staff hated our fucking guts 
[02:43:00]  because we wouldn't go along with it.  What was it?  Was it the history of rock and roll?  Yeah.  We refused to do the history of rock and roll.  We ought to sound excited by playing fucking bad company.  Yeah, yeah.  Things like that.  See, we love the social media aspect of this bit.  Oh, no.  What's happening to their Facebook page?  It's so weird.  Their Facebook page has some really strange stuff on there.  Look at Travis with the cat.  I guess they are an edgy show. 
[02:43:30]  Look.  A Facebook user named Bobby Roberts.  Right.  Which is my mother's name.  Bobby Roberts left a photo of a young Travis with long hair holding his cat.  That's a boy holding a cat?  I know, right?  That's a guy?  That's Dr. Gay, our producer, Travis.  Now, what's going on below?  Oh, no.  Two men are making out in their underwear, and it says,  what happens in the hot tub should stay in the hot tub.  Ah, because it's the morning hot tub.  Turn up that sperm skimmer.  Oh, Hoagie Boy makes an appearance on the Facebook page. 
[02:44:00]  That's good.  That's good.  And that's when I went down.  Downs on her.  Oh, no.  Is that a dance?  That's a dance.  That's terrible.  Holy shit.  That's over the line of good dough.  That really is.  Well, this is an edgy radio show.  Let me tell you, we don't condone.  They're allowing it on their Facebook page, not us.  We don't condone anything that our listeners do, and we don't instruct them to do this to  the Facebook pages, but they just feel compelled to do it. 
[02:44:30]  They didn't even give out their Facebook page.  I know.  That's what's so strange about it.  So obviously, this is their listeners.  Did they shut it down already?  Let's find out.  Is that Benny?  Is that Benny?  Painted?  No, it's not shut down.  Okay.  There's a photo of a woman with a painted-on bathing suit on.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like Rachel Hunter.  Oh, it does look like Rachel Hunter.  Yeah.  The first comment says, I want to put my pecker in her and make sloshy noises. 
[02:45:00]  Is that from Chip Chipperson?  Pecker?  What is this, 1986?  Yeah, it's one of Chip's favorite words.  I mean, 1986?  That's a chicken fucking pecker.  That's a chip word, yeah.  This guy has a theory.  It says, I bet she's covering her lesions.  Oh, okay.  Which is a symptom.  Yeah, well.  She has lesions of fans.  Phase one achieved.  Comments are disabled.  Oh, comments are disabled.  Uh-oh, phase two already.  Is that it?  Phase two initiated.  What are the phases again there, Sam Roberts?  Because this is, we haven't done this in almost a year.  Phase one is they cut off the wall so you can't leave comments. 
[02:45:30]  Phase two is they turn off the comments on their own posts.  Right, so now you can't re-comment on their posts.  Right, and then there's total meltdown, I think, after that.  And then it's just, they take the page down.  As Polly Walnut said, what the fuck are you two talking about?  All right, so here we go.  We got to find out what happens with the fugitive.  It's a very difficult situation.  You see how many tracks are on this CD?  Yeah.  He's gone.  Nothing we can do about it. 
[02:46:00]  He's gone.  He's gone.  There's a lot of tracks on here.  Oh, yeah.  They're all fugitive tracks?  Every last one.  Oh, no.  Why?  I think we're going to ruin it.  Oh, the fucking thing.  Okay.  So people have been calling and trying to ask.  Not myself directly, but they're calling the main line and even the chief's office.  Gosh, that's a great opportunity for us to remind everyone that you have to ask face-to-face.  You can't, like, even if the fugitive were to get an actual call from somebody, they're  not going to fess up to it in that moment, right? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, they'll say no if it's on the phone.  I mean, you should never be jamming up police lines.  No.  Anyway.  Absolutely.  Good point.  And $10,000, some people may think is an emergency, but no, not at the top of your priority list.  Right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I love how that woman that works at the police office can chat for 40 minutes.  Yeah, exactly.  She's just yapping away about the fucking, some dumb radio promotion.  It's Fredericton, so.  Yeah, meanwhile, there's a moose in, you know.  I like how they're encouraging people, too, to not, you know, you got to see the fugitive in 
[02:47:00]  person.  So walk up to him and say, are you the fugitive?  Right.  So he can shoot you in the face and get away with his $10,000.  And play that in Chicago.  That should be a fun little bit.  There you go.  It's like everybody.  That should be fun, right?  Are you the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive?  The hunt for the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive is on.  I've teamed up with a bunch of my buddies, and we're taking on our spouses.  It's going to be guys versus the girls.  We are taking them down, and we're not sharing any of the prizes with them. 
[02:47:30]  Go us.  Screw them.  Hey, he was at the mall.  I swear I saw him at the mall.  I swear I saw him at the mall.  By the way, this is the other part that's so embarrassing.  That's why I love Jocktober.  All the phone calls you're hearing right now are fake.  Yeah, they're all the sales staff.  It's the staff of the radio station to try to get the hype going on their dumb fucking  bit.  People that work in promotions.  You can hear it if you listen closely.  Interns.  Things like that.  So annoying.  I swear I saw him at the mall.  I swear I could have saw him.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3 every weekday at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. 
[02:48:00]  Are you the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive?  See more at thenewhot923.com.  The fugitive is all about fresh thinking and healthy eating at Pita Pit.  Oh!  What was that?  Oh, they shoehorned and they ham-handed in a fucking sponsor?  The fugitive loves sandwiches.  It's sponsored by Pita Pit? 
[02:48:30]  The fugitive pit.  I went to school with a Pita Pit.  Hi, Mr. Pit.  The fugitive likes good eating.  Healthy eating.  All right, so we know the fugitive is not E-Rock.  Go to the website, they say.  Yeah, go to the website.  Yeah, I'll do that right after I call in to Restaurant Impossible to see how that restaurant stuff.  Oh, is this terrible?  They still think they could get people to fucking engage in.  I shouldn't do this on my podcast?  Is that what you're saying? 
[02:49:00]  Probably not.  I'm glad you're here to learn some things.  Probably not.  Before you get that podcast going.  You know what?  The thing is that you don't hear here, if you could just look at the behind the scenes,  in the office, when this happens, the program director calls in the air staff, all the air  shifts for meeting when they do these things, and discusses how important it is to play  it up, and have fun with it, and just presents it, and you're sitting at a fucking conference  table.  See, I've got to pit myself.  Yeah, yeah, with him standing up front, with the bulletin board, and the PowerPoint presentation 
[02:49:30]  of how this gets listeners, and look at our demos here.  The male demographic, 18 to 40, loves this.  Horrible.  Yes.  Do you have any meetings here?  No.  Not a one.  That's great.  We're starting to have meetings again, because there's a guy that knows this shit, so we're  finally-  But at least he's not here all the time.  But it's literally the first real meeting we've had in four years.  Timmy Sabian's your boss.  Yeah, we like him.  He knows how this radio works. 
[02:50:00]  He knows how this shit works.  But even he's like fucking in California sometimes, he's here sometimes, so it's not like he's  on us all the time.  You guys run the thing.  Yeah!  When those other guys that used to be our bosses used to walk down the hall and stand  there after the show, and they'd be like, can we talk to you about something?  It's like, yeah, on the way to the elevator.  We told them.  Let's go.  That's the fucking time frame.  That's how much time we gave them.  That's why people ask, you know, you're still doing stand-up?  Yeah, and I'll never stop.  It's the autonomy.  Yeah, yeah.  The autonomy of it.  It's you and the mic.  It is. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, that's it.  Like Leno says, tell joke, get check.  Yeah.  I'm a simple guy, and that's fucking-  No boss walking up to you.  No one gets in the way.  Nick, could we have a meeting?  We've had- I don't like what you said in about three minutes into your act.  Yeah, you had- we noticed you're having a few drinks, and you get a little angry sometimes.  Yeah.  The lawyers-  Yeah, that's my choice.  The lawyers didn't like the way it was presented because-  As I get older, I appreciate it more and more.  All right.  I don't give a shit if I'm 60.  Don't care.  The autonomy of it.  Yeah.  Well, Sabian's trying to set up other meetings with other people around here, and I don't 
[02:51:00]  even write back to those emails.  No.  I'll take one meeting with Tim Sabian, that's it.  That's it.  You deal with those other people.  It's the representative government.  He's our rep.  We talk to him.  He could then go off and-  He wants to have a meeting with the PR guy, and I'm like-  Mars?  I didn't even-  No.  I didn't even write him back.  Yeah.  Get the hit.  You have the meeting with the PR guy.  Ah, yes.  Right?  No, you guys are probably the lead ship here.  I mean, we could.  If the PR guy doesn't know how to fucking push us out there, I don't know. 
[02:51:30]  What am I going to tell him?  Mm-hmm.  I hear you.  So I'm not doing that meeting.  I majored in marketing in college.  It's the thing I know least about.  I'm not kidding you.  Yeah, marketing.  Why do you think I'm in Poughkeepsie, you bananas?  I know nothing about marketing.  I know nothing.  Are you the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive?  Here is your clue.  Right hand red, stop and stare.  I'll tell it all, but do you care?  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3. 
[02:52:00]  No, that's the point.  No one cares.  Wait a minute.  What was that hint again?  Ah, right here.  Weekday at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  Are you the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive?  The Fugitive is all about fresh thinking and healthy eating at PETA Pit.  All about.  All about fresh thinking.  If they know so much about The Fugitive that they know what he likes to eat for lunch.  Yeah.  Why don't they just approach him and request for their money back?  Just go to that place. 
[02:52:30]  He'll be there.  Yeah, exactly.  And I can't think of it all about it.  I can't think of one person that appreciates a riddle.  Ugh.  A riddle.  A riddle.  A riddle me this.  No.  No, thank you.  Batman?  That's the last time was good.  Frank Gorshin.  Exactly.  Frank Gorshin.  No one likes a riddle.  A riddler.  He's my favorite Gorshin.  Yeah, he was a good one.  Here is your clue.  Uh-oh.  B-T-W-L-O-L.  I hate text acronyms, so go to hell.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3 every weekday at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. 
[02:53:00]  Are you the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive?  The Fugitive is all about fresh thinking and healthy eating at Peter Pitt.  So he's a fugitive and he's politically correct.  Yes, he is politically correct.  He's about healthy eating.  He'll steal.  Healthy eating.  I think they should have said H-E double hockey sticks instead of hell, though.  Yes, it is Canada.  That was offensive to me.  They're pretty much giving up on the fact that it could be possibly real, by the way. 
[02:53:30]  Now it's just stupid.  I don't even get the premise.  Whoever came up with it should be shot.  Supposedly, I don't know, some dope fucking took $10,000 and now you've got to find the  guy that took the money.  And he calls in and gives clues.  He stole it from the radio station's prize room.  They were ready to give out $10,000 to a listener, but the fugitive, he took it.  And now you've got to find the fugitive, and then if you find him, you get the $10,000.  Well, there's 11 people in Fredericton.  It shouldn't be that hard.  Yeah, just line them all up, see who's got some cash.  No one wants to work that hard.  They want to hear Katy Perry do that stupid roar song, and that's it. 
[02:54:00]  And they go to the Peter Pit.  Right.  By the way, I've been in radio stations for a little while here.  I know the way prizes work.  Has there ever been $10,000 in cash laying around waiting for a prize to give away?  They can't even find money to buy lunch.  But they got $10,000 laying around?  In cash.  It went belly up.  They were bankrupt.  Exactly.  I was there in fucking what?  I don't know.  A year or something?  They hand you stacks of cash if you win the contest. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's how prizes are paid off.  Tax of cash.  Tax-free, yeah.  Here is your clue.  My favorite movie has characters, Vincent and Jules.  Make sure you are following all of the rules.  Pulp Fiction.  The reason for clues on the new Hot 92.3 every weekday at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  Are you the new Hot 92.3 $10,000 fugitive?  Staff at the new Hot 92.3 are eating well.  Fresh thinking, healthy eating at Pita Pit. 
[02:55:00]  This Pita Pit.  See, somebody probably went to them and said, well, it sounds like, you know, we're in on  this fugitive thing.  If it says, the fugitive eats at Pita Pit, you have to say, the staff eats at Pita Pit.  I get it, Sam.  You don't want to do Jacktober anymore.  Is that what it is, Sam?  You figured, do this first day, they'll say, fuck it.  The fugitive is a staple of Jacktober, and we will follow that fugitive wherever he goes.  Man, they're still showing the video.  Well, of course, they're going to show it all day.  You saw that story on the West Side Highway with the bikers? 
[02:55:30]  I was watching it.  You guys were explaining the fugitive.  I was watching it.  We started our show with it.  Oh, my God.  You got a perfect storm.  We got the Asian driver with a lot of motorcycles around him, and they want to do their thing.  And they want to be assholes.  The Asian driver is doing what he does well.  Which is being an asshole by accident.  Right.  Exactly.  Indeed.  And then he might have...  And his wife and kid are in there.  He might have...  Come on, you fucking...  He might have clipped one of the motorcyclists.  Not on purpose. 
[02:56:00]  One of them stopped right in front of him.  On purpose.  Right.  The motorcycle stopped, and he bumped his rear tire, and then they all gathered around him,  and he took off and rolled over a couple of them.  Broke one of the guy's legs.  And took off, and then they chased him down.  Good for him.  And he didn't fucking choose GTA rules, Grand Theft Auto rules.  He got back into a traffic-filled road.  He didn't stay on the highway, Nick.  Gotta stay on the highway.  He actually got off with a hundred fucking bikes.  You gotta.  Chasing him.  I had to went to a military base and picked up a tank. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  That's what you do in GTA.  You go, like, see motorcycles get at you then.  They blow by my house.  You know, I live way up there.  Uh-huh.  And I'll be out there, like, on a Sunday afternoon, and all of a sudden, I'll be watching a football  game, and all of a sudden, my team is drowned out for about 11 minutes.  There's, like, 700 bikes.  You know?  They're crazy black guys on rice burners.  They're insane.  They smoke up the tires.  Yeah, yeah.  In the city, I was walking.  I was going to the comedy cellar, and there's, like, 10 of them at a red light.  I thought that was actually pretty cool.  They're at a red light, and they're just winding their back tires, and the streets is filled 
[02:57:00]  with blue smoke.  You couldn't see, like, a foot in front of your face.  I was actually laughing at those.  Yeah, yeah.  But don't be beaten on, you know.  No, that's crazy.  Come on.  The video is unbelievable.  Oh, poor guy.  All right, back to this.  Here is your clue.  What was invented in a German town, I'll not wear.  My sense, my own, and I don't care.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3 every weekday.  You have to listen to all these clues? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, it just kept going and going.  I understand.  I've been monitoring this station for, like, a month.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Just getting the clues, and here is your clue.  Oh, no.  I'm tired today because I've got a little tyke.  Just remember I'm very close to a mic.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3.  No one is listening to the clues.  No.  And we've learned over the years they finally just give the fucking prize away to some idiot.  Yeah, you don't even have to listen to the clues.  Like, the last one is a dead giveaway. 
[02:58:00]  The last one is, like, all right, look.  He's outside Starbucks.  Tap him on the fucking shoulder.  I'm wearing a red jacket.  And a blue hat.  Right.  So all this is just nonsense leading up to the big.  It's to keep people listening because they think they need the clues.  But no one listens to radio this closely.  It's terrible.  No.  Here is your clue.  I don't tickle the ivories or know how to drum.  I've never learned music, not even to strum.  And I love to drink cum.  It's Elton John.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3.  Oh.  Hey, who's the famous DJ on the 70s channel? 
[02:58:30]  You know.  Oh.  At night.  Whose mic is way louder than it should be.  Because somebody.  Who's that guy?  It makes me mental.  I have to get this in while I'm here.  Get Danny in here, please.  J.J. Walker.  J.J.  J.J. Walker.  No, J.J. something.  Oh, not.  It's J.J. Walker.  Is it?  Yeah.  J.J. Walker.  J.J. Walker's a black guy.  Spider Harrison?  Yeah, no, but it's Spider Harrison under a different name.  It's Spider Harrison.  He calls himself J.J. Walker.  That bassy voice?  Yes.  But it's.  He calls himself J.J. Walker, but it's not. 
[02:59:00]  It's Spider Harrison.  Why is he so loud when he comes on the mic?  Is he really loud?  It makes me fucking angry.  Spider Harrison.  J.J. Walker on the 70s.  Why be J.J. Walker when that's Jimmy Walker?  That's what he calls himself, yeah.  I had it right.  It's 6 p.m., right?  Tell him to turn down his goddamn mic.  Look what we do to people around here.  Danny used to be well-dressed.  Now he just shuffles down the hall.  Oh, he's a bum now.  All disheveled.  Look at him.  He's 100 grams.  This guy loves radio, Nick.  Oh, he's a student of radio.  Danny.  Danny.  How you doing?  Dennis Falcone.  Nick has a question about SiriusXM. 
[02:59:30]  He's got a folder.  He's Schweppes.  Two pens.  Two pens.  Are you listening to Jacktober, by the way?  Yes.  His Sirius hoodie.  Is this good shit?  It's the tried and true contest.  Those are the national contests.  I did them when I worked for Clear Channel.  They did the same things.  Everybody likes them.  Everybody does the same.  Who likes them?  Nobody likes them.  You guys don't like it.  The DJs, we didn't like it because.  You know, you'd get the winner and you could just say, and congratulations to Bob Taylor.  You couldn't say he was from, you know, Missouri or something.  I got a question for you, Dennis.  Are you dieting or dying? 
[03:00:00]  No, I diet.  I diet.  What the fuck are you living on?  Dust?  I did the South Beach diet.  The South Beach diet.  What did you do with a fucking eight ball in the morning in the light of the sun?  Jesus Christ.  I don't eat the macaronis anymore.  The South Beach diet.  Even his diet is old fashioned.  Yeah, yeah.  He's fucking a wife.  I don't eat macaroni.  You don't need to lose weight there, Danny.  Yeah.  No, a couple of years ago, I worked at a place and we got a bunch of those books for free.  So I took one and I read the diet and it worked well.  How much did you lose?  Of course it was a free book. 
[03:00:30]  About 20 pounds or so.  20 pounds?  Yeah, I went down from like a size 30.  I meant how many years on your career.  Oh.  Oh, you're teasing me.  You should probably gain back another eight.  Another eight?  I went down from like a size 30.  No, the skin's getting a little saggy.  That's not just from quitting pasta.  Fucking please.  Eh?  AIDS?  There's no way.  What do you think?  Yeah, I think your ass is rotting out like a fucking tailpipe on a six-year-old bus.  Something is wrong with me.  We need an example of what Nick was talking about.  He looks good, I'm just saying. 
[03:01:00]  On the 70s channel.  Okay.  The guy's mic is too loud for Nick DiPaolo's taste.  Yeah, J.J. Walker there.  Tell him to fucking turn it down.  When he comes on, it's real loud.  It's hot.  Hot mic.  It's got a hot mic.  Hot mic.  I guess the fuck.  Yeah, but he's not saying anything important.  No, exactly.  So why does he have to be so loud?  He's loud.  But if you're not saying anything important.  Do you notice that?  I mean, I turn it down in the car.  Wow.  Okay.  Is he a boss jock?  He's a boss jock.  Oh, yeah.  So you don't turn it up louder in stereo and rip off the knob.  Hey, how you doing?  He seems like he's hurting for attention. 
[03:01:30]  I know he's been around forever, but.  He's a good jock.  Yeah, he's a good jock.  Why does he have two names?  And why is he a good jock?  What makes him a good jock?  He's got good pacing, good timing, good jokes.  He just sounds good.  There's no jokes.  He's the unfunniest thing I have ever heard in my life.  Here's Spider Harrison giving someone a shout out.  Keep in mind, he's Spider Harrison on Hits One.  Right.  It's the same guy.  And he's J.J. Walker on the 70s channel.  He's got to change his name.  We're not making fun.  We're just observing.  It's an homage.  Oh, okay.  I'm a guest.  I can shit all over it.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  I don't work for the motherfucker.  This guy?  Splatter with a wire.  I want to hear him on the 70s.  I can't hear you.  That's not doing it justice.  He's terrible.  He's like on a Radio Shack color radio.  Yeah.  Coming through.  The little flavor radio.  He'll be playing music.  Then he'll be eight times louder than the music.  But we have celebrity guest host Flo Rider on for me. 
[03:02:30]  Counting down the top 45 on Sirius XM Hits One.  That's not it.  I'm just hanging out.  What's the camera?  That's not it.  This is all in his house.  What?  He doesn't even have to come to work?  He doesn't come in.  He doesn't even have to come in?  He lives in Florida.  He's got a studio.  Why the fuck do we have to come in?  I don't know.  A lot of guys don't come in.  They have the easiest radio job to begin with and they don't even have to fucking come in?  I don't understand why Sam is giving away all these secrets behind the curtain.  Oh, yeah.  Denny doesn't like this.  I don't like that.  Get the radio from anywhere. 
[03:03:00]  That would rule.  I would sit on my couch and just fucking, yeah.  Well, that's why I'm fucking, that's my end goal.  That's my end goal.  That's going to be great.  But if you're a music jock, which is, let's be honest, no one gives a fuck about what you're saying.  It's all computerized.  You're right.  At the very least, they should make you come in.  Show up.  To make it look like it might be a real job.  He sounds good, man.  I'd sell my soul for a voice like him.  Oh, my God.  Why did you bring the company man in and ruin this segment?  That's why we do it, actually.  Denny, you've got a great radio voice.  No, I don't.  No, he doesn't.  Great son everyone.  He really does.  Let's see that.  I like that.  That old fucking. 
[03:03:30]  Are you the fugitive?  Ding, ding, ding.  The fugitive is Denny.  Oh, wait, wait.  I have some.  What?  Oh.  What do you mind have?  Let's take a listen.  Got some sound?  What do you got?  The radio.  This is like the first time in my life I ever had a girl to marry me, and she said yes.  This is this J.J. Walker demo.  No, you just need to play him introducing a song like that.  Yeah.  And it's all loud.  He just fucking makes it.  It's annoyingly loud.  All right.  So he's got a good voice.  Who gives a fuck?  Well, that's what people liked back in the 70s. 
[03:04:00]  I don't know if they ever liked it.  Yeah.  It was just there.  No, it was a hook by the industry, created by the industry.  Thank you.  It sounded good, though, but you have a very authoritative voice.  What would that mean?  It just sounded big.  If a guy was introing Freebird, but his voice wasn't like that, then you're not listening  to Freebird?  It didn't sound big.  Did not sound big.  Who gives a fuck?  You still get to hear Freebird.  It's just the announcers in a sports broadcasting booth.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck who's in there?  I'm watching it because it's the Pats.  Seriously, do you want to listen to Denny Green doing an NFL game? 
[03:04:30]  I don't want to listen to Denny Green doing anything.  Remember the coach of the Vikings?  I know who he is.  He's Denny Falcone.  He did not have the strongest force.  No, it's Denny Falcone.  Who cares if they don't have the strongest voice?  You're still watching the game.  Al might well, but to listen to it for three hours, straight talking, it just gets a little  good.  No, there's too many guys on the boat to begin with.  I need one guy.  I need Keith Jackson.  Oh, Nellie.  Oh, Nellie.  I enjoy it.  How do you sum up a rivalry between Michigan and Ohio State?  Well, it's about not liking somebody since about 1939.  It's the best. 
[03:05:00]  I go on one voiceover audition in L.A.  I'm coming out.  I'm coming into the building.  Who's coming out before me?  Oh, no.  Wow.  No kidding.  I went and I hear the script of the guy.  I'm not interested.  Yeah.  Is this...  What now?  He said, good luck.  Good luck, you little guinea.  That's JJ?  Yeah, Y100 Miami.  Back in...  What are you doing?  Picking every fucking show that I don't want to hear him on?  Go.  Hi, this is JJ Walker for South Park.  It's not doing it justice. 
[03:05:30]  Y100.  You're watching Smash Hits with Scott Shannon.  No, he's on...  Play something from last night.  He's on every night on the 70s.  All right.  He's got a good voice.  That's some voice.  Hey, you're listening to...  But you know what?  You're listening.  I'm not...  Oh, boy.  I'm listening for the music, you motherless fuck.  I'm not listening for the DJ.  That's the point we're trying to make today.  You see, when I would drive...  I don't listen to the music channels for the jock.  I want to hear Last Train of Clarksville.  I don't want to hear this.  What do you mean you do?  Why?  When I was a kid and we'd go on vacation somewhere, and the second the disc jockey would talk, 
[03:06:00]  once the song would play, I'd change the channel.  It was for another DJ.  See if I could find another station.  Wow.  He is Mr. Radio.  You know, a jingle he's playing or something.  You are...  Contest or fun stuff like that.  Mr. Radio.  Were you gathered around the radio near the fireplace?  We used to love doing stuff like that.  Oh.  It's the early 40s.  What are you going to do?  Exactly.  I say that like I'm 30.  You forget I'm 51.  That station in Canada?  20 good years left.  Did you like them?  Maybe.  Did you like them?  I'm studying my own shits after I take them off. 
[03:06:30]  I'm looking for blood.  You've got to see what's in there.  The other night, I'm like, oh!  Oh, it's Tabasco.  Jesus.  Any organs coming out?  Do you need?  Don't drink beet juice.  I would never try.  I would drink that.  That'll trick you every fucking time.  Beet juice.  No reason to eat.  The one food I don't like on the earth.  It makes the entire...  No, I hate eating beets, but I'll put it in the juice.  It's easy.  It's easy in the juice.  Here's more, Jack Tober.  Denny, you might as well stay where you are.  Here is your clue.  No.  Close. 
[03:07:00]  Throwback.  Born in the 80s.  This narrows your search, so find me maybe.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3.  Can you even rhyme?  No.  See, that sounds like J.J.  He's that loud.  Yeah, because they put some processing on some guy's voice.  Here is your clue.  No more, please.  I'm not so old, and I'm not quite young.  I bet you didn't know I can't curl my tongue.  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3.  Why would we know this?  Oh, maybe we have to listen.  These clues are a little broad, aren't they?  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  I have a head, and I take dumps.  Oh, no Pita Pit commercial?  What the fuck?  Looking for some Pita Pit.  This is exhausting, Sam.  It really is, Sam.  We haven't even heard the morning hot tub.  I know.  I wanted to hear the morning hot tub.  We're hearing a voiceover guy.  And their wonderful chemistry.  That's a fun name.  Welcome to Jacktober.  That's a fun name for a show.  The bit so lame, I can't even get excited about it.  I know.  Here is your clue.  Jesus.  If the ice cream fairy gave me just one to pick, vanilla is the one I'd want to lick. 
[03:08:00]  Listen for clues on the new Hot 92.3.  Danny, are you?  Jerry Sandusky.  Are you engaged in this or what?  It's too deep.  But again, we don't listen all the time, so that's not a local or regular station, so  I have no idea what they're talking about.  Right.  I don't know what the clues are.  Well, the clue is that the fugitive likes vanilla ice cream.  I don't understand.  Gee, that narrows it down.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't get the fucking...  I don't either.  I don't get the whole premise.  This is stupid.  I really don't.  It's sad, because what they could be doing with their radio shows, and you have to listen 
[03:08:30]  to some asshole down the hall.  Look at Sanders Smith up there.  Yeah.  Well, I missed it.  But you have to pay for that contest, so they just sell the contest to the radio station.  It's the same thing over and over.  I'm going to...  I swear I'm going to opt for tapping out of the rest of this.  Really?  How many fucking clips are there of him just saying what the...  I think they're finally going to talk as the morning hot tubers.  What?  Yeah, what are we at?  To number 13?  All right, the moment we've all been waiting for, we are here.  No one's been waiting for.  We've all been waiting.  No, we haven't.  I was in the car listening to you guys going, oh, they're talking about all the shit that 
[03:09:00]  I love to get in on.  And I get here when you're doing this.  Yeah, and we do this.  You're right.  You're right with you.  We were.  We were talking about all that other shit.  Hispanic bikers and fucking...  Oh, God.  We did that.  Not when I was here.  I know.  Now you've got to listen to this stupid fugitive shit.  Do you guys have Jesse Ventura today?  I saw him in the hall.  Oh, he hates us now.  No, he won't do our show anymore.  Jimmy ruined that one.  He touched Jimmy Norton.  Thank you for your service.  Have you seen him walk around?  Yeah.  I said, good morning, sir.  He goes, don't call me sir.  I was an enlisted man. 
[03:09:30]  I said, oh, stripes.  Remember that line in the movie, Stripes?  Sorry, Nick.  Sergeant Holka.  Sergeant Holka.  Look, I came in here 45 minutes late, and then he comes in and fucking steals my phone.  And he just fucking...  Dennis, you're on Air Talent, no?  Not really.  He's almost.  I'm on the 60s channel.  Yes, I am.  I'm a disc jockey on this.  I am.  You have a nice talent.  You're on a regular basis.  Dennis has a good radio voice.  That's not regular.  Regular is like Monday through Friday.  Once a week.  Regular.  If you shit once a week, would you call it regular? 
[03:10:00]  Good point, Nick.  Or irregular.  Even though we're not giving you our best material right now, you're still killing it, Nick.  I'm trying, man.  I just want you to know.  I look at my openings.  It's the difference between getting 21 people and 23 people at Caroline.  Caroline's every Wednesday.  Yes.  This month, Nick DiPaolo.  Yeah.  And Bananas and Poughkeepsie.  Can't believe I keep saying that.  And The Ballroom, The Taft Theater, Cincinnati, Ohio, October 19th.  And Helium and Buffalo, which is a great one. 
[03:10:30]  Ah, yes.  We hear good things about Helium and Buffalo.  I mean, if we do this quick, then we'll have some time to get into some other shit with Nick DiPaolo.  All right.  The moment we've all been waiting for, we are here with The Fugitive.  Hello, Mr. Fugitive.  I guess I can call you Mr. now because we know you're a man.  What is your name?  Morgan Peters.  Morgan Peters.  It's so great to finally meet The Fugitive.  She sounds cute.  I feel like I know so much about you.  That might be a little bit creepy.  But I guess all of Fredericton knows a lot about you.  So what I want to know really is, as the social media coordinator here at the NewHot92.3, 
[03:11:00]  a lot of my job is based around the internet, around Twitter, around Facebook.  Well, yeah.  The social media coordinator?  Yeah.  Got one of those now?  Oh, yeah.  Nice title.  Are they doing a twist on The Fugitive bit?  They did a twist on it?  That's The Fugitive.  They found him.  And so now they're interviewing him.  Who is he?  He's just some dude.  I wish he jumped into the waterfall.  But wasn't The Fugitive someone that worked at the station, and then you'd have to find  him? 
[03:11:30]  But now it sounds like a listener is dubbed The Fugitive.  It's always just some dude.  It's not supposed to be a station worker.  Some asshole.  Oh, you got something to add to this?  Ah, Troy Kwan.  Hey, you got something to add to this?  Troy.  See you later, buddy.  What's up?  Good to see you, buddy.  Thumbs up.  Good news for Nick Tavala.  What's up?  You asked for him introing some fucking records.  We got it.  Right.  Oh, what's his name?  Yeah, hold on.  J.J. Jackson.  No, J.J. Walker.  You got to have the music and then him coming in to see how loud he is. 
[03:12:00]  Fuck.  And that's precisely why you stole $10,000 from us.  That's right.  I generally feel that we've gone too far that way.  Wow, this guy's a ball of fire.  We don't interact with each other enough anymore.  This is the worst thing I've ever heard of.  In order to force people to talk to each other more face-to-face.  What an angry criminal.  Oh, there's a message.  Oh, I like that they're going with the message.  He stole the money to get people to talk to each other face-to-face because you had 
[03:12:30]  to go and say, are you the fugitive?  Because people aren't talking to each other anymore.  The fugitive.  But why would you be talking face-to-face?  How does this induce people to talk face-to-face?  I think because you have to walk up to somebody that you think is the fugitive and say, are  you the fucking 90s shit fucker?  And the guy turns around and stabs you.  And stabs you.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And a butt stop.  Okay.  So it's eating your face.  Yes.  What's wrong, Sam?  It's just weird that they, because their social media is blowing up.  Right.  Like under some of their pictures.  Like one comment is, this was all Nick DiPaolo's idea. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, why would they do that?  Anthony had nine teeth pulled.  No.  Nick DiPaolo is the mastermind of this evil.  Yeah.  Oh, Nick, you'll never be on that station.  Blacklisted in Canada.  A lot of people asking for turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  One person just simply writes, I got a tree on my house.  I have no sound in my right ear.  I don't know what happened.  What happened?  Maybe you got to jiggle your up.  I jiggled it.  You got to jiggle a little bit. 
[03:13:30]  A lot of jiggling in this studio.  Who makes the sound equipment in the United States?  I've never been in a studio where it actually worked.  I know, right?  They just never fucking work.  Ten-year-old Vietnamese girl.  Todd.  We may be wrong about the Nick DiPaolo thing.  What?  This says Dennis Falcone sent us here.  Oh, boy.  Dennis Falcone.  We got the...  Your last name was Falcone.  We'll go back to that extremely boring interview because now they finally had the big reveal  in their bid and they found the biggest dud at the radio station to really push it forward.  That's a wall of fucking yarn, huh? 
[03:14:00]  But first, we got what Nick DiPaolo requested.  Okay.  This J.J.  Walker cat.  Intro.  Monday with your brother, J.J. Walker.  See?  Yeah.  Locked and loaded with your total super assembly sounds non-stop.  When you're in the car, it's worse.  Oh, yeah.  Series XM.  It makes me jump.  He's too loud, Dennis.  Tell him.  Oh, there we go.  Nice.  This is why I'm listening. 
[03:14:30]  Saturday Night Fever.  I actually like the music.  Here's your happy day from here.  That's where you change it, though, right, Dennis?  What's that?  That's where you change it.  I'll go to the 60s and see what they're doing there.  They're not doing anything at any of these places.  Stop going there to see what they're doing.  They might be stretching out the weekend like I do on Sunday night.  She's got a great voice.  She's got a great voice.  I just got a joke that started the whole world crying.  But hi, Clancy. 
[03:15:00]  I just got to get a message to you.  Play more JJ.  Play more JJ.  You know, you could just go to a computer.  There's a bit going on here.  You could listen to all the voice tracks.  It's him singing the Bee Gees.  Yeah.  For once in my life, I'm alone.  But you'd rather hear the guy with the voice.  How can I lose a devil?  I have a way.  How many is left? 
[03:15:30]  One?  I think there's just a bee.  The guy with the big teeth?  One Bee Gees.  He's still around, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got one bee.  Barry Gibb.  The guy that was like the handsome Bee Gees, right?  He's the last of the Bee Gees.  We lost all the Gs.  And I think we're down to one bee.  No, we got one G left.  One G.  All the Bs are gone.  All the Bs are gone.  It was the Brothers Gibb.  The Brothers Gibb.  Now there's just a Gibb.  Gotcha.  Was Joe Gibb part of the company?  Joe Gibb? 
[03:16:00]  Is he one of the Coffees?  Is he one of the?  I'm not sure of you.  Sirius XM 70s on Sunday Monday.  Yeah.  With the Walker Child on Twitter now.  At JJ Walker 70.  It sounds fine.  Give me the B-boards.  Free my soul.  JJ, turn your shit down.  In Toronto.  Who grew up in Sudbury.  In Sudbury.  Yeah.  In Florida, but grew up in New York City.  New York group.  He's giving content.  He's giving content.  New York group.  Ace Frehley on 70s on 7. 
[03:16:30]  Wait, what did he do there, Dennis?  He was giving some content.  Oh, he was?  Yeah, and he's doing it too loud is the point.  What was the content?  I don't know.  Everybody was talking over it.  He was talking.  He was delivering content.  Dennis is very upset.  We're talking over the content.  It's all computerized.  Content.  There's no content.  He sits in his house and tapes that shit.  Yeah.  And then they punch a button, right?  And they send it out.  No, no, no.  It takes like 20 minutes.  He's actually in the studio?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  No, he's just.  I think this is.  Get the cats out of the bag now.  He's going to have to keep up this front. 
[03:17:00]  He's on 7.  Time tunnel.  Time tunnel.  Time tunnel.  1976.  J.J. Walker remembering the bicentennial year.  See?  From coast to coast, the United States celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of  Independence.  It's too loud.  It was also the year NASA released the famous face on Mars photo taken by Viking 1 and the  year the Scottish Bay City Rollers invaded North America.  75.  75.  476.  76.  And you liked that, Dennis.  Yeah.  It was great.  You hit the post and everything.  You did a little something.  Wait and see. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  There's ever since you met you got a hold on me.  S-A-T-U-R.  It's crazy, but it's crazy.  S-A-T-U-R.  T-U-R.  What do you mean he gave you something?  He gave you something.  Talked about 1976.  We do that laundry list then hoping that it might spark some comedy.  You know what else?  He just gave you a laundry list of shit that happened in 76.  Who cares?  Because he's on the 70s channel and he was playing a song from 76.  I know, but it comes up when the song plays.  Right.  And it tells you the year.  It comes up.  It takes all the guesswork out of it. 
[03:18:00]  Then you could just pick up your phone and go, 1976, you hit it, and you find out what  happened yourself.  So you don't really need a jock anymore because all that info is now on the radio.  I have another question about these channels, like the 80s and 70s.  How come on the 70s channel, it'll put the date of the song, but on, what is it, vinyl?  What's the other channel?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like a fucking classic rewind.  Classic vinyl.  Classic vinyl.  Why does it not put the date?  They might play the album version, too, of the song, too.  So where the 70s channel might be playing Do It Again by Steely Dan, play the 70s, the 
[03:18:30]  single version.  And nobody knows when the album's put out what year.  And we care why.  I liked it.  I do like a good date on there.  I do like a date of my songs.  I like knowing what year.  I do, too.  I can listen to that.  I go, I remember that.  But you don't need the jock giving you the year.  No.  If it says it on there, but sometimes if you have to hit the post.  1976, but classic vinyl doesn't tell you.  I don't like this.  If you've got music jocks, you should set them free and let them do their shit.  I love how excited Denny gets about a year being blurted out before the music starts. 
[03:19:00]  My point is, by the way, this was...  What was his name?  David Norton.  Yes.  He was in American Werewolf in London.  And he was the Dr. Pepper guy.  Yeah, what's his name?  Norton.  David Norton.  David Norton.  David Norton.  Yeah.  See, he added nothing there.  He was talking.  You guys talked all over.  A singer in a...  Well, I was trying to give some content.  I was talking about David Norton being the guy from American Werewolf in London and the  Dr. Pepper guy.  I'm a Pepper. 
[03:19:30]  You're a Pepper.  Remember him?  And he was the guy that's saying, taking it, I'm jacking it, grabbing my cock and whacking  it.  Werewolf in London.  What movie was the song in?  No more smacking it.  Wasn't he the Werewolf in London guy?  Very good.  Was he the Werewolf in London guy?  I can't even look at this.  Yes.  His story's infuriating.  Anyway, so you want J.J. to turn down his mic.  J.J., yeah, I listen to you all the time.  And now we go back to the horrible interview of the future as we feature the morning hot tub in  Fredericton, Canada.  Why are you guys... 
[03:20:00]  Why are you doing this?  If you don't like it, and you can do anything you want here, why are you doing this?  I need to hear more of this guy.  You're right.  I know Sam spent the month in the basement tracking this.  The question gets asked every Jocktober, no matter what it is, after the first two tracks.  I request no more fugitive.  Oh my God.  You're going to fuck up Jocktober.  I can't tell you what's going on out there.  I request no more fugitive.  Yeah, please.  There's another fugitive.  I mean, the amount of buzz...  I'm going to be a fugitive in three minutes. 
[03:20:30]  Now she's talking about the buzz.  Nothing to be shit.  Now she's talking about the buzz this contest.  The buzz.  Got going for Fredericton.  Are you happy with, I mean, the amount of buzz that you caused the city of Fredericton?  I mean, did you hear a lot of people chatting about it as you, you know, went on your day-to-day activities?  Oh, go on and check it, Buck.  Yeah, I sure did.  It seems like my plan worked perfectly, in fact.  But you're ready to give us back the $10,000.  I feel like I have no choice.  So you're at work.  And where do you work again?  At the Fredericton Chamber of Commerce.  So you're at work, and someone comes up to you and asks you, correct? 
[03:21:00]  I feel like I have no choice.  And so how did that all roll out?  Like, give me this scenario with me, like a picture.  Well, it was pretty late in the day, mid to late afternoon, and a lady came in and asked me some relevant work questions.  So I really had no idea at the time, and found out later that she was trying to build up the courage to ask me.  And then popped the big question.  Yeah, so she asked the question, precisely, are you the new hot $92,000, $10,000 fugitive the first time?  No, I'm not a fruit cup. 
[03:21:30]  Holy shit.  That guy hates the word crazy, too.  That is the dullest gentleman.  Unbelievable.  My liver shut down during that conversation.  If you're going to do the bit, why don't you get someone with fucking some energy?  Well, it's a work at Chamber of Commerce.  Is he on dialysis?  Is this what they want to give you?  More in Canadian.  The first time?  Yes, that's right.  That's something I put quite a bit of thought into in order to try to act natural when someone was asking it.  Act natural.  It's hard to do that when you're in a coma. 
[03:22:00]  Act naturally.  What?  Is that it?  Captain Charisma.  I thought he was still talking.  Wow.  Well, that's how the big contest ended.  That's it.  No, we got one more.  Oh, God damn it.  Fuck.  Did I piss you guys off last time I was here?  Maybe you could stick around on the after show with Sam.  Nick, I want to apologize.  Yes.  I will.  If Sam doesn't want me here, he's got his own thing.  Of course I want you here.  He'll love you here. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  And give me something to listen to on the way home.  What does that supposed to mean?  So this shit, I need to cleanse my palate with a little fucking Nick DiPaolo sorbet after this fucking horse shit.  I got some more, I got the outtakes to play on the after show today.  More fugitive clues.  Yeah, great.  That'll make Nick feel fantastic.  Hey, hit me up on Twitter.  I don't know why people say that, so fuck it.  You did it to us, though, man.  You got us annoyed on day one of Jocktober.  Day fucking one, Sam.  No more fugitives.  And he fooled me by being all excited about it. 
[03:23:00]  I thought we were going to get some, oh, guys, and hey, here's our phony phone call of the day, and like all that hacky good shit.  This bit would have been horrendous if it was done on a morning zoo show in Vegas.  Never mind Fredrickton fucking Fredrickton.  I'd rather watch a Time Warner commercial.  Ah, hey.  With Time Warner cable.  I'd rather watch a Lee and Morty commercial.  Yeah, exactly.  Morty, are you listening?  Look, the duster got the garbage.  All right, Lee.  I love that Lee.  That's what I want.  Geriatrics using a Swiffer. 
[03:23:30]  Right.  It's captivating.  I like when she goes, it's some type of mopping device.  Right.  Wow, great.  You hit the nail on the head.  The one I'm going to use when I cut your head off in the kitchen.  Yeah.  The one I'm going to fucking use to clean up after your cat eats your face when you drop dead on the floor and can't feed him.  Well, good news, guys.  The thrilling conclusion for the first day of Jocktober.  Here it is.  That's a part of this that I find fascinating is that you had to spend the better part of a month with this secret. 
[03:24:00]  And it was a secret from everybody.  Nobody in your life knew that you were the fugitive.  That's right.  How did you pull that off?  I'm excellent.  By being a dullard.  They just walk away from me when I try to talk.  I did actually find the key a couple days ago.  So as the fugitive, I used my ways to make sure she kept my secret.  Oh, shit.  Give me a scenario of what it was like to be out there and hear people talking about it or even just to be like in a store.  No, I was talking about it.  Did it put panic in you every time it got mentioned?  Yeah, actually.  I was very aware of it every time I was out in public. 
[03:24:30]  And obviously, you still have like a normal life.  You have a wife.  You've got a...  This is not real.  You just have a normal life to go through.  It's really, really real.  You would believe that he's walking around and people are talking about it.  And he's like, oh, boy.  They're into him like he's Bono, for Christ.  I heard people talking about it, but never actually heard anyone ask the question properly until it was sprung on me.  What, in French?  Part of my shock.  Did anyone ask the question wrong?  So did you, as a fugitive, look at anybody and turn anyone away?  Yeah, one lady would sign language.  I punched her in the face. 
[03:25:00]  I figured it out.  I expected it to be a great situation where someone was asking everyone they saw.  But she did.  What a dullard!  Holy fuck.  I'm so mad.  Thanks, Sam.  This wasn't what we were going for.  Thanks, Sam.  That's Jacktober.  Get that fucking...  He gave us some shit on it, right?  It worked.  Wow.  Fuck.  It's a bad radio show, isn't it?  Senate expected to reject House Bill.  This knows...  Oh, gee.  But he did provide you some quarter hours.  They worked together.  He really did.  Quarter hours.  Thank you, Denny. 
[03:25:30]  It's important to me.  We don't need quarter hours on this platform.  It's still good, right?  They subscribe.  It's done.  Thank God we had the Fez shit.  Oh, man.  So Jack told us we're still alive and well.  Yeah, I gave you a double dose today.  Right.  You certainly did.  Second half nod is good as the first half.  Two for Tuesday.  Thank you, Denny.  Yeah, I would have hate to have been here when you were talking about the Fez shit.  Something I could have really joined in on.  Yeah, exactly.  Poor Nick.  It's in here right when we stopped talking about interesting stuff.  I'm driving and going, I can't wait to get there.  Sorry.  This is a good show.  Oh, man.  It's a good show today.  It's everything I want to talk about.  It's been fucking great.  I like having great discussions with Nick about fucking everything that's going on, 
[03:26:00]  all this dumb shit going on in the news.  You were talking about it all the way here in the car.  I'm salivating.  Maybe you could sit in with...  Maybe you'd like to sit in with JJ on the 70s.  I would.  Jesus.  I listen to him.  There you go.  I fucking love the...  He's got a great voice.  I love satellite radio, dude.  You can't deny that.  Took me a while to get it.  I like that classic Rewind.  All that shit.  I mean, I'm a big fan of the classic Rewind.  I'm like, I remember getting chlamydia to this song.  Do you like the blues in the coffee house?  I hate coffee house.  I don't need that shit.  Coffee house.  Nothing ever could ever happen in a coffee house except for coffee. 
[03:26:30]  No.  All right.  You know what you have to check out?  Take a poetry and stick it up your ass.  You know what's great?  Escape.  You ever listen to Escape?  It's beautiful music, like the old beautiful music when you'd go to the dentist back in the  60s and 70s.  It's all the beautiful music.  Yeah.  No, I have that on around the clock.  It's great.  Yeah.  You mean the shit that fucking R.P.  McMurphy was listening to after they-  It's phenomenal.  After they lobotomized them.  This guy's coming over here.  Oh, you really like the beautiful music.  You're a company shit.  You're like Brent Musburger.  I just like all that stuff.  I like all the variety. 
[03:27:00]  This is beautiful music.  You're actually a nice-  Dennis is actually a-  We're such a-  A genuine nice guy.  A genuine nice guy.  And-  You know what's funny about being a company guy?  It's not getting him anywhere.  You would think the company would go, holy fuck, he really is a company guy.  Let's give him two shifts a weekend.  He is a prime example of what's not good about him.  That's why it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if you're a company guy.  They still shit on you.  How does that feel, Denny?  I'm still doing my job, no matter what they say.  He's got his hard drive of taboo pornography.  He's a professional.  The guy's old school. 
[03:27:30]  But he's so passionate about this place.  They should give him some more shit to do.  They should give him a show.  I come in here, and I got a job out of it a couple weeks ago, and I was on with Kevin  Pollack.  Oh.  Nice guy, Kevin.  They should give him a show called The Falcon Crest.  Right after that show, a gentleman emailed me and said, I'm having a housewarming party,  and invited me to bring the hard drive of hits.  Wow.  I was out there, and a big fan of you guys.  Loves you guys.  Wow.  Yeah.  Loves Jimmy, goes to see him in concert all the time.  And he DJs, too.  I do parties, private parties.  Who's a big fan of you guys?  Who is this guy that's a big fan? 
[03:28:00]  Steve Puma.  Nice guy.  Steve Puma.  Steve Puma.  Can I get his card?  Sounds like he can help me out.  He says he's worked with you in your other life when you were in the roofing business.  Who gives a shit stuff?  I was a tin knocker.  I wasn't a roofer.  Steve Puma.  Steve Puma likes you guys.  Steve Puma.  Is he a writer?  What's that?  No, he's a truck driver.  There's a guy that runs for the Mets.  He's from New York.  I covered the Mets in the day and his name was Puma, his last name.  Steve Puma, the truck driver.  The truck driver.  He's a big fan of the show.  And I used to work with him or something.  He knows you.  Sam was telling me that.  He didn't know me.  So he used to sell you parts or something. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, God.  He's still talking.  I don't know if this is going to be the Steve Puma story.  Very nice guy.  He's sending me some hospitality.  Oh, my God.  You're a brain tumor.  He had some nice Italian food.  Shut up.  He offered me.  Jesus.  I brought the hard drive of hits and I would talk up the songs.  Was I not providing enough heat in the room?  And there was a fellow there who was a big scandal.  Oh, my God.  Give me a fucking folder right now.  Is there an intern that wants to come in and maybe take a shot at radio while I'm here?  You motherless tit wonders.  Gentleman who's a big fan of the country music channels that we have here at Sirius. 
[03:29:00]  And he just loves stuff.  I think we're going to give Nick a make two.  We need a make good.  A make two.  Make good.  Make good.  We need a make good with Nick.  We're going to give the first official make good to Nick DiPaolo.  Nick, what is that?  Is that another Canadian stunt?  That means you get to come back.  You need to come back in.  Like tomorrow.  And fucking.  We're giving you a make good.  It's Nick DiPaolo week on the 430 movie.  Do you guys actually do that for people?  Never.  We've never done that.  I feel like we have to.  I feel like I have to.  I'll do it, but only if you guys switch to afternoons. 
[03:29:30]  We've got this morning shifts.  Getting up this morning.  I'm going to cry.  There's people around here that want us to do just that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, look at that.  We're getting a little heat.  What do you mean?  On the new Hot 92.3 Facebook page.  Oh, they're welcoming our fans.  Yeah, it says, welcome, O.B. Anthony fans, which is always.  O.B. Anthony channel, Hot 92.3.  And it says, hashtag Jocktober.  It says, the O.B. Anthony show in the U.S. has targeted the morning hot tub as part of their Jocktober show.  In this show, they attack morning shows and radio promotions. 
[03:30:00]  For our Fredericton friends, you will notice a lot of increased traffic on our page and comments you would not normally see.  To our American friends, welcome to our page.  And, yes, Canadians are this friendly.  Aw, that is friendly.  I do respect the shows that embrace Jocktober, so.  That exactly.  They acknowledge it.  They're nice people.  They really are nice, those goddamn Canadians.  They're nice.  This bit has taken.  A little bland, but so what?  Yeah.  The bit has taken the industry by storm. 
[03:30:30]  They're all very worried.  I got a call in October.  Don't you feel special to have been part of it?  Holy Jesus.  We got to make Nicky a song when he comes in.  Bring me back in August for that make-up date.  That's what Nicky wants.  Oh, Nicky, you're so fine.  Oh, Nicky.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Nicky.  Fuck.  I think we need a Nicky song when he walks in the studio.  Do we?  Oh, Nicky, you're so fine.  Oh, Nicky.  In the 80s.  How about you add the content now?  I had a hot girl put up in college.  I would sing that to Nicky.  Oh, really?  Oh.  You know, I didn't even get to tell you what celebrity is a fan of this show. 
[03:31:00]  He's still talking about Bob Puma or whatever that idiot's name is.  Steve Puma.  Nice man.  Steve Puma.  He wasn't an idiot.  He was a nice man.  I'm sure he's a listener of the show.  I love you guys.  That guy's named after a sneaker.  That's not how to treat a loyal listener.  You're right.  I'm sorry, Steve.  A P1.  I can't believe it.  I'm sure he's the last guy.  I had a friend, Eddie Adidas.  I knew him at Notre Dame.  How did that work out for you, Regis?  Kevin Combers.  Let me tell you.  He was holding out for more money.  Oops.  For what?  A better casket? 
[03:31:30]  Jesus Christ.  Right.  That guy's got a week left and he's still working.  At that point, just fucking take the gig.  Ladies and gentlemen, Susan Lucci.  Right.  How many times?  I love Susan Lucci.  Who doesn't love her?  Susan Lucci.  Fucking hot piece of age.  Then he shows the world that a guy with a lisp can do his job.  That's great.  Good for you, Regis.  Who's going to lisp?  Oh, Michael?  Yeah.  I'm not going to tell him that.  A big gap in his teeth and fucking...  Kelly Ripper.  Can't believe I'm replaced by a Negro! 
[03:32:00]  What happened?  Who likes our show, Sam?  This guy is the fucking Rich Little of Long Island.  We had him in last week.  Rich Little is in here.  Oh, did you wheel him in in a fucking...  I thought so, too.  He doesn't look bad at all, man.  He doesn't look bad, and he was actually...  He was only 73, I think.  Oh, my God.  I thought he was all...  You know what's fucked up about Rich Little?  He always looked old, because he was pretty young when all that shit was going down.  He was only in his 20s. 
[03:32:30]  He was in his 20s when he was in the fucking little suit at the roasts and stuff.  Yeah.  That, and he was doing buddy upsitting, and people who were in the 90s.  Yeah, exactly.  Charlie Weaver.  He actually...  I gotta say, he was fun.  He was a good time.  He did some impressions that...  He did all right.  Because he's older, his voice is more gravelly, so it sounded better.  Yeah.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Like, his fucking Reagan was right on the money, and his dumb Nixon.  He was still doing impressions from fucking 40 years ago, but, you know. 
[03:33:00]  I'll actually give you the punchline to his Nixon bit.  Oh.  What the fuck was it?  He's...  Her.  I'm no crook.  No.  I didn't do anything wrong, and I promise never to do it again.  Is that his joke?  Yeah, that's his thing.  That was throughout the 70s.  That's his...  I never did anything wrong.  I promise never to do it again.  He was on all those shows.  He was awesome.  The Bob Hope special.  Where the announcers used to yell, Bob Hope special, with the stars Charo, and Rich 
[03:33:30]  Little, Brooke Shields, and now, Bob Hope.  Said, like, J.J. Walker.  Hey, how are you?  That's wild, man.  It was the original J.J. Walker.  Hey, how about that, Brooke Shields?  Dana Gould used to do a great impression of Bob.  Yeah.  He's like...  I got an Angelian's tit in a jar on my counter.  Oh, shit.  When she had breads kicked.  Oh, my God.  I got an Angelian's tit in a while.  Hey, how about that Charo?  Let's get her in here with those big tits. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, it really makes me sad that my eyesight's going.  I can't see those nipples.  Danny's just too blue.  Oh, Danny.  Just sitting back and listening.  He loves it.  That is a fan of radio.  He is a fan of radio.  All types.  Of Rocktober.  Was Rich Little on that TV show, The Copycats, back in the 70s?  I think he was.  I think Frank Gorshin was on The Copycats.  Fred Travolina.  Fred Travolina.  Fred Travolina.  Marilyn Michaels.  Oh, my God.  You know them all.  Wow, you just added content.  I saw her at Westbury Music Fair with Milton Berle and Vinnie Olin. 
[03:34:30]  That was a great show.  The fuck year was that?  How was that?  It was a Sunday afternoon show.  What was it, a viewing?  And in the intermission, intermission, Milton Berle comes out on intermission.  He goes, come on, let's go.  Come on, let's cut this intermission short.  He goes, you know, I got dinner plans at 5 o'clock.  So he wanted to get everybody back into the show.  He was great, and he was awesome.  Fred Travolina.  Richard Lewis' best bit was, remember in the 80s, boxing referees were jumping in too  quick to stop fights.  Sometimes there was a period. 
[03:35:00]  He goes, I was watching the other night.  A guy's getting staggered.  The referee jumps in and goes, who's Fred Travolina?  He goes, I don't know.  It's over.  Who's Fred Travolina?  I don't know.  Fight's over.  Fred Travolina was the other comedian with the big jaw.  There was Jay Leno, and Fred Travolina had the big fucker.  Yeah, great impressionist.  What was his best impression?  Well, he would do...  And let's find it on YouTube.  Oh, my God.  His bit, I remember on Merv Griffin, he was doing The Godfather.  Oh, no.  And Fredo was being played by Paul Linn. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, Jesus, guys.  That sounds funny.  Sonny's in the business.  Michael's in the business.  Fredo, how come...  Oh, I don't know.  I guess I'm just different.  I gotta hear this now.  Oh, God.  He was great, Freddie Travolina.  No rich...  He was the poor man's rich little, kind of.  Yes.  You got that bit.  He was on The Tonight Show a lot.  Travolina, yes.  I don't know if I found that one.  Fred Travolina.  I gotta hear him do The Godfather thing. 
[03:36:00]  What happened to him?  Is he alive?  I'll tell you what happened.  He played the fugitive on a radio show.  Oh, boy.  And nobody found him ever.  You're not gonna let it go, are you?  There he is with Sammy on the telethon.  Oh, God.  I'm out to us.  The telethon.  Maybe his first Tonight Show appearance.  First?  All right.  Let's see that.  Yeah, that's fun.  Let's see that.  That's fun, right?  Wow, with Joey Bishop co-hosting.  He co-hosted.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  How about full screen?  Yeah, Sammy.  Sure. 
[03:36:30]  He's set with an edge.  Yeah.  I want to make a good impression, my friend.  Oh, no!  I thought I have got a sad confession, my friend.  He's singing.  I must admit.  Look at that hair do.  Take Helen Reddy's hair do.  Tonight.  He has a...  He has a...  I do impressions song.  All right.  He's great at pulling clips that make me look like an idiot.  Can you find him doing some impressions?  What the fuck?  Well, I'm sure he just does this song and then does some impressions. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, he's going to do the impressions any second now.  Here we go.  Do you have that kind of time?  Here we go.  I don't know how to...  Oh, my God.  That's the second verse.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine doing this?  It was a different time.  But it's happening, I swear.  Here we go.  My voice is changing.  And my hair is feeling blonder.  And my face is growing dimples.  Uh-oh.  Who is he?  Carol Channing?  Hi, everybody.  I'm Glenn King.  Oh.  And here's my song. 
[03:37:30]  I am a lightning for the county.  No.  This is one bad parent.  This is terrible.  Why are they applauding?  I do this song much better, by the way.  For another overload.  They're applauding for his hairdo.  I hear you singing in the wire.  Why is he doing this?  This is terrible.  Are you getting back at us, Nick, for Jacktober? 
[03:38:00]  This is what Nick wanted everybody to see.  You got a golden touch with that fucking...  You know, it was an editing program called Soundstage.  Wow.  That was...  Who's next?  Oh, cool.  You always like this?  Four to five something from 1980.  Johnny wouldn't have this on.  Very Vegas.  Very Vegas.  Oh, my God.  I never saw him sing an impression.  Look how long that clip was. 
[03:38:30]  Holy shit.  That was like 10 minutes.  I'd rather listen to fucking Jacktober.  Put him on the German news telephone.  All right, we got one.  Fred Travelina as Reagan, Nixon, Bush, and Elvis.  When I was over at Warner's, and they needed somebody to do a Bugs Bunny's voice.  You know something, Dutch?  When I was in China, the one thing that Mao Zedong has before was a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Uh, what's up, Doc?  Uh, kill the Wabbit.  Kill that Wascally Wabbit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:39:00]  What the fuck?  He's still here.  Why is he still here?  Who's that, Bush?  Hello.  Bush Senior.  All right, shut it off.  It's giving me a fake.  God damn it.  I'll go home and find Eclipse in a better than that.  I gotta say, amazing.  Wait a minute, you're a Fred Travelina fan yet.  You're actually turning the tables on me, you mother.  I'm gonna go home and watch the rest of his singing appearance on The Tonight Show.  I never saw him sing before he liked.  I never have either. 
[03:39:30]  But he was getting into it.  And he did fucking great impressions in the 80s when he was on Merv Griffin.  Late 70s.  Merv, yeah, yeah.  Late 70s.  We can't find Merv Griffin.  Where's Fred Travelina on Merv?  Yeah, just put Merv.  Nah, that's all right.  It's endorsed by Nick DePaul.  Maybe I was thinking of Rich Little.  And he Mervs.  Maybe I was thinking of Kevin Travelina.  I can't have to have to go with.  No Mervs.  He was always cracked up the cafeteria.  He sure was Mike Douglas.  Yo, Joe, motherfucker!  For you, Sammy, what?  Is he gonna stand in that spot?  Oh.  And we're gonna bring out a friend of his line.  Boy, they pushed him out of the chair, didn't they? 
[03:40:00]  Like he had MS himself.  Whatever the fuck he's...  Marvelous.  And we would like to bring him out.  All right, here it is.  Do something with Sammy.  I think he's gonna sing again, though.  I bet he's...  Jerry Lewis so full of himself.  He's doing Dean.  He's making fun of the kids.  He came in limping.  Yeah, limping out.  No, he came out of Sammy.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, man. 
[03:40:30]  You held that note longer than the Bank of America, man.  It's so good to see you.  How you doing, man?  Oh, I'm hanging in, babe.  Yes, you know, one of my favorite songs.  You should have come out in blackface.  You've been great.  Maybe a minute.  What's the matter, Nick?  Next time I come back for that payback, I'll bring the clips with me.  I'm telling you, this guy has some talent.  You're right.  He had 11 tough appearances, and you found them all.  They're all in a row, yeah.  It's a weird hour.  It's a great hour. 
[03:41:00]  I love to do this.  Oh, my God.  You guys cover a lot of ground here.  Yeah, we kind of do.  None of it good.  Yeah.  Dennis, always a pleasure.  Whatever.  Yes, Dennis Falcone.  I'm glad you popped in, Dennis.  I was on, but now I'm gone.  Huh?  I was on, but now I'm gone.  Oh, that's...  It's lines like that will keep you in the fucking mop room, all right?  Now, listen.  The mop room.  Nick, you're always a pleasure.  Oh, shit.  Dennis is a true bro, man.  He is.  He's a professional.  Seasoned.  Doesn't matter what. 
[03:41:30]  No matter what.  Oh, I got one of these.  And have some fucking ziti, will you?  Yeah, go fucking bulk up a little.  You make me feel bad.  A little too light right now.  A little too light.  Yeah, for an Italian.  Eat something, for God's sake.  A little too light.  You don't eat.  You got it?  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  Awkward equity.  That was an awkward exit.  Heard his feelings?  That he just took.  Now, he's...  See him crying outside the window?  Skulks back down the hallway with a shitty part of his job.  No, nothing changes the guy. 
[03:42:00]  This is like a little peace and quiet, a refuge, a sanctuary from a cubicle he's got to sit  in and paw through 60s music and pick out what he thinks is good and what isn't, and  it doesn't make a fucking difference.  It's all old shit.  But haven't they already figured out what we want to hear from the 60s?  That's why I don't understand those jobs.  Should I play Cherish by the association, or should I go with the turtles?  No, it's all about what you play after the turtles.  Like, people care.  Yeah, yeah.  Should we go with the...  It's the word I used to describe. 
[03:42:30]  You know what he's working on now?  What?  The Christmas channel.  He said he's in meetings and programming the Christmas channel.  What do you mean meetings?  Just play the same thing.  That's another thing.  You think Jingle Bell Rock will make it?  Well, I'm sure there's a black version of something.  Yeah, they probably want to put that in.  But it's Christmas music.  We already decided what songs we like hearing around Christmas.  Put the same station that was on last Christmas on this Christmas.  If you put the exact same playlist from last Christmas...  Nobody's going to know.  ...and the Christmas before and before and before... 
[03:43:00]  With the exact same intros by the music jocks, no one would notice.  No one would know.  But they're wasting time on meetings for that?  Oh, every week.  That's true.  But I love that Dennis is...  You've got to love a guy like that.  He loves radio.  He loves it.  He's obsessed with it.  We're successful because we hate radio.  No, you're right.  I'm serious.  No, you're right.  There's two...  Oh, there are.  I'm totally serious.  You've got to be at the extremes of both ends.  If you're in the middle, you just...  Yeah, you're fucked.  That's a good point.  Yeah.  Early on, I was lucky to figure out that all that was bullshit. 
[03:43:30]  I was lucky to learn that lesson early on.  Yeah.  Oh, being a cop.  And radio was bullshit.  All that stuff he likes to fucking talk about.  It doesn't really make much of a difference.  No one gave a shit what your voice sounded like.  That one really hit a nerve with him.  Well, because I tried.  That's why.  When I was in college, I went for the radio voice.  I'm like, I don't have a radio voice.  What the fuck am I doing?  You know who Denny is?  Who?  What was that movie fucking... 
[03:44:00]  Forrest Gump?  Yeah.  What's his name?  Jack Nicholson, retiring.  Oh, yeah.  About Schmidt.  About Schmidt.  About Schmidt.  He's like, about Schmidt.  How the fuck did you remember that?  No.  That movie was great.  It's one of our go-to movies, because I think it's one of the funniest movies ever made.  When he tries to tell the young...  It's hilarious.  ...the young kid about the business, and, hey, I got all the stuff I've worked on my entire  career here, so you can research it and learn about the business.  And then he goes out, and it's in the fucking dumpster.  His entire career is in a dumpster.  All that shit's in the dumpster. 
[03:44:30]  This might be the wrong movie.  Does he get in a hot tub with Kathy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you get to see her titties.  Yeah, yeah.  The big, saggy titties.  I had to go to Psycho.  That was the one.  I had to see his shrink for like two months after I saw that movie.  Yeah.  Dude, that movie is hilarious.  It's just one bad thing after another.  About Schmidt.  He goes back to his old childhood home, because he wants to feel nostalgic, and it's gone.  A tire store was built.  He's trying to explain that the tire display is where his fucking bed used to be.  The bedroom was, and oh, it's the saddest, most pathetic fucking movie.  But they just go so over the top, I just started laughing at how ridiculous this guy's life is. 
[03:45:00]  And he's just got to tell his loved ones not to vacuum while he's out of the house.  Oh, God.  Yeah, the fucking wife.  And that's exactly how you'd find the old fucking dead wife.  With the shoe half off her foot, and the vacuum still running.  I forgot about that.  Remember that?  And she dropped dead fucking vacuuming.  Right.  And she's just laying there with the shoe.  Just doing some mundane task around the house.  And he's just sitting there living his whole life.  Dear Ndugu.  Oh, God, it was so sad.  His whole life is his adopted kid, Sally Struthers. 
[03:45:30]  RV.  RV, right?  Because he's going to see his daughter, who hates her.  I've got to go read.  Daughter hates her.  I can revisit that.  Oh, it's the best movie.  Back in October, I'll get right on it.  Back in October, right, right, The Fugitive.  But the scene with all this shit in the dumpster.  In the dumpster was...  The new guy doesn't want to hear nothing.  But that's Denny.  He would be like, hey, let me show you the ropes.  I got my notebooks here and my clipboard and everything that I've learned.  And then Sal comes in and says, go fuck yourself.  Sal's like, just put it in the dumpster, you fucking old fossil.  But how bad do you want...  You guys got this like it was fucking Goodfellas. 
[03:46:00]  But how bad do you want to see his clipboard in the dumpster?  Oh, God, with him along with it.  With a Sirius XM fucking bumper sticker on it.  His dismembered torso.  Right.  With just his shoe sticking out of the dumpster.  Oh, Jesus.  I would love that.  Fucking Denny.  What?  Oh, sorry.  Good soldier that gives him nothing.  That is sad.  It just proves that fucking all that hard work and kissing ass and being a company guy gets  your shit on.  Because we also did that, Nick.  We were company guys.  And it got us nowhere.  Every chance... 
[03:46:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  At AAF, you mean?  A long time ago.  At AAF?  A long time ago, yes.  I had a feeling I was listening to you guys and even know I was listening to you guys.  Wow.  When you were at AAF?  AAF, we were 95 to 98.  Oh, no.  And then the first part of our New York careers, we were company guys as well.  And it got you nowhere.  Every chance they got, they screwed you over.  So how do you go against the grain and not get into trouble?  Oh, me and I have had the conversation on the way home.  We had the conversation on the way home.  We came to New York and nothing...  It wasn't working because we were listening to them.  I swear to you.  Remember who your first guest was? 
[03:47:00]  Comedian?  Oh, God.  You.  Nick DiPaolo.  That's right.  It was fucking Nick.  I wish I took that more serious than I've heard.  Nick was our first comic in New York.  I do remember that.  And you were an L.A. guy at the time.  Literally, you were here a week.  Right.  And I'm like, fuck.  Fuck.  Nobody knows Emin.  Nobody knows me.  That's amazing.  Right.  Cut to eight minutes later once again.  Another bridge burn.  What happened was...  Fucking hit on my career like a real mommaloo. 
[03:47:30]  What happened was, like, we were there at least...  How many months?  Three or four months, probably?  Yeah.  And they needed results right away.  We weren't getting any heat.  Because the station was hurt.  We had no heat.  So you took a shit in a church or something?  What did you do?  That came a little later.  We were driving home and I'm looking in.  I'm like, this ain't working, man.  Because we've got to do something.  And we've got to do something.  And we just decided we can't listen to anything they're saying.  Like, let's not listen to...  We have nothing to lose.  We're not going to play that horse shit music anymore.  If we have to, we're going to fucking goof on it and just be ourselves. 
[03:48:00]  Be ourselves was the key.  And we went in the next day and people were like, what the...  It's always the key.  What the fuck?  It really is.  And then we all of a sudden saw a bump in the ratings and then the rest is history.  But we were just about done in New York.  We were in trouble.  We were talking to each other.  How many months in?  How many years in?  They don't give you time at all.  You know.  Three months.  You know the bullshit.  How many buyers should give you a ratings book?  I said a year early.  I think I was on for five and a half months.  Yeah.  I've said it to Nick over the years.  This guy belongs on radio, but they don't get it.  So we were running out of time. 
[03:48:30]  I think we might have had three months left.  We were talking.  I remember we were saying like, look, we could fucking go out in a fizzle by doing what they  want, playing the music, taking these short breaks that they want us to take, or we can  fucking do whatever the fuck we want to do, whatever we think is fun and funny and shit  like that.  Because we made it work in Boston.  And then they could fire us because we fucking aren't listening to them, but at least we're  not going to fizzle out like, you know, oh, well, another radio team that couldn't make  it in New York.  And that was it.  Everything that worked in Boston, we decided when we got to New York to ignore. 
[03:49:00]  That changed fucking overnight.  It was amazing.  I mean, we got hired by a legendary radio station.  We were like, holy fuck.  So we were in a-  We were blowing off music and then doing longer fucking talk breaks and just fucking not paying  attention to the playlist.  Breaking CDs because we're like, fuck this.  We're not playing this shit anymore.  It's like Rod Stewart.  There you go.  Yeah.  If you want my body in, do you think I'm sexy?  And we're like, no, we're not playing that.  We started yelling at everybody, the PD, the GM. 
[03:49:30]  The GM would come in with a bat, an actual bat.  That's right.  Saying how ridiculous it is because we spent-  Who was that GM?  I would love to find the-  At that point, it was Scott Herman from upstairs.  All we had to do one day was play Rod Stewart, Do You Think I'm Sexy, for this dumb fucking  promotion they were doing.  And me and Ant decided, we're not fucking doing it.  And so we spent 10 minutes trying to decide who would be the pussy that would fucking push  the button to start the dumb song.  Yeah.  I'm not pushing it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we tried to get the cleaning lady involved. 
[03:50:00]  Maybe she'll push it.  And then the general manager came down with a bat, like, what the fuck are you guys doing?  I'm like, then you fucking push the button.  We're not pushing it.  With a bat?  Yeah.  Seriously?  Yeah.  The fucked up thing was he left the bat in the studio.  Oh.  And then we wound up playing baseball with the CDs we didn't want to play.  We destroyed this.  We destroyed this.  Say that?  We destroyed this.  Here's the pitch.  You remember what we destroyed?  Which pissed off a lot of people.  What?  But we had to go with an artist that would piss off people to get them talking.  Was it Bruce?  Bruce Springsteen.  We had destroyed his entire fucking catalog one day. 
[03:50:30]  They had to go out and buy some more Bruce.  The entire catalog, one after another, we would pitch to each other and we would just  smash the CDs.  That was what we did one afternoon.  You know, not fucking, you know, wow, we're setting the world on fire.  Oh, I know.  But it sure as shit wasn't.  Oh, but for that.  And the next song.  But for that radio station, it was over the top ridiculous.  How many songs did you have to play an hour?  Oh, my God.  They had us playing probably 12.  Yeah.  And then you have to squeeze in the commercials.  So it gave us maybe seven minutes, an hour or something like that. 
[03:51:00]  Seven minutes, an hour to talk and try to like, and then we just started blowing them  off.  So fuck it.  Fuck this.  And you got a bump in the radio.  Yeah.  And then they were like, all right.  There's a lesson for you, kids.  A little bump.  A little bump.  And then we're like, okay, okay, this is working.  And then they were a little happier because like, wait a minute.  Yeah.  But there, we were lucky though, because the station was so desperate.  They allowed us to be just dicks.  Yeah.  If it was an established station and we were doing that, we would have been fucked.  But we knew we sort of weren't fucked that we could take those chances. 
[03:51:30]  If that makes sense.  Yeah, it kind of.  Makes a lot of sense.  Yeah.  Very smart.  Glad you had that conversation.  And look where we are now, people.  We were on the way home.  Fucking Jocktober.  We were on the way home to our personal lives and that wasn't really anything great.  Mine was a great going home to the ex-wife.  So we're sitting there like depressed.  Pleasure that was.  We were kicking ass in Boston and now we, but we might be out of fucking radio now.  How does this happen?  Opie was my on-air partner and fucking, the good Captain Morgan was my off-air partner.  Oh yeah? 
[03:52:00]  Deal with that fucking ex-wife.  Oh, her with her fucking divorce lawyer, Dominic Barbara.  Ha ha, Dominic.  What happened?  He got fucking arrested the other day.  Well, yeah.  Two days ago.  Choking a bitch.  He was fucking choking a bitch.  Allegedly.  Huh?  That's what he was arrested for.  Yeah.  That's what he was arrested for.  Yeah.  And the girl he was with, she was arrested too because she drove to the precinct to like  report him drunk off her ass.  So they arrested her for D-Week. 
[03:52:30]  What should she?  He's hanging out with great company.  That's the guy.  Yeah.  He came to my show down at like Sag Harbor.  How long ago?  Oh, this is five years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  When he was still, when he still had the facade up.  He still had the fucking fake.  Look at what he looks like.  That's him real.  That's the real Dominic right there.  Crazy eyes.  He's crazy.  He's fucking.  Crazy eyes.  Nassau's finest with the mustache is hauling him in.  Nah.  Good.  Fuck you.  What does he look like?  He does look like someone, like a fucking mafioso that they're bringing in. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, he does.  He looks like a fucking banana.  He's fucking the chin.  He's Vincent the chin.  Those guys didn't play.  Gigantic.  Looks like Martin Mull after a bender.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  That fucking prick.  I gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars.  That's my worst.  In legal fees.  I think I'd have to whack the wife.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that never crossed your mind.  Yeah.  I never thought about killing my ex-wife. 
[03:53:30]  Holy shit.  No, no, no.  What a great setup.  Because here comes the butt part.  I never thought about killing my ex-wife.  You know, that's the next word.  Butt.  There it is.  The thought of a horrid, maybe, accident happening.  A real accident or a fake accident?  No, a real accident.  Oh, okay.  A real accident.  Like if she was driving and something happened.  Or fucking something fell on her head.  Or if a bolt of lightning were to strike her.  Will they bring you back your money? 
[03:54:00]  I wouldn't have been all that upset about it.  Put it that way.  I mean.  It's one of those things where that divorce was so evil.  Yeah.  It was the darkest, doomiest, gloomiest fucking part of my life.  And to have that fat fuck lawyer staring at me every time in court.  How'd she afford him?  He's a pretty high profile.  Because I paid for it.  He had to pay her fees.  I had to get the shitty lawyer.  Because she got the good lawyer. 
[03:54:30]  And I had to pay him to fuck me in the ass.  Yeah, sorry.  It infuriates me to this day.  The laws seem a little fucking twisted.  You think?  A little lopsided?  It was insane.  But they want equal rights everywhere else?  And then he kept.  How does that make sense?  He kept postponing and postponing and postponing and postponing.  Because they wanted me to sign my new deal.  So he could go, look at all the money.  And now she gets there.  Look at all the money he makes.  His future earning potential.  In radio, your future earning potential could be zero. 
[03:55:00]  If you say, you know, have sex in a church.  This could be our last show.  We don't know.  I don't think so.  I think we're all right.  Yeah, the Rocktober thing.  The Rocktober thing.  Put us over the top.  The Rocktober.  We're good for a fucking summer.  Oh, Rocktober.  Some are saying that you all awesome make good for the Fred Travelini stuff.  Is it a wash here?  What the fuck happened?  You find out how to pull those clips.  Trust me.  This guy's a genius at making people look like a doofus.  I saw Travelini 80 times.  Brilliant.  He's a punchline in a Richard Lewis joke.  So he was famous. 
[03:55:30]  I mean, he was a punchline.  Good singer, too.  You saw him, Anthony.  Of course.  Come on, he did a great impression.  When did he go away?  Did he die?  Oh, yeah.  He died.  He died a few years ago.  Oh, he did.  Oh, yeah.  Fred, he's gone.  All those people that we...  You notice?  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Travelini wasn't that old.  I mean, like Don Meredith and Tom Brookshire and Pat Summerall's gone.  Art Donovan.  Art Donovan just died.  Yeah.  He was hilarious.  I know.  Letterman, obviously.  I know.  A lot of people remember him from Letterman.  I'd ask him to pull a clip of it, but Jesus Christ.  Maybe Donovan taking a dump or something. 
[03:56:00]  We felt so guilty, we stayed late, Nick.  See?  No, I know.  And you didn't have to do that, guys.  No, we kind of...  You did.  You did not.  We were kind of agreeing with you.  Come on.  We run out of here at 10 for the most part.  I know you do.  Although...  Amazing.  Go, go, go.  No.  We didn't give you the best material, but the jokes were still there.  Yeah, you did.  The jokes were still there.  I don't care what you're talking about.  The jokes were still there.  This is my way of playing.  I mean...  We got Nick DiPaolo on.  That was my angle.  You fucked me.  Hey, don't worry about it.  Come on.  I'm in radio.  I have a podcast coming out.  Exactly.  Middle of October.  Can't wait for that.  Which is very exciting. 
[03:56:30]  Nick DiPaolo's podcast, I'm telling you right now, is going to be really good.  I'd like to do it someday, Nick.  It's going to be really good.  I would like to do your podcast at some point.  Are you kidding me?  You want to do the first one with me?  He was really good on the radio, and I'm telling you, it's going to do very well.  It'll be fun.  I'll be uncensored.  It's nickdip.com for a lot of your shit.  Nick DiPaolo on Twitter.  Yep.  Every Wednesday at Caroline's in the month of October, Nick's going to be doing a 9 o'clock  show.  That's huge.  And then he's got other dates.  I'm going to go Wednesday.  Bananas Comedy Club, Poughkeepsie, New York, October 5th.  That's just Saturday night.  Oh, yeah.  That's right around the corner, duh.  And the following Saturday in Cincinnati, Ohio, the ballroom. 
[03:57:00]  At the Tap Theater.  October 19th.  And then Helium in Buffalo.  I think they'll come out in Buffalo to see Nick DiPaolo.  I do.  I do good in Buffalo.  I could vouch for that area.  They love you up there.  Yeah.  I always sold tickets up there.  That's October 31st.  Halloween?  Is it?  Oh, I can't be playing on Halloween.  Is that a Halloween thing?  Yeah.  How am I going to poison the kids in Westchester?  So you're going to have to be dealing with a lot of costumes.  Oh, great.  At your show. 
[03:57:30]  I'm having a Halloween party this year, too.  So everybody might want to.  I'll let you know what the date is and everything.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  What day is Halloween?  Aren't you too old for a Halloween party?  No.  That's a good holiday.  It's just a good excuse.  To see the girls all slutting.  What day is Halloween on this year?  I think it's like a Thursday?  Yeah, it's a thirsty Thursday.  All right.  So then, should I have it the weekend?  Well, the weekend before is way too early.  So why don't you just do?  Nobody dresses up two days after Halloween.  Yeah, what if we take the show off on Friday and do it Halloween night?  Yeah.  Because other people have real jobs. 
[03:58:00]  I picked that one.  Oh.  You got to go Friday, yeah.  1985, me and my roommate picked up two girls that would dress like pandas.  Wow.  At a nightclub.  They looked adorable.  And then, fuck, I woke up the next morning.  All the makeup was off.  Oh, my God.  It was about four and a half.  I was trying to put her ears back on.  That panda makeup's adorable.  Holy shit.  You know, once it comes off.  I went to bed with a cute little bear and woke up with a fucking wolverine.  Yo, motherfucker.  You got to do it Friday. 
[03:58:30]  Friday's the day?  Because Halloween's on a Thursday, people will chill and wait for Friday for the big party.  And it's Friday.  I'll be in Buffalo.  Friday.  God damn it.  I haven't seen that castle he goes.  I know.  You got to come by, man.  You can fly back.  Oh, the whole weekend you're going to be out there.  Send that helicopter remote control thing up to Helium.  I'll send it up to Helium.  I'll grab the back of my shirt.  Lift you up.  Take you there.  Bring me home.  My fucking drone.  All right, Nick.  All right.  Thank you, fellas.  What a blast.  Seriously.  I got to get my kids to school, so I got to get out of here.  See that?  You're dead.  I got to tell everybody that if you worry about missing your favorite TV shows because 
[03:59:00]  your DVR is full.  Oh!  Oh, don't worry about it.  Luckily, you can get the Hopper from Dish with enough DVR storage to record and save all  your favorites.  The Hopper.

Nick, thank you so much.  Fellas.  Always a pleasure.  Yes.  Like having Nick in.  Thank you so much.  Troy Kwan, thanks for stopping in and saying a few words.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It was the first time Troy's spoken on the air in quite a while.  Yep.  Back in, what was that, the 9 o'clock hour.  We were able to save one of our guys.  He was so fired.  He was so fired.  What'd you do? 
[04:00:00]  So fired.  He was yelling gay shit.  He was yelling, screaming at another employee, speculating as to his sexuality, and using  all the righteous words.  Our argument is, obviously, he wouldn't yell that shit or think that way outside the studio.  If it's on air, who cares?  If you sit down in the hallway, he's my hero.  I was going to say, I thought it was the other way around.  Yeah, exactly.  What really got him in trouble was he called the guy crazy. 
[04:00:30]  Well, that's true, crazy or insane.  A crazy gay guy.  I actually thought he was gone.  I thought we were fucked on that one.  But what came down was, all right, he could have a job.  He got suspended.  But then when he came back, it was like, here's the ruling now.  He is not to speak on air until further notice.  Which sucks, because he did really good stuff for us.  We like having Troy on, and he did some fun stuff.  And who's going to be the guy that says, OK, further notice is over?  I know, because they ain't going to want to.  Because then they have to vouch for him if he does fuck up.  So obviously, he'll never be able to talk on our show again. 
[04:01:00]  Maybe Tim could figure it out, though.  He's taking a vow of silence like a monk.  Who's the fucking GM, Adam Lambert?  Listen.  Listen.  But Greenstein did the right thing on this one.  He helped us save Troy.  All right, Sam's going to do a little after show before.  It'll be four minutes long today, about.  All right.  Really?  With spots.  I cut into your time and makes up for those shitty clips.  You didn't take a break. 
[04:01:30]  How many breaks did we do today?  Two.  That's it?  You didn't take the break at nine.  You started Jacktober and ran through.  Holy fuck.  I loved it.  What are you guys, nuts?  I know, we're crazy like that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  With the end one.  Thank God it was all quality entertainment.  Same show where we had to be on the clock and do one minute at a time in between records.  Great from Hawaii, from the Shirley area.  And now Topo Gigi.  You fucking puppet.  You. 
[04:02:00]  Jose Jimenez.  Did you hear Jackie Mason was there when Jackie Mason got in trouble on the Ed Sullivan show?  John Beiner was outside.  John Beiner was there?  Beiner heard Ed Sullivan yelling at him.  Oh, man.  No, no.  That's great.  He's standing outside the green room, you hear Ed Sullivan, you're a little juke, hocksucker.  You never recognize Chad again, you.  He was really on the other.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Of course, Beiner does the best Ed Sullivan you've ever heard.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Is he alive?  Beiner?  John's still with us.  I don't know.  Yeah, he's still there. 
[04:02:30]  God, was he fucking funny.  All like an odd couple.  Yeah, yes.  Played the guy in the garage at the odd couple.  That's who we watched.  Yeah, on the odd couple, he was brilliant.  Unbelievable.  All right.  John Beiner.  Now I'm featuring you guys.  Uh-oh, now look.  Hey, we got John Beiner.  He's turning on some John.  Boy, you really got this rock and roll thing off the ground.  Come back on our show.  Some mannerisms.  Here he's going to sing a little song about it.  Well, I'll let him tell you about it.  Elvis.  Why is he always singing in French? 
[04:03:00]  Hold it, boys.  Hold it, boys.  Hold it, boys.  Hold it, boys.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for that warm reception you gave to me.  Oh, my God.  A singer from America.  I'd also like to say that before you newcomers come up here, you don't have to...  He did it again to me.  He did it again!  He did it again!  Sam is comedy kryptonite.  Holy shit!  The great Nick DiPaolo.  Love you, miss you, buddy. 
[04:03:30]  See you later.  Love you, miss you.  Thanks so much, man.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  There may be no government, but we still have a clock to attend to.  We got about five minutes, so let's make this after show count.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[04:04:00]  Open phones for the next five minutes or so here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  First day of Jocktober.  And I got to say, Sal called it.  Saul called it.  Better call Saul.  Sal called it.  He said that they would not get through today's Jocktober before realizing how sick they were of Jocktober.  You called it, dude.  They are.  Yeah, I mean.  They're sick of it, but that's, I mean, there's no way.  There's no way. 
[04:04:30]  And I don't care what Opie says in here.  There's no way I'm doing my job if I am to be monitoring the stations across this country.  And there's a fugitive out there, and he's not going to be highlighted on Jocktober.  It's not going to happen.  516, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, what's up?  This is a fugitive.  And I don't care what Opie says in here.  There's no way I'm doing my job if I am to be monitoring the stations across this country. 
[04:05:00]  And there's a fugitive out there, and he's not going to be highlighted on Jocktober.  It's not going to happen.  516, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, what's up?  This is a fugitive.  I just wanted to say slobo.  Okay.  Fugitive, do you have anything?  Have you stoned?  No?  Okay, so clue number one for the After O&A Live fugitive is slobo.  So I don't know if you want to ask around, just make sure you ask properly.  How great was that?  I don't know if you could hear it because they were kind of talking over it. 
[04:05:30]  That boring, horrible fugitive interview that happened after they read all the clues when they were like, oh, did anybody come up to you and ask you improperly?  And he goes, no.  No, nobody really came up to me at all.  That was terrible.  Because it's in the rules of the game.  You have to ask him a certain way.  It's just so, the fugitive is easily the worst bit that's ever happened in radio.  It's a crying shame.  210, you're on the air.  You there, 210?  All right, I'm going to go to Dave in Tennessee then.  I feel like Art Bell just going unscreened. 
[04:06:00]  What's up, Dave?  They're tired of it.  You fucked up today, buddy.  I'm sorry.  Dude.  You fucked up.  You picked the fugitive.  You can't come out the gate with a fugitive.  I'm going to tell you the way this thing works.  No matter what order you put the fugitive in, they're going to be unhappy.  Tomorrow, I'm going to come out with some kind of hacky show, and either they'll be happy or they'll remember that every show sounds exactly the same, and they're all equally infuriating.  Part of the joy of Jocktober is the unpleasantness that it brings our ears. 
[04:06:30]  You know what I mean?  He's not there anymore.  Let's go to 210.  What's up?  Hey, it's Lady Trucker, Sam.  How are you doing, Lady Trucker?  I'm doing fine.  I just – I have a feeling you're going to do 30 days of fugitives.  Let me tell you something, Lady Trucker.  People can say whatever they want.  If I could find 30 fugitives out there in the continent of North America, we would do 30 days of fugitive audio.  I'm in charge of Jocktober, and I can't get enough fugitive. 
[04:07:00]  I love when I find out that another station is doing the fugitive bit.  I love looking at Opie and Anthony's faces when they're sitting there bewildered that we're doing this again.  I love all that.  Every bit of the fugitive, to me, is beauty.  Let's go to 318.  You're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man, I'm really hoping that this Jocktober bit, like, ends today.  You hated it, huh? 
[04:07:30]  Oh, my God, man.  This is, like, one of Opie and Anthony's worst shows ever.  I got to say, I think today – you look at – I disagree.  The first hour was great.  Today in the first hour, we did the motorcycle gang thing and the government shutdown.  That was both great.  Talking about Fez and going crazy, that was awesome.  Mike Francesa, awesome.  Nick DiPaolo coming in.  He was great.  Jocktober, give or take.  And the last half hour, any time Opie and Anthony go long, it's always good because they end up saying some crazy shit, 
[04:08:00]  like Anthony bringing up whether or not he ever thought about killing his ex-wife.  I say this goes down as one of the better shows in a long time.  Okay, Sammy.  You convince me.  All right, buddy.  Listen, Jocktober, part of the fugitive that makes it so exhausting is there's about 15 audio clips that goes,  with it, that go with it.  The next show will probably have five or six clips.  It'll probably be a little easier to digest.  But I feel – this is the type of person I am, though.  There's no dipping your toe into Jocktober. 
[04:08:30]  You dive in first into the deep end.  You can enjoy the hot tub maybe midway through the month.  But it's an icy cold pool, and we are diving in headfirst.  Andrew in Long Island.  Hey, Oktoberfest jumped the shark.  Well, at least they took it with a good sense of humor.  They did take it with a good sense of humor, and it's not even come close.  Jocktober can't jump the shark.  First of all, you called it Oktoberfest.  And second of all, it's a celebration of bad radio.  It's going to sound bad.  Ron and Fez are coming up next. 
[04:09:00]  This has been a wonderful afternoon. </pre>
