<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, fictional dramatic reading about a rage-inducing virus, followed by a rapid recap of the Detroit Tigers' World Series victory over the New York Mets, focusing on Carlos Beltran's crucial at-bat.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Bob Kelly (filling in for Jim Norton), then discussed listener calls about relationship conflicts stemming from dreams of infidelity. This led to a segment on the "Opie Curse," mocking Opie's consistently wrong sports predictions, particularly regarding the Buffalo Bills and Mets.  The hosts also made offensive jokes about Missouri and its inhabitants, briefly mentioning a documentary, "The Bridge," about suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge, and previewed an upcoming segment with the director and a survivor.  They promoted their "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest for the heaviest woman to appear on the show.

The show continued with a discussion of humorous and shocking YouTube videos submitted by listeners and staff, including footage of Bob Kelly vomiting, a woman with a hernia, and a staged video depicting racial violence.  They discussed "The Bridge" documentary, its controversial filming methods, and the subsequent call-in from the director, Eric Steele.  This was followed by a detailed and offensive discussion of the Mark Foley scandal, including a priest's admission of past sexual contact with a teenage Foley,  a preview of a "Tourette's Day" segment, and mentions of upcoming guests, including a Golden Gate Bridge suicide survivor.  Jeffrey Ross was a guest in the studio.

Eric Steele’s interview detailed the filming of "The Bridge," including permit acquisition, observing jumpers, and interventions that saved six lives. He discussed the challenges of identifying potential jumpers, body recovery, and the emotional toll.  Kevin, a suicide survivor featured in the film, called in, describing his experience with bipolar disorder, the suicide attempt, the impact with the water, and his ongoing recovery.  Jeffrey Ross participated in studio banter, football picks, and jokes relating to the suicide discussion.  A humorous exchange involved a listener’s Howard Stern t-shirt.

The broadcast shifted to a caller, Mike, recounting his near-drowning experience. This transitioned to a comedic discussion of Bob Kelly's past suicide attempt, followed by listener calls, a gorilla-suit kidnapping attempt, and Wesley Snipes' tax evasion.  Jeffrey Ross recounted his experiences on a USO tour, contrasting them with Jim Norton's routine.  The hosts complained about San Francisco's censorship.  Krista, a plus-size model from their commercials, joined the show, engaging in prolonged, vulgar banter with the hosts and Ross about her weight, appearance, dating life, and the challenges of plus-size modeling. This included visual gags involving Krista lifting her shirt.

A segment featured a game to reveal which male staff members, including "Nosferatu," harbored a crush on Krista.  Roland, a staff member, was repeatedly mocked for his awkwardness and lack of movie knowledge.  The conversation included sexually suggestive comments about Krista. Mike Tyson then joined as a guest, discussing his past, racism, and other topics in a rambling and often offensive manner.

A chaotic visit from a stand-up comedian, "Mr. Will," ensued, with his set including jokes about his grandmother's death and poor hygiene.  Jeffrey Ross was present, briefly participating and offering a "Line of the Day" entry.  The "Line of the Day" segment, sponsored by Bodogfight.com, was featured.  Krista was again in the studio, with jokes about her appearance and attraction to her. The show concluded with thank yous to the staff, further ribbing of Krista, and mentions of upcoming appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  This is different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish the God they weren't a deserve one. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pussules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We need to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go. 
[00:01:00]  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Come on, everybody.  Wake up.  Rise and shine.  Up. 
[00:01:30]  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Where is Hakeem?  Take me.  What was that?  Remember that one?  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, but it's under my Billy, Billy, Billy, Baroo button.  Oh, really?  Someone.  What about this?  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Oh, Billy, Billy.  It's a biggie.  It is a biggie.  It is a biggie.  Hey, Beltran.  Where's takes for nothing?  Yeah.  See?  Look.  Look at this one, Ben.  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Astoria. 
[00:02:30]  Oops.  What's going on over there?  It's over, Johnny.  Yep.  It's over.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Good morning.  You're a filthy whore.  Good lord.  We're waiting. 
[00:03:00]  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  You're just a tool.  I want to say good morning to Detroit.  I want to say congratulations on your World Series victory.  Yes.  Detroit.  It's all about Detroit.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Thank God we didn't go to Game 7 last night.  Thank God.  The depressing walkout where everybody's all just depressed.  Takes them ten times longer to leave the stadium.  They're all just whining.  No.  Looking around going, what happened?  You could just, at home, you could just, and.  Strike three, click.  Strike three, click.  And I'm asleep.  Strike three, click. 
[00:04:00]  And the pitch, it struck, click.  And do the snore.  Pillow hit.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Yeah.  There you go.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  So much easier to watch them at home.  Done ski.  I'm not sitting on a van weck.  I'm not sitting on the expressway trying to get home.  Well, congratulations to the Cardinals.  The Cards.  It's going to be the Cardinals and the Tigers, obviously, in the World Series. 
[00:04:30]  Go Detroit.  Detroit.  All the way.  It does look like Detroit's going to be the team.  A lot of people trying to make fun of me right off the bat.  Nopi, there's always next year.  Here's the deal, man.  The Mets, their team was falling.  This isn't the same team that did so well at the beginning of the season.  Yeah, from the regular season.  The freaking wheels were falling off as the playoffs started.  Did you see when they, like, panned the dugout and you just see Pedro with the cast on his arm?  Yeah, another guy with a freaking patch over his eye. 
[00:05:00]  One guy's got his head wrapped up like he took a shrapnel wound.  Like, what the hell?  Were they fighting in Iraq?  What happened?  The Mets bus get hit by a roadside explosive?  The frigging team was falling apart.  I think the equipment manager was pitching last night.  They had no one else.  Yeah, just a wreck.  So true Mets fans understand that team was hurting.  And it could have gone either way last night.  They did a good job.  Yeah, that's going to matter in the record books. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, hey, the highlight, the Chavez catch, come on.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  Yeah.  It turns it into a double play.  Yeah.  That's going to be, that one you'll see on a highlight reel every so often.  That one will pop up.  That should have been a home run, obviously.  Yeah, he just ripped off, ripped off a home run.  Brought it back into the stadium, Anthony.  He brought it back into the stadium.  Brought it back.  His arm bent back.  That was a great catch.  And then everybody, of course, you know, listening to 1010 Wins here in New York, we talked to  John Montone.  And he's like, at that point, they thought it was destiny. 
[00:06:00]  Mets destiny.  But soon that would change.  I'm John Montone.  John Montone.  Here at the stadium.  Lucky John Montone gets tickets to every game just so he could listen to people going,  well, you know, we're hoping for a Mets win.  He's hoping for a Mets win.  Indeed.  I'm John Montone.  Indeed.  Yes.  Let's go.  That's all he's doing.  Let's go to Chad in Wisconsin.  Chad, what's up? 
[00:06:30]  Hello, Chad.  Hey, hey.  You're homeless in the Mets' lives.  Oh, that hurts.  That does hurt.  What did Opie do to you, Chad?  Let's go to Hollywood.  In Detroit, what's up?  Sympathetic.  Hey, what's going on, New York?  I would like to invite you all onto the Detroit Tigers bandwagon.  Let me tell you, Hollywood.  Save me a seat.  Where do I sit?  Save me a seat.  I like to sit in the back.  Is there room?  You guys are famous, so you can sit anywhere you want to. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Nice.  We are on the bandwagon.  Detroit knows.  If they really were listening to me closely, I was pretty much saying Detroit, even though  my Mets were still in it.  Yeah.  So let me jump on this bandwagon with you.  Yes.  And I'd like to make a shout out to all my Kyle Talk friends.  All right.  Thank you, Hollywood.  No problem.  Well, just in case you couldn't stay up to one in the morning for the baseball game,  here's all you needed to hear.  This is all you need to know.  That's what we do on this show. 
[00:07:30]  Why waste four hours when you can get the recap in, let's see, a total of 60 seconds.  60 seconds.  Even this is long.  I know.  Jesus.  But in seventh tonight, he hits it in the air to left field.  Back is Chavez.  At the wall.  This ball is gone.  Two run, home run, Yadier Molina.  And St. Louis takes a 3-1, ninth inning, game seven lead.  Top of the ninth.  That was it. 
[00:08:00]  Top of the ninth.  You won one.  You hold him off for that long.  And then top of the ninth.  Crack.  There it goes.  But, you know, the Mets rally back to load up the bases with Beltran up.  And here's your moment to be a hero.  Just look at it. 
[00:08:30]  Don't bother swinging.  Just look at it.  How about you take a swipe at the ball?  How about at that?  How about you go down swinging?  How about when that's happening, do whatever you can to make whatever contact with that  ball you can.  I don't care if you have to hit it with your cock.  Oh, Jesus.  I hope somebody isn't late today in the dump room.  And you'd look pretty.  Get it with something, I guess I should have said. 
[00:09:00]  You would look so silly standing out there with a rooster, swinging that thing, trying  to hit a ball, Opie.  So I know that's what you meant.  Right.  A rooster.  All right.  Well.  Jesus Christ.  But, yeah.  You know, do anything you can to make some contact with that thing.  And it wasn't even a pitch that you looked at and went, well, that, come on, you're ripping  us off.  It was, that was right down the pipe.  Yeah.  And the final, the final out of the game was 15 minutes ago. 
[00:09:30]  So here it was.  Two quick strikes on Carlos Beltran with the bases loaded two out.  The Mets down by two.  Breaking ball struck him out.  And the Cardinals have won the pennants.  Wow.  How exciting.  What an exciting ending.  Molina leaps into the arms of Adam Wainwright.  A millionaire standing at the plate, watching a ball pass him by.  I'm looking with the bases loaded and the Cardinals celebrate before their trip to Detroit. 
[00:10:00]  I didn't hear any of that.  I hear, and they click.  Like, I'm not one of those watch the other teams celebrate kind of guy.  You know, even though the Mets are my team, but, you know, it's New York.  So it's just, and the pitch, a click.  Tell me when you turned it off, okay?  Okay, all right.  This is audio from Anthony's house.  Two quick strikes on Carlos Beltran with the bases loaded two out.  The Mets down by two. 
[00:10:30]  Click.  Visions of sugar plums dancing in my head.  What's that, man?  I've got to work.  Boston's having fun today.  All right, Boston.  Oh, come on.  We'll acknowledge you today.  Boston what?  All right, we'll acknowledge you today.  Hey, Jesus Christ. 
[00:11:00]  How long have they been off?  Have your little fun today.  Come on.  You guys can just do what we do now.  Go to football and vote for the Patriots.  Go Pats.  Go Pats.  Go.  The dynasty.  Shut up.  You know what sucked out yesterday?  It's the ALC, right?  And they didn't show.  They're showing all these great moments.  Yeah.  And, of course, Burr calls me out.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Can you believe this kid?  And they didn't show one 2004 Red Sox beating the Yankees. 
[00:11:30]  Why should they?  They showed Boone hitting that stupid home run, and they don't show the greatest comeback of all time.  What, are we supposed to sit through five games?  What highlight was there?  At the beginning when they show, this is it.  This is game seven.  Did they show that animal hit a home run or two?  Who?  Ortiz?  Yeah.  The silverback?  Did they show him hit a few?  Patrice at 185.  Patrice. 
[00:12:00]  Patrice without diabetes.  Patrice with a big piece of wood in his hand.  Bastard.  Yeah, there's no chicken on it.  Yeah, let's say hi to Daryl in Detroit.  It's all about Detroit this morning.  Yeah.  What's up, Daryl?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Pretty good, Daryl.  I just wanted to uninvite Opie from the Detroit bandwagon to do the Opie Curse.  The Opie Curse now for the new listeners, or relatively new listeners, new cities.  There's something called the Opie Curse. 
[00:12:30]  In sports especially.  It's in sports.  Although it didn't work for Peter Jennings as well.  Yeah, the good luck pro.  It is really, I'll say almost infallible, because I believe once in your whole career,  it didn't actually pan out, and the team you thought was going to win won.  But it was one of those, like, oh my god, of course they're going to win.  But anytime Opie predicts a team will win, they will lose, no matter how much they're favored.  Well, and now you're saying that Detroit is destined to win the World Series. 
[00:13:00]  This goes back to when I was doing overnights in Buffalo.  Oh boy.  Doing Buffalo Radio.  It's an old curse.  Oh yeah, it is.  I was in Buffalo for the four years that the Bills lost the Super Bowl.  Those were the years I was in Buffalo.  Those were the big years.  Actually, the last one I was in, I moved back home to Long Island.  But the first three, I was in Buffalo.  And then I moved home, and I believe the Giants lost in the Super Bowl, right?  If I'm not mistaken. 
[00:13:30]  Someone help me out there.  I know the Giants beat Buffalo one of those years.  One of those years.  Yeah, well that's when.  That was nice, that kick.  Oops.  And then we go, and we move to Boston, and we're up there when the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl.  That was 86.  No.  No, that was 90.  90, like, six, maybe.  96, yeah.  Something like that.  And Subway Series.  Just made.  Met fan.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It goes on and on. 
[00:14:00]  Islanders.  Well, I mean.  I mean.  But.  I mean.  They're.  Knicks.  Well.  Knicks fan.  They're rebuilding.  The Islanders are rebuilding.  The Knicks are rebuilding.  You know, I mean, come on.  Yeah, so it is a genuine sports curse that Opie has.  So, hey.  Good luck, bro.  That's what I'm telling Detroit.  Good luck, bro.  All right.  Starting Saturday.  Let's go to Chuck in Delaware.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling to warn Detroit to get their fire extinguishers out, because they 
[00:14:30]  might actually win this thing.  Yeah.  You think they're going to riot?  That's old school Detroit.  Well, they riot after the NBA.  Yeah.  Finals.  Yeah.  That's kind of a different crowd.  That's a different crowd, I think.  Right.  You know, in St. Louis, they won't riot.  No.  No.  They'll probably hold a giant picnic.  A candle vigil.  Candle vigil.  Everybody light your candles.  One, two, three.  Stupid St. Louis.  Sing some songs.  We could all hate St. Louis today. 
[00:15:00]  Know why?  Because we're not on in St. Louis.  Hey, that's right.  Let's beat them up.  They'll go to Beer Works.  St. Louis.  I was thinking that last night.  I'm watching.  It's like St. Louis.  Okay.  You know, they got a ball team here, and it sounds good, St. Louis.  And then you realize, oh, my God, that's in Missouri.  Now it really sounds, it's Missouri's baseball team.  Missouri.  Missouri.  Missouri.  What an awful state Missouri is.  Missouri.  Missouri. 
[00:15:30]  Missouri.  Say it at home.  If you say it too many times, it really starts sounding silly.  Missouri.  Look, I believe we all want a white America, but.  Oh, gee.  Wow.  Are you speaking for everybody?  But then you look at the stands.  We all want it.  Let's just all be honest with each other, right?  Oh, my God.  That inappropriate bell.  Then you look in the stands at those Cardinals games and go, wow, these are white people. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  They are as white as white can be.  Because they're from Missouri.  Missouri.  Missouri.  Fruit.  What the hell is Missouri?  I was just there last Sunday.  No, you weren't.  I was in St. Louis.  Oh, okay, St. Louis.  See, I don't even consider, because people get confused.  They go, St. Louis.  That's like Chicago.  A lot of people go, oh, yeah.  They actually think it's a state, Chicago.  Yeah.  They don't realize it's Illinois. 
[00:16:30]  It's the same thing with St. Louis.  St. Louis.  St. Louis.  You go, oh, it's St. Louis.  Oh, my God.  That's not a state.  It's in Missouri.  Missouri.  It's in Missouri.  Horrid state.  And they can't even commit to anything.  They build that stupid arcs.  It's like, oh, we can't go anywhere.  Bring it back down.  We're going up with this thing.  Up, up, up.  We're going to connect it to the, um, uh, I just put it back down to the other side.  We're going to build a building to the heavens.  No, we can't.  We can't. 
[00:17:00]  We can't.  It's going to go from the ground to a big skyscraper we're going to build here.  Right, right.  It's going to go right to the top floor.  You'll be able to take, oh, we're not building a skyscraper?  All right, just make a big upside down you.  Bring it back down.  That shows a lack of commitment.  The arch.  That's a lack of commitment.  That's a city filled with poohahs.  Just make a mirror image of what we just built.  Right.  People will never know.  And see, you went to St. Louis.  Yes.  Missouri.  Yes.  Missouri.  Have you ever been anywhere else in Missouri?  No, I don't think.  I think you can't leave. 
[00:17:30]  There isn't another place.  Anybody that has visited Missouri, it's Sogro St. Lou.  That's the only place you've been.  The arch.  The stupid arch.  We're going to build the biggest structure ever.  What's up with hating Missouri?  I forgot.  We do have a satellite audience.  We have enough people listening on XM.  We don't need the Missourians.  Yeah.  Go away, Missouri.  We hate you today, Missouri.  How do you guys hate a whole state?  Just wake up and hate Missouri. 
[00:18:00]  I know, because one of our guys choked last night in the ninth.  You guys hate Missouri because Ori at the end.  Ori.  They're too white.  Just watch that ball whiz right by you, you jackass.  Well, then we got a little postgame with Beltran.  Beltran.  Beltran.  I feel bad, personally, because it didn't come true.  But like I say, you know, I leave everything I have up there today, you know, and we all  did.  You know, this is something that when we win, we win as a team. 
[00:18:30]  When we lost, we lost as a team.  And I just feel like, you know, of course, I didn't, you know, I didn't come through.  But, you know, it happens to me a lot of times this season.  Yeah.  You know what?  They're not saying the same thing behind your back.  It happened to me.  The son of a bitch just watched it.  That's what they're saying.  He just watched it.  Yeah.  But that Puerto Rican accent is so cute.  Yeah.  It happened to me.  Sometimes it goes to you.  It happens back to us together.  So now what?  I'm the bad guy.  Okay.  Now you can say, okay, I'm the bad guy. 
[00:19:00]  Take a look at the bad guy.  Pedro's arm is so polluted.  It can't even pitch a ball.  Missouri.  Our bullpen is so polluted.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Next to the Busch Stadium in St. Louis is so exciting.  They have the Bowling Hall of Fame. 
[00:19:30]  Ah.  See, there you go.  The Bowling Hall of Fame is in Missouri.  They're too white.  They can't commit to a building going straight up.  What?  And they got the Bowling Hall of Fame.  The Bowling Hall of Fame.  Well, if I knew that, I would have given Missouri a lot more love.  Meet me in St. Louis.  Louis.  Meet me in.  Don't tell me the lights are shining anyplace but there.  Okay, where is this from? 
[00:20:00]  Okay, terrific.  1944.  I'm looking in your tootsie-wootsie.  Meet me in St. Louis.  Meet me in St. Louis.  Oh, hold on.  I'll be out in a minute, Agnes.  Meet me at the fair.  There won't be collards there.  I'm not shining anyplace but there.  See, go, see, go, see, go, see, go, see.  Go, see.  We'll be out soon. 
[00:20:30]  We're building up.  We're building up.  We're building up.  No, this is too scary.  Bring it back down.  Bring it back down.  Put a window at the top and take it back down.  I'm scared.  How the hell does the elevator work in that thing?  That's all I need to know.  Yeah, there's an elevator in there.  What does it go sideways?  It's like Bugs Bunny's elevator to get out of his rabbit hole.  Remember that?  It went sideways and he's just standing there.  Defying gravity.  Even four years old, you knew that was impossible. 
[00:21:00]  How do you remember this song?  Because Rush covered it.  All right, here we go.  Listen, so this is what we do today.  We acknowledge New York today.  Yes.  We acknowledge Detroit today.  Go Tigers, go.  Yep.  Bandwagon jumpers right here.  We acknowledge Boston today because they're having a lot of fun this morning.  They're very, very happy.  They're very happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  20 years later, they're very, very happy.  Okay.  Is Missouri the show me state? 
[00:21:30]  Of course it is.  Yeah.  Show me a black person.  There.  I just tripped them.  I just tripped up their whole state motto.  Jesus.  Well, you know, they got some crazy ghettos.  What is it, East?  East St. Louis?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Doesn't he have the M13 gang or something out there, too?  What's your state tree?  The noose?  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Nelson in St. Louis.  Awful racist state.  What's up, my boys?  From the fine state of Missouri.  Missouri. 
[00:22:00]  Now, East St. Louis is Illinois.  We ship all the shwuggies over there.  Yeah, that's funny.  Wow.  How did it start?  It's only 20 minutes in.  Huh?  Keep pulling for the Tigers there, O.  I will.  All right there, buddy.  Tigers all the way.  Yeah, that's it, buddy.  I know St. Louis is the home of Budweiser.  We know that.  You must have tied one on last night.  But I'm sure they're so responsible that they, like, stop beer sales after the first inning.  Oh.  Got to make sure everyone gets home safely. 
[00:22:30]  Stop serving beer after the first inning.  We have fiddle faddle, if you would like.  You could fiddle faddle.  One inning of beer drinking.  Right.  And fiddle faddle.  And then there's, like, when you're driving home from the game, there's the little things.  Free coffee and donuts.  Pull over and rest.  Rest your eyes.  Oh, St. Louis stinks.  Oh, wow.  Philly would eat them alive.  Missouri.  It does.  It sounds a little too close to misery. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And that must be what it's like to live there.  All right.  Well, we're just warming up.  I watched something before I went to bed last night.  We'll talk about it after the break.  Oh.  But I know what it is.  Yeah, you do.  I saw The Bridge.  Ah.  We'll talk about that next.  The Bridge.  I'll tell you about it, Bob.  Bob Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Jim Norton in San Francisco tonight and tomorrow. 
[00:23:30]  Different comedy club than he usually does.  He's at Cobbs, actually.  Cobbs.  Okay, thank you.  Huge comedy club.  Cobbs, it's like 400-seater, too.  It's like an old rock and roll club.  Right on.  And the movie I saw was about, you know, the Golden Gate Bridge there.  Yeah, beautiful.  It is beautiful.  Beautiful motion picture.  It also could be horrific.  And we'll get into that next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the O.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.

[00:25:00]  I might have a live show, and when I thought of that, it's because the cause doesn't, you  know, like the, um, the kids, you should have the guy from Philly come out.  Okay.  Phil.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  What's your malfunction?  Huh?  What's your malfunction?  There's a little problem?  No, no, no.  It's just my accent.  What accent?  What accent is that?  The accent of the retard.  No, no. 
[00:25:30]  I'm not a retard.  No, no.  He's a pudding brain.  I'm German, Polish, French, and Indian.  He's a retard.  You're German, Polish, French, and Indian?  Yeah.  It's my background.  That's the exact DNA of a retard.  I hear a little...  Right.  But where were you born?  I was born in Rochester, New York.  Rochester, New York?  Yeah.  Okay.  But then how do you have an accent like that?  This is just...  I don't know.  I just have a small accent, but...  Oh, it's a good person. 
[00:26:00]  It might be too early to try to figure out what you're saying, but we'll try again.  What do you want to say?  Yeah, but one thing I was trying to say is that...  Trying to say.  I think there's episodes you did with...  Episodes you did.  And you guys were doing the three stuces and stuff, which was kind of cool, too.  Because I'm new to the show.  Oh, you're new to the show and you're liking what you're hearing, I guess.  Yeah, you guys are cool.  And I was wondering, are you guys going to be coming...  Are you going to be doing it until next time?  And I was wondering if you guys could come into Rochester or not.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  We had to abort that phone call.  We're on in Rochester.  You know, he just killed a kitten.  He just got so mad at you guys.  Petting it real hard and holding the body and then you just hear that little snap.  They hung up on me!  Hey, I'm going to give out some advice today.  It's simple.  Before you go to bed, do not watch a movie on suicide.  Because all night long, you will be thinking about jumping. 
[00:27:00]  And you know how you can't really control your brain that well when you're dreaming?  So all night long, I'm walking toward a bridge.  What the F?  You've got to watch Happy Things.  I've tried that same thing with porn and it doesn't work in your favor.  Where you watch a porn...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You watch a porn just before you go to bed thinking, all right, I'm going to have some  great sex dreams.  Nah.  It doesn't work that way.  But a movie about suicide and people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, well, it works now.  You know, all night long, in my dream, I'm just walking toward a bridge and have that 
[00:27:30]  panic and that fear and that stress as I'm trying to dream.  Do you jump?  Of course I don't jump.  You know, if you hit the water in your dream, you really die.  Why?  It's true.  Nathaniel just said it's true.  Yeah.  I love that.  You heard that growing up all the time.  You know, when you've fallen in a dream, yeah.  You know, if you're hit, you actually die.  Dude, my aunt has a dream book. 
[00:28:00]  Who told you that?  Who told you that?  And what your dream means, you walking toward the bridge all night long, means...  It means I watched a movie.  Right.  That's all it means.  With people jumping off a bridge.  You're thinking of going in a different career path and, oh, shut up with your dream book.  I love the dream analysis, yeah.  You know what it means?  It means I was watching a movie or a TV show or I did something today.  It just reflects back in your dream. 
[00:28:30]  It doesn't have to mean something so deep.  Anyone ever get this one?  Your chick dreams that you're cheating and then she's mad at you the next day?  You ever get that one?  Wow.  You ever get that one?  What?  No.  She dreams that you're cheating.  She wakes up and she's mad at you.  She's mad at you for dream cheating?  For dream cheating.  I'm like, but I didn't cheat.  Wow.  But what did I do?  Huh?  What did I do?  Right.  You were cheating in my dream.  Right.  I saw it. 
[00:29:00]  I was watching you with another girl.  And what?  But it was in your head.  Right.  What happened?  How do I get out of this trouble I'm in?  I'm not alone.  That's when you just play stupid and you ask her, how do I get out of this problem I'm  in right now with you?  Dan, you're going to admit to something?  Yes.  I, uh, yes.  I've had a girl, actually, she woke up, she recoiled across the room and wouldn't let me  touch her for the rest of the night because she dreamed I was cheating on her.  See?  I'm not alone. 
[00:29:30]  That's a biggie.  Would you meet her, NYU?  Without that dream part, it sounded really creepy.  She's just recoiling and staying away from you.  I led with the wrong information.  Yeah, yeah.  Should have said she had a dream and the result was...  You have a two-headed goo-goo stick.  Wow.  What was the dream?  Yeah.  You must have done something awful in that dream.  I think I hooked up with her sister in it.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  That's a bad one.  Yeah, she was... 
[00:30:00]  You, get away from me.  What?  I just...  And you can't comfort them because they think you're the a-hole.  It's like, baby, baby, go back to sleep and dream that I just got you a car or something  really nice.  I did something nice for you.  You try to talk to them logically like, well, but I was dreaming I was flying.  Yeah.  I can't fly.  Did you ever have a dream?  And this has happened to me a couple times where I dreamed about being with this really  hot chick. 
[00:30:30]  Not my girl.  Some other girl.  Really hot.  Like, you know, Spanish girl.  And I'm making love to her and doing all kinds of cookie stuff.  And then I wake up and I'm actually having sex with my girl and I just go, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's like you wake up in a dream.  Wait, you're actually in the act?  I'm in the act.  I'm actually in my dream wind up like, I guess, touching my girl, you know, on a chest or something  and it triggers off this sex dream.  But it's with this other hot girl that I don't know.  It's not real.  Right.  So you're dreaming that.  And you're actually having sex. 
[00:31:00]  You're actually, but you've actually gotten to the point where you're technically completely  doing the act.  No, no, no.  Not like I'm making out and I'm touching and I'm doing what I was doing in the dream.  Like, almost just about to, you know, have sex, but I'm grabbing booze.  Oh, okay.  And I'm making out.  And I'm making out.  That's pretty resourceful if, like, you're dreaming but you're actually doing it.  But my girl now is fully awake and thinks I'm making moves.  But really, I'm having sex with her, but she's somebody else. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  And she could just look and your eyes would be closed.  You'd be drooling.  Yeah, but then I'd roll over.  Then are you going to roll over and pretend you're asleep?  That would be a bunch of times, I swear to God.  We hit on something here.  Tom in New York City.  Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Good morning.  Yo, a couple weeks ago, my wife wakes me up in the middle of the night.  She's like, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I just had a dream that you were cheating.  She would talk to me all day, bro. 
[00:32:00]  And I had to explain it away.  It was, like, ridiculous.  It was funny, but ridiculous.  An explanation.  But she woke you up in the middle of the night to tell you that you just cheated in her dream?  I'm like, but I was sleeping.  I was like, I'm right here.  And she's like, no, I had a dream and something's up.  Well, great.  Well, in my dream, I was taking on the entire, all of the Nazis by myself and I won.  Yeah, so how could I have been cheating?  Right.  I was in a tunnel.  I was in an underground tunnel.  You mean you were preaching to all the Nazis and then you guys won?  Let's go to Pete in New York. 
[00:32:30]  Pete, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Oh, man, my girlfriend had the same stupid dream.  And she's pissed.  I didn't work nights.  So I come home, wake her up, you know, kiss her on the face.  And she's instantly pissed off.  Get away from me, she says.  I'm like, what?  What the hell is going on?  Well, you were cheating in my dream.  The entire...  That is hysterical.  And then all of a sudden it's your problem.  I'm like, what?  I'll tell you, women really think they have some, like, sixth instinct that if I dreamed  it, it must be true. 
[00:33:00]  My women instinct...  Wow, that must be it.  Yeah.  It is.  Womb power.  I think it's a womb power.  Like, you know, my woman thing told me.  The only reason I'm dreaming it is because something that you've done hit my subconscious.  Right.  And when I went to sleep, it manifested itself in the dream.  And as a woman...  Did it.  My womb tells me with the power of the womb...  Yes.  Oh my God.  You know what?  I was going to talk about this movie, The Bridge, which is amazing.  And we're going to have the director in today. 
[00:33:30]  And we're going to have one of the guys that jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and survived.  We got some great radio today.  But now we're on this weird tangent.  So we got to go with it.  Are you sure that wasn't the call we took earlier?  We hung up on?  I love you guys.  Guy that survived.  I love you guys.  Please come to Bacheter.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Hey there, Mike.  Let's go.  You got to make it fast because the phones have exploded.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  A little more energy.  A little more energy.  We're faking the energy.  We're just as tired as you guys that are calling this show. 
[00:34:00]  But we get up for the program.  My ex-girlfriend once had a dream that she got pregnant.  And I gave her herbs to give her an abortion.  She ended up actually breaking up with me over it.  She thought.  Wait, wait, wait.  Girlfriend dreamt I made her get abortion?  She dreamt that she got pregnant.  Right.  And I gave her herbs.  I'm an amateur herbalist.  And I gave her herbs.  I gave her an abortion.  A herbalist?  Right.  Isn't it an herb, by the way?  We like to call them herbs. 
[00:34:30]  If you're a professional, call it an herb.  The H is silent.  It sure is.  And herb.  And you're in the business.  Herb is a name.  Herb is a thing.  A plant.  I'm a herbalologist.  I'm a herbalist.  A herbalist.  I know everything about herbs.  Hey, I could give you some of these herbs for the abortion.  Hey, Rhett, get some herbs.  All right, let's go to Stephen and Ryan.  Great iced tea.  Stephen.  Hey, Stephen. 
[00:35:00]  My wife woke up the other morning scared endless of me because she dreamed that I had  bludgeoned her.  That's a good one.  She's telling me, she's asking me, did I change the life insurance policy?  All kinds of nonsense.  Wow.  They really put a lot of credence in these dreams.  Yeah, it was wild.  Take care, guys.  I take dreams for what they are.  I don't care what the hell happens.  Some dreams I wake up there are just horrific, like awful dreams. 
[00:35:30]  And some of them are a lot of fun.  And it's a crapshoot.  And then you wake up and you take it for what it is.  Sometimes, like, you feel a little creepy for a little while, but it goes away because  it's a dream.  It's not real life.  You ever dream and you wake up and you say to yourself, wow, I didn't realize that was  in my head.  Where did that come from?  I didn't know.  I was an expert on Russian literature.  I didn't know it was some bizarre thing.  But that happened.  I was a ninja.  Right.  You know, I have a recurring dream, and it's frightening as it's happening. 
[00:36:00]  But I laugh every time I wake up because it recurs so many times.  It's sometime years ago, I had either helped people or had myself killed somebody.  Oh, God.  And I must have buried them or disposed of the body somehow and never even thought about  it.  And then the cops, I realized something happened where the cops now found this body, and they're 
[00:36:30]  doing all kinds of forensics on it, and they're kind of, like, I know I go, oh, my God, I  know I left something there.  There's, like, hair, or I think I left, like, a piece of clothing or something, and I know  I'm going to be in prison for the rest of my life.  Oh, my God.  I think that's a popular one.  They're going to get me.  And in your dream, they're starting to get suspicious, and they're starting to look at you.  And the cops are starting to look at you.  And you get a little paranoid, like, why, why?  And then you wake up and go, oh, I'm out of trouble.  How great is that? 
[00:37:00]  When you wake up and go, oh, my God, that was a dream.  I beat the rap.  I just had to wake up.  Start singing with the birds at that point.  There's that recurring one.  One other recurring one.  Something happens where bad guys, whatever type of bad guys are chasing you.  Ah, the blacks.  And, well, it's not always.  Usually, actually, white guys.  But I can't.  I have weapons.  But either the bullets won't fit or go in the gun, or you pull the trigger, and it's too hard to pull, 
[00:37:30]  or the bullet doesn't come out of the barrel right or something.  Keith.  Yeah, that's the one I get.  You get that one?  Well, it's a work-related dream.  Well, yeah.  I mean, for police officers, I'm sure they have that one all the time.  Yeah, like when all of a sudden you'll be chasing somebody, and you turn the corner, and they have a gun,  and you pull your gun out, and you squeeze the trigger, and, like, the slide doesn't go.  So you keep pulling it and pulling it and click, and then the shot goes off from him, and then you wake up,  and you're like, holy crap.  Oh, got out of that one. 
[00:38:00]  Sweating.  Let me clean my pistol.  Yeah, that's the work dream.  It has that, depending on what they do for a living.  Why do I have that dream?  It's not work-related for me.  Well, you are Italian.  Who knows what you're doing when this show's over.  It's true.  I have the dream where, like, I'm in a pretty dress, and my hair is beautiful, like, feathered.  Aw.  Must be disappointing when you wake up, and you're you.  Hey, it just goes on. 
[00:38:30]  I'm glad I'm not alone on this one.  Jimmy in Queens, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah, I was spooning with my girl when I sleep, and, you know, she had a dream, and she started hitting me,  and I didn't know what it was, and I'm just, like, trying to go back to sleep.  Next thing I know, she elbows me so hard, right in the nose, I'm bleeding all over the place.  I'm eating in a dream.  I'm talking, crushing blood from her elbow, and then she still pissed off at me after all this,  and I'm like, what did I do?  What did I do? 
[00:39:00]  She's like, you were sleeping with her.  I know it.  I know it.  Two days she was pissed at me.  Two days.  Two days for a dream.  Wow.  Yeah, but you know we're all actually cheating, so we're, like, freaking out like a...  They know.  You know he was actually cheating on his girl.  Yeah, he was cheating.  She was like, how'd you know?  How'd you know?  How'd you know?  Let's go to Luke in Jersey.  Luke.  All right, this is Lou.  L-O-U.  Hey, Lou.  What's up, buddy?  Lou.  Frankus.  I can't do it.  Jimmy's in San Francisco.  What's up, Luke? 
[00:39:30]  I got a, uh, my girl had a dream.  You know the girl, Cameron, the doctor in house?  Yeah, of course.  I had a dream that I was banging her, and she saw me at a party with her, and I was just  totally mean to her, she said.  For three days, she wouldn't talk to me.  That's funny.  Totally mean.  You were mean to me.  Exactly.  What did I do?  You wouldn't talk to me.  Nothing.  But wait, no, what did I do?  You were with some girl, and I came up, and you ignored me, and said, it was a dream. 
[00:40:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  And it says she didn't talk to you.  That's funny.  She didn't talk to you for three days after that?  Three days.  She wouldn't take up her phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sick bitch.  Frankus.  Uh, let's go to this one.  A couple more, or then we'll move on.  Uh, Sam in Idaho.  Hi.  Yeah.  Idaho.  You the hoe.  My wife.  Hi.  Yeah, Idaho.  So, my wife had a dream that I was cheating on her with her twin sister, and woke up just swinging  and beating the crap out of me, and I got out of bed, finally got out away from her 
[00:40:30]  and out of bed, and, uh, got her calmed down, and the only thing I can do to explain  it away is just make a joke out of it and ask her if her sister was any good in the  dream.  Well, that's, that's a way to smooth it over.  Yeah, right on, man.  All right, let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Rob.  Hey, guys.  I live with my girlfriend.  She's an identical twin.  And woke up hysterical several times in the middle of the night that I'm sleeping with 
[00:41:00]  my identical twin sister.  Do you notice this little pattern here?  I guess girls that have a twin sister have this thing, probably a recurring dream, that  their boyfriend or husband is sleeping with the sister.  Yeah.  Because they probably had such competition with each other their whole life that it just  stays with them.  But if you're going to cheat, aren't you going to go out and find, like, a different  poo-ha?  No.  Why would you cheat with the same poo-ha?  You're hysterical.  You know, I never even put it in that context where it's like, you're going to cheat. 
[00:41:30]  You want a completely different girl.  Right.  You might as well just stay with the girl you're with.  Well, why would you-  Oh, God, I love the way you look.  Why would you put yourself through hell by sleeping with a twin sister?  The chick I'm with is a pig.  That's why I'm cheating with you, her twin.  He really did swing her around.  Every single part is exactly the same.  Why?  Unless, of course, with the twin, you're able to just look at the back of her head, if  you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Maybe the twins into other things. 
[00:42:00]  That's why you're cheating.  I never even thought of it.  You're always like, twins, yeah.  Yeah.  I hope you just really put it into perspective.  Yeah.  Why are you going to want to do the same thing?  Just put a mirror in your room.  There, you were twins.  Now, if you're getting both at the same time, now, that's different.  That's like time travel.  Different.  It's like time travel.  Yeah.  You just swing over here, and then she's over there, and then she's over there, and  then she's over there.  Zipping around the room.  How'd you get down there?  You're up here.  But I just saw you.  Major Nelson, you were just over.  Let's go to Rich in Philly. 
[00:42:30]  Rich.  Yo, guys.  Hey there, Rich.  You'd play with the other twin, just so you know you picked the right one.  Oh, is that it?  Maybe the other one's a little more freaky?  Yeah.  But my ex-wife had a dream that there was a bug on the ceiling, woke up, and then woke me  up to squash this bug that wasn't there.  I'm running around 3 o'clock in the morning with no context, and looking for a bug that  doesn't exist.  Lunatic.  I should be able to hit them.  They're recurring dreams that I have that are like location shots. 
[00:43:00]  Like it's a set.  Yeah.  Like it's a certain house.  I'll always be in a certain house.  A certain car on a certain road.  It's always the same thing.  Same type of setting.  How do you know you dreamed that before, huh?  How do you know?  How do you know?  Because I remember.  How do you know you remember?  What are you saying?  I'm thinking one time, but your mind's saying, no, you've been dreaming this dream.  I'm thinking.  I remember.  I remember waking up and remembering it.  How do you remember?  Because I remember. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Don't say remember again.  That word is sounding silly.  It's like Missouri.  Missouri.  Do you remember?  Oh, Missouri finally came back to normal for not saying it.  Now, Jimmy brings us all the way around to make sure the girls stay paranoid.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Jim.  My ex-girlfriend had a dream one time.  She woke up all pissed off.  Listen, you know, I know you're cheating on me.  I said, really?  Well, what does the girl look like?  You know, because I was kind of curious.  I was doing good.  And she actually described the girl almost as if she was looking at the picture to the 
[00:44:00]  T that a girl that I had started fooling around with.  I told her.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, now you are going to get the girls going.  See?  We do have this.  Oh, boy.  Every girl.  We do have this.  Womb power.  Womb power.  My estrogen is magical.  Our brains are directly connected to our wombs.  Oh, boy.  It's like a cheating sonar in our bellies.  You look inside there.  There's a magic eight ball.  Shake it.  All right.  We got a girl's perspective.  Signs point to cheater. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  We got to move on because we're going to get a girl's perspective in one second.  But first, Brett in West Palm Beach.  Brett.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to call in.  I had a dream one time.  Oh.  I haven't done that in a while.  Are you still there, bro?  I'm here.  Are you there?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I hung up on you, but I got your back.  Wow.  I haven't done that in a while.  Go ahead.  No.  I had a dream one time.  I was in a fight, and I was wrestling with this guy, and the next thing I know, I'm getting 
[00:45:00]  an elbow in the ribs, and I wake up, and it's my wife, and she said, what the hell are  you doing?  I had her in a freaking chokehold.  Choking your wife.  Wow.  Great.  I love it.  I wonder how many people have actually killed their significant other because they were dreaming.  It was a complete accident, but sleep terrors.  But the law doesn't look at it that way.  You hear that?  Sleep terrors?  Night terrors.  Night terrors, yeah.  Sleep terrors.  Flip out.  Just like extreme nightmares or something, and they move around a lot.  Yeah.  Flip out. 
[00:45:30]  Just jump out a window.  Jay Davis did that.  Jay Davis jumped out a window.  Jumped out a...  The sliding glass door went right out, flipped.  He's got scars all over his body.  Wow.  Night terrors.  Just wakes up and...  Just runs through a window.  Let's go to Liz.  Horrid.  We get a chick's perspective here.  A lady's perspective.  Liz, New Jersey.  What's up?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I haven't dated for a while, and when I finally did hook up again, I was having sex with my new boyfriend in the middle of the night. 
[00:46:00]  I was dreaming it, but I actually was, and I was dreaming that I was having sex with my ex-boyfriend, and I was really having sex with my new boyfriend, and I was scared to death that he was going to find out.  And I opened my eyes, and I'm like, oh, my God, don't say the ex-boyfriend's name. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  Wow is right.  Fantasizing.  Yes.  In her dream.  Yay.  Wow.  Very good, Liz.  She woke up, and the guy was actually having sex with her.  Yeah.  So he was diddling her while she was sleeping.  Well, it almost seems like she was initiating it somehow through her sleep, and then she was still sleeping while they were having sex, and then would wake up.  He was initiating.  Let's be honest here.  He started groping or something.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  In the middle of the night, you wake up like, oh, look what I got.  All right, well, I got some with this.  Is she sleeping?  Right?  Just reach over.  I don't get the night terrors or anything like that, but I'll wake up, and it's not one of those wake up, like, right when I wake up, I go, ah, ah.  But if I wake up, I'll open my eyes, and let's say my girlfriend is awake, and she's kind of, like, looking at me, you know?  I'll look and go, like, oh, okay.  My girlfriend's awake.  She's looking at me.  Ah! 
[00:47:30]  Like, there'll be this delay where I completely assess the situation.  I know what's going on, so it shouldn't bother me at all, but just somebody looking at me right when I wake up will freak me out.  But it's not immediate, even.  It's like I'll open my eyes a little, be looking, and then she even says, you were looking at me for, like, ten seconds.  I was smiling at you, and then I'll just, ah, and wake up real quick, go, oh, you scared the crap out of me. 
[00:48:00]  That's weird.  Called me a lunatic.  All right, we got to take a break.  This leads to the movie I saw last night.  Yes.  I went off on a tangent, but the bridge.  That's why I was dreaming about walking toward a bridge all night long.  What is it?  What's the bridge?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Wait till you hear what these geniuses did.  Yeah.  We're going to have the director on today.  Yep.  It's a documentary.  We'll get into it next.  That's called a radio tease there, bud.  Also the fact.  You're the victim of a radio tease.  I know.  I set the radio tease up.

Wow.  600 pounds.  We don't know who's going to show up, so if one of these fat girls is listening, you've  got to show up anyway, because you really don't know.

And then pick up her fat roll and watch cell phones and keys and bottles of water just drop.  Things that you want to just throw away when you're done, because...  Anthony's computer just falls out.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Bob Kelly in for Jim Norton today.  Jim Norton playing what?  In San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:51:00]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Missouri.  Missouri.  Missouri.  They get their congrats.  We're back with the O.B.  And Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Go Tigers!  Go!  Yeah.  Bandwagon jumpers.  That's what we are.  Speaking of jumpers...  Jumpers.  Oh.  Good segue.  Actually, before that, let's go to Casey, a girl in Jersey. 
[00:51:30]  Casey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to share my story about the dreams real quick.  Yeah.  One day before my husband and I got married, first of all, we were always afraid that we  were going to get pregnant before we got married.  This is weak crap.  One night he was having a dream that I was having an affair with a black guy, and I got  pregnant.  So we wanted to make sure before I had the baby if it was his or not.  So when I had the baby, it was black.  He was so furious at me that when I woke up, the pillow was on my head, and he was in the 
[00:52:00]  shower.  He didn't talk to me the rest of the morning.  He was so mad at me.  Oh, so the dream continued up until you had a black baby.  Until I had a black baby.  Oh, okay.  This was all in his head.  In his dream.  So he wakes up, and now he's not talking to you because you slept with a black guy.  Wow.  And had a black baby.  And had a black baby, right?  Man, I knew I wasn't alone on this one.  You had a dream you had a black baby?  Oh, I thought, yeah.  Okay.  Is he still mad at you?  No, he's not mad.  All right.  Did you come in the house with a bag full of groceries and your father beat you up? 
[00:52:30]  On the dresser next to the bed in the morning, you find a banana with a bite taken out of  it.  Frank Vinson punching her in the face.  Frank Vinson.  Jesus.  All right, Casey.  Bye, guys.  Thank you.  We got to move on because we got a really busy show today.  By the way, Bob Kelly's sitting in for Jim Norton, and I'm obsessed with YouTube, and I was  watching you puking.  The Bob Kelly puking videos on YouTube are great.  Oh, if you put it in the search, don't be mistaken, that's not just one video of Bob 
[00:53:00]  puking, five, six, seven different versions of it.  No.  We have many.  It's different occasions.  There is so much video of you vomiting in different places, different situations for  different reasons.  I cannot get that hernia.  Oh, the fat woman who had the belly button hernia?  One of the contestants in Fatty Pig Fatty has a huge herniation.  Some people get hernias on the sides of their belly button or something like that. 
[00:53:30]  Hers was directly in the middle.  It was like cyclops eye right in the middle of her belly button, and it was all veiny.  Half a golf ball.  Yeah, but Opie said what it was, a vein, a vein.  A piece of our intestine.  And you could see, like a dirty fish tank.  Yeah, it was just a dirty fish tank pulsing through.  Yeah, just algae and stuff floating by.  Cells.  She needs a sucker fish in there to clean off the sides. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  I think on that appearance, you puked three times.  Yeah.  Just seeing it, you puked.  When Craig, our intern, started suckling on it, you puked again.  And all these videos were up on YouTube.  And she was like, be gentle, it hurts.  And my favorite Bob Kelly puking video is the one that Anthony filmed live on WISP when  we were down there for the ONA Travel Environment.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was the worst.  That's up there, too.  I think you just throw Bob Kelly puking in the search engine.  That was infection.  Ear infection guy. 
[00:54:30]  And guy who ate it.  Yeah.  I can't even say it.  Yeah.  He got a lot out of his ear.  It looked like he got attacked by a ghost.  Just had plasma on his finger.  Oh, that guy.  All right.  I don't want to talk about it.  Really?  Yeah.  Some of the other videos that are getting a lot of views is the girl kicking the guy  in the nuts outside XM.  That one is classic.  The edited version is great because it's the money shot over and over and over again. 
[00:55:00]  And the guy goes down hard.  The video's up on YouTube.  It's hilarious.  What happened?  She just, this guy agreed.  I think he wasn't all there.  They weren't even fans of our show.  They were fans of John Cena from the WWE.  He's in that movie, The Marine.  Yeah.  And they were waiting for him.  But we got him involved with our show.  We got this black girl to kick this white nerd in the nuts really hard over and over  again.  And we weren't happy with the results, even though he was going down every time.  The final one, you hear the thud.  That thud that's only made by a foot, a foot, a shoe going into a groin. 
[00:55:30]  And then you hear the gasp because there's no air.  And then he goes down hard.  And then they just loop it over and over again of him getting kicked.  Oh, my God.  That was great.  And then you hear a water balloon hit the ground and just splat.  We had him act out a little scenario where he called her a racial slur.  Yeah.  And then she, like, kicked him.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  Oh, it was great.  At least you guys have artistic qualities.  Yeah.  If you just kick to the groin like that, just the kick to the crotch is just self-serving. 
[00:56:00]  Those radio shows, you just, you know, do that.  You guys actually had a little scene.  Yeah.  You know.  We want to show up our writing skills.  Here, take this script.  She needed motivation.  Why is she kicking him in the crotch?  Yes.  Opie's making his little fingers into a box around the guy's crotch.  Let me see what this is going to look like on film.  A little storyboard.  That's a great video.  Storyboarded.  One shot.  Then we got our own Steve C. falling off a tiny, tiny, tiny little bike. 
[00:56:30]  He's riding a little clown bicycle.  That's hilarious.  A little bub.  It's a little clown bicycle, and people have taken to Photoshopping it and actually video  Photoshopping with After Effects and other software.  And they have one where this giant bullet carries the villains from the Super Mario game,  I think.  Yeah.  It's just chasing him around, and he keeps making him fall off the bicycle.  It's really funny.  We have very creative listeners. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, you do.  And then we got the poker chip thing.  That's getting a lot of views lately.  Me throwing the poker chips at that chick that brought it in as a present.  The most uncomfortable moments of my life.  Yeah.  Oh, listen to that.  Hey, here you go.  Smash.  Aw.  And then a brand new video that I don't know if it's officially up.  It takes time for YouTube to finally put it up there.  But we got Intern Craig again is a star of another Opie and Anthony video.  The guys, you know, we go home right at 11, and we just assume that our guys are working 
[00:57:30]  hard behind the scenes for us.  You know, and then in the morning, I see all the videos they've created instead of preparing  for the show.  And they got Craig spinning around in a chair really fast, because Craig's like, look, you  could spin me for, what, a minute straight or something like that?  Yeah.  He said, you could spin me in a chair for a minute, and I won't get sick.  Yeah.  It's in an office chair.  Yeah.  So they put him in the chair and start spinning him around really fast.  I was getting sick just watching that part of the video.  And then Danny decides to take one of the dodgeballs from Bully. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, from Bully.  It's one of those real heavy rubber dodgeballs, textured on the outside, the kind that go  boom, boom, make that boom, almost a ringing sound, boom, when it hits.  And just, he's spinning, and he comes around, and the second the side of his face faces Danny,  Danny just wails the ball into his face.  It's a perfect shot.  It's hysterical.  At this point, Craig is spinning pretty fast, but he nails him right in the face.  And again, they just loop it. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, that video's up on YouTube as well.  You see it five times in a row, him just taking it right in the face.  It's great.  Every morning, it's fun to just throw Opie and Anthony in the search, and you see all  sorts of new videos.  You don't know what's going to turn up.  Videos from us, videos from the listeners.  It's good.  Videos from our enemies.  Yeah.  They're all up there.  So there you have it.  All right.  At 8 o'clock, we got the director of this movie, The Bridge, coming in.  And also, I think by 8.30, around 8.30, 8 o'clock hour, definitely, we got a guy that 
[00:59:00]  jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and lived.  I don't think that happens often as far as living.  No.  And I did some research on the Golden Gate Bridge after watching this movie.  I guess about 1,200 people have jumped since it opened up in 1937.  1,200 people.  They have a whole graph online of where they jumped from, the light poles.  Yeah.  They name.  They have numbers for all the light poles across the span, and then they mark how many  suicides from each light pole.  Who the first guy was? 
[00:59:30]  Who was the first guy?  Just sitting there.  I'm just going to smoke one last lucky and jump.  The guy who had to paint this.  I don't know.  This sucks.  Stupid orange paint.  This job stinks.  This job sucks.  I'm going to be here forever.  Right.  All right, I'm done.  Okay, now do it again.  Be here forever.  Start over because it's fading.  Right.  Screw this.  Enough with the orange paint.  Can we change colors? 
[01:00:00]  I mean, I'm getting a little bored here.  How about something a little yellow?  Yellowy.  Something a little brighter, for God's sake.  It's depressing me.  Just painted a rainbow, you.  It would be great if they found out that color just makes people want to kill themselves.  That's crazy.  That orange.  That orange.  That exact shade of orange makes people want to jump.  Yeah, they can't figure it out.  But this movie came to our attention, and I don't know.  It just so happened.  A year ago.  Was it about a year ago?  Yeah, because that was when there was a lot of controversy as to whether it was going to be a film or not. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Because San Francisco, the people in charge over there were really kind of pissed off.  They said that they had filmed the bridge under false pretenses.  Well, yeah.  They don't want people knowing that a lot of people jump off this bridge.  So they said they were just doing a documentary on the bridge and set up cameras and just let them roll.  They set up a bunch of cameras on both sides of the bridge.  It looks like not on the actual bridge, but on the land, and they can look up at the bridge.  Yeah, some zoomed in and some long shots. 
[01:01:00]  And then they had to have a guy pretty much every day for, I think it was a year, was zooming in on people, potential jumpers.  Yeah.  And then you'd see them with their cell phone, and then you'd realize they're just tourists checking out the-  Just looking over the edge.  Looking over the edge like we all do when you're on a high structure.  John Travolta and Double J dancing on it.  Right, right, right.  Double J.  Look, Tony, I'm dancing.  Come on back in here.  What are you doing?  Can you dig it?  I knew you could.  No, it's not a jumper. 
[01:01:30]  It's John Travolta.  He's just dancing.  So this is kind of weird.  We didn't even think about this movie for about a year, and earlier this week we brought it up again.  And it turns out the movie's being released a week from today.  It's like a documentary.  It's like an IFC-type movie, okay?  And the director's coming in today.  And we got screener copies.  I watched the whole movie last night, hence going to bed and having a dream that I was walking toward a bridge all night long.  And then Anthony got a peek at the film this morning.  A little peek of some of it this morning. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  So they show somebody jumping off.  Somebody.  Somebody.  They showed a bunch of people.  A few people.  But they also go to the families of these people and get interviews with them about what the people were about and what they were like and what the troubles they had were.  So they kind of like, yeah, back, kind of backtracked after the person killed themselves and found out all the information about it.  It's called filler.  Right.  It's called, yeah.  Well, you know, it would pretty much be a snuff film unless you put that stuff in. 
[01:02:30]  It's not filler because.  No, they did a great job.  You start feeling for these people.  It sucks, obviously, to see anyone, like, you know, decide to end their life by jumping especially.  That's just, like, so creepy.  Yeah.  And, you know, if you didn't know the people, it still sucks.  But then you get to know the people before they actually jump.  And now you're like, oh, please don't jump.  I know all about you now.  I know that guy.  It's going to be okay.  It's going to be okay.  You're going to be okay.  That's why I hate this director. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, they made a great film.  But these guys don't take into account, like, wind.  And, you know, they think they're just going to jump and go down to the water and they're dead.  But some guys jump and then the wind hits them and then they smash into the bridge, right?  Are you talking like you know something about this?  Well, I actually had a friend of mine who, back in, not a friend, a kid I knew in high school jumped off a bridge in Beantown.  But the same time the guy who, remember the guy with his wife?  Charles Stewart.  Charles Stewart. 
[01:03:30]  The same day.  Tobin Bridge.  He jumped off the bridge.  The same week, two days apart.  The kid I knew.  So he got no press.  He got nothing.  Yeah.  Did he die?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, but sometimes they don't die.  Sorry, Bob.  Bob looks at you.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  No, I'm sorry.  You're right.  But they hit the.  Sometimes the wind blows him back.  They hit the thing.  They don't die from.  They lay softly on land.  Dude.  Dude, they hit the thing.  Sometimes, dude.  They hit the thing.  Dude.  And then they, sometimes they don't even hurt them. 
[01:04:00]  So maybe they break their knee, dude.  Broke his knee, dude.  Hold my hand.  So there's one guy that lived, you said.  Yeah.  Nice lady.  All right.  He's calling it for the show.  So really fast.  So these guys set up the cameras and they watched the bridge, I believe, for a year.  We'll get some more info when the director comes in.  And it's so creepy because they'll start following people.  Like, they'll zoom in on people, like I said.  And some are just taking pictures.  But then you see some of these people like, oh my God, this guy is depressed.  You see him looking much differently over the side than other people would. 
[01:04:30]  And then all of a sudden they show him, like, going over the rail.  And then holding on.  And you're like, oh my God.  And then you're like, there's no way.  And then sure enough, you see him jump.  Whee.  You see him jump.  And then they have long shots in this movie.  Because I guess they can't follow every person on the bridge.  So they have a long shot that's just set up pretty much 24-7, I would assume.  Yeah.  And every once in a while during the movie, they show the long shot of the bridge.  Yeah.  And you'll see a massive splash.  You'll just see a big splash.  You won't see anyone jump. 
[01:05:00]  That's another person jumping.  You'll just see a huge splash.  What are the bloopers like at the end of this movie?  Wow.  Cut, cut.  They discovered, they found, I should say, the most depressing music ever to just run through the whole movie.  And I was telling Anthony.  Kurt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise do the outtakes at the end.  Yeah.  I was telling Anthony in the office, I'm like, Brock Yates and Hal Needham.  Sorry, Al.  That's okay.  It's all right. 
[01:05:30]  Where's the elephant?  I'm sorry.  I was telling Anthony in the office, the movie's depressing enough.  And then they find this really, like, just gloomy, dark music to play behind the whole movie.  It's beautifully filmed, though, man.  It's unbelievable.  So there's a guy, when the guy jumps, the guy climbs up.  There's a guy watching this.  Yeah.  So there's a human that might be able to hit a button and hit the police.  Well, suppose that they had, I think it's called, they call it Bridge Patrol or something like that. 
[01:06:00]  Well, the filmmakers had them on speed dial.  An original name.  They had them on speed dial.  Right.  And that's what I want to ask the director.  There were guys, they were obviously jumping.  And they're on film for a while before they jump.  It's like, were you calling Bridge Patrol?  The director was like, wait.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Just like Shatner calling for his wife in the pool, I bet.  Wait for it.  What is it?  Nine, one, what?  Yeah.  One, one, one.  Nine, one.  What are those numbers?  I did a show that was Rescue Nine One. 
[01:06:30]  My phone won't flip open like in the show.  I can.  Scotty.  Scotty.  Not getting a signal.  Not getting a signal.  That's, yeah.  Because there's a guy watching.  And as the guy's climbing up, this guy's zooming in.  Oh, yeah.  And when he jumps, does the camera go down with him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As best as he can.  Yeah.  They don't mess around, man.  They want to get the money shot.  Do they hold up like a nine, eight?  Judges.  Oh, look at the Ukrainian judge not giving him a high enough score.  No, it was creepy.  They showed one guy jump, and seconds later, a guy was at the spot where the guy jumped 
[01:07:00]  and threw a flare into the water because they wanted to see where the currents are going  so they can find the body.  Yeah, they're like flare guys apparently.  I'm like, man, if you were right there, they know what's going on.  The second it happens, one of these guys knows they probably have these flares either  on them or at places on the bridge.  I'm not sure.  I want to ask the guy this.  Right.  And then they pull it and throw it in the water right where the guy landed so that if  the current starts taking the guy away, once the Coast Guard gets there, which seems pretty 
[01:07:30]  quickly, they can kind of get an idea of which way the water's going and where the guy might  be.  They show one person jump, and then the Coast Guard is fishing the body out of the water.  It is an unbelievable, a very powerful, very powerful movie.  You learn a lot about suicide and what goes on in these people's heads because they talk  to the family and friends, and the family and friends, they didn't know what else to do.  Like, this person was talking about killing themselves for years, and they knew this person  was serious, and they didn't know what else to do. 
[01:08:00]  So they pretty much gave up and said, well, if you're going to kill yourself, at least  please say goodbye before you do it.  Do they have any video of the people's talking about it?  No, no, no.  You know what I mean?  Nothing like that.  I had a dream that my wife left with a black guy.  They showed some suicide notes.  That was probably maybe more creepy than actually seeing him jump for some reason in my stupid  head.  I didn't get to see what happened to Rocker guy.  Oh, he's the grand finale, man.  Is he the grand finale?  That's all I'll say.  He's the grand finale.  I don't want to give everything away.  I mean, the movie is self-explanatory, obviously. 
[01:08:30]  But then they show people being rescued.  I want to know about that.  How many people are rescued?  Because at the end of this film, they said it was filmed in 2004.  I don't know if he did the whole year or not, but they said 24 people killed themselves jumping  off the bridge in 2004 alone.  24.  And it's up to something like over 1,200 since 1937.  And of course, it all comes down to cost on the internet when I was looking up some facts  about the Golden Gate Bridge.  They have designs and budgets so this would not happen.  And they have like, I think they've had seven designs over the years to keep people from 
[01:09:00]  jumping.  Like, it would make it impossible to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.  Right.  But the cost was so ridiculous, they're like, no, we can't build this.  Comes down to money, man.  They could have just put a net around the whole thing.  A net.  Cigarette.  My hair.  You know, my hair.  I told you don't touch my hair.  I jumped in the net and it messed up my hair.  You didn't call me, Tony. 
[01:09:30]  Well, come back here.  Come here.  But the interesting thing about this film, it's obvious that they want to just keep this  quiet.  Like, this is happening.  Yeah.  You know, they know it.  The bridge police or patrol, they know it's happening.  But they're like, all right, just fish the body out of the water.  Let's move on.  And we got a lot of bridges here in New York.  I'm sure it's happening in New York.  Because you hear about it, though, you hear about it, but usually it's some ass that climbs  up there, keeps the police at bay for eight hours while you sit in traffic because this  dummy, it won't get down or won't jump. 
[01:10:00]  You know what?  One or the other.  I bet you.  Holds the police at bay.  I'm talking like Elliot Ness.  It really bugged me.  He held the police at bay.  He's on the lam now.  I am an ass.  I bet you that if there's no witnesses when these people jump, they just, like, hide  it.  Hide it from the media.  I bet you there's so many people jumping.  In New York?  I guarantee.  How are you hiding it in this city? 
[01:10:30]  In the middle of the night?  You could jump.  Who's going to know except for the NYPD?  But everybody knows.  There'd be an NYPD guy on.  Everyone knows because the news reads the blotter.  They read what goes on.  They say a guy.  And then they got to close down the frigging.  No, that's what I'm saying.  The bridge to do an investigation.  I'm saying there's a way around that.  All right.  They don't want this coming out.  I'm with Opie on this.  Talk to an expert.  How many bridges in this fine city?  75.  We got 800 bridges.  There's a lot that we never go over. 
[01:11:00]  We got one, two, three, four on the east side.  We got one on the west side.  We got five bridges.  Five big ones.  Five big ones.  And then we got the little one to Retard Island.  No one cares how many bridges we got.  We got a lot.  Let's go.  Retard Island.  We're festivus.  We're going to get the statistics on how many people jumped off the New York ones.  How many, though?  Do you hear about it a lot?  Yeah.  I'd say in the last year that I've been back in Manhattan, I think maybe two or three,  why I've been working.  Two or three, though, in a year with this many bridges doesn't equal. 
[01:11:30]  Way more than that.  How much do you want to bet?  Yeah, way more.  I will bet you.  You got an easy hundred.  Easy hundred dollar bet.  I'll bet you a hundred bucks that.  I say more than ten.  The whole city.  More than ten.  Wait a minute.  I was going to bet that it's not more than San Francisco.  Oh, well, that's probably obvious.  Because they had said in this movie that.  That's kind of, that is weird to me.  But they said in the movie, the Golden Gate Bridge, for some reason, has become the place  to kill yourself.  And the whole world. 
[01:12:00]  Because it's a tourist drive.  And that's why they want to keep it.  The whole world.  That's why they want to keep it quiet.  The Brooklyn Bridge isn't good enough.  Because it will become a thing to do.  The hell.  It has become the place to kill yourself.  Is it because of the height?  Maybe our bridge is a little too low.  Yeah, you might.  You might actually live.  You might survive and be paralyzed.  You're just paralyzed in a bed.  You wake up and go, this is heaven?  Oh, it's not.  It's because it's easier to get to by foot.  By foot.  You can't.  I don't think it's hard to get to the Washington.  I mean, George Washington, you have to go into Harlem.  And that's kind of you. 
[01:12:30]  You might as well just get killed there.  You got to get on ramps to get onto the.  You might get killed before you get to the bridge.  Yeah.  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm trying to kill myself.  Don't shoot me.  Wait.  Whoa, hold on you.  All right.  Here's the deal.  The phones.  A lot of activity on the phones today.  Saw a guy jump when I was a kid.  Brother lived with guy who jumped off bridge.  Saw a girl jump off bridge and live.  They don't talk about this because it causes more people to do it.  People jump off bridges here.  Copycat.  They call it copycat. 
[01:13:00]  Any video of people changing their mind.  They have a video of a rescue.  But then they show the same girl back there again.  And they rescued her again.  Oh, you ruined it.  Huh?  Not really.  Ruined.  The movie is a great watch.  But the music, it's like stop.  Stop with the sad music.  Well, it's that piano.  Just the generic piano music that could be used during a special Olympics documentary.  Like we said in the back office.  Benny Hill music. 
[01:13:30]  Flavor of love.  Yeah.  It would have been great.  Except Benny Hill music.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Show them jump and then in fast motion backwards.  They're back up, down, up.  The long side of the bridge where they have the whole bridge in focus.  And then hold up.  I can't take it anymore.  Bouncing off the water. 
[01:14:00]  Suspended there.  What's the long shot of the Golden Gate Bridge?  Keystone cops chasing them. 
[01:14:30]  Jesus.  I'm going to take a nice serious subject and just turn it to baby crap.  You know someone's going to do that though.  Someone's going to put it on YouTube.  Just a bunch of people.  Backwards and forwards.  We should do that.  We should do that.  Why not?  We got the movie.  Look how funny this movie can be made.  One of the most tragic things can be made this funny.  How to make this funny.  We got the movie montage with Benny Hill music. 
[01:15:00]  Who wants to take the project on?  Forward and backwards.  Where's Sam?  Different speeds.  Ixnay on what we're about to do A.  It'll be on YouTube in a day or two.  Sam.  Thumbs up?  Montage with Benny Hill music?  All right.  All right.  You mentioned it to the director.  What director?  Don't talk to the director about it.  Yeah.  I'm sure the director won't be upset that we're redoing his work.  We're just kidding.  Wink.  Yeah, it's a joke.  Of course it is.  We would never do anything like that. 
[01:15:30]  Do it immediately.  Never.  But the Golden Gate Bridge, completely in focus.  You know, the whole bridge.  Yeah.  Long shot.  And then they just show a splash.  That looks like a car went off the side.  That's how big this splash is from a human body.  Big splash.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got the girl that was in our TV commercial coming in.  Yeah, I can't read it now.  Somebody called in earlier and said she's really hot.  Yeah.  The guy really liked her.  We'll talk to the director of the bridge. 
[01:16:00]  And we got a guy from the film that did jump and he did survive.  How does that happen?  The creepiest thing he said, as soon as he jumped, he was like, I want to live.  And then had to realize that.  Oh, no.  He had to realize that for four to seven seconds, he estimated.  Four to seven seconds.  He said, as soon as he jumped, he's like, I want to live.  I bet they all do that.  Jesus Christ.  I bet most of them do that.  Right.  I bet most of them do that.  Oh, this was a bad idea.  I know what he said.  He goes, I guess he was falling head first. 
[01:16:30]  And he goes, I want to live.  So somehow he goes, I try to get my body so I would land on my feet.  I figured that would be the best shot of living.  He actually, for four to seven seconds, was like, all right, get my body in such a way where I might survive this.  Like a stuntman.  He knows how to fall.  It took a split second.  For him to realize, no way, I don't want to die, and it's too late.  He already jumped.  And then he estimated he went under 40 to 50 feet.  Didn't know which way was up.  Kind of saw a light finally and started swimming his, you know, water off. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  Let him tell us.  I want to hear him tell us.  Please, Louganis, help me land smoothly.  All right.  We'll have him on the show today, too.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I already said it.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Tuchel's Santana.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show, which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's, we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer. 
[01:17:30]  Tourette's been drawn into a new radical disorder.  Tourette's by involuntary stick and repeated vocalization.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com.  That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself.  One ticket at a time.  Do-do.  Huh? 
[01:18:00]  Tourette's Day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Very busy morning.  We got Krista from our TV commercial.  She stopped by to say hi.  We haven't seen her since we filmed the TV commercial.  No.  You can check out the Opie and Anthony TV commercial on, of course, YouTube.  And all over the TV.  Yeah, the Opie and Anthony Halloween Party is brought to you by Saw 3. 
[01:18:30]  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere October 27th.  We're going to have more details on our Halloween Party, I guess, next week finally, okay?  It's going to be very, very, very good.  It's going to be a tough ticket, though.  I think they're going to give them away a different way this year.  What's going on?  What are you showing, Anthony?  I should know never to look at any comedian's phone when they say, look at this picture.  Nice!  Opie says nice.  It's a big one.  We were just talking about that.  I got something cooking in my oven. 
[01:19:00]  That is...  I got something cooking in my oven.  Is that your home toilet?  No, that's on the road.  That's on the road?  That's a road one.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure that must have been difficult to...  This actually...  I actually had to change rooms because of this.  I had to change rooms.  I flushed, and it's just everywhere.  I'm sure it wasn't at the Shirley Bowling Alley.  You had to get in there with the snake.  I get excited when mine looks like a lizard's tail.  Oh.  An iguana. 
[01:19:30]  An iguana.  Yeah, there you go.  Nice relaxing taper.  All right.  We got the director from The Bridge.  He's here.  Eric Steele.  We'll get him in a few minutes.  Let's see.  We talked about the Mets losing last night.  We got the Cardinals and Tigers in the World Series.  Go Tigers, go.  What else?  Sting says today's music is boring.  Yeah, I saw that yesterday.  Who plays that stupid lute?  I saw that yesterday and just was beside myself.  Come again.  Stupid sting. 
[01:20:00]  To talking about today.  Whether you like today's music or not is one thing.  But to be a 50-something-year-old guy, how old is he now?  55?  Uh, he's got to be probably, wow, yeah, you know what?  The 55-year-old singer, yeah.  It is 55.  He's 55.  Wow.  For 55-year-old singer, anybody 55 years old, really, to comment on what teens are listening to today,  today's music, teens, early 20s, things like that. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, but you don't expect it from a musician.  Sting has become his father.  Yeah, I know.  Like, usually musicians stay hip pretty late in their life and they can understand that music changes  and it goes through this, like, evolution or whatever.  For him to not like it is one thing.  That's fine.  There are plenty of songs I don't like.  I don't like this whole emo thing.  It stinks to me.  Obviously, people do.  I'm not going to sit there and call things boring.  I'm not a fan of the genre they call emo.  I think it's stupid. 
[01:21:00]  But some of the bands are pretty cool.  Yeah.  And some of the things they're singing are pretty cool.  On a whole, it's kind of embarrassing that there's this movement called emo.  But to call today's rock music a bore.  Really?  When you get up on stage with a lute and play music from the 1500s, that is boring.  I don't care who you are.  That is boring. 
[01:21:30]  Bore fest.  We got a little sting on the lute.  Stink.  Could you play the one where it goes, come again?  To die.  Jesus.  It's the hit single.  Rock music has come to a standstill, he says.  It's not going forward anymore.  It only bores me.  Die Zeit, quoted Stink as saying.  Nice magazine newspaper.  Die Zeit.  From Germany.  From Germany.  Everything they have, even their newspaper name, sounds like something that Jews should just 
[01:22:00]  run from.  Right.  Die Zeit.  Ah!  Die Zeit!  Damn, I was just asking if you wanted ice cream.  This little die and wonderful language, German.  Stink said, contemporary rock music is so stagnant that he prefers to sing 16th century English  ballads.  You prefer to sing it.  No one prefers to hear it.  They want to hear Roxanne, you self-centered idiot. 
[01:22:30]  Couldn't think of another word, self-centered, egotistical.  Oh, that was pretty good, though.  Self-serving.  Idiot's good.  I like the idiot.  Keep going.  Yeah, the former teacher who shot to fame as lead singer.  They got to put this in.  Who shot to fame as lead singer, bassist, and composer of the 70s and 80s band Police.  The Police.  He was?  He was in that band?  Told German newspaper.  Die Zeit!  Ah!  That he prefers singing songs of Elizabethan luteinist and composer John Dowland to the 
[01:23:00]  rock music of today.  This John Dowland wouldn't have been known by anybody.  His bones are gone.  That's how long ago this guy died.  Dust is rolling over in its grave that Sting is out there with a lute.  Yeah, he's pretty much erased from, like, history at this point.  Give me enough time there.  E-Rock, you got the song?  They're all arguing.  What happened?  We don't have that one.  We have Message in a Bottle. 
[01:23:30]  We don't want Message in a Bottle.  No, Message in a Bottle is too good for his crap music.  We had him on a disc.  It's crap, but it's still too good.  We're not done with the Sting thing.  I want Sting and his stupid lute in front of me every day so we can go to it when we  want.  Does Sting play the lute, or does he have somebody?  Sting has a luteness that tours with him.  So he doesn't play the lute.  But he also plays the bass lute.  The bass lute.  The bass lute.  He was taught by the luteness to play the bass lute so they can both play together. 
[01:24:00]  And then he sings.  So he has a bass lute, and the other guy has a lute.  Has a lute.  The luteness has a lute.  See, I'm kind of bummed at E-Rock.  And someone should just beat him over the head with a lute.  E-Rock.  You've got to be thinking.  Of course we're going to go back to Sting and the lute.  Oh, boy.  See, when an article comes out that says that Sting hates today's music, you've got to be  smart enough to realize Open End are going to want an example of what Sting's doing today.  Did you get that email yesterday, E-Rock?  That's true. 
[01:24:30]  Did E-Rock get the email yesterday?  That's true.  I sent it out pretty early.  Did you get it?  Yeah, it's 2 o'clock.  Huh?  I got his thing at 2 o'clock this week.  So we're on at 6.  What's the problem?  Well, that's four hours.  Being that it was an XM recording, I thought it would be.  Oh, he just shuts his mic off and lets him ramble.  Wow.  Wow.  Sometimes I understand it's hard to try to figure out what we want on this show, but  that's an obvious one.  You're right, E-Rock.  We're obsessed with Sting and the stupid lute.  And when there's an article where he's trashing today's music, me as a radio guy goes, well, 
[01:25:00]  this would be a place where we should play what he's doing today.  Yeah, his crappy lute.  And make a quick comparison.  You realize, oh, my God, this is awful.  What is he talking about?  E-Rock's a smug, unfunny douche.  All right.  Well, that Sting's story would have been a lot better if we could give you a little of  his luteing, but it ain't happening today.  Smug.  Smug lute hater.  It ain't happening today.  That's too bad.  And then I was all looking forward to hearing it. 
[01:25:30]  I haven't heard it.  Oh, God.  How's the lute sound?  Oh, it's horrible.  How does it lute?  How does it go?  It sounds like you'd expect a 1500s instrument to sound.  Hey, we get boring.  Is it a guitar slash organ?  Is that what it is?  It's like a little guitar ukulele.  You know, it's like shaped like a guitar that a guy with curly shoes and like a court jester  outfit would wear.  And then the neck of the guitar, because it's a guitar, just goes left really hard. 
[01:26:00]  Hard left.  90 degree left turn at the top of the neck.  That's a lute.  It's a lute.  Because they thought back then if they made it straight, somehow they'd fall off the edge  of the earth.  It might as well be a harp.  Very smart.  It's a harp if the harp was almost cool.  The harp isn't cool anymore?  Hey, we can still save this bit.  The instrument that was made when they were burning people for being witches.  Really?  How good could it be?  We're going to dunk you under the water for 15 minutes if you come up and live. 
[01:26:30]  You're innocent.  Is someone going to XM to get that song?  All right.  See, we can still save the bit.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Priest denies having sex with Foley.  Admits relationship, though.  The Mark Foley thing?  Yeah.  Holy crap.  I guess he blames it on a priest back in the day.  What else are you going to do?  That used to massage him and take saunas with him nude.  Did you read this stuff in the paper today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else is he going to do? 
[01:27:00]  He's got to say that.  What is the priest saying?  Ah, come on.  Let bygones be bygones.  What's wrong?  Listen to this.  We had a little fun back in the day.  Get a steam room.  What's that under your towel game?  Come on.  You know why this priest is admitting all this stuff?  He's on a small island off of Italy.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, he's hiding.  So he's fine.  And in a communique from this small island off Italy, an elderly priest acknowledged Thursday  that he was naked in saunas with Mark Foley decades ago when the former congressman was 
[01:27:30]  a boy in Florida.  Mark Foley's going to visit him and stab him in the stomach and rip him up to his chest.  Antonio Andolini.  He's in the sauna.  Please, God.  Please, God.  Oh, the sauna with the priest.  Oh, am I in trouble now?  Oh, Jesus.  But he denies...  Hey, why don't you slide over here, young Foley?  Who's that?  The young Foley boy's coming in.  Father, is that you?  It's so foggy. 
[01:28:00]  Come over here, my son.  What's that?  Sit down.  Oh, you don't need that pesky towel.  I keep these benches well sanded.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, I'm going to preach to you about the Lord Jesus.  The Lord Jesus.  You want to hear about this creep or what?  Of course we do.  All right.  It's the priest from a small island off Italy.  The Lord said unto the... 
[01:28:30]  Okay, now leave.  Remember, this is a secret.  God grant me this.  I would love to play Priest by Stephen Lynch.  We used to play it in the old days.  Yeah.  But the FCC is out there to ruin everything.  So just imagine how bad that song is.  Under the gun.  Father Anthony Murcia admits he had intimate contact with a teenage Mark Foley,  but says whether it was abuse depends on how you look at it. 
[01:29:00]  Abuse, it's a bad word, you know.  Because abuse, you abuse someone against his will.  This priest is nuts.  He's just saying, hey, the kid was asking for it.  The kid was 13.  I mean, Mark Foley's now the creep, but Mark Foley was a 13-year-old boy,  and this guy is like...  Made him a creep.  ...saying that the word abuse is a bad word.  Mamma mia, huh?  You police.  That's an error.  It's a fault. 
[01:29:30]  This spontaneousness, you know.  But anyway, whatever it was, you know.  See, everything is molestation, I guess.  And that's what happened.  This guy's yapping because, like you said, he's just on some island somewhere.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  Because it just goes to show you how different this country is.  First of all, you wouldn't hear a peep out of this guy.  You'd hear his lawyer going, well, these allegations, we're looking into them,  but obviously they're false, and this is something that... 
[01:30:00]  He's just an upstanding citizen.  And this guy's like, hey, mamma mia, sure, I play with his gnocchi.  Who cares?  What the...  He must be on an island like the island in Kong.  Yeah.  Well-protected.  Kong Island.  Skull Island.  Skull Island.  There you go.  Yeah, Skull Island.  Michael Jackson living there, too.  That's why he's talking.  So cocky.  They all look at these islands.  Yeah.  So cocky.  Well, it depends on how you look at it.  His fusilli was steaming.  He was asking for it.  You call abuse, that means something else. 
[01:30:30]  It is not abuse.  I call it...  It's a relationship.  Love, maybe.  I love...  You see, if it was abuse, it would have been like overcooked ziti.  But both of us very al dente.  It means both of us enjoy each other company.  It means both soft, hard at the same time.  Just right.  Al dente.  To the tooth.  Yeah.  The tooth.  It means literally the tooth, which I never enjoyed, so I sent him on his way because 
[01:31:00]  I don't like the teeth.  So I got other people.  Not abuse.  What America calls this crazy, but you take a steam together.  Come on.  You want to take your clothes off?  Put camera down.  I show you.  Put microphone down.  Come, have wine.  You take a steam.  You take a steam.  Mama mia.  We got more.  A sick bastard.  Unfortunately, we had a bleep of word over here.  It's so stupid.  It's so stupid.  Let me guess.  Because this is part of CNN.  We got this from CNN. 
[01:31:30]  CNN did it.  But there's different rules for radio than CNN.  Yeah.  It's a news story.  Apparently they're wrong.  Father Murcia, now 69 and retired, lives on the Maltese island of Gozo, near Italy.  Gozo.  He talked by phone with CNN and CNN affiliate WPTV.  Sources familiar with his investigations say he's the Catholic...  Bruce Mark Foley claims molested him as a teen nearly 40 years ago.  Father Murcia told CNN his memory is now a bit fuzzy about one incident. 
[01:32:00]  Of course it is.  So was the kid.  ...might have gone too far when he was mixing tranquilizers and alcohol to treat depression.  Well, then maybe I touched him or so, you know, but it didn't, it wasn't, because then it's not something you call, I mean, rape or f***ing or anything like that, you know.  It was just fun.  It was just touching.  Yeah.  Just touching.  Or, or, or, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:32:30]  I gotta know what that word was.  Something called...  He's admitting to just touching.  Not...  Or...  Not...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, I gotcha.  Wow, you can't use that?  I don't know.  CNN can, but radio can't.  That's so stupid.  It's like, uh, yeah.  Yeah, well...  All right.  I think people can figure it out.  Just touching.  No, actually, because I couldn't.  I'll tell you what, though, pills and alcohol and little boys do help with depression.  Yeah, really.  I thought, I'm here to say that that does work. 
[01:33:00]  It was a prescription doctor wrote for me, and it worked.  You always know how well tranquilizers and the booze work for depression.  Little boys.  They make a movie about it.  It's called The Bridge.  It got me out of my rut last month.  Nice little Filipino boy.  Tranquilizes and alcohol to treat his depression.  Nice.  A source familiar with the investigation tells CNN,  Murcia was assigned to Sacred Heart Church in Lake Worth in the mid-60s. 
[01:33:30]  Foley was an altar boy there.  Murcia says they took trips to New York and Washington.  Oh.  They became more and more friends, almost like brothers.  Father Murcia tells CNN he and Foley went skinny dipping and took saunas, wearing only towels.  Sometimes, he says, he massaged the teen's bare shoulders.  I would say that if I offended him, I am sorry, but to remember the good time we had together, you know. 
[01:34:00]  Ah, just remember the good times.  We enjoyed each other company.  To let bygones be bygones.  Let bygones be bygones.  Let bygones be bygones.  Come on.  What a great kid toucher.  I'm just a molesting priest.  Why?  Forget about it, kid.  Get over it.  Mama mia.  Let the bygones be bygones.  Look, have a cannoli and let the bygones be bygones. 
[01:34:30]  But do espresso and relax.  Hey.  Good espresso.  Yeah.  I give you a back rub.  This guy just doesn't care about it.  Why are you bothering me?  He's safe.  That's why he doesn't care.  I'm on an island.  I'm on an island.  A long time ago.  And finally.  Foley's attorneys have no comment on what the priest said.  The Catholic Church says it will investigate whether Murcia allegedly abused Foley and anyone else. 
[01:35:00]  We offer counseling to both the alleged victim and the alleged abuser.  We will do an independent review board investigation.  Sure, that's in-depth.  Father Murcia says that's just what his former so-called brother needs.  Anyway, it's so well overcome it.  Mark is a very intelligent man, you know.  His attorney says Foley won't press criminal charges.  And unless another alleged victim asks the Palm Beach State Attorney to investigate, 
[01:35:30]  a spokesman says that office won't open a criminal case.  Nah, they're not getting this guy.  No.  I gotta tell you, man.  Brought up Catholic.  It's time for female priests.  Because every once in a while I'll be in a church and I can't think of anything else.  I look at these priests up there and they might even be great guys that have served the community for 50 years.  But all you think is all the stuff you've heard over the last 10 years.  Blasphemy.  Actually, no more. 
[01:36:00]  My grandmother's telling me there's no more altar boys in the Catholic Church.  They just bring in any.  You never see an altar boy helping out the priest.  What parent would serve up their supple little child to that?  Come here.  I want you to put this blush on.  Just serve a lip gloss.  You get those lips nice and shiny.  You hear me?  Lip gloss.  I can't get anything done in the church because I look up and I'm like, yeah, look at him.  Oh, boy.  How many did he touch?  And he's probably a great guy.  He probably served God.  I'm a great guy.  I can't get it past the fact that all of them have to be creeps now. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  All of them.  I just think it's odd to take a job that one of the prerequisites are that you cannot have sex.  Yeah, it's time to lose that.  It's a little odd that that's part of your job description because what it would attract are people that have repressed sexuality either because they're just odd.  Because it's human nature to want to have sex or because they're gay, don't want to accept it, so they go into an occupation that takes sex out of the picture. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  But then they get these urges and before you know it, you're on an island off of Italy going, hey, bygones.  Happy bygones.  Bygones.  He's a ziti.  Al dente.  Al dente.  Sometimes a little overcooked.  I had a, in rehab, I had a gay priest.  He wasn't, you can't, you know, he's a priest, so how could he be gay?  How could he be a kid toucher? 
[01:37:30]  But he's just, you know, this guy who was like, hello, Robert.  And it's like, dude, you're gay.  You're just gay.  Your gaydar detector went off.  No, I'm not gay.  Yes, you are, dude.  Just fess.  Just fess up.  And you're working at a rehab with all boys.  And you're the overnight guy.  So he's the guy that, oh, you'd hear him at the bedside of some little kid.  What did he do to you?  Nothing to me.  And by some little kid you mean.  I was never that lucky.  You mean.  We got to take a break, but really fast.  Ben from Pennsylvania. 
[01:38:00]  Opie, get real.  Foley's group paid this guy to agree with his story.  Safe because, you know, they're not going to prosecute.  Like they made a little deal to help him out.  It's too late for Foley.  It's possible.  It's too late, though.  And then someone's wondering.  It's more probable that this happened than it didn't.  Someone is wondering if he would like the Dateline cookies.  The Italian version of Dateline with this guy would be really good.  What are you here for?  I'm Chris Hansen.  With Dateline NBC. 
[01:38:30]  Do it with an Italian accent, though.  Chris Hansen.  What, the Chris Hansen?  Yeah, because he's over in Italy.  It's the Italian version of Dateline.  What are you doing here?  I'm Chris Hansen.  Me?  I just brought lunch for you.  Why are you coming?  Do you know this is a home of a 13-year-old boy?  No, I thought there was a grown woman here.  You said in your emails, you want to take the schvitz with the young boy. 
[01:39:00]  Why did he turn Jewish?  You want to take a steam with the young boy.  I just want to hear the Italian version of sex.  It's almost impossible.  Did you want to have sex?  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  We're so late today.  We're late.  I'm late.  Eric Steele, the director of The Bridge, in studio next.  That's going to be really cool.  Also, a guy that jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and survived.  He's calling in around 830.  Wow. 
[01:39:30]  Hopefully.  Hopefully before he jumps and tries it again.  That would be great for our show.  And then the girl from our TV commercial here.  Did you just say that?  What happened?  You said you hope he'll get a home before he jumps again.  I know.  Got to live through it and probably moved on with his life, and there you are.  Yeah, but you know.  No.  I'm going to try to push him over the edge.  Of course you are.  We need some press for this stupid show.  No, I'm just kidding.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.

And now, here's a little beat.  Let's get right back into the show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Bob Kelly in studio for Jim Norton, who's in San Francisco.  And now we got Jeffrey Ross in studio.  How you doing?  He's going to be at Caroline's this weekend, right?  I am, man.  Very good.  And also, we've been talking about this movie all morning long. 
[01:41:00]  We got Eric Steele sitting on the couch.  The director of The Bridge.  Good morning, Eric.  Sounds intense.  Huh?  The movie sounds very intense.  I saw it last night, and it's kind of weird to say, but I love the movie.  I don't know why.  Maybe you shouldn't use the word love, but it was fascinating.  It was interesting.  Well, it's a subject matter that hasn't been really covered that personally. 
[01:41:30]  I think people are really scared of suicide, so show them that in.  Yikes.  Yeah, and it was like, you know, you got personal with these people.  You got to know them, because you kind of backtracked, obviously.  You can't predict the future and talk to families before this happens.  So, basically, the film shows people jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge.  Yeah.  And I would gather you then went and researched who these people were, talked to their families.  Yeah, we went to the coroner's office and got information from the coroner, and then just 
[01:42:00]  did a lot of private detective work and found people every which way we could.  Found people willing to talk, because I'm sure not all the families wanted to talk on film.  Yeah, not all of them.  In the beginning, most of them really were very cooperative.  But then, I think over time, it probably got harder for them.  Yeah.  The unique thing, though, is how you took it then and did the interviews first.  Showed the interviews first on the film.  So, you make a feel for these people, Eric. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Then, you know who these people are and what their story is.  Yeah, when we were at the bridge and we saw this happen, they were strangers to us.  But, obviously, when we put the film together, we wanted them to be real people first.  Yeah.  You see them die and you really care for them.  Makes it a lot more difficult to watch.  By the way, bravo for not pussing out.  You show them jumping.  Absolutely.  And then, you don't pull the camera away.  You try to follow them all the way to the water.  I was convinced, like, okay, they're going to maybe show them start the jump and then cut to, like, a seagull or something. 
[01:43:00]  I don't know.  But they didn't puss out in this movie.  I think I auditioned for this.  It's on relief for them.  Jeffrey Ross.  Jeffrey Ross, everybody.  But you were at the bridge for a year, you were saying, right?  Yeah, we got there, sorry, just before sunrise every day.  And we were there until sundown, rain or shine.  I mean, just with four cameras all the time.  Four cameras rolling for a year straight.  And how many people did you catch jumping?  We saw evidence that 23 people had jumped. 
[01:43:30]  But we knew one more had jumped at night when we weren't filming.  So 24 altogether died.  You think people were jumping when it was a foggy day and no one would know?  Yeah, I mean, the number could be higher.  But you pretty much know of 24 people that jumped in the year 2004 off the Golden Gate Bridge.  Now, how did you get this film by people?  How were you able to film the bridge and all that?  Because we heard there was some kind of controversy where people said it was under false pretense that you went to... 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, if I had gone and said, look, I'm making the movie and waiting to catch people jumping off the bridge,  I think they probably would have tried to stop me.  But I had to apply for permits from the Park Service, and I gave them every indication of what we would be filming.  We were going to be there every day.  We had telephoto lenses.  We were on the east side of the bridge.  Oh, so enough clues were thrown out there like, excuse me.  And they kept coming and looking through our cameras, and they knew the kind of footage we were getting.  And whenever we saw someone climb up onto the rail, we always called them and said, look, someone's getting ready to jump. 
[01:44:30]  Go stop them.  And so they sort of knew.  I mean, I think they're pretending like they didn't know because that's good PR for them.  This was made after 9-11, by the way.  Absolutely, yeah.  You know, when some dumb tourist has a camera and it's pointed at the GWB, they get the SWAT team out.  Yeah, they had National Guard at the bridge the whole first half of the year,  and we kept waiting for them to come and say, what are you guys doing?  But they didn't really care.  Yeah.  So they were sort of like our pals, the National Guard. 
[01:45:00]  Now, about the getting involved in calling for help, you're there doing a documentary of people jumping off the bridge.  Right.  So there has to be that fine line between, hey, we do want to catch what we came here to film,  but we're humans, kind of got to get involved in maybe helping this guy out.  What did you feel your job was as far as trying to save these people by making the phone calls,  if you saw them milling around?  And I guess after a while you would realize, okay, this guy's going to jump. 
[01:45:30]  You'd kind of catch the vibe?  It was kind of hard to tell.  I mean, you know.  Even after a year?  Yeah.  I mean, if you made a profile of what someone was going to look like before they jumped to the death,  you'd always be wrong.  But, I mean, like the first guy I saw was just some guy in a jogging suit, and he was laughing on his cell phone.  And, you know, there he is talking, and then he hangs up his phone and…  Probably his ex-wife.  Yeah.  His boss.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You.  Probably talking to Verizon.  Hey, did most people just boom, boom, jump right off? 
[01:46:00]  They knew what they would do?  Or did most people hesitate?  Kind of do it?  It's sort of like, you know, two groups.  I mean, there are some people who just walk right up, and they climb over, and they go.  And then there's other people who climb over, and they hang out on that rail for quite a long time.  So now those are the people that I'm thinking…  We called, whenever we saw, you know, someone climb up onto the rail, our first thing that we did was call in for help.  I mean, if they didn't stay for very long on the rail, our calls didn't make a difference.  But if they were there, I mean, we helped to save six people's lives.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Whose number did you have, and how quickly did the people that you called get to the scene? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, originally we just dialed 911, which was a big mistake, because then they'd transfer you.  That's a lot.  They'd put you on hold.  Forget it.  Forget about it.  Yeah.  But then we got the actual number of the bridge district, you know, their little highway patrol office, and we called them directly.  And usually they came out pretty quick, but, you know, quick is relative when, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, once we called, and there was some guy sitting on the rail for four and a half minutes before they got there. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  Are there people on the bridge stationed, like their job is to patrol the bridge?  Yeah, they ride back and forth on bicycles.  All day long.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's like a few of them, and it's a two-mile bridge.  It's a big bridge, yeah.  So you're really not, you know, going to…  Yeah, if you're in the wrong place, wrong time.  And if you're going to kill yourself, you know about that, so you're just waiting for the guy to ride to the other side and, you know.  Yeah, they're pretty smart.  I mean, these people, if they really want to avoid being caught, they can.  Right.  The thing I wanted to ask you about also is the flares.  And I see if somebody jumps shortly after there's a flare thrown in the water, I guess, to, you know, track the current and stuff. 
[01:47:30]  Who does this?  Yeah, the current's really tricky under the bridge.  So in order to find the body, the only way they can sort of guesstimate where it would be is to throw the flare in.  And it's just, they're usually like the iron workers or the highway patrolmen throw the flares in.  Really?  Because they're painting the bridge all the time, you know, to keep it from being rusty.  It isn't some type of thing that's just meant for a suicide where they have a flare?  Oh, yeah, that's what the flares are for.  It's what the flares are for.  Are they put in, like, in case of suicide break glass cases or do certain people have them? 
[01:48:00]  I'm just…  It's in their back pocket.  I'm kind of, like, curious as to who has these things.  I imagine they just carry them around in their little toolboxes.  Yeah.  Hey, what was going through your mind when you saw these people jump?  That's got to be just horrific.  I mean, to see it on film is horrific, but to be looking through a camera and watching this happen in real time has got to be just unbelievable.  Yeah, it's a little bit…  I mean, one of the guys in the film that we showed, he was a photographer on the bridge one day, 
[01:48:30]  and he was just taking pictures, and all of a sudden he saw this girl climb over.  And it took him a minute or two to realize what was actually going on.  And he said it was like being a National Geographic photographer and a lion's coming at you, and you don't quite know what to do.  Do you keep taking pictures, or do you, like, jump up and…  It's like, wow, this is great.  Look, I'm getting a close-up of a lion.  And it's a little bit that you feel like it just can't really be happening.  Like, there's no way that these people are really going to do this.  And then, you know, that minute, that second of disbelief, it just, like, gets shattered, and you're like, oh, my God. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  But it was…  I mean, if you watch the footage really carefully, like, most of the time we don't really…  It's not like we have these beautiful, you know, tilts down watching these people jump,  because it's so shocking that we usually stood up or we were screaming or, you know, trying to call and get help.  I mean, it happened so fast that the shots aren't…  Oh, the camera work isn't smooth.  It's not like watching golf on TV where they follow the ball nicely.  It's like, oh, my God, you're trying to focus.  But that's what I think is very effective in this film. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like…  I mean, and we tried to make the film a little bit like what we felt.  You know, it's like bearing witness to these things.  It's just not easy.  Yeah.  So you never got used to…  It never…  Every time you saw it, it still shocked you, like, the first time.  Yeah.  I mean, there are nights when I still wake up thinking about it.  Eesh.  How much do they hate you in San Francisco?  Yeah, I'm not a big fan.  I mean, they're not a big fan of me.  Well, because I think they wanted to keep this secret, because it turns out I was doing  some research on the Internet.  It's up to, like, 1,200-plus people that have jumped since 1937. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, some people say 1,200.  Some people say it could be 2,000.  But, you know, they just don't want to put up a barrier, and so…  Why is that?  They don't got the right design, and it's funds, money.  Yeah, and really, I think it has something to do with they just don't care.  I mean, you know, they put up a barrier in between the roadway and the pedestrian walkway,  but there's never been a pedestrian killed by a car on the bridge,  and they have one of those movable median barriers, you know, that they want to put up on the bridge,  but there hasn't really been a head-on collision on the Golden Gate Bridge, 
[01:50:30]  so they're protecting people who aren't really at risk,  but the people who seem to be dying there all the time, they don't want to do anything.  Any reason, like, all the documentaries that people have made and can make,  you've decided, hey, here's a cheery little subject I'm going to tackle?  You know, yeah, people ask me that.  I guess I watched the World Trade Center fall from my window,  and I was very aware of the people who jumped out of the building rather than die in the inferno,  and so I guess when I read that the Golden Gate Bridge was the most popular suicide destination, 
[01:51:00]  something sort of clicked, and I thought, well, these people are, you know,  trying to jump out of their own inferno, and that's sort of what started the whole thing going,  and then this idea that, you know, all suicides, or almost all of them,  take place behind closed doors where you never see them,  and here was a group, you know, pretty regularly, you know,  people were walking out in broad daylight on a national monument in front of, you know,  like strangers and tourists and taking their life.  Yeah, you know the time and place.  It's like turning something inside out. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  It's a place where it's going to happen.  Watching last night, I was on the edge of my seat because you follow people,  and you're like, is this going to be one of the jumpers?  And then it turns out, like, that's just a tourist, you know, looking over the side,  and you're like, and then you start breathing again, like, okay.  But then you see the other side of it where you're looking at a guy like,  there's no way this is going to be one, and sure enough,  he just makes that quick move to get over the edge and jumps like that.  Yeah, I mean, it was like that every day.  I mean, we watched really thousands of people,  and every single time you saw someone walking alone, your heart is going, 
[01:52:00]  you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah, it's really hard.  Why the Golden Gate Bridge?  Why do they pick the bridge?  Yeah.  Do you know anything about that?  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, it's a beautiful place.  You know, the sort of the metaphor of, you know, this, you know, the end of the world  and crossing over and, you know, like, I think that probably plays into it.  But to me, it seems the reason they pick it is, well, two, one, the railing is so low.  You know, I mean, a seven-year-old could climb over that railing.  And then the other part is I think it's in public, and there is that possibility if someone sees you, they're going to grab you and yank you back. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, people shouldn't be confused.  This isn't people committing suicide in the San Francisco area.  People make plans from, like, Houston, all over the – I don't know all over the world, but all over the country, certainly.  Yeah, there was a guy we interviewed.  He came from Germany.  Do you think people would kill themselves anyway if there was a railing?  I don't know.  You can't stop all of them maybe, but –  But, I mean, would they do something else?  Do you think these people are suicidal or is it the bridge that draws them? 
[01:53:00]  I think they are suicidal, but, you know, if you can get them through that period where things are really, really rough and, you know, they get through that lowest of the low period, then maybe they'll be all right.  But, you know, the bridge is just so easy, and I think that's part of the appeal.  Were there any people that jumped?  Like, did they ever jump in front of other people, like, you know, like a family of six walking down?  Oh, yeah.  And then some guy just goes, phoomp, and you –  Yeah, we interviewed a family from Los Angeles, and their five-year-old son was watching.  Oof.  So – 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I saw that part in the office earlier today.  Yeah, family just, you know, taking pictures, and now that kid's got to have that memory in his head of a person jumping off the bridge.  The creepiest thing, and I didn't even pick up on it at first, and I'm saying this just in case people go see the bridge, when you have those long shots at the Golden Gate Bridge, I wasn't thinking anything of it.  And then all of a sudden I'm like, was that a splash?  And I had to rewind and go, oh, my God.  Yeah.  And the splash is as big as if a car went over the side of the bridge, just a massive splash. 
[01:54:00]  But if you're not looking for it, I'm just assuming it's a setup shot for whatever in the movie.  But, no, it's another person jumped that obviously you didn't catch with the zoom lens.  Right.  Yeah, they were actually doing a promo for the new X-Men movie in San Francisco a while back, and, you know, they had all these cameras running, and all the movie stars were standing in Crissy Field, and all of a sudden there was this big splash behind them, and they were like, oh, my God, what is that?  And someone said, yeah, someone else jumped off the bridge.  This happens all the time. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh.  They caught pretty much 24 in a year.  How many since 2004?  I think it was a little less in 2005, and I don't know what the number is so far in 2006.  It's about the same every year, though.  That's odd.  So it was you and some other guy in a room just doing this.  No, we were outside.  Outside doing this all day.  Yeah.  We had a crew of 10 people, so you sort of rotated shifts, you know.  Like a stakeout?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Under, we had tents and tarps and all these cameras.  Did you go drink after a day of filming? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, we had, like, pizza night and bowling night and stuff like that for the crew.  About once.  Are you haunted at night?  Mm.  I mean, I guess the most haunting footage isn't even so much the people jumping off.  It's when you see someone climb up on the rail, and then all of a sudden, you know, like,  guys are jogging by or riding their bikes by, and they turn around and look, and they're  like, no, I'm not going to stop.  Yeah, yeah.  That part scares me more.  That's a little odd.  But how many of us would really, like, you know, risk our own lives?  I don't know.  I could pull you over with them? 
[01:55:30]  Not so much risking your life.  You don't have to, you know, grab the person, but you can stop and maybe say something.  I would like to think I'm that guy, but I don't know.  You'd have to stop and say something.  You're a do-gooder.  Next thing you know, he's stronger than you and pulls you over with him or something.  I'm not talking about grabbing him.  Just stopping and trying something.  And say, you know, maybe it's the fear that you're going to talk, and they're going to  jump, and then you're going to be like, maybe it's what I said, you know?  Yeah, but it might be, too, that you go, hey, dude, don't.  And he goes, I'm not stupid. 
[01:56:00]  I'm just looking over the edge.  I'm a painter, you idiot.  Yeah, you relax, ass.  All this orange paint.  Then you feel like, you know, I'm just, I'm sorry.  You know, it's like, you know, trying to help.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think that's it, though, because you just see him kind of glance.  Yeah, they just sort of glance at him and go, I don't know.  I don't care.  There's a guy hanging over the side, and the guy just runs by.  By the way, the ending of the film is great.  I won't give it away, although you can figure out what happens.  Actually, one guy flies.  Now that would be a hell of an ending.  And then the other thing, talking to the guy that survived. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, Kevin.  Kevin.  He's supposed to call the show today.  Yeah, he's great.  It was unbelievable.  He said in the film, as soon as he jumped, he knew, I want to live.  And then he just tried to figure out how he was going to try to land,  so maybe he survives the thing.  How many feet down is it, like 25 stories?  Yeah, 225 feet from the middle.  And he explains in detail what he was thinking, what happened when he hit the water, everything.  Oh, boy.  That is high. 
[01:57:00]  We could get him on the show after the break.  Okay.  Why don't we do that?  We'll give him a call and see what he's all about.  It's Eric Steele, the director of The Bridge.  Opens next Friday?  Opens on the 27th, yeah.  The 27th, next Friday.  Everywhere or just in little art theaters?  New York, San Francisco, L.A., Chicago.  Not just art theaters.  I mean, they're...  So San Francisco is saying, okay, you could show this film here?  Well, yeah, I mean, the city doesn't have any control over it.  Yeah, good point.  Do you fight in the UFC on your off time?  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:57:30]  Jesus, you're jacked.  Protection.  One of the death threats I got in San Francisco.  Wow.  By the way, really fast, the Opin' Anthony Halloween Party is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere, October 27th.  That's my competition.  Hey, I've got to get these things in, Jeffrey.  Yeah, Saw.  That's my competition.  Yeah, well, and we'll have details on our Halloween party next week.  Jeffrey Ross at Carolines and Bob Kelly filling in for Jim Norton.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's the One Virus spreading across America. 
[01:58:00]  Back with the Opin' Anthony show.  The One Virus spreading across America.  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  He's playing Carolines this weekend.  Bob Kelly is here.  Oh, Bob, you've got to do my football picks for this week.  Okay.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  They gave us $10,000.  The person with the most correct picks at the end of the year will win $10,000.  10 Gs?  10 Gs.  And I'm in on it to spoil it for these guys behind the scenes. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  I mean, I'm still in it.  Are you, though?  Really?  Sort of.  All right.  Bob Kelly picked the Jets over the Lions.  Went with the Steelers over the Falcons.  Nope.  Raiders over the Cardinals.  Nope.  Broncos over the Browns.  Yep.  Nope.  Nope.  And he took the Pats over my Bills.  Yeah, of course.  Bills stink.  They do stink this year.  And so does in that city stinks.  All right.  Actually, I like your picks.  I need a big week.  I was two for five last week.  Every single one of them is right.  I'm in third place right now, I do believe. 
[01:59:00]  Eric Steele, the director from The Bridge.  Oh, if they had a bridge in Buffalo like that that they could jump off of.  Oh, my God.  The whole town.  Something like that.  Please.  Hey, hey, hey.  They jump off things and hit puffy snow in July.  You guys are stupid.  What?  They got Niagara Falls.  Yeah, but you can't get to that.  They've done some impressive things with Niagara Falls.  Got to give you that.  I was living up there when Jet Ski Guy went over the falls.  Nice.  Jet Ski Guy?  Jet Ski Guy.  Did they have video of that?  Yes.  No.  Jet Ski Guy over the falls.  Goodbye.  Really? 
[01:59:30]  Yes.  Did he?  Did he?  Yee-haw.  He pretty much gave it a yee-haw.  Wow.  Wow.  Jet Ski Guy.  Beat that, San Francisco.  Did he give it the gas?  Did he really go for it?  What?  Beat that, San Francisco.  That's right.  Putting out the challenge.  Listen, brother, I'm going to put 24 dudes jumping isn't nothing to this.  Yee-haw.  Jet Ski Guy.  Wow.  How cool is that?  That's crazy.  Hey, we got Kevin on the phone here.  Maybe we shouldn't be joking about this as we talk to Kevin, who actually jumped from 
[02:00:00]  the Golden Gate Bridge and survived.  Kevin.  Yes.  Saw the movie last night.  Your story was amazing.  Well, it's only a little tiny bit of my story, but I'm glad to be alive.  I guess.  Wow.  Where do you start here?  What was going on in your life that drove you to that point?  Quite simply, I have a brain disease called bipolar disorder.  My neuroepinephrine levels, my epinephrine levels, my serotonin levels were out of whack.  I was hearing voices, seeing things telling me I had to die. 
[02:00:30]  I was in a great deal of emotional and physical pain because of my bipolar, and I subsequently  walked onto the bridge, stood there for 40 minutes, crying my eyes out, begging myself  not to jump while the bipolar was begging me to jump, and I jumped.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's just wrong.  You had to hit that.  What happened?  My hands are on the chair. 
[02:01:00]  I've never ceased to.  What happened?  That could be the worst timing ever.  I thought I was at the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I know.  I need to chill out a little bit.  Kevin.  So, obviously, it was beyond your control at that point.  It was absolutely beyond my control.  Sit down, Bob.  It's not that bad.  I appreciate the laughter from the other gentlemen, but yeah, it was beyond my control.  Yeah.  You know, it's interesting.  People don't look at brain diseases like mental illness as a problem today. 
[02:01:30]  Sometimes they think it's just all in your head.  You have to get over it and let it go.  Right, right.  It's just not that simple.  How are you feeling today, Kevin?  I feel fabulous.  I'm on the right medications.  I'm on a strict routine so that I cannot fall back into my depression, and I'm doing really  good.  How many times a day do you have to tell the jumping from the bridge story?  You know what?  Not that often. 
[02:02:00]  When I get interviews from people and stuff like that, I tell a little bit of the story,  and I hope that people understand that this is real.  This is not a bunch of baloney.  This is a fact of life, and 50% of the population of America is, on paper, factually mentally ill.  Yeah.  We know by our ratings.  Yeah.  See, now he's laughing at us.  Just read our message boards.  Kevin, I got to ask you because not many people know what that experience is like, and I'm sure 
[02:02:30]  it stands out in your mind as something that had happened to you.  So, if you could walk people through, what is that like from the moment you actually decide?  Don't tell them, Kevin.  Make them watch the movie.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, look at Eric.  You are a director.  Look at Eric.  Your first movie, and you've learned so much.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  You know, can I give you a hint, though?  Yeah.  All right.  Give us a little teaser, then, and then we'll watch the movie. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  When someone wants to commit suicide, it is the worst day of their life entirely because they  look at their life, whether their life was good or bad.  They see the people they've loved in their entire life, and then they can't see anything  but death, and all they want to do is die, and it's not their fault.  They know not what they do.  These are mentally ill people who have to die because of voices in their head, who have  to die because their medications are off, who have to die because they are so sick mentally 
[02:03:30]  that they can't focus on reality.  Some of these people are in such a distorted reality that they believe people are following  them out to get them.  The paranoia levels are huge.  It's just plain scary.  Yeah.  And I'm just going to imagine falling 220 feet at 35 miles an hour and thinking that  today I'm going to die.  It's over.  And it's only four seconds.  You can imagine how traumatic that might be, and then your body is basically just dismantled.  Wow.  I can get you to...  We watched the movie, but my God, it was the worst day of my life, but I am so glad that 
[02:04:00]  I'm still here because I get to meet people like Eric Steele and people like you guys.  Wow.  Do you ever think of a t-shirt?  Like, I jumped and made it.  Yeah, right.  Start selling t-shirts.  I jumped up the Golden Gate Bridge and survived.  Kevin, has it ever got you, you know, some puha?  I'm serious.  You never know.  Kevin's got a really great girlfriend.  You guys got to be careful here.  Oh, all right.  No, I can't get in trouble.  She'll kill me.  All right.  What?  Was she your girlfriend? 
[02:04:30]  Was she your...  That's funny.  Was she your girlfriend before you jumped?  Well, I knew her, but now we have become intimate, and we are madly in love and hope  to get married.  And what do you do for a living now?  I am an activity coordinator, and I am the...  Nothing.  I'm now the recruitment coordinator for high school.  Wow.  He underplays how great he's doing.  Yeah.  I'm doing good.  I can get you an audition for the new Jackass movie if you want to. 
[02:05:00]  You're right.  I'll do anything.  Kevin, are you the only one that jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and is alive to tell  about it?  No, you know what?  There are actually 28 folks that are alive.  I was the 26th, apparently.  You have to understand, a lot of these people can't even walk.  There's a very small number of that 28 that are perfectly capable of walking, running,  and that kind of thing.  I am one of those, probably about four or five guys that can do that, or girls. 
[02:05:30]  It's just, you know, less than 1% have survived.  1,500 people today have died off that bridge.  Every 15 days, someone dies off that bridge.  Every four days, somebody attempts.  It's disgusting.  With all that, are there any signs on the bridge that say, like, if you need help or something,  call this?  Is there any kind of anti-suicide prevention?  They have these little signs and these little phones, but, you know, honestly, people don't.  Of course, it's white signs.  Yeah, nobody uses them.  Nobody uses them. 
[02:06:00]  People, let me tell you, the people who are suicidal don't go looking for a phone for  a way out.  Once again, they're in a tunnel vision.  They only see death.  Yeah.  And the idea that they might go use some phones is just ridiculous because they're so sick.  They can't, they don't know the phones exist.  They probably don't know what phones are.  Maybe there should be, like, signs not directed at the people that are trying to kill themselves,  but signs directed at the people that are on the bridge saying, if you see someone stepping  over the rail, do something immediately.  Well, I mean, they should just put up a barrier. 
[02:06:30]  It's just, it's really easy.  Yeah.  Hey, Kevin, we did talk about this earlier so we could say it again.  We kind of ruined it already, but as soon as you jumped, you realized you wanted to  live, right?  Absolutely.  The second, the second I hit free fall.  And some people say, that's just ridiculous.  Why did you just not jump?  But you have to understand, I was so ill.  Literally, hearing voices that are not of my own conscious yelling at me to die.  So, if you don't know what that's like, get a headphone and have your guy record himself  saying, you must die, you know, at a rate of speed that you can't imagine, at a decimal 
[02:07:00]  that you can't even fathom, and put your headphones on and see how long you can take it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's like when Jimmy's here.  Yeah.  When Jimmy Norton is here.  Yeah.  But yeah, I regretted it the second I hit free fall.  And this isn't in the movie, so we're safe with this as well.  So, you survived the jump, obviously, you're talking to us.  You ruined it.  As soon as you made it to the surface and realized, oh my God, I survived, I'm going  to live. 
[02:07:30]  What was your first thought?  Like, what was going through your head?  My first thought was, how the hell am I going to get out of this water?  It's cold.  It's freezing cold.  I can't swim to my right.  I can't swim to my left.  There's six currents under that bridge at any given time.  And they say, unless you're a triathlete swimmer, you're not going anywhere.  And I thought, I'm going to drown.  I'm sure you're in no shape to swim either.  Were you worried about sharks?  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Let me tell you, I got hit.  Something bumped my leg halfway through.  Halfway through.  And this thing is going under me, circling around me.  And I couldn't see the film.  But I thought, oh my God, I'm going to get eaten by a shark.  I said, am I bleeding?  Am I bleeding?  Because this thing is just going to bite off my leg.  So there was a shark in the water.  He's thinking.  He's thinking something was in there.  It wasn't a shark.  It was a sea lion.  And a gentleman named MC Ward, who was on the bridge, asked by the CHP, took a picture of me in the water with this creature swimming underneath me. 
[02:08:30]  And at that time that this thing was swimming underneath me, I was no longer waiting or moving my arms in the water.  I was laying flat on top of the water.  This thing was bumping me up.  So, hey, if that's not, you know, I have a strong faith, but you know what that's all about.  But, I mean, by God.  And this thing swam away right as the Coast Guard got there.  Wow.  Did you know much about the bridge before?  You know, it's interesting.  I knew that appalling series existed. 
[02:09:00]  I knew it was actually that people go there to jump.  But the reason I picked the bridge was because I heard it was easy.  I heard there was a low rail, and I heard that when you jump, you just die.  Well, buddy, let me tell you, your limbs can be severed.  Your body can be cut in half.  And that's a fact.  When the waves are so tumultuous, as they were not that day, but when they are, they can really splice you in all kinds of different places.  You can have a hard sack on the way down.  Your lungs can implode inside the water. 
[02:09:30]  It is a gruesome, disgusting, vile death that people don't understand.  People just think you hit the water, you die.  Right, right.  That's not the way it is.  I've heard rumors that you're swimming a little bit after you hit the water as you're bleeding to death inside.  Some people hemorrhage.  That's right.  Some people hemorrhage, and they bleed internally, and they just give out.  It is really scary.  The instinct of the body is like, swim, swim, swim, but it's too late at this point.  You're going to die within minutes because you're bleeding to death.  Oh, man.  It is just... 
[02:10:00]  Do you have nightmares?  You know what?  I did for the first year.  I had nightmares almost every night.  I'd fall off cliffs.  I'd fall off bridges.  And then slowly, the nightmares became just dreams, and I'd be jumping off a bridge into water right beneath me like a swimming pool.  Right.  And then slowly, they just went away.  Someone's asking...  Every once in a while, I get them.  Someone's asking if you did the triple Lindy.  Like, did you decide how you were going to jump into the water?  Oh, no.  You know what?  It was really just a series of events where I was walking on the bridge begging myself not to jump, 
[02:10:30]  and this voice was going in my head, and I just thought, I'm a bad guy.  I have to die.  I'm a terrible person, and I just ran and really catapulted myself over, if you will, catapulting over on a track field.  All right.  And this is something else that's not covered in the movie.  Just before you jumped, what was the last thought in your head where you said, okay, let's do this?  Or was there something...  Did you think about your parents, your family?  What was that last thought before you said, all right, here it is.  This is it.  You know, I got to tell you, when I was in that mode, I couldn't really think about who I loved and how much they loved me. 
[02:11:00]  I only think that I thought, that's it.  Nobody cares.  I have to die.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Also, on the instant feedback, someone said, asked if someone...  Wait, what was that again?  I'm sorry.  Something about, has anyone, like, jumped off the bridge, survived, and jumped again?  And Eric was telling us a story that this isn't part of the movie.  Neither. 
[02:11:30]  A guy attempted three times and was successful on the third time.  Can you imagine?  Oh, you know, that guy, I heard about this guy.  He was so tormented that every time he got better from his mental illness or his sickness and how he was not feeling good, he would get better for a little while.  And then I think he would go off his medication and stuff like that.  And eventually he ended up killing himself.  But his body was so strong and fit that he would jump and he would eventually recover physically.  And then he would end up dying.  And it was so sad because he had a nice family. 
[02:12:00]  That was just...  You know, you've got to understand, people say it doesn't hurt anybody.  Look at all the families that are left behind for the rest of their lives.  Yeah, that's what the movie shows.  The movie certainly shows that.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  It's a nature film.  Yeah, you know, it's a human nature film.  It's a human nature film.  And you can't but have a moral inkling of love for these people who have lost so much.  You know, homicide and AIDS kill less people every year and annually than suicide does. 
[02:12:30]  I tried to commit suicide.  And that's scary.  And yet we have so much homicide talks about in the news, so much talks about AIDS, so many celebrities coming out saying, let's save people who have AIDS.  Let's have people come out and say, let's save the people who can't save themselves.  Wow.  All right.  Well, you were amazing in the movie, Kevin.  Sounds like you got your ass together here.  Well, thank you, sir.  You're well-spoken.  Have you ever been back to the bridge?  You know, I go back every year to drop a flower off. 
[02:13:00]  Drop a flower off.  Right.  Where I jump.  Right.  You got everyone on...  Poor flower.  Yeah, you got everyone on high alert.  Oh, my God.  He's going to tempt it again.  You just want to drop a flower all of a sudden, there's helicopters and SWAT teams.  He's doing it again.  Do people go with you and just hold on to your jackets?  Where are you going?  Yeah, where are you going today, huh?  They have him on one of those baby leashes.  Just making sure.  Just making sure.  Yeah, put this jacket on that looks like a parachute. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  My dad grabs the collar on my neck and says, just drop the flowers.  Yeah, drop the flowers and get in the car.  All right, Kevin.  Next time you want to try to commit suicide, do what I did.  Try to follow Chris Rock at the Apollo.  Oh, yeah.  That's got to hurt.  All right, Kevin.  Hey, Kevin, thanks a lot, man.  And best to you, man.  Hey, Kevin, thanks for waking up.  All right, guys.  Yeah, Eric Steele's saying thanks as well, Kevin.  Thank you very much, guys.  You were amazing in the movie, and I really encourage everyone to see The Bridge. 
[02:14:00]  It was very interesting.  Something very different.  And thanks, Kevin.  We ran out of time, unfortunately.  So I can talk to you for another half hour.  Thanks, Kevin.  All right.  You guys are amazing, too.  All right, bye.  Thanks.  And Eric Steele, thank you.  The director of The Bridge opens up a week from today.  October 27.  Great.  We were talking about it for like a year ago when the story first broke, and it was interesting  because the way they described it, it was like, oh, it's a snuff film.  Yeah.  It's pretty much.  But then the way you have the talking with the families beforehand and everything, it's 
[02:14:30]  just a really very interesting film.  And in the end, it sounds like he saved like six people.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people hate this guy.  But there's going to be copycats.  I don't think so.  I mean, they have a copycat problem already at The Bridge, you know.  Yeah, I see.  That existed before.  The only way to stop people at The Bridge is to put up a barrier.  All right.  Probably save more people with that body superhero.  I know.  It's like going to the Nakatomi Plaza.  You're going to get me a date here.  I know.  What's your next movie, Beating Chuck Lydell?  Jesus.  With that, Bob Kelly, thanks for sitting there for Jim Norton today. 
[02:15:00]  How ironic that Aquaman would direct a movie about people.  Aqua.  We also have Jeffrey Ross at Caroline's all weekend long in New York City.  We have Krista from our TV commercial.  We didn't even get to talk to her.  You want to go over to XM with us?  You can come over to XM.  She's a cutie.  Thank you.  Yeah, there's a couple guys that called and said they would do you, by the way.  A couple?  There's a few that were calling and saying, man, she is really hot.  She was the girl in our TV commercial.  You can see the commercial on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network. 
[02:15:30]  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great weekend.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Tuchel's Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show, which is to say that we've discovered  a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's, we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired 
[02:16:00]  Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's been drunk into a new radical disorder that's killed twice by involuntary stick and  repeated vocalizations.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and  an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com.  That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself one tick at a time. 
[02:16:30]  Tourette's Day.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Yes, it does.  It's a rainy day in New York City.  A miserable day.  Yeah.  Somebody on Instant Feedback said, you guys picked the perfect day to talk about suicide.  It was a miserable day.  A sad, rainy day in New York, and we're talking about jumping from a bridge.  Although, the director there was saying they picked the nice sunny days. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, well, so.  We got Krista from the TV commercial.  Yes, she'll be joining us over at XM.  And she lost weight.  She's going to ruin her whole career.  Like, what'd you do?  We said you lost weight.  Lost weight.  Yeah, I'm trying.  You're going to wreck everything.  No, it won't be better.  You're going to ruin your career.  No.  I won't lose the junk in the trunk.  The junk in the trunk.  Well, we made sure she wore the most horrific dress possible. 
[02:17:30]  I know.  It was really a bad dress for you.  It made you look a lot bigger.  The reality is Krista is hot.  Yeah, who doesn't think Krista's hot?  Thank you.  Let me see.  Can I look at her?  Yeah, she is a cutie patootie.  She's not a platso.  You know what?  I'll tell you what she's good is that she's proportioned.  Right, right.  She's got a nice big booty.  She's got her breasts.  I'll guess right now those are a double D.  It's a 36 double D.  38.  38 D, idiot.  Yep.  It's a 38 D. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I didn't know.  I didn't sleep with her.  The battles of the bra size has gone on here.  How did you know?  I just know.  What, you audition her?  We invented wow.  We know this stuff.  We figured this crap out a long time ago.  I can tell you.  You're a 38 full B.  How did you know?  Jesus Christ, you are good, you motherfucker.  Let's walk in this miserable.  Yeah, we've got to get out of the rain.  It's going to be a quick walk today.  I'm standing here in the rain like an idiot for an hour.  You're out?  Just a quick walk. 
[02:18:30]  Bye.  You're leaving us?  I don't know.  Am I going to the thing?  You can go to XM.  Yeah, go to XM.  We haven't even talked to you yet.  Come on, Jeff.  Go to XM.  You can say shit and fuck there and everything.  It's easy.  But I got your plugs in for the New York audience.  I want to hear what kind of a crybaby Jimmy Norton was at Guantanamo.  You got to go.  I call him up.  I say, Jimmy, I want to go down and do a show for the troops.  It's a really grim place.  You know, there's a million questions he could ask.  He immediately says yes. 
[02:19:00]  And I figure he's going to ask about the detainees or about, you know, I don't know, what this  is entail.  Yeah, where do we stay?  I'm going to Cuba for the first time.  And he goes, OK, well, will you promise to fly me on Continental to Cuba?  I'm like, that's all you want?  And that's that's your big question about the the stain on the American military.  Guantanamo Bay, that's the one thing.  That's what he wants.  He wants first class in a Continental plane. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  And I don't think them into the overhead.  I don't think Continental flies there.  No, not directly.  What do you think of my shirt?  But you look ridiculous.  Want me to take it off?  I'll take it off.  Get that shirt off.  That's some shirt.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So concerning.  Oh, oh, I don't get it.  I was a big fan of him.  No more.  It's over.  I'm done with him.  I'm done. 
[02:20:00]  I'm really confused.  I'm confused.  You like us.  You hate us.  You like Howard.  You hate Howard.  You bailed me out.  Oh, I bailed my ass out.  So you set this whole bit up.  He walks up with a Howard Stern like, where'd you get that ridiculous?  Howard Stern shirt.  I had this made up years ago.  Yeah.  Look at that.  That cost me $65, that stupid thing.  You know where that should be?  In the gutter.  We throw it in the street tonight?  It should be in the gutter.  I'll tell you what.  It's a collector's item.  No, it's not.  How about you put it in the studio and have fun with it? 
[02:20:30]  That is not a collector's item.  I'd rather throw it in the street.  That would be fun.  Let the cars run it over.  I'll give you $20 to ditch it and throw it under a cab.  I've got to get a better bit than that.  $20.  That would cost me $65.  It's $65.  Look, we'll throw this on YouTube.  We're filming.  You show the shirt, throw it in the rainy street, and we walk on.  And then I'll be honest.  How much weight?  $40.  Give me my $65 back.  Forget it.  It's depreciation. 
[02:21:00]  How long have you had it?  I've had this not a collected airbrush.  I've had this about 12 years now.  It smells good.  You ever seen one like that?  It was probably worth something 12 years ago.  Hey, Howard, get this.  Yeah, how many times have you jerked off on that face?  Well, I switched off.  You didn't have a towel.  Dry it.  Where's the 6'5 big man?  Oh, Kenny?  Kenny.  He's incognito.  Oh, he's probably looking for an in to stab one of us. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  Great Santini.  It's like he's like Secret Service.  He went like this.  That's Kenny.  What the hell is wrong with you?  He's a good guy.  All right, what do you want to do with the shirt?  I'll put it right there.  I'll put it for how much?  You look at full price.  That's like buying a car and then five years later you want the same that you paid for it.  He just took his $20 back.  I was drawing my $20.  Why are you giving a $1,000 fee for a fat pig?  Now you've got to do it for his $20 only.  It got down.  We cannot in good conscience give you the same amount of money you paid for it. 
[02:22:00]  It's going down.  It's not happening.  I know you lost.  Everything's appreciated.  Your last name comes into play right now.  Have you looked online what any of his shit is bringing in?  Come on.  It's just nothing.  He just took his $20 back because he saw me.  Put it on eBay.  Go ahead.  See what you get for it.  I'm going to put this on eBay.  See what you get for it.  I got $20.  No, no, no.  It's not on eBay.  You're going to get fucking $10 for it.  I'm going to put this on eBay.  All right.  You'll get $10 for it.  Negotiating in the rain here.  It's not happening.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:22:30]  Nice meeting you on the walk today.  Good luck on eBay.  I didn't know what that guy was about.  He was wearing this huge old Howard Stern shirt.  I thought he was a fan.  I thought our fans were crazy.  Jesus Christ.  You think that he was waiting there for us all day?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, in the rain.  That's really ridiculous.  People wait every day now to show us stuff.  It's kind of cool.  This is kook corner. 
[02:23:00]  I love this one.  Right here.  This is kook corner.  This is where all the lunatics hang out.  And then once you cross, it's businesswomen.  A lot of businesswomen in smart outfits.  I love the skirt with sneakers look for the subway.  That's good.  Before they get on, put their horseshoes on at work.  That's what turns me out more than a girl in a dress with, like, Nikes.  Yeah, really.  Makes the whole, brings the whole look together.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  It's the character from Bully. 
[02:23:30]  The video game Bully.  I know it's a visual, but go fuck yourself, audience.  It was good.  What do you want from us?  Oh, radio.  Shit.  That's what they want.  Damn, I keep forgetting sometimes.  Paint a picture with your words.  Could you?  Could you please?  Fucking power bottom, Opie.  That was very funny.  What?  What are you talking about?  Nothing.  Just bring it up.  What are you talking about?  That was very funny. 
[02:24:00]  Not everything has to make the air.  You know he's a power bottom.  All right.  All right.  Sometimes line of the day.  Never makes the air.  Oh, yeah.  That's the beauty of me.  None of my good stuff makes the air.  I want to make out with you heavy.  Heavy.  Heavy make out sessions.  Grab back your neck real strong.  Secretly, he wants to jump from the building.  Oh, new studio album from The Who, Endless Wire. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, new album.  First album in, I think, 85 years from The Who.  82 was the last one.  Yeah.  Oh.  Let's see.  They took down a little Jimmy Norton's poster.  Oh, Norton's poster has been slapped over with new ones.  Oh, look.  Barry Manilow, new two-disc DVD.  The greatest songs of the 60s.  That's right.  Ugh.  Look at his face and look at the day that's released.  Halloween.  Halloween. 
[02:25:00]  Barry Manilow.  He's wearing a Barry Manilow mask.  That's good.  And Earl turned me on to this band, TV on the radio.  Oh, yeah?  Pretty interesting stuff.  Hard to explain.  Kind of Peter Gabriel-ish at times.  I don't know.  I don't know if they're part of that emo movement or not.  Yeah.  Wow.  Never heard of them, sir.  TV on the radio.  We've read the wall.  We're doing all our normal stuff.  What is this debris in the sidewalk?  Where?  Is that vomit?  Or is it... 
[02:25:30]  A dead baby.  What the fuck is that?  Just another suicide victim.  Oh, bird shit is falling off of the...  Oh, you get the bird flu that way.  I think, right?  I don't know.  That's just the remains of a suicide, Ian.  Yes.  Bird shit committed suicide.  All right.  We're in.  Yeah, we're in.  See you upstairs.  The war is the most wild, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:26:00]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show. 
[02:26:30]  How to touch cornwalls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I can have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:27:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back.  нашей 
[02:27:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:28:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:28:30]  Talk about the soup and eat it on the air and the message boards are chock full of people that just love when we eat soup on the air.  You want a little soup? It's good stuff. It's from the soup man.  What kind of soup is it?  That looks like some type of clam chowder maybe or something like that.  Thanks for breakfast, Bobby, by the way.  Oh, it's good stuff.  What did you have?  Balls of bread and all kinds of stuff.  Enjoy. Enjoy.  That's some type of chowder.  Yeah, some chowder.  That could be some chicken chili or turkey chili. 
[02:29:00]  Good stuff.  Spicy.  How often does he do this?  He sends it up to the spot.  Every day.  We're like some kind of official spokespeople for it.  Yeah.  It sounds like gumbo right here.  It is good stuff.  Oh, I need that.  And then the bread.  There you go, Bobby.  Let's go right to the phone.  You got a spoon?  Thomas, Colorado.  What's up?  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Thomas. 
[02:29:30]  You know, I'm calling because you almost lost me on the laugh track with that interview,  but when you stayed straight, I appreciate it.  I want to say thanks for being kind to that guy.  Well, you know something?  For a second, old school Opie, 1998 Opie came to the surface.  What happened?  Yeah, I know what you guys are like, but I appreciate it for that one time.  I love you.  Got to go.  That angered a few people on Instant Feedback.  No shit.  And I say go screw.  No shit. 
[02:30:00]  Go screw.  It angered people.  Of course it did.  They tried to bring my mom into it.  Whatever, dude.  Whatever.  Why would they bring, like, what?  Whatever.  Who the, what the?  Because I have admitted on the show that my mom has problems, so they were hoping my mom  would do some things.  Whatever, dude.  Hey, who turned you on to that movie?  How did you know about it?  Um, I don't know.  We heard about it a year ago.  We read about it because there was a lot of controversy.  Like a year ago.  And then for no reason at all, it got brought up yesterday.  Or a couple of days ago.  A couple of days ago. 
[02:30:30]  Whenever it was.  Just in conversation.  And then it turned out the movie's opening Friday.  It was the weirdest thing.  Just kind of came out of nowhere that we talked about it.  By the way, Jeffrey Ross, worst timing ever.  For what?  Ever!  For what?  You have no idea what you did.  What do you mean?  It's okay.  I'm not, I'm not beating you up.  Was I cursed?  Remember when I said to the guy, uh, what was your last thought?  What was the last thing you said before you jumped?  And he went into this whole thing.  The listeners on regular radio, the XMers heard it. 
[02:31:00]  Heard, what was the last thing, they heard me say, what was the last thing that went through  your head or your last thought before you jumped?  And then it went right to me going, wow.  Oh, shit.  Are you kidding?  Because Jeffrey Ross was taken by what the guy said about family and not caring about  the family or any of that crap.  You went, shit.  Yeah.  Like it was a real moment by you.  Dude, I was not on the radio.  No, I was in that guy's head.  I was, my eyes closed.  Yeah.  You were in the-  I was scared for him.  Yeah.  And you just like, it was, it was, that's what I'm saying. 
[02:31:30]  I'm really sorry.  No.  It's amateur hour for me.  No, not at all.  No, no, no, no.  But I have to-  But I was really moved.  I have to bring it up because people are like, dude, uh, that didn't go over regular  radio because Jeffrey was so caught up in what the guy said.  He just went, he went, shit.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  That's why you fucking need XM.  That's right.  So you hear it.  Oh, man.  That was heavy.  But I had to say, because a lot of instant feedback came in from like Philly, especially  going, dude, all we heard was you asked a question then.  Wow.  Tell him what he said.  What did he say? 
[02:32:00]  Basically, he didn't think about family or love or any of that stuff.  He was out of his mind, he said.  Yeah.  He said he was walking up and down, up and down, talking himself not into not jumping, and  then he jumped.  There was two guys in his head.  That's bipolar.  Yeah.  Well, that's two guys in his head just saying, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  We just walked by Jekyll and Hyde, and I thought about him, you know?  Yeah.  He's a tortured soul.  He's torn.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to go to Mike.  This could be the dumbest person of the day.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning. 
[02:32:30]  It says on the phone line, drowning isn't that bad.  I've done it.  Well, we just arrived.  So are you calling from heaven or hell?  No, no, no.  I survived.  I was one of the lucky ones.  I dove into a pool this summer in the deep end, knocked the shallow, pushed off the bottom,  turned my head so I didn't knock off a girl that was on a raft who couldn't swim in the  deep end, slammed my head on the side of the pool.  I broke my neck in six places, the same break that Christopher Reeves had, and he paralyzed  me.  I was conscious the whole time underwater, and I'm like, all right, what do I do? 
[02:33:00]  I couldn't do anything.  Wait, you're paralyzed?  I was paralyzed underwater.  Was or still is?  Are you still paralyzed?  No.  They were able to take the bone out.  This happened July 1st.  July 3rd was the surgery.  It took them two days to calm down the area just to go in there and do the surgery.  I'm up about and walking.  I'm not going to get back to work for another six months, but the irony of it is that I  was a lifeguard, fireman, and diver for all these years, and I drowned in a pool, and 
[02:33:30]  I was conscious the whole time.  I was underneath the water for about four minutes, they said.  But I remember nothing else.  It wasn't as bad as everyone thinks it is.  You just go to sleep.  You run out of air and you go to sleep.  Come on.  Jesus.  You're right.  All these people.  Let's not believe Mike, because I can't imagine.  I mean, I know you did it, but come on.  Yeah, but you were paralyzed, guy.  You were paralyzed.  You couldn't flail or flip out or lose your mind.  You couldn't do anything.  Oh, good point, Bob.  You're lying there, and it was relaxing because you couldn't feel anything from your neck down. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, if I had all my...  You go.  Go ahead.  I knew what was happening.  I was still conscious.  I knew exactly what was happening.  Yeah, but the thing you could do, the only thing you could do is blink your eyes real fast.  Hope that gives you enough lift.  Yeah, it's not like you...  Hope you got long eyelashes.  If you're drowning and you're not paralyzed, you're going to flip out and struggle, and  it's going to be...  Your body's going to just go crazy.  Yeah, but once they hit the water at that speed and they break bones and stuff, how much  can you actually move half the time? 
[02:34:30]  You can't.  Right.  So you're kind of paralyzed to that extent that you're not going to be able to move anything.  So, like I said, it wasn't that bad.  This guy felt...  Thank God I got out of it.  This guy felt a seal bumping his feet.  Did you go unconscious?  Nonsense, by the way.  Well, you don't think that happened?  No, I was conscious when I drowned.  No, no, but...  Wait, wait, wait.  You were conscious when you drowned.  You inhaled water.  No, no, no.  See, that's...  Okay.  Because when you drown, there's a flap on the back of your throat that cuts off your esophagus. 
[02:35:00]  The epiglottis, sir.  I know what it's called.  I thought it was the doodle.  But I'm just saying, if you run out of breath, you're going to inhale.  If your body feels it has to inhale, your diaphragm is automatically going to suck in whatever the fuck is around you, especially if you're unconscious.  But you said you were conscious.  Did you pass out?  Yes, you finally passed out because you have no air. 
[02:35:30]  And then how long after you passed out did someone pull you out of there?  I was underneath the water for about four minutes.  And for four minutes, you didn't breathe in?  You were unconscious for four minutes?  Correct.  And you didn't breathe any water in?  No, I was under the water for four minutes.  Wow.  And when they turned me over, they said my eyes were rolled in the back of my head.  It looked like I had rigor mortis because my hands were all curled up and everything else.  And after, they said, about 30 seconds, once they brought my head above the surface, I started breathing on my own again.  Wow.  So, apparently, my heart never stopped, but I didn't get no oxygen. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Ah.  Thanks for the story, Mike.  I almost drowned once.  I went down on Rosie O'Donnell.  That could do it.  Hey, by the way, Bob Kelly, everyone's pointing out that you said drowning.  Drowning?  Look, look, dude, I'm drowning once.  Nobody even let, you know, Bobby Kelly said it right there.  He said I tried to kill myself once, and nobody said anything.  Oh, I know.  No one said a word.  Yeah, we're getting there.  Bob went, I tried to kill myself, and no one cared. 
[02:36:30]  No one said a word.  People were disappointed that you weren't successful.  Yeah.  It was just a whole vibe.  Yeah.  It's funny, though, that they heard it, but you guys were like, so anyways, when you survive,  I tried to kill myself yesterday.  I tried to kill myself.  It's not about you, Bob.  Were you hoping for a bigger reaction?  Definitely, he was.  Were you hoping for some concern in our eyes?  Well, I was hoping for you.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Bob did what?  Dude, you know, I tried to kill myself.  Dude, there was a time.  I honestly was a little hurt. 
[02:37:00]  You're trying to share a moment with us in the elevator, and I think my next sentence  was, is it raining out, guys?  Because I don't want to get wet.  No, here's what happened.  It was on the air.  He actually said, I tried to kill myself over there.  Oh, yeah.  But then he did it in the elevator.  And then in the elevator, he told the story.  Now, when you compare what he said, Bob's story of trying to kill himself, to a guy throwing  himself off the fucking Golden Gate Bridge, his shattered body trying to get out of the  water.  I wanted to hit you.  I wanted to hit you. 
[02:37:30]  Why don't you tell your compelling story?  Tell that compelling story.  It's kind of sad.  Of life and death, Bobby.  I'm good.  I'm depressed.  Oh, yeah.  Something happened with your moped or something?  Yeah.  I don't want to hear even the emotional problems of what brought you to this.  Well, I just got, you know, I've been sober for like a year.  Yeah.  I was working hard at a styrofoam factory and I worked at a styrofoam factory when I was  16.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I bought this moped and it was like my thing.  All you hear all day is just that squeaky styrofoam rubbing sound. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Is it awful?  I made styrofoam balls.  You did?  You make one half, you make the other half and you glue them together.  For what?  For Christmas.  For Christmas ornaments?  I didn't think the frigging ornaments.  Yeah.  I made the ornaments.  Styrofoam in there?  Yeah, styrofoam.  Yeah.  Well, the Catholics.  Right.  But I bought a moped.  So you saved up all your styrofoam factory money?  Yeah, yeah.  I was very excited.  I always wanted a moped and I finally bought one and a motorbacane, one of the first ones 
[02:38:30]  with the pedals.  Of course.  You could actually pedal it too.  Pedal it.  That's how you started it, right?  Right.  And then first day out, drove it.  I was excited.  I was taking it to, I think, an AA meeting.  Jesus.  And it broke.  It broke.  I left it at a gas station and then they left it out and it fell on the ground and it snapped  the block right in half.  And they told me there's nothing I could do about it.  What did you buy this piece of shit from?  From a dude somewhere in Framingham. 
[02:39:00]  Who actually...  And nobody would help me.  You go home, you figure your parents would be like, don't worry, we'll get you a new  one.  They told me that's life.  And I just went upstairs.  That's life.  Good advice.  I pushed the bureau in front of the door.  Wow.  And then I opened the window and I put one leg out.  And he jumped off the bureau.  And I sat there.  So you sat at the edge of your window contemplating.  No, not the edge, Anthony.  I was out the window.  I had one leg out.  So one leg's out.  My parents were on the other side trying to push the bureau.  Like, what are you doing?  And what are you doing?  You're hanging out the window and then you finally decide to jump. 
[02:39:30]  Well, I was...  No, I was crying for a little bit.  All right.  You're crying.  Sorry.  You know, because I was like, you know, I just wanted a moped.  That's all you wanted.  Trying to be sober.  I'm trying to do the right thing finally.  And I get the moped and then God, God, there isn't, you know, God sucks.  Stupid God.  God screwed me.  God, you're not there.  God didn't give you a fucking brain tumor.  I kept saying as much as much.  He fucking broke your moped, you selfish little cock.  And then I was saying as much as I could.  So my, you know, my parents were taking a long time to push that bureau through the door.  Yeah.  I was like, hurry up.  I can only bitch and cry a little longer. 
[02:40:00]  I'm going to have to jump, you losers.  I'm going to make a point here.  I'm going to have to do this.  You were testing.  They really don't love me.  They weren't even trying to push the door.  They were just knocking on it.  They were in a phone book trying to find a moving company to move the bureau for them.  I thought there was a donkey in front of them.  They were like, at least the moped's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm hoping it's going to be like a Brady Bunch episode where they wheel in a brand new  moped with a bow on it for you.  When did you realize like, holy shit, they're taking their time here.  Ah. 
[02:40:30]  Well, because I stopped crying at that point.  Like, I couldn't keep the emotion going.  So, you know, you could cry.  So, you jumped and you landed on Dane Cook.  That's how you met.  Pretty good.  Hey, who's this guy?  So, you jumped?  You finally now jumped.  No, I didn't jump.  You didn't jump.  You don't even have a story.  Well, they came in and saved me.  They came in and at the last second, they pushed the bureau open and they ran in.  They saved you from a sprained ankle.  That's great.  Yeah, because why don't you tell everybody how high up the window was? 
[02:41:00]  It was pretty, it was a two, it was a two family.  Two stories.  Wait, you said two stories.  Two stories.  All right.  Two stories in the elevator.  You know what?  I'm sure these guys on the bridge exaggerate too a little bit.  Kids, kids jump out their windows to go out at night from the second story.  How do you exaggerate the Golden Gate Bridge?  I was exaggerating that.  Yeah, that really sounds just like jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.  Two stories with fluffy hedges below.  Wow, Bob.  Pretty good story.  You jump and you bounce.  Actually, there was a-  You're suffering from some deep depression. 
[02:41:30]  Well, they came in and my mother grabbed me at the last second.  I was just about to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're suffering from deep depression.  You're suffering from deep dish pizza.  Actually, I was in shape back then.  You look good now, I think.  Shut your face.  You do.  Second story.  That's got to be at least 10 feet.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it was like, honestly, God, second story in one of those houses.  It was a colonial.  What houses?  It was a colonial.  A colonial out in the suburbs.  Well, now we're with you, Bob.  A colonial.  Wow.  You guys thought it was one of those ranches. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, now I feel bad for you.  Get that director on the phone.  He's going to make a new movie called Moped.  Yeah, he's going to-  It's about despondent idiots.  What do you have to say to a-  It's called Power Bottom.  He fucks people in the ass so they don't commit suicide.  You want to jump?  Come here.  Get, get, get, get, get, get.  You want to jump now?  No.  John in Utah.  Yeah, I just wanted to dedicate the day to the evilness that is the board up.  Opie. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, thank you, sir.  Oh, yes.  You are amazing.  Thank you, sir.  What the hell?  Bob Kelly actually stood up when I hit the laugh track there.  Yeah.  I said it a little laugh.  You stood up.  I stood up for you.  You punched out.  Yeah, that was real much.  Bobby, so what wisdom-  Because it came out of nowhere, dude.  You actually, I was really like, you were really drawing me in with your questions.  I so didn't expect that.  Yeah, it just came out of fucking nowhere with you.  No human being.  Which he usually does.  Because I was the one that wanted to pull him in closer. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, you really did.  You got all of us in there like, wow, this is very interesting, and then, wha!  Yeah, and just awfulness.  It was kind of out of character.  All right, let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I just want to congratulate you on a very compelling interview.  Yeah.  The last track, beautiful touch.  Yeah.  Also, Opie.  Yeah?  Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  I kind of saw that.  Saw that.  Bobby, what words of wisdom can you impart on a 15 or 16-year-old who might be sad and depressed 
[02:43:30]  and might be contemplating killing himself?  Dude, what do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  Get a moped.  Just do it.  I would just buy a Newport moped, not a used one.  All right, let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  A man dressed as gorilla tried to kidnap a child.  Dude, I broke my moped, dude.  Dude, I broke my moped, dude.  Dude, dude.  Hold my hand, dude.  Hold my handlebar.  Dude.  Hold my handlebar.  You killed at the virus, man.  Yeah.  Not you. 
[02:44:00]  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Dude.  Dude.  Wesley Snipes, indicted by U.S. authorities for tax fraud.  He's filming a movie in Africa in Nambia, which has no extradition treaty with Washington.  So they can't get him.  Expect that movie to film for about 20 years.  All right.  What's the statute of limitations on tax fraud?  He's pulling a Pirates of the Caribbean on that.  Shooting 301.  301.  Holy shit. 
[02:44:30]  It's the 100-year war filmed in real time.  That's when he's filming his new movie.  How about the gorilla that kidnapped the kid?  Yeah, they just showed that.  Turns out Mike Tyson had visitation rights for the weekend.  That's what it just said.  It said gorilla attempted kidnapping, and they had a surveillance video of a gorilla, guy  in a gorilla suit, chasing or carrying a child out.  But then they showed the suspect out of the gorilla suit, and I'll just ring my bell.  You guys make up your own joke. 
[02:45:00]  But he wasn't out of the suit, Anthony.  Okay.  What we'll do after the break, we'll segue into Mike Tyson on Donnie Deutsch.  Ah, that's a good segue.  Hey, Al from Boston.  I got all excited when I saw my pad data showing Bob's suicide.  It just said Bob's suicide.  Oh.  Then I realized that my display didn't fit the word attempt.  Or success.  That's just mean.  He tried.  If you failed jumping out of a two-story window, you would have.  And how old were you? 
[02:45:30]  16.  16.  Well, your fucking bones are so, they're like erasers at that age.  Like, so pliable.  Yeah.  You'd have just bounced off the ground.  What were you really?  Looked like an idiot as your parents would looking out.  Oh, my God, Bobby.  What were you really?  Bobby, are you okay, Bobby?  Bobby.  Bob, my moped, Mom.  Bobby, we'll get you another moped, you little cocksucker.  You got us worried to death, jumping out the window like that, you crazy bastard.  Larry, pull the car around.  We got to get him to the fucking emergency room. 
[02:46:00]  Larry, he needs another moped.  Larry, you get him a motor bocane.  Larry, he's despondent.  Bobby, what were you really trying to do?  Bobby doesn't know what thing it is.  What were you really trying to accomplish?  I don't like mopeds.  I don't like mopeds.  Feel me?  Touch me.  You weren't trying to kill yourself.  What were you really trying to accomplish?  I wanted a little attention, Opie. 
[02:46:30]  A little love, right?  A little love, Opie.  A little hug.  I want a little hug, a little love, and maybe, you know, a family that cares.  Come on and step inside that colonial window, my friend.  I'm glad you lived.  I'm glad you lived.  I'm glad I lived, too.  I'm glad.  Thank you, Jeff.  New York would be deprived of the 83rd funniest comic in town.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  All right.  I like how he's specific, too.  Yeah.  Fucking 83rd.  I had to do some quick math on my head. 
[02:47:00]  He didn't say 100.  He actually meant what he said.  There is a fucking list.  Round numbers ain't funny.  There really is a list.  This fucking bearded Jew really got me.  It's for a movie role.  You fucksucker.  All right.  We got a break.  Jeffrey Ross at Caroline's this weekend.  Bob, tourgasm going well?  Yeah.  We're going to be in Pittsburgh next two weeks.  We're going to be at PittsburghTourgasm.com.  Yes.  We should have promoted over there.  I know.  By the way, can I give my, in honor of the month of Mocktober, my customer satisfaction  guarantee.  Anybody who sits in the front row, I'll tear them a new ass so they get their money back. 
[02:47:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  That sounds...  First time I'm laying that out there.  I wouldn't want to do that.  I get a lot of bozos in the front because of that.  It makes it a lot more fun for me.  People that like sitting in the front, they go to their chick.  It's like, yeah, you watch.  He's going to fucking goof on us.  I'm going to get this motherfucker.  Watch.  I got my new leopard skin shoes on.  I'm going to wear them on purpose.  I'm going to fucking just set them up.  Didn't somebody come at you with a knife once?  Yes.  That's a fucked up story.  Jesus.  I came at him with a knife.  Some college on Long Island. 
[02:48:00]  Right, yeah.  Some lady just came after me.  You're so funny, too.  A lady?  Yeah, a lady.  Was it a lady?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  With a lady?  Maybe it wasn't.  It was a guy.  It had to be a guy.  It was a guy.  It was a guy.  It was a guy.  To carry a knife?  What am I thinking?  It was a guy.  A nail file.  It was a long time ago.  She tried to emery board my throat.  I also, yeah, there was also a guy with a gun once.  I don't know if I'm for Red Johnny and a round guy back in the day.  I had a guy with a sword at the cellar.  I swear to God.  What the fuck are you guys doing?  He walked in with like, I think his spine was messed up and he was limping. 
[02:48:30]  And I just, it was like.  Hey, limpy, messed up spine guy.  I said, look at this guy.  And he just went, you motherfucker.  I'll kill you.  Just snapped.  Wow.  And the whole crowd went, whoa.  And I just, I was like, fuck it.  The guy just left.  I was like.  So as he's walking, he went to the bathroom.  As he's walking, I'm doing my act.  In the middle of it, he walks by and I see him.  And I just hear the guy next to me.  He goes, he's got a sword.  And he pulled out like a three foot sword.  In the canyon, get a sword. 
[02:49:00]  In his cane.  Oh, one of those.  Yeah, he had a sword.  He pulled it up.  And he pulled it.  He held it close to his chest and he looked at me.  He goes, you motherfucker.  And I was like, I was in the middle of my joke.  And I was like, ugh, I'm going to fucking get stabbed by this ass.  So, how about those peanuts on the airplanes?  What made it worse is the people next to me, they saw it.  They go, he's got a sword.  So like, when I saw it, I was like, maybe it's not real.  But then I heard somebody say sword.  I was like, fuck.  And you're just trying to do your piss joke. 
[02:49:30]  I've heard, you're just trying to do a dumb joke.  Yeah, right.  I've heard, don't put your day job.  I've heard, you know, get off the stage.  I've never heard touche.  Yeah, touche.  Oh, God.  He slapped me in the face with a glove.  Duel.  All right.  We got robot weather on the way.  Oh, thank God.  They actually did it on the news.  We're not doing a bit today.  Mike Tyson on Donnie Deutsch when we get back. 
[02:50:00]  And other things.  What?  And Krista from our TV commercial.  Krista, we got to bring her in.  Yes.  Yeah, she's just waving.  She's a cutie, man.  She's beautiful, right?  I like big girls.  Yeah?  I really do.  I have a fetish for big women.  I always have.  Well, hopefully they like big guys.  Yeah, well.  Oh.  That's probably why I have it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony M.U. line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Hey, this goes out to a big fuck you to Iron Maiden and especially Bruce Dickinson. 
[02:50:30]  You motherfuckers didn't play Run to the Hills, Power Slade, Trooper, or Number of the Beast.  Fuck you.  Hi there.  This is Donnie.  I wanted to say fuck you to my boss man, the trucking company I used to work for.  I hurt my shoulder on the job and he's been trying to make a living hell for me ever since.  And if that big fat motherfucker would kiss my ass, I'd bear it for him.  And I still got one good arm I can knock his big ass out with.  So fuck you, Wayne.  I'm going to give a big fuck you to Iron Maiden. 
[02:51:00]  Fucking parents.  Fuck those assholes.  My mom's a fucking cop.  My dad's a fucking asshole.  Air this shit.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuck him.  Deer, deer, deer, deer, deer.  Jeffrey Ross in studio. 
[02:51:30]  Yo.  His movie's out on DVD, right, Jeff?  Patriot Act.  Patriot Act.  I think they saw that.  Very nice film.  Thank you, buddy.  It's on the USO website.  You can check it out.  And I'm very proud of it.  It's the funniest movie ever to come out of Iraq.  And you were in Cuba with Jim Norton recently?  I had a great time, man.  It was a great experience.  Jim, I don't know, man.  He didn't have such a good time.  He got raped by Marines, four Marines.  I think he would enjoy that, secretly.  He wouldn't admit it on the show. 
[02:52:00]  I performed for the troops, and he performed for the enemy combatants.  I don't know if Jimmy knows how to have a good time.  He is so neurotic, man.  He's getting better, but I don't know.  We were just about to go on stage.  The opening act was already on, and he made...  Getting around Guantanamo Bay is not easy.  It's like, you know, you can't walk around.  And he's like, I need my vitamin C mix.  And some poor soldier had to jump in the van and take him across this whole...  Okay. 
[02:52:30]  Well, he gets obsessed.  Club Soda Kenny soldier.  Right.  He makes Woody Allen look like Rambo.  Yeah.  He needs his vitamin C.  He needs his Mucinex.  He needs...  Camouflage Breathe Right strips.  Did he get some of those?  Yeah.  He killed, though.  He really killed, though.  He needs some Starbucks.  Oh, yeah.  He's got to do the Starbucks, too, before his show.  He's got a whole routine he goes through.  I was thinking me and him are the first comedians to play Cuba, New York, and we're playing  Vegas together since probably like Martin and Lewis or something. 
[02:53:00]  1959.  Back in the old days before the commies took over.  That's our circuit.  Speaking of Jimmy, I got an email from him here.  Yeah.  Found out San Francisco is editing the show way beyond FCC shit.  Taking out racially offensive remarks.  Not talking about the obvious nigger, chink, etc.  Just politically incorrect stuff.  How are we supposed to succeed with them doing this shit?  Jim.  So I guess Jim listened when he was in...  People are telling him. 
[02:53:30]  And apparently they're cutting out a bunch of anything politically incorrect.  Like what?  I don't know.  Does he have an example?  He didn't give an example, but...  And he says not talking even the obvious stuff, but just stuff maybe when we talk about punching,  you know, a woman with a black eye, she wasn't listening, kind of shit like that.  You know, maybe that's the stuff he's talking about.  You know what's amazing is somebody has that job.  So somebody has to listen all day.  So they have to at some point like the show, right? 
[02:54:00]  I mean, that'd be the worst job ever to take if you don't like the show.  Then you have to decide what's too funny.  Oh, that's politically incorrect.  Call the PD right now, Steve.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  I heard the ratings in San Francisco.  We got some nice bumps in San Francisco, too.  But we got to get to the bottom of that.  Yeah, I'd like to know about that.  Al Dukes does the job for everybody.  Yeah, Al Dukes takes care of it.  Whatever he filters out, it makes the show completely have to be compliant.  You shouldn't dump for political correctness. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  Well, we'll see what happens there.  Yeah.  Hey, we got Tyson Audio.  We love Tyson Audio.  He's on Donnie Deutsch.  Look at this.  Al Sauder took over another city in Iraq.  Boy, um...  That's great.  Let's stay the course.  What the fuck?  Is this a golf course?  What the hell is he talking about?  Stay the course.  Our president takes more vacations than a retired travel agent.  Stay the course. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  It's a fucking obstacle course.  It is really...  Now, I mean, it's been, of course, forever in the news about how badly it's going over there.  And people are saying this.  And the insurgency is growing stronger and stuff.  But now, like, it's really coming out.  They're calling it like a Tet Offensive.  They are really, yeah.  A Tet Offensive type thing, which, of course, marked the end of any success we may have had over there in Vietnam or any perception of success.  And now, uh, I saw a video the other day.  You see that sniper video came out? 
[02:55:30]  They're fucking insurgents with the videotaping their own snipers taking out, uh, soldiers.  Oof.  Bush is obsessed.  That's hard to watch.  I saw him the other day.  He's like, we're going to bring democracy to the Iraqi people, even if we have to kill all the Iraqi people.  Every single one of them.  If we've got to kill them all, they will be...  I look at him the way, like, Yankee fans...  He's like the commander-in-chief.  You know, I'm a big military supporter, so you respect him as the commander-in-chief.  Yeah.  I think of him as the way Yankee fans think about George Steinbrenner, you know?  Right. 
[02:56:00]  The owner might be a schmuck, but you still have to root for the team.  You root for the team.  The players and the coach, you know?  It's a big difference.  That's who's making the decisions.  Then when you step up to the owner, you know, he's not out there on the field.  He's not really understanding the game.  Nobody out there has a George Steinbrenner shirt on.  No, there's not one jersey with Steinbrenner on the back.  That would be good, though.  Wow.  They'd probably sell some asshole.  Yeah, fuck.  That would be hilarious.  What are you going to do about it?  Hey, we should get Krista in here. 
[02:56:30]  She's been waiting all the time.  Yeah, bring her in.  Krista, come in and say hi.  She's the girl that was in our TV commercial.  Somebody help her off the couch.  He said help her off the couch.  That's not nice, Jeffrey.  Oh, come on.  She's lost weight.  Where?  I said she's going to ruin everything.  Let's see.  Let's see.  A little bit on the butt, but mostly in the upper area.  You lost weight in your boobs?  No.  Don't do that.  She's lost weight in her upper area. 
[02:57:00]  Did you guys cast her, or did they just cast her?  Dude, it was really, really awkward.  You know how we are as people.  Yeah.  Horrible.  And even we were just like, this is really, really awkward.  We were in a big conference room with a bunch of executives.  Right.  And, well, they cast her.  Oh, we had to look at videotapes.  Yeah.  First, we looked at videotapes.  Was that meeting ham?  Of girls?  Like going on the car?  Of big gals.  Right.  Right.  So we looked at videotapes, and we're trying to decide who the best girl would be for this. 
[02:57:30]  We didn't want some girl who was like, you know, just disgusting, not taking care of herself.  She has sinuses like Tony Soprano.  What are you talking about?  We needed, like, a very attractive girl, but big.  Right.  So we needed it.  She's not that big.  She was bigger.  And that was the other thing, too.  That goes to tell you, though, how taken by her looks we were. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  That we could have gone with a bigger girl, but the part called for a girl that, you know, wasn't a mess.  Well, we just watched a video, right, of that guy licking your asshole?  No?  Oh, my God.  I'm not on pal, bro.  Wow.  No.  No.  Wow.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to pop the window back up.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What's up?  Stop looking at her breasts.  I'm not looking at her breasts.  I saw you.  We all saw you.  We looked at video, and then shows a few girls. 
[02:58:30]  She's in S&M.  Do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah, he has meatballs.  I do.  You do?  I do.  Is he a big boy, too?  Is he roomy in the hips?  No.  Roomie?  No, he's actually in Seattle.  Is he?  Really?  Yeah.  Does he live there?  Yeah.  And you live here?  Yep.  That's a tough relationship there.  See how that works?  That's a tough relationship there.  That's how it works good.  Did you meet him on MySpace?  No.  I actually used to live in Seattle, so.  What's your MySpace pic?  Just an I?  What is it? 
[02:59:00]  Luke, she's beautiful.  You're a kid.  You are making, like, jokes.  You're pushing your arm.  No, I'm joking.  That's all that fit.  Oh, nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Get the broken camera.  Get the broken camera on her.  Get the humor.  So then we picked her out of all the videotapes, and we're in this big conference room with the  executives, and now we have dresses, and now she has to try on all the dresses, and we  have to decide which dress is going to make her look absolutely awful.  Right.  And she's walking in, and it was just really embarrassing.  I'll be good to the listeners.  What dress did you pick?  You didn't see the TV commercial yet? 
[02:59:30]  I did.  I was just kidding.  That's the one we picked.  I didn't pick up on the dress.  Thank you, baby fat.  I noticed the you, you two thin birds next to it.  It made you guys look like you had AIDS.  It wasn't that bad.  No, you're actually a very sexy girl.  Thank you.  If I didn't have a fiance, and you didn't have a boyfriend in Seattle, wink, wink, maybe  we could fool around in a hotel across the street.  Yeah.  If I didn't have a fiance, and you didn't weigh 250 pounds.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:00:00]  Jeffrey is the worst.  He's really a little meaner since he's come back from Guantanamo.  No kidding, man.  Yeah.  Did you smack some detainees around?  I've been tortured.  What the hell happened to you?  You grew a beard.  Yeah, really.  You're working out.  You got some pec muscles now.  It's all vicious.  Jews aren't supposed to have pec muscles.  I'm growing a beard for a movie roll.  What's the movie roll?  I'm playing your mom's pussy, Robert.  I don't like the fact that he's been trying to set me up for that for 20 minutes. 
[03:00:30]  I'm playing a movie roll, and no one asked him.  You had to finally do the setup and the joke.  I had to set up and take the hit from his fucking hat joke.  It still works.  Fucking dirty pussy face.  Anthony's laughing his ass off.  He is.  We're all laughing.  Funny joke.  Very inappropriate.  Krista Mays.  Where are you from, Krista?  Seattle.  Seattle.  Shut up, dude.  I'm sorry.  I was staring at it.  Seattle.  And I got caught, and it says Krista May on that fucking D-cup.  No, originally from Seattle.  That's funny. 
[03:01:00]  She auditioned.  And then we got a bunch of girls.  And you threw meat in the closet with her.  Whoever got the most meat in their mouths.  And we picked her.  Because she was perfect for the part.  Right.  And you're a model, too.  Yes.  She models.  A Michelin model.  You know, he's a dick.  Sweetie, you're...  He's...  My mom tells me I'm not allowed to date Jews anyway.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  You really got me on that one.  Why?  No.  Is it cheap? 
[03:01:30]  Why?  Why?  You blonde-haired, perfect specimen.  Why do your mother not tell you?  Why do you got to bring religion into it?  That's true.  Why do you got to call me fat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the theme of the day.  Yeah, Jews or tomorrow?  Yeah.  No, it's fat day.  Fat day.  So let me ask you.  You know what?  By the way, Jews don't eat pork, so it doesn't matter.  Jesus.  What movie are you in?  Wow.  What movie are you in?  I'm playing B. Arthur's Pussy in a three-part miniseries. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, by the way, jet ski guy, check this out.  No way.  No, you don't.  Come on.  Stop.  Turn that around.  Let me see.  I think there is a video out there, but I got the picture so far.  This has got to be fake.  No, this is not fake.  I was living up there at the time.  Oh, it's a still picture?  Yeah, I don't know if there's a video.  By the way, thanks to Art from Boston on the Instant Feedback.  That's the guy.  Thanks, Art.  I'm going to say that's photoshopped until I see a video.  No, I'm telling you.  I was living up there at the time.  They had eyewitnesses.  He just did that.  I believe they have video and everything of this thing. 
[03:02:30]  I don't know where the video is, but...  Maybe he made it.  I don't think he made it, no.  I don't think so.  It was 1995?  I wasn't living up there in 95.  Chris, do you want some clam chowder?  I'm trying to make amends offering her food.  Do you want some white bread?  No, I'm okay.  Hey, well, let me ask you a question.  So you're a model now?  Yeah.  Like a big girl model?  Mm-hmm.  What do they call that?  Plus size or full-figured?  Plus size.  Full-figured.  Full-figured.  Yeah.  I dated a full-figured girl for a night.  For a night?  She had a very pretty face, but I had to put pillows over her back fat just so I could frame 
[03:03:00]  in her face while she was blowing me.  I'm reminded of David Tell's classic joke.  You know what I'm talking about?  What's that?  I've never been with two women at the same time, but I have been with one woman the size  of two women at the same time.  Or something like that.  I remember...  Something like that.  I actually told this girl, I said, we should get something to eat at the...  You know, I guess they get a good steak and cheese room service to get her back to the  hotel room.  Then she blew me.  And they usually leave after that, but she was like, hey, what about that steak and cheese? 
[03:03:30]  Maybe she wanted to get the awful taste of your cock out of her mouth.  I swear to God, I had to order a fucking steak and cheese, and she ate it.  She ate the whole fucking thing with fries, and as soon as she's done, she gave me a kiss  on the cheek, and she left.  Left a little cheese on your cheek?  Look at her pictures from MySpace.  Oh, come on.  See, that's why she's wearing a dress that is more appropriate to her phrase.  When was that?  Look how sexy she is. 
[03:04:00]  An internet company.  Have you seen my headshots?  I look gorgeous in my headshots.  Look at me right now, Opie.  How old a gal are you?  I'd rather not.  Thank you.  I'm 20.  And she's only 20 years old.  That's not from now, dude.  Look at that.  It is.  She's only 20.  What do you think it's from?  When she was 12?  When was that taken?  That one's a little older.  That one's about a year.  And were you a little thinner back then?  I was.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  And you're a little depressed, so you hate it a little bit because your boyfriend's in  Seattle?  That's good.  They're casting the Carnie Wilson story.  Maybe you get a difference.  Those ones are from two weeks ago.  Wilson Phillips, whatever that was. 
[03:04:30]  That's two weeks ago?  Yeah.  Would you have a puffy coat on?  That one's not my favorite.  No, that looks like a fat Mary Tyler Moore.  Yeah.  That's Mary Tyler a lot more.  All right.  You got to give up.  What about that shot?  That's beautiful.  See, thin writing.  That is a beautiful one.  I love the shadow on the right side of the fatness.  I'm kidding.  You know, you be nice, baby.  I'm fat, too.  I'm fat, too.  Yeah.  So, me and you are a little chunky.  And you know what? 
[03:05:00]  I'm with you, baby.  Oh, look.  Now he's trying this camaraderie bullshit because she said punch up his MySpace.  Punch up his MySpace.  She broke my hand with her fucking fat strength.  Look at that.  She just broke my hand.  You get Bobby's fucking MySpace up there.  I just high-fived her and she snapped my wrist going fucking...  Shut up.  I'm kidding.  That's a good picture.  Who's that?  Eat Moss?  No.  You know what?  I'm not even joking.  Show me your boobs.  No.  I'm kidding.  I'd never have you do that.  Let me see one.  Look at Bobby. 
[03:05:30]  Look at Bobby.  No, but you want to go to fat photos?  Oh, is that the flower that you threw out your window?  Cindy Crawfish.  Like, every year after you almost jumped out the window?  L. MacDonald.  Now you got me doing it.  No, no.  Go.  I think there's a fat one.  Go to pics down the bottom.  Scroll down.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, this is Colin Quinn.  He came over to my house one night with a hammer.  Why did he come over to the house?  Like fucking Carl Slingblade walking in your bedroom? 
[03:06:00]  This is before Lucky Louie and Tourgasm were on, and he was writing a script for HBO that  they were supposed to pick up.  And I was like, dude.  And they told him, no, fuck you.  They passed.  Five years.  They said, fuck you.  Sorry.  So they passed on him.  So I called him up one night, and I was like, four in the morning.  I go, dude, this is unbelievable, man.  Norton's on HBO.  My show's coming on HBO.  Your show is coming.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, dude.  And he hung up the phone.  I swear to God, 20 minutes later, he's at the door trying to break in my house with  a fucking claw hammer. 
[03:06:30]  And that's the photo I took of him when he broke in.  Where is it?  It's right there on the right-hand side.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Look at him.  He really...  Holy shit.  He looks like George Steinbrenner there.  He really was trying to beat the shit.  Look at the fat on his neck.  Wait.  Go back to Indiana asshole picture in the bottom left.  What the fuck are you thinking?  You're making fun of Chris Steinbrenner.  What the hell are you doing there?  I like that.  Over on that right side, there was a fucking steak and cheese waiting for me.  Look at that.  That is beautiful.  Thank you. 
[03:07:00]  Is that your cover of your jazz album?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  You got like a...  What is that?  Gregory Hines?  You got a fedora in your hand.  That's my head.  You're wearing a brown leather jacket with the collar up, and you're making a face like  you wanted a rat pack.  That's my step.  Good way.  In case they do Hudson Hawk 2, I'm going to be right there.  Wow.  Yeah, okay.  That's a good visual.  Everyone wants to know what your MySpace is, Krista.  Krista Mays?  Yeah, it's just MySpace.  I guess it's backslash KristaMays.com. 
[03:07:30]  Krista Mays?  Yeah.  How is that?  Jeffrey Ross live.  With a K.  Or if you type in backslash 251LB.  How much do you weigh?  I'm not telling.  I'll tell you.  Not that.  Let's guess.  Can I guess?  No.  If I'm right, will you say yes?  No.  I'll guess right now.  Ready?  You're 260.  I mean, 160.  160.  With or without the chip on her shoulder?  You're 160.  Is it chip on her shoulder?  Really?  Potato chips?  Hold on. 
[03:08:00]  Hold on.  How many things in the soup do you have in front of your face right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want some?  I love you.  Is that what?  I love her.  I want to fucking just fucking have you blow me.  She's delicious.  Well, let's keep it.  I want to make out with you.  Keith.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Good.  You guys stepped all over that fat girl's line there.  Oh.  Her name's Krista.  The one about her whipping, uh, if Bob goes and chucks the flower out the window every  year.  Yeah, that was funny, actually.  She wanted to know if that flower was the flower you'd throw out your window every year. 
[03:08:30]  Like the guy.  From where you almost.  Oh, that was funny.  Oh, thank you.  Call back.  Thank you, guys.  I love how this guy's such an ass, though.  That fat girl.  Doesn't even call her by her name.  You know, the fat chick.  We're in Canada, and they're fat up here, too.  It's a Krista maze.  All I know is, all I know is, I have, on MySpace, I have 7,128 friends.  Krista is 2,140 of them.  Just fucking.  Doesn't even make sense.  No.  It doesn't. 
[03:09:00]  It doesn't even make sense.  I haven't slept.  I've been up all night.  I could say anything at this point.  Dave in New York.  Dave.  Hey, I'm sorry.  I saw this girl on the commercial.  She's pretty good looking.  She loses weight, and I also saw Jeffrey Roth.  This guy's got no mirrors in his house?  Ooh.  I am ugly.  I'll admit that.  That's all.  I'll give Ed Cat credit for this one.  He said he spent time on the wrong site and didn't realize it.  He went to Ralphie Mae's site.  That's funny.  Come on.  Let's go to Earl.  It's M-A-Y-S, right? 
[03:09:30]  Like Willie.  Because people might spell it.  You heard of Ralphie Mae?  This is Mae Ralphie.  Spell Mays.  All right, let's say hi to Earl in Connecticut.  Earl.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to tell Krista she's gorgeous.  I'm sure she knows that.  But not only is she pretty in the face, but her body is smoking.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Smoke your ham.  She's got the weight in the right places.  I'm sure my wife's listening now and furious.  I just want to hang out with my wife.  Yeah, you're all proportioned and everything.  It's not like some slob. 
[03:10:00]  She's very well taken.  Takes care of herself very well.  Very pretty.  Very pretty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a pretty, pretty funny.  What are you looking at?  I'm waiting for some smart ass.  You're getting him all flustered.  Not at all.  She intimidates you, Bob.  I tell you right now.  I tell you right now.  She intimidates you.  I tell you, I like a big girl.  I like a big girl.  I like a girl with a nice big, big booty.  Nice big, big, you got big forearms.  What are you talking about, her boobs?  Nice smile.  Yeah, nice smile.  You got a cute face. 
[03:10:30]  You got low self-esteem.  I like it.  Are you going to recognize from the commercial?  I'm a little bit.  I mean, mostly like my friends would be like, oh my gosh, Krista, you're on, you know, Saturday  Night Live last Saturday.  And I'm like, wow.  Yeah, they ran the spot.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, they ran the spot.  And Letterman and like, you know, primetime stuff.  So I'm like, hmm.  You're lucky Patrice isn't sitting in today because Patrice would be all over you.  Aw.  He wouldn't leave you alone.  Yeah, you guys could both get diabetes together. 
[03:11:00]  Holy shit.  There isn't one.  Let me guess that was you, A.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  How tall are you?  I'm fucking 5'8".  5'8".  5'8 and a quarter.  5'8".  I'm 5'8 and a quarter.  No, you're not.  Come on.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Take your shoes off.  Hang on.  I'm 5'8 and a half.  Jesus.  She's 5'8 and a half, man.  She's way taller than you.  Aw, look how cute.  She smells good, too.  Okay.  Um, no.  What's that?  I think she got a little excited on that, that hug. 
[03:11:30]  273.  I'm 273?  73?  Jesus Christ.  70 fucking Hendry.  Honey, I'm your size.  Relax.  Relax.  You just hugged me.  Neither one of us can get around the other one.  Come on.  I mean, seriously.  You sorry?  273.  I mean, I'm a little heavy right now, but...  A little?  A little?  Well, Opie, come on.  Dude, the first time I met you, you were easily 100 pounds lighter.  I know, but Opie, you're a little...  You know what, though? 
[03:12:00]  I don't get it.  You're skinny, but you're skinny fat, which is weird.  I'm not skinny fat.  You have a...  Dude.  I like how you went right to defensive mode, though.  I really did.  Like, all of a sudden, it's like, I gotta turn this around, because they're getting to  me.  No, no, no.  You're right.  I am a fucking fat mess.  But I quit smoking.  Yeah.  When you quit smoking, you gain weight.  It happens.  Yeah.  It was a year ago, but I quit a year ago, and I'm gonna lose weight.  I think you look good.  Thanks.  Here it comes.  Nope.  No.  How's swimsuit season?  How's swimsuit?  You know, honey, I really...  Look at me.  I really... 
[03:12:30]  I'll take my...  I don't care.  I went to Aruba and took my shirt off.  It doesn't matter to me.  You know what sucks, though, when you do get fat?  All right.  Take your shirt off right now.  You're out of your mind.  You're out of your mind.  You said you didn't mind.  You're out of your mind.  You said you didn't mind.  Take it off.  Also, it was a...  Take your shirt off, Krista.  It was another country, you jackass.  Krista, would you like to see it?  Yeah.  You said you didn't care.  If she takes her shirt off.  Take it off.  No.  Just show her.  Opie, fuck you.  I know you, you cocksucker.  Show her.  What do you think of my first time on the show?  Cock sucker.  You son...  I see your little fucking head light up.  When somebody says something, I'm going to go, he's got it. 
[03:13:00]  Ding.  Show her.  Dude, let me say something right now.  All right.  Just lift up your shirt.  Shut your face.  Shut your face.  I'm skinny fat.  I forgot.  I'm sorry.  I knew you had a roll on your chest.  What do you mean?  How about this?  You show me your stomach, I'll show you mine.  Oh.  That's a deal.  I'll do that.  I want to show you my boobs, but...  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me back up.  I so want to see her.  I bet she has the perfect boobs, too.  You can tell, yeah.  Yeah, she has that shirt that you can kind of see through on.  She's 20.  You're 20?  What's all the bumps on that side?  Oh.  Yeah, what is that? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, it's part of the shirt.  Part of the shirt.  What is that?  I don't know.  Hot body.  Birds?  Yeah, man.  She's fucking...  She's got a hot little body.  Now, when did you gain weight?  Can I ask?  Do you know why you gained weight?  Was it like, because you're in New York trying to make it, and your hopes and dreams are getting  smashed, and your boyfriend's in Seattle?  No, this is not...  Please, yeah, get on mic and let these guys make jokes at that now.  Just make believe it's what?  What type of food product?  Devil dog?  What do you want to throw out there?  Let her start.  Yeah.  Let her start.  Talk to the mic.  Does this help you?  All right. 
[03:14:00]  Fucking...  Putting a roll on the mic.  Just put a roll on top of the mic.  Wonderful.  You are a cock.  I'm a carrot.  Wait.  Let her answer.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Well, I had lost probably like 40 pounds, and I was like a size 10.  I mean, I was hot.  Right.  And then I started dating Sky, and things just...  I broke up with another guy, and I just got all depressed, and I gained it all back, and  then now I'm trying to take a little bit off.  But this industry, I'm too small to be in one end of the plus division, and I'm too big 
[03:14:30]  to be in the other.  So it's kind of like I have to kind of decide, and I don't want to be any bigger.  Like, that's not...  So you're telling me, to make money in this business, you either have to say, fuck it,  and just be fat.  Like, I'd have to be a size, like, a solid 18.  Wow.  So you just got to go, fuck, and just eat some food.  Or you can, like, work and be anorexic, and...  No, I work out.  I work out probably like four days a week.  No, I mean like throw up. 
[03:15:00]  No, he's saying that you're either going to be skinny, or you're going to be just a mousse.  Have fucking ice for dinner.  You know, shit like that.  It is good.  You work out four days a week?  About four days a week, yeah.  Really?  Jog to the buffet?  Pretty much.  You know, I make a, you know, time myself to get down to the buffet.  I know what your problem is, is that you eat late at night.  You'll come home late at night.  I work.  I do work very late.  You work late, come home, chow some food.  Well, no, the worst thing is, is my roommate's, is friends with a guy who works at an Italian restaurant. 
[03:15:30]  Italian?  The Italians.  It's the Seattle accent.  Let her be.  It's the Italians.  I hope he's sticking up for you.  That's right, I'm sticking up for her.  I surprise people from time to time.  So he brings, like, food over all the time.  Oh, please, leave her alone.  Yeah, so you eat poorly.  Leave her alone.  You eat poorly?  No, I really don't.  No?  Show your belly fat, fatso.  I have visceral fat.  I know how to eat well.  That's what I have now.  It just, you know, I mean, I'm content.  I mean, I don't want to be this size forever, but, you know, if I was 10 pounds, 15 pounds 
[03:16:00]  lighter, I'd be content, and I'd be making, you know, it'll bring a lot of money, because  the industry is really growing, so.  What about being a face model?  My dick's really growing right now.  What about being a chunky hand model?  I don't know.  Chunky hand.  You're not chunky hands.  I know she doesn't.  Sweetie, what about being just a tooth model?  I'm actually going to a casting today for teeth whitening.  Right, yeah.  She's got great teeth.  She's got a beautiful face.  She's got a good mouth.  Yeah, you get some work because of your face alone? 
[03:16:30]  You really can't tell that to girls, can you?  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've done a lot of jobs with a lot of girls, and, you know,  it's, it's nice to know that you're really, you know, good looking, good looking in the  industry, because, you know, a lot of, a lot of times, especially like I've looked  on MySpace and Model Mayhem and all those things, where, you know, these girls are, you  know, not keeping up on themselves and thinking they can just get work because they're size  18, and that's, that's not the reality of the industry.  I'm going to be a plus size model.  You got to be careful, so you don't get, don't get too fat, because, you know, what happens 
[03:17:00]  is your, your thighs start to rub together, and then you get that beef jerky, that brown  skin, in the middle, listen to me, honey, honey, pay attention to me here, okay, I've  seen it on a couple broads, look at me, she went to, who are you doing?  I'm telling you, fat girls, what happens is, he used to be a sex addict, he knows all,  he used to, he used to have sex with sinks, yeah, seriously, I, I, yeah, listen to me,  honey, pay attention, he's a bad boy, don't, don't get too fat, because you, you'll get  that beef jerky between your legs, and you can't, is that a big show? 
[03:17:30]  You got dirty, dirty brown skin, okay?  I won't ever be bigger than this, like they said, like, wow, you've lost weight, yeah.  Yeah, she looks great, we made her look really fat for the TV commercial, and I, I live with  that guilt every day.  Yeah, they put some real, I, so go to her MySpace account to see what she really looks  like.  Look at that.  That one in the dress is actually what I looked like when we filmed, because that was about,  yeah, look at that.  No, not that one, the one in the blue dress.  Yeah, there.  That's what I looked like when we, when we filmed.  Why don't you have, you won't be anything on your page? 
[03:18:00]  So people can see it.  Well, you should get pictures.  Somebody send a picture.  Where do we get to see your belly?  Look at that.  Yeah, what about the belly thing?  And she shows her belly.  All right.  All right.  Pull it up.  She, she goes first.  At the same time?  Go a little higher, though, Bob.  Holy crap, shoot.  Look, see, move the mic, hold on.  There we go, look.  Pull yours up a little more.  Look at this.  Look at my areola.  Let me see the areola.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with her belly.  Dude, I, I, I, I'm, I think she's unbelievable.  Yours.  Don't get mad at me, you power bottom.  You're a power bottom. 
[03:18:30]  Obi's a power bottom.  Don't use my, my thing against me.  I came up with that thing today.  It's the best thing I've ever heard.  I want to use it all the time.  Crystal is good just now.  You know what?  I'm not even kidding you.  And I told you that right when you walk in.  She's a pretty gal.  Yeah.  A big girl, big girl.  Just, that's perfect right now.  You're going out on a limb there.  Baby got front.  And it's snapping.  Baby got front.  Hey, where's, uh.  Look at that.  Look at that picture.  My space just ran out of space.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:19:00]  Go, go home and sleep.  Let's see yours.  Yeah.  Let's see yours.  Let's see yours.  Looks like an old Jewish guy.  You got a six pack and two twins in there?  Oh.  You got me, baby.  Now it's on.  Now it's on.  You don't know who you're fucking with.  You don't.  Yeah, he made out with, uh, George Takai.  You got to look out.  Yeah.  Did you really, dude?  He stuck his tongue down my throat.  He's just hoping that'll make him lose weight real fast.  Jeffrey Ross is a very fine man.  I stuck my tongue down his throat. 
[03:19:30]  I want to see.  You have nice breasts, too.  I got pot breasts.  What's pot breasts?  No one's going to comment on what an awful George Takai impression that was.  Well, dude, I'm sorry.  Maybe if you picked up the pace, you would have jumped on it.  No, I wasn't going to touch it.  I wanted to see how long you were going to go with your fucking Captain Kirk impression.  Whatever that was.  Fucking Spock.  Who the hell were you doing there?  Get on it, Anthony.  What the fuck?  You're over there checking pal talk.  You're supposed to be doing the fucking impressions. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, I got to jump in here.  One of our staff members is in love with Krista.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yes.  Let me think.  Wait, wait.  Try to figure it out.  All right, hold on.  Let's try to figure it out.  Bring them all in.  Bring them all the fuck in here.  Hold on, E-Rock.  Bring in five.  And one of them will be the guy.  Okay.  Five or six.  Bring in like six.  Bring them five or six in no particular order.  I know I had a fan club.  Oh, you do. 
[03:20:30]  Don't believe me.  I'm the president.  We've gotten a lot of emails and stuff that say, the chick in your commercial is so hot and  stuff, stuff.  You know, there are guys, they like bigger girls.  And especially, you know, like I said, you're not a mess.  I see Nosferatu is one of the guys.  Nosferatu is one of the guys.  I've never met him.  You've never met Nosferatu?  He just scared the shit out of me.  Yeah, it's like a...  Oh, my God, dude.  That's great.  I know for the first time, though, dude. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  Lucky Krista.  Nosferatu.  One of these fine gentlemen loves you.  He's got the same shadow.  How many we got?  Five?  You can't see his reflection in the glass.  I love that guy.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's play this out here.  All right.  Yeah, let's think about this.  How about we do the old...  What was it?  What's my line?  Wait a minute.  What's my line?  Is Travis one of the guys?  It might be.  Get the fuck out of here.  It ain't going to be Travis.  Get Travis out.  Come on.  That's a friggin...  Get Travis out. 
[03:21:30]  Who the fuck put Travis in?  Who's that...  But now we're down to four.  You've got to get somebody else.  Get someone else that we know it's not going to be because he's not in here.  I know.  This is the dumbest fucking thing.  Of course it's not.  No, it's not.  It's not.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here, too.  Oh, it's not Marzi.  First of all, whoever it is is in here already.  So we know it's not going to be.  They blew it by putting fucking Travis in there.  Travis is a girl.  All right.  Here we go.  Travis is the bearded woman.  Let's play this out.  Say your name and say, hi, my name is blank, and I have a crush. 
[03:22:00]  I have a crush on Krista.  My name is Master Poe, and I have a crush on Krista.  All right.  Next one.  My name is Jason, and I have a crush on Krista.  All right.  Very telling there.  He is creepy.  My name is Chris, and I have a crush on Krista.  The bridge is out.  Okay.  Say that again.  Can you say that again?  I'm sorry.  My name is Chris, and I have a crush on Krista.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  And Roland.  My name is Roland, and I have a crush on Krista.  Can you say that again?  Wait a minute. 
[03:22:30]  I didn't hear that.  Can you say that again, please?  Without snapping your fingers?  My name is Roland, and I have a crush on Krista.  I didn't hear it, Dave.  What was he muttering at the bottom of that?  Hold on.  This is...  What did you say at the end?  I got to explain for Jeffrey Ross, and probably Bob Kelly.  He books all the guests on our show, and he's great at that.  Right.  But when it comes to being on mic, he just completely falls apart.  He chokes.  He chokes.  Right.  All right.  My name is Roland, and I have a crush on Krista. 
[03:23:00]  That's one thing at the end he does every time.  Yeah.  It's just...  What the fuck?  He doesn't know what he...  He gets freaked out.  Ask him any questions.  And he doesn't understand why you're asking him to do it again, so he's just like, what  do you want from me?  Honest to God.  Hold on.  We're a little distracted.  Did you see the bridge?  No, I didn't.  No?  Can I give you the two copies?  What did you think of the interview?  It was real good.  Yeah?  What do you like about the interview?  With the director from the bridge.  Telling about the history of the bridge, and the people killing themselves, and stuff. 
[03:23:30]  It's like he's conjuring.  His hand's always moving.  That's great.  So, one more time.  Can you get your hand out of your pocket?  It's creeping me out.  Keep it up.  One more time.  Your name, and I have a crush on Krista.  Get your hand out of your pocket.  Take your hand out of your pocket.  Leave it out.  My name is Roland, and I have a crush on Krista.  He's fucking muttering.  He falls off the heart.  Get your hand out of your pocket. 
[03:24:00]  Just keep your hands by your side.  Let him land.  He doesn't understand the concept of...  He can't.  Off that, off that.  He doesn't know what to do with his hand.  Get your hands.  Just let him hang.  Let him hang.  He doesn't understand the concept of a period.  He's just...  He's like Christopher Walken.  A lot of dot, dot, dots.  More words.  Dot, dot, dot.  All right.  Take your hand out of your pocket.  Ask him again.  All right.  One more time.  Go ahead.  My name is Roland, and I have a crush on Krista. 
[03:24:30]  I've never had it so forced.  Yeah.  Krista, who do you want it to be?  Well, don't even go there yet, because we've got to pull around with these guys for a bit.  Yeah.  I'm not even in there, too, so it's going to be hard for her to make a crush on it.  Personally, just my assessment of the situation, not giving anything away.  Anyway, Roland, I wouldn't be able to tell.  It might be.  That's just the way he is.  It seems like he's like...  But I've seen him rave about movies and go, yeah, that's great.  It's just...  It's a great movie.  Yeah, ask Roland something about pop culture. 
[03:25:00]  Hey, Roland, let me ask you a question.  Something he might have seen.  He goes through a lot of movies.  Okay.  What was the movie with Christian Slater where he played like an Elvis figure?  He was like Elvis with...  No.  He got the cocaine.  Oh, boy.  Val Kilmer was in it.  He played Elvis, actually.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Christopher Walken was in it.  Famous scene between Christopher Walken and...  What's his name there?  Just say True Romance.  True Romance? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  You remember that?  No, I didn't see that one.  You didn't see fucking True Romance?  I did not see that.  What about The Godfather?  You wear the shirt every day.  Yeah, I saw that one.  How was that movie?  It was good.  What do you like about it?  Watch this.  Action.  Killings.  Action?  Did you say action?  Killing.  Did you say fucking action like it was...  Action.  Like it was fucking a Bruckheimer movie?  I'm Sonny Corleone.  You don't mess with the Corleone family. 
[03:26:00]  The fuck action?  It's a mess.  You said action?  Action.  Seriously, what did you like about the movie, The Godfather?  The Pacino, his acting, when he gets angry, screaming at people.  He didn't want to get angry in that fucking movie, dude.  Wow.  He's pretty calm in The Godfather 1.  Well, at the end.  Semi.  At the end, he got...  What else did you like about it?  Yeah.  You're wearing the shirt.  I know.  How about give us one line from The Godfather?  Ah, there you go.  I got it for free.  They sent it to me for a promotion. 
[03:26:30]  Well, who said that?  Michael?  What?  Oh, I thought that was a line from the movie.  I'd forgotten.  All right.  This will be easier.  Ready?  Look at Christian and tell me what you like about her.  Since you like her, you said you do.  You have a crush on her.  Tell me.  Put your hands to your side.  Tell me what you like about Christian.  That'll be the next question for the guys.  Her smile.  Her smile.  One line from The Godfather.  I'm obsessed with this.  May your first child be masculine.  A perfect Luca Frasi. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  I thought he was in the room.  You closed your eyes.  You're mad.  He's in the room.  Getting down on one knee.  Will you marry me?  Fuck.  You plead guilty or not guilty?  Leave the gun.  Leave the gun.  Take the cannoli.  All like important moments in people's lives.  It's a boy or something.  I know.  Jump it off the bridge.  Geronimo.  I know it was you, Fredo. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  For old times.  It's one small step for man.  One giant leap for mankind.  And Houston got a problem.  Some sort up here.  I have a dream.  I have a dream.  I have a dream.  I have a dream.  God damn, Roland. 
[03:28:00]  You rock.  One more line from the Godfather and we'll finally move on.  I'm blanking out.  Every time I'm out, they drag me back in.  Every time I'm out.  That's three.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Let him count that one.  Don't help him because it's better when he just sits there and dies.  You can even go to two.  Yeah.  Think of some scenes.  Think of the scenes.  Why, Fredo, for wherever you betrayed me. 
[03:28:30]  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  He's the most uncomfortable human being in the Godfather.  I know.  We love him.  Wow.  I've never met a person.  You just make me fucking want to jump out a window.  Again.  People want to know if you're a pothead.  No.  You're worse than a broken moped.  No.  All right.  So what do you like about Christo, Roland?  Her personality.  By the way, Bob, we could talk to this guy every day for four hours.  Yeah.  We tried to not do that. 
[03:29:00]  How did he book guests?  We're obsessed with him.  I know.  Unbelievable.  But he books guests.  He gets on the phone and he's like Rain Man.  He's got that one track thing where he can wheel and deal on the phone and he's great.  We've never had better guests since he's been working on the job.  But the second he gets on mic, it's over.  It's over, John.  I'd like to ask if, could Shelly Sheen come in?  I don't know.  Somebody.  Somebody over there.  Maybe Will Ferrell.  We'll take Punky Brewster.  Maybe these people think they're going on Larry King or something. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  All right.  It's time to move on to, is her name Chris?  Yes.  The only reason I know that is because her name's Krista and I thought, wow, similar names.  I never remember people's names.  So what do you like about Krista?  She has really pretty eyes.  Really pretty eyes.  Now, is he just saying that to impress her?  Yeah.  They need to look at her.  No, I'm being dead honest.  She has really pretty eyes.  Wow.  That's what you like about her?  That's what you like about her?  I like eyes on a girl.  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  They are handy.  Huge melons do nothing for you.  She's got a really nice body, too, but I like the eyes.  Beautiful hair.  And she makes you look thin.  So her eyes is what really turns you on.  I'm just trying to find out if you're being real here.  Don't get defensive.  No, I'm not.  He is really defensive.  He really got defensive.  Like, you don't know.  It's her fucking eyes, dude.  So that might either mean he's trying to fucking send me away or he's really, hey, that's  what I really like about this chick.  Wow.  He's got a private pile stare going on you.  Yeah, he does.  Holy shit.  He just was looking at you like.  Well, he's staring at you now, Anthony.  So, yeah, I know.  Pugsley just gave me a heck.  Pugsley. 
[03:30:30]  He really does have that thousand-yard stare.  All right, let's move on to Nosferatu.  All right, Nosferatu.  Where's his music?  He needs his music.  Nosferatu.  The bridge is out.  You'll have to stay the night.  Don't be afraid.  No, her cheeks are excellent, and then the cheekbones, and definitely her stomach's kind  of...  Alone, despised, I have no home. 
[03:31:00]  All right, say that again, Nosferatu.  I say her cheekbones are beautiful, and then her...  I like her nose ring quite a lot, and her tummy's cute.  Dude, you have the same torso as my Aunt Peggy.  Jesus Christ.  So, you like the eyes?  Oh, wow.  I think he got back at you there.  Yeah, he got you.  I didn't really go to her eyes.  I put the eyes a little, but you said that.  The cheekbones.  Cheekbones, you like?  I like the tummy.  And her tummy.  Tummy tum-tum.  That's kind of, you know, your tummy's cute little pet name for the belly.  Someone thought you were going to say that you like her jugular. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  The neck is quite nice as well.  Yeah.  It's a nice spot there.  Oh, my God.  Fucking happy Halloween.  I get the next question.  Eddie, let's shoot this fucker.  All right, let's move on to Master Paul.  I love this guy.  She has a gorgeous smile.  Ah.  Gorgeous smile?  Gorgeous smile.  Anything else on her?  Um, she's very pretty.  Yeah.  Very pretty.  Poe seems to be taken. 
[03:32:00]  Do you have a significant other Poe?  Are you single?  I am single.  Okay.  That's a good question.  I'm single until nightfall.  Gentlemen, do you know what I mean?  I'll fuck a bat.  Yeah.  Poe seems to be very taken by her.  He's like using his Poe powers on her and shit.  But Master Poe, and with all due respect, Poe, you kind of would run after a female dog because it's female. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  So the fact that you're taken, hey, it's an attractive tail.  I like the ears, floppy ears.  You're cute.  I don't want a karate chopper, Nick.  You know, you're kind of known around this place to be a little flirtatious, to look at a lot of the girls and stuff.  So it's hard to really gauge how much, you know, if you're just being Poe.  Let's just put it this way.  He does a lot of his dating in the back parking lot at FH Ryan. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Why is everyone looking away?  Okay.  Wow.  Okay.  So, Christian, you're going to have your back being watched too closely on the walks out of here.  Hey, why is Poe 500 yards behind me?  Why is Opie bloodied on the sidewalk?  Anthony, did you see something?  I didn't see anything.  All right.  Let's go back to Roland.  Anybody else have any questions for the guys?  Are you single, Roland, or you have a significant other? 
[03:33:30]  I'm single.  Are you single, Chris?  You got nothing?  No, I got a girl.  You got a girl?  You got a girlfriend.  Are you happy with her, though?  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  And Satan?  No, we're on two.  I'm separated right now.  You're separated.  You got a wife?  We're separated by thousands of miles.  She is in a box in Transylvania.  She's on the ship right now.  On the way.  And she's eating rats to survive.  We're separated.  But soon, she will enter the eternal life of the damned. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  No, we're separated.  You know he can't be a vampire, though, because he's got a receding hairline.  There's no bald vampire.  No, he kind of had the widow's peak thing going.  Yeah.  And Master Poe.  Single, obviously.  And you got a question?  One more question for these guys?  We need one more.  One more dating question.  Well, I would like you to look.  Can you look at her when you say it, too?  What do you want me to say?  Hang on there. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, Poe just makes eye contact forget it.  He's trying to fuck me now.  Do you hear what he said?  What do you want me to say, Robert?  Don't look at me with those fucking eyes.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Okay?  And I would like to know, if you're going to take her on a date, what would your date be?  Where would you take her?  Oh, there you go, Bob.  Very nice.  How would you make her pose hoe?  Yeah.  Where would you take her?  But look at her when you say it.  Yeah.  Right in her eyes.  Right in her eyes.  Well, first of all, of course, we'd go to dinner.  FH Riley's would be.  Are you saying she's at us? 
[03:35:00]  I'd make sure I'd park under a tree in the back of the parking lot.  First of all, I'd feed this fucking chick.  I don't want her getting moody.  She's a carb up before she fucks.  I don't want her fucking blood sugar going down.  Yeah, Poe.  The FH doesn't mean fuck here.  So you take her out to dinner. 
[03:35:30]  That's it?  No, no, no.  I'd probably go dancing.  This is fucking 1978.  You're going to take her to 2001 plays?  Hey, we'll go dancing, dancing at the disco.  My hair.  I do my hair.  Then you hit it.  Chris is the kind of chick who likes dinner and a movie and dinner.  And then snacks.  He took care of the joke.  He didn't have to help him. 
[03:36:00]  I really did fucking word up his joke.  We're a team.  What do I know?  Maybe Nosferatu.  Idea of a nice night out with Krista for you would be?  Has to be nice.  Give me day.  Definitely going out somewhere in the city here and then after dinner and maybe.  After dark.  After dark.  After dark.  Going somewhere downtown.  Somewhere nice.  Somewhere even darker.  I believe just keep it nice and dark. 
[03:36:30]  Take her to the Monster Mash.  This was a graveyard smash.  Look out.  He's going to bite your neck.  Roland's having a nervous breakdown in Anticipation.  So they were not up to you.  But he's panicking.  No question.  So you just take her out.  That's it.  You have no place to go.  You're going out to like a bar?  What the?  Where are you going?  Look at her though.  Don't look at me.  Look at her.  Tell her where you'd take her.  We'd go by the blood bank.  No, we'd go downtown.  There's a restaurant I like down there. 
[03:37:00]  We can go.  Then after that, go to Lower East Side.  Wait, what's the restaurant you like?  This Italian place.  Look at her.  John the 12th Street.  We can go to right there.  And we can go downtown after that.  There's a few bars on the Lower East Side that we can go to.  And then after dinner, where would you take her?  Would you try to take her home or would you just drop her off?  Of course.  I would see exactly where we go from there.  Depending on where she's going.  Take her home and then see what happens.  If she's with me, she's with me.  All right.  Very good.  Chris.  Chris, your idea of a good night out. 
[03:37:30]  A nice dinner and possibly a movie.  Movie.  That's it?  A movie.  Would you go first?  Movie or dinner?  Dinner.  Dinner and then a movie.  It would all depend on the schedule because he has to put on a white t-shirt and be the  screen.  Wow.  Wow.  He's going to, he's going to, he's going to, he's going to fucking get a drive-in.  I'll ride him.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Trying to be nice here. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  What am I doing?  Put him in a blue shirt.  We can do the news.  The weather.  So you go, you got a dinner, movie.  So it's basic, like fucking 14 year old date night.  I don't like, you know, too many fancy things.  I don't like, you know.  Fancy.  You call that.  You don't like.  I don't like, you know.  Like what?  Like a nice restaurant.  I don't like nightclubs.  Maybe a Broadway show.  Something like that.  Do you like, do you like shows, Krista?  You don't like, you don't like going to nightclubs because they make you check IDs? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, no.  He goes to a fancy nightclub and they use a velvet rope to hold up his pants.  You don't want to.  That wasn't that bad.  Because she said she likes, like Broadway.  You ever been to a show?  Yeah.  Beauty and You.  No, she said she takes up Broadway.  No.  Only a couple.  Beauty and You.  I'm sorry.  No.  That's okay.  We got it.  All right.  But, you know, that's the kind of thing maybe she would like.  Just, it's okay.  You got a girlfriend.  Yeah.  So, obviously, you guys like dinner. 
[03:39:00]  They're in movies.  So, we got dinner over here from Master Poe.  Dinner and F.H. Reilly's.  And then we got fucking Coffin.  We got a night in a coffin.  A night in the cradle of three.  At the blood bank.  Plus, I would serenade her.  You would serenade?  Oh, yeah.  See, that's weird.  Ah, yeah.  Poe sings.  You want to sing a little for her?  Yeah.  Can we hear a little?  Eat it.  Eat it.  Poe?  The floor is yours.  Someone left the cake out in the rain.  Here's Master Poe. 
[03:39:30]  When the food hits your mouth like a big pizza.  Here goes Poe.  Is there any artists that you want to hear?  Do you like?  What kind of music do you like?  What kind of genre?  Hip-hop.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  R&B?  Sure.  A little R&B.  Here we go.  This is Master Poe.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Master Poe.  Oh, no.  I can't do Casey and Jojo.  Just ask Master Poe if you can sing Jodeci.  Casey and Jojo.  Same shit.  There's two guys. 
[03:40:00]  All right.  Mm-hmm.  You don't have to look at me if you don't want to.  No, you have to look at her.  It's a serenade.  If this world were mine  I would place at your feet  All that I own  You've been so good to me  If this world were mine 
[03:40:30]  Who just farted in the middle of that?  Holy shit.  I've never  Poe's getting all sweet and shit  Someone blasted a fart  I'm sorry I pooed, Poe  Thank you for pooing  I was getting douche shivers  I got up and put my ass in the microphone  You sang the gas right out of Jeffrey Ross  All right, good enough.

[03:55:30]  Very nice of you  How are you doing  Doing great  You want to do a little weather  And then first of all  You're clearly a science guy  Yes I am  Okay why don't you tell the people about that  I'm here for Siemens and Polytech University  Polytechnic University  And we're having a thing tomorrow  What is a thing  What is a thing  Well it's a science  It's a whole science thing  Where you know  Polytechnic University  Center for Youth and Engineering and Science  A.A.A.S.  We have to develop several algorithms to attract students to engineering and science 
[03:56:00]  And I'm here with you because you know weather is another fun and exciting area of science that impacts our lives  It is a fun and exciting part  Yes it is  How about you do some weather  Let's do it  Oh today look at the rain in New York  Holy cow you know what  It's not going to be conducive for robots now  So I won't be going out in today's weather  I think I want to stay clear of that  Does anybody remember last year?  Now tonight  Oh it's getting kind of cool tonight  You might want to snuggle with your other half  Because it looks pretty good in New York  Mostly clear and breezy 
[03:56:30]  And a little cool  The five day forecast today  I'm staying inside of course  Because I don't want to get short circuited  But the rest of the week looks pretty good through Tuesday  Pretty good highs  60, 61, 58  And 57 on Tuesday  So your mattress is free  That's a joke son  Don't you get it  I made a funny son  And you're not laughing  Yeah  Wow I'm sorry  Does anybody remember last year?  Sorry about that  Wow  That's awful  That was by the way 
[03:57:00]  The news  Yeah yeah  Local news?  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  Which should just be  Just stop it already  Just stop it  I read NBC  Is major cutbacks over at NBC  And one of them is going to be in their local news divisions  Because they understand  It's a waste of time and money  The local news things are just now a parody of fucking news shows  When they bring out  You know  You used to have people  You actually thought were giving you the news  And the weather  And sports and stuff 
[03:57:30]  And now they got these bimbos  With a weather robot  And that's  Every time you tune in  There's some guy doing some wacky thing  With cheerleaders  Maybe he's dancing on the street  Or talking to some fucking group  But it's nothing that resembles news anymore  So just do away with it already  That was a prime example  They brought a robot in  To do the weather  A killer may be loose in your neighborhood  Find out where 
[03:58:00]  At 11 o'clock  Yeah yeah  The teases  And no one goes to local news when something happens  They go right to CNN or Fox  Or one of those  Your dick might just be a vagina  Could it be?  Yeah  Is yours?  Tune in  My dick  They're asking for Tyson Audio  You want Tyson?  Yes  You do?  Well you can't end the show  On that fucking gay robot  Yeah if the robot thing would have been okay  That would have been one thing  But Jesus Christ  We could do that  Little Tyson  Little Tyson 
[03:58:30]  It is Friday  And early what did we learn?  Flying standby  What's up?  Good morning boys  I have a what did you learn  It's the obvious one  Today I learned that the FH and FH Riley's  Does not stand for fuck here  Have a good weekend boys  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village  My brother's restaurant  Nice plug  Alright  Mike Tyson Audio  On Donnie Bleach  By the way I think that's going to be the line of the day  Oh well 
[03:59:00]  I can only dream  We'll find out in a few minutes  What was inside Mike Tyson's mind  When you were 28  When you were 12 years ago  Versus what's different today  I don't know  I was going through  I was going through a change period in my life  That I just weren't capable of dealing with  I didn't really want to hurt anybody anymore  I didn't want to be the champ of the world  No one  Because that meant  That took a lot of energy for me  Some people it doesn't take a lot of energy  But for me to actually be the best  I have to  I have to block up the total world 
[03:59:30]  And just be totally into me  Almost from a megalomania point of view  And that took a lot  Megalomania?  Took too much energy  Everyone's my adversary  So I just took too much for me  Too much  Is that Roland?  What the hell is wrong with  Mike is another  He's another guy  Another punch drunk guy  He's a megalomania  Megalomania  What was he on?  What was he plugging?  What was his story?  He's doing a side show  He wants to beat up girls  He's supposed to fight bitches  Yeah 
[04:00:00]  That's what he's supposed to do now  Let's do it legally  He's doing a demonstration thing  Like back in the day  A fighter would go to town to town  And do a few rounds with a guy  And then sign autographs  And you know  Makes a few thousand dollars  But he wants to do it girls  He wants to fight some girls  Wasn't he convicted of raping one?  Yeah  Yeah perhaps he's not using good judgment  I want to give the ins and outs  On how to rape a bitch  First you punch her in the face  I want to show how hard it is  To rape a bitch with boxing gloves on  Because you really can't use that thumb 
[04:00:30]  You could be at the learning center  Rape 101  I couldn't use that thumb  You could use it maybe for eye gouge  But that's about it  It's an opposable thumb  I have them on my feet  And then you can't  Hold her up with my prehensile tail  I choked her up with my tail  And then I held her with my foot  Held her ankles with my feet  And then  And choked her up with my tail  And then I rubbed my rainbow asshole  On her face  My red mandrel ass 
[04:01:00]  Because I'm a megalomaniac  I'm a megalomugger  I'm a  What the hell did I say I was?  I'm a megalomugger  I'm some kind of  Megalomania  I'm a megalom  I'm a mugger  I mug people  I mug people with my feet  Oh this guy is gone now  Then I wipe my ass  With my last three dollars  They discuss race here  I want to  It's back to a quote that you said 
[04:01:30]  You said  They would give the late  Jeffrey Dahmer  Of course the guy  The sick  Serial killer  Who would eat kids  A second chance  Before they gave me another one  If you saw a police line up  And saw Tyson and Dahmer  And they asked  Who killed and ate these people  You would pick me  And not Jeffrey  That's me just being facetious  And tripping  Sometimes I feel so  I get mad  And I strike out on people  Maybe I was one of  What were you trying to say to that?  I don't know  I was saying  This is a racist society maybe  Oh so that was a  That was a black white thing  I thought that was more of just 
[04:02:00]  You know  People look at Tyson one way  Well I do  But I always put racism  Because that's how you get  That's how you get  The true emphasis  That's how you get  Coming  That's how you brought it up  Because the two of us  Is distinguished the two of us  No it's interesting  You see I think  What you did was racist  I saw the  Genuinely the way I read that  And that's why I came up  With your last comment  That you're a guy  That people are always  Never going to give the benefit of the doubt  That you're a guy  There's no benefit in doubt anyway  But let me finish  That you're the guy  That it's easy to make you 
[04:02:30]  The bad guy  And I just saw  You compared yourself  To the most heinous criminal  Of all time  And they still blame Mike  I didn't see black and white  In that at all  I didn't  That was  That was a colorblind statement  Well I don't know  That's your statement  That's your perception  But it wasn't of mine  So that was  Because you're a black man  People  No I'm just  Sometimes I'm a quack  And I like to start trouble  I'm a drama king  Wow  Wow  I like to have an intelligent conversation with him  Sometimes I like to kill people  Why would you go there  There's no doubt in facetious 
[04:03:00]  They mixed that up  Because they said like  Who would have eaten people  And if you see the movie  I do eat people  And I squish them  And I shake them out of the train  He did bite a guy's ear  Yeah exactly  He did try to eat somebody  They had me chained up  Damn good point  At least Dahmer cooked it first  Yeah  Another fucking doubt  With a little clothes on  Sometimes I'm a quack 
[04:03:30]  I quack like a duck  But then I go back  I get a four hour nap  Before my two shows  That's a racist statement  You just made  That's a racist statement  You say my hair is nappy  I'm gonna go  What did you just say  I'm gonna go see you at Caroline's  On Friday and Saturday  I'm gonna  I'm gonna rape you with my tail  I'm fighting  A girl named Caroline  I'm going to Caroline's  I'm gonna sit up front  See if that fuckhead  Will fuck with me  I'll use my foot  And choke him out  Fuck his guarantee  Fuck his guarantee  I'm gonna bite his face off  I'm biting Jeff Ross' nose off 
[04:04:00]  I'm gonna take  I'm gonna grab his girlfriend  And climb the Empire State Building  And see what he do about it  I need the 50 bucks  I'm gonna go fuck with him  You can't  There's no  There's no doubt on perception  I'm gonna fuck you  I'm gonna  If I eat you  There's no benefit in doubt  There's no benefit in doubt  He goes  Well I'm giving you  The benefit of the doubt  There's no benefit in doubt  Right  I'm being profound  I was being tribulatious  Alright listen 
[04:04:30]  Mike explains that  Words are his weapons  This could be good  Oh man  You've talked about now  That words  Are your new  Your new kind of battleground  I never said that  I'm gonna read you what you said  You said words as weapons  I realize at this stage of my life  I'm not my battleground  I'm gonna say  Listen  I realized at this stage  Maybe this is something  You were just saying  Of course  At this stage of my life  There's nothing wrong  With backing down  You get to set a good example  You don't have to throw blows  Or be belligerent  To get your point across  You can disarm people with words  I probably have a 20,000 word vocabulary 
[04:05:00]  I'll match my wits  With anyone on literature  Science and the arts  Wow  I probably did say that  Maybe not science  Well maybe not science  But probably literature and the arts  Yeah  Literature  What's your favorite  Who's your favorite author?  Oh now it's  A few of them  I like Alice Walker  I like  Alice Cooper  What I really like to read  I like the old satire books  Like Voltaire  And those guys  Yeah  He's not reading Voltaire  No he said Voltron 
[04:05:30]  He likes Voltron  The cartoon  This is like making fun  Of a special ed kid  It really is  Donnie Deutsch  Just set him up for that too  He goes  Oh you say literature science  Who's your favorite author?  It's like he's calling him out on it  Well you know  It's not like he's a politician  And you're going to make him sound stupid  He's a boxer  A retired boxer  Retired  But he punched people's faces  Until they fell down  That was his job  I like Harry Potter  Harry Potter  Harry Potter 1-2  But the third book  Wasn't as good  The 1-2 was good  But the third one 
[04:06:00]  Didn't even cover the story  With Harry  I like the  Actually  I'm a big fan  Of the pop-up book  Yeah  I like when you  Can open a page  And all of a sudden  It's flat when it's a book  But you open  And then there's a house  With a tractor  And it's a little story  About a farm  I like to touch  I like to touch  The buildings  In those books  You pull a lever  And the chicken moves  I am a  A fan of literature  But if I see some  On the street  I will put it  In the trash can  Where it belongs  I don't like science though  Science is scary 
[04:06:30]  Science is scary  One time I combined  Coca-Cola  With Diet Coke  It was Pepsi and Coke  And I mixed it  And I was scared  I put it with Mentos  I made it Pepsi Coke  And it foamed up  And I looked like  A mad  Mad dog  I look like  I look like  I had rabies  They tried to catch me  I don't like science  Because they may find  A way to stop me  Hey flying standby  Really fast  Just updated  Your words  Are your weapons 
[04:07:00]  No one's ever been  Raped by an adjective  Yes  Old satire books  Like Voltaire  And those guys  Yeah  Sometimes I have to  Get a different volume  Dictionary  Because I don't have  The words  In the modern Dictionary  It's hard to get  The old volume  Dictionary  We were in a bar  And I started with you  Because obviously  Let's go through your life  And you're the toughest  Guy in the world  Guys  Do you truly back off now?  Well now I do  Yeah  You do  So no  You wouldn't even  There's no way 
[04:07:30]  You'd get in a fight  They have to be  They have to do something  To my children  I'd say something like that  But you know  Yeah  Jeff Ross kicked my child  In the face  He roasted my child  He was in front row  With my child  Yeah  Mighty Joe Young  He insulted Buddy Joe Young  I'm going to get shot  You're going to think about my life  You could say  I have a really great life  I really have a great life  But who am I 
[04:08:00]  Now you've got a five year old kid  That's never done anything  They have AIDS  Or they have  Some barcone disease  Or they crippled  So how do you equate that?  Now what do you do?  Do you have sympathy for that?  I am somebody who's born  With a tremendous  Physical flexion  I don't even say  Listen why  God made them crippled  Do you think God's a great guy  Because he made this particular person crippled  Those are one of the instances  You can't understand  And you have to have faith  Sometimes you can't understand  When you see a guy  That's  You say God is  You say one of these black 
[04:08:30]  Militants  Militants  You know  You think about him  He may say  Well I've been through  My family's been through slavery  I've been abused  I've been through this  I've been  So now you have empathy for him  Because he's mean  He's arrogant  He hates all white people  Now  I don't have empathy  Now you think he's a good guy  No I don't  No my point is  We can all  Everybody who is broken on this planet  I guess we're all broken in some form  Everybody who's either committed a crime  Or has hate  Or what  There's some reasons  Does that mean we let him off the hook  No no one gets off the hook  Everybody's got to be accountable for their actions  But that don't mean you denigrate them as a human being 
[04:09:00]  From a humanity point  Yeah  Listen to Mike  That was a good one  That was a good one  Not profound  You got through that  You got through that  You denigrate them  Yeah you kind of  You feel like you lost me in the middle  Better vocab than me  You did well in that  What happens when you do things  As a matter of fact  If a kid has bronchitis  What happens  I'm verbally sparring  I saw him once get on a plane  And he walked past me  And I was in coach  He walked past me in coach  With the headphones on  So people wouldn't bother him  And he had a book and a dictionary  Really  And he just sat there by himself  Must take a long time 
[04:09:30]  The  Alright let me look that up  Every word  Eight  Eight  Yeah  He had to look up Mike Tyson  Finally  And there's all the relationships with them  All the  Like my older children  Are like  My oldest daughter  Is like  Always  Conservatives around me  And they would always tell me  That she's  She's funny  And she's gregarious  And then when I see her  Every time I come to her  Everybody laughs  I come to her  And everybody stops  She stops  So she 
[04:10:00]  She's very apprehensive  Around me  And stuff  I don't think she thinks  I'm real fond of her  But she's very apprehensive  And she's very  She's very bright and witty  And she's very  Cautious about what she say  And do around me  Why do you think that is?  I don't know  Because in the past  I probably was too  Disciplinary  You know what I mean  It was just  It was too hard  I was like  Cuss was with me  These are chill  These are girls  And I'm like  That's how I grew up  By a young age  I was  Boom  Everything came at me  From a human grown perspective  Boom 
[04:10:30]  You have to do this  Boom  You have to do this  Boom  Boom  Boom  And I tried to do it  With my kids  And they go to special schools  And they hang out  With these  You know  These little white kids  And they all having fun  And they're like  Huh?  Wow  Alright  What?  That was terrific  Yeah  Why was she afraid of you?  I don't know  Because maybe I punched her  In the face  I like the  I'm going to eat your children  Mike Tyson better  Yeah  I like the  I'm on the Zoloft  I'm on the Zoloft  To keep from killing y'all  Yeah  You don't like the gregarious Mike?
