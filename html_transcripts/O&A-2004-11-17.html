<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with unintelligible audio and a song snippet before launching into a discussion of the hosts' previous day: Anthony’s video game playing, Norton’s internet trolling, and Opie’s bathroom break.  The conversation quickly turns sexually explicit, fueled by listener calls detailing graphic sexual encounters, including one involving flatulence.  The hosts reference a past stunt involving alleged sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral and discuss their career trajectory, including previous firings and their current XM Satellite Radio gig.  They touch upon the R. Kelly sex tape scandal, the New York Post's Photoshopping, Fox News' euphemisms, and their criticism of the phrase "people are saying." Opie shares the recent death of his father and his struggles supporting his grieving mother, including a humorous anecdote about avoiding "Bridget Jones's Diary." Anthony details his experiences with "Half-Life 2," "EverQuest 2," and "Grand Theft Auto."  The hosts briefly mention a book project.

A significant portion of the show is dedicated to critiquing Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs list, specifically the top 20.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton express vehement disagreement with many selections, insulting various artists with homophobic slurs (calling The Cars "faggy"), and using other offensive language to describe Bob Dylan ("son of a bitch" with a terrible voice).  They discuss the legend of Manny Dorman, John Lennon's death and Strawberry Fields, Yoko Ono, Michael Jackson's acquisition of the Beatles catalog, and a cancer commercial.  Listener calls offer varying opinions and a caller shares a story about seeing a midget carrying a carpet. Frank Caliendo is mentioned as a potential caller, and Sean Lennon's music and his mother's influence are discussed.  Jim Norton's punishment for a coffee infraction—reading from "Rent Boys"—is also highlighted. The number one song, Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone," is met with further derision. A Newgrounds.com animation contest is promoted, and the segment ends with a "hundred grand" prank call.


A brief segment features Peter Kessler discussing the Michigan-Ohio State football game and a golf radio minute about Bobby Jones.  The show then returns to a discussion of the supposed emotional distress of John Kerry supporters post-election ("Bush Flu"), and the toll of the presidency on past presidents.  "Footsie the Trucker" calls in with sexually explicit anecdotes.  The conversation shifts to cosmetic surgery, with offensive comments about women who undergo procedures. TJ from PA clarifies a previous misunderstanding about Jim Norton's political views, followed by a discussion of a controversial ABC Monday Night Football intro and the perceived double standard in the reaction.  Jim from PA calls, recounting a boating accident that resulted in brain damage and vision impairment, leading to offers of support and assistance to help him meet women in NYC.  A "Fag Talk" segment with Bob the Fag Man features overtly sexualized and offensive commentary about cigarettes.  Further calls include Dale from Kentucky's story about a woman with silicone genitals, Mike the Pussy's graphic sexual encounter details, and a brief call from Blind Dave from Connecticut.

The broadcast continues with a discussion of Brian Williams canceling a scheduled appearance due to the show's "bad rep."  This transitions into a listener's story about a woman selling a ten-year-old cheese sandwich claiming a Virgin Mary image, which reached $70,000 on eBay.  The hosts discuss similar incidents and a past incident where a listener attempted to break a pane of glass believed to contain a Virgin Mary image in Perth Amboy.  Listener calls detail more alleged miraculous religious images. Eric recounts a positive experience with their "WOW" bumper sticker.  The Nigerian advance-fee fraud scam is discussed, along with a scam targeting an elderly woman.  The segment concludes with the playing of "Lotion" by Greenskeepers and a musical rendition of a *Silence of the Lambs* scene, followed by further discussion of fraternity hazing, including graphic descriptions of degrading and dangerous rituals.

A segment focusing on fraternity hazing features Anthony recounting his own experiences, including being intoxicated and abandoned in rural areas.  Callers share similarly brutal and humiliating hazing stories involving physical and sexual abuse, and forced consumption of substances. A news story detailing a hazing incident resulting in serious injuries is also discussed.  A call with Frank Caliendo covers his work on MADtv and impressions of George W. Bush and Terry Bradshaw.  More callers share hazing stories, and the segment concludes with XM radio advertisements, listener calls, and banter.

[00:05:00]  We're just minutes away from another Opie and Anthony show as we spread the ONA virus across America  Anthony's playing some video games in the office  Norton is trolling the internet for horrors  And I gotta run to the bathroom and take a crap  We'll all be happy and we'll be on the air in a few minutes  Stay there  We'll be right back 
[00:05:30]  We'll be right back 
[00:06:00]  We'll be right back

[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[00:09:30]  Desincration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing, and then when they go too far, they  suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place. 
[00:10:00]  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God, is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day. 
[00:10:30]  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now with a new clap of the radio.  Ho, ho, opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie is crazy, big and handsome.  I don't know.  Your mom's box. 
[00:11:00]  You'll be an Anthony.  We stink.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Oh, come on.  God.  This is not how we're supposed to start a radio show.  Don't worry, Washington.  It's not about you today.  Holy ass!  No, that was so bad, Jim.  Jim, that was so bad.  And then he goes, he does it and goes, it's not bad. 
[00:11:30]  It's not bad at all.  No, it's horrendous.  And it wafted over here, and it was just like I stuck my face in a pile of dog shit.  What the hell did you eat last night?  Dude, it's way too early to be smelling your farts.  We shouldn't have to smell your farts ever, but especially at 6 in the morning.  I just got nervous.  That was so bad.  There's too much Lysol in the air now.  Yeah, but you need it.  The Lysol doesn't make me want to puke. 
[00:12:00]  I was so close to throwing up.  I think we should force him to read from Penthouse Letters.  Red Boys.  Not Red Boys.  He'd enjoy that.  He likes that.  Let's get Penthouse Letters and force him to read a little section from that.  Well, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We stink, especially today.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Thanks to everybody that turned on their radios overnight,  and they're listening to the brand new O.P. and Anthony Show for the first time. 
[00:12:30]  I find that odd.  That there's brand new listeners every day.  It's unbelievable, and the numbers are just going through the roof.  You've got to catch up on things.  They're ramping up.  It looks like the faithful listeners of this program.  Ramping up?  Did we hear that in the meeting?  Yeah.  I can't imagine that there's a lot of faithful listeners yet,  because we've just started this new show.  Yeah.  It looks like they're kind of spreading the virus for us  and telling their friends, because the numbers are just getting out of hand.  They're going up.  Up, up, up, up, up, up, and up. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, my God.  It still stinks in here.  We've got 45 listeners lying around here.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God we had our first conference call meeting yesterday.  We all had to gather in the engineering room,  because, you know, our office isn't done yet.  But they are making strides.  I don't want any bitching about the office today.  None at all.  I'm going to take the high road.  That office looks like it's going to be done by Friday. 
[00:13:30]  I know.  It is beautiful.  It's looking really, really good.  Very happy about that.  But yesterday we had our first.  Sorry, Anna.  You get a phone call like this, you can't, like, blow it off.  We'll get to your conference call in a second.  Jim in Queens, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How you doing, boys?  Pretty good.  Last night I'm doing my old lady.  She's doggy style.  Right.  And I'm like, all right, it's good.  She's good.  She's moaning.  And she's farting. 
[00:14:00]  And I'm like, oh, my God.  And she's blowing gas right in my face.  You sound like Tony Danza.  No.  He wants some prayers with doggy style.  You remember me?  I'm from Peppers and Balls.  Oh, yeah.  Right on, man.  How are you?  Bubba Ray's bitch.  Yeah, good.  All right.  Good show.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  I remember him.  He almost got killed by Bubba Ray.  You got it.  You got to keep that stuff in during sex.  Do you blast anything out like that, Jim?  Never.  Like the one you just blasted?  Never.  Never.  You hold it in?  Absolutely.  I just held another one and believe me. 
[00:14:30]  You did.  Oh, yeah.  Out of courtesy and respect.  And what was the first one?  An attention getter?  No, I just got scared.  Sometimes I sneak out and I get nervous.  You know what that is?  The music starts.  Oh, that's kind of right.  That's a threat, the first one you just did.  That lets us know that if you do it during the day, it's going to be that bad the whole  day.  So now, in the back of my mind, we're trying to do a show here and I'm like, if Jim  farts, I'm going to throw up.  We shouldn't have to start the radio show with Ben lighting candles and blowing Lysol all 
[00:15:00]  over the studio.  We had this whole thing we wanted to talk about, the conference call and what we did  last night.  I went and saw the Incredibles and checked out half...  God damn fucking ass fucks.  What's the matter?  Your jack still isn't working properly?  Just permanently spackle over that jack.  Just ain't going to work.  Well, the headphones were plugged in, so I thought that it was fixed, but it's not fixed, I guess.  So maybe it's my fault.  I don't know.  All right.  Anyway, and you checked out Half-Life 2 last night. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yes, I did.  So we were going to talk about all that, but then he farts and just wrecks the whole mood  of the freaking first break here.  No, the mood's not wrecking.  There's candles lit all over the place.  I like that.  It's kind of nice.  You like the little candle burning on the console?  Yeah, can you put it in a more flammable place?  Put it on top of the old poker chip stack.  A more flammable place.  That would be your ass.  Yeah, don't fart in front of that flame, Jim.  Have you ever lit a fart on fire?  No.  No, I don't waste it with that.  That is goofy.  Yeah.  That's white trash.  A little homo, too. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, a bunch of guys.  Some of that.  They're assholes up.  We'll be talking about that a little later, too.  I didn't say you have to do it in front of a bunch of guys.  You do, though.  That's what these guys do.  They never light them alone.  Who lights a fart alone?  You're just alone in your apartment.  The son of Sam, maybe?  Yeah.  You know, it's usually in front of a bunch of guys, the same type of guys that give each  other Roman war helmets and take pictures during parties.  Yeah.  I've never been into that whole scene.  You know, I've got to put my foot down. 
[00:16:30]  Put my foot down.  Who cares?  Well, because you point it out every time I do it.  We have to, but it's funny.  I'm going to have to put my foot down.  We can't do homoerotic stuff today if we don't have sexy stuff going on.  We need something a little sexy.  We've got to balance out this show.  We're supposed to have a couple trying to become the sexiest state in America.  Oh, yeah?  California has that title as we speak, but they blew us off yesterday, so I don't  know if they're going to call back today.  But we do want to get into this hazing of college kids when they're trying to join a fraternity. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, we've got to talk about that, I guess, a little later.  I guess, if we can balance it out with some hot, like, heterosexual stuff.  We need some hotness.  We definitely need some hotness today.  Because those stories are just, ugh.  Might as well be reading out of rent, boys.  Huh?  I want to know who's going to call in and have sex on the phone.  R. Kelly and Sheffield's wife.  Yeah, that's a crazy story.  What is the deal with that story?  It's right on the front page of all the papers in New York here. 
[00:17:30]  Sheffield's sex tape.  His wife had sex with R. Kelly?  Who didn't?  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, she looks a little too old for it.  But I guess it was ten years ago.  Supposedly she was a teenager at the time.  Right.  Eighteen.  Had sex.  R. Kelly just likes videotaping everything, I guess.  And he was having sex with her.  And you know it was just pissing and dirty, filthy sex.  That's great.  Have the Yankees pissed at you and the entire rap community. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  This guy's a brainiac.  That's an old kid, though.  He's going to be a grease spot.  Yeah, but then some guy who represents himself as R. Kelly, some kind of spokesman for R. Kelly in the past, has come forward.  And now he's trying to get money from them, extorting them.  The reverend is, yeah.  Yeah.  The reverend.  Yeah.  The right reverend is extorting them, saying, you know, cough up some bucks or I'll release this tape.  She's a gospel singer. 
[00:18:30]  And I guess that's not good for your audience if you have R. Kelly pissing in your face.  Although it kind of fits the gospel theme if you're holding his mule and just going, oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Because it's a threesome.  It's with her and another girl.  Oh, it is.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  R. Kelly doesn't mess around, man.  Nice.  Certainly doesn't.  The guy wanted 20,000 bucks.  That's what he asked for as a consultant.  A consultant?  Yeah, he's like, I'll come on and consult, you know, like, you know, in her grief or in the sadness. 
[00:19:00]  Like, he's basically saying, give me 20,000 for the tips.  Would it have been 20,000 to make this go away?  I doubt it.  Yeah, but it doesn't go away.  It's, you know, that's the first installment.  And then these guys come back.  Well, good.  It's out there.  It's, you know, could have gotten into trouble trying to kill the guy because that happens sometimes.  You got to go over there and make him a little grease spot.  But, man, nice.  All right.  And then on the back page of the New York Papers, this whole Red Sox-Yankees thing will not go away, even in the offseason. 
[00:19:30]  Boss and Pedro tango in Tampa.  Were they really tangoing?  They got a Photoshop picture of George Steinbrenner, obviously the owner of the New York Yankees, with his arm around Pedro Martinez.  And then the headline is, come to daddy.  The Post just doesn't care.  What kind of self-respecting newspaper uses Photoshop to put him in?  They have Steinbrenner with his arm around Pedro. 
[00:20:00]  I think this is against what the news is all about.  It's against all any type of journalistic credibility.  Because most people are dopes out there.  No offense to our listeners, because I think they're very intelligent.  But most people are dopes, and they're going to believe that this was a real shot.  It is the Post, though.  You've got to understand.  They're a rag paper.  They're fun to read.  That's the only reason their paper has any circulation whatsoever.  But they're a rag.  You don't read them for accurate news.  You really don't. 
[00:20:30]  And another thing that bugs the shit out of me about the Post and Fox News, both owned by that Rupert Murdoch,  is that whole, when you read about the suicide bombings, and they call them homicide bombings,  and their logic on this is they want to put the importance with the people that were killed in the bombing  and not the people that did the bombing.  If you call it a suicide bombing, you're putting the importance on the person that had the explosive strapped to him 
[00:21:00]  and not the busload of people.  But it completely, it's inaccurate is what it is.  It's this stupid political correctness that they're trying to do.  I don't even know what it is.  It's not even political correctness.  It's stupid.  The same line of thinking, but just not being PC.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's inaccurate.  If somebody's killed in any type of bombing, it's a homicide bombing, you jerk off.  If you plant it somewhere on a subway platform and leave, it's a homicide bombing if it killed people.  Yep. 
[00:21:30]  A suicide bombing is one of these monkeys strapping explosives to themselves and walking into a crowd.  It always bugs me when they've got to say it.  And you can see it on some of the reporters' faces on Fox.  They don't want to do it.  Yeah.  But, you know, they've run a tight ship over there at Fox News, and they have to?  Homicide bombing.  Call it what it is.  And what kind of news organization, by the way, and I guess they all, this just goes to prove,  they do it on this side, they do it on the left.  What kind of, it sends down directives?  Ah, this is the language we're going to use. 
[00:22:00]  No longer, uh, siege and destroy, it's, uh, search and rescue.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Full metal jacket?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really irritating, man.  I know, they didn't want to call, um, snipers, snipers.  They're sharpshooters.  Fox News will not call American snipers, snipers.  They call them sharpshooters.  The insurgents are snipers.  The same things the insurgents do, getting on buildings with their rifles and scopes,  they are called snipers because snipers is a more ominous, darker word than sharpshooter.  And Fox News has put out a directive to all their people. 
[00:22:30]  That's what they're supposed to do.  It's amazing.  I do believe you watched OutFox.  I watched OutFox.  OutFox is a great little documentary on, uh, on the Fox News channel.  Are they giving a good beating?  Oh, they beat the crap out of Fox News.  They do a whole segment where it's a montage of, people say, people are saying, that's what they do.  They, instead of having an actual source like, uh, blah, blah says that, you know, to make their points, they'll go, well, people are saying, people are saying Bush is doing a fantastic job in Iraq. 
[00:23:00]  And, and it's not just a, an isolated incidents.  They showed time and time, a whole montage of their report is gone.  People are saying, you know, John Kerry doesn't have what it takes to be president.  What people are saying.  There's no, there's, you can't back that up.  You don't even have to.  And most people won't think of it and go, that means nothing.  That means nothing.  What it means is Fox News is saying, or this reporter is saying, people are saying, they don't even have to check any facts when you say people are saying. 
[00:23:30]  It's a very interesting documentary.  It really is.  And I never thought twice about it until I saw that.  And then you realize, oh my God, they're saying people are saying.  Oh, they do it every day.  It means nothing.  Ever since I saw OutFox and then I watched the Fox News channel, you see it over and over again.  And the Fox News alert.  How about the Fox News alert?  This thing chimes in.  I get a rush of adrenaline. 
[00:24:00]  I instantly think back to what happened on 9-11 because that was, you know, special report.  You freak out.  You tune in and it's Martha Stewart is going to be appealing her conviction.  Yeah, the news alerts mean nothing.  That's a news alert?  They don't mean anything anymore.  What the hell is that?  It's just an attention getter.  And they use that all the time.  Right.  It keeps you tuned in.  It keeps you watching.  And, you know, it works because Fox News consistently beats out CNN in the ratings. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, but OutFox, if you see it, it's a tough film to get a hold of, I think.  It's not a blockbuster or anything like that.  I think it's, I think you could get it on HBO On Demand or something.  Oh, okay.  You could send for it, too.  Very interesting.  It's available at Amazon.  Very good, yeah.  So, last night I went and saw The Incredibles.  Did you see the little cartoon?  Well, I got my mom in town, so I'm a little cranky and a little groggy today.  Are you cranky?  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Our family going through a lot of personal crap. 
[00:25:00]  Lost my pops three months ago and now, you know, trying to get mom going and my turn  to hang with mom.  Are you one of those people that just doesn't really want to deal with any of that stuff?  Well, no.  We're all stepping up.  We're trying our best, you know.  It's a tough time for us.  And no, it sucks.  There's a lady out there that killed my father and still hasn't come forward to say sorry. 
[00:25:30]  Oof.  And, you know, it's driving me nuts every effing day.  But, not to bring the show down.  Jesus.  A little late.  Huh?  No, we'll get, whatever.  But, I mean, it's part of reality.  It's part of my life.  It's part of this show.  You mean a little late for her not to come forward?  Huh?  Yeah.  You mean he's a little late for her not to come forward?  It's like, where is she?  Why is she not?  What kind of person are you that you don't, like, drop a note, say something?  I mean, you know, it was a car accident out front of my parents' house.  They were going to lunch about three months ago.  And this lady just creamed him. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, absolutely creamed him.  She jammed on the brakes the last, I think, at the last second.  And she broke her toe so bad the bone popped through.  I mean, she was trying to stop.  That's what I'm hearing anyway.  You know, I don't have the full police report.  But this lady has not even said one word to our family.  Wow.  My dad wasn't driving.  He was in the backseat with my mom.  So my mom is, you know, healing and stuff.  And we're, you know, trying to get her, you know, to move on with her life in a way, right? 
[00:26:30]  So she came to...  Movie night.  It was movie night.  There you go.  I'll go back to that.  So she wanted to see Bridget Jones.  Oh, brother.  I'm like, Mom, no.  I mean, I'll do anything for you, but I'm not watching Bridget Jones.  That should tell men how bad that movie is.  I mean...  When the son won't take the mother and lost the husband.  Right, exactly.  That movie.  When you even have to step in and go, no, I'll do anything, but I have a line.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, oh, come on.  I mean, if I was banging some hot broad and she wanted to see that, then I'll step up, 
[00:27:00]  knowing that, you know, I'm going to get something, too.  Sure.  But I'm not getting anything from my mom, and I don't want anything from my mom in that  way.  So I'm like, oh, Mom.  So then we're at the movie theater, and The Incredibles are playing.  Let's go watch The Incredibles.  I don't want to see a cartoon.  I'm like, Mom, they're not cartoons like you remember growing up.  This isn't like, you know, Bugs Bunny.  I mean, before the feature.  It's funny how you have to explain this stuff to your parents and older people. 
[00:27:30]  It's like, it's not cartoons like you remember cartoons being, you know?  It's a movie.  You forget you're watching some kind of animated or computer animated movie.  Yeah, it's an animated flick everyone knows about.  It's the hottest movie in America, and it's the first animated action flick.  It's unbelievable how good this movie is.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  And you're watching it going, this was all done with computers.  Amazing.  It truly is.  You look back at the early ones from Pixar, and you remember how cool it was to see them. 
[00:28:00]  Even Toy Story and stuff.  As an adult, you can go and watch that.  It's not bad.  Even if you watch Toy Story, and then compare it to The Incredibles, and even Finding Nemo.  I go to all these movies in the theater.  They're great.  You can even see the improvement from Toy Story to The Incredibles especially.  It's just getting out of hand.  Leaps and bounds.  And then you checked out Half-Life 2 last night?  Oh, I've been waiting since, I guess, 1998 is when the first one came out. 
[00:28:30]  And I was just, you know, I played that for sometimes 20 hours at a clip.  And I was married at the time, Opie, if you remember.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, did I catch some hell.  Oh, did I catch some hell for enjoying myself with a video game.  My God.  That was your marriage distraction.  It certainly was.  I forgot all about that.  That's what got you through the last few years of that marriage before you decided to move on. 
[00:29:00]  That's right.  I forgot, man.  It was Half-Life.  You were Half-Life, man.  I was Half-Life, man.  I was Gordon Freeman, the lead character in the game.  That was me.  And most games, they pump out sequels, you know, every year you get a sequel.  And they're just progressively worse and worse and worse.  This, they waited, you know, since 1998.  They've been waiting for this game.  And it came out yesterday. 
[00:29:30]  And I ran right to the store.  Eager beaver that I am.  I'm looking for a GameStop.  And found one.  Picked it up.  And it is just as good as they've been claiming it was going to be.  It's pretty much another step up in gaming.  Are you going to blow off Grand Theft Auto now?  You know something?  I've kind of let Grand Theft Auto take a backseat to EverQuest 2, which came out, like, last week.  And I've been leveling up.  Opie, I'm happy to announce I'm a level 13 sorcerer. 
[00:30:00]  I'm a level 13 sorcerer in EverQuest 2.  I thought you looked different.  See?  I wear my pointy sorcerer hat and my robe into work now.  Isn't that amazing?  I see it.  And I have my little wand.  We were going to comment about that a little later.  And through the show, I sorcer.  That's what I do.  Because I'm a sorcerer.  That's what it was.  Your magic scared that smell out of me.  Oh, is that it?  The guys on the show will never grow up.  We just will not grow up. 
[00:30:30]  No, incapable of growing up.  We certainly are incapable of growing up.  So, I kind of played that, which took me out of the mix for GTA.  But I have GTA on the PlayStation in the bedroom.  Yeah.  So, sometimes going to bed early because, you know, we got this thing to wake up for in the morning.  And I'll lay back and, you know, get in there with the homies and play a little GTA.  But then I got into the EverQuest 2.  And now, yesterday, Half-Life 2 came out.  The graphics that they're talking about. 
[00:31:00]  And I saw a film like a year and a half ago about this game.  Anthony, yeah.  You showed me the game.  Maybe even two years ago.  Yeah, it was close to two years ago.  Oh, no, a year and a half ago.  A year and a half ago.  About a year and a half ago.  And some ass stole the codes or whatever and delayed the whole game.  Delayed the game.  But what they were saying about it a year and a half ago, the high expectations everybody had for this game, it came true.  I was playing last night.  Everything's interactive in the game. 
[00:31:30]  You could pick stuff up.  The facial expressions, the graphics on the people, they have a lip-syncing technology that they use.  Where it's not just the mouth opening and closing.  They actually mouth out the words.  And you might say, oh, is that a big deal?  The graphics are a big deal.  It's part of what brings you into a game.  It's part of what makes a game really good and a game just run and shoot, you know.  Some of these run and shoot games, they get boring after five minutes.  There's no real story to them.  The graphics suck.  The gameplay sucks. 
[00:32:00]  When you get a game where the graphics are great and the sound on this game is amazing.  You're walking through.  You're hearing creepy shit.  It's a surround sound.  So you're hearing stuff behind you.  You dim the lights a little bit when you're playing.  It gets creepy.  It gets really creepy.  It's like a good horror movie.  But you're in it.  And you're kind of the driving character.  The graphics, again, the surroundings.  The outdoor graphics.  You look up at the sky and it looks like a real sky.  The buildings, detailed, amazing. 
[00:32:30]  And the gameplay is great.  And some of the way you can kill these things.  But then again, your system is ridiculous for gaming.  I'm sure the game is still unbelievable and the graphics are great.  But I've seen your system.  It's ridiculous, man.  I went to some of the gaming message boards and people are saying,  you know, I dig the game but it's clipping on me.  Some of the graphics kind of stutter.  The sound is stuttering.  You know, you've got to turn off some of your graphics and stuff.  If you have a good system, you could crank everything up.  It runs smooth as silk. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, I have a ridiculous system.  It's just unbelievable.  Ridiculous.  But, you know, I play games a lot.  I need it.  That's what I use it for.  By the way, my mom did enjoy The Incredibles.  I forgot to mention that.  Oh, she liked it.  She was like, wow, okay.  Cartoon.  Yeah, she's totally digging it now.  So I did that.  You did that.  I've got to just mention one more thing.  This weapon that they have in this is called the anti-gravity gun.  It's a gravity gun.  You can pick stuff up.  Anything in your environment, you pick up with this gun and you can launch it at like supersonic speeds at whatever's coming at you. 
[00:33:30]  So I was running a little low on ammo in one section and there's just zombies and all kinds of these creatures that have been taken over by these aliens coming after me.  And using nothing but a radiator, I pulled off a wall and a fan blade.  You just hack apart these zombies coming at you.  You kind of get positioned where they're coming at you in a big crowd and then launch this blade at them and they get cut completely in half. 
[00:34:00]  There's ragdoll physics on the characters.  So they flop to the ground like a real dead person would.  And then some of them are cut in half and you hear behind you.  And you look and he's crawling with his hands coming to like bite your ankles.  You just hack them apart.  It's fantastic.  I love it.  The sound is really great too.  When you light these things on fire, they start screaming.  And you riddle them with the machine gun. 
[00:34:30]  It's just a fantastically violent, creepy game.  Do you feel bad when you kill the people?  Hey, sometimes it was a little odd because one guy...  I remember you on the old show, you were talking about Half-Life and they were starting to get it together with the facial expressions a little bit.  And you sort of said it's getting to the point you kind of feel bad killing your people in these games.  You kind of feel a little bad.  There's these creatures called headcrabs that jump up on people and get into their brain and turn them into these zombie-like things.  When you light them on fire, the headcrabs sometimes pops off their head and you can hear them back as the person they were, but they're on fire. 
[00:35:00]  And they're like, help me!  Oh my God!  So you got to mow them down with a machine gun, you know.  Because you don't want to hear them screaming.  Out of sympathy.  You just want to shut them up.  Yeah.  So that's what we did.  Grenades are great too.  You throw the grenades at these crowds.  Yeah.  And the pieces of them and whole bodies go flying through the air.  And you can see them.  They just fly up like rag dolls, hit the ground, still burning. 
[00:35:30]  And however they land, that's how they land and that's how they stay.  So you'll come up on these deformed, burnt bodies where the leg is over the top of their head.  It's not like the same body laying there twice.  Again, you might ask, what's the big deal?  But it's just part of a game that really brings you in.  Yeah.  And Jim, what did you do last night?  Um, did a set at the Comedy Cellar and, um, went back and worked on my, uh, book proposal.  And that was it.  Oh!  Oh!  Well, something we're supposed to be doing, by the way. 
[00:36:00]  I got that email too.  Yeah.  Hey, maybe we can, she's trying to be so nice about it.  Lydia.  Well, we just got one section left to write.  I know.  And then I think it's a go.  She's very nice about things because I've gotten the same email like three times and I'm  the asshole because I'm not like chiming in and writing.  But it's the same thing.  Hey, maybe we can take a little time and, you know.  Yeah, we, uh, we're getting a lot of attention to, to write a book.  You guys should, man.  A lot of attention.  Book good.  It's going to be a lot different than the other radio DJ books that have been out there 
[00:36:30]  in the past.  So, um, what were we going to do?  Can I have my picture in there?  Huh?  Can my picture be in the book?  No, no, no.  A little pop-up book.  I don't think so.  Your penis.  I don't think so.  Pop straight up.  We could either take a break or we could get into the, uh, the top 20 songs from Rolling  Stone Magazine's 500 greatest songs of all time.  I never agree with these.  I never agree with these. 
[00:37:00]  Especially Rolling Stone.  Too cool for the room.  They stink.  I don't know.  Most of these are pretty accurate.  Yeah.  Most of these are pretty accurate.  You know something?  I got a comment.  Your taste in music, a little different than mine, and a little different, I think, than  the general population.  I think you, you go over a little to the too cool for the room choices sometimes.  Who, me?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I like Nirvana?  No, no, not Nirvana.  Nirvana is like one of those.  Give me a two.  Give me one.  Cake is a little too cool for the room.  I love cake. 
[00:37:30]  I like cake, but it's a little eclectic and something you wouldn't want a little too  much of.  Radiohead?  Radiohead I like.  Yeah.  Radiohead's very cool.  The band's one of the best CDs of the last 10 years easily.  Easily?  I'd be older than that.  Huh?  Might actually be older than that now.  When I think about it, that came out a while ago.  What does Radiohead say?  Actually, you know what?  It's about 10 years ago.  It came out like 95.  I was going to say 95 maybe.  You're right.  You're right.  Huh?  What's their big song?  Their hit was Creep.  Creep.  I'm supposed to be.  I'm a creep. 
[00:38:00]  I'm not quite sure.  Dude, it was played on every rock station in America.  I don't listen to rock stations, man.  I don't deal around it.  I don't.  Yeah, but you're just living life.  You should know this song.  Not in my circles.  No?  No.  How much for that?  Music flying out of her ears.  Oh, the only really real rock station that plays anything modern rock here is K-Rock,  which I don't like.  It's too alternative.  I like Q1043.  You like the classic rock, do you?  Even that, the selection stinks, but I'm more likely to hear something I like on that station. 
[00:38:30]  I just never liked alternative rock.  Like the same 20 classic rock songs.  I know.  Dude, it's awful.  I can't even argue.  Teenage Wasteland.  Oh, yeah.  Who's that?  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God.  Are you being...  I'm not...  One of your favorites, The Who.  Oh, all right.  No, I don't like The Who.  I know you don't.  We know you don't like The Who because Ozzy's never been in it.  That's not true.  Keith Moon is a fine drummer, I will say.  I respect them as a band.  I just never enjoyed their stuff.  Do you guys want to go from the top 20 or just the top 10? 
[00:39:00]  Can we start with number one?  You got...  No, no, no.  You got Creep?  Oh, yeah.  Play Creep.  So, Jimmy, I'm sure you know this.  I'm sure I've heard it.  Sure you do.  Probably one of the bigger rock songs.  I'm into rap, though.  I pop lock a lot, so a lot of times I don't really catch the new rock songs.  You know this, right?  Come on.  Can I hear a lyric?  You should know it from the music.  Yeah, stop.  It sounds like something from Blue Velvet.  Can I jerk off and strangle my girlfriend to this?  Yes. 
[00:39:30]  Here we go.  Here it comes.  It's a song about you.  It really is.  Great song.  Who knows?  It's all right, yeah.  Oh, it's all right.  I'm not knocking it.  I'm sure I've heard it.  It doesn't ring a bell.  You've never heard this before.  Not to my knowledge.  Not to my knowledge.  Wow.  Where have you been?  I don't know.  And I'm open to music.  I listened.  You got me into some music.  No, you're not.  Surprisingly enough, he got me into a couple of things, which I thought were going to really 
[00:40:00]  stink, but I wound up enjoying in the long run.  I got you into White Stripes a little bit?  A little bit.  And Nirvana, who I don't love, but he made me listen to Unplugged.  I'm like, damn it, that really is good.  That's really Unplugged.  That's great.  That's amazing.  Here's the hook.  Nice, right?  Not bad.  It just reminds me of every other rock song from the last ten years.  It's kind of like...  Oh, no.  This is special.  Any better. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't do that.  Really?  Oh, he's the worst.  That's a great song.  All right.  You can pay that out.  Yeah.  I wish I liked new music.  It would be a lot easier for me, because that's all I play on the radio.  Certainly would.  All right.  Well, you know, you turned me on to Johnny Cash.  I mean, I knew who Johnny Cash was, but Norton loves to crank Johnny Cash on the way to his  gigs, and I ended up buying everything from Johnny Cash because of you.  Yeah, you got to hear 13, his Danzig cover.  Fantastic. 
[00:41:00]  Are you kidding me?  No, dude.  Tell me you're kidding.  Really?  Dude.  Because you don't know what Johnny Cash, he was remaking all kinds of weird songs for  him.  Yeah?  It's unbelievable, yeah.  So you like newer songs if Johnny Cash does them.  Anything Cash does, you have to respect.  Well, I'm a Cree.  My J-J-J-Generation.  What's he doing here?  His version of Hurt is just...  It's amazing.  People try to put us down, talking about my J-J-J-Generation. 
[00:41:30]  That would be good.  That would be good.  Johnny Cash, well, he was doing that.  He was remaking...  He's remade...  Tons of songs.  I'd say at least a couple dozen.  That was Rick Rubin.  And Rick Rubin was doing all that with him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What a genius Rubin is, man.  He's just an odd guy with a big beard.  You ever see Johnny Cash's episode of Columbo?  Oh, yeah, where he flies the plane or something?  Yeah, the two-parter.  That's a great one, yeah.  That's why I'm not a big fan of his music.  It's more his acting. 
[00:42:00]  You like the Johnny Cash acting?  Well, Lieutenant, good to see you here again.  Like, well, yeah.  It's Johnny Cash acting.  All right, so the top 20 songs from Rolling Stone magazine's 500 greatest songs of all time  and torn...  Of all time.  This is going to make me sick.  So this covers everything.  Of course it's going to make you sick.  I bet it bugs you, too.  I bet there's at least a few in the top ten that you...  It absolutely does.  Well, there's one that's not that I cannot believe.  Don't give away any of these.  I can't see them.  You tore it out of the paper roughly. 
[00:42:30]  I know, because you ruined things.  I don't ruin them.  You ruined our bit about old games.  I would have...  Old video games.  Rape me again.  No one told me.  Rape me.  All right, in 20th place, it's Let It Be from the Beatles.  Let It Be.  Are you okay with that choice?  How can you not like that song?  It's great.  There you go.  The Beatles, best band of all time.  I remember when I was a little, little, little tot.  Little tot. 
[00:43:00]  A babysitter came over, and Paul McCartney was performing this live on some TV show.  And it was when the song first came out.  This chick burst into tears because he had, like, this big beard and mustache and big,  long, greasy hair.  It was when they started, like, looking cool.  Looking like hippies?  Instead of, like, the young, you know, Beatles.  The young Beatles from the movies and stuff.  This girl couldn't.  She lost her fucking mind.  And I'm sitting there as a little kid, freaking out, too, because the babysitter's crying. 
[00:43:30]  And I had no idea why, because I'm just a kid.  So now you're crying?  Yeah, I was freaking out.  I'm like, ah!  And she, I just remember her, with her hands in front of her face, screaming, crying, going,  he looks so old!  He looks so old!  He was probably 26.  Oh, yeah.  God.  But now every time I hear this song, I have, like, this trauma thing.  I remember the babysitter crying.  That's hilarious.  I'd like to dress up like Mother Mary and make it all better for you. 
[00:44:00]  Please, just whisper in your ear, some redundant nun.  The theme of this song really is dumb.  It's all this old bitch said.  Look, the priest you work with is touching me.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Just let it be.  Sesame Street did letter B.  After letter A comes letter B.  That's so clever over there.  They really are.  All right, we'll move on with the list.  What's the next one?  It's 19, would that be?  19th place, Anthony.  What's good with math?  What is 20 minus 1? 
[00:44:30]  Let me look really fast.  I believe this is the only Elvis Presley song.  Well, that makes sense.  In the countdown.  I don't think you should throw Elvis that much.  I think 19th place is a good place for Elvis.  It's Hound Dog, everybody.  Really?  Sort of a benchmark kind of...  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Looked at as one of the true first original rock and roll songs  that made it into the real open general public,  not the ripped off black guy music. 
[00:45:00]  No, I think he stole this from a darkie.  Of course he did.  That's what Elvis did.  There was another version of this, right?  I like how you're using the language of the time also, Opie.  The colored.  That was a good little added feel to that.  It was a colored person that originally...  The colored guy.  Colored.  It might have been a woman.  But he was open about it, too.  How black musicians influenced him a lot.  Elvis always was open about that and gave him credit.  Was?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, this guy has a worse story than you about the Beatles' Let It Be song, Anthony. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  Eric in Kansas.  Let's go, buddy.  Hey.  Hey.  Listen, I've got bad memories about that song.  I'm visually impaired, and I had a horrible start to life.  When I was five years old, my mom was killed in a car wreck,  and the rest of the family said,  Hey, fuck you.  Let's just send you to a goddamn institution,  which was the School for the Blind in Kansas City,  and the first week I was there,  I was laying in my bed, 
[00:46:00]  and the house manager,  the guy that was running the dorm,  come in,  and this song was playing on his fucking radio,  and you could hear it down the hallway,  and he was, like, trying to funnel all of us,  and he grabbed a hold of me,  and he was, I knew that,  I knew he was trying to go for the anal,  and I just instinctively,  I was five years old,  and I just rolled as fast as I could,  I just rolled, 
[00:46:30]  and I threw my elbow up,  and thank God I hit him right in the throat with it,  and I just kicked off running out in the lobby,  and I was like,  oh, man,  that song,  I hate hearing that song,  but you're,  God,  that's bad,  you're blind,  and at five years old,  you're almost raped as this song's playing down the hallway,  that'll kind of ruin the song for you,  I guess you don't want it in the top 20,  I don't want it in the top 20,  you know,  I tell you what,  I'm a fucking,  I bet you Mark David Chapman's your hero, 
[00:47:00]  never heard of the guy,  actually,  I'm,  I tell you,  I tell you who I listen to,  I listen to Ozzy,  Iron Maiden,  Judas Priest,  Tesla,  ACDC,  good boy,  you're going to get raped again by Jim,  that's right,  I'll give you a good teabagging,  while talking about why you looking at me,  never made onto one of his CDs,  well,  at least if I was raped by Jim,  Jim Norton,  I know he wouldn't fucking,  I know he wouldn't,  he'd make it pleasant,  I know he'd at least get down there and smell it before he went in, 
[00:47:30]  no,  I would not stick it in your bad eye,  that's a good idea,  alright Eric,  thanks for the memory,  bye,  yeah,  ouch,  can I ask a question,  how is Hound Dog the only Elvis song in the top 20,  are you going to tell me Love Me Tender,  is not,  I mean come on man,  that again,  that's too cool for the rule,  is exactly what that is,  yeah,  I'm not saying it's got to be number one,  but how is like Love Me Tender,  not up there,  usually these lists are filled with too cool for the room songs, 
[00:48:00]  this list isn't that bad,  it really isn't that bad,  we got a clip from Elvis when he was asked where he got this song from,  I got it from a negro,  of course you did Elvis,  didn't sound much like Elvis,  alright,  18th place Anthony,  top 20 songs from Rolling Stone,  Rolling Stone magazine's 500 greatest songs of all time,  it's Chuck Berry,  and Maybelline,  Maybelline,  ah there it is,  he was a sick F too huh,  oh, 
[00:48:30]  there's stories about him wanting to,  wanting to lay under glass tables,  while girls take dumps on the table,  didn't want to take the commitment like Jimmy,  and just let the logs hit him,  that's what everybody says,  Chuck,  Chuck was just a half stepper,  you're going to do it,  do it,  I'll lay there and look at it,  don't read it,  sign it,  just sitting there,  looking at the logs,  longingly above you,  yeah,  what a waste,  dropping on that glass table,  although when you,  when the liquidy ones fly on you,  you're like,  ah, 
[00:49:00]  too bad the table's not here to help this situation out,  like you said,  can't come back to biting the fanny as they say,  ah,  disgusting,  yeah,  you're telling me,  when you have Mount St. Helens firing onto you,  remarkably unpleasant,  no refunds,  alright,  so there you go,  Chuck Berry,  Maybelline,  17th place,  yeah,  this is the only Jimi Hendrix song,  that's good,  one time 20,  in the top 20 though,  man,  there's not enough room,  yeah,  you're right,  Purple Haze,  yes, 
[00:49:30]  ah,  yes,  a rock and roll staple,  Anthony,  not played enough on classic rock radio,  oh,  I cannot listen to these songs anymore,  Hendrix comes on,  I'm sorry,  I'm punching right out,  can't take it,  it's like,  why didn't the guy come out with some new stuff,  what,  what the,  he's one of those guys,  that continues to come out with new stuff though,  really,  oh my god,  he started the whole trend,  his family,  his father,  before Tupac, 
[00:50:00]  his father,  who finally dropped dead,  so his son could rest in peace,  was just taking advantage of his dead son for years,  like 30 years,  really,  oh my god,  yeah,  pocketing the cash,  pocketing the cash,  you know,  putting out all sorts of other CDs,  and albums,  selling his stuff,  big time,  he's had more albums come out in the last few years,  probably than anybody,  there's a blues album,  there's this collection,  there's that collection,  you got those magic tapes,  you might as well use it,  right, 
[00:50:30]  technically that is the father's seed,  you imagine if you dumped a load,  and all of a sudden it made you 50 million,  I mean,  how resentful would you be,  oh,  someone is reminding us of another Chuck Berry story,  yeah,  I forgot about this,  Chuck in Iowa,  what's up Chuck,  what's going on yo,  get it,  what's up Chuck,  I've been ahead all my life,  let's go,  come on Iowa,  hey,  I had a story about Chuck Berry,  he used to live out there in Wentzville,  Missouri,  he had a restaurant out there,  and you guys were talking about him being a six buck, 
[00:51:00]  you know,  they used to have video cameras in the girls' restroom,  I forgot about this story,  it's true,  oh,  yeah,  he got in a lot of trouble for that,  yeah,  he made trouble for that,  it's costing him a whole lot of money,  he used to have parties out in his house,  cops are out there,  they like perimeter their house out there,  it was,  it's a wild bunch out there,  all right,  there you go,  is he alive Chuck Berry,  I don't know,  didn't he die recently,  or no,  I don't think so,  I think he's still kicking,  he's still rocking,  I think he's still kicking, 
[00:51:30]  he's still doing the duck walk,  at like 85 years old,  across the state,  he's got right with that little,  oh,  stop,  it was cutting edge,  back in like 1953,  the one foot bouncing,  and leading the other foot,  look at him go,  oh yeah,  black men just don't age,  in general,  is that it,  oh my god,  I don't know what it is,  all right Chuck,  thank you,  I love your show,  keep it up,  all right,  thanks for checking in Chuck,  let's go to 16th place,  on the list here,  Anthony,  another Beatles song,  if we got it all queued up,  it's I Wanna Hold Your Hand, 
[00:52:00]  ah,  there you go,  the Beatles were pop,  what number,  it's keeping score over here,  16th place,  very good,  greatest songs of all time,  huh,  yeah,  well,  but you gotta think,  probably the influence on it,  that's probably where this is coming from,  yeah,  yeah,  that's what I'm thinking,  it's a little more than just,  listening to it,  and enjoying it,  as one of the greatest songs,  I think these are more influential, 
[00:52:30]  okay,  maybe they,  they're from a period of time,  where it,  really made an impact on music,  by the way,  there's no Black Sabbath,  or Ozzy on this list,  really surprised,  well Ozzy I can understand,  but you're gonna tell me,  they could have thrown Paranoid in there,  um,  of course,  let me tell you something,  that Faggity Magazine,  never even had Ozzy on the cover,  until the Osbournes was out,  are you kidding,  that made me sick,  wait,  is that true,  I think so, 
[00:53:00]  Rolling Stone never had Ozzy on the cover,  my parents,  bought me a subscription,  to that rag,  when I was in high school,  and I refused to acknowledge,  it was sitting there,  wow,  awful,  who knew,  Green Day,  put Green Day on the cover,  Bob in Jersey,  what's up,  oh,  I just wanna know,  when you guys are gonna be funny,  oh,  oh,  hey Dick,  not everything we do is funny,  figure it out,  what do you mean,  I want my $2 back,  maybe we can be as funny as you,  with this phone call,  this is great, 
[00:53:30]  I'm,  I'm,  you have nothing,  go away,  I'm telling a story about how my dad died,  in a fiery car crash,  and you idiot,  it's not all about funny on this show,  god,  wake up,  top 20 songs from Rolling Stone magazines,  500 greatest songs of all time,  and 15th place,  The Clash,  love this song,  which one?  London Calling,  oh,  okay,  oh,  were you a big Clash fan growing up,  Anthony? 
[00:54:00]  no,  there was like two schools,  back then,  back in the olden days,  when this was new,  there was the punk rockers,  that liked this type of music,  and putting up,  clothes pins,  not clothes pins,  safety pins,  through their nose and ears,  and wearing,  ripped up clothing,  and then there was the southern rock guys,  that would listen to Skinner,  and Molly Hatchet,  and Charlie Daniels,  and wear army jackets,  and the Allman Brothers, 
[00:54:30]  yeah,  the Allman Brothers,  and I was more from the southern rock guy school,  than the punk school,  I was,  I was all about the who growing up,  well,  the who too,  The Who and Zeppelin,  no,  that I liked,  but that was part of the,  The Who and Zeppelin,  and took a peek at like,  London Calling,  I was being like the rock guy,  you'd be the rock guy,  but you could,  the punk guys never,  the hardcore punk guys never listened to stuff like The Who,  or Zeppelin,  it was all about,  this,  the cars,  the Ramones,  the Ramones, 
[00:55:00]  yeah,  Joe Jackson,  stuff like that,  you didn't like the cars?  No,  oh,  who's gonna take,  they blow,  Kanjo,  oh,  they're awful,  how about Bye,  Bye Love,  who's gonna take,  yo,  first of all,  that wasn't even Rick,  that wasn't,  I don't care who it is,  it stinks,  yeah,  their first album,  their first album isn't better than any,  any Sabbath album,  no,  exactly, 
[00:55:30]  now you're treading,  now he knows,  but the cars are from Boston too,  so,  exactly,  the first cars record,  every song on there was good,  let the good times roll,  good times roll,  let the good times roll,  moving in stereo was a great song,  I don't know moving in stereo,  that was a great song,  bath time,  that was some bath time,  what is it,  tell me,  I don't know the name,  one of the most legendary moments in movie history,  when Phoebe Cates comes out,  this song,  wow,  Eric's really good in there today, 
[00:56:00]  this show is definitely getting more gooder,  he's working it,  it's all starting to come together,  I like the cars,  because they're,  why don't you like this song,  I don't dislike it,  but it's a non-entity to me,  yeah,  let the good times roll,  yuck,  moving in stereo,  yeah,  this was a good one,  and then she gets topless,  come on,  right,  well if she could do that on a shitty album,  I wouldn't mind it so much,  doesn't anyone fucking knock anymore,  it's not all about Sabbath and Ozzy, 
[00:56:30]  I'm not saying it is,  but this,  I hate overrated classic rock bands,  they bug me,  oh,  overrated,  the cars are overrated,  the cars may have gotten faggy,  as their career went on,  but in the beginning,  they were a pretty cool band,  I'm not saying they were,  you might think I'm crazy,  oh,  that's when it really started going bad,  yeah,  but the first album is,  all right,  yeah,  they had one good album,  applause,  applause,  applause,  they stink,  the second album was pretty good too, 
[00:57:00]  Jim,  I'm sure it was fantastic,  but then Heartbreak,  that was Heartbreak City,  that was 84 with Thrive,  and you might think,  I'll tell you one thing,  what Sabbath represents to me,  it's like,  it's not even about Sabbath,  it's about the arrogance of like,  again,  predictable,  like,  you know,  again,  too hip for school type shit,  like Rolling Stone magazine,  putting this in the top 20,  I mean,  whatever,  this is the top 20,  this isn't in the top 20,  which one is their song,  which song by then,  we didn't,  the cars aren't even in the top 20,  relax,  how did we mention them,  you brought it up,  you brought up the cars, 
[00:57:30]  yes you did,  did I,  yeah,  you said,  you were saying rock bands,  cars,  I just went,  punk,  yeah,  the punks would listen to a certain type of music,  and the rock guys,  listen to their music,  the southern rock guys,  listen to theirs,  all right,  well,  this is just terrible,  we could fade out the cars,  we could interrupt this program to be,  the ozone midget sighting of the day,  all righty,  Mike and Brentwood,  what's going on buddy,  not much, 
[00:58:00]  just heading to work,  I found a midget over in Comac for you,  all right,  carrying a small roll of carpet,  which probably was quite massive to him,  it was shorter than everything,  he's standing there,  I'm sizing them up next to everything,  he's standing there,  like the big homer guy out in front of the floor,  he's smaller than the sign,  all right,  so the midget's walking with the carpet,  yeah,  if he had to push that wagon around,  he would have had to put his hands way up over his head,  and stand like that,  all right,  Jesus,  all right,  thank you Mike, 
[00:58:30]  you're welcome,  meanwhile,  back at the show,  speaking of which,  I think Frank Caliendo,  is going to be calling in today,  really,  yeah,  I think that's Steve trying to imitate Frank Caliendo,  it is Steve,  all right,  it's the top 20 songs from Rolling Stone Magazine,  500 greatest songs of all time,  in 14th place,  Anthony,  what was 15th,  I'm sorry,  it was The Clash,  London Calling,  okay,  okay,  can't keep tabs on all this,  a very influential band,  I've never heard that song,  you've never heard of London Calling,  no,  oh my God,  I swear to God,  no,  I'm not saying it's wrong, 
[00:59:00]  I just never heard it,  so I,  now I'm going to,  I got to give you a list of stuff to listen to,  I'm amazed,  at some of the stuff,  because this isn't like you have to be a fan,  or sit there and listen,  this is,  as you went through life,  this stuff was just thrown at you,  nah,  I was pretty careful about where I put my ears,  yeah,  you know,  I liked Kiss in the 70s,  that was my thing,  and Sabbath in the early 80s,  Real Rebel,  wow,  I'm saying,  you were out on the edge,  I was young though,  man,  come on,  I was very young,  I was 12 when I was,  1980,  I was 6.68,  wow, 
[00:59:30]  all right,  14th place,  Anthony,  exactly,  you know,  I,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  14th place,  it's Bob Dylan,  blowing in the wind,  yeah,  blowing,  all right,  you don't like this one,  talk about overrated,  yep,  this son of a bitch,  does nothing for me,  he's an awful singer,  always has been,  one of the worst performers to see live,  awful, 
[01:00:00]  of course he is,  he sings this crap live,  and you don't even know,  you have to ask the person next to you,  what was that song,  oh,  that was blowing in the wind,  you're like,  you're kidding,  right,  he changes the,  the sound of his songs in concert,  to the point that you can't,  unrecognizable,  unrecognizable,  doesn't even acknowledge the crowd the whole time,  that's what people want,  stares at the floor,  looks like he just doesn't want to be there,  but they talk about what a genius writer he is,  that's why,  you know,  the guy,  he might not be the best singer,  or performer,  but what a writer,  this is crap,  and this goddamn harmonica, 
[01:00:30]  when he starts,  there's no rhyme or reason to it,  you could,  you could,  put this in the mouth of someone having a stroke,  and it would make the same sounds as Bob Dylan playing it,  I saw him at Bonnaroo this year,  I wound up performing down there,  and he was one of the headliners,  along with Dave Matthews,  who I wouldn't see at Rifle Point,  that faggot yuppie hero,  so I decided to see Dylan out of respect for his legend,  you know,  I'm like,  the guy,  you're here,  man,  you go see him live,  he's not exactly 30,  a Lengen, 
[01:01:00]  yeah,  he's a Lengen,  and,  you know,  I always said,  one of these days,  I'm going to get to see him,  and,  I was down there,  and it was just awful,  I wanted to enjoy it,  but honest to God,  you don't know when one ends,  and the next one begins,  you have to just look for the applause breaks,  I'm so with you,  I was so disappointed when I saw Dylan,  horrible,  I could not believe it,  Manny,  Manny,  who used to run the comedy cellar,  who passed away,  ran a place called Fiend John in the Village,  and Manny's a musician,  for many years,  and years ago,  Bob Dylan came in to play,  and Manny thought he stunk, 
[01:01:30]  so he booted him,  and wouldn't let him play,  in his place,  good,  yeah,  and this guy goes around in his name,  what's the story about,  Elizabeth is still a nobody,  what's the story about,  they had collected down there too,  you gotta hear this Anthony,  this is unbelievable,  at the comedy cellar,  it's right next door to Cafe Wa,  and it's owned by the same people,  Manny Dorman,  and his family,  his son,  and years ago,  when they took over the Wa,  and the cellar,  the cellar used to be a music place,  they found all these,  like old Janis Joplin, 
[01:02:00]  Jimi Hendrix,  all of this stuff,  Richard Pryor,  stuff from the 60's,  that was recorded at the Wa,  that they taped at the Wa,  this isn't gonna end good,  and Manny,  just to save space,  he threw it out,  millions of dollars,  back then,  he just didn't realize what it was,  I mean,  he took it over in the 70's,  I would assume there was a lot of people,  not taping that stuff back in the day,  Cafe Wa is so legendary,  and there were,  you know,  these guys weren't even that famous,  at that point,  so why save it?  Pryor used to open for Miles Davis there, 
[01:02:30]  he would open for Miles Davis at Cafe Wa.  Millions of dollars.  And they just threw it all away.  Yeah,  yeah,  just to get rid of it,  to save room.  Yeah,  classic,  that hurts my stomach when I tell that story.  13th place,  Anthony,  another Beatles song,  it's Yesterday.  I don't know,  it seems like it's out of the same mold as Let It Be.  Yeah.  How about In My Life?  It's something a little more peppy.  I want to hold your hand,  it's the third Beatles song. 
[01:03:00]  Another depressing song this is.  Jeez.  This is sad.  The controversy over this with,  it was listed Lennon-McCartney,  and Paul for years has been trying to get it listed as McCartney-Lennon.  Relax.  Yeah,  exactly.  Why don't you just shut his billionaire face?  Oh,  they all just hate each other.  It's hilarious.  Yoko hates Paul,  and yeah,  right leg flesh,  left leg wood.  He's trying to get it,  you know,  right leg wood.  You know where we have to send Eric's sex bagel?  It's the Strawberry Fields. 
[01:03:30]  Oh,  really?  Oh,  there are Beatles freaks.  Every single day.  All stoned losers.  Laying flowers down on the Imagine logo there.  You know,  I think a lot of those people think that he's actually buried there.  I bet you if you ask those stupid tourists that congregate there every day,  they think Lennon is buried.  Where is he buried?  I don't know.  He's not,  probably,  I don't know.  That's a good question,  actually.  Lennon's tomb.  Wow,  is he really buried? 
[01:04:00]  No,  I'm just kidding.  Maybe somewhere private,  probably.  But there are people there every day,  there are guys that look like Lennon,  that just play the guitar every single,  he's been dead,  what,  20,  almost 25 years?  I can proudly say I've never been to Strawberry Fields.  I don't even know where it is.  I live in New York,  I have no clue,  I don't care.  It's a piece of shit.  It's right by,  right by where he lived.  It's right by the,  there's nothing to it.  You know,  the famous Imagine logo that everyone has seen in the photograph,  that's just laying down,  and then there's just some park benches around it.  That's pretty much it.  I got to tell you,  that last album he put out before they shot him was awful. 
[01:04:30]  It was fun.  He's never into the Lennon solo stuff.  What was it,  what was it called?  Kiss,  Kiss,  Kiss Me,  Love was a good song.  Yoko getting involved with his music.  And then the tour is still,  every day,  taking shots of the Dakota where he was gunned down.  Of course.  Every day.  And they're mostly,  they're mostly Asians.  Mostly Asians.  Taking the photographs every day.  We should send Sex Bagel out there,  because there is a bunch of freaks.  Yeah.  And they're crying,  they're crying,  and then some people bring little,  little boom boxes, 
[01:05:00]  and just play Beatles songs all afternoon long.  When's his birthday or death day or something?  It's in December.  It's coming up.  We should go down there on the day he was shot.  Well,  that's when it's just a madhouse.  And then I get some audio.  Just a regular day,  these people.  All day long.  Yoko makes me sick.  And then Jagger was trying to put,  did you hear the stories about Jagger was trying to put notes  under the door of Lennon's apartment  for the last couple years of his life,  because he wanted to do something,  and Yoko would throw him away.  Really?  Yeah.  It was all kinds of stuff.  Maybe she saw it happen with David Bowie, 
[01:05:30]  and didn't want John exposed to that.  Can you blame her?  Stomach full of seed.  And maybe Paul should work on,  instead of worrying about the order of the names of that song,  maybe he should,  how do you not let a mulatto,  don't say it,  how do you not let a child molesting,  let whatever he is,  steal the rights for your songs,  you stupid limey?  How does that happen?  How did Michael Jackson get the Beatles catalog?  You've got to thank the lawyers for that.  I just don't get that. 
[01:06:00]  I don't get that.  You could be that creative with that type of stuff out there,  and then someday someone else gets to own it.  I just don't get how that works.  Why don't we play some of the bits we did three years ago, Ope?  Go ahead.  Yeah, you're right.  Oh, that's right.  We can't,  because Viacom owns it.  Yeah, because our catalog is just like the Beatles catalog.  Just like it.  You know, butt plug.  Butt plug is our yesterday, I do believe.  Of course it is.  That's right.  You're right, man. 
[01:06:30]  I like that one song.  It was unreleased.  The George Harrison number,  There's a Lump on Me Head.  All right, you idiot.  Speaking of George Harrison,  how about that sick F,  the doctor in Staten Island?  When he was sick,  the guy who was getting Harrison to sign all the stuff,  the doctor was...  Do you know how that was?  Dr. Phil Lederman.  Remember him?  From the Staten Island Medical...  That was that guy?  That was the guy.  Yeah.  Holy ass.  We used to play a commercial.  Cancer's not funny,  but we made cancer funny 
[01:07:00]  for about two minutes before we...  Well, we almost got fired for that, too.  Yeah, we did.  There's this guy,  you do the voice kind of, right?  It was this real droning,  depressing voice,  and he would come on  and talk about  how we can cure  at Staten Island Hospital  cancer of the neck,  chest,  leg,  arm.  Like,  and you go off,  and you're just,  you're feeling all nauseous  just thinking about this stuff.  Yeah,  he would just tell you  how awful cancer was,  and how awful...  Metastases of the head,  throat,  oral neuromas of the... 
[01:07:30]  You're just...  Ugh,  like,  I'm cringing.  We were cringing every day.  We had to play this spot  every single day.  The guy just bought  our show like crazy.  Completely dry read.  Yeah,  there was no music,  not...  Oh,  now they put that  disgusting,  morbid piano music.  Bling,  dee,  dee,  dee,  like the death music  behind it.  If you have cancer  of the throat,  lungs,  head,  head,  neck,  liver,  stomach,  chest,  It was almost like  the guy got off 
[01:08:00]  talking about cancer  in a creepy way.  So Anthony and I decided  we had enough of this  like,  just morbid read  and the monotone voice  and stuff,  so we decided  to put circus music  behind his read.  It really perked it up.  Breaking news!  When you hear  brring,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  sign stuff?  That's the same guy? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah,  it was a big thing.  He was,  Harrison was dying  and he was getting him  to sign his son's guitar  and all that stuff.  The signature wasn't  even legible.  It was,  oh,  it was a complete mess.  He was signing  a Winston Churchill.  I don't have a problem  with that though.  The guy's in your office  there,  pick up a pen.  Jim would go in there  and get a picture.  Why not?  You can't get the whole  tumor in.  Hey,  look,  before you,  before,  I don't even,  just,  nothing.  We can clear the phone lines.  There's nothing going on there.  We'll start over.  Top 20 songs  from Rolling Stone Magazine's 
[01:09:00]  500 greatest songs  of all time.  It's Sam Cooke  in 12th Place,  Anthony.  Yeah?  Sam Cooke.  What song?  I don't even know  if I know this song.  Are they still  protesting him in Boston?  A change is gonna come.  I'm Sam Cooke.  Do you know this song?  No?  It sounds like a show tune.  Oh yeah,  this was in Malcolm X.  It was in the death scene  of Malcolm X.  It was great.  Oh yeah,  alright.  Now I know it.  Great song. 
[01:09:30]  No,  no,  this shouldn't be on the list.  Why is this on the list?  I don't know.  Alright.  It's another  too cool  for the wrong choice.  Alright.  That's the white people  having to get something  they think is really  bluesy and black  just so they don't...  That's right.  Alright,  we have nothing on Sam Cooke.  That is a good song though.  Get rid of Sam Cooke.  To answer your question,  Anthony,  it looks like Yoko  has John Lennon's ashes  right there in the Dakota. 
[01:10:00]  Oh,  he's still there then.  He was cremated.  Ashes given to family  or friend.  No,  Yoko has John Lennon's ashes.  I'll tell you though,  his son does pretty well  with the women.  You see him on page six?  Which one?  Sean.  Sean Lennon.  Sean Lennon.  He's always got hot chicks  with him.  Sean Lennon.  I hope so.  I saw Sean Lennon  open up for the Strokes  at the summer  whatever in Central Park there.  And I gotta tell you man,  Sean Lennon sounds  just like his father.  It's unbelievable.  And that guy could be 
[01:10:30]  an unbelievable musician  and he could write  some great songs  but it's so obvious  that Yoko needs to die  because Yoko  is influencing Sean Lennon.  Yeah.  He's all artsy  and stuff to the point  it's not even cool.  It's just awful.  Avant-garde.  Avant-garde is a better word.  Yes.  And it's just awful.  But if you listen  just to his voice,  this guy could be  unbelievable  if he would just  go his own way  and stop listening  to his stupid mother.  Listen to mommy.  I had dinner one time  at a place  and across the table  was, I think it's Vince Vaughn.  Who's the guy  that got blown in Brown Bunny? 
[01:11:00]  What's his name?  Not Vince Vaughn.  Brown Bunny.  Yeah, you know him?  Vincent Gallo, yeah, yeah.  And Rick Rubin.  It was one of the ladies  of Sean or Julian Lennon.  I really wanted to bug him  for a picture  but they were eating.  I'm like, god damn it.  It's a Lennon.  I should have asked him.  He's a Lennon  but I'm like, I just couldn't.  During dinner?  No, no, on their way out.  Oh.  Yeah, during dinner is bad.  Yeah, even I won't bother.  I saw John Boyd one time  in an L.A. restaurant  with his family  and I didn't bother him  and I wanted to.  I just wanted to do  Ratso Rizzo impressions 
[01:11:30]  until he spit in my face.  Alright, we'll move on here.  In 11th place, Anthony.  It's The Who.  The only Who song on the list.  My Generation.  Ah.  I don't understand  why you hate this song, Jimmy.  It's alright.  Whatever.  People try to put us to death.  Yeah.  I don't know my generation  The stuttering gimmick.  Yeah.  I don't know my generation  Yeah, again, this is on the list  because it's more 
[01:12:00]  of the time  than it is a really  who's song.  I think this is the best  Who song?  Really?  Won't Get Fooled Again.  Won't Get Fooled Again is up there.  Yeah, that's good to life in there.  I like the rock opera stuff.  You don't like Tommy?  That was a pretty amazing album.  It wasn't.  Yes, it was.  Tommy, can you hear me?  Remember the Tommy  can you hear me?  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Is that from the album?  Huh?  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Alright, let's move on here.  We could go through this list  a little faster.  In 10th place, Anthony.  Well, we keep yapping  about other things.  That's alright.  That's how these work.  We're just kind of hanging.  We haven't taken a break.  We've been on the air an hour.  I love you.  That's alright.  See, that's how they work.  We start off doing a list  but then we just go  all kinds of places.  I think it's fun.  You never know  where it's going to end up.  Oh, you just don't.  Alright, in 10th place,  it's Ray Charles.  Ah, there you go.  Ray Charles passed  recently, Anthony.

See the girl  with the diamond ring  Yeah  She knows how to  shake that thing  All right  Yeah  Hey, hey  Dig that ass  Very nice  Yep  It's all right  Yeah, it's good  All right  Ninth place, Anthony  America  America  Don't you know  what God done shit is, Grace?  I love how he throws in  little things  on that sacred song  I don't mind that  If it's good  If it's cheesy  Not when he does it  It did it  Ah 
[01:14:00]  Some people get a little  carried away, though  Todd in Vegas  What's up?  Yes  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey  Hey  You know why they  stuttered on  My Generation?  They were on a  soundstage  and just by  just by accident  they  stuttered at work  You guys are killing me  Oh, my God  We're killing you  You stink  You just stuttered  through that whole  freaking explanation  You lost confidence  through that awful  explanation 
[01:14:30]  about two lines in  I'll give you a break  because it's 4-10  in Vegas, man  Alright, Todd  Bye, Jesus  Goodbye, mister  Alright, ninth place, Anthony  The top 20 songs  of all time  Nirvana  Smells like teen spirit  Love this song  to this day  It is good  I wouldn't put it  in the top 10  so I might put it  in the top 20  Yeah 
[01:15:00]  Well, this was  revolutionary  Yeah  So  You definitely  got to  Did you get into  Nirvana, Anthony?  A little bit?  Absolutely  I was a huge  Nirvana fan  Like a retard  It's a lot better  than the  What was the song  that was up there  the London one  This is much better  than that  You don't like  the Clash?  No, I don't like  the Clash  I hope my  Sharona's in the top 10  Relax  It's not going to be  This list isn't that bad  Kaja Gugu  Too Shy 
[01:15:30]  Ooh, hush, hush  Very good  Alright  Lon Gelman  from Glen Oaks, Queens  You're a tool  Ant is a tool  He says  You can't stand  listening to  quote  the same old rock songs  Then Dylan in concert  changes around  his same old songs  and you don't like it  because you can't  recognize them  Great logic  That makes no sense  what you're trying  to pin on me  You jerk off  You didn't say it  I said I can't 
[01:16:00]  stand listening  to the same 20  rock songs  on Q104  and hearing  like I can't listen  to Jimi Hendrix  anymore when it  comes on  Doesn't mean I want  to hear a remake  of the same old  crap song either  or a different way  that the singer  sings it  so it's unrecognizable  I hate  Jackass  I hate in general  you go to a concert  and they mess  with the songs  Yeah  Yeah a little bit  that enhances the song  that's great  but what we're  talking about  Bob Dylan sings  his songs in a way  you don't even know  what song he's singing  Right  Self-indulgent 
[01:16:30]  and totally disconnected  from the crowd  completely  At least Ozzy  has the dignity  because of dyslexia  to reverse the verses  and forget the lyrics  I have water  dumped all over him  Yeah well  maybe he's incontinent  so what  I'm gonna call him  Lon Smellman  instead of Gelman  Oh you  I showed him  Alright  In 8th place  another Beatles song  I think this is  the last Beatles song  in the top 20  It's gotta be in my life  It has to be  Songs of all time  And you notice  all these Beatles songs 
[01:17:00]  the McCartney ones  Let me see  What would they think  was so cool  Maybe cutting edge  It's something off  of Sgt. Pepper  right  I was never good  with that  I don't know  Wow yeah right  there are McCartney songs  so far  This one is too  It's another McCartney Beatles song  It's Hey Jude everyone  Oh my god  That's a good song  but  In My Life  In My Life  Dude that's one of  the best songs  It's one of the best songs  ever written by anybody  This again  just like the other ones  This is one of those songs  like Let It Be 
[01:17:30]  Anyone get raped to this song  out there in Radioland  Let's think  That was a great story  Hey Beyond guy  Any Jews  that had people sing this  Hey Jew  and throw things at you  I'm sure that happened  It's kike  You idiot  You kids are so cruel  John from Oklahoma  What's up John  Hey man  What's going on  Hey  I just told them guys  to quit fucking  wrinkling up that paper  when they get done  reading something  That shit's real loud  on the radio  That's Ben sir  and I try to tell him  not to but he has 
[01:18:00]  no respect for the listeners  I've heard that  something about the processing  with us  makes crunk  crimping paper  crinkling paper  it gates out  all the things  everyone's saying  Oh really  and it makes it  the loudest  like crinkling paper  is louder  Yeah just tell them  to just slide it off  in the fucking trash can  and be done with it  They ain't gonna wrinkle it  That'll be all mad shit  Paper beats voice  Oh let's do it  all morning now  just to bother him  I'm gonna let you go man  Alright  How I'm doing 
[01:18:30]  And Manny  he just gave me a note  Manny from the Comedy Cellar  Manny Dorman  was not David Lee Roth's uncle  Manny Roth used to  own the old thing  Oh my god  there's a fire in the studio  What I can't hear you  the crinkling paper  is canceling out my voice  Alright so what are we gonna  Alright  in 7th place  Anthony  Chuck Berry  I'm right already  with him  Johnny B. Good  Johnny B. Good  They couldn't  they couldn't find  the greatest songs  of all time  you'd think they would  never repeat an artist 
[01:19:00]  Did Maybelline  have to be in there  this should be in there  but not Maybelline  some cheating whore  with an awful name  This is like  his staple  Yeah  This is his show closer  his encore  I like Michael J. Fox's version  better in Back to the Future  His hand was disappearing  I also like his version  of shake  rattle and roll  and shake it up  Isn't that the cars too? 
[01:19:30]  Shake it up  Yeah  Oh they stink on ice  Well I can't argue  the shake it up thing  Just terrible  I will defend  their first album  Let's see how racially  balanced this  I guarantee you  because the Rolling Stone  notorious liberal  very racially balanced  Alright  Let's say hi to Chris  Chris what's going on buddy  What's going on  Hey how you doing Chris  thanks for calling the program  Thanks Jimmy  Who is the fucking  fourth voice out there  man he's horrible  he's ruining your show  It's the O.B. Anthony  and Jim Norton  and producer show 
[01:20:00]  So you don't like Ben?  What's wrong with Ben dude?  Well Chris wants to say that  nothing  Chris wants to say that  nothing to the show  Chris wants to say that  Ben talks too much  Ben talks when we're  talking about music  because he's very knowledgeable  Right  I don't think Ben talks  that much on the show  No but Ben just pipes in  with a fact when he has to  Sometimes he'll get too close  to the console  and his big hog  will push the entire console  back a little bit  so he has to talk  Wow  And we love his  He doesn't like Ben  And we love his  hurricane hair  Don't look funny  But Ben's not trying  to be funny 
[01:20:30]  Ben's just like giving us  facts or whatever  and Ben  you should see his face  right now  Nothing shakes him  He could care less  that people don't like him  He's not even awake yet  He doesn't know  what you're saying  He's laughing  He doesn't give a shit  I like his giggling  in the morning  Nothing shakes him  It keeps us going  Alright 6th place  Top 20 songs  of all time Anthony  It's the Beach Boys  Good Vibration  You don't like  the Beach Boys either?  They're all right  It's a genre  It's a good song  But  Is this 
[01:21:00]  You had a  I don't know  You had to be a real fan  of this kind of music  Because there were people  that love it  or hate it  This is a good song  I can see this one song  Alright  Yes  Yeah  What a bunch of  kooks they were though  Oh without a doubt  Another Michael J. Fox song  Taking up good vibrations  Charlie Manson  loved the Beach Boys 
[01:21:30]  Did he?  Oh yeah  Alright  This phone call  has to be taken  Anthony from Long Island  What's up?  Yo  Owen A  Hey  How are you Anthony?  Alright  Listen  Norton  You are a musical  misfit  You fucking idiot  You have no idea  what good music is about  Sir  That's a  That's a pack of lies  No  You're just a schmuck  You don't know  what music is  You ever study music?  You have any idea  what music is about?  No  What do you mean  study music dude?  No  Who are you?  Itzhak Perlman?  Aha  You didn't think  I knew that one  didn't you?  Listen 
[01:22:00]  Listen  I have  Dude  It's all subjective  It's all taste  That's true  Yeah  But all the shit  that you hear  and you said  Oh why does that  have  All that shit  laid down  to what  even Metallica  had to play that music  Dude  I'm not knocking  the blues  like Sabbath  is blues oriented  I'm not dumb  but I just think  sometimes the songs  they pick  are a little  like did  Maybelline have  to be in there  like did  you know what I mean  I just think  certain classic rock  songs become overrated  Alright I'll agree  Oh look at that  You turn them around 
[01:22:30]  Well I also know  I am musically  very very stuck  in my ways  and I'd rather listen  to God of Thunder  than most classic rock songs  which I know is my  me erring  I'm aware  I'm an ass  But listen  to all the listeners  out there  shut the fuck up  and let ONA  do their show  let them crinkle paper  if they want  That's right  even if it's just  the crinkling  of a little confused  boy's feet  in a paper bag  crinkling is always good  We just like to  We just like to  keep the sounds  real on this show  There's a lot of  There's a lot of guys  you know  they have cough buttons  and things like that 
[01:23:00]  What is this?  If someone farts  or  Alright what's the problem?  Oh boy  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy  with his coffee  Oh no  Are we gonna have to  break into  this bit  with a reading?  What is this?  What's the problem Jimmy?  I don't know  Kill him!  I don't know  Oh boy  Derek  Why is your face  turning red?  Warm up your vocal cords  you might be reading  You might have to  warm up that  Where do we get  our coffee every day? 
[01:23:30]  What's going on?  No one knows  what's going on  Look at that cup  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know  Exactly  But if it said  Starbucks  you'd know that immediately  Oh yeah  Ben don't explain  what's happening  on the air  because people  hate your voice  Stop ruining things Ben  You're ruining the show Ben  I don't like  This is why  two reasons  I don't like this coffee  It doesn't taste good  and I don't like  supporting the savages  that run most of these delis  Yeah I know  Starbucks is a big 
[01:24:00]  you know  big world order  type of thing  Yup  You betcha  but at least  they're not funding terrorism  I will not support  the savages  How much money  from one cup of coffee  from like a dollar  cup of coffee  do you think  goes to Al Qaeda  I'm not saying  necessarily Al Qaeda  I would say  probably 15 cents  out of every buck  You might be right  Yeah  And even if it doesn't  go to Al Qaeda  it just goes to a guy  who will watch  a video of the insurgents  and go well  I see their point  and I just don't want him  to have my 15 cents  You don't want to support  that my friend  Absolutely not  You're insane 
[01:24:30]  I'm not insane  I won't support it  Did you get that cup of coffee  from a raghead  No I got it downstairs  Exactly  The ones that won't let  they won't let me in  sometimes I come in  at 5 to 6 or whatever  Oh we're closed  I'm like can I buy coffee  No  That's a normal like  joint though  That's not one of those  corner delis  Whatever it is  I don't like it  I like Starbucks  I like the big company  that mushes the mom and pop  awful companies  Only because their coffee  is always stale  So did you tell him  to go to Starbucks  and he didn't?  You want to taste this  and see how enjoyable this is? 
[01:25:00]  Why don't you throw it  against the wall  I'm not a diva  I'm not a diva  I just want Starbucks coffee  I want Starbucks coffee  I'm a diva  Why are you picking up  your Rent Boys book?  I don't know  Look I like him  He's a good kid  He's got a great smile  but we all  we all know the rules  Oh god  the show's going to  turn gay again  It's not going to  turn gay  I just pray  there's a couple out there  that wants to try to  become the sexiest  state in America  When you ask  the intern for coffee 
[01:25:30]  and they know  where you like your coffee  from and they come back  Yeah why did you  go downstairs?  First of all  he didn't say anything  about Starbucks  and I haven't been  on a coffee run  in like three weeks  Oh really?  Three or four weeks  Really?  Well I haven't saluted  the flag in a little while  but I still know to do it  when it's in front of me  Oh god  Is that valid?  Either way  as your punishment  because you're a fine young man  and you work very hard  but this was inexcusable  there will have to be  another coffee run  for Starbucks  and you're going to  have to read  young man  It's a very short paragraph  from there to there 
[01:26:00]  and I want you to read  with dignity  and I want you to read  proudly  No laughing  Hold on  Anthony wants to explain  because there's a lot  of new listeners  This is the  Jim's punishment  This is the only bit  that Jim Norton  has officially brought  to the O&A show  Ever  He contributes  very nicely  on a daily basis  but as far as  bringing bits to the table  he usually doesn't  but he decides  to bring this one  to the table  He brought in  a lovely book  entitled Rent Boys  Don't fold it back  you're bending the cover  I like that picture  Rent Boys 
[01:26:30]  on the cover  is a nude man  young man  covering his  covering his  sensitives  with his hand  and another hand  tweaking his  nipple  on the cover  and it's filled  with stories  of gay sex  and Jim hands out  these punishments  to people around here  when they do  something wrong  and the punishment  is to read  from the book  you have to read  seriously  you can't laugh  it off  like make a joke  about it  because then it 
[01:27:00]  just comes off  like a joke  And what happens  if he laughs  during it  you want him  to pull his pants  down  and you can  paddle him  no  but if he laughs  believe me  I'll have him  reading so much  that his lips  will be too tired  to laugh  if he thinks  Kaufman did some  reading of  The Great Gatsby  he will certainly  be doing some  love Andy Kaufman  references  hey hey  she gets a mood  in here  it's like a  Mark Pereno show  with an intern  saying things  like this  great  you need a  PlayStation young  fella  Dave from Jersey  he says  look I never  went for coffee  there  but I know  Norton loves  Starbucks 
[01:27:30]  so  that's right  Dave from Jersey  and I like  the fact that  Starbucks is  always fresh  I'm not  whoring for  Starbucks  I just like  it tastes  the same  every time  I would rather  be like a  hippie cool guy  that's what you like  I'd rather support  a smaller  hey I don't go  with the big ones  man  but the coffee  always stinks  in these places  I'm sorry  it's different  every different  place  you go  every place  you're safe  at Starbucks  I like the flavor  there you go  don't read ahead  young man  just be surprised  as it happens  alright  let her rip  enjoy  he withdraws  slowly 
[01:28:00]  gently  he stands up  I reach over  and peel the rubber away  letting it drop to the floor  I hug him to me  and place a now  semi-flaccid cock  in my mouth  it no longer smells  scrub  I lick it  I roll over on my back  and hang my head  over the edge of the bed  I begin stroking my cock  intent now  on my own orgasm  he bends his hard prick  so that it slides easily  into my mouth  and down my throat  as he begins to fuck my face 
[01:28:30]  I close my eyes  and breathe in the marvelous  musky scent  of his sweaty  heavy ball sack  turn it off  I begin to cum  he cannot stop me now  turn it off  my pleasure is so intense  I begin to choke  on his fresh  on his flesh  deep inside my throat  smells like  oh he tastes delicious  victory  I will be generous  with my  with this boy  very generous  good job  thanks fella 
[01:29:00]  custom coffee  medium with skim milk  it's gonna smell like  his musty heavy sack  look that was harder  for us than it was  for you  that was difficult  I don't like to meet  out to punishments  that was a bad one  you could tell  that was really  really bad  dude I don't like  you think I like  handing these out  I think you do  it helps people  young Eric  had a misstep  the other day  and did some reading  and might I say  he has been in 
[01:29:30]  tip top shape  ever since  top 20 songs  of all time  according to  Rolling Stone Magazine  Anthony  we're into the top  five  are we  we've been talking  for an hour and a half  by the way  an hour and a half  hour and a half  alright  fifth place  Aretha Franklin  if it's R-E-S-P-C-T  I'm gonna put my  fist through the  fucking computer  mark  alright  there is an E 
[01:30:00]  in that by the way  uh  let you out  let you out  two mammoth tits  the only female singer  on the list by the way  keeping track at home  it's a good song  but is it top five  of all time  oh come on  yeah  top five  of all time  how ludicrous  there you go 
[01:30:30]  alright  we can move on here  absolutely  disgraceful  respect  fourth place  it's Marvin Gaye  and what's going on  here's another song  Richard Pryor's  favorite song  that's just here  because it was  it was for the moment  this is not a good song 
[01:31:00]  this comes on  I'm out  so quick  if you're driving around  that's what these  lists should be  if the average Joe  is driving around  and one of these  songs come on  do you continue  listening  or do you punch out  I punch out  on all these songs  it's awful  alright  that's a good song  I don't know  if I'd put it  top five  but top 20  I would  because again  it influenced  Marvin Gaye  I bet his father  liked it  no because  Richard Pryor 
[01:31:30]  loved the song  that's his favorite song  you're obsessed  with Richard Pryor  who isn't  that influences  your opinion  yes it does  third place  Anthony  John Lennon  by himself  oh  in third  imagine  I don't mind it  I'm out also  again driving  boink  really  I don't care  about this song  have you heard  Perfect Circle  doing this song  no  oh my god  what  good  bad  we don't have it 
[01:32:00]  why is he panicking  over there  he's panicking  it looked like  Zyklon B  was being  put into the room  I'll tell you  you know why  he's panicking  because this little book  has got the entire crew  in tip top shape  that's why he's panicking  I think we have that  in the catalog  you know you make  a good point  it's making people  work hard around here  putting the fear  of the book in him  you know Steve  has hidden  Steve hasn't been around  since you brought  that book  no he's not  Steve is practicing  his reading voice  I took his sack  into my mouth  he's practicing 
[01:32:30]  his diction  to make sure  he gets it right  is this it  yeah listen to how  creepy  Perfect Circle  makes this song  yeah they do it  in like a minor  John Lennon  makes it sound  like he's singing  it from  fluffy white clouds  in a place  Anthony  and Perfect Circle  makes it sound  like he's singing  it from hell  this is kind of  cool though  it's great yeah  it's really dark  and creepy though  when it kicks in  listen to the 
[01:33:00]  to the hook here  oh yeah  you wear like  black hoods  and kill people  yeah you put them  on a slab  and disavowal them  for this music  you gotta have balls  to try to cover  imagine  that's one of my  favorite things  for some reason  good covers  I love good  song covers  there  yeah this is  pretty good  it's got that 
[01:33:30]  little violin  strike thing  in there  it should have  been in  Devil's Advocate  creepy  I can't believe  this is my  number three  though  I've never heard  this first  no no  relax  want to hear  a little more  or what  it kicks in  a little later  I think  it gets really  creepy  not bad 
[01:34:00]  aren't these the  guys that cover  Shut Up by Kelly  Osbourne  alright we can  fade this out  blah blah  blah blah  I believe they  play that on  Squiz a lot  actually  alright 
[01:34:30]  that's not the  guy that's been  trashing us  that's the other  station right  yeah the guy  from the  Boneyard  right  and people  were making fun  of me or whatever  because this guy  wants to slap me  in the face  and I said  next time I'm in  Washington  I want to see  if he's going to  slap me in the face  and I will take  care of business  no problem  but then I guess  I didn't explain  I have brothers  that are really  psychotic  and ridiculous  and when Man Cow  was trashing us  on Fox  my brother  actually looked  into flights  to go to Chicago 
[01:35:00]  and beat the crap  out of him  so that's what  I was trying  to explain  like if I don't  get to the guy  one of my brothers  would no problem  that's all  I mean I fight  my own battles  trust me  people were like  oh you know  you're hiding  behind him  no I'm not  but see like  I'm trying to do  a radio show  one of my brothers  right now is trying  to figure out  how to get to  Washington  that's all  I'm trying  to say  but the fact  that you said  fight my own  battles  well the guy  said he's  going to slap  me  he's not  going to slap  he's just  being fingered  who says that  I'd like to  give him a slap 
[01:35:30]  he doesn't  I'll give you  a slap  get out of here  you ever see  Rodney and  what was that  Easy Money  oh yeah  great  alright  I haven't seen  that in a while  that was also  with Jeffrey Jones  the regular guy  look  excuse me  little fat  baby feet  kicking  in the runner  up position  Anthony  greatest song  of all time  second place  goes to the  Rolling Stones  the only Rolling  Stones on the  entire list 
[01:36:00]  I can't get  no  satisfaction  there you go  another one  great song  I'm done  I'm done  when I'm driving  and this comes on  well just because  it's overplayed  I don't even get  to the vocals  by the way  you know what band's  not in the top  20  Zeppelin  Zeppelin  which is pretty  amazing  Stairway to Heaven  is probably the  greatest song ever  made  I don't agree  it's the greatest  dude I told Ben  earlier go home  right now and  listen to Stairway to  Heaven  and you think  you've heard it  too many times  it's an unbelievable 
[01:36:30]  song  it is a great song  let's do it again  but I won't go home  I'm so done  with all that  music  I can't listen to it  well Rock Radio  wrecked it for everybody  yeah  because they decided  Rock Radio decided  there's 200 songs  out there that people  need to hear  and that was it  over and over  and over and over  again  and most of the  songs were great  but you throw  those songs in  with a little more  variety with other  bands and things  like that  and deeper tracks  and then you got  a nice rock station  but the stupid  suits that decided  to take over radio  screwed it up 
[01:37:00]  for everybody  it's time to  relegate these songs  to oldies stations  half of these songs  are on the oldies  stations now  put them on the  oldies stations  classic rock stations  start playing like  90s music  and 80s music  that's classic rock  and then the other  stuff  oldies  there  Zeppelin on  CBS FM  aww  Jimmy's hugging  I'm happy now  I prefer  painted black  to this anyway  this is a great song  but I prefer 
[01:37:30]  painted black  my favorite song  song is  Sympathy for the Devil  it's amazing  that's one of the  best songs I've ever  written  alright  because it's about  the devil  but it's  that is a great tune  that's your little  cardboard thing  around your Starbucks  it prevents my  little hands  from getting burned  Jimmy's little hands  are very happy  I am very happy  with Nathaniel  so corporate man  I love that  yeah they protest  Starbucks  wow you're really  going after the  powers that be  coffee makers  shipping lattes  to the military  assholes 
[01:38:00]  god is the left  irrelevant  what's number one  number one  greatest song of all  time according to  Rolling Stone magazine  this is just awful  I'm sure it is  Bob Dylan  oh  how does it feel  oh okay  wow  like a Rolling Stone  on the home of  rock and roll  oh  yes yes yes  this probably  should have been  up there like  where the other  Dylan song was 
[01:38:30]  yeah  people call  say beware  doll  you're bound  to fall  this is great  alright  whatever  good for Manny  kicking him out  no you can't  play here  stupid  bye  slam  he thought he  was pompous  and phony  and like as far  as like he was  trying to be an  artist and Manny  just wanted nothing  to do with him  yeah  beat it  good  and he's mentioned 
[01:39:00]  in Dylan's biography  hit the road  what does Dylan  say about Manny  Monachem Dorman  would not let me  play in this place  all the guys  would come and  jam it man  he's like no  see you later  not having it  fucking pompous  suburban  well this is where  they got the name  for Rolling Stone  magazine right  like Rolling Stone  oh I didn't  make that connection  oh so they're  kind of giving him  little props  yeah  there you go  wow  too bad the song  wasn't called  the two  it's not a  paranoid magazine 
[01:39:30]  I know that guy  hates me on the air  but they did this  list in 1988  because I remember  it when I was  way back when  Satisfaction was  number one  like Rolling Stone  I think was  number two  so  hey did you  shut that guy  up whoever's  talking  he really  he's ruining  the show  yeah that just  ruined everything  can we go to  the break dude  my flow is gone  I can't talk  after that  Ben just ruined  the show  what is going on  can we get  Steven here real  fast because I  want to talk  about something else  it'll be a couple  minutes and then  we'll take our  first break 
[01:40:00]  wow  I have an awful  itch  you know the  itch it's like  it's between  I mean it's the  taint but it's  like a deep  inner itch that  you can't get  to  you can only  get those by  squeezing the  tissue between  your thumb and  forefinger and  rolling like a  regular nail type  scratch doesn't  work you got to  get the deep  tissue itch where  you just pinch it  and twist a little  bit  makes you kind of  look up like a  dog and almost  want to scratch  with your hind  leg  you know  you hit there's

[01:47:30]  and michigan  i think in part  you know  to be a part  of this game  this spectacle  all eyes  of the football  world on you  and you know  it's an exciting  time and i think  it is fun  for the kids  which uh...  sometimes  distractions  aren't fun  and uh...  playing the  ohio state  michigan game  is fun  and it's  something you  dream about  and think  about constantly  and you know  i would have  to say that  it's a real  plus  that's what's  going on  at this moment  michigan goes  into the contest  at the very least  claiming a share  of the big ten  crown for the  second straight  year  wisconsin and 
[01:48:00]  the wolverines  are tied at  nine and one  with the badgers  in iowa still  in the race  for the conference  championship  coach lloyd car  says he's  looking forward  to the buckeyes  hospitality  we are uh...  looking forward  to going to  columbus  to play in  the greatest  of rivalries  and uh...  in that great  old stadium  in front of  that partisan  ohio state crowd  at one point  the big game  was headed to  corporate sponsorship  but coach car  was glad it  didn't happen  i just think  that uh...  in my own  judgment  uh... 
[01:48:30]  the pressure  that is being  placed on  particularly  the young people  who play the  game of football  college football  i think it's  uh...  far in proportion  to what it  should be  and i think  we should be  going the other  way  it's michigan  at ohio state  this saturday  and that's the  big ten today  on xm satellite  radio  this is peter  kessler  with today's  xm pure  golf radio  minute  bobby jones  was the original  child prodigy  he had the

[01:51:00]  vincent  d'onofrio  and i can't  i am so  tired of  carrie supporters  what a bunch  of babies  they call it  the bush flu  that they have  they've been  getting actually  physically ill  some of these  people physically  ill  over the fact  that uh  their candidate  john carrie  lost the election  what did you  guys hear about  i talked to eric  yesterday  there's an article  on rush limbaugh  that they  they uh  the psychologist  came out against  him because  he was making  fun  and offering  like as a joke 
[01:51:30]  psychological help  to people who  uh who were  supporters of  carrie  what was the  name of the  disease they  gave it  pest  uh something  election  uh selection  something uh  post election  selection trauma  or something  i swear to god  pretty funny  it's all about  they they're such  babies they're so  used to winning  that they're not  they didn't win  that's all they  didn't get their  own way  they're like  spoiled children  i'm very surprised  there was anybody  that thought he  was gonna win  like there were  people that really  thought he was  gonna win  i don't even think  he thought he was 
[01:52:00]  gonna win  he didn't have a  shot we said it  him and teresa are  fine they're not  breaking down  emotionally  oh they don't  care they're  relieved  i think deep down  they're relieved  he didn't want to  be president  who would want to  be president of  this country  who the hell  would even want  that gig  a lunatic  it's nothing  but do you see  you have to be  psychotic to be  president  do you see what  you look like  in those four years  do you see what  they look like  when they come  into office  when they leave  office  it is a mess  you get a  relatively young  guy that goes  into the white 
[01:52:30]  house and they  come out the  other end  this old  breaking apart  doddering fool  you get like  bill clinton  look at that  two terms  the guy fell  apart  he was a  young man  when he went  in there  give me eight  years he was  a mess  when he came  out  his hair went  white like  he saw the  burning bush  on the mountain  and his heart  problems  fat  he was a mess  well he was  fat in office  for a while 
[01:53:00]  there  it came off  looking real  bad when he  was done  he looked like  a kind of  a chubby  young guy  now bush  you look at  the early  pictures of bush  same thing  he's going  down the  same road  looking old  who wants  the job  forget it  the problem  I find with  the celebrities  that supported  Kerry is that  so many of  them have  such a  disgustingly  flated sense  of self  importance  and this was  a reality  check  you spoke  as loud  as you  could  you used  every bit  of influence 
[01:53:30]  you had  Springsteen  got concert  Sean Penn  took out  ads  nobody cared  you didn't  make a difference  that's the  problem  your voice  it was heard  but no one  cared  that's every  jerk off  college professor  some throwback  fuck from the  60s who's got  his hair in a  ponytail  hey man  the system  man  your voice  wasn't heard  back then  and now you  need to be  heard man  we all know  what it is  no one cares  sickening  I'm surprised  that you know  you're so liberal  and you're  you're saying  what you're saying  oh no no

[01:55:30]  I like  a very  feminine  clean foot  no odor  high arch  the perfect  pedicure  toe ring  ankle  bracelet  but I  had her  last night  and then  she took  and she  did everything  I took  and gave her  a load  of baby  batter  using the  baby  batter  again  hey footsie  by the way  I know you're  saying this to  O'Ban and me  my nickname is  Logsy  long way to go

[01:57:00]  footsie  I was talking  about what  the woman was  in her 40s  from Long Island  and had some  cosmetic surgery  yeah  the shows on TV  these cosmetic  surgery shows  like the swan  swan is great  and there's another  one out there  where they do  extreme makeover  no the real one  where they grab  real people  and they show  these results  that are amazing  it's not  that's not  the rule of  thumb  I think  especially 
[01:57:30]  when you get  if you get  these women  the women  that go on  the swan  and these  other shows  are usually  women  usually  that are still  relatively young  they've just  had hard lives  maybe they were  fat and lost  a lot of weight  they don't have  hard lives  they just don't  I'm talking  like ridden hard  and put up wet  but they don't  feel like taking  care of themselves  either  they eat bad  they don't exercise  yeah  I'm not talking  about  I could give a  crap  what they're doing  now they're  going for the  quick fix  the quick fix  I just love  you know  they always get  them on tape  hours after 
[01:58:00]  they wake up  not even hours  minutes after  they wake up  how do you feel  I'm gonna be  beautiful  I'm gonna get  cute  it hurts  so bad  it was  really good  she had a  problem with  the anesthesia  this could  affect her  in the pageant  in the pageant  the pageant  I'm actually  by the way  if I could  just  the pageant  part is just  to try to  make this  whole thing  legit  it's all about 
[01:58:30]  we want to  see how  horrific  they look  right after  surgery  you know  something  you could  tune that  show in  the last  10 minutes  you want  to see  a before  picture  and an  after  picture  that's  all you  want to  see  I don't  care about  their lives  I don't  care about  how hard  they're  working to  get through  this  procedure  and oh  we'll see  who gets  picked for  the pageant  I don't  care  I just  want to  see the  before  I want to  see the  pig  I want to  see how  hot they  can make  and when  they open  up that  curtain  and show  the mirror  and they 
[01:59:00]  go like  I'm  beautiful  slow down  have you ever  seen this  show  it's hilarious  I'm hosting  a show  like this  stop  extreme  makeovers  and we  only give  them to  burn  victims  and it's  sponsored  by  and an  eyelash  maker  and for  a second  I believed  you when  you said  you are  awful  oh boy  here we  go  here we  go  were you  done  Anthony  I'm sorry 
[01:59:30]  I was  just going  to go  into a  little bit  of the  cosmetic  surgery  the way  it is  in the  real  world  when these  women  the duck  mouth  isn't  working  girls  these  women  that get  into  their  I've  seen  in their  40s  start  doing  this  women  in their  50s  like to  do it  for some  reason  women's  lips  I don't  know  what do  they get  smaller  as they  get older  I don't  know what the  whole thing  behind it is  but they  kind of get  a little thin  and they want  to puff  them up  so they get  those collagen  injections  you ever see 
[02:00:00]  you live  in Manhattan  Opie  you've seen  them walking  down the street  the old bags  and they look  like  they got  these big  gook  lips  lips  and think  it's sexy  and that it's  making them look  like they have  full lips  I saw  Melanie Griffith  finally  live walking  around my  neighborhood  with Antonio  Banderas  she does that  first of all  Antonio Banderas  is like  5'4  I mean this guy  is short  I'm a little  man 
[02:00:30]  and yeah  I mean it's  like a duck  bill on her  yeah she's got  the duck  bill  it's unbelievable  in person  and when you've  had your eyes  done so many  times that they  don't match  up anymore  or you have  to sleep  with them  open  because they  don't close  anymore  they don't close  you ever see  when they haven't  done  yeah they have  a very hard  time closing  their eyes  oh yeah  and when you  sleep you're  very relaxed  so a lot of  times they sleep  and their eyes  are open  oh my god  but your eyes  it's so hard  for a doctor 
[02:01:00]  to really get  things to match  when they're  doing that  they just don't  have that figured  out yet  no they don't  and your eyes  you can get  away with it  once  probably  and maybe  if he's really  good and gets  a little lucky  you won't have  like odd eyes  but the more  you go back  the more it  compounds the  problem that  your eyes  don't match  and you get  these women  that have  like one  Japanese eye  on one side  and it's a  round eye  on the other  unbelievable  and then they  put the chin  implants in  the cheek  implants 
[02:01:30]  oh yeah  they have those  they have those  oh a chin  implant  Jimmy  look how excited  he just got  they could lipo  your cheeks  and put a chin  implant in  and give you  chiseled features  it's the new  Jim Norton  hmm  alright  but it does  I think the  shows are really  giving these  women these  false images  and they go in  and it's just  a nightmare  I laugh openly  at this one  it's just  it's funny  funny as hell  it really is  great TV  PJ from PA  what's up  hey I got a  problem with 
[02:02:00]  Jim  hi PJ  welcome to the  program  oh sorry  hey  wait wait wait  hold on  hold on PJ  Jim before you  start your rant  today just back  off the mic a little  bit  so it doesn't  distort  thank you  go ahead PJ  okay it's actually  TJ  but that's okay  it doesn't matter  Jim you know  you were pissed  at somebody  yesterday I believe  because they were  assuming that you  were a liberal  well you're making  the same kind  of assumptions  I'm a ponytail  wearing dope  smoking conservative 
[02:02:30]  yeah well you know  what alright  I did kind of  I wasn't talking  about the look  necessarily  there's plenty  of guys with  ponytails  that aren't liberals  I was only talking  about a typical  college professor  and I didn't mind  that guy thinking  I was a liberal  yesterday  it was just  the problem was  that when I  actually prefaced  what I said  was if the soldier  really felt like  he was in danger  and just reacted  I completely  understood  and he was taking  what I said  and completely  ignoring it  that's what I  got mad at  not that he  thought I was  liberal  okay that's  fine I just  wanted to let  you know  that there  and as far  as the  intelligence  factor too 
[02:03:00]  I'm one  smart mother  so don't  assume that  all your  listeners are  stupid too  not at all  okay  not at all  oh my god  that was  pretty easy  problem solved  one caller  at a time  I like that  all right  what is going  on with ABC  and the  Monday Night  Football  scandal  is it up  to scandal  yet  I don't know  ABC  apologized  Tuesday  for a steamy  intro to  Monday Night  Football  after receiving  complaints from  viewers in the NFL  the spot featured 
[02:03:30]  a supposedly  naked Nicolette  Sheridan who's  still freaking hot  we were just  talking about her  the other day  I think off air  we saw a picture  of her  I guess she's  jumping into the  arms of Terrell  Owens  right  yeah  before the game  ABC show  the actress  and the  Philadelphia Eagles  star in an  empty locker room  in an attempt  to spoof the  network hit  Desperate Housewives  Sheridan who  stars in the show  was wearing only  a towel  and provocatively  asked Owens  to skip the game  for her  right  so what's the  problem  they had a little  banter back and  forth a little 
[02:04:00]  flirtatious banter  and then  they show her  from the back  she's got the  towel on  they show her  from the back  and from the  lower back up  you don't see  her ass at all  yeah  they say  Sheridan was  shown only  from behind  and above  the waist  after she  dropped the  towel  and then  she drops  the towel  now you see  her bare  back  oh my god  that's not  what they were  complaining about  her bare back  yeah  I think we all  know  I think we all  know why  the red states  were a little  pissed off  at this little 
[02:04:30]  skit  if that was  you know  Corbett  right  Aikman  no one would  have cared  but she's  jumping into  the arms  of a very  black man  oh he is  a strapping  one too  and they  complained that  she was naked  this wasn't  appropriate  but you're right  if that was a  white guy  that she was  jumping in the  arms of  I don't think  you'd see  these complaints  come on  stop  I think so  stop  what  it wouldn't 
[02:05:00]  have been  as many  I think  that had a  lot to do  with it  well  we have  heard from  many of our  viewers about  last night's  Monday Night  Football's  opening segment  and we agree  that the  placement was  inappropriate  ABC said  they folded  we apologize  you apologize  can one of these  networks just go  you know what  we liked it  we thought it would  be cool  fuck yourselves  it's funny  go screw  what they were  trying to be  here's what  they're doing  they're trying  by putting  the hot white  chick  is she in  the movie  Housewives  never seen it 
[02:05:30]  but I think  so  oh okay  I was just  saying but by  doing whatever  I was going to  make a statement  the NFL  called the  intro  inappropriate  and unsuitable  for our  Monday Night  Football  audience  what time  is Monday Night  Football on  nine  nine o'clock  nine o'clock  on a school  night  how  how  how many  little kids  that are going  to be traumatized  by this are awake  it's just a bare  back  it's a bare  woman's back  what's the  problem 
[02:06:00]  we have  we have gone  deep this country  we really  we have really  gone deep  we gotta calm  down  people are  complaining  about this  stuff  and you  will see  companies  scurrying  to apologize  to do whatever  it takes  to get people  to not complain  and you know  how you get  people to not  complain  you dumb  everything down  that's one way  you make it  you put no  spontaneity into  it  nothing funny  because if  something's funny  to one person  it may be 
[02:06:30]  offensive to  another  so you can't  do that  we're just  down the road  where it  should be  welcome to  monday night  football  here is the  game  and then  play the game  although the  violence in the  game does  offend some  people so you  probably shouldn't  even show the  game  give them all  flags to pull out  of each other's  pockets  how many times  has a guy gotten  paralyzed on  during a live  game  there you go  almost twice  almost  we had the  jet guy  that's what I'm  saying  bird  that's right  dennis bird  he came back  from that  sort of  we're in this 
[02:07:00]  direction  I see no  sign that  we're pulling  back at all  ABC just  right away  they got some  complaints  what did they  do  did they even  assess this  situation  for any length  of time  what do you  want to do  apologize  quick  get an  apology out  there  send out a  press release  oh my god  we can't have  this  it was a  back  and the way  they were saying  it on the  news  made you believe  that it was a  nude woman  because they were  saying nude  woman jumps  you're surprised  that the news  gets things

[02:34:30]  I did cave  and go back  to that  I didn't go back  to the heart  transplant girl  though  no right  right  that was good  well I forgot  about the heart  transplant girl  forgot about her  too yeah  yeah  this guy is  really pathetic  hey dude  how would you feel  about banging  someone who took  a boat to the  back of the skull  if it was a girl  maybe you know  but  ah just close  your eyes  yeah  he won't notice  yeah probably  alright  so anyways  there's this girl  at work  who I ended up  banging last night  ooh  yeah  at work 
[02:35:00]  at the supermarket  no I know  this was home  on my day off  so  no but  she works  with you  at the supermarket  yeah  what does she do  man she must be  a real treat  yeah she works  in the grocery  I work in the dairy  ooh  what does she do  what does she do  ah just stocking  and stuff  ah little glances  at each other  over the cereal section  what does she  does she talk dirty  and say  fuck me like  it's the expiration date  no no  not like that  oh baby  open up  here comes some  curdled milk  no

[02:36:00]  yeah she just got out  of a  uh  marriage for like  6 or 8 years  so  you know she just  wanted some  non-committing  screwing around  there you go  how much does she weigh  yeah  uh  about a hundred  ten  oh cool  alright  alright  and what does she look like  any good  uh  well  that's where it gets  interesting  her face is a little  messed up  her body's great  lots of tattoos  oh she's a butter face  lots of tats  well  this is where  this is the reason  I called back  oh okay  we're not done yet  oh no  here we go 
[02:36:30]  there's always got to be  a catch  yeah  and uh  well  I was banging her  last night  and  she kind of shocked me  a little  when she took out  her teeth  and proceeded  to give me  the best blowjob  I've ever received  in my life  wow  the toothless one  you know what  that's just awful  disgusting  I got a toothless  I don't care  how good  the BJ was  nope  the toothless thing  is just not happening  man  ever  the only time  there's no  it's disgusting 
[02:37:00]  and it would remind me  of a baby  or an old person  there's no reason  to have a girl  take her teeth out  ever  yeah  a lot of those  choices are really hot  Jim  well I was thinking  both but apparently  picky picky  just should  put the lips  over the teeth  and that's that  Charles Brunson face  you must make a face  like Charles Brunson  and cover the teeth  if I had any game  you know I'd probably  have that same attitude  but you know me  I'm not arguing  I'll take what I can get  kind of thing  you know  alright well Mike  we're going to  cut you short today

[02:40:00]  and you get in the  car with your fat  friend Larry  and you go back  home and don't  mention it  wow man  oh man  someday we're  going to find out  what happened  to you as a kid  besides the  monster rain thing  I love how you  make up those  little stories  on the fly  like that  I was in a rest  area  that's when I  realized gay guys  crew rest  I was in a moment  for an open  mic at  rascals  I checked out  my mule  I was an adult  Larry's waiting  in the car  what are you doing  with the papers  Ben  you're crinkling  it up  and spoiling  the show  for everyone  I was just 
[02:40:30]  looking at the  email that  Kenny had sent  about your car  that's hilarious  oh yeah  we'll get  we'll get  into that  but  we've got to  talk about  this cheese  sandwich  where's the  cheese sandwich  is making  the news  wait is it  true that  Brian Williams  canceled on us  we were going  to have our  first almost  A-list celebrity  and he canceled  out on us  well they said  that he was  going to reschedule  I knew this  I knew this  one was going  to happen  I said it  the first  second  when you said  he was booked  I was thinking  there is no way  his people  are going to 
[02:41:00]  let him do  this show  he is the new  wonder boy  of NBC  television  he's taking over  Tom Brokaw's  spot when he  leaves in December  and he's going  to be the head  of the NBC  nightly news  claim there's  a scheduling  conflict  I knew this  was going  to happen  they said  oh we thought  you were on  on the west  coast  the scheduling  conflict is  he found a show  that has good  taste  and he's going  to do that  and just so you  know people in  Washington  Ben did get  the guy  and he cancelled  there's nothing  Ben can do  about that  that's because  of our reputation  we have  that's right  we have a bad 
[02:41:30]  rep  I curse our  reputation  we're like the  whores  we're like the  school whore  we have a bad  rep  I didn't do any  research on him  anyway  let's move on  we're looking for  a relationship  but we're now  the girl who can  suck a bar full of  men off in three  minutes or less  right  three minutes or less  that's what we  gotta live with  that's right  the three minute  challenge  and he made the  right move by the  way by canceling  because one of us  would have said  something atrocious  and stupid  I agree with the  he should have  cancelled  of course he  should have  I would not go  on this program  if I was him 
[02:42:00]  bonafide journalist  wants to hear  what Robert Reed  jokes  why would he  if I was me  I wouldn't go  on this program  we'd do it  right  no way  we would have  you know  I'd have done  some kind of  tasteless Tom  Brokaw impression  which would have  upset him  because I'm sure  they're friends  yeah the L's  and yeah  Tom why does Tom  run out of breath  that he would  and force the laugh  and then you would  have done a  brilliant impression  and he would have  had to make up  an excuse  right  would have been  awkward to say  the least  for him  alright where's  the cheese  sandwich story  sandwich  someone get 
[02:42:30]  over the cheese  sandwich story  no no no  oh yeah yeah  who's not getting  over the story  there's a cheese  sandwich  wait wait  this guy  what guy  it goes with  the toothless  thing we just did  Dave in Brooklyn  what's up  hey guys  how you doing  good  did you guys  see the toothless  hag trying to  sell that cheese  sandwich on ebay  ok yeah  that's what we're  getting at here  hilarious  she's got like  one tooth on the  bottom in the  middle  and in the front  she's got no  fronts on top  and she's got  teeth on the side  but she's got like  a $50 hairdo 
[02:43:00]  maybe because she  tried to eat the  cheese sandwich  finally because the  thing's like 10  years old or something  10 years old  hard as a rock  and she probably  lost all her teeth  she finally got hungry  and said man  I might as well  eat this cheese  sandwich  no one's buying  it  I guess what  there's an image  of the Virgin Mary  in this cheese  sandwich  always the Virgin Mary  these stories pop up  we talk about this  from time to time  twice a year  somewhere in this  stupid country  there's somebody  claiming they could  see Jesus or  or the Virgin Mary  in something  and then everyone  gathers and  loses their minds  and then they claim 
[02:43:30]  that there's  miracles happening  healings  healings and  people crying  and they see  the thing  actually weep  tears of blood  because that's  where the Virgin Mary  would show up  on some hillbilly  sandwich in Florida  on a cheese sandwich  and she just remains  in a closet  and this is going to be  our big payday  I heard it's up to  ten grand already  the bidding  well Anthony was telling  me about this  when we first got here  I guess the bidding  was a lot higher  but then eBay  yanked the item  thinking it was a fake  item or something  the bidding was up  into the $70,000 mark 
[02:44:00]  and then eBay yanked it  because they have a policy  of not putting joke items up  and then the woman  called and said  look this isn't a joke  I'm selling this thing  this is a cheese sandwich  she cooked up  a grilled cheese sandwich  ten years ago  she took one bite of it  and then was staring  the Virgin Mary  right in the face  on the sandwich  so she put it in a bag  and kept it  and in ten years  it's a miracle  it's a miracle  it hasn't even molded  the bread hasn't molded 
[02:44:30]  it hasn't gone bad  for ten years  so they're seeing that  as some kind of miracle  so she wants to sell it  it looks like Marlena Dietrich  can we get her on the phone?  Hillbilly Payday  yeah so now  they put it back up  and the bidding is over  $5,000 now already  I'm going to give Eric  a sex bagel a challenge  how great would it be  if a dog just got a hold of it  and ate it?  thanks sweetie  thanks  alright  thanks Dave  alright thank you  where's a picture of it?  oh I know  it doesn't even look like  the Virgin Mary  Anthony said it looked like 
[02:45:00]  Marlena Dietrich  oh that's right  yeah yeah yeah  looks more like her  than the Virgin Mary  it does  there was a time  when we were doing  radio in Boston  I don't want to get  the facts  I don't want to get  the facts wrong  but there was  a story very similar  remember was it  Jesus or the Virgin Mary  that was  that they were seen  in a pane of glass  Virgin Mary  was it a Virgin Mary?  yes  and we were doing radio  up there  and the line  to see this thing  you had to go upstairs  I think  if I remember 
[02:45:30]  and the line  was completely ridiculous  you know  hour wait  hours wait  I don't know  thousands of people  around this thing  what are you looking at?  I'm showing Jimmy  the picture  that is kind of a cool  it's cool  you know  you see her little hair  actually she looks  a little like  Miss Crabtree  from the old  Little Rascals  good  you know  it's not really a  I mean it's cool and all  but it's not a miracle  it's toast  that's 
[02:46:00]  you know  kind of a couple eyes  and nose  it's done very well  where it looks like art  it's shaded very nicely  it's not just like  you took a pencil  and drew two dots  for eyes  and nose and a mouth  but it looks like  an old  30's or 40's actress  you ever see the face  on Mars  that's what that looks like  the face on Mars  that's creepy  I've seen the face on Mars  that thing is a little creepy  I've tried to believe it  I've tried to get into it  I'm not believing anything  it's just kind of creepy 
[02:46:30]  that's one photo  they've shown various  other angles now  of the same mountain  of the face on Mars  and it doesn't look like anything  it's just that  taken from that angle  it shows a face  but there's no face  they didn't build a face on Mars  looks like a pharaoh  shut up  that's what it is  a pharaoh  so remember when we were  working in Boston  and we had something  kind of similar  Virgin Mary  in the glass of this apartment  yeah they made a big stink  but people were going there  to cure their children  and the line was hours  hours long  hours  they had thousands of people 
[02:47:00]  so we got one of our listeners  now  you know  I'm not really  I don't remember the facts  so if someone out there  could help us  but this guy  waited in line  the entire show  finally got up to the glass  and then attempted  to break it  live on our show  and then he literally  had a run for his life  yep  but did he get the job done  I don't remember  I really think that was  in Perth Amboy  because I kind of  remember that happening  wait did we do it down here  when we were at NAW  yes I'm almost positive  Perth Amboy, New Jersey  I think it was NAW  oh wow  I don't even have the right stage 
[02:47:30]  because I remember listening  and thinking these idiots  are going to get shot  I was on the show  but not in studio  I remember thinking  but did the guy end up  breaking the glass  I don't remember  no they would have killed him  somebody would have killed him  I remember the guy  was trying  he tried  but I don't think  he broke it  no he didn't  oh you were listening  and then he was chased  he was chased out  he was in the studio  I was in the studio  but I was on the show  I was coming in  wherever  I was just  boy we don't remember anything  it's like we all got  hit in the head with a boat  I know  we're horrible  that's why the listeners  are great  I'll get a million emails later 
[02:48:00]  no dick  this is exactly what happened  it was 9.22am  right here's the audio  if you need to  refresh your memories  and by the way  I'm selling that  as part of volume 32  to volume 50  on ebay  with a cheese sandwich  do you think he wants  a piece of cheese  he's taking the Virgin Mary  all for the cheese  Duke in New Jersey  what's up  scrape it off  what's up fellas  hey  morning  yeah there was  a few years back  in Jersey  like the Sake  or Patterson  there was an accident 
[02:48:30]  and a car had hit  a small tree  and it left  an impression  of what somebody  thought it was  the Virgin Mary  so people would  flock to it  all day long  oh gee  I feel me  you know what I mean  playing at it  bringing their children  for healing  so it was causing  such a chastity  that the town  sent a crew  and they took the tree  down in front of everybody  oh that's awesome  there you go  we live  we live  we live  that would be 
[02:49:00]  funny  sound effect  they just cut the tree  down in front of everybody  we live amongst  a bunch of dummies  in this country  a bunch of dummies  that will believe  a lot of stupid stuff  mumbo jumbo  hey man  easy with that type of talk  I like to call it  mumbo jumbo  I don't know  if you guys  ever knew this  but there is  a certain angle  and it's been documented  but if my mule  stands at a certain angle  it does cast  a Virgin Mary  shadow on my leg  so if any women  really  yeah 
[02:49:30]  nice  Virgin Mary  with AIDS  hey let's say  hi to Wyoming  it's Eric  oh Wyoming  we don't get many calls  from Wyoming  it is Whip Him Out  Wednesday  he has a wow story  go ahead Eric  hey guys  hey  yesterday  actually  for me  it was Whip It Out  Tuesday  on the back of the trailer  yesterday  I wrote  wow  O&A rocks  on XM  and I had this  SUV  come up alongside me  and these two girls  were sitting there  laughing and pointing at it  and one turned around 
[02:50:00]  and pulled her top up  nice  I'm telling you  this thing works  like a charm  we don't spend a lot of time  on this  but  you put the wow  on your car  and if the girls feel like it  they will flash you  we do have wow bumper stickers  you can get through  opianthony.com  it works  order them now  get them just in time  for the summer wow session  when they passed  Van O's  on the back of the SUV  it had New York played  and it had a  bumper sticker  on the back  for some New York radio station 
[02:50:30]  I probably knew  you guys were to begin with  alright  thank you buddy  let's go to Andy in Jersey  he remembers the Perth Amboy story  go ahead Andy  hoo hoo  you see what happened  as you've been in the radio  so long  you forgot your own bit  it definitely happened  in Perth Amboy New Jersey  I think you sent down  one of your interns  was online  got up there  and tried to break the window  and then was chased  by a crowd of surly believers  yeah was it  was it Psycho Mark  no  I think it might have been  no  I think it was just a listener  it was a listener 
[02:51:00]  we definitely attempted  to break the glass  in front of everyone  you guys have TV coverage  for that and everything  oh we did on that one  absolutely  alright cool  that's something you can't do  some nut will show up  with a pistol  if you do that  of course  why  religious freak  yeah  oh and they're not  because of what we did  at St. Pat's Cathedral  no  believe me  that's different  Master Poe's around  all the time  I know  we have bulletproof glass  in here  good luck getting past  him in that glass  but it's not the point  yeah right  you haven't read 
[02:51:30]  some of the emails  no no no  what I'm saying is  just to break the glass  it would just be  such a bad thing  I just got an email here  from some guy in Nigeria  and he wants me to  accept the 30 million dollars  for him  and then I get to keep  a percentage of it  as long as I  give him my bank account number  wow  this sounds like  a great deal  and I probably  shouldn't be telling you  because it says  keep it confidential  I am Abraham Abaka 
[02:52:00]  son of the late  Nigerian head of state  oh  died a few years ago  he came into  a lot of money  and this guy's afraid  the government  might take it  so he wants me  to take it  and  if I give him  my bank account number  he'll transfer the funds  into my account  and then I'll be able  when he gets here  safely with his family  I'll give him  like 20 million  and I get to keep  10 million of it  I'm in dude 
[02:52:30]  please don't get anyone else  to do this  because I want to do it  but why would he pick you  instead of just  someone he knows  let me see  I got your contacts  in the internet  in the internet  you probably meant  you know  on the internet  but you're a little typo  so  and I was moved  to write you  this letter  this was in confidence  considering my family  present  circumstantial  situations  see  a little typo 
[02:53:00]  maybe  who wrote you that  email  who wrote you that  sex bagel  ah there you go  the government  Nigeria  the funds  of my late father  deposited in a Swiss bank  and made me the next of kin  because my elder brother  died  before my late father  which makes me  the most eldest  of the entire family  my question is  I have 30 million US dollars  to save my family  from total bankruptcy  um 
[02:53:30]  in an iron ore company  he made his money  oh  because of the security watch  on me  I'm not able to carry out  this transaction  directly on my own  but Anthony  cool me a can  I can help this guy  and make a  a quick 10 mil  in the process  but if it's in a Swiss bank  why is he worried about it  who's believing this crap  I know  what  I know you're having fun with it  but  but everyone has gotten that  yeah  who's the dummy 
[02:54:00]  anyone buying this scam anymore  except these  stupid old people  I'm sick of  old people  are the easiest marks  they are truly  the gimpy leopard  on the plains  of the Serengeti  just waiting to get  their old throats  ripped out  and they fall for  everything  they really are lonely  idiots  everything  I went on a ride along  with Keith the cop  one day  one night  oh I remember this story  one night  I went on a ride along  I had to put on  the bulletproof vest  the whole deal  it was very cool  a lot of fun 
[02:54:30]  and Keith is just  a pisser to be around  yeah  so I'm cruising around  with him  we get a call  we get a call  like I'm on the job now  yeah we get a call  a woman  has had merchandise  stolen from her house  we go to the house  it's this  ancient woman  and man  sitting there  and  they say  some woman  ripped me off  came into my house  and stole my pocketbook  well okay  how did that happen  I let her in 
[02:55:00]  oh what happened  well she came to the door  with another woman  saying that she had just  spoke with my neighbor  who was very happy  with these blankets  that she is selling  and now the woman  and she said  the neighbor  told me that you  would be very interested  in these  now the old bag  feels like  if she tells the woman  no  that her little neighbor  is going to get angry  with her  because she personally  sent these women  over to her  it's a good scam  for the old 
[02:55:30]  so the woman  now one woman  takes the blanket  and shows the woman  this blanket  and goes  here  maybe there's  better light  over here  and kind of  pulls her away  from the other girl  that's accompanying  the crook  and while this woman  is now showing her  this blanket  the other woman  is rifling through  everything in the house  pocketbook  drawers  and they know  because they've done it  so many times  they know where to go  for these old people  they know where  they keep everything  ripped her off 
[02:56:00]  and she's  and there's an old woman  oh my stuff  she took me  and she's crying  to who  to who  me  I'm just along  for the ride along  because none of the  other cops  they've seen it  20,000 times  so for a minute  I put this look  of sensitivity  and caring  on my face  and it attracted  like a magnet  came over  what am I going  to do  I'm just like  oh that's  that's real tough  and Keith is laughing  Keith's just laughing  he's seen it  a thousand times  he doesn't care  that's sad though 
[02:56:30]  cops are superhuman  man  I gotta say  they see the worst crap  and they just  don't care  they're not really  bothered by it  they're not bothered  by it  in general  I applaud that  I mean the 9-11 thing  changed that  Mike from Staten Island  what's up  what's up guy  with that Nigerian  leather thing  that's going on  people have actually  disappeared  and have actually  been killed  over that  people have gone  to Nigeria  to either try  to get their money  back  or they go there  as part of the arrangement 
[02:57:00]  they don't want to  give these people  their bank account  so they're going to  personally meet him  and make sure it's okay  and they wind up  getting killed  kidnapped or whatever  yeah  how it works  is they fly there  and they tell them  when they get there  say listen  we have to pay off  the guy on the inside  so you have to  get the cash  I'm going to bring  the guy to the inside  and once you give me  the cash  then he'll release  the funds  and then we can do  all the wire transfers  that's how it works  that's why they need  your money  is to pay off  the guy that has  all the money  in hold 
[02:57:30]  at the bank  like he's the guy  because it's a scam  who believes this  old people  there was a guy  I read  just this Nigerian scheme  he was in his 70s  he had maybe  $750,000  as his life savings  life savings  now he has nothing  nothing left  because he kept  sending money  they tell you  please I need  another 5 grand  alright  15,000 more  and we'll get this done  unforeseen circumstances  I need another  10 grand  in order  and this old  stupid bastard 
[02:58:00]  is sending  sending  sending  if he had  three quarters  of a million dollars  he's just gotten  greedy  he's a dummy  greedy old bastard  you idiot  and now where is he  probably some  assisted living  he's got the  welfare money  coming in  and there he was  set up  an old lady  you know  not wanting to be rude  to a neighbor  they're lonely man  you know what  shut up  be smart  you don't let  strangers  in your house  I know  ever  but that's  different  than an anonymous  letter  someone could

[03:00:00]  song around  Chicago for  a few years  really  you want to  hear a little  bit of the  new one  and then we'll  play the  one we  let's hear  you know  something though  it's going to  be a very  hard act to  follow  tough sell  and these guys  what's it  called  they've been  emailing me  like crazy  like look  you think  that song  is good  you gotta  hear ours  what's it  what's it  called  the band's  called  greens  keepers  and the  song is  called  ball  cancer  and they're  a Chicago  band  this is their  lotion song  what's it  called  just lotion  I guess  kind of has 
[03:00:30]  like a new  wave feel  to it  cause  you're  looking down  the hole  you're  looking up  at me  you're cold  and tired  that is  easy to see  lower the rope  to you  a bucket  down the line  your membrane  will be soft  and smooth  and your heart  will be mine  it robs  the lotion  on its skin  what year  is it  1984

[03:01:30]  I like it  you like  what band does it sound like  though  it's driving me nuts  it's kind of like  Devo  but another band 
[03:02:00]  from the 80's  no it's a little more  melodic than a Devo  but it definitely  sounds like  someone from the 80's  it's a little more  it's a little more  it's a little more  it's a little more  it's a little more  it's a little more  yeah this isn't really  comedy driven  it's just kind of  about it  it's interesting  it's got a  80's  early 80's  song feel to it  now that I'm hearing  it on the air  it's not as bad  as we thought  before the show  well if you think  it's going to be  like funny  like the other one is  you're off

[03:12:30]  fraternity hazing  it's been in the  news off and on  the past I don't  know 10 years or  so  what happens to  you if you just  want to go to  college and not  be in a fraternity  is there a downside  to that because I  don't see an upside  of being in a  fraternity at all  it depends where you  go  I went to Geneseo  back in the day  it was all about  being in a fraternity  or sorority  back in the stay  I know you kind  of felt like you  didn't really belong  if you weren't part 
[03:13:00]  of a group back  then  really  yeah  oh yeah you had  all the fraternities  walking around campus  the sororities  it was a  like would  and then the  fraternities  would it really  bother anybody  if they had to  walk around not  being part of a  fraternity  there was plenty  of people that  didn't  like I don't  get the whole thing  but the parties  were unbelievable  you hook up with  a sorority  and you know  instant party  with girls that  like to drink  and get laid  if you weren't  in a fraternity  you weren't allowed  to go to the  sorority party  you would let  outsiders in a little 
[03:13:30]  bit here and there  alright so I still  I am not getting it  but you would feel  kind of out of place  yeah  yeah definitely  it was an instant  party  I mean if you're in  a dorm and you want  to get one of these  you know crazy  parties going  you know you got to  know a lot of people  you have to you know  if you're in a fraternity  there's a lot of guys  you hate even though  you're in the same  fraternity but  it's instant party  you got a hundred  guys and then you  got a sorority  with a hundred  girls right there  boom  so it's pretty much  just for the parties  yeah I would say so 
[03:14:00]  if people say  it's for more  I would laugh at you  I just don't understand  the whole fraternity  sorority thing  I got some good  friends out of the  fraternity I joined  but I  secret handshake  no nothing stupid  were you in  lambda lambda  lambda  the black fraternity  the tri-lams  the tri-lams  yes  it was all about  partying  you know I made  some good friends  out of it  I hated it  I hated being in  a fraternity  I try to be an 
[03:14:30]  individual  I try not to  follow the trends  of what's going on  but I don't know  I thought it was a  good idea at the  time and then I  tried to like leave  halfway through  pledging and I  got a little visit  from some brothers  and basically they  said in a very nice  way to stick it out  and I'm like why  and what if you  just said I don't  want to  they're like trust  me just stick it  out it's not good  if you quit in the  middle  and what happens  if you just said  no  they pretty much 
[03:15:00]  made it clear that  my life would be  miserable  so I got through  it and then I saw  the other guys that  did drop out and  they would get the  shit beat out of  them basically  so that you  drop out you were  beaten  and guys would get  yeah guys would  transfer and stuff  yeah they were  scared  I heard they  would put like a  blanket on you and  beat you with their  soap and then say  remember it's just a  bad dream fat boy  and you'd lay there  going ow ow ow ow  oh the other guy  would cover his ears  in that chilling  music playing 
[03:15:30]  then you'd pass out  because your  candidate lost the  election  while this guy  why is private  pile saying  african-american  we haven't even  gotten into this  and the phones are  just lit  Jake from  Plattsburgh  what's up  hey what's up  what's going on  um yeah I live  I'm still up here  in Plattsburgh  right now I live  about uh 10 feet  from the college  and uh when I  used to go there  they killed my  they killed my  friend one of the  frats  well uh by  accident obviously 
[03:16:00]  right  well yeah yeah  you can call it  an accident but  all this hazing  shit is bullshit  they uh they  fucking they  get they were  making them do  the water treatment  they just kept  having them drink  gallons and gallons  water  oh yeah water  poisoning  I read that  story  yeah and uh  that's what  happened he was  one of my best  friends there was  like six of us  and we were all  gonna pledge this  frat he was  pledging in the  first semester  and ever since  then like I  don't go to the  college anymore  I now go to a  different one  but uh  what's the water  thing that make  you drink  I don't understand 
[03:16:30]  what you just  drink water  you could drink  uh I didn't even  know this I  remember this story  you could drink  uh uh so much  water that you  could die  you'd die too  much water gets  in your system  it starts leaking  out of uh your  blood vessels into  your brain  what are there  any signs that  it's happening  you just keep  you have to drink  a ridiculous amount  of water  relax  should I finish  this or no  yeah of course  you can  I wouldn't worry  I don't even  know  maybe a doctor  could tell us  or whatever  but no it's  gotta be a  ridiculous amount  over a very  short period of  time also  yeah you just  gotta keep  forcing it in  yeah  so  really nasty 
[03:17:00]  wow  yeah I remember  that story  yeah it was  a lot of papers  right  okay  fat drunk  and killing  pledges  is no way  to go through  ah he stepped  on everything  damn it  I tried to get  in there  I'm doing an  animal house  thing and he's  fucking talking  glad your  friend's dead  oh yes  ruined my line  you had enough  good ones  very important  you had enough  good ones today  the show is very  important to me  you had enough  good lines today  you could have  freaking let this 
[03:17:30]  guy slide  Jesus  you didn't get  enough sleep  last night  oh my god  maybe the line  wasn't that  important  okay Jake  who's the mean  one on this  show  that's okay  guys  I was just  saying my  cars are  traveling  advertising  for you guys  not anymore  alright  I love you guys  alright cool  thank you Jake  and it was a  good line Anthony  wow  I thought he was  off the phone  by that plan  yeah he's still  there  PJ from the 
[03:18:00]  Bronx  how you doing  guys  first of all  our last kid  his friend died  if you're going  to be an  fraternity  you deserve  to die  it's disgusting  I just don't  get it  did you have  your little  sweatshirt  with the little  Greek letters  on it  did you  oh yeah I did  I didn't wear  mine often  though  often  which  you wore it  a few times  yeah  what did it  say on the  back of your  sweatshirt  halfway down  the back  did it have  an arrow  pointed to  your ass  and say  enter here  yeah there is 
[03:18:30]  some gayness  going on  oh my god  yeah I admit  that  it was a little  weird  you do  would you like  to admit it  while reading  Rent Boys  hell no  I was in  Genesea  my blonde hair  blowing in the  wind  hell no  not unlike  Ben's  when he's in  an airlocked  room  I think  I think  a lot of  the fraternities  you know  they had  their brothers  paddling  pledges  while they were  in their  underwear  just like  the scene  in Animal  House  I'm like  what is  this about  I just  want to 
[03:19:00]  drink a few  beers  from a keg  and bang  some broads  why am I  bending over  and getting  paddled  by you  this goes  with what  I was saying  earlier  a guy  if you go  to school  and you  don't want  to be  in a fraternity  that's fine  it seems  that the  fraternities  would draw  in guys  that want  to be  with other  guys  in these  living  situations  where perhaps  things can  happen  and there's  excuses for  nudity  and paddling  and it seems 
[03:19:30]  like a very  I have to  step in  no way  I mean  the pledging  yes  you're right  the pledging  was weird  man  I mean  we were  naked  see  that's all  I'm saying  then you become  a brother  and then it's  all about  just banging  chicks  and getting  you know  hammered  and it's  one big  party  like all  of a sudden  all that  goes away  as far as  the fraternity  I joined  but it was  weird man  but it was  there in the  first place  it had to  come from  somewhere  that's right  that ain't  going away  glad your  friend's dead  I know  how do we 
[03:20:00]  even continue  this break  after that  animal house  line  it's one of  my favorite  movies  bastard  dude we had  to do some  weird shit  you pledged  now what  what did you  have to do  well we got  paddled  paddled  see right  there  a man  paddling  another man's  ass  got paddled  what is the  was it  was it  on your  bare  behinds  come on  you remember  be honest 
[03:20:30]  oh I'm  oh like  it's cool  because I  had my  underwear  on  let me  tell you  something  there's  underwear  on paddling  which isn't  very much  cooler than  underwear  off  but off  is really  really bad  both are  really bad  I think it  was just  underwear  on  yeah  yeah  yeah  are you  sure you  don't want  to say  something  I'll tell  you one  story  you guys  I shouldn't  say you'll  laugh  but  because then  then I'm  expecting you  right  but I have 
[03:21:00]  enough confidence  in what I'm  about to tell  you  all right  there was  something  during hell  night  well  hmm  oh  it was kind  of like an  obstacle course  around the  house  oh a little  obstacle course  and uh  this is the  opening act  don't laugh  at this one  unless you  think it's  funny  uh  we were  blindfolded  with tampons  because that's  the cool thing  to do  how do you  blindfold with  tampons  one on each  eye maybe  no  big  big freaking  pads  oh a pad 
[03:21:30]  a kotex  pad  whatever  like I know  oh the tampons  are the ones  that slide in  with the string  oh all right  pads  they make good  they make good  blindfolds though  I guess  yeah thick  sure  and then uh  one stop  was the bathroom  and uh  the uh  the brothers  yelling and  screaming that  there was a  big fat  eggo pig  that took a  dump in  in the toilet  yeah  and everyone  was outraged  that this  big fat  eggo pig  from the  sorority  eggo  eggo 
[03:22:00]  one of the  sororities  took the  took a  dump  in the  in the  fraternity  bathroom  and we  had to  get rid  of that  we had to  get rid  of that  shit  as in  as in  take your  hands and  get a good  one  wait wait wait  you had to  pull  human feces  out of a  toilet bowl  because they  were pissed  at the  big fat  eggo pig  took a  crap in  our  toilet  now let  me tell  you  something  I'm  I'm  thinking  here  I don't  think it  was one  of those  girls  that took  a dump 
[03:22:30]  in that  toilet  um  we were  I think  it was  your  your  fraternity  brother's  crap  we were  told later  that it  was bananas  what was  the test  the water  was cold  look at  Jim  wow  where do  I join  oh you  were told  later it  was bananas  yeah  well do  your hair  and hands  smell like  bananas  or shit  I don't  remember  I was  smelling  bananas  but my  hands were  covered in  shit  I don't  remember  you don't  remember 
[03:23:00]  and then  one of the  grand finales  was that  we had  he's  looking off  into the  distance  in the  air  because  he doesn't  want to  make eye  contact  and  chuckling  thinking  back at  this stuff  because  this was  this was  pretty gay  we had a  play  yeah  was there a  porch involved  by the way  if I tell  the story  yeah  I get to  slide  from reading 
[03:23:30]  out of that  book  the first  time I  mess up  or I  don't tell  the story  I thought  you were  reading out  of the book  I know  I'm making  a deal  right now  with you  first time  you mess  up  yeah  okay  you get to  slide  yeah  because  this is  brutal  all right  all right  you can tell  by how  fair enough  fair enough  fair enough  sir  so we're  we're in our  underwear  doing the  obstacle course  around the  house  with the  grand finale  that waited  for us  in the  basement  which was  I can't  give that  away  because I'll  get killed 
[03:24:00]  so they say  oh wait  wait is it  with a secret  fraternity  you're not  allowed to  speak it  thing  well it's  the grand  finale  yeah  we had to  play  bomb  the DK  house  our rival  fraternity  bomb  the DK  house  which we  hated  of course  rumor has it  that this fine  fraternity did  some crazy  things themselves  well DK  was dick  kissers  so they  sound like  a wild  bunch  well one  of the  rumors  I can't  I don't  know for  sure  was that 
[03:24:30]  the pledgers  had to put  and this  isn't my  fraternity  put wax  lips on  and give  oral treats  to the  brothers  that's the  rumor that  was going  around  when I  went to  college  how do  you give  oral with  the wax  lips  on  I have  no idea  that's  gotta be  a rumor  that  could be  true  well some  kind of  maybe you  just rub  the lips  against the  side  of the  maybe you  grab a hold  of that  thing  you just  grab it  like it's  nobody's  business  and you rub  the wax  lips  bomb the  DK house 
[03:25:00]  I guess they  had a little  house set up  I don't know  because we were  blindfolded  a dollhouse  and we had  to pick up  the bombs  not using our  hands  oh no  oh my  goodness  what were the  bombs made  out of  the bombs  I believe  were marshmallows  with your  ass cheeks  holy shit  I can't even  look at you 
[03:25:30]  I cannot  even turn  my head  and look  at you  yeah  our marshmallows  allowed in the  barracks  and then we  now wait  in order to  pick it up  with ass  cheeks  you can't  have been  wearing underwear  nope  we  yeah  well  they were  still on  our body  technically  they were  kind of  around your  ankles  as you  scurried  around  squatting  sweaty  nervous  trying to  fit in  ass  cracked 
[03:26:00]  cheeks  opening up  picking up  what is  normally a  delicious  treat  and then you  had a  waddle over  to the  house  and drop  the marshmallow  right  as the  fraternity  brothers that  were in charge  this whole thing  went yeah  you dropped  that marshmallow  on that  house  drop it  yeah  yeah  yeah  wow  and then  was anything  done with  the marshmallows  who had to  clean up  the marshmallows  who had to  pick them up  I have no  idea  I really  don't have  to clean  up the  marshmallows  and then 
[03:26:30]  you know  then hell  night was  over and  then it  got back  to  that's the  weird part  then it  got back  to just  one big  party  and banging  broads  how many  sorties  did you  fly over  the target  dude it  was weird  man  there was  another  time  by the  one  forget the  rent boy  book  if anyone  screws up  they have to  read a  transcript of  that story  I know  that's the  new punishment  open Bombay  doors  Enola Gay  it's awful  there was another  time this was  when I was  this was when  I was rushing  yeah 
[03:27:00]  this is a  legendary story  and the girl  never pressed  charges so it's  okay she  actually partied  with us the  next day  pressed charges  and thought it  was actually  very cool  when I was  rushing the  fraternity  that's where  you go to  the fraternity  houses and  they try to  convince you  to pledge  their fraternity  yeah  and all the  brothers come  back from all  over the  country  you know  they get away  from their  wives  San Francisco  all the  country  look I  can't  fire island  I can't  even fight 
[03:27:30]  my way out  of that story  so I'll just  let you guys  be but  yeah  do you ever  put them  in your  ass cheeks  and then  warm them  over a nice  campfire  did you  or maybe  you could  squat over  my cocoa  marshmallow  in your  ass all  you need  a graham  crackers  and you  got  s'mores  yeah  already got  the delicious  chocolate  coating  dude  I  witnessed  when I  tried that  with hot  dogs  alright  alright  frozen  alright  relax  Jesus  watch it 
[03:28:00]  I'm carrying  a bunker  buster here  look I  share with  you guys  and this  is what  I get  this is  what I  get  I got  a banana  you want  to try  to pick  it up  yeah  it was  pretty weird  just awful  yeah  that is a  real bad  thing  was it  actually  hard  getting  the  marshmallow  off  the  guy's  cock  head  he's  buried  in his  pubes  you have  to go  all the  way down  grab it  and come  back up 
[03:28:30]  yeah  very funny  wow  gotta remember  though  I try to  get out  of all  this too  anyway  so when  I was  rushing  there was  a girl  they  bring  the  sorority  over  and we  were  having  a  huge  party  and this  girl  this girl  decided  that she  wanted  some  bukkake  I guess  great  I  said  I  don't  I  know  I 
[03:29:00]  know  I  need  those  marshmallows  Cindy  Oh, no, Dad.  There's a lima bean skin on the marshmallow.  Peter, come down with those marshmallows, Peter.  That is just an awful thing to have to go through. 
[03:29:30]  It really was.  Hey, Alice, did you go shopping this weekend?  Hope you picked up plenty of marshmallows and got the guys coming over.  We're going to bomb the card house we just built with marshmallows.  Yes, I hope you picked up some of those little hot cocoa marshmallows for Bobby's tight little ass.  I'm going home now. 
[03:30:00]  That's great.  Yeah, I had a waddle.  Someone's asking if I had a waddle.  Cindy!  You left the marshmallow stains on the teeter-totter, teeter-totter.  On the teeter-turner, you asshole.  I knew I went one too far.  What a dick.  You were feeling good about yourself.  I'm a Tina Turner.  How about Greg? 
[03:30:30]  That's not a marshmallow.  That's Oliver's nose.  Very good, okay.  Yeah.  Marshmallows.  You're bomb a house.  What's the big deal?  You pick it up, and then you have your waddle across the...  Can I ask you a question?  Your waddle.  It looks funny.  You're walking funny.  I understand.  Do you ever get a rod washing the end of Ghostbusters? 
[03:31:00]  This is coming from the Monster Rain guy.  Yes.  Who cares?  You're dropping marshmallows, dropping T-cells, whatever.  Marshmallow Rain.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, the other story's not as good.  Well, it is good, but no one's going to remember the other story when they're thinking about  this show later.  But this girl had no problem being trained by the whole fraternity. 
[03:31:30]  Not the whole fraternity.  Trained?  Yeah.  During rushing.  The old one guy goes, the next guy goes, the next guy.  A gangbang.  But only it's all not at the same time.  It's not in a single file.  I remember, like it was yesterday, there was a keg outside the room, and the brothers all  lined up with just their underwear on and took turns.  And there was a long line all the way down the hall.  Hey, how about that? 
[03:32:00]  I didn't partake, by the way.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  Why not?  Were there any condoms being used?  Were you on your stomach with a line at your door?  No.  Shut up, you ass.  No.  I mean, wow.  They pounded it so hard, it looked like it was whipped cream in your ass.  They churned that marshmallow into butter.  I'm turning your mic off. 
[03:32:30]  I have that power, you know.  You're done.  Just a slice of bread and you've got to fluff another.  You're done.  My mic's off.  I'm turning you off.  I can't take any more.  Jimmy's very entertaining today.  All right.  All right.  Well.  Now, there was so much splooge on her, it wasn't even funny.  I guess.  Because they weren't nice about it either.  No.  Someone sent in, hey, who was the president of your fraternity? 
[03:33:00]  Jim McGreevy?  That was fat-filled from New Jersey.  I'm a proud marshmallow-carrying American.  I admit during my term as governor, I carried marshmallows.  Wow. 
[03:33:30]  Well, you know something?  Bravo, Opie, for, you know, opening up, well.  Only one drop time.  Only one over the primary target.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that is, you know, to admit that is.  But it was many years ago.  Yeah.  He didn't know any better.  Of course not.  No.  Marshmallow bombing run on the little house.  Yeah, you can't really defend that one. 
[03:34:00]  No, that's not wrong with that.  I figured I'd share, though.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony!  What's up, fellas?  Hey, how are you, man?  Hey, Opie.  We share a common thread.  Yeah?  We both had Coach write us papers in Geneseo.  Oh, right on, man.  Almost got me kicked out of school.  Let me ask you a question.  How did you share a thread?  Did you put Rice Krispies on your dick and meet up with Opie and make Rice Krispies treats?  All right, all right, all right, all right.  You know what?  I was in a different fraternity. 
[03:34:30]  Our fraternities hung out.  We didn't do any of that kind of stuff.  But, uh...  What fraternity were you in?  Sigtas.  Well, Sigtas, yeah, those guys were, uh...  I played, I spent many a night at your fraternity playing Whale's Tales in the basement, Opie.  How cool were the parties, though?  Oh, the parties, the parties were...  I tell you what, pledging was the worst thing I've ever done over a span of five weeks.  Goes in a marshmallow, comes out a Malamar.  Once you're done, though, it's the best thing.  And then the parties are rocking.  The parties are rocking. 
[03:35:00]  It was just, uh...  It was...  I'm not gonna lie, it was, like, really strange.  It was bizarre that you go down that road just so you could...  The old dirt road.  Yeah, no shit.  It's...  Get on that highlight.  Opie's fraternity, at least when I was there a couple years after you, was certainly not  a drug-free fraternity.  Oh, man, we were...  They were smoking poles.  No, no, these guys were hardcore.  Those guys had connections to South America out of there.  No, there was, uh...  Wow.  There was major...  Drug fiends, huh?  ...major cocaine going through that fraternity. 
[03:35:30]  I had a friend that, uh...  Well, sure, they're also good at smuggling.  You're gonna attempt a kilo?  Yeah!  Yeah!  That's right, you squat over Columbia.  You come back up.  Pick up a plant, get on a plane.  But I got a good, uh...  Well, I got a bad story to tell you.  It's an unfunny story here.  I'll try to lower the expectations.  Very good.  We...  One thing that we had to go through was, you know, they blindfold you, throw... 
[03:36:00]  We had about 18 guys we pledged with.  They throw, like, three each in a car.  You know, blindfold you.  This is about, like, midnight, and it's, you know, below zero up there.  And they drop you off, like, 30 miles away from...  Oh, wait a minute.  I gotta jump in.  That was another thing we did.  They would get you really wasted, uh...  Making believe, you know, you were taking a break from pledging, and...  Oh, now you're one of the guys hanging out.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's what it was.  It's all about that.  It's like, you know, they...  They abuse you like crazy, and then also when you think there's more abuse, 
[03:36:30]  then they throw you a party.  Mm-hmm.  And sometimes they invite the sororities, but then sometimes these parties were set up.  And that...  And what they do is they get you really wasted, man, and, you know, you're smoking pot and  you're drinking.  Next thing you know, they, uh, completely attack you, tie you up, put a blindfold on you, and  throw you in cars.  Ooh.  And depending on how much they liked you or didn't like you, they would drop you off in  the middle of nowhere.  In Geneseo, man, it's all farms. 
[03:37:00]  All farms.  I mean, you can't figure it out.  And they would just drop you off in the middle of a field.  You're complete...  I'm telling you...  Were you naked or...  No, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  You're completely hammered.  To the point you can't really even, like, stand some of these guys.  Mm-hmm.  And they would drop you off with another guy or maybe two other guys, and then you had  to find your way home.  Only a marshmallow to eat for the whole way back.  Right.  No money, nothing.  And some of these guys would be dropped off in Canada.  Really?  Yeah, because this guy's saying 30 miles. 
[03:37:30]  Our fraternity...  No, there were some pledges that the brothers just hated, and they would drop them off over  the border in Canada.  Which, uh, do the math, I don't know, at least a couple hundred miles, right?  Oh, yeah, at least a hundred miles.  At least a hundred miles away.  Right, and then, you know, all night long, they're trying to get back to, you know, the  school.  Brother Flounder and Brother Pinto.  So, go ahead.  Long walk back.  Anthony, go ahead.  No, well, you know, and getting dropped off up there is not like getting dropped off on  Jericho Turnpike back on the island. 
[03:38:00]  That's right.  That's what I said.  I mean, it's all farms, so you're waiting for that one truck, hopefully, to be, you know,  driving down that old country road.  And they tell you, they tell you, you know, they gave us each, like, a six-pack and some  joints, and the deal is, you know, you're supposed to bond and use each other to find  your way back.  They're like, you're not supposed to ask any for any help.  It's about two in the morning, and I say, enough is enough.  I'm going, and I'm knocking on this door.  It was a big farm, but it was a house.  So, I go and knock on the door about two in the morning.  The dogs start barking.  The lights come on. 
[03:38:30]  The kids, you know, so the guy finally comes downstairs.  I apologize for waking him up and all, but I go, I just need directions back to Geneseo.  He looks at me and the two guys standing in the street, and he goes,  well, where's your car?  And I said, we're on foot.  He just shook his head.  He knew it was a fraternity thing and just said, boy, there's no way you're going to  make it back.  So, we made it back finally about seven in the morning, but I would say at least three  or four guys had to go to the infirmary with frostbite and things like that.  Nice.  There you go, frostbite. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Good stuff you can laugh about now.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  Opie, the grand finale.  Yeah.  What's it, the cum cookie?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  Come on.  Put it in the middle.  No, nothing like that.  The cum cookie.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Jim from Long Island, what's up? 
[03:39:30]  What's up?  Hey, what's up, Jim?  Went to school up in Potsdam, and I de-pledged.  It was the best thing I ever did.  Yeah.  Did you have to do any of this weird gay crap?  I started getting into it, and then that's when I left.  The semester I de-pledged, someone in the other school in town died.  And then later on, I went to move to the house with my friends.  We had better parties than the fraternities.  All right.  How did he die?  He had so many marshmallows in his ass, they began to leak into his brain. 
[03:40:00]  You're obsessed with his marshmallows, then.  And of sugar poisoning.  So anyway, this pledge tells a vicious beating, Anthony.  The victim of a twisted hazing ritual told a Queen's jury yesterday he urinated blood  and suffered seizures after three members of a St. John's frat pummeled him on the  buttocks with a two-pound paddle, once again with the paddle.  Paddling an ass.  The beatings were punishment for slip-ups during hardcore drill sessions in an off-campus  park, said, Brian, we had to recite history, poems, and if we were incorrect or we messed 
[03:40:30]  up, we'd get paddled.  If you bobbled your words when you spoke, if you recited a poem wrong, history wrong, or  answered a question wrong, you got hit.  Oh my God, you bobble your words?  Imagine if Colin's ass would look like chopped meat.  Colin Quinn?  Yeah.  The three face up to seven years in prison for the assaults, which allegedly took place  in June.  This fraternity has a policy that forbids hazing, Anthony.  It's still going on, though.  They have to tell the campus that, oh no, our fraternity doesn't do the hazing. 
[03:41:00]  And yeah, he was in the hospital for like three months with all sorts of kidney problems  and urinating blood and all that.  Yeah, if you're not doing something that's extremely gay, you're doing something that could  probably kill somebody or send them to the hospital.  He's getting paddled.  That's, that's, getting paddled is gayer than the, the marshmallow thing is really humiliating  and silly.  Gay.  Well, you could call it silly.  That's one word.  Dude.  Yeah.  Gay.  I wasn't naked naked.  You picked him up with your ass, Chase. 
[03:41:30]  It didn't mose his way into your underwear.  No, I had like this and then this.  That's awful.  And this.  Oh.  Well, because your mule wasn't showing.  No.  Would you have just slipped a little, the boyish stain with nervous sweat?  Your yam bag was bouncing off the marshmallow as you're just kind of bunny hopping.  With your socks and sneakers.  Marshmallow, marshmallow hanging.  Ugh.  Did you get caught up in hair?  Something?  Get a little sticky?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Would you do that, Ant? 
[03:42:00]  I would, I would so not even be within a hundred mile blast radius of whatever was going on  at a fraternity.  This was a different, there's no way I would do anything like that again.  It was a different time.  It was, I don't know.  What time was it?  It was, I don't know.  It was bizarre.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It was really weird.  All right.  Want a break?  All righty.  Okay. 
[03:42:30]  And then we'll finish the show.  Is Frank Caliendo calling in?  Oh, I see him there.  Cool.  We'll say hi to Frank Caliendo next.  It was whip him out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.

[03:43:30]  I'm not sure what phonics is, but I saw the girl that was hooked on it.  She's got a problem with it, apparently.  Have you seen that commercial?  Hooked on phonics!  Work for me!  She's adorable, you know.  I was thinking, wouldn't that be weird if she was applying when she learned and she  couldn't get the commercial straight, you know?  Hooked on phonics!

[03:45:00]  1944 when my front yard, my grandfather bought me a cowboy uniform.  And they told me, don't slip in a dog poo-poo.  And I did.  And I just kept slipping in it and falling.  And they just laughed.  It was beautiful.  And that was my first comedy routine.  And I've just been slipping in shit ever since.  Trying to get what else.

[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Where's all the old frat guys out there?  I'm the only one.  They're hanging out.  Holy.  There was a guy that was on the line.  He couldn't hold through the break that said that he had to be naked in a bathtub with other pledges.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We're hearing that a few people have gotten wowed today.  Thank you to the ladies that are helping us out with that.  Very good. 
[03:47:00]  Very good.  Very good.  On the line is one of our old friends.  We haven't talked to him in about two and a half years, I guess.  Meanwhile.  Meanwhile.  Frank Caliendo.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Frank.  How are you, buddy?  You know, I was thinking about that.  It's been a long time.  Yeah.  And I've realized, hey, I have three whole new impressions.  Three whole new impressions.  Wait.  Yeah.  Frank, I've got to tell you right off the bat, man.  I saw you doing Bush on MADtv.  Unbelievable.  It's really...  You know, and I'm going to tell you, it's really good. 
[03:47:30]  The only problem is, and you probably noticed this right away, that I look like Bush got stung by a bee and had allergic reaction.  Yeah, because they still put the makeup on you to try to make you look like Bush, and, you know, you have a different body type than the president.  You're very politically correct there, Opie.  It's like when Richard...  Hey, guys.  John Madden here, and that's the way to keep Frank on the air and not get rid of him.  You know, the body type's different. 
[03:48:00]  Oh.  Monday Night Football music.  Very good, Ben.  Yeah, you know, that's actually Fox music.  Those guys would think of it.  I'm on ABC now, so what the hell is going on here?  Yeah, man.  Way to go, guys.  I think someone screwed up.  Someone screwed up.  Oh, boy.  Who screwed up?  Now there are you.  Who was that?  They're yelling, Ben!  They're yelling, Ben!  Ben, is that you, Ben?  Did you screw the music up?  Because you know the penalty.  Actually, I did.  I did screw that up.  You know what the penalty is.  All right.  As much as I'd like to blame Steve.  The ship is run with discipline. 
[03:48:30]  All right.  There's a guy on line six.  He had to eat green olives out of an ass to join a fraternity.  Yeah.  What was he having, a martini, Steve?  All right.  So, yeah, Frank, your President Bush is unbelievable.  Yeah, you know, that's what America wants.  And that's, I had to eat black olives out of a guy's ass.  Oh, wow, that is good.  That's great, Ben.  Isn't that great?  Isn't that great, man?  What's with that, uh, that Narton fella? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I saw him, uh, and the secret cervix said, uh, hey, guy wants to throw AIDS at you.  I said, I don't even know what that means.  But I laughed my ass off.  Wow.  That really is good.  Yeah, that is a great voice.  That's right on.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Wow.  Yeah, they pick you up to do a lot more stuff on MADtv.  That's pretty cool. 
[03:49:30]  I remember when you first went on there, it was pretty much just the Madden bitch.  Yeah.  And then you'd be the guy in the background sometimes.  Sometimes that's how it still feels.  But, yeah, you know, it's just, there's like, I think there's 12 people on MADtv right now.  Yeah.  I'm actually, uh, I got off a bunch of episodes for the NFL on Fox stuff, where every week Terry Bradshaw thinks he's Simon Cowell.  And, uh, I'm on American Idol, and he's just like, not funny, Frank, not funny, after the show.  Really?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And after the show, he'll be like, very funny, Frank, very funny. 
[03:50:00]  Be like, well, why didn't you say that when I was on TV?  He'll be like, uh, well, how I hadn't explained it to me yet, man.  Well, I gotta tell you.  I'm hungry.  Let's go shoot some squirrels.  He seems like he'd be, and I know you probably can't say this, but to me, Bradshaw seems like he'd be a real cockblocker of anybody who's funny but him.  So that seems like it would be very par for the course, that stupid Pittsburgh idea of what's funny.  Just telling a good comedian that he sucks.  It's just, that's kind of the gig.  You know, Kimmel had this thing where, you know, there was a, you know, there was always a fight between the guys. 
[03:50:30]  And as you guys know, and, you know, my thing isn't really agitating people.  It's more as being just an idiot.  So, but, you know, Terry's come around, and I think he's really started liking the stuff more and more.  And it actually started out, when I started doing the NFL stuff, it was just terrible.  Because we were just doing totally the wrong kind of thing.  And then it eventually got to, like, this year we've had nine in a row that I think were pretty solid.  So it's gotten better.  And that's, it's just hard to do comedy on sports and do, you know, you can only go so far with stuff, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
[03:51:00]  Well, he was in Cannonball Run, I believe, wasn't he, in that movie?  Bradshaw.  Bradshaw.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  Great ballroom fight.  He's too cocky for a guy that should not be cocky.  He was a brilliant athlete, great quarterback, but he just bugs me on that show.  And I know, I'm sure you like him, but he bugs me watching him.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, everybody watches the show.  So I think there's a lot of people that do like him.  They love him.  Yeah, they do like him.  They do.  Hey, is Al Pacino around today? 
[03:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  What's going on?  What's up, Al?  What's happening?  You know, I miss you guys.  Yeah, we're on XM Satellite Radio now, you know.  Yeah, I know.  We can curse.  We can curse.  We're wearing this shirt a few months ago on television.  Yeah.  Well, fuck.  Television.  Somebody's been reading Whack Bag.  What's going on?  Very good.  That is.  They're all still there.  Yeah.  All five of them.  But the whole five.  All five of them. 
[03:52:00]  The Rob.  All five of the go-to.  Hey, I'm right here.  Robin Williams time.  Who knew?  What's going on?  I'm not sure.  Now it's time to add me into that list.  Hey, at least some of the guys you impersonate are still alive.  Yeah.  In the two years since we've been off the air, all my guys died.  Can't even do them anymore.  Dr. Smith dead.  Ronald Reagan dead.  Big pain in the ass, these people.  I know the feeling.  Had to pick up a Tony Danza. 
[03:52:30]  His Tony Danza's dream.  That's pretty much all you got to do.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  I'm going to come and visit you guys.  Yeah, when are you going to be around?  I haven't been in New York for...  Well, I probably haven't been in New York since you guys were on.  And so now there's a new reason to go there.  All right.  That's my only reason, by the way, to go to New York is just to see you guys.  By the way, we have this little thing we do.  We do the ozone midget sighting of the day.  And Steve pretty much ripped you off by doing your voice with the meanwhile back in the show. 
[03:53:00]  Meanwhile, somewhere in an unoriginal mind.  Yeah.  All right.  Leave us with some President Bush, and then we'll see you in studio soon, Frank.  Okay, guys.  Well, actually, maybe President Bush, plug in what you need to plug.  Maybe a website or one of your CDs.  You mean like FrankCaliendo.com?  Yeah, yeah.  You can also get there on MadTVGuy.com.  This guy has a bunch of websites that all whore out his products. 
[03:53:30]  He's hoping to get a link on OPAAnthony.com, one of those things.  That's how much of a jackass Calendino is.  He'll just start whoring himself out to O&A.  Hey, President Bush, why did you get rid of Colin Powell, by the way?  Guy's name's Colin.  Think about that.  I mean, Colin is a, that's a dumb name. 
[03:54:00]  You know?  I kept calling him Colin.  It pissed him off, and I said, Colin, that's a, might as well call you Anus Powell.  I know that wasn't as good of a joke as we'd hoped for, but still, the voice was strong in that one.  You know what I'm thinking?  That's funny.  That's Calendo.  When the actual joke doesn't work, he just rips on himself, the fat midget.  That's what Bradshaw called him the other day.  Now, the other thing is, Calendo has turned himself into the fact that what he can do now 
[03:54:30]  is, it's almost a ventriloquist act where the voice is the dummy, and he just makes fun of the bigger dummy.  Can't you guys cut me off and see it here?  Oh, we like when you guys get uncomfortable.  It's our favorite moment on the show.  Let us enjoy it.  Yeah.  Well, it's been there for about two minutes now.  All right, Frank.  We're going to, we'll link you to our websites, and when you get to New York, please stop by and say hi. 
[03:55:00]  All right, guys.  That sounds great.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  See you, man.  There's Frank Allen.  That Bush was funny, man.  That is a real good George Bush.  The breathing?  Yeah.  As he's getting his thoughts together.  Great.  Dan from Virginia.  I think it's Bradshaw and Cockblock, a funny guy.  That really irritates me.  Bradshaw's just a jock prick.  Exactly what he is.  He used to grab, like, the funny guy at school because the funny guy was getting the attention  and have to, like, beat on him.  I've watched Bradshaw.  I'm sorry.  There's nothing.  Yeah!  Remember that time, JB? 
[03:55:30]  He's not a funny guy.  And am I taking it from personal experience?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, me too.  As a matter of fact, it was Boomer Esiason in my school.  Really?  I was like the, you know, class clown kid in elementary school over in East Islip, New  York.  And he was the big jock.  He was the...  I believe it was Timber Point Elementary School.  Timber Point Elementary School.  And he was the jock.  He was the gym teacher's pride and joy, this guy.  Boomer Esiason.  And he hated being called Norman. 
[03:56:00]  Called Norman, he'd kick your ass.  And he would go around in the cafeteria and grab people's heads and, like, put the head  by his ass and fart.  And then, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, walk away.  I don't mind that so much.  No?  Yeah.  Would he ever pick up a marshmallow?  All right.  Come on.  Yeah, that whole...  I don't mind a jock, but just...  When they try to be funny...  Here's a guy like Bradshaw.  In high school, they got laughs because there's these douchebag bully types of people would  laugh so they didn't get punched in the face. 
[03:56:30]  Right.  And they actually think they're funny guys.  And I've watched him and JB.  I like Howie Long.  But stop trying to be funny.  Stop laughing at your own shit.  Nobody laughs.  Mm-hmm.  Caliendo's probably the only funny thing on that show.  And, of course, Bradshaw gets annoyed.  And he's got to trash the comic.  God, that makes me physically ill.  Well, Anthony's got to finish his story.  Sorry.  JB!  JB!  JB!  Oh, with the Norman?  Well, I was just talking about what a prick he was.  But, yeah.  You call him Norman, he'd kick your ass.  So, Anthony decided to call him Norman.  Call him Norman. 
[03:57:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  And Boomer called him out on it.  I call you out.  You get a fight in front of the school.  What did you say?  Hey, Norman?  Yeah.  It was like, Norman!  And then run away.  And then someone ratted me out.  One of his other jock friends?  Yeah.  One of his other jock friends, I guess.  And then, you know, you had one of those outside the school fights at 3 o'clock where everyone  gathers around.  And I'm a little...  I was a stick figure of a child.  And he was the big jock guy.  You fought him?  I had him.  He beat you up?  I don't do.  I kept my...  You know how in school fights, the first thing you do is rip your jacket off, throw it down, 
[03:57:30]  and go, come on.  I had this big heavy jacket on, and I just kept it on.  Zipped it all the way up for some extra padding.  It was like a big parka.  Nice puffy...  Big puffy thing.  ...witter coat.  Because I knew I wasn't going to be depending on any of my lightning quick moves to take him  out, you know?  What'd you do?  This is the best part.  I lunged forward and punched, hit him square on the forehead with my right hand, and spent 
[03:58:00]  the next eight weeks in a cast because I broke my arm.  Your whole arm?  Yeah.  Ulna and Radius, both bones in the forearm, snapped, hitting him in the head.  You had some adrenaline.  You're thinking, I have only one shot at this.  Did he punch you in the face back, or did your screams end the fight?  I think it was just laughing and, you know, me on the ground.  Oh, my God.  It's pretty much over.  I kicked my own ass on his head.  Did he say, you and me are going to fight at three o'clock?  At three o'clock.  And there's nothing you can do about it. 
[03:58:30]  That was it.  That's a fun movie.  So you guys, you know, I can help get myself out of the barrel, but you're delaying.  There's a guy that, that marshmallow story is going to go on and on.  Grizzly from New York, real fast.  Grizzly.  Oh, what's happening, guys?  Yeah, the fraternity at Pace that we pledged, Deke, they were the worst, man.  They made us stick green olives up our asses and then wanted us to eat them.  And we walked.  We didn't do it.  It sucked.  And we were like, no way.  Oh, crap.  I thought you ate the olive.  Oh, I thought he did eat the olive. 
[03:59:00]  Dan from Virginia.  No, he had sense enough to say no.  He said, no, thank you.  That's too gay.  All right.  Go ahead, real fast.  We had to take three people for our hell week into the bathroom, and we all basically  took shits when we had to go to the bathroom.  We had to take a couple people with us.  Wait, what?  We had to take a couple people with us every time we had to go to the bathroom.  They'd keep us in this one room.  And when we had to go to the bathroom, we had to take two other people with us.  And?  In the same bathroom.  So we'd basically just take shits and piss with two other people in this midget bathroom.  All right, listen.  I'm going to cut this off. 
[03:59:30]  Tomorrow, you got it.  This is your homework assignment.  Oh, homework on the show today.  I'm not the only one.  I'm not the only one.  I want to hear some more of these hazing stories where it got a little weird.  Where you're not the only one.  Got a little weird.  There's a lot of people that did this.  A couple marshmallows.  I didn't take a dick, okay?  It was a little weird.  I'll admit that.  Jimmy, we were just talking about how we're going to, you know, put a couple of marshmallows  on our ass and scurry over and drop them somewhere.  Yeah, drop them in the new office, which looks good, by the way.  Getting there, getting there.  Looks like it's going to be done by Friday.  Cringebox.  I learned that butt plug is O&A's yesterday. 
[04:00:00]  Jake from Atlanta.  I learned today a perfect circle has the third greatest rock song of all time.  According to Rolling Stone, Jimmy doesn't support terrorism by buying Starbucks.  Steve C. is working on his diction.  Mike from Jersey.  Today I learned that JFK looked really bad after his time as president.  He also learned that Yoko needs to die.  Mike from Freehold.  I pledge fraternity at Seton Hall U right in the middle of Newark.  While pledging, they dropped me off in the middle of Newark by myself and screamed out  that this white boy hates the N-word.  I had to run all the way back to campus, scared shitless. 
[04:00:30]  Lon Gelman from Glen Oaks, Queens says, I learned Anth calls me Lon Smellman.  Huddle, huddle.  All right.  Toolbag.  I learned that O.P. gets a rod whenever he sees the end of Ghostbusters.  Chris from Boston.  I learned Jim would take a boat to the head for an 8-1 Cowboys record.  Did you learn that Ben has to read tomorrow?  Oh, you're not going to forget, right?  No.  We'll start the show off with a Ben reading.  What an error that was.  Remember what his error was, okay?  I'm actually finding a Ben one for him to read.  All right.  Rocky from Long Island.  Go ahead. 
[04:01:00]  Hey, guys.  I learned it's not a miracle.  It's just toast.  Thank you.  And Mike from Philly.  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Squeeze us in at the end of the show.  My fraternity with sick pie, they used to make us get naked on the floor in the basement  and call breakfast in bed.  They put flour, syrup, eggs, and everything all over us, and they put Tabasco all over  our balls.  There you go.  Tabasco all over his balls.  Breakfast in bed, they call it.  This guy's brave enough to admit that he got a little weird when he pledged.  Thank you so much for helping me out a little bit. 
[04:01:30]  John from New York.  What's going on?  Not much, man.  I learned that Jimmy's got to stop shouting into the fucking microphone.  He's throwing all my levels out.  I'm sorry, sir.  I did try to warn you, man.  I didn't shout today.  No, it's cool if you shout, but you've got to go back just slightly.  Because you're distorting and just messing up the sound out there.  Shout.  Shout.  Drop that marshmallow out.  You know, you share, and look what happens.  Right. 
[04:02:00]  Cocks are the things I will dream about.  All right, now you're going for the stretch.  How's it going?  Oh, four seconds.  Oh, my God.  I've got to tell you something, dude.  Oh, that, uh...  Worst acting job.  Program complete.  X-S-O.  Confidential.  Smart radio.  Restricted for your ears only.  The Emmylou Harris Artist Confidential Encores are airing all this week.  We had this door that I had to keep cracked for the cats. 
[04:02:30]  It kept swinging open, and I grabbed a Grammy, and I used it as a doorstop.  Can we coax another tune out of you here?  This is another song off of Red Dirt Girl.  Last night I dreamed about you.  Hear encore appearances all this week.  Monday, November 15th, 6P in the East.  Wednesday, November 17th, 9A in the East.  Friday, November 19th, 2P in the East.

I don't understand anything, so there you go.  You know my problem?  I watch too much news, man.  That's my problem.  That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in  one day. 
[04:03:30]  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour.  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless.  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man.  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him. 
[04:04:00]  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of AIDS.  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid.  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports. 
[04:04:30]  This is the nicest part of the South, for sure, man.  It's like the only part of the South you go, like, when I go there, nobody goes, man, I wish you could take me back to New York with you.  You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers behind in your car and shit.  Shit, bro. 
[04:05:00]  It's nice here.  It's too hot, bro.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July and shit.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day.  90 degrees and shit.  It's, like, hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Radio to the power of X.  For money and shit. 
[04:05:30]  Are you alone?  Yes.  Thank you.
