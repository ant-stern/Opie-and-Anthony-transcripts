<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a furious tirade against a rival radio show, Rocco and Matty, accusing them of blatantly stealing their bits.  Specifically, they highlighted the alleged theft of the "Sex for Sam" contest (rebranded as "Sex Across New England") and the "F.U. Line" (copied as "Blow Me Line"), using extremely vulgar and offensive language to describe Rocco.  They also mentioned the theft of a "Fetish Friday" segment and urged listeners to harass Rocco and his show.

The show then transitioned to a "Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears Tickets?" contest, featuring an interview with a 19-year-old mother, Erin, who became pregnant at 14. This interview sparked further crude and sexually charged commentary from the hosts. The conversation segued into a debate about human cloning, its scientific possibilities, and religious objections.  Several callers expressed support for the hosts' anger towards Rocco.

The discussion on cloning continued, fueled by a caller's question about Eve being a clone of Adam.  The hosts and callers debated the theological and scientific implications, including the nature of souls and interpretations of the Bible.  A caller, Malachi, opposed cloning based on religious grounds.  The conversation then shifted to stem cell research and its ethical considerations, quickly devolving into graphic and sexually explicit humor, including hypothetical scenarios involving a clone.

This vulgar humor continued with a comedic song by Stephen Lynch about a priest's sexual exploits with an altar boy. The hosts then discussed Chyna (Joanie Laurer) from the WWF, leading to a caller's question about cloning Asian children for labor, and a discussion about Vince McMahon's sexually suggestive behavior on WWE Raw.  Listener calls followed, including one about a mother walking around naked.  The conversation returned to Chyna's departure from WWF and her Playboy photos, with graphic descriptions of her physique.  The segment concluded with promotional material and listener calls.

A phone interview with Joanie Laurer (Chyna) followed.  She discussed her departure from the WWF, her relationship with Triple H, and her Playboy photoshoot and "Exotic Erotic Ball."  Laurer revealed that her boyfriend's affair with Stephanie McMahon influenced her decision to leave the WWF.  She also discussed her strength, denied steroid use, and promoted her projects.  Humorous exchanges occurred between the hosts and Laurer, particularly about her strength and the WWF infidelity. The hosts expressed apprehension about having Laurer in the studio.  The segment also featured listener calls, including one about a man who injured himself laughing at Jim Norton's jokes, and "Stalker Patty," who discussed her hammertoes.  Chris Barron (Spin Doctors) made a brief in-studio appearance.

The show concluded with numerous listener calls sharing what they "learned" that day, often crudely and humorously. These included observations about physical appearances, sexual innuendo, and personal anecdotes.  One caller, Kerry, expressed discomfort with the show's perceived "gayness," prompting a sarcastic response from the hosts.  The rivalry with a Boston radio station ("Rockhole") was re-addressed, with listeners encouraged to harass them.  Several callers shared humorous "learned" statements.  Janine from Buffalo expressed interest in a Britney Spears contest. The show ended with a callerâ€™s crude equation, closing remarks, and references to "Whip Him Out Wednesday." Chris Barron made another brief appearance.

Hello, hello.  How is everyone today?  Uh, I don't give a F.  There's something to say, I guess.  It's been better. 
[00:00:30]  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Anthony, under the weather.  I was fine yesterday, right?  And then, uh, I sneezed a couple of times.  It's all over, Jack.  That got me a cold.  Or the thorax.  I'm not sure. 
[00:01:00]  I'll tell you.  I learned about the thorax on the way in today, Anthony.  You did?  Yes.  Uh, anthrax.  Kind of like the flu.  You get the same type of symptoms.  Uh-oh.  Key difference, though.  Do you have a runny nose?  Yeah, snotting all over the place.  You're fine.  But no snot with anthrax?  No snot with anthrax.  Because I'll tell you something.  Uh, you know, I've gotten colds in my day.  And I don't think about them.  You just get it.  And you go, oh, crap.  I got a cold.  Down the NyQuil and whatever you're going to do. 
[00:01:30]  But now, the second you get a cold, I'm like, oh, my throat.  Do I have a fever?  Do I?  Oh, I got the anthrax.  I got the goddamn anthrax.  They got me.  That friggin' Osama bin Laden got me.  You know?  But, yeah, the snot factor is definitely in play.  See?  Yeah.  Okay.  Mmm.  You ready to rant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you ready?  Uh, are we referring to what was on my desk? 
[00:02:00]  Hold on.  Let me just read it, okay?  Yeah, this is, uh, what I read.  First thing coming in.  This is brilliant.  Uh, I'll just read.  Word for word.  Need to spice up your relationship?  In 25 words or less, email us why you and your partner should be one of five couples we choose to take part in our Sex Across blank.  Oh, you're not saying where this is?  Not yet.  Okay.  To take part in our Sex Across foot state here. 
[00:02:30]  Contest for a chance to win an island getaway.  Uh-huh.  What's Sex Across blank?  Well, it's a race.  You and your partner will have to visit five or ten blank towns of our choice.  Each couple will have a different itinerary.  And have sex in each town.  Oh.  The couple that completes the race first wins.  Oh, and by the way, sex is defined by the Clintonian standard, oral doesn't count.  So it's...  Email us today.  I don't remember talking about doing Sex for Sam 3. 
[00:03:00]  Do you, Anthony?  No.  Uh, we did Sex for Sam.  We did Sex for Sam 2.  And, um...  We were definitely, uh, going to be doing a Sex for Sam 3, but this isn't our Sex for Sam.  Are you sure, uh, Rick?  Well, it's...  Hey, are you guys, uh, you know, plotting against us or something?  It is.  It is called the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We usually know everything that's going on around here.  It's exactly the same as Sex for Sam. 
[00:03:30]  But it's not Sex for Sam.  They're calling it Sex Across New England.  Oh.  Gee.  Gee, I wonder who this could be.  Sex Across New England.  Do you have any shame?  There is no shame there.  Do you have any shame whatsoever?  Everyone knows that the Sex for Sam thing is a very original bit.  No one has done it before, so I don't want to hear from any of you twats today. 
[00:04:00]  You brainless, uncreative, talentless, fat jack-off.  This is the second bit in a week that he's just flat-out taking from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  So, what he's doing is...  You know how we do the F.U. line, Anthony?  Yeah.  Another very original idea that I don't remember anyone else doing before us.  Well, we've always given people the idea to vent.  The idea to vent and be, uh, very interactive with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  So, we have what's called the F.U. line.  Right.  You can get to the F.U. line through O.P. and Anthony.com and all of our websites, the phone number and all that.  You leave a little message and we go to, uh, go to the F.U. line a few times every day, right?  Yeah.  Well, uh, Rock Hole and his, uh, little gay buddy there.  I don't know if he's gay, but he just seems gay.  Who, Matty?  Uh, they, they have come up with the Blow Me line.  Yeah.  Which is the exact same thing.  As the F.U. line.  Just kind of to change the name a little bit.  So, well, they took that and now this week they're, uh, they're going to attempt to do, uh, basically our Sex for Sam contest. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  What a son of a bitch.  That is just, you know, troll the website.  Troll Foundry Music dot com.  That's the biggest mistake you and I did.  I know.  Was, uh, putting a website together for the radio show.  Something we have been doing for close to eight years now, by the way.  It gives this bloated, jerk-off, uh, uh, unlimited, unlimited amount of, uh, material for his show. 
[00:05:30]  Not only him, a bunch of other guys.  Yeah.  You know how many people are doing Moms I'd Like to F?  I know.  That contest?  Like, you know something?  It's just even, even worse.  You know how many people are doing Stoner Spelling Bee now because of us?  When this ass monkey does it.  He's going to do, hey, hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Oh, now we're just going to get people to piss us off even more. 
[00:06:00]  Whatever.  This has to be said, though, man.  Yeah.  There, I'll, I'll, I'll try to address this sea sucker on, uh, line nine over here.  The difference is, my friend.  It's not saying, uh, you're ripping me off.  It's not saying that just by talking on the radio, buffoon, ass monkey, F-head, jerk, dick, see.  It's not saying that just by talking on the radio that they're ripping us off. 
[00:06:30]  Like other people do.  John on line nine, you jerk off.  It has to do with us doing Sex for Sam, having pictures, having audio on the website, it being very successful and a hell of a lot of fun.  One of our hugest bits ever.  It was written up in the trades as being an original idea.  And, uh, pictures have gone all over the place.  People have talked about it.  And then a fat, talentless ass taking the exact same thing and doing it in a city we are newly broadcasting to. 
[00:07:00]  John.  It's not getting on and going, oh, they're talking, they're breathing, they're walking.  That's me.  John.  Jerk.  Ass.  It has to do with Rock Hole doing Sex for Sam.  It's the exact bit.  It's the exact same thing we do. 
[00:07:30]  There's the difference.  It's obvious they have decided the only way to compete against us now that we're back on in Boston is to, uh, take our best bits and just, uh, throw them on their airwaves.  Simple as that.  Stinky, pick up line nine, call them the C word, and just hang up.  There we go.  Thank you.  He did just what you wanted.  That's it.  So, go ahead.  Continue.  So, uh, yeah, it's, it's the exact same thing.  You're taking people, uh, like we did, gather them up, uh, in couples, send them off to different locations around whatever city you're broadcasting from. 
[00:08:00]  Here it was New York.  And, uh, have them have sex.  For, uh, points.  And there's a winner.  And we've done this already.  Twice.  Twice.  And we were definitely planning and talking about doing it in Boston.  And this fat load, talentless ass who can't even, can't even get on the air and do anything anyone wants to hear, uh, then decides he's gonna do sex for Sam. 
[00:08:30]  It's sex for Sam.  It's what it is.  I'm sorry.  Well, I just, I just hope the listeners realize what's going on.  You better, you mother effers.  I don't want this guy getting a moment's sleep.  I don't want one friggin' second to go by that he's not being harassed on the air about this. 
[00:09:00]  He's a phony.  They also took our assault on the media.  Oh, please.  Jump up and down in front of live TV crews and stuff.  Whatever.  This is so blatant.  Our, our website is basically a playbook for, uh, for WAF, our old radio station.  Listen to me.  Every single thing he's done on the air is a fake set-up thing.  There's nothing going on there that's, uh, authentic.  It's, it's ridiculous. 
[00:09:30]  Let me pick my sidekick.  If you have a seat number at Fenway that corresponds with the one we fly over, are you people listening?  Fake.  The guy worked in radio.  That's how he picked them.  Hey, I'm getting married.  Hey, Dave, I'm getting married on the air.  Oh, look, I storm away from the altar right at the, uh, last minute.  Fake.  Who's, who's buying this crap?  Are people calling up? 
[00:10:00]  Hey, Rocco, that was really good.  You, you ran away from your work.  I'm only 10, but I wouldn't get married either.  Hey, thanks, little buddy.  Like, who's believing that?  We are prep burger for Rocco's radio show.  Prep burger.  And now this, I come in, it's, uh, someone had to put it right on my computer keyboard so I wouldn't see anything else first.  And I see sex for Sam done by that fat, load, jackass, mother, oh, God, I can't even curse. 
[00:10:30]  Mother f***er.  Bundy, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Uh, you know, you're not the only ones that he steals from.  They've got, they've got Birdsey down the dial.  Right.  And, I don't know, I'm going to see you at Birdsey. 
[00:11:00]  Hold on, you ass!  Let's have a conversation.  Do you listen when you talk?  Ah!  I just want to fill everyone in, Bundy.  Birdsey is Rocco's old partner that he never stood up for when they decide to let him go.  All right.  Right.  And now he's on another station in Boston.  Bundy, now continue.  I'm sorry that I lost it on you.  I'm sorry.  Because you seem to be a...  For about a year now, Birdsey's done Fetish Friday.  Right.  So, a few weeks ago, Schlocko says, I've had a brainstorm. 
[00:11:30]  He doesn't even change the name.  He says, from now on, we're going to do a new thing called Fetish Friday.  There you go.  He doesn't even change the name.  He doesn't care.  It's, it's...  Well, I just hope you guys understand and realize what's going on.  Because it drives us effing nuts.  Because he's a lazy, fat load who has many, many problems that we will exploit on this show eventually.  Who lives in the middle of freaking Worcester, who's praying someday he could get out of that town and maybe do radio in a bigger town. 
[00:12:00]  Or maybe get syndicated like Anthony and I.  He's just a cheap imitation of Bubba the Love Sponge who's out of Florida.  And Bubba the Love Sponge isn't even that good.  And Rocco's trying to do his whole act really, really badly.  Oh, don't worry, Rocco.  Rocco, you still have to...  Do it.  You still have to drive home at night and be with yourself in your stupid, tiny little apartment.  And you know you're pathetic and you have nothing to offer in this business. 
[00:12:30]  So have fun doing all our bits in the middle of Worcester.  Do it.  Do this Sex for Sam that you're doing.  Because that's what it is.  I'm not even calling it whatever you call it.  It's Sex for Sam.  Go ahead and do it.  We will undermine this thing so bad it's going to suck on the air.  I'll warn you.  I'll warn you right now.  You will not do this.  We have lunatics there that will totally disrupt your stupid copy imitation of the bit that we do. 
[00:13:00]  That we've done twice already.  And keep wondering why you're going nowhere in this business, you pathetic fat load.  There you go.  Go ahead.  Do it up.  Boy, how many cities are you going to be syndicated to in the near future, Rocco?  Oh, none.  That's right.  Better hope you still got a job, Rocco.  Never mind syndicated.  With the likes of Dave Dickless at the helm.  Hey, that's a great idea, Rocco.  Yeah, I figured I'd run it past you, Dave, because you told me to run everything past you. 
[00:13:30]  You're like the third member of the Rocco and Maddie show.  So, go ahead.  Do it, Rocco.  Do it.  It ain't going to work.  Still got to pull off the bit.  Yeah.  You can take it.  Still got to make it work.  Hey, Dave, I got an idea.  Douche or dressing.  I'm going to be doing douche or dressing.  You son of a bitch. 
[00:14:00]  Debbie, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I just wanted to know, why do you guys hold back so much?  Could you tell us how you really feel about this?  He's a twat.  I swear to God.  It's so frustrating, because, you know what?  Anthony and I are at fault, because we have this website, FoundryMusic.com, that's beyond huge for the listeners.  I know, and I look at it all the time.  They really enjoy it.  And know what happens?  Rocco goes on there and gets all his ideas for the goddamn show. 
[00:14:30]  He uses it as a show prep.  He doesn't even have to work.  All he has to do is go, well, what did Opie and Anthony do?  Well, I could do this.  I'll just change the name of it.  Well, why should he work?  Instead of having the F.U. line, I'll just call it the blow-me line.  Yeah, you guys doing it all for him.  See, Dave, it's different.  Well, we're not really calling ours Sex for Sam, so it's different, right?  Wrong!  If anyone is buying this show up there, if you're sitting there listening and really thinking,  this is great, I don't even know.  You've got problems. 
[00:15:00]  It's an embarrassment, and I freaking had it.  Instead of whip him out Wednesday, well, we'll do whip ass Wednesday.  Whip ass Wednesday.  It's still, yeah, it's whip Wednesday.  Well, if I do whip ass Wednesday, hopefully people will finally forget about Opie and Anthony  and that great wow promotion they started when they were here.  Hey, guys, I'll tell you what, anybody who's been listening to you for any amount of time  is going to stick right by you.  Oh, I hope so.  And we all know.  I hope so.  I hope because you never know where it comes from.  You never know because I'll tell you what happens. 
[00:15:30]  All of a sudden, he'll do our exact bit, and then it'll be all over the papers.  Yeah, it'll be like, oh, wow, you know, people arrested or something happened.  Rocco with this sex idea, and you've got to sit there and look at that, you know, just  knowing he just grabbed it from you.  Rocco, stick to something you know a lot about, and that's whipping guys' asses.  Yeah.  Hey, guys are going to come up, and we're going to have his ass whipped. 
[00:16:00]  That's hot.  That's hot, Dave.  Who in the hell in their right mind would sit in a studio and come up with an idea called  Whip Ass Wednesday and think it's a great idea to sit there and watch guys get spanked  live on the air?  Whip Ass Wednesday.  Yeah, well.  That's not faggy.  That is such faggy stuff.  What was that, GM's idea, Rock Hole?  You know, maybe if there were a couple women.  Here's a little test to the listeners in Boston.  Sex for Sam or Sex Across New England. 
[00:16:30]  Hmm, good idea, right?  Yes.  That's an Opie and Anthony idea.  Very good.  Ass Whip Wednesday.  And not an Opie and Anthony idea.  A faggy idea by a fat, bloated piece of crap that is stuck in Worcester wishing, wishing,  wishing that he could go on to bigger and better things.  Yeah, it'll never happen.  Because, Rocko, you have to go home and sleep and be with yourself and you know you're just  a pathetic loser that hasn't come up with an original idea on radio since you've been  in it.  Well, I'll tell you what, guys.  In a fat, sweaty bed. 
[00:17:00]  You have to stop being so shy and withdrawn.  Yeah.  All right, you're a twat.  I can't find a girlfriend.  I don't understand why.  I'll make, like, a lot of chicks are coming on to me and then I'll pick one to marry.  Then I'll walk away from the...  Oh, thank you to whoever that was that sent us that horrendous piece of video of his marriage  segment.  Right.  Where he actually has girls calling up saying they want to go out with him and some of these  girls are really hot. 
[00:17:30]  Just stop it.  Would you just stop already?  Another phony gang bit.  Who wants to lift up that big tub of fat blubber over your junk and latch on to that?  Except your little kiss-ass partner.  How much does he just suck it, Rock Hole?  How much does he lift that big bunt of fat up and just suck that cheesy junk down there?  Oh, thank you for this opportunity, Rock Hole.  And another taste of reality for Rocko. 
[00:18:00]  His claim to fame is that he discovered Godsmack.  Rocko, wake the F up.  Godsmack was going to make it no matter what you or anyone else did, you tool.  So get off your freaking high horse about that as well.  Nick from Rochester.  No, it's not over.  Move on.  Thank you very much, you see.  It's not.  Don't you understand, you stupid piece of crap?  Ugh. 
[00:18:30]  See, this is why.  You know something?  Maybe he is right.  Just move on.  Because there's no way.  I read some of this instant feedback.  I look at phone calls.  And I just got to assume that people in Boston are just as stupid as people like this.  They'll tune in.  They'll love this Rock Hole stuff that he got from this show.  But they've got to be morons.  They've been buying that crap since we've been gone.  You know why it's frustrating?  Oh, please.  Let me say something.  We do a talk show four hours a day, okay?  Do you guys honestly think out there that this is easy to do?  It is not easy to do. 
[00:19:00]  A lot of people think we have the lives.  It's very stressful.  You've got to come up with brand new ideas all the time.  We work our asses off.  Everyone in this room, I know we make fun of each other and stuff, but we work really hard on coming up with some original new radio.  We try really hard.  So when we come up with really good ideas like Sex for Sam, sure, we come up with ideas that blow and you guys are turning off the radio and you're going somewhere else.  We understand that's part of the game.  But when we come up with ideas that we just know that kill, like the homeless shopping spree and Sex for Sam and the teen voyeur bus, things that are very original that has never been done in radio before. 
[00:19:30]  So shut up, you effing tools.  And then someone, doesn't even have to work, just wakes up and rolls out of bed at one, he has a show at three, and just looks on our website, finds out all the great ideas we're coming up with, and just casually throws it on a show like it's his idea.  Wouldn't that piss you the F off?  No.  Why not?  I don't know.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:20:00]  It is hard to do this show.  We just got to depend on the faithful army.  I would love to rip off other things from other radio stations.  There's nothing out there.  There's a lot of bad radio going on.  Sex for Sam, that's what it is.  Rocco, you still have to be with yourself and drive home by yourself and hang out in your apartment, and you know where the idea came from. 
[00:20:30]  You know where all your ideas come from.  You're pathetic.  You don't have an original thought in your body.  Your big, bloated body.  And you ain't going nowhere, and that's the reality of this whole thing.  You're a cheap version of Bubba Love Sponge, another guy who's just stuck in Tampa doing not much.  Douche.  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?

We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Holy ass, I want to riot.  Like a monkey.  Instant feedback just flipping out, Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Bung Mike from Boston.  It is an insult to Boston to assume we will listen to the male version of Rosie O'Donnell.  F that tubby bitch in his crap A.  Nick saying, what's up, guys?  We have a bunch of guys totally tying up AF's phone lines.  We're going to keep it up until that fat F is off the air.  Yeah.  I hope so.  But, you know, an hour will go by and then, you know.  Ah.  You know.  Let's get back to the PlayStation game.  I look, I see a lot of faithful listeners of this program that realize, actually realize why we're pissed off. 
[00:23:00]  And that's fine.  But, you know something?  Guys, you've got to do something about it.  You've got to help us out.  There's sacrifices to be made.  We can't do it all.  Oh, we've got some tricks up our sleeves.  Yeah.  But in the meantime, you've just got to make his on-air life a living hell.  His off-air life.  Well, that'll tumble over into that. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  If he can't take his phone calls, he can't make up all the phony phone calls that he does.  Katie, what's going on?  He can't edit his phone calls.  Listen, Anthony.  Yeah.  Is Anthony there?  Yeah, everyone's there.  Yes, Katie.  Anthony, I'm so disappointed in you.  Why?  Oh, just a negative feedback towards the city of Boston.  We're smarter than that, honey.  Well, you know, it was more me saying, I hope you guys are smarter. 
[00:24:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Do we have more things?  Katie?  Yeah.  You know, this will piss off some people.  I know there are people that are smart enough and know the difference, but there certainly  are people that just will have no clue and will just go along with it and be like,  Oh, man, it's great.  Whatever.  It's just radio and, you know.  We take what we do very seriously.  If you haven't figured that out yet, then I don't know what to tell you guys.  I've broken more equipment in here than I could afford.  I know, but you guys are going to get off the Boston kick.  I mean, I thought the Menino trick was pretty funny. 
[00:24:30]  But we miss you, and you guys keep slamming us.  We're not slamming.  Oh, Katie, we're not slamming you.  Oh!  We hold you close to our hearts.  We're not slamming you.  Oh, with the little Terry and the jokes about the Red Sox.  It broke my heart.  That's all.  It broke my heart.  That's all in fun.  Katie, that's all in fun.  Remember, wow started here.  Started here.  Started here.  Started here.  It started right here.  And I was there for you then, and I'm here for you now.  Of course. 
[00:25:00]  We know that.  You've got to remember where you came from.  We're here for you.  Katie.  What do you want done?  You let us know what you want done.  We hold you guys close.  You know that.  If you guys can't take a joke by now, then you know what?  Then maybe you should go listen to somebody else.  This is all in fun.  I mean, the Red Sox-Yankee thing is always a lot of fun.  It goes back and forth.  Forth with that thing.  We mess with, you know, the Philly fans down in Philadelphia and the Flyer fans and the Eagle fans.  I can start keeping score.  You guys give Boston an awful lot. 
[00:25:30]  We get slammed all the time.  You know what?  You don't even have to listen to us anymore because, you know, Rocco's doing our show anyway.  You got the Rocco.  I didn't like Rocco when you were at A.M.  Thanks.  Hey.  You don't need us.  Because he's doing our stuff just as well as we do, of course.  No.  If it wasn't for me, no one would know about Godsmack.  No one would know about Godsmack if it wasn't for me.  They're not even talented.  It was the fact that I played him.  Believe me, those guys would have done just fine without Rocco airing it. 
[00:26:00]  It was just a matter of time.  Sully and the gang, they gave that CD to every single person in Boston.  It was just a matter of time.  Dang.  Ah.  There you go.  Well, and I guess, you know, we shouldn't take our show seriously anymore.  Well, we don't have to work as hard because, you know what?  People don't really care.  They'll stick with us and, you know?  Yeah.  I don't care.  The listeners are right.  We're taking ourselves too seriously.  Watch how much this show blows when we start to not care. 
[00:26:30]  Something pisses me off.  I'll go, oh, well, and I'll just kind of tap the phone.  Oh, well.  Just, yeah, the Army's out there.  I hope so.  Do your best.  I hope so.  Do your best, boys.  Because we're going to F up things pretty good ourselves.  Yeah.  But we can't do it alone.  And we have had it.  Yeah.  You know, we kind of backed off a little bit. 
[00:27:00]  I think maybe it was our fault.  You know, we heard from a lot of people in the instant feedback.  Whenever we get rolling on a subject like this, dude, move on.  Be funny.  Stop talking about it.  Don't do it.  And you know something?  We did.  And see what happens?  You jackass.  Erin, what's going on?  Nothing.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Hi.  I wanted to be in the mother concert for the Britney Spears.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, why don't we go ahead and switch gears.  Hey, what would you do for tickets to see Enrique Iglesias? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  I will suck on Stalker Patty's toes.  You want to suck on Stalker Patty's toes?  A nasty hammer toes?  A hammer toes, yes.  With those big, disgusting talons?  Yep.  Pretty fierce tickets, I will.  Well, we're doing another Opie and Anthony original.  See, we got to point out the original stuff because it just gets all washy out there where  people don't know where all this stuff comes from after a while. 
[00:28:00]  But Mommy, What Would You Do contest is, well, it's an Opie and Anthony original, but that's  okay.  Hey, Rocco and anyone else, why don't you just take it?  Because I'm taking myself too seriously.  Hey!  Holy crap.  Dave, I got an idea.  Get me some tickets to one of those bands that you extorted for the local show that we  do.  One of the local bands that you extort money from.  And then, uh...  I'm going to do, Daddy, what would you do? 
[00:28:30]  Daddy, let Schlocko pound you in the balloon knot for crappy band tickets.  That's a good one.  I like it.  We all win.  I get to have sex with a man and you get tickets.  The one that could take all of my two-inch monster.  Yeah.  If the girl, uh, well, no girl, uh, just guys in this contest. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, guys.  If you could take my two inches and the weight of my huge belly on your back, you'll win.  So what do I have to do?  Do I have to come down there?  Yeah, we're going to officially start our show now, our little radio show.  Oh, okay.  Now we shouldn't take seriously anymore because everyone's telling us that we're overreacting  here.  No, kick his ass.  What's the problem with the Opie and Anthony show has been the last three months that we  have kind of slacked off in a lot of things. 
[00:29:30]  And one of them is being aggressive and taking things seriously.  And we're back.  Yeah, you should kick his ass.  Anyway, Anthony, we got a great pair of tickets to Britney Spears at Madison Square Garden.  They're actually good tickets.  They're really good.  I mean, Earl could come in here and prove it.  He could tell you the seats so you can look it up online.  But they're really good.  So close, you can see her lip syncing the song.  Right.  So we got the Britney Spears tickets. 
[00:30:00]  Do we have the limo ride yet?  We will have the limo ride.  We're going to have free dinner, spending money.  It's going to be a great night out.  We're asking the mommies what they would do for Britney Spears tickets.  And, Erin, you want to suck on Stalker Patty's hammer toes.  I'll do anything, yep.  You had another idea about getting naked.  And what was that other one you put in the email?  I'll walk around New York City in a trash can that says, holding up the sign, says, I'm white trash.  I'm white trash. 
[00:30:30]  That could be kind of funny.  When you walk around, like, naked with just wearing a bag.  Well, that's kind of like the homeless person we see all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing special in that.  But she just wears just one of those black plastic garbage bags.  A garbage bag?  Yeah, that's all she wears, this lady, begging for change down on the streets of New York.  Would you do that and then walk around with a sign that says, I am white trash?  Yeah.  Erin.  Yes.  From what I hear, you might just be white trash.  How old are you? 
[00:31:00]  19.  You're 19.  And are you a mom?  Yes, I am.  Yes, you are.  And, uh, yes, Obie?  I was going to just set up a little bit.  Um, hold on to your seats, uh, kids.  Yeah.  Uh, Erin.  Yes.  How old is your daughter?  Four.  All right.  Let me do a few.  Do the math.  Do a few calculations here.  Do the math.  Don't forget to add nine months.  Four.  Right.  Right.  Add nine months.  Holy.  How old were you when you were impregnated?  I was like 14 and a half. 
[00:31:30]  Fourteen, you little slut.  How old was the guy?  What?  How old was the guy?  He was 23.  Nice.  Yeah.  Get out.  Is he, is he in, uh, your life still?  No, he's not.  Is he in jail?  No.  All right.  Uh, so how did this come about?  Is he black?  No, he's not black.  Okay.  He just sort of, he wanted me to have the baby tell me, oh, you know, I'll take care  of you.  Everything will be taken care of.  But how do you meet a 23-year-old as a 14-year-old?  Oh, I just knew him through friends and everything.  Yeah.  I bet.  When did he make the move on you?  How old were you then? 
[00:32:00]  I was 14.  Oh, 14.  And a 23-year-old starts making a move on you.  Where was mom and dad?  Um, they're home.  They're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,  Oh my God.  My mom helped me.  Like, I lived with my mom.  You didn't know you could get pregnant?  Yes, I knew.  I just didn't think it would happen.  Was, was he your first?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  He ruined your tight little thing.  He destroyed it.  You got to respect him for not, for like leaving it in.  You got to respect that. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, right?  What a guy.  Yeah, you got to pull that out.  I'd be panicking and, you know, but not this guy.  Oh, good boy.  She's 14 and he's not worried.  Oh my God.  There was no birth control used?  No.  Nice.  Nothing.  He just let loose.  What a guy.  Was it one time, one time only, or were you guys kind of having a lot of sex?  It was one time.  Oh.  One time only and you got pregnant. 
[00:33:00]  Yep.  What's the matter?  You didn't want to, you didn't want to eat the hog?  I would have.  You didn't want that, though.  Oh, I got to finish up that way with a 14-year-old, right, Norton?  Oh, yeah, you have to.  He knows.  I think she won the mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears ticket.  Well, I'll get pregnant at 14.  14.  The only one that tops her is Melissa Drexler.  I'd have to say she should get the Britney Spears tickets.  If you have a kid in a prom and throw it in a trash can, that should earn you.  Yeah, she just got out. 
[00:33:30]  She just got out.  By the way, after how long?  Three years.  Three years of a 15-year sentence.  Yeah, pot dealers do longer than a lady who throws a baby in a trash can.  Threw her baby away.  During the prom.  Yeah.  So, you're there at, what, 15?  Yeah.  And you're having your baby.  Did you have to drop out of the 7th grade at this point?  I just want to put it all in perspective for everyone.  7th grade!  I was in high school.  I finished high school.  Did you go to school with your big pregnant belly? 
[00:34:00]  No, I wasn't allowed.  What?  How could you not be allowed?  They don't let you.  You're a filthy whore!  Hold on.  Demone, I need money for the abortion clinic.  Remember that?  Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Put your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it!  Crawl around like a dog!  Jennifer Jason Leigh got banged by Demone in the pool house.  And she got knocked up and she got the abortion. 
[00:34:30]  Get your bra off and pick it up now!  My boy didn't want me to get the abortion.  He didn't want me to get the abortion.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  No, no, no.  So, uh, Erin.  Yes?  You didn't really hear it.  Maybe they didn't hear that.  The boyfriend didn't want her to get an abortion.  Yeah, he didn't want you to?  No, he told me he'd take care of me and love me and stay with me.  Where is he now?  I don't have a clue.  You're not getting any support or nothing, huh? 
[00:35:00]  Nope, a month after, she was a month old, he disappeared.  Would you have gone for the vacuuming?  You would have went and gotten an abortion?  Probably, yeah.  He had a 14-year-old who would have gotten an abortion and didn't ask him to pull out and he left?  What a dope.  I know.  What's with this guy?  He's like Superman.  He's everything in the dream.  You stupid bitch.  Oh.  So, uh, how is the little abortion?  Oh. 
[00:35:30]  Are you happy now that you didn't?  How is the little mistake?  Oh, I'm happy.  She's good.  So, who raised the kid?  Mom and dad?  I did.  Me and my mom.  Me and your mom.  And she's starting to ask you about daddy?  Yes.  And why she doesn't have one?  And what do you say?  I just say, well, he's going away for a little while.  He'll be back.  Oh.  That's one of those hopes.  Does she ask questions like, mommy, why do we play with the same, uh, same toys?  No, but she's starting to wonder why everybody, because she's in preschool, why everybody else's mother is so much older. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And why I look like somebody, one of her friend's sisters.  Yeah, see?  They're kind of sharp.  Kind of sharp at that age.  So, I have to get her these tickets.  It's the one, she wants sister and a father for Christmas, so.  She what?  She wants the Britney Spears tickets and a father for Christmas.  Oh, what a sad story.  Well, one out of two ain't bad.  What do you look like?  What do you look like?  Yeah, are you, uh, were you a chubby? 
[00:36:30]  No.  Ooh.  Um, like, so like 130 pounds, 5'6", brown hair.  Yeah.  Um, just, you know, average looking.  Average looking, not really anything.  Not a stripper, don't look like a stripper or anything, but.  And you were hot at 14?  You had all your parts, uh, grown and everything?  Yep.  Well, you couldn't wait, could you?  Well, I thought it was love and it's going to last forever.  Well, it's going to, as far as you're concerned, it's going to last forever. 
[00:37:00]  You're going to have that kid.  Did you tell this guy you were older?  No.  He knew how old I was.  14.  How long were you, uh, seeing each other?  Um, like three months.  Three months.  Would he pick you up at, uh, junior high?  How, yeah, how was he able to see you?  I mean, weren't your parents freaking you were out?  Yeah.  Hanging with a 23-year-old at 14?  Well, they didn't know.  I said, oh, I was going to a party or, oh, I'm going to spend the night at my friend's house.  What was your curfew at 14? 
[00:37:30]  Um, I think like.  Right when it blew.  11, 10.30.  Right when the goo blew.  Curfew.  What aim this guy has, too.  One time in, all of a sudden, she's knocked up.  I know.  Sharpshooter.  Oh, sharpshooter.  Another winner of the unlucky lottery.  Erin, one time, one time only.  Bam!  That's good.  You're, uh, dating now and everything?  Yes, I am.  Trying to find a daddy, though, now, right?  It's not just about effing. 
[00:38:00]  God, 19 and your life is like this.  Yeah.  You should just be effing.  And all you want to do for the Britney Spears tickets is suck on Stalker Paddy's hammer toes?  I'll do anything for the Britney Spears tickets.  Huh.  Yeah, well, obviously you'll do anything.  Hey.  Boy, you take all the fun out of it.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'll be this kid's father.  This kid? 
[00:38:30]  How old are you?  How old am I?  I'm 29.  Oh.  Hey, I'll do it.  I know I won't have a problem getting any.  Hey.  Yeah, do you still do some of that effing there, Erin?  Only with my boyfriend.  So you have a steady boyfriend.  Yeah.  What does he do for a living?  Oh, he's still in college.  Oh, he's still in high school.  No.  So how old are you?  I tried.  Thanks, guys.  Hi, Mike.  Erin, how old is your mom?  Uh, she's like 48. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, an older, older.  Well, you're 19?  Yeah.  19.  29.  29.  29.  Well, I guess we found our first contestant for Mommy.  What would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Uh, you'll come down Friday.  Okay.  You gotta come up with something a little better than just sucking on Sucker Patty's, uh...  Yeah, it's disgusting and everything, but, you know, then it's over.  What else do you want me to do?  Would you eat one of her boogers?  Oh.  It's no shooting a bottle rocket, uh... 
[00:39:30]  Oh, I know, but I don't know what else to do.  All right, hold on, you're too good.  We're gonna have to have you in the contest.  Yeah.  Okay, thank you.  Hey, I hear a dog in the background.  Yeah.  Oh, I just said I hear a dog in the background.  That's all I said.  Thanks for getting that.  Dale from Jersey wants to know if you ever saw the, this is, it's like being grounded  for 18 years poster in high school.  It's like being grounded for 18 years to a little baby. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, it's not that bad.  Can I ask what type of dog you have?  It's a Dalmatian.  Oh, those things are a pain in the ass.  They like peanut butter.  Would you be willing to put on some pink lipstick?  All right, hold on the line.  Okay, thank you.  Any other further questions for Erin?  The pink lips.  We done with Erin in?  Yeah.  Okay, Erin, you're coming down Friday, all right?  Okay.  I'll be honest with you.  If you suck on, you know, Stalker Patty's hammer toes with the really long nails that she 
[00:40:30]  doesn't cut because it's too sensitive, that would be really gross, but I don't know if  it's gonna, you know, win the tickets.  Oh, so I have to do something else?  Well, I don't know.  You should keep thinking, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Thanks.  Get her info.  Yeah.  Wow.  Winner.  That's something, huh?  One time, one time only.  Wow.  That's something.  That guy must have ran for the hills, man.  You could go to jail for that.  Fourteen.  Her parents really didn't seem to be on the ball there.  Yeah.  They should have, like, she was on the ball. 
[00:41:00]  They should have noticed that she got pregnant.  Who did it?  Where is he?  You know, she said, oh, the guy was, let's ask where her father was.  Sticking around.  Erin?  Yeah.  Did you have a father involved with this whole thing?  No.  There you go.  The old fatherless girls.  When did Daddy leave the house?  When I was, like, three.  Yeah.  And Mom was too busy banging the other guys?  No. 
[00:41:30]  My mom's a professional.  She's not the best.  Oh, professional.  Professional.  No.  She gets paid for it.  Huh.  So you had no father.  No.  So you were looking for a father figure.  What the hell is that?  At 14, she finds this older guy.  Oh, my God.  Mom's not around, right?  Your textbook.  She's too busy working to pay the bills, right?  Yeah.  You were kind of like a latchkey kid.  Not really, but...  Do you know where Daddy is now? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, he lives in Manhattan.  I know where he is, but...  Oh, he does?  He doesn't want anything to do with us, so...  Aww.  Of course, with a slut daughter like you.  Aww.  I wouldn't want anything to do with you, either.  What?  Aww.  You guys are so mean.  You got Daddy and his little girl is out there at 14 spreading them?  I think Erin's hot.  Yes.  There's something ironic about this whole story.  Yeah, it's 14.  That would be the ironic question.  All right, Erin.  Hold on to the line. 
[00:42:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  There you go.  A little more info on that.  Kelly, you there?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I want you to do a contest that doesn't have mothers involved.  Why?  Because I'm not a mother.  And you want the Britney Spears tickets?  Yeah.  Why?  How old are you?  28.  And why do you want to see Britney so bad?  Yeah, I like her.  I always liked her.  I got to interrupt you for a second.  Jay on line three on the National.  He goes, with Erin, you need to play What Won't You Do for Tickets. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  You want me to crawl back when I think of something?  Yeah, or find a, like a mommy.  I mean, you know.  What, find a mommy?  Yeah, get a mommy to help you out with the contest.  I'm serious.  All right.  Well, none of my girlfriends are mothers.  No?  No.  All right.  Well, figure it out.  Bye.  Bye.  This is so much hotter when it's mommy.  What would you do?  Imagine the doctor.  She's 15, and she's got to be laid out there so they could just probe and grab that kid 
[00:43:30]  out of there.  Yeah.  Kids' parts look the same as the mom's.  Oh.  She had the kid when she was 15, right?  Fitting.  Wow.  Knocked up at 14.  That's insane.  That's insane.  All right.  Well, that threw us off track, obviously.  We're going to take a quick break, and we want to take more calls from you mommies out  there.  Yeah, mommies.  What will you do for Britney tickets?  We're getting our contestants together for Friday's show, which is going to be a bang-up 
[00:44:00]  show.  It's going to be great.  So far, we've got Erin, 19, with a four-year-old kid.  Maybe she could...  Here, get Erin on the line.  Maybe she'll do something with the kid.  What's she going to do with the kid?  Kid's four.  You sick ass.  I just said, you know, it doesn't mean it has to be anything bad.  Bad, bad?  Bad, bad.  Not even bad, bad.  Just bad is bad.  Not even bad.  All right.  We'll be back.  Mommies, give us a call.  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's, Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets? 
[00:44:30]  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What is that?  Sounds like an unemployed radio personality. 
[00:45:00]  Just the noise from our first rant of the day, Anthony.  I hear.  That's a new noise.  You hear the new Gorillaz song?  Ben, you hear the noise?  You see the video?  Isn't that cool?  That thing's great, man.  What a great band.  Hey, you like those guys a lot.  Yeah.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kevin from the Upper East Side on the instant feedback.  Talking about that Erin.  Getting frightening at 14.  Yeah.  She's now 19, has a four-year-old. 
[00:45:30]  Kevin wants to know if his name was Ron Johnson, audio consultant.  Hey, Ron Johnson.  You know, if her daughter turns out to be the same type of slut that she was, she could be a grandma at 33.  Grandma.  Imagine that.  Grandma at 33.  If her daughter is as big a slut as she is.  And people are worrying about cloning.  Human cloning.  You know who's worried about human cloning? 
[00:46:00]  Fat people and ugly people because they know they're going to be slowly weeded out.  Weeded out, right?  When you could kind of build your own person there?  Sure.  Yeah, exactly.  No one's going to ask for a kid with a head the size of this desk.  You're going to ask for a normal smart child.  No more mongoloids.  Exactly.  Let's worry about teen pregnancy and worrying about, you know, how to prevent girls from throwing their kids into dumpsters during the prom before we worry about cloning.  I actually agree with what she did.  I like the cloning. 
[00:46:30]  Here's a little taste of reality with the cloning thing.  We're wasting energy on this one.  We cannot stop it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Do you think, do you honestly think that this is the first, you know, they cloned a human, well, you know.  They cloned an embryo.  A human embryo, and it just divided a few times.  But do you think this is the first time we've done that?  No.  No way.  I'm sure it's been done before.  It's been done.  Hey, I cloned a bit.  Check it out.  It looks exactly like another bit. 
[00:47:00]  But it's retarded.  Something went wrong.  Because I don't know how to pull it off.  You know what the amazing thing is about the cloning?  You don't need the man.  The man, not necessary to get the egg to start dividing and turn into a little fetus.  That's kind of odd.  And the religious people are the ones that have problems with this.  No one else cares.  There's not one person that when you hear, everyone has this whole vision that it's going to be some Frankenstein thing happening. 
[00:47:30]  Where these little embryos are floating in these glass jars in a factory.  That's what I think.  I saw the South Park episode.  Right.  Where they cloned a three-ass monkey.  Right.  Yeah.  No, it's all about cloning.  A lot of it is organs.  They want to make organs for non-rejectable organs.  If you have a chance that they could take a few cells off of an organ and clone that organ and all of a sudden you need a liver, there's your liver. 
[00:48:00]  It's a replica of your liver.  Why would you have a problem with that?  You don't have to take the rest of your life rejection drugs or a heart or anything else.  The people that have problems with it, no one in their right mind has a problem with this.  It's the religious people.  The people that think you're tinkering with their invisible man's world.  It's not.  The invisible man.  It's the magical person.  It's not God's way. 
[00:48:30]  It's not God.  It's not God's way.  Man is playing God.  Don't you think if there's this God and he gave us the ability to do this?  I'm talking like one of these freakazoid retards right now.  And there is this almighty God and he gave humans the ability to do this.  Don't you think it's fine?  Don't you think things like that are fine and that it's man's uptightness and bull crap that makes you pull God into this whole thing?  It's the religious. 
[00:49:00]  That's what it is.  I think God's universe, Anthony, is like a snow globe.  Is that what it is?  Like one of those things you shake up?  A little snow globe and there's a lot of stuff going on in there.  And, you know, everything in that snow globe is fair business.  Yeah.  And we're mixing things up and figuring stuff out.  I'm from the school of no God.  That's the school of thought I'm from.  I just believe that through some wacky stuff that's too huge for us to understand.  Can't talk about this.  Oh, it'll freak you out.  I know. 
[00:49:30]  No, I don't like to think about this stuff.  But if my theory is right, then whatever we do is fine and dandy.  You know what I mean?  You want to clone organs.  You want to clone a whole person.  Who cares?  There's already test tube babies.  We've already had our hands in that mix.  Didn't we have a problem with that for a while?  Of course.  The religious, they were freaking out again.  Oh, my God.  It's, uh, you're playing God again.  Because they picture the little fetus floating in a test tube, you know.  Here's how you get the church to back up cloning.  You start cloning altar boys. 
[00:50:00]  And you guarantee they'll be smooth and hairless forever.  Well, you could genetically engineer things where maybe there aren't pain receptors in their balloon knots.  You know?  And they black out when testifying.  Perfect.  Perfect.  That's it.  See?  An altar boy with three S's.  Oh, this just, well, the Vatican has all of a sudden changed their old stance on it.  But, yeah, the Vatican's got to step in. 
[00:50:30]  And, uh, it's all sensational journalism, too.  Like, you get on Drudge the other day, and the whole front page was, human cloned.  President speaks out.  They weren't cloning a human.  They weren't trying to clone.  They cloned an embryo, a little piece of a cell that divided a few times.  What freaked me out is they got the piece off the guy's leg.  Yeah.  They just took a piece of his leg, a little microscopic piece of his leg, and was able to.  That's it.  So, that's pretty cool.  That's amazing. 
[00:51:00]  It's quite amazing how they do this.  But then, you read that a human's cloned.  And then another part of my theory.  I don't think a dividing cell is a human.  I don't care what the church thinks about that.  They're all up and on to that stem cell stuff, you know?  We don't want that.  You know how many people that could help?  Yep.  And don't believe me, I don't care.  I don't care about helping people either.  But I just think if it's going to be out there, do it.  You know what I mean?  The religious, oh, God, who told you? 
[00:51:30]  Where's in the Bible does it say you can't do stem cell research?  There were monkeys back then.  Goddamn monkeys.  With their big quill pens writing crap down for us to listen to now.  Get out of here.  No one even knew where the hell we were going back then.  Flat earth.  Kiss my ass.  Stop.  You're freaking me out.  Well, it's not true.  First of all, the Bible was written 300 years after Christ's death.  It was pieced together to, you know, make the church one.  And second of all, all these people in wheelchairs that you could help walk again  and the beauty of watching them just re-injure themselves. 
[00:52:00]  You think Chris and Marie would, like, get back on a horse again?  He'd walk and it would just be great to hire someone to just run and shove them.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  But the reality is you can't stop this one.  No, it's stuff that you can't stop.  It's overjointed.  It's called technology.  It's called human will.  Yeah, if somehow we stop it in our country, it's going to happen somewhere else.  And I think it's a lot further than they're letting on to. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're showing us, yeah, we did this little thing and took a piece from his leg  and now we cloned a little embryo thing.  I would bet money that there's going to be a clone born soon.  Human clone born soon.  Probably in another country.  You would be nuts to even talk about it if you're working on it because look what happens.  Right.  Now, this doctor, I see him on all these shows.  He's got to justify himself in front of a panel of Jesus freaks.  Yeah.  And whatnot.  Sitting there talking about how God told him that I got to now tell you that you can't do that. 
[00:53:00]  And you know something?  What business is it of yours if some guy wants to clone something and burn in hell for eternity if that's where you end up?  Why do they feel they got to save everybody?  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, ONA?  You know, it's all hypocritical anyway because, you know, supposedly we're supposed to have free will, right?  But the minute we use this free will, what happens?  Now they're all up in arms.  You can't do this.  You can't do that.  That's their cop-out line. 
[00:53:30]  That's the cop-out line.  It's like, well, look, if you turn around and say, we're doing this because we have the ability to do it.  We've reached the point in technology with our brains that we're able to do this.  And then they go, wait, no, no.  Free will.  God gave it to us.  We have the ability, the freedom to F up so he can then kill us for eternity.  Gee, thanks, God.  You know, it doesn't make sense.  Chris, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:54:00]  Hey, wasn't Eve a clone of Adam according to the Bible?  And didn't they take a rib from Adam or something?  A little rib, you know, a piece of her leg or his rib.  Rib, piece of a guy's leg, same thing.  Hey, you know.  Depends on which book by ancient people you wrote.  Would you read any book that was written that long ago and put any credence in it whatsoever for anything?  Everything else they wrote about was wrong back then.  Cut it out.  Wrong.  You're freaking me out again.  The planets, they thought the Earth was in the middle and everything whipped around it. 
[00:54:30]  La, la, la, la.  There were people that thought the Earth was a plate resting on a tortoise's back.  La, la, la.  It's the same people.  La, la, la.  I need faith.  Shut up.  No.  It's ridiculous.  Don't want to think about it.  Everything they wrote back then was proven wrong.  I need my faith.  Thank you.  Yet the Bible, for some reason, everything is absolutely correct in it.  All the little fictional stories that should be in sci-fi movies.  Everything's fine and dandy.  Tim, what's going on?  Tim? 
[00:55:00]  Hello?  Hey.  Jim, a name that ends with I am, whatever your name is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm on the side of God on this one, but I agree with you guys totally.  If God didn't want us to make clones, then he wouldn't have made it in the test tube there,  you know?  He wouldn't put it in the little snow globe that he calls his universe.  Exactly.  He put a lot of things in that snow globe for us to mess with and fool around with.  These people are worried about what's going to happen to the souls of these things.  Hey, it proves their point if every one of these things has a different soul, you know? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I would love to know.  All right.  That's a clone of me.  It doesn't have the same soul.  Is it thinking the same thoughts I'm thinking right now?  Or the thoughts I had when I was its age?  Exactly.  You guys suck.  The problem with religious people is they're afraid that it's because their faith is so  fragile, they're afraid that it's going to be proven that there isn't a soul.  Or so they're afraid that science will disprove.  They are always keeping tabs on science because of exactly what you just said, Norton. 
[00:56:00]  If science someday proves that there is no soul, there's no God, you lose out.  I know.  We're freaking you out.  I mean, what's their explanation on dinosaurs and stuff like that?  I've heard this.  They say that Adam and Eve was first things on Earth, blah, blah, blah.  And then we have the scientists that give a very good argument about evolution. 
[00:56:30]  And yet they just toss it aside and say, no, there were people around the same time there  were dinosaurs.  That's what they say.  Well, there's no proof of that.  Don't matter.  I have my faith.  I have my faith.  Well, science has proven it.  No, I got my faith.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They read, they take the Bible literally.  They won't just look at it as symbolic.  Like one day didn't mean 24 hours, you jackasses.  It's symbolism.  Oh, what a sound.  Oh, he's freaking out.  I need my faith.  I need my faith. 
[00:57:00]  Uh, Malachi.  Malachi.  Hello.  Yes, Opie and Anthony.  What's your name, Malachi?  I'm listening to your show as one of my guilty pleasures.  What's your name, Maliki?  Malachi.  It was Malachi.  It's a biblical name.  My parents were a little heavy on that stuff.  Oh, boy.  All right.  But I want you to understand why cloning is wrong.  Cloning is wrong because God does put before us choices to make to show the strength of our  characters in various situations.  Who said this?  It's common morality. 
[00:57:30]  It's how, you know, how the world is set before us.  Who made this rule?  That we must make these choices.  Dude, who made this rule?  I think it's a rule of man.  Who thought this up?  It's an interpretation of the word of God.  What word of God?  Where was that written?  In the Holy Bible.  The Bible.  That was written by people a million, not a million, thousands of years ago.  Some people would say the Bible is the literal word of God.  Now, obviously, that's not true.  The people who wrote the Bible in their terms, they would tell stories using metaphors. 
[00:58:00]  And through metaphors and through various other things, they would try to tell stories in  a way that the people would be able to understand it.  But it doesn't make it any less true.  The word of God is still the word of God.  Malachi, Malachi.  I have a question.  What about all the stuff that was left out of the Bible?  Because the stories that made it into the Bible were voted on, and that's how they became  the Bible.  What about all the stuff that was left out?  There are certain things that the people who were in power at the time certainly felt 
[00:58:30]  maybe that would be beyond the ability of some of these people to comprehend.  It's up to interpretation, the whole thing.  Right.  And I am interpreting it that we are just here to do whatever the hell we want.  And cloning is wrong.  Why?  Because it has humans to kind of take a power that was not given to us except in the manner  of procreation.  How is it not given to us?  If we have the ability to do it, it was given to us. 
[00:59:00]  If it wasn't supposed to be given to us, then God is not infallible, is he?  But we are given choices of what is wrong.  That's a cop-out!  Of the nature of God as we are able to.  God is an infinite being, whereas we are finite beings, and there's a finite level to  which we can understand.  All right.  Malachi, look.  Then you could stay home and not clone things.  Okay?  But the people that believe it is not interfering with God, why is there a problem with cloning  that?  Why should the church step in and try to stop cloning? 
[00:59:30]  They shouldn't.  Okay.  Thank you.  People are left to make their choices, and I think that the people from the church who  wish to condemn everything, they condemn it all they want.  It's the people who try to stop it that are wrong.  They're not going to be able to stop people from fornicating.  They're not going to be able to stop it.  Fornicating.  I love that word.  They're not going to be able to stop that.  Geez, can I go to Doc Baker?  I have a cold.  Don't be fornicating.  I've got to go to Sleepy Eye tonight.  People who try to live and they choose to live the way they choose to live.  It's called apnea. 
[01:00:00]  Fornicator.  All right.  Thank you, Malachi.  Thank you.  Malachi.  Malachi.  Malachi.  Malachi.  You're right.  Are you in a wheelchair?  No.  See, it's amazing.  My wife, Elvira, excuse me, Elvira, she's of great strength to me in all of this.  No, no.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like if you're a preacher.  You sound like a preacher.  No, just a good old son of a boy.  It's easy to say when you're not in a wheelchair that stem cell research, but if you haven't  walked in 10 years, stem cell research is a nice option.  Yeah, would be nice.  I don't see a problem personally with stem cell research. 
[01:00:30]  It's the use of the...  We're all a bunch of selfish son of a bitches, too, because it's like, hey, I'm not in the  wheelchair.  Screw the stem cell.  It's the only way to get it.  It doesn't affect my life.  Screw them.  It's wrong.  You don't have to go and get it from babies.  No, you're not going to get it from babies.  How many people in wheelchairs are saying stem cell research is wrong?  Exactly.  I'm sure that are stupid enough to say that, but in general, they're all for it.  How about a parent whose little kid has cancer?  You don't want them to be able to cure that because of some stupid embryo?  Please, keep making them and throw the rest of them in the dumpster. 
[01:01:00]  All right, Malachi.  Yes?  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Hey, no problem.  I enjoy your show nonetheless.  Don't have to agree with you.  They like you.  All right.  No, we don't care.  This is what we think.  All right.  Well, we agree to disagree then.  Have a fine day, gentlemen.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  One of the stupidest sayings ever.  We'll agree to disagree.  Well, you know.  I like him, though.  He's all right.  Malachi is all right.  Yeah.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  You know what? 
[01:01:30]  The church needs effed up things to be walking around.  Anytime we talk about genetics where we could weed out little kids like P-Boy.  Hey, I'm a normal kid.  I'm nine years old, yet I'm in the body of a 95-year-old man.  You know, if that could be wiped off the face of the earth and everything could be fine through science,  then maybe in many, many years there won't be this need to have such faith in things  because science will be able to take care of a lot of the problems that people have. 
[01:02:00]  So the church has to keep problems around.  They've got to keep guilt around.  They've got to keep kids around, unwanted children around,  just so you can then run to the church when you run out of resources,  and they'll be there for you to, you know, take you and your money and everything else.  There's a balance people can find between religion and science that makes sense.  You know, people are just nuts either way.  They're either 100% one way or 100% the other way.  Yeah, it's the fanatics each way.  Absolutely. 
[01:02:30]  I'm a fanatic the other way.  Hey, let's get back to the comedy with a little ditty by Stephen Lynch.  It's about a priest.  Oh, very good.  I want to just tell everyone that Stephen Lynch's parents,  his father was a priest and his father was a nun.  And they got it on and got excommunicated from the Catholic Church.  And Stephen Lynch was born.  Yeah.  From a priest and a nun.  So this is where Stephen Lynch is coming from with this little song. 
[01:03:00]  Find the 666 on his head.  It's written from the perspective of a priest that I knew many years ago  when I was going through some troubled times.  I went to him for some advice and love advice.  I'm sure he helped you.  He helped me out a great deal.  You're not a person anymore.  Great.  Jesus.  Deep in prayer my cross to bear  I kneel upon the floor  Temptations of a Catholic priest aren't easy to ignore 
[01:03:30]  But I cannot control myself  It rips my soul apart  For one small sheep among my flock  Has stolen a shepherd's heart  Altar boy, altar boy  Confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God 
[01:04:00]  Inside my rectory  At Sunday math or Bible class  I catch him in my view  So I close my eyes  But there he lies  Spread eagled on the pew  And when I see him in that frock  My conscience goes awry 
[01:04:30]  I'll give him some communion  Wine that's spiked with Spanish fly  Altar boy  Altar boy  Is it gonna be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long  If you promise never to tell  My father 
[01:05:00]  Once and ever  Hallowed be thy name  I could dress him up  I could dress him up like the Pope  And then I'd  Oh dear God  The shame  No, no  Lead us not into temptation  Deliver us from sin  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ  And I was Mary Magdalene  Yeah  Altar boy 
[01:05:30]  Altar boy  Confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God  Inside my rectory  Oh altar boy  Oh altar boy  Confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God  Inside my rectory 
[01:06:00]  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God  You will find the grace of God 
[01:06:30]  You will find the grace of God  The Opie and Anthony Show have been removed from the airwaves.  Well, that was...  I shouldn't have offended too many people, right?  I didn't swear.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:00]  Chyner.  Should be calling it soon.  Can't call her that anymore, can you?  Chyner?  Can't call her Chyner.  Chyna.  From the WWF.  What's her real name?  Used to be for the WWF.  Her name's Chyner.  Joni, what?  Joni, that's funny.  Isn't her real name, Joni?  Hey.  Burtis writes,  Can't we clone little Asian kids to do all the work so we can drink beer and play F and Nintendo all day long? 
[01:07:30]  I thought you raised an interesting point, by the way.  You want to bring this up on the air?  Yeah, I want to.  All right.  Do you guys want the sickest visual ever, ever, ever?  We're talking about cloning, okay?  Now, you've got to assume, though, with my theory, that giving yourself an oral treat, let's say, is not gay.  Or my theory doesn't work at all.  Well, it's kind of part of your own body, so... 
[01:08:00]  Wait.  What?  All right.  Go ahead.  Crawl in that barrel.  It's wide open and waiting.  Let's suspend reality for a minute here, actually.  All right.  We'll suspend reality.  Or my theory has no merit.  All right.  It's something you were hashing over during commercial break.  Well, let me ask Norton.  Norton?  Norton?  If you give yourself oral treats, is that gay?  Now, is this...  Wait a minute.  Before you answer, is this...  Your back has the ability to bend yourself over so you can do that? 
[01:08:30]  That's what oral treats are.  All right.  Norton?  Is it gay?  Absolutely not.  All right.  Absolutely not.  If you can do that, if you're a hell of a guy and can actually do that, not gay.  No, I think.  Because it's part of your own body.  It's kind of like if you were sucking on your thumb.  Exactly.  Yeah, it explodes with custard.  What?  Just don't try to chew the nail off.  It's like if you're sucking on your thumb.  Yeah, it's just like it.  You know, you get a wound on your knee and you suck the blood out a little bit. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  It's all part of your body, right?  Oh, sure.  Sure it is.  So then the visual, we take the step further with this whole cloning thing.  If I wanted to know, as long as we all assume that that's not gay, if you clone an exact replica of yourself...  And he's exactly like yourself.  Exact.  Same haircut, the worst.  Every beauty mark, hole in the same spot, every... 
[01:09:30]  Looks like you're looking in the mirror.  Exactly.  Complete exact copy of yourself.  Uh-huh.  And then you give your clone an oral treat.  Now, is that gay?  Absolutely not.  No, that is so gay.  It's perfectly acceptable.  The thing that would even...  Now, I didn't...  I did not answer that question.  No, call the phone.  I just threw that one out.  Call the phone.  The thing...  If you're going to make a statement like that...  Right.  I want to put myself in a safe area here. 
[01:10:00]  A safe haven.  Even if you're going to...  I think I'm even safe on this one.  No.  Because he went way into F.R.  Even if you're going to present this little equation, you have to present it in a...  If you have an exact clone.  Exact.  And the clone gives you oral treats.  All right.  If you're giving the clone oral treats, you're absolutely gay.  Absolutely.  Because you're hobbing a knob.  Now, if the clone gives you oral treats, is that gay? 
[01:10:30]  If you're presenting this, I still am from the school that I believe this, too, is quite  a gay thing to do.  What do you mean, if the clone does?  How about if you're doing it at the same time?  Oh, there you go.  No, it's not gay.  All right.  And what if you...  And also, you involve a stinky pinky.  And let me...  Yeah.  Let me take your...  Let me take your theory...  Let me take what you said a little further here, then.  Okay?  Don't pull down any zippers yet.  No.  What?  How much further do you want to take this?  Do you take care of yourself there? 
[01:11:00]  There have been occasions.  Okay.  So...  All right.  Why isn't that gay?  Let me think.  Uh-huh.  Because it's...  Maybe I should put it a different way.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Perhaps I should word it differently.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Then I just did there and got dumped out of.  Holy S.  Let's say...  Okay.  Who said you were going to do that?  You've got to finish the job. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  But you don't have to do it that way.  All right.  Hold the phone now.  We're entering some touchy ground.  Oh, we are.  When you're doing a handy, let's say, you're taking care of yourself in the standard way.  Why isn't that gay?  Because the byproduct is readily cleansed with a Kleenex or something.  It is not something that you have to go, puh, puh.  And then you're saying...  Hold on then. 
[01:12:00]  And then you're saying...  So then...  And then you look like it's crazy.  You're like, well, you wouldn't finish if you would have your clone doing that.  Following your theory, then, you can blah, blah as long as you don't puh, puh, and you're not gay.  No, the whole thing is gay.  You're the one making the analogy or the similarity between that crank and the wah, wah.  What's the difference between the hand and the wah, wah?  And you said because you're not puh, puh.  So that means if you're wah, waned without the puh, puh, it's not gay.  It's just like the hand. 
[01:12:30]  No, I didn't say that.  Stop it.  If you wah, wahed without the puh, puh, you're just a bad date.  Be a trooper and finish the job for yourself.  So you would actually have to do some ingesting.  I would.  Oh, my God.  Balloon not tongue in.  On your clone?  Yep, the whole nine yards.  My life stinks, and I would make it up to him.  Exactly what I always wanted, I would give my clone.  That is hysterical. 
[01:13:00]  Compliment the girth constantly.  That is the sickest visual ever, right there.  It does open up a lot of areas for debate, let's say.  There's a lot of questions that would go on if you could clone yourself.  Yeah, there's a picture of that guy.  He don't need a clone.  Look at him.  What a trooper.  Look at that.  That's why he's at home.  You don't leave your house if you could do that.  How does your spine bend like that?  It's great.  Also with the cloning, there's a little problem of, you know, just because you're cloned doesn't mean that you're going to rapidly age up to your own age now. 
[01:13:30]  So you'd have this nice little tyke, crinkle, crinkle, these confused little steps in that bag.  What am I doing to me?  It's a mini me.  What am I doing to me?  A mini me.  Just remember, it's my little secret.  Confused little lad.  Crinkle, crinkle in that bag in the stall. 
[01:14:00]  See, he wouldn't be yours to just do what you will with.  He would be a person.  Maybe he's got a problem.  Not if you keep him in the closet.  Just shame him in the closet for favors.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's, I don't think it's quite right, let's say.  And there is definitely a difference between, there's definitely a difference between the hand crank and that. 
[01:14:30]  Just because you don't finish.  All right.  You never actually, say at the end of certain hand-tapped things, you never actually, you know, oh, my face.  You never did that?  I have, dude.  I really have.  It was like footage from 1965 Birmingham. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, my God.  So you've had some facial contact with some of your byproduct.  Without, you know, without intending to.  Interesting.  It's like, wow, this is a good movie.  God, is that sick.  We must move on.  Lance, what's up?  Lance.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I have a theory on why this is usually. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, my clone.  No, you're thinking about women, right?  But if you have a unit in your mouth, you have a unit in your mouth.  How can you think about chicks and there's something in your mouth?  You don't.  You think about yourself and how happy you're making yourself.  But there's still something in your mouth.  Dude, it's like a Crystal Light commercial.  You believe in you.  All right, Lance, Lance, Lance.  Yeah, what's up?  All right.  Good point, but they're going to. 
[01:16:00]  They dumped that problem.  Yeah, let's not.  A unit?  All right.  No, let's be nice.  No, it was the other thing.  But thank you.  All right, no problem.  Lance was trying to help us out, but I don't think he made the radio.  All right, Ant.  Can you double team your girlfriend with your clone?  Oh, how great would that be?  As Austin Powers did.  Well, we're waiting for China to call in.  Oh, yeah?  Should be any moment now.  All right, Ant?  Yeah.  I am going to go to Duane Reade. 
[01:16:30]  Our fine drugstore here.  And get a bottle of NyQuil.  And I am going to be in some other dimension.  I'm going to go to a dimension that has no height, maybe.  I'll go to that one.  Just two dimensions or maybe four.  Oh, my God.  I got to see.  Look up at the light.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Here, bless you. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, Anthony, speaking of wrestling.  This sucks.  Speaking of wrestling.  God, anthrax.  You don't have anthrax because you've got the runny nose.  I told you already.  Well, thank you, Dr. Opie.  People are doing tests and stuff, and you know.  It's funny.  No, I heard it.  It's on the way in today.  Anthrax has similar symptoms as the flu, but the key difference, if you have anthrax,  you don't have the runny nose.  No snot.  No runny nose.  All right.  Yeah, China's going to be calling in a little bit here.  What do you think of Raw?  Well, it used to be called Raw's War. 
[01:17:30]  Or WWF Raw last night.  Well, Vince McMahon is hysterical.  He's a billionaire.  We all know that.  And yet, he will go out and make a complete buffoon of himself.  Is that some of the funniest stuff you have seen in a long time?  Very funny.  The last ten minutes of Raw last night were hilarious.  Vince McMahon is on this whole kick where he has wrestlers come in the ring and kiss his butt.  Kiss his ass.  So far, one has done it before last night.  Regal there. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  William Regal.  And last night, he was trying to get Stone Cold to kiss his ass.  Right.  And it didn't work out.  No.  Kiss my ass.  It was hilarious.  Here's a guy.  He's worth what?  A billion dollars?  Yeah.  Very rich.  He's doing a strip tease in the middle of the ring last night.  Pulled down his little black briefs.  Cheek huggers.  Yeah.  They were like little...  Almost G-string. 
[01:18:30]  Then he's doing his little...  His ass dance.  Yeah.  A little butt move.  He shakes his ass.  He makes Stone Cold put on the chapstick.  Did you also notice he had tan lines?  Yeah.  I'm tanning my ass.  And he tells Stone Cold...  Where is it?  Here it is.  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  It's like this big thing now.  It was beyond hilarious. 
[01:19:00]  Of course, Stone Cold did not do it.  Punched him in the yam bag.  Right.  And then Vince went down.  And now his butt is exposed to a national audience and the people in the arena.  And then Stone Cold proceeds to spank him with his belt.  Yeah.  When did wrestling turn into a Mapplethorpe painting?  This is so aggravating.  It was homoerotic.  It really was.  It was homoeroticism.  It was hilarious.  All men.  A bunch of men in the ring. 
[01:19:30]  One man's ass is hanging out.  He's laying down and another man, another big man, is beating his ass with a strap.  Where there is welts on it.  Yeah.  And then later, another man grabs another man and shoves that man's face in the other man's ass.  Right.  Well-muscled abs.  And then he dances around the ring after Jim Ross ended up kissing his butt.  With Jim Ross' cowboy hat in his hand, galloping around the ring with his pants down, smacking his ass with Jim Ross' hat. 
[01:20:00]  It was the gayest thing.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Yes, don't call.  After, that was after Vince shook his ass.  You're the ugliest strip rob ever said in my life.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  On your knees.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not? 
[01:20:30]  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  You're the ugliest strip rob ever said in my life.  It's all about Vince's ass now.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Sexy?  Well, it's all about Vince's ass.  I got to tell you, you know, the ratings are starting to go up again.  Vince McMahon, he'll do anything to get those ratings up.  I asked our own Ken Stevens if he's going to walk around and ask people to kiss his butt to get the ratings up here in New York.  Kiss my ass. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, it's getting really weird.  It's getting funny.  It was hilarious.  So watch, because then when Stone Cold is on his knees behind Vince, he's inches away from Vince's ass.  Yeah, nothing is on at this point.  Vince has that dopey smile and it says, like, he's going to kiss my ass.  And Stone Cold takes his arm, swings it, and hits him right in the yambag.  Does the china move, right?  Sends Vince belly first down to the mat, and Stone Cold then takes his belt off and starts beating Vince's bare ass all over the ring. 
[01:21:30]  Vince has that panicked, pained look on his face as Stone Cold is raising welts on Vince's ass.  Unbelievable.  And the whole thing now, and of course, Vince is stealing bits from Rocco, by the way.  JR is laughing.  And Vince saw that JR was laughing, so that's why he dragged JR up into the ring and made him kiss his ass. 
[01:22:00]  In front of his hometown, yeah.  Jim Ross plays that role perfectly.  Hell no.  Hell no.  I can't believe it.  Now I kiss Vince's ass, now the other side of my mouth won't move.  Hell no.  You going to kiss my ass or not?  Freaking Vince, man.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[01:22:30]  Stone Cold's the face.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  When are they going to just, you know, start giving other men the yellow discipline right in the middle of the ring?  It was over the top key last night, but it was worth a chunk of it.  Lay down in the ring.  Right.  I've had a lot of water to drink today.  Pass the asparagus.  That's it.  Open your mouth.  Al, what's up?  Yo, this is the gayest half hour of radio I think I have ever heard. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, come on.  What are you doing?  The reason that the ratings went up on WWF last night is because all the gay guys were calling each other, telling them, look, Vince's ass is on the radio.  It was.  Vince played.  That's a great ass.  Not a blemish on it.  It was a blemish.  She's saying.  It was hilarious.  Not a blemish on it.  No, but it was definitely pretty funny.  And, yes, when you're on your knees in front of your clone, you are definitely gay.  All right.  Thank you.  That's the end of it.  Thank you. 
[01:23:30]  Have a good day.  Could you just see the pitch meeting for that whole segment when it started, Vince?  All right.  I'm going to enter the ring, and I'm going to pull my pants down and show my ass, and each week we'll pick one of you to kiss my ass.  What do you think, guys?  We've got to get Shane on.  Shane McMahon.  Yeah.  What does he think about his father getting pretty much naked in the ring?  This so-called find a string.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  I don't know, Vince, but you look to be about 53 years old. 
[01:24:00]  He reads the taint, Opie, like you.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  People are saying, like, how long before there's just a circle jerk?  WWF circle jerk.  Mikey, what's going on?  Eat the cracker.  Eat the cracker.  What's up, Mike?  How you guys doing?  We're having fun.  I don't know if this makes sense today, but who the F cares?  I'm decent, but speaking about the yellow discipline. 
[01:24:30]  Wait, did he?  Hold on.  You can't put it that way, either.  They're going to dump out of that.  Oh, my bad, boys.  We'll get it on the radio.  Regal gave the big show some yellow discipline?  Yes, he administered the yellow discipline to the big show.  So they've done it already.  Silly me.  I thought that might have been a little too far, but I guess not.  Oh, brother.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  No problem, boys.  Bye.  Chip's got a great line.  Where are we going? 
[01:25:00]  Line eight.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, Chip.  Chip.  Yo, look what I kicked of me again.  Hold on.  I knew he'd screw it up.  Hang up on him.  Hold on.  I don't care now.  People don't know how to put it in terms.  He goes, Chip had a great line, but he said it the wrong way, and we had to take it out.  He was asking Norton if when he does that to himself and finishes, do you say to yourself, 
[01:25:30]  look what I did to you again.  Okay, cool.  Roxanne.  Yes.  What's up, Roxanne?  Nothing.  Okay.  Okay, great.  Well, you called the radio show, right?  And you're on the air right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, what do you want?  Well, I want to win the tickets.  The Britney Spears tickets?  Sure.  Oh.  All right, where are you calling from?  Cleveland.  You got to come down to New York. 
[01:26:00]  You going to fly me?  No.  Well, damn.  Thank you, Roxanne.  Thanks.  You think you are the CEO of Exxon?  Why would they fly you in?  Yeah, we're going to fly you in.  I don't know.  So you can participate in a contest.  You happen to be in New York and you're a mommy and you want to win Britney Spears tickets?  Great.  We'd love to have you Friday.  Yeah.  But this contest is for tickets in New York.  Yeah, so then you're going to have to come back to see Britney.  So someone in Philly or New York or Boston, maybe even some people in Washington will come up. 
[01:26:30]  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  We're just looking for mommies that want to do something very outrageous that would win the tickets to you to give to your daughter or maybe your young son even to go to Britney Spears.  And so far we've got one lady coming down Friday.  Right.  And honestly, what she's going to do is pretty lame.  But we've got to start somewhere.  We've got to start somewhere.  We've got to set the bar.  She's a 19-year-old mom with a 4-year-old kid.  Yeah, do the math. 
[01:27:00]  We did it earlier.  14, she got pregnant.  And she's going to come in and suck Stalker Patty's hammer toes.  Her hammer toes with those big yellow claw-like talons on her.  The toes are really disgusting.  Yeah.  But I don't know if that's going to get the job done.  I mean, the nails are really long because she can't clip them because they're too sensitive.  If she let Patty take that disgusting big toe and put it somewhere else, that would be cool.  We got a winner?  Yeah, that would be very close to a winning. 
[01:27:30]  She might actually do that.  I think I'd rather see Vince McMahon get his ass whipped.  Get his ass kissed.  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  There you have it.  A sound bite from a billionaire.  And the people were just shocked watching.  Did you see the audience?  Yeah, they were like, what the ass?  They were just shocked.  He lost his mind.  He lost his freaking mind.  And how does...  Screw talking to Shane.  I want to talk to Stephanie.  How she's got a look at her father's ass on WWF, on television. 
[01:28:00]  Not a blemish on it.  You know what it was like any time you'd get that disgusting sneak peek of any covered part of your parent?  Well...  Oh, Norton, stop it.  I remember being at the Bronx Zoo and I snuck a peek at my dad's unit when we were both in the urinals out of curiosity.  And I went, what the F happened to me?  But then again, I was only 13 at the time, so...  You snuck a peek at 13? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, I was curious.  I remember one time...  Ugh.  That's cool when you're five.  When you're 13, that's a little...  Dad's right next to you, like, whoa, what am I going to grow up to be?  I was curious.  Oh, man.  This is the blueprint right here.  Oh, 13.  You should not be seeing your dad's junk.  Well, mine wasn't going anywhere.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  What?  Hold on, because they're going to call me out on this one.  Let me explain a little further.  13, nothing's going on yet.  The puberty and the opster didn't happen. 
[01:29:00]  What type of...  My puberty, you know, happened really late.  So, at 13, I'm hung like an acorn.  And I'm at the Bronx Zoo, and Pop's right there.  I was starting to worry, because I'm starting to get the feelings for the girls and stuff.  I'm like, but there's nothing I can do with this thing.  So, I'm like, you know, look, there he is.  I'm half of him.  Let's see what I got to look forward to.  Oh, wait a minute.  We got some audio of Opie on that day.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[01:29:30]  One time, when I was a kid...  Hold on.  Am I out of the clear here?  Yeah, you're okay.  Sort of, right?  That's all right.  I was a little...  Come on, Norton.  Take a peek over at your pop's junk.  I never did.  I probably didn't know when I was five.  You guys are a bunch of pusses.  You're not willing to admit crap.  Of course, you got to look.  Yours hasn't developed yet.  You're wondering what it's going to become, of course.  I don't...  I'm so sick.  I'm in the bathroom at the zoo.  Hold on.  Where's all going?  Oh, no, you... 
[01:30:00]  Oh, my God.  I love that.  Here's a guy sneaking a peek from the stall.  Virgin.  Yeah, you're okay.  Stop.  Ooh.  Hey, where's my new sound?  I need it for this one.  That's funny.  Oh, my old piece of dad's audio. 
[01:30:30]  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Oh, boy.  Did you test it for its weight?  I'm girthed.  Shut up!  Test it for...  Penises!  Test it for endurance? 
[01:31:00]  And right as it happened.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  And then there's me next to him, Anthony.  I don't know.  Do you like having a background?  Was Hopi standing in a shopping bag.  Good time.  Buster Hyman.  That's very funny.  Crinkle, crinkle.  That's horrible. 
[01:31:30]  I woke up one Thanksgiving, right?  And I guess my mother wanted to get a...  You saw your mom's boobies?  No, no.  Early start on the Thanksgiving turkey.  I saw my mom's boobies.  Me, too.  Cut Shog Motor Inn.  Oh, my God.  That's sick.  A motor inn?  Motel, whatever.  A little seaside thing.  What, did you grow up in the set of Midnight Cowboy?  What is that?  She was bending over to tie the shoes of my younger brother, Quinn or Brett, there.  They were too young to tie their own shoes. 
[01:32:00]  I was 12.  She bent over and, wah, boobies.  Oh, man.  My mom let me watch...  When my sister was born, she was breastfeeding, so they thought it was good that I see that  like a natural thing.  No way.  What?  Now, see, that's twisted.  Wait, wait.  She said what?  That I could...  She breastfed my sister, and she said it was natural, and you could see it.  It wasn't dirty or anything.  So you took a look and...  Yes, and then I ran out of money, and the booth door closed. 
[01:32:30]  No, but that is true, though.  She let me watch that.  The curtain went down, and I needed another token.  Oh, man.  See, with my mom, it just happened to be there.  Wasn't supposed to happen, you know?  Dad!  All right, Ed, your story?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So I walk into the kitchen, and I was putting the turkey in the oven.  And she went through a lot of phases in her life.  She's in great shape right now, you know what I mean? 
[01:33:00]  She goes to the gym, very slim.  I can vouch for that.  But at the time, you know, I guess, you know, she was miserable, I guess.  She packed some pounds on.  So she was wearing this, I guess, what she slept in.  It's one of those very see-through things.  A see-through nightie with some panties.  And she's bent over the stove.  I look in.  All I see is my mom's wide ass right through all this see-through stuff. 
[01:33:30]  Butt crack, dimples, everything.  And I was horrified.  I was horrified.  And to this day, sometimes when I see a Thanksgiving turkey, I picture my mom's big ass.  It ruined Thanksgiving for me for years.  Did you get a little tent in your fitty pajamas, did you?  By Dr. Dentons?  No, it was so non-sexual.  It was so non-hot. 
[01:34:00]  It was just, oh, now I've got to scrub that image from my head.  I mean.  You get those sneak peeks, and it's just awful.  And they creep in when you're, you know, taking care of yourself.  That image will just creep in.  No.  Oh, God.  I'm not in on that one.  No, it spoils it.  Never, never, never.  No Paul from Lawrence.  It wasn't this past Thursday.  Dick. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  I was hoping in a shopping bag.  I'm still giggling.  Crinkle.  Crinkle.  Crinkle.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  And you tongue kissed your grandma.  Well, that was sort of, I guess.  You ever hear that one, Norton?  No.  Get this.  This is twisted, man.  Opie, it was during a holiday, I guess.  No, I just.  You went to kiss grandma. 
[01:35:00]  Like, hello.  You know how you see grandma and go, hi, grandma.  How are you?  My mouth just happened to be open.  And he opened mouth.  He went to go for the open mouth kiss.  I know.  And grandma pulled away.  And what'd she say?  Close your mouth.  But you're getting the story wrong.  That's what the story has become.  It was.  What was.  It was much more innocent than that.  I was just kidding.  Why did you open your mouth?  I don't know.  See, that's the sick part.  I can understand you're an innocent kid and stuff.  I was young and little and, you know. 
[01:35:30]  And you just thought people kissed with open mouths and they're kissing their grandma.  Well, do you guys sit down and watch the Blue Lagoon together?  Man, we got to start talking about something else and no one's going to hang out with us ever.  That's hysterical.  Look, this is beyond gay.  All right.  Use it or lose it.  That's right.  Okay.  After break, can we talk to more mommies?  Yes.  We want mommies.  We're running out of time.  Mommies, what would you do for the Britney Spears ticket?

[01:38:00]  Leanne, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Um, this is so disgusting.  My mother, like, when I hit about 14 years old, she just started walking around the house  naked.  Oh.  That is...  Why is that hot?  I don't...  That's hot now.  No, it's...  No, no, no.  You've got to understand.  Okay, when she...  I'm 22 now.  When she married my dad, had me two years later.  She was, like, 98 pounds.  She's got to be up to pushing 180, 190. 
[01:38:30]  Right now.  Who started walking around naked?  Huh?  Who started walking around naked?  My mother.  Ooh.  My mother.  It was like she would take a shower, and then sometimes she would come out wearing  just, like, a T-shirt, and that's it.  Like a short T-shirt.  But then sometimes she would just, you know...  That's kind of hot.  You know, come out of the shower.  No, it's not.  That's nasty.  Get her down here to win the Britney Spears tickets.  No way.  Mommy walks around naked in front of you. 
[01:39:00]  No way.  All right.  That's gross.  Do you think she wanted you to look?  I don't know.  I, to be honest with you, I have no clue.  All right.  No idea.  Thank you, Leanne.  No problem.  Have a good night, guys.  You too.  We could add something to the Johnny interns screwing up a bit.  Well, you know, I'm kind of having a problem with this cold, right?  And I needed some DayQuil for right now, because I'm starting to back up, and I needed some 
[01:39:30]  NyQuil for tonight.  When I go home, I take some NyQuil, and I'm out like a light.  Well, I'm not even going to say anything.  I will show you exactly what he got me, and you tell me why it is a problem.  Vicks.  That's not what he wanted.  No, no.  Why?  Because it's...  Look.  The DayQuil's fine.  I'll take the liquid caps.  But half the fun of NyQuil is doing the shot. 
[01:40:00]  So you need the liquid.  Right?  Am I crazy?  Oh, man.  Oh, but you're not a drinker.  Shut up.  Ben understands.  Oh, I do.  You're stretching, though, man.  No, you got the same effect.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  You need to drink that.  You pop the pills.  No.  Without the bad aftertaste.  No, you need that.  A, B, C, D.  Not A, B, D.  Wow, I think you're being a little picky.  Me?  Just mix it with some alcohol. 
[01:40:30]  You'll be fine.  No, see, the thing is, you need the drink.  Pop the pills with a little vodka.  It gets in your system faster, first of all, than the liquid caps.  All right.  We got to move on.  We got a very important person on the hotline.  Go get the drink.  Chyna!  Hi there.  How are you?  Good.  How are you, fellas?  Here she is.  It's Joanie.  Joanie?  Yeah.  I like that. 
[01:41:00]  Can you use Chyna anymore?  No.  You can't.  Nor do I want to.  No?  Well, you know, I'm excited about being Chyna.  You know, it was great.  Wonderful part of my life.  But it feels so good to be called by my name.  Honestly.  Do a lot of people still call you Chyna, though, on the street, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  I mean, for six years, they saw that on TV, you know?  Yeah.  But it doesn't bother me.  I mean, I'm grateful that they recognize me and love me and want to see me.  So who cares what they call me as long as they want to see me, right?  There you go.  I'll go with that. 
[01:41:30]  Before we move on to, like, what you're doing nowadays, why did you leave the WWF?  I mean, you were huger than huge.  I know.  I was.  And I actually, you know, had no intentions of leaving at first, but I came upon another five-year contract.  Yeah.  And I just felt like I was going backwards.  And, you know, I wasn't allowed to fight the guys anymore, first of all.  And that's what Chyna did.  She kicked ass, you know?  Why couldn't you fight the guys?  So I thought, right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Why couldn't you fight the guys anymore?  I think that it just, you know, it just grew. 
[01:42:00]  It just changed.  And I wasn't going to be world champion.  Vince told me I would never be world champion.  And, you know, actually, I don't think I could be because it's just, it wouldn't have been credible.  I mean, what am I going to do, fight Rocky and Steve?  You know, it wouldn't work.  And so, you know, I could fight the women, but there really wasn't any women for me to fight.  I mean, they're doing turkey bowl gravy matches, you know.  Let's be honest, the women were scared of you, Chyna.  You're a little bigger than the lipstick ladies they have in the WWF.  No, but listen, I mean, it's just that that was my M.O. 
[01:42:30]  And, you know, it's just time to move on.  And what I want to do now is just do, you know, do that same kind of kick-ass entertainment,  but do it in a different format, you know, do it in movies and television.  So you didn't want to kiss Vince's butt like everyone else is doing?  No, I don't want to kiss Vince's butt.  You know, run and kiss my ass.  That's right.  Listen, I worked hard, very hard for six years.  It was great.  It was wonderful.  It put me on the map. 
[01:43:00]  It gave me an opportunity.  And, you know, I did my job, and that's all I should have to do.  Now, you've got to think that there have been other people that have done this,  and it's kind of the odds are kind of against you a little bit of succeeding.  I hope you all the best.  But you look at...  Sable.  Sable was huge.  We hated her, by the way.  You want to see the grind?  Oh, was that awful.  Remember that?  Well, do her thing.  This is for all the women who want to be me and all the men who want to see me. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Is that you?  I thought you were her for a second.  Yeah, isn't that awful?  Oh, my God.  But then, you know...  What's the difference?  Well, I'll tell you what the difference is.  It's not whether I'm going to succeed, I'm succeeding.  And that's, like, the great part, because you're right.  Nobody's done it before.  Yeah.  So, you know, it's pretty exciting for me.  I'm doing all these appearances.  You know, I have my Playboy on my own two feet.  It says Joni Lauer on that front cover.  And, you know, I'm really super-duper proud of that. 
[01:44:00]  I don't care if a thing sells one copy.  It's me, and I'm really super proud of it.  Well, Opie's been hogging the issue.  He will not give it to me.  Chyna, I have to be honest, okay?  Okay.  And we asked a lot of the guys in the WWF what they thought about you in Playboy.  Guys love you.  They all loved you.  Now, one guy would say anything bad about you.  Well, I love them, too.  That's because they're my buddies.  And you know what?  I kind of have a problem with you naked in the Playboy, the first one and now the second one. 
[01:44:30]  What's the problem, Opie?  Tell me.  Tell me.  Talk to me.  Maybe you're a little too intimidating.  There's not much softness to your body.  There's a...  Let me see.  Look at the butt.  That's like a guy's butt.  It's amazing.  No, you're mistaken, okay?  No, it's an unusual butt for a woman.  I'll give you that.  It scares me there, Joni.  But it is not like a guy's butt, okay?  It's a strong, Amazonian, healthy woman's butt.  It's an athletic butt.  You're like an Amazon woman, yes.  You're damn straight. 
[01:45:00]  Look at these pictures.  I'll beat you up and you'll like it.  I know.  That's why...  Ow!  Oh, hey!  She's wild.  Look at that.  I knew it.  I don't even know if that made the radio there, Joni.  That was a very nice line.  Shaina, sporting the landing strip.  One of our favorite hairstyles there.  Is that what you call it?  The mohawk.  The mohawk.  I respect your discipline to get your body like that, but it scares me.  Our own Rick is into the muscle chicks.  Well...  The girls that have a little muscle.  I want it to scare you, though, because that's going to allow me to go out and be Terminator 
[01:45:30]  3 and the Wonder Woman 2000.  Oh, yeah?  You know what?  We're in a new millennium now.  You know what I mean?  So, it's that blend of strength and sexuality.  Are you going to be a Terminator?  I want to be.  Yeah?  That would be my next big goal.  You'd make a great Terminator.  See that?  All the guys would be going there to...  And that's what I love about the cover.  It's very, like, there's a lot of character, very strong characters in there, and, like, 
[01:46:00]  it's very fantasy and video game, and there's, you know, there is a lot of strength in there,  and I think that what they did was they made my muscles look beautiful, and the sets were,  like, very epic and strong but eloquent.  China, don't worry.  I mean, there's plenty of guys that are into it.  I'm just giving you my personal, you know, preference, and I'm...  I hope he doesn't like muscular girls.  Well, I like a little tone, but, you know, I understand the whole Amazon thing, and, yeah,  you look like a lot of the, you know, the chicks you find in video games and things like  that.  Sure. 
[01:46:30]  Sure.  Well, you know what?  Different strokes for different folks, right?  Right.  Without a doubt.  And, obviously, the last Playboy was the number one selling issue in the history of Playboy,  so some people out there must like it.  A lot of people liked it.  Don't, you know, don't take it personally.  I think you have one of the nicest Heinys I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Jim Norton loves your ass.  It's amazing.  Heine hype.  A lot of work goes into that, Heiney, okay?  Yeah, really, huh?  Hey, you're not shy at all, either.  No, I'm not shy.  You're not shy about showing everything there. 
[01:47:00]  Absolutely not.  Took a lot of work to get there.  I'm ready to show it.  Plus, I just think it's something very different, you know?  Yeah.  And I think it's important that we show that, you know, whether you like it or you don't,  you want to look at it.  And, you know, I thought about this.  I'm not like I'm trying to compare myself to a horse, and you'll see what I'm getting at.  I did the Hollywood Christmas Parade, which airs on December 1st.  Right.  And I rode in the Budweiser sleigh, and there were six Clydesdales that rode, that, you know, 
[01:47:30]  drug me along there in the parade.  They were the most amazing, beautiful creatures I've ever seen.  They were so big and muscular and sleek, but they walked with eloquence, and they were just,  they were incredible.  I've never seen anything like that.  So you are comparing yourself to a Clydesdale.  Yeah, okay.  Maybe I am.  Um, I like to be that, that female, um, Clydesdale of, of all women.  Hey, uh, Chyna, a lot of people ask you that.  Joni.  Joni, Joni, Joni.  Joni?  Please.  Joni, Opie. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Joni?  Joni.  That's me.  Hi, Joni.  Hi.  I thought we were talking to Chyna.  What happened?  Well, it's the same person, but.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's like Prince, formally known as, you know.  Right.  It's just the whole name thing.  Um, so a lot of people, uh, want us to ask you what happened to, uh, Triple H.  Okay.  Well, you know the story.  I know you know the story.  Not really, because.  And a lot of people know the story, too.  No, no, no, not really, because no one will give us a straight answer.  Okay, well, here's a straight answer.  We've asked all parties involved. 
[01:48:30]  He's, okay.  He's a putz.  He's damaged goods.  He was screwing the boss's daughter, and now he's history.  Gone.  Ouch.  We move on.  That's pretty good, though.  Moving on.  He's a putz.  Wow, you know what?  I have a lot more respect for you, Tony.  I like that.  Well.  I'm not even going to mess with you now, because I have respect for you, because I asked, uh,  some other people about it, and they didn't want to discuss it.  Well, yeah, it's always personal when you don't want to talk about it, right?  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't, uh, know they actually had hooked up like that. 
[01:49:00]  No, but, you know, the truth is, is that.  How'd you find out?  I found some letters, actually, that Stephanie had written.  I had suspected, you know, but I thought.  Oh, man.  No way would that, like, that, that ever be allowed to happen, because it's too much of it.  It's business, you know?  Yeah.  It's fixing business with pleasure, and Stephanie had a real chance to make it, you know, an  impression as a woman in a company like that, too.  And, um, I don't know.  She disappointed me, but it's not her fault.  Ultimately, it's Paul's fault, because he's the one who made the decision to do that,  and he was my boyfriend, you know?  So, um, you know. 
[01:49:30]  Wow, did you, you must have wanted to kick someone's ass, though.  Oh, I did, too.  Believe me.  But it's the boss's daughter.  Exactly.  Is there anything, uh, to do, uh, with that and you not being with the WWF anymore?  Well, hey, on paper, it all looks good.  It's business, and the truth is, they did offer me a contract.  They offered me a contract, and I did not accept.  Right.  In our heart, in my heart, I want to say, well, of course, you know, how can I go on  there every single day working?  You know, it hurts.  I'm a huge thing, you know?  But, you know, it, uh, things work out. 
[01:50:00]  Things worked out in the end.  It was, I think it was time all the way around for my career, and, you know, I think if I  would have signed that contract, you know, there's a lot of guys that aren't even working,  and they're sitting at home right now.  Yeah.  And so, you know, in retrospect, everything's worked out.  I don't have any bitter feelings.  I know that one day I'll walk through those doors again, but it'll be for a rest of  WrestleMania or some big show, and that'll make me happy, you know?  There you go.  And now I'm doing everything I want to do, and my fans are still really supportive of  me, and so, you know, hey, it's, it was a relationship. 
[01:50:30]  We move on.  It was six wonderfully, and like you said, I, I still talk to the guys all the time.  I see them when they're in L.A., and, you know.  All right, all right.  You've explained yourself.  So now you're in the, in the Playboy, and you're doing, uh, Celebrity Fear Factor, too,  right?  Playboy came out today.  Yep.  Um, Fear Factor tonight.  And then tomorrow, tomorrow, you may have heard that I'm hosting the Exotic Erotic Ball  at Webster Hall at eight o'clock.  Cool.  And that is going to be a wild, wild party. 
[01:51:00]  There, last night we did a media party at the Virgin Record Store, and people could come  in costume and win free tickets to this thing tomorrow night, and it was amazing, some of  the costumes that showed up.  I mean, and everything goes.  I don't know if you've heard about this, but last year at the Cow Palace.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  No, no, no.  I was Stone Cold.  Well, it could be sexy.  It's a matter of opinion.  15,000 people, you guys, showed up at the Cow Palace last year.  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:51:30]  Stone Cold.  Relax, Stone Cold.  Sorry.  Relax.  Relax.  Sorry, Joni.  That's okay.  So this is, uh, Terry Mann is the producer of this show, and they're taking it nationwide  now, all over the place.  Yeah.  On your knees.  Who is he talking to?  And kiss my ass!  Would you stop it?  I'm not doing that.  Opie, knock it off.  Are they there, you guys?  What happened?  Are they there?  Yeah.  You're just not telling me?  Yeah, that's what it is.  No, we wouldn't do that to you, would we? 
[01:52:00]  Hey, is it true you once benched 365 pounds?  It is true.  Holy.  For a single, and I almost got buried, but, um, you know, every day I was really going  for strength, and this is why I was with Paul, actually.  And, um, when we first started dating, we were going to the gym, and I think he kind  of felt a little intimidated, you know, and we started putting weight on the bench.  And I wanted to show off, too, and, like, all the guys started gathering.  Around the gym, and the more they were egging me on, you know, oh, that's really cool that 
[01:52:30]  she could do that, the more weight I wanted to lift.  And we kept going kind of back and forth, and I actually did 365 for a single.  365.  Never did it again in my life, but it was pretty darn impressive.  That intimidates me.  Do you have a sensitive side?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A little romance.  Listen.  And you're, no, no steroids or anything?  No, absolutely not, no.  None of that crap?  I don't need it.  No, nor do I want to look like that. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  Like, if people would do, and that's a common question, and I understand that because people  are really ignorant.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  I mean, ignorant as far as knowledge, that they don't understand, you know, that I've been  working out for many, many years, a conscious diet, a conscious dedication to, you know, physical  activity.  And plus, it was my job for many years to be bigger and stronger.  And so, I trained that way.  Yeah.  And, you know, it took years to develop my body like that.  But most people, you obviously see that steroids is a quick way out. 
[01:53:30]  It's not attractive looking.  It changes your skin, your physique, your shape, your face, everything.  So, you know, I've been very conscious to try and be modern and strong, but still display  a very feminine shape.  Right.  And it's funny, when you see me in person, I think, you know, most people, the hype that  TV makes you look bigger and the attitude and never smiling.  Remember!  People think I'm like a 300-pound gorilla, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Holy.  Well, China.  Hey, did you and Triple H just used to, like, now I can just picture you guys doing it in  front of a mirror.  Like two horses.  Wow, look at this.  Look how muscular we are.  The bed's just breaking under you.  No, well, we did it in front of mirrors a couple times.  You did?  Let's look at ourselves.  Look how good we look.  But, you know what?  I'll tell you what's it.  You think?  I got spoiled with all those big, beautiful men, though.  Because when I did walk around with any of them, it was like freaking a power couple,  a genetic wonder freaking heading towards people. 
[01:54:30]  It was like the parting of the Red Sea when we'd go anywhere, you know?  Right.  Because they really have amazing, all of the wrestlers have really amazing bodies.  Amazing physique.  Where's Kreskin when we need them?  Why?  I think Kreskin should be on the show.  Why?  Where's Kreskin?  Sorry, Joni.  Just for talking about something.  All right.  Joni?  Yes?  Best of luck to you.  Well, thank you.  I wish you guys would come to the Exotic Erotic Ball tomorrow night.  Oh, there you go.  We don't want to get hurt. 
[01:55:00]  The Exotic Erotic Ball.  Oh, you might get hurt, but you might like it.  Hey, do you think Steffi looks hot with her new boob job?  I'm not going to give her props.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  I can't even watch right now.  Yeah.  You know?  It's almost like watching some other chick doing your...  Oh.  You know, it's so...  I'm past it.  I'm done.  Are you?  Yeah.  On to bigger fish to fry, you know?  Good thing.  All right.  Joni, a.k.a.  China, in the latest issue of Playboy that came out today. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  Norton thinks you're really hot.  I'm a little scared of you.  And Anthony?  I think it's very nice.  Yes.  I like it.  You look very statuesque.  Because you could smother a fella.  Like, I like that.  I could.  I could smother a fella.  Yes.  Not painfully, but just like a lot of...  There's a lot of women there, and it's all in great shape.  It's hot.  Right.  I could be gentle until somebody maybe takes me off or something, and then I put a little  bit more force into it, but...  And hopefully you'll be on the big screen, right?  I hope so.  Well, I have a movie coming out in the spring called Frank McCluskey. 
[01:56:00]  It's a comedy.  Do you play him?  And, um...  No, I do not play him.  Oh.  No, I thought...  No, there are girls named Frankie.  Stop it.  Oh, stop it.  You're just trying to antagonize me now.  No.  Cut that out.  Yeah, Anthony.  What's wrong with you?  You want to be smothered.  See?  Yeah.  He's trying to be a wise guy.  That's Jim Norton.  He's trying to say, like, oh, you scare me, you scare me, but he really wants me to  scare him.  It's Jim Norton.  Well, that's pretty brave.  Make fun of her voice or something, Anthony.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't say anything.  Hey, let me tell you something. 
[01:56:30]  I hate my own voice.  That's okay.  But it's a voice that people recognize through the drive-thru, okay?  Absolutely.  You probably get free stuff with that voice, right?  And it's mine.  And I've been punched in the throat about a hundred times, so leave my voice alone.  Yeah, leave her voice alone, Anthony.  Can I ask you a question?  Norton.  Who else is starring in Frank McCluskey?  Randy Quaid.  Oh.  Dolly Parton's in it.  David Sheridan.  A lot of cameos.  Scott Baio.  It's really funny.  Is it being released directly onto video?  No.  Oh.  That's one of the viewers? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  I've heard of it.  Yeah, it's going to be a big hit there.  It's not one of the movies you've been in, Norton.  Yeah.  Hey, don't start with me because I'm aware of the whole XFL pre-show that you guys did, okay?  All right.  One of the lowest rated shows in the history of television, okay?  Don't talk to me about going straight to video, bucko.  Joanie has won.  Again, won unanimously.  Oh, my God.  Come on. 
[01:57:30]  Give me another one.  You want to start with me, buddy?  No.  Okay.  Why do you think we're doing this interview on the phone?  Exactly.  We were scared of you.  You beat us up.  All right.  China, thank you.  Joanie.  You're welcome.  I mean, yeah, but you've got to say China so the people go and get the playboy.  That's right.  Let Vince sue you.  They might be thinking we're talking to...  You call me whatever.  Let him sue you.  Right.  Let him sue everybody.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay, listen.  So you can also log on to bodybyjoanie.com.  Oh. 
[01:58:00]  For all of the crazy, kooky information.  Okay?  Body by Johnny?  Body by Joanie.  Oh, Joanie.  Joanie.  Joanie, everyone.  Anthony.  I'm sorry, Joanie.  You are not.  I am sorry.  I thought it was like a body by Jake.  I didn't know.  Well, it's kind of like a body by Jake.  Body by Joanie, though.  Body by Joanie.  Yeah.  It's catchy.  Catchy, yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm losing my hearing.  You guys are, like, quiet tonight, I think.  Yeah.  Are you, like...  I don't know.  We're a little under the weather.  I got a cold. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, Anthony's sick.  I know.  All right.  Joanie, thank you so much.  Joanie, thank you.  Okay.  Well, thank you guys.  And thanks for being honest with us.  We definitely appreciate that.  Oh.  All right?  Least I could do.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, are you going to watch Fear Factor tonight?  Of course.  Of course.  It's really cool.  Actually, he's getting good reviews in the paper, so I'll check it out.  All right.  All right.  Okay, you guys.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  We can never have her in here. 
[01:59:00]  We can never have her in here because...  There's a lot of chicks named Frankie.  That could be the worst cover I've ever heard in my life.  I have to do something.  One stupid film with Michelle Pfeiffer.  Frank.  You act like it's every other chick.  You know, we got to be honest with our listeners.  China was supposed to be in studio, and quite frankly, we were scared to have her in here.  We completely pussyed out.  So, call us the pussies, whatever you have to, but that is the truth.  We're like, oh, we can mess with her on the phone.  Yeah.  That's the type of guys and men we are. 
[01:59:30]  Pussas.  She gained a lot of respect, though, when she gave us the dirt, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That's nice.  That's good.  That's when I put the brakes on.  Triple H was banging Stephanie.  That's what she says, Anthony.  After they were, well, that's her story.  We have asked Triple H.  We have asked Stephanie.  Now we've asked China.  Well, you know, it might be that, I don't know, it would seem that you would get a crappy  contract put in front of you if they want to get rid of you if the owner's daughter is 
[02:00:00]  now banging your boyfriend.  How much does it suck that you get, I don't know.  West Coast Dave, China has set the new record for most plugs per babble.  Yeah, she was plugging three different things there, wasn't she?  All right.  I'm still proud of the XFL pregame show.  Oh, God. 
[02:00:30]  What did you call her?  Johnny?  No, I thought you said Buddy by Johnny.  Buddy by Johnny.  You're awful, man.  I was holding you down the river, too.  I know.  We're all, I was like blaming Norton for stuff.  With the voice thing.  Yeah.  Don't even mention her voice at that point.  We can't believe you're making fun of her voice, Anthony.  I didn't say anything.  No one said anything at that point.  You suck.  All right, well.  Joanie, there she is.  Yeah, check her out in Playboy, okay? 
[02:01:00]  All right.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Our new fall lineup is Sports Guys Morning, John and Mike, Middays, Moppy and Anthony Afternoons,  Ron and Fez, Nights.  We are 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.

So drink the Sam Adams and go to projectgreenlight.com and submit your idea.  It's Project Greenlight and Sam Adams.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, 1027 WNEW.  Lou, what's going on?  Hey, I thought we're not going to do has-been corner anymore ever since Cindy Williams. 
[02:02:30]  Uh, ah, China was a good sport.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't as painful as Cindy Williams, but it was painful.  There were some uncomfortable moments in there, my friend.  Take care, guys.  All right, Lou.  Just checked out Body by Joni.  Uh, this is Mitch.  She's doing nothing but car show appearances.  It's downhill.  Uh-oh.  Well, she is in Playboy.  You can do see her pop up occasionally on some TV shows. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  All right.  Guys, you want to answer somebody's question who wrote in on instant feedback and asked  if we could send a camel toe video?  Camel toe video, yeah.  To the station.  To the station.  Norton needs that.  Oh, I love camel toe.  You love the camel toe?  Oh, God, it's great.  I really do.  I want it to look like two boxing gloves.  All right.  Boxing gloves. 
[02:03:30]  Whatever works for you, Norton.  Pack of Franks.  All right, we got to get back to the mommies.  We need to get our mommies in line for Friday's show, Anthony.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Right.  Great tickets to the show at the Garden.  We're going to throw a limo into the whole thing.  We got some spending money and free dinner.  Yeah, this is your chance, mommies, to, you know, get back in your kid's good graces.  Your kid wants to see Britney. 
[02:04:00]  Here's your shot.  And these are great tickets.  If it's a girl, she's going to go there and know exactly what Britney was wearing and be  able to buy the clothes.  If it's a boy, he's going to be close enough to put it in his spank bubble and remember  it as he cranks it for years to come.  That's okay.  I just have so much mucus pouring into myself.  It's disgusting.  I can't help it.  I can't even concentrate at this point.  I just took some more DayQuil. 
[02:04:30]  It's funny because you're never sick.  I am never sick.  This sucks.  It's the Thrax.  I know it.  It's not the Thrax because you got the runny nose.  I told you that already.  I got the new runny nose Thrax that they put out.  Hey, is it true that Jimmy Carter had hemorrhoids?  What?  Did you read it in the Daily News today?  Why would they even print that?  Give me the Daily News.  Page 32 there, please.  That Jimmy Carter, our former president, had hemorrhoids as he was doing that little thing 
[02:05:00]  with Sadat and all that.  I'm distracted.  Gay Randy, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  What have you been up to?  Not much.  You were the one that wanted a date with Marco, I believe, right?  That's right.  More recently, I'm the guy who kissed Al Duke.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right, right.  And thus...  Thus causing the foosball table of death.  Destroyed the foosball table.  That's right.  Um, you know, in the tradition of gay Marco, I want to enter this contest this Friday. 
[02:05:30]  But you're not a mommy.  I'm not.  Oh, I take my guy to the concert.  Your guy.  What, are you just going to laugh at what a terrible, ugly bitch she is?  She's really not that good.  Well, we know she's not a talent, but she's hot.  Well, humor us.  No, she is hot.  Humor us.  What would you do for the Britney Spears tickets, even though you're not a mommy?  I, um, well, I can do what you guys were talking about before.  I can, um, do auto-eroticism.  You can give yourself, uh, treats?  That's right. 
[02:06:00]  About three quarters of the way.  Are you packing or just flexible?  Three...  I'm both.  Three quarters of the way.  Three quarters of the way?  Yeah, I can't, I can't get down to, um...  Right.  I can't get down to the forest, but, um, I can get halfway through it.  Three quarters of the way through it.  Oh, my God.  I mean, what's my competition so far?  What's this one mother, what can she do?  I can see, you know, you're, you're almost there, and you, yeah, yeah, yeah, you stick  your tongue out as far as you can, but... 
[02:06:30]  Quitter.  How, uh, how old were you when you learned that you had this talent?  How old was I?  Yeah.  24.  Really?  You'd think you would learn before that.  Yeah, you'd think you could actually do that.  Some uncle or neighbor would have pointed it out.  And you could do this tonight, tomorrow, whatever.  Um, yeah.  How old are you?  25.  But you just started doing it last year?  I, I only did it on a dare, but I've been doing it ever since.  Being a gay guy, I figured you'd try to figure it out sooner. 
[02:07:00]  No, no, you know, that's where you guys, you know, that's where I was a little upset  before, you know, because I'm gay doesn't mean we go around sucking our own C's or, or,  you know, me wanting to whip up a clone so I can do it, you know?  What?  You know, it's not like doing, like, secret scientists and stuff, you know, it's just.  Hey, Randy, it's simple as this, man.  If I was, uh, if I was a woman, I would have, I would never leave the house.  So you're a gay guy, you're into guys, and you could do that to yourself.  Why are you leaving the house?  I'd much rather have someone else do it. 
[02:07:30]  So I get the full, the full force.  The full force.  I get the, I get the full, the full hog.  Hey, do you think, do you think you're good?  Actually, you know what?  I have a, I, no, honestly, I have a bad gag reflex.  All right, listen, man.  Too much freaking information.  I do.  I have a bad gag reflex.  Someone has to put their foot down.  This, this show is too gay.  It's been a very gay show today.  Let's get back on the hetero track.  Yeah.  The hetero track is this way.  We're off track a little bit. 
[02:08:00]  Well, maybe one day we'll have you come in and show off that talent for a bunch of girls.  You know, with how the girls say we never give them anything?  Uh-huh.  And, uh, we've had the, the penis puppeteers come in and whatnot.  Maybe you could be saved for one of those days.  I'm putting my foot down.  Sean, I'm speaking for everyone.  If ONA watched this in studio, I will never listen again.  You know what?  I don't blame Sean.  Okay.  This will never happen.  So, but it was okay for Marco to do it to a girl for NSYNC tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was, yeah, yes. 
[02:08:30]  This comedy, this comedy and a gay guy giving oral treats to a female.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, but.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  But I could definitely, I could definitely win.  What can I tell you?  Double standards, man.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  You should ask China if she could suck her own C.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, Randy, thank you so much, but we're going to have to pass on that.  Okay, guys.  Well, um, I don't know.  I don't think you can find a mommy who can do something quite like that.  Well, whatever.  We'll try.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:09:00]  Okay, Anthony, yeah, here's the Jimmy Carter story.  All right.  More talking about a man's butt.  Great.  Take us out of that gate.  Good thing you put your foot down.  Jimmy Carter is revealing more than he probably should about some personal physical trauma  during his search for a Mideast peace agreement.  In his latest book, Christmas in Plains, the former president recalls the agony he was forced to endure from hemorrhoids  while negotiating with the Egyptian president, Anwar Siddharth, eating his peanuts. 
[02:09:30]  Learning of his discomfort, Sadat asked his own nation to pray for an end to Carter's torment.  Miraculously, the day after Christmas, for the first time in weeks, all the pain and discomfort went away, writes Carter.  I've never received a better Christmas gift in all my life.  Through prayer?  Through prayer, yeah.  Anwar Siddharth had most of his nation praying for Jimmy Carter's hemorrhoids.  How did he do that?  He told Siddharth, I have hemorrhoids.  Have your nation pray for me.  And they did. 
[02:10:00]  And the day after Christmas, they were gone.  And it was the best present he ever got.  And Siddharth wound up getting shot.  Maybe he should have prayed for himself more than Carter's hemorrhoids.  Maybe what some guy learned what he was actually praying for, he had to kill him.  It was for world peace.  He realized it's for some hillbilly's ass to heal.  Krista, what's going on?  Oh, that's so sick.  The whole show is sick today.  Anyway, I have a little project here. 
[02:10:30]  I created an extension on the Tell Me phone site.  I learned VXML.  And so it's going to have your bits of the week.  What?  What?  Okay.  You know the Tell Me, the 800 number that you've advertised?  Tell Me, yeah.  Okay.  There's a feature on there called Extensions.  Uh-huh.  And you can create a phone.  Uncle John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Guys, listen to what you say.  It's making me realize that I have a gag reflex. 
[02:11:00]  Huh?  You're making me sick, man.  I know.  It's enough to make you puke.  Some of this stuff's pretty funny today.  Oh, man.  This is nasty.  But anyway, I've got to ask you one question.  Yes.  Seeing your mom's boobs at age 12 drove you to look at your dad's junk at 13?  Later, guys.  Very good.  A lot of the day right there.  Let's see China's little list here.  Auto Parts Autorama.  Extreme Monster Truck Nationals. 
[02:11:30]  Washington Area New Automobile Dealers Association.  Annual World of Wheels.  Gibraltar Trade Show.  Car Quest World of Wheels in Wisconsin State Fair Park.  Man, Vince always gets the last laugh.  Is she appearing at any venue that doesn't encourage incest?  Vince will always get the last laugh.  I'm sure she pulls in a nice chunk of change for doing these. 
[02:12:00]  But my God, if you're at the 43rd annual Car Quest 500 World of Wheels from the Indianapolis State Fairgrounds.  Ouch.  But she's going to make it, Anthony.  She said she's already making it.  There you go.  On her own there.  Scott, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, I'm just wondering why we didn't have Tom Brokaw do the Jimmy Carter thing with the hemorrhoids.  Why didn't he break the story?  Well, let's go to the music and see if there's anything there at all, Scott.  Okay. 
[02:12:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm a bit under the weather today.  What a coincidence.  Anthony's under the weather as well, Mr. Brokaw.  Have a cold.  You know, I was just on the phone with former President Ronald Reagan, and it seems he has a cold, too.  Is that why he's not calling the show?  Yeah, he will not be calling. 
[02:13:00]  No.  I'm thinking I'm going to go home about 9.15 and get a tall glass of NyQuil, not those asinine liquid caps like John got me, Anthony.  But once you've taken the little shot glass that is applied, this is agony. 
[02:13:30]  Look at my eyes.  Looks like you were smoking some weed, Mr. Brokaw.  Smoke the weed.  I love it.  Smoke weed every day.  Your eyes are swollen.  They're a little red.  They're running.  I was just in the stairwell at Club Stinky.  Club Stinky?  Which is a fabulous place, a great venue for smoking marijuana.  And my eyes were a little red from that.  And then I took some cold medication.  So I'm pretty f***ed up right now. 
[02:14:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  So you have no comments on the Jimmy Carter thing?  Who the f*** cares about Jimmy Carter?  Well, he has hemorrhoids.  I don't care.  I have a cold.  All right.  I can't even talk anymore.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  John, what's going on?  Coming up next to NBC Nightly News, if you give oral treats, your clone, does that make you gay?  Tune in tonight as I steal ratings from Dan Rather. 
[02:14:30]  If I give Dan Rather oral treats, does that make us gay if we're doing it for purely rating?  Tune in and find out.  As I suck Dan Rather's f*** for rating.  As you see, I do.  All right.  There he is.  Tom Brokaw.  John, what's going on?  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Just on Dan.  Hey, I agree.  You're getting too gay, so I've got a story to pull you out of it.  Okay.  When I was seven or eight years old, I saw my grandmother full frontal nudity, and it was great fun. 
[02:15:00]  Your grandma?  Yeah.  You saw your grandma fully naked?  Oh, yeah.  How did that come about?  I went towards their room.  There's my grandfather sitting in the chair there.  I said, there's grandma here, and he kind of points to this part of the room, so I peeked my head in, and there she's standing buck-ass naked.  How'd it look?  It was nasty.  I mean, how was my grandmother?  Oh, man.  Not only is it old lady body, which is just horrendous, but it's your grandma.  Exactly.  You shared DNA. 
[02:15:30]  Ugh.  Ugh.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  Your mom came out of that place you looked at.  All right, all right, all right.  Oh, God.  Stalker Patty, what's up?  Hi.  What's this about Friday?  I tuned in late because I got out of work late.  What do you mean?  You said something.  I love that.  Hammer-toed loser.  Those disgusting feet.  Like, you would think someone like Patty, who is just horrid, might take her shoes off, and you'd go, wow, you know, she's really gruesome, but her feet are kind of attractive. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Something, some redeeming quality.  She takes her shoes off.  I got him a toe.  I got him a toe.  Well, Patty, why don't you clip those disgusting, big, yellow, looks like coral on your toes, toenails.  Oh, it hurts a lot. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, my God.  It hurts when I clip them, so I just let them grow.  And they're growing.  And her toe.  They're curling underneath.  They're curling underneath.  Her hammer toe makes her toe hang, like her toe on her right foot hangs a hard right and goes right into her next toe over.  So her big toenail, a disgusting Dorito corn chip toenail, is digging into that other thing.  And you're like, she's disgusting, literally head to toe.  Literally disgusting head to toe.  Know what her feet look like? 
[02:17:00]  What?  You know, like those shoes that they wear in, like, the Middle East.  Oh, the ones that curl up?  Curl up and stuff?  Those clown-like shoes?  Disgusting.  It's like one of those.  Like the Iron Sheik, yeah.  Yeah.  What he used to wrestle in, those little curly, curly fry type shoe things.  Make patty feet at home, okay?  Put your foot in a vice and smash it with a hammer at your toe.  And then get some crazy glue and glue on corn chips on your toes.  And they'll look just like patty's feet. 
[02:17:30]  Swear to God.  Try it at home.  Oh, is she hobbled?  It looks like it.  Take a pipe wrench to your big toe.  Do it now.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.  Get a pipe wrench.  Okay.  Now, grab it in the jaws and pull it over so it just cracks, snaps, and it faces right.  Do that.  Okay?  Great.  Drew, what are you whispering?  As I walk away from the snack machine dejectedly, thank you very much.  What's up, Drew? 
[02:18:00]  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, this is more for Jim Norton.  A little while ago, when you made the comment about watching them fall down and reinjure  themselves, I take care of a group of seniors at a nursing home not too far away from where  I live.  What a fun job that must be.  I'm sorry?  What a fun job that must be.  Well, let me tell you something.  It's going to get gross along with the line of gross stories that are going on today.  There's a bunch of guys.  They sit in their own little playing card circle.  They call Jim Norton Ed Norton.  They laugh like hell whenever he says a word out of his mouth. 
[02:18:30]  They want to know when he's going to write a book.  A little while ago, they start laughing, and they're all laughing in a group.  The next thing you know, you just hear the laughter kind of stop.  All right?  The laughter kind of stops.  This guy is laughing so hard at you, Jim, he blew his colostomy bag right off of his  stomach.  Come on, man.  You're lying.  No, I'm not.  No, I am not.  You just made him near, if that's true.  I work in New York.  I'll come and tell you the story myself.  Oh, you're telling us on the phone.  He blew his colostomy bag off? 
[02:19:00]  He blew his colostomy bag off.  He was, you know, some people hold their bellies when they laugh.  He laughed.  He went down with his arms, and off it came.  I know, because I had to help him clean it up.  That could be the greatest compliment I've ever been paid in 12 years of doing comedy.  That is great.  I'm glad I could help, because these guys, they do not miss a day.  Well, let's get them on the phone.  Well, that'd be great.  How about tomorrow?  Or help.  Dude, if you can make this work.  Are you near them now?  No, actually, I am home.  All right, yeah, call us tomorrow.  Hold on, we'll get a number from you. 
[02:19:30]  Great.  I would love to get these old guys on the line.  Outstanding.  They love the Tom Brokaw.  They love Tom Brokaw.  Yeah, did you say you got something out of a snack machine?  Well, no, he was making the comments about that.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, sir.  He grew in the corn chips, and I was, like, looking at a bag, and I'm like, oh, forget that.  Drew, you were talking about, I said, why were you whispering?  You were talking about some kind of snack machine that was in front of you.  Walking away from the snack machine.  Yeah, at your house, you have a snack machine? 
[02:20:00]  No, actually, I'm right down the street.  Oh, my God, your story's falling apart.  Wow.  Why is it falling apart?  Wow, you just said you were home.  I said you were home.  He might be figured it in.  I'm right down the street.  I'm sorry.  It's been a long day, too.  Hold on, hold on.  Are you home or not?  I'm home now.  No, you're not.  No, you're not, because you just said you were next to him.  You want me to give you my phone number?  You are such a compulsive liar.  Whatever.  You want to call me back? 
[02:20:30]  You're worse than Kreskin.  Your story has a lot of holes in it right now.  You were talking about being in front of a snack machine.  What happened to the snack machine?  I love when they get caught.  Ben, who picked that up?  Ben?  Yeah.  Very good, Ben.  We don't like fake stories on the show, bro.  It's not fake stories.  Oh, my God.  I'm down the street.  I walked back to my apartment, and now I'm a liar?  I believe you.  I don't believe you at all.  Let's just put it this way.  If you're for real, you'll have the old guys call the show tomorrow.  Not a problem.  I am saying... 
[02:21:00]  What do you need?  What I'm offering is, what do you need from me?  Oh, my...  You know what?  I'm cutting my losses.  Punch out, Maverick.  I'm punching out.  That guy was such a liar.  Damn it.  Oh, damn snack machine.  Stalker Patty.  Hi.  I don't like what you just said about me, okay?  It hurts my feelings.  I cannot help it if I have a condition on my foot that I can't correct myself.  It's really not funny to me.  Oh, she's crying. 
[02:21:30]  What?  But it's not fair.  Oh, Patty.  No!  Oh, Patty.  I'm sorry.  Patty.  You know, I take very good care of myself.  I'm not ugly.  Patty, it's okay.  I'm not a monster.  It's just your foot kind of looks like you stepped in front of a rototiller.  But, Anthony, you walk in pain every day of your life and see how you feel.  I've had to do that since I was a child, and I don't complain either.  Oh, poor the guilt on.  You're using your Catholic Church upbringing.  Oh, play that sad walking away song from The Incredible Hope. 
[02:22:00]  You know, it's not anything I've ever complained about.  I just think it's a part of my life, and that's it.  I live with it.  Patty, maybe if you describe a little bit of how it is to deal with that every day, I can understand.  Yeah, we can understand.  Go ahead.  Well, whenever I try to clip my nails, it's painful.  I feel it.  Okay?  I'm only able to brush them in the shower.  That's it.  That's the only way.  You know, I keep my feet covered all the time.  They look white in the summertime.  The rest of me is tanned. 
[02:22:30]  You know, only because I keep them covered.  I'm actually ashamed of them.  That's why I very rarely wear sandals.  And what is it like to walk around?  Well, it's painful.  Yeah, we don't know about hammer toes.  Yeah.  Educate us.  It just hurts.  That's all.  My feet feel weird, and it just hurts.  But I walk long distances.  And what's it like mentally to deal with this on a daily basis, Patty?  I just...  Do you dream of having normal feet where you can wear cute little sandals and polish your 
[02:23:00]  toes up and put a little nail polish on your toes, a little red nail polish?  That would be nice.  Yes.  You know, but the thing is, it's not reality.  I just keep my feet covered all the time.  Sneakers in the summer and, you know, whatever.  Comfort.  You know, only because I can't afford to correct them.  Hello?  Patty, and this is something you have to live with, right, Patty? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, every day.  Yeah, but I don't complain because I'm not a complainer.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I think she's enlightened us a little bit more.  Patty, you're special.  I just want to tell you that.  People might laugh at your toes and make fun of your feet, but God damn it, you're special.  I think your feet are pretty, yeah.  I would kill to see you jump rope.  Can you jump rope, Patty?  Sure, I've done that before, but I haven't done it in years. 
[02:24:00]  I did it when I was a kid.  With those feet, you can't jump straight up and down.  You kind of jump to the right a little bit, jump to the left.  No, I used to double-dutch when I was a kid.  I feel a pain.  I understand being a kid with a pejoria that, you know, I'm a nine-year-old.  I'm trapped in the body of an 85, 95-year-old man.  I have the aging disease.  I look like a little alien child.  But, you know, Patty just blows me away.  That story blew me away. 
[02:24:30]  You're special, Patty.  Don't let anybody tell you that your feet are ugly.  They're funny.  Well, let's let Patty have the final word.  Patty.  Right.  Sum it up, you know, what you're feeling.  Yeah.  No, I just had my feelings hurt.  You know, how disgusting and everything.  Why do you think I've never shown them?  I didn't mean to show them last week.  That was just an accident.  Well, they were pretty horrific.  Well, I mean, I know they're ugly feet. 
[02:25:00]  I'm aware of that.  But there's nothing much I could do about it.  Do you get out of the shower and sometimes for a short moment you feel good about yourself  and then you look down and you're reminded of the horror that is those ten toes,  those ten gnarled toes with the Doritos toenails on them?  Actually, I just don't pay attention to my feet.  You just don't look down, right, Patty? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Well, no, I don't look at them, no.  I just talcum-powdered them and took my socks on and that's it.  You're the type of girl that's always looking up.  Well, yeah.  I like to be optimistic.  Do you look at girls in the summer wearing the sandals and they paint their toes real nice?  Well, actually, I can look attractive in other ways.  Oh, yeah?  Well, you know, I find other things about myself.  Like what, Patty?  Well, I look young for my age.  I don't look my age. 
[02:26:00]  That's a plus.  I'm thin.  I'm not fat.  That's a plus.  All right.  I'll give her those.  You know, I take care of myself.  I take vitamins.  I eat vegetables, you know?  Mummies don't look their age and they're thin.  No, I'm not that old.  I'm not that old, Anthony.  Mummies don't look their age and they're thin.  A lot of people can't get past the fact that Patty said that she brushes her toes in the shower.  Yeah, Patty.  But that's the shower thing.  Give me your, give me, what do you do? 
[02:26:30]  You lift up your foot and you have a brush?  Well, yeah, because I get a lot of, I don't know what you call it, on the bottom of my feet.  Chronicles.  Like rough skin or whatever and it hurts.  So I have to, you know, but other than that, I can't really go, you know.  So you brush the bottom of your feet and your toenails?  Well, yeah.  Patty, what happens?  It's just normal, normal shower thing.  No, that's not normal.  Patty, you have to clip your toenails at some point, Patty. 
[02:27:00]  How do you do this?  Well, if they get too long, I try to clip them a little, but it's just painful and sometimes I have to stop because I'm sensitive on my feet.  Do you cry a little bit, Patty?  No.  Do you go?  As soon as it starts to hurt, I stop.  Do you like a, ow, that hurts.  Ow.  Your toenails are like in Dumb and Dumber when he was getting the pedicure.  Remember that? 
[02:27:30]  One time somebody gave me that as a birthday present a few years ago and it was so painful I almost passed out.  They gave me a pedicure for my birthday.  I gave you a pedicure and you went and it was like a torture chamber for you.  Well, it was fine when they were doing my nails in my hands.  That was okay.  And then when it got to my feet, I almost like, I just, it was all I could do to hold still and let the guy walk.  Imagine that poor son of a bitch that's like, oh, we do a great job on you. 
[02:28:00]  And then he gets there, he does your fingernails and everything's fine and then you take those feet off.  And what did he do when he saw his feet?  Did he jump back a little?  No, he just used a lot with the pumice stone.  Pumice stone?  Yeah.  Well, you used that on your feet anyway.  You're supposed to.  Uh, Patty.  Yeah?  Can we give you a pedicure live on the air? 
[02:28:30]  Sure, that would be nice, but it would be a little painful.  I would have to take a couple aspirin first.  A couple aspirin.  But I'll do it.  All right, we'll get her a painless pedicure.  Brad on line five says that stalker Patty sounds like Rosie from the Jetsons.  Sounds like what?  Rosie, the robot from the Jetsons.  Uh, uh, uh, okay, Mr. Jetson.  That's when Rosie was depressed.  Right.  Uh, uh, uh, my toes. 
[02:29:00]  Uh, uh, Patty.  Yeah?  You ever take, like, uh, a monkey wrench to your toe and bend it back?  No.  I don't think so.  How did you get the hammer toe?  Well, I don't know.  I think it's just that when I was in college, I didn't have a lot of money.  I couldn't afford shoes, so I had to get them from the church or something, and some of  the shoes were too small for me, but it was all I could do.  I didn't have a family. 
[02:29:30]  The church effed up your feet.  What did you, uh, you wear shoes that, uh, were in the shape of a boomerang when you were  younger?  No, they were just like a half a size too small because that was all I could find.  And, you know, I used to shop at, you know, this is going back 20 years ago, though.  I don't shop that way anymore.  I have a question for you, Patty.  Um, because, Jason, genetically, basically, you're septic tank water.  When you were a kid, did the other kids notice that your toes looked like tree roots?  No, they didn't say anything. 
[02:30:00]  No.  All right.  Well, Patty, we've got to take a break.  Okay.  But, uh, you've enlightened all of us today.  Yeah.  And, uh, if that, um, got you upset, Patty, um, I'd like to offer, um, our, uh...  A free pedicure.  Nothing.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I think, uh, the person that is brave enough to give, uh, Stalker Patty the pedicure should  go see Britney Spears.  You know what we should do?  Huh? 
[02:30:30]  When she comes in, just step on her foot real hard.  Yeah.  Slam your heel down on her big toe.  Or plier.  Peel back those toenails with a plier.  Take some needle-nose pliers and just twist it back like a sardine can opening.  And then put, like, after the toenail is removed, you put pins in the little fleshy  area of the toenail.  Right.  And then rub in with your thumb, rub in some rock salt.  All right.  Just rub it hard.  Hey, Patty?  Yeah?  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  Okay.  All right.  I'm sorry, Patty. 
[02:31:00]  I apologize for referring to you as a hammer-toed zero.  Oh, that's okay, Jim.  All right.  All right.  See you on the subway in a half hour.  Yeah, right.  I know.  We're just kidding, even though you're on it every night when I'm on it.  Bye, Patty.  Bye.  All right.  Let's take a break, yeah?  I can't wait to watch her pass out from a pedicure.  That music is my favorite thing.  It's up.  She was crying.  I put my hair, but it's like I'm good hygiene. 
[02:31:30]  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears tickets?  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back with the show.  Running out of show really fast here, Anthony.  I know.  Where does the day go?  So busy today. 
[02:32:00]  Chris Barron in the studio from the Spin Doctor.  Chris.  Hi, guys.  What's happening?  Gentlemen.  He's got a gig tonight at Fez, right?  Yeah, the Fez.  Where is the Fez?  The Fez is Great Jones and Lafayette in New York City.  Down below the Time Cafe.  It's like, you know, a pretty little room.  I saw Sean Lennon there.  Really?  He was amazing.  Yeah?  Will you be doing some Spin Doctor songs?  Yeah, like maybe one or two.  Yeah.  Mostly doing my stuff.  Doing the new stuff.  Chris Barron.  I'm going to have a ukulele. 
[02:32:30]  Do you?  Down there.  There's some Tiny Tim.  You want to hear some Tiny Tim?  Yeah, let me hear some Tiny Tim.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Tiptoe through the tulips in the garden.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Tiptoe through the tulips with me.  That freak.  You're supposed to say, I knew Tiny Tim and you're no Tiny Tim.  You're no Tiny Tim.  That's when you thought the show couldn't get gear.  Tiny Tim.  Nicky, what's going on? 
[02:33:00]  Nothing much.  All right.  I can put hemostats on my nits.  What's hemostats?  Those are those things that...  You know what a roach clip is?  Yeah, it's like a big roach clip.  They use it in the medical industry to block off arteries and what...  Yeah, but I can't get off a walk.  I want to come up and do that.  And you want to do that for the Britney Spears tickets?  Yeah, I think that's kind of unusual.  It's kind of painful.  Are you a girl?  Yeah.  I just wanted to clear that up right away.  Yeah, I'm a girl.  You sound like a young boy.  Oh, dear.  No, I'm not a young boy. 
[02:33:30]  Wow, dear.  Well, if you can't get out of work, you can't get out of work.  Yeah, I know.  I tried already.  They won't let me get off.  And that's not really, like, that good.  I know.  For the Britney Spears tickets, come on.  People do that and get pierced.  You know what I mean?  We're very picky, by the way.  We only have one contestant for Friday so far.  I know, but we've got to be.  And we've had hundreds of moms call so far, but nothing has whetted our appetite.  Yeah, I've noticed.  I thought I'd try.  That's all.  All right, Nicky.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Chris, you're going to have to come back when we have more show, you know.  Well, I would love to.  That was one of those busy days.  We just wanted to squeeze in because we knew you had to. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.  You guys can come down to my gig.  Want to sit in?  Well, look at him.  I'm a mess, man.  He ain't going anywhere.  He would sit in, too.  And he would impress you.  I so would.  But look, look.  I got, like, medicine.  I'm a mess.  You poor thing.  God, this sucks.  I never get, if you understand, I never get sick.  You know what you got to do?  You're not a good sick person, Anthony.  I hate it.  You got to go down to Chinatown.  Yeah.  And these, like, those Chinese doctors down there, they have cured the common cold.  They have?  You have to drink, like, bug tea and stuff like that. 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  I'd rather have the cold.  They have cured the common cold.  You have to put a goose neck up a balloon knot.  Hemostat.  Hemostat on nippers.  And she-mostat.  Let me go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, I want to tell you what I learned today.  Oh, we can start that, I guess.  I learned that.  And I also learned Giuliani wants snorting off the streets because he's a whore.  All right.  Long-lip bugger, haven't a tongue thing.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  Thank you. 
[02:35:00]  I didn't understand that.  I don't know what he was talking about.  He had, like, plugs in at the end that no one's going to get except the people.  Anthony, Jersey Gary is always good for a few?  Yeah.  I learned on the O&A show today, line of the day, Opie looking at his mom's boob at 12 drove  him to look at his dad's junk at 13.  Uncle John rules.  All right.  Look at that.  Cross-promoting another listener there, Jersey Gary.  After listening to O&A for three and a half years, I actually learned something extremely  useful today.  No snot is not, uh, no snot is the anthrax. 
[02:35:30]  Excuse me.  Oh, no snot is the anthrax.  Is anthrax.  Right.  Exactly.  That is true.  Well, then I, uh, guess I, I hope I don't have the, uh, anthrax.  You've got some flu symptoms, but your runny nose, that means you don't have the anthrax.  It's a cold.  I have, like, the snot, and, uh, I'm sneezing and a slight cough.  Right.  If you had all the other symptoms and not the runny nose, it could be the anthrax.  Oh, God.  Cloning would be all right with the church if they all turned out to be hairless choir  boys.  You're not gay if you could give yourself oral treats, and it's sick if you give your, uh, 
[02:36:00]  clone oral treats, but not vice versa.  Okay, terrific.  Uh, Jersey Gary also writes, we're all living in God's snow globe.  Anthony is traveling to two dimensions tonight, and finally, let's not forget to subtract  an additional nine months.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, Rich from Philly.  I learned today, Opie doesn't think that wah-wah is gay as long as it doesn't have the  pfft, pfft at the end.  According to Norton, someone who does the wah-wah without doing the pfft, pfft at the end  is just a bad date.  Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Uh, our listeners are going to kill us, but we have to take another break.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, we went like an hour without commercials.  Yeah.  And this is the downside of that.  When we come back, we'll continue with what do we learn.  And we'll talk to Chris Barron for another 30 seconds.  But he's playing Fez tonight.  Yeah.  And it sounds like it's going to be a good show, so.  Check it out.  8 o'clock.  8 o'clock tonight with Chris Barron, former lead singer of the Spin Doctors.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  That wasn't too bad, was it? 
[02:37:00]  That was a lot quicker than usual.  We're trying, man.  We're trying.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Chris Barron, former lead singer of the Spin Doctors in the studio.  Yeah.  I'll read what has been handed to me.  The beautiful and talented Chris Barron, singer and songwriter of Spin Doctors fame,  will be performing live and in person 8 p.m. tonight at the Fez in New York City  on the corner of Great Jones and Lafayette under the Time Cafe.  Mention Opie and Anthony at the door, and you will receive no special benefit. 
[02:37:30]  There you go.  All right, man.  And you're going to come back when you can hang some more, right?  I would love to.  Thank you.  You know, you've got to listen to the show and hear when we've got something really going  on in here, like last time, and then you pop in.  That was classic.  Now it's just, you know, it's guys' locker room here today.  Yeah, we've got to go right to the phones.  Ralph, what's going on, man?  Nothing, man.  I learned today that Stalk and Patty's Bath Ritual is about the same thing thoroughbred horses 
[02:38:00]  go before they get shooed.  Yeah, you've got to brush our toenails.  And could you picture some guy just picking her foot up going, and then cleaning out the  nail with that hook thing, and then taking those big clippers and just clipping off chunks  of her hoof?  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Stalker Patty gets a pedicure.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Who's not listening to that?  And we're going to invite guys that are into feet down here.  Foot fetish guys.  Foot fetish guys down here.  So, keep me on that list. 
[02:38:30]  All right, Ralph.  Thank you.  Hey, the other thing there, too, is that NyQuil probably could make about 50% interest  on their sales if they threw a worm in the bottle.  All right, Ralph.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Have a good night.  Anthony, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, guys?  I learned ABCD, not ABDC.  Right.  Crinkle, crinkle, always funny.  Oh, yeah.  According to Norton, Camel Toe looks like two boxing gloves.  Yeah.  Patty's toes look like tree roots.  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  And if you want one and then you tuk-tuk, you're a bad date.  Very good.  You learned a lot, my friend.  Yes, I did.  Go forth and teach.  I'll try.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  I learned it's okay to do the boss's daughter because you won't get fired, but your girlfriend  will.  Wow.  True.  Jerry from Addison, Norton is literally busted gut funny.  Bust the colostomy back.  I don't believe that guy.  Spork from PA. 
[02:39:30]  Today, I learned Opie needs his faith.  Jeff from Manhattan.  I learned that the Bible was written millions of years ago.  Ziggy from D.C.  I learned that the earth is not a plate resting on a tortoise's back.  And Eric from Long Island.  Go Islanders, by the way.  Oh, jeez.  It's a sealed bat.  What?  I think they're playing the Capitals tonight, right?  Yeah, right.  They haven't beat the Capitals in a really long time.  But today, I learned Thanksgiving turkey at Anthony's equals flashbacks of mom's ass  crack.  Yeah.  That's right. 
[02:40:00]  Going to carry in Vegas.  This is our second call ever from Vegas, I think.  Kerry, what's up?  What's up?  That was what I learned today.  I thought it was a girl, Kerry.  Girl.  Just what I thought the show couldn't get any gayer, you guys were able to prove me wrong.  Tell me you weren't laughing today.  It was a gay show.  I was laughing, but there was a point that I just went, okay, this is not a San Francisco  radio station.  Why is this going on?  You're in Vegas.  Why aren't you in a casino?  It was way too gay, guys.  All right.  Go to a whorehouse. 
[02:40:30]  Go to a whorehouse or a casino.  You're in Vegas.  Don't worry about us.  Go to a whorehouse.  Yeah.  At least we don't have gay whorehouses, thank God.  All right, Kerry.  Thank you.  I learned people don't have vending machines in their homes.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Great show.  I learned today that Psycho Mark will soon be filing suit against WAAF for his role in  the Sex Across New England campaign.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We started the show with an outrageous rant there, Anthony. 
[02:41:00]  Rockhole stealing more of our stuff.  It's the Sex for Sam contest we do.  He's going to be doing Sex for Sam, something we've done twice no one else has done.  And something we wanted to do up in Boston.  And we will do it because I'm sure.  It's been written up in national publications.  He has no shame.  He's decided the only way to compete with us is to take our best bits and just redo them  in Boston.  And we're just praying that Boston knows the difference.  And, guys, if there turns out to be a way that we here in the New York, New Jersey area  can help in this campaign against that just a-hole. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, just make his life a living hell.  Yeah.  That's easy.  A lot of our listeners were calling him while he was doing a show today.  And, you know, they were just freaking out, getting pissed, and yelling and screaming  at people.  So we're getting to him.  And it's very easy to get to someone that is very paranoid.  I've left a few messages on the blow-me line.  Oh, blow-me line.  Doesn't that sound like the FU line?  You know, ironically, it really does.  Two things in one week he took from us.  He has no shame.  Yeah, guys, I feel your pain, man.  And keep, you know, I know the struggle, guys. 
[02:42:00]  I know the struggle.  I know a lot of you guys were helping us out today with the cause and calling and stuff.  But you can't let up.  You've got to keep doing it.  Keep going.  And we got some tricks up our sleeve because, you know, we have finally had it.  Yeah, well, you know, I teach at a Catholic school.  Until it becomes socially acceptable for me to kick a priest in the taint, you know, I'll  at the very least help fight your battles.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Cool.  That's good, Uncle John.  Uncle John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Norton may or may not be a hit with geriatric set. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, we don't know that.  We might find out tomorrow, though, right?  I think he was lying, though.  He was definitely lying.  Uncle John, you've been listening to us for a very long time.  Too long, guys.  How gay was the show today?  Well, I'm starting to doubt my manhood.  Yeah.  Pretty gay.  Yeah, when gay ran...  But it was fun gay.  Oh, it was terrible.  When gay Randy called in, it was...  You know, like we had a gay old time.  Like the Flintstones version.  Like the Flintstones.  All right.  I got myself out of that one.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  All right, Uncle John.  Thank you.  Yes, I did.  And it was in a freaking TV song.  We'll have a gay old time.  We're having a gay old time today.  Fun gay.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned today...  Great show, by the way.  I learned today that the only people who are against cloning are fat people and ugly people.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  And the gay old time was the Flintstones theme song.  Right.  Yes, of course.  All right.  Norton rules.  Norton rules.  Thank you, sir.  Janine.  Yeah.  What's up?  You're in Buffalo. 
[02:43:30]  Yep.  All right.  What's going on in Buffalo?  Nothing.  Can I come down for the tickets on Friday?  I lived there for three years.  You just nailed it.  You got a wacky little voice on you.  Yeah.  What's up with you?  I don't know.  I got a bad cold.  You aren't a guy, are you?  No.  How old are you?  20.  There's no way you could be hot with a voice like that.  Sounds nervous.  Because it says on the thing, I want to be in the Britney Spears contest.  I want to strip naked and have ONA lick hot fudge off me.  Ooh. 
[02:44:00]  But how are you going to get down here?  Huh?  Drive.  Are you a guy?  No, I'm not.  You really sound like a guy.  Can you call us tomorrow?  Because we can goof on you for at least a half hour.  Yeah, you got to call us tomorrow.  Can you call us back tomorrow?  Yes.  All right.  Well, we'll talk to you tomorrow, all right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  There goes Janine from Buffalo.  What's that?  Rob, what's up?  Hey, Rob.  Hey, I learned that Stalker Patty's a clone gone bad.  She got the talons of a bald eagle and the body of an ant. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  And Norton's God.  Norton's God.  Yes, he is.  All right, my friend.  Say it.  Bye.  We got to get out of here.  You're right in.  Oh, I made it.  You made it.  I am going to over-medicate.  He walked into the office today.  I'm like, ah.  I don't know what happened overnight.  I'm thinking there's no way.  An ant never gets sick.  I'm the one that always gets sick.  Yeah.  I was fine.  Last night, three sneezes in a row.  Boom. 
[02:45:00]  It's over.  You're like me, though.  I mean, I think I took once, well, a few sick days when my throat just completely gave out.  I have to be here no matter if...  I don't call in sick.  It's not a job.  I don't think you...  This isn't a job.  I don't think you ever called in sick.  And you call up Apollo Air Conditioning and tell him, ask him how many times I called in sick  when I was installing air conditioning duct work.  He was...  I was out more than I was in, in that place.  I swear to God.  Anything I would call up, can't make it.  Oh, very sick, very sick. 
[02:45:30]  Out on the jet ski.  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  Can't make it.  Oh, yeah.  A truck broke down.  I saw you in the truck just 15 minutes ago driving away from a bar.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me.  All right.  But now, you know, I get sick.  What am I going to...  You know, it's not a job.  You know, a great trick when you were sick, I used to do this all the time, is you actually  call from your room and you hang out the window so it sounds like you're outside  and then say you're broken down on a highway somewhere.  Oh, that's good.  I do that about 40 times.  You don't have to sound because you hear the outside noise. 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  I have a bump on the back of my skull.  Every job I ever had, one time I walked in there and said, I fell down in the shower  and I feel the bump.  Feel this bump.  So you're saying to do that like if you're in a hotel room?  Did you say a hotel you hang out the window?  No, I hang out my room.  Out the window in my room.  With that, let's get the hell out of here.  Chris Barron from the Spin Doctors, formerly of the Spin Doctors, have fun at Fez tonight  downtown, okay?  All right.  And come back when we have a little more time.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for having me.  And we're going to leave with Sheep Lover from Jersey. 
[02:46:30]  Anthony, I learned today 19 minus 4 minus 9 months equals slut.  With that, we'll see you guys tomorrow for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys and drive down there and back your  heads in with a baseball bat.  One, two, three-year-old.  One, two, three, four, two. 
[02:47:00]  Let's see now.  When we dig down those 12-year-old kabinok down there, we'll love you all rise.  Game on Star Wars Lab.  Two, three, three, three, four, three.  Of course.  There's a lot of people who work andarten who need all the powerl run.  Two, four, three, three, four.  Three, three, four, three, four, three.  Three of the three.  Three, four, four, seven, one.  Three, four, three, four, six, yes.  Three, four, four, and three, four.  Three, four, four, six, five, four, seven, three, six, six.  Two, three, four, ten, four, four, three, four, seven, six, halfway. </pre>
