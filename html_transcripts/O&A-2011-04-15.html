<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show featured a lengthy segment with an impressive guest lineup: Ricky Gervais, Louis C.K., Ronnie B., Jim Norton, and Jay Moore. The conversation began with jovial ribbing about Gervais' recent weight loss, contrasting it with Louis C.K.'s intense workout regime followed by unhealthy indulgences.  This led to humorous exchanges about differing measurement systems, with jabs taken at American units.

The discussion quickly transitioned to HBO's "Talking Funny," a documentary featuring Gervais, C.K., Chris Rock, and Jerry Seinfeld.  The group recounted the filming process, describing it as a casual, hours-long conversation punctuated by hilarious and awkward moments, including an anecdote about Louis C.K. accidentally soiling his pants.

The conversation broadened to include other projects, like Gervais' interview with Gary Shandling and his show "Idiot Abroad," featuring Carl, whose unconventional behavior and the producers' deceptive methods to secure his participation were discussed.  Further topics included contrasting comedy philosophies of Seinfeld and Louis C.K., anecdotes about eccentric celebrities, Gervais' self-deprecating award acceptance speech, Louis C.K.'s responses to insults, and numerous crude and sexually explicit jokes.  The show also compared and contrasted the comedic styles of Jerry Seinfeld, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, and Louis C.K.,  describing Seinfeld as a technical master, Pryor and Carlin as geniuses in different styles (personal and observational, respectively), and Louis C.K.'s comedy as viscerally driven and human. The Marx Brothers' comedic evolution from chaotic beginnings to later formulaic films was also briefly discussed.  Gervais recounted his experience opening for Seinfeld early in his career and shared his opinions on Seinfeld's style.  The segment included numerous off-color jokes, including repeated references to rape, and tangents about award shows and the nature of observational versus personal comedy.  The show concluded with continued promotion of "Talking Funny" and Gervais' other projects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the studio, Ricky Gervais, it's an all-star lineup.  You've got Louis C.K., Ricky Gervais, Ronnie B., Jim Norton, and Jay Moore.  Oh, my God.  How are you, Ricky?  Very well, thank you.  And you walk in the room, and everyone just starts talking about how much weight you lost.  Yeah.  And that it could be because maybe something's so common with you.  I was saying that he looks easy for a fat guy.  I was being polite, but there you go.  Lots of half slices.  Brilliant.  A lot of half slices.  Half slice?  Half slice.  Look at you, you big fat slob.  Yeah, I'm eating.  You've got no regard for the people listening.  This is what Ricky does when he starts shitting on me because he's deflecting negative attention from himself. 
[00:00:30]  Attaboy, Lou.  He thinks I'm an easy target because I'm kind of heavy, and I eat in front of people.  I'm a little messy.  It's not going to bother you.  No, it doesn't.  But Louie runs, like, 10 miles a day.  Do you still run?  Not these days, no.  I saw Louie, like, in a locker room in Las Vegas, and he just got off a treadmill, like, for 12 miles.  I used to run a lot.  And then he goes right into, like, a Waffle House.  That's right.  And he said, you run so you can eat that way.  That's right.  Oh, really?  Maintain his shitty health. 
[00:01:00]  Fuck, that's a smart way to do it.  That would kill me if I didn't exercise.  That's smart.  It would kill me.  That's smart.  Yeah.  I've never...  But you're pretty fit, though, aren't you?  You box and you run about.  You're just big.  You're boxing training.  But you're naturally big as well, aren't you?  I have a big body, yeah.  I always think of Louie.  You know the thing in the Fantastic Four?  It's like you peeled off all the lumpy bits, and that's what you left with Louie CK.  Delete it.  More or less.  Ricky, how much did you lose?  Let's get it out of the way.  You know how much you like.  You're trying to act like casual.  Well, I'm saying that you're totally... 
[00:01:30]  That's what I am now.  I was...  I'll convert this for you Americans.  I was...  For you Americans.  I was 13 stone...  Thirteen.  Say no more.  Oh, I don't know.  Worthless country of fucking idiots.  And now I'm 12 stone three.  You lost five quid.  So you lost less than a pound?  He actually lost Sly into family stone in a matter of two months.  No, like he sits in a big scale and they put rocks on the other side of the scale.  That's how fucking shitty your dumb country is.  Brilliant.  Yeah, you've nailed us. 
[00:02:00]  Well done.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Brilliant.  Aren't the English stupid?  For having empirical white systems.  Well, you started with, oh, you Americans.  I have to convert this for you Americans.  Yeah, that's what pissed off Louis.  That got me going.  How was that an insult?  I'll be the ref.  That's what pissed off Louis.  I knew the differences between our white systems.  Nah, you insulted him a little bit yourself.  Yeah.  You got a little out on yourself.  De Niro coming through.  Louis doesn't go for the anti-US shit.  He never has. 
[00:02:30]  No.  Thank you.  All right.  What are you having there?  Yeah.  Should we start?  What are you having?  We started.  Yeah, we're already taping.  What did they bring you?  What are you having?  I want to know what that is.  This is radio.  No one knows who brought me.  They brought me anything.  Well, I'm telling you, somebody brought.  Someone brought you something.  Look at all these hot chicks in here.  Look at all these hot babes.  Wacky time.  For the big Ricky Gervais interview.  Now we need to know what you're drinking, because now we did bring it to the attention of everybody.  This isn't radio.  It's a cup of tea, and they brought me some milk to put in it, right? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, just, let's have a conversation.  Let's have a conversation.  Yay!  Let's have a conversation about stuff.  Do you prefer skim milk now that you look better?  Yes!  Yeah, I do.  I do, too.  Oh, this is good practice when I do the view.  Your show is good.  I saw the episode.  Thank you.  It was fucking great, man.  That's what I'm here for.  Normally, comics, I mean, Louie said, normally listening to comedians talk about comedy is  revolting, but it wasn't.  Honestly, it was fucking really insightful, and everybody was honest. 
[00:03:30]  It was fucking great.  Let's get the name of this.  I really enjoyed it.  It was really good fun.  I was really worried that there'd be lots of talking over each other, but it was good  because we really came at it from four different points of view as well.  Louie was great.  He was brilliant because it was like he wasn't doing it like he was on television.  Do you know what I mean?  I think that's his life, though.  I think in most things, he does.  You get some in your eyebrow.  You get like a crumb in your eyebrow.  Look, I want to get the basics out. 
[00:04:00]  It's called Talking Funny.  It's on HBO.  Is it a one and done?  Because that's what we can't figure out.  Well, at the moment, we'll see how it goes down.  Okay.  Then we can do some more with better comedians.  And it's you, Louie C.K., Chris Rock, and Jerry Seinfeld.  That's right.  It picks up from mid-conversation.  It just starts like literally like the first half was chopped off, which is great because  there's no lead up.  They're just talking.  Well, that's kind of what it was like, wasn't it?  Because we sat down, and they mic'd this, and we're all chatting already.  We started talking in the hallway, all four of us. 
[00:04:30]  And so they start corralling us to our seats, and we don't even notice the difference where  now we're sitting in chairs, and somebody's micing us, and we just kept talking.  And I think at some point we realized we've been on this show now for 40 minutes or something.  Yeah.  Because it was like five hours, wasn't it?  That shoot?  Afterwards, I thought, oh, I wasn't really funny, and I didn't talk about comedy.  Because I was thinking, this is a TV show.  We'd better have something to talk about.  But it just sort of flowed.  And we talked for about four and a half hours, didn't we?  Yeah.  And then cut it down.  So it's nice and tight.  What are you going to do with the other three and a half hours? 
[00:05:00]  I think a lot of comedy fans would love to hear that.  Yeah, we've got that.  A lot of that.  At one point, Louis just shut his pants, so we had to clear it out.  I had to take that out.  I had to take that out.  It was really funny.  I do that every...  That's how I...  I just...  That's part of my maintenance.  Ricky's done this before with Gary Shanling, that was the most amazing, uncomfortable, hysterical...  We went to Gary Shanling's house, and Gary Shanling looked cagey and felt invaded. 
[00:05:30]  And it's the two of them talking, and Gary just not letting Ricky have a conversation with him, really.  I think...  And then he left.  I know.  It's fascinating.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Where can you see that?  It was sort of in a different place then.  And he spoke to me afterwards, and he said, oh, I tried something.  It didn't quite work.  So I think that...  What was he doing, a character?  Well, I think...  Well, no, I think he thought we were filming for his DVD at one point, because we were going  to do that as well.  So I think he was sort of in a different sort of place for it. 
[00:06:00]  But, yeah, it's interesting.  I left in all the awkward bits.  I think you've got to.  Yeah, what is there to try during an interview?  Someone's interviewing you.  Like, I tried something.  What?  I can't answer the questions.  Well, he tried.  He kind of tried being unpleasant.  Just like he's acting like he didn't want to do it.  But it's fascinating.  It's like a great hysterical interview, and you're just like, I'm so glad I'm not there.  I'm just glad I'm watching.  I'm getting to just watch.  You know, it's great.  Well, I couldn't...  The thing is, what I couldn't do is I didn't want to sort of come back at him too much, 
[00:06:30]  because I'm this young pretender seeing my hero, and I thought it would have looked  really bad.  So I don't know if I...  Did it look like I was sort of caught in the headlights a little bit?  Yeah, but it looked like you were enjoying it.  It looked like you were, you know, taking some shots from a guy that you're like, this  is still great, that I'm here at his house having fun.  That's the thing about it that's fun to watch.  Yeah.  Is that he's slinging these horrible comments at you, and you're kind of giggling.  Yeah, you were laughing.  There's nothing funnier than being insulted. 
[00:07:00]  There is nothing.  If somebody insults me, I'll lie down.  Oh, you get excited, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, not in that way, but yeah.  Do you...  What way?  Oh.  Ricky, do you like being uncomfortable?  You get a boner when people insult you.  I love being uncomfortable.  I think Louie loves it.  He gets an erection when people insult him.  That's what we're trying to do for.  He gets a hard penis.  What is it about being...  When people insult him.  I'm glad you quantified that.  He gets his father used to do it.  I'm not sure what erection meant.  His father used to say, you piece of shit, and then he would get really hard, and he'd  go jack off and come in his room. 
[00:07:30]  When he says I'm getting an erection, I'm still flaccid.  That's my version of an erection.  He gets his softer.  Do you jerk off on your...  He goes softer, in fact, but then...  Yeah.  Do you jerk off on your back or your stomach?  I can't jerk off on my back.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you mean laying on my back?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought you meant like a fountain.  No, no, no, no, no.  It goes up there and I catch it like David Beckham doing ball tricks.  Hey, watch this.  Yeah.  The bicycle kick.  The bicycle kick with his own cums.  That's right. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, it's like radio.  Why do you like being uncomfortable?  Well, I don't like being uncomfortable.  I don't really get uncomfortable.  I like when the situation's uncomfortable.  Well, I think being embarrassed is almost admitting it.  If you're a party and you come out of the toilet and you've got a piss stain and everyone's  sort of like, you know, not saying anything and you look down and you see it, that's just  embarrassing.  If you come out and go, look, I've pissed myself.  There's no embarrassment.  Right.  Do you know what I mean?  Why do you have a piss stain when you go to the bathroom?  Exactly.  On the back of the front. 
[00:08:30]  I've told you I've been doing cum tricks and I popped it away too quickly.  You just piss through your pants.  You just let it go through your...  Why do you even go to the bathroom?  I filter it through.  Like when your nan used to strain, sort of jam through...  My nan.  Stockings.  Oh, oh.  That's right.  My nan.  I forgot about my nan.  Don't forget who invented English.  It's not about the words.  It's we don't have nans.  We had parents and then we raised ourselves.  We didn't have fucking nan.  What the fuck is it?  I don't mean nanny.  I mean gran.  I mean grandmother. 
[00:09:00]  That's our word for gran.  I don't know what that is.  All right.  Then say parents.  I don't know what that is.  Brilliant.  I don't know what that is.  Me nan.  Jesus Christ.  And over here, we all call our grandparents different things than even our neighbors.  Like we don't have a catchphrase for that.  Right.  People go mum, mum, papa, pay, pay.  This makes shit up for grandparents.  Your grandfather is just the guy who molests you.  Oh, that's sad.  I didn't mean to ruin the movie.  It's not only that.  It's sad.  It was sad.  It's true.  You got to align yourself.  Do you feel bad when you liked it though? 
[00:09:30]  No, not at all.  I kind of egged it on.  That's why they're shame.  Those diapers fell off by themselves.  That's why they're shame.  Because it feels good.  Sure there is.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You guys invented incest too over there, didn't you?  It is very popular.  It is very, very popular, actually.  Only in sort of like the sort of more the countryside, I suppose.  Peter Philly is definitely more popular in England than America. 
[00:10:00]  I thought you said a guy's name, Peter Philly.  Peter Philly is very popular.  Don't you ever edit what comes out of your mind?  You ever thought?  Why do that?  Don't bother saying that.  Why do that?  That's not ready.  That's not ready for an anecdote yet.  Let's keep that in there for a little while.  Why do that?  I don't fucking shit with Epi.  No, I don't.  That's right.  That's why your new CD is called No Filter.  I want to feel bad about that, but I don't. 
[00:10:30]  I just can't.  Do people sort of listen, going to work, in their cars, to show?  Do you get any feedback about this show?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are they doing?  They've been on the air for like 20 years.  They never got any feedback.  I don't think it's going out.  No.  They really don't think it's like some big practical joke.  If you need to know, we won't be looking at feedback today, Rick.  I want to do that with Celebrity Big Brother or something like that. 
[00:11:00]  They go in there, then after six weeks, you say, we weren't filming.  We weren't filming any of that.  Yeah, you just wasted six weeks of your PR.  How great would that be?  That would be so great.  You're noting that people still don't know who you are.  That would be so great.  Wouldn't it be great?  Just see their faces.  Would the real show be filming them after?  Yeah, exactly.  Yes, the real show would be watching their reaction.  All right, no filter.  I'm talking to Abby Inter here.  Relax.  You're talking to who?  A heavy hitter here, you know.  You should film them, though.  You have to film them anyway.  You can't just not film them.  You have to film them, tell them you did, and then film the rest after. 
[00:11:30]  Jim, Ricky, and I was talking to you.  No, but you didn't get them.  No, I know, but you weren't painting the whole picture.  You were fucking telling them a shit show.  I'm trying to fucking help you.  You were going to pitch a bad show.  He's working on it.  What the fuck is bad about it?  Just film them after?  What if some shit happened during, you had to film them during and just lie to them?  What, are you going to tell them the truth?  Like, we really didn't film you?  Then you're wasting the cruise time.  You're being greedy.  I think the thing you have to do is really put people in a room for, like, three months  and tell them that they're on a show that's going to be huge, and don't film it, and don't  film their reaction.  Just for yourself, enjoy shitting on those people. 
[00:12:00]  Can't you film it and show them their face when you told them it was being filmed?  No, don't film that either.  Don't film it at all.  Just enjoy that.  No one will ever know about it.  No one will ever know what happens.  Just an enormous dinner box.  Don't even just let it go out by word of mouth.  Send messengers out.  If somebody could figure out a way to advertise on word of mouth, that would be really something.  You're not allowed to tell this story unless you say, you know, buy a Buick or something  like that.  Yeah.  I wanted to do that with starving Africans. 
[00:12:30]  I wanted to hit the button.  Give them t-shirts with, like, Office DVD still available or something.  So then when you saw it on the news thing, they were sort of, they were getting free  clothes and stuff.  Right.  And then you say, please feed this kid.  Yeah.  And people are like, oh, fuck, the Office is still out there.  Yeah.  You can still get that.  That's what you would advertise, is that your show from 20 years ago is still on DVD.  That's what you would advertise.  Okay, Talking Funny on HBO on the 22nd.  There we go.  Of April.  Of April.  9pm. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  We started talking about that, didn't we?  What?  Well, I don't know what else he was very kind to.  Well, there was different philosophies.  The interesting part is to hear, you know, Jerry's philosophy is a lot different about  keeping the act than Louis, who flips his act every year.  And it was just interesting to hear them kind of fucking banter that back and forth.  Yeah.  I couldn't get over that.  Jerry is like the Rolling Stones.  You know, he just...  Just the hits.  Yeah.  He goes to sort of Vegas and he tours around and he never commits anything to DVD.  Doesn't that get boring? 
[00:13:30]  No, well, I think he's sort of...  No, he loves the bits.  It's an evolution, isn't it?  Yeah.  And he thinks that people come to see him and the act.  That's right.  He does that thing.  He does that thing.  But do you think the Rolling Stones like just playing the hits?  Or do you think they would really want to get up there and fool around?  Well, somebody told me they...  I know who knows...  None of this is true.  But whatever.  I was told by somebody.  I'm going down the road with the credibility of the story.  You realize this fucking nut is very thin.  I need to hear it anyway now.  But somebody told me that Keith Richards has a guitar for every song. 
[00:14:00]  And the guitars are pre-tuned instead of having the regular six-string tuning.  They're tuned so he can just put one finger across the board and just play the chords.  Five strings.  He takes the six strings.  He takes the six strings and he just plays so he can just be barely awake and just be running through the...  I don't know if that's fun.  Would you go crazy if you weren't changing up your act?  Louis, hold on.  Yeah, I think I would have quit if I didn't start doing that.  I think the person that told you that was Keith in his book.  Oh, did he say that in his book? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it's a huge chapter about...  So it is true.  I take the six-string off all my guitars.  That's why you can't pick up a guitar in a guitar shop and just play Start Me Up.  It sounds weird because there's six strings.  He uses the six-string to tie off with.  He started like that as a kid and then he's always right.  Are you criticizing Louis for telling that story?  He's like, all right, keep this under your hats.  I got the inside skinny on the stone.  I knew a guy.  Check this out.  We're scalping Mets tickets.  We're in Queens.  Guy comes up to me and tells me Keith Wichert's story. 
[00:15:00]  Now, I can't vouch for the guy.  You managed a band called Suede?  Well, yeah, sort of.  Oh, my God.  Sort of how?  Well, I had him out and then that comes out once you're, you know, now...  You could say famous.  You can say it, Ricky.  It hurts, doesn't it?  It still makes me feel slightly weird.  Famous fucking guy.  You're a celebrity.  Yeah.  You're a shiny, shiny star.  Yeah.  Stars don't fall from the sky, do they?  No, they don't.  So are you now. 
[00:15:30]  You're a sparkly star.  Yeah.  You won the Comedy Award, didn't you?  You beat me.  Yeah, I did beat you.  Best stand-up.  You and Whitney Cummings.  Yeah, no, deserved.  You deserved it.  There's only three people nominated for a comedian.  Who was the fourth?  I just remember Ricky because I like him.  I remember Whitney for the other thing.  What?  Who was the fourth?  Slappy White was in there doing great.  I don't remember the other one.  Stephen Hawking was probably...  Father Guido Sarducci.  He should have won.  He says things funny. 
[00:16:00]  He says I'm a funny...  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, that was a dumb thing, the awards.  It was stupid.  It's nice.  It was.  It's the first time they did them, and nobody cared.  24 hours later, you take a shit all over their nice program.  They just gave you a fucking award.  Show some gratitude.  Did you even turn up?  What if I give you an award?  I say thanks a lot.  Then you have to say nice things about me?  I say nice things about you everywhere I know.  You're a fucking great guy.  Here's the water award.  You never say...  Are you fucking shit on me?  You never say anything bad about me. 
[00:16:30]  I gave you the water award.  Louie's incredible.  It's beautiful.  But what award is worth something, though?  It's only a matter of how long it's been going,  how credible it is who turns up.  That's right.  It's still the opinion.  Was it voted or was it...  They told everybody three weeks ahead of time that they won,  and then you showed up, and it was like three weeks ago,  and then it was on the news that people won.  I was canvassing right up to the day.  It's still weird.  I was wasting a million pounds phoning everyone I ever knew.  What did they hand you, Louie? 
[00:17:00]  What did the award look like?  Did you turn up?  Yeah, I went because it's an industry for my house.  Thank you.  I'm Louie C.K.  I may look cynical on the outside.  That's right.  I said my name, too.  I want to be...  Can I be friends with you?  I know Ricky Gervais.  He's famous.  I want to be famous.  I know Chris Rock as well.  I've got a watch by Chris Rock.  He came here.  Oh, my God.  You fucking...  Oh, my God.  That's brutal.  He really is saying that you say one thing,  but you're really a speech-making cunt at the awards show. 
[00:17:30]  No, it's true.  It's true.  Mostly I want to thank the other nominees.  Yes.  Whitney and Ricky.  That's right.  And whoever the fucking fourth guy is that we don't know.  I like the way that I identify myself during that speech, though.  Oh, I'm Louie C.K.  Like, I would say my own name.  He's an immigrant cleaning houses.  Oh, hello.  I'm T.K.K.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, I love Louie.  Oh.  I shared a plane ride with him once, right?  It's on YouTube.  And look it up. 
[00:18:00]  It's Ricky and Louie goes to New York.  That's right.  And it was when we were filming The Invention of Lyons.  Shut the fuck up.  Right?  And we were living in Lowell, weren't we?  Lowell, Massachusetts.  Yeah.  Thoughts?  It's all right, wasn't it?  About Lowell?  Yeah.  It's a show.  I met Mickey Ward there.  I know.  It's a big relationship.  Absolutely, yeah.  No, sir.  He traveled with me and trained me for the special I did the next year.  He went on the road with me and trained me as a boxer for my special.  Yeah.  He's an amazing guy.  But I met him.  He was driving trucks for the show, for the movie. 
[00:18:30]  He still is, I think.  Yeah.  He's a working guy.  Yeah.  And then we were on a private jet.  That's right.  Ricky had a private jet that the company gave him, and it flew to New York.  And we're here.  Hold on.  Those are two words that don't go together.  Private jet, lol.  Yeah, no, not very much.  We were the only private jet to ever land in, well, we didn't land in New York.  They were all looking at me.  They were all looking at me until they fell over like penguins.  And we were here in New York, and I was getting a ride back with him, and he was getting pissy 
[00:19:00]  because I was late, and I was late because my dog got hit by a truck.  No, you weren't.  No, on the way there, he's late.  I'm waiting for him.  It turns up he's forgotten his phone.  We have to go back for his phone.  It turns out he hadn't forgotten his phone.  He'd forgotten another phone.  He had the phone on.  But then he's forgotten his key.  So now we have to wait for him to go and pick his keys up.  That was on the way here.  Absolutely.  A shambles.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  Sounds like a comedy of errors.  Honestly.  But he doesn't care.  He doesn't say sorry.  He just goes, oh, I don't know. 
[00:19:30]  I said sorry.  What do you mean I didn't say sorry?  I love my money.  I love my money.  Right?  That's how I talk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Honestly, you have never seen anyone so scared as him on this plane.  It is amazing.  I'm scared too.  But because he's more scared than me, I'm laughing thinking we're going to die.  And it was sweating.  It was bad turbulence.  It was.  He was trying to get drunk really quickly.  Yeah.  Just sweating.  And he filmed it.  That's right.  It was amazing.  Did you get sick?  All that bouncing around makes me nauseous.  I take drama on me when I fly.  The things he was shouting. 
[00:20:00]  He was shouting.  The most disgusting things in history, yeah.  Fuck your mother.  Put a frog on your cock and fuck your mother.  Hitler fucked his wife.  Ten-year-old gay kids.  Fuck me.  Being racist.  How does that help you, though?  How does that help you?  It takes me out of my fear.  So just being racist.  That's his happy place.  Really?  I didn't say anything racist.  You did.  I said babies with AIDS.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's much better.  That's racist.  No, that's racist because you know they're black.  You know what kind of guy is.  There he goes.  I can't. 
[00:20:30]  Of course it was.  Hey, talking funny on HBO.  April 22nd at night.  This will do us no good at all.  Ah, you never know.  Someone's listening to that.  An idiot abroad.  I just want to say that.  I love the fucking show.  We're trying to figure out Carl.  You've known him for a long time.  Some people say he's an improv guy.  No.  He is brilliant at whatever he does.  He's either brilliant at being stupid or you see that.  I love it.  It's great.  I love it.  He goes, uh...  His mind works really fast. 
[00:21:00]  Well, he thinks like a comic, but he thinks so completely like a comic because he looks at  the situation and it goes in and he says exactly what he's thinking and they're like honed  one-liners.  People think he's scripted.  People think that...  But there's something about it because you keep thinking when you watch the show that you're  going to reach a point where he's going to become self-aware, like the computer in Terminator  or whatever, and it's going to kill the comedy, but he doesn't.  He stays that one way.  But he's not stupid.  Does he understand he's a comic, though?  Does he understand he's funny?  Oh, no, he doesn't.  That's the weirdest thing about it. 
[00:21:30]  Well, sometimes.  Not when he's angry.  I think that rustling is just Louis just eating stuff out of a big bag like a fucking horse.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Was I bothering you?  Jesus Christ.  I mean, just no concession to the public at all.  Never ending.  People have taken time to listen to me.  But when he's working, I'm doing very well in my career.  Yeah, I won an award.  Yeah, I did.  I'm Louis C.K.  I am Louis C.K., and I did win an award.  Right.  And I crinkle the paper.  He just comes in because it's free shit. 
[00:22:00]  I'm sure.  I'm going to go on the radio that Jay won the water award.  And I don't even know who else was nominated.  Congratulations on the water award, by the way, Jay Moore.  Thank you, Opie.  It was a fucking bullshit show, and they gave me a bullshit award.  It fucking sucked balls.  Who the fuck is going to invite you back?  I don't care.  They're pretty worried, you fucking asses.  I don't care.  Hey, Brando snubbed the Oscars.  This is a Darwinist business.  This is a Darwinist business.  If this shit catches up to me, I will be gone.  Right.  As long as it's working, I don't care.  You're going to go with it.  But fuck it.  I don't care.  I want to go back to Carl for a second. 
[00:22:30]  So when he says something funny, and you laugh your balls off.  He's a normal guy.  But you see it in his eyes.  Like, he realizes he just made Ricky Gervais fucking laugh.  Um, well, yeah, he knows that.  I don't think he finds the things he's saying as funny as I do, because when he's saying  them, it's usually from a point of anger.  You know?  Yeah.  It's like he's so wound up when he says something, and you have to prod him and prod him.  And I'm doing it for my amusement.  Sure.  Um, and, uh, people seems like, a lot of people think it's bullying. 
[00:23:00]  Um, I don't see it that way at all.  It's not bullying.  It's not what mates do.  Even Carl says, he says, um, well, if they say it's bullying, they're not doing anything  about it.  You're giving him a good life.  Yeah, exactly.  He said, who's coming to my rescue?  No one's helping me.  Now, Machu Picchu was the last episode.  Most people have seen it by now.  He really didn't want to go the distance?  It was a lot.  It's been a long time.  And he's been away from the moment.  He climbs all the way up, if you know where Machu Picchu is.  And he sees it in the distance, and he calls up Ricky, or it might have been Steven.  Yeah.  He goes, I'm close enough.  I don't need to go any further.  I'm like, you're that close to an amazing place in the world. 
[00:23:30]  That's a good example of what that guy's like, is that he doesn't have the same values as  other people.  But it's almost like that part of scripted.  He doesn't need that the way anybody else would.  No, he doesn't need anything, though.  He doesn't need anything.  He doesn't know what he wants.  He really didn't feel like going any further at that point.  He's looking forward to being old.  He said that.  He said, I'm looking forward to being old.  He said, the old people are no trouble.  I said, what do you mean?  He said, well, you just sit in a chair in the street, and no one looks at you like you're  lazy.  That's an ambition for this man.  It's just great.  He's happy.  He's just happy, you know, doing his own little thing. 
[00:24:00]  Second season?  But he's sorted it out.  I think he's got it right.  I think he's absolutely got it right.  He sees the world.  Yeah, he's a Buddha of some kind.  He's great.  A lot of people spend a whole life to get to that Zen moment of just being wherever you  are, and he's born with it.  I love that.  You guys just shit on me for acting that way.  No, we thought it was great.  You live totally in the moment, Jay.  You're like a fucking dog.  We thought that was great.  Yeah, but you do that emotionally.  You do that in a negative, bad way.  Yeah.  Like a bad dog.  Bad dog. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  Bad dog.  Fair enough.  Like a dog sucking his own dick.  Like one of those dogs that makes him comfortable.  A dog that growls at somebody who just fed them.  I've never, ever seen that in my life.  A dog sucking his own dick.  I've never seen that.  I've never seen that in any documentary.  Let's get the YouTube off.  Let's get the YouTube off.  You're right.  Even though they can.  They lick their balls, but they can.  Go down.  This is the dog sucking his own dick right there.  Jay Moore.  It's good work.  It's a dog sucking his own dick. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, he's been on YouTube really a dog sucking his own dick.  It's a jet.  Suck their own dick.  With the gorillas walking up there.  It's there, Louie.  What were you going to say about Carl?  You said you loved the fact that he.  That he would go to Machu Picchu and look at it and go, fuck.  From a distance.  Yeah, I don't need to.  But he wasn't impressed by anything because he's uninfluenced by peer pressure.  He's a man that was never, ever bowed to any peer pressure ever.  He's sorted out what he wants and nothing will change that.  Were you surprised how well the show did?  Yeah.  It kicked ass.  Science channel, right?  I think people connected with him. 
[00:25:30]  I think, you know, I think they, everyone sort of knows someone like that.  They're just never on the telly.  Right.  And I think that was refreshing about it.  He's not a, he's not an actor.  He's not a presenter.  You knew what he was saying was the first thing that came into his head.  Sure.  And that's gold dust because you just don't get that.  Are you going to do a second season?  Yeah, he's doing one now.  He probably didn't want to.  No, well, we lied to him.  Really?  He'll never hear this.  He'll never hear this.  Does he care that he's famous now?  No, he hates it.  What kind of lie did you tell him?  Well, he picked, he picked his, um, well, the first ones happened, for example. 
[00:26:00]  Um, I've, again, there's a thing on YouTube, um, where he leaves a message on my phone and,  um, uh, he, he picked, it's, um, things to do before you die.  And one of the things he picked was see a whale.  So we sent him to Alaska and we got him a boat, but he didn't know it was a working fishing boat.  So once he was out there, he was fucked.  And they wouldn't turn around.  And it's like minus 20.  And he leaves this message at six in the morning going, you fucking cunt won't turn around.  He's fucking, I'm not fucking doing the rest. 
[00:26:30]  You fuck.  He's going mental.  And I just, I put it on YouTube.  He's got another six to do.  I can't.  Sign the contract.  All we have to do is that once he's signed up, then he's, in fact, he can't give the money back.  Right.  So he's got to do it now.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  It is just like the best practical joke.  Wow.  Ever.  Yeah.  And he's, um, he's picking things to do before you die.  And that's, and that's it really, which he didn't understand.  He, he, I remember explaining things to do before you die.  And he said, well, why would I want to do that if I'm dying?  I went, no, it doesn't mean you're dying.  They don't, they don't get a sick kid when he's got a week to live and throw him in with some dolphins. 
[00:27:00]  It doesn't mean that I'm going to get me back to the life support machine.  He thought that was it.  That's the thing.  Just before you die, you get chucked in with some dolphins or something.  But he's, yeah, he's, he's quite incredible.  But I mean, I think he's, I sort of think he's a genius as well.  Genuinely.  He's a savant.  Yeah.  I wonder if anybody ever has a dying end.  He deconstructs.  He looks at someone and he deconstructs it and he brings it down to its, its, its rawest nub.  And you can't argue with it.  He just, you just.  Is it a, is it a form of autism? 
[00:27:30]  I can't ask.  No, he's not.  He's a, he's normally smart.  He's make stuff.  He's good with his hands.  Yeah.  He's, you know.  So is Carl in Sling Blade.  Yeah.  But you see.  You just described an autistic kid.  He's good with his hands.  But it's also the way, like, people used to be before they were cluttered with a bunch  of extra shit to think of.  Yeah.  And he's not thinking about that.  He's thinking, like, really precise, like a person alive, you know?  But he says things like knowledge is hassle. 
[00:28:00]  He said you don't need all this stuff.  You know, he's got.  Well, you really don't.  No, I know.  I mean, you don't want to live a life.  But yeah, I think he's smart.  You don't need to know all this shit.  I think he's got emotional intelligence beyond most people.  I think he's highly intelligent.  Yeah.  I think, I really think he is.  And he is funny.  I mean, he's hilarious.  And he laughs sometimes.  People have never seen him laugh because, as I say, usually when we film it, we're doing  all, you know, a podcast.  I've wound him up so much that he's just so angry.  It's like, I suppose he's like Rain Man, but without any of the clever shit and Tom Cruise 
[00:28:30]  just winding him up all the time.  All right, he's autistic, Ronnie.  He's not.  He's autistic.  Do you think I'm a bit like Tom Cruise?  What?  Of the two, of the two, of Rain Man and Tom Cruise, I'm more like Tom Cruise, aren't I?  Why would you say that?  Why would that?  Based on what?  Just.  And I like that the other guy is.  Rain Man.  That's the Hoffman.  Tom Cruise, give him his real name.  The other guy, Rain Man, he never did anything again. 
[00:29:00]  You're like Tom Cruise based on the rumors about your sexuality.  That's right.  That's right.  You're like Tom Cruise.  Get it?  This is surely libelous now.  This is surely libelous now.  Do you care?  No, man, we're just going with it.  We're going to fucking air this whole thing, too.  What about the office there, Ricky?  Yeah, what about that?  You're getting your feet wet with the American office.  Yeah, well, I was just popping up for a laugh.  I remember years ago, you were like, you were staying away.  Now you've kind of taken a peek.  Well, we were staying away for a very good reason, that we thought that it should be made 
[00:29:30]  by Americans for Americans.  You know, I worked in an office for seven years, and we made that, and the attention to detail  was, I think, what made the office good.  And then, what's the point in doing a remake and doing it again?  It just didn't seem...  I mean, originally, they wanted me to play the David Brent character, and I thought, what's  the point of that?  I just could have kept mine going.  But once it's on its own, sort of two feet, I'm just doing it for fun, really.  It's a little...  What if they come to you and go, five million an episode?  That's what I got.  I got five million.  Dollars, though. 
[00:30:00]  So, yeah.  But it was good.  You know, like, who was that bloke?  He's dead now.  Marlon Brando.  Didn't he get a million pounds for that cameo in, like, the early...  Superman.  Yeah.  When he was Superman, he just walked out, handed him a bag of money, and he left.  They actually gave him the money in the fucking scene, where he looked into it.  Yeah, and they worked into the scene, said, all right, it's here.  Actually, Chuck Berry has done the same thing.  Oh, he waits.  Yeah, you've got to have cash for him.  Yeah, there's a bunch of million-dollar guys.  There's a bunch of guys.  Chuck's not one of them. 
[00:30:30]  He's a nine-grand guy, not anymore.  But whenever you pay him, you've got to give it to him that second.  In the guitar case, next to the pistol.  He actually will unplug, put the guitar place in.  He's got a bunch of things.  He also wants a red Cadillac rented for him, waiting for him at the airport.  That's one of those things that probably isn't true.  He wants a ham sandwich before he goes on.  His agent, or whoever, has to be backstage with the money, so he can see it while he's  on stage.  He does.  Yes, it is true.  And I actually saw him, because he'll just use local guys.  He uses local guys to play with them, too, that he hasn't practiced with. 
[00:31:00]  And then he walks out, plugs in while they're there.  They're playing.  They keep on playing.  He looks at his watch.  It could be like, fuck it, I'm done.  It's like 35 minutes.  Yeah, 35 minutes, and he's gone.  And they say, what are we playing?  He says, we're playing Chuck Berry songs.  Yeah.  And he just goes, man, it's the same song, I guess, 14 times.  Just keep doing it.  But everybody will end up there.  It'll be Louie one day.  It'll be just the same thing.  Louie's got a great attitude to money.  I think he says it in Talking Fire. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know if we left it in.  We're talking about when Chris is saying, you're the blackest white guy ever.  Yeah.  Countdown to poverty.  Yeah, how black people, when they get, Chris's old bit about how when white people are rich,  they're rich, and their kids are rich, and their grandkids.  But when a black guy gets rich, it's countdown to when he's poor again.  But that's what it's like for me, yeah.  But you said you don't see it as your money, you see it as the money.  Yeah, it's the money.  It's an element.  It's like oxygen.  That's great.  It's not right to hoard it around you. 
[00:32:00]  You've got to keep circulating it back out into the system.  So you earn money and you spend it.  I spend it right out my asshole.  I just buy shit.  What'd you buy today?  Nothing.  It's early.  It's only fucking 10.30 in the morning.  You buy gold, though.  That's smart.  Yeah, I bought some gold coins.  Gold things, smart.  Yeah.  I love it.  I don't know.  I did.  You could pay Louie in three magic beans.  Yeah.  And he'd be happy.  I've got a bunch of gold coins. 
[00:32:30]  They were about 900 bucks when I bought them.  They're an ounce each.  And they're now worth 1,500.  Oh, so this is true.  You really did buy some gold coins.  Yeah.  I've been to the gold store.  What did you do that?  There were gold bullion coins.  What were you thinking?  I had cash.  I got paid in cash for it.  So you went out and bought some gold coins.  I got some gold coins.  You did.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  And they went from 900 to 1,500 bucks each.  That's a pretty good profit.  It's just a weird purchase, though.  What else did you get?  A horse and a slave?  It's strange. 
[00:33:00]  That is weird.  Did you do it as an investment, or did you think, I wonder if this will work?  What do you mean, if it'll work?  Did you do it as an investment, thinking, I wonder if I can make money of this?  Or was it a little way more?  I just wanted some gold coins.  It was shiny.  And I also knew that gold keeps going up.  It always goes up.  How do you know they're real, though?  How do you know that it's honestly 100% legit?  Is there American mint?  There are U.S. eagles or Canadian maple?  What do you think of this as an idea?  Yeah, I want to do Idiot Abroad 3.  You bite it.  You bite the coin.  I want Carl to do this.  Carl's going to do it, we think, right? 
[00:33:30]  We're not sure yet.  But it's called Fool's Gold.  I give him a million pounds, and he's got to spend every pound once, and he's got to  make another million.  And he thinks it's easy.  He thinks it's easy?  He's got a year.  I'll give him a million pounds, and he's got to spend it all, and make two million.  So make one million pounds.  So we invest, he has to buy things that would...  He's got to figure some shit out.  And I said, what would you do?  He said, first thing, he said, buy some scratch cards.  He said 5,000.  That was his first thing to do. 
[00:34:00]  5,000 scratch cards.  So $5,000 goes to scratch cards.  Yeah, and then he's just scratching.  That's not terrible.  That's not terrible.  That's not terrible.  That's great.  If he gets a few 20s in there, a few 40s, you know, scratch cards, you can make a few  hundred bucks once in a while, yeah.  Yeah.  But here's the thing.  If he wins, say $50, they'll say, do you want $50, or do you want me to give you 50  more scratch cards?  Yeah.  That's a mistake everyone makes.  That's how they get you.  Yep.  I always take them once.  When I was going, I forgot to buy my family presents, and I went down, and I got them all 
[00:34:30]  like 10 scratch cards each.  You forgot to buy your family presents?  Yeah, yeah.  When I was late, I was going, yeah.  And the kids, there was like nieces and nephews, like 10 years old, you know, winning a fiver,  and then going down the shop again.  From like the smoked cigarette shop?  Yeah, exactly.  They're addicted now.  The smoked cigarette shop.  Yeah, the smoked cigarette shop.  Whatever the fucking English fucking retards call it.  Whatever these fucking worthless fucking people call their version of it.  How many people did he offend in that English fucking retards? 
[00:35:00]  Two, two, exactly.  Really, one.  They're all over there.  Oh, jeez.  Every retarded person is in England.  It's true.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I can't wait to watch Talking Funny, that's for sure.  You picked the right guys, too, there, Ricky.  HBO, 9 o'clock, April 22nd.  I just want to keep getting that plug out there.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Were you intimidated talking to, I mean, not on a personal level, because you know  Louie and you know Seinfeld, but you're talking comedy and stand-up. 
[00:35:30]  But Chris Rock, because he's black, maybe you're intimidated.  I was trying not to say that, but it is what I meant.  And then he might steal something.  No, but with three great comedians like that.  Yeah.  I mean, you're talking stand-up with three guys who are legitimately great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was really.  All you're thinking then is, I don't want to be the least funny person in the room.  I was.  But then I get the back end.  No, but I loved hearing you talk about your fucking doing a new act every year. 
[00:36:00]  Why do you curse so much?  Because it just makes me sound like people listen more when you curse.  I'm insecure about what I'm saying, so I say, fuck, and people like this guy's got secret.  I liked it.  I liked it.  He's great.  I love this guy, honestly.  One of the most honest people.  I know.  I love his face.  I like the way he talks.  I like his fashion.  It's the first time that's ever been said.  Yeah.  How can you not like that face?  He's great.  Jim is lovable.  Thank you very much.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, well, now the pressure's on me.  I'm just going to start fucking bombing.  Right.  To be honest.  Never notice me.  If you don't notice me, I kill. 
[00:36:30]  I remember Louie ruined your act once.  He made me laugh.  He said something to me when you were on stage and you heard it.  No, that wasn't.  What happened?  Please don't tell me you're confusing me with that fucking buffoon Bob Kelly.  No, no.  Yeah, no, man.  You are.  Really?  Yeah, because Bob was on stage.  He's confusing me with Bob Kelly.  Bob was on stage.  I was on stage and you were in the room and I was in there with you.  The Comedy Center, thanks. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, and I said something to you and you laughed and Bob got excited because he thought  you laughed at his ass.  Yeah.  But you weren't even listening.  I was distracting you.  I thought that was you.  No.  Thank God you're wrong.  Were you on that night?  I was, but you were, I think you weren't there when I went on.  Because I remember seeing you outside.  It was a great comic.  We talked.  Yeah, maybe that's the confusion.  It was a great comic.  Thank you.  No, I know.  I have seen you.  I'm happy to be confused with Bob.  That's like somebody saying, like, hey, was that you in the yard?  Oh, sorry, that was dog shit.  I stepped in.  Your stage name is Carrot Top. 
[00:37:30]  Yes, it is.  I have a lot of funny toys I pull out.  I used to hit a watermelon.  I was kind of him, too.  I was kind of him, too.  Did he die?  Are you going to have a heart attack on stage?  He works at the smoking cigarettes shop.  And he has to sell his house now.  Oh, really?  Because he had a heart attack?  I don't know.  He's going to live in a van like the wrestler?  We learned that he day trades in between radio interviews, so I guess he wasn't good  at that.  He day trades?  Yeah.  He's back to his brother, and his brother toured as Gallagher 2.  No, I remember that.  Yeah, we know all... 
[00:38:00]  But he's...  But he's...  After the interview, he hangs out the entire day at the radio station in day trades.  That's very strange.  He just sits in the hallway.  I sat with him for an hour.  Buy gold coins.  Buy gold coins.  That's the way to go.  I've never been buying gold coins.  That's great.  It is.  I just can't imagine it.  Just imagine you going in that hour to destroy your breakfast all over you, and you've got  a big one of cash, and I go, good morning, sir.  How much is that?  Yes, that's the way it works.  Well, if the economy crashes, why would gold be worth anything? 
[00:38:30]  I mean, I guess...  Gold always runs up against depression.  But I guess at one point, like, oh, here's something shiny, this is great, but now human  beings have, you know, television.  Yeah, but gold keeps going up.  But it's perfect, isn't it?  Because it's finite.  So they know you cannot make it.  And that's it?  And you can't get it from anywhere else.  The first time I ever bought...  I bought gold coins when I was...  Like, I don't know, in the late 80s once.  This is so weird!  And they were 300 bucks an ounce.  300 bucks an ounce was gold. 
[00:39:00]  Now it's $1,500 an ounce.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, it's gone...  It just screams upward more than anything else.  Actually, well, that's really not that much.  But it's running the same as Coke.  It's running the same as Coke.  Yeah, but no other...  No other stock is like that, you know?  Sure it is.  That's a huge...  That's a good point.  Why does it go up?  Yeah, it's insane, because you can see, like, if you were a caveman, like, oh, it's shiny.  But now, if everything goes...  If there's no water to drink, nobody's going to give a shit that you're holding gold, right?  That was the best radio face in history, by the way. 
[00:39:30]  No one will get that.  If there's no water to drink, I'm not going to worry about my gold coins and how much  they...  Fuck, my coins are worth shit.  I'm going to die with worthless gold coins.  I can picture you obsessing.  There's no water.  That's going to be what I'm worried about.  My daughters are skeletons, and I'm worried about my gold coins.  It just seems like if you have gold coins, they're going to die with you, because you'll  never...  You're not going to be a sell-down with some gold coins and a pirate hat next to you.  That's what I think.  Now, gold has... 
[00:40:00]  Do they move it around?  You know, when it's against, like, stocks or shares, or one country gives another country  20 trillion billion dollars?  Is that gold move somewhere?  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it.  Fort Knox has this massive gold reserve in it, but no one...  It might not exist.  No one goes and looks at it.  No one goes and makes sure it's in there.  Have you seen it?  I just wanted to be a part of it.  It felt good to jump in and have the floor for a second.  That Bob Kelly is amazing.  Yeah, he's terrific. 
[00:40:30]  I got tire tracks in my back.  Roddy ran right over me for the punchline.  Well, our money used to be on the gold standard.  That's what the pounds are, and you're pounds sterling.  It used to be when we used to have...  American dollars, really old ones are called silver certificates.  But there must be a movement of gold, though, because otherwise, you could say to another  country, we'll buy this and give them money that doesn't exist.  There must be something to show for it.  There must be some sort of token.  How many stones did you lose? 
[00:41:00]  How many stones?  It's not with an S, right?  Yeah, I thought...  Almost a stone.  It's about 22 pounds.  Atta boy.  But, you know...  Yeah, thanks.  You lost a lot more than 22 pounds.  You'll edit out everything that's happened between those two statements.  How much you did at 22 pounds?  I go, thanks.  Talking Funny is on the 22nd of April.  Oh, they won't plug that.  No.  That'd be cut.  No.  Stories about your friends.  No, it's just not like radio.  It's just like hanging out.  Well, that's how we try to do our show, Rick. 
[00:41:30]  It's the best way to do it.  Hearing Seinfeld, you said something interesting about how comedy is empathy.  And I thought, wow, he's right.  And then Seinfeld goes, no, it's not.  No, it's just jokes.  And then I was like, fuck, that's actually a good point by Seinfeld.  I don't know.  I think it is empathy.  I think you have to like someone.  I think you have to understand what they're saying.  I think everything has to be personified.  You can't make jokes about the inanimate.  But he was saying you are above the audience.  About the what?  About the inanimate.  Inanimate?  Inanimate. 
[00:42:00]  Something that has no...  I didn't hear the T at the end.  All right, sorry.  Maybe to laugh at somebody, you have to like them.  But Seinfeld is weird.  He doesn't really fit into...  Every comic has something wrong with them that I know.  Like they're sex addicts or drug addicts or gamblers.  And with him, I can't figure out what his fucking psychosis or problem is.  We'll find out after he dies, it'll all come out.  It certainly will.  His computer will be open.  So we've got one.  I don't buy that, that you have to be...  You have to, you know, have visibly something wrong with you.  I think you have to be aware of your inanimate choices and plan on them.  But I don't think you have to wear it on your sleeve.  Not necessarily, but every comic I know has something wrong with them. 
[00:42:30]  They don't even necessarily...  Hold on, I'm having a pissing match here.  They don't have to wear it on their sleeve, but they actually all have something.  Seinfeld said you have to be above the audience?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, he said, no, he said...  That's what Bob said.  No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.  That's what I said.  Catch a coffee.  That's what I said.  Boom, you need some money.  No, what he was saying, I was saying that you can't be above the audience.  You have to sort of fall over for their pleasure.  In a way, you have to put yourself below the audience.  Show them you've had a worse day than them. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  To be funny.  He was saying, but you're already, you're already above them because you've got the mic.  They're all looking at you.  You're the only one talking.  Right.  I thought it was, I think it was...  Well, Jerry also, he doesn't look at, I mean, you have this really humane version of comedy  and it comes from sort of like Laurel and Hardy and Chaplin and stuff.  Yeah, the best call.  But he, Jerry is a technician.  He's about the jokes.  Jerry looks at comedy like music.  Like he used to tell me he was like playing a horn.  It's dots on paper, yeah.  He just likes to get, he gets off on the material. 
[00:43:30]  What's the deal?  He gets off heavily on the material and how he does it.  And he is, you know, when I was young, I used to open for Jerry.  When I was like 18, 19, I got to open for him in one gig in Boston and he liked me.  So he took me to a bunch and it was an enormous experience because I kind of didn't think when I was that age, like he wasn't my favorite guy.  I liked Stephen Wright and I liked Carlin and Pryor.  And I thought he was good, but I didn't really know of him that much.  But watching him do, you know, hour-long shows and theaters. 
[00:44:00]  And this is before he had his show, when he was just a top-ranked, heavyweight comic.  Watching him do that, the fucking guy is a virtuoso.  He is like a great, like Vladimir Horowitz.  He's a fucking genius at putting on a comedy show.  He works so hard for his audience.  Yeah, he does, yeah.  But he's also, he's almost professorial about it as well.  He's got everything worked out.  He's in control.  He's very much into being in control.  And we identified that too on the show, that like he's, like when he did my joke about the vacation going around the car, 
[00:44:30]  he did it in this very controlled, Sonfeldian way.  That's my vacation.  What I was saying, that Louie's, he's angry.  We're laughing at him because he can't get it out.  We're laughing at the human aspect of him.  I'm sweating and I'm sputtering.  I mean, they're there.  They're all there.  They're all sort of disguised and hidden.  But we're laughing at a man's breakdown.  We're feeling it more viscerally.  We're not looking at the dots on paper. 
[00:45:00]  And I think that a lot with comedians, when you see the comedians,  and they can be great one-line puns, but you feel that you haven't learned about them.  You feel that you could read them out yourself and get just as good a laugh.  Well, there's almost no right answer.  That's what I, it's like, when you look at Pryor and Carlin,  and I think they're the two greatest, and they were completely different.  Pryor was extraordinarily personal.  Carlin told you nothing personal, but was still an observational genius and a social genius.  And Pryor was too, but he did it through a person.  They both took different vehicles to get to the same place.  Well, also, Carlin did bits, and he worked them out. 
[00:45:30]  He had really well-phrased stuff.  And Pryor would just talk.  Pryor would just talk and talk, and he would hit beautiful moments that you know were precise for him.  But Carlin said he really turned the corner when he said,  he used to say, I'm a comedian that writes his own material.  And then he started saying, I'm a writer who performs his own material.  And he realized he was writing essays, and he was doing a one-man show in like four pieces.  Yeah.  Like a bit about Earth, and he would just do a one-man show. 
[00:46:00]  That's right.  I tried to do that when I started off.  It's too hard.  Yeah.  It's too hard.  So now I just get bits, and I pretend to work them together.  You had the best quote in Esquire, and you said, Laurel and Hardy is like, the basic  root of comedy is Laurel and Hardy.  It's never been improved upon.  I'd be so much better off if I wasn't with this idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  You just can't improve that.  No, and that's what it's about as well.  Ever since you said that, they just started showing it on these bizarre channels, and  I watch it, and I go, fucking Ricky Gervis.  But it's even deeper than that, because it's like the blind leading the blind. 
[00:46:30]  And they both think they'd be better off than the other one, and one is more stupid than  the other one, because he thinks he's cleverer than the other one.  I have nothing to say to you.  It's just lovely.  It's just lovely.  It's just great.  And see, Louis, Louis' stand-up, I think, is good, because he's really sort of like a  threat, because he shambles out like an underdog, whose life's falling apart, but then he's  really clever, and his targets are all correct.  Even though they don't look like they are, they're all correct targets. 
[00:47:00]  He goes after people.  Like retards fucking in England?  Well, you know, that's what you say about being above it, or I'm hung up on the, you  know, empathetic.  So are you, though.  The jokes you make, they're clearly, actually, if they look cruel, they're not.  They're not at all.  Yeah, no, I mean, I think people know that I'm being an asshole.  Of course.  I don't mind people thinking I'm an asshole.  Yeah, but they get it.  They get it on a subliminal level, because they know you can't be.  But I don't know anyone that thinks you are. 
[00:47:30]  What's that?  I don't know a single human being that thinks you're an asshole.  Oh, there are definitely people.  I don't know anyone.  I've never met anyone.  Not the people that go to your show.  When you say it, they go, oh, Louie's hilarious.  Or like, if I said it, I would not have a job.  I mean, it's like when I do, there's things I do on my show where I take on certain subjects,  and the one way I've managed, when I'm doing something that's kind of controversial, what  I do is I make sure that I lose.  Yeah, because you're fighting, but whenever you're angry, you're the rape victim.  And you're always fighting an unreasonable world. 
[00:48:00]  You're fighting with what, you know, the hand you would doubt.  And also, I like the fact you also start off, and I don't know if you do this consciously  or not, but people like you because you're bringing up two little girls.  So they know whatever you're doing, you're bringing up two little girls.  And I think that, and I think people have got to like you.  Here's an example.  The Marx Brothers, right?  They're the biggest things in Florida.  You don't have children, right?  No.  I don't know what that means. 
[00:48:30]  I don't know what the hmm means.  The Marx Brothers, funny, everyone loved them doing stuff, right?  They transferred the films, and it's sort of exhausting, okay?  It's too long to be doing insane stuff.  So the eventual producer-director of the best films, they came and said,  listen, I can make you so much bigger.  And he said, we're putting a musical number, and we're putting a love story.  So now, it's these idiots, right?  But they're being idiotic and running around because they're trying to get two lovers together.  So now everyone wants them to win because they're doing something worthwhile with their stupidity. 
[00:49:00]  You know what, though?  I hate those Marx Brothers movies.  I like the earlier ones, when they're just being fucking nuts.  I've got to agree with Louis on this because he won the award last night.  It's strange.  When they do that, and I think I'm in the minority.  It's an award-winning opinion.  That's right.  I was given an award for having this opinion.  No, I think it's the humanity again, because Groucho is always the underdog.  Even though he thinks he's cleverer than that guy, he's getting conned.  He looks at the guy, you know?  No, no, that's what they were like.  But when they put in the couples and had them sing to each other, and the Marx Brothers  became like a B story, those love stories were synthetic, horseshit, bad Hollywood love stories. 
[00:49:30]  As opposed to the Marx Brothers act?  The great Marx Brothers movies, like Animal Crackers, that were just fucking crazy stories  that made no sense, but that were driven by this great comedy that they did.  But you need the division, because it's exhausting.  Even, you know, like you're, okay, you can come out, and I can watch you for an hour telling me a story.  That's the human aspect.  You can tell a story, and I can watch you for an hour, right? 
[00:50:00]  If you come out and you do the best thousand one-liners, I'm looking at my watch after 20 minutes.  Yeah, no, when you purify comedy into just a fastball.  But, you know, there are guys, I think it's just everybody's just different.  You can't, you know, there's some people who are empathetic and personal,  and there's other people who just got the fucking jokes.  After No Filter, his album's going to be, everybody's just different.  Everybody's just different.  Yeah, but the same underneath, if you turn it over. 
[00:50:30]  And it's just him, the leading by his head.  Leading on his hands.  Put the same underneath.  That'll be the album.  Everybody's just different, and I'm wearing, like, a leather jacket with the collar up,  like Dennis Leary in the 80s.  And then on the other side, but the same underneath, folded hands.  I was, I'll get you to tell some of the stories you told on Talking Funny,  but that would ruin it, wouldn't it?  I don't remember any of what I told them.  You told the best anecdotes.  I don't remember.  You were great, man.  You were really good.  It was a fun day.  It was a show going to be on television. 
[00:51:00]  I saw Seinfeld.  It was a thrill to me.  It was, with more respect.  As it, that four hours went, I saw Seinfeld looking over at you more and more,  thinking, this guy's good.  Well, Jerry, you know, he used to kind of haze me a lot,  because we knew each other when I was fucking 18.  I was writing new material.  Why do you keep getting bigger when I'm sort of the same as I was before?  Have you ever known his socks?  You gotta change.  I want my feet not to have shoes, but I need something between me and the floor.  I have enormous, like, awe, respect for Jerry and Chris and you. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, when I saw The Office, when I first said it, I wouldn't have said it.  You think I felt like I had to?  I would have fucking loved if I didn't feel it inside.  Then you would have seen how those things hurt.  How fun that would have been to say I had enormous respect for Jerry and Chris,  and then just watch your eyes kind of notice it.  I would have loved that.  I can't do it.  Or you could have just said Jerry, Chris, and Bob Kelly and humiliated me, too.  How smart is Jerry, though, that he's the one that got Larry David 
[00:52:00]  in the middle of all the comedy boom and all?  He was the one that, oh, I created a show with Larry David,  which was, Larry, you're right, and I'll do my acting.  And Larry couldn't get arrested back then.  But to be able to recognize that, to be able to get that.  But do you know, would you sound like you know that Larry did more of the,  the heavy lifting?  No, I think he, the stuff that he wrote, he wrote all the...  Seinfeld was all Larry.  I can tell that.  I assumed it was...  Oh, you could tell. 
[00:52:30]  Well, I mean, Jerry, Jerry.  Now that we know who Larry is.  It came from Jerry's...  Who asked you?  Oh, sorry.  Why don't you shut your fucking mouth?  I'm sorry.  What the fuck?  This is exactly like The View.  I'm just kidding.  Whenever I'm talking, the father says,  what the fuck are you talking?  Well, we say this show is kind of like the inmates run the asylum.  That's the curb.  Yeah, it's crazy.  It's like an upside down.  It is like an experiment.  It does feel like I'm part of an experiment.  Then you're going to go out and you're going to fucking rape and shit.  Yeah, we should leave a sign on the door or something. 
[00:53:00]  Rape is not an experiment.  It's a proven...  It's pretty well perfected at this point.  What's that?  Rape.  Oh, it certainly is.  Wait, I mean, you shouldn't do it, but it works perfectly.  Yeah.  You do.  Somebody's not minding their P's and Q's.  I think with that, we should get out of here.  When is this program on television?  Always end on a rape gag.  Yeah, he's got it.  Every time.  Rule one.  Rule one.  Bob Hope.  Oh, Bob Hope used to leave the troops.  Bob Hope did the rape joke.  Yeah.  I always lean with a rape joke.  But if he wouldn't win the Oscar.  Fine-looking troops. 
[00:53:30]  Rape, rape, rape.  Yeah.  He might have won the Oscar.  But he didn't win the Comedy Central Award, did he?  Oh, that's true.  That's true.  Yeah, Louis.  That's right.  Thank you.  Louis.  Thank you.  You beat out Ricky and Whitney Cummings.  They don't let you keep the fucking award.  Who's the fucking fourth person you beat?  No.  They took the thing.  They took the thing from you.  You never told us what that thing was.  That's so they can engrave it.  You came off.  They told me I won it a month before.  When did they fucking.  On the award show, they couldn't just hand it that says, hi, here, Louis.  Everybody got the same one. 
[00:54:00]  I'm sure no one's getting it.  What does it look like?  You never told us.  It's a microphone on a black thing.  Yeah.  Stupid.  It's a fucking microphone.  Terrible.  And you're never getting that award.  It's a fucking terrible award.  Because it was a bust.  Nobody cared about it.  It's just a prop.  So I swear they're going to go, why are we going to engrave them?  Do you know why I like winning awards?  Because I know there's loads of people out there that hate me even more for it and think  I shouldn't have won it.  And that gives me a bigger buzz than the people who go, well done.  I know there's someone somewhere in an apartment going, I fucking hate him.  He shouldn't have fucking won it. 
[00:54:30]  Here's the thing, too.  We don't know.  Oh, this could be big, and he's like Wings of Desire.  He won the first year.  No one, no.  Those guys didn't show up.  They went, I don't give a shit.  Some stupid thing.  And now you were there for the first.  But I like to think that my special that didn't win is like Citizen Kane not winning.  That's true, and people will talk about that years from now.  You'd like to think that.  You'd like to think that.  Raging bull with your little fucking flesh-colored microphone on your face.  Your fucking headset microphone that's flesh-colored. 
[00:55:00]  And now Colin has one.  I was wondering, he doesn't hold the microphone, he's no real stand-up.  He doesn't hold it with one hand.  That's right.  That's right.  Take this shitty thing out of your voice, and it's correct.  He's not really a stand-up.  He doesn't hold it with his hand.  I saw you.  It was actually impressive.  I thought you were just talking really loud for a while.  Yeah.  Wow, this guy's good.  Really, yeah.  You're a great performer, man.  I watched you at the Paramount, I think.  Ricky's great.  I very rarely go to see stand-ups.  But it was a very impressive show.  It was fucking great. 
[00:55:30]  Thank you very much.  Let's end on that, surely.  Yeah.  That's the quote.  I met Louis.  It's great patience on stage.  Ricky has the...  Ricky invests in little moments on stage.  That's a hard thing to do.  I deserve more than it got.  With that, Ricky, thanks so much.  Do you really like me, or is it really Bob Kelly we're thinking of?  No, I did like you.  Thank you.  I got confused, because I wasn't watching him.  Oh, jeez.  It wasn't, obviously, because he was making me laugh.  I remember talking to you that night.  It was a little hurt.  I'm sure I've seen you as well.  No, I think you were great.  Probably on HBO or whatever. 
[00:56:00]  I like your style.  It's like I've said.  I like the fact that it's visceral, and it's angry, and it's just not about that.  Do you remember one joke he did?  No.  That's the beauty of it.  Whenever you see a great show, you don't remember the jokes.  You just remember the feeling of being elevated that you experience, as opposed to my fucking  nonsensical joke.  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  You're not dying, Ricky.  You're killing everyone around you.  He had a big bag of props, and he got them out.  He did different jokes on every single one of them.  And none of it was planned.  He was just cutting them out of the audience.  Yeah, it was like they just filled my prop bag, and I'm like, oh, what is this? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Improv.  Oh.  All right, we've got to get Ricky out of here.  Come back with Carl, will you?  Yeah, well, no.  For the second season, can you bring Carl next time?  I think you should get Carl on and just ask him questions for an hour to show that he's  a real thing.  And get people to phone in.  All right, we'll set that up.  We'll get Carl on.  Ricky Gervais, thanks.  Talking Funny, I think everyone's going to check it out.  April 22nd at 9 p.m. on HBO.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure, sir.  We'll see you soon.  Bye, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
