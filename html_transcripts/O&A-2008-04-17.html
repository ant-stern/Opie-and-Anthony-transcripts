<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heavily critical replay of a disastrous, nearly hour-long phone call with Nick's mother from Australia. The hosts, Opie and Anthony, repeatedly labeled her "annoying" and "stupid," detailing their struggles to control the conversation. Nick later called in to apologize, attributing his mother's behavior to intoxication.  The show then tackled a listener's 9/11 conspiracy theories, which were swiftly dismissed. A substantial portion focused on Barack Obama's presidential campaign and Bruce Springsteen's endorsement, sparking a debate on the impact of celebrity endorsements. One caller admitted Springsteen's endorsement swayed his vote from McCain to Obama.  Leslie Nielsen was mentioned as a previous guest.  "Club Soda Kenny," responsible for traffic and weather, became a recurring point of frustration due to his lateness, inappropriate timing, and darkly humorous commentary. The hosts promoted a YouTube video, "Remove Your Hat," and encouraged a Google bomb to increase its visibility.  They also shared "Pope Facts" and discussed a seemingly coincidental news story linking a Mets home run to the Pope's US visit.  The microphone falling repeatedly became a running gag, punctuated by frequent interruptions and crude humor.

The show continued with another discussion about Club Soda Kenny's inconsistent traffic and weather reports. This transitioned into a brief comedic skit featuring fictional gangster characters: Muggsy, Rocky, Max, and G.H.  A news station's blunder – a graphic of "church abuse victim" appearing under a child discussing the Pope's visit – led to criticism of the Pope's public image.  The hosts then discussed two revenge stories involving exes: a woman using a YouTube video for divorce leverage and a man distributing flyers announcing his ex's herpes diagnosis.  This prompted a discussion about their own experiences with exes, including a detailed recounting of one host's vindictive act involving recordings of his ex having sex with another man.  Unexpectedly, actor Willem Dafoe appeared in the studio. The interview covered his career, views on the film industry, and experiences with intense scenes and film critics. The hosts asked Dafoe about a male kissing scene and his work with Madonna, causing his publicist to become visibly upset. After Dafoe's departure, the hosts justified their questions and discussed their experiences with Hollywood publicists.

The next segment featured a prolonged and profane impersonation of Vince McMahon, portraying him as a boastful, blasphemous, self-proclaimed god.  The bit involved ludicrous claims, insults towards religious figures, and proposed wrestling matches involving biblical figures.  Club Soda Kenny delivered another darkly humorous traffic and weather report, filled with descriptions of accidents and fatalities.  Jim Norton was a studio guest who left to record for Good Morning America.  The hosts discussed Brother Wee's participation in a contest, a listener's Disney World wedding, and Morgan Spurlock's documentary, highlighting Spurlock’s encounters with hostile Hasidic Jews.  The segment concluded with interns Tony and Pat Duffy attempting a radio show intro, which the hosts humorously critiqued.

A recurring bit involved Pat Duff and Steve ("Steve the Bear" and "wfag") attempting a radio intro for the song "Disturbed Voices" by Disturbed.  Their inexperience and flubs provided comedic fodder.  E-Rock ("Sex Bagel") was brought in to contrast their performance with that of a seasoned professional.  A discussion ensued between Opie, Anthony, Pat Duff, and Tony, focusing on Tony's criticism of Pat Duff's work. Tony mentioned being deemed "overqualified" for a radio job. He shared some prepared bits, including one about a tasered man. Pat Duff's broadcasting school demo was played, revealing more humorous mishaps and borrowed material.  The segment ended with discussion of a potential staff radio show project.  Roland ("Chongo") and Morgan Spurlock were also mentioned.

This was followed by a highly vulgar bit mimicking Casey Kasem introducing the band Anal Cunt, featuring extremely offensive language and a listener's request for their song "Recycling is Gay." The conversation shifted to past experiences playing music festivals with Anal Cunt, Murphy's Law, and Motorhead.  Opie launched into an angry rant about not receiving a bonus. Brother Joe called in briefly. Morgan Spurlock's lateness dominated a significant portion as the hosts discussed his movie and experiences filming in the Middle East, including encounters with the military and a humorous incident involving a rocket launcher.  Jay Moore then called in, discussing his roles in movies, including "Street Kings," and sharing anecdotes about Keanu Reeves. The call ended abruptly.

The final segment included an interview with Morgan Spurlock.  He recounted anecdotes from filming "Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden?", including a humorous story about Afghan police officers and aphrodisiacs. He discussed the challenges of filming in tribal areas, his political leanings, and his upcoming TV show and movie ideas.  The conversation included details of his wife's home birth and the messy aftermath.  The show concluded with the "Line of the Day" segment, promotional mentions for AshleyMadison.com, and expletive-laden outbursts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony show.  All you do.  You should play drunk or stroke.  Okay, so Opie and Anthony.  My first time sort of touching a woman.  I don't know what words were you used.  First time you picked a girl's nose, what happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up, 
[00:01:00]  and the dog runs over, and he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going?  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on O.P. and Anthony?  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  Unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is it time to broadcast already? 
[00:01:30]  Certainly is.  The clock's missing.  How can we do a show?  My clock's right there.  Now I've got to spin around and look?  You don't look at clocks.  Yes, I do.  I look at the one that's over your head, usually.  Really?  And it's gone now.  And when I look, it was gone.  If you look at clocks, why don't you help me get to some of these breaks on time?  I do.  Oh, my God.  I do.  I see Fan, and he goes, break.  And there you go, Steve.  Just stand there holding the clock up all day.  That's how you executive produce. 
[00:02:00]  And if you see clocks, maybe you can help me realize when a bit's being run into the ground.  That stupid Australian yesterday.  I like holding clocks, but I hate the letter L.  I give grades for every show we do, and yesterday I had to give us a solid B.  Why?  And yesterday could have easily been an A-plus show.  Problem.  That Australian bitch that was on the phone for, what, 45 minutes? 
[00:02:30]  That was a while.  And that could have been one of those classic bits, and then there was no ending, and everyone  went home set.  That's, you know, that's what happens.  That's what happens.  I kind of enjoyed trying to, trying so hard.  Well.  It made me so angry.  Well, that's the secret of the Opie and Anthony show.  People don't realize.  Yeah.  We're willing to take some major chances live in front of your faces.  I mean, I've never, ever said that I was going to yank out somebody's hairs. 
[00:03:00]  From the inside.  From the inside.  That's very interesting.  I was going to take my hand and thrust my hand so that it would be behind a certain area  of hair on the human body.  And then scrape away the flesh until I found the roots of said hairs and pull them through  in, in.  And then yank hairs out that way. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Well.  I was that infuriated.  But we took the chance, and it was okay.  It was all right.  I mean, every single radio show out there, they don't take chances like that.  Everything has to be scripted.  Oh, no.  You know, they got to make sure they do their traffic and weather together on the eights.  I like how that works.  I love those slogans.  When I hear the traffic, I know the weather's coming up.  But then I'm on the wrong news channel.  Sometimes I get on the wrong news channel, and I go, okay, here's the traffic.  Now I can get the weather.  Oh, they do weather and then traffic. 
[00:04:00]  And they do it on the tens.  Now what?  Because their call letters have like 10-10.  10.  And then the 8-8-88 does it on the eights.  Well, I like traffic and weather together on the eights.  On the one?  Very confusing.  Oh, now I don't even remember.  No, it's the eights.  Traffic and weather together on the eights.  On the eights.  Very nice.  See?  And then they get huge ratings.  Yeah.  This is a radio station here in New York.  They get huge ratings for doing just traffic and weather.  Yep.  And a few headlines.  I tune in.  But they did the research back in the day, and the reason they get such high ratings is 
[00:04:30]  because they do traffic and weather every hour on the eights.  Yeah.  And that's it.  That's it.  That was it.  That's it.  So why don't we do that?  I would love to do that.  You know, a lot less stress for us instead of trying to come up with new crap every day  and try to be clever and funny and entertaining.  We feel miserably.  Phone number 877-212-080.  I want to say hi to everybody who loves dragons. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yes.  I'm a big fan of dragons, I decided.  After yesterday's show.  With that religious zealot.  We had a religious zealot, yes.  Ugh, what a tool.  And I couldn't accept the fact of science being what it is.  Right.  Try to turn it into a religion.  Right.  Saying that we were religious believing in science.  Right.  Because he was upset with the fact that he can't prove his beliefs in religion. 
[00:05:30]  Without starting this whole thing over again.  Basically, he said, what, the earth is no more than 6,000 years old.  He's one of those guys.  6,000 years.  How about that?  And so then we brought up dinosaurs, or Anthony did, and he said, well, those are dragons.  Those are dragons.  Because...  But wouldn't dragons be really old, too?  You would think.  So why did he say that dinosaurs were actually dragons?  Because when I think dragons, I think a real long time ago.  No, actually, I think like the 1400s with dragons. 
[00:06:00]  That's like, you know, castles and knights and dragons.  All right, but in the 1400s, the dragons didn't just appear.  They had to have their years of kind of developing into something.  Well, I don't know.  I think this guy just thinks...  What, all of a sudden, poof?  Dragons.  Like a Harry Potter thing happened, and then poof, dragons everywhere started in the 1400s?  Yes.  Ugh.  He is an ass.  Well, if you like dragons, I want to say hi to you today.  Let's say hi to Nick from Australia. 
[00:06:30]  Nick!  Opie, how you doing?  Nick, you're not allowed to hang out with us anymore when you come to the States.  It could have been the most embarrassing thing I've ever heard in my life.  Well, we're talking about Nick's mom, who decided to completely derail the Opie and Anthony  show for close to an hour yesterday, and actually, there was some good radio in there, but we  were hoping for the big finish, and we never got to the big finish, because your mom is  really stupid.  She is the most annoying person now in two hemispheres. 
[00:07:00]  She wouldn't shut up.  What is wrong with her?  For the people that didn't hear that part of the show yesterday, Nick's mom called to  wish Nick a happy birthday, because Nick comes to the States a couple times a year, and he  hangs with us.  He loves the show that much.  He listens online.  So his mom thought it'd be cool to call us up and make sure we wish Nick a happy birthday,  which is what, today?  No, no, no.  April 30th.  April 30th. 
[00:07:30]  We couldn't even get that info out of your mom, by the way.  Or maybe in the middle of all that babbling, she was able to say that.  And then we wanted her to play one of our favorite games, Guess What's In My Pants.  And then she wouldn't shut up for, the bit was basically Anthony yelling, shut up for  a half hour, which was entertaining to a point, and then I had to get involved because I was  frustrated.  I was so frustrated.  Then I'm thinking she's now, now she thinks that she should just keep interrupting because  that's now the bit. 
[00:08:00]  That's what I've had for 20 years.  Oh, really?  She just won't shut up?  She's the most annoying person.  Did you punch her in the face yesterday?  What's that?  Did you give her a good belt to the face?  I just wanted to kick her down the stairs.  She called and wanted you guys to wish me happy birthday like I have cancer.  I'm perfectly fine.  I don't need a happy birthday.  But she tried to call and, of course, derailed it. 
[00:08:30]  And my dad read Whack Bag and Radio Golf Fans this morning, and some of the quotes on there  were just classic.  Yeah, I think most of the O&A community hates your mom.  Yes.  That's not a good thing.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Well, happy birthday, Nick.  Yeah.  Thanks.  In two weeks or whatever it is.  So, when are you coming to the States again?  Hopefully for...  Are you guys doing car crash comedy? 
[00:09:00]  I'm hoping you'll do it again.  This summer, maybe for traveling virus.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  Yeah, man.  I'll put a trip on my credit card, and I'll head over and give that a shot.  I'm doing stand-up here, so...  Oh, right on.  We'll look at him.  Well, next time you're in the States, we'll just have you do a set for us.  All right.  Cool, man.  All right?  All right.  No worries.  All right.  Thanks, Nick.  All right.  Cheers, man.  We're going to keep this short, because, you know, your mom really, really wrecked it yesterday.  Slap your mom in the face.  27 minutes. 
[00:09:30]  27 minutes.  It was 27 minutes?  Nick.  We did a 27-minute phone call with your mom?  Obama wouldn't get 27 minutes.  This lady with a drinking problem from down under seems to just derail.  Yeah.  Does your mom kind of tip...  She tips a few back, or what?  Oh.  She drinks like Norton when he was 17.  Unfortunately, she hasn't cut her wrist yet.  Yeah, I could tell she was a little drunk. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, she liked it.  All right.  Then I have to agree with you, Ant.  I really thought she was playing us.  No, I didn't think she was playing.  I think she seriously just couldn't be quiet.  Because she just had a few in her?  Yeah.  All right.  Constantly.  No bit.  It's a bit horrid.  Well, thanks, Nick.  Good luck with the gigs, man.  All right.  Cheers, man.  All right.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Matt in Brooklyn.  Matt, what's up?  He's a funny dude, man.  Yeah, Nick is funny.  Matt.  What's up, boy?  Hey.  Yeah.  No, I just want to say it's a little observation, guys.  Like, you guys are using the science facts for your arguments, for your favor in the whole 
[00:10:30]  religion debate.  When it comes to 9-11, you guys are quick to dismiss it.  I mean, I'm not a 9-11 coup, but that was just a little observation.  Because science has proven that these conspiracies are crap.  I don't know about crap, but there's, like, some things that, like, the rate of gravity.  Oh, stop with the rate of gravity.  You know what, dude?  Like, to be honest with you, I don't know enough about the math formula for the rate  of gravity, but I've seen that argument debunked. 
[00:11:00]  I saw someone saying about the rate of gravity, and someone said, you don't understand whatever  the formula was, and he completely shut the guy down.  And I knew that the guy who was quoting the math theorem knew what he was talking about.  And why would it fall any faster or slower if it was a controlled detonation, or if it  was a collapsing building?  Yeah, wouldn't you need to...  Like, wouldn't it still have to fall at a certain rate?  Wouldn't you need the hand of God pushing it down really fast?  Yeah, to fall faster than gravity.  That's why I don't get with that argument.  What are you getting at with that?  Yes, then.  The thinking is that the explosions caused a vacuum underneath them, which then sucked 
[00:11:30]  the floors down faster than gravity.  Oh, shut up.  That makes no sense.  Why?  Because all the air was sucked out of the area?  Yeah, but...  I'm not a normal coo, but I'm just saying...  Oh, no, and the concussions of the explosions actually pad between the floors and keep them  up a little longer with the pressure from the explosions?  That's another way of looking at it, too.  Hey, Jesus.  Well, you know what, dude?  It's the way that the conspiracy theorists talk about it. 
[00:12:00]  They're like, the way it fell, it should have taken...  They act like it should have taken an hour and 20.  Yeah.  Like, you know, there's 110 buildings.  If each one falls with air under it for 45, we get it.  It was accurate.  Matt, I curse you today.  It's too early for the 9-11 conspiracy thing.  I know it is a little bit, but I'm just saying, like, it was just a little observation.  But, like, I'm not a physicist, nothing, but it's just like...  No?  Well, he wanted to make sure we weren't going to get confused with that.  I know. 
[00:12:30]  And Dr. Cock, who we're not even disagreeing with.  We just...  I think a plane could vaporize, like, you know, just sort of stuff like that.  Yes.  Yes, actually.  Yes, it can.  Dude, I didn't think so either until I saw a military footage of a military jet slamming  into a concrete wall that they had built to test to protect nuclear facilities.  Right.  And this plane crashed into it, and it disintegrated.  Every bit of it turned to dust.  It was gone.  The plane.  It vanished.  A lot of people, when they fly, they think they're in this plane that is just like, you 
[00:13:00]  know, the structure on this thing is just amazing.  Relatively speaking, it's tinfoil.  Yeah.  You're flying in tinfoil.  You could pretty much kick out a window or kick out the side of the plane.  Kick the panel out.  Yeah.  If you have enough kicks in you.  I thought yesterday's radio show was very good, guys.  I did, too.  It just came up to you.  It's like, I was thinking about the whole, when Jimmy took on Jesse Ventura last week,  and...  Yeah, we're just...  We're getting to be thought-provoking.  Yeah, we're thought-provoking and, yeah, confrontational as well. 
[00:13:30]  If we can't make you laugh, we'll be...  Oh, go ahead, man.  I'm sorry.  Just another question.  Did you guys see...  I know, like, that whole loose change thing was like...  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  No.  Help me.  God.  Help me.  Have we seen it?  Yes.  Help me.  God.  I've seen a bunch of them.  A bunch of them like that.  Do you ever see Zeitgeist?  That's really familiar.  What's that one?  That's another one of those.  I haven't seen that one yet.  Oh, stop.  All right.  Well, watch Zeitgeist, okay?  Loose Change is a documentary on Steve from Bayshore being paid for his...  Oh, just step on my crap! 
[00:14:00]  All right, Matt, we're done with you.  I'm sorry.  God damn it!  It's just too early for the 9-11 stuff.  I'll let you guys go.  All right, thank you.  Had Steve from Bayshore in it.  Had the fact that he doesn't get paid.  What was the loose change thing?  I'm not going to say it now.  You'll make fun of me.  You got stepped on.  I was annoyed for you.  All right, give it a try.  No, no, because now I'm annoyed.  Go ahead, just give it a try.  I'm annoyed from that idiot stepping on me.  I will acknowledge that you're...  Nope!  We'll acknowledge you're annoyed, but give it a try.  Nope!  Give it a try.  Nope!  Because it's about Steve and S. from Bayshore, who does the fine show rundown on onaradio.com. 
[00:14:30]  Let's go.  Thank you.  You got a loose change joke.  Let's hear it.  He's a Nazi.  Let's hear it.  He's a Nazi.  He's got loose change.  There are Nazi coins in his pocket.  Never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down.  Rick rolls.  Never gonna run.  Damn!  He's hurt you.  Never gonna make you cry.  All right.  Doing a little dance.  So what happened since the last radio show?  Well, we got a guy throwing out the first pitch at a Yankees game from space.  Who had time to wait for that ball to make it to home plate? 
[00:15:00]  Did it ever make it to home plate?  I had to give up after five hours.  Burnt up in the atmosphere.  Oh, it never made it through the atmosphere?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It burnt up.  I don't know where the hell he...  No.  I think they just...  They actually had some dirt from the pitcher's mound.  Uh-huh.  And I believe he stood on that as much as you can stand on it while you're floating around.  You can't stand on dirt in space?  And then just kind of tossed the ball.  It was probably in a bag.  I don't even know.  And what happened?  Because I hate the Yankees. 
[00:15:30]  I don't watch Yankee games.  So, do they have some hacky thing where all of a sudden the ball appeared and somebody caught it?  Or does the ball just float there awkwardly and then the announcers have to take it from there?  Yeah.  I think...  Like, how did it play out?  I didn't see it.  But I'm assuming that the guy in space threw the ball.  Right.  But inside the space station.  Sure.  So, it didn't leave the space station.  And then at the same time, somebody probably threw the pitch at Yankee Stadium. 
[00:16:00]  And it was kind of a, you know, at the same time thing.  Because there's no way the ball's getting from space to Yankee Stadium.  How long did it take before everybody there went, wow, this really sucks.  This is a dumb idea.  This is a dud.  That's a Costanza idea from when he worked for the Yankees.  A ball from space.  Really?  And then I watched the debate last night, Hillary and Obama, and I pretty much changed the channel 
[00:16:30]  and watched, like, Tyra Banks' clips.  Really?  Yeah.  That's how interested I was in what they were saying yesterday.  What's going on with her?  Well, Jimmy, like, I mean, Obama has a great opportunity.  This whole freaking country, like, not this whole country, but a lot of Democrats, really  just behind Obama.  A lot of people saying they've never seen a candidate have such a buzz like Obama has.  But the guy can't, like, throw the knockout punch and get things going.  I think that is showing his lack of experience. 
[00:17:00]  I totally agree with you.  The fact that he has this buzz is, I think, a lot has to do, and it's been brought up and  people have gotten in trouble for actually saying it.  The fact that he is the first real viable black candidate for president of the United States.  I think that's why there's so much buzz about him.  He's got charisma.  He speaks very well.  He does.  Great public speaker.  Yeah, he gets people motivated. 
[00:17:30]  I think the inexperience is just starting to show more and more with this guy.  He's very inexperienced.  Oh, what the hell does Kenny have?  Oh, Jesus.  And he's putting on his granny glasses.  Get your finger on the dump button.  I'm sure this will get us in trouble.  Good morning, people.  It's Club Soda Kenny with Traffic and Weather on the 8th.  Oh.  Oh, hi, Kenny.  Hi.  In the five boroughs of New York City so far on the 59th Street Bridge inbound,  there was an accident on the upper level, but nobody died. 
[00:18:00]  In Manhattan, the 39th Street between Lexington and Park is closed due to a manhole fire.  Hopefully, that'll turn into a big catastrophe.  The Hudson River crossings, inbound George Washington Bridge.  Delays are only five minutes now, but hopefully it'll stack up and be longer.  All right?  And it's going to be a beautiful day in New York City, but nobody cares about that.  Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, cloudy. 
[00:18:30]  Detroit, Memphis, Houston, cloudy.  Dallas, windy, possible thunderstorms.  Denver, snow showers.  How about Dunderhead?  I know.  In Kansas City, there's going to be thunderstorms.  This has been Club Soda Kenny with Traffic and Weather on the 8th.  Thank you.  All right, a couple observations.  First of all, where's the 8th in your pit?  There's not even an 8th.  It's like 620.  It's a 5th.  If you're going to do traffic and weather on the 8th, you've got to be here right on the 8th 
[00:19:00]  because people expected right on the 8th.  I was a little late.  I was riding.  My second observation.  I don't feel comfortable having a guy with a stuffy nose protect my interests.  I got allergies.  He's got a stuffy nose.  You sound like you're crying.  No, I got allergies.  He's got a stuffy nose.  How are you going to protect us with a stuffy nose?  I'm not going to blow my nose on people.  Blowing snot rockets at people. 
[00:19:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  Thank you.  So how many times do we have to sit through that?  On the 8th.  Every 8th?  No, we'll see.  I'll surprise you.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to be surprised all morning with Club Soda Kenny doing traffic and weather on  the 8th.  And in sporting news, the Dender Broncos.  Dender.  All right.  Let's say hi to Gio in New York.  Gio.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  How's it going this morning?  All right.  Hey.  Oh, how about those Yankees, huh? 
[00:20:00]  How about those Yankees?  How about those Rangers?  They were looking nice playing last night.  I know how much you love the Rangers.  Yeah, I don't really like the Rangers.  I think we're going to...  We're trying to get Sean Avery on the show, though.  And he wants to come on the show, but I think he has to wait for the end of this series.  Oh, why is everyone talking today?  Is there a problem with the phones?  Because if there is, it better be fixed immediately.  If there isn't, the callers are idiots.  Gio, you can hear me, right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  After the first round, we're going to, I think, get Sean Avery on our show.  But, yeah, they beat the Devils last night. 
[00:20:30]  And what, the Yankees beat the Red Sox?  Is that what's going on?  I think 15-9.  It was a biggie.  All right.  Thank you, Gio.  F the Rangers.  F the Rangers.  Ah, forget it.  You love the Rangers.  I really don't.  I don't really like the Devils much, either.  I think I've got to go Flyers for a little while.  I've got a little Philly connection, so maybe I'll give them a little love.  The Flyers a little love.  All right, Gio.  Thanks.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  We'll talk about Obama after the break.  Obama.  Kenny's a bit.  I ruined that discussion. 
[00:21:00]  Well, they have a bit.  That was.  I don't know.  Oh, heavens.  Hey, also, yeah, you know what?  I'm going to turn, for the people that are very hardcore fans of the Opie and Anthony show,  for the people that have an extremely sick sense of humor, I'm going to turn you on to  something called Remove Your Hat.  Okay?  I have to acknowledge there's all sorts of fans of this radio show. 
[00:21:30]  This one is for the sick ones, the ones that are just sick in the head and have an extreme  sick sense of humor, in my opinion.  Can I tell you something that made me laugh very hard in Remove Your Hat?  Yes.  It's, it was, you know, we're all laughing and I are rolling.  It was listening to Jim Jeffries, because Jim is laughing, but he had never seen it, and  to hear him getting it, and coming on board, and just roaring.  It's, uh, this thing, uh, taking on a life of its own. 
[00:22:00]  I believe it's going to be an internet, uh, sensation.  Steve, get your effing logo off our cartoon characters.  Who did that?  I want to get paid.  A listener made this one.  I don't want a Foundry music logo on my cartoon character.  I'm not a fan of labels.  Man.  Remove Your Hat on YouTube for the, uh, what?  I'm sorry, but how old is that shirt?  What? 
[00:22:30]  My Mr. Met?  Ancient.  My Mr. Met?  No, that's a new retro shirt.  I got a retro Mr. Met?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  T-shirt on.  See, it's all the rage to have shirts that look really old, but they're new.  You like it, Jimmy?  I like it.  He looked old, yeah.  Do you think, look at the seams and the collar.  It would be, like, that would be a mess if it was old.  It would be frayed.  Yeah.  I'm a slippery idiot.  All right, listen.  I want to turn people on to remove your hat.  Just put, remove your hat into YouTube.  If you're one of these fans of the show. 
[00:23:00]  Your hat!  That has a very sick sense of humor.  I got to acknowledge.  Because some people will be offended by this video.  Who could be offended?  A very scary that goes along with it.  Who could be offended by such comedy?  I would say, um, I would say 30% of the fans will get offended by this.  Oh, my God.  Believe it or not.  Way too high.  Way, what, 20%?  I'd say 0.2% would be offended.  That's people over 100 years old.  We got some fringe listeners here. 
[00:23:30]  With cotton candy hair.  Put, uh, remove your hat into YouTube.  Yes.  Uh, and I suggest a Google bomb today.  Let's make, let's make remove your hat number one on Google today.  Remove your hat.  You want to watch Taylor Hicks getting his hat punched off in an elevator with commentary.  Remove your hat.  Google bomb the hell out of it.  Make it the number one, uh, Google, uh, trend today.  Some surprise when that elevator door opens, huh?  All right. 
[00:24:00]  She just wants to go out and smell some lilacs.  Wham.  Instead, the bad guy in every John Singleton movie is standing there with his big fist balled up.  What was the line you had yesterday?  The, uh, hat, hat?  Oh, the hat removal ceremony is about to begin.  Oh, is that funny?  Remove your hat on YouTube and Google bomb the hell out of it.  We got to take our first break.  Opie and Anthony.  Go. 
[00:24:30]  Wake up, people.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Jim Norton.  He's going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah.  I'm hearing the tickets are pretty much sold out.  So if you're thinking of going to see Jim Norton, you better get on the phone and call Caroline's immediately.  212-757-4100.  You're in New York City, of course.  Thanks, man.  Phones are very, very nice today.  Let's say hi to Michelle in, uh, St. Louis, Missouri. 
[00:25:00]  Michelle, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was listening to the replay last night on XM.  Why did you not stop talking to that bitch like five minutes into the bit?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people are annoyed that we spent way too much time with that, uh, that Australian mom.  Well, we, because that's what we do with this show.  We, uh, we experiment and we try to make something happen, which is a very scary thing to attempt to do.  And sometimes you get radio gold and other times you fall flat on your face. 
[00:25:30]  Yesterday was, uh, somewhere in between.  I got to be honest.  I was trying my darndest.  Yeah.  To get her to shut up.  I felt so bad for you.  It's like, I thought maybe 10 minutes, like maybe she would finally shut the fuck up.  But it just wasn't happening.  She was sucking my will to live.  I was pondering my risk.  Yeah, you weren't happy with that one yesterday, huh?  That's a big fat negative.  All right.  Well, why don't you pop, uh, remove your hat into, uh, YouTube.  Yes, remove your hat. 
[00:26:00]  And, uh, enjoy the laughter.  Thanks.  All right, Michelle.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, I, I don't know.  I, I, I got obsessed with her.  Like I, I, it was a mission.  Yeah, well.  I just wanted her to shut up.  It also becomes the thing.  You really want to make, uh, something difficult work.  All right.  Hey, um, so we were talking about Obama before the break and, uh, he's getting another endorsement. 
[00:26:30]  Another fine endorsement out there.  Yeah.  This is a biggie too.  Is it?  Who do you think is endorsing Obama this morning?  Hmm.  You know the answer, Anthony.  Jimmy.  What kind of job do they have?  Yeah, I do.  I was faking it.  Uh, another big entertainer.  Another big entertainer is endorsing Obama.  Do I have a photo with him?  Um, hmm.  Oh.  Yes.  Wow.  But that could be thousands of people now. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  Is it, uh.  You get three questions.  Okay.  It's an entertainer.  I have a photo with him.  Does his name rhyme with thing cream?  As I was asking, I realized I read it.  You're such an idiot.  You're such an idiot.  Bruce Springsteen supporting Barack Obama in the race for the White House.  The boss says, uh, Barack speaks to the America that he has envisioned in his music for the past 35 years. 
[00:27:30]  Springsteen officially announced that he'll endorse Obama on his website.  He believes the Illinois senator is best, the best candidate, to undo what he calls the terrible damage done over the past eight years.  That's got to be good for at least, uh, 200 votes, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  At least.  At least.  Perhaps more than that.  You think people, uh, you think people really put any credence in that and go like,  Oh, if he endorses him, then I've got to vote for him.  If he wasn't going to vote for him in the first place, let's say somebody just had no clue. 
[00:28:00]  And then Bruce goes, yeah, I endorse Obama.  Do you think people actually go, all right, I'm going to do what Bruce does?  Well, I'm sure there's a lot of Republicans that like, uh, Bruce Springsteen and his music.  So all out of nowhere, they're going to like, uh, vote for Obama because they're a Bruce Springsteen fan.  I doubt it.  I absolutely doubt it.  You'll get a few votes here and there.  He's just from Bruce.  Back in the day, wasn't it just like a couple, like these candidates would get, uh, a few  really big endorsements and that was it.  Now everybody has to come out on their website and go, well, I'm endorsing McCain. 
[00:28:30]  I'm endorsing Hillary.  I'm endorsing Ron Paul.  Yeah.  I'm endorsing Obama.  What does it mean in the end?  Who cares?  It means nothing.  It's somebody's half-assed idea of, of, uh, who they think could make a good president.  And they're not qualified more than anyone else is.  Like Bruce isn't, Bruce doesn't have any more knowledge about, uh, these guys than anyone  else does.  So who cares?  Well, what's weird is he said it's an America that he's been singing about for 35 years. 
[00:29:00]  He's like, Obama represents the type of America that, uh, he has been singing about that his  songs have been about for 30 years.  You bring him in.  We have a huge, we have a huge Springsteen fan among us.  Oh, do we?  Let's see if this has an effect.  Uh, Roland is a massive, uh, Bruce Springsteen fan.  And now that, uh, Springsteen is, uh, endorsing Obama, will he be voting for Obama?  You know, endorsing is just, it almost seems like when someone endorsed it, it's like encouraging 
[00:29:30]  people just not to do their own homework.  Obama!  Oh, wow.  Now who are you?  Now you're voting for Obama because of Bruce?  Roland, who, uh, books the fine guests for this, uh, radio show.  Now, Roland, uh, who were you going to vote for before Bruce came out and, and endorsed  Obama?  I was debating between if McCain, I wasn't too sure.  But now I know.  Now you know you're, you're-  Obama.  Are you being serious?  I'm serious.  I'm going to vote for Obama.  So it was between McCain and, uh, well, it was between McCain. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I was trying to debate that.  I was like, I wasn't too sure, but.  Um, excuse me, Roland, but it's Club Soda Kenny, and it's time for the Opie and Anthony  traffic and weather on the 8th.  But it's 20 minutes later.  It's, but it's, it's 620.  It's not even close to an 8th.  You're two minutes off from the 8th day.  I'm doing the best I can, people.  All right.  Uh, and, and in the five boroughs in New York City, there's heavy traffic on the  Gowanus BQE, northbound between Prospect Parkway and Hamilton Avenue. 
[00:30:30]  Go figure.  Uh, upper east side river crossings on the Triborough Bridge to Queens.  There's an accident and the left lane is blocked.  Ha ha.  And in Jersey, there's an accident on, uh, east, um, um, eastbound 280 before the  Stickle Bridge.  So far, there's no casualties, but keep your fingers crossed.  But the Boston traffic people pay attention. 
[00:31:00]  Route 93, heavy traffic.  Route 1, delays, mass pike, a disabled tractor trailer.  And with the weather, in Seattle, it's raining.  And, and St. Louis, thunder showers.  And unfortunately, the air quality index is good today.  Thank you.  I'll be back at the eights.  Traffic and weather by an ape.  Ha ha ha.  I don't like the stuff he knows, man.  It's awful.  It just bothers me. 
[00:31:30]  Steve from, uh, Bayshore is saying, uh, traffic on the zeros is perfect for Kenny.  Ha ha ha.  Roland?  Oh, right.  We were talking to Roland about Bruce and his endorsement.  And a lot of people on Instant Feedback say they don't remember one Bruce Springsteen  song that, uh, that was about blacks, uh, Roland.  Yeah.  Oh, well, probably like, well.  That's right, Wendy!  I'm voting for a d***er, Wendy!  Well, Bruce is a-  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Bruce Springsteen's song's for the people, so it doesn't matter.  For the blue-collar worker? 
[00:32:00]  Everyone.  Yeah, but Republicans are people, too.  Yeah.  The rich are people, too.  He does sing for those people.  Huh?  He sings for everybody.  The guy that's, uh, driving to work with a suit on, he's a- he's a person as well.  Yeah.  So what do you mean by the people?  Well, everybody he sings for, so, like-  No, but he doesn't sing for everybody.  Well, if you go to his concert, it's like 150 a ticket, so-  He sings for the lower middle class, for the most part.  His songs are about the lower middle class.  Yeah.  Just trying to make ends meet.  Disenfranchised.  Disenfranchised. 
[00:32:30]  As he- as he drives, uh, to his gated mansions.  Uh-huh.  It was so weird just being on an elevator with him, just, like, a couple guys.  The kid, really, like, an intro.  Oh, wow.  Just having a little chat.  Took the whole ride up with him on the elevator, and then he got off, and me and Candy hadn't  hit a floor.  And he was like, all right, guys, this is my floor.  All the way up to his huge penthouse, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Where he writes songs about the common man.  About the guy going to the factory and working two jobs and-  Independence Day.  Huh?  The song Independence Day.  Is about what?  The factory's closing, and the guy has to go home and tell his wife he lost his job. 
[00:33:00]  Oh.  Oh.  I'm sure Bruce can relate to that.  Yes.  Well, how about Bruce, like, sells one of his many, many houses and helps a few families  out?  Yeah.  Why?  If he cares that much about the common man.  Yeah.  It's Bruce.  Don't buy into that crap.  He's a multimillionaire that found a niche.  He thinks Obama's Clarence.  That's all it is.  Vote for my bandmate.  Not one song about the black man.  I think Bruce Springsteen's racist. 
[00:33:30]  What do you think of that, Roland?  I don't think he's racist.  I think he's a bit racist.  He hasn't acknowledged the black man in any of his songs.  Or the songs would sound a bit different.  A f***er is coming to town.  A f***er is coming to town.  There's a f***er coming.  Whoa!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's see if it slid through.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:34:00]  Not a one, Roland.  Oh, let's say hi to Sean in Rockland.  Sean.  Hey, um, Bruce Springsteen in the song, My Hometown, sings about, uh, there's a lot  of fights between the black and white.  Something about, like, black people shooting white people with a shotgun.  Is that true, Roland?  There is a song there.  He's talking about the race riots.  I gotta stick up for dumb Bruce.  He's not, he's just saying that there was a lot of fights between the white people.  Same management company there, Rich?  No. 
[00:34:30]  We tore together, though.  Oh.  All right, Roland, so now you're gonna vote for Bruce because of the endorsement.  Yeah, it's because that means he'll go on tour to support Obama, so there'll be more  shows.  Even if we're just dancing with the dark.  Why'd you beat?  I bleeped the, uh, last part of it.  We're dancing in the dark.  Yeah.  You had it fine.  No, there's a couple other letters that could go on there.  I don't, I don't, I'm not a Bruce fan. 
[00:35:00]  I don't do the impression, but I like the song he sings about golf.  My cat, he's black.  My cat, he's black.  Hey, pretty good.  You know what?  Uh, Kevin in Virginia Beach.  What's up?  Guys, I got it for you.  Bruce Springsteen did do Jungle Land.  Hey, so thanks, Roland, and thanks, uh, Kenny for doing Traffic and Weather on the 8th. 
[00:35:30]  Hey!  Let's say hi to Bill in Jersey.  Bill, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  First time caller, long time listener, of course.  Thank you, sir.  Listen, I just wanted to make sure he's mentioned that Bruce does spend a lot of his time and  his own money making sure homeless people get fed, and, uh, you know, there are African  Americans in the homeless community, and, uh, he does that in his own pocket, too, so  let's not forget the good.  I would imagine he does some charitable things, uh, Bill.  We're a comedy-based show just trying to make a few jokes. 
[00:36:00]  We're just being dicks.  We're just being dicks.  I mean, if you're going to be a fan of this radio show, you've got to realize right off  the bat that we're just a bunch of dicks.  Bill, how much money do you make?  A little bill.  Uh, a little, uh, a little over six figures.  Where's the decimal point?  The point at the top of my head.  Oh, stop at the fresh talk.  That was a little joke, son.  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  So it's a little head.  Oh, my God.  Everyone is changing the Bruce songs now.  Because blanks like us, baby, we were born to run.  Oh, gee.  That's not nice.  Uh, let's say hi to Steve in Rhode Island.  Steve.  Black in the USA.  I, no one's really, um, being very creative.  Yeah, you're, it's a bit of a stretch.  Yeah, I know 41 Shots was, uh, uh, uh. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, yeah, but that was a fine song.  That's not classic, Bruce.  Anyone watching the, uh, the Pope?  Everyone is so fixated with the Pope.  I have Pope fever.  Yeah.  Could care less.  Well, the paper gives us little Pope facts every day.  Pope facts.  We enjoyed the Pope facts today.  The papal visit.  We learned that he has, uh, two pets.  Does he?  Where's my Pope facts?  I thought his hair was real. 
[00:37:30]  That means he just curses for no reason.  No, that was good.  No, it wasn't.  It should have went there.  All right, here's today's.  Are you guys ready for the, uh.  Pope Palpatine.  The five things he didn't know about the Holy Father.  His holiness.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he has two cats.  Something?  Chico and Joseph.  Mm-hmm.  One is a stray he found on the streets of Rome.  What kind of a made-up story is that? 
[00:38:00]  Who's gonna believe that the Pope's just wandering around?  Walking around.  And found a stray cat.  Here, kitty, kitty.  Here, kitty.  Oh, I will turn his eyes blue.  Couch them out.  All right.  Maybe he was getting, maybe he was getting, maybe he got it before he was Pope.  Maybe he might have had the cats from the old days when he was just a whatever.  Yeah, all do these cats.  And then he has a dog, uh, named Igor.  Igor.  That makes sense.  He does look kind of ghoulish. 
[00:38:30]  And none of the pets live with him at the Vatican because pets are not allowed there.  But you think.  It's his house.  Yeah, if you, if, if you're the Pope, you would think they would allow you to have pets.  Not even allow you.  You're the Pope.  You can say.  It is your house.  I'm infallible.  You, he makes the world.  Allowing pets here.  And now there's pets allowed in the Vatican.  He's the biggest dignitary in the world.  Just chewing up furniture that's hundreds of years old.  Why, uh, why, why the Pope?  Crap it on the floor.  Tangling on a Da Vinci. 
[00:39:00]  Igor.  Why the Pope mobile?  Uh, because people tend to take pot shots at the Pope.  Yeah, because John Paul had a little incident in 81.  They just love five shots.  He's still alive.  But he shouldn't be scared to die.  He's the Pope.  It's true.  So he, so he's basically telling everyone that he's scared to die too.  Uh, he probably isn't.  I think it's just a pain in the ass picking another Pope.  They just don't want to go through all that?  All that, uh.  Yeah, the smoke and the. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Man, try to find another Pope.  Uh, the Pope's favorite meal, everybody, is, uh, Bavarian potato ravioli with pancake strips.  Ooh.  Fun guy.  Ugh, I wouldn't want to go into the bathroom after him.  I thought it was Lil Billy.  Listen to this.  Just imagine what kind of mixture this would, uh, would, would get going in your system.  So he likes that, then he likes mozzarella, orange Fanta soda, and Bavarian Christmas cookies. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  That's why he needs such a big hat.  I think if he's out on the road, he's in the Popemobile, he can just flip that thing over.  Let's go to Bob at Jersey.  Bob?  Yeah, aren't his pets, uh, two altar boys?  What?  He bailed out.  The line was pretty good.  It says, how many altar boys does he keep?  As pets.  As pets.  They don't live in the Vatican.  Uh, another, uh, Pope fact.  He is the youngest of three children, everyone. 
[00:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  His father was a police officer.  I bet.  That's what they called him.  His sister worked as a housekeeper.  Police officer.  His brother, it's called a brown shirt.  And his brother is a retarded priest.  What?  I mean, retired priest.  Oh.  Number four, he has a pilot's license, but not a driver's license.  A Pontius?  That's a bad joke. 
[00:41:00]  Pray for me.  You can't have a Pontius pilot license.  He doesn't die.  I know, but pilot, I don't know.  License to do what?  Dustin's snap is there.  The snap, the ball is down.  The kick is on its way.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  No, no, no, no.  Waiter, he said no good.  No good.  Oh, it was no good?  Difficult to give you.  Just rickroll that joke.  Uh, so he has a pilot's license, but he doesn't have a driver's license.  He likes to fly the papal. 
[00:41:30]  Try again.  There's a papal helicopter?  Yeah.  Really?  You gotta see the thing.  It's great.  Does it have a logo on the side and all that?  Yeah.  I like to think Batman logos on all the Pope stuff.  Cool, futuristic lettering.  Yeah.  Do you think they get annoyed when he wants to take the helicopter for a ride?  They're like, look, he wants to take it for a ride.  And they gotta let him, because he's the Pope.  He's on the roof of the Vatican.  He just goes up and down.  He goes up like 10 feet and down again.  They all have to go, ooh.  And he goes vroom, vroom a lot.  His robes.  He takes the helicopter out to his summer home in Italy. 
[00:42:00]  And then, finally, he plays the piano, his favorite piece of music.  He has a few.  He's a Vali fan.  Mozart's clarinet quintet.  Does he blast it from his copter as he goes and machine guns Asians?  That's right!  Put that pontoon right up.  Oh, no.  And finally, the fifth.  Hello.  What?  Hi.  It's Club Sona Kenny with the Opie and Anthony traffic and weather on the 8th.  Club Sona Kenny. 
[00:42:30]  Being punctual, as always.  In Westchester, there's an accident.  Kenny.  What?  If you're going to do traffic and weather on the 8th, you've got to get in here on the 8th.  It's now 6.53.  It's 8 minutes to 7.  Yeah, see?  Anthony, you had a negative.  Anthony turned it into a positive.  Yeah.  But if we're going to get this thing going where people are going to get used to this,  where they're going to tune in every day on the 8th to hear you, you've got to be in  here on the 8th.  It's like Scorch's color and number of the day. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  He probably did it exactly the same time so people knew what color to wear.  All right, bud.  All right.  Do your traffic.  All right.  Just, yeah.  In Westchester, there's an accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway northbound at the  Penhandle Avenue multiple injuries.  On Long Island, there's an accident on the Northern State Parkway by exit 42.  Only the right lane is open.  The Hudson River Crossings inbound linking tunnels delays up to 20 minutes, but you know 
[00:43:30]  that won't last long, so you better call in late to work.  In New Jersey, Warren County, a car hit a deer by Bass Castle Road.  Route 22 westbound north Plainfield where Voss is from.  There's an accident, but I don't think it's his fault.  And there's rubbernecking delays.  Ugh.  I got Buffalo traffic and weather.  Buffalo, there's an accident with possible injuries involving a motorcycle at the Cayuga  Creek in William in Chikawaga. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  We also have an accident block in the center lane on the 90 just east past William.  I don't know who he is.  Motorists may encounter lengthy delays at times at the International Bridge, so check your current  bridge conditions by calling 1-800-715-6722 and then press 2.  Who's going to do that?  I don't know.  Who's going to do that?  There's construction delays by 2 Rod Road. 
[00:44:30]  It's closed from Broadway to Westwood in Alden until 5 p.m.  Huron is closed from Delaware to Elmwood.  And there's lane restrictions on the Route 20 Southwest Boulevard between South Park Avenue  and Hamburg and Miles Strip Road.  What happened to your little jokes?  Yeah, the whole bit works if you, like, do the commentary.  Yeah, a little commentary about how you like the disasters and wish for death.  You're doing real traffic.  Yeah, now you're just giving traffic. 
[00:45:00]  You went from a really good bit to a bore fest within 20 minutes.  What are you doing?  All right, here.  We have to tear down the wall for people.  The reason this works is because you're all about doom and gloom.  You're doom and gloom.  So when you say there's rubbernecking delays, you know, then you have a little cute little  joke in there.  All right, here's a good joke here.  All right.  Buffalo weather.  It'll be 65 degrees today.  That's good.  But be careful of the wind chill, the humidity, and the dew point. 
[00:45:30]  Did you like that one?  Speaking of dew points, this is crap.  And there's a full moon coming on April 20th.  Thank you.  This has been Club Soda Kenny with the Opie and Anthony traffic weather on the 8th.  Thank you.  How appropriate an ass and a full moon reference.  Kenny, a lot of pressure now.  You came up with a great bit.  Now it's an awful bit.  If you come in here again and it's awful, then the bit's over.  Bit's over.  It's got to.  This is going to have the shortest shelf life in Opie and Anthony history. 
[00:46:00]  Well, you know what?  Why don't we just end it for now?  Because I like to leave people wanting more.  I'm too late.  No, we need one more.  One more to bring it around.  Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I finally figured out who Club Soda Kenny sounds like.  Okay.  An ass.  Remember the old Bugs Bunny cartoons when Bugs Bunny would get kidnapped by the two criminal guys?  What?  The big stupid guy would go, okay, Mugsy. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  The big dopey crook and then the little guy.  Can we get audio of that?  Can we try to find audio of that and see if Max is onto some?  All right.  Thank you, Max.  Let's see how to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Yeah.  How you doing?  I just want to report a train wreck in the studio.  That's not good.  Jim Norton.  Phone number 877-212-ONA. 
[00:47:00]  Moving right along here.  I got a mic that keeps falling.  Watch.  Oops.  Broadcat.  Oh.  Oh, we got a little Viagra.  Oh, this keeps falling.  Maybe the arm of the microphone shouldn't be eight feet long.  Look at this thing.  It's got like one, two, three, four, five, six joints on it.  And if they're not all tightened, this is what you get. 
[00:47:30]  We're back with the...  Oh, it fell down again.  That spring needs to be tightened.  And then I got to hold the damn thing the entire time.  Hey, Tim's working on something down the hall to enhance the club soda Kenny bit.  Oh.  And he heard something very hack.  It's traffic.  No, no, he's not going to do that, thank God.  Not today.  We're trying to rest things.  Yeah, are we?  So they have a bit of a shelf life.  No, but he was listening to the news station here in town. 
[00:48:00]  And he heard something that was extremely hack.  So he decided to bring it to our attention.  Here it is.  Pope on U.S. soil.  Makes sense.  The Mets get a home run from Ryan Church.  Bam.  First inning.  Hits one out.  Oh.  Oh, no.  No.  He didn't say that.  Yeah, he did.  Ryan Church.  Ryan Church hit a home run.  And the Pope's in...  The Pope's in town.  Wow, what a non-coincidence.  But the Pope's not even in town. 
[00:48:30]  No.  No.  He's in the U.S.  That would only be interesting if the guy's name was like Ryan Pedophilia Cover-Up.  Or something.  Oh, but very good news for Catholics yesterday, Jimmy.  The Pope acknowledged the sex abuse scandal.  Let's go.  And he acknowledged that it was badly handled.  Yeah?  Yes.  What a guy.  So there you go.  All is forgiven.  So what's going to happen? 
[00:49:00]  Is that going to change the way priests act around young boys?  Certain priests act around young boys?  I'm sure they're taking a closer look at what's going on ever since this scandal really hit critical mass.  Do you honestly think they look at what the Pope said and then go like, oh, oh, we weren't supposed to do that?  Right.  Oh, damn.  I thought the Pope was all into that.  Why?  If God didn't want us to, he wouldn't make it so snug. 
[00:49:30]  Snug.  Oh, you're tightening the screws, Tim?  I need a screwdriver.  He needs a screwdriver.  Oh, no.  He's doing it while they're live on the air.  You think this will affect the broadcast?  I don't know.  What do you think?  He's backing up the nut with pliers.  That's not good. 
[00:50:00]  You're going to strip it.  Why are you doing it that way, Tim?  There it goes.  See, this stinks.  Just look.  Yeah, perfect.  All right, look.  Perfect as it just flops back down.  Just stand there like that the whole show, Tim, with it on your shoulder.  No problem.  I didn't need that eye.  Thanks, Tim.  Your juicy dumper right by open.  Oh, see, we probably shouldn't be doing this live on the air. 
[00:50:30]  We're broadcasting to a hell of a lot of people right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  That might have done it.  I don't know what, but.  Hey, thank you, Tim.  It'll be good for 10 minutes, maybe.  Yeah, exactly.  The Pope in D.C.  We got a man on the street interview from kids.  Aw.  This is really, really quick.  What's fun about this clip?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, this is radio, because when we saw it on TV a mere hour ago on this station  here in New York called The CW, which is basically like beginner news or something. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  They cough through their broadcast.  They're just a mess, these people.  They can't get their graphics right.  They can't get their teleprompters right, I guess.  It's just a disaster.  What were some of the problems they were having today?  And this is Channel 11 here in New York.  It's a pretty big news station.  I know recently they cut to somebody and the intern was still standing next to the weather  person and had to run out of frame real quick.  Speaking of weather. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, no.  It's Club Soda Kenny.  You just pushed that out of the way.  Well, it's time.  It's Club Soda Kenny with the O.P. and Anthony Traffic and Weather on the 8s.  Kenny.  Yeah.  7-10.  Well, somebody was talking.  Traffic and Weather on the 8s with Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you for that uplifting intro.  In Westchester, South Fulton Avenue is closed between Sanford Boulevard and A Street for ongoing 
[00:52:00]  cleanup of a fire at a chemical supply building.  Closures will be in effect till tomorrow because, you know, when chemicals catch fire, sometimes  they release poisonous clouds that could take out the entire town.  In New York City, that 39th Street manhole fire between Lexington Park Avenue, no bodies  have been recovered yet, but the day's early. 
[00:52:30]  The day's early.  Yeah.  New Jersey, Turnpike Southbound before Interchange 11, right lanes closed in the truck lanes due  to a truck fire.  And if it's a gasoline truck, that could kill a lot of people.  Thank you, let me know.  Now, let's do Cleveland traffic because Cedar Avenue eastbound at East 55th Street is closed  due to a broken water main.  This will probably cause a drought. 
[00:53:00]  Heavy traffic on I-77 northbound between East Railton Road and Wallings Road.  That's what happens in rush hour.  Road construction at Route 6 between Bishop Road and Warrow Road.  Traffic will be maintained utilizing flaggers.  Insert your own joke here.  Highway 21 northbound at I-77 is closed due to road construction until July. 
[00:53:30]  Try walking.  And Stearns Road between Lorraine Road and I-480.  East half of Stearns Road between Lorraine Road.  I just said that.  It's closed due to bad weather.  Good for you.  So, that's been Club Soda Kenny with Traffic and Weather, Opie and Anthony on the 8s.  Thank you.  All right.  Here's the problem with this segment.  All right.  What happened to the weather part of the Traffic and Weather bit?  I don't know.  This is a lot of work every on the 8s. 
[00:54:00]  Now, the news station does it every on the 8s all the time.  And they've been doing it for years.  Can we get an example of how it's supposed to be done for the next time?  But listen, you look out the window if you want to know the weather.  They're doing this every 10 minutes.  They're smooth.  Here's your traffic.  Here's your weather.  Bop, bop, bop.  And back to news headlines.  You started off saying that sometimes there's a chemical fire.  It releases poisonous glass. 
[00:54:30]  I know.  I do the best I can.  I know.  But you changed it to a hard substance.  It could happen.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Hold on.  I got something for you, Kenny.  All right.  Well, looks like we've given the slip, Muggsy.  Yeah, Rocky.  We sure did.  I wish I was smart like you, boss.  Yeah.  Oh, Max, right on, man.  You just developed a bit for us.  Hey, Muggsy, we better get some shut-eye if and we're going to pull that job tomorrow. 
[00:55:00]  Okay, boss.  That'll teach us to get ideas.  But, boss, you know I don't get any ideas.  Well, see that you don't.  But, G.H.  A million laughs.  Pretty close.  Jimmy, give me a light. 
[00:55:30]  Okay, boss.  Yeah, boss.  Yeah, yeah.  Gee, I'm glad you're not mad at me no more.  Aw, now you're mad at me again.  All right, boss.  I got to go fetch your food now.  Fetch.  But, Kenny, you got to be back here in three minutes because the eights are coming up again already.  No, I got to fetch your food now, boss.  But if your bits can be traffic and weather on the eights, you got to, like, just do that. 
[00:56:00]  No, no, no.  I'll fit it in somehow, some way.  But it should be every eight.  That's what the real news station does.  All right.  I'll be back in a couple of eights.  All right.  A little taste of club soda, Kenny.  If the doctor tells you you have eights.  I'm sorry to Kenny singing.  That I dug my key into the side.  With his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive.  Carved my name into his leather seats. 
[00:56:30]  I took a Louisville slugger to both end lights.  Slashed a hole in all four tires.  Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  I don't know why I always sing girl songs.  He's a treat for everyone.  So, the Pope in D.C., they did a little man-on-the-street interview from the kids.  And this news station here in New York, we watch it every morning. 
[00:57:00]  We just laugh at them.  Train wreck.  Because they really mess up a lot in the morning.  And the caption, as they're trying to do the story, read, church abuse victims.  Yeah.  As this little girl is talking about how she loves seeing the Pope, they showed the graphic  on the bottom.  It said, church abuse victim.  Yeah.  Underneath her.  And you know she was all excited.  The family's probably all gathered around the TV.  They're taping.  Waiting.  This is her moment. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, this is her moment.  And they see her face and go, oh, here you are, here you are.  And then they look, and it says, church abuse victim underneath her picture.  It was for the next story.  Yeah.  Where they were talking with the church abuse victim.  Of course.  They screwed it up.  I think the main message of Benedict XVI is the phrase he used before he left Rome to  come to the United States.  And that is a message of Christian hope.  Many of his American flock are getting to see the Pope up close. 
[00:58:00]  This crowd along Pennsylvania Avenue, in some spots 20 feet deep, with onlookers straining  to get a snapshot with their cell phones or just a fleeting glance.  It was kind of heavenly.  It looked like he was on a white cloud and just carried him by.  It was like seeing Jesus on Earth.  Exactly.  Good.  You know what?  That's exactly the image they try to portray with the Pope.  I'm glad you dummies.  I mean, they're kids.  All right.  Fair enough.  But is that what it was like seeing Jesus?  No, it's a guy in red shoes who rose to the top of the corporation. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  He's not your holiness.  And he's not a heavenly father.  He's just a guy.  And he's in his Popemobile.  And they assumed it looked like a cloud he was on.  What the hell is wrong with these kids?  I don't know.  Idiots.  I'm not feeling this Pope.  You're stupid.  John Paul the, what, second?  Yes.  I felt that guy.  Yeah?  He had a little charisma to him.  This guy, I'm not feeling him.  I just don't like the way they elevate the Pope to a holy place. 
[00:59:00]  It's irritating.  He puts on his shoes just like you and I.  That's the job.  He hits the bathroom every morning just like you and I.  But he's got that, you know, the hotline to God or something.  But he doesn't.  How does he have...  If he didn't, he'd be 500.  The Pope would be 500 years old if he had that much juice.  He looks it.  Well, all right.  This guy's wearing red shoes.  They say he's got flair and pizzazz.  That's...  Oh.  Well, Kenny wrecked what we really wanted to do here. 
[00:59:30]  So we're going to have to wait for after the break for...  Yeah.  ...possibly an angry Vince bit today.  But we do have a cute little story.  Yesterday, what, we had that lady doing the YouTube video?  Mm-hmm.  Trying to get back at her older husband?  Yeah.  Because the divorce wasn't going so well for her?  She was bitter.  And she was looking for sympathy out there and everyone's like thinking,  what a C.  What a C.  Yeah.  There's a prenup and I guess it's pretty ironclad.  And it gives her a lot, by the way. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  She's not walking away with nothing.  No, but she wants more.  And she was trying to get something going with this YouTube video.  The media was all over yesterday and people were like,  eh, whatever.  You're just a C.  Today, we've got a guy.  Mm-hmm.  He makes flyers announcing that his ex has herpes.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Hans Adams is the picture of control.  He rarely moves and doesn't react, even when the comments are damaging. 
[01:00:30]  When she talks about Adams, Susan Gordon can hardly contain her hatred.  It's not the flyer.  The flyer she's talking about shows her best friend having sex under the words disease carrier.  Hans Adams contracted genital herpes from the woman whose face is on the flyer and whose identity we're protecting.  Adams is on trial for mass distributing the flyers, facing considerable prison time if he's convicted of the obscure charge,  maliciously disseminating information of a sexually transmitted disease. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  What?  That's a crime?  That's a crime?  What?  But if she has it, where's the crime?  It's like the scarlet letter.  You can't put up pictures of people with diseases.  I don't know.  Pop them up on telephone poles.  Leprosy.  I do that with every extra friend.  Scarvy.  She's got rickets, this one.  Scrimshaw whore.  The shingles.  Wow.  Even though Adams knew about the herpes, it wasn't a problem until the relationship ended. 
[01:01:30]  Then police say he extracted his revenge, faxing the flyers to the woman's workplace along with a graphic video.  The final straw came when police say Adams plastered the suggestive flyers all over Plantation Middle, where the woman's son went to school.  A child coming to me, one of the kids coming to me, and saying, do you see what I have here?  It certainly did get emotional at times.  Now, we have not heard from Adams, who's going to try to turn the tables on his accuser, accusing her of being that jealous, possessive one. 
[01:02:00]  God, that's a good one.  What was the worst thing you ever did to an ex, Jimmy?  Did you do anything crazy?  To be honest, I don't think I've ever been malicious to an ex.  Other than vicious things we said to each other, I've never tried to hurt an ex.  I've never tried to malign them.  It's really weird.  As awful as I can be in a relationship, I've just never had that type of vindictiveness towards an ex. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  No, never.  My story, and I know I have a cassette somewhere, and I've told it a bunch.  When I was living in Buffalo, I was going out with this girl, and the whole time, the boyfriend was in the picture, but she swore nothing was going on, blah, blah, blah.  And then we break up.  She didn't want anything to do with me, but then I started seeing someone else, and for some reason, that set off jealous rage in her.  I'm like, wait a minute, but you don't want anything to do with me.  I'm not going to sit here like I'm, you know, like she didn't want me.  Yeah.  And I was suspicious of the ex, so we broke up, and I start seeing a girl, you know, in Buffalo, when you're living up there, becomes a very small town. 
[01:03:00]  It really does.  She finds out, and then she left on my answer machine.  I've told this a bunch of times.  She left audio on my answer machine of her having sex with this guy that I was suspicious of the whole time, this coke head, who I heard may have passed to the other side since I left Buffalo.  Rumor has it.  Not that I keep track. 
[01:03:30]  So what was that like?  You hit your answering machine, you're just going through messages.  You hit that, and were they right in the middle of it already?  It was pretty brutal, because I'm not going to lie to you.  I still had a little thing for this girl at the time, even though she didn't want anything to do with me, but I'm like, all right, you really got to move on, and I did.  But, you know, part of my heart was still, like, you know, beating for her, and I think she knew that, and for some reason, she wanted to really just dig in, and she described everything that was going on. 
[01:04:00]  Everything.  At any point on the message, was she talking like this?  No, but then she gave the phone to the guy so he could talk and say what he was doing.  Oh, wow.  It was brutal.  Where did your hand go?  I don't know where mine would have been.  I would have been hurt, and through the tears, I would have found myself just moving my hand.  Cuckled.  I broke a few things. 
[01:04:30]  I was so pissed off, so pissed.  And if I, it was well over a dozen messages, one after another.  Just, it was an all-night thing, and they just kept calling my answer machine, and just, it got worse and worse, and it was full action, full audio, full completions going on.  Really?  It was brutal.  So you heard her, like, moaning and stuff like that?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Him doing his thing, and it was unbelievable. 
[01:05:00]  So I told a story.  I was working at the Fox back in the day in Buffalo, and I aired a lot of the tapes on the air during my overnight show, so maybe about 24 people heard it.  And then when I knew her mom was at work, I called her mom's answer machine and just let her know what her daughter was up to.  Oh, and played the tape, yeah.  And then did the same thing to her 80-some-odd-year-old grandfather.  Sure, he loved hearing that.  That she loved like a father because she didn't have a father.  Another one of these girls that had father issues, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:05:30]  And the grandfather thought that his little granddaughter could do no wrong.  Apparently she couldn't from that tape.  Sounds like a real trooper.  So I, yeah, I put it on his machine, too.  And I do have this somewhere.  And I've been looking for this damn thing for years, and I just can't find it.  You've got to find that.  It's on an unlabeled reel-to-reel tape, and I just got to find it.  A reel-to-reel.  Well, because I had to transfer it back in the day to get it on the radio.  So I took out my little answer machine tape, brought it to the station, and then transferred it to reel-to-reel so I could get it on the air. 
[01:06:00]  Put Chubby on it.  He'll find it.  Chubby!  That's who!  I've never had an ex do something like that.  Huh?  I've never had an ex do something like that.  Someone said, be honest, Hopi, still had a thing for her, equals still wanting to screw.  Your heart had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, you're probably right.  I don't know.  It's been so long now.  But that was the worst thing I ever did to an ex.  But I don't even think that's that bad.  But she started, so.  Yeah, it's vicious what she did.  I wanted to just move on at that point, because I knew she was just not right in the head to begin with. 
[01:06:30]  Another psycho broad.  You're lucky I wasn't banging her.  You would have gotten one quick message.  Guess what I'm doing?  Was doing.  Beep.  Click.  Let's say hi to Nick in Colorado.  Nick.  Yeah, how you doing, boys?  Hey.  Listen, you guys should play some of that old psycho ex-girlfriend.  All those clips.  They are so good, man.  E-Rock, please tell me you still have those. 
[01:07:00]  I think so, yeah.  Find those today.  Remember that?  Yeah.  This goes way back.  This girl, like, left message after message after message on this guy's answer machine begging this guy to take her back.  And the guy just, what, released him on a website?  This goes back probably eight years.  Just amazing messages.  She was completely out of her mind.  Yeah, she was crazy.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey.  Hey.  Jimmy, a couple minutes ago, you called an ex a scrimshaw whore. 
[01:07:30]  I'm wondering if you were dating a whale and made artwork out of her bones.  Well, that was why I did it, because I had said rickets and scurvy, so I called her a scrimshaw whore.  It was a weak line, and thank you, sir, for bringing it back to the forefront.  I fired out a real dud, and he had to highlight it.  E-Rock found the Psycho X messages, 46 tracks, but we don't have a track listing and don't know if they're clean for CBS.  We have to go through it.  Give me the freaking disc. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, boy.  You just play the first one and see where it goes.  Oh, boy.  What'd we do?  Givens, get ready.  We don't need a polished radio show.  Let's just play the first one and see where it goes.  I don't like this.  Why?  I don't know.  Might not go good.  I have no new messages.  Saved messages.  Saturday, February 3rd, 9-09-EM.  You better fucking call me back.  All right.  Well, that didn't take too long, did it? 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, people are like, okay, scratch that.  All right, E-Rock.  Why don't you go through that?  Yeah.  E-Rock can't win.  Like, if he would have at least handed it to you and not cleaned up, you would have thrown a coffee mug at his teeth for not cleaning it up.  And E-Rock said, I want to get it cleaned up.  And he'd go, you don't know how to do a radio show.  Give me that.  He can't win.  No, he can't.  Oh, that's all right.  Hey, Willem Dafoe is sitting in our green room, so we should take a break and get this big star on the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:09:00]  Stay there.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show in studio.  Wow.  Willem Dafoe.  Very, very excited to have Willem on the radio program.  I don't know if he's excited, but we are.  At least he's being honest.  Like, I've done a million of these. 
[01:09:30]  Let's just get this over with so I can go to the next one.  No.  It's not quite like that.  Promotional things.  I once saw Willem Dafoe downtown, just walking around Mercer Kitchen, to be exact.  And I actually crossed the street because you're a scary, scary man in your movies.  I don't know you personally, but you have that type of an aura about you that I'm like, I don't want contact with this guy.  Really?  I will look at him from the other side of the street. 
[01:10:00]  I suppose it depends on what movie you see.  True.  Well, when you did the turn and started being like the innocent, nice guy in movies, that was awesome because everyone expected you to be the scary guy.  Right, right.  I suppose when I start out, that's what I was mostly doing.  You play a great, nice guy and also a great creep.  You play really well, both like a great psychopath and also like a great hero like in Platoon.  Or in the film we starred in together, Spider-Man.  Oh, yes.  Well, Jimmy was in Spider-Man. 
[01:10:30]  You guys got a film.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah, you know.  A lot of people credited me with basically, it was the turning point in the film.  For those that didn't see it, it was...  Jimmy was billed as Surly Truck Driver.  Yeah.  And he delivered a line.  And we actually have it because we're very proud to have him in a blockbuster movie like that.  So this is his line actually from Spider-Man.  He stinks and I don't like him.  See?  He's the guy that said he stinks and I don't like him when they did the montage of people commenting on Spider-Man. 
[01:11:00]  That was a cool part of the movie.  Yeah.  It's very polite of him too.  I love this guy.  He's actually a great actor.  He's like, yes, I remember that.  You have something in common.  You both didn't like Spider-Man, which is very good.  That's true.  Yeah.  But he had, I think, a few more scenes with him.  Just a couple more.  Just a couple more scenes.  Obviously, you're in some of my favorite movies.  I don't realize how many good movies you're in until I look at the biome.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I just saw Born on the Fourth of July again the other night. 
[01:11:30]  You've done so many great things.  Mississippi Burning, another one of my favorites.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, good.  Yeah.  I know there really was.  Yeah, great.  What do you want from me?  There really was no question there.  I was basically just telling a man I liked that you did that.  You're kissing his ass.  I say thank you.  I want you to add Platoon to that list.  Because I didn't want to do them all at once.  I'm going to run out of great movies.  You're a New York guy?  Living around here?  Yeah.  I've lived here pretty much my adult life.  Because I think everybody has their Willem Dafoe sightings. 
[01:12:00]  Do people come up to you or are they intimidated?  Because I know when I saw you, you were walking by.  I had just left a restaurant.  And I just go, you know, you go, the holy crap, that's Willem Dafoe.  And you want to do something.  You want to kind of step up and say hi or can I get a picture?  But you never know what your vibe is going to be.  People are pretty, people in New York are pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're sweet and they're basically encouraging.  They basically say, you know, say I like what you do or whatever. 
[01:12:30]  They don't ask for much.  And leave you alone, though, for the most part, too?  Yeah.  You know, say hello.  Act like, you know, it's a normal thing and we're good friends.  Yeah.  Because you're pretty recognizable.  I'm around.  Yeah.  You're around.  You lashed out in an article, it says here, and you were saying that people are too obsessed  with the kind of puritanical thing in our society.  You know, what were you?  Yeah, exactly.  These things always need a little context.  No, not misquoted at all.  You know, I was on this talk show and they were talking about a movie, a smaller movie, 
[01:13:00]  and the guy was obsessing on, he made the assumption that it wasn't a successful movie  because it didn't make a lot of money.  And I just said, hey, be careful, you know, don't just look at the grosses and judge the  movie on that.  Some movies aren't meant to make $200 million.  It would be nice if they did, but they're not made for a big audience.  Mass appeal.  Yeah.  Right, right.  And I think those movies are worth making.  That was my point. 
[01:13:30]  So I just said, you know, like ever since grosses started to get printed on movies and all these  magazines kind of sprang up around the business, around the business, everybody thinks they  know the movie business and they follow it like they follow the stock market and they  kind of forget what it's all about.  Right.  That's movies, not just about making money.  Are the scripts bad?  I mean, it seems like...  That's a leading question.  But I mean, like, it seems like we were talking about Pacino yesterday.  I don't know.  Coppola kind of lashed out at Pacino, Nicholson and De Niro. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but I think he took that back.  Oh, did he take it back?  Yeah, because it was out of context.  In fact, I had the occasion to speak to him about that.  Yeah, because that was kind of a weird group of threes to attack.  But I was looking at some of the movies, Pacino and De Niro, and of course, you can't  criticize them as actors, but it just seems like it's the same script getting turned over  and over, which probably means they get to choose what they want to do.  So it's probably just not as many great scripts out there.  Well, for me, you know, you always lament this. 
[01:14:30]  You're always saying, oh, the material ain't great, you know.  But no, I don't think that's particularly true.  The thing that is true is I think there's really big movies and there's really small movies.  And the middle is dropped out.  And it's like anything.  It's, you know, like even like a society that doesn't have a big middle class.  It gets a little shaky.  Yeah.  You know, I think that's true.  But then you try to, you know, I try to do some small ones.  I try to do some big ones. 
[01:15:00]  But the tendency is on the big ones, because they've got to cover their nuts, so to speak.  They've got to know what they're selling.  There's less risk taking.  And so they generally tend to want to repeat themselves, repeat their successes, and use  you the same way that you've been used before.  So it's not always.  Sometimes it's great making a big movie.  But I tend to live in the independent world more where just generally more personal and 
[01:15:30]  more risky films can be made.  It does make sense what you're saying, though.  Like, why do they all have to be judged on box office receipts when, you know, you're  looking at something that's art?  Well, we get sucked into it.  It can be entertainment.  It can be junkie.  It can be art.  It can be all kinds of things.  But I guess my point is there's a fundamental philosophical thing about if something doesn't  make money, you know, we think that if something is in the marketplace, the cream will rise 
[01:16:00]  to the top.  Right.  No, it's not.  It's like, you know, you look at a specialty food store, you know, it's not a big chain  supermarket.  It has different intentions.  I'm amazed that some of these movies come out and the reviews are horrendous.  And then it's number one at the box office.  Like, doesn't the public pay attention and like do a little work on their own?  I think they don't, you know.  And I'm not like saying that the reviews should be, you know, because some of these reviewers  are way off, too.  But when you get a general review and it's very obvious that this is one of these comedies 
[01:16:30]  that's been done a million times and it's awful and it's getting a half a star.  And then you look Monday morning, it's the number one movie at the box office.  You know, those are usually movies where people have a relationship to it and it's got a big  first weekend.  And then after that, it takes a nosedive.  I mean, you create a relationship with people.  But is marketing that powerful, you think?  Yes.  Marketing is huge.  It gets huger and huger.  Because then all the lemmings just go to the movie theater and see this piece of crap.  And how many times have you been in a movie theater and you hear people yelling and screaming  as the credits roll? 
[01:17:00]  Like, oh, that was a bunch of crap.  Yeah.  Some people, you know, sometimes event movies, you know, people, their expectation is very  low, but they'll go anyway because they got to check it out.  Right, right.  Because, you know, it's in the air.  Wait for it to go on DVD or something.  But, you know, the other thing is when people decide what to do, like for a weekend or they  got some free time, sometimes there's a tendency that, you know, you want to go, you want to  know what you're getting.  Right.  If you go with a friend or you go with a girlfriend, you know, you don't want to fight with them 
[01:17:30]  about the meaning of the movie or be traumatized, you know.  So some people kind of like to kick back and kind of do something reassuring and familiar.  What was your favorite movie that no one saw?  Oh, God, that's a tough one.  There's a lot of them.  That was a really good movie and a lot of people should have seen, I'm not talking about  a real obscure artsy piece, but something that really was a solid movie, but because  it didn't have the marketing or the mass appeal, no one went and saw.  Damn, you set me up and I can't think of one right off the bat. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  There's plenty though.  Just because, you know, it's all about timing and awareness and sometimes great movies  slip through the cracks and sometimes really mediocre movies get, you know, elevated and  cold, great.  It's normal.  What's the most intense scene?  I mean, we were talking about a scene the other day.  What's the most intense scene that you've done since you've been doing films?  Oh, God, you know, what comes to mind is always really extreme physical stuff.  I suppose, you know, crucified, being crucified was pretty, pretty intense. 
[01:18:30]  Not just because physically it was difficult, but also no matter how you're brought up, you  know, you have such associations to that.  Right.  That, you know, assume the pose and a lot of, a lot of emotions come with that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Were you on the set now when you, on the, on the last temptation, were you a little bit  pompous to the rest of the people?  Just because.  Pompous?  Well, just because you were posed. 
[01:19:00]  No, the story was about this guy being a regular Joe.  So, you know, pompous, hell no.  I was, I was too busy.  That was a movie.  He, one of the pleasures of that movie is you went out every day and you worked, worked,  worked, worked, worked, and then you worked till you dropped and then you went back to  the little hotel, modest hotel in Morocco, you know, in the place in Morocco and then  woke up and did the same thing.  Were you surprised at all the flack it caught?  Yeah, I was.  I was.  Really?  Yeah, because the, the heart of the movie is very sincere and deals with spiritual stuff 
[01:19:30]  and, uh, you know, on some level it was a very, um, thoughtful movie.  I mean, in this, uh, in an age where, you know, there's slasher movies and stuff like  that, you know, they're, they're objecting to this movie, but because you're, you got  a different take on a familiar story.  Right, right.  It was Christ, uh, what was it?  It was a sexual fantasy about Mary Magdalene or something like that, that, that, that was  what said everybody. 
[01:20:00]  The, uh, that was part of it.  It was, it was more, it was more about just a reinterpretation, uh, trying to, uh, um,  check into the, check into the more, uh, less the divine side and more the human side  of, uh, the Jesus Christ character.  No.  Hey guys, you got to plug this movie.  We're going.  Yes.  We're heading that way.  You have so much history though.  Yeah.  It's really hard to just talk about the talk to you, but I'm thinking, man, it's gotta  be awful that when you come in and you've got so many great films, it's like, everybody 
[01:20:30]  wants to talk about the work.  Um, no, that's, well, the new movie is Animorph and, uh, I'm sorry.  It's all good.  That way we're going.  No, it's fine.  I go, I do gigs on the road and there's nothing worse than when you're like 15 minutes into  an interview, you're like, ah, plug in.  I'm not here to just hang out with you guys.  I know.  We're acting like it's our living room.  Right.  Animorph, it's going to be, um, in theaters Friday and we got copies of this, uh, yesterday.  I checked it out last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A nice serial killer movie there.  Yeah.  I mean, I like dark. 
[01:21:00]  It's very dark.  I like, for me, from an actor's perspective, it's, it's, uh, you know, very much a character  piece.  It's character driven and, uh, there's some very interesting ideas in there and, uh, a  lot of good visual, uh, ideas as well.  Oh, absolutely.  I'll say one thing for it is what you think is going to wind up happening.  Like they're setting something up.  I felt like they were setting something up through the part of the movie and, uh, it's  not what happened, which I kind of liked because I think, oh, okay, I know where this is going  and I didn't know where it was going. 
[01:21:30]  Um, and it really was, I said, you play a great creep cause you came off, even though  you were, you were not supposed to be a creep, you came off really just dark and uncomfortable.  It was really, uh, he's, he's a pretty alienated cat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to explain your character in Animorph?  Uh, well, he's a, he's a, older detective.  He's a police detective, yeah, and he's, he's really comes, well, he's called in to  investigate a series of murders that are eerily similar to a series of murders that he solved  five years earlier. 
[01:22:00]  So, of course, that begs the question whether A, did he get the right guy and B, or whether  it's a copycat.  Copycat, sure.  So, he's got to do some soul searching, and somewhere in his past, he's got some un, he's  got some unresolved things, and it really sends him, as he goes deeper and deeper into the  investigation, he goes deeper and deeper into his past, and, uh, you know, some stuff that  he's never quite fessed up to.  Mm-hmm.  It was really interesting film work. 
[01:22:30]  Um, it really, it just had a really weird, dark, creepy feel to it.  I know that's not a great description, but it really, like.  Yeah, but if you're going to film a serial killer type of movie, that's, that's the way  to go, right?  I, I, yeah, I don't think of it as a serial, I really, I really think it's hung on this  guy's, you know, descent into, uh, a dark past.  Mm-hmm.  And that's what I like about it, and I, I also like it's very, um, it's, it's got a great  New York feel.  Mm-hmm.  It's no accident that we shot it here. 
[01:23:00]  It, it feels like a New York movie we shot in places that are very specifically New York.  Except for the fact, like, uh, you're driving home and you just have a parking space right  in front of your building.  I mean, come on.  That was, that was a little hard to swallow for me, too, but.  What world do you live in?  He just pulls up to his apartment building, oh, parking space in front of the building  once again.  We live in a lucky world.  When a, when a crew controls the traffic, hopefully.  Besides that, yes, very New York.  And there was some great, uh, really some really great, uh, dissembled torsos in this. 
[01:23:30]  There was some really fantastic, yeah, absolutely.  There's some good visual effects.  Yeah, man.  There was some really great, like, pieces of bodies hanging all over.  It was just, like, really revolting.  Some of the, uh, some of the bodies.  Is this, is this what we call a spoiler?  No, not at all.  Not really.  No.  You gotta think that the guy's killing somebody, right?  You know, yeah, the serial killer wasn't, he wasn't, uh, he's smothering them.  I thought of Jimmy when I was watching this movie, because he's a huge fan of serial killers  in general.  This guy knows more about serial killers than anyone I've ever met in my life. 
[01:24:00]  I wouldn't say fans.  He could rattle off names and facts and what his, uh, specialty was.  You know, I was just...  And not the basic ones.  He goes deep.  Yeah?  You really know that stuff.  Yeah, Bundy was a hack.  You know how it is.  You know, I was thinking the other day, uh, doing some press stuff for this.  I, I've got a connection to serial killers because my father knew Ed Gein.  Really?  Wow.  Ed Gein, I guess.  Yeah, he, ooh.  He's a biggie.  He is a biggie.  I grew up in the same town as Ed Gein. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  I have a, this guy, Andrew, made me a coffee mug.  Two Ed Gein coffee mugs.  One had, like, uh, the top half of the victim on it.  And it's actually, like, a really nice piece of art.  And the, and the bottom, it was a painting that he did.  And it had the, the bottom half of the, the victim.  Is he the one that said, and I don't know if this is an accurate quote, uh, when I see  a girl who's pretty, I think two things, what it would be like to date her.  And then the second thing is what her head would look like on a stick.  Like, that was, it might have been him that said that.  Was that him or no?  That was you.  Doesn't sound right.  Okay, no, that sounds like, we can thank Hollywood for that one. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  But I don't know.  No, that was actually in a serial killer book.  One of the guys actually said that.  Hey, baby, you're the expert.  I didn't even know who it was.  It was Ted.  How did your father know him?  Did, were they on the same baseball team or anything like that?  He lived in the same town.  He was like a handyman in the town.  Oh, that is great.  He was handy, all right.  Yeah.  And babysitter, that kind of thing.  A lot of people obsessed with serial killers.  I don't know why, I don't know what that taps into, but I don't know, but we sure have  our share of them in this country, don't we?  Absolutely.  Well, it shows you how far people can go, I think. 
[01:25:30]  It shows you, like, it's like they're never running around with a big funny hat and an  axe.  I mean, it's always like people that live next door to you, and, you know, I think that's  the interesting part is you see how far your fellow citizens can go and how dark and  awful it can, that's what's interesting.  I mean, that's why a movie about them is interesting.  It's just, I don't know.  And I got to bring up something, To Live and Die in L.A., which I thought was a cool  movie.  No, very cool movie.  Yeah.  That scene, you got to kiss a guy in that scene.  Yeah.  In the beginning. 
[01:26:00]  What is that like for an actor when they say, look, you got to kiss this guy?  And it's a pretty passionate kiss.  Yeah, you know, it's, you know, you're playing a scene, what can I say?  Isn't that it?  All a day's work.  Close your eyes and enjoy it.  It just seems like one of those things where you're like, ah, God, it's in the script.  The script looks good, but.  No, the cool thing about that was Billy Friedkin, who's really a great director and really I  loved working with on that.  He, well, maybe I shouldn't tell you this. 
[01:26:30]  No, I can tell you this.  What the hell?  Yeah, we'll promote animals.  Come on, let's go.  It's two shots.  Yeah, yeah.  It's two shots.  And you're tracked behind a guy's back, you know, so it's, it looks like a man, walks like  a man, everything like a man.  And then you see me go up and greet him with a smile and give him this deep kiss.  And then the camera turns around and it's revealed as a woman.  As a woman, right.  It's two shots, but we have to start the kiss in the one shot. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And this poor guy that was a guy that I kissed was a dancer, a straight guy, very, very, probably  all his life, um, you know, having to assert that he's straight comes from a world where  a lot of people are gay.  You know, so the guy was unusually uptight about this and it, the director says, Oh,  don't worry about it.  It's no big deal.  He'll just come up to your face and then we'll cut. 
[01:27:30]  And then Billy goes over to me and says, kiss the shit out of him.  It does look extremely uncomfortable and unnatural the way like the hand goes to the back of the  head.  It looks like they're not really into this until you see that scene cut and, and you  notice that it's a woman, uh, and then it looks a little more natural and like people are enjoying  themselves a little more, but, uh, and you do play quite the, uh, quite the bastard in 
[01:28:00]  that movie.  To live and die in LA is a great place.  Yeah.  You haven't seen it.  You know, that's a really good one.  You were talking about movies.  I mean, how weird success or not success is.  When that movie opened, it was a big flop.  Really?  And it really survived only later, uh, you know, videos and after life.  Yeah.  And, and also became, at least in my experience, uh, uh, popular among film people and film  directors.  It was an important movie early in my career, but it was a real flop. 
[01:28:30]  And I remember what the reviews said and it was interesting.  They'd say, there are no people to root for.  There are no people to identify with.  This is a world full of scum.  And I thought, well, that, that prefigured, you know, uh, Quentin Tarantino world by like  10 years, you know?  Yeah.  That's, uh, there's nothing wrong with that.  No.  What the hell?  Yeah.  We watch movies like that all the time.  You get bothered by bad reviews?  You know, I, you read them at this point. 
[01:29:00]  I do.  I try not to read them.  I really don't because a lot of times, you know, uh, because of the short form and because  the level is very low, the critical writing on film is quite low usually, but sometimes  I read them because if it's very good, people are telling you about it.  You want to check it out.  If it's very bad, people are telling you about it and you want to check it out because usually  and then you can decide for yourself.  So it's like the not knowing is worse, but generally speaking, I, you know, I like to know 
[01:29:30]  how it's going, what the response was, but I don't read them.  It's too, it's too depressing.  It, it can, it can stick in your head.  That's interesting because you have nothing to prove as far as your, uh, film career goes,  but, but it's not, it's nice to know you're your last five minutes.  Well, yeah, it's nice to know you're human, you know, cause we're affected by message board  postings and what some idiot says about us in a dumb local man.  Don't, don't go there.  I mean, you could drive yourself nuts. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Cause, um, also particularly with the internet, you know, you got, the internet is mostly  run by 12 year old kids, you know, everyone's an expert, everyone's an expert, or at least  cops pretending to be, and you can tell by the spelling and the syntax and all that, you  know, that these are kids, you know, and, and stuff gets in the internet and just sticks  there and kind of festers.  So what was, go ahead, Jimmy.  I'll say what's one that got to you?  There had to be one that was written by a critic that who you, you legitimately wanted 
[01:30:30]  to strangle because it didn't, there's, there's, there's lots of them, but one I can think  of particularly was, uh, I made a, uh, a small personal film on another one of these movies  that I, that I was not a, you know, going to reach a huge audience and a critic, um, for  variety, reviewed it at the Venice film festival.  And it was, uh, it was a movie, a small movie, an art movie.  And it was like, it got under her skin and she just did everything to kill it. 
[01:31:00]  And early in, uh, uh, uh, in, uh, the life of a movie, sometimes a prominent review can  really hurt it.  And she sort of willfully knew that.  And she killed the distribution basically on the movie because of a very, very negative,  one person necessarily negative review.  Wow.  Yeah.  But you can cry about this stuff.  It's, it's called before it had a name and, uh, you can get it on a video, but, um, it 
[01:31:30]  didn't really get much of a release here, but you, you got to be careful because they  recut it in, uh, in most of the, uh, most of the videos here, but, uh, outside of this  country, it's our cut.  Right, right.  Gotcha.  So you must hate her guts.  I mean, I, I don't, I hate whose guts?  Exactly.  That awful woman.  Yeah.  Variety.  Yeah.  I, I, you know, to set it up, I should have told you more, but then let's forget this. 
[01:32:00]  I should have gone there, but she stays with me, huh?  Yeah, she should.  She stinks.  I hate critics.  I hate them.  Willem, uh, obviously you did a lot of-  She's a would-be filmmaker too.  Of course she is.  You obviously did a lot of huge, uh, films.  What's, what's your favorite film that you did?  Oh God, you know, I, uh, people ask me and I, I can't, I, I don't know.  You can't even choose one?  No, I really can't.  One that's up there?  No, you know, your name's-  They're all your babies?  I'm afraid.  You like them all? 
[01:32:30]  It's afraid, yeah, it's true.  And the other thing I remember is once I heard some guy, a guy who I wasn't crazy about, he had a movie, he had a movie that I thought this time, wow, he really did something beautiful.  And I heard him on some talk show or something trashing that movie.  And I thought, oh, babe, you ruined it for me.  I was fine with that.  It's the other stuff that I can't bear.  So, it's like, what I think isn't important, what I think you put into the work, and then, you know, one man's meat is another man's poison, so I don't want to guide anybody by telling them what I like. 
[01:33:00]  Right on.  Yeah, I liked American Psycho, I thought it was a hysterical movie, hysterically funny movie.  Beautifully made movie, but when you say something like that, that's something that, I think it's a great movie, but I didn't feel, you know, central to it, it's not hung on me.  I tend to be proudest of the ones that turn out well where I'm a central figure.  Sure, or I have a strong part, you know. 
[01:33:30]  Platoon was an important movie for its time, especially.  It was kind of one of the first in the Vietnam genre that kind of showed it a little more realistically.  It's true.  And it was a personal movie, and it was real fresh, because, you know, this movie, and when we were out there, you know, you looked around,  and most, I had only made a couple of movies, and most of the people around had made no movies,  so it had a real freshness to it, and passion from Oliver, because that was a very personal story. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Have you ever been embarrassed in a, because, I mean, I've been very few small, awful films.  Literally, I've probably been in three of the four worst films ever done.  Tell me.  One was called White Chicks Incorporate.  It's so bad.  Sounds good.  I can't even watch it, like, ironically.  Like, uh-huh.  Okay.  And we were in the-  What did you do in that?  Oh, I played such an ass.  A boss or something?  What's that?  A boss?  No, no, no.  I played famous comedian Jim Norton, where I had to, like, act like I was just a big comedian. 
[01:34:30]  I was really humiliating.  Sounds good.  Yeah, yeah.  I believe it.  I'd rather describe a pedophilia testimony than what I'm telling you.  And I was in this little theater watching this premiere, and I wanted to commit suicide.  It was so embarrassing to watch myself.  Like, have you ever been watching it or watching the work they did with the film and just wanted  to just get out?  No.  Sometimes you get disappointed on, you know.  Oh, it came out?  Yeah.  Sure you do.  And, you know, it's always a game.  You know, you got people, and they fail you, and they surprise you. 
[01:35:00]  You know, it's fun.  Because you make this little family around this thing for a while, and some people step  up to the plate, and other people kind of fall on their face.  And so you're proud when they do, and when they don't, you know, you say, eh, it's too  bad.  See, he's got a couple of huge movies there, Jimmy, to look back on when he's looking at  one that maybe isn't one that he's most proud of.  You have Side Splitters, if you want to.  Which is a 20-minute just work of art. 
[01:35:30]  It's kind of like Platoon, but 20 minutes with me and stupid Louis Black.  But no, it's interesting to ask somebody who's got such a body of work, like, is there  times where, because I don't have a body of film work.  You know, I've got a couple of small, awful ones, and I'm not really an actor.  But it's got it.  You have to know.  Like you said, you know.  You have to know when you're watching.  You're like, oh, this is just not what I wanted.  Yeah, sometimes.  You know, and it's rough, because you make something, and then someone else orders it and turns it into  something else.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  So sometimes they can help you out and make you look good.  Other times they can sink something beautiful that was there.  So, you know, it's a trust game and a risk game.  Hey, did you get to see Madonna's, you know, Private, when you filmed that scene?  Whoa!  Hell, man.  Did you get a little peek?  Did you get a little peek?  Give us a little something here.  Because she seems to be a little bit on the, let's really do this.  Ah, she's cool.  That means she's method. 
[01:36:30]  No, it wasn't like that, but it was, yeah.  Well, you got a big smile on your face, so there's something there.  Hey, the new movie's Animorph.  It starts tomorrow, I believe, right?  It's in theaters.  IFC.  It's going to be in New York, obviously.  Where else is it going to be?  It says limited release.  Very limited at this point.  It's at IFC, you know, on 6th Avenue in New York.  And then it opens in L.A. in a couple of weeks.  And I'm sure if it does well, it'll go wider because they have other theaters. 
[01:37:00]  But also, they're doing an interesting thing.  They've got this on-demand thing.  Yeah.  Through cable, which is a big deal because it allows independent film to go places that it normally wouldn't get shown.  So this is one of those movies?  Because on my movies on demand, you can watch some of these films that are in theaters.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what they're doing.  At the same time.  That's pretty cool.  It's very cool because then you don't have to wait for the DVD.  So if you're hot to see something, you can see it now.  And also, for these movies that don't get a huge release, you know, it lets people see it. 
[01:37:30]  Although, you know, it's obviously always a better experience in the theater from my...  Although the technology's starting to look a little old in movie theaters.  We all have our flat screens and a little system and...  Yeah, okay.  They really got to update the theaters.  It's so frustrating.  Well, they're working on it.  I know.  But I saw a screening last night and I thought, wow, could you see...  Well, yeah, very good on...  This movie's very good visually. 
[01:38:00]  And it's a very laid-back, very tap-down performance.  And I thought, gee, on a little screen, would you see the performance?  Because it's all in the eyes.  Right on.  Animorph.  Once again, the movie, what is it about for the people that are just tuning in to the Willem Dafoe interview?  Okay, it's about a detective that's investigating a series of murders that are very much like a series of murders that he solved years ago.  And it puts some doubts in his mind and kind of forces him to go back into some questions he had about some things that he did in the past. 
[01:38:30]  So it's something of a ghost story, I mean, in the respect that he confronts himself.  Right.  It's really dark and there are some really weird, creepy scenes in it.  But I'm not saying that in a very good way.  No, no, I'm not saying that in a bad way.  It's a serial killer movie.  It shouldn't be like yellow balloons in the corner.  It was a very dark, interesting movie.  Even the corner is a creep.  It was just...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he was just a creepy guy.  I love him. 
[01:39:00]  Paul Lazar.  And you walk right in without putting the stuff under your nose.  You just don't care.  I love that.  Yeah, you're just right in there with the corner checking things out.  She's got her coat on.  That means you've got to get to another interview.  All right.  It's the great Willem Dafoe.  We're all huge fans, obviously.  And thanks for stopping by.  Okay, enjoy talking to you.  The movie's Animorph starting tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  There's always controversy after the big Hollywood interview. 
[01:39:30]  Travis ran in here.  Club Soda Kenny ran in here.  Roland confirmed it.  But the publicist had a little problem with our interview there.  Travis?  The interview as a whole was fine.  She just definitely didn't like that Madonna question you asked her.  Oh, big deal.  Relax.  It wasn't that bad.  She said, where's Roland?  Get Roland in here.  You didn't like it.  Oh, no.  I had no problem with it.  She started yelling, get Roland in here?  Yeah.  And Roland knew the second I went to get him.  He's like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Did she say something like, that better be the only what? 
[01:40:00]  She said, is that going to be the only crude question you asked?  Crude.  What's crude about that?  Madonna's been known to be a slut for her entire career, so I would assume that Madonna  would probably do that scene from Body of Evidence in the Raw.  And it wasn't even that bad of a question to ask if you got to see her naked.  I mean, that's, I mean, like, did you see her?  That's a guy thing, man.  Yeah.  We all want to know.  He didn't have a problem with the kissing the guy question, so, you know.  Well, that's a nice guy.  He didn't want to say anything vulgar about Madonna.  That's fine.  But it's like, we have to ask.  I mean, how would you not ask that question?  Did you see her, Mia? 
[01:40:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Ah.  You know?  Why not?  Why not?  Look like a Wally.  So, whatever.  I was saying before, during the commercials, that people don't understand what we go through  during these interviews.  Because there are questions you ask, you want to ask, and then you've got to scope things  out.  Like, before I asked him about the kissing the guy question, I looked down and noticed  he had a wedding ring on. 
[01:41:00]  So, I was like, all right, that's safe.  Because then you're thinking, I don't know Willem Dafoe.  I don't know his sexual preference.  You know, what if it turned out he got offended by that because I was thinking it was a big  deal.  And he's like, you know, no, what's so bad about that?  And as soon as you went down that road, I'm like, oh, my God.  The old dirt road.  Oh, my God.  Obviously, Willem Dafoe's not gay or anything, but you never know when you go down the gay  road or some of these people that come in.  Yeah, just using that as an example.  Yeah, you can't, like, bash.  But you did your quick little observations and you saw a wedding ring and all that. 
[01:41:30]  Because I'm just waiting for that day.  What's wrong with being gay?  You homophobe.  Jeez, I'm leaving.  The publicist freaks out.  Oh, my God.  It's a mess.  I wanted to ask a question.  And we just got sidetracked.  I wanted to ask, when you do that scene, do you worry if your breath is fresh?  With a guy.  Honestly, like, is that a normal thing that would occur to you?  I don't know if it would for me.  It might.  It might. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  I know Will Smith wouldn't kiss.  No?  Six Degrees of Separation.  Oh, he had to.  Right, right.  And Donald Sutherland.  I don't think he did a kissing scene.  I think he was supposed to and he didn't.  Or he just didn't do it.  Oh, Willem Dafoe is one of those guys.  We don't get many of them.  They're way up there, man.  Yeah.  They're way up there.  Right?  Yeah.  Huge star.  We're all huge fans of Willem Dafoe.  He's like the real thing, man.  He's like, he's not only a big star, but he's like a bonafide.  He's like one of the greats.  And everything he does is good. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  In person, he's a likable guy, he smiles a lot and all, but man, on film, he is a scary  dude.  Well, he's kind of changed, though, over the years from being just a ghoul.  Like, people, he was really just only played bad guys.  He was typecast as the bad guy.  And now he's got, like, you know, kind of a leading man thing going.  But, I mean, Streets of Fire, he was a maniac.  Remember when he came running it with the sledgehammer fight? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And he's got his mouth open and he's running down the street looking like a lunatic.  Here's a question for you.  So, he played the same type of person on film.  What was the first movie where he was the innocent nice guy?  Like, I couldn't remember offhand.  But, well, Platoon, he was, I wouldn't say innocent, but he was the...  Oh, he was, yeah, a nice guy.  He was pretty much a nice guy in a bad situation.  But there was a...  I can't remember.  But there was one of these films where he went, wow, Willem Dafoe is actually, like, 
[01:43:30]  you know, the good guy in a film.  And I remember thinking, that's really strange, because he used to him being the bad guy.  Yeah, wow, I can't think of that movie.  I know.  Maybe we should have done the research while he was in here.  Yeah, maybe.  Just a thought.  Stupid publicists, though.  Oh, and I know Roland's freaking out, like, I don't, don't say anything bad about the  publicists.  It's a hard enough time dealing with them.  I understand.  But, I mean, come on.  They got to loosen up and let a guy just sit there and converse like a guy with other guys. 
[01:44:00]  Of course.  Of course.  It's amazing.  We weren't even trying to be shocking.  No.  Casually.  What's wrong, Travis?  Is Willem still here?  No.  I asked Roland if he had a comment, and he said, no, he's just going to sit in the office  in Pussville and not say anything.  Why?  Oh, because he doesn't want to come in and make problems.  Well, he's the one that has to clean up our messes.  But there's no mess.  There really isn't on this one.  It was pretty innocent.  Whatever.  We liked the guy very much, and we respect him very much.  And what a stupid fanboy I sounded like. 
[01:44:30]  Like, I loved Born on the Fourth of July and Mississippi Burning, and I just stopped.  Like, there was supposed to be fodder for great conversation.  And he's like, okay.  You were just stating facts.  I'm just an ass.  I'm an ass.  Animorphs, the new movie that comes out tomorrow.  Limited release.  Yep.  All right.  Vince McMahon.  The Pope's in town.  And it was brought to our attention that good old Vince McMahon thinks he's God as well,  or has a close association with God.  What's the angle here, Sam? 
[01:45:00]  Well, basically, a couple years ago, Shawn Michaels is a born-again Christian, legitimately.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Like, when he came back to wrestling, he was a born-again Christian.  Was that a storyline?  No.  How do you know?  Do you hang out with the McMahons?  Well, I would like to, but no.  But no, they did, like, a whole thing about it even before he was on TV again.  It was in his book and all this stuff.  But so McMahon, like, two years ago, he's feuding with Shawn Michaels,  and says, Shawn Michaels is going to have to face Vince and Shane McMahon, 
[01:45:30]  and Shawn Michaels' tag team partner will be God.  And then McMahon started going off.  Boring.  I'm just trying to set it up.  Boring.  And he went into a church, and he did this.  He did this?  Yeah.  To set up the big match?  Yeah.  All right.  God, it's me, Mr. McMahon.  You know, when you think about it, we have a lot in common.  You created the world.  I created world wrestling entertainment. 
[01:46:00]  You created Adam and Eve.  And I created Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hulk Hogan, and people like that.  Let's face it.  I mean, on the seventh day, you rusted.  Quite frankly, I don't believe in a day off, which means that I may have actually a stronger  work ethic than you do.  And he's doing this in a church, an actual church. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  With his son next to him.  I wonder if God ever lost a copyright logo case.  Yeah.  That happened there.  I wonder if God ever got his ass buffed.  When he first walked into the church, he took the holy water, and he put it in his mouth,  and then he did the Triple H thing where he spits it up into the air.  Did he really?  Yeah.  What the hell is he thinking?  It's crazy.  I'm bigger than God.  Bigger than God. 
[01:47:00]  That's right.  Stone Cold Steve Austin, I want you to build an ark.  I don't know how big.  It's got to be a few cubits.  You need to build an ark.  That's quite a few cubits.  And put in, I don't want animals two by two.  I want gorgeous babes in there.  Yeah, hot chicks.  I was thinking you would just want tag teams on your ark.  Tag teams, two by two.  Nothing but tag teams. 
[01:47:30]  An ark match.  An ark filled with tag teams.  I wish I could name a few, but.  When I came down with those Ten Commandments.  Yeah.  Because I'm every holy man.  Not even just God, I'm every holy man.  No chance.  No chance in hell.  No chance in hell.  I'm the Pope.  I'm the Bishop.  I'm every holy man.  And when I came down with the Ten Commandments. 
[01:48:00]  Thou shalt buy tickets for WrestleMania.  Thou shalt go to every venue we perform at.  In world wrestling entertainment.  More Vince from the church.  Hope you're still listening, God.  My commandments.  Thou am the boss.  And there are no other bosses before me. 
[01:48:30]  Thou shalt not tell me to move on.  Thou shalt not take thy s*** and douse it into my face.  Thou shalt not cross thy arms and yell.  Thou shalt not cross thy arms and douse it into my face and shove it up into my s*** cavity.  He's in a church. 
[01:49:00]  Come on, that's a set.  They can't be in a church.  They wouldn't allow that.  That's an elaborate set if it's a set.  I know he has the money, but it really looks just like a church.  Didn't you see my powers at WrestleMania?  No, I did not.  I let loose my fiery wrath on 40 WrestleMania attendees.  Yet I blinded stupid E-Rock to it.  He didn't even know what was going on.  Fire and brimstone were all over people as they ran for their lives. 
[01:49:30]  But E-Rock just wanted garlic butter slaw.  Didn't see a thing, did you, E-Rock?  Didn't see it.  I blinded his eyes.  Yeah, that's right.  I can turn water into steak martinis.  For E-Rock.  Hey, God.  Kiss my ass!  I'm calling you God now.  Maybe I should call you Angry Vince. 
[01:50:00]  Do you have anything to say to Adam and Eve?  I don't know.  Call me God.  Yeah, bite that apple.  Come on, go ahead, bite that apple.  Wow.  I gave you free will.  Now bite that apple.  Go ahead, bite it.  You're cast out.  That's right, you're cast out.  Angry Vince, what about the Pope?  He's in town, you know?  Yeah, another.  He's a fake holy man.  What do you mean he's a fake holy man?  I'm bigger than the Pope.  He's getting a lot of attention, though.  I want to abuse the Pope and the Undertaker in a Popemobile match. 
[01:50:30]  A Popemobile match.  We drive around town in that little Popemobile, and they're kicking each other's ass.  That's right, kicking each other's asses in the Popemobile.  Angry Vince, I always wanted to know the answer to this question.  There was, like, footprints in the sand, and then also, I don't know, like, there were  two sets of footprints, and then there was one.  That's right.  It's confusing.  During a person's life, they'll see two sets of footprints. 
[01:51:00]  In the sand.  One is mine, and one is theirs.  Right, sure.  And then during the toughest times in their life, they only see one set of footprints.  Why would you leave them like that?  Because I have things to do.  I'm a busy man.  I'm a busy man.  I have a world wrestling entertainment.  I don't care.  Carry yourself.  And the parting of what?  The Red Sea, was it?  What was that about?  Parting of the Red Sea.  What was that about?  That was so I could walk some Jews through it. 
[01:51:30]  Really?  I had to get the Jews out of Egypt.  They were being enslaved.  And I tried to make them wrestlers, and that failed miserably.  You can't find a wrestling Jew.  But they're great with my accounting.  I'm making money hand over fist.  I made any accountants for the world wrestling entertainment.  But a Jew can't fight.  Except that Goldberg.  Goldberg was a battling Jew. 
[01:52:00]  That's right.  A battling Jew.  We're going to have a yarmulke match.  Yarmulke match.  The first person to knock off the other Jews, yarmulke wins.  That's right.  More Vince McMahon in the church.  Shawn Michaels, at Backlash, I will unleash the apocalypse on you.  If I'm lying, if I'm lying, may God strike up me down as I stand here before you. 
[01:52:30]  Well, it appears as though Shawn Michaels' tag team partner has forsaken him.  So, therefore, praise be the name of Backlash.  Must it be the name of Vincent Kennedy McLean? 
[01:53:00]  Backlash.  That's right.  I want you two to have a crown of thorns match.  A crown of thorns?  Crown of thorns match.  The loser has to carry a cross up the ramp with fireworks going off.  No, that would...  Carry that cross.  No, that would...  With a bunch of fireworks.  Angry Vince, that would get a lot of people pissed off.  No, it wouldn't.  I'm God.  But you can't do that. 
[01:53:30]  I'm God now.  I can say whatever I want.  You can't do that.  With impunity.  I'm infallible.  You can't do that on Raw.  Infallible like the Pope.  You're going to get Bill Donahue up your, you know what, if you do something like that.  A crucifixion match.  No, you can't do that.  With real nails.  That's right.  Can you see Shawn Michaels being nailed up on a cross?  I could.  Crucifixion match.  And three days later, he's got to rise from the dead and come out of a cave and have a 
[01:54:00]  cage match.  But he's going to be tired.  That's right.  You're going to be tired, but you're going to get in there.  Get in the cage.  Hey, what about this, I think, turning this water into wine?  Man, what's that all about?  That's impossible.  That's like hocus pocus stuff.  It is not.  It is.  You're saying that's not real? 
[01:54:30]  That's hocus pocus.  I've done it myself, and you can barely see the edit.  Like my blowing up limo.  I live through a limo blowing up.  You can see the edit where my foot hangs out the door, and then it's not.  Triple H said there was no edit.  Well, Triple H is stupid.  But he's married to your daughter, sir.  That's right.  And I hope they immaculately conceived a child.  Because the thought of him putting his... 
[01:55:00]  Hold on.  Putting his s*** in my little girl's s*** makes me sick.  That's right.  It makes me sick.  I've seen him in the locker room.  He's got a huge s***.  And I should know I made it because I'm God.  I'm God.  I'm God.  I ask we all pray now.  Yeah.  Thanks, Fred, from Brooklyn.  To St. Jay Strongbow.  What happened to him?  All of my saints.  Dead wrestlers. 
[01:55:30]  He is dead, right?  I don't think so.  St. Jay Strongbow.  Why couldn't I pick a dead wrestler?  Why?  Thanks.  You screwed my bit up, you ass.  Kiss my ass.  That's right.  Kiss my ass.  He is dead.  He is dead.  Hey, Vince.  There's a lot of guys that think that Earth is only 6,000 years old and that dinosaurs were  actually dragons.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Who the hell would think that? 
[01:56:00]  Who told you that?  Jesse the Apostle Ventura?  Thank you, Macho Libre.  Gotta give him credit.  What about St. Andre the Giant?  St. Andre.  You know, in the Bible, there's a story of when David slew him with a sling and a rock.  Hit him in the head and he fell down.  It was a rock match.  A sling match.  That's what we'll do.  That's right. 
[01:56:30]  And maybe someone go in the audience and hit some of you people.  Don't boo me.  Don't boo me, audience.  You're the only reason.  I'm the only reason you're here.  I created you.  Who are your disciples?  I'm a little confused.  My disciples?  Yeah.  Well, the king was.  The king?  The king.  The king.  I don't mean Jesus.  I mean the king.  The idiot that sat there and did the commentary.  Oh.  I thought you were thinking King Kong Bundy or something.  No.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Jerry Lawler.  Sure.  Yes, I did meet the little Hulkster in heaven.  And I threw him out and now he's in hell.  Why?  Would you do that?  Because the Hulk made a stupid song about him.  Big leg dropping fag.  You don't like the leg drop, sir?  I hate the leg drop.  It's kind of stupid, huh?  I think I'm going to give the Hulk diabetes so he loses his legs. 
[01:57:30]  He'll do stump drops.  That's right.  Now you're going to do stump drops from the top rope.  Climb up with your teeth.  I don't care.  Angry Vince, before we let you go, the Last Supper.  Yeah.  What was that like?  That was a tag team.  Actually, that was a battle royal.  No, it wasn't.  After the eight.  They had a battle royal where they threw each other off the table.  We've all seen the picture.  You're all sitting on the same side of the table.  It looks like a nice affair. 
[01:58:00]  Triple H actually lays someone out and the table breaks and whines all over the place.  No, that's not how it went.  It made a big mess.  That's right.  A big mess.  That's not how it went.  You had a very nice dinner.  No.  Yes.  It was a mess when the table broke.  It was done in a ring.  If the painting was pulled out a little bit, you'd see the ropes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then some jackass flew off the top rope.  Any thoughts on the Virgin Mary, Angry Vince?  She was no virgin. 
[01:58:30]  She was no...  I'll tell you that much.  You can't say that.  Shane O' Mac.  Shane O' Mac f***ed her good.  No, you can't say that.  That's right, Shane O' Mac.  You can't say that.  You're going to get a lot of people very pissed off.  There's a lot of Catholics listening right now.  You've got no chance.  This is some of the worst dead wrestlers I've ever seen, Iraq.  You've got no chance.  All right.  Well, thank you, Angry Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  I'm going to need help curing my laryngitis. 
[01:59:00]  That's right.  I'm going to have laryngitis.  The Messiah Man, Randy Savage.  Thank you, Boomer.  What about crying wrestling fan?  We play that clip on our show a lot.  He's a fruit.  Why is he?  What a crybaby.  Why?  What a crybaby.  But it's still real to that guy.  It's still real to him, goddammit. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  He took my name in vain.  Well, you're not God.  You think you're God.  Chris Benoit walked out his garage three days later.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Are you crazy?  Yes.  Oh, that hit a nerve.  It's okay, because it's in character.  I'm doing it in character.  I know we have to let you go before you lose your voice, but I do have an idea for you.  Yeah.  You could get all the religious icons.  You could get Buddha and Moses and Muhammad, I mean. 
[02:00:00]  A religious icon match.  Get them all in the ring.  That's right.  A little battle royale.  Beating the crap out of each other.  Who would you get in there?  You got Buddha, also known as King Kong Bundy.  Who else?  Buddha could use that big belly and pin people against the corner and then turn around and  put his big, fat Buddha right in his face.  That's right.  Give him a stink face. 
[02:00:30]  Buddha's not going to give anyone a stink face.  Buddha will give Muhammad a stink face.  He doesn't need to get in one of your first things.  Right when he's ready to pin him, Muhammad's going to blow up the bombs he has strapped  to him.  What?  That's right.  It's a suicide bomber.  No.  He doesn't need to do that.  He gets other people to do that.  Jesus is going to run head first into people with his crown of thorns.  Why would he do that?  That's right.  He's going to beat people in the face with a crown of thorns.  Why would he do that?  Make him bleed.  Why would he do that?  There's no need for that. 
[02:01:00]  And then, oh my goodness, is this going to be great.  Yeah.  That wacky Indian god is going to punch six people at a time with all those arms.  Six arms in an elephant trunk or something.  I wish we knew more religions for this bit.  And you should see the fireworks when Zeus comes out.  Zeus comes out to some real fireworks, lightning bolts that strike people down.  Forty people dead, and E-Rock doesn't notice. 
[02:01:30]  Well, they didn't die.  Forty minor injuries.  Why couldn't it be E-Rock?  In an idiot match.  Yes, and then we'll bring in Zinu.  Zinu?  Zinu from Scientology.  Oh, man.  He's going to get his ass kicked right away because he's new at this.  Ha ha ha.  And stupid.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha. 
[02:02:00]  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Yes.  Oh, and heart fell from grace in a few other places.  What happened?  You don't like that, Sam?  No, that's it.  Sam takes these things very seriously.  I'm God.  I knew it was going to happen before it happened.  So why didn't you stop?  I couldn't.  Free will.  Ha ha ha ha.  That's it.  Free will.  I tell you to get up on the harness.  Yeah.  And then if you fall, oh well.  Sorry.  No chance in hell. 
[02:02:30]  No chance in hell.  Angry Vince McMahon.  Tag team of the black Israelites.  They're going to kick some ass and yell about how they're Jews, but they're black and confuse everybody.  That stupid audience will be holding up signs.  What?  I don't even get this.  They're black, but Jewish?  Stop it.  Well, maybe they just run the sun too long.  I don't know.  Rowdy Roddy Pontius Pilate. 
[02:03:00]  No, that's not his name.  It's his new name.  It's his new name.  Well, Danny and Buffalo.  I'm going to drink some Gatorade.  Hold on.  All right.  Oh.  Danny and Buffalo writes.  Ugh.  Where's Danny and Buffalo?  Wow, that hurts.  He writes, I guess God needed a blue blazer.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's not nice.  What about a jihad match?  A jihad match. 
[02:03:30]  Jihad is all the rage.  What do you think?  A jihad match?  I like it.  We get some savages in there with pipe bombs.  And then we get some, you know, regular normal people, as I like to call them.  Yeah.  And we see who wins.  A beheading match.  No, that's.  No?  No.  No.  You know how they could be.  Suicide vest match.  They meet in the middle, blow each other up.  No.  40 people in the audience die, and he rocks blind.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Come on.  Eddie Guerrero hotel bathroom match.  No.  No.  We usually send these tapes to Vince McMahon.  Yes, they can be edited, stupid.  All right.  God will edit these so Vince can listen and not hate us.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We have to take a break.  An Israeli bus match.  You can't do that. 
[02:04:30]  Yes, we can.  That would really piss off a lot of people.  Angry Vince, everyone.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Sam's freaking out that we haven't taken a break.  In 40 minutes.  A commercial match.  Yeah.  And why is someone writing, see you guys in two years?  Why don't we take a break?  Regroup.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton's going to be at Caroline's in New York City all weekend long.  Starting tonight, Jimmy.  Tonight through Sunday, man.  Thanks.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-0.  In a comedy match. 
[02:05:00]  I want to thank Angry Vince McMahon for stopping by today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's always a pleasure to have him.  Oh, yeah.  We did a lot today.  Once again, we want people, for the people out there that have a sick sense of humor,  make sure you put in Remove Your Hat on YouTube.  But you've got to have a really, really, really sick sense of humor.

[02:07:00]  on this show.  But now it's this really, really funny piece of comedy.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Why is Kenny running into the studio?  Traffic and weather on the eights with Club Soda Kenny.  I love that inspirational introduction.  Hi, Kenny.  Hello, people.  It's Club Soda Kenny with your Opie and Anthony traffic and weather on the eights.  Yeah.  In Connecticut, there's an accident on I-95 northbound in Greenwich. 
[02:07:30]  It's being cleared up from the shoulder, and traffic is slow.  But in the Fairfield area, it didn't start out on the shoulder, but it sure wound up there.  There's reports of body parts everywhere.  Does that make you happy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In New York City, there's an accident on the Queensbound Triborough Bridge, and the left  lane is blocked just before the span.  Rubbernecking delays go past the toll plaza because people love to slow down and look at 
[02:08:00]  disasters.  In Manchester, New Jersey...  They're slowing down out the window here.  No kidding.  No kidding.  Everyone in their jet cars.  Yeah.  And they're flying cars are going by this window right now.  Manchester, New Jersey, Route 70's closed in both directions due to an accident involving  a car and a tractor trailer.  It ain't no puzzle who won that one. 
[02:08:30]  Guess who ain't coming home for dinner?  Holy jetties.  What?  I'm just reporting the facts.  All right.  And now I got some Syracuse traffic.  It's slow traffic on Buckley Road northbound between Elwood Davis Road and Patricia Drive.  All traffic will be diverted to the southbound lane on the bridge over I-90.  That's a bridge over Troubled Waters.  He stops and looks around at everybody like waiting for a reaction. 
[02:09:00]  I'm killing here.  Crews working on the Tinker Tavern Road bridge on I-81 northbound between Highway 104.  And did you hear me?  The Tinker Tavern Road.  Nothing.  I've never wanted Charles Whitman to show up in the studio more than I do right now.  Someone is calling this segment Tragedy and Horror on the 8th. 
[02:09:30]  That's a better title.  I'm going to have to work that into this bit.  Intermittent traffic signal work on US-20, both eastbound and westbound between Highway 92 and Syracuse Road.  And the flag people will be directing traffic.  So have a nice day, Syracuse.  And now for Grand Rapids, Michigan weather.  It's going to be a bad day because there's no tornado warnings, no thunderstorm warnings, no flash flood warnings, and no special marine warnings. 
[02:10:00]  But on the bright side, it'll be cloudy, humid, and with little visibility.  And that's been the Opie and Anthony Club Soda Candy traffic and weather on the 8th.  What about Jim Norton?  Brought to you, sponsored by Jim Norton at Caroline's this weekend.  Tickets are on sale now.  I suddenly, you turn me around.  Yeah, all of a sudden, Jimmy really likes that bit. 
[02:10:30]  Club Soda Candy, everyone.  I thought we were going to have an example of how it's done, the right way.  Do we have that?  Like, it doesn't, oh wow, it's four minutes though?  Oh, forget it.  We don't have time.  Maybe tomorrow.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  We got music for you as you leave the studio.  There's a man who leads a life of danger. 
[02:11:00]  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  With every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[02:11:30]  Beware of pretty faces that you find.  A pretty face can hide an evil mind.  I'll be careful what you say, or you'll give it all away.  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.  Here he goes. 
[02:12:00]  Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Is this the chorus?  Yeah.  I thought a little lead went here or something.  A little more Secret Agent Man there, right? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, but there's another verse, but I don't know when to start.  Hold the direction, hold the direction for this big dumb thumb moving.  Here it comes, Secret Agent.  Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Giving you a number and taking away your name.  Swinging on the Riviera one day. 
[02:13:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.

[02:14:30]  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Hello everyone  This is Opie  That's Anthony  Hi  And Jimmy's somewhere  Jimmy is going to be leaving the show  To tape a fine segment for Good Morning America  Is that what he's doing?  So he'll be stepping out for a little bit  Little bit, little bit, yeah  That was a lot of fun today  Yes  Whoa  I just got a communique from Brother Wee's 
[02:15:00]  Who's down there in Disney hell  He's got a couple young kids  Even though he's an older gentleman  He decided to have a few kids late in life  Late in life children  Even though he has like  He has a daughter that's  Very grown up  And then he's got two that  One is out of high school  The other is  I think getting ready to leave high school  And then he's got like a 
[02:15:30]  Like a  Like a seven and five  Oh wow  Yeah that's a pretty big gap there  And he's got  A good  Fifteen  Seventeen years on us  Easy  Yeah  He's crazy  He's insane  And he wrote me  He goes  I'm in Disney world hell  But I want to thank you  Anthony  Jim Norton  And your fine listeners  You called a pest  For putting me over the top  Versus you guys  Oh right right  He said that jokingly  But he goes  He goes  If you guys gave a shit  About this contest 
[02:16:00]  You would have murdered me  But he said  I'm glad he realizes that  Yeah he goes  Thanks for the props  He goes  Trust me  I really need a little bump  And well now  I did send him a bunch of propellers  So I'm glad he's  He got them  Propellers  Why would I  What the fuck did I do  Why would you  He said thanks for the props  I got it  Oh  I got it  When I heard you do that to Voss  On the replay  Yeah  I laughed  And now I'm victim of it  So now it's  Wee's in the finals 
[02:16:30]  I got it  It's Wee's in the finals  So the pest  Just you know  Just finished this off nicely  And honestly  I really appreciate the people  That for once  Listened to me  That was kind of nice  I really appreciate that  So I think  Yeah  I think we have  A love relationship now  Oh that's cute  I'm going to take  The hate relationship part  Out of the love hate relationship  And I think  Good luck with that  I think it's a love relationship  With the fans now  Good luck with that  Love relationship  So Wee's is 50 flurf 
[02:17:00]  Actually  50 flurf  Actually Michelle  From Morgan, New Jersey  He's 60 flurf  With a 5 and 8 year old  He doesn't like Disney  Huh  Who would  I enjoy going to  Oh Disney  I forgot that  Yeah but do you  Walk around the Magic Kingdom  And all that  I've been known to  Yes  You like the Magic Kingdom  Yes I go to the Magic Kingdom  I thought you liked it down there  Because you got the Pleasure Island  You got the nice hotels  You got the nice room service  Everything is warm 
[02:17:30]  And new  And happy  I like going to Epcot  Epcot's alright  Which has the  Different lands  You could travel the world  Within an hour or two  A couple hours  You've drank at every place  In the world  And then they also have  Rides there  And very informative  Attractions on  The sea  And the land  And science  Which I like  And then the Magic Kingdom  Is little rides  That are very nostalgic 
[02:18:00]  They kind of bring you back  To a more innocent time  In your life  So they're kind of fun  You don't have to be a kid  To laugh  And have a good time  On the Peter Pan ride  Let's say  Is a great opportunity  To touch small children  In line  When you're waiting  On some of these rides  I fucking hated Disney  Did you?  I will bring my kids there  Because you gotta  You know  You just gotta  But I hated it  I went for  One of my big birthdays 
[02:18:30]  Did you?  With my brother Elmo  And we walked around  We actually had a good time  But I mean  Everything was so like  Outdated  And just stupid  I kind of like that  It smells like  Cinnamon  And cotton candy  Oh god  Then I try to make fun  Of Wee's  Because we're going  Back and forth  A little text messaging  During the walkover  You know  We do our thing  Between the two shows  That's why  That's why we don't  Broadcast live  Because we want 
[02:19:00]  To do some things  We need to do things  And I go  Dude you better not  Be wearing a Mickey Mouse  Logo anywhere on your body  Because we talked about this  Maybe we could go down  This road a little bit today  Like you go  You go to these tourist traps  And you start buying the myth  That it's cool to be wearing  A Mickey Mouse shirt  Well it is if you're at Disney  And as soon as you go home  It's not cool  By any means  For a child  It's fine  Yeah  But as an adult  So  Probably the worst thing 
[02:19:30]  You could do  Is if you get married  And then you go down  To Disney  Is to wear the top hat  With the ears  And the bridal veil  With the Minnie Mouse ears on them  Right  That's probably the silliest  Oh Travis I'm sorry  Yeah  That's right  He did that  Yeah which is just awful  Jimmy just went oh  Of course  Well but  You know what  But now you gotta understand  Because  Obviously if you're Travis 
[02:20:00]  You gotta get married  In Disneyland  Disney World  Whatever  I'd never get the two straight  You know when you don't have  A mommy in the picture  You know  You gotta get some happiness  Back in your life  So why not  Go to the happiest place on earth  Right  Travis and no mommy  Oh she's alive  And doing very well  Without Travis  Yeah  Doesn't want anything  To do with him  Anyway  She had Mickey Mouse ears  It'd be fucking  Her knees would be  Pinned by them  Fucking someone  From the West Bank  Giving her a fucking  Deep dicking 
[02:20:30]  With fucking  Diamonds in one hand  And a fucking  Sub machine gun  Over his other shoulder  Giving her a fucking  Great cock pounding  Oh shit  So I go  Weez you better not  Be wearing a Mickey Mouse  Logo on your body  So he writes me back  He goes  No Mickey shirts  Ready for this  I wish we could have  The voting back  No Mickey shirts  Got me  A nice grumpy  Oh he's wearing  A shirt with grumpy  On it  And then he writes  Doreen who's 
[02:21:00]  Much much younger  Much much  Better looking than Weez  Has been letting him  This is what he says  Her name  Because I don't know  If he wants that  Over the air  Been letting me drive  To Hard Rock Casino  In Tampa every day  For some poker  Wow okay  How cool is that  Like he's down there  With two little kids  And his wife's going  Yeah you could go  Drive to Tampa  To play some of your poker  Because he's a big  Hold'em guy  Yeah  Loves his poker  And that's about it  Oh then he's fine  Do your show  You guys rule 
[02:21:30]  So  Then he's fine  Vote for Brother Weez  At RochesterInsider.com  I believe  Alright  I gotta go guys  My thing's here  I should be back  Before the end of the show  I think I'm done by 10-30  Oh we can't wait Jimmy  Really  It's not airing today  It airs tomorrow  Like on ABC News  It's the third hour  It's not the real  You best come back here  Is it on ABC  I don't know  ABC News  Different channel I think  It's the third hour they do  ABC  Good Morning America  Wouldn't just let me walk on  No  It doesn't work that way  Why Jimmy  Because she had fucking  The president of Syria  And the president of Iran  And everyone but the Pope 
[02:22:00]  She can't get the Pope  You fit right in there though  A little Jimmy Norton  No I know that  But they don't see it that way  I have a better chin  Than the fucking president of Syria  Jesus Christ  On the side  You'd think I'm him  I'm kind of bummed  You're gonna be stepping out  Because we got Morgan Spurlock  Coming in  I like Morgan a lot  I saw his movie  It was pretty damn good  I have not seen it  I got some very good observations  About what's going on over there  And his point about  By the way  Spurlock is brilliant  He made a point  About how come  When you see people smoking  You can say something  That's acceptable  But if they're fat  You can't 
[02:22:30]  Right  And he's just great  I wish I had thought of that  I like the guy  What's the name of the movie  In Search of  Two Hunters  Where's Osama Bin Laden  Where in the world  Is Osama Bin Laden  Oh yeah  Kind of like  Where in the world is Waldo  Or climate Santiago  Yeah  Oh duh  Or that  Or the right answer  That game came  I'll see you guys  In a little while  I should be back  All right  All righty  Noah's interesting though  Jimmy as you're leaving  Like they have  Souvenir shops  Over there  Just like they have  Over here  Really  And they have guys  Wearing jihad t-shirts 
[02:23:00]  Well it's just like here  You know  That's what I'm thinking  But I thought  That was pretty interesting  That they're kind of  Marketing the whole  Jihad  Jihad thing  Why not  The other thing  He talked to a lot  Of regular folk  In all these countries  Over there  He went to a lot  Of different countries  Egypt  Afghanistan  Saudi Arabia  And a few others  Thrown in there  Oh he was in  Jerusalem  Or whatever  Israel  Israel  And all that  Yeah  And so many people  He talked to  As he went into 
[02:23:30]  Their homes and stuff  They were watching  Wrestling  Really  Vince McMahon  Wrestling  Oh WWE  Not Roman Greco  I thought it would be  Some kind of  Bastardized version  Of their own  Call to prayer  Wrestling or something  And a lot of them  Really believe  That wrestling  Is real  Is real  Stop it  I swear to god  So you're saying  They're as stupid  As Sam  Yes  When it comes to wrestling  And then Morgan's like  You do know this is fake  And then one guy  Actually in the movie  In the movie goes 
[02:24:00]  Well yeah  They're all fake  Unless they're  The matches are fake  Unless they're wrestling  For a title  And then it's real  Title is real  Right  Really  Dummy  And then the other thing  Which I think you  Might find interesting  Anthony  I don't know  Hold on two seconds  Dick Cheney yucks it up  At Correspondents Dinner  And I'm seeing him  Doing that on MSNBC  You know what's weird  About Dick Cheney  I was thinking  Just yesterday  That we haven't seen him  In a really really long time  And I had this thought  In my head that he's dead  But obviously he's not 
[02:24:30]  If this just went down  I want to hear how  He yucked it up  With Mo  What's that guy's  Mo Rocca  God enough of him  I like Mo Rocca  I liked him a lot  On the Daily Show  But enough  Because now he's trying  To be that character  He did so well  For Jon Stewart  Yeah  Where he goes  One trick pony  Whatever  Anyway so  The thing I found  Interesting about the movie  That Morgan's going to discuss  Hopefully in a few minutes here  I think Roland went to get him  That most of these people 
[02:25:00]  Don't hate Americans  And this is why  This is what I want to get into  With him  They hate the American government  They're pretty much  Separating the two  Really?  Yeah  Because like I hate  Not the  Iraqis  But not the terrorists  Not the  Hardcore guys  But we're talking about  Regular citizens  Definitely hate the American government  But don't hate the American people  Yeah  And a lot of these people  Kind of feel sorry  For the fact that we have  President Bush 
[02:25:30]  And what he's doing  You're talking about  The regular Abu's  Huh?  The regular Abu's  The regular one  Yeah  They don't hate us  I don't really buy that  Well we'll get into it with him  Because I thought that was  Very very interesting  And the other thing is  He's a brave motherfucker  Is he?  He was getting slapped around  By Hasidic Jews  We got to get into that  A little bit  Because he was trying  To ask them questions  And it was hilarious  Because a scene in the movie  He's trying to ask  These Hasidic Jews  Where's Osama 
[02:26:00]  And what do you think of this  What do you think of Americans  And the Hasidic Jews over there  Did not want to talk to him  And he actually says  Watch this  They're starting to get the word out  That I'm asking questions  And watch how they just start gathering  And it started with just a handful  Of Hasidic Jews  Next thing you know  It was like  I don't know  A hundred of them  And one older Hasidic Jew  Was getting really aggressive  With Morgan Spurlock  Getting in his face  And pushing his face  And slapping him and stuff  Really?  And then the police  Had to get involved  To get him out of there  Boy they don't seem like 
[02:26:30]  The violent type  Well but they  And why were they all pissed off?  I think I was like  Reading like email  On my Blackberry  So I don't know  I missed the key  The key part of the movie  The key part of  And it didn't feel like  Rewinding  Of that story too  Well we had a lot of things  To watch for today's show  I'm like I gotta watch this  I gotta watch the  Will and Defoe movie  I don't have time to rewind  Because I missed a part of the movie  So we'll have to ask him that  I did like school  We had homework last night  And I didn't do it 
[02:27:00]  I know  I never did my homework  In school  And I don't do it at work  But your Angry Vince  Was terrific  Thank you sir  Maybe we gotta make it  So it doesn't feel like  Homework to you  And then you'll  Watch some of this stuff  Uh  No  Really?  No  No  I do watch some movies  Like that are really good  And I can get an early copy  But some movies  I'm  I don't know  They're not on my  Top I gotta see them  Right now list  I know I should watch  I mean it's probably 
[02:27:30]  A good movie  I'm sure  That one is  Which one?  Sounds interesting  Which one?  Uh  The Osama Bin Laden one  Yeah that was a good movie  Yeah  Uh oh  What?  You were asking me  About a movie  That was really good  About the other one  Will and Defoe's  Let's say hi to  Wet Chicken  Wet Chicken  You're on the  Opie and Anthony show  What's up  B-b-b-boys  Hello Wet Chicken  Hey I'm gonna be in  Tampa a little later  Any chance of getting  Hooked up with  The great  Brother Weave  Dude he'll  Oh  You tell him  You're an Opie and Anthony

[02:52:00]  Fucking Roland can bite back  It doesn't look like he can  But he has  He might have the best bite back  Oh yeah  On the whole staff  Cause you're not expecting it  Not at all  I know  And Roland  We love each other too  I can't believe you said that to me  Do you like Tony?  Oh I can hear you here  No  He's lying  He loves me  You don't like Tony?  I do  Kinda?  Yeah at times  Doses  Doses  Alright what's the name of your station? 
[02:52:30]  I don't know  I never did this  Um  W-N-B-C  I don't know  That's all  Does anyone have a suggestion  For Roland's station?  It was easy up to this point  Might get punched  Don't say anything  No  Obviously he could work  At E-Rock station  But you know  I'm gonna use that twice  Well  How about  W-D-U-L  I don't know  W. Unsure.  I don't know. 
[02:53:00]  Huh?  W.  W. Nervous.  W. H. A. T.  What?  What?  Nothing good coming in.  Even Dickie Punchcock doesn't have a good one.  Dickie Punchcock doesn't have a good one?  I find that hard to believe.  WCOC, but eh.  W. L. S. P.  As in Lisp.  I don't know. 
[02:53:30]  Maybe just W.  How about we do that?  W. W. Nervous.  Let's try that, alright?  Alright, here's Roland.  What do you want to talk up?  I don't know.  You can pick your own song.  You like Bruce, don't you?  Yeah.  Love the Bruce.  You've got Glory Days ready if you want that, Roland.  Glory Days works?  Yeah.  Alright, and what's your radio name?  Um.  I don't know.  What was your nickname as a kid?  That's a good place to start. 
[02:54:00]  My dad called me Chongo Monkey.  What?  I called you what?  Yeah, because I was a hairy kid.  So my dad goes, Chongo, come here.  Chongo?  Chongo.  What the fuck is Chongo?  Chongo is like a monkey in Spanish.  Is that how you say monkey in Spanish?  I think so.  That's what he called me unless it was something else.  Six, look that up, see what it means.  Six.  It means something really bad.  Mars just said it means crybaby.  Does it really?  Does it?  Oh, Mars saying yes.  Yeah, you crybaby.  Alright, Chongo is your radio name. 
[02:54:30]  Chongo when I was a kid.  The radio station is WWE.  Alright.  Just kind of.  Oh, yeah.  Alright, ready?  Alright.  You know what you're going to talk about?  I don't know.  I'll try to think of something.  Well, make believe Morgan Spurlock's coming up on your show maybe, because then it promotes  his appearance that's happening soon.  Plus the fact that we get something done here.  Alright.  Alright?  Alright.  There's a new movie opening Friday.  Why?  Here we go.  Rolling.  Hey, this is Chongo.  You're listening to W.A. 
[02:55:00]  The Pope's in town.  Pick up your Pope hat.  And listen to Bruce on the way to the movies by watching Morgan Spurlock.  Here's Glory Days.  Hey, it's a pose.  I would listen to that every day, by the way.  Oh, cool, man.  Get your Pope hat.  Get your Pope hat.  It's the Pope.  I, uh...  Why do they put these polished jocks on that hit the post and just naturally talk when they  can have someone like Roland on them? 
[02:55:30]  I've been asked that question for years.  Just throw a guy on like Roland.  Don't even have meetings with the guy.  Nothing.  Just go, you have to show up at noon.  You have to be there till three.  Here's the records you play.  You have to get these records in and what you do in between the records, I don't give  a shit.  And people would listen every fucking day.  The Pope is in town and...  Instead, you get the jocks.  They're called liner jocks and they read these dumb little index cards that have this info  on that no one gives a shit for the most part.  And you get no personality. 
[02:56:00]  We should develop.  No, we should do.  We should develop somehow on 202 like a mini radio station where these guys actually have  shifts.  Wow.  And they do music and they can do whatever the fuck they want in between.  And I don't even want them working hard.  Just like their name, their fake station, and just a quick little dump thing before some  cool music.  Good idea.  What's that?  Saturday programming?  Sunday?  Yeah.  Sunday morning?  Actually, I think this is...  Religious programming.  This would be good programming Monday through Friday from, I'm thinking, noon to three. 
[02:56:30]  Mmm.  Be a perfect time song for something like this.  You know?  What happened?  Huh?  Someone in there?  What?  Alright, getting back to Tony and Pat Duffy.  So, uh...  So, Tony says that you're no big deal because you just do shit bits.  Which is bullshit.  And I think it's bullshit for you to say that I only put shit on my face because I do a ridiculous  amount of stuff around here.  Well, I never...  Those weren't the words I said.  You take them a little out of context.  But, um... 
[02:57:00]  Listen, you're trying to get hired.  I'm trying to get hired.  Right.  We're kind of pals.  Right.  But I assume you wouldn't, uh, you know, hesitate two seconds and jump over my dead corpse to  get the job.  In a second.  So, why should I give a shit about your feelings?  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  I understand.  So, with that being said, uh, the shit comment was, what it is.  You know, I'm doing my thing.  They don't know my name.  They know your name.  Behind the scenes, you could ask all the guys.  All the guys behind the scene. 
[02:57:30]  They know I'm always coming up and writing and creating.  So...  And if you ask them, right now, who they would rather have working with them, I guarantee  you, however many we have, how many do we have?  Ten people?  Eight, nine out of ten would save me.  But, these guys know you.  That's bullshit.  Just because you're in here.  Well, we could do it.  You're here one to two days, if we're lucky, a week.  I've been here four days a week for 15 months.  Oh.  Busting my ass every single day that I'm here. 
[02:58:00]  Slow down, Chief.  I'm here two days a week.  And in the first year, before you were even here, I was here three days a week.  So, you've just caught up to my first year of working here in your, whatever, three days  a week.  I still have a whole full year.  Four.  Four.  Three days.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, plus every single Saturday Night Virus for the past 15 months.  Well, I come on Saturday...  Right on the board.  I'm on the most important Saturday Night Virus show, the Than and Sam show.  Wow.  Except for the Than and Sam show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The man's got taste.  I got to say about it. 
[02:58:30]  What have you done for the Than and Sam show, though?  I know what Pat Duffy has done for this small radio show called Opie and Anthony, but what  has Tony done for this great show called Than and Sam?  Well, we have sort of a love-hate relationship, I guess, on that show.  I'm a little bit of a punching bag, but at the same time, I get my time in.  What would be the big highlight of what you've done on the Than and Sam show?  We've done like 14 terrific shows so far.  My highlight for Pat Duffy is obviously receiving end of the baby birthday.  Yeah, that was huge.  Let's start it all. 
[02:59:00]  Maybe the staple gun to the forehead.  I don't know.  Maybe brushing his teeth with dog shit or what else?  The homeless mustache thing was good.  Well, see, that's the thing.  Like, you know, Duffy said earlier he doesn't want to have his own radio show.  I want to have my own radio show one day, and I don't want to be known as the shit and  body fluid guy.  You know, I'm sorry.  It's fine if you want to do production.  I'm just not going to do those kinds of things because I don't want to be put into that category.  That's fine if you want to do what you want to do. 
[02:59:30]  I just don't think people are going to take you seriously if you go to get a job on radio.  They're like, oh, that's the guy who rubbed homeless shit on his face.  Well, I'll have you know that I applied for a job a couple months ago.  I was trying to figure out what I was going to do if I was going to continue this internship.  God, I hope you get it.  No, listen to me.  I applied for the job, and I came back that I was overqualified due to what I've done here.  What?  Did you tell them about all your stunts?  Yeah.  All they had to do.  What did you apply for?  Fucking fear factor?  No. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, man.  I applied at a rock station in Connecticut, and I was told that I was overqualified and  I can't come from number one market to shitty small Connecticut market based on the shit  that I've done.  All they had to do was go to the website and look up my name.  What job was it for?  It was actually for the morning show producer.  Why would they want someone like you for that?  What radio station?  99 PLR.  PLR?  PLR?  No, I saw the ad and I applied. 
[03:00:30]  PLR is a pretty impressive station for people coming up in the business.  Dude, that sounds like a way to blow you off.  Yeah.  That sounds like we don't want you.  Once you want PLR back in the day, Ant?  I used to guest on...  What the fuck was the show?  Chaz?  Chaz, right.  Yeah, PLR is a pretty big station for up-and-comers especially.  Well, they didn't seem interested in me, so...  Aw.  So they told you a bullshit story about being overqualified.  Oh, you're way too overqualified, Mr. Shit-on-Face guy. 
[03:01:00]  No, I didn't even...  Wow.  I didn't mention one thing about anything that I've done like that.  All I sent him was my production examples and my resume, and he told me that it was too good.  Let me just Google Pat Duffy and see what happens.  It comes up with a skateboarder.  Oh, nice.  Does a skateboarder name Pat Duffy?  Yeah.  That sucks.  What if we throw in...  He shreds that guy.  Yeah.  Tony, anything else?  No, I mean, well, in terms of that comment, like, how would they find your production 
[03:01:30]  skills and your producing skills when they go to the website?  Well, no, he...  It's a baby bird video.  Right.  Understood.  But no, he told me that he went to the site, and all he had to do was look and type in my  name or whatever.  No, because the baby bird video was on the front page for a really long time, and he saw  that shit, and then we got into talking about that with the guy from PLR.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard turd from Man Cow Show.  It's the same shit.  Ooh.  Wow.  That was nice.  That's bad, because turd faked his shit. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  Pat Duffy actually does it.  He does his shit.  Set that record straight, my friend.  That's why we love that guy.  I don't know.  What'd you do today, Duffy?  All right.  I did a bunch...  Like, every day, I do a bunch of work for E-Rock.  Oh, God.  What?  Lunch orders?  Yeah.  I've been a nightmare.  Getting the garlic, the butter, the sauce.  You gotta keep all the menus in order.  But that's what I did specifically today.  I'm just wondering.  In food groups. 
[03:02:30]  What did you do, sir?  You got the Italian menus, the Greek menus, the Chinese...  All right, enough about the menus.  I was just working...  That's a fatso.  Jesus.  I was working on some ideas.  And I actually...  What's your idea you're working on today, Tony?  Well, today I was doing another...  I was thinking of...  I wrote another Deuce Shield Theater, but I also did some other production.  Get back into the well.  Oh, he's pulling out a bit!  Wow.  That's embarrassing.  All right.  That's embarrassing.  Right in front of Pat's face.  It's not an original bit, but it's a good take on an old bit, and you're going to love  this guy.  It's a guy named Mike gets tasered. 
[03:03:00]  What's this?  And then it says Mike ruled.  Why wouldn't you save this for the Than and Sam show?  Now these guys are giving me a look like...  What the fuck?  I got plenty more for those boys.  I'm bringing my first online date on the next Than and Sam show.  Tune in.  Oh, wow.  Wait, what are you doing?  I just started online dating.  I got a couple hits.  I'm going to bring my first online date.  I went on.  When is that?  Than and Sam.  I think it's the 26th.  Oh.  9 to 12th.  Oh.  Yeah.  So you're actually...  The first time you get an online date, it's like a blind date, right?  Three months have gone by already.  And you're bringing her on the show? 
[03:03:30]  It's a new season.  Well, no.  I'm not going to have her on the show.  I'm going to bring her into the studio.  Bring her into the studio.  They'll probably end up trying to talk to her.  I don't know if it's...  I would guess.  No, that sounds boring.  We wouldn't want to talk to your date.  And the thing is that I'm going to have to ride home with her on the train after you  guys destroy her, which is not going to be fun.  That'll be good.  I'm afraid.  I would tune in for that.  That's kind of good.  I like the sound of that.  All right.  You brought an audio.  You had it hidden the whole time.  And you take it out of your pocket right in front of poor Pat Duffy here.  It just kind of slipped my mind a little bit. 
[03:04:00]  Because, you know, I usually have all kinds of production.  I didn't even think about it.  I just pulled it out.  What he's saying, Pat, if you didn't understand, he has bits just in every pocket.  I'm always prepared with a stunt.  He's got a sweatshirt.  He's got bits all over the place.  And you just decide, you know what?  Here, guys.  I'll be honest with you, Pat.  You're not always prepared with a stunt.  You'll do anything that we bring up or other people bring up.  But I don't think you actually say, hey, I'll do this.  There's a thousand thumbtacks in my backpack right now that I've had for months and months. 
[03:04:30]  And what are you going to do with that?  I could do anything.  I could shove my face in it.  I don't give a shit.  It's just I'm prepared.  I'm prepared.  Well, if you're prepared, let's go.  I mean, what I see as far as prepared.  Perfect moment.  What, what, what?  We just both of us stared at each other and just kind of raised our shoulders up and raised our eyebrows.  I went, okay.  Like so?  Why not?  I think you're making it up on the spot.  What I see here is a bit from Tony.  He handed it over to me. 
[03:05:00]  Great taser audio.  So you better get your thumbtacks.  It's just, you know, it's just something off the top of my head, but just because I don't  have production, you know, available at any given time.  He's basically calling you out though.  So like, and you said you, you know, you, and makes a good point.  You'll do whatever we say, which is an amazing thing for this radio show.  But like, what does Pat Duffy have for the radio show on his own without any prodding?  We're seeing here, we're seeing action and words.  That's it.  It's kind of action.  He pulls out a bit. 
[03:05:30]  Words.  You're talking about things.  Right.  I, um, I'm going both ways here.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  Really?  You got an announcement to make?  No.  Bisexual.  Can't you say it for the Than and Sam show?  You like making your big announcements on every other radio show except yours.  Jesus Christ.  The fuck?  We'll make time if you want to ask.  He's admitting what?  On whose show?  What?  We need to go longer.  All right.  Well, here's Tony's bit that he brought in for everybody today. 
[03:06:00]  It's called, uh, a guy named Mike gets tasered.  Why is this important?  Mike rules.  Mike rules.  You did write that here.  So let's see.  I'll tell you what.  Right now, you are under arrest for failing to stop when signaled by the police.  Relax your hands.  Relax your hands.  Relax your hands.  Relax.  This can go good or bad.  I don't want it to go bad.  I don't care what happens.  You hear that dog in there?  Bring that dog out.  I'll box that right now.  I want you to calm down, bud.  What's your first name?  Mike.  Mike?  My name's Rob. 
[03:06:30]  What's up?  Mike, we're going to put your hands behind your back.  Do you understand?  I don't want to fight you.  You don't want to fight me.  Relax your arms.  Todd?  Get the little thing out of your pocket.  Relax.  Mike?  Stop it.  Throw him in here in a second.  You are under arrest.  Do you understand?  For what?  For failing to stop when signaled by the police.  Stop.  Index.  Do it.  Do it.  Oh. 
[03:07:00]  Okay, okay, okay.  Get on your back.  On your back.  On your stomach.  Get on your stomach.  Give it to him again.  No, no, no.  Put your arms out.  Oh, Mike.  Put your arms out.  Okay, okay.  You got to get it again, Mike.  Okay, again.  I'm sorry, man.  Don't fight, Mike.  I won't.  Just calm down, man, okay?  I'm done, man.  All right.  Good to go.  Good to go.  What's wrong here, Mike?  I'm just mad at the world, man.  Okay.  I can't do anything right.  I'm going to have you hold today. 
[03:07:30]  Tonight you did it, okay?  That's Mike.  Mike wants to box the dog.  That's Mike, huh?  Yeah, sounds a bit familiar.  Yeah, sounds like it's been played before.  Yeah.  A bit.  A few times on our show.  The only defense I have to that was, that's why it was in my pocket, because it hasn't been  played past any employee.  So I just brought it out, because I was busy doing production.  You know, I didn't have time to bring it back.  He doesn't have that confidence in his voice as he did when he pulled that thing out and 
[03:08:00]  whipped it across the console.  But it is how he pulled it out, couched away.  There you go.  There you go.  You take that, would you?  One thing too far, I guess.  Mike does rule, though.  Yeah, he does rule.  We have some audio of Pat Duffy's Radio Empire.  The beginning of the Pat Duffy Radio Empire.  Radio Empire?  Yeah.  He's starting off with an empire?  No, that was a joke that lasted like five seconds.  And wait, it's Pat Duffy's CSB radio demo?  This was our final project for CSB.  You had to do this, you had to do a ten minute radio show in front of the whole class, and 
[03:08:30]  you had to do everything right to pass the class.  Wait, why'd you have to do it in front of the class?  You don't do radio in front of like that many phones.  I felt the same way.  So that's kind of stupid.  So you broadcast in front of the class?  Yeah, you have to do the whole thing in front of the class.  The beauty of radio is you don't see the people you're fucking dummies, man.  Exactly.  Unless you're on this show.  And you can hear it, I sound very nervous out there.  You think you would do half this shit if you had to see the people?  You're listening to V93.7 WCSV, the only station with enough balls to bring you the 
[03:09:00]  very best in today's metal.  The Power Hour with Pat D, afternoons, 3 to 7 p.m.  The human race makes me want to vomit.  Metalocalypse, weeknights, 7 to 11 p.m. with DJ B-Zag.  All I want to do in life is drink beer, play music, and sleep with chicks.  V93.7 WCSV.  Everything that rocks and nothing that sucks.  In my own defense.  In my own defense.  Oh, we didn't even say anything. 
[03:09:30]  I know.  Wow.  We didn't say a word.  Oh my god.  In my defense.  Before anything is said.  Right.  I only made that promo for the assignment.  I had to make a CSB promo about the station.  And I ripped off a free FM promo.  Let me say something here.  You seem to be using your celebrity status with the puke noise.  That, well, that was, this was made in, uh, like, this was probably two weeks after I 
[03:10:00]  did that.  Yeah.  In 2006.  Seriously?  Two weeks after the puke thing.  Yeah.  So, you, you kind of used it.  It was still rotting high from that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  I also love when people, uh, and I did it too, believe me, uh, when, when you're not  in radio and you have to sort of make your own drops of what you, you know, like when  we're getting production for this show, you guys say lots of funny stuff.  We just pulled out of the show.  Thank you, sir.  But, uh, you know, when you're making your own production, you have to be like, I'm 
[03:10:30]  a shocking guy.  Okay.  Isolate that.  I'm going to throw that in my, uh, I had to make my own drops and they had to act as  if you've had this radio show for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they're just pulling, you're just pulling sound from this show that never existed.  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of jocks that say, uh, we're, uh, not scared to play, uh, such  and such.  Yeah.  I don't think people are actually scared to play a particular.  I would say if there was, um, I would say if there was, um, I would say  say if there was, um, one disc in all of the, uh, CDs that was made out of like unstable 
[03:11:00]  dynamite, then I'd be like, Hey, I'm not scared to play any of these songs.  I'll even try some Tom Petty.  Then it's cool because you never know you could blow up and we, and we say that cause  we're not, we're not talking down to you guys.  Cause we've been there like, and I made our, made our names for ourselves working for a  station that, that their big slogan was the only station that really rocks, which is like,  what the fuck does that mean?  What do you mean? 
[03:11:30]  Like all these other stations playing the same crap don't rock?  They, no, no, they rock, they're fake rocking, they're fake rocking, but this really rocks.  And I worked for three homes of rock and roll.  So I understand the bad slogan.  Rock and roll moves a lot.  They sure do, which is confusing.  I mean, how, how is WNW the home of rock and roll?  But there was like, what?  Q104 was rocking pretty good too, but they're not the home of rock and roll.  What are they then?  Who are they then? 
[03:12:00]  Co-op.  I have no idea.  Or Pat Duffy.  Congregation, please be seated.  You're listening to the Power Hour with your host, Pat D, bringing you everything that rocks  and nothing that sucks.  Pat Duffy rules.  From the station, it's not afraid to bring you the best in today's life.  Celebrity endorsement.  3.7 WCSV.  That Pat Duffy is a sick fuck.  He's a Cassius Duffy.  Like a man.  Like a man.  No, like Pat Duffy.  But enough of this clever. 
[03:12:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh my God.  You fucking rip off hack.  Yeah.  You can be sued for that.  Oh my God.  I'll fully admit it.  I'll fully admit that I ripped everything off on it.  I fully admit it.  Oh my God.  You're using our voices as endorsements.  Right.  So that the people would go like, oh, that's Hopi and Anthony endorsing this Pat Duffy guy.  Exactly.  Endorsing this fake radio show.  Yeah.  This fake fucking show.  And then enough of this palaver. 
[03:13:00]  Well, I...  We ought to use that in the intro.  It's really good.  Right before we go on the air.  Mm-hmm.  You guys should take that from me.  Wow.  You rip off.  I know.  I mean, I'll fully admit it, though.  It was...  You didn't figure you'd work on this, maybe, and come up with some original stuff?  Oh, I worked on it.  No, you took shit from this show.  Yeah, but...  I mean, I don't see a problem.  I can see a problem with taking the palaver thing at the end, but I don't think it's a  big deal taking those drops.  Why?  It's from this show. 
[03:13:30]  That's a very obscure drop.  That's not from...  That's not like a South Park drop or Family Guy.  That's...  You got...  That's really obscure.  And it's not clips from, like, your imaginary show.  Right.  Like, I could grab clips from other shows all over the country and pop them together  and make it sound like an intro to my show.  Well...  I would have to do that, because I have a show.  Well, yeah.  The next clip...  This is handy.  The next clip...  Did Sam write this out?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Sam's writing, obviously. 
[03:14:00]  It says, Pat D, as opposed to Pat Duffy, who was talked about in the intro, starts his  show with an antidote.  Oh, yeah.  This is awful.  Oh, man.  What's going on out there, everybody?  This is the Power Hour.  My name is Pat D, hanging out here with you for the next couple...  Why is it the Power Hour?  Because we had to come up with a name, we had to come up with a concept for the show, and  that was all I could think of at the time.  PLO really fucking missed out.  Yeah.  This is really turning around on me quick.  Oh, man.  What's going on out there, everybody? 
[03:14:30]  This is the Power Hour.  My name is Pat D, hanging out here with you for the next couple hours on B93.7 WCSB, as  you all know by this point.  Opened up the show today with Cannibal Corpse, a song called Hammer Smashed Face, and it's  going out for this lady that cut me off in traffic today on the way here down on Route  17, and I'll tell you what, nothing in this world would give me better pleasure than to  smash that woman's face with a claw hammer.  That didn't actually happen.  By the way, that reminds me of a station that makes me read this.  The opinions expressed herein are solely of the host of this program, and not of B93.7 
[03:15:00]  WCSB FM, and station management does not endorse or condone said opinion.  That being said, let's start the medal here.  This is Necrophagist with Stillborn on B93.7 WCSB.  What?  Hold on.  Wait, I nodded off.  What?  What?  He was doing...  Actually, I was very nervous because I was in front of the whole class.  It must have been very nerve-wracking.  Especially now.  You should do, like, Claw Hammer Tuesday or something.  I like that. 
[03:15:30]  You're just deciding you're going to beat a woman over the head.  Yeah, and that didn't happen.  I just thought that would be a cool story.  I didn't think it would.  A story that exciting, you could not make up.  It could not possibly happen.  You'd have to make it up.  It was a lot more detailed in my notes, but once I went to air, I was too nervous to remember  all the details.  It was very believable that you really wanted to take this Claw Hammer to this broad.  Yeah.  I was right there with you.  I really felt how I felt.  Yeah.  It was good.  I'm awful. 
[03:16:00]  You're not awful.  You're not awful.  You're going to use that now?  Slow down, O.  Hey, it's Pat D.  Hey, you're not awful.  I will.  And I only had one static effect.  Static noise.  That was our entire library.  One effect.  It's not awful.  We're just using you to show you how ridiculous some of these radio things are.  Well, I got to be on it.  All right, here's the next one.  Pat D. comes back with more rock and talks about how to contact the show.  That was Necrophages with Stillborn, and we're back with the Power Hour. 
[03:16:30]  Once again, my name is Pat D.  Hanging out here with you, B93.7 WCSB.  Now, there's a couple ways to contact the show.  You can go online at WCSB.com, which, of course, you can stream from anywhere in the world.  And feel free to send me an instant feedback.  Log on to the Power Hour page and let me know what you want to hear.  You can also send me an email, powerhour at gmail.com.  And if you're old-fashioned and stuck in the 90s, you can call me, 1-800-POWER-HOUR.  That's P-W-R-H-O-U-R.  Got a request in from Justin in Flagstaff, Arizona, of course, listening online. 
[03:17:00]  And he wants you to hear some cattle decapitation.  This is Chumified CSB.  It's a metal show.  When did the phones become old-fashioned, first of all?  Well, I just, you know.  I mean, if you would have said a fax machine or a fax.  Yeah.  Also, your delivery is more like you need to be on one of these mix stations.  Oh.  Because if you're, like, introing a song that's named Stillborn, you, you know.  Yeah, you gotta read up a little bit. 
[03:17:30]  You gotta be a little more.  You're right.  You should work for a station named after an animal, I'm thinking.  I don't know.  There's a few to choose from, right?  Yeah.  What are some of the biggies these days?  The hawk.  The cat.  The wolf.  Wolf is a good one.  Yeah.  I think there's a fox.  Definitely a fox.  Nah, he's a little better than a fox.  Yeah, tougher than a fox.  I had to work out one of the foxes.  Ugh.  103.3, the fox. 
[03:18:00]  Horrible orange logo.  That was Cattle Decapitation with Chumified.  I got an instant feedback here from...  Really?  An instant feedback?  Where'd you get that turned from?  I forgot me.  Really?  Oh, you're just a rip-off.  I know.  At this point, every station and every show has instant feedback, but I'm here to tell  you, that one definitely came from Ant-Nine.  Keep in mind that I didn't think that this was going to be played like this.  Oh, really?  So.  That's how true rip-off ours do it. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Keep in mind, I never thought my fraud would be exposed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I got an instant feedback here from Casey in Short Hills.  He says, hey man, I love the show and your twisted views on life.  You're sick.  Let me hear some goat whore.  Well, I guess some goat whore, man.  Wait a minute.  I love your twisted views on life.  I wrote that.  So instead of talking about more twisted views, he wants you to stop talking and go into a song. 
[03:19:00]  Exactly.  Like you, you should just do your twisted views.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  How we do?  How's goat whore?  Goat whore's pretty good.  Yeah?  I saw them live a couple years ago.  Makes me feel very old.  I don't know any of this shit.  Well, they're pretty obscure.  What's a good goat whore song?  Oh, honestly, I haven't listened to them in years.  I couldn't name one off the top of my head.  I just saw them as like a lineup show, like a compilation show.  But they're good.  The song I play is good.  What's the name of the song? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know off the top of my head.  I forget.  He says, hey man, I love the song.  I love the show and your twisted views on life.  You're sick.  Let me hear some goat whore.  Well, I can get you some goat whore, man.  That's no problem.  This is a song called Alchemy of the Black Sun Cult.  CSB.  What's your answer?  They have really long song titles.  That's the problem.  Alchemy of the Black Sun Cult?  Cult, yeah.  Wow.  This is like Spinal Tap-ish.  It really is.  Wow.  And I'm sure some of this stuff, they're cool and they got cool fans and stuff. 
[03:20:00]  Wow.  A little weird.  They don't know this.  Pat D gets a feedback from across the country, really.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Syndicated, right?  Oh, yeah.  Got another instant feedback here from Vinny from New Mexico.  Of course, listening online at WCSV.  He says, dude, I finally found the metal show I've been looking for.  I can't find this kind of brutal stuff anywhere else.  Keep up the good work.  Play something good for us out here in the desert.  And speaking of the desert, this band is called Deicide. 
[03:20:30]  They're from Arizona.  It's a segue.  Oh, God.  This was all required stuff for the project.  No, really?  It said you got to do a segue.  Yeah, you do.  You got to do this.  Everything that I'm doing is required.  How come everyone thinks you rule and no one calls up and thinks you suck?  Because I wrote all the programs.  And what instant feedback was that?  That was Justin.  Or not Justin.  The first one.  Yeah, from New Mexico.  And he says, you are the greatest ever, ever at everything.  Well, yeah.  You're a fucking Jesus. 
[03:21:00]  I love to say, speaking of the desert.  And then speaking of the desert.  We all do it.  Well, yeah.  There's no easy way.  I could use some dessert.  I remember.  That's a horrible segue.  I looked up desert.  This band is called Deicide.  They're from Arizona.  And you can pick up their new album.  It's called Stench of Redemption.  And Vinny, if you want Brutal, this is the most brutal album to pick up of 2006.  Deicide.  CSB.  So the desert, Arizona.  Because they're from Arizona.  There's deserts there.  And when I brought up that segue, I saw my instructors were like, oh, good. 
[03:21:30]  And they brought up that.  Oh, and they were looking like, oh, there's this segue.  Oh, no.  Mark off that as a check.  He did the seg.  Now, you guys went to broadcasting school.  At any time, did you think to yourselves, why aren't these fucking guys that are teaching  me doing this for a living instead of teaching me?  Yeah.  I think the guy, the main guy teaching me used to work for WWOR or something in like 94.  Oh.  Well, okay. 
[03:22:00]  That was his big claim to fame.  For a year?  Yeah.  He worked at some other stuff before.  I forget the guy's name.  He's old as hell, but.  And the guy who taught me did overnight board up at an AM station.  Fucking Earl is qualified to teach there.  When Ron finally wakes up and fires Earl, that's where Earl will end up, teaching bed radio.  Here's how you hang pictures.  Linger longer.  Hello. 
[03:22:30]  I'm a black girl.  Are you ready for your lesson?  Hello.  Hello.  But first, I'm going to get mad for no reason whatsoever.  Swanger, let me shake my fist.  I'm going to break all the equipment, and no one's going to know why.  Now, let's say you just want to do nothing.  Find a dark, secluded place.  Make it look like you're working.  Shuffle some papers around.  Show me your paper shuffling.  Show me your paper shuffling.  Hello.  I'm Earl.  I teach once a week, but I'm going to be at this college 24 hours a day. 
[03:23:00]  Make me believe this is a very tough job.  Yeah, I could do my whole job in one hour.  Boy, I hope this closed circuit TV in the classroom gets the Yankees game.  Fucking Earl.  I'm a bitch all day about how much I work.  I remember, like...  You know, I'm only supposed to be here an hour.  Every once in a while back in the day, we would stop by N.A.W. after an event or something,  for whatever reason, and Earl would be...  To drink.  Maybe drink, yeah.  We had a lot of beer in the office, and Earl would be there, and I'd go, 
[03:23:30]  Earl, what the fuck are you doing here?  It's 11 o'clock on a Tuesday night.  I'm going through the public access file.  I'm doing a public file, and I'm doing transmitter records.  I'm copying by hand like the monks, the transmitter records.  Where are we at?  Pat D. gets serious for a minute.  As required, we had to write our own public service announcements.  Wait, this is all in your 10-minute finale? 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I played a seven-minute cover song and read one commercial, and I was out.  You got lucky.  I had to do a whole bullshit 10-minute show, yeah.  These guys are out of touch.  Public service announcements?  Oh, yeah.  No one does these things anymore.  I take it real serious.  These things are recorded.  Radio guys don't have to do this shit anymore.  That was a band called AC.  I actually can't say the name of the band, but the A refers to the rear, the C refers to the front.  Anal cunt.  Figure it out on your own.  That was a song called Recycling is Gay. 
[03:24:30]  But on a serious note, folks, did you know that you hear...  You can't go from the band Anal Cunt with a song called Recycling is Gay into a serious  PSA.  But on a serious note, folks, you know, people do get anal warts.  How do you fucking...  I don't know what the PSA is about.  But how do you make that segue?  Is the PSA about being green and Mother Earth?  Well, it's about recycling.  Ah, recycling of...  Oh, no.  Oh, God. 
[03:25:00]  Yes.  That was a band called AC.  I actually can't say the name of the band, but the A refers to the rear, the C refers to  the front.  Figure it out on your own.  That was a song called Recycling is Gay.  But on a serious note, folks, did you know that each year, Americans use more than 67 million  tons of paper?  It's about 587 pounds per person.  I bet you also didn't know that paper products use up at least 35% of the world's annual commercial  wood harvest.  To top it all off, I bet you didn't know that each ton of recycled paper... 
[03:25:30]  Right.  Rub it in.  ...17 trees...  I don't know shit.  ...80 gallons of oil...  Hey, why'd you steal our boo?  Oh, carcass.  Hey, that's our boo again.  Go to EPA.gov.  Anyway, moving right along with the music, this is a band called Corpse F-ing, and I forgot  what the F stands for.  This is a song called The Shower Must Go On, CSB.  Corpse F-ing.  Corpse F-ing.  Corpse F-ing.  And admittedly...  And admittedly... 
[03:26:00]  After a serious PSA read?  Well, yeah.  That's the only way to do it.  Yeah, you know, make sure you recycle, because the paper and the trees...  Here's Corpse F-ing.  After some anal cunts.  Well, you know, but you're recycling the human form, which is good.  Yeah, you're using it.  Sure.  You're using.  Finally.  I'm going to leave you today with one more song that goes out to everybody out there listening  in their cars, at home, and of course online at WCSB.com.  Nowhere.  And everybody else around the world that decided to listen to this train wreck today, 
[03:26:30]  but this is a song by a band called Cannibal Corpse.  I know I opened the show today, but I'm going to go ahead and close with them, too.  This is a live cut called I Will Kill You, B93.7.  WCSB, this has been the Power Hour.  I'll see you next time.  I Will Kill You, B93.7.  Oh, no, you didn't do the see-ya.  Yeah, I still rip them off.  Yeah.  You didn't do the see-ya. 
[03:27:00]  I did.  I did.  You're just a big rip-off guy.  Then, yes.  90% of the shit that's on there isn't yours.  I know.  Don't say that.  What?  That 90% of his show was our show, because what did you get for this?  I got a B.  A B, right.  Yeah.  Using all our stuff, and you can only get a B.  That makes us feel good.  And I only got a B because of length.  I went like nine minutes, and it's supposed to be exactly ten.  Oh, wow.  You left early, like we do.  You got another jack coming in.  You got to, you know. 
[03:27:30]  Wait, they took a park.  They docked you because it wasn't ten minutes?  You didn't do bonus time.  They stink.  You're supposed to go to exactly ten.  What's the purpose there?  Because you're supposed to be able to, like, you know, stay within the time frames that you're  given, like if you have a real shift.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  That's the least of your worries when you do a radio show.  Yeah, it's sort of like Maverick with the hard deck, you know?  You can't go below it.  Even if you take out Viper or, you know, Jester, you have a problem.  Right.  You broke the rules. 
[03:28:00]  I'm not bringing mine in after that.  You're dangerous.  Bring yours in, Tony.  As I clench my jaws.  Any more bits, Tony?  You look at each other in a towel.  I don't know if I bring mine in after that.  It'd seem like a pussy if you guys heard, like, Italian restaurant.  You know?  I got fucking queer music on mine.  Oh, you got, like, Billy Joel and shit?  Yeah, because it was a long song.  You're given a format, right?  Were you given a format?  No, I just picked long songs.  Oh, fuck.  You picked faggy music?  Whatever was on my computer that was, like, six, seven minutes long. 
[03:28:30]  Hey, Hall and Oates.  Pat.  There it is.  Your kiss is on my list.  Speaking of lists.  You know, write down a list of things you can recycle.  See, that's an A right there.  Wow, wow.  Really?  Yeah, I kick ass.  Pat.  Yeah.  Because I know how you are.  It's really not that bad.  All right.  It's really not that bad.  Well, thank you.  But, like, if you're going to play that type of music, you got to get a little more of  an attitude.  I understood.  I know that.  But I was also in front of, like, 25 people.  You don't have a bad speaking voice and a delivery, so, like, you would do better probably 
[03:29:00]  on a regular rock station with that delivery.  But if you're doing that type of music, when you're an intro and ain't no cunt.  Right, yeah.  I mean, you got to, like, have a little passion and energy behind that.  I agree.  It's not like you were, like, you know, intro and, like, I'll say it again, like a Tom Petty  record or something.  Well, it was, like, towards the end, I had messed up a few times and I was really starting  to lose confidence because I felt like I was watching the people listening to the show  and they were getting bored.  Right.  So, then I was getting upset that they were getting bored and I was just trying to get  done with it.  We should do staff radio shows.  Yeah.  Like a block, though. 
[03:29:30]  Because I know these guys actually came up with a good idea where they, you know, played  their favorite songs and stuff and fucked around.  But this would be cool to have, like, 20-minute blocks.  Like, it's WFAT radio with E-Rock.  Boom.  He does, like, three or four segs, three or four songs.  Boom.  Right into the next show.  Yeah.  Right around the clock.  Good idea.  With Roland.  When can we do this?  Kenny.  Kenny.  When can we do this?  We could do it in the 11 o'clock hour for, like, a week.  Why don't we do it?  I'd say we start tomorrow, 6 a.m.  Very good. 
[03:30:00]  And do it till noon.  Uh, I'm thinking three in the afternoon.  Three?  Yeah.  All right.  That sounds good.  All right.  I like it.  So you guys friends are...  Oh, yeah.  Turn off my alarm.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's a problem.  No.  I just didn't...  I didn't like the...  You guys...  You only put shit on your face comment.  You do realize that...  You puke on your face.  You put a lot of stuff on your face.  I do all kinds of stuff.  I got a bit you could do today.  Uh, you know, I thought of it just now.  Oh.  Uh, when I was looking at some bits... 
[03:30:30]  Thinking of some bits before, I was...  Had a nice spitter in the back.  I filled out about half a cup of coffee of dip juice.  Maybe you'd want to take that down.  Delicious.  For your next stunt.  All right.  You want me to get it?  I don't...  You will get extremely sick.  Oh, I'll throw up everywhere.  You will turn white.  I'll throw up everywhere.  I used to try to do a little of that skull back in the day,  and I would fucking puke all the goddamn time.  Old time's sake.  And turn white.  There you go.  No, there's no way.  I'm not even going to try to act cool. 
[03:31:00]  I just don't...  I can't.  I'll turn white and just puke.  Yeah, that stuff...  You will not be able to even get it down.  No.  Oof.  Sounds like a dare, Harry.  Oh, God.  All right, well.  That's all you're good for, so we...  Oh, come on.  Well, I...  That's what Tony was saying.  I do so much shit here.  I gotta be honest.  So do I.  Neither one of you are going to get hired, but...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That hurt.  See, when he brought up the dip juice thing,  I think what he was saying is, 
[03:31:30]  that's all you do.  You're a one-trick pony.  And here I am.  So you should have just said,  go fuck yourself.  No.  But here I am jumping at it  for the opportunity to throw up.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I can't help it.  It's just my mind switches.  Yeah.  I'm like, all right, something disgusting.  John from Connecticut writes,  Hey, what do you think Casey Kasem  would sound like introducing anal cunt?  A band that I can't even say the name of.  A.C.  It's Anal Cunt on American Top Floor.  What's the song they did? 
[03:32:00]  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  Recycling is Gay.  Oh, yeah.  Recycling is Gay by Anal Cunt.  It's a song called Recycling is Gay  by the band Anal Cunt  on a long-distance dedication.  You should do a nice long-distance dedication.  Someone out there has to be requesting  Anal Cunt for a letter.  Recycling is for fags?  Recycling is Gay.  Oh, Gay.  A long-distance dedication.  This letter comes in from Kathy in Oklahoma.  She writes,  Dear Casey,  I like getting fucked in my anus 
[03:32:30]  and in my cunt.  Could you play Anal Cunt for my boyfriend?  I also go ass to mouth.  Well, we'll get that right on for you.  Here's Anal Cunt on American Top Floor.  Could you add the death dedication somehow in this?  Goddamn death dedication?  How am I supposed to go into an up-tempo number  by Anal Cunt  after a goddamn dog dying? 
[03:33:00]  Hi.  Hi, I'm Casey Gaysom.  And now,  recycling is  God damn it.  Do we have that?  I wear those pictures of  anals and cunts  I was supposed to see.  No, Casey Gaysom.  We got the bit.  E-Rock would have it in a second.  You know,  the person you trash all the time.  Why, is it on a sandwich?  We got to play the Casey Gaysom going in a break. 
[03:33:30]  That's one of my favorites.  Love that one.  Yeah, I got to piss like a racehorse.  All right.  Is Morgan here yet?  Morgan.  Morgan Spurlock.  Eyesway.  Eyesway.  Brother Joe wants in.  Oh.  Time to plug to you.  Yes, Brother Joe.  Hello, boys.  Hey, Anthony,  didn't we do one of those  stupid Long Island music festivals  with Anal Cunt?  I'm not even sure.  Probably.  I think Rotgut is the band  known for playing  with everyone.  We opened for everyone. 
[03:34:00]  I think so.  And never got that far.  We did something with them  over at the Rock.  Yeah, Anal Cunt.  We played with Anal Cunt.  Murphy's Law.  Yeah.  Fucking Motorhead.  Just love the bands.  Oh, those were the days.  Yeah, sure.  We will be playing  acoustic over at Smith's, right?  I hear tell  for my birthday.  And I think Mom  might be coming down  to do a rousing rendition  of Mercedes-Benz.  Why wouldn't she? 
[03:34:30]  Why wouldn't she?  Has she started drinking  now for it?  Rotgut has played on Lucy.  That's right.  Yeah, do you know  Rotgut's played on  one of those fucking stations here?  Lucy.  Yeah.  They play Naked Cowboy.  Naked Cowboy.  That was actually,  that was picked up  on a compilation  over in England.  I remember,  I think I got like  eight cents for it.  Nice.  Cash the check?  Where's my share?  I was thrilled  to have something published.  I got more money  from that  than Pat Duffy got  for working here  for two years.  I got 200 bucks 
[03:35:00]  at Christmas.  Oh, you did?  A little bonus?  Thank you, sir.  I did.  Did you thank Opie  like I did?  Very much.  Yes.  Why the fuck  didn't I get a thank you?  That comes out  of a joint fucking account,  you cocksuckers.  I didn't hear shit  from you fucking assholes.  Opie hands you  the fucking check.  You left?  I don't give a shit.  I left my fucking names  on it.  Opie and Anthony  Radio Network,  did you see  what the fuck  it said on it?  Thank you.  I didn't get one.  Fuck you,  it's months later now,  you cocksucker.  Holy shit.  I forgot about that.  One fucking thank you.  The real staff 
[03:35:30]  fucking thanked me.  The fake staff  didn't say shit.  You did walk out,  though,  when it was time.  I don't fucking care.  I was late for something.  I'm sure asleep.  You walked out  when it was time  to hand out  the big Christmas bonuses  to everybody.  And that's another thing.  You motherfucker.  I didn't do shit.  You held on  to those fucking things  until I left.  You could fucking  look like Santa  fucking Claus  handing them out.  I was here  the whole fucking day  for a show.  And then you wait  until I left  to hand out  the fucking bonus checks.  So you look like  Chris Kringle  and I'm fucking  Scrooge.  You're insane. 
[03:36:00]  That's why I didn't  get a thank you  from Pat D.  Douche.  Holy shit.  Now that I think about it,  I think...  Well, I haven't heard  a rant like that  in a while.  Yeah, thank you.  I think I did thank you  at the bar one.  Oh, who remembers you?  Stop it.  All right, Brother Joe,  we gotta go  before it gets over in here.  We're playing over  at Dexter's  this coming Saturday night.  That would be  Dexter's in  Riverdale, New Jersey.  It's a big club  just opened  and we gotta do good there 
[03:36:30]  so everybody  that wants to come...  A little dog  named Dexter.  All right.  Come on,  a little dog.  We just lost  our little dog  named Dexter.  He died.  All right, Brother Joe.  Travis is very upset.  We'll talk to you guys soon.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Later.  Where are those 260 pictures  of Dexter  I was supposed to see?  Oh, they're up  on Travis's MySpace.  No, no more pictures  of Dexter.  No, fuck Dexter  and his little  tight doggy ass.  All right, listen.  We gotta take a break.  We're gonna go to break  with the Casey Kasem?  Yes. 
[03:37:00]  Are you really mad at me?  No, I just got pissed  really bad.  Why?  I gotta pee.  I drank like  a whole thing of Gatorade  and some club soda,  a smoothie.  The, um,  I forgot, uh,  uh, Gatorade Rain  is terrific.  Good stuff.  Very good.  Less calories, less sugar, too.  I just needed something  besides fucking water today.  And then they got  a new one called  G-something,  which is amazing  by Gatorade.  Mmm.  And you still get  the same electric,  electrolytes.  Electrolytes.  Which is good  if you're working out,  pumping, aren't you?  Yes.  That's what I'm doing.  Yuck. 
[03:37:30]  Yuck.  All right, let me piss.  We had, we had  the gayest break today  that didn't make the radio  because, uh,  Ian was talking  about his guns  and how he,  he bought another gun  and then I go,  well, you don't need  a license for this gun.  This gun and Opie flexes  and then I have to flex.  It was so homoerotic  and made everybody  uncomfortable.  Why does it have  to be homoerotic?  I think it was just erotic. 
[03:38:00]  What do you think  of these guns, brother?  Brother,  let me tell you  something, brother.  You don't need  a permit for these.  It was just the gayest  fucking gym  rant bit  that we decided  not to put on the radio  until you pull the cord out.  Did they teach you that  at, uh, CSB?  To not pull the cord  out of your fucking microphone?  Here's the Casey case  and rant as we go to break.  I want to thank Tony  and, uh, Pat Duffy  for killing an hour and a half.  Yeah, they're good eggs. 
[03:38:30]  That works.  Thanks, guys.  Yes.  Oh, look, you're getting applause.  Oh, they liked it.  Oh, standing ovation.  Standing ovulation.  Very nice.  Nice.  And for the,  same with 26.  And for the record,  I, I, I still like Tony.  Tony's still my friend.  All right, thanks.  He's cool.  I like it.  Get the fuck out.  Fuck you!  He puts his hand out  to shake it.  Pat Duffy's a sweet boy.  He looks like he could  kill somebody,  but I think he cries.  And I want to.  I think he cries a lot  when he's by himself.  Tears behind that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, oh, yeah, yeah.  I do.  A lot of emotion.  I hate myself.  Yeah, I think you do. 
[03:39:00]  I really do.  That's terrible.  You're too young  to hate yourself.  Yeah, don't,  you have no idea.  Wait till you're 40 flurf.  Yeah.  I'm gonna be 30 flurf soon.  Yeah, right?  What planet is that  that goes around the sun  a lot slower?  Don't hate yourself.  I think you're,  I think you're talented, dude.  No, I hate yourself.  You gotta get that break  and I don't know  where it's gonna come.  I would love to pay you,  but we got fucking  20 guys behind the scenes.  Ask Steve.  And then I thought  I could get you on  Ron and Fez  and then I learned 
[03:39:30]  that half their staff  doesn't get paid.  Ask Steve how you get  a break like that.  Teasing, Steve.  I'm applying you do nothing  and you got a job.  So, that's all.  I don't know.  I'm teasing, Steve.  You know you're  a very good, um...  Steve knows at this point  no one's teasing with him.  No!  Yeah, he knows.  Hey.  Right, Steve?  I don't have a gun  on me right now.  Just don't get him mad.  Is Morgan Spurlock...  I fucking watched  this goddamn movie  for this interview. 
[03:40:00]  I think we're blown off.  If he doesn't show up,  I'm being pissed.  You know how nice  it was outside yesterday  and I'm sitting there  looking at his movie?  What?  It's gonna be 10 minutes.  But it's gonna be  a fucking five-minute interview.  Roman, come here.  Roman, when is he getting here?  When is he getting here?  I'm like in 10-15 minutes.  Did I give you a bonus, too?  No.  Can you just come by tomorrow?  Good.  Because now we gotta do  line of the day  and get the hell out.  I got visitors today.  Call him up  and see if he can do it tomorrow.  Did you want him to call?  Dude, he's fucking 20 minutes late. 
[03:40:30]  It's not my problem  and I really do want to talk to him.  Can I have me call him  on the hollering?  What?  Do you want to talk to him  on the hollering?  Oh, my God.  No, just call him  and ask him if he can do it tomorrow  if that's at all possible.  Tomorrow, the schedule,  the reps here,  he's booked up  from like 7 to 12.  Oh, is he?  Is he not gonna be there  for whatever he's booked up for, too?  I don't know.  Like he was not here today?  Well, it's traffic, though.  The poop's in town.  What?  Problem?  Oh, Iraq has something  more important to say  than you, Roland.  No, if we can't get him  for tomorrow, 
[03:41:00]  why don't we just have  Pat and Tony interview him here?  Ooh.  Very good.  Wow, Iraq is  executive producer.  But I watched the movie.  Fuck.  Just tell me what it was about.  If you take the break,  he should be here momentarily.  That's great.  Hey, Roland?  Yes?  Note to yourself,  and this is all I'm gonna say.  Eat less.  Sorry.  Don't give me movies.  I'm not saying this happened 
[03:41:30]  yesterday or this week.  I'm just saying in general.  And I will say this much.  Morgan Spurlock's movie  I enjoyed.  So I don't even want  to confuse the issue.  Be very careful  sending me movies  to watch  ahead of time  that might  be  not that great.  Oh.  That's all I'm saying.  I gave Kane  The Wire  to give it to you today.  Which one?  The Seasons of The Wire  on DVD.  No, I know,  but I'm talking about  for the show.  Like if,  I don't know,  let's say  somebody's coming in  and you're like,  oh, here's this movie 
[03:42:00]  to watch ahead of time.  I can't tell you that,  you know,  my mouth hurts  because it's biting down  on my bottom lip  and I start chewing  my own tongue.  Oh, okay.  I guess what I'm trying  to say is  blood pouring  out of your mouth  as you're interviewing  somebody.  I guess what I'm trying  to say,  in some situations  it might be better  to just not  get the movie  at time.  That's what I thought.  And you're pretty good  at this  because you get  the advanced reviews.  Oh, now you're  blaming Steve.  Steve, he took  a shot at you.  No, no, no.  For that one. 
[03:42:30]  If you're not,  just take a shot  at Steve.  Steve, I think  he took a shot  at you.  I love Rowan.  Ow.  Rape.  You know what  you should have done?  You know what  you should have done?  Have the movie.  Have the title  of the movie.  Have the name  maybe Willem Dafoe  on it.  That's why I sensed.  And then just burn  Platoon onto the copy.  So then you watch  and go,  that movie was great.  I'm not even going  to say it.  He was fantastic in it.  Maybe it's not  about Willem Dafoe.  Oh, I know.  I was just using  that as an example. 
[03:43:00]  Of course it was.  I'm just saying,  it's happened before.  That's all.  But it was.  And then you sit there  and like,  I know we're trying  to play the game  these days  and taking our shots  when we can.  Okay.  I always love the,  so did you guys  see the movie?  What'd you think?  So when you were  filming Platoon,  he wanted to talk  about the movie  for a while  and we wanted to  talk about  everything else  up to that point.  It's jokes, Roland. 
[03:43:30]  I know.  Go back and tell  your stupid  publicist friend.  It's just a joke.  I will.  What is Eastside Dave  doing?  I don't know.  Clowning about.  He probably just  figured out that  he could fuck  his own ass.  All right.  We're going to  wrap up next  with Morgan Spurlock.  Maybe,  maybe not.  It would be  much better tomorrow,  I'm thinking,  but let's see  what happens.  Okay, Roland?  All right. 
[03:44:00]  Wait,  what do you got?  Are you really  trying to put your  dick in your own ass?  You can't.  We've seen your dick.  It's not.  Oh, God.  He's pulling it  around his nutsack.  This is what you  do, Tony.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Look at the front  of him.  He looks like...  God damn it.  Stop.  Is he trying to  fuck himself in his  ass?  Yes.  That's as noon to  three.  How far in it?  Are you getting it?  I'm getting it a little 
[03:44:30]  bit, yeah.  You can't fuck  yourself in your  own ass.  What's wrong, Pat?  I hate to say this,  but I've done that  before.  You put your  dick in your own  ass?  Like, yeah.  Is that on your  CSB resume?  No.  I wish it was.  Tony, this is where  you leave.  This is below your  abilities.  Are you playing...  What are you doing  here today?  I don't know.  They brought me in.  I'm doing a show  prep for the Ron 
[03:45:00]  Fez Noon to Three  show.  Show prep?  Show prep.  I could do what's  in my ass.  I could always find  something real quick.  You know, it's not  that hard.  I don't think we  need...  You don't need it  today.  No, we did pretty  good today.  We don't need monkey  boy today.  Thank you.  Could you take the  hat off?  I gotta see that  hair.  That hairstyle's  great.  Hello, Anthony.  How are you?  Beautiful.  It's my new  character.  Oh, yes?  What's your new  character?  What's the name?  Balding, middle-aged, 
[03:45:30]  30-year-old.  Right, exactly.  And I'm here to say,  look at me now.  Hello.  That's fantastic.  All right,  Rafa's noon to three.  Yes.  Hey, uh...  Brilliant.  I love the O&A show,  though.  You're a baseball guy,  obviously, and you  know a lot of, uh...  It was making me laugh  yesterday when they  were making fun of you  because you come up  with factoids.  Yeah.  What's the big  factoid today in  baseball?  I think it's today.  It might be tomorrow,  though.  Well, I do know that,  uh...  Last night,  A-Rod passed Ted Williams  on the all-time 
[03:46:00]  home run list.  Yeah, we know that.  521, he got to 522.  But there's an anniversary  of a huge baseball event.  I think it's today.  Might be tomorrow.  Uh, I'll guess.  I'll say Jackie Robinson  broke into the, uh,  big leagues?  No!  Shit.  April 17th.  Uh...  I might be off by a day,  but I think...  Oh, oh, no,  I'll fucking say Hank Aaron  broke the home run record.  No!  All right, man, I'm out.  Travis knows?  Of course I do.  It's on your prep sheet. 
[03:46:30]  Where is it?  Wow.  Is that where I read it?  That's not fair!  Just please indulge me  and tell me  that's where you read it.  Oh, I thought I read it  on a placemat in a restaurant.  It was actually  the show prep today.  Oh, fuck.  That's...  It wasn't it?  Okay, uh,  55 years ago today.  50, so...  2007 minus 55 is...  It's 2008.  2008.  It's okay.  30...  Just, just go with...  I don't know.  Wait, I have to get 
[03:47:00]  the date down.  It would be 1953.  1953.  Okay, that's good.  47.  1953.  This is fucking hard.  In 1953, Major League Baseball?  Uh...  I'll say, uh,  Roy Campanella  fucking got into that car accident  which paralyzed him.  That's what I'll say.  Roy Campanella got into the car.  Yeah.  Get lost.  Oh, Dave.  What's the answer?  I, you know. 
[03:47:30]  No, obviously he doesn't.  You can fucking Google.  Go look it up.  This is bullshit.  Fuck twat the clown.  Get the fuck out of here.  What's the best doing to three?  Yeah.  Mickey Mantle!  Oh, the Mick.  Did what?  The, the, the, the, the  greatest home run of all time.  The 565 footer.  Oh, okay.  What do they call it?  The miracle home run  or something like that?  That was before  they had tape measure though.  So that's only been hypothesized.  Ah, they, I saw the black and white picture  where they show where it hit.  Yeah.  I know.  And Billy Crystal does that little thing. 
[03:48:00]  He caught it?  Next thing you know  you're gonna say the, uh,  Earth, Earth is only 6,000 years old.  No.  Earl believes that though, right?  Yes, he does.  Yeah, fucking Earl believes that.  Such a jackass.  Obviously it's 12,000.  Yes, of course, Dave.  How does Earl believe that?  Well.  All right, we're in a real tricky situation.  Why?  Because I got really tiggly.  Mm-hmm.  But we're like, how are we gonna break?  Maybe we break, but then I do surprise show. 
[03:48:30]  Ooh.  I'm gonna do surprise show in my pants.  You're gonna see like a surprise  big dark spot in the front.  All right, let's, uh, take a break.  Thank you, Pat.  Pat, hang in there.  Yes.  Seriously.  All right, don't worry.  You worry me.  All right.  Just keep working hard.  It'll pay off, I'm telling you.  You'll get paid in quat lubes.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets  and a situation that we can all understand,  whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
[03:49:00]  And here's what he writes.  Dear Casey,  this may seem to be a strange dedication request,  but I'm quite sincere,  and it'll need a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles,  but he was most certainly a part of...  Let's go start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Okay.  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, 
[03:49:30]  it's impossible to make those transitions,  and then you got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for,  but goddamn it,  if we can't come out of a slow record,  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay.  I want a goddamn concerted effort  to come out of a record  that isn't a fucking up-tempo record  every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know  what happened to the pictures  I was supposed to see this week.  This is the last goddamn time.  I want somebody who's his fucking brain 
[03:50:00]  to not come out of a goddamn record  that's up-tempo,  and I got to talk about a fucking dog dying.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll do it.  On XM 202.  Are you going to finally talk, Jimmy, or what, man?  Jesus, we've been here two hours.  I know, man.  I'm just getting shy.  I know.  You know, did you enjoy the Pat Duffy thing, though, 
[03:50:30]  at least, sitting back watching that whole thing go down?  Yeah, it was kind of cool.  Yeah, what do you like about it?  I like the way Pat carries himself.  You know, he's always good,  and the guy always shows a certain amount of spunk  when you don't think he's going to.  What about the chemistry between Tony and Pat Duffy  during that last hour and a half?  Yeah, I mean, I'm going to say decent, but not great.  I've seen better chemistry.  I've seen worse chemistry.  Yeah.  Sure.  And what about Ant's rant?  That was pretty...  No one was expecting that today.  Yeah, but, you know,  I'm always expecting something like that out of Anthony 
[03:51:00]  because when he rants, it's always funny.  Everybody knows that.  Why would I be shocked at Anthony having a brilliant rant?  What did you like about the rant?  The language he used and the fucking venom.  I like the venom.  God damn, Jimmy.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  We've got to welcome Morgan Spurlock to the show,  and first of all, we hate you  because now we have to go late today.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  They ruined it for you.  Very.  And we're all friends here,  and, like, I'm thinking, you know,  I'd be home now,  but now we've got to do the right thing  for your new movie.  Oh, thanks. 
[03:51:30]  I appreciate it.  The movie's called Where...  Where in the World's Osama Bin Laden.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And the premise is really, really good.  Morgan decided you're insane  that you're going to go...  And I'm the worst husband ever.  Yeah, yeah, because your wife...  Are you married?  I wasn't sure.  I'm married, yeah.  We're married now.  Okay, I wasn't sure if you guys were married,  but, yeah, his wife stayed home in Brooklyn  to have their kid,  and he decided that that was the perfect time,  which I think a lot of guys would agree with,  by the way.  Oh, hell yeah.  That I need to get away to the point, 
[03:52:00]  I'm going to go to the Middle East  and try to find Osama Bin Laden.  He'd rather almost be killed.  Right, than stay home.  Yeah, yeah, there's a chance I could be killed.  Well, which one was safer?  I didn't know if it was the hormonal imbalances  or, you know, going to find him.  Yeah.  What a great idea for a movie, though.  Oh, thanks, man.  Very good.  I don't even know where to begin.  Well, how many countries were you in?  I know Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan.  Yeah, Morocco.  We were in Israel, the Palestinian territories.  Right.  Yeah, and Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
[03:52:30]  Right.  We went to Pakistan.  That's fucking ballsy, man.  Yeah.  Were you in Jakarta?  Yeah, no.  We were in Rewalpendi.  We shot in Islamabad.  We shot in...  That's a nice area.  It's beautiful there, yeah.  I summer there.  I summer in Peshawar.  And what I like, too,  someone early on in the movie,  you know, you got the hip facial hair going on  and somebody said,  you might want to grow one of those big beards  just to try to fit in a little.  Well, the guy even said,  because I'm a big six foot two pale white guy,  you know, like, I'm white, I'm pink, I'm red. 
[03:53:00]  Those are my three colors.  He goes, then you may want to hit the tanning salon  a little bit.  Right.  Yeah.  How did they take you over there?  Especially, like, I mean,  there's such a high, I guess,  Muslim influence or whatever,  where anti-Americanism in Pakistan,  I mean, they hate Musharraf.  I mean, how were you received there?  Well, the thing is, you know,  there's people over there who, you know,  who do hate America and hate what it is,  but the thing is,  it's a very small group of people.  There's people over there  who love what America stands for  and they love the American people,  you know, while they hate kind of  what the government and our foreign policy is,  you know, they still love what America means.  Right.  And they hate Osama bin Laden  just as much as we do.  So to hear that from people is amazing. 
[03:53:30]  I was blown away by that  because, yeah, you talk to a lot of different people  from all these countries  and the underlying theme,  for the most part,  was people hate Bush,  hate the American government,  but don't hate the American people.  I'm pretty much paraphrasing what you just said,  which I was like, what?  Yeah.  Because that's not what I see  through the media and all that crap.  Yeah, well, and the other point that you made,  but I want to stress  and maybe go with a little bit,  that they also dislike Osama bin Laden.  And why is that?  Well, because they feel like, you know,  he's disrupted their lives as well.  Now, especially in the views points of the West, 
[03:54:00]  suddenly all Muslims get grouped into,  oh, they're crazy and they hate us.  And so they feel like,  listen, he's ruined our life too.  Now, every time I come into your country,  I get stopped, I get searched,  I get held up in security.  It's always the fanatics  that wreck it for everybody else.  That's right.  In a religion?  Yeah, all the little kooks.  The kooks ruin it for everybody.  You know what would really freak me out  is the thought that  I might be taken prisoner  and have my head sawn off.  Yeah, believe me, that's...  Now, that's got to be the...  Worse than being shot 
[03:54:30]  or something like that  is the thought of  you're taken prisoner  and they saw your head off.  On YouTube.  Yeah.  And then you're there  just headless.  Yeah.  And dead.  I'd much rather get beaten up  by like six high school girls.  Yeah.  It didn't take a line  you just to straighten you out.  It didn't look like  you had a lot of security  in all these places.  No, we traveled...  I know you did, you know...  When we went to Tora Bora,  it was like the governor  of the province there  says, no, it's fine, don't worry,  you can go to Tora Bora  and then he sends like  21 guys with guns 
[03:55:00]  out to Tora Bora with us.  Right.  And so he's like,  no, it's safe, don't worry  and we got a little armed,  you know, a little militia traveling.  Were you allowed  or were you,  would you be,  if you were allowed,  armed?  Yeah.  Well, the thing is  when you're armed,  you know,  when you're carrying a gun,  suddenly you start  to send a different message.  So we personally  never carried guns with us.  Even concealed nothing?  Yeah, cool.  So the minute you get caught  by somebody with a gun  and they think that,  you know,  they think your intentions are,  not self-defense,  they think your intentions  are much more aggressive.  I just learned like enough  to say,  look, everyone has a gun 
[03:55:30]  around here.  Yeah, exactly.  I just, I have a gun.  I'm just trying to fit in.  Yeah, that's it.  You would appreciate this.  It doesn't give away  the movie really,  but he's on an army base  and he gets to fire  some weapons  and all of a sudden  I think you said,  can I fire a rocket launcher?  Yeah.  And they actually said yes  and then the next thing,  he put his freaking shades on  to look like an animal.  Yeah, they gave me,  those are army issue sunglasses.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they say,  here, put these on  so there's these fantastic  like Terminator sunglasses  they gave me  and I fired a rocket launcher.  And just the reaction, 
[03:56:00]  it was like right the fuck on.  You could tell  he was doing it  for the first time.  That was a one take thing  because you were like,  wow, that was cool.  I always said that like war,  aside from the chance  that you're going to be killed  in a horrific manner,  is probably the most fun thing  guys can do.  Yeah, exactly.  Like it's fun equipment,  big toys to play with,  explosions.  Yeah, we got to shoot like,  I was shooting like  the big 50 cal machine guns.  And we're just laughing  while you're doing it  because it's hysterical.  Oh, it's great.  You're like, 
[03:56:30]  woohoo!  I thought of being  on the receiving end.  That ruins the whole fun of war.  Did you count how many shots  you had to get  for this trip to the Middle East?  I got like I think nine shots  like yellow fever,  hepatitis A, B,  all that stuff before I split.  That scene was pretty funny too.  There's definitely some humor  in this movie.  Okay, because you're sitting  next to Jimmy.  And I got them again  before I came here today.  It looked like,  I don't know if it was  filmed out of sequence,  but right after you got  all the shots from the doctor  that was also in your other movie. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, Dr. Darryl Isaacs.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's the character.  He's walking down the sidewalk  and you can tell his arm  is just...  Well, it's one of those  because it's like five shots  in each arm  and so much stuff,  like so many antibodies  floating through my body.  So for the rest of the day  I'm like,  I don't know if I'm going  to throw up  or if I feel kind of good.  You could just tell  it was just awful.  He didn't want to swing  his arms at all as he was.  You just drink gutter water  from New York  and just go,  yeah, it can't affect me.  It can't affect me now.  I can do anything I want.  So the movie pretty much 
[03:57:30]  traces the steps  of Osama bin Laden, right?  Yeah, we try and figure out  what makes this guy tick,  how do you get into his head,  figure out why people  follow this guy  and then we end up  all the way over  into Afghanistan, Pakistan.  I was telling the guys  that I looked down  at my BlackBerry  during the movie.  I had a lot of stuff  to do for the show today.  Right.  And I missed why  the Hasidic Jews  were slapping him in the face.  Yeah, we get attacked  by the Hasids.  You want to explain that scene  because that was really interesting.  Yeah, we're in the middle  of Israel  and we'd just been  in the Palestinian territories 
[03:58:00]  and we were just in Israel  and had come off of,  you know, we were out  with the Israeli bomb squad  where these guys have  like 12 to 18 bomb threats a day  and a little robot comes out  and like disarms,  you know, blows open this case  and it ends up having  not a bomb in it  but it's a great scene.  And so we go from there  and start talking  to some of the Orthodox  over in another neighborhood  just trying to ask them questions  and our producer says,  no, it's fine.  I talk to them all the time  don't worry about it.  So we go in there  and we're just trying to  ask some political questions  and then suddenly people freak out.  You know, this old man comes up  and starts shoving me  and apparently, you know,  they don't take too kindly  to the big video cameras so much. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, they were very unhappy.  But they came out of the woodwork.  There was only a couple  and then I guess  the word gets out somehow.  Oh, yeah.  And then suddenly...  The next thing you know  they're just coming from everywhere  to defend their people.  Wait a minute.  Pushy Jews?  I don't believe that.  And there was a lot of pushing  in that scene.  Yeah.  But what I love,  I love the one guy who comes up  who's like really afraid.  He's like, he's like,  listen, no, I'm, you know,  most of us here aren't like  those four people,  those five people over there  who were screaming and yelling at you,  you know,  who were trying to push you out of here.  Why were they so dead set  against you being there?  Well, they hate, 
[03:59:00]  they're really,  they don't like outsiders coming in,  for one, you know.  It's like,  I've talked to people since then,  like people who've gone there  with their girlfriends,  their wives,  and like the girls  who go through there  and if they aren't completely covered,  you know,  like even if there's an arm showing,  like they've been spit on  in the neighborhoods.  Yeah, God forbid  they are treated like human beings.  That's right.  And then he was in Afghanistan  talking to like the Taliban.  I mean,  were some of those guys  the Taliban,  the actual Taliban?  Yeah, we did a great interview  with like who was the guy  who was the Taliban ambassador  to Pakistan,  you know,  and just really got a lot of great views.  They love cutting heads off  the Taliban. 
[03:59:30]  They love that.  Well, they had it,  they used to have a...  Come to the soccer field.  Yeah, the soccer field.  I was going to say,  it was like the Olympic Stadium  over there  where they used to cut people's heads off.  Oh, yeah.  How'd you know  you weren't going to be hurt?  Like Daniel Pearl  set up an interview,  I mean,  in Pakistan.  Yeah, you don't know.  I mean,  that's the thing.  We had a couple great fixers,  that's what they call  the people on the ground  who are helping you out.  Fixers.  Yeah, these fixers who they hope  you hope...  It's like the wolf.  Yeah, exactly.  Mr. Wolf,  they wear tuxedos.  Yeah.  You know,  and you hope these people  are like,  you know,  going to look out for you  and so our guys,  you know,  just tried to steer us  in the right direction  so we were lucky.  You're always lucky 
[04:00:00]  because, I mean,  things could always go  a different direction.  Anything threatening or scary?  Was there any moments over there  that you were just  doubting your situation?  Like, oh, I mean,  shit.  Yeah, like when we were  embedded with the troops,  I mean,  these guys are heroes  and we're following  the governor's convoy one day,  the governor of the province  that we're in  and his convoy gets ambushed  by the Taliban  so we're there.  It's like they jump out  and the Afghan National Army  fires on and kills  one of the Taliban  and that's in the film  and, you know,  there's another day  we're riding along  with the military  and there's an IED 
[04:00:30]  that they discover  about a kilometer or less  in front of us  so we get diverted,  you know,  back to the base  while the explosive guys  go detonate the IED.  I mean,  it's scary.  Yeah, intense.  Wow, yeah.  It was just,  I mean,  you just talking to the,  you know,  the average person  in all these countries  really,  they have the same  type of goals we do  for the most part.  And that's for me,  that's stuff we don't get  to hear and see here  in the States.  No, not at all.  That's why it was really  interesting to see  another point of view.  And so we're talking  to these people.  I mean,  it might be your point of view.  You might be pushing  your own agenda  but who knows. 
[04:01:00]  No, like these guys,  like we talk to people  who are like.  They're all about  making sure their kids  have proper schooling  and medical,  you know,  like a house over their head,  food, everything.  It's like I could be talking  to my neighbor in Brooklyn  and they're telling me  the same thing, you know.  I mean, it's a good thing  to hear, I think.  Yeah.  And that's the majority  of the folks we talk to.  It's incredible.  And I told these guys,  because I was talking  about the movie earlier,  a lot of wrestling fans  over there.  A lot of wrestling.  They love the WWE.  How does that happen?  How does that happen?  He's walking into  these scary homes.  Seriously, 
[04:01:30]  they have a lot less than us.  They got old school TV  that we were watching  when we were like  growing up.  And there's a wrestling match on.  Of course there is.  Why?  Did you ever get to the bottom  of why a lot of those people  like those people?  It's the same reason.  But I think it's the same reason  everybody likes wrestling.  You know what it is.  It's the same thing  that this whole thing's about.  It's good versus evil.  It's us versus them.  It's the people who,  you know,  it's the people's champion  versus somebody else.  You know,  it's those commonalities,  you know,  and it's amazing.  Well, the best line,  we were in Pakistan  and we go to this guy  and here you are  in the middle of Pakistan 
[04:02:00]  and there's like,  they're selling wrestling T-shirts  and the guy,  the one guy says,  I says,  look,  they even love wrestling here  and he goes,  all the people like the wrestling.  And I said,  why?  I said,  why do you guys like the wrestling?  He goes,  because wrestling is fair.  It's fair.  And I said,  and I told him,  I said,  well,  you know,  you know,  wrestling is fixed.  And he goes,  maybe,  maybe,  but when it's for the belt,  it's not fixed.  Oh,  they don't even know.  Oh,  look at Sam agreeing.  Yeah,  yeah,  I got to agree with that.  Speaking of like T-shirts  and souvenirs and stuff, 
[04:02:30]  the Jihad T-shirts,  they sell them on the streets  in some of these places?  Yeah.  Just says Jihad  on a nice T-shirt.  And that guy,  what you love,  he's wearing the Jihad T-shirt  and you pan up to his hat  and he's wearing  an Atlanta Braves baseball cap.  That's hilarious.  Ironically,  he has less radical views  than Ted Turner.  I got to tell you,  I was so psyched for Norton,  I told him,  I saw him on the way in,  I got my HBO voting kit,  you know,  for the Emmys  and inside there  was his DVD 
[04:03:00]  inside the case.  It was pretty awesome.  Wow.  Yeah,  it was pretty fancy.  Very, very nice.  That ever happened.  It was big time.  I don't expect it to,  but it would be nice.  It would be.  Is this Jay Moore?  Boy,  would I change.  Jay.  Hey,  guys.  Hey,  Jay.  Jay Moore.  Morgan Spurlock,  huge fan.  Oh,  rock on,  likewise.  I loved your TV show.  Oh,  it comes back June 3rd,  the season 3 comes out.  What network,  my friend?  On FX,  season 3.  Sweet.  Morgan Spurlock,  I have a question,  do you know who's  at Caroline's this weekend? 
[04:03:30]  Is Osama Bin Laden  opening up for somebody  named Jay Moore?  No,  I'll be there.  Jay rules.  Yeah,  Jim Norton will be at Caroline's  doing his mediocre horseshit  tonight through Sunday.  Tickets going fast,  which is why I've been  plugging like a fucking  animal for a week.  Because obviously  it's selling out.  No kidding.  That's amazing.  I've got to go out  and get tickets.  Yeah.  Oh yeah,  good luck.  They're going like hotcakes.  Hey Spurlock, 
[04:04:00]  I know the headliner.  I might be able to  get you in for free  because I slept with  Louis Ferranda a few times.  Oh,  nice.  You're killing me.  You'll never reach your bonus  unless you climb into bed.  That's a damn good Louis.  Hey cats,  Jesus cats,  what do you want me to do?  I paid the guy  to know I'm in a leg.  Look,  Linda,  I can't give you that money.  I gave it all to Linda Smith.  Hey,  do you guys know  I'm in the movie  Street Kings?  No. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah,  I have a big cop mustache  for Kerry Collins  when he was on the Super Bowl.  Oh,  you shitting me?  Yeah,  that's when I got roided out.  I'm up at 200 pounds  in that movie.  Oh my gosh.  But on the message board,  I tried logging into Whack Bag  and it wouldn't let me.  I was like,  I don't think any of these  even know.  Otherwise,  maybe it wouldn't have  gotten beaten by  prom night opening weekend.  Oh shit.  Jesus Christ.  So maybe if Morgan Spurlock  can get the word out  that there's,  you know,  some TV actors  making good movie choices. 
[04:05:00]  Come on.  That's what I like to hear.  That's right.  Morgan Spurlock,  never forget what  Al Pacino told me.  You bug me.  Hey,  why is Voss killing me yesterday?  I got like 19 text messages  that Voss was killing me.  What the fuck did he say?  I said,  Sylvester the cat  has an opinion.  That's Sylvester.  What the fuck did Voss say?  I don't even remember.  I don't think he meant it.  Seriously.  Was it a last comic standing?  I don't remember.  I don't know,  Jay.  I don't remember. 
[04:05:30]  I don't remember that one.  Yeah,  you couldn't pull some strings  for Voss?  We almost renamed the show  Quadruple Voss's Club Price.  All those comics  got some nerve  complaining about that show  at all.  Yeah,  it went corporate.  Yeah,  it was a network thing.  But you know what?  Y'all got on TV,  you cry babies.  It is true.  The only non-comic  in the room left.  Great.  Anyway,  but you know,  gang,  it's good.  I kid Morgan Spurlock.  Without him, 
[04:06:00]  we wouldn't be able  to watch Slides  have sex with Face Drive.  Anyway.  Hey,  I love you.  I loved the Muslim  one you did,  and I can't wait  to see your new show  come back,  Morgan Spurlock.  Oh,  right on,  man.  Thank you very much.  Thank you,  Jay.  I appreciate it.  Hey,  Jay,  before you go,  are you following  the Pope's visit?  You got anything on that?  Bro,  the cover of the New York  Times yesterday,  it looked like Ron Wood  getting off of the Stones jet  and it was so hilarious.  I thought it was so windy out,  he had to hold his yarmulke  in his hand  and he had his hands up 
[04:06:30]  like,  get down and  put it in the rugby room,  man.  I mean,  I swear to God,  the Pope walked out  of that plane  like he was about  to announce  he replaced Mick Taylor.  Mick Taylor,  wow.  All right,  Jay,  thank you for calling in.  Always a pleasure.  Absolutely.  Well,  do me a favor.  Could you guys get the word  out on the Street Kings?  Be proud of it.  With my boyfriend, 
[04:07:00]  Keanu Reeves?  Yes.  Oh my God,  that guy's so beautiful.  He took me out of my game.  Really?  I swear to God,  and he's like the nicest,  kindest,  straightest guy in the world.  Really?  But every guy wants him  to be gay  because they know  their girlfriends  will go down on him  the second they leave the room.  But he's super nice,  but he took me out of my game.  Like,  I'm fairly attractive  and I'm looking at him  between takes like,  wow,  look at the lips on this guy.  Do girls like him? 
[04:07:30]  I never saw...  A couple.  Yeah,  just one or two.  I heard the greatest thing  about Keanu Reeves  when they were doing  the Matrix,  the last one down in Australia.  He gave like  one or two of his points  to the entire crew  that were working on the movie.  And so basically,  like everybody  who worked on that film  that were like gaffers  and electricians,  like he ended up  buying all those guys' houses  as a result.  You know,  it's amazing.  That's pretty cool.  Damn.  What a guy.  Jay,  I want to get this out.  Joe Wagner from South Jersey.  Can you guys please tell  the great Mr. Jay Moore 
[04:08:00]  that I thought  that was him in the movie?  And Street Kings  was very good.  Look at that.  He didn't even...  He saw it with...  He didn't even...  I'm unrecognizable  in this movie.  No thanks.  Well,  between the weight gain  and the mustache,  maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah,  and I got like a  Bible salesman haircut.  I mean,  you do a movie  with Forrest Whitaker  and Keanu Reeves  and they won't want you  to be the tough one.  Why didn't you do it?  Why didn't you do  promotion for the movie? 
[04:08:30]  Because it kind of  turned into maybe  like a rapper-style movie,  like the common  in the game  or on the poster,  but they only have  one scene.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah,  so that's why  I'm just sticking  with the Ghost Whisper.  I show up every day  and they never cut me out.  Yeah.  I've seen that.  Sticking that money,  sticking together  like water and flour  to make that  slow, steady dough.  Fucking J.  My hip-hop skills,  Tracy Morgan would say, 
[04:09:00]  my hip-hop skills  are legendary.  Legendary.  Yo,  you should do  a documentary  about Tracy.  Yeah.  I remember one time,  we smoked Sherm  and we were finger-effing  in the handball court.  I would've said it  all the way,  but I got my man,  my baby man,  I gotta take him  to preschool.  Otherwise,  I got me swearing up  on Bruce Feet.  We might've won that game 
[04:09:30]  if it wasn't for Doug Flutie,  but you ain't Doug Flutie,  Spurlop.  You ain't no goddamn  Doug Flutie.  I swear to God,  I'm a nutty.  I didn't say hell,  Mary.  I said 23 times  and get back  in the huddle.  That was exactly  like Tracy.  What are you talking  about?  Tracy,  exactly.  Tracy just goes off  and you're like,  what the fuck  is Tracy saying?  You want to say 
[04:10:00]  hi on the radio?  You want to say  something?  You want to say  the pirate stink?  Say just my friend  on the radio.  Is he putting  on the phone?  Boom!  Pirate stink.  Pirate stink.  Say Rich Voss stinks.  Rich Voss stinks.  We already have it  from the mouths of babes.  From the mouths of babes.  Jay's kid is talking.  How weird is that?  That is fucked up.  Street Kings.  Can we please get  thrown out, gentlemen?  Street Kings, 
[04:10:30]  Street Kings  starring Jay Moore.  in theaters now.  Yeah, let's see  if we can be the first  to make more money  the second weekend.  Yeah, let's blow off  Morgan Spurlock's movie.  What?  No, we can do both.  Yeah, you can do both.  I see one Saturday.  It's double feature weekend.  Yeah, a little double feature.  Yo, it's all love.  Love you, Morgan Spurlock  before Morgan Spurlock  knew my love.  It's legendary.  I love Morgan Spurlock  so much  I'm going to take him  behind him middle school  and get him pregnant. 
[04:11:00]  I love that goatee you got.  Tickle my back.  I hope you still got  that big mustache Morgan Spurlock.  I got my 1975  porn star rocking.  Yeah, that's what I got  in that movie Street Kings  and mustache  of Flavor Saver.  Flavor Saver.  My wife said,  you know why  mustache rides are free?  Because they have to be.  Nothing tickles.  Get away from me.  I want baby George  with his grandpa. 
[04:11:30]  Hey, where's Jim Norton  going to be this weekend?  Funny you should ask Tracy.  I'll be at Caroline's.  I miss my daughter,  Jimmy Norton.  J. Moore's my uncle.  I need real ch...  Uh-oh.  There you go.  That wasn't us, Jay.  No.  That was the FCC called in.  And pulled the plug out.  That wasn't us.  I want to ask him...  That was a very abrupt ending.  No, I don't know what happened.  But I wanted to ask Jay  what his kid is doing 
[04:12:00]  while he's just losing his mind  in this big escalator.  Yeah, I know.  It's got to be scaring  the shit out of his kid.  What's wrong with daddy?  I'm calling the police.  So where in the world  is Osama bin Laden?  Then Saudi Arabia.  Yeah, crazy.  Pretty crazy place, huh?  Yeah, it's amazing.  I mean, the thing about Saudi Arabia  is there's like this facade country  where it's like,  no, we adhere to the religion,  all these things.  And then behind closed doors,  there's like party scenes  and rock and roll scenes  and like a huge music scene  and a drug scene  and like anything you want.  Anything you want,  you can get in Saudi Arabia,  but it's all behind closed doors. 
[04:12:30]  You walked around in a mall  that looked like any mall in America  except for the fact  that they were all wearing sheets.  Yeah, they're all rocking around  in like the buyers  and the local clothes  and yeah, nobody would talk to me.  Really?  No.  Hey, did you see Chopping,  what was it called?  Chopping Square or something  where they chopped all the hands off?  Oh, Chop Chop Square.  Chop Chop Square.  Yeah, we went to Chop Chop Square.  We did a scene in Chop Chop Square.  We go to Chop Chop Square  and we stand right over the grate  where they cut people's heads off  in the morning  and the little kids play soccer  there in the afternoons.  It's crazy.  Did you see any of the action?  No, we missed the action.  We got there like a day or two 
[04:13:00]  after a woman was beheaded  for drug smuggling.  Okay, how often do they do it?  I don't know.  I didn't see a schedule,  but I was on the lookout.  I thought it was for the evil crime  of her being raped or something.  Would they have let you watch?  Yeah, I think they would.  I don't think they'd let us watch  with a camera,  but I think if you'd have gotten up there,  they can't really stop you from watching.  Wow.  Yeah, it's crazy.  It's intense.  He was convicted of whistling  in public.  Yeah, it's so lovely.  Fucking stupid.  Yeah, adultery.  They'll get killed for adultery. 
[04:13:30]  Yeah.  The creepiest scene in the movie,  and I don't think I'm giving much away.  If I am, you can stop me, certainly.  But they told you where Osama bin Laden  used to live.  Used to live?  Yeah.  And you guys went out there,  but you didn't make much of that  in the movie for some reason.  You guys took a quick look  and then you were gone.  That's why I think I'm bringing it up  because it seems like there's more there.  Yeah, well, we went to this.  Like the windows were all blown out.  Yeah, we went to this old ratty place  where he used to be,  and I think he kind of like,  you know,  once he fled to go to Afghanistan  and, you know,  and become one.  Was that his last residence? 
[04:14:00]  That was like his last residence  in Saudi Arabia, yeah,  which he came back to  after he like fought the Soviets  over in Afghanistan.  He came back and was living there  and then fled the country again  when they basically told him  he had to leave.  That was really creepy to see, man.  That's a creepy place.  He was walking around  in a very empty,  it wasn't that great of a house.  It's in the middle of a desert, man.  Yeah, it was a horrible place, really.  It looks like, you know,  a trailer park  out in the middle of the desert.  Right.  Yeah.  It was beat up  and, yeah,  it looked terrible.  What are you going to say  if you met him?  Oh, I can't actually  give the movie away.  That's kind of stupid.  No, everybody, 
[04:14:30]  it's already out.  I didn't find him.  You know,  I didn't get the, you know,  the Ed McMahon  Prize Patrol $25 million check.  It's a tough interview to get.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  These days.  Everyone said  that he's in Pakistan.  Yeah, everybody says  he's in that tribal area.  You know,  everywhere that you see,  everybody's pointing a stare  to like, go that way.  He's up in that mountains.  I mean, I think by the time  we get to the border,  right where, you know,  right where we stop  and I'd say at that point  we're probably 50 to 75 miles away  from where everybody  was saying he was.  You think he's still alive?  I think he's still alive.  Yeah, I do.  Why didn't you go up closer?  You couldn't. 
[04:15:00]  Well, we could, you know,  but, you know,  at that point my wife  was about two weeks away  from having our baby.  There was a madrasa,  like a school  that was blown up  like a week before  where they said  it was al-Qaeda militants  that were in there  so the anti-American sentiment  was like skyrocketed  in that area.  So, I mean,  we had gotten in there  and I'd have been, you know,  YouTube video number one.  You think so?  Yeah, I mean,  it would have been bad news.  I mean, even like  we had a Pakistani journalist,  like a guy who was like  our tour guide  taking us through  the country,  making sure we were  going to the right places  and not going anywhere  that was going to really  get us killed  and he said,  listen, dude,  I'm a Pakistani 
[04:15:30]  and I'm not going in there.  He goes, it's bad.  He goes, right now  it is bad.  Wow.  You should have just  walked through so arrogantly  like with a radio  with rock music playing  and nobody would have  bothered you.  Big American flag shirt.  This couldn't be happening.  Yeah, like that.  Like those,  like the 1980 movies  of the guy on the subway  with the boombox  saying, what do you  have a problem with this?  Yeah.  Born in the USA.  Big American flag t-shirt.  That's right.  Just walking around  with cowboy boots  and a cowboy hat on.  Big rodeo belt buckle  with USA on it.  Where's Osama,  motherfuckers? 
[04:16:00]  Yeah, and they would  just be like,  this can't be.  Musharraf has to be  doing this as a joke  with a rifle.  You walked around  the caves in Afghanistan  and you're such an ass  actually, Morgan.  Like you had, what,  21 guys like protecting you  as you were like  up on those hills?  Well, there's the other  thing is we're going  through there  because what happens  is Al-Qaeda,  they say,  is still out over those hills  so basically as soon  as we got there  those guys got over the hills  and scattered up  over the mountains.  But you showed them  like running 
[04:16:30]  and collecting this nut.  Yeah, those guys  run down the hill  and jump in this tree  which they call  like a nut-nut tree  where basically  if you eat these nuts  you can like, you know,  go at it all night long.  You can get a nice  rock hard on it.  Yeah, and so  they're up in the tree  they're shaking the nuts  out of the tree  and they're over there  eating them like crazy  like hand over the house.  No, no, no,  the Afghan police  that we were with.  Oh, it's funny.  How great is that?  Those guys are  wolfing down  their Viagra nuts.  He's just sitting there  making fun of them  looking up as these guys  are just scampering 
[04:17:00]  trying to get as many  nuts as possible.  So the tribal areas  are really, what is it,  like a no man's land?  There's just no way  to go through there?  Oh, it's like the Wild West.  You know, like it's  there's no, there's like  the U.S. can't just go  marching in there  because it's like warlords,  you know, still tribal lords  that run the whole country  and run all these agencies.  That's what they're called.  They're called agencies.  Agencies.  Yeah.  Do they have like houses?  Are they intents?  I don't know.  No, like where they live  it's like when you see  pictures of it  it's incredible  because they have  these big giant  like mud fortresses  like these giant walls  that look like castles  you know, you feel like  you're like back 
[04:17:30]  in a whole other world.  You might as well be.  Yeah, you might as well be.  It's true.  Do you mean like  are you like liberal  or conservative?  Where are you?  I'm kind of in the middle.  I grew up in West Virginia.  You know, I grew up  shooting guns.  I like guns.  What I like about your  documentary is that  I don't feel for the most part  that you're trying to shove  like the liberal point of view  or an agenda in general  down your throat.  You're just kind of  you got a good style, man.  Well, I like people  to make up their own mind.  You know, I don't like  to be told what to do  as my pregnant wife 
[04:18:00]  would tell you.  That's why I like  Michael Moore's movies.  He does the same thing.  No agenda.  Very down the middle.  His movies are entertaining  and I do like them  but yeah, you get that  feeling sometimes  like alright  sometimes  we get it.  Jesus Christ.  From beginning to end.  In between the beginning credits  and end credits  you get that feeling  he's trying to push  an agenda.  Wow.  Yeah, so I'm a big fan  of people kind of  making up their own mind  at the end of the film.  Yeah.  So you got the TV show  what else?  Are you going to do  another movie?  TV show's coming out.  Any ideas for 
[04:18:30]  Yeah, we got some ideas  nothing we've like  settled on yet.  You know, my wife says  the next movie needs to be  about like, you know  puppies and flowers  you know, something  where I'm not going to  go get killed somewhere.  Well, don't listen to that.  Yeah, exactly.  And you gave birth in water?  Yeah, she had the baby at home.  We had the  What I was thinking is  what a mess you guys  are like sitting in.  Yeah.  Wow.  Like a tub of Jell-O stews.  You need some scrubbing  bubbles in the tub  after that one, right?  Yeah, because  Yeah.  I mean, because they  make it sound like  oh, how romantic 
[04:19:00]  you know, you give birth  to your kid in a  in a birthing tub  In a birthing tub  and I'm like, yeah, wow  and there's soft music  the water's probably  the perfect temperature  blah, blah, blah  It's nice  up until you realize  But then you're thinking  what?  You're insane.  And then at the end  you're like  sitting in that soup  What am I sitting in?  Right.  Looks like the  tomato soup canning factory.  All right, Morgan  we gotta get out of here.  It's awesome, guys  thanks for sticking around  man, I appreciate it  No worries, it's worth it  if your movie was mediocre  we would have been long gone  Where in the world  is Osama Bin Laden?
