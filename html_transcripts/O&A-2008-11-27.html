<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a studio guest, Sharon Osbourne, who discussed her life with Ozzy Osbourne, the challenges of managing his career and health, and the family's reality TV show.  This segment also included a lengthy, graphic, and sexually explicit discussion about a caller's request for oral sex from his girlfriend, contingent upon him receiving a hepatitis test.  Jimmy Norton's obsessive fandom of Black Sabbath was also a prominent feature, with detailed recounting of a photo opportunity with the band.  Commercial breaks included ads for dog food, tax relief, GEICO, credit repair, and SiriusXM. The segment concluded with discussion of “PalTalk,” specifically mentioning “Stalker Patty” and her alleged misuse of listener funds, followed by a video of a peewee football brawl and further discussion of childhood sports.  The language used throughout was consistently vulgar and sexually explicit.

The show then transitioned to a segment featuring a live webcam porn viewing with a female caller, Patty, who identified herself as a 50-year-old virgin.  The hosts encouraged her participation, using explicit language to describe the sexual acts depicted. This was followed by audio clips from Dateline NBC's "To Catch a Predator," with commentary from the hosts.  A police officer, Kevin, then called in to share anecdotes about arresting people. The conversation shifted to political attack ads, with the hosts and callers creating their own offensive versions. The segment concluded with a graphic discussion of a news story involving a developmentally disabled man sexually assaulted with a plumber’s snake, with several callers contributing insensitive jokes.  Al Jorgensen from Ministry and Adam West were in studio during this segment.


The next segment featured a chaotic in-studio conversation with Raven from Ministry and Killing Joke, along with Uncle Al, Sunset Thomas, and porn star Rebecca Love. Uncle Al recounted a story about his keyboard technician attempting to have sex with a sleeping ostrich while on LSD.  The conversation then shifted to Rebecca Love's career, including her adult film award nomination and experiences in the industry. A demonstration of sex toys followed, involving Rebecca. The segment was filled with crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and profanity.

The show continued with a segment featuring crude comments about a cameraman, followed by a female caller giving a graphic description and demonstration of oral sex techniques. This transitioned into a hostile exchange with a female listener who requested a Tom Waits song, with the hosts using deeply offensive and misogynistic language.  Comedian Bill Burr then joined the studio.  Their conversation covered Burr's experiences in Los Angeles, gun ownership (including Anthony's gun collection), conspiracy theories (specifically about the Rothschild family), hunting, fishing, political conventions, stand-up comedy's physical demands, health concerns, and bizarre doctor interactions. The segment concluded with a remembrance of Del Martin and a discussion of body image and fitness.

Bill Burr's appearance continued into another segment, beginning with banter about his upcoming performance and his reluctance to go home for Christmas.  This led to a discussion of a hostage situation where the perpetrator sent hostages for beer, which spiraled into a discussion about the Illuminati, government conspiracies, microchips in passports, and the control of information.  A listener sent rum, prompting discussion of the listener’s name, “Big Black Dick.” The conversation then moved through topics including the iPhone, Bob Kelly's technological skills, a story about a staff member, Roland, and his outburst, Madonna’s physique, a car accident story, predictions about Obama and McCain's presidential campaign speeches, and speculation about potential unrest following an Obama victory.  Burr also discussed his gun collection, leading to a discussion about gun control and the Second Amendment. The segment ended with a discussion of the Patriot Act, government surveillance, jokes about the Rothschild family, and a comedic, vulgar analysis of Lil Wayne's "Lollipop."


A subsequent segment focused on Run-DMC’s "Rock Box,"  evolving into a racially charged discussion of musical taste, including homophobic comments about Lil Wayne's "Lollipop" and Madonna's "Ray of Light."  The hosts analyzed a sexually explicit freestyle rap by Shaquille O'Neal about Kobe Bryant. Louis C.K. then called in, discussing his stand-up routine, divorce, and views on sex and relationships in crude terms.  The segment concluded with an awkward attempt to get a guest, “Baby Girl,” to sing from *Oliver!* and a threatening call from another listener. The language remained consistently vulgar and offensive throughout.

Finally, the show featured Coke Logic, a reclusive cartoonist caller, with Patrice O'Neill offering crude and sexually explicit advice on improving his dating life, using his artwork.  A female caller who worked for a toy company provided a humorous counterpoint.  The hosts and Patrice encouraged Coke Logic to interact with women using ribald jokes.  The segment maintained a highly vulgar and sexually charged tone.

[00:14:00]  I'm just saying like  The reason she's soft spoken  Is because usually  If she's yelling  She has a reason to  Oh  So we don't want to  Is that our goal  To get her to scream at us  No not mine  It would be fun  To get yelled at by her  No it's too early in the morning  Yeah  Come on  Be nice  I met Sharon one time  I was backstage at Ozfest  Of course you were  Of course I had to be  And I was nervous meeting you  Because you know  I guess people who have been  On the other end of business deals  With you that weren't doing  What you liked  Have stories that you don't  You don't F around  And I was kind of nervous 
[00:14:30]  I'm like I don't want to  Say the wrong thing  And piss her off  And you were so nice  Look at the lovely hug  You gave me  You couldn't have enjoyed  That hug  Oh look  Jimmy brought his picture  Yeah she was very sweet  We should tell Sharon  That you're looking at  The biggest Ozzy fan  Of all time  Really?  And I'm sure you've heard  That a lot  But I'm telling you  He's obsessed  He's almost a stalker  No  Almost a stalker  When Ozzy was on our show  He couldn't speak  He was looking forward  To this for so long 
[00:15:00]  And he just turned into  A blithering idiot  Well for the first 10 minutes  I just sat there  And we were at the XM side  And Ozzy's on my right  And Anthony is great  Because he can just  Conduct an interview  And I'm such a  Just a starstruck ass  And Ozzy's talking  And I'm like hey dope  Ozzy is sitting next to you  We at least talked to him  And then I started talking  And he hung for like 45 minutes  And then it worked out  Okay I just kind of  Loosened up  But oh yeah  I was nervous  You were a little nervous  So cute  You turned into a little kid  But Ozzy is so unique  He's so different  Oh yeah 
[00:15:30]  And he's hilarious  Easy to talk to  You guys talk to  You know  A zillion people in a day  But yet when he comes  And everything about him  His body language  Everything  He is so unique  And the best thing was  It was over there  So he could talk  In his inimitable  Ozzy style  Without any restrictions  Yeah no bleepings  What so ever  Wow  Wow  Quite the potty mouth  But he loved it though  Tony Dennis said  That he had a great time  Because he could curse  He didn't have to worry  About like you know 
[00:16:00]  Just dancing around words  He just said what he wanted to say  Jimmy doesn't acknowledge  That another band existed  We try to talk music  On the show  It's all about Black Sabbath  And you try to bring up  God forbid you bring up  Zeppelin or something  Excuse me  He has good taste  Yeah I'm trying to get her  On my side  I'm an idiot  I don't think you have to  Sell her on Ozzy  Yeah good point  I wanted to ask you too  Obviously this really  Irritated me  That there was  At Ozfest  That I loved you  For doing this  Iron Maiden  Like Dickinson  And bad mouthing  Sabbath  I mean was he actually 
[00:16:30]  Bad mouthing the band  Because I know  It got really ugly  Between the two  He was bad  I mean come on  These guys  You know are English  We've you know  We've passed  Cross paths  Over the years  For like 20 odd years  And he came on  We paid them a fortune  To come on  We were you know  Really nice with them  Gave them whatever  They wanted  And every single night  Not Sabbath  But Ozzy  He took pot shots  At Ozzy on stage  And at first  Ozzy and I  Thought it was a joke  So you know 
[00:17:00]  You know how guys  You know  You joke with each other  And we're like  Okay he's joking  And it went on  And went on  And on  And I just thought  Okay carry on  You want to play  You pay  Nice  And so when they got to LA  Which is like you know  Oh LA  And there's 50 odd thousand kids there  And I thought right  Pay back  And so I had  I had like 20 guys in the front  With eggs  Great big jars of peanut butter 
[00:17:30]  Mixed in with dog food  Milk to make it really wet  Everything  And they pelted him  Good  And I thought  You know what kid  Laugh at that  You know  You don't  You don't take somebody's money  And take their stage  And then be discourteous  To me that just doesn't  It just doesn't go  You know  If you've got something to say  About someone you're working with  Say it  Get it over with  Move on  I heard the rest of the band  Was embarrassed too  I mean  They said 
[00:18:00]  I think  I think I asked Tony  One time  And he said  That the rest of the band  Was kind of coming up  Going look  That's not  That's him  The other guys  I must say  Were very very nice  Great guys  You know  But that singer  Has a problem  He has a real big problem  Very big  You know  Inflated ego  And he just  You know  Is discourteous  But he got it back  I was at the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction  I hijacked the press conference  Because these dumb reporters  Are just going to ask  Stupid reporter questions 
[00:18:30]  Oh I know  And I sat in the second row  And my goal was to like  Talk to Sabbath  And ask questions  And get a photo  While I was talking to them  So I stand up  When they come out  And I'm asking questions  And I'm like trying to  Angle and get a picture  And all these dumb reporters  Yelling  Sit down sir  Could you sit down  Could you sit down  And you're like  No I want my picture  They just didn't exist  And it was great  Asking them real fan questions  Yeah  All these idiots  Want to know about  Is the next album  And some stupid bat joke  And they're just  A bunch of scumbags  These you know  I know  Rolling Stone magazine  Type of critic vibe 
[00:19:00]  Really irritated me  And I don't know  Where I'm going with this  I just wanted to tell you  Just showing that you are  Pretty much a stalker  No  I've never done anything unhealthy  I've never showed up  Some place I shouldn't  I don't hang outside  The fence and peek in  It was the greatest photo  You ever got  Because he got the whole band  That was his goal  He set it up for weeks  We had to hear about it  And he got  He planned it perfectly  And it worked out for him  And it's not  Do you know what  It's not that easy  To get them all together  And do a photo with them 
[00:19:30]  You know  It's so rare  That they are all together  At one time  And you know  The one thing  You know  I mean  How great  It's the only band  From that era  That's all still alive  And still can play great  I went back  I snuck back  After the interview  And I talked to Ozzy  For a second  And I'm like  I'd like to get a picture  With the band  And he's like  Sure man  You know  Relaxed he is  But the other band  The band was still signing  And he had to go  So he's walking away  And then I only comes out  And I had met him that day  I'm like  I want to get a picture  So he's like 
[00:20:00]  Hey Ozzy  Let's just do the picture  So it's him  It's Ozzy  It's Tony  It's me  And then it's Geezer  And then Bill  Is just taking his time  And Bill starts walking out  I'm like  Bill hurry up  Come on  Come on  And he runs  Bill runs over  And he looks like  Who are you  Why am I running for you  He just realized  That there's nobody  There's this legendary band  With their trophies  And me  And I'm hustling  Bill Ward along  Come on  Come on  We need to get you  I screamed at him  I'm like  Bill come on  And he just ran  Jimmy has given us  Hours of joy  Over his obsession 
[00:20:30]  With Black Sabbath  And Ozzy  Obsessed  Yeah and he even says  He even says  How much he liked the Ozzy  With the big poofy hair  Back in the day  Back in the day  Even Sharon didn't  Like that period  Listen believe me  I get so much grief  From my kids  When they look at those pictures  And go  Mom what did you do to die  Didn't let him out of the house  Like that  The shot in the dark  The shot in the dark  Yeah  The black painted fingernails  And toenails  Yeah I mean  It was alright  It was  Hey look  It was right after  It was like the hairband vibe 
[00:21:00]  You had to do  What you had to do  Oh by the way  Here is the picture  That Jimmy got that night  Come on  I want to  Look at this  I mean  You want to talk about that  Is that a great shot though  That's fantastic  Is that a beautiful picture  Like what are the odds  You're going to get  In a picture like that  Unless you're  You know  Close to the band  Or stalking them  Or has guns pointed at them  They're all holding  Their trophies  It couldn't be better  The thing is you've got to get it signed  I was going to try that  I actually  When you guys were at the rock and roll  You had the hard rock  Promoting your charity  Of course self-centered ass 
[00:21:30]  I am  I'm not thinking about the charity  I'm not thinking about doing good  I'm like could you get the picture signed  But it was impossible  You are self-centered ass  You're going to have to wait  Until when is it  2008  Until they do their 40th anniversary tour  And then they'll come in and sign it  That's fine  We'll wait  Yeah  We can wait  I blew that up  I have a copy of that on my wall  It's obnoxious  I love watching  Do you know how big I blew it up  I'm embarrassed  I'm 38 years old  Do you see these squares on the wall  Honestly that's how big it is on my wall 
[00:22:00]  I have to bring women over  And explain why a grown man  Bless you  Sharon I hope you understand  He's a very successful comic  He was on Lucky Louie on HBO  His career is going very well  He comes on stage  In front of massive audience  To some Black Sabbath music  Oh yeah  It's all about Sabbath  A national acrobat is the walk  Even though he's wearing a Kiss shirt today  I'm sorry about that  I had to  It would have been too wormy  If I showed up in an Aussie shirt  And pointed  Hi Sharon  See you even thought about that today  I certainly did  My wardrobe  He's always thinking  And I told Sharon when she walked in  I'm reading the book  And I'm not  You know I really want to read it 
[00:22:30]  Because I'm very interested  And it's really  The first thing  The most amazing thing I've learned so far  Is that Aussie is a morning person  I had no idea  He actually gets up early  And enjoys getting up early  You would never actually think that  Like watching  You'd feel like he probably slept all day  It's the weirdest thing  He opens his eyes  And then boom  He's out of bed  He doesn't like you know  Stretch and you know  A little chat  Literally  Up  Eyes open  Gone  You know in the shower  I'm like how do you do that  You know like relax  Five minutes  And then get up  No  Gone  And he's you know 
[00:23:00]  Roaming around  6.37 every day  And it seems already  Like  I have to do that  The book is already getting  It's like  It's really honest  And Sharon when she walked in  We talked about  I love the fact that your show  And the Osbournes  Wasn't surface honest  It wasn't like  Oh we had an argument once  I mean it was  It got into  To you being sick  And it got into Aussies  It got into like  Really heavy like family things  Was there anything  That you guys like revealed  That you kind of wished  You didn't reveal  No  Because I think  That's what makes  This kind of different  You know  Not only was Aussie 
[00:23:30]  The first celebrity  To actually you know  Let cameras into his home  But you know  He's so honest  He's incapable of being  You know  Oh let's set up this idea  And let's set up that  You know  Aussie can't do that  He's incapable of doing that  So everything you saw  Is you know  Natural and organic  And you know  It's pure  And I think that's what  Sets it aside  From everybody else  That's trying to do it  I know you watch  Any of those shows now  And it's like  Oh stop  That's so badly acted 
[00:24:00]  I know  It's like what made you  Think you were an actor  I know  That you can script this out  And make it look legit  You know  It gets embarrassing  With some of them  You kind of get like  You know when you get like  Yeah  You can't watch  Turn it off  If there's other people in the room  You can't look at each other  I get embarrassed  We call that the douche chills  Yeah  Yeah  It's the worst  But he's  You know  We don't regret anything  You can't  Do you miss it though  Do you miss taping the show  And all that  And having all those people around  I miss the family being together 
[00:24:30]  You know  Right before it ended  It was the time that the kids  Were actually you know  Moving out  So it was a huge life change  For Ozzy and I  You know  To have that house  That's odd  That you're really  Like I don't think the viewer  Really put it in that perspective  Like wow  You're watching your kids  Grow up to the point  Where they're ready  To leave the nest  And that's it  You know  And it's really strange  You know  To come in  And you're used to having kids  Coming in and out  All night long  And you know  And then suddenly  There's nothing  And you go home 
[00:25:00]  And there's Ozzy  And I sat  At a big table  Having dinner  And we say  Oh  Let's go have it  On the tray  In the kitchen  And we go back  In the kitchen  And it's us  You know  It's  I mean  It's great  It's just a new chapter  Of your life  You know  It's very different  Yeah  Been a big adjustment  Or  Yeah  Yeah  Oh yeah  You know  I keep going over  To my kids homes  And buying them  Ridiculous things  For the house  Excuse to go there  I must love that  No they don't  It's like  Oh please  Would you stop  If you're smothering me 
[00:25:30]  I'm like  I'm sorry  Is it things that they need  Or just kind of things  That you like  And like  Things I think they need  And I like  And I take it there  And they're like  Thanks mom  Yeah  You know  Like I take over  A big pink  Fluffy cushion  To Jack's house  Thanks mom  You know  As soon as  As soon as I go  It's in like  The cup  And just give it to a girl  Like look at  I got you  I want to ask you  I want to ask you  Something else too  I'm so annoyed  About the book  Come on 
[00:26:00]  No it wasn't  About the book  It was about something  That wasn't the book  I'm so stupid  I love the book though  I'm very happy  I'm very nervous  Talking to Sharon  I just like watching you squirm  On the world  Look at her shoulders  They're like this  After the other day  I'm loving this  I've never seen  Jimmy with his shoulders  Way up like this  All hunched up  He's like all tense  Just talking to my friend Sharon  What's wrong with this  I happen to love her husband  But you know  So what  I like her too  The fact is  This is what bugs me  A lot of people  Don't understand that Sharon  I'm not saying this 
[00:26:30]  Just because you're here  I mean Ozzy's talent  Is responsible for a lot of it  But you're responsible  For  You made Ozzy  You kept him relevant  Through so many  Tough periods of music  Like all through the hair bands  All through grunge  Oh the grunge  Don't remind me of the grunge  Jeez  But he stayed  He's stuck  He did  And Ozfest  How close was it  To getting him  To wear a flannel  Did you think about it  Never  Ever  Ever  You know  They don't do flannel  In black  Right 
[00:27:00]  And you couldn't see Ozzy  In check  You were able to get  His hair poofy  I was just thinking  Maybe a flannel  No  I could never do that  I mean  Can you imagine Ozzy  In short  Those short trousers  And coming in  With a check  The jams on  Yeah  What did you think  Think of the grunge movement  You know  It's better than the hair bands  Better than the hair bands  You know  Love Nirvana  Love Pearl Jam  And then  I can't remember anyone else 
[00:27:30]  Alice in Chains  Alice in Chains  Yeah you're right  Love them  My son's  Favorite band  I mean  We love them  We're trying to get them  On Ozfest next year  Oh with the new  The new singer  No  With the old one  It is  What the hell  Did you think  We're gonna dig him up  Yeah right  They're playing  Philadelphia tonight  I might go down there  And check it out  The electric factory  I'm hearing nothing  But great things  About this new singer  They're really great  Yeah  Hey did you and your dad  I know your dad  Don Arden  Had managed Black Sabbath 
[00:28:00]  And I don't know  If that's how you met  Ozzy or not  But did you guys  I know had a lot of  Conflict over when  You started to manage him  Right  Yeah a lot of  A lot of conflict  Because when I started  A relationship with Ozzy  And my dad knew  That we were gonna  Get married  He knew that  It was time for me  To go  And I would go  And I would take Ozzy  Which means his  Financial  You know  State would be affected  Because he wouldn't  Have Ozzy anymore  And my dad 
[00:28:30]  You know  It's not like  Oh my daughter's  Married  Fantastic  It's like  You know  Stay  I want the money  Don't go  And it was  Everything's about money  Well it was about money  With my father  And did it ever  Like get resolved  Or did you  Did you end everything  On bad terms  No it was horrible  He never saw my children  My mother never saw  My children  My brother  And  But eventually  I heard that my father  Was sick  And so  Five years ago  I  Four  Four or five years ago 
[00:29:00]  I  I  Met with my father  And I take care of him now  He's old  Oh he's still alive  I don't know why  I thought he passed away  Okay  No he's still alive  He's 80  Wow  So things are a little bit better  At least  Well he has old timers  So he doesn't know  Who I am  And I  But I take care of him  You know  You  You  You have to forgive  But you don't forget  You know  You can't  You can't  Go through life  Holding all that  You know  You've got to let it go  Is it tough being  I mean  I've been asked this  A million times 
[00:29:30]  But to be a wife  And a manager  I mean  It's like  I mean  It's just  It's constantly together  It's  Everything is together  Is there any like  Times where you just like  You wish you weren't the manager  I mean obviously  You want to be married  Sure  I mean  Very very tough  Excuse me  Are you watching porn on there  No  Oh I thought she was  Covering herself with that  You know what  She's  She's spilling out her heart  I'm not going to see porn on there  No  Okay  No no no  She's reaching deep for us  And then  She notices that  I might be watching porn 
[00:30:00]  I took down  Any  Anybody  That might have been  Doing anything  These are our listeners  A few of them  And they pop up  They can see us  We can see them  Watch  I'm telling you  It's very interactive  Okay  And they comment  On what's going on  On the show  And ask questions  Things like that  Sorry  No nude  No because  You know  Any other day  You'd be right  It would have been  Some nude girl up there  But  Not today  I'm being respectful  Not today  Going back to your question  It's very hard 
[00:30:30]  At certain times  When you  You know  You want  Your artist  To do something  But you don't want  Your husband to do it  But it's all one  So it's  There were very  Hard times  At certain points  You know  Certain points  When I say in the book  When Ozzy wasn't well  But he had to go on stage  And I made him  And you know  You feel  So bad  You know  What do you do  It's like  Nine o'clock at night  The audience  Have been there all day  There's thousands of kids  And if anyone 
[00:31:00]  Would go on stage  And say  Well actually  You can go home now  Because he's not performing  He's not well  It would have been  Riot  People would get hurt  So you weigh it up  What do you do  What do you do  I don't think you had a choice  You've taken a huge amount  Of heat for that though  Huge  From people  Yeah  That have just said  Oh look  She's you know  Throwing him out on stage  And the poor guy  Didn't feel well  Yeah  And you know  What do you do  Because I've been there  I've done it  We've cancelled shows  On the day  And you know  Kids don't like it 
[00:31:30]  And they've been out  In the sun all day  They've been drinking  And they  You know  They paid  They paid their money  They want to see them  And you know  It gets pretty ugly  Those times  But we don't have to  Do that anymore  Because my husband's well  Was the small stage  A nice switch  I was so irritated  I was away doing gigs  I missed the small stage  Performance  That must have been  A great change  It was amazing  It was so fantastic  Ozzy's going to do it  Again next year  Oh good  Loved  Loved being out there  At like four in the afternoon 
[00:32:00]  And you know  Just he  He was so happy  Doing it  Home by seven o'clock  Oh  Luxury  How disgusted were you  I know  And don't blame me  You were talking about  Cardinal O'Connor  And all these  Devil accusations  And all that stuff  That stuff seems to have  Kind of like faded away  Over the years  Like all that nonsense  Around him  I think  You think it's since the show  That like all those  Dumb rumors  That would circulate  Just kind of like  Eh  Kind of fell by the wayside  And people don't  Yeah I mean  Middle America  People that didn't  Understand the genre  Of music 
[00:32:30]  That Ozzy was into  Didn't understand  And believed  Everything they read  And you know  It's like a Chinese whisper  You know  He bit the head  Off a bat  No actually  He ate  A baby  So you know  It just  You know  Snowballs  And people now  You know  See Ozzy  As he's just  A lovable guy  You know  He's a great guy  And so he sings  About the darker  Side of life  You know  You can't sing  About you know  Happy shiny people 
[00:33:00]  All day  It's boring  Yeah bravo on that  Did you want to  Just smack him  In the head  With that ATV  Accident  I mean like  What are you doing  Do you  Are you a little  More protective  Of him now  And he comes up  With some  Hairbrained idea  That he wants to do  And you just go  Look  What are you doing  No  It  All of that  The bikes  Because he had  A whole collection  Of dirt bikes  And all these  Different things  And the guns  And the that  I'm like  No  No more  Sorry  You're done

[00:34:00]  Wait are they  Cutting his mouth  Yeah we gotta get out of here  We are on a timed thing  Because there's another show  That comes in after us  How dare they  Tell them to go away  And you look beautiful  Absolutely beautiful  Stunning  Thank you Sharon  We're really happy  You came in  Wish you had more time  With us  I'll come back  She'll come back  Sharon Osbourne  Everyone  Thank you Sharon  Hi this is Sharon Osbourne  And you're listening  To the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  It's a mad house

[00:35:30]  By an 18 year old referee  Coach punched the ref  Knocked him unconscious  18 year old  Oh look at that  Did you see  Oh this is ugly  This is just bad  Some parents  Staggled the coach  To keep him away  From the kids  Charges are pending  Against the coach  Man  Yeah  Terrible  Disgusting  And another adjective  Horrible  There you go  Why don't you get  A hold of yourselves  It's not 9-11 footage  It's a bunch of parents  Fighting  Brawling  But she got a little

[00:38:00]  In between innings  With little  Little  Little like  Sandwiches  And snacks  When I was playing  Little league  When I was playing  In the  Little league baseball  If I wanted to drink  I had to suck  My mother's pussy in ass  Holy shit Jimmy  Oh my lord  At least she was there for you  That's right  It's nice  I was a pitcher  When I was a kid  And I was just  Fucking  Catch her now  Power bottom  Are you trying to say  I top from the bottom

[00:39:00]  It was just kind of  Backwards  Forwards  You're gonna add an extra  One billionth of a mile  Per hour to your pitch  With that  I had no  I remember I walked  They had such high hopes  For me as a pitcher  Mr. Ryan  Thought I was gonna be  A great pitcher  Mr. Ryan was a boob  He certainly was an ass  And I didn't do  I did particularly well  In one game  Like against one or two hitters  But then they started me  And I think I walked  Like seven people in a row  And they had to yank me  That no insight asshole  He was awful 
[00:39:30]  Wow  Bofor  Mother's cunt  Bofor  Dying a fire  Just pull me already  Ball  Ball  Come on  Get me out of here  I'm dying here  Best effort  Ball four  Bases are loaded  No outs  How do I get out of this  I could do this  Strike  Yes  I can pull it together  Ball four  What a

[00:40:30]  It's three in one  Let's go to Randy  In Houston  Randy  Hey what's up  Fellas  Hey Randy  I was kind of raised  To hope he was  When you were a kid  And you were playing  Little League  If you wanted a goddamn drink  You had to wait  To the end of the damn  Nine innings  If you were injured  Get out there  And fucking play  That was my dad's stance  Yeah cause my nephew  JD is big into  The baseball there  And I've gone to  A lot of the games  And you know  You see a lot of  A lot of athletes 
[00:41:00]  But you see these moms  And they're just like  Hanging around the dugout  Like handing food  To their kid  In the dugout  JD doesn't get the food  And the juices really  They want to be part of it  For the most part  They want to be part of it  It's all about snacks  And it's just a fun day  Out for everybody  It's not a sport anymore  In some ways  Kids are trained  To be pussies now  I don't know  I gotta say one thing  It's like we're  Kind of knocking that  But it's like  It was funny  The way Oak just said that  Yeah it's just a fun day out  Like yeah I guess 
[00:41:30]  That is kind of  What it's supposed to be  For kids  Like you're having snacks  You're having snacks  And hitting the ball  But the way you said that  Like ah  Little cunts  Just trying to have fun  And enjoy their day  I'm the Bobby Knight  Of the peewee league  Just displaying sportsmanship  Sportsmanship and the like  No it's  Alright  Father should go over there  And punch her in the face  Dude  There's a difference  When you get your friends together  You go to the schoolyard  You hit the ball around  You try to get a game together  Whatever  It's a fun day out  But organized sports  It's  You know 
[00:42:00]  You shouldn't have mommy  Like hanging out  All the dugout  Asking if you want some  You know  Animal crackers  Juicy  And a juice box  My mother never did that stuff  My mother was  Actually  My mother was on the fence  Holding on to it  Shaking it  Going  Swing  Better swing  She was really embarrassing  She'd go  No batter  No batter  No batter  While I was up at the plate  We want a pitcher  Not a belly  That likes to have shit on it  She'd be on the fence  Trying to rally 
[00:42:30]  The other team  Were you easy out guy  Yeah  One point  Easy out  And I would fuck in the works  And be like  I'll show you guys  I'll show you  Swing  Foul tip  Ball goes nowhere  It's not a good foul tip  It's I barely got a piece  And the ball would just like  Limply  Like my cock in adulthood  Just bounce off the plate  And technically  It wasn't a fucking miss  And the coach would go  Good swing Jimmy  Just try to encourage me  Good swing  Good swing  Good piece of the ball 
[00:43:00]  Yeah  And it wasn't a good piece of the ball  Good eye  No  That's how bad I was  I would take solace in my outs  Hey when you were walking to the plate  Did the pitcher turn around  And give the sign of everyone moving  Everyone come on in  Move in everyone  No closer  Closer  The umpire would do that  The fucking  They would actually pick the fences up  And move them in  Center fielder's now playing second base  Moving  That was awful  I told you the time that I fucking  I was up at the plate  And I hit a little dribble or foul  Up the first baseline 
[00:43:30]  And it was just foul  And I stood there limply  And they're all yelling  Run  Run it out  And I was like  But the ball's foul  Run it out  And I just stood there  And then it went fair  Oh no  And as the guy picked it up  I started running  And I got three feet  I got  I got  I got  I got  I got  I got three feet from home plate  Oh hold on a second  Let me just get the phone here  Because you know  People who don't know me  Are you the worst  Yeah I uh  That is funny  I got three feet away from home plate 
[00:44:00]  And they threw me out  And I had to turn around  And walk back to the dugout  Old chubby  My fucking uniform was untucked  Would you have made it  If you started running  Right when you hit  Oh I might have  If I just  Yeah  Yeah if you actually  Did what you were supposed to do  Or I would have at least  Looked like I was running it out  But I stood there limply  While they all screamed  Run  Run it out  No it's foul  And I just stood there  Like with my arms out  Like what  I don't want to run it out  It's a foul ball  A little panicky Pete  When it takes that turn  And it hit the grass 
[00:44:30]  And it went  Right back in  And as the guy picked it up  I just started hustling it out  Like the miracle was going to come  You hit a  You hit a frunkus  The ball went  Frunkus  Oh what an ass  God that's funny  I remember one game  I was so bad  They moved me from position to position  I started out in right field  And they moved me in a third  Oh I was awful  And some kid tried to steal third  And they threw it to me  And the ball just like  My glove stood there  And the ball just went left of my glove 
[00:45:00]  And he ran home  Oh what a fucking  Impotent mess I was  There are certain people that you know  Wherever they are positioned  The second he has to come into play  It's like  Because it's happening so fast  But your mind is working real quick  And you're like  Oh we're fucked  Oh we're fucked  And there goes the ball  Of the throw  And he fucking missed it  One year  I actually wasn't the worst hitter  I would do okay  And this is probably  What am I  I mean I'm 38  And this was probably 
[00:45:30]  When I was 13  25 years ago  And I still remember  My dad overheard  Some black kid on the team  Complimenting me  And he told me about it  The kid's name was  Andy Blocker  Andy Blocker  And he said  That Jimmy's one of the better hitters  On this team  And my dad reported that to me  And I never forgot it  Nice  I was one of the better hitters  On that team  And I wasn't  Very nice of that  Yes it was me  And Rick Allen  And Christopher Reeve  Were the three hitters  And I was one of the better ones  Behind only those two  I want to start a new bit  Clean up hitter  You gotta clean up 
[00:46:00]  Christopher Reeve's shit  And Heather Mills  Where she would just  Put pine tar on her thigh  And swing it  Oh my god  I don't know why  That makes sense  She only has one leg  That makes more sense  If you have two  Mike and Jerry  Hey what's up guys  Hey  First at bat  Peewee  Like the first year  You could play baseball  Hit right in the head  By a pitch  I must have stood  A foot and a half  Away from the plate  Every time I went to bat  After that  I could not  Get into it after that 
[00:46:30]  Scared you away  Alright  Yeah I never liked that  Being brushed back shit  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Alright Anthony  Had a very good observation  This pal talk  Is taking over  This radio program  This radio show  Used to be just  A four hour experience  Now it's just  Around the clock  Yep  The Opie and Anthony  Experience continues  Around the clock  When the show ends  You can go on pal talk  Or numerous message boards  Or anything  And it continues  The relationship  Between the listeners  And the program  Continues  And they're hanging out 
[00:47:00]  At my brother's place  Yeah  It's like a whole thing  That's going on  They have a hangout  Online  Hangout  If they want to be  Part of the real world  But what I'm getting at here  You notice that  Stalker Patty  Has a pal talk camera  I'm looking  I see Stalker Patty  Up there  On the corner  Yeah  Off center  Her whole place  Is a corner  I just looked at it  It's awful  It's horrid  It's a horrid  Little cracker box  She lives in  And yeah  Patty  Has a camera  And an account  And if you notice 
[00:47:30]  She's got  A green account  Which means that  That's the one  That you pay  Full price for  You get all of the  Benefits of being  A full  Paid  Member  Of pal talk  And a camera  Now recently  We had  Our listeners  Had put a charity  Together  Because Patty  Was going to be  Kicked out of her  Apartment  She was back  She had a bunch  Of back  Payment  To make  On the rent  And the listeners  Came up with a bunch  Of cash  And gave her  Money  Which we made her 
[00:48:00]  Earn  By crawling on her  Hands and knees  Naked  Through mousetraps  Blindfolded  Until she found  The checks  It was fabulous  So she got  The money  And apparently  Spent a little bit  Of it  I see  At least  On a camera  And an account  I think she uses  Us to be  Quite frank  Look at her  Now she's  Holding up her  Cat  She's got her  Cat in there  But I think  Maybe misappropriation 
[00:48:30]  Of funds  That's right  I think perhaps  We should  Sue to get it  Back now  Let's contact  The SEC  And we can  Have the money  Taken away  Please sue Patty  Someone go and  Confiscate her camera  Oh please sue her  That would be  The greatest story  Why are you  Suing me  A charitable event  To raise money  For her  And she's buying  Luxury items  That's right  It's a luxury item  Pal talk  It certainly is  She's living high

[01:03:00]  Here's  Some  Of  The  Fine  Audio  Nothing  Yeah, just to set up.  So the old dude is in the house, and all of a sudden now Dateline jumps into the room.  It's great.  They have a girl in there that could sound like a young boy or a young girl.  Right.  Yeah, and she gets them to come through the back door of the house, of course.  And there's the Dateline guy waiting for them.  Hold on a second.  Can we go to Jay, Chocolate City?  Jay, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to let all the new listeners know what a lucky fella little Jimmy is. 
[01:03:30]  He has now escaped Perlin City Park, Central Park, two times.  He had that wall almost fall on him, fella.  You had a wall almost fall on you?  Yeah, when he was getting that knob job by that hooker, that retaining wall, about a year ago.  What?  All right, car crash, punch it out.  He can't crash and then punch out.  I have no idea what that story is about.  Hold on, Nathaniel, did Danny just send you in? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, thank you.  All right, here we go.  So the old dude is in the house and now Dateline pops into the room to give him the bad news.  What you up to today?  Nothing.  Call.  Talk with the gentleman.  I have a place that I have for sales.  Oh, you're selling a house.  Uh-huh.  I see.  And he was interested.  Well, here's what doesn't make sense about that.  How is a 13-year-old going to afford to buy your home?  Well, I didn't know how old he was. 
[01:04:30]  I didn't ask.  Stopped to ask his age.  Ah.  Well, Chuck, the only problem with that story is, is that I have the transcripts of your conversation with Luke.  Dread.  What are you looking for?  I could be your grandpa.  Into young boys your age.  Love to cuddle with them.  Caress their body.  Work my...  And it goes on from there.  Ah.  Ah.  Work my...  I'm disgusted.  Let's play match game.  Work my...  Hairless cock. 
[01:05:00]  Can I say how much I hate this reporter's voice?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, so you're funny.  Work my...  Blank.  He has too much joy in his soul that he's doing this job.  A 13-year-old boy.  Charles Nelson Reilly, work my butthole.  Ow.  Ow.  I don't know.  Ow.  All right, we have more. 
[01:05:30]  Work my prostate like a speed bag.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Could you choke me with my ascot till I almost pass out?  Give me some poppers.  Ow.  Ow.  I like a guy that looks like Brett Summers.  Ow.  Ow.  Ah, too good.  All right, we got more audio of the really old dude.  Finally, he decides to tell the truth, and he actually admits that he might have had sex  with the boy. 
[01:06:00]  But if he would have consented to having sex, what would have happened?  I'd be very hesitant at first.  If he continued, then possibly we would have had it.  Possibly you would have had sex with a 13-year-old boy.  If, you know, I felt uncomfortable, and I felt that he was, you know, not fit or anything,  I would have walked away.  Not fit?  How can a 13-year-old boy be fit to have sex with a 65-year-old man?  I mean, fat.  Don't you see a tissue there?  Well, I see nothing wrong with cuddling and caressing. 
[01:06:30]  Then he talks about a book he reads that fills him with fantasies.  It deals with younger, older, you know, father, son.  Father, son?  Oh, you're talking about fathers having sex with their sons, grandfathers having sex with  their grandkids.  You know, doctors with their patients, with the young patients, employees with their young  patients.  You talk about this like it's some sort of hobby, building train sets.  That's not what we're talking about here.  It's a book that I read, and I fantasize. 
[01:07:00]  Wow.  Way to not give out the title.  Is that on Oprah's list?  Oprah's book.  I don't think so.  I think that guy probably, I think his lawyer probably would have told him to shut up.  I think that was a bad thing he did there legally for his case.  I fantasize about.  I'm a young boy. 
[01:07:30]  A young manicotti boy came up with a baseball bat.  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.  He's on Ed Norton's baseball team.  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.  The book's called A Million.  Stickball, Norton.  Pull the diaper off.  Grandpa will get it.  The book is called A Million Little Asses.  What up?  All right.  Here we go.  Some more audio from the old dude.  Anybody know?  Yeah, come on in.  Here's a man with the screen name Guy from Mars, 83, who seems to think it's perfectly legal for an adult to talk online to a 13-year-old about meeting for sex. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, Guy from Mars.  It's my favorite book.  Men are from Mars.  Kids are from Sesame Street.  I think this is a new dude, huh?  Yeah.  This is a new guy.  I love him.  Anybody know him?  Yeah, come on in.  Here's a man with the screen name Guy from Mars, 83, who seems to think it's perfectly legal for an adult to talk online to a 13-year-old about meeting for sex.  How are you?  Imagine the poor guy with the screen name Guy from Mars, 82. 
[01:08:30]  Like, I've got to change my whole fucking screen name now.  He's just a fan of astronomy.  That's all, you know.  Yeah, Guy from Mars, you know.  Gets on with other geeks and talks about stars.  Hey, do you hear about the face on Mars?  It isn't really a face.  Right.  Looking from another.  What?  I'm not a pervert.  What the fuck?  No, that's the other.  One more up.  They found a rock with oxygen in it.  Yeah, a bunch of guys.  Guy from Mars, 80.  Chat with him.  Yeah.  Guy from Venus. 
[01:09:00]  They're having another problem with him because he wants to talk about Venus.  And they're like, it's too close to the sun.  Have life, you dope.  Ah, that's a very good point.  ...to a 13-year-old about meeting for sex.  Hey, how are you?  What are you going to say?  And then show up at her house.  He's 23-year-old Inderjeet Singh.  Oh, boy.  Well, you can talk.  You can converse, but it doesn't mean I'm going to do it, right?  Unless I do it.  Unless you catch me on point doing it. 
[01:09:30]  Ah, well.  So you say I would have to catch you having sex with a 13-year-old girl before you could get in trouble.  Maybe in India.  Before you can put me against the law.  It is against the law.  So you're a lawyer?  I'm not a lawyer.  Oh.  Well, you sound pretty familiar with the law.  Well, I'm pretty much into academics, so...  You're into academics.  Well, let me correct you a little bit on how the law works.  Okay.  Go ahead and turn around for me.  Please let me go because...  Let you go.  Let you go why?  I haven't done any other crime in the past. 
[01:10:00]  I'm very clean.  This is the first time?  Yes.  Okay.  Please believe me.  Well, I don't know.  I love the please let me go.  Like, what makes a person say that?  Is it that last-ditch effort?  Is it just the nothing?  Because can you possibly think they're going to go, he said it.  All right.  I guess we got it.  They're not letting you go.  We should talk to the cops today because no matter what kind of crime you commit, everyone does that. 
[01:10:30]  Please.  Please.  Come on, man.  Just let me go and I'll...  It's the first time.  I'll never do it again.  All right.  All right, you wacky bastard.  You can go.  Let's talk to the cops.  I don't think it's ever happened.  And it's...  The cops always ask.  You make a good point.  Just put your hands behind your back.  You got to look.  You got to step out of the moment.  You're not there anymore.  Look ahead and see what you're going to do once you get to lock up.  To get out of that situation.  Because once they're doing it, just put your hands behind your back and cooperate. 
[01:11:00]  Don't talk to them.  Don't do anything.  Just go to jail.  And then decide how you're going to get out of it.  Because asking, begging, talking, saying stuff, it will all just work against you.  See, it's like the weird...  You're like an animal.  Like, one minute you're relaxed and, like, you're ready to have sex.  And the next minute you're a moose sitting in a lady's car.  Your head's sticking out the windshield.  You just can't believe it's happening.  So you're like, I panic.  That's like almost like...  That's stripped of all societal dignity. 
[01:11:30]  Stripped of all messages.  That's just basic.  That's what you...  That's the core of what you want to say.  Emotionally, it's one extreme to the other, too.  I mean, solid.  One extreme to the other.  You're whipped up into this frenzy of sex that, you know, you think you're going to have this best fetish perverted sex you're ever going to have.  And then a couple of seconds later, you're being arrested.  Yeah.  Yikes.  Can you please just let me go? 
[01:12:00]  No.  Let me talk about it with the guys over here.  That would be really funny.  Look, dude.  It's your first time?  Really?  Because then they'd be begging.  Yeah, yeah.  It's my...  Okay, shh, shh.  No cops do that just to make their day a little more fun.  I'm going to talk with my sergeant over here because since it is your first time...  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.  And then talk and go, dude, I'm pulling the old.  This guy thinks he's getting old.  Look at it.  Now, let's look over at him.  Look at his face.  How sorry he looks.  And then they all nod yes and you take the handcuff keys out.  Take the cuff keys out, start walking over to him, and then just lock the cuffs so they 
[01:12:30]  don't move.  No, sorry.  Got to take you in, asshole.  Yeah.  All right.  We got more audio from the Dateline Internet Predators episode three.  This guy is trying to be normal.  That's his screen name.  Would you come on over here and have a seat, please?  How are you doing?  Good.  How are you?  All right.  Don't be fooled.  And until you hear more about him, he's a convicted felon.  What's going on?  I'm just meeting a friend that I met on the Internet.  Really?  He's 48-year-old Daniel Allen, screen name trying to be normal. 
[01:13:00]  Online, he promised to teach a girl who said she was 13 different sexual positions and show  her what a man really likes, not sex.  I don't know how old.  That's why I'm here.  I'm just curious.  You're just curious?  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't bring any booze with me.  I didn't absolutely curiosity.  Leave your dick at home?  Because I think that's the important part of this whole thing.  Not the booze or the presents.  It's your dick.  Unless you left that at home, please see the man in blue. 
[01:13:30]  His chat log suggests something else.  I will come to you and we will get a place for passionate love.  What does that sound like to you?  Good point.  He says, oh my God, how cool.  And then you say, wow, 13, am I too old?  Nah, am I too young?  I hate to say this, but you're not.  Why do you hate to say that?  Because it's like I'm some old pervert, but girls your age are so much more fun. 
[01:14:00]  Let me say this.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I'd have conversations like this with people that turn out to be guys more than half the time.  Lucky fella.  But half the time they're not.  Half the time, yeah.  Good point.  Tell that to the judge.  He'll be very understanding.  Dope.  You know, a lot of times I fuck kids.  It turns out they're older men, your honor.  Bye.  I can empathize.  Half the time, they're not even kids.  And the other half the time, they're infants.  You can't win. 
[01:14:30]  Don't you see something inappropriate about that?  Well, I mean, maybe so, but I had my big doubts that she was 13.  Then he admits this isn't his first time.  You visited people who you met online who said they were 13 before?  Well, yeah, 13 or 15.  So it's not the first time you've done this?  Well, no.  Wait a minute. 
[01:15:00]  I've never met a 13-year-old girl from offline.  Well, what I'm trying to say.  Did you ever go meet somebody who said they were 13 online?  Um, no, not 13.  16 in my area, and it was a guy who had a big laugh on me.  He's raising the age 45.  Grandfatherly.  And then it gets ugly.  You see how it looks.  I see how it looks.  You're absolutely right. 
[01:15:30]  You know, I mean, you're right.  Now it was time to tell him who I am.  I am Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC, and we're doing a story on Computer Predators.  Ah, well, you better, I'll shove that camera down his throat.  I don't think you're going to want to do that.  Why is that?  I don't think you'll want to do it.  Now, we can't keep you here.  If you want to say anything else to us, we'd love to hear it.  You're free to leave, obviously, if you want to go.  Okay, but can I talk to you outside?  No, I can't have the cameras turned off at this point.  I can't there. 
[01:16:00]  Well, then I'd like to say that pretty much I think you have it all wrong.  Pretty much.  But your point's well taken.  Hi, guys.  Pretty weird.  Cut.  I love the you're free to go part.  You're free to go for 10 feet, and then you will be arrested.  That's him just being a pussy.  Yeah.  I can't turn the cameras off at this point.  You're free to go, because if he says there's, you know, cops in the area, then all hell's  going to break loose, and he doesn't want to deal with that.  I then read the transcript of the conversation that was about Graphic Slough. 
[01:16:30]  God, his voice.  It's mind-boggling what a parody of a reporter he is.  Yep.  Just smarmy.  Sex.  Who talks like that?  I would like to meet you with you, and cuddle, and touch each other.  Really?  What is going through your mind when you're writing this kind of...  Why is it going to hurt the story if he goes, are you here to meet a minor for sex? 
[01:17:00]  Are people going to go, I don't, that's not official.  Yeah.  Who is this guy?  Hello, please take a seat.  Why are you talking like that?  Right.  That's what I'd say.  Forget about me fucking children.  Do a story on why you talk like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hairless asses get me high.  But your voice, sir, it has to be fixed.  What is that?  Kevin the cop, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Long time, long time.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Kev.  Anthony, are you sure you weren't on the job? 
[01:17:30]  Why?  What's that, fella?  Because that whole thing with the handcuff keys is so fucking accurate.  You do that?  Oh, my God.  I just thought it would be a hysterical joke.  That is so fucking accurate.  I swear to God.  I'm a highway cop out on the island.  I got a civilian complaint one time for laughing so hard at you motherfuckers.  But the person thought I was laughing at them in their rearview mirror and wrote a letter.  Oh, no kidding.  So what do you do?  We know the cops very well.  You go to arrest them and they beg? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, all the time.  Yeah.  Everybody thinks it's just like, okay, please.  Please.  Come on, God.  Give me a break.  Have you ever let anybody go?  When you got to lock somebody up, you got to lock them up.  I mean, there's so much liability involved.  Yeah.  But I let people go on the speeders all the time.  Right.  Speed, really?  I'm mostly just a speed guy.  Are you Suffolk or Nassau?  I'm in Nassau.  That's all I can say. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Watch out for anything.  Nassau, guys.  I'll tell you, the Nassau Highway Patrol are some tough guys, man.  They are really tough to get out of a ticket with.  Well, you got to understand something.  The precinct cops, it's a summons.  You know, you got to make some numbers and stuff like that.  They got to be decent summonses.  But most of the time, you got some leeway back and forth.  The reason why there are highway cops in the first place is because someone has to give  the tickets and not give a break. 
[01:19:00]  That's why they're there.  Yeah.  You get pulled over by highway, you're getting a ticket.  Yeah.  No matter what.  That's their job.  Yeah.  If they start not giving out tickets, then what are they doing?  Sit around.  It's like Anthony said that Long Island cops don't have the balls to give him a ticket.  Hey, I didn't say that.  I love the Long Island cops.  No, you were just saying yesterday on the show, Anthony.  That's an escalate and a CRX, right?  Those brilliant cops on Long Island have to shovel up more drunken teens every weekend  than anywhere else in the country.  No, but it was like you say. 
[01:19:30]  Anthony says he doesn't even really like to slow down.  He'll just poke his lips by the window and go, I'm Anthony from the radio.  And they scatle back to the car like girls.  That's what Ed says.  At this point, I don't even have time to meet you and give you autographs.  You know, I can laugh along with what Jimmy and Opie are saying  because I am such a strong supporter of the police department that it comes off as a joke  because everyone knows that.  We know that, and I hear you talking guns and stuff like that.  What do you got?  What do you think?  Get you down here to our range to shoot a little bit. 
[01:20:00]  What do you guys think of Swazi?  Well, I don't work for Swazi, thank God.  No, but he's running, and he wants to cut funding to the Nassau cops.  Well, he's been cutting the Nassau cops ever since then.  I say fuck Swazi.  Well, I agree.  Pay the cops what they deserve.  You see what this guy found out.  One million dollars apiece.  I'll bet you'd like him if his last name was Swistica.  Swazi.  All right, thanks, Jerry. 
[01:20:30]  So glad to be finally on satellite with you guys.  Love every minute of it.  Laugh too hard during the day and get in trouble.  All right, thanks, buddy.  Bye, mister.  All right.  All the best.  All right, cool.  Yeah, we love the cops.  Absolutely.  John in Texas, what's going on?  Thankless job.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  That's part of this job is when we go in the middle of the night.  I'm a federal marshal, and we wake these guys up to pick them up,  and they look at you and say, hey, how you doing?  And they don't know where we're coming from. 
[01:21:00]  Especially after we've just kicked in their door.  Hey, what's up, man?  What are you here for?  I didn't do anything.  We have a breaker bar that we go in the door, and on the side of it says,  may I come in, please?  That's funny.  Very good.  Texas federal marshal.  Thank you, John.  Tough guy, man.  That is really funny.  Hey, folks, this is Adam West from Family Guy and other things that you know about.  You're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:21:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, we were going to try to get to this earlier.  Fox 5 story on negative political ads.  This will lead into the political ads about The Opie and Anthony Show, and then we're  going to get out of here so you guys can catch a flight.  How's that sound?  Sounds good.  I like it.  They say politics is a dirty business, and judging by some recent campaign ads, it's  never been dirtier. 
[01:22:00]  Bada bing.  We're in it.  But deep.  And worse, this guy Tom Kane, he wants to clean things up.  He even cuts taxes.  Hey, where's our take in that?  They've reached a new low in smear campaigning.  It's just, you know, and I disagree with totally.  I think they should do something.  I think it shouldn't be allowed.  The minute you see them, you almost feel like one's just trying to downplay the other  person, so you're not really focusing on what they're saying.  It's just terrible campaign tactics these days just to get votes.  Often, political action committees, independent of any candidate, run the nastiest ads, like 
[01:22:30]  the anti-Bob Menendez Sopranos spoof.  But listen to this Senate campaign ad in Tennessee, where Democrat Harold Ford is mocked.  I met Harold at the Playboy party.  We took money from porn movie producers.  I mean, who hasn't?  Harold, call me.  Pretty lowbrow stuff, and the ad directly from the Republican National Committee, one  the GOP's own candidate thinks is over the top. 
[01:23:00]  We think the ad is tacky.  We think it's not senatorial.  We think it has no place in this race.  There you go.  See, here's what the politicians do, which is, it amazes me.  They put out these ads that are so despicable and so negative, and just mudslinging.  Then they get on and say how horrible it is that that ad is running, and it shouldn't  be running.  Well, then have it taken off.  Should it be called mudslinging at this point?  It's more than that.  It's cum-slinging.  This is cum-slinging. 
[01:23:30]  They're cum-slinging.  Right in your face.  And shit-slinging.  Right.  The way Migs threw it, right at your mouth.  We can't get enough of it this year, though.  Bob Menendez said, I can smell your cunt.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Who's his opponent?  The guy we love?  Ron Kine.  Ron.  Ron Kine.  Ron.  See?  It makes you remember his name. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's wrong.  That ad does nothing but make you remember the candidate's name.  Ron Kine voted to tuck your dick between your legs and kill a senator's daughter in a well.  I love those ads.  So the listeners threw together some ads.  We're actually, the call is out to the listeners.  Put together negative campaign ads for people on the show.  And we got three that are worth playing today.  Make sure you send them in to Steve or Danny. 
[01:24:30]  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  We got a couple examples that are working pretty good.  Also, I think the info is up on opianthony.com.  Here's the first Opie and Anthony political ad.  Anthony Cumia has a very big secret.  Do you really want your favorite radio host to be someone who aligns themselves with Nazi Germany? 
[01:25:00]  Anthony Cumia admitted this himself.  I'm into Nazis.  Let's hear that again.  I'm into Nazis.  And one more damning time.  I'm into Nazis.  Paid for by the friends of Billy Burr.  When did I yell, I'm into Nazis?  When haven't you?  Right.  During Schindler's List?  Now they can just clip, when did I yell? 
[01:25:30]  Right.  And you'll have another, I'm into Nazis.  There you go.  Oh, there it is again.  Oh, Jimmy.  So there's the first one.  Very good.  I don't say things that are going to damage my political career.  No.  Like, you'd never hear me saying, yeah, my name's Jim and I suck cum.  You know, a listener, a listener, Jim, might take that clip now and twist it around and use it against you.  You got to be careful because there are guys that will go, yeah, give me ten bucks. 
[01:26:00]  I'll let you fuck my mother's mouth while she sleeps.  People might use that in an ad that you're trying to take money.  With what you're saying on the show.  And sell it off your mom like that.  Oh, I don't know.  You got to watch.  But you can't say things like that.  Like, use me as a cum dumpster.  You know, because people will use it.  See, we disguise your voice like that.  Oh, through the almond filter.  Nobody knows who you are anymore.  Now I can be whoever I want.  Go ahead.  I dare you to isolate this.  Give me a load, I'll swallow. 
[01:26:30]  Here's the next Opie and Anthony.  I did a lot of gay references today, by the way.  I apologize.  Go ahead.  Opie and Anthony show political ad.  Martini Steve is incapable of expressing emotion.  Why not?  Martini Steve has no feelings.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Time and again, Martini Steve has proven that he doesn't have what it takes to be an actor.  James Norton has a track record of successful, long-running television series like Tough 
[01:27:00]  Crowd with Colin Quinn and HBO's Lucky Moon.  James Norton has what it takes.  Please hire him.  Message paid for by MBSD Entertainment and David Steinberg.  Well, that's not bad.  That's Tom S. in Boston.  The first one, by the way, about Anthony was Jared in Boston.  Could have used some of the clips, though, that you had there.  But I wouldn't come on these airwaves and say things like, the Amber Alert system should 
[01:27:30]  be called the Tattletail Alert System.  Yeah, I agree.  You got to be careful what you say.  Because a friend of mine once said, I dominate blacks because that's what I do.  And that could come back to haunt him.  You know?  You got to be careful.  Oh, but you're not kidding from your lips to God's ears.  You got to be careful. 
[01:28:00]  You got to be careful and say things like, why can't we bring back whites and colored  water fountains?  Or things that you don't mean.  Oh, my God.  Well, see, I would never say something like that because it could be taken out of context  and used against you.  How about take two on that, though, is what I'm getting at.  No, I like how nervous I sounded saying it.  You were clipped.  You put the wrong tense in.  White and black.  And colored.  Black only.  I'm very sleepy.  It is sick.  And I have a flight into goddamn Denver. 
[01:28:30]  But you're as sweet as the day is long.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  By the way, David Steinberg is my manager.  I was watching Seinfeld the other night.  Like, fucking Jerry and Jason Alexander are peeking around at the Friars Club.  They go, oh, there's David Steinberg.  And he goes, the comedian?  No, the manager.  Yeah.  And then they go, like, they're all disappointed.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be.  Finally, the last political ad for the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the last one for today.  We hope to get a lot more by Monday.  Before you head to the polls this November, Steve C. would like you to know a few things 
[01:29:00]  about his opponent, Anthony Cumia.  Did you know that Anthony Cumia doesn't like black people?  In fact, he lives in one of the whitest neighborhoods in greater New York City.  And though he may be surrounded by Jews, it's a known fact that Anthony Cumia is a Nazi.  And during a recent skit on the Opie and Anthony program, Anthony played the part of Senator Mark Foley.  Kid toucher, you decide. 
[01:29:30]  Steve C. speaks with perfect enunciation and inflection.  Steve C. has never had a girlfriend placed in a loony bin.  Steve C. cares about the environment.  He drives a hybrid, not some flashy Mustang.  Steve C. cares about the environment because he lives in the environment. 
[01:30:00]  Grr.  Paid for by the World Wildlife Fund, Steve Irwin Treasurer.  That's the one to beat right there.  That's a good one, man.  That's the bow.  We just want some clips.  If they have clips, we would love to get clips in there of the show.  Yeah.  It's always so funny when they're out of context.  That guy had the music down, though.  That whole ominous music where you're talking about the opponent.  And then the very patriotic Steve music.  Steve.  I live in the environment.  Grr.  Grr. 
[01:30:30]  Very good, guys.  That was John in Hartford.  Very good, John.  I have a feeling he might be in radio.  Yeah, that was very funny.  His voice is a radio voice.  Yeah.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Story of the day.  Sorry for that interruption there.  This is great.  Listen in.  We're going to begin with an attack on Long Island, and it is, frankly, beyond shocking.  A developmentally disabled man, a bowling alley worker, viciously attacked by two teenagers,  sexually abused with a plumber's snake. 
[01:31:00]  The two teenagers are now charged.  Who would do this and why?  It happened to the bowling alley in Shirley.  Wouldn't.  And why not?  That's what I would do to the reporter.  Jim Dolan is for us tonight.  Jim.  Bill, first, a bit of a warning.  There just is no way to tell this horrible thing.  Oh, that's great.  He's got to warn them.  These dopes.  Bit of a warning.  By the way, I'm fucking, we're speechless here.  Wouldn't he put his a bit of a warning?  There's no way to tell this without laughter.  Make him believe they're getting something done. 
[01:31:30]  You're kidding me.  There you go.  That's a bit of a warning.  Horrible, depraved story without being more graphic than any of us would like to be.  Keep in mind that the victim in this case is a 21-year-old developmentally disabled man  described here at the bowling alley by people as friendly and innocent.  He is a maintenance worker who people here say would never hurt anyone.  But on Sunday night, according to police, he was followed into the men's room by two men,  one of whom held him down, and the other one sexually assaulted him with a plumber's tool. 
[01:32:00]  I don't want any story about me, no part of any story about me to be described by people at the bowling alley as...  There is a great line here in the post where it says,  they're talking about the fallen maintenance employee of AMF Shirley Lanes into the bathroom.  He was a Shirley Lanes employee. 
[01:32:30]  Shirley Lanes.  Shirley, your asshole can't be sore.  And it says, as one teen held the victim down, the other forced the plumbing snake inside him and spun it several times.  Wow.  The man suffered severe pain, bleeding, and internal injuries.  Wow.  See those things?  And a little bit of...  He's a little ashamed, too, probably.  He's a little embarrassed.  He's a little embarrassed.  I don't care how developmentally challenged you are, that part of you is not...  I may be retarded, but it's just kind of a drag.  I really don't think this is right. 
[01:33:00]  You ever think what these guys do right after a crazy act like that before the cops discover what happened?  Like, ha-ha, and then throw the snake down.  And then what's the...  Why do we, uh...  Shit.  Did we just do that?  Yeah, did we just do that?  Yeah.  Did I just hold him down while you shoved that plumber snake up his ass?  Dude, why do we do this?  Did we?  Dude.  But how did they come to it?  Like, did one guy...  Well, that's what I wanted to...  Because you look at the picture, they're like these kids. 
[01:33:30]  I get that you're, you know, you're a teenager, you're bored.  Yeah.  But how did he, you know...  Hey, my dad's got a plumber snake.  You know that retarded guy at the pool?  Why don't we get him in the bathroom, you hold him, and I'll snake it up his ass, and then, you know...  Spin it.  We'll do ten frames.  Like, what the fuck?  Got any quarters?  I want to play Miss Pac-Man.  Hey, uh, Jim in Jersey.  Jim!  Yo, I got a pat from Moon Hockey Line.  Okay.  I guess they gave him the old 7-10 split.  Yeah, that is a pat from Moon Hockey Line. 
[01:34:00]  Devoid of humor.  Devoid of humor.  Oh.  There you go.  There's more to this story here.  Of course there is.  Oh, the reporter goes to the address of one of the suspects.  Oh, that's good.  At the address police sources give for one of those charged, nobody seemed to know Steven Rodriguez.  You know Mr. Rodriguez?  No.  Not at all?  No.  No.  No, not live here.  No.  No.  Oh, that takes balls.  Going to the house.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Or a fucking bad job.  Or it might have a fetish.  That'd be great.  They'd grab the reporter, hold him down and snake his ass.  I'll give you an exclusive.  My ass was snaked as I tried to find Mr. Rodriguez.  It seems this more to meet the eye.  Yeah.  This story didn't end here.  No.  It ended in my anus.  And it goes on still.  I'm Ernie and Astis reporting from my bed at Columbia Presbyterian.  On my stomach.  At least I'm not a retard working at the bowling alley. 
[01:35:00]  Otherwise, in every other way.  Chris from Oklahoma City, they pull out the snake and there's just pennies and gum stuck  to it.  Pennies and gum?  Jesus.  We're supposed to be sad here, guys.  Oh, yes.  Come on.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that they were convinced there was something in his ass valuable or that they lost.  Oh, yeah.  And they're just trying to help a guy out.  I got to hear this guy again. 
[01:35:30]  Nah.  At the address police sources give for one of those charged, nobody seemed to know Stephen  Rodriguez.  You know Mr. Rodriguez?  No.  Not at all?  No.  Police gave this address as where he lives.  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't live here.  I'm just sitting in my system.  What a shitty reporter.  What a great family.  No one seemed to know.  I asked one man who had no reason to know.  Who are you?  I'm just a plumber.  I lost a tool here. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I'm looking for my snake.  Somebody stole my snake.  I left it here.  Jurassic is where he lives.  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't live here.  I'm just visiting my sister.  Does your sister know Mr. Rodriguez?  I have no idea.  Does Mr. Rodriguez live here?  I just got here from Florida.  I couldn't help you, dude.  And it's little wonder nobody admits knowing him.  He is now charged in one of the most holistic...  He's not admitting it.  He's not admitting it.  He's heartless, you fucking adult.  Not admitting it.  The guy instantly just accused him of lying. 
[01:36:30]  And this lying sack of shit.  Do you still have to use...  No wonder.  Do you still have to use the news voice in a story like this?  Yeah, I know.  No one seems to know.  It's no wonder no one's saying he lives here.  Listen to the reporter's voice.  Rodriguez live here?  I just got here from Florida.  I couldn't help you, dude.  And it's little wonder nobody admits knowing him.  He is now charged in one of the most horrific, one of the most heartless crimes in memory.  I don't know about heartless. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I think that took a lot of heart.  One hold him down, one does it, and then they switch off.  Team effort?  Yeah, exactly.  Did he switch off your turn?  Yeah, come on, man.  I'm sick of holding him.  How does that play out?  I thought retards were strong.  What a fucking docile nothing this guy was.  21.  21 years old, too.  Yeah.  He was of age, at least.  Yeah, at least it wasn't.  Yeah, at least it wasn't.  Now they can claim it was consensual.  We didn't know.  He said, er.  Okay, I love you.  Hey, Anthony, don't we have audio of the attack? 
[01:37:30]  Oh, I think we might.  We have an exclusive on our show.  Actually, you know, it wasn't that bad for him.  Right.  It sounds like a horrific thing to happen to somebody, but he actually worked there.  He used to set the pins with his asshole.  Yeah.  So it really didn't hurt him that much as I looked for the proper sound.  I'll never fucking think.  I think there was some microphones in the bathroom.  What a lucky break. 
[01:38:00]  What a lucky break.  Actually, I was thinking of audio.  No, I was thinking of audio before the act was committed.  Oh.  I have no idea.  Let's see what's cooking in your room. 
[01:38:30]  Let's see what's cooking in your room.  Oh, her.  Shit.  You mean it might have been that they wanted to check and see if he had some blockage of  some sort.  Actually, he just, it wasn't even the whole act.  It was just the day.  He didn't want to do it on that day.  It's out Friday-wide.  Oh, Friday-wide.  Announcing when he's going to shit, so.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you got cooking in your oven over here?  I can't really hear it. 
[01:39:00]  That's a fake laugh if I ever heard one.  All right.  Well, we got more details.  Steve couldn't be happy about this.  And the most heinous act ever.  Heartless.  Heartless.  A mentally challenged man with a snake up his ass.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  More to the story here.  Of course.  A maintenance worker at the Shirley Lane's bowling alley, a 21-year-old developmentally  disabled man, was followed into the bathroom here and savagely sexually assaulted with a  mechanical plumbing device.  This guy's getting into it.  Savagely sexually assaulted.  With a mechanical plumbing device.  Oh, fuck.  Lucky fella.  Plumbers have gone wild.  A plumbing device. 
[01:40:00]  Plumbing.  The assault caused severe internal injuries, and the victim was found bleeding on the floor.  Charged in the attack were 19-year-old Stephen Rodriguez and 17-year-old Michael Lunsford,  both from Shirley, and both men now charged with aggravated sexual assault in the first degree.  No one with a bowling alley would talk with us on camera, but everyone here knows the  victim, and everyone here now knows what happened to him. 
[01:40:30]  There are obvious and unpleasant echoes in this case in the Abner Louima case, in which  a police officer sexually assaulted a man with a stick.  But this victim was developmentally disabled.  He was just 21 years old.  And also the plumbing, they don't even make the connection.  No.  It wasn't a stick, it was a plunger.  It was a fucking snake.  Yeah.  So it's like something about plumbing equipment makes people go, I gotta put this in somebody's  ass.  Now.  The toilet's clogged. 
[01:41:00]  Fuck.  Grab something and shove it up some guy's ass.  Tim from Connecticut on the instant feedback.  There's snakes, there's a motherfucking ass.  Snakes.  The fucking.  Oh, you know how filthy those things are?  He had the mind of a three-year-old and the asshole of a 38-year-old porn star.  Those things are filthy, too.  You ever seen a plumber's snake thing?  They don't sit there and clean them off.  No, they wipe them down with a rag for a minute.  Yeah.  It's not like they boil them afterwards.  Disgusting. 
[01:41:30]  It's not meant for the anus.  And then to spin it a few times, those things have like blades on them.  Yeah.  They have blades that.  Well, if you're gonna stick it in, you gotta spin it.  You gotta spin it.  What's the whole point?  You gotta go to the distance.  You gotta go to the distance.  You gotta go to the distance.  You gotta go to the distance.  No.  It's just stupid.  Yeah, it's a waste of time.  What's it look like?  Dude, we're here, let's spin the fucking thing.  Yeah.  It comes out of a big reel.  Yeah, I don't know what that looks like.  And it feeds out, it's almost like a metal conduit.  It's like a ring.  Like a coil.  Yeah.  And then inside that coil is a cable.  Yeah.  And on the end of it is some kind of a blade that spins. 
[01:42:00]  So you could crank away on this thing.  Yeah.  It's meant to cut through, you know, century-old shit that's built up in pipes.  Yeah, waste.  In your pipe.  And what you do is feed it down.  Or a retarded man's asshole.  Yeah.  You feed it down the toilet as you crank the handle.  Or the retarded guy's asshole.  Or the retarded guy's asshole.  And it cleans it out.  Dual purpose.  There you go, Jimmy.  There it is, Jimmy.  Look at this thing.  I'm thinking these guys, by the way, didn't do well on their SATs.  Nah.  Now, why was the snake in the bathroom? 
[01:42:30]  Well, maybe he had to go.  It's one of those things.  They don't usually just have him laying around.  Well, he was probably going in there to fix a toilet.  There was a toilet full of diarrhea and shit and tampons that he was fixing.  Oh, so you think he being a maintenance guy.  So they went in there and they improvised.  They found, yeah, they said, hey, let's use what he's using.  Well, they just saw the retarded man walking to the bathroom with the snake.  And the one guy went, are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Oh, my God.  And the one guy said, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  And then he goes, as he's holding the guy down, putting it in his ass, the other guy's  like, I just thought he wanted to turn the lights off and run.  I didn't know we were going to rape another man who was developmentally disabled.  Johnny and Spionk.  Johnny.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Johnny.  You ever been to this bowling alley?  It's Shirley.  I mean, you talk about animals.  And I'm not just the Spanish guys either.  Just the white trash that's out there is terrible. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, Shirley is not really a nice place out of Long Island.  Really isn't.  Oh, my God.  It's like Brentwood.  It's out of exit 64.  Exit 64 of the expressway.  It's around Waiting River, right?  Yeah.  It's somewhere in there.  It's like the last bastion of, like, condos and things.  And then you pass that and you're out, you know.  You're out on the island.  Wine country.  Right.  It's wine country.  Well, Shirley.  The retarded guy whining in the bathroom.  About this. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Johnny.  You got it.  Just a horrific story today.  All right.  And to think his life was going so great, too.  Yeah.  The retarded guy working in a bowling alley.  And Shirley.  And Shirley.  God, what a far tumble that was for him.  He's the only guy who ever had a snake in his asshole and it actually took him up on the  social ladder.  Yeah, it was.  I was on the radio.  I heard I was on Opie Anthony, too.  It was kind of cool.  I got a retarded guy with a snake up his ass in Shirley. 
[01:44:30]  Figured in you.  Hey, this is Louis C.K.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And I don't know what else you're doing, but I hope you die soon.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Let me unzip.  He said, go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did. 
[01:45:00]  I'm doing the best that I did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  That's what I'm doing.  He's really funny, though.  Now go away.  I remember these guys.  We're, we're, we're.  I remember these guys.  Who?  Just these guys.  The infamous Liberator. 
[01:45:30]  Has made its way into the studio.  What happened to O-Bent, too?  It's frozen right now.  You better get the, uh, the cams going on Pal Talk because we have, uh, Sunset Thomas stopping in to say hi.  And, uh, and Rebecca Love.  I wonder if that's her real name.  Ecuador's up 1-0 against Costa Rica.  Yes!  In case anybody cares.  Are you kidding?  Oh, yeah.  Did you say 1-0 again?  1-0.  Sorry.  Oh, my God, Bill.  It's my first week of World Cup coverage. 
[01:46:00]  Bill.  They're gonna kill you now.  The crowds, the crowds won last night.  1-0.  All right.  And we also have Uncle Al here.  Al Jorgensen.  Ministry is in the house.  And there's a story about fucking an ostrich we have to get to, according to Steve.  Let's say hi to Dave in Boston.  Dave.  What's up, you rat bastards?  What's up, Dave?  Hey, man.  I just want to give you guys your Boston update.  You guys were on the Herald this morning saying that, uh, after Marconi left and then Roth was a disaster.  And then, uh, the Herald calling you guys the dynamic duos and saying that you get triple the advertisement rates that was, uh, Roth. 
[01:46:30]  Ooh.  Oh, we're making money for BCN.  That's nice to hear.  Yeah.  A little nice press for you.  Have you ever talked about that time you were on Fox 25 and that homeless guy stole your spot?  Oh, me?  Yeah, I actually, I gave you guys a tape of that.  We never played that audio.  Oh, my stupid manager brought it over and then there was nothing on it.  It's like a visual thing, too.  You really need to see your, your face is so priceless. 
[01:47:00]  Savage animal.  Savage animal.  What is it?  It's a local, a local, a local interview and then a homeless guy comes walking onto the set or something?  Yeah.  And I just kind of interacted with him.  I think I gave him a dollar in the end of it.  Yeah.  But, uh, that was a while ago.  Yeah.  My, my manager brought it over and it didn't have anything on it.  So I, uh.  Great.  Who's the old guy out there?  Huh?  Who's the old guy?  Where?  Who's the old guy?  I don't know.  Who is the old guy? 
[01:47:30]  Who is that?  Ask him who he is and who he's with.  Psst.  Who's that?  Who, who's the old guy?  Psst.  We get uncomfortable when there's old guys around.  Why?  You guys don't know radio.  Yeah.  Because they make references that, you know, we don't get.  All right.  E-Rod's got the, uh, report.  Yeah, but it's fun to scare old people.  You boys like government cheese.  His name is Eddie.  He's, uh, with Sunset Thomas.  What do you mean, with? 
[01:48:00]  What do you mean, with?  I asked him, I was like, what does that mean?  He just, he points at it and he goes, with.  I was with.  I said, okay.  And came back into the studio.  What is that about?  So we know he's rich.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to bring in, uh, Uncle Al and then we'll bring in, uh, Sunset and Rebecca Love.  All right.  All right.  Let's, uh, get Uncle Al in here.  He's drinking his red wine.  Don't you love when you Google, uh, Opie and Anthony to see if the, the new stores are there  and it's shortlist announced for 2006 Edinburgh TV Fest and it's Anthony Fry and Lisa Opie. 
[01:48:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ow!  There he is.  Look at Uncle Ed's doin'.  What's up?  Seems like only yesterday I was here.  Yeah.  A little of both.  It's okay if you sit there.  That's my wife.  That's the one that hasn't divorced me yet.  Angie, Zal's wife,  ask again. We've got the wireless mic.  Is it going to be a live sex act here 
[01:49:00]  or can I sit on this Shea lounge?  You can sit for now. Let's just put it that way.  Do you want to see a live sex act?  There has been.  Would your wife like to see a live sex act?  Oh yeah, with me.  I'm not renting her out or anything.  No, we got other people for the sex act  that she just wants to watch it.  Alright, we're going to bring that in in a minute.  Alright, we haven't met this guy yet.  Who are you?  I'm Raven, bass player from Ministry.  Yeah, right on, man.  Also from Killing Joke. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, no kidding.  He's a limey bastard.  Yeah, he's a teabag.  I'm a teabag.  I can hear that. You guys like the wine too.  Just enough wine.  Well, we're still drunk from last night.  Is that it?  You guys didn't make it to the show.  It was kick-ass.  Nah, not last night.  We have to be in bed by 8.30, man.  We go to bed when you wake up.  We're faggots.  Got to go to bed at 8 o'clock at night  to get up at 4 in the morning. 
[01:50:00]  You guys are still going off.  Maybe for once we can at least act cool  and go, yeah, man, we stay up all night  that we come in here.  Yeah, there you go.  Have our smoothies.  That's right.  Have your smoothies.  I missed the show.  He's got a bottle of wine.  I woke up with a needle in my arm.  Right.  Way to go, Courtney Opie.  Yeah.  Courtney Opie.  Fucker.  Well, when you're right, you're right, though.  Yeah.  But you guys are sipping the red wine.  That's a little weird.  No, it's not weird if you're still drunk 
[01:50:30]  from the night before.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, that's taking it down like 81 notches for them.  Yeah, that's all.  It's drinking wine at like 9, 30, 10 in the morning.  That's that orange juice.  We were on the jacket about 7.  Yeah, that's like orange juice.  That's orange juice for rock stars.  Hey, there's probably more vitamins than there is in that orange juice.  That's right.  Vitamin G, man.  There you go.  Vitamin G, Bill.  Antioxidants.  That's right.  Cancer away.  It helps the heart, too.  Right there, Al?  I heard all that shit.  Al, we've been playing your stories  ever since you left last time. 
[01:51:00]  We do story time with Uncle Al.  Hey, what's the ostrich story about?  Oh, no.  Steve comes running in here and goes.  All right, guys.  I don't know if America's ready for this one.  Savage animal.  Yeah.  An ostrich.  It is.  Fucking animal.  Is there a city ordinance about bestiality stories?  No, no, no.  Before noon, I can do a bestiality story?  You just can't show it.  You just can't show it.  Well, that's what that couch is for. 
[01:51:30]  You got the ostrich, too.  That's fine.  Whatever we can find.  Road kill.  No, this is the sickest thing.  Look, man.  A story's a story.  We don't know if it really happened.  No, no, no.  There's going to be no lie detector test being taken here.  It happened.  It was.  Oh, it happened.  He wasn't, but it happened.  I completely believe it.  I was trying to help you guys out.  I'm not over this yet.  And I've seen a lot of shit in my life.  But this.  When did this happen?  This.  Last tour in Europe.  Yeah.  Pretty weird.  All right.  So we dropped a couple tabs of acid. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  Of course.  You're going to Europe.  We're on tour.  And we're in Europe.  What else are you going to do?  That's their multivitamin.  Yeah.  Well, that goes with the antioxidants in the wine, right?  It goes in the Bush mills.  It's cancer saving.  There you go.  So we dropped a couple tabs and we went to a zoo.  All right.  I'm not going to name the city in Europe because in case this ostrich is pregnant or something,  I don't want them to get back to us.  Hamster out.  Hamster out.  But I'm with my keyboard tech and we decide like we're so wasted on this Sid, right? 
[01:52:30]  We decide like we're going to hide in the bathroom and wait until like security closes the place down.  So it's nighttime.  We're walking around this empty zoo trying to dodge security people.  That rocks right off the bat.  We walk past and we're tripping balls.  We walk past this fence and there's a goddamn ostrich with its head in the sand or dirt or whatever.  Just totally like ass in the air.  And my keyboard tech goes apey, jumps the fence. 
[01:53:00]  I don't even know what the hell he's doing.  He goes there, unzips, drops trowel and tries to put his dick in an ostrich that's sleeping.  What is he thinking?  Is the ostrich not going to wake up and he'll get a quick shag?  I mean, first of all, how do you get hard when walking past an ostrich with its ass in the air?  You wouldn't even think of that.  And second of all, what is the ostrich pussy versus the ostrich ass?  He may be gay.  I have no idea, man.  You don't know where he's shoving it.  So he pulls his pants down to his knees and puts his dick in this ostrich. 
[01:53:30]  And this ostrich was pissed.  Well, what did you mean?  I know.  What did you mean?  Just smooth it away.  The thing...  No lube.  No, no lube, nothing, man.  No foreplay, nothing.  That's just rude.  That ostrich is like a whore.  The thing gets his head out of it.  It's like, hurr, like Scooby-Doo, hurr.  Pulls his head out and is pissed off and starts kicking the living shit out of him.  He's trying to run from it, but his pants are down to his knees so he can't run. 
[01:54:00]  And I'm tripping my brains out.  I'm just like, this is fucked up.  This has scarred me for life, dude.  I had to climb the fence and distract the ostrich.  It's a rodeo guy.  So it comes after me.  And these things kick like a motherfucker, man.  Yeah, they'll rip you apart.  What the hell's going on here?  So we had to help each other over the fence.  And this ostrich would not quit.  It was throwing itself against the chain-link fence.  Would you? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, of course.  If you're trying to nap and someone sticks their dick in you, I'm not stopping either.  I'm going to kick some fucking ass.  The best part is he didn't say a word.  He just went past the ostrich, saw the ass in the air, and got hard.  And said nothing.  Just jumped the fence.  I was like, what are you fucking doing?  The next thing I know.  You get a song out of that or what?  Not yet.  It's a double album coming up.  Yeah, what's that wrong?  It's going to be on the double live album.  Wow.  There's ministry with that new one, Ostrich Rape. 
[01:55:00]  Dude, you, you, you, like I do.  You know what scares me about bestiality?  It's like that, uh, have you ever seen that Hugh Manzi?  What?  Oliver.  Oliver, the Chimp Manzi.  You've never seen that?  No, no.  What's that about?  It's just too freaky.  Somebody had sex with a chimp, and the zygotes kind of mixed right, and it's totally creepy.  He's like an upright walking chimp that smokes cigarettes.  Oh, I didn't hear about that. 
[01:55:30]  I didn't hear about that.  It's grotesque.  I think you can find that on the internet, yeah.  I gotta see this, man.  You gotta Google, Human C.  That can't be real.  No, they've been trying.  There is no way.  No, I swear.  Hold on, they're onto something.  They've been trying to prove.  They're trying to figure out what this, uh, if it's really just a human being and something  got screwed up, or if there's some ape shit in there.  Do you understand the laws of nature?  No one will fess up.  No one will fess up. 
[01:56:00]  That's the thing.  But there are certain laws of nature that prevent that from happening.  No, no, but that's what I'm afraid of.  That's why I will not name the zoo in case if there's, like, an ostrich boy that came out.  Laws, like, arresting laws, I don't mean arresting laws, I mean laws that keep fucking ostrich  that plays the bass.  Right.  Dude, I don't know anything about it.  Laws that keep a penguin fish from a huge ass and very thin legs that likes to wear bullets. 
[01:56:30]  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  That's what I'm doing here.  That actually is me.  All right, Ed, I know.  There is just no...  Hey, where's the sex act?  When's that happen?  Yeah.  Come on, bring it in.  Kill the bird.  I could not sit in a bathroom in a closed area, tripping, waiting for a zoo to close.  I have a heart attack just doing that.  Not only did you guys do that, you waited and walked him by.  It was all good until he wigged out on me and just...  Some ostrich can just fuck up everything, can't they?  He saw an ostrich ass, got a boner, and freaked out on me. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, but he was tripping.  He didn't see an ostrich ass.  No, no, no.  He saw a giant feathered pussy.  Oh, I'm tripping.  Man, ostriches look great.  No, there is no excuse for that.  Yeah, you're right.  That's fucked up.  His story was the ostrich was asking for it.  They'll do that.  What do you think he's going to have?  The thing had garters on him.  That time at night?  Yeah.  Dude, you didn't hear that ostrich talking to me?  He just strapped a couple of feather dusts to the dog.  It was asking for it.  Oh, no.  It was asking for it with his ass up in the air like that, sticking its head down. 
[01:57:30]  That's the only thing I think of.  It's like he like...  He said no, it really meant yeah.  Moralized it or whatever and just thought like, wow, man, wouldn't it be great to have  a chick with her ass in the air like that and her head in the sand and just went off.  Only it happened to be an ostrich.  Hey, I got to ask you guys.  So anything else in the zoo that night?  No.  We got the hell out of there.  That's got to be creepy to walk around a zoo at night with no one around.  Especially tripping.  That was insane.  You dare each other to go into the lion cage a little bit?  We weren't even talking.  It was just like, we didn't say a word.  We were just walking around going, whoa, dude. 
[01:58:00]  Whoa.  Dude, can you imagine?  Jurassic Park, dude.  I know.  I just fucked a jaw and ostrich.  What are you telling me for?  These guys fucked up.  I love it.  Can you imagine how fucking quiet that must have been in a zoo?  Just you in the hand.  Whoa.  Yeah.  No, it was really creepy, dude.  It was completely creepy.  And then it just got bizarre.  It all happened in a split instant.  And what do you do?  You're watching your friend drop and trowel on an ostrich. 
[01:58:30]  And then the thing gets pissed.  And you got to divert it.  So I had to climb the fence, too, and get in there and wave my hands.  He sounds like one of those dudes in the extra.  One of the extras in the accused who watched the rape.  It all happened so fast.  I don't know what happened, man.  I was over there playing pinball.  The next thing you know.  I know.  Everything was fine.  And then it was interspecies rape.  On a pool table.  On a pool table.  The ostrich look like Kelly McGillis.  You can catch ministry at the Flamingo. 
[01:59:00]  No, you can't.  You can arrest ministry at the Flamingo.  Start out with something like a meerkat or something smaller than an ostrich.  Hey, no, no.  I have animals.  I don't approve of this.  This was something that was spontaneous.  Now you're going out on a limb.  No, I'm seriously taking a stand on this.  You're seriously saying fucking animals is wrong.  Right.  Wow.  More wine.  I know.  Call me square.  You're going to catch some shit for this.  He needs to cut some public service. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Ben, the boys need more wine.  Don't fuck your animals.  There you go.  Damn it.  More wine for the boys.  Oh, there's plenty.  All right.  Raping ostriches is wrong.  Yes.  That is so freaking funny, man.  That is a story and a half.  After I rape the ostrich, nothing will ever be the same.  I'm still scarred from this shit.  What about the ostrich?  Yep.  Well, yeah.  I didn't even think of that perspective.  That thing's in counseling right now.  Poor thing. 
[02:00:00]  Very lucky the ostrich.  I know when it sleeps now, it has its ass in the hole.  It's just fucking looking around, waking up every three seconds.  Head up, ass in hole.  Yeah, maybe I'll keep my head out of the fucking hole.  It's walking every bird's ass in hole.  He's talking to all the other birds.  Fucking ministry.  It's teaching a rape crisis thing.  Can you imagine the teasing that's going on there?  The good thing is there's in Europe where that kind of shit goes down every day.  Oh, yeah.  Wasn't in the U.S. a fucking day.  They're all filthy animals over there.  If anything, they're going to get sued for plagiarism or something like that. 
[02:00:30]  What the hell is this shit?  What do you guys...  Hey, Al.  What is this swag?  Hey, Al.  What?  Who?  Huh?  Al.  Al.  What do you guys think of the name Savage Animal for a band name?  That's all right.  I like the name Rising Sun Bandana.  Rising Sun Bandana.  Do you guys watch Supergroup?  Because they're trying to name that band and they wanted to name it Sebastian Bach.  It's got like Sebastian, Ted Nugent.  What was the name we came up with the other day? 
[02:01:00]  Oh.  Ostrich fucker.  No, no, no.  Oh, the Ku Klux Clowns.  We just wore Beatle covers.  Oh, wow.  That is brilliant.  That is brilliant.  Someone's going to steal that from you, man.  What are you going to do?  Clowns.  We'll come up with a better.  It's like clan members in the insane clown posse.  You just do, like, what, Beatle covers?  Just retwist the Beatle covers around a little bit. 
[02:01:30]  Around to make them a little politically incorrect?  Absolutely.  Speaking of the Beatles, Paul McCartney's wife, they're saying she was a prostitute back in the day.  I know, I saw that.  Really?  Actually.  Yeah, man.  What do you think?  Kind of thinking about it.  Man, you should have cut her leg off.  I think it was her with her head in the sand and her ass in the air.  Go around the kitchen on a skateboard with a couple of pounds of sugar.  And an elevator up where you've got to be.  Paul's turning 64 over the weekend, too. 
[02:02:00]  When I'm 64, he's finally here for good old Paul McCartney.  It's the end of the world.  When I'm 64, I'm going to be divorcing a one-legged hooker.  A one-legged ostrich.  Wasn't there to need him.  Wasn't there to feed him.  Get the fuck out, you legless bitch.  Do you guys just sit around and think of band names?  Is that one of the things you do on the tour bus?  Yeah, we do that.  There's not a whole hell of a lot else to do.  Huh?  Chick punk band names.  Who's a clown?  Say something. 
[02:02:30]  Go ahead.  Give it.  Clitty litter.  Wait, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Here we are.  Chick punk band.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Clitty litter.  Axe wound.  Axe wound.  Clitty litter.  Clitty litter.  Clitty litter.  Protein skimmer.  Protein skimmer.  God, I should have brought the list.  Oh, exactly.  Are you going to hold it?  Yeah, we're going to hold it.  We got like 700 on the list.  Contagious.  Contagious. 
[02:03:00]  Eventually, we're going to just have a whole stable full of these old chick punk bands.  And that's all our label is going to sign is just chick punk bands that we name.  Oh, just keep pumping them out with your names.  Yeah.  Boom.  We're up to about like 20.  I can't remember.  We got like 700.  These names are going to be taken on Wack Band.  Sorry, there's 700 on, we have like 700 on why does a dog lick his balls, right?  Yeah, we're up to 700 on that.  And then like 30 on the chick punk band names.  Wow.  We have a lot of time on our fucking hands.  A lot of like uterus jokes in there. 
[02:03:30]  Jeff Foxworthy would make a zillion dollars off the ball.  Dilate it to me, dude.  If you're a dog, it licks his balls.  We're like completely comedy specific.  Ministry at your cervix.  Only uterus jokes.  I love it.  Al, you never disappoint, I gotta tell you.  At your cervix.  At your cervix.  I'm delighted to meet you.  And you're calling your tour the Master Bait Tour?  Well, why not?  I got the revolting cocks on there. 
[02:04:00]  Master Bait Tour, 2006.  God damn.  Unless we're just whacking it all across America.  At Pitbull Daycare, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, they take care of our dogs.  Well, we're on stage.  The opening act takes care of the dogs.  They're the fluffers.  We brought our dogs.  The Pitbull Daycare guys are the fluffers.  Another bestiality point.  No, we actually, we brought our dogs on tour for the first time.  Well, two of them, Ozzy and Lemmy are their names.  Very loud.  Lemmy, the loudest dog in the world.  And they've gotten laid more than we have.  Really?  Yeah.  They're like, we've got some movies. 
[02:04:30]  We gotta show you.  Like I said, I'm not into that sort of thing.  Yeah, I hear you.  You can see the spike in peanut butter sales falling in the door.  You know what I'm saying?  God damn.  Screw the music.  You guys should be doing comedy, man.  Any problems with the dogs?  Is that why you had to get supervision for them?  Yeah, they got an STD.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Someone fucked my dog.  And somehow they got an ostrich STD.  That fucking ostrich, yeah.  Dude, that would be a weird animal.  Dog fucking an ostrich.  Dog stretch.  Dog stretch.  These guys, they're going to create the next virus.  You know what?  They're trying to find the first AIDS patient.  AIDS was the fucking dream.  You know what?  Yeah, we're going to call it H-I Flying V.  Yeah, H-I Flying V.  Yeah, that AIDS thing just started in a zoo somewhere in Africa.  A band was traveling.  Yeah, you know what?  It's going to be a combination of a bird flu and AIDS. 
[02:05:30]  We can take credit for it.  Instead of going to some third world place like Haiti to start some shit right here, made in the U.S.  So fucking AIDS.  How did this brand new STD?  How did this new strand of Ebola come out?  Well, evidently, somebody from ministry raped an ostrich in a zoo.  And then people can't believe it.  Spread it through its dogs.  Believe me.  Believe me.  There was barely, barely any penetration before the ostrich got pissed.  Well, maybe next time.  Nobody's going to believe it.  Fuck that.  The government started it, man.  That's some bullshit. 
[02:06:00]  They did.  Did he come to build a bird?  Hey, we got on the bus and we had like a whole bunch of feather dusters,  like taped to the dog and we knew something was going on.  What are you doing?  Did he come?  No.  No.  This thing was pissed.  Got pissed immediately.  And they're huge, too, dude, especially when you're tripping.  How did he reach it?  How tall was this guy that he could reach?  That's what I'm saying.  He was on his tiptoes.  This thing's huge.  I have no idea.  He didn't say a word.  He just jumped the fence and went at it. 
[02:06:30]  He didn't ask, like, you know, give me a leg up.  I want to try something.  He didn't give it any French kissing, nothing, man.  No clit tickling.  Nothing?  He just tried to put it right in.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even know if it was a dude or a chick, Austin.  I mean, how do you know that shit?  At that point, there's a really bad thing.  You look for an Adam's apple.  I just saw the fact that dude got...  I think you look for an Adam's apple.  It had really big knuckles.  I love how this dude just got instantly aroused.  It's like he saw it, jumped over the fence, and his dick is coming up. 
[02:07:00]  He's tripping, though.  He didn't see an ostrich.  No, you can't.  I don't care if you're tripping.  The males are bigger and have a much lovelier plumage.  I could walk past a million ostriches while tripping and definitely not get hard.  That's you.  That's him.  That's everyone.  He's got a bird for plumage.  What do I know?  I don't know.  All right.  It was fucked up.  I wouldn't fall asleep next to this guy.  I had to go in there and distract the thing.  That's warning.  And this thing was huge, and it was coming at you, and it was pissed.  I mean, pissed.  I've never seen a more pissed-off creature on this planet. 
[02:07:30]  With every reason to be.  Yeah.  In no fucking way that guy should have tried to fuck him up.  He's blaming the victim.  What an attitude on that fucking bird.  Fucking thing all pretty and colorful and shit.  Yeah, exactly.  You put a plume like that in the air, what do you think's going to happen?  Hey, when do we get the live?  Are we allowed to stick around for the live sex act?  Yeah, bring them in.  Bring them in.  I'm not sure what's going on.  Look, they brought in this, like, Cleopatra Shea lounge show.  If, uh...  Come on!  If she puts her head on the ground and puts her ass in the air... 
[02:08:00]  She just gave us...  The human money box is here.  All bets are off.  The human money box is here.  They hooked us up with a bottle of whack juice.  Oh, good lube?  Yeah, excellent.  You're having fun in here.  Lube is very important.  No fun a lot.  What's my mom doing here?  Give it to your Austin friend.  Hey, uh, can you guys put on a couple feather dusters real quick?  Just around the ass.  What's my mom doing here?  We can make it kind of seem like a reenactment. 
[02:08:30]  It's been a while.  That's Sunset Thomas, everyone.  Yes.  God, even her mic's shaped like a cock.  It's hard to talk into a mic shaped like a vagina.  I don't think they make this.  Sure, put one out.  Mine does.  The Sure V-A-G-150.  Yeah, you got to do something about the echo.  Sunset Thomas, and Rebecca Love is your friend?  Correct.  Yes, she is.  Hello, Rebecca.  She's got some diamonds on there.  You make this really hot.  I know, Raven.  And outside of maybe a few animals or something. 
[02:09:00]  Bite your finger up and swallow that motherfucker.  Wait for the shit.  You're shitting that out in Rikers.  You're talking about the huge diamond ring there.  I love you, baby, but I got to go.  What does that diamond ring mean?  What does it mean?  It was just a gift from a friend.  Just a gift from a friend.  See, you got to remember, it's on the wrong finger.  It's not a wedding ring.  That must have been a hell of a lap dance.  Is it real?  It was a hell of a lap dance.  It must have been a hell of a card dance.  Yeah, man. 
[02:09:30]  I know, 20 bucks, and I'm like, all right.  How many carrots is that?  That's huge.  Five.  Five-carat ring.  Yeah.  Wow.  The sun hits that.  It's a laser.  Would your boyfriend rape someone?  Chick in Colorado?  I don't have a boyfriend.  The only way I've ever seen a fucking...  Let's see a chick get a ring like that.  I don't have a boyfriend.  I'm solo.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm enjoying it.  Nice.  Not anymore.  Look at the way Raven's savoring his chops.  He's got that ostrich look.  I've got some Viber Strip here today for you guys, 
[02:10:00]  if you want any Viber Strip.  What is that?  We heard all about this stuff.  Yeah.  Wait, Al, you've heard it?  Al, just grab your mic and turn around.  That movie.  Where do I sign?  Can you tell me what it's about?  Yeah, what does that do?  What is this?  It's a sex enhancer.  Can you put them on your eyes?  I'll give you 500 bucks if you put them on your eyes.  I'll be impressed if you put them on your eyes.  Wait, wait, wait.  You have to wait one second.  This is the second best story of the tour.  His roadie puts Listerine strips in his eyes for 50 bucks. 
[02:10:30]  That's got to burn like a motherfucker.  It's the hardest way in the world to make 50 bucks.  I give it to you.  Wow.  His eyes are like that color.  He's holding up his wine.  He's like burgundy.  You can actually put that on your, you can put it on the nipple.  You can put it on the tip of your butthole.  And you go down on the cock and suck the cock and it actually starts getting it really nice  and hot.  Wow.  I know, but it gets too hot.  That's the thing that worries me about these.  No, it doesn't get too hot.  No, these warming gels.  It's like starts getting like a little bit cool. 
[02:11:00]  And then all of a sudden it's like, well, when's this going to stop?  Is my cock going to burn up like a fucking candle or what?  Like a ballpark, Frank.  So you freak out.  If you put it on the tip of your butthole.  I'm a Hebrew national.  My dick comes from a higher source.  If you put it on the tip of your asshole, you don't have to worry about it.  It just keeps tangling and you're getting blown.  Is there a tip of your asshole, by the way?  I'm trying to figure out.  Is there a tip of your dick?  Yeah, I have a little spike.  It's called a polyp. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, if you force out those duties, that's what I mean.  You stole it from the Ronald Reagan Museum.  I'm going to get my polyp circumcised someday.  Now, what do these things do?  Okay, what do you do is you take a piece of it like he's doing,  and you put it in your mouth, but you let it melt.  It's got a good flavor to it.  You don't chew it like hubba-bubba.  All of a sudden, after in a couple minutes, you start getting a sensation.  And your mouth?  It actually starts turning you on.  It's actually for male and female. 
[02:12:00]  And it's got a little breath thing as well.  It makes you horny and good.  What happens if you put it in your eye?  I love it because it's all natural, too.  It's all natural, too.  If you get really bored, you can just put them in your eye.  Honestly, if I take that, my head would explode.  I don't need that.  Look at you.  I need to chew something after looking at you and get horny?  Yeah, we do.  Well, it's not necessary.  Maybe you just wanted it like you're out partying or something  and just kind of want to get a little...  You just put some in your eye and you just suck it. 
[02:12:30]  It's like the new roofie, you know?  Oh, okay.  LSD strips.  That's what I was talking about.  I need something to chew that's so girls will fuck me.  How does that happen?  You have that kind of pill?  You've got to have them have their head in their sand first.  It's for both.  It's coax.  Can you chew it if you have a beak?  You don't chew it.  You suck it.  You suck it.  Just curious.  So you suck on it and it kind of gives a tingling, warming.  And if a girl puts this in her mouth and then gives a blowjob, 
[02:13:00]  it'll translate to the guy's...  Do a lap dance while you're talking.  Do a lap dance while I'm talking?  Okay, did you pop one of those vibran strips yet, baby?  There you go.  You're not supposed to fart when a chick gets on you.  He's farted, dude.  Did you just fart?  That's a typical bass fart.  He's English.  He's English.  He's English.  It's all right.  It's the way we say hello.  It's hello.  Yeah.  Notice how fast she got up.  That's the way we show our love.  My jeans are still wet from last night. 
[02:13:30]  It's bird cum.  Holy shit.  You guys have been busy, man.  I hear you guys all over the place.  We're taking over the world, man.  Yeah.  We're blowing up.  That's it.  We're like the new Hitler.  Hitler Lite.  Blitzkrieg in our way from station to station.  Hitler Lite.  A few less casualties.  Have you heard this fucking show?  You have no idea, Al.  Yeah, not quite light.  Yeah.  Low in carbs.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  That's it.  All the fun of Hitler without that weight gain.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  My, my.  Side effects.  You know, you said something fucked up when you get a porn star going, oh, my.  Oh, my.  She's offended.  Hey, Ecuador scored again.  So, come out and see me, guys and girls.  It's two to nothing if anybody cares.  It's something great that just happened to me recently.  Two nil.  All right.  What recently happened to you?  I just got a good gig in Las Vegas dancing with the ex-girls.  Really? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  You're mainstreaming it?  Yeah, I'm mainstreaming it.  That's it.  What do you got to wear?  You wear one of those big, heavy Vegas showgirl things?  Yeah, all the Vegas stuff.  A lot of ostrich feathers.  A lot of ostrich feathers on your head.  I know where you're going.  What fucking keyboard tech trying to fuck your mouth?  What's this other one about?  I don't know.  I just told her to scream and go, shut up.  I want to talk.  She's not.  I said that.  No, I.  Oh, you said that for me.  Is that Rachel Ray?  That was our talk.  They released the outbroken and released all the ostriches.  Is it what?  Is that Rachel Ray? 
[02:15:00]  Rebecca Love.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Rebecca Love.  God.  She doesn't watch it.  You know what?  It doesn't matter.  The redhead.  The redhead.  And what's your gig?  We got a redhead that will not speak here.  Just another porn star.  Yeah, another porn star.  Totally hogging the dildo mic.  You got to talk.  I like asking the porn stars this.  You won any awards at the.  Nominated.  Best oral.  Best oral?  Only nominated?  You didn't win?  Well, I was up against Vivid Girls.  I mean, how you win against a contract.  Vivid Girls can suck some cock. 
[02:15:30]  You're right there, honey.  Well, hey, at least I was nominated  with them.  It's better to be nominated  than to not be nominated.  Bullshit.  Than to be an Oscar.  Oh, really?  You want to win?  You want to win?  Yeah, but she's saying it's rigged.  Like those Vivid Girls have the inside track.  Really?  Yeah.  It's all rigged.  It's all rigged.  She's like the Kansas City Royals.  She's going up against the Yankees.  The odds were against me.  The Yankees.  They're a butt team over there at Vivid.  Yeah.  A butt team.  I just want to know.  The cock sucking award is rigged.  Did you have these mics especially made for these chicks? 
[02:16:00]  Because that's.  That is so fucking cool.  That is not like any mic I've ever used.  It's wireless with a big battery on the bottom.  If I use mics like that, I would be gay.  These are pretty heavy.  Yeah.  That is the gayest mic.  Big mic.  I'm trying to work out.  Totally like start sucking dick if I use mic.  They look like totally like the testicles at the bottom.  Yeah, there's a ball bag at the bottom.  It's really designed well.  There's a vein up the front of it.  And you guys look so good holding them.  Isn't it?  Look at that.  And your best oral nominee. 
[02:16:30]  Go ahead.  Will you stop touching my penis?  Oops.  I'm going to leave my penis a lot.  Wrong again.  There you go again.  Maybe that's why you didn't win.  You don't know how to cup the battery pack.  Yeah, stop touching the balls.  Just cup that battery pack at the bottom.  Yeah.  With a little tickle.  A little tickle.  See?  There you go.  She was a vivid girl.  She would have won.  That's fucking bullshit.  I know.  That's just...  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Totally rigged.  You got robbed.  I'm taking my cock and going home.  Until you fuck to get to the top.  You know, it's like I took it in the face. 
[02:17:00]  I licked his ass.  What more do I have to do?  These fucking vivid girls.  I don't even...  She barely even used her hand.  And I fucking lose.  The technique was not there, damn it.  Yeah.  What about anal?  You do...  Why do you do so much?  Because I watch a lot of shit.  I do anal.  I've seen a lot of shit.  You do anal, yeah.  You know I do.  Oh, you do...  Hey, yeah, I know.  Have I ever fucked you in the ass?  I'm trying to think back now.  Yeah, you did.  Wait a minute.  Was there that one time?  Yeah, but the question is, did you feel it? 
[02:17:30]  Weren't you in Rest Area 6?  I was working for Vivid.  I'm not a Vivic girl.  Rest Area 6.  The new sex motel.  Rest Area 6.  Only she had short black hair and her name was Bob.  I do remember now.  If anybody asks, I'm in Austin.  Just feed at the glory hall.  We'll leave the light on.  That's it.  You get a nice buddy through the glory hall at the rest stop.  That's not very common.  One finger comes through.  Ask you to...  That wasn't his finger. 
[02:18:00]  No.  No.  A little short stacked.  You banged her at the super rape?  That wasn't his finger.  The super rape.  It was at the zoo or something.  I can't recall.  You've won any awards for Best Anal?  Oh, God.  I haven't shot in two years, man.  I've been so busy doing this.  You haven't shot?  I haven't shot a movie or anything.  Oh, I thought you meant like...  You shoot something out of your ass when they fuck you.  I'm so busy doing a lot of mainstreams.  And I got two of my own gentleman clubs as well, which I just sold those.  See, you've gone legit.  Well, no, I didn't say I'm out.  You sold out, man. 
[02:18:30]  I'm just taking a break.  I'm just taking money and investing it and making money.  Sold out, man.  You quit doing Rest Area 6.  You sold out.  She bought in.  I'm busy doing my gentleman clubs.  Yeah.  It sucks when your favorite porn star sells out, man.  Wow.  Nothing.  Dude, I liked it when she was underground.  Yeah.  You know, I liked it when you were underground and only a few people knew about you.  I know.  On 8mm.  I know.  Then you started doing porn with condoms.  Yeah, condoms.  And ostriches.  Ostriches? 
[02:19:00]  You wouldn't take it up the ass anymore.  Selling fucking bread strips.  What?  You're not into that scene?  You didn't hear that?  No, I tried to stick with my own species.  You didn't hear that story?  Hey, good girl.  Total sellout.  Yeah.  I never bought in.  Great.  She won't fuck a panda bear.  Jesus Christ, what a prude.  A vivid girl would fuck a panda bear.  I got into black and white.  This is 2006, not 1956.  Panda bears are basically mulattos.  Are they?  I mean, if you think about it.  Black and white. 
[02:19:30]  Chew this.  It's eucalyptus.  It'll make you want to fuck a panda bear.  You can fuck them, just don't bring them home to your parents.  Jesus.  Ling Ling!  What the fuck is this?  This is like National Geographic porno going on here.  All together.  I've never heard so much bestiality in one conversation.  Jesus Christ.  At this time of the morning.  Thank you.  Ministry?  There's a city ordinance.  Usually we keep ostrich fucking until afternoon.  Are you guys going to the zoo after?  They did the zoo thing already. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, they did.  It's a real story with an ostrich.  What, you've had sex with animals?  Yeah, like people like you, you mean?  Yeah.  Oh!  Oh!  I'm mortally wounded.  You've got to take that!  Oh my God, I'm going down!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Ah!  Hey, good for you, spider.  Good for you.  You keep this.  You keep this.  I love sex with animals.  Yeah.  She loves sex with animals.  Yeah, why not?  A nice pony?  A nice one.  No, donkey. 
[02:20:30]  You know what?  Donkey.  Donkey.  She looks like a monkey.  Who hasn't watched?  Who hasn't watched?  Who hasn't watched?  They're good to go.  You've got to fuck mules because they can't get you pregnant.  Have you been?  She looks like she'd ride an owl.  I don't know why.  Owl.  Right away?  That'd be cute.  Ride a what?  She's got that little owl face.  Owl?  Yeah, like an owl, you know?  Sex with owls?  Yeah.  And you think I'm weird?  Dude.  What are you talking about?  How do you fuck an owl?  I'll make your head spin, baby. 
[02:21:00]  I'll make your head spin.  You have issues.  Hey, you fucking winked at me.  It was hitting on me, I swear.  Of course.  The guy that had the fucking ostriches yelling at you.  How do you do doggie style with an owl?  You must explain.  You just put him over there and then you turn their fucking head around.  And you don't have to worry about them fighting.  You turn back like those big pain-in-the-ass ostriches.  That's right.  What happens if the zygotes mix and you have a little owl human baby? 
[02:21:30]  That ain't ever happening.  You are so fucked.  I'll fuck it.  I'll send the payment.  Knock, knock, knock on the door.  You know what the best thing?  Who?  Who?  Who's your dad?  Yeah, the best thing about fucking an owl, you can fuck them in the ass while they're looking  at you.  With one eye.  Right.  Yeah.  The ever-staring eye.  Dude, you have serious issues.  You need therapy.  You've been thinking about how to fucking ass fucking owl.  You fucking did it.  You didn't do it.  The keyboard's not. 
[02:22:00]  I didn't do it.  You watched it.  I was the distraction from the pissed off ostrich.  I didn't fucking owl.  Oh, now he's the hero.  You're fantasizing.  You stood by while the ostrich got fucking raped and you did nothing about it.  And you helped the rapist get away.  I know.  That's what the fuck you did.  I'm an accomplice.  I gotta admit.  But the owl thing, I can't even rap my mind on it.  Do they even have feet for doggy style?  Do they even have a pussy?  Don't you need knees to get a girl into doggy style?  Do they even have fucking- 
[02:22:30]  You ain't never seen her feet.  He's talking about doggy style on an owl.  No, the reason, I said, what I said was she looks like she'd ride an owl.  There was something about her face that just, I don't know, it just reminded me of that.  What do you guys think?  Would you fucking owl?  God damn, who would have thought it came back on me?  You would fucking owl?  No, I wouldn't.  Not even if it clipped his nail.  What's why?  Couldn't get you pregnant, supposedly.  There's some, like, there's some severe honesty going on here right now.  What's the worst thing, like, situation you've had to do during your job in porn where you 
[02:23:00]  walked away, you had the money going like, oh, fuck, that really, like-  I actually did the same one time with a chick and her pussy kept farting in my face.  Right in your face.  She's a bass player.  Yeah, this guy, I know.  Comment on that.  Was she English?  How do you get turned on by that?  Yeah.  All right, so you left kind of feeling like, ugh.  That's different from any other chick, how?  Yeah.  That's what I want to do.  Wow, what position were you, like, 69 in or- 
[02:23:30]  69 in.  Yeah.  And she just farted her ass off.  Yeah, man.  What a slob.  Jesus.  It was gross.  Echo, echo, echo.  Told her.  God damn.  You should have told her.  Hey, you farted in my face with this thing.  I did.  I said, you gotta stop farting in my face.  Honey, it's like eating an exhaust fart.  You told her that?  Yeah.  Do you see that shit on the set?  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  Man, you gotta quit squirting or farting or-  Well, I like it when they squirt now.  I love it when they squirt.  Squirting is hot.  Listen, but it's different when they really have no orgasm and they squirt.  Oh, that's hot.  I know.  That's hot, right? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, it tastes good, too.  I love squirt.  Oh.  I like to put on the scuba mask and the snorkel.  Squirt is real.  Snorkely, man.  Your wife loves this, huh?  She don't give a crap.  She's a squirter.  She's a squirter.  Wow.  Now she's giving you that.  Ex-nay.  No squirter.  You never know who's listening.  Oh, now we're getting too personal, Al.  Real simple.  Yeah.  Squirting good, farting bad. 
[02:24:30]  Rules to live by, Lloyd.  Rules to have sex by.  With people.  With people only.  Animal.  I gotta sneak out.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Oh, Opie.  I gotta sneak out.  I gotta leave.  I gotta leave.  I gotta leave.  But you guys continue.  He's gotta go watch golf.  We're not important enough for you to hang out.  I gotta go to the Viber Strip with you.  Drink, mother fucker.  He's got a blind date in the vet reclinic.  What?  See, look.  She's already got it.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  Goddamn, they're handing out dildos. 
[02:25:00]  Look it.  We're handing out all sorts of toys over here.  Look at that.  Hey, Jenna, any chance?  Double dog.  Awesome.  Any chance for a demonstration?  She gets to keep that.  She gets to keep that.  Hey, I want the wack juice.  Wash that first.  Get the warming wack juice.  What the hell is that?  That's one for you.  That's the tongue joy.  Is that a tongue in a bag?  Forget about it.  He goes forget about it.  What kind of Jeffrey Dahmer shit is...  I can share.  If I can pull up to the snatch in the box,  I'll have a tongue to go. 
[02:25:30]  The guy just like...  He just took it and stole it.  What is that?  It's a face?  It's a tongue and mouth in a bag?  That you just stick your dick in?  It's a little bullet that you put on your tongue and it vibrates.  Oh, that'd be great when EMS is trying to pry it out of your throat.  You can mix your cocktail.  You can mix your cocktails.  Anthony, that's awesome.  Put it in your eye.  I did a Robin recommends on that.  Put it in your eye.  That thing, you need that right there.  I thought it was like a male jerk toy thing.  No, no. 
[02:26:00]  These guys are way more sophisticated than that 30s shit.  It's like a little vibrating bullet that you strap to your tongue.  No, it's a vibrating bullet you put on your tongue.  You strap it to your tongue.  I bet you if you put the Viber Strip on that with it, it'd be intense.  You might go back in time, lady.  Don't stop mixing your toys.  What the hell is this?  Don't stop mixing your toys.  Hey, I'm Rachel Ray and I make 20-minute meals.  That's what I just...  What is this, inner space?  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  It's like a Star Trek dildo.  They're going to fuck the camera. 
[02:26:30]  That's a camera.  Oh, it's a camera.  All right, you first.  No, you first.  The camera that's now off.  I was trying to say she looked like an owl.  Yeah, I know.  I saw that.  Raven, you look...  Her looking like one and fucking one is two different things, though.  Hey, it's Judy.  I have a Judy.  Okay, there are eight different conversations going on here.  I haven't even done anal important if you're going to stick the camera in.  See what happens when Opie leaves the room?  It's so awesome.  If you go to our website.  Our anchor's gone.  Way to fucking go, pussy.  Steve is handing out the dildos right now. 
[02:27:00]  That's something called...  I have that.  Let me get everybody's attention for a minute.  All right, all right.  What is that that Steve is holding right there?  It's the rabbit.  That is the rabbit.  Now, that's pretty famous.  Yeah.  That's pretty famous as a sex toy.  It has kind of a rotating ball bearing thing at the top, and then it's got something that...  Yeah, it's like the rabbit.  The top of the penis part swivels, and then the other thing, either that is a warp drive  or it does the clit.  And then it's got a remote control for speed. 
[02:27:30]  It's like a drunken Nazi.  And turn it up!  Did you see that movie Anaconda?  I'm going to go out on a limb here.  Hey, there's enough drunken Nazis in here already.  What are you kidding me?  Is there any way we can get a demonstration of how that works?  I'm talking Steve C. Up your ass.  Anyway, no.  Is there any way?  Put that in your pussy.  I dare you.  We got lube.  All right, we'll compliment you.  Let's put it up your ass.  We'd like to take that for a test drive.  Rebecca, you've got to do the Viber strip with it.  Can you do the Viber strip?  You've got to do the Viber strip.  Because we want a little bit of a sex show here for the Rockstar. 
[02:28:00]  I'll let you guys hear you.  Are you sure you don't want me to take it?  Oh, yeah.  All right, baby.  No, you're going to take it because I'm going to take it.  All right, I'll stand up so I can get a good look and drive the action.  Don't fart and turn it off.  You want a bird's eye view?  Ha ha!  All right.  She's putting the Viber strip in her mouth.  She's sucking on it.  I'm in the people now.  People power.  What kind of sensation are you getting there?  It's like a Listerine town.  It's a little, but tingly.  It takes away bad breath.  I'll say that. 
[02:28:30]  You're like hot as a little firecracker.  God damn it.  You don't want bad breath when you're going to be sticking your mouth on a pussy.  I was just being profound there for a minute.  That was very poetic.  All right, now, Lube.  We need Lube immediately.  I have some.  Do you got the...  We're not talking out of your tap.  Lotion boy.  Lotion boy.  Her panties are coming off.  That's very nice.  And Anthony, Ecuador is still up two to nil.  Thank God, because that's the important part.  In the 75th minute. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  The panties are on the head.  Here, try one of mine.  The Englishman has panties on his head.  I just gave a porn star some lube.  Look at that.  All right.  We got a little bit of snatch going on over there.  That's very nice.  Good morning.  They're on the little couch we got in here.  A little tapping going on.  Something, I'm not hungry.  Why don't you put a Viber strip on my clit?  Hey, how about that?  Put a Viber strip on her clit.  Put it in your eye.  Put it in your mouth.  Put it in her eye.  Put it on the brown eye.  Now, get it right in. 
[02:29:30]  I like the tapping.  Open septuagenarian.  Now, we have lube.  Did we have lube?  Are we going to have to use Brokeback Mountain spit on it lube?  Hey, that was the sexiest part of the movie.  I love you.  I actually went into that thinking it was a horse fucking movie.  I was very disappointed.  I can't quit clit.  All right.  Well, now she's lubing it herself.  Look at that.  A little action going on there.  Raven.  Damn, don't you think I've seen enough unpleasantness for one day? 
[02:30:00]  God damn it.  Would you rather have a couple of fucking ostriches in here?  Raven.  What are you doing?  We got some pussy licking going on there.  She didn't even have to do anything.  And then there's...  No, but her.  What do you think this is?  Avenue Q?  At least put a pinky up her butt or something.  Don't put a pinky up her butt.  I can't.  Is that like a baby mouse?  Look.  That.  Look.  Pretend she was an ostrich.  Her ass is in the air.  You're walking by and you're tripping. 
[02:30:30]  Think about it.  I love you.  All right.  The rabbit is going to get used here.  I believe some lube going on there.  Yeah, that's my lube.  Don't...  Hey, be spare.  Hey, that works good.  God damn it.  I need it for me.  Oh, she's jacking the mechanical cock and lubing it all up.  And then we'll turn it on and see how this thing works.  Did you put some of the strip on her clip?  Yeah, I did.  I licked her pussy.  No, wait.  Is that thing on the part that spins around like a drunken Nazi?  Like a drunken Nazi. 
[02:31:00]  I think she's got to get it in first.  I'm so fucking wet right now.  Are you?  No.  No, of course not.  Did you just say Ein Speich Slice?  I was like Ein Speich.  I was doing the old Pewter, the big Pewter Bierstein song that they do during October.  Head's in the way.  You know what creeps me out is your cameraman.  He never shows any emotion.  And he's a total voyeur, man.  He's a pervert.  He's like a bicycle seat sniffer.  He's like the Zabruder of pussy. 
[02:31:30]  Keep going.  Turn it up.  He's waiting for her fucking head to come apart.  He's a creepy fuck, man.  He's a creepy fuck.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  All right.  If I get shocked.  What are you going to get shocked?  Get in there.  Zoom lens, motherfucker.  You know, shoved up the All Street story.  There's no idea.  Zoom in.  He knows how to direct porno.  Yeah.  Turn it up.  It's getting in there.  It's getting in there.  All right.  Is the thing tight?  What is that?  Are you actually getting hot?  I can't hold everything.  You're actually getting hot, aren't you? 
[02:32:00]  I can tell.  You're like reading different.  Use the wand on her clit.  What the hell is that?  It's a floss machine.  Use the wand on her clit.  Spin that rabbit around.  Stick the other part up her ass.  Get some few tips for her ears.  She's got a desk lamp.  I want something up her nose.  She doesn't have a hole in her abdomen.  Put it in her ass.  Spin it around.  It's a crash test ostrich.  What the hell is the floss machine for?  Oh, I got it.  The floss machine?  What is that thing?  That's a magic wand.  All right.  That's so it can reach those hard to get out of her ass.  Put the other part up her ass. 
[02:32:30]  That's supposed to be.  Oh, she's got a little Hitler mustache.  Right now, I don't know what's working.  It looks like a pubic.  It looks like they're digging for a tumor.  A Hitler mustache.  I wish my masseuse would do something like this.  What the hell's your masseuse?  You're actually getting hot.  That's awesome.  She's got tight pussy, man.  Uh-oh.  That's because there's a barbecue in it.  Fucking Weber grill.  Look what you got going on there.  The woman, she's swallowing a hibachi with her vagina. 
[02:33:00]  There's a lot of machinery going on down there.  We got a basic fondue kit going on.  That is a lot of machinery down there.  Let's listen to the porno dialogue.  Yeah, here we go.  Go ahead, girls.  Give us the dialogue.  You're on.  I like that, don't you?  Oh, you little bitch, you.  Yeah, fuck my cock.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, this time with feeling.  But that's not your cock.  Don't ruin it, Al.  The mechanic's cock.  There it is. 
[02:33:30]  Okay, right there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  The fucking limey's farting again.  Come on it for me, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Fuck, I can't even fake it.  Oh, wow.  Did you really fucking come?  No.  Of course not.  I didn't think so.  There's too many people laughing.  I love it.  Fuck it.  I can't even fake it.  That's honesty.  I like that.  She's honest. 
[02:34:00]  She can't.  She saves too many people around.  She from a porn star can't even come.  You're absolutely right.  That's why you're a star.  Steve, get out.  Hey, your cameraman's creepy, dude.  We know.  Who's that?  And he's a mix between a white guy and a black guy.  And an ostrich.  And an ostrich.  I'll tell you what.  He's the panda.  He's got some serious DNA issues, man.  He's an ancestor of Thomas Jefferson.  That's true.  Yeah, that's it.  Hold the vibrator against the microphone.  That worked well.  Ow.  Yeah.  The hell was that? 
[02:34:30]  No, wait, wait.  Hey, fam, what's harder to control, this or the Tippi Tom interviews?  You guys got an encore coming up, right?  I love how Opie just ran out on this.  You got to do an encore.  We have to do it.  Oh, you're going to do an encore.  No, I don't think we want to see them do an encore unless it's ostrich fucking.  Unless it's anal.  I don't want to see the tip of the ass.  I don't want to see what that looks like.  You don't want to see my tip of my ass.  I want to see the tip of her ass.  She's not doing it.  Hey, tip of my ass has like a polyp problem. 
[02:35:00]  Could we see your blowjob technique on that?  Because I want to see what came in second.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We think you should have won.  Yeah, let me see the blowjob technique.  Put down the wine, pick up the cock.  On anything.  The plastic thing, the wand, the English guy.  Whatever you want to use.  All right, first.  That's a good name for you.  Give the girls a lesson.  See, now we're learning.  Put down the wine, pick up the cock.  Give the girls a lesson.  I use my hand as an extension of my mouth.  Uh-huh.  So when I go down, I'm not going to talk. 
[02:35:30]  I'll just show you.  Okay.  I'm not going to stop.  And I do a twist to the arm.  Oh, it's a radial, girl.  Twist.  Mm-hmm.  It's like a childproof cat.  And some guys like you to squeeze hard, and some guys want it soft.  Yeah.  But then you go down to get more wetness on it.  Right.  We want it length.  Like really hard.  And you swallow to deep throat it.  Yeah, yeah.  Like you swallow it like food, and you get further down.  It is food.  I did.  Swallow it like food.  It's like a fucking ballpark.  Swallow it like food.  What do you mean?  I don't understand.  That's awesome.  Just kind of demonstrate.  That's great.  Quote of the day. 
[02:36:00]  The rubbery stuff tastes nasty.  Yeah, it tastes a little nasty.  But then you're using your hand.  It's a wine bottle.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Forget the rubbery stuff.  We got an English guy here.  It's almost rubbery.  It's okay.  It's almost a penis.  But at the same time, I'm like grabbing the balls, and I'm holding it.  The balls.  The penis with bad teeth.  Maybe that's why you came in second.  And then as you go down on the cot, you do the strokes.  Where are you from?  Upstate New York.  Oh, now we're getting a demonstration. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  But the best way to give a blowjob is have the guy go over you 69.  Look at that.  So you can toss the salad, lick the balls, and boobie at the same time.  So you're like multitasking.  Wow.  Multitasking.  All right.  I like how she brings the high-tech world of business terminology into sucking cock.  That was nice.  No problem.  That was nice.  And that came in, Jesus Christ.  That came in second?  What came in first?  The corporate takeover.  The corporate takeover.  I don't know if they judge on the movie. 
[02:37:00]  The woman had a vagina on her chin.  Yeah, the little man got shagged.  With their mainstream dick sucking.  They call her old pussy chin.  I want to know how you would fuck an owl or suck an owl off after you had your own fantasy.  First you move to seven.  Do you reach around the owl?  I don't even know if they have a dick or pussy.  Next time you have a gig in Portland, someone on your bus is going to do it.  There'll be some spotted fucking owl up there.  No, you're up.  I'm up.  There's laws against that here. 
[02:37:30]  You're up.  Always keeping it in another country.  All right, Vancouver.  All right, you know, I would love to stay here and watch these girls suck on anything that even resembles a penis,  but it's about that time.  Any plugs?  I want everybody to get their plugs out.  Guys, gentlemen.  Fuck you.  You don't shill shit.  Fuck you.  All right, you ostrich watching that fuck motherfucker.  We are where we are, and if you're not, you're a fucking asshole.  That's the best plug I've ever heard in my life. 
[02:38:00]  Thank you for tuning in.  We'll see you tomorrow, man.  Hey, this is the Alien for Ministry, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's all get naked and hug in the woods.  Yeah, look at my cock.  Very nice.  Yeah, look, you're all shaved and I'm all shaved.  You've got to respect that.  I consider the cock.  We'll suck dick for friendship.  I don't want people looking at me shoving this hog in my mouth.  Why?  Don't take the whole penis in your mouth.  Why?  You're going to gag for sure.  Oh, gosh.  So you're going to perform oral sex on him? 
[02:38:30]  Yes.  You can lick and kiss and suck and do whatever you like.  I love him.  And do that up the shaft of the penis and along the side and around to his testicles.  And then you take just the head of his penis in your mouth.  That's all.  Open their mouth real wide and shove that in.  And you drink quantities of saliva down the shaft of his penis.  What a great blowjob technique.  Holy crap.  Rip the penis very gently with your hands.  I think it made me a little butt sack. 
[02:39:00]  Then let him use the dildo.  Put it in.  Pull it out.  How'd you like getting your shitter?  I like to lick ash.  This is great.  It's not gay if you're single.  You two homos know a lot about sucking dick.  You got it down to the science, it sounds like.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  You change your mind like a girl. 
[02:39:30]  Change your clothes.  Yeah, you.  PMS.  Like a chick.  I would know.  And you.  Always think.  Always speak.  Cryptically.  I should know.  That you're no good for me.  Cause you're hot then you're cold.  You're yes then you're no. 
[02:40:00]  You're in and you're out.  You're up and you're down.  You're wrong when it's right.  It's black and it's white.  We fight.  We break up.  We kiss.  We make up.  You.  You don't really want to stay.  No.  You.  You don't really want to go.  Oh.  You're hot then you're cold.  You're yes and you're no.  You're in and you're out.  You're up and you're down.  How is that?  Perfect.  I think I didn't do too bad on the song. 
[02:40:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Alright let me unzip.  Let's say hi to Dawn in New York.  Dawn.  Hi how you doing?  Whoa.  How's sexy Dawn?  What's up Dawn?  We finish with politics, oil and dogs.  What's that sweetheart?  Are we finished with the politics, the oil and the dogs?  What would you like to talk about?  Yeah what do you want?  I want to know. 
[02:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  What about.  Do you ever play Tom Waits?  Well Tom Waits is kind of a classic rocker.  Slower.  Do you mean on the show?  Why would we play Tom Waits?  Do you like the.  What's your favorite Tom Waits song?  Oh come on he's got like 20 albums out there.  No kidding.  But if you want to play one you can play God's Way on Business.  But you don't have Tom Waits do you?  No we don't. 
[02:41:30]  And this is a radio station?  Cutting edge.  You're preaching to the choir.  Oh my god.  Listen you deep voice dyke.  Listen you disgusting sounding whore.  What do you think?  Are you familiar enough?  You're not familiar enough with this to know it's a talk show dummy?  Do you call up Larry King and request a song?  You idiot.  You are a dunce.  We didn't spend years and years honing our craft so we don't have to play music so we 
[02:42:00]  can take calls from you.  Man voice.  Hey man voice.  Oh you're hurting me now.  Yeah you know I am.  Oh you're hurting me now.  Hey all right Herman Munster.  Listen to that.  Why don't you smoke 18 more cigarettes this hour.  18?  Yeah.  You're giving me credit.  Yeah.  What are you listening to right now?  Ugh.  Tom Waits.  No you're not.  What radio station are you listening to?  I thought I was listening to the Cutting Edge. 
[02:42:30]  What are you talking about?  God I hate you.  Tom Waits.  What radio station?  What radio station are you listening to?  K-92-3.  When did they remove your ovaries to give you that voice?  When did you ever hear the station play Tom Waits?  Did you have your whole...  You had a complete removal of your female organs and no more female hormones are pumping  through your body right?  And what's that got to do with playing Tom Waits?  What's it got to do?  I'm right though. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  Hey Manhattan mini storage womb.  We're trying to ask you a question.  Better Off Without a Wife.  Is that the song you want to hear?  That thing just ends like it was bricked off after they removed all the goodie parts.  Yeah she had the procedure that's called the old ice cream scoop.  Take it all out and leaves you with a nice mustache and goatee.  But my ears work fine.  Do they?  I can hear my voice is horrible.  I don't give a damn about it.  No you do. 
[02:43:30]  It hurts you doesn't it?  It hurts you.  I've been living with it for 52 years.  52 years.  Do you like Tom Waits because he has a more feminine sounding voice than you do?  Exactly.  I think he has a melodic voice.  Melodic.  God that voice.  When did he get divorced?  When did your husband leave?  Same time your womb did?  Huh?  He's still here.  Oh is he?  Yeah.  Yeah unfortunately for him. 
[02:44:00]  Well listen Tranny.  Is he uh are you happily married?  At times.  Are you attractive?  Are you kind of fat or you're a lovely looking girl?  Someone is very confused.  They're they're they're saying it's Chris from Long Island.  I can't go to his phone call right now.  I was he's saying is this Tom Waits calling in to request Tom Waits?  Oh.  Hey um hey Chris Sarandon from Dog Day Afternoon.  Um what exactly made you think that this this station.  You're not dying Sonny. 
[02:44:30]  You're killing everyone around you.  What makes you think that we play Tom Waits on this talk show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is anybody in the station later?  No.  Not on the cutting edge.  Not on the station.  92.3 the cutting edge.  Well isn't he cutting edge?  No.  Well what is he?  He's an older man.  No one.  An older man?  You ask.  Oh oh oh oh oh.  Oh oh oh oh.  Lily.  Lily.  Grandpa.  Could you play Tom Waits?  Grandpa. 
[02:45:00]  Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  So I'll never hear it like that.  Oh oh oh oh oh.  The Rolling Stones or anything like that on this stage.  Yeah.  You're too old.  The Rolling Stones are your ovaries.  Fine, fine, fine.  Make all the jokes you want.  But you don't play Tom Waits.  Toot and common womb.  That's right.  You don't play Tom Waits, and I don't reproduce.  So we're even.  My son about that one. 
[02:45:30]  How old's your son?  13.  Really?  And he loves Tom Waits.  I couldn't love Tom Waits.  Enough about Tom Waits.  Really?  She probably just plays it 24 hours a day in our house.  Happens.  No one knows what to do with Tom Waits.  Tom Waits, the radio programmers have never figured out what to do with Tom Waits.  Sure they have.  Don't play him.  Maybe they should try playing him.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  Everybody will buy his CDs.  And then everyone will stop buying iPods. 
[02:46:00]  Throw his CDs in the same bio-waste container your woman parts are in.  That's what I say.  How about this?  We'll play Tom Waits.  If you can tell me how old he is.  He is 58.  He'll be 59 in December.  I lied, bitch.  Why am I not surprised?  Do you know who you're talking to even?  Yeah.  Do you know the name of this show?  Opie and Anthony.  What do you know about Opie and Anthony? 
[02:46:30]  I know you mellowed a lot since you came to this station.  Oh, damn.  That's going to hurt.  We did.  In what way, ma'am?  In what way?  Yeah.  You just talk about dog tricks and oil.  Dog tricks?  Oil and dog tricks.  What's a dog trick?  All right.  Speaking of oil, how much of it do you need for your husband to have any satisfaction?  The dog ate the person's toe.  Woo-hoo.  Hey, it's Howard. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, that's a real story.  Yeah, but then it led into old people getting eaten by their pets, which was a fine conversation.  So, miss, you don't think it's worth talking about when a dog eats its owner's toe off and she doesn't notice it?  You don't think that's worthy of making fun of?  Kind of funny.  You're a tough one.  It doesn't faze me in the least.  Of course it doesn't, because you probably have three toes left, old sugar feet.  Yeah.  What happened to your parts?  You go a little too deep with the peanut butter? 
[02:47:30]  That was enjoyable.  Oh, I'm going to say that.  Eddie.  You know, Marilyn, I don't have any womanly parts.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Grandpa, could you whip me up some ovaries?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  You have to take my womb.  Darn, darn, darn, darn. 
[02:48:00]  Go to the hospital, Grandpa.  I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't.  All right, go to the hospital.  Get in, Dragula, Heyman.  I'll take you.  I go to the hospital.  Grandpa.  I'd love that terminal.  Bye-bye.  Can we get more?  Oh, she went away.  Oh, boy.  Damn her.  Oh, boy.  Whip me up some ovaries, Grandpa. 
[02:48:30]  Grandpa, I need fallopian tubes.  Okay, Heyman.  God damn, I hate her.  Dawn.  Tom Waits.  Tom Waits.  Where did that come from?  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  We'll step aside.  Don't play the casey. 
[02:49:00]  We're late.  It's amazing.  She doesn't like the show, so we immediately imply that she has no womb.  But I think we were right.  But just, hey, I'm not enjoying your show.  All right, let's attack the heart of our humanity.  Oh, God.  Hey, I'm not taking your show.  Ha ha, you can't reproduce.  We are horrible.  Right.  Look who's in studio. 
[02:49:30]  Bill Burr, everyone.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  What's going on, guys?  We miss Bill.  I miss you guys, too.  I'm trying to swallow some food here.  Out there.  A hinder moment.  I'm serious.  I'm like giddy.  It is good seeing you.  Yeah, it's great to be here.  You got to move back.  I don't see you that much.  Move back to New York.  What are you doing out there in L.A.?  Trying to make it and stuff.  Come back to New York.  I know, I know.  And hang with the boys.  I know.  There's no, uh, yeah. 
[02:50:00]  My mornings suck out there.  Put it that way.  Yeah.  I got to get my XM thing fixed because I got to listen to you guys.  That's why, you know, I was saying, you asked me to call in and stuff, but I always  feel like I'm going to disrupt.  You know, how do I know somebody's?  The flow?  Yeah, somebody's getting puked in their mouth like I don't want to be calling.  Hey, how you guys been?  Yeah, Phil, we're a little busy.  Oh, so you want to be able to listen to see where we're at with the show before you call  in.  Yeah, I was thinking maybe like towards the end of the show when you guys want to get  out of here, then I'll call in.  That's actually a very good time to call. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, hold us, yeah, and annoy the hell out of you guys.  Let's go.  I like your Desert Storm boots there, Anthony.  Yes, this is part of my 5'11 gear.  Very easy.  See, it's got a little Velcro thing here, and then the zipper comes down, and the whole  boot comes off.  So that way, at the airport, it's so easy to take your shoes off.  You know, when he flies once a year.  No, I fly a lot.  It's very easy.  Broken glass when you're chasing an intruder?  Yes, that too. 
[02:51:00]  Quick zip.  Zip, Phil.  Have you noticed?  He's looking like a young Fidel Castro every day.  That's what I'm doing.  You really are.  I'm also wearing my 5'11 5'11 shirt.  Look at this.  Very tactical.  Look at this.  Opens.  Holster in the shirt.  There's a holster built into the shirt.  Thing's wonderful.  Just bought a new gun, too.  A Colt Custom.  Dude, when are you going to take me shooting?  Nickel-plated 45.  I'm, like, into it now, by the way.  Shooting?  Yeah, I went to Houston, and the club owner took me out shooting. 
[02:51:30]  It was the coolest.  I was scared to death.  Brought a 45.  I couldn't hit anything with it.  Like, literally, that stupid paper cutout was where that clock was.  And I'm literally shooting.  I'm seeing water spraying up, like, 200 yards beyond the target.  But I'll tell you, for the beginner man, the 12-gauge.  Oh, yeah.  You can't miss with that thing.  That is a fun little weapon, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's great.  Kablam.  Yeah, I just bought a new .45.  Bought a new Colt Custom.  What, did you get the 2008? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  That's good.  I walked in there, and I just asked the guy.  I said, I want something shiny and loud.  That's what I'm down to with guns now.  Like, I got the ones I want that I've always wanted for their accuracy, shooting, how it feels in your hand.  And now I just want ones that are like, yeah, this is like the one Vince Vega had in Pulp Fiction.  Could I have that one?  That's hilarious.  I just want, you know, shiny gun.  How many guns do you have to buy in there to get, like, the free Big Lebowski sniper shades? 
[02:52:30]  Throw in those yellow-tinted things?  Yeah.  Get a punch card, like, your 10th gun is free.  How many handguns are you up to?  I don't know.  Let me think.  Watch track?  Yeah, I have a lot.  I never like letting, you know, the enemy know how much I have.  Right.  You know, around the house.  He carries in his own house.  Did we tell you that last time? 
[02:53:00]  What, are you going to have pajamas with a built-in holster?  Hell, everything I got has a built-in holster.  It's wonderful.  It wasn't good enough to have guns around the house that he could get to pretty quickly.  Now he actually carries within his own home.  You know, it's not safe to just have loaded guns laying around the house.  It's true.  It's just not.  I'm a very safe gun owner.  So if I have it on me, there's the safety.  It's right there.  If an intruder perhaps comes in, I don't have to lunge for a drawer or hope, you know, to make it to the gun.  What did you do in your past that you're this paranoid? 
[02:53:30]  You're a nice guy, Anthony.  I just, I don't know why.  But I think it's because I watch the news.  I see that the county I live in is home invasion capital of the country, apparently.  So I'm not going to be the guy.  I'm not going to be that guy that gets the home invasion and sits there.  Because, you know, every single one of those bastards are sitting on the floor getting pummeled going, I wish I had a gun.  There isn't one of those guys that aren't wishing for a gun.  It's not like, I wish this gentleman had been more educated when he was growing up. 
[02:54:00]  And perhaps I had two parents in the house and taught him values.  It's like, I wish I had a gun.  It gets very primal at that point.  As much as we all think you're insane, that is a very good point.  It's just a valid point.  I know.  Perhaps I am a bit extreme.  I've come the other way.  Yeah.  I think everybody should have a gun.  I don't think it's good that only the government and the bad guys have guns.  It's not good.  Exactly.  That's what the Second Amendment's for.  Just, we, we, people should have guns. 
[02:54:30]  I actually went fishing for the first time.  Like, I want to learn how to hunt and that stuff.  So I finally went.  Wow.  What's going on with you?  Because I've just read too much conspiracy theory.  I'm realizing, I want to have the option that if stuff goes down.  Survival, my friend.  I can disappear into the mountains.  I'm going to go into Big Bear.  I like the way Billy's thinking now.  No, I just really, like, I don't know how to hunt.  I don't know how to fish.  I can't start a fire without a match.  I'm screwed.  Whatever they say.  We are putting microchips in the back of your head.  Okay.  I don't want to do that.  You want oatmeal?  Okay. 
[02:55:00]  You're screwed.  I want to be like those rednecks.  You go into the woods.  You're in that two minutes.  You choke out a yak.  You got them on a spit.  You know what I mean?  That's it.  You want to hunt your own food.  Yeah.  I want to know how to do it.  Like, if any point, if I'm in that avenge me moment.  Yeah.  Avenge me!  Yeah.  If I'm in that moment, I can somehow scale the fence and disappear and actually survive.  Get out.  I'm a big fan of the guys that fish right here in Manhattan.  In the river.  Oh, are you?  In the East River. 
[02:55:30]  The East and the Hudson River.  They are fishing for their supper in this city.  What are they catching in the Hudson River and the East River?  Squeeze those fish out and fill thermometers.  That's a horrible place to fish.  That's a good sign of the economy.  People in Manhattan are fishing.  Fishing in the rivers.  I have noticed, because I take the bike path, that more people are fishing, so you might  be onto something, Bill.  Diddy's flying commercial.  Come on.  How bad are things? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, that's sad for Diddy.  Grounded his jet.  Why?  Because he said fuel is too much.  So now he's got to fly first class.  Oh.  Yeah.  Poor Diddy.  Dude, I dug a little deeper in the conspiracy theory.  On what?  I don't know if I'm afraid to say it on air.  Wow.  That big?  Yeah, I think I found.  I found, you know, four in the morning on YouTube.  I thought I got it all figured out.  Some Illuminati kind of stuff?  Yeah.  What do you got?  So cool.  I don't know.  I just read all this stuff on the Rothschilds family, and like how they-  The candy manufacturers?  I know.  Exactly. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  I don't want to talk about it.  I got like-  Wow.  Reading it.  Really?  I just freaked out reading it.  Yeah.  They kind of-  No, you're going to have to let me in on some of this.  I love-  They made JP Morgan look like a punk.  They worked for him.  No, I mean-  Really?  He worked for them or something.  I was just like, oh my God.  Well, now you got to give us something, because you piqued everyone's interest there.  Well, the rest of it is on my website at- I'm kidding.  Well, they're an international banking family.  Is that true?  Well, on the outside.  What do you got on them, Bill?  Come on. 
[02:57:00]  I don't know.  It's kind of like brand new.  I just- I don't know.  I was just reading it.  It's just they kind of back-  What are they-  If there's a war, they kind of back both sides.  Oh.  And they're-  Yeah.  Profiteer?  Yeah.  Off of a-  And they're never on TV for some reason.  And whenever they talk about the richest people on the planet, they're like, Bill Gates  has $4 million.  They got him on a jet ski.  You know?  And you're like, that son of a bitch.  He's got $4 million.  These guys-  Yeah.  One of them died and on their deathbed, and they were like, how much money do you have?  And he's like, there's not enough zeros for me to even-  And he was just literally like, all the empires that have fell, Roman, all the way back to 
[02:57:30]  the Mongolians, we have all that money.  Wow.  But the thing is, who did he say that to, who was close enough to be on his deathbed-  I have no idea.  Who would blab it and get it on YouTube?  Dude, but you know what's funny about, right before I learned that information, two seconds  before that, I was watching somebody get bit by a cobra.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm just- I'm an idiot.  I don't know.  That's the beauty of the internet, though.  Come on.  No, there's a great video on there.  I think it's literally called Dumbass Gets Bit by Cobra. 
[02:58:00]  So the- how intense it is, because you know he's going to get bit.  Yeah, yeah, the anticipation.  But it's literally like the 11th strike before he gets hit.  So by the time he finally gets bit, like my knees were up in my chest, I'm like, dude,  what are you doing?  Dude.  Have you seen the piranhas ripping apart the mouse yet?  No.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Oh, wow.  The little white mouse is swimming, swimming for his life in a tank.  He's doing strokes like Michael Phelps back and forth.  Oh, he's trying.  Oh, he's rocking the swim.  The piranha just start nibbling at him a little, and then they just start, whop. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, my God.  Just disemboweling the mouse in the water.  Yeah.  I saw one of these guys caught a cobra, and they put a rat in there.  And this rat did so well, like they should have let it live.  It was almost like, you know, survive three rounds with the champ.  Yeah.  You win some cigars.  This thing was literally, every time it would go to strike him, he would jump up and over.  You could see the snake was getting tired and getting annoyed.  And then the people put it in, started tapping the glass.  They tipped the tank off.  Oh, yeah.  It was totally cheating.  Yeah, it was bogus. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, that's not good.  You let the rat go at that point.  Hey, are you checking out the political process bill?  I can't believe it.  The press convention, we're watching, and we're just laughing our asses off, because there's  just nothing but lies going on on TV.  Oh, it's brutal.  Well, once I saw Hillary Clinton, I just realized that's why I couldn't vote for her.  It just hurt the way she talks.  The next president of the United States.  We've been doing the act-act with her for many, many years.  A man who is qualified to be the president of the United States. 
[02:59:30]  She turns into Mars Attacks' alien.  She's horrid.  She picked a good pantsuit, though.  You've got to give it to her.  The orange one was the right choice, because there was a picture where they had a guy with  five different pantsuits to see which one would look good on set.  And she picked the good one, the orange one.  She pulls it up too high over her bun.  She looks like Oliver Hardy.  She's awful.  She's in a Buster Keaton movie.  She should come out in that fast motion, like, walking. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Hello.  Oh, little ragtime piano.  Yeah, we were watching the convention last night, and it's just, like Ove said, just a  bunch of liars.  They have, you know, Biden and Hillary just talking, smack-talking Obama during the primaries  when they were all hating each other.  Oh, yeah.  And Jimmy brought up a good point.  And he goes, don't these people realize there's tape?  That they taped them doing this? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  To play it later?  Biden is saying, you know.  They're like junkies.  Yeah.  Hey, can I stay at your place?  And they're like, all right.  And then you go to work, and they sell your TV.  I'll deal with that later.  When he comes home, it's once I've got my smack now, you know?  No, but they all do that.  You don't remember George Bush Sr., when he was running against Reagan?  He's like, voodoo economics.  Voodoo economics.  Yeah.  And then, like, two months later, he's like, this guy's great.  Yeah.  It's good.  I like that voodoo economics.  Yeah.  I meant voodoo in a good way. 
[03:01:00]  It's all just crap in the end.  It really is just crap.  Yeah, but Obama's definitely got some momentum with this little party that they throw.  But the Republicans get their last ups.  They get to get their convention in.  When do they go to their convention?  In a week?  When the hell is that, Stuntbrain?  Oh, next week.  Next week.  McCain's announcing his vice president tomorrow, I think.  Yes.  And who do you think that's going to be?  Stuntbrain?  You did so well picking Obama's vice president, saying, there's no way it's going to be Joe Biden. 
[03:01:30]  You could have been more off.  We said, oh, white guy.  You went with lesbian.  A woman from the Midwest.  Yeah, I went with Catherine Sebelius.  I was wrong on that one.  But there are three candidates we're down to.  Mitt Romney, who would be the guy I would like to see in there with him.  But Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, who would be key to combating the fight that Biden's going to give him in that critical state.  Didn't Ridge have a little controversy over something? 
[03:02:00]  They all have a little bit of controversy.  And he is pro-choice.  So that's going to give him the space to the pro-life.  Well, that might get in the way of the core lunatic.  But they're saying that could help out in the battleground states.  And there was talk of Pawlenty, this governor Pawlenty, who's kind of a lukewarm guy.  Sounds too Italian.  No way.  I think it's going to be Ridge.  I'd go Mitt Romney.  Then I'm going Romney.  I'd like it to be Romney.  I'm going Romney.  Stump Brain says Ridge.  I'm saying Romney.  Why don't they just have a kid? 
[03:02:30]  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Why don't they have these guys just fight it out in a cage match or something?  A cage match.  Make it fun.  What do you think of Brett Favre on the Jets there, Bill?  I know you're a huge Pats fan.  It's going to be one way or the other.  He's either going to have the natural season or it's going to be Joe Namath on the Rams.  A lot of excitement here in New York.  Joe Namath on the Rams.  Yeah, that's what we were.  A lot of excitement here in New York.  But we think basically that he's going to have two okay years for the Jets.  And then he goes back to Green Bay as a hero and goes into the Hall of Fame as a Packer. 
[03:03:00]  We've seen this play out so many times over the years with other guys.  He had that great last season, but the previous three were pretty rocky.  They weren't that great, right?  Yeah, he was throwing like six.  Well, what's up with Brady?  He hasn't really practiced or anything.  He's still nursing that ankle of his that they are trying to say isn't a problem.  Dude, I can't even watch.  I only watch the game, so I don't watch any of the pregame just because every sports show  has turned into two guys screaming at each other.  You know what I mean?  And they always have opposite opinions. 
[03:03:30]  And it's always so ridiculous.  I can't watch it.  It's just become.  I don't know.  I think his ankle is a little swollen.  How could you say that?  This is a guy.  He's got three rings.  He's got too much to lose.  They just start.  It's like, really?  You can bring up water polo.  They're flipping out.  The chlorine balance was off in the pool.  How do you play with a pH like that?  And they get their, I literally think they had PTI came on. 
[03:04:00]  And those guys had a natural friendship and a natural organic arguing.  And then they were like, people like this.  They're watching this.  You go for it.  Just fight.  Everybody yell.  Everybody yell at each other.  So I can't.  Oh, yeah.  I can't watch it.  They don't agree.  That would be kind of fun, though.  I think the Jets got it locked.  Yeah, me too.  Good point.  Next.  Nothing.  I'm going to have to agree with you on that one, Jimmy.  28 more minutes.  Dot, dot, dot.  Commercial. 
[03:04:30]  Did you watch the Olympics?  Oh, yeah.  I was totally into it.  Yeah, right?  I thought, you know, what was hilarious was the opening ceremony.  It was like the classic white guy statement.  They were like, you know, when they came out, they were playing those drums.  And they were going nuts and everything.  And they were kind of yelling.  It was awesome.  Got you all amped up for the games.  And then I felt like I was at a Kitaro concert.  But well, they literally were going like, you know, all the Kitaro fans out there.  That's pretty good, actually.  I kind of blew by that.  I don't even know what that is.  It's OK.  It's new age.  He's the master of new age.  And all right. 
[03:05:00]  Anyway, let me try to get the momentum going here again.  Someone out there is going to go.  I got it.  Oh, yeah.  But he literally goes like, you know, because they're sitting there slamming the drums and  yelling and stuff.  And he literally goes, you know, an amazing performance here for the opening of the games.  And I got to admit, a little bit intimidating.  I'm like, that is just a classic.  I'm in another country.  I'm used to being around all white people.  And now these guys are getting excited.  The natives are getting restless.  That's like that British, you know, with the safari hat.  Yeah.  You know, I really want to blame you for that one because you kind of stopped the momentum 
[03:05:30]  in the beginning.  But I think that was great.  I'm sorry.  I'm actually.  Even though you're kidding, I'm actually like thinking like I'm actually thinking about  your point.  And it's actually not a bad point.  It's like every time you see video of non-whites with drums, the guy's being cooked alive.  So exactly.  Yeah.  It's the Shaka Zulu moment.  Shaka Zulu.  I have to explain something else.  There is a distraction going on.  I blew it with the Kitaro.  Absolutely.  I'll take full credit.  But also the phones are ridiculous.  They're all lit going nuts. 
[03:06:00]  And the instant feedback is flying by at this point.  You can't even read them because XM went down.  So people are freaking the F out.  Yeah.  Apparently.  That's what I saw.  So as I was trying to listen to you, then I'm seeing what the hell is going on.  You know, are we still on the air anywhere?  But I guess we are on the regular radio, but not on the satellite.  So I do apologize to you.  No, it's all right.  You want to take a quick break?  We'll regroup and we'll continue.  Hey, this is JBL.  John Bradshaw Layfield from the WWE.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:06:30]  The virus.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst.  The lack of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  It's awful.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program.  I'm Jim Norton and Opie's chewing.  And Anthony's looking at a naked 18-year-old.  We have the great Bill Burr in the studio.  No.  In town from California.  I'm going to see what Anthony's looking at. 
[03:07:00]  Look.  There's no one naked on the screen at all.  There's just...  There's no one naked on the yellow.  Wow.  What is that?  That is a filthy whore.  Filthy whore.  In a good way.  In a good way.  My ass feels really good since I've been doing the elliptical machine.  I actually like touching my own ass now.  Do you?  Yeah.  I like cupping it.  It's got like a plumpness to it.  It never had.  Stop being a braggart. 
[03:07:30]  I'm getting some physical therapy.  And they had to point out that I have an atrophied butt, Bill Burr.  Atrophied?  Yeah.  You've missed a lot.  Yeah.  How did your ass become atrophied?  You're sitting here doing radio every day?  I went in because I have a bad shoulder.  I got a torn tendon.  So I'm going the physical therapy route.  And they're beating the crap out of me.  And then they decided they were comfortable enough with me to tell me what else is wrong with my body.  Like I was a sorority girl.  And they had laser pointers. 
[03:08:00]  Like this is not what I signed up for.  But I learned I got an atrophied butt that they're working on.  Is it reversible?  Yeah, it is.  Just one cheek, though, right?  Yeah, one cheek.  Because of two herniated discs.  So your ass, when something's atrophied, doesn't the muscle shrivel up?  Do you have one shriveled up butt cheek?  I want to see his ass so bad.  It looks like an old orange.  You know what one's such depressing in him?  It's coming along nicely, though, these things. 
[03:08:30]  Whatever.  That's what happens when you go to the doctor, man.  And they find other stuff.  It's like taking your car into the mechanic.  No kidding.  Man, you are so right.  That's why guys don't go to the doctor.  We don't want to know.  Isn't it better not to know?  Well.  Oh, yeah.  I know they could, like.  Just drop.  Not really, but.  I know they could, like.  You put a roast beef sandwich just out of nowhere.  You just drop.  That's it.  Done.  That's the way to go, though, right?  Yeah, nice and quick.  Not knowing instead of, like, the doctor telling you, oh, boy.  I'll give you eight months.  You better sit down. 
[03:09:00]  We found something.  Yeah, it gives you eight months.  Now you've got to take up sailing and all this other crap you wanted to do.  I couldn't pay the bill, so he gave me another two.  You're better off going, though.  Like, I went.  I'm 40 now.  I went to get something done, and I asked for a certain kind of testing for a cancer.  And she said, well, you're not 50, so they might charge.  I'm like, I don't care.  I'll pay for it.  I'll have a test.  Yeah, they're always so, like, quick to throw the money thing at you.  Well, the insurance isn't going to.  Do it. 
[03:09:30]  Just do it.  My health.  Do it.  Pay.  I got a credit card.  Insurance is the biggest scam ever.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  You're paying for protection.  I think the Rothschild's running the whole insurance, every insurance company.  No, they finance them.  Oh, they finance them.  They finance everybody.  Okay.  Jimmy and I go to this really hot Russian doctor, though.  She actually said to me that I'm a fine specimen.  And then she kind of leans over with her little skirt, and she's got cleavage showing in her bra to write down the stats. 
[03:10:00]  And an accent.  I was ready to be part of a portal, I think.  Like, where it starts at a doctor's office, right?  She's hot for a doctor, yeah.  I mean, like, if I saw her on the street, I would think she's just an average lady.  For an MD, she's sexy.  But she has no problem showing your little bra with the blouse button, the unbuttoned one too low.  Yeah, I always look at the rubber gloves.  I'm like, you want to put them on?  I mean, I'm here.  Yeah, why not?  Let's get everything checked while we're at it, Doc, huh?  Well, I was actually psyched. 
[03:10:30]  I turned 40 in June, and for some reason, for white males, they put off that whole ass exam to now when you're 50.  So I'm like, oh, great.  It's perfect.  Gee, that sucks.  The colonoscopy?  No, wait.  Are you talking the pipe or just the quick prostate?  In my head, I was like, I don't have to have anything examined.  The prostate check?  Have you had the prostate check?  Nope.  Oh, boy.  See, I went in.  I ate plenty of fruit.  And I had to do that. 
[03:11:00]  I had to get the prostate check for a day checkup.  I'm like, I don't know.  No.  I went in for strep throat, and I got the strep throat.  Did the guy just put his finger in there?  I told the story many times.  I had to change doctors because I think something's going on with this one.  He's done that twice, and I didn't go in for that.  He did it again?  Twice.  And you let him?  That's your fault.  Yeah.  Fool me once, J.  Yeah, well. 
[03:11:30]  I went to our doctor, and I got my prostate because I tinkle a lot.  So I'm like, there's got to be something wrong with my bladder or my prostate.  There's something wrong.  And I had them both sonogrammed.  Sonogrammed?  Yeah, it's like where they make you drink a lot of water.  And it's like a 20-minute procedure where she videos all the inside of it, and they press  down on you, and you have to go to the bathroom.  It's awful.  But she's like, yeah, it's normal size.  No lumps on it.  Fun story.  Are you a hypochondriac? 
[03:12:00]  I'm not that bad.  No.  I think you just like that whole environment.  It reminds me of one of those jerk shops.  It's kind of legal.  You go in there.  Like you said, there's the gloves.  Yeah, it's a good den.  There's that smell of alcohol in there.  If Jimmy had kids, he'd be one of those that have that Munchausen syndrome by proxy or something  where you keep your kids sick just to be in the hospital.  What is that called?  It's like Munchausen syndrome by proxy.  And it's usually a mother, like 99% of the times. 
[03:12:30]  It's rarely ever the father.  The mother keeps their child sick to get attention for themselves.  So they build up a relationship with the doctors, the nurses.  They love the sympathy that they get, so they keep their child sick by giving them the poison  in their food.  But I thought they'd kill them, don't they?  That happens eventually.  A kid can only be that sick so long before they die.  But, yeah, it's such a selfish thing. 
[03:13:00]  And they gave it some name.  I don't know why it's Munchausen syndrome.  Tastes like almonds.  Yeah.  That was always good.  I liked it in Sixth Sense when that girl was just throwing up in front of the poor little  petrified kid.  And they get the video.  Yeah, the videotape.  Hey, give it to the father.  He watches it.  And you actually see the wife pouring, like, Drano into the kid's soup.  She was doing a terrible puppet show.  She deserved it. 
[03:13:30]  It was an awful puppet show.  That puppet show stunk.  I'm sick.  Shut up.  I'm some poison, idiot.  You rotten, bad puppeteer.  That is a sick disorder, man.  That's Misha Barton.  That's twisted.  Yeah.  There are, yeah, a bunch of those.  I like watching those stupid crime shows on A&E and stuff.  They always kind of, she had Munchausen syndrome by proxy.  This is a disease that women get when blah, blah, blah.  You know where the 11th child got sick?  Yeah, yeah.  People started asking questions. 
[03:14:00]  Really?  11 kids.  You know where the name comes from?  Uh, Baron von Munchausen.  Stunt brain, you're fired.  We don't need you anymore.  All right.  He came up with it on his own.  You're out.  Sorry.  You're right.  Which was a movie, uh, Monty Python put out.  No, I just knew that.  Ted Munchausen.  He was a...  Ted...  I'm Ted Munchausen.  My baby's sick.  Help. 
[03:14:30]  He's got the sniffles.  He fell down the steps again.  Ted Munchausen.  Oh, no.  My kids are dead.  Give me a hug and some flowers.  Every character he does now is named Ted.  Yeah, just go with it, Bill.  Just, just, yeah.  Same voice, everything.  I was literally sitting here going, I didn't see that one.  I didn't see that Monty Python.  Ted has been many things on this show in recent months.  Yeah, he was a famous liar, this barren guy. 
[03:15:00]  Hey, it's a very sad day, Ant.  Why?  Why?  Well, we lost, uh, Del Martin.  Where'd he go?  She.  Well...  Where'd she go?  You guys remember who Del Martin is?  Think?  I just...  Let me think.  Jimmy knows.  I do.  I read the story.  It's Economist.  Famous Economist.  Oh, yeah, probably.  We did easily an hour on Del Martin.  Did we?  Easily.  That movie critic who wears the bow tie and has the afro?  That guy?  Gene Shalott.  Gene Shalott, yeah.  Del Martin was that old bra that got married to the... 
[03:15:30]  Oh, her old lesbian...  Wow, she's a widow already?  She just got married.  They made marriage legal in San Francisco.  She was the first, one of the first to take the plunge, if not the first.  Del Martin was something like 87, and her partner was whatever, pretty much the same age.  And I think Del Martin was the one in the wheelchair when they were getting married?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, well...  And she passed away.  Yeah, I actually...  Did she have money?  Huh?  Did she have a lot of money?  She was just like this major lesbian activist. 
[03:16:00]  Yes.  They think her partner killed her.  It was Muncher Syndrome.  Muncher...  I actually got a little choked up reading the story.  It was sad.  It was sad.  It was awful.  Why stop?  We love Del Martin.  Remember?  Do we?  Remember that old bit with lesbians?  Come on out.  Lesbians, yes.  Yeah, lesbian rights pioneer Del Martin dies at 87. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, we...  It's gotta be way easier to come out as a lesbian, because, like, more people understand.  Especially at that age.  Oof.  I was gonna criticize you.  What are they doing?  You know they're not having fun lesbian sex or anything.  They're just...  They're really just in love with each other.  They have been for years.  Is that Del's lady with the dark...  She looks like Ralph Cramden with glasses?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Yeah, that was... 
[03:17:00]  What's her name?  Phyllis.  Phyllis Lyon.  Phyllis was awful.  Yeah, Phyllis was...  And then the other one?  Not a looker.  I thought that was Billie Jean King.  Oh, Phyllis is terrible.  Yeah.  Well, we lost Del.  We always goof, though, that in the old days, when they had to hide it, like, the media  and just people, newsreels, they just never understood gays.  Right.  So they would just be like, and these two ladies are quite the lookers.  Yes, gentlemen. 
[03:17:30]  Any gentlemen callers for these two?  They're always out together.  So they'll need two gentlemen to take them out.  Not understanding, they don't want guys.  They just didn't want to acknowledge it back then.  And there was the old gay couple, the guys.  It's like, hey, ladies, these men aren't taken.  They're like frolicking in a pool with a beach ball.  Gus and Elmo.  Gus and Elmo?  Elmer.  Elmer.  Gus and Elmer.  That was his name.  Gus and Elmer. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Yes, they're fresh back from the wall and looking for action.  Are they?  You know what's funny back then?  Every guy who was in shape, like, they had no muscles.  They just had that I'm in seventh grade torso.  You notice that?  Like, being in shape back in the day just meant you weren't fat.  Right.  You could be barrel, like, barrel-like or something.  Yeah, if you watch, like, Ben-Hur and all of them, they have just these straight arms.  There's no tricep or body.  It's like skin hanging on the bone, but they're not fat.  They all weigh, like, 140 pounds.  Yeah.  And you just thrust your chest out. 
[03:18:30]  It was like, yeah, watching, like, Tony Curtis in Spartacus.  Yeah.  It's like, I'm a gladiator.  My name's Spartacus.  And he just, he looked like crap.  And then nowadays, you turn on the 300 and go, Jesus Christ.  How do you get a body like that?  Dude, it's a whole group of guys that had nothing but abs.  Dude, Ben Stiller is shredded in comedy.  Yeah, what the hell is that about?  Meet the parents.  He jumps in the pool.  He's got an eight-pack.  I'm like, really?  Ben Stiller.  To do a comedy?  He was shredded.  I was like, oh, my God.  I got to go to the gym.  Tropic Thunder is shredded. 
[03:19:00]  Judah Ben-Hur with a big barrel chest and a gut.  I'm in great shape.  Are you, Chuck?  Yeah, as long as your chest was out further than your stomach.  Yeah, and they'd suck their gut in when they'd take their shirt off.  They'd suck it in, and it would just look horrible.  Johnny Weissmiller, the guy who played Tarzan.  Tarzan, yeah.  He had his little leaf shorts pulled up beyond his navel.  Remember that?  And he would be sucking it in.  The first guy who played Batman.  Remember him?  Yeah.  The utility belt cranked.  Oh, yeah.  Adam West.  Adam West, yeah.  Yeah, and the stretchy material was all stretched. 
[03:19:30]  And you could see how doughy his stomach was.  Yeah, really have come leaps and bounds from those days.  Yeah, no core strength.  Now it doesn't matter what you're doing.  Everybody's got to be shredded in the movies and TV.  You should see the way people work out in L.A.  I'm telling you, if you want the next big money-making thing, get into hip replacements  and knee replacements.  Really?  They're doing that muscle confusion.  You confuse it, man.  It doesn't have time.  It doesn't have, well, basically, they say if you do the same workout, after a couple, 
[03:20:00]  two, three weeks, your body gets used to it, and it becomes part of it, and you stop  getting results.  So what you do is you confuse it, is you just perpetually have it so, I don't know, just  constantly doing these different exercises.  I was literally on the treadmill.  I'm doing all the old school stuff.  I felt like I should have been wearing like the gray pullover sweatshirt, you know?  Like Jack LaLanne doing calisthenics.  Yeah, and this dude is literally, this is, I swear to God, this is what he's doing.  He would jump up, grab the chin-up bar, he'd do a pull-up, then he'd come down, he does 
[03:20:30]  one jumping jack, drops down into the squat, and then goes into like a push-up, then like  spread his legs, jumped up, and then brought them back together.  Oh, his muscles didn't know what was going on.  And then did a push-up, and then went back, and he did like a set of 30 of those, and  I'm like, shoulders, knee, oh, that's going to be a hit.  And the whole time he's jumping up and landing back down, and the best thing, too, is he was  completely out of shape.  So he just probably watched like that P90X video.  Have you seen that guy where they have all those 40-year-old weird-looking guys who are  shredded and they've lost the elasticity, so it still doesn't look good? 
[03:21:00]  30.  Dude, past 48, it's like, dude, keep your shirt on.  Just keep your shirt on, just as long as it's straight.  You know what I mean?  You'll look fine.  Oh, my God.  That's the confusing muscles.  I don't think the muscles can really be confused like that.  They swear by that crap.  Do they?  I've heard that.  I do the elliptical every day, or most days, but it's like if you jog every day, you still  lose weight.  Of course you do.  People that go out and jog every day, what do you jog sideways and then jog on your 
[03:21:30]  hands?  Go out and run.  Yeah.  That's all you need to do.  I know.  Stop eating like a pig.  If you're working out and eating right, it doesn't matter if your muscles are dazed and  confused.  You'll be fine.  There's no money in that.  No, no.  You've got to have some trainer that's going to tell you, you've got to mix up the muscles.  First of all, don't let your muscles hear this.  We're going to confuse them.  What?  After the workout, you have a homosexual encounter. 
[03:22:00]  You confuse your ass muscles.  What's happening?  Confuse your family.  Exactly.  Your throat is nervous.  He's never done this to me before.  Tastes funny.  We've got a pretty fun story worth playing today.  Bill Burr, by the way, Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I want to go, Bill, but I'm going away this weekend.  You've come out to plenty of my shows.  I know.  It's actually a quick ride from the city until you hop on the New Jersey Transit. 
[03:22:30]  If you're in Manhattan or whatever, you can still go down.  It's a very easy ride to Albany Street and New Brunswick.  You just get off the train literally a block, block and a half.  You're at the club.  It's a three-minute walk.  You know, one night I went to take the train back and I wasn't paying attention.  I have a really bad sense of direction and I got on the train and I went the wrong  way.  I started going down towards Philly.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't realize it until like the fourth or fifth stop.  Oh, my God.  I ended up taking like a $150 cab ride back.  You see Philly's awful skyline.  You're like, wait a minute.  What is this? 
[03:23:00]  No, I ended up in a Denny's.  I ended up stopping.  I sat in a Denny's.  I'm like, what am I going to do?  When's the next train?  The next train's in two hours.  So I ate a Grand Slam breakfast.  Like, what am I going to do?  And the worst time, I don't get recognized that much.  And, of course, the waiter's like, hey.  I know you.  Yeah, you're that comedian guy.  What are you doing here?  It was like four in the morning.  I'm like, oh, I got on the train going the wrong way.  Hey, that's a funny joke.  You're going to put it in your act?  No, like any sort of shine that he saw of me was just completely gone. 
[03:23:30]  I was just a complete loser.  I don't talk about it.  He'll talk about us in his routine.  Hey, watch out what you say to him.  He's on the radio.  It'll end up on his show.  Hey, I bet this is on his show tomorrow.  No, it won't be.  This is the most boring thing that's ever happened to me.  Are you going to use this?  I know you're going to use this.  You're going to use it, and they always got to grab a friend over.  Look out what you say now, because it'll end up in his act.  I'm going to use this instead of counting sheep, you dullard.  Yeah, because it's always just such captivating, compelling stuff that they're talking about. 
[03:24:00]  It usually ends with 23 back slaps.  Yeah.  All right, all right.  You don't care, right, Ant?  Slap, slap.  No, you shouldn't get away from me.  Kill you.  Keep listening, so I make the money, but get away from me.  Get away from me.  Buy all the paraphernalia, but get away from me.  Thank you.  I hate when they come up to you, and they'll compliment you, and you go, hey, I really like  your act.  You know, and they'll, like, can I get a picture?  I mean, I ain't gay or nothing.  Like, I know this is gay.  It's like, all right, just ask for the picture.  Stop justifying yourself.  Let's do it. 
[03:24:30]  Now you made it awkward.  Do I have to really bail you out emotionally?  Take the picture and go away.  Scumbag.  Bill, you get back to Boston?  I haven't been back there in a minute.  I was going to be, I'm actually doing a college coming up, UMass Amherst with Charlie Murphy  in a couple weeks, but I was scheduled to come back, but the Comic Connection moved recently.  I don't know where they are.  They moved to a theater.  It's like a theater.  Yeah, I'm doing it in, I think, November.  It's something.  Doesn't your family miss you up there, though?  Uh, yeah, I guess so. 
[03:25:00]  Hope so.  I don't, uh, I was there for Christmas.  I think this is the first Christmas I'm not going back.  I just can't.  I can't at 40 go back, unmarried, no kids, and just sitting there, just, you know, my nephew's  like 27, you know?  I just can't, I can't do it.  At some point, I got to create my own lonely Christmas.  Bill, you got to bring a guy friend.  As a goof, you got to bring an effeminate guy friend. 
[03:25:30]  Just say, that's my roommate.  Oh, God.  Get your whole family miserable.  As a goof, bring-  And never address it.  Don't address it.  No, just say, that's my buddy.  He doesn't have any place to go.  And then just have it be like a really subtle, obvious thing, like the little looks you give  each other.  Yeah.  Oh, like, yeah, you're looking to go.  And Brian-  Just until someone notices, and then look away.  Oh.  No, and any time I go to tell a story, it'll be like, and Brian, and I'll like squeeze  his hand.  That's what's on the table.  Brian here.  Where's four arms?  He has four arms good. 
[03:26:00]  How bad would that be?  How nervous would your family get, like, start looking around?  What the hell?  Your dad would understand, right, Bill?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  He totally wouldn't have a problem.  A lot of tolerance there for that kind of thing?  No, it's not like he's homophoid, but, like, yeah, he's a very emotional guy.  He would end up screaming about it at some point during the night.  Yeah.  Like, in what way?  For Christ's sake, he's gay!  Well, what do you think they're in the same room for? 
[03:26:30]  My dad is the funniest dude ever.  He gets so worked up, he has no idea that he's giving away the whole playbook.  I didn't say that.  Dad, you screamed it at four in the morning.  He'd be in the next...  Oh, Christ, I'm tired.  That's his excuse for everything.  All right, so I'm working too many hours.  Oh, Christ.  All right, let's play this here.  Dude, what a great...  You know how funny that would be, like, as a sketch or something?  Like, you know, Tom Green used to do weird stuff at his parents' house? 
[03:27:00]  That would be a great...  Yeah.  You bring a camera and just say that you and Brian are filming it just so you have it,  and they have no idea that you just goof...  Oh, then the great thing with the cameras, and they couldn't...  They'd be afraid to actually ask, so you could have the awkwardness even longer.  Oh, yeah.  They don't know what's going on TV.  What are you doing?  What are you...  I don't want to...  Could you turn the cameras off?  Are you sucking his...  No, but the guy has to be, like, really...  Play it, like, really subtly, like that guy in Dog Day Afternoon.  Oh, right.  You know he's gay.  It's because he has his hand on his chest the entire time. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah, Leon.  Oh, Leon.  Yeah.  And he had this stupid robe, and the funny part is he's like, hey, you're a bunch of crazy  people, and the cops are snickering behind him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually died recently, the real Leon Shermer.  I forget what...  He died of AIDS.  He became a woman.  Really?  He did get his operation.  Yeah.  Sonny Wartick is now dead.  Who saw that coming?  Wow.  Yeah, he did get his operation, and he eventually died.  Poor guy.  Wait, I wrecked the flow.  No, no.  No, it's good.  Good info.  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you. 
[03:28:00]  That's great.  Poor Sal.  They're saying there's two homosexuals.  Stupid Sal with his machine gun.  All he wanted to do was murder women in a bank.  Did that actor ever get to play the guy?  He's always like the sad sack dude on the side who never quite knows what's going on.  John Cazale.  He was in The Godfather.  He was Fredo.  He was in The Deer Hunter.  He was in some of the biggest movies ever.  Always the schlep guy.  He died of old pudding head disease, too.  Yeah, cancer.  Married to Meryl Streep. 
[03:28:30]  No.  Yeah, I believe he was, John.  Really?  Stop.  Am I wrong?  Really?  We're going to have to look that up there, John.  Please, Stunt Brain, look it up.  You're humiliating me.  Come on, Stunt Brain.  Dude, he's dead.  John Cazale, he died many years ago.  I'm getting so old.  When I see people like that, to him, to me, he's 50.  He was engaged in my own school.  Oh, he's engaged.  Okay.  Was, yeah.  She broke it off.  Yeah.  He would have been 73 if he was still alive.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jesus.  We've got a quick little story here for everybody.  A man from Moline is now charged with holding five people hostage in Fort Madison, Iowa. 
[03:29:00]  He was caught when he sent two of his alleged victims on a beer run.  Police say it started when 33-year-old Jason Slagle pulled a knife during an argument with another man on Tuesday night, told the other people in the room that they were not allowed to leave.  Eventually, Slagle got thirsty, sent two of those hostages for beer, who then called police, and they came to the rescue. 
[03:29:30]  Did he really hold five people hostage with a knife?  That's pretty stupid.  I'm not a tough guy, but if there's five of us and you have a knife, you're in trouble.  We're going to give it a shot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm not the guy who has, like, the knife on me.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  That's when you give him the Lawrence Taylor blind side to the back and cause him to fumble.  What a bad hostage taker.  Go get me some beer, and you better come back, or I'll, what, cut one of us?  Shut up. 
[03:30:00]  It's good to know we have XM listeners.  We can't go to the phones because they're all calling to say we're not on the air, right?  Is that what they're all calling about?  Can we get the word out through the pad data like they know?  Stop calling.  They're working on it.  It's because I brought up the Rothschilds.  Do you know what I said?  I brought them up.  Ah.  Cut to all communications.  I tried to tell you.  I only wanted to talk to you during break.  They're behind the merger, man.  I'm telling you.  All right, we're going to break. 
[03:30:30]  Illuminati stuff.  Yeah.  That's scary.  That's all I think about now is the Illuminati.  Just think that they're running things, and this is all a facade.  Everything else, the government, everything's a big facade just to keep everybody.  It's like the Matrix.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all looking at pictures of Britney Spears' vagina.  Yeah.  We have no idea of anything else.  Nothing else.  We're captivated by that.  They throw distractions at us at perfect times.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  First I came in here.  Hey, did you see the new Mets stadium?  Yeah, see? 
[03:31:00]  Hey.  Rothschild.  But would they allow the internet to actually, now they're starting to be revealed, all this  talk, the books about the Illuminati, would they allow all this information?  If they were so good to...  No, they're shutting it down.  But in 2012, they're coming out with like the internet too, and it's basically going to  be like glorified basic cable.  Seriously, you're going to have to pay for extra, I don't know, websites.  How is that going to work?  Is this true?  Yeah.  It's being talked about, yeah.  No, it isn't being talked about.  It's actually a law.  It's going to be happening. 
[03:31:30]  I don't think that's...  How the hell can that happen?  Yeah.  If you get a new passport, there's a little microchip in it now.  Really?  Yeah.  They're going to...  Basically, they're starting with dogs.  They're putting in dogs.  Yeah.  And they're going to be like...  So unattractive women have a passport.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Microchip.  No, they're going to start with the dogs.  You know, what if Fido gets lost?  They'll have a couple of those stories on TV, and then they were able to find him, and  the dog was okay, and everybody excited.  Then they'll start a panic about your kids getting abducted, so they'll give them some  sort of wristband to wear, and then eventually they'll slowly... 
[03:32:00]  There's a commercial.  No, it's already in their shoes.  You see the commercial on television?  Yeah.  Where the mother is in a park, and she starts to panic, and she's like saying her kid's name,  like, Kevin, Kevin, or something, and she pulls this thing out of her purse that's  going beep, beep, like in Aliens, when they're looking for the aliens, and it's beeping, and  she sees a little dot, and she follows it, and there's her son, because he's got some  kind of chip on him, she can find it, and then it was for Duracell batteries, because  you know, she only depends on Duracell to find her kid. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, they're slowly, gradually getting...  It's like cloning.  They're not just going to clone a guy.  Hey, we got another Dick Cheney.  This one's got a good heart, huh?  It's going to freak everybody out.  They start small.  They start with like a goat or a squirrel.  Oh, it's adorable.  And they'll gradually work their way up, so eventually, probably by the end of my lifetime,  it'll be mandatory.  Every baby that is owned, right between their eyes, they're going to have this big chip.  And all your information is going to be on it, and that way, then they got you.  If you mess with the deal, they just turn your chip off. 
[03:33:00]  Wow.  You hear about Andy?  They turned his chip off.  Turned his chip off.  Then you're out in the street in your bathrobe with all your pistols.  Chipless.  And that's why you're fishing and learning how to hunt.  That's how I am doing it, yeah.  They're not going to get you.  Not getting me.  I caught a striped bass.  I know what I'm doing.  What's this charge for internet thing?  That bugs me.  I won't like that at all.  Who's going to do it?  Well, the thing I love about all this stuff is we don't get to vote on any of it. 
[03:33:30]  We don't get to vote on any of it.  They just come up with these laws.  Oh, yeah, by the way, who's complaining about the internet right now?  I'm not.  I love it.  No, it's great.  I like having everything available.  Well, you can kiss that goodbye in a couple years, sir.  Because they can't tax it.  They're not making any money.  These scumbags are losing money on the phone bill or all these other ways that people are  communicating because of emails.  They're losing postage because people are not just mailing letters anymore.  No, but the big thing is you lose control of people.  You have to be able to control the information that they see.  That way, the lie matches up with the information and you're able to continue on. 
[03:34:00]  But if people can kind of bounce around, then you get all these other guys, like Infowar  guys, like them saying all that stuff, like, hey, here's another side of the argument.  So what they, you know, they'll gradually funnel it in.  Too much information is being made available to people, which informs them.  And an informed people is dangerous to any government.  There's some old white guy sitting in a castle right now.  There's too much information, I think.  Well, out over there, we must crush it. 
[03:34:30]  Grandfather Rothschild.  Just swimming in gold.  What do you do with all that money?  I think they just roll around.  Like those coins, putting it under their armpits.  Oh, it's cold.  He's actually Sir Theodore Rothschild.  People are talking about us.  Let's lock up the internet.  Theodore.  Theodore.  I think we've got to step aside for a few minutes. 
[03:35:00]  Hey, this is Sean William Scott.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's really good to see Bill Burr.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bill hanging with us today.  Jimmy's got a little gift in his hands.  Yes.  Eric's dad.  You rock's dad.  Thank you for my shirt. 
[03:35:30]  I guess it was a birthday gift.  I can't say the name of it on the air.  Why?  Because it's a rum.  It's called Premium Rum.  In the Cayman Islands.  And I guess the guy's name is Dick.  Richard.  Richard.  Yeah, but his name is Dick.  It's not Ted?  No, it's not Ted the rum guy.  His name is Dick.  And he's a big black guy.  Yeah.  So it's called, you know, Big Black Dick. 
[03:36:00]  It's a description of this man.  Yeah.  And that's the name of the rum.  Yeah, it says Big Black and then his name.  Yeah.  If there's any problem.  Big Black Richard.  Right.  Johnson.  Are you going to wear that shirt, Jimmy?  What's that?  I have to see if it fits.  I'll give it a shot.  You like the shirt, Jimmy?  Yeah.  And that came from where?  He rocks dead.  Oh.  The Nagel family.  Are you going to wear it as a top when you go to sleep, Jimmy?  Sending you gifts?  For what?  It was my birthday. 
[03:36:30]  They probably didn't know it was my birthday.  I don't think I've ever gotten anything from a Nagel for my birthday.  Why would you?  Why would you?  Because you don't talk about your birthday on the air.  Yes, I do.  We had a party.  Remember?  There were tanks and stuff up on the walls.  Were there?  And army helmets.  Were there?  Yeah.  Are you sure?  You had a G.I. Joe-themed party?  Yeah.  It was like an army party.  And you can hear us, by the way.  Also, AOL Radio is such a great, smart thing.  AOL?  We are back up. 
[03:37:00]  So you can hear us also on AOL, like on your iPhone.  You can actually do the application and listen to the entire radio show on your iPhone anywhere in the country.  It's amazing.  It's so easy.  You might want to write that down.  I love the iPhone and the apps that they have on there.  You just sounded like Hillary Clinton.  I love the iPhone and all of its apps.  I have eye cankles.  It's wonderful.  A nap is a nap.  See, I could do this. 
[03:37:30]  I could just pop that on, and then I wait a little bit until it buffers.  It's a rum.  Wow.  That's the iPhone.  He's listening to it on his iPhone.  This is that fast.  I'm listening.  I guess the guy's name is Dick.  See, I'm listening to the show on that.  And I can also go to my favorites.  And what do I have marked?  I got KROQ in L.A.  I got BCN.  I got 1010 Winds in my favorites. 
[03:38:00]  And then there's plenty of other stations I could go to.  This is ridiculous.  They are getting to the point now where – and this phone, my iPhone, plugs in in my Mustang.  And I can plug it right into my stereo system so I can run it right from there.  So it's not like I got to pick up the actual iPhone.  I just leave it there.  I can listen to stations all over the country.  You should let people know, too.  The quality is much better.  Oh, yeah, no, you were listening through the iPhone speaker at full volume.  So, please, it sounds perfect.  Yeah, it sounds perfect through a headphone. 
[03:38:30]  I don't want to trump you with the technology.  Oh, what are you doing?  My cell phone.  Oh, look at that.  Why does it have an antenna?  They got rid of that five years ago there, Phil.  Wow.  The big antenna thing.  You know what?  I have the keypad, too, where if I want to hit, like, the letter Y, I got to press it, like, 19 times.  Jesus.  What year are you in?  No, you know what happened?  What, are you trying to stay off the grid?  No, I can't.  No, I kept buying, every time I would buy an expensive phone, I'd lose it.  So, I'm like, I'm sick of this.  I'm buying one of these little flip-flown, flip-flown, flip-flown, 16-year-old chick phones. 
[03:39:00]  And now I haven't been able to.  16-year-old chick phone.  That's exactly what that is.  I want to stay on a little longer.  But if you have a phone like an iPhone, you try not to lose it, you know?  You pay more attention to it.  And you use it for more things, so you're aware of where it is.  Like that, you use to make phone calls, don't you?  That's about it.  Yes, I use my phone to make phone calls.  Well, this is, we're not, we're past that point now. 
[03:39:30]  Does that vibrate and you put it on your lower back?  Yeah, I do.  We're past the point where a phone is just a phone.  So, it's not just a cell phone anymore.  This is.  This is very condescending.  This is an information center.  If I need to know something, I hit, you know, Safari and I'm on the web instantly.  I'll have you know, I'm friends with Robert Kelly, so he has all the latest technology.  Yeah, he's got all the latest technology that a friggin' marine biologist put in his back  when he was swimming by the ship.  This is why I hate Bob Kelly. 
[03:40:00]  He's still talking about his information or his wireless, like, internet?  Because he's as big as a whale.  I didn't get it for a second.  I'm sorry.  What were you saying?  But no, Bob makes me sick because he goes into character.  Like, he'd be like, you know what, Dad?  I had the Geek Squad come over.  They put in the wireless printer.  I'm around the house.  I'm having my coffee.  Boom, I'm tight.  It's like, shut up.  Oh, yeah, he does the sound effects.  Yeah, you know, tick, tick, tick, tick.  I'm typing.  I'm alone.  I'm on the phone.  I'm like, hey, Dad, shut your mouth.  I want to watch a show. 
[03:40:30]  Bam.  It's on my phone.  Over here.  Boom.  I got the coffee.  Just sitting there.  Check it.  And I'm arguing.  I'm like, you moron.  You moron.  Oh, Jesus, man.  I want to hold Bob's lips.  That's funny.  I want to sink my teeth into his juicy lips.  I want to bite his lips off.  So he runs around like a burn victim forever.  What are you doing, still mink?  Whatever the hell that word means.  When he tries to be ethnic, like he's from some old European.  He said, still mink. 
[03:41:00]  Dude, you're being shmarmy.  Shmarmy.  There's no H in smarmy, you dunch.  Bob was here so I could slap him.  He's probably listening.  Call in, Bob.  When I was riding up in the elevator, Roland was talking about somebody.  I was talking about some girl who looks really old, but you can't really tell.  That's right, she looks young and was trying to say that her boyfriend was ancient, but  it sounded like he was saying Asian. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, really?  He's like Asian, but you couldn't hear him in the elevator, so he's literally looking  at the guy.  Yeah, her boyfriend was Asian, like he had a problem with it.  So everyone in the elevator is thinking that he's like trashing Chinese people or something.  I go, dude, are you saying ancient or Asian?  He's like, Asian.  I would say Asian.  He can't say ancient.  He can't.  He says ancient.  He's right there.  We should bring him in.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you for summing up that awful story I just told you.  No, but Roland, no, no, it's not awful because Roland notoriously has terrible diction. 
[03:42:00]  He's Mexican and he says Mexican.  Mexican.  He's terrible.  Mexican.  Come here, Roland.  Don't be so shy.  He's a sweet, shy boy.  Meet the Mexican.  Greet the Mexican.  Yeah, she came walking in and we were like, nice to see you.  Who's the ancient guy?  What were you saying?  Ancient.  Agent.  What is it?  Ancient.  Say the ancient Mexican.  Ancient.  Ancient Mexican.  The what?  Ancient Mexican.  What's the funny?  A secret ancient man. 
[03:42:30]  He has the diction of like the operator when you call and they try to say words you're not  supposed to say.  The ancient Mexican.  The ancient Mexican.  Mexican.  Ancient Mexican.  Ancient Mexican.  What is it?  But he knows how to book a guest for the show.  You got to get to him on that.  And he does know how to dole out some crap when he's backed into a corner.  He's a jackal.  Yeah, don't push him too far, man.  Yeah.  He seems innocent enough.  Oh, I never saw that side.  Holy Jesus. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, you don't want to see that side.  Dude, he is ruthless.  And I mean ruthless.  Like, he will blurt stuff out that will just make grown men cry.  What does he attack their project?  Anything.  Does he just get failed the most?  No, they're dead dogs.  Things like that.  Anything.  Anything.  He finds a little sensitive spot.  He knows how to dig in.  He'll curse at you.  Use the worst language.  Call your mother things.  He's ruthless.  Whatever it takes.  And he doesn't look like that at all.  That's what surprised us so much. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  He's got that smile where you see all his teeth.  Yeah.  Like when you were a kid and you drew a smiley face.  Roland?  Yeah, just if I get pissed off, I go from zero to a thousand.  You go for the...  And that's how he laughs.  When he gets tickled.  I thought he was trying to do an evil laugh.  And then I go right for the jugular.  He-he-he-he-he-he.  The worst was when he went off on Poe.  Oh, that was beautiful.  Holy... 
[03:44:00]  Oh, you got some of that?  Oh, please.  I'd love to hear that.  I'd like to tickle Roland, but, you know, it's a real laugh, too.  It's a genuine laugh, but it's a soft tickle.  He's a soft boy.  So you just tickle softly and he'll giggle.  But Poe...  The moron.  Exactly.  He tickled Roland, like, too hard.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't let anything go.  You're enjoying this.  He was hurting him.  He grabbed him like that bad guy grabbed Indiana Jones' chest in the Temple of Doom.  He tried to tickle him, like, by ripping his heart out. 
[03:44:30]  Roland had a good one.  What did Roland say?  Poe grabbed me like he grabs his dates.  Oh, Jesus.  He doesn't let anything go, either.  We should add to this discussion.  You have Roland headphones.  This guy holds a grudge.  You got that audio there?  We're making sure it's clean?  He's tickling him like that white dude in the end of The Last Kings of Scotland.  He's got him hung from his ceiling.  God, that was brutal, man.  That's a good movie. 
[03:45:00]  Can't play?  It was pretty good.  Oh, okay.  We can play it.  Oh, goody.  Listen to this.  This is what he did to Master Poe because Master Poe was just trying to tickle him, and he tickled him a little too hard.  Roland has two emotions.  Touching him the same way as Brother did.  How's your dog?  Is it still dead?  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Oh, my God.  I should be in a movie.  My condolences.  Here, boy.  That was my favorite part.  Here, boy.  He goes, how's your dog? 
[03:45:30]  Still dead?  It's like, whoa.  Because the guy's dog just recently had died.  But Master Poe really, really loved his dog.  Oh, I know.  I know people love their pets, but Master Poe takes it to a whole other level.  It's like, how's your dog?  And then he goes, here, boy.  Yeah.  Of course, can you imagine the karate film scene that went through Poe's head?  Oh, forget about it.  Just a spinning back kick to your head.  Sure.  That's what it was.  That would be too quick.  And he doesn't let it go.  No.  You don't like Poe?  No, I don't like it.  And I do like Poe.  But just when I flashback, I don't like him. 
[03:46:00]  When I flashback, what, to Vietnam?  What are you?  My flashbacks.  Yeah, he has tickling flashbacks.  Wake up at three in the morning under a blanket, holding a broom like it's a gun.  Slow motion.  Charlie's not ticklish.  He's got that medieval page laugh.  Yeah.  Hey, Bill's got a new CD out.  What's the name of it again, Bill?  Why do I do this?  It's on iTunes. 
[03:46:30]  Yep.  I mentioned his CD because I noticed on there you had a track about Madonna.  Is it on the extras?  Yeah.  We've been talking about her lately on the show.  What's your problem with Madonna?  Well, this isn't the joke, but lately my problem is it's like, you know,  it gets to the point no matter how good in shape you are, you're still 50.  It's like, we got it.  You have a vagina.  Okay?  How many different ways can you frame it?  I get it.  You shave.  You know what I mean?  Frame it.  I got it.  Just put it away. 
[03:47:00]  It's gross at this point.  It's like-  She's got zero body fat.  She's like just into-  You can tell she just works out all the time for some reason.  You know when a girl gets fake breasts and they have that really bad blue vein that's  on the side?  Right.  Like her whole body looks like that.  Yeah.  She looks like one big fake titty.  And it's-  And a lot of ligaments are showing in her.  Like you can see every joint, she's just got like ligaments showing through because she's 
[03:47:30]  got no body fat.  She's phenomenally, unbelievable shape.  Yeah, but like a thoroughbred's in shape, you know?  It's like-  She looks like the dog, a boxer.  You ever seen like that boxer's legs?  She has like pit bull legs.  I like her back in the old days when she had a little-  A little soft, right?  A little softness to her.  Old chub.  Just a slight chub.  Shooting star.  Long ambition, right up till then.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Before she got those cone breasts, you know? 
[03:48:00]  Before she went with the cones on her breast thing.  I don't mind the in shape thing.  Like, I don't mind like, yeah.  They get set-  Like what we were saying earlier with guys, it's like once you get past a certain age, you  know, put a shirt on.  Yeah.  You know, you look-  Be in shape with the shirt on.  You're in great shape for your age, but it doesn't, you know?  No one wants to see a naked 50-year-old.  Danny opened a picture of her a minute ago.  She looked like the machinist.  She just looks like-  The machinist.  She's terrible.  It really-  It's scary.  I don't mind some ligaments, but she really looks bad.  It almost looks like she has like bicep implants or something, or shoulder implants. 
[03:48:30]  How do you get your shoulders like that?  You know what it is?  Yeah, you have your private chef.  Like, look at her biceps, though.  They're hanging over her elbow.  Yeah, in shape.  That one is, nah.  That's a shredded Ethiopian.  Yeah.  That's the look she's going for.  Her name should be like Doc Pole.  I knew that.  Holy Jesus.  Wow.  It's so cold in the day.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  So cold in the day.  I'm very rarely embarrassed after a joke is so bad.  That was really bad.  I knew what I was trying to say.  Yeah.  Something funny?  I know.  That really was dead center tree, no airbag.  Sneaker laying in the road.  Not a hint of a skid mark.  That was a monumental moment.  Car overturned with the wheel still spinning. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, the engine's still on here.  Dead center tree, you're right.  No airbag, no break marks.  No seat belt.  No seat belt.  Just a bottle of whiskey, and I'm gunning it.  Oh, my God.  Suicide by joke.  That was terrible.  We've got to wrap up this side, but Barack does his big speech tonight, Bill.  Tonight?  Yeah, and he's going to look like he's coming down from the mountain, right?  Is that what that set is? 
[03:50:00]  It's a set.  He's got a set.  It's these columns.  Well, they went to Greece, and they got some ruins, it looks like.  Yeah, they brought some ruins back.  They brought some ruins to Denver for Barack's big speech tonight.  It does look like it's a little pompous, if you ask me, to come out looking like, you know, Apollo.  It's not a good look.  No.  It doesn't.  He should have, like, one of those leaf things, like mercury.  Yeah, yeah.  Around his head, some grape leaves or whatever the hell it is.  And wearing sandals.  What do you think McCain's going to come out? 
[03:50:30]  Come out of a bamboo cage that's underwater?  Just comes out of a knife.  Oh, rats!  Rats, Michael!  Oh, there's no knife in his teeth.  If I can survive that, I can survive the presidency.  I think he should just come out of a mud wall behind, like everyone thinks he's not there.  He opens his eyes.  They're like, what is that?  And it's John McCain walking out of a mud wall.  I didn't even see him.  But they're saying it's the White House?  Yeah.  What?  If you look at this. 
[03:51:00]  It's a little presumptuous.  Oh, they're trying to make it look like the White House.  Are they?  It looks like a ruin.  It looks like a Greek ruins.  It looks like he's trying to...  This is the common man?  He's coming out of the Parthenon?  I mean, stop it.  Is there anything funnier than watching all those politicians calling each other privileged  and this person is...  He's an elitist?  Yeah.  It's like, really, Hillary?  Bilderberg Group?  That isn't a little elitist?  Elitist.  Yeah, she's like one of the biggest elitists on the face of the earth. 
[03:51:30]  Who's ever seen Hillary on a flight, on a commercial flight to L.A.?  She ever been sitting in front of class?  No.  Yeah, there she is walking through the airport, toting her bag behind her.  Yeah.  Rolling her luggage.  Stop.  Like the working man.  Right.  The working man.  I like that, how when Barack announced Biden as his vice president, how they came out  on stage with their jackets off and their sleeves were rolled up, like they're ready  to get to work.  Ready to go to work.  What kind of work are you... 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, what kind of dirty work are they doing?  All right, let's dig some trenches.  We're going to do some plumbing today.  There's no work that they're doing that they need to roll their shirt sleeves up.  Except for taking all the art off the walls of the White House and hanging up the posters  from Good Times.  A bunch of...  You're saying there's going to be J.J. art on the walls?  Those weird paintings that J.J. did?  Oh, I love those ones.  The guy dunking the ball in his arms like three miles long.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  I just picked...  Yeah, if Barack gets in there, I just picture a different kind of White House. 
[03:52:30]  Like I've done a lot of jobs when I was robbing houses.  No, a lot of jobs when I was doing air conditioning work.  I was in a lot of people's houses and a lot of different races.  And I've noticed different things that are in common.  And a lot of African-American families have African art in the house.  That's what I've noticed.  And I can just see a lot of African art on the walls of the White House probably for the first time. 
[03:53:00]  Not probably.  Definitely for the first time ever.  Taking down some of the old paintings of maybe Taft.  One of those war masks.  Yeah, a lot of masks.  Things like that.  Bill, he's very scared of the possibility of Barack being the president.  Not scared?  Yeah, you're scared.  There's a whole other wall of white people behind that.  That's just...  That's just a front?  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, the president and all that, that's just the Illuminati's Caroline in the city.  That's like this sitcom.  They just write the whole thing. 
[03:53:30]  See, I'm...  They just come out and rehearse.  They rehearse.  They rehearse.  They do their blocking on Thursday.  And on Friday, they go out and they give the speech.  They do a table read.  And then they...  We need rewrites.  That's your one-man show, man.  That's great.  Bill Burr, I'm paranoid.  I would love that.  That's good.  That's very funny, man.  What scares me the most is his vulnerability.  And what anything that happens to him might cause.  Because, God forbid, something does happen, like has happened to presidents in the past 
[03:54:00]  that were for a lot of change, very different, rock-in-the-boat kind of a thing.  That doesn't usually bode well for a president.  Because there are people out there with...  Are you subtly trying to goad somebody into doing something?  Would I ever do that?  I'm just commenting on the fact that there are some psychopaths out there.  Can I ask you a question?  What rather thing are any of them?  None of them are talking about getting out of Iraq.  None of them are talking about...  They're just doing the usual.  We're going to get health care.  Well, let me tell you something. 
[03:54:30]  Everybody's going to have donuts.  Middle of the country really doesn't need much more of a reason than skin color to think  that that's radical.  Middle of the country.  Upstate New York.  Well, that's what I mean.  The second you get out of a city.  That too.  The second you leave a city.  It's very easy to scare the hell out of people.  Well, we're going to have to take care of this here.  But because of that, and looking at what happens when police beat a black man or something happens,  he dies in custody.  And could you imagine something like that happening to the president of the United States, the first black president? 
[03:55:00]  He'll be fine.  I think there will be unrest, I say.  Unrest is how I put it.  This is what you're hoping for.  Why would I hope for that?  Because you have issues.  I don't have issues.  You do have issues.  You have a gun collection.  I don't have issues.  Oh, I just bought another one the other day.  It's still at the store.  What is it?  It's a Sig 223.  Oh, I thought you were going to tell the same story you did a while ago. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, no, no.  It's brand new.  Remember that you already said you bought a new pistol.  I bought a Colt.  Yeah, a pistol.  But now you got another.  No, now I bought another rifle.  Rifle.  It's, yeah.  What video game was this one from?  This one wasn't from one.  I was in the gun store, and I looked at it, and was just like, oh, wow.  He wanted Hellboy.  I got to take that.  I got to get that.  He buys his guns.  Sig's are great guns.  It's one of the video games he's playing.  I have done that, where I've played a video game, and one of the guns are really cool,  so I go to the gun store and buy a real one.  Do you have the Scarface grenade launcher one?  No, I have one that kind of looks like it. 
[03:56:00]  But grenade launchers are frowned upon by, you know.  The law enforcement.  Yeah, law enforcement.  I'm hunting with a grenade launcher.  Hey, why can't I hunt with a grenade launcher?  So what gun was this again?  It's a Sig 223.  Yeah, it looks a lot like that.  Yeah, that's the one.  It's got the same optic.  Yeah, that's the guy.  That's the right one.  It's taken into your house.  The Cali cartel?  Come out of here.  That is an attractive weapon.  I'll tell you that, my friend. 
[03:56:30]  Do you have, like, a desk and, like, a big leather chair with, like, your initials in  the back of it?  Yeah, AH.  Let me tell you.  I just had my desk delivered, and it matches the rest of the woodwork, and it's giant.  It's wood, and it's got leather on the top.  When do the two big ivory tusks?  Yes, I need ivory tusks.  And then I want, in bones, my initials above my head.  What are you going to do with this gun?  What am I going to do with that gun?  What are you going to do with this thing?  Take to the range and blast rounds off into targets that look like various things. 
[03:57:00]  Well, the range thing's going to get old and boring.  You know that.  Then what are you going to do with this?  You've got to go to the range.  What's the option?  He's going to hunt the ultimate prey.  The ultimate prey.  I am stocking up.  Yes, I am.  I am stockpiling because I do believe our Second Amendment rights are going to be infringed  upon further when the Democrats get into office.  And you will see gun laws, these stupid assault weapon bans, and things like this that are  semantics are going to be put in place.  There's going to be more limitations put on people's right to get pistols, and I will 
[03:57:30]  not stand for it.  Isn't it great how they're chopping down that tree?  Republicans do the left side.  The other guys do the right.  They just chop down.  Chop, chop, chop.  Republicans, we can listen to your phone calls.  Yeah.  Put microchips in your passport.  I don't care about that as much because I'm not saying anything on the phone.  Oh, God.  I'm not saying anything bad.  What am I saying on the phone?  Hi, Bob.  How are things going? 
[03:58:00]  And then I fall asleep.  The people that are tapping the phones are falling asleep on my agent calls.  You really fell for that, didn't you?  Dude, if you're not doing anything, what's the problem?  Okay.  What is the problem?  Dude, first of all, I could take a month's worth of your phone calls, and I could splice  it and edit it together however I want to, and you could never run for office unless  you said what I wanted you to say.  I don't think I could be running for office anyway based on my past on this show.  But if you ever...  He what?  In a what?  If you ever...  She was how old? 
[03:58:30]  He was how old?  Hot and candy, you have a zipper.  No, you know what it is?  They're literally doing stuff...  Smells like bubblegum and homework.  I don't know.  They're literally doing stuff when I was a kid when they used to talk how bad Russia was.  They can listen to your phone calls and all that, and literally 30 years later, now  they're doing it.  It's called the Patriot Act.  It's just being used to fight terrorism.  Oh, exactly.  Exactly.  That's exactly what it is.  It's to protect us.  Yes!  Yes!  It's protecting.  Absolutely! 
[03:59:00]  That's exactly what it is.  And then occasionally they use it for drug dealers.  Yeah.  I don't want it being used for drug dealers.  And then sometimes they use it for other crimes.  And occasionally they'll buy a new shiny black van and just people disappear.  That's like the next level of it.  I want everything.  Comers, scanners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just kept the keys.  They're talking too much on that radio show.  Oh, you're done.  You're done.  I am.  I'm finished.  Rothschild family's got a black van out front waiting for you.  We're going to just hear Bill go, hey, wait a minute! 
[03:59:30]  And it's like, where did Bill go?  If they haven't picked up Michael Moore yet, I got nothing to worry about.  They can't.  He's one of them.  He's being chased by a forklift.  He just ducks into a corner.  They're chasing him a harpoon somewhere.  Unfortunately, we got to get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Bill Burr, you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[04:00:00]  You're listening to the worst.  Worst.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's pretty stupid.  We, every once in a while, do the top country songs in America, but we're thinking of flipping  it today and doing the top rap song in America.  This song called Lollipop.  Have I heard this song?  Is that the top rap song?  It's pretty much right up there.  If not at the top of the charts.  Do you like this song?  I hate it. 
[04:00:30]  A million copies sold first week.  Of this song?  His album.  So that means a song.  It's because of that song.  Wow.  There are two separate worlds.  Oh, yeah.  Huge.  I have no idea.  And that's sold.  Lil Wayne sold a million copies of his album.  Yeah.  First week out.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Because Coldplay did 730,000 in their first week.  He, yeah.  And the song's called Lollipop. 
[04:01:00]  Yep.  Why don't you like it?  It's shitty.  It's just shitty?  It's just nothing.  Doesn't sound good?  It's just, you know, I don't know.  I don't, put it this way.  I feel old.  Like, I feel like, okay, back in the day, blah, blah, blah.  But he, I listen to the song and I go, this shit stinks.  But somebody's loving it because it sold a million copies.  So someone who loves it needs to, like, speak up because I don't get it.  It's awful, the music.  And everything is built to be able to be on a ringtone now because evidently ringtones 
[04:01:30]  are the huge thing going on.  So, I mean, I don't hate Lil Wayne for his, that's awful song.  I just, I just don't know who the people are who are fucking into this shit.  Like, I think it's awful.  Play, I mean, play the song.  I want to read the lyrics.  Uh, ow.  Uh-huh.  No homo.  Young mula baby.  No homo.  I say he's so sweet.  Make her want to lick the rapper.  So I let her lick the rapper. 
[04:02:00]  She, she lick me like a lollipop.  Yeah, she, she lick me like a lollipop.  Yeah.  She, she lick like a lollipop.  If you read the lyrics of Rappin' Delight like this, it sounds awful.  She lick me like a lollipop.  True.  Let me continue.  Shorty want a thug, bottles in the club.  Shorty want a, oh, shorty?  This is shorty with a W?  I don't fucking know.  Shorty.  Yo, shorty.  Shorty want a hump.  You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps.  Come on, yeah, okay. 
[04:02:30]  That's titties, I know that.  Lil mama had a swag like mine.  She even wear her hair down her back like mine.  I make her feel right when it's wrong like lying.  Man, she ain't never had a love like mine.  But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers.  That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words.  Told her to back it up like burp burp.  What does that mean?  Like burp burp.  Back it up like burp burp.  Yeah, but it's spelled burp burp. 
[04:03:00]  B-E-R-P.  Burp burp.  Maybe that, I think that means the truck is the truck.  Yeah, yeah.  I understand.  And I make that ass jump like jerk, jerk.  That's why.  And that's when she cores, ooh, okay, after you back it up, then stop.  Drop it, shorty.  Drop it like it's hot.  You should get into rap.  You think?  You're really conveying this song the way I'm sure it was meant to be.  Drop it like it's hot.  Do, do, do it, shorty.  Don't stop.  Shorty said the... 
[04:03:30]  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, well, I...  Is it an A?  Was it an A at the end?  There's an A at the end, but I don't know if I should even take the chance there.  You could do it.  I'm just reading lyrics here.  You're singing a song.  No, I don't know what.  Shorty said the...  Oh, look how scared you are.  I'm very scared.  Patrice, can you just say that word for me so I can...  No, you little bitch, say it.  Fuck you.  I'm not saying shit.  Just leave the lyrics in my car.  I'll read it later and...  Yeah.  I'll say the word... 
[04:04:00]  And beep your horn.  ...as many times as I do when I'm driving home.  Well, shorty said the, uh, you know, that, that word.  You know.  Seems like we hit a brick wall here with this whole bit.  I, uh...  Well, there you go.  Oh, and then it's...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's just loaded with it now.  I thought I could get away with it once, but then it's like again, again, again, again,  then again, and then again, and then a big again. 
[04:04:30]  What?  Two...  Ten syllables?  It's in this part of the song.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven times there, Patrice.  I'm not saying the N-word.  That's hack.  N-word.  You're the saint.  You don't say it.  Jerp, jerk.  Ooh, okay.  After I back it up, then I drop it like shorty, shorty.  Hold on.  All right.  Why don't we play this song?  Pitch two.  I want to hear how...  Let's try to relate to this song.  Shorty said...  All right.  And you and I...  I'm going to try to relate to it.  You and I, we're with our...  This will work.  We're with our bitches, and we're in a club. 
[04:05:00]  We're with a shorty.  We're with our shorties.  Yeah.  Shorties.  And we're in a club.  We're in a club.  This is a hit, by the way.  I'm drinking Patron.  I'm drinking Patron.  First of all, stop.  I'm at home.  Don't say Patron.  Don't say Patron like niggas drink Patron.  Say Patron.  Everybody drinks fucking...  Patron?  Patron.  Yeah, but I'm home drinking Patron.  All right.  Hennessy.  Yeah.  Hennessy, that's...  Yeah. 
[04:05:30]  All right.  I ate on the Hennessy.  All right.  We're drinking Hennessy.  So me and I...  We're at the club.  We're in the club with our shorties, and we're drinking some Hennessy.  Some Kvassier.  Yeah.  White people drink Kvassier, but go ahead and let you have Kvassier.  All right.  All right.  At the club.  Am I having some bub?  Get ready to burp burp.  I need some Cristal.  A little champagne.  Black people can drink champagne in general.  White people need an occasion.  Yeah.  I will say generally just chilling in a club drinking champagne is a black man's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like really...  Activity.  High class shit. 
[04:06:00]  White people need champagne.  They have to have toast.  They can't just say...  Yeah.  You got to toast and say happy whatever.  All right.  Here's Lil...  Unless the orange juice is in it.  Here's Lil Wayne and Lollipop.  Some shit is going down at the club.  At the club.  Uh-huh.  No, I'm not.  I say he's so sweet.  Come on, I lick the rap better.  So I let her lick the rap better.  Oh, with that effect. 
[04:06:30]  Is she sucking his dick is what I'm getting at?  Yeah, let's stop this rap.  Patrice, what do we know so far?  What we do know is that she is sucking his dick.  All righty.  At the club.  She's sucking his dick at the club.  At the club?  At the club.  He's a rapper.  Let me tell you.  How often does that happen at the club?  Regular square motherfuckers get their dick sucking at home.  If he's rapping about getting his...  He has to be better than the average motherfucker.  Average motherfucker get his dick sucking at his house. 
[04:07:00]  Uh-huh.  He has to upgrade it to club.  He's at the club.  And that's even upgraded from limousine.  You had to upgrade it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, yes, he is getting his dick sucked inside the club.  With a what?  With like a rapper?  Well, it's sexual in the window.  His dick is a lollipop.  He's sucking his lollipop.  Yeah, but what's up with the rapper part?  That means he's uncircumcised.  No, he pulls his...  No.  Where were we at?  He unwraps his dick out of his zipper.  So I let her lick the rapper. 
[04:07:30]  Not R-A-P-P-E-R.  There's no condom there.  It's W-R-A-P-P-E-R.  But it is word...  He's wordplay.  It's actually quite clever, evidently, because he lets me lick the rapper, but it's wordplay  where he's licking...  I'm the rapper.  Yeah, he's the rapper.  Rapper, rapper, and then she's sucking his dick.  Well, yeah, the first part, make her want to lick the rapper, that's the MC.  That's him.  That's the MC, yo.  Which is quite...  I have to say, which is quite clever.  I don't really want to analyze this and have any respect for this shitty song, but...  You don't like this at all. 
[04:08:00]  No, I don't either.  What is rapper with the W-R, then?  Maybe it's...  Maybe it's...  Make her want to lick the rapper, so I let her lick the rapper.  I'm thinking he has, like, an aardvark penis, and he's, you know, she's got to get past  that part.  Oh, wait, maybe...  Ah!  Okay, wait a second.  Stop the presses.  His dick is so long that it can wrap around something, like...  The rapper.  So they call it the rapper, because it can wrap around his leg, it can wrap around his... 
[04:08:30]  We'll never be black, Ant.  Damn.  I didn't even think of that one.  All right, let's go back to the song, Lil Wayne Lollipop.  He's so sweet, if I want to lick the rapper.  So I let her lick the rapper.  She lick me like a lollipop.  Yeah.  She lick me like a lollipop.  As a white boy, I understand this part, Patricia.  Yeah, this is easy.  Yeah.  This is where we need your help, this next one.  Yeah.  All right, I got it. 
[04:09:00]  I'm going to...  All right.  Shawty want a thug.  She wants a bad boy.  Bad boy?  In the white world, that's a bad boy.  Mm-hmm.  Thug at the club.  Bottles in the club, that's, you know...  She wants a little, like, fucking alcohol.  And Shawty want a hump right there in the club?  There you go.  Damn.  You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps.  Yeah, he's getting a little squeezy. 
[04:09:30]  Squeezy, squeezy.  He's biting off of fucking Fergie on that one, right?  Yeah, kid, right?  I don't know.  Fergie's got the lady lumps.  Is that what Fergie says?  Yes, Fergie's got...  You guys know Fergie's got the lady lumps, right?  Don't pay attention.  I don't know no fucking Fergie lyrics.  No?  The lovely lady lumps is from Fergie, right?  Yeah, that's that Fergie.  Oh, okay.  Bit off of...  A little biting off of, right?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  All right, let's go back to the Lil Wayne lollipop song.  Yeah. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What accent is that, by the way? 
[04:10:30]  Where you say hair like her.  Where does that come from?  Is that like fucking...  The Martian from Bugs Bunny.  I don't fucking know, man.  This ain't no niggas shit.  This is some...  This is...  This is pop shit.  A faction of something.  I don't know what this is.  I've heard that, though.  This is pop shit.  Her.  Over there. 
[04:11:00]  Over there.  That's...  Over her.  Rot her.  Rot her.  Rot her.  What is that accent?  That's...  Who made that popular is Nelly made that popular.  Yeah?  Nelly.  Where the fuck is Nelly from?  That's an accent.  St. Louis, Missouri.  St. Lou?  Is that fucking...  But that's not an accent.  It's a thing where black people try so hard to...  Like, we used to really invent shit better than white people.  Now we just do things to...  We try too hard. 
[04:11:30]  And we say things like scrimp.  Scrimp.  Scrimp.  Scrimp.  Just to be not white.  Right.  Scrimp.  Mm-hmm.  Here.  Her.  Rat there.  Her.  Her.  I don't know this shit.  This is not...  Other people.  This is just like country music to me.  I don't know this, man.  You know more about white people than you do black people.  Yeah.  You've studied white people.  I know about black people up until... 
[04:12:00]  There's a generational gap.  Oh, is that what the problem is?  Where I just...  This shit here, I don't get.  Like, if you ask me anything about rap from 84 to 92...  Yeah.  ...that I'll tell you everything and anything you need to know about rap.  You'll fucking tell me the shit out of Curtis Blow.  Every and anything.  But this shit here, I don't know what the fuck this is.  Motherfucking Fab Five Freddy, you could fucking...  All of that.  All of that.  What's the greatest rap song ever? 
[04:12:30]  Rock Box.  Hell yeah.  Rock Box by Run DMC is the greatest rap song ever.  Yeah.  And it bordering on greatest song ever.  Why?  Wow.  It just...  It doesn't border on the greatest song ever.  No, really?  What challenge is it?  Fucking what?  Fucking...  Rock Around the Clock?  Shut the fuck up.  I'm tired of you motherfuckers.  Stairway.  Stairway to heaven.  I've...  I...  You're saying Rock Box is the greatest...  Here's what...  Here's the difference between me.  I will go... 
[04:13:00]  And when I hear white people say, this thing is great, that thing, this is fantastic.  I will...  Like, I gotta go see this stupid Back to the Future and Raging Bull just because white  people are just special to you.  Stairway to heaven is supposed to be this song that moves white people.  It does nothing for me.  I don't like Stairway to heaven.  Nothing.  It's overplayed.  Riding.  Black Dog is a better song to me than that.  But as a black guy, it's like...  Some of the white guy songs I like will be almost like if a white person goes, oh, man, 
[04:13:30]  that song, getting jiggy with it with Will Smith?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a great rap song, right?  I'll go, shut the fuck up.  No, we're not that stupid.  So Eagles, like, Hotel California to a big-time, like, a legitimate white guy might be just  a cornball thing to say as a black guy, Eagle, you know, Hotel California.  Hotel California is pretty, like, fucking...  Pretty good, man.  That still holds up.  People still like it.  It's not hokey. 
[04:14:00]  People kind of like that song.  Let's listen to Rock Box.  Rock Box makes me emotional.  I want to hear some Rock Box.  This is genius for the time it came.  This is old school.  This is beautiful, man.  This is fucking beautiful where black people, this is some old rock bullshit, and they turn  it into, this is fucking genius, black, but it's, this is hardcore rock. 
[04:14:30]  Yeah, listen, it is.  And you can bob your head to this.  You can be cool with it.  This is beautiful, man.  You're the kind of guy that that girl ignored.  I drop a caddy, you fixin' a Ford.  This ain't...  It's...  I love these niggas, man.  Exactly.  It's just a...  It makes you emotional.  Why?  Play Jam Master Jay, Eric.  Jam Master Jay from the same album.  No, we're still listening to Rock Box. 
[04:15:00]  It just...  It's beautiful, man.  Why is it beautiful?  I don't know.  Why is Stairway to Heaven some shit that touches you?  Does he...  Does he talk to you personally?  It's...  It was innovative.  This shit was before its time.  This shit is alive still.  This fucking...  Look at you like a lollipop shit?  It's trying too hard.  This shit was like somebody came out from a hole in the ground that had been doing something 
[04:15:30]  that we never heard, and then when this came out, you was like, holy shit, what is this?  Just like NWA, straight out of Compton, you go, what the fuck?  Oh, yeah.  These niggas are from another planet.  That shit was some hardcore stuff.  And to this day, it's not even the hardcore-ness.  It's the...  It's the legitimate righteousness of it.  This song is righteous, man.  This is when rap was righteous.  This shit is not trying to make money.  This shit was...  This shit is genius. 
[04:16:00]  Listen to this fucking song.  You can't do nothing.  Oh.  Some MCs perpetrating a fraud.  Niggas like, what the fuck did he say?  Perpetrating a fraud.  You can do anything that you want to, but you can't leave until we're through.  You relax your body and your mind and listen to us sing this rhyme.  Hey, you might think that you have waited long enough till the rhyme was stated.  Lucky you.  Would be graded. 
[04:16:30]  Damn.  Not debated.  And not like this.  And all our rhymes make a lot of sense.  So shake your butt to the cut.  Like, this is awful, but it's beautiful.  Fucking Patrice is feeling this.  If I'm not for the rap like this now...  I think black people are from Mars.  Really?  I don't get it on any level.  I'm sorry.  Side to side.  Back and forth.  We're the two MCs.  And we're gonna go off.  Stand in place.  I'm feeling this.  Walk or run.  This could be the greatest song that ever was made. 
[04:17:00]  Keep singing, Patrice.  I like the riff.  Our DJs better than all these fans.  Cool.  I'm digging the fucking rock riff there.  It's a beautiful...  When I first heard this, I got emotional.  If I could have cried...  You don't know how to cry, though.  If I could have cried at a song, it would have been when I heard this.  That's how great this song is.  All right.  Because Calvin Klein, no friend of mine, don't want nobody's name on my behind. 
[04:17:30]  Well, that's a white thing.  Ah, yeah.  Sneakers on my feet, jay by my side.  Yeah.  But the Calvin Klein, that's a white thing.  That's white world stuff.  Not really, because Calvin Klein was big with black people back then.  Calvin's was huge.  With blacks?  Jordache, Calvin's, absolutely.  Okay.  Sergio Valente, I don't even remember those bands.  So what the fuck are they going to wear then if they don't have the Calvins?  Levi's, because you really can't...  There's no name on Levi's, even though it is a name.  It's Levi.  It's Levi, but Calvin Klein is like... 
[04:18:00]  You associate that with a dude.  And Levi was like a redneck.  Why would you wear his jeans?  Who the fuck knows?  I mean, you can make hypocrites out of anybody, but...  I know what they...  I get it.  I think Levi was way more racist than Calvin Klein.  I don't know.  You kidding me?  Calvin, I think Calvin Klein was a sissy, too.  I think we do a little Wikipedia on Levi jeans.  You're going to find some scary stuff in there. 
[04:18:30]  I think Levi is short for Levington.  All right, hold on.  We got Louis C...  The great Louis C.K.  Oh.  Oh, sorry.  I said the great Patrice O'Neill earlier.  You throw that name around?  I saw Louis' new hour at Caroline's over the weekend.  Fantastic job, Lou.  Oh, thanks, man.  Fantastic job.  Yeah, right on.  Thank you.  You like Lollipop by Lil Wayne?  I listen to it very loud on my speakers in my car all the time.  But you're white.  I know.  Well, so.  I love it. 
[04:19:00]  I just...  I guess it's a guilty pleasure or whatever, but I turn it up really loud.  It's the kind of song you need to listen to in a car where the mirrors are shaking,  like, vibrating from the music and everything.  Yeah.  I just really like it.  It's in the pop category.  I don't mind a good pop song every once in a while.  No, the last one I liked this way was Believe by Cher.  That's the last song that I liked.  Oh, jeez.  You heard it.  Do you, boy?  That's a little gay-ish. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, totally.  It's so Lil Wayne's song.  I mean, it's all gay.  Yeah, I don't think hardcore black guys are, like, you know, cranking up this lollipop  song, right?  Right, Patrice?  It's more like a girly song, I'm thinking.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But it's a pimp song.  It's that pimp.  It's that thing where black guys that are pimps, and they get furry, and they start getting  peacock-ish, and then they become women.  Yeah.  Well, I got something for you, Lil.  Yeah.  Do you believe in love? 
[04:20:00]  Yeah.  Awesome.  Lil Wayne said, aw.  He's going to cough.  He's whacking his bag right now.  Aw.  Aw.  You've got to listen to this when you're running.  You've got to go running with this on your iPod.  I believe.  It's very motivating.  Away from gay people?  What are you running from?  Well, the one, I mean, if Lil's going to admit, I'll admit, the one that gets me is a  Madonna song.  Which one?  Ray of Light.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:20:30]  I like that.  I like running.  All right.  Oh, Ray of Light.  Ray of Light makes you run a little faster, a little harder if you're working out.  Yeah.  Yes.  No, in little pink shorts, definitely.  Yeah.  You dick.  No, I'm saying it's awesome with the pink shorts.  I'm not making fun of you.  You like pink shorts?  Well, when I'm running to Madonna shorts.  Listen to this beat.  How could you not like this as far as pop songs go?  Not everything has to be a guitar riff.  No, it doesn't.  Okay. 
[04:21:00]  I mean, I don't search out Madonna songs, but if you're exposed to a song like this, you  know, I'm like, yeah, this is pretty cool.  Wait, she's singing now.  Well, let her start, let her get into it a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  You're just warming up on the treadmill right now.  Give Madonna a second.  Yeah, give her time, man.  She's, we're revving up, man.  We're going to a higher level here.  I don't think so.  Yes.  I think this is a girl's song.  Wait when she screams and I feel. 
[04:21:30]  You know what this looks like when she does it live?  Here it comes.  Fucking faggot.  Fucking faggot.  That's, I'm sorry, that's all I can fucking say.  What is this, inspirational, this horse shit?  Oh, yeah.  It's, if she's doing this live, you are just seeing gay men jumping around to this.  You know what?  Also, with magical blinking lights, with a lot of extra horse shit. 
[04:22:00]  Right.  That's what he's got, the backpacks on and stuff.  Yeah.  Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail, with his, can be enough for sale.  All right.  And that's all you got to do is see two niggas with Adidas.  And I still want to be Run DMC.  If I could be, I would.  This hat is a dedication to them, man.  It certainly is.  Like, isn't there motherfuckers you love like that?  You don't love this bitch?  No.  Hold on, here it comes again.  Come on, Lou! 
[04:22:30]  You did it, buddy!  Awesome.  Yeah, see?  I'm getting an awesome from Lou.  He knows.  He knows.  Now, the point to that music is it's all produced music.  And if you listen to those three songs, by the way, Lollipop, that one, and Believe,  they're probably the same producer.  Gay!  Totally gay!  Little Roger gay!  Yeah.  Lou, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Lou, now I'm not with you.  I could squeeze one of these songs on my iPod, not all three. 
[04:23:00]  I wish I knew how to quit you.  I might be able to squeeze this in between some cool, like, white boy rock music, but  not all three, man.  Oh, no.  But, I mean, they're all the same.  It's basically whatever, whoever that producer works for gets the hit.  Right, right.  Whoever gets, you know, it doesn't matter.  I mean, this is all shitty music, but it really makes my body feel good, because I think my  body's gay.  You really like Lollipop, Louie?  Lollipop?  I fucking crank it all the time.  All right, so that's fair, because I think I like some shitty songs, probably.  But Anthony's not innocent here. 
[04:23:30]  Come on, Ant.  What?  You listen to some weird stuff, too, man.  Weird?  Not fruity like that.  Like gunfire?  All right, give us one.  When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie.  I'm not really a Dean Martin fan.  Hold on.  Here we go again, Lou!  Yeah!  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Just get fucked in the ass as you...  This just brings white people back when they lived in outer space. 
[04:24:00]  I love Lou in the background.  Awesome!  Awesome.  I love Madonna.  Hey, Lou, listen, any group, what group do you love?  Like, you go, I love these motherfuckers as just, I love them.  Oh, I have old, like Led Zeppelin.  Like you love, no, number one you love.  I love Run DMC, and then there's some other ones I love, but if you go, you get a choice  to keep a music group alive. 
[04:24:30]  Number one for me is Zeppelin.  To keep Zeppelin...  Oh, my God, yeah.  Led Zeppelin is huge for me.  Number one.  The Beatles are huge for me.  Led Zeppelin's huge for me.  I love the Beatles myself, but number one, you go, this survives.  Zeppelin?  Timeless.  I had started, that's really...  Timeless.  It's just not that easy.  Zeppelin overplayed.  Not?  It's just not that easy.  No, the songs they play on the radio overplayed.  So overplayed, Zeppelin.  Someone has a whole catalog that could hit the radio airwaves tomorrow and do extremely 
[04:25:00]  well.  And also, it depends on, like, I just got this Marvin Gaye CD, and I can't stop listening  to that.  Which one?  What song, Lo?  What's Going On, the whole album.  It's one song fades into the next, and it's phenomenally good.  Are you a hippie?  It's better than anything right now.  Marvin Gaye would score.  You can't really argue that one, man.  Marvin Gaye was...  Competes with Led Zeppelin?  Probably so.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Anything, any best black artistic anything probably beats any artistic white anything. 
[04:25:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I'll tell you what...  That's a very bold statement.  That certainly is.  Hey, I want to thank Billy Boston.  Yes, I'll tell you a rap song that I couldn't get enough of.  99 Problems, but the bitch ain't won.  Of course, because it's just...  But that shit was...  What's wrong with that?  Nothing wrong with it.  What's wrong with me liking that song?  It's nothing wrong with you liking that song.  I'm not going to search out black songs in general, but if I'm exposed to a song like that,  that's what I like.  I'm into that song, but you're into it for just... 
[04:26:00]  Because white people are fascinated with pimping.  No, dude.  And fascinated with that shit.  It's the beat of this song.  I had a dryer sheet in my shirt.  And that bass line is amazing.  But Rockbox is...  What happened?  Rockbox.  I had a dryer sheet in my shirt.  Oh, you better...  You better...  Can I just say one thing about lollipop?  Yeah.  You guys were trying to figure out...  I mean, the wrapper thing is really simple.  It's just the letter lick the wrapper.  Like, if you've got a lollipop, it's got a wrapper on it.  Oh, right.  So, he's talking about a condom? 
[04:26:30]  No.  He's saying that...  He's saying...  In the double entendre...  The first entendre is the wrapper that you put on a lollipop.  Right.  She wants to lick the wrapper like...  It's like he's giving her scraps.  And then the other side of it is wrapper with an...  Starting with an R.  Yeah.  Because he is a wrapper who...  That makes sense.  She's, like, fooling around with the wrapper a little bit.  Could be the pants.  Could be the fly.  Like, the wrapper.  Or he's just a stupid black guy who's...  Making up stupid words. 
[04:27:00]  That's a very bold statement there, Bluey.  Yeah.  You could say that.  He's Mexican.  No, I've been saying it.  He's stupid.  And he happens to also be black.  I like that.  There's an apology coming.  Do you have black friends, Bluey?  I'm sorry I said that.  Yeah.  Hey, hello.  Did you hear the Shaq freestyle thing?  The what?  Shaq freestyling about Kobe?  What did Shaq say about Kobe?  Oh, shit. 
[04:27:30]  Oh, shit.  We got the uncensored version.  We got to play it.  It's quick.  So, stay on the line.  And we had a lot of fun with this this morning.  Figuring out Shaq came up with the best riff ever.  It's going to be all over the radio in the next couple of weeks.  Someone's going to do something with this.  Here it is.  It ain't about that.  It's about B-I-G, a.k.a. Big Shaq.  Now, that's the difference between first and last break.  Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes.  Okay.  Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes. 
[04:28:00]  Okay, everybody.  Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes.  Did they bleep nigga?  That's why I'm getting divorced.  That was enough.  He said Shaq gave a picture meal.  I don't do that.  Because my name should kill.  I love him.  I don't leave him.  I got a vasectomy.  Now, I can't breathe him.  Kobe, how my ass tastes.  Everybody.  Kobe, how my ass tastes.  Yeah.  Kobe, how my ass tastes. 
[04:28:30]  Kobe, you can't do it without me.  Kobe, you can't do it without me.  Everybody.  Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes.  Yeah, you can't do it without me.  Yeah, you can't do it without me.  Yeah, you can't do it without me.  Everybody.  Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes.  Yeah.  You got the crowd going.  What do you think, bro?  Kobe, how do my ass taste?  He's saying how's my ass taste?  Yeah.  And we were trying to figure out what that means. 
[04:29:00]  And I think we finally got it.  Well, he's saying, first he's saying, tell me how my ass tastes.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Which I think is, like to me, poetry is something that brings an image to your mind very vividly.  Yeah.  And so I immediately see giant Shaq with his shorts down to his ankles and Kobe just fucking  munching his asshole.  And then Shaq looking back and going, tell me, which is a really funny impulse while somebody's  eating your ass and looking back and going, tell me how my ass tastes. 
[04:29:30]  That really is like an inappropriate thing to say as that's going on.  Yeah.  Like looking back and going, hey, tell me how my ass tastes.  Like it's the ultimate narcissism that you want someone to eat your ass.  You know, I want to know how that tastes.  And Kobe then's got to like pull his head back and just go, oh, no, it's good.  It's good, Shaq.  You've got to look around the corner of his ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then get back to it.  I went with this.  You know, he's basically saying he's a better basketball player than Kobe. 
[04:30:00]  So Shaq is dunking the ball and Kobe's helpless.  And now his ass is at mouth level as Kobe watches the dunk go down.  I think that's probably what that means.  Yeah.  Ah, but Patrice came up with it.  It has something to do.  Well, it was the guy Malik.  He, he, he, he invaded, he investigated.  Malik from Asbury Park, right?  Helped us out.  He, what he, what he was saying, Louie, was he fucked Kobe's wife.  Uh-huh.  And when Kobe kisses his wife, he's saying he tastes Shaq's ass. 
[04:30:30]  Tell me how my ass tastes.  Because Kobe's wife ate Shaq's ass.  According to Malik from Asbury Park.  Like, that gives me another great, uh, visual, which is not the woman, like, I don't see Shaq laying on his stomach with the woman eating his asshole.  Yeah.  I see him just sitting on a woman's head, uh, with his naked.  And so you just see her from the neck down just coming out of his ass.  Until she's, until she's unconscious. 
[04:31:00]  Then Kobe comes, yeah, and he kisses her and he tastes his ass.  Yeah.  Well, we think that's going to be a huge hit.  They're going to take that Shaq riff and make something into it.  Make something out of it.  I want to know how his ass tastes.  Oh, now you got to wonder.  I bet it's not very tasty.  I don't think.  Well, I want to know how my ass tastes now.  Because that's the impulse there.  Like, you can't taste your own ass.  Like, I could actually find out what Shaq's ass tastes like.  Well, we do taste your people's ass because you keep shitting in the spinach and the tomatoes.  So, tell your people to stop shitting in our food so we won't know what you're at. 
[04:31:30]  Hey, tell me how my ass tastes.  Our shit doesn't taste like our ass.  Idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Tell me how my shit tastes.  I will when I get out the hospital for salmonella, you motherfuckers.  Oh, fuck, man.  Damn.  So.  Still better than you, you fucking slut.  Get a little too real now, man. 
[04:32:00]  Oh, it all just comes out, man.  That was like the untouchables.  Still better than you, you stuck Irish pig.  Just a lot of brown people fighting for the scraps.  That's all we are.  You know what made me laugh all day yesterday was our discussion on The Special Place.  How girls will say they're saving their ass for marriage. 
[04:32:30]  I heard that.  That's amazing.  It's like that.  The fucking special place.  But then when you really break it down, you're like, what the fuck is special about that?  That's what they should be giving up before marriage.  First thing should be that fucking stinky goddamn sewer.  Yeah, women should be giving up the stink hole.  Right.  No, the hole where miracles happen, where two cells divide and life begins.  Yeah.  That's, to her, that's like a fucking Taco Bell drive-thru.  Yeah, right.  Go ahead through there. 
[04:33:00]  But the place where shit and fucking diarrhea and fucking eight-day-old guys come that slithered back out.  That's fucking, she's saving that.  That's got a little blue ribbon on it.  That's the magic fucking prize.  Yeah, that's where, wrap it up.  Where the guys really want to be, right there.  Yeah, that's where she's got a little blue ribbon and a poem written in script, you know, by Khalil Gibran and all that shit.  Calligraphy.  I'm saving my shit hole for my husband. 
[04:33:30]  We finally broke it down yesterday.  We finally broke it down yesterday.  We're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  What are you saving that for?  What are you talking about this?  This stupid special place.  Ain't the prize.  There's nothing special about it.  This hole that has shot out like gobs of diarrhea after a bad meal.  I'm saving that for the man that I love, who I haven't yet met, who I'm going to love.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't get it.  Oh, my God.  That pristine place.  Fucking stupid cunt that woman was. 
[04:34:00]  I hated her.  I was driving around yelling at my fucking radio when she was on.  I hated her.  Which one?  The woman who you were talking to at that moment that called in the fucking drunk.  Oh, the drunk with the...  Yeah.  Oh, I hated her.  Fucking annoying.  It looked like she had a little coke habit.  I can't believe how patient you guys are with people like that.  I just wanted to fucking find her.  I want you to keep her on the phone so we can get a trace on her and I can go to her.  And beat her to death.  Yeah. 
[04:34:30]  We were trying to get into her head a little bit.  Like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Didn't pan out.  No.  That one didn't pan out.  You know.  That may be the one kind of person in the world where there would be no benefit finding  out what makes her tick.  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  You know.  Yeah.  You know, like, whatever.  Like, Hitler or the terrorists.  We really...  It'd be really good to know what those people are like so we can...  Well...  But she...  There's nothing to get.  We're learning about Hitler today.  We're finding out he had a sense of humor.  That he's a funny guy.  That Hitler was a funny guy. 
[04:35:00]  We got two big comedians.  One on the phone and one in studio.  What do you think about Hitler being a funny guy?  He used to make jokes about all of his subordinates.  Yeah.  He was like Bush.  Like, how he had nicknames for his people and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Hitler...  What I heard is that Hitler, when he saw Chaplin...  He loved Charlie Chaplin.  And when Charlie Chaplin made the Great Dictator, it broke Hitler's heart.  Like, it really hurt his feelings.  Aw.  Poor Hitler. 
[04:35:30]  I know.  It's like, you didn't have to...  Poor Hitler.  At first, he was like, look at this motherfucker with my mustache.  Yeah.  He's a tanky for that.  Wait, I think he's making fun of me, this motherfucker.  Poor Hitler.  Yeah.  Adolf Hitler took time out from running Nazi Germany to make jokes at the expense of his  henchmen, a new book claims.  His favorite victim was Luftwaffe, chief.  Luftwaffe.  I know.  The chief Heinrich Himmler.  Hermann. 
[04:36:00]  That was Hermann Göring.  Right.  Who was notoriously fond of awarding himself medals and decorations.  According to the book, by the last surviving member of his bunker, Hitler recounted how  Ms. Gang found her husband waving a baton over his underwear in the bedroom and asked  him what he was doing.  He replied, I'm promoting my underpants to overpants.  Hitler.  Oh, that Hitler.  Wow.  Hitler.  That Hitler was a boy.  Hitler then joked.  Hitler's hysterical.  Underpants.  He's promoting him to overpants. 
[04:36:30]  I sound like he wrote for Hogan's Hero.  Hogan!  Hitler said to be so proud of his joke that he made medals made from gold and silver paper  for getting to wear on his pajamas.  I wonder where the gold and silver came from.  How did a motherfucker that tried to kill an entire race have a sense of humor ever?  He's a funny guy.  Let's just listen to that joke.  What's not funny about killing all the Jews?  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Louis.  I mean, what's not funny about that? 
[04:37:00]  How the fuck do you do that?  On another occasion, he noticed his official photographer, Heinrich Hoffman, had drunk too  much and told him, don't stand too near the fire, Heinrich.  You might burst into flames.  Oh, my God.  Because he drank so much.  And you know that he got huge laughs for those jokes.  Oh, my God.  Who was not laughing at Hitler's shit?  Who heckles Hitler?  After the laugh died down, you know how everybody, ha-ha.  And he goes, okay, go put some more people in a gas chamber.  Oh, God. 
[04:37:30]  Like, you motherfucker.  Like, what's wrong with you?  It was a break in the action, a couple jokes.  All right, but now we got to get back to work.  Back to business.  The book is called The Last Witness.  It's going to be published in Britain later this year.  Oh, boy.  Who's not making jokes who everybody laughs at everything you say?  I mean, that's just too tempting to have an audience that.  Oh, yeah.  He makes a joke.  Nobody goes.  It's not that funny, buddy.  Yeah, no.  No one does.  No, there's two kinds of people that get laughs, whatever they say.  There's dictators and astronauts always get laughs. 
[04:38:00]  Yeah, true.  When you're in space and you make the slightest joke, like, you go, hey, I can see Yankee Stadium.  Somebody get me a hot dog.  And the whole controller just dies laughing.  Yeah, because they can die at any moment.  Yeah, try making that joke at the fucking water cooler.  Hey, somebody get me a hot dog.  Yeah, they'll punch you in the face.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Go fucking get a hot dog downstairs, you faggot.  And they throw him out the window. 
[04:38:30]  I know we're all over the place, but something else we were going to bring up here in New York.  Shea Stadium is closing down, so I guess, is it the last, what, Subway Series?  Yes, the last Subway Series.  Can we get that commercial still, you think?  They had dramatic music basically encouraging people to come out to Shea Stadium before they knocked that shithole down.  Like, there's something important there.  That's the CW11 that is running that promotion.  And I do believe I will be joining Jill at an event where we will be celebrating the final game. 
[04:39:00]  The closing of that shithole?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's called Shea Stadium?  Well, the last game of the Subway Series kind of thing.  Yeah.  It's the last Subway Series before the first one of next season at the different stadium.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  You see K setting us right.  It's like, yeah, I mean, there's hardcore Met fans that listen to us.  No one is sitting there crying because Shea Stadium is being torn down. 
[04:39:30]  Come and help us celebrate the last June 24th, 2008 ever.  No one would be accurate if they went on and said, look, you got your last chance to take a shit in the stands at Shea Stadium before they knock this shithole down.  The place stinks.  It always sucked.  Always sucked.  What's it going to be called now?  It's going to be called much better than Shea Stadium. 
[04:40:00]  Washington Mutual Bank of America.  Bank of some shit.  What is it?  They painted blue and orange like a city field.  It's going to be called, thank God we got rid of that shithole Shea Stadium stadium.  And I'm sure it's spelled C-I-T-I Field.  Yeah.  City Bank.  Yeah.  But they're dramatic.  Like, it's, you know, make sure you come out.  They had the dramatic, like someone had cancer music.  And Kenny, my favorite Kenny joke.  What?  I took my girlfriend to a French restaurant last night. 
[04:40:30]  Shea Stadium.  Oh, God.  Fucking Kenny.  He actually said that.  But he was proud, too.  Oh, he was.  He had a big smile.  Like, look at everyone laughing.  Just about everybody listening to us would say that as like, obviously, this is really hacky and awful.  Not Kenny.  He was so proud.  Hitler wouldn't have gotten a laugh with that one.  No.  Yeah.  There you go.  And, by the way, Shaq lost his deputy badge for doing that freestyle rap about Kobe. 
[04:41:00]  And I think the reason was because he used the N-word.  Yeah, the word.  Black guy using the N-word, and they're taking his badge away from him.  Look at this fucking asshole talking about Shaq.  Yeah.  Are we going to get the commercial before?  Fucking dumb dick.  All right.  Louie, hang on for a second, because you've got to hear how dramatic they're making this  last Subway series here in New York.  All right.  Where are you off to, by the way?  What's that?  You're in a car, right?  I'm in a car in upstate New York, yeah.  Oh.  Nice.  Very nice.  That's not nice.  Where are you playing? 
[04:41:30]  Nice.  No, I just dropped my kids off at their day summer camp.  Oh.  See, Louie is a good dad.  Day summer camp.  He's a very dedicated dad.  So you've got to drive upstate, or you live up there?  Well, it's so fucking complicated.  When I was married, I'm divorced, by the way.  When I was married, we bought a house upstate.  Small commercial, Louie.  And we bought a house upstate, and that's where, so my wife has that now, my ex-wife. 
[04:42:00]  And so I rent a house up here, so I can have the kids half the time up here in the summer.  Hey, I think you're announcing to our audience officially.  You've been kind of hinting at this whole separation-divorce thing.  Yeah, I don't know.  I still don't know how to tell the audience when I do shows.  I don't know how to tell them.  It's like harder than telling my children was.  It's a big part of his new hour, is talking about the separation and being a dad and stuff.  At Caroline's, I could tell you were a little awkward, because all of a sudden you're just like,  uh, I'm separated. 
[04:42:30]  You didn't know how to say it.  You just threw it out there, which I thought was kind of cool.  Start talking about your desire as a 54-year-old man to now get some new twat.  Oh, believe me, that was the first thing.  That was my first thing on my mind is, uh, I want many different vaginas to be enveloping my penis.  There you go, man.  Hey, was you getting a pussy in your prime that you were supposed to be getting, or is this going to be some new... 
[04:43:00]  Oh, no, this is...  I'm getting, right now, this is the best...  Is this pussy that's old to you?  Like, because I didn't get my pussy...  Old.  In my prime pussy years, I didn't get a lot of pussy, the pussy I was supposed to...  Like, from between high school and college.  No, that's exactly...  I didn't...  I never got a lot.  I mean, I got some really, really skanky road pussy when I was...  Because I started doing stand-up when I was 17.  Oh, lucky Louie, Jack.  Oh, you're going to get some...  Wait a minute, you're going to get some lucky Louie pussy?  Dude. 
[04:43:30]  Exactly.  I'm finally getting lucky Louie pussy.  You're going to get some lucky Louie pussy, nigga.  I'm getting lucky Louie pussy.  I'm getting lucky Louie canceled pussy.  Anthony and I...  Which is a little not as good as lucky Louie on the air pussy, but I didn't get that.  Oh, my God.  Lucky Louie.  Wait, you're getting lucky Louie?  I wish that show was still on pussy, which is fantastic.  Anthony and I have stories, man, Louie.  In our prime, when we were rocking the radio world, we were faithful dicks. 
[04:44:00]  Oh, what a dummy.  We had upper teenage snatch ready to go at all times.  I was married to some fucking just...  And we were the faithful dicks.  No, here's the weird thing.  We actually turned down going fucking skinny dipping with 20-year-olds.  With that, we're the Kahlua.  They were the Kahlua girls that would go around the bar with the Kahlua and wearing the like Kahlua fucking skirts and things. 
[04:44:30]  And they wanted to go out and, yeah, just go fucking get naked with us and shit.  And Anthony and I both went...  Gotta go home.  We had cartoon voices.  No, no, no, no.  I should have just called up the wife and said, look, I'm naked swimming with fucking Kahlua girls.  We should have taken Patrice's advice from yesterday.  What would you do?  If a really hot girl comes along, you would smother...  Not a really hot girl.  That particular bitch you showed, I would smother my girl with a pillow to fuck that bitch. 
[04:45:00]  That's what we should have told the girls at the time, Ant.  Would you fuck your dead girlfriend after you smother her and then go fuck the girl?  If that's what she wanted.  We would have told the skinny dipping broads, we'll be right back.  You gotta give us about 45 minutes.  And they would say why, and we would both say because we're going home to smother our girls so we could be with you.  Would y'all have done that?  Even if you were free to get that pussy, the thing I get from you guys is that you wouldn't have anyway. 
[04:45:30]  It's kind of like it's good you wasn't in a relationship because I don't see either one of you really fucking those bitches even if you had a chance.  We were faithful dicks.  Guys, imagine what a great news story that would have been.  Not a chance?  Both wives of shock jocks.  Well, I wasn't married.  Well, I don't want to make that point.  I wasn't married.  I hope he wasn't married.  But you was in one of those relationships though, right?  I guess.  I guess it's like...  I don't see it.  As the relationship got worse, I think of, you know... 
[04:46:00]  Louie, you're not doing Viagra, are you?  You still working?  I don't know.  I've got so much pent-up cum, I need no Viagra.  Have you done a threesome yet?  The first girl that I fucked since when we got divorced, I fucked her like six times one night.  It was crazy.  Oh my God.  How old was she, Louie?  Non-stop, 27.  So young but still like a woman.  Louie found like coke penis. 
[04:46:30]  But that's what it is, because he didn't get the pussy in his formative pussy years.  He was being faithful in half of those, and the other half he wasn't getting it.  Now, fucking...  He's getting...  That should still be on TV, pussy.  Yeah.  God damn.  I remember one night at the Virus Tour, I think it was the Philly show, one of the strippers  was really, really talking to me a lot.  And then she came into my dressing room with me.  She said, can I come with you to your dressing room? 
[04:47:00]  And I was like, okay.  And I was married, and my heart was...  Was you trembling?  He was trembling like, God, no, no, Jesus.  And I didn't know what I was like, I'm not going to cheat with this woman, but I do want  her to be in my dressing room.  She came to my dressing room, and we were both standing there, and I would feel really awkward.  I wasn't sure what was going to happen, and then some chaperone woman, some 50s, you  know, leathery-skinned woman, fucking threw the door open and just went to the girl, get  out, out.  Oh, really? 
[04:47:30]  There's some girl, some woman that travels with them that keeps them from fucking the  town.  Can I ask everybody a dude question?  There's a dude question?  What if...  Can you...  And I'm being real hypothetical.  Can you tell your wife or your ex-girlfriend, your ex-wife or your ex-girlfriend,  that I cheated on you when we were together?  What would be the fucking point of that?  What do you mean, can you tell her?  I'm saying, can you...  Is that...  I think...  Is that a bad thing to do?  Like, if you go, ah, yeah, I was cheating.  Depends on how the relationship went. 
[04:48:00]  If you want to rub it in her fucking face, if she's a bitch, then fuck yeah, you tell  her.  I'm with Louie.  What's the point?  You make shit up.  I'm just curious.  Just to rub it in?  Patrice, why would you say, tell that woman anything about anything?  Right.  There's nothing...  That means you care still.  Okay, let me change it there, because that was a goofy question.  Let me say, all right, listening to the story you just said, my mind was going there, so  I guess you made sense when you did that.  Now, let me try to fix it.  Yeah.  Say you fucked that stripper in the story. 
[04:48:30]  Yeah.  For the sake of telling that story and you fucked the stripper, are you allowed to say  it after you get divorced, that story?  Or do you keep that story, I didn't fuck that stripper, hypothetically?  Oh, you keep that story, I didn't fuck that stripper.  Until the lawyers do what they have to do.  That's a better way to put it, because I think the way y'all said it was right.  And by the way, we're still...  You don't want to set them on fire, man.  You don't want to get them going. 
[04:49:00]  By the way, we're still...  You were a saint when you were married.  Yeah.  We're still in the process of this divorce, so do me a favor, don't tell anybody that  I've been fucking women.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, no, of course not.  Don't worry.  Let's just put it this way.  Louis has so much cum flowing through his body at this point that the price of cum has dropped  for all of us.  Thank you, Louis.  Oh, no, the levy's broken.  Thank you.  I'm drinking your milkshake and cumming it into your mom's thing right now.  And what are you packing, Louis?  Well, I have a really nice dick.  I have a nice penis.  Look at him advertising for future... 
[04:49:30]  I have a really decent, excellent penis.  I've been told several times.  You shaving it?  No, I don't shave it.  And where could the ladies...  Shave some bushy red ball bush.  I gotta go, guys, because I gotta do some bullshit.  Kids.  They're Louis.  Kid stuff.  But I'll see you guys on Friday.  All right, good.  All right, thanks for having me on, guys.  Very good, sir.  See you.  Great set from Louis C.K.  Thanks, Louis.  Hey, this is Louis C.K.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:50:00]  And I don't know what else you're doing, but I hope you die soon.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm a little distracted.  We have a celebrity here.  I just want to get this out of the way, because I am a bit starstruck.  All right.  Pablo Picasso.  Linger a day.  My favorite song happens to be an old Oliver song.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And I understand that we have someone who actually can do it. 
[04:50:30]  Yes.  I have to hear.  Consider yourself live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a very famous song from Oliver.  From Oliver.  You might remember.  Actually, this is like probably the most popular song.  Yes.  From Oliver.  And a lot of times, this is, of course, Baby Girl, and you don't hear it in the organic  British accent, which I know that she does. 
[04:51:00]  No.  And I would love a live.  See, I can't do it on the spot, because I know I'm going to say it right.  Like, not wrong on purpose.  No.  I'm sure you won't.  Say it right.  That's fine.  Yeah, you've got to give it a shot.  You know, coincide yourself at home.  No.  No.  You've got to do it right.  Oh, my God.  Don't be shy.  Consider yourself at home.  Oh, my God.  She was actually in a play or something?  You were in a play? 
[04:51:30]  When I was little.  When you were little.  Who did you play?  Just an orphan.  Just one of the orphans?  And at one point, did you have to sing the big line?  Yeah.  No.  Well, that was more during practice, like when we were practicing it.  Yeah.  During the show, I think I did it right.  So, what did you do?  You stepped up.  And you went, and give it your all.  Give it your all.  Close your eyes.  I really can't.  Turn down the lights.  Maybe make her a little more comfortable.  Oh, you can absolutely, I'm sure.  Let's get her comfortable.  What was your dance move?  Did you have to do something like a step or whatever?  What did you do?  Or did your arm have to swing back and then forward and go, coin city yourself? 
[04:52:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  I really don't remember.  Go back in time.  But if you'd like me to do that, I'll do it for you.  I would love you to.  Yeah.  All right.  First, give it a good accent.  Make it loud.  Yeah.  I think you got it.  Danny, you should dim them down.  And then when she comes in, you should bring them up like a real play.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's true.  Yeah.  Wait.  Should she have a cordless mic so she has a little?  No.  I think I'm good.  Yeah.  Okay.  You want to spit the gum out too so you can get that queen really good.  Yeah.  Just spit it on the floor.  Come here. 
[04:52:30]  No.  It's all right.  It's like Dave will eat it later.  No.  She might be nervous on the air.  Chewing it helps keep you moist on the air.  Yeah.  Chewing it will fuck it up.  Let her spit it in your hand, Bobby.  I thought, dude, I better spit it in my mouth.  I know.  Well, I know.  Oh, you helped me out.  Yeah.  I was helping you out.  So what was the dance move you wanted me to do?  Well, it's like, it's just your fist has to go coin city.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know exactly what it is.  Look at that.  Of course you do.  It's natural.  And that's during the big long drawn act coin because that's English for consider yourself  as coin.  Wait.  No.  No.  Can you?  But I think part of it though should be that like while she's doing it, the leg has to 
[04:53:00]  come up a little bit.  Like coin city yourself.  Oh, yeah.  You kind of stomp a little.  Yeah.  Like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to be like the left arm back, like you're going dull.  Yeah.  Dull.  How would you describe that?  Kind of like a dull.  Yeah.  Like you're crossing your body with your arm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dull rats.  And the one leg should be lifted up.  It should be really a bubbling burst to consider yourself.  Yeah.  Perfect.  A little more pep.  Feel it. 
[04:53:30]  Go.  Yes.  Wait, wait, wait.  The lights are going to come up.  Nice and loud.  You have to project to the audience.  You have to project.  Yes.  Yes.  Nice and loud.  Should she face the audience?  And no talking.  You got to sing it.  Yeah.  Face the audience.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is for them.  Good?  Yes.  Perfect.  Coins.  Consider yourself at home.  Coins.  Coins.  She wants out of this studio so bad. 
[04:54:00]  Oh, I know.  So bad.  So uncomfortable.  If I knew this was going to happen, I definitely would have came in.  Where is that accent from?  Is that the British one?  Well, I think when I was little, well, I still now, I guess, I can't do accents or anything  talk.  Really?  I'm dumb.  Yeah.  No.  Coins.  City yourself.  It's supposed to be consider yourself.  Yeah.  But, like, my British accent would be like, would you like a cup of tea?  That was better.  That was all right.  It's better than Bob's.  Oh.  I don't know.  Not you, Bob. 
[04:54:30]  Not Bob.  No, no.  British Bob.  Of course.  British Bob.  That wasn't as bad.  See?  Yeah.  That was almost British.  Say crumpet in a British accent.  No, I can't.  Just try it.  I can't say it in English.  Just say it.  Just say it.  Oh, my God.  She's squirming.  She's nervous.  Why are you so nervous?  You've been on the air before.  I know, but I have to.  You're making fun of me.  You know everybody here.  You're amongst friends.  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  Hey, we got a little song for her. 
[04:55:00]  Oh.  Come, city yourself.  At home.  Wow, you're doing it good now.  Come, city yourself.  I want it to be family.  Let's have her sing along to us.  No, no, it's all right.  It's all right.  I ain't going to go to the bathroom.  I'm still singing a little later.  Danny, get her some headphones.  Do it in the studio.  Everyone else does it.  Could you hold your hand out and let me just see your hand.  Hold your hand straight out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  A little shaky.  The loons, Norman.  Wait, we got headphones so she can sing along to the song? 
[04:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, come on.  Sing along a little.  What's wrong with you?  Come on.  You'll love this.  We need a little cabaret here for Pete's sake.  You'll love this.  No, seriously?  Oh, she's freaking out.  No, Marissa, you can do it.  Yeah, you'll love this.  Coin, city yourself.  I know.  At home.  Yeah, just listen to it.  Just sing as much as you can, all right?  This really is an entertaining radio.  It is.  No, it really isn't.  Beyond comprehension.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Sing along to the song.  Here we go.  No, I'm not singing along.  Oh, sing along. 
[04:56:00]  Sing along.  Here we go.  At home.  At home.  You forgot to do this part.  That's all she...  I really don't know the words.  We'll print it off.  No, Danny.  Oh my God.  And Danny is uninvited to the barbecue.  He's printing it out.  He's printing out the words.  All right.  I'm not singing it.  Why wouldn't you sing it, though?  You did it, man.  How old were you when you did the play?  Eight, ten, I don't know. 
[04:56:30]  How old are you now?  Twenty-eight.  Yeah, so you did the play, and you weren't nervous then, right?  No.  Aw.  But I suck, and I know I suck now, so there's no...  I think you're great.  I think you're doing awesome.  Everyone wants to hear it.  You got a gift.  Why don't you share your gift?  You can't keep a gift bottled up like that.  It's really not a gift.  No, not really.  You already say the first part.  Just do the first part with the song, The Queen City Itself.  I love that she has no clue what to do with her hands right now. 
[04:57:00]  They're in her back pocket.  They're in the front pocket, on her hips, down, up.  I'm not doing it.  All right, we got the words.  I'm not doing this.  She's got the words.  All right, here it is.  Here we go.  Here you go.  Just focus.  This is easy.  The sooner you do it, you'll be off the hook.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just a little song.  And then we'll get into some cake farting.  Yeah, we all like singing.  Cake farting, live.  How about just the first line?  The first couple.  No, the first couple.  Just go as far as you can.  Just go.  Seriously, go.  Just go as far as you can.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[04:57:30]  Here it is.  Come on, sit at yourself.  At home.  Come on, sit at yourself.  One of the family.  Here you go.  Oh, wait.  She's falling apart.  What happened?  Hold on.  You're way behind.  What's up?  She's so uncomfortable.  I can't even handle it.  Unfortunately, we're going to have to start over because she fell way behind. 
[04:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were doing great, though.  By the way, Jimmy Norton invited you in here to sing this.  I love Coin City Yourself.  I think it's organic.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have said no either because it's a great song.  Yeah.  I can't do it.  I can't.  Coin City Yourself.  Yeah.  I don't do it right.  Coin City Yourself.  Let's try it one more time from the top.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the song.  One more time. 
[04:58:30]  Coin City Yourself.  I can't do it.  Wait a minute.  You're doing great.  Family.  We've taken to you.  So strong.  All right.  I'm done.  We're.  She's like Uncle Paul would love this kid.  Of course I do.  A part of the family.  Let's hear it for Baby Girl.  Yes.  Very good, Baby Girl.  At least we got a little bit there.  A little bit of Coin City Yourself.  Just mouth I hate you. 
[04:59:00]  This is Big A.  I'm sorry.  This is Big A.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Now stop staring at me.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  It's so good. 
[04:59:30]  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  You want to talk to John Popper?  You said Patrice.  Well, just look at John Popper over there.  He's John Popper.  And I can't take my arm over this guy because he looks like the dude that shot Eric Boghossian in Radiant.  Oh, you're dead, fucker.  Good show today.  Yeah, the guy that just looked back like I'm not talking to him.  Oh, shit.  Hey, can I get your audio?  Hey, dead, fucker. 
[05:00:00]  That was scary.  Holy shit.  Psychopaths.  Can we get that audio drop?  You're dead, fucker.  That is a creepy crap.  Yeah, he was great.  Otto's friends with that guy, of course.  Who?  Rockets Red Glare.  That's his name, right?  That's a stupid...  It's probably a stage name, though, I'm going to guess.  Perhaps.  So, who's the guy in the back?  When Opie said, does anybody have an interesting story, that little doll in the back raised his hands.  A little bespectacled, sweetie.  I did not have an interesting story, but I was just saying...  Tell us how you swallowed your harmonica. 
[05:00:30]  What did Anthony Anderson say?  Or what's that?  That was a good one.  He had no faith in it.  You should have fucking went for it like a soldier, buddy.  But here's the mistake.  Too many of these guys even know who the fuck Anthony Anderson is.  There's only one black guy that would laugh at that.  Yeah.  You ever, like, any girls you ever work and get raped in a movie trailer?  That's Anthony Anderson.  So, sir, what were you going to say?  Just tell the joke. 
[05:01:00]  Who cares?  I was just going to say, I'm from Chicago.  I flew in.  That was the joke?  And the plane's wings are killing it.  And my arms are tired.  That's a fat joke.  He's a big boy.  He's a big boy.  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  Sorry.  What do you do in Chicago?  I'm an animator.  Oh, yeah.  Coke Logic.  You are Coke Logic, aren't you?  Yes, he is.  You're Coke Logic?  I know.  Oh, my God.  I would have been Coke Logic. 
[05:01:30]  I would have been much nicer.  Hey, we're calling John Papa.  What the hell's wrong with us?  Thank you.  They're famous.  As soon as you said Coke Logic.  We're meeting someone famous today.  As soon as you said, we met in Coke Logic.  And as soon as you said Chicago, I'm like, eh, I didn't want to say Coke Logic and have  you go, no, I'm just another one.  Are you going to bring him on today on stage?  Hell, yeah.  I think we should introduce him on stage.  And Coke Logic, I got to tell you, I think yours is in the running.  I really do.  Fantastic.  Don't bias the judging.  No, not at all. 
[05:02:00]  No, let it bias.  But he animated a Ramone call, and how he did it is really, really funny.  The big reveal is very funny.  Yeah, we won't say what it is.  Yeah, I'll stop right there.  I'll give it away, and then it's, whatever.  What are you doing?  I think Coke Logic should come and sit at the table.  Oh.  Wow.  Coke Logic.  Wow, what an honor.  Oh, my God.  In a seat of honor.  Wow.  Here's Coke Logic.  That doesn't happen very often. 
[05:02:30]  No.  I'll be honest with you.  He's done so much good work for the radio program.  Coke Logic looks like a lesbian.  Holy shit.  Let me stop fucking with him, man.  This guy's genius, dude.  I'm sorry, Coke.  No problem, sir.  You said not to fuck with him after you just really just hammered him.  Yeah, I'm bad about him again, man.  His cartoons are genius.  They really are.  I love his style.  Tell me he doesn't look just like this version of Turnaround, Coke Logic. 
[05:03:00]  Humor us for a second.  Wow.  How close is that?  It looks like Papa, man.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  You got to get it up on the screen up there?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Give me a second.  I'll save this so I can zoom in on it.  All right, hold on.  We'll do a visual.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, stop picking on Coke Traveler.  Oh, Jesus.  We got the picture up there.  You guys saw the picture?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Dude, I mean, no offense.  You look just like Papa, man.  Let's be honest.  And you should run with it, dude.  Run with it.  Yeah, look. 
[05:03:30]  He took his glasses off so he looks even more like him.  Run with that shit, dude.  Yeah, exactly.  It would probably be a little bit better if I didn't get that every night at the bar.  I'd be like, three in the morning, be like, hey, Blues Traveler.  But do girls do it?  No.  Girls don't talk to me.  Girls don't talk to you?  Girls go Blues Traveler.  No.  Bye.  I don't like him either.  Good day.  We got to get Coke Logic as girl.  Yeah.  You know what I'm a girl called?  No girlfriend?  No girlfriend.  You're a fucking superstar on this program, dude. 
[05:04:00]  Superstar, artistic.  Yeah, you're right up there with Steven S. from Bayshore and...  You mean me and him get together?  Listen, maybe...  Hey, dude, he's super creative.  Maybe he can fucking run it.  He can take over with...  But you give him some advice.  Give it to Coke Logic.  Maybe he uses his...  Just drop off the Coke Logic.  How does he use his creativity and his smarts to get a woman?  To go somewhere where those girls are.  You have to be where they are.  No one gives a fuck in the street.  Hey, you know, I'm very creative.  Have you seen my cartoons? 
[05:04:30]  You creepy motherfuckers.  Has there ever been any girls who go, oh, my God, you're so talented?  Women are...  They're not like us.  Don't...  Never forget that, Coke.  They're not...  I know that if you was a woman, you would never fuck you.  And I say that for me either.  Like, if I was a girl, I would not...  If I was my woman, I wouldn't fuck me.  Because I'm me.  But she does.  Women are fucking like that.  So you'll find somebody...  As soon as the one girl goes, you're so talented.  That's what she's into.  You draw her face. 
[05:05:00]  Make a cartoon out of her and go, I hope you don't think...  Always go, hey, preface it.  I don't want you to think I'm creepy or anything.  Because she...  You know, I just thought...  She gets beheaded at the end of it.  You draw her face.  Then you draw your dick coming on her.  And then my ending.  Use what you got, big man.  That's your supreme talent, man.  Because guys all go over your shit.  So that means girls are definitely going to go, oh my God.  Because dudes go, dude, this fucking guy is amazing. 
[05:05:30]  Girls are going to do that.  So you have to find out what girls are doing.  Dude, how fucking great would that be?  If you met a girl, got close enough where you could make a cartoon of her.  Make her body look a little better than it really does.  And shit like that.  And then just make a real funny thing that she watched.  And just went, oh my God.  That is the sweetest, coolest thing.  And she'll be into you.  Trust me.  The girl, there's a...  You're nodding, though.  We're not going to pick on you.  Don't worry.  Jesus Christ, calm down. 
[05:06:00]  Holy shit.  It could work, right?  And never forget, as she's talking, right?  In some weird...  It's going to be a weird rejection.  Don't worry about it.  You establish yourself.  You know, her vagina is the only thing keeping her at the level of you mentally.  But you're better than she is.  Never forget it.  And she's kind of rejecting you.  And ask her what she does.  What's your talent?  I don't know. 
[05:06:30]  I don't know.  She has a vagina.  That's her thing.  That's the great equalizer.  Conquer that mentally, dude.  Conquer that.  And you'll understand that, dude.  I'm Coke Logic on the O&A show.  You understand what I'm saying?  That means something somewhere.  That's a good opening line.  Before she starts her spiel.  Because she's thinking about what I fuck him automatically.  That's what women do.  You understand what I'm saying?  So her rejection is...  Fucking Patrice, man.  You agree with some of that? 
[05:07:00]  Go ahead, ma'am.  What's your deal?  What's my deal?  Yes.  What do you do for a living?  I work for a toy company.  Of course.  That's the same thing the guy from Family Guy does.  Peter Griffin works for a fucking toy company.  What else, beautiful?  Do you have a man?  Yes, I do. 
[05:07:30]  Where is he at?  At work.  What does he do?  He works for a trucking company.  Just whatever, right?  Is he tremendously handsome?  Yeah, he's okay.  Whatever.  Let me ask you,  how was your date  when you went on it  with Billy Bob Thornton and Sling Blade?  Holy shit!  Oh, god damn!  Oh, fuck! 
[05:08:00]  Oh, poor man!  You gotta get ready to try!  Go ahead, look at it!  Look at it, Coke Logic!  Let the tears flow, baby!  It's all sickness coming up!  Oh, fucking A!  Oh, my god, man!  Shit!  Oh, was that wrong?  Oh, shit!  Woo!  That was not right.  This fucking guy's a goddamn crazy recluse.  For him to make all this shit, man,  he's getting it great.  Yeah, yeah, gotta be.  We gotta get you out the house, man,  before fucking Kevin Spacey kills you. 
[05:08:30]  Hey, Patrice.  Damien from Ohio writes,  oh, my god,  a self-help book from Patrice  would sell like crazy.  New title,  You're Better Than Her  by Patrice O'Neill.  You're Better Than Her.  That is a good title.  That's a principle, man.  You have to think that way,  and they have to think it, too.  Just use your talent,  because you gotta practice  to be able to play.  So your talent,  you have to keep doing it,  but get out the fucking house, dude.  Get out the fucking house, man. 
[05:09:00]  Get yourself a bitch.  Hey, that means he's not gonna do  the animation anymore.  Oh, we'll totally ruin it.  I don't want to fuck up your thing,  but I'm saying,  I know a lot of what he does  is just recluse.  He's gonna send in a fucking  three-second stick figure  fucking animation  as he's fucking everything that moves.  At least pump this fucker up now  to be cult logic.  At least get this motherfucker  some pussy.  At least.  He's gonna mail in a loose-leaf book  and go,  Yeah, where you flip the pages. 
[05:09:30]  There's your fucking animation.  I'm face deep in pussy.  I love it.  I love it.  We can take the stick figures  with a fast piano.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus, Patrice.  I'm sorry.  You know I'm looking to help  a motherfucker out, man.  We want to keep this guy  in his basement.  I wasn't even thinking about it.  He's right.  Look, you're insecure probably  about being a big dude,  but John Candy was a fucking big dude  and funny and respected.  You tell me women  they want to fuck him,  they want to fuck who you are.  That's where they're different than us. 
[05:10:00]  They'll fuck who you are  as opposed to what you look like.  That's the same thing  all of us deal with.  See, actually,  I think that's a little wrong.  I'm actually not so insecure.  It's just the...  roll the dice.  You know?  It's just...  Yeah.  Why are you rolling me?  That's not going to get you girls.  I got insecure listening to him  to say that. 
[05:10:30]  I start to feel like that  about myself.  Like, oh, Patrice.  No, you walk into a bar  and there's a handful of women.  They own it!  Sorry.  And for that night,  you have your options  and if they're not interested in you,  that's one night off, you know?  And just not very lucky.  So you think that's  a luck of the draw thing 
[05:11:00]  instead of a, you know,  play your hand kind of a thing?  Yeah, because I have no game.  Oh, see?  That's just that.  Yeah.  Give him a little something.  I don't have pickup lines.  I'm a keeper.  No, pickup lines suck.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  No, it's fucking attitude  with Patrice.  I've seen it.  It's fucking mystic.  You can't even...  That's right,  because on the sidewalk  after the show,  he does it every time.  He flirts with every girl  that goes by  and any of us  who use the same lines  will get smacked  in the fucking face, 
[05:11:30]  but they just go with it.  It's just belief  and I have to say  because my girl always listens.  I tell her this about me  and I have to flirt.  Because that's how I'm sexy.  I'm not sexy like her.  She's sexy like guys want to fuck her.  She just walks down the street.  She's sexy.  And I have to deal with that  a lot of times  because I've been with her so long  that I forget how sexy she is.  So I'll walk 20 paces behind  just to see guys want to fuck her  so I can go,  all right, let me...  I keep forgetting.  I forget.  I see this bitch nude  and walking around at her  not the sexiest thing, 
[05:12:00]  but dudes in the street  want to fall over.  So I tell her,  look, that's not me.  I got to talk to bitches every day  so you can feel  that there are some women  attracted to me.  That's the equivalent  of her looking hot  is you, you know,  playing your game.  It's me talking to a chick  in the street.  I have to  because then the energy  of women thinking  I'm attractive  has to,  she has to smell it on me.  You know what I'm saying?  So what you have to do  is be psychotically confident  but not arrogant.  You just have to be psychotic  like there's no fucking way  this guy thinks he can fuck me. 
[05:12:30]  You understand what I'm saying?  There's no way  and you go,  yes, there is.  You have to give that off  but I can't tell you  how to give it off  but how you feel  the most confident  is when you're doing,  like,  you see how you handed  Opie that thing  and said play it  and you just had confidence  that it was going to be good.  You have a pride,  an ethic in your shit.  You got to have the same  ethic in your confidence  somehow.  And use your cartoons,  motherfucker.  Tonight,  listen,  tonight,  you are Coke logic  when they see you.  Oh my God, 
[05:13:00]  that's Coke.  There's going to be  some bitch in there  that's like,  wow,  into you.  Stalker Patty will be there.  Shit.  You got to start somewhere.  He's such a nice person.  I'm serious, dude.  For real.  I like his personality.  I mean, I'm not talking  like you fucking pathetic.  I'm talking like,  you know,  you're a fucking  cartoon recluse,  motherfucker.  You know what I mean?  You feel me?  Get some cartoon pussy, man.  You're going to get  a hell of a reaction  tonight, my friend.  I say that you buy  yourself a sweatshirt  that says,  I'm Coke logic,  cunt. 
[05:13:30]  Stan Lee gets pussy.  You see that  fucking old weirdo?  Oh my God,  you created Spider-Man?  I want to suck your dick.  That's how girls are.  Serious.  All right.  All right.  Damn.  Y'all get Coke logic  some pussy tonight, please.  Look at Opie.  He didn't commit to that.  Anyway, I don't know.  I can't commit to that shit.  We'll work it as best we can.  We'll certainly work it.  I mean, you two got  gorgeous women, man.  Let's help the others out now. 
[05:14:00]  Let's fucking give back?  What is this?  Yes!  Is that a charity  fucking thing we're doing?  I went back to the community  to give some pussy back.  Me and Opie consider ourselves lucky.  We've sliced off some really attractive pussy.  Now it's time to give back.  Yeah, trickle down theory.  Oh, shit.  That's really funny.  This concludes the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Listen live from 6 a.m. to noon,  Monday through Friday,  with replays throughout the day.
