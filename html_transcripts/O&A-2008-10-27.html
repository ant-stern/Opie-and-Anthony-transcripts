<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous recounting of a party at FH Riley's restaurant attended by Opie, Anthony, and Eastside Dave from the Ron and Fez show.  Dave's extreme drunkenness was the highlight, with stories of him screaming obscenities, giving himself "wax shots,"  toasting naked, and improvising drunken songs.  Audio of his equally inebriated car ride was played. Rob Bartlett was also present, reacting with amusement to Dave's antics.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of an upcoming pole-dancing contest with a $1000 prize. Sports news followed, covering wins by the Phillies, Jets, Patriots, Cowboys, and Giants, juxtaposing the NHL's increasing family-friendliness with a video of a player smashing the glass.  The 2008 presidential election was next, featuring criticisms of Obama's "socialist" policies (using a 2001 interview excerpt), McCain's campaign, and Biden's personality (with a contentious interview clip).  Callers shared their experiences with the sleep medication Lunesta, detailing sleepwalking and sleep driving.  Finally, a story about dildos being thrown onto the ice at a Swedish hockey game was briefly mentioned.

The show continued with a segment focused on the 2008 presidential election, societal changes, and technical difficulties. Opie, Anthony, and guest Sam Roberts discussed the Obama and McCain campaigns, with a caller, James from Cleveland, challenging Anthony's views on wealth redistribution.  The hosts speculated on potential social unrest and societal breakdown, using video game analogies. Anthony described noticing changes in New York City, suggesting increased crime linked to economic hardship.  He also detailed his exploration of racist websites, describing their hateful content.  The broadcast was significantly hampered by technical issues with the phone lines, causing frustration and humorous commentary.  A "Jacktober" segment featuring audio clips from Boston's "Lander in the Morning" show, including a “bad candy” bit, was briefly played.  The technical problems were partially resolved through improvisation.  The segment concluded with further election discussion, technical complaints, and mention of a departing employee. A final caller described being surprised by Sam Roberts' hair growth.

The next segment began with the hosts discussing their experiences with various radio shows and promoting Otto and George's upcoming gigs.  They mocked television appearances and jokingly described Cleveland as a "zombie" city due to its homeless population.  A critique of a Boston radio station's contests, particularly its "phrase of the day" segment, followed, leading to a discussion of the frustrations of local radio.  Opie recounted being accused of racism and his subsequent argument with Earl from Ron and Fez.  A bad radio contest with an American Girl doll as the prize led to humorous name confusion.  A lengthy discussion about bumper stickers, including clips from a Boston radio segment, ensued,  moving from road rage to inappropriate sticker suggestions.  Maureen McCormick's book and drug use were also discussed.  The show's technical issues persisted, with phone lines largely down.  Humorous anecdotes about their mothers and Sal's technological ineptitude were shared, along with a story about Sal threatening Opie and Anthony.  Otto and George's shows were promoted again, alongside a bizarre $1000 pole-dancing contest.  The segment ended with discussions about the difficulties of out-of-town comics and a playful bank robbery reenactment with Big A using a banana. The stock market's downturn was mentioned at the close.

This segment started with Big A's recurring bit, initially a mock execution interruption, evolving into absurd improvisational scenarios involving Scudebakers and a sturgeon. Otto from Otto and George then promoted his show.  A discussion about a 13-year-old facing child pornography charges followed, with sexually explicit and crude commentary from the hosts and Otto.  The conversation shifted to websites with nude images of young women, with further sexually explicit remarks and jokes.  Rob Dukes from Exodus joined, promoting their album "Let There Be Blood," discussing musical influences, a past altercation with skinheads, the band's violent stage presence, and a graphic anecdote about a murdered and partially consumed black metal musician. Listener remixes of the show's theme song "Pendulum" were played.  The broadcast concluded with a tense argument between Opie, Anthony, and Earl about allegations of racism against Earl, involving discussions about Obama, wealth redistribution, and the American Dream.  Advertisements were interspersed throughout.

The final segment heavily criticized Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, with one host using strong, offensive language to describe his economic policies as socialist and unfairly redistributing wealth.  He contrasted his self-made success with what he viewed as Obama's reliance on handouts, proposing a satirical charity providing laser sights to gangs.  Art Garfunkel was a guest. Earl engaged in a heated debate with the host about Obama's candidacy and racism in America, focusing on whether Black voters supported Obama primarily due to his race or policies, and the role of racism in hindering Black success.  The segment ended with the usual banter, including jokes and offensive remarks, and mentions of upcoming comedy shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Jew.  877-212-ON-A.  Make sure you write that phone number down.  Jot it down.  Hi.  Good morning, Anthony.  Hi.  We've got to make believe we're wide awake and alert.  Yes, it helps the other people, you know, wake up, get their day started. 
[00:00:30]  I want to say hi to everybody that went to FH Riley's on, what night was that, Friday night?  I believe that was Friday night.  I'm still recuperating.  Yeah, that was, uh.  We had a little get-together.  A get-together.  A little get-together.  Dude, that was so funny.  Eastside Dave showed up from the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, which was amazing.  And, um.  Because he has no money.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  But from, from beginning to end, and from what I hear before he even got there, uh, he was smashed and just on.  He wouldn't, he wasn't quiet for a second.  No.  I'm not even, I mean, for a second he wasn't quiet.  And the stuff he was saying and doing was just, I, I, my stomach still hurts from laughing so hard at the things he was doing.  He has no, like, switch. 
[00:01:30]  No.  That tells him, eh, you know, maybe I should not do this or say this in a crowded restaurant.  Maybe I should chill out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Be cool, let people eat.  Yeah.  Without having to hear obscenity after obscenity.  I took a horrific picture of him.  It's up on onaradio.com.  Of his blue tint, uh, tinted, I should say.  Blue tinted skin.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've never seen someone so, so white that they're actually, like, slightly blue.  Almost blue. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, the blood underneath his skin.  Yeah.  Kind of shows through his transparent skin.  Just trying to push to the surface to get some oxygen.  And then the, uh, where do you start with him?  The wax?  Well, I asked him, uh, at one point if he wants to do, like, um, wax shots, I call them.  You know those, especially at FH Riley's, you got those nice candles?  Yeah.  This is a new trend I'm starting.  I started with Dave, but, uh.  I don't know if you're going to find anyone else to do it. 
[00:02:30]  I know, I thought it would be a good idea, because every table has those little, what  do they call, like, uh.  Voted candle.  Tea light.  Tea, yeah.  Yeah, voted candle.  Yeah, so, you know, they're burning for a few hours.  This is a nice shot.  Yeah.  Of hot wax.  So I go to Dave, I go, you want to do a, you know, a wax shot?  And he goes, what the hell is a wax shot?  I go, I just throw this on your body.  He goes, okay.  He was so hammered.  So it was really up to him what part of the body.  I mean, you can play this game along. 
[00:03:00]  At home, if you like.  Next time you're out with your, your, your buds.  So I go, wherever you want it, Dave.  So he pulls down his pants and decides he wants it in the ass crack.  So I take this candle that has about a shot to a shot and a half of hot wax and just throw  it on his butt crack.  Yeah.  And then he ran around to the restaurant just screaming.  Screaming at the top of his lungs while people are trying to enjoy their food.  It's this horrible scream that sounds like somebody burning to death. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And he just keeps screaming.  He's running around like a nut.  Yeah.  Uh, people are eating and he's, he's screaming with hot wax.  Yeah.  Just all over his, uh, his butt.  A lot of whoo's.  Yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh.  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  This is sort of, uh, Eastside Dave.  Ah!  Running around FH Riley.  It's better.  Ah!  After a wax shot to the butt crack. 
[00:04:00]  Ah!  Ah!  This is what he sounds like.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That really is what he sounds like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And people are eating.  It's, it's, it's, it's, and it isn't like he's away from the dining area.  He's in the middle of the people.  Yeah.  Like inches away from their table.  That's the beauty of, uh, our restaurant.  Ah!  We don't stop you.  You never know what's going to happen.  There's a little fine dining going on over here there. 
[00:04:30]  Sure.  There's a naked guy running around because he took a, a wax shot to the butt crack.  But you know what?  He wasn't just screaming because of the pain.  There was actually one point where he was just screaming in frustration.  Yeah.  Where he was trying to toast Opie.  Yeah, yeah.  He was so drunk.  He stood up on a chair, but, uh, the music was loud.  So he was trying to get them to turn the music down.  So every time he would start talking, they'd obviously put the music back up.  Yeah.  So this happened five or six times.  So he just got fed up and he gave up with himself and just started screaming.  Just the same scream while he's standing on a chair. 
[00:05:00]  Woo!  Woo!  He's yelling, shut the F up to the people because he's trying to toast.  Yeah.  As he's, as he's holding everything that makes him a man.  Yeah.  It's just out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's on the chair with his pants down to his knees.  He was, he was naked most of the night.  I think that guy just is out of control.  And then later on, he decided to do a wax shot where he just like pulled his pants forward  and just dropped it in. 
[00:05:30]  He just dumped hot wax down the front of his pants and underwear.  Yeah.  And he's screaming again.  Then he had to show everybody what it did.  I've never in my life seen anyone like him.  I think you want to like just burn the crabs alive.  Like encase them in wax.  You know, what is it?  What?  It was the Vikings or whatever where they would throw that hot crap over the.  Yeah.  Over the side of the castle wall.  Sure.  Hot oil.  Hot oil.  He doesn't care. 
[00:06:00]  Down the wall.  Onto the crabs.  And we were laughing so hard.  I was waiting for him to take a header off of the chair.  I thought for sure he was going to fall off the chair because he kept getting on and off  of it.  Yeah.  And he was so drunk.  He couldn't even stand up.  He's standing on this chair yelling F you to everybody at the bar because they're still  talking like people just talk.  They don't know who he is or who, you know, they just are there for drinks with their buds  and he's yelling, shut the F up.  I'm trying to toast Mr. Opie. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Oh, we could start with his car ride to FH Riley's.  What is this, Iraq?  Oh, no.  Well, I had to pick Dave up.  Yeah, I heard that was quite an adventure.  From the XM studio at six o'clock.  And his show ends at three o'clock.  So he had a lot of time to kill.  So I pick him up and he's already in the bag because he decided to almost polish off a  bottle of Jameson.  He loves his Jameson.  So I get him in the car.  We're now on the LIE and he realizes he has to go to the bathroom. 
[00:07:00]  So he's rolling down the window screaming and he's trying to open the door because I  won't pull over to let him go to the bathroom.  Hold on, I've got to answer someone's question.  Greg on Long Island, go ahead.  I still don't get this Eastside Dave guy.  I don't understand what you find so entertaining about it.  I can sum up his talent and his career in just like a second. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  You know, he screams, he curses and shoves things, you know, and that's it.  The thing is, let me tell you something, he doesn't need to do anything else because when  he doesn't have a line, he'll do these things.  If someone just does these things in a room, it's funny enough when they do it in a room  full of people that don't know why someone is doing this.  I can't laugh hard enough.  It's just amazing.  He doesn't have a filter, Greg.  That's why I think we like him.  And I got to stick up for Eastside Dave. 
[00:08:00]  He's one of Ron and Fez's guys.  And when he's not doing all this crazy stuff and just doing regular radio with Ronnie, he's  really good.  He's good.  He's very informed about sports.  He's very entertaining.  Yeah, he's good.  It doesn't translate very well on the radio when he does it on the radio.  All right, Greg.  I don't get it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I liked Dave.  I liked Dave.  Let's go back to your rock.  So you taped the ride to FH Riley's?  Yeah.  At one point, he was trying to get his mind off that he had to go to the bathroom. 
[00:08:30]  So he's talking about video games and his life.  And then all of a sudden becomes mesmerized by the music that's playing in the car, which  was the end of Joan Jett's I Love Rock and Roll, going into the talking heads.  And she was.  So he decided just to do a whole song about how he was going to FH Riley's and Opie's party.  And everybody on the show.  Yeah.  And this is before the party.  Yeah, this is before.  Only of the shenanigans we were just telling you about.  Hopefully, this is good quality.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go. 
[00:09:00]  And we were looking in FH Riley.  And we were looking in there, Opie.  And we were seeing FH Riley.  And we were talking about a battle party.  And we were talking about Opie.  Yeah.  Opie and his fiancée are getting married soon. 
[00:09:30]  And Andy will be there.  And little Jimmy.  Norton's got a comedy show.  Hey.  HBO says.  The little Jim Norton is the one.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Opie's special party at FH Riley's is the one.  And Andy's the one. 
[00:10:00]  This is before he really started drinking.  He just entered Nassau County.  Oh.  He is a complete ass.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he got there and was just toasting.  Well.  His toast was great.  Every time he would toast, he'd yell out, I want to toast everybody.  Yeah.  E-Rock takes it up the.  And then, you know. 
[00:10:30]  And it would be so loud.  And he would be very graphic as to where E-Rock takes it.  And toast to that.  Well, when he first got there, because I was on the phone with him.  I was going to meet him and Eric there.  And he was calling me, complaining that Eric didn't know how to get there.  And he was just driving around in circles.  And then he got there.  And he told E-Rock to drop him on the corner.  And then he decided he needed to tell E-Rock to stop the car.  Because he wanted to relieve himself.  Yeah.  I pulled off the LIE off to a side road so he could go. 
[00:11:00]  And he's screaming, you don't know where you're going.  I was like, I wasn't going to let you go on the highway.  So I found a dark place where there was woods that he stumbled into.  And then, you know.  The rest happened.  Yeah, then he did his thing.  And, of course, he sang about that, too.  Oh, really?  Do you have other tracks here?  Yeah, I have two more.  What's the second track?  It's just him.  It's still the same song.  He keeps going on and on about you.  The third one talks about how I wouldn't pull over.  He was so excited that he was invited to this little get-together we had this past weekend. 
[00:11:30]  He's like a little kid.  Oh, he certainly is.  A retarded little kid.  Most people would be like, yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, I'll be there.  I'm looking forward to it.  Whatever.  He just, the excitement of a kid going to an amusement park.  What is Opie and the F-H-Rally?  Hey, hey, hey, yeah!  Opie's going to the F-H-Rally.  He's able to be there. 
[00:12:00]  He's so hammered.  Opie's got it!  S-N-H!  Jimmy!  Everyone ends with Faye on this show!  Everyone ends with Faye!  Hey, hey, hey!  Oh, let's go, motherf***er!  You know where you are, Louis G.J.  You're in your baby! 
[00:12:30]  Look at this.  I got the visual in my head.  They're just bopping on the L-I-E.  Wow.  Heading toward F-H-Rally.  I'm keeping the phone next to him, and he doesn't even realize my arm's just, like, laying across his chest.  Nice.  And one more track.  What is this track of?  This is where he starts singing that I wouldn't let him go on the side of the highway.  Oh, okay.  He had a song for everything, huh?  Sure did.  All right.  And you were looking at Wolfram Ridley.  And he's the guy from Mobile.  Oh, whoa! 
[00:13:00]  He rock is driving us now.  He won't let me f***.  He won't let me f*** on a shoulder.  He's friend, I'll be arrested.  And that was it. 
[00:13:30]  The phone turned off.  Yeah, of course it did.  He couldn't take it.  Oh, my God.  And before the party itself started, we were at a place down the street with two other people in it.  And he started telling me how much of a homophobe E-Rock was.  Yeah.  And that E-Rock wouldn't let him smell or touch him.  Smell him?  Right.  And then he started going over to E-Rock and smelling his face and grabbing his crotch.  And for the people that don't know, he's married with a newborn. 
[00:14:00]  Yes.  He gets what, at this point, four or five months old?  Something like that?  Yeah.  Four months, maybe?  Unbelievable.  If you thought he was excited to be at FH Riley's, you didn't see him when Rob Bartlett walked in.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Rob Bartlett from Imus' show stopped by.  Bartlett came in, and he wouldn't stop.  He was doing all the impressions that Bartlett does on Imus' show.  And Bartlett's just looking at him like, what, stop doing that, you're retarded.  He kept asking if he was insane or retarded. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  He didn't know.  He was just...  He was just...  Oh, God, with his big red beard.  All happy.  Send that to Stunt Brain.  He was absolutely happy.  Yeah.  He was just screaming Dr. Phil impressions at him.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Things that Dr. Phil would never say.  And then I was talking to Bartlett about a gag he should have pulled, which I thought  he was going to do, which is he's standing up, and he goes, anybody want anything? 
[00:15:00]  What are you drinking?  What are you drinking?  So he takes everybody's drink order and walks away from the table, and I sincerely thought  he was just going to walk out the front door and leave, which would be a great gag  to get away from somebody or a table of people that are bugging you.  You just go, what are you having?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you leave.  Because how long before they start going, hmm, what happened to my beer?  That's what Channel 5 News, why do they constantly make me laugh?  I can't.  I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  I get distracted when there's people running around in gorilla suits.  Well, they were.  Make your own joke at home, people.  It's got to be very...  It's because it's Halloween coming up.  Yeah.  So they had like a race with everybody in gorilla suits.  Sure.  It's got to be hot.  Hey, before we take our first break, who wrote this copy?  It's awful.  The economy is in the dumper, and people are losing piles of money.  So we're thinking, what would our audience do for $1,000?  Oh.  And that's how we came up with ONA's Pole Dancing for the Stars competition. 
[00:16:00]  Hmm.  We want to call it something much better than that, but the lawyers got involved.  Register at www.ondaradio.com for a chance to come on our show and pole dance this Thursday.  Yes.  Where the winner receives the cash and our stripper pole.  We're saying goodbye to the stripper pole?  Yeah.  Why are we saying goodbye to that thing?  Well, we might be getting a new one.  What do you mean a new one?  Well, this one's not used, and it's, you know, sitting there in the corner just gathering dust and storing equipment.  And maybe it's time for a new one. 
[00:16:30]  This company is schizo.  When we came back to regular radio, they welcomed us with a brand new stripper pole here in the studio.  Yeah.  And they went, oh, yeah, but by the way, we really don't want you to do naked women in the studio anymore.  For all the girls that would be coming in.  Right.  Yeah, that we're not allowed to have in here.  So why would you buy the stripper pole, then?  Doesn't make sense.  All right, so Thursday, we're going to have some amateurs, hopefully.  I want amateur stripping.  That's what it's about.  And what can they strip down at?  Like their winter coats?  They get it down to swimwear.  Oh, wow.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Swimwear.  Swimwear.  Wow.  How exciting.  Yeah.  God.  Swimwear in the year 2008.  Wow.  Help us out.  Thank you.  It's all thanks to the new film, Zach and Miri Make a Porno.  Kevin Smith's hilarious new comedy about best friends who've fallen on hard times to get out of debt.  They do what most of us would do, make a porno.  Most of us would do that.  I guess so.  The copy says it.  All right.  It's got to be true.  In theaters everywhere this Friday.  It is a good movie.  So make sure you go to oandaradio.com to check out the details. 
[00:17:30]  And we're heading toward the first break.  So I want you to just stay right there.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Looking at the sports page and all the good guys won.  The good guys?  All the good guys won last night.  You got the Phillies beating those dumb Rays 10-2.  That thing is over.  Yeah.  That is over.  Yeah.  Phillies lead the series, excuse me, 3-1. 
[00:18:00]  And let's not forget, the Phillies only have one title in their 124-year history.  Yeah, it's pretty big for a Philly.  The year would be 1980.  That's right.  And then in the NFL, all the good guys won.  The Jets beat the Chiefs.  You got the Pats beating the Rams.  Effing Pats without Tom Brady hanging in there.  Yeah, yeah.  5-2.  Not as tragic as everybody thought it would be.  No.  Then you got Jimmy's Cowboys beating the Buccaneers. 
[00:18:30]  And, you know, Big Blue.  Big, Big Blue.  Big Blue beat the Steelers.  What are they, 6-1 or something?  Something.  I don't.  I don't.  I'm a Jets fan.  You got to give them a little credit, though.  I'm a Jets fan.  I'm a Bills fan.  And I'm a Pats fan.  And that is the God's honest truth.  Wow.  Can you tell where I did radio?  That's tragic.  I lived in Western New York off and on for eight years. 
[00:19:00]  So you got to follow the local, right?  Yeah.  Then we did the time in Boston.  The time.  Had a great time in Boston.  I know.  It sounds like every time we talk about that, it sounds like we were doing a stint upstate.  Well, as far as radio goes, doing radio in Buffalo was like being in prison.  Yeah, that was awful.  Yeah.  That was God awful.  Rochester was really cool.  Buffalo sucked.  Boston ruled.  I would move back there tomorrow under the right circumstances.  What if they changed every street and made it a grid?  Yeah, that would help.  I hate driving up there.  That would help. 
[00:19:30]  And then on Break.com, we got to give them a plug today.  I showed Anthony, too.  Anthony's not much of a hockey fan, right?  No.  Not really?  Nah.  The last time I really was into hockey was when the Islanders were doing their drive for five.  Oof.  I think they still are.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was quite a while ago.  But for the sports fans, especially the hockey fans, if you haven't seen this clip yet,  Break.com, right on the front page.  Maybe we can link it on our site. 
[00:20:00]  They got an amazing check-in to the boards where the glass just shatters.  Yeah, what happened?  I thought the glass wasn't supposed to do that.  Glass isn't supposed to shatter like that these days.  Usually, a nice hit into the boards, you'll see a pretty impressive crack.  Yeah.  But this thing shattered.  Came apart.  And they got it four to, they got it like five or six times, different angles.  Nice slow motion.  You see the crowd just being sprayed with glass.  It's a really, really good hit, man, if you're a hockey fan especially, okay? 
[00:20:30]  Hockey fans love it because they all just stood up and started cheering.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Hey, put his head through the glass.  Yay.  Of course.  The NHL is making some major mistakes.  Some huge mistakes.  People are ready to really get into hockey.  Yeah.  But what they're trying to do is make it family-friendly, right?  Well, that's what they do with everything.  E-Rock's a Devils fan, and they're doing all sorts of family-friendly things at the Devils games.  Yeah, there's always events for kids out on the ice. 
[00:21:00]  You know, it's not just the Zamboni ride anymore.  There's contests and stuff to do with your mom, and the kiss cam is back.  Oh, I hate that.  And they're trying to take the fights out of hockey.  And I've been taking my two nephews, especially, J.D. and Carson, to hockey games since they were, honestly, like two.  And every time there was a fight, these kids would jump on their chair and get into it.  They weren't hiding their faces and screaming for mommy or daddy.  They were into it at a really early age. 
[00:21:30]  You'd have to smack a kid if he did that.  Mommy!  Mommy!  Watch them fight.  Man up.  Now they're like 10 years old, but when they were two and three, they were into the fights.  Kids can handle a hockey fight.  No one really gets hurt from hockey fights because they're on skates.  You can't really get the, you can't get that, you've got to plant that foot to really.  It's the old, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  So when you thrust your fist forward, the energy is also going backwards, and you have no friction on your skates to hold you in place. 
[00:22:00]  The NHL, they're just.  A little science for you.  Making major mistakes.  Yeah.  They've got to make sure the fighting stays, yes?  On Saturday, for the Devils game, somebody threw a lit road flare out onto the ice.  Nice.  A lit road flare.  Bravo to that guy.  Wow.  That's.  That.  Yeah, the Flyers beat your stupid Devils. 
[00:22:30]  That's a problem.  And the Flyers aren't having a good year.  That is a problem, you think?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Well, we suggested marshmallows.  What else did we suggest the other day?  Bagels?  No, pretzels.  Pretzels.  Big pretzels.  And why should Detroit just have the octopus?  Everyone should just throw seafood out on us.  Yeah.  And they've got to make the rinks a little bigger.  Yeah.  And if the goalie comes out of the crease, you should be able to just take him out.  Old school.  Old school.  Hell yeah.  The second anyone gets near a goalie, it's like there's a problem. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Well, back when we were all growing up watching hockey, man, if the goalie was brave enough  to go behind the net to try to get the puck, oh, I don't know why they took that out of  the game.  And that would always cause a bench-clearing goalie.  You don't touch a goalie.  And you know, they should bring back the bench-clearing brawl, but it goes with your logic with politicians.  Yeah.  You can't be the commissioner that goes, oh, we got to bring back bench-clearing brawls. 
[00:23:30]  Bring back the thing that caused the bench-clearing brawls.  That's why when they take these little things away, they're never coming back.  Who is that?  Anthony taught me that.  The Islanders?  Oh, Billy Smith was an animal.  Yeah.  He was a big lug.  Billy Smith is an animal.  Yeah.  Still is.  Is he really?  Oh, he's just a mean son of a...  What does he do?  I don't know.  He's like just hiding in Canada somewhere.  Because I didn't want to say the same thing you said.  It's like, what is he doing still suiting up? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Like he's still playing or something.  Yeah.  But hold on.  Let's say hi to Bob in Connecticut.  Bob.  Oh.  Hey there, Bab.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie.  How are you?  Good, man.  Good morning, Anthony.  Hey, the glass is made to do that.  That way they're...  If it breaks, it doesn't break in big chunks and cut people up and, you know, stab them,  you know, like with big, you know, like a big piece of glass could stab somebody, you  know, in the head or something like that.  Oh, you're saying it's supposed to go into like little squares so it doesn't like one 
[00:24:30]  big pointy shard go flying through someone's head?  There you go.  That's what it is.  I haven't seen the board shatter like that in a really long time, though.  Usually they have to stop the action because it's, you know, they have to replace one  because it has a crack or something, but...  Yeah.  Go to break.com.  It's a great hit.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Ian in Canada.  Ian.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, that guy's right.  The glass isn't supposed to do that, but it's the weakest link.  I mean, it's the clubs individually that are marketing. 
[00:25:00]  You know, if you guys are going to a Devils game and they're doing that crap, then, you  know, that's their...  Just tell them.  Get on.  Just tell them that that's crap and you want to do fun stuff at the intermissions.  And as far as, you know, we don't really care if you guys don't get the game.  It's good that, you know, you guys are fans of the game.  That's great.  That's why I love you.  All right.  You're in the club.  I went to a Devils game and it was the closest to, like, the Mighty Ducks I've ever seen.  They're very, like, very just family-friendly. 
[00:25:30]  Everything is just very...  Yeah.  Yuck.  I guess they figure that's the best way to cash in.  Get the families going.  You need some grime with your hockey.  You need some just grime.  They got rid of so much old-school, just entertaining stuff.  Yeah.  In lieu of family-friendly, family-oriented shenanigans.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Like what?  You got an example of that?  Well, the hockey thing is obviously the example, but everything in sports, you know, they just... 
[00:26:00]  They want to take, oh, they want to take, like, the masculinity out of things.  Mm-hmm.  Even, you know, just, I guess, cleaning up New York a little bit.  It was kind of exciting walking around with a little sleaze.  Not the whole city, but there ought to still be a few streets that you could go down and...  When you go on the outskirts, you can still find a little bit.  A little bit of sleaze?  Yeah, Times Square, forget about it.  Unless you're a gang.  What was it? 
[00:26:30]  Saw 5 or what are they up to?  Saw 6?  Saw 5.  Saw 5 here in New York, that Times Square theater that we went to see Semipro in?  Yeah.  I think it's the same one or very close to that.  This is what I was told by some people in high places, that there's two theaters in Times Square, one for one particular gang.  I don't even want to mention the gangs.  Nope.  And the other one is for the other gangs, or the other gang.  Yeah.  They figured that out a while ago. 
[00:27:00]  So they're not the same theater?  If you're a part of this gang, you go here.  If you're a part of this gang, you go here.  Ooh.  Well, in one of those theaters, all hell broke loose.  It's because Saw 5 was playing, one show was leaving, one show was coming, it was too crowded, and then just fisticuffs.  Yeah.  Galore.  A little gang war.  Yeah.  Nice.  Let's see how to Ed in Long Island.  Ed.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Good morning.  Hey, if you want to lose two hours of your day today, you've got to go on YouTube and search 
[00:27:30]  Nystrom or Gillies.  All the other stuff is there.  It's terrible.  You know, Gillies is a regular at FH, Riley's.  Yes.  In the heart of Huntington Village.  Yes.  That's 400 New York Avenue.  If you want to buy him a drink at FH, look at his face.  He's got, I mean, he's still a good-looking guy, but he's got scars everywhere.  Yeah.  From all those fights he did back when the Islanders were winning it all.  He would goon it up pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Well, now this guy's saying there were great fights at the Devils game.  Bill, Jersey.  Hey, what's up, man?  At the game, they had Riley Cote was fighting, and then during that fight, two other guys  squared off.  Aaron Ashram, and I forget who the other guy was for the Devils, and they wound up getting  game misconducts, which means they can't come back into the game.  Yeah, Ashram used to be one of my boys.  He used to play for the Islanders, and he's an animal.  See, that keeps him from fighting.  Ashram rules.  Used to just be, what, a little penalty?  Yeah, like a little pit bull.  He's like the old Ty Domi. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  I told you about Ty Domi, you know, the whole Coliseum would boo Ty Domi when the Islanders  played the Maple Leafs, and I secretly rooted for the guy, because he's just an awful human  being.  He's just a ty noisist.  That's what you want.  He'd be on the ice just sizing up who he was going to fight next.  The guy was just an animal, and he was just a short guy with a temper.  Fantastic.  All right, we've got to move on.  The good old days, I guess.  You know, this was from last week.  We were so busy, speaking of the road flare that was thrown at the, it was the Devils 
[00:29:00]  game.  Yeah, I know the Islanders and Rangers are going at tonight.  Go Islanders.  Where was it?  Sweden, I think?  Yeah.  Yeah, they threw dildos on the ice.  Lots and lots of dildos.  Not just one.  It was a whole flock of them, I guess, what do they call them?  I have a feeling they might have been listening to our show, because last week, I was trying  to get some kind of organization together.  I wanted us to all pick one item, and I wanted to attack the ice with that one item, and then 
[00:29:30]  boom, this story hits a couple days later.  We had nothing to do with it.  I'm just saying, it's a coincidence.  That must have been a surprise to the players, yes.  You think they turned the dildos on, and they were just dancing around the ice as they're  trying to collect them?  Oh, I pictured floppy ones.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Not like the hard plastic vibrating ones.  That would be good, though.  And they're just kind of moving along the ice.  Yeah.  One goes in the net, the light comes on. 
[00:30:00]  This is sports-related, too.  Isaiah Thomas, it's a really strange story that happened, I think, Saturday night or Friday,  whatever, late Friday night.  You know, Isaiah Thomas, the great NBA player, then he messed up the Knicks for a few years.  Yeah.  He supposedly OD'd on sleeping pills, but then he's claiming that it was his daughter because  they had to get the, you know, 911.  Yeah.  All hell broke loose at his house up there in White Plains, and then he's trying to claim 
[00:30:30]  that it was his daughter that was having the problems, and then the police chief up there  was pissed.  He goes, we know the difference between, we know what a 47-year-old man looks like.  How did he think he would get away with saying that?  So now people are wondering, did he do it on purpose?  I guess he took 10 of those Lunestas.  I've never heard of Lunesta.  Yeah, it's one of those.  I've heard of Ambien.  It's like Ambien, I guess.  Is it better than Ambien?  I think Lunesta's the one with the butterfly that goes across the, you know, yourself. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, because that's how you sleep.  That's how you sleep.  Butterfly.  It may cause sleepwalking and amnesia.  Sleep driving.  Sleep driving.  They talk about, I love the side effects on some of those medications.  You're just horrified.  And Lunesta and Ambien, they tell you you may have episodes where you get up, you start  trucking around, you have amnesia when you wake up, you didn't know what you did.  That's sad.  That's all right, man.  There was a certain girl that I was seeing for a few months over the summer that would 
[00:31:30]  take maybe an Ambien and wake up and do some sleep cooking.  Yeah.  Did she know she was sleep cooking?  No.  Come on.  Dude, the fire alarm would go off at some point because once the teapot was melted onto  the stove.  Right.  And then another time, another frying pan was melted onto the stove.  What was she trying to make?  Other girls stew?  You know you started a pan. 
[00:32:00]  What's wrong with you?  There is something about fire.  Boy, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  What was she cooking up?  I don't know.  Something in a jeans and a shirt.  Recipe calls for 20.  Never mind.  I'm not even going to do it.  Yeah, a teaspoon of grandpa ashes and young girl panties and then add a pinch of birth  certificate. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, and it would be complete like amnesia.  Wow.  Weird, man.  That stuff.  That's scary.  That stuff f's you up, I gather.  Were you ever smoked out?  No, I wasn't.  I heard about it and then there were a couple times I was over there where she was sleep  cooking.  What do you mean over there?  Oh, she does it at her place.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought she was doing this at your place.  Oh, hell no.  No.  She would, I guess, fall down the stairs first. 
[00:33:00]  You know, it was one of those kind of situations.  It's downstairs.  Right.  But at her place, it was all one level.  So she could walk right into the kitchen and start cooking.  Yeah.  Just sleep cooking.  That's scary.  Cooking bacon or something.  I don't know.  You know, I have a nice grease fire going when you're.  I have this comedian friend of mine and.  And he sleeps in a sleeping bag.  Yeah.  You might want to try that.  Sleep in a sleeping bag.  He's off Broadway talking about that. 
[00:33:30]  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  He's always good for one or two.  What's up, Brooklyn Ace?  I'll tell you what.  I actually was on that ambient shit.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You're on the ambient, Brooklyn.  Let's try that again.  I tried that ambient and scared me.  All of those symptoms except sleep driving.  I would do stuff in the middle of the night, get told about it tomorrow morning, go, no,  I didn't. 
[00:34:00]  I'm scary.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  All right.  You know what we should do?  Those commercials for the drugs.  They're always great because they sound like they're the solution to your problem.  Yeah.  And then they get to the symptoms or, I mean, get to the side effects.  And the one after another, and it gets horrific.  And they try to make it sound like a small portion of the people that take this may experience.  And then just a laundry list of bleeding eyes, bleeding blank, bleeding this. 
[00:34:30]  This might drop down.  This might.  Yeah.  Now, bleeding into the brain has been known to happen to certain people taking this medication.  Yeah.  If you experience bleeding into your brain, call your doctor.  Can we get some of those commercials with the side effects?  Yeah.  That'll be a good one.  I want to hear some horrific ones.  Absolutely.  Some of these have been fatal.  Yeah.  What?  What else?  McCain volunteered Mitchie Carb B into her own face.  We said that.  We were way ahead of this one.  Ah, she did it, huh? 
[00:35:00]  Made up the whole story.  We were way ahead on that one.  That was too obvious.  What a dummy.  That was just too obvious.  Just hurts the cause, you dope.  McCain on Meet the Press yesterday saying he's guaranteeing a victory.  How is that?  Explain this one.  He is insisting that the polls are wrong, that people are saying they're going to vote for  Obama when they're actually not going to.  Yeah.  It's when you're in that voting booth and that curtain gets pulled and you're alone, a lot  of people, he's under the impression, a lot of people are going to go, what am I crazy? 
[00:35:30]  Of course I'm voting for McCain.  And then pull the handle for McCain and he says he's going to win that way.  But when you see Obama in front of 100,000 people at his last rally, it does get a little frightening  that he perhaps will be our next president, a socialist in the presidency.  It's just, it's beyond me.  I told Anthony, imagine Obama has everyone bamboozled and he wasn't really running for 
[00:36:00]  the presidency, but he, you know, has like a CD that's dropping.  My new CD is dropping.  I just wanted to really get some publicity for it.  I never wanted to run for president.  Right.  The name of the CD is I Want to Be President.  Oh, I didn't mean that literally.  It's the first track is called Time for Change.  Wow.  That's a great idea.  Yeah, we can only pray that that is what's going to happen.  Oh, dude, I so don't want him to be president. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, I so don't want it.  He is just proven he is a socialist, a complete, almost bordering on communist.  He's really bad.  He had a little clip from 2000.  What was it?  2001.  2001.  Yeah, we got that.  Oh, where he just goes off and why didn't they break this out sooner?  And who broke this out?  I'm sure someone found it.  I'm sure it's not Obama offering. 
[00:37:00]  Before we move on, there's side effects of Lunesta.  Can you get the full screen?  Lunesta.  No, go up there.  There you go.  Oh, that's right.  Okay, Lunesta, side effects.  You may have unpleasant taste, headache, drowsiness, infections such as urinary tract infection, dry mouth, dizziness, heartburn, pain, nausea or vomiting, accidental injury, diarrhea, decreased libido, breast enlargement in men, painful periods, chest pain. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Why would you take this?  Just for a good night's sleep.  I've got to sleep.  How do you sleep with all that happening?  Oh, great.  Suicidal thoughts, confusion.  This continues?  Anxiety, more outgoing or aggressive behavior than normal, strange behavior, depression, hallucinations.  Hallucinations.  Seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not really there.  Signs of an allergic reaction, including unexplained rash, itching hives, wheezing, or trouble breathing, or unexplained swelling. 
[00:38:00]  Why would you take this?  That sounds like, yeah, why?  You've got to go old school.  Just do a shot of something before you hit the sack.  If I had insomnia and took that, I'd be so worried that one of these things was going to happen, I'd be up all night.  I'd just be like, I can't go to sleep.  With huge bug eyes, just trying to keep your eyes open.  Oh, my God.  You don't want the side effects to hit you.  My foot swelled up, and I can't explain it. 
[00:38:30]  Unexplained swelling.  We're going to get to that Obama thing, probably after the break, because we need a little time to do it.  Yeah.  Obama talks about redistributing wealth in the 2001 radio interview.  Which is socialism.  Don in Kansas City, go ahead.  Yeah, just real quickly.  I was on Unesta, and I live right outside of Kansas City.  I sleep drove almost halfway across the state, just outside Columbia, Missouri.  It's just scary, scary stuff. 
[00:39:00]  I woke up pulled over by a state patrolman, and I had no idea where I was.  It was wild.  I had no idea waking up, and you're pulled over.  Damn.  That's a nice buzz.  Buzzing out.  Yeah.  That's a great buzz.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Hey, Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, I got two things for you.  First off, on this Lunestra, as a truck driver, technically, you should be taking that stuff,  but I have a hard time sleeping in the truck occasionally.  So one night while I was on the road, I took some. 
[00:39:30]  I got woke up the next day, 19 hours later, with the sound of my side windshield being broken  out by the cops.  Who thought I was dead?  I missed my check and call to my office.  They were going to just pull a body out of it.  They were sure they were pulling a body out of your cab?  Yeah.  That's what they thought.  And I'm like, huh, what, who, where?  I slept through it.  The other thing, talking about Obama real quick, at his rally in Denver, I had five  friends who tried to protest at the rally, and they were refused admission to the Obama 
[00:40:00]  rally because they had anti-Obama posters in their possession.  But yet, McCain doesn't stop that.  Talk about freedom of speech there, Democrats.  Way to go.  They're very well choreographed, those Obama rallies.  But they do come up with 100,000 people to show up.  But again, I seem to think a lot of those people are there to see him because he's Bono. 
[00:40:30]  If Bono showed up somewhere to talk, there'd be 100,000 people just going, hey, I want to  see Bono.  It doesn't mean I want him for president.  Hey, all my guns are hit once he gets into office.  I'm going into hiding.  All right, Stryker, thank you.  Eight days to go.  It's almost exhausting talking about the election.  Yeah.  It's been too long.  It's almost exhausting.  It's been too long.  They've been campaigning for two years.  If I hear John McCain say, my friends, one more time.  My friends.  I'm not your friend. 
[00:41:00]  He better be.  It's either him or Obama.  Obama's not my friend either.  No.  You're the guy in the White House to hopefully try to make it better for all of us.  Well, not for all of us.  I understand, but the my friends is just driving me nuts.  My friends.  Let me tell you, my friends.  Senator Obama wants to take your tax money.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  We get it.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We'll get into the Obama thing from 2001. 
[00:41:30]  Also, might as well look at that Biden interview.  What a nasty old.  Son of a bitch.  This guy is.  He really is just.  I never thought it would be worse than people said it was when they first nominated him for  his vice presidency.  He was people saying, wow, this guy's like nasty and he's not he's not a good speaker.  And it's that's exactly it.  He's a horrid old man.  He's just nasty. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Someone's writing.  I want to check that out on his feedback.  Something about how he doing a top 10 reasons why he won't vote for Obama.  Yeah.  Last night.  I am.  Was it good?  Yeah.  Could we maybe find that?  It's sense.  Well, if you know, I guess if you're a Republican.  Just to me.  Also, Jocktober.  Yeah.  We we focus on one of the fine, quote, radio shows in Boston. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  We're going to Boston today with Jocktober.  So stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Got to get right back into this.  Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Got a chance to win a thousand dollars.  We'll tell you in a little bit.  Eight days till the election.  We're talking about Obama.  Just a quick observation about Palin, by the way.  Yeah.  You know they're getting desperate because now she's campaigning with her hair completely 
[00:43:00]  down.  Trying to look a little higher.  By Friday, it's going to be cleavage galore.  Pulling out all the stops.  You watch the skirts here to get shorter.  Yeah, they're they're on their last legs.  The Republicans here.  Did you see her wedding ring?  No.  It cost thirty five dollars because now she's making a point.  Look, you know, yeah, everyone's talking about her wardrobe and how she spent, what, 
[00:43:30]  one hundred, one hundred fifty thousand, whatever it was expensive.  It was or somebody else did.  So at the last rally, she was wearing her own clothes.  She had her hair down.  She was getting close to showing some cleavage.  All right.  And she had like a engagement ring slash wedding ring, whatever.  And the diamond was a little speck or big.  I think she followed your advice and got her or her husband did and got the engagement ring  at Penn Station.  Penn Station jewelry store. 
[00:44:00]  I think this ring was worse than the one you got, you know, when you got yours.  Got the for the old the old ex-wife.  I understand people don't have money, but this thing was so tiny that you couldn't even tell  it was a diamond chip.  Check it out.  I'm sure it's in your paper today.  It's one of those things they're passing around today.  It's a pre-engagement ring.  It's one of those pre-engagement.  Someday.  All right.  Here we go.  Obama talks about redistributing wealth in a 2001 radio interview. 
[00:44:30]  This was what Ant was talking about just before the break.  Yeah.  We'll put the picture of the engagement slash wedding ring, whatever, on ondayradio.com.  All right.  So you want to just play the clip?  Yeah.  I want to hear this.  If you look at the victories and failures of the civil rights movement, I think where  it succeeded was to invest formal rights in previously dispossessed peoples so that  I would now have the right to vote. 
[00:45:00]  I would now be able to sit at a lunch counter and order.  And as long as I could pay for it, I'd be OK.  But the Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth and sort  of more basic issues of political and economic justice in the society.  Doesn't even sound like him, first of all.  So what is he saying that that should be looked into?  And is that what he finally ends up saying?  It goes further if there's more on there, because he does kind of say, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  And to that extent, as radical as I think people tried to characterize the Warren Court, it  wasn't that radical.  It didn't break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in  the Constitution, at least as it's been interpreted and Warren Court interpreted it in the same  way that generally the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties, says what the states  can't do to you, says what the federal government can't do to you. 
[00:46:00]  But it doesn't say what the federal government or the state government must do on your behalf.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That doesn't sound good.  Do on your behalf.  That's what we want.  The government just writing laws to do things for us.  How about I don't want them doing anything for me until, you know, I ask.  Just keep the roads nice.  Keep the roads smooth.  Fill the potholes.  I can't even do that.  Keep the bridges up.  I can't even do that.  I know.  I don't think I want the government helping me out in any way, shape, or form like that. 
[00:46:30]  Keep the Constitution the way it is.  Oh, God.  We're done.  That's kind of where we started.  That's the one thing we hope for.  Oh, are we so done.  Yeah, but gas is dropping.  All right.  Yeah, I noticed that.  That's pretty cool.  When I watch these gas prices and, you know, the price of a barrel go up and down like this, like it's a roller coaster, it's so obvious.  What a scam.  Yeah, what happened?  What a scam they got going on. 
[00:47:00]  Why is it now $65 a barrel?  It was just over $100.  Because we're broke.  What?  It was $147.  It was $147 in June, I believe.  So what happened between June and now?  And why can't it always be at this level?  It'd be great.  The usage crashed.  Yeah, a lot of people, because of the economy, they don't drive around that much.  They carpool.  There's less demand.  Yeah.  It's construction.  But I don't know.  That's why you got to just...  Cars on the road.  That's why when you see a car, you just got to buy it. 
[00:47:30]  I love the people, well, I can't afford the SUV anymore.  Then you get the small little freaking Honda or whatever, Toyota, the Prius or something.  And then gas gets very affordable, and you're sitting there going, why did I get rid of my cool car?  Yeah.  Why did I get rid of the gas guzzler?  Yeah, because now, yeah, gas is cheaper than it's been in quite a while.  But everything else is expensive, and the economy sucks.  Yeah.  And apparently it's all McCain's fault.  I don't know how Obama spins that one, but, you know, talking about the economy and saying it's McCain's fault. 
[00:48:00]  Because he's Bush's pal.  Is he?  And how does that...  What does that do?  But didn't McCain start saying that, started taking shots at Bush over the weekend?  Yeah.  Or on Friday?  And he's also been saying he voted against some of the tax cuts.  And he did.  Twice he voted against making the tax cuts permanent.  Yeah.  Well, let's get into Biden, because it's much more interesting than that old Obama interview.  Well, that Obama interview might not have been interesting, but it sure was telling. 
[00:48:30]  It's a little scary, right?  This guy.  Oh, socialist.  Socialist.  Socialist.  People say that's a code word, too, for black.  Yeah, I know.  I read that on Drudge.  That some guy was like, yeah, you know, whenever somebody calls him a socialist, that's just code word for black.  It's like, what?  People are insane.  Well, let's hear Biden, that cranky old bastard.  I love him.  What a, what a.  I love him, because he's just a loose cannon.  He is. 
[00:49:00]  I look at this stuff just differently.  I just, I just feel like he's going to just completely lose it.  He's just a crotchety, ugh, unhappy man.  He's an unhappy man.  Yeah.  And, you know, when you're doing an interview, you're going to be asked questions, and I  guess, you know, you answer the questions, but this guy's just like, he's so pompous  and full of himself and just obnoxious.  He's one of those guys, you know, when you were growing up and maybe you played wiffle  ball or like Nerf football or regular football, some kind of sport, and the ball went into 
[00:49:30]  the neighbor's fence.  Oh, yeah.  And Biden's out there raking leaves.  God damn it.  He's that guy.  I've had it.  The one you were scared of.  The neighbor you were scared of.  Yeah.  Even though you knew him ever since you were like a little nothing, and he's still just  an ass, ass blank your entire life.  You were kind of friends with his kids, but they were all like scared of their dad.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't do anything bad because they know he just beat him senseless. 
[00:50:00]  He was a hitter.  I bet he's a hitting dad.  Well, I mean, he's the right age to be a hitting dad.  Yeah.  Hitting dad.  Knock it off.  I'll give you something to cry about.  Whack.  Backhand across the face.  Gotta hit your kids, people.  Yeah.  They're getting out of control.  Here's, yeah, this is the Biden interview.  Basically asking Biden if Obama's Marxist.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Marxist.  He's just an ass.  You may recognize this famous quote, from each according to his abilities, to each according  to his needs.  That's from Karl Marx.  How is Senator Obama not being a Marxist if he intends to spread the wealth around?  Are you joking?  Is this a joke?  No.  Or is that a real question?  That's a question.  He is not spreading the wealth around.  He's talking about giving the middle class an opportunity to get back the tax breaks they 
[00:51:00]  used to have.  We think middle class taxpayers should get a tax break.  That's what we think.  It's a ridiculous comparison, with all due respect.  He handled himself.  You know, if she was pretty brave, because it was a satellite interview, she wouldn't  be asking that question if he was in studio.  He'd slug her.  Oh, yeah, he would.  Is that all that's on there?  No, we got more.  She really went after him.  Well, that middle class means lower class, by the way, and redistribution of wealth. 
[00:51:30]  That's exactly what he just talked about.  Oh, giving them tax cuts.  Oh, really?  Where does the money come from?  Tax increases for other people that have more.  Oh, OK.  Isn't that redistribution of wealth?  Whether you do it by knocking on someone's door and saying, could I have 50 bucks to give  to this guy over here?  Or you do it through something called taxes?  It's the same thing.  You're taking from these people and giving it to other people.  It's redistribution of wealth. 
[00:52:00]  Stop it.  Well, we're heading that way.  Maybe what he should do, if you're going to take some of your hard-earned money and take  care of the people that are less fortunate than you, the government should force you to  give it to 50 people.  So at least we could go, all right, if you're going to make me do this, let me pick the people.  I'll pick the people.  I'll pick the people.  Yeah.  And then you got everyone kind of campaigning for your money.  That would be kind of cool.  They won't be dipping into the... 
[00:52:30]  That would be great.  How cool would that...  That's the way to do this, Obama.  They wouldn't be dipping into the money because then they tax the hell out of you.  And some of it goes to these people for this redistribution.  But then there's all these other things included that they're using it for that you don't know  about.  How about...  At least you know the 50 people that I gave the money to, they're getting the money and  they're using it.  And how about we choose...  And the other thing, you know, these people you choose, they got to be like making less  than whatever, 100,000, whatever the cutoff would be.  I don't know.  How cool would that be? 
[00:53:00]  And they got to campaign for your dollars.  Well, see, because I don't mind helping others out.  I just mind that it's strangers.  Yeah.  I help out a lot of people around me.  I don't want people telling me I have to help people out.  But that's not...  But if you have to, wouldn't it be better if you get to choose the people?  Yeah.  Sounds logical.  That's pretty much what I do anyway.  Right.  You know?  That's what people don't understand.  When you do make money, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with it.  I remember Bob telling us that back.  Yeah.  Back when we started making real money in this business. 
[00:53:30]  With great power comes great responsibility.  I laugh down like, yeah, whatever.  But man, you know, he tells the truth.  We pay our share, trust me.  And we're not talking about the tax part.  There's always people that are around you that need help.  And in some cases, you don't feel like you have a choice.  You do it.  And out there, don't feel like you're immune to being taxed to death because you're in the middle class.  Middle class is getting taxed, too.  He's talking about the lower class. 
[00:54:00]  He's talking about people that are below the poverty level, people that need to be brought up, as he says, and helped up.  That isn't the middle class.  He's not looking at the middle class like that.  He looks at the middle class as the wealthy.  He looks at the lower class as the middle class.  That's what he's calling it so he gets the middle class's vote.  He's already got the lower class vote.  I don't want to redistribute my wealth.  No one was redistributing their wealth when I was working my ass off and making crap for 90% of my life. 
[00:54:30]  You know, why the hell all of a sudden now?  It's this redistribution thing.  Go screw yourself, you socialist bastard.  I don't want to hear it.  But you live in a very safe area and a safe house.  Like, I'm starting to walk around New York City.  Yeah.  And the economy's turning.  Ah, stop bringing those.  And you can do this in your city.  Yeah.  You kind of see the zombies coming out. 
[00:55:00]  You see the look in their eye like they're starting to size you up.  They're not ready.  They're not ready to attack.  Not ready to attack yet.  But, man, am I nailing this?  No, you got it.  Thank you.  You walk around New York City.  I'm not saying that people are getting mugged left and right or anything like that.  Not yet.  But all of a sudden you see a little more homeless.  Yeah.  A little more people walking around that look a little disheveled.  They have the look in their eye just a little bit.  The eyes are changing a little bit.  In broad daylight.  In broad daylight.  That's the scary part. 
[00:55:30]  Not even like I Am Legend where it's only at night.  No, it's just the beginning of this.  You can tell.  Because when the economy, you know, craps the bed, oh boy, you notice it in the big cities.  Because the people that would be working at the fast food restaurants and the subways and the just name all those other joints, those people are now mugging you.  That's how it works.  They're out of work, so they're mugging you.  That's how it works.  The same person that's behind the fast food counter being very nice to you and getting your order right, that same person, not all of them, will be mugging us fine folks. 
[00:56:00]  That's right.  And as I walk around New York, I see it in their eyes.  It's slowly changing.  Just a little bit.  It's like any video game like The Sims or SimCity.  I've said it before.  When you cut back, things start falling apart.  Yeah.  And when that happens, you get these people that start committing crimes.  You cut down.  You ever play one of those games?  Like I played Tropico. 
[00:56:30]  I used to love that game.  Yeah.  You're like on this.  It's almost like a Cuban type island.  Yeah.  And you're the head muckety muck.  And you get your police force out there to cut down on crime.  And if you're using too much of your budget, you start cutting back on things because you're going broke.  You notice a lot more crime.  Mm-hmm.  And a lot of your people are unhappy and want to revolt.  Yeah.  But that game's fake because in America, we never revolt.  No.  It's only in the other countries.  Things...  I wonder how bad it would have to get in this country for us to actually organize a revolt. 
[00:57:00]  A revolt.  Like they do in these third world nations.  Yeah.  Well, we'll see.  Yeah.  Oh, tired of Anthony and his politics.  All right.  We only got eight days to go.  Only eight days left.  Okay.  Liberal-ass James from Cleveland.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Don't you realize that Reagan with that trickle-down economics right there was a redistributing the wealth?  Hey, when she puts four taxes on a barrel of oil before it leaves Alaska and takes that surplus from those taxes and gives it to the people of Alaska right there, 
[00:57:30]  that's a socialized policy right there.  Dude.  Plus, the bailout was nothing but a social policy right there saying we're going to socialize the losses, but we're going to capitalize the gains.  Yeah.  Comment.  Yeah, comment, Ant.  Yeah, comment.  As far as taxes go, no more was coming out of my pocket. 
[00:58:00]  I pay a lot of taxes.  All of these things you just talked about did not raise my taxes.  Obama wants to raise my taxes and give it to other people who are less fortunate.  That, my friend, is socialism.  Reagan's trickle-down economics was giving tax cuts to big businesses and companies that employ people, and it would trickle down.  Yeah.  It would trickle down to the employee.  And it didn't work.  And that was a socialist policy right there. 
[00:58:30]  How is that a socialist policy?  Because they're saying, he's saying, we're going to give you money or you can give it back to the other people.  And that's a socialist policy right there.  And it didn't work.  Dude, through their working and through paying them for working at these companies that got tax breaks.  That isn't a socialist policy.  That's capitalism, you dummy.  And those companies did nothing but hoard the money, and then he picked up and moved out of state. 
[00:59:00]  Hey, whatever they did, right, wrong, or indifferent, the whole gist of it wasn't socialism.  It's capitalism.  Then what about Paylan?  And that's your girl.  She's trying to get into the office, just like Obama.  I don't think you know.  Not just like Obama.  Don't run her as president.  You're nuts.  She's a vice presidential candidate.  Obama is the presidential candidate.  There's a big difference there.  And you said it many a times.  That fool, McCain, looks like he's about to fall over at any moment in time. 
[00:59:30]  And you don't mean to tell me that the first black president doesn't have a chance,  that perhaps something might befall him.  There's a lot of risk there, too, my friend.  Trust me.  Listen, I'm a black truck driver.  No crap.  I can tell you a black the second you called.  I get the same stuff, and I get the same looks from some people.  I understand that there's people out there that do want to take them out.  And there's people out there that do want to take McCain out, too.  Just vote for your homeboy. 
[01:00:00]  Just vote for your homie, dude.  Just like 98% of black people are doing.  Just vote for him because he's black.  A lot of whitey voting.  Anthony, Anthony, you know something?  What's going to happen?  Right there, I'm not voting for him because he's black.  All right.  I actually like McCain.  98% of black people enjoy his politics.  I actually like McCain up until he pulled that Palin chick up out of Alaska,  and she opened up her little mouth.  And she was just dumb as a box of rocks.  That was my problem with McCain. 
[01:00:30]  I'll agree with that.  Because I actually like the gun policy that you bring up,  and that's one thing I absolutely hate with Obama.  I'm actually staming with you with that.  Oh, okay, good.  Now we're friends.  I don't like the gun policy.  This guy almost wants to vote McCain.  Almost.  Thanks, James.  We've got to move on.  Hey, can I be the voice of reason?  McCain, if he's the president, he's not going to die in office.  He's just not.  Yeah, he's an old guy.  Another old guy, but he's going to be all right. 
[01:01:00]  Anyone can.  That's the thing about the president.  It can happen to anybody if he's the president.  Just stop.  Let's anchor ask Biden if America's days as leader are over.  Now, you recently said, mark my words,  it will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama.  But what worries many people is your caveat,  asking them to stand with him because it's not going to be apparent initially that he's right.  Are you forewarning Americans that nothing will be done  and that America's days as the world's leading power are over? 
[01:01:30]  No, I'm not at all.  I don't know who's writing your questions, but let me make it clear to you.  The fact of the matter is that everyone has acknowledged, from Colin Powell on,  that the next president of the United States is going to be tested,  whether it's John McCain and or it's Barack Obama.  Every president is tested.  And the point I was making is Barack Obama is much better prepared to handle  whatever crisis it's going to be than John McCain.  How does he say that with a straight face?  I mean, sure, there are things that Obama's better at than McCain. 
[01:02:00]  But how could he, with a straight face,  tell me that Obama is more prepared to handle any kind of problem  that might arise with international incidents and foreign affairs than McCain is?  I'll explain.  Not right?  He knows Bono.  Okay.  Good enough for me.  You got U2 playing for free somewhere.  People forget.  I wasn't saying... 
[01:02:30]  About the issues.  I wasn't saying white people aren't going to vote for Obama.  There's plenty of them.  Ken from Jersey.  He needs the white vote to become president.  I'm just saying 98% of black people are voting for Obama.  Do you think any white candidate with the same exact platform as Obama,  the exact same platform as Obama,  would get 98% of the black vote?  There are black people voting for Obama just because he's black.  It's just going to happen.  It's the way it is. 
[01:03:00]  Don't turn it around and make me sound like the idiot here.  So why isn't it happening the other way?  Why are white people voting for this guy?  Because there's white guilt.  There are people that love his platform.  There are socialists that are white.  There are white liberals.  He's going to get a lot of white people voting for him  based on a lot of different reasons.  But black people, for 98% of black people to be voting for Obama,  there's a hell of a lot of them that are doing it just because he's black. 
[01:03:30]  They don't know about his policies, don't care about him,  don't care if whoever else was running against him.  Even if it was somebody that would do better for them than Obama,  if he was white, the other candidate like McCain,  they wouldn't be voting for him.  A lot of people are going to be disappointed too  because they're not going to have that drastic change  that they're thinking is going to happen with Obama.  I don't know.  I mean, there's going to be some change that affects you personally, my friend.  I think there's going to be a slow change because the government works very slowly, 
[01:04:00]  a lot of red tape and crap that they've got to do to get anything passed these days.  But that slow change is going to be detrimental to the country in the long run.  That's what I see.  I just don't want the zombies attacking me.  Well, they're out there.  How do we prevent that?  They're asking for change a little bit more,  and they're not campaigning for Obama.  They want the real change because they are hungry,  and they lost their job at the fast food restaurant. 
[01:04:30]  And the next step is going to be a brick over someone's head in this city.  I'm telling you, walk around.  In the middle of daylight, you'll see very subtly some changes are happening out there.  All right, one more clip.  Biden and the Anchor Woman.  Getting back to the spreading the wealth question,  what do you say to the people who are concerned that Barack Obama  will want to turn America into a socialist country much like Sweden?  I don't know anybody who thinks that, 
[01:05:00]  except the far right wing of the Republican Party.  Okay, Senator Biden, thank you very much.  This is the problem I have with this whole interview.  You know, she has every right to ask those questions.  Yeah.  And then Obama's people got mad.  And what do they do?  They're stumpering.  Officially, they took their advertising off that station.  Yeah, they pulled their support from the TV station.  And, you know, it's America.  You know something?  Things like tactics like that, that friggin' acorn,  that whole organization are a bunch of crooked thugs 
[01:05:30]  that want Obama in at any cost.  Lying, cheating, registering dead people,  registering people that never existed.  It's just this thuggery going on.  What does it say when they tell you,  you don't agree with us, guess what?  You're not getting anything from us.  And that doesn't bode well for the next four years,  or eight, or whatever.  McCain supporters walking down the street with McCain signs  getting assaulted verbally and physically. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  It's just, there's thuggery taking place.  And if that's the kind of change that we're looking at  in this country, I don't want any part of it.  We'll check in in a month or two.  It'll be business as usual.  Well, we need the inauguration, you know.  That's true.  Stumpbrain, you're going to vote for McCain, obviously.  Yes, sir.  How many jokes do you think will be made about the inauguration  and what they'll be calling it? 
[01:06:30]  Did you read that on your website?  What?  Did you read that on your website this weekend?  N-word mania?  Yeah.  I was on some of the more extreme websites over the weekend.  Well, it is the internet.  You're allowed that freedom.  I do go there.  Yeah.  And, yeah, you know what it is?  That's why I look at all sides.  I've been to some very liberal websites that are very upsetting.  And I've been to some very far fanatical right websites. 
[01:07:00]  And I've been to some extremely racist websites.  And I've been to pro-Obama websites.  That's where I hang.  Just getting a little feel for everything.  I'm on the internet.  You know what it is?  It gives you a feel of what's going on in the country as a whole.  Because you're not going to get that from one website.  You're not going to get it from pleasant websites.  You're not going to get it from that.  But I went to, yes, I did go to N-Word Mania.  And I must say, you have to laugh. 
[01:07:30]  It's so hardcore.  Why am I looking at a black version of Charlie Brown?  Charlie Brown is one of the avatars.  The avatars are a scream, some of those.  But you could get the same thing.  And this is what I'm talking about.  You could get the same thing on the opposite end of the spectrum.  Where it's a black-run website that is nothing but hate, literal hate speech against white people. 
[01:08:00]  Saying that white people need to be killed, eliminated from the face of the earth, by black people.  Those are some sites.  And then other sites, you get the other side of it.  But those sites aren't easy to find.  No, they're very easy to find.  Really?  Very easy to find, dude.  What's the search word?  Anytime you put racist terms into Google.  Yeah.  Any one.  You'll find it.  What?  You put cracker in.  Honkymania.com?  Where am I going?  Racist, cracker, things like that. 
[01:08:30]  Just derogatory terms.  And you'll find them?  And then for black people, there are derogatory terms.  For Asian people, there are derogatory terms.  Whatever.  For gay people.  And then you find these websites that are either pro or con.  And I find the real dark humor in some of the awful websites that people would say are really bad.  One of these websites shows nothing but videos.  They have whole sections of videos of just surveillance cameras in various stores and places of business with people just robbing them. 
[01:09:00]  And getting beaten over the head and fights and other things.  And some of the terminology is I've never heard it.  I thought I was on top of things.  Are you a Gold Club member yet?  No, I'm not.  What's your status on these sites?  I'm not a member of any of these sites.  Are you a moderator at this point?  I'm what is called a troll.  I'm a troll.  Where are you at?  Are you a moderator?  I'm a moderator.  Are you buying the website through some phony corporation? 
[01:09:30]  Where are we at?  I'm not a moderator on N-Mania.  Stop it.  I'm looking forward to just being over at this point.  It's exhausting.  It really is.  Just exhausting.  It really is.  Then we can get back to talking about boobies again.  Yeah.  877-212-018.  Phone's lit.  We'll try to answer more of your calls after the break.  Also, I think we should have some fun with Jacktober.  Jacktober.  We only have a few days left in Jacktober.  So we're going to feature a show out of Boston today. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I want to say good morning to everybody listening on BCN.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, it only took an hour and a half.  But we have today's problem.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  When you talk politics,  Oh, man, does it get the phones a-ringing.  Yep.  Problem is, we can't go to the phones right now.  And there's Tim over there plugging and unplugging things.  Damn, and they were all lit up and everything. 
[01:10:30]  They were lit, my friends.  Blinking.  People wanted to attack.  Oh, they had some problems with some of the things you were saying.  But then a few people were agreeing with you, Anthony.  I know.  People, uh, that's how the election goes.  And you can't change anyone's mind, really.  You know, like anything else.  You could babble and babble about your own personal likes and dislikes as far as the election goes.  And then someone's going to disagree with you.  And then you're just going to stay not agreeing. 
[01:11:00]  I hate to say it.  I, uh, I just don't care.  Yeah.  You know what I'd rather talk about than Obama and McCain?  Tiger Woods 09.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Having fun on that one?  Shot my first, uh, under 50 round.  That's right.  Under 50?  Yep.  49, baby.  You're kicking ass.  Not really.  No?  There's a lot of cheaters online.  How do they cheat?  Dude, there's, there's like a daily tournament.  That's where I hang.  And, um, I shoot a 49. 
[01:11:30]  I'm in the top 100 for the world.  Actually, I was like top 50, I think, yesterday.  Wow.  And then, uh, you know, the leaders are 41, 42.  It's like, stop.  My 49 can maybe turn into a 47, 46 if I had a lot of luck.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're doing to shoot a 41.  There's gotta be a lot of cheating going on.  Cause I got craps and everything, man.  I'm, I'm hardcore now.  Oh, really?  You know, my, my chick thinks I'm completely insane.  She always, she knows I'm insane, but now she thinks I'm really insane. 
[01:12:00]  Cause now it, you know, my video gaming was just fun.  Like, oh, Tiger Woods.  I grew up caddying and playing golf and I play all the golf games.  You used to play the golf games.  I played that one.  Sure.  So, uh, I don't know.  A few days ago I asked her for a pen and a piece of paper.  She goes, why?  And I turned on the game and now I'm like, now I'm making little like graphs and charts  and like, okay, like if 130 yards out, I hit this club into a five mile an hour wind.  And this is where landed on the green. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  Let me mark that down for the next time I have this shot.  Okay.  So you're crazy.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  And then I like a map out the greens.  Okay.  Like, all right.  If I'm going to pitch into the screen, I know it goes from left to right.  You know, all this dumb stuff that most people would never do.  You would never do that.  Yeah.  Because they just play with their friends a couple of games and go, all right, let's see  what's on, you know, cable now.  So you know what it is?  With any video game, everything is self-contained in the game.  You don't need pencil and paper.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  To pull out like that and starting to graph stuff is a little obsessive. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, I know.  So, but I don't play a lot of video games, but when I do, this is, you know, I get into  it.  Yeah.  Like the King of Kong and all that stuff where they show the Donkey Kong.  We talked about that documentary a bunch of times and they have all sorts of like Sharpie  marks on the TV screen and stuff to figure out everything.  Now, I'm one of those guys now.  I'm taping.  I'm not taping stuff on my nice TV.  On your monitor or on your TV.  No, but I enjoy it. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Why don't we do some Jacktober?  I'm really mad.  The phones are lit.  What happened?  Does anyone know what happened to the phones?  Obviously, too many calls came in.  Just shows you how great we are at doing radio because we can just go with the punches.  You have to.  This segment was all about, all right, now let's take.  Now let's take phone calls.  What's going on in there?  Yeah, that'll help.  Jesus.  Sometimes, you know, you guys.  I got a joke or two. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, it just.  Yeah, that's what you want to see.  Three guys just staring at the back of a piece of the equipment.  That's what's going on right now.  It's just a lot of staring.  They unplugged and plugged it back in.  Yeah, that'll make it work.  And clicking buttons that I've already tried.  Dude, we were going to go phones right here.  Look, everybody has an opinion.  They want to yell at Anthony.  They want to agree with Anthony.  You might be able to go to those phones.  Yeah, I don't even know what they're.  Unscreened.  They're all good.  I don't put bad things up.  What's wrong with the phone lines we got?  We'll get back. 
[01:14:30]  Line one.  How about we get back to the politics when they have it all figured out?  Line six.  I'm not going to the phones because I'm going to be frustrated because they're.  They're.  They're.  One line.  Danny's still going.  All right.  Hey, Sam, how are you, buddy?  Good.  How are you?  Thanks for coming to the party on Saturday night.  It's an excellent time.  I took note of who was there and who wasn't.  So I want to thank you for being there.  Yes. 
[01:15:00]  I started going through through my MySpace.  Yeah.  And I haven't.  I haven't looked at my MySpace in, I think, a year.  Wow.  Probably a year.  Wow.  So I started going through it and just like deleting a lot of things and clicking on a  few and, you know, returning some from people I know and things like that.  And I saw a picture of our young Sam on a fan's site, on a fan's MySpace page.  And his hair was so short.  Yeah, I know.  And it looked weird.  Like I was looking at him and going like, ooh, that's Sam. 
[01:15:30]  That's like it would.  If you cut your hair off now, you'd look so strange.  I know, I used to, because every three weeks I used to get a haircut and go with the number  three on the buzzer.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  So it was always really short.  The number three.  The number three.  I don't know how long that is, but it's pretty much all the same on all those hair buzzers.  You've got like a Nerf basketball on your head now.  Yeah, it's really cushy.  It's unbelievable.  It's very lamb-like.  You scared some of my family at FH Riley's. 
[01:16:00]  I'm sorry.  That's how crazy your hair is getting.  You and Danny kind of scared them a little bit.  They're like, who are those two?  Really?  They're in this contest that ended six to eight months ago, but they refuse to stop growing  their hair even though the contest is over.  This contest is not over because primetime Sam Roberts is walking out on top regardless.  There's one winner, and it's going to be me.  I like how you're talking about yourself.  Yeah.  Like a wrestler.  Can we do a before and after picture of Sam today?  There's me with Crash Bandicoot. 
[01:16:30]  Look at how short your hair is.  Yeah.  Here, give me a little profile there.  All right.  This is a...  No, I mean, look straight on.  I should have...  Oh, that's the primetime Sam Roberts face he's making.  Yeah, that's the current picture will be up on onaradio.com.  Do a split screen with one of these pictures where he has really, really short hair.  All right.  Sam, we're doing some Jocktober today, huh?  Yes, we are.  Who are we featuring?  I'm so psyched.  Let me do the official sweeper first.  Happy Jocktober, everybody. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  From your friends at the L.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Feel aware out there today there seems to be something in the air besides the fall weather here.  Oh, my God.  Would you just kill yourself?  That is...  I would go home and just swallow a shotgun.  Right up the crapola, it's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded. 
[01:17:30]  I love that.  I think that's fun.  That is fun.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  The hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the L.P. and Anthony Show.  Ha, ha.  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  There was no joy attached to that, Tim.  No.  All right.  I'm heating up, man, because the phones...  What happened, Tim?  Yeah, obviously.  No. 
[01:18:00]  No one knows.  Tim threw his arms up in the air.  Didn't we have everybody in here, like, doing a massive cleanup of the equipment?  And they're really working on it right now, and they're going to have the board working like a dream real soon,  and then they'll get to the phones, I guess.  Like a dream.  Yes, like a dream.  You know how radio dreams work, usually?  Yeah.  Nothing works when they need to.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the phone, they just, they just, the phone just went out.  Yeah.  It just stopped working.  I, you know, this stuff used to drive me nuts.  Now I'm just like, ah, now I'll enjoy the ride until, like, there's no radio signal anymore. 
[01:18:30]  That phone would have, years ago, would have gotten an axe through it from Opie.  No, I don't care.  Now it's just, eh.  My thing is, if corporate doesn't care, really, why should we care?  Yeah.  They do realize they kind of wrecked the show today.  So let them blink.  Because we had about 20 to 30 minutes of really good phone calls, and instead, now we have  to show how great we are as radio guys and move on to something else.  How great we are.  Yeah.  Here's where the talent kicks in.  Yeah.  We'll move on to maybe another company down the road that understands what we need to 
[01:19:00]  broadcast.  I don't know, phones that work and a microphone that works.  Everything else, you know.  Everything else is gravy around here.  As long as you got a mic and phones, you can do a show.  But that's the two biggest problems we have.  We don't have mics that work on a regular basis lately.  We want to do podcasts.  Yes.  We want the same stuff that people that do podcasts from home have.  A mic and maybe some phones.  The CD players don't have to work.  We don't even need lights in the studio. 
[01:19:30]  We can do it in the dark.  We can do it in the dark.  Who cares?  So, another email to corporate.  Oh, boy.  I'll show them I mean business.  Nothing changes.  No.  Hey, so we feature Lander in the morning.  Yeah.  Lander in the morning.  He's an example of a guy that probably should have retired.  How many years ago?  About 20.  About 20?  Looks like Paul McCartney in this picture.  Radio guy's got to know when to retire.  And John Lander's one of these guys. 
[01:20:00]  He used to be pretty good, huh?  Stump Brain.  I do remember he used to work here in New York City.  At one time, he was the highest paid DJ in America.  In America?  And he was on Oprah's show as the highest paid DJ.  He had a 20 share in the morning in Houston.  Wow.  We had a 30 share in Cleveland.  Wow.  We didn't get no TV coverage for that.  No.  We got TV coverage for other things.  Oh, yeah.  That's why.  We had something like a 30, like a 35 share in Cleveland.  Wow.  And then a couple weeks later, we had no jobs. 
[01:20:30]  That's how we roll.  We had a no share.  That's how we roll.  Yeah, that's how we blow things up.  That's right.  All right, so Lander in the morning, he's hacking it up at mix, huh?  Yeah, he's kind of a woman.  What do you mean?  Like, he's very, I don't know, he sounds like a woman.  Really?  Yeah.  He used to have a really good radio voice, right, Stump Brain?  Yeah.  He had one of those smooth deliveries.  I think he's trying to go young, like he's trying to, because he's on a mix station. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  And they're playing a lot of, like, young teen hits.  Every city has a mix station, so.  All right, here we go.  So, John Lander, Lander in the morning, with Kelly Malone and Alicia Love.  Alicia's a stand-up, huh?  Yes, Alicia is their stand-up.  Is she a whole, too?  Well, I mean, you guys be the judge.  I'm not here to judge.  I'm just here to.  All right, well, Lander wakes up in the morning with Jessica.  They talk Halloween.  Ooh, I like Halloween.  Yeah.  Are you, Sam?  I love Halloween. 
[01:21:30]  Hi, good morning, Mixed Night.  All right, first of all.  Whoa.  What are they?  He's texting something.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey, good morning.  Hi.  Hey.  Hi, good morning, Mixed Night.  Eight, five, who's this?  This is Jessica.  Jessica, let's all wake up together.  Let's all wake up together.  Oh, jeez.  All right, and let's not snap a bra strap or something here. 
[01:22:00]  Hey.  Easy.  What did that mean?  Yeah, what does that mean, Sam?  Because, you know.  You study this stuff.  What does that mean?  You're all stretching in the morning, go, whoa, don't stretch too much, yo.  So if she's a booby monster and she's stretching, she might pop a bra strap?  Yeah, but most women don't sleep with their bras on.  Yeah.  Maybe they put it on their bras and then they stretch.  If you were sleeping with John Lander, you would sleep with your bra on, your winter  coat, everything.  Yeah.  A snowsuit.  Steve from Bayshore has already got a new name for the show, Blander in the Boring. 
[01:22:30]  Blander in the Boring.  Nice.  Let's not snap a bra strap or something here.  Hey, what's up with Jessica?  That's funny.  I'm on my way to work.  Yeah.  Oh, you sound absolutely thrilled.  I am.  What are you going to be for Halloween?  You didn't declare.  Oh, I don't think I'm going to dress up.  I got a monkey costume for my son.  That'll be good for him.  Also known as the...  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Right. 
[01:23:00]  Enough said.  I got a monkey costume for my son.  That'll be good for him.  Oh, good.  You're going to say for yourself.  Oh, God.  Did you hear the whole...  Wait, what?  She said good for you?  She goes, I think it was either that or aww, cute.  Yeah, there's two of them.  So one came in with the aww, cute, and the other one said, I thought it was going to...  You were going to say for you.  Not for your kid, but for you.  Oh.  That would just be silly.  What's cute about a monkey costume? 
[01:23:30]  You see a little kid.  He's probably...  Monkeys are cute.  Not really.  You know?  We had that dumb monkey in.  That was cute.  That little...  What was his name?  Mikey.  Mikey.  Mikey wasn't cute.  Mikey was adorable.  Mikey was too old for his diaper.  What?  He had a diaper on.  Mikey did smell a little bad.  Yeah, he did.  But wasn't Mikey cute?  Mikey would hold your hand.  Yeah.  And look at you with the monkey eyes.  It was cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think I'm going to dress up.  I got a monkey costume for my son. 
[01:24:00]  That'll be good for him.  You're going to say for yourself.  So why is it funny because she said it's for my son and then someone said, well, we thought  it might be for you and then Lander laughs at that.  In this weird high pitch.  You're right.  It is very feminine.  His voice sounds very feminine.  Is he doing hormones or something?  Yeah.  Maybe he's wearing bras, apparently.  That's what you were going to say for yourself.  Well, I've decided I'm going to be a pimple. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  How do you do that?  Well, I'm not going to declare.  I'm not going to say yet.  Are you going to be like all red and then spit white stuff out of your mouth?  Well, you'll have to squeeze something.  No!  Yeah.  You have to.  Well, I mean, you do that.  I mean, right?  Why is he being?  No!  I'm getting the vibe already because he was on here in New York and he was very  safe and like kind of morning zoo-ish, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like dirty old man jock.  Yeah.  You're going to have to squeeze something.  Yeah.  You're going to have to squeeze something. 
[01:25:00]  Very creepy.  Yes.  No!  Oh!  The holes are always the same.  It's just.  That's a good sign.  The same mold.  Now there's no one working on the phones.  What does that mean?  They gave up.  All right.  They just ran out of the building.  They're on break.  They're on break.  Do people realize what would happen if we just gave up?  Stop giving up around us.  We haven't.  Where?  Yeah.  Why isn't it?  Oh, here's Tim. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, that's good.  Oh, no.  There are wires.  There's a new guy.  Apparently a man cow had walked in.  He's helping him out.  He's just nodding.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Tim is explaining the problem through his alcoholism.  And this guy is.  Yeah, there you go.  This guy is, you know, the suit guy going, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Steve, what do we know on the phones?  I see we brought in the heavy hitter.  Yeah, we got a heavy hitter in here.  That cable that they're holding in their hand, apparently it's been, you know, like it's had 
[01:26:00]  like a short in it for some time.  Oh.  And it's connected to a device that is right in here by you.  So the quick alternative is to find a very long cable that reaches from Travis's room  all the way in here.  A Cat 5?  Great.  Yeah.  Is that what they're looking for?  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  I'm in high school again trying to get my car to work so I can drive to school.  Great.  Jump it.  That's what they got going on.  They're using jumper cables.  Nice.  Yeah.  Fix the phones.  All right.  Uh, Lander and the gang do the list of bad candy bit.  We did that, Sam. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Remember when Kevin Smith was in and you guys were all talking?  And remember I said how hacky and awful this was and I ran through it really fast and  acknowledged that it's just a bad radio bit.  They didn't go, like they spent a little more time on it.  Yeah.  I just brought a couple clips in though because I wanted to, you know, say that we're not  the only ones doing that stuff.  All right.  Lander in the morning up there in Boston.  The candy you hate to get for Halloween, us trick-or-treaters.  And what were some of the items?  Well, uh, Laffy Taffy, which I guess gets stuck in your teeth.  He did this. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  I don't like Laffy Taffy.  I never liked Tootsie Rolls.  So this is candy that you hate to get.  Tootsie Rolls is number seven.  Yeah, I bet.  I like number eight.  Miscellaneous wrapped hard candy.  Yeah.  You know where they just have that generic packaging on it?  Yeah, forget it.  And they literally last for about two seconds when you put them in your mouth?  Dum-dum lollipop.  This is what it's like to listen to girls talk about tampons.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  That would be more interesting, to tell you the truth.  Uh-oh.  Just like when Kevin Smith was in.  Here comes the big wire.  All right.  The wire is going to be run from Opie.  This is exciting. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  I wish we were taping this.  Mm-hmm.  We were taping.  Where does the wire go?  We have to make sure that it works for us.  Oh, they have to make sure it works for us.  All right.  Take your time.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Phones are just ringing off the hook.  Yeah.  You can't answer them.  It's wonderful.  They literally last for about two seconds when you put them in your mouth?  Dum-dum lollipops.  Yeah, those are dumb.  I would describe them as the red-headed stepchild of lollipops.  Yeah, that's so true.  Oh, good gravy.  Dum-dum lollipops.  That's wonderful. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  It's very funny, though, because, you know, like a red-headed stepchild is sort of the  one that's more ignored or liked less.  Is that it, Sam?  Good.  Thank you for that.  But it's a lollipop.  It's not a kid.  Yeah.  Why do we have more audio from the list of bad candy bit?  Because.  Didn't we do enough with that?  No, you know, we did some, they did some, and it's time for the listeners to judge for  themselves as to who's better.  But good news, Lander and the gang and the bad candy bit with a hammering punchline? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  You got to end on a laugh, you know what I mean?  Call me crazy, but I think it's not going to be hammering, huh?  I guess it's a matter of opinion, but.  A complete lack of hammering is right around the corner, people.  They're tapping a tack in.  I mean, that would be a matter of opinion, but I'd say hammering.  All right.  It's October featuring Lander in the morning.  I hate Necco wafers.  I'm sorry.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Oh, wow.  What?  No.  Oh, my God.  What?  No. 
[01:29:00]  I thought you were voting for McCain.  It's like the same excitement.  Necco wafers.  Necco wafers?  Like, that would be a shock.  Necco wafers suck.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey, Obie.  Come on now.  There's nothing good about Necco wafers.  Nothing.  You're crazy.  I like them.  Yeah, but you wouldn't go out of your way to buy one?  I haven't had one in quite a while.  Exactly.  Wow, you really like them.  That's good.  Whatever they did made the TV go off.  This is like when the Three Stooges re-plumbed a house and water was coming out of the stove 
[01:29:30]  and the lights.  Oh, my God.  And Curly built himself into a cage.  Yeah.  In the tub?  Yeah, in the tub.  All right, well, we lost the TV.  Because it kept leaking.  So now we lost the TV and the phones.  Yeah.  Wait, answer the TV.  Yeah, answer the TV.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Carol Ann? 
[01:30:00]  Hey, that's good.  Oh, gosh.  Mm-hmm.  All right, well, let's get to the hammering punchline.  Yeah, please.  I hate Necco wafers.  I'm sorry.  Oh, wow.  Really?  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, come on.  You know, and nobody, you know, I went to this one house.  They had a bowl of Jell-O.  You had to reach in and grab just this.  No, you're not making crap up.  No, you didn't.  That's stupid.  No, you didn't.  There's real stuff that people used to do that you could say. 
[01:30:30]  No one had a bowl of Jell-O and you scooped your hand in it.  Yeah.  You had the old lady baking the cookies and threw a couple in there with no wrapping.  The dumb change.  I mean, there's a million little Jell-O.  Jell-O.  Jell-O.  Bowl of Jell-O.  You know, and nobody, you know, I went to this one house.  They had a bowl of Jell-O.  You had to reach in and grab just this.  That was your house.  Don't go to that house.  George Harrison's tax.  98.  That was a mistake.  That was the hammering joke. 
[01:31:00]  Hammering.  And if we've taught you guys anything, it's fine, Jocktober.  End on a good out and then hit that sweeper.  Hit the sweeper.  You're out.  Tell them what they're listening to after that great line.  You lean back in your chair, you take your headphones off, and you look at each other  and go, nailed it.  Nailed it.  Jell-O into the sweeper.  Yep.  Listen for the out.  This one house, they had a bowl of Jell-O.  You had to reach in and grab just this.  That was your house.  Don't go to that house. 
[01:31:30]  Mix.  98.5.  Don't go to that house.  Don't go to that house.  J-Mex.  Opiate Anthony.  Couldn't hit it quick enough.  Oh, two, two.  Jell-O.  Why is Robert Kelly with Alicia Love?  Well, Robert Kelly has been on Lander's show a few times.  Oh, frequent guests, so we're burning another bridge for old Bobby, are we?  Oh, Bobby, you're going to have to make a choice.  Oh, Bobby.  Last appearance on Lander in the morning would be Friday.  That would be their life.  Oh, oh, okay. 
[01:32:00]  That was their life.  Oh, well.  And what did E-Rock bring us?  Nothing.  A Q-Zoo TV ad from 1990.  Is this featuring Lander?  Yes.  Yeah.  Same guy.  1990.  Yeah.  Wow.  18 years ago.  In Houston, where he got a what share?  He had a 20 share at one time.  Yeah.  Holy moly.  Yeah, well, that was the time when there was no iPods.  Yep.  Try doing it now.  93 Q's morning zookeeper, John Lander.  With the boss on vacation, we thought we'd give away another five grand this Thursday morning. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, that old gag.  Hey, the boss is away.  Let's break in and steal money and give it away.  That's like a Rocco bit.  Dude.  Remember what Rocco used to do?  Yeah, the tickets are in the PD's office.  Hey, cowhead.  Crawl over the top and get the tickets so we can give them away at five o'clock.  We're going to be rebels.  Who cares?  We've been running a promo all day.  This is off the cuff stuff.  Yeah.  We're sneaking now that the boss is gone. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, it's the worst.  Then he steal the station van and he wasn't giving it back until he played like the latest  Aerosmith song or something.  Yeah.  But he was broadcasting from the van.  Like, wouldn't they just stop the signal and call the police?  Cowhead, I'm on the lam with the Rocco bus.  Like, the station wouldn't just pull the plug and call the cops.  And then he was picking his new...  Will you go arrest Fatso and get our dumb Rocco bus back, please?  And then he was picking a new on-air partner by just naming a random seat in Fenway during 
[01:33:30]  a Red Sox game.  And that person was going to be a sidekick.  Wow.  And coincidentally enough, he'd worked at like ten radio stations prior and was a radio guy.  He had ten years of radio experience.  Wasn't that great?  Woo.  How lucky.  Yes, Sam.  He must have gone...  Wow, he could have been a mechanic.  Yeah.  He could have been anything.  He could have sucked on the air.  He could have been a mother of four.  Yeah.  Could have been some chick.  Another one on the way.  I don't know.  But it turned out to be a radio guy.  Hey, today we're going to just pick a random seat. 
[01:34:00]  Are you?  Oh, that phony radio stuff.  Speaking of the AF days, I got my spies and rumor has it, I'm trying to confirm, there's  someone we've made fun of on this show for the last ten years that we might have to stop  making fun of.  Because I'm hearing that life has gotten so bad that he might be a greeter at a supermarket.  Oh.  And if that's the truth, this is where I show I do have a heart, we're going to call it 
[01:34:30]  a day on making fun of him.  We would officially put a stop?  We would have to.  If that's true.  We would have to.  A greeter?  That's what I'm hearing.  I'm trying to get it confirmed.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, that'd be aisle four.  Okay, my pleasure.  Produce, I don't get it.  I don't know. 
[01:35:00]  Hamburgers?  Yeah.  Or pizza?  Yeah.  What do you want?  Why a meat department?  I don't get it.  Here's the John Lander commercial from 1985, and then after the break we'll have Otto from  Otto and George, and we'll have more Jocktober for everybody.  Yes.  What can they look forward to?  The phrase of the day, my God.  Yes.  All the good bits.  By the way, why was there a lot of bumper sticker talk?  Yeah, they go for some bumper stickers.  They're good. 
[01:35:30]  As we were playing the commercial, which we, of course, stopped within two seconds because  something stupid was said.  Why were they sitting there?  Danny had the video up with a monkey.  I don't know.  Crazy.  It's like the boss is away, and we're giving a giveaway, $5,000, so they're holding the  money, and there's a monkey between the two of them.  It's adorable.  Again, I got to say, nothing cuter than a little chimp.  But I didn't get it.  It's 1985.  That's 23 years ago.  Look.  The monkey came up with the money in its mouth. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, wow.  A trained monkey.  Wait till the boss gets back.  Oh, is he going to be mad?  Yeah.  How do they film this commercial without the boss knowing?  He's gone.  Yeah.  Grab the TV.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  They had to film a whole commercial and get it on the air with the boss just gone.  Gone for a long weekend of golf and taking a week off.  Strippers and wherever.  All right.  Here we go.  And wouldn't you take the money and just split it amongst yourselves?  Yeah.  Why would you give it away?  Yeah.  If you're stealing it, you're in trouble anyway.  We have no boss.  We haven't given any money away. 
[01:36:30]  No.  Let's go into Maura's office and just ransack it and see if we can just find some cash laying  around and give it away.  Let's see how fast we're fired.  When are we going to bury money in New York, by the way?  Ixnay.  What?  Just don't want to talk about it.  Not yet?  No, not yet.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Is that a tease?  Could be.  Okay.  Got to get us a chimp and a hole.  No.  We have a really good idea, actually.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  We do.  All right.  Here's the commercial.  93Q's Morning Zookeeper, John Lander.  With the boss on vacation, we thought we'd give away another five grand this Thursday morning.  Now, piece of cake.  Put your radio on 93Q.  That's 92.9 FM.  Listen at 710 Thursday morning.  I'll announce the birthday in this envelope.  If it matches yours, you could win five grand.  It's so easy, a monkey.  It's a little too organized for a, you know.  For a theft.  For a post-theft disposal of cash. 
[01:37:30]  You've got a time you've got to listen to.  You've got to send in your name.  Wouldn't they just...  All the names are in envelopes.  Wouldn't they just go, look, you better call now.  We'll get your name and send it right out because they're probably going to take this  money back if they find out.  Yeah.  Because I stole it.  Yeah.  Because the boss is gone.  The boss is gone.  That old gag.  The boss is away.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Did we ever do a boss is gone radio bit?  No.  Anytime the boss was gone, it was because he was suspended because we did something bad. 
[01:38:00]  That's the only time I could think the boss was away and we couldn't comment on it because  so were we.  Well, there was a time that a couple had blank sex on the leather chair that was in Ken's  office.  Right.  And he was gone.  Yeah.  The boss was gone.  So what did we do?  We had a couple have sex on his really nice...  On his couch.  Leather sofa.  Leather sofa.  That's just like Lander.  Of course it is.  Hey, the boss is gone.  Yeah.  We're the kings of the boss is gone bit.  Birthday in this envelope. 
[01:38:30]  If it matches yours, you could win five grand.  It's so easy a monkey could do it.  93Q means more money and more music.  Somebody's going to win $5,000 Thursday morning at 710 on 93Q.  It could be you.  I hope it was like Wednesday.  Because to, you know, to get away with it a whole week or something.  Yeah.  Maybe the boss was on a two-week vacation.  Ah.  Way outside the country.  Yeah.  I really need to know.  And maybe Iraq could find out.  You think, like, when the boss came back, they had a whole... 
[01:39:00]  Oh, you guys.  You.  What did you do?  Hey, the boss is back.  And let me tell you, he is angry.  We're avoiding the boss all morning.  Yeah.  He's back on vacation.  We gave away about $20,000, so...  Oh, can you...  The boss is money.  Hey, Stump Frank, can you make sure he doesn't walk in the studio while we're broadcast?  Lock that door.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  I don't know what he's going to do when he finds out.  Yuck.  Shut up.  All right.  Otto and George next?  Or just Otto from Otto and George? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  And more Lander in the Morning audio?  Yeah.  As we feature him on this fine Jocktober day?  Jocktober.  Jocktober 27th.  It's almost over.  Friday's it.  Friday's the last day of Jocktober.  We've got to end with a bang on Friday.  I got one for Friday.  Are you really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, good.  And, uh...  Scorch.  Why would he be featured?  Of course not.  He's the best.  I'm kidding.  Somebody...  Do your dressing.  Please.  Somebody that has helped the show a lot is leaving.  His last day's Friday.  Yes.  Really? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  I know who it isn't.  Who?  E-Rock.  Oh.  Because, see, he doesn't do anything.  Yes.  But we continue to pay him.  See, it's like the boss thing.  The boss.  See, we're crazy, too.  We actually keep employees around that don't do anything.  Whack Zanerific.  We are this much removed from doing the same crap.  Same hacky garbage.  That's all you need. 
[01:40:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along.  Look who's in studio.  Otto from Otto and George.  Nice.  Hi.  Otto.  Otto.  Hello, Otto.  A flock of dildos.  A flock of dildos.  That's what Anthony said earlier.  It was a flock.  When they threw him out of the ice at the hockey game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess they're, you know, you don't know what a bunch of them together are called.  Yeah.  Every time I'm in the car, I want to, like, jump in.  But then it's like an hour and a half before I get to the mic.  Yeah.  So I just say something stupid and you go, what? 
[01:41:00]  A flock of dildos?  That was...  I don't remember what we said ten minutes ago.  The show was really weird because when you said that, I thought that was something we  talked about on Friday's show, but it was earlier this morning already.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm still on the turnpike.  We go through material like that.  Yeah, I know.  The phones are dead for the rest of the day.  Thank you.  Thank you, CBS.  For the rest of the day?  Thank you, Viacom.  Great.  Thank you, everybody in corporate, for making our job harder today.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  No phones.  It's not hard enough to compete in this new world.  Are they broken after nine? 
[01:41:30]  On the other side.  Yeah.  No, we'll have phones when we continue the show on.  All right, then we can do that.  Oh, your phones hit down again?  Yeah.  This is a problem every day.  And like I was telling you, I don't care.  Yeah.  And I really don't.  I know the rule.  If you say I don't care, it means you care.  It means you care a lot.  No.  But I really don't.  No.  And it's freeing.  I wish I didn't care years ago.  Yeah.  Because this is a lot of fun not to care.  You just go, ah.  No stress.  Whatever.  Eh, screw it.  A lot of O&A fans came out and saw me in Cleveland. 
[01:42:00]  They were really nice.  Cleveland rules.  I always thought the O&A fans were like savages and dumbbells.  Yeah.  They were nice.  They had that magazine, that Thanksgiving thing we did a few years ago.  Oh, yeah.  You know, sign this.  They go, great set.  And then they move on.  They don't bother you and everything.  You know?  They're pretty cool.  Our fans?  Yeah.  Wow.  I mean, they're lonely guys without women in their lives and stuff.  Right.  But, you know, they didn't bother me a lot.  And, you know, ask me questions about you guys or anything.  That means you got the look. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  What do you mean?  As long as you have the look, they don't bother you as much.  Oh, okay.  You just got to have the look.  And also, what?  A radio show wouldn't have you on up there because they're feuding with us?  Yeah.  Are we feuding with anybody in Cleveland, really?  Yeah.  You don't even know about the feud and you're in it and you don't even know how small time  they are.  I know there was a radio show that took some shots at us out of nowhere and then we beat  them down and what?  They're still feuding?  Well, I was supposed to be on morning.  They're trying to keep the war going?  Yeah.  I was supposed to be on morning and afternoon radio and they said the afternoon's canceled. 
[01:43:00]  They don't want you because you're on ONA a lot.  Wow.  That's a brave radio guy right there.  Yeah.  That would have been some good radio.  Yeah.  Just have me on.  What the hell?  That's a great opportunity to have some real confrontational radio.  How am I involved?  I'm just trying to get my little skinnier.  You go on the show.  He tries to beat you up a little bit.  You obviously hold your own, if not more.  Yeah.  That would make for great radio.  He was probably scared of you.  I did a TV show too down there.  They were terrified.  It was one of those morning shows.  Please don't curse.  Yeah.  Is it the old dude and the young broad? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  It was an old guy.  I think we did that show.  Yeah, we did.  Many years ago.  It was a metrosexual male guy and then a chick and then an old fogey guy.  That's them.  Was it them?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah, we did that.  And they were scared that we were going to do something.  It was funny because I don't even acknowledge we did TV in Cleveland because I thought I  was doing like, I don't know, college TV.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It had that vibe.  Oh, it's live like morning TV.  They're all made up.  I look like a junkie, you know, just crawled out of bed with bad skin and puffy eyes. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, they have all the makeup on.  Yeah.  And then you sit down on that couch and you're waiting to go on and then they try to do small  chit chat with you beforehand and you're just like, oh, God, so how was the trip in?  Yeah.  Why do you care?  You don't care.  I don't care.  I don't want to talk to you.  Yeah, yeah.  They're made up to look like they slept for the last week straight.  And then some makeup artists will come in and just powder your nose real fast before  they say.  Not even that.  You know, we're going live and nothing.  And they had another comic on crap compared to them. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  They had this other comic Harlan Williams on at the same time plugging his date down the  street from mine.  Oh, nice.  Like, which one of us do you like?  Oh, that's right.  Plugging both dates.  It's not a big enough city to, you know, like two big comedy shows.  That city's deserted.  It is like I am legend.  It is the weirdest goddamn thing.  You walk around, there's no people.  Well, that's the downtown that the downtown is just dying on the burbs.  It's weird.  You can walk down the middle of the street and you don't see a car.  I know. 
[01:45:00]  You don't see people walking down the sidewalks.  There's buildings.  They're not like, they're not boarded up buildings or anything.  Yeah.  I assume there's people in them, but you never see people.  You just once in a while see a lone homeless guy just rushing down the street by himself.  No, I call them the homeless zombies.  Yeah, is that right?  You didn't get attacked by the homeless zombies?  That's my memory of the last time we were in Cleveland.  I got hit up for change, yeah.  Of course.  As soon as you leave the hotel, they come out of the woodwork.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, we're in the middle of Jocktober, Otto.  Oh, yes, where we only feature some of the greatest radio shows in the United States. 
[01:45:30]  And you've done a lot of these crappy shows, huh?  I've done my share of crappy local radio.  Let's get the plug out, by the way.  Otto and George will be at the comedy shop.  They spell shop a little weird.  Yeah, they're trying to be hip.  A couple P's and a couple E's.  Shoppy.  Ye olde shoppy.  Is that how they pronounce it?  The comedy shoppy?  They misspell it to be hip.  You know how that is.  Can I have some birch beer?  It's like at the old Bethpage Village Restoration. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to the shoppy.  Stupid olde.  Like people who spell comics with an X.  Yeah.  What is that?  Yeah.  Stupid.  Just spell it right.  Stupid olde-ing days.  How do you say it?  Olde-er.  Olde-er.  Olde-er.  Olden.  Ye olde comedy shop.  Yeah.  Shoppe.  Yeah.  Comedy shop is lucky to have Otto and George at the Holiday Inn in Parsippany, New Jersey  this, what, Friday?  Yeah.  Comedy show. 
[01:46:30]  Cash price for best contest.  Witch burning.  All that.  Pastrami next door at Harold's.  Nice.  Go to J&J Comedy for tickets.  I guess J&J Comedy.  All there.  JJComedy.com.  And then the next day you got Dooley's Pub and Eatery in Old Forge, Pennsylvania.  Hey, Dooley's.  Is that near Valley Forge?  I didn't even know I was working on Saturday.  All right.  All right.  Well, we'll promote the Holiday Inn gig in Parsippany, New Jersey at the Comedy Shop this  Friday with Otto and George.  All right.  We're in the middle of featuring John Lander.  He works for one of these mix stations. 
[01:47:00]  Every city has to have a mix station.  This is the mix station out of Boston.  Yeah.  And we're up to the point where he does phrase of the day.  Yeah.  And he's got the hole in there.  You know, the typical hole that has to put the kibosh on whatever fun is happening, even  though there's no fun happening on this show.  Well, he's got a couple of them.  Just in case.  Yeah.  Two holes.  Yeah.  But yeah, he does phrase of the day.  And I thought...  What does this mean?  It's like, you know, you just have some fun and maybe whatever is the cool phrase of  the day.  All right.  Something you can share with your listeners.  And it kind of really illustrates the type of show. 
[01:47:30]  So, do they give the phrase of the day earlier and then, like, they prompt you to call?  And if you give the phrase of the day, maybe you win something?  Yeah.  Like that type of deal.  He's like a Dr. Seuss character.  I can't even, like, look at him.  Isn't he?  Yeah.  The hair is just wild now.  It's awful, right?  Wow.  Well, I wouldn't say awful.  It's awful.  I'm going to shear him.  Make a sweater.  Shear him.  Yeah.  Here's Lander's phrase of the day.  All right.  Here's today's phrase.  7-20.  All up in my grill. 
[01:48:00]  This is perfect for the road race.  This is perfect for the road, Lander.  Yeah.  Get off my grill.  Isn't that funny?  All up in my grill.  That's the phrase.  If you click on that, you'll get your points this morning.  What points?  You got to get points.  What does it even mean?  How complicated are their contests?  Are they counting calories?  What are they doing?  You got to go on the website and click and type all up in a grill and get some points.  Ah, because they want to drive some web traffic.  We got to drive some traffic over to our website.  It's a new generation of radio.  What are you talking about?  You got to collect points just to listen? 
[01:48:30]  It's a cutting edge.  And what do you get if you have enough points?  You get to have somebody not all up in your grill, that's for sure.  You smart.  It's the green stamp method of giving out some stupid cheap price.  Green stamps.  Yeah.  Save your green stamps.  Right.  How many books do I have for the sewing machine?  It's like Marlboro, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the Marlboro points.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Just bring the entertainment and the people will listen.  Don't make it complicated with having them collect points.  Points.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  So you got to put all up in my grill.  Yeah, all up in my grill.  No, you click on that.  Click all up in my grill.  And get some points.  Wouldn't you just click on everything on the website and collect all the points at one time?  Oh, that's cheating, Opie.  Jeremy, that's from Cleveland.  He's a regular.  He saw you up there in Cleveland?  Oh, he said you killed Otto.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Where'd you bury the body?  That was just awful.  Wham-amp, wham-amp.  I was accused of being a racist by all these black people down there.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, you know, they walked out, oh, he's a racist, man. 
[01:49:30]  We're offended.  It's like, you know, when I see a black and white couple or like a Chinese guy with a little,  you know, a black, a hot black girl.  I see like a large group of people like that.  I don't get angry.  I go, those are hip, erudite, like sophisticated people.  I go, wow, it'd be nice to hang with them.  I don't have hatred, you know.  I cried at that Will Smith movie, you know, Pursuit of Happiness.  I cried.  Oh, I thought you meant I Am Legend when his dog died. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  Yeah, that was sad.  Dog dying usually gets me, too.  That was sad.  I had Earl from Ron and Fez's show.  I had Earl call me a racist.  He did?  The other day.  Yeah.  And then I had a little debate with him and just crushed him.  Was that because of the Obama thing?  Yeah, that's part of it.  He's so like ready for Obama to be president and so like proud and everything, which is  fine, you know.  But for him to call me a racist, I'm like, you know what I am?  I'm honest.  Yeah.  I have my own opinions on things that I kind of cull from different news sites and things. 
[01:50:30]  I know statistics of certain things and I talk about them on the air, honestly and openly.  That's not racist.  That's me being honest.  Yeah.  Earl didn't back it up with anything.  No, Earl had nothing.  Earl went into a reparations rant about how he wanted his 40 acres and a mule and how that  was part of the deal.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what deal was this?  Well, I don't remember signing that deal.  I don't remember Bob Eatman coming to me with that contract and Earl is going to get 
[01:51:00]  40 acres and a mule.  Is he black?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Where are we going to get all the mules from?  Yeah.  There's a lot of goddamn mules we're going to need.  White people.  Better start breeding the mules.  Breed those mules.  Hey, I wanted an alternative ending to I am legend.  I wanted like Will Smith to die first and then just kind of have the dog walking around.  There is an alternative ending.  Where the dog just wanders around for an hour?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It turns into a Disney movie where the dog talks with a bunch of chihuahuas.  Nice.  And it makes a mint.  Nice.  I want to say hi to everyone that was dragged to High School Musical this weekend. 
[01:51:30]  Barely a few people.  I know you're out there.  A lot of parents, I think.  I feel for you.  I'm sure that anchor woman's husband had to go.  Sure.  P-whipped guy.  How is he whipped?  I really want to make that a bit.  We're almost there.  We got to just bring everyone on board.  All right.  Here we go.  Another one of Lander's really exciting contests.  Some caller gets a doll.  Yeah.  As we feature John Lander for Jocktober.  Where is this guy? 
[01:52:00]  Boston.  Boston.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now, check it out.  Mix 98.5.  Tell me you want this American Girl doll.  I'm so wanted, Lander.  Oh, my God.  You won.  That is awesome.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  That's Mia.  Congratulations.  What's your name?  Maria.  Maria?  Meet Mia.  Why is that funny?  Hi.  Because...  Maria, meet Mia.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  We're just programmed to laugh any time he talks.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, good gravy.  Shut up.  God.  They are such similar names.  Yeah.  Well, that must be why they were laughing.  Hey, Otto, you've done a few of these shows over the years, huh?  Yeah.  I have.  Yeah.  Fun, right?  Just drop the C-bomb right in the middle of it and watch them crap themselves.  It's not...  It's not any...  There's nothing you can take away from doing those shows other than they stunk and I'm  glad to be out of their presence, you know?  I hope it helped ticket sales, but you don't learn anything, you know? 
[01:53:00]  No, you're not having fun.  You're not like...  It's just very safe, right?  Yeah, it is, yeah.  It doesn't hurt anybody, but it's like, if you're sitting in that seat, you can't have  pride in what you do.  Yeah.  Hitting that bumper.  Yeah.  Getting that...  Shoo, shoo, shoo.  The morning zoo.  Yeah.  Good news, Ant.  He talks about bumper stickers.  Oh, okay.  Boy, all the features on this show, huh?  Yeah.  The phrase, the pays, the thing, this stupid contest, you win a doll, he's stealing money 
[01:53:30]  from his boss, the bumper stickers.  Sam thought this was...  Very busy.  Sam thought this was important enough, he has three tracks of bumper sticker talk.  Well, they spent a solid hour on bumper stickers, so I figured...  We came up with the greatest radio station bumper sticker ever, so why, like, what's so important  about their bumper sticker?  It's not their bumper stickers, they're just more like getting callers to call in and say,  we're going to talk about just various bumper stickers, because you do sometimes...  Wow, that's a great segment.  You're driving.  Like, my other car's a Ferrari, or...  Right.  Oh, oh. 
[01:54:00]  See, because I drive a crap box.  It's like the one good thing about being stuck in traffic is sometimes somebody will be in front  of you with one of those really hilarious bumper stickers.  A bad day fishing is better than a good day at work.  I'll tell you that much.  Yeah, I'd rather push a Ford than drive a...  Drive a Chevy.  Yeah.  That whole rivalry, ooh, watch out, Ford versus Chevy, ooh, that's eaten up.  It's going to be in a cage match somewhere.  Hey, ask me about my grandson. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  I like that one.  Hey, can I f*** him in the f***, please?  No.  All right, I thought I'd ask.  I saw you a sticker.  Why would anyone ask anyone about their grandson?  Yeah.  Like, who cares?  My son's an honor student at blah, blah, blah school.  Yeah.  You barely talk to your own family members.  Why would you ask about someone else's grandson?  You're going to ask some old hag on the road.  Right.  Hey, tell me about your grandkids.  Wow.  David is so smart and just so cute. 
[01:55:00]  I want to just follow one of these old ladies all day.  And just keep asking.  So what else?  What else?  What size shoe does your grandkids wear?  All right, enough.  I'll take the sticker off.  Leave me alone.  How about a bumper sticker for junkies?  I'd rather be tying off.  Yeah, right.  Just gravely inappropriate ones.  All right.  Well, let's.  Nice.  Look.  We can't possibly do as well as John Lander.  He's the king of bumper sticker talk.  So let's listen in there.  Good radio.  He rules. 
[01:55:30]  Hi.  Mix 98.5.  We're talking about.  Hi.  Bye.  Why does he sound gay?  He sounds a little gay.  Hi.  Hi.  Toodles.  Where's his accent?  He doesn't have a Boston.  He made his mark in Houston.  Then he came here to New York.  And then he.  Planet Houston.  And then he went to Boston to kind of just fade away, I guess.  Gypsy traveler.  Yeah.  Hi.  Oh.  Hey, tell me the bumper sticker you saw today. 
[01:56:00]  Hi.  That was very gay.  About how bumper stickers lead to road rage and vandalism, depending on what the content  of the bumper sticker says.  Has this happened once?  Um, let's see.  I remember scraping a Nixon sticker off of my uncle's car back in 72.  Vandalism, depending on what the content of the bumper sticker says.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Hi.  What's up?  Hi.  You know, the funniest thing I've ever seen.  My sister has this bumper sticker for the longest time on her car. 
[01:56:30]  And it said, fat people are harder to kidnap.  And I kept saying, I want one.  I want one.  If you wouldn't tell me where she got it.  Wow.  That is an authentic laugh he's got there.  That is too funny.  You know what it means when someone goes, that is too funny.  Yeah.  It means it wasn't funny at all.  Not at all.  Just talking in code.  Oh, my God.  They're having a serious conversation about bumper stickers. 
[01:57:00]  Bumper stickers.  Bumper stickers.  Howdy.  Economy's going to crap, but let's talk about bumper stickers.  There are some crazy ones.  Yeah.  Sure are, Sam.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Jean.  Hello, Jean.  What's up?  Well, I have a great bumper sticker.  And actually, this is one that I was behind.  And I have to tell you, my children tell me I am the poster child for Road Rage.  Oh, really?  Bumper sticker that I was behind was, I may be slow, but I'm ahead of you. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, my God.  No, they didn't just lose it like it's prior.  Yeah.  Like it's Woody Allen's moose bed.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy?  What the hell?  And I'm sure she is just, when her kids are in the car, she's just so road raging.  Oh, yeah.  You want to see Road Rage?  You can't even really be in the car with me.  Put a hidden camera in my car so I don't even know it's there.  And you will see the definition of Road Rage, the real Road Rage, the one with the epithets 
[01:58:00]  being tossed around, epithets.  I'm horrible.  I will pick out anybody's ethnicity and just scream derogatory words for that ethnicity  because I'm mad.  And it's the only thing I could do that makes me feel better.  And I know it would get to them personally.  Usually, they would own here.  My windows are up.  I'm not stupid.  Is that only when you're in a hurry to get somewhere?  No, it's kind of always. 
[01:58:30]  I'm kind of always in a hurry because it's either to get here, which I have to be here.  I don't want to be here late.  Or to be home, which I just want to get home.  Sure.  So I can't understand people that are in the left lane just kind of 45 in it, in a 55.  And they're 45 in it.  And they're like, don't you just want to be somewhere else than on the road here?  Yeah, moseying.  It's not like you're on a country road looking at the scenery.  Yeah.  You know, just move.  Look at the old World's Fair stuff rusting.  Get out of the way. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  They don't get it.  John Lander has another break where he talks about bumper stickers.  Oh, I want to hear it.  For the people that hate this, this is the last track for today.  There's nobody that hates this.  Worst bumper sticker talk.  Oh, you think this is good stuff, right?  Yeah.  Well, today was a total waste of makeup.  Oh, can you imagine if you saw that on a bumper, though?  Hi, Mix.  Who's this?  Crystal.  Hi, Crystal.  I'm not sure if this really implies to road rage or not for bumper sticker, but I'm the 
[01:59:30]  abbot always has to speed up close enough to a car to see what it says.  Well, this guy was speeding really fast on the highway.  And once I get up to his car, I see that his bumper sticker says, I'm only speeding because  I really have to poop.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen that.  That is too funny.  That's funny.  All right.  I got to run, Crystal.  Uh-oh.  It wasn't too funny.  Uh-oh.  On your...  He goes, that is too...  That is funny.  No, it's not.  The other thing about Lander, you couldn't really tell from the clips, but as I was listening, 
[02:00:00]  he's been in radio as long as he has, and he has the worst edited phone calls ever.  Oh, yeah.  You could tell right there.  It was like, yeah, Crystal, that is funny.  You're going to go.  Yeah.  Like, he obviously...  Let's hear that edit again, because it was like, oh, Crystal, that is so funny.  That is funny.  Go to go, Crystal.  Hi, Mix.  Who's this?  Crystal.  Hi, Crystal.  I'm not sure if this really implies to road rage or not for bumper sticker, but I'm the  app that always has to speed up close enough to a car to see what it says.  Well, this guy was speeding really fast on the highway, and once I get up to his car, 
[02:00:30]  I see that his bumper sticker says, I'm only speeding because I really have to poop.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen that.  That is too...  That's funny.  All right.  I got to run, Crystal.  Click.  Click.  I got to run, Crystal.  That's all edits.  Oh, yeah.  Got to clean up the phone calls, right?  No live calls.  That's what they teach you young bucks.  They don't take live calls.  I used to edit Scorch's calls.  Of course you did.  Hey, at least they have phone calls. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, we don't have...  You know, we can laugh all we want, but we don't have phones today.  Do they give up on the phone thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  I've been giving up on.  Yeah.  I love that.  Ah, no big deal.  The guys will handle it.  That's absurd.  What do you got, Iraq?  Thank God they're not EMTs.  No kidding.  It's just like guy left out two pumps on the chest, and it's like, ah, he's gone.  Call it.  What time?  I don't even care.  We had some unbelievable phone calls coming in today, too. 
[02:01:30]  Tag him.  Tag him.  Tag him.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  All right, we got to take a quick break, because we got Maureen McCormick calling in.  How is she going to be on the phone?  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Oh, really?  See, she's not.  Oh, thank God.  Because we don't have a phone.  No, she can't.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Who wanted to talk to that drugged-out whore anyway?  Well, I did, for different reasons.  I kind of hoped we wanted to see if he could set a new record for having a pseudo-celebrity  hang up on us.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  Oh, you were intentionally going to piss her off? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Apparently, she's got a book out, and she tells about how she used to do coke, sometimes  for sex.  Right.  She would screw around, even when she was on the Brady Bunch, things like that.  As a child, she was doing coke?  Wow.  Yeah, and how her mother and grandmother died of syphilis.  How great is that?  Yeah.  That's like...  You know, maybe when mom's dragging herself around on the carpet like a poodle, it's 
[02:02:30]  time to take her to the doctor.  Yeah.  And grandma's doing the same thing.  Yeah.  That's what killed Al Capone, syphilis.  Who dies from that now?  Who dies from syphilis?  Yeah.  Even though it was, what, the 70s or whatever?  Yes.  But who died from syphilis in the 70s?  I know.  All too busy catching AIDS.  I have the Black Plague.  Yeah.  Get somebody else to play Marsha.  The Black Plague.  What I hate about these books, they write them way too late.  Yeah.  Yeah, now no one cares.  Oh, right. 
[02:03:00]  Like when she was all hot and everything.  Did anybody see that show Celebrity Rehab last night?  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  Yeah, I hear people are...  Rod Stewart's kid, the guy from Taxi, what's his name, Conway?  Oh, he's a mess.  He's messed up.  He's been on a lot of reality shows in the last five years.  Broken back.  He's just a mess.  Yeah.  Kenicky.  Kenicky.  Jesus.  He's Kenicky from Greece.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're going to finish with Otto.  After the break.  Let's not forget, Otto's got a big gig Friday night. 
[02:03:30]  The Comedy Shop-ee.  Or the Comedy what?  Well, it's a holiday in Parsippany.  In Parsippany, New Jersey.  Otto.  Giant Halloween bash.  We'll be there with George.  Yeah.  His little puppet friend.  Yes.  I like you without George on the show.  I know you do.  We get to know the real Otto.  I know you do.  George is going to be all upset.  I like when George is here, too, though.  I feel good.  I feel good.  O-O-B.  What?  Now?  What happened?  George is nice.  I'm just trying to be one of those insufferable rag whore holes. 
[02:04:00]  All right.  Otto and George Comedy Shop at the Holiday Inn in Parsippany, New Jersey.  Go to jjcomedy.com or call 866-552-6633.  Yeah.  Cool.  Or you can go to the Stress Factory and hear Dice do my act.  Oh!  What are you talking about?  See, I'm the guy and the dummy.  All in one.  You might have to explain that after the break, my friend. 
[02:04:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Tim, where are we at with the phone?  They're broke?  They're broke?  They're broke.  We believe that the hybrid is completely shorted out and needs a new power supply.  The hybrid?  Yep.  With my car?  Yes.  Yes.  Why does that happen?  Age?  Yeah.  We think there was a short in the cable that shorted out the power supply. 
[02:05:00]  It's a gonna.  All right.  It'll be fixed tomorrow.  By the way, the problems get worse.  I was just locked in the bathroom for about 10 minutes.  Yeah, I see that doorknob is laying on the floor.  Yeah.  What happened?  I don't know.  You went to open the door and the doorknob came out.  And I'm not paying for that one either.  I didn't rip the door handle off.  It just kind of fell off as I try to leave the bathroom.  Otto, the place is falling apart.  It really is, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we're just gonna broadcast until like the signal officially goes dead. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  And they turn this into, I don't know.  Whatever.  Or some kind of shortwave radio thing for ships or something.  For ships.  Whatever the hell they're gonna do at this place.  Yeah, why not?  I had a mom and Sal over there last night.  Yeah.  Over the house for a little while.  Yeah.  Right.  And I was trying to show my mom the iPhone.  Oh.  You know?  Yeah.  And the various apps, applications.  I had to try to explain it to her. 
[02:06:00]  And she's just, so I'm showing her a few things like the, where I could click on one of the  apps and just hold it up to music and it tells you what song it is.  And then you could just press another button and go to iTunes and buy it.  And I'm showing her the, I have the traffic cameras for all of us.  So I picked the expressway and I show her, look, here's live video of the expressway.  So I know if there's traffic going around.  She was looking at this like I took it back to the 1600s and was showing those people.  My mother is technologically retarded. 
[02:06:30]  She doesn't know anything about anything.  I go, this is, she goes, what is that?  A phone?  I go, yeah, it's a phone, but it's a lot more.  It's like a handheld computer.  I could, I could go online.  I could check that.  Cause then a question popped up about celebrity or something.  So I go, boom, boom.  I'm on IMDB.  I check and I got the name.  She goes, you got that on your phone thing?  I was like, yeah.  And, and, and I could do this.  I could do my banking.  She goes, I would never do that too dangerous. 
[02:07:00]  I go, I go, but, but you go to a restaurant and you'd hand your, your credit card to some  person of questionable residency in this country.  Yeah.  Uh, you do that.  I go, so why wouldn't you do it online?  Oh, I don't know online.  So you handed her the phone to, and told her now you do, you try this.  And what'd she do?  Pick up a rock and try to make fire rubbing it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First she, she, she threw it at the wall, started screaming, and then threw feces at me.  Cause she thought you were some kind of devil or completely spirit. 
[02:07:30]  And then I show, I go, look, I got this one where I hit the, the application and the weather  comes up and I go, it's for, it says my town is right there.  It's the temperature, two day forecast, four day satellite, everything.  And she's like, but I could get the weather on the radio.  Yeah.  I go, yeah, but I don't have to turn, turn on the radio.  I'd be near a radio.  Right.  If I wake up in the morning, I want to know what the weather is.  She had like something to say where, and then like IMDB, I go internet movie database. 
[02:08:00]  You ever had a question and you go, who was that actor?  What movie was he in?  And she goes, I use my Leonard Maltin book.  She has this book.  Like it's, it's the size of a, one of those oldie dictionaries by Leonard Maltin.  And she's got to like cross reference, look through the back, the appendix of the book  and try to find, I'm like, and I'm trying so hard just to go, look, it's technology.  It won't bite you.  Cause I'm so into like any new gadget that comes out. 
[02:08:30]  I get it.  And I would love to, you know, say it'll make your life a little easier.  Uh, uh, things as simple as pictures.  She goes, Oh, Dawn was supposed to give me those pictures a while ago.  I go, if you had a computer in your house, an email, uh, we could email it to you.  Oh, I heard about those emails.  You get ads for like, um, uh, uh, Viagra.  I don't need that.  I go, no, that's spam.  You could filter it out.  Spam.  I don't like spam.  No.  And now I'm trying to explain what spam is and why it's called spam. 
[02:09:00]  Um, she's retarded.  I, it gets me so like, we tried everything too.  Like simple things, web TV, just enough where you could type in high.  She doesn't want to hear it.  Uh, your mom's not alone though.  It's the old people in general.  Oh, her and Sal.  I got three calls from Sal the other day.  Actually, from Sal's butt.  Sal's butt called me three times.  Um, I'm, I'm, I'm, I pick it up.  It says, Sal, and I hear this. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, I, I, I didn't hear that.  Yeah.  I hear, yeah, uh, Ro, no, the turn's up here, Ro.  Yeah.  Oh, I like this song.  So, no, we'll be there in about 20 minutes.  I guess we'll be there.  Okay.  Yes.  Could you fill it up, please?  Premium.  He, and then it hangs up and I'm laughing and then it rings again and it's him.  He goes, oh, you're auto dialed.  Number one.  What does that mean?  I mean, you have the most money in the family. 
[02:10:00]  So he keeps, yeah.  Ooh.  That's what that means.  He kept leaning over and hitting it.  And I just hear him calling, you know, he's listening.  I hear music in the background.  He's listening to old 50s songs and singing along.  Blue moon, you left me standing alone.  Just having the time of his life, right?  Oh, time of his life.  And I'm on the phone like, oh, God.  What is that accent?  Oh, Baltimore.  Oh, Baltimore.  I'm from Baltimore, Ro.  Where's Joseph?  Even though he's lived on Long Island for, what, 40 years or whatever it's been? 
[02:10:30]  He kept saying, he goes, oh, let's go downstairs.  I want to see how your theater's coming.  And my mother's like, it's a theater, Sal.  Say it right.  My mother gets a little nippy with him.  Snippy.  Like, it's a theater, Sal.  Stop it.  It's a theater.  Where's Joseph?  Ding-a-dong-ding.  Blue moon.  Ro, turn it up.  This is what I'm hearing in the car.  I'm on the phone.  It says, Sal.  And I'm just like, thank God you didn't hear something else going on. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  You suck it.  Dang-a-dong-dong-dong-dong-dong.  Ro, your hair is getting tangled in the steering wheel.  Oh, hang up.  Hang up.  Well, I mean, it was the era.  I mean, were they watching the submarine races somewhere?  Yeah, huh?  Vodio-dodo.  Ro.  I can't even say it  Because he's threatened our lives before  Can't even do this bit justice  He's alright now  We made him a radio star so now he understands 
[02:11:30]  He won't start talking about it  I got line of the day  The other day, Ro  Yes, Sal, I know, shut up about it  And was legit too, he killed for us  And stepfather was just  He came in and just  He just killed  But before that, he threatened  He threatened you guys?  Oh, this goes back years  Oh, it goes back years, yeah  I started talking about some of my mom's old exploits  When she was younger  This was before they ever got together  So he was defending his wife's honor  Honor, of course  Because her son was degrading her on the air 
[02:12:00]  He called the show  We're like, oh, Sal  We throw him on the air  And he threatened our lives  If you don't stop, you will be dead  I'm going to kill you  Basically, yeah  Maybe not in those words  But it was very obvious  And then Ope's like, what does Sal do for a living?  He's a union organizer  Oh, okay  We'll shut up now  They've had to vanish you  Yeah  Since I just said that  I went, coming up our phrase of the day  Yeah  Hey, how about some cement shoes?  Yeah  Screw Christmas shoes 
[02:12:30]  How about some cement shoes?  Right  Theater  Those two, though  Oh, my God  I'm telling you  I've said it for a while  There's a market out there  For this tech stuff for older people  I don't know how you do it  It was so, like, crazy  Yeah, the phones with the big numbers on it  That's all they want  That's all they want  Like, the DVD  That's all they want  The DVD players  We bought my mom a DVD player seven years ago  She hasn't used it once  Because she can't  We've had multiple sessions sitting down going, no, you've got to click through the menu  She doesn't understand why she can't just put her dumb DVD in 
[02:13:00]  And this is what they should do out there  Put the dumb DVD in there  And push play so the old people can watch their movies  They don't understand menus  It doesn't happen like that  I remember going over my mother and Sal's  And this is a few years back  And there were  What amounted to probably five remotes laying around  And whenever we wanted to watch something  Sal had to start a good half hour before what we wanted to watch was coming on  Because he'd be  Wait, no, this one  You turn that  No, that's for the cable  Wait a minute  The TV 
[02:13:30]  Now, wait, it's on video six  What is that, Ro?  And I was like  I can't take this anymore  They just, they have no clue when it comes to technology  There's a market  Just simplify this stuff  You would do very well  If a company, like, marketed themselves as that  He just started figuring out his navigation system in his car  Which I'm amazed  You've had it for a while, though, right?  Yeah, and my mother's like  Oh, I don't know  I don't even have one in the car  I don't need it  I have an old Hagstrom map  All right, whatever  Whatever gets you through there, Mom 
[02:14:00]  How are they going to get lost in the car?  Where are they going?  Do they go anywhere?  Well, Sal goes to Mastic  To buy his cigarettes from the Indians  So he's driving in there  It probably looks like a drug deal going down  Yeah  He's going to get his face smacked one day  He doesn't understand  You know, those areas are a little  Dicey  A little iffy  Yeah  So dicey  It's dicey  It's all dicey  What's the story with you and Dice there, Otto?  Did you ever tell it on the air?  I don't remember  What do you mean?  Well, you said that he does your act  He does everybody's act 
[02:14:30]  What's news?  Yeah  So  Now it's mine  Yeah  Well, you know  We started off at the Crazy Country Club in Brooklyn years ago  Then he went out to L.A. and he was doing my nursery rhymes  Which everybody knows that I invented those  And then  No, everyone doesn't  Everybody doesn't?  No  I figured comics know  I mean, the comics know  The comics know where he got that from  We never talked about it on the air 
[02:15:00]  Because people don't give a shit who wrote it  I'm sorry  I got dumped on that one  It's just not  It's just not relevant anymore  But you were doing the nursery rhymes  Back in Brooklyn?  I outgrew that material  And then he was  I guess he saw more potential  More potential than I had  With that particular bit  But the thing that made it annoying  Was everybody asking me about  You know  What happened with you and Dice  And you know  What's the story with Dice?  That's what became annoying  I didn't mind losing the material  You know  He saw more potential  So good 
[02:15:30]  I got Dice and George  Yeah  Coming up  It's great  But I'm anything but bitter about it  You know  I'm still writing  I'm still performing  Big deal  Yeah, hurry up  Write some stuff  I need new material  Yeah  It doesn't make good radio  The fans don't care  They like that  Yeah  Stuff  Gossip  Yeah  They love the gossip  Yeah  Where's your plug?

It was Friday night  Friday night  Okay  Because Saturday didn't exist for me  We did a bit on  We're tired  On my friend Kenny's radio show 
[02:25:00]  About Big A robbing a bank  We made him do a dry run  Burst into the bank  And say  This is a stick  I'll give you all your cash  Wait he did it for your show?  Oh yeah  Oh can we reenact it now?

Big A you got the mic?  Okay  You burst in  I guess it's not one of those  You know you hand the note  To the teller thing  It's you burst in  And announce that it's a stick up  And then you know  Get on the floor  All the features of a robbery  To make it a little more legit  Could he use your gun for this  For a second?  Oh really? 
[02:26:00]  Uh oh  No  Do we have a gun?  Do we have a fake gun  That you have to like  Pull out of your pocket?  I thought it would have been  So funny with Dave  At FH Riley's  When he was totally hammered  To just rack around  In a gun  And hand him a pistol  Drunk as he was  You did say that  He was so drunk  I was laughing  Thinking  Imagine just giving him  A loaded gun right now  He would absolutely  Shoot somebody  Yeah  He was so drunk  And obnoxious  That he would just go  What's this?  Bam bam  And just start shooting 
[02:26:30]  Into the crowd  With that obnoxious laugh of his  Yeah  Okay so Big A  Is going to commit  A bank robbery  Can we do whack shots  Today Tim?  How about tomorrow?  Get those little candles  That they have  At FH Riley's  We'll do whack shots  Tomorrow on the show  Ow  Those leave red rash on you  E-Rock  Would you take some  Whack shots tomorrow  For the people?

[02:28:30]  Yeah  Wow Otto  You're onto something  Yeah  We need more scenarios.  Yeah.  Maybe he can warn us of some impending doom.  This is like improv.  Yeah.  What kind of...  Okay, we need an occupation, a location.  What kind of impending doom where he comes in and warns us of something?  And it's very important he gets the info out immediately.  Travis had a good idea.  He said that Big A should pretend that he's notifying next of kin that someone had died. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, okay.  So he's a cop.  He comes to the door and has to tell the next of kin that somebody has died.  Yeah.  So you're...  Let's see.  It's got to be their stepson.  Your stepson, Steven.  How about...  Yeah.  All right.  Was stabbed.  He has trouble with S words?  S-T.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  When a word starts with S-T, he can't fucking spit it out.  Your stepson, Steven, was stabbed in the stomach.  People are suggesting that he reads David Caruso one-liners from CSI.  It's a little dated, but can we get a David Caruso CSI line, too, for the guys listening in the back?  Big A scenarios today on the O-P and Anthony show.  Thanks to Otto.  He was stabbed in the stomach.  Stabbed.  Yeah.  Stabbed in the stomach.  In Stapleton, Staten Island.  Stapleton. 
[02:30:00]  In Staten Island.  In Staten Island.  Yeah.  All right.  This could take a while.  Oh, God.  Everybody stay still with the stick-up for the pisser.  All right.  So, we got so far, your stepson...  Your stepson, Steven, was stabbed in the stomach in Stapleton, Staten Island.  Yeah.  Never get through it.  You want more?  That's enough? 
[02:30:30]  Do you want to stay here or come with me to the station?  Yeah, there you go.  We could say he was in stable condition, but now he's dead.  Stable condition, man.  After the stroke.  Poor bastard.  Oh, someone's suggesting that he warns everybody of a stampede.  That's a stampede.  All right. 
[02:31:00]  We might have to go with the stampede one next.  All right.  Big A scenarios today.  So, now...  Okay.  Do you have a doorbell or something, Ant?  Yes, I think I do.  I have it.  I got one.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  It's the...  This one.  We're not exploiting his mega-uddy at all, are we?  Yeah, we are.  Okay.  He doesn't mind, though.  It's just a start.  He's a hero on Ron and Fez's show, but you know how to get good radio out of him.  Yeah.  Got to go down this road.  He's got the... 
[02:31:30]  Speaking of Ron and Fez,  is Fez the only one with a secret?  Uh-oh.  Acquiring minds want to know.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  Are we ready for the second Big A scenario?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Here he comes to the door.  The unsuspecting family waiting for their stepson to get home.  He hasn't been home.  And, of course, the unpleasant news.  Yeah.  The bell rings and police officer Big A is there. 
[02:32:00]  Officer Big A?  Yes.  Officer Big A.  All right.  Good evening.  Hi, officer.  Hello.  I just wanted to let you know that your stepson,  was...  was...  Steven was... 
[02:32:30]  was...  was...  was...  was...  was...  Was what?  I forgot he was...  He was...  What?  Was what?  He hasn't been home.  He didn't come home last night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.

He's got to...  He's got to warn everybody that there's a stampede coming.  A stampede of what?  A stampede of steer.  Of course.  There's a stampede of steer. 
[02:34:00]  Um...  You can start running.  Uh...  Yeah.  Let's start running.  Uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Uh...  Let's make it a shorter one.  But we want excitement, Big A.  You hear me?  Hold on.

[02:40:00]  I love it  They got their camera phones  And they email pictures  Of themselves naked  Yeah  Hmm  Want to do this  Want to do this  You wise up real quick  Yeah big A  God damn  Sound like a bear  Sniffing for food  What  Wow  You breathed pretty heavy  Into the mic there big A

[02:41:00]  You alright  You feeling good  I'm alright  I don't think you should be sweating  Because you ran four feet  Yeah  Literally four feet  You alright  Yeah I'm alright  And have what amounts to an aorta  In your forehead  Popping out  Bursting into the room  Jesus Christ  You see that  It's just like  Yeah  Good  Good  Good  Alright  We're gonna do this story  The kids are doing this today  They're sending each other  Naked pictures  It's cute  13 year old North Texas boy  Is facing a third degree felony 
[02:41:30]  Tonight  Possession of child pornography  The boy found himself in trouble  After a girl at his middle school  Sent a nude photo of herself  To his cell phone  We aren't identifying  The 13 year old boy  And his mother  But they say  It's the talk of Sanger Middle School.  He was arrested yesterday on a charge of possessing child pornography  after his mother says a friend, an 8th grade girl,  sent him a nude picture of herself to his cell phone.  I was really just speechless that day.  All of it was happening so fast and the decisions were being made so quickly 
[02:42:00]  and I was just concerned for him.  I think if you're 13, you should be able to have pictures of other 13-year-olds naked.  On your phone, I think if you're a little older, too.  Who ratted him out?  His own mother, was it?  I missed that.  I'm sure some nerd.  Yeah.  He was probably showing the picture around.  Oh, yeah, bragging.  Someone said, yeah.  Oh, God.  Wow, what a little hose bag.  I love that. 
[02:42:30]  She says his football coach took her son's cell phone 7 a.m. last Thursday  when he shut up.  Why?  Why is the football?  Yeah, I'm going to take this.  This is not good.  I've got to confiscate your phone.  Hey, you.  You.  Get over here with that.  Give me that phone.  I'll hold on to it while you change into your shorts.  I'm going to turn this into the authorities first thing Monday morning.  Yes.  Friday afternoon.  Wednesday. 
[02:43:00]  Right.  As soon as I sync it with my computer.  As a matter of fact, all you guys, hand over your phone.  He called the phone 7 a.m. last Thursday when he shut up for practice.  The boy's mother says it was the night before when her son received the picture.  She says the school principal told her she got a call at home about it that night, too.  The boy's mom says the principal called police.  I just want it to go away.  I just don't want him to go through what he's going through.  He's been traumatized by this as well. 
[02:43:30]  Her son spent last night in juvenile detention, but has now been released by a judge.  These kids are not looking at it as child pornography.  Just pornography.  These kids are, at this age, it's, they're curious.  I'm nourishing a case like this.  The boy's attorney, Brent Bowen, believes state statutes protect his client because he's in the same grade as the girl  and falls within the required two years age difference.  That's an affirmative defense.  He says his client didn't ask the girl to send him the picture and that he didn't send it to anyone else. 
[02:44:00]  Wow, that's a weird situation, huh?  Yeah, he just got fucked.  What happens if somebody just sends you a picture?  Wow, you could really screw somebody big time.  You send somebody a picture, and beforehand you call the cops and say there's a picture on someone's phone or something?  Yeah.  Oh, he was showing it around.  You say something like that.  You send him a picture.  Oh, man, that's bad.  The Hickey Jones says it all, though.  This kid is clearly a pedophile, so. 
[02:44:30]  Clearly.  And then the end of the story here.  Good news for everybody, right?  The boy's mom believes the school overreacted.  I feel betrayed by the school.  As a mom, the principal could have called me and said, this is what I've been told.  I'm not out to hurt your son.  Now, earlier today, Superintendent Jack Biggerstaff wouldn't discuss this case for privacy reasons, but he did acknowledge that he has spoken with the Sanger Police Department about this situation. 
[02:45:00]  He also says that a note did go home to all parents warning them about inappropriate use of cell phones.  We call the Sanger Police Chief, Curtis Amex, but he did not return our call.  Of course not.  John B. sent a link from poor Jeff.  What?  Click on it?  Virtually every high school girl in the world poses naked these days, and it turns up here.  Oh, yeah?  Might want to jot that link down so we don't go there by accident. 
[02:45:30]  That's right.  We want to alert, you know, everybody in corporate to not go there.  And, you know, I mean, we get dead links a lot of times.  It's a weird, it's a really, whoa. 
[02:46:00]  Jesus.  Holy mother of fuck.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  That's a legal shot.  Dude.  Dude.  That is the hottest picture I've ever seen, Beavis. 
[02:46:30]  Beavis, we have found the best website ever.  Is the superintendent's name really Jack Biggerstaff?  Jack Biggerstaff?  Really?  Why does it always happen that way?  Is this a legal setting?  I don't know.  The girl was in a bikini.  It's fine.  Yeah.  You know.  I know the laws.  Who cares if she was sitting on a cock?  No.  Just kidding.  No.  Just kidding.  You find another one, Danny?  I say we just do this for the rest of the show. 
[02:47:00]  It's research, right?  It's weird because, I mean, there's nothing really hosted.  So everything you have to click out to.  Yeah.  So I'm just trying to, and it seems to be like.  These are definitely, like, pictures that the girls are taking and sending to guys, and this  website happens to collect them all.  There's no nudity.  Not yet.  No.  All right.  It's been that.  Oh, no.  All right.  Turn off into feedback.  You want a new one?  The links are coming in.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:47:30]  We really, yeah.  High school's fine, by the way.  If, you know, they're stupid and we're left back.  We're only looking for stupid naked girls.  The left back variety?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm.  What do you got?  Oh, Danny just goes, ooh.  Go ahead.  Spin it around.  Let's see.  Let's play a game.  Spin that around.  What?  Russian roulette?  Wait a second. 
[02:48:00]  Ah!  Ah!  All right.  I don't know.  Holy fuck!  Wow.  Look, she's still got baby fat.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That looks legal.  Yeah, no.  That looks fucking like at least 19.  Kazakhstan.  She has Snoopy on her pillowcase.  It's probably...  It's a child.  All right.  Ah!  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  People are amazed that you could speak fluent fucking pig Latin.  Pig Latin.  Yes.  In Florida.  Why don't we take a break?  Goddard George is here.  We got Big A doing a little play acting for us.  Hmm.  Looks like you need a nap.  You all right?  No, I'm all right.  I'm okay.  All right.  No more running.  All right.  I'm all right.  Uh-oh.  Spin that around.  Anthony, you know that house of cam whores?  This needs to be what it looks like.  Holy shit.  All right.  There's a problem in there.  Those are children.  All right.  Not all of them. 
[02:49:00]  Not all of them.  They're children.  They're all like...  Ah, they're fully clothed, too.  The one on the far right.  She's kind of cute.  Look at the ass on the one in the pink.  Yeah.  Look at the ass on the one in the yellow.  I don't know.  Those are children to me.  What about that one with the braces in the middle?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup.  Yeah, regroup.  Regroup.  Whatever you want to call it.  Yeah.  Regroup.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  This is Big A.

[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Four minutes.  Yeah.  Who was the fattest president that William Henry Taft, remember that guy?  I think Taft, yeah.  He used to get stuck in the bathtub, he gained like 200 pounds while in the office.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a major eating disorder.  He was funny.  Taft.  Yeah.  With that stupid walrus mustache.  Yeah.  Otto.  Yes.  A big A.  Big A's right next to you.  Yeah, big A.  Are you going to be Taft for the Halloween party? 
[02:51:00]  That would be good.  Mm.  What are you going to be for the Halloween party?  Probably a hard rock cafe.  Hard rock, uh, they call it a cafe still?  It's too big for a cafe.  Uh, yeah.  What are you going to be?  Party goes from 7 to 10.  Wow.  Woo!  You don't know what you're, uh, dressing up as?  You got an idea?  A big A.  No.  Hmm.  But yeah, I'm thinking...  You have to have an idea. 
[02:51:30]  You're not going to have a costume?  Yeah.  I'm probably going to have a costume, but I just don't know what it is going to be yet.  Nice, uh, waiting for the last minute.  You should dress up as Gacy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I gotta see it.  Yeah, I'm like Gacy, a little clown.  A little clown makeup.  That would be good.  Yeah.  Drag some young dead boy around with you.  Bloody clothes.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, we got a, uh, contest underway.  The Pendulum Contest.  Oh, yes, we do.  We got the hook for the people to bring them on board. 
[02:52:00]  E-Rock?  E-Rock, uh, is getting the original song, Otto.  Okay.  Uh, our own, our own Steve came up with this back, I don't know, like 12 years ago, 13 years ago.  My heart can't stand up.  Yeah.  My heart can't stand up.  My heart can't stand up.  It's going to change me into something that I just can't control away.  You see me come and let you out of my way.  A man's still love and swing and back me out of the way.  Nice, right?  So, we got people remaking the song. 
[02:52:30]  Your buddy should remake it.  Yeah.  You got your buddy over there.  Do you want to give him a plug or what?  Yeah.  Rob Dukes.  Come here.  Hey, Rob.  I don't know if he does song parodies.  No, I figured not.  It was just an excuse to get a plug out for his band.  I'm just trying to do the right thing for you, Otto.  Thank you.  Yeah.  What's the band?  What's happening?  I'm the lead singer of Exodus.  Exodus.  Nice.  Do you like Exodus, Otto?  Yeah, man.  They're internationally great.  They're everywhere. 
[02:53:00]  They're an international thrash metal band?  Yeah, man.  We've been all over the world.  Can I ask you how you got the scar I got?  That's a massive scar from your earlobe all the way down to your chin.  I actually got in a, I got jumped by some skinheads and I got hit with a bottle when I wasn't looking.  How'd you get jumped by a skinhead?  I was drunk and got in a fight with a bunch of skinheads.  Like neo-Nazi skinheads.  Yeah, but you kind of look like, you know, the guy that they would kind of induct, you know? 
[02:53:30]  You kind of look like one of their pals.  Nah, they're fucking, you know.  Yeah, but you have that look like they wouldn't fuck with you.  No, I had like a long mohawk.  I had an afro.  I was black.  You've had that scar a long time.  Yeah, I got one when I was 22.  Wow.  It changed my life.  It was like, you know, it was one of those life-altering moments.  Really?  Yeah.  So you hate white people now?  Yeah, pretty much.  You got to watch those Nazis.  Yeah, man.  Little neo-Nazi guys. 
[02:54:00]  Wow, that's crazy.  Damn.  Ever catch him?  What I heard was he got, he had beat up some kid who was like 15 and set him on fire.  So that kid's older brother went and shot that dude in the face.  Wow.  That's what I heard.  A little street justice.  That's what I heard.  Happy ending.  Is the guy dead?  That's what I heard.  Wow.  Shoot him in the face.  All right.  Bam.  So Exodus.  Yeah.  Is there a website for people to check it out?  Yeah, it's exodusattack.com. 
[02:54:30]  Exodusattack.com?  Yeah.  We have a record coming out tomorrow called Let There Be Blood.  Let There Be Blood.  Nice.  Yeah.  What are the audiences like it these days?  They are long-haired, black t-shirt wearing people that you never see anywhere else.  Yeah.  Like, you never see them at work or walking around during the day.  They're people that I only see at concerts.  Really?  Like, are they bouncers or they just let them kill each other?  They kill each other, man.  Really?  They have this violent...  There's no security at all of that.  Well, they don't let them come on stage, but in that little area where they are, no. 
[02:55:00]  So you're protected, but anybody in the audience could just be scrambled to death.  Who'd you listen to growing up?  Look at Big A working the mics.  I like this.  Look at Big A.  He's better than...  Big A is better than anybody we have on staff right now.  Look at that.  Why would Steve come running in here and make sure the show sounds as good as it can?  John Denver.  He's thrash, right?  What'd you listen to growing up?  I started out listening to Punk Rocket, Clash, and Sex Pistols, but I had switched over  to Judas Priest, ACDC, Black Sabbath, of course. 
[02:55:30]  I listen to everything.  I listen to a lot of jazz now.  I'm not really a metal.  I don't listen to a lot of the new metal.  It mostly blows.  Really?  Yeah.  Any G.G. Allen?  G.G. Allen, yeah, he's pretty cool.  Not his music.  Nah, it sucks, but his ideologically, he was all right.  I wish he had actually done what he said he was going to do.  Kill himself on stage.  Yeah, on stage.  We all know, right?  It would have been a good one.  Yeah, you fucking O.D.  Instead he get pissed, left the stage, wandered the streets, and then did a nice hit of heroin. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Nah, in a friend's apartment, I do believe.  Yeah.  And then some groupies came over and gave him a nice shot of eight.  He died?  Oh, yeah, did he die?  Well, there's like black metal dudes.  One guy blew his head off, and the other, everybody in the party kept pieces of his brain  and ate it and shit like that.  Jesus.  People are fucking out of their minds, man.  Holy shit.  When did we hear about that?  I've heard about that.  I think we talked about it on our show.  Is there dipping sauce with that, or is it just...  Oh, it was a guy...  Some honey mustard. 
[02:56:30]  A guy who...  It's crazy.  A documentary on metal.  Yeah.  And he did our show, and he said, yeah, that's like the craziest band ever.  The lead singer killed himself.  Mayhem.  Mayhem, right.  Yeah.  We actually saw that.  We played with them recently in Europe, but they don't have a lead singer.  Well, yeah, I don't know what the deal is.  That's bizarre.  Black people doing heavy metal is kind of a bizarre concept, isn't it?  Yeah.  Well, this guy kills himself, and then they cooked him up and ate pieces of him and stuff,  and then saved other pieces.  Just completely insane. 
[02:57:00]  Wow.  Someone is screaming, Exodus rules.  All right.  Toxic waltz, baby.  Does that mean anything?  Yeah, it's like their biggest hit that we've ever had.  They did a great remake of Lowrider, too.  Really?  Yep.  Oh, Lowrider.  I heard Barry White's version of that.  It was pretty good.  Barry White and Exodus is going to be a little different version.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  It's no foundry.  He goes, ah, fuck.  All right.  Cool.  Well, we got...  So check out exodusattack.com.  Right on. 
[02:57:30]  And the goatee is very impressive.  He also played in my movie The Telegrappies, my now classic film.  Telegrappies.  He was Tinky Winky.  Tinky Winky.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  The Tinky Winky.  Yeah, the pot smoking.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Very cool.  Awesome.  All right, so we got some Pendulum remakes that came in today.  We got RPI.  He's good for a song every once in a while.  RPI.  And he remade Pendulum in this way.  Hmm.  Pendulum swing at the center of a tangent. 
[02:58:00]  It's the only thing in the key decision.  Let it get, shake it, get it like it.  Yeah.  Pendulum shit.  Don't deliver any pressure.  Need some stuff.  Depends on you, I get you.  Sure you love.  You tear you around.  You do the carbon as a tan.  Then you're gonna fake.  But when you tell you better, all that I can take. 
[02:58:30]  I love you screaming in my ear.  The bank is gonna break.  If you push me one more.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just can't hear you.  My cross can't kill.  You tear me into something.  I just can't control.  If you see me screaming.  But you're out of my way.  Spend your love this way.  The other way.  You tear me into something. 
[02:59:00]  It's almost like a Cartman thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's doing Cartman.  Trying to do a Cartman thing, but not very good.  A little, uh, only the one type of Cartman.  A little Adam Sandler, too.  Yeah.  Very good.  There's, uh, RPI doing his version of Pendulum. 
[02:59:30]  Uh, I apologize to you, sir, because Blue Heeler from Kentucky, he, you know, he comes,  he's very reliable.  He writes, Exodus fucking rules.  And then he writes, Opie, you're in the presence of one of the greatest, uh, greatest thrash bands  ever.  All right.  I had no idea.  Damn.  Look at that.  That guy would know.  Yeah, he would.  Blue Heeler would know.  Yeah.  Uh, the next Pendulum remake comes in from Sugar Jaws.  Sugar Jaws.  Yeah, memory serves.  This is like a really cool bluesy, kind of gritty, Pendulum. 
[03:00:00]  Woo!  That's what I'm talking about.  What's the thing, Gary Moore?  The Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day, another condescension. 
[03:00:30]  Mark you and shock you and gonna lock you down.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  The Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Woo!  Move too slow and the Pendulum will catch you. 
[03:01:00]  Show you and Mark.  Yeah.  That's Sugar Jaws doing his version of, uh, Pendulum.  Thank you, Sugar Jaws.  Didn't like that one?  Big A?  Well, I'm not a big, you know, kind of a bluesy guy.  No.  Big A, what'd you think?  Um, I didn't, uh, I didn't like it either.  Oh.  I'm not into the blues too much.  Yeah.  What are you into, Big A?  All kinds of music, but not blues.  Um.  Like what?  I don't know about rock. 
[03:01:30]  You like the lead singer of the, uh, police?  What's his name?  Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, you mean the person who plays the lute?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Who is he?  What's his name?  What's his name?  I can't remember.  Yeah.  Um, Sting.  Oh, wow.  What about the drummer?  For all you police fans out there, that one's for you.  Thank you, Danny.  Ah, that's good. 
[03:02:00]  Uh, do you know his name?  No, I don't.  Mr. Copeland?  First name's Stuart?  Oh.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  All right.  We got another, uh.  Yeah, we do.  All right.  We're in Sutcliffe.  Yeah.  The, uh.  The next one comes in from Mr. Mountain Dew.  He did two of them?  Yeah, there's two of these.  Oh, look at this. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, they're both completely different.  All right, let's do the first one.  Here it is.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood is getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just cannot do.  You changed me into something that I just cannot do.  If you see me coming, you best get out of my way.  The pendulum's swinging, swinging back the other way. 
[03:03:00]  Because the pendulum's swinging back, swinging back the other way.  The pendulum is swinging, swinging back the other way.  Get out of my way.  Wow.  That's all. 
[03:03:30]  That's great.  Wow.  Oh, that is a good one.  Bravo, Mr. Mountain Dew.  We gotta replay that tomorrow.  Oh, God damn.  Great job.  This next one was actually requested by you guys.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you wanted a certain version.  Oh, right, right.  And you wondered if someone would do this version, and I don't want to spoil the big  reveal, so whenever you're ready.  Another one from Mr. Mountain Dew.  Once it kicks in, you'll see.  Doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly. 
[03:04:00]  Doodly, doodly.  Doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly, do 
[03:04:30]  Thank you. 
[03:05:00]  Like EverQuest music. 
[03:05:30]  Very good.  Totally dual version.  Yes.  Great.  Two very good versions from Mr. Mountain Dew today.  Mr. Mountain Dew.  And actually, if you want to stall before we hit the big closer on that disc, we have a  late entry.  It's being burned as we speak.  Is it good?  I haven't heard it.  It's from the legendary sleeves of the Ron and Fez show.  Oh, shit. 
[03:06:00]  Damn.  Hey, Kirk Hammett.  Was he in Exodus?  Yes, he was.  Yeah.  Chris in Boston saying that and a few others.  Yeah, he's now in Metallica.  No, I know that.  I know he's in Metallica, but he started in Exodus how long ago?  82 to 83 and then he left.  82 to 83 and then he left.  Yeah.  Yeah, he started the band with Gary and Tom, the drummer and the guitar player who are still  in the band.  Yeah.  And then he left to join.  They kicked Dave out of Metallica and they put him in there. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  Very cool.  And that's about it.  The band's been around a while.  Yeah, I'm in the new guy.  I've been there in the band four years.  I replaced the guy who passed away.  So they don't even acknowledge that you are part of the band yet?  No, not really.  I'm serious.  That's what happens with these bands.  Yeah.  I was hearing an ACDC story recently where they still don't acknowledge Brian Johnson.  I'm like, you got to give the guy a break at this point.  He did back in black.  Come on.  Yeah, exactly.  You know.  The old school fans fucking hate me. 
[03:07:00]  Really?  Yeah.  It's not your fault.  I died.  You're just trying to let it continue.  Continue on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They would prefer the band never to perform again because the character died.  Pretty much.  Really?  But the new, you know, like they're, you know, we're trying to get a new audience.  So, I mean, that's how it rolls.  You know what I mean?  So we do new stuff and then, you know, it's heavier than it was.  It's faster now.  They're better musicians.  So it's.  I think we got your version of Lowrider in the system.  We're going to play in a little bit.  All right.  And is that you singing? 
[03:07:30]  No, it's actually the other.  The guy that died.  No, he's actually, he's the guy who quit that I replaced.  Ah, gotcha.  What about those two new tracks you said that are available?  Yeah, I brought in two tracks of the new record.  It's coming out tomorrow.  You can play that.  Brian from St. Louis.  I did hear the Ecstasy of Gold at the end of the Tootally Do version of that song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did a little slight.  Yeah, he did.  Are we waiting on.  Why?  Do we have another?  Okay.  Can we get it? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, let's get a taste of Lowrider from Exodus.  Exodus Attacks.  Or Attack.  ExodusAttack.com.  Attack.com.  All my friends on a Lowrider.  A Lowrider is a little higher.

[03:11:00]  Oh, nice  Fuck them  What makes you menacing when you're on stage?

Everything he does is fun to listen to.  Very good.  And we end the covers today with what there, Danny?  One more to go.  Yeah, this is Johnny Cash.  It's the real thing.  He must have recorded this.  What?  He must have gotten a hold of a DeLorean and knew that we were going to do this before 
[03:14:00]  he died.  Because it's totally not Brother Joe at all.  Okay.  It's not him whatsoever.  It's completely Johnny Cash.  Johnny Cash.  Yep.  All right.  Not Brother Joe.

Everybody's really excited.  We were talking about Fast Days.  But me.  We were talking about Fast Eddies over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  And did you ever go to Fast Eddies?  Oh, hell yeah.  You did when it was something else, right?  The top of the town.  He hated when I made fun of his rug.  Oh, yeah?  He would get really upset.  Please don't mention I'm wearing a toupee.  Hey, it looks like somebody spilled a chef's salad on top of your head. 
[03:26:30]  You're not fooling anybody.  That's my sister's father-in-law, but you're right.  He's cut up eggs there and ham slices.  He was a very cool boss to work for, you know?  Do you remember, did you ever go in there when, like, one of those bands were playing and the  whole floor would, like, shake like you're on a trampoline?  It was too small to have a band.  It was a tiny, yeah.  And that place used to, like, the floor would, like, bounce so much, and it was on the second  floor, that there were nights I would stand right up against the wall, figuring if the 
[03:27:00]  floor does collapse, some of the boards would be left around the edge.  Oh, really?  And I would just be standing there as the firemen are trying to rescue people down below.  I was playing there when they were doing the O.J.'s little low-speed chase.  Oh, really?  That night, my band was playing there, yeah.  What kind of music were you playing?  Basic bullshit fucking rock crap.  Cover stuff?  Yeah.  Cover band.  It was fucking awesome.  What's in that spot now?  Do you ever go to Huntington?  Yeah, I was just there. 
[03:27:30]  What the hell is it?  It's a, it's a, I forgot the name of it.  It's a...  Wasn't it a blues?  Chesterfield or something?  Chesterfield?  I think.  I haven't been there in a really long time.  Chesterfield, they do a little blues.  Yeah.  Yeah, I haven't been up there in a while, no.  I used to draw people for him, didn't I?  Yes, you did.  During a snowstorm, I had it sold out once.  He used to pick you up in snowstorms.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  All right, where's Earl?  Earl refuses to come in.  Why?  Why?  He's too busy.  Too busy.  Does he understand that whatever he's doing is not more important than material for either 
[03:28:00]  show?  Yeah.  And Ronnie will get on Earl about this, especially if Earl redeems himself, because  Ronnie said he was owned.  Yeah.  Hey, Earl.  This is the last debate we had.  Earl.  He rocks in his office.  Oh, wants to know why you won't play?  I have some calls I have to make.  You're doodling.  He's full of shit.  I'm not doodling.  I'm attempting to get some work done.  Oh, stop it. 
[03:28:30]  What kind of phone calls does he make?  Yeah, who's he calling?  What could he possibly be doing, Rochester?  Ask who he's calling.  Awful Jack Benny.  All right, here comes Earl.  Angry Earl.  A little slower Earl.  It's radio.  Yeah, take your time, Earl.  Oh, Jesus.  You're not going to slow down our show, too.  Get the fuck in here.  He got mad at Dave for saying that the other day.  Earl, what phone calls are you making?  I was just doing some business.  Ron and Fez are doing the three before I forget.  Yeah, but you know Anthony owned you, and then Ronnie pointed out that he got owned, right? 
[03:29:00]  I thought I held my own, but a point for the review, yeah.  I listened to Ron and Fez.  I listened to the whole breakdown of the discussion we had.  And when you apologized to me, it was probably the best moment where Ronnie was just like,  you just apologized to him.  Now, this stems from, well, last week, Earl called me a racist on the Ron and Fez show.  Well, there have been moments where you have said things that were just openly racist. 
[03:29:30]  Openly racist.  Name one.  Do you have any examples?  Just one.  Name one.  Well, you always make the situation, like particularly with me, let's say if there's a situation,  let's say with Reverend Al or whatever, you'll make it a point to say, hey, Earl, look at Reverend Al.  And just kind of point out to, like being the, I guess the resident black guy,  that you have to point out that a black guy is just causing trouble.  And I'm like, big deal.  Well.  It's Al speaking as Al.  I have heard you defend Al in the past, so I think I should point out whenever he makes mistakes 
[03:30:00]  and is being an idiot and a racist himself, I think I should point that out to you.  Well, and I've defended Al.  And I've called Al out when he's been an ass, you know, and I was like, that's Al being Al.  And is Ant right or wrong?  Makes a good point there.  Is he right?  I don't think the first point of conversation with me doesn't have to be about someone speaking entirely for themselves. 
[03:30:30]  But Ant made a good point.  You would agree with that, right?  I don't know if I agree with that.  Do you think he has some channel to all black people that he's going to go back and let them all know that Al Sharpton's a jerk that day or something?  No, it's just I think Earl has a little more racism in him than he likes to admit.  I think it's camouflaged as pride, but it is a separatist, kind of a racist, kind of a bias thing going on, 
[03:31:00]  which, you know, I think that's natural in all people to be kind of proud of where they came from and their heritage.  But for some reason, white people aren't allowed to do that.  And if I say certain things based on fact...  Your heritage is a white person.  You're Italian.  No, Italian.  But, you know, it's...  But the thing is, it's like...  I don't know.  And black people are African. 
[03:31:30]  Somewhat.  Some aren't.  Some are from the islands and stuff.  But it's like, so why is it this black thing?  It's like the same thing with me.  I'm Italian, but I can't celebrate, you know, being European.  But black people can celebrate being black.  Even though it's like, all right, you're not black.  You're, you know, ancestors from Zimbabwe or Kenya. 
[03:32:00]  I could not tell you where my people are from.  You can trace your roots back.  You would agree you're a racist, though.  I don't think I'm a racist at all.  I don't care where, who you are, where you come from.  It doesn't matter to me.  I'll meet you as a person.  I still...  That's exactly what I said.  So how am I a racist when I'm judging people based on what they do and not their color?  I mean, when Obama first declared his presidency, there were things that, you know... 
[03:32:30]  You said some things.  There were things that were said.  It was just sort of like...  That I think he's going to pay a little more attention to his constituency and to the people  that support him.  98% blacks support Obama and that he's not going to pay a little more attention to that  and perhaps be a little biased as far as which way he leans when giving people aid and support  and money.  Why can't I say that without being racist? 
[03:33:00]  I mean, I don't think he's...  I don't think he's done that at all.  He's shown that in the past.  I mean, the support...  That black support wasn't automatic.  You know, it took him a long time to build that support.  When his candidacy started...  Long time.  Long time.  When you get 98% of black people voting for a black guy, they're voting for him because  he's a black guy.  They don't have to look at his credentials and what he's done.  His credentials are terrible.  He hasn't spent enough time in politics to even be president.  But 98% of black people think he's qualified. 
[03:33:30]  Why?  Because he's black.  Do you honestly think...  I disagree with the black part.  I mean, I think everyone's like...  I want to ask you a lot.  The whole issue of qualifications is, to me, constitutionally, I think it's only what?  You only have to be 36 and an American citizen.  That's it.  That's qualifications.  Oh, well, then you could be president.  Any one of us...  You'd be a lousy-ass president.  I mean, can run for presidency.  I always take a piss when...  Running and being good at your job is a different thing. 
[03:34:00]  I think that when you bring up this whole point of qualifications, the guy was and is  in the Senate.  The guy's held office before.  Yeah, but what?  The community activist crap?  He's a state senator.  He became a...  He is a United States senator.  Mm-hmm.  What do you like about him?  I like the straight...  I mean, I hate to use this term straight talk, but he's...  He's...  He...  It's common sense to me.  It's like, you know what?  Let's tax people who can afford to be taxed more. 
[03:34:30]  I am being taxed.  A lot.  A shitload.  So why should I be taxed more so that money can be given to people that are underprivileged?  Which is exactly what he's talking about.  This is all...  Whatever he's saying, the middle class, is all bullshit.  My tax money is going to go to pay for people that are considered underprivileged, not being  given the help that they need by the government.  Again, turning this into a socialist government. 
[03:35:00]  But first of all, everyone's with the whole tax thing.  We're getting taxed more all the time.  I mean, food has gone up.  Heat has gone up.  Gas has gone up.  That's a tax.  Here in New York City, mass transit...  Where you think I live in the dark?  I pay it.  The fares have gone up, what, twice in like four years?  That's a tax.  Everyone's like, taxes are going up.  Guess what?  Your taxes are already going up.  People who can't afford more.  You're not going to lose...  You're not going to miss this money if you're making, I think it's what, over $250,000? 
[03:35:30]  You are crazy then to think that people aren't going to miss it.  You think people living in Manhattan making $250,000 are rich and should be taxed more  and that money should go to help people out, to raise them up, as Obama has said in the past?  What business is it of his to redistribute people's money that they earned in this country  achieving what is known as the American dream, which is based on, with luck and some skill  and whatever else happens, if you make it, you've made it. 
[03:36:00]  And it's yours.  It's yours to keep.  It's not his job to then take it and decide that somebody else should have it.  I'm not talking about programs.  I'm not talking about highways.  I'm not talking about government facilities, things like that, that we need to pay taxes  for to build and maintain.  I'm talking about what he is saying.  Redistributing wealth from what he considers the wealthy to the fucking poor.  That isn't what this country was based on.  Some people are going to be fucked in the country. 
[03:36:30]  That's what America is.  America is people that made it and people that are fucked and people in the middle that  are trying to get to the made it point.  There's no guarantee in any paper that this country is based on that says you're guaranteed  success, you're guaranteed prosperity, happiness, or fucking money.  And this is what this motherfucker wants to do.  And no one is saying that.  But for those who want to take it, he's saying that.  For those who want that shot and need help getting there, you don't think they should 
[03:37:00]  get that shot?  No.  What the fuck did I get?  Dude, I fucking lived in my car.  I was poor.  I had no fucking money, no job.  I lived in my fucking car until I said, you know something, Anthony?  Get yourself a fucking job and work your way out of this shit.  And that's what I did.  No one gave me shit.  I wasn't able to go, Obama, please tell that guy in the big house to give me some fucking 
[03:37:30]  money so I could rent a place and get on my feet.  That is what this country is about.  So a bank didn't give you a loan.  A bank didn't.  Fuck no.  I mean, we have institutions in place that if you ask for the help and are willing to pay  that money back, it's there.  If you have good credit, you'll get a fucking loan.  If you fucked your credit up, you won't get a loan.  That's how it works.  Why are the banks all of a sudden supposed to fucking dole out?  Look what happened when the banks gave money to fucking people that couldn't pay it back. 
[03:38:00]  They got shit on it.  The banks got fucked.  Well, first of all, the banks got greedy because they saw the interest rates.  They said, you know what?  We can bleed these people off the interest rates.  They started giving loans to people that weren't qualified, which is bad on two sides.  The bank was stupid for doing it, and the motherfuckers that were taking the loans were stupid  for not realizing they couldn't pay it back.  And they foreclosed, and now they're crying.  And now Obama wants to fucking, you know, pay for their foreclosed houses.  Fuck that. 
[03:38:30]  This is like watching the World Series.  Earl, you're the raised, not the devil raised anymore, and then it's the Phillies.  How much of a contest here?  My God.  I just can't take this fucking guy as being president, and it has nothing to do with his  skin color.  If he was a white guy with the same fucking platform, I wouldn't even go near voting for  him.  Wouldn't go near voting for him.  But you don't think the race part is also a factor into it all?  That's why I'm called a racist, Earl.  Thank you.  That's why I'm called a racist. 
[03:39:00]  Because every time I say this about Obama, people say it's because he's black, or half  black, whatever the fuck you want to say.  But the truth of the matter is, it's completely because he's a socialist, he's a fucking way  liberal, he wants to abolish the Second Amendment as far as people's right to bear arms, which  I'm a huge advocate of, of the Second Amendment, not of getting rid of it.  And he wants this redistribution of wealth, which is against everything this country and 
[03:39:30]  capitalism has been based on.  So this isn't any different from what Reagan was saying with the trickle-down thing.  Different trickle-down economics was giving tax cuts to corporations and people that had  money because they employ the people below them, which, and the money trickles down.  It employs people, and it didn't come out of my fucking pocket.  This is taxing individuals taking their money and giving it to other individuals that aren't 
[03:40:00]  as prosperous as the people he took the money from.  That is Marxist socialism.  The way I read it and the way I saw it was just more, it wasn't as cut and dry as you're  describing it.  The way I read it was...  Because if he cut and dry, if he put it as cut and dry like that, people would see it  for what it is.  I mean, I don't feel like, what, giving tax breaks to 95% of the people who need it is  a problem.  You know 35% of the country don't pay fucking taxes? 
[03:40:30]  They get refunds?  Every penny that they put into their taxes for working, they get back in a refund.  So take 35% of the whole fucking country and throw that revenue away.  You're not even getting that.  So when 95% of the people are getting tax cuts, does that include the 35% that aren't  paying taxes?  Are they going to get more money back?  I already pay a fuckload of taxes.  My tax burden is, I'm in that percentage that pays for something like 85% of the country's 
[03:41:00]  revenue is from people like me.  And believe me, I didn't inherit this fucking money.  I earned what I have.  I fucking earned it.  And I don't want some motherfucker saying that I now have to hand it out as charity to  people.  I do my own charity.  I give money to people that I know that are in need.  I give money to certain charities that I want to give to.  I don't want the government telling me who I should pay. 
[03:41:30]  You buy a wheelchair every once in a while.  Every so often if some old crippled little bitch gets a wheelchair stolen, I'll cut a  check.  You know what I have?  I have a charity I want to start.  It's serious.  Gangs.  Gangs.  Gangs are a big problem in this country.  And you notice a lot of innocent people get shot.  A little girl just got shot in the arm.  You hear it all the time.  And when gang violence breaks out, it's always innocent people, bystanders that are getting 
[03:42:00]  shot.  I want to start a charity to give laser sights to gangs.  Nice.  So that way they can put it on their guns and they know who they're shooting.  Like that way, if they shoot, then they're just shooting each other.  You can't miss with those things.  It's a brief.  The dot is on your target.  They're dead.  If the dot's on a kid, you know not to pull the trigger.  It's simple.  So it's laser sights for gangs is my latest venture I want to get into.  You want clean killing. 
[03:42:30]  I want clean killing.  Yes, why not?  I want people that decide they're shooting each other to make sure they hit each other.  Those Asian gangs are the worst shots.  Oh, yes.  They'll take out a whole restaurant and not get the guy to know that.  I don't care what race they are.  Laser sights for any gang.  Latin, black, Asian gangs, white, whatever it is.  Lasers.  I want to thank Alan Combs for coming by.  That was terrific, Earl.  Just like when I watch TV.  Amazing.  Alan Combs hangs right in there. 
[03:43:00]  I want to thank Garfunkel for stopping by today.  Oh, Jesus.  Alan Combs.  Alan Combs.  That guy with the bad skin on TV.  Yeah, Alan Combs.  Alan Combs.  The one that Hannity's shadow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Garfunkel.  All right.  Well, Earl.  Art Garfunkel in today.  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  Hanging out with Simon.  Great.  How many days until everything is hunky-dory for you and your people?  Eight days.  Eight days.  And then everything changes, right? 
[03:43:30]  This big change that he says.  After the inauguration, which, of course, they're calling it something different on some of the  websites I've been to.  Oh, yeah.  You take inauguration.  You switch it around a little.  And it gets funny.  So let me get...  I know what you're thinking.  Let me get this straight.  So a black guy gets in four years out of, what, 230-something?  And people are upset about it.  Real.  Look at...  We've been cool for, like, 200 years.  We're asking for four years.  Maybe eight.  Dude, look what we've done as a country. 
[03:44:00]  You really have...  With older white guys in charge, look what we've done.  The technology, in the short span of the life of this country, has gone from muskets to  achieve our independence to landing on the moon.  How does that have to do with the president, though?  I mean, Thomas Edison invented half the shit you're talking about.  I'm just talking about that guy being in charge.  We haven't been taken over as a nation.  Right.  We, you know, we dropped the war or two.  I understand that.  But we've kept this nation, you know, what it was supposed to be for the most part. 
[03:44:30]  White?  Well, not so much white.  But I just want to see what happens.  If your guy wins, I just want to see what happens.  If there's this big change...  So even if there's, like, a shift in, let's say, he puts in policies or programs that aid  more blacks and minorities as a whole, which, by the way, now slowly become the majority 
[03:45:00]  of this country.  That's a bad thing.  Holy me, I know that.  Yeah, if it's coming out of my check, if it's coming off of my back, what I earned...  I mean, and then you're saying, like, my back.  What if it's coming out of everybody's back?  What if everyone is sacrificing equally?  What if everyone's not?  The people that are getting the free ride are not sacrificing.  They're getting the free ride.  This is what Obama's saying.  He's not saying everyone pays.  He's not saying this is a struggle for this country and the economy.  Everyone's going to have to make sacrifices and go back. 
[03:45:30]  It's, let's get the most votes by saying, I'm helping the middle class, which he means the  lower class, by taxing these evil, and he portrays everybody as the evil rich people,  because everybody like that is white, and they're curling their mustaches.  Some woman is tied to train tracks.  Meanwhile, he's villainizing this small minority of people that are paying and taking care of  this country.  And putting the burden on them to take care of and lift up, oh, how uplifting, and lift 
[03:46:00]  up these fucking people that aren't cutting it.  Well, he's villainizing people who, instead of paying their fair share of putting their  money in tax shelters, he's villainizing corporations that have, you know, that are making billions  of dollars, making tons of money, but at the same time, oh, we gotta make sacrifices.  And cutting, not like a hundred, two hundred, thousands of jobs. 
[03:46:30]  I mean, we're talking corporations that are making significant amounts of money, yet they're  cutting jobs because, why?  They're greedy.  They want to make more money.  So tax them more, and you think they're going to go, well, we're just going to get along  with less money?  Or do you think they're going to go, now we fire more people?  No, how about rewarding companies that actually keep jobs in this country?  Which, again, corporations are doing, outsourcing these jobs to countries that are, you know,  so they can pay the workers a dollar a day. 
[03:47:00]  Great idea.  And that's what he's saying, though.  I got, how is he saying that?  Who's going to be rewarded?  He's like, well, let's give companies incentives for keeping jobs here.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, what's wrong with that?  I mean, that's the people he's talking, that's the, quote, rich people he's talking about.  Rich people who are trying to just not only make more, but make more.  My company doesn't outsource, and I'm going to get screwed.  Where's my fucking incentive?  Where's my break because I'm keeping jobs in this country? 
[03:47:30]  I'm not outsourcing.  And Danny looks foreign.  And, again, the people he's really talking about, he's really talking about people who  just have, it transcends wealth.  It's just ridiculous amounts of wealth.  The thing is, it caps at $250,000.  That's the low end of it.  You're only talking, everyone always talks about the low end.  For a company, for a privately owned company, $250,000 is not that much.  That's a mom-and-pop operation.  When you're talking gross income, taxable income, or even after, you know, deductions 
[03:48:00]  or something, $250,000 is not that much for a company.  And a lot of companies are going to suffer and have to fire people because of his stupid  socialist tax program.  I can't, I cannot stomach the thought of him being president.  It just, it really makes me sick.  I mean, I think we will not be any worse than we have been the last eight years.  Well, that's good, because the last eight years has been horrific. 
[03:48:30]  The president we have in there now, Bush, has been a do-nothing shithead for eight years.  If he wasn't, if he had one good quality, this wouldn't even be a question a Republican  would be in there.  But he fucked up so bad that he's handing this over to the Democrats.  I don't know.  It's just, Earl.  Earl, you did pretty good this time.  We'll have to agree to disagree.  We'll have to agree to disagree.  Good luck to your candidate, and we'll see what happens. 
[03:49:00]  It's going to be interesting.  You and other black people are so excited about this.  This is going to be like one of those OJ acquitted moments, isn't it?  Morning after election.  Yeah.  A bunch of people in the streets just jumping around, cheering like maniacs.  Well, the cool thing about this whole thing is that he...  For an election like it's a fucking...  Like it was the NBA.  Like it was when the Bulls won.  It's going to be a pandemonium in the streets, right?  Just get the word out.  I don't want my car overturned and burned.  Please.  No.  Because finally, finally, you guys have reached the pinnacle of power in the country, and 
[03:49:30]  then there'll be no more excuses, I guess.  If a black man can become president in this country, then there is truly no more...  There's not enough racism in this country to hurt you anymore.  Well, it's just like...  I don't know if it's racism.  I don't know if it's sexism.  I mean, it's just...  It is a turning point.  If he gets elected, do you agree that there's not enough racism left in the country to interfere  with black people being successful if they apply themselves? 
[03:50:00]  Just like anyone else.  I mean, black people always apply themselves.  I mean, the problem has always been that when...  The Obama supporters, by the way, back there, they're driving to the studio to...  Oh, they want to kill me.  They not even want to kill you.  Do they want to argue the point better than Earl is arguing it?  Earl is Obama's biggest fan.  He'll put their line to it.  For the love of God, Earl, say something.  I mean, Obama, everyone's like, Obama trying to, like, cakewalk. 
[03:50:30]  This guy worked his ass off.  Exactly.  The guy went to Harvard.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  Listen...  And there are plenty of black people doing the same thing.  Is there enough racism left in this country to interfere with a black person that wants to succeed  in this country?  I mean, look at what's happening around the country with Obama running.  Let me...  And I'll get to that.  See, yes or no question.  Is there...  There's a guy in Ohio right now who's built an Obama effigy.  There is plenty of racism still in this country. 
[03:51:00]  Of course there is.  Is there enough to keep a motivated black man from achieving...  Yeah, absolutely.  How?  Absolutely.  If the man achieves the presidency of the United States, how can you then say there's still  enough racism to interfere with any driven black man who wants to achieve a goal in his  life?  I mean, look at 2008.  We're still having first black this.  First black that.  I mean, 2008.  I mean, 44...  They're almost 45 years after the Civil Rights Act. 
[03:51:30]  44 years after the Voting Rights Act.  We're still...  We're still...  Pinnacle, though.  Pinnacle.  We're still...  President.  Pinnacle of the free world.  It's the tip of the iceberg, yes.  But there's still...  At least on a local level, there's still a long way to go.  How is racism going to stop, um, whatever, any black guy who goes to school, educates  himself, and wants to get into the job market, has a goal, has a future set for himself, a 
[03:52:00]  job he wants, to achieve that, how is racism in this country, in this day and age, going  to stand in his way when Obama is able to achieve the presidency of the United States?  Well, you still have cronyism.  You still have...  I mean, there's still a lot of isms going on.  Cronyism keeps white people.  Nepotism keeps white people from getting work.  It doesn't matter.  Like, that's part of just doing business in this country.  Black people have to understand, it's not always racism.  Sometimes someone's brother-in-law gets the fucking job. 
[03:52:30]  That's just the way it works.  Cronyism.  But I don't think there's enough racism left where it hurts motivated black people.  The guy made president.  He's...  Well, he's just about there.  Yeah.  And...  Yeah, he's...  You were saying that there were all these firsts that haven't been achieved yet, but...  No, still.  I mean, we're still having...  But not all these other achievements are voted in, so you can't say...  I mean, how is racism responsible for stopping somebody from achieving a first if there's not 
[03:53:00]  going to vote, you know, to elect them?  Well, 100,000 people at his rally.  All colors.  Where's the racism?  Where's the racism that's keeping the black man down when this guy is achieving what he  is achieving?  But you would have to agree.  There's been poll after poll where they're saying there's still a significant percentage  of people that are like, I am not voting for him because he is black. 
[03:53:30]  I don't care.  And 98% of black people are voting for him.  So you don't think they're voting for him because he's black?  You don't think they're...  But that was such...  What's the difference?  That was such a slow build.  And when he was running in the primaries...  It was instantaneous.  Every black person was going, holy shit, a black guy.  Let's vote for him.  And during the primaries...  But Teresa O'Neill himself is being honest, more honest than you.  He at least said, I'm voting for him because he's black.  During the primaries, there was, I would say, almost a 50-50 split between...  With blacks, they're like, you know, I'm going to vote for Hillary. 
[03:54:00]  She's been good to blacks.  It was...  That took a long time to build.  And you think it's based on his platform and not the fact that he's black?  98%.  I'll give you a minute.  So based on the same thing...  My parents in the primaries were voting for Hillary.  So if there was a white guy, a white guy with the exact same credentials as Obama, 98% of the blacks would vote for him because he's a wonderful guy that has all these great platforms.  If he was the same package, they would vote for him. 
[03:54:30]  98%.  Stop it, Earl.  I would say...  Earl, stop it.  No, hold on.  That's crazy.  Hold on.  No, if he...  And it's happened before where we've had...  I mean, there was a large black percentage of people who were going to vote for Kennedy.  I mean...  98%.  2% of Republican, what they call Uncle Toms, were the ones that are left out.  Everyone else is voting for him.  And if it was a white guy with the exact credentials, you mean to tell me there wouldn't be a difference?  I mean, the exact same package...  Same exact package with a white face. 
[03:55:00]  I would say that, yeah.  98%.  Okay, you're crazy.  I'm sorry.  I have to dub you insane.  That's a tough one there.  You're lying to yourself.  I'm not lying to myself.  I mean, the exact same package with the political climate that is out there now?  Yes.  I would agree with that.  No way.  Mm-mm-mm.  That's crazy.  No.  I can't see that.  Yeah, let's get Rob Dukes to beat up Earl now that the debate's over.  Rob, it's to you now.  It's a big finale.  You beat up Earl for having a different opinion than Anthony. 
[03:55:30]  No?  Oh, gosh.  All right, Earl.  That was...  You guys in.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Yeah, that was great, Earl.  I wouldn't worry about it.  You guys in.  You're going to have at least four years of being able to just hoot and holler about having  your guy in.  Earl, they're telling us it's going to be a wonderful time.  No, he's still got work.  It's going to be a wonderful time for African-Americans.  They got it knocked.  Make no mistake.  You have ice cube.  Yeah.  Make no mistake.  There is a lot of work to do.  Earl, they're telling us you have to go. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, that's what they tell you on the Rana Fez show.  Right.  So I guess go do it.  They're saying you have to go, so...  Yeah, they're telling us.  Your publicist is saying that.  Yeah.  Go make some phone calls.  What are you making?  Obama phone calls back there?  Vote for Obama.  Get the vote out.  All right, Earl.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Godspeed.  There he goes.  Fight the power, Earl.  Fight the power, Earl.  There you go, Earl.  Fight the power.  Holla.  He's crazy if he thinks 98% of black people would vote for a white guy. 
[03:56:30]  He's in music.  Fight the power.  Fight the power.  Holla.  Fuck the police.  Holla.  Fuck the police.  Holla.  I'm Flavor Flav.  Yeah.  That's all he did, and he got millions.  Kicking ass.  Holla.  A line of the day is brought to you by Webex.com.  Hold meetings.  Make presentations.  Do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out.  Farting very badly.
