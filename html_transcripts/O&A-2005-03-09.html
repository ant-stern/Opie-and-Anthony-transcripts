<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about an upcoming (and later revealed to be a repeat) Brady Bunch reunion special, focusing on the cardboard cutout of Robert Reed and the financial struggles of some cast members like Barry Williams and Susan Olsen.  The hosts shared anecdotes about their personal relationships with Olsen and Williams, noting Olsen's surprising lack of cable TV.  Technical difficulties with their headphones were a recurring comedic element throughout the show.  Listener calls provided further details about the reunion special.  The hosts recounted humorous stories about their studio’s technical mishaps, including destroying a phone system.  They also previewed an upcoming guest list featuring Jim Norton, Steven Pearcy (Ratt), Curtis (a gay black rapper), and teased a previously unreleased track imagining Mike Brady's alleged sexual deviancy.  The show also briefly touched upon a Bernie Goetz incident at the studio (caught on security footage), a Reggie Jackson car accident, and Bill Clinton's recent surgery, while promoting opianthony.com and RateMyWow.com.

The show continued with a crude joke about a recent surgery, followed by speculation about the unlikely friendship between George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.  Frequent guest Jimmy Norton joined, sharing a graphically detailed and humorous story about a bizarre doctor's visit involving stool sample collection.  The hosts then complained about the loud music between segments and Ricky's food ordering mishaps, with Anthony ordering a tuna fish sandwich at 6 a.m.  Norton recounted his nerve-wracking HBO audition experience in Los Angeles, including a humorous misidentification of Louis C.K.’s manager. He successfully landed a role in a dirty sitcom pilot. Opie announced his potential departure from the show, planning a move to a warmer climate and a shift in radio programming.

Dick Vitale called in, initially experiencing technical difficulties, and provided insightful commentary and predictions for the upcoming NCAA men's basketball tournament, discussing teams like North Carolina, Duke, Connecticut, and Gonzaga, using his "Vital Ball Dome Index" (VBDI).  He also mentioned his appearances in *FHM* magazine and commercials, and his fundraising for the Jimmy V Foundation.  Following the interview, the hosts played a vulgar audio clip of "Dick Vitale Goes Ape Shit."  They then discussed upcoming segments with Stephen Pearcy, Curtis, and Tawny Peaks (a porn star who sold her breast implants on eBay), and played audio clips including a "queefing" sound, "Diary of a Dead Dog," and critical excerpts from Kirstie Alley's *Fat Actress*.  The segment also included discussion of Ratt’s “Round and Round” and a lesser-known song, “Way Cool Junior,” along with continued complaints about persistent audio issues and promotional announcements, including Kirstie Alley’s appearance on *Letterman*.

The show included an in-studio interview with Stephen Pearcy (Ratt), focusing on his legal battles with the band over its name and his contributions.  He detailed his alleged founding of the band and creation of the logo,  the ongoing legal issues preventing his book's completion, and promoters misleading fans about his absence.  He also discussed the band's drug use and numerous groupies, claiming a personal "quota" of three women a day.  A phone interview with Tawny Peaks followed, with sexually suggestive and crude banter revolving around her adult film career and the sale of her breast implants on eBay for approximately $16,700.  The conversation included discussions about softcore vs. hardcore pornography, her breast reduction, and her reasons for leaving the industry (financial insecurity after her son’s open-heart surgery and Down syndrome diagnosis).  Kurtis, a “gay black rapper,” was present in the studio but minimally involved in the conversation.  They also discussed a chimp attack news story.

A later phone interview with Tawny Peaks saw Opie making crude remarks about her appearance, while Tony defended her.  In-studio guests Stephen Pearcy (involved in drag racing) and Curtis were featured.  Curtis’s explicit rap about having sex with famous rappers was played on air. Pearcy shared an anecdote about touring with “Aussie” in the 1980s.  A significant portion involved a vulgar and offensive exchange between Opie, Tony, and Curtis, incorporating racial and homophobic slurs and boasts of sexual exploits.  The show concluded with a promotion for Ben Bailey as an upcoming guest.

[00:05:30]  XM-202  XM-202  That old gag.  I think they're doing another reunion.  No way.  Yeah, Eric was just telling me before we hit the air.  Yeah, tonight at 10 o'clock on TV Land.  Stop.  Still Brady after all these years.  And they rebuilt the entire house set.  Of course they did.  So the whole family's going to be there.  And they have a live audience.  The whole family's going to be there? 
[00:06:00]  Are you sure?  They have a cardboard cutout of Mike Brady.  Mike Brady.  On the side of the set.  No way, really?  That's what was in the promo.  What happened?  I just lost complete everything.  Are you serious?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  It's back, but it's crackling.  Are you serious?  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I'm going to... 
[00:06:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't touch it.  Don't touch it.  All right.  Better?  There we go.  No, you know what happened?  It crackled, went completely out for like a few seconds.  And then I tugged on the cord and it came back.  So something's loose in there.  At any moment during the show, my headphones can completely go out.  And you will lose your effing mind.  No, I'm done losing my mind.  Really?  Yeah.  They've beaten me.  I'm a beaten man.  I'm done getting pissed off. 
[00:07:00]  Now, what's great about you getting pissed off, no one expects it from you.  Yeah.  Because I'm just like, you know, Mr. Mellow Guy.  I don't care.  But yesterday I was pissed.  No, I just...  I don't care.  Whatever.  And, you know, I get pissed off so regularly.  People are like, ah.  Opie's just pissed again.  He's just pissed again.  Yeah.  I was reading some of the emails that are forwarded to, like, all the big wigs.  Big wigs.  And, you know, we've had problems with the studio and stuff.  And one of the emails to Kevin is like, Kevin, we all know Opie will never actually be happy,  but... 
[00:07:30]  Oh, really?  I want to be happy.  I got you down.  Yeah, they're like, we all know, we've been listening to him for years, that I don't think  anything can make him happy.  But, with that said, could you please fix their equipment so they can give us good radio every day?  Fix it.  And I'm reading this like, what are you...  What kind of...  What?  I just want to be happy.  I'm happy in general in my life.  I lost my mind yesterday.  And the problem has been conveyed to the proper authorities. 
[00:08:00]  And we'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  Okay, so...  I've been here for a few months.  So this Brady Bunch thing is tonight?  Tonight at 10.  Oh, boy.  You are kidding about the cutout, boy.  They have a cutout of what?  Of Mike Brady?  Of Mike Brady.  And how is it going to be used in this reunion?  That I don't know, but you see a...  It actually is...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  What happened?  What happened?  Your headphones are loud?  Oh, wow.  It's nothing you did. 
[00:08:30]  I don't think.  All right, try again.  It's like Gilbert Godfrey in the Dice movie, all electrocuted.  Because he's grabbing his head.  Did it shock you again?  Do you need the spray?  Oh, I've got mad.  No, no.  It just got really loud, and now it's like...  Now it's low, kind of.  Your...  Oh, his mic?  Eric's mic?  All right, talk again.  Okay.  Yeah, that's fine.  All right.  Weird.  There you go.  The cardboard cutout is actually as thin as Robert Reed was at the end of his life, so 
[00:09:00]  they figured they would just put that in there.  You just see a quick thing during the little TV promo.  There's a cardboard cutout of the young Mike Brady from, like, the first season.  Of course.  Not the AIDS-ravaged Mike Brady couldn't put that...  They should have the cutout laying in a hospital bed with IVs running into him.  With the afro and the...  And that awful mustache he had at the end there.  And a close friend in a robe at bedside.  And what are they going to do with the cutout?  I don't know.  I just saw it really quick in a promo.  You just see the cutout, and then you see all of them lined up on the stairs, taking photos, 
[00:09:30]  smiling and waving at the audience.  Is the mouth cut out of the cutout?  That's got to be creepy.  So they have them all on the stairs like they used to, but it's how they look today.  Yeah.  And then at the bottom of the stairs, they have a young Mike Brady.  No, no, no.  The cutout is put off to the side of the set.  But you see them just in a...  It's like a whole montage thing, quick clips of different shots throughout the whole special.  And you just see in one quick clip, there's a cardboard cutout of Mike Brady right on the side.  You know, I'm a fan of the Brady Bunch.  Watched it for years growing up. 
[00:10:00]  I think the behind-the-scenes stuff is cool.  And the book that Greg Brady put out.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams.  He hates me to call Greg Brady in real life, you idiot.  I know.  He scolded us for that many times.  I call him Johnny Bravo then.  Right.  He, you know, all that stuff.  Very fun and entertaining.  But is there really anything else we need to know about the Brady Bunch that they have to get together again to show how they're deteriorating?  Is that really necessary? 
[00:10:30]  You know, I have an image of Marsha Brady.  I want it to remain like that in my head.  I don't want to constantly see her year after year after year just getting older.  Older and older and older and older.  That's it.  We interviewed her like ten years ago and she was still looking really, really hot.  Yeah, she looked really good.  But now, you know, oh, I'm a stay-at-home mom.  Right, right.  Shut up.  You're Marsha.  Put on that little cheerleader outfit.  Put on the little bikini you wore in Hawaii.  Well, we say it a lot. 
[00:11:00]  You know, time is a bitch.  So why would you put yourself in that situation?  For money, Opie.  That's what they do it for.  Well, probably, I'm sure that, you know, the kids, even though they're all in their 50s, I imagine at this point, you know, they didn't get any of those residuals.  No, no, they didn't.  Not like today's sitcoms.  Any sitcom that's on TV now, these guys will make money the rest of their lives.  Oh, hell yeah.  But back in the day, like when the Brady Bunch was doing their thing, you know, they got paid a certain amount, and that was it.  So now they've got to keep showing up. 
[00:11:30]  Because I know Barry pretty well.  You know, he does okay.  Yeah.  But he doesn't have money like you think he should, you know, being on probably the most popular sitcom of all time, if you really break it down.  He should have huge amounts of money.  There should be royalties, because that's playing all around the world.  At any given moment, that show is playing somewhere.  And then what's his name?  Peter Brady.  I forget his, Christopher Knight, I guess.  Yeah.  Who was on that Surreal Life.  Uh-huh.  And now he's dating that young, the young one from the show. 
[00:12:00]  Get out of here.  He's like 47, and she's 22 or something like that, and they're in love.  Unless they've broken up since she claimed she was in love with Peter Brady.  He was saying right on that show that, yeah, he made no money as well.  None.  Man.  So I'm wondering if these guys are getting together and, you know, getting a nice paycheck to do this.  Yeah, they grab them all and put them together every so often, every few years, and they make money.  Because you've got to figure, you know, at least Peter Brady has done stuff, and Greg has done stuff.  What about the other ones that have done nothing that you haven't seen? 
[00:12:30]  What has Jan done?  Except, like, the last special they had where they dragged them all together, she was talking about her painting.  Oh, and I'm painting now.  Oh.  When you have an actress that is now, all you see is her on these reunion shows talking about her painting,  and Marcia is saying, oh, yes, I bought some of her paintings.  Of course you have.  You're the only one that would.  That's, like, one of those things where, please, just fade away.  Well, speaking of which, you know, it's a known fact that I became friends with Barry through our radio show. 
[00:13:00]  Barry Williams.  Good old Barry Williams.  And every time he would come into New York, you know, he'd call me or I'd call him.  We'd get together for a drink or dinner or what have you.  And one time...  Would he get Dad's station wagon or the convertible to take you out of it?  And he came to New York once to do that whole promotion for M&M's.  I think it was about two summers ago.  It was a whole big thing they did, and they used him and Cindy Williams.  Not Cindy Williams.  Jesus.  Cindy Brady.  Cindy Brady.  I forget her real name and real life. 
[00:13:30]  Cindy Brady.  I know.  Susan Olsen.  Susan Olsen.  Right.  Susan Olsen.  Susan Olsen.  So they're talking to, like, TV morning shows around the country on a satellite hookup.  Yeah.  And, you know, Barry invites me to go and check it out.  So I got to hang and talk to them a little bit.  And it turns out Susan Olsen, a.k.a. Cindy Brady, she doesn't even have cable.  And she has, like, a young daughter or something?  No cable.  That has never seen the Brady Bunch.  Wherever she lives, she doesn't have cable TV.  Why?  Because she doesn't want to see it? 
[00:14:00]  I have no idea what that was about.  That would be kind of interesting if that's the reason.  She just doesn't want to inadvertently pass by her little lisping face on television or have her kids see it.  Yeah, but you would assume, you know, I don't know, you would assume if you were on the Brady Bunch you'd be taking a peek all the time and make sure you have cable or something.  You kind of have no choice.  I know if I'm just rallying around the channels, that damn show pops up everywhere.  And if you're one of them, because picture being your age now, but you're just known as a little kid. 
[00:14:30]  And you go around the channels and there's, like, your home movies on television from when you were a kid all the time.  That would get pretty sickening.  I know that would really get annoying after a while.  What I hate about the Brady Bunch reunion specials that they do, it's not fun anymore.  It's not funny.  No, no.  All of a sudden, they turn it into, like, a drama.  Like, what is going to be the big thing tonight?  I'm sure there'll be some kind of tragedy.  Is it just a show where they're getting together and, what, are they playing clips? 
[00:15:00]  Or is it there going to be a new plot line?  The promo doesn't really tell you much.  It just says, you know, tonight on TV land.  It's like a very, you know, still Brady after all these years.  The original cast gets back together.  Okay, it's going to be one of those clip shows.  Probably, yeah.  Because when they were doing the, they were still doing original plots and storylines,  they decided to make a Brady Bunch, what they call the dramedy.  Right.  It's the drama comedy.  Right.  And for some reason, there was absolutely no comedy in these things whatsoever. 
[00:15:30]  It was, what was it, Robert Reed was running for some office and one of the kids.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby's in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  Yeah, driving a race car and he shows up in a wheelchair.  It's like, someone was trying to assassinate Mr. Brady or something.  I don't know what the hell was going on.  It was awful.  He got trapped in a building on the Christmas episode.  That was it on the Christmas episode.  One of his buildings collapsed.  And he went in there to rescue some of the workers, but he got trapped, but everyone else 
[00:16:00]  got out.  Like, what the hell?  What happened to Tiger stealing the kitty carry-all?  And why is his building collapsing?  Yeah, great job there, Mike.  You're a hell of an architect.  Maybe he wasn't feeling good that day.  Maybe it was a bad day.  He had the sniffles that day and kind of designed an I-beam not to carry the load like it was  supposed to.  Too funny.  Remember at the end of that where Cindy tells Mom, remember when you sang during Christmas  when you lost your voice, and they're all just singing?  And then Robert Reed triumphantly comes through the building. 
[00:16:30]  He got out okay right before the building collapsed.  What a moment.  Yeah, they flash back to an early episode, a Christmas episode of the Brady Bunch where  Mrs. Brady is singing.  His buildings are collapsing.  His T-cell count is collapsing.  All at the same time.  But I guess they're doing one of those clip shows.  What happened was Carol Burnett did the clip show.  Oh, yeah.  Bringing back the old cast.  They sit around on a stage and they show clips and go, remember when?  Happy Days just did it. 
[00:17:00]  Well, I was going to say it started with the Carol Burnett show.  That got such huge ratings.  Everyone else, their ears perked up and went, whoa, hey, there's something here.  So, yeah, then they did the Happy Days one.  They did another one.  I forgot which show.  And now that's what they're going to do.  They're going to be just hanging out, talking about the old days and showing clips.  And then they'll have a moment where they all remember.  Remembering Mike Brady.  Remembering Robert Reed.  Robert Reed.  It's just going to be douche chills. 
[00:17:30]  Get some audio of that for tomorrow's show.  Show some of the best acting that Robert Reed ever did.  Laying in bed and making believe he was actually a heterosexual man.  Kissing Florence Henderson.  Hey, he had everyone beat.  Man, when he rolled over and went, good night, honey, and kisses Florence Henderson, you're  like, oh, there he is, you know.  He's the husband.  She's the wife.  He looked like a man's man.  Right.  The type of guy you want to be when you grow up.  There you go.  When you're just a skinny little kid on Long Island looking, you know, how a husband should 
[00:18:00]  be.  Right.  You never pictured at home he was actually biting the pillow going, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, no, but on that TV show, it looked like he took care of business.  Greg.  Greg.  Come on down here.  Yes, you could use the car for your road test.  You know, he was the dad.  Yeah.  All right, honey.  Good night. 
[00:18:30]  Good.  Roll over and go to sleep.  She's reading the book.  In his mind, he's like.  He's got a butt plug shoved up his ass during the scene.  He seems like dad.  He gives the kiss and then rolls over and in his mind, he's like, oh, God, thank God.  Another night I skated.  She didn't touch me.  Thank God.  All right.  It's time for the kiss scene.  All right.  Good night, sweetie.  Oh, I hope she didn't smell asshole on my lips.  Oh, God.  Jeez. 
[00:19:00]  I hope she didn't smell Ron's ass on my mustache.  Someone is saying that tonight's show is a repeat.  It is.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Real good.  Basically, it was a repeat of the show that they did a couple months ago.  Jenny McCarthy's hosting it.  And it's not even a clip show.  It was just like rehashing, like, mom going out with Greg and all that kind of stuff and 
[00:19:30]  who's kissing who and ugh.  Really?  Fuck it out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Whatever.  I was just saying, turn the phones down a little bit.  Yeah.  Everything's blasting today.  Isn't everything so hot today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, it's all just bubbling, waiting to explode.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Isn't it?  Like, I'm hearing everything.  When I'm talking into this mic, it's like, uh-oh.  I'm here to just peeking.  At this point, it's just a joke.  You know, it's just, there's no reason to get mad anymore. 
[00:20:00]  It just is a complete and utter joke.  This studio is a backwoods still, waiting to just blow up in our face.  We did start this radio show about five months ago, right?  Five, six months.  It's just a joke at this point.  Yeah.  When we first moved back to New York and started at WNEW, I think everything worked from day one.  It was old stuff in there.  Occasionally, a cart machine would break, and they'd fix it. 
[00:20:30]  And I had to break the antique phone to get my point across that we needed a real phone system for a talk show.  Yeah.  Remember?  Yeah.  Back in the day, it was like a big, huge wooden box that was used just to take two for Tuesday  requests, and, you know, to conference callers and stuff, you had to go through a whole checklist  of pushing this button, turn this down.  Oh, the phone system wasn't made up.  It was made for, that phone system actually had taken calls from contest winners for Zeppelin tickets 
[00:21:00]  when they were still touring.  Yeah.  That was like the last call that was made on that phone before us.  And they didn't really understand because we were the first talk show that went to this  legendary radio station, WNEW, and...  Why do we need so many phone lines?  Right.  Day after day, we're telling them.  You know, we're trying to do this talk show thing, and I think we had two lines or something.  Karen Miller's just taking who requests.  Finally.  Why do you need a phone system?  Unfortunately, this was when Ant and I were doing radio in New York, and quite frankly, 
[00:21:30]  no one cared.  There were no websites.  There were no message boards.  There weren't people, like, recording the show every day and trading bits all over the world.  So I don't think there's any audio that exists, but one day I just said, oh, all right, well,  I'll get my point across.  Completely destroyed the phone system.  And the next day, guess what was there waiting for us?  A brand new phone system that Pete Johnson put in.  We had balls back then because we didn't even have ratings.  And to make a move like that, to completely destroy a piece of equipment, you know, most 
[00:22:00]  jocks would just get fired for that.  I know.  They would come in as you're doing it and just, you know, just take you off the air.  There's something to be said for being at a very desperate radio station.  Yeah, I guess.  They were as desperate as we were.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, yeah, well, it worked out.  We have a lot of, you know, up-and-coming guys that ask us for advice, and the one thing  I always say is know when to know when you can take your shot.  Take your shots.  It's either when you have ratings or when the station has no choice but to keep you. 
[00:22:30]  And then you could really be an asshole.  Like, I was just, I was the good jock just playing the songs and reading the line of cards  for, you know, a few years there.  Yeah.  And then I got to Buffalo and I was doing overnights, and all of a sudden I realized  the PD was asleep.  He had to sleep sometime, and he wasn't taping my show, so that's when I started, you know,  dare I say getting, you know, crazier.  Getting wacky.  It's nothing compared to what we do today, but I knew then it was time to take some chances 
[00:23:00]  because no one was listening to me.  So, all right, why don't we take a quick break, Anthony?  We're just getting warmed up.  We got lots to do today.  Has Jim landed?  Oh, yeah.  See, he's wrong.  Jim is ahead of schedule.  Be here by 7 a.m.  Wow.  Jim Norton has just landed from L.A., so he'll have some real good stories starting around  7 o'clock.  Where are you coming?  To Newark?  Came into Newark.  He's probably tired and miserable.  He did the red-eye flight.  Have you ever done the red-eye flight from L.A.?  It is the worst.  Years ago, I know.  It is.  It really stinks. 
[00:23:30]  Because you just want to sleep and you can't because they're, you know.  And they tack those hours on, so it's like really late for you, you know.  Right.  You sit there, you try to get some sleep.  You could leave at like 8 o'clock at night and you're not here until the wee hours of  the morning.  Right.  And just when you're getting good sleep, you know, then there's announcements and then  some idiot has to get up and go to the bathroom and, yeah.  It is just the worst because all you want to do is sleep and you can't.  What were you going to say, Ben?  I don't know.  He sounds good.  He should be here soon.  Cool.  All right.  He's ahead of schedule.  All right.  We got that. 
[00:24:00]  We got, oh, wow.  Steven Pierce, he's coming in today?  Yeah, he's great.  He's got some great stories.  He is?  Yeah.  From Rat?  Yeah.  From Rat.  Coming in?  Yes.  Lead singer of Rat.  Maybe he can help us with the tribute band thing that we're starting on.  I wonder if he's ever seen any Rat tributes.  Probably.  There are some.  I'll pop it up on a website and see if I can find any.  He'd probably get a good laugh.  And then Curtis, the gay black rapper.  He's the one that Jim had talked about from Caroline's.  He's not related to Gangsta fans.  No, he's a totally different guy.  Ooh.  Oh, wow.  Imagine them hooking up. 
[00:24:30]  There must be a movement in the rap community.  This is the new movement.  They're going to be like drive-by butt-fucking in front of the radio station.  Yeah, mother...  Buck, buck.  Remember, Jim was saying like Curtis was the pioneer.  Curtis was talking about this years ago.  Yeah.  And now Gangsta Fag, you know, we gave Gangsta Fags.  Just ripping them off?  Yeah.  You know...  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  So people at Caroline's heard that we were playing Gangsta Fag, so...  I was the first one to get anally raped, Robin.  I was doing ass sex before anybody. 
[00:25:00]  Ripping me off.  Yeah, I don't know if you want to be known as the pioneer of gay rap.  Gay rap.  Gay black rap.  Yeah.  Ooh, sexy.  You know, I mean, gay is barely accepted in the white community.  I'm imagining gay in the black community is like, has to be even ten times worse.  What do they call that, though?  On the down low.  Oh, yeah?  On the down low.  It's guys that walk around like they're straight.  You know, black guys walk around like they're straight.  Yeah.  But they're really, on the down low, they're really gay. 
[00:25:30]  And they go and have their gayness, but then they go back to their chicks.  And that's why a lot of, you know, the chicks are getting the AIDS and stuff.  Because they don't know if their guys are gay.  You know what's happening over there.  You know a little bit about everything.  Hey, it wasn't me that said it.  I just read it somewhere.  I read it.  Don't be buck buck gunfire outside these studios.  All right, speaking of gay and black and the Brady Bunch, I don't know.  Wow, how do you tie that all together?  Well, it's one of my favorites, actually, the Mike Brady thing that's on the CD that was never released 
[00:26:00]  because the stupid lawyers nixed our follow-up to Demented World.  Yes.  But it's available all over the Internet these days.  It was a CD that we were going to call Cringe, and here's a little track called Mike Brady.  Mike Brady designed the Brady House.  Right.  And he didn't design any backs on the stairs leading up to the kids' room.  And there was a place where there was bushes under the stairs for someone to hide. 
[00:26:30]  So you thought Mr. Brady was under the stairs checking out his daughters and his sons.  I knew he was.  He designed the house.  Marsha!  Marsha Davy Jones is here for you!  Marsha!  Oh, yeah.  Come on down those stairs.  You hot bitch!  Look at you.  Yeah.  Mike!  What?  Mike!  What do you want?  Can you call Cindy down? 
[00:27:00]  Cindy?  I need Cindy.  Tiger ate the mail again.  Oh, Cindy.  Cindy, come down.  But could you wear that little Shirley Temple outfit you wore with the dress?  Don't be scared.  I'll be right under the stairs.  I'm just under the stairs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lisp for me.  You're the dirtiest Brady of them all.  Thief, thief, thief, thief, bite a thief.  You're a dirty girl, aren't you?  He's healthy.  Mike!  Mike!  You faghead! 
[00:27:30]  What?  Why are my panties stretched out, Mike?  Why are you asking me?  Alice's fat ass is probably in them.  That's probably it, Mike!  Oh, well, I need Jan.  Jan has to come down.  My God, I have to reprimand her for not wearing her glasses.  She could have killed herself.  Oh.  Yeah, strut down those stairs.  You little Brady.  Yeah, you're a filthy Brady girl.  Oh, stop on the stairs.  Stop right there. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Dad, can I turn your office into a room for me?  Greg?  Yeah, Dad?  Now, Greg, we're going to have a talk about this because an office has a lot of responsibility.  I want you to come down here and I'll meet you in the office.  Okay.  Come on.  Oh.  Look at that Johnny Bravo ass in those pants.  Dad, can I call you, Mike?  Yeah, call me whatever you want. 
[00:28:30]  Okay.  I'm going to take you to the Grand Canyon.  Really, Dad?  Yeah.  But I want to sing.  Sing into the microphone, son.  All right.  That's not a microphone.  It's winking at me.  Dad, you're Jewish.  Bobby!  Bobby!  Yeah, Dad?  Come on down here.  We're going to play on the trampoline.  I wish I was taller.  Yeah.  I'm going to hang on the monkey boys to get taller.  You jump up and down on that trampoline. 
[00:29:00]  I'm looking right up your shorts leg.  Yeah.  Boy, that looks like a plucked chicken, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Not a hair on there.  Wow.  You forgot Peter.  Peter!  Peter!  We're all out of pork chops and applesauce.  Oh.  That's okay, Peter.  Come on down.  All right.  Come on down and I'll feed you a sausage. 
[00:29:30]  That's what you want, sausage.  Oh, walk down those stairs.  Look at you.  Wow.  You get an afro just like Dad's.  I bet you have one of those Brady afros in your pants, too, don't you?  Yeah.  It's time to change, isn't it?  Dad!  Dad!  Jan's yelling at me because he's using my hairbrush!  Shut up and get on the bunk bed.  Oh.  Here comes Greg again. 
[00:30:00]  Those are groovy glasses, Greg.  You know, you were caught smoking, but no one has to know.  I won't tell Mom if you just help out old Dad.  It wasn't my jacket, Dad.  It wasn't my jacket.  I don't care.  Why are you putting the jacket over my head?  Now we're going to smoke a cigar.  Come here, Greg.  This is a fine cigar.  I call this the pink-tip white owl.  You're going to like the draw on this one.  Hi, Mr. Brady.  Is Alice home?  Hey, Sam.  To come over here and show me some meat. 
[00:30:30]  All right, as long as Alice isn't home.  Okay.  Very good.  That was...  Can we leave on an up note?  I doubt it.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:31:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  In case you didn't know.  The Opie and Anthony, XM202.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:31:30]  It's, I don't know, it's 16 degrees in New York City.  I opened my big fat mouth yesterday.  Yeah.  I saw Anthony out in the middle of the darkness coming to work.  The darkness.  Every once in a while we'll meet.  Yeah, the front door.  That's like one of those real coincidences.  No, it's not even the front door.  I got you down the sidewalk a little bit.  Oh.  And one time I scared the crap out of Anthony because Anthony's always on edge when he's  walking to work. 
[00:32:00]  Very on edge.  So now, like, I saw you yesterday and you're ahead of me and I'm like, Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Just so it doesn't scare you because at one point I came up behind you.  Hey, dude.  And you jumped at me.  Blah.  I know.  And Anthony rarely yells at me or raises his voice, but he's like, dude, you motherfucker.  You fucking scared the shit out of me.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, exactly.  Audio of Anthony.  Right. 
[00:32:30]  That's me.  Oh, my.  And, you know, you didn't have your hood on.  You weren't all bundled up yesterday.  No.  And I'm like, man, look at this, Anthony.  Look at this.  Spring is in the air.  I said it yesterday.  I was walking in with a little fleece.  Nothing.  Yeah, we didn't need anything.  Light gloves, barely, you know.  And I'm talking about we finally made it through this stupid winter.  Because for New York, it's been an awful winter.  It really has.  It hasn't been really, really cold, but it's just been kind of that just same temperature 
[00:33:00]  day in and day out with no real breaks.  I mean, in New York, we get breaks.  We get some, you know, warm-ups.  And we got a couple, but nothing like we usually do.  And I'm just like, oh, we're finally here.  Look, look, look how we're walking to work.  It's going to happen any day now.  And then it goes, uh, it's going to, like, change starting now.  Yeah, middle of the day.  Maybe I should, you know, watch the weather on TV.  Yeah, occasionally watch the weather.  I listened to the news on the way in, so I knew it was coming. 
[00:33:30]  And then I got home yesterday, blizzard.  Yeah.  Goddamn blizzard outside.  I just went to bed.  I hibernated yesterday.  And then this morning, the commute in, just ice everywhere.  The Long Island Expressway, which is usually, even in snowstorms, pretty good.  Just the left and right lane were covered with ice.  So everybody's in the middle lane.  You get those people.  The middle lane's fine, but you get people that don't want to do over 35.  Yeah.  So now it forces you into the right or the left lane, which is icy. 
[00:34:00]  You've got to go real slow, but fast enough to pass the car.  Pain in the ass.  People cause an accident.  I know if you're in Arizona listening to this, you're like, whatever, dudes.  But, you know.  Arizona, where they're all happy when it's snowing.  Look, snowy.  They get those occasional snowfalls.  We just want to share in our misery.  So it's 16 degrees today.  It snowed all day yesterday.  And then it turned into rain.  And then the temperature dropped.  So, yeah, everything is iced over.  Yeah.  It just is a pain in the ass.  And so I pull up to the station this morning, and I'm met by a commando. 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Dude, I swear to God, I thought I was living a video game.  I'm like, do I shoot?  Do I run?  Do I have to talk to him because he's with me?  Right.  Do I scale the building and see what happens next?  Did it feel like a real live video game this morning?  Does he have a new weapon for me?  Right.  Exactly.  I just have to talk to him, and I'll get a new cool weapon.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It was Paul.  Of course it was.  You couldn't tell it was Paul because he had some kind of, I don't know, it was like 
[00:35:00]  a paintball outfit on.  That's the only thing I, that's the only thing I could, right?  Paintball outfit?  Yeah.  He did.  It was, you know, I should say uniform, I guess, but it was his paintball outfit.  He's got the face mask on.  Completely covered.  Yeah.  Because it's cold out, you know, so he was wearing the, he was wearing the stuff to  keep warm, but it did kind of look like he was ready to play paintball.  And it looked like he could just take a weapon out in a second.  And he was like, look at the left, look at the right.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Just scanning the area.  I saw him when I passed by doing about 50 in my truck.  And I saw him standing out there.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Poe's now meeting us out front.  So there's no problems.  No problems with some people or anything.  So he asked me if he, you know, wanted to escort me for the entire length of my walk.  And I'm like, nah, I don't need that.  I kind of like the little stroll and, you know, I could see him down the block anyway.  So if there's a problem, I just got to, you know, it's getting hot in here. 
[00:36:00]  I just yell down the block and he'll be there in two seconds.  I can sprint up and beat somebody up.  But I don't need him there for the whole walk.  It was quite impressive.  It was an impressive display this morning.  He told me when I, here he is.  He told me when I got up to the door to go in, he was like, good morning.  Opie has not arrived yet.  I was like, oh, okay.  Kind of something I don't know until I actually get up to the sign-in book.  Right.  And I see, oh, Hughes. 
[00:36:30]  There we go.  Opie's here.  Dude, you just gave everyone my last name.  Oh, sorry.  What's wrong with you?  I screwed up.  Is there anyone that doesn't know that?  Oh, really?  Greg Hughes?  Ooh.  I know.  That's what people.  Got me.  That's what people do when they feel like they know us.  Yeah.  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia.  Oh, you got me.  Wow.  That hasn't been reported.  Did a little research, did you?  Yeah, you Googled.  Fool.  Anyway, Poe, you like your new post in the morning? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, it's not too bad.  The reason why I wear that mask is it was very cold.  It was very cold.  Extremely cold.  You wouldn't wear that on a day where it wasn't freezing, right?  No, of course not.  No, you got to wear that every day now.  Oh, you want to hear like the commando mask?  Yeah, that's your thing.  Okay.  Even if it's 80 degrees in the middle of summer, you got to wear that because it's really impressive.  I'd rather no mask but maybe camouflage makeup, something like that.  Just hanging out like a commando. 
[00:37:30]  It looked like you were ready to hijack something.  I don't know.  Well, I was wearing my jacket.  I just wanted to...  So the jacket, you were able to identify me, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Trust me.  It says my name on it.  Dude, trust me.  We can identify you.  I pretty much knew it was you when I turned the corner, you know, one block away.  There were no other commandos walking in the area.  There was no doubt in my mind that was Poe.  It's like, hmm, which one is Poe?  The guy standing there with the commando mask on and the jacket looking all stout and ready 
[00:38:00]  to kill?  Or the guy that wet himself laying on the sidewalk?  Who looks up every once in a while and goes, who are you?  Yeah, who are you?  When you walk past him, there was a guy that used to stay in a vestibule, but I guess it  was too cold for him.  Yeah.  And he sometimes yells out things at you when he walks by.  I don't like that guy at all.  Might have to tune him up there, Poe.  It's like 12 monkeys out there at that hour.  At that hour, it's 12 monkeys.  12 monkeys.  How you doing, Bob?  Yeah.  They just come walking out of nowhere and up to you and stuff. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I see.  Poe's watching you, Bob.  Right.  It's in the tooth.  It's in the tooth.  That movie gets better and better the more you watch it.  I love 12 monkeys.  The first time I saw 12 monkeys, I was like, what?  It takes a couple of viewings to even understand what's going on.  Yeah.  The whole time you travel.  But then it's just a very, very interesting movie.  Very cool.  And we live 12 monkeys at 4 in the morning.  It's the world of 12 monkeys.  Yeah.  Going to the station, Bob. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Going to the station.  Maybe you should be undercover in the morning, though.  Maybe you should be one of those bums just laying in the doorway.  Because maybe you're a little too obvious.  That's good, though.  It's a deterrent.  Well, you know, I noticed that the guys that normally walk the streets, they were going  across the street.  They weren't walking on my side.  See?  He's a deterrent.  They were.  They were crossing the street.  That's good.  Ben, what's up?  Jesus.  You look like a fucking psychopath when I pulled up.  That's what I'm telling you, man.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  We should have got a picture of your outfit.  Yeah.  Can we get a picture for the website?  Yeah.  With the mask.  And it's just dark.  And you're standing out there, like, you know, with his legs wide open.  When it gets warm, can you just wear the gi?  Stand out there.  Imagine that.  Just, like, throwing air kicks and stuff and spinning back fists.  That'd be cool.  My cab driver was like, who the hell is that guy?  You know?  He's just looking at him.  Oh, yeah.  You want to find out who he is?  Go ahead.  Screw with him.  Yeah, you should just do, like, warm-up moves while you're waiting for us.  57th will just be completely deserted. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Everyone's walking down the other avenues.  All the cabbies.  All the cabbies are taking a quick right right before the building.  One of the busiest streets of Manhattan becomes empty.  Yeah.  Like they're filming a Tom Cruise movie.  They've got to clear everyone out, right?  What was that movie?  You Vanilla Sky?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  That was a stretch of a reference, but thanks for going with it.  Anyway, thanks, Paul.  My pleasure, guys.  And another thing really fast before we move on.  Steve, the Bernie Getz freak out that's been kind of becoming a bit legendary. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, it's great.  I listened to the audio, laughed my ass off.  I love the, you motherfucker.  Well, we didn't have, we had cameras rolling, and then it was like, it was just one of those  things where we kind of, you know, put the cameras down and went about our interview or  whatever or hanging with Bernie.  It was one of those moments that happened so quickly, we didn't have a camera on it because  we weren't expecting it.  Until the end, I guess.  Yeah.  But I forgot, we have security cameras in the studio here. 
[00:41:00]  So, Steve from foundrymusic.com and Master Poe, they spent a long time finding the actual  footage of Bernie Getz freaking out.  And then Steve, you know, synced it up with the audio.  Security camera.  Security camera.  And now it's up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Yeah, it's all linked up.  It's all linked up.  It is really funny to look at.  It looks cool in that kind of grainy security camera look.  It's very, very creepy to look at.  It's just because you've got that, you know, very step-by-step, you know, video of, from 
[00:41:30]  the security cameras.  And those things aren't meant for broadcast.  Those are meant for, you know, what's the word?  Watching black people shoot convenience store workers.  Well, that too.  Is that what you wanted to say, Steve?  That's pretty much the look.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Watch any episode of Wildest Police videos, and you'll see that type of look.  You know what we're talking about.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  It's very grainy.  And it's, you know, we did the best we possibly could.  I'll see if I can get a better version, but it's very difficult because there's no audio 
[00:42:00]  coming through those cameras.  The whole grainy thing works.  It's just...  Oh, absolutely.  It's really cool to look at.  Don't you guys have, like, video at the end of the thing?  Yeah.  What I can do is now go through and match up...  Two cameras shoot.  Yeah, basically.  Match up the video that Danny and I shot to the security camera.  I would do a quick cut to where your video, you know, takes over, and I think that would  be really cool.  Yeah, that's the next step of the process.  This was just, you know...  No, dude, you did a great job. 
[00:42:30]  It's up on Foundry Music and opianthony.com.  Very cool.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com.  We were starting to run, like, promos and commercials for Steve's website, but then  the company got really pissed off.  I don't even know what the problem was, but they told them...  What is the problem?  No more promos or commercials.  Nah, the same problem it was back at the old station.  It's not over yet.  Separation of church and state?  Yeah, basically.  My guess is they'll wind up staying, but...  Huh.  They want you to pay for it?  Is that it? 
[00:43:00]  No.  They won't actually pay for...  It's a valuable, valuable tool for the radio program, and...  Who cares?  There's a lot of smut on there, too.  Actually, we moved most of it off.  That has nothing to do with opianthony.  What's wrong with it?  We moved most of the smut.  The smut is not tastefully done, and we moved all the boobs over to the Rate My Wow site.  Tastefully done.  Yeah, how is Rate My Wow going?  Dude, it's just like...  It's...  I heard there was, like, a million hits the first day.  Yeah, it was...  Not unique, obviously, but...  No, it's...  Well, it's weird.  It's...  Thousands of actual people visited.  It was, like, something like 9,000 or 10,000 people in some very short period of time. 
[00:43:30]  Hits is, like, in terms of pages that people looked at, 1.6 million in the first day.  So, that was...  There are some awful tits on that.  Yeah, they really are, by the way.  Well, it just...  It's a really good one.  It just started, so...  It's a new website called RateMyWow.com.  Is that linked on opianthony.com?  Yeah.  All right.  Everything's linked.  Yeah, it's all linked up, and people just keep sending their boobs.  And Jeff and I wake up in the morning, and we approve the new boobs or disapprove them.  Some people still haven't caught on to the fact that you...  You have to disapprove some? 
[00:44:00]  No, don't disapprove.  No, no, no.  You don't understand.  Like, someone sends in a random picture of a girl.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  We don't know who it is.  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  You don't know who it is.  Because it's funny to get those horror shows.  The real bad ones are the best.  Oh, it's hilarious because it's, like, hot, hot, hot.  You're really starting to get into it, and then...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  That's better.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  This is homer. 
[00:44:30]  So, look at that ratemywow.com.  Yeah, exactly.  As long...  I don't care what they look like, as long as they stick to the whole, you know, show your  boobs, have a little wow sign, it goes up.  Well, it is Whip Them Out Wednesday, by the way.  Oh, it is.  And I got to tell you guys...  19 degrees out.  You know, we live in the New York world here.  We understand this is a national radio show, and it's gorgeous where you're listening, for  the most part.  Who knows?  But that's why we kind of just throw that wow thing out there every Wednesday.  Like, ah, it's wow.  Yeah.  Ah, it's wow.  But we're not really paying attention here in New York.  We're selfish, Opie.  Yeah, because it's 16 degrees out, so we can't really get into it yet. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, we're selfish.  We know that wow is happening elsewhere in the country where it's warmer, and we could  help them out by maybe promoting it a little more on Wednesday than we do.  But it's not doing us any good, so screw you.  Yeah.  When it gets nice around here, then we'll start hitting it a little bit.  Well, that's what I wanted to say.  Ah!  Even though it's 16 degrees, spring is right around the corner.  Yeah, sure it is.  So, basically, if you want to participate in wow or support the radio show, what you need  to do is get your wow stickers and get them on your cars. 
[00:45:30]  Put them on your vehicle.  Yeah.  Next few weeks, just worry about getting your stickers on the cars and the trucks or making  your homemade wow signs or writing it in the dirt, you truckers out there.  We've seen that, and it works beautifully.  And then we're going to start promoting it a lot better.  A lot better.  Right.  So, if you don't have a wow sticker, you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us  here in New York.  The address is up on opianthony.com, but if you have a pen, it's 111 West 57th Street,  New York, New York, Sweet 500. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, you try with that address.  You try, and he's got to throw something at you like that.  Yeah, now everyone's confused.  Yep.  111.  But if you just say 111 West 57th Street, XM, Opie and Anthony, Wow Stick, or whatever,  it's going to get to us.  Yeah.  Okay.  They'll figure out where it is.  Sweet 500, New York, New York, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 9. 
[00:46:30]  All right, cool.  1, 0, 0, 1, 9.  That was the most confusing address ever.  No one will write that down.  Unfortunately, the people that get the address right, they're the ones that are signing  me up for classes and credit cards and everything.  I get things here.  It's like, oh, mail's in.  And I'm like, fan mail from some flounder.  I'm feeling all good.  And I get it.  And it's these jackasses are signing me up for Columbia School of Broadcasting.  I get junk mail here at the studio. 
[00:47:00]  We created our fans.  Monsters, all of them.  They're all a bunch of monsters.  They're just, they're ready to just take over the whole show.  Bunch of tools.  At this point, they don't even need us anymore.  They really don't.  Last night, there was a whole thread on Whackbag about how I'm starting to sound like the deep  voice guy from Steve Ramon promos.  Sure.  And it's saying, you know, because of the Beverly Hills incident and the fact that I'm 
[00:47:30]  spending more on clothing and eating better and things like that.  And I'm making a little more money than I did in the older days that I'm like the deep  voice guy.  So they started just doing a bunch of Ramones and then putting something that's appropriate  for me at the end of it.  And it went on for like five pages, six pages.  Bunch of tools.  They're just ragging on me on the message board.  So I just posted one back.  Said something like, Ramon, reply to these tools. 
[00:48:00]  I think the Ramon thing is dead, unfortunately.  Oh, I still like Steve's.  Yeah, the Steve's are good, but the listeners killed that bit.  The listeners really drilled that one in.  We thought we'd be able to ride that one out for a while, but you guys killed it on us.  So now we have to come up with something else.  Craig from Whack Bag, watching the Bernie video.  Fucking hilarious.  Great to have a visual.  It really is hilarious.  Yeah.  You can see that he just jumped up and went right at me.  You can't really see that Eric's between me and Bernie because the footage is very grainy. 
[00:48:30]  Eric taking the bullet, threw himself right at me.  Oh, and I'm not even going to lie to you guys.  I hid right behind Eric.  There's been times where I have gone after people in the studio, but this instance, I just  was, I hid behind Eric, no problem.  And Eric held back Bernie Goetz.  The video quality for a security cam rocks.  And notice 35 seconds in, Bernie's pointing his finger at Opie exactly like as if he had  a gun.  Really? 
[00:49:00]  Hmm.  Yeah, this is going to be a video that a lot of people watch, I've got to tell you.  Wow.  Because it's just really interesting.  Really interesting.  Where's the 35 seconds?  Yeah, pull it up to 35 seconds.  Let's see where Bernie has a...  Go back.  Yeah, that's good enough.  Let's start it.  He's holding his...  Oh, my God.  That would be boom, boom right there, Opie.  It's like he pointed four times.  Yeah, you're done for.  So, yeah, there you go.  Check that out on foundrymusic.com and opianathlete.com. 
[00:49:30]  So, what happened with Reggie Jackson?  Oh, car wreck.  Yeah, I know.  I was reading a little bit about it, like, you know, he's okay.  And, I don't know, growing up in New York and, well, hating the Yankees for the most part,  you know, Reggie always had this just massive, over-the-top ego.  It was all about Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.  I'm bigger, better, and better than anyone else.  Those were the days.  And even when he retired, he still had that same attitude.  Yep. 
[00:50:00]  Like, his shit didn't stink and all that.  A great ball player, obviously.  Hard to deal with.  So, you know, it was kind of like, you know, crying wolf.  So, all of a sudden, there's like, you know, Reggie's talking about his accident and stuff,  and I'm thinking, oh, here's Reggie again.  And I'm thinking, ah, he was in a little fender bender, but he's going to make it a big deal  because it's about him.  And then he's, you know, because he was in this accident, he's back in the headlines,  and that's the, you know, that's what he wants in the end.  But then I was reading further, and it sounds like this was a horrific accident.  Pretty big wreck.  What, a car hit him going 100 miles an hour? 
[00:50:30]  Rear-ended him.  I don't know how fast he was going.  Yeah, some people have said 100 miles an hour.  Like, he saw this guy coming up on him, and I guess he was already in the right lane,  he's saying, so then he pulled off onto the shoulder, and the guy still hit him on the  right side of the car or something like that.  And then they both started flipping.  Both cars flipped over, started rolling.  Into the median, like, supposedly his car flipped over three or four times.  Yeah.  And the whole time, he's holding onto the steering wheel going, so far, no injuries, so far. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, because those moments take forever.  Right.  And as it's happening, yeah, it's going through your head like, wow, hey, I'm still okay.  I'm still all right.  Rolling, but nothing yet.  Until that beam or guardrail goes right through your chest, and you go, oh, I almost made it.  It's like, oh, this is what happened.  Oh, jeez.  You know, I was rolling and saying, I'm fine.  No, but he, yeah, he wound up rolling, but he's fine.  You know, he's a little injured, but nothing bad like whiplash. 
[00:51:30]  He should have been dead.  An accident like that, someone rear ends, he had 100 miles an hour.  Yeah, so now I feel bad that I was thinking it was just Reggie being Reggie.  He still is, I'm sure.  I'm sure it's Reggie being Reggie.  Reggie was, that was, that was like one of the big heydays of the Yankees back then,  when it was Reggie.  And that's when the boss, when Steinbrenner was the real prick, and him in the legendary  fights with Billy Martin.  So it was cool that, you know, Reggie was in that mix, too, that whole, there's great 
[00:52:00]  dynamic personalities of all of them back then.  But now he's just like, yeah, he's like a complaining old guy.  Every time you see him, he's bitching about something.  So, yeah, when he had this accident, it was like, oh, what?  Right.  Oh, who cares?  Yeah.  But apparently pretty serious.  And then, you know, another headline that's all over the paper is Bill Clinton.  Yeah, he's having some scar tissue and liquid removed, some fluid removed from the left  side of his chest.  It's compressed his lung, the bottom of his lung. 
[00:52:30]  Do they mess up the surgery, you think, or is this something that just happens from time  to time?  I'd say it's one of those rare occurrences, but it's routine.  They try to calm everyone down.  You ever notice that?  Calm all.  It's like calm all.  Calm all.  They try to calm everyone down.  It's, you know, it doesn't happen to everybody, but it's okay.  It's routine, and we call it a low-risk procedure.  It's elective surgery.  This is nothing big.  Low risk or not, Clinton is aging so fast now.  Yeah.  So fast.  Well, he had the bypass. 
[00:53:00]  It was so funny, because I met him just before we started the XM show here.  Yes.  Briefly in Huntington when he was doing a book signing.  Have your picture taken.  Very proud.  I was lucky enough to get a picture with President Clinton that drives Jim Norton nuts to this  day.  And we were all commenting at the time how awful he looked.  And that was, I think, six weeks before he had his heart attack.  Well, he didn't have a heart attack.  No, yeah.  They caught in time.  Yeah, he had some blockage.  Speaking of Jim Norton, hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[00:53:30]  And they wound up doing a bypass.  What, quadruple?  Yeah.  Yeah, they did a quadruple bypass.  What I was going to say, he looked tired, and he didn't look good.  But, he looked a lot younger when I met him than how he looks now.  How he looks now.  And that's only five, six months ago.  Seven months ago, whatever.  You just assumed it was, that he's married to Hillary Clinton.  And that kind of makes you all haggard.  Tired.  They said he also had a partially collapsed lung.  Yeah, that's what he's got, too.  Partially, because his lung can't inflate all the way. 
[00:54:00]  Because he's got this scar tissue and fluid in the left side of his chest.  So, they're going to go in there and drain that out.  And that should reinflate his lung.  And he's running all over the globe with the older Bush guy.  I was going to say.  Trying to keep up with that son of a bitch.  I was going to say, is his new butt, you know, butt buddy pal going to be at the hospital  holding his hand through the surgery?  At the very side.  Right.  Come on, we got things to do.  Right.  You know, all concerned about his health.  Because no one cared about Bush Sr. until he teamed up with Clinton. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Bush Jr. gave his dad something to do.  It was like, all right, Dad, go off with this guy.  Right.  And now they're...  That is the weirdest thing.  Because you just know the Clintons and the Bushes just did not get along.  But apparently...  When Clinton left office and Bush came in, you could just see from the body language of  the transitional period that they hated each other.  The administration hated each other.  And it seemed like it was not just a Democrat-Republican thing.  No, personal.  It just seemed like there was some kind of personal animosity. 
[00:55:00]  Well, the Bush...  Everybody involved in the Bush camp didn't like everyone involved in the Clinton camp because  they were these immoral young liberals that made a mockery of the White House and, of course,  the Oval Office.  So you get these people coming in.  They just want to get rid of everything to do with Clinton and get back to the dignity  of the office.  And it took a while, but they're friends now. 
[00:55:30]  And from what I've read, they're very good friends.  And what they've said is they have a lot more in common than they ever thought they did personally.  And that seems to be the basis of their friendship.  And the younger Bush teamed him up with his father to go over to the tsunami-ravaged...  I'm just looking at Jimmy.  He's catching up on the news.  It's pretty funny.  Like, where am I?  It's like he's going through his workbook.  Well, what we can do, we can take a break, and then we'll say hi to Jimmy. 
[00:56:00]  We'll see how his L.A. trip was.  Did you sleep, Jimmy?  No, on the plane?  Nah, I tried to duck out a little bit, but I just...  Yeah?  Yeah, I kind of just listened to him on my stupid laptop.  Yeah?  Were you in first class?  Yeah, upgrade.  Oh, ooh.  Because you're testing, so they fly your coach.  But that was earnest upgrade.  Earnest upgrade.  All right, why don't we take a quick break, and we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony program.  We'll say hi to old Jimmy Norton next.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O.A. virus. 
[00:56:30]  So I go back to Long Island to go to my doctor's office, get my physical, and he was very happy with everything besides, you know, my stupid illness that I had.  And I'm just about ready to leave, and he goes, one more thing, and he went and got the glove again.  One more thing.  And then I'm like, what?  You did this already.  He goes, well, I should get a stool sample.  Yeah, well, did you take a dump to get that?  That's what I thought. 
[00:57:00]  Pulling one out?  Pulling out a nugget?  So to make a long story short, I have to bend over again and sing Moon River.  Yeah.  Tells me to take the deep breath again.  He goes in.  What is he, poking one that's in there to get the stool?  Oh, God.  The stool sample?  Did he pull something out?  I don't know what he did.  I'm not looking.  You feel him, like, scraping in there to get something?  He doesn't have a mirror on the ceiling or anything.  I don't know what's going on.  But all of a sudden, I think that's what he said, that he needed to get a stool sample. 
[00:57:30]  Because that's what you do when you get your physicals, right?  Yeah, but usually people get that out of a bowl.  That's what I thought.  They take a dump, and they give you, like, a popsicle stamp.  I remember that, yeah, yeah.  It's a plastic thing.  Yeah.  You've got to scoop a little.  Maybe this is the new way they get them.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This guy's a little too eager to snap that glove on his hand every time you walk in there.  So they, yeah, I mean, he went for a poke. 
[00:58:00]  To poke one that's still in me?  I don't know.  Doc, my eye is a little red.  Okay, pull your pants down.  No, not that one.  I'm like, Doc, my ear.  I think I have an ear infection.  Pull your pants down, Opie.  Snap them gloves on again.  But it's my ear.  Yeah, I know.  I've got to stick my finger up your ass off.  I didn't even want to know, man.  I was just like, what are you doing now?  We did this already.  Yeah.  But he said something about a stool sample.  Then he walks out of the office all awkwardly with his, like, his one hand up in the air. 
[00:58:30]  Did he write it in your chart as our second date?  Or was it?  That's pretty, I don't know, twice like that to get a stool.  Oh, he walked out with his finger up in the air?  Well, because I guess he was going for a microscope or something.  He was going to smear it on.  But then what was funny, and this isn't one of those, you know, Ben funny stories, because  it was kind of funny.  So I'm now getting ready to pull my pants up, but of course we don't make eye contact after 
[00:59:00]  this, because now it's like a regular thing.  Hey, how you doing, Doc?  Hey, how many fingers are you going to stick up this pot?  Hey.  What if you bump into him at the grocery store?  Will he stick his finger up your ass?  Hey, how you doing, Opie?  Just want to say hi.  Hey, pull your pants down.  So then he's walking out of the examining room.  I'm, you know, getting myself back together.  Oh.  My hair is all askew, and brushing your hair, and putting on your makeup, and taking the  20 off the dresser.  I'm just trying to get myself back together.  Yeah.  Presentable.  And there's no eye contact, and he's trying to walk out of the examining room. 
[00:59:30]  He has that big white doctor's coat on, right?  Of course he does.  And he's got his one hand up in the air, the right hand, so he's reaching for the door  with the lab.  Yeah, and he's just got a stool sample on the tip of his face.  I didn't look, dude, but his hand was up in the air.  I knew that much.  I wasn't looking closely, I should say.  And then all of a sudden, like, the doorknob gets caught on his lab coat, and he's all  like, he's all like a mess.  Like, he's, he's like, trying to reach back.  He can't use that hand. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  He can't use the hand that's up in the air, and he's awkwardly, like, using the other  hand to try to unhook himself from the doorknob.  Dude, I had to help the doctor.  I'm like, let me get that.  I'm like, oh, God.  So I had to undo his pocket from the doorknob so he could get out of there.  And he awkwardly slams the door, and I'm like, thank God that was over with.  And then he comes back.  Like, nothing happened.  Like, yeah, everything's good then.  Kofi and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:00:30]  Anthony Show.  XM 202.  All in all, you're just a galeric in the wall.  All in all, you're just a galeric in the wall.  What's wrong?  See, when we come out of commercials, or whatever they're called, and go to the music, before 
[01:01:00]  we come back, the music is so loud that I can't put my headphones on.  So I put them on my head like Mickey Mouse, like this.  And then when the music dies down a little, I can put them back on.  See, that's how it works.  It's okay.  It's, you know, that's how every radio station works, right?  Yeah, when the music starts, you got, you got, you got, you got, you got to put your headphones  up here, and then.  And I, I understand the listeners are so sick of us talking about it, but it just amazes  us.  It just amazes us. 
[01:01:30]  Well, a couple more weeks of this, and I'll be, I'm Mark and Anthony Mano.  Didn't wonderful.  My mama, I had the purple hearing before I had the headphones on.  I'm going to be deaf.  I'm going to be deaf.  Because this music just blasts into my eardrums.  I think this studio is built in such a way, there's so many things going on that when something  goes wrong, it's too confusing.  Yep.  You know what I mean?  It's not just one thing, because this thing is related to this, that'll turn this off,  that'll turn that off, which will fade this to the wrong way, and this is going to be 
[01:02:00]  out of phase, because this is wired to this, which is duct taped to this.  You know what I mean?  It's just too screwed up.  You think a bulldozer's got to come in here and just...  Well, look, I'm no engineer, obviously, but it doesn't make sense to me that...  Right now, you can hear my voice, and it's pretty normal in your headphones, right?  A little loud.  A little loud.  Yeah.  But any other audio source is a lot louder?  No, you and every other audio source is loud.  Me, as I talk into this, is just at a level where it's acceptable. 
[01:02:30]  But then...  If I turn it down, then I won't be able to hear myself.  Right.  And I'll hear everything else.  Or if you turn it up to hear yourself, everything else...  Oh, everything else will be like killer.  I'll be bleeding from the ears.  Hey, and that's the problem.  If you're in Washington and you have a solution, give it a try.  It just shows how talented you are.  Thank you, Opie.  That you can work under these conditions, Anthony.  If I'm a professional, I will try to rise above...  It's a catastrophe.  Look at...  I want big bread.  I want big bread for my... 
[01:03:00]  Actually, the sandwich came out fine today.  The income...  We were worried.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Ricky, you know, who gets the orders...  Wrong.  Yeah, Jimmy just shakes his head.  Jimmy hasn't even been around for five days.  He hears the name, oh, Ricky.  The best is, Jimmy, you'll appreciate this, we're in the back office, and Ricky comes  in and goes, well...  He tries to be like a go-getter, like he's going to redeem himself.  He's all confident, and he walks in and goes, well, Travis isn't here today, so I'll be  taking the coffee and food orders. 
[01:03:30]  He goes, I'm going to take the coffee and the food orders all at the same time.  And we all go...  And like, ooh.  So Ben jumps in and goes, how about you just start with coffee?  Yeah.  Let's try to get that right.  And then wise-ass in there, the tall guy, forget his name.  Try to balance the poles on your hand before you start spinning plates on them, you know?  Get it down before you actually start to try a little showmanship.  And then the intern, the tall guy?  Nathaniel.  Nathaniel. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that guy.  That's Nathaniel?  Yeah, he's such a wise-ass, he goes to Ricky.  You know, are you going to get the coffee from...  I don't want to use your...  I don't want to wreck your joke.  You said something like it's at the Green and White Awning or something like that?  Better known as Starbucks?  Help me out.  I don't want to screw up your material.  It's funny.  I said, is Ricky going to the Green and White Sign Cafe?  The Green and White Sign Cafe?  Or as most people call it, Starbucks.  Right.  There you go.  It was very funny.  Made us laugh.  So then I go to Ricky.  Look, Ricky, why don't you just give me a nice... 
[01:04:30]  Let's start really slow.  Just give me a nice, tall glass of water.  Water.  Ask him for water.  If you do that right, then you can go get the coffee for everyone, and then you can  get the food.  But Anthony had no choice.  No one else is here.  So Ricky comes in the studio just as we're about to...  As Ecstasy of Gold is playing.  And all of a sudden, he's holding a pad and a pen next to Anthony, and Anthony's telling  him about this tuna fish sandwich he wants, right?  Yeah.  I want it on toast and everything, and I get it. 
[01:05:00]  Tuna fish at 6 in the morning, by the way.  What is wrong with you?  Yeah, no, I do, yeah.  It's our schedule is stupid.  It has no idea.  Put it this way.  If we were doing afternoons, I would wake up relative the same time to the show.  So it would be breakfast for me anyway, even though I'd be eating lunch.  I wake up.  I just...  I'm hungry.  I don't want to eat something, you know...  But following your logic, it still doesn't make sense you're eating lunch at 6 in the morning.  No, but it's just...  I don't know.  I've been doing the same thing. 
[01:05:30]  Half the reason is because I'm so sick of eating eggs every morning and bagels and everything  Yeah, I've had that goddamn bagel, toasted bagel for months now.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of it.  And I don't want eggs.  So what do you get?  Tuna is kind of a light thing.  So there's Ricky as Anthony's telling him what he wants.  And we're all...  We just have our heads down like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  And everyone in the other booth is laughing their asses off as Ricky's trying to concentrate  like you've never seen someone concentrate before.  I'm like, where are you going to go?  Tuna, white, white toast, make it white toast and a club soda. 
[01:06:00]  And he's looking at me and then he wouldn't leave.  So I'm like, no, that's all.  He goes, oh, okay, all right.  Talking all quiet.  He's all like scared.  He's standing here.  He won't leave.  So I'm like, anything else?  He goes, um, money?  Money?  It's like, oh, just tell me.  Give me money, you idiot.  You know? 
[01:06:30]  The guy was...  He's taking the food order and he wouldn't ask me.  He's too scared to ask for money.  He's petrified now.  You have yourself worked up into a frenzy now about this whole getting food thing.  I love how we have people petrified around us.  They're petrified.  It's kind of a good feeling.  Oh my God.  Yeah, you love shit.  You just love it.  You know, whatever.  You love it.  I'm just an ass, but go ahead, Ricky.  So now everything worked out fine.  The sandwich, by the way, was perfect.  That's cool.  Very easy, right? 
[01:07:00]  I might send you out for something else, though.  Okay.  I've been on this little, you know, cinnamon roll thing.  You know, I kind of like a good cinnamon roll.  It makes the whole studio smell nice and it's tasty and sweet.  Much better than smelling Norton's farts.  Yeah.  Which was a nice pleasure.  Oh, that's right.  Not having you around yesterday.  We sort of missed you, but we didn't miss the smell.  We didn't miss the smell yesterday.  A lovely fragrance.  You think you could handle a cinnamon roll? 
[01:07:30]  Sure.  I don't know where the other guy gets them, whatever his name is.  Well, can he get...  What's his name?  Danny?  Can he get an egg white sandwich at the same place that has the cinnamon rolls?  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  Oh my God.  You're sending him out for something else?  I'm hungry today.  Egg whites?  And I need some fat-free milk and a...  Oh my God.  A spoon.  He pulls out his little Columbo pad.  He's got down his notes on.  Oh, forget it.  A cinnamon roll?  Dude, this is a whole... 
[01:08:00]  C-I-N.  This is a whole process.  Can't we do it during the break?  Yeah.  This is not just a quick food order.  We have to explain in detail.  What?  Cinnamon roll's easy?  What do you want?  Oh, boy.  Jim has absolutely no confidence in Ricky.  No.  Jim comes in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, I need coffee.  I'm like, oh, Ricky Geffrey's like, absolutely not.  Where's Danny?  Ricky, what?  Takes Danny right off the phones.  Danny's answering the phones.  No.  Go.  Well, I think, Rick, I want some skim milk and a banana.  Skim milk and a banana.  And a spoon.  Then where do we get egg whites on, like, a bagel? 
[01:08:30]  Rock and roll dough.  On a good bagel?  Yeah.  Like an everything bagel?  Mm-hmm.  Don't deal with that place downstairs.  Their food sucks.  Egg whites.  Egg whites.  Now, here's, after you have that written down, here's the issue with my cinnamon roll.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I don't know where these places are that these people get these cinnamon rolls.  I don't know where they are.  But one that I get sometimes, it's hard and nasty. 
[01:09:00]  We don't want the hard, nasty, old, stale ones.  Yeah, right there.  I like a cushy, fresh cinnamon roll that's spongy.  Just give it a little squeeze when you...  Not with your fingers.  You want the cinnamon roll...  You can tell by looking at it.  You want the cinnamon roll to feel like 18-year-old boobs.  Ooh.  Yes.  You don't want it to feel like breast implants.  You don't have to look at it.  You can tell by looking at dog crap on the street if it's old and dry and flaky, or if 
[01:09:30]  it's nice, cushy, and soft.  Give it a little poke.  Now, that doesn't mean bring back dog crap, either.  No.  It might do that.  You're a crazy person.  No, I won't.  Just poke at your friend.  Don't poke it, Jimmy.  Shut up about fucking poking.  Yeah, he has to.  Remember the time he put his nail into your apple and you lost your mind, you lunatic.  I'm with Jimmy.  I think you need to take your index finger and give it just a little...  No, there's no poking my cinnamon roll.  Just a little poke.  Watch your hands first, that's all.  No.  Watch your hands.  Watch your hands.  Just a little poke. 
[01:10:00]  A poke where Anthony wouldn't even know that you actually poked it.  You motherfucker.  No.  Just a little like this.  Look, just a little.  Just like that.  No.  Don't keep poking.  Just see if it kind of pushes in a little bit and then comes right back out.  Okay.  All right?  Make sure you poke it.  All right.  There's no poking of my cinnamon roll.  What do you think it is?  Opie's butt?  No fingers involved.  Hey, hey, hey.  So I got some skim milk.  What the doctor?  I know. 
[01:10:30]  Leave your fingers out of my butt.  I want at least, like, can I have at least ten days on the expiration date, too?  I don't like skim milk when it's too close to the fat-free milk.  You know what?  You need to open up the milk and take a sip out of it to make sure it's fresh.  That's what you got to do.  There we go.  Yeah.  Sure.  He's writing that down.  Just swirl it around your mouth a little bit.  And then you can spit it back in the container.  Wine, sure.  Yeah, because he needs it all.  All right, Ricky, get out of here.  And Opie's egg whites?  Chew him a little bit.  And then you can spit that back out because it all looks like it's just scrambled eggs anyway. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, as long as you poke Anthony's cinnamon roll, I don't care.  Cinnamon roll sounds good.  Cinnamon rolls are so cinnamony and good.  They really are a fine morning treat.  Yes, and it's a morningly treat.  Oh, yeah, you need money.  Here you go.  Oh, the money.  See, again, he's afraid to ask.  Doug out, Doug.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Thank you very much for the video.  And I must say, Opie, where does Master Poe actually sit?  Oh, okay.  You're talking about the bird he gets...  He could have freaking killed you.  He got that close.  We're talking about the bird he gets video that's now up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com. 
[01:11:30]  Well, if you were listening to the show that day, Master Poe was listening to a feed of the program in delay.  So he comes bursting in the door when he heard the whole thing go down, but unfortunately he heard it go down seven seconds after everyone else did.  But as security, doesn't he kind of actually watch you guys when you have somebody in there that's shot five people?  Four.  Four, but...  Only four people, sir.  Oh, well, then four.  That's not that bad then.  Yeah, he didn't get to the gun, so I'm lucky enough that I'm not the fifth. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  But, no, it was a whole big deal that day.  Master Poe got so pissed off, now he listens to an actual live feed of the show.  And who was that next to you, Eric, that you were very nicely pushing his head into...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I admitted it on the show.  I hid behind Eric this time.  That was great.  Classic video, guys.  Phones are working great.  Punch it out.  All right, thank you.  Phones are good today, Anthony.  Phones are good.  All right.  Oh, it seems I'm not alone with the blasting of the music through my headphones, because  that's what everybody deals with on a daily basis, listening to this channel. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, like we talk and everything's fine, but then the music comes on and they've got to  turn the volume down, so...  Yeah.  I'm with you, people.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know what to say anymore.  Fast Freddy saying, skim milk and banana.  Gayest snack ever.  Oh, no.  Well, I have a Kellogg's Special K cereal thing here.  I got you.  I'm not just going to sip the milk and eat my banana, dude.  That would be kind of mullish.  Why don't you just...  You know what you should do?  Suck on the banana and splash the milk in your face. 
[01:13:00]  And then slap myself so there's a handprint in my face.  And then take big gulps of the milk and gag on it.  You know, it's for my cereal and the banana.  I'll break up over it and eat it.  You know what?  I think we need a caterer for the program.  We're going to cater the show?  Yeah.  We really should.  Because, first of all, this is getting quite expensive.  Oh.  We need a caterer.  We used to have a bartender for happy hour on the old show.  Why not get a caterer?  Last a couple of weeks.  Comes in every day with the food all set and nice and ready to go. 
[01:13:30]  And we give you a little plug.  Ask the Rock and Roll Deli if they want, you know, a free commercial every morning.  Carlos from Metuchen saying, Jimmy sounds happy.  Because how did his audition go?  Thanks, Carlos, from Metuchen.  Yes.  Carlos wants to know.  Yeah.  How was your L.A. trip?  It was cool, man.  Did you want to have to L.A.?  L.A. has grown on me, to be honest with you.  I like L.A.  I had fun with you guys, man, when I went out there.  I love L.A.  I just wouldn't live there.  Yeah.  I think it's a great place to go from time to time.  If you've got something to do. 
[01:14:00]  Because, you know, you drive around a little bit and you realize, oh, God, what a nightmare.  But if working, if you were working out there and kind of close to where you worked, that  wouldn't be that bad at all.  I think it would be kind of a cool place to live.  As long as you can come back and be based.  I could never be based in L.A.  I just can't.  I love here too much.  Just the quiet there.  Nick DiPaolo was also reading in front of the park, so me and him were in the hotel and  we're just walking around one morning.  It's just like you're looking at life through a glass there.  I don't feel like I'm in the middle of anything because everybody's just driving.  Because you don't live there either.  Well, it's very spread out because of the earthquakes. 
[01:14:30]  I think you're very adaptable once you, if you're living there, then you kind of feel  like you're part of it.  You know?  I'm getting kind of sick of New York, to tell you the truth.  I mean, yeah, I love it because I'm in New York.  I was born here and stuff.  But, man, am I getting tired of this place.  Jesus Christ.  The weather stinks.  The winters blow.  It's like I can't take the animals.  I'm with you.  I'm so sick of it.  I'm so with you.  When this radio thing is over, and I hope it's over sooner than later. 
[01:15:00]  I'm not even lying.  No.  Not even lying with you guys anymore.  I hope this ends sooner than later.  No.  And then it's like bye-bye.  Move somewhere warm and do a little radio show on your own time.  Hell no.  You wouldn't want to have fun?  Maybe spin some.  Do something like that.  Maybe spin some tunes so people can go.  Part time.  Hey, we found one half of the O.P. and Anthony show,  and you're not going to believe what he's doing now. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, I'm doing what I enjoy.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, being on the O.P. and Anthony show afforded me a lifestyle  where I could just do this for fun now.  Yeah, there you go.  Maybe in South Beach, Florida, somewhere nice and warm.  Something like that.  But I'm out sooner than later, boys and girls.  No.  No, this show will go on without me.  It's fine.  No, it's not.  No, not this show.  Hell yeah.  If I continued doing radio, I would absolutely do some kind of a current event-driven show.  Some kind of political talker. 
[01:16:00]  Something like that.  With, you know, a little bit more of an edge to it.  Because that's just, you know, I can't...  I couldn't all of a sudden go,  Okay, I'm Rush Limbaugh now.  You know, appreciate me for that.  And then I'd call your program every once in a while,  so it's like the good old days.  I'm on a phone, and it just doesn't work.  Oh, geez.  Because we haven't talked in years.  You're in a studio.  I'm on a phone.  The chemistry just stinks.  Off the deposit.  But we're trying to relive the glory days.  All right, Opa, I'm going to let you go. 
[01:16:30]  I've got a senator calling in.  I'll let you be.  Yeah.  Enjoy your golf game.  All right.  What are you doing now, Opa?  You got a plug?  Are you spinning music down in South Beach?  What are you doing?  Well, I have a Saturday show in Arizona.  I'm based out of my home.  In Arizona, you've got a studio in your basement.  Right.  Yeah, I spin, you know, songs from the grunge era.  Yeah.  You got a request, Anthony? 
[01:17:00]  All right, could you play some butt trumpet?  I remember that one from the AAF days.  Oh, my goodness.  Who knows what the future holds?  Who knows?  I'll also have a radio show where I just plug gigs and cry and beg you two to come back.  I don't know.  We'll see.  It's called Jimmy's Trying to Pay for His Apartment.  Yes.  It's called It's Too Cold for Jimmy to be Homeless Hour.  I'll play anything you want as long as you listen.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:17:30]  We'll see.  I wouldn't want to get completely out of radio after this if the Opie and Anthony show thing  just ends.  I wouldn't want to get out of radio.  No, you're going to...  Because I kind of enjoy it.  I enjoy coming in and doing it.  See, well, yeah, but here's the difference.  I have 12 years on you.  I know.  You've been doing this a lot longer.  We've been doing it about 10, and I did it about, yeah, at least 10 before I met you. 
[01:18:00]  So after this is over, you've got another 10, and then you'll feel probably what I'm feeling  today.  I'll be like, oh, enough.  Get me out of this.  Oh, that is really funny.  With Dr. Gonzo from Wackbag.  Opie will be the only one listening to your show and buying your paintings.  A little reference from the Brady Bunch earlier.  Very funny.  Yeah, well.  God damn. 
[01:18:30]  Don't quit, guys.  I just want XM to get on the same page as us so I can get the passion back.  I still have passion to do this, but the first five months has been just very, very frustrating,  and I've lost a little of the passion.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's a tribute to how much I enjoy the medium of radio, that I come in here and actually  enjoy myself on a daily basis, even with the obstacles that are in the way as far as  equipment goes, because I really do enjoy doing radio. 
[01:19:00]  It's a lot of fun to just come in.  I'm finally having fun probably only the last month, because something we really haven't  talked about.  I mean, I lost my father literally the day we signed this contract, literally, and then  I took two weeks off and then went right on the road and started promoting our new gig  here at XM, and man, I was in another world, and then we started in October, which was barely  a month after my dad passed, and I'm supposed to, quote, be funny with Anthony, and I don't 
[01:19:30]  even remember being here.  I literally don't remember.  I called it in for the first three months easily, easily, faking it, putting a smile  on my face, but finally, I don't know.  I finally feel that, quote, that's behind me, and I can finally really start enjoying myself  again.  It's just been a weird, weird five, six months.  Strange.  It was supposed to be a happy time for us, well, for me, because we finally got back doing 
[01:20:00]  what we love, and I had that to deal with, which came out of nowhere, obviously.  I mean, people know what happened.  But, yeah, finally, I started to enjoy myself.  Yeah, so I would still, you know, I would try to do something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, it would be a little odd.  Nah.  I couldn't imagine, like, you know.  Nah, dude, you're going to go on and, no, you're going to rock.  Or, you know something?  You're going to be.  Or not.  Or I'd just look around and say, you know something, screw this.  Nah, you're going to be like the next, you'll be like the next Bob Grant. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, now that would be, see, that would be somebody, those footsteps I would like to  follow.  Without that miserable angle, but you'll be like a Bob Grant type.  Hey, I could be miserable.  Very opinionated.  I learned it from you, Opie, okay?  Very opinionated.  I learned it from you.  Where's my oatmeal, you smudgeeam?  Anyway, I don't know what we were talking about.  Jim Norton and I.  Oh, yeah.  Your audition.  Let's go.  How did it go?  I got it.  You got it?  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Yay!  Wait, you got it?  Got it?  They already told you?  Yeah, they told me last night.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That was good.  So now you're going to be on a show.  We don't, no, no.  It's, what happens is, um, we shoot the, well, you got to, let's start from the beginning because  people are confused.  You went out to, um, L.A. for an HBO, um, uh, uh, for a test.  For a test, which I've never done before.  It's like a network test where I did an audition and then I did a callback audition in New York.  And, uh, then it was between me and two other guys, actually a comedian named Fred Stoller  and Steve Sweeney, legendary Boston. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, sure.  Um, and myself.  And we went out there and had to test in front of the network, which was nerve-wracking because  you walk into a conference room.  Oh.  And it's just, it's all network, Chris Albregen, just the highest people at HBO are all just  kind of sitting there.  Oof.  And they don't, and.  All right, funny man.  And they don't think anything's funny.  Um, no, and Louis C.K., who I actually met with the day before, him and the producer,  um, kind of went through it again and gave me a couple pointers.  And this is how nervous I was. 
[01:22:00]  Uh, Dave Becky is Louis' manager and I know him for probably eight years.  I didn't recognize him.  He was in the room because he kind of looks like Dennis Quaid.  So I thought it was Dennis Quaid the whole time I'm in there.  And all you're thinking is, how can I get a picture of it?  I'm like, I know I can't.  I'm like, oh, he must be involved in the project.  Dennis Quaid maybe is doing something or maybe he's an exec producer or doing something.  And it's someone you've known.  For eight to ten years.  You are retarded.  As I'm so nervous and I'm walking out and I'm like, oh my God, that's Dave Becky.  And I'm out the door.  And I felt like I didn't really say hi to the guy.  Too late, yeah.  So I'm such a nervous.  What did you have to do to test? 
[01:22:30]  You have to go in there and do your scene.  Uh, like it's, you walk in, Louis is across the room.  How intimidating is this?  It's nerve-wracking.  It's really nerve-wracking.  And it's a conference room with just, you couldn't even look.  You just know that there are people that can make your career or ruin it.  So you walk in, you have your scene memorized, I guess?  Yeah, I was really nervous when I got there.  But me and DiPaolo, I did it a couple of times in this like big, like off this like room they put us in.  And I was going too fast. 
[01:23:00]  I was like, oh my God, I finally ate this.  Yeah, what were some of your lines?  Um, uh, oh my God.  That's always fun when you do the lines on our show because it never works.  No, never.  It never sounds right.  I'm just trying to think of what one of the ones I kept screwing up was.  Um, something about Planet of the Apes.  I just kept screwing up.  Yeah, I can't remember one line now.  It's so funny.  I did this, I did the whole thing without blowing a line.  I can't remember one line.  So you were just doing a scene that's going to be part of the show, possibly?  The pilot, yeah.  We're definitely shooting the pilot.  I definitely got the pilot.  We're shooting that actually the week that we're off, which is perfect. 
[01:23:30]  I go out to L.A. for that week that we're off at the end of March.  Yes.  Beginning of April, whatever that is.  And I shoot then.  And then they let us know what happens.  Wow.  It will be a while before anything happens, but.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's great.  And what's the basis of the show?  It's like a dirty sitcom on HBO.  It's like a sitcom with profanity and just mean lines.  Oh, perfect for you, man.  Dude, what kind of mean lines?  Just really, really, uh, simple lines.  Do you have a little part for your old buddies? 
[01:24:00]  Your old pals?  No.  Well, here's breaking news.  Jimmy's leaving for HBO, and I'm quitting the business.  And have fun.  That's it.  And I'll be taking your political calls.  Just changing the show tomorrow, and that's it.  See, you guys tuned in like you do every day, and guess what?  The show's blowing up right in front of your eyes.  Jimmy's on, Opie's retiring, Jimmy's on HBO, and I'll be taking your calls about the present  administration, and what?  They won't even like change the sweepers. 
[01:24:30]  They'll just block out the first hit.  The Anthony show.  Dumb Steve will leave the and in there, because he likes it.  The Anthony show.  Ah, that's it.  Just get another guy that mispronounces stuff and has a high voice at times, and no one will  know.  And, you know, people will call in for like six months going, wait, what happened to Opie?  No, I'm here.  That's it?  Yeah, this guy.  And it just doesn't work.  Like, I get some hack comic that isn't even funny, but he's a comedian, so he sits there, 
[01:25:00]  and it's just an awful show.  Well, you could just play sound clips of me.  Nobody would notice it.  Ugh.  Logs on my chest.  Ugh.  Logs on my chest.  Redundant zero AM.  That's good.  I could just put everything on instant replay.  Opie going, taking us to break and stuff like that.  All right.  So name the topic.  What do you think of that topic, Jim?  It stinks, and I don't like it.  So that's exciting news, bro.  Yeah, man.  Very cool.  One of my main concerns was obviously how to interfere with the show and all that stuff,  and I talked to you guys both, obviously, and then I talked to Logan, and I was worried, 
[01:25:30]  but he was like, oh, dude, get the part.  We'll work it.  It'll work.  It'll work.  It'll work.  So it was great.  See, I wasn't worried, because I know I'm stepping aside soon anyway, so it's not going  to affect me.  Yeah.  And, yeah, with the format change, I really don't need you.  Right.  Well, I'm saying that maybe when I'm out in L.A. shooting, for those to be time where I'll  be out in L.A. shooting, maybe the Ben and Anthony show can come out.  That's crazy.  Ben's hog is making an appearance tonight. 
[01:26:00]  That's right.  Ben will be in studio, but Ben's cock will be in P.C. Richards.  All right.  You know, we have to take a very quick break.  No, we're not losing Jimmy.  No.  Jesus.  That was one of my main concerns.  Jesus, that makes me feel good.  I basically am telling people I'm leaving the business.  And they're like, where's Jimmy going?  Where's Jimmy going?  No, they know you're lying.  They know you're full of shit.  They know you're lying. 
[01:26:30]  It'll be like, I don't know if he even gets picked up.  It won't be shot for a while.  And it's only going to be X amount of weeks.  It's not like a sitcom.  10 to 13 episodes maximum, not 22 like a regular sitcom.  And the shoot schedule will work.  My manager actually made them throw in extra plane tickets for me to come back and do like  No, we'll figure it out.  Of course.  It'll actually be a great opportunity for the show to try out Jim Norton replacements  and stuff.  When I told Bob Kelly I had this audition, I almost didn't do the audition. 
[01:27:00]  Anything that will interfere with the show, I'll do.  Honestly, Norton is a friend to the end.  He was stressing the whole time.  And we were the ones going, look, dude, you got to do this, man.  You got to.  We'll figure out how to make it work.  We'll do phone calls from L.A., maybe an audio blog.  Plus, it wouldn't be gone for, you know, a long stretch of time.  It would be here and there.  I'll put it in my contract that once a year I must return here to do the show.  Ralph Brandon.  When he thought he was going off to Hollywood.  You should have, when I was telling Fat Bob Kelly about it, like I'm not too sure what 
[01:27:30]  to do.  I talked to a lot of people about it.  I really didn't know what to do because I had to sign something before I actually  went out there.  Yeah.  And Bob's like, oh, dude, do it, do it.  Oh, you got to do it.  It takes me off.  And I'm thinking, this fat asshole wants to get in here for a week.  He wants to get in here.  Of course he does.  A self-centered boob over the red hair about you.  They're already calling me.  Because you've told all those guys that they're all calling me.  Like, hey, if you need a little help when he's in L.A., you know, I'm available.  I hear Jimmy's leaving, you guys.  I'm around.  No, Jimmy's not leaving us. 
[01:28:00]  I'm not going anywhere.  It'll be an interesting thing.  It'll actually add to the radio program.  Mr. Vitale.  How you doing?  There he is.  Better known as Dick Vitale.  Hey, guys, I can barely hear you.  Oh, God damn.  Even Dick Vitale says that.  Come on, Opie.  Hey, while we're having a problem with the phones, let me try a little something here.  How's that?  A little better?  A little better.  A little better?  Yeah, no, that's better.  All right.  That's a complaint that everyone gives us day in and day out, but for some reason they  just don't know what the problem is.  I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  It's tough.  Where are you calling from?  I'm in Florida right now.  Florida getting ready for the big tourney?  Yeah, I've got to leave tomorrow and I've got to go to the ACC.  I'll be doing five games there.  Very nice.  Tough work, huh?  I've got to be totally honest with you.  I'm usually a huge college basketball fan and I'm not going to try to fake it.  I haven't really followed it this year for some reason.  Maybe because we just started this new gig at XM and I don't have the time.  Well, you're wacky.  You know what I'm saying?  You're not following it.  You're wacky.  It's been great.  Oh, I know.  I know. 
[01:29:00]  Well, I take a peek here and there and I was watching that game over the weekend.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Yes, Dick.  Yeah, I just lost you guys.  Oh, boy.  All these technical problems.  Yeah, that game.  Well, when are we going to, are you going to let me know when we're on?  Huh?  Are you going to let me know when we're on?  When we're on the radio?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll let you know.  Yeah, we'll let you know.  Okay.  Where are you guys located?  Oh, we're in Manhattan. 
[01:29:30]  You're in Manhattan right now?  Yeah.  What's the weather out there?  It's a little cold.  Not as warm as where you are.  I tell you, it's cold out here.  My wife's complaining it's going to be 64 today.  Oh, geez.  Well, what part of Florida?  I live in Sarasota.  Sarasota, yeah.  You know, spring training, the whole bit.  I love it down here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you do when you're not doing the college basketball?  I do a lot of speaking.  I do a lot of, in fact, as soon as the season ends, I'm with the Washington Speakers Bureau,  and I do a lot of motivational speaking around the country for various corporate groups, 
[01:30:00]  et cetera.  So I keep busy, and I've written, not bad for a guy that can't read or write.  I've got seven books.  Yeah.  Do you play golf or anything like that?  Yeah, no, I do.  I play a lot of tennis.  I play tennis, play golf, and I'm not good at golf at all.  I'm a much better tennis player, but I live on a golf course down here in Florida.  It's called Lakewood Ranch Country Club.  Yeah, sure.  Well, I guess we've got about another minute.  We're going to start the interview, so.  Yeah.  What do you think about LeBron James so far? 
[01:30:30]  He's phenomenal.  You know, he's terrific.  Better than Jordan, you think?  He's going to be in that category when it's all said and done, but he has to win yet.  He hasn't won, you know, and obviously he's very young, but that's the one thing that  Jordan did and did so well.  He was such a big-time winner.  You know, getting stats is one thing, but time will tell.  I mean, he's only 20 years old, and Jordan went until he was like 26 or 27, so.  Well, and he's got to get the supporting cast.  Exactly.  He's got to get the cast around him.  He seems like a good kid.  I mean, my little surroundings would him. 
[01:31:00]  It's tough not to get carried away when you're making that kind of cash.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll tell you what I'd like to say, but I'm tired of those New York papers.  Barry and Alex Rodriguez call him the most hated player.  Players don't like him.  It's one reason.  I happen to know Alex well.  They're jealous of the kid.  Of course.  They call him a con man because he's nice.  He cares about his image.  You don't read about him with drugs, alcohol, steroids.  I mean, I find that very frustrating. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the New York papers.  The sports guys are animals.  You guys are heard all over the country.  Oh, yeah.  It's a national show.  We're almost back from break here.  It's amazing, you know, getting back to the LeBron James thing where they're trying to tell these guys they can't go into the NBA.  You know, these high school kids.  Yeah, it's tough.  He's so different.  Yeah, but, I mean, if you have the opportunity to make millions of dollars in the NBA, why shouldn't you?  Well, you know, a kid like that is unique and certainly special, 
[01:32:00]  but there's so many others that make that journey that aren't ready for it.  I mean, he's a rare, like a Tiger Woods or like a Serena Williams.  There's some rare people that just have great, great talent, but when you look at the majority, aren't in that role.  And, unfortunately, there are a lot of kids who think they're LeBron James.  Well, it seems like I think the colleges are afraid because they're going to lose a lot of good players.  I'm telling you, man, I am having a tough time.  I hear you in spurts, you know.  I hear key words like LeBron James. 
[01:32:30]  We're trying to work out the technical glitches.  That's why we haven't, you know, started yet.  You can't get it louder, huh?  Yeah, this seems to be a problem.  I don't know if we're going to have to reschedule or something.  Can you hear now?  Is this possible for you to hear a little?  No, that's better now.  Maybe I might have been speaking too late.  I was saying that it seems that the colleges are really worried that, like,  these young players are going to wind up just skipping college and going right to the pros.  Oh, yeah, it's a big dilemma.  It's a big problem.  I mean, it just seems like it's kind of hard for someone to pass up that kind of money, man.  Because if you're in high school, all of a sudden the team is like, well, you know, we'd really like to. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, most of these kids come from socially disadvantaged situations where, obviously,  in a stroke of a pen, they change their whole life for their family as well.  I mean, one understands that.  True.  Good point.  Can you hear us now?  Yeah, I hear you better now.  All right, because I think we're getting ready to go back into the show.  Okay.  Are you guys on live right now?  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  On the phone line, we've got Dick Vitale. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, Dick.  How you doing, guys?  What's going on, man?  Hey, there he is.  What's going on?  It's been a long time since we've talked to you.  I think we talked to you once on the old show back at WNAW.  Well, let me tell you this, man.  I know you've not been following college hoops like you should, and you've missed a heck  of a lot.  Let me tell you, it has been absolutely phenomenal.  This year, probably better than in the last decade because so many kids came back to school  and didn't go chase those crazy dreams thinking about the NBA. 
[01:34:00]  We had so many great players return, like the kids at Kansas and North Carolina.  It's just been a phenomenal year.  And March, man, this is going to be absolutely awesome, baby.  And I've got to tell you, I've been following college basketball this year like no one's  business, man.  And I think you're right because a lot of these guys didn't jump to the pros, you know?  So these college teams are all stacked with a lot of talent.  Yeah, you're right there.  There's no question.  Opie and Anthony, let me tell you something.  I got fired into pros because my guards look like you two suckers, man. 
[01:34:30]  And that's why I got the Ziggy.  Yeah, I got to tell you, man, Kentucky, Duke, Wake Forest, North Carolina, Illinois,  could be anyone's tournament this year, huh?  Well, I think there's about a dozen teams that could win six games in a row.  I think there are a lot of teams, you know, could go on and win two games and get to the  Sweet 16.  But then you start to separate them when you talk about winning six in a row and being  a national champion.  You just right now hit some of the great ones.  Right now, I look at some of the number one seeds will probably be Illinois, Wake Forest, 
[01:35:00]  certainly North Carolina.  And I think Kentucky might sneak in and get a number one seed.  Yeah, I'd have to agree with you.  Syracuse, a long shot, I'm thinking, this year.  But they're in it again.  Well, no, Syracuse is going to be a very dangerous team with that 2-3 zone.  And certainly if Jerry McNamara and Hakeem Warwick, a great tandem, if they get any help,  they need a third guy to step up and be big and score consistently.  Tell me about it.  That kid that comes off the bench, oh, God, what's his name? 
[01:35:30]  Roberts?  Yes, Roberts.  Roberts or McCroskey or a guy like, well, Pace is certainly a guy that can give them point  production.  But they need somebody to help.  Certainly they're big, too.  And they can create problems.  I think Connecticut's as hot as anybody.  And the reason is Marcus Williams is probably the most improved player in America.  He has really improved with the guard spot.  And their front court for Jim Calhoun has been sensational.  Pulling a wave up, Boone, and certainly Rudy Gay.  Yeah, and with him shooting those jumpers from the outside, it opens up the middle for the 
[01:36:00]  dude on Connecticut there.  Yeah, I tell you what, you know your hoops, man.  Yeah, I know.  That's that defense, baby.  That's right.  I mean, you spread the floor, then you can get the ball in the middle.  What's the guy's name on Connecticut?  I can't believe it.  Are you thinking about Boone or Villamore?  Yes!  Yes, of course.  Yep.  Fantastic.  And what do you think of Gonzaga this year?  I think that's a very, very dangerous basketball team.  Certainly no longer a surprise team, but a team that certainly is going to create problems  again, and very talented, and just won their conference tournament over a really good St. 
[01:36:30]  Mary's team.  And I'm telling you, St.  Mary's is good.  They won 25 games.  I hope the selection committee considers and certainly puts them in a tournament they deserve  to be in.  Sure.  Yeah, Gonzaga, I believe they're rated 10th in the nation now?  Yeah, they're up their high.  And I think they'll be certainly like a number three seed or four at worst.  And I think, again, a team that you'd certainly put in that category as one of the 12 that  would have a chance.  And we haven't had a team win the national title or even get to the final four from the 
[01:37:00]  non-mega conferences, and they're one that can.  The last time it happened was like in 79, where we had a kid from French League, Indiana  named Larry Bird.  We had the magic man there, and we had certainly the University of Pennsylvania was there as  well.  Yeah, it's going to be a very, very exciting tournament this year.  Hey, Dick, the injuries are going to hurt Boston College.  Boston College is certainly a club that has been a real surprise.  In fact, Al Skinner would be my national coach of the year on my awards. 
[01:37:30]  He's done a phenomenal job with that program and certainly a dangerous basketball team.  But I just wonder about their guard play.  If it's good enough to be able to march on to get, you know, we talk about that special  place at the final four.  Yeah, I hear you.  You know, not many people are talking about Maryland this year.  Well, you know, Maryland's right now, you know, is hanging and hanging by a thread.  Barely, right?  They may be playing the NIT, man, for the NIT championship unless they get some wins.  They've got to play Clemson tomorrow in a tournament down in the ACC, and that's a must 
[01:38:00]  game for them because they've lost their last three in a row.  And the bottom line is they need a win badly.  They're 7-9 in conference play.  I think if I were on a committee, and it's truly the 34 best at large teams that get selected  after the 31 automatic burps, there's no one in their right mind can convince me that  Maryland and Georgia Tech aren't two of the best 34 teams that are there.  But again, you look at 7-9 in conference play, that becomes scary in the eyes of the 
[01:38:30]  people that select.  But, Dick, are the injuries going to hurt Georgia Tech this year in a tournament?  Well, you know, the injuries hurt them earlier in the year, but now they've got everybody  back.  And Georgia Tech, a club that I think will be in a tournament.  They had a big win over Clemson for them that was major and over Miami.  So they're sitting at 8-8, and I think they'll be in a tournament.  And they're one of those dangerous teams.  If they're a number 7 or 8 seed, I mean, how would you like to play them in a second round  if you're a number 1 or 2 seed? 
[01:39:00]  I mean, that would be a dangerous spot.  Absolutely.  Dick, who do you think has the heart of a champion this year?  I think the champ's going to come out of Chapel Hill.  I really do.  I think that when I look at North Carolina this year, I think it's going to be their year  to celebrate.  I think Roy Williams is going to finally get that national title that has just escaped  him down to Kansas.  I like this club.  I like their offensive ability.  I like their commitment to the side and defense.  I love the combination of Felton and May.  They've got a great freshman in Marvin Williams, the magnificent one, marvelous Marvin. 
[01:39:30]  I'll tell you, I really like North Carolina.  Don't count out Duke, obviously.  They've got some tough kids, well-coached, and they've got J.J. Reddick, who I would  right now.  If I would cast my ballot today, in fact, I'm casting it today for the John Wooden Award,  and my ballot, I'm telling you guys first, Opie and Anthony, the national player of the  year, I'm going down to Durham, North Carolina, and I'm going, yes, past the envelope, J.J.  Reddick!  Oh, without a doubt. 
[01:40:00]  I like your choice.  Of course.  You know, but some of the fellas on Illinois would have something to say about that.  Yeah, they've got a great guard combination.  I'll tell you.  I've got to tell you.  What a threesome.  And Williams and Brown, and certainly Luther Head, all three have been dynamite all year,  lost a heartbreak at Ohio State, but they accomplished their first goal.  That was the Big Ten Championship, and now they're chasing the Big Ten Tournament.  Dick, we're getting some instant feedbacks here.  Someone's talking about Duke being a good team, but they're saying that the injuries may...  The injuries to Duke?  Right.  Well... 
[01:40:30]  I can barely hear you now, Opie.  No, no, that was Norton.  He was talking about the injuries to Duke, but...  Yeah, you know, they lost Sean Dockery, and that's what's going to hurt, but they've got  the big three when you talk about Reddick and Ewing and Sheldon Williams, and good support  players, and Lee Malchioni has been an incredibly improved player, and really has come on big,  given them a three-point threat, so they've been able to put support players around those  three, they've got a chance to win, and they've got kids that play so hard.  Watch Arizona, too, coming out of the West, Arizona is a very dangerous basketball team. 
[01:41:00]  Salim Stoudemire's had a phenomenal year this year.  He's just done really a great job, especially at clutch time, and Lou Dolson knows how to  win.  I mean, the guy's a big-time Hall of Famer and knows how to win.  So Arizona, you know, Washington's going to be very dangerous.  They're very explosive.  Yep.  So the Pac-10 is a lot better this year than they've been in the past.  Yeah, the Big East isn't really representing this year that much, but...  Well, Connecticut, sure, because I'll tell you, the Big East is a very deep conference,  maybe the deepest in America. 
[01:41:30]  In fact, they're going to have probably...  I think you're going to...  Seven teams are going to come out of the Big East.  Sure.  Well, how about this, Dick?  Your final four?  My final four?  You guys put me on the spot big time, man.  I would see the draw, but right now I'd go with probably Illinois, Wake Forest, North Carolina,  and I'm not sure the fourth.  See, I don't go to the RPI, guys.  I go to the Vital Ball Dome Index.  I go right to my Ball Dome, my VBDI, and it has not been able to give me a fourth team yet.  I have three, but I can't get the fourth. 
[01:42:00]  I have to wait until these tournaments play out at all these conferences.  So right now the VBDI is telling me,  Dickie V, wait a minute, baby, and you guys better go get FHM.  Go get that magazine, because they did a feature on me in that magazine.  And don't you dare to look at the other side of where they did the article on me.  See, the problem is nobody's going to read my article when they go to the other side of the page.  Oh, my God!  All right, well, you said it all. 
[01:42:30]  Well, what is that article about?  It's all about the tournament.  Yeah, yeah.  All about the tournament, Q&A, about working in television.  I hope you guys have seen my DiGiorno ad flying through the air in Dunkin'.  I got to tell you, hilarious.  I had a DiGiorno pizza.  There's a guy, 65, acting 12, Dunkin'.  Remember what I told you now.  It's not delivery.  It's DiGiorno, baby.  I got a new one coming out with Pontiac.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  It's coming out on Sunday with Greg Gumbel. 
[01:43:00]  And then I got one with Hooters.  That's a lot of fun where I'm going fishing.  And the Hooter girl says, I just caught a large mouth.  Oh, man, she really hurt me, man.  She caught a nice, large mouth.  But I'll tell you this.  I'm so happy with the Hooters people because they've donated over $300,000 to one of my favorite charities in memory of my buddy, Jim Valvano, the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research.  And, guys, if you could just simply help us out, we're trying to raise money for battling cancer. 
[01:43:30]  Just anybody that would like to help us, call 1-800-4-Jimmy V. 1-800-4-Jimmy V.  And let's beat that disease that comes after all of us.  Whether we're rich, we're poor, we're black, we're white, we're Catholic, we're Jewish, it doesn't matter, man.  It comes after all of us.  And the only way we're going to beat it is by raising dollars.  All right.  Dick Vitale, it's always a pleasure.  Hey, guys, you want to find out more about the tournament? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Go to my website.  Just go to DickVicowOnline.com every day.  I put up teams to watch, all kinds of information about the tournament.  Make sure you go to my website and make sure when you go there, Opie, I know you need it.  You better buy a Dicky V alarm clock to wake you up in the morning.  Now, you plug whore.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Dick, you're picking Wake Forest.  Wake Forest, a lot of people are not picking them to go as far as you are.  Well, you know, Wake Forest, a lot of people are going to get bumped out because they don't defend really exceptionally well. 
[01:44:30]  They rely on their offense.  But something tells me they're going to respond in a tournament and play on a defensive side as well.  But what about the injuries to the defense?  What about what?  What about the injuries to the defense?  Well, you know, you said something about their defense, right?  The injuries.  Injuries to the defense.  No, their defense really is a situation where they've just got to make a commitment.  If they focus defensively, I mean, they've got themselves a heck of a cast of players.  Chris Poole is as good as it gets to the guard slot. 
[01:45:00]  In fact, I'll lay on you my All-American team.  I gave him my player of the year.  Chris Poole will be my point guard.  J.J. Reddick, my scoring guard.  Hakeem Warwick will be one of my forwards from Syracuse.  Wayne Simeon would be my other forward.  And we're going from down to Utah, man.  Remember this thing.  Andrew Bogut, seven foot from Australia, has been absolutely super for Utah.  Now, look, I even gave you my All-Star, my All-American solid goal team.  I hear you.  I've got to get a T.O., baby. 
[01:45:30]  Dick, the only problem is Connecticut's guarding the perimeter.  Can they do it?  Yeah, they can guard the perimeter.  I'll tell you one thing, man.  You're a little bit down on the Big East.  Don't be so down on them.  Well, you know.  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  I know.  Dick, I thought I knew a lot about college basketball, man.  But you embarrass me every time.  No, no, that's not true.  That's not true.  I wish I had your nice youth, your cash.  Want me some cash, man.  I heard you guys are breaking the bank.  Well, yeah, we make a lot of money, and we got big ones.  Well, let's just make a nice check out to the Jimmy V. Foundation for Cancer Research, will you? 
[01:46:00]  There you go.  Let's not forget about that kid Ewing, though.  Yeah, not bad.  He's very impressive.  I think he's going to do a lot in this tournament.  All right, man.  I've got to go.  All right, Dick.  Thank you.  Let's stick my towel, everyone.  Let's get on with you.  Oh, Dick.  Dick.  Yeah, I hear you.  Oh, my God.  He's good.  It's a switch. 
[01:46:30]  It's a switch with him.  God, was that funny.  Yeah, okay.  We're on.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, baby.  He rocks.  Where's that Steve?  Get Steve in here.  What happened?  There's a...  Did you pull the sound from that Dick Vitale goes ape shit?  That's what I just handed over.  Oh, my God.  I watched the video.  I hear he had a problem with it.  Yeah, that's why I wanted to wait until he was off the air.  He had a big problem with this Camp Chaos bit called Dick Vitale goes ape shit, so I pulled  the audio from it. 
[01:47:00]  It's a flash animation online that's hysterical.  It's, you know, Dick Vitale.  He's out there talking.  He's announcing, and it's just awful language and him doing awful things to himself, and  it's very funny.  I don't know what website it's on.  Could you get it?  Oh, we should have brought it up to him, no?  It's Camp Chaos.  Camp Chaos?  But we have the audio here?  Yeah.  He went...  He didn't like it.  None.  No.  I heard.  None too much.  All right.  Let's take a listen to this. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, baby!  It's me, Dickie V, Dick Vitale, during the greatest month of sports in the entire world!  March Madness, baby!  I can hardly contain myself, because we're coming up on the final stretch, the road to  the big-ass gold trophy, baby!  I'll bet you $100 that I can finish the rest of this pre-game report with a rusty farm tool  lodged in my skull, baby! 
[01:48:00]  Oh, my God!  Dick?  Ah, jeez.  Is he dead?  Check and see if he's dead, please.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Holy shit!  That was like a diaper dandy in Cupcake City, baby!  $100 for me, you fuckfaces!  Dickie V can continue this report with a farm tool in his skull, and with his genitals smashed  by a topless midget with a sledgehammer, baby!  Oh, jeez! 
[01:48:30]  That was...  Oh, God!  Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!  My pecker is like iron!  Like a Marconi man, baby!  March Madness kicks ass!  And the next round is gonna be a dipsy-doo, baby!  And that'll be the upset in today's matchup, baby!  I'm Dickie V!  Enjoy the awesome game!  Coming up, baby!  Wow, we just lived through that. 
[01:49:00]  I know!  But the video of that is up online?  Oh, yeah.  It's very funny.  Which is great.  That is a great website to go to, so.  All right, well.  Welcome.  I hope people enjoyed that interview.  It was very funny.  Because I'll tell you one thing.  We don't know anything about college basketball.  No, that was all written down on these, like, prep sheets.  Like, you could fake it, because you do know a lot about basketball.  A little bit.  And Jimmy, like, nothing.  Just about the injury.  The same injury question.  I almost laughed at one time. 
[01:49:30]  Almost.  Almost.  I did.  I just couldn't even get the question out.  What about the injury?  To enjoy that in the replay, just realize, I do follow college basketball.  I didn't watch one game this year, for whatever reasons.  I had no clue.  None of us had a clue.  And we pulled it off.  I hate college basketball.  I never watch it.  I know nothing about it.  Could you tell who didn't have the sheet in front of him?  I didn't say a peep.  I'm just like, yeah.  Yeah.  Ha ha, that's right.  Yeah, that's going to be a tough one.  Oh, I know. 
[01:50:00]  Very funny.  Dick Vitale.  Okay.  We'll step aside.  What?  Steven Pearcey's coming in at eight, yeah.  And then some gay, black.  Curtis, the gay, black rapper.  He works at Caroline, yeah.  You know, you met Curtis before.  He's gay?  You got to be thinking of a different guy.  Not the big guy.  No.  With the massive, like, earring thing.  Oh, you'll know when you see him. 
[01:50:30]  He's been there for years.  He was usually a gay rapper a long time ago.  I have no idea who he is.  And I've been there a million times.  Oh, Curtis is great.  And then Tawny Peaks is just calling to say hi.  Who's Tawny Peaks?  Porn star.  Porn star.  Oh.  That always works.  Talking to a porn star.  Oh, yeah.  On the phone.  On the phone.  Why not?  You never know.  Get her bio.  We'll fake that interview, too.  On the phone?  Why would we do anything with a porn star on the phone?  She sold her boobs.  She sold her what?  She sold her boobs, Ben?  She sold her implants on eBay.  How much did she get for that? 
[01:51:00]  That, uh, Steve's bringing in.  That's like, who would buy that?  We were at the porn convention.  Who would buy that?  Uh, true.  Who would buy that?  Steve.  Are you kidding me?  Steve.  That's proudly displayed in some, you know, psycho's home right now.  Oof.  Using it as a paperweight or something.  Blood on it.  That's disgusting.  All right, we'll step aside and we'll continue.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the Oaday virus. 
[01:51:30]  And, uh, the brother said that he returned to Jackson's two-bedroom suite at Neverland  after watching a movie in the Rancher Theater, planning to go to sleep.  He said he found Jackson on his back, eyes closed, with his right hand in his underwear,  while Jackson's left hand was in his brother's pants.  His brother turned away from Jackson, uh, was asleep and kind of snoring, the brother said.  I read that.  I read that and thought of your story.  Now I can relate to this situation. 
[01:52:00]  Chuck, have you ever heard this?  No, no, no.  You know, I'm thinking of building a bunch of tree forts at Neverland.  Yeah, I, uh, I was in California and a friend of mine, uh, this friend Richard, uh, we'd  been friends for years and years and years.  Uh, we decided to sleep out at the, uh, the ranch where we kept our, our horses.  So we'd go up into the treehouse and we're talking about everything, girls, horses, everything.  And, uh, finally time to go to sleep.  Right.  So I'm laying there trying to get to sleep and I hear him kind of lean over and he goes, 
[01:52:30]  Can I suck your car?  God.  Oh, God.  And this is after, you know, you're, you're kids.  So you have a few beers and stuff.  So I guess he was loosened up enough.  So all I could do is sit there and go.  And I'm going, Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Just make believe you're asleep.  Just make believe you're asleep.  So.  Just trying to, you know, get him off my scent, you know. 
[01:53:00]  You're not sure whether you can roll over or not.  I'll give you a blowjob.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Whee, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Just trying my best not to budge.  Wow.  If he's sweating, if he's sleeping, why does he have a cold sweat dripping down his head like that?  Oh, it was awful. 
[01:53:30]  So, yeah, I can relate to that kid.  Poor, poor bastard.  Let's call Richard now, shall we?  Richard.  So Michael Jackson.  That would be funny.  Michael Jackson was doing the same thing.  What were you thinking?  So Jackson was doing the same thing.  Perhaps he was doing it.  We drink some Jesus juice.  Go up into the Neverland street, boy.  I'm sleeping, Michael.  I'm sleeping, I'm sleeping. 
[01:54:00]  The chemo makes me sleepy.  I'm sleeping.  Oh, oh.  How awful.  Poor little cancer kid.  That's the deal with Michael Jackson's hand down his pants.  Probably laying there like, what the fuck is this guy doing?  That's when he thought his life didn't get any worse.  Scopey and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The virus is out.

Also, don't forget, we're broadcasting live a week from today, I guess, right?  Today, Thursday?  No, today's Wednesday.  Oh. 
[01:57:30]  Wow, you just can't get that St. Paddy's thing down.  No.  No, I'm still under the weather, too.  Thursday the 17th?  What an idiot.  How stupid am I?  How?  Let's acknowledge how stupid I am.  I'm talking about Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Oh, and then you say, what day is it?  It's a week, right?  Thursday?  I'm on some heavy, heavy crap.  Some good medication.  Some good shit.  No, a week from tomorrow, we're broadcast live from the Hard Rock Cafe right down the street.  Yes.  For St. Paddy's Day. 
[01:58:00]  We're going to have a lot of fun there.  Join us in the morning.  I'd imagine there'll be some wowing.  Your brother's going to do some stuff.  Sure.  We've got some my-fives to give away.  It's starting to shape up to be a nice, nice...  An event.  A nice live broadcast, so...  Yeah.  Keep listening for more details, okay?  All right, we've got some audio to play.  What have we got?  Well, we've got the Diary of a Dead Dog, which is just hilarious.  Hilarious.  We'll put that together.  But before that, I want to just play this thing real fast. 
[01:58:30]  Steve just brought this in.  I don't even know where he got it.  Listen to this.  No, I'll hear you a better one, hon.  That's going to make you sick. 
[01:59:00]  You want more, all right?  That sounds like audio I heard from Lucy and Ness,  these two British chicks that used to do this scat website.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I could not find it.  It's a queef.  Yeah, it's...  You know what it is?  Queefing and laughing at the same time.  Queefing and laughing.  Yeah.  So she's sucking air in and blowing it out.  All right.  Kind of... 
[01:59:30]  What's wrong?  It skeeves me, queefing.  Why?  Just awful.  Because air just rushes in fresh and rushes out not fresh.  Most girls get really embarrassed when that happens.  They should be.  Why?  Stinky, dirty, open holes creating a hazard in the bedroom.  It just means they're really into it.  Yeah, really a big pocket just sucking all the oxygen out of the room.  You've just got to calm them down a little bit.  Calm them all.  Calm them all.  Air pump.  All right, well, we have that.  I couldn't tell what it was, though. 
[02:00:00]  Like, when you just played it.  Oh, I know.  I couldn't tell what it was.  It sounded like it was fake farting or something.  No, I wanted to, you know, have people guessing at home.  Oh.  And now they know we can play it again here.  And it'll all make sense.  No, I'll hear you a better one, home.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's kind of making me sick. 
[02:00:30]  You want more, all right?  Making me sick.  Awful.  That's not supposed to be a sexual thing.  That's supposed to be just a goofy, funny thing.  It's funny, right?  No, it's not.  The only time I want to hear that sound is if a truck tire is running her stomach over.  The last one.  Yeah, just pushes.  She's got stockings on, and the air is forced out so much her shoes just rocket off her feet 
[02:01:00]  and hit pedestrians.  Fills her pantyhose up like sausage casings.  Well, we have a diary of a dead dog, but I think we need to explain this.  Wow.  Because maybe people didn't hear a diary of an unborn child.  Diary of an unborn child.  And then maybe people didn't hear about the Donna Mike thing.  Yeah.  Well, Don and Mike, who was Don's dog, he ran it over in the driveway. 
[02:01:30]  Ran over little Rudy and killed him.  Little Rudy.  Arf!  Arf!  And he was a little distraught about that.  He had to take a day off from work.  Yeah.  And his wife wrote some kind of, like, eulogy on the website about how much the dog meant  to them and stuff like that, and it was just awful.  And Don killed it.  Just ran it over.  Nice.  And then there was a diary of an unborn child, which was this, I don't know, monologue from 
[02:02:00]  this unborn child, a fetus in the womb.  It's some people saying the funniest thing we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio,  and that bit is up on opianathlete.com and foundrymusic.com in case you missed it.  This little childlike voice talking about how it's growing in the womb and how it can't  wait to come out and see its mommy.  And see the world.  As an example, it says something like, you know, September 15th, my fingernails are growing. 
[02:02:30]  It gives, like, a little blow-by-blow description of a child growing in the womb, waiting to come  out and meet its loving mommy.  And it turns out, just short of, you know, reaching its, I guess, third or fourth month  or something like that, the mommy has an abortion.  And the little child inside just says, today, mommy killed me.  Right.  It comes out of the blue.  And then sings some morbid song about how mommy killed me.  It's fantastic.  It's an amazing, amazing bit that we did last week on the show. 
[02:03:00]  I guess somebody took both of those ideas, like peanut butter and chocolate, and put them  together and made something more gooder.  Yeah.  This is called Diary of a Dead Dog.  Uh-huh.  In honor of Don, whose real name is Mike.  Yeah.  In honor of Mike running over his little pet.  Yeah.  As he was leaving his driveway.  August 2002.  I'm a cute little puppy in a pet store on the Upper East Side of New York.  I'm a Cairn Terrier, and boy, am I cute. 
[02:03:30]  September 2002.  I can't wait for a family to take me home.  Look at this lady.  I hope it's not her.  She looks like a real twat.  Christmas 2002.  That fucking twat brought me home, and it sucks here.  I keep hearing two words, career and failure.  February 2003.  It's Valentine's Day, and the fat fuck named Mike still hasn't brushed his teeth.  I think I'll shit on his pillow. 
[02:04:00]  September 2003.  I hate it here.  I've been here for seven dog years.  Nothing works here.  The mouthwash doesn't work.  Thanksgiving 2003.  I'd rather lick my ass than kiss Mike.  Did I mention they named me Rudy after the mayor of New York?  These people are dumber than the ball I chase.  March 2004.  That cunt had my ball sack cut off.  October 2004. 
[02:04:30]  I despise these freaks.  I just ass-fucked Clank.  That'll teach them to eat my kibble.  February 2005.  I'm running away.  They'll never find me, and I'll be happy with a family that doesn't suck ass.  March 2005.  You killed me.  You ran me over because you were late for work.  You'll burn in hell. 
[02:05:00]  I trust in you, you fat fuck.  I trust in you, you fat fuck.  Oh, very funny.  Bravo.  Whoever said that in.  I'd give you credit, but it's not in front of me.  The Diary of a Dead Dog.  That's hilarious.  P-Niggity?  P-Niggity did that, huh?  Another P-Niggity creation, huh?  Very funny. 
[02:05:30]  Nothing works here.  The mouthwash doesn't work.  Still waiting for Stephen Piercy to show up.  Who's that?  Ex-lead singer of Rat.  I went to look up some Rat tribute bands.  There are none.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm thinking they didn't really have enough songs, I guess, maybe to merit a tribute band.  Well, they had that one song.  Round and Round.  Round and Round.  Round and Round.  Everyone remembers Round and Round. 
[02:06:00]  And then there was...  Round and Round.  And then there was...  Round and Round.  What was the follow-up hit to Round and Round?  Square by Square.  Is there any other...  Are there any other hits by them?  Well, then there was that song...  Didn't they have a ballad?  Yeah, it was...  Yeah.  This?  Oh, I kind of remember this. 
[02:06:30]  Round and Round.  No, of course not.  When the vocals kick in.  Alright.  Oh, yeah!  Yeah, I remember this one. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  This certainly is the 80s.  I'd be scared if you step in with me.  You know you really want to lay it down.  Oh, yeah.  Lay it down.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That was it.  Not quite Round and Round, but...  Well, his band has been called the One-Hit Wonder.  Really?  Because, like, VH1...  Like, it matters if VH1 does it to you.  But they did a whole One-Hit Wonder show and Rat...  I love those shows.  And Rat was on that, and I think a lot of Rat fans out there would strongly disagree. 
[02:07:30]  Did they beat Jenny Jenny in the One-Hit Wonder countdown?  They beat the Jenny Jenny song?  Oh, by Tommy Tuttle, right?  Right.  You know, it's...  Oh, God.  This story is to die for.  Oh.  I saw an interview about who that girl Jenny was.  Yeah.  And, like, what the song meant, and it really was a girl named Jenny, and that was her real  phone number.  Really?  Yeah.  That's fascinating stuff. 
[02:08:00]  I gotta tell you.  VH1.  Steve comes running in here with another song, Rat did.  I guarantee no one in this room knows the song, but Steve does.  And Steve is like, no, this is the one.  Because Steve's in a whole different world musically than the average, you know, Joe.  Do you know what Foundry Music was originally?  It's a heavy metal website.  Right, but Steve runs in, like, with this song, like, duh, you missed this one.  Yeah.  And I guarantee that none of us in this room would know it.  All right, let's get it.  And I spun music for a very long time on the radio.  Go ahead, hit it. 
[02:08:30]  This is called Way Cool Junior by Rat.  I might remember it.  Look at Steve.  You don't know this song?  Yeah, what's the matter with you?  I might have heard it once or twice, but, oh, Ben's coming in now saying it was a huge hit.  This was a huge hit in, like, maybe.  Wasn't it weird?  It was a big hit.  It was a big hit. 
[02:09:00]  I never played this on the radio before.  I guarantee you played this at A.A.F.  No, we didn't play this at A.A.F.  No?  No way.  I'm just waiting for the hook.  Yeah.  Right here.  Right about here.  See, that's why radio stinks. 
[02:09:30]  See, that's why radio...  The video was huge on MTV at the end.  They had a chick with a guitar that was naked, walking.  Oh, wow.  Geez, that's every 80s video.  That was a big song.  That's why...  I'll tell you, that's why radio stinks.  Real, you know, real radio.  Commercial radio.  Because the song's not bad at all.  But I, as a DJ, never played that in my whole career.  Round and round.  Played round and round to death. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, of course.  You know, that's why satellite radio's gonna, you know, completely explode.  Commercial radio does stink.  Blows.  But, yeah, I mean, that's a cool-sounding song, but to be honest with you, I never played it,  never heard it in my life.  So, speaking of the devil, I think that's him right there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Got my camera.  Where's my camera?  All right, we're...  Look at you, look at you.  Where's my camera? 
[02:10:30]  God, why is that mic so loud?  It's giving me a headache.  Oh, somebody fix it.  Huh?  Somebody should fix that.  Well, then it's normal.  Someone just has to just redo this studio.  Here we go again.  They have to.  Because it just throws you off your game.  Ben wasn't really yelling, but in my head, it just gave me a migraine.  It's not from all the meds you're on?  I don't know.  You are acting like Bobby Fischer lately.  I can hear the pieces sliding across the board.  God damn it. 
[02:11:00]  Get those cheating communists out of here.  I am on edge, but I mean, Anthony's going through the same thing.  Yeah.  I'm constantly fiddling with the headphone volume here.  And we didn't have to do that until yesterday and today.  I hope they fix this by the time I'm doing my own show and I have John Kerry on.  That's something I'm interviewing.  And then no one's going to give you a chance with your new show because it's not like the  old show.  Even though you're talented enough to do a whole different thing, people will be like, 
[02:11:30]  wait, where are the naked chicks?  I do a whole, yeah, a whole thing on the...  Where's the silly banter about ordering food and stuff?  Taking calls, trying to take calls on the Syrian pullout of Lebanon and people will go,  hey, dude, do some Reagan.  Right.  I'd just be like, oh, forget it.  I'll shoot myself in the head.  Wow would stand for wire on the world.  That would be...  That would be the international stories.  Oh, God damn it.  Am I yelling?  No, it's just bothering me now.  Oh, man. 
[02:12:00]  Eric, rub up here, please.  No, Anthony's...  I mean, and the meters are just pinned, but then I turn it down and then...  I don't know.  Could they just send the big boss up here to just look at this place for two days?  Yeah.  Because things, I think, have to just be rewired at this point.  I think everything's been patched together in such a weird way that...  Pull it all out, put new stuff in.  Just start from scratch, sort of.  A whole weekend or something where they could just rip everything out and run brand new stuff.  So now you're really low.  So now I'm going to turn this up a little bit. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, good luck.  And then all of a sudden I'll get blasted out again.  Yes, you will.  And then just take it out of the game.  I'm trying to ride the mic, too, the whole day.  If I'm talking low, I'm up here.  If I have to go, suck your...  I'm up here.  But then I'm like, ah, I've got to go way far away.  It's like acting.  It's like old-timey radio.  Where we, you know, hey, it's footsteps.  We're coming off the premium.  Hopefully, let's all set a goal.  Oh, a goal.  When we get off the premium, could everything work perfectly so we stop bitching and we could actually do radio every day without bitching about the equipment? 
[02:13:00]  Please.  We'll give it a try.  That's our goal.  That's our goal, right?  The mics are loud enough to hear Jimmy take his phone call.  You know what?  My apologies.  I would never do that.  You have to.  That was Taylor Law.  She's calling to congratulate me.  When I saw her number come up on the caller ID, that's how bad I want to fucking get my hands on her hot body.  I will answer the phone on another radio show.  I really am an asshole.  You have to, though.  She's so hot, man.  Taylor Law from Philly.  Yeah, we love her.  We love her. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, she's done a lot of great stuff for the radio program.  Anyway.  She hasn't done, though.  Let's go from Hot Taylor Law to Kirstie Alley on Letterman.  Oh, for her new show?  Fat Actress.  Anyone watch that last night?  Was it on last night or two nights ago?  Nathaniel, you want to give her a review?  You're the only one that watched it.  All her movies are popping up now, too.  Do you notice this?  I just saw...  Well, because she's hot again.  I know.  I just saw A Runaway with Tom Selleck, Kisses Gene Simmons, and Kirstie Alley was in that one. 
[02:14:00]  She buys it.  Gene Simmons actually sticks her in the back of the neck with a knife and kills her.  She was in that.  And then I saw this other one where she plays...  Who was that woman that was a feminist?  Kate Smith?  No.  She's the feminist that infiltrated the Playboy Bunnies.  Yeah, kind of.  Certainly was Gloria Steinem.  USA played Madhouse not too long ago.  Her and John Larroquette.  They've been rewriting that a lot. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, so all of a sudden, all these bad movies come out, and you go, why are they playing  this?  And then you realize, oh, because Kirstie Alley...  They're actually remaking Runaway.  It's where she walks up to Gene and asks for an autograph, and that's what he does.  Nathaniel, Fat Actress.  It's basically an attempt at sort of a curb your enthusiasm type show.  Really?  Sort of an unscripted thing.  Curb your appetite.  Oh, well.  Yeah, well, it could be.  I brought in some audio from it that's just painfully not funny.  The unfunny drops?  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  I even labeled them as such.  There was no confusion.  So the show was awful?  Yeah, it's just her, like, whining and crying a lot, just making loud crying noises, which  isn't funny or entertaining.  She's trying to steal that whole Anne Nicole Smith vibe, which worked for a little while,  the whole wacky, I'm so unpredictable and emotionally unstable, you never know what I'm going to  do type of crap, and it's forced and disingenuous.  Well, that's the problem with Hollywood.  You know, a show hits, and then everyone feels like they have to jump on top and just,  you know, rip off the idea. 
[02:15:30]  Well, Anne Nicole stunk, too, because she was trying to...  Ozzy's charisma of being unpredictable and on these medications, that was for real.  He wasn't trying to play a character.  He was just out of his mind.  And, you know, of course, she was trying to take it over the top, and she sucked.  Jim Greer from Long Island, jgreer at hotmail.com.  Is that your email address?  J-G-R-E-E-R?  J-G-R-E-E-R?  J-G-R-E-E-R?  At hotmail.com.  What about him?  Maybe our listeners can tell them why we're whining on the air, and why we're whiny faggots 
[02:16:00]  on the air about this, and why we should resolve it off the air like we haven't tried a million  times.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  It's jgreer, G-R-E-E-R, at hotmail.com.  Maybe our listeners can email him and explain to him the situation, you fucking ass cock.  Dick.  See, here's the problem.  We discussed this off-air, but nothing really gets done.  Right.  Sorry to say, Washington, but it just doesn't.  And then it affects, you know, our performance on the air.  You're in the middle of something, and then, you know, the volume in your headphone gets 
[02:16:30]  so loud that it hurts.  Yeah.  What, you're supposed to make believe it's not happening and continue laughing at a bit  or something?  Yeah, Jim.  When you're at work and the gas pump breaks, you know, you bitch about it right there when  you're trying to pump someone's gas.  Right?  You bitch about it right there on the spot.  You don't wait until your workday's over, do you?  Ass.  All right, so we got some drops from Fat Actress with Kirstie Alley. 
[02:17:00]  All right, see, that was really freaking loud.  Mm-hmm.  It really was.  Oh, my God.  It goes right through you.  I'll turn down the volume, but then the list, well, do I?  I'll try this.  I don't know.  I'll turn down my headphone volume, but I...  Hello?  Kirstie.  It's Sam.  How's the diet going? 
[02:17:30]  Really well.  The pounds are just melting off.  What the hell is that?  I think that was her talking to her agent, and just, like, the joke is she's crying because  she's fat.  Oh, but he says, how are you?  And she says, really good.  Like, wait a minute.  But, so she's like, she seems sad, but she says good.  Yeah.  So is this a reality show, or is this...  No.  It's fake.  It's fake.  It's a fake reality show, kind of like Curb Your Enthusiasm?  Exactly.  She's playing herself.  Some other people are playing themselves, like John Travolta and, like, NBC execs. 
[02:18:00]  Boy, does he need another Pulp Fiction.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Although, Stayin' Alive was underrated.  Got a movie out right now.  Which one?  Oh, you said Travolta.  Never mind.  I think of Battles of Earth.  Be cool.  Right?  Yeah, I was thinking...  Yeah, he's got to be cool, but that's, you know, that doesn't look good.  That's a stupid...  But that's what I'm saying.  It looks like a bad sequel.  He's still trying.  Yeah, but he needs, like...  That should have been a good sequel.  He needs, like, one of those big movies that are really good.  And the real star of Pulp Fiction was Sam Jackson, anyway. 
[02:18:30]  I mean, Travolta was very good.  Travolta was great.  But I still preferred Sam Jackson.  I think the dynamic between the two made Samuel L. Jackson look better.  I don't think without Travolta it really would have worked.  All right, let's go to another clip here from Fat Actress.  Listen to me, listen to me.  You know, do you think they said to Marlon Brando, listen, hey, Marlon, you're a little  bit too fucking fat to do Apocalypse?  They are all men.  I can play a man.  I am an actress.  I think that you're forgetting the fact that I have won, what, two, three Emmys and Golden 
[02:19:00]  Globes and many, many People's Choice Awards.  And that, you know what, Sam, that is People's Choice Award.  All right?  They can choose.  They have a choice.  And you know what?  They chose me.  She compared herself to Brando as she was doing that awful acting just there?  Yeah, I just brought that one in because I thought it might piss some people off.  Too bad she can't compare herself to Cheyenne and hang herself. 
[02:19:30]  That's pretty awkward.  She compares herself to Brando and then does the worst acting job ever.  Yep.  Wow, that's really bad.  I thought it was going to be a reality show.  John, we've got to work together.  Didn't we have fun?  Didn't we have fun?  Let's do Look Who's Talking For.  Come on.  Oh, please.  Well, we haven't explored all the possibilities.  I mean, we've never had Talking Cats.  We haven't.  We could have, like, Chris Rock be like the cat.  It's not a good idea.  Wow, this acting is really, really bad.  This bitch stinks.  Really awful.  She's playing herself, too.  But it's not funny in an ironic way. 
[02:20:00]  It's not funny in a parody way.  It just sucks.  It's not, like, detached and hip.  Like, whoa, look what she's doing about the reality thing.  She's kind of goofing on it.  It's awful on every level.  Layer by layer, it stinks.  And she's not honest at all.  When I saw this show, you know, because it's been advertised all over the place,  I was thinking it was an actual reality show.  Me, too, yeah.  Where, you know, this is what she goes through being fat in Hollywood  and how she's, you know, trying to get parts as she tries to lose the weight. 
[02:20:30]  So you see her dieting and really exercising and still taking the calls  and slowly but surely losing the weight.  And then people maybe started to pay more attention to her  because that's what they do in Hollywood, right?  Yeah.  But this is all just play acting.  It's awful.  And it's, like, hack ideas, too.  Like, they talk about setting her up with a black man because they like big butts.  You know, it's just like, that's the next track, actually.  Let's name all the black men that we know.  Okay, I'm going to make a list.  Black men.  Oh, cool, Jay.  Yes.  Lenny Kravitz. 
[02:21:00]  Those guys are always with model girls.  They're with skinny ass girls.  Lenny Kravitz is too small.  Come on, Kravitz is not a cold kid, but her ass is this big.  Colin Powell.  Oh, he's smart.  Yeah.  He's very smart.  He's smart.  Is he married to Condoleezza Rice?  No.  O.J. Simpson.  Yeah, no, my hair's a little too blonde for that right now.  Very true.  Wow.  All right.  You've got to smash that.  Yeah, I just want to make sure you guys would never ask me to pull drops from that again.  No, I'm glad we at least...  That is awful.  At least we took a peek. 
[02:21:30]  Dude, I was going in, man.  Oh, I thought you were throwing...  No way.  You got the assist.  I didn't give it to you for the slam dunk.  That was going in for the three-point range.  No, you got the assist.  All right, so then that's some of the audio of the show.  And then she went on David Letterman.  This is quick.  I'm sure David Letterman will kiss her ass.  I wonder what comedian he bumped to give her more time.  I didn't hear this before the show, but I guarantee he's kissing her ass, unfortunately.  Need an honest talk show host.  But then again, no one would go on it. 
[02:22:00]  Hence the Opie and Anthony program.  Come on.  This is like an old World War II submarine.  It's like an old U-boat that we're in.  We got to kick things and...  Sorry, Jim, but we're going to have to bitch again because, see, this is where the show  is affected.  I want to play a Letterman clip, but now I have to figure out what's wrong with the  CD player.  It says 0086.  Slow the ballast tanks.  Does anyone have an owner's manual for the CD player? 
[02:22:30]  What error is it when it says 001?  86.  86.  That was probably the last year the equipment was working properly.  Sorry, Jim.  I'll just make believe this isn't happening as the CD is jammed in the CD player.  It's jammed right in there.  It's totally jammed.  Opie's hitting the eject button.  There you go.  Does anyone do a Dave Letterman impression?  We'll just make believe this is happening.  Yes, let me do a good Letterman impression.  Well, Nathaniel, glad you came down and performed.  Sit in the dressing room while the credits roll.  You're bumped.  How is that? 
[02:23:00]  All right, well, now it's working.  Nathaniel, he would be thrilled by that anyway.  Thanks for my break.  Yeah, he's actually there.  Mars, you know what?  I don't think it's you because now it queued up.  There's like weird gremlins in this studio.  So here's Kirstie Alley on David Letterman.  Where did all of this begin?  Kind of the new you.  When did this happen?  What happened?  I think I just went on an eating spree.  Right.  You know, and just kept it on, kept it up.  I'm one of those people that sort of more is better. 
[02:23:30]  And it's good for certain things.  Right, right.  And then did it get to the point where you thought, well, I've got to do something about this or is it okay?  Yes, it did because, you know, I have this goal to do handsprings when I'm 90.  I don't know why because I was sort of a gymnast and I thought, you know, I want to be able to do a handspring when I'm 90.  So last summer I was, you know, did my yearly handspring and I almost broke my wrist. 
[02:24:00]  And I fell on my head and then I fell flat on my back.  And I think it was because I was so fat that I crushed myself.  Oh, she is incorrigible.  Stop it.  Oh, my goodness.  You know what she should be forced to do?  Just stand there naked while audience members swing a mallet at her fat chest. 
[02:24:30]  She was, you know, considered pretty hot back in the old days.  Well, she's already started losing weight and she started to look hot again.  I think she's a little over that hump, you know what I mean?  Where I don't think she's ever going to be, you know, that hot again.  Well, she's in her 50s.  Yeah.  She's in her 50s?  Yeah, that's old in Hollywood.  Sometimes the fat, as you get older, the fat keeps the wrinkles from showing, you know?  And then these chicks lose a lot of the weight and then you realize that they're old. 
[02:25:00]  When she's fat, she's just like, wow, that's Kirstie Alley fat.  It looks like she did when she was young, only like inflated with air or something.  But then she loses weight.  It might be grim.  Who knows?  This might be another way of her not, of her justifying her career being over.  Saying, oh, I'm too fat for rolls.  Actually, she's too old.  Oh, there you go.  And she's not getting rolls anyway and she can blame it on the fat.  I like the confidence of Nathaniel.  Yeah.  He's just now hanging out, being part of the show.  He really is just piping in, holding the chair, not confident yet. 
[02:25:30]  He's ready to sit down.  He's like, should I go for the sit down?  He'll be in mid-sentence and he'll kind of pull it back and go, no, well, that's what happened.  Right.  And he'll move forward to the mic.  And then as he'll back up, he'll just kind of accidentally plug it down into it.  And he's part of the show.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  He's having this whole debate in his head.  You know, the guys are really going with it.  I'm on the air with them.  And I brought in this audio and they're appreciating me.  Should I sit down and just join the show?  Is that debate going on in your head just like that?  He's like, my legs are a little tired and there is this seat right there in front of 
[02:26:00]  that microphone.  No one's sitting there.  I won't interrupt.  Right.  I'll just pipe in when I really feel confident.  Yeah.  I thought it'd be a little presumptuous of me to just pop a squat and sure, you know,  start pointing at Derek to fire things.  Writing out little signs for me to read off.  Yeah.  Pieces of paper, sure.  All right.  Here's another clip from Letterman.  And when people like myself would make jokes about you being fat.  Oh, God.  I thought it was so funny.  See, Paul, there you go. 
[02:26:30]  No.  That's why she's here.  I just thought it was so always, always.  Wait.  Oh.  So if you're the host, you can make fun of people being fat.  But if you're a comic performing on the show, no victims in the jokes.  Might offend somebody.  I see.  Yeah.  You know what?  You're missing something else, though, in that audio.  And I'm going to back up.  All right.  Uh-oh.  You could tell that she does not think it's funny at all. 
[02:27:00]  Of course she doesn't.  No fatty thinks it's funny.  Nope.  You're right.  Being made fun of.  You could just tell because she's trying to really sell it.  Even Pat from Wunaki's got those tears running down those red cheeks of his.  Right.  I'm sure.  Listen again as she tries to sell the fact that she thinks it's funny when people make fun of her fatness.  And when people like myself would make jokes about you being fat.  Oh, God.  I thought it was so funny.  See, Paul?  There you go.  No.  That's why she's here.  I just thought it was so always, always, always so funny. 
[02:27:30]  See how she's just over the top selling it?  No, no.  I'm telling you, it's so funny.  Believe me, it's perfectly fine.  No, it's not.  I did.  Somebody with a sense of humor for a chance.  Yeah, it made me want to party in your pants.  What?  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  Even with you in there, it wouldn't be that crowded.  I'd say that's a compelling interview.  All right, we have one more clip.  And we'll move on.  Because Stephen Pierce, he's like, what the F is going on?  I'm just sitting here.  We'll get him in in a second here.  But one more clip from David Letterman.  And is this something that, is this part of your goal?  You're striving to get back into that more active dating?  I want to be promiscuous.  Yeah, all right. 
[02:28:30]  Slightly.  Did you have a promiscuous time?  Yes, I did.  Well, see, I didn't.  You didn't really?  I didn't really.  I'm one of the girls that you make out with me, you marry me.  Okay?  Yeah.  But I don't want to be that anymore.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I don't want to be that girl.  I want to be the girl that you have an affair with for a year.  And then we have to part ways and pretend like we're sad and cry.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I would think that there would be quite a lot of men who would be interested in that 
[02:29:00]  with you.  Yeah.  Those are fatty lovers.  There's guys like that.  Freaks.  Is that right?  Yeah.  But is there anything wrong with that, really?  I think it is if you only want to bang fat girls.  Yeah.  If you only want to bang fat girls.  Oh, that is a great show.  Like talking to Noel Coward.  Oh, that's funny.  What a show.  Great.  Great. 
[02:29:30]  You know what she reminds me of?  She reminds me of a black guy running around with a Sambo mask.  The way she's selling herself.  Yeah.  And pretending it's all.  She's a black guy running around going, how you doing, boss?  Yes.  And pretending that he gets the joke and he's comfortable with the joke when really he  wants to cut your throat for laughing along with him.  She's step it, fetch it, and eat it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  She's going to...  She's step and break it.  She's going to sell the whole fat thing because that's what's happening for her right now and  giving her all this attention.  But let's fast forward a couple years. 
[02:30:00]  The fat actress show goes away and then you see Kirstie Alley balloon back up to where she  is because that's her body type and what she's going to want to do.  That's why most diets don't work.  They work for a short time and then somewhere in your subconscious you just want to eat and  you want to snack and you want to do this and slowly but surely you get fat again, right?  Something tells me she eats a lot to get that fat.  Well, and she will again.  So when this project's over and it's not about her being fat anymore and you see her on the  street and you call her fat, yeah, see how much she really enjoys it. 
[02:30:30]  Banging fat chicks.  All right, why don't we take a quick break and get Stephen Piercy in here.  And yeah, actually there was one today.  Curtis, the gay rapper.  Is he up?  He's out here as well, so.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically it says...  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:31:00]  XM202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Round and round.  We'll love the fun.  We're just getting it tight.  Round and round.  What comes around goes around.  I'll tell you why.  Yeah.  Hi.  Welcome back to the program.  Hope you've got a full mouth. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, how about this?  That mic that Opie says is too loud in his headphones is blaring over the radio.  Everything you hear loud, we hear loud.  Even you and Opie, when you raise your voice as just a smidge, it comes over ear splitting.  I know it doesn't help, but I thought you might like to know.  Can I say the important part of that email is the fact that he wrote smidge?  Smidge.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Being mocked. 
[02:32:00]  It's smidge.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's wrecking the program today.  Yeah.  Because it's just taking us out of the game.  That's why ass head, Jay Greer, that's why jack off, that's why we bring it up on the  air, because the listeners do.  See, now you're really loud in my headphones, but there's levels I could ride here to help  us out a little bit.  The levels are fine.  So that's what doesn't make sense.  Nothing makes sense.  So then, like, Jimmy will talk, his mic will be a little low, so then I turn that up,  and then all of a sudden, I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  How's my level today, guys? 
[02:32:30]  Pretty loud.  It sounds a little high.  Loud through my headphones.  That's what it sounds like.  It's loud through my headphones, but the meter says it's fine.  But if I turn my headphones down where it's not loud anymore, then I can't hear me.  Right.  Well, mine have to be actually...  Ow!  That hurt.  I'm not yelling, though.  I'm just talking normal.  You know what it is?  Contractually, mine have to be a little louder, because the people at HBO want to hear me.  Stupid Jimmy, too.  He's like, guys, did I tell you I have to leave at 9.30 today?  No, I did say that, but...  He got here at 7.15.  I'm like, oh, it must be nice to be part of HBO now, where you can just come and go when you want. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  9.30, he's done.  He's got a dentist appointment.  I'm assuming he's just getting all his teeth capped like they do in Hollywood.  No.  It's a matter of time.  You're going to come in with those awful, perfect, white, big teeth like Voss?  Well, no.  He went to a bad dentist.  No, I'm not changing.  Most guys that get that done go to a real one.  Well, you'll be out there.  You talk to those people long enough.  Really?  Lipo?  I could get the...  And then you'll get some lipo.  Some implants.  Listen to me.  Gregory, Anthony, things are going to be the same.  I actually just want to go for a cleaning, and this woman comes extremely highly recommended. 
[02:33:30]  It's the only appointment she can get me was today.  I made this like two weeks ago.  You get a recommendation for a cleaning?  She's supposed to be very good.  HBO says that she's very good.  Well, I think Gandolfini may go to her.  Uh-oh.  Maybe a few of my co-workers at the company?  Co-workers at the company?  You know, I may call James later and just ask if he can send the car for me to get the  ride out there.  Yeah, I guess you are.  All right.  Well, let's be nice.  When was the last time you got your teeth cleaned?  It's been a while.  But I floss and brush every day.  I'm very...  Oh, you might be all right then.  I'm fine. 
[02:34:00]  I don't have huge buildup.  I mean...  They're still going to take that dang and scrape?  Yeah.  You have to be under a little gas.  A scrape behind the teeth?  That's where it really starts hurting?  Get under the gums.  Did you get gas for the cleaning?  Well, Bob Kelly did.  He's the one that recommended this one, but he said that they really go deep.  Does he try to fuck the little sink that you rinse in?  That you spit out the little swirly sink?  You want to hear something beyond gross?  Probably the worst procedure you could get if you go to a dentist.  I know a guy.  I don't want to call him out.  I think I might have him a few years ago because we told the same little story. 
[02:34:30]  But a friend of mine, his teeth got so bad.  Oh, yeah.  So bad, I guess there's a procedure because your gums start dropping and stuff and they  can't get under anymore.  So the procedure is they cut your gums and then fold them down in sections.  Wow.  So they can clean way deep so you won't have other problems as you move on with your life.  Could you imagine?  No. 
[02:35:00]  They actually take like a...  I imagine you're under.  Oh, great.  You're not under forever.  No, you come back out.  And then they sew you up.  And it's so painful.  Supposedly, it's like four different visits because they...  Here you go.  Front of the bottom teeth, right here, the gum.  Slice.  Slice in the back.  Fold down.  And then they clean that section.  They get the gums back in its place, let that heal for a while, and then you make another 
[02:35:30]  visit and slice, slice, fold it back down, do that section.  It's nice.  Only half your mouth stinks at a time.  So it's like...  I think it's four visits.  I think they do it in sections of...  You know, in four sections.  Could you imagine?  No.  No.  Yeah, we've got to get...  Let's get our guest in here.  Come on.  Let's go.  Hawk, let's move it.  I knew as soon as they started fiddling with your latest problem that I was going to mess 
[02:36:00]  up the whole studio.  I just knew it.  Of course.  Instead of just figuring out what button was pushed that created the latest problem.  Hey, buddy.  Stephen, I'm sorry to make you wait so long.  You might need the headphones.  I might need these.  Well, the studio, it just has a lot of gremlins.  I got it.  We're still kind of fine-turning the place.  Where's my Valium?  Oh, here it is.  There you go.  How's that sound?  Beautiful.  Perfect, right?  Yes.  Stephen Pearcy, obviously, of Rat fame.  Yes.  I'm the Rat Bastard. 
[02:36:30]  No.  You're the Rat Bastard.  I'm just the guy who created that beast, you know?  That's about it.  What?  Are the other guys hijacking it now, or what happened?  I wouldn't like to dwell on that stupid subject, because it actually gets resolved one way or  another next week, actually.  Next week has been going on for years.  Yeah, you know, unfortunately, the band Rat had two entities, corporate, one for touring  and one for, you know, making the records in visual audio DVD, and I think I kind of, I 
[02:37:00]  didn't voluntarily quit.  I just said, we've got to step back here in 2000, and they go, no, we're going to keep  going, we're going to do this, and milk everybody for whatever, and I'm like, we haven't even  gotten on our feet yet here, you know?  So, they got another, they go, we're getting nursing, I go, well, whoop-de-doo, I wasn't  ready to do it, I think I was a mess, you know?  Yeah.  Every which way around, and...  A mess in what way?  Anything you want to talk about?  Yeah.  Come on.  Just think, just think.  Come on, bring it on. 
[02:37:30]  Just think bad, and...  Just think real bad?  Yeah, and, oh, I'm squeaky clean in the last few years.  But, anyway, so, it didn't go down, I didn't tour, and I just, me, you know, nothing gets  in my way, I just went around, over, under, and just started a new project, and went out  again, and all of a sudden, they had a singer, and blah, blah, I'm like, well, whoop-de-doo,  just make sure you pay me, per se, contract, and when you decide to do a record, make sure  you get a hold of me, because you're going to need my signature to do it.  So, they decided, well, we're not going to make a record, but we're going to tour our asses 
[02:38:00]  off and fool everybody, and tell them you're the singer when you're not.  Get out of here.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so, so, it happened, and I got pissed, and then the end result, it went to, to the  highest, uh, whatever on the land, uh, and, it's interesting, because I really don't have,  I really don't want to talk about it much, because, you know, I've waited, I've been  working on this book, Rat Tales.  Yeah, but it's kind of a background.  Yeah, but I've been working on this book, Rat Tales, for a long time, and I'm just waiting  on this one thing to fucking close, so I can have closure, so I can finish this thing, 
[02:38:30]  you know?  Yeah.  So, it's actually good.  It's all good, still.  I just want to know, like, because I was reading about the name itself, and there's  an argument over, you know, who owns rights to the name.  Well, that's it.  One is touring, and I actually gave them my interest in the touring entity, because I found  out the market value sucked.  So, I said, here, sure, go ahead.  But now, when you're just hanging out, like, as kids years ago, who was the guy that actually  said, Rat?  Moi.  It was you.  Well, Rat.  Yeah, I created Rat down to the logo, and et cetera. 
[02:39:00]  Actually, I established the band.  My first band was Mickey Rat, R-A-T-T, from 76 to 1980, when I moved to L.A.  And I brought Mickey Rat to Los Angeles, 1980, went through every musician, you know, to  put it to a level, you know, to compete with the big bands, like the Motley's on the Strip,  and the Per Se Quiet Rites, blah, blah.  And, uh, end result, it's all good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, so I came up with, you know, Mickey Rat is Rat, and that's it. 
[02:39:30]  You know, I hired them, you know, and this all for one, all, you know, all for one,  one for all crap doesn't fucking work.  Like, the guy you create should get paid, period.  And then, uh, yeah.  End of story.  So were they trying to actually tour and not tell people that it was a different singer?  Well, they did.  I'd have promoters call me, especially the last few years, and then fans.  I mean, I've been touring extensively.  I'll do probably, I'll do 100 shows a year.  It doesn't bother me.  You give me 200, I'll do those.  But, uh, you know, I have, I actually had a promoter.  Hey, Steve, you know, remembering from the arena days and whatever. 
[02:40:00]  He's doing this big show.  He books those guys, and he's like, hey, you know,  uh, uh, uh, why weren't you at the show?  And he goes, I thought you were, you were playing.  So he literally approached him.  He says, hey, where's Steve going backstage?  You know, he told me the story.  He goes, I'm backstage looking for him.  I'm like, where are you?  They go, he ain't around.  He's not singing this thing.  He's like, say what?  He goes, that's what I bought.  He told me he ended up taking down half the PA and, and, and, and going to call the show  off because the tickets weren't selling.  When people found out, they go, who in the hell is this?  Wow.  There's only two original guys up there. 
[02:40:30]  Did they try to get some guy that looked like you or sounded like you?  No, actually, they got, I won't even give the guy props.  He's a sweetheart, but you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Opportunist, you know.  I mean, so I think they might be, I think they might be headed towards that Van Halen 3.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I hope not.  My poor, my poor, that poor logo is just being drugged through the mud.  Wow.  So I'm the Rat Bastard.  It's even more exciting.  Now, you can, can you use the name Rat?  Oh, sure.  When you're doing your thing?  Well, the only point I want to make is there, there are just some bands that just should  not go on without their singer. 
[02:41:00]  Well, I did a lot of the writing and I was the, you know, pretty much director and the  art director.  And, and, and, you know, um, yeah, you're, you are correct, sir.  Because sometimes there's like nobody really left from the original lineup.  The singer was so like outstanding or very, uh, recognizable, uh, to the band that once  they're gone, it kind of, you know, it's not the band.  A great example is the Doors, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He just put his head down.  Ian's a, Ian's a buddy of mine, you know.  He's an amazing singer. 
[02:41:30]  I love Colton, everything he's done in, in his, uh, his career.  But when they threw that Doors thing together, I'm like, the Doors without, that's a perfect  example.  The Doors without Jim Morrison.  I got a, I got a great story about, uh, I actually was at the sushi bar in Beverly Hills.  And I was sitting there by myself, dum-de-dum, and I see, uh, the keyboard player, Ray, Ray,  Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray, he's standing there, no disrespect to him, but I was pretty thrown  away.  I go, I would, I like to say hello to everybody.  It's like me meeting Charlton Heston in a liquor store at 7 in the morning. 
[02:42:00]  I'm going to say hello, Moses.  You know, which I did.  So I'm there sitting there at the sushi bar.  I'm like, okay, I'm going to say hello to him.  Uh, the, um, guitar player Kruger had the same publicist as me at the time.  And I went up to him and I go, I go, hey, how are you?  I go, I go, pleasure meeting you, Stephen, blah, blah, blah.  And your buddy, um, I've met and, you know, I, I've almost met all of you guys except for  Jim.  And he looks at me and he goes, don't worry about it.  Just give it some time and you will. 
[02:42:30]  I was like going, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck was that all about?  Guy's telling me, hey, die.  You'll be dead soon.  Okay.  What?  Cause I look like this, you freak.  That could be interpreted as, you know, a dig at him though.  Hey, I've met everybody except Jim, you know, the dead guy.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  It was like, you know, so, and result.  It's all, it's all interesting.  It'll all come to a closure and my nasty little book will rear its truthful head later in the  year.  Now, uh, much like, uh, Motley Crue, I'm sure there's plenty of great backstage stories. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, there's all kinds of great stories.  Things that happen.  Yeah.  Chicks, of course.  Oh, it's worse than that, but it's not just about the, you know, the debauchery, the platinum  debauchery card.  It's about, uh, the rise and default of the once almighty rat band that I created.  It's a story through actually getting there and, uh, going through it in a different way,  more of a personal.  It's not all the, you know, the, the in and out and the, uh, the ultra violence and shit,  you know? 
[02:43:30]  Well, people kind of like hearing that angle of it too, you know, living vicariously through  a rock star and you guys, you know, a party book.  Well, you better have some really good stories if all you got to say is, look, sex, drugs  and rock and roll.  There is more to it, you know?  Yeah, but you know something?  The American people really like those sex stories.  And I'll, and I'll give it to them.  Backstage, you know, everyone likes hearing about those.  Forget backstage, before stage, on stage, on stage.  Did you guys have any groupies?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:44:00]  I'm sorry about him, Steven.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, I had a quota actually in the day.  Literally, I had a quota.  Yeah, I had this, uh, uh, do you like to be called midgets?  Uh, I got, you know, obviously I swiped the idea from Dave.  I said, I'm going to get me a midget to have on stage and give me my booze too.  So I did.  So anyway, I had this guy for a couple years out there.  And yeah, we had a quota of how, what we had to partake to be happy.  And would you look out at the crowd and go, yeah, her, her. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, Steve would do everything.  I would stop the show to get that pee.  Oh, wow.  What was the quota?  Three.  A day?  Three a day, at least.  Three a day.  Three girls a day?  Oh, of course.  Maybe more.  Wow.  No big deal.  No big deal for a rock star.  That's part of the program.  No, I think even before.  Tell the guy that's still trying to get three chicks.  I was going to say, tell the guy that's selling cars, no big deal.  Well, you know, I mean, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's all rock and roll.  Yeah, it certainly is. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  So what are you doing now?  I'm doing quite a lot of things.  I got a, my second solo record is coming out, Fueler.  And, uh, spent a good amount of time on that.  Uh, and developing bands.  I've got my independent label, Top Fuel Records, the past 11, 12 years.  And, and...  Anyone come out of that label?  Well, I'm, I'm independent.  I like the underground.  I don't throw anything out there or try unless it's, it's, it's really developed.  And I'm not willing to fall over myself, you know, establishing my label. 
[02:45:30]  So a bunch of my stuff, collectible compilations, uh, never heard stuff, um, Sin Industries,  LTD out of Phoenix, I signed, uh, a bit back, kind of imploded on me.  It was Rob Halford's, uh, bass player in Fight, um, uh, Tijuana Bullfight.  I'm just trying to establish a great band out of LA, uh, an all-girl band I've been trying  to develop for years, Gash Inc.  That's going to be great.  And, uh, and, um, we got, uh, Eric Ferentino's solo record coming out and good stuff. 
[02:46:00]  I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's good.  And then my solo records and things.  When did you, when did you guys think it was time to call it quits with, uh, with the band?  Was it internal or was it the climate of music itself?  Because I know a lot of bands that were big in the eighties realized in the nineties, it's  over, Johnny, you know, we got to either be able to change or just get out of this.  Yeah.  A lot of people talk about when that Nirvana record hit, it was over for him.  Yeah.  The weak ones. 
[02:46:30]  No, you know, you got to, in this business music, what's left of this music business,  it's entertainment business now, but no, uh, we were, I really wanted the band to stop  and, and, and take a break in 91.  I mean, literally from 1983 to 91, we were just, I mean, no rest for the wicked, even.  I mean, it was record, tour, record, tour, record.  And, and, you know, I have this old expression, I feel like a potato chip that's been stepped  on.  It was worse.  Broken up and stuff. 
[02:47:00]  I had to cancel.  Yeah.  I had, I had, like, you know, I, I believe we, uh, cancel like, uh, about a week of shows  and, you know, it was time to step back.  It hadn't do, it didn't have anything to do with the environment, but it was good timing,  you know, to stop.  And then all that stuff happened.  And then, you know, we just went on hiatus, you know, the band never broke up or anything.  And, uh, I started Arcade on Epic Records for a good few years.  And, and then I saw the catalog wasn't getting stimulated.  So me, I, I'm going, okay, guys, let's do something. 
[02:47:30]  And this was 97.  And I said, we're going to put together a couple, uh, you know, redo some stuff.  And it was collage done on our own, on label and got everybody to pretty much get it back  together.  And then, uh, Robin, you know, uh, died.  And, and, and when that happened, we were out on the road and I kind of then just, you  know, besides everybody just being a mess still, I just kind of said, you know, this is it.  We got to step back and really be careful. 
[02:48:00]  And, uh, did the portrait record in, in 99.  And I didn't like that.  It had good intentions, uh, um, good intentions there with John Claudner.  And I was appreciative, uh, but there was no development.  There was no video.  There was no nothing.  It was just like, okay, here's the record.  Go get them.  And it was like, I've been doing this for years.  I don't like this.  You know, it's not my thing.  Kind of impossible to really get video airplay anyway.  Well, it, that's, that's, that's not true.  But you see the fact that people thought, well, people think like that. 
[02:48:30]  And then everybody thinks like that.  Yep.  And that's what happened.  That's just kind of the way it is.  It's unfortunate, but it is kind of the way it is.  Well, me, I think it's totally relevant to me.  You know, I, I put it out.  You like you don't next, you know, I don't, I don't, in that respect, uh, no biggie.  But, but it was, you know, the timing was interesting and, and we did that.  And, and, you know, when Robin, uh, passed, I, we were out there, you know, it just wasn't 
[02:49:00]  right.  It wasn't right.  And, and then after that, you know, uh, all of a sudden I didn't do this tour they wanted  to do in 2000 going into the red, in red, you know, and, and they go, well, we're going  to grab another guy and do this.  And I, like I said, I just said, well, make sure you just, you know, pay me or me, you  know, I'm the main songwriter of the band, co-writer and, you know, blah, blah.  And the contracts say that this guy, Steve, who created the madness is supposed to be  this after the fact for a term, blah, and it never happened. 
[02:49:30]  So whatever, you know, it's, it, it is what it is.  And I'm a happy camper.  Do you say to yourself, you look at that situation and just go, God damn, how did we fall into  that?  Because it seems to be kind of something that a lot of guys from that era trip into after  a while.  And you wind up being in the middle of it going, I can't believe I'm in lawsuits with my former  bandmates.  This is like, it's so cliche almost.  Well, it's cliche because it's, it's the people who really don't have that quality to create 
[02:50:00]  direct, you know, there's some people who are made to direct and to steer and to whatever.  You get the right parts like I did, but I'm still that director and driver.  And others are just part of the ensemble.  And we write, co-write, et cetera.  But when they started telling the world that I didn't write songs, I didn't write my lyrics,  that I was like a dope head, this and that, which is very hypocritical.  And, uh, you know, uh, that's when I started getting a little pissed off because I'd go, 
[02:50:30]  you know, even if you go on the rat site right now, kids, if you go on that rat site, which  I actually set up for them years ago, um, they don't have credits on the songs.  And then my lyrics are all wrong.  So it's like, you know what?  You're weak.  Step up, you know, put the songwriters, I mean, put, you know, the credit, give credit to those.  Yeah.  I mean, they're taking responsibility, but now they can't fool anybody anymore.  It's been four years.  The band, their, their, their cover band, rat version has actually imploded. 
[02:51:00]  And, and so, you know, you, you, what you give is what you get, you know?  So I'm just waiting for the next chapter and move on.  And I'm just, uh, all right, let's go to Todd on the phones.  Uh, Todd from Virginia.  What's up, Todd?  What's going on, shit dicks?  How you doing?  We got Steven Piercy in studio, man, from rat.  Hey, Steven, got a question for you.  How did, how did Rob die from the Hiv?  Uh, how did he contact that from drugs or from women?  Um, you know, he, I, he, Robin said that he got it from the AIDS and I mean from, uh, the 
[02:51:30]  shooting up and, and, uh, the doing the drugs.  So, uh, you know, well, that's what he says.  Was there a lot of, a lot of drugs, uh, with the band?  A lot of people doing drugs back then?  Of course.  All right, boys, I'll punch you now.  Thanks, man.  Later.  Was there ever drinking at the shows and stuff?  No.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Look at the way he looked at us.  We're fucking professionals, man.  Drinking, that's for beginners.  No kidding.  Actually, yeah.  What was, what was the drug of choice?  The H?  What do you got? 
[02:52:00]  You just did everything?  Nobody gave a shit, you know?  And they claim to have been, you know, the soberest people on the planet and I'm like  going in court and stuff and making me out to be this bad guy and actually some older  judges and people will look and go, oh, we believe these boys, you know, he's the bad  guy.  Well, fuck that.  You know, what comes around, goes around, you know?  And that's what's happened, you know?  Uh, oh yeah, plentiful, like M&Ms, you know?  You get tired of it, you know?  And, you know, me, my forte wasn't the needles and pins. 
[02:52:30]  Mine was a pussy party and the paycheck, you know?  And, but some people, you know, they do their things, they hide it and this and that.  But reality, yeah, we were all fucked up and it was whatever.  It is what it was, you know?  When me and Robin pretty much put this thing, you know, I started the band, me and Robin  pretty much made it its thing.  You know, we didn't care what people thought, we were just doing it.  And to this day, we're very fortunate.  I mean, there ain't too many bands that can plan a tour of this, that for years, I mean, 
[02:53:00]  eventually.  Do you consider yourself lucky?  Because I would assume.  Oh, 100%.  I would assume you were, you know, sharing needles and stuff like that.  I didn't shoot out.  I wasn't into it.  See, my forte wasn't that.  It was mostly pussy, per se, you know, my quota.  You know, I had other dedictions besides.  You're probably real happy you didn't decide to take up that habit, right?  Yeah, thank you.  Considering the needle thing.  Doesn't all the drugs and stuff affect performances?  No, people can function quite well.  Believe it or not, there's many people right now functioning quite well on dope. 
[02:53:30]  But, you know, I don't, it's not a good thing.  Dope isn't good.  We've got to say hi to Tawny Peeks real fast.  Let's say hi.  Tawny.  Hey, good morning.  You're talking to Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and Steven Pearson from Rat.  Nope, the former Rat.  Former Rat vocalist, dude.  What's up, Tawny?  Oh, not much.  Just getting up, getting motivated for the day.  Oh, just wakey-wakey.  Well, actually, I've been up for probably about 45 minutes trying to get some stuff done  around the house, but...  Okay, and... 
[02:54:00]  Where are you?  Are you in New York, or as I call it, the Big Apple?  No, actually, I'm in Detroit.  Detroit.  What does a porn star do in the morning when she wakes up?  Masturbate.  Not a porn star, number one.  Oh, Opie.  Told you, Opie.  Not a porn star.  Don't do that with me.  Can you please clarify for Opie, please?  What have you been saying all morning?  What are you?  Actually, I'm a mom and housewife now.  Yeah, a mom and housewife, Tawny Peeks.  Not a porn star, Tawny Peeks.  No, back in the day, I had to cover Playboy, Voluptuous, Vixen, 98. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, nice.  Oh, you never did porn?  No, I never did hardcore porn.  No, I did not.  No.  I did do pictures for magazines.  Right.  But a lot of people...  Voluptuous, Vixen videos, all...  Wouldn't that be considered...  R-rated.  Wouldn't that be considered porn, though, or no?  I guess, in a sense, yes, but in a sense, no, because when you think porn, you think hardcore.  Yeah, there were a few videos with you in them, though, right?  Yeah, like Voluptuous, Vixen.  I mean, it's R-rated.  You see that kind of stuff on HBO. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, so it's like softcore, they call it.  Exactly.  And it was a lot of girl-on-girl?  No, actually.  No?  Mostly myself.  Just yourself?  Just doing painting, doing stupid things.  I really didn't get into the video part of it.  Painting?  Oh, that's cool.  So we shouldn't call you a slut, obviously.  No, you should not.  Yeah, I know.  Of course not.  A lot of people confuse, like, what softcore is with hardcore.  There's definitely that distinction, because some people will make it.  There is a major distinction.  Yeah, like, get some coffee in your ass. 
[02:55:30]  Like, you didn't show the pink, right?  Pink?  You didn't like pink?  It's a snow-hop social intercourse.  You guys get over it already?  Yeah, get over it.  You know, I try so hard to keep this show on the right track, Tony.  And I get people like Opie and Jimmy, Steve, everybody just making problems for me when  I'm trying to conduct an interview.  That's true.  We don't have you on the phone to talk politics.  Let's be honest with each other.  No, I thought you wanted to know what was going on with eBay. 
[02:56:00]  I guess.  Yeah, definitely.  You did sell your implants on eBay, right?  Yes, I did.  And a lot of people said that, well, that's kind of an odd decision to make.  I mean, do you feel that those people have some kind of, like, you know...  What?  Yeah, I agree.  What the hell are you...  What are you going to do with those?  It was an odd decision to make.  You're absolutely correct.  The way it went down was...  My husband and I were watching Jay Leno on a Friday night, and he had some odd things sold  on eBay.  Well, needless to say, the next day I was cleaning up some covers because we moved the past couple 
[02:56:30]  of years, and I came across with a box with the implants in it, and my husband, I brought  it up to the dentist in the office, and I'm like, look what I found.  And he was like, I thought he tossed those when we moved, and I thought he did too.  And then we started remembering about what was on eBay the night, or what was on Jay Leno the  night before, and I said, do you want to put them on there?  Wow.  And he said, no, we're going to buy them.  Wow.  And I thought, yeah, well, we'll put a high reserve on it, and if they do, we'll take the  kids away for the weekend.  If they don't, we'll just toss them. 
[02:57:00]  Fascinating.  Fascinating.  So that's how it happened.  Wow.  So you sold a part of your body, technically.  No, it wasn't a part of my body.  It was in your body for a long time, and it made you some good money.  I would think selling your implants would be, dare I say, a slutty thing.  Kind of.  Will you guys get over the slutty thing, or I will hang up the phone.  Please do.  Don't hang up the phone.  Tony, I'm sorry.  My question was, eBay has a thing about selling body parts and stuff like that.  Was there a problem with that because they said that that was a body part, or no? 
[02:57:30]  Because eBay does have a weird thing about you can't sell bones or anything like that.  Right.  Well, actually, the implant, in order for me to take it out of the hospital, had to be  sterilized.  I mean, they reuse tools, they're sterilized all the time, so it was completely, it was  fine.  How big do the implants make your tits?  Mammaries.  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.  How big do the implants make your tits?  The mammaries.  Um.  The mammal. 
[02:58:00]  They just, they basically enhanced them after I had my son, because they drooped,  so I had the implants put in to pop them back up again.  It wasn't really to make them much bigger, it was just to.  So when did you stop doing any type of nude modeling?  Ninety-seven.  Ninety-seven was the last time, and then you stopped because of your child?  No, no, no.  I stopped because I wanted to get out of that industry.  Yeah, so at ninety-seven you stopped, um, you stopped selling your body.  Um, actually.  For money.  For money.  You know, so at ninety-seven you decided to live the clean life and stop being a slut. 
[02:58:30]  That's one way to put it.  That's not the way to put it or anything.  For coffee, Steve.  So since ninety-seven you haven't been, uh, too whorish.  Oh, I, I, I, I, I.  Enough.  Um, hello.  I knew she'd hang up.  Boy, get a cup of coffee in ya' first before ya' call.  I knew she was hangin' up.  There was no way.  I couldn't be good enough good cop in that.  No.  Keep her on the fuckin' phone.  My memory's my best. 
[02:59:00]  Ah, who, who is she kidding?  And, and soon as someone says on this show, don't do that or I'm gonna hang up.  I know.  Boy, oh, you got, I'm gonna ruin your show and hang up on you because me and my memories.  Nah.  Do we have the, do we have the Tommy Lee phone call?  We gotta play that for Steven, uh, Piercy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  We have that, right?  Tommy.  Is it short?  He's my gladiator buddy from way back then.  We had a street gang called the gladiators back in 1980.  Really?  When we first hooked up.  Yeah, me and Vince.  Jimmy was in the Lords.  Yeah, gang called the Lords. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  Me, Vince, and, uh, Nicky.  Nicky was leader six.  Robin was King Crosby.  Wow.  Vince was field marshal.  I was rat leader and, uh, it was a good thing.  He was Jimmy Robinson.  Yeah.  I wore a cape and Helen helped me.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  Why don't we take a break?  Let's find the Tommy Lee.  There we go.  Alrighty.  What are we going to talk to Tawny Peaks about?  What did she want to talk about?  That she sold her implants for...  And that she's trying to wake up.  And, like, who cares that she sold her implants?  I forgot the amount, but it was some kind of...  And I did it because my sagging was sagging... 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Great.  My son sagging to...  See what they got on eBay.  I'm going to hang up.  If you say that, I'm going to hang up.  It's like, right when she said that to Ovi, I'm like, well, she's hanging up.  I'm wrong.  There ain't no way he's going to let up.  Like, Ovi's going to go, oh, okay.  Then I won't say it again.  I'm sorry.  I know.  This is our big exclusive interview with Tawny Peaks.  Yeah, there you go.  Don't want to blow the big interview opportunity.  There you go.  Kurt is here, too.  Oh, you want to check out a...  What does he do? 
[03:00:30]  Kurtis, the gay black rapper's here, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's black.  He's not black.  He's very light-skinned, but he's black.  He is.  I know Kurtis for years.  Wouldn't you call him white, though?  No.  Don't get that whole thing.  You've got a drop of black in you.  You're black.  Hey.  If you're more white than black, wouldn't you be white?  Shut up.  Shut up.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying...  That is the rule, though.  If there's a little black in you...  Wait a minute.  And the white is, as we will say, tainted.  That's a black guy?  Yes.  No.  Are you black?  Yeah, he's laughing.  He might be having a... 
[03:01:00]  I don't know.  Steven, you can hang, right?  We'll talk more.  I can hang for a bit.  I got some...  Sure, we can hang a little bit.  Black and white.  Yeah, I said that.  Steve, did we ruin your...  What?  Did we ruin it for you by hanging out...  Your contact over there at the Tawny Peaks camp?  I didn't book that.  No, who booked that?  He had nothing to do with that.  Who booked that?  He had nothing to do with that.  Who booked that?  Who do you think?  The booker?  Uh-oh, now we're in trouble.  The booker, the baker, the candlestick maker?  Now we are in trouble.  Wow, we couldn't get the Sly Stallone interview, but we got the Tawny Peaks interview. 
[03:01:30]  That's all right.  That's all right.  And I woke up my son, their tits sagging.  I was...  I hang up.  Sold them on eBay.  Goodbye.  How much?  She was...  She was not...  Oh, I just woke up.  I'm just...  My sagging son, tits.  I was...  Hello.  Hey, goodbye.  Enough out of you that...  I'm gonna hang out because I am special.  All right, let's get Curtis, the gay black rapper in here.  We'll talk to Steven Peercy a little bit more.  We got the... 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  We got the Tommy Lee hang up.  Yeah.  The Tommy hang up on you?  Yeah.  Well, that just reminded...  I mean, you call the show and go, don't say that or I'm gonna hang up.  What do you expect from us?  Well...  You can't call us out on that stuff.  Yeah, you know the form you're gonna be going to.  Exactly, exactly.  Please be prepared for the war.  I'm gonna challenge that guy in his blackness.  That guy's not black.  He is.  That's the biggest thing I'm challenging.  That guy is absolutely not black.  We don't even care.  I don't care.  He's gay.  You know.  He's not black, though. 
[03:02:30]  He's quiet.  He doesn't really say that.  I don't want him to prove he's gay, but I want to prove...  I want him to prove he's black.  All right.  We got his...  We got a CD.  Let's listen.  Oh, does he have a CD?  Yeah, he's got a CD.  We'll take a break and let's do it after the break.  Cool.  All right, thanks.  I like when Ben takes charge.  Yeah, someone needs to around here.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the Oaday virus.  They had owned a chimp, this couple.  But the chimp had bitten off somebody's thumb, so they had to get rid of it. 
[03:03:00]  So they gave it to this animal sanctuary.  Well, they went to visit the chimp because it was the chimp's birthday.  So they brought the chimp a birthday cake.  And they're standing around trying to, I guess, give this chimp a birthday cake.  And some other chimps...  Now, whether they were in a cage and got out of the cage or they weren't in the cage, I have no idea.  I haven't been able to get that straight from what I've read.  But these chimps attacked the couple. 
[03:03:30]  And at first they bit one of the woman's fingers.  And then the man pushed his wife or this woman out of the way.  And the chimps just attacked this guy mercilessly.  I mean, they fucked him up big time.  The damage report, one was at his head, one was at his foot.  But all the time he was trying to reason with them.  Hey, look, chimps, could you not rip my face off? 
[03:04:00]  What kind of reasoning?  Came around and chomped off my thumb.  The male chimp, the wife said, my husband must have realized we were in deep trouble because he pushed me backwards.  At that time they both went for him.  So he must have seen him go for the woman and thought it was some kind of competition.  Lost all the fingers from both his hands.  Dude, they chewed off every finger that he owned.  And this isn't reattach his fingers stuff.  You know those chimps just like, meh, his fingers. 
[03:04:30]  Ripped an eye out of his socket, so that's gone.  Ripped off his nose, a cheek, his lips, and part of his buttocks in the attack.  They just started eating ass.  And they were tugging on his genitals.  Why couldn't they put that, remember the movie Planet of the Apes?  Yeah, of course.  This sounds like a scene that should have been in the movie.  Yeah, where's the nice, you know, even those apes, they were vicious and stuff. 
[03:05:00]  But at least, you know, all they did was, you cut out his brain, you bloody baboon.  Look at you.  You've ripped off his fingers, lips, and buttocks, cheeks.  Damn you.  Somebody pissed this chimp off.  Those things, how do you reason with that?  To the point of he went to, I mean, did they not see him for about six months?  Probably he was pissed off that they threw him in this animal preserve many years ago.  Yeah.  And he's just been waiting and waiting. 
[03:05:30]  Just waiting.  Waiting.  That son of a bitch will come back.  I know his face.  He'll come back one day.  Is this the son?  Guys, guys, this is the son of a bitch that put me here.  This is the guy with one finger.  Right.  And this is the guy that put me here.  This is the guy I've been telling you about.  Here comes the case selfish.  Now's our chance.  You bite his fingers off.  I'm going to bite his genitals and his butter.  Bobby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The Bobby and Anthony Show, XM202. 
[03:06:00]  Alright, we have another mess of a show on this fine Whippamout Wednesday.  Steven Pearcey in the studio.  Formerly.  Formerly a rat.  I'm the rat bastard.  We're getting along with him.  Very well.  Very well, yes.  Tawny peeks.  Tawny peeks.  She did peek.  I want to thank her for calling the program, whatever the hell that was.  I called her a whore.  She didn't like it.  She was going to hang up on you if you didn't treat her with respect. 
[03:06:30]  Well, she's known for one thing.  What do you want from us?  I'm not a porn star.  Yeah.  Really.  You're an opportunist, though.  You noticed you had your implants in the closet in the attic and had no problem getting  in on eBay as soon as possible.  Yep.  What'd she do?  Take them out and then sold them so now her tits are all flat and weird, wrinkly and floppy?  Yeah, you would have to think they would be a little off if you take implants out.  There's no middle to the story.  So the story, it's like I had to think that I sold them and that's it. 
[03:07:00]  Well, I have questions.  Maybe she had a medical problem.  Did you have other ones put in?  Are they just weird and flat and like fucking pancakes?  I had questions, too, but apparently Opie didn't want anyone asking that.  Alright, well.  Okay, next.  Get her back on the phone.  We have more questions for Tawny.  Alright, Ben's getting her back on the phone.  Boss wants her.  Oh, jeez.  In the meantime, we've got Curtis the gay black rapper in studio.  What up, yo?  I'm looking.  They don't think you're black, Curtis.  I know.  I'm half black, half white, see?  Half black. 
[03:07:30]  There is not a drop of black in you.  No?  No.  This has been black in you before.  Get me.  Oh, God.  Uh-oh.  I hope he's just staring.  I'm just trying to figure this out.  No.  Well, a gay rapper.  He's a white guy.  Doug S.K., I'm the gay Eminem.  Yeah?  The gay version of Eminem.  Rapper or gay first?  What would you consider?  Gay first.  Gay first, rapper second.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  When did you know?  When?  Yeah.  When did you know?  At five.  Yeah.  Five?  Really?  What happened?  You look around and you just decided, eh.  I felt like I was Wonder Woman.  You felt like you were Wonder Woman?  At five, though?  I would have been around with my mother's night candles, eh?  Really?  All right.  I can understand that.  Sure.  And then you get a little older and maybe...  Maybe you get a little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog. 
[03:08:30]  A little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog.  A little dog gets...  Because we have Tony Peeks back on the phone.  Oh, God.  Tony.  Hello?  Hey.  What was the problem?  Well, you guys, I'm not in the business anymore.  I understand.  I'm not.  Secondly, I'm not here to plug anything for myself.  Okay.  I was just doing a favor, because I was asked to do it.  And give you guys a call.  I thought you were going on eBay.  I understood you.  Tony, I would like to apologize on behalf of the program.  program. As I said before, I try to keep things reined in, and there are people here that 
[03:09:00]  just won't. You're calling in as a favor? Yes, she is, and it was really good. How much  did you get for the implants on eBay? It was like $16,700. Having Sylvester Stallone  call in as a favor. He might be doing that. And we're gunning for that, though. Why is  Tawny Peake calling as a favor? She's very nice about it. People asking me to call in.  It was nice. A favor? I was doing it because I was going to tell you guys about the Golden 
[03:09:30]  Palace Casino. That makes us sound quite desperate that you would be the one calling in as a favor.  That is a favor to you. Right. It's not for you. I was doing it as a favor. Not you. I was getting  their name out there because they were quite generous. Right. It gets the favor. Wait,  so Golden Casino. Golden Palace Casino. Golden Palace Casino kind of hooked you up and said,  look, we'd like you to call in, give a few mentions, talk to the guys. Yeah. Yeah,  they actually, they said that you guys would like to talk with me. They asked if I would  do it. I said, sure, I would do it. They bought your implants? What a great company they are 
[03:10:00]  and how they actually asked me if I was going to donate some of the money. And I said, yes,  I am. And I found that they bought your implants. They did, I think. Did you get new ones?  No, I don't have anything. They're all flat now? Is that a medical problem when they're 
[03:10:30]  taken out, Tawny? No, actually, I had a breast reduction. Oh,  you did? So they're not saggy and flat? No. They're not pancake eggs? No. Tawny,  I dated a girl one time who had implants and they actually, she had them on the outside of  the muscle, which caused a problem for her. Do you, like with certain implants because  of, like, the way they're put in? Um, I never really had any problems, no. It's a medical  term. I'm very fortunate, but I haven't been that long. I've got to remember, I was only  in business from 94 to 97. Are you going back into porn? Definitely not. No. Shucks. 
[03:11:00]  Did you have a bad experience in the business? I never belonged there in the first place,  to be honest with you. Why, why is that? How did that happen? It wasn't in me.  That was, hundreds of times. Yeah, right. Because she didn't want to take one in the poop  chute. Ooh, the back, the back's back. It's a really nice place to be here. All right, guys,  well, it was nice talking to you. Wait, wait, Stephen Piercy from, uh, Rat Fame, he's not 
[03:11:30]  in the band anymore. Um, he had a question for you. Well, I think it was answered the other  way. Yeah. Go ahead. I think she did answer it, right? About the, he wanted to know if you  still had the implants, but you said no. Oh, that was it, Stephen? Yeah, I mean, if they  were just, like, flat, because you know how they, yeah, you know, like, soiled eggs,  kind of pancakes. But they're not. She said that they, uh, they take care of that. Oh,  that's good. She actually had a reduction line. Yeah, they take care of that. And, Tawny,  what do you do now? I am a housewife and a mom. I have beautiful children. I have a great  life. Life is good. I gave up the business when I was actually on the top with my playboy cover 
[03:12:00]  coming out, and I could have made a whole bunch more money, but I was blessed because I stopped  when I did. Yeah. How many, uh, how many cops you had? How many kids? Three.  Say. I know you guys worked out with Mark Saving, but I'm sorry I'm not. Oh, I can't do that.  No, you're all right. We're taking a look at, uh, some nude pictures of you. You look very  nice. Yeah, let me see. Or used to, obviously. This is probably quite a long time ago now. 
[03:12:30]  Do you still, uh, do you run, uh, a website? No, I don't. Fuck me hard. Damn.  Damn. Fuck me hard. Damn. Fuck me hard. You guys haven't thanked her. I can hear what's  going on there. Uh, yeah. See?  But Tawny, how is this website able to run with your name?  Beautiful.  Beautiful. 
[03:13:00]  Because I see Tawny...  That's good acting.  I see it's a website.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me.  When I did my photo shoots, I had to sign rights off to the photographer,  and that's why everything's done in my name.  I have nothing to do with it.  You don't get paid from these?  Absolutely not.  No residuals?  Wow.  They can put your nude pictures up there, and you don't get anything from them.  That's what happens when you're young and stupid, guys.  I'm sure you've all experienced something like that. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, you sign...  No, never.  All these pictures are on eatabullet.com.  People are just going there and checking them out.  Sorry?  There's a website called eatabullet.com.  Yeah.  It's like all these nude pictures.  I have no idea.  It's also at steven-piercy.com.  Yeah.  Your pictures are all over that.  Everywhere.  You sign them away, though, right?  You sign away the rights, you don't get any cash.  I'm going to sell my breast implant.  I got paid for the pictures when I did them, signed them off, but I wouldn't know any better.  Is that why you quit the business? 
[03:14:00]  Because you didn't like the business?  Exactly.  You didn't lick the business?  No, not really.  What made you get into it in the first place if you said you didn't belong in it?  You guys really don't want to hear that story.  I kind of do.  That's what I want to hear, is how you got into that business.  I was a very insecure woman.  I should say young girl.  How old were you when you got in?  21.  21.  You're 21.  You're insecure about yourself? 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  I had a child who had a disability, and I was basically told if I cared at all about...  Like I said, it's a long story.  It's not something you really want to hear.  No, it's kind of...  But that's the interesting part.  This is interesting.  The child...  No, your child, you were trying to take care of your child.  What was the matter?  He had to have open heart surgery, and he has Down syndrome.  That is not...  That's terrific. 
[03:15:00]  Stop that.  That's terrific.  Excuse me?  I don't know.  Somebody is hitting buttons here that they probably should...  Exactly.  Tawny, so you're insecure.  So you're insecure, and you have...  Yeah, I was an insecure woman, or young girl at the time, and I was led into something  I didn't want to be in.  By somebody that was, like, domineering, or somebody that was...  Yes, actually, and then I finally came into my own, and when I came into my own, I said,  this is not for me.  Do you still have contact with... 
[03:15:30]  And I cut all ties.  You still have contact with the person that got you into the business?  Yes, and that person is very apologetic, so...  Really?  All about having led you in that direction.  Exactly, because there was a mistake on that person's part as well.  Is it your husband, Tawny?  What is that?  Is it your husband that got you into the business?  No.  No.  I'm not going to tell anybody's names or who it was over the radio.  Just like a relationship.  Was it a friend?  It was a relationship, exactly.  Oh, okay.  Uncle touch her, or...?  No.  Oh.  Nothing like that. 
[03:16:00]  Well, the listeners, I mean, they're instant feedbacking, and they're assuming that you  were touched by an uncle, that's all.  Well...  No.  Touched by an angel.  So you were trying to raise money just to kind of make ends meet, and this is the kind  of direction you went to?  You're absolutely right.  You look back, and you add, kind of wish I didn't go in that direction.  Don't lie behind me!  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.  Yeah.  Wow, that's something, Steve.  That's brilliant.  That's the kind of stuff that I wanted to hear.  I don't really care about the implants and how much they were sold for or anything.  It's that inner story of how you got into this business. 
[03:16:30]  Well, that inner story was a very naive and secure young girl, and got led into something,  and then I finally grew up, I guess.  Came into my own, realized what life was about, and it's not about that business.  It's about family and positive health and relationships.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  Is it hard to keep intimacy, like when stuff like that's going on, like when you go to  work to come home and have intimacy?  It's got to be like a real intimacy blocker, right?  You're talking in the past?  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  I've talked to people in the business.  They say it's hard to be in an intimate relationship when you're going off and having very unintimate 
[03:17:00]  sex, and then you come back home, and it's hard to separate the two.  Well, I was never going off having sex anywhere.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Let's get into it.  Get stoked.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Everybody.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get recording. Let's get recording in here. Let's get recording. Let's get recording in here. Let's get recording. Let's get recording in here. 
[03:17:30]  Hello.  Come on.  Lee?  Do you think that a lot of people, like one of the problems people who rail against the adult industry say is that a lot of people are kind of led in a certain direction and kind of are misled about what the business is going to be.  Did you find that happened with you?  Yes, absolutely.  Really? You had this impression that it was going to be one thing and it turned out to be something completely different? 
[03:18:00]  A bunch of things.  No, actually, it just turned out not to be for me.  Are you exploitive?  Are you still a chubby woman these days?  Chubby?  Thanks, actually.  Like when people want to see you naked at this point?  Average, yeah.  Well, when you get out of the business, I guess, you know, life goes on.  Life does go on. Actually, life began.  Aww.  Seriously.  You did it, really? You got a whole new outlook on life?  I have a wonderful outlook on life. 
[03:18:30]  How relieved were you when you finally moved on and said, let me close the chapter?  Well, it's like this. I have no shame. I have no guilt.  Right, right, right.  There you go.  I don't.  And why should you?  That's right. You shouldn't.  No, I shouldn't because what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  Hey, did you make that up?  Yeah, I did.  That's a good one.  You got that hanging on your wall at home?  With the cat holding on, it says, hang in there, baby.  No, it's actually, I mean, it's like, did you have... 
[03:19:00]  Were you walking in the sand with, like, two sets of footprints and then also...  Yeah, I love that one, too.  There's one set of footprints and...  Sometimes when people perform, they get, like, a big head.  That's true.  And it squirts.  I'm sorry. I can barely hear you.  One set of footprints is really nice, like a woman's, and the other is this big, fat mess  of feet that are really much too wide for shoes.  I don't understand it at all. 
[03:19:30]  Me neither.  But that's a...  See, it's an inspiring story.  Write a book.  You should write a book.  You should write a book.  If anybody can go through what I went through and end up how I am, if I can do it, anybody  can do it.  It's a very inspiring story for people out there who think that they're stuck, that think  that they're going to be pigeonholed, put into something, category that...  That's a book.  ...they're going to be stuck with for life.  It's not true.  Have people approached you about a book or a movie about your life?  Quite a while ago.  People were talking to me about it when I... 
[03:20:00]  I actually did a lot of talk shows right when I was getting out of the business.  I did the Maury Povitz show and I helped...  Oh, Maury.  Oh, Maury.  What happened to him?  Maury turned into Jerry Springer.  Is he still around?  You are not the baby's father.  Let's be honest.  You are not the baby's father.  Exactly.  Prior to the not-the-baby-father date.  Let's be honest.  No one would read a book about this horse shit.  No, but I did some shows with them and I was helping a lot of young girls who were lost  on the show.  Oh, that's good. 
[03:20:30]  Did they have the boot camp guy come out?  Yes.  It was myself and him.  Of course they did.  He was a bad cop.  I was a good cop.  The highlight of your career was a Maury Povich appearance.  That's not bad.  That's not the highlight.  It's just part of her life.  She's helping people out.  She's a chicken head.  Are you trying to steer people away from the things you think are mistakes that you made?  Are you trying to steer them out of that direction?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was trying to...  Yeah, exactly.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had and I've had him all over the world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand. 
[03:21:00]  Well, that's...  I find it inspiring.  Something to be proud of, though.  After the Progeria Kids segment, they rolled your fat ass out.  Hey.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Oh, my God.  Feelings.  Nothing more than feelings.  You know, a try.  You're a goddamn try and you have to put up with this.  That's one for the resume.  Ugh.  She hung up again.  No, she is.  Someone of favor.  She's right there.  Hang up.  Don't hang up.  Don't hang up.  Let it go.  Hang up.  Hang up.  It's cool.  I, for one, I'm sorry and I, for one, am a... 
[03:21:30]  I like the story that you're telling.  When you think about...  It is inspiring.  When you think about those days, are you cool with it or are you...  It's sensitive, sensitive.  I honestly don't think about those days, but if I do, I'm cool with it.  Do they get you downs?  No, they don't get me down at all.  Aroused?  No, they don't get me aroused.  They're just a part of my life that's over.  You giggle.  They do.  Yeah.  Yeah, anything else?  Regret the past.  They're downs in the dumps.  Yeah.  It's a good memory.  I don't regret anything.  I have no shame.  I have no guilt. 
[03:22:00]  It's awesome.  Do you miss your boobs?  Do you miss those?  I got to tell you something.  You had huge boobs.  I'm on your website, TonyPeaks.com.  It's not her website.  Tony.  My website.  Somebody else is exploiting her name now.  Did you get really big implants so people wouldn't look at your face?  No.  You're very rude.  That's Opie, by the way, Tony.  And Opie is a...  I'm going to say it.  A son of a bitch.  To our people.  I'm here trying to...  Hold the fort down.  To get a little information. 
[03:22:30]  I am fascinated with the story.  I find it inspiring.  And someone like Opie really can't appreciate somebody maybe struggling and then emerging  from it a better person.  And I apologize for that.  I think it's a fantastic picture.  That's actually a very beautiful picture.  Stronger, less...  I like that.  Mamoretical.  I like it.  You should learn how to use Photoshop for your family photos and for your past photos.  Anything else you're interested in as far as just being a mom?  Or is there anything else in your life that you're doing? 
[03:23:00]  I work in radio and television.  You do radio and TV?  Well, tell me a little bit about that.  What do you do?  I did tell...  I worked before I had my daughter.  I was working in a news station.  Oh, now.  Really?  Working at the assignment desk.  And I was also running the board for a satellite television on direct TV station, eight-hour  daily programming.  Oh, board op.  Yeah.  I was doing technical behind the scenes.  That's pretty impressive.  You were on the Maury Povich show and you were an intern.  You know how to fix phones for the... 
[03:23:30]  I wasn't an intern, you're correct, but I also had a pain without running a board after  I was done with my internship.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  See?  Hey, see.  She's doing things.  And now, uh...  Running a board.  She didn't say it was from Home Depot, though, did she?  Stop.  No, she was out of the business.  Hey.  She's trying to hold the whole thing together.  What was that?  Are you going to try to sue these guys and get, like, some of the rights to the photos  or at least get some of the website money back?  That'd be something.  No?  No?  You're fine with those being out there?  Now, being a mother, aren't you concerned that maybe your children will look on the web 
[03:24:00]  and see some of these pictures of you?  No, because when they're old enough, I'll have a talk with them about it, like I said.  Yeah.  I have no shame and I have no guilt, the bottom line.  Yeah.  I'm going to be opening up.  I just know how excited some children can get if they see things on the web like that.  Yeah.  You know, all of a sudden they're looking and, you know, they're...  Well, hopefully they're not going to be looking at areas like that.  There's a parental block that you can put on your computer.  Two of them are going to watch that and one of them is trying to eat the monitor.  Do you realize that you were known for your big, juicy tits and that's it? 
[03:24:30]  Um, I don't really care.  Yeah, that was a point in her life.  But that's it, though.  That was a point in her life.  That was a point in my life where that's what mattered, I guess.  And she's moved beyond it.  No longer that way.  She's moved beyond it.  It happens.  I mean, you do something, sometimes you're young and foolish.  I'm sure you have a few skeletons in your closet there, Opie.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He certainly does.  Touché.  Touché, Tony.  I'm sure there's a few big-headed skeletons in his closet.  I'm sure there are, and that's fine.  Actually, many.  Luckily, yours just aren't all over there on the web. 
[03:25:00]  Yep.  Absolutely.  She made a couple decisions that didn't work out the way she wanted, and she kind of said,  all right, that's not bad.  Tony, Opie should hold that fat tongue of his.  Exactly.  Tony, he's trying to get a little better than that bitch.  Tony, I like you.  You're feisty.  You fight back.  And you got me with that one.  I like her.  It's going to hurt all day.  That's true.  That's true.  Mwah.  Tony, thank you so much for coming back on the phone.  No worries.  I think we were able to take lemon and make lemonade out of it, because we got a little 
[03:25:30]  info, and I find your story fascinating, and I'd like to learn more about it.  I see a book or a movie.  Absolutely.  Oh, yes.  Definitely a book to start.  Yeah.  A young girl being enticed into the life of smut, let's say, having to deal with a disabled  child, and then emerging from this a better person with a family life.  And I think that's fascinating.  It is.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  As long as there's a lot of topless photos in the book. 
[03:26:00]  Jesus.  What a boring interview.  Mwah.  Move on.  You guys wouldn't be interested.  Again, I apologize, Tony, and I find it fascinating.  I honestly think it'd be a very interesting book, and I think that a lot of people who  have had decisions that they've made in their lives, they kind of wish that they didn't.  Like, you know, Tony, I went to that clinic and had that taken care of.  Tony, the first time.  Tony, no offense.  You're just not my cup of tea, and if this was my radio show, 30 seconds tops with you. 
[03:26:30]  Tops.  No worries.  I agree.  Tops.  But that's you.  That's you.  You don't find human drama that fascinating, Opie.  I tend to, you know, I find it fascinating.  Human drama is fascinating.  Things like her story, maybe off the top of my head, Scott Peterson, story like that,  I find it fascinating.  No, I wouldn't put those in the same category.  Well, it's human drama, wouldn't you say?  It's different panels.  Yeah, that's correct.  Human drama is over now. 
[03:27:00]  It's a guy that had a wife, and, you know, she was pregnant, and perhaps he foresaw some  type of disaster and decided, you know, he was going to take care of the problem.  Absolutely.  And, you know, that's more human drama.  That's a sad, sad story.  It certainly is.  Absolutely.  He should have definitely made sure he took that hair out of the boat, that silly goose.  I can't even believe you can poke fun at that.  We're not poking fun at it, but it's just like when you look at someone like a Susan Smith,  or as I call her, the problem solver. 
[03:27:30]  That's uncalled for.  It's a fascinating story.  Jimmy, Jimmy, uncalled for.  Enough.  All right, guys.  Well, I'm going to let you go.  All right, Tony.  Oh, great.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Tawny, thank you so much for checking in with us.  Goodbye, Tawny.  All right, you guys have a great day.  You, too.  Say hi to the kids.  And good morning and good afternoon, too.  Good morning, good night, good afternoon.  Good evening, whatever the hell that is.  Bye, Tawny.  All right.  Bye-bye, Tawny.  See ya.  Bye.  Bye.  Tawny Peeks.  Tawny.  Tawny. 
[03:28:00]  Tawny.  Yeah?  Tawny.  Tawny.  Tawny.  Tawny.  What?  Tawny.  Why haven't you hung up yet?  Oh, I thought we were off the air.  I didn't know if somebody wanted to talk to me after.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Tawny.  I'm the screener, actually.  We are off the air.  You had a good time with the interview.  They were just poking a little fun.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, did I not feel good about that one. 
[03:28:30]  I got to leave.  You got to go?  You're just not a good person.  No.  Photoshop the family photos.  That's the worst thing I've ever heard said on the show.  You're lying.  That's just one of your lines.  No, Photoshop the kids.  I don't say it to the person.  She was a retard.  See?  Retard.  See, I'm the boss.  Oh, he's still here.  Retard.  I forgot.  Curtis the gay black rapper is still in the studio.  Jesus.  Wow.  What did we do to deserve this today? 
[03:29:00]  You're a gay guy around here.  There is just...  All right, guys.  I got to go.  I got to go to the dentist.  Oh, there you go.  Stephen Piercy was going to tell his Aussie story before he left.  Can you wait five?  I'll listen to it in the car.  I got to go get my car.  I thought your appointment was later.  1030.  Oh, I thought it was 230.  230?  That's a good one.  230.  All right.  Nice meeting you.  All right.  Should we do here?  We'll take a break, and we'll wrap up this mess next.  Are you staying, Stephen?  I'm staying for a little bit, yeah.  Well, we only have 10 minutes left. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Let's go.  Let's hang.  We hit it off with Stephen Piercy.  Sure.  You live in New York or L.A.?  I should be living here.  It's more my speed, but I'm Los Angeles.  Well, next time you come to town, you stop by and say,  hi.  Without a doubt, man.  You don't have to call anyone.  Just knock on the door, right?  There you go.  Derek, get us out of here.  It was with them out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great. 
[03:30:00]  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  What a mess of a show today.  The O.P. and Anthony program. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, man.  Stephen Piercy in studio.  Yo.  O.P. used to do the thing with Rat.  He's getting ready to finish his book, it looks like.  Yeah, there's the book.  Oh, also, I have the single from Fuel or Drive with me is on NHRA ESPN2 all year long.  Look at you.  Yeah, I'm way involved in drag racing.  I'll have a car out sponsoring a top fuel funny car and dragster for Vegas.  Have you ever rode?  Soon enough.  Very dangerous nowadays sport.  If you're going to commit yourself to that, you better have your perspective. 
[03:31:00]  At that point, you might as well get yourself in a rocket and go straight up.  Yeah.  I mean, my buddy...  It seems safer.  Yeah.  My buddy Tony Schumacher holds top speed in the Army dragster at 333 at 447 seconds.  You're up to that fast now?  Yeah.  That's why I say to me to go in there, you know, and I've busted enough bones to know  that, you know...  Can't they throw you in one of those things and go 150 miles an hour?  I remember you...  Oh, I can go...  I've done 200 on the street myself. 
[03:31:30]  180.  I mean, you know, and race a little bit, but it's a whole different breed.  But the song's out there, and the video is actually being played on, you know, the program  ESPN2, too.  So we're very happy with that.  That's very, very cool.  Third year with them.  Good exposure, ESPN2.  Yeah, they're good.  They're good people.  I'm trying to just get that rock and roll development in there.  And you don't have to sell your implants to come on our show.  No.  That's a good thing.  Or my...  No, not...  That's a good thing.  Yes. 
[03:32:00]  And start the tour in May, the Fueller tour.  And the Fueller comes out, second solo CD, a month or two in a month, I believe.  Do you have your own website?  Yeah.  I have steven-piercy.com for my personal stuff.  If you want to know anything business, go to topfuelentertainment.com or topfuelrecords.com.  And it's all there.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Let's see.  We got Curtis the Gay Black Rapper, and we haven't been able to spend too much time with 
[03:32:30]  you.  You're going to come back, though, right?  It's not black.  I got you.  Huh?  Yeah.  I'm not black.  But he's not black.  Right.  He's...  I assume he's gay, but not black, and I assume you're a rapper, because I haven't heard any  of your stuff.  See that?  What does that mean?  See that?  See that?  Well, listen, you know what?  What?  I beat you with a stick, rob you for your shit, make you get up on your knees and suck  my head in his dick, nigga, what up.  All right.  He must have been strapped. 
[03:33:00]  I don't get in to see that.  I think he's really proud of his gayness.  Hell yeah.  Because here's a guy, you look at him, you can't tell he's gay or black.  No.  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You have a stereotype.  You got a little, you know...  So you can walk around and people just assume you're a straight white guy, which would make  your life a lot easier, but you have no problem making sure people know you're gay.  You're right.  So you're proud of your gayness.  But he probably hears a lot of...  Which is fine.  He probably hears a lot of gay and black jokes, because people just think he's some white guy. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, right.  So you hear a lot of stuff that probably...  I pass.  I play defense.  Yeah?  A lot of people may be in the same room, and they start telling an off-color joke about  black or gay, and you're standing there.  What are you thinking?  Hey, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  Well...  I hear you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Well, let's play one of your songs.  Yeah, let's do it.  Kurt Black, a.k.a.  Homo Thug, right?  Right.  What song you want us to play?  Play Gangsta.  Gangsta? 
[03:34:00]  Oh, you know what?  Play Dreams of fucking a famous rap star.  I talk about all the rappers.  Like, see 50 Cent right here?  Yeah.  I take that nigga 50 Cent.  I fuck that nigga 50 Cent in the back of a range.  And change his name to Dollar Bill, because I don't do small chain.  Say?  Hey, this is not going to be like a rap war outside the studio now that you're here.  You're going to start shooting outside?  There's not going to be other gay rappers coming to get a piece of your ass after this  interview, is there?  Oh, you guys ain't doing that.  All right.  All right. 
[03:34:30]  Here it is.  Biggie Smallest Head Dreams of fucking a R&B, bitch.  Little Kid Head Dreams of fucking a R&B, nigga.  50 Cent's Head Dreams of Robin and Instagram, nigga.  And Kurt Black is having a tune like a fucking famous rap star.  Yo, it's real drought, it's real drought.  I'm having dreams of fucking a famous rap star.  Then I was Escobar.  Yo, if I ruled the world, you could hate me now.  Yo, lock me up in jail and erase me now. 
[03:35:00]  Nigga, 50 Cent, yo.  Back in a little range.  Fuck his name, yo.  Because I don't do small chains.  Take the nigga Eminem.  Yo, what?  Uh?  Q-Tip make him sing in a red G-string.  Watch him shake his ding-a-ling.  That's a vibrant thing.  Grab an extra tube of lube when I'm with Ice Cube.  We'll be fucking all the way to next Friday, dude.  And that nigga Fat Joe, yo, I give him a blow.  Let him lick my asshole for half a kilo.  In the beat nuts, I'll leave him nuts to dick.  Because living is sick, everything from ass to feet.  Slip the dick, slick, rich, new dog, and Warren G. 
[03:35:30]  Snap the P in the no-limit family.  Make juvenile smile when I'm famous.  I'm having dreams of fucking a famous rap star.  Fuck the Dre got this new female rapper White Lady.  What the fuck's his name?  Yo, his name is Shady.  Faggot-ass niggas, only half of a man.  Cause Eminem smells in your mouth, not in your hand.  Then that nigga fuck daddy, snatch him out of hot wheels. 
[03:36:00]  Put that motherfucker up in a wig, a dressing heel.  Talk him to my bed, make him sit on my face.  Reminisce about the nights that he spent with me.  It's a hard knock life for Jay-Z, you see.  It's a hard cock life for a bitch like me.  Cause ain't no nigga got lips like you.  When you be tossing my salad, I be eating you too.  Who's next on the list of dreams?  Having sex gotta be that rough rider nigga DMX.  When you fuck yo, that shit out that bitch in Bali.  Want a raw dog nigga?  Fuck the KY Jelly.

Having dreams of fucking a famous rap star.  You know who you are, it's the itchy arm.  Having dreams of fucking a famous rap star.  Having dreams of fucking a famous rap star.  Should we be bobbing to this song like we are?  Bob your head to it.  Yeah.  We're all just bouncing. 
[03:37:00]  I don't know if this is the type of song we're supposed to be bouncing to.  There we go.  There you have it.  Wow.  Uh, alright. 
[03:37:30]  The vocals were very low on our mix that we had here.  So he was able to just sing along live like that.  Yeah.  Right there in the studio.  Kurt Black, aka Homo Thug.  Nice.  It's got a nice beat.  Opie and Anthony show.  What?  That was, uh...  It's got a nice beat.  I just looked around the room and we're all bobbing our heads.  I don't know if we should be bobbing to this song.  Yeah.  Yeah, suck his dick.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's sing along.  Wow.  Yeah, that's something, man. 
[03:38:00]  So what do you do with this?  Do you perform?  Do you just record?  Well, we do show.  I do shows, but I can't get a record deal.  No?  Try to get like a major record deal, but they won't.  They're puffy.  Nobody would sign it.  No, huh?  Why not?  Because rap sold the most in Texas and in the Midwest, and so they went, you know, they're  scared of it.  Scared of it?  Well, yeah.  All motherfuckers talk shit.  Hell, yeah.  That's kind of unique, you know?  You don't get many guys rapping about tossing salad and sucking dick and ass fucking. 
[03:38:30]  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'm commercial.  I have commercial tracks, but they don't sign it.  They're still scared of it.  They're like, oh, I do talk shit, but in jail, it's all right.  In jail, niggas can fuck niggas.  Yeah.  But then when you get out of jail, oh, back with the baby's mama.  Nah.  Ah, turncoat.  So they won't sign it.  You know how many gay rappers they're out?  Come on. 
[03:39:00]  You and Gangsta Fag.  I think there's two of you.  No, there's a bunch of them in the closet.  You know Gangsta Fag?  Yeah, I'm a Gangsta Fag, huh?  Yeah, you know him?  Oh, Gangsta Fag?  Gangsta Fag?  Oh, no.  You've never heard his shit?  No.  Joe Rogan turned us on to Gangsta Fag.  Gangsta Fag is hardcore.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you got competition, yo.  Oh, really?  This guy's West Coast.  We got a West Coast and East Coast.  You know what?  Get him in here and we'll battle.  Fuck Gangsta Fag.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's it.  That's good.  Two gay rappers battling.  Jesus.  Wow.  I smell pay-per-view. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  Damn.  I hear he's on his way to the studios here right now to kick you when you leave.  Let the fuck out of here.  He's going to kick you in the ass.  What?  He's going to bitch slap you as soon as you leave the studio today.  Oh!  Is he black?  I don't...  It sounds it.  He sounds, uh...  Yeah, he sounds like he's living...  But who knows now?  ...the thug life.  You know?  I fucking West Coast niggas.  You crazy.  It's the East Coast thing, son.  You want to hear a little of him?  Yeah, go ahead and play.  You should pop a little of him on it.  This is Gangsta Fag.  I don't know what song.  He wants it. 
[03:40:00]  He wants it.  West Coast.  I don't even like the D.I.  No.  No, huh?  Well, how's that West Coast sound, though?  Yeah.  See, I was getting high with my boys one day.  Just kicking back to the night of that lake.  When it's through, you're going to find this real fucking bass.  Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.  I think we're starting a rap war here.  Wow. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  A gay rap war.  Call the New York Post.  It's the gay version of 50 in the game.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yo, bring gang...  Yo, get Gangsta Fag, and then we'll battle.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  All right.  We don't even know where Gangsta Fag is.  I'm probably sucking a dick right now, according to his lyrics.  Guy's always looking for dick.  Somewhere on Sunset looking for dick, so...  Oh, man.  All right.  Yeah, that shit's whack, though?  Ah, whack.  Yeah?  He didn't even get to the hook, where he, like, picks up this straight guy, and then, like, 
[03:41:00]  he bangs him and wipes away, and then he wipes his dick on the kid's toy.  On the kid's toy.  He picks up some guy who's straight, but he wants to have, you know, gay sex and stuff.  So, uh, he takes him back to the house, and he's fucking him in the ass, and then he pulls  out and comes all over the sheets, and then wipes his dick on his kid's toy.  Pretty sick.  Whacked ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he's trying to go over the top a little bit.  Get the fuck out of here.  Bring him on.  Yeah.  I think it's whack.  Bring him on.  It's the East Coast thing. 
[03:41:30]  Sorry, bro.  LA ain't got shit on New York rappers.  Sorry.  Dr. Dre got fat beats, and that's it.  Yeah.  On that sense, but, eh.  It's the East Coast thing, bro.  Yeah?  We created it.  We started rap.  Really?  Yeah.  Well.  Sugar Hill Gang.  What do I say?  Sugar Hill Gang.  It goes back to the Sugar Hill, right?  Or are we talking to Curtis?  Yeah.  Curtis Blow?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Curtis, Sugar.  Back then, famous for all of them.  Is it true you wanted to be called Curtis Blow Me? 
[03:42:00]  Curtis Blow's the best.  Oh.  All right.  Well, that's some rap war we got going here now, Opie.  We're going to have to bring Curtis the Gay Black Rapper back into the studio.  Yeah, you got to bring me back.  Yeah.  We have just begun.  Did you want to know?  We ran out of time.  Yeah, we did run out of time, unfortunately.  I want to hear your back story, you know?  I mean background, not, you know.  Frosty the Blow, man.  What goes on? 
[03:42:30]  What's with the...  I like the voice.  That's pretty cool.  That's unique.  Yeah, I see that.  Not many people.  I don't even smoke.  See that?  You and Harvey Fierstein pretty much have that voice.  Pretty much it.  But he doesn't rap.  Nah.  But he is gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a big old queen.  He is a faggot.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a faggot.  Yeah.  Anthony, hold on to your hats.  Tomorrow on the program, Ben Bailey.  Yeah?  Wow.  We've got to promote this, huh?  Ben Bailey. 
[03:43:00]  Jesus.  Someone in Arkansas is going, who?  Who?  Someone in Arkansas, someone in this studio is going, who?  That's me.  Ben Bailey.  Yeah.  Who's actually very, very funny, New York comic, and a friend of Norton's and the gang,  and Lizzie Grubman.  Lizzie Grubman?  Will be calling the program.  Yes.  Your buddy?  Met her once at a little shindig.  She's fucking ugly.  Yeah.  She's fucking...  I mean, come on.  That's a beast. 
[03:43:30]  Like...  Hey, even straight guys think she's ugly.  Wow, yeah.  You know, that's...  You're not breaking any new ground there, Copernicus.  She's fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Kurt.  Sorry.  Sorry for what?  You did it good.  No, I mean, you know, but, you know.  I like your beats.  Those are pretty good.  Good stuff.  The lyrics are a little, you know.  A little crazy.  I wouldn't be blasting it out in my truck when I'm driving around, you know.  Nah.  People would be looking in going, ooh, what's going on in there? 
[03:44:00]  I play in Harlem, though.  Yeah?  I live in Harlem, so I play in Harlem.  Yeah?  We have our little brothers.  They probably dig it up there, right?  Yeah, come on.  Yeah, they all get down.  Yeah.  But they're not gay.  On the down-low?  Yeah, but they're not gay.  What's with that whole down-low thing?  Eh.  You think that's really going on?  Yeah.  A lot of the brothers, they're gay.  You know, they live a straight life, the chicks and everything, fathering kids and everything.  But then on the DL, they're having sex with other guys. 
[03:44:30]  Right.  And that's going on?  And then most of them want to get fucked.  Really?  The whole point is that they mess with a guy, but then they want to get fucked.  They want to be on the bottom.  Yeah, you're the bitch.  Wow.  That's something.  Who saw that coming?  Well.  All right, Anthony, I want to thank Scott Farrell for sitting in on the program today.  No, thanks, Curtis.  We'll have you on again.  Curtis the Gay Black Rapper.  And, of course, Steven Piercy. 
[03:45:00]  Who knew, man?  We'd hit it off.  You've got to come back.  That's great.  I appreciate it very much.  He appreciates our sense of humor.  Oh, yeah.  He was laughing harder than anyone during the Tawny Peaks thing.  This is good.  Yeah, that was interesting.  But pleasure, man.  Yeah.  The satellite radio, that's where it's at.  You get to do whatever you want.  You don't have to worry about censorship.  You can be honest, you know?  I mean, honesty is the best policy, you know, in reality.  You don't have to sit there and have the FCC...  Or pretend you're something you're not. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, Norton wanted to hear the Aussie story.  We've got a minute.  Oh, Aussie, yeah.  Norton's in his car going to go to his dentist.  Aussie, we called him Uncle Aussie.  We picked up the rat tour there, I mean, with Aussie in 1984, I believe.  After Squire did Europe, Canada, and America.  And this one time in Los Angeles, about four in the morning, I believe me and the old drummer  kind of walked Aussie to his room at about four, all jacked up, whatever, up on there.  And he saw these shoes, nice and pretty, sitting in the hall to get shined in the morning. 
[03:46:00]  Was it a good tour with Aussie?  Oh, it was brilliant.  Yeah.  You know, but back then, I mean, the poor guy was getting death threats left and right,  bomb threats.  People just, you know, it was when, oh, Aussie's the devil, right?  You know, everybody's pretty ignorant back then, too.  So, anyway, he sees these nice shoes.  Hold on one second, I've got to ask you.  Was he touring with his family at that point?  Yes, he was still with the kids.  Really?  Yeah, Jakey Lee, our buddy.  Jakey Lee used to be in Mickey Rad, his guitar player. 
[03:46:30]  So, it was brilliant.  We had our friend there, my old guitar player, but we were touring with us.  And Sharon, and Sharon, and the whole thing, Entourage.  It must have been a nice hotel if, uh...  Well, it's great, of course, you know, and we're, you know...  What was that place?  Because it was on...  It's in Los Angeles.  It's on Sunset.  It's the, uh...  So, the shoes are sitting there.  So, these nice, pretty...  Party is over!  Everybody go home!  This is the Beatty Comedy Show. </pre>
