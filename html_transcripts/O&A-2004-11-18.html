<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with music and a promotional announcement (“The Opie and Anthony show, spreading across America”).  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, began by discussing Anthony’s compulsive counting, joking about its similarity to OCD, and their surprisingly low-key personal relationship despite their long working partnership. They also commented on their similar outfits.  A substantial portion of the show focused on listener emails detailing graphic and humiliating fraternity and military hazing rituals, often involving forced nudity, exposure to unpleasant substances, and other degrading acts. The hosts discussed the potential for a gay subtext within these experiences and joked about needing to increase the show’s sex appeal due to a perceived lack of female callers.  A segment was mentioned about a competition to determine the "sexiest state" based on listener-submitted recordings of sexual activity.

Jim Norton’s complaints about his coffee fueled a recurring comedic bit throughout the show.  Listener feedback was addressed, including confusion over recurring in-jokes like "Monster Rain" and the "marshmallow" incident (referencing a previous, degrading fraternity hazing story shared by Opie). Opie recounted his own bizarre and humiliating fraternity hazing experiences, using vulgar and offensive language. The hosts also discussed an upcoming XM Satellite Radio device, a positive New York Post article about XM versus a competitor, and the continuation of their online stream.  Further listener calls detailed additional hazing stories, and a comedic news segment featuring Rob Reiner was played.

The show continued with numerous listener calls describing sorority hazing, ranging from body shaming to physical abuse. A bus driver ("Lobster") recounted a bizarre incident involving a naked woman on his bus.  Other topics included Al Franken’s interview with an unintelligible person, President Bush pardoning a turkey (contrasted with the realities of war), the universally disliked game of Monopoly, and the potential revival of their "homeless shopping spree" and creation of a new fundraising event called "Feels for Meals," which involved touching a naked woman in a box for charitable donations.  Comedic clips, including a poorly-received *Caddyshack 2* clip and a bad song, "Total Recalling," were played.  Scheduled guests Jeffrey Ross and Francine (a former intern, now stand-up comic) were mentioned. The show ended this segment with a discussion of past show bits and a caller's midget sighting anecdote.  Multiple callers shared violent and sexually explicit anecdotes.  Racial slurs and misogynistic comments were used throughout.

Francine, the former intern and stand-up comedian, appeared as a guest, playing a tape of her act. Her angry, observational humor targeted fat women and other life experiences.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Jeffrey Ross (also a guest) provided commentary and critiques, often interjecting with their own jokes. Francine’s act included jokes about fat women, her perceived ugliness, and observations about Spanish people. Jeffrey Ross recounted a near-altercation with a knife-wielding college student during a stand-up performance and detailed his recent hip injury from ice skating.  The hosts discussed XM Satellite Radio and took a few more listener calls. A Nas/Black Sabbath mashup was played, met with mixed reactions.  Numerous obscenities and offensive language were used.

A segment focused on a list of the "25 gayest moments in rock history," prompting discussions about musicians' perceived sexuality and on-stage antics.  The hosts and callers analyzed 80s music videos, noting the flamboyant attire and suggestive movements of hair bands and contrasting them with New Wave artists. Ozzy Osbourne's videos were repeatedly cited.  Musicians like Little Richard, David Bowie, Mick Ronson, Freddie Mercury, Boy George, Tattoo (a Russian duo), and Village People were discussed.  One host detailed his childhood experiences as a Village People fan, including unusual childhood fantasies involving Kiss.  A caller relayed a rumor about Jim Norton’s potential firing. Callers shared childhood memories and experiences related to music, including unusual behaviors and encounters. One caller recounted a police report about a sexually assaulted stripper.  Discussions of the hosts' childhoods and memories continued, and a caller described having sex while calling into the show.

A caller, Laurie, and her husband engaged in sexual activity while on the phone.  The hosts attempted to listen, but poor audio quality led to comedic frustration.  A caller, Paul, humorously commented on Texas being the "unsexiest state." The segment ended unsuccessfully due to audio issues.

This was followed by the song "Monster Rain," based on a listener-submitted story about Jim Norton's childhood sexual encounter. Several callers then shared experiences, including a mother finding her children playing "Monster Dark," a woman recounting childhood sexual activity with friends, and a caller describing listening to the show in class.

The show concluded with a discussion of *Caddyshack 2* (deemed terrible),  listener calls sharing their takeaways from the show (often vulgar and inappropriate), listener anecdotes ranging from childhood sexual experiences to observations on the hosts' personalities, and a brief news segment about Microsoft smartwatches. The show ended with the hosts chanting vulgar phrases and announcing the start of a "war."

[00:14:30]  No?  No  Ben loves to gossip  He comes running in here all giggly going  Ben is like a one man quilting bee  Well, here's what it was  We're all ragging on each other  Because we all dressed the same today  So I said  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  See, something has happened with Anthony and I  I don't know  I mean, we've been doing radio for 10 years  And once again, we came to work wearing very similar clothes  This is the third time it has happened  Yeah  We both broke out fleeces today 
[00:15:00]  It's my fleece?  And they're the exact same fleeces  I walk in and say hi and I just start laughing  Like, what are you doing?  Oops  Yeah, and that shows you something  Because I don't even notice those things  I have no clue what I have on  I look at you  You're wearing the same fleeces I'm wearing  I wouldn't have noticed all day long  But, you know  We're wearing the same thing  We're kind of like twins separated at birth at this point  I have a marshmallow up my ass  Also, oops  And then some guy  He's really pissed at me because I finished your sentences 
[00:15:30]  He goes, you weren't doing it for a while  But you're starting to finish Anthony's sentences again  Stop it  It's really annoying  And then, because that guy said that  I noticed I do do that  Really?

All of a sudden  Something is going to hit on this show  And you're going to join 
[00:23:30]  Little Jimmy and I  I seriously don't think I'm repressing anything  Because the Treefort story is really good  But, you know  You didn't do anything  You didn't do anything  And then you just had to fall asleep  And make believe you were snoring  That's easy  If he was a real young go-getter  He would have, you know  That's right  Just turned you over  Not paying attention to my fake snoring  We've got to clear these lines  Thinking about  Yeah, get rid of everybody  I really don't care if the Boneyard guy is still at it 
[00:24:00]  I really don't  Is it a bit now?  Go back and forth  Now it's your turn, Opie  Uh-oh  That's probably a bit  Probably want some attention on a show  That's actually getting a lot of people listening  T-Bone writes Anthony in the email  My fraternity brothers made us drive down  A Pat's Cheese Steaks in Philly  Oh, that's harsh  I beg guys to, you know  To come forward and admit that  They did some weird crap  Share  So you're not the only one in the barrel  So this guy had to go down 
[00:24:30]  At Pat's Cheese Steaks in Philly  To pick up steaks  And a large cup full of their  Patented jalapeno-infused hot sauce  Well, that doesn't sound that bad  Alright  When we arrived back at the house  With the steaks  The brothers had us go down  In the basement  It's always in the basement, by the way  Where they made us drop trow  And lay on the floor  Asses up all in a row  They proceeded to walk down the row  Pouring this hot sauce down our ass cracks  Gravity took over  And the sauce ended up all over our junk  We then had to pull up our pants up 
[00:25:00]  Pull up our pants up  And do miscellaneous calisthenics  Like squat thrusts  And jumping jacks for 15 minutes  But it seemed like a fucking eternity  They finally let us go  And the ten of us rushed back to the dorm rooms  To take showers and burn our underwear  Instead of relief  It felt like someone had taken a blowtorch  To our junk  Because that opened up the skin pores  Horrific experience  Also on our hell night  All the brothers had eaten bags and bags of shrooms 
[00:25:30]  And were going out of their minds  Trying to make our lives miserable  Hallucinogenics were banned from all hell nights thereafter  And I've been trying to put that night  Out of my mind for years  Thanks for bringing this crap up again  Opie  Alright  That's one  That's really bad  There's a million of them  I don't know how gay that is though  Hot sauce on the crack is pretty funny  Make you pull your pants up and exercise  I don't know  That's pretty funny  Dude it's  It's  It's the whole theme  Is this  Getting a room full of naked guys  The whole theme of being naked  In front of another guy 
[00:26:00]  And then doing stuff to his ass crack  And what do you mean  You don't know if it's gay  Hot sauce down the crack  And then pull your pants up  And go exercise  I don't know  I'll give you funny  Alright here you go  You don't think it's gay  I will find a person to come in here  And do that  I don't care what it takes  I think we're going to be giving out  My fives in the near future  And we'll get you hot sauce  And you do it  I don't want to do it  He doesn't want to do it  Doesn't mean it's not funny  No I don't mean  You'll pour the hot sauce  I know what you mean  I don't want to do that either 
[00:26:30]  Why not  Maybe I'll help towel them off  Why not  Because  Because it's weird and it's gay  Weird yeah  I don't want to see a guy's open crack  Use his ass as a little dip bowl  Maybe later  Give me one of those poppers  Alright  Mike from Massachusetts  Here's two quick hazing stories  Straight from Full Metal Jacket  I went to the Coast Guard Academy  Which was I guess  Some brutal hazing  Alright  The violent story  The guy in charge of us  Found a glass jar of peanuts  In someone's bunk  Just like Sergeant Hartman 
[00:27:00]  He held it up and shouted  Peanuts  What the fuck are peanuts  Doing in someone's bunk  He then smashed the jar on the floor  And made us do a shit load of push ups  On the broken glass  We got cut up beyond belief  Alright  And now he writes  This is the gay story  20 of us were piled into a 12 by 12 shower room  To clean up  That in itself was gay enough  We had to share nozzles with two other people  Oh  But to top it all off  One night he made us all get on the floor of the shower  And start banging out push ups  We were all buried under ass  Dick  Feet  And heads  Oh see 
[00:27:30]  Now you're a wet group of men  In contact with each other  In the shower  That's uh  Who would make guys do this  And uh  It's the guys  The guys that are doing it are bad enough  But they want to be in this fraternity or something  So bad for some reason  That they do it  But the guys that are making the guys do it  Those are the ones that you gotta question  You gotta question their sexuality  Because you volunteered to do that  To be like on the pledge committee 
[00:28:00]  Yeah  Like after I got in  I didn't want anything to do with any of that stuff  So I just kinda  You know  And why would you come up with these ideas like that  Oh they go back man  They go back to the whenever  The 50s  The 40s  This is tradition  That's the weird part  It's not like every year  You know a fraternity or one of these military  Oh they don't come up with new stuff  I don't  I guess maybe here and there  But in general  It's stuff they've been doing for decades  So it's like Voss's act  So somewhere along the line 
[00:28:30]  You know  Some  Some fraternity was really really gay  That must have been it  Right  Somewhere down the line  Somewhere down the line  It was really really gay  And they just did it  Year after year  After year  After year  This guy Rusty Trombone  He wrote me a five page email  Jesus  And I just  I just highlighted the  The more interesting parts  I mean this guy is traumatized to this day  Swears he's you know  He's straight as an arrow  Married  Has kids and all that 
[00:29:00]  But it still affects him  But I guess I brought up a memory yesterday  Because that has always been in the back of my mind  It's like  Why did we have to do this weird  Yeah  Homoerotic crap  To get into a manly institution  Alright  So this guy writes  Alright we enter the room  Where lineups took place  And Pink Floyd's  Welcome to the Machine was playing  Alright Anthony  The first thing we did after the song finished  Was strip naked again  Stripping naked  And the Pledge Master 
[00:29:30]  Would take a candle  One by one  To each of us  To illuminate our junk  To see  Whose was the biggest  Oh I thought  When you said  Took a candle to us  That kind of got scary for a minute  I guess the room was really dark  Everyone was naked  I thought you meant he did something  With the candle  And the Pledge Master  Takes the candle  To take a gander  At everyone's junk  It's very dark  As everyone's lined up  Right  To see who was the biggest  Big boys got wows  Small boys got belly laughs 
[00:30:00]  So you mean  If they see  They see a big one  They would comment on it  Everyone would be like  Wow  And then they hold the candle up  And you see a wee little winky  Yeah  Yeah  Oh  How degrading  Yeah exactly  So the belly laughs  They made us then  Put our clothes back on  And the whole house  Then proceeded to empty  The contents of our kitchen  Onto us while we  Did push-ups 
[00:30:30]  Tomato sauce  Garlic  Olive oil  You name it  It was on us  This went on for hours  The whole night  While doing push-ups  Sit-ups  Etc  Okay  Then later on  In this email  We did the old  Naked  Pick up a grape  In my ass  And drop it  Into the bowl  Bit  Eh  It's not a marshmallow  They were using grapes  Grapes are a little tougher  I think marshmallows  Have a self-adhering  Quality to them  Where you wouldn't have to  Really get a good grip on it  But a grape  Oof  See you know  With a marshmallow  You don't really have to commit  Yeah  You don't have to commit  As much with a marshmallow 
[00:31:00]  If you think about it  Kind of sit on it  I guess  This kind of  Whatever  With a freaking grape  You have to commit  To get that thing  Lift that thing  Up hands free  Okay  And the next day  We all had a big bowl  Of grapes  First one  Who got three in the bowl  Won a brownie  They won a brownie  Must have been a pot brownie  Or something  The rest did push-ups again  That being done  The event of the evening  Was a naked obstacle course  Around the house 
[00:31:30]  Oh  The two things I remembered most  Was one stage  Where we had to recite the creed  While three brothers hurled  Drenched wads of TP at us  The second to last stage  Was at the top floor  Where before us on the ground  Laid a picture of a naked centerfold  On the brothers orders of  Fuck the pussy  We got down on the ground  And dry humped the paper  Until they told us to stop  About ten minutes later  We realized what that mysterious substance  Was on the paper  That was covering our genitals  Tabasco and Icy Hot  Holy S  Huh 
[00:32:00]  And then it goes on  I mean this thing is really long  But I'm almost done actually  Day four of Hell Week  I guess this is Anthony  Here's where it really got messed up  We were kept away from our basement  Where the lineups took place the whole day  10 p.m. at night  In our changing room  On the second floor  Our pledge master came in  And told us to  Get naked  Get naked  And close our eyes  And follow them downstairs  So we do this  Getting naked at this point  Was no big deal for us  We head toward the basement  Single file  And enter the lineup room 
[00:32:30]  Which was like 40 feet by 10 feet  As we walk in  I noticed we were entering  About three inches of water  I opened my eyes  And every brother in the house  Was in the room  Butt naked  Laying on their backs  With their legs up  Over their heads  Giving us a view of  60 balloon knots  What the F  I want to go on record  I didn't do anything  I mean I told you  The worst thing I had to do  Yeah  This stuff is bizarre  The room had become a bathtub  60 funky treasures  The room had become a bathtub  Because of the water 
[00:33:00]  They had on the floor  Right  And then all the brothers  Were yelling  Psych!  Whatever that means  They were 60 guys  Drinking naked  Playing slip and slide  Across the basement floor  Which was now  A 40 by 10 bathtub  Holy ass  Let me repeat that  60 guys naked in a basement  Converted to a bathtub  Playing slip and slide  And drinking beer  Nothing sexual going on  But still freaky  Nothing sexual going on  Other than the little glances  That's enough  One of the brothers told me  That there are pictures  In our vault 
[00:33:30]  Of brothers doing this  Back in the 1950s  Exactly what we were just saying  Oh really?  Could you imagine guys  With buzz cuts  And Mickey Mantle posters  On their wall  Doing this in 1953  Oh yes  Needless to say  I'm still disturbed by this  Blah blah blah  And then he signs  It's still straight  As an arrow  And married  How awful is that?  Leave the water running  In the whites only fountain  Yeah  Get it all flooded  Down there  Sure  Back in the old days 
[00:34:00]  What else did they do  In the 50s?  Alright good  Go touch a negro  Just go pat the elbow  Of a negro  And run back  I did it  John in Jersey  What's going on?  Hey Opie  I want to ask you  Once you got on a fraternity  What you had to do  To the pledges  I couldn't be bothered  I just said that  I mean you had  You volunteered  To kind of mess  With the pledges  I couldn't be bothered  That's the  God's honest truth  Because then I started  Hanging out at the bar  I was DJing at  With like all the  Bartenders and stuff  You were never involved 
[00:34:30]  In any hazing  After you got in?  Not really no  Not at all  Well I was  The worst I did  I was a runner  Back then  So I would take  The pledges  On runs  That was it  Like  Hap  Hap  Hap  Hap  That was it  Those kind of runs  Yeah I wasn't going to do  Any of the  Homo erotic crap  Oh you had a little  Marine Corps jogging  Did you?  Oh yeah I did  One two three four  Open your assholes  And lay on the floor  Fugly what's up? 
[00:35:00]  Hey how you doing?  Pretty good  What's going on?  I got two stories for you  When I was  Pratt about 20 years ago  The first one we used to do  Was called the elephant walk  The elephant walk  Yes  Yeah that's based  Where they got all the  Pledges down on their  Their hands and knees  Would take masking tape  And put it between your nose  And your brother's asshole  And you all had to walk in a line  And if anyone broke the tape  They would take the tape off  Cut it in half 
[00:35:30]  And shorten the distance  Between your nose  And the guy in front of you  Is asshole  And this was through  Build teamwork  Build teamwork  Yeah  That would  Wow  That would work  That does work though  Go slow  You betcha  You certainly don't want  To break that tape  Wow  That's pretty funny  Cut it in half  Know what the problem  With the elephant walk is?  You find out which guy is gay  Yeah  Oops  Oops  I can't help myself  My tape broke 
[00:36:00]  My tape broke  Mario what happened?  I don't know  You've been doing this  After about an hour  Of doing calisthenics  And sweating your ass off  And believe me  You did not want your nose  To these guys butt cracked  Oh that is hilarious  The second thing  They used to do to us  We had a second floor  Land  When they'd do the line up  And they'd get all the  Pledges down  And have them  Spread their butt cheeks  To the air  And the guys would  Stand up top with eggs  And bomb your assholes 
[00:36:30]  Then pour flour on you  And make what they used to call  Pledge pancakes  Pledge pancakes  Yeah but the whole idea  Was to try to have  The best aim  And get the egg to break  Falling two stories  Right in your asshole  Oh my god  Alright thank you Fugly  Take care guys  Alright  Yeah right on  Let's say hi to Joker  In South Carolina  Joker  Hey what's going on  O&A  What's up  Hi  Listen I've got a

[00:37:30]  And then the cop  The chief of the boat  This big fat fucker  Was sitting in a chair  Like King Neptune  We had to crawl across  The garbage  And he was  We were blindfolded  Crawl across his junk  And lick jelly  Out of his belly button  Oh my god  That's not true  Yes it is  Joker  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman  Would never make you do that  Wow  That's how you became  A shellback  When you crossed the equator  In a submarine 
[00:38:00]  Yeah isn't that the  It's so weird  This stuff  But that didn't make him  Gay did it  No I don't  No no no  Licking jelly out of  Another man's belly button  With your underwear  Pulled between your ass cheeks  Of course not  How do you think  I got this gig  Alright Joker  Thank you  Alright cool  Let's go to Joe  In Jersey  Let's go Joe  Bunch of men  In a submarine  For months on end  I think we might  Have to start a new rule  Yeah  We don't go to the phones  Until 630  Give everyone a chance  To have their first  Cup of coffee  You notice how  Everyone's just  Slightly slow 
[00:38:30]  That first half hour  Of the show  Joe what's going on  Guys how you doing  Alright  Listen I've been  A fan since you guys  Came over to New York  And you're sitting here  Talking about the fraternities  You know  Listening to your show  It's just like a fraternity  The way you guys  Haze your guests  You're kind of right  I mean I told my old  My old fraternity brothers  That I  You know  Being in that frat  Definitely influenced  Some of the way  I do radio  Except for the  We don't do the  Homo erotic crap  Unless it's Norton 
[00:39:00]  Bringing in rent boys  But  There you go  Yeah I know  Well we're going to  We're going to take  The gay out of the show  Hopefully today  Yeah  That's a good start  I mean  You know  Chance Rush  From Fairfield California  And it brings up  A great point  That I never thought about  The frats  Are Greek  And look at the  Ancient Greek customs  You're right  Very gay  You know  They like the  Naked wrestling  And stuff  And you know  What Greek means  If you speak Greek 
[00:39:30]  Right  Yes  The ass sex  So perhaps  They've carried that over  To the whole Greek thing  With the fraternities  And you've got to be  A bunch of naked guys  In order to get in  Let's go to Dave  In PA  What's up Dave  Yeah I was on the  Battleship Iowa  In the Navy  Yeah  And I wanted to  Corroborate that  Other guy's story  When we had to do  The shellback thing  We crossed the equator  We crawled through  All that garbage  And we got to the chief  At the end  He had lard smeared  All over his belly 
[00:40:00]  And we had to  Pick a cherry  Out of his belly button  See that guy's  Got to be gay  Who  I mean  How does he  Volunteer for that  Like yeah  I'll be the guy  With the lard  All over my belly  And stuff in my  Belly button  They get a big kick  Out of it  I mean it's a big deal  I guess the shellback  Tradition has been  Since the Navy started  Right  And yeah  The chiefs say  They get a real big kick  And the shellbacks  Are already on the ship  They get their jollies  By beating people  In the ass 
[00:40:30]  With pieces  Of cut up fire hose  That's crazy  One queer  Probably started that  In like 1850  And they couldn't  Get rid of the tradition  How about maybe  They could pick up  On the tail hook thing  And then rape everyone  As the submarine crosses  God almighty  How irritating is that  Alright well  We're going to step aside  And continue with  The Opie and Anthony show  As we go to break  A lot of people  Are requesting clips  From How's Your News  That we did about  I don't know  Maybe two three weeks ago  Oh yes  Just really quickly 
[00:41:00]  I want to play  The Rob Reiner one  Where the  Rob Reiner has to sing  With this retard  Yeah it's a bunch of retards  That do the news  Right  They've made their own  Little news show  And one retard  They got an interview  With Rob Reiner  And I'm sure Rob  Loved being called  Meathead  Yeah  Check this out  Festival director  Hi this is Ronnie Simonson  Today I'm interviewing  The Meathead  All in the family  And of course  We're here to sing  That sing song  And today  Boy the way Glenn

[00:42:00]  For California  This guy's a champ  Lucky girl  Oh god 
[00:42:30]  I need a towel  Yeah  I need a towel  Come on  They're applauding  From the other booth too  Thumbs up  Stop  Jesus Christ  Think you can do better  Call Opie and Anthony  Live at 866-WOW-1-WOW  And give it your best shot  How big does that thing get?  They're on the right side  What time is it?  Big Ten Today time  I can't hear you 
[00:43:00]  Big Ten Today time  One more time  Big Ten Today time  On XM Satellite Radio  It's Thursday  November 18th  2004  I'm Maggie Linton  With the Big Ten Today  Big Ten  Saturday will be  The final game  For many Penn State Seniors  When they host Michigan State  They're the first class  Under Coach Joe Paterno's tenure  Not to go to a bowl game  Despite a record  Of three and seven  The coach is proud  Of his senior leaders  And I appreciate them so much  Because they have stuck with us 
[00:43:30]  Sometimes you get some guys  That you get to a point  Where they're disillusioned  And disappointed  And they quit on you  These guys have worked hard  And have been good examples  For our underclass  And that's why I'm so optimistic  About where our program is  I can't go  The Nittany Lions won  Their first conference game  Last weekend  They'll be hoping for more  It's the Spartans  At Penn State  Beginning at noon eastern  On Big Ten Channel 186  Another team hoping to bounce back  Is Northwestern  The Wildcats were mauled  By Michigan 42-20 
[00:44:00]  And host Illinois  On Saturday  Coach Randy Walker  Thinks his team  Will come ready to play  Yeah I've always been pleased  With this football team  And their ability  To bounce back  And we certainly  Have to do that  So I'm really looking  Forward to this game  It's a rivalry week  It's a trophy game  All the things that go into it  And I think our kids  Will be ready to bounce back  And play our best football  This week  On the other side  Of the ball  Will be Illinois  Illini coach Ron Turner  Says it's more than  Just the trophy  And the win  That drives many  Of his players  Our guys 
[00:44:30]  A lot of them  Are from the Chicago area  They know a lot of the guys  On their team  And it definitely  Is a rivalry  No question about it  Regardless of someone  Playing for a ball game  Which they are  If they're playing for a possibility  Of a ball game  Or not  I think both teams  Will be motivated  I think both teams  Will be excited about playing  Catch all the action  With Illinois at Northwestern  On Big Ten Channel 187  At noon on Saturday  And that's the Big Ten Today  On XM Satellite Radio  I think very often  College acts  Don't give their very best  Shock to colleges  And I remember  I played  A college up in New England 
[00:45:00]  With the electric flag  Bowdoin College  About 2,500  Fairly conservative students  Nice guys  Homecoming  Whatever  The deans were there  And in the middle  Of the concert  Mike Bloomfield  Is on the guitar  Goes  Holy man  This sound system  Sucks man  Just a minute man  It sucks  You get us a new  Sound system  We'll wait  Okay man  It says sucks  And the dean goes  We'll see what we can do  One two  One two  Your ass man  It's very nice  Of the flag  To a music  I played a lot of 
[00:45:30]  Unusual school  I played the Air Force  Academy  Last spring  And a lot of people  Are snotty about it  Oh it must have been  Something  They were very nice  They were a good audience  They want to be like  Other college students  They were very orderly  And they were very attentive  And I remember  At the concert  Prepare to laugh  The dumb shit 
[00:46:00]  You see on the news  Like these women  Newscasters  That want to go  Into men's locker rooms  I mean look at  What they're making  An issue out of  These ugly fucking dogs  That's what  That prick fucking look  Is  That's what they do  They look at prick  They went to school  For ten years  So they had the license  To walk into a locker room  And look at prick  Right  Did you see the one  That said they molested her  Or something 
[00:46:30]  Did you ever see anything  So fucking ugly  In your life  So she's pissed off  She spent thousands of bucks  Now she can't even  Look at prick  Dumb prick looker  Fucking bitch  Bastard  There's more important  Things in this world  Than prick looking  That's what I think  It's the O&A virus  XM 202  XM news  Talk  Sports  And information 
[00:47:00]  It's everything  All the time  Don't look confused  Jim  The two tribes  Have gone to war  Frankie goes to Hollywood  What's wrong  I can't hear the music 
[00:47:30]  I couldn't hear the opening music  So maybe it's just my head  Oh really  Yeah  Nice article on  O&A in the New York Post today  Really showing that  XM Satellite Radio  Is definitely  The better company  By far  Yes  And the place to be  Can they find like a  Current picture of you and I though  My god  How old was that one  Maybe three years ago  Three 
[00:48:00]  Yeah  They kind of just compare  XM Satellite Radio  With the little doggy company  And it's very obvious  That XM Satellite Radio  Just kicks their ass  On all levels  So  Don't want to bore you  With the details  They show like  They do show the hardware  And it doesn't even compare  They show the little doggies  Like fish finders  And then they show our  Sleek new  MyFi  That's right  MyFi  Which pretty much is what  The Walkman type device  You don't even want to say Walkman  It's more like an iPod 
[00:48:30]  Yeah  You know  You can listen to  XM Satellite Radio  While you're walking around  You know  Completely portable  Completely portable  Not some adaptation  Of some huge unit  That you got to carry around  A big battery pack with  When is that coming out  By the way  Is that in the month  Very soon  Yeah  I think within the next week  Or two  Just a time for Christmas  Yeah so  It's going to just  It's going to sell out  It's going to be unbelievable  They're going to have to  Make more already  But can you  You can listen live  And you can download  Like if I want to download  A show and listen live  You can do both 
[00:49:00]  You have both options  Yeah  Yeah  Cool I definitely  Yeah so  Let's say you're  You're going on a plane  And you want to listen  To the Opie and Anthony show  Or whatever  So you just  You dock it in your computer  Tell it what to download  It'll download all the  All the  You know  The show or whatever  Some of the music channels  And then while you're doing  Your cross country flight  Or what have you  You can be listening to  XM satellite radio  It's amazing  And the little doggy company  Doesn't have anything  Close to that  They're well over a year behind  In that technology alone  Rumor has it 
[00:49:30]  They're going to be  Giving away some  Some of their hardware today  Uh oh  I hope they're also  Giving away wheelbarrows  So the people could  Bring it home  Wheelbarrows and hand trucks  Hand trucks  Oh gee  Gee thanks for this  Piece of junk  Loading it in  That thing is just  An infernal machine  You see those  Unit  The one they showed  In the paper  Like this big  Boxy thing  Yeah  Well the funny thing is  It's ridiculous  We know for a fact  You know  XM has just 
[00:50:00]  Their technology department  Is just unbelievable  And then what happens  Is the little doggy company  They take the hardware  They have to take it apart  Figure out how to do it right  And it takes them  You know  A good year  To catch up  And then by that point  XM satellite radio  Is already moving on  To the next generation  Of cool stuff  It's not even close  Yeah when XM  Puts something out  They're already looking  At the future  And what that's  Going to evolve into  I know this is radio  But is that their  Boombox  Yeah  Holy S 
[00:50:30]  I swear to you  That's not a boombox  It's a  What is that  You know what it looks like  It looks like the radio  That you have to blow up  In video games  You know the ones  That are sitting on the desk  And you walk in  And have to hit it  With a crowbar or something  Or shoot it  That's what they look like  It's got a big dial on it  Wow  Big executioner's dial  He's dialed a voltage up  When I saw this picture  In the New York Post today  I thought that was a joke  I know  It looks like  The first speaker you ever got 
[00:51:00]  Remember the first  Wooden speaker you got  Oh yeah  That was  I don't want to exaggerate this  But it looks  Maybe  Eight inches high  And maybe a foot wide  That's  They're bragging over that  I know  Well there you go  But you can read about it  In the New York Post today  Page 50  It's in like the Pulse section  Just proving that  XM Satellite Radio  Is the way to go  You guys already know that  Because you got your  XM Satellite Radio  And you're listening to  Opium Anthony on high voltage  So don't have to spend  Too much time on that  Right Anthony  Absolutely

[00:53:00]  People have no idea  I mean we're talking  To the converted  The people that are  Listening to this right now  They get it  You know  The challenge  And it shouldn't even  Be a challenge anymore  Is to tell your friends  You have no idea  What you're paying for  That's like somebody  Saying I'm not paying  For TV  Absolutely  Because they'd rather  Just put the rabbit ears  Up on their television  And get the basic  Channels that you get  You're not paying for TV  You're paying for something  A lot more than TV  And you're paying for  More than just radio  I was reading an email  Some guy had his antenna  Stolen so he had to  Go back to regular radio 
[00:53:30]  He can't believe it  He's like  Why didn't I do this  You know  Two, three years ago  When it first started  Because it's so hard  You have to go back  To regular radio  After you've done this  Right  As soon as you show  Someone what this is about  People are like  Where do I start paying  It's just unbelievable  But anyway  Alright  This guy has a great idea  He's in New York City  It's Twin Man  What's up Twin Man  Come on guys  How are you buddy  Hi  I'm excellent  Excellent  Sucking traffic  On the throwaway  Oh that blows  Listen  In an effort to make this  Show more good

[00:55:00]  That's probably  Just put in  You know corny women  Or put an egg on the spoon  Run girls  Whoever drops  Just to pick the eggs up  Ha ha ha ha  Oh you're probably  They stink  You are probably right  There's no hot sauce  In the box  Or anything you really  Want to hear about  Put a book on your head  And see if you can  Walk straight  Across the room  And if not  You have to pick it up  And read a chapter  The egg thing  Would be great  If the girl had  Ovary cancer  And it was her last egg  Yeah I got ovary cancer

[00:56:30]  And showing it on your screen  And the navigator  Then altering your course  So you can go around  The traffic  I understand Sirius  Has the same thing  Like if a vehicle  Has had their Sirius radio  Fall onto the highway  While the crews  Are doing clean up  And people are going around it  They'll tell you  Where the traffic is  Yeah there's a story  In the paper  About a frozen turkey  Going through a windshield  And critically injuring  This woman  But at first  They weren't sure  If it was a frozen turkey

Good morning  I used to be a bus driver  With New York City 
[01:02:30]  Transit Authority  And this is kind of  A hazing thing  From one of the  Sororities  I used to drive the bus  On Myrtle Avenue  In Brooklyn  To B-54  Which goes over  Near Pratt  And I had this  Gorgeous  I mean drop dead  Gorgeous black girl  Made Halle Berry  Looked like a slouch  And she got on the bus  About 1 o'clock  In the morning  She had nothing  But a pair of  Black high heels on  And a token  She paid her fare  Sat down  Never flinched 
[01:03:00]  Got off the bus  Down at J Street  Scampered down  Into the subway  And you know  It had to be  Something to do  With a sorority  Prank there  At Pratt  She was just  Naked on your bus?  Oh my god  Absolutely  Don't you think  She was  She was straight faced  And everything  And you had to know  At the beginning  Of the school year  It had to be  Some kind of  A sorority prank  Wow  Nice  We want to hear  From  She was absolutely  Gorgeous  Cool  Thank you Lobster  We definitely want to  Hear from the ladies  Though  Yeah it's a little 
[01:03:30]  Different when  Guys tell the stories  We're getting an email  Evil G from Jersey  My girlfriend pledged  For a sorority  And one thing they did  Was they would  Circle everything  That was wrong  With the girl's body  I guess  And then if the face  If it was on their face  They would have to  Leave it on for  Three days  So the girls would  You know  Criticize the other  Girl's body  That sounds more like  What girls would do  To each other  Exactly  Taunt them  For their big hips 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  Hey cottage cheese butt  O-T-E-E-E  Not me  Corn balls  Wonder why you make  Awful comedians  Matt from Wisconsin  Hey this is  Love the show guys  There was  In Chicago  There was these girls  And it was a high school  Soccer game  Basically  Seniors versus juniors  Or underclassmen  And they beat the  Holy fuck  Out of these girls  At the end of the game  Oh yeah  We all saw that video  Calling the piss  Out of me

[01:05:00]  Walking out  We were talking about  Caddyshack 2 the other day  We got  Remember we were talking about  How awful Dan Aykroyd  Was in that movie  The whole movie was awful  It's the worst sequel  Ever made  To one of the  Funniest movies  Ever made  Right  Well we got like  Three really bad clips  From that movie  I laughed through that movie  I thought Caddyshack 2  Was good actually  Shut up  Oh you are such a liar  No one's buying that today  There is not one laugh  In that movie  Not one laugh  Aykroyd was funny  Playing like the  Wacky groundskeeper  I thought he was great  Oh yeah yeah  No one's buying it

[01:06:30]  That's true  So one of them got  To Al Franken  And it's the retard  That doesn't even make  Any sense whatsoever  Can I say something  Like you can't even  Understand what he's saying  Yes Jimmy  I don't know why  They're all  Democrats  As opposed to  I mean Republicans  Are against abortion  And if you're going to abort something  Let's be honest  We know where you're going to start  I don't know why  For practical reasons  Right you would want Republicans  In there so you have more company  Absolutely  At these little homes  And outings that they do  Sure  Well listen to this exchange 
[01:07:00]  With Al Franken  Al Franken  Very very uncomfortable  Doesn't know what to say  To this guy  And he's trying to be  Politically correct  You know I didn't understand that  I'm sorry  All righty  Yeah I'm Al Franken  And I'm covering this convention

[01:20:00]  Secret  Message  Secret messages  What secrets  Nothing  I don't like secrets  Go for it  Generoso  Go for it  Little Sammy secret teller  Yeah  Call in the troops  Yes  I'm looking  Generoso  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  I want to be in the loop  I don't like being  Out of the secret loop  Isn't that horrible  All secrets are  Eventually revealed  On the Opie and Anthony show  But I like secrets  Don't you worry 
[01:20:30]  All secrets will be  Oh  Oh I see it right here  Revealed  Yes  Yes  Okay  Maybe not now  For reasons we don't  Want to talk about  But all secrets  Will be revealed  On the Opie and Anthony show  Eventually  But I like  I like knowing secrets  It makes people  Want to listen  But  Then I won't tell you  My secret  Oh  Maybe tomorrow  I'll have to listen  Tomorrow  All right  So President Bush  Anthony I'm sorry  Yeah  Every year  The President of the United States  What does he do  He pardons the Thanksgiving turkey 
[01:21:00]  And you know  When you're in war  Doesn't it seem a little off  And maybe they should skip the tradition  It's a little odd  That there's a president  Who  Whether you agree  Or disagree  He is sending  People  To a place  To fight and die  Yep  He's sending  Young men and women  To be  To be killed  You know  Some of them will be killed  And  What do you think 
[01:21:30]  The families feel  When they see him  On TV  Hardening  A turkey  Letting a turkey live  He's sending  You know  People  You know  I know most people  Would say  Yeah you can't really  Make the connections  But it's just  It's one of those things  That kind of sticks out  When you see him  Smiling with the turkey  I will let you live  And there are people  Like being killed  In a war  I think the president  Should be all business  Around now  No funny  Little fun and games  Pardoning the turkey 
[01:22:00]  You should put a turban on it  And then kill it  There you go  Slid its throat  That'd be a little better  Should slit its throat  Right on TV  Cut its turkey head off  Yeah  What happens to these things  Too afterwards  I'm sure it's a big  I think it's an attraction  I'm sure it's a big  Tourist attraction  Somewhere in Washington  It's like here's the turkey  That was pardoned  By the president  Oh let's look  Oh my god  There's the famous turkey  Let's get a picture  With the famous turkey  Oh there he is  Wow there he is  Looks just like he did  On TV  Oh wait a minute 
[01:22:30]  It does say  Let's see  President Bush  Officially pardons  Biscuits  That's his name  It's Lil Biscuits  Aww  The national Thanksgiving turkey  In the Rose Garden yesterday  Biscuits will live out  The rest of his days  At a Virginia petting zoo  See you're right  Safe from side dishes  And official ceremonies  That's just bad  It's not cute  It's not funny 
[01:23:00]  It's  Well they've been doing it  It's one of those stupid things  The president does  Year after year after year  But you know  Anthony makes a good point  We're at war  You should just like  Drop the whole turkey thing  Drop the turkey thing  No one's gonna miss it  Drop the Easter egg hunt  On the White House lawn  All those fun and games things  Get to business  How come all that corny stuff  Gets picked up as tradition  How about a few  Of Clinton's activities  Those would be fine traditions  Yeah  Here's a cigar  It's now a tradition 
[01:23:30]  Congratulations  You're now in the sorority  All the faggy stuff  That you hate  But the great stuff  Everybody just kind of ignores  It's Montecristo day  Look lit end first  To all you  You're gonna have to  Pick up the cigar  Without using your hands  And bring it over  To the president  Yeah  You make a good point  Obviously  The light hearted stuff  Should really go away  During the time of war  Yeah we've just come off 
[01:24:00]  A pretty painful week  As far as casualties go  And there he is  Know what he should do  Thank God he let the turkey live  He should pardon a soldier  Hey there you go  For Thanksgiving  For Thanksgiving  One that thinks he's gonna be gone  The whole time  One of these guys  That is in the middle of Fallujah  Gets the letter  The president has pardoned you  You could go home  Have Thanksgiving with your family  Time served  That's a nice one  You are done  You're done  Done with your tour  Time served  Now wouldn't that be nice  How about that as a tradition  Not a turkey 
[01:24:30]  They could put the turkey in camo  And send him over there  Little gun under his wing  Gobble gobble  Giving away the position  There they are  It was a  She was a turkey  Shut that turkey up  Let's go to Philly  And say hi to Steve  Hey Steve what's up  Hey  What's up  I just got a question for you  You guys gonna be doing  A homeless shopping spree this year  Since you're back on radio  You know what  You bring up a good point 
[01:25:00]  That I've been meaning to talk about  For a while now  Here's the deal  The old Opie and Anthony show  We were on in close to 20 cities  At our highest point  And most of those cities  Were concentrated on the east coast  We had a massive following  In New York  Philly, Washington, Boston  And other places  Rub it in  Especially New York  We had well over a million listeners  Just in New York alone  It's gonna be tough  To do a lot of those  Traditional Opie and Anthony bits  Until the audience grows  So I don't know  If we should do 
[01:25:30]  The homeless shopping spree this year  I really don't know  Because we have a big audience  But the problem is  It's now spread out  All over the country  It's not concentrated  In New York  Where you can just casually  Last minute  Tell people to go to a mall  And thousands of people show up  I just don't know  If that's gonna happen  And your boys  Don't wanna look stupid  We never wanna look stupid  So if we do the homeless shopping spree  And only ten people show up  We're gonna look like idiots  Well it's kinda cool  Just to have the homeless there though  Yeah that's true  It's one of those things  That really  I think the people showing up for it 
[01:26:00]  Was an extra added feature  Yeah but Anthony  We never intended on that  Last time we did it  There was like 5,000 people  That showed up at the mall  At the last minute  But we never planned on that  I know but that  No I know  But that makes for some  Just great radio  Oh yeah  We have 5,000 of our lunatic listeners  Following homeless guys around  As they shop for Christmas  Well it helps with the confusion too  Because if they just see  A bunch of homeless guys  They might shut stores  When you got all these thousands  Of people going every direction  It's kinda hard to get a hold on  Well maybe we do it  And we just kinda change the bit  A little bit  And you know 
[01:26:30]  I mean if you wanna show up  And you have the XM satellite radio  That's great  But maybe we should lower  The expectations  Cause I mean  Part of it was just  The mob mentality  That came about  Because of it  I mean it was unbelievable  It would pull it's gates down  In front of the homeless people  The whole crowd  Would just start chanting  Let them shop  Let them shop  And it was  For the new listeners  It's an unbelievable bit  That we used to do  I'm sure OAVirus.com  Will maybe list the old  Homeless shopping sprees online  So you can check them out  But basically we got  The worst homeless people 
[01:27:00]  That we could find in New York  That smelled  Haven't showered in years  And just  I mean just raging alcoholics  And we dragged them to the malls  And then  We gave them money  To spend on whatever they wanted  And then the listeners felt bad  So they were taking  Like cash out of their pockets  Like oh my god  And then these guys  Would take off their shoes  And their socks and stuff  And their toes would be a mess  And they're trying on new  Like Nike sneakers and stuff  I'll tell you something  The video that they showed  At the Hammerstein  Before the show started 
[01:27:30]  Was like a montage clip  Of our show  Yeah  And they showed  Tippy Tom  And I'd never seen this clip  Tippy Tom  At a shoe store  He took his shoes  And socks off  Could be the most disgusting thing  I've ever seen  In my life  And I'm serious here  It was his decrepit  Rotting toes  They were rotting off his feet  Yeah  And there he is  Like took his socks off  And he starts picking  At these sores  And everyone's like  Oh  On his feet  Yeah  Oh god  He has the hiv  And he's HIV positive 
[01:28:00]  Tippy Tom  Oh you're positive  Yeah  He is  He's got AIDS  Does he  Yeah yeah yeah  Remember that  He's HIV positive  Oh that's right  I got AIDS  Didn't he used to say that  No one dies of AIDS  He used to say  Yeah  Oh he's still living  Who knew that Ziggy  Would go before Tippy Tom  Ah you kind of  Figured that out too  We lost to Zigmeister  Tony  What's going on  A real surprise there  Yeah  What's up  Hey Tony  What's happening guys  What's up  No hey listen  I was at the  Short Hills Mall that day  It was awesome 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  You had to see  All the Jew  The old Jew ladies  Scattering when them guys  Entered the mall  We pretty much  The old Jew ladies  We pretty much  We pretty much  Take over the mall  When we do this  Yeah  What are you saying  It was like walking  Into a house  Putting on the lights  And seeing all the  Cockroaches running  It was hysterical  Are you saying  A Jew broad prejudice  Against homeless people  In it's day and age  I'm trying to bang  This broad Henry  Well they're used to  The more affluid people  Up in that area  If you know what I mean  Right  Alright  Alright guys 
[01:29:00]  Well you know  We got to figure it out  We got to figure it out  See if it makes sense  Maybe painting the star  David's on their businesses  And Juden underneath  Perhaps that was the problem  Yeah  That's why they were fleeing  Breaking their windows  Yeah  And someone's asking  If we do the homeless  Shopping spree  Will it be live on the radio  Yes it will  Maybe that's a day  We just go and do  An afternoon drive show  Like election coverage  Yeah we'll figure it out  Yeah just turn on  Alright listen  Know what bid I want to do  What 
[01:29:30]  The feels for meals  Now  Can we even do that  On satellite radio  I don't know  This would have been  The biggest promotion  The biggest money making  Charity event ever  We've been turned down  For so many charity events  All we want to do is help  Especially around the holidays  And we came up with an idea  Called feels for meals  To feed the homeless  And hungry around the holidays  What  What a  What a noble  Act  Yeah  I mean if  If XM satellite radio  Allows us to do this 
[01:30:00]  We will raise so much money  It's not even funny  The line would be  All the way down  I mean  Around the block  And you could charge  A lot of money  It would continue  Into Central Park  I believe  The line would go on  For hours  Screw the guy  Santa holding the bell  Next to the pot  Right  The concept was very easy  We get a really big  Refrigerator box  Uh huh  And inside is a naked girl  And then in the front of the box  Is two holes that are cut out  Yep  And you  As the giving soul  Yep 
[01:30:30]  You walk up to the box  You hand over your money  Or your canned goods  For the homeless  And then you reach your hands  In the box  And give a squeeze  And you  You cop a little feel  If you wanna  If you wanna give a little rub  On the sides of the boobs  If you wanna grab them  From underneath  And give them the little  You know  Feel the weight of them  Feel like  Bob up and down  If you wanna  Brush your index fingers  Over the nipple area  If you wanna circle  The entire breast  With all five fingers  It's like you're tuning in Tokyo 
[01:31:00]  Ooh  Tell me more  Any type of feel  You wanna do  You pop your hands in  You do that  Who wouldn't wanna be part of this  Right  And we're helping  We're helping  Big time  But I guess the company  We used to work for  Thought it was prostitution  Happening  The money is going to  But it's not prostitution  The strip clubs prostitution  When you put a dollar  In between their breasts  They're not prostitution  You can't feel them though  You can't feel them here either  You're just putting your hands  Through the copper field  On the side  No one sees what goes on in there 
[01:31:30]  Right  I will tell you why  It's not prostitution  Because technically  Breasts are not a sexual organ  Anthony  Ah there you go  It's like touching their shoulders  Good point  Good point  Did you know that?  No but I'm thinking  There should also be  A hole in the bottom  You know if you really  Donate a lot  You have to put your meal  A lot of money  A lot of money  A lot of money  A glory hole  Should we try to get  That going again?  I say yes  We need a girl  A couple of girls  And you know what  Oh yeah we need  A couple of boxes  See that promotion's easy  Because we'll just  We'll set up right on the street  Because the girl's not naked 
[01:32:00]  And the business guys  Walking by  We'll have signs  Feels for meals  Give up your money  And then do it  Paint the box up  All decorative and festive  And holiday like  Maybe like a big gift  So someone has to ask  A lawyer lady  If we can do this  You have one box  With the holes cut in the top  And then one with the holes  Cut in the bottom  Not to touch the front  But just have her  You can rub her ass  Perfectly  Oh really?  Perfectly allowed  In a strip club  There's nothing  Plus you're not having sex  You're not using insertion  Hey look I got a marshmallow  What do you think? 
[01:32:30]  I like it and think  We should do it  Alright  We need at least two though  Yeah  Do you think Taylor would do it?  I hope so  Because I'm pumping  A lot of money  With those new implants  She would be perfect  Oh dude  Perfect for this  You thinking implants?  Well you know  Implants are better seen  Than felt  Better seen than felt  I'll tell you something  If you remember  We wanted to do it  With two boxes  Yeah  We had the implant box  Oh and the natural box  And the natural box 
[01:33:00]  Nice  Yes  And then the ass  Remember the ass one  We have to have an ass one  Look at you  He's so fixated on the ass  That's where we're going  To get in trouble  People like the boobs  Heini  Heini's totally innocent  Oh someone had  Reached their hand in there  And tried to take her out  Like a bowling ball  You know it  You know it  That's the one  I want to do  And I want to do it  Next week  It's got to be  Big natural boob girl  Yeah big  Something natural  So when you go in there  For the grab  You can feel the weight  Alright well 
[01:33:30]  We got five girls  Listening to the program  At this point  So maybe one of them  Just happens to  To meet your criteria  Maybe one fifth  Of our girl listening audience  Would like to participate in this  So we got to figure that out  To see if we can do that  Next week  That would be the one  That would work  For the holidays  Do you think the XM lawyers  Are pulling their hair out  Right now yelling no  In slow motion  Probably  I don't think  I think that you can do it  I don't see why you can't  We didn't either  It's not prostitute  But the Infinity lawyers 
[01:34:00]  Found quite a few reasons  Why we couldn't  Yeah but that might be  More FCC stuff too  They're worried about  They might have said  It was this  But worried about that  I think we can do it  Alright we'll find  We don't need to ask  Just do it  We'll find out  Phil from New York  Morgan's fine with it  Hey  What's going on  Go ahead  Go ahead  How about we put  Jimmy in a box  We can have a  It's our box  With Jimmy  And Phil is not  You know it's funny  As you were saying  That I was thinking  How great it would be  If I stood in the box  And they squeezed my titties  And didn't know it was me  Oh these are nice  You know we love it Jimmy  They're so feminine 
[01:34:30]  If you let listeners  Squeeze my fat man tits  You'd probably make  A lot of money  Not even in a gay way  But just because  They want to hurt me  Okay  Well we'll throw that  On the table today  We'll see if we can  Get that to happen  Yeah  We had a request  For Total Recalling  Total Recalling  We'll play that  Going into break  I see an old friend  Outside the studio  Wants to come in  And say hi  Jeffrey Ross  Love the Jeffrey Ross  And also Francine's  Out there  Was he at the  Last roast we went to  The Donald Trump roast 
[01:35:00]  Yes he was  I wasn't even able to tell  Yeah  I didn't have my  High powered telescope  I didn't have the  Hubble telescope  Photographed from the  Seats that Boss  Had gotten us  Boss' seats were very good  I mean you know  The sixth floor  Is a perfect viewpoint  I mean we could have  Probably watched the  Rose people coming  Up that way better  But we watched them  Going down Elm  I think we need to  Become better friends  With Jeffrey Ross  So we get better seats  At these roasts  Yeah  That's my goal  That's a good idea  That's my goal  Screw  Screw Voss  You can't hop on  Voss's connections  In show business  There are none  I can get you 
[01:35:30]  Dave Mortale's autograph  Voss is a boob  He's got nothing  Jeffrey Ross though  That was the biggest  Voss was going to get  And that's the best  He could do for his pals  Yeah  That was sad  Do you want to  Explain total recalling  To the new folks out there  I don't know where  This song came from  Or who does it  But it's a little  Arnold ditty  It's so awful  We love it  I don't know  It is  That's what makes it  So funny  Is the bad horrific singing  And off key singing  And the words  Are kind of funny

[01:45:00]  Was to surprise her  Just have her walk around  And jump out from a tree  And kind of grab her  Or something  No she was aware  That she was going  To be chased  Yeah  You know we set  These lunatics loose  She's got the flags  Like you have in flag football  She runs around  First person that  Grabs a flag off Erin  Wins a fine prize  Maybe a my fi  That we're going to  Be giving away soon  Here on the  Open Anthony show  Yeah they didn't like that  And the bee jar  The bee jar  Has to happen  We wanted to do a  But this now gets  Back into fraternity  Hazing sounding stuff 
[01:45:30]  Doesn't it  Yeah that's true  Lettuce  Yeah we wanted to  Take a jar  And put a bee in it  And have maybe  Six guys  We actually  Were going to do this  They gave us a car  To give away  I forgot the car  Oh it was an Aztec  Aztec  So yeah  We were going to get  Four or five guys  With like mayonnaise jars  Place a bee  In each of the jars  And then the first guy  That got stung  On his junk  Won the car  Then they'd have to  Stick their junk  In the jar  And hold it there  And the first guy  To get stung 
[01:46:00]  Won the car  We were so close  To doing that one  And then they shut us down  Maybe we can get  I was watching  A documentary recently  We'd have to get  An Escalade for this one though  On Japanese hornets  They're probably  Two inches long  And we have like  A three inch wingspan  If anyone's ever seen  They're the worst  Creatures alive  And if you could get  Them in a jar  You'd have to give away  At least a $40 or $50  And they sting  Repeatedly  And they attack  Other hornet nests  And they murder them  And steal from other bees  I mean they're awful  Do they wear bling  No 
[01:46:30]  They do  Yeah they're actually  H-O  Top apostrophe nets  Honets  Honets  Honets  But the  The lawyers shut us down  On that one  I wonder why  Well they were worried  About an allergic reaction  Allergic reaction  This is where you belong fellas  This is awesome  Satellite radio  Well whatever it is  It's radio  And you know  You can do whatever  The fuck you want  That's it  And it's kind of liberating  Curse  Is this the first time  You've been on a satellite radio show  Darn 
[01:47:00]  Yeah  You showed him  I can't  It's funny  We're used to it now  But when the old guys  Come by the new show  For the first time  It's funny to watch them  They're like  You really  You can really curse  You can get on mic  And it kind of  I'm not going to curse  Just on principle  That's good  I never thought you should be fired  So I'm going to pretend  We're still  Thank you  Thank you Jeffrey Ross  Pretend we're still back  Where we are  You lucky  Wait man  I got the  See wait  We have something  You're supposed to  You're supposed to warn us 
[01:47:30]  Oh no no  That's not it  That's the wrong one  Hold on  Hold on  Uh oh  Read  Warning  Warning  C word alert  C word alert  Warning  Warning  Because we found out  That the women  Really don't like that word  No  That is truly  The atomic bomb  We try to give the warning  Before we let that one fly  But there you go  Yeah you let it  I remember  During my lovely marriage  Opie  In my nine years of marriage  My ex-wife  That word  Was the single worst thing 
[01:48:00]  You could ever say  Ever ever ever  She would shut down  To her  Or just in general  In general  I mean in general  No  To her  Not even an option  And there was  A couple of times  Toward the end  Of the marriage  Where she would be  Bitching at me  For something  Are you going to say it  And I would  Yeah  Warning  Warning  C word alert  C word alert  Warning  Warning  She would be  Bitching at me  For something  And I would  I would try to gauge 
[01:48:30]  How loud I could say it  So that I felt like  A tough guy saying it  But she wouldn't hear it  Because I'd be like  Keep bragging  You fucking cunt  And  And there was one time  She was like  I heard  What  What  Came in  And was  Just unloaded  Now you know why  Just unloaded  Now you know why  The homeless were wearing  All your clothes  I know  Hey come on  They're in a guy  That's been married  That doesn't  At least think the word  You say it all the time 
[01:49:00]  This is why they hate it  Because they know  You mean it  When you say it  There's never like  I was only saying that  Like well you're kind of  You know what I mean  There's no way  To get around  It's not like bitch  Which is like  You know some girls  Enjoy being a bitch  Yeah I'm a bitch  And I'm proud of it  100% Italian bitch  Waka waka  You know chicks  Don't wear the shirt  They should wear  Maybe it'll  Maybe it'll  Let's desensitize it  So it becomes like D.Va  You think  Because D.Va  Eventually on VH1  It'll be like  VH1  Cunts  Sorry I missed the warning

[01:50:30]  Leave with one  Yeah  Who then got fired  One of the girls  Got fired  She's back  Is she back?  Yeah  I saw her at the Halloween party  She's like  It's not me  I'm not going to let some old man  Tell me who the fuck  And I was like  I was like  Alright  Well I guess not  Because you're back  Why'd she get fired  After leaving  For fooling around with somebody  Yeah  She's supposed to be in Hef's coffin  By 2am  There's the Hef  You know  He's got the image  So he's supposed to have these girls 
[01:51:00]  It looks bad  If some of Hef's girls  Are peeling off  To be with Rob Schneider  Oh you mean  It was one of his personal seven  Yeah  Yeah  You know  We had seven girlfriends  One to put it in  And the other six  To move them around  Seven  I had a great time  At that roast  You know  And we had the good seats  Like I said  Great seats  So where'd you sit  For the Trump roast  Why weren't you on the date  Where was the roast  What hotel was that  The Hilton  Yeah we were at the Sheridan  Did you see that  Did you see the big screen  Yeah  For the people that were 
[01:51:30]  In the back of the floor  That weren't close enough  To the stage  So they would turn around  To see what's going on  On the big screen  You were behind that  Behind the screen  Behind the screen  Yeah  No  No joke  We were right on the corner  Of that screen  Yeah  Wow  Oh yeah  It's the kind of pull  A Rich Voss has  And he was so excited  He's like  Don't blow it off  These tickets are $500 a piece  $500 a piece  He paid nothing  Of course  Forget it  He did great that night  He made me  I was proud of him  He did  He did a good job  He was very  There were a couple of people  Who just killed  And then there were people 
[01:52:00]  That just ate it  I kind of was in between  I was a little off  You are probably  One of the best people  At a roast  I've ever seen  Well thanks  You come there prepared  You got a lot of funny stuff  And I don't know  What happened that day  I was a little off  You were good  It wasn't like you ate it  Right  You didn't come out  In a nun costume  You know I came out  With a bad attitude  Which I usually can overcome  But I was just sort of  You did  I was off  Yeah  I don't know  That room was weird though  Why  It took forever  To get started too 
[01:52:30]  The god damn introduction  To the dais  Was forever  Freddie Roman goes up  And introduces like  50 non-speaking  B celebrities  Yeah  And Katie Couric  And like three other people  Yeah  Yeah  So that took forever  They finally get to the roast  You're like  Enough already  Stewie Stone was very funny  I've never seen him  Do anything before  Oh he's great  Yeah  All the guys on it  Were great  That was the one thing  But I don't know  Has anyone  By the time I got on  All the Trump hair jokes  Were shot  That's another thing  Trump  You have your set jokes 
[01:53:00]  And everyone pretty much  Does them  So the earlier  The better I guess  Dude Robert Klein  I think he's a brilliant comedian  He's one of my favorite comedians  Growing up  He was an influence  And he just  He had a tough night  He had a bad set  Yeah  Yeah  That was really rough  He was doing his act  He panicked  Some of these guys  Were just doing their act  And that's like  What happened to Carl  Who was the guy  That was doing his act  Oh my god  Norm Crosby  Norm Crosby  He was  I don't remember him being there  He would seg into just his jokes  You know  Donald Trump  Donald Trump's built a lot of buildings  And there's a construction worker 
[01:53:30]  And he gets into an elevator  And there's a difference  Like he's going up  To try to get gigs  From a Trump marina  Right  Right  I'm going up  To try to make you guys laugh  Four months later  When I see you  Yeah  You don't give a crap  I love that  Yeah  What's Trump  Has anyone ever  Has anyone ever come close  To punch you in the face  Penny Marshall  Penny Marshall  Really  Interestingly enough  She was angry  And I was a little afraid of her  Because she's a fucking crazy  Yeah  What did you say about her  That pissed her off  I guess it was the Rob Reiner roast 
[01:54:00]  She was married to Rob Reiner  And I said  How do you even want to roast Rob Reiner  I mean  How do you even make fun of a guy  That married Penny Marshall  That's a great line  How do you  You know  What was your wedding song  How much is that doggy in the window  Oh boy  And then like  A couple months later  I was roasting the Maloofs  The Maloof brothers  Who own the palms  And the basketball team  The Kings  Yeah  We're in Vegas  And she's a big basketball fan  So she's there  But she's like all coked up  And heckling me  And she's like  Fuck him  He's not a nice 
[01:54:30]  Don't put him on  Blah blah blah  And like  You know  They flew me in  And I'm  You know  There  I'm roasting  I'm doing this roast  And as I get to the mic  Before I even start  She's like  Shout me down  Not trying to be funny  Is she on the dais  No  She's like in the front row  In the front row  With Vince Neil  And they're both all wasted  And she's already gone up  And like humiliated everybody in the room  Including herself  Yeah  She bomb  Yeah  She was horrible  She did these like  Like hateful jokes  Where she made all the blondes  In the room stand up  And like  You fuck Gavin Maloof  You fuck George Maloof  And this and that 
[01:55:00]  And then I go up  And she starts heckling me  And I was like  What were you  Lenny or Squiggy  Oh shit  Shut up  Yeah that's good  And then they wouldn't let me go to the  Interestingly enough  It was like a little after reception  And they said  Well maybe  I guess she's a high roller there  A little more star power  They definitely pushed me out a little bit  Wow  And they wouldn't let you go to the thing  Well they sort of  Ushered me somewhere else  Yeah  Was there ever a line  You just  Wow  Didn't want to do  And you knew you had to do it  Like you were just freaking going  Oh god  I can't believe I'm about to say this 
[01:55:30]  Yeah there was one of the Trump roasts  That I let go  Which one  I said  I said you know  About all the women  He's banged  All the hot young  I was like  He's the only guy I ever met  Who's probably banged 72 virgins  Without having to blow himself up  In the name of Allah  And I was like  This is not going to get a laugh  It's going to get a groan  But I really want to read it  In the paper tomorrow  Yeah  That's all you care about  It's a great joke man  I want my line in the New York Post  Exactly  And it was in there somewhere  So I was happy  Even Voss made the paper  A couple times yeah 
[01:56:00]  He's famous now  I know  We did the Jay Moore roast  On NBC together  Oh that's right  Yeah  He was part of the last comic stand  You were part of one of the episodes  That aired  That's great  I was on like the third to last  Me and Triumph guest star  On the third to last episode  Yes  Is he really like that in person?  Triumph?  Is he really a sock?  I've had enough of that fucking sock  To be honest with you  I like that  Any guy that can hide behind a podium  And not actually face someone  When they're shitting on them  I mean I do not respect that  As a comedian  We have to look people in the eyes 
[01:56:30]  Yeah you know  I'd rather put a puppet on my hand  And go wacky wacky  And then put a little dog thing in there  I make poop  Oh you cut it out  Get him out of here  He's incorrigible  Oh fuck yourself  He's got eight nipples  And six jokes  Why do you hate him so much?  I don't hate him  I think a lot of the jokes are great  But I watched him trash Rickles one time  And it just  It really made me want to bite his face  You're thinking of Lisa Lampanelli  That's Triumph the Insult Moose  Another secret message Anthony 
[01:57:00]  JC, Mike, go  I don't like secrets  He's giving out secret messages  They'll all be revealed someday  Hey you guys want to get Francine in here?

Let's just throw it  Whatever you want to do  Anything goes  The ozone midget sighting of the day  Wow who saw this coming?  Chris in Jersey  What's going on? 
[01:57:30]  Hey guys  I got a midget sighting for you  Alright let's hear it  I had a hernia operation  Yeah  Somebody screwed up  They put me under anesthesia  And just as I'm about to go under  In walks a friggin midget  With a damn surgical cap and gown on  And the stupid little stethoscope  Dangling between her knees  Reaching up for syringes  That might have been the anesthesia  Yeah  You're saying your surgeon was a midget  I don't know that she was  The actual surgeon that cut me  But that was the last thing you saw 
[01:58:00]  Before you conked out  That was just about the last thing I remember  You sure it wasn't some doctor  That brought his kid on like  Bring your daughter to work day?  That just scares me  That somebody has to stand on phone books  To be able to slice me open and fix me  I don't think they use phone books there  In the ER  You should be grateful  Yeah maybe a stool  But do you want those little fat fingers  Suchering things in your heart?  No  Clumsy fat hands  Alright  Well thanks Chris  Cocktail drinks and a needling bread

Yeah  I think they reopened it  But I usually do like real shows  Real shows?  Ooh  You mean you go in there and say  I would like a spot and  No they make you bring like ten people  And then you can do a show  Ah  That old shag  I remember that from the old band days  You gotta bring some people man  Yep  That used to be how your radio show was  At the old place  You had to bring ten people 
[02:00:00]  Bring ten people  At the beginning  That's true  I got ten people listening  Can I come on?  Now it's like superstar  And uh  Describe your act  Um  Are you a cross between  Someone that's out there ready  Or  Doing your own thing  What's the deal?

[02:05:30]  I thought it was  Cindy Brady  Oh my  I'm really sorry  Jim  What  What would you do  To that guy  If he said that  While you were on stage  Is she from  The Brady Show  The Brady Show  That's what it was called  The Brady Bunch  Yeah  He thinks you sound  Like Cindy Brady  I don't remember  Watching that show  That's what  You would say  Back to him  If he said this  From the crowd  Like you're going to  Need some chops  Because people  Are going to go after you  What would you say 
[02:06:00]  What would you say  He would yell out  Wow you sound  Just like Cindy Brady  I'd say  I don't know  Who she is  I hate it  When people talk  During my set  That's way to  Hit back hard  That's right  That'll shut him up  Take it easy on him  Francine  I'm sure he'll have  Nothing else to say  After that  Wow  That's right sir  Point one finger  And three are  Pointing back at you  Alright  Three  What is your  I don't like to  Make fun of people  A lot  Okay  You're right  I'm an ass  I don't even know  How many fingers

[02:19:30]  .  Well, let's hear it for Francine.  She did a good job.  Thanks, guys.  We were ready to trash you, but, you know, we've got to stay honest on the show.  It wasn't that bad.  Not at all.  You kept it tight, which is always good.  Yeah, we'll look forward to another tape from you down the road, okay?  Thanks, guys.  Hopefully, you'll do something we can really mock and hurt you with.  Where's your next open mic?  Want to plug it?  Open mic?  Well, wherever you're...  I'll probably...  Today's Thursday? 
[02:20:00]  Yes.  Or wherever you're performing.  Oh, I think I'm going to be at stand-up on December 3rd.  What was that?  Oh.  The end of the Brady Bunch.  There we go.  And we're hanging with Jeffrey Ross.  We're going to take a break.  Jeffrey Ross is at Caroline's.  A lot of shows.  For tickets, 212-757-4100.  As we go on a break, Anthony, a mash-up here.  Give us a little break to eat cereal and stuff, okay?  What is it?  Beastie Boys and the Beverly Hills Coffee.  Where's the other mash-up you guys have? 
[02:20:30]  Which one?  I don't know.  This one here, it says Nas and Black Sabbath.  Oh, boy.  I'm just curious.  It goes on forever, though.  What song is it?  Ben, you want to ride this and when it starts really sucking, just go to break?  I don't know, but there's some buck buck in it.  Yeah, it's like six minutes long.  Oh, what song is it?  It's Black Sabbath and...  No, we'll just turn it off when you're done.  War Pigs.  Yeah, Ben will figure it out when it sucks, right?  Oh, you're not a big fan of War Pigs?  I love War Pigs, but I mean, it's like I've heard it.  It's like it's still in heaven for me.  I've heard it so many times. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, gotcha.  It's not that great.  It's a great song, but it's just...  This mashup isn't that great.  Oh, then don't play it.  Oh, by the way, by the way, I've seen your act, Jim.  Love it.  And you goof at one point at somebody rhyming something.  And if it's the same word you're rhyming with the word that it rhymes with, and it's the same word, that's bad, isn't it?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Unless it's in War Pigs.  Unless it's War Pigs.  Masses and masses.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  It's the same word.  But no, no, no, no.  What happened to your genius there?  First of all, those are not the original War Pig lyrics.  The original War Pig lyrics were far different, and they had a priest being burned in a fire, and they were forced to change, I believe, by Warner Brothers.  So those might have been the last minute lyrics.  Oh, he's actually got some.  That's great.  And I'm him.  And masses and masses, we understand why.  You know, it used to be cast the priest into the fire, and I think Warner Brothers was like, eh, eh, not on this record.  Well, who knew?  There you are.  There's the explanation.  Son of a bitch has an answer for it.  We'll try this. 
[02:22:00]  I don't think it's that great.  Ben will ride it when it sucks.  He'll get us out, and we'll continue with Jeffrey Ross.  Stay there.  Generals gathered in their masses  Just like witches at black masses 
[02:22:30]  Evil minds that plot destruction  Sorcerer of death's construction  In the fields, the bodies burning  As the war machine keeps turning  Death and hatred to mankind  Poisoning their brainwashed minds 
[02:23:00]  For larger  Now let's get it all in perspective  For all y'all enjoy me  The song y'all can step with  Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice  But I ain't 5-0  Y'all know it's Nas, yo  Green goose and a whole lot of hydro  Only describe us as soldier survivors  Stay laced in the best  Well-dressed with finesse  In the white tee  Looking for white feet  Thug girl who fly and talk so nicely 
[02:23:30]  Put her in the coupe  So she can feel the nice breeze  We can drive through the city no doubt  But don't say my car's topless  Say the titties is out  Newness, here's the anthem  Put your hand up that you shoot with  Count your loot with  Push the full stick in your new crib  Same thing that you hook with  Swing around like you stupid  King of the town  Yeah, I've been that  You know I click-clack  Where you and your men's at?

[02:24:30]  Lit up the reefer  Truck of the car  We got the street sweeper  Don't start none  Won't be none  No reason for your mans to panic  You don't wanna see no ambulances  Knock on pimp straight down  In this pimp cup  That's the way you hit Timberland up  Let the music diffuse all attention  Ball up convention  Free admission  Hustlers, dealers, and killers  Kamoon Swift  Girls, get close  You can feel where the tools kept  All my just comin'  Homies, parolees  Get money  Leave the beef alone slowly 
[02:25:00]  Get out my face  You people so pony  Pull out my waist  The eagle, 440  They shootin'  Ah, I made you look  You a slave to a page in my rhyme book  Getting big money  Playboy, your time's up  Where them gangsters  Where them dimes at?

[02:28:30]  And he got right into it.  We looked at each other and went, oh yeah, okay.  And this is another song I thought would get wrong.  Here are one-on-one interviews and performances before a live audience.  I just cut the dish.  Another exclusive music original presentation from XM Satellite Radio.  XM's Artist Confidential.  Hello?  Hi.  Patrick?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Richard here with Capital.  How you doing today?  What's up, bitch?  What's that?  I said, what's up, bitch?  It's out rich, actually.  Yeah.  I wanted to let you know that we're focused here in Portland, Oregon on the energy sector  with natural gas, crude oil, unleaded gas, and heating oil.  We believe in about a week's time we will isolate a situation where a 100-200% return  in a two- to three-month time frame is very realistic in these markets here.  Are you serious, bitch?  Yeah, that's right. 
[02:29:30]  What, are you just such a loser there that that's the only way you can talk?  Is that right?  Yeah, bitch.  Are you just because you don't have any money?  Do you just sit there and act like a punk?  Is that why you do that?  Yeah, that's it.  I guess you're at home during the day, so you must be sitting there just watching Playboy  Shailor.  Yeah, how did you know?  I wish you had a girlfriend.  You're trying to sell me some crap over the phone and you're calling me a loser?  You're going to take innocent people's money, some crap.  If it was so good, you would just invest all your money yourself.  Why are you calling people?  What are you doing at home during the day?  That's why I got to wonder.  I'm waiting for you to call. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I got a string of little boys walking through your apartment, don't you?  Yeah.  And your son is the first one.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, that's right.  You're real clever, aren't you?  Yeah.  I guess I'm just wasting my time with a guy who can't get his ass off the couch in the  middle of the day, I guess, right?  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  Let's go back to the porno channel, okay, buddy?  All right.  Thanks, bitch.  Sophisticated people invest their money in stock portfolios. 
[02:30:30]  Rednecks invest our money in commemorative plates.  Yeah, that's the legends of NASCAR series right there.  It's probably our personal favorite, Richard Petty hugging his mama.

I got instant feedback from somebody. 
[02:32:00]  Cage.  Oh, we know Cage from whackbag.com.  He does all the great photoshopping, Anthony.  When Jeffrey Ross is in studio, well, he is,  to ask him about the time he played Pratt Institute years ago.  I remember being at a show where some crazy freshman  pulled a knife on Ross because he didn't like a joke.  Really?  I guess that's why he did it,  but apparently the kid was trouble.  I remember being on stage, and the kid was,  well, before the show, I was early,  he was like floating around the stage,  sort of going, you know,  just sort of like weird, like Willard type of a kid, you know? 
[02:32:30]  Willard.  Yeah.  Did you see the new version, the remake of Willard?  Yeah, with, what's his name?  God, it was so clever.  I can't look at rats.  No?  Ever since I had a skateboard through Kenmore Square in Boston  at 5 in the morning to do morning radio in college.  Rats?  Rats everywhere.  There's a lot of good ones in this city.  My skateboard would scare them,  and they would just,  and they'd just go.  On my way to work,  did I tell you,  on the story in the air yet or no?  No.  On the way to work this morning, actually,  I'm walking by my building,  and there's like a garbage jutting out, 
[02:33:00]  and there's a guy walking towards me,  and a rat ran right over his foot  and into a little nook in the building.  Oh, that's so creepy.  A big rat right over his foot.  That's the scariest shit ever.  Yeah, and this kid just sort of like,  you know, like,  I think he like flashed it from the front row,  and I got a little weird,  and I didn't want to like...  Flashed it?  Like, hey, look what I got?  Yeah, I saw it.  I don't know if I drew any attention to it or whatever.  Like, I don't remember.  I was sort of...  This was a long time ago.  I was probably a little nervous and green and whatever,  and then for some reason, 
[02:33:30]  like, I sort of teased him a little bit  the way I've been known to do,  and he came up,  and he like had the knife,  and I like...  I didn't know...  There's like hundreds of witnesses,  so it's just strange.  Do I take this guy down?  Do I just walk off?  Came up on the stage with the knife  and brandished it.  I was actually open for Jeff on that show.  He was on the side of the stage,  but he was looking at,  like, behind a pole looking at you,  and you're like...  How is this guy allowed to...  to just walk around on the stage, though?  It was at college.  It wasn't like it was a big theater stage.  I think it was like one of those things 
[02:34:00]  where you just kind of step up  and you're on the stage.  It was like a student union situation.  Got you.  And he was behind a post,  and Ross is on stage,  and this guy's behind a post  to Jeff's stage right,  and I guess he was flashing the knife  that the audience couldn't see,  but you're like,  hey, well, this guy has a knife.  It was really uncomfortable,  and I didn't see the knife.  This guy has a knife.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, he's going into the guy with the knife, bitch.  Where's the punchline?  What?  He usually has a witty punchline.  I'm in fear for my life.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:34:30]  Take my knife, please.  Please.  Oh, that's...  And what happened?  He just wandered out, right?  They escorted him out.  No, no, no.  They took him out.  And you stopped the show.  You were like,  I'm not performing here.  You got really uncomfortable.  I'm not performing.  Yeah, that was the end of the show.  You were like,  you were weirded out by a minute.  I didn't go back on?  No.  No, come on.  Really?  It was like last?  Yeah, it was me,  and then you.  There might have been one more,  but I know it was me and you.  It was last. 
[02:35:00]  It was me and you.  Yeah, it was Tullis.  Jeffrey, also,  we're finding out that  you broke your hip  since we've been off the air.  Yeah, that's why.  How the hell do you  break your hip at your age?  That's like something  old people do.  Too much time at the friars.  I threw myself in front of  some six-year-old  cunt ice skating.  Wait, dude.  I don't like the warning thing.  I like just the shock value.  Just blur them out.  He likes the shock value.  It was Christmas Eve.  I'm in Bainbridge Island, Washington.  I visit my sister  and her my nephews.  You know, it's like Hanukkah. 
[02:35:30]  Nothing going on.  My nephews are like,  we want to go ice skating.  They're like four and eight.  The only ice skating rink  is an hour north  towards Vancouver.  Christmas Eve.  Middle of nowhere.  We're driving  to this ice skating rink.  We have to pass through.  We pass through  like a hospital  basically to get to the rink.  My sister's joke goes,  this is the worst hospital  in Washington State.  Oh, no.  Just happens to mention that.  You know, two hours later,  I'm in the emergency room  being surrounded  by nurses 
[02:36:00]  with like reindeer hats  and Christmas sweaters  who want no part  of this broken Jew.  You know, like,  it's like,  it's not like I'm some comedian.  I'm just Jeff,  you know,  some guy  laying on a stretcher.  Mr. Ross.  It was Mr. Liffschultz.  It was like,  it was horrible.  I'm like,  well,  I'm ice skating  and I don't really know  how to ice skate.  I haven't ice skated  since I was a little kid  and it's like a couple hours in  and the hot chocolate food place 
[02:36:30]  is like closed.  The ice skating's free  so everyone's on the rink.  There's just thousands.  It's just so crowded  and I finally get off the wall.  I'm getting the hang of it.  They're like,  one more lap,  one more.  And it's like,  they're going to close  You're on the last lap.  And some little six-year-old girl  like fell in front of me  and I didn't want to fall  and I threw my legs up  just to avoid crashing into her  and femur.  Wait, wait, wait.  Ow.  This is,  I'm going to get all...  Good morning, America.  You landed on your leg  or your hip?  My hip. 
[02:37:00]  Side of my hip.  And I didn't know right away.  I was sort of in denial  and they like,  I was like flipping around  like a flounder on the ice  and then the guys started to come  and then they were like,  clear the ice.  It was like,  there's literally hundreds of people  watching me.  Do you embarrass?  Oh, that's the guy  that ruined our last lap.  He wasn't embarrassed.  He was in pain.  Now, what broke actually?  Your hip or your femur?  Femur.  You broke the femur.  It's like a,  got like a cap to it,  like a head of it.  Yeah.  And it just snapped off.  Oh, wait a minute.  The part that goes into the hip bone 
[02:37:30]  where it kind of connects  the ball joint.  Right, that's it.  The ball part of your femur  snapped off.  Clean break.  So we didn't think  it was that big a deal.  They dragged me into like  a penalty box  and I'm there for like five.  I go, just give me a minute.  I'm fine.  Just give me a minute.  I'm fine.  You couldn't walk at all though,  right?  You're like, you couldn't.  And then after a couple minutes  I realize that I'm sitting  in the penalty box  but not,  I'm sitting like this  but I'm literally  holding myself up with my arms  because I can't put my butt down  no matter what.  Oh, man.  And I start sweating 
[02:38:00]  and finally I go,  you know what,  call an ambulance.  I don't know what's going on here.  I'm not getting up.  And then they start putting me,  you know,  they want to put me  on a stretcher  and I can't,  I can't even get the skate off.  Like it's,  what?  And like I'm pretty good  with that usually.  Oh, God.  And so the paramedics  like call a doctor  and they go,  we have a guy here,  so-and-so age,  so-and-so this,  so-and-so that.  We're going to give him a shot.  We're going to give him  some morphine.  And I go,  oh, my God.  This is for real.  They're going to drug me  and get me off this ice. 
[02:38:30]  It's pretty bad.  So I go to the hospital.  I'm laying there  and I don't know  what's going on  and this doctor walks in.  He's got his big  Christmas Bill Cosby sweater on.  He just walks over  with this look on his face  and he looks at the x-ray  and he looks at me  and he goes,  young man,  you are fucked.  Oh, no.  That's what he said to the doctor.  Get out of here.  He says,  you have a broken hip.  He goes,  I've been a bone dog,  an orthopedist  for like 20 years.  I've never seen a guy  with a broken hip before  who's not like 70 years old. 
[02:39:00]  And, you know,  they do a little pushing  and pulling and prodding  and I have three pins,  three metal pins  in the side of my leg.  So how long  were you in that hospital?  Five to four days.  Then I was three weeks  up at my sister's house.  Couldn't move.  And now,  Are you back to normal,  sort of?  Can you do stuff?  I can sort of,  like,  I can walk.  I can't really run.  I can, like,  have sex with, like,  like,  on an angle.  Anybody out there  with a slanted pussy,  I'm your man. 
[02:39:30]  Chinese chicks  are looking good.  Did they say  what happened?  Did you just hit it  at the complete  worst spot?  I kept saying,  what do I have,  like,  soft bones,  whatever that disease is?  I said,  what's the story?  Like,  why me?  And the guy goes,  you went ice skating.  You had a trick fall,  bad fall,  weird thing.  Don't go ice skating.  That's what happened.  Yeah,  stay away from that ice skating.  Just a fluke accident.  Jews should not ice skate.  That's why I don't ski  or ice skate, man,  exactly for that reason.  I know it's going to happen.  It's scary.  You never think  it's going to happen, 
[02:40:00]  and even my sister  was like,  oh,  you skate.  I don't feel like skating.  You take the kids.  More logic from Jim Norton.  He doesn't want to go  ice skating or skiing,  but he'll lick a girl's ass  that he doesn't know.  No one ever broke their hip  licking a girl's ass.  That's right.  You might break your hip  when you've got the hip  and you can't walk anymore  because you're so skinny  and weak.  I mean,  it all cyclical,  I guess.  But,  yeah,  I mean,  hey,  look,  it could be worse.  I mean,  you could have fallen  on your back.  I mean,  look at stupid Christopher Reeve  falls off a horse.  I mean,  a lot worse shit  could happen on a fall  if you smash your neck,  so it sucks,  but you're fine.  In the scheme of life,  I'm pretty lucky. 
[02:40:30]  I mean,  if this is the worst thing,  if anything,  it'll keep you from  doing anything else stupid  like ice skate or ski.  That's not a stupid thing.  You tried it.  A real day's work.  Also,  the other day,  you've been doing anything.  By the way,  can I say that  none of the comedians,  we all talked about it,  we found out Jeff got hurt  and none of us were surprised  it was a broken hip.  Not one comic was like,  what?  He broke his head.  Oh, man,  I hope he's all right.  But no one was like,  what?  I remember Sarah Silverman  and Jimmy Kimmel  called me up  and they go,  well,  they go,  well,  it's really sad,  but it's kind of funny too. 
[02:41:00]  I'm like in the hospital  on Christmas.  But you're Jewish.  Who cares?  Well,  I mean,  you know,  it's my vacation too.  You guys love  our Christmas holiday.  They can't put that  in a cast or anything,  right?  No,  they have three pins  and crutches  and then they give me  the physical therapy manual  and all the diagrams  are like 80-year-old people.  Like,  how to get your pants on,  how to put your socks on.  Have one of your grandchildren. 
[02:41:30]  It's like endless,  you know,  I was doing a figure ache.  There's like a million  ice skating jokes.  Dude,  how did you fly home  after three weeks  you were still kind of  straight-legged  or you could actually  I was on crutches  but I wanted to,  that was another thing.  I was on crutches  and I'm recovering  at my sister's house  which was kind of nice  because,  you know,  you're out of L.A.,  you're out of New York,  you're just in Bainbridge Island,  Washington,  spending some quality time  with my sister  and my nephews  and my brother-in-law 
[02:42:00]  who I know  since I'm a little kid  and kind of digging it.  Then I get an invitation.  You know,  you're cordially invited  to the world premiere  of A Long Came Polly,  you know,  the Ben Stiller.  And I'm in the movie,  right,  so I'm like,  oh my gosh,  I'm never in a movie.  I gotta get out of this.  Wait,  you were in that movie?  Exactly.  So I go down.  I saw it on a flight.  I'm trying to remember  what you did in that.  So I go,  I fly down,  you know,  like red car,  I get all dressed.  I haven't been anywhere.  I'm on crutches  walking down the red carpet. 
[02:42:30]  The publicist  was walking me down.  I had like two scenes  in the movie  where I sing  like the wedding band leader,  a really funny role.  And I'm so psyched  to be at this premiere.  It's like my first time,  you know,  out in public  in almost a month.  I do like 20 interviews  down the red carpet.  I get inside  with my girlfriend,  got a great seat,  not in the movie.  Cut out.  They never told me.  So there I am  like a schmuck  on crutches.  Oh,  completely cut out  of the movie.  Just going to a film.  That's all right.  Because the movie  wasn't that good anyway. 
[02:43:00]  Pretty much went  to the movies that night.  The basketball scene  was one of the funniest scenes  in recent comedies.  But besides that,  the movie just  didn't go anywhere.  I thought Philip Seymour  Hoppin was very funny.  Well,  he's a great actor.  He's great in everything  he does.  My scenes are on the DVD.  They're pretty funny.  Oh,  they are?  Yeah.  You made the DVD.  There you go.  And you also were telling us  during break  that you went to Iraq.  We were just talking  to Jimmy about  his Iraq experiences.  Yeah,  you went to Baghdad,  right?  Yeah,  you went before I did.  I think you went  in the Iraqi summer,  right?  I went in September 
[02:43:30]  of last year,  sort of during those  Jewish holiday times,  right before they caught Saddam.  Yeah.  But we didn't just go to Baghdad.  I went with Drew Carey,  who's an ex-Marine.  So we did like a psycho trip  to Crete,  Mazul,  Bakwaba,  Fallujah,  Blackhawk.  Oh,  you did Fallujah?  I didn't do Fallujah.  We went to all these little bases,  you know,  where all our transport engineers  live like 20 miles  outside each city.  And some of the bases  were just a couple  of dozen people  and some of them  were like 8,000 people.  How embarrassing  would it have been,  though,  to see Drew Carey  and Jeffrey Ross 
[02:44:00]  in one of those videos,  please don't kill us.  It's horrifying.  I know,  just sitting there  with the flag behind him.  It never would have been.  It would have been like  Drew Carey and others.  Yeah.  Right?  Also,  where are they going  to find an orange jumpsuit  that Drew Carey  could fit into anyway?  It was a pretty intense trip.  We did a show  in front of Saddam's  birthday palace  in Tikrit,  you know,  and they'd be getting  shot at every day there  by these Saddam loyalists  and suddenly they  defiantly put up 
[02:44:30]  this big stage  and lit it up.  Great.  Light it up.  And you're on the stage.  Suddenly the knife guy  didn't seem that bad.  Our hotel,  the Al-Rashid Hotel  in Baghdad,  did you stay there?  All bases we stayed on  because you had already  been there  and it already happened.  Yeah,  our hotel got hit  with a mortar and stuff.  While you were staying there?  Yeah,  we went back  and stayed there that night.  That was scary.  Excuse me,  I'm trying to sleep upstairs.  Could you stop  blowing this up?  And,  you know,  I went to the house.  You call us front desk.  How is,  yeah,  how is hotel service there?  Do you have room service? 
[02:45:00]  There's not.  Can you call down  and go,  hey?  Can I get a AK-47  ASAP?  Please.  And a pot of coffee?  There's a hole  in my hotel room.  Yeah,  I mean,  I got dehydrated one day.  We did a show  in a flatbed truck  in like,  you know,  Al-Ramidi Air Base  near Syria.  Eleven of them  was like 120 degrees  and afterwards  I'm like dizzy.  They took me to the hospital,  pumped me up  with some saline.  It's tough over there. 
[02:45:30]  I gather.  Support our troops,  USO.org  or the Wounded Warrior Project.  We went after  Saddam got caught  so they kind of  kept us,  I think,  a little closer  because all the insurgencies  were kind of starting up  so we really didn't have  much freedom  to move like that.  No,  Blackhawks  would need to go on.  It's going to get worse  before it gets better.  Yeah,  it has.  Like Dick Cheney says,  we're going to have elections  in January in Iraq  even if we have to kill  every Iraqi person.  Yeah,  they're sticking to that date.  Vote or die,  motherfuckers.  Yeah.  It's going to be 
[02:46:00]  vote and die.  Vote and die.  Vote and die.  That's where Puffy  should be with his campaign  because that's the real deal  over there.  So how are the Blackhawks,  did you guys,  when you were in Blackhawks,  I know you flew the C-130s too,  right,  when they do the combat maneuvers.  Did they do them  in the Blackhawks?  I heard that they're vicious,  man,  the way they fly Blackhawks.  Yeah,  the Blackhawks fly really low  and fast so they can't  get shot at.  I have it all on video.  I made a film.  You did?  I'm trying to sell.  You showed it at the  Hamptons International Film Festival  and it's pretty good.  How was that festival?  I'd love to see that.  Very,  very cool.  It was really neat  to be a director  in a documentary film festival, 
[02:46:30]  you know.  I don't like the Hamptons though,  but...  Well,  I didn't go,  I went to a nightclub.  No Aussie out there.  No,  there's a lot of Jews,  well,  you know,  just people.  It was cool.  Very good.  Excellent,  man.  All right,  Jeffrey,  we're going to see you  at Caroline's this weekend,  definitely.  Anthony usually comes  with his girl  or whatever.  That's right.  I'll go.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I'll definitely be there  this weekend.  We've got a couple new zingers.  I will absolutely go.  Eight o'clock show tonight,  I might be able  to pull that off. 
[02:47:00]  Don't you have to go to sleep?  Well,  usually it's like,  nine o'clock,  ten o'clock sleep time.  Weekends are like a repeat.  Tonight's an early show.  We've done before ten.  I think I can handle  tonight's show.  Love to have you, pal.  By ten o'clock,  I've been asleep  for a couple hours already.  That's a great endorsement  that the hosts of the show  come to show their plug.  Jeffrey Ross telling  a couple serious stories,  but very funny guy.  He'll be at Caroline's  all weekend long,  starting tonight  at eight o'clock.  For your tickets,  call 212-757-4100. 
[02:47:30]  Jeffrey,  thank you.  Don't be a stranger,  okay?  Who are you working with?  I'm sorry.  Two very funny guys,  Jordan Rubin  and Greer Barnes.  Oh,  that's a great show.  And it's a hot one.  Nice.  Fellas,  Mazel Tov.  Thank you.  Mazel Tov.  I love your new studio.  It's a very art,  isn't it nice?  Very homey.  There's not a lot of  homeless derelicts  hanging out in the lobby.  No,  not yet.  We're going to take over  this whole area outside,  though.  These other guys  don't know it yet.  Yeah,  the cubicles and stuff  are going to go.  We're going to put a lounge  in there and a performance  area. 
[02:48:00]  We're going to have a little  bar area.  Yeah.  Bands.  You've got to see the design  for this place.  Right now,  it looks like Mary Tyler  Moore works here.  I know.  That's perfect.  It used to be Luke  Grant's office.  That's perfect,  yeah.  But it's all going,  man.  It's great to see you guys.  Definitely.  Jeffrey Ross,  everyone.  The very worst  of the Opie and Anthony  F.U. Life.  See,  I'd like to leave  a great big  fuck you  to this goddamn  trucking company  out of Paducah,  Kentucky. 
[02:48:30]  You stupid  son of a bitch.  You almost run me  off the road  on I-75 this morning.  What you don't know  is I just really  don't give a fuck  and I'd let you  run me off the road  if you hadn't  taken your damn  maneuvers.  Stupid bastard.  You got a flatbed,  you're going to run  somebody's shit  over because  you're hauling  way over weight  and running  85 miles an hour  on a goddamn  interstate  that's built  for 70.  You red  bastard.  Fuck you.  Yeah, 
[02:49:00]  I got a nice  hello from Charlie  from LVI.  Fuck you,  Charlie.  Homo.  Yeah,  I'd like to send  a giant fuck you  out to XM  Satellite Radio  down in Washington,  D.C.  Sirius Satellite Radio,  they're out there.  They're C-blocking  sex bagel  at the lineup  down at the red carpet.  You know,  they're fucking  with the interns  down at the comedy show.  What the hell  are you guys doing  tomorrow today?  What the hell  are you guys doing?  You got a fucking gold  mine and you're  fucking it up.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. 
[02:49:30]  head out to the FU line  at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well,  fuck you very much.  Red 36!  ACC football.  ACC football.  The ACC today.  Maryland.  Virginia.  UNC.  Duke.  MC State.  Wake Forest.  Georgia Tech.  Clemson.  FSU.  And new to the ACC.  Virginia Tech.  And Miami.  It's the ACC today  on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:50:00]  It's Thursday,  the 18th of November,  2004.  I'm Maury Bikowski  with the ACC Today.  University of Virginia  has lost only two games  this season.  Both the teams  from the state of Florida.  That's FSU  and Miami,  respectively.  Cavalier head coach  Al Groh compares  the two teams.  Well,  at certain spots,  you know,  I think the Miami  receiving core  is very fast.  Very fast.  But I think  for overall team speed  that Florida State's  the fastest team 
[02:50:30]  that we've played  this year.  Let's flip it over  to the Miami head coach  Larry Coker.  He talks about  the win against Virginia  and then looks forward.  Well,  first of all,  it's certainly  a great win for us  to beat a very good  Virginia team  in Charlottesville.  That was certainly  very, very important to us  and we feel very fortunate  to come away with a win  in a tough environment.  But,  like I said,  we're back to football reality  and we're playing  an outstanding  Wake Forest team.  Of course,  I think it's been said  many times  with Jim Grove  and his staff  and the players  there just  are doing a fabulous job. 
[02:51:00]  They have the conference  leading rusher,  the leading punter,  two outstanding quarterbacks.  They're playing  with a lot of confidence.  North Carolina  versus Duke.  Great basketball  matchup this Saturday.  Wait,  they're playing football.  I'm sorry.  Well,  Tar Heel football head coach  John Bunting  knows that Duke  will come out to play  against the Heels.  We know that they'd  like nothing else  than to beat us.  They beat us last year  and they recaptured the bell  after we had it  for 13 years.  So,  that is motivation 
[02:51:30]  enough for them  and it's motivation  enough for us.  I think it's going to be  a terrific game.  And that's the ACC Today  on XM Satellite Radio.

[02:54:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  We're trying to get the gay  out of the show today,  and so far,  we didn't do too well.  No?  No, no hot chicks calling  to do stuff for us.  We haven't had a couple call in  to try to become  the sexiest state in America.  Why?  I mean, this is where  the listeners can help us out.  You know, you were the guy  saying that the show's  getting a little too gay,  but you're not helping us out.  We got broads coming in.  Not tomorrow, though, right?  Next week, we got lots of broads  coming in.  What is...  What? 
[02:54:30]  Broads.  The 25...  There he goes.  Gayest moments in rock and roll.  I didn't open the article  to this page.  It was open on the table.  Right next to the...  Rent Boys.  Here, sweetie.  The 25...  Now we gotta mention this.  We were trying to stay away  from gay material today.  This is about just pointing out  gay stuff.  It's not gay if you do it.  About rock?  Yeah, rock is such a guy thing.  Quote, unquote, or...  Rock was very gay in the 80s.  Yep.  I watch some of those videos now. 
[02:55:00]  You watch...  Because I love that they're  playing Beavis and Butthead  with the videos included.  Are they?  Very nostalgic and very funny.  Where?  M2.  Oh, very cool.  Oh, it's great.  It's so funny to watch those again.  Because, you know,  one of these hair bands  will come on  and they'll just like,  uh, no.  And it's really funny  but you watch it  and you think,  oh my god,  I used to watch that  and I would think  it was cool  and it rocked.  And they got those  huge poodle hairdos. 
[02:55:30]  Yep.  They're wearing  this skimpy ripped up  clothes and leather pants  and they're just gyrating  on each other  on the stage.  That was like cool?  You know that,  I mean...  What happened?  That was, quote,  cooler than some  of the New Wave crap  that was going on.  Well, everything, yeah,  kind of was taking the place  of what was before it.  That's what happened.  Right.  The hair bands...  So what was cool...  The hair bands  was a little weird on stage  but those guys  were getting laid.  You knew it.  The New Wave guys... 
[02:56:00]  It should have never been cool.  The New Wave guys  with the weird hair  and the, I don't know,  the parachute pants  and the zipper pants.  Those guys,  the metal guys  would wear the parachute pants  and the zipper pants  though too.  Yeah.  Yeah, the New Wave  guys had the weird,  you know,  are you talking  Flock of Siegel's  hairdo weird?  Well, they weren't  the only ones  with the weird hair.  Even Ozzy, man,  like in the shot  in the dark...  Why does it always  have to go back to Ozzy?  Because I'm saying  that even him,  like I watched  his shot in the dark video  and he looked like  Bette Midler.  That's true.  And he was barefoot 
[02:56:30]  in the video  and it was just...  Dude, I love him  but it was such a gay video.  There's like white doves  flying out.  Yeah, yeah, it was awful.  And he spins around  in one with his long  yellow and black coat.  That's why it's really  cool to watch  those old videos.  Oh my God,  what the hell  was everyone thinking?  Now don't you feel bad  that you almost  criticized me?  Yeah, I do, I do.  I think someone  deserves an apology.  No, I'm not apologizing.  Maybe a reading  coming soon.  No, no, no, no.  No, not at all.  I'm still safe.  How many times  has Freddie Mercury  mentioned in that?  Yeah, one through 23. 
[02:57:00]  He's got a few  in here, I believe.  I'm sure he does.  It's the 25 gayest  moments in rock history.  We won't spend  an hour and a half  on this, don't worry.  Remember Tattoo  Leeds Mass Makeout  Session during the  MTV Movie Awards  in 2003?  The Dyke Band?  Yeah.  With the red head  with the amazing boobs.  They both have  I think wife beater  t-shirts on.  And nobody cared  about them at all  except for the fact 
[02:57:30]  that they were  dyking out.  Right.  I don't remember.  Yeah, and they brought  a bunch of people up  and started making out.  Oh, MTV.  In 2001, Russian ad  exec Ivan noticed  an untapped musical niche.  Underage girls  who pretend they're gay  and the men who love them.  So he created Tattoo  a hottie duo  who completed every song  by eating each other's  face off.  For the 2003 MTV Movie Awards,  Julia and Lena,  18 and 17,  performed all the things  she said with an army of...  How old?  18 and 17. 
[02:58:00]  They were 18 and 17?  I didn't know that.  All the things she said  with an army of  paired-off horny babes  who on cue  play tongue hockey  for the cameras.  Citical yet titillating,  it says.  Nice.  We'll skip over.  Then in 22nd place,  David Bowie  fellates Mick Ronson.  What?  Mick Ronson.  How can that...  There's 21 gayer things  than Blowy...  Blowy.  Blowy.  Blowy. 
[02:58:30]  David Bowie.  No, no, David Blowy.  Hey!  What is with David Blowy?  Bisexual?  Oh, Lord, no.  David Blowy  protested in the late 70s  conveniently forgetting  his show in Oxford  on June 17, 1972.  Guitarist Mick Ronson  was mid-solo  when Bowie  dropped to his knees,  clasped his hands  to Ronson's buttocks  and began applying  lips and tongue  to the guitar strings.  Oh.  Oh, who cares?  Well, that's not really blowy.  No, a lot of idiots  have done that on stage, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty gay.  Ozzy and Randy never did it,  but I mean,  I'm sure a lot of fags  think that's cool.  Little Richard writes  to Tutti Frutti's.  Writes Tutti Frutti?  The song originally went  Tutti Frutti,  good booty,  if it don't fit,  don't force it,  you can grease it,  make it easy.  But with 15 minutes left  in a 1955 recording session,  songwriter Dorothy  was brought in  to sanitize  and heterofy  the lyrics.  Ah.  That number should just be  Little Richard, period. 
[02:59:30]  Little Richard was gay?  I see that.  I'm just going through.  Yes.  I see,  like I can't see  the whole page from here,  but I can see enough of it.  What's with the  nude men?  A lot of nude men  coming up.  Four acts  that incredibly  aren't gay.  Like you're amazed  that they aren't gay.  Oh.  I think that's  what you're looking at.  98 degrees,  six-pack sporting,  but we're 98% sure 
[03:00:00]  not gay sex enjoying.  Number three,  Hall & Oates.  Were they?  Weren't they?  Mustache notwithstanding,  they almost certainly weren't.  Uh-huh.  Number two was  Manowar.  What's Manowar?  Oiled up and fury,  codpiece equipped,  yet probably not gay.  I don't even remember  those guys.  Manowar, yes.  And then number one,  Milli Vanilli.  Didn't sing on their records  and probably didn't have sex  with one another.  Well, they thought one of them  was gay because he was well hung.  Ha ha ha ha. 
[03:00:30]  Please tell me that's the way  he killed himself.  He shot himself.  I'm really annoyed.  Did he shoot himself?  No, I think he did.  Hey, Todd, what's going on?  I think he hung himself.  Hey, what's going on?  What do you got, man?  Uh, I heard from a friend  who's friends with ONA  that you guys are going to be  getting rid of Norton.  We're not getting rid of Norton.  Wait, hold on.  Where'd you hear that from, sir?  Uh, from a friend.  Yeah?  Getting rid of Norton? 
[03:01:00]  Yep, but you guys are not liking  that he's always jumping in  and everything.  No, that's...  Really?  Who told you this?  A friend of mine  who's a friend of mine  who's a friend of Big Kev's.  So, is Big Kev starting this rumor?  I'm not...  I don't know.  I know Big Kev wants a spot  on this radio show.  That's pretty obvious.  Not that badly.  Who, uh...  Sir, who is your friend?  Uh, I'm not going to  whip out names here.  Why not?  What's the...  We're very honest on this show.  Are names important?  Yes, because then you figure out 
[03:01:30]  the source of something  and then sometimes  the motivation behind it.  Right.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to just...  Now, are you lying  because you don't like me?  No, no, no.  That's not true.  Okay.  I'm just asking.  That's not true.  I'm a big fan of yours.  Jimmy is a fantastic addition  to this program.  He's invaluable,  hysterical,  makes me laugh  on a daily basis,  and, uh...  And that's why  we need to get rid of him.  Any...  Guys, I don't...  He's taking away time  from me! 
[03:02:00]  Any chit-chat like that  is pure bull malarkey.  Hey, easy now.  I'll get rid of him.  All right.  Well, thanks, Todd.  That's, uh...  Hey, hey, Todd.  I didn't want you guys  to get rid of him  because he's a big plus  to the show.  Thank you.  What does your friend do?  You don't have to say his name,  but what's his relationship  to Kev?  Oh, that...  Friendship.  Friend?  Gay lover?  I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah, that's it.  Kev, any comment?  Yes.  Bullshit.  I don't speak about the show  outside of the show  unless I'm handing out 
[03:02:30]  wow stickers  like I will be tomorrow.  Did you write that speech down  or was that right from your head?  I want to know  what friend...  I'm winging it.  What friend is spreading  this awful rumor?  I do, too.  So, if it is actually  one of my friends  who's spreading this rumor,  I can kick his ass thoroughly.  Well, I don't care  if people spread the rumor,  but any chick that might  bang me because I'm on this show,  don't believe that falsehood.  There you go.  For a minute.  All right, the top ten  gayest moments.  We'll run through this.  Skid Row frontman  does Broadway.  That's when Sebastian Bach  caused the furor  by wearing an 
[03:03:00]  AIDS Kills Fags Dad t-shirt.  Wow.  Oh, remember that?  I forgot all about that.  And then he was on Broadway  doing Jekyll and Hyde  and, I don't know.  Rocky Horror.  I guess that makes him  make the gay list here.  I don't know.  That's just a back slam at him.  That's the way of going  let's put him on the gay list  so that it'll really bug him.  Yeah.  I'm sorry,  I don't want to get thrown off  that jumping.  No.  Number nine,  Boy George finds his muse  when we all found out  that Boy George 
[03:03:30]  and the drummer  were going out.  Oh, that was a surprise.  Boy George might have been gay.  Whatever.  In eighth,  Kurt Cobain gets kissed  on SNL.  Remember that?  Who kissed him?  Closing credits basis,  Chris Novoselic  bounded up to Cobain  and drummer David Grohl  and gave them both  full open-mouth kisses.  The unsuccessful  Nirvana person.  Number seven,  And Melissa Etheridge gets her sperm from David Crosby.  That's a comedian?  Norm Crosby. 
[03:04:00]  So, you know, two sperms walk into a box.  Oh, no, we don't belong here.  She's gay.  Number six, of course, it's Rob Halford telling everyone he's gay.  That was an unbelievable story.  That's something we all should have seen.  Yeah, just look at the old videos.  My God.  With his biker leather on and hell-bent for leather.  Hell-bent for leather.  Yes.  Number five, Cher makes the gayest video ever.  Remember when she's singing in front of the sailors with her butt showing? 
[03:04:30]  Oh, right.  And then she's riding the cannon.  Is that gay?  I guess.  I guess the sailors in it were gay, but...  She's awful.  Let's see.  Number four.  Number four, Freddie Mercury names his band.  Yeah.  Queen.  Queen.  Yes, we get it.  Just before his band toured with Leonard Skinner in 1971, bisexual singer Freddie Mercury  came up with the name Queen, which he snickered sounded regal.  Skinner realized its other connotations, but for decades they were the only ones. 
[03:05:00]  Queen's hetero audience was so oblivious to the pun that when mildly androgynous new  wavers, teardrop explodes, supported Queen in 1982.  Queen fans greeted the openers with homophobic abuse.  Boo, faggot.  All right.  Number three, gayest moments in music history.  George Michael getting busted in the men's room.  What an idiot.  And let's see.  Number two, Elton John comes out of the closet.  What? 
[03:05:30]  Well, for a while he was, you know...  Yeah, another one we all saw, but no one said anything about.  Who was on the receiving end of a Freddie Mercury blowjob?  Those rabbit teeth.  Oh, Jesus.  No, I'm just looking at the picture over there and...  No?  Anything?  I don't know.  We're all just picturing it.  Yeah, you kind of conjure...  And the number one gayest moment ever in music, Y-M-C-A. 
[03:06:00]  Village people.  That would have been a great Q, Eric, you ass.  Oh, well.  Did Eric miss a Q?  Not really, because this bitch stinks.  Well, we're just talking.  It's not a bit even.  My dad took me to see the Village People when I was a little boy.  Oh.  What?  Really?  In concert.  I saw them in concert.  Why would your dad take you to see the Village People?  I don't know.  Why would I play Monster Rain?  How many questions are we going to ask?  I'm just saying that I went to see the Village People and Sister Sledge was the opening band.  So, was he a fan of the Village People? 
[03:06:30]  No, I was.  I had all their records.  And you were family.  Wow, that's a big surprise.  YMCA.  I had In the Navy.  I had Macho Man.  Macho Man was great.  And the live one, Live and Sleazy.  You were the strangest little kid.  Just a little weirdo.  And he's a normal man?  No.  How did you discover the Village People?  They were huge in the 70s.  No, no, no, no, dude.  There was knowing about the Village People and then discovering the Village People.  I don't know. 
[03:07:00]  But I remember the construction crew cover.  I discovered in my little brain Zeppelin.  Black Sabbath.  We have something in common.  I was a big Sabbath fan when I first started getting into music.  Village People.  You knew the songs.  You heard them a lot.  But it wasn't like, I need to buy their albums.  He must have been an AM listening person.  Oh, my God.  They're coming to the Nassau Coliseum.  I got to wait in line to get my ticket.  Why would you get into that band?  The two concerts in the 70s my dad took me to were Kiss at the Garden and the Village  People.  And did you realize looking around what was in the audience? 
[03:07:30]  I don't remember it, dude.  I didn't even know they were gay.  I had no idea.  I mean, you know, Felipe Rose, the Indian I probably would have realized was gay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You know the names of the...  I know a couple of the names.  Felipe Rose and, you know, Victor Willis, the lead singer.  Oh, man.  Who doesn't know that?  I am what I am.  I mean, I should have known that that was a gay song.  Oh, my God.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  I didn't even know you entered the studio, Kenny.  Hello, everybody.  How are you?  I have a question for Jimmy Kins.  Sure. 
[03:08:00]  Why would you be coming into the city today?  I just...  I'm just wondering.  To see your lovely face.  Ah.  Why don't you raise the mic up instead of hunching over there?  Uh-huh.  You're 6'8".  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You have to raise the mic up to the ceiling.  Look at him.  I'm starting to think there might be something going on today, Anthony.  C-A-Y-A-M-I-G-A.  Now, I wanted to ask Jimmy Kins at that concert.  Is that where you learned how to rub up against people?  No, I don't remember.  Oh, frottage?  I engaged in frottage in high school, it's called.  Frottage.  I actually almost got thrown out of school because I did it to a teacher. 
[03:08:30]  Where you bump into a girl's ass with your hand and you see if you can get both cheeks.  I did it to...  I don't want to say her last name.  Wow.  I did it to a teacher.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's called frottage?  Frottage is the actual fetish of rubbing your cock on people.  I would do that all the time.  And one time I did it to a teacher in the pool area.  Miss Dunn, her name was.  Wait, you were trying to rub your cock on two cheeks?  Or your hand, whatever you could get.  Getting over that butt crack is a...  I used to go home and whack off thinking about how many cheeks I got.  And I got Miss Dunn.  We were in the pool area.  I walked by.  It was just me and her walking by and I just grazed. 
[03:09:00]  It was called grazing.  I grazed her ass and I felt her spin and glare at me.  And I just kept walking.  Oh, you little creep.  And it was your...  Yeah.  You definitely got her with your junk, not your hand?  No, no, no, my hand.  My hand.  Which was worse.  It was like I grabbed her ass.  I had the back of my hand, both knuckles across and the little slope.  Cheek crack, cheek.  This is better than him.  Leaving some chocolate treat he just ate on our butt.  My high school...  Little telltale fingerprints.  My high school was known for ETs. 
[03:09:30]  What were those?  Elbow tits.  That's too violent.  You couldn't get a good feel with an ETs.  No, it wasn't like...  No, it wasn't as soft as possible, too.  I mean, even just the elbow is a hard bone, I'm saying.  Just walking by, you just, you know, walk with your elbows a little higher.  That's all.  Dude, I used to love...  It was a weird thing in my high school.  Everyone used to talk about it.  Wow.  The ETs.  You got any ETs today?  My favorite girl was Liz.  She was a senior.  I was a freshman.  I used to always try to bump into her because she was juicy, man.  I would look at girls and just figure I have to graze her somehow.  They would probably all know and go, oh, here comes that creepy Jimmy, kid. 
[03:10:00]  Do you still do that?  No.  No.  It's actually...  I'll avoid it now.  It feels too violating.  No.  I don't do that at all anymore.  Ever.  What the hell was that?  So, the village people.  That's...  They were good live.  Sister Sledge, We Are Family, was a big hit.  We didn't enjoy Sister Sledge in 78.  Did you have village people posters in your room?  I might have.  I don't remember.  Oh, my God.  I don't remember.  What did you dress up like?  No, I didn't dress up as a village people.  Oh, that would have been cute.  Jimmy went dressed up like a little cowboy or something. 
[03:10:30]  No, I was...  I think Glenn was one of the guys, too.  I don't remember all their names.  Of course, it was Glenn.  There was the construction worker, of course, and...  I didn't know they were gay.  I didn't get it.  I didn't know village meant, you know, 14th Street to Houston.  I mean, I didn't realize that.  You thought it was like a village.  Like a village of cool people.  Right.  Where all men worked and sang.  Cool people.  They were cool.  The Indian was my favorite.  Growing up, the Indian was my favorite.  I thought he was the coolest, yeah.  Dude, I was about 10, and I knew they were gay.  And I didn't even know what gay meant. 
[03:11:00]  No, I was very young.  I didn't understand.  I didn't know that.  I just knew that's not how they dress when they're out on the street doing those professions.  I didn't know.  All these things add up, though.  The Monster Rain, this, the playing asteroids for a...  I was a weirdo.  You were a weird little kid.  Don't say was.  I used to fantasize.  It bothers me that you think there's a was in that sentence.  Kiss were my heroes, girl.  Kiss in the 70s.  Well, Kiss was all our heroes.  And I used to fantasize.  I bought every Kiss album.  So did I.  Well, it was bought from me.  But I used to fantasize about Kiss.  Not sexually, but that they would come to my house. 
[03:11:30]  I had a problem that they wore makeup.  I was a little uncomfortable with the Kiss makeup thing.  No, that's why I liked them.  That's why.  Because they were like superheroes.  They were like superheroes.  I got to hear this fantasy.  That they would come...  This was a recurring one.  The Kiss would come to my apartment and hurt me and kick me down the stairs and beat me.  And then hug me and love me and make me feel better.  You're kidding.  No.  To please tell me...  Oh, no.  That was a recurring fantasy.  It was never sexual, though.  It was about...  Like, I don't know why I associated...  Because I had a pretty normal household.  I always associated that uncomfortability with love. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, have you ever met his parents?  They're very nice, normal people.  They're the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Never abusive.  They were just...  They were really great to grunt with.  So where did this come from?  Oh, my dad drank a little abusive shirt.  Why would you have this fantasy that Kiss...  Don't know.  Kiss comes to your house.  Now, do they knock or are they just there?  Don't remember.  I can just remember my steps in my house and picturing Paul and Gene and all of them  loving me and making me feel better and hugging me and telling me I was a good boy.  But they're the ones that beat you.  That's the oddness of it.  I don't know where it's...  Look, why would I fantasize about... 
[03:12:30]  Why would my little play...  My favorite play friend...  I had two play friends growing up.  One was a middle-aged woman named Helen with a beehive hairdo.  I don't know where that came from.  That was one of my imaginary friends.  Imaginary friend was Helen.  Named Helen.  Helen.  With a beehive hairdo.  And one was a...  Tabs on all this, people.  You'll be tested.  One was a little boy who was me, but he wore a cape and his name was Jimmy Robinson.  And me and...  I can't absorb all this stuff.  You're going too quickly.  It's all true.  I want to remember all of this. 
[03:13:00]  And me and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  That I remember.  You know...  Wait, wait.  You and Jimmy Robinson...  My fantasy friend was Jimmy Robinson, but it was me.  In a cape.  But how could you and him hate you?  Gee, I don't know.  That was just the fantasy that I would play with Jimmy Robinson.  And Jimmy Norton was another fantasy character.  I'm sure there's psychologists all over the Tri-State area writing this down.  Oh, my God.  Split personality crap.  No, no, no.  I don't think it was split personality.  It was just this weird self-esteem stuff.  And you and him. 
[03:13:30]  Did you talk to Jimmy Robinson?  Oh, yeah.  I remember...  My only memory of vivid...  Jimmy Robinson!  My only memory...  Actually, I thought he was cool from Lost in Space.  Will Robinson.  Will Robinson.  Jimmy Robinson.  So my only real memory of Jimmy Robinson was him riding a tricycle, which was me, with  his cape on flowing behind him.  That's how young I was.  I don't know where he came from.  Did it say anything on your cape?  No.  It was just a plain cape, as all cool people have.  You don't have anything on your cape.  No, J.R. on your chest?  No, no, no.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  I think you were touched at a very, very young age.  It's very possible, dude. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, very.  Like, under five.  There's other things that contribute to self-esteem, too.  It's not necessarily that.  It doesn't always have to be that.  I'm just going to throw this out there, because I know it's a hacky radio bit, but I don't  know.  Would you ever go under hypnosis?  I've tried already.  On our show?  No.  They tried.  I can't be hypnotized.  They tried on Tough Crowd recently, because there was a really funny idea.  I don't know what they were going to have me do, but they were going to hypnotize me  to do something, and then Patrice, they were going to try to hypnotize.  Like, every time Colin said a certain word, Patrice would just shut up, because he would  always talk over people, so that was... 
[03:14:30]  But I can't be hypnotized.  I can't relax enough.  No.  I tried to, and the guy's like, you're getting sleepy.  Can you imagine him under hypnosis with, like, a real expert?  This guy was an expert.  No, I'm just saying, if we did it on the show.  No, I can't be.  Yeah.  I'm too easily distracted.  I can't be able to do that, anyway.  Okay, now, you covered the Jimmy Robinson.  What about the woman, now, that was your playmate?  I don't know where she came from.  Helen was my...  I don't know where she...  Helen.  Helen, an older...  That's like a librarian, or a...  Yes.  Was that the type of woman she was?  Yeah, she was in her... 
[03:15:00]  I'm picturing her right now.  After Helen Keller.  No, it wasn't after Helen Keller.  You could picture what she looked like as a real person?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She actually...  Maybe I saw a picture of my mother when she was very young, because it reminds me a little  bit of my mom, like, from the 60s, who I, you know, obviously was before I was born.  But Helen had a beehive hairdo, frosted, and she was my imaginary friend, was Helen.  I don't know why.  I love this stuff, man.  It's completely true.  It is insane.  That's bizarre.  Every day, I learn a little more about what just a little creep you are. 
[03:15:30]  Just a frightening little messed up kid.  Oh, it was...  I love it.  Stop with the where...  No, it's...  The was...  You know what it is?  Were and was is fine, because now he's an adult who makes his own decisions.  It's based on, you know, what he wants to do.  He's a freewheeling guy.  If he wants to buy hookers and have him crap on him, that's fine.  You're an adult.  As a kid, it's creepy.  Because kids do things like play with their friends, with toys.  They enjoy Christmas.  They enjoy their parents. 
[03:16:00]  They enjoy...  They don't make up little playmates that are them with capes, and little school marm-type  playmates that are 50 friggin' years old with beehive hair, dudes.  They don't play Monster Rain.  They don't...  They don't enjoy the village people.  It's just a creepy little thing.  The village people...  The only thing you're wrong about is the village people, because they were very big back then,  and again, when you're that young, you don't recognize...  They were like...  Colorful and fun.  Makeup.  They had the costumes.  I love Kiss for that reason, too.  There you go.  Oh, the Kiss beating story?  That's odd, yeah. 
[03:16:30]  I don't think we can find another listener that grew up listening to the village people.  I guarantee you can.  No way.  Dude, they were in the 70s, man.  They were huge.  I would hear them when I'm driving.  You know, my mother and I would listen, but you didn't become a fan of the village people.  You just didn't.  Well, back then, it was a whole...  There was not one person in my high school that went around saying, you know, he liked  the village people in high school.  Because there was a disco rock split back then.  I didn't know about that.  I was a little too young.  How old were you in high school?  When you were a junior or whatever.  How old were the village people popular?  78?  So I was 10.  All right.  He's 10 years old.  So it's different, you know.  I was 11 when I saw... 
[03:17:00]  My father took me to see Kiss in the Garden, I think Sheep Trick opened, in December 16th  of 79 on the Alive 2 tour.  I could even buy that you're 10 and you're a village people fan not knowing, you know.  Yeah.  That's fine.  The Kiss thing, you'd be a Kiss fan.  That's fine.  But you would be a Kiss fan without the images of them beating you up and then coddling  you and saying it's all going to be okay.  And hugging.  I told you, I got my picture with Kiss recently.  The first time I'd ever met, I mean, with Gene, I was starstruck.  You were scared you were going to get bitch slapped by Paul Stanley.  Dude, when he...  Did Paul and your band of Stanley to bitch slap you? 
[03:17:30]  He didn't bitch slap.  Oh, and the thing.  He put it behind the...  In your fantasy, did he hold your head close to his puffy hair chest?  No, dude.  It wasn't about sexual stuff.  Hello, everybody!  Dude, he...  We're going to cuddle Jimmy Naughton!  He, from behind me, I had the photo.  You could see the photo.  I'm standing there.  He reaches around behind me and puts his arm on my chest.  This is last November.  I tilted my head and put it on his bicep.  It was like a childhood hero thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was like...  I almost held his arms.  I didn't do it.  It was your fantasy come true. 
[03:18:00]  It wasn't about sex.  I don't want to touch Paul Stanley, but it was like a superhero.  That's another part of the weirdness.  He would like for you to touch him.  Yeah, probably.  That's another part of the weirdness.  If you said you had some kind of physical attraction and it was a sexual thing,  it would be disgusting to me, but...  But the thing is, it's creepy that you just wanted them to say, you know, to like your  company and love you and be my friend and hug me.  After beating you.  After kicking me down the steps and beating me up. 
[03:18:30]  That is so weird.  I got to play the Monster Rain thing.  We're not taking a break, but Monster Rain, the commercial by Laszlo from GTA.  It's not in GTA, but Laszlo decided to put this together for us.  Check it out.  He was just the boy next door.  Mikey, where are you?  It's a game for kids that's sweeping the country.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Jesus, it's Christ, my little baby! 
[03:19:00]  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  The game you play under the porch.  Monster Rain.  I like that one, man.  It's hilarious.  That is bizarre, though, man.  Yeah, I know.  It's a little odd.  I admit it.  I don't know where it comes from or what it is.  I don't know.  Jimmy Robinson.  The cape.  Well, here's a guy that also listens to the Village People.  Well, I'm stupefied today. 
[03:19:30]  Steve, what's up?  I'm using Steve because I ain't going to give him my real name.  I've got to back up, Jim.  I honestly listen to the Village People.  Really?  How old are you?  I mean, all right, listen.  We all heard them on the radio.  I mean, did you consider yourself a fan?  Yep.  How old were you?  So weird.  Two years older than you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, you were 12, 13.  I mean, that's pretty normal.  They were kind of cool guys, you thought, back then.  Oh, well, like I said, I'm saying Steve because I'm in Brooklyn.  Live and sleazy. 
[03:20:00]  You know, that was a good song when you were young.  I only know a couple of the hits.  That's about it.  In the Navy?  Well, in the Navy, I know.  YMCA, obviously, everybody knows.  But there's a couple of macho men.  You can't go to a wedding without hearing, like, YMCA or something at the end of the night.  And the Yankees, the ground crew, the ground crew would come out.  What's the stand for with the village people?  Young men carry AIDS?  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys, can you picture little Jim in his little Kiss Army makeup with a little black tear running down his face after getting his ass kicked by grown men in cat makeup? 
[03:20:30]  I never dressed up like Kiss.  Never wore the Kiss makeup.  Oh, well, that fixes everything.  It would almost be sacrilegious, I felt, that I couldn't.  Really?  Yeah, no, I never dressed up.  You were a huge Kiss fan then.  Beyond.  Dude, my father had to buy tickets six months in advance, and we were almost in the top row in the garden.  That's how Kiss in the 70s was bigger than anybody is doing. 
[03:21:00]  And was the night of the concert, like, this was a big thing, it was going to be amazing.  Dude, I was a god in the neighborhood.  No one else could get tickets.  They're like, Jimmy's going to see Kiss.  This is in August.  In December, he's going to see Kiss.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe my dad got me tickets.  Tell him to get out from under the porch.  It's time to go to Kiss.  Maybe there's another reason you were a god in the neighborhood.  Sucking all their wieners.  You'd think you would get better tickets for all the sucking you did as a kid.  My God.  I still didn't tell you about the brother and sister that I used to have sit on my face so  I could smell their pee-stay and underwear.  I'll tell you about that someday. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Considering the show really blows today, maybe you should pull that one out of your back pocket.  Yeah.  I can't say their names, but when I was that young.  Why the brother, too?  Again, it wasn't a sex.  It was just the smell of piss.  It wasn't him sexually.  I actually was a...  Was it you or Jimmy Robinson?  That was you.  I was, unfortunately, Jimmy Norton.  I'd love to blame that one on Helen, but I think she was trying to ixnay on the face-sitting A.  But, no, it wasn't about the one.  I was attracted to the sister, actually.  That was the girl that was naked one time in front of me, and I loved her ass so much  I was sitting next to some sticker bushes, and I'm like, you can either sit in my lap 
[03:22:00]  or sit in the sticker bushes, and she sat in the sticker bushes, which destroyed my  little self-esteem that...  And how old were you?  Again, second, third grade.  I moved...  See, I had no clue about this stuff when I was growing up.  Out of that neighborhood, Halloween of fourth grade, which is the very beginning of fourth  grade, so anything that I'm talking about, this stuff, all happened before Halloween  of fourth grade.  All of it.  Yeah.  And a brother and sister.  Not at the same time, but yeah.  Not at the same time.  They both would pee their pants.  I imagine they had a wonderful upbringing.  Not at the same time.  No, I mean, it wasn't some weird...  And it wasn't even a sexual thing. 
[03:22:30]  It wasn't some weird, he starts saying.  See, we could almost let you off the hook if it was them together, because then you  could say, well, I did it because the sister...  I don't know, but that means you were just under the porch with the...  No, no, this was behind the bushes.  Behind the bushes.  And what would you say, take off your pants?  No, no, no, with pants on.  No, it was never nude.  Oh, all pants on.  The only one I wanted to see nude was the sister, who I had a real crush on.  I would love to take a blacklight to his childhood home, behind the bushes, under the porch.  You'd say, sit on my face?  Don't remember how it would go. 
[03:23:00]  I honestly don't remember.  I can just remember liking the smell.  Yeah, there's got to be a beginning to that, though.  I'm sure there is.  It probably happened during wrestling, and I would pretend to lose.  I don't know.  Oh, got you.  Do not know.  But the girl I really had a crush on.  She was a year older than me.  So glad we're getting the gay out of the show.  Where is she buried now?  Yeah, where can we find her?  Brian from VA, what's up?  Oh, man, I'm telling you guys, you've got to get the gay out the radio.  You've got to get rid of Norton, man.  That's not gay.  What's gay about that? 
[03:23:30]  It's weird.  Listen to the show for the last month, man.  You're getting subliminal messages across the radio that Norton's gay from five years old playing Monster Rain to talking about kids.  It's the weird thing.  He's the last person that you would think is gay.  He's not gay.  Yeah, dude, I opened up about the childhood.  How many guys, maybe some haven't, but a tremendous amount of people did stuff in their childhood.  They're just too afraid to be open about.  Who cares?  I just think Norton's hiding something.  He's afraid to come out because he's lying.  Hiding something?  I wish he would hide something.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, I love women. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know if he'd suck them, but I believe he'd hold it in his mouth until the swelling went down.  We have to hear Norton talk about a different woman almost every day.  The guy's obsessed with women.  Mr. Norton is very secure in his sexuality.  Yeah.  There you go.  Thank you, Kenny.  Jesus, Jimmy, didn't you ever do normal things like play Little League or go to Disney World?  I went to Disney World as a young man with my girlfriend, and I played Little League.  I was a pitcher.  I have pictures of myself. 
[03:24:30]  Not a catcher?  No, in Little League, I played a lot of outfield.  Yeah.  Like, I told you, I used to spin in a circle once to the right, and I remember one time  I was playing for Young's Glass Service, and Mr. Wasenta was my coach, Wasenta, and  I would spin in the circle to the right in the outfield, and I'll never forget from the  dugout, he screams, hey, Jimmy, what are you, a ballerina?  In front of, like, the other team and my team.  Yeah, it was nothing but humiliation going on.  Was that Chico's Bail Bonds was the other team's sponsor, right?  Believe.  The Little League.  They're remaking that movie. 
[03:25:00]  Little League was when I had my first gay experience.  I was playing catcher, and the umpire checked me for a cup.  Really?  Yeah.  Kenny, Jesus.  Yeah.  I love the delivery.  I'm so glad you protect us.  Sparky, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How is it?  How is it?  Hi, Sparky.  It's Mississippi checking in.  Hey, Jimmy's normal.  Leave the poor man alone. 
[03:25:30]  We used to listen to ABBA and the village people, and we listened to all that as kids,  and we played the silly games.  You know, my sister used to have a tea party where her collie dog, her female collie dog,  was her husband, and I was the baby.  Wow.  Yes.  So, you know, I used to have dreams about sleeping with my big Aunt Jemima black nanny when I  was a little kid.  Oh, yeah? 
[03:26:00]  It's pretty normal stuff when you're a kid.  Yeah, I mean, Jimmy's all right.  Thank you.  He may be a little weird now, but he was all right as a kid.  Yeah, it's just that you don't know.  You just know certain things are taboo or whatever.  You don't know why.  I mean, you know, you're too young.  I didn't get rods back then.  Right.  You're just experiencing things.  I mean, you're just learning.  You don't really know that it's bad.  It feels good.  All right.  Boy, does it.  Thank you, Sparky.  Joe has...  I remember being friends with Casper the Friendly Ghost.  That was about as weird as I got as a kid. 
[03:26:30]  I was actually friends with him, and he came over the house, and, you know, and I played  with him.  Burned a cross on someone's lawn.  Can you realize?  Hey, that's not Casper.  Wait a minute.  We have our new neighbors from West Virginia.  There's a for sale sign in front of the Wilson's house.  Oh, yeah.  Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Casper the Friendly Ghost was my imaginary play friend. 
[03:27:00]  And what would you do with Casper?  I would go out in the backyard, play with the dog, dig holes in the ground, throw rocks.  Did you see Casper?  Like, I don't think I had an imaginary friend growing up.  When you have one of these imaginary friends, do you actually see them?  Oh, yes.  You visualize them, yes.  Yeah, I visualized, but never saw, but you...  Well, not saw...  I mean, in your mind, are you seeing Casper the Friendly Ghost as you play with the dog?  You look up to talk to him, you know, if you're digging a hole in the ground, you're  like, hey, you know...  Some people say those are ghosts, real live ghosts, and the only kids can see them. 
[03:27:30]  Casper.  Casper the Friendly Ghost.  You can see right through him.  That's weird.  But that's about as weird as it got with me.  He never kicked my ass and then held me.  That's so weird.  Joe in Delaware has a theory on Jim's stuff here.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Joe.  How are you doing?  Welcome to the radio program.  Good to be here, man.  I got your problem figured out for you.  All right.  The Helen woman was the chick who molested you before you were five. 
[03:28:00]  Little Jimmy Robinson with the cape was a superhero who you wished you could be to fight her off.  And that's why you need kids to abuse you and then coddle you.  Because it's your fault, but it's okay.  Possibly, yeah.  I mean, I don't know if I was abused by a woman named Helen, to be honest with you.  I don't know if Jimmy Robinson was going to help.  Who knows?  All kidding aside, do you think you were abused as a kid?  To be honest with you, probably not.  I'm not going to say definitely no, but I'm pretty open about searching for the memories and stuff like that. 
[03:28:30]  And anything that happened at that age was just consensual stuff with kids my age.  It's almost like it's possible somebody I did it with was abused and introduced me to it.  I don't know.  But they were all my age.  It was never an adult.  It was never a creepy uncle.  It was always, you know what I mean?  I remember the first girl that put her ass in my face, her name was Janice, in Devil's Creek, the woods,  between River Heights and Marina Gardens, the two apartments.  And she was a year older than me, and I put my face against her cool ass cheeks, and I still love asses today.  So a lot of it might have just been normal exploration. 
[03:29:00]  All right, let's say hi to Brandon in Atlantic City.  Yo, Rupi, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Why are you trashing Jimmy about having fantasies and then beating him up, and you went to college and had it done?  Thank you, man.  Good point.  At least Gene Simmons never asked me to pick up a yummy treat with my asshole and drop it on Peter Chris's porch.  I guess I should have known better.  You have the excuse of youth.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  That was an excellent point. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  I have nothing on that one.  Then Kiss made me lie on my stomach in the basement, and they poured hot sauce and made me exercise.  That wasn't my story.  No, I'm just not.  All right.  Okay, let's go to Ed in Jersey.  Hey, Ed.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Good morning.  Hi, Ed.  Jimmy, if I may revert back to you talking about Miss Dunn and playing frontage.  Mm-hmm.  Is she a gym teacher?  No, she was not.  Oh, then I apologize for wasting your time, because there was a girl.  There was a wood teacher, Miss Dunn, in my school, and everyone banged her, I thought. 
[03:30:00]  Where was your school?  Clifton.  It was Jersey still, but a little north.  Yeah, no, no, no.  The woman I think of, like, students banged her?  Oh, yeah.  Like, she would sit in the lunchroom with the kids that she was banging.  It was like several, not even one.  All the jocks.  No, I didn't go to school in Clifton anyway.  No, you went to Plainfield.  I was in that area, right?  No, no, no, no.  I went to another one now, but she was not a gym teacher.  No, I feel a complete ass.  Never mind.  That's all right.  It's still a good story.  All right.  Well, thank you. 
[03:30:30]  Bill from North Carolina.  What's up, Bill?  Man, first off, man, I'm just kind of pissed off at you guys as interns, man.  They suck ass.  Why?  Why?  They're great.  No, man.  No, I've called up there to give you guys a story here, like, Monday.  It was just freaking killer.  It would have perfectly segged into what you guys are talking about.  And then today, with Jeffrey on there talking about the broken bones, I called back up again  to kind of put it in there.  So it was a story.  Oh, you're the guy.  I already know who you are, because you call every day.  You're the guy that has a story.  Watch how smart I am.  It has a story about a stripper that broke her arm. 
[03:31:00]  And then was sexually assaulted while she was down on the ground.  What?  Yes.  I mean, that's kind of like I was telling them.  What happened was, I'm a police officer.  I called to an assault at a strip joint here.  We get there.  And what had happened is one of the strippers went to jump on the brass pole.  And when she did, she missed or something, but she landed and broke both her bones in  her right arm.  I guess that's her radius and ulna.  And it was open fracture, so the bones are hanging out. 
[03:31:30]  And while she's curled up in the fetal position on the stage, one of the guys on the floor,  you know, one of the patrons, he decides to freaking slam his fingers in and out of her.  And I quote from the guy there, was, it was like Indiana Jones reaching under the wall  to grab his hat.  She just slammed his hands in her and slammed her hands back out of her.  And to me, I'm sorry.  That's freaking funny.  I don't care who you are.  And if you guys don't think that's funny, that's just crazy. 
[03:32:00]  You just cut it off anyway.  Fuckin' cocksuckers.  I love the dejected hang-up.  What do you hear, cocksuckers?  Imagine if you never heard that story.  You're right.  Good point, Ken. 
[03:32:30]  John from New York City.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  I remember it was 1979.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  My parents were going out, and I said, listen, what am I going to do at home at night?  Why don't you get me an album?  And they bought me, I'm ready for the 80s.  Oh.  Village people.  Parents thinking they know what their kid wants.  Exactly.  So I remember there was a channel called Uptown.  It was only in their bedroom.  I remember listening to village people and watching this channel. 
[03:33:00]  It was like a porno channel.  And masturbating while village people were playing on it.  Wow.  Parents are out.  You could get a good jack in.  Yeah.  Parents are out.  I feel like I'm in therapy.  Remember that when Showtime first started?  They used to do that exercise show where it was girls in these leotards on these rotating round platforms.  And they would just do exercises, and the cameras would drift by them and slowly just give a crotch shot and then pan back a little bit. 
[03:33:30]  I had no clue.  Really?  No.  Not on that one.  Yeah, this was going on on Showtime.  I whacked to I Dream of Jeannie.  Who's Drini?  I Dream of Jeannie.  I Dream of Trini Lopez.  I Dream of Trini.  I Dream of Jeannie.  Nothing was better than Petticoat Junction.  Oh, with the three girls up in the water tower?  I'll say.  You know something?  That was a very, like, hot thing as a kid watching that.  And it was a split second.  It was the girls from Petticoat Junction, and they were bathing, I guess, in the county water supply. 
[03:34:00]  They're in the water tower, and their towels were hanging up on the edge of the tower.  And they would peek over the top and kind of give a little flirtatious look and then pull their towel off.  And you knew they were naked because they were bathing, and they'd show their bare shoulders.  And it was really, really hot when you were a kid seeing that.  I'll say.  Yeah.  Well, you said it, Kenny.  Jason from PA.  What's up, Jason?  Hey, I know what happened to our poor little Jimmy Norton. 
[03:34:30]  What, Jason?  He was about three years old.  He's driving in the car with his dad.  And some asshole on the radio told him Santa didn't exist.  And drink the magic juice.  That's funny.  Thank you, Jason.  Take care.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin in Buffalo.  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to let you know I got wowed by a car full of teenage girls yesterday.  Oh, there you go.  Nice.  That wow works like a charm. 
[03:35:00]  I'm telling you.  Yep.  Get that wow on your ride and watch the fun ensue.  Yes.  Women see the wow on the car, and if they're feeling it, they'll wow you.  Yes, they will.  Teenagers.  Teenage.  Teenage wow.  Teen wow.  Mean old Mr. Gravity ain't set in yet.  Very nice.  The only thing that can make wow better.  All right.  And you can get your wow stickers by going opiananthony.com as a place to fill in your info.  Yes.  Can I make a request?  That guy, I'm getting a half a rod thinking about this teacher banging people.  That guy who said the teacher banged people in Clifton, can you call one of the interns 
[03:35:30]  and off air leave her real name, and I'll let you know if it was the same teacher I had.  Because if I find out my teacher switched to another school and was banging people,  I'm going to whack my bag for six months.  Just thinking about that.  Oh.  I've been so excited.  Oh.  Yeah, but do it off the air.  I don't want to say her real name on the air.  All right.  Let's go to Keith in, well, Keith on Long Island.  What's up, Keith?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hi, Keith.  A little messed up story.  I mean, a lot of people played doctor when they were a little kid, and I remember, I have 
[03:36:00]  a vivid memory of playing doctor with this girl behind the bookcase in preschool,  and she bumped into me a little later in life after we got out of high school, and we brought  it up.  And apparently, though, we got caught one time by our teacher and didn't stop us.  Preschool teacher, man, watched us playing doctor.  Oh, little kids playing little doctor with each other, and the teacher just watched? 
[03:36:30]  Just kind of watched.  I don't remember, but she has a vivid memory of this.  Wow.  Well, what exactly did you do?  I remember she used to take down her pants, and we would go behind the bookcase, and I  would just kind of investigate the area at a wee four years old.  And then what?  That was it.  I mean, as far as my memory is concerned, that was it.  But apparently, we got in trouble one time, but we didn't have to stop doing it.  The teacher just watched us playing. 
[03:37:00]  And then what happened?  Nothing.  Are you sure you're making this up?  Okay.  How do we get verification?  I wouldn't know how to help you there.  Why not?  I do recall doing something when I was about ten, and I guess my sister was about seven 
[03:37:30]  or something, and she was having a slumber party over the house, and she had little friends  over, and they put on their little nightgowns, and I would make them have headstand competitions  against the wall, because their nightgowns would flop over their heads.  I'd be able to look at them in their little underwear, up against the wall, you know,  upside down, and I'd see their little panties. 
[03:38:00]  Didn't we do that same stunt in Massachusetts?  It still works like a charm.  Headstand contest, go ahead.  And weren't we 30 years old?  Ah, it happens.  Sure.  Hey, if something's good, you stick with it.  If it works, I remember one time, and this was at one slumber party, there was this girl  who lived down the street, and I was doing a headstand contest thing, and they were wearing  their nightgown, and she did the headstand, and she was wearing these panties that were  so loose that the leg hole slipped to the side, and I saw everything. 
[03:38:30]  It wasn't just, like, panties.  I saw everything.  And was like, I couldn't even deal with it.  I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head.  As a kid, you're just like, like a boil was going on in my head.  It was like, my brain was boiling.  Nice.  All right, we're going to take a break, Ant.  Remind me to tell you about the time I got caught staring at a crotch when we come back.  Jesus.  We're trying to get out of this.  Wow, it was a girl's crotch.  Oh.  A woman, actually.  So it was young Ben. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, there's something different.  Well, there's something different.  Ben opens the door with his big bulge.  It's frightening.  I bet his pubic hair is all in disarray like his head hair is, too.  It's all messed up and sweating and matted.  A little hat on his helmet.  We do think that Ben's hung like a retard.  I don't know why.  We have said that for many years.  I'm dying to know what Ben's packing, and not in a gay way.  I just want a girl to tell me.  It's either, here's what Ben is.  Ben either has the type of dick that as a man you go, Jesus! 
[03:39:30]  Or, it's three inches with elephantitis of the testicles.  No, Ben told me he's two inches.  From the floor!  No, really.  Ben told me he's four inches.  Wide!  You stink.  Wow.  Hey, let's play a Monster Rain song.  Which one do you want to hear?  We got Monster Mash.  We got, um... 
[03:40:00]  Where's the third one?  There's a third Monster Rain song?  We got three now.  Yeah.  Sweeping the nation, folks.  Oh, absolutely.  You like the Monster Mash one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The Monster Rain Monster Mash.  All right, let's do this.  Are we going to get to the lottery thing?  What lottery thing?  That you brought in?  We'll do it tomorrow.  It's not going to change.  All right, we'll do that tomorrow.  Yeah.  And we also have...  Remember we were talking about Caddyshack 2?  Worst sequel ever made.  Yeah.  Eric ran out and got Caddyshack 2, and we got Dan Aykroyd trying to be Bill Murray. 
[03:40:30]  He's hilarious.  Are you doing a movie with him or something?  Why are you kissing his ass?  Dan Aykroyd?  No, that's a very funny character he did.  Oh, in Caddyshack 2?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A hoot.  All right, hold on, man.  You've got to be on Dope.  Hold on a minute.  Laurie?  Yeah?  What's going on?  I'm getting fucked.  You're getting what?  Fuck.  What, you order Sirius?  Yeah.  You sound like you're in a car. 
[03:41:00]  I am.  I'm in an 18-wheeler.  You're in an 18-wheeler?  Yeah.  And are you guys on the side of the road at a rest stop?  What are you doing?  We're at our parking lot.  A parking lot?  Yeah.  What city or state?  We're in Texas.  Texas?  Texas, the great state of Texas.  What part of Texas?  South Texas.  What?  Laredo. 
[03:41:30]  Laredo.  Laredo.  And he's banging you right now?  Yeah, he is.  Feels good, too.  Hmm.  Well, we've got to hear this somehow.  I mean, she's just...  Hold the phone so we can hear the squish.  So you can hear the squish?  Roll the windows up.  Two of the windows down or up?  They're up.  Okay.  You want us to turn the truck off?  Well, we need the noises of love.  The sounds of amor.  Can you turn the truck off?  Is that possible?  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know if it's the truck. 
[03:42:00]  I think it's just cars going by.  He said he needs to be able to hear you fucking.  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  5'7".  I weigh 128 pounds.  I've got short blonde hair.  And I've got hazel eyes.  Are you one of those...  What are they called?  A lot lizard?  A lot lizard?  No, I'm a truck driver.  I drive with my husband.  All right.  And he's banging you good right now? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, he is.  You want to hear it?  Yep.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Let me put the phone down there.  What position are you guys in?  We're laying side by side and he's doing me from the side.  He's spooning you.  Yeah.  Nice.  Let's listen in.  Yeah, let's listen in.  I'll let you see.  Could you hear anything?  No.  I think your phone is a little screwy. 
[03:43:00]  Or line one.  It seems to always be line one that does this.  You think it's line one?  Yeah, it could be line one.  Good point.  I have noticed.  Um, hmm.  It doesn't sound like you're enjoying it, actually, Laurie.  I am.  It feels real good.  You hear me, ooh?  No, I like it natural like that.  If she's not an ooh-er or an ah-er, that's fine with you.  No, I don't want her to fake noises or anything, but...  Is it going to get better?  No, I usually do ooh-er and all, but it's kind of hard to talk to you and do this. 
[03:43:30]  It's just kind of weird.  That sound in the background, too, is annoying.  Where are you?  On the median?  On the truck off.  Damn it.  No, what...  Screwing and trying to break the sound barrier at the same time.  Why did he say, damn it?  Because he had to get up and stop what he was doing.  Why?  He was enjoying it.  Why'd he have to stop, we mean?  Yeah, why did he have to stop?  To get up and turn the truck off.  Oh, okay.  Just suck on it a little bit while he's turning the truck off. 
[03:44:00]  Just suck on it.  Could your tongue is ghoulie?  Okay, I'll...  I'll suck it.  Here we go.  Here.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  It's bad audio. 
[03:44:30]  No, I like what they're doing, but the audio, the connection is not good.  You can hardly hear it.  It doesn't sound good, but it's not their fault.  It's just the connection.  Okay.  I like what they're doing.  Hey, B.  Eat that.  That suck.  Ah.  Oh, baby.  Put your thing in. 
[03:45:00]  Ah.  Oh.  Baby.  That suck.  That suck.  Ah.  I hate that.  I know.  Why doesn't he rail you for a little bit as we go to break here?  It tastes kind of sweet.  It doesn't.  All right.  Paul wants in on this.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to let you know that Texas is now the unsexiest state in America.  Ah. 
[03:45:30]  There you go, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  That's funny.  How does he know?  Well, Lori, you got one more shot at it to become the sexiest state in America.  What else do you got for us?  I don't know.  I can send you a picture.  Okay.  Yellow treats at AOL.com.  Pictures are always good, but you want to try one more banging here?  Maybe doggy style?  Yeah.  All right.  You tell him doggy style.  You hold the phone, and we'll give you one more shot at this. 
[03:46:00]  Okay.  He wants you to do me doggy style.  A little spank on the buttocks, too.  He'll bust his load this way.  What are you saying?  He'll bust his load this way.  He'll bust his load this way.  Oh, look at that.  He'll bust his load this way.  Nice.  Where's he going to put it?  Either hole.  Oh.  I like that.  All right.  Now we're getting somewhere.  He doesn't last long this way, though.  Good.  No one does. 
[03:46:30]  That's fine.  Just let us know what's going on, okay?  Tell him to go.  You're messing him up because he has to keep taking it out.  Why?  This is awkward talking on the phone doing this.  Put him on the phone for one second.  We'll straighten him out.  Put him on the phone.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, man.  Hello?  We're trying not to mess you up, man.  Are we messing you up?  It's too late for that shit.  Just think of a little infant on her back watching your hog go in and out. 
[03:47:00]  A little baby who's hungry and needs to be fed.  You nasty fucker.  All right.  All right.  Give her back the phone and you take care of business.  Let's go.  Oh, man.  They're gone.  There they go.  That was great.  All right.  It was hard to hear.  Very hard to hear.  Unsexy estate in America.  We're not really taking a break.  We're going to play Monster Rain in honor of...  Just a little baby sitting there.  In honor of Jimmy's childhood stories today.  All right. 
[03:47:30]  Here I am out for his throw, minding my own vampire business.  Hey, what's that noise under the porch?  I better investigate.  Oh, my goodness.  Stop that.  I am scarred for life.  I was walking one fine day when I first saw two young eager boys hidden under the porch.  One was little Jimmy Norton with eyes so down. 
[03:48:00]  He was on his friend's clutch making slurping sounds.  He did the rain.  He did the Monster Rain.  The Monster Rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain.  He did the rain.  He did the Monster Rain.  With his little buggy eyes and soft little breasts.  Young Jimmy saw that he was making a mess.  His hair was all sticky, but he kept his pace.  Now we know why he likes hookers to piss on his face. 
[03:48:30]  He did the rain.  He did the Monster Rain.  The Monster Rain.  Little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain.  He did the rain.  He did the Monster Rain.  The two boys were just having fun.  The Monster Rain had just begun.  The other boy's father caught them and he said,  Hey there.  What are you doing to my son?  Hey, young Jimmy. 
[03:49:00]  Let me tassel your hair.  Why are you so sticky and covered in sweat?  Your spit-stained cheeks are so very pale.  Why not just invent a game called the first night in jail?  He did the rain.  He did the Monster Rain.  The Monster Rain.  Little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  He did the Monster Rain.  Now the Jimmy's a little over.  He must repent that he has such memories of rubber cement. 
[03:49:30]  He should have protested and stated quite plain.  Dude, I'm not gonna taste your DNA.  Oh, no, you hear that?  Get at it again.  Man, that's disturbing.  I'm going to have to have my eyes washed.  Why would anybody even tell this story?  Little Jimmy Norton's a sociopath.  Oh, he sure is.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Oh, yeah.  One of the many Monster Rain songs that have come in, Anthony. 
[03:50:00]  Sweeping.  We have been playing the better ones, I guess.  I'm trying to find.  There's a third one that's really good.  Is it?  Yeah.  I kind of thought it was...  All right.  Just all right?  Yeah, all right.  I like the effort people put into it, but sometimes it doesn't turn out that good.  All right.  John in Texas, what's up?  Hey, good morning, ONA.  How are you, buddy?  Oh, not too bad.  All right. 
[03:50:30]  I would like to thank Jimmy for his PSA on Monster Rain because I found my second-grade  son and my kindergarten daughter playing something they called Monster Dark.  They were in one of my bedrooms.  They had the lights off.  I went in, kind of freaked out of her giggling and sound, turned the lights on, and my little  girl was just pulling up her underwear, asked my son what the hell was going on.  He said they were playing Monster Dark.  Monster Dark.  Excellent.  The sequel to Monster Rain. 
[03:51:00]  Yes.  It was just last week.  Did he explain exactly what they were doing?  No.  His face was bright red.  He was totally freaked out that I had caught him.  My little girl would not tell me what was going on.  Get used to that.  Yeah.  Don't be such a C-blocker, sir.  Let the kids enjoy themselves.  I love you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  See you, bro.  This is the third woman to call the show today.  Jenny in Jersey. 
[03:51:30]  What's up, Jenny?  Nothing.  When I was younger, I had two playmates.  Boyfriend and girlfriend, we used to call it.  Boyfriend and girlfriend was the game?  Yeah.  And we did everything with each other all the way up until seventh grade.  Seventh grade?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Were they girls or guys?  Both girls.  They were girls.  And one of you would be the boy and one would be the girl?  Yeah.  Most of the time, I think it was at separate times.  Like, we never all did it together. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  So.  And what type of stuff would you do together?  We'd go down each other.  We'd think of each other.  First grade, my friend, she showed me my first porno.  You saw your first porno in the first grade?  Yeah.  She had two brothers.  They were both in their 20s.  Ooh.  What's your story now?  My story or hers?  Slut.  Slut?  No, not really.  I like that.  Kind of slut.  I have my moments. 
[03:52:30]  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Ah.  Whereabouts?  The predator that he is is circling.  Ah, he's always on the lookout, Anthony.  He's lifted his nose in the air, and he's sniffing in what direction the game is.  Yeah.  What exit?  He's a great lookout.  Are you at work or at home?  I'm actually supposed to be in class right now.  Oh.  How old are you?  I'm 25.  I'm going for my doctorate.  Oh, now you want to play doctor for a living.  Yeah.  Very cool.  You're a big fan of the show? 
[03:53:00]  Yes.  I bought XM Radio since I heard you guys were coming back.  Oh, thank you.  And you're a big fan of that game, What's in My Pants?  Yes, I am.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Uh, you want to play?  Do we have time to play What's in My Pants?  Just did.  All right, hold on the line.  All right.  Are you driving, though?  No, I'm actually parking a lot at my university.  You know, I would love to play with Jenny, but the problem is the phone is a little bad.  Yeah, the phone is a little off.  Can you call us back from a better location? 
[03:53:30]  Maybe tomorrow or something?  Oh, I'll call back tomorrow.  Please?  No, because the phone isn't that great.  Please?  Jimmy wants to spark up a relationship here.  Anthony, Caddyshack 2.  Really fast.  I got some examples of Dan Aykroyd's fine acting in Caddyshack 2.  Fine acting?  You think this is one of his better moments in film?  It's called sarcasm.  I'm amazed every time this movie's on TV, I do take a peek.  I barely ever see it.  Trying to figure out why they would ever release this in the first place. 
[03:54:00]  To try to get money that they wound up getting from Caddyshack.  It's the worst sequel ever, but more of a tragedy is the fact that Dan Aykroyd tried to act like  Bill Murray in this movie instead of them giving him another character or something.  Yeah.  They had that one guy from Unsolved Mysteries.  What the hell's his name?  Jack Palance?  Stack.  No, Robert Stack.  He was in it.  Chevy Chase reprising his role as Ty Webb and just doing an awful job just stumbling through this one.  Jackie Mason? 
[03:54:30]  Jackie Mason trying to take Rodney Dangerfield's place.  And that's it.  The Unsolved Mysteries guy was there to take the place of Ted Knight.  Ted Knight, I guess, right?  And that just wasn't ever happening.  What they did was they casted the movie.  They cast this movie with people that are just second-rate excuses for who they had in the original movie.  And it does not work.  I thought Aykroyd stole it, though.  Shut up.  He was great.  Aykroyd got a hot wife. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, Donna Dixon, right?  Yeah.  All set.  Might have been hot.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Back in the Hogan's Heroes days.  Was she on that?  No.  That was Ivan Dixon, I think.  There's a lot of people outside the studio.  What are we doing after the show today that all these people are around?  I don't know.  Anthony, so you want to hear this?  Yeah, let's hear the cringeworthy dialogue from Dan Aykroyd.  Why would he do this voice? 
[03:55:30]  I hate to mess him up.  This is going to be an easy one.  One quick stroke, I'll bonk him and be out of here by shutdown.  Easiest money I ever made.  How the hell am I supposed to concentrate with Smurf like that, walking around?  You did that on purpose.  Is he after the gopher?  Naughty, naughty.  He's meaning the gopher.  Well, I may have to put you in the duck suit. 
[03:56:00]  And your little dog, too.  Aha.  And your little dog, too.  That's so funny.  Was he thinking, wow, this is going to be as big as Bill Murray's character was in Caddyshack 1?  Like, people are going to quote these lines for years to come, and it's going to be a classic movie moment.  I'll just try to put on a similar voice and be retarded and walk around. 
[03:56:30]  I just never got this.  These next two clips, they're short.  It's embarrassing.  I can't listen to it.  Remember the arrow in the ass and sucking out the poison?  This is so embarrassing to listen to and to watch.  Funny stuff.  Okay, little gopher.  Hey, your friend Tom.  I got junk food.  Everybody loves mass-produced cream-filled pastries. 
[03:57:00]  Shut up, Jim.  I was just trying to get your attention before.  Come on.  Hmm.  For God.  Huh?  Very subtle, Mrs. Estherhouse.  I read you.  How's it clear?  Why?  I don't know.  He's looking for the gopher.  Woo! 
[03:57:30]  That hurts.  Boing.  I think it was a big mistake tipping that arrowhead with poison.  So he has the arrow with the poison in his ass now.  Yeah.  Did I say that was the one weak part of the first one was that stupid gopher?  I hated the dancing gopher.  Although it reminded me of Ben Sparks' body.  That's the only thing I liked about the gopher was that it reminded me of young Ben.  Awkward and dancing.  And then finally...  Excuse me, Mr. Something. 
[03:58:00]  Might I trouble you for a scalpel or some forceps or maybe even a pair of pliers?  See, I had a little trouble getting out of the roughs over there.  And damn if I didn't accidentally shoot myself with a poison-tipped crossbow dart.  If I pull the arrow out, will you please suck out the poison for me? 
[03:58:30]  That's gotta be awkward.  You pull it out, I suck.  Is there any money in it for me?  Ah, Chevy.  Ah, Chevy.  He's considering it.  That's Chevy.  That's Chevy.  You never know what he's gonna say.  Oh, no.  That's nutty.  Someone filmed this, saw this, and said, yeah, we can release this.  Yep.  That is awful.  And coming off of the fact that Caddyshack is such a good, funny movie.  It makes it even worse.  Gopher.  All right, we got a couple minutes left. 
[03:59:00]  Let's go to Rob.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today, Rob?  How you doing, guys?  Hi, Rob.  How you doing, Logsy?  I learned that every five-star hotel in Iraq comes with an AK-47 and a pot of coffee.  And a pot of coffee.  Very good.  Logsy.  It was a very educational show, after all.  Frank, what did you learn today?  I remember Logsy.  That Opie still hates one thing.  Ah.  Shut up.  Leave it on. 
[03:59:30]  Good boy.  Thank you.  Excellent call.  You don't like that, do you, Opie?  No, not at all.  It's not even a joke.  Opie freaks out.  I don't know where that comes from.  It's like scratching a blackboard to Opie.  Oh, my God.  The sound of a vacuum cleaner.  Here.  Wow.  I love that sound.  That is the weirdest.  And the smell.  I love the smell of vacuum.  It goes right through me.  I don't know why.  PJ from the Bronx, what did you learn on the show today?  How you doing?  I learned a couple of things about our little scrumptious.  It's still getting me.  What?  I learned a couple of things about my dear scrumptious over there. 
[04:00:00]  Hi.  Okay.  How you doing?  All right.  First of all, I learned that when you're little, you made a little brown bagel, Crinkle Crinkle  with Sweet Baby Indian from the village people.  Okay.  And second, that his new imaginary friend is Claire from the little game Guess Who.  When you're little, you play peekaboo with her when you flip her up and down.  All right.  I'm going to punch you out.  Ah.  He knew.  He knew.  Steve, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, boys.  I learned that Anthony's imaginary friends were the KKK.  I also learned that Opie prefers to fist. 
[04:00:30]  Very good.  He did say that.  I said I like a little fist.  Just a little.  Cage learned Jim Norton is the coffee diva.  Cody from Buffalo.  I learned today Lisa Lampanelli equals Triumph the Insult Moose.  Detective David in Jersey.  I learned today way too effing much about Norton.  And Mike in Jersey today.  I learned that Wendy would lose it if Ant dropped the C-bomb in front of her.  Yes.  I think that's about it for today, right?  Winding down.  Guido learned that black Japanese bees are called honets. 
[04:01:00]  That was pretty good.  All right.  Let's go to Tampa.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I learned that Hulu is having people rub phones up against their boobs.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he's describing them as veiny.  He's stealing the what's in my pants and putting the what's in my blouse.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  Watch out.  Bye, sir. 
[04:01:30]  Robin, Illinois.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Norton likes his women like he likes his coffee.  Hell, yeah.  Under 18.  Very good.  All right.  I want to thank Francine for stopping in with her comedy tape.  I think we went to dead air during that segment.  I think they got a fix for the replay, hopefully.  And Jaime will be up tomorrow.  And I think Jaime will be doing a little reading for that dead air.  Oh.  All right.  Also, Jeffrey Ross.  Thanks for him stopping by.  He's going to be at Caroline's all this weekend.  And I think that's all we got for today. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, man.  But we're going to go to the show.  You guys can come down.  How do we propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive dick show?  The OPNM show.  I don't understand anything, so there you go.  You know my problem?  I watch too much news, man.  That's my problem.  That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in one day.  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour. 
[04:02:30]  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless.  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man.  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him.  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of AIDS. 
[04:03:00]  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid.  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports.  This is the nicest part of the South. 
[04:03:30]  This is like the only part of the South you go, like, when I go there, nobody goes,  man, I wish you could take me back to New York with you.  You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers, be hiding in your car and shit.  Shit, boy.  It's nice here.  Too hot, boy.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July. 
[04:04:00]  Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day.  90 degrees and shit.  It's, like, hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen.  Hi, I'm Lazlo.  Microsoft is getting into the watch business.  The company has struck deals with several watch manufacturers, including Swatch, to produce  watches that use Microsoft's smart personal object technology.  The wireless format allows you to receive news, sports, weather, horoscopes, and stock 
[04:04:30]  quotes on your watch.  Owners can personalize their watch at the MSN Direct website.  And, like everything else these days, you get to pay a subscription fee.  It's 40 bucks a year, so you can read news and sports scores on your wrist.  And when you sit there staring at your watch for five minutes, people will think you're  so dumb you can't tell what time it is.  This Swatch watch is called the Paparazzi and sells for $150.  Another new trend in big, bulky, oversized watches is the MP3 watch.  Several manufacturers are releasing watches that store 256 megabytes worth of MP3s, or 
[04:05:00]  any other files you want to store there.  Some models even record voice memos, so you can talk into your watch.  For more, go to technotunes.net.  I'm Lazlo.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.
