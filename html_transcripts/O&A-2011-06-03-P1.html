<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a scathing review of a recent interview with Paris Hilton, whom the hosts repeatedly called a "drip" and a "dud," criticizing her disinterest, reliance on her publicist, and inability to provide substantive answers.  They speculated on her continued fame, comparing her to Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan, and discussed the generally negative reception to the interview, including their own feelings of being unfairly criticized by other media outlets, particularly "OutQ." The segment also included vulgar language, sexually suggestive comments, anecdotes about their appearances on other shows (including Hannity), a discussion about Jim Norton's KISS poster, and speculation about Hilton being paid for the interview.  The hosts also engaged in a tangent about the etymology of "stick in the mud," and further analyzed various words and phrases applied to Hilton, and played music interludes.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about a businessman who owns both shooting ranges and movie theaters in the same building. This segued into a conversation about AIDS statistics, particularly the high rates among Black men engaging in male-on-male sex, with the hosts mentioning the "down low" and the lack of acceptance of gay lifestyles in some communities. They criticized birth control commercials and expressed anger towards religious groups opposing stem cell research. The conversation veered towards Mitt Romney's presidential image (specifically the size of his chair during an interview), the 30th anniversary of AIDS (which prompted an offensive song about everyone having AIDS), and a review of a South Park episode featuring Chinese and Japanese stereotypes, including criticism of John Liu's reaction to it.  A caller, Mike from Jersey, advocated for increased stem cell research funding, sparking a debate on the issue.  Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal was also discussed at length, focusing on a leaked picture and the alleged reaction of CBS reporter Marsha Kramer, who was supposedly denied an interview and had the police called on her.  The hosts then made sexually explicit comments about a picture from a Miami Heat game showing a woman with her legs spread, and engaged in highly offensive commentary regarding Casey Anthony and her trial. The segment ended with repeated plays and analysis of a clip from Ron and Fez's show, dubbed "the blueberry incident," focusing on Fez's apparent on-air meltdown and awkwardness.

A significant portion of the show continued the analysis of the Ron and Fez "blueberry incident," focusing on Fez's struggles with a conversation about blueberries, his breathing, and apparent depression.  The hosts repeatedly played the clip, noting a studio door closing sound which a listener, Travis, identified as Ron leaving to get a turkey sandwich for Pepper Hicks.  The hosts discussed Ron's actions, Fez's "meltdown," and the odd combination of blueberries and turkey. The conversation shifted to a previous incident where Opie upset Fez, causing him to cry, and further speculation about Justin Stengel's alleged intent to further upset Fez. Various tangents followed, including discussions about different juices, a listener's claim about Fez having a performance deadline, additional off-color jokes, a humorous impersonation of Fez crying, speculation about Angie Verona, and listener calls about various topics, including a man named Voss suing a bar.  Several musical artists (Trent Reznor, Karen O, Eddie Vedder) and their music were also discussed.

The final segment featured a recurring bit with listener-submitted rhymes, many of which were offensive and racially charged.  A significant portion was dedicated to a caller, "Bobo" (Daniel Curlin), who was subjected to repeated multiplication problems as a condition for regaining the right to use the nickname "Bobo," which the hosts claimed to have trademarked. This involved considerable teasing and mocking. The hosts' banter also included discussions about their work schedule, Frank Sinatra's hygiene, and other unrelated topics.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Bobo's peculiar mathematical abilities and a break before resolving the "Bobo" trademark issue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  No, is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom's speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Friday, Friday, yeah, yeah.  Friday, fun day, fun day.  Oh, thank you. Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. We only worked four days this week.  Four days.  Doesn't matter. Once it reaches Friday, it just feels like a 10-day week.  I kind of like this Howard Stern schedule.  Four days, it's nice.  Yeah.  We get to live the Howard Stern schedule every once in a while.  That was nice taking a four-day week.  Actually, it's the old Howard Stern schedule.  The new Howard Stern schedule is three days a week.  Good for him.  Good for him is right.  Lucky ducky.  Jesus.  Chucky ducky, quack, quack. 
[00:02:00]  Chucky ducky, quack.  Chucky ducky, quack, quack.  I couldn't be more tired.  Are you a sleepy boy?  I literally tried to turn in, but I did Hannity and I snapped.  I wanted to nap.  Yeah.  And I got a two-hour nap and I did the show.  But I had coffee at the show.  Oh.  Because you have to before you go on.  What, for Hannity?  Yeah, you just do it.  You want to have some energy.  That fucks you for the night, though.  Oh, dude.  You can't have coffee that late at our age. 
[00:02:30]  I had coffee at nine o'clock.  Couldn't make sleepies?  I literally laid there and just could do nothing.  And stared at your kiss poster?  No, it's above my head in the dark, but I knew it was there.  I just kept thinking, Gene Paul Peter Ray says Gene Paul Peter.  They were looking down at you.  I love that a grown man has a kiss picture over his bed.  It is funny, right?  It is very funny.  It's so long.  By the way, that kiss poster was a bus ad in the 70s.  And I bought it off eBay because it was from the Madison Square Garden show that my dad took me to. 
[00:03:00]  That was actually an original bus ad that I bought off eBay for $100.  And now they look over you as you sleep at night.  They watch over me.  Like the Lord.  You weren't sleeping.  Like the Lord.  That's your Lord.  That's right.  Considering I was in the Lord's and all ties in nicely.  The Lord's.  You dumb gang.  You were good on Hannity last night.  Thank you.  That was a really fun one.  It was good, huh?  I was talking to...  I know I'll never do the show because all of a sudden you guys are talking about Mitt Romney 
[00:03:30]  and I'm just sitting there.  What would I say?  Mitt.  There wasn't a lot to make fun of with him.  I mean, he came off pretty good.  It's like if he...  I just disagreed with something like a kind of a we don't talk to terrorists at all thing.  So I just commented on that.  But there wasn't much to make fun of.  I mean...  Right.  You know?  He's popping up as the front runner so far.  He's going to be your guy.  His chair was a little small.  Unless someone comes out of nowhere.  Yeah, his chair's a little small.  Did you notice that?  The chair he was sitting in?  His little chair. 
[00:04:00]  He looked like Hannity was scolding him in the chair.  I was like, sit down, Mitt.  I'm going to talk to you.  But it looked like you had the kid's seat last night on Hannity.  That's always the seat I'm in.  It's always putting you in the seat of honor, I call it.  Sit on a phone book.  Do I look too small?  We kind of laughed a little.  I like to walk tall.  I mean, you were great on the show, but it looked like you might have had the kid's seat.  I tell him to introduce me as Buford Pusser.  I want to carry a big stick.  That governor, Ehrlich, his name was, was governor of Maryland a few years ago. 
[00:04:30]  And the woman's name, I don't remember.  Her husband does something for me.  She's a strategist.  Yeah.  They were really...  I talked to them before the show.  I never talked to them before the show.  Really?  No.  They seemed to like you.  They were great.  It was really, really nice.  They seemed like they might know who you are and are fans.  He did, yeah.  I wouldn't say fans, but the governor, he knew when I came in.  He knew my stand-up.  Right, right, right, right.  Hey, he's got me.  Then he went home and didn't sleep, huh?  Couldn't sleep.  Fuck.  Poor boy.  I was sleeping until my phone rang in the middle of my night. 
[00:05:00]  I didn't mean to call you.  I was just thinking of you.  I need a guide.  I need a guide.  I couldn't come.  I see the voice.  Oh, God.  I didn't mean to...  Because Obi went, hello, and I went, oh, thank you.  Gurgle, gurgle.  I actually remixed you beating off the burrito.  I saw that.  Because I was so pissed off yesterday.  I decided to fucking do a remix of you masturbating a burrito.  Why did you get a...  The Paris Hilton thing is just ridiculously stupid on so many counts. 
[00:05:30]  She was such a drip yesterday.  A drip.  She was a dud.  A dud-a-roo.  Ah, you're all wet.  And I, uh...  Go chase yourself.  And we're all shooting video and this and that, and I shot a little video, and I put  it up, and now that's a problem.  It's like...  So people are panicking and calling me, and I finally just fucking took it down for now.  Yeah.  But, I mean, we did nothing wrong yesterday.  It's out there in the cyber universe. 
[00:06:00]  This broad sucks.  We don't know why she's famous.  Yeah.  She's famous for being hot, but even that is questionable at this time.  Because I was the one that said that you guys are going to think she's stunning when  she walks through here.  She's all right.  I thought she looked good.  I really did.  But there's...  She's doing the plastic surgery and all that to try to hold on to...  Oh, yeah.  Her lips looked a little odd.  Oh, yeah.  Something was going on there.  And then she wouldn't take off those giant sunglasses.  Oh, yeah.  And, yeah, the attitude made her even less attractive. 
[00:06:30]  It's very odd how a fun girl can look a little better than she might normally, and then a shitty  attitude girl can all of a sudden not look as hot as she should.  But is she a fun girl?  Really study...  That's what I'm saying.  No, she's not.  She's not a fun girl at all.  That's what I'm saying.  Somehow...  She doesn't look as good because she's a fucking twat.  But she walks through life like, you know, everyone should kiss my ass because I'm so  hot and I'm so rich.  But she's not fun. 
[00:07:00]  I was studying videos yesterday.  I was looking at videos online and stuff going, what is the appeal here?  Her Simple Life show was really good because of Nicole Richie is a funny, funny girl.  She really is.  And now she's doing Simple Life without Nicole Richie.  And this is a stinkeroo.  It really is.  And I knew before the interview that the show sucked, but I was trying to be nice about  the whole thing going, let's see what we could get out of Paris Hilton.  And the one thing I got to say quickly is people are very confused by not only myself, but all 
[00:07:30]  of us, why we didn't completely just attack her and make her, I quote, and make her cry  and run out of here.  Yeah.  Honestly, the reason, and it's very simple, she did nothing to deserve us to go down that  road.  You know, maybe years and years ago we did some shit to people that didn't deserve it.  Yeah.  But for many years now, we don't do that unless they deserve it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was just a dud, a drip.  We couldn't get anything out of her.  So we're like, well, she'll make herself look bad here. 
[00:08:00]  We don't need to completely pull out our claws and rip her apart.  You know, the one thing that was annoying, though, was when she turned to our publicist.  Oh, yeah.  We always fucking hate that.  That was really fucking, like, that was the absolute turning point of, wow, this is just  really, this just went from a boring interview, pulling teeth with this fucking bitch, to, all  right, now there's a problem.  What I hated was that she was so dumb.  She didn't understand the questions she was getting were really good questions in that 
[00:08:30]  when someone says to you, look, you went to jail, how did that change you?  That's not reaching a conclusion.  That's not a challenge, like, literally is, it happened to come up.  I didn't plan on asking that, but you can say, you can answer that however you want.  That wasn't a pin you in the corner question.  That was a legitimate question, and she could have really made herself seem good there, but  she's a dummy.  It's on the first episode of a reality show.  She's doing community service because she had a problem. 
[00:09:00]  The rumor was cocaine, by the way, okay, that's why I did this little sniff thing during  the interview.  Yeah.  I mean, of course we're going to bring it up, and of course we're going to bring up  Lindsay Lohan and Kim Kardashian and the rest of them, because Paris Hilton kind of started  that trend.  These women that are famous for, we don't know why.  I don't know why Kim Kardashian's famous.  I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't define it, but I know she is.  She's ridiculously famous.  Lindsay Lohan, at this point, I don't know why she's famous. 
[00:09:30]  It's not because she's been doing movies at any time recently.  And I don't think she's even famous because she did a few movies in the past.  Like Herbie?  Well, Mean Girls kind of put her over the top.  Yeah.  But that's many years ago at this point.  Yeah.  So why is she still famous is the question.  From scandal.  Right.  Well, and then you got the person that kind of started sitting two inches from Jim Norton,  so you wanted to get into it a little bit.  And she's old hat now as far as the whole scandalous, entitled, bitchy Hollywood thing. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Like she's the old one.  She's irrelevant.  One guy tweeted me yesterday, and I wish I saved it for today's show.  He said it all.  He said something like, how do you interview a person about a reality show that doesn't want to talk about the reality show  and then doesn't want to talk about anything else going on in her life?  And then he just writes, and you could tell he was exasperated for us. 
[00:10:30]  He's like, how do you even do that?  Yeah.  As you guys.  How do you even do that?  That was just it.  Like when she started going, I want to talk about Lindsay Lohan, this, that, that.  Which, by the way, I just brought up to, you know, because it was the whole lifestyle issue.  Yeah, and she was giving us nothing.  And again, she's too stupid to realize that I wasn't asking her to give me any, you know, dish anything about Lindsay Lohan.  I was talking about that whole thing we have in society, this fascination with scandal and whatnot.  But she's much too stupid to realize that. 
[00:11:00]  So then it's like, all right, let's talk about the show then.  I was willing to go, okay, let's talk about your show.  It's really great.  It's nuts.  It's just, it's crazy.  What's nuts about it?  What's nuts?  Tell us then.  Right.  Give us something.  She couldn't even do that.  So at that point, you're just left with nothing.  It was like a Roland movie.  It was like a Roland movie review.  Yeah, yeah.  Suspense.  Friday-wide.  Funny.  Friday-wide.  Huge.  Hijinks. 
[00:11:30]  Antics.  And I guess.  Hilarity ensues.  I guess this drip.  I love using old school words.  A drip.  This drip.  A dud.  She kept using the word huge because I think she's trying to get the whole country to go,  ah, it's huge.  Another catchphrase, like it's hot.  It's huge.  It's, yes, I guess they had it's hot, right?  Oh, that's hot.  During civil life.  So, because she tried to squeeze, thank you, Danny.  She kept saying huge.  She kept trying to push that word.  I noticed that, too.  I didn't know why.  She wants everyone to walk around now.  Ah, that's huge.  But it didn't, it didn't.  Go fuck yourself.  It didn't catch on. 
[00:12:00]  No.  Oh, no.  And then, I mean, when these dopey celebrities that have seen and done a lot have to turn  around to a publicist with that help me look, she's.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  What I hated was she was so imperceptive.  And that bothered me.  And so not perceptive.  She's no ability to joke about herself or laugh about herself.  We weren't even going after her.  If I was going to go after Paris Hilton, you would have known it.  Or if you were going to go after her, it wasn't about that. 
[00:12:30]  But she's not likable.  She really is a hateable person.  My uncomfortable laughter was because I was really trying to hold back.  It was killing me.  It was.  I wanted to do some kind of atom bomb.  I really did.  I was stupefied as to where to go with that.  But then it was interesting to me.  It was like, wow, this is, she is, she has nothing.  And she is.  Nothing.  She is famous around the world.  And she comes in here and had nothing.  Nothing.  She was out there.  You could tell she didn't want to do this interview.  She was talked into doing radio in general.  She looks down at radio, which frustrates the fuck out of me because we've been at this 
[00:13:00]  game a long time.  And we've proven to a lot of people that radio could be way better than what you perceive  it to be.  And she's ordering like breakfast out there when it's so obvious, look, we're ready for  you.  The door was open.  I think Kenny had his arm like this way, ma'am.  Like it was so obvious.  It was time to enter the studio.  She's just sitting out there trying to figure out what she wants for breakfast.  Like her shit don't stink.  Then she comes in here with the glasses on, just kind of, she literally like puts herself 
[00:13:30]  down, like flopped in the chair, in the chair, like, all right, with no energy, didn't bring  anything in to talk about, even though it's her, her show.  Right.  Yeah.  That was just, uh, she, she hated me more than, than you guys.  And I could sense that from my first question.  She did not like me.  And again, I don't think it's possible, but she wasn't going to like anyone, Jimmy, but  I really, uh, it was just that you were first.  I was not nice to her on my HBO special.  And I'm sure she didn't, I, I didn't remember that I even talked about her and I happened 
[00:14:00]  to click and I, I don't watch monster.  I haven't seen monster.  I would spin out really.  Oh, but there was a, I don't think she did either, but there was a clip clip on there  where I'm really not very kind.  Uh, and I don't, do I think she remembered?  No, but justified.  She really, would I like to think that Paris Hill knows who I am and who we are?  Yes.  Uh, the reality, there's no fucking way she knows us.  I don't, I don't really need to think that she knows who I am.  I just, the reality was, I was wondering, I sensed that she didn't like me when she sat 
[00:14:30]  down and she didn't want to come in here.  I sensed she didn't like us when she was outside the window, outside the studio.  She's in a world of, uh, yes people.  And you know, she does, she doesn't know what's going on in the rest of the world.  This is Norton from his HBO, uh, special.  Why don't you want, this was great.  Okay.  This is Paris Hilton and her sex video, uh, from Jim Norton on HBO.  Paris Hilton deserves to be a sex symbol.  Cause she had sex, had the decency to film it and sell it. 
[00:15:00]  And I appreciate that.  I respect that.  Even though it was that awful green light that they used to catch Mexican sneaking into  Texas.  but she was a good lay that should be a requirement to be a sex symbol in this day and age we should  have to see you fuck who knows what marilyn monroe is like she might have been awful she  might have grabbed dimaggio's balls and just smashed it like  paris hilton was wonderful she took rick solomon's big old dick with a big hilton h behind her how 
[00:15:30]  do you not love that shaming mother and father i would have respected her more if she did it in  a ramada and that would have been a great fuck you to the family and these beds are so comfy  that's a great bit now i totally forgot that existed oh god now she says that um the sex tape 
[00:16:00]  ruined her life but the sex tape also just pushed her forward it made her it took her in a stratosphere  it absolutely ruins a politician's life not a fucking entitled uh debutante right it doesn't  ruin her fucking life she's trying to make a whole career based on the fact that she gets in her 
[00:16:30]  underwear and dances around at these fucking parties no one else is allowed into right and and a sex  tape is gonna hurt that right what does she do right i don't fuck you i just fuck you it's  infuriating with some of these people that have absolutely no talent yeah creativity anything going  for themselves and they're ridiculously famous she has nothing you should watch the kardashians that  show is mind-boggling yeah the sisters the sisters sit around and they're on their fucking uh 
[00:17:00]  iphones the entire show they film it and and it's doing millions and millions of fucking views  and an exasperated uh fucking bruce jenner just walks around i don't know what to do as a father right  he was an olympic champion yeah and they don't and they don't even give him respect yeah they sit around  and just look at their fucking phones and and have sex with black guys and and they're they're  monsters they're monsterly famous yeah you gotta sit and really watch because it drives me nuts i've 
[00:17:30]  seen i'm not even gonna lie i've watched that one like a few times and then you got the mother who's  had so much fucking plastic surgery and she she wants to be one of the daughters yeah she wants to  be famous herself for what though i don't even know what she does poor bruce jenner and his burn victim  wig oh god it's terrible but he looks awful he's had all that fucking surgery done but then you get  one of these uh um girls or people in here this is the point i'm making and you this is what you see 
[00:18:00]  this is we saw the real paris hilton she wasn't she wasn't tired or hung over that's what you really  get yeah nothing nothing absolutely nothing an empty vessel uh the phone's just lit i'm gonna start  from the top and move my way down bill t well people have mr chetley is that you people have  great observations from yesterday david in texas hate him what's up what's up david i just wanted 
[00:18:30]  to say that uh when you told roland to but uh super glue his butt cheeks together  he was implying that he might get a dick in his ass yeah the old in and out cube yes you never know  with the gays you never know you never know man uh you know roland is just a sexy guy roland is a dish 
[00:19:00]  to certain members of the gay community he's a big bear gays are very unpredictable you never know man  you go in there to try to discuss the situation next thing you know you're bent over a counter  well next thing you know roland's asking to be reassigned right yes he's fleeting people i could  get you guys uh we would laugh our asses off if roland was squealing like a pig that's for sure  but uh we should get into that what the fuck is out cube getting involved for we have we have shown  nothing but respect for guests in general since moving to this building so for them to just attack 
[00:19:30]  us like they did yesterday paris hilton after our interview decided she can't do any interviews  because we berated her and that's and that's why that was important to to leave that video up for a  while so you could see for yourself that we weren't berating her we couldn't have been nicer and then  she walked out she needed some excuse to get rid you know get out of all the rest you want to just  probably go home because she knew she was in way over her fucking head it's getting good reviews the 
[00:20:00]  show yeah i'm no kidding what where are we at with the lq guys have they apologized i don't know  this someone told me that didn't this is where we can't really listen to listeners someone told me  that they didn't mention us by name um i don't know they were very annoyed or whatever but the guy  larry twittered something but larry i twittered something back um i didn't twitter anything nasty  yet i did twitter that i wish those i said that they were assholes they didn't listen to the tape first  but to him directly i just twittered that uh you should listen to the tape but then he took his 
[00:20:30]  thing down so maybe he heard it or whatever yeah but it's like you know i've certainly flown off the  handle before well yeah of course you know when we first moved here it was weird between us and  those guys but you know sexual tension yeah exactly fast forward two years we were getting along with  these guys so for them to quickly jump to a conclusion like that's ridiculous i haven't heard what  they said either so i have to be fair i haven't well obviously something i mean when you know  when enough of our listeners get a hold of us with something like that something went down by the way 
[00:21:00]  the listeners that are tweeting paris hilton i would never encourage you to do so because it's  really apparently it's really upsetting her yeah so you probably shouldn't because uh she i she  reads her twitter and it's like it's bothering her and i don't want to see her upset any further  by this whole uh brouhaha oh yeah you know she reads every single one of them she just landed  in madrid so she'll be boring another country today is that how long flight that is i guess  god i was listening to a song yesterday i couldn't concentrate a song that was made up for her that's 
[00:21:30]  a good song she has nothing to do with that song i love it you hear how drew boogie in a couple  hours made you sound good i'm a good singer though that's what i won shower performer of the year  let's say hi to ken in jersey ken hey guys oh by the way everyone's saying how cute didn't mention  us by name oh okay there you go and each individual hold on a minute hold on ken uh striker quickly  yeah um when you guys were talking to roll and i turned over to out cue for a while 
[00:22:00]  to see what they were saying and a lot of the listeners were calling in defending you guys  and they went after each one of you guys because some of the listeners were trying to think  well you know i listen out to you occasionally too and they're like oh you don't listen to us  if you listen if oh and they knew that you listen to us that they would that they would call you and  you know going off on this and they pretty much were you know they named each one of you guys and said  that you were no better than any of the people who were calling to defend you that you guys were just 
[00:22:30]  you stopped i still want to that's too vague i want to hear the uh tape i want to hear actually  did they did any one of them think i was cute i'm off the subject  do what i'll tell you this much you know i i i yeah we got to hear exactly yeah i really should  hear it but were they hinting that we're not to like gay friendly or something like that because  you know we're so gay well some of the listeners i did see one of the half our bits these days are  gay bits i'm gay friendly trust me okay friendly relax i've been defending gays on television since

[00:24:00]  bring up lionel richie's big clay head from the hello video and and that isn't a a way to move on  uh then i'm i'm lost no that was great and who was the one who asked her reminded her that she  left her phone it was an instinct when she walked out oh yeah i said it when she walked out but it was  like i saw it it was just but dude what do you can't go through her phone that's like i don't  know i thought you were faking it one of those things hey you dropped oh no so did i i thought 
[00:24:30]  so no but i was just instinct i saw the phone it was like your phone it would have been beautiful  no kidding if we had five minutes of that that might be is that a crime to go through something  that one we would probably get in shit for of course we would oh we would have gotten shit but you  know hey what about uh i don't know where the phone is but ken's point like she couldn't even go  with the clay head thing you know what i mean yeah go with the clay head go with it  exactly yeah uh let's say hi to jay in jersey jay yo what's up all right right listen uh you know 
[00:25:00]  what maybe maybe you guys uh just don't have any original questions for paris maybe she's already  answered all these you know what i mean gotta keep it interesting for paris yeah right she uh i think  i asked her pretty hold on so you're panicking we're discussing something i don't even know if  he's goofy i don't care if he is or not i think the fact that that's the beauty of it he said  something that i can now i can now uh stand on a platform about the questions i was giving her  were good ones because they weren't condemnation questions but they were more it's like you want 
[00:25:30]  people you want a male demo to be interested in your show then you have to be interesting on a  different level than just hi and be cute she did the same thing to letterman though so it's not  personal she just stinks like she was terrible on letterman do you remember that she was so awful  on him and he blasted her yep so it's like we're not the only ones i mean letterman on tv had to deal with  this because she's a because she's a dummy she might be smart business wise but as far as  questions are concerned not smart you can't give her any leeway she's not smart business wise either 
[00:26:00]  how does lionel richie's clay head have its own twitter called lionel richie's clay head especially  he's on no fingers you know what the first tweet was what hello uh let's say hi to richie in  manhattan richie a lot of comments coming in about yesterday loves your comic book richie  hey good morning boys how are you hello hi rich hey uh and i love when you know she's going all  about i run 17 companies and you were like stop yeah yeah i couldn't i'm not gonna buy into the fact 
[00:26:30]  that she knows what it's like to work a day in her life a rich fucking debutante from the hilton family  it really really she earned it all and went out and did you're full of shit the beauty of the video  that now we just got a kind of reference because you can't see it anymore all those yeah whatever  there's a million copies out there oops uh hold on hold on but when aunt said that like stop in the 
[00:27:00]  video you see the public go no no no she really no she works no she did she she did all that it was a  great moment because the public is like no no she's telling the truth here no are you fucking  kidding me it's like she came in college she comes from a rich family yeah that's what billionaire  daughters get they get everything handed to them and then maybe technically she's she is involved  with companies she doesn't do the day-to-day work she started out on the in the basement she wasn't 
[00:27:30]  good enough to be a she was a model but she wasn't you know no a supermodel no hey boys you know that  you know it's the first word when i was listening that when the first word came out of her mouth i  knew that that interview was going to be an abortion yeah i i felt that we were on a bus and the last  stop was dud city pull the cord dudville dud city yeah she was the mayor of dud city running for her  third consecutive term she always wins hands down my landslide uh let me say say hi to dave in jersey dave 
[00:28:00]  hey good morning boys happy birthday jimmy jimmy i was hoping so bad that after she signed your  picture you ripped it up right in front of her or when you said or when he said you know i'd love to  have this get this signed but i've already bothered you enough and she goes oh no no no i'll find it  all fine you just went that don't worry about it i wish you ripped up the picture oh it was very  sarcastic though yeah i that was the one and believe me i'm a celebrity fool as everybody knows but 
[00:28:30]  that was the one i've done that really was done sarcastically i didn't expect her to do it and  then she writes hot you're hot you're hot and it was like yeah but to me that's almost how delusional  she is like you can't even be like do you first of all do you really think that i don't know hey i'm  mediocre on my best day in i'm on a one to ten right now hold on sir i'm i'm sir hold on who doesn't  know when people are pausing i'm uh i'm i'm maybe a five but in that picture with her i'm possibly 
[00:29:00]  less than a two and a half i'm fucking frumpy my hair is all over there's gray on it no one  thinks i'm hot in that picture it's like how delusional are you that you think i would believe  that or that you would write that she probably writes that on every picture of course there's  nothing real about that's what annoys me um yeah thank you though oh shit i had ripping up the  picture would have been too aggressive and like again you were right she didn't do anything to  deserve being attacked she was just a shitty interview and and people a few people and fair 
[00:29:30]  enough you got your opinions uh you know whatever we all do right like assholes that old  but a few people wrote on twitter yesterday that uh oh now you guys are uh being all brave and  stuff the fact is even after the interview we were frustrated by it we were going to move on  yeah what started us really attacking was after she left kenny was outside and somebody else and  they heard her say uh and i quote i'm not going to sit there and be berated berated yeah no one was 
[00:30:00]  berating her does she even know what the definition of that word she probably wanted her hair berated  or she was going to the islands i'm sure the interview will be played a couple times on this  channel this weekend listen for yourself we didn't berate her no we couldn't have been nicer  under this uh circumstances maybe compared to an entertainment tonight interview but it's almost  like you really don't understand if you were going to be berated you would really know you're being 
[00:30:30]  berated the best was we couldn't get anything out of her and then jimmy goes okay then we'll just  talk about the show so tell us about the show and then she's like hijinks skydiving crazy  it's unpredictable crazy what are we supposed to do with that she was really uninteresting  uh let's see  there's so much shit coming in uh okay uh let me say hi to ryan in the bronx ryan 
[00:31:00]  good morning boys hey hi ryan what's so annoying it's like yesterday you feel like oh do you do  you have a drink you're there no i'm growing up now i'm growing up now you're fucking 30 years old  what do you mean you're growing up now well yeah she's 30 which was also pointed out when we kind  of called her on it uh i think i said you you're annoyed you sound annoyed and she goes no it's just  what did she say it's early or something it's early and then everyone on the video on in the comments 
[00:31:30]  is like the clock said 9 45 and and if she's saying that you know she's grown up and she's  running 17 companies and she even said that she gets up early because she's got so much right on  her plate yeah and then and then have time to drink she doesn't have time for anything and then she  turns around and goes i'm not in a bad mood it's early and the clock says 9 45 for a businesswoman  that's pretty late in the morning right yeah i'm all grown up now only the only way she can get  males to watch that show if she did it naked with a sports sticker running on the bottom of it  what if she was revealing dude if she was literally guys would give it a shot if there 
[00:32:00]  was something different about it than they had come to know like if she had some personal insight  and was being honest like you just reality tv is so despicably predictable now there's none of it  is just the truth about somebody's uh what's going on what's going on with them and uh the show  450 000 viewers total total 180 viewers uh under 35 in the demo and really didn't didn't crack the  top 100 and cable show cable yeah that is it's terrible and was it beat out by uh airing of 
[00:32:30]  white chicks and uh and everyone everybody hates chris a rerun of everybody is chris i think the uh  i think a rerun of that by the way i think the uh the henry uh blake was killed episode of mash  reran and did better with her target demo of females i don't believe mackerel yeah not a lot of  16 year old girls watching the henry blake was killed over the sea of japan harris spun into the  sea of japan there were no viewers 
[00:33:00]  that's a great one oh god she's awful you've done your job captain just wants to do a mako impression  you're welcome folks we got larry larry hello what's up larry larry hello well gentlemen uh i think you're  really mismanaged the paris interview especially the aftermath and and the reason i say this is 
[00:33:30]  because she's so fake and false all that partying you talked about she did she's paid to go to those  places so that she appears there you have the pop the the paparazzi are reprehensible but they're  her stock and trade because they keep her in the news if she's ignored then her alleged brand  disappears and she's had no heat of any kind for so long now and i and i would think she was even  paid for the split beaver shots that she gave to the paparazzi so that her brand was hot 
[00:34:00]  the sex tape she's playing to the camera she knows she's being photographed she knows she's being  filmed she did she said she didn't know um that it was going to be released i may believe that i don't  know if i believe her on that one that's a possible but everything else you're saying i think sounds  very accurate yeah i mean so her entire life has been entitled and and and don't even know i don't  think you should have jumped down her throat and i think you handled that part well where i think the 
[00:34:30]  real screw-up came with the aftermath because you had an opportunity the worst thing that can happen  to her is to be ignored that's what she's been having done she's pretty much been ignored which has just  got to be frustrating and infuriating but larry one of the one i know larry didn't interrupt you i'm  sorry buddy but one of the things and i'm not saying you're wrong philosophically but it we we run  on emotion sometimes and we were all angry and if we don't react and say how we're feeling and deal  with it the audience knows that we're being full of shit and they're all feeling it with us this is 
[00:35:00]  not like a type of thing like a news tease where we can just go okay off to the weather well you know  you guys know us and you knew we were annoyed and you guys would have killed us we did at least admit  yeah of course we're annoyed you knew we were we certainly were we're going to talk about the  interview after the fact but then what ramped it up was finding out that she thought she couldn't  possibly actually think this that we were berating her exactly that's when we were like what and  that's why it went to level fucking uh 10 and even after that it didn't get that crazy we were just 
[00:35:30]  like we're just annoyed right well that aftermath i understand that what i was saying when you  screwed up and i i maybe didn't didn't make myself clear and i apologize for that because i think you  didn't go far enough you had an opportunity to save your viewers if they were the least bit curious  about this turd on tv to explain exactly what you were going to see and save them the trouble  by blowing up her show this is what happens this is how she deals with the lady who writes porn 
[00:36:00]  and that would have what i gave away what with that it might have damaged your relationship  right by going too far there was nothing really to talk about as far as the show goes i did blow up  one of the spots because they hinted that she's having problems with her boyfriend and somebody  asked i think it was anthony about you know do you have a boyfriend whatever and she said it's going  really well we've been together a year and a half and we're still together and i said oops i get you  know no reason to watch the show anymore because we know that uh you're still with them you know  because the show's been taped already right oh i understand but that attempted humor just fell 
[00:36:30]  flat on that humorless uh thing yeah she she didn't have any type of self-awareness with humor  and maybe it's a comic that's expecting too much from somebody who is not a you know who's just a dud  she has this image that she's a fun party she's really not going with the flow type of girl the fact  is she doesn't understand humor she barely has a fucking brain and a thought in her in her in her head  but i like that bitch's long tootsies i want to suck on tootsies how do you not go with the 
[00:37:00]  lionel richie thing that's a very safe one it has nothing to do with anything right but i think it's  because she has a problem with nicole richie so she doesn't want to talk about nicole richie  and she absolutely has a problem with kim kardashian because she i said it she she introduced the world  to kim kardashian now her gig and now kim yeah kim took her gig very good and kim kardashian is huge  but she doesn't get in trouble does she kim she's just like she's had her own fucking thing but  paris hilton is absolutely not friends with kim kardashian when you say i wish her well that means 
[00:37:30]  you don't like the person and you're just trying to be cool about it she's frustrated by kim kardashian's  success and now she's trying to do the exact same thing with this reality show oh yeah and it stinks  and it's nowhere near the kardashian show which i think sucks yeah because they they're actually people  and much more interesting although i've never seen any of their shows and i wanted to ask your opinion  on one more thing how much do you think cnn paid her and then she was so resentful of not only having  to get up early in the morning but do you guys for nothing do they pay her cnn i don't know where 
[00:38:00]  that's at these days i mean there's always rumors that uh people get paid for interviews but then  yeah then they say they don't get paid but then people say well but they get taken care of  where they get put up in nice hotels and dinners and this and maybe yeah it's very it's a very shady  shady thing that is going on that we don't really understand to be honest with you yeah i the rumor  i heard the rumor i heard for the cnn was that she was paid uh seven hats seven hats yes seven hats 
[00:38:30]  and four felt and three of an uh indeterminate cloth well i mean cnn that shows in the tank their  ratings are in the tank and he's not generating any heat now and they got her and her mother  yeah well i but the the the new show that's the new uh guy who's got the big show on cnn  um is supposed to be getting a lot of no it's a tanking and that had to have been a hot interview  for him to get and then they have all those topics talked about i think that stuff no no no i don't i 
[00:39:00]  don't know if i believe that i think that any publicist in the world would go you have to do  this interview i know i don't i doubt that's a pain pierce morgan at this point uh paris  i'm answering your question larry if you really want to listen all right i think at this point  paris needs cnn more than cnn needs paris okay she's trying to reinvent herself and it's gonna  fail fucking miserably she's trying to tell the world she's not a partier anymore she's 30 and  she's got all these businesses it's not gonna work i'm sorry the world is not gonna accept that 
[00:39:30]  they want to see her fucking snatch until uh before it starts drying up you know what movie i watched  in honor of our interview yesterday uh forget paris oh shit oh shit swim walk after that one  after that joker oh good one yeah that's what you do after a home run you swim walk what's some of  those other paris movies i don't know that's the only one i know i know the hottie and the naughty 
[00:40:00]  seriously what seriously the hottie and the naughty the hottie and the naughty oh are they phone  descriptions i think there is a couple pink panther ones that were filmed in paris he has a good  boy phone and a naughty boy phone that's jamaican french oh wow uh someone is writing a capital  letters uh scoop says if you go online there's nothing in the news about paris hilton and opie 
[00:40:30]  anthony yeah because it wasn't it wasn't an event in the end no it wasn't no because it literally was  it was it was quiet there was no yelling there was no get out fuck you there's none of that if  she walked off or or we told her to get the fuck out or if she ran out of here crying and yeah then  we'd be all over the place we chose not to do that and you know how easy it would have been for us to  get our fucking names all over the place one lousy question it was boring right i was gonna say  you're full of turkey that's right wow that would have been the headline easy so i guess they're i guess 
[00:41:00]  that's where we're at yeah that's where i would dad phones really blow up though they're still  blown up uh see seems to have everything handed to her that's why she's such a shitty personality  yeah of course yeah she's never worked a hard day in her life saying she runs 17 and then the  publicist once again yeah yeah no that's true yeah that's true she really no she worked she worked  for her her whole life and she did not shut up no maybe going to the clubs and this and that she's 
[00:41:30]  probably made a few mil at this point oh she is but her family's worth billions she never had to work  no and then because of that money and she was able to set up stuff that none of us would be able to  ever set up for ourselves no and i would love to know how many fucking companies have failed  yeah and how many were you know actually she worked for without any input of money from her family right  building it herself right stop it okay good example i'm i'm part owner of a restaurant on long island 
[00:42:00]  yeah i have nothing to fucking do with it you don't go in there and i eat like anyone else cook the food  you don't go down to to the to the dock and pick the fish right and and i'm sure she has that  situation where she is part owner of of some some ventures yeah but has nothing to fucking do with it  and then she sits here and takes credit that she runs 17 companies that means i run fh riley's 
[00:42:30]  that's that's bullshit yeah  she was trying to make huge her catchphrase yeah we we discussed that yeah it's terrible good luck  with that good luck with that she shows on that rick solomon's penis that would have been accurate  good old rick uh let's see i guess that's it i mean maybe she's smarter than you give her credit  for she's not smart really let's see let's hear this bit of wisdom at it uh doug in illinois doug  morning boys hey i you a hole once hey maybe 
[00:43:00]  it's just wow nice one jimmy thank you that was all that was a double off the wall good  hey maybe it's that she knows that you guys are going to create controversy  no everyone's ignoring her ass and if she goes on your show and nothing happened but she still  walks off that she gets her name out there because the big bad radio jocks berated her 
[00:43:30]  nah dude she was too i i have to cut you off it she was a dud she wasn't controversial  well i know but she had to do something so she goes on a controversial show which is yours  and it's not controversial and she's going to try to use you guys to get her name out  she would have said something controversial there's nothing wrong with your point but it  just uh that's just not what was happening yeah i mean when she looked at her publishes she public  says she's like what the fuck i just want a dumb fluff interview like anyone else would give me and  move on but she didn't even give us that and we weren't even going uh you know controversial or 
[00:44:00]  hardcore we try we tried if she would have said something crazy like i hope that the hope that  donald drops pizza on his lap whoa easy she's truly a dead end fucker a dread city the mayor of  dud city a drip she really is what's the definition of a drip a billionaire heiress who can't answer  one honest question about herself you could if you're on twitter you could call her a drip a drip

[00:48:00]  flop today she is a flop her show's a flop a dud and a flop needs to be used on twitter today and  there's a funny review not i guess we gotta move on from drip unfortunately in one of the papers that  says something about just it's bashing some romantic comedy and it just says it's a rom-com  bomb and i just think that's a bomb is a very funny word when you really think about how awful it  is to have your project yeah be a bomb nobody wants to bomb you don't want to bomb well how 
[00:48:30]  was uh how was bill not good he was bombing on opening night nobody wants to bomb on opening  night he was bombing in that flop of a play oh that play was a dud it was a monumental bomb  what a flop hey uh this is the review you were saying then we'll move on from yahoo tv  paris hill wants you to like her really the starlet and paparazzi target has a new reality show the aim 
[00:49:00]  of the show is clear to change paris's image and make her a more likable celebrity that is not going  to happen whatsoever this is going to fail miserably good luck uh unfortunately for paris that goal might  be more lofty than she initially thought according to early reviews the billionaire barbie comes off  as a bit of a jerk and that's what we thought yesterday and we we weren't filming a reality show  a bit a bit of a jerk on the oxygen series and then it goes on and on blah blah blah so 
[00:49:30]  all right i guess we're done with that wait there's something you said shit you made me think of  something drip more like no no more likable um oh i don't remember but she really just isn't nice  oh she's trying to change her image that maybe um some people could change their image she's that  it ain't happening george foreman but she doesn't have the personality to change her no she's awful  she is what she is yeah she is uh a dud she's a real stick in the mud  that's a stick in them i don't know why in the mud yeah how did that become like something that's

[00:57:30]  happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear aids  happy birthday to you 30 years young aids  wait a minute you know you got no complaints  aids 30 30 years old they say aids they do have a case dating back to the 60s though yeah 
[00:58:00]  yeah well that probably wasn't real aids it was easy enough it was easy enough and uh they're  saying that guy was a guy in san francisco cured of the aids through stem cell research so yeah but i  want to i want to see what that guy looks like yeah yeah what are you thinking his feet fell off  right that's the price you pay he was walking and his feet just fell off like he was the  terminator being frozen they cured the aids huh yeah well that was that guy it was a bone marrow 
[00:58:30]  transplant i know they said uh on the news today that they got all the cocktails and stuff yeah if  you have hiv it's not as big of a deal as it was when you were getting the aids in the 80s you could  live an entire life of uh you know an average lifespan without ever getting aids and without it affecting  you aside from the fact that you got to you know take a fucking tanker full of expensive drugs  every day was that stem cell that got that yes they said stem cell uh for the guy in san francisco  and the guy in san francisco and has no sign of uh of the eights and this is where you think magic 
[00:59:00]  johnson got that shit maybe early on believe he's on the way to that guy's house right now  asking for bone marrow but you gotta wonder wonder about the magic johnson he's had it for over 20 years  now yeah way before the cocktails got really good yeah and they cured a guy in san francisco  did they you think with magic's money and his fucking power the people he knows  you know they already knew this shit was going on said look let's give this a try so give me what uh  what you got he was never affected by this experimented on him like the tuskegee airmen 
[00:59:30]  right or don't no not the airmen they were the tuskegee fucking whatever they were i mean the old  job shot him up with some viruses and shit tuskegee i always say tuskegee i can never say that i don't  think it was the tuskegee airmen they experimented on it was like other people from tuskegee  and they threw him a ball and gave him some planes to fly around shoot some nazis with  or something or magic themselves magic was the only guy that gained the fucking weight i know it's an  old oh yeah old joke but yeah everyone else losing weight rapidly and this guy actually gained weight 
[01:00:00]  yeah i would love to know that story something johnson that entrepreneur how do you think he got  what a brilliant guy show opening up shooting ranges and movie theaters in the same buildings  my uh my my philosophy that what i've heard and it may be completely incorrect is trannies  and certain tranny parties which who wouldn't go to a tranny party i challenge you they say most  aids cases these days are black male on male sex and uh more than half of the cases are black african 
[01:00:30]  americans really yep they love doing that uh ass fucking i think i guess huh i think because the  no i think it's because the black community you know they have to be on the down low on the dl  yeah it all comes down to education i don't think the black community accepts the the gay lifestyle  as much as other uh you know white counterparts whites and other other other such races it all comes down 
[01:01:00]  education uh i love these those birth control commercials that say you know the pill does not  uh protect against hiv and certain other sexually transmitted diseases it's like really does anyone  really have to be told that a fucking pill or a diaphragm or whatever the fuck you're putting in  there doesn't protect you against aids who's that stupid and why don't they already have the aids  but when you look like the education stuff like that about the drugs and fucking and and diseases  what groups want to fucking stop that what groups religious right want to stop the stem cells they 
[01:01:30]  they really make me sick yeah under the and it's all under this fucking blanket of religion it's this  religion thing where it's like we can't be doing that playing god doing you know the lord's work  shut the fuck up there is no god my name's fred i'm a man i'm a man like you that's why i want to  know where romney stands on like stem cell that's the the main thing i can't remember romney romney 
[01:02:00]  yeah that's the main thing i want stem cells romney's got kind of a presidential look to him he  definitely does yeah except for the chair he was in was too small yeah he needs a bigger chair he's  a bigger chair he's being scolded you always want to look presidential you got to be in the bigger  chair than uh the guy that's interviewing that's why i won't vote for him and hannity you should  know that you should never be lower than the guy you're interviewing and hannity wants to uh you know  put him over i guess you know because he doesn't want obama winning and it looks like he's going to 
[01:02:30]  be the front runner so hannity was actually slouching down in his chair a little bit i think to try to  come off because he knew smaller yeah it was pretty funny he fucked him but romney should be smart enough  to know that that that's that's not good we all learned that in fast times ridgemont high you put  someone in a in a in a kid's chair they look ridiculous she will have yeah exactly  so the aids is 30 the aids is uh 30 years young how is the aids celebrating its 30th birthday  i don't know what would aids do for take a vacation into a new asshole yeah 
[01:03:00]  what's it what he calls the tunnel of love the aids  oh we have aids stuff to play today of course we do aids what do you got let's do one please i love  that all right why don't we do one quick one for aids his birthday we got aids  oh yeah everyone has aids  so this is the end of our story 
[01:03:30]  and everyone is dead from aids  it took from me my best friend  my only true pal  my only bright star  well i'm gonna march on washington  lead the fight and charge the brigades  there's a hero inside of all of us  i'll make them see everyone has aids

[01:04:30]  okay fuck it  what's next  Oh  the aids song  God is that great  it is a good one  I heard uh  a lot of people crowing about the new South park episode  I don't know what it's about.  I don't know this episode.  I don't know what it does.  What is it about?  But I have no idea.  You don't even know the subject?  It's very funny.  E-Rock seems to be grinning like he knows.  Yeah.  He's like a Cheshire cat.  Cheshire means fat.  They explored.  Incompetence. 
[01:05:00]  Sorry, I stepped on that.  That's all right.  You didn't mean to your Cheshire.  Be sorry to step on anything.  I'm sorry I broke that.  It's all right.  It's my battleship floor.  Sorry, my foot went through that rotted wood.  That was actually stainless battleship steel.  It's gray.  You just broke old iron sides.  Jesus.  That's what happened on the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Young sweet boy running from the front of the deck to go back to get cookies. 
[01:05:30]  Cookies.  And his foot went right through the bottom of the ship.  And it began to sink.  And D-Rock was hungry.  He ran to the fridge.  Saying, fellas, he's too fat to feed you.  I'm sorry.  Poor sweet boy just wanted a lemon cookie.  And he ran and he tipped the Edmund Fitzgerald over.  And his foot went through the hole. 
[01:06:00]  Okay.  Iraq, you have a little comment on South Park?  Yeah.  They have the Chinese fighting the Japanese.  And they explore multiple personalities.  Oh, okay.  And I hear there's a lot of Chinese stereotype talking going on that we can't do.  And people get in trouble for.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I think we could do it here.  Well, here we can do it.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Regular radio.  They had a problem with the chinkies.  There's a clip.  I don't know exactly which clip it is.  Right?  I see Butters. 
[01:06:30]  Always funny.  Butters always funny.  Butters always funny.  Post-man Butters.  Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou.  Sometimes we sing that in the back.  I don't know.  I'll have to watch a commercial first, Brad.  I love a good commercial.  Or not.  I don't know.  Thank you, South Park Studios.  Hello, sir.  Post-man Butters with a special delivery for you.  What's this?  An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town.  Try their lunch specials.  Thanks.  You can count on Post-man Butters.  Special delivery, man. 
[01:07:00]  Here you are, sir.  Brand-new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you from Post-man Butters.  Oh, they're all crumbling them up and throwing them away.  Welcome to Shitty Walk.  Can I take an autoprase?  Hello, sir.  Post-man Butters here with a special delivery for you.  What are you talking about?  It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.  A what?  Let me see that.  Oh, no, a sushi price.  How come every time a hard-working Chinese man opened a business, 
[01:07:30]  some smelly Japanese dog had to come and try to invade him?  I don't know.  I'm just being paid to hand out flyers.  Where is this Japanese-a-toyant ball?  How far from my Shitty Walk?  You mean there's a sushi restaurant?  It's right over there.  What?  What?  What the f***?  It's right next door.  Right next door, it's Shitty Sushi.  Shitty, Shitty Sushi.  I think I watched most of this one because I think I fell asleep watching it yesterday. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  But there was a funny point where when the owner of Shitty Walk confronts the owner of Shitty Sushi,  there's kind of some miscommunication because they can't understand one another.  Oh, of course.  But they're talking exactly the same.  Of course they are.  But stupid John Lew is getting people fired over that s***.  Yeah.  I remember the name.  Yeah, cartoons are exceptional.  John f***ing Lew.  Not anymore.  He got elected to a real office.  Yeah, he's moving up in the ranks, which is terrific for everybody.  He doesn't have a sense of f***ing humor. 
[01:08:30]  No longer a council chap?  No, he's no longer one of those, you know, f***ing guys that go around b***ing about their race being s*** upon.  Yeah, because he has other s*** to do now.  Yeah, now he's got, you know, a constituency that involves people that can drive.  Ah, finally.  Shit like that.  Can drive.  Sounds like a new computer drive.  For all things Ken.  Wow.  What, do you want to bring it back to the dud conversation? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Hi, you have mail.  Oh, God.  I was going to tell you.  Hot teens, welcome.  You've got terrible news.  You've got a death in the family.  The Ken drive.  For all things Ken. 
[01:09:30]  Kenny.  Did Kenny wait for you yesterday outside?  No, no, but I went later.  I texted him.  No, we waited.  We waited for a while.  Because you were on the air.  Yeah, but I told him go.  Actually, when you said on the air, go, he said, he f***ing hit the gas pedal.  Did you have Jimmy making an appearance on the shit hour?  Yes.  After the show, I heard that on my drive.  I upgraded it to garbage.  Yes, it was the garbage show when you were on.  The shit hour is fun to do, man.  The shit hour.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Mike in Jersey. 
[01:10:00]  Mike.  A little mad at Jimmy about the stem cell thing.  Okay.  Mikey.  Hello, guys.  Yes, Mike.  On the show.  Jimmy, I love you, buddy.  Thank you.  For you to say all I care about is stem cells, that's crazy.  But I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that.  It's my main.  Of all the things that are happening right now, I think for human health and like the long  I think stem cells are the most important thing because those are the ones that are going  to put us to the next level as far as limb reproduction.  Like, you know what I mean?  It's a tremendous step in science. 
[01:10:30]  Should be backed and we should be all over this.  Yeah, dude.  They're going to be able to, for paralyzed people to walk, they're going to be able to  eventually cure cancer, AIDS.  It's like, to me, it's the key to a lot of fucking longevity.  No, I agree.  And they're doing stuff with it.  But I think, you know, if all of a sudden Romney comes out, look, I hate Palin.  I don't, God forbid she runs.  I'm a big Republican.  I think she's not going to run.  God forbid.  And, you know, and she is a coup.  But if all of a sudden Romney says, you know what, I'm against increasing funding for stem  cells, I just, you can't make that a blanket statement. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, you've got to look at the big picture.  I will make it, for me, I look at the big picture and I will take a liberal Democrat and  as much as I hate a lot of their tax policies, I hate their coddling of Islam, I hate a lot  of what they do.  Right now, I want stem cells funded.  All the money we fucking waste on a million different things, pick your waste, that's  something I want my tax dollars going for and I want that fucking funded because that's  eventually, I'm 42, that's, you know, 15 or 20 years from now, if they're really doing 
[01:11:30]  steady stem cell research, it's going to wind up helping me.  Of course.  So, I care a lot more about that than the fucking, than whatever other issues they're  having.  I care a lot more about that than whatever else they're doing.  And they're just taking the stem cells from duds.  Yeah, but that's where the conservatives totally lose me.  Jimmy, Jimmy, but nobody's going to be able to afford the virus tour if this economy goes  even further in the shit. 
[01:12:00]  I mean, if you include Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, we're about $70 trillion  in debt.  That is not being addressed.  I'm sure you're, I'm sure you're right.  The economy was shitty at the end of Bush's term.  It's shitty now.  I care more about stem cells being, being researched.  That's what I care about.  I mean, that to me is what I care about.  You need like checks and balances as far as the ideologies are concerned and the fucking  gays in the middle.  I'm sick of the conservatives on that level.  I agree with them with, with gun control. 
[01:12:30]  I agree with them on a lot of how they handle crime.  I agree with a lot of conservative tax things, but when it comes to the moralizing, I fucking  hate their guts.  I hear you.  I hear you.  That is true.  Yeah.  I love the show.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  I do hate the, uh, when they pour that fucking religious ideology into politics like that.  It's just fucking fun.  The fucking thing is it's obviously, uh, the next step, like you said, in, in human fucking  health. 
[01:13:00]  Absolutely.  Cures and all kinds of shit that was never imagined.  And, uh, yeah, they're just like, no, because God doesn't like it.  Really?  Yeah.  Does he?  Does he not like it?  Yeah.  He put that shit on this planet.  Everything's on this planet.  Yeah.  We should use whatever's on this planet.  Oh yeah.  For whatever purpose we need.  That's what I like.  Like, I cannot hear fucking religious people telling me why we can't use stem cells or  embryonic stem cells or whatever it is.  I don't care what they have to do. 
[01:13:30]  Sick of it.  That's just my take on it.  And that's why I would rather see Obama or a guy like Giuliani, who I think as a Republican  is more likely to fund that stuff.  Yeah.  Because he's not really a religious conservative, you know?  Well, that's what you need.  Somebody in there that's not a fucking religious nut.  Like, fucking Bush just had too much of that goddamn religion.  He hated it.  Fuck.  I wonder where he stands on stuff like that, Giuliani.  I should text him later.  I don't know.  I'm sure if it helps a fucking prostate, he's for it. 
[01:14:00]  Right?  Jesus.  Well, you do usually get behind the shit that could help you directly.  What's going to help Michael J. Fox or Alzheimer's?  It's probably going to be stem cell stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what they do with stem cells.  I don't know anything about them.  And I know you people are surprised if I wear my stem cell shirts all the time.  And I'm selling my stem cell wear shirts, hats shaped like stem cells.  And nobody knows what they look like.  So people are like, what's that hat?  You're like, it's a stem cell, cunt teeth.  Stem cell. 
[01:14:30]  You have to act like everybody knows what a stem cell looks like.  Can you put stem cell in Google Image?  Now I need to know what it looks like.  And I want to picture this on hats and t-shirts for Jimmy.  But you have to talk to the people like they're dumb and they don't know what it is.  Is that the image of stem cell?  God, that would make a cool shirt.  It's like blobby shit.  Yeah, it certainly does.  Well, it looks like a cell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the stems.  With dandruff in it.  I think they take your cell and they take a nucleus and fucking inject it into a cell. 
[01:15:00]  And it does magical things.  I know.  Whatever it does.  It's crazy.  Oh, we can't do that because why can't we?  Yeah, don't we all like magic?  Yeah.  I like magical things.  Give me a bowl of zygotes.  Fucking, I'll eat them.  Wienergate, where are we, man?  Anthony Wiener.  Oh, Anthony Wiener.  Is he going to survive this shit?  What's the latest now?  They're looking into where the picture was posted.  I know it was Twitter, but they have various hosting. 
[01:15:30]  Y-Frog.  Was it on Y-Frog?  I use the Y-Frog now.  Me too.  Because lockers suck to dick.  Anyone using that lockers thing can go, I will not click on a link when I see lockers  with a dumb ad.  And then I'm like, I can't find the picture sometimes.  Like, where's the fucking picture?  I'm staring at an ad.  I'm trying to scroll, scroll, scroll.  It ain't scrolling.  Lockers are stupid.  I hate lockers.  Well, Twitter's getting involved, right?  They're going to finally start hosting pictures.  Hosting their own pitches.  Yeah, instead of the second party shit, third party shit, whatever it's called. 
[01:16:00]  Lockers sucks a dick.  I use the Y-Frog.  I like Y-Frog.  Yeah, but it's still his picture, right?  Yeah.  I don't think he's...  So that's extremely suspicious.  He hasn't come out and said, it's not my picture yet.  But he said...  Oh, I'm sorry.  But it's like, where was it posted?  Did somebody then find it in his secret stash and post it?  Uh, that's another thing.  This is... 
[01:16:30]  I agree.  Yeah.  No, no, it's okay.  I'm just...  No, because I'm just babbling.  No, you're not.  But I agree with the whole thing about this picture is probably somewhere, a lot of places.  And he can't tell it, because all he had to say was, yeah, it's a little bit of a photo  I took from my wife, and it got hacked and posted.  All right, maybe that's not for everybody, but it's my wife and I was...  Whatever.  And people could not argue that.  But if you take kind of a picture for your spouse, that's acceptable in most circles. 
[01:17:00]  And nobody could blast you for doing that if you genuinely were hacked and it was taken  out of that.  But there's something else.  It's probably in other places.  And his wife probably has no idea.  Yeah.  He's been...  My opinion, so I don't get in trouble, he's been moving this picture around for a while.  There we go.  Then he did something...  He had some kind of oopsie.  But...  Sorry, just distracted by Hayden Planetarium.  Hayden Planetarium.  This is hot.  Yeah, I like her.  Doesn't she kind of look like a gymnast?  No, she...  I like her a little bit. 
[01:17:30]  Do you?  Yeah.  Not like a...  Like, whoa!  I know.  I mean, people wouldn't laugh at you for saying that.  I just think she kind of has a gymnast thing happening.  Yeah.  She's kind of squatty or something.  Yeah.  She's got a good look to her.  Yeah.  I heard she's a scaly clit.  I love a scaly clit.  Me too.  Dry and scaly.  Oh, no, I meant I could stand on it.  It tells me how much I weigh.  Oh, that's different.  I like to put my cold feet on a clit. 
[01:18:00]  It tells me how heavy I am.  Boo.  So, what are they saying?  Is it his?  I don't know.  I'm kind of out of this one.  Look at her with the hula hoop.  Come on.  That looks great.  Let me see that picture.  Come on.  That's a great picture.  Look at that, right?  I didn't like that.  That's a while ago, though.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't she like a midget body?  She does have a little bit of a midget body thing.  She's got like short legs for her body, but I don't give a shit. 
[01:18:30]  She's legs, dick.  If they're wrapped around my face, I don't care, right?  Even if the ankles don't touch?  Even if they just wise straight out?  Two little fat chicken drumsticks?  Nice legs, retardo.  Wow, look at that fucking rump.  Almost looks like she has balls.  She probably has a big meat pussy.  I want to know how many times she's had to apologize for people tripping over her meat pussy.  Like how many times fancy waiters have spilled tea tripping over her meat lips. 
[01:19:00]  Sorry, I coughed and they fell out.  I guess we won't be hearing that she's booked on the show anytime soon.  Is it meat lips?  Whatever.  Meat lips.  You can't say...  You see the picture that was going around yesterday from the Miami Heat game?  Which one was that?  I missed that one.  I don't click on a lot of pictures.  Wow, she does have a meaty pussy.  Yes, she does.  Look at that.  Can you zoom in on that 500 times?  Looks like Anthony Wiener's underwear. 
[01:19:30]  Except it has a better bulge in it.  Yeah.  Holy shit, does she have a fucking fat one.  Yeah, that is.  I bet you zoom in on that, you're going to see some slit.  Yeah.  A little lip slit, as they call it, as I call it.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  Look, look, look.  A lot of meat there for you, Jimmy.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Nice, right?  That's a fat one.  You could absolutely Photoshop that to look like flesh.  Yeah.  And you would get a great shot at that.  Oh, man. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I can picture her squatting, like doing squat thrusts in the gym, and I'm laying on the floor  because, like, it's a new floor, and they said, look, a lot of, she's been tinkling all  over town.  Can you catch this?  All over town?  Maybe CBS was right to want to fire me.  This is not morning show material.  No.  Oh, God.  She's doing, she's doing bloody shit jokes at 507.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  It's hard to get drive time, people.  Yeah, I'm kind of fixated on her.  I'm still fixated on this Casey Anthony and her huge tits.  Kind of like that murdering liar.  Something about her.  Just something about her.  She was one of the topics last night, but we didn't get to her.  Yeah.  I would have to tread carefully with that one.  Oh, why?  Because of the baby murder?  Yeah.  Angle?  Yeah, yeah.  People don't like, people don't like jokes about that.  Love that. 
[01:21:00]  But baby murderers.  Yeah.  But, boy, I don't know.  Every time they, I watch the trial and I see the prosecution get up there and start,  you know, yesterday they were playing tapes of the police interrogation.  And the cop is just getting on her shit.  Like, you're lying.  You're lying.  You've done nothing but lie this entire time.  You've lied to your family.  You're lying to us.  Tell us the truth.  Where's Kaylee?  And she's like, I don't know. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know.  I dropped her off at the babysitter a month ago.  And I, so, so, like, she, she, why didn't you report her missing?  You're lying.  And you know what, though?  There's, yeah, she's a liar.  She's a piece of shit.  But I don't see the prosecution with any proof that she murdered the kid.  I believe she did.  Or, or, I think that something happened.  The kid died.  Whether she drowned in that pool or she was giving her Xanax to put her to sleep so she 
[01:22:00]  could go out at night and the kid died of some kind of accidental overdose or some shit.  I don't know.  But the prosecution's not, they're proving that she's a piece of shit.  But they're not proving murder.  You know what?  This might be one of those baby with the bathwater things, if I can.  Yes, yes, throwing out the baby with the bathwater and the duct tape.  She's such a piece of shit.  Yeah.  She deserves to be killed for being, whether or not, however this kid died, this woman 
[01:22:30]  is such a fucking pile of garbage.  Right.  That she should be put down like a sick animal.  But.  I don't even give a fuck if they prove it.  Right.  But that's graceful.  But that's the whole thing.  And believe me, the jury knows what you're supposed to base your opinion on.  When the judge gives his instructions to the jury, he tells them, look, this is a fucking  case that you're supposed to take the evidence. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  You have to.  Jim just shoved blueberries under his upper lip.  I have one.  You have a simian mouth now.  No, it's just, there's a birth defect.  It's called the cleft lip.  Blueberry lip, we call it.  You got to do blueberry teeth for the rest of the show.  I can't.  As you're trying to make really good points, just have blueberry skins all over your teeth.  He's making his mouth really small.  I just think that we have to weigh all the facts and you can't start thinking that you  know all the facts. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  That's all I was trying to say.  There'll be some outrage if she doesn't get a good sentence there.  No, I think if the jury.  And you're saying it's heading that way, huh?  I think if the jury really looks at just the facts, they'll at least get one juror or a  couple of jurors to maybe get this a hung jury, have to have it retried under maybe a lesser  charge of just manslaughter or even just fucking disposing of a body.  Um, I don't, but I'm not, I'm not seeing them proving murder here. 
[01:24:00]  They're having a very difficult time and the defense is throwing so much shit out there to  confuse the jury with.  Um, and they're supposed to know.  Look, and believe me, in closing arguments, you're going to see the defense attorneys come  out and bash the shit out of their client calling.  Yes, she's a liar.  Yes, she fucking lied about this.  She's a despicable person, but that isn't why she's on trial here. 
[01:24:30]  She's on trial for capital murder.  Now, did you hear the prosecution, uh, present a case where this woman should be put to death  for the murder of a child?  I don't think so.  But I think her not revealing what happened to the kid.  Yeah.  It could also, it's huge, but it is a big one.  It's a big one, but again, and they'll bring that up.  Is she going to testify?  Uh, that's the big question.  Will she take the stand and testify?  She won't.  A lot of times they don't. 
[01:25:00]  And she is so unlikable that, uh, I don't think, I don't think it would be a good thing.  Because she, she really has a way of shutting off any type of emotion.  Uh, she's very narcissistic.  Um, she doesn't show that she has any remorse or emotions for her daughter.  So if she gets up there and she's just straight face talking about her daughter and not, can  complete hysterics like the grandmother was, the jury's going to be like, look at this piece 
[01:25:30]  of shit.  I still think that you have to give her time though, because if she's not able to speak  for herself, who's going to speak for her?  It's like a lip goiter.  You have this giant lip goiter.  You ever see things where it's like, why, why don't they have that removed?  Like somebody with a giant bump on their head.  Why aren't you at the doctor right now having that removed?  I almost understand that.  Like maybe it's some kind of inoperable tumor.  What I hate are the big, over the top, horrible fucking moles with hair going on. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In this day and age, you can get that snip, no problem.  You gotta get rid of that.  And you might have a slight scar, but it's way better than this huge lump you got on your  face.  Didn't, uh, Iglesias, uh, have that taken care of?  Yes, he did.  He's a hero to a lot of people I know.  Enrique?  Yes, he did.  But that's not about that lip for my looks.  This is all about legalities.  Enrique Iglesias, you got no complaints?  No whatsoever.  So listen, I found the picture from the heat game.  It's very important. 
[01:26:30]  I'm telling you.  Congratulations to the Mavericks, by the way.  They had a huge fucking fourth quarter comeback, tying the series at one game apiece.  I know you don't care much, Ant, but I'm telling you, there's a lot of people out there  that don't want to see LeBron with a fucking ring anytime soon.  Well.  And, uh, Dallas came back out of nowhere yesterday.  Very good news.  Out of literally nowhere?  They just...  Nowhere.  They were down, like, 15 points in the fourth quarter, and they did it.  Uh, but I think this is from last night's game.  Uh, ball goes into the fucking stands, player goes after it, knocks everybody over. 
[01:27:00]  You've seen it before, right?  Uh-huh.  Sure.  And someone, uh, screen capped this from their TV yesterday.  So you got a girl...  It looks like a girl...  Yeah.  ...completely on her back.  The players, uh, you know, ran right through her.  Yeah.  And I guess she was wearing a skirt, and you can see what's going on under the skirt.  People are trying to figure out, A, if she's wearing panties, B, is it panties, C, is  it a cock?  Let me see.  So that's, that's why this is a great picture. 
[01:27:30]  I cannot even.  All right.  That is a great fucking picture.  It almost looks like it's, it's a penis tucked backwards.  Oh, wait.  This one here...  I might have to retweet this so you can study this thing.  What do you think, Jimbo?  I think it's funny.  All right.  Her legs are in the air.  It's a white skirt.  Her legs are in the air.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of, like, uh, spread a little bit.  It could be.  And I can't tell if it's panties.  I can't tell if it's, if it's her vagina in a weird way, in a weird fucking angle. 
[01:28:00]  Could be a pantyhose liner, too.  Like, you know, the middle of the pantyhose, you have the crotch?  I mean, it's studying it.  It could be that.  It also looks like a penis, right?  Well, I don't want to go right to the hotness.  I mean...  I want to squint to see if it...  I blew it up, too.  So, you know, you could squish it back down or something.  Yeah, I don't, um...  Let me see.  I can't figure that out for the life of me.  That's something weird.  I don't think it's really important.  I think that the looks aren't important.  I think she's shitting herself.  You think it's a log? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, look at it.  Yeah.  That's blown up really big.  What is that?  Oh, I know who she is.  Oh.  Yes.  She's an old Betty shit pussy.  She's a big, big Mavericks fan.  Does anyone have a picture of her before she went on her back like that?  Because we can't see the head.  Might be a pre-op.  A tranny, I think?  Might be a little pre-op action.  Oh, man.  What do you think?  It looks like the penis is tucked behind.  And look at the giant tits on the other girl to the right.  You can see, like, nips showing through that fucking thing. 
[01:29:00]  Yep.  Jesus.  What's going on at basketball these days?  My God.  They're rocking it.  Rocking it.  Rocking it.  Big black guy right there in front of that white vagina.  Well, that would be Dwayne Wade.  Ah.  He's one of the superstars.  Is he a superstar?  Well, it's him, Bosh, and stupid LeBron.  Ah.  How about Lum?  Got together.  Bosh, and?  Oh, wow.  That's...  Skyhook. 
[01:29:30]  I just threw my thing into the trash.  Speaking of hook.  Vaudeville joke.  Are we going to get the latest on Wiener or what?  Taylor Wiener.  That's all I know.  Yeah, I don't know if he's had anything...  Well, you heard of him getting somebody arrested or...  Oh, CBS reporter is off of him.  CBS reporter?  Marsha Kramer.  We know her a little bit.  This is how it went down.  Well, I came all the way to Washington, but Anthony Wiener wouldn't talk to me, and his  jittery, worn-out staff, believe it or not, they called the cops on me. 
[01:30:00]  I'm Marsha Kramer from CBS in New York City, and I was wondering if I could see the congressman.  Those few words caused a hullabaloo in Congressman Anthony Wiener's office today.  A hullabaloo?  Hullabaloo?  First of all...  Hullabaloo.  Hullabaloo.  Who?  By the way, bomb coming.  You can't just give us the setup.  Hullabaloo. 
[01:30:30]  Who?  And how did Hullabaloo know him?  Oh, that bomb blew the windows out.  Well, I want to know how Hullabaloo knew him.  Hullabaloo, yes.  Who?  It's like Abbott and Costello.  Hullabaloo's on first?  Hullabaloo.  All right.  Alan Greenspan is just not handsome. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Do you fart?  I certainly...  So, uh, Marsha Kramer goes to the Capitol Hill.  She wants her fucking interview.  Everyone wants their interview with Anthony Wiener.  They want to be the one that breaks him.  Right.  I think this shows that he's kind of fucking cracking a little bit.  He's losing his fucking mind.  Why would you call the police on a reporter?  He just keeps giving new pieces to talk about.  Yes.  Words caused a hullabaloo in Congressman Anthony Wiener's office today. 
[01:31:30]  Doors slammed.  People pretended I wasn't there.  Finally, brave Secretary David Arnold arrived.  And all I really...  Ha, ha, mail secretary.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Know what that means.  Arrived.  And all I really want to know is what he wants to say to his constituents,  who are the people back home who have to vote for him.  I don't know how you can say that he hasn't said anything to his constituents.  He spoke for nine hours yesterday.  But not to anybody in New York.  You know, this was sort of a... 
[01:32:00]  I'm, you know, in the bunker in the Capitol and wouldn't talk to anybody in New York.  After I left Wiener's office, his staff called Capitol Police.  Let me see some IDs.  One cop told me that if I went into Wiener's office and didn't leave, I could be arrested.  If you go into any member's office here, if you're asked to leave and you refuse to leave,  you can be placed under arrest.  Wow.  But I wouldn't refuse to leave.  I didn't say you were.  I was never asked to leave, but the fact that cops were called is a clear sign that the stress 
[01:32:30]  in Wiener's office over the situation is taking its toll.  Please replay that.  This is a fucking situation.  This woman sounds just like my mother.  It's making me very sad.  This fucking bitch talks like dead.  It's a clear sign that the stress in Wiener's office over the situation is taking its toll.  Nice fucking lips.  How is she a reporter?  She probably got the duck lips.  She probably got a little work done.  In this situation. 
[01:33:00]  And it froze one of her lips.  Stituous.  She's fucking terrible.  The fact that cops were called is a clear sign that the stress in Wiener's office over  the situation is taking its toll.  In fact, majority...  Wow, she has a tough time with S's.  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  What a fool she is.  I hate Marsha Kramer now.  She's terrible.  I didn't know who she worked for.  The stress in Wiener's office over the situation is taking its toll.  In fact, majority leader Eric Cantor became the first member of House leadership to go 
[01:33:30]  after Wiener.  My advice would be to come clean and clear it up.  I mean, again, perhaps he's trying, but I know there's a lot of explaining going on  without a lot of clarity.  Wiener himself had little to say.  Today I'm going to have to get back to work doing the job that I'm paid to do.  Experts say that ongoing questions could hurt his political ambitions.  Well, yeah.  I have to agree with him on that one.  She's hateable.  But you know what? 
[01:34:00]  I don't think these politicians should be able to run to the fucking Capitol to hide from  the press.  You know?  That shit is supposed to be open to the people.  And the press is part of, you know, we're talking First Amendment here.  These guys can't run away and not address situations that the people want to know about.  They fucking, you know, they work for us.  They're elected officials.  The press has every right to get in there and question the motherfucker. 
[01:34:30]  But the argument could be that in their office, at least when they're working, the press by  distracting, but the press by obsessing over a story that they think sells papers is actually  distracting him from doing what the people want him to do.  Like, he has a job to do and they have the right to ask him about it.  But that's like the press coming in here and just staring at us while we're on the air  instead of waiting outside the building.  I don't know.  We're not elected officials that serve.  Yes, we were.  We were elected by laughs. 
[01:35:00]  Really?  Oh, who was running against it?  Yeah, right?  Exactly.  Cancer?  Yeah.  Yes, we beat out anal warts by two chuckles and a smirk.  Holy shit.  That's right.  Everyone's got to get out there and vote.  That's right.  It's very important.  Yes, we're still behind polyps, but we're working on it.  And fucking, and plaque breath ran away with it this year.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just don't like the idea.  And they do it a lot.  They run to the fucking safety and sanctuary of the Capitol, and they have the Capitol police 
[01:35:30]  as their enforcers to keep the fucking press out.  He's just a dummy.  I don't know.  I don't like that.  That's another lack of this transparency that is going on.  No, sir.  I don't like it.  You think he's relieved it's Friday, this Anthony Weiner?  Yeah.  More dick pics over the weekend. 
[01:36:00]  Praying for a school shooting or anything.  Just anything.  Just anything.  Come on, news.  Yeah.  I mean, I understand.  Oh, boy.  Say it now.  Go ahead.  I mean, I have nothing against transparency.  Yeah.  I mean, if a male parent wants to dress like a woman, that's up to it.  It's just bomb after bomb after bomb. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, I apologize.  Wow.  I apologize to anybody with ears.  You ever see that footage of, like, a B-52 when the Bombay doors open up and they just  pour out?  Did you say footage?  Yeah.  Oh, I just scratch it?  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, this is terrible.  Wow.  Oh, are you an oaf?  What are you going to do?  Yeah, I'm just...  Yeah.  You're a sleepy boy.  I tried to sleep.  Are you going to nap when you get home, you think?  I'm going to fucking face plant. 
[01:37:30]  I'm going to have, like, one shoe off and face plant right into my fucking Lake Gitchaguni  sized cum stain on my fucking cum for her.  He always says Gitchaguni.  Is that wrong?  It's Gitchagumi.  Oh, exactly.  Well, mine's a bully.  Let's get you a goonie.  It bullies the other legs.  I can't survive this bombing.  I need a shelter. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, this really is a fucking...  Yeah.  This really is just one miscue after another.  This is...  I do need the nap, that's for sure.  Oh, fuck man.  I got a bit late.  I was watching Breaking Bad again.  I'm so hooked on this fucking show now.  That Bryan Cranston is just...  He's a good fucking actor, man.  I just don't know anything about the show.  He is really good.  Sounds like a great show, though.  Yeah, it's some guy who starts to realize he's diagnosed with the big casino and wants to leave his family money. 
[01:38:30]  So he gets into cooking up meth because he's a chemistry teacher, knows everything about chemistry, and puts out like the best crystal meth ever.  And it's his trials and tribulations of trying to sell it without being a dealer.  He's just a mild-mannered school teacher that gets into this life of...  But why would he care if he's going to die?  Well, he loves his family. 
[01:39:00]  He wants to leave them with money and not a bunch of debt from going through treatments.  Right.  Because they get up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bills, doctor bills, and he doesn't want to leave his family in debt.  So he figures he's going to cook up some crystal meth.  And it's just all the shit that snowballs from that one idea that seems like a good idea at the time.  And then it just snowballs into panda-fucking-monium.  But isn't it still a good idea if he has cancer? 
[01:39:30]  Well, uh...  What else is he supposed to do?  That's just it.  At the beginning, it seemed good.  And then I think he's starting to balance it out with, like, all the bad...  Yeah, because it's just bad shit.  The show is a lot deeper than just what's going on on the surface of the show.  Like, there's a lot of these little...  Things have other meanings and shit.  Nuances?  Nuances.  Are there nuances? 
[01:40:00]  Little circular, ironic things that happen and stuff.  I just kind of...  I like the show a lot.  Go ahead.  I didn't want to...  I just...  When you said nuances, I just thought, like, I just bought some nuances out of it.  I hate to go out and spend more.  You got excited, though.  His eyes lit up.  He's loving this.  What the fuck?  All right, well...  I'm going to get the box set.  Yeah, I think you might have just sold the show. 
[01:40:30]  Way better than Paris Hilton sells the show.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, I've only...  I've pretty much only...  You gave us a show to watch.  ...gotten completely into three shows.  Like, Lost, fucking The Wire, and now this one, where I just sit there every day and pop  one after another and watch these.  Yes, the dentist from Seinfeld is indeed the guy.  And he's the father from Malcolm in the Middle.  Which you see come out every so often. 
[01:41:00]  He's kind of goofy.  Really?  He's awkward and stuff.  He's really good.  Good show.  Good show.  Good show.  All right, we're going to do some spelling bee shit.  Yeah.  And then there's a Chinese kid that did something ridiculous.  Oh, what do you do?  I want shitty...  Oh, shitty...  Shitty wah.  Let's guess what he did ridiculous.  He entered a big penis contest with anybody but a gnat.  He used an acceleration lane on a highway. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  He said, I'll give you 50 bucks if my pubes are curly.  It's going to be a tough story to read.  There's a lot of fucking Chinese words in this one.  Really?  Did he throw a pointy hat into a helicopter?  What did he do that was wrong?  Think about it.  Wait.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Won't you?  Please?  He...  He said... 
[01:42:00]  Tired.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear.  But what we're certain of is you have AIDS. 
[01:42:30]  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  But full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  Party AIDS.  You've got the AIDS. 
[01:43:00]  Hey, I'm Hayden Panettiere from Heroes.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  And just like Opie, I'm still waiting on my invitation to Anthony's house.  Hey!  What was Sam talking about?  I'll be completely honest with you.  I don't want to be blamed for this one. 
[01:43:30]  Blamed.  If you guys want to do the blueberry incident, that's all.  I want to hear it.  I am making it perfectly clear that I do want to hear it, but I have nothing to fucking  do with this.  I walked in and you guys were just talking about something.  Because you don't want to be on Fez's bad side.  For doing nothing, by the way.  Well, we'll see.  Now that'll...  I know.  That's more detrimental.  Well, I haven't given up on the Batman incident.  I haven't given up on the, hey, Fez, what character would you be in the Batman thing? 
[01:44:00]  Because you like Batman.  See, this is what I thought I wanted him to cry.  What if I thought you were Jamaican, calling him a Batman?  Jesus.  That's why you've been Jamaican.  How many sorties are you flying today?  No kidding.  Wow.  I've never looked forward to 10 o'clock before in my life.  Like today, anyway.  I look forward to it, but man, today I'm watching that fucking clock.  The blueberry incident.  Yes.  Now, I am not...  I have nothing to do with this. 
[01:44:30]  I heard about it just now, while we were in commercial, and I want to hear it.  I want to know what it is.  You sold it to the point where I now want to hear it.  Hold on.  All I know is we were talking about it, and then Jimmy walks in and goes, whatever you're  talking about, I need to hear it.  And he has no idea what we're talking about.  I really don't.  The blueberry incident, I have to know.  Is it connected with the fredberry incident? 
[01:45:00]  Well, how about the Marvin Berry incident?  Or is that the code word when you land on a table and someone drops little doodies on  you?  Yes.  With Chuck Berry.  With Chuck Berry.  That means you want doodies on your face with glass.  Atta boy.  Right back to shit.  Chuck Berry loved that.  Who doesn't?  I guess we were discussing that Ronnie's on the grand jury, so it's fucking up his radio  show a little bit.  Yeah.  But he's also... 
[01:45:30]  But he is doing it still.  He is.  He's recording a little bit.  He's going live a little bit.  He's all over the place.  Working guy.  The show's not all over the place.  He is.  Because he has to go down to his office and tape some shit.  Then he comes in here live and does a little something, something.  And then in between all this, he's on a jury.  The grand jury.  Right.  And we were talking about...  I said I miss him being on the 10 o'clock with me.  And then you guys said, what are Ron and Fez up to?  What are they doing?  Yeah.  And so I explained that what I had heard on Ron and Fez yesterday was very funny to  me.  The way Ron was doing it and everything was he kept bringing up something that he was 
[01:46:00]  calling...  I believe he called it the blueberry incident.  And he kept playing it, so this isn't a secret.  They cut it in dilette, and he played it two or three times that I heard at the end of  the show yesterday.  So this is a good kind of a crossover between the two shows right here.  I think so.  Cross promotion.  I think so.  But now it's going to turn into blueberry gate.  Well, I don't think it's...  It's something that Ron and Fez played.  We thought it was funny, so we're playing.  Right?  I didn't think it was funny, because I haven't heard it yet.  I thought it was funny the way it was done on Ron and Fez. 
[01:46:30]  Like I said, I have nothing to do with this one.  I want to hear...  Sample it to our attention.  Well, it was on the radio.  Sample it to our attention.  It's not...  I haven't dug up anything.  Have you heard this yet, Ant?  I have not heard this.  I have not heard it.  Jimmy has not heard it.  But from what I know, Fez seems to bring up a topic.  Yeah.  And it slowly falls apart, and Fez completely loses all confidence.  He just lost confidence in the topic that he brought up.  That's what it sounded like to me.  I wasn't in Fez's head, so I don't know exactly what happened. 
[01:47:00]  But all I know is that...  Oh, okay.  It quickly falls apart.  It's not a long clip.  No, no.  And the topic didn't end up going on long, and they ended up doing some stuff with it  yesterday, but...  Did Ronnie not think it was a good topic?  He didn't have time to react to it.  Okay.  See, I fucking...  Oh, my gosh.  I love this.  So do you want to hear the clip?  I want to hear nothing else right now.  All right.  Does this lead to Fez crying?  I would hope not.  I don't think Fez should cry over this, because yesterday, they turned it into something funny. 
[01:47:30]  It's entertaining.  It's radio.  Did Fez find it funny?  If you hit a...  And what Ronnie did with this?  If you hit a speed bump on the road, and it turns into something good for the show,  I think Fez should still get credit for providing...  Exactly.  Did Fez find it funny?  I mean, you'd have to ask Fez.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, boy.  That's right.  All right.  Again, I can't be in Fez's head.  Right.  But I would have found it funny.  We'll apologize in advance for all the crying you're here today.  He's not going to cry.  It's not long.  Now I have to hear a shitty Ron and Fez on this show. 
[01:48:00]  It's not shitty.  You know what?  You know what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Two seconds.  Uh-oh.  I sense a bounceroo coming.  Here you go, fucker.  No.  Now you don't have to.  There.  Bye.  That's right.  Bye.  TCB in a flash.  There you go.  Now you don't have to.  There.  There.  You want to roll on that motherfucker by that?  It's as easy as that.  I mean, ban.  Easy as that.  I like that.  You want a bitch that we're going to play 50 fucking three seconds of a show that we're 
[01:48:30]  friends with, and this sounds kind of funny and interesting and awkward and weird  for 53 fuck seconds.  If you can't take it, goodbye.  Yep.  Toodaloo.  We're experts.  We already know this is going to work.  That's right.  We no longer are perts.  I can't say to you.  841.  We were perts.  841.  Now we're experts.  I know. 
[01:49:00]  Wishful thinking.  821.  Can't even read the clock.  Jimmy.  Oh, God.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  It's going to be funny.  Ron and Fez do a funny show, and this was a moment that they were sharing on their show  that I thought, I always feel like Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez should come together  as a family.  Is there a Hannity and Combs situation happening with Ron and Fez?  No, they love each other very much.  Okay, just wondering.  The blueberry incident.  Hit it.  Fucker.  I'll tell you this, though.  Fez brought up the fucking main thing. 
[01:49:30]  That fucking guacamole, if it's made correctly, is the shit.  It's pretty good.  Like, I don't know if I've ever had a really good song.  Yeah, I haven't had it really good.  Well, Chipotle has some decent guacamole.  I have it every so often.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[01:50:00]  The voice is going to get the spot after the Super Bowl.  That's, of course, if we have a Super Bowl this coming season.  Holy shit.  Wow.  And then Ronnie gets mad if you call him a shitster. 
[01:50:30]  Well, he's not.  Ronnie hung him out.  No, he's letting Fez take the stick.  They're co-hosts.  Can I please hear that again?  The trembling voice, the not really knowing where it's going, and the complete silence.  He explained yesterday that what he was trying to say was that blueberry juice is not something  that's served on its own.  Right.  It's got to be mixed with something else.  Yes.  He could have gotten that point across, but you could tell he lost confidence in what 
[01:51:00]  he was saying completely.  I don't think I've ever heard anything more uncomfortable.  No.  I can't think of anything that comes close to this.  That is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever heard.  We just had Bears Hilton in here yesterday.  Yes.  This is so uncomfortable.  You could hear it degenerating and just falling apart.  But the beauty of it, it degenerates before it starts.  Yes.  Like, he never had confidence.  And it's not that Ronnie B did.  He didn't say anything.  Well, that's just it.  Ronnie could have said it.  Ronnie didn't say anything.  Fez had the stick, though. 
[01:51:30]  It was Fez's topic.  Fez had the stick.  Fez had the stick.  He had the spirit stick.  I'm suspicious of that, Ronnie B.  That's all I'm saying.  Suspicious.  Sometimes Ron takes the stick.  Sometimes Fez takes the stick.  That was as close as you could get to a bertation.  And still be speaking some words.  Ron doesn't want to step all over Fez when Fez is going somewhere.  Oh, boy.  Hey, you think that guy you banned feels like an asshole now?  Yeah.  See?  See?  Jackass.  You know what the fuck we're doing?  Fuck wad. 
[01:52:00]  Jackass.  What's a fuck wad?  A fuck wad.  It's a wad of fuck.  Yeah.  It's what you do to a big, big bundle of cash.  Fuck it.  Blow it.  8.25.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Once again.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a standalone fruit. 
[01:52:30]  The voice is going to get the spot.  All right.  Pause again.  Pause.  The breathing.  We're going to do this at least another five times.  The breathing.  Hold on.  That time, I actually stopped breathing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking breathing.  Standalone fruit.  How appropriate is it in that moment he was saying standalone fruit? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, God.  How dare you?  Oh, no.  That's going to get him crying.  He won't cry.  Tease him.  This.  How dare you?  Yeah, but he doesn't understand teasing.  The shaking voice and then the, you hear, just him breathing and then clawing to try  to get to another subject.  We've all lost focus for a minute.  Well, that's true.  It's not that, you know, it happens.  We've lost focus for years.  This is the sound of a flower wilting. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, well, don't phrase it like that.  That's what it is.  You make so?  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's listen to this again.  Please.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a standalone fruit.  The voice is going to get the, uh, what is Ronnie doing at that point? 
[01:54:00]  Just staring at him?  Is Ronnie just staring at him?  I don't personally know what was going on at that exact point.  I have seen scenarios, though, when Ron stares directly at Fez while Fez is trying to figure  out what to do with that.  He is a brilliant radio host.  I'm suspicious of that motherfucker.  But that's because-  I'm suspicious. 
[01:54:30]  Ron says that when Ron is talking, there are many times where Fez sits silently staring  at him.  So Ron says, well, that's what we do then.  Oh, shit.  That's what he told me.  He told me that on the air once that sometimes I got to give it back to him a little bit.  Did he have a-  But not like hostily.  That's just the chemistry.  Did he have a mini stroke?  It was-  In the middle of that?  Like the kiwi.  It's a stand-  What he was getting at was the juices.  Right.  You can't just have blueberry juice.  Or kiwi juice, for instance.  Or kiwi juice.  But if you have kiwi- 
[01:55:00]  Blueberry.  Grape juice.  Cranberry juice with blueberry juice in it.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  See, this is where he should have went.  That's where he was going.  You know?  Like, hey, the blueberry.  Cranberry, not a stand-alone juice.  You mix it with cranberry juice, though.  Delicious.  Yes.  I've had some.  It's fantastic.  You enjoy it.  It kind of perks up the cranberry if you just-  You know, you don't want cranberry juice.  Sometimes it's a little too tart.  So you mix it with other fruits.  It's wonderful.  That's great to humiliate Fez by showing him what he should have done. 
[01:55:30]  Basically, what you're saying is here's how Fez should do his job.  Because he doesn't know how to do it.  No.  Sure you are.  Like, here's what Fez could have done.  Watch how easy it is for me.  No, I was just saying, the way it tailed off, see, but I know Fez, he can do that.  He has done it, and he will continue to do it.  You want to hear it again?  I can't stop hearing this.  You stop breathing, right?  Yes.  His breathing is the most disturbing thing. 
[01:56:00]  His breathing in those gaps of not knowing what to say.  And the immediate depression.  It's immediate.  Listen how quickly it goes from, a blueberry, like he started out just saying blueberries with energy,  and then it completely falls apart.  Wow.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[01:56:30]  The voice is going to get the spot after...  I picked up on something else.  Oh, God.  The closing of the studio door.  I thought that was happening live.  No, I just picked up.  I believe...  Who's leaving the studio?  I believe Ron left the studio.  No way!  I truly believe it.  No way! 
[01:57:00]  In my heart...  See, I wasn't there.  I'm just going by the audio, but I believe that Ron left.  We got that big, heavy door, and the first few times I was listening to it, I wasn't thinking,  and then I heard it there, and I'm thinking, wait, who just walked in in the middle of that clip?  And then I look up, the door is closed, no one's walking in, so now it's on the tape,  which means somebody walked out in the middle of that.  And you're saying it's Ron.  I believe it was Ron.  Now listen for the door.  I'm not sure, but I believe it was Ron.  So you think Ron just walked out the studio?  Maybe he got a phone call.  Well, or maybe he was looking at Fez and just went, well, I gotta leave the studio. 
[01:57:30]  Well, let's listen for the door sound effect.  Okay.  Obviously...  You wanted to listen again?  Obviously, yes.  Obviously, the door has to open, and by the time you hear that sound, that means the person  is gone.  It's gone, out of the room.  And that might have distracted Fezzy.  Okay.  So let's listen again now for the door sound effect.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[01:58:00]  There it is.  The voice is going to get...  That's the door!  Someone left!  I think it might have been Ron.  I think Ronnie walked away.  It's also...  It's tough to do a show that's so caller-centric.  You know, Ron and Fez are all about the listeners getting involved. 
[01:58:30]  Sure.  And these shows are being taped, so they don't have phones.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  It's tougher.  Yeah, they can't...  For everybody involved.  Showing the brilliance of Ron.  Still pulling it off without the phones.  And Fez.  Ron and Fez.  1-866-RON.  Zero Fez.  1-866-RON.  Zero Fez.  He can't say the phone number anymore because it's not as busy.  It's nobody to answer it.  Yeah, yeah.  Are we done with the blueberry incident?  I would hope so because it seems like you guys are poking fun.  I would say one more time just to see if we missed anything else. 
[01:59:00]  You're on a healthy kick.  Once more.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit.  The voice is going to get the...  All right, listen, we're getting... 
[01:59:30]  That's brilliant.  Travis of Buffalo was listening yesterday.  Oh, okay.  Might have more to the story.  Travis?  Yeah, yeah.  You guys pretty much got it now.  But he left the studio to get Pepper Hicks a turkey sandwich.  And that's when all that happened.  You can't just get up and get someone a turkey sandwich.  Pepper was hungry.  Pepper is a very talented person.  He needs to eat.  He needed a turkey sandwich.  So Ronnie figured Fez had to stick.  I'm going to go get this kid a turkey sandwich.  Why is Travis playing along here with Ronnie?  Ronnie, I'm telling you, I'm suspicious of that guy. 
[02:00:00]  Pepper gets hungry.  Pepper's a big guy.  So Ronnie needed to get the turkey sandwich.  Ronnie needed to get Pepper Hicks a turkey sandwich.  Because Pepper had been there.  At that point, he was getting...  Probably towards dinner time, since they were taping after the show.  In the middle of that, Ronnie figured he would leave the studio.  To get a turkey sandwich.  Well, Fez had to stick.  And everyone thinks it's logical for Ronnie to do that.  Well, it's Ron and Fez.  So he figured Fez got this.  I'm going to go grab this kid a turkey sandwich.  Let's start watching that, Ronnie, a little closer, I think.  By the way, blueberries and turkey. 
[02:00:30]  What's your thoughts?  Yeah, thoughts?  Thoughts on the blueberry and the turkey.  You're not taking blueberries seriously anymore.  I know cranberries, and that cranberry sauce goes well with fucking turkey.  Now, you usually don't eat cranberry sauce by itself.  You need it with the stuffing or with the turkey.  This is what you do.  You do the cranberry, you do the turkey with a little gravy, you put the mashed potatoes  and a little corn all together.  That's delish.  I separate my food.  I don't like it getting mixed up.  You don't mix that shit together?  No, I don't even like a corn kernel getting into my mashed potatoes.  Much like your neighborhood. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  I like it completely segregated on my plate.  How I wish this country was like my plate on Thanksgiving.  Were you guys really doing that topic, or were you making light of the...  You know, the wings and legs hit one side.  What kind of meat is that called?  Oh, yeah.  What we're showing you, Sam, is we can make magic out of anything.  Throw something at us, we make magic.  That's what we do here.  Anyone else with that Paris Hilton crap yesterday would have been a stinkeroo.  We made magic out of that horse shit.  Let me now clear the bounce on that gentleman. 
[02:01:30]  Why?  Let him suffer for the rest of the day.  He's made others suffer.  It's only right.  He should suffer proper.  That's right.  And I bet you he's guilty of other shit.  I'm sure he is.  Leave him right where the fuck he is.  I think he's gone.  He's weeping now.  He's a dick.  We might have to play it again, guys, because Chris and Phoenix writes, you can hear the  mic rig squeaking as he walks away.  He had to get the kid a turkey sandwich.  He had to get him a turkey sandwich, huh?  Yeah.  Who doesn't like turkey?  Look, we're trying to move on, but if there's a mic squeak in here, Sam, we got to do our 
[02:02:00]  jobs and make sure that it is a mic squeak.  I was going to play this for you off the air, but I mean...  Let it be known, Sam brought this to our show.  It was on the air.  I was listening to Ron and Fez yesterday.  Well, you should have been.  I listen every day.  I was editing shit.  I'm a fan of Ron and Fez.  I wanted to bring what I like from that show to this show, because we all share.  Right.  They're a great show.  One more time, man, or no?  It's your call.  Oh, yeah.  I would say once more.  Sure.  Sure.  Well, we want to listen for the mic squeak.  Of course.  Yeah, I want to hear the mic squeak now.  You didn't hear the squeak.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit.  You can just picture Ronnie just not even acknowledging what's going on,  opening that door, walking out. 
[02:03:00]  Headed down to the deli to get a turkey sandwich from Mr. Hicks.  Like he's leaving his house.  And you heard it very early on.  You heard kind of a, like a, you heard the mic a little bit.  He was all finished.  Now someone's saying, oh, Kevin from Connecticut, he says, listen for the heavy sigh.  Oh, I hear the heavy sigh.  Oh, really?  Who's heavy sigh is that?  Is that Fez's heavy sigh?  Oh, is that?  I'm not sure.  I'm asking you guys.  I don't know.  Or is it Ron's sigh?  B-Rock, turn up the volume so we can hear the heavy sigh.  You're going to play it again?  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Now the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit.  Um, the voice, uh, is-  I heard the heavy sigh.  All right.  I'm not sure whose sigh that was, though.  Oh, come on.  It could have been Ron's or Fez's.  Or it could have even been Pepper Hicks just sighing because he was so hungry because of the sandwich. 
[02:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Keep in mind, Pepper Hicks did not have the sandwich yet.  Ron was on his way to get the sandwich.  Why didn't Pepper go get it?  He probably ended up producing, staying in the studio.  I think it's more important to have Mr. Bennington in studio.  Well, Fez had the stick.  The stick.  You and that stick.  Ah, that's what Ronnie says.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's just using the, uh, proper, uh, terminology.  He had the con.  One time a couple weeks ago, Ron-  The yoke.  Ron let Fez take the stick for the last two hours of the show. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  How'd that work out?  It was great.  It was a great show.  Yeah.  It's like this for two hours.  You're really hedging your bets on both of these shows, aren't you?  Someone's gonna die.  Oh, I know.  That's it.  Sam is straddling two shows.  Ron and Fez is a great show.  Opie and Anthony, great show.  Shut up.  The virus is a great channel when you think about it.  Ronnie walked out is what caused Fez to melt down.  So then there was a meltdown yesterday, too?  Well, I think that what you're listening to would be considered a meltdown by many.  Uh, Bill, go ahead real fast, please. 
[02:05:00]  Whoa, Bill.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Bill T.  Uh, the sound of the door that you're hearing is probably Ron coming back in.  Well, what made Fez stumble like that was that Ron had left.  Made him all nervous, you know?  Well, Fez doesn't like to be left alone, but who does?  And was this addressed after, like, after what we heard?  Did something come up?  Did Ronnie talk about the blueberries?  Well, yeah, this was on the tapes, and then when that came back live, Ron talked about it, and they played it. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, Ron, and then they played the tape yesterday and said, Ron said he had missed it because he had left, I guess.  That's the way he was saying when he said he missed it.  And what did Fez do as they were playing?  Fez was not happy about it.  He was unhappy with his performance.  And then Ron asked Fez to further explain what he, and that's when Fez brought up the juices.  BTW.  Yes.  Jack Kevorkian dead.  Yep.  No.  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  Yes, Jack Kevorkian.  Breaking.  They think it was a suicide murder.  Suicide murder.  It's a loop.  Yes, it is.  But, I mean, in terms of, I don't know, Fez didn't have a meltdown.  It's just that topic didn't go the way he wanted it.  Yeah, we've had that happen.  Ron had to head out and grab a turkey sandwich.  Like, Ant, I think me and Danny could use a couple of sandwiches if you want to head down.  Well, you know.  Wait, they still have interns, though, right?  Opie and Jim have the stick. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I can go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To me, it's like the Navigator leaving.  It's not even one of the fucking pilots.  Just throw the stick elsewhere, you know?  I love talking about blueberries, so I have no problem with this.  You made blueberries a famous radio thing.  That's right, I did.  I'm kind of mad that he's ripping me off.  Talking about the blueberries.  Let's take a break.  I guess that's it for the blueberry incident.  You got some soup in front of you?  Yay, soup.  What the fuck was he doing talking about blueberries anyway? 
[02:07:00]  What was the juices?  What are you doing to me?  The juice.  What is he doing?  To my neighbors?  Oh.  No, juice.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  You think about juices, I guess?  Well, you can go to this whole aisle of juices.  You think about it.  You don't fucking bring it up.  Listen, Jim, when you go to the supermarket, you'll see a bottle of cranberry juice, correct?  Gives a shit.  Now, follow me on this.  You'll see a bottle of cranberry juice, but you won't see a bottle of blueberry juice. 
[02:07:30]  And if you did, you probably wouldn't buy it.  You wouldn't drink that bottle.  You'd have the cranberry, because cranberry is standalone, whereas blueberry would need to be mixed with the cranberry.  This subject wouldn't be interesting to me if Hayden Panetaria was spitting it at me through her pussy lips.  Wow.  Whatever that fucking midget leg's name is.  It's her.  It's one of those observational things that people talk about.  Yeah, they go, who gives a shit? 
[02:08:00]  They're in supermarkets, and all of a sudden you go, wow, look at the juice aisle.  They're mixing up a lot of juices.  Oh, no.  Because you're not going to get a kiwi juice.  And then you make the observation that you don't see the blueberry juice mixed with many things.  You don't think about it.  You're like, you thirsty?  No.  Go fuck yourself.  But when somebody else brings it up, you go, oh, I never thought about that.  No, you don't.  And then it makes you wonder a little bit, Jimmy.  No, it doesn't.  The world is full of wonderment.  And you wonder about blueberries.  No, you don't.  In context, I think a blueberry conversation can work. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  In context, compared to what?  What's the other option?  Would you like your feet severed?  No, I'll take the blueberry conversation.  Have you had blueberry juice?  A lot.  You know why you don't know about it?  Because nobody wants to hear it.  You know, in the context of explaining how it's not a standalone.  Is blueberry fruit?  Is blueberry mixed with anything in juices?  Sometimes you can have a blueberry cranberry cocktail.  Can you?  I bet you they don't even do that.  A berry drink, where it's all kinds. 
[02:09:00]  Blackberries, raspberries, blueberries.  Fucking sucky.  You're a second to the juice, man.  You're not going to see it.  Oh, blueberries, what better?  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet like a mixed berry beverage.  Give her a blackberry.  She'll love me in the morning.  I can't even have a fucking smoothie with her.  Her juicer is so polluted.  Oh, look at me.  I'm the blueberry. 
[02:09:30]  A Afro Trucker writes, that's the perfect example of a stick in the mud.  A stick in the mud.  That's not true.  How does he have the stick?  It might have got caught in the mud there.  But he got right back out of it.  He started talking about the voice.  Huh?  The voice.  He brought up another topic.  He said, maybe I'll move on to something else.  Yeah, he was able to just transition.  And he brought back the blueberry thing the next day and talked about the juices.  And it's, you know, something we're talking about today.  That's how he pulled it off a lot better after giving it some thought. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And it's compelling enough that today, me, you, Anthony, Jim, and Opie are all saying.  Rifling through our iPhones.  I've been checking Twitter for the last 15 minutes, Sam.  Thank you.  I'm looking at my soup, just dying to eat it.  I'm kidding.  I can't do this.  I'm completely kidding.  I don't need Fez fucking thinking.  I'm just teasing.  Of course you are.  I know, but he has to know that.  You're a sweet boy.  I did buckle.  He's not going to know that.  Hell no.  Because after I apologized profusely and said I would never try to make you cry. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, but you were grilling him.  Yeah, but that was after a reaction.  I haven't seen any reaction.  I don't even know if he's going to hear it.  Oh, the reaction was he started crying.  I was in shock that a dumb question like that made you cry.  I can't tease him.  So you started grilling him when you went on that show.  I wasn't grilling him.  Yeah.  Flame broiling him.  I'm not playing this, Sam.  Well, what did you do?  Because he'll now take this as serious shit.  I was trying to get him involved.  You asked him a question, though.  I asked him what his likes are.  He finally admitted Batman.  Then I said, all right, a goofy radio bit.  What character would you be in Batman? 
[02:11:00]  Everyone would come up with a character.  Blueberry man.  Why would you ask him that?  And then he starts crying.  And he goes, well, you accomplished what you wanted.  What did I want?  Well, you obviously wanted to hurt him.  Yeah, with the Batman deal.  What kind of questions is that?  Yeah, you don't bring up Batman like that.  Not like that.  I don't have any idea.  That's a lot of pressure.  And then our good pal Justin Stengel was on the phone.  And he...  Getting the radio.  And he's like, what the fuck's going on?  And then...  No, no, no, no.  And then Fez is like, yeah, he's in on it, too.  Justin Stengel, I know Justin Stengel, and I know that he called up Ron and Fez with 
[02:11:30]  the intention to put the boots to Fez that day.  Don't do this.  I'm not even kidding.  I don't know about you, but I know that's...  He doesn't understand joking sometimes.  Don't do this, Sam.  That's what Stengel's intention is.  Because now he's going to believe, you know, that was our intention.  Justin Stengel wanted him to cry.  I don't know about you, Obi, but...  Don't do this.  Stengel wanted Fez crying that day.  Don't do it.  I think that's true.  Because now Fezzy will believe it again.  Well, I mean, that's my opinion, but I took it to believe that Justin Stengel wanted Fez  to cry.  He probably did. 
[02:12:00]  He probably did, knowing him.  All right.  Justin's a prick.  He likes people crying.  He loves to see it.  Yeah.  No.  I don't know about you, Obi.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying about Justin Stengel, he was hoping Fez would cry that day.  Whenever there's tears on his Facebook page, he puts like.  Exactly.  Now we have to tell Fezzy that's a joke, too.  It's not.  Not to me.  Don't worry about it.  All right, Sam.  We get it.  All right.  Save that shit for the shit hour.  Okay.  Exactly.  Okay.  All right.  Time to eat?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Time to.  Phase two of eating.  Phase two.  Soup.  At friggin' 8.45 in the morning.  Oh, shit.  Today's the day.  Schedule's all weird.  Ronnie said a.  Hold on.  What?  One more thing, then we'll move on.  Cody in Wisconsin.  Cody.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  About a month and a half or a month ago, they were having a device show again.  And somebody called in and said they were sick of the shit.  And if Ronnie was to put a date on it, when was the date that Fez had to get better or 
[02:13:00]  he was done?  And today was the date, according to my form, where I typed it into the calendar.  So what?  Fezzy had a month to get his shit together?  And today's the last day of the month?  June 3rd.  Yep.  He picked June 3rd.  Fuck.  Another reason to listen to Ron and Fez today.  He's got his shit together pretty much, Fez.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  There's a couple of speed bumps.  Good to know.  Good to know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Good to know.  And there you have it.  The blueberry incident.  Yeah, Fez is doing all right.  He's doing fine.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I like that.  He's doing great. 
[02:13:30]  Every road has a speed bump.  Sure.  Otherwise, people would speed.  And that's dangerous.  Yeah, and get somewhere.  How dare you?  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's quick.  Yesterday, a girl made Fez cry?  What did she say?  That's line five.  What are we doing?  I just want to know what she said.  It's an act, I think.  Dave.  He's crying.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yesterday, I felt bad for Fez because he was on a conversation with a lady.  And the lady used to like his show back in the 90s. 
[02:14:00]  And she realized that it's not the same old Fez.  And that made Fez cry.  The girl made him cry.  I heard that call.  I don't know if Fez is actually crying.  That's why we've got to move out of this topic because now it's going to get real.  I've got to be honest with people.  I only feel sorry for the people that cry every once in a while.  Fez is dealing with a lot, though.  That's all I'm saying.  He's saying you have no empathy for Fez at all.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  There are people in my life that fucking cry a lot.  After a while, I don't have sympathy for those people. 
[02:14:30]  So you're saying you have no sympathy for Fez?  But if someone comes out of nowhere that you don't expect to cry and they're breaking down,  I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for that person.  But you're saying for Fez you don't.  I'm not going to use individual names.  But what if you're, I think the implication is you're just sad all the time.  That's a lot worse than once in a while.  All right.  So you're saying it's old hat by this point.  But why do you continue to feel sorry for those people?  Because they're human.  They have sadness.  Because they're in pain and sadness the whole time instead of just occasionally.  Obviously, they have a lot on their plate.  Yeah.  You're saying they're human garbage. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, you're B-rock?  No, not their dinner plate.  Oh, okay.  The lunch or breakfast.  I was talking about the literal.  He eats off a tectonic plate.  Is that the word?  Sorry, B-rock.  Did I get the word right?  Close enough for the joke.  You got it.  Close enough.  The judges are accepting it as an E-rock fat joke.  Yes.  I'm taking my ball right now.  Tectonic plate.  And it feels marvelous.  Are you rolling it between your thumb and your forefinger?  I am.  I'm like fucking Captain Queeg on the stand. 
[02:15:30]  Strawberries.  Yes.  How many portions did you have?  I knew it would do.  It smelled onion-y because I rolled it in my fingers and sniffed them.  Old onion hands, they called them.  He was always rattling his balls around in his pocket.  His balls.  You think E-rock's got the Brian Regan bit?  No.  Why would he?  Want to make a bet, anybody?  That is a good one.  He wouldn't have it if you said, hey, E-rock, get the Brian Regan bit.  The speed at which those fingers are moving right now would lead me to believe it.  It's a classic bit about juices and mixing all the juices.  The only bit E-rock should have is a snaffle bit in his mouth. 
[02:16:00]  It's an equestrian joke.  Like a big, fat horse?  Yes, yes.  Like a Clydesdale.  Oh, he's fat.  We should go easy on it.  Oh, and when athletes cry, no sympathy.  Why?  This is what it sounds like when Fizz cries.  Did anyone do that yet?  Hey, hey, hey.  I think Sleeves is working on that.  Sleeves is working on it?  Yeah.  This is what it sounds like when Fizz cries.  Have you warmed up on that Christmas song?  No!  For boo-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[02:16:30]  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  We've got a lot of the Sleeves.  Listening to Fizz with a boo-hoo-hoo.  Losing all sympathy, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Talking about blueberries, boo-hoo-hoo.  Motherfucker cries at the drop of a blueberry or a hat or anything that falls.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  No, that's a boo-boo-boo.  That's not the lyrics to this song.  La-la-la-la.  La-la-la.  The boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Boo-boo-hoo-hoo.  Sleeves got something going on, man. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, God.  Well, I do follow him on the Twitter.  Good.  And he doesn't tweet very often, but I do follow the Sleeves.  You got the bride reading a bit?  No, I don't see anything ever.  Of course.  Why would it be?  Oh, Jesus.  Money to me.  Is it online?  It doesn't matter.  Oh, Eric.  You should just be fired on the spot.  Eric, just look it up on the internet and do it for us.  Yeah.  Just read it.  Yeah.  Find the transcript.  Yeah.  Yeah.  La-la-la-la-la. 
[02:17:30]  Playing turkey foot now.  La-la-la-la-la.  Kiss you on your tummy now.  La-la-la-la-la.  Snake my way down a little.  La-la-la-la-la.  Uncle Paul has his hand in his pants.  Oh, like Uncle Paul's hands are down his pants.  Yeah.  He's manipulating himself, singing a Sleeves parody.  Sure.  I see London.  I see France.  Oh, no.  Put my hand down your diaper underpants. 
[02:18:00]  That's disgusting.  Little Paul.  Now there's a rumor that Fez was just reading the note that Ron gave him.  Maybe.  Oh, Ron gave him a note?  I don't know who started that.  Who started the rumor?  See, I'm watching that guy.  I'm suspicious.  Ron is a good guy.  So is Fez.  I didn't say he wasn't a good guy.  I love them both.  Here's a very good guy.  John and Callie.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, I'm just wondering, man.  Like, why? 
[02:18:30]  I mean, I don't know what the big issue is, man.  Like, it's like everybody walks on or it's like walks on and shows on Fez.  It's like.  Well, we're all scared of Fez.  It's not that we're scared of Fez.  We all care about Fez.  Right.  And we don't like that he's upset.  We like to make him happy.  I hate to see Fez upset, but everybody else seems to enjoy it because they get a kick out of  his pain and tears.  Based on what we said today.  They don't look at him like a real person.  They look at him as a character on the radio.  But that's, you know, that's him.  Like a sideshow attraction. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  I'm a set characters.  Oh, okay.  Because you know what I mean?  Dude, you're fucking ONA, man.  No, the company's fucking ONA.  That should be making us cry.  Trust me.  It's weird for you guys.  You know what I mean?  No, we're definitely scared of Fez.  He's unpredictable.  Very unpredictable.  Yeah.  That's why I'm on my girl.  My girl's the same way, dude.  I got to watch my girl. 
[02:19:30]  All right.  So you understand.  Good to go, man.  All right.  Push it out.  Hey, should we just play the blueberry incident one more time going into break if we don't  have the Brian Regan thing?  We might as well.  We might as well.  One more time.  You don't have Brian Regan, right?  No.  All right.  All right.  He does a terrific juice bit, but instead we do this.  Fez's juice bit.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's a, not a, a standalone, standalone fruit. 
[02:20:00]  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at opiananthony.com.  Opie and Anthony.  And there you have it.  Brian Regan and his juice bit.  Notice he didn't mention blueberry in that.  Wow, wow.  No. 
[02:20:30]  Everything but.  He even went with pork chops before he mentioned blueberries.  The banana guy.  I ain't in nothing.  Fucking funny-ass guy.  Yeah, Brian.  He doesn't need me saying that.  Brian.  Uh.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Where's Travis?  I just saw him.  Trav-eye.  I need to know the story of Bono.  Did you hear the story of Bono, eh?  Uh, the story of Bono.  And I can do this by myself if you don't care.  I don't think. 
[02:21:00]  You can walk down and get a turkey sandwich.  I wouldn't mind.  That's okay.  I'll stick around.  I guess Bono was in Canada.  Goes for a walk.  It starts fucking raining.  So he goes, ah, I'm not walking in the rain.  So he sticks out his fucking thumb.  Bono's hitching.  Hitching.  And he got picked up?  I'm trying to remember the last time I was hitchhiking ever.  But yeah, there's Bono hitchhiking.  And then, and then I guess, uh, Gilbert, uh, Brule.  Is that how you say his name?  He plays for the Edmonton Oilers. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know much about him.  Is he a big-time hockey player there, Travis?  You don't know either?  They're okay.  Bono.  Uh, he picks up fucking Bono on the road.  What was his name?  Gilbert, uh, Brule.  B-R-U-L-E.  Guy in the booth is, we call him Creme Brule.  Oh.  I thought you said that.  Anything to get that fat joke in.  Ah, well.  Um, that's pretty weird.  Imagine you're driving along some idiot's hitchhiking.  No one picks up hitchhikers, really, unless they're hot teens.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  And, uh, it's Bono.  He jumps into your fucking truck.  Yeah, he said he had to, like,  convince his wife to go back,  because he's like, that's Bono.  Like, he was sure that it was Bono  just walking along the road,  and so they went back.  They stopped at a farmhouse,  and, uh, went to stay overnight,  and the farmer said,  just don't sleep with my daughter.  And Bono, uh, went in.  You're thinking of Seinfeld.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, that was Newman.  And then what?  They made a big deal,  Bono signed some shit,  and then he talked about him  during that concert or something. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, Bono asked him  if he wanted to come, uh,  come to his show, like,  two days later in Edmonton,  so he actually,  he sold his,  his Stanley Cup Game 1 tickets  that he was gonna go to.  To see U2.  Yeah, to go see U2.  That's pretty cool.  And the other thing,  I didn't get to hear it,  but you, uh,  wrote me and said,  who's doing what?  Oh, yeah,  Trent Reznor and Karen O  covered, uh,  Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin  for, uh,  Wow.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Who'd Led Zeppelin cover  when they did it?  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Is it good?  Can we hear it?  I think it's pretty decent. 
[02:23:00]  I always, I hated Trent Reznor.  He's a mope.  Did you?  Yeah, he's a mope.  And while we're doing music,  stupid shit,  Eddie Vedder admitted  that he was running out of ideas  for his dumb ukulele album.  Oof.  He thought it was a good idea  at first and then said,  fuck, what am I gonna do  with the ukulele?  Of course, it's stupid.  Sing Tiny Bubbles again,  jizzbag.  Ukulele.  It's a fucking horrible instrument.  Oh, I like Eddie Vedder.  I'd rather play the shotgun  with my toe.  Fucking despise the ukulele. 
[02:23:30]  It's terrible.  It's a great album.  I want to hear Trent Reznor do it.  It's not a great album.  Yes, it is.  The ukulele?  Here we go.  Trent Reznor.  Karen O.  What would Lele do to deserve it?  I'm very Trent.  I want to blow a guy through a wall  doing Amo Nitrate in this song.  Oh, man.  That's kind of cool.  That's kind of cool.  I want to blow a guy through a gun. 
[02:24:00]  I want to blow a guy through a gun.  We drive our ships to New Orleans.  To fight the whole world.  I've seen the cry of the world.  Now, I am coming.  Are the vocals buried or is it my stupid ears?  No, they're buried.  No, that's it.  Every song he does, their vocals are buried. 
[02:24:30]  Musically, I like it.  Yeah, I think it's just different enough that it's good.  That'd be on the drums, yeah.  I wish he would have brought the vocals forward a little bit.  Everything's got to be all distorted and nine-inch Nelzy.  This fucking guy, he won an Oscar, so what do we know?  Yeah, we don't know shite.  He did the music for Social Network.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the arrangement's the same, but I think they change it just now.  I don't like when bands just cover a song just for the sake of covering it. 
[02:25:00]  I do.  Yeah, sometimes.  Well, fine, then we disagree.  Yeah.  Like, there's a Weezer-covered Radiohead, like, last week, and it just sounds, it sounds,  they did a great job covering it, but they didn't change it.  What song?  What song?  Paranoid Android.  Really?  Yeah, it's a good cover, but they didn't.  Let me hear a little of that.  Travis is talking, by the way.  Because I do like Radiohead, and I do like Weezer, so.  You like Weezer?  I should like, yeah, I kind of like Weezer.  Name three songs.  Nah, I can't do that.  Okay.  I couldn't either, by the way. 
[02:25:30]  I like Hash Pipe.  I was calling you out knowing that I don't know three songs either.  Weezer actually has, I'm not a huge fan.  You like their sound?  Is there okay?  Hey.  Go.  No, that's right.  What?  What are you going to ask me?  I was going to interrupt, which is stupid.  No, that's right.  I'll try not to interrupt it.  I like their hits.  That's what I do.  I like hits.  The Weezer did the theme song from.  Oh, no.  Your eyes gave it away.  Oh, no.  Work on the eyes.  They did the theme song from the Bill Tetley Hour. 
[02:26:00]  It's a new variety show.  No, it isn't.  No, they didn't.  Yes, they did.  Stop with the Bill Tetley Hour that you've been pushing.  It's a great show.  We're not acknowledging that Bill Tetley has an hour yet.  He does.  Bill Tetley.  The whole audience wears Hawaiian shirts.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That would be cool, right?  Yeah.  What drug would you need to be on to think an audience of Hawaiian shirts is cool?  Cialis.  I set them up.  You knock them down. 
[02:26:30]  No, I was going to interrupt to ask you, and I don't even know if I get one serious answer  from me today.  You asked me about Filter yesterday.  Yes.  One of the guys from Filter follows you.  The basis, yes.  And he's a fan of the show.  I forget his name.  I happen to just be too tired, but he was very cool.  We used to have a pretty good relationship with those guys.  Filtry.  Filter back when we were in Boston, and there was a time there might have been a chance  for us to do a little something something with the Filter guys, and we chose not to  because we were pussy whipped. 
[02:27:00]  He invited me to the Asbury Park show, which I would love to go to.  Remember, he wanted to do a little of this?  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  And a little of the drinking?  I was beyond doing that at that point, though.  Yeah, I know.  I don't think I would have dipped back into that shit.  I had quite a few years before I had, you know.  And Jimmy goes, are they a good band?  I said, abso-fucking-lutely.  And then I told you to download Take a Picture.  I didn't.  Oh.  But I will.  I was excited that you would immediately and then write me back.  And then we would have a thing, like, we could talk about the song a little bit. 
[02:27:30]  What Filter songs do you like?  Hey Man, Nice Shot, Jimmy, is Filter.  What?  Hey Man, Nice Shot, which is based on the Bud Dwyer incident.  Oh, really?  Okay, cool.  Yeah, that's Filter.  Because then I was trying to remember Filter songs.  I know the band.  I know Hey Man, Nice Shot.  I know Take a Picture, and then I started forgetting the Filter shit.  You know this one.  It's an AAF song.  I hear these songs, and I remember just sitting there. 
[02:28:00]  Sitting at my little fucking thing.  Dave Dickless coming in.  You're talking too much.  That's not going to go anywhere for you guys.  Why don't you do a segment every day, 6 o'clock, about what's happening in the local club scene.  Just got to sit there and mention shit, Boston fans.  Did he actually say that?  Hunk-a-bunk-a.  I don't remember that.  Remember that?  The get-off-your-ass?  Oh, the get-off-your-ass report.  Get-off-your-ass report.  It's like, get-off-your-ass, go-do-something.  And he made me go through the fucking local rag.  I forgot. 
[02:28:30]  And name like, hey, running with scissors is going to be at the rat tonight.  Great.  I forgot.  Fucking blow me.  What a fucking asshole.  Sucked.  Stupid Dave Douglas.  Yeah.  I haven't forgotten.  You got in our ways.  We would have been fucking way.  We would have been big, huge stars a lot sooner if it wasn't for you.  Big stars if it wasn't for him.  You motherfucker.  You did.  You know this song, right, Jimmy?  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Take a picture.  It's kind of wimpy, but I like it.  They like the distorted vocals, too.  The filter.  When he screams, especially.  Oh, I don't like hollering.  It's very distorted right here.  Here we go.  Ah, ah, ah, ah!  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I do like stabbing westward.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, ant, I'm going to bring back some memories because Coke Logic just gave us two more filter  songs that we used to play, ad  nauseam.  I finally figured out how to say  that properly, so now I love using  ad nauseam.  I used to say ad nauseam.  Yes, Jim.  I was just going to say, that helps 
[02:30:00]  any recipe.  Is he doing  Kornak today? Is this Kornak?  It's Kornak, isn't it?  It kind of is, yeah.  Yeah, but I also have a knack  for trucks and buses.  Fucking endless.  Fucking endless.  If you keep track at home,  9.13. Amazing. 
[02:30:30]  He really is amazing  at this.  Ready, Ant? Yeah.  Do you remember Dracetal?  I'm the only station that really rocks by filter.  Let me hear. And Dose.  Dose. We used to do Dose, too,  by filter. We went deep with filter  back in the day. Yeah, yeah.  At AF.  What did you ask me if you remember?  What was the song?  Dose?  What was the other one?  I don't remember.  Jurassicol?  No.  I remember Jurassic a little. 
[02:31:00]  Jurassic is short.  That's stupid.  He's not what he means.  I don't know how to play this.  It's fine.  By the way, Coke Logic,  I just mentioned in him,  Jack Kevorkian dead at 84.  Coke Logic tweets,  he literally died doing what he loved,  dying.  That's very funny.  No one is going to beat that line today  as far as Jack Kevorkian goes.  Congratulations to Coke Logic on Twitter.  Yeah, I played Kevork!  He did.  Yep.  Those platform shoes. 
[02:31:30]  I saw a guy with big platform shoes  last weekend.  Was it Denny Terrio?  This guy's shoes were so fucking big  that they looked like regular sneakers,  but the soles of them,  they were a good two and a half inches far.  And he's just walking around.  And he's still short.  I love going to the beach  with my shorts and platform boots.  People just stare and think I'm an ass,  but I'm comfy.  Because there's only one set of  platform shoe footprints in the sand. 
[02:32:00]  Is that it?  And the Lord said,  that's because I left.  You look like an asshole from the 70s.  Lord, why did you leave me?  My most troubling of times.  Because I had to drop a deuce.  Wow.  I was suicidal  and God was fucking squeezing out  all fucking too dark shit.  Wouldn't that suck?  If you really needed God,  he was fucking stiff-legging on the bowl.  On the bowl.  Stiff-legging.  Giant celestial toilet.  Big God-like legs. 
[02:32:30]  So full of goodness.  Wouldn't that just be the planets?  It's God's demons.  Floating around.  But God is perfect.  He'd have a perfect shit every time.  He probably would.  Each one perfect length.  Taper.  Yes, taper.  Slides right into the bowl.  Bit of a submarine vibe to it.  Good color.  I like when half tries to hide  down the flush hole.  I know.  Exactly.  It reminds me of a sea creature  ready to strike. 
[02:33:00]  A moray eel.  Yeah, or less of one.  It's hoping you don't see it.  I don't love eel.  A moray eel.  Oh, God.  That's a moray eel.  When your log hits the bowl  and the water splashes  to your testicles.  Ah, shit. 
[02:33:30]  Moray.  Fucking hated that song.  Are you a horse's ass today?  I really am.  I love it.  Oh, that fucking song stunk.  That was bad.  Like a big pizza pie.  Exactly.  How about if you really want to  embrace the Italian culture?  When the moon hits your eye  like your husband's fist.  That's a moray.  Who gets fucking hit 
[02:34:00]  with a pizza pie?  No one does.  I don't think that's ever happened.  Unless it was cold.  The bitch brought it out cold.  When the moon hits your eye  like your husband being shot  for not paying gambling debts.  That's a moray.  Hits your eye  like it tampered with jury.  That's a moray.  mean  when the world  seems to shine  like the moon  seems to shine  which one  that's so red  bells lightning 
[02:34:30]  tingling  tingling  and  you sing  be  the  dead  learn  hearts will play  Like a gay tarantella?  A gay tarantula?  When the stars make you drool  Juicy like a pastefas  As-salamore  The fucking songs to whack people 
[02:35:00]  When the stars make your cum  Smell like you're in the ocean  And it's chum  That's amore  That's after you fucker  Old fish pussy  When the ice pick goes in your neck  And your wig falls off like Maury  That's a Maury's wig  That's like Maury  When you want to get Danish for Belle  But your friend of 30 years kills you for talking  That's like Maury  And you know 
[02:35:30]  It was your caper  That's like Maury  When Frans mentions blueberries  That's a snorre  When a girl sneezes on her period  And she's on your shag rug  That's a gory  When your girl gets pregnant 
[02:36:00]  And you don't want to be a dad  You hope it hits the floor  When your asshole is real itchy  And your brother's the coach  You're a Tory  Oh my god  That's an old schooler  I met manager  When you're at a restroom  And you want to find a friend 
[02:36:30]  Just tap over the hole  That's a glory  And if there's no hole  Just slide your feet to his on the floor  When your one friend is dead  And you're really hurting  You're a core  Hooray  Feldman 
[02:37:00]  Feldman  That was fun  Yeah  I despise that song  That is just awful  Yeah truly terrible  Dago fucking tune  Droom  Droom tastes like pasta  Fuzzle  Does it?  Pasta  Fuzzle  Yeah  She's telling you  When you're  When you're pussy drool  When you're sitting there  And your dad throws spaghetti  Against the wall  You just cry like a baby  You're a sissy
