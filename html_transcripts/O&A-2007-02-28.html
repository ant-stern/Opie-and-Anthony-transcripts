<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton ("Sex Vagal"), engaging in typical banter. Opie recounted a sleepless night caused by a supposedly "non-drowsy" sinus medication, generating comedic complaints.  The conversation quickly shifted to Norton’s hilariously disastrous sexual encounter, described using a trampoline analogy – two weak jumps and an abrupt end.  This spawned numerous listener calls, each offering their own "trampoline sex" story, with one caller dubbing Norton "two-jump chump."

The show then transitioned to a discussion of *American Idol*, focusing on the strategic placement of a controversial contestant and the show's ratings manipulation tactics. Suggestive comments about the contestant followed. A significant portion of the broadcast remained focused on the listener calls detailing their own sexual experiences using the trampoline metaphor.  The "Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday" segment followed, showcasing listener-submitted pictures and discussions around women flashing their breasts upon seeing "WOW" stickers on cars.  This evolved into a discussion of "Fatty," a woman on Paltalk, her daily routine, and the hosts' commentary. H-Cup Jane and J-Cup Jen then called in, discussing their breast sizes and "wowing" experiences, leading to further humorous banter comparing their attributes.

The next segment started with a discussion of RateMyWow.com and photos of H-Cup Jane, whose Kansas City breast augmentation surgery surprised the hosts. A call from J-Cup Jen, a Black woman from Hempstead, New York, led to a detour into the abundance of chicken restaurants in her town. The hosts scheduled H-Cup Jane and J-Cup Jen for a "Big Booby Day" appearance the following Wednesday. The conversation then shifted to mocking Al Gore's high electricity bill and Madonna criticizing her daughter's tight jeans, highlighting perceived hypocrisy in both cases.  A substantial portion was dedicated to a conversation with Boardroom Jimmy, a financial expert who offered wildly erratic and offensive stock market advice, suggesting investments in sugar, fish oil, and pencils while insulting bonds and computers with numerous offensive and crass terms.

The show then introduced Brother Joe, who runs a U2 tribute band franchise, and Pavel, a Bono impersonator from Yugoslavia, who shared anecdotes about being mistaken for Bono.  Louis C.K.'s radio advertisement also aired.  Further discussion with Brother Joe followed, detailing his band's success, including playing at Pierce Brosnan's house and a photo shoot requested by Bono himself.  Brother Joe even performed a short U2 song live.  The show included calls from listeners, one of whom disliked a listener-submitted Metallica cover.  Plans for a street stunt involving a Bono impersonator were discussed and subsequently executed live on air, with the hosts providing commentary on the growing crowd.  The segment also included a bet on Twitchels's ability to remain silent and a hampered news segment with Big A and Twitchels, where Twitchels was physically punished for infractions, as was Big A.  Bob Kelly and Jim Norton also made guest appearances for promotional plugs.

The street prank involving the fake Bono on 57th Street in New York City was documented, showing the prank evolving from a small group to a substantial crowd of onlookers.  The hosts, along with their crew (Danny, Sam, and others), guided the impersonator, encouraging participation from an enthusiastic but inept "fan" named E-Rock. The prank included interactions with the crowd, including tourists from Argentina, and a failed attempt to enter a Starbucks.  Offensive language and disparaging remarks were frequent throughout the prank segment.  Following the prank, a call-in segment requested songs for Joe to play.


The final segment opened with listener requests, leading to attempts at playing various rock and metal songs, frequently interrupted by technical difficulties and comedic interruptions.  The discussion included crude commentary on Pantera, Pink Floyd, U2, Led Zeppelin, and Alice in Chains. Guests included Keith, Steve, T-Bone (requesting Pink Floyd), Bill (playing a Yes song), E-Rock, and Brother Joe, who performed with E-Rock and discussed upcoming gigs (including one in Atlantic City with Mini Kiss).  Paul Mahas and Brian DeVoe were also mentioned as part of Brother Joe's bands.  The hosts engaged in rambling conversations about live versus studio recordings, Robert Plant's appearance, a caller's dream, the stock market, and a Maxim Magazine event. Catherine was also briefly mentioned as a caller. The segment concluded with a chaotic attempt at a U2 song, more off-key singing, and final banter before ending the show, with a poker game at Opie's house planned for the following day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face. How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagal here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagal. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Sex Vagal gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.  Sell everything. Sell, sell, sell.  Bye, bye.  Sell, sell. 
[00:01:00]  I say sell. Just sell everything.  No, buy now.  Bye now.  Now we buy?  Good buying opportunity.  As soon as we start buying, everybody will be selling.  Going to get the...  What happened?  Going to get the bounce.  The dead animal bounce.  Don't they call it the black cat bounce?  The dead cat.  Now you're going to get the bounce.  I don't know.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi. 
[00:01:30]  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  And I am a dope.  Thank you.  What happened?  Well, I've had a really, really, really heavy cold the last three days.  And I talked to you last night.  Ant and I just shooting the S.  Yeah.  Shooting the crap.  Yeah.  And it's about, what, I think 7.30 and Anthony goes, I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.  And I hung up with you and I'm thinking, you know what, that sounds like a great idea. 
[00:02:00]  Just one of those days where I want to get to bed and get to bed early, go to sleep.  I'm thinking to actually go to bed and get eight hours of sleep.  Get a good night's sleep.  That would be awesome.  Wouldn't it?  So I took my own shower there, Anthony.  Very good.  And then I decided to take a sinus Tylenol, non-drowsy formula.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, see?  That's where you made your mistake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No sleepy for me.  Oh, those things are meant to keep you awake.  Oh, man.  I put earplugs in.  I put a little, like, blindfold on.  I took the earplugs out.  I threw on a rain CD.  I tried everything.  It doesn't matter when you're doing crystal meth because that's pretty much what you were doing. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I just stared at the ceiling for eight hours.  I think I slept the last, like, two or three hours of the night.  That's it.  That is it.  How annoyed were you?  So annoyed.  That is not fun.  I'm thinking non-drowsy doesn't mean it's, like, keeping you awake.  I'm just thinking it doesn't put you to sleep.  No, non-drowsy is pretty much you got a cold.  Your sinuses are all stuffed.  You're feeling drowsy because of your cold, and they want you to stay awake.  You know, you got to maybe drive a truck or, you know, work in the warehouse or somewhere 
[00:03:30]  where you can be dozing off.  Oh, I'm in my early 30s now, and I'm just learning this.  Yeah, just learning it.  Well, you'll learn as you get older.  Maybe when you get into your 40s, you'll know this.  Yeah, stupid me.  I'm thinking, all right, it's non-drowsy.  It's just, you know, it's not going to put you to sleep at night.  Non-drowsy.  Or during the day or whatever.  It shouldn't mean no sleepy.  Right.  Right.  Because I wasn't tired.  I was just normal, Todd. 
[00:04:00]  You know what I mean?  I was just normal.  You know, if you go to sleep that early, though, you could take whatever.  Take NyQuil.  Take the real deal, and you will be out before your head hits the pillow.  Love that stuff.  I should have taken Tylenol PM.  That stuff should be illegal.  Yeah, that stuff, same stuff.  You take it, and you're gone.  You're out.  You should have to see a doctor before you get some of that Tylenol PM.  That stuff is amazing.  You walk down the street, people offer to sell it to you. 
[00:04:30]  It's that good.  Hey, you want some?  Want some?  Got some PM.  Yeah, so I did the non-drowsy, and boy, am I paying for that right now.  Now you're drowsy.  You should take it now.  I'm not drowsy.  I think I'm still speeding, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Because I took two more, because now I've got to work.  You're going to have the crash.  Not that this is work, but you'll have the big crash.  I'll have the crash around 10 a.m., I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be like, oh, God, I need more drugs.  And then I'm coming into work today going, why won't I take one lousy sick day? 
[00:05:00]  One sick day.  Stay at home with a blankie.  Not allowed.  And movies all day.  Just one lousy day.  Won't allow it.  Management won't allow it.  For some reason, they got us all paranoid around here.  Yeah, about taking a day or something.  That is not good to take a day off ever, ever, ever.  No.  Keep working.  Must stay every day.  And I used to, boy, when I was working for a living, oh, my God, the sick days I would take. 
[00:05:30]  I barely remember putting in a full week.  At least once a week, I would take a day or at least half a day, come in really late.  Yeah.  Something like that.  But this, whoa, don't take a day.  Get up.  Get in there.  Go get them, boys.  Entertain America.  Come on.  Well, we'll entertain you guys.  What's up, Jimmy?  Everything all right with you?  I feel good.  I had what could be the worst sex in North America last night. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, wow.  I was so awful.  I called my girlfriend.  But isn't sex like pizza?  All right.  Yes.  No, why is it bad, though?  It was your fault?  Oh, 100%.  That was so awful.  I told her, you can go out and sleep with somebody else once, and I'll have nothing to say about it.  That was your get-out-of-jail-free card for one free sex with a real man.  But you're on to something.  What defines bad sex?  Okay, I'll tell you.  Okay.  Were you able to have sex, first of all?  Yes.  Listen to this. 
[00:06:30]  Picture getting onto a trampoline, and you're going to have fun, and you jump twice, and  then your body is...  Both times that you jump, your body is not standing up as straight as it should be anyway.  Right.  Like, you know, just no bones in your body, jumping.  Yeah, you're just all slumped over on the trampoline.  You're slumped over and mushy.  Right.  You jump twice, and then you can't jump anymore because something happened.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[00:07:00]  So it was a night of just trying to jump on a trampoline?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  No, it was a night of, actually, he jumped on the trampoline a couple of times, and then  there was no reason to jump on the trampoline anymore.  Oh, okay, I got it.  He had all the fun he needed on the trampoline.  I thought he got two jumps, and then...  Even though his form on the trampoline wasn't even good.  Yeah, my form was awful, and then the two jumps ended the entire competition anyway.  I told her, I was embarrassed. 
[00:07:30]  I'm very rarely embarrassed.  I was like, I stink.  Thank God I have above the neck.  Above the neck is everything.  Below the neck, I'm garbage.  You can put my head on anything, and it'd be better than what it's on right now.  Was it, dude, some kind of...  Had you been worked up with the thought of trampolining earlier in the day?  Yeah, usually that's a sign of not trampolining for a while.  Maybe you hadn't been on the trampoline in a while, and the trampoline was very fun and  exciting. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  You know what happens?  I think that a lot of times I don't trampoline.  It's not the trampolining.  It's the fact...  It's all the rehearsing I do for the trampolining by myself.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, you're jumping on the sidelines a little too much.  Yeah, a lot of that.  Virtual trampolining.  You got jumpy sneakers.  Oh, I was embarrassed.  You got a pogo stick on the side.  He's playing a trampoline video game on his computer.  Yeah.  And that's all fine and well, but then when you actually get to the real trampoline, it 
[00:08:30]  could be an issue.  Yeah.  Did she pet your hair and go, that's okay?  Yeah.  That's okay, sweetie.  That's okay.  You could trampoline again later or something.  We laughed about it.  Don't you worry about that.  Laughed about it.  I kept apologizing.  She's like, what are you sorry for?  Oh, God.  It was atrocious.  I'm like, look, that stunk.  We both know it.  And she's like, no, it didn't.  She's like, sometimes I like it a bit longer, but I mean...  A bit. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, it was horrifying.  Did she go, no, I actually find that really hot.  Oh, do you?  Oh, yeah.  Do you really?  Yeah, sure you do.  Suburban dolt I am.  Relax, little lady.  Ah, Jimmy.  That was the best.  Wow.  Well, let's go to Howard Beach.  Let's say hi to Vinny D.  Vinny. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, it's Vinny D.  Vinny, you keeping the neighborhood safe or what, Vinny?  Am I?  Yeah, you representing?  You keeping that neighborhood safe in Howard Beach?  I'm trying, I'm trying.  Someone has to step up for Fat Nick.  That's right.  A little inside stuff for New York.  Go ahead, Vinny.  What do you got?  I just wanted to call Jimmy a two-jump chump.  A two-jump chump.  Oh, dude.  That's what they call him.  The jumps were sloppy.  Really?  My form was awful.  Your form was terrible.  Oh, it was awful. 
[00:10:00]  Dude, two countries know now that you're the two-jump chump.  I am the two-jump chump.  And normally I'm not.  Normally I jump a little longer.  Yeah.  Not necessarily better, but at least a little longer.  Were you at least jumping up and down, like straight up and down?  Oh, no.  Was there anything different going on?  Were you doing some somersaults or something different that might have been very exciting  to do on a trampoline?  I didn't have enough time to get any somersaults in.  Yeah.  I mean, before, just looking at the trampoline, maybe the anticipation of jumping on it. 
[00:10:30]  Sometimes that'll get somebody, just the look of the trampoline.  It'll be like, wow, this is going to be great.  Yeah.  Oh, before I actually, typically what I'll do before I jump on the trampoline is I like  to just relax and smash my face into the trampoline a whole bunch of times because I find  that tests the buoyancy.  And I did enjoy doing that, and thank God, again, above the neck.  Right, right.  So after the two jumps, did you go into another leisure activity? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It was called make sure that the trampoline, you know, after the trampoline, you have to  grab a towel and clean that trampoline off.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of, sure.  The next gymnast may injure themselves.  Yeah.  So that's what I did.  It's always good to clean off the equipment.  Absolutely.  Whether it's in a gym or at home on your trampoline.  And I was apologizing profusely and truly embarrassed.  Wow.  Truly embarrassed.  Did you turn all red?  I wouldn't know the lights were out. 
[00:11:30]  I was just ashamed.  Ashamed.  Oh, wow.  Did you feel like you were 13?  Oh.  It was like you want to laugh it off at first, and then you just like laugh it off, stupid,  but that did just happen.  Yeah.  You can play it all.  How about this?  Why didn't you just wait a little while and get back on that trampoline?  Because the neighbors are complaining if you're trampolining at 1.20 in the morning  when you have to be up at 5.15, you're like, you know what? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  No more trampolining for the kid tonight.  You know what?  What about the fact that, you know, you've felt all this fun and excitement when you're  on the trampoline, couldn't you have just stopped bouncing on the trampoline for a couple  of seconds when you felt that you were feeling so, having so much fun on the trampoline?  Maybe you could stop and just stand on the trampoline for a second?  Dude, you had two jumps, man.  I mean, come on.  Two jumps doesn't give you any chance to jump off the trampoline and land safely. 
[00:12:30]  It's not like that kind of excitement completely creeps up on you, though.  Two, though.  I tried stopping on the trampoline.  Yeah.  I tried stopping, but all of a sudden, my body was stopping, but my one leg just kept  jumping.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Oh, it doesn't even matter that you stopped.  No, it didn't matter.  You would have had to have gotten off of the trampoline, and sometimes a simple act of  getting off of the trampoline might be a problem.  Yeah, yeah, without a doubt. 
[00:13:00]  I mean, I jumped on the trampoline, and then just getting off the trampoline, things happen.  I don't know what happened.  They had to call the paramedics.  It was a big action.  The action of the trampoline, sorry.  Oh, Jimmy.  Poor Jimmy.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, well, Jimmy, maybe this will make you feel a little better.  I just got my copy of Lucky Louie on DVD, and episode 13 was absolutely hilarious.  The scene with you guys at the lunch counter in your face when he says, she did it to me 
[00:13:30]  once when I was dressed up like the clown, priceless.  Thank you, sir.  That's something that made me feel good due to my sexual inadequacy and almost impotence at one point, a series that was canceled.  Thanks.  That's another example of not being on the trampoline long enough in one season.  Poor Jimmy.  Hey, I did get back up and watch that dumb American Idol.  Oh, you watched it?  And that's our discussion for today. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, that's it.  Well, it's a hot show.  You want to discuss it a little bit because the people out there are watching.  I'll make one observation.  One observation?  Yeah.  Something interesting?  Yeah.  Something different.  What about Sanjay or Sanjay?  I could give a crap what anyone was doing.  Is that kid getting, I'll say this much, is that kid getting gayer and gayer as the weeks go on?  I just saw him come out in his little costume and that was it.  I just knew what he was all about.  No, it has nothing to do with the singing competition or anything.  It has something to do with the fact that the people that run Idol are very smart. 
[00:14:30]  They put that girl, that girl that's all the controversy with the sex pictures and everything.  And we learned yesterday.  The guys were singing.  Hold on really fast.  We learned yesterday the X-rated pictures are not her.  We felt really, really stupid yesterday.  Well, the hard R's are her.  The hard R's are her.  But the X-rated aren't her.  So they have the girls watch the guys sing.  And that's what happened last night.  The guys were singing.  I guess the girls sing tonight.  But as the guys were singing, they showed the girls.  And front and center, front row, there's two rows of the girls. 
[00:15:00]  And right in the middle, there she was.  They put her right there where when they even went to the girls for a split second, your eyes were drawn right to her.  You knew exactly which one it was.  And she's smiling and clapping and everything and watching the guys.  And you're just looking like, you little whore.  She's one of the worst singers but the promo for tonight's show.  It's all her.  Of course.  They're smart.  Everyone's going to be watching tonight. 
[00:15:30]  I know.  I mean, you watched last night because you thought she was singing.  Yeah.  It's the only reason.  See, they got Anthony hooked.  It's the only reason.  I'll watch tonight until she sings and then click.  Yeah.  Care.  All right.  Let's say hi to Max of Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes.  Next time you have that problem, maybe you should take a lozenge.  A lozenge?  A lozenge.  Maybe some lozenges.  We found out yesterday during the tail end of our show that we like the word lozenges. 
[00:16:00]  Like sucretes is a lozenge.  But when there's a few of them in the box, it's even more fun to say lozenges.  It's not lozenger.  You have to end it with jill.  Yeah, because it's a lozenge.  Lozenge.  It's not a lozenger.  So you can't say lozengers.  It's lozenges.  Lozenge.  It's almost upsetting to say it.  The word gives up on you.  Yeah.  It's lozenge.  Lozenge.  Oh, it's an awful word.  Just when you're supposed to finish strong. 
[00:16:30]  Sorry, Jimmy.  But I said that.  Oh.  Just when you're supposed to finish strong with the word, it just tails off.  Lozenge.  Lozenge.  I'm sorry.  That only doesn't happen.  Did you think how just some guy and some leotard can be jumping on the trampoline and doing pike position things and flips and just going, boing, boing.  Just jumping.  Jumping at will.  With his form.  His back completely straight. 
[00:17:00]  Boing, boing, boing.  I picture just, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  Perfect form.  Perfect form.  All day long.  Kids are coming and going.  Birthday parties.  It doesn't matter.  He's still jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping.  This guy's undistractable.  And when he finally gets off, he goes, grabs maybe a glass of lemonade, and he's right back on it.  Gets off of the trampoline.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Has a little refreshment, and he's right back on there.  Right.  Did I think of that?  Yeah.  And I thought of her history in the circus. 
[00:17:30]  Let's say hi to Stacey in Jersey.  She's going to make you feel good.  Little Jimmy Norton is sad today, Stacey.  What's up?  I just wanted me to know that sometimes it's a little flattering to know that you can make  a guy fall off the trampoline so fast.  Thank you very much, and I would agree with you.  Had my form on the trampoline not been the same form that you'd have at the funeral of  a grandparent, I would say that perhaps it would have been complimentary. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, but no.  Being that I was struggling in every sense of the word as a man.  Wow.  Well, do you funeral them every time?  No, no, no.  I don't.  Yes, he does.  Yeah, he does.  I'm surprised when I get out of bed, my legs didn't collapse like a quadriplegic.  Like a newborn calf.  Can't even do that, right?  I couldn't even.  All right, Stacey.  Some girl's flattered when you just can't really do the trampoline.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jody in Michigan.  Jody.  A couple of jumps. 
[00:18:30]  Jody.  Hello, guys.  What's up, Jody?  I just wanted to tell Jimmy, don't feel bad.  I was on my pogo stick this weekend, and he asked me if I touched the sky, and I told  him no.  Oh, really?  Wait, what?  She's saying that basically she had her and her friend had a trampoline competition, and  he asked her, did she touch the sky?  And she said no, she didn't.  Apparently not.  Oh, boy.  Apparently she wasn't as thrilled to be on the trampoline.  Is Jody saying she can only get like a foot or two off the trampoline? 
[00:19:00]  It was good, though.  You didn't reach very, very high heights.  It wasn't Olympic gold, you know?  All right.  Why would you even have asked her, did you hit the sky?  Why would I ask her that?  She didn't break a sweat.  Oh.  Hit the sky.  But she all confused, like, what happened?  What happened?  I'll put it to you this way.  And then you've got to cover up your nude body awkwardly.  Oh, I shame shuffled. 
[00:19:30]  And just shuffle away to the bathroom.  Shame shuffled.  And then slam the door real hard.  No, I couldn't have done anything that right.  I went to slam the door, and it just kind of limply went.  Hey, there's a lot of people out there that had bad sex, too.  Why don't we talk to them?  What?  All right.  Hey, did you have bad sex?  What are you talking about?  They're right there.  Look at this.  We've got to take a break.  Well, Jimmy wasn't even talking about that.  Talking about a trampoline?  Well, that's what I mean.  Jumping on a trampoline.  If you understand why sex has to even be brought into the conversation today. 
[00:20:00]  If you've had a bad trampolining experience in the last few days, or especially last night,  what's wrong, Jimmy?  Honestly, she had a dream about me the night before.  Oh, yeah?  Was it good or a bad dream?  No, it wasn't good.  No?  No.  What was the dream?  I don't know.  It was weird.  I'm a dream analysis.  Okay.  Yeah.  Part of it I did figure out. 
[00:20:30]  How do you put this?  She said that there was another man dominating me in it.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Wait.  Your girlfriend is dreaming that another man was taking you.  No, no, no.  Not that far.  The dream analysis.  No.  It was off-duty.  I am.  Dominating you.  Yeah.  In what fashion?  In a fashion where maybe you wouldn't be able to recite the ABCs. 
[00:21:00]  No, not that far.  Why did you give the sign of hit the road, Jack?  Wait, huh?  Yeah, when Ant says in which way did he dominate you, you gave the hit the road.  Oh, no.  What fashion?  Oh, okay.  I was probably gesturing you.  What fashion was he dominating you?  Kind of like the one where you couldn't see your ABCs, but not that much.  Which almost like, you ever carry like click clacks in a, when I was a boy I had a pack  of click clacks I would carry in a little pouch.  Yeah, yeah.  I would never want to.  And she had the weird dream that this stranger was carrying this funny toy, this click clacks 
[00:21:30]  in a pouch.  I used to have those as a kid.  They're a great toy.  Yeah, it is a great toy.  Yeah.  You bang them together and make this weird toy.  Yeah, sure.  And she was dreaming that this man had these weird click clacks in this stupid carrying  pouch and was rubbing them on my face.  You are in the weirdest relationship ever.  Ever.  Oh, man, Jim.  In her dream, she said, I was wondering, why is this going on? 
[00:22:00]  Like, and I'm thinking, do these two think that I like this?  I didn't like it.  Do these two think?  I don't think Jimmy likes it either.  I didn't care for it either, hon.  Oh, my God.  Why would she dream that?  I don't know.  And then she's like, I dreamt that we were...  Why would she tell you?  Well, that was a weird dream.  She just, you know, she said she was trying to get away.  She's in my apartment.  She just wanted to be alone.  So she walks into my bedroom and there's all these couples having sex in my bedroom and she just  couldn't be alone and she was really freaking out and it was frustrating.  That I analyzed pretty easily.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Well, how'd you analyze it?  What is going on there?  I don't know about the click-clacks thing, but if you're dreaming that you're in my bedroom  and you can't be alone, that's probably uncomfortable with my past or things like that.  Like, I just want to be alone in this guy's bedroom with him.  And I can't be alone and comfortable.  There's other things going on.  Or whatever.  Right?  That I can't get rid of.  It probably means nothing like that, though.  It probably means something about she's having fears about her job futures.  Yeah.  No, that's...  It's always...  It always has nothing to do with the obvious. 
[00:23:00]  She has a big career decision to make.  That's all it is.  That's right.  This is so obviously that there's demons in the room.  It's my past and stuff.  No.  Should she stay in New York or move to L.A.?  That's all it's about.  She was deciding on shoes at a store, and she thinks she went with the wrong pair.  Stupid dreams.  Dreams are awful.  I'll bet you the click-clacks thing is how she views me in light of other men, though.  Like, that's what they do to me, like, just in the whole theme of life.  Yeah, that kind of...  That would seem to be the first thing you would think is you're just being emasculated like  that and kind of, wow, that is a bad one. 
[00:23:30]  She said she didn't like seeing me submissive at all.  That's worse than the typical...  Like, because everything else is hack.  Like, if your girlfriend dreams that a guy is doing something to you that perhaps he  should be doing to a girl, that's like almost hack dream stuff.  But that is original and weird.  I don't know what it means.  Oh, old washcloth and just washing Jimmy's face.  I know, with onion juice.  Get it out. 
[00:24:00]  I don't want my face washed.  All right, look, we don't even have to give the phone number out, but we should give  it out for maybe a future date when you're going to need it.  1-866-313-FREE.  The phones are lit from all over the country and a lot of bad trampolining going on out  there, Jimmy.  One guy, hopefully we'll get to him next, fell off bed and sprained wrist before sex last  night.  Oh.  We'll talk to Larry and everybody else.  Larry.  On the Opie and Anthony show next.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker, get flashed, get happy.

We're talking about trampolines this morning. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  With little Jimmy Norton.  The instant feedback's coming in like crazy.  Go to opieandanthony.com.  There's an instant feedback link there.  And you can comment about the things we're talking about right on the spot.  Yeah.  It's funny.  Every morning we get in the studio around 5.55.  We're in another room for an hour or so before that.  But it's really funny to read the instant feedback from like 11 o'clock last night, 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  It's instant feedback.  It's very useful when we're live.  And you like what we're talking about or you don't like what we're talking about.  And then you write a quick comment.  And some of these comments make the air.  But when we're off the air, no one's really there to read it.  No, I mean, it was very rare that I actually was scanning the instant feedback before we started the show today.  Anyway, Eric in Phillytown listening on WYSP.  A little thing for Jimmy.  And this guy's got it all wrong.  Maybe the trampoline was too stretched out. 
[00:26:00]  What?  Wouldn't the trampoline be too tight?  Yeah, the springs would be much too tight.  The springs are a little too tight.  It would give you more bounce and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it had nothing to do with the trampoline.  And maybe the springs need a little oil.  Yeah.  Just a little oil.  Yeah.  That would...  The guy's got it all wrong.  I'd love to blame the equipment.  Believe me.  Yeah.  No, how can I?  Yeah, it was my incompetent gymnastic skills.  What do you think?  That's not the first trampoline ride I've ever taken.  Yeah.  That might be the worst, but I believe it's not the first. 
[00:26:30]  You've pretty much tried out every trampoline.  And no demand.  I've tried a lot of trampolines.  Nothing worse than when you jump on a trampoline and someone has less than a cone on it.  You're like, oh my God, I didn't realize this was on the trampoline.  Oh, well, here we are.  You've also done the one-person trampoline.  What do you mean?  This is a one-person trampoline.  It's not that big.  And you just boing, boing, boing by yourself.  Many times.  And then we got Coke Logic.  He's always good for one from whackbag.com.  Jimmy is worried about her time in the circus.  You said that.  Yes. 
[00:27:00]  But what about his experience with bearded ladies?  Ah, well.  That just hurt.  That was not nice, sir.  When you go to jump on a trampoline and there's no spring whatsoever and it just hits the floor and you're standing there.  What the hell is this?  A lot of different types of trampolines that have to be kept in a certain order.  Have you ever been in a trampoline in the backyard where no one has really used a trampoline in a long time and the grass has pretty much taken over the trampoline? 
[00:27:30]  You barely even know how to get on the damn thing.  Overgrown with weeds.  Garbage.  What are you doing?  Throwing sardine oil all over the place?  Yeah.  But how happy are you when you go in that backyard and it's a brand new trampoline?  The lawn's been mowed.  Right out of the box.  It's on asphalt. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Larry on Long Island.  Hi, Rick.  You're on the O.P. and Anthony Show, Larry.  What's up?  Hi, Larry.  Larry!  Gave him the big plug before the break and everything.  It's always the way.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, let's go, Larry.  Okay, sorry about that.  Two quick things.  How are you guys?  Jimmy, I did buy the Lucky Louie CD last week and it's awesome.  Hopefully they come to their senses, put that show back on.  Thank you, buddy.  The second thing before the trampoline is I think John and Jeff need to be cash traded. 
[00:28:30]  Why?  They suck so bad.  And it's terrible because I'm up early in the morning on Wednesdays and going back from  6.60 a.m.  I accidentally, once in a while, I put them on just the past time.  Not accidentally, obviously, but they're just so annoying.  I hate them.  I just can't stand them.  John and Jeff are on before us here in New York City and I think in a few other cities.  They are just horrific.  Horrible.  They're live in L.A.  It makes me feel good about what we do. 
[00:29:00]  That's their job in the radio world, to realize that we're good at this.  It is.  Because no one else is telling us these days.  You guys know I think you guys are fantastic.  They're so nice.  Last night, my wife takes the kids upstairs, tucks them into bed, and I think she's still  up there.  So I have one of those small trampolines in my bedroom.  So I go inside, pop in my favorite do-it-yourself trampoline video.  Right.  And everything's going smooth.  Next thing I know, I hear a couple of footsteps inside the hallway, thought I heard a creak  of a door, slip off the trampoline, break my wrist, and hear my wife yell, you better 
[00:29:30]  not be jumping on that damn trampoline by yourself again.  Oh, boy.  She gets mad when you go trampolining without her, right?  Exactly.  Yeah.  My girlfriend does, too.  Why do girls get mad at that?  Because the trampoline videos are typically going to be a lot different than the activity  that you're doing with them.  Yeah.  And you could be, you know, jumping on the real trampoline.  Yeah.  Instead of that little one-person one.  Right.  Well, sometimes you want to practice your jumping, though. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, but it's bad when you're on a real trampoline.  All you can think about is that trampolining video you were watching.  Thanks, guys.  Have a great morning.  All right.  Let's say hi to Stacy in Brooklyn.  Stacy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Wow.  Representing Brooklyn.  What's up?  Representing.  Nothing.  Good morning.  I was just calling to tell you, like, my boyfriend and I, it was a pivotal moment.  We were trying for the championship in trampolining, and it was a pivotal moment for the gold.  And unfortunately, my boyfriend was too nervous and couldn't stick the landing for a couple 
[00:30:30]  of days.  Oh.  Couldn't stick the landing?  Wow.  Couldn't stick the landing.  No.  Sometimes pressure builds up.  Oh, wow.  So it was a really, it was good trampolining, but you did the very end of it, just couldn't  quite do it.  You needed it for the metal.  Stick the landing.  Yeah.  Do the end of the routine.  Yes.  And it was, it didn't fulfill my needs for the month, if you know what I'm saying.  You do.  All right.  Hang in there, Stacy.  Thank you.  Let's go to Sabrina in Virginia.  Sabrina, what's up? 
[00:31:00]  Hi, Jimmy.  First, I just want to tell you that I love you, and don't worry about it.  I'm actually getting divorced from somebody who couldn't even climb on the trampoline.  Why?  What was, uh...  We're watching a video right now on Fox.  There's a bunch of kids trampolining.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Fat kid trampolining.  It's that fat kid in England, and he's trampolining.  Look at these.  Is that what you looked like last night, Jimmy?  He's falling over trampolining, and he's better at it than I was.  Little fat eight-year-old.  Look, and they're laughing at him.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the fat kid that they were going to take away from his mom. 
[00:31:30]  They came back, and the anchor woman is laughing at him on the trampoline.  What the hell kind of irony is this?  You can't laugh at an eight-year-old who's over 200 pounds falling down on a trampoline.  But they decided the mom could keep the kid.  Yeah.  Because I guess they were blaming the mom, uh...  For making the kid fat.  Yeah, exactly.  He's a mess, that kid.  All right, back to Sabrina.  So, Sabrina, are you getting a divorce because husband can't even bounce on the trampoline?  Right.  And you know what? 
[00:32:00]  I'm not even going to deal with men anymore.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  What are you going to go?  You're one of those, huh?  Oh.  Yeah, I found the girl who bounces better.  Wow.  Okay.  It happened many more times than once.  So, Jimmy, just don't worry.  All right, hold on, Sabrina.  Let's slow this down a little bit.  So, is that the reason why your husband can't get on the trampoline?  Because he realizes that you're not into the sport anymore? 
[00:32:30]  Well, yeah.  Is he worried that your friend is trampolined and does it better because they have artificial  limbs?  No.  No, actually, I had never trampolined with a woman until just recently.  All right.  Where was it?  Oh, what do you mean?  No, like, give us some details.  Listen to her just laughing.  No wonder he can't trampoline.  Yeah.  He's like, cackling.  No.  No, actually, well, we trampolined at my house. 
[00:33:00]  Is it a friend?  Is it a neighbor?  Well, she's a friend.  Was it just a girlfriend, a good friend over the years, or someone you had your eye on?  Actually, it was somebody that I got hooked up with.  By who?  Hooked up with.  By another friend of mine that likes trampolining with girls.  Oh, that's interesting.  Were you drunk?  No.  Are you drunk?  Jesus.  She's a cackler.  Man, I want to get a good story out of you, but I don't know if we could get past the laughing. 
[00:33:30]  Are you nervous?  No, I'm just very happy.  All right.  So how did this come about?  You got hooked up.  So what, you got to dinner?  Yes, we did.  All right, and then back to your house?  Yep.  And then what happened?  Like some kind of no drinks, I guess, if you aren't drunk.  Well, we did drink.  I just wasn't over-served.  How do you then get from the point where you're just hanging out to the point where you're like,  hey, let's jump around a little bit? 
[00:34:00]  She jumped around quite a bit before.  Yeah, but what's the move?  At that moment, I'm not talking about this vague thing here.  At the moment where it went down, how does that happen?  Exactly.  I figured after the marriage that I had, I'd give it a shot.  She's not understanding my question.  Sabrina, you got to listen to me a minute.  Do you understand?  That second, I'm talking about the actual instance.  It's like talking about the Kennedy assassination and saying, right when the bullet struck his 
[00:34:30]  head and then going, well, he arrived at the airport in Dallas.  And we want to know about when the bullet hit the head.  What happened at that moment?  Like, how does that move get made that you guys did what you did?  Hello?  I don't, I'm one of those stupid girls now.  Yeah, you really, you really are.  She's not understanding the, you're saying how did it actually happen with her and the 
[00:35:00]  girl together?  Yeah, I want to know at the actual event, you're sitting there, maybe on the couch, you're at  your apartment.  How does it go from that to something a little more intimate?  Yeah, you guys went out to dinner, you went back to your house, your husband obviously  wasn't home, right?  Right.  So how did it go down?  Well, we knew it was going to go down pretty much from when we left.  This could be the worst lesbian story ever.  Yeah, I, I, now it could be the hottest one if she ever did get to it. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  But, um, it's so annoying.  How do you make a lesbian, first time lesbian experience sound awful?  So wait, you're not giving us any information that we can use.  I don't know how much I can say.  Just say what happened.  Believe me, at this point, I'm just talking about who, like, who made the move on who?  Oh, she did.  All right, and how did that happen?  We just, it just happened. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, my God.  So it just happened.  You blacked out.  You were sitting on the couch.  You blacked out and woke up and things were happening.  That's your description you just gave me.  No, we walked in.  We started making out.  All right.  Oh, it only took four minutes to get to that point.  You start making out.  That's, that's kind of nice.  You know that lesbian stories, especially first time lesbian stories are home runs in radio?  Yeah.  Usually.  Usually. 
[00:36:30]  My God, Sabrina.  All right, so what happened?  You start making out.  Making out.  And then where, where did you go?  Well, we just started walking up the stairs.  Oh, my.  Walking up the stairs to the bedroom.  Okay, so now you're in the bedroom, and she's more aggressive than you are?  Yes.  All right.  So now you're kissing.  Now you're still fully clothed?  At the, yeah, at that point, yes.  Okay.  Now, how does that get a resolution? 
[00:37:00]  How to, how to, who starts the disrobing process?  Well, she started disrobing me.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Do you have a nice body?  Oh, yeah.  Do you want numbers?  Well, usually that's what we're getting at.  Well, just some kind of description, maybe a celebrity you'll look like or something like  that.  But thank God we all have TVs in our cars now, so we know what you look like.  So I guess we don't need you to describe yourself.  Well, no, I, I don't really have a celebrity that I look like, but I have a nice figure. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, 1958, let's go.  Can you give us, can you give us some numbers?  Nice figure.  Nice figure.  I hear you're dishy.  Well, 5'7".  She's buxom.  5'7".  130.  130.  I don't have a large chest, though.  No large chest.  No.  All right.  That means you do a lot more sexually.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  And then who took care of who first? 
[00:38:00]  Or did you?  She did.  All right.  So she was absolutely the aggressor, took care of you first.  And at that point, you started to realize, hmm, men pretty much out of the question now.  Yeah.  And then did you reciprocate?  No, because she was too tired.  Wow.  Oh, what a giving girl.  Was she a lipstick lesbian, or was she dykey?  She's kind of in between, and I'm kind of more lipstick. 
[00:38:30]  So now, have you since reciprocated?  Not yet.  Oh, not yet.  So you don't even know what that part's like?  Yeah, no.  Interesting, interesting.  You might go back to men.  Are you going to go back to this?  If you don't know.  Are you going to go back to this woman, or are you going to find another one?  Oh, no, I'm going back for seconds on that one.  And is this planned for the near future?  Friday.  Friday.  Oh, okay. 
[00:39:00]  Well, geez, call us Monday and let us know how your cab ride went.  All right.  You kind of pulled it out there, Sabrina.  Not really.  Beginning of your story really sucked.  No, it's barely, yeah, it was more just barely passing.  I'll make it up to you when I have better news on Monday.  All right.  For the guys that have a really good imagination out there, they had a great time with Sabrina  and her story, but in general, that sucked.  Let's go to Laura. 
[00:39:30]  Laura in East Hampton.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I have what you guys need.  I have a better story.  All right.  You know what we're looking for, right?  Yeah, this is how it happens.  You're down at the Jersey Shore and you're hanging out with your best friend.  And, you know, there are people around and you're having a few drinks.  She's maybe had a little bit too much wine.  You're tired.  You go upstairs.  Next thing you know, you wake up to the sound of your best friend going,  and you just kind of feel us writhing around, writhing around next to you. 
[00:40:00]  And you turn over.  You realize your friend's a little drunk.  Maybe she's having a hard time.  Are you okay?  It's just kind of not even coherent.  You're a little bit tired.  And you lie on your back.  It's interesting.  What's going on with your best friend?  Next thing you know, you feel her fingers on your trampoline. 
[00:40:30]  And it's kind of nice, but it's weird because she's your best friend.  She's like, oh, no, no, stop, stop, stop.  She won't stop coming to your backyard, your asphalt backyard, on your trampoline.  And so, you know, you're kind of drifting back to sleep.  But you turn over to your side with your back to her. 
[00:41:00]  But at the same time, all of a sudden, you're undoing the drawstring to your trampoline  because maybe she'll do the reach around, which she does.  And the next thing you know, she's in your trampoline.  And that's how it happens.  And there's some kissing, you know, on the neck.  Next thing you know, your pajama pants are around your trampoline. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, we understand.  We understand.  I don't think the trampoline thing is working with your story.  I don't know.  I really don't.  Wow.  You have to keep it in trampoline terms.  Wow.  That is well, uh, throw that trampoline out the window.  Right there's the trampoline jumping so high.  The trampoline itself is in the air.  Yeah.  And it's nice.  Well, I like her description of how it happens.  A little bit of drunk in there.  There, you know, she kind of passes out.  And then all of a sudden, her friend is there.  She wakes up, and her friend is really having a great time. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, she wakes up, because she's hearing stuff from her friend that's right next door.  And her friend starts trying to do some things, and things happen.  Yeah, sure.  Even if it's your best friend, and you generally like that guy in the leotard whose posture  is pinned straight.  Yeah.  But, you know.  Was she good, though?  Did you enjoy kissing her?  Oh, yeah.  I was kissing.  You know, nice, light, girly kisses.  Was that the first time for you, Laura?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  And the last, but there's nothing better than sometimes when...  It was just one of those things, huh?  The stars aligned for Laura down at the old Jersey Shore.  That Jersey Shore will do it.  Yep.  Thank you, you guys.  Thank you, Laura.  Thank you.  Thank you, Laura.  Sabrina, that's how you tell a story.  That's how you tell it.  Boy, she did it like a surgeon, came in and removed the gay from the show.  Oh, yeah, she did.  Did most of that get out there? 
[00:43:00]  I have no idea.  All right, very good.  I liked her description of what her friend sounded like.  That was nice.  Someone's saying, Jim, you're...  All right, hold on.  Let's go to Jim in Jersey.  Jim, real fast, because we've got to take a break for a minute or two.  Yeah, I just, you know, I didn't catch the tail end of that story, but boy, that first  lesbian story was the worst one I think I've ever heard.  Okay, because it says the worst two lesbian stories ever.  I think the second one made up for the first one.  The second one was good.  I don't even remember the first one anymore.  Yeah, the second one was good.  Yeah, the second one, the girl was definitely much hotter, but she could have done a little  better, too, but a hundred times better than her. 
[00:43:30]  I think she sounded like all a little drunk herself right there when she was telling the  story.  No, I think she did a great job, especially this being regular radio in the year 2007.  Yeah.  She hit a home run for everybody.  Definitely an upgrade in the second part of the story, so thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  With that, we take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says, Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Ready?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, and we greatly appreciate that.  Lots going on.  We've got the Paltalk cameras in studio, and it's Whip them out Wednesday, so the girls  give us a nice, nice treat on Wednesdays.  Got a little shower show.  Little shower show's going on.  Girls are wowing on the Paltalk cameras.  They're wowing on the streets, in their cars. 
[00:44:30]  Wow is really, really easy.  If you're a fan of this show, get a wow sticker or get a homemade wow sign.  It does two things.  It supports the Opie and Anthony Show and also gives you a chance to see boobies.  Real live boobies.  Boobies.  When you're driving to work or driving around town or driving your kids to soccer practice.  Yeah.  That's what you want to see.  Wow stands for Whip them out Wednesday.  Pretty much it's Whip them out whenever, but we like to celebrate the fact on Wednesdays. 
[00:45:00]  So get a wow sticker or homemade wow sign on your car so you can play.  You've got to be in it to win it, man.  Then you just drive around.  Yeah.  Don't do anything else.  And then before you know it, why is that girl flashing me?  What the?  Oh, that's right.  I have a wow sticker on my car.  And definitely plenty of girls out there that will flash to see the wow sticker on your car.  The truckers know.  Oh, boy, do they know.  Oh, yeah.  So we've got the shower going on on the Pal Talk cameras. 
[00:45:30]  We looked out our window here in New York City, and it looks like Fatty's on her exercise bike.  Yeah.  Good old Fatty.  She's doing her morning ritual.  Yeah, Jimmy has an observation.  She's on that bike every day, but nothing's happening to her body.  She's just awesome.  I said at the break, what does this slob do?  Like work out and then go eat cake batter for breakfast?  She really should be shot.  Cake.  Harpooned.  And then she stands on her head.  Fatty with no razor.  It's a show every freaking morning for us.  With this girl.  Bike, stand on her head, get naked, walk around her apartment, take a shower, come back out 
[00:46:00]  naked, and then get dressed in her closet.  She likes to brush her teeth naked.  Yeah.  Naked, naked, naked, naked.  She's naked.  Naked.  Yep.  But she's a mess.  That's why you don't hear the excitement in our voices, really.  No.  It's more like, I don't know, it's more we're looking because it's there.  It's a novelty.  She's kind of there, and she's naked.  So what are you going to do?  Not look?  And she has shades and curtains and all that, but...  She fails to use them. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, she keeps them wide open.  Hey, let's say hi to H-Cup Jane.  Hi, guys.  From Jersey.  What's up, H-Cup Jane?  How you doing?  I have a bone to pick with you guys.  You were just talking about trampolining.  Yeah.  And someone who trampolines with a bigger chest doesn't have as much options as someone without, and I think we have much more options.  Why?  What are you talking about?  You said before that...  Anthony, I think it was you. 
[00:47:00]  You said that a girl with a smaller chest can do more things sexually than a...  No, no, no.  No, I didn't.  Hope said that.  Hope he said that, but he didn't mean like that.  I got a theory about small-chested women, that's all.  Oh, okay.  I think flat-chested women especially give up and do a lot more crazy things to make up for the fact that they got small boobs.  For the humiliating boyish figure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm still doing the same crazy things I was when I was small-chested. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So just tell everyone you're a slut.  That's fine.  Actually, I'm going...  H-Cup Jane wants everyone to know that she's a slut.  That's all.  Yeah, okay.  You get biggins.  But listen, I'm going to go out this afternoon and wow because I've been wowing in the morning and nobody's called in to say they've seen me.  So I'm going to try it in the afternoon.  I'm going to switch up today.  That's a good sign.  H-Cup.  Yes.  We don't take everyone's phone call.  That's true.  These phones ring the entire time we're here.  But you know what? 
[00:48:00]  And some mornings we don't even take one phone call.  But I am getting a lot of emails.  So some people, I guess they're just too shy to call in.  No, it's just we hate these calls.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Yeah, I was just on 95 South and I just got wowed.  Oh, yeah?  What happened?  Well, she pulled up and I looked over and she was wowing me.  All right.  Thanks. 
[00:48:30]  No problem.  We used to take a lot of wow calls back in the day because we just didn't have anything  else to talk about.  We're finally to the point in our careers that we have a lot of things we want to get to on  a daily basis.  Yeah, that we want to talk about.  That's actually a good point.  So we don't want to take the boring wow calls anymore.  We just know at this point it's happening on a regular basis.  And from time to time, we will take a phone call from someone that is wowing or getting  wowed.  Uh-oh.  You got competition, H-Cup Jane.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  We're going to put you on the phone with H-Cup Jen from Hempstead. 
[00:49:00]  Cool.  What's up, Jen?  What's up, Ope?  It's J-Cup Jen from...  Hey, J-Cup.  J-Cup.  J-Cup.  J-Cup a little better than H-Cup.  How do they get so big?  And the 36 J.  Honey, I grew them like this.  Yeah?  What do you want me to tell you?  This is what I ended up with.  Wait.  H-Cup.  J-Cup.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me control this a little bit.  H-Cup has fake H's. 
[00:49:30]  J-Cup Jen has a natural 36 J's.  36.  See?  That means she's not a big...  Do you tuck those in your socks?  I can't hear you, girl.  What?  How does someone with H-Cups make fun of someone with J-Cups?  J-Cups.  Saying they're too big.  Well, because...  I'm saying.  And I didn't pump them up.  I didn't have them paid for.  I grew them.  All right.  I guess what H-Cup is saying to J-Cup...  J-Cup thinks, J-Cup, that they might be a little saggy because you didn't buy them. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Oh, well, they're not hanging up over my shoulders like yours are probably, but they're not hanging  down to my waist either.  They're not.  You know what, baby?  Maybe we...  They look good because, honey, at 36, J, that's natural.  When you're in shape, does not sag like that.  Maybe we should trampoline together.  Oh, maybe we can't.  Jesus.  Hey, J-Cup, how do we get to see your Js?  I don't know.  I don't have PalTalk.  You don't have PalTalk?  You don't have MySpace?  Because I think...  I have MySpace, but they're not up on there. 
[00:50:30]  I don't do...  I don't kind of run like that.  Well, they've got to be there under a shirt or something.  Yeah.  So we can kind of...  They have to be what?  They've got to be there under your shirt or under the skies.  Yeah.  Under your jeans.  Come on, J-Cup.  Send in a pic.  H-Cup has pictures of her Hs, right?  Yeah.  And go on RateMyWow.  That's even better.  Yeah, RateMyWow.com is another fine website that Steve runs.  All right.  So you know what?  Maybe I'll put them up on there, and then you guys can see them. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  So we've got H-Cup J.  We've got J-Cup Jen.  J-Cup, do you wow out there?  I have wowed.  See, I told you guys.  You've got to get the wow stickers.  Absolutely.  I love the show.  I've been listening to you all since you won any W.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Love the show.  You big boob freak.  We love it.  We're going to turn this into...  Let's turn this into big boob day on the O.K. and Anthony show.  So far, we've got an H and we've got a J.  Yeah.  We're going to get into double letters.  And we have E-Rock, who's a big boob. 
[00:51:30]  And they're both wowing out there.  All right, listen.  Absolutely wowing.  H-Cup, I'm on ratemywow.com.  Which one is yours?  I have the red hat on.  How am I going to find a picture?  Because if you go to the new, I'm like the third row down.  All right, new.  Red hat.  I don't think you're in the third row anymore.  Fourth row?  I don't know.  I know a few girls have signed on since I went on.  Oh, okay.  There you are with your silly red hat. 
[00:52:00]  My silly red hat.  It's kind of a silly hat there.  And my boobies.  That's a fine boob job, though.  Oh, love that stupid thing.  Oh, are you of age?  Click here.  Oh, they got me.  Oh, good.  I know.  Jesus.  All right, you can see H-Cup Jane on...  Where is she most?  RateMyWow.com.  Very nice.  Highest rated, random, new.  Which one?  Which category is she in?  Go to new.  Go to new.  And then look for the red hat.  Yeah, it's like three or four down. 
[00:52:30]  Three or four rows down.  Yeah, that's why I wore the red hat.  Right there?  Yeah, that's her?  Yeah.  Let me see.  That's really, really not bad.  Holy mackerel.  That's really not bad at all.  That's a very good boob job.  You got a good doctor, I guess.  Thank you.  I flew to Kansas City to get these babies.  What?  What, were they full of helium?  Who the hell would fly to Kansas City for a boob job?  Kansas City.  Why would I do that?  Usually you hear Florida, even New York.  LA. 
[00:53:00]  For the right doctor.  Some guy grabbing a scalpel and going, yeah!  Kansas City.  How did you know the right doctor was in Kansas City?  I did my research.  If he was the right doctor, he would move to maybe Florida.  Yeah.  How do you know that?  Because there's a lot more girls getting boob jobs in places like Florida and California.  You don't hear about the best kept secrets.  You know, I'm looking at that.  I'm looking at your hand, which is placed on the side.  Yeah.  And yours are as big as a, that could be a bowling ball. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  That could be a bowling ball in her hand.  Well, maybe when I come up to visit someday, I'll compare it to Jimmy's head.  Well, Jimmy's, it does look like Jimmy's head.  It does.  How about we get you in studio?  Looks like he's been hit with a golf ball right on the center of the top of his head.  And it's one of those cartoon bumps are raising up.  Yeah.  How about you bounce him off Jimmy's head?  When can you do this?  Today?  Tomorrow?  Next week?  How about next Wednesday?  Next Wednesday, H-Cup Jane in studio. 
[00:54:00]  Set it up.  Set it up.  Confirm it.  Let's do it.  What about J-Cup?  You want to come in?  Why not?  Can we have a...  Why not?  How about we have a big booby day next Wednesday?  Who else wants in?  Wow day.  Big booby day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  We got H-Cup Jane and J-Cup Jen coming in.  That works for me.  Someone's saying that J-Cup sounds black.  I am black.  Oh, you are black there?  I am black.  Wow.  Okay, good call.  I wouldn't have caught that.  Black woman that likes the Opie and Anthony show.  I just...  Love the Opie and Anthony show.  I just knew because you were from Hempstead. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I was sort of thinking that too.  Hempstead, yo.  Hempstead, what's up?  I took the back roads home from the Coliseum one night.  Oh, don't do that.  Because I love my Islanders and for some reason the traffic was awful and I'm like, you know  what, how bad could it be if I just take a right here instead of wait on line with everybody  else to get back on the highway?  You know what's ironic?  The only place I go to in Hempstead is Coliseum Guns.  It's my gun store.  Yeah.  That's your gun store?  I don't even know.  That's where I go. 
[00:55:00]  Dude, you take the back roads from the Coliseum, you can't go a mile without seeing at least,  and Jen will back me up, at least 10 chicken franchise stores of all different names, names  you've never heard of before.  Kennedy fried chicken, Kentucky.  Kennedy fried chicken.  It's awful.  I don't go back there, Opie.  I can't believe you went back there.  All right.  And it's trying to pick its skull up.  Wait, name the chicken joints again, because we all know the...  You know there's Kentucky, but then there's Crown. 
[00:55:30]  There's Kennedy.  Yeah.  There's anything that sounds anything close to Kentucky, there's a name for it and it's  in Hempstead.  Is Churches out there?  I'm sorry, hon?  Churches.  Oh, that's that...  No, there's no Kurtz's.  I don't know what that is.  Churches.  Churches fried chicken.  Churches fried chicken.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't be surprised.  All right.  We're on to something, man.  We're getting the gay out of the show.  We got H-Cup Jane.  She's coming in tomorrow.  And you know what?  It would be easy to trash her, but...  No, not tomorrow.  Next Wednesday.  I mean, next Wednesday.  I'm sorry.  Next Wednesday.  It would be easy to trash her, but we just saw her picture on RateMyWild.com and she's 
[00:56:00]  all right.  Large breasts.  They're large, but they look kind of proportional.  They did a good job, like with the placement.  They're not as big as you think.  They're big, but they're not as big as you think.  All right.  And Jacob, you're coming in too?  Yep.  All right.  Let's try to get all the...  We should get the whole alphabet.  That would be hilarious.  Get all the letters in there.  How high does it go?  That would be good.  That sounds like a plan.  Actually, you can go pretty high.  But how high does it go?  Is there like a...  There's no limit. 
[00:56:30]  There's no...  There is no limit.  There's no Z cup.  I'm going to bring you a picture of one of my friends.  You'll see what I'm talking about with no limit.  There is no limit.  I have an H cup friend.  I have an I cup friend.  And I'm the J cup of the three of them.  There's an I cup?  Yeah, I have a friend who's...  Is that like the iPhone?  I got that B cup.  You can check your email with it.  I hope that doesn't mean there's a problem with one of them.  It looks like it's winking.  But Jimmy, you got to get right back on that trampoline. 
[00:57:00]  I would like to.  Maybe I will later.  Maybe I'll let go.  You know when you fall off, you got to get back on.  You think?  Yeah, I didn't fall off.  I just collapsed in a pile of mush and mashed potatoes.  Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you.  Love you guys.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you for that.  All right, ladies.  Thank you so much.  Have them maybe hold on and we can get their info.  We're going to have a big booby day on the Opie and Anthony show next Wednesday.  That way this doesn't fall apart.  That works for me.  This will fall apart like everything else we try, but we'll give it a shot.  Hold on the line. 
[00:57:30]  We got H cup and we got J cup definitely coming in.  And they are out there wowing.  So get your wow stickers on your cars and trucks or get your wow signs.  Because some of the radio stations are just lazy and they don't have wow stickers.  Who doesn't have wow stickers?  A bunch of the stations don't have wow stickers.  Back in the day when we started this, that didn't stop us.  Because the station we started this on didn't support wow.  So everyone just started making their own signs.  They were scared.  They were so scared that they wouldn't put out a wow sticker.  So we're like, you know what?  Our listeners are aggressive enough.  They'll start making their own signs. 
[00:58:00]  And boy, did they.  What station?  Can we name a station that doesn't have wow stickers?  I don't get it.  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah, just get the damn things, would you?  It supports the show.  There are women that have wow stickers that have no intention of wowing.  They just want to support the show.  And the one thing, we've said it for years, guys, there's plenty of women out there like  the two we just talked to that will wow if they see your wow sticker.  But don't harass any of the women.  No, you just wait for one that's ready, willing, and able. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, our listeners have been very, very cool as far as that goes over the years.  All right, we've got a quick story.  Boardroom Jimmy on the way, by the way.  We've got to talk about the stock market.  Oh, thank God, because I don't know what to do now.  I really don't know if we should be buying today, selling.  Does the panic continue today?  I don't want to make a move until I hear from Boardroom Jimmy because I don't know what  to do.  I don't know what to do with my assets.  Right.  We've got a quick story before we go to break.  Good old Al Gore. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're saying in the paper today that he looks like Orson Welles.  I was trying to figure out who he looked like during the Oscars.  He's a bloated old woman.  He looks like.  Al Gore does?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, there's some controversy with him.  Listen to this.  It appears Al Gore may have an inconvenient truth of his own lurking in his mailbox.  A conservative group says Al Gore has a $1,200 electric bill for his home every single month.  The Tennessee Center for Policy Research says Gore uses more electricity every month 
[00:59:30]  at his estate than the average American household uses in an entire year.  But Gore's people say the former vice president buys enough of his energy from renewable resources  like solar and wind power to balance his electricity costs.  Solar and wind power?  What is he got?  Windmills in his yard?  Just stop.  How great is that?  You got a huge mansion, and it takes a lot to heat it, and you got a lot of lights on, 
[01:00:00]  and it's a lot of money.  Another phony, like Barbara Streisand, she actually leaves the A.C. on all the time because  it has to be so cold.  Yeah.  To protect her voice.  And they said that, well, one of her spokespeople said, well, Barbara didn't actually say that  all these things apply to her.  It was the most arrogant thing you've ever heard.  So, like Al Gore is saying, it applies to everybody.  Hey, we got to cut down on these use of energy.  It's the only way we're going to cut down on this global warming.  And meanwhile, he has this huge house that's just, like, blasting out, using a crap load 
[01:00:30]  of energy.  It's the old, do what I say, not what I do.  Yeah.  If he was, you know, he should be like that stupid, what's his name?  God, who's that idiot that rides the bicycle everywhere?  Oh, um, uh, the actor?  Yeah, yeah.  Damn it.  Matt Armstrong?  No.  Mabel King?  Strawberry blonde.  Ed Begley Jr.  Ed Begley.  Ew.  Ed Begley Jr.  E-rock.  E-rock.  Wait, Ed Begley rides a bicycle? 
[01:01:00]  Ed Begley Jr. rides a bicycle.  He has, like, an electric car thing.  Like, he is Mr. Conservation, and his house is all, like, solar, but that's what Al Gore  should be doing.  Al Gore should say, look, I could preach this whole global warming thing and how disastrous  it is and how we all gotta work to solve the problem, or I can live in this huge house  that just sucks up energy like a tank. 
[01:01:30]  If you're gonna be out there preaching like he has been in the last year or two, shouldn't  you, shouldn't you live in, like, a grass hut?  Yeah.  At this point.  Exactly.  It should be, you know, a green, they call it a green house, not like the glass house,  but it works on solar power and, and you can't have, first of all, they say a lot of his  energy is a renewable thing like, uh, wind and solar.  You can't have a house that big that runs like that.  It just doesn't, it, we don't have that technology.  It doesn't work.  He spent 30 grand in combined electricity and natural gas bills in 2006. 
[01:02:00]  $30,000.  $30,000.  I love hypocrites.  And he wings all over the place.  They're my favorite people in the world.  And he wings all over the place in that jet.  You know, when he's doing his little talk, how do you think he gets there?  What do you think, he's swimming across the Atlantic?  Guy's burning all kinds of fuel.  He's not flying commercial.  Does he wing over to London?  To jet with the stones.  Me and Mick.  I hope Ed Begley Jr. is, I hope, I don't want him to be killed because that's mean. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  But I hope that a gas truck hits him on his bike and he loses both legs.  Just below the knee though.  How ironic would that be?  It would just be silly.  A gas truck.  For gas?  Yeah.  There you go.  That's terrific news.  There's another hypocrite in the news today.  It's quick, but it's on the same lines.  Yeah.  Uh, Madonna.  There's a little article about how she's not happy with her little daughter, Lourdes. 
[01:03:00]  What?  Because she's wearing very, very tight jeans to the point like she can't bend her knees.  Oops.  She's going through this thing with her clothes now because she's starting, she's actually  starting to get up there.  How old is she?  She's a young teen.  Is she a young teen now?  Yeah.  Or a preteen?  Getting close to a teenager?  I think she's probably a young teen.  I would put her at about 13, maybe 12.  I don't know.  It's pretty funny coming from Madonna who did all the, you know, we don't have to do  the laundry list.  Oh, yeah.  But you can just say the sex book.  Yeah.  But she's telling her daughter that she shouldn't be wearing tight jeans and all that. 
[01:03:30]  I'm sure she did the same thing when she was that age.  Yeah.  And she's saying, you know, do what I say, not what I do.  Yeah.  That old gag.  I think if you're the kid, you just let go, mom, shut up.  No, I'm going to do what you do.  You're the biggest slut in the 80s and most of the 90s.  Shut up.  I got to outshine your sluttiness.  Or do you think I'm partly brown?  That's how much of a slut you were.  You wanted to taste the...  It's normal for kids that age to dress saucy. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, Uncle Paul?  Saucy?  Saucy.  Yeah.  Put on your jeans.  You can't bend your knees.  Oh, creep.  God, I just want to choke you.  No, you got to eat.  What you do is you give a tummy a little kiss.  Oh, piggy boy loves you.  Daughter's 11, you sick Fs.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:04:30]  Thank you, Thad.  Who knows?  Pre-teen.  Do you think I keep tabs on that?  Pre-teen.  Yeah.  All right.  A lot of people saying the girls aren't going to show up next week.  See, they just know the Opie and Anthony show.  No, we have to make that happen just so we can prove.  For once, can we have something work out in our favor?  We want to have Big Booby Day next Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Big Booby Day.  Did we get their info?  H-Cup Jane and J-Cup Jen coming in next Wednesday.  Hopefully other women after the break will call in with their sizes, 
[01:05:00]  and we'll see if they make the cut for Big Booby Day.  Oh.  All right.  Boardroom Jimmy on the way.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wild.  To get your official Opie and Anthony wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony virus.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:05:30]  The O and A virus spreading across America on this fine Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Phone number.  Write it down.  You're going to need it.  1-866-313-FREE.  Looking for more girls to call about their big boobies.  Going to have them come in, I guess, next week.  Yeah.  We'll give it a whirl.  Yeah.  We'll try to sex up the joint.  We'll get all excited.  We'll be looking forward to it, and then we'll be staring at each other next week.  What happened?  What happened? 
[01:06:00]  Where are the girls?  They suck.  And then they'll call with their dumb excuses.  We've heard every dumb excuse.  Or one will show up with her boyfriend, and he'll be an Uber fan, and it'll just suck.  She won't take her shirt off.  Yeah.  They're stupid excuses.  Hi, I can't come in.  Oh, what is it?  Breast cancer.  Oh.  That's a stupid explanation.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Maybe that would be legit.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  It depends how early.  I'm just going to bail on any remarks. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  I like when Jimmy just leaves the aircraft.  Yeah, yeah.  He just leaves.  You know, you could have said something about mailing something in, but I figured why?  Oh, my God.  So, yeah.  Just in life, why would you?  You wouldn't.  You wouldn't say that as a decent human being.  I wouldn't even think of it.  Good boy.  We got H. Cup Jane and J. Cup Jen so far.  Any other ladies want to call up with their cup size?  It's got to be a biggie, though.  It's got to be a biggie.  Does it have to be big, or can we just, like, get every size and try to spell things with  them? 
[01:07:00]  Like, A, you know?  C is easy.  We'll spell dirty words.  C is the most popular letter, I think.  It's going to be hard to find a U.  No.  All right.  Well, the big news today, of course, the stock market.  Wow.  The big crash yesterday.  I got a little scared.  Why?  They went special report on us yesterday.  Did they?  A little special report, and then it was about the stock market.  I'm like, oh, all right.  With all the crap going on in the world these days?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  I was like, oh, all right.  I can handle this special report.  This is an easy one.  Yeah, it was, I guess, China had a little problem early on, and their market crashed,  and then ours, for some reason, has to crash, because theirs did.  They're like, oh, what?  China went down?  Well, then we got to.  Yeah.  And it went down, like, over 500 points, and then they came back a little bit at the  end and closed out at four and change, but it was the biggest drop in five years since  9-11.  That's a good sign. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, oh, boardroom, Jimmy.  Well, thank God.  The bigger the plunge, the better it is for investors.  Really?  Yes.  The Asian market crashed because of the giant condom overload that nobody's using.  What?  I never knew.  Yes.  Buy sugars.  Sugars and cubic zirconia.  That's the way for this whole thing to turn around.  I specifically said, stop with those cow noises.  I don't know what they mean.  That's a bull.  That's a bull.  You should know that.  That means you're feeling bullish. 
[01:08:30]  You're bullish on the market.  Yeah.  Stupid dinks have done it again.  But where's the bear?  Because that's the bad one, that we need a growl.  The market's dog-ish?  Well, it is.  Sell short, gentlemen.  Sell short.  Sell short.  Sell short.  Wait a minute.  How do you...  Is that possible?  Sell short in this market.  Is it good after a crash like this to sell short?  Well, there's going to be a penalty bid.  But if you sell short, things are sure to turn around sooner or later. 
[01:09:00]  The Dow Jones, it was up yesterday a little bit.  No, no, no.  Boredom Jimmy, it was way down.  Not to compare with 1927, it wasn't.  It was up.  Oh, you're looking at the big picture.  Yes, you have to look over a hundred-year span.  Now, I've got to ask you, and this shows a little volatility here in the market.  Where should we be looking today?  When that market opens, what do you suggest we do?  Get tangible fish assets and then do what you're supposed to be doing with them, 
[01:09:30]  but don't allow the crash to deter you from purchasing sugar.  Sugar?  Sugar and tangible fish assets?  Sugar and, no, fish oils.  Fish oils are the future.  Fish oils.  Okay.  You heard it here, people.  Sugar and fish oils are what you should be looking into buying.  Yes, it was a stock market correction.  That was happening yesterday.  The stock market needed to be corrected so it plunges a little bit in a three-minute span,  but that's a sign of healthy growth. 
[01:10:00]  Three minutes?  Healthy growth?  Healthy growth.  Sometimes you need to lose $600 billion to make $40.  I've specifically said that.  Now, boardroom Jimmy, the market's going to open.  Do you see a sustained gain throughout the day,  or is this crash going to continue and bring us further into the hole by the time the market closes?  You raise an interesting point, and I think that I can agree with it.  No. 
[01:10:30]  That wasn't a point.  It was a question.  Excellent point.  That there was something that happened yesterday, and yet it could go on their eyes a little bit later.  But it all depends on what's happening overseas with the Japs.  The Japs.  Yes.  It was the Chinese.  Oh, it was the Koreans.  Whatever it was.  Their eyes weren't round.  Thanks for nothing.  Now, knowing that, on the whole, the market will recover from this, should I be thinking about maybe buying some options?  Some options, some call options, perhaps. 
[01:11:00]  Get a couple of puts.  I've told you many times when the market crashes that you should take all of your money and put it into the market.  That's the best time to get in.  That's the definition of a put.  Of a put is when you put the money in the market.  Yes, put it down, and then walk away and let it grow for you.  So, how much do you think I should put in the market?  $75 to start.  You don't want to get too crazy.  I mean, kick back on Easy Street and enjoy a stogie. 
[01:11:30]  Industrial production is the future.  Industrial production.  Okay.  All right, okay, that's good, tangible testimony you're giving here.  Of course it's good, tangible testimony.  Invest today.  The market's in good shape.  Well, not after yesterday.  Yesterday was a good day.  It fell a little bit, but that's to be expected on a Tuesday.  It was a record five-year loss.  I know, but I predicted that that would happen five years ago.  It's on the front page of every paper in America, though. 
[01:12:00]  This is good news for retirees.  It's good news for retirees.  How is that?  Because your money is jumping around actively.  But you want it to go up.  This is probably going to hurt a lot of people's accounts and portfolios.  No, your portfolio should be divested.  And what better way to have it divested than just to have it laying in ruins on the ground?  Are you saying it's best to just start over sometimes?  Sometimes you have to just start right over. 
[01:12:30]  You throw up the baby in the bathwater, and you start fresh.  You cash in a bond for $100, and you start small.  $100, and then maybe buy some sugar or fish oil.  Yes, get $100 and get yourself a hedge fund manager.  And tell them, make my money work for me.  A hedge fund manager.  $100 and a hedge fund manager.  And you'll be enjoying the good life.  Well, I really want to know about, is this going to continue, or should we look into bonds, maybe? 
[01:13:00]  Maybe we should go into...  Bonds are for faggots.  Nobody likes bonds.  Bonds are no good.  All right.  I think that's going to be a quote in the financial section tomorrow.  Wall Street.  I think it's going to be on the front page of Wall Street Journal.  It says, bonds are for faggots.  And this was good news for investors.  It was?  Yes, it was.  Do you see maybe this as a buying opportunity?  It depends.  On?  Yes, of course.  Yes, of course.  It depends on what you want to buy. 
[01:13:30]  Ah, he's very patriotic.  He's very up on this.  I see that.  He's got a suit on the market.  And his top hat on.  He's not worried at all.  No, you look like the Monopoly dude.  I feel very confident that today's market is going to be a bear market thing, but without the typical feelings of a bullshare.  A bullshare.  Exactly.  So you're saying this is a bull market.  Now, I know some indicators come out today.  Some economic indicators are going to be coming out today that could affect the market, such as whether we're going to be seeing inflation. 
[01:14:00]  What are your – or maybe the R word.  They've been talking about the R word.  What about the R word, Jimmy?  What do you think about the R word?  Well, there are three R's.  Read and write and arithmetic.  And without them, we have nothing, do we gentlemen?  I think a recession is good for the economy.  Why would that be good for the economy?  Because a lot of different things can happen with your bonds.  Get a put, enjoy your recession, and live on easy street. 
[01:14:30]  He likes easy street.  Of course I do.  Who doesn't want to live there?  $30 and a hedge fund manager.  That's all you need to make it.  Some people are saying Alan Greenspan had something to do.  He's a Jew.  He is.  Yes, he is.  They said he might have had something to do with the big fall yesterday.  Interest rates are going up.  This is the best time to buy a home.  Higher interest rates are good.  It means that you're paying interest instead of those annoying principal payments that I hate so much. 
[01:15:00]  I think you're confused that it's the other way.  No, I'm not confused.  Give me a no-load fund.  Oh, you want a no-load fund?  Absolutely.  Invest in trampolines, gentlemen.  Trampolines?  Yes, and amortize your interest.  Ah, okay.  Anything in the, because the NASDAQ also took a hit yesterday.  The NASDAQ is doing fine.  It's the Dow Jones and the Nikkei that we're doing mediocre. 
[01:15:30]  The Nikkei?  Yes!  And we're blaming the Chinese today, right?  Of course we are.  If you're there with the Filipinos or the Taiwanese and their child pornography.  Well, I didn't know that could affect the Dow there, Boardroom Jimmy.  I know that tech stocks are kind of just making a comeback.  No, they're not making a comeback.  They died terribly yesterday.  They're from faggots, too.  All right, you want to take a few phone calls?  I'd love to.  All right, let's go to Mike in Jersey.  You got a question for Boardroom Jimmy.  I can't hear what's a 1010 News ticker in the background. 
[01:16:00]  No, that ticker is very loud.  It's actually your ticker behind you.  It's the glass dome that Gomez Adams used to check his stocks on.  Go ahead, Mike.  I want to know if I should sell all my computer stocks.  Computers are a fad.  I told you.  Pencils.  Pencils and paper.  That's what you should be investing in.  Computers are falling by the wayside.  I don't use them.  So anything, Dell, Gateway, everything should just be sold. 
[01:16:30]  They're flopping horribly.  The Taurus is making a comeback.  That's what you should invest in.  The Taurus and things with Taurus on it like shirts.  You heard it here first.  Computers are a fad.  Pencils in.  Yes.  Pencils and paper.  Just look at the foreign exchange in the Wall Street Journal, as I've been doing,  and you'll see exactly as I mean.  Look over in Africa.  Invest in AIDS.  If you can get your foot on the ground floor of the AIDS movement,  you're going to make a lot of money.  Invest in AIDS.  Absolutely. 
[01:17:00]  Maybe if this was 1986.  Oh, no, AIDS is making a comeback.  Thanks to all those stupid school initiatives I've had squashed.  I don't know how you can invest in AIDS.  You certainly can.  How?  How do you invest in AIDS?  I have a shrinking shirt opportunity.  Buy shirts that you can make smaller and smaller,  and then you can fold them over into a suit jacket.  Oh.  And what about broth?  Should we be buying broth futures?  Yes, you should be buying broth futures and CD Holdings.  That's the way to go. 
[01:17:30]  CD Holdings and broth futures and AIDS.  All right.  Let's say hi to Wayne in Franklin Square.  You got a question for Boardroom Jimmy.  Hello, Boardroom Jimmy.  I have a question.  I want to invest in a pedophile...  Sir, this is not a legitimate question,  and I'm not going to entertain joke questions  when I'm doing serious business here.  Yeah, this is very serious today.  We're trying to figure out if the stock market is going to bounce back.  I do believe, what, a dead cat bounce there?  Yeah, yeah.  Give me a dead cat bounce.  There's no such thing as a dead cat bounce. 
[01:18:00]  Every time it falls, it's going to fall farther.  Yesterday, the Dow went up 40 points at the end of trading.  It was down like a total of five.  No, it wasn't.  The papers are wrong.  It was up.  At 3 o'clock, it says it right here, it's down 524.  The S&P 500.  Read about that for a little while.  Do you have anything to say about the S&P 500?  Yes, of course.  It shouldn't be 500 anymore.  If things were falling, it would be 400.  But it's really not a number that...  Of course it isn't. 
[01:18:30]  What?  But you said it is.  Yes.  What?  He's clearing everything up for me, though.  I feel a lot more confident going into the trading day.  We only have time for a few more questions for Boardroom Jimmy.  It's Tito in Atlanta.  Tito, what's up?  Hey, Boardroom Jimmy.  I want to let you know if this is going to go off for lozenges.  I need to hear you.  Lozenges.  I believe he wants to know your advice in investing in lozenges.  Tito?  I don't talk to a man named Tito about stock trades.  Why don't you buy yourself some bad water and some diarrhea? 
[01:19:00]  Well, he might have a few bucks from his landscaping job.  He certainly does.  Build a wall for less than minimum wage, Tito.  How do you feel about day trading, Boardroom Jimmy?  It's overrated and for queers.  Stay away from day trading.  There's no money to be made.  Do it at night when nobody else is around.  When you can't, the market's kind of closed.  Oh, yeah, but you can always email somebody and they'll do it for you in the morning.  Are you talking about inside trading?  Of course.  It's the only way to go.  Get information, buy the stocks, and tell no one. 
[01:19:30]  Well, it sounds like a winner.  It's a winning strategy to me.  Wow.  He's clearing up everything.  I cannot wait until the bell is rung at 930.  I'm going to dive right in now on your advice.  I can't wait either until this stupid character is finally dead.  Well, let's go to Paul.  Oh, Paul, Jimmy hates his characters.  Of course he does.  But I misuse his characters.  Yes, he does, and he's doing a two-share. 
[01:20:00]  Let's go to Paul.  What's up?  Hey, Boardroom Jimmy, I invested in fructose, and now I lost my life savings.  Yes, you're welcome.  I told you, fructose was the way to go.  Life savings have to be wiped out.  You start fresh.  See, now you did advise people to buy fructose last time around.  Yes, I also say trans fats.  Invest in trans fats.  They're making a comeback in Manhattan.  Now, come on, Jimmy.  I have heard that a lot of places are banning these trans fats.  But the ban is only temporary because trans fats are healthy. 
[01:20:30]  I've been doing research on this medical field.  Trans fats are good.  Invest in trans fats.  Trans fats.  And anything Asian.  The Asian market is going to be very strong today.  Fish oil.  Fish oil.  And Jews.  Invest in Jews.  And in bits that get run into the ground.  Invest in those.  I think you got something there.  Hey, fat kid on a trampoline on TV right now.  Ah, you got a lot of fat kid.  There you go.  Invest in fat kid on the trampoline.  Hey, your credibility is not doing too well today.  Another guy really pissed off at your boardroom, Jimmy. 
[01:21:00]  It's Matt in Maine.  What's up, Matt?  Yeah, I took his advice last week and put my $40 in and I lost my shirt.  Well, I told you, put $40 in, but be prepared to gamble a little, my friend.  How do you think it feels to be bombing in front of two of you?  No, I'm not happy.  I wouldn't say you're bombing, Jimmy.  I don't care.  I'm tired.  My throat hurts from this crap.  Why doesn't boardroom Jimmy talk like a different character?  I'm a zero trick pony. 
[01:21:30]  He's got to be so angry.  Well, he's angry.  There's a lot of tension today.  It does sound like Frank the Frowner got his foot stepped on.  Of course it does.  Frank the Frowner and six other characters.  Maybe it could be Uncle Paul boardroom Frank Jimmy.  And I guess that's it for boardroom Jimmy.  It certainly is.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, we got a lot of advice.  You're going to have to sort it out.  You got a little bit of time to sort it all out.  Remember, computers are a fad. 
[01:22:00]  Fad.  Pencils and paper.  Pencils and paper.  Sugar.  Fish oil.  Bonds are for faggots.  AIDS.  Invest in AIDS.  And watch the S&P 500 fall dramatically this afternoon.  S&P 500 is going to be S&P 400.  Just as you're wrapping up, I just keep going, don't I?  Yeah.  I keep trying to salvage something.  I should be trampolining with a fat girl.  And day trading you should do at night.  Right.  Okay.  When there's no one watching.  Or something like that. 
[01:22:30]  And inside trading is okay.  Yeah.  Just don't tell anybody.  Yeah.  You just can't tell anybody.  That's the key.  You can tell a lot of people about it after you do it.  I like to make them all eat crow at the SECC.  C.  C.  Well, that's not a commission.  There's plenty of C's there.  Might be just one C.  How's your throat there?  Well, mercifully for the listening audience, it's starting to bother me badly.  So I won't be able to do this one for a while. 
[01:23:00]  We might need you, though, boardroom.  You won't need me.  Believe me.  When the trends come out, then you'll realize how much you don't need me.  All right.  Well, I'm at ease.  I feel better now.  Certainly.  Yes.  I'm going to go with the pencil and paper.  I'm dropping all my Dell stock.  Uh-huh.  And I'm going with pencil and paper.  I don't even know the company.  I've got to do some research now.  I have very little time.  Heat Pencil Emporium.  Heat Pencil Emporium.  Heat Pencil Emporium in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 
[01:23:30]  Thank you.  It's going to go through the roof.  Thank you, because I was wondering what pencil company you would invest in.  Yes.  Pete Pencil Emporium.  Pete.  Yes.  P-E-T-E-S.  As in Pete, as in Moss.  Now, do they specialize?  Wow.  Wordplay humor always plays well.  Pun room Jimmy.  Do they specialize in the most popular, the number two pencil?  No.  The number two pencil is shit, and they know it. 
[01:24:00]  Wait a minute.  Geez.  Word room Jimmy.  When in doubt, go for the automatic dump.  Word room Jimmy, you're saying the number two is crap.  What do you say, Al?  Al got that one.  That was an easy one for Al.  I hope Al wasn't running to his broker to try to maybe make some deals before the market opens.  I hope he was at the button.  Listening to this bit, he should be going for his snooze on his alarm to try to catch five more minutes.  I hate myself.  What number of pencils should we invest in? 
[01:24:30]  Number seven.  Number two pencils are a passe.  Passé.  I've never heard of the number seven pencil.  That's three twos or a one.  Number seven.  Yes.  They're thick.  Nice thick.  A good quarter inch point to write with.  Like a retard pencil.  It certainly is, as it should be.  I really degenerated into nothing, haven't I?  Well, not really.  I can't wait to read Minnelli's memo on this.  Look.  Maybe we should all invest in ties that Ethel Merman would use as drapes in her living room. 
[01:25:00]  Well, he dresses a little strange, but...  Ten of eight.  I'll be here in eight minutes, John.  That's great.  Minnelli's wearing the Fred Mertz collection.  Well, there you go.  All you need.  Well, that's all the info you need.  Yeah.  Market opens at 930.  There you go.  A lot of advice for the listeners.  It's taken off.  The futures look good this morning.  I think we're going to have a start.  We're going to be up.  And then whatever happens, it's... 
[01:25:30]  And he blamed the Taiwanese, the Koreans, and the Jacks.  And a computer glitch.  And a computer glitch?  And computers in general.  Computers are a fan.  I've been saying that for years.  They're not going to last.  They don't help at all.  It's much faster just to add in your head.  But no one really uses the computer to add.  For math.  Right.  They do.  I remember when I was doing my taxes, I had to do $4,820 minus $3,752, and it was much  easier to do paper and pencil. 
[01:26:00]  I have a phone with a little calculator program on it.  I use that frequently.  Oh, you do?  I turn it upside down, and it says hell.  Plays little word games with his calculator.  How are we going to get our porn if computers are a fad?  Pornography is not going to last.  Pornography made $700 last year.  No one wants it anymore.  It's all about God and stem cells.  But, Jimmy, that's a...  So I guess we should be shorting pornography.  Yes!  Pornography is...  No one watches it anymore. 
[01:26:30]  It's not sexy.  Masturbation is out.  Okay.  Well, again, you've heard it here.  Oh, and we should buy trampolines.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, he's answered a lot of questions.  Yes.  I...  Like the question, should there be a writer on this show occasionally?  The answer is certainly yes.  Does show prep help?  The answer is I wouldn't know.  Just show up and look at a bunch of highlighted things and try to wing it, fat tits. 
[01:27:00]  What do you say, Al?  Yeah, Al got that one too.  Hello, exactly!  I wonder if Jimmy's losing his mind.  Who can blame him?  I mean, there's a lot of tension today.  It's a very volatile market.  Of course, he's all wound up.  Wall Street, yeah, yeah.  It's all wound up.  I'm all wound up.  I have the sexual prowess of a quadriplegic.  I'm sorry.  It's kind of difficult to think.  Yeah, that might have influenced your character today. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, apparently Wall Street, the Dow wasn't the only thing down yesterday.  It's like hitting somebody with a feather and saying, I just beat your brains out.  Polish joke book, 1975.  Invest.  You know, two Jews walked in one bar and they owned it.  How about an original thought?  He's disgusted with himself.  As he should be.  But he is the two jump chump today, so you can't blame him.  Zero trick pony, two jump chump.  I'm Jim Norton on opianthony.net. 
[01:28:00]  Even I hate me today.  All right.  I know what I want to fix you up then.  Yeah.  All your questions answered.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Anything?  No.  Nothing.  No.  Bill Burr for third mic.  What?  You know what?  It just goes to show you, too, how great I do in the market. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  I decided I was going to buy some options.  Remember when I bought options that day?  Live here on the air?  Yeah.  Oh, they're just worthless.  They're just worthless.  Oh, for the merger?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I figured out, you know.  The satellite radio merger.  They announced.  They thought it was a good opportunity.  No insider stuff going on.  I wait for, you know, announcements just like everybody else.  And I buy.  And, of course, everything's down.  I was a watcher yesterday just watching my stocks plummet. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Would you like a tip?  Oh, please.  Citadel.  Buy Citadel.  Oh, boy.  Thanks.  Got in on the ground floor of that one.  You had to drag us into the bad mood category.  Got in the IPO.  19 bucks a share.  Yeah, thanks.  I think it's back up to 10.  Yeah.  Faith on the rise.  You're welcome.  We've lost our shirts.  You're welcome.  You're well stocked there, Boardroom Jimmy.  Why do you think we have to work for Fareed again on his stupid radio stations?  Yeah.  We can't afford not to. 
[01:29:30]  Stupid radio stations.  That's why we're on his stations.  Thanks.  Thanks for the ground floor of that IPO.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, we got a hot stock tip back in the day.  Couldn't have got in on the Google IPO at like 92 bucks.  Oh, no.  I thought that it's up to 400 and something dollars.  And I know.  We get in on Citadel at 19 a share.  And I were lucky.  And then when it hit like 24.  Yeah.  Me and Oprah are like, nah, we're staying in for the long haul.  That's right.  How many years ago was that? 
[01:30:00]  That was before we got back on radio.  Oh, my God.  That stock is now at, I think, 10 something today.  Half of what we paid for it.  Yeah.  Nice.  Oh, and how many shares did you buy?  A couple hundred.  Oh, I only bought about 5,500 shares of the stock.  That's all.  I decided to see how my bank account, I thought it was a guarantee.  That's it.  It's a winner.  This horse is a winner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why we're on Farid's stupid radio stations. 
[01:30:30]  We're paying off a debt like Chinese brought over in a container.  We're working at a sushi place, a nail shop, and the Yankee Cranky Joint.  At this point, we're paying Farid to broadcast.  How did that happen?  How the hell did that happen?  And then he got mad that we didn't buy him something.  Oh, for the great tip he gave us.  Yeah.  The only person who could get us out of that deal is Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. 
[01:31:00]  We're slaves, I tell you.  We're enslaved.  We're enslaved.  To our crappy stock.  That's why we're on in Syracuse.  That's why we're on in Buffalo.  Right.  And Portland, Maine.  We owe a debt.  And Providence.  We owe a debt.  It's the only reason you're hearing our voices.  We stink.  Boardroom Jimmy rocks.  My armpits are wet with shame sweat.  I don't have shame sweat.  Dude, that was hilarious.  Eat your cantaloupe.  It'll make you feel better.  Yeah, let's step aside. 
[01:31:30]  We got...  Oh, oh, up next.  We're going to talk to you or what?  Yeah, sure.  We'll say hi to Brother Joe.  Brother Joe's back from Vegas.  Is this a new guy since the last time?  Yeah.  It's like second new guy since the last time.  This guy, though, walks down the street and just gets mobbed.  This guy looks exactly like Bono.  There could not be someone that looks more like Bono than this guy.  But I thought the last guy looked exactly like Bono.  But this guy looks exactly like...  But, like, I think Joe got Bono in here.  Yeah, something's going on. 
[01:32:00]  Joe finds the Bono look-alikes.  We're now...  2U is now a franchise, so I had to find more than one really, really good Bono.  You're franchising someone else's band?  I was reading...  That's like Joe's opening up McDougal's chain of burger joints.  McDougal's.  And it's just a cover band of McDonald's.  And he's franchising it out.  I was reading an article on tribute bands, and they're knocking all the cover bands out of the clubs. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the rock clubs, they don't want to deal with cover bands anymore.  They're going right to the tribute bands now.  It's all about tribute bands.  Start getting sick of hearing...  So you have more than one Bono now?  Uh, yeah, there are actually two working...  Two full bands working.  Two complete bands working.  Next, St. Paddy's Day, one is going to be in Hawaii.  The other one is going to be in Florida at the Hard Rock Seminole.  You're going to Hawaii, right?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, you're not stupid.  What, are you kidding me?  Nice.  You're not stupid.  Say hi to Mr. Hanalee for me. 
[01:33:00]  Don't pick up any tiki's.  It is taboo.  It is taboo.  Hey, that's really cool.  All right, we'll talk to the new Bono.  Yeah.  But you have the other Bono still.  There are a bunch of Bono.  Not that I don't like the new Bono.  A bunch of Bonos.  A whole bunch of Bonos.  It's like you're cloning Bono in a lab somewhere.  It's kind of creepy.  We ought to...  Wait, are you guys hanging out for a little while?  Yeah.  Because we ought to see what the reaction is on the street when he walks down the street  when we walk over.  Nice.  Because I bet people kind of... 
[01:33:30]  I bet you spin heads around.  People think you're Bono.  God, he looks just like him.  It's ridiculous.  He's got people surrounding him, walking with him.  Yeah, yeah.  The important part is he sounds just like him, too.  That's what you need.  Yeah.  Am I on?  Yeah, go ahead.  Brilliant.  Good morning, America.  How are you?  Wait, where are you from?  You're not from Jersey?  No, man.  I live in Chicago right now, but I'm moving to Los Angeles.  But I came here as a kid from Yugoslavia.  Yugoslavia?  By way of Dublin, Ireland.  His name is Pavel. 
[01:34:00]  Of course he came from Yugoslavia.  Pavel?  Yeah.  Pavel looks like Bono.  How did that work?  But you know, it's Paul in English, and that's Bono's real name, Paul Hewson.  Ooh.  Hey.  Why is he named Bono?  Well, Bono came from a hearing aid shop off of O'Connell Street called Bono Vox, when  Italian means good voice.  And so when he was growing up in Dublin, they all had little nicknames, and his buddy  Googie, they gave him that nickname, walked by, and they saw this place called Bono Vox, 
[01:34:30]  and they decided to keep it, good voice.  But after a while, they called them just Bono or Bono, depending on the pronunciation.  Now it's silly if you call him Bono.  You sound like, you know, it's one of those people.  Who we got here today on our show, today, Bono's coming in.  Bono from U2 will be in here today on Regis.  I was thinking more Larry King.  Larry King.  It's Bono from the U2.  Bono, do you like garlic? 
[01:35:00]  Shut up.  Now I want to hear what the new Bono sounds like.  I know.  Did you bring any?  I have the Vari-X system with me, and if you guys would allow me to plug it in, we can  do a song or two.  Really?  Sure.  Yeah, let's do a song.  Yeah, do it up.  If you think you could pull it off, let's do it next.  You got it.  And Moochie would like to say hello to America.  Moochie.  Moochie's actually from Belfast.  Moochie's a big fan.  He's from Belfast.  Moochie is a cameraman in Belfast.  How are you a big fan in Belfast?  Huge. 
[01:35:30]  Come on.  Internet?  He's a northerner.  Really fast, because we've got to take a break.  I'm a Rana Fez fan, so I listen to that show as well, of course, but I have the...  But how?  Through the Internet?  Internet, yeah.  Online?  Excellent online.  That Internet.  See, Boardroom Jimmy, I think the Internet and the computers have kind of taken off.  Just don't answer.  Just nod.  I like that, how you just nodded your head.  I prefer that, too.  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  All right, you guys plug in.  We'll see what they sound like.  We also got Big A and Twitchells coming back to do the news today.  And we've got to talk about, you know, beating Big A down. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  We'll play the audio one more time before we move on from that bit.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.

[01:38:00]  Yes.  And it's up on opiananthony.com.  So if you enjoy Boardroom Jimmy, you might want to check out the animation.  It's really, really good.  Who did that one?  That was good.  That guy, Coke Logic.  Coke Logic?  Was it Coke Logic again?  He's really good.  All right.  We got Big A and Twitchell standing by.  But Brother Joe's in studio today with one of the versions of his U2 tribute bands.  That mic should be on there, Joe. 
[01:38:30]  One of the franchise.  Hey, hey, hey.  A piece of the franchise.  Hey, A.  Yeah, he brought his guitar with him.  And his Bono.  I have like 1,000 guitars with me.  Does that work?  Just need the headphones on.  Yeah, this thing is a stupid system that I ended up picking up.  And it's got like a million sounds.  Joe just needs the cymbals between his kneecaps.  And he can just do it by himself.  Well, he needs a Bono. 
[01:39:00]  He's got a Bono.  We'll see how this works because they weren't even planning on playing.  But the guy.  What's your name again?  Pavel.  Pavel, right.  It's ridiculous how much he looks like Bono.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  And you were telling us the story that you get people thinking you're Bono all the time on the street.  Oh, no, every day.  You know, I travel quite a bit as an impersonator.  And, you know, especially at the airports.  I'm coming in sometimes same day, leaving the same day.  So I don't have much luggage or what have you.  I come in at the airports, you know, because Bono's constantly traveling. 
[01:39:30]  It's the whole giant assumption thing.  But that doesn't even matter.  I mean, my niece, this guy, this was like five years ago, wanted me to get a webcam.  16-year-old.  And I'm over at Fry's, you know, looking at webcams.  I'm thinking $30 to $250.  So, you know, I'm staring at these things.  I'm thinking, okay, $50.  I can see her like once a week or whatever.  And this guy just staring right at me, works there, said, hey, can I ask you, what do you think the best ones are here?  I don't really want to spend that much money. 
[01:40:00]  I'm just going to be talking to my niece and this and that.  And he says, man, he's looking at me, dropping his jaw, licking his lips, going, you know.  It's like, why is Bono worrying about how much a webcam costs?  Exactly.  But that's the whole willful suspension of disbelief, you know, and people just buy into that.  The question really is, is your niece still on the webcam?  Not anymore.  She's married now.  Hey, do you sign autographs when no one's looking like, ah, what the hell?  No, you know, I do sign. 
[01:40:30]  People are really insistent.  This is part of the problem.  I'm walking down.  People will say, hey, Bono, how you doing?  Right.  I'm just kind of giving the peace sign.  How you doing?  As I'm walking by, whatever, this and that.  They want to come up.  And he's gracious just as well.  And, you know, people want to take photos.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Take photos.  Sure.  You know, how often do you get to make people's day?  Right.  So take a photograph.  Give him a hug.  Say hi.  I actually think, you know, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I was in Dublin, Ireland  doing a gig out there and I was up at the Key Club, not the Key Club, over at the Temple 
[01:41:00]  Bar and a guy was playing guitar.  I just went up because I used to play guitar and sing at a club for years, just anything  and everything.  And the guy comes up and I turn around.  There's like 500 people outside.  I'm not kidding you.  Word spread.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding you.  Dude, Bono's playing.  And the funny thing is people are like, oh, my God, it's Bono, it's Bono.  And this girl comes up and goes, hey, do you know where Bono's restaurant is?  Right.  And I said, well, Bono doesn't have a restaurant, but his brother Norman did.  It's around the block.  Right. 
[01:41:30]  Because, you know, everyone knows quite a bit about the area.  And the guys are like, what the hell is that?  You know.  But I do sign stuff like, you know, love every day.  Jesus loves you.  Something, you know.  But I don't sign a name.  Don't do anything else.  Yeah.  And it's usually a scribble.  I kind of look at him saying, how about love every day?  And scribble something that's not even legible.  Yeah.  Don't even sign a name.  And they think, you know.  Yeah.  They're getting a Bono.  By the way, Joe said it.  I forgot if it was this Bono or another one that mentioned the fact, too, that you can't  really walk around on the street like holding a girl's hand because the real Bono gets 
[01:42:00]  in trouble.  That's true.  And it's not his wife.  Yeah.  They take a picture.  I got it.  I was in Boston two weeks ago with a friend of mine.  I went to the Museum of Art.  Next day on Jen and somebody, Zito and Jen, same thing.  All I'm going to do is Bono is cheating on his wife.  He's been at the Museum of Fine Arts there.  I'm like, no.  Dude, you got to walk around with a fatty.  Yeah.  Oh, that feels just a mess.  Or hold a guy's hand.  Here's my favorite stuff.  My favorite. 
[01:42:30]  I'm the hugest fan in the whole wide world.  I said, well, thanks so much.  I'm at the airport, right?  Pavel Spera is my name, right?  And, you know, people who are the hugest fans don't know his real name, don't know  his wife's name, don't know Diddley of anything, you know?  And I just think to myself, I don't really get it.  Do they wonder why Bono's flying coach when you're in 17D?  Right.  Can I reach over you?  Do I take it to Southwest regularly?  Hey, Joe, did you guys play the Nutty Irishman in Bayshore?  One of the versions of that? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, a while back.  You're getting rave reviews on that gig.  Really?  Yeah, I've seen many, many, many versions of 2U.  I've loved every version.  I can't wait to see the new one.  There are two new ones.  I hope you can see two different ones.  Yeah, Brother Joe is now franchising.  It's like Beatlemania for you, too.  We have a whole bunch of different bands together for it.  We're actually, on March 10th, we're going to be at the House of Blues, too, in Atlantic  City, doing the big room for the first time at the House of Blues. 
[01:43:30]  And you just got back from Vegas.  Yeah.  You were out there a month.  Yeah, we did a month out there.  That was good, too.  That was killer, actually.  Have they acknowledged you, man?  Do they know who you guys are?  They have to know by now.  Yeah, they definitely know.  There are two U2 tributes that they know about, and one of them is us.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Maybe three.  Yeah, well, they know who I am, stuff like that.  And my band in Southern California, when I was living out there, we played at Pierce Brosnan's  house.  He became a friend of his, and the Edge lived up the street.  And a friend of mine, Rich Cook, who's a photographer, and Bono called him up to do 
[01:44:00]  a bunch of photo shoots, because he and Brandon Flowers are best friends.  And Bono, he was saying, listen, why don't you take some photos of me and my buddy Pavel,  blah, blah.  And Bono's like, I'm really busy.  You know, I'd love to.  So, I love the guy.  You know, I'm not a weirdo, because I get it every day.  All right.  Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  We haven't even decided what we wanted to do.  Do you know Staring at the Sun or something like that?  No.  I haven't really rehearsed that with.  Let's do a popular one. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, let's do something.  I don't know any of you, too.  I don't know any.  It'd be funny if he said that.  I really don't do it.  I do Beatles, too.  How about one?  Let's do one.  One is great.  Wait a second.  Yeah, that's how it goes.  And by the way, Brother Joe's also working on his Ecstasy of Gold.  Oh, yeah.  That doesn't sound like it.  No, no.  Of course not.  I'm just playing around with my new system. 
[01:45:00]  Van Halen tribute to come.  Might as well, because they're not doing it.  And then really, in the step of a pedal, here we go.  We have a...  What are you feeding this guy?  This is a Variax system.  That's the same guitar.  Same exact guitar.  Push one button.  Pretty nice.  Do you have enough in the cans there?  I do.  Can I get some delay at all?  No?  That's fine.  Can I get some delay on that?  There, go ahead.  Testing.  One, two.  No.  No. 
[01:45:30]  That's all right.  I'm going to just go with what we have.  Oh, it might be Joe's mic.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  We're good.  We're good.  I'll just go with Joe's mic.  And we haven't really done much together here, but...  There you go.  A little reverb.  Give you a little bit.  Be a little forgiving.  And it is early.  You back off the reverb a little bit.  I'm on three hours of sleep here in New York.  And if you can, just a little more guitar.  I know there's a pain in the butt.  I got you pegged, so...  Is it getting better? 
[01:46:00]  Or do you feel the same?  Will it make it easier on you now?  You got someone to blame.  You say, one love, one life  When it's one need in the night 
[01:46:30]  One love we get to share  And leaves you, baby, some  Don't count forever  Did I disappoint you? 
[01:47:00]  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?  You act like you've never had love, baby  You want me to go without  Is it too late tonight  To drag the past out into the light?  Because we're warm  But we're not the same 
[01:47:30]  We've got to carry each other  Carry each other  Have you come here for forgiveness?  Have you come here for forgiveness?  Have you come to raise the dead?  Have you come here for forgiveness? 
[01:48:00]  Have you come here for forgiveness?  Jesus, to the lepers in your hand?  I ask too much  More than a lie  You give me nothing  I waste all I've got  We're warm  We're warm  But we're not the same  When we hurt each other  And we do it again  You say  Love is a temple 
[01:48:30]  Love the higher love  Love is a temple  Love the higher love  You ask me to enter  And then you make me crawl  I can't keep holding on  To what you've got  When all you've got is hurt  One love  One love  One life 
[01:49:00]  You've got to do what you should  One life  With each other  Sisters  Brothers  One life  But we're not the same  You've got to  Carry each other  Carry each other  One  One 
[01:49:30]  One  Oh  Baby  Baby  Baby  Baby  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  A little lowly, right?  Oh  Really?  God, they just kick it in  Thank you, America 
[01:50:00]  I hope you're forgiving  It's a little early for me  It's early for singing  Early for waking up  You know the great thing about New York?  It doesn't sleep  I thought Vegas didn't sleep  But New York is a great, great, great city  I stay here four days just for one gig  Doing a Maxim photo shoot  It's going to be out next month or so  But man, it's nice to hang out here  And the Guinness is amazing  What have they got you doing in Maxim?  Ah, just doing a photo shoot  Every month they do this little segment  With an impersonator  And they're doing some little stink  And something, I don't know 
[01:50:30]  Yeah  And the funny things  They're having  Because Bono's doing this  Humanituary work in Africa  What have you  And they have this scene  Where they're having Bono at the airport  With some tusks  Oh, jeez  Yeah, I'm sure he wouldn't want to  No, no, no  It's tasteful  It's tasteful  So I don't do any work  You know, to malign the man  I love him really to pieces  So, very cool  Listen, we've got to take another break  Brother Joe, the big plug  Is we've got Big A and Twitchels  Standing by  The big plug is  www.notu2.com

[01:58:30]  He's the guy  We throw stuff at  And he seems to be  A little confused  As to where he stands  So we had to reinforce  What his role is  On this show  He's not Big A  I don't know  I think he is kind of cool  Uh  No  Jimmy  You will have to be  Beat into the show  If you will  Well that's what  Jimmy's hoping for  Yeah of course he is  He's already  Pulling his pants down  Jimmy no  Stop  Uh we have time  To play uh  The Kunta Big A  Or him getting  Beat with sticks  Uh 
[01:59:00]  I like beating with sticks  Beating with sticks  Okay  So we had to beat  Big A down  First we whipped him  Yeah we wanted him  To uh  Say that he was Big A  Not Big A  So we kept saying  What's your name  Like Toby and Kunta Kinte  And he finally said  I'm Big A  I'm Big A  We couldn't take it  All rejected  But then we had  A few guys  With these bamboo sticks  That you know  Poe's got all those  Weapons around  Those bamboo weapons  And stuff  And uh  A wooden bastard sword  And uh  We had a few guys  Pick these things up 
[01:59:30]  And just beat the crap  Out of Big A  And the rules were  When he hit the ground  And went into the  Fetal position  Um  We got five seconds more  Usually it's like  When he falls  It's over  You gotta stop beating him  But we decided  Five seconds  After he falls  And that's when we stopped  And they wouldn't stop  They just kept beating him  And he's a trooper  Because we said  Try to last as long as you can  Before we get into  The fetal position  And you did great there  He fell pretty quick  He did  He lasted five seconds  Five seconds  He was on the ground  That's why they beat him longer 
[02:00:00]  It was like Private Pyle  With the soap  Here's a  Just in case you missed it  Alright here we go  Big A you say go  Go  Oh  Oh Jesus  Oh wow  And they're beating him  Oh he's down  He's down on the floor  Keep beating him  Keep beating him  Oh my god  Is he down  Oh god  They're beating the crap  Out of him  Holy  Oh god  Oh

[02:19:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:19:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol CM.  Opie, you know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm gay!  James Norton. 
[02:20:00]  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, we already started.  I've had my fill of palaver.  Oh, we've already started.  Got to thank John S. in Hartford.  A lot of people thinking that's Brother Joe's version of Ecstasy of Gold.  No.  No, that's John S. from Hartford.  He did the Alice in Chains song for us, if you might remember. 
[02:20:30]  He's a faithful listener to the program.  Actually, he hands in a bunch of stuff from time to time.  All his stuff is really, really good.  Yeah, we were talking about how the Metallica version of Ecstasy of Gold,  the theme from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, one of the songs,  how the Metallica version was really lackluster and a blue.  Just proven to the world that our listeners do a better version than Metallica.  Yeah.  That's John S. once again in Hartford.  We're going to play that every day for the next few days, 
[02:21:00]  until maybe we get another one in from our listeners.  And another one?  Why not?  Why not?  We'd like to see a little variety.  Maybe someone get really brave and do something very, very different with the song.  I'll be done with mine in about a week, week and a half.  All right, Brother Joe.  It's like American Idol of the stupid Ecstasy of Gold.  I saw Kirk Hammett just sounded lazy on their version.  Yeah, kind of.  It started out cool, and then he just went into a riff that had nothing to really do with the song.  And it just started thrashing.  Who cares?  Yeah, who cares? 
[02:21:30]  Metallica, self-absorbed?  Go on.  Just a tad.  Go on.  By the way, everyone liked the song except for Justin in New Hampshire.  Justin in New Hampshire.  When we played Metallica's version, it was half and half.  Half the people loved it.  Half of them hated it.  Rave reviews for John S. in Hartford, except for Justin.  Let's go to Justin in New Hampshire.  Justin.  What?  What?  Why don't you like it?  What happened?  I felt like I should be hitting people for two damage.  Fucking loot music. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, you thought it sounded like loot music?  I was wondering where he was going to go with the two damage thing, but he almost has a...  There is almost this renaissance-y sound to it.  I would like to hear that on the loot.  The loot.  Well, Justin, I got to tell you, I think you're the only one.  Between instant feedback, pal talk, and the phones, I think you're the only one that didn't like that.  Whatever, man.  I'm not punching out.  Wow.  He's pissed.  He showed me.  Someone's saying it sounds a little Mexican.  I don't know. 
[02:22:30]  I like it a lot.  I like it a lot.  What's wrong?  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Uh, Liddell, Chuck Liddell, my pal.  Yeah?  My comrade, my man of similar ilk, was in New York after he beat up Tito Ortiz again, and they said he was taping Conan, and they did this, the wise guy show on Sirius.  Oh, man.  Who is Chuck Liddell's?  Why would he not come into our show?  We had a great time with him.  I'm sure that wasn't his, I'm sure he didn't not want to, maybe we were off that day, I mean, I'm sure he didn't want to not do the show. 
[02:23:00]  A lot of these guys don't know any better, their people just kind of drag him around.  That's unfortunate, because we really had a good time with him.  We love Liddell.  Absolutely.  I had some fighting things I wanted to discuss.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jared in Utah.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, I thought that version was awesome.  Fuck that Justin guy.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  I think that was the best one so far, and we encouraged the listeners to send in their version.  But honestly, we're giving it a prime spot, so it's got to be really, really good. 
[02:23:30]  When we do these bits from time to time, we like playing the bad ones as well.  No, this one's got to be real good.  Yeah, this is one of those bits where you really got to impress us to get on the air,  because we're going to play John S.'s version for at least another, I don't know, week or so.  So there you go.  All right, Jared, thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  I don't think we need to take more calls.  Most of the people just love that version.  By the way, we just did the walkover from Free FM, and un-fucking-believable what went on. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  With the Bono look-alike.  Un-fucking-believable.  There was a waitress with maybe two of her, two teeth still in her head.  That freaked out and started shaking uncontrollably.  She was crying.  She was crying.  And then other people stopped walking and started following the little entourage we had.  Yeah.  People were staring.  People were beeping from their trucks.  Well, we had a crowd of people, because we usually do on the walkover, and camera, and, you know, Bono walking down the street. 
[02:24:30]  So everybody that looked at them, we were counting, and we were laughing, like, there's one, two, three, four, five.  Yeah.  And they all were just turning their heads, looking.  Couple of girls in a cab, when we were stopped waiting for the crosswalk to change.  When the bus went by, there was, like, eight people in the windows waving.  The driver beat, a cab, two girls in the back were looking, and you could just read their lips. 
[02:25:00]  You'd see them go, that's Bono.  Oh, my God.  And they're, like, smiling, and he's waving to people.  We want to get them on the street, outside, and see what kind of crowd we could get.  We have a Bono at our disposal.  Yeah, we want to just...  We've got to come up with something, you know, maybe go into a Starbucks with a camera and everything, and see how people react to it.  Does Bono smoke?  You smoke?  You do?  All right.  He does.  Oh, not you.  He does.  You don't?  I was thinking if we could start with a cigarette break outside the building and see how many people would come by just to watch Bono smoke. 
[02:25:30]  No, I smoke shisha and cigars occasionally.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's about it.  I think walking into a non-smoking establishment and, you know, saying, hey, screw you, Bono.  I do whatever I want all over the world.  Any suggestions?  What could you do right outside the building so we could get people just to start gathering?  I can sing really loud.  I can stand on top of a cab.  Stand on top of a cab. 
[02:26:00]  Stand on top of a cab.  That's my son!  That's Bruno Montelli!  This is Frank Rizzo.  I'm in New York.  I love it.  Dude, we can make believe we're filming some kind of, like, video with you.  That's the big thing.  I've noticed when I'm doing some video footage where there's a crowd around, it just piques people's interest and they kind of stand around for the curiosity.  How about we make believe that we're just getting a shot of Bono walking down the street in New York and we just do it over and over again and just see how many people would gather.  How many cameras do we have? 
[02:26:30]  We have Sam with his camera.  And then we get Master Poe because he's dressed apart to look like he's security, just standing by making sure nothing's going on.  Uh-huh.  Steve.  And maybe Steve can be the director.  Okay, let's do it again.  All right.  Let's start with that.  Yeah.  Sam, we're going to make believe you're just getting some B-roll of Bono walking down a city street.  And you want to get the people that are, like, you know, freaking out, too.  No laughing.  I want it very serious.  I want even someone out there yelling, like, look, please, please, we're trying to get this right. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, hey, yeah.  People are going, hey, hey.  Right, where's Danny?  You know how movie people are?  If Danny's down there with headphones and a mic, then people will think there's a sound guy.  They're all obnoxious.  You know, all the video people are obnoxious.  Hey, we're trying to, hey, we're filming a video here.  Move to the side of the sidewalk.  Like, just see how much you can get away with.  Put out that cigarette.  Like, do things like that, yeah.  Carrying something with a logo, turn that around, or we'll have to pixelate it.  And here's our goal.  Let's try to get this in the paper that Bono was cited doing a little video work on the sidewalk on 57th Street. 
[02:27:30]  So now we've got to get the paparazzi involved.  For the L.B. and Anthony show.  Don't even say.  Yes.  Well.  Yeah, then they're going to be like, oh, those fucking assholes again.  They couldn't possibly get Bono.  Fuck them.  They got us again.  All right, so you're the camera guy.  You're just going to walk up and down.  You're going to walk, like, dramatically.  Got it.  And Sam's going to go, all right, let's do it again.  And then you casually walk back up the sidewalk and do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Brilliant.  Danny will be the sound guy.  And Danny can also be, yeah, Danny being the sound guy can be the obnoxious guy that has to tell people what to do, like people that are passing by, and really get them. 
[02:28:00]  Like, hey, you're walking too close.  Yeah.  Don't you see what we're doing here?  Yeah.  Because he's good at being an asshole.  You bring cables.  I completely agree.  I think she's right.  A boombox would probably do the job.  A boombox with something blaring from it, you know, making him lip sync to it.  Yeah?  And make it look more like a video show.  Well, that might be tough to pull off.  Yeah, because people don't know how videos are made. 
[02:28:30]  They're dust.  It could just be walking.  It's just him walking dramatically.  He's right with cables.  Cable walking.  Cables.  Danny's dragging long cables.  They don't have to be plugged into anything.  Exactly.  Nobody will know.  All right.  Just dragging.  All right.  Very good.  What else?  We got cable.  We got a proper wireless.  We got a really long cable.  We got a professional-looking camera.  The still camera.  Where, like, maybe someone's taking some stills.  Yes.  Security is Stephen Poe.  And maybe we should have one more guy with sunglasses.  Not mine.  They can't wear mine.  Why don't we have some marks?  Like, we could make believe we have some fans right here that are already, like, taking pictures. 
[02:29:00]  Send E-Rock down with his camera.  Yeah, E-Rock with his camera.  He's just some douche going to work, and he stops and takes some pictures.  Maybe another.  We need two of those.  Yeah, we can get an intern to come down.  All right.  Get a Sharpie and stuff.  You could stop and sign something for one of our tools.  How about Pat Dummy?  We love you, opening Anthony.  Pat Duffy.  Oh, yeah.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Dummy.  Yeah, you can walk up and ask for an autograph.  Bonner can vomit in his face.  Got to be tasteful.  Got to be tasteful.  All right. 
[02:29:30]  Why don't we get this done?  Why don't you guys go back to the lab and do a little research?  You know, yeah.  Get it all together.  Get into it.  To the O&A Institute.  The O&A Institute in the back.  And work it all out.  Where singing's not allowed.  Logistics.  All right.  So we're going to do this in about 15 minutes.  My prediction 15 minutes later is there's going to be a huge crowd downstairs.  You think?  I think so, yeah.  I think so.  That'd be cool.  Dude.  I want to get it to the point where the fucking cops who we love, and they're listening right  now, have to shut it down because we had a Bono impersonator. 
[02:30:00]  That's what I'm looking for today.  That's it.  That's what I'm looking for.  Because they actually did a video shoot on a flatbed, and it shut down the city.  Remember that?  Someone wants to see if Bono can get a cab with a Nazi helmet on.  You're combining bits, sir.  We don't condone the combining of bits.  All right.  We're very excited.  We're just about ready to go.  They're working it out.  We're getting the cables and all that.  Okay.  Brother Joe wants to do something here today, Anthony.  There are also a lot of people with ideas, I guess, on the phone. 
[02:30:30]  I'll get rid of that.  Maybe they got a couple of good ones.  Jason, from his truck.  What's up?  Hey, bu-bu-bu-boys.  All right.  What do you got?  Hey, is there a building short enough around there maybe they could go up on the roof and  do a video shoot?  God, that would be the best.  Well, the rooftop thing, of course, would be good, but no, I don't think there's a short  enough roof in Manhattan.  The Chrysler building.  Yeah.  Is it Kong?  Do we know the guys building that crap across the street?  No.  There's some scaffolding and stuff we get on.  No.  I like the whole sidewalk thing, walking at 57th. 
[02:31:00]  Over and over again, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it's one video camera being held by Sam.  I know.  It just, ugh.  I'll just show you how stupid people are.  I know.  Well, that's what they'll think.  Well, that's what makes it, uh.  They'll think it's something cool.  Well, don't say they're doing a video.  Say they're doing, like, uh, some kind of a charity, uh, thing.  It's just, uh.  Yeah, they don't even have to say what they're doing.  You're right.  It's just the fact that they're, you know, hey, whoever tells you what they're doing  when they're on a fucking crew walking down the sidewalk.  It's just get the fuck out of our shot.  Get out of our way. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Filming Bono doing puns.  Yeah.  Danny!  Exactly.  And Sam, come here.  There's Danny.  They're crucial to the bit.  Danny's the obnoxious one.  These guys are crucial to the bit.  Uh, if people are asking you what's going on, you're just very, very cold.  Like, look, we're in the middle.  We're just shooting Bono, walking down a sidewalk.  Please, please, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're out of our way.  Out of the way.  Yeah.  You gotta be the guy.  You, you've seen how these people really act in real life.  Like, everyone on a movie set or a commercial set or a video set is, there's always that  fucking scumbag. 
[02:32:00]  And that's gonna be you.  You'll have the fun.  I won't have a problem with that at all.  And be over the, like, like, be overly stupid with people.  Like, uh.  That won't be a problem, is it?  One example, if someone's walking with a cup of Starbucks, say, hey, turn that logo  around or we'll have to pixelate it.  Yeah, yeah.  Just go out with tape.  Taping logos.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Get some duct tape.  Yeah.  And tape over people's coffee cup logos.  And like their, their shirt or their shoes or something.  Like, it's a brand that Bono does not endorse. 
[02:32:30]  Steve, what, are you gonna look like a security guy?  You got the sunglasses.  You got, like, a long coat or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Steve can look like a security guy just standing there.  Maybe they'll think that fucking Bono and Stephen Carr are doing a duet.  Is that Stephen Carr from Boundary?  Could you play Pendulum?  I certainly could.  All right.  Very cool.  Are we about ready?  Yeah, exactly so.  Tell Mars these guys set up the microphones, because now we want to, like, do the play-by-play  from above. 
[02:33:00]  Tell us when you're set.  And people are saying, oh, they gotta act like dicks.  Oh, that's not acting.  They know Danny all too well.  And you want Danny to have a mic down there with us, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We need to communicate.  Yeah, we want to be able to hear everything.  Yeah, we want to be able to hear Danny.  You could have headphones on and a mic, and no one's gonna think twice about it.  Yeah, I mean, with Sam, with the camera, we were just talking in the office, it'll just  make it look like I'm the sound guy.  Yeah, you're the sound guy.  Guys, nothing short of a mob is what we're going for today.  Yes. 
[02:33:30]  Don't give up until we get something.  A mob.  And then you'll fire.  You gotta remember, Bono will be calling me, so, you know, something slightly tasteful.  Yeah, we're good.  Danny, maybe just start giving people direction, too.  Like, you stand over here.  You stand over here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And walk when I say, on the count of three, you'll walk.  Yeah, you're not walking, right?  Just get out of here.  So, you know, the chute, basically, is just past our entrance here, maybe 10 feet.  These guys know what I'm talking about. 
[02:34:00]  Down to about the bus stop.  That's it.  This way, this way, right?  Yeah.  And just keep doing it over and over again.  Over and over.  Include people.  Go, look, we need people shooting Bono.  Act natural.  All you gotta do is walk and act natural.  Just walk up the street as we walk down.  Yeah.  And then criticize the shit out of them.  Yeah.  Like, what do you got, polio?  Can't you even walk?  Yeah.  All right.  Just.  Yeah, look at Danny's getting all psyched up for it.  Danny, on the side, they say, what are you doing?  Just tell him, like, well, he's denouncing his charity work. 
[02:34:30]  And this is a video.  All right.  Hey, we got, we get, we get, we get this, announcing his charity work.  Said, they're all a bunch of savages anyway.  I don't care.  Why don't they just live in trees?  All right.  What do we got?  We, the other guy, can he get do security?  Yeah.  Jack?  Yeah.  Yeah, Jack.  All right.  That's a rough one.  As soon as we got microphone. 
[02:35:00]  You heard the story about the Irish guy that Connell was doing a concert over in Dublin.  And he started slowly clapping his hands, like in slow cadence.  Yeah.  And he says to the whole, to the entire, like a huge sold out audience, he says, I, every  time I put my hands together, another child dies in Africa.  And some, some dude in the back of the fucking place goes, well, stop fucking doing it then.  Is that a true story?  It's a true story.  Yeah.  They got him on stage. 
[02:35:30]  He started laughing.  Drunk Irishman.  He started laughing too.  He did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we do this?  How's fucking...  Mars, are we ready?  Clapping my hands.  Every time.  All right.  Let's go over there.  Get these guys downstairs.  Let's do it.  Or do you want to take a break?  Let's take a break.  All right.  We'll take a break.  I got to take a leak.  Look at that, man.  Fucking this kid.  Let's take a fucking break.  That's right.  He reiterated.  I'm still not hooked up.  I'm still on a dead guitar.  That's what I say now.  Guy's coming into his own.  Yep.  He is.  That's right.  You say something.  He fucking repeats it.  He's good. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  When we get back, this is what we do today on the Opie and Anthony show.  When we get back, we are trying to create a mob scene outside the studio.  See what we can do.

Anthony and I are at our perch, looking out the window.  Down onto 57th Street.  These guys are working out the details of the video shoot with the fake Bono, and I  got to tell you, so far, right below us, we got two girls that got autographs.  They're freaking out.  They're not moving. 
[02:37:00]  And then they went to the corner, and all I saw was people taking cameras with their  camera phones and stuff.  And shaking hands.  And shaking hands, and everyone's kind of turning around.  So far, we got about five or six people.  Danny, what's going on down there?  We're ready to go.  We're going to start moving back up the block.  All right.  What did you notice so far?  We saw these two girls get autographs down here.  What else?  Well, we're on the corner right across from Rue.  Yeah.  The corner from Rue, and people are just cell phones.  This one lady gave me her business card to give to him. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Someone must have fainted, Opie, and that ambulance is here.  Right.  I think one of the Bobby Soxers.  I think we're going to start moving up the block now, I guess.  All right.  They're going to do the fake.  Okay.  They're doing the fake video shoot.  Yeah, we're going.  Let's start.  All right.  Let's go.  We got Master Poe and Steve and Jack.  Danny, just stay back a little, please.  Working security.  Don't get in the shot.  Thank you.  Danny, you're being a prick to people.  They're walking up the sidewalk.  Miss, I'm going to have to ask you not to get in the shot, please.  Thank you. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, two people just panicked and walked out of the shot.  Thank you.  Look, they're freaking out.  You guys can hang, but you can't be in the shot.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Sam is working the camera.  Arbano is walking up the sidewalk.  This guy just ran across the street to take a look.  Try not to use a flash, please.  I'm ready to calm down.  Try not to use a flash.  Okay.  No one wants to follow.  They're afraid.  Can we do a back-to-work shot, please?  Yeah, don't make them too scared to follow.  Yeah, Jesus, Danny.  Maybe ask them, you know, hey, you could be in the shot, but you've got to walk right, 
[02:38:30]  and then criticize their walking.  Yeah.  Maybe I should do some extra recruiting, just saying we need a crowd to follow.  Yeah, we need a couple of people behind them.  Okay.  All right, so far, so good.  God, everybody's looking.  Yeah, they really are looking.  See, it's that whole phase where they're looking, and then it'll turn into the bravery of them  coming over.  Now, he's getting into some people on the street as a police officer. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, we're filming.  If you want, you can be in the crowd.  Just follow.  We're going to go down the block.  If you want, that's fine.  All right, Danny's telling these two business guys that just completely turned around.  Master Poe is now holding on to the fake Bono because someone just ran at him to try to  get an autograph.  Just one.  Danny, turn it around so we can see you guys.  You're a little too far right now.  Let's bring it out into the sidewalk a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Where the fuck are they?  I can't see them.  They're way over there.  They're in front of that T.C. Richards.  Yeah, we should turn around and come back the other way. 
[02:39:30]  All right, turn back.  Yeah, just go to the bus stop.  Okay.  All right, they're turning back around.  They're going to do the photo.  Let's turn around.  Let's head back.  Yeah, let's get another shot that way.  I think that's a happy turn down.  All right, listen, Joe.  Geez.  He didn't know he was on the air.  All right, here we go.  No, that's fine.  Joe.  All right.  Sam's got his camera.  They're walking back down the street.  More business people are now joining.  There's more people following. 
[02:40:00]  Dude, if they could just walk up and down the block like this.  Danny, all we want you to do is keep walking up and down the block because obviously you see  the crowd behind you.  Yeah.  There's now 10 to 12 people following the fake Bono.  We're trying to film.  If you want, you could stay, but thank you.  We're trying to film.  Bono just stopped to shake a hand of another person passing by.  They're yelling about it not being Bono.  What's that?  I'm sorry?  Fake Bono?  What's going on, guys?  What happened?  Fake Bono.  What do you mean? 
[02:40:30]  You know what you're doing.  You're conning people.  I know what I'm doing.  You're conning people.  Call him an old fuck.  I look for a newspaper, so I'm going to expose you again.  Don't know.  Don't do that.  Yeah, I am.  Sorry, pal.  We're filming.  We're filming.  What newspaper?  The Economist?  Tell him no one reads that rag.  What newspaper?  What newspaper?  What's the scam?  What newspaper?  No, you tell me.  No, you tell me.  I'm going with the microphone.  All right.  You'll read about it tomorrow.  See you, Big Bono.  What's your name?  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Pause it.  Read about it tomorrow.  See, he writes for The Economist.  No one reads that rag. 
[02:41:00]  What?  He writes for nobody.  He writes menus for a deli.  Oh, the guy's...  He's threatening us because...  Because...  We'll...  Hey, let's keep it moving.  All right.  Keep it moving.  Walk down the sidewalk.  What an ass head.  Oh, good.  The bus just let out.  There's more people walking up the block.  All right.  Those guys listen to this show, and they're just trying to blow up our spot.  Yeah.  Can they give Bono a little room?  There's fucking security all over him. 
[02:41:30]  How about letting him have some room so it doesn't look like there's a video show?  Look at this guy with the backpack running to catch up to the guys.  All right, Danny, what's going on?  Well, look, we'll just...  I don't know.  Is that me or Joe?  No, that's...  I think Jimmy and I are too close.  That's all right.  Go ahead.  Well, we're just kind of hanging about.  We're just kind of staying stagnant right now, just trying to get people to notice.  Yeah.  Walk down to the corner there, I guess.  Hang on.  We got a picture being taken. 
[02:42:00]  You let them take the picture because people see the gathering.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, now he's taking pictures with some more people on the sidewalk.  There is a lot more people on the sidewalk.  Yeah, they're starting to gather.  That's good.  But it's close to 20 people now following the fake Bono wherever he goes.  Sam with the camera.  We got the security around.  He's taking pictures.  People are snapping pictures.  I can't fucking believe this.  They're snapping like crazy. 
[02:42:30]  Camera phones and regular digital cameras.  What was that douche's problem, by the way, Danny?  He works in the building.  No, he doesn't.  He was just, he just said, oh, let's not do real Bono.  I'm going to expose you.  Expose.  Wow.  Expose what?  That's what we're looking for.  That we're this douchebag.  Yeah.  Look at how many more people are kind of congregating.  Okay, guys.  Let's move it down the block a little.  All right.  And now they're walking back down the block.  Back down.  Toward the corner.  A lot of traffic on 57th. 
[02:43:00]  A lot of the cars.  Look at all these people turning around.  Yeah.  What happened when we had fucking Box of Cocks?  We didn't have this many people.  No.  Box of Cocks.  We got to bring that back.  We sure do.  Just for the office.  Yeah, bring it back.  It never went anywhere.  No, it's still in the office.  It's still in the office.  Yeah.  Well.  I say he just keeps walking back and forth.  There's more people walking.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, wow.  There's a big crowd coming across the crosswalk.  Yeah.  So stay on the corner there and let him do something that really shows him.  Yeah.  Like get him alone in one spot so he's not surrounded by so many people.  Give him some room.  Yeah.  Give him some room so these people can see.  Wow.  A lot of people are stopping.  They're slowing down.  They're taking a look.  This lady's running across the street trying to check out the commotion.  What's going on, Danny?  I'm just trying to make sure that he's in the shot.  Oh, we have some ladies. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  Real quick.  We got a photo shoot happening on the corner.  More people.  More people turned around.  Oh, my God.  Look at all these people.  Yeah.  It's starting.  People went across the crosswalk and passed by the scene and then saw that people were  taking pictures, turned around, and came back.  Now the corner is full of people.  Yeah, this is working.  This is actually the corner is working quite well.  Yeah, now stay on the corner.  Stay on the corner, and this will work.  Holy crap.  Look at all these people taking pictures.  It's starting to gel.  Here we go. 
[02:44:30]  It's probably about 20 girls.  I think it took a little while, but it's working.  Whose camera is that?  Anthony, the key to this bit, he's got to keep moving.  If he stops too long, people are going to figure out, wait a minute, something's not  right here.  You know what?  I'll have them all walk behind him, and we'll go down the block again.  All right.  Say, we need people to walk behind Bono for this shot we're doing.  It's just up half a block.  If you want, we can walk with Bono.  Just keep behind him.  If you want to be in the shot, that's fine, but we have to go back off the block.  Is that okay? 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Here we go.  It's just half a block.  Tell him.  Just half a block.  We're going to go mid-block, so if you could, just get behind him, but we need the front  of him cleared, but you can walk behind him.  It's all right.  All right.  Sam is in front, walking backwards, filming the fake Bono.  We now have at least 25 to 30 people around the fake Bono.  They're coming up the sidewalk slowly, but he keeps stopping because people want pictures.  That's smart, though.  Get that crowd interested.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it is. 
[02:45:30]  You've got to get him in.  I just want him to keep moving from time to time just so they don't study him too much.  He's moving.  They're all taking pictures.  They're taking video, right, Danny?  Dude, they can look him.  Yeah, some of the higher-end cameras have video.  They can look him right in the face.  It's amazing.  They just, no one thinks twice about it.  Except for that one curmudgeon who was right.  That old.  Look at this old lady in a coat.  She's panicking.  This lady in a white coat.  She keeps turning around.  She got her picture. 
[02:46:00]  She keeps turning around.  Now he's holding onto a girl and taking a picture with her, with her camera.  He's hugging girls.  Oh, my God.  Another girl.  Big poodle hairdo.  Look at this.  Two more girls getting pictures with the fake Bono.  This is working.  Look at how many people.  Dude, it's hysterical.  There's an old lady.  She's interested now.  We keep getting...  Here's an old lady giving her friend a camera to get a picture with the fake Bono.  Pulled his truck over.  Some guy just pulled out of his truck.  A school group from Canada, so this will be the talk of the... 
[02:46:30]  Dumb fucking Canuck.  Exactly.  Go fuck a moose.  Well, it's an educational fit, but these are the highlights.  Yeah, that's a highlight.  Anthony, we got...  It's not every day that you get...  Hey, you could go to Times Square and meet Spider-Man, too, you dumb fuck.  Wait, people are getting off the bus and fucking running towards him.  No, it's interesting.  We get about 25, 30 people, and then some of those people finally bail to go to work,  and then more people replace them.  Look at this guy off the bus.  The guy just got off the bus with a camera, but saw that the Bono people were moving away 
[02:47:00]  and got back into his car.  Car's honking now.  Yep.  This is good.  Look, there's more of a crowd up the sidewalk a little bit more.  E-Rock.  We should get E-Rock to run up the street with his camera there.  Like a crazy Uber fan?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wait until there's a big crowd, and then make believe you're shooting him or stabbing him.  Oh, dude.  Is that illegal?  That's great.  You stabbed Bono.  That's great. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Walk back down to the corner.  Eric, when there's a lot of people around, they want you to just run up to him like a crazed fan  and just start taking photo after photo.  Run up to him like a crazed fan and then have Poe, like, fucking fuck him up or something.  Yeah.  We're going to have, we're going to have...  Not fuck him up, because that'll scare other people from getting too young.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just, you know, kind of protect them.  Run up to him and start snapping photos.  We've got a guy with a hard hat now following him.  Maybe he'll get too close, and you just kind of have to, you know, get in between a little bit.  You got it.  Okay. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Let's, yeah, let's head, let's head down the block.  We're going to move down again.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  There's people running across the street.  They just jumped out of the fucking, uh...  Guy jumped out of a UPS truck to take a picture.  He's back in his truck.  Look at this.  Look at this old hippie.  Just, he, he keeps turning around.  He's stopping now.  Oh, we got a little girl.  She's totally buying into it.  So many people are going to be like, I was driving down 57th, dude.  Guess who I saw today?  Fucking Bono.  Sam.  I saw Sam. 
[02:48:30]  He was holding the camera.  Sam.  All right.  Sam is taking, uh...  Taking video.  Yell at this girl with a bag.  Yell at her?  Yeah.  She ruined the shot.  Oh, man.  Eh, too late.  Pick, Danny.  What's that?  We got time for a pick?  Yeah, one.  But make it quick, because we gotta, we gotta, we gotta start shooting again.  Real quick.  All right.  A little girl wants her picture with Bono.  She's in New York City with her father.  It's not the real Bono, you adult.  He's from Finland.  He's from Finland?  Yeah.  Finland.  I think he said Helsinki. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, he should stick his, uh...  Bono should stick his tongue down the young guy.  Or else the eight-year-old's nose.  Just make out with her.  Just start making out with her.  In front of her foster.  It's customary in Finland.  Yeah.  I think the whole dumb family is there.  How fucking...  I can't believe it.  They're holding on to a man who does puns.  They're totally buying into this.  Now he's shaking hands with people.  He's shaking all their hands.  And now they're walking back to that corner where they really got a big crowd.  That was my plan. 
[02:49:30]  I'm just gonna hang out on the corner for a little while.  The corner is a huge thing because, of course, you're getting pedestrians from both sides.  And they pass by.  Then they stop.  And they turn back around.  Look at this.  Look at this guy.  They're all looking like, holy shit.  It's fucking...  Did you see that?  It's Bono.  They all keep turning their heads as soon as they pass them.  All right.  They're back on the corner.  It's a good location.  Let's hang out here for a little.  All right.  They're gonna hang out down there.  Yeah.  Hey, Danny.  We'll listen to you for a minute.  Tell us what's going on.  It's hard to see you.  All right.  Well, basically, we're on the corner.  It's just... 
[02:50:00]  It's a little more traffic-y over here than in the middle of the block.  Danny, you know what you can do?  As you're describing what's going on, kind of stand by Bono as they're filming.  So it's almost like you're interviewing them.  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  So...  Here.  I got an extra pair.  And we're just waiting for a nice chunk of people to come by.  It just sucks because if you know the area of the 57th between these blocks, it's just  kind of...  It was just waving at me.  It's just kind of dead.  It's hit or miss, but there are more people coming up.  Who's this old bag in the pink hat?  Ugh.  Ah, she's not interested. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, good.  She's walking away.  I was going to say if she was interested, you got a lambaster.  What is that guy doing with the cowboy hat on?  I don't know.  Fucking text.  We're waiting for the light to change.  Yeah, once the light changes, the back crowd is going to walk over.  Yeah, unfortunately, I don't see a huge grouping.  You guys in the business suit just started.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's three guys in suits.  It's there.  They're keeping their distance.  All right, here we go.  Here's the whole crowd.  Crossing the street.  Here comes some people. 
[02:51:00]  Make sure he's visible.  And, yeah, try to get mics on people that...  Wait, are you texting people?  No, I'm going to take a picture of him.  All right, quick, quickly.  All right.  Another girl wants a picture with the pig panel.  Yeah, because if people see that, he's willing to take pictures.  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I'll take a picture of you guys.  All right, hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  See, they all...  Stay back.  That's fine.  But just stay where you are.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Watch out.  That's fine.  Just stay back a little bit.  Is this the Iraq scam? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Iraq scam's working now.  Well, he does look like a creep.  Iraq with his acting chops.  All right.  Yeah.  I need a picture.  That's fine.  Dolt.  Danny, they're totally buying it, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Awesome.  Absolutely.  Yeah, if they see him taking a couple of pictures, more people are going to stop because  they think he's accessible.  Yeah, let's keep it moving.  Danny.  Yeah.  Have some of our marks start yelling, Bono, Bono, Bono.  All right. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, you've got to kind of let him in on it without people hearing.  Yeah, I know.  I understand.  Yeah, kind of stay there a little, though, because if people start seeing that you're  able to take pictures with Bono, they're going to want to.  Yeah, actually, we're gathering a crowd now.  Yeah, see?  Now there's more of a crowd coming up and more people walking down.  Just stay on the corner.  I say fuck it.  Have him stay on the corner for a while.  Iraq, run around yelling, Bono, like you're trying to get a good shot.  I'd love for him to just go, fuck the Africans. 
[02:52:30]  This big fat girl just hugged him and goes, I love you.  Oh, he should have said you're fat.  Yes.  Get away from me.  She's still hugging him.  I'm used to looking at children with AIDS.  They're skinny.  They're a fat fucking cunt.  She's crying.  She's crying?  Because she's fat.  Yeah.  That's just gravy leaking out of her eyes.  She's crying.  This guy's running down the sidewalk to join the crowd.  Oh, the bus just let out, too.  Look, more people running.  There's people running to see what's going on.  Flashes are going off. 
[02:53:00]  I see nothing but flashes at this point.  Bono.  Bono.  Crying fat girl.  That's great.  Yeah, that was definitely the best thing.  You're a fat cunt.  Yeah, you're a fat cunt.  You remind me of an elephant I saw when I was in Africa.  We're all right.  It's cool.  Yeah, it's fine.  Sorry.  I would love for the Bono to just go off on people.  Oh, awful Bono. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, look, and there's a limo parked right there now.  That makes it look really authentic.  Hey, Danny, walk up to the sidewalk slowly.  We got a limo.  That might help out the situation.  I don't know if it's going to pull over here.  It's pulling into the bus lane, so it might stop here.  That would kind of be a great prop.  Let's move a little bit.  Let's go.  You guys can walk along if you want, but stay back.  Is he stopping?  That would be huge if the limo stopped for us.  No, he seems to be going back into the other lane. 
[02:54:00]  I think this is working.  Yeah, hang out in the corner there.  Fuck it.  I think the limo stopped there because he was trying to figure out what the hell was going on.  Wouldn't that be funny if Bono was in the limo?  Like, what the fuck?  Everyone's checking out their pictures as they walk away from the corner.  Oh, it's a big thrill.  They're in New York City.  It's fine.  No, it's all right.  We're meeting Bono.  What's going on, Danny?  We're just crowd gathering.  People are staring.  They want to take pictures.  More people coming up.  Some people just kind of look and not quite sure what to make of it all. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  Sam is now filming again.  They're walking up the sidewalk a little bit.  Back up the block.  Very nice.  Hi.  What are they saying?  Love you what?  Yeah, love you.  Everything.  This one definitely wants.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  You fucking cunt.  Wouldn't you love it?  Too bad the guy doesn't.  Who wants to suck Bono's cock?  People getting out of the cab. 
[02:55:00]  The door is open before.  No.  Wow.  Look at all these people just stopping, looking.  They think it's him, man.  It's amazing.  Oh, the News Channel 4 truck.  It's cool.  It's all right.  We can hang out.  There's a News Channel 4 truck right there, Danny.  You see it?  Yeah, I do.  Make sure they get a good look at Bono.  I'm taking the guys.  The guy's hanging out of the window with a camera.  Is he?  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, this would be great.  Holy shit.  I think he's trying to.  Oh, I thought he was trying to turn around.  Yeah, he was definitely.  He definitely took a few.  He definitely saw, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  God, if we could get a fucking News Truck over here, that would be classic.  Tell Bono, we'll give him 500 views to shit on the sidewalk.  This is what I do.  Do you know this is how people in Africa have to take a dump?  Yes.  This is how the bitch should end.  With him just doing something really, really bad.  Doing something completely inappropriate.  Yeah.  Oh, there are no toilets in Africa. 
[02:56:00]  People shit on the side of the road like I'm doing now.  And then they eat it because they're hungry.  People got an autograph, pictures.  Yeah, they got a nice crowd again building.  Yeah, very nice.  We should get him on that flatbed that's going by.  Oh, yeah.  It's going by a mile an hour.  But he'll just look like a guy who does puns on a flatbed.  Right, right.  Puns.  All right, we got it.  Wow, this is the biggest crowd right now.  Yeah, now it's building back up. 
[02:56:30]  It builds back up and then people leave to go to work.  It's because awful people have to work.  Now there's another couple coming over.  Let's see if they bite, become part of the crowd.  Yep, they're stopping.  Someone's got to yell.  Hello.  You can take a picture just real quick.  Someone's got to yell Bono again, Danny.  Yeah.  E-Rock or somebody.  You want a picture?  Make them say something real stupid like,  Bono, I love the work you're doing in Africa. 
[02:57:00]  You're a true humanitarian.  Yeah, like make them say something stupid just to goof on E-Rock.  I could care about Bono shit.  I want E-Rock to look really stupid.  Yeah, I need him to get out of your shot of other people.  Yeah, of course.  Wow, look.  Everyone just taking their pictures, huh, Danny?  Yeah, actually, if you guys can't see,  but we're right in front of a bank,  and if the second floor of the bank is just lined with people,  they'll just look you down.  Oh, they're all looking out the window now?  They'll just look you down.  That's great.  Girok, just be like Bono. 
[02:57:30]  Bono, I love what you're doing with AIDS in Africa.  With AIDS in Africa.  Keep spreading it.  All right.  Bono's slowly walking back up the sidewalk.  Some lady with a dog.  Just yell, Bono, Bono.  Bono, I love what you're doing with AIDS in Africa.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What an awful delivery.  Girok stinks.  So much for this bit.  That was funny.  A picture.  Sure.  I wish he'd get AIDS.  He should. 
[02:58:00]  No one of the charity work.  Makes Steve look like Olivier.  They delivered that fucking line.  What are you doing in my fucking T-cells?  I love what you're doing in Africa with AIDS.  Back up the sidewalk.  Do you see we want to walk up and cry?  This one lady will not leave Bono's side.  No, she loves him.  All abroad.  She loves a fake Bono.  She keeps trying to get his ear.  Yeah, this one's chatting. 
[02:58:30]  I'm up.  Who are those tourists up there by the Salisbury?  Let's go find out.  Oh, yeah.  They're packing into a limo.  I could give a shit what you're fucking saying, lady.  All right.  Let's go back.  Oh, yeah.  There's a bunch of tourists over there.  Let's go for a little bit.  They're getting into the limo.  Everyone knows Bono.  Yeah.  See if they react.  Scoop to the side a little bit.  Thank you.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  They're making a point.  All right.  Here we go.  Now tell me, Bono. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, my God.  The whole crowd noticed.  They're all just...  They all stopped loading up the limo.  Danny, what's going on?  Well, we just ran into a huge group of tourists from Argentina.  Argentina.  And they all just are kind of staring.  Cry for them.  Savage country.  In awe.  Now they're shaking his hand.  I see that.  Taking pictures.  Try to get the mic closer.  Hey.  Oh, okay.  I don't speak English.  Isn't that amazing, though, how fucking well-known Bono is? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I know.  And how awful Iraq is.  Yeah.  I hear some.  Like the guy...  Tourists from any fucking country will know who that guy is.  Jesus Christ.  Shut Bono to steal their limo.  Sorry, I need this more than you do, you fucking savage.  I like your Bono.  I wish I was Bono down there. 
[03:00:00]  It's pretty bad past here.  I think we're ripping people apart.  Yeah.  I think we should probably make another pass back down there.  Someone should get E-Rock at acting class.  Yeah, you should walk back down to the corner and we'll see what happens there again.  Now all the Argentinians took their cameras out of their bags.  Oops.  Oh, really?  They're taking it out of their luggage bags.  Because they were about to get us...  Oh, they're all packed.  Yeah, so everything's packed away.  Oh, good.  See how much cocaine falls out of one of their assholes.  They're all smuggling their cameras.  Let me pull the camera out of my ass. 
[03:00:30]  There's a guy where...  That's the same joke three times.  We're in front of a hotel and somebody just came out there wearing their pajama bottoms.  This guy with the long hair is freaking out.  He's almost crying.  Which guy?  There's a guy with like a...  The guy with the pajama pants is freaking out.  Well, why don't you get him on mic, Danny.  They're singing.  They're singing.  Danny, get him on mic, the guy that's almost crying.  Ask him if he's okay.  You all right, man?  Yes.  All right.  Can we sing again?  Big Bono fan.  Do it again for the camera.  Let's sing again.  Let's do it again for the camera. 
[03:01:00]  Don't cry for me, Argentina.  The truth is I'm not going to let you all through my wild days.  I'm not going to let him sing.  Don't let Bono sing.  Do it in Spanish.  Yeah, don't let him sing.  Don't let me sing.  I'm a lipstick.  I'm a lipstick.  Oh, fuck.  Is that a part of Jerry? 
[03:01:30]  I'm sending you back to Argentina.  You need to love the song.  What's up with you?  Thank you for your time.  All right.  They're all thanking him and everything.  All right.  Let's head back down the sidewalk again.  You might even know that I saw one of those.  Fat bitch.  Are you heading back down?  Yeah.  How dare she.  You ready?  We're going to make one more pass.  Okay.  Bravo.  Yeah, bravo.  We're heading back down.  We really need E-Rock to yell Bono, Bono, Bono a lot as you guys are walking.  E-Rock's got to be the real bad fan.  And just keep, like, thanking Bono for all of his work that he's done. 
[03:02:00]  Matt from Mansfield is a cunt.  What did that guy just say?  Matt from Mansfield is a cunt.  He has a line to deliver.  I was holding the mic behind my back to tell E-Rock what to do.  He got it.  He got it.  All right.  What's going on, Danny?  The Argentinians have taken Bono over.  Come on.  Let's head down the block.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Fucking Argentinians.  Listen to E-Rock. 
[03:02:30]  E-Rock is the worst actor.  He can't even play a fan.  Love you, too.  Bono!  Stop here.  Oh, fucking E-Rock.  He's hysterical.  Bono!  Bono!  Listen to that tool.  He ran up to the school bus to give a few high fives.  Ah.  This is working out great.  It's so fucking funny. 
[03:03:00]  That one guy was crying.  Not correct, but he's driving.  Same guy.  I feel like...  Just waves.  They're making their way.  They're just about below us now.  Tell E-Rock D.L. Bono a couple more times.  And have him, like, say that he loves what he's doing.  Love you, Bono!  He's lost the red line at Gap!  Those t-shirts.  Fight AIDS!  Fight AIDS.  Fight E-Rock. 
[03:03:30]  Fight Bono!  E-Rock's worse than AIDS.  Bono, can I give you a tussle?  Bono!  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, E-Rock is hysterically bad.  He's running alongside Bono.  The bus stop.  There's some people at the bus stop.  Oh, some woman seems to be...  When are you playing in New York again, Bono?  Oh, he's great.  Oh, that's good.  He's just kind of lagging behind trying to yell at him. 
[03:04:00]  It's great.  Keep going, E-Rock.  When are you playing in New York?  Oh, look.  He got one.  See?  He yelled Bono, and the girl turned around and went like, oh, fuck.  She stopped dead in her tracks.  Yeah, now she's following.  How needy is Bono?  He's got to go to 57th Street to get looked at him.  And walk up and down.  This block sucks.  No, you guys are doing pretty good, actually.  All right.  There you have people crossing now.  I'm going to go for the old corner trick again.  I'm getting the old corner gag of pictures with E-Rock. 
[03:04:30]  What have you, Bono?  You two rules.  You two rules.  Stupid, Eric.  Danny, tell him to jump up and down like an Uber fan.  It's working, though.  It's making people stop.  It's so funny.  Yeah, look.  Someone's turning around with a camera.  I guess a YouTube fan just ran up to Eric and was like, is that Bono?  He's like, yeah.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, man.  It's fucking, but can't you hear how excited I am? 
[03:05:00]  Mr. Faber-Sham, that is YouTube's Bono.  It is YouTube's Bono.  Yeah, like a few people behind, obviously.  Oh, the bus is going crazy now.  The bus is, uh, a lot of people.  Yeah, the bus is freaking out.  And he's letting a lot of people out.  Let's see what happens here.  Oh, wow.  We got the biggest crowd yet.  Tell him to jump up.  Oh, look at, look at, look at, he's jumping on one of the security guys back and he's snapping  pictures.  Keep going, E-Rock. 
[03:05:30]  I'm being obnoxious, buddy.  I got a photo in there.  I'm being fucking obnoxious.  Why can't everyone else get a photo in there?  Just keep Bono's fucking space.  Keep away full body.  He's a big star.  That's not even one of our guys, by the way.  That's this guy, a professional wrestler with his acting, too?  He's a big star.  And he's got to take the bus.  Oh, brother.  Well, this was very successful. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, that's a lot of fun, man.  We were hoping to get like a mob scene, but it still did its trick.  Times Square would be perfect.  It's a weird spot, 57th.  But, like, I'm surprised.  They got huge crowds.  But 57th is weird.  It's people going to work.  Right.  You know the best place for this?  Just tell him to run into the street and kill himself.  Throw himself under that bus before we do.  I wonder if we should go and you want to try Starbucks real fast or you want to, like, wrap it up? 
[03:06:30]  We should have him go into a place.  Yeah, maybe Starbucks.  Starbucks would be.  Yeah.  Have him go into Starbucks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And, like, tell the people in Starbucks that, you know, they're doing a little video and, you know,  we want you to get Bono his coffee or something.  All right.  Yes.  Yeah, that works.  Just wing it.  He won't let any blacks touch his coffee.  White people only.  I don't want any fucking niggers touching my coffee.  Okay.  We're going to head across the street to Starbucks. 
[03:07:00]  I would love obnoxious, racist Bono.  Completely against everything he's worked for.  For all these years, he ruins in one day with an imposter.  Yeah.  Suck my fucking cock, you cunt.  All right.  They're walking back to the corner.  Yeah, we're heading back to 6th, then we're going to cross.  Oh, then they're going to cross over.  Yeah, head back up to Starbucks.  Go to the newsstand and have Bono buy a fucking gay men's porno magazine. 
[03:07:30]  I want Bono to buy a honcho and read it in Starbucks.  I want honcho magazine, something with big black cocks.  Unclipped.  Unclipped.  I want his cock alone to look like one starving African.  Heads on fire.  Yeah, they're waiting for the don't walk sign to change, and then they're going to cross  over.  Yeah, you're going to hear the mic cut out. 
[03:08:00]  I've got to change the batteries.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  That's what's happening when something big is going to happen.  All right.  They're crossing the street.  He's changing the battery real quick.  The big event will occur.  Fucking Bloomberg will come over and think it's him.  Okay.  Get shot.  He'll get the battery in right when it all ends.  Right.  Now we're across the street.  All right.  Now they're going to cross.  Like a copy of black cock.  What happened to E-Rock as an Uber fan?  He sucks.  Uber fan, E-Rock. 
[03:08:30]  He's like fucking.  Tell him to just keep going.  He's got to keep doing it.  Yeah.  Tell the other guy to let him do it.  Bono!  With that girl voice he's got.  Bono!  Bono!  Bono!  E-Rock.  Bono!  Bono!  Oh, fucking E-Rock is the worst.  It's great.  I'm embarrassed for him.  He's horrid.  He's awesome.  Say something else about his work. 
[03:09:00]  I love you, man.  I love you, man.  You too.  Oh, those two.  Yeah, those two bit.  Those two bit.  He's pointing.  Thumbs up.  A point and a thumbs up from those two fans.  And now he's like stopping and going, no, that was Bono.  All right.  They're walking up towards Starbucks.  Yeah.  They got more people walking down also.  So, um, where's the other Starbucks? 
[03:09:30]  Where's E-Rock?  Come on, E-Rock.  E-Rock's got to keep.  Bono!  He just yells Bono's name.  Bono!  What a tool.  What a fucking idiot.  Oh, I love what an ass he is.  All right.  Bono!  What did he say?  Fighting AIDS!  Bono!  Fighting AIDS.  All right.  They're, uh, are they just about up to the Starbucks? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, we're a few storefronts away.  Getting a lot of looks still, huh, Danny?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God, that is too far.  People are intimidated, I think, because they see the camera and, like, they don't want to  ruin the shot.  Yeah, when you stop and they start, uh, taking pictures, that's when everybody knows that  he's accessible.  Hey, Danny, you can stay right outside Starbucks so we can still get you on mic here.  Okay.  Right.  Hey, uh, Sam, let's just, we're going to hang out with the front.  Who farted? 
[03:10:30]  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Jimmy just farted.  I got caught up in the excitement.  Or is that just the waft of Iraq's acting coming up through the window?  We'll keep to the side a little bit so that everybody can see.  All right.  We're right outside Starbucks.  Yeah.  Everybody's just staring.  We should give them a protest sign that says, like, Starbucks is pro-AIDS.  Well, their coffee is made from African feet. 
[03:11:00]  Ground-up, dried African toes.  Toes, right.  Little toes.  Little baby toes.  The toes of little babies.  Little baby pinky toes.  That's what they make their fucking coffee from.  All right.  More people taking pictures outside Starbucks.  Yeah.  Starbucks is the place to be for a Bono.  Boy, they're down there.  Hard to get a good look.  Danny, what's up?  Just kind of wait.  Everybody's online.  I guess their Starbucks is more important. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Is Bono outside?  Yeah.  You know, to be honest with you, we look extremely conspicuous.  Of course you do.  Because we're just hanging out.  You should have just walked in there with him.  Yeah, I know.  Fucking needy Bono.  Well, you might be just taping something or talking.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Can the mic work inside Starbucks?  It'll probably start cracking up a little.  Can we give it a try?  Yeah.  Tell Iraq to yell when he's online.  Yeah.  Iraq's got to be the total dick inside Starbucks that won't leave Bono alone.  He's like all the way down the block. 
[03:12:00]  Tell Marlon Brand dope.  Hey, Iraq, we're going to go into Starbucks.  We're going to Starbucks right now.  So I want you to come in and be behind us in line just yelling and being embarrassed.  Danny, you've got to stay close to the door so we can hear you.  Yeah.  Well, the line is extremely long, so that won't be a problem.  Okay.  Just get in there so we can hear you.  Bono will just wait in line with everybody else.  Go inside.  You want to go inside?  The camera can get in there first?  Yeah.  Go inside and then have Iraq from inside the store just yell, Bono, and everyone will turn 
[03:12:30]  around.  Bono, love your work with AIDS.  Yeah.  Bono, we're going to head inside real quick.  Some bull dyke just gave him hair gel.  All right, come on in.  All right, they're going into Starbucks.  You know what we're doing with this, guys?  We'll get a cup of coffee.  Get a cup of coffee.  And then, you know, that'll be the shot.  Where's E-Rock?  Yeah.  Bono!  All right, you have a photo with Bono?  No, just hang out. 
[03:13:00]  Just hang out.  Okay, well, I just picked up some bad head manipulator.  And explain that to me in English.  I couldn't.  You can't.  Oh, God.  Can you listen to an iPad, darling?  All right.  Anything I know?  Is there a fiasco?  You guys can't film in here.  What's that?  No film.  Oh, we can't film in here.  It's weird.  But it's Bono.  It's not film.  It's digital.  We're just doing something real quick.  It's just for some extras on DVD.  Is that all right?  You can just film in here. 
[03:13:30]  Don't worry.  It's just for some extra stuff.  It's nothing that's going to be broadcast.  I can't have a film in here.  All right.  Oh, man.  Bono.  Bono hates Starbucks.  Tell him Bono hates Starbucks.  Bono will not be supporting Starbucks on the DVD release.  On the DVD.  Go to the Warriors Cafe.  Yeah.  Eric, tell Eric to yell.  Let's go to Jamba Juice.  Tell Eric to yell at Starbucks for throwing out Bono.  He threw Bono out. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, what a dick.  Oh, he sucks so good, man.  How is he?  Oh, he is so bad.  He's so bad.  It's great.  What happened in there, Danny?  Were people buying into it?  Well, I think they all, I mean, they had all kind of sauce outside just mingling and they  thought something was going on.  So when we actually did go inside, they just, yeah, they were just unamused.  They kind of figured it out, I think.  Who is this ass from San Diego?  All right, they're walking back toward the building here. 
[03:14:30]  This could be it.  A lot of people on that side of the street, so let's see what develops.  Yeah, why don't you tell them to walk down the yellow line and wave at Cabs?  He's this codependent Bono, needs a hug.  He's being noticed.  Just walking up and down hoping someone recognizes him.  How great is this?  Pat Duffy is like playing the part of running fan.  Yeah.  He lags behind and then runs up to Bono.  And runs up. 
[03:15:00]  Filming.  Yep, people looking.  They've got a couple of more people on the hook.  People turning around.  They love to look at Bono.  Even if he's fake Bono.  Danny's got his camera.  Is he actually taping this?  I believe so.  Or is he just a prop today?  There are these two thug life dudes.  They keep looking back here every two seconds.  They want to mug Bono.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[03:15:30]  I've helped your people, you fucks.  It's probably like a gang initiation.  There they go.  Yeah, Times Square would be great.  Somewhere where there's just nothing but fucking tourists.  Yeah, no one's outside.  Tell Iraq to yell.  Iraq's too quiet.  We want jumping and shouting Iraq.  Yeah.  At the corner where the people are, Iraq's got to lose his mind. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  And go, but you don't understand.  I love Bono.  His work.  Say more than just, Bono.  Yeah.  It's got to be.  I want to hear him improv.  It's got to be more than just Bono.  You have to go crazy.  You don't understand.  I'm your biggest fan.  Blah, blah, blah.  Like, you've got to be a little more creative.  I got all your albums.  And just talk about his work with AIDS and starving children.  Yeah.  Make some shit up.  I want to hear your improv skills, Iraq. 
[03:16:30]  Some attention.  All right.  They're just about at the corner again.  I think you were on the corner.  And I guess he's going to run up and just do his thing.  His awful shit.  Yeah.  His terribleness that he does.  A lot of people coming up.  It seems like I'm seeing more people.  Yeah, because right now we're right in front of the subway in Dwayne Reed.  Get an On Bono sign.  He can hold.  All right.  We're just going to wrap this up in a couple minutes here. 
[03:17:00]  I know.  It's just interactive radio.  Tell Bono to slap Eric in the face.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He's fighting AIDS and helping kids in Africa.  Bono, you're a big fan.  Bono, I love you.  Bono.  Bono.  They just roughed up Iraq.  They just roughed up Iraq.  Chill.  What a dope.  Oh, he stinks. 
[03:17:30]  He saved a bit, though.  Yes, he did.  E-Rog.  You're a true humanitarian.  I love you.  Bono.  Bono.  I'm a true humanitarian.  And you're a true boob.  Danny, are people buying it or what?  Not really.  Well, actually, this guy is a truck driver guy.  Yeah.  There you go.  Eric said you help kids.  Kids.  Eric is so over the top.  He's so over the top is what it is.  Tell him.  Exactly. 
[03:18:00]  He's got to yell louder.  Bigger than Jesus.  Bigger than Jesus.  Bigger than Jesus.  Hey, tell him to yell the Africans had it coming.  Oh, no.  He's Bono.  Yeah.  Don't be effed.  You haven't done anything.  He's carrying AIDS.  He's helping kids in Africa.  You're crossing a street pulling your pants off.  We have a situation there.  What happened?  Who is going to another subway, Tom? 
[03:18:30]  Holy shit.  He's arguing with some big faculty.  We got running women.  Running women.  Running women.  Running women.  Uh-oh.  When they hear the...  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Real quick.  Just...  Hi.  It's me again.  Oh, no.  Iraq's got to berate everybody that comes up to take a picture that they're not worthy.  Tell the people they're not worthy of taking a picture with Bono.  Have Iraq yell that at them. 
[03:19:00]  You're not worthy of a picture with Bono.  Somebody get that guy out of here.  You're not worthy.  Scary black guy taking a picture of Bono.  Hey, Bono!  I want a photo with Bono.  Back self.  Holy shit.  He doesn't know their music.  Bono! 
[03:19:30]  Bono!  I'm just going to tackle you.  Taking pictures in the street.  Bono!  The best is that they're continuing to take pictures as security has Eric pinned on the  ground in the chokehold.  They're just continuing.  Oh, look.  Can I get a picture too, Bono?  They don't care about Iraq.  Neither do we.  Oh! 
[03:20:00]  Eric's still selling it.  Yeah.  Of course he is.  He's using all of his wrestling acting abilities.  All right.  All right.  Bring him back this way and we'll call it a day on this bit.  It's great to see you.  What's good?  Really?  I admire you so much.  I can't believe I really found this thing.  Yeah, neither can we.  That's not one of ours, by the way.  That's a dummy.  I'm going to bring my own paparazzi.  Apparently.  A dummy buying into it.  What are you doing here?  Looking for niggers to save. 
[03:20:30]  I would just love for him to say one inappropriate thing.  We're running out of time.  Let's go.  Would you love it?  All right.  What are you doing here?  We're not just fucking women.  All right.  Molesting children.  Yeah.  I'm touching children.  Then I'm leaving.  All right.  I wouldn't fuck you after 50 Guinness.  I like how I'm just holding random cables that aren't plugged into anything just to make 
[03:21:00]  me look more official.  Yeah.  Like a guy that's going to be with Bono is just going to have random cables.  He'll just have his cables with them connected to nothing.  Not going anywhere.  All right.  They're walking back up the sidewalk.  Here's a girl with a white coat.  Yeah.  Bono's getting cold.  We got to start heading down.  All right.  Bono's getting cold.  Bono's getting cold. 
[03:21:30]  Well, that was awesome.  Yeah.  Here they come.  Iraq was a true champ at being the biggest asshole I've ever fucking heard on the street.  Oh, he's atrocious.  Wow, is he bad.  He saved a bit.  Yeah.  He did.  All right, guys.  Great job.  Great job.  That was great.  We'll see you upstairs, and we'll continue in just a bit.

Ah, that worked out pretty good, I would say. 
[03:23:00]  I know that was fun because I didn't realize how much my hands were freezing.  Oh, shitty.  Jeez.  They were hanging out the window.  At least I had my coat on.  That's chilly.  You want to put your, you know, it helps if you put them on your, by your bag, actually.  Yeah.  No, I put them under my thighs.  I'll put them by your bag.  Put them under your ball bag.  It's like, you know, resting a bean bag. 
[03:23:30]  No, then my ball bag will get cold.  Hey, who thought it was the real Bono out there?  Steve just said.  E-Rock.  Well, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock was the best.  Sidney Pollack, the director.  Yeah, Sidney Pollack, the director, was, um.  Bought into it.  Walking by.  Yeah.  And bought it totally.  Where's E-Rock?  I want to talk to E-Rock about his acting.  I mean, he was pretty good.  E-Rock's acting is so bad.  Oh, my God.  Were we laughing?  He puts the emphasis, you helped change in Africa.  We were laughing at you so hard, E-Rock. 
[03:24:00]  You're acting.  Oh, my God.  You're acting is atrocious.  Bono.  Bono.  With your fucking Peter Brady, it's time to change voice when you're yelling.  Bono.  Bono.  I love the work you do with AIDS.  Bono there with a test tube.  Fantastic.  You did a bang-up job there at E-Rock.  It was fun, bro.  You did really good.  Really good.  Did you have fun?  It's almost like wrestling.  Your favorite thing ever. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  You got to play a part.  Any observations?  Well, before all this started, we were going down the staircase, and someone on the fifth  floor comes bolting out and pushes Pat and I aside as he goes flying down the stairs,  just plowing through everybody out there.  He wanted to be the first to see Bono.  Oh, he was.  Stood out there for a few minutes.  He had that blank stare on his face, couldn't say or do anything, and then just turned around  and ran back into the building.  Jesus.  What about the crying women?  Yeah, there was a few of them. 
[03:25:00]  The tourists that came in in front of the hotel over there, they didn't realize who  he was until...  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh.  God damn it, Jim.  Okay.  I need to spray.  Daddy, please.  Holy shit.  Beyond Brutal.  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  Holy fuck, it's getting worse, Jimmy.  That was 10 minutes ago.  Well, whatever.  Never made it down this way.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The model has left the building.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[03:25:30]  Jesus.  Oh, now it's started.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Go ahead, I'm sorry.  So, those tourists in front of the hotel, once they figured out who it was, the guys,  they were all wearing pajama pants, were really excited.  And then the people in Starbucks just were so annoyed.  So annoyed.  What the fuck is with Starbucks?  What are they...  What...  Is it a nuclear fucking plant over there that you can't film?  What secrets are going on in Starbucks that there's no cameras?  It wasn't even just the workers.  The people in there reading the newspapers or doing whatever were looking up and just 
[03:26:00]  giving you that death stare like, get out of here.  Let's close down Starbucks.  Yeah, man.  Let's sneak a rat into Starbucks.  Corporate...  Corporate coffee, man.  All it takes is one rat.  Let's sneak a rat into Starbucks.  That's it.  Then you can jump up and yell,  RAD!  There's our rat!  Our rat is in here.  Our rat in here.  Our rat in here.  I'm your...  You're not worthy to take a picture with Bono.  Remember our Faber-Sham? 
[03:26:30]  Remember our old pal Pete Radovich?  Yes.  He said...  Oh, did I just lose it?  Oh, no.  That was awesome.  I was watching from my car on 57th.  He fucking looked like Bono.  Oh, yeah.  He watched the whole thing from his car out there.  Peace.  He's actually not the singer of either band.  I don't know if I made that clear.  But he's not going to be doing the shows with us that are upcoming.  No, that's Paul Mahas and Brian DeVoe.  Those are our regulars.  Ah!  But this man over here will be hanging out for the next few days in New York, 
[03:27:00]  and I figured we'd hook up and hang through one.  That's cool.  You should have said that two hours ago.  Isn't that just the worst?  No, man.  What?  What happened?  Who fucking...  Jimmy fucking...  Jimmy has a knack of doing that.  Why is the fake Bono holding his nose?  Jimmy has a knack of...  I walked right here, man.  The paint was coming up the wall.  You spray that Lysol, it just smells like someone's shit in a pine tree.  It's horrible.  Even that's better than just plain shit.  You got two YouTube bands, and he's not in either one. 
[03:27:30]  No, he's not in either one.  He's actually got his own band out in...  Used to.  Used to.  Chicago.  I had my own band in Southern California called Desired.  Good guys.  Good guys I worked with for a long time.  But, you know, I couldn't make a living out of it,  so I joined a band out in Chicago.  That's a real surprise you couldn't make a living out of it.  You can, absolutely you can.  No, I'm surprised you couldn't make a living out of it.  Like, what could possibly be wrong if you look just like Bono,  and you can't make a living from a YouTube tribute band?  You know, I don't know if you know in Southern California,  the club owners want you to bring a whole draw.  They want all that whole crap, 
[03:28:00]  but they don't even want to pay you.  Some place you've got to audition.  Yeah.  It's like, I don't get it.  Been through that.  It's crazy.  Stupid auditioning.  You should just say, look at me.  I look like the guy.  That should be good enough.  Absolutely.  You need a scumbag like me doing the business.  That's what you need.  Yeah.  Wow, you actually, so you failed the audition?  Is that what you're getting at?  No, man.  They just want you to bring it down to people.  If you're looking like Bono, how could you fail the audition?  Bunch of monkeys.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm with you.  Take Bono.  Take Bono. 
[03:28:30]  Faux Bono.  All right.  Joe, you want to try your bit?  I'll do it, man.  I'm ready.  What do you got?  Joe wants to try something.  I think it's a good idea.  All right.  We go to the phones.  You name a song.  Joe plays it.  Joe thinks he can figure out any song.  Any song.  Any song.  Joe is like a human dilette.  I could get a piece of it anyway.  Better than a human dilette.  It's got to be a guitar song, obviously.  We go classic rock.  You know, let's put parameters. 
[03:29:00]  You want some parameters?  No parameters.  Whatever song you want.  I got one.  Come Out of My House by Rosemary Clooney.  Ooh.  How does it go, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've never heard that one.  Come Out of My House.  Come Out of My House.  Wait.  Do we have that in dilette?  It's a very...  I've never heard it.  I know.  Oh.  Kind of close. 
[03:29:30]  Come Out of My House by Rosemary Clooney.  My house.  It's a real song.  Wow.  It is.  Come Out of My House.  My house.  I'm going to give you apple, apple, lime.  And I forgot to do it.  Come Out of My House.  My house.  How does Jimmy know this song?  Well, that's...  You're a bad guy.  Of course you do.  Come Out of My House.  It's like a ska thing and all...  Come Out of My House.  I'm going to give you 50 bucks when you're done.  I'd rather listen to Fake Bono.  Thanks very much, man. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, no worries, bro.  I'm a big U2 fan myself.  No, it's got to be something we know.  I know.  All right.  Jimmy, give him a song you know.  Could you do Freebird by Skinner?  Oh, that's easy.  I know.  How about...  If I'm going to do Freebird, I might as well do Stairway to Heaven.  Denied.  Very good. 
[03:30:30]  All right.  Now the phones are lit.  Just waiting for a minute.  Yes.  I'll do anything.  All right.  We'll call it classic rock.  Any classic rock song.  Doesn't matter what it is.  Okay.  Let me think.  Come on.  I've probably played all of them with you.  Anything you can mention.  You've probably sung it one time or another.  It's some drunken fucking gig.  How about some Metallica?  Fade of Black or...  Metallica?  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  Go ahead, Anthony.  Anthony, give me something to go on.  Master of Puppets.  This would qualify.  I understand, man.  This is the one every Metallica fan hates, but it does qualify.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:31:30]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, da-da-da, da, little Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Let's start now, people.  How about Scott in Jersey?  What's up, Scott?  Hey, man.  I want to hear Outlaws, Greengrass, High Tides.  Ah, there we go. 
[03:32:00]  There you go.  Let's go to Keith and Plot.  How do you know where to put your fingers?  I don't understand this.  He boosts his hands.  He's not even looking.  You think it was the real guitar player?  I think it was the real?  I think it was the real Bono.  Keith? 
[03:32:30]  Sure, man.  It looks like him.  I'm up for anything.  You've got to keep coming.  Rapid fire.  Yeah, rapid fire.  Okay, who do we got?  Keith, what's up?  Yeah, Keith.  Keith!  Keith, you got a song?  Hello, Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, Steve.  What's up, Steve?  What do you got?  No problem.  How about some Dimebag, Pantera, Cemetery Gate?  You know, I mean, it's a little more metal.  If I heard, if I, well, here was the bit.  If I could hear a half a second of it, I can cop it.  There goes the bit. 
[03:33:00]  I don't...  You got approval.  I have a second.  It was the applause.  There we go.  All right, there you go.  There's a little piece of Pantera.  There you go.  There you go. 
[03:33:30]  There's a little piece of it.  It's the step-down version.  Well, I'm not going to be singing like...  I'm not going to be singing like Bruce.  Like...  Kill me.  Sing like...  Sing like Dio.  Sing like...  Testicles would fly out of my mouth.  Christopher Cross, sailing. 
[03:34:00]  Stop.  I'm going to leave the room.  Come on.  Yeah.  I'm sailing.  People are requesting...  Rick Bono, I know how you feel.  Maybe you could...  For...  For the Van Halen Band.  You'd probably get David Lee Roth as the fucking lead singer. 
[03:34:30]  He's not very busy.  By the way, don't forget to leave with these parting gifts.  Harry Potter's Big Fat Cop.  Jesus Christ.  Let's go to T-Bone in Tampa.  T-Bone.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  I was wondering if I could play Fearless by Pink Floyd.  Fearless by Pink Floyd.  Yeah.  Do you know what?  The metal album.  This bit sucks.  Oh, my God.  Do you know any Pink Floyd? 
[03:35:00]  This bit sucks.  Do you know any songs that...  I mean, if somebody says Pink Floyd, yeah.  Well, okay.  Well, okay.  I know that one.  I mean, there's, you know, say Pink Floyd, I'll play something by...  So you're saying bands instead of bands.  Songs, you know...  How about genre?  Genre.  Rock and roll.  How about some U-2? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Old stuff.  I don't care.  Outbell Bill.  Mood for a Day.  Mood for a Day by Yes.  Stop.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got one for my buddy.  Yeah.  Hasn't played this one in a long time.  He tells me this guitar can do anything.  Hey, Joe, how about Mood for a Day?  He's right in the middle of it.  Are you kidding me?  No.  I think that he's in the pick.  He's got a finger pick.  He's got a finger pick. 
[03:36:00]  All right. 
[03:36:30]  There you go.  All right.  It's like we were watching a guitar player's fingers.  I know.  It's like arthritis and fluid movement at the same time.  I knew that was coming.  Listen to Bill.  I knew that was coming.  I knew that was coming.  This is how far they'd get into the tour before it broke up, too. 
[03:37:00]  That lead.  Fuck you, Eddie.  Hey, that's the V.A.  That's the Volkswagen riff.  That's the Volkswagen riff.  That's right.  Bill's ragging you. 
[03:37:30]  He really is, buddy.  Why don't you play some drums for us, Bill?  Yeah.  I want to see you out of breath after three seconds.  Oh, no, he didn't.  Oh, no, he didn't.  You shoot the hostage.  All right, there.  Car console.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Later, wheel.  All right.  We got maybe we do a guitar father.  Where's E-Rock? 
[03:38:00]  Where is E-Rock?  Is he taking an acting lesson, I hope?  He's trying to get anyone.  He's in pole.  Gentlemen.  No, you're too intimidating.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  He's in comedy.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  I guess he didn't hear his name.  I was doing it anyway live.  Ah, there he is.  E-Rock.  How you doing?  Where's his guitar father? 
[03:38:30]  Same place you keep your other child shirts.  Dresses like an infant.  Collared fairy.  Lottery cars for Led Zeppelin.  Something different than the stairway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tangerines coming in.  Grand Blanc.  It's an old fave.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  I don't like that patch.  I like this one better.  Who?  I like it.  Never a big Zeppelin fan.  Really?  No.  I was more a who guy than a Zeppelin guy.  And I know Jimmy doesn't like. 
[03:39:30]  I like.  Eh, who's okay.  My.  You ever watch Zeppelin live?  They are awful.  I'm sure there's nothing worse than a horrible live music.  Oh.  Wait, Led Zeppelin's awful live?  No.  They are horrible live.  What's wrong?  The vocals don't match up to the records?  They don't.  I can't hear a big phono.  What?  I really want to get into this. 
[03:40:00]  So what's wrong with seeing Zeppelin live?  The vocals don't match up to the records?  The energy's great, but they just suck.  They're amazing studio musicians.  They're a great studio.  Yeah, but just Robert Plant was never able to cut it.  Rage up the high notes.  No.  I saw like one live clip where he was able to do it, and then after that, it was done.  As a song remains the same, 1973.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After that.  But after that, it's forget it.  Gunscape.  It's really difficult.  But you know, they look like Led Zeppelin when you're seeing them live.  He still looks pretty good. 
[03:40:30]  He's still got the head of hair.  God bless.  Yeah.  Thank God for that.  Imagine a bald Robert Plant standing up there trying to sing.  Well, that'd be all right if he sounded like Robert Plant.  Looking like, well, yeah, bald, but with the hair on the sides.  Yeah.  Looking like Larry Fine.  You wouldn't mind at that point.  From the Three Stooges.  Hey, you need cooling.  Maybe I'm not fooling.  Looking like David Coverdell without his wig.  But you wouldn't mind at that point because you at least could close your eyes and you go,  oh, yeah, that's him.  Yeah, it's him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know. 
[03:41:00]  But he wouldn't sound like him.  I don't know.  Looks like.  How about the Stones or Alice in Chains?  Oh, those are easy.  What do you want to hear?  It's coming in.  Alice in Chains.  Go ahead.  Alice in Chains.  Alice in Chains, go.  Yeah.  Oh, look at all these patches.  There you go. 
[03:41:30]  You know that one.  Come on, man.  Just a verse.  I don't sing anymore.  A verse.  Here you do.  I don't get paid for it.  You sing so much.  You know what it costs to hire me these days?  I know you're a dick.  You ain't got it.  Actually, you need to get me in the early evening, late evening, after a few beers with  a karaoke machine.  We could catch.  Then I'll just fucking sing like an ass.  Catch you on Norwegian cruise lines. 
[03:42:00]  That's right.  On the cruise.  On the cruise, I'll be fucking singing like a bird.  Yeah.  You used to sing like birds.  When you were slaves.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  We should.  Found a way to kill me.  There he goes.  I was going to wind it a day and get out of here. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Sorry about my wind before.  I didn't mean for it to be so putrid.  Wind?  That wasn't wind.  That was a storm.  You even had the fake Bono hold on his nose, which is...  Dude, man, maybe you should not wear any more underwear.  Just wear a neck.  Obviously, it takes a lot for him to...  Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm stinking.  You got to leave the room.  I was blown out of the room.  Get behind me, Satan.  Someone's fine this morning, Jimmy.  Don't worry. 
[03:43:00]  There's a couple.  Yes.  All right.  Line of the day.  Two runner-ups.  Two runner-ups, and see, we did a show today.  Bodogfight.com sponsors Line of the Day.  Brother Joe will be playing underneath Line of the Days.  Why not?  Lines of the Days.  Wow.  I didn't sleep last night.  Give me a break.  Sweetie.  All right.  Here's the first runner-up Line of the Day.  Oh, I only bought about 5,500 shares of the stock. 
[03:43:30]  That's all.  I decided to get my bank account.  I thought it was a guarantee.  That's it.  It's a winner.  This horse is a winner.  There you go.  The first runner-up Line of the Day.  Bodogfight.com.  Thank you for sponsoring Line of the Day.  Here's the other runner-up Line of the Day.  When I was a boy, I had a pack of click-clacks I would carry in a little pouch.  Yeah, yeah.  I would never want to.  And she had the weird dream that this stranger was carrying this funny toy, this click-clacks 
[03:44:00]  in a pouch.  I used to have those as a kid.  They're a great toy.  Yeah, it is a great toy.  You can bang them together and make this weird noise.  Yeah, sure.  And she was dreaming about this man who had these weird click-clacks in this stupid carrying  pouch.  I was rubbing them on my face.  That is the oddest dream, man.  Oh, boy.  You really got it.  There's no lack of respect for me she has as a man.  Oh, it just really seems like...  Yeah, you're my man. 
[03:44:30]  I had a dream that a real man was washing your face with his balls.  Thanks a lot.  Fucking castrating half-jew.  Holy shit.  Here is today's Line of the Day.  Here comes...  The Line of the Day.  The Line of the Day.  The Line of the Day. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He's fighting A's and helping kids in Africa.  The Line of the Day.  I love you.  Yes, E-Rock.  Wow.  The Line of the Day.  E-Rock gets one.  I think that's the first E-Rock line of the day.  I do believe.  That's the first positive acknowledgement of anything he's done in two years.  Oh, please.  Two?  Life. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, and then he throws his head back.  It's all right.  I'll be in Poughkeepsie this weekend.  Poughkeepsie.  Friday, Saturday, bananas.  Yeah.  Bananas.  Tickets going like hotcakes right here.  I like bananas.  Brother Joe, the big plug.  Let's go.  We're going to be at the House of Blues in Atlantic City on March 10th.  Mini Kiss opening.  That's very cool.  www.notu2.com.  And once again, because we didn't hear it on Free FM, hello, Catherine.  But you're not the singer? 
[03:46:00]  Not this time.  No, eh?  No.  I just...  Yeah, we just hooked up.  You know, it's going to be Paul.  Paul Mahas from New Life Crisis.  He's one of the regulars.  And Brian DeVoe as well.  Not at the same gig.  Actually, because I have two bands, Brian is going to be up in Boston that weekend.  Do a Star Trek, like U2 thing, where an evil Bono, and you have the good Bono, and they  have to fight each other.  You know, someone's got to say it.  Looks like you might want to start a third.  Well, actually, what I'm going to do is I'm going to find out about having him go six weeks 
[03:46:30]  over to Japan to do the Legends show.  I have to talk to you about that afterwards.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Final Taps version.  Do your singers look as much like Bono as him?  No.  No.  So then why would you...  No, not many people.  Bono looks like that's about the next step up you can...  Well, then, dude...  But it's pretty cool he's going to do it in Japan.  Right.  Yeah, but how come you're not doing the big gigs like...  You speak Japanese?  Let's hear a little Japanese.  Bono is in Japanese.  Let's hear it.  My name is Bono. 
[03:47:00]  Bono is in Japanese.  That's why I always say, I want to express my love.  Open your mouth so I can shit.  I don't know what's happening in Japanese culture.  I only took two and a half years.  That was the third year of Japanese.  I just didn't make that class.  How about, let me bind your feet and wear a suit and not yell.  All of that was, I look like Bono. 
[03:47:30]  So, Joe, you guys will be talking maybe to set up this third band?  Yeah, you've got like two guys.  Why does it need like a...  Not a third band.  It'll be...  I actually have some work for him that I think he might be interested in.  And I'm pretty busy as well.  Yeah.  I'm doing a TV show coming up for ABC called The Next Best Thing.  Next Best Thing.  That's next week.  And then I do a lot of personal appearances that, you know...  Yeah.  And plus I splat it with a bunch of humanitarian work as well.  So the band thing is great, but it's like...  You really do? 
[03:48:00]  Humanitarian work.  A lot, man.  I spent the summer in Romania working with handicapped orphans as a volunteer and spent  all my student loan money building a playground.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I've done a lot of stuff.  Rebuilding homes in Missouri during the mid-90s.  This is before the whole Bono thing.  It's too bad you guys can't work something out.  With the look.  Well, you know, I've got...  Joe, you got the gig.  On a serious side, I was born in Yugoslavia.  I came out here as a kid and I've got this thing set up with some popular musician up there  and one of the ambassadors to have a U2 tribute thing set up.  To go throughout the country and create some sense of unity of some... 
[03:48:30]  Because, you know, music really binds people in such a way that they can't really explain  on a...  He talks like Bono.  He does, actually.  He even talks like Bono.  And so that's something that's on the...  Oh, I got a text message.  I have two full-time Bonos that fight over the work as it is.  Yeah, but this guy looks more like him.  But, uh...  www.notyoutube.com.  Go on.  You'll listen to the audio.  Look at the video.  It's all there, folks. 
[03:49:00]  I'm trying to get you to work, man.  Not to be confused with notgood.com.  I don't know.  If he can do six weeks in Japan, he'll be doing fine with the work.  Yeah, Japan.  He'll put you on Atlantic City, a little bunch of Vegas dates.  Why not?  You're in the States.  Nah, they pay too close attention.  That's a fuck-up, Jimmy.  Japan's a big gig.  Choke on your water, you slob.  Japan's a big gig for them.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'd be really good.  It is.  It's huge.  Nice people.  Let it...  See, you can go over there and talk Japanese.  Yeah.  I was going to say Japan.  Talk Japan is...  Yeah, that's good.  I'll leave a white flag. 
[03:49:30]  That's all they need to know.  One word in Japanese.  Bukkaki.  Yeah, that's all he knows.  That's all you need.  Oh, Jesus.  All you gotta do is giggle and act like you're five.  They'll love you.  Those fucking rotten, awful people.  All those cretins.  How they really are the worst.  Lose one world war and you gotta shit in your woman's mouth for the next century.  Oh, my God.  I'm going straight to hell.  How do you say yuck in Japanese?  Oh, God.  How do you say yuck in Japanese?  There you go something like...  Yeah, yeah, or...  Dama. 
[03:50:00]  Dama.  They're like...  Dama.  So...  Just like...  It's usually...  Yeah.  How do you say that?  That sounded like shit.  I think it's universal.  That was...  That was Japanese...  And he's seven.  I only made up to six, so...  It's too bad we don't have time to do one more song with you two.  Why don't we?  Well, um...  Ron and Fez...  Well, they went...  They got three minutes.  It's their first day back.  First day back.  Yeah, exactly.  They have plenty of time.  It's all...  Fez was sick for two days.  And they decided to come in early today and do an hour of radio. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  What song could you guys do real quick to take us out?  My acoustic guitar is broken, Jimmy.  All I have is electric.  Even though all those pedals down there, I can't make an acoustic guitar.  The acoustic guitar...  I ran out of battery.  I want to hear Sunday, buddy, Sunday.  Yeah, that would be a good one.  Why don't you sing it?  You want to sing it?  I might as well.  Hey, what?  What was the phone call?  Oh, this is my friend Heather.  I've stayed out here.  I came out with Maxim Magazine, and they're supposed to pick me up at the airport or hotel.  I got nothing.  So I go to the front of my ear. 
[03:51:00]  Let's slip in the house.  Are you bad again?  Are you banging, Heather?  No, no.  I'm not into that.  I've got good friends.  Friends of mine from church.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  From church?  Yeah.  This religious man.  Religious church.  I'm amazed he sat here this long listening to this drivel.  I've got five sisters.  I've got great respect for women.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Cool.  Are you looking at the antithesis of that?  I actually do respect women.  If I didn't, I wouldn't rape them.  Are you a good Catholic or an awful Catholic?  No, I'm a non-denominational.  I'm just a man of faith.  That's good.  That's all.  Nothing wrong with that.  No. 
[03:51:30]  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Play us some of that Quentin Tarantino beach music stuff.  I like the beginning.  I used to do this.  I've never played it.  Is this actually on the radio?  I used to do this at a fraternity house. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, you just hang out.  This time one guy that can play guitar, dude, someone.  Dude, play that.  Play that.  All right.  I used to sit there and play the leads to In Memory of Elizabeth Reed by the Allman Brothers  note for note to a room full of stoned kids when I was like 14.  And they would love it.  Where's Big Bono going?  Oh, I've got a...  Got a phone call.  What happened?  You've got to take this toward call.  You've got a...  Ah, right.  The president.  Yeah, best you don't take calls in here.  People like yelling out C-word.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't think of that.  He's going...  Jeez. 
[03:52:30]  He's a Bono...  Yeah, he's a Bono clone, so he's probably taking a call from some South American or some  African politician clone.  But it's like...  Yes.  It's the guy from...  It's the guy that looks just like the president of a country in Africa.  Joe.  So, hammering out people that look like starving Africans.  Yes, so...  You know we love you, so make sure it's perfectly clear...  Yes, talk to me.  ...about the U2 gig that you're doing.  Well, no, the U2 gigs that I do, we have two singers.  We have Paul Mahas and Brian DeVoe.  Which one is...  And neither one of them was here to me. 
[03:53:00]  Which one is...  No, you're just hanging out with him.  He's in New York.  Yeah, no, he's hanging out.  I've never met Pavel before today.  We actually...  Oh, I didn't know that.  We first met today.  Joe.  Absolutely.  Were you as surprised as we were?  Yes.  Okay, good.  How's the market doing?  Wow, the market has been open now for a while.  About what?  Is it going up or down?  I didn't know you guys just met.  Dow Jones.  I've never met him before.  Industrial Exchange.  How about?  You guys just met today?  Yeah.  Are we up?  Yeah.  I thought you guys were in a band together.  No.  No, we've been talking for about a year or so. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, just talking over the phone.  Talking for a year.  I'm sure in that time you sent tapes of you.  3.3% of it's value.  Yeah, probably a couple of samples.  Can we have a little bit more?  But you sent a bunch of stuff.  We've been talking about possibly doing some stuff.  But his schedule is such that there's no way.  The talking will continue.  No way he could.  All right.  Are you really that busy?  Yeah, pretty busy lately.  No way he could actually.  Can we hear a little bit more?  Is the Dow up 106 points?  Is that what I'm saying?  I believe so, yeah.  106, 107 points? 
[03:54:00]  It's the dead cat bounce.  See?  There you go.  I don't dislike him.  I want to hear Boardroom Jimmy talk about how the stocks have gone up now 106 points.  Sure.  See?  That's the bounce.  It would have been good to...  I thought we should end with a U2 song.  I agree.  We don't have time.  I'm sick of playing U2.  Actually, we're already into the bonus show.  Which one do you want to sing?  I love so many of them.  It's kind of hard.  We're into the bonus show.  Which one do you feel you sing well?  I sing a lot of them.  The bonus show. 
[03:54:30]  Want to do With or Without You or Desire?  With or Without You is what I know.  Let's do With or Without You.  I'm not a U2 fan.  You will be when you leave here today.  No, no, no.  But I mean, I know that one.  You've got to beat it out of you.  I know that song.  No, no.  With or Without You.  No, with or Without You.  Let's end on a high note.  We've been just slacking off for the last half hour here.  Got to end on an up note.  Give this up, right?  Yeah, I do.  I need that.  You need what?  Do you need headphones?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were going to say voiceovers.  I need those two. 
[03:55:00]  On a regular basis.  You know, I sing opera.  Oh, yeah.  I got accepted at Juilliard here.  Really?  About 10 years ago.  All right, let's hear a little opera.  All right, some opera.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a soprano.  Soprano.  No, I knew it was a little loose fitting for soprano. 
[03:55:30]  I'm a tenor.  Yeah, that was a tenor.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can tell.  Yeah.  Very good.  Oh, yeah, man.  Years ago.  Studying opera.  It's great.  No work.  With or without you.  Especially when you're straight.  I got a U2 song.  Let's hear it.  How about, um...  It's off my favorite album.  Favorite U2 album.  Let's hear it.  Unforgettable fire.  Brilliant.
