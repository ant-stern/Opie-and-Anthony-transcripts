<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an unplanned interview with Steven Backman, a toothpick sculptor whose scheduled appearance on the David Letterman Show had been cancelled.  The hosts, using highly offensive and sexually suggestive language, reacted with amusement to this news. They attempted to view Backman's artwork, shown via his website, including sculptures of the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, and a controversial piece depicting Biff Henderson.  Backman, under strict instructions from Letterman's staff, refused to show the Biff Henderson piece, leading to a heated exchange. Ralphie May was present in the studio during this segment.  Numerous interruptions from unknown callers further disrupted the interview.  The segment culminated in Backman's angry departure from the studio with his portfolio, resulting in a chaotic chase involving the hosts and staff. The hosts discussed the incident and the earlier, unrelated incident of mustard being thrown at someone outside, maintaining their characteristically irreverent style.

The show continued with a pre-planned prank involving a fake Bono. A man named Steve, who identified himself as a "power bottom" and boasted 40 million website hits in three months, left the studio for “fresh air” before participating in the prank.  Re-christened "Jimmy," he joined others in creating a convincing Bono look-alike to attract a crowd on 57th Street.  The hosts described the growing crowd, their reactions, and humorous interactions, including a man who threatened to expose the hoax, using extensive crude and offensive language throughout.  A musical guest performed a song and some opera during this segment, interspersed with further discussion and banter between the hosts.  The prank's success was discussed, and plans for future stunts were made.

The final segment involved a conversation about Guinness, punctuated by the hosts' signature raunchy humor.  "Fake Bono" (from the previous segment) discussed his Guinness-drinking preferences, including ideal temperature and head size.  The conversation was interrupted by the anticipation of Jimmy letting out a massive, graphically described fart.  The show concluded with goodbyes to the guests, including Fake Bono, and mentions of Catherine and Pavel, along with more crude jokes.

[00:01:30]  major news story he's a guy that makes toothpick sculptures true is that what it is yeah the guy  who uses tongue depressors bumped him wait a minute does seinfeld have another disc releasing this week  yeah did kramer go off on some chinese rant he's a chink  what are you chewing on oh that a boy oh no oh no oh shit oh no all right oh no the distinct 
[00:02:00]  pingy sound ping sound of a dodgeball how much money do i have on me today  i think this deserves a fist that's a camera we want a fist we want something that's a little  different than the usual what uh what type of sculpture is it does he have is it uh  the white house or was he gonna be up here soon where is he there was one on his card i guess it's  the only one we saw so where is he sort of a fabergé egg i think he's coming up from downstairs

[00:03:30]  because he does this he could be a marine corps sniper because one of the snipers uh training  i guess is is to make these things which would probably steady your hand uh working with little  toothpicks teaches you to exercise your breathing etc right oh i never knew that were you  a sniper sir yes sir oh okay we're looking at this guy i'm a working man were you ever in the  shit this guy uh doesn't look like he's a it looks like he's taking a two a few shots to the head

[00:09:30]  i was filming yeah and we did uh you know the rehearsal and everything was going fine and kind  of ran out of time oh it's okay nah being bumped from something like that you're so excited to be  there and everything you know but it's good experience and uh yeah every minute why didn't  they air your segment what happened uh they ran out of time what exactly is it that you do like  how did this come about how did you learn were you ever in the military like how did you learn  toothpick art no um basically what i did uh was i started creating a dna molecule out of beans and 
[00:10:00]  toothpicks in the second grade for a science project and then i got into uh cable cars and all sorts  of things but i could show you wow what i do here you uh that's cool oh you do do some some kind  of abstract that actually reminds me of when i was a kid and i set up my hot wheels track  into the little loop well this one's called sidetracked sidetracked yeah it's sort of like a  looping uh track thing made out of toothpicks right and uh how long would one of these take you they 
[00:10:30]  take weeks three weeks three to four weeks last uh march through may i had a solo exhibition in the  lobby of the empire state building really and i've got and you included we've seen your uh empire  state building on your website yeah you already checked that's very impressive how long did that take  oh that one took four months i'd imagine four months yeah everyone could see the artwork online  at toothpickart.com sure we'll we'll send a lot of people there today that's cool well why us  you heard about our show well actually um if i could tell you how it happened i met eric uh 
[00:11:00]  eric uh eric's been known to be sidetracked once or twice in real life he doesn't keep his private  life private eric and we know we you know it's that's all i met him at we love him dwayne reed  pharmacy across street i was making photos of me and biff uh-huh and uh he overheard me talking about  late show yeah hey my buddy that's his mo he's a ventriloquist i said oh okay yeah i said by the 
[00:11:30]  way i'm in town if you want have me come over i'll do your show that's how that's his line on guys  he's used that one over at dwayne reed plenty of time so feel flattered believe me that's all right  yeah so where's your art with you or no yeah oh oh oh what happened what what what oh no no no no  no video no video of your art why not of this piece because this is the one that was supposed  to air they said if i show it then i won't be able to get back on oh my god this is a biff that is a 
[00:12:00]  toothpick rendering of biff yeah out of uh 32 toothpicks and glue okay just 32 on the uh do you have any  wow that's cool yeah so this is just uh i use the needle nose pliers to bend the toothpicks did you  i use a straight edge razor blade to trim the ends and then i glue them down just with glue  do you do you use some kind of water to bend them no um believe it or not i actually crimp the  toothpicks and i get to the curve that i want a very smooth curve of his domed head would you say 
[00:12:30]  like i mean i mean i used to draw when i was a kid if you had to take to distinguish between that and  drawing i mean would you typically want to like is for you is it more of something that you would say  sketch or is it perhaps no um it's something because of that right now  i'm able to create so it looks like the actual rendering  um and that's the main thing  because dude you're holding up a toothpick of a guy's head  actually it looks a little like jimmy norton  exactly i know i heard it in the headphones 
[00:13:00]  put a toothpick on his nose  jimmy can you hold that up in the air for me so i can see it  i don't trust myself holding up  no toothpick on that's good so how long did that take you to do this one  usually takes between about eight nine hours eight and nine hours to do that right right and did he have to sit for you or do you have a picture i i worked off a photo a photo right and it's pretty accurate uh representation yeah it's got to be priceless at this point  well who knows yeah let me um but i've done one of like president bush 
[00:13:30]  no you did you did  yeah best put that away  do you have any with you  really yeah i mean i have  no i mean the actual things  uh no i actually  was here uh just for you know six days  just doing this letterman deal and then  wow  like i said before i had a show in the lobby of empire state building in lost more  through me i had all my work there  hey uh can i get a picture with biff  uh yeah  yeah we could do a little bit like that  uh jimmy could you hold up the picture of biff  well i mean  i want to get a picture  well if you don't mind we'll hold off on that for a moment  why 
[00:14:00]  i could explain why  they told me not to use any images of this if i want to get back on the show so  oh you don't want to  if i show the image then i won't be able to get back on the show  i hear you  you want to get back on the show  but what if it's a picture for my personal collection  well how about if we take a picture of something else that i have here  no because those are just pictures  oh  well  you know what  maybe i can make i got some toothpicks in the hotel room  maybe i can make you while i'm here  that'd be interesting  could you make sam like actual weight  yeah 
[00:14:30]  out of three toothpicks  why not  if you if you made  i want a picture with biff  how about we take a picture of opie  and you can make one of opie  and then you come back in  and then we can take pictures of that  i can't have a picture with biff  yeah unfortunately not  not a biff  but how about of me  no  oh  no  i want a picture with biff  well you know what  maybe we can work this out somehow  oh  and can you work it out  yeah  no i can't work anything out  how can you work it out  what am i the fucking uh diplomat 
[00:15:00]  what if i promise i wouldn't give the picture to the papers or anything  it won't be on our website  i can't do that  because they told me not to put the photograph on my website  so  we'll lay low on that right now  strict rules  yeah  well i don't feel like talking  oh  opie's hurt  don't be grumpy  don't be mr grumpy  hey but on on the  you interview this  yes sir  on a positive note  yeah  um  laugh  don't look at me 
[00:15:30]  i don't care  oh  he gets very  very very testy  if you give me a photo of yourself  no  i'll make the piece  i want a picture with biff  oh  okay  but what were you going to say about the um  uh  basically  everyone can again visit my art online  can they  yeah  i can create anything  out of toothpicks  i can create anything  anything  anything  that's great  if the price is right i'll do it  if the price is right  people actually pay  okay  now we're talking  these pieces range  like would you say that you go by the hour  or is it something that you charge 
[00:16:00]  by the size  or is it something that you charge by the difficulty  or is it something that you charge  um  it's a combination of all three  um  basically how long it takes  the subject matter  and really what is going to be used  for the piece of art  do you know beforehand  like say someone to commission something  yeah for example  i did one of lou dobbs  i did one of lou dobbs with cnn  um  i was commissioned by a new york executive  lou dobbs 
[00:16:30]  yeah lou dobbs  cnn yeah of course  how much would that empire state building go for  uh that's 25 000  25 000  wow  how many toothpicks are in there  uh 7 470  wow  let's do some math  that would be about  three thousand dollars a toothpick  mm-hmm  about  yeah  maybe who knows  yeah  well how's your math  can we see that band  help me  can we see the biff again  sure  yeah let's see the  three dollars a toothpick  yeah  three dollars times seven  stop screaming  i was saying three thousand dollars a toothpick  wow 
[00:17:00]  i'm an idiot  jimmy how does the biff feel  like you could feel like  oh i don't know  i wouldn't trust myself  yeah what do you use  what kind of glue do you use  uh just regular  elmer's  just yeah  okay  i'll give him a plug  just white glue  oh why not  elmer's glue  yeah  so this is  crafts  how do you keep it so  clean on that black background  i would spill glue all over the place  when i was a boy  i've been doing it a long long time  i think  have you  what you do is you put a very small amount  of glue in  and then you kind of smear it with your finger 
[00:17:30]  uh-huh  and that's  that's how it works  that's really  hold on two uh  seconds  okay  i just have to  take a call  that's okay  these guys are co-hosts  they know how to do this  thank you  where are you going at  um  out here  i don't  i'm not artistic  oh  when i was a boy i would  steven  i think it's funny that  steven seems pretty confused  why are you confused steven  uh  i'm not confused  i'm here i'm having a good old time 
[00:18:00]  yeah  how long have you been doing toothpick art  i've been doing toothpick art  for 35 years  oh my god  how old are you  you look young  40  you look much younger  oh so you started at 5  wow  i started when i was 5  wow  so just like crafts  like have you ever like  diverted into like  a macaroni stage  uh no  i usually  well people tell me you know stick with the toothpicks if you're if you're lucky with them and if you've been  yeah  if you got it right just keep on going with it  right right right  man  so do you guys have a project for me is there anything that you i mean maybe we could take out a steak and start popping it with toothpicks or something i actually do it i actually hold on um what do we got out there we got out there we got 
[00:18:30]  i'll be right back  um we got we want we want to get is how many can you get interns um how many people can you do on one paper like on one of these i mean i could do probably four or five i've done the early show from cbs there are five people how long would that take you takes a while like one two hold on two seconds two seconds two seconds one two three  i don't know man you know dude yeah i like it the uh the whole toothpick thing i do like it do you ever use other backgrounds besides just black uh no i just use black to kind of show the detail because if it were on like white you wouldn't be able to see it 
[00:19:00]  oh sorry sorry yeah so you wouldn't be able to see it if it was just on white right right oh man that stinks i know that's horrible  hmm did they leave you in the cold here or what yeah yeah this is the uh this is the torture i uh i'm curious 
[00:19:30]  so uh why did you pick biff uh because david letterman people do him all the time yeah and uh they thought  have you done david letterman i did david letterman you want to see him yeah yeah here we go of course is he  available on your website he's on my website oh so so you start in with dave i actually the first one i ever did  was of dave letterman picking his teeth with a toothpick and then from dave i got into like president 
[00:20:00]  bush and tiger woods barry bonds uh billy crystal and then i did one of biff because i wanted to get  on the show so i thought if i do one of biff might be a good way of getting on the late show with dave  letterman so not doing letterman wasn't enough to get you on right you had to bring in biff i had to  bring in biff  unbelievable yeah wow have you ever thought about doing leno uh i've thought about them but i've  never had a lot of toothpicks oh man to do the chin right i think it'll take quite a few 
[00:20:30]  so could you do one of anna nicole smith i can can you do one of her skinny and fat and then fatty  and then skinny again yeah i can then like uh uh dead again yeah whatever you want all right  that's good i think i'd like one of those yeah if i was going to commission guys if i was going to  commission uh a uh toothpick could you do one of a uh barack obama i could do one of yeah easy but  like like so it would just look like a puerto rican i don't think so i think i could get some good 
[00:21:00]  details out of him really uh-huh  ah this computer i would die why you're not going to commission one ralphie are you no he could do  if you could do five guys on one i don't know if i could take five guys me on one it might be too  much it's too busy yeah fuck that i don't think so oh no why so quiet yeah what's going on here  nobody's talking yeah i'm trying to get my computer to work no it's back here no the laptop 
[00:21:30]  adult you always have bothered that piece of  all right sure oh the laptop so uh what happened nothing what happened what did we miss i brought  the show to a screeching halt hey dude i was out finding guys i want i got him and him  and i want bill and i want we want five of the guys the under guys yeah 
[00:22:00]  so guys what's going on what happened to the biff  the biff was just he put it away he put it away he had it out the whole time  he just can't have it he gets mad can't have it well i don't i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want  that for how much would i sell them for i got a couple here you have more than one biff  yeah oh how much would you sell it for oh it depends how much it's worth you i actually don't 
[00:22:30]  know i mean i'm asking yeah i don't know these pieces are about two grand for uh two celebrities  are two grand and then for uh but like biff's not a celebrity oh that's pretty good yeah no wait  let's see what you get for two grand it's it's nice do you get like a letter of authenticity  that's pretty nice authentic what well it's obviously the guys i don't know what to ask 
[00:23:00]  about truth picard i i'm not artistic um it's like two grand a lot of money okay so let's let's make a  deal no no no it's not that i want to buy i don't know who biff is uh i've done one of george bush  um do you have that with you i have it on my website actually jimmy look at the biff and see  if you would you know pay two thousand dollars for that i'll what i like about the you can see where  he puts the little marks to make it bend that's pretty cool if you look close really yeah it has 
[00:23:30]  all the detail i mean picasso was good at that making like curves i know right see  you could have been a toothpick artist like uh can i see the curves on the real one i won't touch it  i don't want to touch it my hands i've been whacking my bag there it is wow how do you get  to bend dude turn around i use a needle nose pliers dude yeah i use a needle nose pliers and toothpicks  and every time i crimp the toothpick you'll see like a little don't you just break toothpicks left and  right oh uh no i use it basically i use a straight edge razor blade to trim the toothpicks 
[00:24:00]  and i use a needle nose pliers to bend them it's a lot harder than it actually looks by looking at  the piece it doesn't look like it takes a lot of time but actually definitely it's a lot do you  have to wet them first no i don't wet them i just need i just use the needle nose pliers if you crimp  them close enough i guess you get a nice smooth arc exactly yeah what does crimp mean crimp meaning to  like bend something to like pinch it but how do you pinch it with a razor i wish i had a toothpick 
[00:24:30]  here to show you oh that toothpick guy doesn't have a toothpick he's got some toothpicks and just  like how do you not have toothpicks hotel room so you have to travel with toothpicks yeah but um  like i said before i make these line drawings and they're they're very popular people love them  because they look they bring people happiness yeah and people can relate to them because they know  what they're looking at i mean maybe sometimes abstract oh we got toothpicks oh man good job now  open it up and show like where you would like make sure or something okay like show the picture 
[00:25:00]  how do you do crimping i don't know how to crimp you go like this i'm gonna pretend i'm crimping with  my pliers but i'm gonna use the you're using uh your nails let me try it with another toothpick i'm  gonna try crimping too hey maybe you know what you guys have given me a good idea maybe i'll get  away from the needle of those pliers and just use my fingers why not so here we go all right hold on 
[00:25:30]  how's mine mine hey you're hired yeah mine didn't come out too bad no mine's not doing you you're a  better crimper than i am see what you do is you kind of give it a but that doesn't look anything like  uh the biff i mean it'll look like the one i'm done sure i'm not a good crimper  see you just kind of i'm not a good crimper i made the i was trying to crimp it and it wasn't i  didn't look at mine uh no you're doing fine i made the gold i'm not very good at this yeah oh you're  great at that it's like i broke my right we're learning i made the golden gate bridge did you 
[00:26:00]  show yeah i mean you made the golden gate bridge it's 13 feet there was a very funny documentary  about that recently i know about people committing suicide did i laugh that was bad yeah it wasn't  the suicides that were funny it was like just the family reactions who keeps calling who keeps calling  you're a busy guy i know big in demand yeah i got a lot of calls who is that it's probably somebody  with gunk in their teeth they can't find anything to pick it out wait he's taking a phone call got a  piece of chicken can you send some art overs he's taking a phone call during our show sir 
[00:26:30]  we're on in two countries countries i need you  so here we are yeah all right so let's uh you married man uh no i'm single cool oh we can't  take pictures we're looking no unfortunately can't how about if you promise not to put on a website  i can't do that guys he wants to get back on the show yeah i want to get back on the show totally 
[00:27:00]  yeah i don't blame you for that tv baby tv yeah but you guys are hot i mean look i just came into  a great show how many biffs do you have huh how many biffs i have uh three biffs but all different  versions obviously because you didn't know what version they wanted for the uh the segment so yeah  right i'm smart oh i i actually created a larger piece uh the other one is smaller and then i  created one on like a paper do you when you when you create something do you ever just kind of say 
[00:27:30]  look like when you do like the abstract art or the other stuff do you ever say like i just kind of  want to create something but i'm not exactly like it's not you know like i i don't have like all right  this is a definable goal or right you know yeah well you know because of that yeah i mean sometimes  for example i used to make just cable cars for many years oh my god who is that you are a busy  man you're a busy busy artist i'll let it go i'll let it go yeah let it go yeah um basically i've

[00:38:00]  this yeah um simple installation that years ago i remember years ago doing something like this would  have taken five minutes it would have been there for the doing it would have gotten done and then it  would have been done with but now these days it takes forever well when two of your computers shut  down you know well and there's only one fucking computer running but that's the computer that's used 
[00:38:30]  for this kind of stuff the other two computers aren't really used for that they've never been  that reliable no just because that time has an awful virus doesn't you know obviously it can't that  one computer can't do everything those other computers have never been really good at certain  functions what the fuck i know they've always shut down i'm trying to update them trying to update  them but when you network the three together and one starts antagonizing the other yeah there's those  those other two computers have always been yeah computer problems or anything you use computers 
[00:39:00]  at all yeah i do you use computers for your art yeah i built the whole website myself oh you did yeah  oh okay you're you're a very talented he's mac or pc i did all the uh photography i do all the uh  news releases mac guy right mac no actually oh i don't like bio yeah really yeah well all right  that's something well just walking by good sync two computers this one's shot yeah this computer 
[00:39:30]  here the one right here that you're looking at obviously is shot obviously shot because uh i'm  gonna have to take it out of the studio if that other computer acts up yeah it's no good it's no good  then there's that one much lesser computer that kind of wants everything to work but it's scared  are you balls uh plenty of calls wow hello so jimmy why don't you take a look 
[00:40:00]  uh you have the wrong number who's that no problem what was he asking what frederico  man somebody got your number dude i mean ramon frederico yeah that's a lot of spanish people  here in new york spanish thing all right there's i like spanish almost there all right well uh 
[00:40:30]  see the one computer  it tries to network with the other one  yet it doesn't want to connect dude that's a problem that's been going on for years the one  computer is is completely ready and the other two computers just keep fucking it's the other one  yeah the other one's ready the other one's the other two can't network in  yeah so we also do a tech show oh yeah yeah yeah yeah they got two four let's get six  we're really good at the studio wow and uh can we just get a picture that's all i want obviously 
[00:41:00]  you could tell something's going on here i just want a picture with the with the biff you got it  right there huh no i want to be in the picture with biff oh like you're like you got your arm around  them or something well we were on letterman so when were you on letterman swear to god look it up  we could show you a video where can we show them the video of us i'm on in this it was great we were  on in uh december december no we no that was uh leno we were on leno as well you were on letterman  in august oh right there there you go weekday mornings our next guest can be heard on both cbs 
[00:41:30]  radio and xm satellite radio from the opian anthony show here's opian anthony that's the actual cue  card and then we we weren't bumped my friend brought out that's a shame i got you know what he  wants i know what he wants too because we did this um you know that uh uh thing that happened  in boston do it with the uh stupid light light up light bright looking things and they thought they  were bombs yeah we got one of those and we took pictures of it uh like it was a real person you 
[00:42:00]  know to celebrity pictures you put your arm around them kind of a thing and i know he takes pictures  with everybody he's like celebrity hound how about a picture of me and you so come on what about this  guy what about in between but he wants like the biff picture like it's a real person you me and biff  look i'm cleaning my hands and everything because i know how valuable what do you want the photo for  what's what's up to put on the website i think i think it's pretty cool i think me and you would be  after what about like if we don't put it up on the website until after like when will you know if 
[00:42:30]  you're going to be on i would think they would let me know within the next week or two because they're  going to probably fly me out again that'll be holding it a long time i know but but i have an  idea what's your idea my idea is to take out the portfolio and take pictures of us with the portfolio  yeah but we want the actual art and uh we did give you a lot of plugs on the show i mean i  appreciate pictures of a picture but you know i promised the guys i'd lay low with it until i get 
[00:43:00]  back on the air we know you put it online yeah but uh you know i mean that piece is actually a little  different than what i've got here oh oh what's different about it yeah it's a larger image of  it i created this one in all fairness in all fairness you can't really tell that  so when they're saying don't show it they probably because the size is something you  really can't tell on a picture they probably just don't want you doing another tv show  um yeah yeah i would assume well they said you know just lay low with it so that's why i promise i'd  lay low all right you guys understand i mean this is radio i mean we're we're using our voices 
[00:43:30]  they call it yeah i know it's a fun show though i'm very it is ridiculous isn't it i mean it's  great i mean i've never been in a room with like uh six guys talking on the radio it's just not  talking on the radio it's just six guys talking on the radio have you ever met a too thick artist  before that's no i have no without a cracker in the middle oh man so so overall what do you think of  the art i think it's pretty cool i think it's pretty damn cool it's uh yeah original thank you very much 
[00:44:00]  like that empire state building thank you i appreciate it all right something labor of  love all right ah labor of love it's like what we do here well i mean look someone has a full-time  job they like to make 50 grand a year and why not make money doing art all right yeah oh this damn  thing are you still having computer glitches constant oh many of your videos are opening what 
[00:44:30]  happened i'll talk a few videos all right all right should we thank steve for coming in or what  oh absolutely thank you very much for helping me on the show it's been an honor sir thank you so  much thank you and a continued success thank you and best of luck thank you so much why um  too big everybody go i'll say i'm just getting proud we're in break all right we're in break thank  you very much all right sorry but that was cool i was just i signed an agreement they say don't do it so  yeah it's all right yeah that happens was it okay for the herb so far yeah it was it was kind of 
[00:45:00]  boring to be honest with you yeah because we uh well not that it didn't suck or anything it wasn't  like that it was boring because you didn't we thought you had more pieces like we thought you had like  the empire stout i mean i was just in the pharmacy all i had was oh yeah yeah yeah no no no but you have  like i'd be more than happy to fly out with pieces i mean if you want it take care of the trip i'll  come out here i'll do whatever you want yeah anything yeah have me make pamela lee i'll do  anything you want pamela lee who's that pamela anderson oh pamela anderson nah she's not but 
[00:45:30]  i could do straight guys know she's not hot she used to be put me up to straight guys like whatever  line they fly out first yellow hue i know coach like that would be the person a gay guy would point  out as like someone that's hot oh yeah you know i know you saw something i get in a lot of trouble  like if i was gay and i wanted to make believe i'm not i'd go oh that pamela anderson is a hot broad  you know yeah that would be that that would be the example i would use just to throw off the scent 
[00:46:00]  in the room you know i've never heard a phone ring so much you're talking about your girlfriend  and can't yeah of course what are they asking for hello do it do it do it do it little who i it's  in a uh zipped up hunter bag no that's the reason i can't yeah people are wondering i need jimmy's  fucking help so anyway uh i have no idea i just think what happened steve he was asking me why his  phone is blowing up but i'm sitting next to you i have no idea that's a little weird hello
