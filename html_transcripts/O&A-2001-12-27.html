<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Don West's departure from Shop at Home, punctuated by playing clips of his outrageous sales pitches, including a fabricated one selling "22-year-old virgins."  This segued into a comedic bit where the hosts parodied West's sales style in various job interview scenarios.

The focus then shifted to their intern Rachel, highlighting the stark contrast between her hiring process (no formal interview) and the sexually charged interviews conducted by staff member Rick with both Rachel and another intern, John.  Audio clips of these interviews were played, followed by a segment featuring numerous callers sharing their opinions and experiences related to the situation.

Next, a phone call with 92-year-old former actor Buddy Epson was attempted, hampered by connection and hearing aid issues.  They discussed his new book, "Kelly's Quest," and played audio clips showcasing the deterioration of his voice over time, including comparing his pronunciation of "Well, Doggie" across different periods.  The conversation included anecdotes about his acting career and several inappropriate comments, particularly a discussion of a female co-star being a “carpet muncher.”  This was followed by a caller requesting anal sex advice, which spiraled into a comedic discussion with multiple callers offering increasingly absurd suggestions.

This anal sex advice segment continued into the next part of the show, featuring increasingly vulgar and humorous caller suggestions, with the hosts utilizing graphic sexual language and food-based metaphors.  The show then abruptly transitioned to a discussion of Natalie Cole's revelation about sex work, provoking a mix of shock, humor, and crude commentary from the hosts and callers.

A significant portion of the show focused on a planned blind boxing match between Blind Dave and Blind Matt, both in the studio.  BattleBots announcer Bill Dwyer called in.  The segment included humorous interactions with the blind boxers, such as Blind Matt removing his prosthetic eye, and a discussion about Blind Dave's driver's license.  Despite the hosts expressing discomfort with the event, preparations for the blind boxing match continued, highlighting the tension between the show's shock humor and potential for harm.  A brief mention of a separate incident involving a woman with Tourette's Syndrome on a train was also included.

The blind boxing match, held outside the studio, constituted a major portion of the show.  The chaotic fight involved near-misses with bystanders, unintentional punches landing on crew members, and much flailing.  Ben judged the match, which utilized a three-knockdown rule and a ten-point must system.  The hosts provided commentary throughout the unpredictable and hilarious event,  with one intern reportedly being knocked from their chair during the three-round match. The boxers consumed Jack Daniels between rounds.  The hosts initially scored the match a draw in the third round but later announced Matt as the winner by unanimous decision.  Post-match, Dave was visibly exhausted and emotional, while Matt gave a thankful and celebratory speech, including repeated thanks to God and shout-outs to various individuals and sponsors.  The show concluded with a comedic phone call segment featuring Bill Wisnoski, whose repeated attempts to obtain hearing aid information were hindered by his own hearing difficulties, leading to humorous interactions with a show employee named Missy.

I don't shut up.  I'm not afraid of a couple of digits intruding my rear door.  I'm not afraid of all men.  I'm dead lit.  Be probing.  Be probing, ladies.  Holy cow, that's funny. 
[00:09:30]  What the hell he's going to do?  He's got to figure it out.  Hey, guys, too.  Call up.  You can F my face.  F my face.  You can slam it like McGuire's bat.  And I'll give you McGuire rookie card.  I can slide it through my butt cheeks like an ATM.  Get the map of Hawaii all over me.  I got a pretty little mouth. 
[00:10:00]  I got a pretty little mouth.  And I'm not afraid to use it.  Not afraid of easy.  And then, guys, I swallow.  Not afraid of.  I swallow.  I swallow.  I swallow.  Fabio, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, if this guy's really down on his luck,  he could always give himself a little stable of bitches  and be that pimp and really stuff. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, he'd make a good pimp.  We got them all.  We got blacks, chicks, spics.  We got all kinds of ladies.  Oh, I hope Don Imus doesn't fire me.  We're using racial evidence.  But I got hoes up the air.  I'll miss that guy.  Oh, my God.  He'll pop up somewhere else.  That was funny, Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  027 WNEW.  Woman, I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide.  I cry when the angels deserve to die.  I cry when the angels deserve to die.  I cry when the angels deserve to die. 
[00:11:30]  Why aren't they searching Gary Cohn in his apartment two months too late?  Well, because he's not a suspect.  You would have thought they would have, you know,  tried to search him a little sooner than this.  People have to realize there has been no crime.  There's no crime here.  It's a missing person. 
[00:12:00]  If they want to search his place, which he gave consent to do,  I think the guy's innocent of anything.  Oh, my China, kid.  The guy gives me the creeps.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a missing intern.  I wish a few of our own would go missing.  But, yeah, the missing intern.  What, you have a problem with some of our interns, Ed?  No, you know me.  You know that we purposely don't have female interns on our show? 
[00:12:30]  Why?  Well, we sacrifice for a listener so we can, you know, do our jobs.  We have one.  We have one.  That snuck through the cracks.  That's true.  That didn't go through the proper channels.  That was funny.  Very pretty girl.  Rachel.  Beautiful.  Rachel.  And Rick comes in one day and goes,  Hey, I want you to meet the new intern.  Now, usually when we have interns that are prospects for the show,  they're brought into the office.  We meet them.  And then they have a little interview with Rick and whoever.  They go through a whole process.  They have to talk to Rick and Ben. 
[00:13:00]  Then they have to talk to Jeremy, the program director here,  and Craig, the assistant.  There's a whole process.  And then after a while, if they cut the mustard there,  they get brought in and it's like,  Hey, here's our new intern.  Right.  With Rachel, Rick brings her in and just goes,  Hey, here's our new intern.  Like there was no process of anything.  Nothing.  And it was the first time we saw her.  It was the first time we saw her.  Right.  Hey, new intern.  Oh, what the hell is going on here?  And then we just go, okay.  We were happy, but we were happy, but pissed at the same time. 
[00:13:30]  Well, it's very distracting when there's, you know,  hot women walking around when we're trying to broadcast.  That's all right.  See, we sacrifice.  Yeah.  We know we can't do our jobs if the women are around and they're looking all good and stuff.  Dan says they should search Gary Ackerman's office while they're at it.  I just have a feeling.  That's true.  We get a lot of calls from Gary Ackerman, who's a congressman out on Long Island.  And he sounds very, very with it. 
[00:14:00]  You know, he likes the show and everything.  And then we looked at a picture of him.  The guy is, he's an old guy.  He's no kid.  No, not at all.  But he's got a great sense of humor, I guess.  Very surprised that he listens to our show.  But, yes, search the apartment.  What?  Rick?  Rachel.  What about our...  Rachel never went through...  Our intern.  Rachel never went through the process.  Never went through the channels.  Why, Rick?  Why, Rick?  Let's listen to this load of crap.  Let's hear this.  We've been a bit needy. 
[00:14:30]  Hold on.  Here is why.  Hold on.  We've been trying to get to the bottom of this for a long time, man.  Filthy whore.  Because you should see...  Here is why.  You should see what these poor interns have to go through just to work for free and get  our stupid coffee.  It's kind of pathetic.  But this girl just marches in and she's great and all.  Get the hell off my obstacle!  That's like what the interns usually have to go through.  Private Pyle, you're a disgusting fat body!  She's great.  She belongs here and she's intelligent and all that.  But I just know she did not go through the process. 
[00:15:00]  Actually, she did.  She went through the meetings.  But that day, you guys...  What meeting?  No!  The closed door!  Wait, hold on!  Yes, yes, yes!  Hold on!  Here we go!  I'm trying again.  I'm telling you!  Why is Stinky shaking his head?  And why is Ben shaking his head?  I remember going into Air 2 to edit some bits or whatever.  And you're in there talking to her by yourself.  And I go back to Ben.  I'm like, how come Rick's in there talking to some girl?  Because you guys had the doors closed for something wrong. 
[00:15:30]  I'm going to get down to edit a piece.  Hold on.  Congressman Rick.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Congressman Rick.  Check his Miata.  Here's the interview process for Rick.  I just want to ask one question.  Okay.  And I'm going to ask it to Ben, okay?  Ben, how many of the interns currently on staff were you involved in the interview process? 
[00:16:00]  Everyone but Rachel.  Right.  Exactly.  You know that's true.  You know that's true.  But like I said, Craig...  And why do we ever meet her?  Craig finds me.  He says, hey, I've got that intern, blah, blah, blah, for the meeting today.  I'm like, where are the other guys?  Oh, the door is closed.  Opi wanted the door closed.  Whatever.  I'm like, fine.  Send whoever it is down.  I've got to edit a bit.  No problem.  I'll just talk to them there. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, because you were editing a bit.  So you figured you'd save time by editing the bit in the private studio while you conducted the interview.  So when did you introduce her to Ben and Stinky?  I don't remember.  Maybe it was the same time we were introduced to her in the office.  No, I think you guys saw her.  What would happen, Rick, if you brought some guy that was going to be an intern into our office and just went, hey, this is the new intern?  We'd be like, what?  We never met him.  You guys met her afterwards, right?  Afterwards.  No, no, no.  Not with you. 
[00:17:00]  After you got finished?  I'm talking.  You guys met her after I spoke with her, right?  You met her that day after the door opened, right?  On her way out?  I don't really.  I just remember going in there and seeing you in the studio by yourself.  There was a mic on during the interview process.  Oh, really?  We have Rick.  Do I make you hoony?  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Really? 
[00:17:30]  I have some audio.  Oh, because the mic was on.  Here's Rick talking to the intern, right?  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  That is not what happened.  We have more?  All right, here's Rick in the interview process.  Do you like having your background?  No, that didn't happen either.  Pusser!  No? 
[00:18:00]  Shut up, stinky, you ass.  Here's the intern, Rachel, after the interview process.  You've got some funky-tasting spots.  Oh, my God!  Is it true?  Rick was second-guessing himself after she left.  This is legal, isn't it?  Wow.  More of Rick.  Take your balls and kick it off now! 
[00:18:30]  And here's the intern then leaving, Rachel leaving the office.  We're cakes for nothing!  Here's Rick to Rachel.  Don't just stare at it, Peter.  Oh, no.  That's horrible.  That is not what happened.  Is it?  No!  There was a reason why we couldn't...  I couldn't do the interview in the office with the guys. 
[00:19:00]  It was because you guys were in there, and you're like,  all these interviews, we don't want to be a part of them.  You guys just deal with it.  All right?  You got some more Rick?  Yeah.  Oh, you're very naughty.  No, this is Rick.  We've got Bush.  We've got Bush.  Is it true it was that time?  Because why else would Rick say this?  Pull the sink!  Pull the sink!  I don't know.  It was just a very normal intern. 
[00:19:30]  Is that on in the background?  No, it was Rachel.  I'm pointing out something to Rick that's a little hot during the interview.  Your balls are showing.  What's your basic intern meeting?  Can I touch it?  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  All right, Rick. 
[00:20:00]  Well, we got audio.  Now we see.  It doesn't really matter, you know, how we got her.  She's a good intern.  Yeah.  She's a great intern.  Very.  It's in the hole!  All right.  Well, Rick.  I'd say your legs come back.  Is it over yet?  Yes.  Doug, what's up? 
[00:20:30]  I heard during Rachel's interview, Rick says, you don't worry about doing the A, Bs, or Cs.  Just do the Ds.  Later, guys.  Hey, that's good.  That's a good callback right there.  It's actually the Cs.  Now, as a little contrast, we also have audio of Rick's interview with John, the intern.  Okay.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  See, there's a little difference there.  Well, here's Rick with Rachel.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you? 
[00:21:00]  Just don't talk that way with people that you want working for you.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  It's very inappropriate the way you were dressed when she first walked in.  Hello, cutie pie.  Now we're having fun.  Yeah, we sure are.  If I said you had a beautiful body, would you take your pants off and dance around a little? 
[00:21:30]  Here's Rachel.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  You're close.  Give them to me.  Now.  Wow, this is going to be a great callback line.  Paul, what's up?  What's up?  Rick, did you offer a drink?  You know, coffee, tea, or me?  Yes.  Nice.  Bravo to Paul.  Shut up!  Dick! 
[00:22:00]  All right, great.  Why would you ask this, Rick?  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.  I don't know.  And when she was taken aback at some of your sexual advances, why'd you have to say this?  Well, we're waiting.  My God, Rick.  All right.  I don't know if Rachel's qualified for the job, Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  I got a little audio of Rachel after, you know, Rick was through it.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  Did you hire her for her body?  Flaming Arrow checking in saying, please search Rick's apartment.  And Sheep Lover is saying that we shouldn't blame Rick because it was Max.  That's the fact.  It was Rick's alter ego, Mad Max.  Even a better callback.  You douchebag.  All right.  Liz, what's up? 
[00:23:00]  I'm so hung up on these girls over here.  Oh, the teen fake-os?  You have an idea.  On my way to work, I fully missed my exit.  I have to go home and change my pants because I am dripping.  And she went through a puddle, I guess, and the water came in through the window open.  And now she's wet.  It's happened.  It happens.  And between the girls on the radio and me in tandem, it's like a stereo over here for  anyone who's interested in listening.  Wow.  So I just wanted to say thanks. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  We do have other intern openings coming up.  Yeah.  Yeah, Liz, would you like to take a meeting?  Intern with the Oprah Anthony show?  I don't know.  I've heard the interviews are pretty tough.  I hope I can hack it.  Hell, let's be like Gary Condon and just wreck our careers.  Why not?  Let's just get hot interns.  All right, I'll be there.  Don't get too attached.  We'll make you disappear.  All right, Liz.  Thanks, bye.  By the way, someone needs to say it.  That girl is not hot.  Who that?  The missing intern. 
[00:24:00]  They call her the hot intern.  The New York Post always says the attractive young intern.  Attractive young intern.  Well, the Post tags somebody with something and then just leaves it that way.  Like the other one, the girl, the flight attendant he was with, is the flame-haired stewardess.  Right.  And now she's just referred to as that.  The flame-haired stewardess.  She looks like Miranda from Sex and the City 20 years from now.  Ah!  Look at me with a little Sex and the City line.  I know.  There'll be 20 things going.  Sex and the City? 
[00:24:30]  Fag.  Fag it.  Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day we do blind boxing.  Blind boxing, part of the cripple bouts.  Cripple bouts that we're doing here on the show.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Uh, 877-692-1027.  When we get back, Anthony, we're going to talk to the blind guys.  They're here, right?  Yeah.  Great.  Very cool.  We've just got to get them from upstairs.  It's blind David and blind Matt. 
[00:25:00]  We'll be back with the blind guys to set up blind boxing today on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-W-A-W.  It's O&A.  Anthony, very excited.  I know.  He's a friend of the show.  We haven't talked to him in a couple of years.  It's been a while. 
[00:25:30]  It's the legendary Buddy Epson.  Who I believe is 92 years old now, Anthony.  All right.  Let's say hi to Buddy.  Buddy!  Yeah, yeah.  Buddy Epson.  Hello?  How are you doing, Buddy?  Hello, this is Opie or Anthony?  Both.  Both of us, sir.  Opie and Anthony on the phone at the same time.  Oh, at the same time.  At the same phone?  How about that technology?  Oh, that's really getting close.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Now, Buddy, we haven't talked to you in a couple of years.  It's great to see, well, you're still around. 
[00:26:00]  That's good.  I'm not only around, but I'm still, you know, doing things.  Like, you know, creating something.  I see that.  Last time we talked to you, you were painting.  You're still doing the painting?  Painting?  Yeah.  Are you?  I feel like I'm not fully connected here.  Yeah, I'm getting that, too.  Are you getting a full voice? 
[00:26:30]  Oh, the sound?  Yes.  How's this?  Is this better, Buddy?  That's a little better, but it seems to cut out when I talk.  How's this, Buddy?  Is that better?  Yeah.  Let me try another hearing aid.  I've got it here like...  Yeah, pop another hearing aid in.  Talk to each other for a moment.  All right, pop another hearing aid in, Buddy.  Opie, Buddy...  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  There we go.  Opie, Buddy's going to try another hearing aid. 
[00:27:00]  Buddy's going to pop in another hearing aid and tell us all about what he's working on.  All right, a minute.  What's that?  Buddy?  Buddy?  He's just...  He's still...  I think he said it'll be another minute.  Hello?  Buddy!  You're there?  Yeah.  That's what happens when, you know, when you're 92, you know, you have to...  Things happen to you like when you see a pretty girl walking by and your pacemaker starts to open the garage door and then, you know, things happen. 
[00:27:30]  Buddy, how many electronics do you have on you?  Any electronics?  Yeah.  What do you got, the hearing aid?  You got a pacemaker?  A pacemaker and a hearing aid.  But I...  You're not cutting out now.  That's not too bad.  Last time we talked to Buddy Epson, he was entering the Internet.  Yes, you had the BuddyEpson.com website.  Oh, yeah.  Well, now we're selling a book on BuddyEpson.com and also on...  Let's see. 
[00:28:00]  First Books.  Yeah.  First Books.  BuddyEpson.com.  Okay.  And also the Barnes & Noble, which is a bricks and mortar bookstore.  Buddy remembers when the wagon used to come around with the books.  The wagon used to come around with the books.  I don't quite remember.  I wasn't in the book business in those days.  Hey, Buddy, what's the name of your book?  Kelly's Quest.  You know, it's a very strange thing.  It happened. 
[00:28:30]  I mean, I was in show business for 75 years.  Yes.  I thought I was just, you know, entertaining folks.  But I didn't realize I was gathering material for a novel.  Yeah, you had enough material for a novel.  Sure.  That's kind of...  It happened.  One day I was inspired.  I worked on a set of Barby Jones, and it was very busy as usual.  And there were a bunch of very efficient crew.  And among them, there was one girl.  One girl. 
[00:29:00]  And she was beautiful.  But she was a stagehand.  I mean, she had done the reeds and the tool belt.  And she was doing her job in such a way that nobody could find fault with her.  Yeah.  And she fascinated me.  And so I wrote a novel about her.  You were all, like, hot on this girl.  Well, I was just curious.  You were, like, a kid of 65 back then, too, right?  Buddy?  It's difficult to convince my wife that I didn't have a romantic kid. 
[00:29:30]  A threesome.  Hey, buddy, buddy.  Huh?  Did you want to, you know, have some of that sex with this Kelly girl?  Well, yeah, secondarily.  First of all, I was interested in her life.  In her life?  Okay.  Yeah.  And so I put together the rest of her story.  Yeah.  And it turned out to be Kelly's question.  What she is, is looking for a man. 
[00:30:00]  She's looking for Mr. Wright.  You know who Mr. Wright is?  Oh.  He's, whatever girl's looking for, a guy that she would, you know, like her to be the  father of her children.  Now, buddy.  Yeah.  Did that young whippersnapper that played Jedediah Jones?  I don't know what happened to him.  Did he get Kelly?  No.  He disappeared.  He sure did.  He's off the scope.  I don't know what happened to him. 
[00:30:30]  He has no forwarding address.  Goddamn, that was a great show.  He disappeared.  Barnaby Jones.  Yeah, can we get a Barnaby Jones line out of you there, buddy?  The what?  Can you say something from Barnaby Jones for us?  Something from Barnaby Jones.  Yeah, we like when you recite some dialogue from the old show there.  Good evening, ma'am.  My name is Barnaby Jones.  I understand yours, but went out to buy the evening paper one night ten years ago, and  you want me to find him?  Because his supper's getting cold.  Is that enough? 
[00:31:00]  That's enough, buddy.  But you know something?  You know what I want to hear?  Now, this is obviously from the classic show, the Beverly Hillbillies, which everyone has  just grown to love you from.  And I got to hear your famous line.  Here it comes up.  Noel Doggy.  Yeah, you want to hear that?  Yeah, let's hear it.  That's two words.  It certainly is.  You ready?  Yeah.  Well, Doggy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[00:31:30]  There you go.  Buddy.  You know, everyone's been waiting for that, buddy.  The what?  Everyone's been waiting to hear you do the Well Doggy.  Well, I'll tell you what I'm thinking of doing.  I'm thinking of putting it on a watch.  On a watch?  And then, like, every hour it'll go Well Doggy?  You think it would go well?  Hey, you didn't pop a vocal cord, did you?  I didn't.  No, but my voice is a little off today.  Oh, yeah?  Well, you're busy now.  You got a book out, and you're doing a lot of press for the book.  Sure.  You're talking a lot. 
[00:32:00]  I'm really talking too much.  Hey, can we hear the Well Doggy one more time?  Yeah, I want to talk about it.  One more time.  If you hear it too much, I'll get tired of it.  No, no.  I've been hearing that since I was a kid.  All right.  Hey, this isn't the last time for Well Doggies, but it's two of you there, and this is one  for each one.  All right.  Here we go.  Well Doggies.  Yeah.  Okay.  Funny.  Funny.  This is such fun the second time, so I will only do it once. 
[00:32:30]  No, I think that was better than the first one.  Hey, buddy, we're hearing that you have, like, a song parody.  You do a little something to the Beverly Hillbillies theme?  Something from the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  Let me see.  Supposedly he has reworked the song.  Oh, really?  You kind of rewrote some of the words or something?  Oh.  Come and listen to the story about a man named J.  The poor mountaineer.  Barely kept his family fed. 
[00:33:00]  And then one day, oh, he never...  When I...  I'm still writing it.  When people...  I'm sorry.  You shouldn't have asked me, but that was too tough.  Yeah.  No, we got...  That's okay.  That's all right.  We were...  What the hell?  We were told that you had...  You worked up a little ditty.  Now, buddy.  Yeah.  You remember Miss Hathaway from the... 
[00:33:30]  Miss Hathaway?  Yeah.  I remember.  Now, was she...  Wonderful, wonderful actress.  Yeah, she was.  Of course.  She was in a lot of things back in the 60s and the 70s and whatnot.  Now, was she...  You know...  You know what I mean, right?  I don't know what you mean.  You know what I mean.  Was she...  Did she like some of the...  Did she like Kelly also?  Would she have liked Kelly?  Uh...  Well, I think they would have gotten along.  Yeah, huh?  But, uh... 
[00:34:00]  I wouldn't say that, uh...  I think she was a dyke, buddy.  They were not...  They were not similar personalities, I would say.  I'm guessing Miss Hathaway, carpet muncher.  You know what I mean?  She what?  I'm thinking she was a carpet muncher.  You know what that is, buddy?  A carpet muncher?  A carpet muncher.  A vegetarian.  You know what I mean?  You know, kind of into the girls.  I don't know.  You're speaking another language.  Oh, yeah.  You know, kind of like into girls more than guys. 
[00:34:30]  You know?  She's like digging for the pearl.  I never investigated that possibility, but...  She was a nice lady, and she liked it well, and that's all that...  That, uh...  You know, that's as far as I went in investigating.  Ah, you talked to Max at all?  Max, of course.  What do you mean I've talked to him?  I say, hello, Max, and I shut up for 20 minutes,  because he keeps coming.  He doesn't shut up, huh?  You know, he's a wonderful guy.  Jethro.  I should never have given him a set of dominoes for Christmas. 
[00:35:00]  Dominoes?  Yeah, he just saw them in a half-sitted roll,  and look what happened.  He's building some kind of a gambling casino.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  A Jethro gambling casino?  Yeah.  Uncle Jed, Uncle Jed, I'm going to make me a casino!  I can see it.  It sounds like one of his little schemes that he was always trying to do.  I'm going to be a double-naught spy!  That's one of my favorites.  Yeah, I can see you're fans of his, and properly, so he's a wonderful guy.  Well, let me tell you, a big fan of the Beverly Hillbillers. 
[00:35:30]  I always enjoyed that.  And now you're a novelist, which, you know, 92 years old...  And it depends on how many people buy the book.  So I want you guys to get busy and plug it, please.  I'm going to go out on the street with a cart and sell it myself, buddy.  Stay right on the machine there.  The machine.  You can get Buddy's book through his website, buddyepson.com.  Is there anything else on the website, Buddy?  I don't know.  You might find some other stuff on there.  But I'll...  Any of that... 
[00:36:00]  The book is the thing that I want to plug right now.  All right.  And there's none of that porno on your website?  There's no porno on there.  Yeah, that's a lot.  Porno is a thing of the past.  You have to get to the real story now.  And I got to tell his question.  All right.  Very good.  Buddy Epson, thank you so much for coming on the air with us again.  You're very welcome, and I enjoyed it.  Thank you.  And we look forward to talking to you again.  Thanks.  Thank you, buddy.  Anytime.  Thanks, buddy.  Right.  Bye.  All right.  The great Buddy Epson. 
[00:36:30]  There goes Buddy Epson.  He's a novelist.  Go to BuddyEpson.com.  Oh, my God.  You know, I thought last time we talked to him was a little, you know, rough.  Well, now we've got to compare.  Well, Rick, can you, Rick, please get those two.  Also, isolate the clip of him saying Carpet Muncher because that is Carpet Muncher.  When he said that, I got a Carpet Muncher.  He goes, Carpet Muncher.  What is it, Carpet Muncher?  I think we found a new sound. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, Carpet Muncher.  Yeah.  Poor Buddy.  Well, you know something?  If you could even do that at 92.  God bless us.  And write a book and whatnot.  God bless us.  What not.  Definitely.  Him trying to sing the song.  How uncomfortable was everybody?  It was Chris Radio at his best.  I was trying to shut up, but then when it got silent, I had to jump in and say something.  I was like, well, I'm really uncomfortable here, buddy.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's going on? 
[00:37:30]  Congratulations, boys.  I'm getting the last interview with Buddy Everton.  No.  Stop it.  I'm having to hang up on Pete.  Stop it.  That's not nice.  Come on, Pete.  He's fine.  We said that last time, and that was two years ago.  He's still kicking.  Jay, what's going on?  Guys, you guys got to be careful.  I think that's considered elder abuse.  I'm not too sure.  We were very nice to Buddy Everton.  Well, you know, and Buddy's publicist told us that he sings a good version of the theme song.  I don't know who the publicist was thinking about.  Maybe back in 1974. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know why.  The guy specifically wrote it in a note when he sent the book over.  He says, hey, Buddy has this great parody that he does to Beverly Hillbillies.  Have him sing it.  He does it all the time.  He's listening to Janet for her.  Well, they drink it.  He wants to get like two and a half lines out, and he goes, I'm still writing it.  Other part of that is the thing, and then he's listening to us.  Well, I wish he didn't ask you that.  Poor Buddy.  We leave you with the sounds of Buddy Epson. 
[00:38:30]  Buddy used to be very healthy and vibrant.  Heard his voice.  Sounded just like it did on the Beverly Hillbillies.  Now it sounds like a combination of a modem and tires squealing on a road.  Wow, that's close.  Yeah, it's really, really deteriorated the poor gang.  All right, Anthony, why don't we start with Buddy Epson saying carpet muncher.  Ah, all right.  Here it is. 
[00:39:00]  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  Wait, can I have some Sandy Kane sounds?  Did you ever think you'd hear Buddy Epson say carpet muncher?  That's the weird things that I like.  Yeah, I love this show.  I smell bit.  Eh, eh, eh.  I smell a Sandy Kane Buddy Epson remix.  Oh!  A carpet muncher.  Eh, eh, eh.  A carpet muncher. 
[00:39:30]  Ow!  A carpet muncher.  I don't blame it.  A carpet muncher.  Oh!  Oh!  All right, that's carpet muncher.  You got me, man.  Here's Buddy Epson doing a famous line from Barnaby Jones.  Good evening, ma'am.  My name is Barnaby Jones.  I understand your husband went out to buy the evening paper one night ten years ago,  and you want me to find him because his supper's getting cold.  I don't remember that episode.  Good evening, ma'am.  It's Barnaby Jones. 
[00:40:00]  He was old then.  Remember you used to say, wow, look at Barnaby Jones.  He's like the geriatric gumshoe, you know.  He's just kind of walking around.  He's an old guy.  And that was back in, I think, 74.  I was going to say, like 75.  25 years ago.  It's Barnaby Jones.  Hello, ma'am.  Your husband left.  Oh, wait.  I'm your husband?  Let me get my hearing aid.  A different one.  Here's one that is just tragic, buddy.  I'm interested in trying to sing the Beverly Hillbillies theme song.  There's more of this, though, right?  Yeah, we're going to add to it.  But Rick was running real fast to get this done while we were in commercials. 
[00:40:30]  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer,  barely kept his family fed.  And then one day, but he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  The horror of getting old. 
[00:41:00]  And people say, well, I saw Jeannie in the room, and then you came back, and I don't know  where she went, and it was there.  But now Major Nelson, it's gone.  It sounds, a lot of people are saying it sounds like Buddy said, crumpet muncher.  Oh, yeah, that's what the phone call's about?  Yeah, Jay.  I was reading feedback.  It's all right.  Hey, Jay.  Yeah.  Hey.  Sounds like crumpet muncher to me.  Yeah.  Sounds like an English guy or something.  Crumpet muncher?  All right, let's see that, yeah.  A crumpet muncher? 
[00:41:30]  A crumpet muncher?  A crumpet muncher?  It does sound like crumpet muncher.  A crumpet muncher?  What was that?  A crumpet muncher?  That's even better.  I'm just going to call Dykes crumpet munchers now.  They're not going to know what the hell I mean.  Who's running to opf3.com to steal that screen name?  I'm crumpet muncher.  I'm crumpet muncher.  A crumpet muncher?  Maybe the girls he's been with lately.  A crumpet muncher?  Jose, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Yeah, I was going to say, when he says I'm sorry, he sounds so dejected, like, so defeated. 
[00:42:00]  I got to hear it now.  I got to hear it now.  We got to add to this, because then there's a line where he goes,  Maybe you shouldn't have asked me that one.  Maybe you shouldn't have asked me that one.  Talk amongst yourselves.  Let me try another hearing aid.  All right, here's the song again.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer,  barely kept his family fed. 
[00:42:30]  And then one day, oh, he, but he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Oh, don't laugh at that.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened, Bill?  I was just talking.  Some guy put Buddy Epson's info into deathclock.com, 
[00:43:00]  and it came up, he should have been dead November 3rd, 92.  They're laughing out there.  That's not funny.  And you hear in the middle, he's like,  I'm still writing it.  He said, I'm still writing it.  All right, let's compare the well doggies.  All right.  This is a very popular feature on our show.  We've been doing this for years.  Okay, we have the first time we ever talked to Buddy Epson when he was 87 years old.  Yeah, five years ago.  Here it is.  Well, don't you.  You hear that? 
[00:43:30]  Not a crackle in there.  87.  87 years young.  Well, don't you.  Something happened.  Well, don't you.  Nice.  To his voice box.  Okay.  Anthony.  All right.  We fast forward to when he was 90 years old.  Well, doggies.  All right.  You hear the well.  It's all chewed up.  He almost gets the doggies out.  It's still all bashed up, but.  Well, doggies.  All right.  Why don't we compare? 
[00:44:00]  87, Rick?  87.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  90 years old.  Yeah.  One more time.  87 years old.  Well, doggies.  90 years old.  Well, doggies.  All right, kids.  Hold on to your seat.  All right.  Okay.  This is 92 years old.  92.  Buddy Epson.  Well, doggies.  All right.  I got to go home.  What?  We've got to.  We've got to.  Oh, no. 
[00:44:30]  I got to go home.  Oh, poor buddy.  Holy ass.  Oh, that is horrible.  Now, this is just a couple of years.  Let me give money.  No, no.  Let's go right back to 87 years old.  87 years old.  Well, doggies.  90 years old.  Well, doggies.  92 years old.  Well, doggies.  That's not even funny, you ass.  We've got to. 
[00:45:00]  And two years from now.  It gets higher and higher.  We've got to doggies.  We've got to doggies.  I need to hear that one more time.  87 years old.  Well, doggies.  90 years old.  Well, doggies.  92 years old.  Well, doggies. 
[00:45:30]  That's my joker from Jersey.  When you guys asked him to say, well, doggie again, I was waiting for him to say, why, I  did it right the first time.  Get me a jury.  All right.  We better take a break.  Poor buddy.  That's awful.  God, age.  I want to leave with the song.  Where did we go?  Because I think.  Oh, you got it?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  As we go to break, Buddy Epson.  Singing. 
[00:46:00]  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family  fed.  And then one day, oh, he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Hugo.  After hearing that, all I have to say is, I hear dead people.  Okay.  This is Hugo.  Cut it out.  Oh, he's rocking. 
[00:46:30]  Buddy Epson.  92.  God bless him.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  212-757-1027.  212-757-1027.  1-027-WNEW.  I feel so alive.  For the very first time.  I can't deny you.  I feel so alive.  I feel so alive.  For the very first time. 
[00:47:00]  And I think I can fly.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027.  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4-WOW.  Dawn, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What you doing?  Talking to you.  I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me out.  Okay.  I'm here at my boyfriend's house right now.  He's at work, and he should be home pretty soon. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And what I wanted to do for him was surprise him with a really great night of sex, but also to do anal.  You're taking the big step, huh?  Well, we tried it once, and it was a little bit painful for me.  And I didn't know if you guys had any tips that maybe you've used in the past that maybe I could let him know,  because he's probably listening right now.  Or maybe you might be able to follow up.  You've tried it before?  Yeah, it didn't really work out the entire way.  What was the problem? 
[00:48:00]  It hurt.  Okay.  Terrific.  It hurt.  Yeah, it just wasn't as...  I just didn't know if there was just some way that you guys knew of just, like, making it feel a little bit better.  I know it's going to hurt.  Well, are you lubricating or anything?  Yeah, we use that, but I have a lot myself, so...  Yeah, see, that's, you know...  I think you've got to work yourself up into a froth.  Yeah, I...  Oh, absolutely.  I suggest you drink, like, a gallon of wine.  Any booze?  Is any booze coming into play?  Get some of that cheap box wine. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, of course.  There's always wine here.  The wine in the box.  The $6 box?  Yeah.  Yeah, the expensive one.  And what is he doing?  Is he just kind of climbing a board and going to town?  Well, you know, the whole foreplay business first, but then...  No, I mean, right at the point of, you know, where he's ready to go.  I mean, does he, uh...  Is he gentle?  Yes, he is.  He doesn't just, like, you know, plunge into it or anything.  I mean, have you tried, like, a shoehorn?  Is he a big man?  Uh, bigger than average. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe you just need different lubricant.  Maybe that could help.  You know.  So what happens?  It's just hurting a lot.  Yeah, it was just...  It got to a point where there was just this one part, like, yo, and, you know,  then it was like, okay, I can't do this right now.  Oh, a little resistance?  Yeah.  Maybe you're not relaxing enough.  Maybe you're clenching up.  Yeah, that's why you got to get a little more relaxed, a little more wine.  Yeah.  You pretty much just got to suck it up.  You're almost there.  You're almost there. 
[00:49:30]  Take the pain!  Take the pain!  Hey, are you going to be doing the anal before the end of the show?  Um, probably not.  Probably about seven.  Oh, damn.  I know.  He doesn't get out of work until seven.  Hmm.  He'd love to have him on the phone while he tries.  I wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't mind it.  So, guys, I...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Okay, guys, I'm ready.  My boyfriend's going to attempt right now.  I don't think we should have a problem.  I'm pretty lubricated. 
[00:50:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Well, there's a lot of guys that want to give you advice on how to take it.  Okay.  I don't know.  This could get ugly.  All right, we'll try one and see where it goes, okay?  All right.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're on with Dawn.  Hi, Dawn.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Not bad.  Uh, listen, the only thing, when I introduce my ex-wife to it...  All right, Joe, be careful.  I want as much of this on the radio as possible.  Go ahead.  Oh, I'll be...  Oh, it's perfect. 
[00:50:30]  All right, go ahead.  No problem.  When I introduce my ex-wife to it...  Okay.  ...instead of being up on all fours...  Mm-hmm.  ...on your back.  Oh, that's...  With your legs up.  With your legs way up.  Way up.  Behind my ears?  Oh, if you can.  Like you're hanging neat.  I'm serious.  Yeah?  The ankle is a lot better.  Okay.  I'll keep that in mind.  All right?  Well, thank you, Joe.  Oh, and hey, you're the best.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Well, Joe, give him some advice.  Let's see if another guy has some advice here, Anthony. 
[00:51:00]  Let's go to Fred.  Fred, you're on with Dawn.  Hey, Dawn, how are you?  How are you doing all the time?  Hey, Fred, keep it between the lines so we can get this on the radio.  Do you have some advice for Dawn?  We're going to do our best here, guys.  Okay.  Now, listen, what I've found is the best way is on all fours for her, and what you have  to get her to do...  Dawn, are you listening?  I am.  Okay, what you have to do is you've got to get all worked up for this, and then when  you reach the point when you guys are going to initiate the act, you have to keep on going. 
[00:51:30]  You have to keep on ****** down there.  You follow what I'm saying here?  Yep.  Okay, because that's going to kind of take your mind off of it.  Is that possible?  Okay.  It's going to keep you going where you're not going to mind.  It's going to make you puke.  You're not going to want to stop.  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, look, Dawn's getting all sorts of advice from my list, Anthony.  Isn't that great?  And you thought it was going to be so bad.  I want another lady to give you advice, Dawn. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, the guy advice thing.  I don't know if that works as well.  Just later.  Hey, Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  You're on with Dawn.  Hey, Dawn, I agree with both of those guys.  That's right.  And you can't have it all like...  You've got to be worked up, and you've really got to be into it.  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm.  And I tell you, the best lubrication is like spit your saliva.  I swear to God, if you ****** down here...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't say that, Steve. 
[00:52:30]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  You're having ******, and he just slowly...  All right, all right, all right.  All right.  It works out a lot better, and you've really got to just keep it going.  You know, keep yourself into it.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, man.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Didn't know Sammy was into that.  Hey, Frank.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  What's going on?  I think you've got to be the last call.  We're in dangerous territory here.  All right, now I'm going to be real cool, real careful for you, all right?  Okay.  We'll stay on the air, I promise.  All right, you're on with Dawn.  What's your name, Dawn?  Dawn, yes. 
[00:53:00]  All right, check it out.  There's a product on the market, no jokes, swear to God, it's called Anal Ease.  Oh, I saw that down in the village.  No joke, it works, Dawn.  Now, I don't know from experience, but what the women told me underneath me, they said  it didn't hurt as much.  Tell your man to take it slow and easy.  Okay, terrific.  Well, Dawn, what do you think?  I think it's going to go good.  Yeah.  Well, now there's a lady calling that wants to give you advice.  We've got to get one lady on to help you out.  Okay.  Vicki.  Yeah.  You got some advice for Dawn?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Dawn?  Hey, Vic. 
[00:53:30]  Hi, how you doing?  I'm good.  Those guys are giving you some bad advice.  Some of it's good, some of it's bad.  That up in the air, legs up in the air thing?  No, that hurts.  No.  Very painful.  That's no good.  No.  As far as, you know, keeping the pleasuring with the ****, that's good.  Okay.  That works.  The easiest way is lots of lubrication.  Turn on your side. 
[00:54:00]  How about a butt plug?  No.  I don't think that would work.  Danny?  Turn on your side.  Okay.  And that is what I found to be about the most enjoyable for you.  Some of the other ways can be incredibly painful.  All right.  Mary, Mary, can I give you anal ****?  Please, please, please, Mary.  Mary, I need anal, Mary.  I bet you do that.  I've already asked Murr. 
[00:54:30]  And Lou, Lou, Lou won't give me anal.  I'm leaving.  How about I just bend over Spaulding?  I'll get my **** in like it.  Holly, what's up?  Hi, how you doing?  How are you?  Good, you guys are great.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah.  I want to give Dawn some advice about the anal ease.  Yes.  Okay.  Great stuff.  Yeah?  The only way I can take it.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  You know, you see these girls take it in the movies and stuff, and you're like, there's 
[00:55:00]  no way.  But, yeah, you get it with the anal ease, and you take it like a pro.  Okay, terrific.  I've got to pick that up.  You can pick that up.  Anal ease.  Anal ease, yeah.  Wow, popular item.  It is.  It's great stuff.  Yeah, they have a bunch of it, doesn't it?  I think it's a little better if the girl goes in and makes the purchase, though.  I'll tell you the truth.  I need anal ease, please.  Mr. Farmer says, can I get some anal ease, please?  It's for me, Marie and Lou. 
[00:55:30]  Just have him put a little bit on his ****.  All right.  We know how to apply.  Put it on the, uh, DJ.  If you put it on the guy.  All right, all right, all right.  All right, thank you.  What?  Yeah, if you put it on the guy, it'll numb him.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, you know what that?  So.  Oh, it's supposed, is it like a numbing agent, too?  And a lubricant?  It's like some stuff.  That's what you want.  That's what you want.  Yeah, that's what you want in lovemaking.  Something that'll numb the pain.  Kind of like, novocate. 
[00:56:00]  I noticed a few blows to the **** usually loosens the area up and puts enough blood there to lubricate.  That's what you want.  And then once you're there, and actually in the act of anal ****, I noticed some kidney punches usually make a clinch up, and it feels good.  And they're not as apt to press charges if you punch them hard.  So remember, anal tips, drink a lot, don't fight back, bite the pillow, and bleed a lot.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you, Mike Tyson.  Yeah, F you.  All right, Holly, thank you.  Thanks, Holly.  Good luck, Dawn.  Thank you so much.  All right, bye-bye.  Good luck.  Wishing each other well in the wonderful world of anal.  It's like a novocaine for the butt.  Yeah.  I wonder if you get like, you know when you go to the dentist and your lip gets all numb and droopy?  Same thing, it's just a different type of drilling.  Go ahead, rinse.  Valerie, what's going on?  Dawn has to lay on her stomach. 
[00:57:00]  On her stomach.  Now, you guys have all suggested lay on the stomach, lay on the back, lay on the side, do it all fours.  Not on all fours.  She's got a first play on her stomach, so it's complete ****, then get on all fours.  Oh, yeah?  Well, there's a move when it's, uh...  Yeah, because it's easier to go in when you're on your stomach, and you enjoy it more when you're on all fours.  All right.  Thank you, Valerie.  Thanks.  Okay.  Be sure the area's basted in a lot of rubricans. 
[00:57:30]  That's how I like my anal.  Be sure there's plenty.  Take a turkey baster and just marinade the area.  Be sure it's properly marinade the leather Cheerio, and lay on your stomach, gals, like a big, like a big turkey, and then get stuffed like a holiday turkey as you baste the area of the leather Cheerio in lubricant. 
[00:58:00]  Marinade.  And then take the stuffing made of hot beef.  Stuff that turkey.  Just stuff the big, fat turkey that's well lubricated with the lubricant.  Marinade.  Bon appetit with your anal.  Bon appetit.  Bon appetit.  That's right, only a properly lubricated marinade balloonade will be pleasurable to all the people. 
[00:58:30]  Look at the way I enjoy it with my big, fat, old ass.  It's usually best served with a tossed salad.  Hey, hey, Karen, you got some.  And a fine wine, fine wine, marinade loosens the area up.  Bon appetit.  Bon appetit.  Okay, terrific.  She's going to let me talk.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Karen, you got some advice for Dawn? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, actually, she should just get KY Jelly from the drugstore.  KY.  Yeah.  That works the best.  KY.  And to be on all sorts of things.  KY Jelly or KY Jam.  And honestly, if you could just get her boyfriend hooked up, it'll be so quick that it doesn't usually last you long.  Quick and painless is how I like it.  Okay.  Take a deep breath and it'll be over so fast.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  Proper lubricant. 
[00:59:30]  Perhaps something in a chicken base.  Or maybe some jam.  All right, Joanie.  Strawberry preserve.  Hey, what's up, Joanie?  How are you guys?  Good.  All right, Dawn, I want some advice for you.  Okay, go.  You have to lay completely flat on your stomach.  And actually push like you're trying to.  All right, all right.  All right, listen, listen, listen. 
[01:00:00]  Listen, we had to dump out of that.  You can't say that.  That's sound advice.  Maybe Julia Child could like, uh...  We understand that sound advice.  Julia Child, could you translate what didn't make it on the radio?  Yes, let's say you're stuffing a holiday turkey.  It would help if the turkey felt like it was to push the stuffing back out.  Push. 
[01:00:30]  And remember, plenty of more and on.  The only way it works is with more and on.  I know I used to enjoy anal a lot more, but the men seem to roll off of my hunchback these days.  You see my boobs?  Sweat socks full of sand.  Well, I didn't know how else to put it.  That's okay, Joanie.  Thank you.  All right, good luck, Dylan.  Bon appétit! 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Melanie, what's up?  I actually just wanted to advise her.  Astro Glide is the thing to use.  Astro Glide?  What the hell is that?  That's the best.  Is that a type of lubricant?  Yeah, it is.  It's like the best.  All right.  Wow.  I didn't know.  If you have a position, she's just got to like maneuver her body a certain way.  It's just, it's weird, but...  Like a big holiday ham!  Makeup objects look like a giant holiday ham!  And you're ready to glaze it! 
[01:01:30]  Glaze it!  Make a little target with a slice of pineapple, perhaps, right around the leather Cheerio with  plenty of more and odd.  You know, you poke the holiday ham with cloves and cherries.  Just put a big slice of pineapple right around the leather Cheerios.  Drive away, stuff away!  Like a big stuffed pork chump.  But the most important thing is the more and odd. 
[01:02:00]  No, guys.  Guys.  Yeah.  The most important thing is to have you go real slow.  Okay.  If it's too fast, it'll kill us.  Slow and steady, Windsor.  Thank you, Marilyn.  All right.  Bye-bye.  You want to let you cook all of your chicken very slowly.  You know, it wouldn't be good if you just used a whole f***ing jam for stuffing it.  Oh, God.  No, thanks.  I got the sickest visual in my head right now.  Julia Child loves anal.  Can you imagine what that looks like? 
[01:02:30]  It looks just like one of those red-ass monkeys.  My balloon nut!  My 85-year-old balloon nut!  Oh!  Mom!  Look, I'm making my own morning nut!  Oh!  Oh!  No, Julia, you're making your own brown sauce.  Oh, brown sauce!  It's almost like a bowl of eggs!  Okay, terrific. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Let's take a break.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We'll be right back. 
[01:03:30]  I'm up on the field again.  Hey, I'm up here.  I'm up here.  I'm up here.  I'm up here.  I'm up here.  I'm up here.  I'm up here.  I'm up here.  Natalie Cole.  Who knew this was going down? 
[01:04:00]  Did you hear about this?  No.  You know Natalie Cole, right?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  She's a daughter of Nat King Cole.  Ex-Junkie.  The whole thing.  She's a daughter of Nat King Cole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you know she knows a little bit.  Right?  Well, she came out with her drug problem a while back.  And, you know, she got everything back into shape.  A couple albums out with her father singing harmony with her.  A little weird head father.  Yeah.  Dead father singing harmony.  But, um, now, I mean, she's revealing everything. 
[01:04:30]  And it's not pretty.  Well, because her career needs a little bump up.  You think that's it?  Admitting that she was a junkie helped her for a little while.  It did.  And then, uh, her career got a nice spike.  Now it's going down again.  So she's like, well, what else can I tell the public?  Little more.  She's a man.  Right?  Uh, no.  Natalie Cole says 25 years ago she was so broke she sold herself for sex to feed her drug habit.  Whoa.  Yes.  I did it to survive.  I didn't have anywhere to go.  Wow.  I got nowhere else to go. 
[01:05:00]  It's coming out.  Natalie Cole.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  How much did she get from her body, did she?  Yeah, I wonder.  You know, that's got to be a selling point.  Yeah.  Hey, not only, you know, am I this, but I'm Nat King Cole's, uh, daughter.  $1,000 an hour?  I'll sing into your mind.  How's that?  I think she was going like the, nah, I think it's crack whore rates.  You know what it is, though?  Crack ho.  When you're looking to pay off the drug tab, your, uh, your price goes way down. 
[01:05:30]  Like what?  20 bucks?  Yeah, like whatever it is for your dope.  Or something for, you know, maybe just dope.  Not even cash.  Who cares?  Yeah, five bucks.  Five bucks.  Makes your CDs seem expensive.  Man, I will suck your...  Remember that?  What was that, New Jack City?  New Jack.  Yeah, they put a goof in there, but the original thing was, I think, from New Jack City or something.  Well, the story goes, desperate times call for desperate measures.  Just asked Natalie Cole, who admits that when she was struggling for money to support her drug addiction 25 years ago, 
[01:06:00]  she resorted to selling her body to get enough money to feed her habit.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  Uh, business...  Business was, like, under the bridge up in Harlem somewhere,  and all we wanted to do was just get our stuff and get the hell out of there, Cole.  During tonight's 2020 downtown interview.  It's going to be on 2020 downtown.  2020.  You know, get the money, go get the drugs, go get high.  Cole.  Cole's battle with heroin drove her to become what she calls a come-on-girl, Anthony. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, anybody can...  Is that it?  Uh, someone who would act as a liaison between a prostitute and a customer.  However, she says that at one point she did perform sex for money.  A come-on-girl, it's called.  How much is that?  For two weeks, says Cole, I did it to survive.  I literally did it to survive.  I didn't have anywhere to go.  Aww. 
[01:07:00]  I had no money, and I just put myself in a position that I was willing to try even that,  because heroin is what my body needed.  The horror.  The horror.  Horror.  Aww.  Remember this?  Remember?  I think she was a whore.  Poor dad looking down.  Unforgettable.  Unforgettable.  Unforgettable.  Unforgettable.  Unforgettable.  Unforgettable.  Unforgettable.  That's awful. 
[01:07:30]  Unforgettable.  Can we see your stuff?  That's groot.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Aww.  You use your tongue prettier than a twenty-dollar horn. 
[01:08:00]  I'm sticking it in my mouth.  It looks like a moron.  It's in the hole.  I got it from a negro.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  You're a fizzing whore.  That's how you say.  May you please. 
[01:08:30]  That's why, darling, it's in the hole.  Your day is the f***ing old Mary Gay brush front through her pretty pink patties are over.  Virgin.  I don't think so.  A p***a!  You've got some funky tastings.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes! 
[01:09:00]  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hey, everybody!  We're all gonna get laid!  Hey!  Oh, you're very naughty.  Oh, you're very naughty. 
[01:09:30]  Okay, brother.  Unforgettable.  What about our huge bacon hooters, huh?  Freeway!  What are you people?  On dope?  That's how you're doing.  Take it in my mouth.  F***ing sex.  F***ing sex.  That's how you're going to be. 
[01:10:00]  It's incredible.  Those men want to have sex with me.  So unforgettable.  A poosa.  A poosa.  A poosa.  Unforgettable.  Got milk?  Ouch.  F***ing sex.  Ouch.  Cancel your appointments! 
[01:10:30]  Wonderful.  Goddamn, that's funny, man.  There you go.  A timeless classic.  Natalie Cole Remix.  How dare we, huh?  Black.  Curl romantic.  It's yarling.  I'm just getting all so romantic.  I made a funny, son, and you're not laughing.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's wonderful. 
[01:11:00]  Boy, but she has overcome that.  When was that?  Does anyone know what?  Does she say?  Like, what point in her life that was?  Last week.  Last week.  I don't know.  Where's this one?  I'm over it now.  What is she, 25 years?  I'm only down to two Cs a week.  What did she say?  25 years ago.  25 years ago.  Who wasn't doing, uh, having sex for heroin money back then?  Come on.  Come on.  We can all be honest.  Right, Jim?  Right?  Yeah.  How do you think Jim got his money to start up the brewery?  Sex for heroin.  I'm just heroin for sex.  1027 W&EW. 
[01:11:30]  New York.  Open Anthony.  W&EW.  212 Cs a week.  312 Cs.  Wh&EW. 
[01:12:00]  312 Cs a week.  312 Cs a week.  121 Cs a month.  Hey, you're checking out O&A, Opie and Anthony, 877-692-1027. 
[01:12:30]  The blind guys are here, Anthony.  Yes.  I think you're having second downs, aren't you?  You know, nice guys, and the one guy, who is it?  It's Blind Dave and Blind Matt, and Blind Matt.  Blind Matt's got a dog.  Blind Matt has a dog.  He's got the C&I dog.  We've already told him he can't use the dog in the box.  That's right.  All of a sudden, he goes for the legs and just...  But we're going to have to hide the dog, because if Dave starts, you know, punching Matt... 
[01:13:00]  I know.  ...the dog may get pissed off and want to jump in.  We got problems here today.  What the hell are we going to do?  We've got to say hi to Bill Dwyer real fast.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We've got you live.  What's going on, man?  You guys are the greatest.  Listen, you've got to put the dog somewhere else, because he's going to go ape.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I think you're right.  Are there no rules anymore to blind boxing?  Are there no more sanctions to blind boxing? 
[01:13:30]  Of course, we're talking to one of the announcers of BattleBots.  Yes.  We have our own little thing that we like to call CrippleBots, Bill.  I know.  I heard about it.  Oh, man.  I can't wait to check out the one-legged boxers.  One-legged boxing happened yesterday.  The clip we have on our website is hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  The one guy just got killed.  Got killed.  Bill?  We had a three-legged dog when I was a kid, and we'd make him sit, and then we'd try and 
[01:14:00]  make him give us his paw.  Oh, that is cruel.  That is cruel.  Oh, yeah.  I'm cruel.  And you guys are introducing the contestants as Blind Matt and Blind Dave.  Well, they're blind, and that's their name.  Well, yeah.  They're really blind, and they both have great senses of humor, man.  Hey, Bill, it's not like we're letting poor defenseless machines go in the middle of an  arena to bash each other, so don't be a hypocrite.  Hey, we're copying BattleBots.  We have, like, obstacles in the ring and everything for the blind guys. 
[01:14:30]  What do I care?  We have a hacksaw that just pops up in the middle of our boxing ring.  Man, are the blind guys going to be surprised when that happens?  That's why you've got to lay the titanium over your sack.  One of the things we've got going is very reminiscent of BattleBots.  We're going to get two guys, each in wheelchairs, and we're going to give them various weapons  they can choose from, like the mace or the lance or a big hammer, and we're going to let  them go at it in our arena, and it'll look like BattleBots, I think.  Yeah, well, it's called wheelchair jousting. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Why are you guys in radio?  Why not pay-per-view?  Oh, I know.  Pay-per-view.  That's what I say.  Pay-per-view's on the way, my friend.  I miss you guys, by the way.  Well, yeah.  When are you going to be in New York?  I don't know.  Soon?  We're back here.  We had fun last time you were in.  Yeah, I had a ball.  This is the day you should be here.  Blind boxing, come on.  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  Are they going to wear, like, special beeping things on their heads?  They've got little bells.  Cat bells.  Really?  Cat bells.  Cat bells.  Yeah.  So when they jingle, they'll know where to go. 
[01:15:30]  16-ounce gloves?  They're pretty heavy gloves, sure.  Yeah, it's...  16-ounce gloves?  Okay.  No one will get hurt too badly.  It's real boxing equipment.  I'm truly excited.  Hey, should we bring the blind guys in while we have Bill on the line?  Sure.  Maybe he wants to ask a question.  I'll make sure I don't say, have you guys ever seen BattleBots?  You know, I'll try not to make that awkward moment.  Well, the one guy said to the other the other day, he goes, I'm going to run circles around  you.  And the other guy goes, we'll see.  We'll see.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:16:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  The one-legged boxing yesterday, classic, because the one guy was in really good shape.  I wouldn't mess with him.  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding.  He works out all the time.  And when he was hopping on his one leg, it was very, very nice and very controlled, up  and down, short strokes, right?  Yeah.  The other guy, when he was hopping, he would hop like three feet to the right, four feet  back to the left.  Side to side.  He's going in with two hands, trying to punch.  It was really bad.  How long did he last?  Seconds. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, man.  And then just got knocked right the F out.  All right.  We're sitting Blind Dave and Blind Matt, right?  There they go.  Look at the dog.  Hey, Blind Dave, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey, someone's got to put the microphone in his face.  He doesn't know.  All right.  You got it.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  We have Bill Dwyer from BattleBots on the line.  Hey, Matt and Dave.  Have you guys ever...  I don't know.  Have you ever listened to BattleBots?  No, but I heard him on your show.  He's real funny.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  There's no reason to listen to BattleBots, I would assume.  Why?  Maybe there.  I don't know.  Oh, Opie. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Are you going to make fun of me?  He's going to make fun of me.  Here we go.  The guy has a dog with him, and I believe him, but remember my test?  What's your test?  Crinkle, crinkle.  When I was here last time.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Oh, right, right, right.  Throwing the...  Ah!  I want equal testing.  Oh, you want to make sure...  Oh, all right.  I know what he's saying.  I know what he's saying.  If you throw something at me, precious, it'll be you and me with the gloves on. 
[01:17:30]  I think we could assume he's blind.  I don't think...  You know, who's going to go the distance and get the dog and everything?  What Dave is saying...  Dogs are cheap.  What Dave is saying...  Last time we had Dave in here, we didn't really believe that he was blind, so we threw a piece  of paper to see if he would react to it.  And he wants us to do that to Matt, because he wants to make sure he's fighting a true blind  guy.  Oh.  But...  Yeah.  I'd say he's blind.  Yeah, Matt...  Can you see anything, Matt?  No, I can't.  I have two prosthetic eyes.  It's completely...  Those are fake eyes? 
[01:18:00]  They are.  Wow.  No...  Can you take an artist?  I could.  Well, let's not...  No, I cannot deal with that.  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!  I'm not looking.  Do it!  Wait, I'm sure a bunch of people have told you.  Those are really good eyes.  Yeah, they're not bad.  It's...  And if I wasn't listening through headphones, I'd probably look right at you when we were talking,  but...  Really?  It's deceiving.  It sounds like you're in my head.  Oh, Jesus.  And you could...  Oh, yeah, because the blind guys have the super ears. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, there's no chance an eye is going to pop out if Dave punches you.  No, I certainly hope not.  I mean, I can...  Oh, my God.  Wait, can you pop one of the eyes out?  No!  Is it hard to do?  Do it.  Holy ass.  Holy ass!  Oh, my God.  No, no, he just...  Yeah, he just did it.  Oh, that is great.  Oh, my God.  Holy ass!  Oh, Pete, you suck, man.  Oh, my God.  No, I wanted it, too, man.  I want to know. 
[01:19:00]  How easy was that?  Let me tell you something, Dave.  I can tell you for sure that this guy is blind.  Okay.  Well, that's one eye, though.  I don't know that the other one might see good.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen anything like that before.  What do you think?  Oh!  I know what sucks is...  That rocks.  That's a good party trick, man.  Oh, it used to be a great party trick.  You're invited to my next party because look at him.  The eyes look completely like he has normal eyes.  When he stares in your direction, it looks like he's got...  You know, he's looking at you and he can pop it out.  Hey, invite me to the next Opie party. 
[01:19:30]  I'll be there with eyes out.  The road show?  I'm feeling beaten here.  Let me tell you something.  If we bring him to the next road show in front of 3,800 people, he does that trick?  Oh, my God.  You think we get a reaction when Big Butt Mendy shows her butt?  Matt, that's...  Wow!  What do you guys think?  Did he pop out both eyes?  Do you ever sneeze and have him just fly out?  Just one, but the other one works as well.  Comes out also.  Sweet.  I was talking to a friend the other day and they were like,  what color eyes would you want if you could have them?  I said, any color I want.  All I got to do is go to the artist and tell them what color I want. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, you could put in some wacky vampire eyes.  Yeah, absolutely.  Hey, when you're hungover, do you pop in the bloodshot ones?  Realism, you know?  Realism, right?  You got to watch out.  Gay Marco might get horny here.  Matt, how long have you been blind?  Since I'm five.  I'm 31.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Gay Marco, I will not leave an eye out for you.  It's probably the only place he hasn't violated on some guy.  Jesus.  Oh, blind Steve, even though I talked to you on the phone and you sound like a nice guy, 
[01:20:30]  you're still a puss because you're not here, even though it's your friend.  Oh, Steve, they're talking to you, baby.  Yeah, blind.  You still talked a lot of crap, but it's two days later, you couldn't make it two days ago  and you couldn't make it today.  You're a puss.  Wow.  Yeah, blind Dave really wanted to fight blind Steve when he's got blind Matt.  I'm not mad at this guy.  Hey, guys, since I'm not there, how does this match look between the two blind guys?  Do they look pretty evenly matched?  Yeah, they're about the same height, I would say.  I'd say this is pretty even.  Hey, Dave, how tall are you? 
[01:21:00]  About 6'1".  And Matt?  5'9 1⁄2".  Oh, he's got the height advantage.  He's got the weight, too.  I'm about 170.  Oh, you guys discussed all this?  No, but I heard Stephen was telling me the other day that Dave is 6'1 and about 200 or something.  Yeah.  And how was the limo ride?  Oh, I've got to thank Car-O.  Car-O for Vital Transportation.  No, Top Dodge Limo there.  I know Opie's beeping it out.  You know what? 
[01:21:30]  No, but that guy was really cool.  They sent their best limo for you guys.  It was a van.  It wasn't a limo.  You could tell.  Even the blind guy could tell that.  No, but it was really...  This is something we make fun of all the time in the show.  Even the blind guy knew that he was in a bus and not a lot.  No, it wasn't a bus.  It was really cool.  It was really like a luxury ride.  The guy was really cool to us.  And I tried to slip the guy a few bucks even, and he would not take it.  And he let us smoke.  And no one lets him do that. 
[01:22:00]  He was there at like quarter to one.  And I get a thing from Rick saying, instead of two o'clock, it might be more around 1.30.  It's like quarter to one.  There's a car outside.  Someone, you know, beeping.  I got to ask Steve.  Steve, did you get a video of Blind Matt?  Yeah, I did.  I caught the tail end of it.  If you wouldn't mind, can you pop the other one out?  We would put it on the website.  You would be the star.  Okay.  Hold on.  This is the other eye, Dave, to prove that this guy's completely blind. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, because I know it's right.  Send it to the satellite right now, gentlemen.  I am not looking.  I need to see this.  For all I know, I could be getting set up.  They could just be hamming it up.  No, no.  No, I don't know.  I'm guessing with the dog.  See, he's banging the eyeball on the mic for you.  Oh, God, don't touch it up.  Who was talking in this mic last?  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:00]  That is unbelievable.  I will wear that blindfold and, Anthony, take a look through it and see if you can see anything.  Oh, no.  This gets completely blacked out.  I have a little, little bit of sight, but just to make it even, I will wear that blindfold.  Yeah, Matt, you know about that.  Dave, can you see our faces right now?  No, not at all.  What do you see right now?  Shadows.  He's lights and shadows.  How about it?  Everything looks black to here.  I see a light over here.  If I look this way, I see that there's a light right somewhere. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, so you're just seeing, like, little spots of light.  What's the game plan?  To put me with a lit-up lamp or something on my head?  A little light on your head.  That's it.  You just see little pieces of light.  No, I see light and dark, but, like, my right eye saw little fragments and stuff, but that's kind of gone.  But my left eye, I can see Anthony's hand.  Oh, really?  On the mic?  No, right here.  Oh, on the table?  On your leg?  Yeah.  You could be spanking it for all I know. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  These guys are...  No, no, I'm not.  Wow.  I just need to ask the listener something.  If we put a still shot of Blurring Matt popping his eye out, wouldn't you check it out on WNEW.com?  I think they'd check it out.  That's when my eyes go.  That's what I want, man.  When my eyes are completely gone, I want them out of my head so I can do that.  Because that's a talent, man.  I've got to ask a really stupid question, Dave.  Is there any hope for you?  I mean, because I'm sure you're up on the research. 
[01:24:30]  There is hope, and there is actually a number that I don't have with me for...  I mean, RP is a horrible, slow, torture disease where you lose your sight little by little.  And I didn't bring the number because, to be frank, to be truthful, if I didn't have it, I wouldn't give a rat's ass.  Oh, wow.  That's honest.  It's like, do you think Christopher Reeves gave a rat's ass about quadriplegics before he became one?  No.  No.  So for me to sit here and go, give to the blind people. 
[01:25:00]  I'm trying to help them.  It would be a bunch of BS.  I would be wanting to help me.  Oh, man.  Because I wouldn't really care if it hadn't happened to me.  But I do know now what it's like, you know, to be on the other side.  Right.  You know what, Dave?  You're doing something cool for the show.  You've got to give us a number.  I don't have it.  I know.  Tomorrow or Monday or something.  Because there are people out there that'll...  Yeah, because there are hundreds of people that call people on the phone every night, and it would do better for it to go on your show. 
[01:25:30]  And that's not a plug for someone trying to get over, someone trying to get their business going, or something like that.  How close are they to figuring something out, though?  It'll probably be like, we could have fixed you if it was ten years ago.  Oh!  You know how that is, but, you know, it'll probably...  I'm sure sometime in my lifetime it'll be fixable, but it'll probably be when it's too late for me.  I don't know.  And in my case, they say that there is hope that someday there will be a, you know, a chance that... 
[01:26:00]  Obviously, I don't have the machinery, as y'all just saw, but that they could hook some sort of camera device up to my brain or something like that.  But I've been blind since I'm five, and I'm just happy this way.  Yeah.  I don't want to have to look at the sorry bastards I call my friends.  So, I'm just dandy.  Hey, Bill, are you in shock yet?  I can't believe it.  I'm on the website, too, hoping you guys will pop something on there.  We just sent the pictures.  They're going to be up on WNEW.com. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, and here...  There's a picture that Steve was brave enough to take, because Rick pushed out.  And what, you took a picture of Matt with the eye out of his...  Yeah, I got one real close-up shot of Matt's left eye socket.  Yes.  And then one of him holding the glass eye up and smiling.  Proudly.  Yes, very proudly.  Matt, you're right.  And let me tell you, the guys who made these eyes, a little plug for LeGrand Associates.  Are they hell of artists or what?  Yeah, definitely.  Hand-painted, baby.  Dave, you have a driver's license? 
[01:27:00]  My friend who, I don't know if he's out here or not, but in here or not, but I was legally blind, right?  And it was almost four years ago, this October, or it was like in November or whatever.  I didn't have the cane yet, and I could see good enough where I could pass myself off.  And my friend goes, and in Connecticut, you don't have to take an eye test.  You just renew your license.  So my friend goes, okay, it's like 10 paces, and then fill the blue carpet. 
[01:27:30]  And there's a chair about three steps to the right.  Sit down there.  Don't mess up.  And then I went, and I got my picture taken, and I was legally blind.  I don't drive, so I'm not out to kill nobody.  That's hilarious.  And then I went up.  They called my name.  He was renewing his license, and it was an invisible ink pen.  And he goes, oh, no, he's not going to know.  And I just went up, and I felt my pockets, and I go, damn it, I forgot my reading glasses.  Can you put my finger where I got a sign?  And we walked out of there, and he's laughing his ass off. 
[01:28:00]  And I'm like, what?  And he goes, you're blind, and they just renewed your license.  And that's facts.  You know what?  He's not kidding.  I'm holding his license in front of me.  And it's valid.  And I had a CDL for John and Lawrence Trucks.  Nice.  I was a tree worker.  I drove chip trucks and bucket trucks.  You know, that was my thing, man.  It's unbelievable.  Did he have a thing on the license that says corrective lenses needed? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, it did.  And that's why the guy didn't bitch about the reading last.  I said, you know, you see it says right there.  He's like, yeah, here, move your finger this way.  And I was like, I can't believe this guy's doing this.  So if I get away with it this October, that would be.  Yeah, now if you do it again.  I think you guys should camera and mic me for it.  Yeah.  Hey, we'll.  Because I'll try.  We'll broadcast the whole thing.  We'll do that.  We'll take bets and everything.  Let's see if Dave can renew his license again. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, it's October.  So you guys have no problem with the blind boxing?  No, we're going to give it a shot.  Give it a shot and stuff.  We got bells.  That helps.  All right.  And what about the dog, Matt?  I'll leave him somewhere where he can't see.  I don't want to be getting mad, man.  Because if the dog sees Dave attacking you, he's going to.  He may not be thrilled.  He's not going to be too happy.  We'll leave him where I won't be.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll put him somewhere.  I'll trust you guys to lead me not into walls and to the boxing circle.  No, we'll do whatever it takes.  I mean, you guys are really cool.  But this is part of the cripple thing, but I think you should call it the BBA on O&A. 
[01:29:30]  Blind boxing alcoholic.  Yeah, you've been down in a couple of things at Jack.  I've been on the wagon for like a month.  I've been down in a few years, and I've got two b*****s.  Where's the bathroom?  You guys, this is radio.  I'm sweating, and my back teeth are floating.  And we had to urinate.  Yeah, we had to dump out of it.  That's okay.  I have to urinate.  I'm sweating.  All right, why don't we get Matt to the bathroom? 
[01:30:00]  Okay, yeah.  Excuse me, gentlemen.  Now, don't worry.  Everyone's treating you guys, you know.  Make sure I don't trip over to your court.  I do that.  Hey, Bill.  That's a great call.  Right here.  If you go in the other room, Opie will be like, did you see that blood on here?  No, I won't.  You know the show.  I want Opie in my corner, though, because Opie is a genius one.  No, I think Matt's cool.  You know, I have nothing bad to say to him, man.  No, this is good, but if Steve was here, that would be a better fight.  Yeah.  I would really want to hurt him. 
[01:30:30]  You can still take on Steve.  Well, we're going to videotape all this.  Hey, Bill.  I am right here.  So, what do you think?  I'm so excited.  Yeah.  I can't.  I just wish I was there.  I know.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Well, you've got to drop by.  Well, we're going to have video on foundrymusic.com.  We're going to have a couple still shots on www.com very, very soon.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah, that's where I'm at right now.  All right.  Bill.  Yeah.  When's the new season start?  Uh, new season started Tuesday. 
[01:31:00]  Tuesday.  They're going to be rerunning it.  Uh, of course, you know, because it's Comedy Central, rerun it over and over.  Friday, uh, 9 p.m.  Cool.  Check it out.  Oh, and it's sweet, man.  Yeah.  It's sweet.  You know what I heard?  There's no blind boxing.  You know what I heard, Bill?  Like, the people that are getting involved now, it was at the beginning.  You could put one together, maybe a couple hundred bucks, your spare time.  Now, these things are like thousands of dollars worth of machinery getting pounds.  Yeah, some guys are spending, like, you know, $20,000 on a robot. 
[01:31:30]  And how much do you win as first prize?  $8,000.  $8,000.  You watch your $20,000 machine get pummeled, and you might get $8,000.  That's great.  Uh, a lot more sponsors, though, so.  Yeah, I know.  Now they have the sponsors on some of the BattleBots.  Guys getting sponsored?  Yeah.  I mean, it's getting, uh, it's getting pretty heavy duty.  Any favorites returning?  Uh, you know, all the, uh, all the champs, uh, returning, except for our middleweight champ  from last season.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, they're looking good. 
[01:32:00]  But, man, there are some awesome new bots.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I just got really distracted, because, uh, Dave needs a cigarette, and I said, no problem.  Dave, what happened?  I felt my hair move.  You felt your hair?  Oh, you were trying to light it?  Well, you might not have a problem lighting it, because, uh, you can see the light, right?  No, I, uh, you really can't, he can get, uh, you get calluses on your fingers.  It's the biggest bitch if you're a smoker, and you can't see that you're lighter, you  start feeling, you know.  Right. 
[01:32:30]  So you feel for the flames to be there?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So if somebody flips you, like, an extra long one, it screws you up, because you're  light in the middle of a cigarette.  No.  And I've seen BattleBots, man.  It's a great show.  You can take it from me.  It's, I definitely endorse it.  As, as did I, dude, and I don't know who does your color commentary, but they're pretty  good from a blind perspective.  Oh, look at that.  That's me.  That's Bill Dwyer.  That's Bill.  That's me doing the color commentary.  Yeah.  Oh, you're the man.  Remember that there's at least two blind guys listening, so the detail you can give is 
[01:33:00]  there.  I gotta remember that.  Remember that, dude.  You, you, you're no, um, you know, you're not, uh, like, uh, who's the, uh, Walt Clyde  Frazier used to do the color commentary, uh, for the Knicks on the radio?  Yeah.  You gotta do some more bopping and dropping and slipping.  And whatnot.  That drives me nuts when Frazier starts, uh, using words I don't know.  Oh, I love that guy.  Yeah, well, Bob Murphy's a commentating.  All right.  Hey, Bill, we're gonna let you go for now.  All right, you guys.  I'll be, uh, I'll be on the website looking at it. 
[01:33:30]  And, uh, next time you're in New York, you know.  Come on by.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Right on.  Cool.  Thank you.  See you, boys.  It's Bill Dwyer.  Check out Battle Bonds Friday on Comedy Central.  If any ladies want to date me after looking at my eye socket after the website, give me  a call at, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Anthony does...  Kidding.  Does, uh, Mike Tyson, will he be calling in with any advice?  Um...  No, no, not at all.  We, we don't know how to handle this one day.  Punch him in the testicles.  Is it because there's no females involved?  We just... 
[01:34:00]  Uh, Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I used to go to school with Matt up in University of Hartford.  This kid used to get laid left and right, didn't you, Matt?  Hey, baby, that's right.  Really?  There you go.  We were freshmen.  He used to have a keg in his closet.  I know, I think I know who this is.  This is Mark.  I lived in Park Slope.  Was he good or what?  I know who this is, dude.  Greg, it's good to hear from you, buddy.  I hope you kick this guy's ass.  Uh, we'll see what happens.  But, hey, good to hear from you, too, man.  We used to party in my dorm room.  This guy nearly got me expelled.  Nah, just kidding. 
[01:34:30]  Was the blind angle pretty good with the chicks, though?  Uh, well, I had a dog that was almost as good-looking as this, and that's all you need.  Yeah, the good-looking, uh, C&I dog.  You just need a cute dog.  Yep.  And then the girls come up.  Oh, hi, what's your dog's name?  Oh, exactly.  And they all miss their dog because they're away at college and they're fresh.  Oh, there you go.  Can I come to your room and cut your dog?  Yeah, and then I'll introduce you to the hog.  That's it.  Yeah, pet this.  That's my dog.  All right.  Well, I think we're going to take a break.  Yeah, we'll take a break, and we'll, uh, get everybody in position. 
[01:35:00]  And when we come back, we'll do some, um, blind boxing.  I just need to ask, is that...  My big, fag bandana.  I forgot my big, fag cowboy eye.  Why is Dave doing some eyes?  Nice.  Not too bad, man.  I just need to ask, are the pictures up on WNEW.com of Matt?  Ben is checking.  Let's, uh, hold on a second.  Very crucial.  Can we get Dave to show his brown eye?  Okay.  Oh, okay. 
[01:35:30]  If you want to see what we just saw, if you want to see what we just saw, go to WNEW.com.  I think it's more of your brown eye, your red eye, actually.  Yeah, exactly.  We share it.  We share it with our listeners, and there you have it.  Ten minutes after we saw it, you can see it for yourself.  Remember, I asked for that.  I'm the one who initiated it.  Wow.  When I go completely blind, that's what I want.  You're right. 
[01:36:00]  So we'll be back with Blind Dave and Blind Matt.  It's blind boxing, minutes away on the Opie and Anthony Show, right, Anthony?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Two guys getting kicked hard, right in the crotch, with no protection.  All right, I guess he's ready to be, uh, he's ready to be kicked.  Oh, no, this is just wrong, man. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, how did this degenerate into this?  He is on his knees.  He is chained to the bottom of the chair.  His, uh, stuff, as it would be, is a little too prominent in those bikini, uh, panties.  Pearl panties.  He put on his sister's, his little sister's, uh, panties today.  Isn't that cute?  She's putting a thing in his mouth to bite on.  Panties.  Panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, I didn't know.  Oh, those are your panties?  Spike.  Yeah.  She's got the whip, too. 
[01:37:00]  She's bending his head back, straddling him, and she's whipping his, uh, body, his tummy  and lower region.  That's gotta hurt.  That has gotta hurt.  Oh, that got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  Look, he almost fell down.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Spike, you know, Spike is comforting him now, F. 
[01:37:30]  Spike is comforting him now.  Did you see him flinch?  And he hasn't been kicked yet.  That was just the whip.  He's lining up.  Oh!  Ha!  He's just kicking him.  Oh!  Oh, he just buckled over.  He just doubled over in pain.  He's breathing really heavy.  I have never seen anything like this.  Just lining up again.  Oh!  Oh, he's flinching.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:38:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right, Paul is still on his knees, and Ellen's gonna start kicking him.  She's been done wrong by a lot of guys.  Here she goes.  She's lining up.  Oh!  Paul goes, you didn't even make me flinch.  And then she kicked him.  And then she went for it.  He's flinching now at the drop of the hat.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, that was a good one. 
[01:38:30]  That, he almost fell over.  Oh, look, look.  He's an idiot.  I need a wolf, I think.  You're right, Paul.  Oh.  I just hope I get a seat on the subway.  Are we ready for contestant number two?  I'm a little scared.  I'm ready.  All right, I guess we're ready for more of this.  I would miss this for the world.  Oh, no.  I'm gonna need some water. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God, it's not right.  Oh, my God, it's not right.  Spike knows she hits your heart.  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, my God, I can't take it anymore.  That was a bad one.  I can't take this anymore.  That's a flash.  Is that me or the camera?  I can't see a light.  That's got to be. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, that's got to be it.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be it.  This isn't right.  I got a shot of that on the video.  That will make you cringe.  All right, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  She just gave him three quick shots. 
[01:40:30]  She gave him three quickies.  Yeah.  Grandma gave him three.  All right, hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  How about Grandma?  Grandma is pretty good.  You missed, Grandma.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't turn Grandma like that. 
[01:41:00]  Come on.  Grandma's a good shot.  Oh, yeah.  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him?  Someone's got to put a stop to this.  It's just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us, ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  He's a proof of masculinity.  Oh, sure it is.  A man?  Well, then call me a pussy. 
[01:41:30]  I've found my limit.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:42:00]  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  1027, if you're just tuning in.  Hello.  Oh, boy.  We're a few minutes away from blind boxing.  Yeah.  Blind Dave is here.  Blind Matt.  Both of them great guys.  Funny guys. 
[01:42:30]  This is so effing wrong.  You know, we've been doing a lot of articles lately, Anthony, for magazines.  Yeah.  And every single interviewer has asked if we've ever done a bit where we wish we didn't do that bit.  Or feel that it crosses the line.  They always call it the line.  Thank God we did all our interviews because I think I finally have an answer to that question.  Yeah.  I'm just not feeling this one today.  You're not feeling very good about this? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  I mean, they're two really nice guys.  And they happen to be blind.  And now we're putting them in a situation where they're going to be punching each other.  Oh, my God.  There's a dog running around.  Steve, what are you feeling?  I just got to say.  Hold on.  That mic's off because we're setting up the boxing ring.  Oh, this one's on.  Try that one.  Yes.  Yeah, that's on.  That's on. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  I just got to say, I walked by those two.  And Matt was talking to Dave.  And he said, look, man, just don't break my nose.  And Dave says, dude, I don't know where your nose is.  Don't worry about it.  The trash talk starts.  Dude, I don't know where your nose is.  Oh, I think we need to take some phone calls or something.  Oh, my God.  We're going to need judges.  Who wants to be a judge for this?  What, just in case it comes down to points?  It's going to come down to points.  You think so?  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  How are we working?  What's the format here?  It's going to be rounds?  Yeah, three minute rounds, I guess.  Is that good?  I don't think we should do more than that.  Two minutes between rounds?  Something like that.  Maybe we should get the guys back in.  I want them to agree to everything.  And then you and I will be a judge.  Ben, you want to be a judge for this?  Ben will be a judge.  That's all we need is three judges.  I bet someone blasted a fart again in here. 
[01:44:30]  Wow, look what they're doing now, Anthony.  What?  Drinking.  They're just getting comfortable.  Come on, guys.  Come on.  Oh, my.  Now Dave's telling us to wait.  Yeah, he's running the show.  All right, Matt's back in.  There he is.  I'm out of my working clubs and ready to kick some asses.  Oh, yeah.  Got his Florida state shirt on.  Got my Charles, whatever his loser name is.  Dave, man.  Dave's just chugging.  Wow.  Dave, man. 
[01:45:00]  Woof.  Dave, relax.  I'm the J.D., man.  Holy crap.  You know what?  Maybe you're right.  Maybe you're right.  Dave, have another shot.  No, you have another shot.  Come on, man.  You got to be as drunk as me.  I was saying, dude, this guy has drank a lot of Jack on the way here, and he's not even slurring.  Even when he does Imus, he's not slurring.  I'm off the wagon.  You're off the wagon.  Don't fall down just by being drunk.  Yeah.  Hell no, dude.  You do that now?  No.  No.  Good.  I'll take whatever help I can get.  Those are my muscles.  My whiskey muscles. 
[01:45:30]  Whiskey muscles he's pulling out.  I got on the Amtrak.  I am really creeped out about today's event.  It runs itself.  Yes.  I got something I think is funny.  All right.  I got on the Amtrak coming back from Boston, right?  Yeah.  And it's very dark in there, and so I'm completely blind.  So I feel the backrest and seats to see if there's an open seat as I'm going down the  aisle, because I'm too ignorant to ask for help.  And I touch, and there's no one in their seat.  And there's people behind me, and I say, you know, is anyone sitting there? 
[01:46:00]  And these guys go, no.  And this woman apparently had Tourette's.  And I've heard about it, and I've heard it on TV, and this and that.  But so I go, so I stick my cane in, and my cane hits her.  And she goes, ah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  And I jump back into the people behind me and go, ah!  And they're like, and she's going, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  And I'm like, and she's trying not to say the F word. 
[01:46:30]  But it comes out, and she starts screaming it.  And I'm just like, oh, my God.  And she goes, and then she goes, I have Tourette's.  And I knew, and I always thought it was a gag.  But I knew, I sat two seats ahead of her, and the train broke down twice.  Thank you, man, track.  And I knew any time that there was an African-American gentleman coming by us.  No way.  I thought it was a gag. 
[01:47:00]  But for God's sakes, every time someone African-American descent came by, she started going,  Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.  No way.  I swear to God.  And I'm two seats ahead of her.  And people are like, oh, that's horrible.  And I'm like laughing uncontrollably, trying to hold my mouth laughing.  You know, I told one of my friends, I was like, I really saw one of those Tourette's people.  You know, I was like, well, I didn't see him.  I heard her. 
[01:47:30]  And he's like, and he goes, man, that's bad.  You shouldn't be laughing at that.  Look at what's happening to you.  You shouldn't be laughing at other people.  And I said, well, you know, my theory, hey, if you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of other people.  You know, but it was, it was funny.  And there was a couple of African-American gentlemen who were very peeved.  I guess.  And she was yelling throughout the car, the N-word, going, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick. 
[01:48:00]  And then it would just come out to full-blown, you better just wear like one of those ball-in-the-mouth things wherever you go to keep you out of trouble if you got that problem working for you.  Wow.  And the most common question asked by people who used to see go blind by their friends is, how do you know when you're done wiping?  You know, there's a guy in the line, and I didn't even want to go there.  What's the answer? 
[01:48:30]  I didn't want to go there.  But how do you know?  You just keep wiping.  Right.  See, blind people probably got the cleanest butts around.  They just keep going.  You're all right.  I thought maybe you just smelt it.  That's true, too.  Use your sense to smell it.  No, there's still a little something there.  Charlie.  Yeah, O&A.  What's up?  I wonder if you guys are going to do this a la Hear No Evil, See No Evil, where each one of you guys get on their shoulders and tell them what time to hit them at.  12 o'clock, 1 o'clock. 
[01:49:00]  No, it's it.  They're going to have bells.  As Steven said, if we wait until 12 or 1 o'clock, we'll be here all night.  Right.  Are you on the Prozac or the Zola?  Yeah, how are you going to do in the fighting?  I hear you were almost taking the Zola.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was on, they gave me a Paxil.  They gave you Paxil instead?  Yeah, it was like, what an insane.  Is that how blindness gives me something? 
[01:49:30]  See, for the, I went like insane.  Holy smokes.  Did you?  I went back to the doctor and I had a bag full of these boxes and I threw them at him.  He goes, how'd that work out?  I was like, well, I wound up in a hospital in Lowell, Massachusetts.  I thought I was going to die.  And he's like, oh, so those weren't working out.  I went to see the guy this morning.  A month and a half ago, I went on the wagon, which I'm obviously off.  Dr. Robin, if you're listening, this is just a radio gag.  And he thought I was on Paxil all this time. 
[01:50:00]  And I was like, no, you moron.  He goes, well, that's why I was so afraid to give you the Xanax.  And I was like, give me the Xanax.  Yeah.  You should have been on the Zoloft, though, and then come off and fight.  I'm on the Xanax, so I don't kill you all.  Frank, what's going on?  But that's to deal with the blindness.  Hey, Frank.  Hey, guys, this is wrong.  You're crossing the line.  I mean, which next? 
[01:50:30]  Hemophiliac knife fighting?  Shut up, Frank.  Hemophiliac knife fighting.  Nice.  Frank, shut up.  Do they have AIDS as well or just don't kill out?  That's fine, Matt.  I have to ask both of you.  You guys are completely cool with this.  No, I'm very offended.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  So I figure if I go in and punch Matt in the uterus and bite his ears off, because I have been prepared for the fight by going off the Zoloft for a couple of days. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, so the I missed, Dave.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I lost my big fat cowboy hat.  Blind Steve's on the line.  Blind Steve.  Steven.  Matt, you've got to do it up for this.  You pussy.  What up, baby?  Yeah.  This is the guy that Dave was supposed to fight originally.  Get up, Steve.  Just do what I told you. 
[01:51:30]  I'm going to do what you told me, coach.  Oh.  Let's get the games going.  You're wasting time.  There's a nice guy that, so it's going to be hard to get to win everything I got, but I'm going to give it.  Bye.  Steve, like the Pink Floyd song, Wish You Were Here.  Mike.  Yeah, yeah.  Turn the radio down.  Turn the radio down.  What's up?  We've got blind Matt and blind Dave in the studio.  Dude, I'm telling you what.  This is the funniest stuff I've ever heard.  I'm holding it down here in Columbus.  I'm driving my truck around.  I've never laughed out loud at anything on the radio in my life before.  You guys are rocking. 
[01:52:00]  I love it.  Look at that, Columbus.  Hey, Mike, I'll be in Columbus this weekend.  If you want to come down to say hello.  Where are you going to be?  Wait, where are you going to be in Columbus?  We're going to be at some hotel.  He doesn't have to know.  Why are you going to be in Columbus?  Steve and I play on a team called the Long Island Bombers, which is a blind game of baseball for folks who are blind.  Well, yeah, blind game of baseball.  Blind baseball.  It's a modified game of baseball that we play.  We're coming out there to have a tournament against a lot of other blind teams. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  Oh, cool.  So we'll be out there.  We'll be flying out tomorrow.  We'll be in Columbus Saturday and Sunday.  Come on down, and I will not take my eye out for you.  All right.  Wow.  But, you know, it's something.  You know, we were thinking a couple years ago, a challenge in O&A to a game.  We realize you guys may be big time for us, but if you guys ever consider it, man, we'd love to play.  We'll just drink until we're blind, and then we'll lose.  That's it.  I got a 135 average in the bowling.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I just started, like, a month ago, man.  Really?  You know what?  I think I could do that. 
[01:53:00]  And they said...  You just feel where the gutters are.  You walk up to the line, you feel where the gutters are with your feet, and you get in the  middle and heave the ball, you know?  And you got a 135 average, and there's no...  I got, like, four strikes in one game.  And there's no work in my lane.  And the pins aren't...  Exactly.  The pins aren't beeping or anything.  They ask you in Massachusetts, there's a lot of blind people.  It's like the blind state in Massachusetts.  They're like...  They're like... 
[01:53:30]  Would you, like, lane with bumpers?  Bumper lane.  What the hell in a bumpers?  And they're like...  Um, so, when your blind ass throws the ball down the thing, it won't bother anyone else  and go into their lane.  I'm like, nah.  I think I'll just take a break.  Now, my bowling technique is to squat, put the ball between my legs, and push it like  a sissy.  That's it.  All right?  These guys...  That's like someone letting you push the gas pedal on their car and say you're driving,  you know?  It ain't real, man, you know? 
[01:54:00]  Frank from...  I drive a dirt bike, man.  My friend's 250 Enduro.  I feel with my left foot and my right foot, I get in the middle of his dirt road.  I lay it out through first, pop second, and hit the...  Third, and they'd come up to an abrupt stop and feel that, damn, that tree would have  hurt.  You know what?  You know what I think?  I hope that the listeners...  It's extreme.  I hope I think...  You gotta live.  I think the listeners should get from this that, you know, while we're sitting here spoofing  on our blindness a little bit and I'm popping my eye out for the show, which is something 
[01:54:30]  I haven't done since I'm like 16.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Well, that's fine.  That's about the mindset of this show.  Yeah, that's where we're at mentally, man.  You know what, guys?  The real message is, as blind folks, we do everything and anything, including popping  our eyes out for a little fun.  No, let me tell you one thing.  No, it probably should be retarded.  I'm sure not getting on a bike and blindfolding myself and popping third gear.  You know...  That's great, though, man.  My friend's father never knew I was riding a bike up at his house in the country, you  know, like in upstate Connecticut, the country. 
[01:55:00]  And there's a little open doorway and I hit third gear and accidentally popped a wheelie,  almost had a heart attack, and like went up for like two seconds, and instead of like  letting off the throttle, I laid down on the bike.  And my friend's father's like, geez, if I didn't know any better, I'd swear that was  like Pace driving by and riding a wheelie.  And he was like, oh, that was Pace.  Why?  And he's riding by doing a wheelie.  And his friend's like, you know, how do you do that? 
[01:55:30]  I'm like, well, you never lose it, dude.  And I'm like, nah, I just scared the crap out of myself.  I don't know what the hell I'm doing, you know?  Frank, Frank from New York quickly wants to know, he says that Matt plays for a blind  baseball team.  He wants to know if it's the New York Mets.  Oh, hold on.  Why?  Frank, we beat them.  They're terrible.  In my travels of Boston, I can tell you one thing.  Never, even if you're blind and you have a cane and people feel sorry for you, never be in 
[01:56:00]  a sports bar and say the Red Sox suck.  Because they will beat the crap out of you and lynch you.  I'll tell you the funniest thing.  Go Sox!  Cancel your appointments!  Psycho Mark wants to get paid now for that.  I'll tell you what the funniest thing for a blind guy to do in a bar is, and that's to  say, hey, I'm blind.  Give me the darts.  Everyone does.  Got some house darts.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Hey, how about next week on ONA? 
[01:56:30]  Pregnant woman kickboxing.  Pregnant woman kickboxing.  Write that down, Ant.  That's nice.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, okay.  I feel good about this now.  You feeling better about it, guys?  Should we get a little hate going?  What do you mean?  I don't know.  Shouldn't we hate each other or something?  Oh, no.  Don't start bad-mouthing each other.  I'm kidding.  It's like, as the bottle turns, so does Dave's frustrated anger towards Matt. 
[01:57:00]  You should let Matt feel the JD bottle to see how much Dave just drank.  Outside, he says, blind guys know the shape of every liquor bottle out there.  That's it, baby.  I've been on the wagon for like a month and a half, and two days ago, I thought I was coming  here, and I bought 10 shooters of Jack Daniels, and I put them in my little fridge.  I have a refrigerator in my room, because that's what a beer drinker I was. 
[01:57:30]  If you need it.  Now we switch to Jack.  And it was like, okay, I'll wait till tomorrow or the next day when I go on the show.  That's when I'm going to go off the wagon.  You're getting all itchy because you knew they were there.  And I heard this little, hey, come on, we're in here.  Come on.  Come on.  You know you.  You know you want it.  You know you want it.  And then I heard a little clamoring around.  You know, like I went to the blind school. 
[01:58:00]  I came home.  My parents had kittens.  It was like having the gremlins in your house.  And I was like, I hear this little creaking around and things knocking over.  I'm like, what the hell is that?  Like gremlins.  Yeah.  And that's why I called them.  I was like, I came back.  I was like, you got gremlins in my house.  What the hell is this?  Classic.  But the little booze bottle, so two days ago.  So if we had to fight yesterday, I would have been beaten miserably.  You should have fought yesterday.  And right now I'm borderlining on being so drunk that it's going to be really rough for me. 
[01:58:30]  All right, so I'm going to lay off Jack Daniels for a while.  Well, we're going to take a break, Ant, and we're going to do blind boxing.  Yes, when we come back, we will do blind boxing.  We definitely won't stall.  None of that crap.  Are those the bells?  I've been waiting, man, since 1 o'clock.  Blind Matt and Blind Dave will finally get it on.  And already.  All right.  Oh, we're going to do.  It's going to be a blind your face match.  We want to do three rounds, two minutes. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, we never discuss that.  Three two-minute rounds of maybe a couple-minute break in between rounds.  How about four rounds?  Holy mackerel.  We can do that.  And how's the falls go?  How's that go?  Well, we don't know if either one of you are going to fall down.  Dave, I think they, from just my suspicion, Dave, they don't think we're going to hit each other.  Let's make a bloody mess with each other for these guys.  No, I think we have a...  I'm going to hit you, just I'm going to feel bad about it. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Me too.  Three fall, three fall down rule?  Yeah.  So if you fall down three times and one round, the fight's over.  But if you fall down just from drunkenness, then it don't count.  No, it'll be deemed a slip.  Do we get coaches like, kid, like, one of you guys...  I want Opie in my corner.  Oh, that's what's going to happen.  We'll be in each corner.  Yeah.  I'll do the opposite of whatever you tell me.  No, but you know what?  Wait.  I want quiet when we're boxing, other than the announcer who's calling the blows, or this and that.  Because the more someone's yelling out right, left, the more that's giving it away to the 
[02:00:00]  other guy.  I want to be sneaky.  All right.  So we'll put bells on you guys.  We'll be quiet.  No, no bells.  No bells?  You have to have bells.  You don't want bells, old man?  You don't want bells?  How are you going to find the other guy?  Y'all see.  And we won't.  It's old bitch, Sam, Opie.  I've been working on this for two years.  All right.  I'm really 20-20 vision.  All right.  Let's...  Dr. Philotoff, diamond vision. 
[02:00:30]  The blind guy is doing a diamond vision.  Jesus Christ now.  Or Papa Pio.  Dr. Philotoff is not Jesus Christ.  Wow.  All right.  When we get back, it's...  These guys going at it.  Tell your friends.  Andre Philotoff.  It's the PBA on ONA.  Call your friends right now.  It's blind boxing on the Opie and Anthony.  It's blind boxing.  Call your friends.  And go tell my family.  Minutes away, Anthony.  All right.  And I just got to tell people, once again, really fast, the picture of blind Matt when  he popped his eye out. 
[02:01:00]  His fake eye is on WNEW.com.  Check that out.  And they haven't asked for a picture of my helmet yet, but we're working on that.  Blind Matt overshadowing blind, Dave.  No, you got...  No.  Who would have thought there was all those guys named Blind Dave, though?  What was up with that yesterday?  I'm listening to the radio on here, and we got Blind Dave online.  And I'm like, that's not me.  Don't name your kid Dave.  All right.  We got to find a place for the dog.  Yeah.  We get to put him in Steve's office.  I can leave him in here or in Steve's office. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I'm not getting bit.  Put him in Steve's office, though.  He can't even see through the glass.  Are we still on the air?  Yeah.  We promise when we get back, the boxing will start up.  Okay?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Oh, no.  You're on the air.  Everything you say to me.  I'm a mother play.  I need a little room to play.  I'm a mother play.  It's the O.A. Show. 
[02:02:00]  Wow.  K-Rock played Lincoln Park at 2.58 today.  Yeah.  A lot of people laughing out there.  Put the pieces of the puzzle together.  You'll get it.  877-692-1027.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Well, we have blind boxing.  Ben, you got to tell Ant what you just told me.  Listen to this.  This is kind of funny.  It really is.  I had an observation. 
[02:02:30]  I went to the bathroom to go to the bathroom, and the whole floor is soaking wet in our bathroom.  It was just everywhere.  Did Dave just get out beforehand?  Yeah, he was right before me.  I was wondering if they were going to ask, you know, whether they need a beeper on the toilet.  That's just funny.  They're getting their stuff on.  We can move outside if you want to.  Yeah, we should do that.  I think they're getting their equipment on right now. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Putting the headgear on and the gloves.  And I don't know what the hell is going to happen here.  We realized we didn't have ropes for the ring.  Right.  Because, you know, we don't have a ring.  We got outside.  And we're going to put a couple of interns there so they could push them back into the hiding area.  Pretty much tell Ant that they're stepping out of the ring.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's go outside.  All right.  You go first.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  Jesus.  I don't know how this is going to play out.  Because they don't want the bells on.  They can't see.  I just picture flailing wildly until someone connects.  I don't really see it.  I don't see it really turning into a boxing match.  Anthony.  You all right there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let me get outside.  Let's get my head off outside.  It's crazy out here.  You don't see your other blind friends running around boxing people. 
[02:04:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Dave.  Dave, come over here.  What's the matter with you?  Dave, over here.  Over here.  You got to do that for the radio.  He's imitating Kevin Meaney, Anthony.  Hold on.  Let me get a mic in front of you.  I'm all tangled up here.  Yeah, that chair has to be moved.  What's the matter?  I can't see my...  I don't know where my cigarette is.  That's not right.  You'll poke your other eye out.  What's the matter with you pulling your eyes out on national internet?  You're like a crazy person.  Popping your eye out. 
[02:04:30]  You're not right.  Look at you pulling your blindfold down.  Yeah, wait a minute.  You got to put your blindfold back on.  See, blind Dave can only see little things alike.  Little shapes.  But he sees a little bit.  And he wants to be fair to blind Matt.  He's completely blind.  Matt's completely...  He's bring the dog in blind.  I've got to take this off.  I've got to fix this.  All right, hold on.  Stinky.  What's the matter with you?  You're screwed at all.  Okay.  You're not right. 
[02:05:00]  What's the matter?  You don't see your other blind friends going on radio stations boxing.  Making a fool of yourself.  You're like a crazy person, aren't you?  You're just crazy.  I know.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Are you taking all this in?  This is some of the best video I have ever, ever taped in two and a half years.  This is priceless.  What does he say?  I heard the hammered statement.  Blind people can hear.  We're not retards. 
[02:05:30]  That's right.  We're not retarded.  Hey, I need a piece of paper because I'm one of the judges.  Ben's one of the judges.  Where's Ben?  Ben can come out here.  Let's run through the rules.  Yeah.  We're going to do three two-minute rounds.  Correct.  And there's a three-knockdown rule.  If someone gets knocked down three times in one round, the fight's over.  A slip will be deemed a slip, not a knockdown.  There might be a couple of those.  We'll judge this on the ten-point must system. 
[02:06:00]  The winner of each round getting ten points.  The loser, you can give them seven, eight, or nine points.  And I don't know if it's going to go that way.  I think it's just going to be flailing until someone gets hit and knocked out.  I can't see this working any other way.  And they want to do four rounds in.  What, you guys want to do four rounds?  How many rounds do you want to do, guys?  It's going to take a little endurance as he's puffing on his butt.  Three, two, four.  What's the matter with you?  I don't have a cigarette in my mouth. 
[02:06:30]  Wait a minute.  You're going to be boxing in a second.  You can't have a cigarette in your mouth as you box.  When you're boxing, the Jack Daniels, the butts, he's ready to rock.  I like it.  You're off.  You're, you're whacked out, aren't you?  All right.  Hey, Stinky, let's talk to Matt.  Matt, you ready to go?  I'm ready, baby.  You look good.  Ready to rock.  You look really good.  I got my foam face working. 
[02:07:00]  I see that.  Yeah, we got the headgear on them.  Real boxing gloves.  Now, Matt, are you going to close your eyes during this?  Because you don't need them.  But if he hits you hard, I don't want one of those eyes flying out.  Well, if it flies out, pick it up for me.  He has two prosthetic eyes.  So he completely can't see.  Go to WNEW.com if you think we're lying.  There's a picture of him with his eye popped out.  I've been smacked about the head plenty of times and the eyes stayed in.  Oh, really?  Okay.  So there's no threat of those things flying out of your head.  Hey, guys, I got a good idea. 
[02:07:30]  Why don't we get the mic cords out of the ring so the guys don't trip?  These are for white men with small penises.  These are too small.  He's hammered, man.  That's a big boxing glove.  You've got to be hammered.  I saw so much Jack Daniels being swigged.  I've got a high tolerance.  What's the matter with you?  I'm an alcoholic.  I can drink bottles of Jack Daniels.  You know, Dave, he can smoke with boxing gloves, too.  That's amazing.  Dave, you need to smoke as you do this just to answer it. 
[02:08:00]  No, what are you crazy?  He's too good, man.  Why would not?  All right.  I've got to be smoking.  He can smoke a cigarette, and then when he gets punched in the face and it gets broken,  he'll really get pissed.  All right.  Are we ready to do this?  All right.  Let's guide the combatants into the ring.  Wait, there's no strap for my gloves.  There's no, there are no straps.  What do you mean there's no, they're supposed to be?  No, there's no strap.  They have bells on one hand.  I can't even make a fist with these.  So when they swing that right hand, you're going to hear the tinkling of the bells. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  No, there's no straps.  You just hold tight with a fist.  They're walking Matt around the ring, so he gets kind of a feel for what it's all about.  The ring's about, we should be pretty accurate, actually, for these guys.  What would you say, Ann?  10 by 10?  10 by 10 is a good guess.  You're the timekeeper.  Dave's doing a little practice punching.  Move your hand, Stink.  Shadow box.  Oh!  You punch a stinky in the stomach. 
[02:09:00]  He's got a good sense of where someone is, even if he's a...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Even though he can't see.  He can hear very well, isn't he?  Walk Dave around the ring so he gets a feel for, you know, the size of the ring and stuff.  Dave, it's 10 by 10.  Wait a minute.  Maybe I shouldn't have a cigarette.  Yeah, maybe you should put that down.  Take the cigarette out of his mouth.  Now let's guide him around the ring.  I just would like to say that I have gone off the Zoloft.  In preparation for a fight. 
[02:09:30]  Pete the Engineer is horrified.  I don't think he wants this to go down.  We're getting more and more spectators down here.  Well, what I'd say is I'm used to smacking my women about their head and face.  Matt Doe and Sean Connery.  I'll smack that bitch, show it.  All right, they are each at a corner right now.  And I don't even know how this is going to work.  I don't know.  I think there's a better chance of someone, again, the crowd getting punched.  Where am I heading towards, though? 
[02:10:00]  You're just...  Yeah, but you're not telling me where I'm going in the ring.  You're going to go straight.  That's just the perimeter of the ring.  Put him in the corner, face him in the right direction, and let's get down to a brass taxi.  Let me see.  Okay.  All right, you got...  They're feeling each other out here.  All right, hold on.  Seeing how tall each other is.  It kind of...  Okay.  All right.  All right, let's get to the corners.  Yeah, Dave.  F you with the gays, Dave.  Dave, get to your corner.  I'm supposed to see it.  This is so...  You know what?  This is so wrong. 
[02:10:30]  It is.  One game is completely hammered.  We got to take the cigarette out of his mouth.  I'm not completely hammered.  All right, Dave, get into your corner.  I think he's got the field mic, so hopefully we'll be able to hear some of this.  All right, if someone could grab the bell from in front of my little workstation over there.  Anthony, when you ring the bell, you tend to go ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Do we start fighting after the last...  No, the second you hear a ding, you just go.  Okay.  That's what it's all about.  We need someone on this side of the ring so you can tell them that they're out of the ring.  Hang back. 
[02:11:00]  Harry, get over here.  I would rather us start...  No, no shaking hands, but tag gloves so we both know where each other are.  Yeah, all right.  Move to center ring.  Have the bell ring.  Move to center ring.  Are you okay with that?  I'm okay with that.  All right, move Matt forward to Dave.  Are you guys going to back up into your corner after you touch gloves?  Yeah, I don't know where you are.  After we touch, I'm right here.  All right.  There they are.  All right.  I'm going to cut it.  So wait, no.  Dave is saying he wants us to touch gloves and then...  No, right when the bell rings, you're going to start punching?  No.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:11:30]  No, back up.  Back up.  You've got to find each other.  The ick to them is us missing.  No, it's not.  No.  I got this bagged.  No, no, no.  We just want...  Oh, my God.  We just want you backed up a little.  Yeah, back up to the corner.  Seriously.  Back up to the corner.  I want to know where he's at.  All right.  Two-minute rounds?  Yeah, two-minute rounds.  Two-minute rounds.  We might have to take a break, so we've got to get at least one round in before we take a break.  We'll get a round in.  All right.  They're backing back up to the corners.  Yeah, where's the mouthpiece?  I'm down in the corner. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, there's no mouthpiece.  What happened to the mouthpieces?  Oh, you got them?  We got mouthpieces, right?  Me too.  Oh, we got some?  Okay, yeah, they got mouthpieces.  We got mouthpieces.  I don't know why they didn't have them.  That wasn't in Dave Marco's mouth first, was it?  No, these are being taken out of the package right now.  All right.  Everyone be quiet so I can talk to these guys really fast.  You're about...  Dave, Dave, you're about 10 feet away from Matt in the opposite corner, and Matt, of course,  10 feet from Dave.  All right.  Mouthpieces going in. 
[02:12:30]  There they go.  Oh, my God.  All right.  He's burping.  Andy, get him face the right way.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Okay, you guys ready?  Get out of the ring.  It's going to be four rounds.  All right.  Ready for blind boxing.  When you guys hear, the bell will start.  I can't believe this.  Here we go.  They're facing each other in the corner.  And let's get ready to blind rumble.  There they go. 
[02:13:00]  They're right in front of each other, and they don't know it.  They have no clue where each other is.  Someone's going to get...  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  Here they go.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're on the ring.  Hold on.  We're on the ring.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Matt knocked down Dave.  Matt knocked down Dave.  Dave went down hard.  I'm not sure if it was a push.  I'm not sure if it was a push.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Back to neutral corners.  Dave, how are you feeling? 
[02:13:30]  That hurt.  Oh, he played like he ain't going to hurt.  All right.  Now I'm ready to go.  38 seconds.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm angry.  38 seconds of the first round.  38 seconds in.  We have a knockdown.  All right.  So, Matt knocked down.  That's one knockdown for Dave.  It's a three knockdown rule.  All right.  Are we ready?  Let's resume the round.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  A little over a minute left in the round.  There they go.  They're looking at each other.  Oh.  Matt connected with Dave connected with the right.  Dave is now swinging.  Oh, wow. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  They got him.  All right.  They're swinging like crazy.  This has got really real.  They're in a clinch now.  All right.  All right.  They're out of the ring.  All right.  They're out of the ring.  They're out of the ring.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  They're fighting after the bell.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  These two are out for blood.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rick is down.  Rick got punched in the face.  A lot of people got punched in the face.  Rick got punched in the face.  All right.  Break him up. 
[02:14:30]  Hold on.  Talk to Dave.  What's he talking about?  Talk to Dave.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave.  I just got body blowed.  My ribs are killing me, man.  Wait a minute.  Rick got knocked down.  What?  What happened?  See, you guys...  What happened?  He wants to know what happened.  You guys got to understand, when someone yells, break, you got to stop punching and  step away.  He was still at me.  I'm not going to say I'm getting it.  I guess we didn't spell that out.  When we yell, break, it means you guys are so far out of the ring... 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, well, I heard, break, and he was still hitting me in the ribs, man.  All right.  Well, when we say break, you guys got to stop punching immediately and just break.  Rick, give Rick the mic.  Rick, what happened?  As I'm trying to angle for a great camera shot, I get an errant elbow from Blind Dave  as he's winding up backwards to try and hit Matt.  It got you in the mouth?  He got me right in the jaw.  You almost knocked Rick out.  And my head hurts now. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Sorry.  Stinky, let's talk to Matt.  I'm sorry.  Matt, how are you feeling so far?  Good.  Okay.  Matt's feeling good.  Yeah, Matt.  All right, listen.  How many seconds left in the first round?  Yeah.  We're up to a minute 12.  Minute 12 in the first round.  All right.  A minute 12.  We got 47 seconds.  After what we have seen, we've got to do only three rounds.  Three two-minute rounds is plenty.  All right.  We have a few more seconds.  Remember, guys, when we yell break, you got to break.  Yeah.  Two-minute rounds are, you know, three-minute, what are they, two-minute rounds? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  We're just about done with the first round.  We got 48 seconds, I think, left in the first round.  And we're ready.  We're ready.  On top of the head, I think I was reborn.  Okay.  We're ready to.  Hold on.  Okay.  Dave's fixing his equipment.  Get it.  And we're ready to resume.  Hold on.  Yep.  They're fixing their equipment.  What happened to your mouthpiece?  Yeah.  All right, Dave.  Oh, he put it in his pocket.  You put it in your pocket, I think, Dave.  They have bells on their right glove, by the way.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  The best part is when they're standing right in front of each other, but no one's punching 
[02:16:30]  yet.  And it's like, oh, my God, he's right in front of them.  What do you mean no one's punching?  He punched my ribs in.  No, I mean, when you guys square off, you were standing at one point right in front  of each other, but you're just kind of moving around and not knowing that you're right in  front of each other.  If one person just would have thrown a punch, it would have been over.  I'm in shock.  It's a very clinch fight.  It's reminiscent of the Ali Frazier fights.  A lot of clinching.  All right.  Here we go.  The last 48 seconds of the first round, hopefully.  All right.  Are we ready? 
[02:17:00]  We're in position.  Guys in the corner.  You're facing the right direction.  And let's go.  There they go.  They're back in.  Oh, they're running in.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no.  He's still going.  Okay.  They're going to fight their way out of it.  Still going.  They're fighting.  Fighting out of it.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  All right.  They were out of the ring.  Wow.  What a flurry of blows that was. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Listen.  I just got.  Blind gave work in the body.  I just got punched in the nut.  Oh, God.  Opie got punched in the sack.  Oh, my God.  Opie's down.  Opie got punched in the yam bag.  I knew these guys would be punching everybody.  They can't see.  They're just throwing punches.  Opie, what do you expect?  You are ringside.  I was in shock.  I'm like, oh, they see I'm here. 
[02:18:00]  And I'm like, no, they don't.  No, they don't.  They're just punching.  Is that the end of the.  No.  We still have 28 seconds left.  28 seconds left in the first round.  Oh, my God.  At this rate.  We can all agree that that's the end of the first round.  All right.  You want to end the first round?  We're going to end the first round.  We'll take a break.  We'll come back with round two of blind boxing.  Wait.  How do they feel?  We should talk to them real fast.  How are you feeling after that?  How's it going so far?  Good.  A little windy.  A little windy.  Quite the flurry. 
[02:18:30]  Furious pace.  Yeah.  He's got good reach.  Good on the inside.  Dave was working.  And he's getting you in the nuts.  He was working the midsection on you.  I saw that happening.  Dave did a great job on the midsection.  You're more of a headhunter.  Matt's more of a headhunter.  Dave.  You did a good job on the.  I don't know.  He hit my ribs in like hell, man.  Because you were working his midsection pretty good.  Are you hurting?  You think you're going to be able.  I don't know why I was hitting him.  Are you going to be able to continue for round two?  Yeah.  I'm hurt.  But I'm going.  All right. 
[02:19:00]  We'll have to continue with round two after we take a break, I guess.  And these guys can rest up.  Now it's personal.  He's yelling at it.  All right.  We'll be back with blind boxing on the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right. 
[02:19:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show outside the studio.  We're in the middle of blind boxing.  Unbelievable.  I am stupefied today.  Yeah.  I don't know what to say.  What a display of athleticism that we have seen here so far.  And it's only round one, the end of round one. 
[02:20:00]  We will start up round two.  I forgot my bell again.  Well, they're getting their gloves back on, Anthony.  Yeah.  Getting ready.  I think they've assessed what they did and maybe didn't do in the first round.  They're reassessing themselves.  And they'll come out with a new strategy, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although Matt's been pretty effective.  Matt's been very effective.  I think Dave is...  Dave has figured out what he was doing wrong and he's ready to go. 
[02:20:30]  One thing he did wrong was punch everyone except Matt.  So, so far he's hit Rick in the chin and Opie in the yam bag.  In the right nut.  And you went down, man.  You were on the floor.  And that's good entertainment, isn't it?  Yeah, it's great.  No, we don't want to tell anyone who's winning the fight yet.  And I do have the scorecards ready.  And Ben, the judges of Blind Boxing.  Now remember, guys, when I yell break, you guys got to stop punching and break. 
[02:21:00]  And everyone else just be quiet, okay?  Well, cheer on.  Okay, all right.  Steve is videotaping this mess.  Yeah.  I hope my mom's not listening today.  Are we all set and ready for round two of Blind Boxing?  You guys ready?  Ready, guys?  Yep.  All right.  Okay, here we go, Ann.  On your bell.  And they're off.  There they go. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  It's turning toward the center of the ring.  It's always quiet at first.  It's very quiet at first until they realize.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they get so close.  No, no, that's not.  They get so close.  Dave is punching the air.  Dave is punching right in front of them.  Don't even say what they are.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  This is the one.  This is the one.  Oh, no.  And they got each other.  All right, hold on.  Break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break.  They ran right out of the ring.  Okay.  Ran right out of the ring. 
[02:22:00]  25 seconds.  25 seconds.  It is really funny, Anthony.  What's going on here is they don't know where each other is.  And one will just start taking a stab at the air.  And Matt hit Dave's back.  And then they know where each other is.  And then it's an all-out fight from there.  The funniest thing is when they were both facing the same direction.  Yeah.  Like, usually boxes are face-to-face.  They were next to each other, facing the same direction.  That was very interesting.  Wow.  What happened?  Oh, what?  Yeah, you guys, very important. 
[02:22:30]  You've got to just break when you hear break.  Yeah, but if you're still getting punched, you've got to punch back.  All right.  Well, let's just break.  We need a brave ref that's going to jump in between these guys and break them up.  All right.  There you go.  We got one.  Steve C., you're videotaping all this?  Yeah.  Very good.  Check it out on FoundryMusic.com.  All right.  We all ready to resume the round?  Yes.  We only went 25 seconds.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  Try not to wrestle so much, guys. 
[02:23:00]  You can't take down the legs or anything.  Boxing.  Blind boxing.  Here we go.  Ready?  No cheating.  As far as the guys on the outside of the ring telling them where they're at.  All right.  Here we go.  There's the bell.  There's the bell.  Oh, yeah.  Break, break, break, break.  Charge.  Break, break, break.  Wow.  Hard to break these guys off.  Chill, chill, chill.  Hold on, Dave.  Hold on, Dave.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:30]  Now it is getting personal.  Okay, let's get Matt and Dave back in the corner.  Like a bunch of gangsters.  All right, let's get the head kick back to this.  You know what?  Let's get rid of these bells.  Yeah, take the bells off.  Take the goddamn bells off.  This will be the last section of round two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll let the bells off.  All right, the bells are off.  All right.  Wow.  All right, this is going to be the last section of round two.  Matt, you all right over there?  We haven't talked to Matt in a while.  Just fine.  Just fine?  Doing good?  Let's do this.  Let's break clean when you guys get out of the ring. 
[02:24:00]  And let's finish this.  All right, the glove's going back on Dave right now.  Back into the corner.  Guys are getting into position.  And we'll resume round two.  Holy smoke.  These guys, what it is, is they rush each other when they finally realize where they are.  And it turns into just a pushing match.  We don't have much room here.  So, guys, you're going to have to do the stick and move thing.  Try to keep the clinching to a minimum.  All right?  Are we ready?  Each corner ready?  All right?  Mm-hmm.  And there's the bell.  There they go. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  More punching.  Here we go.  It's okay.  Brick!  Brick!  Brick!  Brick!  Wow.  Out of the ring again.  Dave lost his headgear, but he came on really strong there.  Dave comes charging out of the corner.  Charging.  Found Matt.  Popped him a few times.  And Matt retaliated.  Yeah, but I didn't go down until after a break.  It's okay.  Yeah, he's using the wrestling moves.  And your headgear was knocked off.  That is the end of round two, Andy.  Yeah, that will be the end of round two.  We will have the third and final round. 
[02:25:00]  Let's see if Matt's okay.  Matt, are you all right?  I'm beautiful.  Wait.  Let's think.  Get Matt to mic.  You got the mic now, Matt.  You all right?  I'm beautiful.  A little hot.  Put the headgear off.  The gloves off.  Okay.  Ready to rock.  All right.  Dave, let me tell you guys.  In the audience, y'all can't see this.  Dave is coming on like thunder.  Yeah, he comes running out of it.  He's got his balls.  It's like the Tyson.  He's got Jack Daniels buzz working.  He's got them bear muscles flowing.  And he's looking to behead me.  All right. 
[02:25:30]  And tell me it's raining out there, tough guy.  Very good.  Dave, nice finish to the second round there.  We're going to take a break.  And we're going to finish blind boxing with blind Matt and blind David in just a few minutes.  Stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  West Coast Dave checking in again. 
[02:26:00]  Down goes Opie.  Down goes Opie.  Down goes Opie.  Beaten by a blind guy with a punch to the nuts.  Hey, that was a great shot, Dave.  I won't forget that anytime soon.  I apologize.  No, don't apologize.  Yeah, take the cigarette out of your mouth.  We're ready for round three.  Ready for round three.  If you're just tuning in, this is blind boxing, Anthony.  Yes.  Blind boxing.  We're in round three.  We're trying to get them to their corners, Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  Here we go.  They're back in the corners.  Remember, guys, when you hear break, break.  All the people standing ringside try to keep them away from falling on things.  Yeah, because Dave went flying over that couch before, man.  Yeah.  I don't mean to laugh.  That was just...  Like I said, I'm stupefied.  Are we ready for round three?  Guys, are we ready?  Ready.  Ready.  Okay, here we go.  Blind boxing.  Matt to my left.  Dave to my right.  The round has begun. 
[02:27:00]  Don't say anything.  Yeah, don't describe what they're doing.  Okay, hard to do that.  They're kind of trying...  They're feeling where the other guy is.  Oh, oh, okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  There's a lot more body blows happening.  Lots of body blows.  Oh, someone got hit in the nuts.  Oh, there's some serious body blows going on.  Dave, and Matt.  Dave is down.  And down, down.  Okay, break, break, break, break.  Oh, my God.  Okay, okay.  You guys are separated.  Dave, you can't kick.  He's blind. 
[02:27:30]  Is Dave all right?  Hold on.  Dave might be out of the fight.  Dave?  What happened, Dave?  Oh, no.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Did you get a nut shot in there?  Dave took one to the nut.  Let's just put it there.  Oh, damn, a low blow.  I'm sure he didn't mean it.  Matt is saying he didn't mean it, Dave.  Is that correct?  Yeah, kind of hard to see where you're punching.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Now, what's going on here?  Yeah.  When we say break, there's guys grabbing each fighter, and the fighters don't know that 
[02:28:00]  it's not the other boxer, so they just keep swaying it.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  I heard break, and I thought we had an agreement not to keep hitting each other, and I heard  break.  You were punching me in the ribs.  Come on.  You hit me in the same spot of the ribs every time, man.  Matt?  Are you hitting after the bell?  No.  Watch.  See, yes.  See, I think, I hope he's right.  I think they're getting confused.  When we yell break, everyone steps in, and you're still feeling hands on you, and I think, 
[02:28:30]  uh...  You think it's the other fighter?  Oh, man.  Dave, it...  I hope you know how you feel.  Hey, Dave, I don't know if, uh, you can continue.  Can you continue?  I can continue.  You sure?  You can?  Oh, you think I'm going to quit now?  All right.  No way.  All right.  We're going to have to, um, deduct a point for the, uh, low blow.  Oh.  We're going to have to.  Oh, wow.  The only way to make sure the judges have that, we've got to deduct a point for the low blow.  Well, we have to.  Shut up.  You're supposed to be my friend. 
[02:29:00]  You're your old friend, man.  You can't see what you're doing, dude.  Wait a minute.  He's blind.  All right.  We've told him he punched me in the nuts.  You felt it.  He didn't see it.  All right.  Wait, Dave, Dave, do you want us to, uh, deduct a point for getting, uh, the nuts?  No, that's not fair.  Go ahead.  Your friend, I'm losing miserably anyway, so what difference should it be?  Your friend is saying it's unfair.  It's up to you, though.  The point.  What does Dave's friend think?  I don't think it should be deducted.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's. 
[02:29:30]  Come on, Dave.  All right.  Hey, hey.  I'm overruled.  I'm just, I'm being unbiased and I'm just.  All right.  Let's get, let's get back into the corners.  All right.  There's two more sections left to this round.  Yeah.  I think we're working it when we have to yell break three times.  That's when the round's over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because this, it's getting crazy.  You punched me in the roof after stuff said, God said.  They're trash talking now, yeah?  What, Matt?  They're trash talking.  Matt?  Should get you a little mad.  Matt, you all right?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Stinky puts the mic in front of his face and doesn't, he doesn't know. 
[02:30:00]  Classicals are in charge.  What type of big ****?  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You can't.  You can't say that.  All right.  The combatants being led back to their corners again.  Yeah.  Um, we have two more little segments of fighting here.  All right.  You guys ready?  Corners ready?  On the bell.  Here we go.  And they're out.  Hey, they're feeling, no, no.  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:30]  No, no.  Um, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, Matt, Matt with the sneak attack from behind.  All right, they're down.  Break, break.  All right, they pull.  There we go.  That was good.  Holy S.  Actually, that time, Dave backed into Matt.  Matt didn't realize.  Because Dave first went after Stinky.  You started throwing punches at Stinky.  Stinky's backing up like, oh, my God, I'm going to get hit.  And then you started backing up again because you realized you came too far.  You backed into Matt, and Matt roundhoused you a little bit.  Anthony. 
[02:31:00]  I need a second.  Any boxer that's been hit from behind.  Well, that's part of blind boxing, I think.  Anthony.  I need a second.  All right, you got the second.  And my heart is in my throat because Dave is kind of searching out Matt.  Dave's gloves were literally six inches from my head.  And I'm like, oh, my God, if he swings down, I'm so mad.  He's just going to punch you in the face.  He's throwing haymakers.  He is throwing.  How do you know he's throwing haymakers?  He's hitting me.  Wait a minute.  How do you know I'm throwing haymakers? 
[02:31:30]  Dave, trust me.  He popped both eyes out two hours ago.  So, all right.  That is the truth.  Possibly seen.  Okay.  This is the last section of the last round of the last fight we ever do as far as blind  guys go.  The last blind boxing you'll ever hear.  Oh, my God.  This could be it.  I've heard.  Yeah.  This is radio history, Anthony.  I've heard back.  Did it?  Where did he clock you?  Did you shoot him pulled your pants?  No, I'm pissed.  Where did he get you?  You're fruity.  Where did he keep getting me? 
[02:32:00]  In the ribs.  In the ribs.  He's working those ribs, man.  Okay.  I don't know the way you were backing up to him.  You should have got it.  He got me all in the substance.  Wow.  Dave, your friend is hilarious.  He's abusing you.  It's the first time you actually see a boxer.  We better really be getting a ride home because after all, you're getting a ride home.  What do you think we're going to do after the show is over?  Just kick you to the curb and say thanks, guys?  Look, this guy's giving me a microphone.  I don't know what the hell he's handing me.  I'm thinking it's my eye goggles here.  All right.  There's your eye goggles.  Well, I don't know that. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  I'm a drunk and blind idiot.  Oh, my God.  Put the crap pound it out of me.  Give me a break, man.  You're holding your own, man.  You rarely see boxers in the defensive stance one behind the other like that.  And then you're backed into Matt.  Dave's friend is going, man, you might as well let him.  We can't even say what he said.  I defy anyone to say that this has never been done.  I've never seen this.  It's the BBA blind boxing alcoholics of O&M. 
[02:33:00]  Now I know why they've never done this on radio before.  Because it is just brutal to watch.  It's beautiful being here, man.  All right.  Here we go.  This is the last section of the last round.  Here we go, guys.  Guys, try to keep it in the ring.  I know that's kind of hard.  But it is the last brawling we're going to be doing.  You guys aren't blind. 
[02:33:30]  Put the headgear on the right way.  Dave getting his headgear put on.  Okay.  Now I had to talk with their mouthpieces in.  All right.  Thank you.  Here it is.  This is it, guys.  This will be the last little brawl that they have.  Dave putting his gloves on now.  Being led back to the corner.  Let's get him back in the corner.  Okay.  Here we go, guys.  This is it.  This is for the marbles.  This is for the title. 
[02:34:00]  Mouthpiece going in.  You guys ready?  Everyone ready?  Ready?  All right.  Here we go.  There it goes.  Whoa, whoa.  Wait.  All right.  Now they're fighting.  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  Keep them in the ring.  We'll explain what happened in a second.  And Dave's down.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That was a slip.  That was a slip.  Dave.  Yeah.  Just get up and continue.  Maybe Dave doesn't want to continue.  No, no, no.  All right.  I think my eyes. 
[02:34:30]  Because that was a slip.  It wasn't really a.  All right.  I got to explain.  Dave went flying right past Matt when they came out of the corners.  And Dave started punching his friend pretty good.  Yeah.  He was beating up his friend.  He knocked a beer out of his friend's hand.  And his friend the whole time is going, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.  Not me.  He did.  He ran at him and just started beating up his friend.  He thought his friend was mad.  Punching the hell out of me, buddy.  All right.  That was a slip.  So we're going to. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  That was a slip.  So we'll go again.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  Get back in your corners.  Fighters ready.  And this is it.  There we go.  We're not going to tell you.  All right.  There.  There.  Okay.  Whoa.  Wow.  They're just kind of swinging.  One of the interns just got knocked down by a haymaker from Dave.  You're in a dangerous place.  Okay.  There they go.  They found each other.  They're fighting.  Don't go into Don and Mike's show. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  They're fighting.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Was that a slip?  Yeah.  It was a slip.  That was a slip?  We've got to finish this, guys.  Oh, my God.  One of the interns got knocked down by a haymaker.  He got knocked right off the couch.  What's scary is these guys feel somebody and they think it's a fire and just go crazy.  Another side note.  You know, Don and Mike are here and they're broadcasting from the other studio.  They're on the air and the fighters went flying through the door.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:36:00]  You had to fight spill into their studio.  Spill into their studio.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, my gosh.  All right.  Are we ready now to finish this up?  Give me a second.  Oh, no.  All right.  You know, Dave, you don't have to continue.  Give away my stuff.  All right.  This will be the last segment.  Slip, fall, knock out, knock down, tumble in, whatever.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Win or lose.  I'd rather get the crap beat out of me here than be a push like Steve and not show up. 
[02:36:30]  No more dress talking.  Yes.  That was the guy that Steve, that Dave was supposed to fight.  They're back in the corners.  All right.  Let's go.  Dave.  All right.  Hold on, Matt.  Hold on.  We said go.  Matt is the consummate professional.  He's the one that's been standing in the corner waiting after every segment.  And Dave takes his stuff off.  Starts talking.  Starts smoking his butt.  The gloves come off.  And Matt just stands there waiting. 
[02:37:00]  Stinky, what did we miss?  They're all laughing.  What happened?  He's got that look in his eyes.  He's got that look in his eyes.  That's the way they made him.  That's the socket look.  All right.  Here we go.  Eye of the tiger.  Eye of the tiger.  All right.  Fighters ready?  Here it is.  The last one.  Go a little further.  This is going to be it, guys.  This is it.  And they're off.  Uh-oh.  That's your friend.  That's your friend.  That's your friend.  That's your friend.  That's your friend.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:37:30]  Good guy.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're back in the ring.  All right.  You're back in the ring now.  Go.  No.  That's stinky.  That's stinky.  Don't punch stinky.  All right.  They're trying to find each other.  They're kind of wandering around the ring.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  As soon as they touch someone, they think it's...  They think it's...  That's all right.  Those are the ropes.  All right.  Okay.  No.  No.  That's stinky.  That's stinky.  Okay.  Holy...  No.  That's opie.  That's opie.  All right.  I already got one.  No, no.  There they go.  They're at it.  They're at it.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  There.  That is it.  That is the end of blind boxing right there.  Oh, my God.  That is the end of blind boxing.  Woo!  What a great last round.  That was an excellent round.  There was a lot of swinging at everybody but the fighters.  That's full lap.  Why?  Because he came in.  Everyone's yelling, go, go, go, pushing me this way and that.  No, because you were punching stinky, opie, and fat guy, and that form of fat guy.  I wanted the round to end.  Start over.  Second's over.  No, no, no. 
[02:38:30]  We are done with blind boxing.  Yeah.  We will now go to the judges.  Get their gear off.  You guys, let's hear it for Matt and Dave.  Come on.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Oh, my God.  What a day for sport.  Get these guys into the studio.  Wow.  And I and Ben are going to go into the studio here and figure out who won that last round there.  We're not taking a break.  We've got to finish the show here.  That was the funniest round yet, opie.  Did you see how long they just went? 
[02:39:00]  You know what?  That is so nerve-wracking because they're just wandering around the ring trying to find each other.  Swinging.  Swinging at everything.  Everything.  I think Rick, no, Rick didn't get punched that time.  Stinky got punched.  Fat guy got punched.  All the other guys got punched.  One of the interns, you see him fly off the chair.  Yeah.  He got in the house.  Bam.  Yeah, we've got to write our scores down.  I'm going to, you can say, they can't hear us. 
[02:39:30]  Let me see.  I'm going to score that one.  You know, I've got to make it a draw.  A draw?  Yeah.  I've got to go a draw on that last round.  It was very even.  You know, you're right about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That third round was a draw.  So we tabulate.  Let's tabulate here.  Do you want them in right now?  Not really.  No, not yet.  We'll tabulate the scores.  Bring them in quickly.  And then decide our winner.  Huh?  God, it is so scary when they're just walking around with their gloves on, their guards 
[02:40:00]  up, and they're just swinging at whoever they come in contact with.  Like they back into somebody and then turn around and take a swing at them.  Okay.  Wait.  Okay.  You need to calculate a rope.  No, no, no, no.  All right?  Oh, wow.  You almost got punched, too, when he was coming at you.  The glove's like six inches away from your face.  Okay.  I got a total.  You got a total?  Let's see. 
[02:40:30]  Let me see the scores.  Wow.  Okay.  Let's bring the guys in.  They're still trash talking out there, Ant.  How do they do it again?  How does the ring announcer do it again?  Well, usually you...  Each round or...  No, how they score the...  How the three judges scored all the rounds.  Right.  What's the score?  Yeah.  Okay.  Matt's in the studio.  His gear is off.  Woo!  I'm sweating.  Dave put up a great fight, guys.  That was entertaining for me.  It was fun.  I'd do it again any time. 
[02:41:00]  You're sweating like crazy.  I'm sweating like crazy.  It was work.  All right.  Dave.  Dave is very winded.  He's on his knees right now.  Dave, you all right?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  He's crying.  Oh, he's trying to get a cigarette.  And you're figuring it out?  How to do it?  Yeah.  I just want to get the final thing.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  For everybody's information, we were drinking Jack Daniels between rounds.  And lots of it.  We got some great, great pictures. 
[02:41:30]  That's a telling shot.  Whoa.  I just broke a camera.  Hold on.  We got great, we got great pictures.  Of neither one of them in the ring.  This is when they were swinging it.  That's what you guys were looking for.  I'm glad you got it.  We have a picture of the ring and where the boxers are supposed to be.  And it's just a picture of a blank ring.  It just fell down.  Yes.  I'm being very quiet now.  I'm turning.  You all right, Dave?  How are your ribs?  A brutal beating.  You all right, though?  A brutal beating?  You backed into a bunch of punches. 
[02:42:00]  I kept getting hit from...  I kept winding up where blind Matt was finding me from behind and getting the body shots in.  And I got to tell you, he got me good.  I'm feeling it.  It hurts to breathe.  I'm guessing a brutal beating was received.  What I'd like to show...  All right, we have two minutes left in the show.  Three rounds.  Let's get to the ring announcer.  Let's get everyone in here for the announcement of the...  The big announcement.  Let's get everyone in the studio that... 
[02:42:30]  It was a good fight, but I lost and I conceded.  It was a great fight.  I bowed to blind Matt.  No, he can't see me bowing, but I bowed to him.  He kicked my butt.  Dave, I'm right behind you.  Don't bend over.  He kicked my butt, but there was no giving off.  All right, okay.  That one, Steve, is still a big butt.  Blind boxing has ended in a decision.  Judge Anthony scores it 30-27.  Judge Opie scores 30-27. 
[02:43:00]  Judge Ben scores 30-25.  And the winner and new champion of blind boxing is Blind Matt.  Woo!  Blind Matt.  I'd like to thank God.  I'd like to thank God right now.  I'd like to thank God for telling me.  I'd like to thank God.  I'd like to thank God again.  And I'd like to thank God again.  God and God.  You guys, we have a minute left in the show.  There's a guy, when he wins, he wins gracefully. 
[02:43:30]  There's a guy, when he gets here, a guy, he winds up, he winds up, he comes behind him, and that's going to be that.  I'd like to say that's hitting from behind.  That's what I'd like to say.  What a brawl.  Look at Dave doing, Frank Kelly, and they're doing John Madden.  John Madden.  I would like to thank Opie and Anthony for having Dave and I on the show.  It was a competitive match.  Dave hit me in the gut a few good times on the top of the head.  Yeah.  And it was just...  When he wins, he wins gracefully.  Hey, man, you want to say hi to anyone? 
[02:44:00]  I just want to send love out to my family, Kendra, Trevor, and Tuscany.  God bless you all, and I know I did this against your wishes.  Sorry to all the other blind people who we made ridicules out of today.  God bless Opie and Anthony for having us.  Thanks, Dave, for putting us on.  Kevin, Dave's friend, for getting us both here.  Thanks to, what was his name, Caro, in the car.  Caro, what's up?  Caro from Vital Transportation.  And, yo, anybody...  1-800-CO-VITAL. 
[02:44:30]  That guy was cool.  That guy was really cool.  As I said earlier today, guys, if anybody's interested in the Long Island Bombers, go to libombers.com.  We're looking for corporate sponsorship and other blind guys to join the team.  We are out of time.  Well, no, we've got to let Dave say something.  Dave, final thoughts?  Tyler Construction, Darien, Connecticut, and above all roofing, Phil Martineau says,  Bart DeTart May is a retard.  All right, and with that, there's really nothing else to say, so we're out of here.
