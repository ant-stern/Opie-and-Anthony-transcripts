<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton, repeatedly announcing the start of the broadcast, preemptively warning listeners of the show's unapologetically crude and offensive nature.  They proudly proclaimed their history of pushing boundaries, promising a barrage of profanity, sexual innuendo ("tits, ass"), and recounted past instances of FCC violations and resulting suspensions.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of a news story about a high-ranking official (implied to be from the IMF) caught soliciting sex from a hotel maid.  The hosts graphically detailed the official's clumsy attempt to escape the hotel, leaving personal items behind, and his near-successful attempt to flee on an Air France flight before being apprehended.  The ensuing conversation was rife with vulgar language and sexually explicit descriptions of the event, punctuated by comparisons to Roman Polanski's efforts to evade extradition.  No other guests were mentioned in this segment of the show.

[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  The control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans. 
[00:03:30]  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect.  This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me!  I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now?  Is it happening?  This is it.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here. 
[00:04:00]  This is different than any other radio show.  Tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio.  It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why this is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement. 
[00:04:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  Hello.  Good fucking morning.  Morning.  World's going to end in five days.  Good morning.  Thank God.  Good morning to you.  What do we got, a week?  Yeah, we got a week of Earth.  Why are we wasting our time then, like, working and coming in early and waking up? 
[00:05:00]  I would think if we have one week left before the end of the world, we should all just, like, take off and be debaucherous.  Rape, pillage, whatever.  Then let's get the hell out of here.  What do you say?  Make believe we're from France for the next five days?  Make believe we're a fucking head muckety-muck.  That guy, what a...  Ah, fuck, I just gave myself hiccups.  What a naughty boy.  What a naughty boy he is.  Who is he?  The International Money Fund head.  Yeah.  Is that a big gig? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I hire the head of the IMF.  Presidential contender there for France.  Yeah, he wants to be president or tried or something.  He wanted to be president.  I don't think that's going to wash too well now.  He was at the Sofitel, $3,000 a night.  Yeah, nice.  And he was chasing a maid around his room with a big boner.  With his boner.  He was chasing it with his bonel.  And it sounds like...  Because they have to write around it in the paper.  Yeah.  But it sounds like he wanted the maid to suck his big boner. 
[00:06:00]  Of course.  And she doesn't.  She lost her mind.  She didn't want to suck his big boner.  So she runs out of the room, down the hallway, like, freaking out.  Right.  And he's like, uh-oh.  Ah, shit.  So he grabs his shit, leaving stuff behind, like, left a cell phone behind and some clothes  and everything, and, like, ran out of there, ran right to the airport, jumps on an Air France  plane, and 10 minutes before it went to take off, I guess, you know, the feds knocked on 
[00:06:30]  the plane door and said, ah, we got to get this guy.  Wait, how he got caught?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, 10 minutes before the flight?  Oh, yeah.  He was on the plane ready to go.  Oh, ready to go.  And the United States has no extradition treaty with France.  Yeah.  So, like, um, like, uh, what's his name, uh, the director?  Yeah, Roman Polanski.  Polanski.  Yeah.  He would have been, you know, pretty much home free.  Scott's free.  Yeah. </pre>
