<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton engaging in crude sexual banter before shifting to their experience filming Kevin Pollak's documentary, "Misery Loves Comedy," in a bizarre, cluttered apartment.  They recounted their interactions with Pollak and his attractive producer girlfriend, and hilariously described witnessing Dave Voss bomb a stand-up set.  The conversation touched upon the upcoming film's release and its star-studded cast, including Jimmy Fallon.

The show then extensively covered the devastating boardwalk fire in Seaside Park and Seaside Heights, New Jersey, playing news reports and speculating on the cause, suggesting arson as a possibility.  This transitioned into a heated debate surrounding the Washington Redskins' name, with the hosts and callers expressing diverse and often strongly worded opinions, using racial slurs, and  discussing the broader issue of political correctness.  The discussion also encompassed other potentially offensive team names like the Cleveland Indians, Chicago Blackhawks, and Kansas City Chiefs, exploring the complexities of name changes based on complaints.

The next segment delved into discussions of political correctness, particularly regarding the use of the word "retard," and immediately pivoted to the boardwalk fire, again leading to insensitive jokes about arson. The hosts then launched into another heated discussion about the Washington Redskins' name, using offensive racial slurs and attacking political correctness.  The conversation then moved to the New York Islanders' relocation to Brooklyn, with derogatory comments about their old arena.  They provided an incorrect explanation of ice installation in hockey arenas, before a caller offered a corrected account.  The show then played a Fozzy song ("Spider in My Mouth"), speculated on Chris Jericho's wrestling career, and criticized Sylvester Stallone's exorbitant autograph fees at Comic Con.  This segued into a critique of Robert De Niro's recent films and a detailed review of his career.  A trailer for "Grudge Match" was reviewed, along with further discussion of political correctness and a playing of E-Rock's Lady Gaga cover, "Der Saw."  Chris Jericho briefly appeared outside the studio to promote a Fozzy concert, and a forthcoming appearance by a Rockstar Games representative for GTA V was also announced.

Chris Jericho joined the show as a guest, discussing his career as a wrestler and the lead singer of Fozzy, detailing the band's history, current success, and touring experiences, including a long drive to Patchogue. He discussed working with Fandango in WWE, his unexpected Wrestlemania role, and Fandango's surprising rise to popularity. Jericho shared anecdotes about attending a Black Sabbath concert with his son, appearing in Pollak's documentary, and meeting Pavarotti.  He also talked about his past radio show, the upcoming Metallica show at the Apollo Theater, and his experiences with other musicians, including Bruce Dickinson and Ozzy Osbourne. Laszlo, a technical contributor, was also present, assisting with the technical aspects and participating in conversations.  The segment concluded with promotion of Jericho’s upcoming show and online presence.


A Rockstar Games developer, Laszlo, then appeared to discuss GTA V, showcasing gameplay footage, highlighting the expansive map, three playable characters, in-game features like radio stations (with DJs like Kenny Loggins and over 240 licensed songs), and the wide range of activities.  Laszlo described the characters, showcased the game's diverse environments, and revealed details about the game's chatty hookers. Anthony Cumia's contribution as the voice of "Pisswasser" beer was discussed, and a song with offensive lyrics was played. Jim Norton's hilariously inept gameplay demonstration provided comedic relief.  The segment also briefly touched upon Opie and Anthony’s recent radio tour experiences, including a visit to a vegan strip club.  A Metallica ticket giveaway was announced for the after-show.

The final segment was a chaotic mix of announcements, guest appearances, and rambling conversations. Opie and Anthony promoted their appearances, while Laszlo plugged his radio show and upcoming tour, mentioning a BBC appearance.  He teased a secret casting detail for his game. Sam Roberts was introduced as the next host.  Numerous calls regarding Metallica tickets interrupted the show, leading to the arrival of Kendra Wilkinson, who promoted her reality show, "Kendra on Top," engaging in explicit discussions of open relationships, nudity, and parenting. DJ Who Kid also joined, contributing to the chaotic and sexually charged banter. A Metallica song-guessing contest was held, with Roland participating.  Discussions regarding GTA V merchandise occurred, along with further off-color comments and jokes.  The segment closed with more promotional announcements and comments about Kendra Wilkinson's physical attributes.

Let's get this show on the road.  God damn is that a good song.  I love ushering in Friday with that one.  Absolutely.  I can't believe we have Larry King.  I'm going to say this every fucking Friday.  Because it's amazing to me.  Larry King 50 set. 
[00:02:30]  And Mike Tyson.  And yeah.  Now you got Mike Tyson up in this bitch.  Doing our Friday song.  Fucking great.  Friday.  Oh my God.  I just saw you guys.  I know right.  We was just somewhere east side yo.  East side.  We were in a creepy apartment last night.  The place was weird.  The place was very strange.  When the shoombs walked in afterwards. 
[00:03:00]  She was like.  Is this like a set?  Like no.  This is a real fucking apartment.  Oh she thought possibly maybe they set it up that way.  Is this a set?  I guess Kevin Pollack's doing a documentary on the art of comedy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Misery Loves Comedy.  Misery Loves Comedy is the title.  The working title.  How creepy that picture is.  I tweeted a couple pictures from the set.  And they're using a friend of Kevin Pollack's mom's apartment. 
[00:03:30]  And it looks like the apartment is from the turn of the century.  Just picture what you would assume.  A small apartment for a little old lady.  Yeah.  With like one little dog.  Right.  But she bought all that stuff when it was brand new.  Right.  And never replaced it.  Yes.  There were strange things all over the apartment.  It was cool though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very dark wood and old drapes. 
[00:04:00]  Things like that.  Old lamps.  Very heavy drapes that you know would go up real nice if a fire started.  Right.  You know.  And then knickknacks all over the place.  Oh.  Lots of knickknacks.  It's really just strange things.  I didn't want to like violate her privacy.  But I wanted to take a whole bunch of pictures.  Yeah.  You should have.  You could have.  No.  I don't think that would have been right.  I don't know. 
[00:04:30]  That's a great shot.  Yeah.  There's one of all of us that was.  I didn't.  Yes.  No.  No.  I think that Kevin's guy got it.  I don't have that.  I would love to see that because that's a really cool framing.  I'm sure.  Because Jimmy left early.  Well.  Not left early.  He did his part and he had other things to do.  That was set.  Yeah.  And then me and Anne had a finish up.  So at the end of the whole thing we got a shot.  Me.  Anthony.  Kevin Pollack.  And his girl.  Kevin Pollack's girl who we met for the first time yesterday.  And I don't.  She's one of the producers.  Yeah.  I know.  I forgot her name.  She's hot too.  Yeah.  Very hot. 
[00:05:00]  Very nice.  She had a rock on her left finger that was really depressed when I saw a big ring.  Big old rock.  Yeah.  I was like I need a producer in my life.  Oh no.  It was fun though man.  Yeah.  Kevin's chick is funny.  We were talking about like she is a fanatic with old movie quotes, old shows.  She listens to the show all the time.  Right.  And yeah so we were just going back and forth with like Fast Times Ridgemont High quotes  and Twilight Zone.  She could just pull them out like.  That's fucking great.  The perfect girl for Kevin Pollack.  Right. 
[00:05:30]  And they're like uber fans of the radio show which is kind of strange.  Very cool.  Kevin's great man.  He's fucking funny.  He's a nice guy.  Solid dude.  Yeah.  And he got us involved with this movie that's going to have a lot of big fucking names in  it.  Holy shit.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This thing's going to be pretty big.  Jimmy Fallon, are we allowed to mention the people that are in it?  I think so.  Pretty much every comic you could imagine is going to be in this movie and we got the  old invite.  That's nice.  Very cool man.  There's a guy taking care of his friends, huh? 
[00:06:00]  I like that.  We like when we're taken care of.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's nice to be included.  It really is.  What the fuck?  It's nice to be included.  Wake up you assholes.  You know how many tickets we've sold for you over the years?  Put us in something.  Yeah.  It was very nice of him.  No it was cool.  It was very, very cool.  I was sitting there when Jimmy was doing his solo shoot.  Right.  When you started talking about like Voss bombing and stuff and how you were watching and him  with his stupid ponytail.  Dude, it was so hard not to laugh. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I had to be quiet.  It's the hardest thing to not fucking laugh when something's hilarious.  Oh.  We talked about the joy of bombing or something.  Yes.  And I've told Rich this.  It was one of my greatest moments was watching my pal Voss fucking tank for 45.  It was just...  And the way you described it though, it was the utter uselessness of her.  It hit me even trying to get out of it.  Like there was nothing he could do to get out of this bombing.  Because we all developed like little skills at making a bad set good and everything he 
[00:07:00]  had learned in all the years he had been doing it.  Pulled out all the stops.  Dude, nothing he did in that night would work.  There are times when that happens and those are scary.  Like those are really scary and it was fun watching him go through that.  You must just think you're done.  Like you lost it.  There's no way...  Like how can I not at least get part of the crowd back?  There are times where you walk off where you have a bad set.  You're like, fuck that and they stunk.  And then there's times when you're walking up the steps of the cell and you're going,  I'm just not good at this. 
[00:07:30]  Like I have to get out.  I lost it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Chris Rock said something once about comedy.  He goes, you never want to lose your fastball.  And I think of that sometimes like, oh, fuck.  That was a good comparison, man.  I'm like, yeah.  Every time I have a bad set, I'm like, I lose my fucking fastball.  You start thinking that way, yeah.  Watching Voss struggle.  Great, yeah.  You take great joy in that.  But can you picture something funny other than watching your friend bomb in front of everybody?  Because you know he's funny.  It's not like he's not a funny guy.  But watching a funny guy bomb is even better. 
[00:08:00]  Right, right, yeah.  Because you just know what he's going through.  Well, you guys are all twisted, too.  Fucking great.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  But another project where we did the Chris Rock thing recently, which was awesome.  But they filmed for an hour, and we know we might be in it for, if we're lucky, 10 seconds.  And this, there's so many people involved.  You do the math.  I was doing the math on the way home.  I'm like, wow, we just filmed for, they rolled film for at least an hour total on all of us. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, at least.  But there's like 45 guys.  So I'm like, 45 guys, a 90-minute movie.  Well, yeah.  Maybe two minutes a guy, maybe, if you're lucky.  But the way he's doing it, you'd be strung through the whole thing.  Like, everybody.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not going to be, now, here's this guy, and here's this guy.  The way he described it was really cool.  Like, he's got just topics that are similar with each person.  Yeah.  And that'll string it through. 
[00:09:00]  So they'll do like, okay, here's your thoughts on what makes, what emotions make people funny.  Right.  Let's just say.  And then there's everyone talking about that.  Yeah, of course.  And then here's that.  So you're back again talking about another topic and stuff.  Well, the Oapster was hoping for, you know, 10 straight minutes.  10 straight minutes.  Just one long.  Just Oapster dialogue.  A little Oapster monologue.  God.  People would walk out of the theater.  Oh, my.  Imagine just one shot, not even different shots, just one, one fucking. 
[00:09:30]  And then when I was 12, I, you know, Kevin, the laughter would wash over me.  It's just pontificating.  And then you wrap it up with like, and it truly is the best medicine.  And just people fucking flabbergasted.  No, it's going to move.  It's going to be like that, that, that, that.  But hopefully, you know, hopefully we'll be in it a bunch.  That'll be really, really cool. 
[00:10:00]  And then I started seeing, last night I watched the TV, and they were playing commercials for  an officer in a movie.  Right.  It's like one of these, I guess, the military channel plays movies, whatever the fuck it  is.  And it was a few good men.  They were advertising.  And they're like, Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, and an all-star cast.  And then they just go through everyone.  It's like, that is Kevin Pollack.  Come on.  We're just with that guy.  He's in a fucking, a huge movie.  A new one?  No, no. 
[00:10:30]  It was a few good men.  Oh, right, right.  I'm like, holy shit, man.  There he is.  Nice.  Sitting there, putting a smirk on his face.  He throws out like, like he's amazing.  He throws lines out.  Like he just kind of, it's a throwaway type of technique he has or something.  Yeah.  He's really fucking, that's hard to do, man.  Just to make it look like it's such a natural.  He's a very convincing actor is what he is.  He's like, I think he's very underestimated as an actor, even though he's been in like  some really good movies.  Fucking Usual Suspects.  He's amazing.  He was great in that.  And he, you're never watching it going like, oh, look, the comedian's trying to act. 
[00:11:00]  Like he fucking plays it and does a great job.  Thank you.  Always has.  Oh, Jimmy Norton, I meant.  Always has.  So, uh, did, did you go in the kitchen for the food?  The little tiny kitchen?  I didn't eat, no.  It scared me.  Christ.  It scared me.  Yeah.  Anytime an old, anytime, and that was a beautiful apartment, but any type of an older apartment  that has so many knickknacks and things for bugs to hide in.  And again, I didn't see any bugs in this place, but I remember being at someone's house years 
[00:11:30]  ago and it was like one of those older places, but bigger and library books and all this  beautiful.  And then I heard it was infested with roaches.  And again, just those older places.  I like a nice modern clockwork orange room.  There's fucking, what's that?  Chair over there!  And then nothing else.  No bugs.  Dark, yeah.  There's no way.  Like, nowhere they can hide.  Yeah.  Mr. Pratt's apartment from Creepshow.  Right.  Right.  Bugs, they creep up on you.  Did you see anything there?  No.  Would you have food?  I mean, did you have any food?  Oh, I did.  Well, they brought it in. 
[00:12:00]  It wasn't cooked in the place.  Oh, it was in like, I didn't have it.  It was in like, uh, the smallest trays.  The smallest kitchen ever, first of all.  It's like a phone booth.  A New York City kitchen, it's unbelievable.  How small was that?  It was, it was maybe five feet by five feet.  It's a walk-in closet.  Yeah.  It might have been five feet by five feet.  And it had, you know, it had to have everything in it.  The sink.  Got a little fridge, stove, a sink.  It was unbelievable how small that kitchen was.  And, you know, I'm trying to eat much better these days. 
[00:12:30]  And I did great all day yesterday again.  Did the opster have a moment?  Those raviolis were pretty goddamn good.  There you go.  Raviolis.  I was hungry.  Oh, they were raviolis.  It was great.  I rolled into the kitchen after eating, I would have to say I ate perfect yesterday again.  Oh, dude.  But I was a little hungry.  And, of course, I had to have six of them.  I had six.  They were the big ones.  And then I had to pour the fucking red sauce on top of it for more goodness.  Oh, it was delicious, though. 
[00:13:00]  God damn it.  It was ravioli there last night?  Yes.  You're so lucky you got out of there alive.  And then Amy comes in and she says...  How do you say no to ravioli?  Amy did.  She had a big plate of salad.  She's eating salad like a little bunny rabbit.  You can't say no to ravioli.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Cheese ravioli.  Are you kidding me?  With a good red sauce?  I would have a cup.  I can't eat...  Ravioli doesn't kill me.  I don't love it that much.  Ziti's harder for me.  Well, I had that, too.  I had that, too.  And it was spicy.  Like, ooh, the sauce was spicy.  I want to know.  I was able to say no to the ziti.  Of course, to have the cheesy pasta. 
[00:13:30]  I was like, fwok.  Fwok.  Were you disgusted with yourself when you left?  Yes, of course.  You have to eat that, dude.  You got to eat dinner.  You got to eat dinner.  They didn't have anything healthy there.  You have to have a little more than a salad.  You need something with substance.  Bring some carrots.  I bring carrots in my pockets.  Pockets full of carrots.  People trying to be interviewed, and you just go...  Crunching carrots.  Cut!  That was fun, though. 
[00:14:00]  That was really fun.  How long after I left did they have the food come out?  I don't know.  I think it was there the whole time.  No, no.  I remember they came in and brought it out.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Because I was in there.  They had little pretzels and a few of those little circle chocolate candies.  Yeah, I didn't...  No, they came in with, like, CD and...  Mmm.  But...  All kinds of goodness.  Yeah, I fucking...  That was a long day, though, man.  We were there, like, four hours.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Fuck.  It went fast, though.  Not complaining, trust me, but...  It went fast.  You guys had that for four hours?  Oh, you had that for a while?  Fuck. 
[00:14:30]  I think we finally got out of there, what, 9?  8.30, 9.  Yeah, it was about 5.30 until 9.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  How long did you guys talk on your, your, your, uh...  10, 15.  Yeah, it was fun.  Individual about 15, yeah.  And then all three of us on the couch together, that was, like, what, 40 minutes?  I literally feel like I'm sitting in between my parents and talking about you guys.  That was funny.  Yeah, it was Opie, and then Jimmy, and then me, sitting on this couch, just yapping about  stuff, and, uh...  Yeah, Jimmy in the middle.  It was fun.  Like our son. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Your little, your little weird seed that's grown up.  Our little tard.  It's just getting weird lately.  We've been at this a long fucking time, man.  I was just thinking about that yesterday after we left.  We've been doing this a long time together.  Me and Ed, 19 years.  Jimmy's 11, 10, how long?  I don't even know now.  Almost 13 from 2000.  13, yeah.  This is part of 2000.  Or 2001.  It's unbelievable, man.  Fuck.  Yeah.  So strange. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, it's going to be 2014 real quick.  Huh?  It's going to be 2014 really fucking quick.  It's only, it's, you know...  That's our 20th anniversary.  We probably should do some cool shit.  Oh, you started in 94.  When did it?  94.  Was it early?  Summer of 94.  Okay.  94.  Holy fuck.  The OJ thing.  OJ.  OJ will be 20 years.  Yep, 20 years.  That happened in 94.  Do you realize he could have gone to prison for fucking murder?  Yeah, and he'd be out already.  And gotten out.  Oh, my God.  Gotten out on a fucking, you know, on a, what, murder fucking two? 
[00:16:00]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe even, like, whittle it down to a...  Maybe.  One of those, hey, I went crazy kind of a thing, you know?  It was part of the moment.  Yeah, he probably would have had a shot of getting out by now.  But now he's back in jail.  Now he's in jail.  He popped up, what, last month, and now what?  Yeah.  What happened with all that?  That went away quickly.  Two years, I think.  Yeah.  Two more years.  He's got to serve two more years.  Right.  Oh, they said no to his, uh...  Yeah, they said you got... 
[00:16:30]  Was he eligible or no?  Was it parole he was up for or no?  They were having a hearing.  Yeah, they had a hearing.  Okay.  And they said no, okay.  Because I don't know how that ended.  It popped up and then it just sort of went away on its own.  It ended, hey, you killed two people.  You're not getting out of this.  Big story, uh, fucking Seaside got hit again.  Boy, God hates you, Jersey.  God hates New Jersey.  I don't know.  I, I, uh, God.  Right after we were talking about fire on the beach. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  A lot of people are hurting today, but I, I, I think someone set that fucking fire.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  I think there's a business that, you know, maybe a little, uh, what they used to call the old, uh, Jewish lightning.  Oh, yeah.  So somebody's like, you know what?  Let's just get rid of this thing.  Well, look, they, you know, the hurricane came through and fucked up the businesses and they're trying to make the big comeback.  And someone out there probably had a really, really bad seat.  Well, most of them had a really, really bad season, but there's probably one, one business that was like, look, we can't, we can't do this anymore. 
[00:17:30]  Can't afford this.  Yeah.  Burn it down.  It seems way too suspicious.  Doesn't it?  All of a sudden it got a little windy and it's like, oh, it's taken everybody's business.  Yeah, I, I, I would have, I bet the one business was probably thinking, all right, I'll just, you know, mine will be taken out.  Maybe a little, a little collateral damage, but nothing too bad.  Wipes out 80% of the fucking, uh, boardwalk.  And then the winds come sweeping in and they, it took out 82 businesses. 
[00:18:00]  It pretty much took out everybody.  Crazy.  I don't think there's anyone standing.  It was huge.  Yeah.  Huge fire.  You gotta think it's suspicious.  No.  Fuck yeah, man.  Is that bad to say?  What?  No.  If you think it's suspicious, it's, I think it's suspicious.  Don't believe it.  They, these, they, the geniuses and they'll figure it out.  They'll know exactly where.  Yeah.  Well, it was two matches as opposed to originally we thought three.  How the fuck do you know that?  When they backtracing fire?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  It really is amazing.  That's an amazing science.  Here's my, my, my analysis. 
[00:18:30]  It was hot.  Thank you.  Thanks, burnt.  But that's just horrible.  And then the boardwalk they just kind of rebuilt.  They had to rip apart to fight the fire.  Yeah.  That's, uh, that's something.  No, it's the end of the summer though, right?  Huh?  It's the end of the summer or so.  These businesses, not that it's good, but it'll be closing soon anyway.  Yeah, they'll build it back up again.  It's, uh, yeah, there was no fun in Funtown yesterday.  Man, that is really fucking being windswept.  Yep.  Holy shit.  Devastating fire hits Jersey Shore. 
[00:19:00]  Dozens of businesses.  Well, this is an earlier report because now they're saying 82 businesses.  Oh, is this live right now?  Unbelievable.  You said the good news that it's Friday.  The good news is really that we've had a downpour this morning to help the firefighters out.  Not sure how much you can see, but you can see the hook and ladder trucks behind me.  Many, many, many of them.  More than 400 firefighters out here trying to battle this thing that started yesterday afternoon  and destroyed about 30 businesses.  A state of emergency on the Jersey Shore. 
[00:19:30]  Holy fuck.  Hundreds of firefighters battling a massive inferno that raged into the night.  Wow.  The fire finally under control.  The fast-moving blaze destroying dozens of businesses.  That's amazing.  In a six-block stretch.  A lot of fire.  In just hours along the boardwalk between Seaside Park and Seaside Heights.  Six blocks.  Two communities hit hard by Superstorm Sandy nearly one year ago.  I said to my staff, I feel like I want to throw up.  This amateur video shows the fire erupting at the ice cream stand just after 2 p.m. on Thursday. 
[00:20:00]  Don't go in there!  Within hours, the fire and gold block after block spread by high winds gusting over 30 miles per hour.  My manager came in the stand and told me to get out because there was smoke coming up through the boardwalk.  We ran away and turned around again and there were just flames coming out of the building.  The inferno so big, first responders had to pump water from this nearby bay.  The fire eventually contained by a 20-foot-wide trench built by firefighters. 
[00:20:30]  Within 15 minutes, there were more flames than I ever seen in my life.  I got scared.  Gay people.  It was amazing.  It's terrible what's going on.  It really is.  It's horrifying what's going on here.  The whole town, the people that grew up here, the people that work here are suffering a lot of damage.  After everything that we just went through for rebuilding everything, especially the shore,  and to know that it's all burning down now.  I'm sorry.  The thick black smoke could be seen for miles.  Governor Chris Christie urging the public to stay out of the area. 
[00:21:00]  My advice to you, in fact, my admonition to you is do not come here.  Do not travel.  Stay away.  This area near the Funtown Pier, one of the few stretches of boardwalk that survived Sandy,  now has fallen victim to this incredible fire.  Oh, there goes Funtown.  The neighboring pier's roller coaster washed into the ocean became a symbolic image of Jersey String.  Repairs to the boardwalk after Sandy completed in time for its summer season, reopening this May. 
[00:21:30]  The state's resolved, being tested once again.  Wait.  And listen, this is us, so we'll, you know, as soon as this is over, we'll pick ourselves up,  we'll dust ourselves off, and we'll get back to work.  Now, was this, was the new boardwalk destroyed, or was this an old area?  Parts of it.  Yeah.  Parts of it.  I'm not sure how much of it, but yeah, the firefighters had to kind of rip it up.  Weren't there a lot of old buildings that were, all those businesses were old businesses, weren't there?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, it was the boardwalk that wasn't, okay.  Yeah, they redid the boardwalk, and then supposedly they had to, you know, take a lot of the boardwalk out. 
[00:22:00]  Whoopsie.  Oh, the NFL commissioner.  Ugh, this Redskins thing.  They really want to force them to change their name, huh?  I don't think they should.  I want them to change their name, but I don't want them to be forced to.  I want them to do it because they think it's, very rarely do I agree with political correctness.  Well, remember the whole thing about the minority gets the big voice.  The commissioner said something like, if one person speaks up, we have to listen to them.  Which is not true.  He's an idiot.  He's a dope.  You got to listen to the majority, but we don't when it comes to those political correctness. 
[00:22:30]  It's unbelievable.  They know where the fire started.  Okay.  This guy might have more info than we do.  Somehow I doubt it.  Yes.  He's in South Carolina, too.  That makes it a little...  Yes.  Kevin, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, I'm from Jersey.  I just live here.  Hey, I was watching the news this morning, and they said it started in one of those Custard  Spans.  It's Coors.  K-O-H-R-S.  I think it's pronounced Coors.  Yeah, we saw that on the news.  Right, right.  Yeah, so they already, you know, probably didn't take much figuring. 
[00:23:00]  They probably just said, holy shit, the Custard Spans on fire, you know.  But yeah, they figured out where it started already.  Wow.  So I got...  You wonder, was it...  I guess it was...  Oh, it was during the day, so it probably wasn't set.  Because the don't go in there, there was people milling about it.  It wasn't like it was a middle of the night thing.  Yeah.  2.30.  2.30.  2.30.  2.30.  2.30.  2.30.  In the afternoon, yeah.  What do you think was it electrical?  I don't know.  Could have been, yeah.  Bye.  What else could start a fire like that in a fucking...  Ice cream.  A flammable ice cream.  Yeah.  It's pretty...  Oh, I'm actually a fan of flammable ice cream. 
[00:23:30]  It's delicious.  Yes.  You have to eat it before it melts.  It's really tough to set ice cream on fire.  Yes.  Ice cream is a little more suspicious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And frozen custard.  Frozen custard.  I don't know.  Something seems a little suspicious.  Mm-hmm.  And this just shows you what food issues are like, because now I'm not thinking of the  fire.  I'm thinking of how delicious some frozen custard would be.  God, yeah.  Fucking asshole I am.  That is good stuff.  That's just horrible, though.  Yeah.  What's the coincidence, though? 
[00:24:00]  Poor Jersey.  Same place that gets destroyed by a hurricane gets destroyed by a fire.  Mm-hmm.  That's a little strange.  But...  And no one got hurt, right?  Like, no one...  No.  Some firefighters, but...  Yeah, there's no one really down there, especially during the week.  After the season, you know, maybe you hit up those places on the weekend.  Yeah.  But there's only, what, 28...  They said there's 2,800 or 20,000 people that live there, and then it balloons up in the 
[00:24:30]  summertime.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, all those houses there.  Yeah.  You're talking about the Redskins?  It's annoying me.  Ultimately, I don't think it's Roger Goodall's decision.  Right.  He said that, you know, it's the Redskins' owner's decision.  He says he'll never change the name, and he has no intention to sell the team.  Right.  So, he basically said, like, yeah, you know, we'll listen if somebody complains, but, in  the end, the name's been approved by the NFL, and the owner is the only person who can 
[00:25:00]  change that name, and he is, right now at least, is adamantly saying, I will never change  the name.  I absolutely love that guy, because political correctness is getting ridiculous.  You know?  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  But, you know, like, there's so many websites now.  Yeah, but how many people are actually, but how many are actual football fans?  Who?  That are starting that shit.  Oh, I know, like, one, like, reporter for Sports Illustrated, like, his website, they 
[00:25:30]  just refer to them as the Washington football team.  Oh, do they?  I don't like that.  Do they really?  Stop.  Yeah.  There's a radio host on this platform that doesn't call them by the Redskins.  Greg, who's that?  Greg O.P. Hughes?  Fez.  Fez doesn't?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, fuck!  You're kidding.  Why?  He's not an Indian.  I don't know.  He finds it offensive.  He doesn't like social injustice.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  They, they, what I told you, I was, I thought it was ridiculous.  I want to fucking puke.  I saw them, I saw them, I saw them explain themselves.  And when I saw Indians explain, American Indians explain themselves, it didn't feel PC to me.  What they were saying was like, look, this is why we find this really, I was like, ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Listen, listen, why.  Fuck, man.  But, but, but, it was like, in fairness, if, they wouldn't dare.  Like, let the owner of the Redskins, who's so ballsy with this, how about you do something with fucking blacks? 
[00:26:30]  The Sambos.  Or, or, or, or even like a piece of, um, about a fucking jersey that shows a black player and cartoon his lips a little bit.  Right.  Or show a fucking, do it, like, if you want to be, if this guy is so balls to the wall, then, of course not, he wouldn't dare.  Well, what about, though, you call him, okay, because that's not an offensive thing.  How many times have you heard someone, the Zulus, being called a Redskin?  You ha, you haven't.  I mean, I haven't, but American Indians, of all the people, they've gotten fucked. 
[00:27:00]  The reason why they, they, uh, called the team the Redskins, uh, what's the, what's the, the reason?  It wasn't, it wasn't based on anything racist or anything like that.  But it's the whole thing of their, it's a proud warrior thing.  It's, it's not looked at as demeaning.  I mean, it's, it's like, yeah, look at him.  He's a fucking proud Indian warrior.  So, if you had a black guy, but it was, um, like, a caricature of, of stereotypical black guy face or something, that would be bad. 
[00:27:30]  But if you had a team called the Zulus, where it's some, you know, uh, proud black warrior, how would that be offensive?  It, it, there's something about, the way they described it, and again, this was something I hadn't considered until they said it, was that there's something about cartooning warriors and all, are, they, and they, like, if you showed the Zulus, the outrage or the fucking backlash for that would be absolute and immediate.  I know it would be, but they're not, they're not cartooning, the, the, the logo's not a cartoon.  The logo is, is like Anthony said, it's a, it's a photo of, of, of a proud warrior. 
[00:28:00]  It's not like the fucking brains is worse than that.  If anybody really, yeah, if anybody really wants to be outraged, shouldn't you be outraged at, like, the Indians logo?  Nakahoma.  Or like, or Chief Nakahoma?  Like, nobody talks about that.  That's why I kind of side with the American Indians, because they're the only fucking group, they're the only group that has to deal with this shit.  Yeah, but they're not, they're not making a big stink about the Indians or the Braves.  They're, it's, it's, it's, yeah, they don't like, oh yeah, they have.  Yeah, but you don't hear about it.  When, when do you hear about that in the news?  When you hear, this is more the, when you hear Bud Seelig saying, uh, you know, well, we have to listen to some people that, that, that are offended by the Indian thing. 
[00:28:30]  Well, I think that for them, I think Redskins is the worst.  That's my, I believe that that was, what I remember them saying is something to do with, that was how they were referred to, Indian bodies.  That's fine. Like, look, I'm sure I don't understand, you know, from their point of view.  Right. Like, I'm, you know, I'm not trying to pretend I do.  I just feel you can't, like, uh, fold to political correctness ever at this point, because it's getting so ridiculous and out of hand.  See, I agree with you on, on that principle, like, but just because it's PC, like, I don't want to be against it just because it's PC.  Right.  Like, I tend to push back against any language that fucking changes, and once in a while they'll come up with one and you go, all right, that actually makes sense. 
[00:29:00]  Well, the problem is you're logical, but we live in a world where no one's logical anymore, and it's like we've got to get rid of everything, everything around us.  Like, it was told to me at the school the other night, I forgot to tell you, that, you know, the kids will sit crisscross applesauce.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, not Indian style.  They've started with that.  I mean, that shit's been in the schools for a while.  I'm like, what?  You can't, you can't say, you can't say sit Indian style?  That doesn't even make sense, applesauce. 
[00:29:30]  Did Indian sit that way or not?  Boss had the greatest joke about that Indian style.  He goes, should I get a bottle of whiskey and lay on the curb?  Fucking mean, boss.  That is mean.  But my point is, why is that offensive?  Did Indian sit like that or not?  So when your child sits that way, why is it bad to say, we're going to now sit Indian style?  Indian style.  I never second-guessed that as a kid.  I never even thought twice about it.  But that's what I mean about the political correctness, and we have to get rid of all of it, 
[00:30:00]  because it might be somehow, possibly offensive to somebody somewhere.  And Indian read the crayon.  They changed the name in Crayola, and it didn't even mean American Indian.  It was like India read.  It was read from the clay of India, so it was Indian.  It wasn't read, but they changed the name anyway of that crayon.  Why was that offensive?  Just explain to me why this stuff is offensive.  I think because they feel that they were kind of slaughtered and conquered.  Well, they made some bad decisions.  We all know that. 
[00:30:30]  Granted, Manhattan was not a good deal.  But they were kind of treated shitty for a long time,  and then all of this stuff that kind of caricatured or cartooned them.  And now this is like one of those things where I don't think it's being crazy PC  to listen to them on certain things.  I think if there's every, and the word, you know,  there are times where political correctness is just like a fucking despicable, like, ugh.  But then there are times where it's like, eh.  I don't think you should shove it down people's throats.  This Redskins thing when there's so many other issues  that could be putting energy behind that really means something. 
[00:31:00]  This doesn't mean anything.  And the people that want it to be called Redskins aren't all of a sudden going to be like,  okay, I agree.  They're going to be like, ugh, you made this fucking change.  Where does the term Redskins come from?  Can we look at that up?  Because I've heard their explanation.  I've heard that, too.  I've heard that it's like piles of Redskins.  They were just called Redskins because their skin was a redder tone  from being out in the sun than the white man that came in the ship.  But they also used the clay.  Yeah, a lot of red clay and shit like that.  So I don't think it had anything to do with their bodies. 
[00:31:30]  What?  The origins are disputed.  Yeah.  Yes.  It is disputed.  But up until recently, when they wanted to make a case for Redskins,  I never heard that Redskins of the bloodied Redskins before they wanted to pull the name.  I had them.  I always assumed they were called Redskins just because they did have that redder tone.  And I remember the guy saying, and so when they would kill however many Indians there were, 
[00:32:00]  that was how they referred to it.  There would be like a bunch of slaves being shot or stabbed to say,  you've got five Blackskins in this thing.  And they just find it.  I just heard it's like, oh, look out.  There's a bunch of Redskins over that hill.  Yeah, maybe.  You know, like, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.  Like in the Westerns, they call them that.  You know, like, ah, look out.  There's a big ton of Redskins up around.  It wasn't when they were dead, you know, here's what's left.  Redskins.  I never heard of that.  Ridiculous.  Never heard of that.  I don't think it's true.  I think it's propaganda.  Right.  What's going on with the Blackhawks?  Because a lot of people are calling about the Blackhawks, too. 
[00:32:30]  They're saying some of that shit's going on in Chicago.  I'm sure it is.  Because they have an Indian as their logo.  So you just can't have Indians as logos.  Blackhawk Indians.  Right.  All right.  So, but that was, they were real.  Yeah, I highly doubt that the NHL created that team because they said,  let's be offensive to Indians.  Of course.  We all know that.  With a black face or a Jewish face.  Even one of honor.  Even like Ant said, like, not a cartoon or a caricature.  Right.  But how about a fucking, a black guy, just a black face and a team called the Blackskins. 
[00:33:00]  But that doesn't make sense.  Like, like, Indians have this warrior spirit.  That's where it all came from.  It comes from a place of, of looking at them and, and saying, wow.  Yeah.  Like, like, they were, they were strong.  We want a team logo that's strong and proud.  Right.  And so that's why.  You wouldn't do it just like, okay, the, the, you know, the fucking Brooklyn Jews.  No, no, no, no.  It's like, what, what, they're, they're, they're horrible at their sport, but boy, can they count.  And didn't we all grow up thinking Indians were really fucking cool when you started learning 
[00:33:30]  about them?  Yes.  You were like, oh, fuck, man.  Yeah.  You didn't think, like, what a, what a bunch of pussies.  Right.  However.  But the Zulus, like you said, that is a good example.  They're warriors.  And say, out of respect, there was Zulu warriors, just shirtless with a bone in their nose, which  is how they would have dressed.  Right.  True to the native thing.  Not caricaturing, not mocking them, the black, black skins, because that's what they are.  I think if a team was formed in the thirties, let's say, and they were called the Zulus, 
[00:34:00]  I think up until recently, relatively speaking, you wouldn't have heard anything.  And then if you did, it would be the type of Reverend Al, horse shit, saying, oh, you've  got to get rid of this racist name and stuff.  It's like, why?  You're kind of paying tribute to a powerful...  The Blackhawks were founded in 1926, and they were named the Blackhawks because they, that  was a prominent figure in the history of Illinois, the Blackhawks. 
[00:34:30]  And they were named that in honor of the military unit, making it one of many sports teams using  Native Americans as icons.  Yeah, it was just a thing to do.  Sure.  It was one of those things to do.  What about the, you know, the Notre Dame fighting Irish?  That's the only one I can think of that's not...  You know, I was brought up to Fez yesterday.  Little fucking, little midget-looking fucking leprechaun-y Irish guy who's fighting.  Maybe it doesn't bother them, though.  Like, they haven't complained about it.  Like, if they don't like it, they can complain about it. 
[00:35:00]  But I could...  That should...  That would be bothersome, right?  That Irish people are known to just be fighters.  Oh, look.  That's terrible fighting Irish.  Right.  But I'm not bothered by that.  Well, yeah, but I mean...  But we shouldn't be bothered by any of this.  But what if one Irish person is?  But that's...  Again, that's why I said I don't agree with what one person complains that you have to  listen.  I don't agree with that.  I don't subscribe to that at all.  I'm not bothered by any of them across the board.  Period.  It's so ridiculous.  It's exhausting.  The only one I do...  No one had a problem with the Redskins for decades. 
[00:35:30]  No one even thought twice about it.  Now all of a sudden.  But in this new world we live in, everyone's running around trying to figure out what can  we change next.  Yeah, it's a power space.  That's what's going on here, and that's why I have a problem with this.  Growing up, we never heard one person having a problem with the Redskins name.  Not one.  But now it's like, okay, what can we change next?  That's what's going on out there.  I agree in a lot of cases that's correct.  I think that's the way it is.  Only with these...  For some reason, these issues, I just... 
[00:36:00]  When they said it, I heard them.  They just made...  Hearing them explain themselves made a lot of sense to me.  It wasn't...  It didn't sound knee-jerk reaction.  It didn't sound like that to me.  It didn't feel like they were going...  And then we want...  Like, it didn't sound like they were being PC babies.  And believe me, I was prepared to think, fuck these guys.  Well, we got a guy, Tom.  He makes a pretty good point here.  Go ahead, Tom.  North Carolina, go.  Hey, good morning, guys.  I was up on the Cherokee reservation last week in North Carolina doing a little fly 
[00:36:30]  fishing, a little gambling.  Those fuckers are all dressed up in their warrior outfits, trying to scam every single  person that walks by to come watch them do their war dances, and hit you up for a tip.  Hey, we don't get paid here.  We don't solicit, but we'll pass the hat around if you put money in.  Oh, yeah.  They'll have no problem dressing up like warriors to make a few bucks.  That's them doing it, so...  And then they're making horses off at casinos.  And then, if you fish on their reservation, for some reason, your license doesn't cover  it, so you have to pay them an additional $10. 
[00:37:00]  Those fuckers are raking in money.  Fuck them.  All right.  Well, fuck them.  They got really fucked, and the reality is, I'm not saying we have to give everything  back, but they got fucked.  Yeah, they were too trusting, you know.  Pretty hard to fight.  They were extremely happy when they saw those ships come to America.  Superior firepower, you know.  A little hard to argue with that.  A bit trusting.  Yeah, a little trusting.  And bad in their decision-making.  They came with their maize, and we came with fucking muskets. 
[00:37:30]  All they wanted was new friends.  They brought corn to a gunfight.  Right.  They were like, ooh, new friends.  And we just fucked them over.  New friends.  They were just so excited, like, ooh.  Hey, who are these people?  New people we can hang with, and they got cool stuff.  They seem neat.  They have stuff that's shiny.  Right.  Wow, we don't have to live outside anymore if we just become friends with them.  Yeah.  Whoops.  Yeah, I wonder how long.  Eventually, they're going to change their name. 
[00:38:00]  They will all change their names.  Think.  Absolutely.  They absolutely will.  And I think that would be, you know, just very disappointing.  Yeah, a lot of people won't be happy with it.  A lot of people.  That's why when the whole N-word discussion started and nappy and all that,  I'm like, you got to stop, right?  Everyone has to fight this immediately.  And, you know, fast forward a few years.  Now they're trying to get rid of so many words.  From the English language.  Yeah, I don't think they should get rid of any of them.  Of course not.  It's just ridiculous. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, but I mean, once they change the name, we'll all forget about what they used to be called.  Remember?  Red Storm?  And we won't, you know, still wear their merchandise.  And they certainly won't capitalize on that by making vintage Redskins merchandise.  Right.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they might.  I mean, they might.  They absolutely will.  But it's still, there are certain times, even in a politically correct, shitty environment,  which we hate as people who speak for a living, there are times where somebody comes up and  says something, and to me it just makes sense, even if it's not. 
[00:39:00]  I'm not there yet, Jimmy.  Okay, fair enough.  I'm not saying you're wrong, by the way.  I'm just not there.  Because I just know that people are doing this blindly at this point.  Yeah.  They really are.  There are a lot of people doing it blindly.  And a lot of little college students will go, like, you know.  I just heard them explain themselves, and it made sense when I heard them.  That was all.  There you go.  We're looking at the Notre Dame logo.  The Fighting Irish.  That is offensive to Irish people.  They do love to fight and drink, though.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Fuck.  It's accurate.  Bunch of fucking luscious, those Irish. 
[00:39:30]  Because you think, if you change the name Redskins, like, even though I know nobody wants  to give in to PC shit, what is, how does it hurt when you look, when you think about  it logically, what is the downside to it?  Like, what is it about the name Redskins that means so much?  If history is so important, well, it's the history of the team, then how come the history  of the fucking, like, people it's cartooning means nothing?  Like, why is it so important?  Find me one article from the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, where someone had a problem with the  name. 
[00:40:00]  Like, all of a sudden, it's a new problem.  That's what drives me nuts, too.  Why is it a new problem all of a sudden?  I heard them, I don't, it was years ago.  60s?  When did they come into the league?  I don't know.  Well, there was other problems in the 60s.  Just like, you know, half our population, and the 10% of our population in the great  free country was still trying to get the right to vote.  Right.  Well, then should the Indians change their name?  What do you mean?  Cleveland Indians?  Uh, I mean, eventually, probably, yeah.  It's like, because again, you don't do, if they had, if every group got the same, I 
[00:40:30]  just want people to be treated at the fair.  Sure.  If every group got the same, I would say, no, but you can't do it.  And the owner of the Indians wouldn't have the fucking balls to cartoon another fucking  culture.  He'd be terrified to do it.  But because this one's been here, it is what it is.  The lack of balls by these guys, and the way these NFL guys cave in, everything.  Say something about fucking Cubans, and they fucking, you're fired, you're off the air.  They cave into everything, but you're not giving your sports team a wimpy name, you 
[00:41:00]  know, the Redskins, they're, they're proud that they call their team, the Redskins, you  know, that they're warriors and strong fucking, you know, uh, uh, players like chiefs, like  chiefs, the chiefs, the Kansas city chiefs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like there's two football teams that, you know, I understand that the Redskins is a more offensive  name, but like, how come no one is talking about the chiefs?  Well, they will next.  Yeah.  That's my point.  Yeah.  That's my point.  Wouldn't you just want to lump them in together and just get it over with?  This weird PC world we live in, which I truly believe is a, an extreme minority that they 
[00:41:30]  would, they, they're not going to stop.  That's why you got to fight it.  They'll get the Redskins to change their name eventually.  And then they'll go, all right, let's, let's move on to Kansas city now.  Yeah.  I wonder if they're concentrating on Washington because of where it is.  It's possible.  I want, you know what I mean?  Cause you are, it's a DC, it's Washington.  I wonder if they make the most noise there because that's where, you know, everything, you  know, politicians are.  I get it.  The Redskins is a more offensive.  It's an arrowhead.  Their logo is an arrowhead.  That, that should be a problem, right?  Bug. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  What about the religious fucking things with the, the Padres?  I don't like that.  I don't like bringing religion into fucking, uh, baseball.  Get that fucking shit out of there.  Is Padres connected to any religion or is it just the idea that?  I don't know, that old fucking.  The Chiefs play at Arrowhead Stadium.  Arrowhead.  That's their logo.  But it's funny.  The owners will fight like that.  Like, we're not changing anything.  Throw enough money at them and fucking 80% of them will change the park name.  Yeah, here's the fucking Frank's Bank.  Come to the Frank's Bank Park. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not saying they're perfect.  Those fucking prostitutes.  That is true.  I'm not saying.  Where's all their team pride when it comes to the fucking name of the fucking thing?  Where was Shea Stadium?  Hey, this is Shea Stadium.  We're not changing it.  200 million.  Here it is.  The bank theme park.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Here comes the bank, people.  You're right.  Oh, wow.  They don't object then.  That's a knockout punch by Jimmy.  They'll change the name when it comes to that.  You're right.  Padres' name refers to Spanish Franciscan friars who founded San Diego. 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  Okay.  See?  What about the L.A. Kings?  Uh-oh.  What is that?  Gangs, right?  Gang-related?  Like that?  Gotta be.  I think it's just all ridiculous.  Really?  What's a raider?  Is that a pirate?  Yep.  Yep.  I don't see.  It's offensive.  You're working toward a world where I almost really bombed.  When you said what's a raider, I almost said someone that goes on Yelp, writes reviews. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, you almost said that.  Thank God I didn't.  That's one of the things we talked about in, uh, with Kevin Pollock yesterday.  Uh, yeah.  Shit.  I wasn't going to say.  Is there any footage of Indians explaining why they don't like it?  Like, I don't know.  Not really.  They're...  If you ask them, most of them don't give a fuck either, to be completely honest with  you.  Why are the Cleveland Browns called that?  What is that?  I don't know. 
[00:44:00]  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Honestly.  I'm not going to point that right now, but it is the dumbest name ever.  It's a stupid name.  We're the Browns!  Where does that come from?  Origin.  Answer.  Cleveland Browns.  Mm-mm.  Football.  Originally intended to be called the Panthers, they were named instead for their first head  coach.  Wow.  Really?  Yep.  Paul Brown.  That is so stupid. 
[00:44:30]  At least he's got a cool name, though.  Thank God he wasn't, you know, Paul Kunt with a K.  K-U-N-T.  Silent E.  You know what?  Yeah?  This is why the whole thing is ridiculous.  Thank you, Eddie in Jersey.  The Vikings.  Yeah.  They were not nice people.  Right?  They were horrible people.  Have you seen those Capital One commercials?  They're very mean.  Yeah.  They were horrible people.  So why, do the PC people have a problem with the Vikings?  Are you saying it's selective?  Of course it is. 
[00:45:00]  How about the Moors?  Let's have a team called the Moors.  They're also rated.  And you don't want to cartoon them, so how about the helmet?  It's just an Italian going, ah, with his hands up.  And then Dave makes a good point about a certain boulevard.  Dave, go ahead.  Yeah, why aren't black people offended that all the Martin Luther Boulevards are in their  shittiest neighborhoods?  That's just because white people vote them down, I think.  You're not going to see a Malcolm X Boulevard in a fucking million dollar home. 
[00:45:30]  And if you had a team named the Blackskins, you'd have to have a sideways-pointed gun,  would it?  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  You tried.  Lots of stuff.  Oh, sir.  Tried for a hilarious racist comment.  You're doing so well.  And felt miserable.  I'm just going to love this team.  Yeah, yeah.  I would too, she said.  Ah, yes, you are.  It would be cool to have Martin Luther King Boulevard in a really nice neighborhood.  It would throw off everybody.  That would be funny.  Right?  Yeah, live on Martin Luther King Boulevard.  In a really nice, solid fucking house. 
[00:46:00]  I bet there'd be a problem.  I bet someone would have a problem with that.  People living there?  No, I bet the people living there would be afraid to say anything, but I bet black leaders  would be like, why are you honoring this man in a neighborhood that doesn't give back  to the community?  Yeah.  Yeah, that fucking joke about Malcolm X Boulevard, the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard and Martin  Luther King Boulevard.  There's going to be some violence.  What a great bet. 
[00:46:30]  Let me say hi to Eric in New Hampshire.  Eric.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Are you a Pats fan?  Well, yeah.  Brady has no receivers.  Nope.  You saw that, right?  Oh, yeah.  Jets played really shitty and only lost 13-10 last night.  Yeah, they're in trouble.  But fucking Brady has...  What's going on?  Are they all young receivers up there?  Yeah, I mean, he lost one because he's possibly a serial murderer.  Right.  Serial.  Should be a serial killer. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And his replacement loves to drop balls.  Wes Welker went to Denver.  Yeah.  Brady was having a tantrum on the sidelines last night.  They won, but they're like...  I mean, look, they barely beat the Bills, and they barely beat the Jets.  Right.  And the Jets, you know, we're kind of rebuilding.  We've got a rookie quarterback.  You know, we look...  Yeah, he barely beat...  Just so-so.  Well, it's his second game.  No, I know.  I know.  And he lost to Tom Brady by three.  I know.  And it was three interceptions, too.  So...  He played really shitty, and the Pats barely won. 
[00:47:30]  Anyway, go ahead there, New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Well, first of all, it's great to talk to you guys.  I've been listening to you guys since, you know, Boston, AF, and all that.  Go for it, go.  As far as politically correctness, I mean, I've been sent to sensitivity training for  things because every three used to give up words like midget.  I've been told I can't come back to a PTA meeting at my daughter's school because when 
[00:48:00]  they were talking about special needs and special ed, I was like, oh, what is he, retarded?  And as soon as that word came out of my mouth, it was like, oh, uh-uh, there's a parent  here that, you know, until their child is out of school or out of the school district,  I won't be able to go back to a PTA meeting before just saying that one word.  You got kicked out of the PTA for saying retard?  You're a retard for saying it.  I do believe you've got to be sensitive to some of these issues.  You just don't blurt out retard.  Why don't you just know where you are? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You should be.  Why don't you just stop saying it?  If somebody says, I don't, please stop saying that, you could be like, okay, I won't say  it around you anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hard if someone's kid is mentally retarded to say retarded in front of them.  Right.  If you know that it really bothers them, you can't go, well, why does it bother, well, how  come, how come, Jews doesn't, they're like, well, my son's mentally retarded, you know.  It's hard to argue with that.  You should be able to say the word, but you also should maybe be a bit sensitive.  Yeah.  Somewhere in between, I think.  I don't know.  Well, it wasn't so much that I did it intentionally, it was just, it slipped out and it was like, 
[00:49:00]  oh, you can't say that.  I'm like, oh, shit, here we go.  What do they call the kids with this, I guess they call them special needs?  They're mostly special needs.  But isn't that a problem?  Isn't that pointing out the fact that they're different than everyone else?  Like, where does it?  It used to be special ed.  Now it's not special ed, it's special needs now.  They don't have special ed wing anymore.  Special needs.  I have special needs.  I like being jerked off backwards.  My balls being squeezed. 
[00:49:30]  It's like fucking very special.  I think the goal of the PC people is to make sure everyone is completely treated equal.  Because when you call a kid, you know, he has special needs, that is pointing out that he's different as well.  And I would assume the PC people don't want that either, in the end.  Yeah, I guess it's good right now.  Do not point out that people are different than others.  Especially they'll just be called a normal squared.  Yeah.  All right, Eric. 
[00:50:00]  All right, thank you guys.  Bye.  Oh, thank you.  Bye.  My goodness.  Damn, look at that.  They're showing the aftermath of the fire there as the sun comes up.  There is really not much left there.  Holy shit.  It just destroyed the entire, 80% of the Seaside Park boardwalk area.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  Damn.  Something doesn't seem right.  Yeah, you think the coincidence is a little strange.  I think the ice cream man was striking. 
[00:50:30]  Lighting a match?  You light a match.  And when it's all gone, you light a match.  Well, you light a match and you take the match with you.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, yeah.  Oops, what?  Maybe it was like an ice cream birthday cake.  I'm trying to bang this broad injury.  It's fucking outside in the car.  You can't assume the match is going to survive.  I mean, not survive.  They'll find us.  They'll find the match.  You got to take the match with you.  It's crazy how they find origins of fire.  Yeah.  Everything's destroyed.  They find that accelerant patch, that fucking place where you had to throw down some fucking shit. 
[00:51:00]  They find splatters of it where it was poured.  It's fucked up.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, it really is.  Fire investigators.  Would Jimmy be mad at Blazing Saddles if they cut the Indian scene?  See, the guy who's saying that is...  Hold on.  Talk to him personally.  Sure, sure, sure.  Uh-oh.  We got Rob in Brooklyn.  Nope.  We don't have Rob in Brooklyn.  To answer his question, of course I'd be disgusted with that.  I'm not...  You don't lump me in with a bunch of bleeding hearts who go, hey, hey, hyphenate everything 
[00:51:30]  because I'm not being unreasonable like that.  I'm not saying humor or anything.  I'm saying the difference is fucking...  To call a team that with an Indian face on it is different than mocking something in  a movie where they mocked everybody.  It was funny.  They said niggers in that.  I don't want that taken out of that movie.  I don't want any of that stuff taken out.  Yeah.  So yeah, I would be disgusted if they changed that.  Absolutely.  Just like I would be disgusted if they went back over old footage of fucking Washington 
[00:52:00]  Redskins games and bleeped out the word Redskins or covered their fucking helmets with  a little black thing.  I'm not a fucking maniac, sir.  I just happen to agree with people on one fucking politically correct issue.  I happen to agree with one thing.  That'd be funny, man.  You're such a liberal.  And I agree with it simply because these fucking cunt owners, they fucking backpedal  on every fucking PC issue, these fucking cowards.  This is one they're like, we're going to dig in first. 
[00:52:30]  Let your fucking announcer say, look at that monkey go.  Let that fucking happen.  Or let one of these other things happen.  And let's see how much balls that fucking owner has.  Where's your balls then?  Yeah, stand up behind somebody.  Yeah, tell a black group to go fuck themselves.  Or tell a Jewish group or a woman's group.  How about your guy does a domestic violence joke?  Boy, he threw that ball.  He must throw a good punch.  His wife hurt.  Well, that's the St. Louis cunts have to deal with that one.  But you know what I mean?  Just see.  He's just defending the name of his team because he truly feels that when they came up with  the name, it wasn't offensive whatsoever. 
[00:53:00]  Period.  Yeah.  And that's why he's hanging in there.  It probably wasn't offensive then.  It wasn't considered, you know?  Hey, before Travis leaves, did you see what happened with my poor Islanders yesterday?  I knew you were a sports fan.  Are you talking about the big train ride they all took?  This is the saddest thing ever.  I am an Islanders fan in the end.  I've been a little frustrated the last couple years.  So the Islanders start their season, right?  Uh-huh.  Their first practice, I guess.  And, you know, they're going to move to Brooklyn to that billion-dollar arena, the Barclays Center. 
[00:53:30]  But they're not going to play there until they have two more seasons.  No way.  Before they're allowed to go to Brooklyn and be in this amazing facility.  So the team took the Long Island Railroad yesterday.  A little publicity stunt.  I've never seen a more depressed group of people.  Oh, look at them.  No, that looks terrible.  To check out the new place where they're going to play eventually.  Some of these guys ain't even going to play there. 
[00:54:00]  That's what I'm...  Thank you.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  In two years, you know, a sports team?  Half those guys could easily be gone.  I think they're playing...  Aren't they playing like...  They're playing a preseason game.  A preseason game this year?  Yes, they are.  Why don't they just put them in there?  Well, they're contracted to the Coliseum.  They're contracted to the Coliseum.  Break it for breach.  What are you going to do?  Hey, what are you going to do?  And you would think Wang could figure something out, but...  Hey, Wang!  I don't know the ins and outs of, you know, why he can't figure something out.  He's my team up with the whole smear. 
[00:54:30]  Naked lady pucks.  If you would end to it, he's...  I don't know why he can't make some kind of fucking deal and get that damn team out of there.  Because here's the other side of it.  The Nassar Coliseum, they're not improving the place knowing that, you know,  their big tenant is leaving.  Yeah, and attendance does tend to go down when you know that your team is leaving.  Like, those last few years when the Nets were...  Before they moved to Brooklyn, like, you know...  No one cared.  Yeah, who cares?  They're leaving. 
[00:55:00]  Like, why am I going to go support a team that isn't going to be here?  So the Islanders do this publicity stunt.  They all get on the Long Island Railroad to go do their first practice of the year  at the place they're going to play at eventually.  This beautiful, state-of-the-art arena.  And they show them walking through Brooklyn with their jerseys on and everything.  And all the articles today, of course, saying how bittersweet this is.  Because now they have to go...  Today!  Today they're back at the Nassar Coliseum.  That shithole.  It's been a shithole for at least 10 years. 
[00:55:30]  Why does this look like a special Ed Field trip?  Doesn't it?  They all got their jerseys on and walking around Brooklyn.  Oh, look!  Yeah.  They're holding hands.  Bunch of fucking crazy...  So sad.  And it's not one year.  They still have two more seasons at the Coliseum.  Two more.  Two more seasons.  They really ought to fucking just breach their contract.  Is it two or is it one?  Say.  It's two.  Fuck them.  The 2015...  After the 24...  2015, you're right. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That was on the ice?  Were they fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That looks pretty cool.  What are they going to do with their...  It looks almost exactly like it does.  No, but it's like just the fucking Barclays Center in Brooklyn and stuff.  It's like, okay.  You like the letters.  I kind of like the letters.  They will keep the team name?  Yes.  No, no, no.  What are they going to do with the...  That's a tradition in sports where when you move, you...  You know, the Utah Jazz.  There's no jazz in Utah.  Right.  But they started getting jazz clubs in Utah because of that, but...  I think part of the deal was that they kept their name. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Yeah.  But Utah Jazz used to be New Orleans Jazz, obviously.  No, no.  What are they going to do with the...  I meant the building itself.  Are they knocking it down?  I can't...  I don't know what the fuck they do after the Islanders leave.  Another shitty Long Island flea market.  They only get...  They get a couple ice shows and a couple concerts and then...  And the Islanders.  That's it.  What about the lighthouse?  Meet me at the lighthouse.  Oh, Jesus.  You don't think it's Dora the Explorer on ice will fucking bring in enough money?  Oh, my God.  That place is fucked.  I don't even know what they do at that point.  And it's in the middle of nowhere, so they can't even really turn it into something where people 
[00:57:00]  would go to.  So, if the owner wanted a new stadium and people in Long Island voted no, we're not  chipping in for that.  Including our pal fucking, to my right, voted no.  I wanted private investors to be able to bid on the job and do it that way.  I didn't want my tax money going to build something that would cost three times as much  as a private enterprise would have cost.  I'm not going to fucking throw my tax dollars away because the government does not have fucking  spend money. 
[00:57:30]  I agree with you.  Yeah.  I do agree with you on that.  But then how did they get into Brooklyn?  Because it just happened to already be there and they made a deal.  So, they kind of wanted that.  Yeah, they wanted a new stadium.  He threatened to move.  Yeah.  Are you threatening me?  Yeah.  And the Barclays was like, we'd love to have you.  Okay.  So, they just got to go in there and kind of...  Yeah.  The Barclays, they're like, holy fuck, we got a hockey team in here?  That's huge.  Yeah.  And people will go.  It's fucking huge.  The Barclays Center's blowing up.  Is it nice?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That place is really nice.  I haven't been yet.  I hear it's just amazing.  Yeah.  It's very nice.  I've been a bunch of times already. 
[00:58:00]  Really?  It's really nice.  It's a brand new state-of-the-art...  Yeah.  Yeah, I would like to check it out.  My Islanders will be there eventually.  Another two years.  I don't even want to go to the games at the Coliseum anymore.  Wait, is basketball and hockey...  You're going to go to the Barclays next month.  For what?  Pearl Jam.  Well, do we have tickets?  I don't have tickets yet.  Well, how are we going to get tickets?  I don't know.  Fuck, Debbie.  I got them right, Debbie, right now.  Wait a minute.  You need a pair?  Yeah.  Real bad.  Is basketball and hockey totally... 
[00:58:30]  They don't overlap at all?  No, they do.  So how will they do the Nets and them?  Because...  That's just how they figure it out.  It's not like they pour water onto the ground and freeze it.  They have to learn how to play basketball on ice.  It'll be fun.  No, the Madison Square Garden, that's the Rangers and the Knicks.  Yeah, the Garden does it with the Rangers and the Knicks.  Oh, right.  What do they do?  They just figure that shit out.  They just change the court to the ice.  They put the court over the ice.  They place their sneakers carefully.  Yeah.  They'd be very careful.  Well, they put fucking razor blades in it so it digs in.  That is pretty amazing.  They just put a court over the ice. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Is that what they do?  Yeah.  Someone figured out that technology.  How does it not melt?  Well, the old...  It does what not melt.  The fucking ice underneath the court.  Oh, I don't know.  They probably have lots of refrigerators underneath.  All right.  But the old days, there was condensation on the basketball courts every once in a while.  Some guy would fucking have a horrendous slip, and they attributed it to the fact that  the ice was underneath, and they didn't have the technology completely figured out.  What do they do?  Every once in a while, you would get that.  I'm not aware of the later.  Sure.  I don't know what they do.  But I know they do it in a lot of places. 
[00:59:30]  But it doesn't feel cold?  I mean, the Staples Center, the Lakers and the Kings play in the Staples Center, right?  I guess...  I don't know the Kings did.  But yeah, I guess they do it.  I didn't realize that that was already done.  I mean, fuck.  They just leave the frozen ice under the...  How far under the floor is it?  I'm not sure.  10 feet.  Maybe they don't.  I don't know.  Maybe they don't leave the ice.  Maybe it's just...  Can they lower it or something, or put another floor over it?  Wow, I just assumed they did.  I really don't know.  What's the answer?  No, they put the court over the ice.  I don't know.  That would be way too expensive to try to make ice every time. 
[01:00:00]  I don't know.  No, they definitely put the court right over it.  It'll be interesting to see how the Barclays Center looks, though, because it wasn't built  with hockey in mind.  So, around the...  Yeah, they had to do construction on the seats.  Yeah.  Oh, they did?  They did?  Well, yeah.  It was built for a rectangular basketball court.  Oh.  So, what kind of construction on the seats?  Just to kind of round it out a little bit?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Are you losing seats?  Yeah, you gotta round that shit out.  I'm not sure.  It's still, like...  It fits over 15,000 for a hockey game.  That's huge.  Hmm.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, they're probably not losing seats, but they have to do more temporary seating.  We got a guy in Long Island that could give us more info on the Coliseum, where  the Islanders have to play for the next two years.  And then we'll take a call from somebody else that says, you're full of shit.  Full of shit.  It is so sad that they have this amazing place they could start playing at tomorrow, and contractually  they can't do it.  That takes six to eight hours.  Look at this video.  Yeah.  The floor is concrete, and they take the ice and the court off.  What?  They do take the ice off.  It takes six to eight hours to change it. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, they add the ice on.  What are you talking about?  Look at the video.  Yeah.  That's how it's done.  That's not adding ice.  That's adding the...  They do it this fast?  Yeah, there's concrete under it.  Yeah, there's concrete under it.  And that's the ice.  I watched this fast most in the ring.  I sped up video of them.  Oh, the ice is added in fucking sections.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, just like the basketball court.  The ice is not added in sections.  You just saw it.  It just did it.  No.  That's what's under the ice, and then they fill it up with water and freeze it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So there's an underlay of ice.  But I'm saying...  The ice is always there.  It doesn't stay there. 
[01:01:30]  No, the ice is not.  The ice is always there.  I don't think so.  Watch.  They take it out.  It's not.  No, the ice is always there.  They're putting something over the ice right there.  No, that's...  This is concrete under it.  That's the underneath.  Is that underneath, or is that something that...  That's the logo, and the red line, and the blue line.  That's all that shit.  Look, they take the floor, the basketball floor off.  Right.  Look at that.  It's all concrete.  And now they put all the logos and everything down.  Right.  And then they fill it up with water.  Right?  Right.  And then they put water on top of it.  Yeah.  And they freeze that shit up.  Freeze that shit.  Okay. 
[01:02:00]  How do they freeze it?  That's pretty amazing.  Okay, so...  But I think in the old days...  Superman blows on it.  Yeah.  Could someone find out if in the old days they just put the cord over the ice?  No, he doesn't.  There's no way they would have been able to figure that shit out back in the 70s and 80s.  That's freaking amazing.  Maybe they do it both ways.  Oh, no.  We need someone that knows this shit.  For real.  And then we need somebody else to tell them that they're wrong.  Right.  I want to know the history of that.  Have they always done it that way?  That is amazing.  Refrigerated floor, I bet.  Right?  Yes.  And then they just fucking... 
[01:02:30]  It freezes it.  Let's say hi to Gary on Long Island.  Gary.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I can actually answer part of that question.  They actually replace the ice at the Coliseum about five or six times a year.  Basically, every time they have about a three or four game road trip, they do take the ice down and then put it back on.  No, but that's for the Coliseum.  They're not playing basketball there.  We're talking about arenas that have basketball and hockey.  How they handle that.  Even like the Staples Center or even the Garden?  Yes. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, the Garden is in...  Say they have a hockey game at 8 and basketball at 8.30.  What do they do?  You know, I think it's different because I'm reading that in Boston, the ice stays there.  Okay.  Yeah, this one, the ice stays there.  Yeah.  And they put some kind of like...  They put shit over it.  ...matting over the top of the ice.  Yeah, they probably do it differently.  It's probably well insulated.  Okay.  Probably depends on the newer stadiums probably have the technology to do it.  Yeah.  Yes.  Without leaving the ice out.  Can you imagine if they just did it wrong and like one slip knocked the whole basketball  court 8 feet the other way? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, I see.  It is amazing how much smaller a basketball court is than a hockey arena.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Like, I don't know what they thought about.  All right.  What do we got today?  We got Chris Jericho coming in?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  What is he promoting?  Although he's promoting Fozzy, so it might be Moongoose McQueen.  Oh, God.  No.  Is he really promoting Fozzy today?  He is, but he doesn't do the Moongoose thing anymore.  That performance tonight, I think, at B.B. King.  Very cool.  Moongoose McQuaid, we would call him. 
[01:04:00]  He's been at the Fozzy thing for over 10 years now.  Yeah, it's been like a legit band now.  Actually, you've got to say about 12 years.  Crazy.  Yeah, he's out of wrestling, so he can focus on Fozzy again.  What do you mean he's out of wrestling?  He's not wrestling right now.  Why?  What happened?  He let his contract...  I mean, he wrestled until the end of his contract.  He'll be back.  He was at WrestleMania, putting Fandango over.  Right.  Pa.  Is he still happening?  Fandango?  He tapped out when he started wrestling.  To me, it was like, all right, now the bit's over.  At the last house show I went to, Fandango wasn't even there. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  But at the end of the show, they started playing his music.  Anyway?  Just so everybody could sing along with it.  So how's he doing in the WWE?  He's doing okay.  He's got a thing going with The Miz right now.  Middle of the card.  We tapped out when he started.  I felt like Vince should have kept him not wrestling for a little longer than he did.  At some point, he has to wrestle.  No, the heat was amazing, though.  Right, but then what do you do with it?  To answer your question, by the way, why would Jericho leave wrestling to do Fozzy? 
[01:05:00]  What would you rather do?  Get knocked around by other men or fucking play some songs and get blown?  Yeah, true.  Good point, sir.  He makes a lot of money in wrestling.  He makes a lot of money with Fozzy now, too.  I mean, he can go overseas.  Wow, really?  He does giant festivals.  Like here, he'll do B.B. King's.  But in England and stuff like that, they play big venues.  He should play today.  Well, I don't think his whole band is here.  Could he do something acoustically? 
[01:05:30]  Why don't you just have him sing you a song, Acapella?  I don't know.  I think it would be cool if he played.  Does he play?  Does he play guitar?  No, he's just a singer.  I don't know if he knows how to.  He might know how to play guitar.  I don't know.  I would assume he knows how to play a little guitar.  In the band, he's just a singer.  Big guys look goofy holding guitars and playing.  Like muscle guys when it looks like Hulk doing real American hero.  Is that the one?  You mean badass or silly?  Silly.  Wait, he makes that much of a Fozzy now.  He's doing well on both fronts.  Does he have a hit song? 
[01:06:00]  Not here, no.  I mean, what rock band has a hit song in America anymore?  What was the last record called?  The last Fozzy album.  I don't remember.  You could just check it.  Yeah.  Look it up.  He's your idol.  What the fuck you doing?  How lazy is he?  I would know.  Some fan.  What's the name of Sabbath's last record?  13.  Oh, see how fast that is?  You're wearing the shirt.  Exactly.  Again.  Am I?  Again.  No, I'm not wearing a 13 shirt.  Well, it's a Black Sabbath shirt.  Do you know how many Sabbaths?  I have literally bought probably 11 new Sabbath shirts this year. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  You are a fan.  Oh, yeah, no, I have.  I'm wearing them a lot.  I'm a fan.  And this is not the same as my other one, by the way.  I really like that shirt.  Thank you.  It's the Never Say Die thing.  Sin and Bones.  What are some of the songs in there?  That's the new one.  Oh, no.  2012.  Yeah.  But there's a new single off of it.  There's a song.  I think it's called Spider in My Mouth, Sandpaper.  What's the single?  Spider in My Mouth.  So let's play Spider in My Mouth by Fozzy.  We got Chris Jericho.  Yeah, they're really good, man.  Well, at least play it to the hook.  I hate the new screen, the E-Rock screen.  It's horrible. 
[01:07:00]  You can't see it at certain angles.  I can't see shit.  That's a better screen, then.  Is it too dark?  Is it too dark?  Well, first of all, it's really cloudy.  Why is it cloudy?  E-Rock's very cloudy right now.  Is it sweating in there?  And then it's very dark.  He's giving you the Fozzy CD.  Oh.  Hmm.  All right.  E-Rock's got the song.  So the Fozzy CD is called Sin and Bones.  Yeah.  And the first single is Spider in My Mouth, you said?  Fuck yes.  Okay, let's play a little of this for Chris Jericho, who's coming in in a little bit. 
[01:07:30]  Hmm?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.

[01:08:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  My life goes by in photographs  The images that we hide  My ghost at once invisible 
[01:08:30]  Now buried down deep inside  I read a book that was written in my blood  And embossed it with my skin  I watched a friend drowning in the blood 
[01:09:00]  And wallowed in my skin  To take the drug that led to my demise  And liquefied my brain  Showed me all the smell of the surprise  And collapsed another man  My life goes by in photographs  The images that we hide  My ghost at once invisible 
[01:09:30]  Now buried down deep inside  Now stays around deep inside 
[01:10:00]  My life goes by in the grass  The images that we hide 
[01:10:30]  My ghost that were once invisible  Now falling down deep inside 
[01:11:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show  O.P. and Anthony  On Sirius XM  See, told you we had sponsors  And now back to  The O.P. and Anthony Show  I see no changes  Wake up in the morning and I ask myself  It's like worth living should I blast myself  I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black  My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch  Cops give a damn about a knee-row 
[01:11:30]  Pull a trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero  Get a crack to the kid, to the hell, kid  Some say that Tupac died 17 years ago today  Some say  Most people know that he's still alive  Producing his ass off  What?  He's dead  No, no, he's put out a lot of albums since his death  So he's gotta be alive 
[01:12:00]  Suge Knight had him locked up in a studio  Making him record song after song after song  Yeah  How else would there be things out after his death?  You're right  Oh, listen to this shit  This is a good song  This is good  He's ripping off another song though  Of course  Bruce Hornsby  I like the way it is when Bruce Hornsby sings it  But then you can enjoy that 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, but half his song is ripping off the other guy  That's not fair  He's not ripping off  I'm sure Bruce Hornsby cashed a nice check for this song  You think?  Yeah  No  He was strong  He was strong-armed into giving up his song  That's true  Suge Knight dipped him over the balcony in a hotel  You know you're in for a bad contract negotiation  When Suge books your room  And it's above the 8th floor  Yeah, that's the way it is  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  The way it is  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Do you like the rapping? 
[01:13:00]  This is good, right?  Rapping's really good  Shut up  This is good  Shut up  He did  Yeah, that's true  I've got to get paid  I've got to get paid  Come on  Come on  Come on  And then it gets a little sensitive  He's talking to the community  Oh, he's a little badass  And then it gets a little sensitive 
[01:13:30]  I don't think he was ever really a gangster, though  Like, was he?  Yeah, he was a complicated dude  He had thug life tattooed on his  Complicated? He's a fucking thug asshole  No, but I don't think he  I think he came from money, I think  Didn't he come from  Or middle class  He didn't come from the ghetto  Right, yeah, he had a weird upbringing  He wasn't  But his mom was like a Black Panther  His mom  Yeah  But he was not  He went to like art school, though  Yeah  What do you mean what just happened?  Get upset about his  I'm not sorry  I was twittering something to Stallone 
[01:14:00]  Fucking where is it?  Jimmy's pissed off at Stallone right now  I'm absolutely disgusted  You might want to explain  I think you have every right  It's fucking sickening  He's doing Comic Con  And apparently he's charging fans  $445 for a photo  And $395 for an autograph  $445 fucking dollars to take a picture with 
[01:14:30]  I get the autograph more  Because people could sell that and make money off it  But no one is buying a picture of me and Stallone  Or Dan or open  No one  No one really buys autographs at this point  Is it still a big business?  I doubt it  I mean, it'd be tough to sell a $400  Sylvester Stallone  That is fucking  Just gouging your fans  Comic Con  Yeah, this is New York Comic Con  Comic Con  Comic Con  And by the way  Call him Bruce Willis Greedy on Twitter 
[01:15:00]  Sylvester Stallone did that  Yeah, for wanting an extra million dollars  For an extra day's work  It would have been four days for four million  He was getting three million  He wanted four million  That's greedy  But I get that a lot more than I get  Charging a fucking fan  Almost $500 for a fucking photo, man  Come on  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Your fans are average, regular working people  You know  Who do you think  The Queen of England goes to see his fucking movies?  Prince Harry  You're right  And those are the people he wouldn't charge  I've never charged for a fucking photo 
[01:15:30]  And no one would pay  Or I would  I think we might be able to get ten bucks a photo, though  That could be some nice pocketbook  All three of us  If it was signed, personalized with a frame  Right  They better hang out  Right  That's fucking terrible  That's just fucking  That's horrible  Terrible  That's taking advantage of your fans  It's sickening, dude  It's horrible  That is fucking sickening  Well, with this new movie that  One new movie  I saw the trailer for  He's got a new movie coming out  Oh, he certainly does  Yeah  Yeah, it's called Grudge Match  It's Sylvester Stallone 
[01:16:00]  Okay  And Bobby De Niro  Together  Bobby's got a movie out today  Oh, he certainly does  An old Bomberoo  Oh  Family  I auditioned  This is the one  I think I told you guys  During the break  I auditioned for this  Yeah  I was not great in the audition  But I wasn't right for the part  It was for a mob hitman  And that's just not  I would have had a scene with De Niro  And Michelle Pfeiffer, too  Had I been Dominic Lombardozzi  But I'm not  I'm Jim Norton  So therefore I'm here talking about it  And it's getting one star  Just on 
[01:16:30]  Like, I love De Niro  But he has done nothing but dog shit  Shit  For 20 years  Yeah  And Pacino  I meet the parents  You know what  He was great in that first movie  Yeah, I agree  That was funny  He really was  That was funny  But that was his downfall  That he was good in that  And thought he could take every shit comedy  And throw himself in it  And they stink  How many good movies in the last  You're gonna say 20 years?  Maybe 15  Look  Let's go  The last 10 years 
[01:17:00]  Let's just go 10  Okay  Give me how many  How many De Niro movies that did  That were good movies  Are you  I mean, people like Silver Linings Playbook  Okay  He was average at best in that movie  I personally did not like him in that  But okay  He was alright  He was alright  He wasn't the highlight of that movie  By any stretch  Little Fockers was coming  What?  Enough with the Fockers  I enjoyed Machete 
[01:17:30]  But I wouldn't call it  A cinematic masterpiece  No  Holy fuck, man  We've already gone through  A whole bunch of movies  Be true names  I mean, of films  Well, yeah  Start from the top  Oh, boy  Not from the top  Those are movies that aren't  Right  So we'll start with like  The Family  Killing Season  What was that?  I don't know  The Big Wedding  I don't know  Don't know  Silver Linings Playbook  Liked it  Freelancers  No clue  Being Flynn  No clue  Red Lights  No clue  New Year's Eve 
[01:18:00]  Ensemble cast  That's one of those movies  With the ensemble costs  Yes  Killer Elite  That's the movie he did  With Jason Statham  Limitless  That's the movie  With Bradley Cooper  Jesus  Where they take a pill  And you become like  Invincible  This is terrible  None of these hit  No, Limitless  They wanted it to hit too  And it didn't really  Ages of Love  Ages of Love  Dirty Rock  He was on  Little Fockers  Little Fockers was a bomb  Stone  I think it was  I think the third one  Did not do well  Machete  Didn't see that  Everyone's fine 
[01:18:30]  Everybody's fine  Righteous Kill  Righteous Kill  That was  He played Turk  In Righteous Kill  Continued success  But that's five years ago now  Righteous Kill is now  Five years old  What Just Happened  Stardust  The Good Shepherd  Arthur and the Invisibles  He did extras  Hide and Seek  The Bridges of San Luis Rey  Meet the Fockers  That's nine years old already  Shark Tale  God's sake  Analyze  Analyze this  He was good  Yeah but Analyze that  It's 2002 
[01:19:00]  Holy fuck  We're  Ten years  That's ten years already  Eleven years  City by the Sea  Showtime  Okay  We made our point  The score was good  Some of those movies  Were supposed to be a hit  It looks like  Meet the Parents  And the score  Was the last  Good movies  That's 2000  2001  Almost 15 years  A decade  More than a decade  He's in this new movie  Right Anthony  Well this is the one  That's going to bring him back  Not Family  Which is out now  And getting horrendous reviews  I'm talking grudge match 
[01:19:30]  Grudge match  You're pairing  Rocky Balboa  Hey  Sylvester Stallone  With Jake LaMotta  From Raging Bull  Robert De Niro  Wow  Together  In a boxing movie  Holy shit  And  Making it even more exciting  Aging them quite a bit  Oh  Yeah  Now Sly could kind of  Get away with it  Because of the roids  And everything  But  You take De Niro  And take that robe off  In the ring  And he's  I don't know  De Niro's had a history  Of getting that body 
[01:20:00]  In shape though man  Wait is he shirtless  In the trailer  Oh yeah  I want to see him  Cape Fear  He was jacked up  With Cape Fear  Fucking De Niro  Has done more with his body  Jimmy's talking about  In Cape Fear  That movie's 25 years old  No but I mean  His ability to do this  Like with Raging Bull  But you don't have the ability  As you get older  I don't  25 years later  There's no way  He's going to get  A Cape Fear body going  I don't know  He's  Let's see the trailer  I haven't seen this yet  Two aging fighters 
[01:20:30]  And  It's a little wacky  Certain athletes  Are born enemies  But the fiercest rivalry  Was between two fighters  Razor and Kid  They fought  Razor and Kid  Razor and Kid  I guarantee you  Can either one of these guys  Do a movie without an awful name  Wow  Razor and Kid  Razor and Kid  You don't like that  It's Turk  And fucking  What was the other one  Rooster  Rooster and Turk  It's Tango and Cash  Tango and Cash  It's fucking  In Stallone movies 
[01:21:00]  There's always a bad name  The Rocky movies  Razor and Kid  Clubber Lang  Come on  How about just a name  This is great  It's Bill Sheck  And Henry Snerks  Snerks  With two Z's and a K  Oh boy  Razor and Kid  Yes Razor and Kid  And they're showing the old fighting  From years ago  I guess  Okay  Today I'm announcing my retirement  From professional boxing  Weird  Pause  Did CGI to make him look younger 
[01:21:30]  Is that what they did  I think they did  But he looks old still  Right  Because it's weird looking  Wait go back  Make that  A freeze  Where is that from Rocky 3  Yeah right  That would have been  There's Jimmy's pal  Kevin Hart  Yep  When he twittered that photo  Stallone and De Niro  I wanted to break both of his  Fucking shins  We like the Kevin Hart  Oh  I love Kevin  Sam  You suck  What are you doing  Sam  Oh you just missed the part  Go back Sam  You're ruining everything  That freeze frame  Yeah that's CGI  They CGI'd to make 
[01:22:00]  Sylvester Stallone look younger  Oh my god  Look at this fucking  What did they do to his face  They took all the lines  Off of it  But  They don't have the technology  To try to make it look like  Yeah they don't have that  Figured out  Because he still looks  Old  And the thing is  It looks like him  From Rocky 3 almost  No but that's definitely CGI'd  His face is too long  It looks really creepy actually  Maybe they kind of took his face  From Rocky 3  Like they did to  What's your name  And the Sopranos  That's what I'm saying  And added the face to his  I think they just did that thing 
[01:22:30]  They did with X-Men  Where they just kind of  Smooth it out  Smooth it out  I think they got the same guy  That did our publicity show  Yeah yeah there you go  Let me hear him talking again  Go back  Let's watch it  Oh we'll go back  Oh there we go  That's CGI though  Absolutely  That's my retirement  From professional boxing  Yeah  Oh that's creepy  You know what this is Razor  It's a video game  They want to put you  A kid in the game  All they do is videotape  You throw a couple punches  Voice record you  I'ma kill you  Except in a white guy's voice 
[01:23:00]  Because they don't want  Scare anybody  Okay Razor  Let's throw some jabs  At Wilbur the dummy  Come on Razor  Imagine this kid  I don't look like  That big of an ass  Set me up  That's what you come  At 1 o'clock kid  I want to see my old friend  He's been ducking me  For 30 years  I miss them  That's not what you're  Missing any meals  I'm out of here  No you're not  Uh oh  So they're fighting  In this CGI  Motion capture suit  Blowing up online  I got a company  That wants the official rematch  They're gonna pay you  100 grand  Well I can't be  In the same room  As that guy  Not worth it 
[01:23:30]  The hell you mean  It ain't worth it  I'm looking at your house  I'm your trainer Mike  You can't be my trainer  Maybe I believe  You ate my trainer  Time to train  Oh god  And Alan Arkin  Alan Arkin  He's fat  You got weak knees  You're fat  Don't sugarcoat it  Be honest  Think I can talk to you  For a second  I'm your son  Maybe you could use  A little help  The father son  What are you doing  We're just here to buy  A little dinner  You don't have to punch  Everything  Oh it's a rocky phase  In the meat locker 
[01:24:00]  And he was ready  To punch the meat  I'm going to call back to Rocky  Oh boy  Didn't he have the rocky hat on too  So far though  Honestly I hate to say  Not as bad as I thought  Not as bad as you thought  Not at all  No  Really  Because so far  Even though it's a ridiculous thing 
[01:24:30]  I can buy the progression  Like they're doing  A motion capture thing  Okay  They just don't like each other  And there's some money  In watching these two old fucks  Fight it out  Alright  They're calling De Niro fat  They're not painting it  Like you two studs  Are going to box  So far I can  He's buying the premise  He's buying the premise  Yes  You my friend  Are embarrassing yourself  A great performer  Knows when it's time  To get off the stage  Hello Cool J  Why  He's the black guy  He's the black guy  The whole world's laughing 
[01:25:00]  But we're not dead  In fact I feel more like  None than I ever felt  Razor  Why now  I'm fired  I was born to be a fighter  You got every right to hate  Now it gets dramatic  I need you in my corner  The sun angle stinks  Alright here we go  Yeah yeah  Could you  Could you  There's a couple things  Going on  Yeah yeah yeah  Now the father son angle  I don't like that  The wife or ex-wife  Whatever angle  With Stallone  And it becomes a thing  Where you know  We have to learn from it  They can't just make it 
[01:25:30]  The goofy thing  Where the old guys  Are going to fight  Why do they always  Have to have a message  Because they're dicks  Hollywood's  Hollywood's  Just do the stupid  Silly movie  Right  Two old guys  Beating the shit out of each other  Why do we have to have  A long lost son  Or a son he never  Got along with  And now they're going to  Finally get along  I need you in my corner  Or maybe he's 60  And he dies like the champ  And his 40 year old sons  Collapse  But Kim Basinger  Looking pretty hot still  Yeah 
[01:26:00]  What's up Kim  Where the fuck  She come from  Yeah what's up toots  Yeah looks great on film  With all the makeup on  And bullshit  Yeah  Get that shit  Laying in a bed  Naked  With no makeup on  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  You keep puking  Yeah still do it  You gotta do it  For the story  Ah she's still pretty though  I bet you she's  Still alright  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  I can't write in  That fucking puss  Go watch the rest of this  This is good  Yeah go backwards 
[01:26:30]  Sure  Are you still all in Jimmy  Because now it's getting  A little douchey  With the sun angle  I don't like the sun angle  But I mean the fighting premise  So far  Okay  The sun angle is unnecessary  By the way  It's gotta be said  Kevin Hart  With a couple nice lines  Yeah  Kevin's a good actor  Doing alright  Yeah  Uh oh  Come on Sam  Hit play  You're not hitting play  I hit play  You're ruining everything  We need a person  Can you get Gary in here  To fix the  Oh right  We haven't seen  Hide no hair  Of any of them  I love it  And I'll tell you  What that  Hide no hair 
[01:27:00]  Hold on  Hold on  And I'll tell you  What that proves  He never wanted  To work with us  Of course not  As soon as he's  As soon as they  Told him you can move on  He's out  He's done  We haven't seen him  In two weeks  None of them walking up  Not even a  Hey man  It was nice  Yeah  You know  That just proves  What we said  From the beginning  I love it  That shouldn't have happened  I don't blame him  This is literally  Saying that  I hate Jimmy  No no no  Here's what this is like  It's logic  I hate it  Literally  You went on a date  With a girl  You pestered a girl 
[01:27:30]  Into going on a date  Her friends  We never pestered  To go on a date  Her friend  We were forced  To go on a blind date  You were complaining  To her friend  I need a date  So the friend  Hooks you up  With her girlfriend  Blind date  Blind date  You go out  You rape her brutally  In an apartment  For a month  And then when she leaves  And doesn't come  Visit you in jail  You're like  She never liked me  I hate Jimmy  I just don't like  How he has this  This weird logic thing 
[01:28:00]  It's so fucking  It's so cool  To not have them  Popping up  At the end of the show  It's amazing  I love it  I said my goodbyes  To Steve Blatter  Officially the other day  Did you  Yeah we sure can  And everything's cool  What about with you  And Gary  I actually thanked  Steve Blatter  If you need to know  The truth  Just Blatter though  Yeah  That kind of covered it  Yeah yeah absolutely  The trophy's still in here  Well  It stays in here  Back to the movie trail 
[01:28:30]  Alright  Because that's  Going nowhere  You got every right to hate  But I need you in my corner  No matter how hard you guys work  It won't be your best  It's the best we got  30 years after their second fight  Kid McDonough and Razor Sharp  Get ready to go at it again  Did you hear what his last name was?  No I didn't  I didn't acknowledge  Razor Sharp  Look at De Niro's body  Right there  It's hilarious  Come on  He can't really move  No  And the CG and I  He's CGI'd in this shot 
[01:29:00]  Is he?  It's supposed to be when he's old though  I know  I think it's just the way  Sam you gotta hit play  Oh Sam  What happens with this  And they're using the McElroy song again  It's McElmore  The McElroy  McElroy  Dude how come we can't fucking  Why can't  Why doesn't this just fucking work?  It's a YouTube video  You know  It's very complicated  For a lot of computers  Ha ha  Yeah  Razor Sharp  Get ready to go at it again  Uh who plays the son? 
[01:29:30]  Jesse move goal without a bra  I took a dump on your porch  Heck we are live guys  We are live right now  Oh god  Son is uh  The dude from  I choose to believe that you just called me Webster  Because of my dictionary size vocabulary  Not because of my height and race  Nope it's cause he's short and black  What was Jesus like?  I'm curious  Was he cool?  Oh boy  That's the anti-religious  You don't like that?  I don't go for that  His son is the guy from Walking Dead 
[01:30:00]  He's been in here  Oh right  No I wasn't here  That's his son  That's who that was?  I knew he was  He played here  I had no idea  Yeah  I watched the trailer twice now  And I didn't even know that was him  This is the moment  Oh boy  It does not look like  Nearly as bad as I thought  Actually it's okay  I think it's  I can't  I don't like that whole  Angle with the kid  I don't like the kid angle  But they do look old in it  Yeah  And I don't mind that  They're not trying to be  You know  They're playing two older guys 
[01:30:30]  What's going to happen with the fight scenes?  Yeah  Is there going to be a lot of fight scenes?  I don't know  They don't show any fight scenes of them old or fighting  Right  So maybe they never even fight  Oh they fight  You think?  Yeah  Yeah  Climax  And then  One of them loses  And you know  Whatever  They both look good  And then the son and De Niro have the  I think Stallone wins  But De Niro and son have the moment  So technically he wins  Yeah  Hey you're in my corner 
[01:31:00]  That'd be good if fucking  Like Mr. T came out  Hey woman  Yeah  Did his whole fucking thing  Maybe they're saving that  Maybe  Yeah  That's the little surprise  Yeah Mr. T comes out and says  I heard there was a fight  And then the two of them look at each other and go  Oh boy  And then the credits hit  Freeze frame  Right  And then the credits roll  Oh shoot  It's not here  Where they look at each other  De Niro and Stallone look at each other and go  Not this again  Oh man  And then Macklemore comes out and the credits start 
[01:31:30]  Or maybe fucking Talia Shire comes in  Oh right okay  And throws her hat or whatever  Yeah  And then he takes her hat and he fucking shits in it  And he puts it on De Niro's head and they all laugh  Fuck yeah  Probably not  This is the moment  But that doesn't  That looks like a decent comedy  It doesn't look bad  Yeah  But I'm saying with De Niro  He hasn't  Like Pacino just played Phil Spector  He played Kevorkian  Yeah yeah  Angels in America  You're right  Plays fucking you know  Roy Cohn with AIDS 
[01:32:00]  He's just fucking amazing  And he's doing real acting roles  Very good news  We got two more tickets to  Two more pairs of tickets to see Metallica  At the Apollo Theater  A week from tomorrow  Where are we at?  Yeah a week from tomorrow already  Holy fuck  But we're going to talk to Chris Jericho next  We could do this with Jericho in studio  He's a big metal guy  Yeah you know what  We might just do that  Might be fun to see his reaction  You know what  I think we should do that with Jericho  Yeah I think that'd be fun  He's promoting Fozzy 
[01:32:30]  And we could give away some Metallica tickets  And we got Laszlo coming in  In about an hour  Oh man  He's bringing  GTA 5  GTA 5 with him  I saw the trailer last night  Holy fuck  It looks great  Holy fuck  Can't wait  Looks great  Game in coming out to what  The 17th?

[01:33:00]  I know  I got some new Sabbath shirts  Did you notice them?  I have enough to share  I do  I know you do  I hope he gives us some kind of exclusive today  Well we're going to see the game  Nobody has seen Gameplay  But some info that he gives just us that goes everywhere  Some Easter eggs  Some Easter eggs  Maybe the ending?  Something  Something that just makes us a little more special  A little viral magic  A little viral magic  We have a chance today  Because all the gaming people want a little info 
[01:33:30]  I want to see if  A little tidbit  Is there any familiar  That hasn't been said yet  Familiar voices in the game  I hope not  Maybe  You know  Fobo?  Geez  Can I fucking say already?  No  I know  They make you sign all kinds of papers over there  Don't even fucking talk about it  Don't say you're it  It's really  It's not like  It's not like it was like five years ago  No  You know  It's crazy  I can say this  I was too lazy to return his phone calls  I can say that 
[01:34:00]  I'm an idiot  Yeah  I would have happily taken a phone call  Yeah  He called you the whole night?  I said yeah  And then  You know  I just got involved with beach houses and things  I didn't get  I didn't even get  Yeah you must have gotten the phone calls meant for me  I didn't sign anything  So I could officially say  He said  I got a good little part for you  Why didn't you do it?  A beefy little part?  I don't know why I didn't  No real reason  I just got lazy  I will just say  Think  Walter White

Uh  Yeah  Oh I just wanted to play  The one we played yesterday  I liked a lot  This one's  This one's different  Than the one that we heard yesterday  I had no idea  Yeah  Should we play it right here?  We should  Might as well  E-Rock  Should we play it?  Eric  Why do you look like a beaten man, E-Rock?  Yeah  What's going on?  Why do you act dumb?

I had no problem before that  I know  That's the bit idiot  Oh  Yes it is  He said is it?  Really?  He said up yours  This is by  Giuseppe  Spelled J-O-O-Z-E-P-P-Y  On Twitter  Alright  And it's called 
[01:36:30]  Der Saw  Oh  And it's a cover of  Applause  By Lady Gaga  Oh wow  Lady Gaga  Alright let's hear this  I swear I haven't heard this  At all  No  Is it good?  Yeah I mean  I listen to it  It keeps the bit going?  It's two and a half minutes long  Which is longer than  Sean F's usually are  Oh boy  He does two verses  Oh okay  But there's some nice  Old school references  Alright let's see  Is it like an old school reference?  I mean to who? 
[01:37:00]  Eric Nagel  A  Yes  To the R  I sit here  Eating goldfish  And hoes all day long  And when they need a sound clip  It's the live version of the song  If only they would love me 
[01:37:30]  Even though I play with dolls  Then Hope would be my hero  Once again instead of Hulk  Garlic butter saw  Der saw  Der saw  Garlic butter saw saw  Garlic butter saw saw  I hope for once  They don't make fun of my weight  Der saw  Der saw  Der saw  Every day I sit behind my window 
[01:38:00]  Trying to stay out of the camera's view  All the while I'm giving Sam the finger  Or skipping out to take my daily deuce  I got bitch tits  I take fat shits  Pocket money  More toys for me  I break the door off of my fridge 
[01:38:30]  Then leave it there  Wow  My wife is sick of my attempts to try and bleach my hair  A little shoehorning but funny  The boys say I'm unhealthy  Even though I'm not that fat  But I lack motivation  And Sal's a cunt be sure of that  I wish they would just leave me alone 
[01:39:00]  Der saw  Der saw  Der saw  What a piece of shit I turned into  I'm as buoyant as a big life raft  Every time the boys hear a whale sound  They look right into my booth and laugh  I got bitch tits  I take fat shits  Pocket money  More toys for me 
[01:39:30]  Wow  Think that keeps the bit going?  Wow  That's good  Brilliant  E-Rock comment  E-Rock  Those mean spirits I felt  He's in there  I see him  He sure does know how  And why is the camera back where it was?  I'm looking at the E-Rock vision  Here  I think he moved the camera  So he can move out of frame  So he can back up a little more 
[01:40:00]  Oh shit  Look where it is now  He just hit it  He just punched it  Alright we better take a break  Just to give you a heads up  His finger is on the button  So he's ready to send us to break  At any moment  Oh man  Well he could do just that  He's ready to send us where?  Cock sucker  The O.P. and Anthony Show  On Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The O.P. and Anthony Show  We've got Chris Jericho outside the studio 
[01:40:30]  Yes  He's promoting his band Fozzy  Yo Chris  Where are they playing?  Yo Chris  Phoebe Kings  Yes  Right here in Manhattan  Yes  Nice  Chris Jericho  Mr. Jericho  What's up man?  Take a shoot  With a great t-shirt by the way  Oh thanks  To Paul Stanley  I had to go to the market in Calgary  In about 95 
[01:41:00]  Right  Because I could never find just the Paul Stanley shirt  So it's actually still crackly from the airbrush  That's a solid t-shirt man  Yeah man  It's cool  And you're playing B.B. Kings tonight?  Tonight yeah  And we played the first single off Sid and Bones  Oh cool  Congrats brother  Oh thanks man  We played Spider in My Mouth  Oh killer  Cool  Yeah  Thank you  And me and A  We're talking  Because we go way back with you  Obviously  Yeah yeah yeah  Twelve years ago  You started Fozzy  Yeah we started  Jesus  In 90  Or in 99  Right  Actually so the first time 
[01:41:30]  We came and saw you  Yeah yeah  And did you think it was going to last this long?  It was just kind of a fun thing  That we were doing  I've been playing in bands  Like my whole life  Yeah  So when I met up with the guys  The Fozzy guys  Rich Ward and Frank Fonsore  Who were doing a band called Stuck Mojo at the time  It was just a fun thing  And that's where the whole Fozzy thing came from  We started out as Fozzy Osbourne  It was like a cover band  And then we got offered a record deal  By this guy called Johnny Zazula  Yeah  Who as Jimmy knows  Signed Metallica and Anthrax  Back in like 83 
[01:42:00]  And he was super into this concept of this cover band  So that's where it started  And after a couple years  It was like the original Steel Panthers  It was kind of what we were doing  Right  And then after a few years  You know  We really thought  Like we want to do something more with this  And the whole gag was fun  But it's very limiting  It kind of boxes you in  And that's kind of when we dropped that whole thing  And turned into what we're doing today  So originally it was just for fun  But then in about 2003  We decided we should start  And you're 14 years into it now  Yeah 14 years into it  The only thing we hated 
[01:42:30]  Was that you wouldn't break character  And we have to bring it up every time  Yeah I know it's funny right  Because you guys were the ones  That were like  We were so mad  I know I know  And that's kind of what the idea was  It was  We were doing covers  And it's like  There's a million cover bands  Right  So let's do something different  Like a Blues Brothers thing  Or a  You know like you said  What Steel Panther are doing now  And that's just  Don't break character  We'll do  Actually where I got the inspiration from  Was Tony Clifton  Okay  Who was Andy Kaufman's alter ego  And he would never break character  And he was the biggest asshole  Prick comedian ever  And I thought  I want to do the same thing  I want to be like 
[01:43:00]  The ultimate  You know  Lead singer disease guy  And never break character  Yeah yeah  You know so that's kind of where it all stemmed  But it's hard to believe  That was 13 years ago now  And you've evolved certainly  It's been great man  I mean we've toured the world  I mean Sin and Bones came out last August  We've done 16 countries since then  And played with everybody  From Metallica to Slayer to Anthrax  To Avenged Sevenfold  To everyone in between  That's going to be a dream come true for you  It is  You know when you've  And I'm sure it was the same  For all you guys with your heroes  You meet them as fans  And then you become peers  And then you become friends  You know that's kind of a cool transition 
[01:43:30]  You know it happened for me in the WB  And it's happened for me now in music  So it's been pretty cool  Where's the band really huge?  What countries?  The biggest countries for us  Is probably England and Australia  Australia is where we do the tour  With Metallica in February  And England is where  We kind of do our own headlining shows  At places like BB's  Or Bigger  Just on our own  That's awesome  But the States is going good too  We did the whole cross country tour  Last year with Shinedown  And now we're doing this tour with Saxon 
[01:44:00]  Like this legendary band from England  Sure  We just started yesterday  In the sticks of Pachog  Long Island  Oh Pachog  Oh Pachog  Yeah yeah yeah  Holy shit  I didn't know that Long Island  Was that far away  Like you know we usually go to  Uniondale Coliseum  And it's you know 20 or 30 minutes  This just fucking kept going on  And on and on  And it goes further than that  I heard  I heard it goes even like another  You know half  Another hour  State out there  Oh yeah  So yeah but it was  It was a good way to start off  It was cool man  No one can pronounce Pachwa  Pachwa  Now I just fucked it up 
[01:44:30]  Pachog  Pachog  Hicksville  There's a Jericho out there  Which is cool  Jericho Turnpike  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah we know Jericho Turnpike  Well that's our area  Was that a male prostitute zone  What's up with the wrestling  So are you taking a break  Or  That schedule over the last three years  Has been based around Fozzy  So I'll go back to wrestling  If we have time away  From the band  So I was back for  Actually Jimmy came to Wrestlemania  The last time I was here  Me and Jimmy sat together  That's right  That's right 
[01:45:00]  You put Fandango over  Yeah that's right  You were the guy that they chose  To put Fandango over  Yeah it was interesting  I mean obviously not the first choice  Of guys when you're going  For Wrestlemania  Which is like the biggest show  Of the fucking year  And Vince calls me in his office  And you guys love the Vince invitations  Oh yeah  He's like Chris  I've got a task for you  A task  You don't want it  Like what  He's like I'm going to put you  With this  And he goes and do his spiel  And he's like a magician  He starts weaving  We were trying to get some new guys  On the show  And we have this new guy  I think he's got a lot  Coming to him  He's got a lot of an upside 
[01:45:30]  He's really good  And blah blah blah  And after about five minutes  I'm like well  Which guy are you talking about  Yeah  And he's like Fandango  I was like  That guy  Out of all the guys  That guy  And while he was talking  In the back of my head  I'm like I hope he doesn't say Fandango  Oh shit  And I'll tell you something else too  He got that Fandango gimmick  From when I was on Dancing with the Stars  Because I know he was watching it  And thinking like  These guys are pussies  Okay  You know like  This would be the ultimate heel  A male dancer  Okay  Right  So that's where he got that from 
[01:46:00]  So it goes full circle in a way  Yeah yeah exactly  Exactly  Which was funny  Because I saw you in the hallway  I was like  Oh you turned down Dancing with the Stars  And you're like  Don't believe everything you see on Twitter  But he did it so seriously  Right  Did you see that  I know  I said I turned down Dancing with the Stars  And everyone bought  But not everyone  But a lot of people  But the way he tweeted it  It was like  Now I can finally tell you  Officially say  Officially say  That I turned down Dancing with the Stars  Thanks  Because they were announcing  The new lineup on Wednesday  So on Monday  I said okay  I can officially tell you  I turned them down 
[01:46:30]  And everyone bought  Thanks to the producers  For giving me  For considering me  And I'm like Mr. Fandango  He's trying out for Dancing with the Stars  He didn't want to do it  That's cool  Of course I wasn't asked  You guys are getting big man  You guys are getting huge  Well we did film  A little documentary yesterday  A little scene in the documentary  So yeah  Before Dancing with the Stars  We got things going on  Kevin Pollack's got a little documentary  And he asked us to be in it  Were you dancing?  We're not dancing  No dancing whatsoever  You should be dancing  The best was watching Chuck Liddell  And Dancing with the Stars  That was the greatest  Oh wow 
[01:47:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  He's not meant to dance  We loved it though  And it was literally like watching  Put on the Rich  From Young Frankenstein  It was fucking  It was one of the greatest things  I've ever seen  Gentleman Chuck Liddell  Was really great  We're bummed that Fandango  Started wrestling  Because that's when we tapped out  Because we're not  Into wrestling  Like we used to  When we first met you  But that brought us back in  That gimmick was hilarious  It was such a ridiculous gimmick  Right  But I mean obviously  He had to wrestle eventually  To get  So Vince could get his money's worth  Well the thing is  You know  To continue the story 
[01:47:30]  We're talking about  So I found out Fandango  His first match ever  Is in Wrestlemania  Against me  And it's like  I'm not Steve Austin  But I got enough  Of a name value  That's a pretty big position  For him to be in  And it's a lot of pressure  Because  You know  We've never seen this guy  We don't know if he's any good  If he's a drizzly shits  What  And the fan  You know  A lot of times  When you're wrestling  It's like doing a show  You want to play your hits  So people sing along  And you throw some new songs  And they're kind of watching  With him  He had no hits  He had no moves  That anybody knew  So there was nothing 
[01:48:00]  For people to bite on  Like you know  Right of course  You couldn't fake  Going for the  You know  Stone Cold Stunner  Because there was  Nothing to fake for  So I had to kind of  Construct a whole way  Of building this match  Over four weeks  To make people  Give a shit about it  And I think we did  A good job of that  Because the next night  After Wrestlemania  That guy was like  The most popular guy  In the business  Because they're all  Doing his stupid dance  They had this awful theme song  That sounded like  A dream of genie  It was like  And it was like 
[01:48:30]  A top 30 hit  In England  On iTunes  And I guarantee  A week and a half after  Or two weeks later  Everyone was looking  At their iPhones  And why the fuck  Did I buy this song  Can I erase this please  That's when you get  A song and put  Your phone on shuffle  And you're like  Yeah this is good  This is good  What the fuck is this  What was I thinking  What was I thinking  Exactly  There it is  Your crack production team  Killing it right  It does sound like  A sideways  I dream of genie  It does  It does 
[01:49:00]  So people would ever  Do this  And they'd sing along with it  And about a month  And a half later  The whole thing was  It was like the pet rock  Of wrestling  It was a huge fad  And it just  Just died right afterwards  To where now  The guy kind of  Had to start over  From scratch  And try and build  His way back up again  But for a while  He was a contender  He was  They should have  Waited a little longer  Because the heat  Was pretty  Pretty strong  It got good  A lot of that too  Not to be a jerk  But a lot of that  Is because he was  Working with me  And we put together  Some stuff  Where he kept 
[01:49:30]  Kicking the shit out of me  And it built good  So that's what  You gotta do  Sometimes you get  A task  That you're not  Really all that  Keen on  But you gotta make it work  Sam said you were  The right guy  We talked about it  Before Wrestlemania  And he said  You were the right guy  For him to deal with  He said  Because you're such a veteran  I forget how you said it  But you'll make it work  With him  Whereas some guys  Probably wouldn't have  Handled that well  But you would  I think it was perfect  Yeah I don't know  It's like a lot of  I have a lot of experience  Which a lot of guys  Don't have  So you have to  Use that experience  To try  Like you said 
[01:50:00]  What's the strengths  And what's the weaknesses  And let's exemplify  The strengths  And eliminate the weaknesses  Did I paraphrase you right  Sam?  Yeah yeah yeah  It's like having Sam  On your show  Yeah exactly  You gotta hide the weaknesses  Which is why  He's been sitting in the corner  Of the camera  The whole time  But also I mean  Jericho's got confidence  About him now  Because he's been doing it  For so long  He always had the confidence  But he's not afraid  To make somebody else  Look good  When you debuted  You were dripping  With confidence  Dripping with confidence  Well that's the thing  I had nine years 
[01:50:30]  Of experience  Before I debuted  In the WWE  Working around the world  And all these other places  And that doesn't really  Exist too much anymore  You know guys will go  They have a big  Training facility  Down in Orlando  Guys will go there  For six months  Or a year  And kind of learn a bit  And then they're on TV  To sink or swim  On their own  And when you have  You know eight  Nine years experience  It gives you more options  On what to do  And how to get over  I guess you'd say  But your number one priority  Now is Fozzy  Yeah it has been  For the last four years  You know we decided  In 2009 that we really 
[01:51:00]  Thought we could do  Something special with it  And we've done  Everything backwards  For the way you're  Supposed to do things  But it's worked out great  You know and especially  Whenever we come to New York  I mean the crowds are packed  And it's just been  A really really cool experience  Because like I said  I had a lot of people  Tell me when we first started this  Same thing I did  When I first started wrestling  You can't do it  You're too small  Okay well I did it  Well you can't be in a band  You're a wrestler  Well why  You know I mean  Bruce Dickinson is an airline pilot  But I don't look at Iron Maiden  As the airline pilots band  You know  Is he really  Yeah yeah  Yeah you know  And when he's on stage 
[01:51:30]  He's Bruce Dickinson  And it's the same with us  We've never been  You know a wrestling band  That was running around  Singing about jumping off  The top rope  And spandex  And turnbuckles  And stuff  Wait what kind of airline pilot  I'm sorry  Did he fly missions  Into Afghanistan or something  He wasn't in the military  A while ago  He's a commercial airline pilot  Oh I didn't know that  For an airline in England  Called like Our House  Or something  Some Swedish airline  Active though  Yeah well he actually  He actually flies  Iron Maiden's plane  When they go  They did a tour  A couple years ago  In a big F 
[01:52:00]  As in F  F-16  But I don't know  I'll pretend I know about military  It's an F-16 bomber  That they gutted the insides out  And it was a giant plane  That they took all of the insides out  They put like 30 first class seats  And then the back was all their gear  Palleted  Huge stage  Giant  Yeah  Giant eddy  Everything  And they would fly from  Okay we're flying from England  To Jakarta  Jakarta to Russia  Russia to Japan  Japan to LA  LA to Brazil  And Bruce flew it 
[01:52:30]  Through the plane  He's like Travolta  He's a legit pilot  Well he's nothing like Travolta  Other than the fact he's a pilot  You hope he picks a different  Massage of scenarios  Yes Bruce isn't a closet  Gay Scientologist  We used to talk to Bruce  We haven't had him on in a while  Man  I wanted to talk to him  He's a trip yeah  Yeah I would love to talk to him again  He's a fucking great front man  I mean  I'm listening to fucking  Like Aces High  The other day  I'm like  This guy's just fucking great  Well yeah  Not like him  He sings it better now  Than he did  You know in 1985 
[01:53:00]  Which is even better too  Because that's some high vocals  He has to sing  Why did Paul Deano leave  To get on a weird metal tangent  Why did Paul Deano leave Maynard  Did they throw him out  They threw him out  Oh they did  There's a lot of reason  A lot of alcohol  And plus he just wasn't the right guy  For the band  But I think there's a lot of  Personality issues  He wanted to be the leader  And I think he was an alcoholic too  Oh okay  And Steve Harris is like  Like Vince  Like no fucking around  You're out  And then no  No  No remorse  When you get rid of somebody  I still find it weird  When they throw  A bandmate out  That isn't  You know  Drinking or drugging  Yeah 
[01:53:30]  It seems just a little weird  From where we grew up  Right  It's hard though  Like being in a band  We have five guys in Fozzy  And it's a five way marriage  It really is  And every band has  The alpha  The two alpha males  And you can look at  Any big band in history  It's Mick and Keith  And it's Tyler and Perry  And it's Steve Harris  And Bruce Dickinson  Or you know  Lars and James  Or whatever  There's always the two guys  Tony and Ozzy  That are like the bosses  And then the other guys  Play their part  It's like any corporation  You have the guys 
[01:54:00]  Thank you  You have the guys  That are your boss  And then you have  The guy whose job is this  The guy whose job is that  And if the guy whose job is this  Wants to be the boss  It doesn't work  Well Nigel  Yeah  They're like fire and ice  And I'm like  Luke warm water  I feel like a preserved news  On stage  But that's what it's like  So when you get  When everybody knows  You know  As The Rock used to say  What do you say  Know your role  Or whatever  If you know your role  In a band  It's great  Like Paul Stanley says  A band is not a democracy  It's not a place  For being a democracy  There's Paul and Gene 
[01:54:30]  Call the shots  And Ace and Peter  Or whoever the other guys  In the band at the time  Do their parts  But that's it  Right  And so when you have  A band where somebody  Starts getting too big  For their britches  And starts stepping outside  Of the role  Of what they're supposed to do  Sometimes that start  Causing friction  Which is going to cause  The whole machine  To crash  And that becomes a cancer  And that's when you have  To get rid of somebody  And that's why it starts  I'm obsessed with your shirt  By the way  He's got a  Great painted  Beautiful fucking shirt  I got this in Calgary  At a flea market 
[01:55:00]  I wanted my own  Paul Stanley solo shirt  But he couldn't find him  So I went and got the guy  To airbrush it  And when I first got this  It was super stiff  So it had like  A bulletproof vest  I used to hate those shirts  Yeah  But do you ever have a shirt  Or something where you had it  And you wore it for a while  And then you got lost  At the back of the closet  And you forgot about it  And you find it like  Eight years later  Like this was this shirt  I just found it like  A year ago  And I was like  Holy shit  It's crackling  Like an old painting  It's amazing  1994  Is when this shirt was made 
[01:55:30]  Do you wash that  Or have it dry cleaned  It sounds like a dumb question  No I watched it  I never even  I was too stupid  To even think of a dry cleaned  That's why it's kind of cracked  But yeah  It's pretty rad  It's kind of cool  That it's cracked  It's the Paul Stanley solo album  For those of you  Which are still  The four coolest covers  Were these the same day  It was released the same day  Aces was the best  I think  You think  I like Aces  I like Paul's the best  Aces was amazing  Wait some guy just  Freehand fucking airbrushed  Airbrushed this  Yeah  In a flea market  In a flea market  Do they have flea markets anymore  I mean I don't know  Not as many  They're all movie theaters now 
[01:56:00]  You can just go on eBay  Or something  Pachog  Callback  Artists just don't get any respect  There's amazing talent out there  And they have to  Go to a flea market  To try to make a few bucks  That guy should not be  In a flea market  This is great  You see  He should be doing  Rock and roll paintings  For your house  It's incredible  You see the sketch artists  In Central Park  They make  Amazing sketches  Of people  Just dumb tourists  And I'm like  That guy should be  Making a shit load  Of money somewhere  Instead he's getting  Like what  10, 15 bucks  Sitting on a crate  It's unbelievable 
[01:56:30]  But I mean  How much money  Could you make  How many could you do  In a day  10  So if you do 10  And how much is it  20 bucks  Then there's supplies  There's box rental  Shake downs  What's that  Shake downs  Shake downs  I'm gonna have a shirt made  I'm gonna fucking  Have a shirt made  We got guys  That listen to our show  That would probably  Make something nice  Like that  I'm gonna get  A couple of  Different ones  That's a unique  One off fucking  Jericho shirt  It'd be cool  To get all guys  That ever wore  Kiss makeup 
[01:57:00]  And have a  Vinnie Vincent  Onk man  That would be the shit  The Onk man  The Halloween costumes  Didn't go through the roof  On the Onk man  You were talking about  Your son outside the studio  He's 9 already  My son is 9  Because I remember  When you were having a kid  When we first got back  To radio  Yeah  We've been back 9 years  Well you guys came back  In 03 or 04-ish  Yeah so I just had  He was born in 03  Yeah I remember you  Talking about it at the time  And now he's 9  9  Do you want to 
[01:57:30]  Tell that story  Yeah  I wasn't sure how  We were talking about Sabbath  Sabbath and you brought  Your 9 year old  Yeah and first of all  Isn't it crazy  How long  We've had a relationship  On this show  Like 13 fucking years  14 years  That's longer than  Most marriages last  So congratulations guys  I'll buy you a bouquet  Of flowers later  So I took my son  To the Stones  In June  We went to Boston  Flew up father son  Not much of a camper  Or like a woodsman  And I remember my dad  Used to take me  Camping when I was a kid 
[01:58:00]  And I was like  Ah fuck that  I'll take him to the Stones  That's a cool thing  For a dad and son  And we had the best time  The Stones killed it  I don't know if you guys  Saw them  They're still killing it  Mick is 70  And he sings like he's  He sings like he's 50  He sings great  He's still doing his Mick shit  And doing the  You know  And it was so damn good  And he had a blast  He knew the songs  Because I played him  Some good ones  So I said  Well do you want to go to Sabbath  They're coming to Tampa  And he's like  Okay I'd like to go to Sabbath  You know I'm going to go  And I said 
[01:58:30]  Well Ozzy swears a lot  He's like  It's okay dad  I've heard it before  He plays Call of Duty  And you know  So my wife and I said  Okay well he can  Let's give it a try  Right  So I took him there  And of course the opening line is  I want to see a wild  Fucking crowd  You fuckers  And he's kind of like  A little bit timid  But you know he's getting up  The War Pigs  Is the opening number  And he's clapping with Ozzy  And he's doing the Ozzy stuff  And I'm watching him  Out of the corner of the eye  Because if I look at him  He'll stop  And he's into it  And then about third song in  Was Under the Sun  Kind of an obscure tune  Could be my favorite  Sabbath song ever  Really 
[01:59:00]  Well mine too  Until  They have these big video screens  On the side of the stage  As most bands do nowadays  But instead of showing like  You know  Oh here's Geezer playing  And here's Ozzy  They've got these like  Blasphemous  Crazy images  From like the Hammer  Horror films  Of the late 60s  70s  When there was no like  Code  Right  There was no like  You know ratings  So I was watching this  And it was like  I couldn't believe it  There was  There's nothing like watching  Two nuns  Covered in blood  Jacking off a cross 
[01:59:30]  With your nine year old son  And they're making out too  And so I was kind of looking  And I can see that he's  I remember like  I remember if I was ever  Watching a movie  With my parents  And there was like boobs  I remember when you saw  The deep at the drive-in  With my parents  And they thought  I was sleeping  But the boobs  Were like Jacqueline Bessette's boobs  And that white t-shirt  Oh  Yeah remember  And I'm like  I hope they don't notice  That I'm looking  Because I don't want  To have this conversation  Right now  I'm only seven  So I'm looking over  And he's seeing all this stuff  And he's not really  I don't know  Like Jimmy said  You didn't even notice  Any of this stuff  No I was so transfixed 
[02:00:00]  On Ozzy  They literally could be  Showing my fucking face  And I wouldn't have noticed  But you'd hear the boobs  So then the next one  That comes up  Is Jesus on the cross  With a giant serpent  Circling the cross  And devouring him  Legs up  Like I was uncomfortable  Even if me and Norton  Were watching it  I'd feel weird  Never mind with my  Nine year old son  And it was starting  To get pretty bad  And I was like  You know what  Do you want to go 
[02:00:30]  And he's like  I'm kind of tired  Maybe we should go  But I want to stay  Until Fairies Wear Boots  You know we covered that  On our last record  It's always my favorite  Sabbath song  And of course  Fairies Wear Boots  Come on  And then it was like  Now they've got like  The Jim Rose Circus Freak Show  Where they've got the hooks  In the back of the guys  Traps  And they're lifting them  Off the ground  They've got these naked chicks  Spinning on chains  And I was like  Maybe we should go  So we had to do  And the worst thing was  Was the walk of shame  Out of the sold out  Amphitheater  As everybody knows 
[02:01:00]  Like ooh  Bad father  Bad parental decision  Bad parental decision  And we walk out  And you know  What do you say  Like I didn't really  Know what to say  And my son is like  He's like  You know what dad  Next time we go  Out somewhere  I'm going to pick  The place  Because that didn't  Work out too well  Oh wow  Yeah there's certain  But at least as a father  I respect that  Like if there's something  That you feel is  Age inappropriate  Or whatever  You go ah let's just go  Like you're not  Complaining or saying  They shouldn't do it  He's just go ah  You gotta know your kid  Yeah I respect that  He likes music  And it wasn't 
[02:01:30]  The music was great  It was just the imagery  And one thing in the story  It was the imagery  Which like I said  It was just  And it just confused me  As to why they did it  Because you know  They're not  Demu Borgi  Or some satanic death band  I mean it was their thing  In the 70s  But it wasn't like  You know Ozzy's throwing water  And doing the  Oh like his  You know doing the windmill thing  And meanwhile in the background  There's like some  You know lady having an abortion  Or whatever the hell  Was going on  And it was like  It was kind of  And it was funny  I was talking to Zach Wilde about it  And he goes  I guarantee Oz  Doesn't even know  What's on behind him  Really 
[02:02:00]  Unless he turns around  Unless he turns around  For a drink  He said all he cares about now  Is what time does his show start  And what time can he be back  In the hotel room  To watch the History Channel  History Channel  Still watching that History Channel  Loves the History Channel  Yeah I didn't  I did not notice  Any of the imagery  Like I was looking up  But most of the time  I was just watching  The fucking  But you're a Sabbath fanatic  Yeah  Have you seen them play before?  Oh yeah  Okay so many times  But to go  It was kind of like  Oh this year here  I went twice this year  I had to see them  It was more  The one I wanted to see the most  Was I owe me  Because he's sick  And I'm like  I don't know how many  I mean hopefully he'll be okay 
[02:02:30]  Well them as a band  I mean obviously  I think Ozzy will tour again  But Sabbath  This could be the end of it  Right?  Maybe yeah  I mean I would hope not  The band  It was such a massive success  How was Ozzy when you saw them?  He was great  I mean  I saw them twice  And he was great both times  They did a shorter set in Irvine  Because it was later in the tour  Right  And I think it was the tour drag  They cut a lot of new songs too  Oh yeah  I need a better copy of that  How great is that?  We're looking at a picture of Jimmy  My favorite thing about this  Is Norton the douchebag  Wearing a suit jacket 
[02:03:00]  I'm going to go interview Sabbath  I have to look the part  For once  At Ozzy's home  That's Ozzy's house  Oh wow  I bought the jacket  The pants  I bought everything for that  And I didn't know what  I wore a black t-shirt  I wanted to  It's for their DVD  So I wanted to wear something  That was kind of  I didn't want to wear  Like a fucking rock t-shirt  Right  And I didn't know what to get  So I'm like  Just a jacket  And some black pants  That's huge man  That's so cool  That's one of the things  Like we were talking earlier  About how you get to become friends  With your heroes  And that's pretty cool  That you're in Ozzy's house 
[02:03:30]  I've never been in Ozzy's house before  But that's pretty damn cool man  To think  You know when you were 15  Jim Florentine left me a message  He goes  Remember you were calling England  Jet records to try to meet him  I used to call England in 1981  And now you're in his house  I'm going to meet Ozzy  Asshole  Yeah I can never tell Ozzy  That he'll get creeped out  Yeah you probably shouldn't be  In Ozzy's house  Yeah  That's the second house of his  I've been in  The first one was that  We shot the opening to the special  It was his old house  Wow  In his bathroom  Listen to Norton house dropping  That's the second house  I think too  The first one was much nicer 
[02:04:00]  Believe me  It's a big drop after Ozzy  It goes from Ozzy  To Opie and Anthony  In the next two big houses  I remember an embarrassing  Fucking moment  I went to go see  Saturday Night Fever  And I'm sitting between  My mom and my grandmother  And it's like  You know that part  You happy now you're a cunt  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  And they're like  Fucking gang banging  That chick in the back seat  And I swear  I was just like  I was jerking off 
[02:04:30]  I was so fucking uncomfortable  Man  It was like  Well now fast forward  I can put myself  In your mom's shoes  I'm sure she was  Even more uncomfortable  Absolutely  And what do you say  Like there's nothing to say  You're kind of  You don't want to  Fucking talk about it  Did you say anything  On the way home  I didn't really say  Like you know  What did you think  Of those images son  I just said  You know  It was pretty heavy  And some of that stuff  You probably shouldn't have seen  You know  And he was a dream  Don't tell mom  Yeah  Don't tell mom  Yeah 
[02:05:00]  I pretty much did say  That don't tell mom  But conversely  She had taken  I believe him  And our nephew  Who was 11  To Lady Gaga  Oh okay  Which was  You know  Fire Island  Times a thousand  Where I guess  One of the opening lines  Is like  I want you to suck  I want all of you  To suck my cock  And she's a chick  You know  And they're like  Same thing  Don't tell your mom  And two of us  Raised our hands  And cheered  Yeah so I mean  That's the thing  You know  Like you said  Sometimes  I mean I was talking  To Jose from Octane 
[02:05:30]  And he was saying  That his daughter  Loved it  So you know  And Charlie Benanti  Took his daughter  To Gaga  Because they're friends  And he said  He just covered her ears  At certain points  And stuff  So  You gotta figure out  What your kid can handle  You know yeah  We all grow up  I remember when I was a kid  I was about seven  And I went to one of those  Live haunted houses  My mom took me in  Because she thought  It would be a lark  I thought that we'd have  A fun time  Yeah sure  And I'll never forget  Fuck dude  I remember it as clear as day  And it was 32 years ago  Or whatever  There was a lady  In a bathtub  Filled with blood  And I was so scared 
[02:06:00]  I was just screaming  At this point  My mom had to carry me  And I was like  Probably eight at that point  So I was like  Not like  Not that careable  And I remember  The lady looked up  In the bathtub  And she looked  She had this look  Of like pure compassion  She was like  Oh  And she smiled  Like it's okay  But the lady  Covered in blood  In the bathtub  Smiling at me  Freaked me out  Even with the  Of course  The ass is smiling at me  So I'm sure  You know  30 years from now  When you guys  Are still on the  Fucking airwaves  And my son is on  He'll tell you  You know  My dad took me 
[02:06:30]  To Sabbath once  And a nun  Was jerking off  A cross  Covered in blood  Making out  With another nun  The other one  Was Barbarella  Barbarella  Fucking  Driving  My father  And his  Like girlfriend  At the time  And I'm sitting there  And it was the  Beginning part  Where she's kind of  Naked  And like  Flipping through  Space and shit  And I remember  Like trying  Not to breathe heavy  I was fucking  Like  So fucking  Turned on  And I'm like  This is weird 
[02:07:00]  That was so weird  That happened to me  Watching on Golden Pond  Or the porno equivalent  On Golden Blog  On Golden Shower  Are tickets available  For the show tonight  There's still tickets  Available at BB's  Yeah it's doing great  But there's still tickets  With us in Saxon  It was cool  I don't know if you  Ever do this  But yesterday  I stayed in the Hilton  Across from  From BB Kings  And on the marquee  It said Saxon and Fozzy  And I just  You know  I took a picture  Of it  Like you can't ever  Forget that 
[02:07:30]  You know what I mean  That's pretty cool  I remember  When I was like  I think it was like  1984  I asked for one present  For Christmas  And it was Saxon's  Crusader album  And I got it  And here we are  You know  20, 30 years later  Playing with them  Did you get them  To sign it  You probably should  I probably should  It's at my home  My mom's house  In Winnipeg  But I should  I should  Yeah it's like  Those cool things  That you fucking  Put that in a museum  Glass frame  If I could find  The exact  Crusader album  And get them  To sign it  I should do that  Jimmy thank you  Yeah why not  I'm making my life  Better now  That stuff that 
[02:08:00]  You'll never sell  It's just this  Cool stuff that  You'll always  It's like a  Personal attachment  To something  It's great  It's just like  A job well done  You know  Like a pat on the back  You're still doing  A metal show  I don't even know  Anymore  Eddie's show  Oh no no  I'm sorry  The Rock of Jericho  What happened was  Nicky had his own channel  On XM Sirius  Not Sirius XM  So only half the people  In the states could get it  But that channel  Is done now  So my show is done  You should be on the radio  If you want to do it  Because you're so knowledgeable 
[02:08:30]  I think there's other  Other fire  You know  Fires in the  What is it  There's other fires  In the basket  There's other irons  In the fire  So you'll be back  Yeah it was funny  Because I did 97 episodes  And the 100th episode  Was scheduled to be  Lars Ulrich  And they cancelled me  At 97  And he's like  When the fuck  Are we doing the show  Are you going to call me  I've got this movie coming  I'd like to talk about it  Sorry Lars  I have to wait  Until I get something else  But I'd be happy  To interview for PBS  We're seeing Metallica 
[02:09:00]  A week from tomorrow  Oh at the Apollo  Can't wait  Dude that is great  Was that just  A promotional thing  Yeah they did it  With Paul McCartney  Which was just ridiculous  Oh my gosh  That was just ridiculous  How cool that was  I missed the Springsteen  One they did last year  I got it after seeing him  He was amazing  McCartney  Yeah yeah  Guys playing that long  Know exactly what to do  It don't matter  If you know them or not  I finally went to my  First Springsteen show  A year ago  It was ridiculous  Blew you away  It was un-fucking-believable  I'm like  Why am I not a Springsteen fan 
[02:09:30]  17 fucking people  On the stage  Yeah  It was  The band  Oh yeah  It sounded huge  Like fucking  An amazing performer  He also calls his set list  On the fly  Jesus  Whatever  He feels like  Yeah  They know like  80 songs  And they're expected  You know  It's like James Brown  Okay we're gonna play  I think they did  All Solomio  In Italy  Everyone doing  All Solomio  You guys can figure that out  In like three seconds  Like uh  Yes  Work on it  Who did that with Paparazzi  I saw that one  It might have been 
[02:10:00]  Brian Adams  I saw a weird video  Of Brian Adams  Singing that  With Paparazzi  We'd have all these  Fucking  Oh yeah  Pavarazzi and friends  And the best one  Is James Brown  It was Pavarazzi  And James Brown  Singing in the Man's World  It's really good  Yeah  It was awesome  We played that  On our show  We did  Yeah  I've got a great  Pavarazzi story  If you've got an extra  Couple minutes  Yeah  We flew to India  About ten years ago  We had a WWE tour  In India  And um  I get off the plane  And I forgot my  My Discman  That's a long ago  It was pre-iPod days  So I get off the plane 
[02:10:30]  And you know  When you forget something  Everyone's coming off  So I gotta wait  Until everyone comes off  So I'm waiting  Until everyone comes off  And uh  I notice there's a guy  Beside me  Sitting in a wheelchair  And um  I look over  And it's like  Holy fuck  It's Pavarazzi  Wow wow  So I'm kind of  Standing there  And like  He kind of looks over  At me  And I look over at him  And there's like  That moment  Where we connect eyes  So now it's uncomfortable  Because now we both  Know that we're there  So um  I look at him  And I'm like  Uh  How's it going?  Mr. Most famous guy  In the world  And he's like  I sing too 
[02:11:00]  And he's like  Oh good  Good  Good  And I'm like  Good flight  He's like  Yeah  You know  My foot kind of hurts  I sound like  Was he  Transylvania  No  But  My foot hurts  It was a long flight  But you know how it is  And I was like  Okay  So um  You want a piece of gum?  And he's like  Oh no  It gets stuck in my dental work  But it's okay  You have some gum  It was like  The worst conversation ever  But the best conversation  Because it was with  Fucking Pavarotti 
[02:11:30]  It's amazing  So uh  Yeah  And I had to go back  And get my Discman  And I finally  I was like  I'm going to sign it  And I came back out there  And he had disappeared  In the wind  And he died about  Two years later  So that was pretty funny  Man  Yeah  I remember he had  Total dyed hair  Like  We know it's overly dyed  Like eyebrows  Like black  He had eyebrows  Black as night  He gets that up on stage  Yeah  It looks a little creepy  So what's Metallica  Doing at the Apollo  Doing a full set  Doing a full set  As a promotion  Sirius does this thing  At the Apollo  Where they get these  Kind of like bands  That never would play there 
[02:12:00]  Right  And it's this amazing  Promotional thing  And Metallica's doing it  For the  It's all serving  For just the company  To be honest with you  But we get to  Enjoy Metallica  Oh it's great  What's the cap at the Apollo  God  1100 maybe  12  It's very small  See dude  That is the shit  You never went to  Any of the Metallica  30 anniversary shows  Did you  I don't know  I mean  They had four shows  The Fillmore  In San Francisco  For their 30th anniversary  They played 80 shows  In four days  And they had  Dude it was crazy  Look at the set list  The only song they played 
[02:12:30]  Every time was  Seeking to Story  And the rest was  Obscure songs  Songs they'd never played before  Wait 80 shows  In four days  80 songs  Oh 80 songs  In four days  In four days  And playing songs  That you know  To live is to die  From Justice for All  That they'd never played before  Like all this stuff  Wow  And it was in the Fillmore  Which holds a thousand people  Wow  It was one of the best  Experiences ever  So that'll  That'll be the same thing  I can't wait  I got invited to a private show  They did  It was the night before  But it was like  150 people  It was a tiny club  And it was like  Where 
[02:13:00]  I forget where  In New York  It was  I was seeing them  The next night  And I was flying in that  I was not physically there  The day of the show  I was so fucking furious  But you don't remember  What city it was in  It might have been  Cleveland for the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Where I wasn't going to be there  But I wasn't going to be in the city  When they were doing the show  One of my favorite concert experiences  I saw Metallica in the Snake Pit  Remember the whole Snake Pit tour  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  Where you're actually under the stage  Looking up at them  Yeah that's  And I was on the radio at the time  So I got the good tickets  It was in Buffalo I believe  You know what was cool  Is we played with them in Australia 
[02:13:30]  Like I said  And Lars invited me to sit  In the cockpit it's called  Which if you see their big stage show  They have a big like serrated grate  I guess it's a grate  Where the drums are in front of it  And that's their set  And you sit behind the drums  Oh shit  Which is cool  Because it's the back area  Where James changes guitars  But all you can see  Is if you're looking through a grate  But it's all fucking so rad  Because all you see  Is like the crowd  You see kind of Lars playing a bit  But just watching the crowd  Like there's nothing else to look at 
[02:14:00]  But swimming through this thing  So yeah  That was probably the coolest moment  Of being a Metallica fan  Like we're playing with Metallica  And I'm sitting in the cockpit  Behind Lars  So it was cool  That is cool  Yeah they're amazing live man  They're fucking  I saw them on the Death Magnetic Tour  And it's  They have you know  The stage revolved  Yeah  And you know  Each on one corner  I mean I like the fact that  Lars doesn't want to just be  Buried in the back  Because drummers get that  Whole fucking syndrome  Just being hidden  Right  No it's cool man  That movie's gonna be great too  You guys seen the preview for that  No  Dude it's not a concert movie 
[02:14:30]  It's like the song remains the same  Or the wall  It's a concert movie  Interspersed with this crazy story  Where a guy goes through  A different dimension  Watch the trailer  Sam was here  If Sam was here  And not screwing off  The one time we needed him  I know  It's amazing  He could do the damn  You're one of Sam's idols  And this is like  Literally like me  Walking out of the room  While Iomi is sitting here  Fucking dummy Sam is  What are you doing  Fuck I know  It's been like 13 years  And he said three words to me  I was like  Yeah  Did he like some kind of monster  With the therapy and all that  Oh it was crazy  That was so uncomfortable 
[02:15:00]  Yeah  It was very uncomfortable  But what a cool movie  To the fact they were able to catch that  Right  And that wasn't supposed to happen  You know  That's the thing  I guess they figured out  All their issues finally  Right  They did  Oh yeah  But everyone goes through that  Because that movie's got to be  At least 10 years old  Yeah it is  And it worked  In Life Crisis  They're together now  It's like  And remember the therapist  He was butthurt  Because they didn't need him anymore  I thought he was in the band  He was submitting lyrics  Remember that  Yeah  He was submitting lyrics  It was so douchey  They said everybody can try lyrics  Instead of James  Just write them  And the fucking lyrics  Were they good lyrics? 
[02:15:30]  No I don't know  I don't remember  Sit on the couch  And tell about your childhood  Don't worry  Everything will be good  I don't know what the fucking lyrics were  They were probably really  Really fucking personal  And awful  You know  Nobody wants to hear us  Singing about being molested  It's inappropriate  That was pretty  My mother raped me  When I was five  Yeah  Am I damaged?  Sometimes a donut's  Just a donut  That was brave of the band  To do that 
[02:16:00]  To let their guard down like that  Absolutely  Because you know  Things have changed  Over the last ten years  To where  Ten years ago  That was still like  Metallica's the heaviest band ever  And they can't be human  You can't  I remember there was a lot of fans  That were pissed off  That they showed  This deep interpersonal thing  How about they were pissed off  When they cut their hair?  I was one of them  You were  And I get it now  My hair was super long  And since I cut it  Oh  Chris grow your hair back  It's like first of all  It would take me ten fucking years  I'd have a giant fucking bald spot 
[02:16:30]  I'm sure by that point in time  And it's like  If Hetfield and Bruce Dickinson  Can cut their hair  I think I'm still a metal guy  To have short hair  It's okay  That's why I had to give up on it too man  Because it gets weighted  It does  You see all the fucking damage up there  It does  And I live in Florida too  So I had cool hair  But it was curly  In dry climate  But go to the humidity  It's fucking Shirley Temple  It's brutal man  It would be like  I can pull it down to like here  And then it would go  Boy  I kind of like my longer hair 
[02:17:00]  I just can't have Ozzy cut his hair  I can't have it  Oh he won't  I can't  Ozzy's one guy  I can't have him  Oh wait what are you saying  You had a point there  So ten years ago  Oh I was going to say  It was still so like  So like unheard of  For a band to show themselves that way  Because the social media  Wasn't going at that point in time  And now you can go on social  You know on Twitter  And find out what freaking  Dave Lee Roth had for breakfast  Or whatever  But back then it was still  Like these guys aren't human  They're our heavy metal gods  They can't have problems  And people were so pissed  A lot of the real 
[02:17:30]  Hardcore Metallica fans  That you would see them  Looking weak  Because they're not weak  Like you know they're humans  Like all of us are  But I thought  That was kind of  The last vestiges  Of like the iron curtain  Of what your favorite bands  Were like  But just another ballsy move  To cut your hair  At a time  In 96  No one did that shit  And everyone was like  What the fuck is this about  Whose decision was that  And why  Does anyone know  I think it was a collective decision  But I know they started wearing  Eye makeup at that time  They did  They had Cuban cigars  And Cuban fucking hats 
[02:18:00]  Kirk is wearing  I remember James didn't like that  Didn't want the makeup  And the Cuban cigar look  But was cool  With cutting his hair  And if you look at the last few years  Of Hetfield with long hair  It was really bad  Like he had this one  Where it was a total  It was hockey hair  It was total mullet  And long at the back  After he got burned in 92  His hair just kind of  Left  Jesus  If you look at pictures  Look up Hetfield mullet  And you'll find  See I'm glad you're back  To do your own fucking job  Yeah exactly Sam  Look at this picture guys  Look at that 
[02:18:30]  I mean come on  It's so badass  That's fucking  Don't get bounty hunter  But it's Hetfield man  That's badass  Yeah I mean it's Hetfield  But if you saw that guy  On the street  That's total redneck  You know  That's true  Time to let it go  So I mean it's hard too  I mean when I cut my hair  Oh look at that  That's not James  Is that him?  I think it is yeah  Holy shit is that bad  Wow  Yeah see so  But when you first cut it  It's weird  Because you're used to  Having like this hair everywhere  And you come in the shower  And you're calling it  And it's gone 
[02:19:00]  And then it's gone  And you got nothing  You know  Did you ever have long hair?  Never  I cowlick  And I used to wear hats  My hair was  Do me a favor  Just google real quick  Jim Norton  What was the album name of?  Fuck  Where I had my high school picture  Up on my fucking  Oh right  Yeah  Did you  Despicable?  Disgusting  Despicable  Disgusting  It was actually on that  When he put in Jim  It came up  He just put in Jim  And it goes  Jim Norton disgusting  That's the long of his hair  I'm a sophomore in high school there 
[02:19:30]  You must have got the shit kicked out of you tons  It's almost a Beatles haircut  You're a little lesbian girl  You use humor as a weapon  Almost Beatles  That's not bad though  I had a haircut like that too  How old are you Jimmy?  I'm 45  Okay so yeah  That was kind of the style  Back when we were kids  Was like the Beatles dude  Fucking penis shroom  And there's one little lump  He's got like a little tumor  On the side of his head  Dude my hair would cowl like so bad  It would open up over my forehead  And show my greasy forehead 
[02:20:00]  So I used to bobby pin it in the middle  To make it  Come on  Yeah I would bobby  It would fucking McDonald's M  So to make it straight  Like a fucking Chinese railroad worker  I would fucking bobby pin it  And you walked around with a bobby pin?  No  It was at night  I used to have curly hair  And I always wanted to make it long  I had a mullet but it was 88  So that was okay  But I used to try and straighten it 
[02:20:30]  And crimp it  And it would always curl up  So I used hairspray  And then crimped it  Which fried the shit out of my hair  So they used to call me steel wool  When I was in high school  Because I had the mullet  With a big thing of like  Frizzy steel wool hair  That I refused to cut  Because I was metal  Yeah  Oh yeah  Steel wool  I couldn't do long hair  I would have  But I just couldn't  Put that one up  Yeah see  If you look at this one here  You can see like  The little ten holes  That have been  That have been straightened  Yeah there's a problem  Yeah there's a problem  A few gusts of wind

[02:23:30]  Still hanging around  Yeah  Chatting it up  And now we got Laszlo in studio  As well  Also I just want to remind people  We got Metallica tickets still  To give away  We want to do the Roland contest again  Chris you know Roland at all?  No  I mean  Well that's Laszlo  Roland in the corner  He  Oh I know Roland  Yeah  I just didn't know it was a name  Yeah  He's helping us out  With our Metallica  Here's the problem too  Like you meet a lot of people  And we probably met 10 years ago 
[02:24:00]  And he told me his name then  And I haven't thought about it since  So  Hey you  What's up dude  Yeah  Look at his t-shirt though  Roland  Roland  What's your t-shirt?  It's like Indiana Jones  But it's Super Mario  You just sound like the biggest nerd  There ever took it  It's like Indiana Jones  But it's Super Mario  That's what he sounds like  That's how he sounds  And he's reciting Metallica lyrics  In that voice  So it makes it really tough  To win the ticket  And we're going to do it again  In a little while  Oh so he says the lyrics  And if you can identify the song  You win the tickets  Oh can I play? 
[02:24:30]  We had two pairs yesterday  It took what?  10 to 12 tries right?  Yeah  And all hardcore Metallica pairs  What was the lyric?  Just basic  It's probably something from Reload  Or something that you used  No it was a bunch of different songs  Yeah we moved all over the place  It was really hard  And the way he did it  It was really hard to fucking  Really hard  When is the gig?  Next Saturday  The Apollo gig  Oh that's great man  It's going to be awesome  Laszlo  Laszlo's here  I saw the trailer last night  For the first time  Oh nice  So you did see the trailer  No for GTA 5  Oh sorry 
[02:25:00]  You liar  GTA 5  Yeah GTA 5 is coming out  The 17th right?  Yeah next Tuesday  Next Tuesday  A very eagerly anticipated game  And that stands for Grand Theft Auto  Yeah  I just had to figure that out myself  Oh yeah  You ever play the Grand Theft Auto games?  No but my son is awesome  At Call of Duty  Really?  Yeah  The competition  Laszlo  I have to say  So we've known that we're going to be coming this day for a month  Yeah  TV not working so well  What's the problem?  We brought the Xbox 
[02:25:30]  Isn't it always the way, right?  It never fails  We have shitty stuff here  Yeah  What seems to be the problem  No problem man  Mars  Roland can you take care of this please?  Mars  What's going on?  Roland  What's up?  Get in there  Because I need  Laszlo's panicking  This is when you realize just who you should be paying and who you shouldn't be  Because there's like 18 guys in here and no one knows what the fuck to do  There's people crawling around on the floor  Like Mars is on the floor  Mars is trying to say there's no problem as he's on his belly  Exactly  When you're on your belly that usually means a problem 
[02:26:00]  Yeah I know  You look like you're fucking trying to crawl out of the Poseidon invasion  It should not be happening now  Yesterday I was at the BBC  Which I have to say is like a completely different experience  The studios are amazing  So they have a budget?  Oh they have a  Dude the microphones are like a thousand dollars a piece  What he's saying is they have a budget in compared to this shithole  What you don't think these microphones are a budget?  I can't even get mine to go on  I know  It's falling down  I was on a live show and I said well you know where's how much of a delay do we have 
[02:26:30]  And they're like pardon a delay  And I said well you know the dump button  She's like what a dump button  And I go you're not in any kind of delay  In case somebody screams out cunt flaps  It goes across the UK  And she's like yes  And I said well what do you do?  She goes we apologize  And we move on  I'm like wow  That's kind of a good way to look at it  It's like the cops over there with the bobby sticks or whatever  They don't have guns they just have bobby bits  It's like stop  Or I'll say stop again  I saw a couple with tasers though 
[02:27:00]  They're moving up to tasers  They've uprooted the tasers  They've seen YouTube  They know how much fun it is  It's surely good fun  Good sports  Yeah nothing better than a good tasing man  Oh yes  Those make some great videos  Makes you laugh every time  Unless it's you  Have you guys seen that  The twerking video as we're waiting for the TV to work  Oh it works  The fake one?  No the chick who's upside down  Yeah  Was that a fake one?  That was Jimmy Kimmel  Oh there's an update on that  Oh he made that video  Like three months ago he put it up 
[02:27:30]  It finally got some heat  And the news picked up on it  And it got huge  And then a couple of days later  He went on the air  And if you continue to play it  Which they did  He comes through the door with a fire extinguisher  How great is that?  Wow  Isn't that great?  He totally bamboozled  He had a great reveal  Once again talking about how things have progressed  Remember Orson Welles had War of the Worlds on the radio  And then now here we are with people working tweets  Faking tweets  Mars you alright? 
[02:28:00]  So it's all hooked up?  Oh Mars?  Mars?  Did you get it?  It looks good  Oh shit yeah  Oh boy  What are we trying to do?  Oh man that's crazy  It's good right?  Should I put this on?  Hey look it's changing some clothes  Okay so we got GTA V  We're looking at it for the first fucking time  This is awesome  I need this  The second it comes out  There's good camera work  So they do a different story  Is there a different story for every game?  Yes  One, two  Correct  It's a whole different  Fill us in a little  We have a different  You know it's set in a different place  For each game  So our last game Grand Theft Auto 4 
[02:28:30]  Was set in a fictional New York  Called Liberty City  This is set in a fictional Los Angeles  And in the surrounding area  It's the largest map that we've ever created  It's the largest game we've ever created  It's five years in the making  Wow  And it's bigger than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas  Grand Theft Auto 4  And Red Dead Redemption put together  No  Total map size  Total map  Is it the same main character in every one  Or is it completely different?  No, completely different  You play as three different characters in this  That's in game?  Yes  That's unbelievable  Wow, man 
[02:29:00]  That bitch  Wow  That bitch is getting lippy  Holy smokes  Oh, man  So you play as there's Michael  Who's a middle-aged bank robber  Who's in witness protection  Who's retiring  There's Franklin  Who's a gangbanger  Wow  You see him  He's taking a ride here with Trevor  If you turn the audio up there  There you go  We shooting shit up  Spraying some motherfuckers  I can drive by with the best of them  Whose voice is that a famous voice?  No  So that's  And that guy is Trevor  He's like this loose cannon  Redneck 
[02:29:30]  That in the video  You actually see him stomping a dead body  Down into a toilet  Can you just crash into a car?  Yes  I forgot that someone was even playing this  It looks like we're watching a movie or something  It's like Sons of Anarchy  It really is unbelievable  The size of the map is huge  Wait, could you get out and go to a store?  Can you pick up some cigarettes for us?  Pick up some smoke 
[02:30:00]  Why are they closing the  This is the homie house right here  Wow, wait  Everybody be cool, man  So it's  It's that secret  Yeah, one of the things  Trust me  Traveling around with this thing  That's in game  All the way  It's like having the Stanley Cup or something  Yeah, huge  Holy  You can see you have a dog  You see Franklin here's got a dog  Are you changing the camera angle, sir?  When does this come out?  It comes out on Tuesday 
[02:30:30]  Oh my gosh  Those look like those little fucking houses  Like in Compton and shit  Yeah, totally  Wow  That's Grove Street  This is where  Oh, they're shooting that guy  This is the street that you  Right  That you lived on  Um  Uh-oh  But you can switch between characters in real time  So  Franklin here is running down the street  He can throw a grenade  Oh my gosh  And then he'll switch to Trevor instantly  And then you're over there  Oh wow  So it adds a whole new level  Of gameplay and strategy  Um, sometimes you play as just one character 
[02:31:00]  Other times you can switch between all three  Oh, that's funny  Right, right  So one character could be on top of a building sniping  Providing cover  While the  And then you could bop down at the ones below  And move them  Right  And progress them through  How the fuck did you guys figure that out?  Oh shit  So what's the overall mission?  Like  World peace  Just to stay alive as long as you can  In the drug-addled streets of L.A. sort of thing?  Well, I mean, it's not just that  There's the drug-addled sort of desert and hills surrounding  There's a lot of  It's not just L.A. that's drug-addled 
[02:31:30]  Right  It's the entire southwestern United States  Wow  The farther you go out into the, uh  Out into the hills, you know  At that point they're all  They're smoking crystal  Wow  Can you just run around and shoot people?  Yes  Oh my gosh  Civilians  That might be my favorite question about this  Man, it is really great  Can you just go around?  You could beat their heads in with baseball bats and stuff  Going cheap  Says the billboard in the background  Yeah, there's so many little subtleties  Yeah  To pick up with billboards and, what, TV and radio?  Yeah, so there's in-game television 
[02:32:00]  There's the radio, of course  This is the largest radio that we've ever done  There's over 240 songs that we licensed  Wow  There's 17 stations  Two talk stations  Wow  And the list of people that we worked with as DJs  Like, Kenny Loggins is the voice of, like, the Yacht Rock station  Really?  Kenny Loggins?  He was, dude, he was amazing  I hung out at his house  Really?  For a day and recorded him  He was incredible  How cool is that?  He's got some cash, right?  He's doing  He's got a few bucks  He wrote some big hits 
[02:32:30]  He's got that I'm alright  That I'm alright money  Don't worry about me  Danger zone fucking  Danger zone money too  Your mama don't dance  Right?  Oh, fuck yeah  These guys are running away  Could they have gone into one of those houses?  Some of them, yeah  Wow  But right now they're about to interrupt a music video  Oh, that's great  A music video shoot  Yeah  They're running with guns  Just start shooting people  There's a jet ski in the canal?  Yeah  Where's that gonna go?  Could you shoot that girl?  Yes  You can also shoot 
[02:33:00]  If you jump on the jet ski  If you jump on the jet ski too fast  She'll ride on the back  And scream at you the whole time  And then you knock her off  Oh, wow  There are jet skis  It's like the Terminator 2  That fucking angle  I was gonna say that  Yeah, totally  It's the L.A. River  That's fucking amazing  The L.A. River  On a jet ski  Yeah  This is fucking cool  I don't like the gun violence  I don't either  Can't they be throwing apples at each other?  There's no need for this  Very upsetting  And a helicopter  And again, this is  Parts of this map 
[02:33:30]  It's just  And obviously  It hasn't barely gone anywhere  What if you pull over  And just want to give up?  Yeah, you can do that  Game over  But, you know  We put a ton of different things to do  In the game  There's races  Rampages  Robberies  You can go hunting  Mini games  Yeah, there's diving  You can go flying  There's a ton of different vehicles  I mean, there's several different kinds of bicycles  In this game  There's beaches  Mountains  Forests  Deserts  So you said it took five years  To make this? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, five years  So Rockstar North started on this  Five years ago  They're the ones that put the code together  And all eight Rockstar Studios  Have been jamming on this  For the last few years  I was thinking that they're probably already working on number six  Well, the thing about video game development is  You know, five  If you want to have a game come out five years from now  You need to be working on it now  That's what I'm saying  Right  And the technology changes as you're developing the game  Right  Constantly  And, you know, even during this development cycle  We had stuff in it four years ago  Three years ago  That we were like 
[02:34:30]  You know what?  We should turn this around  We should change this  We  Some of the aiming  And some of the weapon wheel  Technology in the cover  We did some stuff on Max Payne 3  And Red Dead Redemption  And said, you know what?  We should work that functionality  Into GTA 5  And make it for grass  Oh, it slows down  When you want to switch weapons  So you don't miss anything  That's cool  Yeah, why are they in the fucking bushes?  I mean, in the sand  They should go elsewhere  Elsewhere 
[02:35:00]  That's a bad place to be in, man  He'd make a hell of a general, Norton  Get them elsewhere  Get them elsewhere  Let's make like trees and leave  Remember the time we had you play one of these games, Jimmy?  And you couldn't even get the car going  In my house I tried to play  I backed into the fucking fence for eight minutes  And then threw the controller  And you're like, punch  Hey, what about  I gotta ask you about the hookers  Can you go old school?  And beat up the hookers?  Well, you know  You do what you want in Grand Theft Auto 
[02:35:30]  There are always ladies of the night  Okay  But I will have to say  The strippers and the hookers  In this game are  Let me just say  A little bit more chatty  A little more chatty  A little more chatty  A little more chatty  So they might have to  You know  Get a fucking fist upside the head  Anthony, I'm not saying  Just because women talk  You have to hit them  Oh, see  We got confused  Isn't that the message  Behind Grand Theft Auto?  We gotta see 
[02:36:00]  One of the ladies of the night  Before you leave here today  Yeah  Well, you can pop out of this  And go see a prostitute  If you want  Oh, whatever  I wish I had that option in life  Where it just says  Mission passed  And you go have a hooker  There you go  He just passed that whole mission  Right  Because he's got the  This is a dev kit  Oh, yeah  So he can jump through  Nice  Boy, yeah  You're driving around with that thing  Are you afraid you're going to lose it?  We did a show in Chicago  At midnight  And on WGN Chicago 
[02:36:30]  It's a huge talk station  Sure  And when we left that place  There was some people across the street  Sure  And I was like  Here it goes  Here it goes  They have to  They steal the code  You'd have to just smash it on the ground  How could they  How could they steal the code?  Is it  By hitting my weak ass over the head  With the stuff  Oh, until you give us the code  And taking the fucking  And then they would steal it  And then they'd take the Xbox  Wow  So this could get pirated  And be out on the streets tomorrow  If it fell into the wrong hands?  Never  That's never going to happen  How did you protect that? 
[02:37:00]  Oh, we have  We have ways  Wouldn't that be odd?  There's a satellite we have in space  That deletes everything  Seriously?  Sure  Wow  Wouldn't that be ironic  If you got smashed over the head  And they saw the game?  Sounded cool  Oh, beautiful  Now we're talking  Little tatted up chick  She's got the knee high socks on  Yeah, so we've been out  Dude just threw a dollar at her  We've been out on this radio tour  Look at the muscles in her legs  Basically in a different city every day 
[02:37:30]  Uh-huh  And, you know, the West Coast  Is the weirdest place on planet Earth  And we went to a vegan strip club  Last week  In Portland?  Yes  I heard about those  I wanted to go  Because I like a chick with hairy pits sometimes  I heard about those  When she's got hummus gassers  And giving you a lap dance  No, actually the chicks were pretty amazing  Any of them have hairy boxes?  The one serving beer  Did look like they just left a fish show  Hummus gassers 
[02:38:00]  Is that an option on the game?  Add hummus gassers  Yeah  But yeah, Forrest went and got a lap dance in the back  And I said, so what is a lap dance like  From a girl at a vegan strip club?  And he said she was talking about feminism the whole time  Oh, no, man  Did he complain that she tasted like cigarettes?  The good news was she wasn't wearing a bra  Downer, that is  Um, I must say  I don't even know if I can  But I enjoyed lending my voice to this game 
[02:38:30]  Oh, there it is  Oh, wow  I just blew it  I said I enjoyed lending my voice to this game  Well, not only did you lend your voice  Anthony  Yes, there's a song that you sang  Oh, you got the  And you're on the TV in the game  What?  Can you shoot the TV when he's on?  Yeah, like fucking Elvis watching Bobby Darin  So when Opie was turning down Dancing with the Stars  You were doing voiceovers for Grand Theft Auto V 
[02:39:00]  For GTA V  Man, you guys really are getting to the next level  Exactly  We're happening  You got the song that Anthony sang?  Are we allowed to play it?  You know, earlier  E-Rock played the Pisswasser song  So in Grand Theft Auto V  Anthony was the voice of our  One of the fake beer brands in there  Is called Pisswasser  Oh, a plane  Yeah  Oh, a plane  It's like you're five years old  Or Tattoo from Fantasy Island  Wow  Can you fly that thing?

[02:40:00]  Oh, okay  Strategy Jimmy  Video game strategy Jimmy  What I'm saying, the gas tanker's going to fucking  Holy shit  Why aren't you taking off?

[02:40:30]  He's on a plane  On the plane  Oh, there's another plane there  Oh, okay  So his plane is Trevor  And each  When you play as each of the three characters  They each have their own interactive score  Uh-huh  And so  We worked with three different teams of musicians  When you're playing  And the action's ramping up  The music will fly in different stems  So there'll be another layer of drums  That'll come in  Another layer of guitars  And so it ramps up the action  So the score stays  Wow  Interactive  And responds to what's happening on screen  This is fucking amazing  It really is 
[02:41:00]  Oh, look  I think he's got a guy on the wing  I'm aware of it  Can we make show from his point of view?  Yeah  I'm the man on my wing  Did you notice the guy rolled off the wing  And smashed into the camera  And bloodied the camera?  Wow  Look at that  Yeah  Can we see him in the pilot's point of view?  Yes  Oh, that's pretty cool  I would just fly all the time  That looks so fucking cool  Yeah  So as you see  There's a lake down there  There's mountains  In the armaments 
[02:41:30]  And narcotic sectors  For some time  And that kind of requires someone  To purchase our guy  Wow  Very chatty  Who are some of the celebrities in the game?

[03:05:00]  As you can see, there's, like  There's migrants down there  There's  Yeah  There's Hispanic farm workers  I think there's going to be records being set here  So right now you're not doing anything wrong, right?  You're just going in to get a plane  Now let me ask you a question  When you're doing this  Uh, you can just, uh, forget what I was saying  He gets so distracted by the garbage  He's overly stimulated  So you can, you can have your own garage full of custom vehicles  And there's a place, um, in the game where you customize cars  With, there's over a thousand different kinds of customization options 
[03:05:30]  You can own, uh, he's chasing the crop duster  I want to see Jimmy fly at one of these planes  Me, me, how do you get, how do you, uh  Oh my god  Is that a woman?

See, that's fucking hard  Even he's having trouble with it  What's the plane?  He's trying to be careful  So he doesn't bust the prop  Yeah, he'll bust the plane up  Yeah, I know  I have no doubt that if Jim got the hang of these controls  He would become addicted to this game  That's why, believe me, I know  That's why you avoid it, right?  And I would do awful  I would just do nothing that was fun, either  I would stop in and buy a honey bun  While all the cops were outside  What's he doing?  You've seen this show 
[03:06:30]  Honey bun  Alright, here we go  But you can have an entire hangar full of different airplanes  Nice  You can have your own garage  Do you have jets?

I'm on  He's standing on top of the plane that's on fire 
[03:08:00]  How do I run?  A tough guy  What am I carrying?  A grenade?  Oh, fuck  He cooked a grenade in his hand  It was just running  And it exploded while he was holding it  What am I carrying?

No  I read you can  Come on, go  Kind of like choose your own adventure  In some of these missions  Where  Yeah, so there's heists  Where you set up these  Like if you're going to go rob  A jewelry store  Or a bank  Or even just stop an armored car  You set up  You have a sort of a planning board  And you pick the guys  That you want to come with you  You pick if you want to go in loud

What if I take my hand off the gas?  Yeah, up on top of the mountains  Will we find some shit up there to fool around with?  We planted little things all over the map  Nice  To make things  Uh-oh  Interesting  It's massive  It is  It is big  Hard to keep it straight  Yeah, huh?

And so, it's the first one we did set in a, you know, a satirical kind of California  And, um, it's amazing  The difference  I mean, the game holds up and it's a lot of fun 
[03:17:00]  But when you just look at the graphics now  And when we, you know, when we worked on that game  You look at it and you're like, this looks incredible  And it just keeps with each iteration looking better and better  Do they still do updates for the first one or no?  Um, no  Yeah, it's on  You can get it on your iPhone  That's the update  Really?  It's a game that was on a PlayStation  How crazy is that?

[03:21:00]  Uh, Kendra Wilkinson  You know the Playboy chick?  She used to be on Girls Next Door  She's coming in here  Is she?  At 1025  Do I get one pair now?  Let's see the other pair  Man, because I'd like to  I'd like for Roland to  Talk funny in front of a pretty girl  You know  I mean, that's  That's kind of my thinking  It's called my life  Is that it?  Yeah  You're used to it by now?  Yeah  Oh my god  Laszlo, you must be so psyched  That this game is finally coming out  We've been  It's been hard to breathe  Yeah  It's been hard to breathe  For the past few weeks  Have you  I noticed 
[03:21:30]  Somebody on the trailer  With red hair  Have you announced  Who that person is?  Am I not  Who's got red hair in the trailer?  Do you know who I'm talking about?  No  He plays a character  I don't know how much more  You want me to say  Should I not say anymore?  Who's that?  Son  Oh yeah  It's his son, isn't it?  It's Michael's son  Yeah  Is that who you're talking about?  The one that's all speaking hip-hop  Yeah  Can I say who's playing him or no?  I don't think we've announced that yet  It's super secret  Okay  Well then I won't say it  Yeah  But that's something for everybody to look forward to 
[03:22:00]  It's probably not very secret  You know, the internet's been picking this thing apart  Well, I figured out who it was when I saw it  But then I was like  That's probably because of  I know who it is  I know who the person is  It's an exciting radio  I don't know  How many beignets have you had today?  Zero  What are those things?  Beignets or  What's a beignet?  I don't know  Fuck rocket  What are these weird  They're called cronuts  Cronuts  Fuck rockets  No, I think fuck rockets is the 2013 name  Beignets is very late 1990s  No  I've just been in Europe  How long were you in Europe for? 
[03:22:30]  Five days  No, four  Yeah  Yeah?  Yeah, we did  But I was on  I did an ISDN with Kenya  Doing radio?  Yeah, I did a radio show in Kenya  What's the best country for radio?  Because like American  Kenya  Kenya's number one  I gotta tell you  Sitting around a hut  Surrounded  That radio is a magic machine  Because American radio is just  It's shitting the bed  Like there's fewer and fewer decent shows left  In America  As is evidenced by this very show  Are there any countries left that are doing cool stuff on radio? 
[03:23:00]  The radio in England is amazing  It is, right?  The DJs have so much freedom  The shows are so well produced  The studios are phenomenal  People love radio in the UK  Here we've just kicked it to the curb  Yeah  We're on our iPads  Yeah  Yeah  I mean there's better radio in GTA honestly  I hope so  Than there is in actual radio  I have to go do some Sway thing  Have you heard of this person?  Sway, I believe he's on music television  He's next  The cable network 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, he's on Shane 45  I'm late, I have to go  Alright, go for it  Thank you  Thank you  Everybody pick up  It's so weird that you even  Go around promoting this thing  Like anybody doesn't know it's coming out  Like  It's the biggest game in the world  You got everything?

I'm excited for people to lose  You can open up the curtains too  Intern  You can open up the curtains  I think Hookid's going to be stopping by too  He hasn't stopped by in a long time  But I just saw him out in the lobby  He has been traveling like a motherfucker  He's been texting me  Like, you know things are bad for him  He's been texting me  At like 4 o'clock in the morning  Like when I'm waking up  And they're not texts that I'm waking up to  Like I'm waking up  I'll walk out of my bedroom  I'm in the kitchen 
[03:24:30]  Sometimes nude  If that's a little visual  You all wanted to take with you  And I'm getting new texts  Not nude  But new texts from him  Saying, yo man  You doing a show today?  And I'm like  It's 4 o'clock in the morning  I don't know what's happening today  I can't guarantee that I'll make it to work  But he's been like  He sent me one text  He goes, you doing a show today?  I think it was yesterday  Maybe  And I go, no  Norton's doing the advice show  And he goes, oh fuck  My plane  I'm landing  My plane just landed from South Africa 
[03:25:00]  I was gonna go home and take a nap  And then come in  And I was like  Dude, dude  Take some time for yourself, buddy  He's fucking crazy  He must make a ton of cash  That's what I want to know from him  He must make a lot of money  To make this all worth it  I only have some watches  That I look at and like  But are those watches  That rappers are giving to him?  Or are they  Is he making that much money?  Regardless, he could sell one off  And make serious  That's true  The fact that he's keeping those watches  I don't know how many miles he travels a year  Because every other week  He goes, I'm in Dubai  Dude, this guy's not even responsible enough 
[03:25:30]  To keep his driver's license up to date  I doubt  That's true  That he knows what his frequent flyer miles are  No, he doesn't give a fuck at all  Kendra Wilkinson is gonna pop in here at some point  Chris Jericho was on the show today  I would love that  The golf club?  Yeah  Is it Ops?  Yeah, I guess you can have it  I mean, what, no, no  Because Ops doesn't  And Ops doesn't like you  So I don't want it getting back to him  That I gave you permission  Yeah, no, no, no  I mean, we'll keep it in the office  But that's fucking awesome  That's so cool  What is it?  It's a GTA V wedge  Oh, dibs 
[03:26:00]  Let me see  It's a golf club  For those of you who don't know what a wedge is  Like me  They have the coolest swag  With their stuff  Yeah, isn't it amazing?  Like, that company must be making so much money  That they could just make golf clubs  With the GTA V logo on it  Because they were like  This could be good to give away  And it's a real golf club  No, yeah, you could totally use that  See?  It's real  They do have the coolest stuff  I still have the Vice City Stories Coke mirror in the office  Well, I saw you trying a jacket on, too  Yeah  What was that all about? 
[03:26:30]  It's a GTA V  Like one of those high school Letterman jackets  Man, oh man  I didn't get a Letterman jacket  But I did get  I didn't either  But it was just handed to me  Oh  I did get a Vice City  When they did Vice City Stories  When it was like 80  Like Scarface themed  And it was supposed to be in the 80s  They gave me  A members only jacket  With the Vice City logo on the back  It was a light grey one, right?  No, it was black  Oh, yours was black  Yeah  And I was like  This is too fucking cool  You guys got your shit together  Denny came in  Because we are going to be giving away Metallica tickets 
[03:27:00]  If you're on the phone  Stay on the phone  Who cares?  Who cares?  I said two pairs  Oh, I said who cares  I was like  This is  Metallica's like one of the biggest bands of all time  We got two options  The one is  Can somebody give me a printout of the lyrics that Roland has?  Unless they're over here already  One is  No, you need a pair  No, no  Someone's making a phone copy  Oh, here  I got him  Thanks  Roland was going to give me his  And I said  No, Roland  Unless you've got him memorized  You probably need him too  Oh yeah  Keep that  That's important 
[03:27:30]  See if there's one on the floor  So we got two bits that are possible  Roland came in with some song lyrics  And I think we're going to try to have Roland read these song lyrics  And see who can guess it  And if you can guess it  You win tickets to see Metallica  Ace  I'm sorry  The talent department just popped in  She's ready if you want her now  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Bring in Kendra  Alright, give me a second  And then put the people on  She's coming from the other studio  So it'll be one minute  Okay, bring her in  And then put the people on hold  Okay  Just put the  If you want Metallica tickets 
[03:28:00]  Call  And Eric's going to put you on hold  Denny also brought a bit in  He said  These are  Right before I went on the air  He goes  Obi came to me  He wanted me to come up with an idea  I have a list here  Of movies  That had bands in them  I was like  Okay  Well, I don't know what good that does me right now  Almost Famous is on the list  Oh, maybe you have to  Oh, I'll bet he wants people to name the band  Yeah, bring Kendra in  Kendra  What's up?  What's up? 
[03:28:30]  Welcome to the show  How are you?  Doing great  Which one?  Wherever you're most comfortable  Okay  I want you to be comfortable, Kendra  Don't  Yeah, I would get further away from Roland too  Hey  Roland, do you know Kendra?  I trust you  Kendra, this is Roland  Kendra Wilkinson  Hi, nice to meet you  Nice to meet you  Of course, you know her  I guess first  From Girls Next Door  And now you're your own solo reality star  Yes, I am 
[03:29:00]  You're excited  It's my second solo reality show  Right  I had Kendra after Girls Next Door  And now I have Kendra on top  That's on WeTV  Kendra on top  That sounds a little like a double entendre  We do double entendre  Oh  You know  I thought it was a sexual like  It is  It is  No  It is  No  It kind of is though  Yeah, well  We actually spent a lot of time choosing the title  And it was such a battle  Because it's like  That's a little sexual, don't you think?  But it's okay  I mean, that's your brand though, isn't it?  Yeah  I think you trying to veer away from sexuality 
[03:29:30]  Is probably not going to work  Yeah, no  It was perfect  Yeah  And your husband's in the reality show  It's your family and everything  Yeah, it's my  But it's not necessarily that much  This season about  You know, parenting and all that  It's not that type of show  It's actually balancing  Like the party, the fun life  The friendships  And at home life  It's not about me being a parent though 
[03:30:00]  You know  Yeah, I see you going  It's kind of cheesy  I see you going crazy  In the previews for it  In the commercials for it  Talking about open marriages  Yeah  Jumping into swimming pools naked  Yeah  Wearing body paint  Actually, that was a lake  That was a lake  Oh, okay  That's even more wild  It was crazy  Because you don't know leeches and stuff  You don't know what's going to be in there  Yeah  Well, it was cold  So they  Wearing body paint  At any point  Does your kid  How old is your son?  He's three  He's three  Okay, so he hasn't quite figured out  Everything that you're doing yet  Has he?  He sees my tits every day 
[03:30:30]  So, like, I care  He does  Yeah, we don't care  We're so open  We're just  You're a nude household?  No  Well, yeah  Yeah  I mean, yeah  I mean, not nude all the time  We're not nudists  But we're not ashamed  We're very comfortable  I don't see a point in being so ashamed to hide all the time  So what's going to happen when your son gets older?  What's going to happen is my son's going to turn out better than the kids that are being hidden from that  But he's going to realize  He's going to start seeing naked women in front of him  Yeah  And be like, this girl is not as hot as my mom was 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Like, that seems like that could get a little  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but that's okay  I mean, we're all  Look  Are you ready for him to come to the realization that his mom's hot?  I'm beyond not ready  No, I'm kidding  You're not ready?  Or you're psyched?  No, I mean, look  I'm actually a nerdy mom, okay?  You are  When it comes down to it  It doesn't look nerdy on the trailer for this TV show  True  Kendra on top  True  But I do  We're very respectable people  We have a group of parents 
[03:31:30]  We're a part of the parent and teacher thing  Do they like you, the other parents?  Are you kidding?  That's like, we're a group  Like, it's like a really tight group  Yeah  And we're very  I'm friends with the most religious people on earth  Like, I'm friends with the most conservative people on earth  And they're cool with you  And they go to church every day  Like, they love me  Like, we love each other  It's  You don't put me in a box  Right  I'm not a box person  I can relate to every single person 
[03:32:00]  And people  The thing about it is  After they get to know me  They're like  Wow  You know  She's not that type of person  We thought she was  Okay, we accept her  Right  Where can people find the show?  Where can people find the show?  Yes  Oh, WE TV  We  And that premieres tonight at  Tonight at 10pm  Yes  So that's on WE  And I've talked to people promoting WE shows before  And they tell me that WE is not just for women anymore  Is that true?  Um, it's  It's not, you know 
[03:32:30]  It's not like a  Lifetime  You know  Right  It's more of  A bunch of TV movies about Anna Nicole Smith  No  Yeah  No  This is more fun, crazy  Like, it's for both audiences  Really  I mean  You're talking about wanting to have an open marriage  In the preview for this show  Yeah  Yeah  But it doesn't really work like that  If you're really talking about it  You know  We  We just  Set it  And, um  And then the network was like  This is a fantastic clip  Sure  Plaster everywhere  Sure  Have you tried having open relationships before? 
[03:33:00]  Well, I mean, half  Half, yeah  But I guess it's not  I mean  Yeah  Was that really  Do you count that as a relationship?  No  No, he's a really good friend of mine  But he was always just kind of  Yeah  It was a business arrangement, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was more like that  Yeah  But it was a lot of fun  I had a great time there  Did you?  With  Only half  Myself  Right  How long did it take for you to explain  To your current husband  What that relationship was all about?  Did he get it from the beginning?  Like, oh, okay  It's one of those things  Yeah 
[03:33:30]  I mean, he knew about it  Because, of course, we met  At the Playboy  Actually, the Playboy Golf Scramble  And he  He knew he wanted to meet me  And he understood  And all that  But it's still  The reality sets in  You know  When you're really with that person  And I really did have to  Just let all my skeletons out of the closet  Just like I did this season  So I had to just  This is who I dated  This is who I was with  This is what happened  So I really had to  You know  Be upfront about a lot  Either you like it or you don't  Either you accept it or you don't

Well that's what I was telling her  Like she's going to  The issue that I'm worried about 
[03:34:30]  With her kid  Is that you know  She's walking around naked  In front of the kid  And you tell me  If you think this is right on  One day  The kid's going to get older  Right?  And he's going to see  Naked women in front of him  And he's going to say  That chick is not as hot  As my mother was  And  And you know  You get to a weird predicament  Heck I see my mother naked  And you know  My mother's not you  Like  Because you know  Who Kid told me this  Very strange story  And this is why you got to watch out for your kid  Because you don't want a weirdo  You don't want him growing up like this guy  Because Who Kid's a weird 
[03:35:00]  A weird dude  Very strange  He's texting me at 4 o'clock in the morning  Nobody texts at 4 o'clock in the morning  Unless they're weirdo  Do you remember seeing your mom naked growing up?  Oh  She had this very sagging big African boot  Tell her where you saw your mom naked  Multiple places  He used to  Are you married right now?  Unfortunately yes  Oh you are?  Are you  But do you cheat?  I'm not married with her around  Right  Okay  So does she look like  What your mom  No  My wife is Japanese 
[03:35:30]  But my mother is Haitian  He used to  This is what he used to do  He told me  He used to  When his mom was in the bathroom  Lay down on the floor  And peek through the crack under the door  So he could see  My son does that  He looks at you  Go to the bathroom  Like Hank and I will be in the shower  Sorry  Go ahead  Hank you were in the shower  Go  Get out of here  Yeah  Yeah  I mean but who could just look at his mom on the toilet  If I had a boner though  You did  Hey  Hey 
[03:36:00]  My son  Hey he goes  The other day  Because you know  We had to pee together  You know  It's like  We had to go to the bathroom together  And one day he looks over  He goes  Mama  Why do you pee out of your butt  I'm like  Oh my god  Do you have two toilets  That's not shit right here  How do you pee together  Say if you go to a public bathroom  Oh  Like you can't like let the kid go  Gotcha  Okay  I thought you meant in your house  You had like a little toilet for him  No  Like a public bathroom  Or like a  You know  Like a museum park bathroom  Or something  Gotcha  But it's different with her  It's love  It's like you know  Husband  Child  Yeah  I don't think  I think there is  I was a perv  You were just a little weirdo 
[03:36:30]  I was a young kid  And I didn't know what a vagina was  And my mother had a really big one  Oh my god  She did  So I had to go and examine  Oh god  I guess  Oh  Because I've seen Kendra  On her other shows  This is now her third reality show  You heard of it  Kendra on top  Yeah  Is premiering tonight on  We  I like that title too  You get it right  You get what's going on  I mean you know  I'm not on bottom anymore  I'm on top  Right  Right  Before she used to only be on bottom  Now  I move positions  Yes  Next one will be  What's it called  On the side 
[03:37:00]  Doggy stall  Yeah  Kendra versus cowgirl  It's like  Yeah  It's a double entendre  It doesn't mean what you're thinking  It means  Are you a  Are you a Metallica fan at all  I am  You are  Yeah  Well  I want you to be a part of this  For a little bit  Okay  This is Roland  You met Roland  She didn't really want to sit next to Roland  I guess I did  When she came in  There was hesitation  I didn't know if he wanted to sit next to me  That was the issue  I think he was okay with it  As soon as he says  Moisture  Yeah  It's very wet on that side 
[03:37:30]  It is  It is  Oh my god  Well  Metallica  A week from today  Is that  Or a week from tomorrow  Yeah  A week from tomorrow  Metallica is doing a show  At the Apollo Theater  And I don't know if you  I know you've been to the Apollo Theater  I don't know if  What is that  You've been to the Apollo Theater  I'm a black woman  But it's this  It's a theater in Harlem  And it seats like  11 or 1200 people  It's this tiny little place  And Metallica's playing there  For Sirius XM  Okay  So it's like this huge deal  Uh huh  So people want to go see them  Very badly  And we have three pairs of tickets 
[03:38:00]  To give away  Me?  I'm not giving  Do you want to go?  Yeah  Do you live in New York?  No  But okay  Will you come to New York next weekend?  I could probably get you in  I'm just kidding  I mean you've got a reality show  I've never been to a heavy metal concert  I really actually want to go to one  If you're going to go to a heavy metal concert  The place to start is the Apollo  Right?  That's kind of like  A very odd experience  To go to like  I don't know  Yeah  It's kind of weird  Apollo is known for entertaining  Black audiences  Historically  So this whole  This whole cross culture thing  So who are the three tickets going to? 
[03:38:30]  Well  Three pairs of tickets  Going to some lucky listeners  Those three pairs  I got it  But the only way to win  Is to figure out what Metallica song  Roland is reading song lyrics from  Oh shit  Now I don't know if you gathered this from Roland  Talking is not as strong  Roland if you could say something to Kendra  I have to guess?  No you don't have to guess  The audience does  I just want you to be here for it  Oh got it  Got it  Got it  Like Roland  Plug Kendra's reality show  It premieres tonight  On Wii  At 10pm 
[03:39:00]  Um  Watch her show  Go ahead and promote Metallica okay  So  So  This is why I'm not  I love you  I really love you  I'm gonna  I'm gonna go down the line  And we'll start with Kevin in Philly  I hope he loses  Kevin you there?  Yeah I'm here  Alright Roland  You're gonna read the first set of lyrics  Yeah  Are you ready?

[03:40:00]  Kendra did you even know  What Roland was saying?  I actually got really nervous  I was like  Is he okay?  Like are you  Yeah you thought this was some kind of  Al-Qaeda shouting or something  I don't understand this language  That's what Metallica sounds like to me  It does  Who could you worry about  Maybe satanic cult rituals  Or something?  I don't listen to Metallica  I never heard of them  So that's what I hear  You also can't  That's what I hear  It sounds like to me  Like  Right  Right  Well that's what everybody else is hearing out there right now  Let's go to  Is it only two pairs or three pairs?  I heard three 
[03:40:30]  Eric three right?  No two  Two  Who told me three?  Somebody told me three  I don't know  Alright we're just giving two then  Yeah  So Sean  I don't have the pairs in my hand  Otherwise I would just count  Oh hold on  We do have three  Travis miscounted  So we do have three  See  I know it was three  Kendra  If you need to figure out who to trust in the room  Go with Sam Roberts  So it is three  Sean in New York  Yeah hi Sam  Alright now you know  I mean obviously you're in New York  But we're not providing transportation  So you can get to the Apollo  Yes I'm in Long Island

Sean?  What the hell was that?  Exactly  My phone is just  Echo  Alright Sean you don't know do you? 
[03:41:30]  I think he said negative  Yeah negative  Okay do you really not know the songs?  I have no clue  You're just going  No I was just a Springsteen fan  I have no idea  So you don't know how it's like  I know zero  But even if he did  Do you think it would do any good?  Honestly Kendra  Do you think that's the problem here?  Oh my god  All right let me go to  I lost the phone banks in here  I can't pick them up  You don't have the screen at all?

[03:54:00]  That's the last time I saw you  This is another way  Like maybe this is what my problem is  Is how I know I'm just a nerd  Number one  Because Kendra's in here  Telling me what guys she thinks are hot  And I'm not on that list  And number two  Because  I was at the VMA after party  InTouch magazine was putting it on  Yeah  And  I was there  And I was there with Troy  And Nick Cannon was DJing  And I was hanging out with him  And Ronnie from Jersey Shore was there  And I was hanging out with him  And I see Who Kid roll up  And I was like  Oh shit  And so I walked over to him 
[03:54:30]  And I tapped him on the shoulder  And he turned around  And first  You know  Because there's a lot of people in the club  And everybody's tapping Who Kid  He had the kind of distant look in his eyes  Like not really focused on anything  Like just kind of  You know  Who's tapping on my shoulder now  I'm king shit around here  And then he  And then he came down  And saw it was me  And he goes  Oh shit  You go out  I was like yes  I leave the house from time to time  That's what I got  I was shocked  You were  I felt like somebody just 
[03:55:00]  Threw pussy at me or something  You felt that good?  I was like wow  Fucking Sam is out  It's about  I was worried  Because I thought for a second  And this is just my low self esteem  Which was added on to  By Kendra Wilkinson today  That I thought that you were going to sit there  Being like oh  This is a lame ass party  I didn't realize  This was popping in there  I knew everybody  It was a popping party  Wasn't it  I knew every white person in there  It was hot  It was a fun time  But then like for me  Roll it as an idiot  That's the last time I was at any sort of 
[03:55:30]  Oh for real  Get together club party thing  I tried to get him to come out  And then you know  To hang out with me and Dave Chappelle  Cause you know  Dave Chappelle  You hung out with Dave Chappelle the other night  Because we work out now together  You know  You don't work out with Dave Chappelle  He was looking jacked  That's what I'm saying  We took pills and everything  Like it was crazy  So you  Where did you see Dave Chappelle?  It was at this club called Whip  He came just to hang out  And then I was like  Yo come through  I got him through the security check  And then we did like  30 push ups  In the back 
[03:56:00]  Cause you know  They got a section in the back  Where  You really did?  Yeah  Where the giants smoke weed at  They do  And then sports stars hang out  Or VIP  And comedians go to do push ups  I'm like yo it was like  Two in the morning  So we worked out  So if the giants lose  This is why  Did I snitch  All of New York City?  Yeah  Whoops  Man  So are you  Shit I was snitch  Are you cool with Chappelle now?  Super cool  I think I did 60 push ups  And I did like  I was in a club 
[03:56:30]  And I drank  Ciroc and shit  Is that his shit now  Working out?  Yeah I did 30 sit ups with him  He held my legs  I held his legs  Was he weird at all?  Everybody says he's nuts  No he was cool  He was running everywhere  But you know  I had him in a headlock  We chilled  You put him in a headlock  It must be difficult for him  To go to a club like that  Like was everybody just being like  Oh shit Dave Chappelle  Dave Chappelle  Dave Chappelle  Fuck the fuck out  Like what the fuck  You know  People  It's like  If he will walk by you  You know his head is the same  Right  The body's diesel  Cause he's wearing this  Dave Chappelle was wearing  Like a tank top wife beater 
[03:57:00]  Yeah  And I guess he's been working out  Like crazy  Cause he's got these massive arms  And shoulders  And everything now  He doesn't even look like  He looks like Dave Chappelle's head  On another person's body  That's exactly  But imagine like  You're in a club  And you look at the VIP section  Everybody's working out there  Like he's  Yeah  He's getting like  He's doing sit ups  People holding his legs  Was he drinking or no?  Yeah the crazy Jordans  What was that?  Was he drinking or no?  No he wasn't drinking  I think  Wow so he's  Just exercising  He was half baked  I'll tell you that  Yeah  Just like the god damn movie  That's right  But come on  It's Dave Chappelle 
[03:57:30]  He likes to smoke weed  And he didn't go to Africa  He said  What's this Africa shit?  He didn't go  He said he never went  You just came back  From South Africa  Correct?  I was in South Africa  But I went there  You know  Well we only got  A couple minutes left  Who Kid  And there was something  I wanted to ask you about  Even before you came in here  I'm glad you're finally here  I wanted to know  Would you  Who Kid  Eat a fake apple  Made from fillers  And preservatives  Yeah of course  Well I wouldn't  I don't know why you would  I'm stupid  Oh  Good point
