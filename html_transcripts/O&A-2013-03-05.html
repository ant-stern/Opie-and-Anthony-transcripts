<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics throughout the broadcast.  The show opened with a discussion about the growing concerns surrounding civilian drone use, spurred by a drone sighting near JFK airport.  The hosts speculated on the potential for misuse, including terrorism, smuggling contraband into prisons, and targeting public figures.  They contrasted this with legitimate commercial uses like photography and building inspections, acknowledging the ongoing legal battles surrounding drone regulation.  One host's experience with aerial photography and the other's with model rocketry (including a humorous anecdote about a flash powder-filled rocket damaging a neighbor's roof) were woven into the conversation.  This segment also briefly touched upon Miss Teen Delaware's involvement in pornography and a wrestling-related news item.

Next, Opie expressed frustration with excessive listener praise for Sam Roberts. The conversation then shifted to Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" and a graphic analysis of a pornographic video featuring Miss Delaware, Melissa King.  Travis joined the hosts in providing detailed commentary on King's appearance and performance, focusing on specific physical attributes and sounds during the act.  The hosts further dissected social media reactions to the video, including supportive, hateful, and "white knight" comments, and joked about their attempts to attract King's attention on Twitter.  The discussion briefly turned to Casey Anthony's bankruptcy filing, with Opie jokingly offering Anthony a place to stay. The segment concluded with a discussion of VICE documentaries on Liberia and the Congo, detailing the extreme poverty, violence, and corruption depicted, and a brief mention of a hit-and-run incident involving 50 Cent.

A later segment featured loosely connected conversations.  It began with a discussion about a journalist filming in dangerous locations, followed by a bizarre "America's Got Genitals" segment featuring a penis-judging contest and commentary by Rich Voss.  Anthony Jeselnik's show was promoted.  A comedian guest then graphically detailed a recent sexual encounter with a mother he met on social media, providing explicit descriptions. The conversation expanded to include his dating life, previous relationships (including a detailed account of a three-way encounter with a missing condom and his ex-wife's openness to polyamory), his mother abandoning the family, and speculation about his mother's new partner's potentially cult-like behavior.  The hosts also engaged in joking, somewhat offensive commentary about racial stereotypes related to dating preferences.  The comedian concluded by promoting his special.

The show also featured a discussion about the website chill.com, a platform for passively aggressive content release, followed by anecdotes about Eddie Murphy and *48 Hours*, Liberia's infrastructure, and the misuse of rocket launchers.  A nostalgic discussion of beer commercials (Schaefer, Michelob, Coors Light, Wranglers, Grolsch) and cigarette commercials (Winston, Doral, Tarryton) ensued. A caller, Carl, complained about FiOS's commercial placement, leading to a discussion of Anthony's use of Twitter for customer service complaints and the challenges of maintaining positive relationships with fans, highlighting the negative aspects of online interactions for women close to the hosts.  The show concluded with a lengthy discussion of professional wrestling, focusing on Ted DiBiase, Virgil, and the “Lonely Virgil” website, detailing Virgil's current struggles and hustling tactics.

Finally, comedian Ari Shaffir guested on the show.  Shaffir discussed his "LonelyVirgil.net" website, his drone's capabilities and potential for misuse (including dropping objects and filming neighbors), and the legal implications of drone use.  The conversation shifted to Shaffir's dating life, including a recent encounter with a woman met on Twitter, leading to broader discussions about relationships, sex, and the differences between casual dating and marriage.  The segment ended with Shaffir promoting his shows and a transition to the "After ONA Live" segment featuring Sam Roberts, who discussed Opie's illness (allegedly from ingesting semen), and further conversations with other individuals.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Uh, is it this jizziness stuff?  Well, apparently it's Scott and...  What happens is they said that the more you keep drinking it, the longer you get sick. 
[00:05:00]  Oh!  It's hard to put down once you start.  Jesus Christ.  But we've all told them, like, dude, you gotta stop. I know it's delicious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh...  I've just been sitting here and thumbing through the newspaper and watching the news,  and, uh, I really just need to find new hobbies in life.  Um, everything I seem to enjoy, uh, is, uh, perhaps illegal. 
[00:05:30]  Um, everything from, um, uh, drones, fast cars, guns.  Sex.  Sex.  Wow, yeah, really.  Always kind of trying to skirt that...  Uh, yeah, the big story on all the news channels,  and, uh, and, uh, on the radio on the way in.  Their top of the, top of the hour news story.  Apparently somebody decided it was a good idea to, uh, 
[00:06:00]  a good idea to fly one of these, um, remotely piloted aircraft  close to one of the runways at JFK at 1,500 feet.  I don't know what the fuck anyone's thinking at that point.  Is that what that's about?  Yeah.  Yeah, some, uh, Air Italia, uh, mamma mia,  was coming into Kennedy, um, and reported, uh, a drone,  an unmanned vehicle, uh, in their line of sight. 
[00:06:30]  It landed without incident or anything,  but, uh, I guess Air Traffic Control put a, a little message out.  It was on the news.  I don't know.  It was pretty quick.  Maybe we could grab it somewhere.  I don't know.  It was on, um, CBS, and it was on, uh, on 1010 Winds.  But, uh, yeah, they had to put out a little alert  to other planes coming in that this pilot had spotted something  that was flying at, um, 1,500 feet, um, by one of the runways.  So then, you know, of course I get, 
[00:07:00]  Hey, Anthony, where were you yesterday?  Was that you?  Yeah.  So, uh, I mean, I just...  What would happen if that drone...  ...neezes are getting taken away?  If that was there, when that Alitalia plane was taken off  and it got a little close to the engine?  I would assume being able to, to get one of these things  in, in the, purposefully fly it into a moving air, 
[00:07:30]  jet aircraft's engine would be extremely difficult.  I gotta say.  If you left any kind of, like, with a path of where, you know,  the plane's taken off.  I would assume, still, it would be very difficult  for it to get sucked into an engine like a, a flock of birds  or something, you know, something like that.  It would probably be very difficult.  Not that it couldn't happen, but I would assume  it would be a lot more accidental  than somebody on purpose trying to fly it.  It would be like threading a needle.  But, I mean, there are, uh, certain scenarios 
[00:08:00]  with these things that could be very, very fucked up.  Uh, every, every year these things develop, uh,  more and more the ability to carry heavier payloads.  So, um, years ago, things like,  strapping explosives to radio-controlled aircraft  wasn't very viable because of the weight limitations,  uh, with a lot of these things.  The size was, uh, they'd have to be a lot bigger.  You'd have to be pretty proficient in flying these things. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, the, the limitation on how far they could fly  was also an issue.  Now, you're getting these, um, multi-rotor helicopters  that have the ability to, uh, go beyond your line of sight  using remote cameras to fly it  so you don't have to see it anymore.  That was a big thing.  You couldn't just take a helicopter up  and, and take it out of your line of sight  to fly it somewhere.  Now you could do that.  Heavier payloads, which I don't know what shenanigans 
[00:09:00]  a terrorist would want to use,  but, uh, C-4 does come to mind, things like that.  I mean, um, and being able to remotely pilot it,  uh, it's, it's, it is scary.  There's too much, especially, like, say,  the president's speaking somewhere  or any other public figure,  and you want to bring in,  there's just too much, too many bad things  you can do with it  or too many honest mistakes that could happen.  Yes.  There does seem to be something that, uh, is there,  that, um, that, uh, like, unlike guns 
[00:09:30]  are not protected by a Second Amendment right,  you might be able to skirt it  with a First Amendment issue of, um, you know,  because, um, of course, I use mine for photography.  Yes.  In my case, photography.  Uh, so me being a member of the media  and wanting access to certain things,  uh, I, I may be able to skirt that issue,  but I doubt that.  There will be regulations.  I, we've talked about this for over a year now, 
[00:10:00]  uh, and now it's kind of coming to the forefront here,  uh, on the news about them wanting to regulate these things.  And I just knew it.  I mean, it's, yeah.  I gotta, I gotta, if I get, E-Rock,  what Legos should I get?  I think I'm just gonna play with fucking Legos  in my house all day  because, eh, it seems like a safe thing  that the government won't want to regulate my Legos.  How about that?  I know, but then the ones you like,  they won't make, like, dude,  they're not making Auschwitz Legos. 
[00:10:30]  You think?  Yeah, the, we, we, we can't get real smoke  to come out of the stacks.  That's terrible.  Uh.  You know, all of your hobbies have potential  horrible effects on, on the people around you.  Yes.  But it's not me.  I'm responsible.  Yes.  For the most part.  Um, it's, but, but they are,  they are able to do dastardly things  is what it is.  I mean, uh,  somebody was flying it  by the fucking runway of Kennedy Airport. 
[00:11:00]  There is a radio control,  uh, model radio control field  right near Kennedy.  It's been there for years.  Uh, and, and people fly radio control airplanes  there and shit.  But, um, like I said, years ago,  you know, you take it up a couple of hundred feet  at most, you buzz it around within your line of sight,  you're not really going too far with these things.  Now, with the ability to go further and higher  and, and really know where you're taking it  without having to see it,  uh, that presents a new problem 
[00:11:30]  that the government is absolutely looking into.  Already some laws being looked at.  I think it was, uh, was it New Hampshire?  I don't know.  Shit.  Let's get those states confused.  Um, but they're saying they want a law  that says, uh,  you can't even fly these fucking things  and, and have a camera on it.  If the camera is looking at, uh, people,  any people,  or any man-made object.  So that includes everything in the world. 
[00:12:00]  Goings and planes.  Yeah.  So they don't want you flying this thing  and photographing anything  that is man-made or people.  That covers every loophole.  That creeps will try to use.  That's all that is.  Right.  Plus, you know,  they can also use it to,  to, for government building surveillance  for, for bad things,  not for healthy things.  There's just way too many shitty things.  Well, a lot of-  You can easily do.  That's what it is.  And a lot of people are saying, um,  a lot of people that use these things for business,  because there are people that photograph, um, 
[00:12:30]  people's property.  You know, people for some reason want  a photographic survey of their fucking property.  Sure.  They want, um,  to look at their building complex,  and, uh,  there, there are heat sensors  that you could put on these things  and take, um,  video of the roofs of buildings  to see if heat's escaping  and needs a new roof.  There are plenty of reasons  that people do use these for business.  Uh, you'll,  you're going to need some type of license  to actually have this for a business. 
[00:13:00]  That's already illegal.  I think some news agency  was using, um,  one of these unmanned vehicles  to video, um,  a gathering,  some kind of a protest or whatnot.  And they aired it on their station  and, uh,  got in trouble with the FAA  because it was commercial use of that.  Um, a lot of other people  that use it for commercial use  don't charge for the video of the drone.  They charge for the editing of the video. 
[00:13:30]  So it's a way around it.  They're not having people pay them  for actually flying the drone  and taking the video.  It's, well, later we'll,  we'll edit it  and we'll charge you for that.  So that's a way to get around that, uh,  that you're not allowed  to use it for business.  But they're really coming down.  And with incidents like this,  this is,  this is the drone equivalent of,  uh,  Janet Jackson,  of Janet Jackson,  of,  of maybe a gun in a school  but not being used yet.  But if something happens where, 
[00:14:00]  you know,  God forbid people are hurt,  uh,  because of these things,  that will be the equivalent  of a school shooting  where people die  and the people will come out  and say,  we,  we want these things banned  and there won't be a leg  to stand on.  There's no,  there's no second amendment.  There's no,  I need this for really.  Um,  but aerial photography  is a weird thing.  Unmanned aerial photography.  Okay,  you're not allowed to take,  uh,  video of people  or,  um,  structures  in that one law.  What about someone 
[00:14:30]  from a helicopter?  What about if you're  fucking taking video  out of an airplane window  when,  you know,  you're over a city  just,  just as somebody  on a plane?  People do that  all the time.  Google satellite pictures.  Google Earth,  Google satellite,  things like that  are coming up already  and people are saying,  wait a minute,  where does this fall  in the whole thing  of,  of banning,  uh,  this photography?  Well,  everyone doesn't have access to it.  I think that's the issue.  Uh-huh.  Even though that,  that's certainly a concern,  but it's not,  that's,  everyone can't go out 
[00:15:00]  and just get one.  That's another thing  I was thinking about also.  The fact that  they regulate these things,  it's not going to,  again,  stop people that want  to use them for,  uh,  bad things.  It's not going to stop them.  You know how those,  I'm sorry,  you know how they'll stop it  before I forget?  One of the things they'll do  is they'll go to Apple  and these other people  and they won't allow  the apps anymore  on their,  on their,  like,  you know,  they use them on the iPad.  That's one of the ways  you steer it,  right?  That's one for the little ones,  but for these big ones,  you use radio control units,  uh, 
[00:15:30]  and computers  and,  and,  and certain programs  that are available,  again,  out of the country.  A lot of this stuff  is bought from China.  A lot of the,  uh,  electronics,  the guidance electronics  and,  uh,  the actual copters  themselves.  People can order them,  you can put them together,  piecemeal,  that's not,  they can't ban  an actual  quad rotor aircraft.  Let's say that.  It's just a quad rotor,  you're flying it around  like a radio control helicopter.  Uh,  once you start putting  GPS 
[00:16:00]  and cameras on them  and sensors,  then it becomes  this drone issue,  this remotely piloted  or unmanned  pilot vehicle.  Uh,  that's where the problem  will come in  and people will be able  to just put these together,  you know,  and do,  uh,  what they want with it.  They're not going to  pay attention to the laws.  You know,  I'll be sitting there  with a fucking  great paperweight  in my house,  very expensive,  nice paperweight,  and,  uh,  people that want to do evil  will still do their evil  with it.  So,  I don't know where  this is going.  I hope your aerial  photography business  doesn't suffer. 
[00:16:30]  Oh,  me too.  I was looking forward  to all of your  foliage shots.  In my case,  it is photography.  That's why I,  um,  have this.  Of course.  But,  I don't know.  This is just,  I'm doing a show  for the Blaze,  um,  on Thursday.  Uh,  what the hell's it called?  I'll plug it later.  Game on and radio.  Yes,  that was it.  That was it.  It's an entire hour  on,  um,  on,  uh,  drones.  Civilian use of it.  Problems thereof. 
[00:17:00]  And,  uh,  boy.  It's a hard one to defend  because of the,  it's just it.  Guns are at least,  like,  a defense issue  in constitutional issues.  This is a rough one.  This is just why.  I,  because I like it.  Yeah.  Because it's fun.  Yeah.  I like it.  It's fun.  Why don't you get yourself  a G.I. Joe helicopter  and go out to the field  and just get it up there  50 feet  and just zoom around  and pretend to fight?  Yeah.  So I just go,  fuck,  fuck,  fuck,  fuck,  fuck,  fuck.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm doing a rescue mission,  guys.  Or one of those frisbee things  that you just throw  and then it spins around 
[00:17:30]  and comes right back to you.  Yeah.  Some medicine.  But,  but I like,  this is fun.  I know.  People also like landing safely.  Cameras on them  and,  you know,  all that fun stuff.  Technology.  Ooh.  When that thing takes off,  ring,  and you're controlling it?  Come on.  That is badass, dude.  It's fucking cool as shit.  But three years from now?  Oh,  don't forget about it.  It's going to,  this is going to happen  real fast  where they start banning  the shit out of these things.  First,  it'll be like around airports 
[00:18:00]  just so they can quickly  get something going.  And then they might sit down  and start thinking about  really how to  just completely outlaw  these fucking things.  Well,  apparently now the FAA  is investigating this case  and the  anti-terrorism task force  is looking into it.  I completely expect  it knocks on my door.  Is the one that you have  just like the one  they used in the airport?  Well,  they don't know exactly  what kind it was.  They said it was a black one.  They said they saw  like red lights on it. 
[00:18:30]  And,  yeah.  Do you know how fucking  close you have to be  to see the blinking lights  and see that  when you're on a plane  coming in?  I think they said  the pilot was about  150 feet away  from this thing.  Oh my God!  Yeah.  Yeah,  that's extremely close.  Very,  very close.  Yeah.  Somebody's reening it.  Wow.  Again,  it's probably a fucking  one of these,  it's probably the government 
[00:19:00]  doing it.  It's the government.  They don't want you  to have them.  So they obviously  put this false flag.  It's one of these things  where,  you know,  things happen like this  and they just  ban everything.  150 feet.  150 feet away.  To the left to right  that he said?  I really don't know.  It was definitely  in his sights though.  It says,  the pilot spotted  the unmanned craft  hovering 200 feet  from his jet  three miles east  of the airport.  Huh. 
[00:19:30]  200 feet.  He was flying  at about 1,800 feet.  So he was at 1,800 feet.  The other thing  was at 1,500 feet.  Looked like a black drone  about a meter square  with helicopter rotors  on the corners.  Sound familiar?  On the corners?  Well,  that might be a quad.  I have six rotors.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  They're banning  the shit out of your  I'd love to see  that guy's video.  Oh, man.  I wonder if he got  his camera on  pointing at the  fucking plane.  A pilot's eyes  open wide.  What the fuck?  Look as he goes by. 
[00:20:00]  He just see the guy  his face.  You could read his lips.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah, you see like  a whole row of people  just horrified looking out.  Bunch of fucking Italians.  And you're right about  it being so hard to defend  because the real reason,  I mean,  the real reason you have guns  is because they're fun  but they also serve a purpose  of defense and hunting  and all that.  Yeah, I like the fact  that I'm able to defend myself  with a gun.  Right, so at least  there's something besides  they're fun to have.  Right.  But with the drone things 
[00:20:30]  it's only...  I'm sunk.  I'm sunk on this one.  Aside, of course,  from your artistic side.  Well...  And press.  In my case, I do.  Journalistic.  Yes.  Yeah.  I am a journalist.  I do like a...  photographing things  and it gives you  a new angle.  And how are we going  to have our segment  on the show anymore  where you report  your findings in the sky?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  As a journalist.  This...  Uh-huh.  I wonder if they'll 
[00:21:00]  figure out who it was.  They'll probably question  people down at the flying field  close to the airport.  Because, I mean,  that's probably what it was.  Some guy got a little  overzealous  down at that field  and just started  flying his fucking drone  closer to the airport.  Well, three miles away  they said it was.  So he may have...  He may have been in the field  and just went higher  than you should.  And thought...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then meanwhile  it's right in the flight path  of a plane  instead of, you know,  to the side or...  Uh...  It's just, uh... 
[00:21:30]  It really is just a problem.  They're...  They're going to...  They're going to access.  They kind of have to.  I know.  They kind of have to.  I don't even know what to like.  Like, I've been just toiling  trying to come up  with an excuse.  I've been trying  so hard  to be able to, like,  passionately defend  these things.  It's got to be something  to be outraged.  We need...  Fuck, I can't figure out  why we need them.  Because they're cool.  They're fun.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, okay.  Do you want the... 
[00:22:00]  Only the government  to have drones?  Man!  How about that?  Excellent.  Excellent argument.  Yeah.  People will be like,  no, we don't.  We want to have them  too.  Yeah.  And you're the man  who should have one.  Exactly!  Correctamundo!  Yeah, there's no defense.  No.  And we talked about this  and just knew  this was coming  before anybody, like,  really said anything.  But, boy,  once the news  hits like this  and now lawmakers  are going to start  talking about it.  It's such a new thing, though. 
[00:22:30]  And, obviously,  the terrorism aspects  of these  are unbelievable.  Sure.  Like you said,  if there's a public figure  speaking  outdoors somewhere,  which they do often,  there's nothing  keeping somebody  from flying that  right into somebody.  Or putting a remote  control gun on it.  Like, maybe they can't  do it at this moment,  but with the way...  Like, you can put a gun  on that,  and then how does  the Secret Service  protect somebody  from that? 
[00:23:00]  Like, you can protect  from a lot of things  and from people,  but how the fuck  do you protect  from the entire...  There's a video online  of a multi-rotor  helicopter,  and someone put  a paintball gun on it  and flew it around  these wooden silhouettes  of people  and was just tagging them.  Pop, pop, pop, pop.  How'd they get...  How'd they remote  fire the...  With a...  All you need is a servo  and a switch on your remote.  It's easy.  What's a servo?  It's actually easy.  It's a little motor  actuator that moves  a little lever.  It goes pop, pop, pop, pop,  and just fucking 
[00:23:30]  pulls the trigger.  And, uh...  Wow.  Which one is that?  Helicopter with paintball gun.  No, I think they're  shooting the helicopter  with a paintball gun.  I don't think the paintball gun's  on the helicopter, is it?  Yeah.  See, the thing is  that people don't even...  I don't think the average person  realizes the kind of technology  that's available.  No, they don't.  So now the news  can just have a field day  and everybody's  going to get freaked out.  That's what it is.  Everyone's going to get freaked out.  They were talking about  the drone on Fox,  about this drone,  which is, you know,  really a model aircraft 
[00:24:00]  with a lot of technology on it.  But they were showing  a Predator drone  on the screen.  Well, drone is a scary word.  So you're assuming  that there's this  Predator drone  someone's flying around  near the airport.  Ah, what the hell's going on?  Everybody's got their own  helicopters?  Ah, what do I need?  You just give me a helmet  so nothing falls on my head.  That's all I need.  You go ahead.  You go fly yourself  to the crazy house.  The crazy house.  That ain't it either.  Yeah, but this is...  Has somebody put a paintball  on that?  Yeah, this is a paintball gun.  Paintball gun? 
[00:24:30]  Shooting, you can see  the pink spots on it.  On a little helicopter?  It's not hovering that far  above the plastic  five feet off the ground.  That's a regular helicopter  and RC.  Great footage.  And they're shooting,  I guess, a truck with it.  But I mean, really,  if you have that,  that's the idea.  You could have some type  of explosive device,  obviously laden  with fucking nails  and things like that  and just have it explode.  Or felt hats.  Oh, felt hats  would hurt people.  Or lower a goofy hat 
[00:25:00]  on someone's head  and make them look silly.  Yeah.  And then there's a picture taken  and now they're stuck  with that their whole life.  Right, a big yellow hat.  Oh, nerds.  And then it flies off  at the evidence.  And then he tweets it  and you're just stuck  because the internet's forever.  And then you try  to run for office  and you've got a big  dumb hat on your head.  Don't vote for Bill Dudley.  Look at him wearing  a cunt hat here  in Schenectady.  I mean, obviously  the opportunity  for evil  is unbelievable.  We talked a while ago 
[00:25:30]  about the possibility  of just dropping shit  into a prison yard.  There's no roofs  on those things.  You just fly it over  and drop some tools  of chicanery in there.  Watch him have some fun.  Heat sensors.  Once the heat sensor,  that's how you fly it  into a plane.  If there's a heat sensor on it,  you could direct it  right up to it.  You wouldn't even have to.  You could probably  tie it into the autopilot.  I mean, there's an autopilot  on there that guides it  back home.  It guides it to  various waypoints  that you want it to go to 
[00:26:00]  without even having  to touch a remote control.  You hit send  on your fucking computer  and it will go  wherever you wanted it to go.  You guys are coming up  with a great list  of reasons  why they should be  banning these.  Believe me,  this is absolutely  everything  they will come up  with anyway.  I'm just saying.  The possibilities  for evil  are astounding.  It's so much easier.  Their argument  is so much easier  than yours.  That I want to  photograph things?  Yes.  That I like the idea  of being able  to take pictures 
[00:26:30]  from a few hundred feet  in the air  and then watch them  on my computer  and go,  look, cool.  Yeah.  That's my argument.  And arguments against?  Yeah,  the blowing up  of aircraft  and people  and placing  ugly hats  on important people's heads.  Yeah.  They're going to  start coming up  with these scenarios.  I'm really surprised  though that  some evil people  haven't already  come up with  these things  and used them. 
[00:27:00]  It might be just  too new.  It's one of those things  that's getting better  and it might not be  a hundred percent.  Well,  yeah,  it's not a hundred percent  but I mean  it's probably easier  than a lot of shit  they've tried in the past.  They don't even have to  like a terrorist  organization  wouldn't even have  to be successful  with one of these things.  All they'd have to do  is use one.  Could you see something  detonating  near a plane  where the pilots  are like  something exploded  near my plane  and then  they figure out  that it was 
[00:27:30]  some radio-controlled  device?  The terror,  again,  it's terrorism.  Terror is the word.  People would be  afraid to fly again.  They'd be worried  shitless.  The news would be  all over it.  We'd be changing  our lifestyles again.  That right there  would be enough  to really get people going.  I'm really surprised  unless they're planning  right now  going,  oh no,  I listen to  Obi and Anthony  every morning  and now they are  on to us.  What's the first time  they fly one over  onto the White House lawn?  Right. 
[00:28:00]  I mean,  it's not that difficult.  I mean,  I'm sure that their  security there  is pretty good.  How good could  your security be  with a device  that's one meter  wide?  Right.  I mean,  you just think  about things like,  you know,  eh,  he comes out.  You know,  they don't have  a protection  against things like this.  No.  It's crazy.  He'll have to start  talking or walking  in a bubble  all the time,  like some kind  of a bubble.  Oh my god,  like a Pope mobile  almost,  yeah,  but when you walk,  where you walk  like a Segway 
[00:28:30]  with a bubble on it.  Just the president  rolling on a Segway  with a big bubble  on it.  Stalking,  stalking your ex,  even shit like that  that's not public figures.  Right.  The way these fucking guys  want to spy on their ex-wives  and then kill them.  Just taking video  of where they've been.  The paparazzi,  they've been looking  into this.  For filming things,  I think these have been  seen over sets,  Hollywood sets,  to video people  that are making movies.  There's the celebrities, 
[00:29:00]  what's this movie about?  I mean,  they're being used  already to kind of  peek into places  you're not normally  able to peek into.  High-profile weddings.  Yeah,  those things where  normally you'd need  a helicopter,  you'd need to,  and meanwhile,  usually they get  the FAA  to ban air traffic  over a certain area  when there's  a big wedding.  They're able to do that.  They say,  and it's under the guise  that it's a danger  that so many helicopters  are going to be in one area  and they don't want that,  so they say,  okay,  when's this happening? 
[00:29:30]  We'll restrict the airspace  for these giant  celebrity weddings.  Meanwhile,  this thing,  you're fucking,  you know,  a half a mile away  in the woods.  You fly this thing over,  you could get,  you could get that thing down  fucking within,  within jumping,  slapping 12 feet  where someone's just  out of someone's reach  and you're,  you've got a camera  in their face.  Yeah,  and all of a sudden  you're taking pictures  of every Tom,  Dick,  and Harry.  Who the hell needs it?  Give me a container of coffee.  You're crazy.  You just need your container  of coffee.  Give me a Polaroid.  You like your Polaroid cameras? 
[00:30:00]  Oh yeah,  take a look at us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just too many problems.  Too many problems.  Too many problems.  But,  again,  I can't believe  more people  haven't used these things.  Because they're going to get  smaller too.  Smaller.  Bombs and terrorism,  but just for the spying aspect,  wait,  oh,  did you see the footage  of the,  I think it was,  I want to say  Gary Kasparov,  the chess player,  where he was doing  a press conference in Russia 
[00:30:30]  and somebody flew their dick,  oh,  you saw that?  But flew a remote control  dick helicopter.  It was a big rubber dick  with rotors  and it flew in  and it was just above  the people's heads.  Yeah,  there it is.  And they're trying  to slap at it,  but it was too high  and then finally  some big bruiser  got a hold of it,  took it down.  Slapped it down.  But somebody flew  a RC penis.  It says flying  RC penis attack.  And arguably  the greatest chess player  to ever live  is trying to talk  and a big cock  has been floored  at him. 
[00:31:00]  Oh,  is that hilarious?  And people were  kind of laughing.  Because it's a dick  flying around the room.  Taking pictures of it  and the one guy  smacks it.  Smacks it  across the room.  True cock block.  Yeah.  Oh man,  that's fucking funny.  You see people  laughing too.  How could you  not laugh  at a flying dick?  Everyone's laughing.  Flying dicks are  hard.  Yeah,  so I think  we're pretty much  on the road 
[00:31:30]  to these things  being banned.  Completely banned.  I just wonder  what they're going  to do with regular  recreational radio  control aircraft.  Because that's  something that's  been a hobby  for years and years.  But those two  can now  with the newer  technology,  do you ban  the GPS  and the autopilots  from them?  Maybe how high  they can go.  Yeah.  How is that  going to stop  anybody that wants  to do it?  I mean,  that's going to  maybe prevent 
[00:32:00]  some accidental  RC control laws  thing happen.  RC control laws.  But a lot of  people,  you know,  they have,  this is their  little hobby.  What are you  going to do?  But as the  technology improves,  you need new laws  for it.  I'm trying to think  if there was some  kind of,  I don't know,  ban on something  else that was  okay,  and then it just  became too  technologically advanced 
[00:32:30]  and they had to  say,  get rid of that  shit.  There's just,  there's no way  to spin it  because there's  such a new  technology,  there's nothing  that,  and there's no,  the,  the,  the public,  the danger to  the public  outweighs  people's right  to hobby.  Like,  it just,  it's too much  of a common  sense,  there's too much  of a fucking  danger.  Believe me,  I'd love to,  you'd think the  first thing I  thought of is  how much great  jerk-off footage  I could get  window to  window to  window to  window.  I live in a  40-story  building. 
[00:33:00]  A lot of  potential there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just,  like,  I was into  radio control  helicopters,  like,  over 10 years  ago,  and there  wasn't this  technology  available just  yet to  really,  to really  pinpoint these  things,  to really put  them where you  want to put  them,  and it was  mostly just  a flying hobby  instead of  photography.  Why don't you  get yourself  some trains,  like fucking  Bobby Bacala.  Yeah,  like Bobby Bacala, 
[00:33:30]  I'll just have  trains.  Yeah,  wear a little  conductor's hat  and go by  the blue  comet,  do us all  a favor.  I don't know.  It's fucking,  I don't know,  because that is  something people  are really,  like,  passionate about,  RC airplane  modeling,  things like that.  What about model  rocketry?  I mean,  is that at a  point?  I don't even know  what the technology  is there at this  point.  I don't know  what the  restrictions are,  but that seems  like something 
[00:34:00]  that could get  a little dangerous  if they start  putting any kind  of guidance  on them.  Are you allowed  to put guidance  fins on those  things and send  them places?  I mean,  that's the old  Estes model rockets.  I used to play  with those as a  kid.  I was quite the  little geek.  Quite the little  whiny,  crying geek as a  kid.  Loved that shit.  I'm checking the  National Association  of Rocketry's  website to see if  there's any  restrictions.  How'd you get  on it?  The traffic  must be crazy  on that thing.  Wow.  There is a 
[00:34:30]  model rocket  safety code.  What is that?  I don't know.  Let's see.  I bet you're  not allowed to...  This is more  of like a pledge.  Is it?  Ew.  I'm going to  take the model  rocketry safety  code pledge.  Should we take  it and make  sure that we're...  Oh.  I shall not  squat over the  rocket nude and  fire it up my  ass with a  D-  engine.  I will use  a countdown  before launch.  Oh, that's so  geeky, by the way.  I never did that  as a kid. 
[00:35:00]  You're supposed  to take the  little alligator  clips and put it  on the igniter and  then unroll the  wire a few feet  away and then  you're supposed  to like,  clear!  Okay!  Ten!  Nine!  I just went  like, send it  up.  That's okay.  You didn't have  to do this  because this  safety code was  only effective  August 2012.  Oh, what's  the new  safety code?  Let's hear  the safety code.  Oh, it is  the new  safety code.  Okay.  Safety is  important.  I will use  only lightweight  non-metal parts  for the nose,  body, and 
[00:35:30]  fins of my  rocket.  All right.  A lot of  plastic and  balsa wood  they use, I  know.  It kind of  goes that  sound.  I hear you.  I will use  only certified  commercially  made rocket  motors and  will not  tamper with  these motors  or use them  for any  purposes except  those recommended  by the  manufacturer.  All right.  I kind of  broke that  law once.  I had an  SD's model  rocket and  I had a  stage  photographic  flash powder,  big fucking  can of it,  and I  unloaded it,  I poured it  into the  model rocket  and glued the  nose cone on 
[00:36:00]  and then sent  it up and  I assumed it  would go up  and then the  parachute  ejection charge  it's called,  when the motor  burns out,  the top of the  motor actually  goes,  explodes,  and the  pressure from  that pops  the nose cone  off and  deploys the  parachute and  the whole thing  comes down  real nice.  You know?  But that  parachute charge  is hot so  you put  wadding between  the motor and  the parachute so  the parachute  don't melt.  So I didn't  have any  wadding and I  figured that  heat from  that would  ignite the 
[00:36:30]  flash powder  and it  would blow  up and  it would  look cool.  It would  blow up  in the air.  So I  send it  up,  goes up,  and then  it arcs  and starts  coming down  and I'm  like,  oh shit,  it's not  blowing up.  And it  hit my  neighbor's  roof and  exploded.  And it  blew about  five shingles  off of his  roof.  And I ran  inside.  How old  were you?  Probably  27.  I thought he  was like  four.  No.  No,  me and 
[00:37:00]  my friends  were having  fun.  Oh my  God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We ran  inside the  house laughing  and then  hid from the  landlord because  I couldn't  afford the  rent because  I was  buying model  rockets.  What a  piece of  shit.  No,  you're  fucking  just  Pete  priorities  wrong.  Oh,  fuck  yeah.  All over  the place.  You have  such potential  to do  terrible  things too.  But you're  just a  good citizen.  I try.  It's good  for people  that you're 
[00:37:30]  not a  fucking  terrorist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But other  rules.  Let's see if I  broke any  other rules.  Well,  we already  know that  you broke  the countdown  rule.  Yeah.  I will  ensure that  everyone is  paying attention  and is a  safe distance  of at least  15 feet  away when I  launch rockets  with D  motors or  smaller.  No.  And 30  feet when I  launch larger  rockets.  No.  No?  Okay.  I will  launch my  rocket from  a launch  rod,  tower,  or rail  that is  pointed to  within 30  degrees of  the vertical  to ensure 
[00:38:00]  that the  rocket flies  nearly straight  up.  Oh,  no,  I've leaned  that fucker  over real  far to see  how far it  could go.  Yeah,  you're supposed  to launch  them straight  up,  but if you  pull that  thing down  and fire it  at an angle,  it gets some  good distance.  Yeah,  then it becomes  a missile.  I will not  launch my  rocket at  targets,  into clouds,  or near  airplanes,  and will not  put any  flammable  or explosive  payload in  my rocket.  All right.  That could be  a problem.  I'm breaking  the model  rocketry safety  code.  They would  kick you out  of the  National Association 
[00:38:30]  of Rocketry.  Yes.  NAR.  They would  make you  go out  and get  a girl.  I will  not attempt  to recover  my rocket  from power  lines,  tall trees,  or other  dangerous  places.  Yeah,  I didn't  do that.  Those are  pretty much  all those.  Although I  did climb  up the  telephone pole  with a  ladder and  fiddled  with wires  to get  free cable.  But that  doesn't,  you know.  How old  were you?  29.  Your late  20s were  awesome.  They were  awesome.  And I  was broke. 
[00:39:00]  And they  were still  awesome.  You ever  see those  balloons,  the footage  where they  send a  balloon up  and it  actually goes  to the  edge of  the atmosphere?  It spins.  They can't  control the  spinning.  Yeah.  But that  even,  you can be  dangerous just  with a  fucking  balloon in  a basket  with a  little camera  on it  if you  want to  be.  You know  what I  realize?  You could  probably  set off  a couple  of those  rockets from  one of  those remote  helicopters.  Set off  the rockets,  have it  filled with  something,  and just  oh man, 
[00:39:30]  that would  look cool  as hell,  but I  bet that's  illegal.  Yeah,  I don't  think that's  part of the  National Association  of Rocketry.  I'm not even  talking the  Rocketry Safety  Code.  I'm talking  the fucking  law,  Homeland Security.  You think the  FAA quoted  the Rocketry  Safety Law?  That's how  they base  the law  on the  Rocketry  Safety  Code.  You're not  to use  more than  a 30  degree angle  when launching.  Oh shit,  I've done  that. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah,  we're sunk.  I used to  love those  things though.  When I  lived in  California,  I used to  catch lizards.  Those things  are all over  the place  out there.  I'd catch  lizards and  make them  the little  lizard  astronauts.  And I  put them  in the  payload  section of  the rocket.  Yeah,  yeah.  I wasn't  crashing them  in there.  That's nice.  You were just  sending them  into the air.  There was a  separate payload  section that's  separate from the  actual body tube  where the  parachute is.  So you'd  unscrew that and a lot  of times it was  clear plastic so you'd 
[00:40:30]  put them in there,  pop the nose cone on  that and you'd see  the little fucking  lizard.  They were like those  five inch lizards?  Yeah,  the little ones that  are all over out  west.  Can you imagine  it would shoot up  like crazy?  How fucking crazy  that would be for a  lizard to experience  that?  With his stupid  little lizard brain  like, what's  happening here?  Oh, how many  G's he must have?  Lizards, I'm sure  lizards aren't used  to pulling a lot  of G's.  Little lizards don't  do things where  they're pulling  fucking, his little  face is going  back. 
[00:41:00]  Rock, water,  grass, dirt,  rock, water,  grass, dirt,  repeat.  Then all of a  sudden, big greasy  Italian hand, glass  all over,  everything's going  quickly, what  happened?  Were they dying  or no?  No, they were  fine.  I'd let them go.  I liked lizards as  a kid.  They're humanitarian.  My little pals.  Well, I must,  there were a couple  of instances where  due to some type  of anomaly, the  rocket would crash  and I have lost a  few lizard astronauts 
[00:41:30]  in the tragedy.  Yeah, it happens.  But it's part of  scientific exploration,  isn't it?  Yeah.  Casualties happen.  One time the  rocket...  Sacrifices must be  made.  Yeah.  For the common  good.  One time the  nose cone was a  little loose on  the payload section  and the rocket  went up with the  lizard in it and  the little nose cone  pops off and the  payload section all  in one piece and  then the parachute  comes out and I 
[00:42:00]  guess the jolt from  the parachute  catching kind of  pulled the nose  cone off and the  payload section  opened with the  bottom open so he  fell out of the  payload section  and just plummeted  about 200 feet.  I was not able to  recover him.  He was unrecoverable.  It was a tragedy.  M.I.A.  It was.  But you know what?  He was a hero.  He never...  Yes.  He touched the face  of God.  I gave a little 
[00:42:30]  speech.  He slipped the  surly bonds of  earth to touch the  face of God.  Yes.  Was that the last  time you cried?  No.  I didn't even cry  over my dead lizard.  Before that lizard  met you, its whole  life was just being  stuck to the ground  and then within  minutes he was  falling from the sky.  There would have  been no way he  would have done that  just through his  normal course of  lizard life.  He might have  toppled off a rock  and rolled a little  down the riverbed 
[00:43:00]  embankment or  something.  That was biblical  shit to him.  Oh my God.  Right?  Think about that.  A human walking  around.  He's grabbed up  by something,  shoved in a rocket.  You did give him  a once in a lifetime  experience.  Literally.  Because that was  it for him.  You're like the  Richard Branson of  lizard world.  Yeah.  I did feel bad  about that one.  I didn't cry  or anything but  I felt bad.  I wonder why.  I was always  pissy eyed about  everything else. 
[00:43:30]  Then you kill a  living thing because  you want to play  with your rockets.  I did cry over  a lizard once.  I was trying to  catch one all day  when I first went  out to California.  I think I was  probably 11 years  old and it was a  summer trip to go  visit dad and we  were in Laguna  Beach and walking  into the apartment  this like right when  we got picked up  from the airport and  and my dad drives  happy to see his  boys again and  fucking I think  he might have  forgotten for a  split second what a  faggot his younger 
[00:44:00]  boy was and I saw  a lizard and I'm  like oh lizard and  I went to catch it  and I grabbed him  and grabbed his tail  and his tail of  course breaks off.  They have that  defense mechanism  where their lizard  tails break off and  they regrow a new  one and you're left  holding a wiggling  lizard tail and  that's supposed to  distract the predator  that got the lizard  and the lizard has  time to get away.  Is that why it  still wiggles?  Yeah yeah and the  little bird or  something will be  like oh it got me  a fucking lizard and  it's like oh by the 
[00:44:30]  time he realizes you  know the lizard is  like fuck you all  growing a new tail  and I'm left there  holding this wiggly  lizard tail as the  lizard runs away and  what do I do?  What does little  fucking Anthony do?  Hey you're the lizard!  I'm 11 crying over a  lizard holding the tail.  trip with your  father.  My dad was just  like alright this has  to end.  He knew.  He knew.  He was disgusted.  At that point.  Oh shut up because  they're all over out 
[00:45:00]  here.  You'll get a lizard.  But I had him and  he did.  Ugh.  Did you get one?  What a disgrace.  Yeah I finally got one  later.  I got pretty proficient  at catching him right  behind the neck.  You creep up on him  kind of from behind  and then you get  him and grab him by  the back of the neck  and the shoulders.  How do they break  their tails off?  They just have like a  it's like a spot.  If you look at a lizard's  tail you can see where  it happens.  Like their scales and  there's like a little  different looking ripple  in one of the scales and 
[00:45:30]  that's where it just  breaks off.  They know.  They fucking figure out  how to just break their  tail off.  But do they have to  pull away from it or  they can just  voluntarily?  No they kind of pull  away.  Yeah it goes like  it's real disgusting.  But they can just  grow a new one.  Yeah and then it like  scabs up and then  after a while they just  grow a new tail.  Can you imagine if  your fucking arm did  that and then your leg  just to distract the  murderer?  Genetically they've been  looking at trying to  figure out how to do  that with some kind of  you know using that  genetics of lizards to 
[00:46:00]  try to figure out how  you could grow your  fucking arm back.  Wouldn't that be sick?  It would just like  oh I lost my arm but  yeah it'll be back in  like three months.  Especially if it was a  lizard tail they fucked  up the technology and  you're just lizard tail  boy and nobody wants to  talk to you.  Tail arm.  Like an asshole.  That would be stupid.  Yeah it was so  embarrassing.  It was a little lizard  walking around with a  big arm off his ass.  Things got mixed up.  The new version of the  fly.  Yeah you'd have two  like your gloves  wouldn't be right.  You'd have one lizard  glove.  Looks like a silly  goose. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah I wound up  getting more lizards but  I found many other  things to weep about  openly.  My horse is being  stupid.  I don't like this  saddle.  This saddle's stupid.  I want the other  one.  You cried about the  saddle?  I was always crying  about everything.  Were a lot of  things stupid?  Everything was  stupid.  That's stupid.  I don't want to  feed the horses.  Stop crying.  What's the matter 
[00:47:00]  with me?  Boy did you.  Oh.  That fucking  the war games door  was shut on your  tears.  close down the  mountain.  Yeah.  Norad.  The big Norad  vault.  Yeah that's where  all the humanity in  you is.  It's in some little  fucking you know  just unplug the  goddamn thing.  Emotionally the  whopper.  Yes.  Terrible.  Oh shit.  All right. 
[00:47:30]  Why don't we take a  little break huh?  Our food is here.  Yummy.  And oh just  plenty of stuff  apparently the big  news last night  Ted DiBiase  coming out on  Raw and fans  were chanting  we want Virgil.  I think that's  this could be some  kind of a Vince  work with this  Virgil thing.  He better take  advantage of it.  Yeah.  Miss Teen  Delaware giving  her name on camera  I guess.  Filming a disclaimer.  They release the  because they always  make these porno  stars not only  sign a release  but talk into the 
[00:48:00]  video.  So it's not a  forgery.  You know what?  I bet that's hot  to just listen to.  I want to hear  that.  I found her very  attractive that  girl.  God damn.  The company sure  didn't.  They could have  done more with  her and they  didn't.  She offered and  they said she  was too frigid  and they never  shot with her  again.  Too frigid?  Did you watch  the video?  She was okay.  Busted white  trash chick.  I love it.  But imagine how  much they'd make  with all these  Miss Teen  Delaware.  They're kicking  themselves. 
[00:48:30]  She didn't.  She wasn't  really like  very you know  but I'm sure  you know she  was probably  give her a few  more tries.  I bet she'd be  a little better.  But um.  They offered her  a lot of money  to be a  spokesperson for  this or a  spokesperson.  Yeah.  250 large.  Yeah.  Something like  that.  Wow.  Just to be the  spokesperson.  I thought she  was very pretty.  Yeah.  And she'll do  it.  She had that  girl next door  face and then  she's there  getting fucking  plowed from  behind from  some big dick  motherfucker.  What is she 
[00:49:00]  going to do  now though?  What do you  have to miss  Teen Delaware?  You can't  enter any more  of those.  That door is  closed.  So where do  you go?  She's also  a warrant out  for her arrest  in Maryland.  She has a warrant  out for her arrest  in Maryland.  What happened?  Underage possession  of alcohol and  theft charges.  She's a party  girl.  She allegedly  stole money  from a city  bus fare box.  She is fucking  great.  She needs money.  She's a fucking  like.  She is white  trash.  A pretty  white trash 
[00:49:30]  that's all  busted up.  Would you  bring her  up to the  compound?  She would  fucking get  royalty treatment.  What are you  kidding?  She's wonderful.  Perfect.  That to me  you know what I  call that?  Girlfriend  material.  I've made  mistakes my  whole life like  that.  Yeah why  wouldn't you  want a fucking  18 year old  thief who  does porn?  How could  that go wrong?  Perfect.  She is  fantastic.  I am  despicable.  If she just  wanted her ass  eaten in the 
[00:50:00]  jacuzzi.  Oh would that  be great right?  Yes.  And she's  like if you're  fucking her  she's like don't  even think of  pulling out.  Perfect right?  Let me just  milk your dick.  Oh God.  That's just me  saying that.  Oh look at  that.  Just imagine  what her father  must think.  Oh she's  probably cranking  it to the  video.  Looking at  her all those  years growing  up.  There's my  little girl.  My little  beauty contestant.  Oh my little  beauty contestant. 
[00:50:30]  Probably very  proud that she  was you know  Miss Delaware.  And then.  Aim for pageant  school and  lessons.  You think the  parents watched  the video?  Was it like  that scene in  fucking hardcore  with George C.  Scott?  Yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  He's watching  his little girl  fucking do  horrible things.  Must be  like that.  How you guys  with daughters  do it is  beyond me.  You're going  to hope for  the lesbian  thing Trav?  I'd be fine  with that.  Are you going  to go for  that? 
[00:51:00]  Instead of  the fucking  instead of  the Kardashian  route?  Where they  just can't  get enough  black dick?  What is  now the  young one  is going  out with  fucking  Jaden  Smith with  Will Smith's  kid?  He's barely  black.  Come on  this celebrity  thing it  doesn't matter.  Kanye.  Jaden  Smith.  I mean  these are  like.  What?  These are  the equivalent  of rockers  in the  70s.  That's  the taboo  that the  black guys  are naughty.  Like oh  these guys  are I'm  telling you  these are  fucking  rich kids.  Kardashians love 
[00:51:30]  black con.  What do they do?  It's amazing.  Kanye's a  fucking  brat.  He's just a  fucking  brat.  I can't  even enjoy  his music  sometimes.  He makes  it difficult.  He's such  a cunt  this guy.  You don't  like him?  No and  it's unfortunate  because he's  just such a  he snivels  about not  winning awards.  The tail is  so he's  just a  fucking  whiny little  baby.  Do you  have a  picture  with him?  I have  not met  him.  I saw  him once.  Would you  take a  picture  with him?  I  sure  would.  I love  that.  Jimmy's  like what  a sniveling  eye kiss. 
[00:52:00]  Oh please  picture.  I saw  him in  years ago  eat with  my  girlfriend  in L.A.  and I  saw him  in a  restaurant  where a  lot of  celebrities  eat.  They ate  off lunch  there.  Yeah but  I didn't  recognize him  she did  and he  was on  his way  out.  Fuck  him.  Fuck  him.  Did you  want to  watch the  video of  her consenting  to wrap  up the  story or  do you  want to  do it  after the  break?  Do you  even care?  No we'll  do it  after the  break.  Let's  eat.

[01:01:30]  for days  this motherfucker  I would have  to be  twiddling my  nipples to  keep my  erection  he doesn't  oh and  then she's  just looking  at the camera  like just  fuck me  from behind  where's her  feet  that's great  look at her  her fingers  too she's got  very long  slender fingers  she's great  oh I've  looked at  every inch  of this video  have you  spanked to it  no not yet  I might  there's those  big tootsies  look at that  right  big long  suckable tootsies  great  and the little  like the  the little  pad behind  her toes  and on her  heel is a  little darker 
[01:02:00]  from the  carpet  she's been  walking around  barefoot  they're actually  weirdly shaped  they're actually  long  they don't have  much shape  to them  they're like  long  they're like  fucking  flipper feet  like great  to swim feet  look how she's  arching her  back to take  that cock  yeah  she like does  that back arch  thing  a little bigger  than she's used  to  maybe right  she's used to  some fucking  high school  guys  what the fuck  is that about  yeah  god damn it  oh son of a  bitch  and then fucking  mr harry calves  mcgillicuddy is  just giving her  a fucking  she's riding him

[01:03:00]  that's even  hotter though  i don't need  this  no no no  meaning it's real  though i don't  need to hear a  fake  i don't want to  hear fake  but i want to  hear a whimper  i don't want to  hear i want a  whimper  she's probably  just too nervous  you think  yeah  oh my god  i like that  sound though of  fucking more than  dumb music  and fake groaning  oh look at that  oh look at her  sucking dick ready  for some cum  oh what a good egg  god  can't believe we're  just going through  this entire video  again  dude look at her  she's holding the 
[01:03:30]  penis like please  be over soon  please be over soon  she's like well  i'm probably at  the one thousand  four hundred ninety  five dollar mark  almost there  kneeling on a pillow  that's how real  girls suck your  dick that's  great  yeah  that's fucking  great  tentative  look at that  she's just  trying to  slicking the  balls to give  herself a break  look at her  fucking abs  oh here we go  he can't  this guy doesn't  even have a good  fucking load  he's got his hand  on her neck  because he's angry  at women  no he has a  terrible load  what a fucking 
[01:04:00]  awful load that  is and the face  she makes  it's the face  you should make  when you're  taking cum  blech  he gave her  one little  fucking dot  on the fucking  under her eye  like fucking  what's his name  from the Waltons  he gave her  the uh  john boy  the john boy  would you kiss  her right there  would you make  out with her  for a minute  right there  and if you did  you could have  her as your  girlfriend  no  I couldn't  if the cum  was on her  face but not  her lips  no  oh I gotta  kiss her lips  with cum  on her face  yeah  and then you  might get some 
[01:04:30]  on your cheek  or something  no  but  I don't want  that guy's  cum near me  why not  because I'm  like a  fucking  heterosexual  male  so what  I mean  you can  have her  after  oh  that's a  tough call  right  oh god  I thought  she was  great in  that movie  like that  was  even though  I would  rather hear  her talk  a little  bit  that was  real life  I hate  when they  fake moan  it drives  me nuts  it's terrible  over the top  yeah stop it  I would like  a whimper 
[01:05:00]  something  when you're  looking at  those large  feet  going back  and forth  like that  that would  be good  her fucking  little  goddamn  her fucking  skis  Reese's  monkey's  feet  she's got  her skis  she's got  fucking  otter feet  giant  fucking  really  old swim  fin feet  but she  was really  attractive  man  yes  like  the way  she sucks  dick  because he's  holding her  hair  and she's  holding the  dick  with both  hands  but kind 
[01:05:30]  of like  like a tentative  almost like a  bird peck  oh boy  that's how a real  girl gives your  head man  that's so hot  do you think  the fathers of  every other  contestant  just watched  that  and was like  fuck I can't  believe I'm  gonna see this  chick  fucking  getting fucked  oh god  yeah man  oh my god  they gotta go to  those dumb  pageants  and look at  these girls  and their dumb  fucking outfits  and it finally  pays off  yeah  especially a guy  that was probably  like wow  that girl's  attractive  and then wait  that's the one  or the one guy  in high school  who could have 
[01:06:00]  dated her  but didn't  because she was  like a little  annoying  and he had  another kind  of hot  girlfriend  oh boy  well I can't  see who  would date  Miss Delaware  she was a  party girl  I bet  you could tell  that underage  drinking shit  that rap  fucking stealing  money from a bus  yeah anyone who  steals money  from a bus  is fun  she is total  fucking trash  do you follow  her on twitter  is she on twitter  I do  yeah  she did something  like you know  which is probably  something you shouldn't  fucking tweet  after something like  this she's like  and god wouldn't 
[01:06:30]  give me anything  too big  god doesn't give you  anything too big  to handle  it's like really  too big to handle  you're gonna write  that with that  giant cock  going in and out  of you  what's her name  her name is  melissa king  it's melissa  underscore m  underscore king  that's an easy  one to remember  get her to  follow me  people  yeah  she'll follow  me  that'll be  fun  she only has  7,000 followers  because I was  keeping her to  myself for a  while  now it's gonna  fucking go  crazy 
[01:07:00]  she's tweeting  what did she  tweet  she's retweeting  support from  people that are  like you know  girl everyone  makes mistakes  you're beautiful  there's two  types of people  people are always  gonna throw stones  just learn to  catch and build  with them  yeah  who the fuck  says that  all right  that was me  that would be  hilarious  Anthony Cumia  no  there's uh  here's the type  of people that  are tweeting  her  there's girls 
[01:07:30]  that are just  calling her a  complete slut  there's guys  that are calling  her a complete  slut  that wanna fuck  her  then there's  the girls  that are very  supportive  you know  we make  mistakes  you go girl  you're pretty  and smart  and you can do  and then the  bane of the  fucking existence  of twitter  the white knight  the guy that  comes swooping  in  that thinks  he's the guy  I had to deal  with this  when uh  when I fucking  uh threw the  model out of my 
[01:08:00]  fucking house  when uh  Melissa took a  fucking hike  I had to deal  with the white  knight  you  dude you don't  have to settle  for him  oh you know  what if I had  you I'd treat  you you fucking  losers  all these cock  blocking  first of all  you don't have  enough followers  to get her  get your  fucking tweet  followers up  she only dates  famous celebrities  on the d level  it is amazing  how many  fucking  just gross 
[01:08:30]  little  cock blockers  fucking  they probably  try to pull  the chicks  out of strip clubs  yes  I can show you  what a real  relationship  you know  oh man  they fucking  get on there  and I've read  the comments  like from our  blogs and  things like that  and all the  comments you see  these guys are  just peppered in  there with a  hey  you know  oh I don't  I don't know  why you were  even with him  in the first  place  oh you could  do so much  better  you know  oh if I  had you  and then they  just list the  great things  they would do  shut up  you don't even  have a car  I bet 
[01:09:00]  but they don't  even if they do  they don't have  a nice house  to take her back  no  they're in a  big giant yard  exactly  big giant  fucking jacuzzi  and pull  a lot of laughs  in movie theater  fuck yeah  yes  no the white knight  is great  I see him all the  time on other  people's like  if a girl  tweets some  troubling little  thing and then  they just gotta  comment  uh  or a facebook  when they tweet  some fucking  horrible tragedy 
[01:09:30]  they're going  through  they try to be  the shoulder  they can cry  on  yuck  when people  try to put  you down  yeah  what you need  to do  is pick  yourself up  oh a  jimspiration  I'm gonna  send her  a jimspiration  send her a jimspiration  go ahead  a jimspiration  that's all she needs  she's already got a  dick in her fucking  ass  she needs a jimspiration  when people try to  put you down  oh  oh imagine

[01:11:00]  other tack  because they know  they can't get her  the white knight  actually thinks  they can get  these girls  i like the white  knight better  than that guy  because that guy  is being  at least the white  knight is just  being the fucking  the blithering  douchebag that he  is  true  but the other guy  is trying to  pretend that he's  not into her  right  right  yes  angry because he  can't have her  girl  I want you  because that guy  will play the white  knight role  he thought would  work  yes  and maybe he  has in the past  of course he has  he calls her a  fucking  calls her a cunt

[01:23:00]  those yesterday  yeah  let me grab  those puppies  it's an icebreaker  she had a very  wet looking mouth  and I mean that  in a complimentary  way like she'd  probably be very  glossy  yeah like she'd  be fun to kiss  and she'd probably  be fun to receive  oral sex  yeah  yeah  I'd probably say  that while she  was doing it  like this is fun  thank you  thank you for  doing this  what's better than  a sloppy  fucking blowjob  it's the best  you like them  sloppy  fucking  foamy  yeah  the hands 
[01:23:30]  gotta do  what the mouth  ain't doing  at the time  yeah  you know  unless she has  awful breath  that's terrible  have you ever  have you ever  smelt a waft  of um  breath really  from  yes  really  yes  oh my god  not good  when it's dried spit  where from the  the garlic  queen of bayonne  who you  who you with  that has  just a regular  girl  yeah  yeah  a lot of them  are not very  uh  not very fucking  aware  that's amazing  how many people  have  we all have it  sometimes  but there are  people who  always have it 
[01:24:00]  wow  i fooled around  the girl  until it  flew breath  oh man  really  yeah i just  got it  to blow me  my dick  was like a  fucking  i was packing  like one and a  half  flew breath  was all over  the room  oh yuck  one and a  half  petri dish  mouth  aw  that uh  hit and run  driver  the fucking  one  he's on the  cover of both  pages  on both  papers today  yeah  he's the  guy  they say  that shot  the original  50 cent  now that's 
[01:24:30]  the gangsta  dude  that uh  i guess  fitty got  his name  from  yeah  the original  50 cent  was a small  guy  he was uh  i think he hung  out with eric b  and rakim the  rappers from the  80s he's like on  the back of one of  their album covers  yeah  i saw a documentary  on him he was a  very very feared  guy  and that's the  guy that killed  him  so how is he  out  with the ability  to kill a  family  how is he not  in prison  oh he's a bad  i don't know 
[01:25:00]  i don't know  what the  circumstances were  maybe he's  never been proven  that he killed  him they're  saying he did  i don't know  i shouldn't say  that  did he go  to prison  was he ever  in prison  oh he's been  in jail  but let's see  this is the way  to do it  read the paper  oh he did  can he say  he did eight  years for that  okay  how do you  do eight  years for  killing  somebody  how does  it happen  i don't  know  i guess  i guess  they didn't  um  i guess 
[01:25:30]  they didn't  feel it  was uh  just like  a premeditated  murder  they get  these lawyers  to fucking  plea these  things down  but that's  just it  it shouldn't  be eight  years  guys should  have gotten  life in  prison for  murder  and then  you'd get  these uh  this young  couple  would uh  still  and their  baby would  still be  alive  yeah he  got uh  it was  in 87  uh  he killed  him and  then uh  oh in 87  he'd probably  be out  anyway even  if he got  like 25  years  yeah you'd  have to  really fuck  up to not  get out  yeah 
[01:26:00]  let me have  a picture of  50 cent  like why  why would  they  this is why  the post is  fucking the  post  right  the biggest  photo  in this  entire  thing is of  curtis  jackson the  rapper  50 cent  yeah  small picture  of the real  50 cent  or the original  50 cent  small picture  of this guy  who allegedly  drove the car  tiny picture  of the couple  and a giant  picture of  50 cent  just to tie  him into the  story  yeah there's  no reason  stinks  there's no  reason he has  nothing to do  with this story  whatsoever  but they want to 
[01:26:30]  like have you  turn the page  and go oh  what's that  oh 50's  involved  well they  did they get  him or  they  they're still  looking for  him  they know  who he is  what a  fucking  piece of  shit  I think  his  biological  mother  said that  he's going  to turn  himself in  oh yeah  I wonder  what his  circumstances  were  he's probably  drunk again  oh yeah  maybe he was  drunk  so what's  the work  that can get  you on  now  leaving the 
[01:27:00]  scene of an  accident  is a lot  less than  drunk driving  manslaughter  can they  though  if  hell yeah  now they can  sure  leaving the  scene of an  accident  manslaughter  I would think  so  no but that  doesn't make  it manslaughter  if you leave  the scene of  an accident  involuntary  manslaughter  if you're  reckless  how can they  prove that  if you just  panicked and  left  but  he killed  him  but it's  worth it  drunk driving  but leaving  or not  wouldn't it  still be  something like  vehicular  manslaughter  I mean I  don't know  yeah I mean  manslaughter  you'd think  would stick  because he was  driving regardless 
[01:27:30]  of an aggravated  leaving  but yeah  sometimes there  are accidental  deaths  and then I  considered  involuntary  okay maybe  involuntary  manslaughter  although who  knows whose  fault it  was  it might have  been the  liberty  they say  he was  going 60  oh  how  what was  the speed  of it  like 30  and they  can look  in the  computer right  and see  on the car  maybe  maybe  because a  bmw might  have one  of those  and I  think it  was like  a 2010  they're  amazing  at figuring  that shit  out  they look  like  fucking  skid  marks  in their  underwear  no  they look  at skid  marks on 
[01:28:00]  the road  witness  testimony  yeah  believe me  this guy's  not just  going to be  like oh  here's a  ticket for  leaving the  scene  go about  your business  you don't think  he's just  getting reckless  driving  yeah  yeah  this guy's  definitely  going up  for manslaughter  manslaughter  and he's  guilty of  fucking like  three deaths  because the  kid was  born alive  that's  crazy  good  this guy's  a fucking  he looks 
[01:28:30]  like a  banner  citizen  doesn't  he  well he  doesn't  look like  he looks  he doesn't  look like  he looks  like a  problem  but not  like a  triple  murderer  he doesn't  look like  the guy  that did  this  no  no  because he  doesn't  have a  the picture  they have  of him  isn't that  much  he looks  like an  older  guy  he looks  like about  35  40  he doesn't  look like  a young  thug  in that  picture  probably  right after  he was  busted for  drinking  and driving  two weeks  ago  yeah he's  probably hung 
[01:29:00]  over  so he was  busted  when  for drinking  and driving  two weeks  ago  two weeks  ago  wow  that's gotta  suck  jesus  wow  i bet he  didn't have  a license  too  should have  kept him  from driving  though  without a  license  you would  think that  these laws  are in  place for  a reason  right  yeah  so you  get this  guy not  driving  like a  hook  ticket  well  his license  holy shit  he is  foreboding  from driving  this doesn't  stop him 
[01:29:30]  oh god  he's gonna  go to jail  man  yeah  he will  go to  jail for  that  yeah he  will  he came  back he  was just  wearing a  sweater  smoking a  cigarette  looking very  nervous  and then he  walked back up  the way he  came they  said on  kent avenue  photographer  snapped his  picture  um  he just  fucking  wow  you know  i bet he  was you  know  i can't  think of a  reason you'd  leave the  accident more  than just  you know  unless you're  drunk or  doing something  yeah  yep 
[01:30:00]  i bet  that sucks  killed three  fucking people  terrible story  it really is  yeah  um  nice uh  yeah that's  our our  second day  in a row of  the depressing  story break  right after the  melissa king  story  right oh  that was such  a happy  story  any more  tweets coming  through  yeah  hundreds  um  i did also  find the  full video  oh i've seen  that yeah  where she  queefs  what oh  really is

[01:35:30]  and the one  on the congo  don't forget  your library  con  yeah that's uh  that's what I  thought when I  saw it  fuck yeah  liberia  liberia  advice guys  to liberia  liberia could  be the biggest  shithole  on the face  of the planet  yeah  like on a  planetary level  that place  sucks  the fourth  poorest country  in the world  what's in front  of them  I don't know  I mean  it might not  be I'm gonna  guess african  countries or  somewhere  I would gather 
[01:36:00]  it's got to be  somewhere  uh  because  that beach  where was that  uh was that  west point  they said  don't know  and there's a  beach  and there's  no  there's no  sewage system  there's no  no sanitation  at all  so garbage  sewage  and shit  flow through  the streets  and people go  to this beach  where they also  go fishing  and stuff  yeah  and and the  beach looks like 
[01:36:30]  a giant  cat box  it's a giant  litter box  with big  fucking human  shits  everywhere  they fucking  it's uh  Liberia was  started  and I think  what the 1800s  it was  yes  former slaves  went over  it was the  uh  after the  the Emancipation  Proclamation  and Civil War  uh there was  this uh  kind of a  hey we'll  we'll send  you back  you know  hey we took  you here  and uh  now you're free  ah we'll send  you back  so they got 
[01:37:00]  this place  Liberia  and um  it was going  to be their  their homeland  yeah  and uh  wow  that didn't  quite pan out  very well  well they  they wound up  going there  and immediately  enslaving  the Africans  that were already  there  indigenous people  they enslaved  them  and Monroeville  is the capital  named after  uh  James Monroe  the president  Monroe  I thought it was  named after  the gay guy  from fucking  yes  yes  go to  Jim J.  Bullock  Boulevard  Monroeville  yes  this crazy cow 
[01:37:30]  sent city square  it was uh  and then they  fucking uh  what happened  what do you think  it was it was  all these uh  Charles Taylor  is that when the  problem really  started or no  oh right  yeah yeah yeah  there was a lot  of corruption  I guess because  they had so much  um  so many minerals  and stuff  there that was uh  yeah  that was very valuable  yeah  so  the United States  figured out  we'll put in our  own guy  and that was corrupt  and I mean  that happened  a lot 
[01:38:00]  in a lot  of African  nations  but I mean  there's no  excuse for  shitting on  the beach  like that  having  their towns  are  you can't  even describe  it's  it's more  than a  it's poverty  like  I thought  Rio de Janeiro  was bad  oh boy  but the  poverty in  Rio is  nothing  compared to  this  the poverty  there  is uh  literally  shit  floating down  the street  it's fucking  raw sewage  every building  is just this  fucking  slapped together  cinder block 
[01:38:30]  and tin roof  and wood  the horse shit  thing  uh  and there doesn't  seem to be any  like no one  seemed to mind  and there's no  effort by people  to just keep  the area clean  or the  like human  living conditions  like you can't  control your  poverty  but you can  put the garbage  over there  right  yes  it's like a  whole  country of  people  that have  absolutely  given up  on  on  on  living 
[01:39:00]  like human  beings  it's  it's  fucking  frightening  that that can  happen on such  a big scale  the uh  a lot of these  nations too  there's just so  much war  and they have  the warlords  and and they're  fighting the  government  forces which are  just you know  puppet regimes  yeah  uh  no one  that is uh  in charge  in any way  shape or form  cares about  what's going  on with the  people  they just  don't care  no  and and  the un 
[01:39:30]  is there  red cross  all of these  humanitarian  agencies are  there  just throwing  food at  them  and water  and without  it  they die  they're dead  without  there's no  um  ability  of these  people  to fend  for  themselves  it's  astounding  and they  went over  there  the guy  shane  uh  smith  shane's  crazy  he's  fucking  crazy  i hear we  might get  him on the  show  yeah we can  have him  i'm sure  him and uh  there's a bunch  of those guys  but there's another  guy who goes out  on a lot of  these uh 
[01:40:00]  sarush who's  really good  yeah  which is  another  just  what a  great place  but they put  themselves in  tremendous  danger  yes  and they go  to places  i would never  ever  i mean there's a lot  of places i  wouldn't go to  but these are  places that most  journalists wouldn't  even want to go to  right exactly  how can you describe  the liberia i mean  they talk to uh  like the warlords  would give themselves  weird names  that was the funniest  part yeah  i'm watching and  and the warlords  bin laden  bin laden  and and uh  general rambo 
[01:40:30]  they'd give themselves  frightening names  they wanted to uh  scare their enemies  yeah so uh  the thing that got me  was uh  the one that was  called mosquito  general mosquito  because uh  mosquitoes are very  scary there because  they carry malaria  yeah it's terrible  and then another  warlord called  himself general  mosquito spray  yeah because he  thought he could  kick general  mosquitoes ass  and i love how  they're all  generals yeah  uh no one has to  work their way up  the ranks yeah  there's no lieutenant  or corporal or  uh anything uh 
[01:41:00]  or yeah a major  they're just general  butt naked  general butt naked  he was joshua  blahy  yeah  general butt naked  uh and what he  was talking about  was just amazing  to me  uh sacrificing  children  eating their hearts  eating their hearts  cannibalizing their  enemies uh  uh carrying around  vaginas and wallets  yeah  for power  like you'd you'd  cut out a vagina  how you do that i  don't know it's  almost like a donut  hole  yeah  how do you get it 
[01:41:30]  you put you  you layer between  two chairs and you  step on our asshole  really hard it just  falls out  it pops out like a  bearing  yeah it's an old  trick  you need a bearing  puller  holy shit  yeah it's an old  trick uh  and and and they  just they're savage  absolutely savage  when you realize  these are all these  ex-generals are alive  yeah and they  like i know at least  blahy and i think  another one have been  they were not  convicted of war crimes  yeah  because they converted 
[01:42:00]  to christianity and  they were saved  so now he's a  preacher  and the other one  another one i think  general rambo is a  preacher  and when you watch  these guys talk to  crowds or to  audiences you can  see why they had  power because they're  really all of them  are smart guys  they speak very good  english  yeah uh  they they are able  to captivate people  with their words like  they're charismatic  yep  and shane said that  while he was there  with butt naked who  was a terrible  fucking 20,000  people he killed  20,000 raped 
[01:42:30]  but not with bombs  like close up  killing  close up  horrid  torturous killing  yeah genital mutilation  he's done it all  this guy's got the  fucking trifecta  yeah  and he said he found  himself liking him  he was a  he was a charming guy  that's just  a real strange  circumstance right there  that he put himself in  a scary fucking place  because what happened  when they got the one  guy out of jail  general bin laden  yes bin laden  that was scary  when they had to  bribe the police 
[01:43:00]  to get him out of jail  and then you don't  know if the police  are just gonna  put you in there  take your shit  there's the monkeys  running into the  fucking the jail  did you see the  little chimp  little monkey  a wild monkey  in the police station  just jumping up and  down  and the guy  the guy's  shane was laughing  he's like  i'm here  it's gonna be the  police station  there's a monkey  yeah  he's like what's  what's a monkey  doing here  and they are the  one guy you can hear  the guy going  you're not filming  here you didn't  ask me  yes  like there's so  many ways to 
[01:43:30]  offend people  that you don't  think of  and he fucking  he navigated it  all man  i guess you  have to have a  certain amount  of money  to pay these  guys off  that's what  it's all about  over there it  seems is uh  you get enough  money you gotta  pay people for  everything there  and the police  the authority  over there which  is just nothing  but corrupt  uh people  they will come  up with a  thousand reasons  why you need  to give them  fucking money  uh or something  not pleasant  will happen to  you  and he they  they got bin  laden out so  they could  interview him  and they take  him to where  he wants to  go to a  rooftop 
[01:44:00]  yeah  and he was uh  you know he's  just like a  he looks like a  regular fucking  25 or 30 year old  guy wearing a  fucking wool hat  and they're on a  rooftop and he's  like kind of  describing stuff  and then there's a  gathering of guys  down on the  ground  yeah  and then and  then shane goes  that we knew it  was time to get  the fuck out of  there because  they told us  these are not  our guys  we can't really  protect you from  them  so there was a  because people  found out they had  money and they  bribed the police  and they knew how  much they gave  to the police  so now this crowd  was starting to  gather because 
[01:44:30]  they wanted to  get some fucking  money  could you imagine  constantly having  to be on your  guard like  even when you're  asleep  they were like  oh we stayed in  this such and  such building  and they gave us  a guard  two armed guards  to guard the  building we were  sleeping in  the Congo one  yeah yeah  that was the  Congo one  and it's like  24 hours a day  7 days a week  your entire  life  you're looking  around wondering  who's going to  torture or kill 
[01:45:00]  or fucking rob  you  it's an amazing  horrible place  I've gotten into  watching their  documentaries because  I love them  yeah they're really  good and they're  just they're done  in a regular style  of like real  speaking  yeah it's just  like let's get  the fuck out of  here yeah it's  like oh they're  laughing like fuck  that's hilarious  or this place is  shit  yeah yeah  regular guys  in amazing  places  they don't have  the smugness  of most  journalists  no no  or the  let's make it  look perfect  unless they  kind of just 
[01:45:30]  tell you the  story  and it's  kind of gritty  and it's  I don't know  there's something  very very  realistic about  the way they  tell the story  which makes it  scarier too  because it's  more you don't  get the feeling  that these people  are being treated  with this  kind of respect  that the press  is supposed to  get or this  impunity that the  press is supposed  to get like they  just hold the  press card and be  like oh well we  can't kill them or  people will be  outraged no these  are just guys that  are there with  cameras and you 
[01:46:00]  feel like at any  moment something  horrible can happen  to them yeah and  he said and I  figured this was the  case was the worst  place he ever went  was Juarez Mexico or  the most dangerous  yeah I was watching  that one I got like  halfway through the  Mexico Mormon thing  with the Romneys and  the fucking cartels  that footage is  brutal those  fucking Mexicans  are they are  definitely at least  catching up to the  Taliban as far as  cutting people's  heads off oh do  they love lopping  people's heads off  I think they're  worse than the  Taliban they're 
[01:46:30]  scarier to me  because the Taliban  are religious fanatics  and they will kill  you but I don't  know if they the  Mexicans I think  torture you like  much worse right  right right yeah  the Taliban does  it's crazy they  behead you but  they don't like  they don't behead 15  cops at a time and  then throw them in  the town square  they leave the  bodies and the  heads in public  yeah so that it's  a it's the old  warning it's the  it's the ancient  body on a stick  right out in front 
[01:47:00]  of the fucking  castle yeah it's  like what what  Dracul would do  in the  Dracul  Dracul  yeah Vlad the  impaler  right right  it's just a  I don't know  how Mexico's  really become  terrible like  people even  resort areas  if you're not  strictly in the  resort there's a  chance that you're  going to get  fucked up  and I tell people  who go to  Mexico like  you're fucking  nuts to go to 
[01:47:30]  Cancun you're  nuts to go to  anywhere in Mexico  right now you are  fucking crazy  because they cannot  protect you if  if the cartel  decides they want  to do something  right they're going  to do it and  the army can  stop them but  where's the army  at a fucking  club med where's  the army just you  know they know an  American is in  there a wealthy  American or  yeah they could  just go right up  to the room and  grab you out of  there and that's  what this these  maniacs fucking  went to to 
[01:48:00]  Juarez with  cameras and they're  filming and they  said in the thing  that a lot of  times they kill you  for having cameras  they don't ask if  you're press they  don't ask why  there's a camera if  you have a camera  they shoot you  that's how Juarez  is fucking terrible  and he went right  down with a big  ass camera and  filmed all of it  yeah yeah I  don't get it I  don't get how they  fucking think they're  they're going to be  able to do this  without getting  killed at some  point yeah I  want to really want  to interview him  I definitely want  to talk to him  yeah he just seems  really fucking he  seems funny too 
[01:48:30]  like yeah he's got  a good sense of  humor but puts  himself in some  real terrible  positions and  they're extremely  wealthy they're  doing good man  yeah they have a  lot of cash that  site is tremendously  successful it's  getting bigger too  why would you do  that I don't know  send other people  out yeah yeah do  that send other  people that are  broke out there  that they're not  going to kidnap  or start doing  easier stories the  prostitutes of  France you know  instead of gun  runners of  Pakistan do the  softer stories and

[01:54:30]  it's just  terrible  um  have your parents  ever said like  leave us out of it  no  I think a long time  ago they realized  without them  there's no act  this is  very  that's  that's a very  interesting question  because  as I think  back  I think the  answer is no  really  and I'm no  kid  I  I don't think  I've ever  been with a  mother  how's that  possible  I think you 
[01:55:00]  have  you didn't  know it  no  I don't  think so  I honestly  don't think  I  really  yeah  no  how about  a father  okay  no I'm not  going to delve  into all aspects  of my personal  life sir  no  um  I think I've  only I've probably  only been with a  couple of  actual women  and the rest  don't ask  don't tell  they're not  capable of  conceiving yet  but was this 
[01:55:30]  a mom with  like a kid  in the house  and everything  no no  she wasn't  there  she was  it was just  staying at her  dad's place  downtown  really  yeah  she exchanged  me  sex for  a place to  stay nearby  nice  so I didn't  have to get  up so early  oh  but they  look different  their nipples  are way  wider  wider  yeah  and like  flatter  I don't know  there's something  that goes on  with a woman's  nipples after  they're pregnant  you're absolutely  right  there's this  darker discoloration  uh  they're more  disc-like or 
[01:56:00]  something  yeah  thicker  um  because they're  filled with milk  I know through  pictures  life-giving milk  photographs  and videos  it looks like  they have  like coins  or something  they get  trade  yeah  like a pog  yeah  Iraq  pogs  no  I like a tit  that looks like  a fucking  dunce cap  I like a big  fat nipple  on top of it  it drives me crazy  yeah  just a big  stupid fuck  it like the  retard propeller  hat  fucking look  yeah  a retard  beanie  a beanie 
[01:56:30]  nipple  uh  wow  so um  when did you  have a  sexual intercourse  with this mother  um  last night  oh it was  last night  yeah  how was it  it was pretty good  did you just  meet her  um  yes I did  first night  and you had sex  yeah  that's fucking nice  pretty much  it's a new day  how did uh  how'd you swing that  social media  fucking social media  yeah  so you met some girl  on like the twitter  or the  I said I need a place  to stay downtown  do I know anybody  are you kidding  that sounds dangerous 
[01:57:00]  on twitter  uh  yeah I think on twitter  or facebook  do you know how dangerous  internet girls can be  no they cannot be dangerous  really  I mean  you're probably right  whoever gets hurt  from that  women  yeah  it's not worth it  to men  it's gonna happen  actually nothing's  gonna happen here  so you put the word out  I'm not that strong  but I'll beat the fuck  out of a woman  it's a great bumper sticker  so you put the word out  that like you need  a place to stay  I was like  does anybody I know  have a place downtown  I assumed like a friend 
[01:57:30]  would  oh you assumed like  somebody  and then this girl  was like I do  did you  which  did you follow her  on twitter  I did after that  so I could dm her  if you're having sex  with a girl  that you don't follow  that's really bad  what does she look like  do you have a picture of her  no  I don't do that thing  taking pictures  does she have long  on her twitter  I don't do that thing  you know photography  what's the other face  looks like  what was she on  one of ten  uh  New York

[02:09:30]  to wonder  I didn't want  to find someone's  email password  again and try  to like look up  what they're  doing  I get to uh  if I'm in a  relationship like  yeah I get too  fucking connected  to to think  that to do  that can't do  it it depends  on how it is  going in though  I'm with you  but I'm also  with him  like I get  menage a  twilight  my little asshole  is open for  business  so like how  long were you  together before  you guys did  this or did  you start  quick like a  few weeks  wow  see that's how 
[02:10:00]  you start  right off the bat  right off the bat  you can't  all my friends  that I told  all my comedian  friends are like  how can I  arrange that  you can't  move back  into that  no you gotta  start  that's gotta  be a starting  line thing  so what happened  she'd go out  and what happened  she'd go out  it'd be pretty fun  you'd know where  she was going  yeah we'd always  tell each other  it's like as many  details as you want  but it's like  I'm going out  with this girl  tonight  or she's like  I'm going out  on a date  with this guy  I might not be  home  and I'm assuming  if you're not  home  so would you  ever text her  and say what's  happening  like with your 
[02:10:30]  dick in your  hand  with my  oh like  jerking off  towards it  no I never  did that  I did go  and find her  on dates  before  she wanted me  to like  look across  the bar  and stuff  what  yeah  when he's  in the bathroom  he'd come over  and like kiss  or something  and then  one time  she went to  a movie  with a guy  and she had  me sit  in the back  and then she  feigned an  illness  and had to  leave  and then  she went  and sat  in the back  with me  she just got  a free  movie ticket  I didn't 
[02:11:00]  mind it  I drove  her home  afterwards  boy didn't  you  the guys  see her  as they  were  no we're  way in  the back  it was like  one of those  gigantic ones  the movie  does kind of  end at the  same time  oh yeah  we sat there  for a while  there was a  back exit  and a front  exit  oh yeah  nice chick  yeah  now she's  super christian  really  yeah  that'll do  that  so what  happened  I never  once asked  like why  why are you  all christian  I know why  this happened  she would come  back and you  would say what  happened last  night  yeah or like 
[02:11:30]  did you guys  do it  yep  would she give  you details  if I wanted  them  if I would  it's all you  have to  big cock  did he fuck  you hard  that's all I'd  want to hear  is how much  better he was  why  it's fun  no  I wouldn't  want to hear  how much  better  I wouldn't  want to hear  that  yeah it would  just be fun  if it was a  dirty girl  and then you  would just  what would you  get hard  I'd make her  sit on my  dick and just  tell me like I  wish that your  cock was like  his and before  she told me how  much better of a  fuck he was  she'd be filled  with cum and  could just go  about her day  from you 
[02:12:00]  from me  wow  yeah no I  couldn't lick  somebody's cum at  that  my own cum grosses  me out  somebody else's  would drive me  fucking up  would make me  crazy  now somebody  you're just  casually maybe  seeing  that you know  is fucking  other people  is okay  but uh  that's nice  but um  but I couldn't  imagine having  that's your  girlfriend  yeah it was  shockingly easy  wow did you  before that  did you ever  think you could  do that  fuck no  you'd be like  jealous and  no way in the  world  yeah  how the fuck  did you decide 
[02:12:30]  then  because I got  cheated on  and it was like  what the fuck  what am I doing  this anymore  oh you got  cheated on  yeah  why bother  good fuck  at least I know  it  who fucked more  people in a  relationship  I did but it  became this weird  competitive thing  for a little bit  and I kept  trying to tell  like it's not  competitive  just do what  you want  and I'll just  do what I want  early on  like the first  like five or so  was there any  jealousy at all  between you two  yeah but only  like only like  a little bit  a slight amount  or if I bone  somebody that she  knew  oh yeah  knew about 
[02:13:00]  you know  did you want her  fucking comedians  though  no  yeah it seemed  like that  wouldn't  yeah  that's one where  comics are assholes  they'll like  hold it over your  head  oh man  you know  who needs that  maybe when I was  fucking your wife  last night  oh that was your  wife  uh-huh  oh fuck  I thought it was  just a chick  I didn't know  it was your wife  oh god  wow  I don't know  if I could do  that  that's amazing  yeah once there's  lawyers involved  in a church  how odd  yeah  we got married  at the comedy  store  in the belly  room 
[02:13:30]  oh my god  wow  yeah  okay that  completely  changes  did she pull  any trains  with guys  like two at once  jeez  huh  let me think  did she tell you  yeah  she would have  told me  we were pretty  open  we were like  there's no reason  to lie  let's not even  start with lies  did she fucking  black eyes  that was the  other rule  oh only black  guys  all right  we gotta lay  down the  ground rules 
[02:14:00]  here  we had nothing  in the apartment  and yeah  no black guys  no black guys  no black people  excuse me  no Asians  she said  oh really  yeah but it  was just  we just never  got to that  yeah  just white guys  yeah I guess  so  wow  it worked out  Jesus man  that was from  before  no that was  not from before  that's bad  we came back  again  no I mean  a couple  minutes ago  that's not  the old one  that's a newer  one but that's  literally two  minutes ago  you need a charcoal  filter on your  seat  it's like  ABBA's first  release it didn't  catch on right  away  exactly 
[02:14:30]  what are you doing  you don't offend  me with that  spread  oh yeah  yeah  so offensive  oh it's terrible  come on  yeah  smart enough  when I was  when I was  when I was  married  yeah  after  probably  let me think  maybe four years  or so  yeah  at that point  some girl  that we knew  came around  and started  saying like  oh you know  she was getting  like a little  flirty with us  both of you  yeah yeah  she was coming 
[02:15:00]  out of the bar  that my  wife worked at  and then we  were all out  one night  partying  and we were  fucking drinking  and shit like that  and she  the wife comes  up to me  and says  yeah I was  just talking  with her  and she said  she wants to  like come back  and watch us  fuck  I'm like  all right  fine by me  and then I'm  driving home  hammered  yeah  and all I'm  thinking is  please don't  get footy  right now  like I got  I got this  whole fucking  thing  rolling home  waiting for it  to happen  and a cop 
[02:15:30]  could have  ruined that  whole  your whole life  would be different  oh god  your whole life  would be different  terrible  wait so what  happened  we went home  went to my  apartment  mine and my  wife's apartment  and went  inside  more drinks  and shit  like that  and they  started you  know making  out and shit  like that  so I was  watching  I was like  all right  you turned  on  I was like  no I was  disgusted  I went  inside  watched  television  I was like  I'm gonna  take a shower  I'll be right  back  so I hopped  in the shower 
[02:16:00]  and came out  you know  and then just  started joining  in  hi ladies  did you use  a condom  oh that was  the weirdest  thing  and to this  day I have  no idea  what happened  I was  my wife  was on  laying on  the couch  on her  back  this girl  we'll just  call her  Cindy  her real  name was  Cindy  and she  was on  top  she was on  top of my  wife  so they were  face to  face  and then 
[02:16:30]  I'm  having sex  with Cindy  from behind  as she's  on top  of the  wife  so I'm  able to  make eye  contact  with the  wife  from around  Cindy's  head  as I'm  banging  her  and I  was wearing  a condom  and then  when I  fucking  came and  pulled out  and stuff  could not  find the  condom  and I  don't mean  like it  slipped off  or it  I couldn't  find it  gone  like I  think it  went in  her  never  found it  never heard 
[02:17:00]  and this  happened a few  more times  with her  but never  brought up  brought up  the condom  or what  happened  to it  were you  hard  were you  like fully  hard  yeah  yeah  like crazy  it was  killing me  it was  like  slipped off  yeah  insider  yeah  I assume  because he  got cocky  thought he  needed a  magnum  and he  apparently  didn't  so he  put it  in  once  no I  didn't  like I  checked  the couch  I checked  in the  cushions  everything  I think  it slipped  off  and then 
[02:17:30]  when I  pushed  back in  it just  pushed  the whole  thing  way in  there  wow  I did  that  once  yeah  see  it could  happen  did you  shit it  out  no  yeah  I'm just  wondering  if that  rolled up  condom  is still  insider  and years  later  and at some  point it  breaks open  and some  sperm  goes in  there  and I  have  some  retroactive 
[02:18:00]  baby  that'd be  so retarded  that baby  20 years  late  he looks  like you  did back  then  yeah  exactly  afro  that girl  that one I  did it with  I was looking  for it  too  I was like  where the  fuck  is this  condom  and then  I heard  her from  the shower  yelling  ew  I had a 
[02:18:30]  condom  fucking  come off  like that  and miraculously  went back  to the package  and sealed  itself  up again  I don't  know what  happened  I put it  on but  there it  is in  the drawer  again  I'm  unmolested  we had  done it  a few  more times  like  that was  like  that was  like  became  a thing  with the  same  girl  yeah  yeah  same  girl  and  and then  I realized  the wife  was really 
[02:19:00]  into girls  yeah  and then  we wound  up  moving to  like  Boston  and doing  radio  I was doing  radio there  but we'd  come back  to visit  New York  and you know  hook up  with this  chick  again  and I  came back  to New York  wound up  getting in a  relationship  with a girl  that you know  we did it  again  with this  other girl  oh wait  was Sydney  not the  fourth one  the one I  knew  no  oh I didn't  know there  was one  before  yeah  yeah  yeah  oh this  is like  the prequel  that was the  prequel  to the whole  thing  I had no  idea  so then  I hooked  up with 
[02:19:30]  some girl  here  in New York  back at  NEW  and yeah  we kind of  you know  went out  it was  you know  and then  I was  like attracted  to her  so I asked  the wife  I'm like  hey  you know  is this  girl  you know  and I didn't  want to sound  too into her  yeah she's  cute and  stuff  and cool  I was just  thinking like  you know  it's been a  while  maybe you  want to  she's like  all right  drunk  all right  like okay  so I got  in touch  with her  I was like  hey  you want  to you  know  hook up 
[02:20:00]  and she's  like yeah  so the three  of us  hooked up  for like  an entire  summer  just fucking  staying over  the house  she stayed  over my  house  we were  just fucking  all the time  three of us  in the bed  all the time  my wife  had a rule  it was  don't have  sex with her  when I'm not  around  like just  like one of  those  fair enough  dude I've  heard about  that rule  so many times  that's the one  that gets  broken  never works  she would go  into the bathroom  to take a shower  and I'd be  all over  you know  just fucking  and then it  became you know  phone calls  like hey  what are you 
[02:20:30]  doing  and um  it was like  Greece  summer loving  except you  you were  fucking  you were  fucking  sandy  and Rizzo  yeah  well she was  acting like  Kenickie  and fucking  yeah so uh  that um  that pretty much  ended the marriage  right there  that was it  because then I  hooked up with  the other girl  and stayed with 
[02:21:00]  her for nine  years  really  what was the  first time  your wife  got mad at  that like  what was the  first thing  that happened  where she went  like hey  it's that cool  I think we were  upstate New York  and um  and we were  uh  all together  but I started  paying way much  more attention  to the other  girl than the  wife  like I'd be  like  like my entire  body is totally  entangled  with the new  girl  and I'm like  fucking  everything  kissing  and one  fucking middle  finger  is outstretched 
[02:21:30]  going  on the old  fucking  and the old  stand-by's  pussy  and meanwhile  Mr.  fucking  passion  is an  elbow  away  I'm just  like I  wanted no  part of her  I was just  like  not  be gone  yeah so  she started  getting a  little  and then  she uh  by the end  of that  that summer  she started  with the uh  you know  ultimatums  started coming 
[02:22:00]  in like  well you  know  I noticed  what you're  doing  I see  what's  going on  you know  uh  you're getting  feelings for  her  it's either  me or  her  like  alrighty  and then  one time  me and uh  me and the  girl were um  on the couch  uh watching  tv and uh  the wife stormed  out all pissed  and went to the  bar that was  right down the  road and she  walked back like  hours later and  fell through the  front door  just fell onto  the floor  and me and her  just turned around  we're looking  going  that's when I 
[02:22:30]  knew everything  was just fucking  I wanted to  start to hate  her  yeah  started to  literally hate  her  on the honeymoon  exactly  I wanted no  part of uh  of her anymore  and that's pretty  much what happened  that's the part  they don't tell  you about marriage  yeah  the I'm gonna  hate you  I'm gonna  literally hate  you  and uh  that was it  the only thing  that kept me  there was like  I didn't want  to tell my  family that I  was getting  a divorce  did you explain  to your family  what happened  right through  this little  microphone  years ago 
[02:23:00]  right through  here  hello  check one  two  mom  you listening  that's how I  tell my parents  a lot of stuff  yeah  from the stage  podcast  I know  you'll hear this  and won't talk  to me about it  it'll filter back  to you  you'll get the  info but we  don't have to  discuss it all  awkwardly  yeah  they fucking  all know  I'm a degenerate  anyway  yeah please  you don't think  I've had the  fucking tear  filled conversations  why would you  say that  I was just  joking  don't mean it  I've said some  horrible things  but I don't mean  them  did your mom 
[02:23:30]  get all upset  really  does she know  now though  I think so  yeah  you could say  anything  some things  are just  timing jokes  you know what I mean  it's like you make fun  of your own mother  it's not like you're  thinking of your real mom  yeah  it's like before  when you said you  fuck a mom  yeah mine  it's the timing  of that joke  anyone's mom  would be funny  there  yeah I could have  said yours  or I could have  said you know  that's true  yeah  I couldn't have  said Travis's  because she's not  around  she left  she left with  a Hebrew man  she did  yeah his story 
[02:24:00]  his mother  that's great  maybe you know  more about this  with the Jewish guy  yeah  was it that guy  that died in that  accident and left  the kid  oh man  no she's still older  tragic  what  the wife  the husband  and the kid  yeah  oh  the kid died too  yeah  he didn't survive  no no no  the story of hope  I know  the miracle  oh  that's it  and that's the guy  that fucking  hit and run  scum  I know  wow the daily news  is awesome  scum  so they found him  yeah well they didn't  find him yet  this is him  but they're like 
[02:24:30]  looking for him  apparently he was  in prison for murder  back in the 87  and he just got a  dewey two weeks ago  and now he's killed  three people  and yeah  and he was probably  drunk  I'm gonna just go on  record and say he was  probably drunk  probably is fair  you can say  you can speculate  it's probably  I say he was  definitely drunk  I wouldn't say that  oh okay  so wait  so your mom  left with some  Jewish guy  some Orthodox rabbi  no no no 
[02:25:00]  I don't know  what type of  Jewish  sect  he belonged in  he was a lawyer  but he  he wasn't Hebrew  because he didn't  he didn't look Hebrew  but  he was of some  what does Hebrew mean  what does he mean  he wasn't Hasidic  but she had to leave  her entire past behind  really  yeah  what was her  what was her past  what do you mean  did they get married  like me  she abandoned her family  and just took off 
[02:25:30]  with this guy  her brother  and her friends  abandoned everything  to be with him  Travis has a wonderful  little family now  and she don't even know  why did she have to  abandon you at 21  I don't know  did she still call  what do you mean  it's probably some  it's probably that male shit  but I'm saying that's part of his  that that was part of  whatever  you know  religion he  he followed  she had to leave  her entire past behind  wait  what 
[02:26:00]  that is not  I know  I don't  I don't know  what the hell it is either  if I were you  I would just find her  and write her hate mail  I know she is  I get so annoyed  for Travis  you know where she is  yeah  you gotta write her a letter  and just say  you're disgusting  why  Brown Heights  where  she lives  she's states and states away  oh really  that is no part of Judaism  no  that you couldn't talk to your son  no  it's not right  no it's absolutely not  not even an orthodox 
[02:26:30]  hardcore  he would make her convert  maybe  or live like a religious life  but you could always talk to her  yeah yeah  to friends  definitely your family  so do you think  that's some kind of  bullshit cult thing  probably  maybe she's in a cult  she could be  what do you think  did he wear a yarmulke  no  no he looked like  regular guys  suspicious  yeah it does sound cult  he was a divorce lawyer  suspicious  he was a divorce lawyer  was she married to your dad  when she started banging him  or no  uh yeah  oh jesus  that's a cult  no one knew  she was like the ideal mom 
[02:27:00]  too  from what Travis says  she was like  you know  the perfect little housewife  and mother  and then she just  fucking takes off  that's crazy  no I wouldn't write to her  Jim  not even angrily  no  no  I tried for a year  to maintain a relationship  with her  and she didn't give a shit  why would I  reach out 10 years ago  fuck her  and say the same things  you tried to maintain her  yeah  oh poor little needy  Travis needed mommy  what was she doing  not responding  no no 
[02:27:30]  she would respond  and we would speak on the phone  and this and that  but you know  at some point I realized  that I was the only one  who was  who was maintaining  the relationship  I was the only one  who was reaching out  what would she say  when you talked to her  nothing  we would have  you know  regular conversations  but anytime I would ask her  you know like  why are you doing this  to dad  why are you doing that  blah blah blah  I should say  this doesn't concern you  this and that  even though  I'm a grown man  I was 21 years old  I'm not like 10 years old  what's divorce  oh no  and so at one point  I was like  I'm the only one 
[02:28:00]  that's really maintaining this  I said so if you want to  call me  call me  and she never called  wow  how was that  oh hateable  god that annoys me  wow yeah  every time I hear that story  yeah I'm not gonna  I'm not gonna write her a letter  and reach out again  I wouldn't reach out  I would just  it would be a vindictive  just to remind you  of what a fucking rotten  non-person you are  I could do that  that would be that  you have a granddaughter  you don't know about  I would never say that  you're just not good enough  to see her 
[02:28:30]  why wouldn't you  that would get her  say hey your granddaughter  you'll never see  yeah  how about that  you know why  because  and I've said this before  if you google my name  she could find her  you know  so I wouldn't even  lead her on the path  to find a photo of her  oh true  you want her to do the work  no I don't want  I don't want her to do any work  but I don't want to  I don't want to say  oh hey by the way  you have a granddaughter  and then she can just google my name  and find my Instagram account  and see photos of her granddaughter  I don't want to  you know 
[02:29:00]  you don't want your mom seeing her  no  why would I want that  it's even worse though  because then she has to have  a connection in her face  it's harder to detach  with no  it was pretty easy  for her to detach  from everything else  that's true  that's true  yeah  I don't think she's going to  look at a photo of Riley  and say like  oh now I regret everything  nah but there's some weird  that's weird  yeah  that was a really strict  Judaism thing  with certain sex  I was under that impression  do you get mad during  like Passover  because she like  she passed you over  for a new family  no 
[02:29:30]  it's coming up  you know  is it  aw  yeah  that's some weird shit  she tore it away from you  see  she tore  no  oh boy  poor Travis  I know  I'm fine  no you're not  yes I am  a 21 year old boy  needs his mommy  you are affected  he pulled the nipple  out of your mouth  aw  poor guy  that's some weird shit  that's cultish  her loss  little Riley's adorable  yeah she's very cute 
[02:30:00]  her loss  she's very cute  good for her  man that's so weird  yeah that is weird  crazy  I mean but  it's not just me  like her  her and her brother  my uncle  were the closest  you know  that'd be like me and Donnie  yeah exactly  and then one day  Don just doesn't talk to you anymore  oh god  they haven't spoken in  11 years either  but isn't that some weird  like  is that a mental breakdown  of some sort  that might be some kind of  weird mental illness  worse than when she went out  with Adam Ferrara  you think that's what that is 
[02:30:30]  it could be  how old was she  she was born in 53  so that was 10 years ago  so about  50  50  yeah  whoa  it's like kind of a  who wants  yeah  what's the guy doing  like why would he want  a 50 year old woman  to start over  with like  wow  it's crazy  there's some weird  that you'll learn  something someday  about that  maybe  that was  because I thought  you were told 
[02:31:00]  it was a very strict  well yeah  I don't  I don't know  when  when that came  into this whole situation  but that's what's  always been  you know  the assumption  I love when this  discussion comes up  yeah  it's so tragic  it's interesting  it's tragedy  yeah  I can't fucking  brother's one thing  but your kids  it's such a weird thing  with nature  to abandon your kids  it's very odd  and especially being a father now  like I cannot  I can't fathom it  you know  yeah  it's very weird 
[02:31:30]  very weird  I mean I could see  your wife leaving you  but not the kid  well of course  yeah  shade 45 in place  yeah that's terrible dude  I feel bad for Travis  that's so strange  we pity you  thanks everyone  I pity that fool  I feel so bad for you  that if you cleaned my tub  and there was a ring in it  I'd let you leave  well  tragic story again  boy we're all a bunch 
[02:32:00]  of fuck ups  yeah  well not Travis  well  you've probably been  a degenerate though  oh yeah  here's my problem  Sam's been with  black girls  so that's like  his vice  it's not a vice  it's a fetish  healthy relationships  the only white chick  he's ever been with  is his wife  he just married  oh really  that's the only white girl  yeah  that's weird  he's just into  black chicks  his hair was straight  when he was a kid  and then he just  fucking  started eating that pussy  he does it to you  it's magic  yeah  it's voodoo 
[02:32:30]  some kind of  fucking voodoo  yeah  the succubus  from fucking  when we were kings  got Sam  when he was a little boy  I get some crap  all the time  people are always  sending me fucking  pictures of black chicks  going  do you find her  attractive  like I've said  I don't find  black women attractive  just don't  you don't  I don't  what about  this one  or that one  see  it's very  none  there's probably  one or two  that I'm like  for a black chick  that's attractive  but I personally  don't go like  wow

[02:33:30]  ponytail  good way  to describe  I like that  that's kind of  funny  not the little  ponytails  they're very  hard to make  they look like  duties in the  cat box  the braids  because they're  so fat  at the base  of the head  but the way  the rubber band  is  is this little  tapered  little duty  I don't like  that at all  ponytail  okay  like Stacey Dash  that's on you  from Clueless  Stacey Dash

[02:35:00]  your daughter from Lethal Weapon  you gave me the best clue ever  maybe that's why  your whole family  can't find each other  because they don't know  to use Google  yeah exactly  Lethal Weapon Daughter  image  he just put in mom  and send  I thought you wanted  like a current photo  she's a little nappy  but that's kind of close  I like it  let me see her face though  I'm trying to see  if that's the picture  from the movie  or she's older there  do you care  if the hair is fake or not  oh  look at her now  I don't know  how all that stuff works  that's terrible  most of the time  when black girls  have hair that's not nappy  it's because it's not  their real hair  it's just horse hair 
[02:35:30]  that's her  like that's her  in the bottom there  with the sweater on  like the bottom left  no no no  bottom second left  second down  one from the left  there you go  that's her  in like the movie  she was really pretty  there  yeah that's cool  that's what I want  that's what I want  yeah yeah yeah  she's very pretty  is that her now  no  she looks fucking hot  I don't like her  fucking Robert Plant  hairdo this lady  and now for like  for three or four days  I'll get Twitter  I'll get pics  from guys going  dude you can't tell me  this is it  no  and usually it's 
[02:36:00]  you know  like real fucking  like  like Hutu women  that are just  fucking  super dark  yeah yeah  yeah I've seen  pretty like  black black chicks  before  and I'm like  I just can't  see a woman  in there  no  I'd be so  like  conscious of that  I wouldn't be able  to concentrate  on anything  like like  I've had some  good sexual  experiences with  black girls  yeah  really  yeah  I've dated  a little bit  there's almost  like  there's a lot  of social pressure  when you're  like the looks  you get  but I've got  to have a lot 
[02:36:30]  of dinners  and you know  the pressure  she got  you on her arm  please  I mean both  ways  yeah  it's not like  because I'm not  exactly the white  athlete  yeah  black men  don't see her  with me  and go  well we  understand  yeah it's both  it's the equivalent  of when you see  the like  handsome black  guy with the  bleach blonde  fat white  dress  exactly  I'm slug boy  in a sweater  I love seeing  that  the black  guy with  just the 
[02:37:00]  grossest  blonde  like  trailer  the roots  showing through  just fucking  at the laundromat  like what are  you doing  with her  yeah  it's the  prize man  it's the  black prize  right there  there's a  reason she's  single  guys  that gots  me a white  woman  it's great  yeah I guess  so  yeah yeah  I don't know  like also  the whole  just culturally  I'm  I have  absolutely  no rapport  there  there's nothing  I could talk  about  on average  I'm sure  there's some  black chicks 
[02:37:30]  that aren't  you know  fucking  just gonna be  talking up rap  artists  and fucking  hair weaves  but for the  most part  I can't  carry on a  conversation  with a  black woman  like  it's just  so  they just  talk about  whatever's  on the  news  and TV  and stuff  exactly  and then  completely  argue about  it  I don't  know  when I  watch  world star  hip hop  I don't  want to  have to  go to  Denny's  and throw  chairs  around  seems like  a very  tiring  evening  being  tasered  kiss her  goodnight  and it's  over  but I  wouldn't  date a  girl like  that  anyway  like I  wouldn't  date  Jimmy

[02:48:30]  your work is done  wow  the most rewarding  flavor  in this world  people who are  having fun  Schaefer  is the  one beer to have  when you're  having more  than one  they're actually  a quartet  and the name  of the quartet  is we all died  of cancer  in 1971  that was a  black and white  old friend 
[02:49:00]  I love thinking  about how many  of those people  are dead  they're all dead  oh look at that  a black guy  in the commercial  he's the bartender  oh no of course  Schlitz  let me see  it's mullet  groovy  coming at you  when you order  a Schlitz  you don't think  about the month  it takes us  to brew and age it  a month  a month  to age it  is what makes  it America's  choicest premium beer  wow who's that voice  that's Jose Farrar  is it  yes  oh

[02:50:30]  like these  obviously these  beer commercials  had an impact  on me  you think  Jesus Christ  the fact that you  could sing along  had an impact  on you  because you wonder  they've had an impact  on everyone around you  because you wonder  it's like you know  I remember all the  words to them  and I remember the  imagery of the  commercials  and  well they're catchy  as a kid  they're catchy  as like a little kid  and then you grow up 
[02:51:00]  and they're there  dude I heard this thing  on brand loyalty  and how they want to  get you by the time  you're like 12  of course  wouldn't I  yeah  oh this is  Let It Be Low and Brow  tonight  Let It Be Low and Brow  tonight  tonight  Robert Klein  had a very funny  tonight  is kind of special  the beer we pour  must be something  more somehow  so tonight  tonight  let it be

[02:52:00]  yeah  exactly  he's like Fredo  but he's a guy  in a low and brow  commercial  I was stuck  the way human  resources wanted it  yeah  fucking beer  commercials  were always good  all those  cigarette commercials  too  I don't remember  those  I remember  the tail end  of cigarette  commercials  on television  but they just  stuck in my head  like  fucking  taste me  taste me  come on  and taste me  take a puff  and let me do  my stuff  what is that for  Doral 
[02:52:30]  that was Doral  and then  I'd rather fight  than switch  Tarryton commercials  I'd rather fight  than switch  cigarettes  yeah  they'd be like  yeah  it was like  the commercial  was somebody  with a black eye  and they got  their cigarette  Heidi Klum  I know a black eye  and it was like  they'd rather fight  than switch  their brand of cigarette  so obviously  they got in a fight  and got a black eye  but they're still  smoking the Tarryton 
[02:53:00]  someone was trying  to demand  that they switch  their cigarettes  exactly  I don't get it  his wife  she was making  him a cuckold  she wanted him  to smoke  Virginia Slims  Newports  for her date  yeah exactly  fucking cool  yes they want  to put Salem's  out in your mouth  while they fuck  me honey  you don't mind  that do you  go to the bar  you have some  old English  that was a  Winston  tastes good  like a  cigarette should  they all had  jingles  of course they did  the easy drawing

[02:54:30]  guys in their suits  at a bad table  table was much too small  way too small  yeah  card table  they're all having  fucking  have a winston  who says that  have a winston  yeah  then a jamaican guy  comes in and fucks her  oh  me and my winstons  look at this chick  going at it  she's saucy  can you believe  how accepted this was  now you guys are shunned  now smokers just shunned  yeah  me and my winston  oh  we got a real good thing  a real good taste  me and my winston  me and my winston 
[02:55:00]  we got a real good thing  got a real good thing  she looks like  uh  it's so weird to see smoke  yep  i know  yeah it's just a big  wafting thing of smoke  in the commercial  it doesn't look good  i saw this interview  with uh  who's the guy that took  over for letterman  for a while  the old guy  after letterman  after letterman  tom snyder  yeah  and he was  like 30 years before  he was doing some talk  show with like chevy chase  and maybe letterman  and a bunch of comics  and they were all  smoking cigarettes  yeah  it looks so weird 
[02:55:30]  yeah  there's a  an interview  um  with rod serling  and i keep thinking  is it david susskind  or mike wallace  i think it's mike wallace  and and yeah  and rod serling  and it's all black and white  i think it's like  kinescoped or something  and  it the room  is full of smoke  the entire studio  is full of smoke  when they go away  like nobody would ever  just say  hey can you just  wait five minutes  yeah  look at the haze  and smoke  billowing up  at them  it's constantly smoking 
[02:56:00]  the whole room  wow  god people  back then just  you smelled it  could you imagine  what the uh  like equipment  had to go through  back then  like their fucking  their studio equipment  the cameras  the audio stuff  just gunked up  because you know  you know  not only the host  and the guest  were smoking  everyone  the guy behind  the camera  oh yeah  everyone smoking  all smoking  since those early days  this is such  it's a great interview 
[02:56:30]  yeah if you get a chance  it's Rod Serling  and Mike Wallace  being interviewed  Rod Serling goes off  on censorship  and the ability  to put stuff  on TV  that  with freedom  that doesn't interfere  with the sponsors  and stuff  it's an amazing  commentary on shit  that's still going on  way back then  and sensitive racial issues  that he wanted to tackle  in certain shows  but he couldn't  because of political  correctness  is that it  yeah it's like right now  oh okay  pop that up 
[02:57:00]  we might as well  as we watch them smoke  make it loud  well depending of course  on the thematic treatment  you're using  if you have the temerity  to try to dramatize  a theme  that involves  any particular  social controversy  currently extant  pitiful portrait  of a shitty shot  for instance  a racial theme  for example  my case in point  I think  a show I did  for the steel hour  some years ago  three years ago  called  noon on doomsday  which was a story  which purported to tell  what was the aftermath 
[02:57:30]  the alleged kidnapping  in Mississippi  of the tow boy  the young Chicago Negro  who later became  my president  initially  then it was changed  to suggest  an unnamed foreigner  then the locale  was moved from the south  to New England  and I'm convinced  they'd have gone up  to Alaska  or the North Pole  as a possible minority  except I suppose  the costume problem  was of sufficient severity  not to attempt it  but it became 
[02:58:00]  a lukewarm  vitiated  emasculated  kind of show  you went along with it  all the way  fighting  as most television writers do  thinking  in a strange  oblique philosophical way  that better say something  than nothing  in this particular show  though  by the time  they had finished  taking Coca-Cola bottles  off the set  because the sponsor  claimed that this  had southern connotations  suggesting  to what depth  they went  to make this a clean  antiseptically  rigidly 
[02:58:30]  acceptable show  why it bore no relationship  at all  to what we had  purported to say  initially  what a smart guy  isn't that  fucking amazing  54 years ago  and it's still the same  what a smart guy  they changed it to  New England  because they didn't want  it to seem like  it was a black thing  it was a black thing  they made the black guy  just some vague  foreigner  and then they  made the locale  in the northeast  New England  instead of the south  and even still  Coca-Cola was like 
[02:59:00]  nope  this still has  these connotations  of the south  it's too  controversial  the south  that was just a way  of saying black  the south  black  racism  yeah  it really  what an eloquent  fucking speaker  that guy was  you could only  dream  of having the ability  to communicate  like that man  calmly too  oh  just fantastic  vocabulary  a good voice  delivery  a great voice  and the writing  he did  you know  you watch some  of his other stuff  even besides  the Twilight Zone 
[02:59:30]  stuff is brilliant  but then you watch  other stuff  even Night Gallery  he did a lot of stuff  for Playhouse 90  and a lot of older stuff  like the original  first television shows  he was a writer on  a lot of screenplays  adapted from other things  this guy was a fucking genius  he died way too long  unfortunately he loved cigarettes  yeah he really did  he couldn't give it up  he loved cigarettes  that smooth  Winston draw got him  yes  smooth draw  to deliver cancer  quite quickly  yeah  Rod Serley 
[03:00:00]  look even his picture  in there  he's got a cigarette  he was 50  50 years old  fuck  that's astounding  yeah  he had a lot done  holy shit  the Twilight Zone  hold up as  interesting works  it really is  yeah when it comes on  sometimes  yeah  yeah  unfortunately  with some of them  obviously  time goes by  and you realize  it was a little  obvious  or something  but for the time  especially  and some of them  just completely  still hold up 
[03:00:30]  but you can't  take away from  that guy's  writing ability  he wrote  many of them  he didn't write  all of them  some of them  were  he wrote the  screenplay  from a novel  or something like  oh now  they would just  have a host  yeah yeah  they would have  someone  nothing to do  oh you wouldn't  fucking have  the writer  of the show  stop  first of all  he's not  attractive enough  he's got big  goofy mouth  and funny teeth  they'd never have that  he wrote 92  of the 156 episodes 
[03:01:00]  wow  by himself  Jesus Christ  amazing  see I have one  I wrote one  for the new  Twilight Zone  but they didn't  want to do it  oh really  what was it  a guy buys a fedora  and there's a town  on his hat  there's a whole town  there  yes  that sounds like  something they would  do  what was it called  the new one  the heavy hat  and the man  we now bring you  the heavy hat  and the man  the hat is too big  to put on his head  this is a hat  you don't have to  remove before 
[03:01:30]  entering  the Twilight Zone  oh perfect  oh I gotcha  it's a hat  and you realize  the train's just  going in a circle  around the bread  how come the guy  doesn't notice  that there's  a whole town  on his hat  he has very strong  neck muscles  he's a high school  wrestler  your story stinks  did he eventually  come to know them  at all  yes he did  no but he walked  by the mirror  and he saw  like a to-do  on his hat  a to-do  going on  because people  would look  when he would  walk by  and all the  hustle and bustle  and somebody  said to him  there's quite a lot 
[03:02:00]  of hustle and bustle  on your hat  and he went  oh shut up  what's the big twist  usually the Twilight Zone  has some twist  at the end  that you go like  holy shit  I didn't see that coming  he sneezes  and the whole town  falls off  just destruction  this is the dumbest idea  I thought he would  go into the hat  eventually  and be living  on someone else's hat  or he finds out  he's living  on someone's hat  oh  oh  okay  he's got the hat  and he's trying  to figure out  he knows now  there's a town 
[03:02:30]  on his hat  he's freaking him out  so he goes to  some fucking  like mystic  and the mystic  tells him  he's got to travel  and see some guy  about what to do  to a hat  a travel agent  yes  okay  it's some guy  and the guy  sends him off  on a fucking journey  and after this  big long journey  he spreads the bushes  apart  he's on the brim  of a hat  and he looks off  and realizes  I'm merely  a man living  on someone else's hat  he realizes  it's a pimp's hat  because there's  bushes on it  he realizes  no white person  would have a hat  like this 
[03:03:00]  that was just  thick felt  that wasn't grass  that was  felt  he's got to  take this new  information  well he yelled  into the ear  of the guy  wearing the bigger  hat  and warned him  that he is  just on a hat  it's like looking  into a mirror  with a mirror  behind you  it's terrible  it's a great story  what an awful story  what is it called  the heavy hat  what  the heavy hat  and the man  what an awful pitch 
[03:03:30]  I bet Rod Sterling  got tons of pitches  like that  oh I bet  I bet he got tons  of like go nowhere  stories  Rod  I got a  twilight zone  for you  sit down  sit down  what is it  what is it  it's called  the heavy hat  and the man  interesting  oh god  that would be  terrible  it's like when  George Costanza  told  what's his name  Corbin Bernson  that he's got a 
[03:04:00]  case for him  for LA Law  I got a case  for you  Corbin Bernson  me and Corbin  Bernson  talking  that's fucking  great  I was so annoyed  last night  and I'm a big  Fios  Verizon television  fan  they do a great  job  I have Time Warner  cable in the city  and it sucks  you're trying to  scroll through  the fucking guide  and it doesn't  move  and then it skips  20 spade  channels ahead  it's a horrible 
[03:04:30]  service  terrible  and they got  nothing  they don't  have any  like  any of these  big fucking  you know  things  these features  so I'm  watching last night  and I'm like  alright  albeit a dumb  show  the stupid  Pawn Stars  show  but it was  one of the  new ones  I guess  with  Star Wars  action figures  and I want to  see what  they were  going to be  worth  you know  they had a  Jawa  and shit  and it was  probably going  to be worth  something  original packaging  yes  all of it  I was amazed  they got to  open up and  play with it  right there  on the show  no  you rock  play with the 
[03:05:00]  little toys  people scream  so the guy's  like I want  I want $10,000  for all these  and then the  toy expert  guy says like  well the  Jawas I've  seen them  go for like  $6,000  and he had a  Princess Leia  and a fucking  Darth Vader  and a Luke  Han he had  like a whole  bunch  C-3PO  so he's like  the $10,000  might not have  been that out  of the ordinary  so the guy's  like well I've 
[03:05:30]  seen that go  for $6,000  and he goes  well tell me  what this  collection's  worth  and then  a local  commercial  just comes  on  what  a local  commercial  just comes  on  for like  a car  dealership  you know  the local  commercials  you can tell  they're not  national  the volume's  different  there's a buzz  because the  fucking matching  isn't right  on the frequencies  and everything  was it Manfredi  no it wasn't  when you're ready  go to Manfredi  it was  it was a bunch  of them  it was like  five local  commercials  I was annoyed  but I assumed 
[03:06:00]  when they came  back  they wouldn't  come back  to the show  already in  progress  so they come  back  and that  they'd been  the show  had been playing  because it  wasn't a spot  for the commercials  they just  cut into the  show  left it  and then came  back  and then  a minute  and a half  later  they went  to real  commercials  where they  you know  have a  regular  you know  Campbell's  soup  and all  that kind  of shit  commercials  yeah  so I'm like  what the  fuck is  going on  so I tweeted  it all  angrily  with a  Fios  hashtag  and then 
[03:06:30]  Verizon  gets back  to me  Anthony  what seems  to be the  problem  please tweet  us and let  us know  what's that  your fucking  channel  you're cutting  into the  spots  with spots  and then  so I don't  know what the  deal is  but they're  doing that  and it's  happened a few  times  really  yeah  I don't get  it  it's terrible  when you tweet  and tag somebody  the company  are you hoping  to create  like a movement  behind you  yeah  yes  exactly  they'll all  tweet at them  and then  they'll answer  your problem  I have gotten 
[03:07:00]  some fucking  some results  from tweeting  and hashtagging  it  yeah  because these  are vicious  scumbaggish  fans  well  they're relentless  they're fucking  relentless  and they've had  the same issue  so they like  the fact  they get  a bunch of  other people  just smashing  the company  yeah  this gives  them a chance  to like  yeah  fuck you  and they  they jump  they just want  to smash  anything  anything  the frustration  that they feel  yeah  yeah  it's terrible 
[03:07:30]  so  yeah  so that's  that's my  my latest  by the way  I got a text  from that girl  saying  why am I getting  a thousand tweets  oh shit  and I'm like  unfollow  unfollow  oh  are they  are they being nice  no she's okay  yeah sometimes  it's a weird thing  when you  have contact  with a girl  yeah  in this environment  yeah  because  there's  you know  I have a hundred  and something  thousand fans  Jimmy's got  you're up to like  what two  two hundred thousand 
[03:08:00]  two forty eight  two forty eight  shoot  um  opie's got  fuck load  and then you don't  realize when you  say something  bring up like a  subject and someone  else is involved  that they're just  going to get  deluged with  with fans  that some of  them are nice  some of them  weren't so nice  you know  you just trust them  all to be cool  yeah  and they're not  and they're not  there's some  terrible people  out there  saying awful  things about  people you  love  it's like  what happened  here  so  it's kind of 
[03:08:30]  hard to get  some people  used to that  like they jump  in and  like sometimes  people say  uh  like I've been  with girls  that say  why don't you  you know  why don't you  mention me  on the air  why don't you  say like  you know  you don't  mention me  it's like  you don't  fucking want  me to  believe me  these cruel  ass  motherfuckers  will decimate  they have no  limits  no no  there's absolutely  no limits  there's no like  fineness to it  they just go straight  to fuck you  cunt  jugular  yeah  cunt 
[03:09:00]  they'll  they'll pick  on every  they'll look  at every  picture of you  and pound  the smallest  thing that has  plagued you  in the mirror  your whole life  you'll just  fucking  you'll leave  with zero  self esteem  you'll log  off of twitter  with no  self esteem  left  and once you  take that  you can't put  that genie  back in  once they  know who  you are  and they  start fucking  with you  it's done  it's fucking  over  they're terrible  but they do  come in handy  in a good battle  when you want to  harass something 
[03:09:30]  you want  fucking  you know  you want  those savages  what do they  say  oh they'll  just  oh verizon  they wanted  you know  to know exactly  what was wrong  so I told them  we'll see what  happens  I haven't checked  twitter but  they uh  oh I'd like to  talk about  fios  ok you know  what we haven't  taken a phone  call all day  let's go to  carl  in nyc  i assume  that's somewhere  far away  carl  carl  yeah  hi  what about  i had a 
[03:10:00]  problem with  the files  what happened  with files  no  files  they have  really poor  scheduling  you ever  noticed that  justified  on a  sunday morning  is only a  minute thirty  seconds long  no  no  i didn't  notice that  they have  odd scheduling  they like to  throw in  their local  commercials  they're trying  to buy  verizon  wireless  back from  the germans  well they  can't throw  it in  in the  middle  of a  show  you can't  like  cut off  part of the  show to  put local  spots in 
[03:10:30]  why are the  german  the germans  have verizon  wireless  the germans  got nothing  to do  with  you're lucky  there's not  commercials  you're showing  jews with  boo sounds  put over them  the germans  have it  just censoring  all the jewish  lines  you're making  him say  awful things  the humor  is not  the natural  from him  wow that's  a terrible  accent  no not bad  really  yeah i knew  what it was  well good  i think it was  just because  we were talking  about german  thanks carl  i'm glad we  broke that  whole record 
[03:11:00]  of the day  of not going  to the phones  for that  i i don't  you know  something i  listened to  the sam  roberts  after show  it's on  right after  this except  on wednesday  that's right  with a lovely  and talented  that's right  jim norton  has an advice  show  do you really  very helpful  sex advice  or what do you  do any kind  of advice  just life advice  that's right  do you ever get  kids that'll like  have real problems  with it like  in like seventh  eighth grade  only in my  only in my  personal uh  emails  he does get  serious like

[03:13:30]  of course and the sam  roberts debacle and  and i notice phone  calls you take phone  calls and as i listen  you're dealing with the  caller they're they're  contributing something  perhaps or just saying  something and then you  you talk back to them  and then it goes again  and again and then by  the time you hang up  you're not completely  disgusted with them i  don't understand it you  don't i can't grasp that  for the light of me i  only feel contempt hatred 
[03:14:00]  disgust and complete  embarrassment for  everyone's name that  pops up on that screen  it's zero to drop dead  instantly terrible if  they aren't telling me  something amazing within  two seconds i have no  patience none to wait  for the golden nugget  that's gonna fly out of  their fucking mouth  right because you know  what it ain't gonna  happen yeah well see  i'm still in the phase  of holy shit there's  people listening to me  i better be nice to  these true true and  you do take a lot of 
[03:14:30]  calls from people that  just want to blow smoke  up your ass with that  and then they start  let me tell you sam  roberts you're the best  on the radio i love the  show i'm like yeah maybe  that's what you're doing  i'm not gonna interrupt  them well true that  shit annoys me what  yeah just love the show  big fans just shut up  like you're wasting my  fucking time clearly  you're a fan of the show  if you're calling yeah  i need to hear it i don't  get it enough you need  the adulation from the  fans you don't get it  here all the time you  don't constantly get  reassurance from all the  guys here it doesn't come  up every now so yeah so 
[03:15:00]  i need larry the trucker  to tell me how great i am  the people that work with  you in this environment  don't give you constant  uh usually not you know  yeah for a baggy  you figure i'm a mixture  of ambien and vicodin  you're the best guy to  listen to brother yeah  great thanks uh are you  going to talk about um  about uh uh wrestling on  your show today talking  about the million dollar  man unless you want to  talk about it in the next  10 minutes in which case 
[03:15:30]  i just want to talk about  one thing because i don't  like getting into the whole  wrestling thing because  people really hate it it's  polarizing uh it is  polarizing it's like  talking about the race  issue or guns or now  drones which is the big  uh the big thing junkyard  dog you heard about them  right what happened to  the dog and uh and uh  whoever his partner was  gang rape oh really yeah  it's just weird yeah i  think i just got convicted  or just got or something  no it sounds great though 
[03:16:00]  junkyard dog has been  dead for years and years  and years so let me go  aww  well then i would have  kept going if it was  dead was he in an old  age home when that  happened uh no he was  uh i think he was about  uh probably in his mid  50s  oh boy yeah  steroids are a bitch huh  uh so ted di biasi  million dollar man  he comes out on raw  now what was this why was  raw doing all this  fucking  they like to theme  episodes sometimes so  this was like a blast from 
[03:16:30]  the past kind of a shit  so they brought out old  time wrestlers yeah rick  flair and the honky  tonk man and now did  they just bring him out  like to wave and smile or  were they in character no  they were they would be  in character like now  that's silly who's to  think that for years right  just somewhere not in  this ring but for years  they were still just  acting like that well  yeah the vince goes hey  20 years later why don't  you show up and be that  guy in the ring yeah the  million dollar man is just  he hasn't been wrestling he's  just been hanging out with  millions of dollars and 
[03:17:00]  his belt and just like  laughing right  shoving hundred dollar  bills in jobbers mouths  right he just does in his  free time and then it's  like oh vince called let me  go there exactly do the  exact same thing i used to  do exactly i like to bring  the old guys back it is  kind of a nostalgia people  that i saw jim duggan that's  cool jim he comes out with  this two by four i heard none  other than petrified wood no  billy gun did billy gun make  an appearance maybe he did  i'm a nice man yeah best 
[03:17:30]  fucking entry music ever  i'm a nice man and then he  tells what he wants to do  with the asses which is  fantastic what does he want  to do with them well i i  listen because it's amazing  the whole list what is he  doing  love them  kick him  kick him 
[03:18:00]  there was no ass man song last  night though they don't do  I'm an ass man now. It's PG now.  You know what it's his theme song?  I'm an ass man.  It's the greatest song ever.  And it's got a second verse.  No entrance music we've learned has a second verse.  But this was so good.  This is my favorite line.  When he talks about surprises. 
[03:18:30]  I love it.  And he'd just come to the ring shaking his ass.  Yeah.  He's up on the fucking turbuckle.  He's an ass man.  I love asses.  Fucking rules. He loves asses.  He loves asses.  Would girls shake their ass when he comes in?  No, he would shake his ass.  Oh, yeah.  It's not his ass, not anyone else's.  Why would he kick asses if he's an ass man?  I get sticking to him.  I don't know.  That's him last night. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, my God.  But he came out with the tag team.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  So it wasn't...  You know, that's the road dog.  Well, the road dog.  There's the ass man.  He's got his little tights on.  But if you look, they had to take Mr. Ass.  It's just a lip print now.  It doesn't say Mr. Ass.  How could they do that to the ass man?  Look at Billy Cut.  It's hilarious seeing his fucking face.  He's smiling.  He's so happy.  He's the ass man.  Oh. 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  Uh-oh.  I think the ass man needs a little Rogaine.  What happened to the ass man's hair?  Are you ready?  You getting psyched out?  That's a lot of people.  No.  You aren't?  I'm just ribbing.  I know you're ready.  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages.  Yes.  Tonight, D-Generation X proudly brings to you, in five-time, WWE Tag Team Champions League.  That was all the world. 
[03:20:00]  Of course.  You'd be right there in the crowd.  I was right there years ago.  The badass Billy Gunn.  That was it.  And then he's going to give them this sad to listen to.  Isn't it?  It really is.  And of course, if you're not down with that, we got two words for you.  Yeah.  But they all have like crow's feet.  I know.  They're wrinkling.  Oh, and they're fucking wrestling.  They're wrestling. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's just boxing.  Oh, he's doing his little dancing.  This is retarded.  Good thing the other guy was so weary.  This is retarded.  Oh, you don't want to see like these guys wrestling.  The trick is to daze your opponent enough that you can dance between moves.  Yeah.  This is like...  I like the early pin try.  Yeah.  I think I can get it now.  It never works.  This is like when Warren did that show in the 90s.  And the drummer started doing a drum solo, see? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  And it was at a small club.  And Warren was huge at one point in the 80s, you know?  Yeah.  And the drummer's playing the drums.  And he goes, ah!  And then he threw his sticks into the audience.  And you literally heard...  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  On the floor.  You know?  It's not like the old days.  No.  It's not like the old days.  The story with Mr. Ass and the Road Dog is that they hired them to be like backstage guys. 
[03:21:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And then they were like, oh, we can make a couple bucks.  And they started working them on house shows.  Oh.  So they just put them back in the ring on non-televised shows.  Oh, boy.  Because they're just backstage anyway, so...  They're there.  They're hanging out.  That was a pretty good move by Billy Gunn for being, you know, 60.  How many non-televised shows do they have?  They do three or four a week.  Oh, Jimmy's got a goal.  Yeah, I got an audition and...  Ooh.  You have an audition?  Ooh.  Oh, but break a leg, Jimmy. 
[03:22:00]  Are those your sides?  Bust the gam.  Yeah.  You want to try it?  Yeah.  You want to try it?  I did that, sure.  Huh?  They would love it.  Oh, they'd love it if you did it over the air.  Good point.  Didn't we do that to Than once?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Years ago.  It cost him to get more.  It cost him to get more.  Yeah, yeah.  We made him do the audition live on the air.  Oh, yeah.  There's also that.  He wasn't going to get it.  Believe me.  Man had no fucking product sale charisma.  None.  Yeah.  So, to wrap up with our big wrestling break before we go, Ted DiBiase comes out. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  He was just a manager, by the way.  Ted DiBiase is not exactly in wrestling shape.  No.  Million dollar man.  Million dollar man.  Not quite.  He did not invest his money in a personal trainer.  Oh, okay.  I saw Piper do this where they brought him back in and he had to fight against somebody,  but then his student got to ref the fight and I saw him at the comedy store and I was  like, Piper, that was completely irregular.  That should not have been allowed.  There was a definite conflict of interest on his part, and I think it cost your opponent 
[03:23:00]  the match.  Right.  The referee had an obvious interest going in.  Yeah.  It's not a right thing.  I'm glad you told him.  Yeah.  Now, Virgil, who was, I guess, the million dollar man's, what would you call him?  A valet?  Black house servant.  He was like his house boy, or whatever you want to call him.  He wore a tuxedo with no sleeves.  Yeah.  Now, we know Virgil has been in some, well, lean years here because every appearance that 
[03:23:30]  he does at these comic cons and wrestling events and whatnot.  Subway stations.  Subway stations lately.  He has a little table.  He's got, like, pictures of him that he sells.  From back then.  Yeah.  And you could take pictures with him, but he'll charge you money.  But no one ever is online at these events for him.  It's, our own Sam Roberts started a page called Lonely Virgil.  And it's full of pictures that fans have taken of him just fucking alone.  Look at the one I put in here yesterday. 
[03:24:00]  See?  They're always.  See?  He's in the background.  He's in the background.  With nobody at his table.  No one at his table.  No one at his table.  Well, let's look through the rest of some of these pictures from LonelyVirgil.net.  You can skip the video.  You can skip the video.  You can skip the video.  You can skip the subway station.  There he is.  Look, he's actually got Virgil.  WWE.  Virgil Superstar.  Superstar.  And he's selling pictures in a subway station.  Wow. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  All right, let's continue.  There he is.  Again, no one at his table.  You think he has to pay for the table space?  No, what he does is he's not booked at these shows.  He's not even booked.  Like, I know the promoters who promote these things.  Yeah.  And he doesn't get booked at the shows.  He has a card table or whatever.  And that Virgil Superstar flag.  Uh-huh.  And he just drives to places.  And sets it up.  And he just shows up.  And they don't tell him to go away?  No.  Like, all right.  I remember Virgil, though.  I love how he doesn't even have his own thing. 
[03:25:00]  He has to roll up the part where it says Ted DiBiase.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just so it says Virgil WWE Superstar.  It says and Virgil.  Yeah, because up here.  But it doesn't bother him that the banner behind him says Ted DiBiase.  No, no.  Because Ted DiBiase doesn't show up with him.  He just has the banner that says Ted DiBiase and Virgil.  If Ted DiBiase was right next to him, he would get so many more pictures taken.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Although he would then hone in on Ted DiBiase's stuff, much to the chagrin of the people that  want their million-dollar belt signed.  See, our own E-Rock back there, he had a million-dollar belt that cost a lot of money, a replica million-dollar 
[03:25:30]  belt.  It's a million dollars.  And he met Ted DiBiase and Virgil was there, and he asked Ted DiBiase to sign his million-dollar  belt.  And Ted DiBiase's like, sure.  And he signs it.  Virgil grabs the belt and the sharpie and signs the fucking thing, too.  And he's like, I didn't want that.  And then Virgil tried to get money, right?  You asshole.  I didn't want you or sign it on you.  You never had the belt?  No.  It's in...  Look at the photos. 
[03:26:00]  It's in...  On the left of the page.  Yeah.  And then Virgil jumps in.  And then he jumps in and grabs the fucking belt, like, to hold it, too.  He can't even Photoshop it out of the picture.  Virgil.  Fucking Virgil.  Yeah.  So now...  E-Rock looks upset.  Oh, he is so pissed.  We're unhappy, right?  No, not at all.  Ah, E-Rock is pissed.  I love it.  So now, last night, the Million Dollar Man comes out.  Yeah.  And what a surprise.  The crowd started to chant.  Yeah.  He's a manager, the Million Dollar Man. 
[03:26:30]  Uh-huh.  Do you want me to just play the...  Just play it.  I've got to hear it.  Here's the crowd reaction to the Million Dollar Man, right?  Okay.  I'll hear it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, if they want Virgil so bad, why is no one ever at his table? 
[03:27:00]  There's another shot.  Because he's become an internet sensation.  Just go to Penn Station.  Oh, my God.  Because he's become an internet sensation known for no one wanting to see him, and that gets  a chant going for people that want to see him?  This is like a paradox.  Because after Deadspin completely ripped off my idea...  They did.  And put it on their site as theirs?  Yes.  Did they really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Motherfuckers.  Sam started Lonely Virgil.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then they were like, that's hilarious.  And now look at him outside the front of us.  This is...  That's the most pathetic one. 
[03:27:30]  That one is my favorite photo.  In the yellow?  Yeah.  The one where he's in the yellow.  Because you know what that was?  There were people lined up outside that store to get another wrestler's autograph.  Virgil heard about this.  He showed up at the store, set up a table outside, and tried to get the people that were  online for the other guy.  So give him five bucks?  Come over to my table.  Give me five bucks.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  And yeah, now the crowd is chanting, we want Virgil.  We want Virgil.  At the Million Dollar Man.  We want Virgil. 
[03:28:00]  We want Virgil.  That was just like a chant for fun, right?  I would hope so.  Look at this one.  He's in the parking lot.  He's literally in the parking lot.  Ted DiBiase and Virgil.  Wow.  So wait, does this guy, that's his only way to make a living?  I guess.  He does these shows a lot.  I mean, he would have to take a lot of time off a regular job.  Oh, that's so sad.  It's pretty goddamn sad.  Yeah.  But it's getting him some heat now.  And don't feel bad for him, because he's a motherfucker.  Yeah, he is a prick. 
[03:28:30]  Prick.  He hustles people.  He does business the exact same way that people in Times Square do business.  What do you mean?  Like, he'll bring you over.  Like, you're a wrestling fan from when you were a kid, right?  Yeah.  So you see a picture of Virgil and the Million Dollar Man and Andre the Giant.  You might go just to look at the photo, right?  Yeah.  He'll see you looking at the photo.  He goes, oh, you like that one?  You'll go, yeah.  And he'll go, oh, what's your name?  And you'll go, oh, I'm Ari.  And he goes, oh, okay, Ari.  He takes the photo to Ari, Virgil.  He signs it.  He goes, Ari, we should take a picture. 
[03:29:00]  And you'll go, sweet.  Yeah, let's take a picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he'll go, $45.  You'll go, what?  And he'll go, $45.  You can usually talk him down to about five.  He'll start really high.  It's like Pawn Stars.  He doesn't try.  That's why he can't feel.  That's such a scam.  It's a scam.  I wanted $45 for the picture, but I'm happy with the five I got.  I told them.  Somebody should interview him after taking pictures of people.  How do you think that went? 
[03:29:30]  Oh, it went pretty good.  You know, I wanted more.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm leaving with more money in my pocket than I had.  Yeah.  Now, that guy clearly didn't want to take a picture with you.  How do you feel about that?  Well, I'm sure he'll grow into liking the picture once he gets home.  It's really a nice way of looking at things.  You know, obviously, he has to frame it, hang it on the wall.  I have a photo of my bathroom that a fan sent me.  Yeah.  It's signed.  He got it at a convention from Virgil.  And it says, to Sam, have a great marriage, Virgil.  It's hanging right in my bathroom.  I wonder what that costs. 
[03:30:00]  Probably a pretty penny with a fucking shyster.  Yeah, dude, I told them.  I saw him hustle.  A guy showed up with his girlfriend.  And he did his same scan, except he also added in, you know,  Oh, have your girl take a photo with me.  And the girl's like, Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.  $80 you got out of that guy.  He got $80.  What a prick.  Dollars out of that dude.  And the guy was like.  He's hustling at subway stations.  He looked like a rape victim walking away from that table.  That'd be funny to fucking go around a dark, dank corner in the subway  and you'd see Virgil just sucking cock from us. 
[03:30:30]  He's just fucking ripping some cock in his mouth.  All right.  That'd be $35.  You said $15.  $35.  I sucked a dick for $10, but, you know, I'm pretty happy.  He knew it was me.  He made me wear the bow tie.  The bow tie.  What if you're like, no, I won't pay you?  Does he, like.  He tries to intimidate people.  Does he?  With his size?  He preys on, like, nerdy wrestling fans.  Right.  That aren't going to put.  They're not going to fucking put up a fight.  Yeah.  Like, the few people left in the world that would be like, oh, holy shit, it's Virgil. 
[03:31:00]  And get nervous.  Uh-huh.  When you fucking abuse them.  Oh, my God.  He kills them.  God.  Yeah.  He murders them.  Crazy.  Have you gone down and interviewed him or anything?  I've tried to many times.  And he charges for interviews.  Wow.  Yeah.  How much?  However much he thinks he can get out of you.  Jesus.  He just charges for everything.  It's expensive.  Yeah, that's right.  Half the pictures on this thing I took myself at conventions.  Yeah.  Knowing that information, I'll go up to these conventions without him realizing I'm, you 
[03:31:30]  know, stealthy taking photos of him and go, hey, can I grab you for an interview?  And he goes, come back later, boss.  Make him money.  Make him money.  Come back later.  Make him money.  There's no one there.  I'm taking photos of you not making money.  I have documentation that you're not indeed making money.  Set up a whole website.  That's a funny website.  LonelyVirgil.net.  Yeah.  Is .com taken?  Yeah, I think, because it started as a Tumblr page.  Uh-huh.  And I think when I put the Tumblr page, some asshole just bought the .com.  Grab .com.  Because the phrase LonelyVirgil was certainly not in the vernacular before me. 
[03:32:00]  No.  No.  Well, that's fucking great.  I'm glad to see Virgil getting a little heat on the fucking oldies, old-timers day at  the WWE.  Ted DiBiase is just giggling at rings.  Oh, I'm sure.  Let's hit the fucking road.  Not you.  You've got to do your little after show.  Yeah.  Ari, we're a fucking pisser, man.  Great time.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  I like having you in.  It's a lot of good conversation on how fucking terrible people we are. 
[03:32:30]  I like just accepting your degenerate side.  It's great, man.  What are you going to do?  Try to live like a fucking saint.  Where are you going to be?  Oh, well, I'll be in Vancouver in a few weeks.  You guys have Vancouver listeners?  Vancouver, of course.  Yeah, Comedy Mix on March 21st to the 23rd.  Cool.  Let's do that one.  And I'm going to be with Norton at the Moon Tower Comedy Festival.  Ooh, with our own genie. 
[03:33:00]  With a bunch of people.  Bill Burr's going to be there, too.  Bill's great, man.  I love Billy.  That's going to start becoming like a vacation thing for comedy fans.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's no agents or managers there.  It's just comedians and...  None of the scum.  Where's all the fucking fun?  Yeah.  I hate those people.  Airline Pilot Reports drone near JFK.  This is like...  What?  I can't get away from this.  Oh, and my special.  I have a drone.  Do you really?  You have one?  I have one.  You gotta.  I fucking own a fucking photographic video drone with autopilot, GPS, fucking... 
[03:33:30]  Fucking...  Completely autonomous flight.  Wait, are you serious?  Wait, yes.  What?  Through all of...  Like, I could program it to go places on a map on my computer, and it will just fly there  and fucking come back.  I don't even need the remote controller anymore or anything.  Can you make it drop shit on people?  Yes.  You could make it go to a certain waypoint, carry out a thing that you have pre-programmed.  Yeah, there it is.  Whoa!  And fuck it, it's insane. 
[03:34:00]  But now, because these fucking idiots are fucking up, someone flew one near one of the  runways at JFK yesterday and came within 150 feet of an airliner, and now they're gonna  start regulating this shit.  Yeah, they're gonna start fucking regulating all my shit.  Dude, that's bad ass.  Yeah, this is the video from my driveway.  I took this when it snowed the other day.  You really don't need the music.  Like, it's just, uh...  Yeah, the camera's, like, unbelievably steady.  Wow, it's so clear.  It's on a gimbal, so it compensates for every move that it has. 
[03:34:30]  So you could drop a water balloon on somebody if you wanted to?  Water balloon, C4, fucking anything.  It really is...  It's such a nice, naive thought.  You could drop a water balloon on somebody and it's like...  It's wonderful, like, fun technology.  Like, I love this shit.  Have fun with it now.  And now, I mean, they are gonna...  FAA looking into pilot's claim and fucking terrorism. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, there's one.  Terrorism fucking task force is looking into it.  How easy it would be to use it for...  Dude, for all kinds of horrid things that you don't even want to say.  Believe me.  And you don't have to be there.  Wow.  No, you don't.  That's so clear.  Isn't that sick?  That's insane.  That's like fucking...  It's like in the movies.  Yeah, the parkways.  Have you tried to, like, use that cam to just, like, spy into people's windows from blocks away?  That's very illegal.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's illegal.  I have not tried looking in people's windows with the drone. 
[03:35:30]  I definitely know that's what I've been doing.  Would you be doing spying on the world?  Yes, absolutely.  I wonder what that girl's body looks like.  Some comic, some new female comic.  Holy shit.  I'm like, let me just find out.  There's bathroom windows.  Yeah, the parkway and the houses after the snowstorm.  How long can it stay in the air?  About a half hour.  Wow.  And, yeah, and you could...  It's got GPS and an autopilot, so I could put it up somewhere and then just let go of the controller. 
[03:36:00]  It also has a video camera with a downlink that I can watch the video from the camera as it's flying.  So I don't even have to see it.  I can see where it's going and work it as a first-person view of what's going on.  Wow.  Just like in Iraq.  There's that, and there's the screen of the front of it, and that's what I would see.  How much are these things?  Thousands of dollars. 
[03:36:30]  Okay.  You could get one for...  You don't want to have it like 20 bucks.  You could get like a cheap one, the inexpensive, not cheap, cheap, for like 300 bucks.  You could get one that you work with an iPad, and it's got a camera on it, and they're pretty fun.  And, you know, you could do some pretty good distance with them.  And then it goes up into the tens of thousands of dollars with the GPS systems, autopilots, sensors, all kinds of...  The retractable landing gear, so you could get a complete 360 view with the camera gimbal, which is another...  The landing gear pulls away, so you can have more access to the range. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, that way when the camera spins 360 degrees, you can see in the video...  It's up on my YouTube channel, by the way, O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  This shot coming up, you see the gear come back down.  That's where it comes down.  Yeah, because the gimbal on the bottom, the camera, has to be able to turn 360 degrees without picking up the landing gear.  So you have that.  And then just landed in my driveway.  Have you crashed it?  It's crashed.  Nothing major.  But I've had some bumps early on, trying to figure it out. 
[03:37:30]  Were you getting the feel?  Yeah, trying to get the feel of it.  And if you try it on windy days, it's really a bitch.  And that's what was weird, because yesterday was very windy.  And supposedly this came from...  And that's when they did it with the cops.  Like at JFK.  Yeah, which...  With the cops and the flyer lines.  Which to me was kind of like...  I don't understand how they would fly it that high.  That's a view from another camera, of the camera, to show how the camera gimbal that's on the bottom...  It compensates for every little movement and makes it really smooth. 
[03:38:00]  But this is all going to be fucking legislated and restricted.  I am no longer going to be able to fly this around.  You're going to have to register?  I would think there's going to be some kind of registration thing, but you're probably going to need a reason.  Like, what the fuck to you?  In my case, photography.  I did a spot on CNN about drones, about civilians owning drones and stuff.  And she was like, why do you have one?  I was in my case, photography.  I do like...  Which is true.  I kind of like the idea of taking video from altitude. 
[03:38:30]  It's kind of cool.  But it sounds like, all right, what are you into?  Yeah.  What are you really pulling?  I was going to get aerial videos of my boner in the backyard.  Aerial boner shots.  It really is.  But it's just so much like...  It's a great...  That looks like a crane.  Fun...  It's definitely...  Movies, companies are starting to use these.  It's so steady.  Doesn't it look like a still picture? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  It's completely steady.  You can move it around...  Movies should use them.  With the gimbal or with the copter itself...  Would have made Kubrick's life a lot easier.  Yeah, right?  Instead of running out...  Shots down the hallway.  Oh, yeah.  A steady cam, you just...  But they're using these a lot more.  That was before the retractable gear, so you can see it kind of gets in the way.  But there's so much fucking fun.  And I love buying new gadgets.  But now what?  Some idiot decides to fly it in front of a jetliner at Kennedy, and now they're going 
[03:39:30]  to fucking...  Would that hurt the airplane?  Oh, I could only assume if that got sucked in an engine, it would probably be an issue.  Oh, yeah.  All this metal.  I think if birds are a problem.  Yeah, if a fucking nice, soft, cushy bird is an issue sometimes...  How are birds not more of a problem?  I would think, right?  They're all up there.  And they just go so fast.  They travel up there.  Well, ask Sully.  He'll tell you.  Sometimes it is really bad.  But, you know, it's just... 
[03:40:00]  There is much too much responsibility.  And the chance of a problem...  Like, that's fucking...  Like, a great view.  I love that.  The chance of a problem is very easy if enough people have these just flying in the air.  You can't just have a thousand people flying these fucking things in the air.  Even I understand it, and I love it.  So...  Yeah, you can't have that many people.  I don't know what they're going to do.  It used to be with RC planes, you'd go to the field. 
[03:40:30]  It was a sanctioned radio control field.  And you'd just fly them in circles at about 100 feet in the air, 150 feet at most.  People did those everywhere, though, didn't they?  Yeah, kind of...  You'd just find an open field.  Just find a field, yeah.  That was fine.  Now, you can autonomously program them to fly anywhere you want.  So you don't even have to see it anymore.  That's the big thing.  You don't even need an eyeline view of these things.  So you could send it off somewhere and then have it come back.  If it loses radio frequency, it knows to just come back exactly where it took off from. 
[03:41:00]  Wagga!  It'll come right back.  Dude, people are definitely going to use that for evil.  Horrid evil.  Of course they will.  Horrid evil.  There's no other real reason.  Except, in my case, photography.  Could you murder somebody with it?  If you get velocity enough, could you just smash it into someone's head?  I would assume you could smash that into someone's head and murder them.  You could mount a gun on it, I'm sure, with a servo for the trigger.  I've seen somebody with a paintball gun mounted on this exact counter.  And they could fire off the paintball? 
[03:41:30]  And they had wooden silhouettes of people in a field.  And they were picking off every one of them.  And getting them good?  Oh, fucking accurate as fuck.  And hitting the mark.  You put a real gun on there?  Yeah.  Even a .22.  I mean, not heavy.  No big kick.  Or if you have C4 mounted to the bottom with, you know, ball bearings and nails and everything.  Just drop and let it explode.  And some important dignitary is speaking somewhere outdoors. 
[03:42:00]  Where are you going to stop that?  How are you going to stop it?  First of all, you don't know it's coming.  Second of all, what are you going to do?  Shoot at it?  As it's flying in towards you?  You wouldn't know it's there until it's too late.  From super high?  Evil will be done with these.  And they will take away my toy because of it.  Were these some of the evil things that you didn't want to mention?  No, because politicians are going to just be all over this.  And I'm doing a show Thursday about it.  Yeah, they're going to start doing shit.  They're going to start doing evil stuff.  Because if I could get...  I'm an eccentric millionaire.  But it's like you're talking about with your Twitter followers. 
[03:42:30]  Like, not all of them know the line.  Right, exactly.  There's going to be one of these guys.  Yes.  Especially if it becomes more affordable.  Yes.  It's so scary to think what people will do with these things.  Can they lift a human?  No.  That's pretty heavy.  But they're getting to the point where they're able to lift things that are a lot heavier.  And the heavier you can lift, the more debauchery you can do.  I've often spoken about the prison yard.  I'll say it again.  You can drop... 
[03:43:00]  What if during fucking wreck time,  you've dropped a bag of knives and guns in the fucking yard.  And then start filming.  And then just fucking hang there with the camera going and say,  Hey, check this out.  Let's see the murders that just happened in the next ten minutes.  Yeah, let's see what happens.  Just a whole bag of fucking screwdrivers.  Drugs and shivs and just...  Needles and...  Wow.  Just reasons for them to kill and things for them to kill with.  Oh, can someone please do that? 
[03:43:30]  That would be an awesome video.  Wouldn't it make an awesome video?  Oh, God.  There would be a moment.  They would all look at the stuff that dropped and at each other for about ten seconds.  And then as soon as the first person flinches to reach for a knife,  they'd all just run the hunger games.  And again, you don't even have to be near the place that you're doing this stuff with.  You just find it.  The program for the autonomous flight works with Google Maps.  So it uses Google Maps as the template.  And what you do is you just point and click where you want it to go. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  And it will go there.  And you program in the speed you want it to go, the altitude, how long you want it to stay where you send it before it goes to the next point that you want it to send it.  Wow.  So it's got a complete autopilot brain in it.  I mean, think of the...  How haven't they gone to the Pentagon yet?  I know, right?  Things like that.  How about the horrid things you could do at sporting events?  An open area arena.  You don't even have to be there.  Just fly it over the top.  And now you have thousands of people that are completely vulnerable to whatever horrid thing. 
[03:44:30]  They are absolutely going to take these away from everybody.  You can at least disrupt like a punt or something.  Try to like hit it with your thing.  Just tuck it down between the posts.  Fuck up his punt.  Yeah.  Very, very crazy.  Wow.  It's just hovering around in the sky.  Sounds in vain.  That sounds like...  That seems like so much fun.  Yeah, those RC things were fun.  Yeah.  This is a helicopter. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, this is the pizza delivery guy video.  There's just like...  There's a guy delivering a pizza.  Yeah, there's just a guy down the street.  And so you're seeing this?  So you're following him?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm following him at this point.  Now he's kind of under me.  But he's going to that house to deliver a pizza.  And I'm hovering over his car with the camera facing at the door.  And then he gets out.  He's got his pizzas.  And that's now the camera view instead of the...  The view of the camera. 
[03:45:30]  The view of the camera.  So it's much better quality.  And there he is.  And I'm just like...  Look, he doesn't even notice it.  Are you a voyeur?  No, but I think this is pretty fucking cool.  Yeah, it is.  Like, it's just people's shit going on in the neighborhood.  So you don't think they go fuck with him just to zip by, like, close?  Oh, I could definitely do that.  Which camera feed are you looking at while it's in the sky?  I'm looking at one from the top of the thing.  It's a new camera that I popped up.  But now the people come to the door and you see one of the little kids, like, now he can 
[03:46:00]  see it.  So he's kind of like, what the fuck is...  The kid is looking at it?  Yeah, the kid, like, points at it.  There's the father getting the pizza.  And the kid goes, hey, what the fuck is that?  Yeah, the little kid's with imagination.  So the only one's looking at that stuff.  So then, of course, I just peel away and fly off somewhere else.  But that's got to be just to be like, what is that?  My fucking neighbors are insane.  Can you imagine if that's, like, in Afghanistan, where you're just like, hey, what is that?  And then a hellfire missile shoots up your ass. 
[03:46:30]  Gigantic missile.  Yeah.  But, well, I had a good year of having fun with this, with the whole drone thing.  Do you think you'll make it to the summer?  I will tell you, they are going to legislate against this before the summer.  Oh.  I think within a matter of weeks, as a matter of fact, because of what happened at Kennedy,  they're going to be like, this is just too dangerous to have.  Look at how that camera compensates for every move.  It's just amazing. 
[03:47:00]  Wow.  I like the fucking technology behind it.  How does it know?  It's definitely in the summer.  You have to go, like when people are swimming by the pool in their bikinis?  Yes.  I have a pool.  I can just hover it above there with the camera facing down.  They'll never know.  I once stood in the Riviera Hotel and looked at, I was so, there was no internet porn then,  and just see who I can see in a bikini and just jerk off at the window.  What fun. 
[03:47:30]  That is good.  With this thing?  Oh, I know.  I'm going to change the game.  I'm a pisser.  That's all I want to do now.  I got like a million of these videos up there.  And I'm sure the FAA and Homeland Security are viewing them right now as we speak.  Fuck TSA.  They just, well, there's an anti-terrorism task force that's looking into the Kennedy Airport  thing, and the FAA is looking into it.  And then some guy on Twitter fucking had the New York, like, aviation or something, Twitter, 
[03:48:00]  and they're like, Anthony Kubias got one, and he lives near there.  Like, really, dude?  Really?  You need to do that?  You fucking asshole?  It's not even funny.  It's like, why the fuck are you doing that?  I know.  But look, it's not me.  You're supposed to be like a fan of the show.  I was not flying that around.  Stop it.  You're just ratting me out.  First of all, I'm not flying.  That's what I didn't even do.  I didn't do anything.  I wouldn't fly it around Kennedy, that's for sure.  And it was much too windy to fly yesterday.  I would probably, man. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, they have to regulate it.  Right?  Dude, there's too many.  I'm thinking of the stuff I would do, and I'm pretty smart.  Of horrible things.  I would try to stay behind a plane and see how long I'd keep up with it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, see?  Not good.  Yeah.  Right there.  Not good.  I took it up at night once.  Yeah?  Which was pretty fucking...  Is the night one on there?  I took it up at night, and...  How much weight can yours support?  A few pounds.  Definitely.  Enough to really do damage.  I think it's...  Scroll down. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, that one.  There's lights on the bottom of it, so you can kind of tell which way it's facing.  And it was just like...  It was really creepy, and people had to think there was some kind of fucking UFO, because...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was kind of...  I remember doing this, because I might have had a couple of drinks to think that I was  going to take it up there at night.  Like, why would I do that if I could only see it with the fucking lights?  Although, I have that one switch. 
[03:49:30]  You can just flip the switch, and it'll come back to wherever it took off from.  So if I ever lose it, you can just...  How does it know not to hit anything on the way back?  Well, that's just it.  It will go up to...  It'll stop.  It'll go up to a certain altitude.  You could set it to go up to 200 feet, if you want.  And then it'll go back, and then it'll land.  So it won't, like, run into telephone poles or trees if it's at a low altitude.  Okay.  It'll know.  And that's, like, all the lights of the...  Oh, telephone wires.  That's got to be a problem.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:50:00]  You don't want to hit any of those.  Dude, that's beautiful.  But it's, like, at night, right?  Isn't that fucking cool as shit?  See all the lights unfold?  Yeah.  It's, like, getting higher and higher.  You see the horizon and a little glow from New York City.  Do you get stoned and do this?  Hmm?  Do you get stoned and do this?  You never get stoned.  No, I don't get stoned, but I love a good drink.  Yeah.  I'll fucking catch a little buzz and just be like, this is cool.  It's like you're virtually flying through the night.  You know?  Yeah.  It's just fun.  It's kind of like a video game.  And you remember those simulators, those flight simulators?  Yeah, yeah.  They were just so boring. 
[03:50:30]  You couldn't do anything.  Yeah.  This is so much better than that.  This is a real fucking, like, simulator.  You're a first-person view of what you're doing, and you're controlling it just by using that.  Wow.  Yeah, and that was a lot of fun.  I don't do that anymore at night, though.  Why?  I got a little scared.  What do you think?  I was like, I don't want to lose it.  I don't want it crashing down into...  It's kind of hard to see at night. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Even though, like I said, you could bring it back, but I don't think you're supposed to.  It's probably against the rules of radio control shit to fly at night.  Although I would love to get fucking night vision for the camera and then pop it up there  because that could look really fucking cool.  You've got to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, do it fast.  Yeah, you definitely should get night vision.  Yeah, that would be fucking cool.  Now you could, like, start looking at people's backyards during parties.  Ari's going to want to come over.  You know, only the stuff that...  Yeah, Ari's going to be over the house this summer.  What can I come over and play? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, that's pretty high up.  That's like what you see out of an airplane window when you're landing.  It really is.  But I wasn't up that high.  It just looks that way.  I swear, FAA and fucking Homeland Security.  This is good.  You know, enjoy it.  Go to the website and enjoy the video because I don't really see much of this.  You think before summer?  Which sucks.  Wow.  But I think so.  Oh, what's that?  What's that in the air?  Okay.  Is it? 
[03:52:00]  That's how you turn around like, get the fuck out of here.  That's far away, though.  Yeah, the FAA is going to disable like watching these videos on YouTube.  They're not even going to let you watch the videos.  No.  Evidence.  Yeah.  Too tempting.  What a beautiful night view, though, of Long Island.  That's awesome.  That's very nice.  God.  All right.  Well, hopefully they're not banging on my door tonight.  Muscomia!  Muscomia!  What agency is this?  I don't like when agencies visit me. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, between the fucking, me trying to defend the Second Amendment, and then now the drones,  which I have no defense for.  The Second Amendment, at least I could say, hey, it's a right.  I could argue the constitutionality of it.  This is just, it's fun!  Why do you have it?  And why should you having it outweigh the safety of people?  Funness!  It's so fun!  I don't know if that's going to stand up.  No, no.  I don't think I have a right to fun.  But I said we! 
[03:53:00]  The right to bear fun!  Dude, I want to do a podcast with you about gun control.  Oh, fuck yeah!  Okay, cool.  Do it in a second.  All right, we'll do it sometime.  Let me, uh, I'll give you my number and shit.  Okay.  All right, 516.  Oh, oh shit.  All right.  Uh, Iraq!  Who the fuck is that?  It's an intern.  Who is that?  What are you, what's going on?  Who the fuck are you?  It's the new intern girl.  Who are the interns?  Who the fuck are you?  An intern at the board.  Where's my fucking money?  Fargo. 
[03:53:30]  You owe me money.  Where's my fucking money?  Who the fuck are you?  Serious sex out.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah!  I could turn that back to where it was.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Opie's been out, but his mic has more boom on it.  Yeah.  And so, yesterday, when I started talking, Ant yelled at me and told me I needed to bring 
[03:54:00]  my mic down lower than I was.  You're not Opie.  Yeah.  You don't get that.  What's wrong with him?  Jim usually informs us of what's going on with Opie.  He said yesterday that Opie had gotten a rare sickness from swallowing jizz.  Like, his stomach had become full of semen.  Oh, yeah.  That is...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so, when he was sick again today, Jim said, yeah, he just found out, you know,  the more you eat, the sicker he gets.  Was he trying to eat his way out of sickness?  I don't know. 
[03:54:30]  Hopefully, though, he's going jizz-free, I've heard.  The cum burps are really...  Is that what it is?  It's really, it's just, it's painful going up.  It burns.  Because it bubbles is the problem.  It just covers so much area.  It's hard to breathe.  It's disgusting.  Your story was incredible.  The one of you just meeting that chick on Twitter.  Oh, yeah.  Like, so, Ari, he's from L.A., so you don't have a place in New York.  You're looking for a place.  I'm looking for an apartment.  Because anybody knows of a good sublux or something. 
[03:55:00]  The last time you did this, he got banged.  Yeah, it was probably a bad idea.  Or a good idea.  But, yeah, so he goes, he's on Twitter, and he goes, hey, who's got a spot for me to sleep in?  Just last night.  Right.  And then some chick...  I'm glad to be here early in the morning.  Some random chick is just like, yeah, why don't you come over to my dad's apartment, and I'll be there, too.  Well, she just, yeah, she just said, yeah, my dad has a place to stay out, and you can stay out.  I'm like, are you serious?  I would totally use that if you're serious.  Because fans help you sometimes.  Yeah.  Have you ever stayed at a fan's place before? 
[03:55:30]  Uh-uh.  I didn't expect her to...  When the first...  When the offer came out, I didn't expect anyone to be there.  But then when it was a pretty girl who wanted to be there, I was like, oh, all right.  You can be there, too, I suppose.  Slumber party.  It was...  The craziest part to me, though, because you came in saying, like, who's ever banged a mom?  And the fact that this woman, who just randomly invited you to her house for sex, because you know that was her plan now.  I guess so.  She wasn't being a good citizen.  She wanted some sex from you.  Well, she got it. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, three times.  Yeah.  But she had kids.  What did you say?  What were their ages?  Five and under.  See, all it makes me think is, like, there's, like, a five-year-old whose mom is away from them for one night.  She's got secrets.  And she's just, like, twittering comedians and fucking them.  Yeah.  That's crazy to me.  Dude, when I walked down here, maybe it's because of last night, but when I walked down here, I was passing by all the women in their business suits and stuff.  And I just...  On the same streets, people walk by when they're drunk and stuff, you know, six, seven hours before. 
[03:56:30]  And I just imagine all these girls with their secrets.  I'm like, oh, you got fucked behind the alley last night.  Well, yeah.  Oh, you just...  You jerked off a guy.  It's got to change your whole viewpoint on everything.  Like, I look at my wife, who I think is...  It's just...  Oh, that's who I stayed over with.  What?  God damn it.  She said she was working all night.  And that was suspicious.  She was working.  She was getting work.  Oh, God damn it.  Yeah, but, like, we just have, like, a normal, healthy... 
[03:57:00]  Relationship.  Run-of-the-mill relationship.  So I don't have those thoughts.  I don't think that's normal.  You don't?  I think that's abnormal now.  The healthy relationship?  I think you'd be surprised at how many people have done fun, weird shit.  Yeah.  Because I'm like, really?  Yeah.  This girl's divorced and all, so it's not like she's, like...  I know, but just the fact that she's got kids, and she's like, I need you to take the kids.  I'm gonna...  Because you'd think, like, an irresponsible, like, fresh-out-of-her-teens, drunk-20-something  would do that.  Not a woman. 
[03:57:30]  A woman who's experienced some life, who's given birth to children.  Like, a five-year-old is going like, Mommy, what are you doing?  And she's like, I'm on the computer, and I'm randomly tweeting some comedian who I've never  met for sex.  It's gonna turn into boning.  Yeah.  Like, I'm aware of how I viewed my mother at five.  Yeah.  Horrified, if I would ever think.  I asked my mom recently, because I just started seeing, like, everybody as full humans.  Like, everyone as equals.  Oh, like, so you're not idealizing your parents forever? 
[03:58:00]  No, not that, but I realized, like, you all went through regular human histories and emotions  and stuff.  So I asked my mom, like, did you have sex with Dad before you got married?  And it just hit me, like, you probably dated at some point.  Dad probably wanted to.  And that was just now you were thinking that.  Yeah, and she was like, you don't ask that of your mother!  She got really mad.  I was like, it worked out.  Yeah.  It's not like you just didn't left.  If you did, it's okay.  Yeah.  You're allowed to.  Yeah.  I would assume that they did.  I would assume so, too, but I don't know. 
[03:58:30]  Well, the way she reacted, I'm almost definitely, she did.  Yeah, and now she feels guilty about the fact that there was some pre-marriage sex.  Why?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Well, you have to do it.  Before you sign the paper, you can't do certain things with your body.  What's that?  The marriage license.  Oh.  It's just so dumb.  Yeah.  No, I don't, I don't understand the idea of even how you could get married before you  have sex.  Yeah.  Like, can you, just getting involved in that and then realizing that you're not at all 
[03:59:00]  physically compatible.  Like, holy shit.  And they're like, oh, well, enjoy the next 40 years.  And how do you break that to somebody?  Like, how do you break that to your wife?  Like, this isn't working at all.  You don't.  We just, we just got, you just deal with it.  Yeah, you would just stick with it for, for.  I guess if you're the type of person that wouldn't have sex before you got married.  I knew a guy who did that, who got, who, who, uh, he had sex, didn't have sex with his  wife before marriage, just got a couple of blowjobs.  Really?  And, uh.  How long were they, like, together before they got married? 
[03:59:30]  Maybe six months to a year.  They were religious Jews, though.  Okay.  But, um, then, um, the marriage started.  He had sex, I believe it was either four times in six years or six times in four years.  Either way, not enough.  And that's, and he's just starting to have sex with that chick?  Had a kid.  No, they got divorced now.  But he put four years, having gotten laid, at most, 1.5 times a year.  Off.  Like, you didn't sign up for that?  No.  No. 
[04:00:00]  How often do you have sex with your wife?  Probably, we try to, like, remain aware of what it is.  Like, we try to keep track of the number because we don't want to slip into the rut.  You know what I mean?  Never.  Yeah.  Right, so we try to do at least, like, two or three times a week.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  That's solid.  And, and if we get to three, though, we congratulate ourselves.  You're like, yeah.  But if we don't get to three, it's like, oh, fuck.  Do you ever just, like, uh, daytime just, like, see her and just, like, bend her over, like, a couch or something? 
[04:00:30]  I don't know, I don't know if I specifically bend her over a couch, but I have, yeah, just, like, randomly in the daytime.  Like, she walks by and accidentally her arm brushes against her leg?  Like, well, here's the problem with that, and I have done that, but the reason that that's a huge risk is because once you're married, there's no sort of, like, oh, this is so exciting.  Like, if she's not in the mood for that, she could easily be like, what are you doing?  Or, like, laugh at you, or just, and, and once that happens.  Once I'm not, once I'm not in the mood starts, it never stops. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  It's always on the table.  Yeah, and it's just such a shot to your pride.  Like, the fact that you're like, okay, I'm going to turn this woman on, and she's just laughing at you.  Like, what are you doing?  Knock it off.  What are you trying to do?  That's what I've got.  What are you trying to do, Sam?  What are you, well, if I have to tell you, I'm not going to do it.  You know what I'm trying to do.  And then it's just awkward.  I'm just going to go back to watching TV.  I didn't mean to ruin it.  I didn't mean, well, you did.  Are you married, Roland?  No.  You're not?  No.  Yeah, are you, uh, are you seeing anybody right now? 
[04:01:30]  Eh, it's...  On again, off again?  Yeah.  Roland has a tough time with women.  Why?  He just makes friends with them.  I friend him to death.  Because...  So you go, like, brunch and antiquing on Saturdays.  Because, antiquing.  Brunch and antiquing is what he said.  Have you ever a friend who has the same body type as you?  And he has trouble with women, too.  Always becomes friends with them.  Because...  He only fucks hookers now.  He's given up on regular women.  Have you ever gotten a hooker?  No, but it seems easier.  What?  I should go to the Charlie Sheen route. 
[04:02:00]  Just get a hooker.  Yeah.  It was easier.  I mean, it's definitely a relief.  Of course, it's easier, yeah.  Tension and build up.  And you have to worry about it as much.  Yeah, because he's spitting more on the girl, like, dinner, this and that.  Time spent, too.  Time.  Thinking about, oh my God.  Events.  Uh-huh.  Because this is what...  Because it's probably the same thing with your buddy.  But, like, I've seen girls around Roland.  And he's the big teddy bear.  We all...  We love Roland.  Yeah.  But when it's love with multiple O's, love Roland.  It's like, oh, no.  Roland.  And Roland's like, yeah, I mean, she seems interested. 
[04:02:30]  I go, Roland, she's not interested.  There were so many O's in that love.  And then, you know, he sits there.  But Roland's also, like, a sweet guy.  Yeah.  So, we'll buy cupcakes.  And we'll leave little gifts and stuff.  And it's just so much that they're just like, oh, this is great.  My friend really...  And the girls pretend not to realize that Roland has feelings for him.  Yeah.  They just accept all the gifts and niceness.  My friend told me this once.  This is way before he was only...  If I had accepted, like, I'm not going to have sex with regular girls. 
[04:03:00]  He said, um...  I had to stop by some 7-Eleven because I wanted to buy this plastic, like, blow-plop ring or something.  Or something like that.  And I was like, I got to get this for this girl that I'm friends with.  And he goes, Ari, don't be that guy.  He's like, there's two types of guys in the world.  There's a type of guy who buys girls little fake plastic rings or cupcakes or whatever.  Like, yeah, yeah, she'll like this.  And then there's this type of guy who fucks those women.  And they're not the same guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So true.  Yeah.  It is.  Because then, you know, Roland will text me. 
[04:03:30]  And I'll know whoever he's, like, you know, buying shit for.  Or, and he'll just be like, I'll be like, oh, why aren't you hanging out with so-and-so?  She's fucking some guy.  And he's mumbling himself.  But that's what happens.  Like, you know, they just accept the niceties and love the friendship and everything until...  Yeah, they accept all the cussing invites.  Right.  Except then they got plans.  You know what this is.  You should say no.  They should say no.  Yeah.  If girls want equality, you've got to start saying no when you have no intention to do what the guy wants you to do.  That's what I'm saying. 
[04:04:00]  You go to a VIP concert that's limited to, like, 300 people.  And you say yes.  Yeah.  That should be a date.  Yeah.  If you were best friends since you were in fourth grade, that's different.  Like, the girl should be, like, Roland.  I mean, I want to go, but...  Yeah.  But you have to know...  I don't see you that way.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I have a friend that, like, she's that way.  She goes, look, I'll hang out.  And she'll tell all the guys, like, but we're just friends.  Like, chill straight up.  But other girls, you go, hey, want to go see you, too?  Oh, yeah, let's go.  All right.  Scandalous.  Yeah.  Horrible.  But Ari's right. 
[04:04:30]  There's the...  With the two type of guys.  Yeah.  You're either friends with them, or you're one of the guys who's fucking them.  Yeah.  And, you know, you got to have confidence.  The body type thing is an issue.  You got to get yourself into shape.  You know that.  I know.  And not that shape.  When are you at, like, 205?  I don't know.  203?  You don't know, is that what you said?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You're way bigger than that.  Yeah, I know.  It's significantly larger.  I know.  It'd be nice.  Do you think you're three?  I think close to it.  You're about three goals.  That's a big number, man.  I know.  Three is a big number. 
[04:05:00]  That's like a...  May not come back.  Whoa.  That's not a lot of...  Prove him wrong, Roland.  Well, my friend, that's the same thing.  He's just over three.  I'm like, that means you're closer to 400 pounds than you are to 200 pounds, which is  also overweight.  Is that what it is?  Is it hard to go and try to exercise and get the pounds off?  Because you know, well, even if I lose 50 pounds, I'm still way overweight.  Hey, if you still lose 100 pounds, you'll be like, eh.  Right, right.  You still got work to do. 
[04:05:30]  I mean, but the problem...  The booze and the free food, though.  That's...  Yeah.  That's what it is.  What do you get free food here?  Oh, yeah.  From chefs and all restaurants.  And it's not just the free food.  Because they know you work at...  I know some of them, too, yeah.  So you get free...  Oh, free great food?  Yeah.  Five-star restaurants.  Dude.  Yeah, I'd be fat, too.  Just be a fat guy.  Just accept that.  Plus, you got guys like Troy who are bringing you out to...  Like, Troy, he works here.  He's, like, in good shape.  Mm-hmm.  But he brings Roland out to these giant meals. 
[04:06:00]  And then he works out like an anorexic the next day for two hours.  Right.  But he knows Roland's not going to do it.  I'm not going to do that.  But he will...  That's what Joe Rogan always says to me.  He's like, you've got to eat a salad.  I'm like, you ate a salad and four steaks in the same dinner.  And how are you, like, getting rid of all this?  Right.  I don't understand.  Well, because you can't...  Like, you can't bring somebody out to binge eat when you know they're not going to work  that shit all later.  It's the same thing as a girl's doing.  Like, you know the deal.  Yeah, you know what you're doing.  Yeah.  It's like, Troy, I take him out to the good places. 
[04:06:30]  I go, I know a great steak place.  Or I know a great place.  Mm-hmm.  And he'll go.  Yeah, he'll go.  Of course.  You're offering him some free steak.  He doesn't care that you're going to sit there and just indulge.  You're like, I'm going to turn this straight into fat.  It's delicious.  Yeah.  It's going to turn into muscle.  Yeah.  Because I'm going to go.  I'm going to eat.  But you think, like, shitting is like your exercise, right?  You're like, well, I took a big shit after that meal.  Yeah, I lost half of it.  Yeah.  I know a lot of fat guys who say that.  Like, you've got to take a shit once in a while.  I'm like, that's not how you lose weight.  Yeah.  Take a shit and lose it. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you understand.  I lost, like, probably 10 pounds from my colon over the last week.  So, no, that's just shit.  It's waste product.  That's delicious meals.  That is weird, though, with getting married and stuff and having to deal with sex.  Yeah.  Where it's like, when you're dating somebody, if they sleep over, you're fucking.  Yeah.  Unless you both get too drunk or something happens.  Uh-huh.  But then when you sleep with them or just living with somebody every night.  You're not going to have sex every night.  You're not going to have sex. 
[04:07:30]  So it has to be the first night where you're like, well, good night.  Right.  The majority of nights, you're going to just sleep.  That's so weird.  I mean, we had, like, I've been with my wife for eight years.  Over eight, eight and a half years.  So I'm optimistic, the fact that I'm not sick of her and we still have a healthy sex life,  that it's not going to go terrible.  At least anytime soon.  Yeah.  I mean, eight years is long.  It's a long time.  Right.  So it's not like we've been together three years and things are starting to get shaky. 
[04:08:00]  Like, we're past that.  Right.  But, yeah, I mean, what would happen is, because of this job, because I wake up so early in the morning,  I'd go over to her house before we were living together, but I would pass out because I was tired.  Right.  So it's like now, so that wasn't even a thing for us.  But you're right.  When you start to move in, you realize you're going to be fucking every night.  Honeymoon's over.  That's what they mean, I guess.  Yeah.  Are you going to stay with this chick tonight?  No, I'm going back with Steve to Long Island.  Oh, that's because she was. 
[04:08:30]  Did people find her on Twitter?  Yeah.  How?  I guess they just.  I don't follow many people.  Oh.  So then I followed her just so I could DM her.  I follow people just so I could DM them and then I follow them.  But I forgot to.  I didn't do the math and fucking the ONA virus people.  And you announced on the air.  Yeah, I followed her.  And they're like, get on their computers.  It was like, it was like either her or Roseanne Barr.  It was like, it wasn't probably her.  So.  Have you unfollowed her?  Yeah, I unfollowed.  As soon as I realized.  As soon as I got a text, I'm like, oh crap, unfollow, sorry. 
[04:09:00]  Did she know the relationship is over now?  Well, she knew what.  I mean, she wasn't like fooling herself.  It was fun.  I just met her and we had some fun.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Because otherwise she'd.  I have kids and they like you too.  They love comedy.  I don't understand why you would do this to us.  To my family.  Yeah, when she says you'd do this to us, that's when you know the Twitter game is never being played again.  Look, I know I shouldn't be this hard right now, but the way you say your family's in pain just gets me rock hard. 
[04:09:30]  Well, you say us.  I don't know what it is about that pronoun.  Well, you can get Ari's special on, what is it?  Chill.com.  Chill.com.  Or my website, AriShaffir.com or AriTheGreat.com.  And then you're in Vancouver, March 23rd.  Are you plugging these New York dates?  Stand Up New York and Gotham?  Oh, Gotham's tonight.  Right.  So Gotham's tonight.  Me and Kurt Metzger and Steve Renazzisi will be there.  They're all hilarious.  Comedy Juice at 10 p.m.  All right.  So check that out.  Sure.  Short sets. 
[04:10:00]  Fuck it.  Come on out if you're looking for something to do.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  And I'm doing 420 shows.  That's what I got.  Big 420 shows.  In Seattle, at the parlor, and in Olympia at some pot dispensary.  It's very exciting.  We're celebrating legalized weed.  In Colorado.  In Washington State.  Oh, in Washington State?  Yeah.  Seattle, Washington.  Did I say Colorado?  I thought you did.  I might have.  I'm really bad at promoting when I get the wrong city and state.  It's Seattle.  All right.  Ron and Fezzer coming up next.  Thank you, Ari.  Oh, fuck.
